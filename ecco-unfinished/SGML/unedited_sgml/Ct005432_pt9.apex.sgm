<P>WHATEVER Apologies it might become me to make at any other time for writing to you, I &s;hall u&s;e none now, to a man who has own'd him&s;elf as &s;plenetic as a Cat in the Country. In that circum&s;tance, I know by experience a letter is a very u&s;eful, as well as amu&s;ing thing: If you are too bu&s;ied in State affairs to read it, yet you may find entertainment in folding it into divers figures, either doubling it into a pyrami|dical, or twi&s;ting it into a &s;erpentine form:
<PB N="4" REF="20">
or, if your di&s;po&s;ition &s;hould not be &s;o mathe|matical, in taking it with you to that place where men of &s;tudious minds are apt to &s;it longer than ordinary; where, after an abrupt divi&s;ion of the paper, it may not be unplea&s;ant to try to fit and rejoin the broken lines toge|ther. All the&s;e amu&s;ements I am no &s;tranger to in the Country, and doubt not but (by this time) you begin to reli&s;h them, in your pre|&s;ent contemplative &s;ituation.</P>
<P>I remember a man, who was thought to have &s;ome knowledge in the world, u&s;ed to affirm, that no people in town ever complain|ed they were forgotten by their Friends in the country: but my encrea&s;ing experience con|vinces me he was mi&s;taken, for I find a great many here grievou&s;ly complaining of you, up|on this &s;core. I am told further, that you treat the few you corre&s;pond with in a very ar|rogant &s;tyle, and tell them you admire at their in&s;olence in di&s;turbing your meditations, or even enquiring of your<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Some time before the Death of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> when her Mini&s;ters were quarrel|ling, and the Dean could not reconcile them, he retired to a Friend's Hou&s;e in Berk|&s;hire, and never &s;aw them after.

to him once &s;ince you went: but this perhaps may be only policy, in him or you: and I, who am half a Whig, mu&s;t not entirely credit any thing he affirms. At Button's it is reported you are gone to Hanover, and that Gay goes only on an Emba&s;&s;y to you. Others apprehend &s;ome dangerous State treati&s;e from your re|tirement; and a Wit, who affects to imitate Bal&s;ac, &s;ays, that the Mini&s;try now are like tho&s;e Heathens of old, who received their Oracles from the Woods.

But you mu&s;t give me leave to add one thing, that you talk at your ea&s;e, being wholly unconcerned in public events: For, if your friends the Whigs continue, you may hope for &s;ome favour; if the Tories re|turn, you are at lea&s;t &s;ure of quiet. You know how well I loved both Lord Oxford and Bo|lingbroke, and how dear the Duke of Ormond is to me: Do you imagine I can be ea&s;y while their enemies are endeavouring to take off their heads? <HI>I nunc, &amp; ver&s;us tecum meditare canoros</HI>&mdash;Do you imagine I can be ea&s;y, when I think of the probable con&s;equences of the&s;e proceed|ings,

<P>I borrowed your Homer from the Bi&s;hop (mine is not yet landed) and read it out in two evenings. If it plea&s;eth others as well as me, you have got your end in profit and reputation: Yet I am angry at &s;ome bad Rhymes and Triplets, and pray in your next do not let me have &s;o many unju&s;tifiable Rhymes to <HI>war</HI> and <HI>gods.</HI> I tell you all the faults I know, only in one or two places you are a little ob&s;cure; but I expected you to be &s;o in one or two and twenty. I have heard no &s;oul talk of it here, for indeed it is not come over; nor do we very much abound in Judges, at lea&s;t I have not the honour to be acquainted with them. Your Notes are perfectly good, and &s;o are your Preface and E&s;&s;ay. You were pretty bold in mentioning Lord Bolingbroke in that Pre|face.

I look upon a friend in Ireland as upon a friend in the other world, whom (popi&s;hly-&s;peaking) I believe con&s;tantly well-di&s;po&s;ed towards me, and ready to do me all the good he can, in that &s;tate of &s;eparation, though I hear nothing from him, and make ad|dre&s;&s;es to him but very rarely.

<P>I Had the favour of yours by Mr. F. of whom, before any other que&s;tion relating to your health or fortune, or &s;ucce&s;s as a Poet, I en|quired your principles in the common form, "Is he Whig or a Tory?" I am &s;orry to find they are not &s;o well tallied to the pre&s;ent jun|cture as I could wi&s;h. I always thought the terms of <HI>Facto</HI> and <HI>Jure</HI> had been introduced by the Poets, and that Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any &s;ort in
<PB N="13" REF="29">
Kings was held an unexceptionable title in the courts of Parna&s;&s;us. If you do not grow a per|fect good &s;ubject in all its pre&s;ent latitudes, I &s;hall conclude you are become rich, and able to live without dedications to men in power, whereby one great inconvenience will follow, that you and the world and po&s;terity will be ut|terly ignorant of their Virtues. For, either your brethren have mi&s;erably deceived us the&s;e hun|dred years pa&s;t, or Power confers Virtue, as naturally as five of your Popi&s;h &s;acraments do Grace.&mdash;You &s;leep le&s;s and drink more.&mdash;But your ma&s;ter Horace was <HI>Vini &s;omnique benig|nus:</HI> and, as I take it, both are proper for your trade. As to mine, there are a thou&s;and poe|tical texts to confirm the one; and as to the other, I know it was anciently the cu&s;tom to &s;leep in Temples for tho&s;e who would con&s;ult the Oracles, "Who dictates to me &s;lumbring <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Milton.</NOTE>," &amp;c.</P>
<P>You are an ill Catholick, or a wor&s;e Geo|grapher, for I can a&s;&s;ure you, Ireland is not Pa|radi&s;e, and I appeal even to any Spani&s;h divine whether Addre&s;&s;es were ever made to a friend in Hell, or Purgatory? And who are all the&s;e enemies you hint at? I can only think of Curl, Gildon, Squire Burnet, Blackmore, and a few
<PB N="14" REF="30">
others who&s;e &s;ame I have forgot; Tools, in my opinion as nece&s;&s;ary for a good writer, as pen, ink, and paper. And be&s;ides, I would fain know whether every Draper doth not &s;hew you three or four damn'd pieces of &s;tuff to &s;et off his good one? However, I will grant, that one tho|rough Book&s;elling-Rogue is better qualified to vex an author, than all his cotemporary &s;crib|lers in Critic or Satire, not only by &s;tolen Co|pies of what was incorrect or unfit for the pub|lic, but by downright laying other mens dul|ne&s;s at your door. I had a long de&s;ign upon the Ears of that Curl, when I was in credit, but the Rogue would never allow me a fair &s;troke at them, although my penknife was ready drawn and &s;harp. I can hardly believe the re|lation of his being poi&s;oned, although the Hi|&s;torian pretends to have been an eye-witne&s;s: But I beg pardon, Sack might do it, although Rats-bane would not. I never &s;aw the thing you mention as fal&s;ely imputed to you; but I think the frolicks of merry hours, even when we are guilty, &s;hould not be left to the mercy of our be&s;t friends, until Curl and his re&s;em|blers are hang'd.</P>
<P>With &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the better judgment of you and your friends, I take your project of an employment under the Turks to be idle and unnece&s;&s;ary. Have a little patience, and you
<PB N="15" REF="31">
will find more merit and encouragement at home by the &s;ame methods. You are ungrate|ful to your country; quit but your own Religion, and ridicule ours, and that will allow you a free choice for any other, or for none at all, and pay you well into the bargain. Therefore pray do not run and di&s;grace us among the Turks, by telling them you were forced to leave your native home, becau&s;e we would oblige you to be a Chri&s;tian; whereas we will make it appear to all the world, that we only compelled you to be a Whig.</P>
<P>There is a young ingenious Quaker in this town who writes ver&s;es to his mi&s;tre&s;s, not very correct, but in a &s;train purely what a poetical Quaker &s;hould do, commending her look and ha|bit, &amp;c. It gave me a hint that a &s;ett of Qua|ker pa&s;torals might &s;ucceed, if our friend Gay<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Gay did write a pa&s;toral of this kind, which is pub|li&s;hed in his works.</NOTE> could fancy it, and I think it a fruitful &s;ubject; pray hear what he &s;ays.

Or what think you of a Newgate|pa&s;toral, among the whores and thieves there.</P>

<P>A Thou&s;and things have vexed me of late years, upon which I am determined to lay open my mind to you. I rather chu&s;e to ap|peal to you than to my Lord Chief Ju&s;tice Whit|&s;hed, under the &s;ituation I am in. For, I take this cau&s;e properly to lie before you: You are a much fitter Judge of what concerns the cre|dit of a Writer, the injuries that are done him, and the reparations he ought to receive. Be|&s;ides, I doubt whether the Arguments I could

<P>Give me leave then to put you in mind (al|though you cannot ea&s;ily forget it) that about ten weeks before the Queen's death, I left the town, upon occa&s;ion of that incurable breach among the great men at Court, and went down to Berk&s;hire, where you may remember that you gave me the favour of a vi&s;it. While I was in that retirement, I writ a Di&s;cour&s;e which I thought might be u&s;eful in &s;uch a juncture of affairs, and &s;ent it up to London; but, upon &s;ome difference in opinion between me and a certain great Mini&s;ter now abroad, the pub|li&s;hing of it was deferred &s;o long that the Queen died, and I recalled my copy, which hath been ever &s;ince in &s;afe hands. In a few weeks after the lo&s;s of that excellent Prince&s;s, I came to my &s;tation here; where I have continued ever &s;ince in the greate&s;t privacy, and utter igno|rance of tho&s;e events, which are mo&s;t common|ly talked of in the world. I neither know the names nor number of the Royal Family which now reigns, further than the Prayer-book in|forms me. I cannot tell who is Chancellor,
<PB N="18" REF="34">
who are Secretaries, nor with what nations we are in peace or war. And this manner of life was not taken up out of any &s;ort of Affectation, but merely to avoid giving offence, and for fear of provoking Party-zeal.</P>
<P>I had indeed written &s;ome Memorials of the four la&s;t years of the Queen's reign, with &s;ome other informations, which I receiv'd, as nece&s;|&s;ary materials to qualify me for doing &s;omething in an employment then de&s;igned me <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;toriographer. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>: But, as it was at the di&s;po&s;al of a per&s;on, who had not the &s;malle&s;t &s;hare of &s;teddine&s;s or &s;incerity, I di&s;dained to accept it.</P>

was &s;eized, and forced to give great bail: af|ter his trial the Jury brought him in Not Guil|ty, although they had been culled with the utmo&s;t indu&s;try; the Chief Ju&s;tice &s;ent them back nine times, and kept them eleven hours, until being perfectly tired out, they were forced to leave the matter to the mercy of the Judge, by what they call a &s;pecial Verdict. During the trial, the Chief Ju&s;tice, among other &s;in|gularities, laid his hand on his brea&s;t, and pro|te&s;ted &s;olemnly that the Author's de&s;ign was to bring in the Pretender; although there was not a &s;ingle &s;yllable of Party in the whole Trea|ti&s;e, and although it was known that the mo&s;t eminent of tho&s;e who profe&s;&s;ed his own prin|ciples, publickly di&s;allowed his proceedings. But the cau&s;e being &s;o very odious and impo|pular, the trial of the Verdict was deferred from one Term to another, until upon the Duke of G&mdash;ft-n the Lord Lieutenant's arrival, his Grace, after mature advice, and permi&s;&s;ion from Eng|land, was plea&s;ed to grant a <HI>noli pro&s;equi.</HI></P>
<P>This is the more remarkable, becau&s;e it is &s;aid that the man is no ill decider in common ca&s;es of property, where Party is out of the que&s;tion; but when that intervenes, with am|bition at heels to pu&s;h it forward, it mu&s;t needs confound any man of little &s;pirit, and low birth, who hath no other endowment than that &s;ort

<P>Indeed I have formerly delivered my thoughts very freely, whether I were a&s;ked or no; but never affected to be a Councellor, to which I had no manner of call. I was humbled enough to &s;ee my&s;elf &s;o far out-done by the Earl of Oxford in my own trade as a Scholar, and too good a Courtier not to di&s;cover his contempt of tho&s;e who would be men of importance out of their &s;phere. Be&s;ides, to &s;ay the truth, although I have known many great Mini&s;ters ready e|nough
<PB N="23" REF="39">
to hear Opinions, yet I have hardly &s;een one that would ever de&s;cend to take Advice; and this pedantry ari&s;eth from a Maxim them|&s;elves do not believe at the &s;ame time they prac|ti&s;e by it, that there is &s;omething profound in Politics, which men of plain hone&s;t &s;en&s;e can|not arrive to.</P>
<P>I only wi&s;h my endeavours had &s;ucceeded better in the great point I had at heart, which was that of reconciling the Mini&s;ters to each other. This might have been done, if others, who had more concern and more influence, would have acted their parts; and, if this had &s;ucceeded, the public intere&s;t both of Church and State would not have been the wor&s;e, nor the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion endangered.</P>
<P>But, whatever opportunities a con&s;tant at|tendance of four years might have given me for endeavouring to do good offices to particu|lar per&s;ons, I de&s;erve at lea&s;t to find tolerable quarter from tho&s;e of the other Party; for many of which I was a con&s;tant advocate with the Earl of Oxford, and for this I appeal to his Lord&s;hip: He knows how often I pre&s;&s;ed him in favour of Mr. Addi&s;on, Mr. Congreve, Mr. Row, and Mr. Steel; although I freely confe&s;s that his Lord&s;hip's kindne&s;s to them was alto|gether owing to his generous notions, and the e&s;teem he had for their wit and parts, of which
<PB N="24" REF="40">
I could only pretend to be a remembrance$. For I can never forget the an&s;wer he gave to the late Lord Hallifax, who upon the fir&s;t change of the Mini&s;try interceded with him to &s;pare Mr. Congreve: It was by repeating the&s;e two lines of Virgil,
<Q><L>Non obtu&s;a adeo ge&s;tamus pectora Poeni,</L>
<L>Nec tam aver&s;us equos Tyria Sol jungit ab urbe.</L></Q>
Pur&s;uant to which, he always treated Mr. Con|greve with the greate&s;t per&s;onal civilities, a&s;&s;u|ring him of his con&s;tant favour and protection, and adding that he would &s;tudy to do &s;ome|thing better for him.</P>
<P>I remember it was in tho&s;e times a u&s;ual &s;ubject of raillery towards me among the Mi|ni&s;ters, that I never came to them without a Whig in my &s;leeve; which I do not &s;ay with any view towards making my Court: For, the new Principles<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">He means particularly the principle at that time charged upon them, by their Enemies, of an intention <HI>to pro&s;cribe the Tories.</HI></NOTE> fixed to tho&s;e of that denomi|nation, I did then, and do now from my heart abhor, dete&s;t, and abjure, as wholly degenerate from their predece&s;&s;ors. I have conver&s;ed in &s;ome freedom with more Mini&s;ters of State of all parties than u&s;ually happens to men of my level, and, I confe&s;s, in their capacity as Mi|ni&s;ters,
<PB N="25" REF="41">
I look upon them as a race of people who&s;e acquaintance no man would court, other|wi&s;e than upon the &s;core of Vanity or Ambi|tion. The fir&s;t quickly wears off (and is the Vice of low minds, for a man of &s;pirit is too proud to be vain) and the other was not my ca&s;e. Be&s;ides, having never received more than one &s;mall favour, I was under no nece&s;|&s;ity of being a &s;lave to men in power, but cho&s;e my friends by their per&s;onal merit, without examining how far their notions agreed with the politics then in vogue. I frequently con|ver&s;ed with Mr. Addi&s;on, and the others I named (except Mr. Steel) during all my Lord Oxford's Mini&s;try, and Mr. Addi&s;on's friend|&s;hip to me continued inviolable, with as much kindne&s;s as when we u&s;ed to meet at my Lord Sommers<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Lord Sommers had very warmly recommended Dr. Swift to the favour of Lord Wharton when he went the Queen's Lieutenant into Ire|land, in the year 17$9.</NOTE> or Hallifax, who were leaders of the oppo&s;ite Party.</P>
<P>I would infer from all this, that it is with great inju&s;tice I have the&s;e many years been pelted by your Pamphleteers, merely upon ac|count of &s;ome regard which the Queen's la&s;t Mini&s;ters were plea&s;ed to have for me: and yet in my con&s;cience I think I am a partaker in every ill de&s;ign they had again&s;t the Prote&s;tant
<PB N="26" REF="42">
Succe&s;&s;ion, or the Liberties and Religion of their Country; and can &s;ay with Cicero, <Q>&startq;that I &s;hould be proud to be included with them in all their actions <HI>tanquam in equo Trojano.&endq;</HI></Q> But if I have never di&s;covered by my words, writ|ings, or actions, any Party virulence <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Examiners,</HI> I &s;up|po&s;e, were not then publi&s;hed among&s;t the Dean's works.</NOTE>, or dan|gerous de&s;igns again&s;t the pre&s;ent powers; if my friend&s;hip and conver&s;ation were equally &s;hewn among tho&s;e who liked or di&s;approved the proceedings then at Court, and that I was known to be a common Friend of all de&s;erv|ing per&s;ons of the latter &s;ort, when they were in di&s;tre&s;s; I cannot but think it hard, that I am not &s;uffered to run quietly among the com|mon herd of people, who&s;e opinions unfortu|nately differ from tho&s;e which lead to Favour and Preferment.</P>
<P>I ought to let you know, that the Thing we called a Whig in England is a creature altoge|ther different from tho&s;e of the &s;ame denomi|nation here; at lea&s;t it was &s;o during the reign of her late Maje&s;ty. Whether tho&s;e on your &s;ide have changed or no <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">He &s;ays before, that they had changed.</NOTE>, it hath not been my bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire. I remember my excellent friend Mr. Addi&s;on, when he fir&s;t came over hither Secretary to the Earl of Wharton then
<PB N="27" REF="43">
Lord Lieutenant, was extremely offended at the conduct and di&s;cour&s;e of the Chief Mana|gers here: He told me they were a &s;ort of peo|ple who &s;eemed to think, that the principles of a Whig con&s;i&s;ted in nothing el&s;e but damning the Church, reviling the Clergy, abetting the Di&s;&s;enters, and &s;peaking contemptibly of re|vealed Religion.</P>
<P>I was di&s;cour&s;ing &s;ome years ago with a cer|tain Mini&s;ter about that whiggi&s;h or fanatical Genius, &s;o prevalent among the Engli&s;h of this kingdom: his Lord&s;hip accounted for it by that number of Cromwell's Soldiers, adven|turers e&s;tabli&s;hed here, who were all of the &s;oure&s;t leven, and the meane&s;t birth, and who&s;e po&s;terity are now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their lands and their principles. However, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that of late &s;ome people in this country are grown weary of quarrelling, be|cau&s;e intere&s;t, the great motive of quarrelling, is at an end; for, it is hardly worth contend|ing who &s;hall be an Exci&s;eman, a Country-Vicar, a Cryer in the Courts, or an Under-Clerk.</P>
<P>You will perhaps be inclined to think, that a per&s;on &s;o ill treated as I have been, mu&s;t at &s;ome time or other have di&s;covered very dan|gerous opinions in government; in an&s;wer to which, I will tell you what my Political prin|ciples
<PB N="28" REF="44">
were in the time of her late glorious Ma|je&s;ty, which I never contradicted by any action, writing, or di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I always declared my&s;elf again&s;t a Popi&s;h Succe&s;&s;or to the Crown, whatever Ti|tle he might have by the proximity of blood: Neither did I ever regard the right line, except upon two accounts: fir&s;t, as it was e&s;tabli&s;hed by law; and &s;econdly, as it hath much weight in the opinions of the people. For nece&s;&s;ity may aboli&s;h any Law, but cannot alter the &s;entiments of the vulgar; Right of inheritance being perhaps the mo&s;t popular of all topics: and therefore in great Changes when that is broke, there will remain much heart-burning and di&s;content among the meaner people; which (under a weak Prince and corrupt Admini&s;tra|tion) may have the wor&s;t con&s;equences upon the peace of any &s;tate.</P>
<P>As to what is called a Revolution-principle, my opinion was this; That whenever tho&s;e evils, which u&s;ually attend and follow a violent change of Government, were not in probabi|lity &s;o pernicious as the grievance we &s;uffer un|der a pre&s;ent power, then the public good will ju&s;tify &s;uch a Revolution. And this I took to have been the ca&s;e in the Prince of Orange's expedition, although in the con&s;equences it pro|duced
<PB N="29" REF="45">
&s;ome very bad effects, which are likely to &s;tick long enough by us.</P>
<P>I had likewi&s;e in tho&s;e days a mortal antipa|thy again&s;t Standing Armies in times of Peace: Becau&s;e I always took Standing Armies to be only &s;ervants hired by the Ma&s;ter of the family for keeping his own children in &s;lavery; and becau&s;e I conceived, that a Prince, who could not think him&s;elf &s;ecure without Mercenary Troops, mu&s;t needs have a &s;eparate intere&s;t from that of his Subjects. Although I am not ignorant of tho&s;e artificial Nece&s;&s;ities which a corrupted Mini&s;try can create, for keeping up Forces to &s;upport a Faction again&s;t the publick Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>As to Parliaments, I adored the wi&s;dom of that Gothic In&s;titution, which made them an|nual: and I was confident our Liberty could never be placed upon a firm foundation until that ancient law were re&s;tored among us. For, who &s;ees not, that, while &s;uch A&s;&s;emblies are permitted to have a longer duration, there grows up a commerce of corruption between the Mi|ni&s;try and the Deputies, wherein they both find their accounts, to the manife&s;t danger of Liber|ty? which Traffic would neither an&s;wer the de&s;ign nor expence, if Parliaments met once a year.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="46" MS="Y">
I ever abominated that &s;cheme of Politics, (now about thirty years old) of &s;etting up a monied Intere&s;t in oppo&s;ition to the landed. For I conceived, there could not be a truer maxim in our Government than this, That the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the &s;oil are the be&s;t Judges of what is for the advantage of the kingdom. If others had thought the &s;ame way, Funds of Credit and South-&s;ea Projects would neither have been felt nor heard of.</P>
<P>I could never di&s;cover the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;u&s;|pending any Law upon which the Liberty of the mo&s;t innocent per&s;ons depended; neither do I think this Practice hath made the ta&s;te of Arbitrary Power &s;o agreeable, as that we &s;hould de&s;ire to &s;ee it repeated. Every Rebellion &s;ub|dued and Plot di&s;covered, contribute to the firmer e&s;tabli&s;hed of the Prince: In the latter ca&s;e, the knot of Con&s;pirators is entirely broke, and they are to begin their work anew under a thou&s;and di&s;advantages; &s;o that tho&s;e diligent enquiries into remote and problematical guilt, with a new power of enforcing them by chains and dungeons to every per&s;on who&s;e face a Mi|ni&s;ter thinks fit to di&s;like, are not only oppo|&s;ite to that Maxim, which declareth it better that ten guilty men &s;hould e&s;cape, than one in|nocent &s;uffer; but likewi&s;e leave a gate wide
<PB N="31" REF="47">
open to the whole Tribe of Informers, the mo&s;t accur&s;ed, and pro&s;titute, and abandoned race, that God ever permitted to plague mankind.</P>
<P>It is true the Romans had a cu&s;tom of chu|&s;ing a Dictator, during who&s;e admini&s;tration the Power of other Magi&s;trates was &s;u&s;pended; but this was done upon the greate&s;t emergen|cies; a War near their doors, or &s;ome civil Di&s;&s;ention: For Armies mu&s;t be governed by arbitrary power. But when the Virtue of that Commonwealth gave place to luxury and am|bition, this very office of Dictator became per|petual in the per&s;ons of the Cae&s;ars and their Succe&s;&s;ors, the mo&s;t infamous Tyrants that have any where appeared in &s;tory.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome of the &s;entiments I had, re|lating to publick affairs, while I was in the world: what they are at pre&s;ent, is of little importance either to that or my&s;elf; neither can I truly &s;ay I have any at all, or, if I had, I dare not venture to publi&s;h them: For how|ever orthodox they may be while I am now writing, they may become criminal enough to bring me into trouble before mid&s;ummer. And indeed I have often wi&s;hed for &s;ome time pa&s;t, that a political Catechi&s;m might be publi&s;hed by authority four times a year, in order to in|&s;truct us how we are to &s;peak, write, and act during the current quarter. I have by expe|rience
<PB N="32" REF="48">
felt the want of &s;uch an in&s;tructer: For, intending to make my court to &s;ome people on the prevailing &s;ide, by advancing certain old whiggi&s;h principles, which, it &s;eems, had been exploded about a month before, I have pa&s;&s;ed for a di&s;affected per&s;on. I am not ignorant how idle a thing it is, for a man in ob&s;curity to at|tempt defending his reputation as a Writer, while the &s;pirit of Faction hath &s;o univer&s;ally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the minds of men, that they are not at lei&s;ure to attend to any thing el&s;e. They will ju&s;t give them&s;elves time to libel and ac|cu&s;e me, but cannot &s;pare a minute to hear my defence. So in a plot-di&s;covering age, I have often known an innocent man &s;eized and impri|&s;oned, and forced to lie &s;everal months in chains, while the Mini&s;ters were not at lei&s;ure to hear his petition, until they had pro&s;ecuted and hang|ed the number they propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>All I can rea&s;onably hope for by his letter, is to convince my friends, and others who are plea&s;ed to wi&s;h me well, that I have neither been &s;o ill a Subject nor &s;o &s;tupid an Author, as I have been repre&s;ented by the virulence of Libellers, who&s;e malice hath taken the &s;ame train in both, by fathering dangerous Princi|ples in government upon me, which I never maintained, and in&s;ipid Productions, which I am not capable of writing. For, however I
<PB N="33" REF="49">
may have been &s;oured by per&s;onal ill treat|ment, or by melancholy pro&s;pects for the pub|lic, I am too much a politician to expo&s;e my own &s;afety by offen&s;ive words. And, if my genius and &s;pirit be &s;unk by encrea&s;ing years, I have at lea&s;t enough di&s;cretion le$t, not to mi&s;|take the mea&s;ure of my own abilities, by at|tempting &s;ubjects where tho&s;e Talents are ne|ce&s;&s;ary, which perhaps I may have lo&s;t with my youth.</P>

<P>COming home after a &s;hort Chri&s;tmas ram|ble, I found a letter upon my table, and little expected when I opened it to read your name at the bottom. The be&s;t and greate&s;t part of my life, until the&s;e la&s;t eight years, I &s;pent in England; there I made my friend&s;hips, and there I left my de&s;ires. I am condemned for ever to another country; what is in pru|duence to be done? I think, to be <HI>oblitu&s;que meorum, oblivi&s;cendus &amp; illis.</HI> What can be the de&s;ign of your letter but malice, to wake me out of a &s;curvy &s;leep, which however is better
<PB N="34" REF="50">
than none? I am towards nine years older &s;ince I left you, yet that is the lea&s;t of my al|terations; my bu&s;ine&s;s, my diver&s;ions, my con|ver&s;ations, are all entirely changed for the wor&s;e, and &s;o are my &s;tudies and my amu&s;ements in writing; yet, after all, this humdrum way of life might be pa&s;&s;able enough, if you would let me alone. I &s;hall not be able to reli&s;h my wine, my par&s;ons, my hor&s;es, nor my garden for three months, until the &s;pirit you have rai&s;ed &s;hall be di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. I have &s;ometimes won|dered that I have not vi&s;ited you, but I have been &s;topt by too many rea&s;ons, be&s;ides years and lazine&s;s, and yet the&s;e are very good ones. Upon my return after half a year among&s;t you, there would be to me <HI>De&s;iderio nec pudor nec modus.</HI> I was three years reconciling my|&s;elf to the &s;cene, and the bu&s;ine&s;s, to which fortune hath condemned me, and &s;tupidity was what I had recour&s;e to. Be&s;ides, what a figure &s;hould I make in London, while my friends are in poverty, exile, di&s;tre&s;s, or impri&s;onment, and my enemies with rods of iron? Yet I often threaten my&s;elf with the journey, and am every &s;ummer practi&s;ing to get health to bear it: The only inconvenience is, that I grow old in the ex|periment. Although I care not to talk to you as a Divine, yet I hope you have not been author of your colic: do you drink bad wine, or keep
<PB N="35" REF="51">
bad company? Are you not as many years ol|der as I? It will not be always <HI>Et tibi quos mihi demp&s;erit Apponet annos.</HI> I am heartily &s;orry you have any dealings with that ugly di&s;tem|per, and I believe our friend Arbuthnot will recommend you to temperance and exerci&s;e. I wi&s;h they could have as good an effect upon the giddine&s;s I am &s;ubject to, and which this mo|ment I am not free from. I &s;hould have been glad if you had lengthened your letter by tel|ling me the pre&s;ent condition of many of my old acquaintance, Congreve, Arbuthnot, Lewis, &amp;c. but you mention only Mr. Pope, who I believe is lazy, or el&s;e he might have added three lines of his own. I am extremely glad he is not in your ca&s;e of needing great mens fa|vour, and could heartily wi&s;h that you were in his. I have been con&s;idering why Poets have &s;uch ill &s;ucce&s;s in making their Court, &s;ince they are allowed to be the greate&s;t and be&s;t of all flatterers: The defect is, that they flatter only in print or in writing, but not by word of mouth: They will give things under their hand which they make a con&s;cience of &s;peaking. Be&s;ides, they are too libertine to haunt anti|chambers, too poor to bribe Porters and foot|men, and too proud to cringe to &s;econd-hand favourites in a great family. Tell me, are you not under Original &s;in by the dedication of your
<PB N="36" REF="52">
Eclogues to Lord Bolingbroke? I am an ill Judge at this di&s;tance; and be&s;ides, am, for my ea&s;e, utterly ignorant of the commone&s;t things that pa&s;s in the world; but if all Courts have a &s;amene&s;s in them (as the Par&s;ons phra&s;e it) things may be as they were in my time, when all employments went to Parliament-mens Friends, who had been u&s;eful in Elections, and there was always a huge Li&s;t of names in ar|rears at the Trea&s;ury, which would at lea&s;t take up your &s;even years expedient to di&s;charge even one half. I am of opinion, if you will not be offended, that the &s;ure&s;t cour&s;e would be to get your Friend who lodgeth in your hou&s;e to recommend you to the next chief Governor who comes over here for a good civil employ|ment, or to be one of his Secretaries, which your Parliament-men are fond enough of, when there is no room at home. The wine is good and rea&s;onable; you may dine twice a week at the Deanry-hou&s;e; there is a &s;ett of company in this town &s;ufficient for one man; folks will admire you, becau&s;e they have read you, and read of you; and a good employment will make you live tolerably in London, or &s;ump|tuou&s;ly here; or if you divide between both places, it will be for your health.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h I could do more than &s;ay I love you. I left you in a good way both for the late

Court, and the Succe&s;&s;ors; and by the force of too much hone&s;ty or too little &s;ublunary wi&s;|dom, you fell between two &s;tools.

<P>I Find a rebuke in a late Letter of yours, that both &s;tings and plea&s;eth me extremely. Your &s;aying that I ought to have writ a Po&s;t|&s;cript to my friend Gay's, makes me not con|tent to write le&s;s than a whole Letter; and your &s;eeming to take his kindly, gives me hopes you will look upon this as a &s;incere ef|fect of Friend&s;hip. Indeed as I cannot but own the Lazine&s;s with which you tax me, and with which I may equally charge you, for both of us have had (and one of us hath both had and given <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Alluding to his large work on Homer.</NOTE>) a Surfeit of writing; &s;o I

<P>We have never met the&s;e many years with|out mention of you. Be&s;ides my old Acquaint|ance, I have found that all my friends of a later date are &s;uch as were yours before: Lord Oxford, Lord Harcourt, and Lord Harley may look upon me as one entailed upon them by you: Lord Bolingbroke is now returned (as I hope) to take Me with all his other He|reditary Rights: and, indeed, he &s;eems grown &s;o much a Philo&s;opher, as to &s;et his heart up|on &s;ome of them as little, as upon the Poet you gave him. It is &s;ure my ill fate, that all tho&s;e I mo&s;t loved, and with whom I mo&s;t lived, mu&s;t be bani&s;hed: After both of you left Eng|land, my con&s;tant Ho&s;t was the Bi&s;hop of<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Dr Atterbury.</NOTE> Ro|che&s;ter.

<P><PB N="40" REF="56" MS="Y">
The Civilities I have met with from oppo|&s;ite Setts of people, have hinder'd me from be|ing violent or &s;our to any Party; but at the &s;ame time the Ob&s;ervations and Experiences I cannot but have collected, have made me le&s;s fond of, and le&s;s &s;urprized at, any: I am there|fore the more afflicted and the more angry at the Violences and Hard&s;hips I &s;ee practi&s;ed by either. The merry Vein you knew me in, is &s;unk into a Turn of Reflection, that has made the world pretty indifferent to me; and yet I have acquired a Quietne&s;s of mind which by &s;its improves into a certain degree of Chearful|ne&s;s, enough to make me ju&s;t &s;o good humour|ed as to wi&s;h that world well. My Friend|&s;hips are encrea&s;ed by new ones, yet no part of the warmth I felt for the old is dimini&s;hed. Aver&s;ions I have none, but to Knaves (for Fools I have learned to bear with) and &s;uch I cannot be commonly civil to; for I think tho&s;e men are next to Knaves who conver&s;e with them. The greate&s;t Man in power of this &s;ort &s;hall hardly make me bow to him, unle&s;s I had a per&s;onal obligation, and that I will take care not to have. The top plea&s;ure of my life is one I learned from you both how to gain and how to u&s;e; the Freedom of Friend&s;hip with men much my Superiors. To have plea&s;ed great men, according to Horace, is a prai&s;e; but not to
<PB N="41" REF="57" MS="Y">
have flattered them and yet not have di&s;plea&s;ed them, is a greater. I have carefully avoided all Intercour&s;e with Poets and Scriblers, un|le&s;s where by great chance I have found a mo|de&s;t one. By the&s;e means I have had no quar|rels with any per&s;onally; none have been Ene|mies, but who were al&s;o Strangers to me; and as there is no great need of an Eclairci&s;ment with &s;uch, whatever they writ or &s;aid I never retaliated, not only never &s;eeming to know, but often really never knowing, any thing of the matter. There are very few things that give me the Anxiety of a Wi&s;h; the &s;tronge&s;t I have would be to pa&s;s my days with you, and a few &s;uch as you: But Fate has di&s;per&s;ed them all about the world; and I find to wi&s;h it is as vain, as to wi&s;h to &s;ee the Millennium and the Kingdom of the Ju&s;t upon earth.</P>
<P>If I have &s;inned in my long &s;ilence, con&s;ider there is one to whom you your&s;elf have been as great a &s;inner. As &s;oon as you &s;ee his hand, you will learn to do me ju&s;tice, and feel in your heart how long a man may be &s;ilent to tho&s;e he truly loves and re&s;pects.</P>

<P>I Am not &s;o lazy as Pope, and therefore you mu&s;t not expect from me the &s;ame indul|gence to Lazine&s;s; in defending his own cau&s;e he pleads yours, and becomes your Advocate while he appeals to you as his Judge: You will do the &s;ame on your part; and I, and the re&s;t of your common Friends, &s;hall have great ju&s;tice to expect from two &s;uch righteous Tri|bunals: You re&s;emble perfectly the two Ale|hou&s;e-keepers in Holland, who were at the &s;ame time Burgoma&s;ters of the Town, and tax|ed one another's Bills alternately. I declare be|fore-hand I will not &s;tand to the award; my Title to your Friend&s;hip is good, and wants neither Deeds nor Writings to confirm it: but annual Acknowledgments at lea&s;t are nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve it: and I begin to &s;u&s;pect by your defrauding me of them, that you hope in time to di&s;pute it, and to urge Pre&s;cription again&s;t me. I would not &s;ay one word to you about my&s;elf (&s;ince it is a &s;ubject on which you ap|pear to have no curio&s;ity) was it not to try how far the contra&s;t between Pope's fortune and manner of life, and mine, may be carried.</P>

I have been, then, infinitely more uniform and le&s;s di&s;&s;ipated than when you knew me and cared for me. That Love which I u&s;ed to &s;catter with &s;ome profu&s;ion among the female kind, has been the&s;e many years devoted to one object. A great many misfortunes (for &s;o they are called, though &s;ometimes very impro|perly) and a retirement from the world, have made that ju&s;t and nice di&s;crimination between my Acquaintance and my Friends, which we have &s;eldom &s;agacity enough to make for our &s;elves; tho&s;e in&s;ects of various hues, which u&s;ed to hum and buz about me while I &s;tood in the &s;un&s;hine, have di&s;appeared &s;ince I lived in the &s;hade. No man comes to a Hermitage but for the &s;ake of the Hermit; a few philo|&s;ophical Friends come often to mine, and they are &s;uch as you would be glad to live with, if a dull climate and duller company have not al|tered you extremely from what you was nine years ago.</P>
<P>The hoar&s;e voice of Party was never heard in this quiet place; Gazettes and Pamphlets are bani&s;hed from it, and if the Lucubrations of I&s;aac Bicker&s;taff be admitted, this di&s;tinction is owing to &s;ome &s;trokes by which it is judged that this illu&s;trious Philo&s;opher had (like the Indian Fohu, the Grecian Pythagoras, the Per|&s;ian Zoroa&s;ter, and others his Precur&s;ors among
<PB N="44" REF="60">
the Zabians, Magians, and the Egyptian Seers) both his outward and his inward Doctrine, and that he was of no &s;ide at the bottom. When I am there, I forget I ever was of any party my &s;elf; nay, I am often &s;o happily ab&s;orbed by the ab&s;tracted rea&s;on of things, that I am ready to imagine there never was any &s;uch mon&s;ter as Party. Alas, I am &s;oon awakened from that plea&s;ing dream by the Greek and Roman Hi|&s;torians, by Guicciardine, by Machiavel, and Thuanus; for I have vowed to read no Hi&s;tory of our own country, till that body of it which you promi&s;e to fini&s;h, appears <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">See the fir&s;t note on Lett.

<P>I am under no apprehen&s;ion that a glut of Study and Retirement &s;hould ca&s;t me back in|to the hurry of the world; on the contrary, the &s;ingle regret which I ever feel, is that I fell &s;o late into this cour&s;e of life; my Philo&s;ophy grows confirmed by habit, and if you and I meet again, I will extort this approbation, from you: <HI>Jam non con&s;ilio bonus, &s;ed more eo per|ductus, ut non tantum recte facere po&s;&s;im, &s;ed ni&s;i recte facere non po&s;&s;im.</HI> The little incivilities I have met with from oppo&s;ite &s;etts of people, have been &s;o far from rendering me violent or &s;our to any, that I think my &s;elf obliged to them all; &s;ome have cured me of my fears, by &s;hewing me how impotent the malice of the
<PB N="45" REF="61">
world is; others have cured me of my hopes, by &s;hewing how precarious popular friend&s;hips are; all have cured me of &s;urprize: In driving me out of party, they have driven me out of cur&s;ed company; and in &s;tripping me of Titles and Rank, and E&s;tate, and &s;uch trinkets, which every man that will may &s;pare, they have given me that which no man can be happy without.</P>
<P>Reflection and habit have rendered the world &s;o indifferent to me, that I am neither afflicted nor rejoiced, angry nor plea&s;ed at what happens in it, any farther than per&s;onal friend&s;hips intere&s;t me in the affairs of it, and this principle extends my cares but a little way. Perfect Tranquillity is the general tenour of my life: good dige&s;tions, &s;erene weather, and &s;ome other mechanic &s;prings, wind me above it now and then, but I never fall below it; I am &s;ometimes gay, but I am never &s;ad. I have gained new friends, and have lo&s;t &s;ome old ones; my acqui&s;itions of this kind give me a good deal of plea&s;ure, becau&s;e they have not been made lightly: I know no vows &s;o &s;olemn as tho&s;e of friend&s;hip, and therefore a pretty long noviciate of acquaintance &s;hould methinks precede them: My lo&s;&s;es of this kind give me but little trouble, I contributed nothing to them, and a friend who breaks with me un|ju&s;tly, is not worth pre&s;erving. As &s;oon as I
<PB N="46" REF="62">
leave this Town (which will be in a few days) I &s;hall fall back into that cour&s;e of life, which keeps knaves and fools at a great di&s;tance from me: I have an aver&s;ion to them both, but in the ordinary cour&s;e of life I think I can bear the &s;en&s;ible knave better than the fool. One mu&s;t indeed with the former be in &s;ome or other of the attitudes of tho&s;e wooden men whom I have &s;een before a &s;word-cutler's &s;hop in Germany; but even in the&s;e con&s;trained po&s;tures the witty Ra&s;cal will divert me; and he that diverts me does me a great deal of good, and lays me under an obligation to him, which I am not obliged to pay him in another coin: The Fool obliges me to be almo&s;t as much up|on my guard as the knave, and he makes me no amends; he numbs me like the Torpor, or he teazes me like the Fly. This is the Picture of an old Friend, and more like him than that will be which you once a&s;ked, and which he will &s;end you, if you continue &s;till to de&s;ire it.&mdash;Adieu, dear Swift, with all thy faults I love thee intirely; make an effort, and love me on with all mine.</P>

<P>REturning from a &s;ummer expedition of four months on account of my health, I found a letter from you, with an appendix longer than yours from Lord Bolingbroke. I believe there is not a more mi&s;erable malady than an unwillingne&s;s to write letters to our be&s;t friends, and a man might be philo&s;opher enough in finding out rea&s;ons for it. One thing is clear, that it &s;hews a mighty difference betwixt Friend&s;hip and Love, for a lover (as I have heard) is always &s;cribling to his mi&s;tre&s;s. If I could permit my &s;elf to believe what your ci|vility makes you &s;ay, that I am &s;till remem|bered by my friends in England, I am in the right to keep my &s;elf here&mdash;<HI>Non &s;um qualis eram.</HI> I left you in a period of life when one year does more execution than three at yours, to which if you add the dullne&s;s of the air, and of the people, it will make a terrible &s;um. I have no very &s;trong faith in you pretenders to Retirement; you are not of an age for it, nor have gone through either good or bad fortune enough to go into a corner, and form conclu|&s;ions <HI>de contemptu mundi &amp; fuga &s;aeculi,</HI> unle&s;s
<PB N="48" REF="64">
a Poet grows weary of too much applau&s;e, as Mini&s;ters do of too much weight of bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Your happine&s;s is greater than your Merit, in chu&s;ing your Favourites &s;o indifferently among either Party: this you owe partly to your Education, and partly to your Genius employing you in an Art in which Faction has nothing to do, for I &s;uppo&s;e Virgil and Horace are equally read by Whigs and Tories. You have no more to do with the Con&s;titution of Church and State, than a Chri&s;tian at Con&s;tan|tinople; and you are &s;o much the wi&s;er and the happier, becau&s;e both Parties will approve your Poetry as long as you are known to be of neither.</P>
<P>Your notions of Friend&s;hip are new to me <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Yet they are the Chri&s;tian notions.</NOTE>: I believe every man is born with his <HI>quantum,</HI> and he cannot give to one without robbing an|other. I very well know to whom I would give the fir&s;t places in my Friend&s;hip, but they are not in the way: I am condemned to an|other &s;cene, and therefore I di&s;tribute it in Pen|nyworths to tho&s;e about me, and who di&s;plea&s;e me lea&s;t; and &s;hould do the &s;ame to my fel|low pri&s;oners if I were condemned to jayl. I can likewi&s;e tolerate Knaves much better than Fools, becau&s;e their knavery does me no hurt in the commerce I have with them, which
<PB N="49" REF="65">
however I own is more dangerous, tho' not &s;o trouble&s;ome, as that of Fools. I have often endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h a Friend&s;hip among all Men of Genius, and would fain have it done: they are &s;eldom above three or four Contemporaries, and if they could be united, would drive the world before them. I think it was &s;o among the Poets in the time of Au|gu&s;tus: but Envy, and Party, and Pride, have hindered it among us. I do not include the Subalterns, of which you are &s;eldom without a large Tribe. Under the name of Poets and Scriblers I &s;uppo&s;e you mean the Fools you are content to &s;ee &s;ometimes, when they happen to be mode&s;t; which was not frequent among them while I was in the world.</P>
<P>I would de&s;cribe to you my way of living, if any method could be call'd &s;o in this Coun|try. I chu&s;e my companions among tho&s;e of lea&s;t con&s;equence and mo&s;t complyance: I read the mo&s;t trifling Books I can find, and whenever I write, it is upon the mo&s;t trifling &s;ubjects: But riding, walking, and &s;leeping take up eighteen of the twenty-four hours. I procra&s;tinate more than I did twenty years ago, and have &s;everal things to fini&s;h which I put off to twenty years hence; <HI>Haec e&s;t vita Solutorum,</HI> &amp;c.

I like the &s;cheme of our meeting after di&s;tre&s;&s;es and di&s;per&s;ions; but the chief end I propo&s;e to my&s;elf in all my la|bours, is to vex the world, rather than divert it; and if I could compa&s;s that de&s;ign with|out hurting my own per&s;on or fortune, I would be the mo&s;t indefatigable writer you have ever &s;een, without reading.

I have ever hated all Nations, Profe&s;&s;ions, and Commu|nities; and all my love is towards Individuals: for in&s;tance, I hate the Tribe of Lawyers, but I love Coun&s;ellor &s;uch a one, and Judge &s;uch a one: 'Tis &s;o with Phy&s;icians, (I will not &s;peak of my own Trade) Soldiers, Engli&s;h, Scotch, French, and the re&s;t.

But however he is not without fault: There is a pa&s;&s;age in Bede, highly commend|ing the piety and learning of the Iri&s;h in that age, where after abundance of prai&s;es he over|throws them all, by lamenting that, alas! they kept Ea&s;ter at a wrong time of the year.

Our friend Gay is u&s;ed as the friends of Tories are by Whigs (and generally by Tories too.) Becau&s;e he had humour, he was &s;uppo&s;ed to have dealt with Dr. Swift; in like manner as when any one had learning formerly, he was thought to have dealt with the Devil.

<P>I Should &s;ooner have acknowledged yours, if a feveri&s;h di&s;order and the relics of it had not di&s;abled me for a fortnight. I now begin to make excu&s;es, becau&s;e I hope I am pretty near &s;eeing you, and therefore I would culti|vate an acquaintance; becau&s;e if you do not know me when we meet, you need only keep one of my letters, and compare it with my face, for my face and letters are counterparts of my heart. I fear I have not expre&s;s'd that right, but I mean well, and I hate blots: I look in your letter, and in my con&s;cience you &s;ay the &s;ame thing, but in a better manner. Pray tell my Lord Bolingbroke that I wi&s;h he were ba|ni&s;h'd again, for then I &s;hould hear from him, when he was full of philo&s;ophy, and talked <HI>de contemptu mundi.</HI> My Lord Oxford was &s;o ex|tremely kind as to write to me immediately an account of his &s;on's birth; which I immediate|ly acknowledg'd, but before my letter could reach him, I wi&s;h'd it in the &s;ea: I hope I was more afflicted than his Lord&s;hip.

I wi&s;h there were an Ho&s;pital built for its De&s;pi&s;ers, where one might act with &s;afety, and it need not be a large building, only I would have it well en|dow'd. P ** is <HI>fort chancellant</HI> whether he &s;hall turn Par&s;on or no. But all employments here are engaged, or in rever&s;ion. Ca&s;t Wits and ca&s;t Beaux have a proper &s;anctuary in the church: yet we think it a &s;evere judgment, that a fine gentleman, and &s;o much the finer for hating Eccle&s;ia&s;tics, &s;hould be a dome&s;tic humble retainer to an Iri&s;h Prelate.

while in the way to it: otherwi&s;e believe me, every tittle of each is important to me, which &s;ets any one thing before my eyes that happens to you. I writ you a long letter, which I gue&s;s reach'd you the day after your arrival. Since then I had a conference with Sir&mdash;who ex|pre&s;s'd his de&s;ire of having &s;een you again before you left us. He &s;aid he ob&s;erved a willingne&s;s in you to live among us; which I did not deny; but at the &s;ame time told him, you had no &s;uch de&s;ign in your coming this time, which was merely to &s;ee a few of tho&s;e you loved: but that indeed all tho&s;e wi&s;hed it, and particular|ly Lord Peterborow and my&s;elf, who wi&s;hed you lov'd Ireland le&s;s, had you any rea&s;on to love England more. I &s;aid nothing but what I think wou'd induce any man to be as fond of you as I, plain Truth, did they know either it, or you. I can't help thinking (when I con&s;ider the whole &s;hort Li&s;t of our friends) that none of 'em except you and I are quali|fy'd for the Mountains of Wales. The Dr. goes to Cards, Gay to Court; one lo&s;es mo|ney, one lo&s;es his time: Another of our friends labours to be unambitious, but he labours in an unwilling &s;oil. One Lady you like has too much of France to be fit for Wales: Another is too much a &s;ubject to Princes and Potentates, to reli&s;h $span$ Ta&s;te of liberty and poverty.

Mr. Congreve is too &s;ick to bear a thin air; and &s;he that leads him too rich to enjoy any thing. Lord Peterborow can go to any climate, but never &s;tay in any.

Mr. Bethel indeed is too good and too hone&s;t to live in the world, but yet 'tis fit, for its example, he &s;hould.

I &s;ee no &s;un&s;hine but in the face of a friend.</P>
<P>I had a glymp&s;e of a letter of yours lately, by which I find you are (like the vulgar) apter to think well of people out of power, than of people in power; perhaps 'tis a mi&s;take, but however there's &s;omething in it generous.

<P>ABout ten days ago a Book was publi&s;h'd here of the Travels of one Gulliver, which hath been the conver&s;ation of the whole town ever &s;ince: The whole impre&s;&s;ion &s;old in a week; and nothing is more diverting than to hear the different opinions people give of it, though all agree in liking it extremely. 'Tis generally &s;aid that you are the Author; but I am told, the Book&s;eller declares, he knows not from what hand it came. From the highe&s;t
<PB N="76" REF="94">
to the lowe&s;t it is univer&s;ally read, from the Cabinet-council to the Nur&s;ery. The Politi|cians to a man agree, that it is free from par|ticular reflections, but that the Satire on gene|ral &s;ocieties of men is too &s;evere. Not but we now and then meet with people of greater per|&s;picuity, who are in &s;earch for particular appli|cations in every leaf; and 'tis highly probable we &s;hall have keys publi&s;h'd to give light into Gulliver's de&s;ign. Lord&mdash;is the per&s;on who lea&s;t approves it, blaming it as a de&s;ign of evil con&s;equence to depreciate human nature, at which it cannot be wondered that he takes mo&s;t offence, being him&s;elf the mo&s;t accom|pli&s;h'd of his &s;pecies, and &s;o lo&s;ing more than any other of that prai&s;e which is due both to the dignity and virtue of a man <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">It is no wonder a man of worth &s;hould <HI>condemn</HI> a &s;atire on his &s;pecies; as it injures Virtue and violates Truth: And, as little, that a very corrupt reader &s;hould <HI>approve</HI> it, becau&s;e it ju&s;ti|fies his principles and tends to excu&s;e his practice.</NOTE>. Your friend, my Lord Harcourt, commends it very much, though he thinks in &s;ome places the matter too far carried. The Duche&s;s Dowager of Marl|borough is in raptures at it; &s;he &s;ays &s;he can dream of nothing el&s;e &s;ince &s;he read it: &s;he de|clares, that &s;he hath now found out, that her whole life hath been lo&s;t in care&s;&s;ing the wor&s;t part of mankind, and treating the be&s;t as her
<PB N="77" REF="95">
foes; and that if &s;he knew Gulliver, tho' he had been the wor&s;t enemy &s;he ever had, &s;he would give up her pre&s;ent acquaintance for his friend&s;hip. You may &s;ee by this, that you are not much injur'd by being &s;uppos'd the Au|thor of this piece. If you are, you have di&s;|oblig'd us, and two or three of your be&s;t friends, in not giving us the lea&s;t hint of it while you were with us; and in particular Dr. Arbuthnot, who &s;ays it is ten thou&s;and pitys he had not known it, he could have added &s;uch abundance of things upon every &s;ubject. A|mong Lady-critics, &s;ome have found out that Mr. Gulliver had a particular malice to Maids of honour. Tho&s;e of them who frequent the Church, &s;ay, his de&s;ign is impious, and that it is depreciating the works of the Creator. Not|with&s;tanding, I am told the Prince&s;s hath read it with great plea&s;ure. As to other Critics, they think the flying i&s;land is the lea&s;t enter|taining; and &s;o great an opinion the town have of the impo&s;&s;ibility of Gulliver's writing at all below him&s;elf, 'tis agreed that part was not writ by the &s;ame hand, tho' this hath its defenders too. It hath pa&s;s'd Lords and Com|mons, <HI>nemine contradicente;</HI> and the whole town, men, women, and children are quite full of it.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="96">
Perhaps I may all this time be talking to you of a Book you have never &s;een, and which hath not yet reach'd Ireland; if it hath not, I believe what we have &s;aid will be &s;ufficient to recommend it to your reading, and that you will order me to &s;end it to you.</P>
<P>But it will be much better to come over your &s;elf, and read it here, where you will have the plea&s;ure of variety of commentators, to explain the difficult pa&s;&s;ages to you.</P>
<P>We all rejoice that you have fix'd the pre|ci&s;e time of your coming to be <HI>cum hirundine prima;</HI> which we modern naturali&s;ts pro|nounce, ought to be reckon'd, contrary to Pliny, in this northern latitude of fifty-two de|grees, from the end of February, Styl. Greg. at farthe&s;t. But to us your friends, the coming of &s;uch a black &s;wallow as you, will make a &s;ummer in the wor&s;t of &s;ea&s;ons. We are no le&s;s glad at your mention of Twickenham and Dawley; and in town you know you have a lodging at Court.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s is cloath'd in Iri&s;h &s;ilk; pray give our &s;ervice to the Weavers. We are &s;trangely &s;urpriz'd to hear that the Bells in Ire|land ring without your money. I hope you do not write the thing that is not. We are afraid that B&mdash;hath been guilty of that crime, that you (like Honynhnm) have treated him as a
<PB N="79" REF="97">
Yahoo, and di&s;carded him your &s;ervice. I fear you do not under&s;tand the&s;e modi&s;h terms, which every creature now under&s;tands but your &s;elf.</P>
<P>You tell us your Wine is bad, and that the Clergy do not frequent your hou&s;e, which we look upon to be tautology. The be&s;t advice we can give you is, to make them a pre&s;ent of Your wine, and come away to better.</P>

<P>I Have re&s;olved to take time; and in &s;pite of all misfortunes and demurs, which &s;ickne&s;s, lamene&s;s, or di&s;ability of any kind can throw in my way, to write you (at intervals) a long letter. My two lea&s;t fingers of one hand hang impediments to the others <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This was occa&s;ioned by a bad accident as he was re|turning home in a friends Chariot; which in pa&s;&s;ing a bridge was overturned, and thrown with the hor&s;es into the River.

who only take up room, and never are active or a&s;&s;i&s;tant to our wants: I &s;hall never be much the better for 'em&mdash;I congratulate you fir&s;t upon what you call your Cou&s;in's wonder|ful Book, which is <HI>publica trita manu</HI> at pre|&s;ent, and I prophe&s;y will be hereafter the ad|miration of all men. That countenance with which it is received by &s;ome &s;tate&s;men, is de|lightful; I wi&s;h I could tell you how every &s;ingle man looks upon it, to ob&s;erve which has been my whole diver&s;ion this fortnight. I've never been a night in London &s;ince you left me, till now for this very end, and indeed it has fully an&s;wered my expectations.</P>
<P>I find no con&s;iderable man very angry at the book: &s;ome indeed think it rather too bold, and too general a Satire: but none, that I hear of, accu&s;e it of particular reflections (I mean no per&s;ons of con&s;equence, or good judgment; the mob of Critics, you know, always are de|&s;irous to apply Satire to tho&s;e they envy for be|ing above them) &s;o that you needed not to have been &s;o &s;ecret upon this head. Motte re|ceiv'd the copy (he tells me) he knew not from whence, nor from whom, dropp'd at his hou&s;e in the dark, from a Hackney-coach: by com|puting the time, I found it was after you left England, &s;o, for my part, I &s;u&s;pend my judg|ment.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="99">
I am pleas'd with the nature and quality of your Pre&s;ent to the Prince&s;s. The Iri&s;h &s;tuff you &s;ent to Mrs. H. her R. H. laid hold of, and has made up for her own u&s;e. Are you de|termin'd to be National in every thing, even in your civilities? you are the greate&s;t Politician in Europe at this rate; but as you are a ratio|nal Politician, there's no great fear of you, you will never &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>Another thing, in which you have plea&s;ed me, was what you &s;ay to Mr. P. by which it &s;eems to me that you value no man's civility above your own dignity, or your own rea&s;on. Surely, without flattery, you are now above all parties of men, and it is high time to be &s;o, after twenty or thirty years ob&s;ervation of the great world.</P>
<P><Q><L>Nullius addictus jurare in verba magi&s;tri.</L></Q>
I que&s;tion not, many men would be of your intimacy, that you might be of their intere&s;t: But God forbid an hone&s;t or witty man &s;hould be of any, but that of his country. They have &s;croundrels enough to write for their pa&s;&s;ions and their de&s;igns; let us write for truth, for honour, and for po&s;terity. If you mu&s;t needs write about Politics at all (but perhaps 'tis full as wi&s;e to play the fool any other way) &s;ure|ly it ought to be &s;o as to pre&s;erve the dignity
<PB N="82" REF="100">
and integrity of your character with tho&s;e times to come, which will mo&s;t impartially judge of you.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h you had writ to Lord Peterborow, no man is more affectionate toward you. Don't fancy none but Tories are your friends; for at that rate I mu&s;t be, at mo&s;t, but half your friend, and &s;incerely I am wholly &s;o. Adieu, write often, and come &s;oon, for many wi&s;h you well, and all would be glad of your company.</P>

<P>I Am ju&s;t come from an&s;wering a Letter of Mrs. H&mdash;'s writ in &s;uch my&s;tical terms, that I &s;hould never have found out the mean|ing, if a Book had not been &s;ent me called <HI>Gulliver's Travels,</HI> of which you &s;ay &s;o much in yours. I read the Book over, and in the &s;e|cond volume ob&s;erve &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages, which appear to be patch'd and altered <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This was the fact, which is complained of and redre&s;|&s;ed in the Dublin Edition of the Dean's works.</NOTE>, and the &s;tyle of a different &s;ort (unle&s;s I am much mi&s;|taken)

Dr. Arbuthnot likes the Projectors lea&s;t <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Becau&s;e he under&s;tood it to be intended as a &s;atire on the <HI>Royal Society.</HI></NOTE>; others, you tell me, the Flying i&s;land; &s;ome think it wrong to be &s;o hard upon whole Bo|dies or Corporations, yet the general opinion is, that reflections on particular per&s;ons are mo&s;t to be blam'd: &s;o that in the&s;e ca&s;es, I think the be&s;t method is to let cen&s;ure and opinion take their cour&s;e. A Bi&s;hop here &s;aid, that book was full of improbable lies, and for his part, he hardly believed a word of it; and &s;o much for Gulliver.</P>
<P>Going to England is a very good thing, if it were not attended with an ugly circum&s;tance of returning to Ireland. It is a &s;hame you do not per&s;uade your Mini&s;ters to keep me on that &s;ide, if it were but by a court expedient of keeping me in pri&s;on for a Plotter; but at the &s;ame time I mu&s;t tell you, that &s;uch journeys very much &s;horten my life, for a month here is longer than &s;ix at Twickenham.</P>
<P>How comes friend Gay to be &s;o tedious? another man can publi&s;h fifty-thou&s;and Lies &s;ooner than he can fifty Fables.</P>
<P>I am ju&s;t going to perform a very good of|fice, it is to a&s;&s;i&s;t with the Archbi&s;hop, in de|grading a Par&s;on who couples all our beggars, by which I &s;hall make one happy man: and

<P>I am come back, and have deprived the par|&s;on, who by a law here is to be hanged the next couple he marries: he declared to us that he re&s;olved to be hanged, only de&s;ired that when he was to go to the gallows, the Archbi&s;hop would take off his Excommunication. Is not he a good Catholic? and yet he is but a Scotch-man. This is the only Iri&s;h event I ever troubled you with, and I think it de&s;erves notice&mdash;Let me add, that, if I were Gulliver's friend, I would de&s;ire all my acquaintance to give out that his copy was ba&s;ely mangled, and abu&s;ed, and added to, and blotted out by the Printer; for &s;o to me it &s;eems, in the &s;econd volume particularly.</P>

<P>I am very much pleas'd that you approve what was &s;ent, becau&s;e I remember to have heard a great man &s;ay, that nothing required more judgment than making a pre&s;ent; which when it is done to tho&s;e of high rank, ought to be of &s;omething that is not readily got for money. You oblige me, and at the &s;ame time do me ju&s;tice in what you ob&s;erve as to Mr. P.

I have &s;ome few of tho&s;e things I call Thoughts moral and diverting; if you plea&s;e, I will &s;end the be&s;t I can pick from them, to add to the new volume.

<P>Our Mi&s;cellany is now quite printed. I am prodigiou&s;ly pleas'd with this joint-volume, in which methinks we look like friends, &s;ide by &s;ide, &s;erious and merry by turns, conver&s;ing in|terchangeably, and walking down hand in hand to po&s;terity; not in the &s;tiff forms of learned Authors, flattering each other, and &s;etting the re&s;t of mankind at nought: but in a free, un|important, natural, ea&s;y manner; diverting o|thers ju&s;t as we diverted our&s;elves. The third volume con&s;i&s;ts of Ver&s;es, but I would chu&s;e to print none but &s;uch as have &s;ome peculiarity, and may be di&s;tingui&s;h'd for ours, from other writers.

<P>You receiv'd, I hope, &s;ome commendatory ver&s;es from a Hor&s;e and a Lillipputian, to Gulliver; and an heroic Epi&s;tle of Mrs. Gul|liver. The Book&s;eller would fain have print|ed 'em before the &s;econd Edition of the Book, but I would not permit it without your ap|probation: nor do I much like them. You &s;ee how much like a Poet I write, and yet if you were with us, you'd be deep in Politics. People are very warm, and very angry, very little to the purpo&s;e, but therefore the more warm and the more angry: <HI>Non no&s;trum e&s;t, Tantas componere lites.</HI> I &s;tay at Twitnam, without &s;o much as reading news-papers, votes, or any other paltry Pamphlets: Mr. Stopford will carry you a whole parcel of them, which are &s;ent for your diver&s;ion, but not imitation. For my own part, methinks I am at Glubdub|drib with none but ancients and &s;pirits about me.</P>
<P>I am rather better than I u&s;e to be at this &s;ea&s;on, but my hand (tho', as you &s;ee, it has not lo&s;t its cunning) is frequently in very aukward

<P>Lady Bolingbroke has writ you a long, lively letter, which will attend this; She has very bad health, he very good. Lord Peterborow has writ twice to you; we fancy &s;ome letters have been intercepted, or lo&s;t by accident. About ten thou&s;and things I want to tell you: I wi&s;h you were as impatient to hear them, for if &s;o, you would, you mu&s;t come early this &s;pring. Adieu. Let me have a line from you.

I would very fain know, as &s;oon as you recover your complaints, or any part of them. Would to God I could ea&s;e any of them, or had been able even to have alleviated any!

I can't explain my meaning, perhaps you know it: But the be&s;t way of con|vincing you of my indulgence, will be, if I live, to vi&s;it you in Ireland, and act there as much in my own way as you did here in yours. I will not leave your roof, if I am ill.

We are to believe, we &s;hall have &s;omething better than even a friend, there, but certainly here we have nothing &s;o good.

no where to retire. I therefore thought it be&s;t to return to Ireland, rather than go to any di|&s;tant place in England. Here is my maintain|ance, and here my convenience. If it plea&s;es God to re&s;tore me to my health, I &s;hall readi|ly make a third journey; if not, we mu&s;t part as all human creatures have parted. You are the be&s;t and kinde&s;t friend in the world, and I know no-body alive or dead to whom I am &s;o much obliged; and if ever you made me an|gry, it was for your too much care about me. I have often wi&s;h'd that God almighty would be &s;o ea&s;y to the weakne&s;s of mankind, as to let old friends be acquainted in another &s;tate; and if I were to write an Utopia for heaven, that would be one of my &s;chemes.

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>October 30, 1727.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE fir&s;t letter I writ after my landing was to Mr. Gay; but it would have been wi&s;er to direct it to Ton&s;on or Lintot, to whom I believe his lodgings are better known than to the runners of the Po&s;t-office. In that Letter you will find what a quick change I made in &s;even days from London to the Deanery, thro' many nations and languages unknown to the civilized world. And I have often reflected in how few hours, with a &s;wift hor&s;e or a &s;trong gale, a man may come among a people as un|known to him as the Antipodes. If I did not know you more by your conver&s;ation and kind|ne&s;s
<PB N="95" REF="113">
than by your letter, I might be ba&s;e enough to &s;u&s;pect, that in point of friend&s;hip you act|ed like &s;ome Philo&s;ophers who writ much bet|ter upon Virtue than they practi&s;ed it. In an|&s;wer, I can only &s;wear that you have taught me to dream, which I had not done in twelve years further than by inexpre&s;&s;ible non&s;en&s;e; but now I can every night di&s;tinctly &s;ee Twickenham, and the Grotto, and Dawley, and many other et cetera's, and it is but three nights &s;ince I beat Mrs. Pope. I mu&s;t needs confe&s;s, that the plea&s;ure I take in thinking on you is very much le&s;&s;ened by the pain I am in about your health: You pay dearly for the great talents God hath given you; and for the con&s;equences of them in the e&s;teem and di&s;tinction you re|ceive from mankind, unle&s;s you can provide a tolerable &s;tock of health; in which pur&s;uit I cannot much commend your conduct, but ra|ther entreat you would mend it by following the advice of my Lord Bolingbroke and your other Phy&s;icians. When you talk'd of Cups and Impre&s;&s;ions, it came into my head to imi|tate you in quoting Scripture, not to your ad|vantage; I mean what was &s;aid to David by one of his brothers: <Q>&startq;I knew thy pride and the naughtine&s;s of thy heart;&endq;</Q> I remember when it grieved your &s;oul to &s;ee me pay a pen|ny more than my club at an inn, when you
<PB N="96" REF="114">
had maintained me three months at bed and board; for which if I had dealt with you in the Smithfield way it would have co&s;t me a hundred pounds, for I live wor&s;e here upon more. Did you ever con&s;ider that I am for life almo&s;t twice as rich as you, and pay no rent, and drink French wine twice as cheap as you do Port, and have neither Coach, Chair, nor mother? As to the world, I think you ought to &s;ay to it with St. Paul, <HI>If we have &s;own unto you &s;piritual things, is it a great thing if we &s;hall reap your carnal things?</HI> This is more proper &s;till, if you con&s;ider the French word <HI>&s;piritual,</HI> in which &s;en&s;e the world ought to pay you better than they do. If you made me a pre&s;ent of a thou&s;and pound, I would not al|low my&s;elf to be in your debt; and if I made you a pre&s;ent of two, I would not allow my|&s;elf to be out of it. But I have not half your pride: witne&s;s what Mr. Gay &s;ays in his letter, that I was cen&s;ured for begging Pre&s;ents, tho' I limited them to ten &s;hillings. I &s;ee no rea&s;on, (at lea&s;t my friend&s;hip and vanity &s;ee none) why you &s;hould not give me a vi&s;it, when you &s;hall happen to be di&s;engaged: I will &s;end a per&s;on to Che&s;ter to take care of you, and you &s;hall be u&s;ed by the be&s;t folks we have here, as well as civility and good-nature can contrive; I be|lieve local motion will be no ill phy&s;ic, and I
<PB N="97" REF="115">
will have your coming in&s;cribed on my Tomb, and recorded in never-dying ver&s;e.</P>
<P>I thank Mrs. Pope for her prayers, but I know the my&s;tery. A per&s;on of my acquaint|ance, who u&s;ed to corre&s;pond with the la&s;t Great Duke of Tu&s;cany, &s;hewing one of the Duke's letters to a friend, and profe&s;&s;ing great &s;en&s;e of his Highne&s;s's friend&s;hip, read this pa&s;&s;age out of the letters, <HI>I would give one of my fingers to procure your real good.</HI> The Per&s;on to whom this was read, and who knew the Duke well, &s;aid, the meaning of <HI>real good</HI> was only that the other might turn a good Catholic. Pray a&s;k Mrs. Pope whether this &s;tory is applicable to her and me? I pray God ble&s;s her, for I am &s;ure &s;he is a good Chri&s;tian, and (which is al|mo&s;t as rare) a good Woman.</P>

<P>THE Queen's family is at la&s;t &s;ettled, and in the li&s;t I was appointed Gentleman|u&s;her to the Prince&s;s Loui&s;a, the younge&s;t Prince&s;s; which, upon account that I am &s;o far advanced in life, I have declin'd accepting;

<P>I Entirely approve your refu&s;al of that em|ployment, and your writing to the Queen. I am perfectly confident you have a keen enemy in the Mini&s;try. God forgive him, but not till he puts him&s;elf in a &s;tate to be forgiven. Upon rea&s;oning with my&s;elf, I &s;hould hope they are gone too far to di&s;card you quite, and that they will give you &s;omething; which, al|though much le&s;s than they ought, will be (as far as it is worth) better circum&s;tantiated: And &s;ince you already ju&s;t live, a middling help will make you ju&s;t tolerable. Your latene&s;s in life (as you &s;o &s;oon call it) might be improper to be|gin the world with, but almo&s;t the elde&s;t men

may hope to &s;ee changes in a Court. A Mi|ni&s;ter is always &s;eventy: You are thirty years younger; and con&s;ider, Cromwel him&s;elf did not begin to appear till he was older than you. I beg you will be thrifty, and learn to value a &s;hilling, which Dr. Birch &s;aid was a &s;erious thing. Get a &s;tronger fence about your 1000<HI>l.</HI> and throw the inner fence into the heap, and be advi&s;ed by your Twickenham landlord and me about an annuity. You are the mo&s;t re|fractory, hone&s;t, good-natur'd man I ever have known; I could argue out this paper&mdash;I am very glad your Opera is fini&s;hed, and hope your friends will join the readier to make it &s;ucceed, becau&s;e you are ill-u&s;ed by others.</P>
<P>I have known Courts the&s;e thirty-&s;ix years, and know they differ; but in &s;ome things they are extremely con&s;tant: Fir&s;t, in the trite old maxim of a Mini&s;ter's never forgiving tho&s;e he hath injured; Secondly, in the in&s;incerity of tho&s;e who would be thought the be&s;t friends: Thirdly, in the love of fawning, cringing, and tale-bearing: Fourthly, in &s;a|crificing tho&s;e whom we really wi&s;h well, to a point of intere&s;t, or intrigue: Fifthly, in keep|ing every thing worth taking, for tho&s;e who can do &s;ervice or di&s;-&s;ervice.</P>
<P>Now why does not Pope publi&s;h his dul|ne&s;s? the rogues he marks will die of them|&s;elves

in peace, and &s;o will his friends, and &s;o there will be neither puni&s;hment, nor reward.&mdash;Pray enquire how my Lord St. John does? there's no man's health in England I am more concerned about than his.&mdash;I wonder whether you begin to ta&s;te the plea&s;ure of Indepen|dency? or whether you do not &s;ometimes leer upon the Court, <HI>oculo retorto?</HI> Will you not think of an Annuity, when you are two years older, and have doubled your purcha&s;e-money? Have you dedicated your Opera, and got the u&s;ual dedication-fee of twenty guineas? How is the Doctor? does he not chide that you ne|ver called upon him for hints? Is my Lord Bo|lingbroke at the moment I am writing, a planter, a philo&s;opher, or a writer? Is Mr. Pultney in expectation of a &s;on, or my Lord Oxford of a new old Manu&s;cript?</P>
<P>I bought your Opera to-day for &s;ixpence, a cur&s;ed print. I find there is neither dedication nor preface, both which wants I approve; it is in the <HI>grand gout.</HI></P>
<P>We are as full of it <HI>pro modulo no&s;tro</HI> as Lon|don can be; continually acting, and hou&s;es cramm'd, and the Lord Lieutenant &s;everal times there laughing his heart out. I did not under&s;tand that the &s;cene of Locket and Peachum's quarrel was an imitation of one between Brutus and Ca&s;&s;ius, till I was told it.

I wi&s;h Mackheath, when he was going to be hang'd, had imitated Alexander the great when he was dying: I would have had his fellow|rogues de&s;ire his commands about a Succe&s;&s;or, and he to an&s;wer, Let it be the mo&s;t worthy, &amp;c. We hear a million of &s;tories about the Opera, of the applau&s;e at the &s;ong, <HI>That was level'd at me,</HI> when two great Mini&s;ters were in a box together, and all the world &s;taring at them. I am heartily glad your Opera hath mended your pur&s;e, though perhaps it may &s;poil your court.</P>
<P>Will you de&s;ire my Lord Bolingbroke, Mr. Pultney, and Mr. Pope, to command you to buy an annuity with two thou&s;and pounds? that you may laugh at courts, and bid Mini|&s;ters&mdash;</P>
<P>Ever pre&s;erve &s;ome &s;pice of the Alderman, and prepare again&s;t Age and Dulne&s;s, and Sick|ne&s;s, and Coldne&s;s or Death of Friends. A Whore has a re&s;ource left, that &s;he can turn bawd; but an old decay'd Poet is a creature abandon'd, and at mercy, when he can find none. Get me likewi&s;e Polly's Me&s;&s;o-tinto. Lord, how the &s;chool-boys at We&s;tmin&s;ter, and Univer&s;ity-lads adore you at this juncture! Have you made as many men laugh, as Mini|&s;ters can make weep?</P>

<P>I Have with great plea&s;ure &s;hewn the New-England News-paper with the two names Jonathan Gulliver, and I remember Mr. For|te&s;cue &s;ent you an account from the a&s;&s;izes, of one Lemuel Gulliver who had a Cau&s;e there, and lo&s;t it on his ill reputation of being a liar. The&s;e are not the only ob&s;ervations I have made upon odd &s;trange accidents in trifles, which in things of great importance would have been matter for Hi&s;torians. Mr. Gay's Opera hath been acted here twenty times, and my Lord Lieutenant tells me, it is very well per|form'd; he hath &s;een it often, and approves it much.</P>
<P>You give a mo&s;t melancholy account of your&s;elf, and which I do not approve. I reckon
<PB N="111" REF="129">
that a man &s;ubject like us to bodily infir|mities, &s;hould only occa&s;ionally conver&s;e with great people, notwith&s;tanding all their good qualities, ea&s;ine&s;&s;es, and kindne&s;&s;es. There is another race which I prefer before them, as Beef and Mutton for con&s;tant diet before Par|tridges: I mean a middle kind both for under|&s;tanding and fortune, who are perfectly ea&s;y, never impertinent, complying in every thing, ready to do a hundred little offices that you and I may often want, who dine and &s;it with me five times for once that I go to them, and whom I can tell without offence, that I am otherwi&s;e engaged at pre&s;ent. This you can|not expect from any of tho&s;e that either you or I or both are acquainted with on your &s;ide; who are only fit for our healthy &s;ea&s;ons, and have much bu&s;ine&s;s of their own. God forbid I &s;hould condemn you to Ireland <HI>(Quanquam O!)</HI> and for England I de&s;pair; and indeed a change of affairs would come too late at my &s;ea&s;on of life, and might probably produce nothing on my behalf. You have kept Mrs. Pope longer, and have had her care beyond what from na|ture you could expect; not but her lo&s;s will be very &s;en&s;ible, whenever it &s;hall happen. I &s;ay one thing, that both &s;ummers and winters are milder here than with you; all things for life in general better for a middling fortune: you
<PB N="112" REF="130">
will have an ab&s;olute command of your com|pany, with whatever ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s or freedom you may expect or allow. I have an elderly hou&s;e-keeper, who hath been my <HI>W-lp-le</HI> above thirty years, whenever I liv'd in this kingdom. I have the command of one or two villa's near this town: You have a warm apartment in this hou&s;e, and two gardens for amu&s;ement. I have &s;aid enough, yet not half. Except ab&s;ence from friends, I confe&s;s freely that I have no di&s;content at living here; be&s;ides what ari&s;es from a &s;illy &s;pirit of Liberty, which as it nei|ther &s;ours my drink, nor hurts my meat, nor &s;poils my &s;tomach farther than in imagination, &s;o I re&s;olve to throw it off.</P>
<P>You talk of this Dunciad, but I am impa|tient to have it <HI>volare per ora</HI>&mdash;there is now a vacancy for fame; the Beggar's Opera hath done its ta&s;k, <HI>di&s;cedat uti conviva &s;atur.</HI></P>

<P>I Look upon my Lord Bolingbroke and us two, as a peculiar Triumvirate, who have
<PB N="113" REF="131">
nothing to expect, or to fear; and &s;o far fitte&s;t to conver&s;e with one another: Only he and I are a little &s;ubject to &s;chemes, and one of us (I won't &s;ay which) upon very weak appear|ances, and this you have nothing to do with. I do profe&s;s without affectation, that your kind opinion of me as a Patriot (&s;ince you call it &s;o) is what I do not de&s;erve; becau&s;e what I do is owing to perfect rage and re&s;entment, and the mortifying &s;ight of &s;lavery, folly, and ba&s;ene&s;s about me, among which I'm forc'd to live. And I will take my oath that you have more Virtue in an hour, than I in &s;even years; for you de&s;pi&s;e the follies, and hate the vices of mankind, without the lea&s;t ill effect on your temper; and with regard to particular men, you are inclined always rather to think the bet|ter, whereas with me it is always directly con|trary. I hope however, this is not in you from a &s;uperior principle of virtue, but from your &s;ituation, which hath made all parties and in|tere&s;ts indifferent to you, who can be under no concern about high and low-church, Whig and Tory, or who is fir&s;t Mini&s;ter&mdash;Your long let|ter was the la&s;t I receiv'd till this by Dr. Delany, although you mention another &s;ince. The Dr. told me your &s;ecret about the Dunciad, which does not plea&s;e me, becau&s;e it defers gratifying my vanity in the mo&s;t tender point, and per|haps
<PB N="114" REF="132">
may wholly di&s;appoint it. As to one of your enquiries, I am ea&s;y enough in great mat|ters, and have a thou&s;and paltry vexations in my little &s;tation, and the more contemptible, the more vexatious. There might be a Lutrin writ upon the tricks u&s;ed by my Chapter to teize me. I do not conver&s;e with one creature of Station or Title, but I have a &s;ett of ea&s;y people whom I entertain when I have a mind; I have formerly de&s;crib'd them to you, but, when you come, you &s;hall have the honours of the country as much as you plea&s;e, and I &s;hall on that account make a better figure, as long as I live. Pray God pre&s;erve Mrs. Pope for your &s;ake and ea&s;e, I love and e&s;teem her too much to wi&s;h it for her own: If I were five and twenty, I would wi&s;h to be of her age, to be as &s;ecure as &s;he is of a better life. Mrs. P. B. has writ to me, and is one of the be&s;t Letter-writers I know; very good &s;en&s;e, civi|lity and friend&s;hip, without any &s;tiffne&s;s or con|&s;traint. The Dunciad has taken wind here, but if it had not, you are as much known here as in England, and the Univer&s;ity-lads will crowd to ki&s;s the hem of your garment. I am griev'd to hear that my Lord Bolingbroke's ill health forc'd him to the Bath. Tell me, is not Temperance a nece&s;&s;ary virtue for great men, &s;ince it is the parent of Ea&s;e and Liberty?
<PB N="115" REF="133">
&s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the u&s;e and improvement of the mind, and which Philo&s;ophy allows to be the greate&s;t felicities of life? I believe, had health been given &s;o liberally to you, it would have been better hu&s;banded without &s;hame to your parts.</P>

<P>I Now hold the pen for my Lord Bolingbroke, who is reading your letter between two Hay|cocks; but his attention is &s;omewhat diverted by ca&s;ting his eyes on the clouds, not in admi|ration of what you &s;ay, but for fear of a &s;hower. He is pleas'd with your placing him in the Triumvirate between your&s;elf and me; tho' he &s;ays that he doubts he &s;hall fare like Lepidus, while one of us runs away with all the power like Augu&s;tus, and another with all the plea|&s;ures like Anthony. It is upon a fore&s;ight of this, that he has fitted up his farm, and you will agree, that this &s;cheme of retreat at lea&s;t is not founded upon weak appearances. Upon his return from the Bath, all peccant humours, he finds, are purg'd out of him; and his great Temperance and Oeconomy are &s;o &s;ignal, that the fir&s;t is fit for my con&s;titution, and the lat|ter
<PB N="116" REF="134">
would enable you to lay up &s;o much mo|ney as to buy a Bi&s;hoprick in England. As to the return of his health and vigour, were you here, you might enquire of his Hay-makers; but as to his temperance, I can an&s;wer that (for one whole day) we have had nothing for dinner but mutton-broth, beans and bacon, and a Barn-door fowl.</P>
<P>Now his Lord&s;hip is run after his Cart, I have a moment left to my&s;elf to tell you, that I over-heard him ye&s;terday agree with a Pain|ter for 200 <HI>l.</HI> to paint his country-hall with Trophies of Rakes, &s;pades, prongs, &amp;c. and other ornaments merely to countenance his cal|ling this place a Farm&mdash;now turn over a new leaf&mdash;</P>
<P>He bids me a&s;&s;ure you, he &s;hould be &s;orry not to have more &s;chemes of kindne&s;s for his friends, than of ambition for him&s;elf: There, tho' his &s;chemes may be weak, the motives at lea&s;t are &s;trong; and he &s;ays further, if you could bear as great a fall, and decrea&s;e of your revenues, as he knows by experience he can, you wou'd not live in Ireland an hour.</P>
<P>The Dunciad is going to be printed in all pomp, with the in&s;cription, which makes me proude&s;t. It will be attended with <HI>Proeme, Prolegomena, Te&s;timonia Scriptorum, Index Au|thorum,</HI> and Notes <HI>Variorum.</HI> As to the latter,

<P>I Have often run over the <HI>Dunciad</HI> in an Iri&s;h edition (I &s;uppo&s;e full of faults) which a gentleman &s;ent me. The notes I could wi&s;h to be very large, in what relates to the per&s;ons concern'd; for I have long ob&s;erv'd that twen|ty miles from London no-body under&s;tands hints, initial letters, or town-facts and pa&s;|&s;ages; and in a few years not even tho&s;e who
<PB N="118" REF="136">
live in London. I would have the names of tho&s;e &s;criblers printed indexically at the begin|ning or end of the Poem, with an account of their works, for the reader to refer to. I would have all the Parodies (as they are call'd) re|ferred to the author they imitate&mdash;When I be|gan this long paper, I thought I &s;hould have fill'd it with &s;etting down the &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages I had mark'd in the edition I had; but I find it unnece&s;&s;ary, &s;o many of them falling under the &s;ame rule. After twenty times reading the whole, I never in my opinion &s;aw &s;o much good &s;atire, or more good &s;en&s;e, in &s;o many lines. How it pa&s;&s;es in Dublin I know not yet; but I am &s;ure it will be a great di&s;advantage to the poem, that the per&s;ons and facts will not be under&s;tood, till an explanation comes out, and a very full one. I imagine it is not to be pub|li&s;hed till towards winter, when folks begin to gather in town. Again I in&s;i&s;t, you mu&s;t have your A&s;teri&s;ks fill'd up with &s;ome real names of real Dunces.</P>
<P>I am now reading your preceding letter, of June 28, and find that all I have advis'd above is mention'd there. I would be glad to know whether the quarto edition is to come out ano|nymou&s;ly, as publi&s;hed by the Commentator, with all his pomp of pre&s;aces, &amp;c. and among many complaints of &s;purious editions? I am
<PB N="119" REF="137">
thinking whether the Editor &s;hould not follow the old &s;tyle of, This excellent author, &amp;c. and refine in many places when you meant no refinement; and into the bargain take all the load of naming the dunces, their qualities, hi&s;|tories, and performances?</P>
<P>As to your &s;elf, I doubt you want a &s;purrer|on to exerci&s;e and to amu&s;ements; but to talk of decay at your &s;ea&s;on of life is a je&s;t. But you are not &s;o regular as I. You are the mo&s;t tem|perate man God-ward, and the mo&s;t intem|perate your &s;elf-ward, of mo&s;t I have known. I &s;uppo&s;e Mr. Gay will return from the Bath with twenty pounds more fle&s;h, and two hundred le&s;s in money: Providence never de&s;ign'd him to be above two and twenty, by his thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s and Cullibility. He hath as little fore&s;ight of age, &s;ickne&s;s, poverty, or lo&s;s of admirers, as a girl at fifteen. By the way, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that my Lord Bolingbroke (from the effects of his kindne&s;s to me) argues mo&s;t &s;ophi&s;tically: The fall from a million to an hundred-thou|&s;and pounds is not &s;o great, as from eight hun|dred pounds a year to one: Be&s;ides, he is a controller of Fortune, and Poverty dares not look a great Mini&s;ter in the face, under his low|e&s;t declen&s;ion. I never knew him live &s;o great and expen&s;ively as he hath done &s;ince his re|turn from Exile; &s;uch mortals have re&s;ources
<PB N="120" REF="138">
that others are not able to comprehend. But God ble&s;s You, who&s;e great genius has not &s;o tran&s;ported you as to leave you to the courte&s;y of mankind; for wealth is liberty, and liberty is a ble&s;&s;ing fitte&s;t for a Philo&s;opher&mdash;and Gay is a Slave ju&s;t by two thou&s;and pounds too lit|tle.&mdash;And Horace was of my mind, and let my Lord contradict him, if he dares.&mdash;</P>

<P>I Have pa&s;t &s;ix weeks in que&s;t of health, and found it not; but I found the folly of &s;ol|licitude about it in a hundred in&s;tances; the contrariety of opinions and practices, the inabi|lity of phy&s;icians, the blind obedience of &s;ome patients, and as blind rebellion of others.

<P>It was much in my hopes that you intended us a winter's vi&s;it, but la&s;t week I repented that wi&s;h, having been alarm'd with a report of your lying ill on the road from Ireland; from which I am ju&s;t reliev'd by an a&s;&s;urance that you are &s;till at Sir A&mdash;'s planting and building; two things that I envy you for, be&s;ides a third,
<PB N="121" REF="139">
which is the &s;ociety of a valuable Lady. I conclude (tho' I know nothing of it) that you quarrel with her, and abu&s;e her every day, if &s;he is &s;o. I wonder I hear of no Lampoons upon her, either made by your&s;elf, or by others, becau&s;e you e&s;teem her. I think it a va&s;t plea|&s;ure that whenever two people of merit regard one another, &s;o many &s;croundrels envy and are angry at them; 'tis bearing te&s;timony to a me|rit they cannot reach; and if you knew the infinite content I have receiv'd of late, at the finding yours and my name con&s;tantly united in any &s;illy &s;candal, I think you would go near to &s;ing <HI>Io Triumphe!</HI> and celebrate my happine&s;s in ver&s;e; and, I believe, if you won't, I &s;hall. The in&s;cription to the Dunciad is now printed and in&s;erted in the Poem. Do you care I &s;hould &s;ay any thing farther how much that poem is yours? &s;ince certainly without you it had never been. Would to God we were together for the re&s;t of our lives! The whole weight of Scriblers would ju&s;t &s;erve to find us amu&s;ement, and not more. I hope you are too well em|ployed to mind them: every &s;tick you plant, and every &s;tone you lay, is to &s;ome purpo&s;e; but the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;uch lives as theirs is but to die daily, to labour, and rai&s;e nothing. I only wi&s;h we could comfort each other under our bodily infirmities, and let tho&s;e who have &s;o

great a mind to have more Wit than we, win it and wear it. Give us but ea&s;e, health, peace, and fair weather! I think it is the be&s;t wi&s;h in the world, and you know who&s;e it was. If I liv'd in Ireland, I fear the wet climate wou'd indanger more than my life; my humour, and health; I am &s;o Atmo&s;pherical a creature.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit acquainting you, that what you heard of the words &s;poken of you in the Drawing-room, was not true.

But this renews the grief for the death of our friend Mr. Congreve, whom I loved from my youth, and who &s;urely, be&s;ides his other talents, was a very agreeable companion. He had the misfortune to &s;quander away a ve|ry good con&s;titution in his younger days; and I think a man of &s;en&s;e and merit like him, is bound in con&s;cience to pre&s;erve his health for the &s;ake of his friends, as well as of him&s;elf. Upon his own account I could not much de&s;ire the continuance of his life, under &s;o much pain, and &s;o many infirmities. Years have not yet hardened me; and I have an addition of weight on my &s;pirits &s;ince we lo&s;t him; tho' I &s;aw him &s;o &s;eldom, and po&s;&s;ibly, if he had liv'd on, &s;hould never have &s;een him more.

He has twen|ty of the&s;e at command; if one of them dies, it is no more than poor Tom! he gets another, or takes up with the re&s;t, and is no more mov'd than at the lo&s;s of his cat; he offends no-body, is ea&s;y with every body&mdash;Is not this the true happy man? I was de&s;cribing him to my La|dy A&mdash;, who knows him too, but &s;he hates him mortally by my character, and will not drink his health: I would give half my fortune for the &s;ame temper, and yet I cannot &s;ay I love it, for I do not love my Lord&mdash;who is much of the Doctor's nature.

<OPENER><DATELINE>Dublin, <DATE>April 5, 1729.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Do not think it could be po&s;&s;ible for me to hear better news than that of your getting over your &s;curvy &s;uit, which always hung as a
<PB N="129" REF="147">
dead weight on my heart; I hated it in all its circum&s;tances, as it affected your fortune and quiet, and in a &s;ituation of life that mu&s;t make it every way vexatious. And as I am infinitely obliged to you for the ju&s;tice you do me in &s;uppo&s;ing your affairs do at lea&s;t concern me as much as my own; &s;o I would never have par|doned your omitting it. But before I go on, I cannot forbear mentioning what I read la&s;t &s;ummer in a news-paper, that you were writ|ing the hi&s;tory of your own times. I &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a report might ari&s;e from what was not &s;ecret among your friends, of your intention to write another kind of hi&s;tory; which you often promis'd Mr. Pope and me to do: I know he de&s;ires it very much, and I am &s;ure I de&s;ire nothing more, for the honour and love I bear you, and the perfect knowledge I have of your public virtue. My Lord, I have no other notion of Oeconomy than that it is the parent of Liberty and Ea&s;e, and I am not the only friend you have who hath chid you in his heart for the neglect of it, tho' not with his mouth, as I have done. For there is a &s;illy error in the world, even among friends other|wi&s;e very good, not to intermeddle with mens affairs in &s;uch nice matters. And, my Lord, I have made a maxim, that &s;hould be writ in letters of diamonds, That a wi&s;e man ought to
<PB N="130" REF="148">
have Mony in his head, but not in his heart. Pray, my Lord, enquire whether your Proto|type, my Lord Digby, after the Re&s;toration when he was at Bri&s;tol, did not take &s;ome care of his fortune, notwith&s;tanding that quotation I once &s;ent you out of his &s;peech to the H. of Commons? In my con&s;cience, I believe For|tune, like other drabbs, values a man gradually le&s;s for every year he lives. I have demon&s;tra|tion for it; becau&s;e if I play at piquet for &s;ix|pence with a man or a woman two years younger than my&s;elf, I always lo&s;e; and there is a young girl of twenty, who never fails of winning my mony at Back-gammon, tho' &s;he is a bungler, and the game be Eccle&s;ia&s;tic. As to the public, I confe&s;s nothing could cure my itch of medling with it but the&s;e frequent re|turns of deafne&s;s, which have hindred me from pa&s;&s;ing la&s;t winter in London; yet I can|not but con&s;ider the perfidiou&s;ne&s;s of &s;ome people, who I thought when I was la&s;t there, upon a change that happened, were the mo&s;t impudent in forgetting their profe&s;&s;ions that I have ever known. Pray, will you plea&s;e to take your pen, and blot me out that political maxim from whatever book it is in, that <HI>Res nolunt diu male admini&s;trari;</HI> the commonne&s;s makes me not know who is the author, but &s;ure he mu&s;t be &s;ome Modern.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="149">
I am &s;orry for Lady Bolingbroke's ill health; but I prote&s;t I never knew a very de&s;erving per&s;on of that &s;ex, who had not too much rea|&s;on to complain of ill health. I never wake without finding life a more in&s;ignificant thing than it was the day before: which is one great advantage I get by living in this country, where there is nothing I &s;hall be &s;orry to lo&s;e. But my greate&s;t mi&s;ery is recollecting the &s;cene of twenty years pa&s;t, and then all on a &s;udden dropping into the pre&s;ent. I remember, when I was a little boy, I felt a great fi&s;h at the end of my line, which I drew up almo&s;t on the ground, but it dropt in, and the di&s;appoint|ment vexes me to this very day, and, I believe, it was the type of all my future di&s;appoint|ments. I &s;hould be a&s;ham'd to &s;ay this to you, if you had not a &s;pirit fitter to bear your own misfortunes, than I have to think of them. Is there patience left to reflect, by what qualities wealth and greatne&s;s are got, and by what qualities they are lo&s;t? I have read my friend Congreve's ver&s;es to Lord Cob|ham, which end with a vile and fal&s;e moral, and I remember is not in Horace to Tibullus, which he imitates, <Q>&startq;that all times are equally virtuous and vicious,&endq;</Q> wherein he differs from all Poets, Philo&s;ophers, and Chri&s;tians that ever writ. It is more probable that there
<PB N="132" REF="150">
may be an equal quantity of virtues always in the world, but &s;ometimes there may be a peck of it in A&s;ia, and hardly a thimble-full in Eu|rope. But if there be no virtue, there is abund|ance of &s;incerity; for I will venture all I am worth, that there is not one humane creature in power, who will not be mode&s;t enough to con|fe&s;s that he proceeds wholly upon a principle of Corruption. I &s;ay this, becau&s;e I have a &s;cheme in &s;pite of your notions, to govern England upon the principles of Virtue, and when the nation is ripe for it, I de&s;ire you will &s;end for me. I have learn'd this by liv|ing like a Hermit, by which I am got back|wards about nineteen hundred years in the Aera of the world, and begin to wonder at the wickedne&s;s of men. I dine alone upon half a di&s;h of meat, mix water with my wine, walk ten miles a day, and read Baronius. <HI>Hic ex|plicit Epi&s;tola ad Dom.</HI> Bolingbroke, <HI>et incipit ad amicum</HI> Pope.</P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed my Letter to Ari&s;tippus, I now begin to you. I was in great pain about Mrs. Pope, having heard from others that &s;he was in a very dangerous way, which made me think it un&s;ea&s;onable to trouble you. I am a&s;hamed to tell you, that when I was very young I had more de&s;ire to be famous than
<PB N="133" REF="151">
ever &s;ince; and fame, like all things el&s;e in this life, grows with me every day more a tri|fle. But you who are &s;o much younger, al|though you want that health you de&s;erve, yet your &s;pirits are as vigorous as if your body were &s;ounder. I hate a crowd, where I have not an ea&s;y place to &s;ee and be &s;een. A great Library always makes me melancholy, where the be&s;t Author is as much &s;queezed, and as ob&s;cure, as a Porter at a Coronation. In my own little library, I value the compilements of Graevius and Gronovius, which make thirty|one volumes in folio (and were given me by my Lord Bolingbroke) more than all my books be&s;ides; becau&s;e whoever comes into my clo|&s;et, ca&s;ts his eyes immediately upon them, and will not vouch&s;afe to look upon Plato or Xe|nophon. I tell you it is almo&s;t incredible how Opinions change by the decline or decay of &s;pirits, and I will further tell you, that all my endeavours, from a boy to di&s;tingui&s;h my&s;elf, were only for want of a great Title and For|tune, that I might be u&s;ed like a Lord by tho&s;e who have an opinion of my parts; whether right or wrong, it is no great matter; and &s;o the reputation of wit or great learning does the office of a blue ribband, or of a coach and &s;ix hor&s;es. To be remembred for ever on the ac|count of our friend&s;hip, is what would exceed|ingly
<PB N="134" REF="152">
plea&s;e me; but yet I never lov'd to make a vi&s;it, or be &s;een walking with my betters, be|cau&s;e they get all the eyes and civilities from me. I no &s;ooner writ this than I corrected my|&s;elf, and remember'd Sir Fulk Grevil's Epi|taph, <Q>&startq;Here lies, &amp;c. who was friend to Sir Philip Sidney.&endq;</Q> And therefore I mo&s;t heartily thank you for your de&s;ire that I would record our friend&s;hip in ver&s;e, which if I can &s;ucceed in, I will never de&s;ire to write one more line in poetry while I live. You mu&s;t pre&s;ent my humble &s;ervice to Mrs. Pope, and let her know I pray for her continuance in the world, for her own rea&s;on, that &s;he may live to take care of you.</P>

<P>I Am very &s;en&s;ible that in a former letter I talked very weakly of my own affairs, and of my imperfect wi&s;hes and de&s;ires, which however I find with &s;ome comfort do now daily decline, very &s;uitable to my &s;tate of health for &s;ome months pa&s;t. For my head is never perfectly free from giddine&s;s, and e&s;|pecially towards night. Yet my di&s;order is
<PB N="135" REF="153">
very moderate, and I have been without a fit of deafne&s;s this half year; &s;o I am like a hor&s;e, which, though off his mettle, can trot on tole|rably; and this compari&s;on puts me in mind to add, that I am returned to be a rider, where|in I wi&s;h you would imitate me. As to this country, there have been three terrible years dearth of corn, and every place &s;trowed with beggars; but dearths are common in better cli|mates, and our evils here lie much deeper. Imagine a nation the two thirds of who&s;e re|venues are &s;pent out of it, and who are not permitted to trade with the other third, and where the pride of women will not &s;uffer them to wear their own manufactures even where they excel what come from abroad: This is the true &s;tate of Ireland in a very few words. The&s;e evils operate more every day, and the kingdom is ab&s;olutely undone, as I have been telling often in print the&s;e ten years pa&s;t.</P>
<P>What I have &s;aid requires forgivene&s;s, but I had a mind for once to let you know the &s;tate of our affairs, and my rea&s;on for being more moved than perhaps becomes a Clergyman, and a piece of a Philo&s;opher: and perhaps the increa&s;e of years and di&s;orders may hope for &s;ome allowance to complaints, e&s;pecially when I may call my&s;elf a &s;tranger in a &s;trange land. As to poor Mrs. Pope (if &s;he be &s;till alive) I
<PB N="136" REF="154">
heartily pity you and pity her: her great piety and virtue will infallibly make her happy in a better life, and her great age hath made her ful|ly ripe for heaven and the grave, and her be&s;t friends will mo&s;t wi&s;h her ea&s;ed of her labours, when &s;he hath &s;o many good works to follow them. The lo&s;s you will feel by the want of her care and kindne&s;s, I know very well; but &s;he has amply done her part, as you have yours. One rea&s;on why I would have you in Ireland when you &s;hall be at your own di&s;po&s;al, is that you may be ma&s;ter of two or three years reve|nues, <HI>provi&s;ae frugis in annos copia,</HI> &s;o as not to be pinch'd in the lea&s;t when years increa&s;e, and perhaps your health impairs: And when this kingdom is utterly at an end, you may &s;upport me for the few years I &s;hall happen to live; and who knows but you may pay me exorbitant intere&s;t for the &s;poonful of wine, and &s;craps of a chicken it will co&s;t me to feed you? I am confident you have too much rea|&s;on to complain of ingratitude; for I never yet knew any per&s;on, one tenth part, &s;o heartily di&s;|po&s;ed as you are, to do good offices to others, without the lea&s;t private view.</P>
<P>Was it a Ga&s;conade to plea&s;e me, that you &s;aid your fortune was increa&s;ed 100 <HI>l.</HI> a year &s;ince I left you? you &s;hould have told me how. Tho&s;e <HI>&s;ub&s;idia &s;enectuti</HI> are extremely
<PB N="137" REF="155">
de&s;irable, if they could be got with ju&s;tice, and without avarice; of which vice tho' I can|not charge my&s;elf yet, nor feel any approaches towards it, yet no u&s;urer more wi&s;hes to be richer (or rather to be &s;urer of his rents.) But I am not half &s;o moderate as you, for I de|clare I cannot live ea&s;ily under double to what you are &s;atisfied with.</P>
<P>I hope Mr. Gay will keep his 3000<HI>l.</HI> and live on the intere&s;t without decrea&s;ing the prin|cipal one penny; but I do not like your &s;el|dom &s;eeing him. I hope he is grown more di&s;engaged from his intentne&s;s on his own af|fairs, which I ever di&s;liked, and is quite the rever&s;e to you, unle&s;s you are a very dextrous di&s;gui&s;er. I de&s;ire my humble &s;ervice to Lord Oxford, Lord Bathur&s;t, and particularly to Mrs. B&mdash;, but to no Lady at court.

<P>IT plea&s;es me that you received my books at la&s;t: but you have never once told me if you approve the whole, or di&s;approve not of
<PB N="138" REF="156">
&s;ome parts, of the Commentary, &amp;c. It was my principal aim in the entire work to perpe|tuate the friend&s;hip between us, and to &s;hew that the friends or the enemies of one were the friends or enemies of the other: If in any particular, any thing be &s;tated or mention'd in a different manner from what you like, pray tell me freely, that the new Editions now coming out here, may have it rectify'd. You'll find the octavo rather more correct than the quarto, with &s;ome additions to the Notes and Epigrams ca&s;t in, which I wi&s;h had been en|creas'd by your acquaintance in Ireland. I re|joyce in hearing that Drapiers-Hill is to emu|late Parna&s;&s;us; I fear the country about it is as much impoveri&s;h'd. I truly &s;hare in all that troubles you, and wi&s;h you remov'd from a &s;cene of di&s;tre&s;s, which I know works your compa&s;&s;ionate temper too &s;trongly. But if we are not to &s;ee you here, I believe I &s;hall once in my life &s;ee you there. You think more for me, and about me, than any friend I have, and you think better for me. Perhaps you'll not be contented, tho' I am, that the addi|tional 100<HI>l.</HI> a year is only for my life. My mother is yet living, and I thank God for it: &s;he will never be trouble&s;ome to me, if &s;he be not &s;o to her&s;elf: but a melancholy object it is, to ob&s;erve the gradual decays both of body and
<PB N="139" REF="157">
mind, in a per&s;on to whom one is tyed by the links of both. I can't tell whether her death it&s;elf would be &s;o afflicting.</P>
<P>You are too careful of my worldly affairs; I am rich enough, and I can afford to give away a 100<HI>l.</HI> a year. Don't be angry: I will not live to be very old; I have Revelations to the contrary. I would not crawl upon the earth without doing a little good when I have a mind to do it: I will enjoy the plea&s;ure of what I give, by giving it, alive, and &s;eeing an|other enjoy it. When I die, I &s;hould be a|&s;ham'd to leave enough to build me a monu|ment, if there were a wanting friend above ground.</P>
<P>Mr. Gay a&s;&s;ures me his 3000<HI>l.</HI> is kept en|tire and &s;acred; he &s;eems to langui&s;h after a line from you, and complains tenderly. Lord Bolingbroke has told me ten times over he was going to write to you. Has he, or not? The Dr. is unalterable, both in friend&s;hip and Qua|drille: his wife has been very near death la&s;t week: his two brothers buried their wives within the&s;e &s;ix weeks. Gay is &s;ixty miles off, and has been &s;o all this &s;ummer, with the Duke and Duche&s;s of Queen&s;bury. He is the &s;ame man: So is every one here that you know: mankind is unamendable. <HI>Optimus ille Qui minimis urgetur</HI>&mdash;Poor Mrs. * is like the re&s;t,

&s;he cries at the thorn in her foot, but will &s;uf|fer no-body to pull it out. The Court-lady I have a good opinion of, yet I have treated her more negligently than you wou'd do, becau&s;e you like to &s;ee the in&s;ide of a court, which I do not. I have &s;een her but twice. You have a de&s;perate hand at da&s;hing out a character by great &s;trokes, and at the &s;ame time a delicate one at fine touches. God forbid you &s;hou'd draw mine, if I were con&s;cious of any guilt: But if I were con&s;cious only of folly, God &s;end it! for as no-body can detect a great fault &s;o well as you, no-body would &s;o well hide a &s;mall one. But after all, that Lady means to do good, and does no harm, which is a va&s;t deal for a Courtier. I can a&s;&s;ure you that Lord Peterborow always &s;peaks kindly of you, and certainly has as great a mind to be your friend as any one. I mu&s;t throw away my pen; it cannot, it will never tell you, what I inward|ly am to you. <HI>Quod nequeo mon&s;trare, et &s;en|tio tantum.</HI></P>

<P>I Have brought your French acquaintance thus far on her way into her own country, and con&s;iderably better in health than &s;he was when &s;he went to Aix. I begin to entertain hopes that &s;he will recover &s;uch a degree of health as may render old age &s;upportable. Both of us have clo&s;ed the tenth Lu&s;ter, and it is high time to determine how we &s;hall play the la&s;t act of the Farce. Might not my life be entituled much more properly a <HI>What-d'ye-call-it</HI> than a <HI>Farce?</HI> &s;ome Comedy, a great deal of Tragedy, and the whole inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;cenes of Harlequin, Scaramouch, and Dr. Baloardo, the prototype of your Hero.&mdash;I u&s;ed to think &s;ometimes formerly of old age and of death: enough to prepare my mind; not enough to anticipate &s;orrow, to da&s;h the joys of youth, and to be all my life a dying. I find the benefit of this practice now, and find it more as I proceed on my journey: little regret when I look backwards, little apprehen|&s;ion when I look forward. You complain grievou&s;ly of your &s;ituation in Ireland: I would complain of mine too in England, but I will
<PB N="142" REF="160" MS="Y">
not, nay, I ought not; for I find by long ex|perience that I can be unfortunate without be|ing unhappy. I do not approve your joining together the <HI>figure of living,</HI> and the <HI>plea&s;ure of giving,</HI> tho' your old prating friend Mon|tagne does &s;omething like it in one of his Rap|&s;odies. To tell you my rea&s;ons would be to write an E&s;&s;ay, and I &s;hall hardly have time to write a Letter; but if you will come over, and live with Pope and me, I'll &s;hew you in an in&s;tant why $o&s;e two things &s;hould not <HI>al|ler de pair,</HI> and that forced retrenchments on both may be made, without making us even unea&s;y. You know that I am too expen&s;ive, and all mankind knows that I have been cruel|ly plundered; and yet I feel in my mind the power of de&s;cending without anxiety two or three &s;tages more. In &s;hort (Mr. Dean) if you will come to a certain farm in Middle&s;ex, you &s;hall find that I can live frugally without growling at the world, or being peevi&s;h with tho&s;e whom fortune has appointed to eat my bread, in&s;tead of appointing me to eat theirs: and yet I have naturally as little di&s;po&s;ition to frugality as any man alive. You &s;ay you are no philo&s;opher, and I think you are in the right to di&s;like a word which is &s;o often abu&s;ed; but I am &s;ure you like to follow rea&s;on, not cu&s;|tom, (which is &s;ometimes the rea&s;on and oft|ner
<PB N="143" REF="161">
the caprice of others, of the mob of the world.) Now to be &s;ure of doing this, you mu&s;t wear your philo&s;ophical &s;pectacles as con|&s;tantly as the Spaniards u&s;ed to wear theirs. You mu&s;t make them part of your dre&s;s, and &s;ooner part with your broad-brimm'd beaver, your gown, your &s;carf, or even that emblema|tical ve&s;tment your &s;urplice. Thro' this me|dium you will &s;ee few things to be vexed at, few per&s;ons to be angry at: and yet there will fre|quently be things which we ought to wi&s;h al|tered, and per&s;ons whom we ought to wi&s;h hanged.</P>
<P>In your letter to Pope, you agree that a regard for Fame becomes a man more towards his Exit, than at his entrance into life; and yet you confe&s;s, that the longer you live, the more you grow indifferent about it. Your &s;entiment is true and natural; your rea&s;oning, I am afraid, is not &s;o upon this occa&s;ion. Prudence will make us de&s;ire Fame, becau&s;e it gives us many real and great advantages in all the affairs of life. Fame is the wi&s;e man's means; his ends are his own good, and the good of &s;ociety. You Poets and Orators have inverted this or|der; you propo&s;e Fame as the end; and good, or at lea&s;t great actions, as the means. You go further: You teach our &s;elf-love to antici|pate the applau&s;e which we &s;uppo&s;e will be
<PB N="144" REF="162">
paid by po&s;terity to our names; and with idle notions of immortality you turn other heads be|&s;ides your own: I am afraid this may have done &s;ome harm in the world.</P>
<P>Fame is an object which men pur&s;ue &s;ucce&s;s|fully by various and even contrary cour&s;es. Your doctrine leads them to look on this end as e&s;&s;ential, and on the means as indifferent; &s;o that Fabricius and Cra&s;&s;us, Cato and Cae&s;ar pre&s;&s;ed forward to the &s;ame goal. After all perhaps it may appear, from a con&s;ideration of the depravity of mankind, that you could do no better, nor keep up virtue in the world without calling this pa&s;&s;ion or this direction of &s;elf-love, in to your aid: <HI>Tacitus</HI> has crowded this excu&s;e for you, according to his manner, into a maxim, <HI>Contemptu famae, contemni vir|tutes.</HI> But now whether we con&s;ider Fame as an u&s;eful in&s;trument in all the occurrences of private and public life, or whether we con&s;i|der it as the cau&s;e of that plea&s;ure which our &s;elf-love is &s;o fond of; methinks our entrance into life, or (to &s;peak more properly) our youth, not our old age, is the &s;ea&s;on when we ought to de&s;ire it mo&s;t, and therefore when it is mo&s;t becoming to de&s;ire it with ardor. If it is u&s;eful, it is to be de&s;ired mo&s;t when we have, or may hope to have, a long &s;cene of ac|tion open before us: Towards our exit, this
<PB N="145" REF="163">
&s;cene of action is or &s;hould be clo&s;ed; and then, methinks, it is unbecoming to grow fonder of a thing which we have no longer occa&s;ion for. If it is plea&s;ant, the &s;ooner we are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of fame the longer we &s;hall enjoy this plea&s;ure. When it is acquired early in life it may tickle us on till old age; but when it is acquired late, the &s;en&s;ation of plea&s;ure will be more faint, and mingled with the regret of our not having ta&s;t|ed it &s;ooner.</P>

He tells me a thing I am &s;orry to hear: You are building, it &s;eems, on a piece of land you have acquired for that purpo&s;e, in &s;ome county of Ireland. Tho' I have built in a part of the world, which I pre|fer very little to that where you have been thrown and confined by our ill fortune and yours, yet I am &s;orry you do the &s;ame thing. I have re|pented a thou&s;and times of my re&s;olution, and I hope you will repent of yours before it is exe|cuted. Adieu, my old and worthy friend; may the phy&s;ical evils of life &s;all as ea&s;ily upon you, as ever they did on any man who lived to be old; and may the moral evils which &s;urround us, make as little impre&s;&s;ion on you, as they ought to make on one who has &s;uch &s;uperior &s;en&s;e to e&s;timate things by, and &s;o much vir|tue to wrap him&s;elf up in.</P>

My wife de&s;ires not to be forgotten by you; &s;he's faithfully your &s;ervant, and zealou&s;ly your admirer. She will be concerned and di&s;ap|pointed not to find you in this I&s;land at her re|turn, which hope both &s;he and I had been made to entertain before I went abroad.</P>

<P>I Receiv'd your Lord&s;hip's travelling letter of &s;everal dates, at &s;everal &s;tages, and from different nations, languages, and religions. Nei|ther could any thing be more obliging than your kind remembrance of me in &s;o many places. As to your ten Lu&s;tres, I remember, when I complain'd in a letter to Prior, that I was fifty years old, he was half angry in je&s;t, and an|&s;wered me out of Terence, <HI>i&s;ta commemoratio e&s;t qua&s;i exprobratio.</HI> How then ought I to rat|tle you, when I have a dozen years more to an&s;wer for, all mona&s;tically pa&s;&s;ed in this Coun|try of liberty and delight, and money, and good company! I go on an&s;wering your letter; It is you were my Hero, but the other<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">L.

him, in the beginning of your mini&s;try, from my accu&s;ations. But I granted he had the greate&s;t inequalities of any man alive, and his whole &s;cene was fifty times more a What-d'ye-call it, than yours: for, I declare, yours was <HI>unie,</HI> and I wi&s;h you would &s;o order it, that the world may be as wi&s;e as I upon that arti|cle: Mr. Pope wi&s;hes it too, and I believe there is not a more hone&s;t man in England, even without wit. But you regard us not.&mdash;I was<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The Year of Queen Anne's Death.</NOTE> forty &s;even years old when I began to think of death, and the reflections upon it now begin when I wake in the morning, and end when I am going to &s;leep.&mdash;I writ to Mr. Pope and not to you. My birth, although from a fa|mily not undi&s;tingui&s;hed in its time, is many degrees inferior to your's; all my preten&s;ions from per&s;on and parts infinitely &s;o; I a youn|ger &s;on of younger &s;ons; you born to a great fortune: yet I &s;ee you with all your advan|tages, &s;unk to a degree that you could never have been without them: But yet I &s;ee you as much e&s;teemed, as much beloved, as much dreaded, and perhaps more (though it be al|mo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible) than ever you were in your highe&s;t exaltation&mdash;only I grieve like an Al|derman that you are not &s;o rich. And yet, my Lord, I pretend to value money as little as you,
<PB N="148" REF="166" MS="Y">
and I will call five hundred witne&s;&s;es (if you will take Iri&s;h witne&s;&s;es) to prove it. I renounce your whole philo&s;ophy, becau&s;e it is not your practice. By the <HI>figure of living,</HI> (if I u&s;ed that expre&s;&s;ion to Mr. Pope) I do not mean the pa|rade, but a &s;uitablene&s;s to your mind; and as for the <HI>plea&s;ure of giving,</HI> I know your &s;oul &s;uffers when you are debarr'd of it. Could you, when your own genero&s;ity and contempt of outward things (be not offended, it is no Eccle&s;ia&s;tical but an Epictetian phra&s;e) could you, when the&s;e have brought you to it, come over and live with Mr. Pope and me at the Deanery? I could almo&s;t wi&s;h the experiment were tried&mdash;No, God forbid, that ever &s;uch a &s;coundrel as Want &s;hould dare to approach you. But, in the mean time, do not brag, Retrench|ments are not your talent. But, as old Wey|mouth &s;aid to me in his Lordly Latin, <HI>Philo&s;o|pha verba, $gnava opera;</HI> I wi&s;h you could learn Arithmetic, that three and two make five, and will never make more. My philo&s;ophical &s;pectacles which you advi&s;e me to, will tell me that I can live on 50 <HI>l.</HI> a year (wine excluded, which my bad health forces me to) but I can|not endure that <HI>Otium</HI> &s;hould be <HI>&s;ine dignitate.</HI>&mdash;My Lord, what I would have &s;aid of Fame is meant of fame which a man enjoys in his life; becau&s;e I cannot be a great Lord, I would
<PB N="149" REF="167" MS="Y">
acquire what is a kind of <HI>&s;ub&s;idium,</HI> I would en|deavour that my betters &s;hould &s;eek me by the merit of &s;omething di&s;tingui&s;hable, in&s;tead of my &s;eeking them. The de&s;ire of enjoying it in after-times is owing to the &s;pirit and folly of youth: but with age we learn to know the hou&s;e is &s;o full, that there is no room for above one or two at mo&s;t in an age, through the whole world. My Lord, I hate and love to write to you, it gives me plea&s;ure, and kills me with melancholy. The D&mdash;take &s;tupidity, that it will not come to &s;upply the want of philo|&s;ophy.</P>

<P>YOU were &s;o careful of &s;ending me the Dunciad, that I have received five of them, and have plea&s;ed four friends. I am one of every body who approve every part of it, Text and Comment; but am one ab&s;tracted from every body, in the happine&s;s of being record|ed your friend, while wit, and humour, and politene&s;s &s;hall have any memorial among us. As for your octavo edition, we know nothing
<PB N="150" REF="168">
of it, for we have an octavo of our own, which hath &s;old wonderfully, con&s;idering our poverty, and dulne&s;s the con&s;equence of it.</P>
<P>I writ this po&s;t to Lord B. and tell him in my letter, that, with a great deal of lo&s;s for a frolick, I will fly as &s;oon as build; I have nei|ther years, nor &s;pirits, nor money, nor pati|ence for &s;uch amu&s;ements. The frolick is gone off, and I am only 100 <HI>l.</HI> the poorer. But this kingdom is grown &s;o exce&s;&s;ively poor, that we wi&s;e men mu&s;t think of nothing but getting a little ready money. It is thought there are not two hundred thou&s;and pounds of &s;pecies in the whole i&s;land; for we return thrice as much to our Ab&s;entees, as we get by trade, and &s;o are all inevitably undone; which I have been tel|ling them in print the&s;e ten years, to as little purpo&s;e as if it came from the pulpit. And this is enough for Iri&s;h politics, which I only men|tion, becau&s;e it &s;o nearly touches my&s;elf. I mu&s;t repeat what, I believe, I have &s;aid before, that I pity you much more than Mrs. Pope. Such a parent and friend hourly declining be|fore your eyes is an object very unfit for your health, and duty, and tender di&s;po&s;ition; and I pray God it may not affect you too much. I am as much &s;atisfied that your additional 100 <HI>l. per Annum</HI> is for your life as if it were for ever. You hare enough to leave your friends, I would
<PB N="151" REF="169">
not have them glad to be rid of you; and I &s;hall take care that none but my enemies will be glad to get rid of me. You have embroil|ed me with Lord B&mdash;about the figure of living, and the plea&s;ure of giving. I am under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome little paultry figure in the &s;tation I am; but I make it as little as po&s;&s;ible. As to the other part you are ba&s;e, becau&s;e I thought my&s;elf as great a giver as ever was of my ability; and yet in proportion you exceed, and have kept it till now a &s;ecret even from me, when I wondred how you were able to live with your whole little revenue.</P>

Whether you are more obliged to me for loving you as well when I knew you le&s;s, or for loving you as well after loving you &s;o many years, I &s;hall not de|termine. What I would &s;ay is this: whil&s;t my mind grows daily more independant of the world, and feels le&s;s need of leaning on exter|nal objects, the ideas of friend&s;hip return oft|ner, they bu&s;y me, they warm me more: Is it that we grow more tender as the moment of our great &s;eparation approaches? or is it that they who are to live together in another &s;tate, (for <HI>vera amicitia non ni&s;i inter bonos)</HI> begin to feel more &s;trongly that divine &s;ympathy which is to be the great band of their future &s;ociety? There is no one thought which &s;ooths my mind like this: I encourage my imagination to pur|&s;ue it, and am heartily afflicted when another faculty<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Viz. <HI>Rea&s;on.</HI> Tully (or, what is much the &s;ame, his Di&s;ciple) ob&s;erves &s;omething like this on the like occa&s;ion, where, &s;peaking of Plato's famous book of the Soul, he &s;ays, <HI>Ni&s;cio quom$do, dum l$go, ad&s;entior: cum po&s;ui librum, et mecum ip&s;e de im|mortalitate animorum coepi cogitare, ad&s;en&s;io illa omnis elabitur.</HI> Cicero, &s;eems to have had but a confu&s;ed no|tion of the <HI>cau&s;e,</HI> which the Letter-writer has here ex|plained, namely, that the <HI>imagination</HI> is always ready to indulge &s;o flattering an idea, but &s;everer <HI>rea&s;on</HI> cor|rects and di&s;claims it.

I do a&s;&s;ure you, that I have never quitted the de&s;ign of collecting, revi&s;ing, improving, and extending &s;everal materials whicha are &s;till in my power; and I hope that the time of fetting my|&s;elf about this la&s;t work of my life is not far off. Many papers of much curio&s;ity and importance are lo&s;t, and &s;ome of them in a manner which would &s;urprize and anger you.

Adieu, my friend. I have taken up more of this paper than belongs to me, &s;ince Pope is to write to you; no matter, for, upon recollection, the rules of proportion are not broken; he will &s;ay as much to you in one page, as I have &s;aid in three. Bid him talk to you of the work he is about, I hope in good earne&s;t; it is a fine one; and will be, in his hands, an original <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay on Man.</NOTE>. His &s;ole complaint is, that he finds it too ea&s;y in the

<P>THIS letter (like all mine) will be a Rhap&s;ody; it is many years ago &s;ince I wrote as a Wit <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">He u&s;ed to value him&s;elf on this particular.</NOTE>. How many occurrences or informations mu&s;t one omit, if one determin'd to &s;ay nothing that one could not &s;ay prettily? I lately receiv'd from the widow of one dead corre&s;pondent, and the father of another, &s;e|veral of my own letters of about fifteen and twenty years old; and it was not unentertain|ing to my&s;elf to ob&s;erve, how and by what de|grees I ceas'd to be a witty writer; as either my experience grew on the one hand, or my affection to my corre&s;pondents on the other. Now as I love you better than mo&s;t I have ever met with in the world, and e&s;teem you too the more, the longer I have compar'd you with the re&s;t of the world; &s;o inevitably I write to you more negligently, that is, more openly, and what

<P>You can't imagine what a vanity it is to me, to have &s;omething to rebuke you for in the way of Oeconomy. I love the man that builds a a hou&s;e <HI>&s;ubito ingenio,</HI> and makes a wall for a hor&s;e: then cries, <Q>&startq;We wi&s;e men mu&s;t think of nothing but getting ready money.&endq;</Q> I am glad you approve my annuity; all we have in this world is no more than an annuity, as to our own enjoyment: but I will encrea&s;e your regard for my wi&s;dom, and tell you, that this annuity includes al&s;o the life of another <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">His Mother's.</NOTE>, who&s;e concern ought to be as near me as my own, and with whom my whole pro&s;pects ought to fini&s;h.

<P>The &s;econd (as it is called, but indeed the eighth) edition of the Dunciad, with &s;ome ad|ditional notes and epigrams, &s;hall be &s;ent you, if I know any opportunity; if they reprint it with you, let them by all means follow that octavo edition.&mdash;The Drapier's letters are again printed here, very laudably as to paper, print, &amp;c. for you know I di&s;approve Iri&s;h politics, (as my Commentator tells you) being a &s;trong
<PB N="156" REF="174" MS="Y">
and jealous &s;ubject of England. The Lady you mention, you ought not complain of for not acknowledging your pre&s;ent; &s;he having lately receiv'd a much richer pre&s;ent from Mr. Knight of the S. Sea; and you are &s;en&s;ible &s;he cannot ever return it to one in the condition of an out|law. It's certain, as he can never expect any favour <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">He was mi&s;taken in this. Mr. Knight was pardoned, and came home in the year 1742.</NOTE>, his motive mu&s;t be wholly di&s;-in|tere&s;ted. Will not this Reflection make you blu&s;h? Your continual deplorings of Ireland, make me wi&s;h you were here long enough to forget tho&s;e &s;cenes that &s;o afflict you: I am on|ly in fear if you were, you would grow &s;uch a patriot here too, as not to be quite at ea&s;e, for your love of old England.&mdash;It is very po&s;&s;i|ble, your journey, in the time I compute, might exactly tally with my intended one to you; and if you mu&s;t &s;oon again go back, you would not be un-attended. For the poor woman decays perceptibly every week; and the winter may too probably put an end to a very long, and a very irreproachable life. My con&s;tant attend|ance on her does indeed affect my mind very much, and le&s;&s;en extremely my de&s;ires of long life; &s;ince I &s;ee the be&s;t that can come of it is a mi&s;erable benediction. I look upon my&s;elf to be many years older in two years &s;ince you
<PB N="157" REF="175">
&s;aw me: The natural imbecillity of my body, join'd now to this acquir'd old age of the mind, makes me at lea&s;t as old as you, and we are the fitter to crawl down the hill together: I only de&s;ire I may be able to keep pace with you. My fir&s;t friend&s;hip at &s;ixteen, was contracted with a man of &s;eventy, and I found him not grave enough or con&s;i&s;tent enough for me, tho' we lived well to his death. I &s;peak of old Mr. Whcherly; &s;ome letters of whom (by the by) and of mine, the Book&s;ellers have got and printed, not without the concurrence of a no|ble friend of mine and yours <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">See the occa&s;ion, in the &s;econd and third Paragraphs of the Preface to the fir&s;t Volume of Letters. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>. I don't much approve of it; tho' there is nothing for me to be a&s;ham'd of, becau&s;e I will not be a&s;ham'd of any thing I do not do my&s;elf, or of any thing that is not immoral but merely dull (as for in&s;tance, if they printed this letter I am now writing, which they ea&s;ily may, if the un|derlings at the Po&s;t-office plea&s;e to take a copy of it.) I admire on this con&s;ideration, your &s;end|ing your la&s;t to me quite open, without a &s;eal, wafer, or any clo&s;ure whatever, manife&s;ting the utter openne&s;s of the writer. I would do the &s;ame by this, but fear it would look like affec|tation to &s;end two letters &s;o together.&mdash;I will fully repre&s;ent to our friend (and, I doubt not, it

He is an extreme hone&s;t man, and indeed ought to be &s;o, con&s;idering how very indi&s;creet and unre&s;erved he is: But I do not approve this part of his character, and will never join with him in any of his idlene&s;&s;es in the way of wit. You know my maxim to keep as clear of all offence, as I am clear of all intere&s;t in either party. I was once di&s;pleas'd before at you, for complaining to Mr. * of my not having a pen&s;ion, and am &s;o again at your naming it to a certain Lord. I have given proof in the cour&s;e of my whole life, (from the time when I was in the friend&s;hip of Lord Bolingbroke and Mr. Craggs, even to this when I am civilly treated by Sir R. Walpole) that I never thought my&s;elf &s;o warm in any Party's cau&s;e as to de&s;erve their money; and therefore would never have accepted it: But give me leave to tell you, that of all mankind the two per&s;ons I would lea&s;t have accepted any favour from, are tho&s;e very two, to whom you have unluckily &s;poken of it. I de&s;ire you to take off any impre&s;&s;ions which that dialogue may have left on his Lord&s;hip's mind, as if I ever had any thought of being beholden to him, or any other, in that way. And yet, you know I am no enemy to the pre&s;ent Con&s;titution; I believe, as &s;incere a well-wi&s;her to it, nay, even

<P>Lord B's an&s;wer to your letter I have ju&s;t re|ceiv'd, and join it to this pacquet. The work he &s;peaks of with &s;uch abundant partiality, is a &s;y&s;tem of Ethics in the Horatian way.</P>

<P>THIS is a letter extraordinary, to do and &s;ay nothing but recommend to you (as a Clergyman, and a charitable one) a pious and a good work, and for a good and an hone&s;t man: Moreover he is above &s;eventy, and poor, which you might think included in the word hone&s;t. I &s;hall think it a kindne&s;s done my|&s;elf; if you can propagate Mr. We&s;tley's &s;ub|&s;cription for his Commentary on Job, among your Divines, (Bi&s;hops excepted, of whom there is no hope) and among &s;uch as are be|lievers, or readers, of Scripture.

may find &s;omething to plea&s;e them, if they &s;corn to be edified. It has been the la|bour of eight years of this learned man's life; I call him what he is, a learned man, and I engage you will approve his pro&s;e more than you formerly could his poetry. Lord Boling|broke is a favourer of it, and allows you to do your be&s;t to &s;erve an old Tory, and a &s;ufferer for the Church of England, tho' you are a Whig, as I am.</P>
<P>We have here &s;ome ver&s;es in your name, which I am angry at. Sure you wou'd not u&s;e me &s;o ill as to flatter me? I therefore think it is &s;ome other weak Iri&s;hman.</P>

<P>P. S. I did not take the pen out of Pope's hands, I prote&s;t to you. But &s;ince he will not fill the remainder of the page, I think I may without offence. I &s;eek no epi&s;tolary fame, but am a good deal plea&s;ed to think that it will be known hereafter that you and I lived in the mo&s;t friendly intimacy together.&mdash;Pliny writ his letters for the public, &s;o did Seneca, &s;o did Bal&s;ac, Voiture, &amp;c. Tully did not, and there|fore the&s;e give us more plea&s;ure than any which have come down to us from antiquity. When we read them, we pry into a &s;ecret which was intended to be kept from us. That is a plea|&s;ure. We &s;ee Cato, and Brutus, and Pompey,
<PB N="161" REF="179">
and others, &s;uch as they really were, and not &s;uch as the gaping multitude of their own age took them to be, or as Hi&s;torians and Poets have repre&s;ented them to ours. That is another plea&s;ure. I remember to have &s;een a proce&s;&s;ion at <HI>Aix la Chapelle,</HI> wherein an image of Charle|magne is carried on the &s;houlders of a man, who is hid by the long robe of the imperial Saint. Follow him into the ve&s;try, you &s;ee the bearer &s;lip from under the robe, and the gigan|tic figure dwindles into an image of the ordina|ry &s;ize, and is &s;et by among other lumber&mdash;I agree much with Pope, that our climate is ra|ther better than that you are in, and perhaps your public &s;pirit would be le&s;s grieved, or oft|ner comforted, here than there. Come to us therefore on a vi&s;it at lea&s;t. It will not be the fault of &s;everal per&s;ons here, if you do not come to live with us. But great good-will and little power produce &s;uch &s;low and feeble effects as can be acceptable to heaven alone, and heaven|ly men.&mdash;I know you will be angry with me, if I &s;ay nothing to you of a poor woman, who is &s;till on the other &s;ide of the water in a mo&s;t langui&s;hing &s;tate of health. If &s;he regains &s;trength enough to come over, (and &s;he is bet|ter within a few weeks) I &s;hall nur&s;e her in this farm with all the care and tenderne&s;s po&s;|&s;ible.

<P>I Begin my Letter by telling you that my wife has been returned from abroad about a month, and that her health, tho' feeble and precarious, is better than it has been the&s;e two years. She is much your &s;ervant, and as &s;he has been her own phy&s;ician with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s, imagines &s;he could be yours with the &s;ame. Would to God you was within her reach. She would, I believe, pre&s;cribe a great deal of the <HI>medicina animi,</HI> without having recour&s;e to the Books of Tri&s;megi&s;tus. Pope and I &s;hould be her principal apothecaries in the cour&s;e of the cure; and tho' our be&s;t Botani&s;ts complain, that few of the herbs and &s;imples which go to the compo&s;ition of the&s;e remedies, are to be found at pre&s;ent in our &s;oil, yet there are more of them here than in Ireland; be&s;ides, by the help of a little chemi&s;try the mo&s;t noxious

juices may become &s;alubrious, and rank poi&s;on a &s;pecific.&mdash;Pope is now in my library with me, and writes to the world, to the pre&s;ent and to future ages, whil&s;t I begin this letter which he is to fini&s;h to you. What good he will do to mankind I know not; this comfort he may be &s;ure of, he cannot do le&s;s than you have done before him. I have &s;ometimes thought, that if preachers, hangmen, and moral-writers keep vice at a &s;tand, or &s;o much as retard the progre&s;s of it, they do as much as human na|ture admits: a real reformation is not to be brought about by ordinary means; it requires tho&s;e extraordinary means which become pu|ni&s;hments as well as le&s;&s;ons: National corrup|tion mu&s;t be purged by national calamities.&mdash;Let us hear from you. We de&s;erve this atten|tion, becau&s;e we de&s;ire it, and becau&s;e we be|lieve that you de&s;ire to hear from us.</P>

<P>I Have delayed &s;everal po&s;ts an&s;wering your letter of January la&s;t, in hopes of being a|ble to &s;peak to you about a project which con|cerns
<PB N="164" REF="182">
us both, but me the mo&s;t, &s;ince the &s;uc|ce&s;s of it would bring us together. It has been a good while in my head, and at my heart; if it can be &s;et a going, you &s;hall hear more of it. I was ill in the beginning of the winter for near a week, but in no danger either from the na|ture of my di&s;temper, or from the attendance of three phy&s;icians. Since that bilious inter|mitting feaver, I have had, as I had before, better health than the regard I have payed to health de&s;erves. We are both in the decline of life, my dear Dean, and have been &s;ome years going down the hill; let us make the pa&s;|&s;age as &s;mooth as we can. Let us fence again&s;t phy&s;ical evil by care, and the u&s;e of tho&s;e means which experience mu&s;t have pointed out to us: Let us fence again&s;t moral evil by philo&s;ophy. I renounce the alternative you propo&s;e. But we may, nay (if we will follow nature, and do not work up imagination again&s;t her plaine&s;t dic|tates) we &s;hall of cour&s;e grow every year more indifferent to life, and to the affairs and intere&s;ts of a &s;y&s;tem out of which we are &s;oon to go. This is much better than &s;tupidity. The decay of pa&s;&s;ion &s;trengthens philo&s;ophy, for pa&s;&s;ion may decay, and &s;tupidity not &s;ucceed. <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> (&s;ays Pope, our Divine, as you will &s;ee one time or other) are the <HI>Gales</HI> of life: Let us not com|plain that they do not blow a &s;torm. What
<PB N="165" REF="183">
hurt does age do us, in &s;ubduing what we toil to &s;ubdue all our lives? It is now &s;ix in the morning: I recall the time (and am glad it is over) when about this hour I u&s;ed to be going to bed, &s;urfeited with plea&s;ure, or jaded with bu&s;ine&s;s: my head often full of &s;chemes, and my heart as often full of anxiety. Is it a mi&s;|fortune, think you, that I ri&s;e at this hour, re|fre&s;hed, &s;erene, and calm? that the pa&s;t, and even the pre&s;ent affairs of life &s;tand like objects at a di&s;tance from me, where I can keep off the di&s;agreeable &s;o as not to be &s;trongly affected by them, and from whence I can draw the others nearer to me? Pa&s;&s;ions in their force, would bring all the&s;e, nay even future contingencies, about my ears at once, and Rea&s;on would but ill defend me in the &s;cuffle.</P>
<P>I leave Pope to &s;peak for him&s;elf, but I mu&s;t tell you how much my Wife is obliged to you. She &s;ays &s;he would find &s;trength enough to nur&s;e you, if you was here, and yet, God knows, &s;he is extremely weak: The &s;low fever works un|der, and mines the con&s;titution; we keep it off &s;ometimes, but &s;till it returns, and makes new breaches before nature can repair the old ones. I am not a&s;hamed to &s;ay to you, that I admire her more every hour of my life: Death is not to her the King of Terrors; &s;he beholds him without the lea&s;t. When &s;he &s;uffers much, &s;he
<PB N="166" REF="184">
wi&s;hes for him as a deliverer from pain; when life is tolerable, &s;he looks on him with di&s;like, becau&s;e he is to &s;eparate her from tho&s;e friends to whom &s;he is more attached than to life it&s;elf.&mdash;You &s;hall not &s;tay for my next, as long as you have for this letter; and in every one, Pope &s;hall write &s;omething much better than the &s;craps of old Philo&s;ophers, which were the pre&s;ents, Munu&s;cula, that Stoical Fop Seneca u&s;ed to &s;end in every Epi&s;tle to his friend Lucilius.</P>

<P>P. S. My Lord has &s;poken ju&s;tly of his La|dy: why not I of my Mother? Ye&s;terday was her birth-day, now entering on the ninety-fir&s;t year of her age; her memory much dimini&s;h'd, but her &s;en&s;es very little hurt, her &s;ight and hearing good; &s;he &s;leeps not ill, eats moderate|ly, drinks water, &s;ays her prayers; this is all &s;he does. I have rea&s;on to thank God for con|tinuing &s;o long to me a very good and tender parent, and for allowing me to exerci&s;e for &s;ome years, tho&s;e cares which are now as nece&s;&s;ary to her, as hers have been to me. An object of this &s;ort daily before one's eyes very much &s;oft|ens the mind, but perhaps may hinder it from the willingne&s;s of contracting other tyes of the like dome&s;tic nature, when one finds how pain|ful it is even to enjoy the tender plea&s;ures.

<P>YOU may a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf, that, if you come over this &s;pring, you will find me not on|ly got back into the habits of &s;tudy, but de|voted to that hi&s;torical ta&s;k, which you have
<PB N="168" REF="186">
&s;et me the&s;e many years. I am in hopes of &s;ome materials which will enable me to work in the whole extent of the plan I propo&s;e to my&s;elf. If they are not to be had, I mu&s;t accommodate my plan to this deficiency. In the mean time Pope has given me more trouble than he or I thought of; and you will be &s;urprized to find that I have been partly drawn by him and part|ly by my&s;elf, to write a pretty large volume upon a very grave and very important &s;ubject; that I have ventur'd to pay no regard whatever to any authority except &s;acred authority, and that I have ventured to &s;tart a thought, which mu&s;t, if it is pu&s;h'd as &s;ucce&s;sfully as I think it is, render all your Metaphy&s;ical Theology both ridiculous and abominable. There is an expre&s;&s;ion in one of your letters to me, which makes me believe you will come into my way of thinking on this &s;ubject; and yet I am per|&s;waded that Divines and Freethinkers would both be clamorous again&s;t it, if it was to be &s;ubmitted to their cen&s;ure, as I do not intend that it &s;hall. The pa&s;&s;age I mean, is that where you &s;ay that you told Dr. * the Grand points of Chri&s;tianity ought to be taken as infallible Revelations <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">In this maxim all bigot|ted <HI>Divines</HI> and <HI>free-thinking</HI> Politicians agree: the one, for fear of di&s;turbing the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed Religion; the other, le&s;t that di&s;turbance &s;hould prove injurious to their admi|ni&s;tration of government.</NOTE>, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="187" MS="Y">
It has happened, that, whil&s;t I was writing this to you, the Dr. came to make me a vi&s;it from London, where I heard he was arrived &s;ome time ago: He was in ha&s;te to return, and is, I perceive, in great ha&s;te to print. He left with me eight Di&s;&s;ertations <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Revelation examined with candor.</NOTE>, a &s;mall part, as I under&s;tand, of his work, and de&s;ired me to peru&s;e, con&s;ider, and ob&s;erve upon them again&s;t monday next, when he will come down again. By what I have read of the two fir&s;t, I find my|&s;elf unable to &s;erve him. The principles he rea&s;ons upon are begged in a di&s;putation of this &s;ort, and the manner of rea&s;oning is by no means clo&s;e and conclu&s;ive. The &s;ole advice I could give him in con&s;cience would be that which he would take ill and not follow. I will get rid of this ta&s;k as well as I can, for I e&s;teem the man, and &s;hould be &s;orry to di&s;oblige him where I cannot &s;erve him.</P>
<P>As to retirement, and exerci&s;e, your notions are true: The fir&s;t &s;hould not be indulged &s;o much as to render us &s;avage, nor the la&s;t neg|lected &s;o as to impair health. But I know men, who, for fear of being &s;avage, live with all who will live with them; and who, to pre&s;erve their health, &s;aunter away half their time. Adieu: Pope calls for the paper.</P>

<P>P. S. I hope what goes before will be a &s;trong motive to your coming. God knows if ever I &s;hall &s;ee Ireland; I &s;hall never de&s;ire it, if you can be got hither, or kept here. Yet I think I &s;hall be, too &s;oon, a Free-man.&mdash;Your recommendations I con&s;tantly give to tho&s;e you mention; tho' &s;ome of 'em I &s;ee but &s;eldom, and am every day more retired. I am le&s;s fond of the world, and le&s;s curious about it: yet no way out of humour, di&s;appointed, or angry: tho' in my way I receive as many injuries as my betters, but I don't feel them, therefore I ought not to vex other people, nor even to re|turn injuries. I pa&s;s almo&s;t all my time at Dawley and at home; my Lord (of which I partly take the merit to my&s;elf) is as much e&s;tranged from politics as I am. Let Philo&s;o|phy be ever &s;o vain, it is le&s;s vain now than Politics, and not quite &s;o vain at pre&s;ent as Di|vinity: I know nothing that moves &s;trongly but Satire, and tho&s;e who are a&s;ham'd of nothing el&s;e, are &s;o of being ridiculous. I fancy, if we three were together but for three years, &s;ome good might be done even upon this Age.</P>
<P>I know you'll de&s;ire &s;ome account of my health: It is as u&s;ual, but my &s;pirits rather wor&s;e. I write little or nothing. You know I never had either a ta&s;te or talent for politics, and the world minds nothing el&s;e. I have per|&s;onal

obligations which I will ever pre&s;erve, to men of different &s;ides, and I wi&s;h nothing &s;o much as public quiet, except it be my own quiet.

<P>I Deny it. I do write to you according to the old &s;tipulation, for, when you kept your old company, when I writ to one I writ to all. But I am ready to enter into a new bargain &s;ince you are got into a new world, and will an&s;wer all your letters. You are fir&s;t to pre&s;ent my mo&s;t humble re&s;pects to the Duche&s;s of Queen&s;bury, and let her know that I never dine without thinking of her, although it be with &s;ome dif|ficulty
<PB N="173" REF="191">
that I can obey her when I dine with forks that have but two prongs, and when the &s;auce is not very con&s;i&s;tent. You mu&s;t likewi&s;e tell her Grace that &s;he is a general Toa&s;t among all hone&s;t folks here, and particularly at the Deanery, even in the face of my Whig &s;ub|jects.&mdash;I will leave my money in Lord Ba|thur&s;t's hands, and the management of it (for want of better) in yours: and pray keep the intere&s;t-mony in a bag wrapt up and &s;ealed by it&s;elf, for fear of your own fingers under your carele&s;&s;ne&s;s. Mr. Pope talks of you as a per|fect &s;tranger; but the different pur&s;uits and manners and intere&s;ts of life, as fortune hath plea&s;ed to di&s;po&s;e them, will never &s;uffer tho&s;e to live together, who by their inclinations ought never to part. I hope when you are rich enough, you will have &s;ome little oecono|my of your own in town or country, and be able to give your friend a pint of Port; for the dome&s;tic &s;ea&s;on of life will come on. I had never much hopes of your vampt Play, al|though Mr. Pope &s;eem'd to have, and although it were ever &s;o good: But you &s;hould have done like the Par&s;ons, and changed your Text, I mean the Title, and the names of the per&s;ons.

<P>WHEN my Lord Peterborow in the Queen's time went abroad upon his Amba&s;&s;ies, the Mini&s;try told me, that he was &s;uch a vagrant, they were forced to write <HI>at</HI> him by gue&s;s, becau&s;e they knew not where to write <HI>to</HI> him. This is my ca&s;e with you; &s;ometimes in Scotland, &s;ometimes at Ham|walks, &s;ometimes God knows where. You are a man of bu&s;ine&s;s, and not at lei&s;ure for in&s;ig|nificant corre&s;pondence. It was I got you the employment of being my Lord Duke's <HI>premier Mini&s;tre:</HI> for his Grace having heard how good a manager you were of my revenue, thought you fit to be entru&s;ted with ten talents. I have had twenty times a &s;trong inclination to &s;pend a &s;ummer near Sali&s;bury-downs, having rode
<PB N="175" REF="193">
over them more than once, and with a young par&s;on of Sali&s;bury reckoned twice the &s;tones of Stonehenge, which are either ninety-two or ninety-three. I de&s;ire to pre&s;ent my mo&s;t humble acknowledgements to my Lady Duche&s;s in return of her civility. I hear an ill thing, that &s;he is <HI>matre pulchra filia pulchrior:</HI> I never &s;aw her &s;ince &s;he was a girl, and would be an|gry &s;he &s;hould excel her mother, who was long my principal Godde&s;s. I de&s;ire you will tell her Grace, that the ill management of forks is not to be help'd when they are only bidential, which happens in all poor hou&s;es, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of Poets; upon which account a knife was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary at Mr. Pope's, where it was morally impo&s;&s;ible with a bidential fork to convey a mor&s;el of beef, with the incum|brance of mu&s;tard and turnips, into your mouth at once. And her Grace hath co&s;t me thirty pounds to provide Tridents for fear of offend|ing her, which &s;um I de&s;ire &s;he will plea&s;e to return me.&mdash;I am &s;ick enough to go to the Bath, but have not heard it will be good for my di&s;order. I have a &s;trong mind to &s;pend my 200<HI>l.</HI> next &s;ummer in France: I am glad I have it, for there is hardly twice that &s;um left in this kingdom. You want no &s;ettlement (I call the family where you live, and the foot you are upon, a &s;ettlement) till you increa&s;e
<PB N="176" REF="194">
your fortune to what will &s;upport you with ea&s;e and plenty, a good hou&s;e and a garden. The want of this I much dread for you: For I have often known a She-cou&s;in of a good family and &s;mall fortune, pa&s;&s;ing months among all her relations, living in plenty, and taking her circles, till &s;he grew an old Maid, and every body weary of her. Mr. Pope complains of &s;eldom &s;eeing you; but the evil is unavoidable, for different circum&s;tances of life have always &s;eparated tho&s;e whom friend&s;hip would join: God hath taken care of this, to prevent any progre&s;s towards real happine&s;s here, which would make life more de&s;irable, and death too dreadful. I hope you have now one advantage that you always wanted before, and the want of which made your friends as unea&s;y as it did your&s;elf; I mean the removal of that &s;olicitude about your own affairs, which perpetually fill'd your thoughts and di&s;turb'd your conver&s;ation. For if it be true what Mr. Pope &s;eriou&s;ly tells me, you will have opportunity of &s;aving every groat of the intere&s;t you receive; and &s;o by the time he and you grow weary of each other, you will be able to pa&s;s the re&s;t of your wine|le&s;s life, in ea&s;e and plenty, with the addition|al triumphal comfort of never having receiv'd a penny from tho&s;e ta&s;tele&s;s ungrateful people from whom you de&s;erved &s;o much, and who

<P>I Writ to you a long letter about a fortnight pa&s;t concluding you were in London, from whence I under&s;tood one of your former was dated: Nor did I imagine you were gone back to Aim&s;bury &s;o late in the year, at which &s;ea&s;on I take the Country to be only a &s;cene for tho&s;e who have been ill u&s;ed by a Court on account of their Virtues; which is a &s;tate of happine&s;s the more valuable, becau&s;e it is not accompa|nied by Envy, although nothing de&s;erves it more. I would gladly &s;ell a Dukedom to lo&s;e favour in the manner their Graces have done. I believe my Lord Carteret, &s;ince he is no
<PB N="178" REF="196" MS="Y">
longer Lieutenant, may not wi&s;h me ill, and I have told him often that I only hated him as Lieutenant: I confe&s;s he had a genteeler man|ner of binding the chains of this kingdom than mo&s;t of his predece&s;&s;ors, and I confe&s;s at the &s;ame time that he had, &s;ix times, a regard to my recommendation by preferring &s;o many of my friends in the church; the two la&s;t acts of his favour were to add to the dignities of Dr. Delany and Mr. Stopford, the la&s;t of whom was by you and Mr. Pope put into Mr. Pult|ney's hands. I told you in my la&s;t, that a con|tinuance of giddine&s;s (tho' not in a violent de|gree) prevented my thoughts of England at pre&s;ent. For in my ca&s;e a dome&s;tic life is ne|ce&s;&s;ary, where I can with the Centurion &s;ay to my &s;ervant, Go, and he goeth, and Do this, and he doth it. I now hate all people whom I cannot command, and con&s;equently a Duche&s;s is at this the hatefulle&s;t Lady in the world to me, one only excepted, and I beg her Grace's pardon for that exception, for, in the way I mean, her Grace is ten thou&s;and times more hateful. I confe&s;s I begin to apprehend you will &s;quander my money, becau&s;e I hope you never le&s;s wanted it; and if you go on with &s;ucce&s;s for two years longer, I fear I &s;hall not have a far|thing of it left. The Doctor hath ill-informed me, who &s;ays that Mr. Pope is at pre&s;ent the
<PB N="179" REF="197">
chief Poetical Favourite, yet Mr. Pope him&s;elf talks like a Philo&s;opher and one wholly retir'd. But the vogue of our &s;ew hone&s;t folks here is, that Duck is ab&s;olutely to &s;ucceed Eu&s;den in the laurel, the contention being between Concannen or Theobald, or &s;ome other Hero of the Dun|ciad. I never charged you for not talking, but the dubious &s;tate of your affairs in tho&s;e days was too much the &s;ubject, and I wi&s;h the Du|che&s;s had been the voucher of your amendment. Nothing &s;o much contributed to my ea&s;e as the turn of affairs after the Queen's death; by which all my hopes being cut off, I could have no Ambition left, unle&s;s I would have been a greater ra&s;cal than happened to &s;uit with my temper. I therefore &s;at down quietly at my mor&s;el, adding only thereto a principle of ha|tred to all &s;ucceeding Mea&s;ures and Mini&s;tries by way of &s;auce to reli&s;h my meat: And I con|fe&s;s one point of conduct in my Lady Duche&s;s's life hath added much poignancy to it. There is a good Iri&s;h practical bull towards the end of your letter, where you &s;pend a dozen lines in telling me you mu&s;t leave off, that you may give my Lady Duche&s;s room to write, and &s;o you proceed to within two or three lines of the bottom; though I would have remitted you my 200 <HI>l.</HI> to have left place for as many more.</P>

<P>My beginning thus low is meant as a mark of re&s;pect, like receiving your Grace at the bot|tom of the &s;tairs. I am glad you know your duty; for it hath been a known and e&s;tabli&s;h'd rule above twenty years in England, that the fir&s;t advances have been con&s;tantly made me by all Ladies who a&s;pir'd to my acquaintance, and the greater their quality, the greater were their advances. Yet, I know not by what weakne&s;s, I have conde&s;cended graciou&s;ly to di&s;pen&s;e with you upon this important article. Though Mr. Gay will tell you that a namele&s;s per&s;on &s;ent me eleven me&s;&s;ages before I would yield to a vi&s;it: I mean a per&s;on to whom he is infinite|ly obliged, for being the occa&s;ion of the hap|pine&s;s he now enjoys under the protection and favour of my Lord Duke and your Grace. At the &s;ame time, I cannot forbear telling you, Madam, that you are a little imperious in your manner of making your advances. You &s;ay, perhaps you &s;hall not like me; I affirm you are mi&s;taken, which I can plainly demon&s;trate; for I have certain intelligence, that another per|&s;on di&s;likes me of late, with who&s;e likings yours have not for &s;ome time pa&s;t gone toge|ther
<PB N="181" REF="199">
However, if I &s;hall once have the ho|nour to attend your Grace, I will out of fear and prudence appear as vain as I can, that I may not know your thoughts of me. This is your own direction, but it was needle&s;s: For Diogenes him&s;elf would be vain, to have re|ceiv'd the honour of being one moment of his life in the thoughts of your Grace.</P>

<P>YOUR &s;ituation is an odd one; the Du|che&s;s is your Trea&s;urer, and Mr. Pope tells me you are the Duke's. And I had gone a good way in &s;ome Ver&s;es on that occa&s;ion, pre&s;cribing le&s;&s;ons to direct your conduct, in a negative way, not to do &s;o and &s;o, &amp;c. like other Trea&s;urers; how to deal with Servants, Tenants, or neighbouring Squires, which I take to be Courtiers, Parliaments, and Princes in alliance, and &s;o the parallel goes on, but grows too long to plea&s;e me: I prove that Poets are the fitte&s;t per&s;ons to be trea&s;urers and managers to great per&s;ons, from their virtue, and con|tempt of money, &amp;c.&mdash;Pray, why did you not get a new heel to your &s;hoe? unle&s;s you would make your court at St. James's by affecting to
<PB N="182" REF="200">
imitate the Prince of Lilliput.&mdash;But the re&s;t of your letter being wholly taken up in a very bad character of the Duche&s;s, I &s;hall &s;ay no more to you, but apply my&s;elf to her Grace.</P>
<P>Madam, &s;ince Mr. Gay affirms that you love to have your own way, and &s;ince I have the &s;ame perfection; I will &s;ettle that matter im|mediately, to prevent tho&s;e ill con&s;equences he apprehends. Your Grace &s;hall have your own way, in all places except your own hou&s;e, and the domains about it. There and there only, I expect to have mine, &s;o that you have all the world to reign in, bating only two or three hun|dred acres, and two or three hou&s;es in town and country. I will likewi&s;e, out of my &s;pecial grace, certain knowledge, and mere motion, allow you to be in the right again&s;t all human kind, except my&s;elf, and to be never in the wrong but when you differ from me. You &s;hall have a greater privilege in the third article of &s;peaking your mind; which I &s;hall graciou&s;ly allow you now and then to do even to my&s;elf, and only rebuke you when it does not plea&s;e me.</P>
<P>Madam, I am now got as far as your Grace's letter, which having not read this fortnight (having been out of town, and not daring to tru&s;t my&s;elf with the carriage of it) the pre|&s;umptuous manner in which you begin had
<PB N="183" REF="201">
&s;lipt out of my memory. But I forgive you to the &s;eventeenth line, where you begin to bani&s;h me for ever, by demanding me to an&s;wer all the good Character &s;ome partial friends have given me. Madam, I have lived &s;ixteen years in Ireland, with only an intermi&s;&s;ion of two &s;ummers in England; and con&s;equently am fifty years older than I was at the Queen's death, and fifty-thou&s;and times duller, and fifty-mil|lion times more peevi&s;h, perver&s;e, and moro&s;e; &s;o that under the&s;e di&s;advantages I can only pre|tend to excel all your other acquaintance about &s;ome twenty barrs length. Pray, Madam, have you a clear voice? and will you let me &s;it at your left hand at lea&s;t within three of you, for of two bad ears, my right is the be&s;t? My Groom tells me that he likes your park, but your hou&s;e is too little. Can the Par&s;on of the pari&s;h play at back-gammon, and hold his tongue? is any one of your Women a good nur&s;e, if I &s;hould fancy my&s;elf &s;ick for four and twenty hours? how many days will you main|tain me and my equipage? When the&s;e preli|minaries are &s;ettled, I mu&s;t be very poor, very &s;ick, or dead, or to the la&s;t degree unfortunate, if I do not attend you at Aim&s;bury. For, I pro|fe&s;s, you are the fir&s;t Lady that ever I de&s;ired to &s;ee, &s;ince the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t 1714, and I have forgot the date when that de&s;ire grew &s;trong up|on
<PB N="184" REF="202">
me, but I know I was not then in England, el&s;e I would have gone on foot for that happine&s;s as far as to your hou&s;e in Scotland. But I can &s;oon re|collect the time, by a&s;king &s;ome Ladies here the month, the day, and the hour when I began to endure their company? which however I think was a &s;ign of my ill judgment, for I do not per|ceive they mend in any thing but envying or admiring your Grace. I di&s;like nothing in your letter but an affected apology for bad writing, bad &s;pelling, and a bad pen, which you pre|tend Mr. Gay found fault with; wherein you affront Mr. Gay, you affront me, and you af|front your&s;elf. Fal&s;e &s;pelling is only excu&s;able in a Chamber-maid, for I would not pardon it in any of your Waiting-women.&mdash;Pray God pre&s;erve your Grace and family, and give me leave to expect that you will be &s;o ju&s;t to re|member me among tho&s;e who have the great|e&s;t regard for virtue, goodne&s;s, prudence, cou|rage and genero&s;ity; after which you mu&s;t conclude that I am with the greate&s;t re&s;pect and gratitude, Madam, your Grace's mo&s;t obe|dient and mo&s;t humble &s;ervant, &amp;c.</P>

<P>EVER &s;ince I received your letter, I have been upon a balance about going to Eng|land, and landing at Bri&s;tol, to pa&s;s a month at Aim&s;bury, as the Duche&s;s hath given me leave. But many difficulties have interfered; fir&s;t, I thought I had done with my law-&s;uit, and &s;o did all my lawyers, but my adver&s;ary, after being in appearance a Prote&s;tant the&s;e twenty years, hath declared he was always a Papi&s;t, and con&s;equently by the law here, cannot buy nor (I think) &s;ell; &s;o that I am at &s;ea a|gain, for almo&s;t all I am worth. But I have &s;till a wor&s;e evil; for the giddine&s;s I was &s;ub|ject to, in&s;tead of coming &s;eldom and violent, now con&s;tantly attends me more or le&s;s, tho' in a more peaceable manner, yet &s;uch as will not qualify me to live among the young and healthy: and the Duche&s;s, in all her youth, &s;pi|rit,
<PB N="186" REF="204">
and grandeur, will make a very ill nur&s;e, and her women not much better. Valetudina|rians mu&s;t live where they can command, and &s;cold; I mu&s;t have hor&s;es to ride, I mu&s;t go to bed and ri&s;e when I plea&s;e, and live where all mortals are &s;ub&s;ervient to me. I mu&s;t talk non|&s;en&s;e when I plea&s;e, and all who are pre&s;ent mu&s;t commend it. I mu&s;t ride thrice a week, and walk three or four miles be&s;ides, every day.</P>
<P>I always told you Mr.&mdash;was good for nothing but to be a rank Courtier. I care not whether he ever writes to me or no. He and you may tell this to the Duche&s;s, and I hate to &s;ee you &s;o charitable, and &s;uch a Cully; and yet I love you for it, becau&s;e I am one my|&s;elf.</P>
<P>You are the &s;illie&s;t lover in Chri&s;tendom: If you like Mrs.&mdash;why do you not command her to take you? if &s;he does not, &s;he is not worth pur&s;uing; you do her too much honour; &s;he hath neither &s;en&s;e nor ta&s;te, if &s;he dares to refu&s;e you, though &s;he had ten thou&s;and pounds. I do not remember to have told you of thanks that you have not given, nor do I under&s;tand your meaning, and I am &s;ure I had never the lea&s;t thoughts of any my&s;elf. If I am your friend, it is for my own reputation, and from a prin|ciple of &s;elf-love, and I do &s;ometimes reproach
<PB N="187" REF="205">
you for not honouring me by letting the world know we are friends.</P>
<P>I &s;ee very well how matters go with the Du|che&s;s in regard to me. I heard her &s;ay, Mr. Gay, fill your letter to the Dean, that there may be no room for me, the frolic is gone far enough, I have writ thrice, I will do no more; if the man has a mind to come, let him come; what a clutter is here? po&s;itively I will not write a &s;yllable more. She is an ungrateful Duche&s;s con&s;idering how many adorers I have procured her here, over and above the thou|&s;ands &s;he had before.&mdash;I cannot allow you rich enough till you are worth 7000 <HI>l.</HI> which will bring you 300 <HI>per Annum,</HI> and this will main|tain you, with the perqui&s;ite of &s;punging while you are young, and when you are old will af|ford you a pint of port at night, two &s;ervants, and an old maid, a little garden, and pen and ink&mdash;provided you live in the country&mdash;Have you no &s;cheme either in ver&s;e or pro&s;e? The Duche&s;s &s;hould keep you at hard meat, and by that means force you to write; and &s;o I have done with you.</P>

<P>Since I began to grow old, I have found all ladies become incon&s;tant, without any reproach from their con&s;cience. If I wait on you, I de|clare

that one of your women (which ever it is that has de&s;igns upon a Chaplain) mu&s;t be my nur&s;e, if I happen to be &s;ick or peevi&s;h at your hou&s;e, and in that ca&s;e you mu&s;t &s;u&s;pend your domineering-Claim till I recover. Your omitting the u&s;ual appendix to Mr. Gay's let|ters hath done me infinite mi&s;chief here; for while you continued them, you would wonder how civil the Ladies here were to me, and how much they have altered &s;ince. I dare not con|fe&s;s that I have de&s;cended &s;o low as to write to your Grace, after the abominable neglect you have been guilty of; for if they but &s;u&s;pected it, I &s;hould lo&s;e them all. One of them, who had an inklin of the matter (your Grace will hardly believe it) refu&s;ed to beg my pardon up|on her knees, for once neglecting to make my rice-milk.&mdash;Pray, con&s;ider this, and do your duty, or dread the con&s;equence. I promi&s;e you &s;hall have your will &s;ix minutes every hour at Aim&s;bury, and &s;even in London, while I am in health: but if I happen to be &s;ick, I mu&s;t govern to a &s;econd.

<P>YOU and the Duche&s;s u&s;e me very ill, for, I profe&s;s, I cannot di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;tyle or the hand-writing of either. I think her Grace writes more like you than her&s;elf, and that you write more like her Grace than your&s;elf. I would &s;wear the beginning of your letter writ by the Duche&s;s, though it is to pa&s;s for yours; becau&s;e there is a cur&s;ed lie in it, that &s;he is neither young nor healthy, and be&s;ides it per|fectly re&s;embles the part &s;he owns. I will like|wi&s;e &s;wear, that what I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e is written by the Duche&s;s, is your hand; and thus I am puzzled and perplexed between you, but I will go on in the innocency of my own heart. I am got eight miles from our famous metropo|lis, to a country Par&s;on's, to whom I lately gave a City-living, &s;uch as an Engli&s;h Chaplain would leap at. I retired hither for the public good, having two great works in hand: One to reduce the whole politene&s;s, wit, humour, and &s;tyle of England into a &s;hort &s;y&s;tem, for the u&s;e of all per&s;ons of quality, and particu|larly the maids of honour <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Wag&s;taff's Dialogues of Polite Conver&s;ation,</HI> publi&s;hed in his life time.</NOTE>. The other is of

almo&s;t equal importance; I may call it the Whole duty of &s;ervants, in about twenty &s;eve|ral &s;tations, from the &s;teward and waiting-woman down to the &s;cullion and pantry-boy <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">An imperfect thing of this kind, called <HI>Directions to &s;ervants in general,</HI> has been publi&s;hed &s;ince his death.</NOTE>.&mdash;I believe no mortal had ever &s;uch fair Invi|tations, as to be happy in the be&s;t company of England. I wi&s;h I had liberty to print your letter with my own comments upon it. There was a fellow in Ireland, who from a &s;hoe-boy grew to be &s;everal times one of the chief go|vernors, wholly illiterate, and with hardly com|mon &s;en&s;e: A Lord Lieutenant told the fir&s;t King George, that he was the greate&s;t &s;ubject he had in both kingdoms; and truly this cha|racter was gotten and pre&s;erved by his never ap|pearing in England, which was the only wi&s;e thing he ever did, except purcha&s;ing &s;ixteen thou&s;and pounds a year&mdash;Why, you need not &s;tare: it is ea&s;ily apply'd: I mu&s;t be ab&s;ent, in order to pre&s;erve my credit with her Grace&mdash;Lo here comes in the Duche&s;s again (I know her by her d d's; but am a fool for di&s;covering my Art) to defend her&s;elf again&s;t my conjec|ture of what &s;he &s;aid&mdash;Madam, I will imitate your Grace and write to you upon the &s;ame line. I own it is a ba&s;e un-romantic &s;pirit in me, to &s;u&s;pend the honour of waiting at your
<PB N="191" REF="209">
Grace's feet, till I can fini&s;h a paltry law-&s;uit. It concerns indeed almo&s;t all my whole for|tune; it is equal to half Mr. Pope's, and two thirds of Mr. Gay's, and about &s;ix weeks rent of your Grace's. This cur&s;ed accident hath drill'd away the whole &s;ummer. But, Madam, under&s;tand one thing, that I take all your iro|nical civilities in a literal &s;en&s;e, and whenever I have the honour to attend you, &s;hall expect them to be literally performed: though per|haps I &s;hall find it hard to prove your hand|writing in a Court of ju&s;tice; but that will not be much for your credit. How mi&s;erably hath your Grace been mi&s;taken in thinking to avoid Envy by running into exile, where it haunts you more than ever it did even at Court? <HI>Non te civitas, non Regia domus in exilium mi&s;erunt, &s;ed tu utra&s;que.</HI> So &s;ays Cicero (as your Grace knows) or &s;o he might have &s;aid.</P>
<P>I am told that the Craftsman in one of his papers is offended with the publi&s;hers of (I &s;up|po&s;e) the la&s;t edition of the Dunciad; and I was a&s;ked whether you and Mr. Pope were as good friends to the new di&s;graced per&s;on as for|merly? This I knew nothing of, but &s;uppo&s;e it was the con&s;equence of &s;ome mi&s;take. As to writing, I look on you ju&s;t in the prime of life for it, the very &s;ea&s;on when judgment and invention draw together. But &s;chemes are per|fectly
<PB N="192" REF="210">
accidental; &s;ome will appear barren of hints and matter, but prove to be fruitful; and others the contrary: And what you &s;ay, is pa&s;t doubt, that every one can be&s;t find hints for him&s;elf: though it is po&s;&s;ible that &s;ometimes a friend may give you a lucky one ju&s;t &s;uited to your own imagination. But all this is almo&s;t pa&s;t with me: my invention and judgment are perpetually at fi&s;ty-cuffs, till they have quite di&s;abled each other; and the meere&s;t trifles I ever wrote are &s;erious philo&s;ophical lucubra|tions, in compari&s;on to what I now bu&s;y my&s;elf about; as (to &s;peak in the author's phra&s;e) the world may one day &s;ee <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">His ludicrous prediction was, &s;ince his death, and very much to his di&s;honour, &s;eriou&s;ly fulfilled.</NOTE>.</P>

I have nothing to take me off from my friend&s;hip to you: I &s;eek no new acquaintance, and court no favour; I &s;pend no &s;hillings in coaches or chairs to levees or great vi&s;its, and, as I don't want the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome that I formerly convers'd with, I will not &s;o much as &s;eem to &s;eek to be a depend|ant. As to my &s;tudies, I have not been en|tirely idle, though I cannot &s;ay that I have yet perfected any thing. What I have done is &s;omething in the way of tho&s;e fables I have al|ready publi&s;h'd. All the money I get is by &s;av|ing, &s;o that by habit there may be &s;ome hopes (if I grow richer) of my becoming a mi&s;er. All
<PB N="198" REF="216">
mi&s;ers have their excu&s;es; the motive to my par&s;imony is independance. If I were to be repre&s;ented by the Duche&s;s (&s;he is &s;uch a down|right niggard for me) this character might not be allow'd me; but I really think I am cove|tous enough for any who lives at the court-end of the town, and who is as poor as my&s;elf: for I don't pretend that I am equally &s;aving with S&mdash;k. Mr. Lewis de&s;ired you might be told that he hath five pounds of yours in his hands, which he fancies you may have forgot, for he will hardly allow that a Ver&s;e-man can have a ju&s;t knowledge of his own affairs. When you got rid of your law-&s;uit, I was in hopes that you had got your own, and was free from every vexation of the law; but Mr. Pope tells me you are not entirely out of your perplexity, though you have the &s;ecurity now in your own po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion; but &s;till your ca&s;e is not &s;o bad as Cap|tain Gulliver's, who was ruined by having a de|cree for him with co&s;ts. I have had an injunc|tion for me again&s;t pirating-book&s;ellers, which I am &s;ure to get nothing by, and will, I fear, in the end drain me of &s;ome money. When I began this pro&s;ecution, I fancy'd there would be &s;ome end of it; but the law &s;till goes on, and 'tis probable I &s;hall &s;ome time or other &s;$e an Attorney's bill as long as the Book.

<P>You have the good wi&s;hes of tho&s;e I con|ver&s;e with; they know they gratify me, when they remember you; but I really think they do it purely for your own &s;ake.

<P>P. S.

<P>I Am now as lame as when you writ your letter, and almo&s;t as lame as your letter it|&s;elf, for want of that limb from my Lady Du|che&s;s, which you promis'd, and without which I wonder how it could limp hither. I am not in a condition to make a true &s;tep even on Aim&s;|bury Downs, and I declare that a corporeal fal&s;e &s;tep is wor&s;e than a political one; nay wor&s;e than a thou&s;and political ones, for which I ap|peal to Courts and Mini&s;ters, who hobble on and pro&s;per, without the &s;en&s;e of feeling. To talk of riding and walking is in&s;ulting me, for I can as &s;oon fly as do either. It is your pride
<PB N="203" REF="221">
or lazine&s;s, more than chair-hire, that makes the town expen&s;ive. No honour is lo&s;t by walking in the dark; and in the day, you may beckon a black-guard-boy under a gate, near your vi&s;iting place, <HI>(experto crede)</HI> &s;ave eleven pence, and get half a crown's worth of health. The wor&s;t of my pre&s;ent misfortune is, that I eat and drink, and can dige&s;t neither for want of exerci&s;e; and, to encrea&s;e my mi&s;ery, the knaves are &s;ure to find me at home, and make huge void &s;paces in my cellars. I congratulate with you, for lo&s;ing your Great acquaintance; in &s;uch a ca&s;e, philo&s;ophy teaches that we mu&s;t &s;ubmit, and be content with Good ones. I like Lord Cornbury's refu&s;ing his pen&s;ion, but I demur at his being elected for Oxford; which, I conceive, is wholly changed; and entirely de|voted to new principles; &s;o it appeared to me the two la&s;t times I was there.</P>
<P>I find by the whole ca&s;t of your letter, that you are as giddy and as volatile as ever, ju&s;t the rever&s;e pf Mr. Pope, who hath always loved a dome&s;tic life from his youth. I was going to wi&s;h you had &s;ome little place that you could call your own, but, I profe&s;s, I do not know you well enough to contrive any one &s;y&s;tem of life that would plea&s;e you. You pretend to preach up riding and walking to the Dutche&s;s, yet, from
my knowledge of you after twenty years, you
<PB N="204" REF="222">
always joined a violent de&s;ire of perpetually &s;hifting places and company, with a rooted la|zine&s;s, and an utter impatience of fatigue. A coach and &s;ix hor&s;es is the utmo&s;t exerci&s;e you can bear, and this only when you can fill it with &s;uch company as is be&s;t &s;uited to your ta&s;te, and how glad would you be if it could waft you in the air to avoid jolting? while I, who am &s;o much later in life, can, or at lea&s;t could, ride 500 miles on a trotting hor&s;e. You mortally hate writing, only becau&s;e it is the thing you chiefly ought to do; as well to keep up the vogue you have in the world, as to make you ea&s;y in your fortune: You are merciful to every thing but money, your be&s;t friend, whom you treat with inhumanity. Be a&s;&s;ured, I will hire people to watch all your motions, and to return me a faithful account. Tell me, have you cured your Ab&s;ence of mind? can you at|tend to trifles? can you at Aim&s;bury write do|me&s;tic libels to divert the family and neigh|bouring &s;quires for five miles round? or ven|ture &s;o far on hor&s;eback, without apprehend|ing a &s;tumble at every &s;tep? can you &s;et the foot-men a laughing as they wait at dinner? and do the Duche&s;s's women admire your wit? in what e&s;teem are you with the Vicar of the pari&s;h? can you play with him at back-gam|mon? have the farmers &s;ound out that you can|not

di&s;tingui&s;h rye from barley, or an oak from a crab-tree? You are &s;en&s;ible that I know the full extent of your country &s;kill is in fi&s;hing for Roaches, or Gudgeons at the highe&s;t.</P>
<P>I love to do you good offices with your friends, and therefore de&s;ire you will &s;how this letter to the $$che&s;s, to improve her Grace's good opinion of your qualifications, and con|vince her how u&s;eful you are like to be in the fa|mily. Her Grace &s;hall have the honour of my corre&s;pondence again when &s;he goes to Aim&s;|bury. Hear a piece of Iri&s;h news, I buried the famous General Meredyth's father la&s;t night in my Cathedral, he was ninety-&s;ix years old: &s;o that Mrs. Pope may live &s;even years longer. You &s;aw Mr. Pope in health, pray is he gene|rally more healthy than when I was among&s;t you? I would know how your own health is, and how much wine you drink in a day? My &s;tint in company is a pint at noon, and half as much at night, but I often dine at home like a hermit, and then I drink little or none at all. Yet I differ from you, for I would have &s;o|ciety, if I could get what I like, people of mid|dle under&s;tanding, and middle rank.</P>

<P>I Had your letter by Mr. Ryves a long time after the date, for I &s;uppo&s;e he &s;tayed long in the way. I am glad you determine upon &s;omething; there is no writing I e&s;teem more than Fables, nor any thing &s;o difficult to &s;uc|ceed in, which however you have done ex|cellently well, and I have often admir'd your happine&s;s in &s;uch a kind of performances which I have frequently endeavour'd at in vain. I remember I acted as you &s;eem to hint; I found a Moral fir&s;t and &s;tudied for a Fable, but could do nothing that plea&s;ed me, and &s;o left off that &s;cheme for ever. I remember one, which was to repre&s;ent what &s;coundrels ri&s;e in Armies by a long War, wherein I &s;uppos'd the Lion was engaged, and having lo&s;t all his animals of worth, at la&s;t Serjeant Hog came to be Briga|deer, and Corporal A&s;s a Colonel, &amp;c. I agree with you likewi&s;e about getting &s;omething by the &s;tage, which, when it &s;ucceeds, is the be&s;t crop for poetry in England: But, pray, take &s;ome new &s;cheme, quite different from any thing you have already touched. The pre&s;ent humour of the players, who hardly (as I was
<PB N="207" REF="225">
told in London) regard any new play, and your pre&s;ent &s;ituation at the Court, are the difficul|ties to be overcome; but tho&s;e circum&s;tances may have altered (at lea&s;t the former) &s;ince I left you. My &s;cheme was to pa&s;s a month at Aim&s;bury, and then go to Twickenham, and live a winter between that and Dawley, and &s;ometimes at Ri&s;kins, without going to Lon|don, where I now can have no occa&s;ional lodg|ings: But I am not yet in any condition for &s;uch removals. I would fain have you get enough again&s;t you grow old, to have two or three &s;ervants about you and a convenient hou&s;e. It is hard to want tho&s;e <HI>&s;ub&s;idia &s;enec|tuti,</HI> when a man grows hard to plea&s;e, and few people care whether he be plea&s;ed or no. I have a large hou&s;e, yet I &s;hould hardly pre|vail to find one vi&s;iter, if I were not able to hire him with a bottle of wine: &s;o that, when I am not abroad on hor&s;eback, I generally dine alone, and am thankful, if a friend will pa&s;s the evening with me. I am now with the re|mainder of my pint before me, and &s;o here's your health&mdash;and the &s;econd and chief is to my Tunbridge acquaintance, my Lady Du|che&s;s&mdash;and I tell you that I fear my Lord Bolingbroke and Mr. Pope (a couple of Philo|&s;ophers) would &s;tarve me, for even of port wine I &s;hould require half a pint a day, and as
<PB N="208" REF="226">
much at night: and you were growing as bad, unle&s;s your Duke and Duche&s;s have mended you. Your colic is owing to intemperance of the philo&s;ophical kind; you eat without care, and if you drink le&s;s than I, you drink too little. But your Inattention I cannot pardon, becau&s;e I imagined the cau&s;e was removed, for I thought it lay in your forty millions of &s;chemes by Court-hopes and Court-fears. Yet Mr. Pope has the &s;ame defect, and it is of all others the mo&s;t mortal to conver&s;ation; neither is my Lord Bolingbroke untinged with it: all for want of my rule, <HI>Vive la bagatelle!</HI> but the Doctor is the King of Inattention. What a vexatious life &s;hould I lead among you? If the Duche&s;s be a <HI>reveu&s;e,</HI> I will never come to Aim&s;bury; or, if I do, I will run away from you both, to one of her women, and the &s;teward and chaplain.</P>

<P>I mentioned &s;omething to Mr. Gay of a Tunbridge-acquaintance, whom we forget of cour&s;e when we return to town, and yet I am a&s;&s;ured that if they meet again next &s;ummer, they have a better title to re&s;ume their com|merce. Thus I look on my right of corre|&s;ponding with your Grace to be better e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd upon your return to Aim&s;bury; and I
<PB N="209" REF="227">
&s;hall at this time de&s;cend to forget, or at lea&s;t &s;u&s;pend my re&s;entments of your neglect all the time you were in London. I &s;till keep in my heart, that Mr. Gay had no &s;ooner turned his back, than you left the place in his letter void which he had commanded you to fill: though your guilt confounded you &s;o far, that you wanted pre&s;ence of mind to blot out the la&s;t line, where that command &s;tared you in the face. But it is my misfortune to quarrel with all my acquaintance, and always come by the wor&s;t; and fortune is ever again&s;t me, but ne|ver &s;o much as by pur&s;uing me out of mere partiality to your Grace, for which you are to an&s;wer. By your connivance, &s;he hath plea&s;|ed, by one &s;tumble on the &s;tairs, to give me a lamene&s;s that &s;ix months have not been able perfectly to cure: and thus I am prevented from revenging my&s;elf by continuing a month at Aim&s;bury, and breeding confu&s;ion in your Grace's family. No di&s;appointment through my whole life hath been &s;o vexatious by many degrees; and God knows whether I &s;hall ever live to &s;ee the invi&s;ible Lady to whom I was obliged for &s;o many favours, and whom I ne|ver beheld &s;ince &s;he was a bratt in hanging|&s;leeves.

But I will &s;end for the money when you put me into the way, for I &s;hall want it here, my affairs being in a bad condi|tion by the mi&s;eries of the kingdom, and my own private fortune being wholly embroiled, and wor&s;e than ever; &s;o that I &s;hall &s;oon peti|tion the Duche&s;s, as an object of charity, to lend me three or four thou&s;and pounds to keep up my dignity. My one hundred pound will buy me &s;ix hog&s;heads of wine, which will &s;up|port me a year; <HI>pr$vi&s;ae frugis in annum Copia.</HI> Horace de&s;ired no more; for I will con&s;true <HI>frugis</HI> to be wine.

I want to be Mini&s;ter of Aim&s;bury, Dawley, Twickenham, Ri&s;kins, and Prebendary of We&s;tmin&s;ter, el&s;e I will not &s;tir a &s;tep, but content my&s;elf with making the Duche&s;s mi&s;erable three months next &s;um|mer. But I keep ill company: I mean the Duche&s;s and you, who are both out of favour; and &s;o I find am I, by a few ver&s;es wherein Pope and you have your parts.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I was the mo&s;t unwary creature in the world, when, again&s;t my old maxims, I writ fir&s;t to you upon your return to Tunbridge. I beg that this conde&s;cen&s;ion of mine may go no farther, and that you will not pretend to make a prece|dent of it. I never knew any man cured of any Inattention, although the pretended cau&s;es were removed. When I was with Mr. Gay la&s;t in London, talking with him on &s;ome poetical &s;ubjects, he would an&s;wer; <Q>&startq;Well, I am de|termined not to accept the employment of Gentleman-u&s;her:&endq;</Q> and of the &s;ame di&s;po|&s;ition were all my poetical friends, and if you cannot cure him, I utterly de&s;pair.&mdash;As to your&s;elf, I will &s;ay to you (though compari&s;ons be odious) what I &s;aid to the&mdash;, that your qua|lity &s;hould be never any motive of e&s;teem to me: My compliment was then lo&s;t, but it will not be &s;o to you. For I know you more by any one of your letters than I could by &s;ix months conver&s;ing. Your pen is always more natural and &s;incere and unaffected than your tongue; in writing you are too lazy to give your&s;elf the trouble of acting a part, and have indeed acted &s;o indi&s;creetly that I have you at mercy; and although you &s;hould arrive to &s;uch
<PB N="213" REF="231">
a height of immorality as to deny your hand, yet, whenever I produce it, the world will unite in &s;wearing this mu&s;t come from you only.</P>
<P>I will an&s;wer your que&s;tion. Mr. Gay is not di&s;creet enough to live alone, but he is too di&s;creet to live alone; and yet (unle&s;s you mend him) he will live alone even in your Grace's company. Your quarrelling with each other upon the &s;ubject of bread and butter, is the mo&s;t u&s;ual thing in the world; Parliaments, Courts, Cities, and Kingdoms quarrel for no other cau&s;e; from hence, and from hence only ari&s;e all the quarrels between Whig and To|ry; between tho&s;e who are in the Mini&s;try, and tho&s;e who are out; between all pretenders to employment in the Church, the Law, and the Army: even the common proverb teaches you this, when we &s;ay, It is none of my bread and butter, meaning it is no bu&s;ine&s;s of mine. Therefore I de&s;pair of any reconcilement be|tween you till the affair of bread and butter be adju&s;ted, wherein I would gladly be a media|tor. If Mahomet &s;hould come to the moun|tain, how happy would an excellent lady be, who lives a few miles from this town? As I was telling of Mr. Gay's way of living at Aim&s;bury, &s;he offer'd fifty guineas to have you both at her hou&s;e for one hour over a bottle of Burgundy, which we were then drinking. To
<PB N="214" REF="232">

I never will believe one word you &s;ay of my Lord Duke, unle&s;s I &s;ee three or four lines in his own hand at the bottom of yours. I have a concern in the whole family, and Mr. Gay mu&s;t give me a particular ac|count of every branch, for I am not a&s;hamed of you tho' you be Duke and Duche&s;s, tho' I have been of others who are, &amp;c. and I do not doubt but even your own &s;ervants love you, even down to your po&s;tilions; and when I come to Aim&s;bury, before I &s;ee your Grace I will have an hour's conver&s;ation with the Vicar, who will tell me how familiarly you talk to Goody Dob&s;on and all the neighbours, as if you were their equal, and that you were god|mother to her &s;on Jacky.</P>

<P>I U&s;ually write to friends after a pau&s;e of a few weeks, that I may not interrupt them in better company, better thoughts, and better diver&s;ions. I believe, I have told you of a great Man, who &s;aid to me, that he never once in his life receiv'd a good letter from Ireland: for which there are rea&s;ons enough without affront|ing our under&s;tandings. For there is not one per&s;on out of this country, who regards any events that pa&s;s here, unle&s;s he hath an e&s;tate or employment.&mdash;I cannot tell that you or I ever gave the lea&s;t provocation to the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try, and much le&s;s to the Court; and yet I am ten times more out of favour than you. For my own part, I do not &s;ee the politic of opening common letters, directed to per&s;ons generally known: for a man's under&s;tanding would be very weak to convey &s;ecrets by the po&s;t, if he knew any, which, I declare, I do not: and be&s;ides I think the world is already &s;o well informed by plain events, that I que&s;tion whether the Mini&s;ters have any &s;ecrets at all. Neither would I be under any apprehen&s;ion if a letter &s;hould be &s;ent me full of trea&s;on; be|cau&s;e I cannot hinder people from writing what
<PB N="216" REF="234">
they plea&s;e, nor &s;ending it to me; and although it &s;hould be di&s;cover'd to have been open'd be|fore it came to my hand, I would only burn it and think no further. I approve of the &s;cheme you have to grow &s;omewhat richer, though, I agree, you will meet with di&s;couragements; and it is rea&s;onable you &s;hould, con&s;idering what kind of pens are at this time only em|ployed and encouraged. For you mu&s;t allow that the bad painter was in the right, who, hav|ing painted a cock, drove away all the cocks and hens and even the chickens, for fear tho&s;e who pa&s;&s;ed by his &s;hop might make a compa|ri&s;on with his work. And I will &s;ay one thing in &s;pite of the Po&s;t-officers, that &s;ince Wit and Learning began to be made u&s;e of in our king|doms, they were never profe&s;&s;edly thrown a&s;ide, contemned, and puni&s;hed, till within your own memory; nor Dulne&s;s and Igno|rance ever &s;o openly encouraged and promoted. In an&s;wer to what you &s;ay of my living among you, if I could do it to my ea&s;e; perhaps you have heard of a &s;cheme for an exchange in Berk&s;hire propo&s;ed by two of our friends; but, be&s;ides the difficulty of adju&s;ting certain cir|cum&s;tances, it would not an&s;wer. I am at a time of life that &s;eeks ea&s;e and independence; you'll hear my rea&s;ons when you &s;ee tho&s;e friends, and I concluded them with &s;aying;
<PB N="217" REF="235">
That I would rather be a freeman among &s;laves, than a &s;lave among freemen. The dig|nity of my pre&s;ent &s;tation damps the pertne&s;s of inferior puppies and &s;quires, which, without plenty and ea&s;e on your &s;ide the channel, would break my heart in a month.</P>

<P>See what it is to live where I do. I am ut|terly ignorant of that &s;ame Strado del Poe; and yet, if that Author be again&s;t lending or giving money, I cannot but think him a good Courtier; which, I am &s;ure, your Grace is not, no not &s;o much as to be a Maid of honour. For I am certainly informed, that you are neither a free|thinker, nor can &s;ell bargains; that you can neither &s;pell, nor talk, nor write, nor think like a Courtier; than you pretend to be re&s;pect|ed for qualities which have been out of fa&s;hion ever &s;ince you were almo&s;t in your cradle; that your contempt for a fine petticoat is an infallible mark of di&s;affection; which is further confirm|ed by your ill ta&s;te for Wit, in preferring two old-fa&s;hion'd poets before Duck or Cibber. Be&s;ides, you &s;pell in &s;uch a manner as no court|lady can read, and write in &s;uch an old-fa&s;hion|ed &s;tyle, as none of them can under&s;tand.&mdash;You need not be in pain about Mr. Gay's &s;tock of health. I promi&s;e you he will &s;pend it all
<PB N="218" REF="236">
upon lazine&s;s, and run deep in debt by a win|ter's repo&s;e in town; therefore I entreat your Grace will order him to move his chops le&s;s and his legs more for the &s;ix cold months, el&s;e he will &s;pend all his money in phy&s;ic and coach|hire. I am in much perplexity about your Grace's declaration, of the manner in which you di&s;po&s;e what you call your love and re&s;pect, which, you &s;ay, are not paid to Merit but to your own Humour. Now, Madam, my m$&s;|fortune is, that I have nothing to plead but abundance of Merit, and there goes an ugly ob&s;ervation, that the Humour of ladies is apt to change. Now, Madam, if I &s;hould go to Aim&s;bury with a great load of merit, and your Grace happen to be out of humour, and will not purcha&s;e my merchandize at the price of your re&s;pect, the goods may be damaged, and no body el&s;e will take them off my hands. Be|&s;ides, you have declared Mr. Gay to hold the fir&s;t part, and I but the &s;econd; which is hard treatment, &s;ince I &s;hall be the newe&s;t acquaint|ance by &s;ome years; and I will appeal to all the re&s;t of your &s;ex, whether &s;uch an innovation ought to be allowed? I &s;hould be ready to &s;ay in the common forms, that I was much obliged to the Lady who wi&s;h'd &s;he could give the be&s;t living, &amp;c. if I did not vehemently &s;u&s;pect it was the very &s;ame Lady who &s;poke many

things to me in the &s;ame &s;tyle, and al&s;o with regard to the gentleman at your elbow when you writ, who&s;e Dupe he was, as well as of her Waiting-woman; but they were both ar|rant knaves, as I told him and a third friend, though they will not believe it to this day. I de&s;ire to pre&s;ent my mo&s;t humble re&s;pects to my Lord Duke, and with my heartie&s;t prayer for the pro&s;perity of the whole family, remain your Grace's, &amp;c.</P>

<P>I Doubt, habit hath little power to reconcile us with &s;ickne&s;s attended by pain. With me, the lowne&s;s of &s;pirits hath a mo&s;t unhappy effect; I am grown le&s;s patient with &s;olitude, and harder to be pleas'd with company; which I could formerly better dige&s;t, when I could be ea&s;ier without it than at pre&s;ent. As to &s;end|ing you any thing that I have written &s;ince I left you (either ver&s;e or pro&s;e) I can only &s;ay, that I have order'd by my Will, that all my Papers of any kind &s;hall be deliver'd you to di&s;|po&s;e of as you plea&s;e. I have &s;everal things
<PB N="220" REF="238">
that I have had &s;chemes to fini&s;h, or to attempt, but I very fooli&s;hly put off the trouble, as &s;in|ners do their repentance: for I grow every day more aver&s;e from writing, which is very na|tural, and, when I take a pen, &s;ay to my&s;elf a thou&s;and times, <HI>non e&s;t tanti.</HI> As to tho&s;e pa|pers of four or five years pa&s;t, that you are pleas'd to require &s;oon; they con&s;i&s;t of little accidental things writ in the country; family amu&s;ements, never intended further than to divert our&s;elves and &s;ome neighbours: or &s;ome effects of anger on Public Grievances here, which would be in&s;ignificant out of this king|dom. Two or three of us had a fancy, three years ago, to write a Weekly paper, and call it an Intelligencer. But it continued not long; for the whole Volume (it was re-printed in Lon|don, and, I find, you have &s;een it) was the work only of two, my&s;elf and Dr. Sheridan. If we could have got &s;ome ingenious young man to have been the manager, who &s;hould have pub|li&s;hed all that might be &s;ent to him, it might have continued longer, for there were hints enough. But the Printer here could not afford &s;uch a young man one farthing for his trouble, the &s;ale being &s;o &s;mall, and the price one half|penny; and &s;o it dropt. In the Volume you &s;aw (to an&s;wer your que&s;tions) the 1, 3, 5, 7, were mine. Of the 8th I writ only the Ver&s;es,
<PB N="221" REF="239">
(very uncorrect, but again&s;t a fellow we all hated) the 9th mine, the 10th only the Ver&s;es, and of tho&s;e not the four la&s;t &s;lovenly lines; the 15th is a Pamphlet of mine printed before with Dr. Sh&mdash;'s Preface, merely for lazine&s;s not to di&s;appoint the town; and &s;o was the 19th, which contains only a parcel of facts re|lating purely to the mi&s;eries of Ireland, and wholly u&s;ele&s;s and unentertaining. As to other things of mine &s;ince I left you; there are in pro&s;e a View of the State of Ireland; a Project for eating Children; and a Defence of Lord Carteret; in ver&s;e a Libel on Dr. D&mdash;and Lord Carteret; a Letter to Dr. D&mdash;on the Libels writ again&s;t him; the Barrack (a &s;tolen Copy) the Lady's Journal; the Lady's Dre&s;s|ing-room (a &s;tolen Copy) the Plea of the Damn'd (a &s;tolen Copy;) all the&s;e have been printed in London. (I forgot to tell you that the Tale of Sir Ralph was &s;ent from England.) Be|&s;ides the&s;e there are five or &s;ix (perhaps more) Papers of Ver&s;es writ in the North, but per|fect Family-things, two or three of which may be tolerable; the re&s;t but indifferent, and the humour only local, and &s;ome that would give offence to the times. Such as they are, I will bring them, tolerable or bad, if I recover this lamene&s;s, and live long enough to &s;ee you ei|ther here or there. I forget again to tell you,
<PB N="222" REF="240">
that the Scheme of paying Debts by a Tax on Vices, is not one &s;yllable mine, but of a young Clergy-man whom I countenance; he told me it was built upon a pa&s;&s;age in Gulliver, where a Projector hath &s;omething upon the &s;ame Thought. This young Man is the mo&s;t hope|ful we have: a book of his Poems was printed in London; Dr. D&mdash;is one of his Patrons: he is marry'd and has children, and makes up about 100 <HI>l.</HI> a year, on which he lives decent|ly. The utmo&s;t &s;tretch of his ambition is, to gather up as much &s;uperfluous money as will give him a &s;ight of you, and half an hour of your pre&s;ence; after which he will return home in full &s;atisfaction, and in proper time die in peace.</P>
<P>My poetical fountain is drain'd, and I pro|fe&s;s, I grow gradually &s;o dry, that a Rhime with me is almo&s;t as hard to find as a Guinea; and even Pro&s;e &s;peculations tire me almo&s;t as much. Yet I have a thing in pro&s;e, begun above twen|ty-eight years ago, and almo&s;t fini&s;h'd. It will make a four-&s;hilling Volume, and is &s;uch a perfection of folly, that you &s;hall never hear of it till it is printed, and then you &s;hall be left to gue&s;s <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Polite Conver&s;ation.</NOTE>. Nay I have another of the &s;ame age, which will require a long time to perfect, and is wor&s;e than the former, in which I will &s;erve

you the &s;ame way. I heard lately from Mr.&mdash;, who promi&s;es to be le&s;s lazy in order to mend his fortune. But women who live by their beauty, and men by their wit, are &s;eldom pro|vident enough to con&s;ider that both Wit and Beauty will go off with years, and there is no living upon the credit of what is pa&s;t.</P>
<P>I am in great concern to hear of my Lady Bolingbroke's ill health returned upon her, and, I doubt, my Lord will find Dawley too &s;olitary without her. In that, neither he nor you are companions young enough for me, and, I be|lieve, the be&s;t part of the rea&s;on why men are &s;aid to grow children when they are old, is becau&s;e they cannot entertain them&s;elves with thinking; which is the very ca&s;e of little boys and girls, who love to be noi&s;y among their play-fellows. I am told Mrs. Pope is without pain, and I have not heard of a more gentle decay, without unea&s;ine&s;s to her&s;elf or friends; yet I cannot but pity you, who are ten times the greater &s;ufferer, by having the per&s;on you mo&s;t love, &s;o long before you, and dying daily; and I pray God it may not affect your mind or your health.</P>

An in|flammatory fever hurried him out of this life in three days. He died la&s;t night at nine o'clock, not deprived of his &s;en&s;es entirely at la&s;t, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them perfectly till within five hours. He a&s;ked of you a few hours before, when in acute torment by the inflammation in his bowels and brea&s;t. His effects are in the Duke of Queen&s;bury's cu&s;tody.

<P>I Received yours with a few lines from the Doctor, and the account of our lo&s;ing Mr. Gay, upon which event I &s;hall &s;ay nothing. I am only concern'd that long living hath not hardened me: for even in this kingdom, and in a few days pa&s;t, two per&s;ons of great merit, whom I loved very well, have died in the prime of their years, but a little above thirty. I would endeavour to comfort my&s;elf upon the lo&s;s of friends, as I do upon the lo&s;s of money; by turning to my account-book, and &s;eeing whether I have enough left for my &s;upport; but in the former ca&s;e I find I have not, any
<PB N="227" REF="245" MS="Y">
more than in the other; and I know not any man who is in a greater likelyhood than my|&s;elf to die poor and friendle&s;s. You are a much greater lo&s;er than me by his death, as being a more intimate friend, and often his compa|nion; which latter I could never hope to be, except perhaps once more in my life for a piece of a &s;ummer. I hope he hath left you the care of any writings he may have left, and I wi&s;h, that, with tho&s;e already extant, they could be all publi&s;hed in a fair edition under your in|&s;pection. Your Poem on the U&s;e of Riches hath been ju&s;t printed here, and we have no objection but the ob&s;curity of &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages by our ignorance in facts and per&s;ons, which makes us lo&s;e abundance of the Satire. Had the printer given me notice, I would have ho|ne&s;tly printed the names at length, where I happened to know them; and writ explanatory notes, which however would have been but few, for my long ab&s;ence hath made me igno|rant of what pa&s;&s;es out of the &s;cene where I am. I never had the lea&s;t hint from you about this work, any more than of your former, upon Ta&s;te. We are told here, that you are pre|paring other pieces of the &s;ame bulk to be in|&s;cribed to other friends, one (for in&s;tance) to my Lord Bolingbroke, another to Lord Ox|ford, and &s;o on.&mdash;Doctor Delany pre&s;ents you
<PB N="228" REF="246">
his mo&s;t humble &s;ervice: he behaves him&s;elf very commendably, conver&s;es only with his former friends, makes no parade, but enter|tains them con&s;tantly at an elegant plentiful ta|ble, walks the &s;treets as u&s;ual, by day-light, does many acts of charity and genero&s;ity, culti|vates a country-hou&s;e two miles di&s;tant, and is one of tho&s;e very few within my knowledge, on whom a great acce&s;s of fortune hath made no manner of change. And particularly he is often without money, as he was before. We have got my Lord Orrery among us, being forced to continue here on the ill condition of his e&s;tate by the knavery of an Agent; he is a mo&s;t worthy Gentleman, whom, I hope, you will be acquainted with. I am very much obliged by your favour to Mr. P&mdash;, which, I de&s;ire, may continue no longer than he &s;hall de|&s;erve by his Mode&s;ty, a virtue I never knew him to want, but is hard for young men to keep, without abundance of balla&s;t. If you are acquainted with the Duche&s;s of Queen&s;|bury, I de&s;ire you will pre&s;ent her my mo&s;t humble &s;ervice: I think &s;he is a greater lo&s;er by the death of a friend than either of us. She &s;eems a Lady of excellent &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit. I had often Po&s;t&s;cripts from her in our friend's letters to me, and her part was &s;ometimes longer than his, and they made up a great part of the
<PB N="229" REF="247">
little happine&s;s I could have here. This was the more generous, becau&s;e I never &s;aw her &s;ince &s;he was a girl of five years old, nor did I envy poor Mr. Gay for any thing &s;o much as being a dome&s;tic friend to &s;uch a Lady. I de|&s;ire you will never fail to &s;end me a particular account of your health. I dare hardly enquire about Mrs. Pope, who, I am told, is but ju&s;t among the living, and con&s;equently a continual grief to you: &s;he is &s;en&s;ible of your tenderne&s;s, which robs her of the only happine&s;s &s;he is capable of enjoying. And yet I pity you more than her; you cannot lengthen her days, and I beg &s;he may not &s;horten yours.</P>

<P>IT is indeed impo&s;&s;ible to &s;peak on &s;uch a a &s;ubject as the lo&s;s of Mr. Gay, to me an irreparable one. But I &s;end you what I intend for the in&s;cription on his tomb, which the Duke of Queen&s;bury will &s;et up at We&s;tmin|&s;ter. As to his writings, he left no Will, nor &s;poke a word of them, or any thing el&s;e, dur|ing his &s;hort and precipitate illne&s;s, in which I attended him to his la&s;t breath. The Duke
<PB N="230" REF="248">
has acted more than the part of a brother to him, and it will be &s;trange if the &s;i&s;ters do not leave his papers totally to his di&s;po&s;al, who will do the &s;ame that I would with them. He has managed the Comedy (which our poor friend gave to the playhou&s;e the week before his death) to the utmo&s;t advantage for his rela|tions; and propo&s;es to do the &s;ame with &s;ome Fables he left fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>There is nothing of late which I think of more than Mortality, and what you mention, of collecting the be&s;t monuments we can of our friends, their own images in their writings: (for tho&s;e are the be&s;t, when their minds are &s;uch as Mr. Gay's was, and as yours is.) I am preparing al&s;o for my own, and have nothing &s;o much at heart, as to &s;hew the &s;illy world that men of Wit, or even Poets, may be the mo&s;t moral of mankind. A few loo&s;e things &s;ometimes fall from them, by which cen&s;orious fools judge as ill of them as po&s;&s;ibly they can, for their own comfort: and indeed, when &s;uch unguarded and trifling <HI>Jeux d' E|&s;pirit</HI> have once got abroad, all that prudence or repentance can do, &s;ince they cannot be de|ny'd, is to put 'em fairly upon that foot; and teach the public (as we have done in the pre|face to the four volumes of Mi&s;cellanies) to di|&s;tingui&s;h betwixt our &s;tudies and our idlene&s;&s;es,
<PB REF="249" MS="Y">
<PB N="231" REF="250" MS="Y">
our works and our weakne&s;&s;es. That was the whole end of the la&s;t Vol. of Mi&s;cellanies, with|out which our former declaration in that pre|face, "That the&s;e volumes contained all that "we have ever offended in that way," would have been di&s;credited. It went indeed to my heart, to omit what you called the Libel on Dr. D&mdash;, and the be&s;t Panegyric on my&s;elf, that either my own times or any other could have afforded, or will ever afford to me. The book as you ob&s;erve, was printed in great ha&s;te; the cau&s;e whereof was, that the book&s;ellers here were doing the &s;ame, in collecting your pieces, the corn with the chaff; I don't mean that any thing of yours is chaff, but with other wit of Ireland which was &s;o, and the whole in your name. I meant principally to oblige them to &s;eparate what you writ &s;eriou&s;ly from what you writ carele&s;sly; and thought my own weeds might pa&s;s for a &s;ort of wild flowers, when bun|dled up with them.</P>

My Mother lives (which is an an&s;wer to that point) and, I thank God, tho' her memory be in a manner gone, is yet awake and &s;en&s;ible to me, tho' &s;carce to any thing el&s;e; which doubles the rea&s;on of my attend|ance, and at the &s;ame time &s;weetens it.

Lord Peterborow has narrowly e&s;|caped death, and yet keeps his chamber: he is perpetually &s;peaking in the mo&s;t affectionate manner of you: he has written you two letters, which you never received, and by that has been di&s;couraged from writing more. I can well believe the po&s;t-office may do this, when &s;ome letters of his to me have met the &s;ame fate, and two of mine to him.

<P>YOU &s;ay truly, that death is only terrible to us as it &s;eparates us from tho&s;e we love, but I really think tho&s;e have the wor&s;t of it who are left by us, if we are true friends. I have felt more (I fancy) in the lo&s;s of Mr. Gay, than I &s;hall &s;uffer in the thought of going away my&s;elf into a &s;tate that can feel none of this &s;ort of lo&s;&s;es. I wi&s;h'd vehemently to have &s;een him in a condition of living independent, and to have lived in perfect indolence the re&s;t of our days together, the two mo&s;t idle, mo&s;t in|nocent, unde&s;igning Poets of our age. I now as vehemently wi&s;h you and I might walk into the grave together, by as &s;low &s;teps as you plea&s;e, but contentedly and chearfully: Whe|ther that ever can be, or in what country, I know no more, than into what country we &s;hall walk out of the grave. But it &s;uffices me to know it will be exactly what region or &s;tate our Maker appoints, and that whatever <HI>Is,</HI> is <HI>Right.</HI> Our poor friend's papers are partly in my hands, and for as much as is &s;o, I will take care to &s;uppre&s;s things unworthy of him. As to the Epitaph, I'm &s;orry you gave a copy, for
<PB N="236" REF="255">
it will certainly by that means come into print, and I would correct it more, unle&s;s you will do it for me (and that I &s;hall like as well:) Upon the whole, I earne&s;tly wi&s;h your coming over hither, for this rea&s;on among many others, that your influence may be join'd with mine to &s;uppre&s;s whatever we may judge proper of his papers. To be plunged in my Neighbour's and my papers, will be your inevitable fate as &s;oon as you come. That I am an author who&s;e characters are thought of &s;ome weight, ap|pears from the great noi&s;e and bu&s;tle that the Court and Town make about any I give: and I will not render them le&s;s important, or le&s;s intere&s;ting, by &s;paring Vice and Folly, or by betraying the cau&s;e of Truth and Virtue. I will take care they &s;hall be &s;uch, as no man can be angry at but the per&s;ons I would have angry. You are &s;en&s;ible with what decency and ju&s;tice I paid homage to the Royal Fami|ly, at the &s;ame time that I &s;atirized fal&s;e Cour|tiers, and Spies, &amp;c. about 'em. I have not the courage however to be &s;uch a Satiri&s;t as you, but I would be as much, or more, a Phi|lo&s;opher. You call your &s;atires, Libels; I would rather call my &s;atires, Epi&s;tles: They will con&s;i&s;t more of Morality than of Wit, and grow graver, which you will call duller. I &s;hall leave it to my Antagoni&s;ts to be witty (if they
<PB N="237" REF="256">
can) and content my&s;elf to be u&s;eful, and in the right. Tell me your opinion as to Lady&mdash;'s or Lord *'s performance? they are certainly the Top-wits of the Court, and you may judge by that &s;ingle piece what can be done again&s;t me; for it was labour'd, corrected, prae-com|mended and po&s;t-di&s;approv'd, &s;o far as to be di&s;-own'd by them&s;elves, after each had highly cry'd it up for the others <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See the Epi&s;tle written on this occa&s;ion at the end of the &s;econd Vol. of Letters.</NOTE>.

When does your collection come out, and what will it con&s;i&s;t of?

<HEAD>LETTER LXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To Mr. POPE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Dublin, May 1, 1733.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I An&s;wer your Letter the &s;ooner becau&s;e I have a particular rea&s;on for doing &s;o. Some weeks ago came over a Poem call'd, <HI>The Life and Character of Dr.</HI> S. <HI>written by him&s;elf.</HI> It was reprinted here, and is dedicated to you. It is grounded upon a Maxim in Rochefoucault, and the dedication, after a formal &s;tory, &s;ays, that my manner of writing is to be found in every line. I believe I have told you, that I writ a year or two ago near five hundred lines upon the &s;ame Maxim in Rochefoucault, and was a long time about it, as that Impo&s;tor &s;ays in his Dedication, with many circum&s;tances, all pure invention. I de&s;ire you to believe, and to tell my friends, that in this &s;purious piece there is not a &s;ingle line, or bit of a line, or thought, any way re&s;embling the genuine Copy, any more than it does Virgil's Aeneis; for I never gave a Copy of mine, nor lent it out of my &s;ight. And although I &s;hew'd it to all common ac|quaintance indifferently, and &s;ome of them (e&s;pecially one or two females) had got many lines by heart, here and there, and repeated
<PB N="240" REF="259">
them often; yet it happens that not one &s;ingle line, or thought is contained in this Impo&s;ture, although it appears that they who counter&s;eited me, had heard of the true one. But even this trick &s;hall not provoke me to print the true one, which indeed is not proper to be &s;een, till I can be &s;een no more: I therefore de&s;ire you will un|deceive my friends, and I will order an Adver|ti&s;ement to be printed here, and tran&s;mit it to England, that every body may know the delu|&s;ion, and acquit me, as, I am &s;ure, you mu&s;t have done your&s;elf, if you have read any part of it, which is mean, and trivial, and full of that Cant that I mo&s;t de&s;pi&s;e: I would &s;ink to be a Vicar in Norfolk rather than be charged with &s;uch a performance. Now I come to your letter.</P>
<P>When I was of your age, I thought every day of death, but now every minute; and a continual giddy di&s;order more or le&s;s is a greater addition than that of my years. I cannot af|firm that I pity our friend Gay, but I pity his friends, I pity you, and would at lea&s;t equally pity my&s;elf, if I liv'd among&s;t you; becau&s;e I &s;hould have &s;een him oftner than you did, who are a kind of Hermit, how great a noi&s;e &s;oever you make by your Ill nature in not letting the hone&s;t Villains of the times enjoy them&s;elves in this world, which is their only happine&s;s, and
<PB N="241" REF="260">
terrifying them with another. I &s;hould have added in my libel, that of all men living you are the mo&s;t happy in your Enemies and your Friends: and I will &s;wear you have fifty times more Charity for manking than I could ever pretend to. Whether the production you men|tion came from the Lady or the Lord, I did not imagine that they were at lea&s;t &s;o bad ver&s;ifyers. Therefore, <HI>facit indignatio ver&s;us,</HI> is only to be apply'd when the indignation is again&s;t general Villainy, and never operates when &s;ome &s;ort of people write to defend them&s;elves. I love to hear them reproach you for dulne&s;s; only I would be &s;atisfy'd, &s;ince you are &s;o dull, why are they &s;o angry? Give me a &s;hilling, and I will en&s;ure you, that po&s;terity &s;hall never know you had one &s;ingle enemy, excepting tho&s;e who&s;e memory you have pre&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry for the &s;ituation of Mr. Gay's pa|pers. You do not exert your&s;elf as much as I could wi&s;h in this affair. I had rather the two &s;i&s;ters were hang'd than &s;ee his works &s;well'd by any lo&s;s of credit to his memory. I would be glad to &s;ee the mo&s;t valuable printed by them&s;elves, tho&s;e which ought not to be &s;een burn'd immediately, and the others that have gone abroad, printed &s;eparately like opu&s;cula, or rather be &s;tifled and forgotten. I thought your Epitaph was immediately to be ingrav'd,
<PB N="242" REF="261" MS="Y">
and therefore I made le&s;s &s;cruple to give a Copy to Lord Orrery, who earne&s;tly de&s;ir'd it, but to no body el&s;e; and, he tells me, he gave only two, which he will recall. I have a &s;hort Epi|gram of his upon it, wherein I would correct a line, or two at mo&s;t, and then I will &s;end it you (with his permi&s;&s;ion.) I have nothing again&s;t yours, but the la&s;t line, <HI>Striking their aching;</HI> the two participles, as they are &s;o near, &s;eem to &s;ound too like. I &s;hall write to the Duche&s;s, who hath lately honoured me with a very friendly letter, and I will tell her my opinion freely about our friend's papers. I want health, and my affairs are enlarged: but I will break through the latter, if the other mends. I can u&s;e a cour&s;e of medicines, lame and giddy. My chief de&s;ign, next to &s;eeing you, is to be a &s;e|vere Critic on you and your neighbour; but fir&s;t kill his father, that he may be able to maintain me in my own way of living, and particularly my hor&s;es. It co&s;t me near 600<HI>l.</HI> for a wall to keep mine, and I never ride without two &s;er|vants for fear of accidents; <HI>hic vivimus ambi|tio&s;a paupertate.</HI> You are both too poor for my acquaintance, but he much the poorer. With you I will find gra&s;s, and wine, and &s;ervants, but with him not.&mdash;The Collection you &s;peak of is this. A Printer came to me to de&s;ire he might print my works (as he call'd them) in
<PB N="243" REF="262">
four volumes, by &s;ub&s;cription. I &s;aid I would give no leave, and &s;hould be &s;orry to &s;ee them printed here. He &s;aid they could not be printed in London. I an&s;wer'd, they could, if the Part|ners agreed. He &s;aid he <Q>&startq;would be glad of my permi&s;&s;ion, but as he could print them without it, and was advis'd that it could do me no harm, and having been a&s;&s;ur'd of nu|merous &s;ub&s;criptions, he hoped I would not be angry at his pur&s;uing his own intere&s;t, &amp;c.&endq;</Q> Much of this di&s;cour&s;e pa&s;t, and he goes on with the matter, wherein I determine not to intermeddle, though it be much to my di&s;content; and I wi&s;h it could be done in Eng|land, rather than here, although I am grown pretty indifferent in every thing of that kind. This is the truth of the &s;tory.</P>
<P>My Vanity turns at pre&s;ent on being per&s;on|ated in your <HI>Quae Virtus,</HI> &amp;c. You will ob|&s;erve in this letter many marks of an ill head and a low &s;pirit; but a Heart wholly turned to love you with the greate&s;t Earne&s;tne&s;s and Truth.</P>

<PB N="244" REF="263">
I mu&s;t fir&s;t acknowledge the honour done me by Lord Orrery, who&s;e prai&s;es are that precious ointment Solomon &s;peaks of, which can be given only by men of Virtue: all other prai&s;e, whether from Poets or Peers, is contemptible alike: and I am old enough and experienced enough to know, that the only prai&s;es worth having, are tho&s;e be&s;towed <HI>by</HI> Virtue <HI>for</HI> Vir|tue. My Poetry I abandon to the critics, my Morals I commit to the te&s;timony of tho&s;e who know me; and therefore I was more pleas'd with your Libel, than with any Ver&s;es I ever receiv'd. I wi&s;h &s;uch a collection of your writings could be printed here, as you mention going on in Ireland. I was &s;urpriz'd to receive from the Printer that &s;purious piece, call'd The Life and Character of Dr. Swift, with a letter telling me the per&s;on, <Q>&startq;who publi&s;h'd it, had a&s;&s;ur'd him the Dedication to me was what I would not take ill, or el&s;e he would not have printed it.&endq;</Q> I can't tell who the man is, who took &s;o far upon him as to an&s;wer for my way of thinking; tho', had the thing been genuine, I &s;hould have been greatly di&s;pleas'd at the publi&s;her's part, in doing it without your knowledge.</P>
<P>I am as earne&s;t as you can be, in doing my be&s;t to prevent the publi&s;hing of any thing un|worthy of Mr. Gay; but I fear his friends par|tiality.
<PB N="245" REF="264">
I wi&s;h you would come over. All the my&s;teries of my philo&s;ophical work &s;hall then be clear'd to you, and you will not think that I am not merry enough, nor angry enough: It will not want for Satire, but as for Anger I know it not; or at lea&s;t only that &s;ort of which the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks, <Q>&startq;Be ye angry and &s;in not.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>My Neighbour's writings have been meta|phy&s;ical, and will next be hi&s;torical. It is cer|tainly from him only that a valuable Hi&s;tory of Europe in the&s;e latter times can be expected. Come, and quicken him; for age, indolence, and contempt of the world, grow upon men apace, and may often make the wi&s;e&s;t indiffer|ent whether po&s;terity be any wi&s;er than we. To a man in years, Health and Quiet become &s;uch rarities, and con&s;equently &s;o valuable, that he is apt to think of nothing more than of en|joying them whenever he can, for the remainder of life; and this, I doubt not, has caus'd &s;o many great men to die without leaving a &s;crap to po&s;terity.</P>
<P>I am &s;incerely troubled for the bad account you give of your own health. I wi&s;h every day to hear a better, as much as I do to enjoy my own, I faithfully a&s;&s;ure you.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Dublin, July 8, 1733.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Mu&s;t condole with you for the lo&s;s of Mrs. Pope, of who&s;e death the papers have been full. But I would rather rejoice with you, be|cau&s;e, if any circum&s;tances can make the death of a dear Parent and Friend a &s;ubject for joy, you have them all. She died in an extreme old age, without pain, under the care of the mo&s;t dutiful Son that I have ever known or heard of, which is a felicity not happening to one in a million. The wor&s;t effect of her death falls up|on me, and &s;o much the wor&s;e, becau&s;e I expect|ed <HI>aliquis damno u&s;us in illo,</HI> that it would be followed by making me and this kingdom hap|py with your pre&s;ence. But I am told, to my great misfortune, that a very convenient offer happening, you waved the invitation pre&s;&s;ed on you, alledging the fear you had of being killed here with eating and drinking. By which I find that you have given &s;ome credit to a no|tion, of our great plenty and ho&s;pitality. It is true, our meat and wine is cheaper here, as it is always in the poore&s;t countries, becau&s;e there is no money to pay for them: I believe there are
<PB N="247" REF="266">
not in this whole city three Gentlemen out of Employment, who are able to give Entertain|ments once a month. Tho&s;e who are in em|ployments of church or &s;tate, are three parts in four from England, and amount to little more than a dozen: Tho&s;e indeed may once or twice invite their friends, or any per&s;on of di&s;tinction that makes a voyage hither. All my acquaint|ance tell me, they know not above three fami|lies where they can occa&s;ionally dine in a whole year: Dr. Delany is the only gentleman I know, who keeps one certain day in the week to en|tertain &s;even or eight friends at dinner, and to pa&s;s the evening, where there is nothing of ex|ce&s;s, either in eating or drinking. Our old friend Southern (who hath ju&s;t left us) was in|vited to dinner once or twice by a judge, a bi|&s;hop, or a commi&s;&s;ioner of the revenues, but mo&s;t frequented a few particular friends, and chiefly the Doctor, who is ea&s;y in his fortune, and very ho&s;pitable. The conveniences of tak|ing the air, winter or &s;ummer, do far exceed tho&s;e in London. For the two large &s;trands ju&s;t at two ends of the town are as firm and dry in winter as in &s;ummer. There are at lea&s;t &s;ix or eight gentlemen of &s;en&s;e, learning, good|humour and ta&s;te, able and de&s;irous to plea&s;e you; and orderly females, &s;ome of the better &s;ort, to take care of you. The&s;e were the motives that
<PB N="248" REF="267">
I have frequently made u&s;e of to entice you hi|ther. And there would be no failure among the be&s;t people here, of any honours that could be done you. As to my&s;elf, I declare, my health is &s;o uncertain that I dare not venture among&s;t you at pre&s;ent. I hate the thoughts of London, where I am not rich enough to live otherwi&s;e than by &s;hifting, which is now too late. Nei|ther can I have conveniences in the country for three hor&s;es and two &s;ervants, and many others, which I have here at hand. I am one of the governors of all the hackney-coaches, carts, and carriages round this town, who dare not in&s;ult me, like your ra&s;cally waggoners or coach-men, but give me the way; nor is there one Lord or Squire for a hundred of yours, to turn me out of the road, or run over me with their coaches and &s;ix. Thus, I make &s;ome advantage of the public poverty, and give you the rea&s;ons for what I once writ, why I chu&s;e to be a freeman among &s;laves, rather than a &s;lave among free|men. Then, I walk the &s;treets in peace with|out being ju&s;tled, nor ever without a thou&s;and ble&s;&s;ings from my friends the vulgar. I am Lord Mayor of 120 hou&s;es, I am ab&s;olute Lord of the greate&s;t Cathedral in the kingdom, am at peace with the neighbouring Princes, the Lord Mayor of the city, and the Arch-bi&s;hop of Dublin, only the latter, like the K. of
<PB N="249" REF="268">
France, &s;ometimes attempts encroachments on my dominions, as old Lewis did upon Lor|rain. In the mid&s;t of this raillery, I can tell you with &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, that the&s;e advantages con|tribute to my ea&s;e, and therefore I value them. And in one part of your letter relating to my Lord B&mdash;and your &s;elf, you agree with me entirely, about the indifference, the love of quiet, the care of health, &amp;c. that grow upon men in years. And if you di&s;cover tho&s;e in|clinations in my Lord and your&s;elf, what can you expect from me, who&s;e health is &s;o pre|carious? and yet at your or his time of life, I could have leap'd over the moon.</P>

<P>I Have every day wi&s;h'd to write to you, to &s;ay a thou&s;and things; and yet, I think, I &s;hould not have writ to you now, if I was not &s;ick of writing any thing, &s;ick of my&s;elf, and (what is wor&s;e) &s;ick of my friends too. The world is become too bu&s;y for me; every body is &s;o concerned for the public, that all private enjoyments are lo&s;t, or di&s;-reli&s;h'd. I write more to &s;how you I am tired of this life, than to
<PB N="250" REF="269">
tell you any thing relating to it. I live as I did, I think as I did, I love you as I did; but all the&s;e are to no purpo&s;e: the world will not live, think, or love, as I do. I am troubled for, and vexed at, all my friends by turns. Here are &s;ome whom you love, and who love you; yet they receive no proofs of that affecti|on from you, and they give none of it to you. There is a great gulph between. In earne&s;t, I would go a thou&s;and miles by land to &s;ee you, but the &s;ea I dread. My ailments are &s;uch, that I really believe a &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s (con&s;idering the oppre&s;&s;ion of colical pains, and the great weakne&s;s of my brea&s;t) would kill me: and if I did not die of that, I mu&s;t of the exce&s;&s;ive eating and drinking of your ho&s;pitable town, and the exce&s;&s;ive flattery of your mo&s;t poetical country. I hate to be cramm'd, either way. Let your hungry Poets, and your rhyming Poets dige&s;t it, I cannot. I like much better to be abu&s;ed and half &s;tarved, than to be &s;o over-prai&s;ed and over-fed. Drown Ireland! for hav|ing caught you, and for having kept you: I only re&s;erve a little charity for her, for know|ing your value, and e&s;teeming you: You are the only Patriot I know, who is not hated for &s;erving his country. The man who drew your Character and printed it here, was not much in the wrong in many things he &s;aid of you:
<PB N="251" REF="270">
yet he was a very impertinent fellow, for &s;ay|ing them in words quite different from tho&s;e you had your&s;elf employed before on the &s;ame &s;ubject: for &s;urely to alter your words is to pre|judice them; and I have been told, that a man him&s;elf can hardly &s;ay the &s;ame thing twice over with equal happine&s;s; Nature is &s;o much a better thing than artifice.</P>
<P>I have written nothing this year: It is no af|fectation to tell you, my Mother's lo&s;s has turn|ed my frame of thinking. The habit of a whole life is a &s;tronger thing than all the rea&s;on in the world. I know I ought to be ea&s;y, and to be free; but I am dejected, I am confined: my whole amu&s;ement is in reviewing my pa&s;t life, not in laying plans for my future. I wi&s;h you cared as little for popular applau&s;e as I; as little for any nation, in contradi&s;tinction to o|thers, as I: and then I fancy, you that are not afraid of the &s;ea, you that are a &s;tronger man at &s;ixty than ever I was at twenty, would come and &s;ee &s;everal people who are (at la&s;t) like the primitive chri&s;tians, of one &s;oul and of one mind. The day is come, which I have often wi&s;hed, but never thought to &s;ee; when <HI>every mortal, that I e&s;teem, is of the &s;ame &s;entiment in Politics and in Religion.</HI></P>

<P>I Never think of you and can never write to you, now, without drawing many of tho&s;e &s;hort &s;ighs of which we have formerly talk'd: The reflection both of the friends we have been depriv'd of by Death, and of tho&s;e from whom we are &s;eparated almo&s;t as eternally by Ab|&s;ence, checks me to that degree that it takes away in a manner the plea&s;ure (which yet I feel very &s;en&s;ibly too) of thinking I am now con|ver&s;ing with you. You have been &s;ilent to me as to your Works; whether tho&s;e printed here are, or are not genuine? but one, I am &s;ure, is yours; and your method of concealing your &s;elf puts me in mind of the Indian bird I have read of, who hides his head in a hole, while all his feathers and tail &s;tick out. You'll have immediately by &s;everal franks (even before 'tis here publi&s;h'd) my Epi&s;tle to Lord Cobham, part of my <HI>Opus Magnum,</HI> and the la&s;t E&s;&s;ay on Man, both which, I conclude, will be grate|ful to your book&s;eller, on whom you plea&s;e to be&s;tow them &s;o early. There is a woman's war declar'd again&s;t me by a certain Lord; his weapons are the &s;ame which women and chil|dren u&s;e, a pin to &s;cratch, and a &s;quirt to be|&s;patter:

I writ a &s;ort of an&s;wer, but was a&s;hamed to enter the li&s;ts with him, and after &s;hewing it to &s;ome people, &s;uppre&s;s'd it: otherwi&s;e it was &s;uch as was worthy of him and worthy of me <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">It is printed, in this edition, at the end of the &s;econd Volume of Letters.</NOTE>. I was three weeks this autumn with Lord Pe|terborow, who rejoices in your doings, and al|ways &s;peaks with the greate&s;t affection of you. I need not tell you who el&s;e do the &s;ame; you may be &s;ure almo&s;t all tho&s;e whom I ever &s;ee, or de&s;ire to &s;ee. I wonder not that B&mdash;paid you no &s;ort of civility while he was in Ireland: he is too much a half-wit to love a true wit, and too much half-hone&s;t, to e&s;teem any entire merit. I hope and think he hates me too, and I will do my be&s;t to make him: he is &s;o in&s;upportably in&s;olent in his ci|vility to me when he meets me at one third place, that I mu&s;t affront him to be rid of it. That &s;trict neutrality as to public parties, which I have con&s;tantly ob&s;erv'd in all my writings, I think gives me the more title to attack &s;uch men, as &s;lander and belye my character in pri|vate, to tho&s;e who know me not. Yet even this is a liberty I will never take, unle&s;s at the &s;ame time they are Pe&s;ts of private &s;ociety, or mi&s;chievous members of the public, that is to &s;ay, unle&s;s they are enemies to all men as

<P>I Have ever thought you as &s;en&s;ible as any man I knew, of all the delicacies of friend|&s;hip, and yet I fear (from what Lord B. tells me you &s;aid in your la&s;t letter) that you did not quite under&s;tand the rea&s;on of my late &s;i|lence. I a&s;&s;ure you it proceeded wholly from the tender kindne&s;s I bear you. When the heart is full, it is angry at all words that cannot come up to it; and you are now the man in all
<PB N="255" REF="274">
the world I am mo&s;t troubled to write to, for you are the friend I have left whom I am mo&s;t grieved about. Death has not done wor&s;e to me in &s;eparating poor Gay, or any other, than di&s;ea&s;e and ab&s;ence in dividing us. I am afraid to know how you do, &s;ince mo&s;t accounts I have, give me pain for you, and I am unwil|ling to tell you the condition of my own health. If it were good, I would &s;ee you; and yet if I found you in that very condition of deafne&s;s, which made you fly from us while we were together, what comfort could we derive from it? In writing often I &s;hould find great relief, could we write freely; and yet, when I have done &s;o, you &s;eem by not an&s;wering in a very long time, to feel either the &s;ame unea&s;ine&s;s as I do, or to ab&s;tain, from &s;ome prudential rea|&s;on. Yet I am &s;ure, nothing that you and I wou'd &s;ay to each other, (tho' our own &s;ouls were to be laid open to the clerks of the po&s;t-office) could hurt either of us &s;o much, in the opinion of any hone&s;t man or good &s;ubject, as the intervening, officious, impertinence of tho&s;e Goers between us, who in England pretend to intimacies with you, and in Ireland to intima|cies with me. I cannot but receive any that call upon me in your name, and in truth they take it in vain too often. I take all opportu|nities of ju&s;tifying you again&s;t the&s;e Friends,
<PB N="256" REF="275">
e&s;pecially tho&s;e who know all you think and write, and repeat your &s;lighter ver&s;es. It is generally on &s;uch little &s;craps that Witlings feed, and 'tis hard the world &s;hould judge of our hou&s;e-keeping from what we fling to our dogs, yet this is often the con&s;equence. But they treat you &s;till wor&s;e, mix their own with yours, print them to get money, and lay them at your door. This I am &s;ati&s;|fied was the ca&s;e in the Epi&s;tle to a Lady; it was ju&s;t the &s;ame hand (if I have any judg|ment in &s;tyle) which printed your Life and Character before, which you &s;o &s;trongly di&s;|avow'd in your letters to Lord Carteret, my&s;elf, and others. I was very well informed of ano|ther fact, which convinced me yet more; the &s;ame per&s;on who gave this to be printed, offer'd to a book&s;eller a piece in pro&s;e as yours, and as commi&s;&s;ioned by you, which has &s;ince ap|pear'd, and been own'd to be his own. I think (I &s;ay once more) that I know your hand, tho' you did not mine in the E&s;&s;ay on Man. I beg your pardon for not telling you, as I &s;hould, had you been in England: but no &s;ecret can cro&s;s your Iri&s;h Sea, and every clerk in the po&s;t-office had known it. I fancy, tho' you lo&s;t &s;ight of me in the fir&s;t of tho&s;e E&s;&s;ays, you &s;aw me in the &s;econd. The de&s;ign of conceal|ing my&s;elf was good, and had its full effect;
<PB N="257" REF="276" MS="Y">
I was thought a Divine, a Philo&s;opher, and what not; and my doctrine had a &s;anction I could not have given to it. Whether I can pro|ceed in the &s;ame grave march like Lucretius, or mu&s;t de&s;cend to the gayeties of Horace, I know not, or whether I can do either? but be the future as it will, I &s;hall collect all the pa&s;t in one fair quarto this winter, and &s;end it you, where you will find frequent mention of your|&s;elf. I was glad you &s;uffer'd your writings to be collected more completely than hitherto, in the volumes I daily expect from Ireland; I wi&s;h'd it had been in more pomp, but that will be done by others: yours are beauties, that can never be too finely dre&s;t, for they will ever be young. I have only one piece of mercy to beg of you; do not laugh at my gravity, but permit me to wear the beard of a Philo&s;opher, till I pull it off, and make a je&s;t of it my&s;elf. 'Tis ju&s;t what my Lord B. is doing with Me|taphy&s;ics. I hope, you will live to &s;ee, and &s;tare at the learned figure he will make, on the &s;ame &s;helf with Locke and Malbranche.</P>
<P>You &s;ee how I talk to you (for this is not writing) if you like I &s;hould do &s;o, why not tell me &s;o? if it be the lea&s;t plea&s;ure to you, I will write once a week mo&s;t gladly; but can you ab&s;tract the letters from the per&s;on who writes them them, &s;o far, as not to feel more

<P>P. S.

<P>I Have yours with my Lord B&mdash;'s Po&s;t|&s;cript of September 15: it was long on its way, and for &s;ome weeks after the date I was very ill with my two inveterate di&s;orders, gid|dine&s;s and deafne&s;s The latter is pretty well off; but the other makes me totter towards evenings, and much di&s;pirits me. But I con|tinue to ride and walk, both of which, although they be no cures, are at lea&s;t amu&s;ements. I did never imagine you to be either incon&s;tant,
<PB N="260" REF="279">
or to want right notions of friend&s;hip, but I apprehend your want of health; and it hath been a frequent wonder to me how you have been able to entertain the world &s;o long, &s;o fre|quently, &s;o happily, under &s;o many bodily di&s;|orders. My Lord B. &s;ays you have been three months rambling, which is the be&s;t thing you can po&s;&s;ibly do in a &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on; and when the winter recalls you, we will, for our own intere&s;ts, leave you to your &s;peculations. God be thanked, I have done with every thing, and of every kind that requires writing, except now and then a letter, or, like a true old man, &s;crib|bling trifles only fit for children or &s;chool-boys of the lowe&s;t cla&s;s at be&s;t, which three or four of us read and laugh at to-day, and burn to|morrow. Yet, what is &s;ingular, I never am without &s;ome great work in view, enough to take up forty years of the mo&s;t vigorous healthy man: although I am convinced that I &s;hall never be able to fini&s;h three Treati&s;es, that have lain by me &s;everal years, and want nothing but correction. My lord B. &s;aid in his po&s;tcript, that you would go to Bath in three days: we &s;ince heard that you were dangerou&s;ly ill there, and that the news-mongers gave you over. But a gentleman of this kingdom, on his return from Bath, a&s;&s;ured me he left you well, and &s;o did
<PB N="261" REF="280">
&s;ome others whom I have forgot. I am &s;orry at my heart that you are pe&s;tered with people who come in my name, and I profe&s;s to you, it is without my knowledge. I am confident I &s;hall hardly ever have occa&s;ion again to re|commend, for my friends here are very few, and fixed to the free-hold, from whence no|thing but death will remove them. Surely I never doubted about your E&s;&s;ay on Man; and I would lay any odds, that I would never fail to di&s;cover you in &s;ix lines, unle&s;s you had a mind to write below or be&s;ide your&s;elf on purpo&s;e. I confe&s;s I did never imagine you were &s;o deep in Morals, or that &s;o many new and excellent rules could be produced &s;o advan|tageou&s;ly and agreeably in that &s;cience, from any one head. I confe&s;s in &s;ome few places I was forced to read twice, I believe I told you before what the Duke of D&mdash;&s;aid to me on that occa&s;ion, How a Judge here, who knows you, told him that on the fir&s;t reading tho&s;e E&s;|&s;ays, he was much plea&s;ed, but found &s;ome lines a little dark: On the &s;econd mo&s;t of them cleared up, and his plea&s;ure increa&s;ed: On the third he had no doubt remained, and then he admired the whole. My lord B&mdash;'s attempt of reducing Metaphy&s;ics to intelligible &s;en&s;e and u&s;efulne&s;s, will be a glorious undertaking, and

as I never knew him fail in any thing he at|tempted, if he had the &s;ole management, &s;o I am confident he will &s;ucceed in this.

I am happy that what you write is printed in large letters; otherwi&s;e between the weakne&s;s of my eyes, and the thickne&s;s of my hearing, I &s;hould lo&s;e the greate&s;t plea&s;ure that is left me. Pray command my lord B&mdash;to follow that ex|ample, if I live to read his Metaphy&s;ics. Pray God ble&s;s you both. I had a melancholy ac|count from the Doctor of his health.

<P>I Am truly &s;orry for any complaint you have, and it is in regard to the weakne&s;s of your eyes that I write (as well as print) in folio. You'll think (I know you will, for you have all the candor of a good under&s;tanding) that the thing which men of our age feel the mo&s;t, is the friend&s;hip of our equals; and that there|fore whatever affects tho&s;e who are &s;tept a few years before us, cannot but &s;en&s;ibly affect us who are to follow. It troubles me to hear you complain of your memory, and if I am in any part of my con&s;titution younger than you, it will be in my remembring every thing that has plea&s;ed me in you, longer than perhaps you will. The two &s;ummers we pa&s;s'd together dwell always on my mind, like a vi&s;ion which gave me a glymp&s;e of a better life and better com|pany, than this world otherwi&s;e afforded. I am now an individual, upon whom no other depends; and may go where I will, if the wretched carca&s;e I am annex'd to did not hin|der me. I rambled by very ea&s;y journeys this year to Lord Bathur&s;t and Lord Peterborow, who upon every occa&s;ion commemorate, love, and wi&s;h for you. I now pa&s;s my days be|tween
<PB N="264" REF="283">
Dawley, London, and this place, not &s;tudious, nor idle, rather poli&s;hing old works than hewing out new. I redeem now and then a paper that hath been abandon'd &s;everal years; and of this &s;ort you'll &s;oon &s;ee one, which I in|&s;cribe to our old friend Arbuthnot.</P>
<P>Thus far I had written, and thinking to fi|ni&s;h my letter the &s;ame evening, was prevented by company, and the next morning found my|&s;elf in a fever, highly di&s;order'd, and &s;o conti|nued in bed for five days, and in my chamber till now; but &s;o well recover'd as to hope to go abroad to-morrow, even by the advice of Dr. Arbuthnot. He him&s;elf, poor man, is much broke, tho' not wor&s;e than for the&s;e two la&s;t months he has been. He took extremely kind your letter. I wi&s;h to God we could once meet again, before that &s;eparation, which yet, I would be glad to believe, &s;hall re-unite us: But he who made us, not for ours but his purpo&s;es, knows only whether it be for the better or the wor&s;e, that the affections of this life &s;hould, or &s;hould not continue into the other: and doubtle&s;s it is as it &s;hould be. Yet I am &s;ure that while I am here, and the thing that I am, I &s;hall be imper|fect without the communication of &s;uch friends as you; you are to me like a limb lo&s;t, and bu|ried in another country; tho' we &s;eem quite divided, every accident makes me feel you were
<PB N="265" REF="284">
once a part of me. I always con&s;ider you &s;o much as a friend, that I forget you are an au|thor, perhaps too much, but 'tis as much as I would de&s;ire you would do to me. However, if I could in&s;pirit you to be&s;tow correction up|on tho&s;e three Treati&s;es, which you &s;ay are &s;o near completed, I &s;hould think it a better work than any I can pretend to of my own. I am al|mo&s;t at the end of my Morals, as I've been, long ago, of my Wit; my &s;y&s;tem is a &s;hort one, and my circle narrow. Imagination has no limits, and that is a &s;phere in which you may move on to eternity; but where one is confined to Truth (or to &s;peak more like a human creature, to the appearances of Truth) we &s;oon find the &s;hort|ne&s;s of our Tether. Indeed by the help of a metaphy&s;ical chain of Ideas, one may extend the circulation, go round and round for ever, without making any progre&s;s beyond the point to which Providence has pinn'd us: But this does not &s;atisfy me, who would rather &s;ay a little to no purpo&s;e, than a great deal. Lord B. is voluminous, but he is voluminous only to de&s;troy volumes. I &s;hall not live, I fear, to &s;ee that work printed; he is &s;o taken up &s;till (in &s;pite of the monitory hint given in the fir&s;t line of my E&s;&s;ay) with particular Men, that he neg|lects mankind, and is &s;till a creature of this world, not of the Univer&s;e: This World,
<PB N="266" REF="285">
which is a name we give to Europe, to Eng|land, to Ireland, to London, to Dublin, to the Court, to the Ca&s;tle, and &s;o dimini&s;hing, till it comes to our own affairs, and our own per&s;ons. When you write (either to him or to me, for we accept it all as one) rebuke him for it, as a Divine if you like it, or as a Badineur, if you think that more effectual.</P>
<P>What I write will &s;how you that my head is yet weak. I had written to you by that gentle|man from the Bath, but I did not know him, and every body that comes from Ireland pre|tends to be a friend of the Dean's. I am al|ways glad to &s;ee any that are truly &s;o, and therefore do not mi&s;take any thing I &s;aid, &s;o as to di&s;courage your &s;ending any &s;uch to me. Adieu.</P>

<P>YOUR letter was &s;ent me ye&s;terday by Mr. Stopford, who landed the &s;ame day, but I have not yet &s;een him. As to my &s;ilence, God knows it is my great misfortune. My little do|me&s;tic affairs are in great confu&s;ion by the vil|lainy

of agents, and the mi&s;eries of this king|dom, where there is no money to be had: nor am I unconcerned to &s;ee all things tending to|wards ab&s;olute power, in both nations<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Dean was fre|quently troubled, he tells us, with a <HI>giddine&s;s</HI> in his head.</NOTE> (it is here in perfection already) although I &s;hall not live to &s;ee it e&s;tabli&s;hed. This condition of things, both public and per&s;onal to my&s;elf, hath given me &s;uch a kind of de&s;pondency, that I am almo&s;t unqualified for any company, diver&s;ion, or amu&s;ement. The death of Mr. Gay and the Doctor, hath been terrible wounds near my heart. Their living would have been a great comfort to me, although I &s;hould ne|ver have &s;een them; like a &s;um of money in a bank, from which I &s;hould receive at lea&s;t an|nual intere&s;t, as I do from you, and have done from my Lord Bolingbroke. To &s;hew in how much ignorance I live, it is hardly a fortnight &s;ince I heard of the death of my Lady Ma|&s;ham, my con&s;tant friend in all changes of times. God forbid that I &s;hould expect you to make a voyage that would in the lea&s;t affect your health: but in the mean time how unhap|py am I, that my be&s;t friend &s;hould have per|haps the only kind of di&s;order for which a &s;ea|voyage is not in &s;ome degree a remedy?

<P>I have lately read a book imputed to Lord B. called a Di&s;&s;ertation upon Parties. I think it very ma&s;terly written.</P>

of two months ago, which complains of that profligate fellow Curl. I heartily wi&s;h you were what they call di&s;affected, as I am. I may &s;ay as David did, I have &s;inned greatly, but what have the&s;e &s;heep done? You have given no of|fence to the Mini&s;try, nor to the Lords, nor Commons, nor Queen, nor the next in Power. For you are a man of virtue, and therefore mu&s;t abhor vice and all corruption, although your di&s;cretion holds the reins. <Q>&startq;You need not fear any con&s;equence in the commerce that hath &s;o long pa&s;&s;ed between us; although I never de&s;troy'd one of your letters. But my Executors are men of honour and vir|tue, who have &s;trict orders in my will to burn every letter left behind me.&endq;</Q> Neither did our letters contain any Turns of Wit, or Fancy, or Politics, or Satire, but mere inno|cent Friend&s;hip: yet I am loth that any letters, from you and a very few other friends, &s;hould dye before me; I believe we neither of us ever leaned our head upon our left hand to &s;tudy what we &s;hould write next; yet we have held a con&s;tant intercour&s;e from your youth and my middle age, and from your middle age it mu&s;t be continued till my death, which my bad &s;tate of health makes me expect every month. I have the ambition, and it is very earne&s;t as well as in ha&s;te, to have one Epi&s;tle in&s;cribed to

I never heard of the man in my life, yet I find your name as a &s;ub&s;criber too. He is too grave a Poet for me, and, I think, among the <HI>medio|cribus</HI> in pro&s;e as well as ver&s;e. I have the honour to know Dr. Rundle; he is indeed worth all the re&s;t you ever &s;ent us, but that is &s;aying nothing, for he an&s;wers your character; I have dined thrice in his company. He brought over a worthy clergyman of this king|dom as his chaplain, which was a very wi&s;e and popular action. His only fault, is, that he drinks no wine, and I drink nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P>This kingdom is now ab&s;olutely &s;tarving, by the means of every oppre&s;&s;ion that can be in|flicted on mankind&mdash;Shall I not vi&s;it for the&s;e things? &s;aith the Lord. You advi&s;e me right, not to trouble my&s;elf about the world: But, oppre&s;&s;ion tortures me, and I cannot live with|out meat and drink, nor get either without money; and money is not to be had, except they will make me a Bi&s;hop, or a Judge, or a Colonel, or a Commi&s;&s;ioner of the Revenues.</P>

<P>I am glad you think of Dr. Rundle as I do. He will be an honour to the Bi&s;hops, and a di&s;grace to one Bi&s;hop, two things you will like: But what you will like more particularly, he will be a friend and benefactor even to your un-friended, un-benefited Nation; he will be a friend to human race, wherever he goes.

<P>I An&s;wer'd your letter relating to Curl, &amp;c. I believe my letters have e&s;cap'd being pub|li&s;h'd, becau&s;e I writ nothing but Nature and Friend&s;hip, and particular incidents which could make no figure in writing. I have ob|&s;erv'd that not only Voiture, but likewi&s;e Tully and Pliny writ their letters for the public view, more than for the &s;ake of their corre&s;pondents; and I am glad of it, on account of the Enter|tainment they have given me. Bal&s;ac did the &s;ame thing, but with more &s;tiffne&s;s, and con&s;e|quently le&s;s diverting: Now I mu&s;t tell you, that you are to look upon me as one going very fa&s;t out of the world; but my fle&s;h and bones are to be carried to Holy-head, for I will not lie in a Country of &s;laves.

I often ride a dozen miles, but I come to my own bed at night: My be&s;t way would be to marry, for in that ca&s;e any bed would be better than my own.

<P>I Cannot properly call you my be&s;t friend, becau&s;e I have not another left who de&s;erves the name, &s;uch a havock have Time, Death, Exile, and Oblivion made. Perhaps you would have fewer complaints of my ill health and lowne&s;s of &s;pirits, if they were not &s;ome ex|cu&s;e for my delay of writing even to you. It is perfectly right what you &s;ay of the indiffer|ence in common friends, whether we are &s;ick or well, happy or mi&s;erable. The very maid|&s;ervants in a family have the &s;ame notion: I have heard them often &s;ay, Oh, I am very &s;ick, if any body cared for it! I am vexed when my vi&s;iters come with the compliment u&s;ual here, Mr. Dean, I hope you are very well. My popularity that you mention, is wholly confined to the common people, who are more con|&s;tant than tho&s;e we mi&s;-call their betters. I walk the &s;treets, and &s;o do my lower friends, from whom and from whom alone, I have a thou&s;and hats and ble&s;&s;ings upon old &s;cores, which tho&s;e we call the Gentry have forgot. But I have not the love, or hardly the civility,

What hath &s;unk my &s;pirits more than even years and &s;ickne&s;s, is reflecting on the mo&s;t execrable Corruptions that run through every branch of public management.</P>
<P>I heartily thank you for tho&s;e lines tran&s;lated, <HI>Singula de nobis anni,</HI> &amp;c. You have put them in a &s;trong and admirable light; but however I am &s;o partial, as to be more delighted with tho&s;e which are to do me the greate&s;t honour I &s;hall ever receive from po&s;terity, and will outweigh the malignity of ten-thou&s;and ene|mies. I never &s;aw them before, by which it is plain that the letter you &s;ent me mi&s;carry'd.&mdash;I do not doubt that you have choice of new acquaintance, and &s;ome of them may be de&s;erving: For Youth is the &s;ea&s;on of Virtue; Corruptions grow with years, and I believe the olde&s;t rogue in England is the greate&s;t.

<P>IT is &s;ome time &s;ince I dined at the bi&s;hop of Derry's, where Mr. Secretary Cary told me with great concern, that you were taken very ill. I have heard nothing &s;ince, only I have continued in great pain of mind, yet for my own &s;ake and the world's more than for yours; becau&s;e I well know how little you va|lue life both as a Philo&s;opher and a Chri&s;tian, particularly the latter, wherein hardly one in a million of us heretics can equal you. If you are well recovered, you ought to be reproached for not putting me e&s;pecially out of pain, who could not bear the lo&s;s of you; although we mu&s;t be for ever di&s;tant as much as if I were in the grave, for which my years and continual indi&s;po&s;ition are preparing me every &s;ea&s;on.

<PB N="278" REF="297">
me &s;ome ca&s;e by an account of your health; pray do not u&s;e me &s;o ill any more. I look upon you as an e&s;tate from which I receive my be&s;t annual rents, although I am never to &s;ee it. Mr. Tickel was at the &s;ame meeting un|der the &s;ame real concern; and &s;o were a hun|dred others of this town who had never &s;een you.</P>
<P>I read to the Bi&s;hop of Derry the paragraph in your letter which concerned him, and his Lord&s;hip expre&s;s'd his thankfulne&s;s in a manner that became him. He is e&s;teemed here as a per&s;on of learning and conver&s;ation and huma|nity, but he is beloved by all people.</P>
<P>I have no-body now left but you: Pray, be &s;o kind to out-live me, and then die as &s;oon as you plea&s;e but without pain; and let us meet in a better place, if my Religion will permit, but rather my Virtue, although much unequal to yours. Pray, let my Lord Bathur&s;t know how much I love him; I &s;till in&s;i&s;t on his re|membring me, although he is too much in the world to honour an ab&s;ent friend with his let|ters. My &s;tate of health is not to boa&s;t of; my giddine&s;s is more or le&s;s too con&s;tant; I &s;leep ill, and have a poor appetite.

What vexes me mo&s;t is, that my &s;emale friends, who could bear me very well a dozen years ago, have now for&s;aken me, although I am not &s;o old in proportion to them, as I formerly was: which I can prove by Arithmetic, for then I was double their age, which now I am not. Pray, put me out of fear as &s;oon as you can, about that ugly report of your illne&s;s; and let me know who this Che&s;elden is, that hath &s;o lately &s;prung up in your favour? Give me al&s;o &s;ome account of your neighbour who writ to me from Bath: I hear he re&s;olves to be &s;trenuous for taking off the Te&s;t; which grieves me extremely, from all the unprejudiced Rea&s;ons I ever was able to form, and again&s;t the maxims of all wi&s;e Chri|&s;tian governments <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Author of the <HI>Di&s;&s;ertation on parties</HI> appears to be of the &s;ame opinion.</NOTE>, which always had &s;ome e&s;tabli&s;h'd Religion, leaving at be&s;t a toleration to others.</P>

<P>IF ever I write more Epi&s;tles in Ver&s;e, one of them &s;hall be addre&s;s'd to you. I have long concerted it, and begun it, but I would make what bears your name as fini&s;hed as my la&s;t work ought to be, that is to &s;ay, more fi|ni&s;hed than any of the re&s;t. The &s;ubject is large, and will divide into four Epi&s;tles, which naturally follow the E&s;&s;ay on Man, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. Of the Extent and Limits of Human Rea&s;on and Science. 2. A view of the u&s;eful and therefore attainable, and of the un-u&s;eful and therefore un-attainable, Arts. 3. Of the Nature, Ends, Application, and U&s;e of different Capacities. 4. Of the U&s;e of <HI>Learning,</HI> of the <HI>Science</HI> of the <HI>World,</HI> and of <HI>Wit.</HI> It will conclude with a Satire again&s;t the mi&s;-application of all the&s;e, exemplify'd by pictures, characters, and exam|ples.</P>
<P>But alas! the ta&s;k is great, and <HI>non &s;um qua|lis eram!</HI> My under&s;tanding indeed, &s;uch as it is, is extended rather than dimini&s;h'd: I &s;ee things more in the whole, more con&s;i&s;tent, and more clearly deduced from, and related to, each other. But what I gain on the &s;ide of philo&s;o|phy, I lo&s;e on the &s;ide of poetry: the flowers are gone, when the fruits begin to ripen, and
<PB N="281" REF="300">
the fruits perhaps will never ripen perfectly. The climate (under our Heaven of a Court) is but cold and uncertain; the winds ri&s;e, and the winter comes on. I find my&s;elf but little di&s;po&s;ed to build a new hou&s;e; I have nothing left but to gather up the reliques of a wreck, and look about me to &s;ee how few friends I have left. Pray, who&s;e e&s;teem or ad|miration &s;hould I de&s;ire now to procure by my writings? who&s;e friend&s;hip or conver&s;ation to obtain by 'em? I am a man of de&s;perate for|tunes, that is, a man who&s;e friends are dead: for I never aim'd at any other fortune than in friends. As &s;oon as I had &s;ent my la&s;t letter, I receiv'd a mo&s;t kind one from you, expre&s;&s;ing great pain for my late illne&s;s at Mr. Che&s;elden's. I conclude you was ea&s;ed of that friendly ap|prehen&s;ion in a few days after you had di&s;|patch'd yours, for mine mu&s;t have reached you then. I wondered a little at your quaere, who Che&s;elden was? It &s;hews that the true&s;t merit does not travel &s;o far any way as on the wings of poetry; he is the mo&s;t noted, and mo&s;t de|&s;erving man, in the whole profe&s;&s;ion of Chirur|gery; and has &s;av'd the lives of thou&s;ands by his manner of cutting for the &s;tone.&mdash;I am now well, or what I mu&s;t call &s;o.</P>

I can afford room for your&s;elf and two &s;ervants; I have indeed room enough, nothing but my&s;elf at home; the kind and hearty hou&s;e-wife is dead! the agreeable and in&s;tructive neighbour is gone! yet my hou&s;e is inlarg'd, and the gardens extend and flouri&s;h, as knowing nothing of the gue&s;ts they have lo&s;t. I have more fruit-trees and kitchen-garden than you have any thought of; nay I have good Melons and Pine-apples of my own growth.

How &s;hould I know Che&s;elden? On your &s;ide, men of fame &s;tart up and die be|fore we here (at lea&s;t I) know any thing of the matter. I am a little comforted with what you &s;ay of Lord B.'s Genius &s;till keeping up, and preparing to appear by effects worthy of the author, and u&s;eful to the world.&mdash;Common reports have made me very unea&s;y about your neighbour Mr. P. It is affirmed that he hath been very near death: I love him for being a Patriot in mo&s;t corrupted times, and highly e&s;teem his excellent under&s;tanding. Nothing

but the perver&s;e nature of my di&s;orders, as I have above de&s;cribed them, and which are ab|&s;olute di&s;qualifications for conver&s;e, could hin|der me from waiting on you at Twittenham, and nur&s;ing you to Paris. In &s;hort, my Ail|ments amount to a prohibition, although I am, as you de&s;cribe your&s;elf, what <HI>I mu&s;t call well,</HI> yet I have not &s;pirits left to ride out, which (excepting walking) was my only diver&s;ion. And I mu&s;t expect to decline every month, like one who lives upon his principal &s;um which mu&s;t le&s;&s;en every day; and indeed I am like|wi&s;e literally almo&s;t in the &s;ame ca&s;e, while every body owes me, and no-body pays me. In&s;tead of a young race of Patriots on your &s;ide, which gives me &s;ome glimp&s;e of joy, here we have the direct contrary, a race of young Dunces and Athei&s;ts, or old Villains and Mon&s;ters, whereof four fifths are more wicked and &s;tu|pid than Chartres. Your wants are &s;o few, that you need not be rich to &s;upply them; and my wants are &s;o many, that a King's &s;even millions of guineas would not &s;upport me.</P>

<P>I Find, tho' I have le&s;s experience than you, the truth of what you told me &s;ome time ago, that increa&s;e of years makes men more talkative but le&s;s writative: to that degree, that I now write no letters but of plain bu&s;ine&s;s, or plain how-d'ye's, to tho&s;e few I am forced to corre&s;pond with, either out of nece&s;&s;ity, or love: And I grow Laconic even beyond Laco|nici&s;me; for &s;ometimes I return only Yes, or No, to que&s;tionary or petitionary Epi&s;tles of half a yard long. You and Lord Bolingbroke are the only men to whom I write, and always in folio. You are indeed almo&s;t the only men I know, who either can write in this age, or who&s;e writings will reach the next: Others are mere mortals. Whatever failings &s;uch men may have, a re&s;pect is due to them, as Lumi|naries who&s;e exaltation renders their motion a little irregular, or rather cau&s;es it to &s;eem &s;o to others. I am afraid to cen&s;ure any thing I hear of Dean Swift, becau&s;e I hear it only from mortals, blind and dull: And you &s;hou'd be cautious of cen&s;uring any action or motion of Lord B. becau&s;e you hear it only from &s;hallow,

envious, or malicious reporters. What you writ to me about him I find to my great &s;can|dal repeated in one of yours to&mdash;. Whatever you might hint to me, was this for the pro|phane? the thing, if true, &s;hould be conceal'd; but it is, I a&s;&s;ure you, ab&s;olutely untrue, in eve|ry circum&s;tance. He has fixed in a very agree|able retirement near Fontainbleau, and makes it his whole bu&s;ine&s;s <HI>vacare literis.</HI> But tell me the truth, were you not angry at his omitting to write to you &s;o long? I may, for I hear from him &s;eldomer than from you, that is twice or thrice a year at mo&s;t. Can you po&s;&s;ibly think he can neglect you, or di&s;regard you? If you catch your&s;elf at thinking &s;uch non&s;en&s;e, your parts are decay'd: For, believe me, great Ge|nius's mu&s;t and do e&s;teem one another, and I que&s;tion if any others can e&s;teem or compre|hend uncommon merit. Others only gue&s;s at that merit, or &s;ee glimmerings of their minds: A genius has the intuitive faculty: Therefore, imagine what you will, you cannot be &s;o &s;ure of any man's e&s;teem as of his. If I can think that neither he nor you de&s;pi&s;e me, it is a greater honour to me by far, and will be thought &s;o by po&s;terity, than if all the Hou&s;e of Lords writ Commendatory Ver&s;es upon me, the Com|mons order'd me to print my Works, the Uni|ver&s;ities

<P>I Think you owe me a letter, but whether you do or not, I have not been in a condi|tion to write. Years and Infirmities have quite broke me; I mean that odious continual di&s;or|der in my head. I neither read, nor write, nor remember, nor conver&s;e. All I have left is to walk and ride; the fir&s;t I can do tolerably; but the latter, for want of good weather at this &s;ea|&s;on, is &s;eldom in my power; and having not an ounce of fle&s;h about me, my &s;kin comes off in ten miles riding, becau&s;e my &s;kin and bone can|not agree together. But I am angry, becau&s;e you will not &s;uppo&s;e me as &s;ick as I am, and write to me out of perfect charity, although I &s;hould not be able to an&s;wer. I have too many vexations by my &s;tation and the impertinence of people, to be able to bear the mortification of not hearing from a very few di&s;tant friends that are left; and, con&s;idering how time and fortune have ordered matters, I have hardly one friend left but your&s;elf.

My comfort is, you begun to di&s;tingui&s;h &s;o con|founded early, that your acquaintance with di&s;|tingui&s;h'd men of all kinds was almo&s;t as antient as mine. I mean Wycherly, Row, Prior, Con|greve, Addi&s;on, Parnel, &amp;c. and in &s;pite of your heart, you have owned me a Cotemporary. Not to mention Lords Oxford, Bolingbroke, Harcourt, Peterborow: In &s;hort, I was t'other day recollecting twenty-&s;even great Mini&s;ters, or Men of Wit and Learning, who are all dead, and all of my acquaintance, within twenty years pa&s;t; neither have I the grace to be &s;orry, that the pre&s;ent times are drawn to the dregs as well as my own life.&mdash;May my friends be happy in this and a better life, but I value not what be|comes of Po&s;terity when I con&s;ider from what Mon&s;ters they are to &s;pring.&mdash;My Lord Orrery writes to you to-morrow, and you &s;ee I &s;end this under his cover, or at lea&s;t franked by him.

<P>YOUR very kind letter has made me more melancholy, than almo&s;t any thing in this world now can do. For I can bear every thing in it, bad as it is, better than the complaints of my friends. Tho' others tell me you are in pretty good health, and in good &s;pirits, I find the contrary when you open your mind to me: And indeed it is but a prudent part, to &s;eem not &s;o concern'd about others, nor &s;o crazy our&s;elves as we really are: for we &s;hall neither be be|loved nor e&s;teem'd the more, by our common acquaintance, for any affliction or any infirmi|ty. But to our true friend we may, we mu&s;t complain, of what ('tis a thou&s;and to one) he complains with us; for if we have known him long, he is old, and if he has known the world long, he is out of humour at it. If you have but as much more health than others at your age, as you have more wit and good temper, you &s;hall not have much of my Pity: But if you ever live
<PB N="293" REF="316">
to have le&s;s, you &s;hall not have le&s;s of my Af|fection. A whole people will rejoyce at every year that &s;hall be added to you, of which you have had a late in&s;tance in the public rejoycings on your birth-day. I can a&s;&s;ure you, &s;omething better and greater than high birth and quality mu&s;t go toward acquiring tho&s;e demon&s;trations of public e&s;teem and love. I have &s;een a royal birth-day uncelebrated, but by one vile Ode, and one hired bonfire. Whatever years may take away from you, they will not take away the general e&s;teem, for your Sen&s;e, Virtue, and Charity.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t melancholy effect of years is that you mention, the catalogue of tho&s;e we lov'd and have lo&s;t, perpetually encrea&s;ing. How much that Reflection &s;truck me, you'll &s;ee from the Motto I have prefix'd to my Book of Let|ters, which &s;o much again&s;t my inclination has been drawn from me. It is from Catullus:

I detain this letter till I can find &s;ome &s;afe con|veyance; innocent as it is, and as all letters of mine mu&s;t be, of any thing to offend my &s;upe|riors, except the reverence I bear to true merit and virtue. "But I have much rea&s;on to fear, "tho&s;e which you have too partially kept in

your hands will get out in &s;ome very di&s;agree|able &s;hape, in ca&s;e of our mortality: and the more rea&s;on to fear it, &s;ince this la&s;t month Curl has obtain'd from Ireland two letters, (one of Lord Bolingbroke and one of mine, to you, which we wrote in the year 1723) and he has printed them, to the be&s;t of my memory, rightly, except one pa&s;&s;age concern|ing Dawley, which mu&s;t have been &s;ince in|&s;erted, &s;ince my Lord had not that place at that time. Your an&s;wer to that letter he has not got; it has never been out of my cu&s;to|dy; for whatever is lent is lo&s;t (Wit as well as Money) to the&s;e needy poetical Readers.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>The world will certainly be the better for his change of life. He &s;eems in the whole turn of his letters, to be a &s;ettled and principled Phi|lo&s;opher, thanking Fortune for the Tranquillity he has been led into by her aver&s;ion, like a man driven by a violent wind, from the &s;ea into a calm harbour. You a&s;k me, if I have got any &s;upply of new Friends to make up for tho&s;e that are gone? I think that impo&s;&s;ible, for not our friends only, but &s;o much of our&s;elves is gone by the mere flux and cour&s;e of years, that, were the &s;ame Friends to be re&s;tored to us, we could not be re&s;tored to our&s;elves, to enjoy them. But as when the continual wa&s;hing of a river takes away our flowers and plants, it

Thus I have acquired, without my &s;eeking, a few chance-acquaintance, of young men, who look rather to the pa&s;t age than the pre&s;ent, and therefore the future may have &s;ome hopes of them. If I love them, it is becau&s;e they honour &s;ome of tho&s;e whom I, and the world, have lo&s;t, or are lo&s;ing.

One or two are link'd to me by their love of the &s;ame &s;tudies and the &s;ame authors: but I will own to you, my moral capacity has got &s;o much the better of my poetical, that I have few acquaintance on the latter &s;core, and none without a ca&s;ting weight on the former.

<P>THO' you were never to write to me, yet what you de&s;ired in your la&s;t, that I would write often to you, would be a very ea&s;y ta&s;k; for every day I talk with you, and of you, in my heart; and I need only &s;et down what that is thinking of. The nearer I find my&s;elf verging
<PB N="297" REF="320">
to that period of life which is to be labour and &s;orrow, the more I prop my&s;elf upon tho&s;e few &s;upports that are left me. People in this &s;tate are like props indeed, they cannot &s;tand alone, but two or more of them can &s;tand, leaning and bearing upon one another. I wi&s;h you and I might pa&s;s this part of life together. My only nece&s;&s;ary care is at an end. I am now my own ma&s;ter too much; my hou&s;e is too large; my gardens furni&s;h too much wood and provi&s;ion for my u&s;e. My &s;ervants are &s;en&s;ible and ten|der of me; they have intermarried, and are be|come rather low friends than &s;ervants: and to all tho&s;e that I &s;ee here with plea&s;ure, they take a plea&s;ure in being u&s;eful. I conclude this is your ca&s;e too in your dome&s;tic life, and I &s;ome|times think of your old hou&s;e-keeper as my nur&s;e; tho' I tremble at the &s;ea, which only divides us. As your fears are not &s;o great as mine, and, I firmly hope, your &s;trength &s;till much greater, is it utterly impo&s;&s;ible, it might once more be &s;ome plea&s;ure to you to &s;ee England? My &s;ole motive in propo&s;ing France to meet in, was the narrowne&s;s of the pa&s;&s;age by &s;ea from hence, the Phy&s;icians having told me the weak|ne&s;s of my brea&s;t, &amp;c. is &s;uch, as a &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s might indanger my life. Tho' one or two of our friends are gone, &s;ince you &s;aw your native country, there remain a few more who will la&s;t

&s;o till death, and who, I cannot but hope, have an attractive power to draw you back to a Country, which cannot quite be &s;unk or en|&s;laved, while &s;uch &s;pirits remain. And let me tell you, there are a few more of the &s;ame &s;pi|rit, who would awaken all your old Ideas, and revive your hopes of her future recovery and Virtue. The&s;e look up to you with reverence, and would be animated by the &s;ight of him at who&s;e &s;oul they have taken fire, in his writings, and deriv'd from thence as much Love of their &s;pecies as is con&s;i&s;tent with a contempt for the knaves of it.</P>
<P>I could never be weary, except at the eyes, of writing to you; but my real rea&s;on (and a &s;trong one it is) for doing it &s;o &s;eldom, is Fear; Fear of a very great and experienced evil, that of my letters being kept by the partiality of friends, and pa&s;&s;ing into the hands, and malice of enemies; who publi&s;h them with all their Imperfections on their head; &s;o that I write not on the common terms of hone&s;t men.</P>

<P>I Sent a letter to you &s;ome weeks ago, which my Lord Orrery inclo&s;ed in one of his, to which I receiv'd as yet no an&s;wer, but it will be time enough when his Lord&s;hip goes over, which will be, as he hopes, in about ten days, and then he will take with him <Q>&startq;all the letters I pre&s;erved of yours, which are not above twenty-five. I find there is a great cha&s;m of &s;ome years, but the dates are more early than my two la&s;t journeys to England, which makes me imagine, that in one of tho&s;e journeys I carried over another Cargo.&endq;</Q> But I cannot tru&s;t my memory half an hour; and my di&s;orders of deafne&s;s and giddine&s;s increa&s;e daily. So that I am declining as fa&s;t as it is ea&s;ily po&s;&s;ible for me, if I were a dozen years older.</P>
<P>We have had your volume of letters, which, I am told, are to be printed here: Some of tho&s;e who highly e&s;teem you, and a few who know you per&s;onally, are grieved to find you make no di&s;tinction between the Engli&s;h Gentry of this Kingdom, and the &s;avage old Iri&s;h (who are only the vulgar, and &s;ome Gentlemen who
<PB N="303" REF="326">
live in the Iri&s;h parts of the Kingdom) but the Engli&s;h Colonies, who are three parts in four, are much more civilized than many Counties in England, and &s;peak better Engli&s;h, and are much better bred. And they think it very hard, that an American who is of the fifth generation from England, &s;hould be allowed to pre&s;erve that title, only becau&s;e we have been told by &s;ome of them that their names are entered in &s;ome pari&s;h in London. I have three or four Cou|&s;ins here who were born in Portugal, who&s;e pa|rents took the &s;ame care, and they are all of them Londoners. Dr. Delany, who, as I take it, is of an Iri&s;h family, came to vi&s;it me three days ago, on purpo&s;e to complain of tho&s;e pa&s;|&s;ages in your Letters; he will not allow &s;uch a difference between the two climates, but will a&s;&s;ert that North - Wales, Northumberland, York&s;hire, and the other Northern Shires have a more cloudy ungenial air than any part of Ireland. In &s;hort, I am afraid your friends and admirers here will force you to make a Pa|linody.</P>
<P>As for the other parts of your volume of Letters, my opinion is, that there might be collected from them the be&s;t Sy&s;tem that ever was wrote for the Conduct of human life, at lea&s;t to &s;hame all rea&s;onable men out of their Follies and Vices. It is &s;ome recommenda|tion
<PB N="304" REF="327">
of this Kingdom, and of the ta&s;te of the people, that you are at lea&s;t as highly cele|brated here as you are at home. If you will blame us for Slavery, Corruption, Athe|i&s;m, and &s;uch trifles, do it freely, but include England, only with an addition of every other Vice.&mdash;I wi&s;h you would give orders against the corruption of Engli&s;h by tho&s;e Scriblers, who &s;end us over their tra&s;h in Pro&s;e and Ver&s;e, with abominable curtailings and quaint modern|i&s;ms.&mdash;I now am daily expecting an end of life: I have lo&s;t all &s;pirit, and every &s;crap of health; I &s;ometimes recover a little of my hear|ing, but my head is ever out of order. While I have any ability to hold a commerce with you, I will never be &s;ilent, and this chancing to be a day that I can hold a pen, I will drag it as long as I am able. Pray let my Lord Or|rery &s;ee you often; next to your&s;elf I love no man &s;o well; and tell him what I &s;ay, if he vi|&s;its you. I have now done, for it is evening, and my head grows wor&s;e. May God always protect you, and pre&s;erve you long, for a pat|tern of Piety and Virtue.</P>
<P>Farewel, my deare&s;t and almo&s;t only con&s;tant friend. I am ever, at lea&s;t in my e&s;teem, ho|nour, and affection to you, what I hope you expect me to be,</P>

<P>I Have yours of July 25, and fir&s;t I de&s;ire you will look upon me as a man worn with years, and &s;unk by public as well as per&s;onal vexations. I have entirely lo&s;t my memory, uncapable of conver&s;ation by a cruel deafne&s;s, which has la&s;t|ed almo&s;t a year, and I de&s;pair of any cure. I &s;ay not this to encrea&s;e your compa&s;&s;ion (of which you have already too great a part) but as an excu&s;e for my not being regular in my Let|ters to you, and &s;ome few other friends. I have an ill name in the Po&s;t-Office of both Kingdoms, which makes the Letters addre&s;&s;ed to me not &s;eldom mi&s;carry, or be opened and read, and then &s;ealed in a bungling manner be|fore they come to my hands. Our friend Mrs. B. is very often in my thoughts, and high in my e&s;teem; I de&s;ire, you will be the me&s;&s;enger of my humble thanks and &s;ervice to her. That &s;uperior univer&s;al Genius you de&s;cribe, who&s;e hand-writing I know towards the end of your Letter, hath made me both proud and happy; but by what he writes I fear he will be too &s;oon gone to his Fore&s;t abroad. He began in the Queen's time to be my Patron, and then de|&s;cended to be my Friend.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="329">
It is a great favour of Heaven, that your health grows better by the addition of years. I have ab&s;olutely done with Poetry for &s;everal years pa&s;t, and even at my be&s;t times I could produce nothing but trifles: I therefore reject your compliments on that &s;core, and it is no compliment in me; for I take your &s;econd Dia|logue that you lately &s;ent me, to equal almo&s;t any thing you ever writ; although I live &s;o much out of the world, that I am ignorant of the facts and per&s;ons, which, I pre&s;ume, are very well known from Temple-bar to St. James's; (I mean the Court exclu&s;ive.)</P>
<Q>&startq;I can faithfully a&s;&s;ure you, that every let|ter you have favour'd me with, the&s;e twenty years and more, are &s;ealed up in bundles, and delivered to Mrs. W&mdash;, a very worthy, rational, and judicious Cou&s;in of mine, and the only relation who&s;e vi&s;its I can &s;uffer: All the&s;e Letters &s;he is directed to &s;end &s;afely to you upon my decea&s;e.&endq;</Q>
<P>My Lord Orrery is gone with his Lady to a part of her e&s;tate in the North: She is a per|&s;on of very good under&s;tanding as any I know of her &s;ex. Give me leave to write here a &s;hort an&s;wer to my Lord B's letter in the la&s;t page of yours.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am more and more con|vinced that your letters are neither lo&s;t nor burnt: but who the Dean means by a <HI>&s;afe hand</HI> in Ireland, is beyond my power of gue&s;&s;ing, tho' I am particularly acquainted with mo&s;t, if not all, of his friends. As I know you had the recovery of tho&s;e Letters at heart, I took more than ordinary pains, to find out where they were; but my en|quiries were to no purpo&s;e, and, I fear, whoever has them, is too tenacious of them to di&s;|cover where they lie. <Q>&startq;Mrs. W&mdash;did a&s;&s;ure me &s;he had not one of them, and &s;eem'd to be under great unea&s;ine&s;s that you &s;hould imagine they were left with her.

<P>You may make what u&s;e you plea&s;e, either to the Dean or any other per&s;on, of what I have told you.

<P>I Saw Mr. M. ye&s;terday who has rea|dily allowed Mr. V. to copy the Pic|ture. I have enquired for the be&s;t Originals of tho&s;e two &s;ubjects, which, I found, were fa|vorite ones with you, and well de&s;erve to be &s;o, the Di&s;covery of Jo&s;eph to his Brethren, and the Re&s;ignation of the Captive by Scipio. Of the latter, my Lord Burlington has a fine one done by Ricci, and I am promi&s;ed the other in a good Print from one of the chief Italian Paint|ers. That of Scipio is of the exact &s;ize one would wi&s;h for a Ba&s;&s;o Relievo, in which man|ner, in my opinion, you would be&s;t ornament your Hall, done in Chiaro o&s;curo.</P>
<P>A man not only &s;hews his Ta&s;te, but his

Virtue, in the choice of &s;uch ornaments: And whatever example mo&s;t &s;trikes us, we may rea|&s;onably imagine, may have an influence upon others. So that the Hi&s;tory it&s;elf, if well cho|&s;en, upon a rich man's walls, is very often a better le&s;&s;on than any he could teach by his conver&s;ation. In this &s;en&s;e, the Stones may be &s;aid to &s;peak when Men cannot, or will not. I can't help thinking (and I know you'll join with me, you who have been making an Al|tar-piece) that the zeal of the fir&s;t Reformers was ill placed, in removing <HI>pictures</HI> (that is to &s;ay, examples) out of Churches; and yet &s;uffer|ing <HI>Epitaphs</HI> (that is to &s;ay, flatteries and fal&s;e hi&s;tory) to be the burthen of Church walls, and the &s;hame, as well as deri&s;ion, of all ho|ne&s;t men.</P>

<P>I Need not &s;ay I thank you for a Letter, which proves &s;o much friend&s;hip for me. I have much more to &s;ay upon it than I can, till we meet. But, in a word, I think your notion of the value of tho&s;e things<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">His Letters.</NOTE> is greatly too high, as to any &s;ervice they can do to the public; and, as to any advantage they may do to my own Character, I ought to be content with what they have done already. I a&s;&s;ure you, I do not think it the lea&s;t of tho&s;e advantages that they have occa&s;ioned me the good-will (in &s;o great a degree) of &s;o worthy a man <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Mr. Allen's friend&s;hip with the Author was con|tracted on the &s;ight of his Letters, which gave the for|mer the highe&s;t opinion of the other's general benevo|lence and goodne&s;s of heart.</NOTE>. I fear (as I mu&s;t rather retrench than add to their number, unle&s;s I would publi&s;h my own commendations) that the common run of Sub&s;cribers would think them&s;elves injured by not having every thing, which di&s;cretion mu&s;t &s;uppre&s;s; and this, they (without any other con&s;ideration than as buyers of a book) would call giving them an imperfect collection: whereas the only u&s;e to my own character, as
<PB N="313" REF="336">
an Author, of &s;uch a publication, would be the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of many things: and as to my character as a Man, it would be but ju&s;t where it is; unle&s;s I could be &s;o vain, for it could not be virtuous, to add more and more hone&s;t &s;entiments; which, when done <HI>to be printed,</HI> would &s;urely be wrong and weak al&s;o.</P>
<P>I do grant it would be &s;ome plea&s;ure to me to expunge &s;everal idle pa&s;&s;ages, which will otherwi&s;e, if not go down to the next age, pa&s;s, at lea&s;t, in this, for mine; altho' many of them were not, and, God knows, none of them are my pre&s;ent &s;entiments, but, on the contrary, wholly di&s;approved by me.</P>
<P>And I do not flatter you when I &s;ay, that plea&s;ure would be increa&s;ed to me, in know|ing I &s;hould do what would plea&s;e <HI>you.</HI> But I cannot per&s;uade my&s;elf to let the whole bur|den, even tho' it were a public good, lie upon you, much le&s;s to &s;erve my private fame entire|ly at another's expence <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Mr. A. offered to print the Letters at his own ex|pence.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But, under&s;tand me rightly&punc; Did I believe half &s;o well of them as you do, I would not &s;cruple your a&s;&s;i&s;tance; becau&s;e I am &s;ure, that to occa&s;ion you to contribute to a real good would be the greate&s;t benefit I could oblige you in. And I hereby promi&s;e you, if ever I

<P>As to the pre&s;ent affair; that you may be convinced what weight your opinion and your de&s;ires have with me, I will do what I have not yet done: I will tell my Friends I am as willing to publi&s;h this book as to let it alone. And, rather than &s;uffer you to be taxed at your own rate, will publi&s;h, in the News, next win|ter, the Propo&s;als, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I tell you all the&s;e particulars to &s;hew you how willing I am to follow your advice, nay, to accept your a&s;&s;i&s;tance in any moderate de|gree. But I think you &s;hould re&s;erve &s;o great a proof of your benevolence to a better occa|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Since I wrote la&s;t, I have found, on further inquiry, that there is another fine picture on the &s;ubject of Scipio and the Captive, by Pietro da Cortona, which Sir Paul Methuen has a &s;ketch of: and, I believe, is more expre&s;&s;ive than that of Ricci, as Pietro is famous for expre&s;&s;ion. I have al&s;o met with a fine Print of the di&s;co|very of Jo&s;eph to his Brethren, a de&s;ign, which, I fancy, is of La Sueur, and will do perfectly well.</P>

<P>I Do not write too often to you for many rea&s;ons; but one, which I think a good one, is, that Friends &s;hould be left to think of one another for certain intervals without too frequent memorandums: it is an exerci&s;e of their friend&s;hip, and a trial of their memory: and moreover to be perpetually repeating a&s;&s;u|rances, is both a needle&s;s and &s;u&s;picious kind of treatment with &s;uch as are &s;incere: not to add the tautology one mu&s;t be guilty of, who can make out &s;o many idle words as to fill pages with &s;aying one thing.

<P>Talking of works, mine in pro&s;e are above three quarters printed, and will be a book of fifty and more&punc;&s;heets in quarto.

<P>THE event<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Queen's death.</NOTE> of this week or fortnight has filled every body's mind and mine &s;o much, that I could not get done what you de|&s;ired as to Dr. P. but as &s;oon as I can get home, where my books lie, I will &s;end them to Mr. K. The death of great per&s;ons is &s;uch a &s;ort of &s;urprize to <HI>all,</HI> as every one's death is to him&s;elf, tho' both &s;hould equally be expected and prepared for. We begin to e&s;teem and commend our &s;uperiors, at the time that we pity them, becau&s;e then they &s;eem not above our&s;elves. The Queen &s;hewed, by the con|fe&s;&s;ion of all about her, the utmo&s;t firmne&s;s and temper to her la&s;t moments, and thro' the cour&s;e of great torments. What character hi|&s;torians will allow her, I do not know; but all her dome&s;tic &s;ervants, and tho&s;e neare&s;t her, give her the be&s;t te&s;timony, that of &s;incere tears. But the Public is always hard; rigid at be&s;t, even when ju&s;t, in its opinion of any one. The only plea&s;ure which any one, either of high or low rank, mu&s;t depend upon receiving, is in the candour or partiality of friends, and that &s;mall circle we are conver&s;ant in: and it is therefore the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction to &s;uch as wi&s;h us well,

to know we enjoy that. I therefore thank you particularly for telling me of the continuance, or rather increa&s;e of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings which make your dome&s;tic life happy.

<P>IT is a pain to me to hear your old complaint &s;o trouble&s;ome to you; and the &s;hare I have borne, and &s;till bear too often, in the &s;ame com|plaint, gives me a very feeling &s;en&s;e of it. I hope we agree in every other &s;en&s;ation be&s;ides this; for your <HI>heart</HI> is always right, whatever your body may be. I will venture too to &s;ay, my body is the wor&s;t part of me, or God have mercy on my &s;oul. I can't help telling you the rapture you accidentally gave the poor wo|man (for whom you left a Guinea, on what I told you of my finding her at the end of my garden) I had no notion of her want being &s;o great, as I then told you, when I gave her half a one. But I find I have a plea&s;ure to come, for I will allow her &s;omething yearly, and that may be but one year, for, I think, by her looks &s;he is not le&s;s than eighty. I am determined to
<PB N="320" REF="343">
take this charity out of your hands, which, I know, you'll think hard upon you. But &s;o it &s;hall be.</P>
<P>Pray tell me if you have any objection to my putting your name into a poem of mine (inci|dentally, not at all going out of the way for it) provided I &s;ay &s;omething of you, which mo&s;t people would take ill, for example, that you are no man of high birth or quality? You mu&s;t be perfectly free with me on this, as on any, nay, on every other occa&s;ion.</P>

<P>I Ought &s;ooner to have acknowledged yours; but I have been &s;everely handled by my A&s;thma, and, at the &s;ame time, hurried by bu|&s;ine&s;s that gave an increa&s;e to it by catching cold. I am truly &s;orry to find that neither yours nor Mrs. A.'s di&s;order is totally removed: but God forbid your pain &s;hould continue to return every day, which is wor&s;e by much
<PB N="321" REF="344">
than I expected to hear. I hope your next will give me a better account. Poor Mr. Be|thel too is very ill in York&s;hire. And, I do a&s;&s;ure you, there are no two men I wi&s;h better to. I have known and e&s;teemed him for every moral virtue the&s;e twenty years and more. He has all the charity, without any of the weak|ne&s;s of&mdash;; and, I firmly believe, never &s;aid a thing he did not think, nor did a thing he could not tell. I am concerned he is in &s;o cold and remote a place, as in the Wolds of York|&s;hire, at a hunting-&s;eat. If he lives till &s;pring, he talks of returning to London, and, if I po&s;|&s;ibly can, I would get him to lye out of it at Twickenham, tho' we went backward and forward every day in a warm coach, which would be the propere&s;t exerci&s;e for both of us, &s;ince he is become &s;o weak as to be deprived of riding a hor&s;e.</P>
<P>L. Bolingbroke &s;tays a month yet, and I hope Mr. Warburton will come to town before he goes. They will both be plea&s;ed to meet each other; and nothing, in all my life, has been &s;o great a plea&s;ure to my nature, as to bring de&s;erving and knowing men together. It is the greate&s;t favour that can be done, either to great genius's or u&s;eful men.

<P>I Thank you very kindly for yours. I am &s;ure we &s;hall meet with the &s;ame hearts we ever met; and I could wi&s;h it were at Twick|enham, tho' only to &s;ee you and Mrs. Allen twice there in&s;tead of once. But, as matters have turned out, a decent obedience to the go|vernment has &s;ince obliged me to re&s;ide here, ten miles out of the capital; and therefore I mu&s;t &s;ee you here or no where. Let that be an additional rea&s;on for your coming and &s;tay|ing what time you can.</P>
<P>The utmo&s;t I can do, I will venture to tell you in your ear. I may &s;lide along the Surrey &s;ide (where no Middle&s;ex ju&s;tice can pretend any cognizance) to Batter&s;ea, and thence cro&s;s the water for an hour or two, in a clo&s;e chair, to dine with you, or &s;o. But to be in town, I

fear, will be imprudent, and thought in&s;olent. At lea&s;t, hitherto, all comply with the pro|clamation <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">On the Inva&s;ion, at that time threatened from France and the Pretender.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I write thus early, that you may let me know if your day continues, and I will have every room in my hou&s;e as warm for you as the own|er always would be. It may po&s;&s;ibly be, that I &s;hall be taking the &s;ecret flight I &s;peak of to Batter&s;ea, before you come, with Mr. Warbur|ton, whom I have promi&s;ed to make known to the only great man in Europe, who knows as much as He. And from thence we may re|turn the 16th, or any day, hither, and meet you, without fail, if you fix your day.</P>
<P>I would not make ill health come into the &s;cale, as to keeping me here (tho', in truth, it now bears very hard upon me again, and the lea&s;t accident of cold, or motion almo&s;t, throws me into a very dangerous and &s;uffering condi|tion.) God &s;end you long life, and an ea&s;ier enjoyment of your breath than I now can ex|pect, I fear, &amp;c.</P>

<P>IT is a real truth that I &s;hould have written to you oftener, if I had not a great re&s;pect for you, and owed not a great debt to you.

<P>IT is true that I am a very unpunctual cor|re&s;pondent, tho' no unpunctual agent or friend; and that, in the commerce of words, I am both poor and lazy. Civility and Com|pliment generally are the goods that letter|writers exchange, which, with hone&s;t men, &s;eems a kind of illicite trade, by having been, for the mo&s;t part carried on, and carried fur|the&s;t by de&s;igning men. I am therefore re|duced to plain enquiries, how my friend does, and what he does? and to repetitions, which I am afraid to tire him with, <HI>how much I love him.</HI> Your two kind letters gave me real &s;atis|faction, in hearing you were &s;afe and well; and in &s;hewing me you took kindly my unaf|fected endeavours to prove my e&s;teem for you, and delight in your conver&s;ation. Indeed my languid &s;tate of health, and frequent deficiency of &s;pirits, together with a number of di&s;&s;ipa|tions, <HI>et aliena negotia centum,</HI> all con&s;pire to throw a faintne&s;s and cool appearance over my

conduct to tho&s;e I be&s;t love; which I perpetu|ally feel, and grieve at: But in earne&s;t, no man is more deeply touched with merit in ge|neral, or with particular merit towards me, in any one. You ought therefore in both views to hold your&s;elf what you are to me in my opinion and affection; &s;o high in each, that I may perhaps &s;eldom attempt to tell it you. The greate&s;t ju&s;tice, and favour too that you can do me, is to take it for granted.</P>
<P>Do not therefore commend my talents, but in&s;truct me by your own. I am not really learned enough to be a judge in works of the nature and depth of yours. But I travel thro' your book as thro' an amazing &s;cene of ancient Egypt or Greece; &s;truck with veneration and wonder; but at every &s;tep wanting an in&s;truc|tor to tell me all I wi&s;h to know. Such you prove to me in the walks of antiquity; and &s;uch you will prove to all mankind: but with this additional character, more than any other &s;earcher into antiquities, that of a genius equal to your pains, and of a ta&s;te equal to your learning.</P>
<P>I am obliged greatly to you, for what you have projected at Cambridge, in relation to my E&s;&s;ay <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pope de&s;ired the editor to procure a good tran&s;lation of the <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Man</HI> into latin pro&s;e.</NOTE>; but more for the motive which did

<P>I Am always naturally &s;paring of my letters to my Friends; for a rea&s;on I think a great one; that it is needle&s;s after experience, to re|peat a&s;&s;urances of Friend&s;hip; and no le&s;s irk|&s;ome to be &s;earching for words, to expre&s;s it over and over. But I have more calls than one for this letter. Fir&s;t, to expre&s;s a &s;atisfaction at your re&s;olution not to keep up the ball of di&s;pute with Dr. M. tho', I am &s;atisfied, you could have done it; and to tell you that Mr. L. is plea&s;ed at it too, who writes me word upon this occa&s;ion, that he mu&s;t infinitely e&s;teem a Divine, and an Author who loves Peace better than Victory. Secondly, I am to recom|mend to you as an author, a book&s;eller in the room of the hone&s;t one you have lo&s;t, Mr. G. and I know none who is &s;o worthy, and has &s;o good a title in that character to &s;ucceed him as Mr. Knapton. But my third motive of now troubling you is my own proper intere&s;t and plea&s;ure. I am here in more lei&s;ure than I can po&s;&s;ibly enjoy even in my own hou&s;e, <HI>vacare literis.</HI> It is at this place, that your ex|hortations may be mo&s;t effectual, to make me re&s;ume the &s;tudies I have almo&s;t laid a&s;ide, by
<PB N="345" REF="368">
perpetual avocations and di&s;&s;ipations. If it were practicable for you to pa&s;s a month or &s;ix weeks from home, it is here I could wi&s;h to be with you: And if you would attend to the continu|ation of your own noble work, or unbend to the idle amu&s;ement of commenting upon a poet, who has no other merit, than that of aiming by his moral &s;trokes to merit &s;ome re|gard from &s;uch men as advance Truth and Vir|tue in a more effectual way; in either ca&s;e, this place and this hou&s;e would be an inviola|ble a&s;ylum to you, from all you would de&s;ire to avoid, in &s;o public a &s;cene as Bath. The worthy man, who is the ma&s;ter of it, invites you in the &s;tronge&s;t terms; and is one who would treat you with love and veneration, ra|ther than what the world calls civility and re|gard. He is &s;incerer and plainer than almo&s;t any man now in this world, <HI>antiquis moribus.</HI> If the waters of the Bath may be &s;erviceable to your complaints (as I believe from what you have told me of them) no opportunity can ever be better. It is ju&s;t the be&s;t &s;ea&s;on. We are told the Bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury is expected here daily, who, I know, is your friend: at lea&s;t, though a bi&s;hop, is too much a man of learn|ing to be your enemy. You &s;ee I omit nothing to add to the weight in the balance, in which,
<PB N="346" REF="369">
however, I will not think my&s;elf light, &s;ince I have known your partiality. You will want no &s;ervant here. Your room will be next to mine, and one man will &s;erve us. Here is a Library and a Gallery ninety feet long to walk in, and a coach whenever you would take the air with me. Mr. ALLEN tells me, you might on hor&s;eback be here in three days; it is le&s;s than 100 miles from Newarke, the road through Leice&s;ter, Stow in the Wolde in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, and Cirence&s;ter by Lord Ba|thur&s;t's. I could engage to carry you to Lon|don from hence, and I would accommodate my time and journey to your conveniency.</P>

<P>I Am forced to grow every day more laconic in my letters, for my eye&s;ight grows every day &s;horter and dimmer. Forgive me then that I an&s;wer you &s;ummarily. I can even le&s;s bear an equal part in a corre&s;pondence than in a conver|&s;ation with you. But be a&s;&s;ured once for all, the more I read of you, as the more I hear from you, the better I am in&s;tructed and plea&s;ed. And this misfortune of my own dulne&s;s, and my own ab&s;ence, only quickens my ardent wi&s;h that &s;ome good fortune would draw you nearer, and enable me to enjoy both, for a greater part of our lives in this neighbourhood; and in &s;uch a &s;itua|tion, as might make more beneficial friends, than I, e&s;teem and enjoy you equally.&mdash;I have again heard from Lord * * and another hand, that the Lord I writ to you of, declares an intention to &s;erve you. My an&s;wer (which they re|lated to him) was, that he would be &s;ure of your acquaintance for life, if once he &s;erved,
<PB N="354" REF="377">
or obliged you; but that, I was certain, you would never trouble him with your expectation, tho' he would never get rid of your gratitude.&mdash;Dear Sir, adieu, and let me be &s;ometimes certified of your health. My own is as u&s;ual; and my affection the &s;ame, always yours.</P>

<P>I Write to you among&s;t the very few I now de&s;ire to have my Friends, merely, <HI>Si valeas, valeo.</HI> 'Tis in effect all I &s;ay: but it is very literally true, for I place all that makes my life de&s;irable in their welfare. I may truly affirm, that vanity or intere&s;t have not the lea&s;t &s;hare in any friend&s;hip I have; or cau&s;e me now to cultivate that of any one man by any one let|ter. But if any motive &s;hould draw me to flat|ter a great man, it would be to &s;ave the friend I would have him &s;erve from doing it. Rather than lay a de&s;erving per&s;on under the nece&s;&s;ity of it, I would hazard my own character and keep his in dignity. Tho', in truth, I live in a time when no mea&s;ures of conduct influence the &s;ucce&s;s of one's applications, and the be&s;t thing to tru&s;t to is chance and opportunity.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="378">
I only meant to tell you, I am wholly yours, how few words &s;o ever I make of it.&mdash;A greater plea&s;ure to me is, that I chanced to make Mr. Allen &s;o, who is not only worth more than&mdash;intrin&s;ically; but, I fore&s;ee, will be effectually more a comfort and glory to you every year you live. My confidence in any man le&s;s truly great than an hone&s;t one is but &s;mall.&mdash;</P>
<P>I have lived much by my&s;elf of late, partly thro' ill health, and partly to amu&s;e my&s;elf with little improvements in my garden and hou&s;e, to which po&s;&s;ibly I &s;hall (if I live) be &s;oon more confined. When the Dunciad may be pub|li&s;hed I know not. I am more de&s;irous of car|rying on the be&s;t, that is your edition of the re&s;t of the <HI>Epi&s;tles</HI> and <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Critici&s;m,</HI> &amp;c. I know it is there I &s;hall be &s;een mo&s;t to advan|tage. But I in&s;i&s;t on one condition, that you never think of this when you can employ your|&s;elf in fini&s;hing that noble work of the <HI>Divine Legation</HI> (which is what, above all, <HI>iterum ite|rumque monebo)</HI> or any other u&s;eful &s;cheme of your own. It would be a &s;atisfaction to me at pre&s;ent only to hear that you have &s;upported your health among the&s;e epidemical di&s;orders, which, tho' not mortal to any of my friends, have afflicted almo&s;t every one.</P>

<P>I Wi&s;h that, in&s;tead of writing to you once in two months, I could do you &s;ome &s;ervice as often; for I am arrived to an age when I am as &s;paring of words as mo&s;t old men are of mo|ney, though I daily find le&s;s occa&s;ion for any. But I live in a time when benefits are not in the power of an hone&s;t man to be&s;tow; nor indeed of an hone&s;t man to receive, con&s;i|dering on what terms they are generally to be had. It is certain you have a full right to any I could do you, who not only monthly, but weekly of late, have loaded me with favours of that kind, which are mo&s;t acceptable to ve|teran Authors; tho&s;e garlands which a Com|mentator weaves to hang about his Poet, and which are flowers both of his own gathering and painting too; not blo&s;&s;oms &s;pringing from the dry Author.</P>
<P>It is very unrea&s;onable after this, to give you a &s;econd trouble in revi&s;ing the<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Editor did revi&s;e and correct it as it now &s;tands in the la&s;t edition.</NOTE> <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Homer.</HI> But I look upon you as one &s;worn to &s;uffer no errors in me: and tho' the common way with a Commentator be to erect them into beauties, the be&s;t office of a Critic is to correct and amend
<PB N="357" REF="380">
them. There being a new edition coming out of <HI>Homer,</HI> I would willingly render it a little le&s;s defective, and the book&s;eller will not allow me time to do &s;o my&s;elf.&mdash;</P>
<P>Lord B. returns to France very &s;peedily, and it is po&s;&s;ible I may go for three weeks or a month to Mr. Allen's in the &s;ummer; of which I will not fail to adverti&s;e you, if it &s;uits your conveniency to be there and drink the waters more beneficially.</P>
<P>Forgive my &s;cribling &s;o ha&s;tily and &s;o ill. My eyes are at lea&s;t as bad as my head: and it is with my heart only that I can pretend to be, to any real purpo&s;e,</P>

<P>YOU may well expect letters from me of thanks: but the kind attention you &s;hew to every thing that concerns me is &s;o manife&s;t, and &s;o repeated, that you cannot but tell your|&s;elf how nece&s;&s;arily I mu&s;t pay them in my heart, which makes it almo&s;t impertinent to &s;ay &s;o. Your alterations to the Preface and E&s;&s;ay<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Prefix'd to his Homer's Iliad.</NOTE> are ju&s;t; and none more obliging to me than where you prove your concern, that my notions in my fir&s;t writings &s;hould not be repug|nant
<PB N="358" REF="381">
to tho&s;e in my la&s;t. And you will have the charity to think, when I was then in an er|ror, it was not &s;o much that I thought wrong or perver&s;ely, as that I had not thought &s;ufficient|ly. What I could correct in the di&s;&s;ipated life I am forced to lead here, I have: and &s;ome there are which &s;till want your help to be made as they &s;hould be.&mdash;Mr. Allen depends on you at the end of the next month or in September, and I will join him as &s;oon as I can return from the other party. I believe not till Sep|tember at &s;oone&s;t.&mdash;You will pardon me (dear Sir) for writing to you but ju&s;t like an attorney or agent. I am more concerned for your Finances<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">His debt from the Executor of Mr. G.</NOTE> than your Fame; becau&s;e the fir&s;t, I fear, you will never be concerned about your|&s;elf; the &s;econd is &s;ecure to you already, and (whether you will or not) will follow you.</P>
<P>I have never &s;aid one word to you of the pub|lic. I have known the greater world too long to be very &s;anguine. But accidents and occa&s;ions may do what Virtue would not; and God &s;end they may! Adieu. Whatever becomes of public Virtue, let us pre&s;erve our own poor &s;hare of the private. Be a&s;&s;ured, if I have any, I am with a true &s;en&s;e of your merit and friend&s;hip, &amp;c.</P>

<P>I Heartily thank you for yours, from which I learn'd your &s;afe arrival. And that you you found all yours in health, was a kind ad|dition to the account; as I truly am intere&s;ted in whatever is, and de&s;erves to be dear to you, and to make a part of your happine&s;s. I have many rea&s;ons and experiences to convince me, how much you wi&s;h health to me, as well as long life to my writings. Could you make as much a better man of me as you can make a better author, I were &s;ecure of Immortality both here and hereafter by your means.

<P>AN unwillingne&s;s to write nothing to you, whom I re&s;pect; and wor&s;e than nothing (which would afflict you) to one who wi&s;hes me &s;o well, has hitherto kept me &s;ilent. Of the Public I can tell you nothing worthy the re|flection of a rea&s;onable man; and of my&s;elf on|ly
<PB N="360" REF="383">
an account that would give you pain; for my a&s;thma has increa&s;ed every week &s;ince you la&s;t heard from me, to the degree of confining me totally to the fire-&s;ide; &s;o that I have hardly &s;een any of my friends but two, who happen to be divided from the world as much as my|&s;elf, and are con&s;tantly retired at Batter&s;ea. There I have pa&s;t mo&s;t of my time, and often wi&s;h'd you of the company, as the be&s;t I know to make me not regret the lo&s;s of all others, and to prepare me for a nobler &s;cene than any mortal greatne&s;s can open to us. I fear by the account you gave me of the time you de&s;ign to come this way, one of them (whom I much wi&s;h you had a glymp&s;e of) will be gone again, unle&s;s you pa&s;s &s;ome weeks in London before Mr. Allen arrives there in March. My pre|&s;ent indi&s;po&s;ition takes up almo&s;t all my hours, to render a very few of them &s;upportable: yet I go on &s;oftly to prepare the great edition of my Things with your Notes, and as fa&s;t as I re|ceive any from you, I add others in order.&mdash;</P>
<P>I am told the Laureat is going to publi&s;h a very abu&s;ive pamphlet. That is all I can de&s;ire; it is enough, if it be abu&s;ive and if it be his. He threatens you; but, I think, you will not fear or love him &s;o much as to an&s;wer him, though you have an&s;wered one or two as dull. He will be more to me than a do&s;e of hart&s;|horn:
<PB N="361" REF="384">
and as a &s;tink revives one who has been oppre&s;&s;ed with perfumes, his railing will cure me of a cour&s;e of flatteries.</P>
<P>I am much more concerned to hear that &s;ome of your Clergy are offended at a ver&s;e or two of mine <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ver. 355 to 358. &s;econd book of the Dunciad.</NOTE>, becau&s;e I have a re&s;pect for <HI>your</HI> Clergy, (though the ver&s;es are harder up|on <HI>ours.)</HI> But if they do not blame <HI>you</HI> for de|fending tho&s;e ver&s;es, I will wrap my&s;elf up in the layman's cloak, and &s;leep under your &s;hield.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry to find by a letter two po&s;ts &s;ince from Mr. Allen, that he is not quite recovered yet of all remains of his indi&s;po&s;ition, nor Mrs. Allen quite well. Don't be di&s;couraged from telling me how you are: for no man is more yours than, &amp;c.</P>

<P>IF I was not a&s;hamed to be &s;o behind hand with you, that I can never pretend to fetch it up (any more than I could in my pre&s;ent &s;tate, to overtake you in a race) I would par|ticularize which of your letters I &s;hould have an&s;wered fir&s;t. It mu&s;t &s;uffice to &s;ay I have re|ceived them all; and whatever very little re|&s;pites

I have had, from the daily care of my malady, have been employed in revi&s;ing the papers <HI>on the u&s;e of Riches,</HI> which I would have ready for your la&s;t revi&s;e, again&s;t you come to town, that they may be begun with while you are here.&mdash;I own, the late encroachments upon my con&s;titution make me willing to &s;ee the end of all further care about me or my works. I would re&s;t for the one, in a full re|&s;ignation of my Being to be di&s;po&s;ed of by the Father of all mercy; and for the other (though indeed a trifle, yet a trifle may be &s;ome ex|ample) I would commit them to the candour of a &s;en&s;ible and reflecting judge, rather than to the malice of every &s;hort-&s;ighted and malevo|lent critic, or inadvertent and cen&s;orious rea|der. And no hand can &s;et them in &s;o good a light, or &s;o well turn their be&s;t &s;ide to the day as your own. This obliges me to confe&s;s I have for &s;ome months thought my&s;elf going, and that not &s;lowly, down the hill. The rather as every attempt of the phy&s;icians, and &s;till, the la&s;t medicines more forceable in their na|ture, have utterly fail'd to &s;erve me. I was at la&s;t, about &s;even days ago, taken with &s;o violent a fit at Batter&s;ea, that my friends Lord M. and Lord B. &s;ent for pre&s;ent help to the &s;urgeon; who&s;e bleeding me, I am per&s;uaded, &s;aved my life, by the in&s;tantaneous effect it had; and
<PB N="363" REF="386">
which has continued &s;o much to amend me, that I have pa&s;s'd five days without oppre&s;&s;ion, and recovered, what I have three months want|ed, &s;ome degree of expectoration, and &s;ome hours together of &s;leep. I am now got to Twitenham, to try if the air will not take &s;ome part in reviving me, if I can avoid colds; and between that place and Batter&s;ea with my Lord B. I will pa&s;s what I have of life, while he &s;tays (which I can tell you, to my great &s;atisfaction will be this fortnight or three weeks yet.) What if you came before Mr. Allen, and &s;taid till then, in&s;tead of po&s;tponing your journey long|er? Pray, if you write, ju&s;t tell him how ill I have been, or I had wrote again to him: But that I will do, the fir&s;t day I find my&s;elf alone with pen, ink, and paper, which I can hard|ly be even here, or in any &s;pirits yet to hold a pen.

<P>IN THE NAME OF GOD, AMEN. I Alexander Pope, of Twickenham, in the county of Middle&s;ex, make this my la&s;t Will and Te&s;tament. I re&s;ign my Soul to its Crea|tor in all humble hope of its future happine&s;s, as in the di&s;po&s;al of a Being infinitely good. As to my Body, my will is, that it be buried near the monument of my dear Parents at Twickenham, with the addition, after the words <HI>filius fecit</HI>&mdash;of the&s;e only, <HI>et &s;ibi: Qui obiit anno</HI> 17&mdash;<HI>aetatis</HI>&mdash;and that it be carried to the grave by &s;ix of the poore&s;t men of the pa|ri&s;h, to each of whom I order a &s;uit of grey coar&s;e cloth, as mourning. If I happen to die at any inconvenient di&s;tance, let the &s;ame be done in any other other pari&s;h, and the In&s;crip|tion be added on the monument at Twicken|ham.

<P>But all the manu&s;cript and unprinted papers which I &s;hall leave at my decea&s;e, I de&s;ire may be delivered to my noble Friend, Henry St. John, lord Bolingbroke, to who&s;e &s;ole care and judgment I commit them, either to be pre|&s;erved or de&s;troyed; or, in ca&s;e he &s;hall not &s;ur|vive me, to the above&s;aid Earl of Marchmont. The&s;e, who in the cour&s;e of my Life have done me all other good offices, will not refu&s;e me this la&s;t after my Death: I leave them there|fore this trouble, as a mark of my tru&s;t and friend&s;hip; only de&s;iring them each to accept of &s;ome &s;mall memorial of me: That my lord Bolingbroke will add to his library all the vo|lumes of my Works and Tran&s;lations of Ho|mer, bound in red morocco, and the eleven volumes of tho&s;e of Era&s;mus: That my lord Marchmont will take the large paper edition of Thuanus, by Buckley, and that portrait of Lord Bolingbroke, by Richard&s;on, which he &s;hall prefer: That my lord Bathur&s;t will find a place for the three &s;tatues of the Hercules of Furne&s;e, the Venus of Medicis, and the Apollo

<P>The little Thing which you take so kindly, is but a very small part of what I owe you; and whatever my &s;tudies, or (to use a properer $word$) Illeness, are capa|ble of producing ought to be returned you in mere Gratitude for the Pleasure I have received from your own Writings: In which give me leave to say, your good will to me in particular, is as distinguishable, as the obligation you lay on the Public in ge|neral. I am very happy in the Envy and silly Attacks of such People, as have awakened the Genero&s;ity of so powerful a Defender. Nor am I ashamed of those Weakne&s;ses of mine, which they have expo&s;ed in Print (the greatest of which was my thinking $word$ candidly of them, to whom I wrote my Letters with so much unguard|ed Friendline&s;s and Freedom), since you have found a way to $word$ those Weakne&s;ses into Virtue, by your partial regard of them. The Eye of Candour, like the Sun, makes all the Beauties which it sees; it gives colour and Brightne&s;s to the mean|est objects purely by looking on them. I agree with you, that there is a plea&s;ure in seeing the Nature and Temper of Men in the plainest undre&s;s; but few Men are of Consequence enough to deserve, or reward, that curio&s;ity. I shall indeed (and so will all Mankind) be highly pleased to see the great C$zar of Mu&s;covy in this Light, drawn by himself&punc; like an ancient Ma&s;ter, in rough &s;trokes, without heightening, or shadowing: What a satisfaction to behold that perfect likene&s;s, without art, affecta|tion, or even the Glo&s;s of Colouring, with a noble Neglect of all that finishing and smoothing, which any other Hand would have been obliged to bestow on so principal a Figure? I write this to a Man whose Judgment I am certain of, and therefore am as certain you will give the World this great Deposition, just as you have received it: There will be no danger of your dre&s;sing this Mars too finely, whose Armour is not gold, but adamant, and whose $word$ in all probability is much more &s;trong than it is poli&s;h'd. I congratulate you, that this great Treasure is fallen into your Hands; and I congratulate all Europe, that it is to be delivered to them through the Hands of one, who will think it Sacrilege to touch upon, much le&s;s to alter, any great Lines of such an Original.</P>
<P>I can make you no better return for your great Compliment upon me (which it would be Arrogance in me to &s;how to any other, and dangerous even to remember myself) but by $elling you, that it is honour enough to reward all my &s;tudies, to find my Character and reputation is part of the Care of that person, to whom the fame and

<P>I am forced to make use of another Hand than my own in this Letter, having received a Wound cross all the Veins of my right Hand, by which the Tendors of two Fingers are separated however, it was a Fine paid for my Life, which has been very narrowly saved, and which may now continue me some years longer,</P>

<P>I was unwilling to answer your too obliging Letter (which puts much too great a stre&s;s upon my opinion) till I had read your Play with the atten|tion it deserves; I mean, not once, but several times over. In a Word, to comply with my Judgment will cost you no trouble, except to your Modesty; which is, to act it as soon as po&s;sible. Nothing but Triffles have I to object, and which were such as did not once stop one at the first Reading; the Spirit, Design, and Characters, carrying me on, without Stop, Check, or $ven Intermi&s;sion. You certainly are Master of the art of the Stage, in the manner of forming and conducting the Design, which I which impo&s;sible to be mended; of that great Part, and of the other, the raising the Pa&s;sions, I will say nothing to you, who know them so much better than myself. I would only point out a few particularities in thought or expre&s;sion, as material as excepting to a Button on your Coat; or a loose Hair. Two or three Lines I have with great $imorousne&s;s written on one of your blank Leaves, in Black lead, half afraid to be legible, and not without some hope that before you see them, they may be vani&s;hed: So may perhaps my objections, every one of them. Shall I see you soon, to tell you these Nothings? whenever I shall see you, I hope to find, we can employ the time better, than I, in $elling, or you, in hearing them. Or must I return you the Play now? Your orders will be obey'd as soon as you give them.&mdash;I really rejoice at your Lady's Recovery: I would have her and you think, the air of Richmond is particularly good to re-establish her. Pray let $word$ Hill know, I am ready to believe all the good Things her own Father can see in her: I can safely trust both his Judgments, and his Affections. I am, truly,</P>

<P>I made a &s;trong E&s;say to have told you in person how very kindly I took your two last Letters. The only Flours I had in my Power from a Nece&s;sary Care that brought one back immediately, I would have imposed on you. It will please you to know the poor Woman is rather letter, tho it may be but like the Improvement of

a Light on the End of a dying Jap$n, which brightens a little before it expires.&mdash;Your Hint about my Title of False Taste, you'll see, is made use of in the Second Edition. Your opinion also of my giving some public Di&s;sent or protest against the silly malicious Misconstruction of the Town, I agree to; but I think no one step should be taken in it, but in concert with the Duke whom they injure. It will be a pleasure felt by you, to tell you, his grace has written to me the &s;trongest A&s;surance imaginable of the Rectitude of his opinion, and of his Resentment of that Report, which to Him is an Impertinence, to me a Villainy.</P>
<P>I am afraid of tiring you, and (what is your best Security) I have not time to do it. I'll only just tell you, that many Circumstances you have heard, as Resemblances to the Picture of $i$on, are utterly Inventions of Lyars; the Number of Servants never was an Hundred, the Paintings not of Venio, or La Guerre, but Bell$$ci and Laman; no such Buffet, Manner of Recep|tion at the Study, Terras, &amp;c. all which, and many more, they have not $erupled to forge, to gain &s;ome credit to the Application: And (which is worse) belyed Testimonics of Noblemen, and of my particular Friends, to condemn me. In a word, the Malice is as great as the D$$lne&s;s, of my Calumniators: The one I forgive, the other $$ity, and I despise both. Adieu; the first day I am near you I will find you out, and &s;hew you &s;omething you will like. My best good Wishes are yours, and Mi&s;s. $rania's</P>

<P>Since I am fully satisfied we are each of us sincerely and affectionately Servants to the other, I desire we may be no further mis-led by the warmth of writing on this Subject. If you think I have shown too much Weakne&s;s, or if I think you have &s;hown too much warmth, let us forgive one another's Temper. I told you I thought my Letter a &s;illy one; but the more I thought so, the more in sending it I &s;hew'd my First in your good Di&s;position toward me. I am sorry you took i$ to have an $ir of Neglect, or Superiority: Because I know in my Heart, I had not the least&punc; Thought of being any way &s;uperior to M^r. Hi$$; and, far from the least design $o &s;hew Neglect to a Gentleman who was &s;hewing me Civility, I meant in return to &s;hew him a better thing, Sincerity; which I am sorry should be so ill expre&s;s'd as to seem Rudene&s;s. I meant but to complain as frankly as you, that all complaints on both sides might be out, and at a period for ever: I meant by this to have &s;aid a surer Foundation for your opinion of me for the future, that it might no more be &s;haken by Mi&s;takes or Whi&s;pers.</P>
<P>I am sure, Sir, you have a higher Opinion of my Poetry than I my&s;elf. But I am so desirous you &s;hould have a just one of me every way, that I wish you understood both my Temper in general, and my Justice to you in particular, better than I find my Letter repre&s;ented them. I wish it the more, since you tell me how i$$ a picture my Enemies take upon 'em to give, of the Mind of a Man they are $$ter Strangers to. However, you will observe, that much Sple$$ and Emotion are a little inconsistent with Neglect; and an Opinion of Superiority. Towards them God knows, I never fell any Emotions, $$t what bad Writers raise in all Men,
<PB N="376" REF="398">
tho&s;e gentle ones of Laughter or Pity: That I was so open, concern'd and serious, with respect to you only, is sure a proof of Regard, not Neglect. For in Truth, nothing ever $$$'d me, till I saw your Epigram against D^r. S. and me, come out in the Papers: and this, indeed, did $$x me, to see One Swan among the Geese.</P>
<P>That the Letters A. H. were apply'd to you in the Papers, I did not know (for I seldom read them); I heard it only from M^r. Savage, as from yourself, and sent my A&s;surances to the Contrary. But I don't see how the Annotator on the D. could have rectify'd that Mistake, publickly, without particularizing your Name, in a Book where I thought it too good to be inserted. No doubt he has apply'd that Pa&s;sage in the D. to you, by the Story he tells; but his mention of Bom bast, on by in $ome of your $uo$ni$$e Pieces, I think, was meant to &s;hew, that pa&s;sage hinted only at that Allegori|cal $$$ddine&s;s&punc; and not any worse sort of Di$t, with which some other Writers were charg'd. I hale to say what will not be believed: Yet when I told you, "many ask'd me to whom that oblique praise was meant?" I did not tell you I answerd, it was you. Has it escap'd your observation, that the name is a Syllable too long? Or (if you will have it a Christian Name) is there any other in the whole Book? Is there no author of two Syllables whom it will better fit, not only as getting out of the Allegorical Muddine&s;s, but as having been dipt in the Dirt of Party-Writing, and recovering from it betimes? I know such a Man, who would take it for a Compliment, and so would his Patrons too&mdash;But I ask you not to believe this, except you are vastly incli$'d to it. I will come closer to the Point: Would you have the note left out? It &s;hall. Would you have it expre&s;sly vaid, you were not meant? It &s;hall, if I have any Influence on the Editors.</P>
<P>I believe the Note was meant only as a gentle Rebuke, and friendlily: I understood very well the $$$eat on your part to be the same; and complain'd (you see) of nothing but two or three Lines reflecting on my Behaviour and Temper to other Writers; because I know they were not true, and you cou'd not know they were.</P>
<P>You can not in your cool Judgment think it fair to fix a Man's Character on a point, of which you do not give one Instance? Name but the Man, or Men, to whom I have unjustly omitted approbation or Encouragement, and I'll be ready to do them justice. I think I have publickly prais'd all the best Writers of my Time, except yourself, and such as I have had no fair opportunity to praise. As $o the Great and Popular, I've prais'd but few, and those at the Times when they were least popular. Many of those writers have done nothing else but flatter'd the great and popular, or been worse employ'd by 'em in Party-&s;tuff. I do indeed think it no great Pride in me, to speak about them with some air of Superiority; and this, Sir, must be the Cause (and no other) that made me addre&s;s that&punc;declaration of my Temper towards them, to you, who had accus'd one of the Contrary; not, I a&s;sure you, from the least Imagination of any Resemblance between you and them, either in Merit or Circumstances.</P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="399" MS="Y">
I nam'd M^r. Dennis, because you distinguish him from the rest: So do I. But, moreever, he was uppermost in my Thoughts, from having endeavour'd (before your admonition) to promote his Affair, with Lord Wilmington, Lord Sa$sdown, Lord Blandford, and M^r. Pullency, $word$ who promised one to favour it. But it would be unjust to measure my Good-will by the Effects of it on the Great, many of whom are the last Men in the World who will pay tributes of this so$$, from their own ungiving Nature; and many of whom laugh at me when I seriously petition for M^r. Dennis. After this, I must not name the many whom I have fruitle&s;sly solli$ited: I hope yet to be more succe&s;sful. But, Sir, you seem too iniquitous in your Conceptions of me, when you fancy I call'd such Things Services. I call'd 'em but humane Offices: Services I said I would render him, if I could. I would ask a place for life for him; and I have; but that is not in my Power: If it was, it would be a Service, and I wish it. I mentioned the Po&s;sibility of M^r. D. 's abusing me for forgiving him, because he actually did, in Print, lately represent my Poor, undesigning, Sub&s;criptions to him, to be the Effect of Fear and Desire; to stop his Critiques upon me. I wish M^r. Hill would (for once) think so can didly of me, as to believe me Sincere in one Declaration, that "I desire no Man to bel$e his own Judgment in my Favour." Therefore, the I acknowledge your generous Offer to give Examples of Imperfections rather out of your own Works than mine, in your intended Book; I consent, with all any Heart, to your con$ining them to mine; for two Reasons: The one, that I fear your Sensibility that way is greater than any own (by observing you seem too concern'd at that Hint given by the Notes on the D. of a little Fault in the Works of your Youth only): The other is a better, namely, that I intend to amend by your Remarks, and correct the Faults you find, if they are such as I expect from M^r. Hill's cool Judgment.</P>
<P>I am very sensible, that any Poetical Talent is all that may (I say not, will) make me remembered: But it is my Morality only that must make me Beloved, or Happy: And if it be any Deviation from Greatne&s;s of Mind&punc; to prefer Friendships to Fame, or the honest Enjoyments of Life to noisy Praises; I fairly confe&s;s that Meanne&s;s. Therefore it is, for, that I much more resent any attempt against my moral Character (which I know to be unjust) than any to le&s;sen my poetical one (which for all I know, may be very just).</P>
<P>Pray then, Sir, excuse my weak Letter, as I do your warm one. I end as I begun. You gue&s;s'd right, that I was sick when I wrote it: Yours are very well written, but I have neither Health nor time to make mine so. I have writ a whole Book of Retractations of my Writings (which would greatly improve your Criticisms on any Errors), but of my Life and manners I do not yet repent one jot, especially when I find in my Heart I continue to be, without the least $$rimony (even as little as I desire you should bear to myself),</P>

<P>Ever since I $word$ return'd Home, I have been in almost $varing Pain, with a violent Rheumatism in my Shoulder, so that all I am able to do is to return you thanks for yours. The Satisfaction it gave me is proportion'd to the Regard I have for you. I will not praise your Poem further than to say, the Generosity of its Sentiments must charm every Man: Its other Merit you know well. You'll pardon the few doubts I start in the Interlinings; they are such as you can effa$e as easily as they may de|&s;erve.

<P>I am extremely pleas'd with the favour you have done me in &s;ending me your Poem, and the more, as it gives me the Opportunity of a&s;suring You, I never did, or meant you, the least injury; in which I should have fully satisfied you long since, had you ask'd me the Question. I remember, M^r.

This was all, to the best of my Memory, that pa&s;s'd between us; and you may imagine it was some Surprize to me when I saw your Preface a very &s;hort time after. I think it incumbent on any well-meaning Man, to acquit himself of an illgrounded Suspicion in another, who perhaps means equally well, and is only too $edulous. I am &s;incerely so far from resenting this Mistake, that I am more displeas'd, at your thinking it nece&s;sary to treat me so much in a Style of Compliment as you do in your Letter.

<P>It is a &s;erious Pleasure to me to find you concern'd, that I should do your good Sense and Discernment the Justice it deserves. It is impo&s;sible for me not to think just what you would have me on this Head; the whole Spirit and meaning of your Poem &s;hews all little thoughts to be &s;trangers to your Soul. I happen to know many Particulars relating to the Earl of Peterborough's con|duct, and just Glory, in that Scene you draw so well: But no Man ought (I think) to attempt what you hint at, or can pretend to do him more Ho|nour than what you yourself here have done, except himself: I have long pre&s;$'d him to put together many Papers lying by him, to that End. On this late Occasion he told me you had formerly endeavoured the same, and it comes into my Mind, that, on many of those Papers, I've &s;een an Endorsement A.

My Lord &s;poke of you with great Regard, and told me how narrowly you both mi&s;s'd of going toge|ther on an Adventurous Expedition <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On an Expedition to the West Indies.</NOTE>.

<P>I could not persuade myself to write to you since your great Le&s;s, till I hoped you had received some alleviation to it, from the only Hand which can give any, that of time. Not to have mention'd it, however fashion able it may be, I think unnatural, and in some Sense inhuman; and I fear the Contrary Custom is too much an Excuse, in reality, for that Indifference we usually have for the Con|cern of another: In truth, that was not my Case: I know the Reason of one Man is of little Effect toward the Resignation of another; and when I compar'd the Forces of yours and mine, I doubted not which had the advantage, even tho in your own Concern. 'Tis hard, that in these tender Afflictions the greatne&s;s of the Mind and the Goodne&s;s are opposite to each other; and that while Reason, and the Consideration upon what Conditions we receive all the Goods of this Life, operate towards our Quiet; over the best of our Pa&s;sions (which are the same things with the softest of our Virtues) refuse us that Comfort. But I'll say no more on this Melancholy Subject. The whole Intent of this Letter is to tell you how much I wish you capable of Consolation, and how much I wish to know when you find yourself so. I would hope you begin to &s;ee$ it, to amuse your Mind with those Studies of which Jully says, Adversis perfugium &amp; &s;olatium pr$$ent, and to transcribe (if I may so expre&s;s it) your own Softne&s;ses and and generous Pa&s;sions into the Hearts of others who more want them.

I desire your first Notice, if you come this way; or, rather, I wish you would take up your Lodging with me. In the mean time, pray send the Tragedy of Athelwo$d (for so I would call it), under Cover, to the Counte&s;s of Suffolk, before Monday, at her Lodgings in S^t. James's. I promis'd it her again; and if you think it of any Consequence that the K. &s;hould see it in Manu&s;cript, I think nothing more easy. In truth, all this is doing it no Credit; 'tis only doing some to those who may commend it.

<P>I thank you for your Tragedy, which I have now read over a Sixth Time; and of which I not only preserve, but increa&s;e, my Esteem. You have been kind to this age, in not telling the next, in your Preface, the ill Taste of the Town, of which the Reception you describe it to have given of your Play (worse, indeed, than I had heard, or could have imagin'd), is a more flagrant Instance than any of those Triff$es mention'd in my Epi&s;tle; which yet, I hear, the sore $anity of our Pretenders to Taste flinches at extremely&mdash;The Title you mention had been a properer to that Epistle&ndash;I have heard no Criticisms about it; nor do I listen after them; Nos haec $$$imus e$se $ihi$ (I mean, I think the Verses to be so): But as you are a Man of tnder Sentiments of Honour, I know it will gziev$ you to hear another, undeservedly chang'd with a Crime his Heart is free from: For, if there be Truth in the World, I declare to you, I never imagin'd the least Application of what I said of Jimon could be made to the D. of $h&mdash;s, than whom there is &s;carce a more Hamele&s;s, worthy, and Ge|nerous, beneficent Character, among all our Nobility: And if I have not lost my Senses, the Town has lost 'em, by what I heard so &s;ate, as but two Days ago, of the uproar on this Head. I am certain, if you calmly read every particular of that De&s;crip|tion, you'll find almost all of 'em point blank the Reverse of that Person's Villa. It's an a$kward thing for a Man to print, in Defence of his own Work, against a Chim$era: You know not who, or what, you fight against: The objections start up in a n$w Shape, like the Armies and Phantoms of Magicians, and no Weapon can $$d a Mist, or a Shadow. Yet it would have been a Pleasure to me, to have found some Friend saying a Word in my Justification, against a most malicious Fa$shood. I &s;peak of such, as have known by their own Experience, those Twenty Years, that I always took up their Defence, when any &s;tream of Calumny ran upon 'em&punc; If it gives the Duke one Moment's uneasine&s;s, I &s;hould think myself ill paid, if the whole. Earth admir'd the Poetry; and believe me, would rather never have written a Verse in my Life, than any one of 'em &s;hould trouble a truly good Man. It was once my Case before, but happily reconcil'd; and among generous Minds nothing so endears Friends, as the having offended one another.</P>
<P>I lament the Malice of the age, that Studies to see its own likene&s;s it every thing; I lament the Dulne&s;s of it, that cannot see an Excellence: The first is my an hap|pine&s;s, the second yours. I look upon the Fate of your Piece, like that of a great Trea|&s;ure, which is bury'd as soon as brought to light; but it is sure to be dug up the next age, and enrich Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>I have been very sensible, on these two occasions, to feel them (as I have done) at a Time, when I daily fear'd the Lo&s;s of (what is, and ought to be dearer to one than any Reputation, but that of a Friend, or than any thing of my own, except my $$rals) the Lo&s;s of a most tender Parent&mdash;She is alive&punc; and that is all!

It is true, I have &s;hewn a scorn of some Writers; but it proceeded from an Experience that they were bad Men, or bad Friends, or vile $inelings; in which Case, their being Authors did not make them, to me, either more respectable, or more formidable.

<P>I thank you for the Confidence you &s;hew you have in me, in &s;elling me what you judge a$i&s;s in my Nature.

I am sorry yours was attended with any Thoughts le&s;s pleasing, either from the Conduct towards you of the World in general, or of any one else in particular. As to the Subject matter of the Letter, I found what I have often done in receiving Letters from those I most esteem'd and most wished to be esteem'd by; a great pleasure in reading it, and a great inability to answer it, I can only say, you oblige me, in seeming so well to know me again; as one extremely willing that the free Exercise of Criticism should extend over my own Writings, as well as those of others, whenever the Public may receive the least Benefit from it; as I question not they will a great deal, when exerted by you.

<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have now little to say of your Tragedy, which I return with my Thanks for your Indulgence to my Opinion, which $word$ $o a$$$lutely de&s;er'd to, that I wish I had $ro&s;o'd le&s;s, frequently. I cannot, find another thing I think a fault in you. But my $ord thinks, three things may yet reconsider'd. Brutus, $n Sight of the $arran$ &s;ign'd for his Death, takes at once the Resolution of murdering Ce|sar, as none of his Father. Que$e, Whether in the $$ene that follows between him and Cesar, all $$nderne&s;s on the &s;ide of Brutus, and all beyond the point of Honour that Friend&s;hip exacted, &s;hould not rather be avoided than heigh|$$ned?</P>
<P>Another Quere is, Whether it would not bege$ more Indignation in the Au|dience against Ca&s;sius and more Compa&s;sion, for Cesar, to $he$ that Ca&s;sius suspected Brutus to be Cesars Sen, and therefore $$acted from Brutus the $ath of $$aring neither Father, Relation, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The third thing is, Whether the Efforts made by Cesar to pre$ent the Civil War, not only by the equall Offer he made, while the matter was under Deba$$ in the &s;enate (and which the Consuls Lentulus and Marcellus refused to report to the Senate), but by the Me&s;sage he sent to Pempcy, when he was at Branda&s;ion, to desire a Meeting, to settle the Matter, and avoid the Civil War.&mdash;$id. $word$ $on$m. d$. bell. Civili, lib. I. The mention of these &s;omewhere in the Hay might help to $word$ the Prepo&s;se&s;sion against Cesar.</P>
<P>After our little Cavils (for so we will rather call $word$ and verbal Points of Cri+&s;icism) we owe you the Justice to $word$ highly, what we highly approve, and you need not desire us to &s;peak as we think: 'Tis what we have (in different Ways) done all our Lives, where it was to our prejudice, and cannot but do here, where it is to our Honour. I only wish you a Stage, Actors, and an Audi|ence worthy of you, and it.&mdash;I have often wished to live to see the Day when Prologues and Epilogues &s;hould be no more. I wish a great Genius would break thro' the $illy, usele&s;s, Formality. But at least I would have one try, to leave the Audience full of the Effects of a good Tragedy, without an Epilogue. $et
<PB N="390" REF="412" MS="Y">
me add another Hint, concerning the apparatus and Circumstantials of your Play (since I have nothing left more to wish in the Play itself); that you would intitle i$ barely. The Tragedy of Cesar, and give no Intimation of his being a Patrie$; for I fear, instead of preparing the Audience, it might revolt them, and put all the little Criticks upon carping previously $word$ the very design and Cha|racter; which would appear by and with the proper Preparations, in the Piece on the Stage. Another thing was a Thought of my Lord's, that i$ &s;hould be printed before Acting, a day or two; for the Sentiments are so thick $own, and the Sense so deep sometimes, that they require more attention and Thought than the Hearer may be apt to give on the first Representation. I am not positive&punc; either as to this, or my Thought, but &s;ubmit them to your Consideration.</P>
<P>I have nothing to add, but to lament $ur unhappine&s;s, that we cannot see you personally to conform what these Letters tell you, of our real Opinion of your Work, Esteem of its Author, and wishes for your Succe&s;s, in this, and every thing.</P>

<P>This is quite a Letter of Busine&s;s, and therefore excuse it, I will not mix in i$ a Word of Affection, which I have not a Moment's time to expre&s;s, and will not prejudice the sacred Idea of Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>It is near a Month age that I try'd to see W. Thom&s;on, to know the Time of his Tragedy: He was not within my Reach; and therefore at last I wrote to him, and also to W. M&mdash;, to let them both know the Deference you paid them, and the Her$i$ (I will not call it le&s;s) Disinterestedne&s;s you expre&s;s'd in regard to them I have not $word$ been able to $word$ where they are, $r any way to have an $word$ further, than I have learn'd it will be imp$&s;sible, for either of them to bring $word$ their $word$ early (a Friend of $he$$$ $$lling m$ they are in no forwardn$$$) $ill th$ Middle $word$ of $in$$r; therefore you m$y have r$$m.

I would to God you had any Op|pertunity of seeing as&mdash;before $e parts my House &s;hould be yours, as much of i$ $$is not his.

<P>I have been confirmed by M^r. Thom&s;on as to the R$tardment of his Play, of which he has written but Two $e$s. I have &s;ince seen M^r. M&mdash;, who has finished his, but is very willing yours &s;hould be first brought on, in January as you prepose; or after his in February, whichsoever be most agreeable to you. He farther offers any A&s;sistance he can give you, in Case&punc; of your own Absence, as to $reating with M^r. F&mdash;(with whom t$e thinks you cannot be too careful or explicit), or attending the Rehearsals for you, which he promises to undertake with all Diligence, if you are not provided with another Friend in that Case. He has heard of some Impertinence which may be apprehended from one Persons Refusal or Unwillingne&s;s to act; and $eli$ve$ he can employ some proper Influence to bring him to a right Behaviour. These, with any other &s;ervices in which you may please &s;o employ him, he bids me a&s;sure you, it will be a high &s;atisfaction to him to engage in.</P>
<P>I must expre&s;s, on my own Part, a $word$ Regret to be so little $word$ to you. I can do no more than join with Lord B. in paying due Praises to $o me|ritorious a Herk; our Suffrage is an $i$y Trib$$e, from whence no &s;olid good $ed$$$nds to you; and I find myself still more inclined to the Man, than the Author, if I could be any way in&s;trumental to the Happine&s;s or Case of so generous an one. I could almost with myself a Minister to patro|nize with a Genius, and I could almost with my Lord one again, for in other Reason; even tho' his Country wants &s;uch an one, as well as his Friends.</P>
<P>I have never once been able to M^r. Thom&s;on in Person; when $word$ $end it &s;hall be soon) he &s;hall know how much he is obliged to you for that Plan of an Alteration of his Tragedy, which is for good for me, with any Honesty, to put upon him as my own.

<P>I have felt an uneasing's of Mind (occasioned by a conscious &s;ense, here unequally I have expre&s;s'd any Anger and Contempt, at the Treatment of your $$$ar by the Man of the &s;tage) ever since I fast wrote to you; and a Hundred Interruptions from Day to Day ($$r I have lived in the World, and a $word$ and idle World both, it is) have ever since hindered me from enjoying one Hour of collected Thought. Yet I am the le&s;s concern'd, since&punc; by my delay, I can now tell you I have last Night &s;een M^r. Mallet's Play, the fifth Act of which I had not before read, thro' those Interruptions I have men|tion'd. It &s;ucceeded (hitherto at least; for Yesterday was the first Day) as
<PB N="392" REF="414">
well as I could expect; But so $il$ly acted in the Womens Parts and Mens (except two) that I wonder it could succeed. M^r. Thom&s;on, after many &s;hame|ful Tricks from the Manage$, is determin'd to act his Play at the other Theatre, where the Advantage lies as to the Women, and the &s;ucce&s;s of his will depend upon them (I heartify wish you would follow his Example, that we might not be deprived of Cesar). I have yet &s;een but three. Acts of M^r. Thom&s;on's, but I am told, and believe by what I have &s;een, that it exce&s;s in the Pathetic. The Dignity of Sentiment, and Grandeur of Character, will still be Cesar's, as in his History, so in your Poetry, superior to any.</P>
<P>The Person to whom you intended so great a Compliment as to addre&s;s that Piece to his Name, is very sensible of your delicate manner of thinking. He bids me a&s;sure you, his own Knowledge of your Intention is sufficient pleasure to him, and desires you would not think of doing him either Favour or Justice; till the World knows better how to do itself the former, in doing you the latter. He is still detain'd here by the powersne&s;s of his Affairs; and wishes, as I most heartify do also, that fortune did not treat you so much alike. The &s;tage is as ungrateful to you, as his Country to him: You are both sure of Posterity, and $$ay $ay in the mean time with &s;cipio, Ingrata Patria, ne o$$a quidem habeas.

<P>I am obliged to you for your Compliment, and can truly say, I never gave you just Cause of Complaint. You once misteck on a Booksellers Idle Report, and publickly expre&s;s'd your Mistake; yet you mistech a Second time; that two initial Letters, only, were meant of you, tho every Letter in the Alphabet was put in the same manner; and, in Truth (except some few), those Letters were set at Random to occasion what they did Occasion, the Suspicion of bad and jealous Writers, of which Number I could never $$$ho$ M^r. Hill. and most of whose Names I did not know.</P>
<P>Upon this Mistake you were too ready to attach me, in a paper of very pretty Verses, in some publick Journal.&mdash;I &s;hould imagine the Dunciad meant you a real Compliment, and so it has been thought by many, who have ask'd, to whom that Pa&s;sage made that oblique Panegyrich? As to the Notes I am weary of telling a great Truth, which is, that I am not Author of 'em; tho I love Truth so well, as fairly to tell you, Sir, I think even that Note a Commendation, and &s;hould think myself not ill us'd to have the same Words said of me: Therefore, believe me, I never was other than Friendly to you, in my own Mind.</P>
<P>Have I not much more Reason to complain of the Cavea$? Where give me Leave,
<PB N="393" REF="415">
Sir, to tell you, with the same Love of Truth, and with the Frankne&s;s is inspir'd (which, I hope, you will see, thro this whole Letter), I am $al$ly abus'd, in being represented "Sneakingly to approve, and want the Worth to cherish, or be friend Men of Merit." It is, indeed, Sir, a very great Error: I am sorry the Author of that Reflection knew me no better, and happen'd to be unknown to those who could have better inform'd him: For I have the Charity to think, he was misted only by his Ignorance of me, and the Be|nevolence to Forgive the worst thing that ever (in my Opinion) was said of me, on that Supposition.</P>
<P>I do faithfully a&s;sure you, I never was angry at any Criticism made on my Poetry, by whomsoever: If I could do W. Dennis any humane office I would, tho' I were sure he would abuse me personally To-morrow; therefore it is no great Merit in me to find, at my Heart, I am your Servant. I am very sorry you ever was of another Opinion.&mdash;I see, by many Marks, you distin|guish'd me from $word$ $$temporary Writers: Had we known one another, you had distinguish'd me from others, as a Man, and no ill, or ill-natured one. I only wish you knew, as well as I do, how much I prefer Qualities of the Heart to those of the Head: I $ow to God, I never thought any great Matters of my Poetical Capacity; I only thought it a little better, comparatively, than that of some very mean Writers, who are too proud.&mdash;But, I do know cer|tainly, my moral Life is superier to that of most of the Wits of these Days. This is a silly Letter, but it will Shew you my Mind honestly, and, I hope, convince you, I can be, and am,</P>
