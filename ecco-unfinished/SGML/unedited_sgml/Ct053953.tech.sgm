<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Reader can de&s;ire no better Recommendation
of the Hi&s;tory now publi&s;hed, than to be a&s;&s;ured
that it is the genuine Work of the Great Earl of
<HI>Clarendon.</HI> The Work it &s;elf bears plain Cha|racteri&s;ticks
of its Author. The &s;ame Dignity of
Sentiment, and Style, which di&s;tingui&s;hes <HI>THE
HISTORY OF THE REBELLION,</HI> and all
other the Works of this noble Writer, breathes
through the whole of this Performance.</P>
<P>THE Rea&s;on, why this Hi&s;tory has lain &s;o long concealed, will ap|pear
from the<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Continuation, Page 1.</NOTE> Title of it, which &s;hews that his Lord&s;hip intended it <HI>only for
the Information of his Children.</HI> But the late Lord <HI>Hyde,</HI> judging that
&s;o faithful and authentick an Account of this intere&s;ting Period of our
Hi&s;tory would be an u&s;eful and acceptable Pre&s;ent to the Publick, and bear|ing
a grateful Remembrance of this Place of his Education, left by his Will
this, and the other Remains of his Great Grandfather, in the Hands of
Tru&s;tees, to be printed at our Pre&s;s, and directed <HI>that the Profits ari&s;ing
from the Sale &s;hould be employed towards the e&s;tabli&s;hing a Riding-School
in the Univer&s;ity.</HI> But Lord <HI>Hyde</HI> dying before his Father, the then
Earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> the Property of the&s;e Papers never became ve&s;ted in him,
and con&s;equently this Beque&s;t was void. However, the noble Heire&s;&s;es of the
Earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> out of their Regard to the Publick, and to this Seat of
Learning, have been plea&s;ed to fulfill the kind Intentions of Lord <HI>Hyde,</HI>
and adopt a Scheme recommended both by him,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See his Dialogue on Education, P. 325, &amp;c.</NOTE> and his Great Grand|father.
<PB N="II" REF="5">
To this End They have &s;ent to the Univer&s;ity this Hi&s;tory, to be
printed at our Pre&s;s, on Condition <HI>that the Profits ari&s;ing from the Publi|cation
or Sale of this Work be applied, as a Beginning for a Fund for
&s;upporting a Manage, or Academy for Riding, and other u&s;eful Exer|ci&s;es,
in</HI> Oxford.</P>
<P>THE Work here offered to the Publick con&s;i&s;ts of two Parts. The Second,
which is the mo&s;t important and intere&s;ting Part of the Work, is <HI>THE
HISTORY OF THE EARL OF CLARENDON'S LIFE FROM THE YEAR 1660
TO</HI> 1667, from the Re&s;toration to the Time of his Bani&s;hment, and in|cludes
in it the mo&s;t memorable Tran&s;actions of tho&s;e Times. It may be
therefore con&s;idered in two Views. It is a Second Part of <HI>LORD CLARENDON'S
LIFE:</HI> and is al&s;o a Continuation of his former Hi&s;tory, entitled
<HI>THE HISTORY OF THE REBELLION,</HI> from the Year 1660, where that ends,
to the Year 1667. This is carefully printed, without any material Varia|tions,
from a Manu&s;cript all of Lord <HI>Clarendon's</HI> own Hand-writing, ex|cepting
&s;ome few Pages in the Hand of his Amanuen&s;is, which are only
Tran&s;cripts from two Papers, the one, <HI>a Letter from the Chancellor to the
King on the Subject of his Maje&s;ty's declared Di&s;plea&s;ure;</HI> the other, <HI>a
Paper containing his Rea&s;ons for withdrawing him&s;elf,</HI> which He left be|hind
him to be pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e of Peers.</P>
<P>TO this our noble Benefactre&s;&s;es have thought fit to prefix, as a Fir&s;t
Part, <HI>THE HISTORY OF THE EARL OF CLARENDON'S LIFE, FROM HIS
BIRTH, TO THE YEAR</HI> 1660, extracted from another Manu&s;cript of Lord
<HI>Clarendon's</HI> own Hand-writing. This other Manu&s;cript is entitled by his
Lord&s;hip, <HI>THE HISTORY OF HIS OWN LIFE,</HI> and contains likewi&s;e the Sub|&s;tance
of <HI>THE HISTORY OF THE REBELLION.</HI> However, it is not the Ma|nu&s;cript
from whence that Hi&s;tory was printed, but appears rather to be
the rough Draught, from whence that Hi&s;tory, or however great Part of it,
was afterwards compiled. For although He tells us towards the Clo&s;e of this
Work, that He wrote the fir&s;t four Books of <HI>THE HISTORY OF THE REBEL|LION
in the I&s;land of</HI> Jer&s;ey, (many Years before the Date of this <HI>HISTORY
OF HIS LIFE)</HI> yet He likewi&s;e informs us, that He did not proceed to com|pleat
that Hi&s;tory till after his Bani&s;hment. It is therefore &s;uppo&s;ed by the
Family (and the Suppo&s;ition &s;eems to carry with it great Probability) that,
&s;eeing an unju&s;t and cruel Per&s;ecution prevail again&s;t him, He was induced
at that Time to extend the original Plan of his Work, by introducing the
particular Hi&s;tory of his own Life, from his earlie&s;t Days down to the Time
of his Di&s;grace, as the mo&s;t effectual Means of vindicating his Character,
wickedly traduced by his Enemies, and artfully mi&s;repre&s;ented to a Ma&s;ter,
whom he had long and faithfully &s;erved, who&s;e Countenance and Favour be|ing
transferred to the Authors and Abettors of his Ruin, might probably in the
Eyes of the World, give too much Colour to their A&s;per&s;ions. But afterwards,
on more mature Thoughts, his great Benevolence, and publick Spirit, pre|vailed
on him to drop the Defence of his own private Character, and re&s;ume
his original Plan of <HI>THE HISTORY OF THE REBELLION.</HI> However his noble
De&s;cendants, willing to do Ju&s;tice to the Memory of their Great Grandfather,
and thinking it might be al&s;o of Service to the Publick to deliver his Exemplary
Life as compleat, as They could authentically collect it, have cau&s;ed &s;uch
Parts of this Manu&s;cript, as related to the Earl of <HI>Clarendon's</HI> private
Life, to be extracted, and according to their Directions it is printed.</P>
<DIV2>
<PB N="iii" REF="6">
<HEAD>The Directions are as follows.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;THE LIFE OF LORD CHANCELLOR CLARENDON FROM HIS BIRTH TO
THE RESTORATION OF THE ROYAL FAMILY, is extracted from a large
Manu&s;cript in his own Hand-writing, in which is contained what has al|ready
been printed in THE HISTORY OF THE REBELLION; and there|fore
Care has been taken to tran&s;cribe only what has never yet been
publi&s;hed: But as tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages are often intermixed with the Hi&s;tory
already printed, it has been found nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve Connection, by
giving<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages are indented. Tho&s;e printed in <HI>Italicks,</HI> Pages 59, 82, 90, 135, the Note Page 100, and &s;ome others
&s;till le&s;s material, were added with the &s;ame View.</NOTE> Ab&s;tracts of &s;ome Parts of the printed Hi&s;tory, with References
to the Pages, where the Reader may be &s;atisfied more at large. And,
as great Pains have been taken to put this Fir&s;t Part in the Order it now
&s;tands, it is de&s;ired that in this fir&s;t Edition it may be printed exactly
after the Copy to be &s;ent.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;THE original Manu&s;cript of THE CONTINUATION OF LORD CHAN|CELLOR
CLARENDON'S LIFE FROM 1660 TO 1667 INCLUSIVE is very in|correct,
many Words being omitted, that mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;upplied:
But it is de&s;ired that no other Alterations may be made, except in the
Orthography, or where literal, or grammatical Errors require it, or
where little Inaccuracies may have e&s;caped the Attention of the Author.
The Work mu&s;t be printed entire, as it now &s;tands, no Part of it left
out, not an Ab&s;tract, nor a Reference omitted.&endq;</P>
<P><HI>THESE Directions have been punctually ob&s;erved. The Second Part is
printed from his Lord&s;hip's Manu&s;cript entire, without any Omi&s;&s;ion, or Va|riation,
except as above. And with Regard to the Fir&s;t Part, the Extract
&s;ent to us has been carefully compared with the Original Manu&s;cript it &s;elf,
and found to agree: So that the Whole here offered to the Publick is the ge|nuine
Work of the Lord Chancellor</HI> CLARENDON. <HI>And both the&s;e Valuable
Original Manu&s;cripts are given to the Univer&s;ity by our noble Benefactre&s;&s;es,
to be depo&s;ited in the Publick Library.</HI></P>

had yet no Mind to the Practice of the Law, but had long had an Inclination
to travel beyond the Seas, which in that &s;trict Time of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI>
was not u&s;ual, except to Merchants, and &s;uch Gentlemen who re&s;olved to
be Soldiers; and at la&s;t prevailed with his Mother to give him Leave to go to
the <HI>Spa</HI> for his Health, from whence He followed his former Inclinations,
and pa&s;&s;ing through <HI>Germany,</HI> He went into <HI>Italy,</HI> and from <HI>Florence</HI> He
went to <HI>Syena,</HI> and thence to <HI>Rome:</HI> Which was not only &s;trictly inhibited
to all the Queen's Subjects, but was very dangerous to all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation
who did not profe&s;s them&s;elves <HI>Roman Catholicks;</HI> to which Profe&s;&s;ion He<MILESTONE N="50">
was very aver&s;e, in Regard of the great Animo&s;ity <HI>Sixtus Quintus</HI> (who was
then Pope) had to the Per&s;on of Queen <HI>Elizabeth:</HI> Yet Cardinal <HI>Allen,</HI>
who was the la&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cardinal, being then in <HI>Rome,</HI> He received &s;o
<PB N="3" REF="10">
much Protection from him, that during the Time He &s;taid there, which
was &s;ome Months, He received no Trouble, though many <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prie&s;ts
murmured very much, and &s;aid, &startq;that my Lord Cardinal was much to
be blamed for protecting &s;uch Men, who came to <HI>Rome,</HI> and &s;o &s;eeing
the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Per&s;ons of that Nation, di&s;covered them afterwards when
They came into <HI>England,</HI> and &s;o They were put to Death.&endq;</P>
<P>AFTER He was returned into <HI>England</HI> his Mother was very glad, and
per&s;uaded him very earne&s;tly to marry, offering him in that Ca&s;e, that
whereas She had the Rectory of <HI>Dinton</HI> in Jointure for her Life, upon
<MILESTONE N="10">which He had only an Annuity of forty Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> for his Life,
the Remainder being to come to <HI>Laurence</HI> the &s;econd Brother and his
Heirs for ever, She would immediately re&s;ign her Term to him, for his
better Support, and would likewi&s;e purcha&s;e of <HI>Laurence,</HI> the &s;aid Rectory
for the Life of <HI>Henry,</HI> and &s;uch a Wife as He &s;hould marry; upon which
Encouragement, and depending &s;till upon his Mother's future Bounty,
about the thirtieth Year of his Age, He married <HI>Mary,</HI> one of the
Daughters and Heirs of <HI>Edward Langford</HI> of <HI>Trowbridge</HI> in the County of
<HI>Wilts,</HI> E&s;&abque; by whom in pre&s;ent, and after her Mother, He had a good
Fortune, in the Account of that Age. From that Time, He lived a
<MILESTONE N="20">private Life at <HI>Dinton</HI> afore&s;aid, with great Chearfulne&s;s and Content, and
with a general Reputation throughout the whole Country; being a Per&s;on of
great Knowledge and Reputation, and of &s;o great E&s;teem for Integrity, that
mo&s;t Per&s;ons near him referred all Matters of Contention and Difference
which did ari&s;e among&s;t them, to his Determination; by which, that Part
of the Country lived in more Peace and Quietne&s;s than many of their
Neighbours. During the Time of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> He &s;erved as a Burge&s;s
for &s;ome neighbour Boroughs in many Parliaments; but from the Death of
Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> He never was in <HI>London,</HI> though He lived above thirty
Years after; and his Wife, who was married to him above forty Years,
<MILESTONE N="30">never was in <HI>London</HI> in her Life; the Wi&s;dom and Frugality of that Time
being &s;uch, that few Gentlemen made Journies to <HI>London,</HI> or any other
expen&s;ive Journies, but upon important Bu&s;ine&s;s, and their Wives never;
by which Providence, They enjoyed and improved their E&s;tates in the
Country, and kept good Ho&s;pitality in their Hou&s;es, brought up their
Children well, and were beloved by their Neighbours; and in this Rank,
and with this Reputation this Gentleman lived till He was &s;eventy Years
of Age; his younger Brother the Chief Ju&s;tice dying &s;ome Years before
him, and his two elder Brothers outliving him: The great Affection between
the four Brothers, and towards their Si&s;ters, of whom all, enjoyed Plenty
<MILESTONE N="40">and Contentedne&s;s, was very notorious throughout the Country, and of
Credit to them all.</P>
<P>HENRY HYDE, the third Son of <HI>Laurence,</HI> by his Intermarriage with
<HI>Mary Langford,</HI> had four Sons and five Daughters, and being by the
Kindne&s;s and Bounty of his Mother, who lived long, and till He had
&s;even or eight Children, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch an E&s;tate as made his Condition
ea&s;y to him, lived &s;till in the Country, as was &s;aid before. <HI>Laurence</HI> his

then left it, rather with the Opinion of a young Man of Parts and Pregnancy

of that Time being not &s;o &s;trict as it hath been &s;ince, and as it ought to be;
and the Cu&s;tom of Drinking being too much introduced and practi&s;ed,
his elder Brother having been too much corrupted in that Kind, and &s;o

his Friends much feared a Con&s;umption, &s;o that his Uncle thought fit

<MILESTONE N="20">the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the I&s;le of <HI>Ree</HI> &s;hortly followed; and He had gotten into

<P>IN the Year 1628 his Father gave him Leave to ride the Circuit in the

THE Mention of this particular little Story, in it&s;elf of no &s;eeming

upon the whole Court, by dividing the Lords and Ladies, both
in their Wi&s;hes and Appearances, that much of that Faction grew out of
it, which &s;urvived the Memory of the Original; and from this Occa&s;ion
(to &s;hew us from how &s;mall Springs great Rivers may ari&s;e) the Women,<MILESTONE N="10">

&s;ome Part in all Bu&s;ine&s;s; and having &s;hewh them&s;elves warm upon this

into new Affections, and formed new Intere&s;ts; the Activity in their Spi|rits
remained &s;till vigorous when the Object which fir&s;t in&s;pired it was va|ni&s;hed

upon this Occa&s;ion; They who for their own Sakes, or, as They pre|tended,
for the King's Dignity, and Honour of the Court, de&s;ired the

&s;o great a Scandal upon the King's Family, which would hinder Per|&s;ons<MILESTONE N="20">
of Honour from &s;ending their Children to the Court; and that there
could be no Reparation without the Marriage, which They therefore only
in&s;i&s;ted upon, becau&s;e They believed He would prefer Bani&s;hment before
it; others who had Friend&s;hip for him and believed that He had an In|tere&s;t
in the Court, which might accommodate him&s;elf and them if this
Breach were clo&s;ed any Way, therefore if the King's Severity could not be
prevailed upon, wi&s;hed it concluded by the Marriage; which neither him|&s;elf
nor They upon whom He mo&s;t depended, would ever be brought to
con&s;ent to; &s;o that all the Jealou&s;ies and Animo&s;ities in the Court or State,
came to play their own Prizes in the widening or accommodating this<MILESTONE N="30">
Contention: In the Conclu&s;ion, on a &s;udden, contrary to the Expectation
of any Man of either Party, the Gentleman was immediately &s;ent out of
the Kingdom, under the Formality of a temporary and &s;hort Bani&s;hment,
and the Lady commended to her Friends, to be taken care of till her De|livery;
and from that Time never Word more &s;poken of the Bu&s;ine&s;s, nor
&s;hall their Names ever come upon the Stage by any Record of mine: It
was only ob&s;erved, that at this Time there was a great Change in the
Friend&s;hips of the Court, and in tho&s;e of the Marquis of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who
came now into the Queen's Confidence, towards whom He had always

<P>Now after a Widowhood of near three Years, Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> inclined again

other Thoughts but of his Profe&s;&s;ion, to the which He betook him&s;elf very

<P>HIS Father had long &s;uffered under an Indi&s;po&s;ition (even before the

Stone, without being exerci&s;ed with the pre&s;ent Sen&s;e of it; but from the
Time He was &s;ixty Years of Age, it increa&s;ed very much, and four or
five Years before his Death, with Circum&s;tances &s;carce heard of before,
and the Cau&s;es whereof are not yet under&s;tood by any Phy&s;ician; He
<MILESTONE N="20">was very often, both in the Day and the Night, forced to make Water,
&s;eldom in any Quantity, becau&s;e He could not retain it long enough, and
in the Clo&s;e of that Work, without any &s;harp Pain in tho&s;e Parts, He
was &s;till and con&s;tantly &s;eized on by &s;o &s;harp a Pain in the left Arm, for
Half a Quarter of an Hour, or near &s;o much, that the Torment made
him as pale (whereas He was otherwi&s;e of a very &s;anguine Complexion) as

Death, and He &s;hould die in one of tho&s;e Fits&endq;; as &s;oon as it was over,
which was quickly, He was the chearfulle&s;t Man living; eat well &s;uch
Things as He could fancy, walked, &s;lept, dige&s;ted, conver&s;ed with &s;uch
<MILESTONE N="30">a Promptne&s;s and Vivacity upon all Arguments (for He was <HI>omnifariam

Image of Death &s;o con&s;tantly before him in tho&s;e continual Torments, that
for many Years before his Death, He always parted with his Son, as to
&s;ee him no more; and at Parting &s;till &s;hewed him his Will, di&s;cour&s;ing

for the Conver&s;ation of many of his Family who lived there, and not

Journey in the Service of the King, and from him went to the Church<MILESTONE N="10">
to a Sermon, where He found him&s;elf a little pre&s;&s;ed as He u&s;ed to be,
and therefore thought fit to make what Ha&s;te He could to his Hou&s;e, and
was no &s;ooner come thither into a lower Room, than having made Water,
and the Pain in his Arm &s;eizing upon him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And Death.</NOTE> He fell down dead, without
the lea&s;t Motion of any Limb: The Suddenne&s;s of it made it apprehended
to be an Apoplexy, but there being nothing like Convul&s;ions, or the lea&s;t
Di&s;tortion or Alteration in the Vi&s;age, it is not like to be from that Cau&s;e,
nor could the Phy&s;icians make any rea&s;onable Gue&s;s from whence that
mortal Blow proceeded. He wanted about &s;ix Weeks of attaining the
Age of &s;eventy, and was the greate&s;t In&s;tance of the Felicity of a Coun|try<MILESTONE N="20">
Life that was &s;een in that Age; having enjoyed a competent, and to
him a plentiful Fortune, a very great Reputation of Piety and Virtue, and
his Death being attended with univer&s;al Lamentation. It cannot be ex|pre&s;&s;ed
with what Agony his Son bore this Lo&s;s, having as He was u&s;ed
to &s;ay, &startq;not only lo&s;t the be&s;t Father, but the be&s;t Friend and the be&s;t
Companion He ever had or could have;&endq; and He was never &s;o well
plea&s;ed, as when He had fit Occa&s;ions given him to mention his Father,
whom He did in Truth believe to be the wi&s;e&s;t Man He had ever known,
and He was often heard to &s;ay, in the Time when his Condition was at
highe&s;t, &startq;that though God Almighty had been very propitious to him, in<MILESTONE N="30">
rai&s;ing him to great Honours and Preferments, He did not value any
Honour He had &s;o much, as the being the Son of &s;uch a Father and
Mother, for who&s;e Sakes principally He thought God had conferred tho&s;e
Ble&s;&s;ings upon him.&endq;</P>
<P>THERE fell out at this Time or thereabouts, a great Alteration in the
Court and State, by the Death of the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> Lord High Trea|&s;urer
of <HI>England.</HI> The King from the Death of the Duke of <HI>Bucking|ham</HI>
had not only been very re&s;erved in his Bounty, but &s;o frugal in his
own Expen&s;e, that He had retrenched much of what had formerly i&s;&s;ued
out for his Hou&s;hold, in&s;omuch as every Year &s;omewhat had been paid of<MILESTONE N="40">
his Debts. He re&s;olved now to govern his Trea&s;ury by Commi&s;&s;ion, and
to take a con&s;tant Account of it; and thereby to di&s;cover what had been
of late done ami&s;s:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Trea|&s;urer's Office given to Com|mi&s;&s;ioners.</NOTE> The Commi&s;&s;ioners He appointed were, the Lord
Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> Dr. <HI>Laud,</HI> (formerly Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI>) the
Lord Keeper <HI>Coventry,</HI> and other principal Officers of State, who together
with the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> (who was Chancellor of the Exchequer, and by
his Office of the Quorum in that Commi&s;&s;ion) were to &s;upply the Office
of Trea&s;urer in all Particulars. The Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> who till
now had only intended the good Government of the Church, without in|termeddling
in &s;ecular Affairs, otherwi&s;e than when the Di&s;cipline of the<MILESTONE N="50">
Church was concerned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of whom Archbi&s;hop <HI>Laud</HI> is one.</NOTE> in which He was very &s;trict, both in the high
Commi&s;&s;ion, and in all other Places, where He &s;at as a privy Coun&s;ellor,
well fore&s;eeing, as He made manife&s;t upon &s;everal Occa&s;ions, the Growth
<PB N="11" REF="18">
of the <HI>Schi&s;maticks,</HI> and that if They were not with Rigour &s;uppre&s;&s;ed,
They would put the whole Kingdom into a Flame, which &s;hortly after
fell out to be too confe&s;&s;ed a Truth; though for the pre&s;ent his Providence
only &s;erved to increa&s;e the Number of his Enemies, who had from that
his Zeal contracted all the Malice again&s;t him that can be imagined, and
which He, out of the Con&s;cience of his Duty, and the Purity of his In|tentions,
and his Knowledge of the King's full Approbation of his Vigi|lance
and Ardour, too much undervalued; I &s;ay, as &s;oon as He was made
Commi&s;&s;ioner of the Trea&s;ury, He thought him&s;elf obliged to take all the
<MILESTONE N="10">Pains He could to under&s;tand that Employment, and the Nature of the
Revenue, and to find out all po&s;&s;ible Ways for the Improvement thereof,
and for the pre&s;ent Managery of the Expen&s;e. Many were of Opinion
that He was the more &s;olicitous in that Di&s;qui&s;ition, and the more in|qui&s;itive
into what had been done, that He might make &s;ome Di&s;co|very
of pa&s;t Actions, which might reflect upon the Memory of the
late Trea&s;urer, the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> and call his Wi&s;dom and In|tegrity
in Que&s;tion, who had been &s;o far from being his Friend, That
He had always laboured to do him all the Mi&s;chief He could, and
it was no &s;mall Grief of Heart to him, and much Occa&s;ion of his ill
<MILESTONE N="20">Humour, to find that the Archbi&s;hop had too much Credit with the King,
to be &s;haken by him; and the Archbi&s;hop was not in his Affections be|hind
hand with him, looking always upon him as a <HI>Roman Catholick,</HI>
though He di&s;&s;embled it by going to Church; and as the great Counte|nancer
and Support of that Religion; all his Family being of that Pro|fe&s;&s;ion,
and very few re&s;orting to it, or having any Credit with him but
&s;uch: It is very true, the Archbi&s;hop had no great Regard for his Me|mory,
or for his Friends, and was willing enough to make any Di&s;covery
of his Mi&s;carriages, and to inform his Maje&s;ty of them, who He believed
had too good an Opinion of him and his Integrity.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30">THE Truth is, the Archbi&s;hop had laid down one Principle to him&s;elf,
which He believed would much advance the King's Service, and was with|out
Doubt very prudent; that the King's Duties being provided for, and
chearfully paid, the Merchants &s;hould receive all the Countenance and
Protection from the King that They could expect; and not be liable to
the Vexation particular Men gave them for their private Advantage; being
forward enough to receive Propo&s;itions which tended to the King's Profit,
but careful that what accrued of Burthen to the Subject, &s;hould redound
entirely to the Benefit of the Crown, and not enrich Projectors at the
Charge of the People; and there is Rea&s;on to believe that if this Mea&s;ure
<MILESTONE N="40">had been well ob&s;erved, much of that Murmur had been prevented, which
contributed to that Jealou&s;y and Di&s;content which &s;oon after brake out.
This Vigilance and Inclination in the Archbi&s;hop, opened a Door to the
Admi&s;&s;ion of any Merchants or others to him, who gave him Information
of this Kind; and who being ready to pay any Thing to the King, de|&s;ired
only to be protected from private Oppre&s;&s;ions. The Archbi&s;hop u&s;ed
to &s;pend as much Time as He could get, at his Country Hou&s;e at <HI>Croydon,</HI>
and then his Mind being unbent from Bu&s;ine&s;s, He delighted in the Con|ver&s;ation
of his Neighbours, and treated them with great Urbanity.</P>
<P>THERE was a Merchant of the greate&s;t Reputation, <HI>(Daniel Harvey)</HI>
<MILESTONE N="50">who having a Country Hou&s;e within the Di&s;tance of a few Miles from <HI>Croy|don,</HI>
and under&s;tanding the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s of Trade more exactly than mo&s;t
Men, was always very welcome to the Archbi&s;hop, who u&s;ed to a&s;k him
many Que&s;tions upon &s;uch Matters as He de&s;ired to be informed in; and
<PB N="12" REF="19">
received much Satisfaction from him. Upon an Accidental Di&s;cour&s;e be|tween
them, what Encouragement Merchants ought to receive, who
brought a great Trade into the Kingdom, and paid thereupon great Sums
of Money to the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Harvey</HI>'s Complaint to the Archbi&s;hop of the Earl of <HI>Portland.</HI></NOTE> Mr. <HI>Harvey</HI> mentioned the Di&s;couragements They
had received in the late Times, by the Rigour of the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> in
Matters that related nothing to the King's Service, but to the Profit of
private Men; and thereupon remembered a Particular, that, after the Di&s;|&s;olution
of the Parliament in the fourth Year of the King, and the Com|bination
among&s;t many Merchants to pay no more Cu&s;toms or Impo&s;i|tions
to the King, becau&s;e They had not been granted in Parliament,<MILESTONE N="10">
which produced tho&s;e Suits and Decrees in the Exchequer, which are ge|nerally
under&s;tood, and a general Di&s;traction in Trade; many Merchants
of the greate&s;t Wealth and Reputation re&s;olved to continue the Trade;
and in a &s;hort Time reduced it into &s;o good Order, and by their Advice
and Example di&s;po&s;ed others to make a punctual Entry of their Goods,
and to pay their Duties to the King, that the Trade &s;eemed to be re&s;tored
to the Nation, and the Cu&s;toms to ri&s;e above the Value They had ever
yielded to the Crown; which was no &s;ooner brought to pa&s;s, than the Earl
of <HI>Portland</HI> (who endeavoured to per&s;uade the King that this great Work
was entirely compa&s;&s;ed by his Wi&s;dom, Intere&s;t, and Dexterity) di&s;obliged<MILESTONE N="20">
the Merchants in a very &s;en&s;ible Degree, in requiring them to unlade their
Ships at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Quay, and at no other Quay or Wharf, upon
Pretence that thereby the King would have his Cu&s;toms well paid, of
which otherwi&s;e He would be in Danger to be cozened; and alledged an
Order that had been formerly made in the Court of the Exchequer,
that fine Goods which were portable (as Silks and fine Linens) and might
ea&s;ily be &s;tolen, &s;hould always be landed at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Quay: The
Merchants looked upon this Con&s;traint and Re&s;traint, as a great Oppre&s;|&s;ion,
and applied them&s;elves to him for Reparation and Redre&s;s; They
undertook to make it evident to him, that it was merely a Matter which<MILESTONE N="30">
concerned the private Benefit of the particular Wharfingers, and not in
the lea&s;t Degree the King's Profit; that the Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e Quay was of
great Value to the Owner of it, who had a very great Rent for it, but
that it yielded the King nothing, nor would in fifty Years or thereabouts,
there being a Lea&s;e yet to come for that Term; that the Mention of fine
Goods, and the Order of the Exchequer, was not applicable to the Que&s;|tion;
that They di&s;puted not the Landing of fine Goods, but that the
Pretence was to compel them to bring their gro&s;&s;e&s;t, and their Merchandize
of the greate&s;t Bulk to that Quay, whereas They had been always free
to &s;hip or un&s;hip &s;uch Goods at what Wharf They would chufe for their<MILESTONE N="40">
Conveniences; there being the &s;worn Waiters of the Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e at|tending
in the one, as well as the other; that the re&s;training them to one
Wharf, and obliging all the Ships to be brought thither, mu&s;t prove much
to their Prejudice, and make them depend upon the good Will of the
Wharfinger for their Di&s;patch, who in Truth, let his De&s;ire be never &s;o
good, could not be able to perform the Service, without obliging them to
wait very long, and thereby to lo&s;e their Markets: All this Di&s;cour&s;e how
rea&s;onable &s;oever, made no Impre&s;&s;ion upon the Trea&s;urer, but He di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed
them with his u&s;ual Roughne&s;s, and reproached them that They
de&s;ired all Occa&s;ions to cozen the King of his Cu&s;toms; which They<MILESTONE N="50">
looked upon as an ill Reward for the Service They had done, and a great
Di&s;couragement to Trade. The Archbi&s;hop heard this Di&s;cour&s;e with great
Trouble and Indignation, and being then interrupted by the Coming of
<PB N="13" REF="20">
Per&s;ons of Quality, told him, He would &s;ome other Time run over all
the&s;e Particulars again, and that He &s;hould recollect him&s;elf for other In|&s;tances
of that &s;trange Nature.</P>
<P>THE next Time the Archbi&s;hop returned to <HI>Croydon,</HI> which He u&s;ually
did once in the Week during the Summer, and &s;taid a Day or two, impa|tient
to under&s;tand more of the Matter, He &s;ent for Mr. <HI>Harvey,</HI> and told
him, &startq;that his la&s;t Di&s;cour&s;e had given him much Cau&s;e of Sorrow, in
finding how the King had been u&s;ed, and that He knew his Nature &s;o
well, that He could confidently &s;ay, that He never knew of that Kind
<MILESTONE N="10">of Proceeding, and that He wondered that the Merchants had not then
petitioned the King, to hear the Matter him&s;elf;&endq; He an&s;wered, &startq;that
They had left no Way unattempted for their Ea&s;e, having no Fear of
di&s;plea&s;ing the Trea&s;urer; that They had cau&s;ed a Petition to be drawn
by their Council, which was &s;igned by all the principal Merchants in
the City, wherein (to obviate the Calumny concerning refu&s;ing to pay,
or &s;tealing Cu&s;toms) They declared, that They were all very willing to
pay all Duties to his Maje&s;ty, and would never refu&s;e the &s;ame, (which
was a Declaration, would have been much valued a Year or two before,
and ought to have been &s;o then) only de&s;ired to be left at Liberty to &s;hip
<MILESTONE N="20">and land their Goods as They had been accu&s;tomed to; that They had
given this Petition to a Secretary of State to pre&s;ent it to the King, who
referred it to the Con&s;ideration of the Trea&s;urer; and thereupon They
pur&s;ued it no further, knowing how He &s;tood re&s;olved, and the Cau&s;e
of it, which troubled them mo&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> that that Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e Quay
did, though not in his own Name, in Truth belong to Sir <HI>Abraham
Dawes,</HI> one of the Farmers of the Cu&s;toms, and the only Favourite of
the Lord Trea&s;urer, all the other Farmers being offended with the Or|der,
which They &s;aw would offend the Merchants:&endq; The Archbi&s;hop
a&s;ked &startq;where that Petition was, that He thought it &s;till of that Moment,
<MILESTONE N="30">that He would be glad to &s;ee it:&endq; He an&s;wered, &startq;He knew not where
it was; but He believed it to remain in the Hands of Mr. <HI>Hyde;</HI> who
had drawn it, and was of Council with the Merchants throughout the
whole Proceedings; and was &s;o warm in it, that He had exceedingly
provoked the Lord Trea&s;urer, who would have ruined him if He could:&endq;
He a&s;ked who that Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> was, and where He was; the other &s;aid,
He was a young Lawyer of the <HI>Middle Temple,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Harvey <HI>mentions Mr.</HI> Hyde <HI>to the Archbi&s;hop.</HI></NOTE> who was not afraid of
being of Council with them, when all Men of Name dur&s;t not appear
for them; and that He was confident that He, having been always pre|&s;ent
at all Debates, remembered many Circum&s;tances in the Bu&s;ine&s;s
<MILESTONE N="40">which the other had forgotten; that He was generally known; and had
lately married the Daughter of Sir <HI>Thomas Ayle&s;bury.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>WITHIN a few Days after, the Archbi&s;hop meeting Sir <HI>Thomas Ayle&s;|bury</HI>
at Court, a&s;ked him whether He had married his Daughter to one
Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> a Lawyer, and where He was; He an&s;wered, He had done &s;o,
and that He lived in his Hou&s;e, when He was not at his Chamber in the
<HI>Middle Temple:</HI> The Archbi&s;hop de&s;ired him to &s;end him to Him, for He
heard well of him;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Hyde <HI>at|tends the Archbi&s;hop.</HI></NOTE> and the next Morning He attended him, and found
him walking alone in his Garden at <HI>Lambeth;</HI> He received him civilly ac|cording
to his Manner, without much Ceremony; and pre&s;ently a&s;ked
<MILESTONE N="50">him, whether He had not been of Council with &s;ome Merchants in &s;uch
a Bu&s;ine&s;s, and where that Petition now was; He an&s;wered him, not
knowing why He a&s;ked, &startq;that He had been about two Years pa&s;t, of
&startq;Council with &s;ome Merchants about &s;uch an Affair, in which the Earl
<PB N="14" REF="21">
of <HI>Portland</HI> had been much incen&s;ed again&s;t him, that He remembered
He had drawn &s;uch a Petition, which was &s;igned by all the con&s;iderable
Merchants of <HI>London,</HI> but that there was little Progre&s;s made thereupon,
by Rea&s;on of the A&s;perity of the Trea&s;urer:&endq; He a&s;ked &s;till for the
Petition that was &s;o &s;igned; He told him, He thought He had it him&s;elf,
if He had it not, He was confident He could find who had it: He de|&s;ired
him, that He would find it out, and bring it to Him, and any other
Papers concerning that Affair, or the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Cu&s;toms: He &s;aid,
&startq;the King had, contrary to his De&s;ire, made him one of the Commi&s;|&s;ioners
of the Trea&s;ury; that He under&s;tood nothing of that Province,<MILESTONE N="10">
but was willing to take any Pains which might enable him to do his
Ma&s;ter Service, which made him inqui&s;itive into the Cu&s;toms, the prin|cipal
Branch of the Revenue; that his Neighbour <HI>Daniel Harvey</HI> had
&s;poken much Good of him to Him; and informed him of that Com|plaint
of the Merchants, which He thought had much Rea&s;on in it, but
it was like other Acts of the Earl of <HI>Portland;</HI> that He would be wil|ling
to receive any Information from him, and that He &s;hould be wel|come
when He came to him.&endq; He told him, in &s;hort (which He heard
would plea&s;e him be&s;t) two or three Pa&s;&s;ages that happened in that Tran&s;action;
and &s;ome haughty Expre&s;&s;ions which fell from the Trea&s;urer, when<MILESTONE N="20">
upon his urging that the Farmers would not hold their Farm, if He did
not &s;trictly hold the Merchants to Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e Quay; He told him,
&startq;that if the Farmers were weary of their Bargain, He would help
the King to forty thou&s;and Pounds a Year above the Rent They paid,
and that They &s;hould be paid all the Money They had advanced within
one Week;&endq; upon which the Earl indeed had let him&s;elf out into an
indecent Rage, u&s;ing many Threats to him; which He found was not in|grateful
to the Archbi&s;hop, upon whom He attended within a Day or two
again, and delivered him the Petition, and many other u&s;eful Papers,
which plea&s;ed him abundantly; and He required him to &s;ee Him often.<MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>By this Accident Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> came fir&s;t to be known to the Archbi&s;hop,
who ever afterwards u&s;ed him very kindly, and &s;poke well of him upon
all Occa&s;ions, and took particular Notice of him when He came of Coun|cil
in any Cau&s;es depending at the Council Board, as He did frequently;
and de&s;ired his Service in many Occa&s;ions, and particularly in the rai&s;ing
Monies for the building St. <HI>Paul's</HI> Church, in which He made a Journey
or two into <HI>Wilt&s;hire</HI> with good Succe&s;s; which the Archbi&s;hop &s;till ac|knowledged,
in a more obliging Way than He was accu&s;tomed to; in&s;o|much
as it was &s;o much taken notice of, that Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> (who well knew
how to cultivate tho&s;e Advantages) was u&s;ed with more Countenance by<MILESTONE N="40">
all the Judges in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Hyde <HI>re|ceives Encou|ragement in his Profe&s;&s;ion.</HI></NOTE> and the eminent Practi&s;ers, than was
u&s;ually given to Men of his Years; &s;o that He grew every Day in Prac|tice,
of which He had as much as He de&s;ired, and having a competent
E&s;tate of his own, He enjoyed a very plea&s;ant and a plentiful Life, living
much above the Rank of tho&s;e Lawyers, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s was only to be
rich; and was generally beloved and e&s;teemed by mo&s;t Per&s;ons of Condi|tion
and great Reputation. Though He pur&s;ued his Profe&s;&s;ion with great
Diligence and Intentne&s;s of Mind, and upon the Matter wholly betook
him&s;elf to Bu&s;ine&s;s, yet He made not him&s;elf a Slave to it; but kept both
his Friends at Court, and about the Town, by his frequent Application and<MILESTONE N="50">
con&s;tant Conver&s;ation;<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Method of &s;pending his Time.</NOTE> in Order to which, He always gave him&s;elf at
Dinner to tho&s;e who u&s;ed to meet together at that Hour, and in &s;uch
Places as was mutually agreed between them; where They enjoyed them|&s;elves
<PB N="15" REF="22">
with great Delight, and publick Reputation, for the Innocence, and
Sharpne&s;s, and Learning of their Conver&s;ation: For He would never &s;uffer
him&s;elf to be deprived of &s;ome Hours (which commonly He borrowed
from the Night) to refre&s;h him&s;elf with polite Learning, in which He &s;till
made &s;ome Progre&s;s: The Afternoons He entirely dedicated to the Bu|&s;ine&s;s
of his Profe&s;&s;ion, taking In&s;tructions and the like; and very rarely
&s;upped, except He was called out by &s;ome of his Friends, who &s;pared him
the more, becau&s;e He always complied with tho&s;e Summons; otherwi&s;e
He never &s;upped, for many Years (before the Troubles brought in that
<MILESTONE N="10">Cu&s;tom) both for the gaining that Time for him&s;elf, and that He might
ri&s;e early in the Morning according to his Cu&s;tom, and which He would
&s;ay, He could never do when He &s;upped. The Vacations He gave wholly
to his Study and Conver&s;ation, never going out of <HI>London</HI> in tho&s;e Sea&s;ons,
except for two Months in the Summer, which He &s;pent at his own Hou&s;e
in the Country, with great Chearfulne&s;s among&s;t his Friends, who then
re&s;orted to him in good Numbers.</P>
<P>HE never did ride any Country Circuits with the Judges, which He
often repented afterwards, &s;aying, that be&s;ides the knowing the Gentry,
and People, and Manners of <HI>England</HI> (which is be&s;t attained that Way)
<MILESTONE N="20">there is a very good and nece&s;&s;ary Part of the Learning in the Law, which
is not &s;o ea&s;ily got any other Way, as in riding tho&s;e Circuits, which as it
&s;eems to have much of Drudgery, &s;o is accompanied with much Plea&s;ure
and Profit; and it may be, the long Lives of Men of that Profe&s;&s;ion (for
the Lawyers u&s;ually live to more Years than any other Profe&s;&s;ion) may
very rea&s;onably be imputed to the Exerci&s;e They give them&s;elves by their
Circuits, as well as to their other Acts of Temperance and Sobriety: And
as He had denied him&s;elf that Satisfaction purely to have that Time to
him&s;elf for other Delight, &s;o He did re&s;olve, if the Confu&s;ion of the
Time had not &s;urprized him, for three or four Years, (longer He did not
<MILESTONE N="30">intend) to have improved him&s;elf by the Experience of tho&s;e Journies.</P>
<P>HE was often heard to &s;ay, that, &startq;next the immediate Ble&s;&s;ing and
Providence of God Almighty, which had pre&s;erved him throughout the
whole Cour&s;e of his Life (le&s;s &s;trict than it ought to have been) from
many Dangers and Di&s;advantages, in which many other young Men
were lo&s;t; He owed all the little He knew, and the little Good that
was in him, to the Friend&s;hips and Conver&s;ation He had &s;till been u&s;ed
to, of the mo&s;t excellent Men in their &s;everal Kinds that lived in that
Age; by who&s;e Learning, and Information, and In&s;truction, He formed
his Studies, and mended his Under&s;tanding; and by who&s;e Gentlene&s;s

&s;uch, that He would have been thought to have been bred in the be&s;t Courts,
but that his good Nature, Charity, and Delight in doing good, and in

Writings &s;eems har&s;h and &s;ometimes ob&s;cure; which is not wholly to be
imputed to the ab&s;tru&s;e Subjects of which He commonly treated, out of

a Stile, and too much Propen&s;ity to the Language of Antiquity; but in

They were in Rebellion, and in the wor&s;t Times, which his Age obliged
him to do; and how wicked &s;oever the Actions were, which were every

would have hindered them if He could, with his own Safety, to which
He was always enough indulgent. If He had &s;ome Infirmities with other<MILESTONE N="50">

CHARLES COTTON was a Gentleman born to a competent Fortune,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Mr.</HI> Cot|ton.</NOTE> and
&s;o qualified in his Per&s;on, and Education, that for many Years He conti|nued
the greate&s;t Ornament of the Town, in the E&s;teem of tho&s;e who
had been be&s;t bred: His natural Parts were very great, his Wit flowing in
all the Parts of Conver&s;ation; the Super&s;tructure of Learning not rai&s;ed
to a con&s;iderable Height, but having pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome Years in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and
then in <HI>France,</HI> and conver&s;ing always with learned Men, his Expre&s;&s;ions
were ever proper, and &s;ignificant, and gave great Lu&s;tre to his Di&s;cour&s;e,
upon any Argument; &s;o that He was thought by tho&s;e who were not intimate
<MILESTONE N="10">with him, to have been much better acquainted with Books than He was.
He had all tho&s;e Qualities which in Youth rai&s;e Men to the Reputation of
being fine Gentlemen; &s;uch a Plea&s;antne&s;s and Gaiety of Humour, &s;uch

&s;upported by as extraordinary a Clearne&s;s of Courage, and Fearle&s;&s;ne&s;s of
Spirit, of which He gave too often Manife&s;tation. Some unhappy Suits
in Law, and Wa&s;te of his Fortune in tho&s;e Suits, made &s;ome Impre&s;&s;ion
upon his Mind; which being improved by dome&s;tick Afflictions, and tho&s;e
<MILESTONE N="20">Indulgences to him&s;elf, which naturally attend tho&s;e Afflictions, rendered

<P>JOHN VAUGHAN was then a Student of the Law in the <HI>Inner Temple,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Mr.</HI> Vaughan.</NOTE>
but at that Time indulged more to the politer Learning; and was in

entire Tru&s;t and Friend&s;hip with him, and to that owed the be&s;t Part of
his Reputation; for He was of &s;o magi&s;terial and &s;upercilious a Humour,
&s;o proud and in&s;olent a Behaviour, that all Mr. <HI>Selden</HI>'s In&s;tructions, and
<MILESTONE N="30">Authority, and Example, could not file off that Roughne&s;s of his Na|ture,
&s;o as to make him very grateful. He looked mo&s;t into tho&s;e Parts
of the Law, which di&s;po&s;ed him to lea&s;t Reverence to the Crown, and
mo&s;t, to popular Authority; yet without Inclination to any Change in Go|vernment;
and therefore, before the Beginning of the Civil War, and when
He clearly di&s;cerned the Approaches to it in Parliament (of which He was
a Member) He withdrew him&s;elf into the Fa&s;tne&s;&s;es of his own Country,
<HI>North Wales,</HI> where He enjoyed a &s;ecure, and as near an innocent Life,
as the Iniquity of that Time would permit; and upon the Return of

that Party.</P>

but He excu&s;ed him&s;elf upon his long Di&s;continuance (having not worn his

him, which were more fixed by a wonderful graceful Behaviour, a flow|ing
Courte&s;y and Civility, and &s;uch a Volubility of Language, as &s;ur|prized,

&s;eemed natural to his Size, and Mould of his Per&s;on, to the Gravity of his<MILESTONE N="10">

in Arms, of which He gave an early Te&s;timony in his Youth, in

which, upon an Injury received, or apprehended from the <HI>Venetians,</HI> He
encountered their whole Fleet, killed many of their Men, and &s;unk one
of their Galea&s;&s;es; which in that drow&s;y and unactive Time, was looked
upon with a general E&s;timation, though the Crown di&s;avowed it. In a
Word, He had all the Advantages that Nature, and Art, and an excellent<MILESTONE N="20">
Education could give him, which, with a great Confidence and Pre&s;entne&s;s
of Mind, buoyed him up again&s;t all tho&s;e Prejudices, and Di&s;advantages,
(as the Attainder, and Execution of his Father, for a Crime of the highe&s;t
Nature; his own Marriage with a Lady, though of an extraordinary Beauty,
of as extraordinary a Fame; his changing, and re-changing his Religion;
and &s;ome per&s;onal Vices, and Licences in his Life) which would have &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed

but very well became an Imperfection in his Speech, which was a
great Mortification to him, and kept him from entering upon any Di&s;|cour&s;e

Nation, which united them&s;elves in recommending another Gentleman to
it; of &s;o great Value were tho&s;e Relations held in that Age, when Ma|je&s;ty

of the Language, in which that Fancy was &s;pread, were at lea&s;t
equal, if not &s;uperior to any of that Time: But his Glory was, that

<P>WITH Sir <HI>Lucius Carey</HI> He had a mo&s;t entire Friend&s;hip without Re|&s;erve,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Sir</HI> Lucius Carey.</NOTE>
from his Age of twenty Years, to the Hour of his Death, near
twenty Years after; upon which there will be Occa&s;ion to enlarge when

&s;ay no more of him in this Place, than to &s;hew his Condition, and Qualifi|cations,
which were the fir&s;t Ingredients into that Friend&s;hip; which was
afterwards cultivated, and improved by a con&s;tant Conver&s;ation and Fami|liarity,
<MILESTONE N="50">and by many Accidents which contributed thereto. He had the
Advantage of a noble Extraction, and of being born his Father's elde&s;t Son,
when there was a greater Fortune in Pro&s;pect to be inherited (be&s;ides what
He might rea&s;onably expect by his Mother) than came afterwards to his
<PB N="20" REF="27">
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. His Education was equal to his Birth, at lea&s;t in the Care, if
not in the Climate; for his Father being Deputy of <HI>Ireland,</HI> before He
was of Age fit to be &s;ent abroad, his Breeding was in the Court, and in
the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Dublin;</HI> but under the Care, Vigilance, and Direction
of &s;uch Governors and Tutors, that He learned all tho&s;e Exerci&s;es and Lan|guages,
better than mo&s;t Men do in more celebrated Places; in&s;omuch as
when He came into <HI>England,</HI> which was when He was about the Age of
eighteen Years, He was not only Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue, and had
read all the Poets, and other of the be&s;t Authors with notable Judgment
for that Age, but He under&s;tood, and &s;pake, and writ <HI>French,</HI> as if He<MILESTONE N="10">
had &s;pent many Years in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>HE had another Advantage, which was a great Ornament to the re&s;t,
that was, a good, a plentiful E&s;tate, of which He had the early Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.
His Mother was the &s;ole Daughter and Heir of the Lord Chief Baron <HI>Tan|field,</HI>
who having given a fair Portion with his Daughter in Marriage, had
kept him&s;elf free to di&s;po&s;e of his Land, and his other E&s;tate, in &s;uch
Manner as He &s;hould think fit; and He &s;ettled it in &s;uch Manner upon
his Grand&s;on Sir <HI>Lucius Carey,</HI> without taking Notice of his Father, or
Mother, that upon his Grandmother's Death, which fell out about the
Time that He was nineteen Years of Age, all the Land, with two very<MILESTONE N="20">
good Hou&s;es very well furni&s;hed (worth above &pound;2000 <HI>per Annum</HI>) in a
mo&s;t plea&s;ant Country, and the two mo&s;t plea&s;ant Places in that Country,
with a very plentiful per&s;onal E&s;tate, fell into his Hands and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,
and to his entire Di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P>WITH the&s;e Advantages, He had one great Di&s;advantage (which in the
fir&s;t Entrance into the World is attended with too much Prejudice) in his
Per&s;on and Pre&s;ence, which was in no Degree attractive or promi&s;ing:
His Stature was low, and &s;maller than mo&s;t Men; his Motion not grace|ful;
and his A&s;pect &s;o far from inviting, that it had &s;omewhat in it of Simplicity;
and his Voice the wor&s;t of the three, and &s;o untuned, that in|&s;tead<MILESTONE N="30">
of reconciling, it offended the Ear, &s;o that no Body would have ex|pected
Mu&s;ick from that Tongue; and &s;ure no Man was le&s;s behold&egrave;n to
Nature for its Recommendation into the World; but then no Man &s;ooner,
or more di&s;appointed this general and cu&s;tomary Prejudice; that little
Per&s;on and &s;mall Stature was quickly found to contain a great Heart, a
Courage &s;o keen, and a Nature &s;o fearle&s;s, that no Compo&s;ition of the
&s;tronge&s;t Limbs, and mo&s;t harmonious and proportioned Pre&s;ence and
Strength, ever more di&s;po&s;ed any Man to the greate&s;t Enterprize; it being
his greate&s;t Weakne&s;s to be too &s;olicitous for &s;uch Adventures; and that
untuned Tongue and Voice, ea&s;ily di&s;covered it&s;elf to be &s;upplied, and go|verned,<MILESTONE N="40">
by a Mind and Under&s;tanding &s;o excellent, that the Wit and
Weight of all He &s;aid, carried another Kind of Lu&s;tre, and Admiration in
it, and even another Kind of Acceptation from the Per&s;ons pre&s;ent, than
any Ornament of Delivery could rea&s;onably promi&s;e it&s;elf, or is u&s;ually at|tended
with; and his Di&s;po&s;ition and Nature was &s;o gentle and obliging,
&s;o much delighted in Courte&s;y, Kindne&s;s, and Genero&s;ity, that all Mankind
could not but admire, and love him.</P>
<P>IN a &s;hort Time after He had Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the E&s;tate his Grandfather
had left him, and before He was of Age, He committed a Fault again&s;t
his Father, in marrying a young Lady, whom He pa&s;&s;ionately loved, without<MILESTONE N="50">
any con&s;iderable Portion, which exceedingly offended him; and di&s;appointed
all his rea&s;onable Hopes and Expectation, of redeeming and repairing
his own broken Fortune, and de&s;perate Hopes in Court, by &s;ome
<PB N="21" REF="28">
advantageous Marriage of his Son; about which He had then &s;ome pro|bable
Treaty. Sir <HI>Lucius Carey</HI> was very con&s;cious to him&s;elf of his
Offence and Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and the Con&s;equence of it, which though
He could not repent, having married a Lady of a mo&s;t extraordinary
Wit, and Judgment, and of the mo&s;t &s;ignal Virtue, and exemplary Life,
that the Age produced, and who brought him many hopeful Children,
in which He took great Delight; yet He confe&s;&s;ed it, with the mo&s;t &s;in|cere
and dutiful Applications to his Father for his Pardon, that could be
made; and for the Prejudice He had brought upon his Fortune, by bring|ing
<MILESTONE N="10">no Portion to him, He offered to repair it, by re&s;igning his whole
E&s;tate to his Di&s;po&s;al, and to rely wholly upon his Kindne&s;s for his
own Maintenance and Support; and to that Purpo&s;e, He had cau&s;ed
Conveyances to be drawn by Council, which He brought ready engro&s;&s;ed
to his Father, and was willing to &s;eal, and execute them, that They
might be valid; but his Father's Pa&s;&s;ion and Indignation &s;o far tran&s;|ported
him (though He was a Gentleman of excellent Parts,) that He
refu&s;ed any Reconciliation, and rejected all the Offers that were made
him of the E&s;tate; &s;o that his Son remained &s;till in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;&s;ion of his
E&s;tate again&s;t his Will; for which He found great Rea&s;on afterwards to
<MILESTONE N="20">rejoice; but He was for the pre&s;ent, &s;o much afflicted with his Father's
Di&s;plea&s;ure, that He tran&s;ported him&s;elf and his Wife into <HI>Holland,</HI> re|&s;olving
to buy &s;ome military Command, and to &s;pend the Remainder of
his Life in that Profe&s;&s;ion; but being di&s;appointed in the Treaty He ex|pected;
and finding no Opportunity to accommodate him&s;elf with &s;uch
a Command, He returned again into <HI>England;</HI> re&s;olving to retire to a
Country Life, and to his Books; that &s;ince He was not like to improve
him&s;elf in Arms, He might advance in Letters.</P>
<P>IN this Re&s;olution He was &s;o &s;evere (as He was always naturally very in|tent
upon what He was inclined to) that He declared, He would not &s;ee <HI>Lon|don</HI>
<MILESTONE N="30">in many Years, which was the Place He loved of all the World; and that
in his Studies, He would fir&s;t apply him&s;elf to the <HI>Greek,</HI> and pur&s;ue it with|out
Intermi&s;&s;ion, till He &s;hould attain to the full Under&s;tanding of that
Tongue; and it is hardly to be credited, what Indu&s;try He u&s;ed, and what
Succe&s;s attended that Indu&s;try; for though his Father's Death, by an un|happy
Accident, made his Repair to <HI>London</HI> ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, in fewer
Years, than He had propo&s;ed for his Ab&s;ence; yet He had fir&s;t made him|&s;elf
Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Greek</HI> Tongue (in the <HI>Latin</HI> He was very well ver&s;ed
before) and had read not only the <HI>Greek</HI> Hi&s;torians, but <HI>Homer</HI> likewi&s;e,
and &s;uch of the Poets as were worthy to be peru&s;ed.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40">THOUGH his Father's Death brought no other Convenience to him, but
a Title to redeem an E&s;tate, mortgaged for as much as it was worth, and
for which He was compelled to &s;ell a &s;iner Seat of his own; yet it im|po&s;ed
a Burthen upon him, of the Title of a Vi&s;count, and an Increa&s;e
of Expen&s;e, in which He was not in his Nature too provident, or re|&s;trained;
having naturally &s;uch a Genero&s;ity and Bounty in him, that He
&s;eemed to have his E&s;tate in Tru&s;t, for all worthy Per&s;ons, who &s;tood in
want of Supplies and Encouragement, as <HI>Ben. John&s;on,</HI> and many others
of that Time, who&s;e Fortunes required, and who&s;e Spirits made them &s;u|perior
to, ordinary Obligations; which yet They were contented to receive
<MILESTONE N="50">from Him, becau&s;e his Bounties were &s;o generou&s;ly di&s;tributed, and &s;o
much without Vanity and O&s;tentation, that except from tho&s;e few Per|&s;ons,
from whom He &s;ometimes received the Characters of fit Objects for
his Benefits, or whom He intru&s;ted, for the more &s;ecret deriving them to
<PB N="22" REF="29">
them, He did all He could, that the Per&s;ons them&s;elves who received them,
&s;hould not know from what Fountain They flowed; and when that could
not be concealed, He &s;u&s;tained any Acknowledgment from the Per&s;ons
obliged, with &s;o much Trouble, and Ba&s;hfulne&s;s, that They might well
perceive, that He was even a&s;hamed of the little He had given, and to re|ceive
&s;o large a Recompence for it.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as He had fini&s;hed all tho&s;e Tran&s;actions, which the Death of
his Father had made nece&s;&s;ary to be done, He retired again to his Coun|try
Life, and to his &s;evere Cour&s;e of Study, which was very delightful to
him, as &s;oon as He was engaged in it; but He was wont to &s;ay, that He<MILESTONE N="10">
never found Reluctancy in any Thing He re&s;olved to do, but in his quitting
<HI>London,</HI> and departing from the Conver&s;ation of tho&s;e He enjoyed there;
which was in &s;ome Degree pre&s;erved, and continued by frequent Letters,
and often Vi&s;its, which were made by his Friends from thence, whil&s;t He
continued wedded to the Country; and which were &s;o grateful to him,
that during their Stay with him, He looked upon no Book, except their
very Conver&s;ation made an Appeal to &s;ome Book; and truly his whole
Conver&s;ation was one continued <HI>Convivium Philo&s;ophicum,</HI> or <HI>Convivium
Theologicum,</HI> enlivened, and refre&s;hed with all the Facetiou&s;ne&s;s of Wit, and
Good-Humour, and Plea&s;antne&s;s of Di&s;cour&s;e, which made the Gravity<MILESTONE N="20">
of the Argument it&s;elf (whatever it was) very delectable. His Hou&s;e
where He u&s;ually re&s;ided (<HI>Tew,</HI> or <HI>Burford</HI> in <HI>Oxford&s;hire</HI>) being within ten
or twelve Miles of the Univer&s;ity, looked like the Univer&s;ity it&s;elf, by the
Company that was always found there. There were Dr. <HI>Sheldon,</HI> Dr.
<HI>Morley,</HI> Dr. <HI>Hammond,</HI> Dr. <HI>Earles,</HI> Mr. <HI>Chillingworth,</HI> and indeed all
Men of eminent Parts and Faculties in <HI>Oxford,</HI> be&s;ides tho&s;e who re&s;orted
thither from <HI>London;</HI> who all found their Lodgings there, as ready as in the
Colleges, nor did the Lord of the Hou&s;e know of their coming, or going,
nor who were in his Hou&s;e, till He came to Dinner, or Supper, where all
&s;till met; otherwi&s;e, there was no trouble&s;ome Ceremony, or Con&s;traint to<MILESTONE N="30">
forbid Men to come to the Hou&s;e, or to make them weary of &s;taying
there; &s;o that many came thither to &s;tudy in a better Air, finding all the
Books They could de&s;ire, in his Library, and all the Per&s;ons together,
who&s;e Company They could wi&s;h, and not find, in any other Society.
Here Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI> wrote, and formed, and modelled his excellent
Book again&s;t the learned Je&s;uit Mr. <HI>Nott,</HI> after frequent Debates upon the
mo&s;t important Particulars; in many of which, He &s;uffered him&s;elf to be
over-ruled by the Judgment of his Friends, though in others He &s;till ad|hered
to his own Fancy, which was &s;ceptical enough, even in the highe&s;t
Points.<MILESTONE N="40"></P>
<P>IN this happy and delightful Conver&s;ation, and Re&s;traint, He remained
in the Country many Years; and until He had made &s;o prodigious a Progre&s;s
in Learning, that there were very few cla&s;&s;ick Authors in the <HI>Greek,</HI> or
<HI>Latin</HI> Tongue, that He had not read with great Exactne&s;s; He had read
all the <HI>Greek,</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Fathers; all the mo&s;t allowed and authentick ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical
Writers; and all the Councils, with wonderful Care, and Ob&s;er|vation;
for in Religion He thought too careful, and too curious an En|quiry
could not be made, among&s;t tho&s;e, who&s;e Purity was not que&s;tioned,
and who&s;e Authority was con&s;tantly, and confidently urged, by Men who
were furthe&s;t from being of one Mind among&s;t them&s;elves; and for the<MILESTONE N="50">
mutual Support of their &s;everal Opinions, in which They mo&s;t contra|dicted
each other; and in all tho&s;e Controver&s;ies, He had &s;o di&s;pa&s;&s;ioned
a Con&s;ideration; &s;uch a Candour in his Nature, and &s;o profound a Charity
<PB N="23" REF="30">
in his Con&s;cience, that in tho&s;e Points, in which He was in his own Judg|ment
mo&s;t clear, He never thought the wor&s;e, or in any Degree declined
the Familiarity, of tho&s;e who were of another Mind; which, without
Que&s;tion, is an excellent Temper for the Propagation, and Advancement
of Chri&s;tianity. With the&s;e great Advantages of Indu&s;try, He had a Me|mory
retentive of all that He had ever read, and an Under&s;tanding and
Judgment to apply it &s;ea&s;onably and appo&s;itely, with the mo&s;t Dexterity
and Addre&s;s, and the lea&s;t Pedantry and Affectation, that ever Man, who
knew &s;o much, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with, of what Quality &s;oever: It is not a
<MILESTONE N="10">trivial Evidence of his Learning, his Wit, and his Candour, that may be
found in that Di&s;cour&s;e of his, again&s;t the Infallibility of the Church of
<HI>Rome,</HI> publi&s;hed &s;ince his Death, and from a Copy under his own Hand,
though not prepared and dige&s;ted by him for the Pre&s;s, and to which He
would have given &s;ome Ca&s;tigations.</P>
<P>BUT all his Parts, Abilities, and Faculties, by Art and Indu&s;try, were
not to be valued, or mentioned, in Compari&s;on of his mo&s;t accompli&s;hed
Mind and Manners; his Gentlene&s;s, and Affability was &s;o tran&s;cendent, and
obliging, that it drew Reverence, and &s;ome Kind of Compliance from the
roughe&s;t, and mo&s;t unpoli&s;hed, and &s;tubborn Con&s;titutions; and made
<MILESTONE N="20">them of another Temper in Debate, in his Pre&s;ence, than They were in
other Places: He was in his Nature &s;o &s;evere a Lover of Ju&s;tice, and &s;o
preci&s;e a Lover of Truth, that He was &s;uperior to all po&s;&s;ible Tempta|tions
for the Violation of either; indeed &s;o rigid an Exacter of Perfection,
in all tho&s;e Things which &s;eemed but to border upon either of them, and
by the common Practice of Men were not thought to border upon either,
that many who knew him very well, and loved, and admired his Virtue (as
all who did know him mu&s;t love, and admire it) did believe, that He was
of a Temper and Compo&s;ition, fitter to live in <HI>Republic&acirc; Platonis,</HI> than <HI>in
Faece Romuli;</HI> but this Rigidne&s;s was only exerci&s;ed towards him&s;elf; to|wards
<MILESTONE N="30">his Friend's Infirmities no man was more indulgent. In his Conver|&s;ation,
which was the mo&s;t chearful and plea&s;ant that can be imagined,
though He was young (for all I have yet &s;poken of him doth not exceed
his Age of twenty-five or twenty-&s;ix Years) and of great Gaiety in his Hu|mour,
with a flowing Delightfulne&s;s of Language, He had &s;o cha&s;te a
Tongue, and Ear, that there was never known a profane, or loo&s;e Word to
fall from him, nor in Truth in his Company; the Integrity, and Cleanli|ne&s;s
of the Wit of that Time, not exerci&s;ing it&s;elf in that Licence, be|fore
Per&s;ons for whom They had any E&s;teem.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Francis Wenman</HI> would not look upon him&s;elf under any other
<MILESTONE N="40">Character,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Sir</HI> Francis Wenman.</NOTE> than that of a Country Gentleman; though no Man of his
Quality in <HI>England</HI> was more e&s;teemed in Court. He was of a noble
Extraction, and of an ancient Family in <HI>Oxford&s;hire,</HI> where He was
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a competent E&s;tate; but his Reputation of Wi&s;dom, and In|tegrity,
gave him an Intere&s;t and Credit in that Country, much above his
Fortune; and no Man had more E&s;teem in it, or Power over it. He was
a Neighbour to the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> and in &s;o entire Friend&s;hip and Con|&s;idence
with him, that He had great Authority in the Society of all his
Friends, and Acquaintance. He was a Man of a great Sharpne&s;s of Un|der&s;tanding,
and of a piercing Judgment; no Man better under&s;tood the
<MILESTONE N="50">Affections and Temper of the Kingdom, or indeed the Nature of the Na|tion,
or di&s;cerned farther the Con&s;equence of Coun&s;els, and with what
Succe&s;s They were like to be attended. He was a very good <HI>Latin</HI> Scho|lar,
but his Ratiocination was above his Learning; and the Sharpne&s;s of his
<PB N="24" REF="31">
Wit incomparable: He was equal to the greate&s;t Tru&s;t and Employment,
if He had been ambitious of it, or &s;olicitous for it; but his Want of
Health produced a Kind of Lazine&s;s of Mind, which di&s;inclined him to
Bu&s;ine&s;s, and He died a little before the general Troubles of the Kingdom,
which He fore&s;aw with wonderful Concern, and when many wi&s;e Men
were weary of living &s;o long.</P>
<P>SIDNEY GODOLPHIN was a younger Brother of <HI>Godolphin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Mr.</HI> Sid|ney Godol|phin.</NOTE> but by the
Provi&s;ion left by his Father, and by the Death of a younger Brother, li|berally
&s;upplied for a very good Education, and for a chearful Sub&s;i&s;tence,
in any Cour&s;e of Life He propo&s;ed to him&s;elf. There was never &s;o great<MILESTONE N="10">
a Mind and Spirit contained in &s;o little Room; &s;o large an Under&s;tanding,
and &s;o unre&s;trained a Fancy, in &s;o very &s;mall a Body; &s;o that the Lord
<HI>Falkland</HI> u&s;ed to &s;ay merrily, that He thought it was a great Ingredient
into his Friend&s;hip for Mr. <HI>Godolphin,</HI> that He was plea&s;ed to be found in
his Company, where He was the properer Man; and it may be, the very
Remarkablene&s;s of his little Per&s;on, made the Sharpne&s;s of his Wit, and
the compo&s;ed Quickne&s;s of his Judgment and Under&s;tanding, the more
notable. He had &s;pent &s;ome Years in <HI>France,</HI> and in the low Countries;
and accompanied the Earl of <HI>Leice&s;ter</HI> in his Amba&s;&s;age into <HI>Denmark,</HI> be|fore
He re&s;olved to be quiet, and attend &s;ome Promotion in the Court;<MILESTONE N="20">
where his excellent Di&s;po&s;ition and Manners, and extraordinary Qualifica|tions,
made him very acceptable. Though every Body loved his Com|pany
very well, yet He loved very much to be alone, being in his Con&s;ti|tution
inclined &s;omewhat to Melancholy, and to Retirement among&s;t his
Books; and was &s;o far from being active, that He was contented to be re|proached
by his Friends with Lazine&s;s; and was of &s;o nice and tender a
Compo&s;ition, that a little Rain or Wind would di&s;order him, and divert
him from any &s;hort Journey, He had mo&s;t willingly propo&s;ed to him&s;elf;
in&s;omuch, as when He rid abroad with tho&s;e in who&s;e Company He mo&s;t
delighted, if the Wind chanced to be in his Face, he would (after a little<MILESTONE N="30">
plea&s;ant murmuring) &s;uddenly turn his Hor&s;e, and go Home: Yet the Ci|vil
War no &s;ooner began (the fir&s;t Approaches towards which He di&s;|covered
as &s;oon as any Man, by the Proceedings in Parliament, where He
was a Member, and oppo&s;ed with great Indignation) than He put him&s;elf
into the fir&s;t Troops which were rai&s;ed in the We&s;t for the King; and
bore the Unea&s;ine&s;s and Fatigue of Winter Marches, with an exemplar
Courage and Alacrity; until by too brave a Pur&s;uit of the Enemy, into an
ob&s;cure Village in <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> He was &s;hot with a Mu&s;ket; with which
(without &s;aying any Word more, than, Oh God, I am hurt) He fell dead
from his Hor&s;e; to the exce&s;&s;ive Grief of his Friends, who were all that<MILESTONE N="40">
knew him; and the irreparable Damage of the Public.</P>
<P>EDMUND WALLER was born to a very fair E&s;tate,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Mr.</HI> Ed|mund Waller.</NOTE> by the Par&s;imony, or
Frugality, of a wi&s;e Father and Mother; and He thought it &s;o com|mendable
an Advantage, that He re&s;olved to improve it with his utmo&s;t
Care, upon which in his Nature He was too much intent; and in Order
to that, He was &s;o much re&s;erved and retired, that He was &s;carce ever
heard of, till by his Addre&s;s and Dexterity He had gotten a very rich
Wife in the City, again&s;t all the Recommendation, and Countenance, and
Authority of the Court, which was thoroughly engaged on the Behalf of
Mr. <HI>Crofts;</HI> and which u&s;ed to be &s;ucce&s;sful in that Age, again&s;t any Op|po&s;ition.<MILESTONE N="50">
He had the good Fortune to have an Alliance and Friend&s;hip
with Dr. <HI>Morley,</HI> who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and in&s;tructed him in the reading many
good Books, to which his natural Parts and Promptitude inclined him,

e&s;pecially the Poets; and at the Age when other Men u&s;ed to give over
writing Ver&s;es (for He was near thirty Years of Age, when He fir&s;t en|gaged
him&s;elf in that Exerci&s;e, at lea&s;t, that He was known to do &s;o)
He &s;urprized the Town with two or three Pieces of that Kind; as if a
tenth Mu&s;e had been newly born, to cheri&s;h drooping Poetry. The Doctor
at that Time brought him into that Company, which was mo&s;t cele|brated
for good Conver&s;ation; where He was received, and e&s;teemed, with
great Applau&s;e, and Re&s;pect. He was a very plea&s;ant Di&s;cour&s;er, in Ear|ne&s;t,
and in Je&s;t, and therefore very grateful to all Kind of Company,
<MILESTONE N="10">where He was not the le&s;s e&s;teemed for being very rich.</P>
<P>HE had been even nur&s;ed in Parliaments, where He &s;at when He was very
young; and &s;o when They were re&s;umed again (after a long Intermi&s;&s;ion)
He appeared in tho&s;e A&s;&s;emblies with great Advantage; having a graceful
Way of &s;peaking, and by thinking much upon &s;everal Arguments (which his
Temper and Complexion, that had much of Melancholic, inclined him to)
He &s;eemed often to &s;peak upon the &s;udden, when the Occa&s;ion had only
admini&s;tred the Opportunity of &s;aying, what He had thoroughly con&s;idered,
which gave a great Lu&s;tre to all He &s;aid; which yet was rather of Delight,
than Weight. There needs no more be &s;aid to extol the Excellence and
<MILESTONE N="20">Power of his Wit, and Plea&s;antne&s;s of his Conver&s;ation, than that it was of
Magnitude enough, to cover a World of very great Faults; that is, &s;o to
cover them, that They were not taken Notice of to his Reproach; <HI>viz.</HI> a
Narrowne&s;s in his Nature to the lowe&s;t Degree; an Abjectne&s;s, and Want

could be contented with; that it pre&s;erved and won his Life from tho&s;e,
who were mo&s;t re&s;olved to take it; and in an Occa&s;ion in which He ought
to have been ambitious to have lo&s;t it; and then pre&s;erved him again, from
the Reproach and Contempt that was due to him, for &s;o pre&s;erving it,
<MILESTONE N="30">and for vindicating it at &s;uch a Price; that it had Power to reconcile him

in his Behaviour, and Di&s;cour&s;e; in&s;omuch as He had the greater Ad|vantage
when He was known, by promi&s;ing &s;o little before He was known.
He was an excellent Poet, both in <HI>Latin, Greek,</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as appears
by many Pieces yet abroad; though He &s;uppre&s;&s;ed many more him&s;elf,
e&s;pecially of <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> incomparably good, out of an Au&s;terity to tho&s;e
Sallies of his Youth. He was very dear to the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> with whom
He &s;pent as much Time as He could make his own; and as that Lord
would impute the &s;peedy Progre&s;s He made in the <HI>Greek</HI> Tongue, to the<MILESTONE N="50">
Information, and A&s;&s;i&s;tance He had from Mr. <HI>Earles,</HI> &s;o Mr. <HI>Earles</HI> would
frequently profe&s;s, that He had got more u&s;eful Learning by his Conver|&s;ation
at <HI>Tew</HI> (the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI>'s Hou&s;e) than He had at <HI>Oxford.</HI> In the
<PB N="27" REF="34">
fir&s;t &s;ettling of the Prince his Family, He was made one of his Chap|lains;
and attended on him when He was forced to leave the Kingdom.
He was among&s;t the few excellent Men who never had, nor ever could
have an Enemy, but &s;uch a one, who was an Enemy to all Learning, and
Virtue, and therefore would never make him&s;elf known.</P>
<P>Mr. JOHN HALES had been <HI>Greek</HI> Profe&s;&s;or in the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Mr.</HI> Hales.</NOTE>
and had borne the greate&s;t Part of the Labour of that excellent Edition
and Impre&s;&s;ion of St. <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom's</HI> Works, &s;et out by Sir <HI>Harry Savile;</HI>
who was then Warden of <HI>Merton</HI> College, when the other was Fellow of
<MILESTONE N="10">that Hou&s;e. He was Chaplain in the Hou&s;e with Sir <HI>Dudley Carleton,</HI>
Amba&s;&s;ador at the <HI>Hague</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> at the Time when the Synod of
<HI>Dort</HI> was held, and &s;o had Liberty to be pre&s;ent at the Con&s;ultations in
that A&s;&s;embly; and hath left the be&s;t Memorial behind him, of the Ig|norance,
and Pa&s;&s;ion, and Animo&s;ity, and Inju&s;tice of that Convention;
of which He often made very plea&s;ant Relations; though at that Time
it received too much Countenance from <HI>England.</HI> Being a Per&s;on of the
greate&s;t Eminency for Learning, and other Abilities, from which He might
have promi&s;ed him&s;elf any Pre&s;erment in the Church, He withdrew him|&s;elf
from all Pur&s;uits of that Kind, into a private Fellow&s;hip in the Col|lege
<MILESTONE N="20">of <HI>Eton,</HI> where his Friend Sir <HI>Harry Savile</HI> was Provo&s;t; where He
lived among&s;t his Books, and the mo&s;t &s;eparated from the World of any
Man then living; though He was not in the lea&s;t Degree inclined to Me|lancholy,
but on the contrary, of a very open and plea&s;ant Conver&s;ation;
and therefore was very well plea&s;ed with the Re&s;ort of his Friends to him,
who were &s;uch as He had cho&s;en, and in who&s;e Company He delighted,
and for who&s;e &s;ake He would &s;ometimes, once in a Year, re&s;ort to <HI>London,</HI>
only to enjoy their chearful Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>HE would never take any Cure of Souls; and was &s;o great a Con|temner
of Money, that He was wont to &s;ay, that his Fellow&s;hip, and the
<MILESTONE N="30">Bur&s;ar's Place (which for the good of the College, He held many Years)
was worth him fifty Pounds a Year more than He could &s;pend; and yet,
be&s;ides his being very charitable to all poor People, even to Liberality;
He had made a greater, and better Collection of Books, than were to be
found in any other private Library that I have &s;een; as He had &s;ure read
more, and carried more about him, in his excellent Memory, than any
Man I ever knew, my Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> only excepted, who I think &s;ided
him. He had, whether from his natural Temper and Con&s;titution, or
from his long Retirement from all Crowds, or from his profound Judg|ment,
and di&s;cerning Spirit, contracted &s;ome Opinions, which were not
<MILESTONE N="40">received, nor by him publi&s;hed, except in private Di&s;cour&s;es; and then
rather upon Occa&s;ion of Di&s;pute, than of po&s;itive Opinion; and He
would often &s;ay, his Opinions He was &s;ure did Him no Harm, but He
was far from being confident, that They might not do others Harm, who
entertained them, and might entertain other Re&s;ults from them, than He
did; and therefore He was very re&s;erved in communicating what He
thought Him&s;elf in tho&s;e Points, in which He differed from what was re|ceived.</P>
<P>NOTHING troubled him more, than the Brawls which were grown
from Religion; and He therefore exceedingly dete&s;ted the Tyranny of the
Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> more for their impo&s;ing uncharitably upon the Con|&s;ciences
<MILESTONE N="50">of other Men, than for the Errors in their own Opinions; and
Would often &s;ay, that He would renounce the Religion of the Church of
<HI>England</HI> to-morrow, if it obliged him to believe that any other Chri&s;tians
<PB N="28" REF="35">
&s;hould be damned; and that nobody would conclude another Man to be
damned, who did not wi&s;h him &s;o. No Man more &s;trict and &s;evere to
him&s;elf; to other Men &s;o charitable as to their Opinions, that He thought
that other Men were more in Fault for their Carriage towards them, than
the Men them&s;elves were, who erred; and He thought that Pride, and
Pa&s;&s;ion, more than Con&s;cience, were the Cau&s;e of all Separation from
each others Communion; and He frequently &s;aid, that that only kept the
World from agreeing upon &s;uch a Liturgy, as might bring them into one
Communion; all doctrinal Points upon which Men differed in their Opi|nions,
being to have no Place in any Liturgy. Upon an occa&s;ional Di&s;|cour&s;e<MILESTONE N="10">
with a Friend, of the frequent, and uncharitable Reproaches of
Heretick, and Schi&s;matick, too lightly thrown at each other, among&s;t
Men who differ in their Judgment, He writ a little Di&s;cour&s;e of Schi&s;m,
contained in le&s;s than two Sheets of Paper; which being tran&s;mitted from
Friend to Friend in Writing, was at la&s;t, without any Malice, brought to
the View of the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> Dr. <HI>Laud,</HI> who was a very
rigid Surveyor of all Things which never &s;o little bordered upon Schi&s;m;
and thought the Church could not be too vigilant again&s;t, and jealous of
&s;uch Incur&s;ions.</P>
<P>HE &s;ent for Mr. <HI>Hales,</HI> whom, when They had both lived in the Uni|ver&s;ity<MILESTONE N="20">
of <HI>Oxford,</HI> He had known well; and told him, that He had in
Truth believed him to be long &s;ince dead; and chid him very kindly for
having never come to him, having been of his old Acquaintance; then
a&s;ked him, whether He had lately writ a &s;hort Di&s;cour&s;e of Schi&s;m,
and whether He was of that Opinion, which that Di&s;cour&s;e implied; He
told him, that He had, for the Satisfaction of a private Friend, (who was
not of his Mind) a Year or two before, writ &s;uch a &s;mall Tract, without
any Imagination that it would be communicated; and that He believed it
did not contain any Thing, that was not agreeable to the Judgment of the
Primitive Fathers; upon which, the Archbi&s;hop debated with him upon<MILESTONE N="30">
&s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions of <HI>Irenaeus,</HI> and the mo&s;t ancient Fathers; and con|cluded
with &s;aying, that the Time was very apt to &s;et new Doctrines on
Foot, of which the Wits of the Age were too &s;u&s;ceptible; and that there
could not be too much Care taken, to pre&s;erve the Peace and Unity of the
Church; and from thence a&s;ked him of his Condition, and whether He
wanted any Thing, and the other an&s;wering, that He had enough,
and wanted, or de&s;ired no Addition, &s;o di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him with great Courte&s;y;
and &s;hortly after &s;ent for him again, when there was a Prebendary of
<HI>Wind&s;or</HI> fallen, and told him, the King had given him the Preferment,
becau&s;e it lay &s;o convenient to his Fellow&s;hip of <HI>Eton;</HI> which (though in|deed<MILESTONE N="40">
the mo&s;t convenient Preferment that could be thought of for him)
the Archbi&s;hop could not without great Difficulty, per&s;uade him to ac|cept,
and He did accept it rather to plea&s;e Him, than Him&s;elf; becau&s;e He
really believed He had enough before. He was one of the lea&s;t Men in
the Kingdom, and one of the greate&s;t Scholars in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. CHILLINGWORTH was of a Stature little &s;uperior to Mr. <HI>Hales</HI> (and
it was an Age,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Mr.</HI> Chilling|worth.</NOTE> in which there were many great, and wonderful Men of
that Size) and a Man of &s;o great a Subtilty of Under&s;tanding, and &s;o rare
a Temper in Debate; that as it was impo&s;&s;ible to provoke Him into any
Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;o it was very difficult to keep a Man's &s;elf from being a little di&s;|compo&s;ed<MILESTONE N="50">
by his Sharpne&s;s, and Quickne&s;s of Argument, and In&s;tances,
in which He had a rare Facility, and a great Advantage over all the Men
I ever knew. He had &s;pent all his younger Time in Di&s;putation; and
<PB N="29" REF="36">
had arrived to &s;o great a Ma&s;tery, as He was inferior to no Man in tho&s;e
Skirmi&s;hes; but He had, with his notable Perfection in this Exerci&s;e,
contracted &s;uch an Irre&s;olution, and Habit of doubting, that by Degrees
He grew confident of nothing, and a Sceptick at lea&s;t, in the greate&s;t My&s;|teries
of Faith.</P>
<P>THIS made him from fir&s;t wavering in Religion, and indulging to
Scruples, to reconcile him&s;elf too &s;oon, and too ea&s;ily to the Church of
<HI>Rome;</HI> and carrying &s;till his own Inqui&s;itivene&s;s about him, without any
Re&s;ignation to their Authority (which is the only Temper can make that
<MILESTONE N="10">Church &s;ure of it's Pro&s;elytes) having made a Journey to <HI>St. Omers,</HI> purely to
perfect his Conver&s;ion, by the Conver&s;ation of tho&s;e, who had the greate&s;t
Name, He found as little Satisfaction there; and returned with as much
Ha&s;te from them; with a Belief that an entire Exemption from Error, was
neither inherent in, nor nece&s;&s;ary to any Church: which occa&s;ioned that
War, which was carried on by the Je&s;uits with &s;o great A&s;perity, and Re|proaches
again&s;t him, and in which He defended him&s;elf, by &s;uch an ad|mirable
Eloquence of Language, and clear, and incomparable Power of
Rea&s;on, that He not only made them appear unequal Adver&s;aries, but
carried the War into their own Quarters; and made the Pope's Infallibi|lity
<MILESTONE N="20">to be as much &s;haken, and declined by their own Doctors (and as
great an Acrimony among&s;t them&s;elves upon that Subject) and to be at
lea&s;t as much doubted, as in the Schools of the Reformed or Prote&s;tant;
and forced them &s;ince, to defend and maintain tho&s;e unhappy Contro|ver&s;ies
in Religion, with Arms and Weapons of another Nature, than were
u&s;ed, or known in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> when <HI>Bellarmine</HI> died; and which
probably will in Time undermine the very Foundation that &s;upports it.</P>
<P>SUCH a Levity, and Propen&s;ity to change, is commonly attended with
great Infirmities in, and no le&s;s Reproach, and Prejudice to the Per&s;on;
but the Sincerity of his Heart was &s;o con&s;picuous, and without the lea&s;t
<MILESTONE N="30">Temptation of any corrupt End; and the Innocence, and Candour in his
Nature &s;o evident, and without any Perver&s;ene&s;s; that all who knew him,
clearly di&s;cerned, that all tho&s;e re&s;tle&s;s Motions and Fluctuations, pro|ceeded
only from the Warmth, and Jealou&s;y of his own Thoughts, in a too
nice Inqui&s;ition for Truth. Neither the Books of the Adver&s;ary, nor any
of their Per&s;ons, though He was acquainted with the be&s;t of both, had ever
made great Impre&s;&s;ion upon him; all his Doubts grew out of him&s;elf,
when He a&s;&s;i&s;ted his Scruples with all the Strength of his own Rea&s;on, and
was then too hard for Him&s;elf; but finding as little Quiet and Repo&s;e in
tho&s;e Victories, He quickly recovered, by a new Appeal to his own Judg|ment;
<MILESTONE N="40">&s;o that He was in Truth, upon the Matter, in all his Sallies, and
Retreats, his own Convert; though He was not &s;o totally dive&s;ted of all
Thoughts of this World, but that when He was ready for it, He ad|mitted
&s;ome great and con&s;iderable Churchmen, to be Sharers with him
in his publick Conver&s;ion.</P>
<P>WHILST He was in Perplexity, or rather &s;ome pa&s;&s;ionate Di&s;inclina|tion
to the Religion He had been educated in, He had the Misfortune to
have much Acquaintance with one Mr. <HI>Lugar,</HI> a Mini&s;ter of that Church;
a Man of a Competency of Learning, in tho&s;e Points mo&s;t controverted
with the <HI>Romani&s;ts,</HI> but of no acute Parts of Wit, or Judgment; and
<MILESTONE N="50">wrought &s;o far upon him, by weakening, and enervating tho&s;e Arguments,
by which He found He was governed (as He had all the Logick, and all the
Rhetorick, that was nece&s;&s;ary to per&s;uade very powerfully Men of the
greate&s;t Talents) that the poor Man, not able to live long in Doubt, too
<PB N="30" REF="37">
ha&s;tily de&s;erted his own Church, and betook him&s;elf to the <HI>Roman:</HI> nor
could all the Arguments, and Rea&s;ons of Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI> make him
pau&s;e in the Expedition He was u&s;ing; or reduce him from that Church
after He had given him&s;elf to it; but He had always a great Animo&s;ity
again&s;t him, for having (as He &s;aid) unkindly betrayed him, and carried
him into another Religion, and there left him. So unfit are &s;ome Con&s;ti|tutions
to be troubled with Doubts, after They are once fixed.</P>
<P>HE did really believe all War to be unlawful; and did not think that
the Parliament (who&s;e Proceedings He perfectly abhorted) did in Truth
intend to involve the Nation in a Civil War, till after the Battle of <HI>Edge|hill;</HI><MILESTONE N="10">
and then He thought any Expedient, or Stratagem that was like to
put a &s;peedy End to it, to be the mo&s;t commendable: and &s;o having too
mathematically conceived an Engine, that &s;hould move &s;o lightly, as to
be a Brea&s;t-work in all Encounters, and A&s;&s;aults in the Field; He car|ried
it, to make the Experiment, into that Part of his Maje&s;ty's Army,
which was only in that Winter Sea&s;on in the Field, under the Command
of the Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> in <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> upon the Borders of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex;</HI> where
He was &s;hut up in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Arundel;</HI> which was forced, after a &s;hort,
&s;harp Siege, to yield for want of Victual; and poor Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI>
with it, falling into the Rebels Hands; and being mo&s;t barbarou&s;ly treated<MILESTONE N="20">
by them, e&s;pecially by that Clergy which followed them; and being
broken with Sickne&s;s, contracted by the ill Accommodation, and Want
of Meat, and Fire during the Siege, which was in a terrible Sea&s;on of
Fro&s;t and Snow, He died &s;hortly after in Pri&s;on. He was a Man of ex|cellent
Parts, and of a chearful Di&s;po&s;ition; void of all Kind of Vice,
and endued with many notable Virtues; of a very publick Heart, and an
indefatigable De&s;ire to do Good; his only Unhappine&s;s proceeded from his
&s;leeping too little, and thinking too much; which &s;ometimes threw him
into violent Fevers</P>
<P>THIS was Mr. HYDE's Company, and Conver&s;ation, to which He<MILESTONE N="30">
dedicated his vacant Times, and all that Time which He could make vacant,
from the Bu&s;ine&s;s of his Profe&s;&s;ion; which He indulged with no more
Pa&s;&s;ion than was nece&s;&s;ary to keep up the Reputation of a Man, that had
no Purpo&s;e to be idle; which indeed He perfectly abhorred: and He took
always Occa&s;ion to celebrate the Time He had &s;pent in that Conver&s;ation,
with great Satisfaction, and Delight. Nor was He le&s;s fortunate, in the
acquaintance and Friend&s;hips which He made with the Per&s;ons in his Pro|fe&s;&s;ion;
who were all eminent Men, or of the mo&s;t hopeful Parts; who
being all much &s;uperior to him in Age, and Experience, and entirely de|voted
to their Profe&s;&s;ion, were yet well plea&s;ed with the Gaiety of his<MILESTONE N="40">
Humour, and inoffen&s;ive, and, winning Behaviour; and this good Incli|nation
of theirs was improved by the Intere&s;t They &s;aw He had in Per|&s;ons
of the be&s;t Quality, to whom He was very acceptable, and his Con|dition
of living, which was with more Expen&s;e than young Lawyers were
accu&s;tomed to.</P>
<P>THOSE Per&s;ons were,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Hyde's <HI>Friends in his Profe&s;&s;ion.</HI></NOTE> Mr. <HI>Lane,</HI> who was then Attorney to the Prin&cacute;e

Whitlock;</HI> all Men of eminent Parts, and great Learning out of their Pro|fe&s;&s;ions;
and in their Profe&s;&s;ions, of &s;ignal Reputation; and though the
two la&s;t did afterwards bow their Knees to <HI>Baal,</HI> and &s;o &s;werved from
<PB N="31" REF="38">
their Allegiance, it was with le&s;s Rancour and Malice than other Men;
They never led, but followed; and were rather carried away with the Tor|rent,
than &s;wam with the Stream; and failed through tho&s;e Infirmities,
which le&s;s than a general Defection, and a pro&s;perous Rebellion could ne|ver
have di&s;covered. With the&s;e, and very few other Per&s;ons of other So|cieties,
and of more than ordinary Parts in the Profe&s;&s;ion, He conver&s;ed.
In Bu&s;ine&s;s, and in Practice, with the re&s;t of the Profe&s;&s;ion He had at
mo&s;t a formal Acquaintance, and little Familiarity; very &s;eldom u&s;ing,
when his Practice was at highe&s;t, &s;o much as to eat in the Hall, without
<MILESTONE N="10">which, no Man ever got the Reputation of a good Student; but He ever
gave his Time of eating to his Friends; and was wont plea&s;antly to &s;ay,
&startq;that He repaired him&s;elf with very good Company at Dinner, for the
ill Company He had kept in the Morning;&endq; and made him&s;elf amends
for the Time He lo&s;t with his Friends, by declining Suppers; and with a
Part of that Time which was allowed for Sleep; but He grew every Day
more intent on Bu&s;ine&s;s, and more engaged in Practice, &s;o that He could
not a&s;&s;ign &s;o much Time as He had u&s;ed to do, to his beloved Conver|&s;ation.</P>
<P>THE Countenance He received from the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI>
who took all Occa&s;ion to mention him as a Per&s;on He had Kindne&s;s for;
<MILESTONE N="20">the Favour of the Lord <HI>Coventry,</HI> manife&s;ted as often as He came before
him; the Reception He found with the Lord Privy Seal, the Earl of <HI>Man|che&s;ter,</HI>
who had rai&s;ed the Court of Reque&s;ts to as much Bu&s;ine&s;s as the
Chancery it&s;elf was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, and where He was looked upon as a Fa|vourite;
the Familiarity u&s;ed towards him by the Lord <HI>Pembroke,</HI> who
was Lord Chamberlain of the King's Hou&s;e, and a greater Man in the
Country than the Court; by the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> and many other Lords
and Ladies, and other Per&s;ons of Intere&s;t in the Court, made him looked
upon by the Judges in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall,</HI> with much Conde&s;cen&s;ion; and
They, who before He put on his Gown, looked upon him as one who
<MILESTONE N="30">de&s;igned &s;ome other Cour&s;e of Life (for though He had been always very
punctual in the Performance of all tho&s;e publick Exerci&s;es the Profe&s;&s;ion
obliged him to, both before, and after He was called to the Bar; yet in
all other Re&s;pects He &s;eemed not to confine him&s;elf wholly to that Cour&s;e
of Life) now when They no &s;ooner &s;aw him put on his Gown, but that
He was &s;uddenly in Practice, and taken Notice of particularly in all Courts

He de&s;ired in that Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>AS He had tho&s;e many Friends in Court, &s;o He was not le&s;s acceptable
to many great Per&s;ons in the Country, who lea&s;t regarded the Court, and
<MILESTONE N="40">were lea&s;t e&s;teemed by it; and He had that rare Felicity, that even They,
who did not love many of tho&s;e, upon whom He mo&s;t depended, were
yet very well plea&s;ed with him, and with his Company. The Earl of
<HI>Hertford,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> who&s;e Intere&s;ts, and Friend&s;hips were
then the &s;ame; and who were looked upon with Reverence by all who
had not Reverence for the Court; and even by all in the Court, who were
not &s;atisfied there (which was, and always will be a great People) were
very kind to him, and ready to tru&s;t him in any Thing that was mo&s;t &s;e|cret;
and though He could not di&s;po&s;e the Archbi&s;hop, or the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>
to any Corre&s;pondence, or good Intelligence with each other; which He
<MILESTONE N="50">exceedingly laboured to do, and found an equal Aver&s;ion in both towards
each other;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Hyde <HI>re|conciles the Archbi&s;hop, and the Earl of</HI> Hertford.</NOTE> yet He &s;ucceeded to his Wi&s;h in bringing the Archbi&s;hop, and

Grace, as the Cau&s;e of all that was ami&s;s.&endq; He replied, &startq;that He was
&s;orry for it; He knew He did not de&s;erve it; and that He mu&s;t not
give over &s;erving the King, and the Church, to plea&s;e the People, who
otherwi&s;e would not &s;peak well of him.&endq; Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> told him, &startq;He
thought He need not le&s;&s;en his Zeal for either; and that it grieved him
to find Per&s;ons of the be&s;t Condition, and who loved both King, and
Church, exceedingly indevoted to Him; complaining of his Manner of
treating them, when They had Occa&s;ion to re&s;ort to him, it may be,
for his Directions.&endq; And then named him two Per&s;ons of the mo&s;t In|tere&s;t
and Credit in <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> who had that Summer attended the Coun|cil<MILESTONE N="30">
Board, in &s;ome Affairs which concerned the King, and the County;
that all the Lords pre&s;ent u&s;ed them with great Courte&s;y, knowing well
their Quality, and Reputation; but that He alone &s;pake very &s;harply to
them, and without any Thing of Grace, at which They were much trou|bled;
and one of them, &s;uppo&s;ing that &s;omebody had done him ill Offices,
went the next Morning to <HI>Lambeth,</HI> to pre&s;ent his Service to him, and to
di&s;cover, if He could, what Mi&s;repre&s;entation had been made of him:
that after He had attended very long, He was admitted to &s;peak with his
Grace, who &s;carce hearing him, &s;harply an&s;wered him, that &startq;He had no
Lei&s;ure for Compliments;&endq; and &s;o hurried away; which put the other<MILESTONE N="40">
Gentleman much out of Countenance: And that this Kind of Behaviour
of his was the Di&s;cour&s;e of all Companies of Per&s;ons of Quality; every Man
continuing any &s;uch Story with another like it, very much to his Di&s;ad|vantage;
and to the Trouble of tho&s;e who were very ju&s;t to him.</P>
<P>HE heard the Relation very patiently,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Arch|bi&s;hop's Re|ply.</NOTE> and attentively; and di&s;cour&s;ed
over every Particular with all imaginable Conde&s;cen&s;ion; and &s;aid, with
evident Shew of Trouble, that &startq;He was very unfortunate to be &s;o ill un|der&s;tood;
that He meant very well; that He remembered the Time,
when tho&s;e two Per&s;ons were with the Council; than upon any Delibe|rations,
when any Thing was re&s;olved, or to be &s;aid to any body, the<MILESTONE N="50">
Council enjoined him to deliver their Re&s;olutions; which He did al|ways
according to the be&s;t of his Under&s;tanding; but by the Imper|fection
He had by Nature, which He &s;aid often troubled him, He might
<PB N="33" REF="40">
deliver it in &s;uch a Tune, and with a Sharpne&s;s of Voice, that made
Men believe He was angry, when there was no &s;uch Thing; that when
tho&s;e Gentlemen were there, and He had delivered what He was to &s;ay,
They made &s;ome Stay, and &s;pake with &s;ome of the Lords, which not
being according to Order, He thought He gave them &s;ome Reprehen|&s;ion;
They having at that Time very much other Bu&s;ine&s;s to do: that
He did well remember, that one of them (who was a Per&s;on of Honour)
came afterwards to him, at a Time He was &s;hut up about an Affair of
Importance, which required his full Thoughts; but that as &s;oon as He
<MILESTONE N="10">heard of the other's being without, He &s;ent for him, him&s;elf going into
the next Room, and received him very kindly, as He thought; and &s;up|po&s;ing
that He came about Bu&s;ine&s;s, a&s;ked him what his Bu&s;ine&s;s was,
and the other an&s;wering, that He had no Bu&s;ine&s;s, but continuing his
Addre&s;s with &s;ome Ceremony, He had indeed &s;aid, that He had not
Time for Compliments; but He did not think that He went out of the
Room in that Manner: and concluded, that it was not po&s;&s;ible for him
in the many Occupations He had, to &s;pend any Time in unnece&s;&s;ary
Compliments; and that if his Integrity and Uprightne&s;s, which never
&s;hould be liable to Reproach, could not be &s;trong enough to pre&s;erve
<MILESTONE N="20">him, He mu&s;t &s;ubmit to God's Plea&s;ure.&endq;</P>
<P>HE was well contented to hear Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> reply very freely upon the
Subject, who &s;aid, &startq;He ob&s;erved by what his Grace him&s;elf had related,
that the Gentlemen had too much Rea&s;on for the Report They made;
and He did not wonder that They had been much troubled at his Car|riage
towards them; that He did exceedingly wi&s;h, that He would more
re&s;erve his Pa&s;&s;ion towards all Per&s;ons, how faulty &s;oever; and that He
would treat Per&s;ons of Honour, and Quality, and Intere&s;t in their Coun|try,
with more Courte&s;y, and Conde&s;cen&s;ion; e&s;pecially when They came
to vi&s;it him, and make Offer of their Service.&endq; He &s;aid, &s;miling, that
<MILESTONE N="30">&startq;He could only undertake for his Heart; that He had very good Mean|ing;
for his Tongue, He could not undertake, that He would not &s;ome|times
&s;peak more ha&s;tily, and &s;harply, than He &s;hould do, (which
oftentimes He was &s;orry, and reprehended him&s;elf for) and in a Tune
which might be liable to Mi&s;interpretation, with them, who were
not very well acquainted with him, and &s;o knew, that it was an In|firmity,
which his Nature, and Education had &s;o rooted in him,
that it was in vain to contend with it.&endq; For the State, and Di&s;tance
He kept with Men, He &s;aid, &startq;He thought it was not more than was
&s;uitable to the Place and Degree He held in the Church, and State;
<MILESTONE N="40">or &s;o much as others had a&s;&s;umed to them&s;elves, who had &s;at in his
Place; and thereupon He told him &s;ome Behaviour and Carriage of his
Predece&s;&s;or <HI>Abbot</HI> (who He &s;aid was not better born than him&s;elf) to|wards
the greate&s;t Nobility of the Kingdom, which He thought was
very in&s;olent, and inexcu&s;able;&endq; and was indeed very ridiculous.</P>
<P>AFTER this free Di&s;cour&s;e, Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> ever found him&s;elf more graciou&s;ly
received by him, and treated with more Familiarity; upon which He al|ways
concluded, that if the Archbi&s;hop had had any true Friend, who
would, in proper Sea&s;ons, have dealt frankly with him, in the mo&s;t im|portant
Matters, and wherein the Errors were like to be mo&s;t penal, He
<MILESTONE N="50">would not only have received it very well, but have profited him&s;elf by it.
But it is the Misfortune of mo&s;t Per&s;ons of that Education (how worthy
&s;oever) that They have rarely Friend&s;hips with Men above their own Con|dition;
and that their A&s;cent being commonly &s;udden, from low to high,
<PB N="34" REF="41">
They have afterwards rather Dependants than Friends; and are &s;till de|ceived,
by keeping &s;omewhat in Re&s;erve to them&s;elves, even from tho&s;e
with whom They &s;eem mo&s;t openly to communicate; and which is wor&s;e,
receive for the mo&s;t Part, their Informations and Adverti&s;ements from
Clergymen, who under&s;tand the lea&s;t, and take the wor&s;t Mea&s;ure of hu|man
Affairs, of all Mankind, that can write, and read.</P>
<P>UNDER this univer&s;al Acquaintance, and general Acceptation, Mr.
<HI>Hyde</HI> led, for many Years, as chearful, and plea&s;ant a Life, as any Man
did enjoy, as long as the Kingdom took any Plea&s;ure in it&s;elf. His Prac|tice
grew every Day as much as He wi&s;hed; and would have been much<MILESTONE N="10">
more, if He had wi&s;hed it; by which, He not only &s;upported his Ex|pen&s;e,
greater much than Men of his Rank, and Pretences, u&s;ed to make,
but encrea&s;ed his E&s;tate by &s;ome convenient Purcha&s;es of Land, adjoin|ing
to his other; and He grew &s;o much in Love with Bu&s;ine&s;s and Prac|tice,
that He gave up his whole Heart to it; re&s;olving, by a Cour&s;e of &s;e|vere
Study, to recover the Time He had lo&s;t upon le&s;s profitable Learn|ing;
and to intend nothing el&s;e, but to reap all tho&s;e Benefits, to which
that Profe&s;&s;ion could carry him, and to the pur&s;uing whereof, He had &s;o
many, and &s;o unu&s;ual Encouragements; and towards which it was not the
lea&s;t, that God had ble&s;&s;ed him with an excellent Wife, who perfectly<MILESTONE N="20">
re&s;igned her&s;elf to him; and who then had brought him, before any Trou|bles
in the Kingdom, three Sons, and a Daughter, which He then, and
ever, looked upon as his greate&s;t Ble&s;&s;ing, and Con&s;olation.</P>
<P>BECAUSE we &s;hall have little Cau&s;e hereafter to mention any other
Particulars,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Hyde's <HI>Reflections on the younger Part of his Life.</HI></NOTE> in the calm Part of his Life, whil&s;t He followed the Study
and Practice of the Law, it will not in this Place appear a very imper|tinent
Digre&s;&s;ion to &s;ay, that He was, in that very Time, when Fortune
&s;eemed to &s;mile, and to intend well towards him, and often afterwards,
throughout the whole Cour&s;e of his Life, wont to &s;ay, that &startq;when He
reflected upon him&s;elf, and his pa&s;t Actions, even from the Time of<MILESTONE N="30">
his fir&s;t coming to the <HI>Middle Temple,</HI> He had much more Cau&s;e to be
terrified upon the Reflection, than the Man had, who viewed <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI>
Bridge in the Morning that it was broken, and which He had galloped
over in the Night; that He had pa&s;&s;ed over more Precipices than the
other had done, for many Nights, and Days, and &s;ome Years together;
from which, nothing but the immediate Hand of God, could have pre|&s;erved
him.&endq; For though it is very true, the Per&s;ons before mentioned
were the only Men, in who&s;e Company, in tho&s;e Sea&s;ons of his Life, He
took Delight; yet He frequently found him&s;elf in the Conver&s;ation of
wor&s;e, and indeed of all Manner of Men; and it being in the Time when<MILESTONE N="40">
the War was entered into again&s;t the two Crowns; and the Expeditions
made to, and unpro&s;perous returns from <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and the I&s;le of <HI>Ree,</HI> the
Town was full of Soldiers, and of young Gentlemen who intended to be
Soldiers, or as like them as They could; great Licen&s;e u&s;ed of all Kinds,
in Cloaths, in Diet, in Gaming; and all Kind of Expen&s;es equally carried
on, by Men who had Fortunes of their own to &s;upport it, and by others,
who having nothing of their own, cared not what They &s;pent, whil&s;t They
could find Credit; &s;o that there was never an Age, in which in &s;o &s;hort
a Time, &s;o many young Gentlemen, who had not Experience in the
World, or &s;ome good tutelar Angel to protect them, were in&s;en&s;ibly, and<MILESTONE N="50">
&s;uddenly overwhelmed in that Sea of Wine, and Women, and Quarrels, and
Gaming, which almo&s;t over&s;pread the whole Kingdom, and the Nobility,
and Gentry thereof. And when He had by God's immediate Ble&s;&s;ing, di&s;|entangled
<PB N="35" REF="42">
him&s;elf from the&s;e Labyrinths (his Nature and Inclination di&s;|po&s;ing
him rather to pa&s;s through tho&s;e di&s;&s;olute Quarters, than to make
any Stay in them) and was enough compo&s;ed again&s;t any extravagant
Excur&s;ions; He was &s;till conver&s;ant with a Rank of Men (how worthy
&s;oever) above his Quality; and engaged in an Expen&s;e above his For|tune,
if the extraordinary Accidents of his Life, had not &s;upplied him
for tho&s;e Exce&s;&s;es; &s;o that it brought no Prejudice upon him, except in the
Cen&s;ure of &s;evere Men, who thought him a Per&s;on of more Licen&s;e than in
Truth He was; and who in a &s;hort Time, were very fully reconciled to him.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10">HE had without Doubt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And his own Character.</NOTE> great Infirmities; which by a providential
Mercy were &s;ea&s;onably re&s;trained from growing into Vices, at lea&s;t into
any that were habitual. He had Ambition enough to keep him from
being &s;atisfied with his own Condition, and to rai&s;e his Spirit to great De|&s;igns
of rai&s;ing him&s;elf; but not to tran&s;port him to endeavour it by any
crooked, and indirect Means. He was never &s;u&s;pected to flatter the great|e&s;t
Man; or in the lea&s;t Degree to di&s;&s;emble his own Opinions, or Thoughts,
how ingrateful &s;oever it often proved; and even an affected Defect in, and
Contempt of tho&s;e two u&s;eful Qualities co&s;t him dear afterwards. He in|dulged
his Palate very much, and took even &s;ome Delight in eating and
<MILESTONE N="20">drinking well; but without any Approach to Luxury; and, in Truth,
rather di&s;cour&s;ed like an Epicure, than was one; having &s;pent much Time
in the eating Hours, with the Earl of <HI>Dor&s;et,</HI> the Lord <HI>Conway,</HI> and the
Lord <HI>Lumley,</HI> Men who excelled in gratifying their Appetites. He had
a Fancy &s;harp, and luxuriant; but &s;o carefully cultivated, and &s;trictly
guarded, that He never was heard to &s;peak a loo&s;e, or a profane Word;
which He imputed to the Cha&s;tity of the Per&s;ons, where his Conver&s;a|tion
u&s;ually was; where that rank Sort of Wit was religiou&s;ly dete&s;ted;
and a little Di&s;countenance would quickly root tho&s;e un&s;avoury Weeds
out of all Di&s;cour&s;es where Per&s;ons of Honour are pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30">HE was in his Nature inclined to Pride and Pa&s;&s;ion; and to a Hu|mour
between Wrangling, and Di&s;puting, very trouble&s;ome; which good
Company in a &s;hort Time, &s;o much reformed, and ma&s;tered, that no Man
was more affable and courteous to all Kind of Per&s;ons; and They who
knew the great Infirmity of his whole Family, which abounded in Pa&s;|&s;ion,
u&s;ed to &s;ay, He had much extingui&s;hed the Unruline&s;s of that Fire.
That which &s;upported, and rendered him generally acceptable, was his
Genero&s;ity (for He had too much a Contempt of Money) and the Opi|nion
Men had of the Goodne&s;s, and Ju&s;tice of his Nature which was
tran&s;cendent in him, in a wonderful Tenderne&s;s, and Delight in obliging.
<MILESTONE N="40">His Integrity was ever without Blemi&s;h; and believed to be above Temp|tation.
He was firm and un&s;haken in his Friend&s;hips: and though He
had great Candour towards others in the Differences of Religion, He was
zealou&s;ly, and deliberately fixed in the Principles both of the Doctrine, and
Di&s;cipline of the Church: yet He u&s;ed to &s;ay to his neare&s;t Friends, in
that Time, when He expected another Kind of Calm for the Remainder
of his Life, &startq;though He had &s;ome glimmering Light of, and Inclination
to Virtue in his Nature, that the whole Progre&s;s of his Life had been
full of de&s;perate Hazards; and that only the merciful Hand of God Al|mighty
had prevented his being both an unfortunate, and a vicious Man:&endq;
<MILESTONE N="50">and He &s;till &s;aid, that &startq;God had vouch&s;afed that &s;ignal Goodne&s;s to him,
for the Piety, and exemplar Virtue of his Father, and Mother;&endq; who&s;e
Memory He had always in Veneration; and He was plea&s;ed with what
his neare&s;t Ally, and Bo&s;om Friend Serjeant <HI>Hyde</HI> (who was afterwards
<PB N="36" REF="43">
Chief Ju&s;tice of the King's Bench) u&s;ed at that Time to &s;ay of him, that
his Cou&s;in had pa&s;&s;ed his Time very luckily; and with notable Succe&s;s;
and was like to be very happy in the World; but He would never advi&s;e
any of his Friends to walk in the &s;ame Paths, or to tread in his Steps.</P>
<P>IT was about the Year 1639,<NOTE PLACE="marg">General State of <HI>Europe.</HI> A. D. 1639.</NOTE> when He was little more than thirty
Years of Age; and when <HI>England</HI> enjoyed the greate&s;t Mea&s;ure of Feli|city,
that it had ever known; the two Crowns of <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> wor|rying
each other, by their mutual Incur&s;ions, and Inva&s;ions; whil&s;t They
had both a Civil War in their own Bowels; the former, by frequent Re|bellions
from their own Factions, and Animo&s;ities; the latter, by the De|fection<MILESTONE N="10">
of <HI>Portugal;</HI> and both laboured more to ran&s;ack, and burn each
other's Dominions, than to extingui&s;h their own Fire. All <HI>Germany</HI>
welt'ring in it's own Blood; and contributing to each other's De&s;truction,

to &s;ee &s;uch De&s;olation wrought by the Pride, and Pa&s;&s;ion, and

<P>UPON the Rebellion in <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the Year 1640, the King called a
Parliament; which met according to Summons, upon the 3d of <HI>April.</HI>
Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> was cho&s;en to &s;erve for two Places;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> cho&s;en Mem+ber for <HI>Wot|ton Ba&s;&s;et.</HI></NOTE> for the Borough of <HI>Wotton|Ba&s;&s;et</HI><MILESTONE N="50">
in the County of <HI>Wilts;</HI> and for the Borough of <HI>Shafte&s;bury,</HI> in the

for <HI>Shafte&s;bury.</HI></P>
<P>THE next Day after Mr. <HI>Pym</HI> had recapitulated the whole Series
of the Grievances, and Mi&s;carriages, which had been in the State;
Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> told the Hou&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His fir&s;t Speech in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons.</NOTE> that &startq;that worthy Gentleman had omitted
one Grievance, more heavy than (as He thought) many of the others;
which was, the Earl Mar&s;hal's Court: a Court newly erected, without
Colour, or Shadow of Law, which took upon it to fine, and impri&s;on
the King's Subjects; and to give great Damages for Matters which the
<MILESTONE N="10">Law gave no Damages for.&endq; He repeated a plea&s;ant Story of a Citizen,
who being rudely treated, for more than his Fare came to, by a Water|man,
who pre&s;&s;ing him, &s;till &s;hewed his Cre&s;t, or Badge upon his Coat,
the Citizen bad him begone <HI>with his Goo&s;e;</HI> whereas it was in Truth, a
Swan, the Cre&s;t of an Earl, who&s;e Servant the Waterman was; where|upon
the Citizen was called into the Mar&s;hal's Court, and after a long, and
chargeable Attendance, was, <HI>for the opprobrious di&s;honouring the Earl's
Cre&s;t, by calling the Swan a Goo&s;e,</HI> fined, and impri&s;oned, till He had paid
con&s;iderable Damages to the Lord, or at lea&s;t to the Waterman; which
really undid the Citizen.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20">HE told them another Story as ridiculous, of a Gentleman, who owing
his Taylor a long Time, a good Sum of Money for Cloaths, and his Tay|lor
coming one Day to his Chamber, with more than ordinary Impor|tunity
for his Debt, and not receiving any good An&s;wer, threatened to
arre&s;t him; upon which the Gentleman enraged, gave him very ill Words,
called him ba&s;e Fellow, and laid his Hands upon him, to thru&s;t him out
of his Chamber; in this Struggle, and under this Provocation, Oppre&s;&s;ion,
and Reproach, the poor Taylor chanced to &s;ay, that He was as good a
Man as the other; for which Words He was called into the Mar&s;hal's
Court; and for his Peace, was content to be &s;atisfied his Debt, out of his
<MILESTONE N="30">own ill Manners; being compelled to relea&s;e all his other Demands in
Lieu of Damages. The Ca&s;e was known by many, and dete&s;ted by all.</P>
<P>HE told them, that &startq;there was an Appendant to that Court, which
He called the Pageantry of it, the Heralds, who were as grievous to
the Gentry, as the Court was to the People. He &s;aid, that &s;ure the
Knights of that Hou&s;e, when They received that Honour from the
King, though They might think them&s;elves obliged to live at a higher
Rate, yet They believed, that They might die as good cheap as other
Men; He told them They could not, it would co&s;t them ten Pounds
more; and yet a Gentleman could not die for nothing.&endq; The Heralds
<MILESTONE N="40">had procured &s;uch an Order from the Earl Mar&s;hal, to force all Per&s;ons
to pay at their Funerals, &s;uch &s;everal Sums, according to their &s;everal De|grees.
He concluded with a De&s;ire, that when the Wi&s;dom of that Hou&s;e
provided Remedies again&s;t the other Grievances, it would likewi&s;e &s;ecure
the Subject again&s;t this Exorbitance. This Repre&s;entation was very ac|ceptable
to the Hou&s;e, both in Re&s;pect of the Matter, which was odious
enough; and in Regard of the Per&s;on that u&s;urped that mon&s;trous Ju|ri&s;diction,
who was in no Degree grateful to them; upon whom He that
made the Motion, had not made the lea&s;t Reflection. The Mode&s;ty of that
Time not permitting the Mention of great Men, with any Reproach, un|til
<MILESTONE N="50">their Offences were fir&s;t examined, and proved; and this being the

<P>UPON the warm Debate in the Hou&s;e of Commons, concerning the
<PB N="38" REF="45">
giving the King Money, Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> ob&s;erved by the &s;everal Di&s;cour&s;es
of many of the Court, who were of near Admi&s;&s;ion to the King,
and Queen, and like to make probable Gue&s;&s;es, that They believed, the
King would be &s;o much di&s;plea&s;ed at the Proceedings of the Hou&s;e, that
He would di&s;&s;olve them; which He believed would prove the mo&s;t fatal
Re&s;olution could be taken. As &s;oon as the Hou&s;e was up, He went over
to <HI>Lambeth,</HI> to the Archbi&s;hop; whom He found walking in his Garden,
having received a full Account of all that had pa&s;&s;ed, from Per&s;ons who
had made more Ha&s;te from the Hou&s;e. He appeared &s;ad, and full of
Thoughts; and calling the other to him, &s;eemed willing to hear what He<MILESTONE N="10">
would &s;ay. He told him, &startq;that He would not trouble him with the Re|lation
of any Thing that had pa&s;&s;ed, of which He pre&s;umed He had re|ceived
a good Account; that his Bu&s;ine&s;s was only to inform him of his
own Fears and Apprehen&s;ions; and the Ob&s;ervation He had made
upon the Di&s;cour&s;es of &s;ome con&s;iderable Men of the Court; as if the
King might be wrought upon, becau&s;e there had not been that Expe|dition
u&s;ed as He expected, &s;peedily to di&s;&s;olve the Parliament. That
He came only to be&s;eech him to u&s;e all his Credit, to prevent &s;uch a de&s;|perate
Coun&s;el; which would produce great Mi&s;chief to the King, and
to the Church: that He was confident the Hou&s;e was as well con&s;tituted<MILESTONE N="20">
and di&s;po&s;ed, as ever Hou&s;e of Commons was, or would be: that the Num|ber
of the di&s;affected to Church, or State, was very &s;mall; and though
They might ob&s;truct for &s;ome Time the quick re&s;olving upon what was
fit, They would never be able to pervert their good Inclinations, and
De&s;ires to &s;erve the King.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Archbi&s;hop heard him very patiently, and &s;aid, He believed the
King would be very angry at the Way of their Proceedings; for that in
this Conjuncture, the delaying, and denying to do what He de&s;ired, was
the &s;ame Thing; and therefore He believed it probable that He would
di&s;&s;olve them; without which He could not enter upon other Coun&s;els.<MILESTONE N="30">
that for his own Part, He was re&s;olved to deliver no Opinion; but as He
would not per&s;uade the Di&s;&s;olution, which might be attended by Con&s;e|quences
He could not fore&s;ee, &s;o He had not &s;o good an Opinion of their
Affections to the King, or the Church, as to per&s;uade their longer Sitting,
if the King were inclined to di&s;&s;olve them. As He actually did on the 4th
or 5th of <HI>May,</HI> not three Weeks after their fir&s;t Meeting.</P>
<P>THE Temper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is again returned to &s;erve in Par|liament.</NOTE> and Con&s;titution of both Hou&s;es of Parliament, which
the King was forced to call &s;hortly after, and met on the 3d of <HI>Novem|ber</HI>
1640, was very different from the la&s;t: and They di&s;covered not
more Prejudice again&s;t any Man, than again&s;t Mr. <HI>Hyde;</HI> who was again<MILESTONE N="40">
returned to &s;erve there, and whom They were &s;orry to find among&s;t
them; as a Man They knew well to have great Affection for the Arch|bi&s;hop;
and of unalterable Devotion to the Government of the Church;
and therefore They fir&s;t laboured to find &s;ome Defect in his Election;
and then to irreconcile tho&s;e towards him, who They found had any
E&s;teem, or Kindne&s;s for him: but not finding the Succe&s;s in either, an|&s;werable
to their Expectation, They lived fairly towards him; and en|deavoured
by &s;everal Applications, to gain Credit with him; who re|turned
them their own Civilities; having had very particular Acquaintance
with many of them, whom He as much endeavoured to pre&s;erve from<MILESTONE N="50">
being prevailed upon.</P>
<P>WITHIN few Days after their Meeting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He procures the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the Earl Mar&s;hal's Court.</NOTE> He renewed the Motion He
had made in the la&s;t Parliament, again&s;t the Mar&s;hal's Court, (though
<PB N="39" REF="46">
He knew the Earl Mar&s;hal had gotten him&s;elf much into their Favour,
by his Application, and &s;ome Promi&s;es He had made to them at the
Meeting at <HI>York;</HI> and principally by his declared Aver&s;ion, and Prejudice
to the Earl of <HI>Strafford)</HI> and told them what extravagant Proceedings
there had been in that Court, &s;ince the Di&s;&s;olution of the la&s;t Parliament;
and that more Damages had been given there, by the &s;ole Judgment of
the Lord Mar&s;hal, for contumelious and reproachful Words, of which the
Law took no Notice, in two Days, than had been given by all the Juries,
in all the Courts in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall,</HI> in the whole Term, and the Days
<MILESTONE N="10">for Trial after it was ended. Upon which He got a Committee to be
named, of which him&s;elf &s;at in the Chair; and found that the fir&s;t Pre|cedent
They had in all their Records, for that Form of Proceeding, which
They had u&s;ed, and for giving of Damages for Words, was but in the
Year 1633; and the very Entrance upon this Inqui&s;ition, put an End to
that up&s;tart Court, which never pre&s;umed to fit afterwards; and &s;o that
Grievance was thoroughly aboli&s;hed. And to manife&s;t how great an Im|pre&s;&s;ion
the Alarums of this Kind made upon the highe&s;t, and the proud|e&s;t
Natures, the very next <HI>Sunday</HI> after this Motion was made in the
Hou&s;e of Commons, the Earl Mar&s;hal, &s;eeing Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> in the Clo&s;et at
<MILESTONE N="20"><HI>Whitehall,</HI> during the Time of the Sermon, He came with great Cour|te&s;y
to him, thanked him for having treated his Per&s;on &s;o civilly, when
upon &s;o ju&s;t Rea&s;on He had found fault with &s;ome of his Actions: &s;aid,
He believed He had been in the Wrong; but that He had been mi&s;led by
the Advice of Sir <HI>Harry Martin,</HI> and other Civilians, who were held
Men of great Learning, and who a&s;&s;ured him, that tho&s;e Proceedings were
ju&s;t, and lawful. He &s;aid, They had gained well by it, but &s;hould mi&s;|lead
him no more: and concluded with great Profe&s;&s;ions of Kindne&s;s, and
E&s;teem; and offered him all Offices in his Power; when in his Heart, He
did him the Honour to dete&s;t, and hate him perfectly; as He profe&s;&s;ed
<MILESTONE N="30">to all whom He tru&s;ted.</P>
<P>His Credit grew every Day in the Hou&s;e, in Spite of all the Endea|deavours,
which were u&s;ed to le&s;&s;en it. And it being evident, that He
had no Dependance upon the Court; and in&s;i&s;ted wholly upon maintain|ing
what the Law had e&s;tabli&s;hed, very many wi&s;e Men, and of E&s;tate,
and Reputation in the Kingdom (who ob&s;erved well the crooked,
and ambitious De&s;igns of tho&s;e, who de&s;ired to be thought to care
only for the good of their Country) adhered to him; and were willing
to take Advice from him, how to prevent tho&s;e Mi&s;eries, which were like
to be brought upon the Kingdom: &s;o that They who had cut out all the
<MILESTONE N="40">Work from the Beginning, and &s;eldom met with any notable Contradiction,
found them&s;elves now frequently di&s;appointed; and different Re&s;olutions
taken, to what They had propo&s;ed; which They imputed to his Activity.</P>
<P>HE was very much in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Hou&s;e; the greate&s;t Chair|man
in the Committees of the greate&s;t Moment; and very diligent in at|tending
the Service both in the Hou&s;e, and at Committees: for He had
from the Beginning of the Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He lays a&s;ide his Gown, and gives him&s;elf wholly to pub|lick Bu&s;i|ne&s;s.</NOTE> laid a&s;ide his Gown, and Practice,
and wholly given him&s;elf up to the publick Bu&s;ine&s;s; which He &s;aw &s;o
much concerned the Peace, and very Being of the Kingdom. He was
in the Chair in that Committee which con&s;idered of the Illegality of the
<MILESTONE N="50">Court of <HI>York:</HI> and the other, that examined the Mi&s;carriage of the Judges,
in the Ca&s;e of Ship-Money, and in other Ca&s;es of Judicatory, in their
&s;everal Courts; and prepared Charges thereupon again&s;t them. He was
in the Chair again&s;t the Mar&s;hal's Court. In that Committee which was
<PB N="40" REF="47">
again&s;t the Court of <HI>York,</HI> which was pro&s;ecuted with great Pa&s;&s;ion, and
took up many Weeks Debate: In that which concerned the Juri&s;diction
of the Lord Pre&s;ident, and Council, of the Marches of <HI>Wales;</HI> which
likewi&s;e held a long Time, and was pro&s;ecuted with great Bitter|ne&s;s,
and Animo&s;ity: In which the Inhabitants of the four neighbour
Counties of <HI>Salop, Worce&s;ter, Hereford,</HI> and <HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI> and con&s;equent|ly
the Knights, and Burge&s;&s;es which &s;erved for the &s;ame, were pa&s;|&s;ionately
concerned to ab&s;olve them&s;elves from the Burthen of that Ju|ri&s;diction;
and all the Officers of that Court, and Council, whereof &s;ome
were very great Men, and held Offices of great Value, laboured with equal<MILESTONE N="10">
Pa&s;&s;ion, and Concernment, to &s;upport, and maintain what was in Prac|tice,
and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and their Friends appeared accordingly.</P>
<P>HE was in the Chair in many Committees made upon private Com|plaints:
in&s;omuch as He was &s;eldom in the Afternoon free from that Ser|vice
in the Committees; as He was never ab&s;ent in Mornings from the
Hou&s;e: and He was often heard to mention one private Committee, in
which He was put accidentally into the Chair, upon an Inclo&s;ure which
had been made of great Wa&s;te, belonging to &s;ome of the Queen's Ma|nors,
without the Con&s;ent of the Tenants, the Benefit whereof had been
given by the Queen to a Servant of near Tru&s;t; who forthwith &s;old the<MILESTONE N="20">
Lands inclo&s;ed to the Earl of <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> Lord Privy Seal; who together
with his Son <HI>Mandevil,</HI> were now mo&s;t concerned to maintain the In|clo&s;ure;
again&s;t which, as well the Inhabitants of other Manors, who
claimed Common in tho&s;e Wa&s;tes, as the Queen's Tenants of the &s;ame,
made loud Complaints, as a great Oppre&s;&s;ion, carried upon them with a
very high Hand, and &s;upported by Power.</P>
<P>THE Committee &s;at in the Queen's Court;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The fir&s;t Cau&s;e of</HI> Oli|ver Crom|well's <HI>Enmity to him.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> being
one of them, appeared much concerned to countenance the Petitioners, who
were numerous, together with their Witne&s;&s;es; the Lord <HI>Mandevil</HI> being
likewi&s;e pre&s;ent as a Party, and by the Direction of the Committee, &s;itting<MILESTONE N="30">
covered: <HI>Cromwell</HI> (who had never before been heard to &s;peak in the Hou&s;e
of Commons) ordered the Witne&s;&s;es, and Petitioners in the Method of the
Proceeding; and &s;econded, and enlarged upon what They &s;aid with great
Pa&s;&s;ion; and the Witne&s;&s;es, and Per&s;ons concerned, who were a very rude
Kind of People, interrupted the Council, and Witne&s;&s;es on the other Side,
with great Clamour, when They &s;aid any Thing that did not plea&s;e them;
&s;o that Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> (who&s;e Office it was to oblige Men of all Sorts to keep
Order) was compelled to u&s;e &s;ome &s;harp Reproofs, and &s;ome Threats, to
reduce them to &s;uch a Temper, that the Bu&s;ine&s;s might be quietly heard.
<HI>Cromwell</HI> in great Fury reproached the Chairman for being partial, and<MILESTONE N="40">
that He di&s;countenanced the Witne&s;&s;es by threatening them; the Other
appealed to the Committee, which ju&s;tified him, and declared, that He
behaved him&s;elf as He ought to do; which more enflamed him, who was
already too much angry. When upon any Mention of Matter of Fact, or
the Proceeding before, and at the Inclo&s;ure, the Lord <HI>Mandevil</HI> de&s;ired
to be heard, and with great Mode&s;ty related what had been done, or ex|plained
what had been &s;aid, Mr. <HI>Cromwell</HI> did an&s;wer, and reply upon
him, with &s;o much Indecency, and Rudene&s;s, and in Language, &s;o con|trary,
and offen&s;ive, that every Man would have thought, that as their
Natures, and their Manners were as oppo&s;ite as it is po&s;&s;ible, &s;o their In|tere&s;t<MILESTONE N="50">
could never have been the &s;ame. In the End, his whole Carriage
was &s;o tempe&s;tuous, and his Behaviour &s;o in&s;olent, that the Chairman found
him&s;elf obliged to reprehend him; and to tell him, if He proceeded in
<PB N="41" REF="48">
the &s;ame Manner, He would pre&s;ently adjourn the Committee; and the
next Morning complain to the Hou&s;e of him; which He never forgave;
and took all Occa&s;ions afterwards to pur&s;ue him with the utmo&s;t Malice
and Revenge, to his Death.</P>
<P>WHEN Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> &s;at in the Chair, in the grand Committee of the
Hou&s;e, for the Extirpation of Epi&s;copacy, all that Party made great
Court to him; and the Hou&s;e keeping tho&s;e di&s;orderly Hours, and &s;eldom
ri&s;ing till after four of the Clock in the Afternoon, They frequently im|portuned
him to dine with them, at Mr. <HI>Pym</HI>'s Lodging, which was at
<MILESTONE N="10">Sir <HI>Richard Manly</HI>'s Hou&s;e, in a little Court behind <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall;</HI>
where He, and Mr. <HI>Hambden,</HI> Sir <HI>Arthur Ha&s;lerig,</HI> and two or three
more, upon a Stock kept a Table, where They tran&s;acted much Bu&s;ine&s;s;
and invited thither tho&s;e, of who&s;e Conver&s;ion They had any Hope.</P>
<P>ONE Day after Dinner, <HI>Nathaniel Fiennes,</HI> who that Day likewi&s;e dined
there, a&s;ked Mr. <HI>Hyde,</HI> whether He would ride into the Fields, and
take a little Air, it being a fine Evening; which the other con&s;enting to,
They &s;ent for their Hor&s;es, and riding together in the Fields, between
<HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Chel&s;ea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Conver&s;a|tion with</HI> Nat. Fiennes.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Fiennes</HI> a&s;ked him, what it was that in|clined
him to adhere &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately to the Church, which could not po&s;|&s;ibly
<MILESTONE N="20">be &s;upported. He an&s;wered, that He could have no other Obliga|tion
than that of his own Con&s;cience, and his Rea&s;on, that could move
with him; for He had no Relation, or Dependance upon any Church|men,
that could di&s;po&s;e him to it; that He could not conceive, how
Religion could be pre&s;erved without Bi&s;hops; nor how the Government
of the State could well &s;ub&s;i&s;t, if the Government of the Church were
altered; and a&s;ked him what Government They meant to introduce in its
Place: To which He an&s;wered, that there would be Time enough to
think of that; but a&s;&s;ured him, and wi&s;hed him to remember what He
&s;aid, that if the King re&s;olved to defend the Bi&s;hops, it would co&s;t the
<MILESTONE N="30">Kingdom much Blood; and would be the Occa&s;ion of as &s;harp a War,
as had ever been in <HI>England:</HI> for that there was a great Number of good
Men, who re&s;olved to lo&s;e their Lives, before They would ever &s;ubmit to
that Government. Which was the fir&s;t po&s;itive Declaration He had ever
heard from any particular Man of that Party; very few of them having
at that Time that Re&s;olution, much le&s;s avowing it; and if They had, the
Kingdom was in no Degree at that Time infected with that Poi&s;on, how
much &s;oever it was &s;pread afterwards.</P>
<P>WITHIN two Days after this Di&s;cour&s;e from Mr. <HI>Fiennes,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hyde,</HI>
walking between the Parliament Hou&s;e, and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> in the Church|Yard
<MILESTONE N="40">met with <HI>Harry Martin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And with</HI> Harry Mar|tin.</NOTE> with whom He lived very familiarly;
and &s;peaking together about the Proceedings of the Hou&s;es, <HI>Martin</HI> told
him, that He would undo him&s;elf by his adhering to the Court; to
which He replied, that He had no Relation to the Court, and was only
concerned to maintain the Government, and pre&s;erve the Law: and then
told him He could not conceive what He propo&s;ed to him&s;elf, for He did
not think him to be of the Opinion, or Nature with tho&s;e Men, who go|verned
the Hou&s;e; and a&s;ked him, what He thought of &s;uch, and &s;uch Men;
and He very frankly an&s;wered, that He thought them Knaves; and that
when They had done as much as They intended to do, They &s;hould be
<MILESTONE N="50">u&s;ed as They had u&s;ed others. The other pre&s;&s;ed him then to &s;ay what He
de&s;ired;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who own$ him&s;elf a Re|publican.</NOTE> to which, after a little Pau&s;e, He very roundly an&s;wered, <HI>I do not
think one Man wi&s;e enough to govern us all:</HI> which was the fir&s;t Word He
had ever heard any Man &s;peak to that Purpo&s;e; and would without
<PB N="42" REF="49">
Doubt, if it had been then communicated, or attempted, been the mo&s;t
abhorred by the whole Nation, of any De&s;ign that could be mentioned;
and yet it appears it had even &s;o early entered into the Hearts of &s;ome de&s;|perate
Per&s;ons; that Gentleman being at that Time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a very
great Fortune, and having great Credit in his Country.</P>
<P>WHILST Things were thus depending, one Morning, when there was
a Conference with the Lords, and &s;o the Hou&s;e adjourned, Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI>
being walking in the Hou&s;e, Mr. <HI>Peircy,</HI> Brother to the Earl of <HI>Northum|berland,</HI>
being a Member of the Hou&s;e, came to him, and told him, that
the King would &s;peak with him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Hyde <HI>is &s;ent for by the King.</HI></NOTE> and would have him that Afternoon to<MILESTONE N="10">
come to him. He an&s;wered, He believed it was &s;ome Mi&s;take, for that
He had not the Honour to be known to the King; and that there was
another of the &s;ame Name, of the Hou&s;e. Mr. <HI>Peircy</HI> a&s;&s;ured him,
He was the Man; and &s;o it was agreed, that at &s;uch an Hour in
the Evening, He would call on him at his Chamber; which He did, and
was by him conducted into the Gallery, and &s;o into the &s;quare Room;
where He &s;taid till the other went to the King; who in a very &s;hort Time
came thither, attended only by Mr. <HI>Peircy,</HI> who as &s;oon as Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> had
ki&s;&s;ed his Maje&s;ty's Hand, withdrew.</P>
<P>THE King told him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Di&s;cour&s;e with him.</NOTE> &startq;that He heard from all Hands, how much He<MILESTONE N="20">
was beholden to him; and that when all his Servants in the Hou&s;e of
Commons either neglected his Service, or could not appear u&s;efully in
it, He took all Occa&s;ions to do him Service; for which He thought fit
to give him his own Thanks, and to a&s;&s;ure him, that He would remem|ber
it to his Advantage.&endq; He took Notice of his Affection to the Church,
for which, He &s;aid, &startq;He thanked him more than for all the re&s;t;&endq; which
the other acknowledged with the Duty that became him; and &s;aid, &startq;He
was very happy, that his Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed with what He did; but if
He had commanded him to have withdrawn his Affection, and Reve|rence
for the Church, He would not have obeyed him;&endq; which his Ma|je&s;ty<MILESTONE N="30">
&s;aid, made him love him the better. Then He di&s;cour&s;ed of the
Pa&s;&s;ion of the Hou&s;e; and of the Bill then brought in again&s;t Epi&s;copacy;
and a&s;ked him, &startq;whether He thought They would be able to carry it;&endq;
to which He an&s;wered, &startq;He believed They could not, at lea&s;t, that it
would be very long fir&s;t.&endq; &startq;Nay (replied the King) if you'll look to
it, that They do not carry it before I go for <HI>Scotland,</HI> which will be
at &s;uch a Time, when the Armies &s;hall be di&s;banded, I will undertake
for the Church after that Time; why then (&s;aid the other) by the
Grace of God, it will not be in much Danger:&endq; with which the King
was well plea&s;ed; and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him with very gracious Expre&s;&s;ions.<MILESTONE N="40">
And this was the fir&s;t Introduction of him to the King's taking Notice
of him.</P>
<P>AFTERWARDS in that Summer, during the Time of his Maje&s;ty's

He was not &s;worn Secretary till the King's Return) being very &s;ick, &s;ent

his Hou&s;e in <HI>King's-Street;</HI> and found him in his Bed: and the Bu&s;ine&s;s
was wholly to &s;hew him a Letter from the King to him, in which He
writ to him, that He under&s;tood by &s;everal Hands, that He was very much
beholden to Mr. <HI>Hyde,</HI> for the great Zeal He &s;hewed to his Service; and<MILESTONE N="50">
therefore commanded him to &s;peak with him, and to let him know the

Subject would have enabled any Man to have done, who had thought of
it: and the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> who had much Conver&s;ation and Friend&s;hip with
him, coming accidentally and &s;uddenly into the Room, where He was
alone among&s;t his Books and Papers; conferring together of the extravagant
Proceedings of the Parliament, He, upon the Familiarity that was be|tween<MILESTONE N="10">
them, and upon the Argument that was then between them, read
the An&s;wer to him which He had prepared to the Remon&s;trance; with
which He &s;eemed much plea&s;ed, and de&s;ired him that He would permit it
to be made U&s;e of by the King, and that He might &s;hew it to his Maje&s;ty;
who found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to publi&s;h &s;ome An&s;wer in his own
Name to that Remon&s;trance, which had &s;o much poi&s;oned the Hearts of
the People; and that his Maje&s;ty was endeavouring to procure &s;uch an
An&s;wer to be drawn. The other expre&s;ly and po&s;itively refu&s;ed to give it
him, or that any U&s;e &s;hould be made of it; and reproached him for pro|po&s;ing
a Thing to him, which might prove ruinous to him, if the Hou&s;e<MILESTONE N="20">
&s;hould have the lea&s;t Imagination, that He exerci&s;ed him&s;elf in &s;uch Of|fices;
with which An&s;wer He &s;eemed &s;atisfied, and departed: no other
Per&s;on having &s;een it but the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> from whom Nothing was
ever concealed.</P>
<P>WITHIN few Days after, the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> with whom the King advi&s;ed
in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Parliament without Re&s;erve, came again to him;
and after &s;ome Apologies, told him freely, that very many had been with
the King, de&s;iring him that He would take Care that &s;ome An&s;wer might
be publi&s;hed to that Remon&s;trance; which had already done much Harm,
and would do much more if it were not an&s;wered; and that the King had<MILESTONE N="30">
&s;poken to him; upon which He had confe&s;&s;ed that He had &s;een an An&s;wer,
<PB N="45" REF="52">
that plea&s;ed him very well; but could not prevail with the Author of it to
&s;uffer it to be made U&s;e of; and told him who it was: whereupon the King
&s;eemed to wonder very much, that a Per&s;on who had appeared &s;o pub|lickly
in Defence of his Service, &s;hould be &s;o wary of a&s;&s;i&s;ting him in pri|vate:
and after many Expre&s;&s;ions of Grace towards that Gentleman, his
Maje&s;ty had commanded him to come in his Name to him; and to conjure
him to &s;end that Paper to him; and to give him his Royal Word, that no
Per&s;on living &s;hould know that He had the lea&s;t Hand in it; &s;o that no
Danger &s;hould accrue to him thereby.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10">MR. HYDE, though He was very un&s;atisfied with what the Lord <HI>Digby</HI>
had done (who&s;e Affection to him He did not in any Degree make Que&s;|tion
of, but did not like his over Activity, to which his re&s;tle&s;s Fancy
always di&s;po&s;ed him; and as He doubted not, that him&s;elf had given the
Occa&s;ion to the King to &s;end tho&s;e Commands, &s;o He had likewi&s;e enlarged
tho&s;e Commands, as He believed, in &s;uch a Manner as He thought might
mo&s;t oblige him) yet upon the real Con&s;ideration that it might do the King
much Service, He did without Delay deliver the Papers: in&s;i&s;ting upon
the Promi&s;e of Secrecy, and likewi&s;e, that his Maje&s;ty would not publi&s;h,
without fir&s;t communicating it to his Council, and as done with their
<MILESTONE N="20">Advice. And to that Purpo&s;e He affixed that Title to it, before He deli|vered
the Papers out of his Hands; believing that as it would be more for
the King's Service to carry &s;uch an Authority in the Front of it, as <HI>The
King's An&s;wer with the Advice of his Council;</HI> &s;o it could not be refu&s;ed by
them, and yet might engage them in &s;ome Di&s;plea&s;ure with the Hou&s;e of
Commons, which probably might be offended at it. The King was very
punctual in doing what was de&s;ired; and cau&s;ed it to be read at a full
Council; where many of the Lords commended it very much, and none
&s;pake again&s;t it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which by the King's Com|mand is print|ed.</NOTE> and &s;o it was publi&s;hed and printed: and it was very ap|parent
to all Men, that the King's Service was very much advanced by it:
<MILESTONE N="30">and it was not more evident to any, than to the Hou&s;e of Commons; who
knew not how to make any Expo&s;tulation upon it, it being in the King's
own Name, and publi&s;hed with the Advice of his Privy Council; &s;o that
all They could do, was to endeavour to di&s;cover who was the Penner of
it; to which Di&s;covery They were mo&s;t intent by all their &s;ecret Friends
in Court; who found Means to di&s;cover mo&s;t other Secrets to them, but in
this could do them no Service.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> and Sir <HI>John Colepepper</HI> were called to the
Privy Council, the King &s;ent for Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> to him, who had not &s;een his
Maje&s;ty from the Time He had been pre&s;ented by Mr. <HI>Peircy.</HI> He com|manded
<MILESTONE N="40">the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> to bring him when it was Night to the Queen's
back Stairs; and as &s;oon as He was there, both King and Queen came into
the Room; and when He had ki&s;&s;ed their Hands, and the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> was
withdrawn, the King told him &startq;He was much beholden to him for many
good Services; and that now He had preferred two of his Friends, it
was Time to give him &s;ome Te&s;timony of his Favour; and therefore He
had &s;ent to him to tell him, that He intended to make him his Solicitor-General,
in the Place of him who had &s;erved him &s;o ill.&endq; Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> &s;ud|denly
an&s;wered,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Hyde <HI>declines the Office of Soli|citor General.</HI></NOTE> &startq;God forbid!&endq; With which the King &s;eeming &s;urpri&s;ed,
&s;aid &startq;why God forbid?&endq; The other replied, &startq;it was in no Degree fit at
<MILESTONE N="50">this Time that He &s;hould remove the other; and if He were removed,
him&s;elf was in no Degree fit for it.&endq; The Queen &s;aid, &startq;He ought not to
&s;uffer for his Mode&s;ty: She had heard Men who could judge well, &s;ay,
that He was as fit for it as the other.&endq; Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> &s;aid &startq;that was an Ar|gument
<PB N="46" REF="53">
that Gentleman thought the other not fit for it, not that He be|lieved
<HI>him</HI> fit; which in Truth He &s;aid He was not. That it might be,
that when the Place was actually void, the King might have filled it
better with another Man, than with Mr. <HI>St. John;</HI> who&s;e Parts were
not above many others; and his Affections were below mo&s;t Mens: But
now that He was inve&s;ted in that Office, it was not a good Con|juncture
to remove him; and when it &s;hould be, He did humbly advi&s;e
his Maje&s;ty to make Choice of the able&s;t Man of the Profe&s;&s;ion, who&s;e
Affections were clear; by whom He might indeed have great Benefit;
whereas him&s;elf was young, and without any of that Learning, or Ex|perience,<MILESTONE N="10">
which might make him capable of that great Tru&s;t.&endq; The
Queen &s;aying again this was his Mode&s;ty, He replied, &startq;Madam when
you know me better, you will not find me &s;o mode&s;t a Man, but that I
hope by your Maje&s;ty's Favour in due Time to be made a better Man,
than I am at pre&s;ent; but if you believe that I know any Thing of the
Di&s;po&s;ition of the pre&s;ent Time, or of what may conduce to the King's
Service, I pray believe, that though the Solicitor will never do much
Service, He will be able to do much more Mi&s;chief if He be removed.&endq;
The King at the &s;ame Time re&s;olved to remove another Officer, who did
di&s;&s;erve him notoriou&s;ly, and to prefer Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> to that Place; with which<MILESTONE N="20">
their gracious Intention both their Maje&s;ties acquainted him; but He po|&s;itively
refu&s;ed it; and a&s;&s;ured both their Maje&s;ties, that He &s;hould be able
to do much more Service in the Condition He was in.</P>
<P>BEFORE the King left <HI>Whitehall</HI> He renewed his Commands to the three
Per&s;ons mentioned before,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is entru&s;t|ed with the Conduct of the King's Affairs in Parlia|ment.</NOTE> the Lord Vi&s;count <HI>Falkland,</HI> Sir <HI>John Colepep|per,</HI>
and Mr. <HI>Hyde,</HI> to meet con&s;tantly together, and con&s;ult upon his
Affairs; and conduct them the be&s;t Way They could in the Parliament;
and to give him con&s;tant Advice what He was to do; without which He
declared again very &s;olemnly He would make no Step in the Parliament.
Two of them were obliged by their Offices and Relations, and the other by<MILESTONE N="30">
his Duty and Inclination, to give him all Satisfaction; notwith&s;tanding
the Di&s;couragement They had &s;o lately received, in the King's going to
the Hou&s;e to demand the five Members, without ever communicating his
Intention to them; and which had made a deep Impre&s;&s;ion upon them.
And &s;o They met every Night late together; and communicated their Ob|&s;ervation
and Intelligence of the Day; and &s;o agreed what was to be done,
or attempted the next; there being very many Per&s;ons of Condition and
Intere&s;t in the Hou&s;e, who would follow their Advice, and a&s;&s;i&s;t in any
Thing They de&s;ired. And becau&s;e Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> had larger Accommodation,
in the Hou&s;e where He lived in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> than either of the other had,<MILESTONE N="40">
the Meetings at Night were for the mo&s;t Part with him; and after their
Deliberation together, what was to be put in Writing was always commit|ted
to Mr. <HI>Hyde;</HI> and when the King had left the Town, He writ as
freely to the King as either of the other did; and &s;ometimes when They
would be excu&s;ed, He went to him in great Secret.</P>
<P>HE had been from the Beginning very unbeloved by all the governing
Party; and though They took &s;ome Pains at fir&s;t to win him, yet their
Hope of that was quickly de&s;perate; and from the Night of the Prote&s;ta|tion,
He was as much in their Dete&s;tation as any Man; and the more,
that They could take no Advantage again&s;t him: and though They had a<MILESTONE N="50">
better Opinion of his Di&s;cretion, than to believe He had any Share in the
Advice of the late Proceedings, yet They were very willing that others
&s;hould believe it; and made all the Infu&s;ions They could to that Pur|po&s;e
<PB N="47" REF="54">
among&s;t tho&s;e, who took their Opinions from them; towards which
his known Friend&s;hip with the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> was an Argument very pre|valent;
and then his oppo&s;ing the Votes upon their Privilege, had in|flamed
them beyond their Temper; in&s;omuch as Mr. <HI>Hambden</HI> told him
one Day, that the Trouble that had lately befallen them, had been at|tended
with that Benefit, that They knew who were their Friends: and
the other offering to &s;peak upon the Point of Privilege, and how mon|&s;trous
a Thing it was to make a Vote &s;o contrary to the known Law; He
replied very &s;nappi&s;hly, &startq;that He well knew He had a Mind They &s;hould
<MILESTONE N="10">be all in Pri&s;on,&endq; and &s;o departed without &s;taying for an An&s;wer. Then
They imputed to him the di&s;po&s;ing the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> to &s;erve the Court;
and the Court to receive his Service; and from the Time that He and <HI>Cole|pepper</HI>
were called to the Council, They equally were enraged again&s;t both:
and now, when They had di&s;covered the Place of the nightly Meetings, that
a Secretary of State, and a Chancellor of the Exchequer, every Day went
to the Lodging of a private Per&s;on, who ought to attend them, They believed
it a Conde&s;cen&s;ion that had &s;ome other Foundation than mere Ci|vility;
yet They could not di&s;cover any Thing again&s;t them, which They
thought fit to offer in Publick.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20">IT is not ami&s;s in this Place to &s;ay &s;omewhat of tho&s;e three Per&s;ons,
who had from that Time &s;o great a Part in the Bu&s;ine&s;s that was upon
the Stage; and did in a &s;hort Time rai&s;e the Reputation of the King, and
of his Cau&s;e, to a very great Degree; and who, though They were well
united in the Oppo&s;ition of all the ill De&s;igns again&s;t the Crown; and
concurred in the publick Service with nece&s;&s;ary, and mutual Civilities to|wards
each other; yet their Principles, and Con&s;titutions were very dif|ferent;
and the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> (between whom, as is &s;aid
before, the Friend&s;hip was mo&s;t entire) had never had the lea&s;t Acquaint|ance
with Sir <HI>John Colepepper,</HI> before the Parliament; and finding them|&s;elves
<MILESTONE N="30">often of one Opinion, grew into &s;ome Conver&s;ation; and being af|ter
united in the King's Tru&s;t, They rarely conferred but in the Agita|tion
of Bu&s;ine&s;s; their Natures being in nothing like.</P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> though He was a Man of a chearful Conver&s;ation,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Some Account of the Temper and Principles of Lord</HI> Falk|land.</NOTE>
was of a &s;evere Nature, and a Lover of Virtue; yet He had great E&s;teem
for all Men of great Parts, though They applied them to ill Purpo&s;es.
He was &s;o great an Enemy to all Di&s;&s;imulation, that He cho&s;e &s;ometimes
the other Extreme, when it was not requi&s;ite. He had not the Court in
great Reverence; and had a pre&s;aging Spirit that the King would fall into
great Misfortune: and often &s;aid to his Friend, that He cho&s;e to &s;erve the
<MILESTONE N="40">King, becau&s;e Hone&s;ty obliged him to it; but that He fore&s;aw his own
Ruin by doing it. He had a better Opinion of the Church of <HI>England,</HI>
and the Religion of it, than of any other Church, and Religion; and had
extraordinary Kindne&s;s for very many Churchmen; and if He could have
helped, or prevented it, there &s;hould have been no Attempts again&s;t it.
But He had in his own Judgment &s;uch a Latitude in Opinion, that He
did not believe any Part of the Order, or Government of it, to be &s;o e&s;|&s;entially
nece&s;&s;ary to Religion, but that it might be parted with, and al|tered,
for a notable publick Benefit, or Convenience: and that the Crown
it&s;elf ought to gratify the People, in yielding to many Things; and to
<MILESTONE N="50">part with &s;ome Power, rather than to run the Hazards, which would at|tend
the Refu&s;al. But He was &s;wayed in this by a Belief, that the King
would in the End be prevailed with to yield to what was pre&s;&s;ed; and this
Opinion wrought too much upon too many.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="55">
ALBEIT He had the greate&s;t Compliance with the Weakne&s;s, and even
the Humour of other Men, when there could be no Su&s;picion of Flattery;
and the greate&s;t Addre&s;s to inform, and reform them; yet towards the
King, who many Times ob&s;tinately adhered to many Conclu&s;ions, which
did not naturally re&s;ult from good Premi&s;es; and did love to argue many
Things, to which He would not &s;o po&s;itively adhere, He did not practi&s;e
that Conde&s;cen&s;ion; but contradicted him with more Bluntne&s;s, and by
&s;harp Sentences; and in &s;ome Particulars (as of the Church) to which
the King was in Con&s;cience mo&s;t devoted: and of this his Maje&s;ty often
complained; and cared le&s;s to confer with him in private, and was le&s;s<MILESTONE N="10">
per&s;uaded by him, than his Affairs, and the other's great Parts, and Wi&s;|dom
would have required: thought He had not a better Opinion of any
Man's Sincerity, or Fidelity towards him.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>John Colepepper</HI> had &s;pent &s;ome Years of his Youth in foreign Parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Sir</HI> John Colepepper.</NOTE>
and e&s;pecially in Armies; where He had &s;een good Service, and very well
ob&s;erved it; and might have made a very good Officer, if He had intended
it. He was of a rough Nature; a hot Head; and of great Courage;
which had engaged him in many Quarrels, and Duels; wherein He &s;till
behaved him&s;elf very &s;ignally. He had in a very good Sea&s;on, and after
a &s;mall Wa&s;te of his Fortune, retired from that Cour&s;e of Life, and mar|ried,<MILESTONE N="20">
and betook him&s;elf to a Country Life; and &s;tudied the Bu&s;ine&s;s of
the Country, and the Concernments of it, in which He was very well
ver&s;ed; and being a Man of Sharpne&s;s of Parts, and Volubility of Lan|guage,
He was frequently made Choice of to appear at the Council-Board,
in tho&s;e Matters which related to the Country: in the managing whereof,
his Abilities were well taken Notice of. His E&s;tate was very moderate,
and his u&s;ual Expen&s;e exceeded it not; not being delighted with Delica|cies
of any Nature, or indeed ever acquainted with them. He had Infir|mities,
which &s;ometimes made a Noi&s;e; but his Parts, and Abilities made
him very acceptable to his Neighbours, and to tho&s;e who were mo&s;t con|&s;iderable<MILESTONE N="30">
in their E&s;tates, and mo&s;t popular; &s;o that with very little Op|po&s;ition,
He had been cho&s;en to be Knight of that great County <HI>Kent</HI>
for the Parliament; where He quickly made him&s;elf to be taken Notice
of. He was proud, and ambitious, and very much di&s;po&s;ed to improve
his Fortune; which He knew well how to do, by Indu&s;try, and Thrift,
without &s;tooping to any corrupt Ways, to which He was not inclined.</P>
<P>HE did not love the Per&s;ons of many of tho&s;e who were the violent
Managers; and le&s;s their De&s;igns: and therefore He no &s;ooner knew that
He was well &s;poken of at Court, but He expo&s;ed him&s;elf to the Invi|tation,
and heartily embraced that Intere&s;t: and when He came thither,<MILESTONE N="40">
He might very well be thought a Man of no very good Breeding; having
never &s;acrificed to the Mu&s;es, or conver&s;ed in any polite Company. He
was warm, and po&s;itive in Debates; and of pre&s;ent Fancy to object, and
find Fault with what was propo&s;ed; and indeed would take any Argu|ment
in Pieces, and expo&s;e it excellently to a full View; and leave No|thing
to Chance, or Accident, without making it fore&s;een; but after that,
knew not &s;o well what to judge, and determine; and was &s;o irre&s;olute,
and had a Fancy &s;o perpetually working, that after a Conclu&s;ion made,
He would the next Day, in the Execution of it, and &s;ometimes after, rai&s;e
new Doubts, and make new Objections; which always occa&s;ioned Trouble;<MILESTONE N="50">
and &s;ometimes produced Inconvenience.</P>
<P>In Matters of Religion, He was in his Judgment very indifferent; but
more inclined to what was e&s;tabli&s;hed, to avoid the Accidents which com|monly
<PB N="49" REF="56">
attend a Change, without any Motives from his Con&s;cience;
which yet He kept to him&s;elf; and was well content to have it believed
that the Activity proceeded from thence. He had, with all this uncourt|line&s;s
(for &s;ure no Man le&s;s appeared a Courtier) and Ungracefulne&s;s in
his Mein, and Motion, a wonderful In&s;inuation and Addre&s;s into the Ac|ceptation,
and Confidence of the King, and Queen; and Flattery being
a Weed not &s;o natural to the Air, and Soil of the Country, where He
had wholly lived, He was believed to &s;peak with all Plainne&s;s and Since|rity;
when no Man more complied with tho&s;e Infirmities they both had;
<MILESTONE N="10">and by that Compliance prevailed often over them.</P>
<P>HE had a very tragical Way in expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf, to rai&s;e the Fears
and Apprehen&s;ions of tho&s;e, who were naturally apprehen&s;ive of Dangers:
and by this Means He prevailed marvellou&s;ly with the Queen, in tho&s;e
Matters to which She was mo&s;t aver&s;e; by repre&s;enting Things as di&s;mally
to her as He could well do: and on the other Hand, to the King (who
was naturally very Sanguine) He was full of Compliance; cheri&s;hed all
his Hopes, and Imaginations; and rai&s;ed and improved tho&s;e Hopes very
frequently by Expedients very unagreeable to the End propo&s;ed. He was
then (as was &s;aid before) very po&s;itive in his Conclu&s;ions: as if He did
<MILESTONE N="20">not propo&s;e a Thing that might come to pa&s;s, but what infallibly mu&s;t
be &s;o; which was a Temper the King could not contend with; and did
&s;o much &s;u&s;pect him&s;elf (which was his greate&s;t Infirmity, and the chief
Ground of all his Sufferings) that He did believe a Man of whom He
thought very well, did know every Thing that He confidently in&s;i&s;ted
upon. But his greate&s;t Advantage was (be&s;ides his Diligence in Speaking
as often as He could with the King, and Queen, and always with the
Queen, upon any important Coun&s;el) that He had an entire Confidence
and Friend&s;hip with Mr. <HI>John A&s;hburnham,</HI> whom the King loved, and
tru&s;ted very much; and who always imprinted that Advice in the King's
<MILESTONE N="30">Mind, which the other had infu&s;ed; and being a Member of the Hou&s;e,
was always ready to report the Service He did his Maje&s;ty there, as ad|vantageou&s;ly
as the Bu&s;ine&s;s would bear.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> was in his Nature and Di&s;po&s;ition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Mr. <HI>Hyde.</HI></NOTE> different from both the
other; which never begot the lea&s;t Di&s;agreement between the Lord <HI>Falk|land</HI>
and him. He was of a very chearful and open Nature, without
any Di&s;&s;imulation; and delivered his Opinion of Things or Per&s;ons, where
it was convenient, without Re&s;erve, or Di&s;gui&s;e; and was at lea&s;t tena|cious
enough of his Opinion, and never departed from it out of Compli|ance
with any Man. He had a very particular Devotion and Pa&s;&s;ion for
<MILESTONE N="40">the Per&s;on of the King; and did believe him the mo&s;t, and the be&s;t
Chri&s;tian in the World. He had a mo&s;t zealous E&s;teem and Reverence
for the Con&s;titution of the Government; and believed it &s;o equally poi&s;|ed,
that if the lea&s;t Branch of the Prerogative was torn off, or parted
with, the Subject &s;uffered by it, and that his Right was impaired: and He
was as much troubled when the Crown exceeded its ju&s;t Limits, and
thought it's Prerogative hurt by it: and therefore not only never con&s;ented
to any Diminution of the King's Authority, but always wi&s;hed that the
King would not con&s;ent to it, with what Importunity or Impetuo&s;ity &s;o|ever
it was de&s;ired and pre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50">HE had taken more Pains than &s;uch Men u&s;e to do, in the Examina|tion
of Religion; having always conver&s;ed with tho&s;e of different Opi|nions
with all Freedom, and Affection; and had very much Kindne&s;s and
E&s;teem for many, who were in no Degree of his own Judgment; and
<PB N="50" REF="57">
upon all this, He did really believe the Church of <HI>England</HI> the mo&s;t ex|actly
formed and framed for the Encouragement and Advancement of
Learning, and Piety, and for the Pre&s;ervation of Peace, of any Church
in the World; That the taking away any of its Revenue, and applying
it to &s;ecular U&s;es, was Robbery, and notorious Sacrilege; and that the
dimini&s;hing the Lu&s;tre it had, and had always had in the Government,
by removing the Bi&s;hops out of the Hou&s;e of Peers, was a Violation of
Ju&s;tice; the removing a Land-mark; and the &s;haking the very Foundation
of Government; and therefore He always oppo&s;ed, upon the Impul&s;ion
of Con&s;cience, all Mutations in the Church; and did always believe, let<MILESTONE N="10">
the Sea&s;on, or the Circum&s;tance be what it would, that any Compliance
was pernicious: and that a peremptory and ob&s;tinate Refu&s;al, that might
put Men in De&s;pair of what They laboured for, and take away all Hope
of obtaining what They de&s;ired, would reconcile more Per&s;ons to the Go|vernment,
than the gratifying them in Part; which only whetted their
Appetite to de&s;ire more, and their Confidence in demanding it.</P>
<P>THOUGH He was of a Complexion and Humour very far from De&s;pair;
yet He did believe the King would be oppre&s;&s;ed by that Party which then
governed; and that They who followed, and &s;erved him would be de|&s;troyed;
&s;o that it was not Ambition of Power, or Wealth, that engaged<MILESTONE N="20">
him to embark in &s;o very hazardous an Imployment; but ab&s;tractly the
Con&s;ideration of his Duty; and He often u&s;ed to apply tho&s;e Words of
<HI>Cicero,</HI> to him&s;elf, <HI>Mea Aetas incidit in id Bellum cujus altera Pars Sceleris
nimium habuit, altera Felicitatis parum.</HI> It is very probable, that if his
Acce&s;s at that Time had been as frequent to the King, as Sir <HI>John Cole|pepper</HI>'s
was, or the Lord <HI>Falkland's</HI> might have been, &s;ome Things might
have been left undone, the doing whereof brought much Prejudice to the
King; for all his Principles were much more agreeable to his Maje&s;ty's
own Judgment, than tho&s;e of either of the other; and what He &s;aid was
of equal Authority with him; and when any Advice was given by either<MILESTONE N="30">
of the other, the King u&s;ually a&s;ked, &startq;whether <HI>Ned Hyde</HI> were of that
Opinion;&endq; and They always very ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;&s;ed, that He was
not: but his having no Relation of Service, and &s;o no Pretence to be &s;een
often at Court; and the great Jealou&s;y that was entertained towards him,
made it nece&s;&s;ary to him to repair only in the dark to the King upon
emergent Occa&s;ions, and leave the Re&s;t to be imparted by the other two;
and the Differences in their Natures, and Opinions never produced any
Di&s;union between them in tho&s;e Councils which concerned the Conduct
of the King's Service; but They proceeded with great Unanimity; and
very manife&s;tly much advanced the King's Bu&s;ine&s;s, from the very low<MILESTONE N="40">
State it was in, when They were fir&s;t tru&s;ted; the other two having al|ways
much Deference to the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> who allayed their Pa&s;&s;ions;
to which They were both enough inclined.</P>
<P>WHEN the two Bills were &s;ent to the King, <HI>for the granting the Militia,</HI>
and <HI>the removing the Bi&s;hops out of the Hou&s;e of Peers,</HI> mo&s;t Men did
believe that the King would never give his A&s;&s;ent to either of the&s;e two;
though very many had concurred in them for no other Rea&s;on, than be|cau&s;e
They were a&s;&s;ured He would not refu&s;e; and others upon Confi|dence
that He would; and therefore would not render them&s;elves obnoxi|ous
by oppo&s;ing them: upon all which the Queen continued her Re&s;olu|tion;<MILESTONE N="50">
and ha&s;tened her Journey that she might be out of the Way, and
thereby the King might the more re&s;olutely reject tho&s;e Bills, which He
intended to do; and the Hou&s;es the more importunately pre&s;&s;ed the Di&s;|patch
<PB N="51" REF="58">
of the Bills, as &s;oon as the Day was appointed for the Queen's be|ginning
her Journey from <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> towards <HI>Dover.</HI></P>
<P>IN this Perplexity, when Nothing was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary as the mo&s;t ob&s;ti|nate
Re&s;olution, Sir <HI>John Colepepper,</HI> who was naturally inclined to Ex|pedients;
and in difficult Ca&s;es, that is, Ca&s;es made difficult, by the Per|ver&s;ene&s;s
of &s;upercilious Contenders, to Compo&s;ition, much de&s;ired, that
the King would pa&s;s that again&s;t the Bi&s;hops, and ab&s;olutely reject the
other; which He did in Truth believe would &s;atisfy &s;o many, that tho&s;e
that remained un&s;atisfied, would not have Credit enough, to give any fur|ther
<MILESTONE N="10">Di&s;turbance; and in his own Judgment, as hath been &s;aid before,
He thought the Matter of little Importance; but He knew that Argu|ment
would make no other Impre&s;&s;ion upon the King, than to the Di&s;|advantage
of the Arguer; and if He had thought him&s;elf obliged to have
enacted one, He would have cho&s;en to have pa&s;&s;ed that for the Militia,
rather than the other; He urged therefore to the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sir</HI> John Colepepper <HI>advi&s;es the King to pa&s;s the Bill a|gain&s;t the Bi&s;hops.</HI></NOTE> no other Per&s;on
pre&s;ent, the Nece&s;&s;ity of giving the Parliament Satisfaction in one of tho&s;e
Bills; and that there were more who would be &s;atisfied with that concern|ing
the Bi&s;hops, than with the other concerning the Militia; and there|fore
it would be be&s;t to gratify the major Part. Then He expo&s;ed the
<MILESTONE N="20">dreadful Con&s;equences which would attend the yielding in the Point of
the Militia; as if it would be the next Day in their Power to depo&s;e him;
and all the tragical Effects of granting that Authority. He &s;eemed in no
Degree to undervalue the Mi&s;chief of con&s;enting to the Bill again&s;t the
Bi&s;hops; yet that it would be attended with that pre&s;ent Benefit, that the
Church would be free from farther Apprehen&s;ion; and that this Degra|dation
would &s;ecure the Function, and the Revenue; and that when
the&s;e Jealou&s;ies and Mi&s;under&s;tandings &s;hould be once compo&s;ed, that Bill
would be ea&s;ily repealed, by the Experience how much the Government
was hurt by it; and whil&s;t the Sword remained in the King's own Hands,
<MILESTONE N="30">there would be no Attempt to make farther Alterations. The King a&s;ked
him, whether <HI>Ned Hyde</HI> was of that Mind; to which He an&s;wered, He
was not, nor did wi&s;h that either of the Bills &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed, which He
thought as the Time was, could not be a rea&s;onable Judgment; the King
&s;aid, <HI>it was his; and that He would run the Hazard.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN He found He could not prevail there, He went to the Queen;
and repeated all the Arguments He had u&s;ed to the King, with his u&s;ual
Vehemence; and added, that He exceedingly apprehended that by &s;ome
Means or other, upon this Refu&s;al of the King's, her Maje&s;ty's Journey
would be &s;topped; and that She would not be &s;uffered to tran&s;port her&s;elf
<MILESTONE N="40">out of the Kingdom; and therefore He heartily wi&s;hed that She would
&s;o u&s;e her Credit with the King, that He might pa&s;s that Act concerning
the Bi&s;hops, which He &s;aid would lay &s;uch an Obligation upon both
Hou&s;es, as would redound to her Maje&s;ty's Advantage.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who is pre|vailed on by the Queen to do &s;o.</NOTE> The Queen was
&s;o terrified with the Apprehen&s;ion of her being hindered from pur&s;uing
her Purpo&s;e, that She gave not over her Importunity with the King, till
She had prevailed with him; and &s;o that Bill for removing the Bi&s;hops
out of the Hou&s;e of Peers was pa&s;&s;ed by Commi&s;&s;ion; when both their
Maje&s;ties were upon their Way, and in their Journey to <HI>Dover.</HI></P>
<P>NOTHING that is here &s;aid mu&s;t reflect upon the Memory of Sir <HI>John
<MILESTONE N="50">Colepepper,</HI> as if He were corrupted in his Affections to the Church; or
gave this Advice to gratify and plea&s;e other Men, or for any particular
Advantage to him&s;elf, of all which He was very innocent. It is &s;aid be|fore,
that in his Judgment He looked upon the Thing as what might be
<PB N="52" REF="59">
con&s;cientiou&s;ly con&s;ented to; and then his real Apprehen&s;ion of Danger,
and Mi&s;chief to the King (to whom He bore all po&s;&s;ible Fidelity) by re|fu&s;ing
it, &s;o far wrought upon his warm Con&s;titution, that He did really
believe it to be his Duty to be &s;olicitous to the vehement Degree He was.
But He quickly found He had been deceived, at lea&s;t in the Imagination,
that the con&s;enting to that one Bill would at all allay their Pa&s;&s;ion. They
were on the contrary &s;o far from being plea&s;ed with it, that They imme|diately
betook them&s;elves to enquire, &startq;who the evil Coun&s;ellors were,
who di&s;&s;uaded his Maje&s;ty from con&s;enting to the other concerning the
Militia;&endq; which was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to all their Purpo&s;es: and forthwith<MILESTONE N="10">
&s;ent &s;ome of their Me&s;&s;engers to the King, whil&s;t He &s;taid at <HI>Dover,</HI> to
complain of &s;uch evil Coun&s;el; and to u&s;e all Importunity, that He would
pa&s;s it, as a Matter of ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity for the Peace, and Security of
the Kingdom; and for the carrying on the Service for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the
Rebellion in <HI>Ireland;</HI> with many new Expre&s;&s;ions &startq;of the Pre&s;umption
of tho&s;e malignant Per&s;ons, who gave his Maje&s;ty &s;uch Advice,&endq; and
with Boldne&s;s enough, that the King &s;hould prefer &s;uch Advice, before
the Wi&s;dom of the Parliament.</P>
<P>THEY who hated the Bi&s;hops mo&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Effect of this Conde&s;|cen&s;ion on the &s;everal Par|ties.</NOTE> and were glad that They were rid
of the Oppo&s;ition They gave them in all their Demands, &s;eemed not at<MILESTONE N="20">
all contented; but enlarged exceedingly upon the Mi&s;chief, in not grant|ing
the Militia. And no Doubt there were many the le&s;s plea&s;ed with the
pa&s;&s;ing the other, in doubt, that They &s;hould thereby lo&s;e the A&s;&s;i&s;tance
of very many towards the utter Extirpation of Epi&s;copacy, and the Di&s;|po&s;al
of all Church Lands, upon which their Hearts were &s;et; and who
would with the more Choler have concurred with them, if that Bill, as
well as the other, had been rejected; and therefore They rather wi&s;hed
They had the other, which They knew would bring all their Ends to
pa&s;s. They who loved the Church, and were afraid of &s;o great an Alte|ration
in the Frame and Con&s;titution of Parliament, as the utter taking<MILESTONE N="30">
away of one of the <HI>Three E&s;tates,</HI> of which the Parliament is compound|ed,
were infinitely provoked; and lamented the pa&s;&s;ing that Act, as an
Introduction to the entire De&s;truction of the Government of the Church,
and to the Alteration of the Religion of the Kingdom: and very many
who more con&s;idered the Policy, than the Ju&s;tice, and Piety of the State,
did ever after believe, that being removed out of the Parliament,
the pre&s;erving them in the Kingdom, was not worth any notable Conten|tion.
Then They looked upon the King's Conde&s;cen&s;ion in this Particular,
in a Subject that all Men knew had a wonderful Influence upon his Con|&s;cience,
as He often took Occa&s;ion to profe&s;s, as a Manife&s;tation, that He<MILESTONE N="40">
would not be con&s;tant in retaining, and denying any Thing that &s;hould
be impetuou&s;ly, and fiercely demanded; which as it exceedingly con|firmed
tho&s;e, who were engaged in that Party; &s;o it abated the Courage
of too many, who had always oppo&s;ed them, and heartily dete&s;ted their
Proceedings; and made them more remi&s;s in their Attendance at the
Hou&s;e; and le&s;s &s;olicitous for any Thing that was done there: who by
degrees fir&s;t became a neutral Party, believing They &s;hould be &s;afe, in
angering no Body; and when They afterwards found no Security in that
Indifferency, They adhered to tho&s;e, who They &s;aw had the be&s;t Succe&s;s;
and &s;o went Sharers with them in their Future Attempts, according to<MILESTONE N="50">
their &s;everal Tempers, and Inclinations.</P>
<P>THE Benefit that would redound to the King from not pa&s;&s;ing the
other Bill of the Militia, more than avoiding the Infamy of con&s;enting to
<PB N="53" REF="60">
it, was not evident to di&s;cerning Men; for They fore&s;aw that They would
quickly wre&s;t it out of his Hands without his Con&s;ent; and that the Re|putation
of the Parliament was &s;o great, that what&s;oever the two Hou&s;es
(which the People looked upon as the Parliament) &s;hould concur in, and
enjoin to be done, the People would look upon as Law, and ob&s;erve it
accordingly; &s;o that when by the Removal of &s;o many Voices out of the
Hou&s;e of Peers, as the Bi&s;hops made, who were always firm to the Crown,
and Government, the Hou&s;e of Commons found a Concurrence from the
Lords, in all They propo&s;ed, their joint Determination would find Obe|dience,
<MILESTONE N="10">for the mo&s;t Part, from the People: whom there were all En|deavours
u&s;ed to corrupt, and po&s;&s;e&s;s, by pre&s;ently printing, and cau&s;ing
to be read in Churches, all their Me&s;&s;ages, and Petitions to the King;
that They might &s;ee all their Concernments were for the good of the
Kingdom, and Pre&s;ervation of the People.</P>
<P>WHEN the King accompanied the Queen to <HI>Dover,</HI> where They ex|pected
a Wind many Days, He &s;ent the Prince, under his new Gover|nour,
the Marquis of <HI>Hertford,</HI> to <HI>Richmond;</HI> that there might be no
Room for the Jealou&s;y, that the Prince &s;hould be tran&s;ported beyond the
Seas; which had been infu&s;ed into the Minds of many; and would have
<MILESTONE N="20">made a great Noi&s;e, if He had waited upon his Mother to <HI>Dover:</HI> but as
&s;oon as the Wind appeared hopeful for her Maje&s;ty's Embarkation, the
King &s;ent an Expre&s;s to <HI>Richmond,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King &s;ends for the Prince to</HI> Greenwich.</NOTE> that the Prince &s;hould attend his Ma|je&s;ty
at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> the Saturday following: the Marquis being at that
Time very much indi&s;po&s;ed by a Defluction upon his Eyes, and a Ca|tarrh.
The Parliament being pre&s;ently informed, as They had Spies in
all Places, of this Direction, and there being yet no Certainty of the
Queen's being embarked, was much troubled; and re&s;olved to &s;end to
his Maje&s;ty, by Members of both Hou&s;es, to de&s;ire that the Prince might
not remove from <HI>Richmond,</HI> at lea&s;t till the Marquis recovered Health
<MILESTONE N="30">enough to be able to attend him; and at the &s;ame Time &s;ent an expre&s;s
Order to the Marquis, that He &s;hould not &s;uffer the Prince to go from
thence, till He him&s;elf &s;hould be able to go with him.</P>
<P>THEY appointed one Lord and two Commoners to carry the Me&s;&s;age
to the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr</HI> Hyde <HI>is &s;ent to the King on that Occa&s;ion.</HI></NOTE> whom They believed to be &s;till at <HI>Dover;</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI>
coming accidentally into the Hou&s;e, when the Matter was in Debate, They
appointed him to be one of the Me&s;&s;engers; which no Excu&s;es could free
him from, for They did not intend it as a Favour to him; &s;o that They
were obliged pre&s;ently to begin their Journey; and that Night They went
to <HI>Grave&s;end.</HI> The next Day They were fully informed of the Queen's
<MILESTONE N="40">being gone to Sea; and that the King would be that Night at <HI>Canter|bury;</HI>
whither the Me&s;&s;engers made what Ha&s;te They could; and found
his Maje&s;ty there, with a very little Court, mo&s;t of his Servants having
Leave to go before to <HI>London,</HI> the better to provide them&s;elves for a far|ther
Journey. When They read their Me&s;&s;age to the King, in the hear|ing
whereof He &s;hewed no Satisfaction, He appointed them to attend
him after He had &s;upped, and They &s;hould receive their An&s;wer: And
accordingly about nine of the Clock He cau&s;ed it to be read, and delivered
it to them; taking no Notice of Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> as if He had been known to
him. That Me&s;&s;enger who was a Member of the Hou&s;e of Peers, received
<MILESTONE N="50">it from his Maje&s;ty, as of Right He ought to do, that it might be fir&s;t
reported to that Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Hyde</HI> was very much troubled when He heard the An&s;wer read;
for it had much Sharpne&s;s in it, which at that Time could only provoke
<PB N="54" REF="61">
them: So without taking any Notice of it to his Companions, He pretended
to them only to be very weary, and de&s;irous to go to Bed, and bade them
good Night; having the Conveniency offered him by the Lord <HI>Grandi&s;on,</HI>
(his familiar Friend) to lodge with him in a Hou&s;e, next the Court: And
&s;o the other two Me&s;&s;engers making Ha&s;te to find &s;ome Lodging in an Inn;
He &s;ent the Lord <HI>Grandi&s;on</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> to de&s;ire the King
that He might &s;peak with him before He went into his Bed. The King
was half undre&s;&s;ed, yet &s;aid He would &s;tay for him, and bade that he
&s;hould make Ha&s;te to the back Stairs; and as &s;oon as He came thither, the
Duke went in to the King, who immediately came out in his Night Dre&s;s;<MILESTONE N="10">
and the Duke having before &s;ent all other Servants from thence, retired
likewi&s;e him&s;elf.</P>
<P>HE told the King that &startq;He was &s;orry that his Maje&s;ty had expre&s;&s;ed
&s;o much Di&s;plea&s;ure in his An&s;wer; which could produce no Good,
and might do Hurt; and therefore He de&s;ired He would call for it, and
alter &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions;&endq; which his Maje&s;ty was not inclined to do; en|larging
him&s;elf with much Sharpne&s;s upon the In&s;olence of the Me&s;&s;age,
and of the Order They had &s;ent to the Marquis of <HI>Hertford:</HI> And &s;eemed
to apprehend that the Prince would not be &s;uffered to attend him at
<HI>Greenwich;</HI> the Thought whereof had cau&s;ed that Warmth in him. It<MILESTONE N="20">
was now <HI>Friday</HI> Night, and his Maje&s;ty re&s;olved the next Night to be at
<HI>Greenwich;</HI> and to &s;tay there all <HI>Sunday;</HI> and then to pur&s;ue his former
Re&s;olutions: Upon which Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> told him, &startq;that He hoped the
Prince would be at <HI>Greenwich</HI> as &s;oon as He, and then that Point would
be cleared; that They could not report His Me&s;&s;age to the Parliament
till <HI>Monday</HI> Morning; and that They might well attend upon his Ma|je&s;ty
again on <HI>Sunday,</HI> and receive his Plea&s;ure; and at that Time the
Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Colepepper</HI> would be likewi&s;e pre&s;ent; when
his Maje&s;ty might take what Re&s;olution He plea&s;ed in that Matter; and
therefore He be&s;ought his Maje&s;ty that He would pre&s;ently &s;end a Ser|vant<MILESTONE N="30">
to the other two Me&s;&s;engers, at &s;uch an Inn, for the An&s;wer He
had delivered to them, of which He would farther con&s;ider when He
came to <HI>Greenwich;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">On whom He prevails to al|ter his An|&s;wer to the Parliament.</NOTE> where He commanded them to attend him on <HI>Sun|day,</HI>
and that He would di&s;patch them &s;oon enough for them to be at
<HI>London</HI> that Night.&endq; All which his Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to con&s;ent to,
and immediately &s;ent a Gentleman to them for the Paper, with that In|junction;
and then &s;ent it by the Lord <HI>Grandi&s;on</HI> the &s;ame Night to
Mr. <HI>Hyde,</HI> whom He had commanded to attend him on <HI>Sunday</HI> Morn|ing,
&s;aying He had very much to &s;ay to him.</P>
<P>WHEN his Maje&s;ty came to <HI>Greenwich,</HI> He found the Prince there<MILESTONE N="40">
with his Governour, who though indi&s;po&s;ed in his Health, without return|ing
any An&s;wer to the Parliament, brought the Prince very early from
<HI>Richmond</HI> to <HI>Greenwich;</HI> with which the King was very much plea&s;ed,
and in very good Humour. And the next Morning when Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> came
to Court (to whom his Companions had told, that the King had &s;ent for
his An&s;wer to them again; and appointed them to attend him for it at
<HI>Greenwich</HI> that Afternoon; which They had agreed together to do) the
King being come into the Privy Chamber, and &s;eeing him there, a&s;ked
him aloud, where the others who came in the Me&s;&s;age with him were;
and &s;aid, He would expect them in the Afternoon; and &s;o di&s;cour&s;ing<MILESTONE N="50">
&s;omewhat of the Weather, that all Men heard, He came near him, and
as it were pa&s;&s;ing by (which no Body took Notice of, the Room not being
full) He bade him dine with <HI>Porter,</HI> at the back Stairs, that He might be
<PB N="55" REF="62">
in the Privy Chamber when He ro&s;e from Dinner; and after He had
dined He found him there; and at that Hour mo&s;t People looking after
their own Dinner, his Maje&s;ty did without any Body's taking Notice of it,
bid him follow him into the Privy Gallery; where He was no &s;ooner en|tered,
than the King locked the Door with his own Key, &s;aying, &startq;we
will not now be di&s;turbed, for there is no Man in the Hou&s;e now, who
hath a Key to this Door.&endq; Then He &s;aid, &startq;I will &s;ay Nothing of the
An&s;wer, for I am &s;ure <HI>Falkland</HI> and <HI>Colepepper</HI> will be here anon; and
then prepare one, and I will not differ with you; for now I have got|ten
<MILESTONE N="10"><HI>Charles,</HI> I care not what An&s;wer I &s;end to them.&endq;</P>
<P>THEN He &s;pake of many Particulars of the Parliament with Warmth
enough;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Kings Di&s;cour&s;e to him at</HI> Greenwich.</NOTE> and lamented his having con&s;ented to the Bill concerning
the Bi&s;hops, which He &s;aid, He was prevailed upon to do, for his
Wife's &s;ecurity; but He &s;hould now be without any Fear to di&s;plea&s;e
them. He &s;aid, He would lay the next Night at <HI>Theobalds;</HI> where He
would &s;tay a Day or two, that his Servants might provide them&s;elves to
attend him Northward: That He &s;hould not &s;ee him any more before
He took that Journey; and therefore He required him upon all Occa&s;ions
to write to him, and adverti&s;e him of &s;uch Matters as were fit for him to
<MILESTONE N="20">know; and to prepare and &s;end him An&s;wers to &s;uch Declarations, or
Me&s;&s;ages as the Parliament &s;hould &s;end to him: He &s;aid, He knew well
the Danger He underwent if it were di&s;covered: but his Maje&s;ty a&s;&s;ured
him, and bade him be confident of it, that no Per&s;on alive, but him&s;elf and
his two Friends, &s;hould know that He corre&s;ponded with his Maje&s;ty; and
that He would him&s;elf tran&s;cribe every Paper in his own Hand, before He
would &s;hew it to any Man, and before his Secretary &s;hould write it out.
Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> told him, that He writ a very ill Hand, which would give his
Maje&s;ty too much Trouble to tran&s;cribe him&s;elf, and that He had &s;o much
Friend&s;hip with Secretary <HI>Nicholas,</HI> that He was well contented He &s;hould
<MILESTONE N="30">be tru&s;ted: to which the King &s;aid, <HI>Nicholas</HI> was a very hone&s;t Man; and
He would tru&s;t him in any Thing that concerned him&s;elf; but in this Par|ticular,
which would be &s;o penal to the other, if it &s;hould be known, it
was not nece&s;&s;ary; for He would quickly learn to read the Hand, if it
were writ at fir&s;t with a little the more Care; and no Body &s;hould &s;ee it
but him&s;elf. And his Maje&s;ty continued &s;o firm to this Re&s;olution, that
though the Declarations from the Hou&s;es &s;hortly after grew &s;o voluminous,
that the An&s;wers frequently contained five or &s;ix Sheets of Paper, very
clo&s;ely writ; his Maje&s;ty always tran&s;cribed them with his own Hand;
which &s;ometimes took him up two or three Days, and a good Part of the
<MILESTONE N="40">Night, before He produced them to the Council; where they were fir&s;t
read, and then He burned the Originals. And He gave him&s;elf no Ea&s;e in
this particular, till Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> left the Parliament, and by his Maje&s;ty's
Command attended upon him at <HI>York:</HI> which will be mentioned in it's
Time.</P>
<P>WHILST the King held this Di&s;cour&s;e with him in the Privy Gallery,
many of the Lords were come from <HI>London;</HI> and not finding him, the
Earls of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> who by their Offices had Keys to the Gal|lery,
opened that Door, and went in; and &s;eeing no Body there, walked
to the farther End; where in a turning Walk the King and Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI>
<MILESTONE N="50">were: And though They pre&s;ently drew back, the King him&s;elf as well as
Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> was a little di&s;compo&s;ed; and &s;aid, &startq;I am very &s;orry for this
Accident, I meant to have &s;aid &s;omewhat to you of tho&s;e Gentlemen;

<PB N="56" REF="63">
&s;end me pre&s;ently the An&s;wer for your Me&s;&s;age, and then attend with
your Companions in the Privy Chamber, and I will come out and deliver
it to them:&endq; and &s;o He withdrew: the two Earls &s;miling, and &s;aluting
Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> civilly.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Where He draws up the King's An|&s;wer.</NOTE> He quickly found the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> and <HI>Colepepper,</HI>
and They as quickly agreed upon the An&s;wer which the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI>
carried to the King: And his Maje&s;ty approving, and &s;igning it, He came
out, and delivered it, after He had cau&s;ed it to be read, to the Me&s;&s;engers
who attended to receive it; and who went that Night to <HI>London;</HI> and the
next Morning at the fir&s;t &s;itting of the Hou&s;es, reported, and delivered it.</P>
<P>IT was expected, and believed, that as &s;oon as the Queen was gone<MILESTONE N="10">
for <HI>Holland,</HI> the King would return to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> and re&s;ide there. And
many wi&s;e Men were of Opinion, that if He had done &s;o, He would have
been treated with more Duty and Re&s;pect; and that He would be able to
bring his Bu&s;ine&s;s to a fair End, by very moderate Conde&s;cen&s;ions; for the
univer&s;al Prejudice and Aver&s;ion was to the Queen, how unju&s;tly and un|rea&s;onably
&s;oever; and to the King only as it was generally believed, that
He governed him&s;elf entirely by her Dictates; and many of tho&s;e, who&s;e
Countenance had mo&s;t &s;upported the violent Party, by their Concurrence
with them, were grown weary of tho&s;e Exce&s;&s;es; and as they had been
&s;educed, and craftily drawn farther than they meant to have gone, &s;o they<MILESTONE N="20">
plainly di&s;cerned that there would be farther Attempts made, than were
agreeable to their Wi&s;hes, or their Intere&s;ts; and therefore re&s;olved to &s;e|cond
them no farther.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> him&s;elf was in his Nature an hone&s;t Man, and a
Man of Honour; and though He did not think the King had any gracious
Purpo&s;es towards him, or great Confidence in him, yet he was willing to
retire from that angry Company; and did neither de&s;ire the Dignity of
the King &s;hould be affronted; or the Government receive an Alteration,
or Diminution; and did hope nothing more, than to make him&s;elf the In|&s;trument
to reconcile the Parliament to the King, by &s;ome moderate and<MILESTONE N="30">
plau&s;ible Expedient. But it was no &s;ooner known in the Hou&s;es, that his
Maje&s;ty was gone to <HI>Theobalds,</HI> and had taken the Prince with him, with
a Purpo&s;e of making a Progre&s;s farther Northward; but They fell into all
their u&s;ual Heat, and Debate, of their ju&s;t Cau&s;es of Jealou&s;y and Di&s;tru&s;t,
and the Wickedne&s;s of tho&s;e Per&s;ons who mi&s;led him; and the next Morn|ing,
being well informed that the King &s;taid all Day at <HI>Theobalds,</HI> They
re&s;olved to &s;end a Committee of four Lords, and eight Commoners to him,
to put him in mind of his violating their Privileges, for which They had
yet no Reparation or Satisfaction; his Refu&s;al to &s;ettle the Militia, where|by
He left his Kingdom and People expo&s;ed to the Violence of a Foreign<MILESTONE N="40">
Enemy, or a dome&s;tick In&s;urrection; the great Jealou&s;ies, and Fears which
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Minds of all his Subjects; which would be now exceedingly
increa&s;ed by his Removal in this Conjuncture from his Parliament; and
thereupon concluded, that He would return to <HI>London,</HI> or re&s;ide at &s;uch
a Di&s;tance, that They might ea&s;ily repair to him.</P>
<P>WHEN the Per&s;ons de&s;igned for the Me&s;&s;age withdrew to prepare them|&s;elves
for their Journey, the Me&s;&s;age being read and agreed upon,
Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> went likewi&s;e out of the Hou&s;e; and that the King might not
be &s;urprized with the &s;ight of the Me&s;&s;age before He heard of it, he &s;ent
in&s;tantly to the Lord <HI>Grandi&s;on</HI> (in whom He had entire Confidence) to<MILESTONE N="50">
&s;peak with him; and de&s;ired him to cau&s;e his Hor&s;e to be made ready,
that He might with all po&s;&s;ible Expedition carry a Letter to the King,
which He would prepare by the Time He could be ready for the Journey.
<PB N="57" REF="64">
He writ to the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Advice to the King upon a Me&s;&s;age from the two Hou&s;es.</NOTE> that &s;uch Per&s;ons would be pre&s;ently with him; and
the Sub&s;tance of the Me&s;&s;age They would bring to him; which in Re&s;pect
of the Length of it, and of many Particulars in it, would require &s;ome
Time to an&s;wer, which He &s;hould receive &s;oon enough; and for the
pre&s;ent, He might upon the Delivery, make &s;ome &s;hort Re&s;entment of the
Hou&s;es proceeding with him; and conclude, that He would &s;end an An|&s;wer
to their Me&s;&s;age in due Time. The Lord <HI>Grandi&s;on</HI> came to <HI>Theo|balds</HI>
when the King had newly dined, &s;o that He was alone in his Bed|chamber;
and as &s;oon as He had delivered the Letter, He returned to
<MILESTONE N="10"><HI>London,</HI> and met the Me&s;&s;engers within a Mile or two of <HI>Theobalds.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as They had delivered their Me&s;&s;age, which one of them read,
the King with a di&s;plea&s;ed Countenance, and in a warmer, and more
&s;prightly Tone than was natural to him, told them, &startq;that He was amazed
at their Me&s;&s;age, and could not conceive what They would have, nor
what They meant to do: that They made a great Noi&s;e with their Pri|vileges,
but forgot that He had Privileges too, which They made no
Con&s;cience to violate: that They talked of their Fears, and Jealou&s;ies,
for which They had not the lea&s;t Ground; but if They would well
con&s;ider, They would find that They gave him Cau&s;e enough for Jea|lou&s;y:&endq;
<MILESTONE N="20">and concluded, &startq;that He would think of their Me&s;&s;age, and &s;end
an An&s;wer to the Hou&s;es in convenient Time:&endq; without &s;aying any
Thing of his Journey, when or whither He meant to go; nor held any
farther Di&s;cour&s;e with them. The Manner, and the Matter of the King's
&s;hort Di&s;cour&s;e to them, wonderfully &s;urpri&s;ed the Me&s;&s;engers, who were
all Per&s;ons of the be&s;t Quality in both Hou&s;es, the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI>
being the Chief, and &s;ome of them were of known Affections to his Ma|je&s;ty's
Service; who were wonderfully delighted with the King's quick,
and &s;harp Treatment, with which the re&s;t were as much troubled: and
&s;o They all returned the &s;ame Night to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30">THE King re&s;olved to pur&s;ue the Cour&s;e agreed upon with the Queen
at her Departure; and would no more re&s;ume the Con&s;ideration of &s;taying
nearer the Parliament: very rea&s;onably apprehending, that He &s;hould
render him&s;elf liable every Day to new Affronts. And the Practice both
Hou&s;es had gotten, to &s;end for Per&s;ons by a Serjeant at Arms, upon any
Sugge&s;tions of light Di&s;cour&s;e, or upon general, and ungrounded Su&s;picions,
by which They were compelled to give long Attendance, if They were
not committed to Pri&s;on, had &s;o terrified all Conditions of Men, that very
few re&s;orted to the Court. And They who did mo&s;t diligently &s;eem to at|tend
their Duty there, did in truth perform that Service, that They might
<MILESTONE N="40">with the more Ea&s;e betray their Ma&s;ter, and gratify tho&s;e, who They
thought would at la&s;t bring them&s;elves into tho&s;e Places and Offices, upon
which They were to depend. So that He thought it mo&s;t ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary
to be at &s;uch a di&s;tance from <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> that People might be le&s;s
apprehen&s;ive of their Power: re&s;olving likewi&s;e, that no Per&s;on who at|tended
him, or re&s;orted to the Place where He was, &s;hould yield any
Obedience to their Summons, upon tho&s;e general Sugge&s;tions; or any Ap|plications
they &s;hould make to his Maje&s;ty. And though it might have met
with better Succe&s;s if he had taken the contrary Re&s;olution, and &s;taid in,
or near <HI>Whitehall;</HI> yet the Hazards, or Inconveniences which might very
<MILESTONE N="50">probably have attended that Coun&s;el, were too much in View, for wi&s;e Men
to engage po&s;itively in the Advice. Be&s;ides, the Concert that had been
made with the Queen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King be|gins his Pro|gre&s;s North|ward.</NOTE> &s;hut out all oppo&s;ite Con&s;ultations: and the King
with a &s;mall Court, after two Days &s;tay at <HI>Theobalds,</HI> began his Progre&s;s
<PB N="58" REF="65">
toward <HI>Newmarket;</HI> and &s;ometimes re&s;ting a Day in a Place, He advanced
by ea&s;y Journeys Northward.</P>
<P>HE took the Prince with him, the Marquis likewi&s;e attending him;
but left the Duke of <HI>York</HI> &s;till at <HI>Richmond,</HI> till He came to <HI>York:</HI> and
then likewi&s;e He &s;ent for his Highne&s;s, who came thither to him: and the
Morning He left <HI>Theobalds,</HI> He &s;ent his An&s;wer to the two Hou&s;es, to
their Me&s;&s;age They had &s;ent to him thither.</P>
<P>THEY had long dete&s;ted and &s;u&s;pected Mr. <HI>Hyde,</HI> from the Time of
their fir&s;t Remon&s;trance, for framing the King's Me&s;&s;ages, and An&s;wers,
which They now every Day received, to their intolerable Vexation; yet<MILESTONE N="10">
knew not how to accu&s;e him. But now that the Earls of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and <HI>Hol|land</HI>
had di&s;covered his being &s;hut up with the King at <HI>Greenwich;</HI> and
the Marquis of <HI>Hamilton</HI> had once before, found him very early in Private
with the King at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> at a Time when the King thought all Pa&s;&s;ages
had been &s;topped; together with his being of late more Ab&s;ent from the
Hou&s;e, than He had u&s;ed to be; and the Re&s;ort of the other Two every
Night to his Lodging as is mentioned before, &s;atisfied them that He was
the Per&s;on; and They re&s;olved to di&s;enable him to manage that Office
long. Sir <HI>John Colepepper</HI> had as many Eyes upon them, as They had
upon the other, and an equal Animo&s;ity again&s;t them; and had Familia|rity<MILESTONE N="20">
and Friend&s;hip with &s;ome Per&s;ons, who from the &s;econd or third Hand
came to know many of the greate&s;t De&s;igns, before they were brought
upon the Stage. For though They managed tho&s;e Councils with the
greate&s;t Secrecy, and by few Per&s;ons, which amounted to no more than
pure De&s;igns in Speculation; yet when any Thing was to be tran&s;acted
in Publick by the Hou&s;e, They were obliged, not only to prepare tho&s;e,
of whom They were them&s;elves confident, but to allow tho&s;e Confidents to
communicate it to others, in whom They confided: and &s;o Men who did
not concur with them, came to know &s;ometimes their Intentions, Time
enough to prevent the Succe&s;s they propo&s;ed to them&s;elves.<MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>AND by this Means Sir <HI>John Colepepper</HI> meeting at Night with the
Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hyde,</HI> a&s;&s;ured them, that it had been re&s;olved
that Day to have &s;eized upon all Three,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A De&s;ign of &s;ending Mr.</HI> Hyde <HI>to the</HI> Tower;</NOTE> and &s;ent them to the Tower: of
which He having received Notice as He was going to the Hou&s;e, returned
to his Lodging; not being able to give the &s;ame Information to the other
Two; but that his own being ab&s;ent prevented the Mi&s;chief. For He knew
it was re&s;olved the Night before, that when the Three were together in
the Hou&s;e, Somebody &s;hould move the Hou&s;e, &startq;that they would apply
them&s;elves to make &s;ome &s;trict Enquiry after the Per&s;ons, who were mo&s;t
like to give the King the evil Coun&s;el he had lately followed; and who<MILESTONE N="40">
prepared tho&s;e An&s;wers and Me&s;&s;ages They received from his Maje&s;ty;&endq;
upon which by one, and another tho&s;e three Per&s;ons &s;hould be named,
and particular Rea&s;ons given for their Su&s;picion; and that They did not
doubt, but if their Friends were well prepared before hand, They &s;hould
be able to cau&s;e them to be all &s;ent to the <HI>Tower;</HI> and then They doubted
not They &s;hould be able to keep them there. But it was then likewi&s;e
agreed that They would not make the Attempt, but at a Time when
They were all Three in the Hou&s;e; upon hearing whereof, and finding
that They Two were there, He went back to his Lodging; knowing that
thereupon there would be Nothing done.<MILESTONE N="50"></P>
<P>UPON this Communication,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Defeated.</NOTE> though They were all of Opinion that the
De&s;ign was &s;o extravagant, and exceeding all the Rules of common
Ju&s;tice, that They would not be able to procure the Con&s;ent of the major
<PB N="59" REF="66">
Part of the Hou&s;e in it, if there were any con&s;iderable Number pre&s;ent;
yet becau&s;e very many u&s;ually ab&s;ented them&s;elves; and They were not
governed by any Rules which had been formerly ob&s;erved; They thought
fit to re&s;olve that One of them would be always pre&s;ent in the Hou&s;e, that
They might know all that was done; but that They would never be there
altogether; and &s;eldom two of them; and when They were, They would
only hear, and &s;peak no more than was of ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity. For it was
now grown a very difficult Thing for a Man who was in their Disfavour,
to &s;peak again&s;t what They propo&s;ed, but that They would find &s;ome Ex|ception
<MILESTONE N="10">to &s;ome Word or Expre&s;&s;ion; upon which, after He had been
called upon to explain, He was obliged to withdraw, and then They had
commonly a major Part to &s;end him to the <HI>Tower,</HI> or to expel him the
Hou&s;e; or at lea&s;t to oblige him to receive a Reprehen&s;ion at the Bar upon
his Knees. And &s;o They had u&s;ed Sir <HI>Ralph Hopton</HI> at that Time; who ex|cepting
to &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ion that was u&s;ed in a Declaration prepared by a
Committee, and pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e, which He &s;aid was di&s;honourable
to the King, They &s;aid, it was a Tax upon the Committee; cau&s;ed him to
withdraw; and committed him to the <HI>Tower;</HI> which terrified many from
&s;peaking at all; and cau&s;ed more to ab&s;ent them&s;elves from the Hou&s;e;
<MILESTONE N="20">where too &s;mall numbers appeared any Day. The&s;e Three Gentlemen kept
the Re&s;olution agreed upon, till They all found it nece&s;&s;ary to forbear any
farther Attendance upon the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>ABOUT the End of <HI>April,</HI> which was in the Year 1642. Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> re|ceived
a Letter from the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Hyde <HI>is &s;ent for by the King to</HI> York.</NOTE> wherein He required him, that as &s;oon as
He could be &s;pared from his Bu&s;ine&s;s there, He &s;hould repair to his Ma|je&s;ty
at <HI>York,</HI> where He had Occa&s;ion for his Service: which when He had
communicated to his two Friends, They were all of Opinion, that it was
nece&s;&s;ary He &s;hould defer that Journey for &s;ome Time; there being every
Day great Occa&s;ion of con&s;ulting together, and of &s;ending Di&s;patches to
<MILESTONE N="30">the King. And it was a wonderful Expedition that was then u&s;ed between
<HI>York,</HI> and <HI>London,</HI> when Gentlemen undertook the Service, as enough
were willing to do: in&s;omuch, as when They di&s;patched a Letter on <HI>Sa|turday</HI>
Night, at that time of the Year, about twelve at Night, they re|ceived
always the King's An&s;wer, <HI>Monday</HI> by ten of the Clock in the
Morning. His Maje&s;ty was content that He &s;hould &s;tay as long as the
Nece&s;&s;ity required; but that as &s;oon as He might be di&s;pen&s;ed with, He
would expect him. And it was happy that He did &s;tay, for there was an Oc|ca&s;ion
then fell out, in which his Pre&s;ence was very u&s;eful,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of the Rebellion, Folio. Vol. I. p. 444, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>towards di&s;|po&s;ing

his Maje&s;ty; which Re&s;olution being taken,</HI> it was agreed between him and
his two Friends, that it was now Time that He &s;hould be gone (the King
having &s;ent for him &s;ome Time before) after a Day or two; in which
Time the Declaration of the 19th of <HI>May</HI> would be pa&s;&s;ed, which being
very long, He might carry with him; and prepare the An&s;wer upon the
Way, or after He came to <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>IT was upon a <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> that He re&s;olved to begin his Journey;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Toward which He be|gins his Jour|ney.</NOTE>
having told the Speaker, that it was very nece&s;&s;ary, by the Advice of his
Phy&s;ician, that He &s;hould take the Air of the Country for his Health;
<MILESTONE N="50">and his Phy&s;ician certified the &s;ame; which Caution was nece&s;&s;ary: For
He had a Week or two before made a Journey into the Country to his own
Hou&s;e; and his Ab&s;ence being taken Notice of, a Me&s;&s;enger was imme|diately
<PB N="60" REF="67">
&s;ent to him, to require him immediately to attend the Hou&s;e;
upon which He found it nece&s;&s;ary to return without Delay; and was
willing to prevent the like &s;udden Enquiry; and &s;o prepared the Speaker
to an&s;wer for him. He re&s;olved with the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> to &s;tay at a
Friend's Hou&s;e near <HI>Oxford,</HI> and little out of the Road he meant to take
for <HI>York,</HI> till he &s;hould hear of the Keeper's Motion, of which He pro|mi&s;ed
to give him timely Notice; not giving in the mean Time any Cre|dit
to his purpo&s;e of moving; but he was quickly convinced.</P>
<P>MUCH Notice had been taken of Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI>'s frequent Re&s;ort to him;
and of his being often &s;hut up with him; and when He took his Leave of<MILESTONE N="10">
him, the Night before He left the Town, the Keeper was walking in his
Garden with Mr. <HI>Hollis,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Glyn;</HI> who had (as They &s;aid) then ob|&s;erved,
that as &s;oon as the Keeper's Eyes were upon him, at his Entrance
into the Garden, He had &s;hewn &s;ome Impatience to be free from them;
and when They were gone, others took Notice (for there were many in
the Garden) as They pretended, that after They had walked &s;ome Time
together, They took their Leave of each other in another Manner
than was u&s;ual; and which was not True. But He had not &s;o good a
Name, as that any Thing of that Kind would not ea&s;ily gain Belief: &s;o
that Dr. <HI>Morley</HI> (who is &s;ince Bi&s;hop of <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI>) being in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI><MILESTONE N="20">
Hall on the <HI>Monday</HI> Morning when the News came of the Lord Keeper's
Flight; a Per&s;on of great Authority in the Parliament met him, and
with great Pa&s;&s;ion inveighing again&s;t the Keeper, told him that They
knew well enough that his Friend Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> had contrived that Mi&s;chief,
and brought it to pa&s;s; for which He would be that Morning, or the
next, accu&s;ed of High Trea&s;on; which the Doctor (who was ever very
much his Friend) hearing, went pre&s;ently to the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> and told
him of it, and de&s;ired to know where He was, that He might give him
timely Notice of it; knowing a Gentleman a very near Friend of his, who
would immediately ride to Him. The Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> was then writing to<MILESTONE N="30">
him to inform him of the Keeper's having made good his Word, of which
he had but then Notice; and to advi&s;e him to pro&s;ecute his northern
Journey with all Expedition; and de&s;ired the Doctor that He would &s;end
for the Gentleman, whom He would pre&s;ently direct where He &s;hould
find Mr. <HI>Hyde;</HI> who did make &s;o good Ha&s;te, that He delivered the Lord
<HI>Falkland</HI>'s Letter to him early the &s;ame Night.</P>
<P>HE was then at <HI>Ditchley</HI> with the Lady <HI>Lee</HI> (&s;ince Counte&s;s of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI>)

with the Way, having never been in the northern Parts, and ap|prehended
that there would be Care taken to intercept him if He went in
any common Road, there was with him at that Time Mr. <HI>Chillingworth,</HI>
who&s;e Company He had de&s;ired from <HI>Oxford,</HI> purpo&s;ely for that Occa|ca&s;ion;

there being many Rea&s;ons that He &s;hould be concealed in tho&s;e Parts, as
long as might be convenient. <HI>No&s;tall</HI> was within twenty Miles of <HI>York;</HI>
and from thence He gave his Maje&s;ty Notice of his being there; and &s;ent

the Declaration of the twenty &s;ixth of <HI>May,</HI> and which was the highe&s;t
They had yet publi&s;hed; and to which He wi&s;hed an An&s;wer &s;hould be
prepared as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible it might be, that the Poi&s;on thereof might not
work too long upon the Minds of the People.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as it was taken Notice of in the Parliament that Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI>
was ab&s;ent, Enquiry was made, what was become of him, and a Motion
made in the Hou&s;e, that He might be &s;ent for. The Speaker &s;aid, that He
had acquainted him with his going into the Country to recover his Indi&s;|po&s;ition
<MILESTONE N="20">which troubled him, by fre&s;h Air; and that Dr. <HI>Win&s;ton</HI> his Phy|&s;ician
was with him, and informed him, that He was troubled with the
Stone; and that his having &s;at &s;o much in the Hou&s;e, in that very hot
Weather had done him much Harm; and therefore that He had advi&s;ed
him to refre&s;h him&s;elf in the Country Air; with which Te&s;timony They
were for the pre&s;ent &s;atisfied; though Mr. <HI>Peard</HI> &s;aid confidently, &startq;that
He was troubled with no other Stone, than the Stone in his Heart; and
therefore He would have him &s;ent for wherever He was; for He was
mo&s;t confident that He was doing them Mi&s;chief, wherever he was.&endq;
But He prevailed not, till their Committee from <HI>York</HI> &s;ent them Word,
<MILESTONE N="30">that He was come thither, and almo&s;t always with the King. It is &s;aid
before, that He &s;taid at <HI>No&s;tall</HI> at the Hou&s;e of Sir <HI>John Wor&s;tenholme,</HI>
from whence He &s;ent every Day to the King, and received his Maje&s;ty's
Commands; and He intended to have &s;taid longer there, where He could
better intend, and di&s;patch any Bu&s;ine&s;s He was to do; and He was willing
for &s;ome Time not to be &s;een at <HI>York,</HI> which He knew would quickly be
taken Notice of at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN He came fir&s;t thither, He found that the King was not &s;ati&s;|fied
with the Lord Keeper, which gave him much Trouble; his Maje&s;ty
having &s;ent him Word that He did not like his Humours, nor know what
<MILESTONE N="40">to make of him. Mr. <HI>Elliot</HI> who had brought the Seal to the King, to
magnify his own Service, and not imagining that the Keeper intended to
follow him, had told many Stories; as if the Keeper had refu&s;ed to deli|ver
the Seal, and that He got it by Force, by having locked the Door
upon him, and threatened to kill him, if He would not give it to him,
which upon &s;uch his Manhood He did for pure Fear con&s;ent unto. And his
Tale got &s;o much Credit with the King that He hardly di&s;believed it,
when He came him&s;elf, though it was in the Nature of it very improbable,
that a &s;ingle Man, by another Man as &s;trong as him&s;elf (who was attended
by many Servants in the next Room) &s;hould be &s;uffered to &s;hut the Door
<MILESTONE N="50">upon him, and to extort that from him, which He had no Mind to part
with; and afterwards to go out of his Hou&s;e, when there were Per&s;ons
enough in every Room to have laid Hands upon him, and to have taken
That again by Force, which He had ravi&s;hed away. Be&s;ides that his Ma|je&s;ty
<PB N="62" REF="69">
knew He expected to be &s;ent for at that Time; and that if He had
repented the Promi&s;e He had made, and re&s;olved not to perform it, He
could have found &s;everal Ways to have evaded it; and refu&s;ed to have ad|mitted
Mr. <HI>Elliot</HI> to &s;peak with him: But the Prejudice his Maje&s;ty had
before contracted again&s;t him, and the great Confidence <HI>Elliot</HI> had in the
Relation, which was natural in him, had &s;hut out all tho&s;e Reflections.
Yet when his Maje&s;ty &s;aw him, He received him graciou&s;ly; and cau&s;ed
him to be lodged in the Court, in a Room very near his Maje&s;ty; which
many believed to be rather out of Jealou&s;y and Care that he &s;hould not again
return, than out of Re&s;pect to him; his Maje&s;ty keeping &s;till the Seal<MILESTONE N="10">
him&s;elf, and not re&s;toring it to his Cu&s;tody; which could not but make
&s;ome Impre&s;&s;ion on him, and more on others, who from thence concluded
that He would have no more to do with the Seal; and carried them&s;elves
towards him accordingly.</P>
<P>THE Lords who were come from the Hou&s;e of Peers, and had been
offended at his Behaviour there, gave him little Re&s;pect now; but rather
gave Credit to Mr. <HI>Elliot's</HI> Relation; and were forward to make Rela|tion
of his Carriage in the Hou&s;e to his Di&s;advantage, to the King him|&s;elf;
&s;o that it was no Wonder that the poor Gentleman grew very Me|lancholick.
And when He was &s;ent for to attend the King (who was him|&s;elf<MILESTONE N="20">
pre&s;ent when the Great Seal was to be u&s;ed; nor did ever &s;uffer it to
be u&s;ed but in the Pre&s;ence of the Keeper, who &s;igned all Things as He
ought to do by his Office) when any Proclamation of Trea&s;on, as that
again&s;t the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> or again&s;t the Proceedings of the Hou&s;es, as in
the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Militia, or the like, was brought to be &s;ealed, He u&s;ed
all Delays; and made many Exceptions; and found Faults in Matters of
Form, and otherwi&s;e, &s;ometimes very rea&s;onably; yet in &s;uch a Manner,
as made it evident He retained many Fears about him, as if He was not
without Apprehen&s;ion that He might fall again into their Hands; which
was the Cau&s;e that the King had &s;aid, that He knew not what to make<MILESTONE N="30">
of him.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Hyde,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Hyde <HI>writes from</HI> No&s;tall <HI>to the King.</HI></NOTE> as &s;oon as He heard this, wrote a Letter to the King; and
put him in Mind of all that had formerly pa&s;&s;ed in that Affair: how ab|&s;olutely
the Keeper had de&s;troyed him&s;elf in the Account of the Parlia|ment,
by paying that Obedience which He ought to do to his Maje&s;ty's
Commands; and that if He &s;hould be deprived of his Maje&s;ty's Favour,
He mu&s;t be of all Men the mo&s;t mi&s;erable; and that him&s;elf &s;hould be mo&s;t
unfortunate, in having contributed &s;o much to his Ruin: which would
call his Maje&s;ty's Good Nature, and even his Ju&s;tice into Que&s;tion; and
therefore be&s;ought him to be Gracious to him, and to keep up his Spirits<MILESTONE N="40">
with his Countenance. However He made it his own humble Suit to his
Maje&s;ty, that He would not take any &s;evere Re&s;olution again&s;t him, be|fore
He gave him leave to ki&s;s his Hand, and to offer him &s;ome farther
Con&s;iderations. Upon the Receipt of this Letter, the King &s;ent him Word,
that He would gratify him in the la&s;t part of his Letter, and conclude No|thing
before He &s;pake with him: in the mean Time He wi&s;hed him to
&s;end the Keeper &s;ome good Coun&s;el; and that as &s;oon as He &s;hould have
di&s;patched &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s He had then upon his Hands, that He would
come to <HI>York,</HI> where He would find much to do; and that He thought
now, there would be le&s;s Rea&s;on every Day for his being concealed. And<MILESTONE N="50">
within four or five Days after, his Maje&s;ty &s;ent Mr. <HI>A&s;hburnbam</HI> to him to
let him know, that He had every Day &s;o much to do with the Keeper,
and found him &s;o refractory and ob&s;tinate, that He &s;hould not be able
<PB N="63" REF="70">
to keep the Promi&s;e He had made to him, if He did not make Ha&s;te to
<HI>York;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And goes from thence to</HI> York.</NOTE> and therefore bade him to be with him with all Convenience:
Whereupon, within two Days after, for He had &s;omewhat to di&s;patch that
required Ha&s;te, and &s;ooner than He intended, He waited upon his Ma|je&s;ty
at <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN He came to the Court, being about four of the Clock in the
Afternoon, the King was at Council, upon the publi&s;hing his An&s;wer to
the Declaration of the twenty &s;ixth of <HI>May;</HI> which though it contained
eight or nine Sheets of Paper, He brought to the Board in his own Hand
<MILESTONE N="10">writing; having kept the Promi&s;e He had made at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> to that
Hour, in writing out all the Papers him&s;elf, which had been &s;ent to him;
which had been a wonderful Ta&s;k He had impo&s;ed on him&s;elf: &s;o that
He always &s;pent more than half the Day &s;hut up by him&s;elf in his Cham|ber,
Writing; which was mo&s;t of the News the Hou&s;es heard of him at
<HI>London;</HI> and which perplexed them very much.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Hyde</HI> was in the Gallery when the King came from Council;<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Reception there;</NOTE> and
as &s;oon as He &s;aw him, He bade him Welcome to <HI>York</HI> very graciou&s;ly;
and a&s;ked &s;ome Que&s;tions aloud of him, as if He thought He had then come
from <HI>London;</HI> and then called him into the Garden, where He walked
<MILESTONE N="20">with him above an Hour.<NOTE PLACE="marg">and Conver&s;a|tion with the King.</NOTE> He &s;aid at the beginning, &startq;that They needed
not now be afraid of being &s;een together;&endq; then u&s;ed all the Expre&s;|&s;ions
of Kindne&s;s to him that can be imagined, of the Service He had
done him; and of the great Benefit He had received from it; even to the
turning the Hearts of the whole Nation towards him again; and of his gra|cious
Re&s;olutions of rewarding him with the fir&s;t Opportunity; and many
Expre&s;&s;ions of that Kind; which the other received with the Mode&s;ty and
Reverence that became him. Then his Maje&s;ty &s;pake of his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and
the Temper of that Country; and quickly entered upon finding Fault
with the Keeper, and prote&s;ted, if it were not for his Sake, He would
<MILESTONE N="30">turn him out of his Place that very Hour; and enlarged upon many Par|ticulars
of his Ob&s;tinacy, and of his Want of Courage, to &s;uch a Degree,
as if He did really apprehend, that the Gentleman U&s;her of the Black Rod
would come and take him out of his Chamber.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Hyde</HI> told him, that he would di&s;courage many good Men, who
de&s;ired to &s;erve him very faithfully, if He were too &s;evere for &s;uch Faults
as the Infirmities of their Nature, and Defects in their Education, expo&s;ed
them to: That if the Keeper, from tho&s;e Impre&s;&s;ions, had committed &s;ome
Faults which might provoke his Maje&s;ty's Di&s;plea&s;ure, He had redeemed
tho&s;e Errors by a &s;ignal Service, which might well wipe out the Memory
<MILESTONE N="40">of the other. The King &s;aid with &s;ome Warmth, &startq;that He was &s;o far
from another Opinion, that He would hate him&s;elf if He did not believe
that He had made a full Expiation; and though He did think that He
had been wrought upon by <HI>him</HI> to perform that Part; yet He thought
the Merit of it far above any of his Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; and that He was
di&s;po&s;ed from the fir&s;t Minute of his coming to <HI>York,</HI> to have renewed
his old Kindne&s;s to him, and Confidence in him; and would willingly
have given the Seal again into his Hands, if He had found He had de&s;ired
it: but that He found no Serenity in his Countenance; nor any Incli|nation
to do what Nece&s;&s;ity required: and whereas the Parliament took
<MILESTONE N="50">Advantage, that none of his Maje&s;ty's Acts which He had cau&s;ed to be
publi&s;hed, were Authentick, nor ought to be looked upon as his, be|cau&s;e
the Great Seal had not been affixed to them, which could not be
done whil&s;t the Great Seal was at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter;</HI> now He had the Seal by
<PB N="64" REF="71">
him, and &s;ent Proclamations to be &s;ealed, the Keeper was &s;till as un|willing
that they &s;hould pa&s;s, as if He was &s;till under their Power;
which made him angry, and Nothing that He had done before.&endq;</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Hyde</HI> replied, that &startq;the poor Gentleman could not but think
him&s;elf di&s;obliged to the highe&s;t Extremity, in the Pre&s;umption of
Mr. <HI>Elliot;</HI> and that his extravagant, and in&s;olent Di&s;cour&s;es &s;hould
find Credit, without his Maje&s;ty's Reprehen&s;ion, and Vindication, who
knew the Fal&s;hood of them.&endq; And &s;o put his Maje&s;ty in Mind of all that
had pa&s;&s;ed; and of the other Circum&s;tances, which made all the other's
Brags impo&s;&s;ible to be True. For his Fears and Apprehen&s;ions, He be|&s;ought<MILESTONE N="10">
his Maje&s;ty to remember, that &startq;He had newly e&s;caped out of that
Region, where the Thunder and Lightening is made; and that He
could hardly yet recover the Fright He had been often in, and &s;een &s;o
many others in; and that his Maje&s;ty need not di&s;tru&s;t him, He had
pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Rubicon,</HI> and had no Hope but in his Maje&s;ty.&endq; His Ma|je&s;ty
concluded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whom He re|conciles to the Lord Keeper.</NOTE> that He &s;hould be &s;ure to receive all nece&s;&s;ary Counte|nance,
and Protection from him, of which He bade him to a&s;&s;ure him,
and pre&s;ently to vi&s;it him, which going to do, He met him in the Gar|den,
and They there walked together.</P>
<P>HE found him full of Apprehen&s;ion that He &s;hould be put out of his<MILESTONE N="20">
Place; and of the Ruin, and Contempt that He &s;hould be then expo&s;ed
to, which He had brought upon him&s;elf; but when the other an&s;wered
him, that there was no Danger of that; and told him all that had pa&s;&s;ed
between the King and Him; and that if He would, He might have the
Seal in his own Cu&s;tody again within an Hour; He was exceedingly re|vived,
and de&s;ired him to intreat the King to keep the Great Seal &s;till
him&s;elf; that He would by no Means be an&s;werable for the Safety of it;
nor would tru&s;t any Servant of his own to look to it; which as it was
wi&s;ely con&s;idered, and re&s;olved by him, &s;o it increa&s;ed the King's Confi|dence
in him; who would have been troubled if the other had accepted<MILESTONE N="30">
the Grace that was offered. And from that Time, when any Thing was
to be done, that admini&s;tered any Argument for Doubt, Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> always
prepared him by Di&s;cour&s;e; &s;o that there was never after any Unkindne&s;s
from the King towards him; but the Vigour of his Mind grew every Day
le&s;s under a great Melancholy that oppre&s;&s;ed him, from the Con&s;ideration
of the Time, and of his own ill Condition in his Fortune; which was
much wor&s;e than any Body imagined it could be.</P>
<P>BEFORE He went out of the Garden, the Lord <HI>Howard,</HI> Sir <HI>Hugh
Cholmely,</HI> and Sir <HI>Philip Stapleton</HI> (who were the Committee from the Par|liament)
had Intelligence that He was walking in the Garden with the<MILESTONE N="40">
King; whereupon They came pre&s;ently thither, and after They had &s;a|luted
him with much Civility, They &s;hewed him an In&s;truction They had
from the Parliament; by which They were required, if any Member of
either Hou&s;e came to <HI>York,</HI> They &s;hould let them know, that it was the
Plea&s;ure of the Hou&s;e that They &s;hould immediately attend the Hou&s;e;
and &s;ignify to them what An&s;wer They made;<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is &s;um|moned to at|tend the Par|liament: $span$.</NOTE> and &s;o They de&s;ired He
would excu&s;e them for doing their Duty. He told them, He was but ju&s;t
then come thither in Obedience to his Maje&s;ty's Commands, and knew
not yet what Service He was to do; but that as &s;oon as his Maje&s;ty would
give him Leave, He would return to the Parliament.<MILESTONE N="50"></P>
<P>THERE happened an Accident, at Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI>'s fir&s;t coming to <HI>York,</HI>
which He u&s;ed often to &s;peak of, and to be very merry at. One of the
King's Servants had provided a Lodging for him, &s;o that when He alighted
<PB N="65" REF="72">
at the Court, He &s;ent his Servants thither, and &s;taid him&s;elf at the Court
'till after Supper, and 'till the King went into his Chamber; and then He
had a Guide, who went with him, and conducted him to his Chamber;
which he liked very well, and began to undre&s;s him&s;elf. One of his Ser|vants
wi&s;hed that He had any other Lodging, and de&s;ired him not to lie
there; He a&s;ked why, it &s;eemed to him a good Chamber: his Servant
an&s;wered, that the Chamber was good, but the People of the Hou&s;e the
wor&s;t He ever &s;aw, and &s;uch, as He was confident would do him &s;ome
Mi&s;chief: at which wondering, his Servant told him, that the Per&s;ons of
<MILESTONE N="10">the Hou&s;e &s;eemed to be of &s;ome Condition by their Habit, that was very
good; and that the Servants when They came thither, found the Ma&s;ter
and Mi&s;tre&s;s in the lower Room, who received them civilly, and &s;hewed
them the Chamber where their Ma&s;ter was to lodge; and wi&s;hed them to
call for any Thing They wanted, and &s;o left them: That &s;hortly after,
one of them went down, and the Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Hou&s;e being again in the
lower Room, where it &s;eems &s;he u&s;ually &s;at, She a&s;ked him, what his
Ma&s;ter's Name was, which He told her; what &s;aid She, that <HI>Hyde</HI> that
is of the Hou&s;e of Commons? and He an&s;wering yes, She gave a great
Shriek, and cried out, that He &s;hould not lodge in her Hou&s;e; cur&s;ing
<MILESTONE N="20">him with many bitter Execrations. Upon the Noi&s;e her Hu&s;band came
in, and when She told him who it was that was to lodge in the Chamber
above, He &s;wore a great Oath that He &s;hould not; and that He would
rather &s;et his Hou&s;e on Fire, than entertain him in it. The Servant &s;tood
amazed, knowing that his Ma&s;ter had never been in, or near that City;
and de&s;ired to know what Offence He had committed again&s;t them; He
told them He was confident his Ma&s;ter did not know them, nor could be
known to them. The Man an&s;wered after two or three Cur&s;es, that He
knew him well enough, and that He had undone him, and his Wife, and
his Children; and &s;o after repeating &s;ome new bitter Cur&s;es, He concluded,
<MILESTONE N="30">that He would &s;et his Hou&s;e on Fire as &s;oon as the Other &s;hould &s;et his
Foot in it; and &s;o He, and his Wife went away in a great Rage into an
inner Room, and clapped the Door to them.</P>
<P>WHEN his Servant had made this Relation to him, He was no le&s;s &s;ur|prized;
knew not what to make of it; a&s;ked whether the People were
drunk, was a&s;&s;ured that They were very &s;ober, and appeared before this
Pa&s;&s;ion to be well bred. He &s;ent to de&s;ire the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e to come
to him, that They might confer together, and that He would immediately
depart his Hou&s;e if He de&s;ired it. He received no An&s;wer, but that He
and his Wife were gone to Bed: upon which He &s;aid no more, but that, if
<MILESTONE N="40">They were gone to Bed, He would go to Bed too, and did accordingly.
Though He was not di&s;turbed in the Night, the Morning was not at all
calmer; the Ma&s;ter and the Mi&s;tre&s;s &s;tormed as much as ever; and
would not be per&s;uaded to &s;peak with him: but He then under&s;tood the
Rea&s;on: the Man of the Hou&s;e had been an Attorney in the Court of the
Pre&s;ident and Council of the North, in great Reputation and Practice
there; and thereby got a very good Livelihood, with which He had lived
in Splendor; and Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> had &s;at in the Chair of that Committee, and
had carried up the Votes of the Commons again&s;t that Court, to the Hou&s;e
of Peers, upon which it was di&s;&s;olved: which He confe&s;&s;ed was a better
<MILESTONE N="50">Rea&s;on for being angry with him, than many others had, who were as
angry, and per&s;ecuted him more. However, He thought him&s;elf obliged
to remove the Eye-&s;ore from them, and to quit the Lodging that had been
a&s;&s;igned to him; and He was much better accommodated by the Kindne&s;s
<PB N="66" REF="73">
of a good Prebendary of the Church, Dr. <HI>Hod&s;hon,</HI> who &s;ent to in|vite
him to lodge in his Hou&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He re&s;ides at</HI> York <HI>with Dr.</HI> Hod&s;hon.</NOTE> as &s;oon as He heard He was come to
Town; where He re&s;ided as long as the Court &s;taid there.</P>
<P>THERE was now a great Conflux of the Members of both Hou&s;es of
Parliament to <HI>York;</HI> in&s;omuch as there remained not in the Hou&s;e of
Commons above a fifth Part of the whole Number; and of the Hou&s;e of
Peers &s;o few, that there continued not at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> twenty Lords. Yet
They proceeded with the &s;ame Spirit, and Pre&s;umption, as when their
Numbers were full; publi&s;hed new Declarations again&s;t the King; rai&s;ed
Soldiers for their Army apace; and executed their Ordinance for the Mi|litia<MILESTONE N="10">
in all the Counties of <HI>England,</HI> the northern Parts only excepted;
forbad all Per&s;ons to re&s;ort to the King; and intercepted many in their
Journey towards <HI>York,</HI> and committed them to Pri&s;on: notwith&s;tanding
which, many Per&s;ons of Quality every Day flocked thither; and it was
no longer &s;afe for tho&s;e Members to &s;tay in the Hou&s;es of Parliament, who
re&s;olved not to concur with them in their unwarrantable De&s;igns; and
therefore the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> and Sir <HI>John Colepepper</HI> &s;hortly after repaired
likewi&s;e to <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the King declared that He would go to <HI>Beverley,</HI> a Place with|in
four Miles of <HI>Hull,</HI> the Noi&s;e of the King's Journey thither made a<MILESTONE N="20">
great Impre&s;&s;ion upon the Parliament. Where, how great a Concurrence
&s;oever there was, in tho&s;e unwarrantable Actions which begot the War;
yet a &s;mall Number of tho&s;e who voted, both the rai&s;ing the Army, and
making the General, did in Truth intend, or believe that there would
be a War: and therefore when They looked upon it as begun in this
March of the King's to <HI>Hull</HI> (for They con&s;idered their own Actions as
done only to prevent a War, by making the King unable to make it, who
as They thought only de&s;ired it) they moved pre&s;ently for &s;ome Overtures
of an Accommodation. Which that angry Party that re&s;olved again&s;t it,
never dur&s;t ab&s;olutely reject; but con&s;enting chearfully to it, got thereby<MILESTONE N="30">
Authority to in&s;ert &s;uch Things in the Addre&s;s, as mu&s;t inevitably render
it ineffectual. So, at this Time They &s;ent the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> a Per&s;on
whom They knew to be mo&s;t unacceptable to the King, with two Mem|bers
of the Hou&s;e of Commons, who came to <HI>Beverley</HI> the Day the King
arrived there. The Subject of their Me&s;&s;age was, after &s;everal &s;pecious
Expre&s;&s;ions, and Profe&s;&s;ions of their Duty, to di&s;&s;uade his Maje&s;ty from
making War again&s;t his Parliament, by proceeding in his Enterprize again&s;t
<HI>Hull,</HI> which the Parliament was obliged to defend. And all the Expe|dient
They propo&s;ed for the avoiding this War was, that He would con|&s;ent
to the nineteen Propo&s;itions, which They had formerly made to him<MILESTONE N="40">
at <HI>York,</HI> and to which He had long &s;ince returned his An&s;wer; and both
the one and the other were printed.</P>
<P>THESE nineteen Propo&s;itions, which contained the Di&s;inheri&s;on of the
Crown of all its choice Regalities, and left only the Shadow and empty
Name of the King, had been framed by the Hou&s;es after Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> left
<HI>London.</HI> And becau&s;e He had &s;o much Work then upon his Hands, as They
believed He would not be able to di&s;patch &s;oon enough, the Lord <HI>Falk|land,</HI>
and Sir <HI>John Colepepper</HI> undertook to prepare an An&s;wer to them
them&s;elves; and &s;o divided the Propo&s;itions between them; and in a &s;hort
Time &s;o fini&s;hed their An&s;wer that They &s;ent it to the King, and de&s;ired<MILESTONE N="50">
that Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> might peru&s;e it, and then cau&s;e it to be publi&s;hed and
printed. The An&s;wer was full to all Particulars; and writ with very much
Wit and Sharpne&s;s; but there were &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions in it, which He liked
<PB N="67" REF="74">
not, as prejudicial to the King, and in Truth a Mi&s;take in Point of Right,
in that Part which had been prepared by Sir <HI>John Colepepper;</HI> who had
taken it up upon Credit, and without weighing the Con&s;equence, did
really believe that it had been True; which was, that in the Di&s;cour&s;e
of the Con&s;titution of the Kingdom, He had declared, that the <HI>King</HI>
and <HI>the Hou&s;e of Peers,</HI> and <HI>the Hou&s;e of Commons</HI> made the <HI>Three
E&s;tates:</HI> and for this Rea&s;on Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> did not advance the Printing it;
and told the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Hyde <HI>advi&s;es the King not to publi&s;h the An&s;wer to the Parliament's nineteen Pro|po&s;itions.</HI></NOTE> that all the Particulars in tho&s;e Propo&s;itions had been
enough an&s;wered in former An&s;wers to other Declarations (which was true)
<MILESTONE N="10">and therefore that this needed not be publi&s;hed: with which his Maje&s;ty
was &s;atisfied, without knowing the particular true Rea&s;on; which He
thought not fit to communicate, for both the Per&s;ons &s;akes, of who&s;e Af|fection
for the Church (which was principally concerned in that Mi&s;take,
&s;ince in Truth the Bi&s;hops make the <HI>Third E&s;tate,</HI> the King being the
Head, and Sovereign of the Whole) his Maje&s;ty was always jealous.</P>
<P>BUT They no &s;ooner came to <HI>York,</HI> than They appeared much un&s;a|tisfied,
that that An&s;wer was not printed: and the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> finding
it remained &s;till in Mr. <HI>Hyde's</HI> Hands, He expo&s;tulated warmly with him
of the Rea&s;ons;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lord</HI> Falk|land'<HI>s Expol|tulation with him thereon.</HI></NOTE> and in &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ion &s;aid, &startq;He therefore di&s;liked it be|cau&s;e
<MILESTONE N="20">He had not writ it him&s;elf.&endq; Upon which, without &s;aying more
than that, &startq;He never expected &s;o unkind a Reproach from him,&endq; He
delivered the written Copy to him, and He immediately procured the
King's Con&s;ent, and &s;ent it to the Pre&s;s that Night, with Order to lo&s;e
no Time in the Impre&s;&s;ion. Of which the King was afterwards very &s;en|&s;ible;
and that Excellent Lord, who intended not the lea&s;t Unkindne&s;s
(nor did it produce the lea&s;t Interruption in their Friend&s;hip) was likewi&s;e
much troubled when He knew the Rea&s;on; and imputed it to his own
Inadvertency, and to the Infu&s;ion of &s;ome Lawyers who had mi&s;led Sir
<HI>John Colepepper;</HI> and to the Declarations which many of the Prelatical
<MILESTONE N="30">Clergy frequently, and ignorantly made, that the Bi&s;hops did not fit in
Parliament, as the Repre&s;entatives of the Clergy, and &s;o could not be the
<HI>Third E&s;tate.</HI></P>
<P>IT happened that the Day the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> came to <HI>Beverley,</HI>
Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> had been riding Abroad; and returning to <HI>Beverley,</HI> happened
to be in the &s;ame Road, when the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> and his Company
pro&s;ecuted their Journey to the King: when meeting together, there
pa&s;&s;ed the u&s;ual Salutations which are between Per&s;ons well known to each
other.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Hyde'<HI>s Conver&s;ation with the Earl of</HI> Holland.</NOTE> &startq;He hoped (the Earl &s;aid) that He &s;hould be Welcome to all ho|ne&s;t
Men at the Court, becau&s;e He came to invite the King to return
<MILESTONE N="40">to his Parliament; and to aboli&s;h all Jealou&s;ies between them.&endq; The
other an&s;wered, &startq;He would be very Welcome indeed, if He brought
proper Expedients to produce either of tho&s;e Effects: but then his Er|rand
mu&s;t be of another Compo&s;ition, than what the King under&s;tood
it to be.&endq; Upon which They entered upon a warmer Di&s;cour&s;e than it
may be either of them intended; and as the Earl &s;pake in another Stile
than He had u&s;ed to do, of the Power and Authority of the Parliament,
and how much They were &s;uperior to any Oppo&s;ition or Contradiction; &s;o
the Other in the Debate was le&s;s re&s;erved, and kept a le&s;s Guard upon
him&s;elf than He u&s;ed to do; &s;o that They &s;eemed nothing plea&s;ed with
<MILESTONE N="50">each other: nor did Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> vi&s;it him after his coming to <HI>Beverley,</HI> be|cau&s;e
He was informed that the Earl had to many Per&s;ons who re&s;orted
to him, repeated with &s;ome Liberty and Sharpne&s;s, what had pa&s;&s;ed be|tween
them; and not without &s;ome Menaces what the Parliament would
<PB N="68" REF="75">
do. And as &s;oon as He did return, there was a new Vote pa&s;&s;ed by
Name again&s;t him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is exempt|ed from Par|don by a Vote of the Hou&s;es.</NOTE> and Two or Three more, by which He was exempted
from Pardon in any Accommodation that &s;hould be made between the
King, and Parliament.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Hyde</HI> had been ab&s;ent four or five Days from the Court; and
came into the Pre&s;ence when the King was wa&s;hing his Hands before Din|ner;
and as &s;oon as the King &s;aw him, He a&s;ked him aloud, &startq;<HI>Ned
Hyde</HI> when did you play with my Band&s;trings la&s;t?&endq; upon which He
was exceedingly out of Countenance, not imagining the Cau&s;e of the
Que&s;tion, and the Room being full of Gentlemen, who appeared to be<MILESTONE N="10">
Merry with what the King had a&s;ked. But his Maje&s;ty ob&s;erving him to
be in Di&s;order, and to blu&s;h very much, &s;aid plea&s;antly, &startq;be not trou|bled
at it, for I have worn no Band&s;trings the&s;e twenty Years:&endq; and then
a&s;ked him whether He had not &s;een the Diurnal; of which He had not
heard till then, but, &s;hortly after, &s;ome of the Standers-by &s;hewed him a
Diurnal, in which there was a Letter of Intelligence printed, where it was
&s;aid, that <HI>Ned Hyde</HI> was grown &s;o familiar with the King, that He u&s;ed
to play with his Band&s;trings. Which was a Method of calumniating They
began then, and &s;hortly after pro&s;ecuted and exerci&s;ed upon much greater
Per&s;ons.<MILESTONE N="20"></P>
<P>IN the Afternoon the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> came to deliver his Me&s;&s;age with
great Formality: whom the King received with much Coldne&s;s, and Ma|nife&s;tation
of Neglect; and when the Earl approached, and kneeled to
ki&s;s his Hand, He turned or withdrew his Hand in &s;uch a Manner, that
the Earl ki&s;&s;ed his own. When the Me&s;&s;age was read, the King &s;aid little
more, than that They &s;hould not &s;tay long for an An&s;wer; and &s;o went
to his Chamber. The Earl was not without many Friends there, and &s;ome
of them moved the King, that He would give him Leave to &s;ay &s;ome|what
to him in Private, which They believed would be very much for his
Service; but his Maje&s;ty would by no Means yield to it. By this Time<MILESTONE N="30">
his Maje&s;ty had Notice of the Governor's Irre&s;olution at <HI>Hull;</HI> and &s;o was
glad of this Opportunity to have a fair Excu&s;e for making no Attempt
upon that Place. And &s;ent the next Day for the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> to receive
his An&s;wer; which being read aloud in the King's Pre&s;ence, and a full
Room, by the Clerk of the Council, was very grateful to the Auditors,
who feared &s;ome Conde&s;cen&s;ion in the King; though very mortifying to
the Earl. For be&s;ides that it was thought very &s;harp towards the Hou&s;es,
it declared his Brother the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> a Traitor, for po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf
of the King's Fleet again&s;t his Con&s;ent; and concluded, that He
would forbear any Attempt upon <HI>Hull</HI> for fourteen Days; in which Time,<MILESTONE N="40">
if the Parliament would enter into a Treaty for a happy Peace, They &s;hould
find him very well inclined to it; after the expiration of that Time He
&s;hould pur&s;ue tho&s;e Ways which He thought fit. In the mean Time, He
made a &s;hort Progre&s;s into the adjacent Counties of <HI>Nottingham</HI> and <HI>Lei|ce&s;ter,</HI>
to &s;ee what Countenance They wore; and to encourage tho&s;e, who
appeared to have good Affections to his Service: And then returning to
<HI>Beverley</HI> within the limited Time, and hearing no more from the Parlia|ment,
or any Thing from <HI>Hull</HI> that He expected, He returned again to
<HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>MR. <HI>Hyde</HI> was wont often to relate a Pa&s;&s;age in that melancholick<MILESTONE N="50">
Time, when the Standard was &s;et up at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> with which He was
much affected. Sir <HI>Edmund Varney,</HI> Knight-Mar&s;hal, who was mentioned
<PB N="69" REF="76">
before as Standard Bearer, with whom He had great Familiarity, who
was a Man of great Courage, and generally beloved, came one Day to
him and told him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Conver&s;a|tion with Sir</HI> Edmund Varney.</NOTE> &startq;He was very glad to &s;ee him in &s;o univer&s;al a Damp,
under which the Spirits of mo&s;t Men were oppre&s;&s;ed, retain &s;till his na|tural
Vivacity and Chearfulne&s;s; that He knew that the Condition of the
King, and the Power of the Parliament, was not better known to any
Man than to him; and therefore He hoped that He was able to admi|ni&s;ter
&s;ome Comfort to his Friends, that might rai&s;e their Spirits, as
well as it &s;upported his own.&endq; He an&s;wered, &startq;that He was in Truth be|holden
<MILESTONE N="10">to his Con&s;titution, which did not incline him to De&s;pair; other|wi&s;e,
that He had no plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect before him, but thought as ill
of Affairs as mo&s;t Men did; that the other was as far from being me|lancholick
as He, and was known to be a Man of great Courage (as in|deed
He was of a very cheerful, and a generous Nature, and con|fe&s;&s;edly
Valiant) and that They could not do the King better Service,
than by making it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to rai&s;e the dejected Minds of Men;
and root out tho&s;e Apprehen&s;ions which di&s;turbed them, of Fear and
De&s;pair, which could do no Good, and did really much Mi&s;chief.&endq;</P>
<P>HE replied &s;miling, &startq;I will willingly join with you the be&s;t I can,
<MILESTONE N="20">but I &s;hall act it very &s;curvily. My Condition, <HI>&s;aid He,</HI> is much wor&s;e
than yours, and different I believe from any other Man's, and will very
well ju&s;tify the Melancholick that, I confe&s;s to you, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es me. You
have Satisfaction in your Con&s;cience that you are in the Right; that the
King ought not to grant what is required of him; and &s;o you do your
Duty, and your Bu&s;ine&s;s together: But for my Part, I do not like the
Quarrel, and do heartily wi&s;h that the King would yield and con&s;ent to
what They de&s;ire; &s;o that my Con&s;cience is only concerned in Honour,
and in Gratitude to follow my Ma&s;ter. I have eaten his Bread, and
&s;erved him near thirty Years, and will not do &s;o ba&s;e a Thing, as to for|&s;ake
<MILESTONE N="30">him; and chu&s;e rather to lo&s;e my Life (which I am &s;ure I &s;hall do)
to pre&s;erve and defend tho&s;e Things, which are again&s;t my Con&s;cience
to pre&s;erve and defend. For I will deal freely with you, I have no Re|verence
for the Bi&s;hops, for whom this Quarrel &s;ub&s;i&s;ts.&endq; It was not a
Time to Di&s;pute; and his Affection to the Church had never been &s;u&s;|pected.
He was as Good as his Word; and was killed in the Battle of
<HI>Edgehill,</HI> within two Months after this Di&s;cour&s;e. And if tho&s;e who had
the &s;ame and greater Obligations, had ob&s;erved the &s;ame Rules of Grati|tude,
and Genero&s;ity, whatever their other Affections had been, that
Battle had never been fought, nor any of that Mi&s;chief been brought to
<MILESTONE N="40">pa&s;s, that &s;ucceeded it.</P>
<P>AFTER the King came to <HI>Oxford</HI> with his Army, his Maje&s;ty one Day
&s;peaking with the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> very graciou&s;ly concerning Mr. <HI>Hyde,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King's Wager with Lord</HI> Falk|land <HI>concern|ing Mr.</HI> Hyde'<HI>s Style.</HI></NOTE>
&s;aid He had &s;uch a peculiar Stile, that He could know any Thing written
by him, if it were brought to him by a Stranger, among&s;t a Multitude of
Writings by other Men. The Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> an&s;wered, He doubted his
Maje&s;ty could hardly do that; becau&s;e He him&s;elf, who had &s;o long Con|ver&s;ation
and Friend&s;hip with him, was often deceived; and o&s;ten met
with Things written by him, of which He could never have &s;u&s;pected
him, upon the variety of Arguments. To which the King replied, He would
<MILESTONE N="50">lay him <HI>an Angel,</HI> that let the Argument be what it would, He &s;hould
never bring him a Sheet of Paper (for He would not undertake to judge of
le&s;s) of his Writing, but He would di&s;cover it to be his. The Lord <HI>Falk|land</HI>
told him it &s;hould be a Wager; but neither the one or the other
<PB N="70" REF="77">
ever mentioned it to Mr. <HI>Hyde.</HI> Some Days after the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI>
brought &s;everal Packets, which He had then received from <HI>London,</HI> to
the King, before He had opened them, as he u&s;ed to do: and after He
had read his &s;everal Letters of Intelligence, He took out the Prints of
Diurnals, and Speeches, and the like, which were every Day printed at
<HI>London,</HI> and as con&s;tantly &s;ent to <HI>Oxford:</HI> and among&s;t the re&s;t there
were two Speeches, the one made by the Lord <HI>Pembroke</HI> for an Accommo|dation;
and the other by the Lord <HI>Brooke</HI> again&s;t it, and for the carrying on
the War with more Vigour, and utterly to root out the Cavaliers, which
were the King's Party.<MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>THE King was very much plea&s;ed with reading the Speeches, and &s;aid,
He did not think that <HI>Pembroke</HI> could &s;peak &s;o long together; though every
Word He &s;aid was &s;o much his own, that no Body el&s;e could make it. And
&s;o after He had plea&s;ed Him&s;elf with reading the Speeches over again, and
then pa&s;&s;ed to other Papers, the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> whi&s;pered in his Ear (for
there were other Per&s;ons by) de&s;iring him He would pay him <HI>the Angel;</HI>
which his Maje&s;ty in the In&s;tant apprehending, blu&s;hed, and put his Hand
in his Pocket, and gave him <HI>an Angel,</HI> &s;aying, He had never paid a Wa|ger
more willingly: and was very merry upon it, and would often call
upon Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> for a Speech, or a Letter, which He very often prepared upon<MILESTONE N="20">
&s;everal Occa&s;ions; and the King always commanded them to be printed.
And He was often wont to &s;ay many Years after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He laments the Lo&s;s of Many of his occa&s;ional Writings.</NOTE> that He would be very
glad He could make a Collection of all tho&s;e Papers, which he had writ|ten
occa&s;ionally at that Time; which He could never do, though He got
many of them.</P>
<P>THERE was at that Time a plea&s;ant Story upon tho&s;e Speeches. The
Lord <HI>Brooke</HI> had met with them in print; and heard that he was much
reproached for &s;o Unchri&s;tian a Speech again&s;t Peace;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Di&s;pute cau&s;ed by one of them.</NOTE> though the Lan|guage
was &s;uch as He u&s;ed in all Opportunities: whereupon one Morning
in the Hou&s;e of Peers, and before the Hou&s;e fate, He came to the Earl of<MILESTONE N="30">
<HI>Portland</HI> (who yet remained there with the King's Approbation, and
knew well enough from whence the Speeches came, having him&s;elf cau&s;ed
them to be printed) and &s;hewing them to him, de&s;ired He would move
the Hou&s;e, that that Speech might, by their Order, be burned by the
Hand of the Hangman; by which Means the Kingdom would be in|formed,
that it had never been &s;poken by him. The Earl &s;aid He would
willingly do him the Service; but He ob&s;erved that the Speeches were
printed in that Manner, that where the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI>'s Speech ended
on the one Side of the Leaf, his (the Lord <HI>Brooke</HI>'s) Speech began on the
other Side, &s;o that one could not be burned, without burning the other<MILESTONE N="40">
too; which He knew not how the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> would like; and
therefore He dur&s;t not move it without his Con&s;ent. Whereupon They
both went to the Earl, who was then likewi&s;e in the Hou&s;e, and <HI>Port|land</HI>
told him what the Lord <HI>Brooke</HI> de&s;ired, and asked him whether He
wi&s;hed it &s;hould be done. He, who heard He was very well &s;poken of,
for having &s;poke &s;o hone&s;tly for Peace, &s;aid, He did not de&s;ire it. Upon
which <HI>Brooke</HI> in great Anger, a&s;ked if He had ever made that Speech;
He was very &s;ure He had never made the other; and the other with equal
Choler replied, that He was always for Peace; and though He could not
&s;ay He had &s;poken all tho&s;e Things together, He was &s;ure He had &s;poken<MILESTONE N="50">
them all at &s;everal Times; and that He knew as well, that He had al|ways
been again&s;t Peace, and had often u&s;ed all tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions which
were in the Speech, though it may be not all together. Upon which They
<PB N="71" REF="78">
entered into a high Combat of reproachful Words again&s;t each other, to
the no &s;mall Delight of the Earl, who had brought them together, and of
the re&s;t of the Standers by.</P>
<P>THE King was no &s;ooner &s;ettled in his Winter Quarters, after his Re|treat
from <HI>Brentford</HI> to <HI>Oxford,</HI> but the Parliament &s;ent to him for a Safe-Conduct,
for Commi&s;&s;ioners to be &s;ent from them to treat of Peace;
which was &s;ent to them. And at this Time there was a Change in
Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI>'s Fortune, by a Preferment the King conferred upon him.
Every Body knew that He was tru&s;ted by the King in his mo&s;t &s;ecret Tran&s;|actions;
<MILESTONE N="10">but He was under no Character in his Service. When the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners
who were &s;ent for the Safe-Conduct came to <HI>Oxford,</HI> &s;ome who
came in their Company, among&s;t other Matters of Intelligence brought
the King a Letter of his own to the Qu&eacute;en, printed, that had been inter|cepted,
and printed by the Licence, if not Order, of the Parliament. In
this Letter, of the &s;afe Conveyance whereof his Maje&s;ty had no Apprehen|&s;ion,
the King had lamented the Unea&s;ine&s;s of his own Condition, in re|&s;pect
of the daily Importunity which was made to him by the Lords and
others, for Honours, Offices, and Preferments; and named &s;everal Lords,
who were &s;olicitous by them&s;elves, or their Friends, for this, and that Place;
<MILESTONE N="20">in all which He de&s;ired to receive the Queen's Advice, being re&s;olved to do
Nothing with Reference to tho&s;e Pretences, till He &s;hould receive it. But
He &s;aid there were &s;ome Places, which He mu&s;t di&s;po&s;e of without &s;tay|ing
for her An&s;wer, the Nece&s;&s;ity of his Service requiring it; which were
the Ma&s;ter&s;hip of the Wards; Applications being &s;till made to the Lord
<HI>Say</HI> in tho&s;e Affairs, and &s;o that Revenue was diverted from him: and
therefore as He had revoked his Patent, &s;o He was re&s;olved to make Secre|tary
<HI>Nicholas</HI> Ma&s;ter of the Wards, and then (the&s;e were his Maje&s;ty's own
Words) I mu&s;t make <HI>Ned Hyde</HI> Secretary of State, for the Truth is, I can
tru&s;t no Body el&s;e. Which was a very envious Expre&s;&s;ion, and extended
<MILESTONE N="30">by the ill Interpretation of &s;ome Men, to a more general Comprehen&s;ion
than could be intended. This was quickly made Publick, for there were
&s;everal Prints of it in many Hands; and &s;ome Men had Rea&s;on to be trou|bled
to find their Names mentioned in that Manner, and others were glad
that theirs were there, as having the Pretence to pur&s;ue their Importuni|ties
the more vehemently, being, as the Phra&s;e was, brought upon the
Stage, and &s;hould &s;uffer much in their Honour if They &s;hould be now re|jected;
which Kind of Argumentation was very unagreeable and grievous
to the King.</P>
<P>ONE Morning, when the King was walking in the Garden, as He u&s;ed
<MILESTONE N="40">to do,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Hyde <HI>declines the Office of Se|cretary of State.</HI></NOTE> Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> being then in his View, his Maje&s;ty called him, and di&s;|cour&s;ed

finding by his Countenance that He under&s;tood not the Meaning, He a&s;ked
him, &startq;whether He had not heard a Letter of his, which He writ to the
Queen, had been intercepted and printed.&endq; And He an&s;wering, that &startq;He

for, <HI>He &s;aid,</HI> He was re&s;olved that Afternoon to &s;wear him Secretary of

communicated in that Manner: but that He was much more &s;urprized
to find his own Name in it, and his Maje&s;ty's Re&s;olution upon it, which
<PB N="72" REF="79">
He be&s;ought him to change; for as He never had the Ambition to
hope, or wi&s;h for that Place, &s;o He knew He was very unfit for it, and
unable to di&s;charge it.&endq; To which the King with a little Anger replied,
that &startq;He did the greate&s;t Part of the Bu&s;ine&s;s now:&endq; and he an&s;wered,
that &startq;what He did now, would be no Part of the Bu&s;ine&s;s, if the Rebel|lion
were ended; and that his Un&s;kilfulne&s;s in Languages, and his not
under&s;tanding foreign Affairs, rendered him very incapable of that
Tru&s;t.&endq; The King &s;aid, &startq;He would learn as much as was nece&s;&s;ary of
that Kind very quickly.&endq; He continued his De&s;ire, that his Maje&s;ty
would lay a&s;ide that Thought; and &s;aid, &startq;that He had great Friend&s;hip<MILESTONE N="10">
for Secretary <HI>Nicholas,</HI> who would be undone by the Change; for He
would find that his Maje&s;ty would receive very Little, and He Nothing,
by that Office, till the Troubles were compo&s;ed.&endq; The King &s;aid, &startq;<HI>Ni|cholas</HI>
was an hone&s;t Man, and that his Change was by his De&s;ire;&endq; and
bade him &s;peak with him of it; which He went pre&s;ently to do, leaving
his Maje&s;ty un&s;atisfied with the Scruples He had made.</P>
<P>WHEN He came to the Secretary's Lodging, He found him with a
chearful Countenance, and embracing him, called him his Son. Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI>
an&s;wered him, that &startq;it was not the Part of a good Son to undo his Fa|ther,
or to become his Son that He might undo him:&endq; and &s;o they en|tered<MILESTONE N="20">
upon the Di&s;cour&s;e; the one telling him what the King had re|&s;olved,
and how grateful the Re&s;olution was to him; and the other in|forming
him of the Conference He had then had with the King, and that
for his Sake as well as his own, He would not &s;ubmit to the King's Plea|&s;ure
in it. And &s;o He debated the whole Matter with him; and made it
evident to him, that He would be di&s;appointed in any Expectation He
&s;hould entertain of Profit from the Wards, as the State of Affairs then
&s;tood: &s;o that He &s;hould relinqui&s;h an honourable Employment, which
He was well acquainted with, for an empty Title with which He would
have Nothing to do: and &s;o advi&s;ed him to con&s;ider well of it, and of<MILESTONE N="30">
all the Con&s;equences of it, before He expos'd him&s;elf to &s;uch an Incon|venience.</P>
<P>WHILST this was in Su&s;pen&s;e, Sir <HI>Charles Cae&s;ar,</HI> who with great Pre|judice
to the King, and more Reproach to the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,
Laud,</HI> had been made Ma&s;ter of the Rolls, died: and Sir <HI>John Colepepper</HI>
had long had a Promi&s;e from the King of that Place, when it &s;hould be|come
void, and now pre&s;&s;ed the Performance of it: which was violently
oppo&s;ed by Many, partly out of ill Will to him (for He had not the Fa|culty
of getting him&s;elf much loved) and as much out of good Husbandry,
and to &s;upply the King's Nece&s;&s;ities with a good Sum of Money, which<MILESTONE N="40">
Dr. <HI>Duck</HI> was ready to lay down for the Office. And the King was &s;o far
wrought upon, that He paid down three thou&s;and Pounds in Part of what
He was to give; but his Maje&s;ty cau&s;ed the Money to be repaid, and re|&s;olved
to make good his Promi&s;e to Sir <HI>John Colepepper,</HI> who would by no
means relea&s;e him. This was no &s;ooner declared, than the Lord <HI>Falk|land</HI>
(who was much more &s;olicitous to have Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> of the Council,
than He was him&s;elf for the Honour) took an Opportunity to tell the
King, that He had now a good Opportunity to prefer Mr. <HI>Hyde,</HI> by
making him Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the Place of Sir <HI>John Cole|pepper;</HI>
which the King &s;aid, He had re&s;olved to do, and bid him take<MILESTONE N="50">
no Notice of it, until He had told him &s;o him&s;elf. And &s;hortly after &s;ent
for him, and &s;aid, &startq;that He had now found an Office for him, which
<PB N="73" REF="80">
He hoped He would not refu&s;e:<NOTE PLACE="marg">But accepts that of Chan|cellor of the Exchequer.</NOTE> That the Chancellor&s;hip of the Ex|chequer
was void by the Promotion of <HI>Colepepper;</HI> and that He re|&s;olved
to confer it upon him;&endq; with many gracious Expre&s;&s;ions of the
Satisfaction He had in his Service. The other an&s;wered, &startq;that though it
was an Office much above his Merit, yet He did not de&s;pair of enabling
him&s;elf by Indu&s;try to execute it, which He would do with all Fi|delity.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as this was known, no Man was &s;o much troubled at it as
Sir <HI>John Colepepper,</HI> who had in Truth an Intention to have kept both
<MILESTONE N="10">Places, until He &s;hould get into the quiet Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Rolls. And
though He profe&s;&s;ed much Friend&s;hip to the other, He had no Mind He
&s;hould be upon the &s;ame Level with him; and believed He would have
too much Credit in the Council. And &s;o delayed, after his Patent for the
Rolls was pa&s;&s;ed, to &s;urrender that of the Chancellor&s;hip of the Exchequer,
until the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> expo&s;tulated very warmly
with him upon it, and until the King took Notice of it; and then,
&s;eeming very much troubled that any Body &s;hould doubt the Integrity of
his Friend&s;hip to Mr. <HI>Hyde,</HI> to whom He made all the Profe&s;&s;ions ima|ginable,
He &s;urrendered his Office of Chancellor of the Exchequer: and
<MILESTONE N="20">the next Day Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> was &s;worn of the Privy-Council,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is &s;worn of the Privy Council and Knighted.</NOTE> and Knighted,
and had his Patents &s;ealed for that Office. And the King, after He ro&s;e
from the Council, and after many Expre&s;&s;ions, of the Content He took
him&s;elf in the Obligation He had laid upon him, with much Grace, that
was not natural in him upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions, told him, that &startq;He was
very fortunate, becau&s;e He verily believed no Body was angry at his
Preferment; for be&s;ides that the Earl of <HI>Dor&s;et</HI> and others, who He
knew loved him, had expre&s;&s;ed much Satisfaction in the King's Purpo&s;e;
<HI>He &s;aid,</HI> the Lord <HI>Maltrevers,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Dun&s;more,</HI> who He did
not think had any Acquaintance with him, &s;eemed very much plea&s;ed
<MILESTONE N="30">with him; and therefore He thought no Body would envy him; which
was a rare Felicity.&endq; But his Maje&s;ty was therein mi&s;taken; for He had
great Enviers, of many who thought He had run too fa&s;t; e&s;pecially of
tho&s;e of his own Profe&s;&s;ion, who looked upon them&s;elves as his Superiors
in all Re&s;pects, and did not think that his Age (which was not then above
thirty three) or his other Parts, did entitle him to &s;uch a Preference before
them. And the News of it at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> exceedingly offended Tho&s;e
who governed in the Parliament; to &s;ee the Man whom They mo&s;t hated,
and whom They had voted to be incapable of Pardon, to be now preferred
to an Office the Chief of them looked for. Be&s;ides, there was another un|u&s;ual
<MILESTONE N="40">Circum&s;tance accompanied his Preferment, that it was without the
Interpo&s;ition, or Privity of the Queen, which was not like to make it the
more ea&s;y, and advantageous; and it was not the more unwelcome to him
from that Circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all the Di&s;cour&s;e of, and Inclination to a Treaty,
the Armies were not quiet on either Side. The King's Quarters were en|larged
by the taking of <HI>Marlborough</HI> in <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> and of <HI>Cirence&s;ter</HI> in
<HI>Gloce&s;ter&s;hire;</HI> which though untenable by their Situation, and weak
Fortifications, were garri&s;oned by the Parliament with great Numbers of
Men, who were all killed, or taken Pri&s;oners. And the Parliament Forces
<MILESTONE N="50">were not without Succe&s;s too; and after the Lo&s;s of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> &s;ur|prized
the Regiment of Hor&s;e, that was commanded by the Lord <HI>Gran|di&s;on,</HI>
a gallant Gentleman, who if not betrayed, was unhappily invited to
<HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> with Promi&s;e of Forces ready to defend the Place; which be|ing

in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> and compelled to become, all, Officers

Officers, by the Negligence, or Corruption of their Guard, made
their E&s;cape in the Night, and returned to <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>THIS was the State of the Kingdom, of the King, and of the Par|liament,
in the beginning of the Year 1643, at the Time when Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI>
was made of the Privy Council, and Chancellor of the Exchequer: which

<HEAD>PART the THIRD.</HEAD>
<P>IT was about the Beginning of <HI>March</HI> (which by that Account was
about the end of the Year 1642, and about the Beginning of the
Year 1643) that the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Parliament came to <HI>Ox|ford,</HI>
to treat with his Maje&s;ty; and were received graciou&s;ly by him;
and by his Order lodged conveniently, and well accommodated in all
Re&s;pects.</P>
<P>THE Parliament had bound up their Commi&s;&s;ioners to the &s;tricte&s;t Let|ter
of their Propo&s;itions; nor did their In&s;tructions at this Time (which
They pre&s;ented to the King) admit the lea&s;t Latitude to them to interpret
<MILESTONE N="10">a Word or Expre&s;&s;ion, that admitted a doubtful Interpretation. In&s;omuch
as the King told them, &startq;that He was &s;orry that They had no more Tru&s;t
repo&s;ed in them; and that the Parliament might as well have &s;ent their
Demands to him by the common Carrier, as by Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;o re|&s;trained.&endq;
They had only twenty Days allowed them to fini&s;h the whole
Treaty: whereof They might employ &s;ix Days in adju&s;ting a Ce&s;&s;ation, if
They found it probable to effect it in that Time: otherwi&s;e They were
to decline the Ce&s;&s;ation, and enter upon the Conditions of the Peace;
which if not concluded before the End of the twenty Days, They were to
give it over, and to return to the Parliament.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20">THESE Propo&s;itions, and Re&s;trictions much abated the Hopes of a
good I&s;&s;ue of the Treaty. Yet every Body believed, and the Commi&s;&s;ioners
them&s;elves did not doubt, that if &s;uch a Progre&s;s &s;hould be made in the
Treaty, that a Peace was like to en&s;ue, there would be no Difficulty in
the Enlargement of the Time: and therefore the Articles for a Ce&s;&s;ation
were the &s;ooner declined, that They might proceed in the main Bu&s;ine&s;s,
For though what was propo&s;ed by them in Order to it, was agreeable
enough to the Nature of &s;uch an Affair; yet the Time allowed for it was
&s;o &s;hort, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to make it practicable: nor could Notice
be timely given to all the Quarters on either Side, to ob&s;erve it.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30">BESIDES that, there were many Particulars in it, which the Officers
on the King's Side (who had no Mind to a Ce&s;&s;ation) formalized much
<PB N="76" REF="83">
upon: and (I know not from what unhappy Root, but) there was &s;prung
up a wonderful Aver&s;ion in the Town again&s;t a Ce&s;&s;ation. In&s;omuch as
many Per&s;ons of Quality of &s;everal Counties, whereof the Town was full,
applied them&s;elves in a Body to the King, not to con&s;ent to a Ce&s;&s;ation,
till a Peace might be concluded; alledging, that They had &s;everal Agita|tions
in their Countries, for his Maje&s;ty's, and their own Conveniencies,
which would be interrupted by the Ce&s;&s;ation; and if a Peace &s;hould not
afterwards en&s;ue, would be very mi&s;chievous. Which Sugge&s;tion, if it had
been well weighed, would not have been found to be of Importance.
But the Truth is, the King him&s;elf had no Mind to the Ce&s;&s;ation, for a<MILESTONE N="10">
Rea&s;on which &s;hall be mentioned anon, though it was never owned: and
&s;o They waved all farther Mention of the Ce&s;&s;ation, and betook them|&s;elves
to the Treaty; it being rea&s;onable enough to believe, that if both
Sides were heartily di&s;po&s;ed to it, a Peace might as &s;oon have been agreed
upon, as a Ce&s;&s;ation could be. All the Tran&s;actions of that Treaty having
been long &s;ince publi&s;hed, and being fit only to be dige&s;ted into the Hi&s;tory
of that Time, are to be omitted here. Only what pa&s;&s;ed in Secret, and was
never communicated,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Secret Tran&s;actions in the Treaty of</HI> Oxford.</NOTE> nor can otherwi&s;e be known, &s;ince at this Time, no
Man el&s;e is living who was privy to that Negotiation, but the Chancellor of
the Exchequer, will have a proper Place in this Di&s;cour&s;e.<MILESTONE N="20"></P>
<P>THE Propo&s;itions brought by the Commi&s;&s;ioners in the Treaty were &s;o
unrea&s;onable, that They well knew that the King would never con&s;ent
to them: but &s;ome Per&s;ons among&s;t them, who were known to wi&s;h well
to the King, endeavoured underhand to bring it to pa&s;s. And They did
therefore, whil&s;t They publickly pur&s;ued their In&s;tructions, and delivered,
and received Papers upon their Propo&s;itions, privately u&s;e all the Means
they could, e&s;pecially in Conferences with the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> and the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, that the King might be prevailed with, in
&s;ome Degree to comply with their unrea&s;onable Demands.</P>
<P>IN all Matters which related to the Church, They did not only de|&s;pair<MILESTONE N="30">
of the King's Concurrence, but did not in their own Judgments wi&s;h
it; and believed, that the Strength of the Party which de&s;ired the Conti|nuance
of the War, was made up of tho&s;e, who were very indifferent in
that Point; and that, if They might return with Satisfaction in other Par|ticulars,
They &s;hould have Power enough in the two Hou&s;es, to oblige
the more violent People to accept, or &s;ubmit to the Conditions. They
wi&s;hed therefore that the King would make &s;ome Conde&s;cen&s;ions in the
Point of the Militia; which They looked upon as the only &s;ub&s;tantial Se|curity
They could have, not to be called in Que&s;tion for what They had
done ami&s;s. And when They &s;aw Nothing could be dige&s;ted of that Kind,<MILESTONE N="40">
which would not reflect both upon the King's Authority, and his Honour,
They gave over in&s;i&s;ting upon the General:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Pierre|point'<HI>s Pro|po&s;ition.</HI></NOTE> and then Mr. <HI>Pierrepoint</HI> (who
was of the be&s;t Parts, and mo&s;t intimate with the Earl of <HI>Northumber|land</HI>)
rather de&s;ired than propo&s;ed, that the King would offer to grant
his Commi&s;&s;ion to the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> to be Lord High Admiral
of <HI>England.</HI> By which Conde&s;cen&s;ion He would be re&s;tored to his Office,
which He had lo&s;t for their Sakes; and &s;o their Honour would be likewi&s;e
repaired, without any &s;ignal Prejudice to the King; &s;ince He &s;hould hold
it only by his Maje&s;ty's Commi&s;&s;ion, and not by any Ordinance of Parlia|ment;
and He &s;aid, if the King would be induced to gratify them in this<MILESTONE N="50">
Particular, He could not be confident, that They &s;hould be able to pre|vail
with both Hou&s;es to be &s;atisfied therewith, &s;o that a Peace might &s;ud|denly
be concluded; but as He did not de&s;pair even of that, He did be|lieve,
<PB N="77" REF="84">
that &s;o many would be &s;atisfied with it, that They would from
thence take the Occa&s;ion to &s;eparate them&s;elves from them, as Men who
would rather de&s;troy their Country, than re&s;tore it to Peace.</P>
<P>AND the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> him&s;elf took &s;o much Notice of this
Di&s;cour&s;e to Secretary <HI>Nicholas</HI> (with whom He had as much Freedom, as
his re&s;erved Nature was capable of) as to prote&s;t to him, that He de&s;ired
only to receive that Honour, and Tru&s;t from the King, that He might be
able to do him Service; and thereby to recover the Credit He had un|happily
lo&s;t with him. In which He u&s;ed very decent Expre&s;&s;ions towards
<MILESTONE N="10">his Maje&s;ty; not without &s;uch Reflections upon his own Behaviour, as im|plied
that He was not proud of it: and concluded, that if his Maje&s;ty
would do him that Honour, as to make that Offer to the Hou&s;es, upon the
Propo&s;ition of the Militia, He would do all He could that it might be ef|fectual
towards a Peace; and if it had not Succe&s;s, He would pa&s;s his Word
and Honour to the King, that as &s;oon, or when&s;oever, his Maje&s;ty would
plea&s;e to require it, He would deliver up his Commi&s;&s;ion again into his
Hands; He having no other Ambition, or De&s;ire, than by this Means to
re-deliver up the Royal Navy to his Maje&s;ty's as ab&s;olute Di&s;po&s;al, as it was,
when his Maje&s;ty fir&s;t put it into his Hands; and which He doubted
<MILESTONE N="20">would hardly be done by any other Expedient, at lea&s;t not &s;o &s;oon.</P>
<P>WHEN this Propo&s;ition (which from the Intere&s;t, and Per&s;ons who pro|po&s;ed
it, &s;eemed to carry with it &s;ome Probability of Succe&s;s, if it &s;hould
be accepted) was communicated with tho&s;e who were like with mo&s;t Se|crecy
to con&s;ult it; Secretary <HI>Nicholas</HI> having already made &s;ome Approach
towards the King upon the Subject, and found his Maje&s;ty without Incli|nation
to hear more of it; it was agreed and re&s;olved by them, that the
Chancellor of the Exchequer &s;hould pre&s;ume to make the Propo&s;ition
plainly to the King; and to per&s;uade his Maje&s;ty to hear it debated in his
Pre&s;ence: at lea&s;t, if that might not be, to enlarge upon it him&s;elf, as
<MILESTONE N="30">much as the Argument required: and He was not unwilling to embark
him&s;elf in the Affair.</P>
<P>WHEN He found a fit Opportunity for the Repre&s;entation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which the Chancellor of the Exchequer advi&s;es the King to com|ply with.</NOTE> and his
Maje&s;ty at good Lei&s;ure, in his Morning's Walk, when He was always
mo&s;t willing to be entertained, the Chancellor related ingenuou&s;ly to him
the whole Di&s;cour&s;e, which had been made by Mr. <HI>Pierrepoint,</HI> and to
whom; and what the Earl him&s;elf had &s;aid to Secretary <HI>Nicholas;</HI> and
what Conference They, to whom his Maje&s;ty gave Leave to con&s;ult toge|ther
upon his Affairs, had between them&s;elves upon the Argument, and
what occurred to them upon it: in which He mentioned the Earl's De|merit
<MILESTONE N="40">towards his Maje&s;ty, with Severity enough, and what Rea&s;on He
had, not to be willing to re&s;tore a Man to his Favour, who had forfeited
it &s;o unworthily. Yet He de&s;ired him to con&s;ider his own ill Condition;
and how unlike it was, that it &s;hould be improved by the Continuance of
the War; and whether He could ever imagine a Po&s;&s;ibility of getting out
of it upon more ea&s;y Conditions, than what was now propo&s;ed; the Offer
of which to the Parliament could do him no &s;ignal Prejudice, and could
not but bring him very notable Advantages: for if the Peace did not en&s;ue
upon it, &s;uch a Rupture infallibly would, as might in a little Time facili|tate
the other. And then He &s;aid as much to le&s;&s;en the Malignity of the
<MILESTONE N="50">Earl as He could, by remembring, how dutifully He had re&s;igned his
Commi&s;&s;ion of Admiral, upon his Maje&s;ty's Demand; and his Refu&s;al to
accept the Commi&s;&s;ion the Parliament would have given him: and ob|&s;erved
&s;ome Vices in his Nature, which would &s;tand in the Place of Vir|tues,
<PB N="78" REF="85">
towards the Support of his Fidelity to his Maje&s;ty, and his Animo&s;ity
again&s;t the Parliament; if He were once re-ingratiated to his Maje&s;ty's
Tru&s;t.</P>
<P>THE King heard him very quietly without the lea&s;t Interruption, which
He u&s;ed not to do upon Subjects which were not grateful to him, for He
knew well, that He was not &s;wayed by any Affection to the Man; to whom
He was more a Stranger, than He was to mo&s;t of that Condition: and
He upon Occa&s;ions, had often made &s;harp Reflections upon his Ingrati|tude
to the King. His Maje&s;ty &s;eemed at the fir&s;t to in&s;i&s;t upon the Im|probability,
that any &s;uch Conce&s;&s;ion by him, would be attended with any<MILESTONE N="10">
Succe&s;s; that not only the Earl had not Intere&s;t in the Hou&s;es, to lead
them into a Re&s;olution, that was only for his particular Benefit; but that
the Parliament it &s;elf was not able to make a Peace, without &s;uch Condi|tions,
as the Army would require. And then He &s;hould &s;uffer exceedingly
in his Honour, for having &s;hewn an Inclination to a Per&s;on, who had re|quited
his former Graces &s;o unworthily: and this led him into more
Warmth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's An&s;wer.</NOTE> than He u&s;ed to be affected with. He &s;aid, &startq;indeed He had
been very unfortunate in conferring his Favours upon many very ungrate|ful
Per&s;ons: but no Man was &s;o inexcu&s;able as the Earl of <HI>Northumber|land.</HI>&endq;
He &s;aid, &startq;He knew that the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> was generally<MILESTONE N="20">
looked upon as the Man of the greate&s;t Ingratitude; but (He &s;aid) He
could better excu&s;e him than the other: that it was true, He owed all
He had to his Father's, and his Bounties; and that him&s;elf had con|ferred
great Favours upon him; but that it was as true, He had fre|quently
given him many Mortifications, which though He had de&s;erved,
He knew had troubled him very much; that He had oftener denied
him, than any other Man of his Condition; and that He had but lately
refu&s;ed to gratify him in a Suit He had made to him, of which He had
been very confident; and &s;o might have &s;ome Excu&s;e (how ill &s;oever)
for being out of Humour, which led him from one Ill to another; but<MILESTONE N="30">
that He had lived always without Intermi&s;&s;ion, with the Earl of
<HI>Northumberland</HI> as his Friend, and courted him as his Mi&s;tre&s;s; that
He had never denied any Thing He had ever a&s;ked, and therefore his
Carriage to him was never to be forgotten.&endq;</P>
<P>AND this Di&s;cour&s;e he continued with more Commotion, and in a more
pathetical Stile, than ever He u&s;ed upon any other Argument. And though
at that Time it was not fit to pre&s;s the Matter farther, it was afterwards
re&s;umed by the &s;ame Per&s;on more than once; but without any other Ef|fect,
than that his Maje&s;ty was contented, that the Earl &s;hould not de|&s;pair
of being re&s;tored to that Office, when the Peace &s;hould be made; or<MILESTONE N="40">
upon any eminent Service performed by him, when the Peace &s;hould be
de&s;paired of. The King was very willing and de&s;irous that the Treaty &s;hould
be drawn out in Length; to which Purpo&s;e a Propo&s;ition was made to the
Commi&s;&s;ioners, for an Addition of Ten Days, which They &s;ent to the Par|liament,
without the lea&s;t Apprehen&s;ion that it would be denied. But
They were deceived; and for An&s;wer received an Order upon the la&s;t Day
but one of the Time before limited, by which They were expre&s;ly re|quired,
to leave <HI>Oxford</HI> the next Day. From that Time, all Intercour&s;e
and Commerce between <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>London,</HI> which had been permitted
before, was ab&s;olutely interdicted under the highe&s;t Penalties by the Par|liament.<MILESTONE N="50"></P>
<P>IF this &s;ecret underhand Propo&s;ition had &s;ucceeded, and received that
Encouragement from the King, that was de&s;ired; and more Application
<PB N="79" REF="86">
of the &s;ame Remedies had been then made to other Per&s;ons (for alone it
could never have proved effectual) it is probable, that tho&s;e violent and
abominable Coun&s;els, which were but then in Projection between very
few Men of any Intere&s;t, and which were afterwards mi&s;erably put in
Practice, had been prevented. And it was exceedingly wondered at, by
tho&s;e who were then privy to this Overture, and by all who afterwards
came to hear of it, that the King &s;hould in that Conjuncture decline &s;o
advantageous a Propo&s;ition; &s;ince He did already di&s;cern many ill Hu|mours,
and Factions, growing, and nouri&s;hed, both in his Court and
<MILESTONE N="10">Army, which would every Day be unea&s;y to him; and did with all his
Soul de&s;ire an End of the War. And there was Nothing more &s;uitable and
agreeable to his magnanimous Nature, than to forgive tho&s;e, who had in
the highe&s;t Degree offended him: Which Temper was notorious through|out
his whole Life. It will not be therefore ami&s;s in this Di&s;cour&s;e, to en|large
upon this fatal Rejection, and the true Cau&s;e and Ground thereof.</P>
<P>THE King's Affection to the Queen was of a very extraordinary Alloy;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The true Cau&s;e of the King's reject|ing it.</NOTE>
a Compo&s;ition of Con&s;cience, and Love, and Genero&s;ity, and Gratitude,
and all tho&s;e noble Affections, which rai&s;e the Pa&s;&s;ion to the greate&s;t
Height; in&s;omuch as He &s;aw with her Eyes; and determined by her Judg|ment.
<MILESTONE N="20">And did not only pay her this Adoration, but de&s;ired that all Men
&s;hould know that He was &s;wayed by her; which was not Good for either
of them. The Queen was a Lady of great Beauty, excellent Wit and Hu|mour,
and made him a ju&s;t Return of noble&s;t Affections; &s;o that They
were the true Idea of conjugal Affection, in the Age in which They lived.
When She was admitted to the Knowledge, and Participation of the mo&s;t
&s;ecret Affairs (from which She had been carefully re&s;trained by the Duke
of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> whil&s;t He lived) She took Delight in the examining and
di&s;cu&s;&s;ing them, and from thence in making Judgment of them; in which,
her Pa&s;&s;ions were always &s;trong.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30">SHE had felt &s;o much Pain in knowing Nothing, and medling with No|thing,
during the Time of that great Favourite, that now She took Plea|&s;ure
in Nothing but knowing all Things, and di&s;po&s;ing all Things: and
thought it but ju&s;t, that She &s;hould di&s;po&s;e of all Favours and Prefer|ments,
as He had done; at lea&s;t, that Nothing of that Kind might be
done, without her Privity: not con&s;idering, that the univer&s;al Prejudice
that great Man had undergone, was not with Reference to his Per&s;on, but
his Power: and that the &s;ame Power would be equally obnoxious to Mur|mur
and Complaint, if it re&s;ided in any other Per&s;on, than the King him|&s;elf.
And She &s;o far concurred with the King's Inclination, that She did
<MILESTONE N="40">not more de&s;ire to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this unlimited Power, than that all
the World &s;hould take Notice, that She was the entire Mi&s;tre&s;s of it: which
in Truth (what other unhappy Circum&s;tances &s;oever concurred in the Mi&s;|chief)
was the Foundation upon which, the fir&s;t, and the utmo&s;t Preju|dices
to the King, and his Government, were rai&s;ed, and pro&s;ecuted. And
it was her Maje&s;ty's, and the Kingdom's Misfortune, that She had not any
Per&s;on about her, who had either Ability, or Affection, to inform and ad|vi&s;e
her, of the Temper of the Kingdom, or Humour of the People; or
who thought either worth the caring for.</P>
<P>WHEN the Di&s;turbances grew &s;o rude, as to interrupt this Harmony;
<MILESTONE N="50">and the Queen's Fears, and Indi&s;po&s;ition, which proceeded from tho&s;e
Fears, di&s;po&s;ed her to leave the Kingdom, which the King to comply with
her, con&s;ented to (and if that Fear had not been predominant in her, her
Jealou&s;y, and Apprehen&s;ion that the King would, at &s;ome Time, be pre|vailed
<PB N="80" REF="87">
with to yield to &s;ome unrea&s;onable Conditions, would have di&s;|&s;uaded
her from that Voyage) to make all Things therefore as &s;ure as
might be, that her Ab&s;ence &s;hould not be attended with any &s;uch In|convenience,
his Maje&s;ty made a &s;olemn Promi&s;e to her at parting, that He
would receive no Per&s;on into any Favour, or Tru&s;t, who had di&s;&s;erved
him, without her Privity and Con&s;ent; and that, as She had undergone &s;o
many Reproaches and Calumnies at the Entrance into the War, &s;o He
would never make any Peace, but by her Interpo&s;ition, and Mediation, that
the Kingdom might receive that Ble&s;&s;ing only from Her.</P>
<P>THIS Promi&s;e (of which his Maje&s;ty was too Religious an Ob&s;erver)<MILESTONE N="10">
was the Cau&s;e of his Maje&s;ty's Rejection, or not Entertaining this la&s;t
Overture. And this was the Rea&s;on that He had that Aver&s;ion to the
Ce&s;&s;ation; which He thought would inevitably oblige him to con&s;ent to
the Peace, as it &s;hould be propo&s;ed; and therefore He had countenanced
an Addre&s;s, that had been made to him again&s;t it, by the Gentlemen of
&s;everal Counties attending the Court: and in Truth They were put upon
that Addre&s;s by the King's own private Direction. Upon which the Chan|cellor
of the Exchequer told him, when the Bu&s;ine&s;s was over, that He
had rai&s;ed a Spirit he would not be able to conjure down: And that tho&s;e
Petitioners had now appeared in a Bu&s;ine&s;s that plea&s;ed him, but would<MILESTONE N="20">
be as ready to appear at another Time, to cro&s;s what He de&s;ired; which
proved true. For He was afterwards more troubled with Application, and
Importunity of that Kind, and the Murmurs that aro&s;e from that Liberty,
when all Men would be Coun&s;ellors, and cen&s;ure all that the Council did,
than with the Power of the Enemy.</P>
<P>ABOUT the Time that the Treaty began, the Queen landed in the
North: And She re&s;olved with a good Quantity of Ammunition, and Arms,
to make what Ha&s;te She could to the King: having at her fir&s;t landing,
expre&s;&s;ed by a Letter to his Maje&s;ty, her Apprehen&s;ion of an ill Peace by
that Treaty; and declared, that She would never live in <HI>England,</HI> if She<MILESTONE N="30">
might not have a Guard for the Security of her Per&s;on: which Letter came
accidentally afterwards into the Hands of the Parliament, of which They
made U&s;e to the Queen's Di&s;advantage. And the Expectation of her Ma|je&s;ty's
Arrival at <HI>Oxford,</HI> was the Rea&s;on that the King &s;o much de&s;ired
the Prolongation of the Treaty. And if it had plea&s;ed God that She had
come thither Time enough, as She did &s;hortly after, She would have pro|bably
conde&s;cended to many Propo&s;itions for the gratifying particular Per|&s;ons,
as appeared afterwards, if thereby a rea&s;onable Peace might have
been obtained.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners attended the King at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and<MILESTONE N="40">
de&s;ired his Leave, that there might be a Parliament called in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
which his Maje&s;ty denied them (well knowing, that They would, again&s;t
all the Prote&s;tations, and Oaths They had made to him, at his being in
that Country,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Scoti&s;h <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners pre&s;ent to the King their Reque&s;t for the Abolition of Epi&s;copacy.</HI></NOTE> join with tho&s;e at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI>) They pre&s;ented a long Pa|per
to the King, containing a bitter Invective again&s;t Bi&s;hops, and the
whole Government of the Church; as being contrary to the Word of
God, and to the Advancement of true Religion: and concluded with a
very pa&s;&s;ionate De&s;ire for the Alteration of that Government, as the only
Means to &s;ettle Peace throughout his Maje&s;ty's Dominions. In all their
other Demands, concerning the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and calling a Par|liament<MILESTONE N="50">
there, the King had only con&s;erred with two, or three of tho&s;e He
mo&s;t tru&s;ted, whereof the Chancellor of the Exchequer was always one, and
drew the An&s;wers He gave: But this la&s;t Paper which only concerned
<PB N="81" REF="88">
<HI>England,</HI> He brought to the Council Board, and required their Advice,
what An&s;wer He &s;hould give to it. The King him&s;elf was very de&s;irous to
take this Occa&s;ion, to &s;hew his Affection and Zeal for the Church; and
that other Men's Mouths might be hereafter &s;topped in that Argument,
and that no Body might ever make the &s;ame Propo&s;ition to him again, He
had a great Mind to have made an An&s;wer to every Expre&s;&s;ion in their Pa|per;
and to have &s;et out the Divine Right of Epi&s;copacy; and how im|po&s;&s;ible
it was ever for him in Con&s;cience to con&s;ent to any Thing, to the
Prejudice of that Order and Function, or to the alienating their Lands:
<MILESTONE N="10">enlarging him&s;elf more in the Debate, than He u&s;ed to do upon any other
Argument; mentioning tho&s;e Rea&s;ons which the able&s;t Prelate could do
upon that Occa&s;ion; and wi&s;hed that all tho&s;e, and &s;uch others as might
occur, &s;hould be contained in his An&s;wer.</P>
<P>MANY of the Lords were of Opinion, that a &s;hort An&s;wer would be
be&s;t, that &s;hould contain Nothing but a Rejection of the Propo&s;ition, with|out
giving any Rea&s;on: no Man &s;eeming to concur with his Maje&s;ty, with
which He was not &s;atisfied; and replied with &s;ome Sharpne&s;s upon what
had been &s;aid. Upon which the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> replied, having been be|fore
of that Mind, de&s;iring that no Rea&s;ons might be given; and upon
<MILESTONE N="20">that Occa&s;ion an&s;wered many of tho&s;e Rea&s;ons the King had urged, as
not valid to &s;upport the Subject, with a little Quickne&s;s of Wit (as his
Notions were always &s;harp, and expre&s;&s;ed with notable Vivacity) which
made the King warmer than He u&s;ed to be; reproaching all who were of
that Mind, with want of Affection for the Church; and declaring that
He would have the Sub&s;tance of what He had &s;aid, or of the like Nature,
dige&s;ted into his An&s;wer; with which Reprehen&s;ion All &s;at very &s;ilent,
having never undergone the like before.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King calls upon the Chancellor of the Exchequer to deliver his Opinion thereon.</NOTE> Whereupon the King recollect|ing
him&s;elf, and ob&s;erving, that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had not
yet &s;poke, called upon him to deliver his Opinion, adding, that He was
<MILESTONE N="30">&s;ure He was of his Maje&s;ty's Mind, with Reference to Religion, and the
Church.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor &s;tood up, and &s;aid, that He would have been glad to
have &s;aid Nothing that Day, having ob&s;erved more Warmth, than had
ever been at that Board, &s;ince He had the Honour to &s;it there (which was
not many Days before) that in Truth He was not of the Opinion of any
one who had &s;poken; He did not think that the An&s;wer ought to be very
&s;hort, or without any Rea&s;ons; and He did as little think, that the Rea|&s;ons
mentioned by his Maje&s;ty, ought to be applied to the Paper, which
the <HI>Scots</HI> had been &s;o bold as to pre&s;ent to the King. He &s;aid, all tho&s;e
<MILESTONE N="40">Rea&s;ons were fit to be offered in a Synod, or in any other Place, where
that Subject could be lawfully ventilated; and He believed them all to be
of that Weight, that Mr. <HI>Hender&s;on</HI> and all his A&s;&s;embly of Divines could
never An&s;wer; but He &s;hould be very &s;orry that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould &s;o far
conde&s;cend to their Pre&s;umption, as to give tho&s;e Rea&s;ons; as if He ad|mitted
the Matter to be di&s;puted. He a&s;ked his Maje&s;ty, what An&s;wer He
would give to the King of <HI>France,</HI> if He &s;hould &s;end to him, to alter
the Government of the City of <HI>London,</HI> or any other City, and that He
would &s;ub&s;titute other Magi&s;trates in the Place of tho&s;e, who are; which,
as a King, He might more rea&s;onably demand, than the&s;e Gentlemen of
<MILESTONE N="50"><HI>Scotland</HI> could do what They propo&s;e; whether his Maje&s;ty would think
it more agreeable to his Honour, to make a rea&s;onable Di&s;cour&s;e, of the
Antiquity of the Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> and of the Dependance the pre|&s;ent
Magi&s;trates had upon the Law, and the Frame of the Government;
<PB N="82" REF="89">
or whether, He would only &s;end him Word, that He &s;hould meddle with
what He had to do. He did think, that it was very &s;it that his Maje&s;ty's
An&s;wer to this Paper &s;hould contain a very &s;evere, and &s;harp Reprehen|&s;ion
for their Pre&s;umption; and take Notice, how &s;olicitous They were
for the Pre&s;ervation of what They called the Right and Privilege of their
Country, that his Maje&s;ty might not bring any Thing into Debate at his
Council Board here, that concerned the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> though it had
often too much Relation to the Affairs and Government of <HI>England;</HI> yet
that They would take upon them to demand from his Maje&s;ty, at lea&s;t
to advi&s;e him to make, an Alteration in the Government of <HI>England,</HI><MILESTONE N="10">
which would quite alter the Frame of it, and make &s;uch a Confu&s;ion in
the Laws; which They could no more comprehend, than They could
any of the &s;ame Kind, that related to any other foreign Kingdom; and
therefore, that for the Future They &s;hould not practi&s;e the like Pre|&s;umption.</P>
<P>THE King di&s;covered him&s;elf to be very well plea&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">With which the King is well &s;atisfied.</NOTE> all the Time He
was Speaking; and when He had done, his Maje&s;ty &s;aid again, He was
&s;ure the Chancellor was entirely of his Mind, with Reference to the
Church; and that He had &s;atisfied him, that this was not the Sea&s;on, nor
the Occa&s;ion, in which tho&s;e Arguments, which He had u&s;ed, were to<MILESTONE N="20">
be in&s;i&s;ted on; and that He was willing to depart from his own Sen&s;e;
and was in Truth &s;o well plea&s;ed, that He vouch&s;afed to make &s;ome kind
of Excu&s;e for the Pa&s;&s;ion He had &s;poken with; and all the Lords were
very well &s;atisfied with the Expedient propo&s;ed; and all commended the

who had too good Intelligence, not to know all that had
pa&s;&s;ed; and upon their long Di&s;cour&s;es with the King (who was always
forward to enlarge upon that Subject, in which He was &s;o well ver&s;ed)
expected &s;uch an An&s;wer, as might give them Opportunity to bring the

<P>THE King was much troubled at <HI>the Di&s;union between the Princes</HI> Ru|pert,
<HI>and</HI> Maurice, <HI>and the Marquis of</HI> Hertford, <HI>after the taking of</HI>
Bri&s;tol; which He knew mu&s;t exceedingly di&s;order and divide that Ar|my:
For compo&s;ing whereof, his Maje&s;ty re&s;olved the next Day after the
News, to go him&s;elf to <HI>Bri&s;tol;</HI> which was very nece&s;&s;ary in many
Re&s;pects. The Settlement of the Port, which was of infinite Importance<MILESTONE N="40">
to the King in Point of Trade, and his Cu&s;toms, and with Reference to
<HI>Ireland;</HI> and the applying the Army to &s;ome new Enterprize, without
Lo&s;s of Time, could not be done without his Maje&s;ty's Pre&s;ence. But there
was Nothing more di&s;po&s;ed his Maje&s;ty to that Re&s;olution, than to be ab|&s;ent
from his Council at <HI>Oxford,</HI> when He &s;hould &s;ettle the Differences
between the Princes, and the Marquis; for as He was always &s;wayed by
his Affection to his Nephews, which He did not think Partiality; &s;o the
Lords, towards whom the Princes did not live with any Conde&s;cen&s;ion,
were very &s;olicitous, that the Marquis might receive no Inju&s;tice, or Di&s;|obligation.
And the King, to avoid all Coun&s;el in this Particular, re|&s;olved<MILESTONE N="50">
to declare no Re&s;olution, till He &s;hould come him&s;elf to <HI>Bri&s;tol;</HI>

Chancellor of the Exchequer. The King lodging the fir&s;t Night at <HI>Malm&s;|bury;</HI>
and the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> the Ma&s;ter of the Rolls, and &s;ome other
Gentlemen lodging that Night with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, at
his Hou&s;e at <HI>Pirton,</HI> which lay in the Way to <HI>Bri&s;tol;</HI> where They were
the next Day within an Hour after the King.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor of the Exchequer had undergone &s;ome Mortification,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Chanceller of the Exche|quer's Office invaded by Mr.</HI> A&s;hburn|ham.</NOTE>
during the &s;hort Abode at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> which was the only Port of Trade
within the King's Quarters; which was like to yield a con&s;iderable Benefit
to the King, if it were well managed; and the Direction thereof belonged
<MILESTONE N="10">entirely to his Office; but when He &s;ent to the Officers of the Cu&s;toms, to
be informed of the pre&s;ent State of Trade, He found that &s;ome Treaty
was made, and Order given in it by Mr. <HI>A&s;hburnham,</HI> a Groom of the
Bedchamber; who, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and Advice of Sir <HI>John Colepep|per,</HI>
had prevailed with the King, to a&s;&s;ign that Province to him, as a
Means to rai&s;e a pre&s;ent Sum of Money for the Supply of the Army: which,
the Chancellor took very heavily, and the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> out of his Friend|&s;hip
to him, more tenderly; and expo&s;tulated it with the King with &s;ome
Warmth; and more pa&s;&s;ionately with Sir <HI>John Colepepper,</HI> and Mr. <HI>A&s;h|burnham,</HI>
as a Violation of the Friend&s;hip They profe&s;&s;ed to the Chancel|lor,
<MILESTONE N="20">and an Inva&s;ion of his Office; which no Man bears ea&s;ily.</P>
<P>THEY were both a&s;hamed of it, and made &s;ome weak Excu&s;es, of In|cogitance
and Inadvertence; and the King him&s;elf, who di&s;cerned the
Mi&s;chief that would en&s;ue, if there &s;hould be an apparent Schi&s;m among&s;t
tho&s;e He &s;o entirely tru&s;ted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King in|terpo&s;es there|in.</NOTE> was plea&s;ed to take Notice of it to the Chan|cellor,
with many gracious Expre&s;&s;ions; and &s;aid, &startq;that Mr. <HI>A&s;hburnham</HI>
being Trea&s;urer, and Payma&s;ter of the Army, He did believe &s;ome Mo|ney
might have been rai&s;ed for the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion; and only intended
it for the Pre&s;ent, without con&s;idering, it would be an Inva&s;ion of his
Right; and therefore directed, that an Account &s;hould be given to
<MILESTONE N="30">him of all that had been done, and He &s;hould do as He thought fit.&endq;
But when He under&s;tood all that had been done, He would make no Al|teration
in it, that his Maje&s;ty might be convinced, that his Service was
not looked after in the De&s;ign. And it was di&s;cernable enough, that
Mr. <HI>A&s;hburnham,</HI> who u&s;ually looked very far before him, had not &s;o
much intended to di&s;oblige the Chancellor, as by introducing him&s;elf this
Way into the Cu&s;toms, to continue one of the Farmers of the Cu&s;toms,
when the War &s;hould be at an End; of which He got a Promi&s;e from the
King at the &s;ame Time; who had great Affection for him, and an ex|traordinary
Opinion of his Managery. If there remained after this any Jea|lou&s;y
<MILESTONE N="40">or Coldne&s;s between the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the other
Two, as the Di&s;parity between their Natures, and Humours, made &s;ome

Death, which was the next after He was killed, the Chancellor received a
Letter from him, written at the Time when the Army ro&s;e from <HI>Glo|ce&s;ter;</HI>
but the Me&s;&s;enger had been employed in other Service, &s;o that He
came not to <HI>Oxford</HI> till that Day. The Letter was an An&s;wer to one the
Chancellor had then &s;ent to him; in which He had told him, how much
He &s;uffered in his Reputation with all di&s;creet Men, by engaging him&s;elf
unnece&s;&s;arily in all Places of Danger: And that it was not the Office of a
Privy Coun&s;ellor, and a Secretary of State, to vi&s;it the Trenches, as He<MILESTONE N="20">
u&s;ually did; and conjured him, out of the Con&s;cience of his Duty to the
King, and to free his Friends from tho&s;e continual unea&s;y Apprehen&s;ions,
not to engage his Per&s;on to tho&s;e Dangers, which were not incumbent to
him. His An&s;wer was, that the Trenches were now at an End, there
would be no more Danger there: That his Ca&s;e was different from other
Men's; that He was &s;o much taken Notice of for an impatient De&s;ire of
Peace, that it was nece&s;&s;ary that He &s;hould likewi&s;e make it appear, that
it was not out of Fear of the utmo&s;t Hazard of War: He &s;aid &s;ome me|lancholick
Things of the Time; and concluded, that in few Days They
&s;hould come to a Battle, the I&s;&s;ue whereof, He hoped, would put an End<MILESTONE N="30">
to the Mi&s;ery of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>MUCH hath been &s;aid of this excellent Per&s;on before; but not &s;o much,
or &s;o well, as his wonderful Parts, and Virtues de&s;erved. He died as
much of the Time as of the Bullet: For from the very beginning of the
War, He contracted &s;o deep a Sadne&s;s and Melancholy, that his Life was
not plea&s;ant to him; and &s;ure He was too weary of it. Tho&s;e who did not
know him very well, imputed, very unju&s;tly, much of it to a violent Pa&s;|&s;ion
He had for a Noble Lady: And it was the more &s;poken of, becau&s;e
She died the &s;ame Day, and as &s;ome computed it, in the &s;ame Hour that
He was killed; but They who knew either the Lord, or the Lady, knew<MILESTONE N="40">
well, that neither of them was capable of an ill Imagination. She was of
the mo&s;t un&s;potted, unblemi&s;hed Virtue, never married, of an extraordi|nary
Talent of Mind, but of no alluring Beauty, nor of a Con&s;titution of
tolerable Health, being in a deep Con&s;umption, and not like to have lived
&s;o long by many Months. It is very true, the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> had an ex|traordinary
E&s;teem of her, and exceedingly loved her Conver&s;ation, as
mo&s;t of the Per&s;ons of eminent Parts of that Time did; for She was in her
Under&s;tanding, and Di&s;cretion, and Wit, and Mode&s;ty, above mo&s;t Wo|men;
the be&s;t of which had always a Friend&s;hip with her. But He was
withal &s;o kind to his Wife, whom He knew to be an excellent Per&s;on,<MILESTONE N="50">
that, though He loved his Children with more Affection and Fondne&s;s,
than mo&s;t Fathers u&s;e to do, He left by his Will all He had to his Wife;
<PB N="85" REF="92">
and committed his three Sons, who were all the Children he had, to her
&s;ole Care and Bounty.</P>
<P>HE was little more than thirty Years of Age when He was killed; in
which Time He was very accompli&s;hed in all tho&s;e Parts of Learning, and
Knowledge, which mo&s;t Men labour to attain, till They are very Old;
and in Wi&s;dom, and the Practice of Virtue, to a wonderful Perfection.
From his Age of twenty Years, He had lived in an entire Friend&s;hip with
the Chancellor, who was about &s;ix Months elder; and who never &s;pake
of him afterwards, but with a Love, and a Grief, which &s;till rai&s;ed &s;ome
<MILESTONE N="10">Commotion in him. And He very often u&s;ed to lament him, in the Words
of <HI>Cicero</HI> concerning <HI>Horten&s;ius, Quod magn&acirc; Sapientium &amp; Civium bono|rum
Penuri&acirc;, Vir egregius, conjuncti&s;&s;imu&s;que mecum Con&s;iliorum omnium So|cietate,
alieni&s;&s;imo Reipublicoe Tempore extinctus, &amp; Auctoritatis, &amp; Pru|dentioe
&s;uoe, tri&s;te nobis De&s;iderium reliquerat.</HI> And without Doubt, it was
in a Conjuncture of Time, when the Death of every hone&s;t and di&s;creet
Per&s;on was a very &s;en&s;ible, and terrible Lo&s;s, in the Judgment of all good
Men.</P>
<P>AFTER the unhappy Death of the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> the King much de|&s;ired
that the Chancellor of the Exchequer &s;hould be Secretary of State in
<MILESTONE N="20">his Place; which the Queen did not oppo&s;e, though She rather wi&s;hed
that the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> might have it; who had &s;o much Kindne&s;s and
Friend&s;hip for the Chancellor (which was at that Time, and long after, as
Sincere as could receive Harbour in his Brea&s;t) that He profe&s;&s;ed, He would
not have it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chencel|lor of the Ex|chequer re+fu&s;es the Of|fice of Secre|tary of State a &s;econd Time.</NOTE> if the other would receive it: but the Chancellor gratified his
Civility, and refu&s;ed the Office, the &s;econd Time, as He had once be|fore.
And He had &s;o much more Rea&s;on now, by the coming of a very
&s;pecious Emba&s;&s;y from <HI>France,</HI> in the Per&s;on of the Count of <HI>Harcourt,</HI>
who was already arrived in <HI>London;</HI> in which the Chancellor knew his
own Want of Ability, to act that Part, the Office of Secretary would have
<MILESTONE N="30">obliged him to; and for which, as far as the Perfection of the <HI>French</HI>
Tongue could qualify him, the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> was very proper; and &s;o He
was made Secretary of State; profe&s;&s;ing to every Body, that as He had the
Office by the Chancellor's Refu&s;al of it, &s;o He would wholly advi&s;e with
him in all Things pertaining to it, which He always did; and the Confi|dence
and Friend&s;hip between them was mutual, and very notorious, un|til
that Lord changed his Religion. And He was no &s;ooner admitted and
&s;worn Secretary of State, and Privy-Coun&s;ellor, and con&s;equently made of
the <HI>Junto,</HI> which the King at that Time created, con&s;i&s;ting of the Duke
of <HI>Richmond,</HI> the Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> the two Secretaries of State, and Sir
<MILESTONE N="40"><HI>John Colepepper,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">He is added to the Junto.</NOTE> but the Chancellor of the Exchequer was likewi&s;e added;
to the Trouble, at lea&s;t the Surprize, of the Ma&s;ter of the Rolls; who
could have been contented, that He &s;hould have been excluded from that
near Tru&s;t, where all Matters were to be con&s;ulted, before they &s;hould be
brought to the Council Board. And this Committee was appointed to
treat with the Count of <HI>Harcourt;</HI> whom the King believed to be &s;ent
from <HI>France,</HI> to demand any Thing from the Parliament in that King's
Name, as his Maje&s;ty &s;hould direct; and therefore They were appointed
to con&s;ider well, what He &s;hould be directed to propo&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT the Amba&s;&s;ador no &s;ooner came to the Town in great State and
<MILESTONE N="50">Lu&s;tre, but He quickly &s;aved them any farther Labour, by declaring, that
He would treat with no Body but the King him&s;elf; his Bu&s;ine&s;s being
only to &s;erve the King, with Reference to the Differences between his Ma|je&s;ty,
and the Parliament; and pretended that in his &s;hort Stay at <HI>London,</HI>
<PB N="86" REF="93">
He had already di&s;covered that his Maje&s;ty was betrayed; and that his mo&s;t
&s;ecret Coun&s;els were di&s;covered: and &s;o there was never any Commmunica|tion
between him, and the King's Council; but all Matters were tran&s;acted
with the King him&s;elf, and Queen, and Lord <HI>Jermyn,</HI> who was not of
the Council, and the Lord <HI>Digby;</HI> the Queen promi&s;ing her&s;elf very much
from his Negotiation; the Amba&s;&s;ador being then of great Reputation,
having been General of the <HI>French</HI> Army in two or three great Actions, in
which his Succe&s;s had been very notable; and the Queen looked upon him
as a Per&s;on particularly devoted to her Service; and being of the Hou&s;e of
<HI>Lorrain</HI> (the younger Son of the Duke <HI>d'Elboeuf)</HI> He was not without<MILESTONE N="10">
&s;ome Alliance to the King; and &s;o He returned to <HI>London</HI> with &s;uch In|&s;tructions,
and Advice as They thought fit to entru&s;t him with; which
were too Particular; and with the Privity only of the two other Per&s;ons
mentioned before.</P>
<P>BUT it quickly appeared after, that He was not &s;ent with any Purpo&s;e
to do the King Service; but that Gardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI> (who was newly en|tered
upon the Mini&s;try, after the Death of Cardinal <HI>Richelieu</HI>) might take
&s;uch a View of the Affairs of <HI>England,</HI> as the better to judge what He was
to do; and that an Accommodation there might not break his Mea&s;ures,
with Reference to his other De&s;igns; which the Amba&s;&s;ador was ea&s;ily<MILESTONE N="20">
&s;atisfied it was not like to do. And &s;o, after three, or four Months &s;pent
between <HI>Oxford,</HI> and <HI>London,</HI> He returned to <HI>France;</HI> leaving the King's
Affairs &s;o much wor&s;e than He found them, by having communicated
&s;ome In&s;tructions, which had been given him at <HI>Oxford,</HI> with over much
Confidence, and which le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed &s;ome Per&s;ons to Peace than They had
been, at <HI>London,</HI></P>
<P>THE King called the Chancellor one Day to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King di|rects the Chancellor of the Exchequer to prepare a Proclamation for di&s;&s;olving the Parlia|ment at <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter.</HI></NOTE> and told him, &startq;that
He thought there was too much Honour done to tho&s;e Rebels at <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter</HI>
in all his Declarations, by his mentioning them as Part of the
Parliament; which as long as They &s;hould be thought to be, They would<MILESTONE N="30">
have more Authority by their continuing their Sitting in the Place, whi|ther
They were fir&s;t called, than all the other Members, though &s;o
much more numerous, would have, when They &s;hould be convened any
where el&s;e (there being a Thought of convening them to <HI>Oxford</HI>) there|fore
He knew no Rea&s;on why He &s;hould not po&s;itively declare them to
be di&s;&s;olved; and &s;o forbid them to &s;it or meet any more there. He &s;aid,
that He knew learned Men of an Opinion, that that Act for the conti|nuance
of the Parliament was void from the Beginning; and that it is not
in the Power of the King, to bar him&s;elf from the Power of di&s;&s;olving
it; which is to be deprived of an e&s;&s;ential Part of his Sovereignty: But<MILESTONE N="40">
if the Act were good and valid in Law, They had di&s;&s;olved them&s;elves,
by their Force, in driving &s;o many Members, and even his Maje&s;ty him|&s;elf,
who was their Head, from the Parliament; and had forfeited
their Right of Sitting there, and all that the Act had given them, by
their Trea&s;on, and Rebellion; which the very being a Parliament could
not &s;upport: And therefore He wi&s;hed, that a Proclamation might be
prepared, to declare them actually di&s;&s;olved; and expre&s;ly forbidding
them to meet, or any Body to own them, or &s;ubmit to them, as a Par|liament.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Chancellor told him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Advice to the King on that Subject.</NOTE> that &startq;He perceived by his Maje&s;ty's Di&s;|cour&s;e,<MILESTONE N="50">
that He had very much con&s;idered the Argument, and was well
prepared in it; which for his Part He was not. But He be&s;ought him
to think it worth a very &s;trict Reflection; and to hear the Opinion of
<PB N="87" REF="94">
learned Men, before He re&s;olved upon it. That it was of a very nice
and delicate Nature, at which not only the People in general, but tho&s;e
of his own Party, and even of his Council, would take more Umbrage,
than upon any one Particular, that had happened &s;ince the Beginning of
the War. That He could not imagine that his forbidding them to meet
any more at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> would make one Man the le&s;s to meet there;
but He might forbid them upon &s;uch Grounds and Rea&s;ons, as might
bring more to them: And that They who had &s;evered them&s;elves from
them, upon the Guilt of their Actions; might return, and be reconciled
<MILESTONE N="10">to them, upon their Unity of Opinion. That it had been the
fir&s;t powerful Reproach They had corrupted the People with, towards
his Maje&s;ty, that He intended to di&s;&s;olve this Parliament, notwith&s;tand|ing
the Act for Continuance thereof; and if He had Power to do that,
He might likewi&s;e by the &s;ame Power, repeal all the other Acts made
this Parliament; whereof &s;ome were very precious to the People: And
as his Maje&s;ty had always di&s;claimed any &s;uch Thought, &s;o &s;uch a Procla|mation
as He now mentioned, would confirm all the Fears and Jea|lou&s;ies,
which had been infu&s;ed into them; and would trouble many of
his own true Subjects.&endq;</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20">&startq;THAT for the Invalidity of the Act from the Beginning, He was in his
own Opinion inclined to hope, that it might be originally void; for the
Rea&s;ons and Grounds his Maje&s;ty had mentioned; and that the Parliament
it &s;elf, if this Rebellion was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, might be of the &s;ame
Judgment, and declare it accordingly, which would enable him quickly
to di&s;&s;olve it: But till then, He thought all the Judges together, even
tho&s;e who were in his own Quarters, and of unque&s;tionable Affection to
his Maje&s;ty, would not declare any &s;uch Invalidity; and much le&s;s, that
any private Man, how learned &s;oever, would avow that Judgment: in
which his Maje&s;ty might ea&s;ily &s;atisfy him&s;elf, having &s;o many of the
<MILESTONE N="30">Judges, and many other excellent Men of the Robe then at <HI>Oxford.</HI>
For their having di&s;&s;olved them&s;elves, or forfeited their Right of Sitting
there, by their Trea&s;on and Rebellion, <HI>He &s;aid,</HI> He could le&s;s under|&s;tand
it, than the other Argument of Invalidity; for that the Trea&s;on,
and Rebellion could only concern, and be penal to the Per&s;ons who
committed them; it was po&s;&s;ible many might fit there, He was &s;ure
many had a Right to fit there, who had always oppo&s;ed every Illegal,
and every Rebellious Act; and therefore the Faults of the others, could
never forfeit any Right of theirs, who had committed no Fault. And
upon the whole Matter, concluded as He had begun, that his Maje&s;ty
<MILESTONE N="40">would very throughly con&s;ult it, before He did &s;o much as incline in his
own Wi&s;hes.&endq;</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty &s;aid, He had &s;poken more Rea&s;on again&s;t it, than He
had thought could have been alledged: However, He bade him confer
with his Attorney General, who, He believed, was of another Opinion.
The Chancellor moved his Maje&s;ty, that &s;ince the Ground of what &s;hould
be re&s;olved on in this Point, mu&s;t be expre&s;&s;ed in the Proclamation, the
Attorney might put his own Conceptions in Writing, and then his Ma|je&s;ty
would the better judge of them. The King &s;aid, it &s;eemed rea|&s;onable
to him, and He had propo&s;ed it to him, but He had declined it,
<MILESTONE N="50">and commended the Pen his Maje&s;ty had u&s;ed to employ, as very clear and
&s;ignificant; and &s;aid, if He had an Hour's Conference with that Per&s;on,
the Bu&s;ine&s;s would be done. Whereupon the Chancellor went immediately
to his Lodging, chu&s;ing rather to u&s;e that Civility towards him, than to
<PB N="88" REF="95">
&s;end for him; who did not love him &s;o well as He had done, before He
was his &s;uperior Officer.</P>
<P>AFTER a long Conference together,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Confe|rences with the Attorney General there|on.</NOTE> and many Circumlocutions (which
was his natural Way of Di&s;cour&s;e) and a&s;king Que&s;tions, <HI>why not this?</HI> and
<HI>why not that?</HI> without expre&s;&s;ing his own Opinion; at la&s;t He confe&s;&s;ed,
that there mu&s;t be no Attempt to di&s;&s;olve them, &startq;though it might be
even that might be lawful in many Re&s;pects,&endq; but that it would be &s;uf|ficient
to declare the Force which had been, and &s;till was upon them, that
rendered them not Free; and &s;o They ought not to be looked upon as a
Parliament: And that They might be required, to adjourn from Time,<MILESTONE N="10">
to Time, till all the Members might with Safety repair to, and &s;it with
them; in all which the other agreed with him, and &s;o They parted; the
Chancellor promi&s;ing that, again&s;t the next Morning, He would prepare
a Proclamation agreeable to that, which He thought to be their joint
Meaning; for He did not ob&s;erve any Difference to be between them.
The next Morning the Attorney came to his Lodging, where He found
the Draught prepared, which as &s;oon as He had read, He &s;aid did in no
Degree expre&s;s, or comprehend the Sen&s;e that had been agreed between
them: And thereupon, He entered again into the &s;ame Di&s;cour&s;e He had
made before, and more perplexed than before; being mo&s;t offended with<MILESTONE N="20">
the Preamble, wherein it was declared, that the King neither could, or
intended, to break the Parliament: which was &s;o contrary to what He had
infu&s;ed into the King; and which the Chancellor thought mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary,
to contradict that Reproach, which naturally would be ca&s;t upon his Ma|je&s;ty.
In the End, when He had wearied him&s;elf with the Debate, They
came both again to mean the &s;ame Thing; which was no other, than was
agreed before, though as the Attorney &s;aid, it was not expre&s;&s;ed in the
Draught before them: whereupon it was agreed between them, that
again&s;t the next Morning, either of them &s;hould make a Draught apart;
and then, when They came together, it would ea&s;ily be adju&s;ted.<MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>BUT the next Morning They were as far a&s;under as before, and the
Attorney had prepared no Paper, and &s;aid, it needed not, the Difference
being very &s;mall, and would be rectified with changing, or leaving out a
Word or two; which the Chancellor de&s;ired him to do, and to leave out,
or put in, what He plea&s;ed: which when He went about to do, twenty
other Things occurred to him; and &s;o He entered upon new Di&s;cour&s;es,
without concluding any Thing; and every Day entertained the King with
an Account, as if all were agreed; but upon Conference with the Chan|cellor,
his Maje&s;ty wondered at the Delay, and told him, He wondered
at it, for the Attorney &s;pake &s;till as clearly to him, as it was po&s;&s;ible for<MILESTONE N="40">
any Man to do, and therefore the putting it in Writing could not be hard.
The other an&s;wered him, that it would never be done any other Way,
than that, which He had fir&s;t propo&s;ed to him; and therefore be&s;ought his
Maje&s;ty, that He would oblige the Attorney to put his own Conceptions,
which He made &s;o clear to him, into Writing; and then, his Maje&s;ty
having likewi&s;e what the Chancellor prepared in his Hands, He would
ea&s;ily conclude which &s;hould &s;tand; and otherwi&s;e there would never be any
Conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>ABOUT two Days after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who&s;e Draught of a Proclamation the King &s;hews to the Chan|cellor of the Exchequer.</NOTE> the Chancellor came into the Garden where the
King was walking; and calling him &s;hortly to him, in &s;ome Di&s;order,<MILESTONE N="50">
his Maje&s;ty told him, &startq;He was never in that Amazement in his Life;
that He had at la&s;t, not without a very po&s;itive Command, obliged the
Attorney to bring him &s;uch a Draught in Writing, as was agreeable to
<PB N="89" REF="96">
his own Sen&s;e; and that He had now done it; but in &s;uch a Manner,
that He no more under&s;tood what the Meaning of it was, than if it were
in <HI>Welch,</HI> which was the Language of the Attorney's Country: only,
He &s;aid, &startq;He was very &s;ure it contained nothing of the Sen&s;e He had ever
&startq;expre&s;&s;ed to him;&endq; and &s;o bade him follow him into a little Room at the
End of the Garden; where as &s;oon as He was entered He &s;hut the Door,
becau&s;e there were many People in the Garden; and then pulled a Paper
out of his Pocket, and bade him read it; which when he had done, it
being all in the Attorney's own Hand, He &s;aid, &startq;it de&s;erved Wonder in|deed;&endq;
<MILESTONE N="10">and it was &s;o rough, perplexed, and in&s;ignificant, that no Man
could judge by it, or out of it, what the Writer propo&s;ed to him&s;elf. And
it made &s;o great an Impre&s;&s;ion upon the King (who had before thought him
a Man of a Ma&s;ter Rea&s;on, and that no Man had &s;o clear Notions) that He
never after had any E&s;teem of him.</P>
<P>THE Truth is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of the Attorney General.</NOTE> He was a Man very unlike any other Man; of a very
good natural Wit, improved by Conver&s;ation with learned Men, but not
at all by Study and Indu&s;try: And then his Conver&s;ation was mo&s;t with
Men, though much &s;uperior to him in Parts, who rather admired, than
informed him, of which his Nature (being the proude&s;t Man living) made
<MILESTONE N="20">him not capable, becau&s;e not de&s;irous. His greate&s;t Faculty was, and in
which He was a Ma&s;ter, to make difficult Matters more intricate and per|plexed;
and very ea&s;y Things to &s;eem more hard than they were. The
King con&s;idered the Matter and Subject of that Proclamation, at the
Council; where that Draught the Chancellor had provided, was agreed
to; and the Attorney &s;eemed to be &s;atisfied in it; and was content to have
it believed, that it had been con&s;ulted with him; though He never for|gave
the Chancellor for expo&s;ing him in that Manner; by which He found
He had lo&s;t much Ground.</P>
<P>AFTER the Treaty of <HI>Uxbridge,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King's Approbation of the Chan|cellor of the Exchequer's Behaviour in the Treaty of</HI> Uxbridge.</NOTE> mo&s;t of the Commi&s;&s;ioners had given &s;o
<MILESTONE N="30">good a Te&s;timony of the Chancellor's Diligence and Indu&s;try, that the
King, &s;hortly after his Return, very graciou&s;ly took Notice of it to him;
and above all, of his Affection to the Church, of which, He &s;aid, Dr. <HI>Steward</HI>
had &s;o fully informed him, that He looked upon him as one of the few,
who was to be relied upon in that Particular: at which He &s;aid, him&s;elf
was not at all &s;urprized, having long known his Affection, and Judgment
in that Point; but confe&s;&s;ed He was &s;urprized with the Carriage of &s;ome
others, from whom He had expected another kind of Behaviour, in Mat|ters
of the Church; and named Sir <HI>Orlando Bridgman,</HI> upon whom He
&s;aid, He had always looked, being the Son of a Bi&s;hop, as &s;o firm, that
<MILESTONE N="40">He could not be &s;haken; and therefore He was the more amazed, to hear
what Conde&s;cen&s;ions He had been willing to have made, in what con|cerned
Religion; and pre&s;&s;ed the Chancellor to an&s;wer &s;ome Que&s;tions He
a&s;ked him about that Tran&s;action: to the Particulars whereof He excu&s;ed
him&s;elf from an&s;wering, by the Prote&s;tation, They had all taken before
the Treaty, with his Maje&s;ty's Approbation: though indeed him&s;elf had
been very much &s;urprized with the fir&s;t Di&s;covery of that Temper in that
Gentleman, which He had never before &s;u&s;pected: and ever after &s;aid,
that &startq;He was a Man of excellent Parts, and hone&s;tly inclined; and would
chu&s;e much rather to do well than ill; but if it were not &s;afe for him to
<MILESTONE N="50">be &s;teady in tho&s;e Re&s;olutions, He was &s;o much given to find out Expe|dients

THE <HI>King at that Time having re&s;olved to &s;eparate the Prince his Son
from him&s;elf, by &s;ending him into the We&s;t,</HI> the Chancellor had a great De|&s;ire
to excu&s;e him&s;elf from attending upon the Prince in that Journey;

He &s;ubmitted to do any Thing which His Maje&s;ty &s;hould judge fit

<P>THE Chancellor &s;peaking one Day with the Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> who
was exceedingly kind to him, of the ill State of the King's Affairs, and of
the Prince's Journey into the We&s;t, the Duke a&s;ked him, whether He was
well re&s;olved to carry the Prince into <HI>France,</HI> when He &s;hould be requi|red.
He an&s;wered, that there had been no &s;uch Thing mentioned to him,
nor could He ever be made in&s;trumental in it, but in one Ca&s;e, which was,
to prevent his falling into the Hands of the Parliament; and in that Ca&s;e, He
did believe every hone&s;t Man would rather advi&s;e his going any whither, than<MILESTONE N="20">
be taken by them: Yet even in that Ca&s;e, He &s;hould prefer many Places
before <HI>France.</HI> The Duke wi&s;hed He might &s;tay till then, implying that
He doubted it was the pre&s;ent De&s;ign; but there was never any Thing
di&s;covered to make it believed, that there was a De&s;ign at that Time for|med
to &s;uch a Purpo&s;e: yet the Lord <HI>Dighy,</HI> who had all Familiarity,
and Confidence with the Chancellor, &s;hortly after gave him Occa&s;ion to
apprehend, that there might even then be &s;ome &s;uch Intention.</P>
<P>AFTER a long Di&s;cour&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lord</HI> Digby'<HI>s Di&s;cour&s;e with the Chancellor concerning the Prince's going to</HI> France.</NOTE> of the great Satisfaction the King had in his
(the Chancellor's) Service; and how much He was plea&s;ed with his Beha|viour
in the Treaty at <HI>Uxbridge;</HI> and that He had not a greater Confi|dence<MILESTONE N="30">
in any Man's Affection, and Fidelity; He &s;aid, his Maje&s;ty had a
great Mind to confer with him upon a Point of the la&s;t Importance; but
that He was kept from it, by an Apprehen&s;ion, that He was of a diffe|rent
Judgment from his Maje&s;ty in that Particular. The other an&s;wered,
that He was very &s;orry that the King was re&s;erved for &s;uch a Rea&s;on; for
though he knew, the Chancellor did never pretend to think one Thing,
when He did think another, and &s;o might take the Boldne&s;s to differ from
his Maje&s;ty in his Judgment; yet the King could not believe, that He
would di&s;cover the Secret, or refu&s;e to do any Thing that became an ho|ne&s;t
Man, upon his Command, though He did not believe it coun&s;ellable.<MILESTONE N="40">
Whereupon, He entered upon a very rea&s;onable Con&s;ideration, of the low
Condition of the King; of the Di&s;content and Murmur of the Court, and
of the Camp; how very difficult a Thing it was like to be, to rai&s;e &s;uch
an Army as would be fit to take the Field; and how much more unfit it
would be, for the King to &s;uffer him&s;elf to be enclo&s;ed in any Garri&s;on;
which He mu&s;t be, if there were no Army for him to be in. If the fir&s;t
Difficulty &s;hould be ma&s;tered, and an Army made ready to march, there
could be little Doubt, how great &s;oever their Di&s;tractions were at <HI>London,</HI>
but that the Parliament would be able to &s;end another more numerous,
and much better &s;upplied than the King's could be; and then, if the<MILESTONE N="50">
King's Army was beaten, He could have no Hope ever to rai&s;e another;
his Quarters already being very &s;treight; and after a Defeat, the victorious
Army would find no Oppo&s;ition; nor was there any Garri&s;on that could
<PB N="91" REF="98">
oppo&s;e them any con&s;iderable Time; <HI>London</HI> would pour out more
Forces; that all the We&s;t would be &s;wallowed up in an In&s;tant; and in
&s;uch a Ca&s;e He a&s;ked him, whether He would not think it fit, and a&s;&s;i&s;t
to the carrying the Prince out of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor told him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel|lor's Reply.</NOTE> He would deliver his Opinion freely to him,
and was willing He &s;hould let the King know it. That &s;uch a Pro&s;pect
as He had &s;uppo&s;ed, might, and ought to be prudently con&s;idered; but
that it mu&s;t be with great Secre&s;y, for that there were already to his Know|ledge,
&s;ome Whi&s;pers of &s;uch a Purpo&s;e; and that it was the true End of
<MILESTONE N="10">&s;ending the Prince into the We&s;t; which, if it &s;hould be believed, it would
never be in their Power to execute, though the Occa&s;ion &s;hould be mo&s;t
pre&s;&s;ing; therefore de&s;ired there might not be the lea&s;t Whi&s;per of any
Contingency, that might make it fit. For the Matter it &s;elf, it mu&s;t never
be done, upon any Suppo&s;ition of a Nece&s;&s;ity; but when the Nece&s;&s;ity
&s;hould be real, and in View, it ought to be re&s;olved, and executed at
once: And He would make no Scruple of carrying him rather into <HI>Turkey,</HI>
than &s;uffering him to be made a Pri&s;oner to the Parliament.</P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Digby</HI> replied, that though the King would be very well
plea&s;ed with this Opinion of his, yet He would not be &s;urprized with it;
<MILESTONE N="20">&s;ince He knew his Affection, and Wi&s;dom to be &s;uch, that in &s;uch an Ex|tremity,
He could not but have that Re&s;olution: therefore that was not
the Point that the King doubted He would differ with him in. Then He
continued the Di&s;cour&s;e, that He hoped there would not &s;uch an Occa&s;ion
fall out; and that the Divi&s;ions at <HI>London</HI> would yet open &s;ome Door for
a good Peace to enter at; but if They &s;hould unite, and &s;hould &s;end out
a &s;trong Army, and likewi&s;e appoint the <HI>Scots</HI> to march towards them;
how the King would do between two &s;uch Armies, was a terrible Pro&s;|pect:
and then the lea&s;t Blow would rai&s;e &s;o general a Con&s;ternation, that
the King would be more di&s;quieted by his Friends, and Servants, than by
<MILESTONE N="30">the Enemy: That his Council was &s;o con&s;tituted, that They would look
upon the Prince's leaving the Kingdom, as le&s;s advi&s;able, than giving
him&s;elf up to the Parliament; and that many Men were yet &s;o weak, as to
believe, that the be&s;t Way the King could take for his Security, and
Pre&s;ervation of his Po&s;terity, was, to deliver up both Him&s;elf, and all his
Children, into the Hands of the Parliament; and that They would then
give him better Conditions, than They had offered in their Treaties;
having it then in their Power to keep all &s;uch Per&s;ons from him, as They
were di&s;&s;atisfied with.</P>
<P>IF this Opinion &s;hould once &s;pread it &s;elf, as upon any &s;ignal Defeat it
<MILESTONE N="40">would undoubtedly do, it mu&s;t be expected, that the Council, and mo&s;t
of the Lords, who looked upon them&s;elves as ruined for their Loyalty,
out of their natural Apprehen&s;ion, would imagine, that the Prince being
then in the We&s;t, and at Liberty to do what &s;hould be thought fit, would
be directed by the King, to tran&s;port him&s;elf into Parts beyond the Sea;
and the Queen his Mother being then in <HI>France,</HI> mo&s;t probably thither;
which was a Circum&s;tance that would likewi&s;e make his Tran&s;portation
more univer&s;ally odious. So that upon this Reflection, and erroneous Ani|madver&s;ion,
the King would be, in the fir&s;t unfortunate Conjuncture, im|portuned
by all about him, to &s;end for the Prince; or at lea&s;t to &s;end &s;uch
<MILESTONE N="50">Orders to tho&s;e to who&s;e Care He was entru&s;ted, that They &s;hould not
pre&s;ume to tran&s;port him beyond the Seas, in what Exigent &s;oever. Mo&s;t
Men would believe, that They &s;hould merit of the Parliament by this Ad|vice,
and would pro&s;ecute it with the more Earne&s;tne&s;s and Importunity;
<PB N="92" REF="99">
whil&s;t tho&s;e Few who di&s;cerned the Mi&s;chief and Ruin that mu&s;t flow
from it, would not have the Courage to deliver their Opinions in Publick,
for Fear of being accu&s;ed of the Coun&s;el; and by this Means the King
might be &s;o wearied and tired with Importunity, that again&s;t his Judg|ment,
He might be prevailed with, to &s;ign &s;uch a Direction and Order,
as is before mentioned; though his Maje&s;ty was clearly &s;atisfied in his Un|der&s;tanding,
that if both him&s;elf and the Prince were in their Hands toge|ther,
the be&s;t that could happen, would be Murdering him, and Crown|ing
his Son; whereas if his Son were at Liberty, and out of their Reach,
They would get Nothing by his Death, and con&s;equently would not at|tempt<MILESTONE N="10">
it.</P>
<P>THIS he &s;aid, was the fatal Conjuncture the King apprehended; and He
then a&s;ked the Chancellor, what He would do. To which He an&s;wered,
without pau&s;ing, that He hoped the King had made up a firm Re&s;olution
never to depart from his own Virtue, upon which his Fate depended: and
that if He for&s;ook him&s;elf, He had no Rea&s;on to depend upon the Con|&s;tancy
of any other Man, who had Nothing to &s;upport that Confidence, but
the Con&s;cience of doing what was ju&s;t: that no Man could doubt the Law|fulne&s;s
of obeying him, in carrying the Prince out of the Kingdom, to
avoid his being taken by the Rebels; and He was not only ready to obey<MILESTONE N="20">
in that Ca&s;e, but would confidently advi&s;e it, as a Thing in Policy and Pru|dence
nece&s;&s;ary to be done. But if the King, being at Liberty, and with
his own Coun&s;ellors and Servants, &s;hould under his Hand forbid the Prince
to tran&s;port him&s;elf, and forbid all about him, to &s;uffer it to be done, He
would never be guilty of di&s;obeying that expre&s;s Command; though He
&s;hould be very &s;orry to receive it. He wi&s;hed the King would &s;peak with
him of it, that He might take the Boldne&s;s to conjure him, never to put
an hone&s;t, and a faithful Servant to that unju&s;t Streight, to do any Thing
expre&s;ly contrary to his plain, and po&s;itive Command, upon Pretence, of
knowing his &s;ecret Plea&s;ure; which is expo&s;ing him to publick Ju&s;tice,<MILESTONE N="30">
and Reproach, which can never be wiped out by the Con&s;c&iuml;ence of the
other; and that the Artifice was not worthy the Royal Brea&s;t of a great
Monarch. This, he &s;aid, was &s;till upon the Suppo&s;ition of the King's
Liberty; but if He were a Pri&s;oner in the Hands of his Enemies (though
that &s;hould not &s;hake his Re&s;olution, or make him &s;ay Things He doth
not intend, upon Imagination that others will know his Meaning) the Ca&s;e
would be different; and hone&s;t Men would pur&s;ue former Re&s;olutions,
though They &s;hould be countermanded, according to Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>THE Conference ended; and was never after re&s;umed: nor did the
King ever in the lea&s;t Degree, enter upon the Argument with the Chan|cellor,<MILESTONE N="40">
though He had many private Conferences with him upon all that
occurred to him with Reference to what the Prince &s;hould do in the We&s;t;
and of all the melancholick Contingencies, which might fall out in his
own Fortune. And it was generally believed, that his Maje&s;ty had a much
greater Confidence in the Chancellor, than in the other, who&s;e Judgment
He had no Reverence for; and this made the Chancellor afterwards be|lieve,
that all the other Di&s;cour&s;e from the Lord <HI>Dighy,</HI> proceeded rather
from &s;ome Communication of Coun&s;els He had with the Queen, than any
Directions from the King. And He did upon concurrent Circum&s;tances ever
think, that the Queen did from the fir&s;t Minute of the Separation of the<MILESTONE N="50">
Prince, from the King, intend to draw his Highne&s;s into <HI>France,</HI> that He
might be near her, and under her Tuition, before any Thing in the de|clen&s;ion
of the King's Fortune required it, or made it coun&s;ellable; and
<PB N="93" REF="100">
therefore had appointed the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> her Creature, who She knew had
great Friend&s;hip with the Chancellor, to feel his Pul&s;e, and di&s;cover, whe|ther
He (in whom She had never Confidence) might be applicable to her
Purpo&s;es. But He often declared, that the King him&s;elf never intimated
the lea&s;t Thought of the Prince's leaving the Kingdom, till after the Bat|tle
of <HI>Na&s;eby;</HI> and when <HI>Fairfax</HI> was marched with his Army into the
We&s;t; and him&s;elf was in De&s;pair of being able to rai&s;e another Army;
and even then, when He &s;ignified his Plea&s;ure to that Purpo&s;e, He left
the Time, and the Manner, and the Place to them, who were e&s;pecially
<MILESTONE N="10">tru&s;ted by him, about the Prince; as will appear by the particular Pa|pers
which are pre&s;erved of that Affair; and wherein it will likewi&s;e ap|pear,
that his Maje&s;ty received infinite Satisfaction, and Content in the
whole Management of that Affair, and the happy and &s;ecure Tran&s;porta|tion
of the Prince, in the ju&s;t and proper Sea&s;on, and when all the King|dom
was right glad that it was done.</P>
<P>As his Maje&s;ty was more particularly gracious to the Chancellor from
the Time of the Treaty at <HI>Uxbridge;</HI> &s;o there was no Day pa&s;&s;ed, without
his conferring with him in private upon his mo&s;t &s;ecret Con&s;iderations,
and Apprehen&s;ions, before his Departure with the Prince for the <HI>We&s;t.</HI>
<MILESTONE N="20">One Day He told him, He was very glad of what the Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI>
had done the Day before; and indeed He had done &s;omewhat the Day
before, which very much &s;urprized the Chancellor. When his Maje&s;ty
aro&s;e from Council, the Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI> whi&s;pered &s;omewhat privately
to him, upon which the King went into his Bedchamber; and the Duke
called the Chancellor, and told him, the King would &s;peak with him,
and &s;o took him by the Hand, and led him into the Bedchamber; the Pri|vilege,
and Dignity of which Room was then &s;o punctually pre&s;erved, that
the King very rarely called any Privy Coun&s;ellor to confer with him there,
who was not of the Bedchamber; which maintained a ju&s;t Reverence to
<MILESTONE N="30">the Place, and an E&s;teem of tho&s;e who were admitted to attend there.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as He came into the Room,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Chancellor with the King's Appro|bation, form, a Friend&s;hip with the Duke of</HI> Richmond.</NOTE> before He &s;aid any Thing to the
King, who was there alone, the Duke &s;pake to the Chancellor, and told
him, that He had been brought up from his Childhood by the Crown, and
had always paid it the Obedience of a Child; that as He had taken a
Wife with the Approbation, and Advice of the Crown; &s;o He had never
made a Friend&s;hip, which He took to be a Kind of Marriage, without the
King's Privity, and particular Approbation; that He had long had a Kind|ne&s;s
for him, but had taken Time to know him well, which He thought
He now did; and therefore had a&s;ked his Maje&s;ty's Con&s;ent, that He
<MILESTONE N="40">might make a Friend&s;hip with him: and then &s;aid to the King, &startq;Sir,
have I not your Approbation to this Conjunction?&endq; to which his Ma|je&s;ty
&s;aid, &startq;yes, my Lord, I am very glad of it; and I will pa&s;s my Word
to you for the Chancellor, that you will not repent it;&endq; with many
gracious Expre&s;&s;ions to them both: And &s;o the Duke led him out of the
Room again, &s;aying, now Mr. Chancellor it is in your Power to deceive
me. And to this it was, that his Maje&s;ty's Di&s;cour&s;e related the next Day,
when He told him, He was glad of what had pa&s;&s;ed, &amp;c. and &s;aid, He
hoped He would give him good Coun&s;el; for He had not of late lived to|wards
him in the Manner he was u&s;ed to do; that He knew well the Duke
<MILESTONE N="50">was a very hone&s;t, and worthy Man, and had all the Kindne&s;s, as well as
Duty for his Maje&s;ty; but that He was grown &s;ullen, or di&s;contented, and
had not the &s;ame Countenance He u&s;ed to have; for which He could ima|gine
no other Rea&s;on, but that his Man <HI>Webb</HI> gave him ill Coun&s;el: He
<PB N="94" REF="101">
&s;aid, He was well contented that He &s;hould take Notice, that his Maje&s;ty
was not well &s;atisfied; and a&s;ked him &s;uddenly, when the Duke was at
<HI>Oriel</HI> College with them; <HI>Oriel</HI> College was the Lodging of the Lord
Trea&s;urer, where that Committee for &s;ecret Affairs, of which the Duke
was one, u&s;ed to meet. The Chancellor an&s;wered, that indeed the Duke
had not been there lately, which he thought had proceeded from his At|tendance
upon his Maje&s;ty, or &s;ome other nece&s;&s;ary Diverti&s;ement. The
King &s;aid, it proceeded not from thence; and that He might take Occa|&s;ion
from his Ab&s;ence from thence, to let him&s;elf into that Di&s;cour&s;e; and
afterwards proceed as He thought fit.<MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>THE Duke was a Per&s;on of a very good Under&s;tanding;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Character of the Duke of</HI> Richmond.</NOTE> and of &s;o great
Perfection, and Punctuality in all Matters of Hone&s;ty, and Honour, that
He was infinitely &s;uperior to any kind of Temptation. He had all the
Warmth, and Pa&s;&s;ions of a Subject, and a Servant, and a Friend for the
King, and for his Per&s;on; but He was then a Man of a high Spirit; and
valued his very Fidelity at the Rate it was worth; and not the le&s;s, for
that it had almo&s;t &s;tood &s;ingle for &s;ome Time. The Chancellor was very
&s;orry for this Di&s;covery; and cho&s;e to wait upon the Duke the &s;ame Day,
near the Hour when the Meeting u&s;ed to be at <HI>Oriel</HI> College: And when
He had &s;pent a &s;hort Time with him, He &s;aid, He thought it was Time<MILESTONE N="20">
to go to <HI>Oriel</HI> College, and a&s;ked his Grace, whether He would plea&s;e to
go thither; for which He making &s;ome Excu&s;e, the other pre&s;&s;ed him
with &s;ome Earne&s;tne&s;s, and &s;aid, it was ob&s;erved that He had a good Time
declined that Meeting, and if He &s;hould not now go thither, He &s;hould
be doubtful there was &s;ome Rea&s;on for it.</P>
<P>THE Duke replied, that He had indeed been ab&s;ent from thence for
&s;ome Time, and that He would deal clearly with him as his Friend, but
de&s;ired it &s;hould not be known; that He was re&s;olved to be there no more.
Then complained, that the King was not kind to him; at lea&s;t had not
that Confidence in him, which He had u&s;ed to have: And then &s;pake of<MILESTONE N="30">
many Particulars loo&s;ely; and e&s;pecially, that before the Treaty, He had
advi&s;ed the King to u&s;e all the Means He could to draw them to a Treaty,
for many Advantages which were like to be gotten by it; and to that Pur|po&s;e,
produced a Letter that He had newly received from the Counte&s;s of
<HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> and read it to his Maje&s;ty, who then &s;eemed not to be moved
with the Contents; but afterwards in &s;everal Di&s;cour&s;es reflected upon it
in &s;uch a Manner, as if He were jealous, that the Duke held too much
Corre&s;pondence with that People: Which He looked upon, as &s;uch a Point
of Diffidence, that it was no longer fit for him to be pre&s;ent, when the
&s;ecret Part of his Affairs was tran&s;acted; and &s;o He had, and would for|bear<MILESTONE N="40">
to meet in that Place, till his Maje&s;ty &s;hould entertain a better Opi|nion
of him: yet He concealed the Trouble of Mind which He &s;u&s;tained;
and wi&s;hed, that no Notice might be taken of it.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor told him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whom $e $word$ to reconcile to the King;</NOTE> it was too late for that Caution; that the
Lords them&s;elves could not but ob&s;erve his long Ab&s;ence, who before u&s;ed
to be the mo&s;t punctual; and confe&s;&s;ed to him, that the King him&s;elf had
&s;poken to him of it with a Sen&s;e of Wonder, and Di&s;like; which, He &s;aid,
He was to blame him&s;elf for; &s;ince the Honour He had done him to the
King, had likewi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed his Maje&s;ty to tru&s;t him &s;o far, as to expre&s;s
&s;ome Di&s;&s;atisfaction He had in his Grace's late Carriage and Behaviour. The<MILESTONE N="50">
Duke &s;eemed not di&s;plea&s;ed with the Communication, but thereupon en|tered
into a fuller, and warmer Di&s;cour&s;e than before; how much the King
had withdrawn his Confidence from him, and tru&s;ted others much more
<PB N="95" REF="102">
than him. In Sum, it was ea&s;y to di&s;cern, that the Thing that troubled
him, was the Power and Credit that <HI>John A&s;hburnham</HI> had with the
King; which his Vanity made him own to that Degree, that He was not
content to enjoy the Benefit of it, except He made it publick, and to be
taken Notice of by all Men; which could not but reflect upon his Ho|nour:
And when the Chancellor &s;eemed to think it impo&s;&s;ible, that him|&s;elf
could believe, that the King could prefer a Man of Mr. <HI>A&s;hburnham</HI>'s
Talent, before his Grace; He proceeded with many In&s;tances, and in|&s;i&s;ted
with mo&s;t Indignation upon one.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10">THAT about a Year before, Sir <HI>John Lucas,</HI> who was well known to his
Grace, having met him abroad in his Travels, and ever after paid a par|ticular
Re&s;pect to him, had applied him&s;elf to him, and de&s;ired his Favour,
that when there &s;hould be any Opportunity offered, He would recommend
him to the King, to whom He was not unknown; that his Affection to
his Maje&s;ty's Service was notorious enough, and that his Sufferings were &s;o
likewi&s;e; his Hou&s;e being the fir&s;t that was plundered in the beginning of
the War; by which, the Lo&s;s He &s;u&s;tained in Furniture, Plate, Money,
and Stock, was very con&s;iderable; &s;o that He might mode&s;tly hope, that
when his Maje&s;ty &s;cattered his Favours upon others of his own Rank, his
<MILESTONE N="20">poor Service might likewi&s;e be remembered: But He had &s;een Men rai&s;ed
to Dignities, who He was fure had not the Advantage over him in their
Sufferings, whatever They might have in their Actings; and He de&s;ired
no more, but (&s;ince it was too evident that his Maje&s;ty's Wants were
great, and that Money would do him &s;ome Service) that He might re|ceive
that Degree of Honour which others had, and He would make
&s;uch a Pre&s;ent to him, as &s;hould manife&s;t his Gratitude; and He de&s;ired
to owe the Obligation to his Grace, and to receive it only by his Me|diation.</P>
<P>HE &s;aid, He had moved this Matter, with the Relation of all the Cir|cum&s;tances,
<MILESTONE N="30">to his Maje&s;ty, who &s;pake very graciou&s;ly of the Gentleman,
as a Per&s;on of Merit, but &s;aid, He was re&s;olved to make no more Lords;
which He received as a very good An&s;wer, and looked upon as a good
Re&s;olution, and commended it; de&s;iring only, that if at any Time his
Maje&s;ty found it nece&s;&s;ary to vary from that Re&s;olution, He would re|member
his Propo&s;ition, and gratify that Gentleman; which He promi&s;ed
to do; and with all which He acquainted the Per&s;on concerned; think|ing
it could not but well &s;atisfy him. But He told him, that He was
&s;orry that He could not receive the Honour, by his Grace's Recommen|dation;
but for the Thing it &s;elf, He could have it when He would; and
<MILESTONE N="40">&s;hortly after it was di&s;patched by Mr. <HI>A&s;hburnham.</HI> He a&s;ked, whether
this was not preferring Mr. <HI>A&s;hburnham</HI> very much before him. The Chan|cellor
told him, He was preferred as the better Market Man; and that He
ought not to believe, that the King's Affection &s;wayed him to that Pre|ference,
but an Opinion, that the other would make the better Bargain.
He replied, his Maje&s;ty was deceived in that, for He had told him what
the other meant to give, without the lea&s;t Thought of re&s;erving any Thing
for him&s;elf; whereas his Maje&s;ty had now received five hundred Pounds
le&s;s, and his Market Man had gotten &s;o much for his Pains.</P>
<P>IN Conclu&s;ion, He prevailed &s;o far with him, that They went that Af|ternoon
<MILESTONE N="50">together to the Committee to <HI>Oriel</HI> College; and the next Day the
Chancellor &s;pake with the King again, and told him, that the Duke had
been in the Afternoon with the Committee, where many Things had been
<PB N="96" REF="103">
con&s;ulted;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And the King to the Duke of</HI> Richmond;</NOTE> and that He found, all his Trouble proceeded from an Appre|hen&s;ion,
that his Maje&s;ty had withdrawn his Affection from him; at lea&s;t
that He, the Duke, had not the &s;ame Credit with his Maje&s;ty, which He
had formerly had; and that the Sen&s;e, and Fear of that, could not but
make an Impre&s;&s;ion upon a good Servant, who loved his Ma&s;ter as well as
He did. His Maje&s;ty &s;aid, They two &s;hould not live as well together, as
They had done, as long as the Duke kept his Man <HI>Webb;</HI> who made him
believe, that the King was wholly governed by <HI>A&s;hburnham,</HI> and cared
not for any Body el&s;e. He &s;aid, no Body who knew him, could believe
He could be governed by <HI>A&s;hburnbam;</HI> who, though an hone&s;t Man, and<MILESTONE N="10">
one that He believed loved him well, no Man thought was of an Under|&s;tanding
&s;uperior to his Maje&s;ty; and enlarged him&s;elf upon this Argu|ment
&s;o much, that He &s;eemed as it were glad of the Opportunity, to clear
him&s;elf from that A&s;per&s;ion, or Imputation.</P>
<P>IT is a very great Misfortune for any Prince to be &s;u&s;pected to be go|verned
by any Man; for as the Reproach is of all others the mo&s;t grie|vous,
&s;o They think the tru&s;ting weak Men, who are much &s;hort of their
own Vigour of Wit, and Under&s;tanding, is a &s;ufficient Vindication from
that Calumny; and &s;o, before They are aware of it, They decline wi&s;er
Men, who are fit to advi&s;e them, and give them&s;elves to weaker, upon<MILESTONE N="20">
an Imagination, that no Body will ever &s;u&s;pect, They can be governed
by them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">But without Succe&s;s.</NOTE> In Fine, He found the Work too hard for him; the King being
&s;o much incen&s;ed again&s;t <HI>Webb,</HI> that He expected the Duke &s;hould turn
him away: and the Duke him&s;elf, looked upon the King's Prejudice, as
infu&s;ed into him by <HI>A&s;hburnham,</HI> upon particular Malice; having often
de&s;ired, that &s;ome Accu&s;er might charge <HI>Webb,</HI> and He be heard to an|&s;wer
for him&s;elf; which the King not being willing to admit, the other was
unwilling to di&s;mi&s;s a Servant, his Secretary, who had &s;erved him long,
and was very u&s;eful to him; and who indeed was never &s;u&s;pected for any
Infidelity, or Want of Affection to his Ma&s;ter: and &s;o the Chancellor, to<MILESTONE N="30">
his great Trouble, was not able to remove that Cloudine&s;s that remained
in both their Countenances; which never produced the lea&s;t ill Effect in
the View or Ob&s;ervation of any; the Duke's Duty being never in any
Degree dimini&s;hed; and the King's Kindne&s;s to him continuing with
many gracious Evidences, to his Death.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t Conference his Maje&s;ty had with the Chancellor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ King's l$&s;t Conference with the Chancellor of the Exche|quer.</NOTE> was the
very Day the Prince began his Journey towards the We&s;t, and indeed
after He had received his Ble&s;&s;ing; when his Maje&s;ty &s;ent for him into his
Bedchamber; and repeated &s;ome Things he had mentioned before. He
told him, &startq;there had been many Things which had troubled him, with<MILESTONE N="40">
Reference to his Son's Ab&s;ence from him; for all which, but one, He
had &s;atisfied him&s;elf: the one was, the Inconvenience which might
ari&s;e from the Weakne&s;s and Folly of his Governor; again&s;t which He
had provided, as well as He could, by obliging the Prince to follow the
Advice of his Council in all Things; which He was well a&s;&s;ured He
would do; and He had given them as much Authority, as They could
wi&s;h. Another was, that there was one Servant about the Prince, who
He thought, had too much Credit with him, which was <HI>Elliot;</HI> who
He did not intend &s;hould be with him in the Journey; and had there|fore
&s;ent him into <HI>France</HI> to the Queen, with Direction to her Maje&s;ty,<MILESTONE N="50">
to keep him there; and if He &s;hould return whil&s;t the Prince remained
in the We&s;t, that He &s;hould be &s;ent to his Maje&s;ty; and not &s;uffered to
&s;tay with his Highne&s;s; and that was all the Care He could take in
<PB N="97" REF="104">
tho&s;e two Particulars: But there was a Third, in which He knew not
what to do, and that troubled him much more than the other two.&endq;
When the Chancellor &s;eemed full of Expectation to know what that might
be, the King &s;aid, &startq;I have ob&s;erved of late &s;ome kind of Sharpne&s;s, upon
many Occa&s;ions, between <HI>Colepepper</HI> and you; and though you are
joined with other hone&s;t Men, yet my great Confidence is upon you
two: I know not that the Fault is in you; nay, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that it
is very often in him; but let it be where it will, any Difference, and
Unkindne&s;s between you two, mu&s;t be at my Charge; And I mu&s;t tell
<MILESTONE N="10">you the Fear I have of it, gives me much Trouble: I have &s;poken very
plainly to him my Apprehen&s;ion in this Point, within this Hour; and
He hath made as fair Promi&s;es to me as I can wi&s;h; and upon my Con|&s;cience
I think, He loves you, though He may &s;ometimes provoke you
to be angry.&endq;</P>
<P>THE King here making a Pau&s;e, the Chancellor, out of Countenance,
&s;aid, &startq;He was very &s;orry, that He had ever given his Maje&s;ty any Occa|&s;ion
for &s;uch an Apprehen&s;ion; but very glad, that He had vouch&s;afed
to inform him of it; becau&s;e He believed He &s;hould give his Maje&s;ty
&s;uch A&s;&s;urance in that Particular, as would fully &s;atisfy him: He a&s;&s;u|red
<MILESTONE N="20">his Maje&s;ty, that He had a great E&s;teem of the Lord <HI>Colepepper;</HI>
and though He might have at &s;ome Times Pa&s;&s;ions which were incon|venient,
He was &s;o confident of him&s;elf, that they &s;hould not provoke,
or di&s;turb him, that He was well content, that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould con|demn,
and think him in the Fault, if any Thing &s;hould fall out, of Pre|judice
to his Service, from a Difference between them two.&endq; With which
his Maje&s;ty appeared abundantly &s;atisfied, and plea&s;ed; and embracing
him, gave him his Hand to ki&s;s; and He immediately went to Hor&s;e, and
followed the Prince: And this was the la&s;t Time the Chancellor ever &s;aw
that gracious and excellent King.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30">IT was upon the 4th of <HI>March,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel|lor attends the Prince into the We&s;t; and is there fir&s;t a&s;&s;aulted by the Gout.</NOTE> in the Year 1644, that the Prince

Whil&s;t the Lords <HI>Capel,</HI> and <HI>Hopton</HI> &s;taid there, They lived, and kept
Hou&s;e together in St. <HI>Hillary</HI>'s; which is the chief Town of the I&s;land;

him&s;elf in &s;uch a Ve&s;&s;el, and &s;ince the Fleet that had declared for the King<MILESTONE N="40">

<P>THE Chancellor, who knew nothing of the Sea, nor under&s;tood the

Mar&s;hal <HI>Rantzaw</HI> was then Governor. And They no &s;ooner landed in the

Fleet; and that He was &s;ent by his Highne&s;s to the Mar&s;hal for a Fri|gate,

<MILESTONE N="10">De&s;ign upon the Enemy; and was newly arrived, and gone to Bed) had
promi&s;ed him that the Frigate &s;hould be ready the next Day. This &s;eemed
an extraordinary good Fortune to them, that They might now embark di|rectly
for the Fleet, without going into <HI>Holland,</HI> which They were willing
to avoid; and &s;o re&s;olved to &s;peak with the Mar&s;hal as &s;oon as They could,

Night, by Rea&s;on of the Fatigue He had undergone the Night before, and
that Day; and to oblige them to dine with him the next Day, again&s;t
which Time the Ve&s;&s;el would be made ready to receive them, and tran&s;|port

who had been mo&s;t bu&s;y about them; which were immediately &s;eized on,
and &s;earched, and about &s;ome of them &s;ome Pieces of Chains of Gold, and
other Things of Value belonging to the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> were found; and
&s;ome Mails, in which were Linen, and Cloaths, all which were pre&s;ently
re&s;tored and delivered to &s;ome of the Servants, who were pre&s;ent, and
brought them to their Ma&s;ters. The Chancellor was more &s;olicitous for
&s;ome Papers He had lo&s;t, than for his Money; and He was u&s;ed to &s;ay,
that He looked upon it as a &s;ingular Act of Providence, that tho&s;e Officers
<MILESTONE N="30">prevailed with a Seaman, who had taken it out of his Pocket, to re&s;tore
a little Letter which He had lately received from the King, whil&s;t He
was in the Hands of the Army; which for the Grace and Kindne&s;s con|tained
in it, He did ever exceedingly value.</P>
<P>THOSE of the Admiralty, though They had not yet found out either
any of the Jewels, or Money, of which They had been robbed, thought
They had done enough for the Morning; and &s;o returned to Dinner; de|claring
that They would return in the Afternoon; and directed the Ships
to be drawn nearer together, to the End They might vi&s;it them together;
and They did return in the Afternoon, accompanied as before, but their
<MILESTONE N="40">Reception by the Seamen was not as in the Morning. The Captains an|&s;wered
tho&s;e Que&s;tions which were a&s;ked of them negligently, and &s;corn|fully;
and tho&s;e Seamen who had been &s;earched in the Morning, and were
appointed to be produced in the Afternoon to be further examined, could
not be found; and in&s;tead of bringing the Ships nearer together, &s;ome of
them were gone more out to Sea; and the re&s;t declared, that They would
go all out to Sea that Night; and when the Magi&s;trates &s;eemed to threaten
them, They &s;wore They would throw both them, and all who came with
them, over Board; and offered to lay Hands upon them in Order to it;
&s;o that They were all glad to get off; and returned to the Town, talking
<MILESTONE N="50">loud what Vengeance They would take upon the Captains and Seamen
when They returned again into Port (for They already &s;tood out to Sea in
their Sight) and in the mean Time They would pro&s;ecute the Owners of
the Ve&s;&s;els, who &s;hould &s;atisfy for the Damage received; but from this
<PB N="108" REF="115">
Time, the Governor, nor the Lords of Admiralty cared to come near
them: And They quickly found that the Rea&s;on of all the Governor's Ci|vility
the fir&s;t Night, and the many Que&s;tions He had a&s;ked concerning all
the Particulars They had lo&s;t of any Kind, was only to be the better in|formed,
to demand his Share from the Seamen; and that the Lords of the
Admiralty were the Owners of the &s;everal Ve&s;&s;els, or had Shares in them,
and in the victualling, and &s;o were to divide the Spoil, which They pre|tended
&s;hould be re&s;tored. So that after They had remained there four, or
five Days,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But cannot obtain it.</NOTE> They were contented to receive one hundred Pi&s;toles for di&s;|charging
the Debts They had contracted in the Town (for there was not<MILESTONE N="10">
any Money left among&s;t them) and to carry them to the Prince; which
tho&s;e of the Admiralty pretended to have received from &s;ome of the
Owners, and to wait for farther Ju&s;tice, when the Ships &s;hould return,
which They doubted not &s;hould be effectually called for, by the Com|mands
of the Arch-Duke, when He &s;hould be informed: and &s;o They
pro&s;ecuted their Journey to the Prince, making their Way by <HI>Bruges,</HI> and
from thence by the Way of <HI>Sluys</HI> to <HI>Flu&s;hing;</HI> and tho&s;e hundred Pi&s;toles
were the only Recompence that They ever received for that Affront, and
Damage They had &s;u&s;tained; which in the whole amounted to two thou|&s;and
Pounds at the lea&s;t; though the King's Re&s;ident <HI>De-Vic</HI> at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI><MILESTONE N="20">
pro&s;ecuted the Pretence with the Arch-Duke, as long as there was any
Hope.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor was often u&s;ed to relate an Ob&s;ervation that was ge|nerally
made, and di&s;cour&s;ed at <HI>O&s;tend,</HI> at that Time, that never any Man
who adventured in &s;etting out tho&s;e Frigates of Rapine, which are called
Men of War, or in victualling, or bearing any Share in them, died rich,
or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any valuable E&s;tate: and that as He walked one Morning
about the Town, and upon the Quay, with an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Officer, who was a
Lieutenant in that Garri&s;on, They &s;aw a poor old Man walk by them,
whom the Lieutenant de&s;ired the Chancellor to ob&s;erve; and when He<MILESTONE N="30">
was pa&s;&s;ed by, He told him, that He had known that Man the riche&s;t of
any Man in the Town; that He had been the Owner of above ten Ships
of War at one Time, without any Partner or Sharer with him; that He
had had in his Warehou&s;es in the Town, as much Goods, and Merchan|di&s;e
together, as amounted to the Value of one hundred thou&s;and Pounds,
within &s;even Years before the Time He was then &s;peaking; and after the
Lo&s;s of two or three Frigates, He in&s;en&s;ibly decayed &s;o fa&s;t, that having
begun to build another Frigate, which He &s;hewed him as They walked,
and which lay then not half fini&s;hed, He was not able to go through with
it, and that He was at that Time &s;o poor, that He had not wherewith to<MILESTONE N="40">
maintain him; but received the Charity of tho&s;e who had known him in
a plentiful E&s;tate: And this Relation He made in Confirmation of that
Di&s;cour&s;e and Ob&s;ervation; and it made &s;o deep an Impre&s;&s;ion upon the
Chancellor, that afterwards, when the War was between <HI>England,</HI> and
<HI>Holland,</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> and when many Gentlemen thought it good Hu&s;|bandry
to adventure in the &s;etting out &s;uch Ships of War, He always di&s;|&s;waded
his Friends from that Traffick, relating to them this Story, of the
Truth whereof He had &s;uch Evidence; and did in Truth, moreover in his
own Judgment believe, that all Engagements of that Kind were contrary
to the Rules of Ju&s;tice, and a good Con&s;cience.<MILESTONE N="50"></P>
<P>WHEN They came to <HI>Flu&s;hing,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He goes to</HI> Flu&s;hing&punc;</NOTE> They thought it be&s;t to &s;tay there, as

&s;ent from the Fleet, for their tran&s;portation; and <HI>Carteret</HI> was already di&s;|patched,
to inform the Prince of what had befallen the Trea&s;urer, and

<MILESTONE N="10">them to the Fleet; with Direction that They &s;hould make as much Ha&s;te

repo&s;ed in him. They who loved him were &s;orry for him, and them&s;elves;

They throw with all the Strength They can; and again&s;t them They de|fend
them&s;elves with very broad Bucklers; and as &s;oon as They have
thrown their Darts, They wheel about in a full Gallop, till They can turn
to receive the like A&s;&s;ault from tho&s;e whom They had charged; and &s;o
&s;everal Squadrons of twenty, or five and twenty Hor&s;e, run round, and
charge each other. It hath at fir&s;t the Appearance of a Martial Exerci&s;e;

<P>THE next Day,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De&s;cription of the</HI> Toros.</NOTE> and &s;o for two or three Days together, both the Am|ba&s;&s;adors
<MILESTONE N="30">had a Box prepared for them, to &s;ee the <HI>Toros;</HI> which is a Spec|tacle
very wonderful. Here the Place was very noble, being the Market|place,
a very large Square, built with hand&s;ome Brick Hou&s;es, which had
all Balconies, which were adorned with Tape&s;try, and very beautiful La|dies.
Scaffolds were built round to the fir&s;t Story; the lower Rooms
being Shops, and for ordinary U&s;e; and in the divi&s;ion of tho&s;e Scaffolds,
all the Magi&s;trates, and Officers of the Town knew their Places. The
Pavement of the Place was all covered with Gravel, which in Summer
Time was upon tho&s;e Occa&s;ions watered by Carts charged with Hog&s;heads
of Water. As &s;oon as the King comes, &s;ome Officers clear the whole
<MILESTONE N="40">Ground from the Common People; &s;o that there is no Man &s;een upon the
Plain, but two or three <HI>Alguazills,</HI> Magi&s;trates with their &s;mall white
Wands. Then one of the four Gates which lead into the Streets is opened;
at which the <HI>Torreadors</HI> enter, all Per&s;ons of Quality richly clad, and upon
the be&s;t Hor&s;es in <HI>Spain,</HI> every one attended by eight, or ten, or more
Lackeys, all clinquant with Gold, and Silver Lace; who carry the Spears,
which their Ma&s;ters are to u&s;e again&s;t the Bulls; and with this Entry
many of the common People break in, for which &s;ometimes They pay
very dear. The Per&s;ons on Hor&s;eback have all Cloaks &s;olded up upon
their left Shoulder; the lea&s;t Di&s;order of which, much more the letting
<MILESTONE N="50">it fall, is a very great Di&s;grace; and in that grave Order, They march to
the Place where the King &s;its, and after They have made the Reverences,
They place them&s;elves at a good Di&s;tance from one another, and expect
the Bull.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="121">
THE Bulls are brought in the Night before from the Mountains, by
People u&s;ed to that Work; who drive them into the Town when no Body
is in the Streets, into a Pen made for them, which hath a Door that opens
into that large Space; the Key whereof is &s;ent to the King, which the
King, when He &s;ees every Thing ready, throws to an <HI>Alguazill,</HI> who
carries it to the Officer that keeps the Door; and He cau&s;es it to be open|ed
when a &s;ingle Bull is ready to come out. When the Bull enters, the
common People who fit over the Door, or near it, &s;trike him, or throw
&s;hort Darts with &s;harp Points of Steel to provoke him to Rage: He com|monly
runs with all his Fury again&s;t the fir&s;t Man he &s;ees on Hor&s;eback;<MILESTONE N="10">
who watches him &s;o carefully, and avoids him &s;o dexterou&s;ly, that when
the Spectators believe him to be even between the Horns of the Bull, He
avoids him by the quick Turn of his Hor&s;e; and with his Lance &s;trikes
the Bull upon a Vein that runs through his Pole, with which in a Mo|ment
he falls down dead. But this fatal Stroke can never be &s;truck, but
when the Bull comes &s;o near upon the Turn of the Hor&s;e, that his Horn
even touches the Rider's Leg; and &s;o is at &s;uch a Di&s;tance, that He can
&s;horten his Lance, and u&s;e the full Strength of his Arm in the Blow; and
They who are the mo&s;t &s;kilful in the Exerci&s;e, do frequently kill the Bea&s;t
with &s;uch an exact Stroke: in&s;omuch as in a Day, two, or three fall in<MILESTONE N="20">
that Manner: But if They mi&s;s the Vein, it only gives a Wound that the
more enrages him.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES the Bull runs with &s;o much Fiercene&s;s (for if he e&s;capes the
fir&s;t Man, he runs upon the re&s;t as They are in his Way) that he gores the
Hor&s;e with his Horns, &s;o that his Guts come out, and He falls, before the
Rider can get from his Back. Sometimes, by the Strength of his Neck,
he rai&s;es Hor&s;e and Man from the Ground, and throws both down; and
then the greate&s;t Danger is another Gore upon the Ground. In any of
the&s;e Di&s;graces, or any other, by which the Rider comes to be di&s;mounted,
He is obliged in Honour to take his Revenge upon the Bull by his Sword,<MILESTONE N="30">
and upon his Head; towards which the Standers by a&s;&s;i&s;t him, by run|ning
after the Bull, and hocking him, by which he falls upon his hinder
Legs, but before that Execution can be done, a good Bull hath his Re|venge
upon many poor Fellows. Sometimes he is &s;o unruly that no Body
dares to attack him; and then the King calls for the Ma&s;tiffs, whereof
two are let out at a Time, and if they cannot ma&s;ter him, but are them|&s;elves
killed, as frequently they are, the King then, as the la&s;t Refuge,
calls for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ma&s;tiffs, of which They &s;eldom turn out above one at
a Time, and he rarely mi&s;&s;es taking the Bull, and holding him by the No&s;e,
till the Men run in; and after They have hocked him, They quickly kill<MILESTONE N="40">
him.</P>
<P>IN one of tho&s;e Days there were no fewer than &s;ixteen Hor&s;es, as good
as any in <HI>Spain,</HI> the wor&s;t of which would that very Morning have yielded
three hundred Pi&s;toles, killed, and four or five Men; be&s;ides many more
of both hurt, and &s;ome Men remained perpetually maimed: for after the
Hor&s;emen have done as much as They can, They withdraw them&s;elves,
and then &s;ome accu&s;tomed nimble Fellows to whom Money is thrown,
when They perform their Feats with Skill, &s;tand to receive the Bulls,
whereof the wor&s;t are re&s;erved till the la&s;t; and it is a wonderful Thing
to &s;ee with what Steadine&s;s tho&s;e Fellows will &s;tand a full Career of the<MILESTONE N="50">
Bull, and by a little quick Motion upon one Foot, avoid him, and lay a
Hand upon his Horn, as if They guided him from them; but then the
next Standers by, who have not the &s;ame Activity, commonly pay for it;
<PB N="115" REF="122">
and there is no Day without much Mi&s;chief. It is a very barbarous Exer|ci&s;e,

ventured; but &s;o rooted in the Affections of that Nation, that it is not in
the King's Power, They &s;ay, to &s;uppre&s;s it; though if He di&s;liked it
enough, He might forbear to be pre&s;ent at it.</P>
<P>THERE are three Fe&s;tival Days in the Year, whereof <HI>Mid&s;ummer</HI> is one,
on which the People hold it to be their Right to be treated with the&s;e

probably with his Approbation, if not upon his De&s;ire, publi&s;hed a Bull
again&s;t the <HI>Toros</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> which is &s;till in force; in which He declared,
that no Body &s;hould be capable of <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Burial, who lo&s;t his Life at
tho&s;e Spectacles; and that every Clergyman who &s;hould be pre&s;ent at

the Clergy, which is always filled; be&s;ides that many Religious Men in
their Habits get other Places; only the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> out of their Submi&s;&s;ion to
the &s;upreme Authority of the Pope, are never pre&s;ent there; but on tho&s;e

obliges their whole Body to be together.</P>

keep his Bed, and to bleed, for many Days; but was &s;o impatient of

He put him&s;elf into a Litter, and reached <HI>Bourdeaux;</HI> where He was

<P>As &s;oon as He had recovered any Strength, He waited upon the Queen

<MILESTONE N="50">&s;eemed mo&s;t offended with Sir <HI>Edward Herbert</HI> the Attorney General, and
Sir <HI>George Ratcliffe,</HI> as the two Per&s;ons who prevailed with the Duke, and

<PB N="120" REF="127">
of what They had unrea&s;onably looked for at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> They had carried his
Royal Highne&s;s into <HI>Holland,</HI> to his Si&s;ter; who &s;uffered much by his Pre|&s;ence;
the States of <HI>Holland</HI> being re&s;olved not to &s;uffer him to re&s;ide within
their Province; the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> being lately dead of the Small Pox,
and his Son, who was born after his Death, being an Infant, and depending
&s;o intirely upon the good Will of the States; and therefore the Prince&s;s
Royal was much troubled that the coming of the Duke her Brother into
tho&s;e Parts, gave the States any Occa&s;ion of Offence. The Queen &s;aid, that
She had writ to the Duke to return into <HI>France,</HI> but had received no An|&s;wer;
and therefore She de&s;ired the Amba&s;&s;ador, as &s;oon as He &s;hould<MILESTONE N="10">
come into tho&s;e Parts (for He meant to go to <HI>Antwerp,</HI> where his Wife

reduce the Duke, and to prevail with him to return into <HI>France;</HI> which
the Amba&s;&s;ador could not refu&s;e to promi&s;e.</P>
<P>HE found there the Queen's own Family in &s;ome Di&s;order, upon &s;ome
Declaration She had made, that the Prote&s;tant Chaplain &s;hould be no
more permitted to perform his Function in the <HI>Louvre;</HI> where the Queen's
Court re&s;ided, and where there was a lower Room which had been always
u&s;ed as a Chapel, from the Time of the Prince's fir&s;t coming thither, to
that Time; and where twice a Day, the Common Prayer was read to<MILESTONE N="20">
tho&s;e who were Prote&s;tants, in both Families; and now the Queen had
&s;ignified to Dr. <HI>Co&s;ins</HI> (who was the Chaplain a&s;&s;igned by the late King,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dr.</HI> Co&s;ins <HI>forbid to offi|ciate to the Prote&s;tants in the Queen's Family.</HI></NOTE> to

<P>THE Chancellor of the Exchequer took this Occa&s;ion to &s;peak with
the Queen;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel|lor &s;peaks to the Queen on that Subject.</NOTE> and put her in Mind of &s;ome Promi&s;e She had made him,
when He took his Leave of her to go for <HI>Spain,</HI> that She would not with|draw
her Stipend, which She allowed to Dr. <HI>Co&s;ins;</HI> whereby He mu&s;t be

be deprived of their publick Devotions; which Promi&s;e She had ob&s;erved<MILESTONE N="30">
to that Time: But if now the Room &s;hould be taken from that U&s;e, it
would be the &s;ame Thing, as if the Chaplain was turned away. He put
her Maje&s;ty in Mind of the ill Impre&s;&s;ion it might make in the Hearts of
the Prote&s;tants in <HI>England,</HI> who retained their Re&s;pects, and Duty for her
Maje&s;ty; and of what pernicious Con&s;equence it might prove to the King,
who was &s;till in <HI>Scotland,</HI> in a hopeful Condition; and depended mo&s;t
upon the Affections of his Prote&s;tant Subjects of <HI>England;</HI> and in the la&s;t

&s;u&s;pected by her to mi&s;lead the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> to di&s;&s;uade him from re|turning
to her, &s;ince She would not permit him to have the Exerci&s;e of his<MILESTONE N="40">

which She did not believe to be &s;ea&s;onable.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Walter Montague,</HI> who had &s;ome Years ago changed his Religion,
and was become Catholick, after He had &s;u&s;tained a long Impri&s;onment
in the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> procured his Relea&s;e from thence, upon A&s;&s;u|rance
that He would no more return into <HI>England;</HI> and &s;o came into
<HI>France,</HI> where He was very well known in the <HI>French,</HI> as well, as the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court, and in great Reputation, and E&s;teem with both Queens.
He appeared a Man wholly re&s;trained from all the Vanity, and Levity<MILESTONE N="50">
of his former Life; and perfectly mortified to the Plea&s;ures of the World,
which He had enjoyed in a very great Mea&s;ure and Exce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="128">
HE dedicated him&s;elf to his Studies with great Au&s;terity; and &s;eemed
to have no Affection, or Ambition for Preferment; but to live within
him&s;elf upon the very moderate Exhibition He had left to him by his Fa|ther;
and in this melancholick Retreat He had newly taken the Order of
Prie&s;thood; which was in Truth, the mo&s;t rea&s;onable Way to &s;atisfy his
Ambition, if He had any left; for both the Queen Regent, and the Car|dinal,
could not but liberally provide for his Support, in that Profe&s;&s;ion;
which They did very &s;hortly after: and this devout Profe&s;&s;ion, and new
Function much improved the Intere&s;t, and Credit He always had in his old
<MILESTONE N="10">Mi&s;tre&s;s; who very much hearkened to him in Ca&s;es of Con&s;cience: and
She confe&s;&s;ed to the Chancellor, that He was a little too bigotted in this
Affair; and had not only pre&s;&s;ed her very pa&s;&s;ionately to remove the Scan|dal
of having a Prote&s;tant Chapel in her Hou&s;e, as incon&s;i&s;tent with a good
Con&s;cience; but had likewi&s;e inflamed the Queen Regent with the &s;ame
Zeal; who had very earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed and importuned her Maje&s;ty no
longer to permit that Offence to be given to the Catholick Religion. And
upon this Occa&s;ion She lamented the Death of her late Confe&s;&s;or, Father
<HI>Philips,</HI> who, She &s;aid, was a very di&s;creet Man, and would never &s;uffer
her to be troubled with &s;uch Infu&s;ions, and Scruples. In Conclu&s;ion, She
<MILESTONE N="20">wi&s;hed him to confer with Mr. <HI>Montague,</HI> and to try if He could with|draw
him from that A&s;perity in that Particular; to which Purpo&s;e, the
Chancellor conferred with him, but without any Effect.</P>
<P>HE &s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Chancellor confers with Mr.</HI> Monta|gue <HI>thereon&punc; but without Effect.</HI></NOTE> the Hou&s;e was the King of <HI>France</HI>'s; who only permitted the
Queen to live there; and that the Queen Regent thought her &s;elf bound
in Con&s;cience no longer to &s;uffer that Reproach, of which She had never
had Information till very lately: That if the Duke of <HI>York</HI> came thither,
there was no Thought, or Purpo&s;e to deny him the Exerci&s;e of his Reli|gion;
He might have his Chaplain &s;ay Prayers to him in his own Cham|ber;
or in &s;ome Room adjacent, which &s;erved likewi&s;e to all other Pur|po&s;es;
<MILESTONE N="30">but that the &s;etting a Room apart, as this was, for that Service,
was upon the Matter dedicating it as a Chapel, for the Exerci&s;e of a Reli|gion,
contrary to what was e&s;tabli&s;hed in that Kingdom; which the King
of <HI>France</HI> would not &s;uffer to be done in a Hou&s;e of his, though the King
&s;hould return thither again. He undervalued all the Con&s;iderations which
were offered of <HI>England,</HI> or of a Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t; as if He thought
them all, as no Doubt He did, of no Importance to the King's Re&s;tora|tion,
which could never be effected but by that Intere&s;t which was quite
oppo&s;ite to it. When He gave the Queen an Account of this Di&s;cour&s;e,
He prevailed &s;o far with her, that She promi&s;ed, in Ca&s;e She &s;hould be
<MILESTONE N="40">compelled to take away that Room, as She &s;ore&s;aw She &s;hould be, the Fa|mily

&s;erve for all the re&s;t to re&s;ort to.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Chancellor had recovered his &s;trength, He took Leave of
the Queen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancell$r goe$ to <HI>Bru&s;|&s;els.</HI></NOTE> and pur&s;ued his Journey for <HI>Flanders.</HI> At <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> He &s;taid

the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and Don <HI>Lewis;</HI> by which the King &s;ignified his Plea|&s;ure,
that He &s;hould re&s;ide any where in tho&s;e Provinces He be&s;t liked,
until He could conveniently repair to the King his Ma&s;ter; and that in the
<MILESTONE N="50">mean Time He &s;hould enjoy all the Privileges due to an Amba&s;&s;ador: And
&s;o He had his Audience in that Quality. He &s;pake in <HI>Latin,</HI> and the

to his Family at <HI>Antwerp,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And re&s;ides with his Fa|mily at</HI> Ant|werp <HI>in the Character of Amba&s;&s;ador.</HI></NOTE> and kept that Character till the King's coming
into <HI>France,</HI> and his Return to him; by Means whereof He enjoyed many
Privileges, and Exemptions in the Town; and had the Freedom of his
Chapel, not only for his own Devotions, but for the Re&s;ort of all the Pro|te&s;tants,
who were then in the Town; whereof the Marquis of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI>
the Earl of <HI>Norwich,</HI> and Sir <HI>Charles Cavendi&s;h</HI> were the principal; who
came always on the <HI>Sundays,</HI> and frequently on the Week Days, to the
Common Prayer, to the Grief of many <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Roman Catho|licks;
who u&s;ed all the malicious Artifices They could, to procure that
Liberty to be re&s;trained; and which could not have been enjoyed under<MILESTONE N="10">
any other Conce&s;&s;ion, than by the Privilege of an Amba&s;&s;ador.</P>
<P>WHILST He was preparing to make a Journey to the <HI>Hague</HI> to wait
upon the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> according to the Promi&s;e He had made to the
Queen, He received Information from the <HI>Hague,</HI> that his Royal High|ne&s;s
would be at <HI>Breda</HI> &s;uch a Day;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He goes to the Duke of</HI> York <HI>at</HI> Breda, <HI>to per&s;uade him to return to</HI> Paris.</NOTE> whereupon He was glad to &s;horten
his Journey, and at the Day, to ki&s;s his Hands there; where He found
his Highne&s;s newly arrived; and in an Inclination enough to return to the
Queen; &s;o that the Chancellor had no great Ta&s;k to confirm him in that
Re&s;olution; nor in Truth did He know what el&s;e to do: however all about
him were very glad of the Chancellor's Pre&s;ence, every Body hoping to get<MILESTONE N="20">
him to their Party, that He might be ready to make a fair Report of their
Behaviour to the King; whom They knew the Queen would endeavour
to incen&s;e again&s;t them.</P>
<P>NEVER little Family was torn into &s;o many Pieces and Factions.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Some account of the Duke of</HI> York'<HI>s Fa|mily.</HI></NOTE> The
Duke was very young; yet loved Intrigues &s;o well, that He was too much
inclined to hearken to any Men, who had the Confidence to make bold
Propo&s;itions to him. The King had appointed him to remain with the
Queen; and to obey her in all Things, Religion only excepted. The
Lord <HI>Byron</HI> was his Governour, ordained to be &s;o by his Father, and very
fit for that Province; being a very fine Gentleman; well bred both in<MILESTONE N="30">
<HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Italy;</HI> and perfectly ver&s;ed in both Languages; of great
Courage, and Fidelity; and in all Re&s;pects qualified for the Tru&s;t; but his
being ab&s;ent in the King's Service, when the Duke made his E&s;cape out of
<HI>England,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Berkley</HI> being then put about him, all Pains had
been taken to le&s;&s;en his E&s;teem of the Lord <HI>Byron;</HI> and Sir <HI>John Berkley</HI>
knowing that He could no longer remain Governour, when the Lord <HI>Byron</HI>
came thither; and hearing that He was in his Journey, infu&s;ed into the
Duke's Mind, that it was a great le&s;&s;ening of his Dignity at that Age (when
He was not above fourteen Years of Age, and backward enough for that
Age) to be under a Governour; and &s;o partly by di&s;e&s;teeming the Per&s;on,<MILESTONE N="40">
and partly by reproaching the Office, He grew le&s;s inclined to the Per&s;on
of that good Lord, than He &s;hould have been.</P>
<P>BUT what Title &s;oever any Body had, the whole Authority was in the
Queen; not only by the Direction of the King, but by inevitable Nece&s;|&s;ity;
for there was no Kind of Fund a&s;&s;igned for the Support of the Duke;
but He depended entirely upon the Queen his Mother's Bounty, who had
no more a&s;&s;igned for her &s;elf, than They, to whom the Management there|of
was committed, knew well how to di&s;po&s;e of, nor was it enough to &s;erve
their Occa&s;ions; &s;o that her Maje&s;ty her &s;elf, certainly &s;pent le&s;s upon her
own Per&s;on, or in any Thing relating to her &s;elf, than ever any Queen,<MILESTONE N="50">
or Lady of a very eminent Degree did. This vi&s;ible, and total Depen|dance
of the Duke upon his Mother, made her Maje&s;ty the le&s;s apprehen|&s;ive
of his doing any Thing contrary to her liking; and there was not that
<PB N="123" REF="130">
Care for the general Part of his Education; nor that Indulgence to his Per|&s;on,
as ought to have been; and the Queen's own Carriage and Behaviour
towards him was at lea&s;t &s;evere enough; as it had been before to the King,
in the Time that He was Prince; which then, and now gave Opportu|nity
to tho&s;e, who were not them&s;elves at Ea&s;e, to make many Infu&s;ions;
which how contrary &s;oever to their Duties, were not &s;o unrea&s;onable, as
to be ea&s;ily rejected, or to make no Impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE King at his going from <HI>Beauvais</HI> in his Voyage for <HI>Scotland,</HI> had
given &s;ome Recommendation to the Duke his Brother, of Sir <HI>George Rat|cliffe;</HI>
<MILESTONE N="10">to who&s;e Care his Father had once de&s;igned to commit him, when
He meant to have &s;ent him into <HI>Ireland;</HI> and his Maje&s;ty had likewi&s;e, at
the &s;ame Time at <HI>Beauvais,</HI> made &s;ome Promi&s;e to Sir <HI>George Ratcliffe</HI> of
&s;ome Place about his Brother, when his Family &s;hould be &s;ettled, of which
there was then little Appearance: however it was enough to entitle him
to give his frequent Attendance upon the Duke; and the general Reputa|tion
He had, of having been the Per&s;on of the neare&s;t Tru&s;t with the Earl
of <HI>Strafford,</HI> might well di&s;po&s;e the Duke to think him a wi&s;e Man; and
the better to e&s;teem any Thing He &s;aid to him.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Edward Herbert</HI> thought him&s;elf the wi&s;e&s;t Man that followed the
<MILESTONE N="20">King's Fortune; and was always angry that He had no more to do; and
now Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> was ab&s;ent, endeavoured all He could, to get Credit
with the Duke of <HI>York;</HI> and came very frequently to him, and held him
in long Whi&s;pers, which the Duke ea&s;ily indulged to him, out of a real
Belief that He was a Man of great Wi&s;dom, and Experience. The Queen
liked neither of the&s;e two; which They well enough di&s;cerning, grew
into a Friend&s;hip, or rather, a Familiarity together, though They were
of the mo&s;t different Natures, and Humours imaginable: <HI>Ratcliffe</HI> being
a Man very capable of Bu&s;ine&s;s; and if the Pro&s;perity of his former For|tune,
had not rai&s;ed in him &s;ome Fumes of Vanity, and Self-conceited|ne&s;s,
<MILESTONE N="30">was very fit to be advi&s;ed with; being of a Nature con&s;tant, and &s;in|cere;
which the other was not; yet They agreed well in the De&s;ign of
making the Duke of <HI>York</HI> di&s;contented, and weary of his Condition;
which was not plea&s;ant enough to be much delighted in.</P>
<P>THE news from <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Cau&s;e of the Duke of</HI> York's <HI>having left</HI> Paris.</NOTE> of the State of the King's Affairs in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
made mo&s;t Men believe that his Maje&s;ty was irrecoverably lo&s;t; and there
was for &s;ome Time a Rumour &s;cattered abroad, and by many believed, that
the King was dead. The&s;e two Gentlemen, upon the Fame of this, con|&s;ulted
together, whether if the news were, or &s;hould be true, the Duke
of <HI>York,</HI> who mu&s;t &s;ucceed, were in a good Place; and both concluded,
<MILESTONE N="40">that in that Ca&s;e, it would not be fit that He &s;hould be with his Mother.
Hereupon They per&s;uaded the Duke, that it was not fit for him to remain
idle in <HI>France;</HI> but to employ him&s;elf Abroad, whereby his Experience
might be improved; and He might put him&s;elf into a Po&s;ture to be able to
a&s;&s;i&s;t the King his Brother; or if any Misfortune &s;hould befal him, in &s;ome
Degree to provide for him&s;elf; and propo&s;ed to him, that He would re|&s;olve
to make a Journey to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> to advi&s;e and con&s;ult with the Duke
of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> who was a Prince of great Wi&s;dom, Wealth, and Courage;
and being driven out of his own Country, by too powerful and potent a
Neighbour, had yet by his own Activity, and Virtue made him&s;elf &s;o con|&s;iderable,
<MILESTONE N="50">that <HI>Spain</HI> depended upon his Army; and <HI>France</HI> it &s;elf would
be glad of his Friend&s;hip; that He was very rich, and would not be

&startq;do the King any Service, He would immediately go into <HI>England,</HI> and

<P>IT was his Fortune to come to the King very few Days before the Battle

intended to do, gave him Leave to go into the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Quarters and to re|turn
again, as He thought fit. And in a &s;hort Time after, both his Father
and his elder Brother died; whereby both the Title and the E&s;tate devolved
to him, and He was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed accordingly.</P>
<P>THE Man was before and in his Nature elate and proud enough, had a

Nobody who loved him wor&s;t ever &s;u&s;pected him to incline to the Rebels,
though They knew that He was often in their Quarters, and had often

He attended upon the Lord Lieutenant in all his Expeditions: And

When the War was at an End in <HI>England,</HI> and the King a Pri&s;oner, He
with his Wife and Family tran&s;ported him&s;elf into <HI>England,</HI> and after &s;ome
Time into <HI>Ireland;</HI> where <HI>Cromwell</HI> had a jealous Eye upon him, but
not being able to di&s;cover any Thing again&s;t him, could not hinder him
from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the E&s;tate that had de&s;cended to him from his Father and
his elder Brother. And the War being there ended, and the Settlement
made by the Act of Parliament upon the Statute, as hath been mentioned
before, there was not the lea&s;t Trouble given to him; but He quietly en|joyed
the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his whole E&s;tate till the King's Return, when He<MILESTONE N="40">
came into <HI>England</HI> to ki&s;s his Maje&s;ty's Hand, and was by him made Earl
of <HI>Tyrconnell.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;ate upon the fir&s;t Act, who ob&s;erved no
Rules of Ju&s;tice, Law or Equity, when they contradicted any Intere&s;t or
Appetite of their own, He received no Di&s;turbance; but when the&s;e new
Commi&s;&s;ioners came over, all Men, as well <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> as others, who&s;e
E&s;tates had never been que&s;tioned, thought it &s;afe&s;t for them to put in
their Claims before the Commi&s;&s;ioners, to prevent any Trouble that might
ari&s;e hereafter. This Gentleman followed that Advice and Example, put
in his Claim, and pre&s;&s;ed the Commi&s;&s;ioners for a &s;hort Day to be heard.<MILESTONE N="50">
The Day was appointed. Neither <HI>Adventurer,</HI> Soldier, or any other Per|&s;on,
made any Title to the Land: But &s;ome envious Per&s;on, unqualified for
any Pro&s;ecution, offered a Letter to the Commi&s;&s;ioners which had many
<PB N="125" REF="132">
Years before, and before his Coming into <HI>Ireland,</HI> been written by Colonel
<HI>Fitzwilliams</HI> in <HI>Paris</HI> to a <HI>Je&s;uit,</HI> one <HI>Hartogan,</HI> then in <HI>Ireland;</HI> in
which He gave him Notice &startq;of his Purpo&s;e of coming into <HI>Ireland,</HI> where
He hoped to do their Friends &s;ome Service.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS Letter was writ when the Queen fir&s;t de&s;igned to &s;end him to the
King, that the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> who were the mo&s;t jealous People of the World,
might know of his Purpo&s;e to come thither, before They &s;hould hear of
his being in <HI>Dublin;</HI> and now being produced before the Commi&s;&s;ioners,
without con&s;idering how long &s;ince it was writ or the Rea&s;on of writing it,
<MILESTONE N="10">that He had &s;erved the King, and never in the lea&s;t Degree again&s;t him,
upon one of their Rules, &startq;that a Corre&s;pondence with the Rebels was a
good Evidence,&endq; They without any Pau&s;e declared him nocent, and pre|&s;ently
a&s;&s;igned his E&s;tate to &s;ome Per&s;ons to whom Repri&s;als were to be
made: Whil&s;t They who thought the Judgment very unju&s;t, laughed at the
ill Luck of a Man whom They did not love; and all Men were well
enough plea&s;ed with the Sentence, who were di&s;plea&s;ed with the Per&s;on.
And this Party pur&s;ued him &s;o &s;everely into <HI>England,</HI> that the King's In|terpo&s;ition
to redeem him from &s;o unju&s;t a Decree, was looked upon as over|favouring
the <HI>Iri&s;h;</HI> when none were &s;o glad of the Decree as the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="20">who univer&s;ally hated him. Nor was He at la&s;t re&s;tored to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of his E&s;tate, without making &s;ome Compo&s;ition with tho&s;e to whom the
Commi&s;&s;ioners had a&s;&s;igned it.</P>
<P>MANY,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Many Decrees made upon Settlements notoriou&s;ly forged.</NOTE> who had formerly made their Claims without in&s;i&s;ting upon any
Deeds of Settlement or other Conveyances in Law, now produced former
Settlements in Con&s;ideration of Marriage, or other like good Con&s;iderations
in Law, made before the Beginning of the Rebellion: Which being now
proved by Witne&s;&s;es enough, Decrees were every Day obtained for the Re|&s;titution
of great Quantities of Land upon tho&s;e Deeds and Conveyances;
though the Forgeries of tho&s;e Deeds and Perjury of tho&s;e Witne&s;&s;es were very
<MILESTONE N="30">notorious. And &s;ome In&s;tances were given of the Manife&s;tation and direct
Proof that was made of the Forgery of Deeds, upon which Decrees had been
made, to the Satisfaction of the Commi&s;&s;ioners them&s;elves, within a very &s;hort
Time after the pronouncing tho&s;e Decrees: And yet no Reparation was
given, but the Decrees proceeded and were executed with all Rigour, as
if no &s;uch Thing had appeared.</P>
<P>THE Commi&s;&s;ioners an&s;wered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Commi&s;|&s;ioners De|fence.</NOTE> &startq;that They had made no Decrees but
according to their Con&s;ciences, and &s;uch as They were obliged to make
by the Cour&s;e and Rule of Ju&s;tice. That They did doubt and in
Truth believe, that there had been evil Practices u&s;ed both in the forging
<MILESTONE N="40">of Deeds and corrupting of Witne&s;&s;es, and that the &s;ame was equally
practi&s;ed by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> as the <HI>Iri&s;h:</HI> And therefore that They had been
obliged to make that Order, which had been &s;o much excepted again&s;t,
<HI>not to admit the Te&s;timony of any</HI> Engli&s;h Adventurer <HI>or Soldier in the Ca&s;e
of another</HI> Adventurer <HI>or Soldier;</HI> for that it was very notorious, They
looked upon the Whole as one joint Intere&s;t, and &s;o gratified each other
in their Te&s;timonies.&endq; And of this They gave many &s;ad In&s;tances, by
which it was too evident that the Perjuries were mutual, and too much
practi&s;ed by the one and the other Side.</P>
<P>&startq;THAT They had u&s;ed all the Providence and Vigilance They could, by
<MILESTONE N="50">the careful Examination of Witne&s;&s;es (which were produced apart, and
never in the Pre&s;ence of each other), and by a&s;king them all &s;uch material
Que&s;tions as occurred to their Under&s;tandings, and which They could
not expect to be a&s;ked, to di&s;cover the Truth, and to prevent and manife&s;t
<PB N="126" REF="133">
all Perjuries. That They had likewi&s;e u&s;ed their utmo&s;t Diligence and
Care, to prevent their being impo&s;ed upon with fal&s;e and forged Deeds
and Conveyances, by taking a preci&s;e and &s;trict View them&s;elves of all
Deeds produced; and interrogated the Witne&s;&s;es with all the Cunning
They could, upon the Matter and Con&s;ideration upon which &s;uch Deeds
had been entered into, and upon the Manner and Circum&s;tances in the
Execution thereof: Which was all the Providence They could u&s;e. And
though They met with many Rea&s;ons oftentimes to doubt the Integrity of
the Proceedings, and in their own private Con&s;ciences to apprehend there
might be great Corruption; yet that They were obliged judicially to deter|mine<MILESTONE N="10">
according to the Te&s;timony of the Witne&s;&s;es, and the Evidence of tho&s;e
Deeds in Law again&s;t which no Proofs were made. That They had con|&s;tantly
heard all that the adver&s;e Party had thought fit to object, both
again&s;t the Credit of any Witne&s;&s;es, and the Truth and Validity of any
Conveyances which were produced; upon which They had rejected many
Witne&s;&s;es, and di&s;allowed &s;ome Conveyances: But when the Objections
were only founded upon Pre&s;umptions and Probabilities, as mo&s;t u&s;ually
they were, they could not weigh down the full and categorical Evidence
that was given.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;THAT if They had yielded to the Importunities of the Per&s;ons concerned,<MILESTONE N="20">
who often pre&s;&s;ed to have farther Time given to them to prove &s;uch a Perjury,
or to di&s;prove &s;uch a Conveyance; it mu&s;t have made their Work endle&s;s,
and &s;topped all Manner of Proceedings, for which it appeared They were
&s;treightened too much in Time: And that indeed would have but opened
the Door wider for Perjuries and other Corruptions; &s;ince it was very plain
to them, that either Side could bring as many Witne&s;&s;es as They plea&s;ed, to
prove what They plea&s;ed, and that They would bring as many as They be|lieved
nece&s;&s;ary to the Work in Hand. And therefore the Commi&s;&s;ioners
having before pre&s;cribed a Method and Rule to them&s;elves for their Pro|ceedings,
and that no Man could have a Cau&s;e, in which He was concerned,<MILESTONE N="30">
brought to Hearing without his knowing when it was to be heard, and &s;o
it was to be pre&s;umed, that He was well provided to &s;upport his own Ti|tle;
They had thought fit, upon mature Deliberation among&s;t them&s;elves,
to adhere to the Order They had pre&s;cribed to them&s;elves and others,
and to conclude, that They would not be able to prove that another Day,
which They were not able to prove at the Time when They ought to have
been ready.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;FOR the Di&s;covery of any Forgery after the Decrees had been pa&s;&s;ed, and
upon which They had given no Reparation,&endq; They confe&s;&s;ed, &startq;that &s;ome
few &s;uch Di&s;coveries had been made to them, by which the Forgery ap|peared<MILESTONE N="40">
very clearly: But as They had no Power by the Act of Parlia|ment
to puni&s;h either Forgery or Perjury, but mu&s;t leave the Examina|tion
and Puni&s;hment thereof to the Law and to the Judges of the Law;
&s;o, that They had only Authority to make Decrees upon &s;uch Grounds
as &s;atisfied their Con&s;ciences, but had not any Authority to rever&s;e tho&s;e
Decrees, after they were once made and publi&s;hed, upon any Evidence
what&s;oever.&endq; They concluded with their humble De&s;ire to the King,
that the mo&s;t &s;trict Examinations might be made of their Corruptions, in
which&endq; They &s;aid &startq;They were &s;ure to be found very innocent, again&s;t
all the Malice that was di&s;covered again&s;t them: That They had proceeded<MILESTONE N="50">
in all Things according to the Integrity of their Hearts, and the be&s;t of
their Under&s;tanding; and if through the Defect of that They had erred
<PB N="127" REF="134">
in any Part of their Determinations and Judgments, They hoped their
Want of Wi&s;dom &s;hould not be imputed to them as a Crime.&endq;</P>
<P>MANY,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Defence not perfectly &s;atisfactory.</NOTE> who had a very good Opinion of the Per&s;ons and Abilities of the
Commi&s;&s;ioners, were not yet &s;atisfied with their Defence; nor did They
believe, that They were &s;o &s;trictly bound to judge upon the Te&s;timony of
&s;u&s;pected Witne&s;&s;es; but that They were therefore tru&s;ted with an arbitrary
Power, becau&s;e it was fore&s;een that Juries were not like to be entire: So
that They were, upon weighing all Circum&s;tances, to declare what in
their Con&s;ciences They believed to be true and ju&s;t. That if They had
<MILESTONE N="10">bound them&s;elves up by too &s;trict and unrea&s;onable Rules, They &s;hould rather
in Time have reformed tho&s;e Rules, than think to &s;upport what was done
ami&s;s, by the Ob&s;ervation of what They had pre&s;cribed to them&s;elves. And
it was believed, that the entire Exclu&s;ion of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> from being Wit|ne&s;&s;es
for the proving of what could not in Nature be otherwi&s;e proved, was
not ju&s;t or rea&s;onable. That their Want of Power to rever&s;e or alter their
own Decrees, upon any emergent Rea&s;ons which could afterwards occur,
was a ju&s;t Ground for their more &s;erious Deliberation in and before They
pa&s;&s;ed any &s;uch Decrees. And their Excu&s;e for not granting longer Time
when it was pre&s;&s;ed for, was founded upon Rea&s;ons which were vi&s;ibly not
<MILESTONE N="20">to be ju&s;tified; it not being po&s;&s;ible for any Man to defend him&s;elf again&s;t
the Claims of the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> without knowing what Deeds or Witne&s;&s;es They
could produce for making good their Sugge&s;tions; and therefore it was as
impo&s;&s;ible for them to have all their Evidence upon the Place. Be&s;ides
that it was very evident, that in the la&s;t ten Days of their Sitting (which
was likewi&s;e thought to be when their Power as to tho&s;e Particulars was de|termined,
and in which They had made more Decrees than in all the Time
before), They had made &s;o many in a Day, contrary to their former Rule and
Method, that Men were plainly &s;urpri&s;ed, and could not produce tho&s;e
Proofs which in a &s;hort Time They might have been &s;upplied with; and
<MILESTONE N="30">the refu&s;ing to allow them that Time, was upon the Matter to determine
their Intere&s;t, and to take away their E&s;tates without being once heard,
and upon the bare Allegations of their Adver&s;aries. And in the&s;e la&s;t De|crees
many In&s;tances were given of that Nature, wherein the Evidence ap|peared
to be very full, if Time had been given to produce it.</P>
<P>THERE was one very notable Ca&s;e decreed by the Commi&s;&s;ioners ex|tremely
complained of,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Decree in Favour of the Marquis of</HI> Antrim <HI>uni|ver&s;ally com|plained of.</HI></NOTE> and cried out again&s;t by all Parties, as well <HI>Iri&s;h</HI>
as <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and for which the Commi&s;&s;ioners them&s;elves made no other
Excu&s;e or Defence, but the Receipt of a Letter from the King, which was
not thought a good Plea for &s;worn Judges, as the Commi&s;&s;ioners were. It
<MILESTONE N="40">was the Ca&s;e of the Marquis of <HI>Antrim.</HI> Which Ca&s;e having been &s;o much
upon the Stage, and &s;o much enlarged upon to the Reproach of the King,
and even to the traducing of the Memory of his ble&s;&s;ed Father; and tho&s;e
Men, who artificially contrived the doing of all that was done ami&s;s, having
done all They could to wound the Reputation of the Chancellor, and to
get it to be believed, &startq;that He had by &s;ome fini&s;ter Information mi&s;led the
&startq;King to oblige the Marquis:&endq; It is a Debt due to Truth, and to the Ho|nour
of Both their Maje&s;ties, to &s;et down a very particular Narration of that
whole Affair; by which it will appear, how far the King was from &s;o
much as wi&s;hing that any Thing &s;hould be done for the Benefit of the Mar|quis,
<MILESTONE N="50">which &s;hould be contrary to the Rules of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>WHILST his Maje&s;ty was in foreign Parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A very parti|cular Relation of the Marquis of</HI> Antrim'<HI>s Ca&s;e.</HI></NOTE> He received frequent Adver|ti&s;ements
from <HI>England</HI> and from <HI>Ireland,</HI> &startq;that the Marquis of <HI>Antrim</HI> be|haved
him&s;elf very undutifully towards him; and that He had made him&s;elf
<PB N="128" REF="135">
very grateful to the Rebels, by calumniating the late King: And that He
had given it under his Hand to <HI>Ireton,</HI> or &s;ome other principal Per&s;on em|ployed
under <HI>Cromwell, that his late Maje&s;ty had &s;ent him into</HI> Ireland <HI>to
join with the Rebels, and that his Maje&s;ty was not offended with the</HI> Iri&s;h
<HI>for entering into that Rebellion:&endq;</HI> Which was a Calumny &s;o fal&s;e and &s;o
odious, and reflected &s;o much upon the Honour of his Maje&s;ty, that the
King was re&s;olved, as &s;oon as God &s;hould put it into his Power, to cau&s;e the
&s;tricte&s;t Examination to be made concerning it; the Report having gained
much Credit with his Maje&s;ty, by the Notoriety that the Marquis had pro|cured
great Recommendations from tho&s;e who governed in <HI>Ireland,</HI> to tho&s;e<MILESTONE N="10">
who governed in <HI>England;</HI> and that upon the Pre&s;umption of that He had
come into <HI>England,</HI> and as far as <HI>St. Albans</HI> towards <HI>London,</HI> from whence
He had been forced &s;uddenly to return into <HI>Ireland</HI> by the Activity of his
many Creditors, who upon the News of his Coming had provided for his
Reception, and would unavoidably have ca&s;t him into Pri&s;on. And no Re|commendation
could have inclined tho&s;e who were in Authority, to do any
Thing extraordinary for the Protection of a Per&s;on, who from the Begin|ning
of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Rebellion lay under &s;o ill a Character with them, and had
&s;o ill a Name throughout the Kingdom.</P>
<P>THE King had been very few Days in <HI>London,</HI> after his Arrival from the<MILESTONE N="20">
Parts beyond the Seas, when He was informed that the Marquis of <HI>Antrim</HI>
was upon his Way from <HI>Ireland</HI> towards the Court: And the Commi&s;&s;ioners
from <HI>Ireland,</HI> who have been mentioned before, were the fir&s;t who gave
his Maje&s;ty that Information, and at the &s;ame Time told him all that his
Maje&s;ty had heard before concerning the Marquis, and of the bold Calumnies
with which He had traduced his Royal Father, with many other Particulars;
&startq;all which&endq; They affirmed &startq;would be proved by unque&s;tionable Evidence,
and by Letters and Certificates under his own Hand.&endq; Upon this full Infor|mation
(of the Truth whereof his Maje&s;ty entertained no Doubt), as &s;oon
as the Marquis came to the Town, He was by the King's &s;pecial Order com|mitted<MILESTONE N="30">
to the <HI>Tower;</HI> nor could any Petition from him, or Intreaty of his
Friends, of which He had &s;ome very powerful, prevail with his Maje&s;ty to
admit him into his Pre&s;ence. But by the fir&s;t Opportunity He was &s;ent
Pri&s;oner to <HI>Dublin,</HI> where He was committed to the <HI>Ca&s;tle;</HI> the King
having given Direction, that He &s;hould be proceeded again&s;t with all
Strictne&s;s according to Law: And to that Purpo&s;e, the Lords Ju&s;tices were
required to give all Orders and Directions nece&s;&s;ary. The Marquis &s;till
profe&s;&s;ed and avowed his Innocence, and u&s;ed all the Means He could to
procure that He might be &s;peedily brought to his Trial; which the King
likewi&s;e expected. But after a Year's Detention in Pri&s;on, and Nothing<MILESTONE N="40">
brought again&s;t him, He was fet at Liberty, and had a Pa&s;s given him from
the Council there to go into <HI>England.</HI> He then applied him&s;elf to his
Maje&s;ty, demanding Nothing of Favour, but &s;aid, &startq;He expected Ju&s;tice;
and that after &s;o many Years being deprived of his E&s;tate, He might at
la&s;t be re&s;tored to it, if Nothing could be objected again&s;t him wherein He
had di&s;&s;erved his Maje&s;ty.&endq;</P>
<P>HE was a Gentleman who had been bred up in the Court of <HI>England,</HI>
and having married the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Buckingham</HI> (though again&s;t the King's
Will) He had been afterwards very well received by Both their Maje&s;ties,
and was frequently in their Pre&s;ence. He had &s;pent a very va&s;t E&s;tate in<MILESTONE N="50">
the Court, without having ever received the lea&s;t Benefit from it. He had
retired into <HI>Ireland,</HI> and lived upon his own E&s;tate in that Country, &s;ome
Years before the Rebellion brake out; in the Beginning whereof He had un|dergone
<PB N="129" REF="136">
&s;ome Su&s;picion, having held &s;ome Corre&s;pondence with the Rebels,
and po&s;&s;ibly made &s;ome Undertakings to them: But He went &s;peedily to
<HI>Dublin,</HI> was well received by the Ju&s;tices there, and from thence tran&s;|ported
him&s;elf with their Licen&s;e to <HI>Oxford,</HI> where the King was; to
whom He gave &s;o good an Account of all that had pa&s;&s;ed, that his Maje&s;ty
made no Doubt of his Affection to his Service, though He had very little
Confidence in his Judgment and Under&s;tanding, which were never re|markable.
Be&s;ides that it was well known, that He had a very unrea&s;on|able
Envy towards the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and would fain have it believed
<MILESTONE N="10">that his Intere&s;t in <HI>Ireland</HI> was &s;o great, that He could reclaim that whole
Nation to his Maje&s;ty's Obedience; but that Vanity and Pre&s;umption never
gained the lea&s;t Credit with his Maje&s;ty: Yet it may rea&s;onably be believed
that He thought &s;o him&s;elf, and that it was the Source from which all the
bitter Waters of his own Misfortune i&s;&s;ued.</P>
<P>UPON the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;econd Entering into <HI>England</HI> with their Army upon the
Obligation of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> and all his Maje&s;ty's Endeavours to prevent it being
di&s;appointed, the Marquis of <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> had propo&s;ed to the King, &startq;to make
a Journey privately into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to get into the <HI>Highlands,</HI> where,
with his Maje&s;ty's Authority, He hoped He &s;hould be able to draw toge|ther
<MILESTONE N="20">&s;uch a Body of Men, as might give his Countrymen Cau&s;e to call
for their own Army out of <HI>England,</HI> to &s;ecure them&s;elves.&endq; And with
this Overture or upon Debate thereof, He wi&s;hed &startq;that the Earl of <HI>An|trim</HI>&endq;
(for He was then no more) &startq;might be likewi&s;e &s;ent into <HI>Ul&s;ter,</HI>
where his Intere&s;t lay, and from whence He would be able to tran&s;port
a Body of Men into the <HI>Highlands,</HI> where He had likewi&s;e the Clan of
<HI>Macdonnels,</HI> who acknowledged him to be their Chief, and would be
con&s;equently at his Devotion; by which Means, the Marquis of <HI>Moun|tro&s;e</HI>
would be enabled the more powerfully to proceed in his Under|taking.&endq;
The Earl of <HI>Antrim</HI> entered upon this Undertaking with great
<MILESTONE N="30">Alacrity, and undertook to the King to perform great Matters in <HI>Scotland;</HI> to
which his own Intere&s;t and Animo&s;ity enough di&s;po&s;ed him, having an old and
a &s;harp Controver&s;y and Conte&s;tation with the Marquis of <HI>Argyle,</HI> who had di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
him of a large Territory there. All Things being adju&s;ted for this
Undertaking, and his Maje&s;ty being well plea&s;ed with the Earl's Alacrity,
He created him at that Time a Marquis, gave him Letters to the Marquis
of <HI>Ormond</HI> his Lieutenant there, as well to &s;atisfy him of the good Opinion
He had of the Marquis of <HI>Antrim,</HI> and of the Tru&s;t He had repo&s;ed in
him, as to wi&s;h him to give him all the A&s;&s;i&s;tance He could with Conve|nience,
for the carrying on the Expedition for <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40">AND for the better preventing of any Inconvenience, that might fall out
by the Ra&s;hne&s;s and Inadvertency of the Marquis of <HI>Antrim</HI> towards the
Lord Lieutenant, his Maje&s;ty &s;ent <HI>Daniel ONeile</HI> of his Bedchamber into
<HI>Ireland</HI> with him, who had great Power over him, and very much Credit
with the Marquis of <HI>Ormond;</HI> and was a Man of that Dexterity and Ad|dre&s;s,
that no Man could &s;o well prevent the Inconveniences and Prejudice,
which the natural Levity and Indi&s;cretion of the other might tempt him to, or
more di&s;po&s;e and incline the Lord Lieutenant to take little Notice of tho&s;e
Vanities and Indi&s;cretions. And the King, who had no De&s;ire that the Marquis
&s;hould &s;tay long in <HI>Dublin,</HI> upon his Promi&s;e that He would u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible
<MILESTONE N="50">Expedition in tran&s;porting him&s;elf into <HI>Scotland,</HI> gave him Leave to hold that
Corre&s;pondence with the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Rebels (who had the Command of all the
Northern Parts, and without who&s;e Connivance at lea&s;t, He could very
hardly be able to make his Levies and tran&s;port his Men) as was nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="130" REF="137">
to his Purpo&s;es: Within the Limits of which, it is probable enough that
He did not contain him&s;elf; for the Education and Conver&s;ation He had
in the World, had not extirpated that natural Craft in which that Nation
excels, and by which They only deceive them&s;elves; and might &s;ay many
Things, which He had not Authority or Warrant to &s;ay.</P>
<P>UPON his Coming to <HI>Dublin,</HI> the Lord Lieutenant gave him all the
Countenance He could wi&s;h, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in all the Ways He could
propo&s;e, to pro&s;ecute his De&s;ign; but the Men were to be rai&s;ed in or near
the Rebels Quarters. And it cannot be denied, but that the Levies He
made, and &s;ent over into <HI>Scotland</HI> under the Command of <HI>Calkito,</HI> were the<MILESTONE N="10">
Foundation of all tho&s;e wonderful Acts, which were performed afterwards by
the Marquis of <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> (They were fifteen hundred Men, very good, and with
very good Officers, all &s;o hardy, that neither the ill Fare nor the ill Lodging
in the <HI>Highlands</HI> gave them any Di&s;couragement), and gave the fir&s;t Op|portunity
to the Marquis of <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> of being in the Head of an Army;
under which He drew together &s;uch of the <HI>Highlanders</HI> and others of his
Friends, who were willing to repair to him. But upon any military Action,
and Defeat given to the Enemy, which happened as often as They en|countered
the <HI>Scots,</HI> the <HI>Highlanders</HI> went always home with their Booty,
and the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> only &s;taid together with their General. And from this Be|ginning<MILESTONE N="20">
the Marquis of <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> grew to that Power, that after many Bat|tles
won by him with notable Slaughter of the Enemy, He marched victo|riou&s;ly
with his Army till He made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and re|deemed
out of the Pri&s;on there the Earl of <HI>Crawford,</HI> Lord <HI>Ogilby,</HI> and many
other noble Per&s;ons, who had been taken and &s;ent thither, with Re&s;olution
that They &s;hould all lo&s;e their Heads. And the Marquis of <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> did
always acknowledge, that the Ri&s;e and Beginning of his good Succe&s;s was
due and to be imputed to that Body of <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> which had in the Beginning
been &s;ent over by the Marquis of <HI>Antrim;</HI> to whom the King had ac|knowledged
the Service by &s;everal Letters, all of his own Handwriting;<MILESTONE N="30">
in which were very gracious Expre&s;&s;ions of the Sen&s;e his Maje&s;ty had of his
great Services, and his Re&s;olution to reward him.</P>
<P>IT is true, that the Marquis of <HI>Antrim</HI> had not gone over him&s;elf with
his Men, as He had promi&s;ed to do, but &s;tayed in <HI>Ul&s;ter</HI> under Pretence of
rai&s;ing a greater Body of Men, with which He would adventure his own
Per&s;on; but either out of Jealou&s;y or Di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t the Marquis of
<HI>Mountro&s;e,</HI> or having in Truth no Mind to that Service of <HI>Scotland,</HI> He
pro&s;ecuted not that Purpo&s;e, but remained &s;till in <HI>Ul&s;ter,</HI> where all his own
E&s;tate lay, and &s;o was in the Rebels Quarters, and no Doubt was often in
their Councils; by which He gave great Advantages again&s;t him&s;elf, and<MILESTONE N="40">
might in Strictne&s;s of Law have been as &s;everely puni&s;hed by the King, as
the wor&s;t of the Rebels. At la&s;t, in his moving from Place to Place (for
He was not in any Expedition with the Rebels) He was taken Pri&s;oner by
the <HI>Scots,</HI> who intended to have put him to Death for having &s;ent Men into
<HI>Scotland;</HI> but He made his E&s;cape out of their Hands, and tran&s;ported
him&s;elf into <HI>Flanders,</HI> and from thence, having A&s;&s;urance that the Prince
(his Maje&s;ty that now is) was then in the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> He came with two good
Frigats into the Port of <HI>Falmouth,</HI> and offered his Service to his Royal High|ne&s;s;
and having in his Frigats a Quantity of Arms and &s;ome Ammunition,
which He had procured in <HI>Flanders</HI> for the Service of <HI>Ireland,</HI> mo&s;t of the<MILESTONE N="50">
Arms and Ammunition were employed, with his Con&s;ent, for the Supply of
the Troops and Garri&s;ons in <HI>Cornwall:</HI> And the Prince made U&s;e of one of
the Frigats to tran&s;port his Per&s;on to <HI>Scilly,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Jer&s;ey;</HI>
<PB N="131" REF="138">
without which Convenience, his Highne&s;s had been expo&s;ed to great Diffi|culties,
and could hardly have e&s;caped the Hands of his Enemies. After
all which, when <HI>Dublin</HI> was given up to the Parliament, and the King's
Authority was withdrawn out of that Kingdom, He again (not having
wherewithal to live any where el&s;e) tran&s;ported him&s;elf into <HI>Ireland,</HI> made
him&s;elf gracious with the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> and was by them &s;ent into <HI>France,</HI> to de|&s;ire
the Queen Mother and the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> &startq;to &s;end the Marquis of
<HI>Ormond</HI> to rea&s;&s;ume his Maje&s;ty's Government in that Kingdom;&endq; which was
done accordingly, in the Manner that is mentioned el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10">THE Marquis of <HI>Antrim</HI> alleged all the&s;e Particulars, and produced
many original Letters from the late King (be&s;ides tho&s;e which are mentioned),
the Queen Mother, and the Prince, in all which his Services had been ac|knowledged,
and many Promi&s;es made to him; and concluded with a full
Prote&s;tation, &startq;that He de&s;ired no Pardon for any Thing that He had ever done
again&s;t the King; and if there were the lea&s;t Proof that He had failed in
his Fidelity to him, or had not according to the be&s;t of his Under&s;tanding
advanced his Service, He looked for no Favour. But if his being in the
<HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Quarters and con&s;ulting with them, without which He could not
have made his Levies for <HI>Scotland,</HI> nor tran&s;ported them if He had levied
<MILESTONE N="20">them, and if his living among&s;t them afterwards, when his Maje&s;ty's Au|thority
was drawn from thence, and when He could live no where el&s;e,
do by the &s;trict Letter of the Law expo&s;e him to Ruin without his Ma|je&s;ty's
Grace and Favour, He did hope his Maje&s;ty would redeem him from
that Mi&s;ery, and that the Forfeiture of his E&s;tate &s;hould not be taken, as
if He were a Traitor and a Rebel to the King.&endq; And it appeared that
if He were re&s;tored to all He could pretend to, or of which He had ever
been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, his Debts were &s;o great, and his Creditors had tho&s;e legal In|cumbrances
upon his E&s;tate, that his Condition at be&s;t would not be liable
to much Envy.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30">THOUGH the King had been never taken Notice of to have any great
Inclinations to the Marquis, who was very little known to him; yet this
Repre&s;entation and clear View of what He had done and what He had
&s;uffered, rai&s;ed great Compa&s;&s;ion towards him in the Royal Brea&s;t of his
Maje&s;ty. And He thought it would in &s;ome Degree reflect upon his own
Honour and Ju&s;tice, and upon the Memory of his ble&s;&s;ed Father, if in
a Time when He pa&s;&s;ed by &s;o many Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions very heinous, He
&s;hould leave the Marquis expo&s;ed to the Fury of his Enemies (who were
only his Enemies becau&s;e They were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his E&s;tate, and becau&s;e
He de&s;ired to have his own from them) for no other Crime upon the Mat|ter,
<MILESTONE N="40">than for not having that Prudence and that Providence in his Endea|vours
to &s;erve the King, as He ought to have had; that is, He ought to
have been wi&s;er. And the Rigour exerci&s;ed towards him upon his fir&s;t Ar|rival,
in &s;ending him to the <HI>Tower</HI> and afterwards into <HI>Ireland,</HI> by tho&s;e who
enough wi&s;hed his De&s;truction, and that They had not been able to make
the lea&s;t Proof again&s;t him, improved his Maje&s;ty's good Di&s;po&s;ition towards
him. Yet He refu&s;ed po&s;itively to write a Letter to the Commi&s;&s;ioners on
his Behalf; which the Marquis mo&s;t importunately de&s;ired, as the only
Thing that could do him Good. But his Maje&s;ty directed a Letter to be
prepared to the Lord Lieutenant, in which all his Allegations and Sugge&s;tions
<MILESTONE N="50">&s;hould be &s;et down, and the Truth thereof examined by him; and that if
He &s;hould be found to have committed no greater Faults again&s;t the King,
than tho&s;e which He confe&s;&s;ed, then that Letter &s;hould be &s;ent to the Commi&s;|&s;ioners,
that They might &s;ee Both their Maje&s;ties Te&s;timonies in &s;uch Parti|culars
<PB N="132" REF="139">
as were known to them&s;elves. And this Letter was very warily
drawn, and being approved by his Maje&s;ty, was &s;ent accordingly to the
Lord Lieutenant. And &s;hortly after a Copy of it &s;igned by the King (who
conceived it only to be a Duplicate, le&s;t the other &s;hould mi&s;carry) was,
contrary to his Maje&s;ty's Re&s;olution, and contrary to the Advice of the
Chancellor and without his Knowledge, likewi&s;e &s;ent to the Commi&s;&s;ioners;
who had thereupon made &s;uch a Decree as is before mentioned, and de|clared,
&startq;that They had made it only upon that Ground;&endq; which gave his
Maje&s;ty &s;ome Trouble, and obliged him to in&s;ert a Clau&s;e in the next Bill
concerning that Affair.<MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>AND this was the whole Proceeding that related to the Marquis of <HI>An|trim:</HI>
And it is yet very hard to comprehend, wherein there was more Favour
&s;hewed towards him by his Maje&s;ty, than He might in Truth very rea&s;onably
pretend to, what Noi&s;e &s;oever was rai&s;ed, and what Glo&s;&s;es &s;oever made;
which proceeded only from the general Di&s;like of the Man, who had much
more Weakne&s;s than Wickedne&s;s in him, and was an Object rather of Pity
than of Malice or Envy.</P>
<P>WHEN his Maje&s;ty entered upon the Debate of the third Bill, which was
tran&s;mitted to him for a Supplement and Addition to the other two, He
quickly found the Settlement propo&s;ed, and which was the End of the three<MILESTONE N="20">
Bills,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Difficul|ties of a Set|tlement in|crea&s;ed.</NOTE> was now grown more difficult than ever. All the Mea&s;ures, which
had formerly been taken from the great Proportion of Land which would
remain to be di&s;po&s;ed of, were no more to be relied upon, but appeared to
have been a wrong Foundation from the Beginning; which was now made
more de&s;perate, by the va&s;t Proportions which had been a&s;&s;igned to the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI>
by the Commi&s;&s;ioners Decrees: And &s;omewhat had intervened by &s;ome
Acts of Bounty from his Maje&s;ty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">By &s;ome im|provident Acts of Bounty in the King.</NOTE> which had not been carefully enough
watched and repre&s;ented to him.</P>
<P>THE King had, upon pa&s;&s;ing the former Bills, and upon di&s;cerning how
much the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> were like to &s;uffer, re&s;olved to retain, all that &s;hould by<MILESTONE N="30">
Forfeiture or otherwi&s;e come to his Maje&s;ty, in his own Power; to the End,
that when the Settlement &s;hould be made, He might be able to gratify
tho&s;e of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Nation, who had any Thing of Merit towards him, or
had been lea&s;t faulty. And if He had ob&s;erved that Re&s;olution, very much
of the Trouble He underwent afterwards had been prevented: For He would
then, be&s;ides that which <HI>Cromwell</HI> had re&s;erved to him&s;elf (which was a
va&s;t Tract of Ground), have had all tho&s;e Forfeitures which the Regicides
had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, and other criminal Per&s;ons; which amounted to a
huge Quantity of the be&s;t Land. And though the King had before de|&s;igned
all tho&s;e forfeited Lands to his Brother the Duke, yet his Highne&s;s<MILESTONE N="40">
was &s;o plea&s;ed with the Re&s;olution his Maje&s;ty had taken, to retain them to
that Purpo&s;e, that He forbore to pro&s;ecute that Grant, till He heard of
great Quantities of Land every Day granted away by his Maje&s;ty to his
Servants and others; whereby He &s;aw the main End would be di&s;ap|pointed.
And then He re&s;olved to be no longer a Lo&s;er for the Benefit of
tho&s;e, who had no Pretence to what They got; and &s;o proceeded in
getting that Grant from the King to him&s;elf of tho&s;e Lands de&s;igned
to him.</P>
<P>THE King had &s;werved from that Rule, before it was &s;carce di&s;cerned:
And the Error of it may be very ju&s;tly imputed to the Earl of <HI>Orrery,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>$word$ Improvi|dence owing to the Earl of</HI> Orrery.</NOTE> and<MILESTONE N="50">
to none but him; who believing that He could never be well enough at
Court, except He had Courtiers of all Sorts obliged to him, who would
therefore &s;peak well of him in all Places and Companies (and tho&s;e Arts of
<PB N="133" REF="140">
his put the King to much Trouble and Lo&s;s both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI>),
He commended to many of &s;uch Friends (though He had advi&s;ed the
King to the former Re&s;olution) many Suits of that Kind, and &s;ent Certi|ficates
to them, oftentimes under his own Hand, of the Value tho&s;e Suits
might be to them if obtained, and of the little Importance the granting of
them would be to his Maje&s;ty; which, having been &s;hewed to the King,
di&s;po&s;ed him to tho&s;e Conce&s;&s;ions, which otherwi&s;e He would not &s;o ea&s;ily
have made. Then He directed them a Way (being then one of the Lords
Ju&s;tices) for the more immediate pa&s;&s;ing tho&s;e Grants They could obtain,
<MILESTONE N="10">without meeting tho&s;e Ob&s;tructions which They had been &s;ubject to; for
when any of tho&s;e Grants had been brought to the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI>
the Chancellor always &s;topped them, and put his Maje&s;ty in Mind of his
former Re&s;olution: But this new Way (in it&s;elf lawful enough) kept him
from knowing any of tho&s;e Tran&s;actions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This $word$ without the Chancellor's Knowledge.</NOTE> which were made by Letters from
the King to the Lords Ju&s;tices; and thereupon the Grants were prepared
there, and pa&s;&s;ed under the Great Seal of <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>THERE was then likewi&s;e a new Clau&s;e introduced into tho&s;e Grants, of
a very new Nature; for being grounded always upon Letters out of <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
and pa&s;&s;ed under the Seal of <HI>Ireland,</HI> the Letters were prepared and
<MILESTONE N="20">formed there, and tran&s;mitted hither only for his Maje&s;ty's Sign Manual: So
that neither the King's learned Council at Law, nor any other his Mini&s;ters (the
Secretaries only excepted), had any Notice or the Peru&s;al of any of tho&s;e
Grants. The Clau&s;e was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And with an extraordinary Clau&s;e in&s;ert|ed in the Grants.</NOTE> &startq;that if any of tho&s;e Lands &s;o granted by his
Maje&s;ty &s;hould be otherwi&s;e decreed, his Maje&s;ty's Grantee &s;hould be re|pri&s;ed
with other Lands:&endq; So that in many Ca&s;es, the greate&s;t Inducement
to his Maje&s;ty's Bounty being the Incertainty of his own Right, which the
Per&s;on to whom it was granted was obliged to vindicate at his own Charge,
the King was now bound to make it good, if his Grant was not valid. And
&s;o that which was but a contingent Bounty, which commonly was the &s;ole
<MILESTONE N="30">Argument for the pa&s;&s;ing it, was now turned into a real and &s;ub&s;tantial
Benefit, as a Debt; which created another Difficulty in the Settlement:
Which was yet the more hard, becau&s;e there were many Claims of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI>
them&s;elves yet unheard, all the fal&s;e Admea&s;urements to be examined, and
many other Uncertainties to be determined by the Commi&s;&s;ioners; which
left tho&s;e who were in quiet Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as well as tho&s;e who were out of it,
in the highe&s;t In&s;ecurity and Apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>THIS Intricacy and even De&s;pair, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all Kind of People, of
any Settlement, made all of them willing to contribute to any that could
be propo&s;ed. They found his Maje&s;ty very unwilling to con&s;ent to the Re|peal
<MILESTONE N="40">of the Decrees made by the Commi&s;&s;ioners; which mu&s;t have taken
away the Confidence and A&s;&s;urance of what&s;oever was to be done hereafter,
by making Men &s;ee, that what was &s;ettled by one Act of Parliament might
immediately be un&s;ettled by another: So that there was no Hope by that
Expedient to increa&s;e the Number of Acres, which being left might in any
Degree comply with the &s;everal Pretences. The <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> found, that They
might only be able to ob&s;truct any Settlement, but &s;hould never be able to
get &s;uch a one as would turn to their own Satisfaction. The Soldiers and
<HI>Adventurers</HI> agreed le&s;s among&s;t them&s;elves: And the Clamour was as great
again&s;t tho&s;e, who by fal&s;e Admea&s;urements had gotten more than They
<MILESTONE N="50">&s;hould have, as from tho&s;e who had received le&s;s than was their Due; and
They who lea&s;t feared any new Examination could not yet have any &s;ecure
Title, before all the re&s;t were &s;ettled. In a Word, all Men found that any
Settlement would be better th&aacute;n none; and that more Profit would ari&s;e from
<PB N="134" REF="141">
a &s;maller Proportion of Land quietly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and hu&s;banded accordingly,
than from a much greater Proportion under a doubtful Title and an Incertainty,
which mu&s;t di&s;hearten any Indu&s;try and Improvement.</P>
<P>UPON the&s;e Con&s;iderations and Motives, They met among&s;t them&s;elves,
and debated together by what Expedient They might draw Light out of this
Darkne&s;s. There appeared only one Way which admini&s;tered any rea&s;on|able
Hope; which was, by increa&s;ing the Stock for Repri&s;als to &s;uch a De|gree,
that all Mens Pretences might in &s;ome Mea&s;urebe provided for: And
there was no other Way to arrive to this, but by every Man's parting with
&s;omewhat which He thought to be his own. And to this They had one<MILESTONE N="10">
Encouragement, that was of the highe&s;t Prevalence with them, which was,
that this Way an End would be put to the illimited Juri&s;diction of the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners
(which was very terrible to all of them), who from henceforth
could have little other Power, than to execute what &s;hould here be agreed
upon.</P>
<P>IN Conclu&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The different Parties at la&s;t agree upon an Expedient for a Settlement.</NOTE> They brought a Propo&s;ition to the King, rai&s;ed and di|ge&s;ted
between them&s;elves, &startq;that all Per&s;ons, who were to receive any Be|nefit
by this Act, &s;hould abate and give a fourth Part of what They had,
towards the Stock for Repri&s;als; all which the Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould di&s;|tribute
among&s;t tho&s;e <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> who &s;hould appear mo&s;t fit for his Maje&s;ty's<MILESTONE N="20">
Bounty.&endq; And this Agreement was &s;o unanimous, that though it met
with &s;ome ob&s;tinate Oppo&s;ition after it was brought before the King, yet
the Number of the Oppo&s;ers was &s;o &s;mall in Re&s;pect of the others who
agreed to it, that They grew weary and a&s;hamed of farther Contention.
And thereupon that <HI>Third Act of Settlement,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hereupon the King pa&s;&s;es the</HI> Third Act of Settlement.</NOTE> as &s;upplemental to the other
two, was con&s;ented to by the King; who, to publi&s;h to the World that
Nothing &s;tuck with him which &s;eemed to reflect upon the Commi&s;&s;ioners,
re&s;olved to make no Change: And &s;o though two of them, who had Of|fices
here to di&s;charge, prevailed with his Maje&s;ty that They might not return
again into <HI>Ireland;</HI> the other five were continued, to execute what was more<MILESTONE N="30">
to be done by this Act, and &s;o to perfect the Settlement. And no Doubt it
will be here &s;aid, that this Expedient might have been &s;ooner found, and &s;o
prevented many of tho&s;e Di&s;orders and Inconveniences which intervened.
But They who knew that Time, and the Perver&s;ene&s;s and Ob&s;tinacy that
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all Pretenders, mu&s;t confe&s;s that the Sea&s;on was never ripe before:
Nor could their Con&s;ent and Agreement, upon which this Act was founded,
ever be obtained before.</P>
<P>THESE were all the Tran&s;actions which pa&s;&s;ed with Reference to <HI>Ireland,</HI>
whil&s;t the Chancellor remained at that Board; in which He acted no
more than any other of the Lords who were pre&s;ent did: Except when any<MILESTONE N="40">
Difficulties occurred in their private Meetings and Debates, They &s;ometimes
re&s;orted to him for Advice, which He was ready to give; being always
willing to take any Pains, which might make that very difficult Work
more ea&s;y to be brought to a good End. But as He never thought He
de&s;erved any Reward for &s;o doing, &s;o He never expected the Benefit of one
Shilling in Money or in Money's Worth, for any Thing He ever did in that
Affair; and was &s;o far from entertaining any Overture to that Purpo&s;e, that
it is notoriou&s;ly known to many Per&s;ons of Honour, who I pre&s;ume will be
ready to te&s;tify the &s;ame, that when, upon his Maje&s;ty's fir&s;t Return into
<HI>England,</HI> &s;ome Propo&s;itions were made to him of receiving the Grant of<MILESTONE N="50">
&s;ome forfeited Lands, and for the buying other Lands there upon the De|&s;ire
of the Owners thereof, and at &s;o low a Price that the very Profit of the
Land would in a &s;hort Time have paid for the Purcha&s;e, and other Over|tures
<PB N="135" REF="142">
of immediate Benefit in Money (which others did and lawfully might
accept); He rejected all Propo&s;itions of that Kind or relating to it, and de|clared
publickly and privately, &startq;that He would neither have Lands in <HI>Ire|land</HI>
nor the lea&s;t Benefit from thence, till all Differences and Pretences
in that Kingdom &s;hould be &s;o fully &s;ettled and agreed, that there could
be no more Appeal to the King, or repairing to the King's Council for
Ju&s;tice; in which,&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;He &s;hould never be thought &s;o competent
an Advi&s;er, if He had any Title of his own in that Kingdom to bias his
Inclinations.&endq; And He was often heard to &s;ay, &startq;that He never took a
<MILESTONE N="10">firmer Re&s;olution in any Particular in his Life, than to adhere to that
Conclu&s;ion.&endq;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Vindication of the Chan|cellor with Regard to the</HI> Iri&s;h <HI>Affairs.</HI></NOTE> Yet becau&s;e it was notorious afterwards, that He did re|ceive
&s;ome Money out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and had a lawful Title to receive more
(with which He was reproached when He could not an&s;wer for him&s;elf);
it may not be ami&s;s in this Place, for his Vindication, to &s;et down parti|cularly
how that came to pa&s;s, and to mention all the Circum&s;tances which
preceded, accompanied or attended, that Affair.</P>
<P>IN the Bills which were fir&s;t tran&s;mitted from <HI>Ireland</HI> after his Maje&s;ty's
happy Return, there was an Impo&s;ition of a certain Sum of Money upon
&s;ome &s;pecified Lands in &s;everal Provinces, &startq;which was to be paid to his
<MILESTONE N="20">Maje&s;ty within a limited Time, and to be di&s;po&s;ed of by his Maje&s;ty to
&s;uch Per&s;ons who had &s;erved him faithfully, and &s;uffered in &s;o doing,&endq; or
Words to that Effect; for He often prote&s;ted that He never &s;aw the Act of
Parliament, and was mo&s;t confident that He never heard of it at the Time
when it pa&s;&s;ed, He being often ab&s;ent from the Council, by Rea&s;on of the
Gout or other Accidents, when &s;uch Matters were tran&s;acted. But two
Years after the King's Return or thereabout, He received a Letter from the
Earl of <HI>Orrery,</HI> &startq;that there would be in his Hands, and in the Earl of <HI>An|gle&s;ey's</HI>
and the Lord <HI>Ma&s;&s;aren's</HI>&endq; (who it &s;eems were appointed Trea&s;urers
to receive the Money to be rai&s;ed by that Act of Parliament), &startq;a good Sum
<MILESTONE N="30">of Money for him; which He gave him Notice of, to the End that He might
give Direction for the Di&s;po&s;al thereof, whether He would have it returned
into <HI>England,</HI> or laid out in Land in <HI>Ireland;</HI>&endq; and He wi&s;hed &startq;that He
would &s;peedily &s;end his Direction, becau&s;e He was confident that the
Money would be paid in, at lea&s;t by the Time that his Letter could arrive
there.&endq; No Man can be mone &s;urpri&s;ed, than the Chancellor was at the
Receipt of this Letter, believing that there was &s;ome Mi&s;take in it, and
that his Name might have been u&s;ed in Tru&s;t by Somebody who had given him
no Notice of it. And without returning any An&s;wer to the Earl of <HI>Orrery,</HI>
He writ by that Po&s;t to the Lord Lieutenant, to inform him of what the Earl
<MILESTONE N="40">of <HI>Orrery</HI> had writ to him, and de&s;ired him to &startq;inform him by his own En|quiry,
what the Meaning of it was.&endq;</P>
<P>BEFORE He had an An&s;wer from the Lord Lieutenant, or indeed before his
Letter could come to the Lord Lieutenant's Hands, He received a &s;econd
Letter from the Earl of <HI>Orrery;</HI> in which He informed him, &startq;that there was
now paid into his U&s;e, the Sum of twelve thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and odd Pounds,
and that there would be the like Sum again received for him at the End of
&s;ix Months;&endq; and &s;ent him a particular Direction, &startq;to what Per&s;on and
in what Form He was to &s;end his Order for the Payment of the Money.&endq;
The Chancellor &s;till forbore to an&s;wer this Letter, till He had received an
<MILESTONE N="50">An&s;wer to what He had written to the Lord Lieutenant, who then informed
him at large, what Title He had to that Money, and how He came to have
it: &startq;That &s;hortly after the pa&s;&s;ing that Act of Parliament, which had given
his Maje&s;ty the Di&s;po&s;al of the Money before mentioned, the Earl of <HI>Or|rery</HI>
<PB N="136" REF="143">
had come to him, the Lord Lieutenant, and putting him in Mind,
how the Chancellor had rejected all Overtures which had been made to
him of Benefit out of that Kingdom&endq; (which Refu&s;al, and many others
that &s;hew how un&s;olicitous He had always been in the Ways of getting, is
not more known to any Man living than to the Lord Lieutenant), &startq;wi&s;hed
that He would move the King to confer &s;ome Part of that Money upon
the Chancellor; which the Lord Lieutenant very willingly did, and his
Maje&s;ty as cheerfully granted: That a Letter was accordingly prepared,
and his Maje&s;ty's Royal Signature procured by Mr. Secretary <HI>Nicholas,</HI>
who was at the &s;ame Time commanded by the King not to let him<MILESTONE N="10">
know of it; to which Purpo&s;e there was likewi&s;e a Clau&s;e in the Letter,
whereby it was provided that He &s;hould have no Notice of it; which,&endq;
the Lord Lieutenant &s;aid, &startq;was by his Maje&s;ty's Direction or with his Appro|bation,
becau&s;e it was &s;aid, that if He had Notice of it, He would be &s;o
fooli&s;h as to ob&s;truct it him&s;elf. And there was a Clau&s;e likewi&s;e in the
&s;aid Letter, which directed the Payment of the &s;aid Monies to his Heirs,
Executors or A&s;&s;igns, if He &s;hould die before the Receipt thereof.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Chancellor being &s;o fully adverti&s;ed of all this by the Lord Lieute|tenant,
and of which till that Time He had not the lea&s;t Notice or Ima|gination,
He de&s;ired Secretary <HI>Nicholas</HI> to give him a Copy of that Letter<MILESTONE N="20">
(which had been &s;ince pa&s;&s;ed as a Grant to him under the Great Seal of
<HI>Ireland,</HI> according to the Form then u&s;ed); which the Secretary gave him,
with a large Account of many gracious Circum&s;tances in the King's grant|ing
it, and the Obligation laid upon him of Secrecy, and the great Caution
that was u&s;ed that He might have no Notice of it. After He was informed
of all this, He did not think that there was any Thing left for him to do,
but to make his humble Acknowledgment to his Maje&s;ty for his Royal
Bounty, and to take Care for the receiving and tran&s;mitting the Money;
and doubted not but that He might receive it very hone&s;tly. He did there|fore
wait upon his Maje&s;ty with that Duty that became him: And his Ma|je&s;ty<MILESTONE N="30">
was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to enlarge his Bounty with tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions of
Favour, and of the Satisfaction He had vouch&s;afed to take him&s;elf in con|ferring
his Donative, that his Joy was much greater from that Grace, than
in the Greatne&s;s of the Gift.</P>
<P>AT the very &s;ame Time, and the very Day that the Chancellor received
the Letter from the Lord Lieutenant, the Earl of <HI>Portland</HI> came to him,
and informed him of a Difference that was fallen out between the Lord <HI>Love|lace</HI>
and Sir <HI>Bul&s;trode Whitlock,</HI> upon a Defect in the Title to certain Lands
purcha&s;ed heretofore by Sir <HI>Bul&s;trode Whitlock</HI> from the Lord <HI>Lovelace,</HI> and
enjoyed by him ever &s;ince; but being by the Nece&s;&s;ity of that Time, the<MILESTONE N="40">
Delinquency of <HI>Lovelace</HI> and the Power of <HI>Whitlock,</HI> bought and &s;old at an
Undervalue, and the Time being now more equal, <HI>Lovelace</HI> re&s;olved to have
more Money, or not to perform a Covenant He had entered into; the Not|performance
whereof would leave the other's Title very defective. The Earl
de&s;ired to reconcile tho&s;e two, which could not be done without Sale of the
Land: And &s;o He propo&s;ed to the Chancellor the buying this Land, which
lay next to &s;ome Land He had in <HI>Wilt&s;hire.</HI> This Propo&s;ition was made
upon the very Day, as is &s;aid before, that He had received the Letter from the
Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland;</HI> by which it appeared that there was near
as much Money already received for him, as would pay for that Pur|cha&s;e,<MILESTONE N="50">
be&s;ides what was more to be received within &s;ix Months after. The
Land was well known to the Chancellor; &s;o that upon a &s;hort Confer|ence
with the Parties, They all agreed upon the Purcha&s;e: And He was
<PB N="137" REF="144">
ea&s;ily prevailed with to undertake the Payment of the greate&s;t Part of the
Money upon &s;ealing the Writings, not making the lea&s;t Doubt, but that
He &s;hould by that Time receive the Money from <HI>Ireland;</HI> which was the
&s;ole Ground and Motive to his making that Purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT the next Letters He received from <HI>Ireland</HI> informed him, &startq;that
the Nece&s;&s;ities of that Kingdom had been &s;uch, that They could only
return &s;ix thou&s;and Pounds of that Money; and that They had been com|pelled
to make U&s;e of the re&s;t for the Publick, which would take Care
to repay it to him in a &s;hort Time:&endq; And &s;o He found him&s;elf engaged in
<MILESTONE N="10">a Purcha&s;e which He could not retract, upon Pre&s;umption of Money which
He could not receive. And He did not only never after receive one Penny of
what was due upon the &s;econd Payment (which He &s;o little &s;u&s;pected could
fail, there being an Act of Parliament for the Security, that He a&s;&s;igned it
upon the Marriage of his &s;econd Son to him, as the be&s;t Part of his Por|tion);
but the Remainder of the fir&s;t Sum, which was &s;o borrowed or taken
from him, or any Part of it, was never after paid to him or to his U&s;e: By
which, and the Inconveniences and Damages which en&s;ued to him from
thence, He might rea&s;onably &s;ay that He was a Lo&s;er, and involved in a
great Debt, by that &s;ignal Bounty of his Maje&s;ty; and which was afterwards
<MILESTONE N="20">made Matter of Reproach to him, and as an Argument of his Corruption.
But this is a very true Account of that Bu&s;ine&s;s, and of all the Money that
He ever received from <HI>Ireland,</HI> with all the Circum&s;tances thereof; which,
in the Judgment of all impartial Men, cannot reflect to the Prejudice of his
Integrity and Honour.</P>
<P>AND &s;o We &s;hall no further pur&s;ue or again re&s;ume any Mention of the
Affairs of <HI>Ireland,</HI> though they will afford a large Field of Matter;
but &s;hall return to the Beginning of the Parliament, from whence We
departed.</P>
<P>IT cannot be expre&s;&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tran&s;actions in Parliament.</NOTE> hardly imagined, with what Alacrity the Parlia|ment
<MILESTONE N="30">entered upon all particular Affairs which might refer to the King's
Honour, Safety or Profit. They pulled up all tho&s;e Principles of Sedition
and Rebellion by the Roots, which in their own Ob&s;ervation had been the
Ground of or contributed to the odious and infamous Rebellion in the long
Parliament.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Prerogative a&s;&s;erted.</NOTE> They declared &startq;that &s;otti&s;h Di&s;tinction between the King's
Per&s;on and his Office to be Trea&s;on; that his Negative Voice could not be
taken from him, and was &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the making a Law, that no
Order or Ordinance of either Hou&s;e could be binding to the Subject without
it; that the Militia was in&s;eparably ve&s;ted in his Maje&s;ty, and that it was
High Trea&s;on to rai&s;e or levy Soldiers without the King's Commi&s;&s;ion.&endq;
<MILESTONE N="40">And becau&s;e the Licence of &s;peaking &s;editiou&s;ly, and of laying &s;candalous
Imputations and A&s;per&s;ions upon the Per&s;on of the King, as &s;aying <HI>that He
was a Papi&s;t,</HI> and &s;uch like Terms, to alienate the Affections of the People
from his Maje&s;ty, had been the Prologue and principal Ingredient to that
Rebellion, and corrupted the Hearts of his loving Subjects; They declared,
&startq;that the rai&s;ing any Calumnies of that Kind upon the King, as &s;aying
<HI>that He is a Papi&s;t, or popi&s;hly affected,</HI> or the like, &s;hould be Felony.&endq;
In a Word, They vindicated all his Regalities and Royal Prerogatives, and
provided for the Safety of his Per&s;on in as loving and ample a Manner as
He could wi&s;h: And towards rai&s;ing and &s;ettling a Revenue proportionable
<MILESTONE N="50">to his Dignity and nece&s;&s;ary Expen&s;e, over and above the Confirmation of
all that had been done or granted in the la&s;t Convention, They entered
upon all the Expedients which could occur to them, and were willing to
receive Propo&s;itions or Advice from any Body that might contribute there|unto.
<PB N="138" REF="145">
In all the&s;e publick Matters, no Man could wi&s;h a more active Spi|rit
to be in them, than They were in Truth po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with.</P>
<P>BUT in that which the King had principally recommended to them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia|ment unwil|ling to con|firm the</HI> Act of Indemnity.</NOTE> the
Confirmation of the <HI>Act of Oblivion and Indemnity,</HI> They proceeded very
&s;lowly, coldly and unwillingly, notwith&s;tanding the King's frequent Me&s;|&s;ages
to them &startq;to di&s;patch it, though with the Delay of tho&s;e other Things
which They thought did more immediately concern him.&endq; They had
many Agents and Solicitors in the Court, who thought that all that was
relea&s;ed by that Act might lawfully be di&s;tributed among&s;t them; and &s;ince
the King had referred that whole Affair to the Parliament, He might well<MILESTONE N="10">
leave it to their Judgments, without his own Interpo&s;ition. But his Maje&s;ty
looked upon him&s;elf as under another Obligation both of Honour and Con|&s;cience,
and upon the Thing it&s;elf as more for the publick Peace and Secu|rity,
than any Thing the Parliament could provide in&s;tead thereof; and
therefore was very much troubled and offended at the apparent Unwilling|ne&s;s
to pa&s;s it. And thereupon He went him&s;elf to the Hou&s;e of Peers,
and &s;ent for the Commons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King &s;trenuou&s;ly urges them to confirm it.</NOTE> and told them, &startq;that it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary
to di&s;patch that Bill, which He him&s;elf had &s;ent to them near two
Months before:&endq; For it was now the eighth of <HI>July.</HI> His Maje&s;ty told
them, &startq;that it was to put him&s;elf in Mind as well as them, that He &s;o often,<MILESTONE N="20">
as often as He came to them, mentioned to them his Declaration from
<HI>Breda.</HI>&endq; And He &s;aid, &startq;He &s;hould put them in Mind of another De|claration
publi&s;hed by them&s;elves about that Time, and which He was
per&s;uaded made his the more effectual, an hone&s;t, generous and Chri&s;tian
Declaration, &s;igned by the mo&s;t eminent Per&s;ons, who had been the mo&s;t
eminent Sufferers; in which They renounced all former Animo&s;ities, all
Memory of former Unkindne&s;&s;es, vowed all imaginable Good-Will and all
Confidence in each other.&endq; All which being pre&s;&s;ed with &s;o much In|&s;tance
by his Maje&s;ty prevailed with them: And They then forthwith di&s;|patched
that Bill;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whereupon They confirm it.</NOTE> and the King as &s;oon confirmed it, and would not &s;tay<MILESTONE N="30">
a few Days, till other important Bills &s;hould be likewi&s;e ready to be pre&s;ented
to him.</P>
<P>AND there cannot be a greater In&s;tance of their De&s;ire to plea&s;e his Ma|je&s;ty
from thenceforth, than that before that Se&s;&s;ion was concluded, not|with&s;tanding
the Prejudice the Clergy had brought upon them&s;elves (as I
&s;aid before) upon their too much good Hu&s;bandry in granting Lea&s;es, and
though the Pre&s;byterian Party was not without an Intere&s;t in Both Hou&s;es
of Parliament; They pa&s;&s;ed a Bill for the Repeal of that Act of Parliament,
by which the Bi&s;hops were excluded from &s;itting there. It was fir&s;t pro|po&s;ed
in the Hou&s;e of Commons by a Gentleman, who had been always<MILESTONE N="40">
taken to be of a Pre&s;byterian Family: And in that Hou&s;e it found le&s;s Op|po&s;ition
than was looked for;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Commons pa&s;s a Bill for re&s;toring Bi|&s;hops to their Seats in Par|liament.</NOTE> all Men knowing, that be&s;ides the Ju&s;tice
of it, and the Prudence to wipe out the Memory of &s;o infamous an Act, as
the Exclu&s;ion of them with all the Circum&s;tances was known to be, it would
be grateful to the King.</P>
<P>BUT when it came into the Hou&s;e of Peers, where all Men expected it
would find a general Concurrence, it met with &s;ome Ob&s;truction; which
made a Di&s;covery of an Intrigue, that had not been &s;u&s;pected. For though
there were many Lords pre&s;ent, who had indu&s;triou&s;ly laboured the pa&s;&s;ing
the former Bill for the Exclu&s;ion, yet They had likewi&s;e been guilty of<MILESTONE N="50">
&s;o many other ill Things, of which They were a&s;hamed, that it was be|lieved
that They would not willingly revive the Memory of the Whole,
by per&s;erving in &s;uch an odious Particular. Nor in Truth did They. But
<PB N="139" REF="146">
when They &s;aw that it would unavoidably pa&s;s (for the Number of that
Party was not con&s;iderable), They either gave their Con&s;ents, as many of
them did, or gave their Negative without Noi&s;e. The Ob&s;truction came
not from thence. The <HI>Catholicks</HI> le&s;s owned the Contradiction, nor were
guilty of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Which is ob|&s;tructed in the Hou&s;e of Lords by the Earl of</HI> Bri&s;tol.</NOTE> though They &s;uffered in it. But the Truth is, it proceeded
from the mercurial Brain of the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> who much affected to be
looked upon as the Head of the <HI>Catholicks;</HI> which They did &s;o little de&s;ire
that He &s;hould be thought, that They very rarely concurred with him.
He well knew that the King de&s;ired (which his Maje&s;ty never di&s;&s;embled)
<MILESTONE N="10">to give the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> Ea&s;e from all the &s;anguinary Laws; and that
He did not de&s;ire that They &s;hould be liable to the other Penalties which
the Law had made them &s;ubject to, whil&s;t They &s;hould in all other Re&s;pects
behave them&s;elves like good Subjects. Nor had They &s;ince his Maje&s;ty's
Return &s;u&s;tained the lea&s;t Prejudice by their Religion, but enjoyed as much
Liberty at Court and in the Country, as any other Men; and with which
the wi&s;e&s;t of them were abundantly &s;atisfied, and did abhor the Activity of
tho&s;e of their own Party, whom They did believe more like to deprive them
of the Liberty They enjoyed, than to enlarge it to them.</P>
<P>WHEN the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> &s;aw this Bill brought into the Hou&s;e for re|&s;toring
<MILESTONE N="20">the Bi&s;hops to their Seats, He went to the King, and informed his Ma|je&s;ty,
&startq;that if this Bill &s;hould &s;peedily pa&s;s, it would ab&s;olutely deprive the
<HI>Catholicks</HI> of all tho&s;e Graces and Indulgence which He intended to them;
for that the Bi&s;hops, when They &s;hould &s;it in the Hou&s;e, whatever their
own Opinions or Inclinations were, would find them&s;elves obliged, that
They might pre&s;erve their Reputation with the People, to contradict and
oppo&s;e what&s;oever &s;hould look like Favour or Connivance towards the
<HI>Catholicks:</HI> And therefore, if his Maje&s;ty continued his former gracious In|clination
towards the <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> He mu&s;t put &s;ome Stop (even for
the Bi&s;hops own Sakes) to the pa&s;&s;ing that Bill, till the other &s;hould be
<MILESTONE N="30">more advanced, which He &s;uppo&s;ed might &s;hortly be done;&endq; there having
been already &s;ome Overtures made to that Purpo&s;e, and a Committee ap|pointed
in the Hou&s;e of Lords to take a View of all the &s;anguinary Laws
in Matters of Religion, and to pre&s;ent them to the Hou&s;e that it might
con&s;ider farther of them. The King &s;urpri&s;ed with the Di&s;cour&s;e from a Man
who had often told him the Nece&s;&s;ity of the re&s;toring the Bi&s;hops, and that
it could not be a perfect Parliament without their Pre&s;ence, thought his
Rea&s;on for the Delay to have Weight in it, and that the Delay for a few
Days could be attended with no Prejudice to the Matter it&s;elf; and there|upon
was willing the Bill &s;hould not be called for, and that when it
<MILESTONE N="40">&s;hould be under Commitment, it &s;hould be detained there for &s;ome Time;
and that He might, the better to produce this Delay, tell &s;ome of his
Friends, &startq;that the King would be well plea&s;ed, that there &s;hould not be
overmuch Ha&s;te in the pre&s;enting that Bill for his Royal A&s;&s;ent.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS grew quickly to be taken Notice of in the Hou&s;e, that after the
fir&s;t Reading of that Bill, it had been put off for a &s;econd Reading longer
than was u&s;ual, when the Hou&s;e was at &s;o much Lei&s;ure; and that now it
was under Commitment, it was ob&s;tructed there, notwith&s;tanding all the En|deavours
&s;ome Lords of the Committee could u&s;e for the Di&s;patch; the Bill
containing very few Words, being only for the Repeal of a former Act,
<MILESTONE N="50">and the Expre&s;&s;ions admitting, that is, giving little Cau&s;e for any Debate.
The Chancellor de&s;ired to know how this came to pa&s;s, and was informed
by one of the Lords of the Committee, &startq;that They were a&s;&s;ured that the
King would have a Stop put to it, till another Bill &s;hould be provided
<PB N="140" REF="147">
which his Maje&s;ty looked for.&endq; Hereupon the Chancellor &s;pake with his
Maje&s;ty, who told him all the Conference which the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> had held
with him, and what He had con&s;ented &s;hould be done. To which the
other replied, &startq;that He was &s;orry that his Maje&s;ty had been prevailed with
to give any Ob&s;truction to a Bill, which every Body knew his Maje&s;ty's
Heart was &s;o much &s;et upon for Di&s;patch; and that if the Rea&s;on were
known, it would quickly put an End to all the Pretences of the <HI>Catho|licks;</HI>
to which his Maje&s;ty knew He was no Enemy.&endq; The King pre|&s;ently
concluded that the Rea&s;on was not &s;ufficient, and wi&s;hed &startq;that the
Bill might be di&s;patched as &s;oon as was po&s;&s;ible, that He might pa&s;s it<MILESTONE N="10">
that Se&s;&s;ion;&endq; which He had appointed to make an End of within few
Days: And &s;o the next Day the Report was called for and made, and the
Bill ordered to be engro&s;&s;ed again&s;t the next Morning; the Earl not being
at that Time in the Hou&s;e. But the next Morning, when the Chancellor
had the Bill engro&s;&s;ed in his Hand to pre&s;ent to the Hou&s;e to be read the
third Time, the Earl came to him to the Wool&s;ack, and with great Di&s;|plea&s;ure
and Wrath in his Countenance told him, &startq;that if that Bill were
read that Day, He would &s;peak again&s;t it;&endq; to which the Chancellor
gave him an An&s;wer that did not plea&s;e him:<NOTE PLACE="marg">But is at la&s;t pa&s;&s;ed.</NOTE> And the Bill was pa&s;&s;ed that
Day. And from that Time the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> was a more avowed and de|clared<MILESTONE N="20">
Enemy to him, than He had before profe&s;&s;ed to be; though the
Friend&s;hip that had been between them had been di&s;continued or broken,
from the Time the Earl had changed his Religion.</P>
<P>THE King within few Days came to the Parliament, to give his Royal A&s;|&s;ent
to tho&s;e Bills which were prepared for him; and then told them, &startq;that
He did thank them with all his Heart, indeed as much as He could for
any Thing, for the Repeal of that Act which excluded the Bi&s;hops from
&s;itting in Parliament.&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;it was an unhappy Act in an unhappy
Time, pa&s;&s;ed with many unhappy Circum&s;tances, and attended with mi|&s;erable
Events; and therefore He did again thank them for repealing it:<MILESTONE N="30">
And that They had thereby re&s;tored Parliaments to their primitive In&s;ti|tutions.&endq;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment adjourn|ed.</NOTE>
This was upon the thirtieth of <HI>July</HI> 1661, when the Parlia|ment
was adjourned to the twentieth of <HI>November</HI> following.</P>
<P>BECAUSE We have mentioned the gracious Purpo&s;es the King had to his
Roman Catholick Subjects, of which afterwards much U&s;e was made to his
Di&s;&s;ervice, to which the Vanity and Pre&s;umption of many of that Profe&s;&s;ion
contributed very much; it may not be un&s;ea&s;onable in this Place to mention
the Ground of that his Maje&s;ty's Goodne&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The true Ground of the King's Favour to the</HI> Roman Catholicks.</NOTE> and the Rea&s;ons why that Pur|po&s;e
of his was not pro&s;ecuted to the Purpo&s;e it was intended, after &s;o fair
a Ri&s;e towards it, by the Appointment of that Committee in the Hou&s;e of<MILESTONE N="40">
Peers, which is remembered above.</P>
<P>IT is not to be wondered at, that the King, at the Age He was of when
the Troubles began in <HI>England,</HI> and when He came out of <HI>England,</HI>
knew very little of the Laws which had been long &s;ince made and were
&s;till in Force again&s;t <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> and le&s;s of the Grounds and Mo|tives
which had introduced tho&s;e Laws. And from the Time that He was
fir&s;t beyond the Seas, He could not be without hearing very much &s;poken
again&s;t the Prote&s;tant Religion, and more for extolling and magnify|ing
the Religion of the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> neither of which Di&s;cour&s;es
made any Impre&s;&s;ion upon him. After the Defeat at <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> and his<MILESTONE N="50">
E&s;cape from thence into <HI>France,</HI> the Queen his Mother (who had very
punctually complied with the King her Hu&s;band's Injunctions, in not &s;uf|fering
any Body to endeavour to pervert the Prince her Son in his Religion,

<HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> than She had been accu&s;tomed to. The Liberty that his Ma|je&s;ty
formerly had in the <HI>Louvre,</HI> to have a Place &s;et a&s;ide for the Exerci&s;e
of his Religion, was taken away: And continual Di&s;cour&s;es were made by
the Queen in his Pre&s;ence, &startq;that He had now no Hope ever to be re&s;tored
to his Dominions, but by the Help of the <HI>Catholicks;</HI> and therefore that
He mu&s;t apply him&s;elf to them in &s;uch a Way, as might induce them to
help him.&endq;</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10">ABOUT this Time there was a &s;hort Collection and Abridgment made of
all the penal Laws, which had been made and which were &s;till in Force in <HI>Eng|land</HI>
again&s;t the <HI>Roman Catholicks;</HI> &startq;that all Prie&s;ts for &s;aying Ma&s;s were to
be put to Death;&endq; the great Penalties which They were to undergo, who
entertained or harboured a Prie&s;t in their Hou&s;e, or were pre&s;ent at Ma&s;s,
and the like; with all other envious Clau&s;es, which were in any Acts of
Parliament, that had been enacted upon &s;everal Trea&s;ons and Con&s;piracies
of the <HI>Roman Catholicks;</HI> in the Reigns of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and King
<HI>James.</HI> And this Collection They cau&s;ed to be tran&s;lated into <HI>French</HI>
and into <HI>Latin,</HI> and &s;cattered it abroad in all Places; after They had cau&s;ed
<MILESTONE N="20">Copies of it to be pre&s;ented to the Queen Mother of <HI>France,</HI> and to the
Cardinal: So that the King came into no Place where tho&s;e Papers were
not &s;hewed to him, and where He was not &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;ked, &startq;whether it
was a true Collection of the Laws of <HI>England,</HI>&endq; and &startq;whether it was
po&s;&s;ible, that any Chri&s;tian Kingdom could exerci&s;e &s;o much Tyranny
again&s;t the Catholick Religion.&endq; The King, who had never heard of the&s;e
Particulars, did really believe that the Paper was forged, and an&s;wered, &startq;He
did not believe that there were &s;uch Laws:&endq; And when He came to his
Lodgings, He gave the Chancellor the Paper, and bade him read it, and
tell him &startq;whether &s;uch Laws were in Force in <HI>England.</HI>&endq; He had heard
<MILESTONE N="30">before of the &s;cattering of tho&s;e Papers, and knew well who had made the
Collection; who had been a Lawyer, and was a <HI>Prote&s;tant,</HI> but had too
good an Opinion of the <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> and de&s;ired too much to be
grateful to them.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor found an Opportunity the next Day to enlarge upon
the Paper to his Maje&s;ty, and informed him of &startq;the Sea&s;ons in which, and
the Occa&s;ions and Provocations upon which, tho&s;e Laws had been made;
of the frequent Trea&s;ons and Con&s;piracies which had been entered into by
&s;ome <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> always with the Privity and Approbation of their
Prie&s;ts and Confe&s;&s;ors, again&s;t the Per&s;on and Life of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI>
<MILESTONE N="40">and after her Death, of the infamous and dete&s;table Gunpowder Trea&s;on
to have de&s;troyed King <HI>James</HI> and his Po&s;terity, with the whole Nobility
of the Kingdom: So that in tho&s;e Times, the Pope having excommuni|cated
the whole Kingdom, and ab&s;olved the Subjects from all their Oaths
of Fidelity, there &s;eemed no Expedient to pre&s;erve the Crown, but the
u&s;ing the&s;e Severities again&s;t tho&s;e who were profe&s;&s;ed Enemies to it.
But that &s;ince tho&s;e Times, that the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> had lived quietly,
that Rigour had not been u&s;ed: And that the King his Father's Clemency
towards tho&s;e of that Profe&s;&s;ion (which Clemency extended no farther
than the di&s;pen&s;ing with the utmo&s;t Rigour of the Laws), was the
<MILESTONE N="50">Ground of the Scandal of his being popi&s;hly affected, that contributed
as much to his Ruin, as any particular Malice in the wor&s;t of his
Enemies.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="149">
THE King hearkened attentively to all that was &s;aid, and then an&s;wered,
&startq;that He could not doubt but there was &s;ome very extraordinary Rea&s;on
for the making &s;uch &s;trange Laws: But whatever the Rea&s;on then was,
that it was at pre&s;ent and for many Years pa&s;t very evident, that there
was no &s;uch Malignity in the <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> that &s;hould continue that
heavy Yoke upon their Necks. That He knew well enough, that if He
were in <HI>England,</HI> He had not in him&s;elf the Power to repeal any Act of
Parliament, without the Con&s;ent of Parliament: But that He knew no
Rea&s;on why He might not profe&s;s, that He did not like tho&s;e Laws which
cau&s;ed Men to be put to Death for their Religion; and that He would<MILESTONE N="10">
do his be&s;t, if ever God re&s;tored him to his Kingdom, that tho&s;e bloody
Laws might be repealed. And that if there were no other Rea&s;on of State
than He could yet comprehend, again&s;t the taking away the other Penal|ties,
He &s;hould be glad that all tho&s;e Di&s;tinctions between his Subjects
might be removed; and that whil&s;t They were all equally good Subjects,
They might equally enjoy his Protection.&endq; And his Maje&s;ty did fre|quently,
when He was in the Courts of Catholick Princes, and when He
was &s;ure to hear the Sharpne&s;s of the Laws in <HI>England</HI> inveighed again&s;t,
enlarge upon the &s;ame Di&s;cour&s;e: And it had been a very un&s;ea&s;onable
Pre&s;umption in any Man, who would have endeavoured to have di&s;&s;uaded<MILESTONE N="20">
him from entertaining that Candour in his Heart.</P>
<P>WITH this gracious Di&s;po&s;ition his Maje&s;ty returned into <HI>England;</HI> and
received his Catholick Subjects with the &s;ame Grace and Frankne&s;s, that
He did his other: And They took all Opportunities to extol their own
Sufferings, which They would have under&s;tood to have been for him. And
&s;ome very noble Per&s;ons there were, who had &s;erved his Father very wor|thily
in the War, and &s;uffered as largely afterwards for having done &s;o:
But the Number of tho&s;e was not great, but much greater than of tho&s;e
who &s;hewed any Affection to him or for him, during the Time of his Ab|&s;ence,
and the Government of the U&s;urper. Yet &s;ome few there were, even<MILESTONE N="30">
of tho&s;e who had &s;uffered mo&s;t for his Father, who did &s;end him Supply
when He was abroad, though They were hardly able to provide Nece&s;&s;aries
for them&s;elves: And in his E&s;cape from <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> He received extraordi|nary
Benefit, by the Fidelity of many poor People of that Religion; which
his Maje&s;ty was never re&s;erved in the Remembrance of. And this gracious
Di&s;po&s;ition in him did not then appear ingrateful to any. And then, upon
an Addre&s;s made to the Hou&s;e of Peers in the Name of the <HI>Roman Catho|licks,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Committee of the Lords for rel$xing the penal Laws again&s;t the</HI> Roman Ca|tholicks.</NOTE>
for &s;ome Relaxation of tho&s;e Laws which were &s;till in Force again&s;t
them, the Hou&s;e of Peers appointed that Committee which is mentioned
before, to examine and report all tho&s;e penal Statutes, which reached to the<MILESTONE N="40">
taking away the Life of any <HI>Roman Catholick,</HI> Prie&s;t or Layman, for his
Religion; there not appearing one Lord in the Hou&s;e, who &s;eemed to be
unwilling that tho&s;e Laws &s;hould be repealed. And after that Committee
was appointed, the Roman Catholick Lords and their Friends for &s;ome
Days diligently attended it, and made their Ob&s;ervations upon &s;everal Acts
of Parliament, in which They de&s;ired Ea&s;e. But on a &s;udden this Com|mittee
was di&s;continued, and never after revived; the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI>
never afterwards being &s;olicitous for it.</P>
<P>THE Argument was now to be debated among&s;t them&s;elves, that They
might agree what would plea&s;e them:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Roman Catholicks <HI>di&s; agree among&s;t them&s;elves</HI></NOTE> And then there quickly appeared that<MILESTONE N="50">
Di&s;cord and Animo&s;ity between them, that never was nor ever will be
extingui&s;hed; and of which the State might make much other U&s;e than
it hath done. The Lords and Men of E&s;tates were not &s;atisfied, in that
<PB N="143" REF="150">
They ob&s;erved the Good-Nature of the Hou&s;e did not appear to extend
farther, than the aboli&s;hing tho&s;e Laws which concerned the Lives of the
Prie&s;ts, which did not much affect them: For be&s;ides that tho&s;e Specta|cles
were no longer grateful to the People, They were confident that They
&s;hould not be without Men to di&s;charge tho&s;e Functions; and the Number
of &s;uch was more grievous to them than the Scarcity. That which They de|&s;ired
was, the Removal of tho&s;e Laws, which being let loo&s;e would de|prive
them of &s;o much of their E&s;tates, that the Remainder would not pre|&s;erve
them from Poverty. This Indulgence would indeed be grateful to
<MILESTONE N="10">them; for the other They cared not. Nor were the Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks at all
plea&s;ed with what was propo&s;ed for their Advantage, but looked upon
them&s;elves as deprived of the Honour of Martyrdom by this Remi&s;&s;ion,
that They might undergo Re&s;traints, which would be more grievous than
Death it&s;elf: And They were very apprehen&s;ive, that there would remain
&s;ome Order of them excluded, as there was even a mo&s;t univer&s;al Prejudice
again&s;t the <HI>Je&s;uits;</HI> or that there would be &s;ome Limitation of their Num|bers,
which They well knew the <HI>Catholicks</HI> in general would be very glad of,
though They could not appear to de&s;ire it.</P>
<P>THERE was a Committee cho&s;en among&s;t them of the Superiours of all
<MILESTONE N="20">Orders, and of the &s;ecular Clergy, that &s;ate at <HI>Arundel-Hou&s;e,</HI> and con&s;ulted
together with &s;ome of the principal Lords and others of the prime Quality
of that Religion, what They &s;hould &s;ay or do in &s;uch and &s;uch Ca&s;es which
probably might fall out. They all concluded, at lea&s;t apprehended, that They
&s;hould never be di&s;pen&s;ed with in Re&s;pect of the Oaths, which were enjoined
to be taken by all Men, without their &s;ubmitting to take &s;ome other Oath,
that might be an equal Security of and for their Fidelity to the King, and
the Pre&s;ervation of the Peace of the Kingdom. And there had been lately &s;cat|tered
abroad &s;ome printed Papers, written by &s;ome Regular and Secular
Clergy, with &s;ober Propo&s;itions to that Purpo&s;e, and even the Form of an
<MILESTONE N="30">Oath and Sub&s;cription to be taken or made by all <HI>Catholicks;</HI> in which there
was an ab&s;olute Renunciation or Declaration again&s;t the temporal Authority
of the Pope, which, in all common Di&s;cour&s;es among&s;t the <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> all
<HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> made no Scruple to renounce and di&s;claim: But it coming
now to be the Subject-Matter of the Debate in this Committee, the <HI>Je&s;uits.</HI>
declared with much Warmth, &startq;that They ought not, nor could They with a
good Con&s;cience as <HI>Catholicks,</HI> deprive the Pope of his temporal Authority,
which He hath in all Kingdoms granted to him by God him&s;elf,&endq; with very
much to that Purpo&s;e; with which mo&s;t of the temporal Lords, and very
many of the Seculars and Regulars, were &s;o much &s;candalized, that the
<MILESTONE N="40">Committee being broken up for that Time, They never attended it again;
the wi&s;er and the more con&s;cientious Men di&s;cerning, that there was a Spirit
in the re&s;t that was rai&s;ed and governed by a Pa&s;&s;ion, of which They could
not comprehend the Ground. And the Truth is, the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> and They
who adhered to them, had entertained great Hopes from the King's too
much Grace to them, and from the great Liberty They enjoyed; and
promi&s;ed them&s;elves and their Friends another Kind of Indulgence, than
They &s;aw was intended to them by the Hou&s;e of Peers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Upon which the Committee is $word$.</NOTE> And this was the
Rea&s;on that that Committee was no more looked after, nor any publick
Addre&s;s was any farther pro&s;ecuted.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50">AND from this Time there every Day appeared &s;o much In&s;olence and
Indi&s;cretion among&s;t the imprudent <HI>Catholicks,</HI> that They brought &s;o many
Scandals upon his Maje&s;ty, and kindled &s;o much Jealou&s;y in the Parlia|ment,
that there grew a general Aver&s;ion towards them. And the King's
<PB N="144" REF="151">
Party remembered, with what Warine&s;s and Di&s;regard the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI>
had lived towards them in the whole Time of the U&s;urpation; and how
little Sorrow They made Show of upon the horrid Murder of the King
(which was then exceedingly taken Notice of): And They who had been
abroad with the King remembered, that his Maje&s;ty had received le&s;s Re|gard
and Re&s;pect from his Catholick Subjects, wherever He found them
abroad, than from any foreign <HI>Catholicks;</HI> who always received him
with all imaginable Duty, whil&s;t his own looked as if They had no De|pendance
upon him. And &s;o We return to the Parliament after its Ad|journment.<MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>THE Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment meets again.</NOTE> that had been adjourned upon the thirtieth of <HI>July,</HI>
met again upon the twentieth of <HI>November,</HI> with the &s;ame Zeal and Affec|tion
to advance the King's Service. And the King him&s;elf came to them
upon the &s;ame Day They met,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Speech.</NOTE> and told them, &startq;that He knew that Vi&s;it
was not of Cour&s;e; yet if there were no more in it, it would not be
&s;trange, that He came to &s;ee what He and They had &s;o long de&s;ired to
&s;ee, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons of <HI>England,</HI>
met together to con&s;ult for the Peace and Safety of the Church and
State, by which Parliaments were re&s;tored to their primitive Lu&s;tre
and Integrity:&endq; His Maje&s;ty &s;aid, &startq;He did heartily congratulate with<MILESTONE N="20">
them for that Day.&endq; But He told them withal, &startq;that He came thither
upon another Occa&s;ion; which was to &s;ay &s;omewhat to them on his own
Behalf, to a&s;k &s;omewhat of them for him&s;elf, which was more than He
had done of them, or of tho&s;e who met before them, &s;ince his Coming
into <HI>England.</HI> Nor did He think, that what He had to &s;ay to them did
alone, or did mo&s;t concern him&s;elf: If the unea&s;y Condition He was in,
if the Streights and Nece&s;&s;ities He was to &s;truggle with, did not manife&s;tly
relate to the publick Peace and Safety, more than to his own Particular,
otherwi&s;e than as He was concerned in the Publick, He would not give
them that Trouble that Day; He could bear his Nece&s;&s;ities which merely<MILESTONE N="30">
related to him&s;elf, with Patience enough.&endq;</P>
<P>HE told them, &startq;that He did not importune them to make more Ha&s;te
in the &s;ettling the con&s;tant Revenue of the Crown, than was agreeable to
the Method They had propo&s;ed to them&s;elves, nor to con&s;ider the in&s;up|portable
Weight that lay upon it, the Obligations it lay under to provide
for the Intere&s;t, Honour and Security of the Nation, in another Pro|portion
than in any former Times it had been obliged to: His Maje&s;ty
well knew, that They had very affectionately and worthily taken all that
into their Thoughts, and would proceed in it with Expedition: But that
He came to put them in Mind of the crying Debts which did every Day<MILESTONE N="40">
call upon him, of &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ions, which were to be made
without Delay for the very Safety of the Kingdom, of the great Sum of
Money that &s;hould be ready to di&s;charge the &s;everal Fleets when they
came Home, and for the nece&s;&s;ary Preparations that were to be made for
the &s;etting out new Fleets to Sea again&s;t the next Spring. The&s;e were the
pre&s;&s;ing Occa&s;ions which He was forced to recommend to them with all
po&s;&s;ible Earne&s;tne&s;s, and He did conjure them to provide for as &s;peedily as
was po&s;&s;ible, and in &s;uch a Manner as might give them Security at Home,
and &s;ome Reputation abroad.&endq; His Maje&s;ty &s;aid, &startq;that He made this
Di&s;cour&s;e to them with &s;ome Confidence, becau&s;e He was very willing<MILESTONE N="50">
and de&s;irous that They &s;hould thoroughly examine, whether tho&s;e Ne|ce&s;&s;ities
which He mentioned were real or imaginary, or whether they
were fallen upon him by his own Fault, his own ill Managery, or Ex|ce&s;&s;es,
<PB N="145" REF="152">
and provide for them accordingly. He was very willing that They
&s;hould make a full In&s;pection into his Revenue, as well the Di&s;bur&s;ements
as Receipts; and if They &s;hould find that it had been ill managed by
any Corruptions in the Officers He tru&s;ted, or by his own Unthriftine&s;s,
He &s;hould take the Advice and Information They &s;hould give him very
kindly.&endq;</P>
<P>HE told them, &startq;that He was very &s;orry that the general Temper and Af|fections
of the Nation were not &s;o well compo&s;ed, as He hoped they would
have been, after &s;o &s;ignal Ble&s;&s;ings from God Almighty upon them all,
<MILESTONE N="10">and after &s;o great Indulgence and Conde&s;cen&s;ions from him towards all
Intere&s;ts. But that there were many wicked In&s;truments &s;till as active as
ever, who laboured Night and Day to di&s;turb the publick Peace, and to
make all People jealous of each other: It would be worthy their Care
and Vigilance to provide proper Remedies for the Di&s;ea&s;es of that Kind;
and if They &s;hould find new Di&s;ea&s;es, They mu&s;t &s;tudy new Remedies.
For tho&s;e Difficulties which concerned Matters in Religion,&endq; his Maje&s;ty
confe&s;&s;ed to them, &startq;that they were too hard for him; and therefore He
did recommend them to their Care and Di&s;cretion, which could be&s;t pro|vide
for them.&endq;</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20">THE two Hou&s;es were abundantly plea&s;ed with all that his Maje&s;ty had
&s;aid to them, and immediately betook them to the Con&s;ideration of tho&s;e
Particulars, which He had principally recommended to them. And though
for the pre&s;ent They looked upon that Clau&s;e of his Maje&s;ty's Speech,
wherein He referred to them to make an In&s;pection into his Revenue and
his Expen&s;es, but as a generous and princely Conde&s;cen&s;ion, which would
not become them to make U&s;e of (nor indeed had They at that Time the
lea&s;t Prejudice to or Jealou&s;y of any, who were of the neare&s;t Tru&s;t about
his Maje&s;ty); yet four Years after, when the Expen&s;es had grown to be
much greater, and it may be all Di&s;bur&s;ements not &s;o warrantable, and
<MILESTONE N="30">when the Factions in Court and Parliament were at a great Height, and
Men made U&s;e of publick Pretences to &s;atisfy their private Animo&s;ities and
Malice, They made U&s;e of that frank Offer of his Maje&s;ty, to entitle them|&s;elves
to make Inqui&s;ition into publick and private Receipts and Di&s;bur&s;e|ments,
in a very extraordinary Manner never practi&s;ed before.</P>
<P>LET no Man wonder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rea&s;on why the King's Debts were &s;o great.</NOTE> that within &s;o little Time as a Year and a Half
or very little more after the King's Return, that is, from <HI>May</HI> to <HI>November</HI>
in the next Year, and after &s;o great Sums of Money rai&s;ed by Acts of Par|liament
upon the People, his Maje&s;ty's Debts could be &s;o crying and im|portunate,
as to di&s;turb him to that Degree as He expre&s;&s;ed. It was never
<MILESTONE N="40">enough under&s;tood, that in all that Time He never received from the Par|liament
more than the &s;eventy thou&s;and Pounds towards his Coronation;
nor were the Debts which were now &s;o grievous to him contracted by him|&s;elf
(though it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed but that He had contracted Debts him|&s;elf
in that Time): All the Money that had been given and rai&s;ed had been
applied to the Payment of the Land and Sea Forces, and had done neither.
Parliaments do &s;eldom make their Computations right, but reckon what
They give to be much more than is ever received, and what They are
to pay to be as much le&s;s than in Truth They owe; &s;o that when all
the Money that was collected was paid, there remained &s;till very much
<MILESTONE N="50">due to the Soldiers, and much more to the Seamen: And the Clamour
from Both reached the King's Ears, as if They had been levied by his
Warrant and for his Service. And his Maje&s;ty under&s;tood too well, by
the Experience of the ill Hu&s;bandry of the la&s;t Year, when both the
<PB N="146" REF="153">
Army and the Ships were &s;o long continued in Pay, for Want of Money to
di&s;band and pay them off, what the Trouble and Charge would be, if the
&s;everal Fleets &s;hould return before Money was provided to di&s;charge the
Seamen; and for that the Clamour would be only upon him.</P>
<P>BUT there was an Expen&s;e that He had been engaged in from the Time
of his Return, and by which He had contracted a great Debt, of which
very few Men could take Notice; nor could the King think fit to di&s;cover
it, till He had fir&s;t provided again&s;t the Mi&s;chief which might have at|tended
the Di&s;covery. It will hardly be believed, that in &s;o warlike an Age,
and when the Armies and Fleets of <HI>England</HI> had made more Noi&s;e in the<MILESTONE N="10">
World for twenty Years, had fought more Battles at Land and Sea, than
all the World had done be&s;ides, or any one People had done in any Age
before; and when at his Maje&s;ty's Return there remained a hundred Ships
at Sea, and an Army of near three&s;core thou&s;and Men at Land; there
&s;hould not be in the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and in all the Stores belonging to
the Crown, Fire-Arms enough, nor indeed of any other Kind, to arm
three thou&s;and Men; nor Powder and naval Provi&s;ions enough to &s;et out
five Ships of War.</P>
<P>FROM the Death of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> no Care had been taken for Supplies of
any of the Stores. And the Changes which en&s;ued in the Government, and<MILESTONE N="20">
putting out and in new Officers; the Expeditions of <HI>Lambert</HI> again&s;t Sir
<HI>George Booth,</HI> and afterwards into the <HI>North;</HI> and other Preparations for
tho&s;e Factions and Parties which &s;ucceeded each other; and the continual
Opportunities which the Officers had for Embezzlement; and la&s;tly, the
&s;etting out that Fleet which was &s;ent to attend upon the King for his Re|turn;
had &s;o totally drained the Stores of all Kinds, that the Magazines
were no better repleni&s;hed than is mentioned before: Which as &s;oon as his
Maje&s;ty knew, as He could not be long ignorant of it, the fir&s;t Care He
took was to conceal it, that it might not be known abroad or at Home, in
how ill a Po&s;ture He was to defend him&s;elf again&s;t an Enemy. And then<MILESTONE N="30">
He committed the Care of that Province to a noble Per&s;on, whom He
knew He could not tru&s;t too much, and made Sir <HI>William Compton</HI> Ma&s;ter
of the Ordnance, and made all the Shifts He could devi&s;e for Monies, that
the Work might be begun. And hereby in&s;en&s;ibly He had contracted a
great Debt: And the&s;e were Part of the crying Debts, and the nece&s;&s;ary
Provi&s;ions which were to be made without Delay for the very Safety of the
Kingdom, which He told the Parliament. And in this He had laboured
&s;o effectually, that at the Time when the fir&s;t <HI>Dutch</HI> War was entered into,
all the Stores were more completely &s;upplied and provided for, and the

<P>THAT Part of the King's Speech, of the Di&s;tempers in the Nation by the

a &s;ea&s;onable Opportunity to enter upon the Relation, how that Affair &s;tood
at that Time, and how far the Di&s;tractions of tho&s;e &s;everal Factions were
from being reconciled, though Epi&s;copacy &s;eemed to be fully re&s;tored, and
the Bi&s;hops to their Votes in Parliament; which had been looked upon as
the mo&s;t &s;overeign Remedy,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An Account of the Revi&s;al of the</HI> Litur|$y.</NOTE> to cure, reform or extingui&s;h all tho&s;e Mala|dies.<MILESTONE N="50">
The Bi&s;hops had &s;pent the Vacation in making &s;uch Alterations in
the <HI>Book of Common Prayer,</HI> as They thought would make it more grateful
to the <HI>di&s;&s;enting Brethren,</HI> for &s;o the &s;chi&s;matical Party called them&s;elves;
<PB N="147" REF="154">
and &s;uch Additions, as in their Judgments the Temper of the pre&s;ent Time
and the pa&s;t Mi&s;carriages required. It was nece&s;&s;arily to be pre&s;ented to the
Convocation, which is the national Synod of the Church; and that did not
&s;it during the Rece&s;s of the Parliament, and &s;o came not together till the
End of <HI>November:</HI> Where the Con&s;ideration of it took up much Time;
all Men offering &s;uch Alterations and Additions, as were &s;uitable to their
own Fancies, and the Ob&s;ervations which They had made in the Time of
Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE Bi&s;hops were not all of one Mind.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Some of the Bi&s;hops are again&s;t all Al|terations in the</HI> Liturgy.</NOTE> Some of them, who had greate&s;t
<MILESTONE N="10">Experience and were in Truth wi&s;e Men, thought it be&s;t &startq;to re&s;tore and

and that it would be the be&s;t Vindication the <HI>Liturgy</HI> and Go|vernment
of the Church could receive, that after &s;o many Scandals and
Reproaches ca&s;t upon Both, and after a bloody Rebellion and a War of
twenty Years rai&s;ed, as was pretended, principally again&s;t Both, and which
had prevailed and triumphed in the total Suppre&s;&s;ion and De&s;truction of
Both, they &s;hould now be re&s;tored to be in all Re&s;pects the &s;ame they
had been before. Whereas any Alterations and Additions (be&s;ides the Ad|vantage
it might give to the common Adver&s;ary, the <HI>Papi&s;t,</HI> who would
<MILESTONE N="20">be apt to &s;ay that We had reformed and changed our Religion again),
would rai&s;e new Scruples in the factious and &s;chi&s;matical Party, that was
a&s;hamed of all the old Arguments, which had &s;o often been an&s;wered, and
&s;tood at pre&s;ent exploded in the Judgment of all &s;ober Men; but would
recover new Spirits to make new Objections, and complain that the Al|terations
and Additions are more grievous and burden&s;ome to the Li|berty
of their Con&s;cience, than tho&s;e of which They had formerly com|plained.&endq;</P>
<P>OTHERS,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Others of them pre&s;s earne&s;tly for &s;ome.</NOTE> equally grave, of great Learning and unblemi&s;hed Reputation,
pre&s;&s;ed earne&s;tly both for the Alterations and Additions; &s;aid, &startq;that it was
<MILESTONE N="30">a common Reproach upon the Government of the Church, that it would
not depart from the lea&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary Expre&s;&s;ion or Word, nor explain
the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant Ceremony; which would quiet or remove the
Doubts and Jealou&s;ies of many con&s;cientious Men, that they did in Truth
&s;ignify &s;omewhat that was not intended: And therefore &s;ince &s;ome pow|erful
Men of that trouble&s;ome Party had made it their earne&s;t Reque&s;t,
that &s;ome &s;uch Alterations and Additions might be made, and profe&s;&s;ed
that it would give great Satisfaction to many very good Men; it would
be great Pity, now there was a fit Opportunity for it, which had not been
in former Times of Clamour, not to gratify them in tho&s;e &s;mall Particu|lars,
<MILESTONE N="40">which did not make any important Difference from what was before.&endq;
It may be there were &s;ome, who believed that the Victory and Triumph of
the Church would be with the more Lu&s;tre, if &s;omewhat were in&s;erted,
that might be under&s;tood to reflect upon the rude and rebellious Beha|viour
of the late Times, which had been regulated and conducted by that
Clergy: And &s;o both Additions and Alterations were made.</P>
<P>BUT the Truth is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The former Opinion the more prudent.</NOTE> what Show of Rea&s;on &s;oever and Appearance of Cha|rity
the latter Opinion &s;eemed to carry with it, the former Advice was the
more prudent, and would have prevented many Inconveniences which en|&s;ued.
Whatever had been pretended or de&s;ired, the Alterations which were
<MILESTONE N="50">made to plea&s;e them did not reduce one of them to the Obedience of the
Church; and the Additions rai&s;ed the Clamour higher than it had been.
And when it was evident that They &s;hould not be left longer without a Li|turgy,
<PB N="148" REF="155">
They cried aloud for the &s;ame They had before, though They had
inveighed again&s;t it for near a hundred Years together.</P>
<P>IT is an unhappy Policy,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The unhappy Policy of making Con|ce&s;&s;ions to the</HI> Di&s;&s;enters.</NOTE> and always unhappily applied, to imagine that
that <HI>Cla&s;&s;is</HI> of Men can be recovered and reconciled by partial Conce&s;&s;ions,
or granting le&s;s than They demand. And if all were granted, They would
have more to a&s;k, &s;omewhat as a Security for the Enjoyment of what is
granted, that &s;hall pre&s;erve their Power, and &s;hake the whole Frame of
the Government. Their Faction is their Religion: Nor are tho&s;e Combi|nations
ever entered into upon real and &s;ub&s;tantial Motives of Con&s;cience
how erroneous &s;oever, but con&s;i&s;t of many glutinous Materials, of Will,<MILESTONE N="10">
and Humour, and Folly, and Knavery, and Ambition, and Malice, which
make Men cling in&s;eparably together, till They have Satisfaction in all
their Pretences, or till They are ab&s;olutely broken and &s;ubdued, which may
always be more ea&s;ily done than the other. And if &s;ome few, how &s;ignal
&s;oever (which often deceives us), are &s;eparated and divided from the Herd
upon rea&s;onable Overtures, and &s;ecret Rewards which make the Overtures
look the more rea&s;onable; They are but &s;o many &s;ingle Men, and have no
more Credit and Authority (whatever They have had) with their Compa|nions,
than if They had never known them, rather le&s;s; being le&s;s mad
than They were makes them thought to be le&s;s fit to be believed. And<MILESTONE N="20">
They, whom You think You have recovered, carry always a Chagrin about
them, which makes them good for Nothing, but for In&s;tances to divert you
from any more of that Kind of Traffick.</P>
<P>AND it is very &s;trange, that the Clergy did not at this Time remember
what had &s;o lately befallen the poor Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> upon the Tran&s;|mi&s;&s;ion
of their <HI>Liturgy,</HI> which had been compo&s;ed with this very Pro&s;pect
that now dazzled their Eyes. &startq;To receive a Liturgy from <HI>England</HI> was
below the Dignity of that Nation, which were governed by their own
Laws, without Dependance upon any other. Be&s;ides there were many
Errors in that Liturgy that They could never &s;ubmit to, and &s;ome De|fects<MILESTONE N="30">
which ought to be &s;upplied; and if &s;uch a one &s;hould be compiled,
in which all tho&s;e Exceptions, which were well enough known, might be
provided for, They would gladly receive it.&endq; All this was carefully per|formed;
and what Reception it had afterwards is too well known, and will
ever be remembered by the Scars which &s;till remain from tho&s;e Wounds.
And then the great Objection that was mo&s;t impudently urged was, &startq;that
it differed from the Liturgy of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> which They were
ready to have received, and would have declared to the World, that the
two Nations had but one Religion; whereas the Book &s;ent to them would
have manife&s;ted the contrary, and was the Product of a few particular Men,<MILESTONE N="40">
to who&s;e Spirit and Humour They would not &s;acrifice their native Liberty
of Con&s;cience.&endq;</P>
<P>THEY of the &s;ame Fraternity in <HI>England</HI> at this pre&s;ent governed them|&s;elves
by the &s;ame Method,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>None of the</HI> Di&s;&s;enters <HI>gained by the Conce&s;&s;ions now made.</HI></NOTE> though, God be thanked, not yet with the
&s;ame Succe&s;s. And there is great Rea&s;on to believe, that the very Men,
who laboured &s;o much for the Alterations which were made, and profe&s;&s;ed
to receive &s;o much Satisfaction in them, did it for no other End, but to
procure more Opportunity to continue and enlarge the Contentions; and to
gain Excu&s;e and Credit to the ill Things They had done, by the Redre&s;s
and Reparation that was given them in the Amendment of many Particu|lars,<MILESTONE N="50">
again&s;t which They had always complained. There was not one of
them who had u&s;ed that Importunity and made that Profe&s;&s;ion, who af|terwards
<PB N="149" REF="156">
was conformable to the Government of the Church, or frequented
tho&s;e Churches where or when the <HI>Liturgy</HI> was u&s;ed.</P>
<P>WHILST the Clergy was bu&s;y and &s;olicitous to prepare this Remedy for
the pre&s;ent Di&s;tempers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The factious Preachers a&s;|&s;ume much Li|cen&s;e.</NOTE> the People of all the &s;everal Factions in Religion a&s;|&s;umed
more Licen&s;e than ever They had done. The <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> in all
their Pulpits inveighed again&s;t the <HI>Book of Common Prayer</HI> that They expected,
and took the &s;ame Liberty to inveigh again&s;t the Government of the Church,
as They had been accu&s;tomed to before the Return of the King; with Reflections
upon the Per&s;ons of the Bi&s;hops, as if They a&s;&s;umed a Juri&s;diction that was
<MILESTONE N="10">yet at lea&s;t &s;u&s;pended. And the other Factions in Religion, as if by Con|cert,
took the &s;ame Liberty in their &s;everal Congregations. The <HI>Anabap|ti&s;ts</HI>
and the <HI>Quakers</HI> made more Noi&s;e than ever, and a&s;&s;embled together
in greater Numbers, and talked what Reformations They expected in all
Particulars. The&s;e In&s;olencies offended the Parliament very much: And
the Hou&s;e of Commons expre&s;&s;ed much Impatience, that the <HI>Liturgy</HI> was
&s;o long in Preparation, that the <HI>Act of Uniformity</HI> might without Delay be
pa&s;&s;ed and publi&s;hed; not without &s;ome In&s;inuations and Reflections, that
his Maje&s;ty's Candour, and Admi&s;&s;ion of all Per&s;ons to re&s;ort to his Pre&s;ence,
and his Conde&s;cen&s;ion to confer with them, had rai&s;ed their Spirits to an
<MILESTONE N="20">In&s;olence in&s;upportable; and that Nothing could reduce them to the Tem|per
of good Subjects, but the highe&s;t Severity.</P>
<P>IT is very true, from the Time of his Maje&s;ty's Coming into <HI>England,</HI>
He had not been re&s;erved in the Admi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e who had been his
greate&s;t Enemies, to his Pre&s;ence. The Pre&s;byterian Mini&s;ters He received
with Grace; and did believe that He &s;hould work upon them by Per&s;ua&s;ions,
having been well acquainted with their common Arguments by the Con|ver&s;ation
He had had in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and was very able to confute them. The
<HI>Independents</HI> had as free Acce&s;s, both that He might hinder any Conjunc|tion
between the other Factions, and becau&s;e They &s;eemed wholly to depend
<MILESTONE N="30">upon his Maje&s;ty's Will and Plea&s;ure, without re&s;orting to the Parliament,
in which They had no Confidence; and had rather that Epi&s;copacy &s;hould
flouri&s;h again, than that the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> &s;hould govern. The King had
always admitted the <HI>Quakers</HI> for his Diverti&s;ement and Mirth, becau&s;e He
thought, that of all the Factions They were the mo&s;t innocent, and had
lea&s;t of Malice in their Natures again&s;t his Per&s;on and his Government:
And it was now too late, though He had a wor&s;e Opinion of them all, to re|&s;train
them from coming to him, till there &s;hould be &s;ome Law made to puni&s;h
them; and therefore He &s;till called upon the Bi&s;hops, to cau&s;e the <HI>Liturgy</HI>
to be expedited in the Convocation. And finding that tho&s;e Di&s;tempers
<MILESTONE N="40">had that Influence upon the Hou&s;e of Commons, that the Di&s;plea&s;ure and
Jealou&s;y which They conceived from thence did retard their Coun&s;els, and
made them le&s;s &s;olicitous to advance his Service in the &s;ettling his Revenue,
They having &s;ate near three Months after their coming together again upon
their Adjournment, without making any con&s;iderable Progre&s;s in it; He
&s;ent for the Speaker and the Hou&s;e of Commons to attend him at <HI>White|hall,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King &s;ends for the Hou&s;e of Commons to attend him at</HI> Whitehall.</NOTE>
where He &s;pake unto them, though very graciou&s;ly, in a Style that
&s;eemed to have more of Expo&s;tulation and Reprehen&s;ion than They had
been accu&s;tomed to.</P>
<P>HE &s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Speech to them.</NOTE> &startq;He &s;pake his Heart to them when He told them, that He
<MILESTONE N="50">did believe, that from the fir&s;t In&s;titution of Parliaments to that Hour,
there had never been a Hou&s;e of Commons fuller of Affection and Duty
to their King, than They were to him; never any that was more de|&s;irous
and &s;olicitous to gratify their King, than They were to oblige him;
<PB N="150" REF="157">
never a Hou&s;e of Commons, in which there were fewer Per&s;ons without
a full Mea&s;ure of Zeal for the Honour and Welfare of the King and
Country, than there are in this: In a Word,&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;He knew mo&s;t
of their Per&s;ons and Names, and could never hope to find better Men in
their Places. Yet after all this He could not but lament and even complain,
that He and They and the Kingdom were yet without that pre&s;ent Fruit and
Advantage, which They might rea&s;onably promi&s;e them&s;elves from &s;uch a
Harmony of Affections, and Unity in Re&s;olutions to advance the publick Ser|vice,
and to provide for the Peace and Security of the Kingdom; that They
did not expedite tho&s;e good Coun&s;els, which were mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for Both.<MILESTONE N="10">
He knew not how it came to pa&s;s, but for many Weeks pa&s;t, even &s;ince their
la&s;t Adjournment, private and particular Bu&s;ine&s;s had almo&s;t thru&s;t the
Con&s;ideration of the publick out of Doors; and He did not know that
They were nearer the &s;ettling his Revenue, than They had been at <HI>Chri&s;t|mas.</HI>
He was &s;ure He had communicated his Condition to them without
Re&s;erve; what He had coming in, and what his nece&s;&s;ary Di&s;bur&s;ements
were. And&endq; He &s;aid &startq;He was exceedingly deceived, if whatever They
gave him were any otherwi&s;e given to him, than to be i&s;&s;ued out for
their own U&s;e and Benefit; and if They con&s;idered it well, They would
find that They were the richer by what They gave, &s;ince it was all to be<MILESTONE N="20">
laid out that They might enjoy the re&s;t in Peace and Security.&endq;</P>
<P>HE &s;aid, &startq;He need not put them in Mind of the mi&s;erable Effects, that
had attended the Wants and Nece&s;&s;ities of the Crown; that He needed
not to tell them, that there was a Republican Party &s;till in the Kingdom,
which had the Courage &s;till to promi&s;e them&s;elves another Revolution:
And He thought He had as little Need to tell them, that the only Way,
with God's Ble&s;&s;ing, to di&s;appoint their Hopes, and indeed to reduce
them from tho&s;e extravagant Hopes and De&s;ires, was, to let them &s;ee
that They had &s;o provided for the Crown, that it had wherewithal to &s;up|port
it&s;elf, and to &s;ecure his People; which He was &s;ure was all He de|&s;ired,<MILESTONE N="30">
and de&s;ired only for their Pre&s;ervation. Therefore He conjured
them by all the Profe&s;&s;ions of Affection which They had made to him,
by all the Kindne&s;s which He knew They had for him, that They would,
after all their Deliberations, betake them&s;elves to &s;ome &s;peedy Re&s;olutions,
and &s;ettle &s;uch a real and &s;ub&s;tantial Revenue upon him, as might hold
&s;ome Proportion with the nece&s;&s;ary Expen&s;es He was at for the Peace and
Benefit and Honour of the Kingdom; that They who looked for Trou|bles
at Home might de&s;pair of their Wi&s;hes; and that our Neighbours
abroad, by &s;eeing that all is well at Home, might have that E&s;teem and
Value of his Maje&s;ty, as might &s;ecure the Honour and Intere&s;t of the<MILESTONE N="40">
Nation, and make the Happine&s;s of the Kingdom and of that City once
more the Admiration and Envy of the World.&endq;</P>
<P>HE told them, &startq;that He heard that They were very zealous for the
Church, and very &s;olicitous and even jealous that there was not Expedi|tion
enough u&s;ed in that Affair: He thanked them for it, &s;ince He pre|&s;umed
that it proceeded from a good Root of Piety and Devotion. But&endq;
He &s;aid &startq;that He mu&s;t tell them, that He had the wor&s;t Luck in the
World, if after all the Reproaches of being a <HI>Papi&s;t</HI> while He was abroad,
He was &s;u&s;pected to be a <HI>Presbyterian</HI> now He was come Home. He knew
They would not take it unkindly, if He told them, that He was as<MILESTONE N="50">
zealous for the Church of <HI>England</HI> as any of them could be, and was
enough acquainted with the Enemies of it on all Sides; that He was as
much in Love with the <HI>Book of Common Prayer</HI> as They could wi&s;h, and
<PB N="151" REF="158">
had Prejudice enough to tho&s;e who did not love it, who He hoped
in Time would be better informed, and &s;o change their Minds; and
They might be confident, He did as much de&s;ire to have an Uniformity
&s;ettled, as any Man among&s;t them. He prayed them to tru&s;t him in
that Affair, and promi&s;ed them to ha&s;ten the Di&s;patch of it with all con|venient
Speed; They might rely upon him in it.&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;He had
tran&s;mitted the <HI>Book of Common Prayer,</HI> with tho&s;e Alterations and Ad|ditions
which had been pre&s;ented to him by the Convocation, to the
Hou&s;e of Peers with his Approbation, that the <HI>Act of Uniformity</HI> might
<MILESTONE N="10">relate to it; &s;o that He pre&s;umed that it would &s;hortly be di&s;patched
there: And that when They had done all They could,&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;the
well &s;ettling that Affair would require great Prudence and Di&s;cretion, and
the Ab&s;ence of all Pa&s;&s;ion and Precipitation.&endq;</P>
<P>HIS Maje&s;ty concluded with a&s;&s;uring them, &startq;that He did promi&s;e him|&s;elf
great Fruits from that Conver&s;ation He had with them, and that
They would ju&s;tify the Confidence He had in their Affections, by letting
the World &s;ee, that They took his Concernments to Heart, and were
ready to do what&s;oever He de&s;ired for the Peace and Welfare of the

<P><MILESTONE N="20">WHEN the <HI>Book of Common Prayer</HI> was,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Liturgy <HI>pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e of Lords with the King's Confir|mation.</HI></NOTE> by the King's Command, pre|&s;ented
to the Hou&s;e of Lords by the two Archbi&s;hops (for it had been ap|proved
by the Convocation of the Province of <HI>York,</HI> as well as by that of <HI>Can|terbury</HI>)
confirmed by his Maje&s;ty under the Great Seal of <HI>England;</HI> the
Book it&s;elf took up no Debate: Only the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> pro|po&s;ed,
&startq;that the old <HI>Book of Common Prayer</HI> might be confirmed with|out
any Alteration or Addition, and then the &s;ame <HI>Act of Uniformity,</HI>
that had been in the Time of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> would be likewi&s;e ap|plied
to it; whereas a new Act of Uniformity might take up much
Time and rai&s;e much Debate, all which would be avoided by adhering
<MILESTONE N="30">to the old.&endq;</P>
<P>WHATEVER that Lord's Opinion was, He was known to be of the Pre&s;by|terian
Party. And it was an&s;wered, &startq;that if that Propo&s;ition had been heartily
made when the King came into <HI>England,</HI> it would have met with a ge|neral
Approbation, and prevented much Sharpne&s;s and Animo&s;ity, which
had &s;ince ri&s;en by tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed that excellent Form. But after the
Clergy had &s;o bitterly inveighed again&s;t many Parts thereof, and prevailed
with his Maje&s;ty to &s;u&s;pend the U&s;e of it till it might be revi&s;ed, as by
his Declaration of the five and twentieth of <HI>October</HI> He had done, and

<MILESTONE N="40">to &s;everal Bi&s;hops and other Divines, to review the <HI>Book of Common Prayer,</HI>

of &s;everal Prayers to be u&s;ed upon emergent Occa&s;ions, all which his Ma|je&s;ty
<MILESTONE N="50">had already ratified and confirmed: It could not but be under&s;tood

<P>BUT then the <HI>Act of Uniformity</HI> depended long, and took up much Debate
in Both Hou&s;es. In the Hou&s;e of Peers, where the Act fir&s;t began, there were

&s;ome, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Benefices with Cure of Souls, and other Eccle&s;ia&s;tical
Promotions, who had never received Orders but in <HI>France</HI> or in <HI>Holland;</HI>
and the&s;e Men mu&s;t now receive new Ordination, which had been always
held unlawful in the Church, or by this Act of Parliament mu&s;t be de|prived
of their Livelihood, which They enjoyed in the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing and
peaceable Time of the Church. And therefore it was &s;aid, &startq;that this had<MILESTONE N="20">
not been the Opinion of the Church of <HI>England;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Upon the Clau&s;e re|quiring Epi&s;|copal Ordina|tion.</NOTE> and that it would lay
a great Reproach upon all other Prote&s;tant Churches who had no Bi|&s;hops,
as if They had no Mini&s;ters, and con&s;equently were no Churches:
For that it was well known the Church of <HI>England</HI> did not allow Reor|dination,
as the ancient Church never admited it; in&s;omuch as if any
Prie&s;t of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> renounces the Communion thereof, his Or|dination
is not que&s;tioned, but He is as capable of any Preferment in this
Church, as if He had been ordained in it. And therefore the not ad|mitting
the Mini&s;ters of other <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> to have the &s;ame Privilege,
can proceed from no other Ground, than that They looked not upon<MILESTONE N="30">
them as Mini&s;ters, having no Ordination; which is a Judgment the
Church of <HI>England</HI> had not ever owned: And that it would be very im|prudent
to do it now.&endq;</P>
<P>To this it was an&s;wered, &startq;that the Church of <HI>England</HI> judged none but
her own Children, nor did determine that other Prote&s;tant Churches were
without Ordination. It is a Thing without her Cognizance: And mo&s;t
of the learned Men of tho&s;e Churches had made Nece&s;&s;ity the chief Pil|lar
to &s;upport that Ordination of theirs. That Nece&s;&s;ity cannot be
pleaded here, where Ordination is given according to the unque&s;tionable
Practice of the Church of Chri&s;t: If They who pretend foreign Ordina|tion<MILESTONE N="40">
are his Maje&s;ty's Subjects, They have no Excu&s;e of Nece&s;&s;ity, for
They might in all Times have received Epi&s;copal Ordination, and &s;o
They did upon the Matter renounce their own Church; if They are
Strangers, and pretend to Preferment in this Church, They ought to
conform and to be &s;ubject to the Laws of the Kingdom, which con|cern
only tho&s;e who de&s;ire to live under the Protection thereof. For the
Argument of Reordination, there is no &s;uch Thing required. Rebapti|zation
is not allowed in or by any Church: Yet in all Churches where it
is doubted, as it may be often with very good Rea&s;on, whether the Per|&s;on
hath been baptized or no, or if it hath been baptized by a Midwife<MILESTONE N="50">
or lay Per&s;on; without determining the Validity or Invalidity of &s;uch
Bapti&s;m, there is an hypothetical Form, <HI>If Thou ha&s;t not been already
baptized, I do baptize,</HI> &amp;c. So in this Ca&s;e of Ordination, the Form may
<PB N="153" REF="160">
be the &s;ame, <HI>If Thou ha&s;t not been already ordained, then I do
ordain,</HI> &amp;c. If his former Ordination were good, this is void; if
the other was invalid or defective, He hath Rea&s;on to be glad that it be
thus &s;upplied.&endq; After much Debate, that Clau&s;e remained &s;till in the
Act: And very many, who had received Pre&s;byterian Orders in the late
Times, came very willingly to be ordained in the Manner afore&s;aid by a
Bi&s;hop; and very few cho&s;e to quit or lo&s;e a Par&s;onage or Vicarage of any
Value upon that Scruple.</P>
<P>THERE was another Clau&s;e in the Bill,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Clamour af|terwards rai&s;ed about the Clau&s;e of</HI> A&s;&s;ent <HI>and</HI> Con&s;ent.</NOTE> that made very much more Noi&s;e
<MILESTONE N="10">afterwards, though for the pre&s;ent it took not up &s;o much Time, and in
Truth was little taken Notice of: That is, a Form of Sub&s;cription that
every Man was to make, who had received, or before He received, any Be|nefice
or Preferment in the Church; which comprehended all the Governours,
Superiours and Fellows, in all the Colleges and Halls of either Univer&s;ity, and
all Schoolma&s;ters and the like, who are &s;ub&s;ervient towards Learning. Every
&s;uch Per&s;on was to declare &startq;his unfeigned A&s;&s;ent and Con&s;ent to all and every
Thing contained and pre&s;cribed in and by the Book, entitled <HI>The Book of
Common Prayer,</HI> &amp;c.&endq; The Sub&s;cription was generally thought &s;o rea|&s;onable,
that it &s;carce met with any Oppo&s;ition in either Hou&s;e. But when
<MILESTONE N="20">it came abroad, and was to be &s;ubmitted to, all the di&s;&s;enting Brethren
cried out, &startq;that it was a Snare to catch them, to &s;ay that which could not
con&s;i&s;t with their Con&s;ciences.&endq; They took great Pains to di&s;tingui&s;h and
to make great Difference between <HI>A&s;&s;ent</HI> and <HI>Con&s;ent:</HI> &startq;They could be
content to read the Book in the Manner They were obliged to do, which
&s;hewed their Con&s;ent; but declaring their unfeigned A&s;&s;ent to every
Thing contained and pre&s;cribed therein would imply, that They were &s;o
fully convinced in their Judgments, as to think that it was &s;o perfect, that
Nothing therein could be amended, which for their Part They thought
there might. That there were many Expre&s;&s;ions in the <HI>Rubrick,</HI> which
<MILESTONE N="30">They were not bound to read; yet by this A&s;&s;ent They declared their
Approbation thereof.&endq; But after many tedious Di&s;cour&s;es of this tyran|nical
Impo&s;ition, They grew by Degrees a&s;hamed of it; and were per&s;uaded
to think, that <HI>A&s;&s;ent</HI> and <HI>Con&s;ent</HI> had &s;o near the &s;ame Signification, that
They could hardly con&s;ent to do what They did not a&s;&s;ent to: So that
the chiefe&s;t among&s;t them, to avoid a very little Inconvenience, &s;ub&s;cribed
the &s;ame.</P>
<P>BUT there was &s;hortly after another Clau&s;e added, that gave them
Trouble indeed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bill pa&s;&s;ed by the Lords.</NOTE> When the Bill had pa&s;&s;ed the Lords Hou&s;e, it was
&s;ent of Cour&s;e to the Commons; where though all the Factions in Re|ligion
<MILESTONE N="40">had too many Friends, for the mo&s;t contrary and oppo&s;ite one to
another always were united and reconciled again&s;t the Church, yet They
who were zealous for the Government, and who hated all the other Factions
at lea&s;t enough, were very much &s;uperiour in Number and in Reputation.
And the Bill was no &s;ooner read there, than every Man according to his
Pa&s;&s;ion thought of adding &s;omewhat to it, that might make it more
grievous to Somebody whom He did not love; which made the Di&s;cour&s;es
tedious and vehement and full of Animo&s;ity.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Amendments made by the Hou&s;e of Com|mons.</NOTE> And at la&s;t They agreed
upon a Clau&s;e, which contained another Sub&s;cription and Declaration,
which every Man was to make before He could be admitted into any Benefice
<MILESTONE N="50">or Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Promotion, or to be a Governour or Fellow in either of the
Univer&s;ities. He mu&s;t fir&s;t declare, &startq;that it is not lawful, upon any Pre|tence
what&s;oever, to take Arms again&s;t the King; and that He doth ab|hor
that traiterous Po&s;ition of taking Arms by his Authority again&s;t his
<PB N="154" REF="161">
Per&s;on, or again&s;t tho&s;e that are commi&s;&s;ioned by him; and that He will
conform to the <HI>Liturgy</HI> of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as it is now by Law e&s;ta|bli&s;hed.&endq;
And He doth declare, &startq;that He doth hold there lies no Obli|gation
upon him, or on any other Per&s;on, from the Oath commonly called
<HI>The &s;olemn League and Covenant,</HI> to endeavour any Change or Alteration
of Government, either in Church or State; and that the &s;ame was in it|&s;elf
an unlawful Oath, and impo&s;ed upon the Subjects of this Realm,
again&s;t the known Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom;&endq; with &s;ome other
Clau&s;es, which need not be mentioned becau&s;e they were afterwards left out.
And with this Addition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bill re|turned to the Lords.</NOTE> and &s;ome other Alterations, They returned the Bill<MILESTONE N="10">
again to the Lords for their Approbation.</P>
<P>THE framing and forming this Clau&s;e had taken up very much Time,
and rai&s;ed no le&s;s Pa&s;&s;ion in the Hou&s;e of Commons: And now it came
among the Lords, it was not le&s;s trouble&s;ome. It added to the Di&s;plea&s;ure
and Jealou&s;y again&s;t the Bi&s;hops, by whom it was thought to be prepared,
and commended to their Party in the lower Hou&s;e. Many Lords, who had
taken the <HI>Covenant,</HI> were not &s;o much concerned that the Clergy (for whom
only this Act was prepared) &s;hould be obliged to make this Declaration;
but apprehended more, that when &s;uch a Clau&s;e &s;hould be once pa&s;&s;ed in
one Act of Parliament, it could not after be di&s;puted, and &s;o would be<MILESTONE N="20">
in&s;erted into all other Acts which related to the Function of any other
Offices, and &s;o would in a &s;hort Time be required of them&s;elves. And
therefore They oppo&s;ed it warmly &startq;as a Thing unnece&s;&s;ary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates upon the Amend|ments made by the Commons.</NOTE> and which would
widen the Breach, in&s;tead of clo&s;ing up the Wounds that had been made;
which the King had made it his Bu&s;ine&s;s to do, and the Parliament had
hitherto concurred with his Maje&s;ty in that Endeavour. That many Men
would believe or fear (which in &s;uch a Ca&s;e is the &s;ame), that this Clau&s;e
might prove a Breach of the <HI>Act of Indemnity,</HI> which had not only pro|vided
again&s;t Indictments and Suits at Law and Penalties, but again&s;t Re|proaches
for what was pa&s;t, which this Clau&s;e would be under&s;tood to<MILESTONE N="30">
give new Life to. For what concerned the Conformity to the <HI>Liturgy</HI>
of the Church as it is now e&s;tabli&s;hed, it is provided for as fully
in the former Sub&s;cription in this Act, and therefore is impertinent
in this Place. That the <HI>Covenant</HI> contained many good Things in it,
as defending the King's Per&s;on, and maintaining the Prote&s;tant Reli|gion:
And therefore to &s;ay that there lies no Obligation from it, would
neither be for the Service of the King or the Intere&s;t of the Church;
e&s;pecially &s;ince it was well known, that it had wrought upon the Con|&s;cience
of many to &s;erve the King in the late Revolution, from which
his Maje&s;ty had received great Advantage. However it was now dead,<MILESTONE N="40">
all Men were ab&s;olved from taking it, nor could it be impo&s;ed or offered
to any Man without Puni&s;hment; and They, who had in the ill Times
been forced to take it, did now inviolably and cheerfully perform all the
Duties of Allegiance and Fidelity to his Maje&s;ty. If it had at any Time
produced any Good, that was an Excu&s;e for the Irregularity of it: It
could do no Mi&s;chief for the future; and therefore that it was Time to
bury it in Oblivion.&endq;</P>
<P>MANY Men believed, that though They in&s;i&s;ted principally on that Part
which related to the <HI>Covenant,</HI> They were in Truth more afflicted with
the fir&s;t Part; in which it was declared, &startq;that it was not lawful, upon<MILESTONE N="50">
any Pretence what&s;oever, to take Arms again&s;t the King; and that He
doth abhor that traiterous Po&s;ition of taking Arms by his Authority
again&s;t his Per&s;on:&endq; Which Conclu&s;ions had been the Principles which
<PB N="155" REF="162">
&s;upported their Rebellion, and by which They had impo&s;ed upon the Peo|ple,
and got their Concurrence. They dur&s;t not oppo&s;e this, becau&s;e the
Parliament had already by a former Act declared the Law to be &s;o in tho&s;e
Particulars: Yet this went much nearer to them, that by their own parti|cular
Declaration (for They looked upon it as that which in a &s;hort Time
mu&s;t be their own), They &s;hould upon the Matter confe&s;s them&s;elves to
have been Traitors, which They had not yet been declared to have been;
and no Man could now ju&s;tify the calling them &s;o.</P>
<P>THEY who were mo&s;t &s;olicitous that the Hou&s;e &s;hould concur with the
<MILESTONE N="10">Commons in this Addition, had Fieldroom enough to expatiate upon the
gro&s;s Iniquity of the <HI>Covenant.</HI> They made them&s;elves very merry with the
Allegation, &startq;that the King's Safety and the Intere&s;t of the Church were
provided for by the <HI>Covenant,</HI> when it had been therefore entered into, to
fight again&s;t the King and to de&s;troy the Church. That there was no
one lawful or hone&s;t Clau&s;e in the <HI>Covenant,</HI> that was not de&s;troyed or
made of no Signification by the next that &s;ucceeded; and if it were not,
the &s;ame Obligation was better provided for by &s;ome other Oaths, which
the &s;ame Men had or ought to have taken, and which ought to have
re&s;trained them from taking the <HI>Covenant:</HI> And therefore it may ju&s;tly be
<MILESTONE N="20">pronounced, that there is no Obligation upon any Man from thence.
That there was no Breach of the <HI>Act of Indemnity,</HI> nor any Reproach
upon any Man for having taken it, except what would re&s;ult from his
own Con&s;cience. But that it was mo&s;t ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the Safety
of the King's Per&s;on, and the Peace of the Kingdom, that They who
had taken it &s;hould declare, that They do not believe them&s;elves to be
bound by it: Otherwi&s;e They may &s;till think, that They may fight
again&s;t the King, and mu&s;t con&s;pire the De&s;truction of the Church. And
They cannot take too much Care, or u&s;e too much Diligence, to di&s;co|ver
who are of that Opinion; that They may be &s;trictly looked unto,
<MILESTONE N="30">and re&s;trained from doing that which They take them&s;elves obliged
to do. That the <HI>Covenant</HI> is not dead, as was alleged, but &s;till retains
great Vigour; was &s;till the Idol to which the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> &s;acrificed:
And that there mu&s;t and would always be a general Jealou&s;y of all tho&s;e
who had taken it, until They had declared that it did not bind them;
e&s;pecially of the Clergy, who had &s;o often enlarged in their Pulpits, how
ab&s;olutely and indi&s;pen&s;ably all Men were obliged to pro&s;ecute the End
of it, which is to de&s;troy the Church, whatever Danger it brings the
King's Per&s;on to. And therefore They of all Men ought to be glad of
this Opportunity, that was offered, to vindicate their Loyalty and Obe|dience;
<MILESTONE N="40">and if They were not ready to do &s;o, They were not fit to be
tru&s;ted with the Charge and Care of the Souls of the King's Subjects.&endq;</P>
<P>AND in Truth there were not any more importunate for the enjoining
this Declaration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lords con|&s;ent to mo&s;t of the Amend|ments.</NOTE> than many who had taken the <HI>Covenant.</HI> Many who
had never taken it, and had always dete&s;ted it, and paid &s;oundly for
being known to do &s;o, were yet very &s;orry that it was in&s;erted at this
Time and in this Place; for They fore&s;aw it would make Divi&s;ions, and
keep up the &s;everal Factions, which would have been much weakened, and
in a &s;hort Time brought to Nothing, if the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> had been &s;epa|rated
from the re&s;t, who did perfectly hate and were as perfectly hated by
<MILESTONE N="50">all the re&s;t. But &s;ince it was brought upon the Stage, and it had been the
Subject of &s;o much Debate, They believed the Hou&s;e of Lords could not
now refu&s;e to concur with the Commons, without undergoing &s;ome Re|proach
and Scandal of not having an ill Opinion enough of the <HI>Covenant;</HI>
<PB N="156" REF="163">
of which as They were in no Degree guilty, &s;o They thought it to be of
mi&s;chievous Con&s;equence to be &s;u&s;pected to be &s;o. And therefore, after
They had expunged &s;ome other Parts of that Sub&s;cription which had been
annexed to it, and mended &s;ome other Expre&s;&s;ions in other Places, which
might rather irritate than compo&s;e tho&s;e Humours which already boiled
too much,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Commons agree with the Lords.</NOTE> They returned the Bill to the Hou&s;e of Commons; which &s;ub|mitted
to all that They had done: And &s;o it was pre&s;ented to the King,
who could not well refu&s;e his Royal A&s;&s;ent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King $word$ the Bill.</NOTE> nor did in his own Judgment
or Inclination di&s;like what was offered to him.</P>
<P>BY this <HI>Act of Uniformity</HI> there was an End put to all the Liberty and<MILESTONE N="10">
Licen&s;e, which had been practi&s;ed in all Churches from the Time of his
Maje&s;ty's Return, and by his Declaration that He had emitted afterwards.
The <HI>Common Prayer</HI> mu&s;t now be con&s;tantly read in all Churches, and no
other Form admitted: And what Clergyman &s;oever did not fully conform
to what&s;oever was contained in that Book, or enjoined by the <HI>Act of Uni|formity,</HI>
by or before <HI>St. Bartholomew-Day,</HI> which was about three Months
after the Act was publi&s;hed; He was <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> deprived of his Benefice, or
any other &s;piritual Promotion of which He &s;tood po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and the Patron
was to pre&s;ent another in his Place, as if He were dead: So that it was not
in the King's Power to give any Di&s;pen&s;ation to any Man, that could pre|&s;erve<MILESTONE N="20">
him again&s;t the Penalty in the <HI>Act of Uniformity.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Act was no &s;ooner publi&s;hed (for I am willing to continue this Re|lation
to the Execution of it, becau&s;e there were &s;ome intervening Accidents
that were not under&s;tood), than all the Pre&s;byterian Mini&s;ters expre&s;&s;ed
their Di&s;approbation of it with all the Pa&s;&s;ion imaginable. They com|plained
&startq;that the King had violated his Promi&s;e made to them in his De|claration
from <HI>Breda,</HI>&endq;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Presbyte|rian Mini&s;ters complain of the King's Violation of his</HI> Declara|tion.</NOTE> which was urged with great Uningenuity, and
without any Shadow of Right; for his Maje&s;ty had thereby referred the
whole Settlement of all Things relating to Religion, to the Wi&s;dom of Par|liament;
and declared, &startq;in the mean Time that Nobody &s;hould be puni&s;hed or<MILESTONE N="30">
que&s;tioned, for continuing the Exerci&s;e of his Religion in the Way He had been
accu&s;tomed to in the late Confu&s;ions.&endq; And his Maje&s;ty had continued this
Indulgence by his Declaration after his Return, and thereby fully complied
with his Promi&s;e from <HI>Breda;</HI> which He &s;hould indeed have violated, if He
had now refu&s;ed to concur in the Settlement the Parliament had agreed upon,
being in Truth no le&s;s obliged to concur with the Parliament in the Set|tlement
that the Parliament &s;hould propo&s;e to him, than He was not to cau&s;e
any Man to be puni&s;hed for not obeying the former Laws, till a new
Settlement &s;hould be made. But how evident &s;oever this Truth is, They
would not acknowledge it; but armed their Pro&s;elytes with confident A&s;|&s;ertions,<MILESTONE N="40">
and unnatural Interpretations of the Words in the King's Declara|tion,
as if the King were bound to grant Liberty of Con&s;cience, whatever
the Parliament &s;hould or &s;hould not de&s;ire, that is, to leave all Men to live
according to their own Humours and Appetites, let what Laws &s;oever be
made to the contrary. They declared &startq;that They could not with a good
Con&s;cience either &s;ub&s;cribe the one or the other Declaration: They could
not &s;ay that They did a&s;&s;ent or con&s;ent in the fir&s;t, nor declare in the
&s;econd that there remained no Obligation from the <HI>Covenant;</HI> and there|fore
that They were all re&s;olved to quit their Livings, and to depend upon
Providence for their Sub&s;i&s;tence.&endq;<MILESTONE N="50"></P>
<P>THERE cannot be a better Evidence of the general Affection of the
Kingdom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Act in general will recei$$d.</NOTE> than that this Act of Parliament had &s;o concurrent an Appro|bation
of the two Hou&s;es of Parliament, after a Suppre&s;&s;ion of that Form
<PB N="157" REF="164">
of Devotion for near twenty Years, and the highe&s;t Di&s;countenance and
Oppre&s;&s;ion of all tho&s;e who were known to be devoted or affected to it.
And from the Time of the King's Return, when it was lawful to u&s;e it,
though it was not enjoined, Per&s;ons of all Conditions flocked to tho&s;e Churches
where it was u&s;ed. And it was by very many &s;ober Men believed, that if
the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> and the other Factions in Religion had been only permit|ted
to exerci&s;e their own Ways, without any Countenance from the Court;
the Heart of all the Factions again&s;t the Church would have been broken, be|fore
the Parliament did &s;o fully declare it&s;elf.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10">AND there cannot be a greater Manife&s;tation of the Di&s;temper and Li|cen&s;e

the oppo&s;ing and contradicting an Act of Parliament; when there was &s;carce
a Man in that Number, who had not been &s;o great a Promoter of the
Rebellion, or contributed &s;o much to it, that They had no other Title to
their Lives but by the King's Mercy; and there were very few among&s;t
them, who had not come into the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Churches They now
held, by the Expul&s;ion of the Orthodox Mini&s;ters who were lawfully
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them, and who being by their Impri&s;onment, Poverty, and other
Kinds of Oppre&s;&s;ion and Contempt during &s;o many Years, departed this
<MILESTONE N="20">Life, the U&s;urpers remained undi&s;turbed in their Livings, and thought it
now the highe&s;t Tyranny to be removed from them, though for offending
the Law, and Di&s;obedience to the Government. That tho&s;e Men &s;hould
give them&s;elves an Act of Oblivion of all their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions and Wicked|ne&s;s,
and take upon them again to pretend a Liberty of Con&s;cience again&s;t
the Government, which They had once overthrown upon their Pretences;
was &s;uch an Impudence, as could not have fallen into the Hearts even of
tho&s;e Men from the Stock of their own Malice, without &s;ome great Defect
in the Government, and Encouragement or Countenance from the highe&s;t
Powers. The King's too gracious Di&s;po&s;ition and Ea&s;ine&s;s of Acce&s;s, as
<MILESTONE N="30">hath been &s;aid before, had from the Beginning rai&s;ed their Hopes and di&s;|pelled
their Fears; whil&s;t his Maje&s;ty promi&s;ed him&s;elf a great Harve&s;t in
their Conver&s;ion, by his Gentlene&s;s and Affability. And They in&s;inuated
them&s;elves by a Profe&s;&s;ion, &startq;that it was more the Regard of his Service,
than any Ob&s;tinacy in them&s;elves, which kept them from Conformity to
what the Law had enjoined; that They might &s;till pre&s;erve their Credit
with their Pari&s;hioners, and by Degrees bring them to a perfect Obedience:&endq;
Whereas indeed all the Corruption was in the Clergy; and where a prudent
and Orthodox Man was in the Pulpit, the People very willingly heard the
<HI>Common Prayer.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40">NOR did this Confidence leave them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They have too free $word$ to the King.</NOTE> after the pa&s;&s;ing and publi&s;hing

to bring them to the King, who always received them with too much Cle|mency,
and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with too much Hope. They lamented &startq;the
Sadne&s;s of their Condition, which (after having done &s;o much Service
to his Maje&s;ty, and been &s;o graciou&s;ly promi&s;ed by him his Protection)
mu&s;t now be expo&s;ed to all Mi&s;ery and Famine.&endq; They told him &startq;what
a va&s;t Number of Churches&endq; (five Times more than was true) &startq;would
<MILESTONE N="50">become void by this Act, which would not prove for his Service; and
that They much feared, the People would not continue as quiet and peace|able
as They had been under their Over&s;ight.&endq; They u&s;ed all the Ar|guments
They thought might work upon him: And He &s;eemed to be the
<PB N="158" REF="165">
more moved, becau&s;e He knew that it was not in his Power to help them.
He told them, &startq;He had great Compa&s;&s;ion for them; and was heartily
&s;orry that the Parliament had been &s;o &s;evere towards them, which He
would remit, if it were in his Power; and therefore that They &s;hould
advi&s;e with their Friends, and that if They found that it would be in his
Power to give them any Ea&s;e, They &s;hould find him inclined to gratify
them in what&s;oever They de&s;ired:&endq; Which gracious Expre&s;&s;ions rai&s;ed
their Spirits as high as ever; and They reported to their Friends much more
than in Truth the King had &s;aid to them (which was no new Artifice with
them), and advi&s;ed their Friends in all Parts &startq;to be firm to their Principles,&endq;<MILESTONE N="10">
and a&s;&s;ured them, &startq;that the Rigour of the Act of Parliament &s;hould not
be pre&s;&s;ed again&s;t them.&endq;</P>
<P>IT cannot be denied, that the King was too irre&s;olute, and apt to be
&s;haken in tho&s;e Coun&s;els which with the greate&s;t Deliberation He had con|cluded,
by too ea&s;ily permitting or at lea&s;t not re&s;training any Men who
waited upon him, or were pre&s;ent with him in his Rece&s;&s;es, to examine
and cen&s;ure what was re&s;olved; an Infirmity that brought him many Trou|bles,
and expo&s;ed his Mini&s;ters to Ruin: Though in his Nature, Judg|ment
and Inclinations He did dete&s;t the <HI>Presbyterians;</HI> and by the Expe|rience
He had of their Faculties, Pride and In&s;olence in <HI>Scotland,</HI> had<MILESTONE N="20">
brought from thence &s;uch an Abhorrence of them, that for their Sakes He
thought better of any of the other Factions. Nor had He any Kindne&s;s
for any Per&s;on whom He &s;u&s;pected to adhere to them: For the Lord <HI>Lau|therdale</HI>
took all Pains to be thought no <HI>Presbyterian;</HI> and plea&s;ed him&s;elf
better with no Humour, than laughing at that People, and telling ridiculous
Stories of their Folly and foul Corruptions. Yet the King, from the Opi|nion
He had of their great Power to do him Good or Harm, which was
oftentimes un&s;kilfully in&s;inuated to him by Men who He knew were not
of their Party, but were really deceived them&s;elves by a wrong Compu|tation
and E&s;timate of their Intere&s;t, was not willing to be thought an<MILESTONE N="30">
Enemy to them. And there were too many bold Speakers about the Court
too often admitted into his Pre&s;ence, who being without any Sen&s;e of Re|ligion,
thought all rather ought to be permitted, than to undergo any
Trouble and Di&s;turbance on the Behalf of any one.</P>
<P>THE continued Addre&s;s and Importunity of the&s;e Mini&s;ters, as <HI>St. Bar|tholomew's</HI>
Day approached nearer, more di&s;quieted the King. They
enlarged with many Words &startq;on the great Joy that They and all their
Friends had received, from the Compa&s;&s;ion his Maje&s;ty &s;o graciou&s;ly had
expre&s;&s;ed on their Behalf, which They would never forget, or forfeit by
any undutiful Carriage.&endq; They confe&s;&s;ed &startq;that They found, upon Con|ference<MILESTONE N="40">
with their Friends who wi&s;hed them well, and upon Peru&s;al of
the Act of Parliament, that it was not in his Maje&s;ty's Power to give
them &s;o much Protection again&s;t the Penalty of the Act of Parliament,
as They had hoped, and as his great Goodne&s;s was inclined to give them.
But that it would be an un&s;peakable Comfort to them, if his Maje&s;ty's
Grace towards them were &s;o manife&s;ted, that the People might di&s;cern that
this extreme Rigour was not grateful to him, but that He could be well
content if it were for &s;ome Time &s;u&s;pended; and therefore They were
humble Suitors to him, that He would by his Letters to the Bi&s;hops, or by
a Proclamation, or an Act of Council, or any other Way his Maje&s;ty<MILESTONE N="50">
&s;hould think fit, publi&s;h his De&s;ire that the Execution of the <HI>Act of
Uniformity,</HI> as to all but the Reading of the <HI>Liturgy,</HI> which They would
conform to, might be &s;u&s;pended for three Months; and that He would
<PB N="159" REF="166">
take it well from the Bi&s;hops or any of the Patrons, who would &s;o far
comply with his De&s;ire, as not to take any Advantage of tho&s;e Clau&s;es in
the Statute, which gave them Authority to pre&s;ent as in a Vacancy.
They doubted not there would be many, who would willingly &s;ubmit to
his Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure: But whatever the Effect &s;hould be, They would
pay the &s;ame humble Acknowledgments to his Maje&s;ty, as if it had pro|duced
all that They de&s;ired.&endq;</P>
<P>WHETHER his Maje&s;ty thought it would do them no Good, and there|fore
that it was no Matter if He granted it; or that He thought it no Pre|judice
<MILESTONE N="10">to the Church, if the Act were &s;u&s;pended for three Months; or that
He was willing to redeem him&s;elf from the pre&s;ent Importunity (an Infir|mity
He was too often guilty of): True it is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King pro|mi&s;es to &s;u&s;|pend the $$$|cution of the Act.</NOTE> He did make them a po&s;itive
Promi&s;e, &startq;that He would do what They de&s;ired;&endq; with which They were
abundantly &s;atisfied, and renewed their Encouragement to their Friends
&startq;to per&s;evere to the End.&endq; And this Promi&s;e was &s;olemnly given to
them in the Pre&s;ence of the General, who was to &s;olicit the King's Di&s;|patch,
that his Plea&s;ure might be known in due Time. It was now the
long Vacation, and few of the Council were then in Town, or of the Bi|&s;hops,
with whom his Maje&s;ty too late thought it nece&s;&s;ary to confer, that
<MILESTONE N="20">&s;uch an In&s;trument might be prepared as was fit for the Affair. Hereupon
the King told the Chancellor (who was not thought Friend enough to the
<HI>Presbyterians</HI> to be &s;ooner communicated with) all that had pa&s;&s;ed, what
the Mini&s;ters had de&s;ired, and what He had promi&s;ed; and bade him &startq;to
think of the be&s;t Way of doing it.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Chancellor was one of tho&s;e, who would have been glad that the
Act had not been clogged with many of tho&s;e Clau&s;es, which He fore&s;aw
might produce &s;ome Inconveniences; but when it was pa&s;&s;ed, He thought
it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ee Obedience paid to it without any Connivance:
And therefore, as He had always di&s;&s;uaded the King from giving &s;o much
<MILESTONE N="30">Countenance to tho&s;e Applications, which He always knew publi&s;hed more
to be &s;aid than in Truth was ever &s;poken, and was the more troubled for
this Progre&s;s They had made with the King; He told his Maje&s;ty, &startq; that
it was not in his Power to pre&s;erve tho&s;e Men, who did not &s;ubmit to
do all that was to be done by the Act, from Deprivation.&endq; He gave
many Rea&s;ons which occurred, why &startq;&s;uch a Declaration as was de&s;ired
would prove ineffectual to the End for which it was de&s;ired, and what Incon|veniences
would re&s;ult from attempting it.&endq; His Maje&s;ty alleged many
Rea&s;ons for the doing it, which He had received from tho&s;e who de&s;ired it,
and &s;eemed &s;orry that they were no better; however concluded, &startq;that He
<MILESTONE N="40">had engaged his Word, and that He would perform what He had pro|mi&s;ed;&endq;
and required him not to oppo&s;e it. The Chancellor had always
been very tender of his Honour; and advi&s;ed him &startq;to be very wary in
making any Promi&s;e, but when He had made it, to perform it though
to his Di&s;advantage:&endq; And it was no new Thing to him, to be reproached
for oppo&s;ing the re&s;olving to do &s;uch or &s;uch a Thing, and then to be re|proached
again for pur&s;uing the Re&s;olution.</P>
<P>THE King was at <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> and &s;ent for the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Can|terbury,</HI>
the Bi&s;hops of <HI>London</HI> and of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> to attend him, with the
Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Bridgman,</HI> and the Attorney General: There were likewi&s;e
<MILESTONE N="50">the Chancellor, the General, the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and the Secretaries.
His Maje&s;ty acquainted them with &startq;the Importunities u&s;ed by the <HI>London</HI>
Mini&s;ters, and the Rea&s;ons They had offered why a further Time &s;hould
be given to them to con&s;ider of what was &s;o new to them; and what
<PB N="160" REF="167">
An&s;wer He had given to them; and how They had renewed their Im|portunity
with a De&s;ire of &s;uch a Declaration from him as is mentioned
before, in which He thought there was no Inconvenience, and therefore
had promi&s;ed to do it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He endeavours to fulfil his Promi&s;e.</NOTE> and called them now together to advi&s;e of the be&s;t
Way of doing it.&endq; The Bi&s;hops were very much troubled, that tho&s;e
Fellows &s;hould &s;till pre&s;ume to give his Maje&s;ty &s;o much Vexation, and that
They &s;hould have &s;uch Acce&s;s to him. They gave &s;uch Arguments again&s;t
the doing what was de&s;ired, as could not be an&s;wered; and for them&s;elves,
They de&s;ired &startq;to be excu&s;ed for not conniving in any Degree at the
Breach of the Act of Parliament, either by not pre&s;enting a Clerk where<MILESTONE N="10">
them&s;elves were Patrons, or deferring to give In&s;titution upon the Pre&s;en|tation
of others: And that his Maje&s;ty's giving &s;uch a Declaration or Re|commendation
would be the greate&s;t Wound to the Church, and to the
Government thereof, that it could receive.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Chancellor, who did really believe that the King and his Service
would &s;uffer more by the Breach of his Word and Promi&s;e, than either
could do from doing the Thing de&s;ired, confe&s;&s;ed &startq;that He believed it
would do them little Good, which would not be imputed to his Maje&s;ty,
when He had done all He could do; and that it would be a greater
Conformity, if the Mini&s;ters generally performed what They offered<MILESTONE N="20">
to do, in reading all the Service of the Church, than had been the&s;e
many Years; and that once having done what was known to be &s;o con|trary
to their Inclinations, would be an Engagement upon them in a
&s;hort Time to comply with the re&s;t of their Obligations: And therefore,&endq;
He &s;aid, &startq;He &s;hould not di&s;&s;uade his Maje&s;ty from doing what He had
promi&s;ed;&endq; which indeed He had good Rea&s;on to think He was re&s;olved
to do, whatever He was advi&s;ed to the contrary. The King demanded the
Judgment of the Lawyers, &startq;whether He could legally di&s;pen&s;e with the
Ob&s;ervation of the Act for three Months;&endq;<NOTE PLACE="marg">But finds it not in his Power.</NOTE> who an&s;wered, &startq;that notwith|&s;tanding
any Thing He could do in their Favour, the Patrons might pre|&s;ent<MILESTONE N="30">
their Clerk as if the Incumbents were dead, upon their Not-perform|ance
of what They were enjoined.&endq; Upon the whole Matter the King
was converted; and with great Bitterne&s;s again&s;t that People in general, and
again&s;t the particular Per&s;ons whom He had always received too graciou&s;ly,
concluded that He would not do what was de&s;ired, and that the Connivance
&s;hould not be given to any of them.</P>
<P>THE Bi&s;hops departed full of Satisfaction with the King's Re&s;olution, and
as un&s;atisfied with their Friend the Chancellor's Inclination to gratify that
People, not knowing the Engagement that was upon him. And this Jea|lou&s;y
produced a greater Coldne&s;s from &s;ome of them towards him, and<MILESTONE N="40">
a greater Re&s;entment from him, who thought He had de&s;erved better
from their Function and their Per&s;ons, than was in a long Time, if ever,
perfectly reconciled. Yet He never declined in the lea&s;t Degree his Zeal
for the Government of the Church, or the Intere&s;t of tho&s;e Per&s;ons; nor
thought They could be blamed for their Severity again&s;t tho&s;e Mini&s;ters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great Di&s;|ingenuity of the Presby|terian Mi|ni&s;ters.</NOTE>
who were &s;urely the proude&s;t Malefactors, and the mo&s;t incapable of being
gently treated, of any Men living. For if any of the Bi&s;hops u&s;ed them
kindly, and endeavoured to per&s;uade them to Conformity, They reported
&startq;that They had been care&s;&s;ed and flattered by the Bi&s;hops, and offered great
Preferments, which They had bravely refu&s;ed to accept for the Pre&s;ervation<MILESTONE N="50">
of a good Con&s;cience:&endq; And in Reports of this Kind, few of them ever
ob&s;erved any Rules of Ingenuity or Sincerity.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="168">
WHEN They &s;aw that They were to expect and undergo the wor&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They endea|vour to rai&s;e Di&s;contents in the People.</NOTE>
They agreed upon a Method to be ob&s;erved by them in the leaving and
parting with their Pulpits: And the la&s;t Sunday They were to preach,
They endeavoured to infu&s;e Murmur, Jealou&s;y and Sedition into the Hearts
of their &s;everal Auditories; and to prepare them &startq;to expect and bear with
Patience and Courage all the Per&s;ecutions which were like to follow, now
the Light of the Go&s;pel was &s;o near being extingui&s;hed.&endq; And all tho&s;e
Sermons They called their Farewel Sermons, and cau&s;ed to be printed toge|ther,
with every one of the Preachers Pictures before their Sermons; which
<MILESTONE N="10">in Truth contained all the Vanity and O&s;tentation with Reference to them|&s;elves,
and all the In&s;inuations to Mutiny and Rebellion, that could be
warily couched in Words which could not be brought within Penalty of
Law, though their Meaning was well under&s;tood.</P>
<P>WHEN the Time was expired, better Men were put into their Churches,
though with much murmuring of &s;ome of their Pari&s;hes for a Time, in|crea&s;ed
by their loud Clamour, &startq;that They had been betrayed by the
King's Promi&s;e that They &s;hould have three Months longer Time:&endq;
Which drew the like Clamour upon them by tho&s;e, who had hearkened to
their Advice in continuing their Ob&s;tinacy in Confidence of a Di&s;pen&s;ation;
<MILESTONE N="20">whereas otherwi&s;e They would have conformed, as very many of their Party
did. And many of the other who were cozened by them, and &s;o lo&s;t the
Livings They had, made all the Ha&s;te They could to make them&s;elves
capable of getting others, by as full Sub&s;criptions and Conformity as the
<HI>Act of Uniformity</HI> required.<NOTE PLACE="marg">At length mo&s;t of them con|form.</NOTE> And the greate&s;t of them, after &s;ome Time,
and after They found that the private Bounty and Donatives, which at fir&s;t
flowed in upon them in Compa&s;&s;ion of their Sufferings and to keep up
their Courages, every Day begun to &s;lacken, and would in the End expire,
&s;ub&s;cribed to tho&s;e very Declarations, which They had urged as the greate&s;t
Motives to their Nonconformity. And the Number was very &s;mall, and
<MILESTONE N="30">of very weak and incon&s;iderable Men, that continued refractory, and re|ceived
no Charge in the Church: Though it may without Breach of Cha|rity
be believed, that many who did &s;ub&s;cribe had the &s;ame Malignity to
the Church, and to the Government of it; and it may be did more Harm,
than if They had continued in their Inconformity.</P>
<P>THE long Time &s;pent in Both Hou&s;es upon the <HI>Act of Uniformity</HI> had
made the Progre&s;s of all other publick Bu&s;ine&s;s much the flower;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Animo|&s;ities in Par|liament about private Bills.</NOTE> or rather,
the Multitude of private Bills which depended there (and with which former
Parliaments had been very rarely troubled), and the Bitterne&s;s and Animo|&s;ities
which aro&s;e from thence, exceedingly di&s;quieted and di&s;compo&s;ed the
<MILESTONE N="40">Hou&s;e; every Man being &s;o much concerned for the Intere&s;t of his Friends
or Allies, that He was more &s;olicitous for the Di&s;patch of tho&s;e, than of
any which related to the King and the Publick, which He knew would by
a general Concurrence be all pa&s;&s;ed before the Se&s;&s;ion &s;hould be made;
whereas if the other &s;hould be deferred, the Se&s;&s;ion would quickly follow
(which the King by frequent Me&s;&s;ages de&s;ired to ha&s;ten, having received
News already of the Queen's having being at Sea many Days), and the Be|nefit
of tho&s;e Pretences would be lo&s;t, and with greater Difficulty be reco|vered
in a &s;ucceeding Se&s;&s;ion. Then as tho&s;e private Bills were for the par|ticular
Benefit and Advantage of &s;ome Per&s;ons, which engaged all their
<MILESTONE N="50">Friends to be very &s;olicitous for their Di&s;patch; &s;o for the mo&s;t Part they
were to the Lo&s;s and Damage of other Per&s;ons, who likewi&s;e called in Aid
of all their Friends to prevent the Hou&s;es Con&s;ent: And by this Means &s;o
many Factions were kindled in Both Hou&s;es, between tho&s;e who drove on
<PB N="162" REF="169">
the Intere&s;t of their own or of their Relations, who mutually looked upon
one another as Enemies, and again&s;t tho&s;e who for Ju&s;tice and the Dignity of
Parliament would have rejected all or mo&s;t of the Addre&s;&s;es of that Kind;
that in mo&s;t Debates which related to neither, the Cu&s;tom of Contradic|tion,
and the Aver&s;ion to Per&s;ons, very much di&s;turbed and prolonged all
Di&s;patch.</P>
<P>IT cannot be denied, that after a civil War of &s;o many Years, pro&s;e|cuted
with that Height of Malice and Revenge, &s;o many Hou&s;es plun|dered
and &s;o many burned, in which the Evidences of many E&s;tates
were totally de&s;troyed, and as many by the un&s;kilful Providence of others,<MILESTONE N="10">
who in Order to pre&s;erve them had buried their Writings &s;o unwarily un|der
Ground, that they were taken up &s;o defaced or rotted, that they could
not be pleaded in any Court of Ju&s;tice; many who had followed the King
in the War, and &s;o made them&s;elves liable to tho&s;e Penalties which the
Parliament had prepared for them and &s;ubjected them to, had made many
feigned Conveyances, with &s;uch Limitations and &s;o ab&s;olutely (that no Tru&s;t
might be di&s;covered by tho&s;e who had Power to avoid it) that they were in|deed
too ab&s;olute to be avoided by them&s;elves, and their E&s;tates become
&s;o much out of their own Di&s;po&s;al, that They could neither apply them to
the Payment of their ju&s;t Debts, or to the Provi&s;ion for their Children: I<MILESTONE N="20">
&s;ay, there were many &s;uch Ca&s;es, which could be no other Way provided
for but by an Act of Parliament, and to which an Act of Parliament with|out
too much Severity and Rigour could not be denied. And again&s;t any
of tho&s;e there appeared none or very little Oppo&s;ition to be made.</P>
<P>BUT the Example and Precedent of &s;uch drew with them a World of un|rea&s;onable
Pretences; and They, who were not in a Condition to receive
Relief in any Court of Ju&s;tice, thought They had a Ground to appeal to
Parliament. They who had been compelled, for rai&s;ing the Money They
were forced to pay for their Delinquency, to &s;ell Land, and could not
fell it but at a very low Value (for it was one Species of the Oppre&s;&s;ion of<MILESTONE N="30">
that Time, that when a powerful Man had an A&s;pect upon the Land of
any Man who was to compound, and &s;o in View like to fell it, no other
Man would offer any Money for it, &s;o that He was &s;ure at la&s;t to have it
upon his own Price); now all that mon&s;trous Power was vani&s;hed, They
who had made tho&s;e unthri&s;ty Bargains and Sales, though with all the For|malities
of Law, by Fines and Recoveries and the like (which is all the Secu|rity
that can be given upon a Purcha&s;e), e&s;pecially if the Purcha&s;er was of
an ill Name, came with all imaginable Confidence to the Parliament, to
have their Land re&s;tored to them. Every Man had rai&s;ed an Equity in his
own Imagination, that He thought ought to prevail again&s;t any De&s;cent,<MILESTONE N="40">
Te&s;tament or Act of Law; and that whatever any Man had been brought
to do, which common Rea&s;on would make manife&s;t that He would never
have done if He could have cho&s;en, was Argument &s;ufficient of &s;uch a
Force, and ought to find Relief in Parliament, from the unbounded Equity
They were Ma&s;ters of and could di&s;pen&s;e, whatever Formalities of Law had
preceded or accompanied the Tran&s;action. And whoever oppo&s;ed tho&s;e
extravagant Notions, which &s;ometimes deprived Men of the Benefit of the
<HI>Act of Oblivion,</HI> was thought to be without Ju&s;tice, or which to them was
wor&s;e, to be without any Kindne&s;s to the King's Party. And without
Que&s;tion, upon tho&s;e Motives or others as unrea&s;onable, many Acts were<MILESTONE N="50">
pa&s;&s;ed of very ill Example, and which many Men were &s;candalized at in
the pre&s;ent, and Po&s;terity will more cen&s;ure hereafter, when Infants who
were then unborn &s;hall find them&s;elves di&s;inherited of tho&s;e E&s;tates, which
<PB N="163" REF="170">
their Ance&s;tors had carefully provided &s;hould de&s;cend to them; upon
which Irregularities the King made Reflection when He made the Se&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e Incongruities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment proceed$ with great Duty towards the King.</NOTE> and the Indi&s;po&s;itions which
attended them, They performed all tho&s;e Re&s;pects towards the King, which
He did or could expect from them; there being &s;carce a Man, who op|po&s;ed
the granting any Thing that was propo&s;ed for the Benefit of his Ma|je&s;ty,
or the Greatne&s;s of the Crown: And though &s;ome of the Particulars
mentioned before did &s;ometimes intervene, to hinder and defer the pre&s;ent
Re&s;olutions and Conclu&s;ions in tho&s;e Coun&s;els, the Re&s;olutions and Conclu|&s;ions
<MILESTONE N="10">in a &s;hort Time after &s;ucceeded according to the King's Wi&s;h. The
Militia and many other Regalities were declared and &s;ettled according to the
original Sen&s;e of the Law, and the Authority of the Crown vindicated to the
Height it had been at upon the Heads of the greate&s;t Kings who had ever
reigned in the Nation. Monies were rai&s;ed by &s;everal Bills, &s;ufficient as
They conceived to have paid all the Debts the King or the Kingdom owed;
for in their Computations They comprehended the Debts that were owing
before his Maje&s;ty's Return, and for which the publick Faith had been en|gaged:
And if as much had been paid as They conceived They had given,
probably it might have been enough to have di&s;charged all tho&s;e. They
<MILESTONE N="20">&s;ettled a con&s;tant Revenue upon the Crown, which according to the E&s;ti|mate
They made would amount to the yearly Revenue of twelve hundred
thou&s;and Pounds, a Proportion double to what it was in the Reign of
Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and it may be of any King preceding; and declared,
&startq;that if it did not amount to that full Value, They would &s;upply it at
another Meeting.&endq; And though it hath not in Truth amounted to that
Sum in his Maje&s;ty's Receipts, the Parliament hath imputed it rather to ill
Managery, and letting Farms at too ea&s;y Rates, than to an Error in their
Computation. For the pre&s;ent, it was looked upon by the King and by
his Mini&s;ters as an&s;werable to his Expectation. And &s;o, upon Notice of the
<MILESTONE N="30">Queen's being upon the Coa&s;t, and afterwards of her Arrival at <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI>
the King appointed the Hou&s;es to pre&s;ent all their Bills to him upon the nine|teenth
of <HI>May</HI> for his Royal A&s;&s;ent, it being few Days above a Year from
the Time of their being fir&s;t convened.</P>
<P>WHEN the King came to the Parliament, and They had pre&s;ented the
great Number of Bills which They had prepared, and after He had given
his Royal A&s;&s;ent to mo&s;t of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Speech to the Parliament.</NOTE> his Maje&s;ty told them, &startq;that He thought
there had been very few Se&s;&s;ions of Parliament, in which there had been
&s;o many Bills, as He had pa&s;&s;ed that Day: He was confident, never &s;o
many private Bills, which He hoped They would not draw into Exam|ple.
<MILESTONE N="40">It was true,&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;the late ill Times had driven Men into
great Streights, and might have obliged them to make Conveyances
colourably, to avoid Inconveniences, and yet not afterwards to be avoided;
and Men had gotten E&s;tates by new and greater Frauds than had been
heretofore practi&s;ed; and therefore in this Conjuncture extraordinary
Remedies might be nece&s;&s;ary, which had induced him to comply with
their Advice in pa&s;&s;ing tho&s;e Bills; but He prayed them that this &s;hould
be rarely done hereafter: That the good old Rules of the Law are the be&s;t
Security;&endq; and He wi&s;hed &startq;that Men might not have too much Cau&s;e
to fear, that the Settlements which They make of their E&s;tates &s;hall be
<MILESTONE N="50">too ea&s;ily un&s;ettled when They are dead by the Power of Parliament.&endq;</P>
<P>HE &s;aid, &startq;They had too much obliged him, not only in the Matter of
tho&s;e Bills which concerned his Revenue, but in the Manner of pa&s;&s;ing
them, with &s;o great Affection and Kindne&s;s, that He knew not how to
<PB N="164" REF="171">
thank them enough. He did a&s;&s;ure them, and prayed them to a&s;&s;ure
their Friends in the Country, that He would apply all that They had
given to him, to the utmo&s;t Improvement of the Peace and Happine&s;s of
the Kingdom; and that He would, with the be&s;t Advice and good Hu&s;|bandry
He could, bring his own Expen&s;es within a narrower Compa&s;s.&endq;
And He &s;aid, &startq;now He was &s;peaking to them of his own good Hu&s;bandry,
He mu&s;t tell them, that would not be enough; He could not but ob|&s;erve,
that the whole Nation &s;eemed to him a little corrupted in their
Exce&s;s of Living. All Men &s;pend much more in their Cloaths, in their
Diet, in all their Expen&s;es, than They had u&s;ed to do. He hoped it<MILESTONE N="10">
had only been the Exce&s;s of Joy after &s;o long Sufferings, that had tran|&s;ported
him and them to tho&s;e other Exce&s;&s;es; but,&endq; He de&s;ired them,
that They might all take Heed that the Continuance of them did not
indeed corrupt their Natures. He did believe that He had been that
Way very faulty him&s;elf: He promi&s;ed that He would reform, and that
if They would join with him in their &s;everal Capacities, They would by
their Examples do more Good both in City and Country, than any new
Laws would do.&endq; He &s;aid many other good Things that plea&s;ed them,
and no Doubt He intended all He &s;aid; but the Ways and Expedients to|wards
good Hu&s;bandry were no where pur&s;ued.<MILESTONE N="20"></P>
<P>THE Chancellor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel|lor's Speech.</NOTE> by the King's Command, enlarged upon &startq;the general
Murmurs upon the Expen&s;e, and that it &s;hould &s;o much exceed all
former Times.&endq; He put them in Mind, &startq;how the Crown had been
u&s;ed &s;ince tho&s;e Times, how the King had found it at his ble&s;&s;ed Return:
That as &s;oon as He came hither, be&s;ides the infinite Sums that He for|gave,
He gave more Money to the People than He had &s;ince received
from them&endq; (He meant I &s;uppo&s;e the Relea&s;e of all the Rents, Debts and
Receipts which were due to him); &startq;that at lea&s;t two Parts of three that They
had &s;ince given him had i&s;&s;ued for the di&s;banding of Armies never rai&s;ed
by him, and for Payment of Fleets never &s;ent out by him, and of Debts<MILESTONE N="30">
never incurred by him.&endq; He put them in Mind &startq;of the va&s;t Di&s;parity
between the former Times and the&s;e in which They now lived, and con|&s;equently
of the Di&s;proportion in the Expen&s;e the Crown was now at, for
the Protection and Benefit of the Subject, to what it formerly underwent.
How great a Difference there was in the pre&s;ent Greatne&s;s and Power of
the two Crowns, and what they had been then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, was evident
to all Men; and if the Greatne&s;s and Power of the Crown of <HI>England</HI>
&s;hould not be in &s;ome Proportion improved too, it might be liable to In|conveniencies
it would not undergo alone. How our Neighbours and our
Rivals, who court one and the &s;ame Mi&s;tre&s;s, Trade and Commerce,<MILESTONE N="40">
with all the World, are advanced in Shipping, Power, and an immode|rate
De&s;ire to engro&s;s the whole Traffick of the Univer&s;e, was notorious
enough; and that this unruly Appetite would not be re&s;trained or di&s;ap|pointed,
nor the Trade of the Nation be &s;upported and maintained, with
the &s;ame Fleets and Forces which had been maintained in the happy
Times of Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> He needed not &s;peak of the naval Power
of the <HI>Turks,</HI> who in&s;tead of &s;culking abroad in poor &s;ingle Ships as They
were wont to do, domineer now on the Ocean in &s;trong Fleets, make
naval Fights, and had brought &s;ome <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> to a better Corre&s;pondence,
and another Kind of Commerce and Traffick with them, than was ex|pected&endq;<MILESTONE N="50">
(for at that Time the <HI>Dutch</HI> had made a low and di&s;honourable
Peace with the Pirates of <HI>Algiers</HI> and <HI>Tunis</HI>): &startq;In&s;omuch as They appre|hend
no Enemy upon the Sea, but what They find in the King of
<PB N="165" REF="172">
<HI>England's</HI> Ships, which had indeed brought no &s;mall Damage upon
them, with no &s;mall Charge to the King, but a great Reputation to the
Nation.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;HE did a&s;&s;ure them, that the Charge the Crown was then at, by Sea
and Land, for the Peace and Security and Wealth and Honour of the
Nation, amounted to no le&s;s than eight hundred thou&s;and Pounds in
the Year; all which did not co&s;t the Crown before the late Troubles
four&s;core thou&s;and Pounds the Year: And therefore that Nobody could
blame them for any Supply They had given, or Addition They had
<MILESTONE N="10">made to the Revenue of the Crown.&endq; He told them, &startq;that the new
Acqui&s;itions of <HI>Dunkirk, Mardike, Tangier, Jamaica,</HI> and <HI>Bombayne,</HI>
ought to be looked upon as Jewels of an immen&s;e Magnitude in the
Royal Diadem; and though they were of pre&s;ent Expen&s;e, they were like
in a &s;hort Time, with God's Ble&s;&s;ing, to bring va&s;t Advantages to the
Trade, Navigation, Wealth and Honour of the King and Kingdom. His
Maje&s;ty had enough expre&s;&s;ed his De&s;ire to live in a perfect Peace and
Amity with all his Neigbours; nor was it an ill Ingredient towards the
Firmne&s;s and Stability of that Peace and Amity which his Royal An|ce&s;tors
had held with them, that He hath &s;ome Advantages in Ca&s;e of a
<MILESTONE N="20">War,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment pro|rogued.</NOTE> which They were without.&endq; The &s;ame Day the Parliament was
prorogued to the eighteenth Day of <HI>February</HI> following.</P>
<P>IT was about the End of <HI>May,</HI> when the Queen came to <HI>Hampton-Court.</HI>
The Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> after He had reduced tho&s;e of <HI>Algiers</HI> and <HI>Tunis</HI> to
good Conditions, went to <HI>Tangier,</HI> which was to be delivered to him
before He was to go to <HI>Li&s;bon</HI> for the Reception of the Queen:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Sandwich <HI>takes Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of</HI> Tangier.</NOTE> And deli|vered
to him it was, though by an Accident that might have cau&s;ed it to
be delivered into another Hand. There was never the lea&s;t Doubt, but that
the Queen Regent did re&s;olve religiou&s;ly to perform all the Conditions on
the Part of <HI>Portugal;</HI> and the Government was yet in her Hands. But the
<MILESTONE N="30">King growing towards his Majority, and of a Nature not like to comply
long with his Mother's Advice; Factions began likewi&s;e to grow in that
Court. The Delivery of <HI>Tangier,</HI> and into the Hands of Hereticks, was
much murmured at; as like more to irritate the Pope, who did already
carry him&s;elf towards them very unlike a common Father, notwith&s;tanding
the powerful Interpo&s;ition of <HI>France,</HI> which, upon the Peace lately made
between the two Crowns, was already cea&s;ed: So that They now appre|hended,
that this new Provocation would give &s;ome Excu&s;e to the Court of
<HI>Rome,</HI> to comply more &s;everely with the Importunities from <HI>Spain,</HI> which
likewi&s;e upon this Occa&s;ion They were &s;ure would be renewed with all po&s;|&s;ible
<MILESTONE N="40">In&s;tance. And though the Queen had lately &s;ent a Governour to
<HI>Tangier,</HI> whom She therefore made Choice of, as a Man devoted to her,
and who would obey her Commands in the Delivery of this Place; yet it
is certain, He went thither with a contrary Re&s;olution.</P>
<P>VERY few Days before the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> came thither,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A De&s;ign of not giving it up to him.</NOTE> the Governour
marched out with all the Hor&s;e and above Half the Foot of the Garri&s;on
into the Country, and fell into an Ambu&s;h of the <HI>Moors,</HI> who being
much more numerous cut off the whole Party: And &s;o the Governour
with &s;o many of the chief Officers and Soldiers being killed, the Town
was left &s;o weak, that if the <HI>Moors</HI> had pur&s;ued their Advantage with
<MILESTONE N="50">&s;uch Numbers as They might, and did intend within few Days to bring
with them, They would have been able to have made little Re&s;i&s;tance.
And the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> coming happily thither in that Conjuncture, it
was delivered into his Hands, who convoyed the Remainder of the Gar|ri&s;on
<PB N="166" REF="173">
into <HI>Portugal,</HI> where They were like to be &s;toned by the People;
and then, having put a good Garri&s;on of Hor&s;e and Foot which were &s;ent
from <HI>England</HI> into it, He delivered it up to the Earl of <HI>Peterborough,</HI> who
had a Commi&s;&s;ion from the King to be Governour thereof; and him&s;elf
with the Fleet failed to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> where He had been long expected, and
found his Hou&s;e and Equipage ready, He being then to appear in the Qua|lity
of Extraordinary Amba&s;&s;adour to demand the Queen.</P>
<P>HIS Arrival there happened likewi&s;e in a very happy Conjuncture;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He comes to</HI> Lisbon <HI>in a critical Con|juncture.</HI></NOTE> for
the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Army, &s;tronger than it had been before, was upon its March
to be&s;iege a Seaport Town, which lay &s;o near <HI>Lisbon,</HI> that being in the<MILESTONE N="10">
Enemies Hands it would very much have infe&s;ted their whole Trade, and was
not &s;trong enough long to have re&s;i&s;ted &s;o powerful an Enemy. But upon
the Fame of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet's Arrival, the <HI>Spaniard</HI> gave over that De|&s;ign,
and retired: Since as it was impo&s;&s;ible that They &s;hould be able to
take that Place, which the Fleet was &s;o ready to relieve; &s;o They knew
not but that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> might make a De&s;cent into their own Quarters,
which kept them from engaging before any other Town. But the Alarum
the March of that Army had given had &s;o much di&s;turbed <HI>Portugal,</HI> which
never keep their whole Forces on Foot, but draw them together upon &s;uch
emergent Occa&s;ions; that They were compelled to make U&s;e of mo&s;t of<MILESTONE N="20">
that Money, which They &s;aid had been laid up and &s;hould be kept for the
Payment of the Queen's Portion, which was to be tran&s;ported with her
into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>WHEREUPON, after the Amba&s;&s;adour had been received with all po&s;&s;ible
Demon&s;tration of Re&s;pect and publick Joy, and had had his &s;olemn Au|dience
from the King and from the Queen Regent and the Queen his
Mi&s;tre&s;s; and &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentlemen of Quality, who were &s;ent by the
King, were admitted to tho&s;e Places of Attendance about the Queen, to
which his Maje&s;ty had a&s;&s;igned them: The Queen Mother with infinite
Apologies told the Amba&s;&s;adour,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Portu|gue&s;e <HI>not able to pay the Queen's Por|tion.</HI></NOTE> &startq;that the Streights and Poverty of the<MILESTONE N="30">
Kingdom were &s;o great upon the late Advance of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Army, that
there could at this pre&s;ent be only paid one Half of the Queen's Portion,
and that the other Half &s;hould infallibly be paid within a Year, with
which She hoped the King her Brother would be &s;atisfied; and that for
the better doing it, She re&s;olved to &s;end back the &s;ame Amba&s;&s;adour,
who had brought &s;o good a Work with God's Ble&s;&s;ing to &s;o good an
End, with her Daughter to the King.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> was much perplexed, nor did ea&s;ily re&s;olve what
He was to do. His In&s;tructions were to receive the whole Portion, which
He knew the King expected, and which They were not able to pay. He<MILESTONE N="40">
had already received <HI>Tangier,</HI> and left a &s;trong Garri&s;on in it, and had
neither Authority to re&s;tore it, nor wherewithal to carry back the Men.
And at la&s;t, after He had u&s;ed all the Means to have the Whole paid, and
was &s;o fully informed, that He did in Truth believe that They could do no
more, He re&s;olved that He would receive the Queen aboard the Fleet.
That which They were ready to deliver for Half the Portion, was not in
Money, but to be made up by Jewels, Sugar and other Commodities,
which &s;hould not be overvalued. The Amba&s;&s;adour was contented to give
his Receipt for the &s;everal Species of the Money They would deliver, leaving
the Value to be computed in <HI>England;</HI> but expre&s;&s;ly refu&s;ed to accept the<MILESTONE N="50">
Jewels, Sugar and Merchandi&s;es at any Rates or Prices; but was contented
to receive them on Board the Ships, and to deliver them <HI>in Specie</HI> at <HI>Lon|don</HI>
to any Per&s;on who &s;hould be appointed by them to receive them, who
<PB N="167" REF="174">
&s;hould be obliged to pay the Money they were valued at, and to make up
the whole Sum that &s;hould be paid to the King for the Moiety. In Con|clu&s;ion,
all Things were delivered on Board the Ships; and <HI>Diego Silvas,</HI> a
Jew of great Wealth and full Credit at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> was &s;ent with it, and
obliged to make even the Account with the King's Mini&s;ters at <HI>London,</HI>
and to pay what &s;hould remain due. And a new Obligation was entered
into by the Crown of <HI>Portugal,</HI> for the Payment of the other Moiety within
the Space of a Year. And the Queen with all her Court and Retinue were
embarked on Board the Fleet; and without any ill Accidents her Maje&s;ty
<MILESTONE N="10">arrived &s;afely at <HI>Port&s;mouth:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Queen arrives in</HI> England.</NOTE> And having re&s;ted only three or four Days
there, to recover the Indi&s;po&s;ition contracted in &s;o long a Voyage at Sea, her
Maje&s;ty together with the King came to <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> at the Time
mentioned before, the twenty ninth of <HI>May,</HI> the King's Birthday, full two
Years after his Maje&s;ty's Return and entering <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER the publick Joy of the Kingdom was very manife&s;t upon this
Conjunction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Endeavours u&s;ed to alienate the King's Af|fection from the Queen.</NOTE> yet in a &s;hort Time there appeared not that Serenity in the
Court that was expected. They who had formerly endeavoured to prevent
it, u&s;ed ever after all the ill Arts They could to make it di&s;agreeable, and
to alienate the King's Affection from the Queen to &s;uch a Degree, that it
<MILESTONE N="20">might never be in her Power to prevail with him to their Di&s;advantage; an
Effect They had Rea&s;on to expect from any notable Intere&s;t She might gain
in his Affections, &s;ince She could not be uninformed by the Amba&s;&s;adour
of the Di&s;&s;ervice They had formerly endeavoured to do her.</P>
<P>THERE was a Lady of Youth and Beauty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some Circum|&s;tances that contribute to|wards a Mi&s;|under&s;tanding between them.</NOTE> with whom the King had lived in
great and notorious Familiarity from the Time of his Coming into <HI>England,</HI>
and who, at the Time of the Queen's Coming or a little before, had been de|livered
of a Son whom the King owned. And as that Amour had been gene|rally
taken Notice of, to the le&s;&s;ening of the good Reputation the King had
with the People; &s;o it underwent the le&s;s Reproach from the King's being
<MILESTONE N="30">young, vigorous, and in his full Strength; and upon a full Pre&s;umption that
when He &s;hould be married, He would contain him&s;elf within the &s;trict
Bounds of Virtue and Con&s;cience. And that his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf had that
firm Re&s;olution, there want not many Arguments, as well from the excel|lent
Temper and Ju&s;tice of his own Nature, as from the Profe&s;&s;ions He had
made with &s;ome Solemnity to Per&s;ons who were believed to have much
Credit, and who had not failed to do their Duty, in putting him in Mind
&startq;of the infinite Obligations He had to God Almighty, and that He ex|pected
another Kind of Return from him, in the Purity of Mind and In|tegrity
of Life:&endq; Of which his Maje&s;ty was piou&s;ly &s;en&s;ible, albeit there
<MILESTONE N="40">was all po&s;&s;ible Pains taken by that Company which were admitted to his
Hours of Plea&s;ure, to divert and corrupt all tho&s;e Impre&s;&s;ions and Princi|ples,
which his own Con&s;cience and reverent E&s;teem of Providence did &s;ug|ge&s;t
to him; turning all Di&s;cour&s;e and Mention of Religion into Ridicule,
as if it were only an Invention of Divines to impo&s;e upon Men of Parts,
and to re&s;train them from the Liberty and U&s;e of tho&s;e Faculties which God
and Nature had given them, that They might be &s;ubject to their Reproofs
and Determinations; which Kind of Licen&s;e was not grateful to the King,
and therefore warily and accidentally u&s;ed by tho&s;e who had plea&s;ant Wit,
and in who&s;e Company He took too much Delight.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50">THE Queen had Beauty and Wit enough to make her&s;elf very agreeable to
him; and it is very certain, that at their fir&s;t Meeting and for &s;ome Time af|ter
the King had very good Satisfaction in her, and without Doubt made very
good Re&s;olutions within him&s;elf, and promi&s;ed him&s;elf a happy and an innocent
<PB N="168" REF="175">
Life in her Company, without any &s;uch Uxoriou&s;ne&s;s, as might draw the
Reputation upon him of being governed by his Wife, of which He had ob|&s;erved
or been too largely informed of &s;ome inconvenient Effects in the
Fortune of &s;ome of his neare&s;t Friends, and had long prote&s;ted again&s;t
&s;uch a Re&s;ignation; though They who knew him well, did not think him
&s;o much &s;uperiour to &s;uch a Conde&s;cen&s;ion, but that if the Queen had
had that Craft and Addre&s;s and Dexterity that &s;ome former Queens had,
She might have prevailed as far by Degrees as They had done. But the
Truth is, though She was of Years enough to have had more Experience of
the World, and of as much Wit as could be wi&s;hed, and of a Humour very<MILESTONE N="10">
agreeable at &s;ome Sea&s;ons; yet She had been bred, according to the Mode
and Di&s;cipline of her Country, in a Mona&s;tery, where She had only &s;een the
Women who attended her, and conver&s;ed with the Religious who re&s;ided
there, and without Doubt in her Inclinations was enough di&s;po&s;ed to have
been one of that Number. And from this Re&s;traint She was called out to
be a great Queen, and to a free Conver&s;ation in a Court that was to be
upon the Matter new formed, and reduced from the Manners of a licentious
Age to the old Rules and Limits which had been ob&s;erved in better Times;
and to which regular and decent Conformity the pre&s;ent Di&s;po&s;ition of Men
or Women was not enough inclined to &s;ubmit, nor the King enough di&s;|po&s;ed<MILESTONE N="20">
to exact.</P>
<P>THERE was a numerous Family of Men and Women that were &s;ent
from <HI>Portugal,</HI> the mo&s;t improper to promote that Conformity in the
Queen that was nece&s;&s;ary for her Condition and future Happine&s;s, that could
be cho&s;en: The Women for the mo&s;t Part old and ugly and proud, inca|pable
of any Conver&s;ation with Per&s;ons of Quality and a liberal Education.
And They de&s;ired and indeed had con&s;pired &s;o far to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Queen
them&s;elves, that She &s;hould neither learn the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Language, nor u&s;e
their Habit, nor depart from the Manners and Fa&s;hions of her own Country
in any Particulars; &startq;which Re&s;olution&endq; They told her &startq;would be for the<MILESTONE N="30">
Dignity of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and would quickly induce the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ladies to
conform to her Maje&s;ty's Practice:&endq; And this Imagination had made that
Impre&s;&s;ion, that the Taylor who had been &s;ent into <HI>Portugal</HI> to make her
Cloaths, could never be admitted to &s;ee her or receive any Employ|ment.
Nor when She came to <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> and found there &s;everal La|dies
of Honour and prime Quality to attend her in the Places to which
They were a&s;&s;igned by the King, did She receive any of them, till the
King him&s;elf came; nor then with any Grace, or the Liberty that belonged
to their Places and Offices. She could not be per&s;uaded to be dre&s;&s;ed out
of the Wardrobe that the King had &s;ent to her, but would wear the<MILESTONE N="40">
Cloaths which She had brought, until She found that the King was di&s;|plea&s;ed,
and would be obeyed: Whereupon She conformed again&s;t the
Advice of her Women, who continued their Opiniatrety, without any
one of them receding from their own Mode, which expo&s;ed them the more
to Reproach.</P>
<P>WHEN the Queen came to <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> She brought with her a formed
Re&s;olution, that She would never &s;uffer the Lady who was &s;o much &s;poken of
to be in her Pre&s;ence: And afterwards to tho&s;e She would tru&s;t She &s;aid,
&startq;her Mother had enjoined her &s;o to do.&endq; On the other Hand, the King
thought that He had &s;o well prepared her to give her a civil Reception,<MILESTONE N="50">
that within a Day or two after her Maje&s;ty's being there, him&s;elf led her
into her Chamber, and pre&s;ented her to the Queen, who received her
with the &s;ame Grace as She had done the re&s;t; there being many Lords
<PB N="169" REF="176">
and other Ladies at the &s;ame Time there. But whether her Maje&s;ty in the
In&s;tant knew who She was, or upon Recollection found it afterwards, She
was no &s;ooner &s;ate in her Chair, but her Colour changed, and Tears gu&s;hed
out of her Eyes, and her No&s;e bled, and She fainted; &s;o that She was
forthwith removed into another Room, and all the Company retired out of
that where She was before. And this falling out &s;o notoriou&s;ly when &s;o
many Per&s;ons were pre&s;ent, the King looked upon it with wonderful Indig|nation,
and as an Earne&s;t of Defiance for the Deci&s;ion of the Supremacy
and who &s;hould govern, upon which Point He was the mo&s;t jealous and
<MILESTONE N="10">the mo&s;t re&s;olute of any Man; and the An&s;wer He received from the
Queen, which kept up the Ob&s;tinacy, di&s;plea&s;ed him more. Now the
Breach of the Conditions grew Matter of Reproach; the Payment of but
Half the Portion was objected to the Amba&s;&s;adour, who would have been
very glad that the Quarrel had been upon no other Point. He knew not
what to &s;ay or do; the King being offended with him for having &s;aid &s;o
much in <HI>Portugal</HI> to provoke the Queen, and not in&s;tructed her enough to
make her unconcerned in what had been before her Time, and in which
She could not rea&s;onably be concerned; and the Queen with more Indigna|tion
reproaching him with the Character He had given of the King, of his
<MILESTONE N="20">Virtue and good Nature: Whil&s;t the poor Man, not able to endure the
Tempe&s;t of &s;o much Inju&s;tice from Both, thought it be&s;t to &s;atisfy Both by
dying; and from the extreme Affliction of Mind which He underwent, He
&s;u&s;tained &s;uch a Fever as brought him to the Brink of his Grave, till
&s;ome Grace from Both their Maje&s;ties contributed much to the Recovery of
his Spirits.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time the King forbore her Maje&s;ty's Company, and &s;ought
Ea&s;e and Refre&s;hment in that jolly Company, to which in the Evenings
He grew every Day more indulgent, and in which there were &s;ome, who
de&s;ired rather to inflame than pacify his Di&s;content. And They found an
<MILESTONE N="30">Expedient to vindicate his Royal Juri&s;diction, and to make it manife&s;t to
the World, that He would not be governed; which could never without much
Artifice have got Entrance into his Princely Brea&s;t, which always entertained
the mo&s;t tender Affections; nor was ever any Man's Nature more remote
from Thoughts of Roughne&s;s or Hardheartedne&s;s. They magnified the Tem|per
and Con&s;titution of his Grandfather, who indeed to all other Purpo&s;es
was a glorious Example: &startq;That when He was enamoured, and found a
Return an&s;werable to his Merit, He did not di&s;&s;emble his Pa&s;&s;ion, nor
&s;uffered it to be Matter of Reproach to the Per&s;ons whom He loved; but
made all others pay them that Re&s;pect which He thought them worthy
<MILESTONE N="40">of; brought them to the Court, and obliged his own Wife the Queen to
treat them with Grace and Favour; gave them the highe&s;t Titles of Ho|nour,
to draw Reverence and Application to them from all the Court and
all the Kingdom; rai&s;ed the Children He had by them to the Reputa|tion,
State and Degree of Princes of the Blood, and conferred Fortunes
and Offices upon them accordingly. That his Maje&s;ty, who inherited
the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ions, was without the Gratitude and noble Inclination to
make Returns proportionable to the Obligations He received. That He
had, by the Charms of his Per&s;on and of his Profe&s;&s;ions, prevailed upon
the Affections and Heart of a young and beautiful Lady of a noble Ex|traction,
<MILESTONE N="50">who&s;e Father had lo&s;t his Life in the Service of the Crown.
That She had provoked the Jealou&s;y and Rage of her Hu&s;band to that
Degree, that He had &s;eparated him&s;elf from her: And now the Queen's
Indignation had made the Matter &s;o notorious to the World, that the
<PB N="170" REF="177">
di&s;con&s;olate Lady had no Place of Retreat left, but mu&s;t be made an Ob|ject
of Infamy and Contempt to all her Sex, and to the whole World.&endq;</P>
<P>THOSE Di&s;cour&s;es, together with a little Book newly printed at <HI>Paris,</HI>
according to the Licen&s;e of that Nation, of the Amours of <HI>Henry</HI> IV.
which was by them pre&s;ented to him, and too concernedly read by him,
made that Impre&s;&s;ion upon his Mind, that He re&s;olved to rai&s;e the Quality
and Degree of that Lady, who was married to a private Gentleman of a
competent Fortune, that had not the Ambition to be a better Man than
He was born. And that He might do &s;o, He made her Hu&s;band an Earl
of <HI>Ireland,</HI> who knew too well the Con&s;ideration that He paid for it, and<MILESTONE N="10">
abhorred the Brand of &s;uch a Nobility, and did not in a long Time a&s;|&s;ume
the Title. The Lady thus qualified was now made fit for higher
Preferment: And the King re&s;olved, for the Vindication of her Honour and
Innocence, that She &s;hould be admitted of the Bedchamber of the Queen,
as the only Means to convince the World, that all A&s;per&s;ions upon her had
been without Ground. The King u&s;ed all the Ways He could, by treating
the Queen with all Care&s;&s;es, to di&s;po&s;e her to gratify him in this Particular,
as a Matter in which his Honour was concerned and engaged; and prote&s;ted
unto her, which at that Time He did intend to ob&s;erve, &startq;that He had
not had the lea&s;t Familiarity with her &s;ince her Maje&s;ty's Arrival, nor<MILESTONE N="20">
would ever after be guilty of it again, but would live always with her
Maje&s;ty in all Fidelity for Con&s;cience Sake.&endq; The Queen, who was na|turally
more tran&s;ported with Choler than her Countenance declared her to
be, had not the Temper to entertain him with tho&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es, which the
Vivacity of her Wit could very plentifully have &s;ugge&s;ted to her; but brake
out into a Torrent of Rage, which increa&s;ed the former Prejudice, con|firmed
the King in the Re&s;olution He had taken, gave ill People more
Credit to mention her di&s;re&s;pectfully, and more increa&s;ed his Aver&s;ion from
her Company, and which was wor&s;e, his Delight in tho&s;e, who meant
that He &s;hould neither love his Wife or his Bu&s;ine&s;s, or any Thing but<MILESTONE N="30">
their Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>THESE dome&s;tick Indi&s;po&s;itions and Di&s;tempers, and the Impre&s;&s;ion
they made of &s;everal Kinds upon the King's Spirit and his Humour, ex|ceedingly
di&s;compo&s;ed the Minds of the grave&s;t and mo&s;t &s;erious Men;
gave the People generally Occa&s;ion of &s;peaking loudly, and with a Licen&s;e
that the Magi&s;trates knew not how to puni&s;h, for the Publication of the
Scandal: And the wi&s;e&s;t Men de&s;paired of finding Remedies to apply to the
Di&s;&s;olutene&s;s and Debauchery of the Time, which vi&s;ibly increa&s;ed. No
Man appeared to &s;uffer or likely to &s;uffer more than the Chancellor, again&s;t
whom though no particular Per&s;on owned a Malignity, the Congregation<MILESTONE N="40">
of the witty Men for the Evening Conver&s;ation were enough united again&s;t
his Intere&s;t; and thought his Influence upon the King's Actions and Coun|&s;els
would be too much augmented, if the Queen came to have any
Power, who had a very good Opinion of him: And it is very probable,
that even that Apprehen&s;ion increa&s;ed the Combination again&s;t her Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>THE Lady had Rea&s;on to hate him mortally, well knowing that there
had been an inviolable Friend&s;hip between her Father and him to his
Death, which had been notorious to all Men; and that He was an im|placable
Enemy to the Power and Intere&s;t She had with the King, and
had u&s;ed all the Endeavours He could to de&s;troy it. Yet neither She nor any<MILESTONE N="50">
of the other adventured to &s;peak ill of him to the King, who at that Time
would not have borne it; except for Wit's Sake They &s;ometimes reflected
upon &s;omewhat He had &s;aid, or acted &s;ome of his Po&s;tures and Manner of
<PB N="171" REF="178">
&s;peaking (the Skill in Mimickry being the be&s;t Faculty in Wit many of them
had); which Licen&s;e They practi&s;ed often towards the King him&s;elf, and
therefore his Maje&s;ty thought it to be the more free from Malice. But by
the&s;e Liberties, which at fir&s;t only rai&s;ed Laughter, They by Degrees got
the Hardine&s;s to cen&s;ure both the Per&s;ons, Coun&s;els and Actions, of tho&s;e
who were neare&s;t his Maje&s;ty's Tru&s;t, with the highe&s;t Malice and Pre|&s;umption;
and too often &s;u&s;pended or totally di&s;appointed &s;ome Re&s;olutions,
which had been taken upon very mature Deliberation, and which ought to
have been pur&s;ued. But (as hath been &s;aid before) this Pre&s;umption had not
<MILESTONE N="10">yet come to this Length.</P>
<P>THE King imparted the Trouble and Unquietne&s;s of his Mind to No|body
with equal Freedom, as He did to the Chancellor: To him He
complained of all the Queen's Perver&s;ene&s;s and ill Humours, and informed
him of all that pa&s;&s;ed between them, and obliged him to confer and advi&s;e
the Queen, who, He knew, looked upon him as a Man devoted to her Ser|vice,
and that He would &s;peak very confidently to her what&s;oever He
thought; and therefore gave him Leave to take Notice to her of any Thing
He had told him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel|lor endeavours to reconcile heir Maje&s;|ties.</NOTE> It was too delicate a Province for &s;o plaindealing a
Man as He was to undertake: And yet He knew not how to refu&s;e it, nor
<MILESTONE N="20">indeed did de&s;pair totally of being able to do &s;ome Good, &s;ince the Queen was
not yet more acquainted with any Man than with him, nor &s;pake &s;o much
with any Man as with him; and He believed, that He might hereby have
Opportunity to &s;peak &s;ometimes to the King of &s;ome Particulars with more
Freedom, than otherwi&s;e He could well do, at lea&s;t more effectually.</P>
<P>HE had never heard before of the Honour the King had done that Lady,
nor of the Purpo&s;e He had to make her of his Wife's Bedchamber. He
&s;pake with great Boldne&s;s to him upon Both; and did not believe that the
fir&s;t was proceeded in beyond Revocation, becau&s;e it had not come to the
Great Seal, and gave him many Arguments again&s;t it, which He thought
<MILESTONE N="30">of Weight. But upon the other Point He took more Liberty, and &s;pake
&startq;of the Hardheartedne&s;s and Cruelty in laying &s;uch a Command upon
the Queen, which Fle&s;h and Blood could not comply with.&endq; He put
him in Mind of what He heard his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf &s;ay, upon the like
Exce&s;s which a neighbour King had lately u&s;ed, in making his Mi&s;tre&s;s
to live in the Court, and in the Pre&s;ence of the Queen: That his Ma|je&s;ty
had then &s;aid, &startq;<HI>that it was &s;uch a Piece of Illnature, that He could
never be guilty of; and if ever He &s;hould be guilty of having a Mi&s;tre&s;s
after He had a Wife, which He hoped He &s;hould never be, She &s;hould
never come where his Wife was: He would never add that to the Vexation,
<MILESTONE N="40">of which She would have enough without it.</HI>&endq; And yet He told him,
&startq;that &s;uch Friend&s;hips were not new in that other Court, nor &s;candalous
in that Kingdom; whereas in this it was &s;o unheard of and &s;o odious,
that a Woman who pro&s;tituted her&s;elf to the King was equally infamous
to all Women of Honour, and mu&s;t expect the &s;ame Contempt from
them, as if She were common to Mankind: And that no Enemy He
had could advi&s;e him a more &s;ure Way to lo&s;e the Hearts and Affections
of the People, of which He was now &s;o abundantly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, than the
indulging to him&s;elf that Liberty, now it had plea&s;ed God to give him a
Wife worthy of him. That the Exce&s;s He had already u&s;ed in that
<MILESTONE N="50">and other Ways had lo&s;t him &s;ome Ground; but that the Continuance
in them would break the Hearts of all his Friends, and be only grate|ful
to tho&s;e who wi&s;hed the De&s;truction of Monarchy:&endq; And concluded
with &startq;a&s;king his Pardon for &s;peaking &s;o plainly,&endq; and be&s;ought his Ma|je&s;ty
<PB N="172" REF="179">
to remember &startq;the wonderful Things which God had done for him,
and for which He expected other Returns than He had yet received.&endq;</P>
<P>THE King heard him with Patience enough, yet with tho&s;e little Inter|ruptions
which were natural to him, e&s;pecially to that Part where He had
$evelled the Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of Kings and Princes with other lewd Women, at
which He expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome Indignation, being an Argument often debated
before him by tho&s;e, who would have them looked upon above any other
Mens Wives. He did not appear di&s;plea&s;ed with the Liberty He had taken,
but &s;aid, &startq;He knew it proceeded from the Affection He had for him;&endq; and
then proceeded upon the &s;everal Parts of what He had &s;aid, more volubly<MILESTONE N="10">
than He u&s;ed to do, as upon Points in which He was conver&s;ant, and had
heard well debated.</P>
<P>To the fir&s;t, He begun with the Story of an Accident that had fallen
out the Day before; He &s;aid, &startq;the Lady had then told him, <HI>that She did
hope that the Chancellor was not &s;o much her Enemy, as He was generally
reported to be, for She was &s;ure He was not guilty of one Di&s;courte&s;y of
which He had been accu&s;ed to her, and therefore might be as innocent in
others;</HI> and then told his Maje&s;ty, <HI>that the Day before, the Earl of</HI>
Bri&s;tol&endq; (who was never without &s;ome Rea&s;on to engage him&s;elf in &s;uch
Intrigues, and had been a principal Promoter of all tho&s;e late Re&s;olutions)<MILESTONE N="20">
&startq;<HI>came to her, and a&s;ked her whether the Patent was not yet pa&s;&s;ed; She an|&s;wered,
No; He a&s;ked if She knew the Rea&s;on, which She &s;eeming not to
do, He told her that He came in Confidence to tell her, and that if She
did not quickly curb and overrule &s;uch Pre&s;umption, She would often
meet it to her Prejudice; then told her a long Relation, how the Patent had
been carried to the Chancellor prepared for the Seal, and that He ac|cording
to his Cu&s;tom had &s;uperciliou&s;ly &s;aid, that He would fir&s;t &s;peak with
the King of it, and that in the mean Time it &s;hould not pa&s;s; and that if
She did not make the King very &s;en&s;ible of this his In&s;olence, his Maje&s;ty
&s;hould never be Judge of his own Bounty.</HI> And then the Lady laughed, and<MILESTONE N="30">
made &s;harp Reflections upon the Principles of the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI>&endq; (who
had throughout his Life the rare good Fortune of being exceedingly beloved
and exceedingly hated by the &s;ame Per&s;ons, in the Space of one Month;
and now finding that there was a Stop of the Patent, made a very natural
Gue&s;s where it mu&s;t be, and gratified his own Appetite in the Conclu&s;ion),
&startq;and pulled the Warrant out of her Pocket, <HI>where</HI> She &s;aid <HI>it had remained
ever &s;ince it was &s;igned, and She believed the Chancellor had never heard
of it: She was &s;ure there was no Patent prepared, and therefore He could
not &s;top it at the Seal.&endq;</HI></P>
<P>THE Truth is: Though according to the Cu&s;tom She had a&s;&s;umed the<MILESTONE N="40">
Title as &s;oon as She had the Warrant, that the other Pretence might be
pro&s;ecuted, She made not Ha&s;te to pa&s;s the Patent, left her Hu&s;band
might &s;top it; and after long Deliberation was not &s;o confident of the
Chancellor, as to tran&s;mit it to the Seal that was in his Cu&s;tody, but, the
Honour being <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> &s;ent it into that Kingdom to pa&s;s the Great Seal there,
where She was &s;ure it could meet no Interruption.</P>
<P>WHEN the King had made this Relation, and added &s;ome &s;harp Remarks
upon the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> as a Man very particularly known and under&s;tood
by him; He &s;aid, &startq;that He had undone this Lady, and ruined her Repu|tation,
which had been fair and untainted till her Friend&s;hip for him;<MILESTONE N="50">
and that He was obliged in Con&s;cience and Honour to repair her to the
utmo&s;t of his Power. That He would always avow to have a great
Friend&s;hip for her, which He owed as well to the Memory of her Fa|ther
<PB N="173" REF="180">
as to her own Per&s;on; and that He would look upon it as the
highe&s;t Di&s;re&s;pect to him, in any Body who &s;hould treat her otherwi&s;e
than was due to her own Birth, and the Dignity to which He had rai&s;ed
her. That He liked her Company and Conver&s;ation, from which He
would not be re&s;trained, becau&s;e He knew there was and &s;hould be all
Innocence in it: And that his Wife &s;hould never have Cau&s;e to complain
that He brake his Vows to her, if She would live towards him as a good
Wife ought to do, in rendering her&s;elf grateful and acceptable to him,
which it was in her Power to do; but if She would continue unea&s;y to
<MILESTONE N="10">him, He could not an&s;wer for him&s;elf, that He &s;hould not endeavour to
&s;eek Content in other Company. That He had proceeded &s;o far in the
Bu&s;ine&s;s that concerned the Lady, and was &s;o deeply engaged in it, that
She would not only be expo&s;ed to all imaginable Contempt, if it &s;uc|ceeded
not; but his own Honour would &s;uffer &s;o much, that He &s;hould
become ridiculous to the World, and be thought too in Pupilage under
a Governour; and therefore He would expect and exact a Confor|mity
from his Wife herein, which &s;hould be the only hard Thing
He would ever require from her, and which She her&s;elf might make
very ea&s;y, for the Lady would behave her&s;elf with all po&s;&s;ible Duty and
<MILESTONE N="20">Humility unto her, which if She &s;hould fail to do in the lea&s;t Degree,
She &s;hould never &s;ee the King's Face again: And that He would never
be engaged to put any other Servant about her, without fir&s;t con&s;ulting
with her, and receiving her Con&s;ent and Approbation. Upon the Whole,&endq;
He &s;aid, &startq;He would never recede from any Part of the Re&s;olution He
had taken and expre&s;&s;ed to him: And therefore He required him to u&s;e
all tho&s;e Arguments to the Queen, which were nece&s;&s;ary to induce her to
a full Compliance with what the King de&s;ired.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Chancellor addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the Queen with as full Liberty and
Plainne&s;s as He had pre&s;umed to u&s;e to his Maje&s;ty, but could not proceed
<MILESTONE N="30">&s;o far at a Time, nor hold &s;o long Conferences at once. When He fir&s;t
lamented the Mi&s;intelligence He ob&s;erved to be between their Maje&s;ties, and
She perceived the King had told him &s;ome Particulars, She prote&s;ted her
own Innocence, but with &s;o much Pa&s;&s;ion and &s;uch a Torrent of Tears,
that there was Nothing left for him to do, but to retire, and tell her,
&startq;that He would wait upon her in a fitter Sea&s;on, and when She &s;hould be
more capable of receiving humble Advice from her Servants, who wi&s;hed
her well;&endq; and &s;o departed.</P>
<P>THE next Day He waited upon her again at the Hour a&s;&s;igned by her,
and found her much better compo&s;ed than He had left her. She vouch|&s;a&s;ed
<MILESTONE N="40">to excu&s;e the Pa&s;&s;ion She had been in, and confe&s;&s;ed &startq;She looked
upon him as one of the few Friends She had, and from whom She would
mo&s;t willingly at all Times receive Coun&s;el: But that She hoped He
would not wonder or blame her, if having greater Misfortunes upon her,
and being to &s;truggle with more Difficulties, than any Woman had ever
been put to of her Condition, She &s;ometimes gave Vent to that Pa&s;&s;ion
that was ready to break her Heart.&endq; He told her, &startq;He was de&s;irous in|deed
to &s;erve her, of which He would not make great or many Prote&s;|tations,
&s;ince She could not but believe it, except She thought him to be
a Fool or mad, &s;ince Nothing could contribute &s;o much to his Happi|ne&s;s,
<MILESTONE N="50">as an eminent Sympathy between the King and her in all Things:
And He could not give her a greater Evidence of his Devotion, than in
always &s;aying that to her which was fit for her to hear, though it did
<PB N="174" REF="181">
not plea&s;e her; and He would ob&s;erve no other Rule towards her,
though it &s;hould render him ungracious to her.&endq;</P>
<P>SHE &s;eemed well &s;atisfied with what He &s;aid, and told him &startq;He &s;hould
never be more welcome to her, than when He told her of her Faults:&endq;
To which He replied, &startq;that it was the Province He was accu&s;ed of u&s;urping
with Reference to all his Friends.&endq; He told her, &startq;that He doubted She
was little beholden to her Education, that had given her no better In|formation
of the Follies and Iniquities of Mankind, of which He pre|&s;umed
the Climate from whence She came could have given more In|&s;tances,
than this cold Region would afford;&endq; though at that Time it was<MILESTONE N="10">
indeed very hot. He &s;aid, &startq;if her Maje&s;ty had been fairly dealt with in
that Particular, She could never have thought her&s;elf &s;o mi&s;erable, and her
Condition &s;o in&s;upportable as She &s;eemed to think it to be; the Ground
of which heavy Complaint He could not comprehend.&endq; Whereupon with
&s;ome blu&s;hing and Confu&s;ion and &s;ome Tears She &s;aid, &startq;She did not think
that She &s;hould have found the King engaged in his Affection to another
Lady;&endq; and then was able to &s;ay no more: Which gave the Chan|cellor
Opportunity to &s;ay, &startq;that He knew well, that She had been very
little acquainted with or informed of the World; yet He could not be|lieve
that She was &s;o utterly ignorant, as to expect that the King her Hu&s;|band,<MILESTONE N="20">
in the full Strength and Vigour of his Youth, was of &s;o innocent a
Con&s;titution, as to be re&s;erved for her whom He had never &s;een, and to
have had no Acquaintance or Familiarity with the Sex;&endq; and a&s;ked &startq;whether
She believed, when it &s;hould plea&s;e God to &s;end a Queen to <HI>Portugal,</HI> She
&s;hould find that Court &s;o full of cha&s;te Affection.&endq; Upon which her
Maje&s;ty &s;miled, and &s;pake plea&s;antly enough, but as if She thought it did
not concern her Ca&s;e, and as if the King's Affection had not wandered, but
remained fixed.</P>
<P>UPON which the Chancellor replied with &s;ome Warmth, &startq;that He
came to her with a Me&s;&s;age from the King, which if She received as<MILESTONE N="30">
She ought to do and as He hoped She would, She would be the happie&s;t
Queen in the World. That whatever Corre&s;pondencies the King had en|tertained
with any other Ladies, before He &s;aw her Maje&s;ty, concerned
not her; nor ought She to enquire more into them or after them, than
into what other Exce&s;&s;es He had u&s;ed in his Youth in <HI>France, Holland</HI>
or <HI>Germany.</HI> That He had Authority to a&s;&s;ure her, that all former Ap|petites
were expired, and that He dedicated him&s;elf entirely and without
Re&s;erve to her; and that if She met his Affection with that Warmth and
Spirit and good Humour, which She well knew how to expre&s;s, She
would live a Life of the greate&s;t Delight imaginable. That her good<MILESTONE N="40">
Fortune, and all the Joy She could have in this World, was in her own
Power, and that She only &s;trove to drive it from her.&endq; She heard all
this with apparent Plea&s;ure, and infinite Expre&s;&s;ions of her Acknowledg|ments
of the King's Bounty; thanked the Chancellor more than enough,
and de&s;ired him &startq;to help in returning her Thanks to his Maje&s;ty, and in
obtaining his Pardon for any Pa&s;&s;ion or Peevi&s;hne&s;s She might have been
guilty of, and in a&s;&s;uring him of all future Obedience and Duty.&endq;</P>
<P>UPON this good Temper He approached to the other Part of his Me&s;&s;age,
&startq;how nece&s;&s;ary it would be that her Maje&s;ty &s;hould gratify this good Re|&s;olution
and Ju&s;tice and Tenderne&s;s in the King, by meeting it with a<MILESTONE N="50">
proportionable Submi&s;&s;ion and Re&s;ignation on her Part to what&s;oever his
Maje&s;ty &s;hould de&s;ire of her;&endq; and then in&s;inuated what would be accept|able
with Reference to the Lady. But this was no &s;ooner mentioned, than
<PB N="175" REF="182">
it rai&s;ed all the Rage and Fury of Ye&s;terday, with fewer Tears, the Fire
appearing in her Eyes, where the Water was. She &s;aid, &startq;that the King's
in&s;i&s;ting upon that Particular could proceed from no other Ground but his
Hatred of her Per&s;on, and to expo&s;e her to the Contempt of the World,
who would think her worthy of &s;uch an Affront, if She &s;ubmitted to
it; which before She would do, She would put her&s;elf on Board any
little Ve&s;&s;el, and &s;o be tran&s;ported to <HI>Li&s;bon:</HI>&endq; With many other extra|vagant
Expre&s;&s;ions, which her Pa&s;&s;ion &s;ugge&s;ted in Spite of her Under|&s;tanding;
and which He interrupted with a very ill Countenance, and told
<MILESTONE N="10">her &startq;that She had not the Di&s;po&s;al of her own Per&s;on, nor could go out
of the Hou&s;e where She was without the King's Leave;&endq; and therefore ad|vi&s;ed
her &startq;not to &s;peak any more of <HI>Portugal,</HI> where there were enough who
would wi&s;h her to be.&endq; He told her, &startq;that He would find &s;ome fitter
Time to &s;peak with her, and till then only de&s;ired that She would make
Shew of no &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ion to the King; and that whatever She thought
fit to deny that the King propo&s;ed to her, She &s;hould deny in &s;uch
a Manner, as &s;hould look rather like a Deferring than an utter Re|fu&s;al,
that his Maje&s;ty might not be provoked to enter into the &s;ame
Pa&s;&s;ion, which would be &s;uperiour to hers.&endq;</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20">THE Chancellor made the more Ha&s;te to inform the King of all that
had pa&s;&s;ed, that He might prevail with him to &s;u&s;pend for &s;ome little Time
the pro&s;ecuting that Argument farther with the Queen. He gave him an
Account of all the good and kind Things She had &s;aid with Reference to
his Maje&s;ty, of the Profe&s;&s;ions She had made of all Duty and Obedience to
him throughout the whole Cour&s;e of her Life; &startq;that her Unwillingne&s;s to
obey him in this one Particular proceeded only from the great Pa&s;&s;ion of
Love which She had for him, that tran&s;ported her beyond the Limits of
her Rea&s;on.&endq; He confe&s;&s;ed, &startq;He had not di&s;cour&s;ed it &s;o fully with
her Maje&s;ty as He re&s;olved to have done, becau&s;e a &s;udden Pa&s;&s;ion had
<MILESTONE N="30">&s;eized upon her, which She mu&s;t have &s;ome Time to overrule;&endq; and
therefore He entreated his Maje&s;ty &startq;for a Day or two to forbear pre&s;&s;ing
the Queen in that Matter, till He had once more waited upon her, by
which He hoped He might in &s;ome Degree di&s;po&s;e her Maje&s;ty to give
him Satisfaction.&endq; And though He was in no Degree plea&s;ed with the
Account, yet the other did think, that He would for a little have re&s;pited
the farther Di&s;cour&s;e of it.</P>
<P>BUT the King quickly found other Coun&s;ellors, who told him, &startq;that
the Thing He contended for was not of &s;o much Importance as the Man|ner
of obtaining it; that the Contention now was, who &s;hould govern;
<MILESTONE N="40">and if He &s;uffered him&s;elf to be di&s;puted with, He mu&s;t re&s;olve hereafter
to do all Things <HI>precari&ograve;.</HI>&endq; And as this Advice was more &s;uitable to
his pre&s;ent Pa&s;&s;ion and Purpo&s;e, &s;o it was embraced greedily and re&s;olutely.
The Fire flamed that Night higher than ever: The King reproached the
Queen with Stubbornne&s;s and Want of Duty, and She him with Tyranny
and Want of Affection; He u&s;ed Threats and Menaces, which He never
intended to put in Execution, and She talked loudly &startq;how ill She was
treated, and that She would return again to <HI>Portugal.</HI>&endq; He replied,
that She &s;hould do well fir&s;t to know whether her Mother would receive
her: And He would give her a fit Opportunity to know that, by &s;ending
<MILESTONE N="50">to their Home all her <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Servants; and that He would forthwith
give Order for the Di&s;charge of them all, &s;ince They behaved them&s;elves
&s;o ill, for to them and their Coun&s;els He imputed all her Perver&s;ene&s;s.&endq;</P>

have in Affairs of &s;uch a Nature, that the King would exact an entire
Conformity to his Plea&s;ure in this Particular; and then the Que&s;tion
would only be, whether it would be better that She conform her&s;elf with
Alacrity to an Obedience, with tho&s;e Circum&s;tances which might be
obliging and meritorious on her Part; or that it &s;hould be done with|out
her Con&s;ent, and with all the Repugnancy She could expre&s;s, which
could only be in angry Words and ungracious Circum&s;tances, which
would have a more bitter Operation in her own Brea&s;t and Thoughts,
than any where el&s;e: And therefore He did very importunately advi&s;e
her to &s;ubmit to that cheerfully, that She could not re&s;i&s;t; which if She<MILESTONE N="10">
&s;hould not do, and do out of Hand, She would too late repent.&endq;</P>
<P>To which She replied with great Calmne&s;s, &startq;that it may be wor&s;e
could not fall out than She expected; but why She &s;hould repent the
not giving her Con&s;ent, She could not apprehend, &s;ince her Con&s;cience
would not give her Leave to con&s;ent:&endq; Which when She &s;aw him receive
with a Face of Trouble and Wonder, which it was his Misfortune and
Weakne&s;s never to be able to conceal or di&s;&s;emble, She continued her Di&s;|cour&s;e
and &s;aid, &startq;She could not conceive how any Body could, with a
good Con&s;cience, con&s;ent to what She could not but &s;uppo&s;e would be an
Occa&s;ion and Opportunity of Sin.&endq; To which He &s;uddenly replied, &startq;that<MILESTONE N="20">
He now under&s;tood her; and that She ought to have no &s;uch Apprehen|&s;ion,
but to believe the Profe&s;&s;ions the King made, of the Sincerity
whereof She would hereby become a Witne&s;s; and if there &s;hould be any
Tergiver&s;ation, the Opportunity, which She fancied, would be more fre|quent
at a Di&s;tance than by &s;uch a Relation, which Nothing but a re|&s;olved
Innocence could make de&s;irable by either Party.&endq; To which He
added, &startq;that He thought her Maje&s;ty had too mean and low an Opinion
of her Per&s;on and her Parts, if She thought it could be in the Power
of any other Lady to deprive her of the Intere&s;t She had a Right to,
if She did all that became her to retain it; and which in that Ca&s;e<MILESTONE N="30">
She could not lo&s;e but by the highe&s;t Fraud and Perjury, which She could
not ju&s;tly entertain the Su&s;picion of.&endq;</P>
<P>THERE cannot be a greater Patience and Intentne&s;s of hearing, than the
Queen manife&s;ted during the Time of his Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;ometimes &s;eeming
not di&s;plea&s;ed, but oftener by a Smile declaring that She did not believe
what He &s;aid: And in Conclu&s;ion, in few Words declared, &startq;that the
King might do what He plea&s;ed, but that She would not con&s;ent to it;&endq;
and pronounced it with a Countenance, as if She both hoped and believed,
that her Ob&s;tinacy would in the End prevail over the King's Importunity:
And it is very probable, that She had Advice given her to that Purpo&s;e.<MILESTONE N="40">
The Chancellor concluded with telling her, &startq;that He would give her no
more Trouble upon this Particular: That He was &s;orry He had not
Credit enough to prevail with her Maje&s;ty in a Point that would have
turned &s;o much to her Benefit; and that She would hereafter be &s;orry
for her Refu&s;al.&endq; And when He had given the King a faithful Account
of all that had pa&s;&s;ed; and &startq;that He believed them Both to be very much
to blame, and that that Party would be mo&s;t excu&s;able who yielded
fir&s;t;&endq; He made it his humble Suit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Endea|vours prove un&s;ucce&s;sful.</NOTE> &startq;that He might be no more con|&s;ulted
with, nor employed in an Affair in which He had been &s;o un|&s;ucce&s;sful.&endq;</P>
<P>THE King came &s;eldom into the Queen's Company, and when He did<MILESTONE N="50">
He &s;pake not to her; but &s;pent his Time in other Diverti&s;ements, and
in the Company of tho&s;e who made it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to laugh at all the
<PB N="179" REF="184">
World, and who were as bold with God Almighty as with any of his
Creatures. He per&s;evered in all his Re&s;olutions without any Remor&s;e; di|rected
a Day for all the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> to be embarked, without a&s;&s;igning any
con&s;iderable Thing of Bounty to any of them, or vouch&s;afing to write any
Letter to the King or Queen of <HI>Portugal</HI> of the Cau&s;e of the Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of
them. And this Rigour prevailed upon the great Heart of the Queen, who
had not received any Money to enable her to be liberal to any of tho&s;e,
who had attended her out of their own Country, and promi&s;ed them&s;elves
Places of great Advantage in her Family: And She earne&s;tly de&s;ired the
<MILESTONE N="10">King, &startq;that She might retain &s;ome few of tho&s;e who were known to her,
and of mo&s;t U&s;e, that She might not be wholly left in the Hands of Stran|gers;&endq;
and employed others to make the &s;ame Suit to the King on her
Behalf. Whereupon the Counte&s;s of <HI>Penalva,</HI> who had been bred with her
from a Child, and who, by the Infirmity of her Eyes and other Indi&s;po|&s;ition
of Health, &s;carce &s;tirred out of her Chamber, was permitted to remain
in the Court: And &s;ome few inferiour Servants in her Kitchen and in the
lowe&s;t Offices, be&s;ides tho&s;e who were nece&s;&s;ary to her Devotions, were left
here. All the re&s;t were tran&s;ported to <HI>Portugal.</HI></P>
<P>THE Officers of the Revenue were required to u&s;e all Strictne&s;s in the
<MILESTONE N="20">Receipt of that Part of the Portion that was brought over with the Fleet;
and not to allow any of tho&s;e Demands which were made upon Computa|tion
of the Value of Money, and other Allowances, upon the Account:
And <HI>Diego de Silva,</HI> who was de&s;igned in <HI>Portugal</HI> without any good Rea|&s;on
to be the Queen's Trea&s;urer, and upon that Expectation had undertaken
that trouble&s;ome Province to &s;ee the Money paid in <HI>London</HI> by what was
a&s;&s;igned to that Purpo&s;e, was committed to Pri&s;on for not making Ha&s;te
enough in the Payment and in fini&s;hing the Account; and his Commit|ment
went very near the Queen, as an Affront done to her&s;elf. The <HI>Por|tugal</HI>
Amba&s;&s;adour, who was a very hone&s;t Man, and &s;o de&s;irous to &s;erve
<MILESTONE N="30">the King that He had upon the Matter lo&s;t the Queen, was heartbroken;
and after a long Sickne&s;s, which all Men believed would have killed him,
as &s;oon as He was able to endure the Air, left <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> and re|tired
to his own Hou&s;e in the City.</P>
<P>IN all this Time the King pur&s;ued his Point; the Lady came to
the Court, was lodged there, was every Day in the Queen's Pre&s;ence,
and the King in continual Conference with her; whil&s;t the Queen
fate untaken Notice of: And if her Maje&s;ty ro&s;e at the Indignity and
retired into her Chamber, it may be one or two attended her, but all
the Company remained in the Room She left, and too often &s;aid tho&s;e
<MILESTONE N="40">Things aloud which Nobody ought to have whi&s;pered. The King
(who had in the Beginning of this Conflict appeared &s;till with a Countenance
of Trouble and Sadne&s;s, which had been manife&s;t to every Body, and
no Doubt was really afflicted, and &s;ometimes wi&s;hed that He had not pro|ceeded
&s;o far, until He was again new chafed with the Reproach of being
governed, which He received with the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Indignation, and was
commonly provoked with it mo&s;t by tho&s;e who intended mo&s;t to govern
him) had now vanqui&s;hed or &s;uppre&s;&s;ed all tho&s;e Tenderne&s;&s;es and Re|luctancies,
and appeared every Day more gay and plea&s;ant, without any
Clouds in his Face, and full of good Humour; &s;aving that the clo&s;e
<MILESTONE N="50">Ob&s;ervers thought it more feigned and affected than of a natural Growth.
However to the Queen it appeared very real, and made her the more &s;en|&s;ible,
that She alone was left out in all Jollities, and not &s;uffered to have
any Part of tho&s;e plea&s;ant Applications and Care&s;&s;es, which She &s;aw made
<PB N="180" REF="185">
almo&s;t to every Body el&s;e; an univer&s;al Mirth in all Company but in hers,
and in all Places but in her Chamber; her own Servants &s;hewing more Re&s;|pect
and more Diligence to the Per&s;on of the Lady, than towards their
own Mi&s;tre&s;s, who They found could do them le&s;s Good. The nightly
Meeting continued with the &s;ame or more Licen&s;e; and the Di&s;cour&s;es which
pa&s;&s;ed there, of what Argument &s;oever, were the Di&s;cour&s;e of the whole
Court and of the Town the Day following: Whil&s;t the Queen had the
King's Company tho&s;e few Hours which remained of the preceding Night,
and which were too little for Sleep.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e Mortifications were too heavy to be borne: So that at<MILESTONE N="10">
la&s;t, when it was lea&s;t expected or &s;u&s;pected, the Queen on a &s;udden
let her&s;elf fall fir&s;t to Conver&s;ation and then to Familiarity, and even
in the &s;ame In&s;tant to a Confidence with the Lady; was merry with
her in publick, talked kindly of her, and in private u&s;ed Nobody
more friendly. This Exce&s;s of Conde&s;cen&s;ion, without any Provoca|tion
or Invitation, except by Multiplication of Injuries and Neglect,
and after all Friend&s;hips were renewed, and Indulgence yielded to new
Liberty, did the Queen le&s;s Good than her former Re&s;olutene&s;s had done.
Very many looked upon her with much Compa&s;&s;ion, commended the
Greatne&s;s of her Spirit, dete&s;ted the Barbarity of the Affronts She under|went,<MILESTONE N="20">
and cen&s;ured them as loudly as They dur&s;t; not without a&s;&s;uming
the Liberty &s;ometimes of in&s;inuating to the King him&s;elf, &startq;how much
his own Honour &s;uffered in the Neglect and Di&s;re&s;pect of her own
Servants, who ought at lea&s;t in publick to manife&s;t &s;ome Duty and
Reverence towards her Maje&s;ty; and how much He lo&s;t in the general
Affections of his Subjects: And that, be&s;ides the Di&s;plea&s;ure of God Al|mighty,
He could not rea&s;onably hope for Children by the Queen, which
was the great if not the only Ble&s;&s;ing of which He &s;tood in Need, whil&s;t
her Heart was &s;o full of Grief, and whil&s;t She was continually exerci&s;ed
with &s;uch in&s;upportable Afflictions.&endq; And many, who were not wholly<MILESTONE N="30">
unconver&s;ant with the King, nor Strangers to his Temper and Con&s;titution,
did believe that He grew weary of the Struggle, and even ready to avoid
the Scandal that was &s;o notorious, by the Lady's withdrawing from the
Verge of the Court and being no longer &s;een there, how firmly &s;oever the
Friend&s;hip might be e&s;tabli&s;hed. But this &s;udden Downfal and total abandoning
her own Greatne&s;s, this low Demeanour and even Application to a Per&s;on
She had ju&s;tly abhorred and worthily contemned, made all Men conclude,
that it was a hard Matter to know her, and con&s;equently to &s;erve her. And
the King him&s;elf was &s;o far from being reconciled by it, that the E&s;teem,
which He could not hitherto but retain in his Heart for her, grew now<MILESTONE N="40">
much le&s;s. He concluded that all her former Aver&s;ion expre&s;&s;ed in tho&s;e
lively Pa&s;&s;ions, which &s;eemed not capable of Di&s;&s;imulation, was all Fiction,
and purely acted to the Life by a Nature crafty, perver&s;e and incon|&s;tant.
He congratulated his own illnatured Per&s;everance, by which He had
di&s;covered how He was to behave him&s;elf hereafter, and what Remedies
He was to apply to all future Indi&s;po&s;itions: Nor had He ever after the
&s;ame Value of her Wit, Judgment and Under&s;tanding, which He had for|merly;
and was well enough plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that the Reverence others
had for all three was &s;omewhat dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>THE Parliament a&s;&s;embled together at the &s;ame Time in <HI>February</HI> to<MILESTONE N="50">
which They had been adjourned or prorogued, and continued together
till the End of <HI>July</HI> following.<NOTE PLACE="marg">$span$</NOTE> They brought the &s;ame Affection and Duty
with them towards the King, which They had formerly; but were much
<PB N="181" REF="186">
troubled at what They had heard and what They had ob&s;erved of the Di|vi&s;ions
in Court. They had the &s;ame Fidelity for the King's Service, but
not the &s;ame Alacrity in it: The Di&s;patch was much flower in all Matters
depending, than it had u&s;ed to be. The Truth is; the Hou&s;e of Commons
was upon the Matter not the &s;ame: Three Years &s;itting, for it was very near
&s;o long &s;ince They had been fir&s;t a&s;&s;embled, had con&s;umed very many of
their Members; and in the Places of tho&s;e who died, great Pains were
taken to have &s;ome of the King's menial Servants cho&s;en; &s;o that there
was a very great Number of Men in all Stations in the Court, as well be|low
<MILESTONE N="10">Stairs as above, who were Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons. And
there were very few of them, who did not think them&s;elves qualified to re|form
what&s;oever was ami&s;s in Church or State, and to procure what&s;oever
Supply the King would require.</P>
<P>THEY, who either out of their own Mode&s;ty, or in Regard of their di&s;tant
Relation to his Service, had &s;eldom had Acce&s;s to his Pre&s;ence, never had
pre&s;umed to &s;peak to him; now by the Privilege of Parliament every Day
re&s;orted to him, and had as much Conference with him as They de&s;ired.
They, according to the Comprehen&s;ion They had of Affairs, repre&s;ented
their Advice to him for the conducting his Affairs; according to their
<MILESTONE N="20">&s;everal Opinions and Ob&s;ervations repre&s;ented tho&s;e and tho&s;e Men as well
affected to his Service, and others, much better than They, who did not
pay them &s;o much Re&s;pect, to be ill affected and to want Duty for his
Maje&s;ty. They brought tho&s;e, who appeared to them to be mo&s;t zealous
for his Service, becau&s;e They profe&s;&s;ed to be ready to do any Thing He
plea&s;ed to pre&s;cribe, to receive his Maje&s;ty's Thanks, and from him&s;elf his
immediate Directions how to behave them&s;elves in the Hou&s;e; when the
Men were capable of no other In&s;truction, than to follow the Example of
&s;ome di&s;creet Man in what&s;oever He &s;hould vote, and behave them&s;elves
accordingly.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30">To this Time, the King had been content to refer the Conduct of his
Affairs in the Parliament to the Chancellor and the Trea&s;urer; who had every
Day Conference with &s;ome &s;elect Per&s;ons of the Hou&s;e of Commons, who
had always &s;erved the King, and upon that Account had great Intere&s;t in
that A&s;&s;embly, and in Regard of the Experience They had and their good
Parts were hearkened to with Reverence. And with tho&s;e They con&s;ulted
in what Method to proceed in di&s;po&s;ing the Hou&s;e, &s;ometimes to propo&s;e
&s;ometimes to con&s;ent to what &s;hould be mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for the Publick; and by
them to a&s;&s;ign Parts to other Men, whom They found di&s;po&s;ed and willing
to concur in what was to be de&s;ired: And all this without any Noi&s;e, or
<MILESTONE N="40">bringing many together to de&s;ign, which ever was and ever will be ingrateful
to Parliaments, and however it may &s;ucceed for a little Time, will in the
End be attended with Prejudice.</P>
<P>BUT there were two Per&s;ons now introduced to act upon that Stage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Characters of two leading Men in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons.</NOTE> who
di&s;dained to receive Orders, or to have any Method pre&s;cribed to them;
who took upon them to judge of other Mens Defects, and thought their
own Abilities beyond Exception.</P>
<P>THE one was Sir <HI>Harry Bennet,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Sir</HI> Henry Bennet.</NOTE> who had procured him&s;elf to be &s;ent
Agent or Envoy into <HI>Spain,</HI> as &s;oon as the King came from <HI>Bru&s;&s;els;</HI>
being a Man very well known to the King, and for his plea&s;ant and agree|able
<MILESTONE N="50">Humour acceptable to him: And He remained there at much Ea&s;e
till the King returned to <HI>England,</HI> having waited upon his Maje&s;ty at <HI>Fuen|tarabia</HI>
in the Clo&s;e of the Treaty between the two Crowns, and there
appeared by his Dexterity to have gained good Credit in the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI>
<PB N="182" REF="187">
and particularly with <HI>Don Lewis de Haro;</HI> and by that &s;hort Negotiation
He renewed and confirmed the former good Inclinations of his Ma&s;ter to
him. He had been obliged always to corre&s;pond with the Chancellor, by
whom his In&s;tructions had been drawn, and to receive the King's Plea&s;ure
by his Signification; which He had always done, and profe&s;&s;ed much Re|&s;pect
and Submi&s;&s;ion to him: Though whatever Orders He received, and how
po&s;itive &s;oever, in Particulars which highly concerned the King's Honour and
Dignity, He ob&s;erved them &s;o far and no farther than his own Humour di&s;|po&s;ed
him; and in &s;ome Ca&s;es flatly di&s;obeyed what the King enjoined, and
did directly the contrary, as in the Ca&s;e of the <HI>Je&s;uit Peter Talbot;</HI> who having<MILESTONE N="10">
carried him&s;elf with notorious In&s;olence towards the King in <HI>Flanders,</HI> had
tran&s;ported him&s;elf into <HI>England,</HI> offered his Service to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and after
his Death was employed by the ruling Powers into <HI>Spain,</HI> upon his under|taking
to procure Orders, by which the King &s;hould not be &s;uffered longer to
re&s;ide in <HI>Flanders;</HI> of all which his Maje&s;ty having received full Adverti&s;e|ment,
He made Ha&s;te to &s;end Orders into <HI>Spain</HI> to Sir <HI>Harry Bennet,</HI> &startq;that
He &s;hould prepare <HI>Don Lewis</HI> for his Reception by letting him know, that
though that <HI>Je&s;uit</HI> was his natural Subject, He had &s;o mi&s;behaved him&s;elf,
that He looked upon him as a mo&s;t inveterate Enemy and a Traitor; and
therefore his Maje&s;ty de&s;ired, that He might receive no Countenance there,<MILESTONE N="20">
being as He well knew &s;ent by the greate&s;t Rebels to do him Prejudice.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS was received by Sir <HI>Harry Bennet</HI> before the Arrival of the Man,
who found no Inconvenience by it; and in&s;tead of making any Complaint
concerning him, He writ Word, &startq;that <HI>Talbot</HI> had more Credit than He in
that Court, that He profe&s;&s;ed to have great Devotion for the King; and
therefore his Advice was, that the King would have a better Opinion of
him, and employ him in his Service:&endq; And him&s;elf received him into his
full Confidence, and con&s;ulted with no Man &s;o much as with him; which
made all Men believe that He was a <HI>Roman Catholick,</HI> who did believe that
He had any Religion. But He had made his full Excu&s;e and Defence for<MILESTONE N="30">
all this at the Interview at <HI>Fuentarabia,</HI> from whence the King returned
with marvellous Satisfaction in his Di&s;cretion as well as in his Affection.
And until, contrary to all his Expectation, He heard of the King's Return
into <HI>England,</HI> all his Thoughts were employed how to make Benefit of the
Duke of <HI>York's</HI> coming into <HI>Spain</HI> to be Admiral of the Gallies; which He
writ to ha&s;ten all that might be.</P>
<P>THOUGH He continued his formal Corre&s;pondence with the Chancellor,
which He could not decline; yet He held a more &s;ecret Intelligence with
<HI>Daniel O Neile</HI> of the Bedchamber, with whom He had a long Friend&s;hip.
As &s;oon as the King arrived in <HI>England,</HI> He tru&s;ted <HI>O Neile</HI> to procure any<MILESTONE N="40">
Direction from the King immediately in tho&s;e Particulars which him&s;elf ad|vi&s;ed.
And &s;o He obtained the King's Con&s;ent, for his con&s;enting to the
old League that had been made between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> in the Time
of the late King, and which <HI>Spain</HI> had expre&s;sly refu&s;ed to renew after the
Death of that King (which was &s;uddenly proclaimed in <HI>Spain,</HI> without ever
being con&s;ulted in <HI>England</HI>); and pre&s;ently after Leave to return into
<HI>England</HI> without any Letter of Revocation: Both which were procured
or rather &s;ignified by <HI>O Neile,</HI> without the Privity of the Chancellor or
of either of the Secretaries of State; nor did either of them know that
He was from <HI>Madrid,</HI> till They heard He was in <HI>Paris,</HI> from whence He<MILESTONE N="50">
arrived in <HI>London</HI> in a very &s;hort Time after. So far the Chancellor was
from that powerful Intere&s;t or Influence, when his Credit was at highe&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="188">
BUT He was very well received by the King, in who&s;e Affections He
had a very good Place: And &s;hortly after his Arrival, though not &s;o &s;oon
as He thought his high Merit de&s;erved, his Maje&s;ty conferred the only Place
then void (and that had been long promi&s;ed to a noble Per&s;on, who had
behaved him&s;elf very well towards his Maje&s;ty and his ble&s;&s;ed Father) upon
him, which was the Office of Privy Pur&s;e; received him into great Fami|liarity,
and into the nightly Meeting, in which He filled a principal Place
to all Intents and Purpo&s;es. The King very much de&s;ired to have him elected
a Member in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and commanded the Chancellor to u&s;e
<MILESTONE N="10">his Credit to obtain it upon the fir&s;t Opportunity: And in Obedience to
that Command, He did procure him to be cho&s;en about the Time we are
now &s;peaking of, when the Parliament a&s;&s;embled in <HI>February.</HI></P>
<P>THE other Per&s;on was Mr. <HI>William Coventry,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Mr.</HI> Wil|liam Coven|try.</NOTE> the younge&s;t Son to a
very wi&s;e Father, the Lord <HI>Coventry,</HI> who had been Lord Keeper of the
Great Seal of <HI>England</HI> for many Years with an univer&s;al Reputation. This
Gentleman was young whil&s;t the War continued: Yet He had put him&s;elf
before the End of it into the Army, and had the Command of a Foot
Company, and &s;hortly after travelled into <HI>France;</HI> where He remained whil&s;t
there was any Hope of getting another Army for the King, or that either
<MILESTONE N="20">of the other Crowns would engage in his Quarrel. But when all Thoughts
of that were de&s;perate, He returned into <HI>England:</HI> Where He remained for
many Years without the lea&s;t Corre&s;pondence with any of his Friends beyond
the Seas, and with &s;o little Reputation of caring much for the King's Re|&s;toration,
that &s;ome of his own Family, who were mo&s;t zealous for his
Maje&s;ty's Service, and had always &s;ome &s;ignal Part in any rea&s;onable De|&s;ign,
took Care of Nothing more, than that Nothing They did &s;hould come
to his Knowledge; and gave the &s;ame Advice to tho&s;e about the King, with
whom They corre&s;ponded, to u&s;e the &s;ame Caution. Not that any Body
&s;u&s;pected his being inclined to the Rebels, or to do any Act of Treachery;
<MILESTONE N="30">but that the Pride and Cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s of his Nature made him unconver&s;able,
and his De&s;pair that any Thing could be effectually done made him incom|petent
to con&s;ult the Ways of doing it. Nor had He any Conver&s;ation with
any of the King's Party, nor They with him, till the King was proclaimed
in <HI>London;</HI> and then He came over with the re&s;t to offer his Service to his
Maje&s;ty at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and had the good Fortune to find the Duke of
<HI>York</HI> without a Secretary. For though He had a <HI>Walloon</HI> that was, in
Re&s;pect of the Languages of which He was Ma&s;ter, fit for that Function in
the Army, and had di&s;charged it very well for &s;ome Years; yet for the
Province the Duke was now to govern, having the Office of High Admiral
<MILESTONE N="40">of <HI>England,</HI> He was without any fit Per&s;on to di&s;charge the Office of Secre|tary
with any tolerable Sufficiency: So that Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> no &s;ooner offered
his Service to the Duke, but He was received into that Employment, very
honourable under &s;uch a Ma&s;ter, and in it&s;elf of the greate&s;t Profit next the
Secretaries of State, if they in that Re&s;pect be to be preferred.</P>
<P>HE had been well known to the King and Duke in <HI>France,</HI> and had a
Brother whom the King loved well and had promi&s;ed to take into his Bed|chamber,
as He &s;hortly after did, <HI>Harry Coventry,</HI> who was beloved
by every Body, which made them glad of the Preferment of the other;
whil&s;t They who knew the wor&s;t of him, yet knew him able to di&s;charge
<MILESTONE N="50">that Office, and &s;o contributed to tbe Duke's receiving him. He was
a &s;ullen, illnatured, proud Man, who&s;e Ambition had no Limits, nor
could be contained within any. His Parts were very good, if He had not
thought them better than any other Man's; and He had Diligence and In|du&s;try
<PB N="184" REF="189">
which Men of good Parts are too often without, which made
him quickly to have at lea&s;t Credit and Power enough with the Duke;
and He was without tho&s;e Vices which were too much in Reque&s;t, and
which make Men mo&s;t unfit for Bu&s;ine&s;s and the Tru&s;t that cannot be
&s;eparated from it.</P>
<P>HE had &s;ate a Member in the Hou&s;e of Commons, from the Beginning
of the Parliament, with very much Reputation of an able Man. He &s;pake
pertinently, and was always very acceptable and well heard; and was one
of tho&s;e with whom They, who were tru&s;ted by the King in conducting
his Affairs in the lower Hou&s;e, con&s;ulted very frequently; but not &s;o<MILESTONE N="10">
much, nor relied equally upon his Advice, as upon &s;ome few others who
had much more Experience, which He thought was of U&s;e only to igno|rant
and dull Men, and that Men of Sagacity could &s;ee and determine at a
little Light, and ought rather to per&s;uade and engage Men to do that
which They judged fit, than con&s;ider what them&s;elves were inclined to do:
And &s;o did not think him&s;elf to be enough valued and relied upon, and
only to be made U&s;e of to the celebrating the De&s;igns and Contrivance of
other Men, without being &s;ignal in the Managery, which He a&s;pired to be.
Nor did any Man envy him the Province, if He could indeed have governed
it, and that others who had more u&s;eful Talents would have been ruled by<MILESTONE N="20">
him. However being a Man who naturally loved Faction and Contradic|tion,
He often made Experiments how far He could prevail in the Hou&s;e,
by declining the Method that was pre&s;cribed, and propo&s;ing &s;omewhat to
the Hou&s;e that was either be&s;ide or contrary to it, and which the others
would not oppo&s;e, believing, in Regard of his Relation, that He had re|ceived
newer Directions: And then if it &s;ucceeded well (as &s;ometimes it
did), He had Argument enough to cen&s;ure and inveigh again&s;t the Chan|cellor,
for having taken &s;o ill Mea&s;ures of the Temper and Affections of the
Hou&s;e; for He did not di&s;&s;emble in his private Conver&s;ation (though his
outward Carriage was very fair) that He had no Kindne&s;s for him, which<MILESTONE N="30">
in Gratitude He ought to have had; nor had He any Thing to complain of
from him, but that He wi&s;hed well and did all He could to defend and &s;up|port
a very worthy Per&s;on, who had de&s;erved very well from the King, again&s;t
whom He manife&s;ted a great and cau&s;ele&s;s Animo&s;ity, and de&s;ired to oppre&s;s
for his own Profit, of which He had an immoderate Appetite.</P>
<P>WHEN tho&s;e two Per&s;ons, Sir <HI>Harry Bennet</HI> and Mr. <HI>Coventry,</HI> (between
whom there had been as great a League of Friend&s;hip, as can be between
two very proud Men equally illnatured) came now to &s;it together in the Hou&s;e
of Commons; though the former of them knew no more of the Con&s;titution
and Laws of <HI>England</HI> than He did of <HI>China,</HI> nor had in Truth a Care or<MILESTONE N="40">
Tenderne&s;s for Church or State, but believed <HI>France</HI> was the be&s;t Pattern in
the World; They thought They &s;hould have the greate&s;t Wrong imaginable,
if They did not entirely govern it, and if the King took his Mea&s;ures of
what &s;hould be done there from any Body but them&s;elves. They made
Friend&s;hips with &s;ome young Men, who &s;pake confidently and often, and
upon &s;ome Occa&s;ions &s;eemed to have Credit in the Hou&s;e. And upon a little
Conver&s;ation with tho&s;e Men, who being Country Gentlemen of ordinary
Condition and mean Fortunes were de&s;irous to have Intere&s;t in &s;uch a Per|&s;on
as Sir <HI>Harry Bennet,</HI> who was believed to have great Credit with the
King; He believed He under&s;tood the Hou&s;e and what was to be done<MILESTONE N="50">
there, as well as any Man in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>HE recommended tho&s;e Men to the King &startq;as Per&s;ons of &s;ublime Parts,
worthy of his Maje&s;ty's care&s;&s;ing: That He would undertake to $ix them
<PB N="185" REF="190">
to his Service; and when They were his own, He might carry what He
would in the Hou&s;e of Commons.&endq; The Men had Parts indeed and
good Affections, and often had re&s;orted to the Chancellor, received Advice
from him, and thought them&s;elves beholden to him; being at that Time
entirely governed by Sir <HI>Hugh Pollard,</HI> who was him&s;elf &s;till advi&s;ed by
the Chancellor (with whom He had a long and fa&s;t Friend&s;hip) how He
&s;hould direct his Friends, having indeed a greater Party in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons
willing to be di&s;po&s;ed of by him, than any Man that ever &s;ate there
in my Time. But now the&s;e Gentlemen had got a better Patron; the new
<MILESTONE N="10">Courtier had rai&s;ed their Value, and talked in another Dialect to them, of
Recompen&s;es and Rewards, than They had heard formerly. He carried
them to the King, and told his Maje&s;ty in their own Hearing, &startq;what Men
of Parts They were, what Services They had done for him, and how
much greater They could do:&endq; And his Maje&s;ty received and conferred
with them very graciou&s;ly, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with Promi&s;es which made
them rich already.</P>
<P>THE two Friends before mentioned agreed &s;o well between them&s;elves,
that whether They &s;pake together or apart to the King, They &s;aid always
the &s;ame Things, gave the &s;ame Information, and took Care that Both their
<MILESTONE N="20">Ma&s;ters might have the &s;ame Opinions and Judgments. They magnified
the Affections of the Hou&s;e of Commons, &startq;which were &s;o great and united,
that They would do what&s;oever his Maje&s;ty would require. That there
were many worthy and able Men, of who&s;e Wi&s;dom the Hou&s;e was &s;o
well per&s;uaded, that They commonly con&s;ented to what&s;oever They pro|po&s;ed:
And that the&s;e Men complained, <HI>that They had no Directions given
to them which Way They might be&s;t &s;erve the King; They knew not what
He de&s;ired, which when They &s;hould do, it would quickly appear how much
They were at the King's Di&s;po&s;al, and all Things which now depended long
would be hereafter di&s;patched in Half the Time.&endq;</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30">THE King wondered very much, &startq;that his Friends in the Hou&s;e were
no better informed, of which He had never heard any Complaint before,
and wi&s;hed them to &s;peak with the Chancellor:&endq; For neither of the&s;e
Men were yet arrived at the Confidence to in&s;inuate in the lea&s;t Degree
any Ill-Will or Prejudice to him, though They were not united in any
one Thing more than the De&s;ire of his Ruin, and the Re&s;olution to
compa&s;s it by all the ill Arts and Devices They could u&s;e; but till it &s;hould
be more &s;ea&s;onable, They di&s;&s;embled to Both their Ma&s;ters to have a high
E&s;teem of him, having not yet Credit enough with either to do him Harm.
They &s;aid, &startq;They would very willingly repair to him, and be directed by
<MILESTONE N="40">him: But They de&s;ired that his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf would fir&s;t &s;peak to him
(becau&s;e it would not &s;o well become them) to call tho&s;e Per&s;ons, whom
They had recommended to him, to meet together with the re&s;t with
whom He u&s;ed to advi&s;e; which the Per&s;ons They named They were
&s;ure would be very glad of, having all of them a great E&s;teem of the
Chancellor, and being well known to him,&endq; as indeed They were, and
mo&s;t of them obliged by him.</P>
<P>THE King willingly undertook it: And being &s;hortly after attended
by the Chancellor, his Maje&s;ty told him all that the other two had &s;aid to
him, and did not forget to let him know the great Good-Will They had Both
<MILESTONE N="50">profe&s;&s;ed towards him. He a&s;ked him &startq;what He thought of &s;uch and
&s;uch Men,&endq; and particularly named Mr. <HI>Clifford</HI> and Mr. <HI>Churchill,</HI> and
&s;ome other Men of better Quality and much more Intere&s;t, &startq;who&endq; He
&s;aid &startq;took it ill that They were not particularly informed what the
<PB N="186" REF="191">
King de&s;ired, and which Way They might be&s;t &s;erve him;&endq; and bade
him, &startq;that at the next Meeting of the re&s;t, the&s;e Men might likewi&s;e have
Notice to be pre&s;ent, together with Sir <HI>Harry Bennet</HI> and Mr. <HI>William Co|ventry;&endq;</HI>
for <HI>Harry Coventry</HI> (who was a much wi&s;er Man than his Bro|ther,
and had a much better Reputation with wi&s;e Men) was con&s;tantly in
tho&s;e Councils.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor told him, &startq;that great and notorious Meetings and Ca|bals
in Parliament had been always odious in Parliament: And though
they might produce &s;ome Succe&s;s in one or two Particulars till they
were di&s;covered, they had always ended unluckily; until they were<MILESTONE N="10">
introduced in the late ill Times by &s;o great a Combination, that they
could not receive any Di&s;countenance. Yet that They, who compa&s;&s;ed
all their wicked De&s;igns by tho&s;e Cabals, were &s;o jealous that They might
be overmatched by the like Practices, that when They di&s;covered any
three or four of tho&s;e, who were u&s;ed to concur with them, to have any
private Meetings, They accu&s;ed them to con&s;pire again&s;t the Parliament.
That when his Maje&s;ty returned, and all the World was full of Joy and
Delight to &s;erve him, and Per&s;ons were willing and importunate to receive
Direction how They might do it in that Convention; Care had been
taken without any Noi&s;e, or bringing any Prejudice upon tho&s;e who were<MILESTONE N="20">
willing to be In&s;truments towards the procuring what was de&s;irable, and
to prevent what would be ingrateful, that little Notice might be taken of
them, which had good Succe&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;THAT &s;ince this Parliament the Lord Trea&s;urer and He had, by his Ma|je&s;ty's
Direction, made Choice of &s;ome Per&s;ons eminent for their Affection
to the Crown, of great Experience and known Abilities, to confer with
for the better preparing and conducting what was to be done in the
Hou&s;e of Commons: But the Number of them was not &s;o great as to
give any Umbrage. Nor did They meet oftner together with them,
than upon Accidents and Contingencies was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; but ap|pointed<MILESTONE N="30">
tho&s;e few who had a mutual Confidence in each other, and every
one of which had an Influence upon others and advi&s;ed them what to
do, to meet by them&s;elves, either at the Lord <HI>Bridgman's</HI> or Mr. At|torney's
Chambers, who &s;till gave Notice to the other two of what was
nece&s;&s;ary, and received Advice. That there were very few of any
notable Con&s;ideration, who did not frequently repair to Both of them,
either to dine with them or to perform &s;ome Office of Civility; with every
one of whom They conferred, and &s;aid what was nece&s;&s;ary to inform
them what was fit for them to do.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;THAT two of tho&s;e who were named by his Maje&s;ty, Mr. <HI>Clifford</HI> and<MILESTONE N="40">
Mr. <HI>Churchill,</HI> were hone&s;t Gentlemen, and received the Advice They
were to follow from Sir <HI>Hugh Pollard,</HI> who had in Truth a very parti|cular
Influence upon all the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> and <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> Men. And that his
Maje&s;ty might know that He had not been well informed, <HI>that the others
named by him took it unkindly that They did not know his Plea&s;ure,
who were leading Men,</HI> as indeed They were; He a&s;&s;ured his Maje&s;ty
that there was not one of tho&s;e, who was not particularly con&s;ulted
with, and adverti&s;ed by &s;ome Per&s;on who was cho&s;en by every one of
them for that Purpo&s;e; and that They would by no Means re&s;ort to
any Meeting, fearing to undergo the odious Name of <HI>Undertakers,</HI> which<MILESTONE N="50">
in all Parliaments hath been a Brand: But as They had never oppo&s;ed
any Thing that related to his Service, &s;o upon any private In&s;inuation
They had been ready to propo&s;e any Thing which would not have
<PB N="187" REF="192">
been &s;o acceptable from any, who had been known to have Relation to his
Service, or to depend upon tho&s;e who had.&endq;</P>
<P>HE be&s;ought his Maje&s;ty to con&s;ider, &startq;whether any Thing had hitherto,
in near three Years, fallen out ami&s;s or &s;hort of what He had expected,
in the wary Admini&s;tration that had been in that Affair;&endq; and did not
conceal his own Fears, &startq;that putting it into a more open and wider
Channel, his Maje&s;ty's own too publick &s;peaking with the Members of
Parliament, and believing what every Man who was pre&s;ent told him pa&s;&s;ed
in Debates, and who for Want of Comprehen&s;ion as well as Memory
<MILESTONE N="10">committed many Mi&s;takes in their Relations, would be attended with
&s;ome Inconveniences not ea&s;y to be remedied.&endq; The King was not di&s;|&s;atisfied
with the Di&s;cour&s;e, but &s;eemed to approve it: However He would
have Sir <HI>Harry Bennet,</HI> Mr. <HI>Clifford</HI> and <HI>Churchill,</HI> called to the next
Meeting; and becau&s;e They were to be introduced into Company They had
not u&s;ed to conver&s;e with, that it &s;hould be at the Chancellor's Chamber,
who &s;hould let the re&s;t know the good Opinion his Maje&s;ty had of tho&s;e
who were added to the Number.</P>
<P>BY this Means and with the&s;e Circum&s;tances this Alteration was made in
the Conduct of the King's Service in the Parliament;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Alteration in the Ma|nagement of the Hou&s;e of Commons.</NOTE> upon which many other
<MILESTONE N="20">Alterations followed by Degrees, though not at once. Yet pre&s;ently it ap|peared,
that this Introduction of new Confidents was not acceptable to
tho&s;e, who thought They had very well di&s;charged their Tru&s;t. Sir <HI>Harry
Bennet</HI> was utterly unknown to them, a Man unver&s;ed in any Bu&s;ine&s;s,
who never had nor ever was like to &s;peak in the Hou&s;e, except in his Ear
who &s;ate next him to the Di&s;advantage of &s;ome who had &s;poken, and had
not the Faculties to get him&s;elf beloved, and was thought by all Men to be
a <HI>Roman Catholick,</HI> for which They had not any other Rea&s;on but from his
Indifference in all Things which concerned the Church.</P>
<P>WHEN They met fir&s;t at the Chancellor's Chamber, as the King had di|rected,
<MILESTONE N="30">They conferred freely together with little Difference of Opinion:
Though it appeared that They, who had u&s;ed to be together before, did
not u&s;e the &s;ame Freedom as formerly in delivering their particular Judg|ments,
not having Confidence enough in the new Comers, who in their
private Meetings afterwards took more upon them, rather to direct than to
advi&s;e; &s;o that the other grew un&s;atisfied in their Conver&s;ation. And though
the Meetings continued at one of the Places before mentioned, &s;ome always
di&s;continued their Attendance; &s;o that by Degrees there were le&s;s Re&s;olu|tions
taken than had been formerly: Nor was there &s;o cheerful a Con|currence,
or &s;o &s;peedy a Di&s;patch of the Bu&s;ine&s;s depending in the Hou&s;e,
<MILESTONE N="40">as had been.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, there appeared Nothing of Di&s;union in the Parliament, but
the &s;ame Zeal and Concurrence in all Things which related to the King.
The Murmurs and Di&s;contents were mo&s;t in the Country, where the Peo|ple
began to talk with more Licen&s;e and le&s;s Reverence of the Court and
of the King him&s;elf, and to reproach the Parliament for their rai&s;ing &s;o much
Money, and increa&s;ing of the Impo&s;itions upon the Kingdom, without
having done any Thing for the Redre&s;s of any Grievance that lay upon
the People. The Licen&s;e with Reference to Religion grew every Day
greater, the Conventicles more frequent and more in&s;olent, which di&s;turbed
<MILESTONE N="50">the Country exceedingly; but not &s;o much as the Liberty the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> a&s;|&s;umed,
who behaved them&s;elves with Indi&s;cretion, and bragged as if They
had a Toleration and cared not what the Magi&s;trates could do. The
Parliament had a De&s;ire to have provided again&s;t tho&s;e Evils with the &s;ame
<PB N="188" REF="193">
Rigour: But though there would have been a general Con&s;ent in any Pro|vi&s;ion
that could be made again&s;t the <HI>Fanaticks</HI> and the Conventicles, yet
there would not be the like Concurrence again&s;t the <HI>Papi&s;ts;</HI> and it was
not po&s;&s;ible to carry on the one without the other. And therefore the Court,
that They might be &s;ure to prevent the la&s;t, interrupted all that was pro|po&s;ed
again&s;t the former, which They wi&s;hed provided again&s;t, and cho&s;e
to have neither out of Fear of Both; which increa&s;ed the Di&s;orders in the
Country, and cau&s;ed more Reflections upon the Court: So that this Se&s;|&s;ion
of Parliament produced le&s;s of Moment than any other.</P>
<P>AND the King, after They had given him four Sub&s;idies, which was all<MILESTONE N="10">
the Money They could be drawn to give, that He might part as kindly
with them as He u&s;ed to do, and upon Di&s;covery of &s;everal &s;editious Meet|ings
among&s;t the Officers of the di&s;banded Army, which He could be&s;t &s;up|pre&s;s
when He had mo&s;t Lei&s;ure, He re&s;olved to prorogue the Parliament.
And &s;o &s;ending for them upon the 27th of <HI>July,</HI> He thanked them for the
Pre&s;ent which They had made to him of the four Sub&s;idies, &startq;which&endq; He told
them &startq;He would not have received from them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Speech at the Prorogation of the Parlia|ment.</NOTE> if it were not ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary for their Peace and Quiet as well as his: And that it would yet
do him very little Good, if He did not improve it by very good Hu&s;|bandry
of his own; and by retrenching tho&s;e very Expen&s;es, which in<MILESTONE N="20">
many Re&s;pects might be thought nece&s;&s;ary enough. But They &s;hould
&s;ee that He would much rather impo&s;e upon him&s;elf, than upon his Sub|jects;
and that if all Men would follow his Example in retrenching their
Expen&s;es (which po&s;&s;ibly They might do with much more Convenience
than He could do his) the Kingdom would in &s;hort Time gain what They
had given him that Day.&endq; He told them, &startq;He was very glad that They
were going into their &s;everal Countries, where their Pre&s;ence would do
much Good: And He hoped their Vigilance and Authority would pre|vent
tho&s;e Di&s;turbances, which the re&s;tle&s;s Spirits of ill and unquiet Men
would be always contriving, and of which his Maje&s;ty did a&s;&s;ure them<MILESTONE N="30">
They promi&s;ed them&s;elves &s;ome Effects that Summer. And that there had
been more Pains and unu&s;ual Ways taken to kindle the old fatal Fears
and Jealou&s;ies, than He thought He &s;hould ever have lived to have &s;een,
at lea&s;t to have &s;een &s;o countenanced.&endq;</P>
<P>HE told them, &startq;that He had expected to have had &s;ome Bills
pre&s;ented to him again&s;t the &s;everal Di&s;tempers in Religion, again&s;t
&s;editious Conventicles, and again&s;t the Growth of Popery: But that it
might be They had been in &s;ome Fear of reconciling tho&s;e Contradic|tions
in Religion into &s;ome Con&s;piracy again&s;t the publick Peace, to
which him&s;elf doubted Men of the mo&s;t contrary Motives in Con&s;cience<MILESTONE N="40">
were inclinable enough. He did promi&s;e them that He would lay that
Bu&s;ine&s;s to Heart, and the Mi&s;chiefs which might flow from tho&s;e Li|cen&s;es;
and if He lived to meet with them again, as He hoped He
&s;hould, He would him&s;elf take Care to pre&s;ent two Bills to them to that
End. And that, as He had already given it in Charge to the Judges, in
their &s;everal Circuits, to u&s;e their utmo&s;t Endeavours to prevent and pu|ni&s;h
the &s;candalous and &s;editious Meetings of <HI>Sectaries,</HI> and to convict the
<HI>Papi&s;ts;</HI> &s;o He would be as watchful, and take all the Pains He could,
that neither the one or the other &s;hould di&s;turb the Peace of the King|dom.&endq;
And adding many gracious Expre&s;&s;ions of his E&s;teem and Con|fidence<MILESTONE N="50">
in their Affections, He cau&s;ed them to be prorogued towards the
End of <HI>March,</HI> which would be the Beginning of the Year 1664.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="194">
THE King had an Intention at that Time to have prepared again&s;t the
next Meeting two &s;uch Bills as He mentioned to them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King in|tends to pre|pare $word$ Bills again&s;t the</HI> Pa|pi&s;ts $word$ S$cta|ries.</NOTE> and was well enough
content that the Parliament had not pre&s;ented &s;uch to him, which He well
fore&s;aw would not have been &s;uch as He &s;hould have been plea&s;ed with.
He would have liked the mo&s;t rigorous Acts again&s;t all the other Factions
in Religion, but did not think the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> had de&s;erved the &s;ame Severities,
which would have been provided again&s;t them with the other, it being
very apparent, that the Kingdom generally had re&s;umed their old Jealou&s;ies
of them, provoked by the very unwary Behaviour of that People, who
<MILESTONE N="10">bragged of more Credit in the Court than They could ju&s;tify, though mo&s;t
Men thought They had too much: And that was the Rea&s;on that He
had commanded the Chancellor to require the Judges, who were then be|ginning
their Circuits, to cau&s;e the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> to be convicted, which
He believed would allay much of the Jealou&s;ies in the Country, as for the
pre&s;ent it did. And then He re&s;olved to cau&s;e two &s;uch Bills to be pre|pared
for &s;everal Rea&s;ons, of which the principal was, that He might divide
them into two Bills; pre&s;uming that when He had &s;ent one again&s;t either,
They would not affect reducing Both into one, which was that which the
Catholick Party mo&s;t apprehended.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20">HIS Maje&s;ty was him&s;elf very un&s;atisfied with the imprudent Carriage of
the <HI>Catholicks,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Imprudent Be|haviour of the</HI> Papi&s;ts.</NOTE> and thought They did affect too much to appear as if They
&s;tood upon the Level with all other Subjects: And He received very parti|cular
and unque&s;tionable Information, that &s;ome Prie&s;ts had made it an
Argument to &s;ome whom They endeavoured to make their Pro&s;elytes, &startq;that
the King was of their Religion in his Heart, and would &s;hortly declare
it to all the World;&endq; with which his Maje&s;ty was marvellou&s;ly offended,
and did heartily de&s;ire that any of tho&s;e indi&s;creet Per&s;ons might be pro|ceeded
again&s;t with Severity. Yet He had no Mind that any Man &s;hould
be put to Death, which could hardly be avoided if any Man &s;hould be
<MILESTONE N="30">brought to Trial in the Ca&s;e afore&s;aid, except He had granted his Pardon,
which with the&s;e Circum&s;tances would have carried Scandal in it. Be&s;ides
He did think the wi&s;e&s;t of that Party had not carried them&s;elves with Mo|de&s;ty
enough, with what was good for them&s;elves and for his Maje&s;ty's Ho|nour.
And therefore He had, without imparting it to any Friends of
theirs, given that Direction to the Judges for convicting them, as the be&s;t
Means to reclaim them to a better Temper: And He had a Purpo&s;e, that
the Bill He meant &s;hould be prepared &s;hould more effectually perform
that Part, without expo&s;ing them to any notable Inconveniences in their
Per&s;ons or their Fortunes, if They behaved them&s;elves well and warily.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40">HE did believe,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King de&s;igns to $word$ the</HI> Papi&s;ts <HI>convicteled.</HI></NOTE> that it was nece&s;&s;ary for his Service that They &s;hould be
all convicted, that it might be evident to him&s;elf what their Numbers con|&s;i&s;ted
of and amounted to, which He believed would be found much in&s;e|riour
to what they were generally computed, and then the Danger from
their Power would not be thought &s;o formidable: And it could be no Pre|judice
to them without a further Proceeding upon their Conviction, which
He was re&s;olved to re&s;train, as He well might, and had done hitherto; re|&s;olving
within him&s;elf, that no Man &s;hould &s;uffer under tho&s;e penal Laws
which had been made again&s;t them in the Age before, if They lived like
good Subjects, and admini&s;tered no Occa&s;ion of Scandal. And as He was
<MILESTONE N="50">not re&s;erved in declaring that his gracious Purpo&s;e towards them (as hath
been &s;aid before); &s;o hitherto it had not been attended by any Mur|murs:
And yet He was not without a Purpo&s;e of keeping &s;uch a Power
over them, as might make them wholly depend upon him.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="195">
HIS Maje&s;ty did in his Judgment and Inclination put a great Difference
between tho&s;e <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> who being of antient Extraction had con|tinued
of the &s;ame Religion from Father to Son, without having ever been
<HI>Prote&s;tant,</HI> among&s;t whom there were very few who had not behaved them|&s;elves
very worthily; and tho&s;e, who &s;ince the late Troubles had apo&s;tatized
from the Church of <HI>England</HI> to that of the <HI>Roman,</HI> without any &s;uch Evi|dence
of Con&s;cience, as might not admini&s;ter ju&s;t Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that
their Inducements had been from worldly Temptations. And He did re|&s;olve
in his Bill to make a Di&s;tinction between tho&s;e Cla&s;&s;es, and to pre|vent
or at lea&s;t to di&s;courage tho&s;e Lap&s;es which fell out too frequently in<MILESTONE N="10">
the Court; nor did Men believe that They need make any Apology for
it, but appeared the more confidently in all Places. He did re&s;olve like|wi&s;e
to contract and le&s;&s;en the Number of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Per&s;ons, who
upon Mi&s;&s;ions re&s;orted hither as to an Infidel Nation (which was and is a
Grievance that the <HI>Catholicks</HI> would be glad to be ea&s;ed in), and to reduce
them into &s;uch an Order and Method by this Bill, that He might him&s;elf
know the Names of all Prie&s;ts remaining in the Kingdom, and their &s;e|veral
Stations where They re&s;ided; which mu&s;t have produced &s;uch a Secu|rity

Parliaments.</P>
<P>BUT this De&s;ign (which comprehended many other Particulars) vani&s;hed
as &s;oon as it was di&s;covered.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mea&s;ures taken to fru&s;|trate his De|&s;ign.</NOTE> The King's own Di&s;cour&s;e of a Bill that He

Jealou&s;ies; nor did They want In&s;truments or Opportunities to di&s;cover
what the Meaning of it could be. Nor was the King re&s;erved in the Ar|gument,
but communicated it with tho&s;e who He knew were well affected
to that Party, and to one or two of them&s;elves who were reputed to be
moderate Men, and to de&s;ire Nothing but the Exerci&s;e of their Religion
with the greate&s;t Secrecy and Caution, and who often informed him and<MILESTONE N="30">
complained &startq;of the Folly and Vanity of &s;ome of their Friends, and more

and Divi&s;ions there are among&s;t them, which might be cultivated to
very happy Productions: But &s;uch Ingenuity, as to be contented with what
might gratify all their own Pretences, there is not among&s;t them.</P>
<P>THESE moderate Men complained already, &startq;that the King was de|ceived
by their Enemy the Chancellor,&endq; who indeed was generally very
odious to them, for no other Rea&s;on, but becau&s;e They knew He was ir|reconcilable
to their Profe&s;&s;ion; not that They thought He de&s;ired that
the Laws &s;hould be put in Execution again&s;t them; and &s;ome of the chief<MILESTONE N="40">
of them believed him to be much their Friend, and had Obligations to
him. But They all lamented this Direction given to the Judges for their
Conviction, &startq;which&endq; They informed the King &startq;was the nece&s;&s;ary Preamble
to the highe&s;t Per&s;ecution the Law had prepared again&s;t them. That till
They were convicted They were in the &s;ame Predicament with the re&s;t of
his Subjects; but as &s;oon as They were convicted&endq; (which the Judges now
cau&s;ed to be pro&s;ecuted throughout the Kingdom), &startq;They were liable to all
the other Penalties, which his Maje&s;ty was inclined to protect them from.&endq;
They pre&s;ented to him a &s;hort Memorial of the Di&s;advantages which were
con&s;equent to a Conviction, in which They alleged &s;ome Particulars<MILESTONE N="50">
which were not clear in the Law, at lea&s;t had never been practi&s;ed in
the &s;evere&s;t Times.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="196">
THOUGH the King had well weighed all He had done before He did it,
and well knew, after all their In&s;inuations and Allegations, that none of
tho&s;e Inconveniences could en&s;ue to them, if He re&s;trained any further Pro|&s;ecution,
which He always had intended to do; yet They wrought &s;o far
upon him, that He was even &s;orry that He had proceeded &s;o far: And though
it was not fit to revoke any Part of it, yet He cared not how little it was
advanced. And for the Bill He meant to pre&s;ent in the next Se&s;&s;ion,
They &s;aid &startq;all their Security and Quiet They had enjoyed &s;ince his Ma|je&s;ty's
happy Return depended wholly upon the general Opinion, that
<MILESTONE N="10">He had Favour for them, and Satisfaction in their Duty and Obedience
as good Subjects, and their Readine&s;s to do him any Service, which
They would all make good with their Lives and all that They had.
But if He &s;hould now di&s;cover any Jealou&s;y of their Fidelities, and
that there was Need of a new Law again&s;t them, which his Purpo&s;e
of providing a Bill implied, what Mitigation &s;oever his Maje&s;ty intended
in it, it would not be in his Maje&s;ty's Power to re&s;train the Pa&s;&s;ion of
other Men; but all tho&s;e Animo&s;ities which had been hitherto covered
and concealed, as grateful to him, would upon this Occa&s;ion break
out to their De&s;truction: And therefore They hoped, that whatever Bit|terne&s;s
<MILESTONE N="20">the Parliament might expre&s;s again&s;t them when They came toge|ther,
They &s;hould receive no Invitation or Encouragement by any Jea|lou&s;y
or Di&s;plea&s;ure his Maje&s;ty &s;hould manife&s;t to have towards them.&endq;</P>
<P>THESE and the like Arguments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King gives over his Purpo&s;e.</NOTE> or the Credit of tho&s;e who urged them,
made that Impre&s;&s;ion, that He declined any further Thought of that Bill;
nor was there ever after Mention of it. The <HI>Catholicks</HI> grew bolder in all Places,
and conver&s;ant in tho&s;e Rooms of the Court into which the King's Chaplains
never pre&s;umed to enter; and to crown all their Hopes, the Lady de|clared
her&s;elf of that Faith, and inveighed &s;harply again&s;t the Church She
had been bred in.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30">DURING the Interval of the Parliament, there was not &s;uch a Vacation
from Trouble and Anxiety as was expected. The dome&s;tick Unquietne&s;s
in the Court made every Day more Noi&s;e abroad: Infinite Scandals and
Calumnies were &s;cattered among&s;t the People;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;contents in the Country.</NOTE> and They expre&s;&s;ed their
Di&s;contents upon the great Taxes and Impo&s;itions which They were com|pelled
to pay, and publickly reproached the Parliament; when They were
in Truth vexed and grieved at Heart for that which They dur&s;t not avow,
and did really believe that God was angry with the Nation, and re&s;olved to
exerci&s;e it under greater Tribulation than He had &s;o lately freed them from.
The general Want of Money was complained of, and a great Decay of
<MILESTONE N="40">Trade; &s;o that the native Commodities of the Kingdom were not tran&s;|ported.
Yet Both the&s;e were but Pretences, and re&s;ulted from Combina|tions
rather than from Rea&s;on. For it appeared by the Cu&s;toms, that the
Trade was greater than it had ever been, though &s;ome of our native Com|modities,
e&s;pecially Cloth, &s;eemed for &s;ome Time to be at a Stand; which
proceeded rather from the pre&s;ent Glut, which in the general Licen&s;e the
Interlopers had irregularly tran&s;ported in great Quantities, by which the
Prices were brought low, and could only be recovered by a Re&s;traint for
&s;ome Time, which the <HI>Merchant Adventurers</HI> put upon them&s;elves, and
would have put upon the Interlopers, who were at la&s;t too hard for them,
<MILESTONE N="50">even upon the Matter to the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the Company, that had &s;tood in
great Reputation for very many Years, and had advanced that Manufacture
to a great Height; and whether it de&s;erved that Di&s;countenance, Time mu&s;t
decide. How unrea&s;onable the other Di&s;cour&s;e was of Want of Money, there
<PB N="192" REF="197">
needs no other Argument, but the great Purcha&s;es which were every Day
made of great E&s;tates; nor was any con&s;iderable Parcel of Land in any
Part of <HI>England</HI> offered to be &s;old, but there was a Purcha&s;er at Hand ready
to buy it.</P>
<P>HOWEVER the&s;e Pretences, together with the &s;udden bringing up all the
Money, that was collected for the King, <HI>in Specie</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> which pro|ceeded
from the Bankers advancing &s;o much pre&s;ent Money for the emer|gent
Occa&s;ions, for which They had tho&s;e A&s;&s;ignments upon the Money of
the Country, did really produce &s;uch a &s;udden Fall of the Rents throughout
the Kingdom, as had never been known before: So that Men were com|pelled<MILESTONE N="10">
to abate generally a fourth Part of their annual Rents at the lea&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A &s;udden Fall of Rents.</NOTE> or
to take their Lands into their own Hands, for which They were as ill pro|vided.
All this Mi&s;chief fell upon the Nobility and greate&s;t Gentry, who
were Owners of the greate&s;t E&s;tates, every Body who&s;e E&s;tate lay in Land
undergoing a Share in the Suffering, which made the Di&s;content general;
which They thought the be&s;t Way to remedy would be to rai&s;e no more
Taxes, which They took to be the Cau&s;e why the Rents fell. In the
mean Time the Expen&s;es of the Court, and of all who depended upon it,
grew &s;till higher, and the King him&s;elf le&s;s intent upon his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and
more loved his Plea&s;ures, to which He pre&s;cribed no Limits, nor to the Ex|pen&s;es<MILESTONE N="20">
which could not but accompany them.</P>
<P>THERE was Cau&s;e enough to be jealous of the publick Peace;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Danger of an In&s;urrection.</NOTE> there
being every Day Di&s;coveries made of private Meetings and Conferences be|tween
Officers of the old Army; and that Corre&s;pondencies were &s;ettled
between them throughout the Kingdom in a wonderful Method; and that
They had a grand Committee re&s;iding in <HI>London,</HI> who had the &s;upreme
Power, and which &s;ent Orders to all the re&s;t, who were to ri&s;e in one
Day and meet at &s;everal Rendezvou&s;es. Hereupon &s;everal Per&s;ons were
apprehended and committed to Pri&s;on; and the King him&s;elf often took the
Pains to examine them; and They confe&s;&s;ed commonly more to his Maje&s;ty<MILESTONE N="30">
him&s;elf than upon any other Examination. Proclamations i&s;&s;ued often for
the bani&s;hing all Officers who had ever borne Arms again&s;t the King
twenty Miles from <HI>London,</HI> which did more publi&s;h the Apprehen&s;ion of
new Troubles.</P>
<P>THERE can be no Doubt, but that there were many &s;editious Purpo&s;es
among&s;t that People, of which there often appeared &s;o full Evidence, that
many were executed for High Trea&s;on, who were tried and condemned by
the Judges at their general Se&s;&s;ions at <HI>Newgate:</HI> Yet there was often Cau&s;e
to believe that many Men were committed, who in Truth had not been
more faulty, than in keeping ill Company and in hearing idle Di&s;cour&s;es.<MILESTONE N="40">
Informing was grown a Trade, which many affected to get Money by:
And as the King's Mini&s;ters could not reject in a Time of &s;o much Jealou&s;y,
&s;o the receiving them gave them great Trouble; for few of them were
willing to be produced as Evidence again&s;t tho&s;e They accu&s;ed, pretending,
&s;ometimes with Rea&s;on, &startq;that if They were known They &s;hould be ren|dered
u&s;ele&s;s for the future, whereas They were yet un&s;u&s;pected and ad|mitted

do in the Times that Sir <HI>Richard Browne</HI> and Sir <HI>John Robin&s;on</HI> had been
Lord Mayors; and the Officers who &s;ucceeded them proved le&s;s vigilant.<MILESTONE N="50">
A general De&s;pondency &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Minds of Men, as if They lit|tle
cared what came to pa&s;s; which did not proceed &s;o much from Malice,
as from the Di&s;ea&s;e of murmuring, which had been contracting above
<PB N="193" REF="198">
twenty Years, and became almo&s;t incorporated into the Nature of the
Nation.</P>
<P>THERE happened about this Time an Alteration in the Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An Intrigue in the Court to advance Sir</HI> H. Bennet.</NOTE> that
produced afterwards many other Alterations which were not then &s;u&s;pected,
yet even at that Time was not liked in the Court it&s;elf, and le&s;s out of it.
The Keeper of the Privy Pur&s;e, who was more fit for that Province than
for any other to which He could be applied, did not think him&s;elf yet pre|ferred
to a Station worthy of his Merit and great Qualifications. Some
Promi&s;es the King had made to him when He was at <HI>Fuentarabia,</HI> and had
<MILESTONE N="10">long much Kindne&s;s for his Per&s;on and much Delight in his Company: So
that his Friend, Mr. <HI>ONeile,</HI> who was &s;till ready to put his Maje&s;ty in
Mind of all his Services, had Nothing hard to do but to find a Vacancy
that might give Opportunity for his Advancement; and He was dexterous
in making Opportunities which He could not find, and made no Scruple
to in&s;inuate to the King, &startq;that the Abilities of neither of his Secretaries
were &s;o great but that He might be better &s;erved.&endq; Indeed his Ma|je&s;ty,
who did not naturally love old Men, had not &s;o much E&s;teem
of them as their Parts and Indu&s;try and Integrity de&s;erved, and would not
have been &s;orry if either or Both of them had died.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20">SECRETARY <HI>Nicholas</HI> had &s;erved the Crown very many Years with a very
good Acceptation,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Character of Secretary</HI> Ni|cholas.</NOTE> was made Secretary of State by the late King, and loved
and tru&s;ted by him in his neare&s;t Concernments to his Death: Nor had
any Man, who &s;erved him, a more general Reputation of Virtue and Piety
and unque&s;tionable Integrity throughout the Kingdom. He was a Man
to whom the Rebels had been always irreconcilable; and from the End of
the War lived in Bani&s;hment beyond the Seas, was with his Maje&s;ty from
the Time He left <HI>France</HI> (for whil&s;t the King was in <HI>France</HI> with his Mo|ther,
to whom the Secretary was not gracious, He remained at a Di&s;tance;
but from the Time that his Maje&s;ty came into <HI>Germany</HI> He was always
<MILESTONE N="30">with him) in the Exerci&s;e of the &s;ame Function He had under his Father,
and returned into <HI>England</HI> with him, with Hope to repair his Fortune by the
ju&s;t Perqui&s;ites of his Office, which had been very much impaired by his long
Sufferings and Bani&s;hment. He had never been in his Youth a Man of quick
and &s;udden Parts, but full of Indu&s;try and Application (which it may be is
the better Compo&s;ition), and always ver&s;ed in Bu&s;ine&s;s and all the Forms
of Di&s;patch. He was now &s;ome Years above &s;eventy, yet truly per|formed
his Office with Punctuality, and to the Satisfaction of all Men
who repaired to him: And the King thought it an envious as well as
an illnatured Thing, to di&s;charge &s;uch an Officer becau&s;e He had lived
<MILESTONE N="40">too long.</P>
<P>THE other Secretary was Secretary <HI>Morrice,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Secretary</HI> Morrice.</NOTE> who&s;e Merit had been his
having tran&s;acted all that had been between the King and the General,
which was thought to be much more than it was. Yet He had behaved
him&s;elf very well, and as much di&s;po&s;ed the General as He was capable of
being di&s;po&s;ed; and his Maje&s;ty had preferred him to that Office purely to
gratify and oblige the General; and He had behaved him&s;elf very ho|ne&s;tly
and diligently in the King's Service, and had a good Reputation in
the Hou&s;e of Commons, and did the Bu&s;ine&s;s of his Office without Re|proach.
He had lived mo&s;t Part of his Time in the Country, with the
<MILESTONE N="50">Repute of a wi&s;e Man and a very good Scholar, as indeed He was
both in the <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> Learning; but being without any Knowledge
in the modern Languages, He gave the King often Occa&s;ion to laugh at
his un&s;kilful Pronunciation of many Words. In the <HI>Latin</HI> Di&s;patches,
<PB N="194" REF="199">
which concern all the Northern Parts, He was ready, and treated with
tho&s;e Amba&s;&s;adours fluently and elegantly; and for all dome&s;tick Affairs no
Man doubted his Sufficiency, except in the Garb and Mode and Humour
of the Court.</P>
<P>AND the Inducement that brought him in made it unfit to remove him,
le&s;t it might grieve the General, who&s;e Friend and Kin&s;man He was: So
that there was no Expedient to provide for Sir <HI>Harry Bennet,</HI> but by re|moving
Secretary <HI>Nicholas</HI> by his own Con&s;ent; for the King would not do
it otherwi&s;e to &s;o old and faithful a Servant. And his Maje&s;ty was the more
inclined to it, becau&s;e it would give him the Opportunity to bring another<MILESTONE N="10">
Per&s;on into the Office of the Privy Pur&s;e, of whom He was lately grown
very fond, and towards whom He had, when He came into <HI>England,</HI> a
greater Aver&s;ion than to any Gentleman who had been abroad with him,
and that was Sir <HI>Charles Berkley,</HI> who was then Captain of the Duke of
<HI>York's</HI> Guard, and much in the good Grace of his Royal Highne&s;s.</P>
<P>WHILST this Intrigue was contriving and depending, great Care was
taken that it might not come to the Notice of the Chancellor, le&s;t if He
could not divert the King from de&s;iring it, which They believed He would
not attempt, He might di&s;&s;uade his old Friend the Secretary, with whom
He had held a long and particular Friend&s;hip, from hearkening to any<MILESTONE N="20">
Propo&s;ition, or accepting any Compo&s;ition; which They believed not un|rea&s;onably
that the other would be very &s;olicitous in, as well to keep a
Man in, whom He could entirely tru&s;t, as to keep another out, of who&s;e
Abilities He had no E&s;teem, and in who&s;e Affection He had no Confidence:
And it was thought by many, that the &s;ame Apprehen&s;ion prevailed with
the good old Man him&s;elf to cheri&s;h the Secrecy. Certain it is, that the
whole Matter was re&s;olved and con&s;ented to, before ever the Chancellor had
a Su&s;picion of it.</P>
<P>ONEILE, who had always the Skill to bring that to pa&s;s by others which
He could not barefaced appear in him&s;elf, in&s;inuated to Mr. <HI>A&s;hburnham,</HI><MILESTONE N="30">
who pretended and I think had much Friend&s;hip for the Secretary, &startq;that
the King thought the Secretary too old to take &s;o much Pains, and often
wi&s;hed that his Friends would per&s;uade him to retire, that there might be
a younger Man in the Office, who could attend upon his Maje&s;ty at all
Hours and in all Journies; but that his Maje&s;ty always &s;pake kindly of
him, and as if He re&s;olved to give him an ample Recompen&s;e:&endq; And in
Confidence told him, &startq;that the King had an impatient De&s;ire to have Sir
<HI>Harry Bennet</HI> Secretary of State.&endq; <HI>A&s;hburnham</HI> was well ver&s;ed in the
Artifices of Court too; and thought He might very well perform the Office of
a Friend to his old Confident, and at the &s;ame Time find a new and more<MILESTONE N="40">
u&s;eful Friend for him&s;elf, by having a Hand in procuring a large Satisfac|tion
for the old, and likewi&s;e facilitating the Way for the Introduction of a
new Secretary, who could not forget the Obligation. So He told <HI>ONeile,</HI>
&startq;that all the World knew that He had for many Years profe&s;&s;ed a great
Friend&s;hip for Secretary <HI>Nicholas</HI>&endq; (They had been Both Servants at the
&s;ame Time to the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> when He was killed), &startq;and that
He &s;hould be much troubled to &s;ee him di&s;placed in his old Age with
Contempt; but if his Maje&s;ty would di&s;mi&s;s him with Honour and Reward,
that He might be able to provide for his Wife and Children, He would
make no Scruple to per&s;uade him to quit his Employment.&endq; <HI>ONeile</HI> had<MILESTONE N="50">
all He looked for, and only enjoined him Secrecy, &startq;that it might not come
to the King's Ear that He had communicated this Secret to any Man; and
<PB N="195" REF="200">
He did pre&s;ume, that before any Re&s;olution was taken in it, his Maje&s;ty
would &s;peak of it to the Chancellor.&endq;</P>
<P>WITHIN a Day or two the King &s;ent for <HI>A&s;hburnham</HI> and told him,
&startq;He knew He was a Friend to the Secretary, who was now grown old,
and not able to take the Pains He had done; that He had &s;erved his Fa|ther
and him&s;elf very faithfully, and had &s;pent his Fortune in his Service;
that if He were willing to retire, for without his Con&s;ent He would do
Nothing, He would give him ten thou&s;and Pounds, or any other Recom|pen&s;e
He &s;hould choo&s;e,&endq; implying a Title of Honour: But intimated,
<MILESTONE N="10">though He referred all to his own Will, &startq;that He wi&s;hed, and that it
would be acceptable to him, that the Office might be vacant and at his
Maje&s;ty's Di&s;po&s;al.&endq;</P>
<P>HE undertook the Employment very cheerfully, and quickly imparted
all that had pa&s;&s;ed from the King, and all that He knew before, to the Se|cretary;
who was not fond of the Court, and thought He had lived long
enough there, having &s;een and ob&s;erved much that He was grieved at Heart
to &s;ee. He con&s;idered, that though this Me&s;&s;age was very gracious, and
offered a noble Reward for his Service, it did withal appear that the King
did de&s;ire He &s;hould be gone; and having de&s;igned a Succe&s;&s;our to him,
<MILESTONE N="20">who had already much Credit with him, if He &s;hould &s;eem &s;ullen or un|willing,
He might in a &s;hort Time be put out without any Con&s;ideration,
or at mo&s;t with the Promi&s;e of one. Thereupon He wi&s;hed his Friend &startq;to
a&s;&s;ure the King, that He would very readily do what&s;oever his Maje&s;ty
thought nece&s;&s;ary for his Service; but He hoped, that after above forty
Years &s;pent in the Service of the Crown, He &s;hould not be expo&s;ed to
Di&s;grace and Contempt. That He had a Wife and Children, who had
all &s;uffered with him in Exile till his Maje&s;ty's Return, and for whom He
could not make a competent Provi&s;ion without his Maje&s;ty's Bounty; and
therefore He hoped, that before his Maje&s;ty required the Signet, He would
<MILESTONE N="30">cau&s;e the Recompen&s;e He de&s;igned to be more than what He had men|tioned,
and to be fir&s;t paid.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS Province could not be put into a fitter Hand, for it was managed
with notable Skill. And as &s;oon as it was known that the Secretary would
willingly re&s;ign, which was feared, and that only a better Recompen&s;e was
expected, every Body was willing that the King &s;hould make the Act look
as graciou&s;ly as might be,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Secretary</HI> Ni|cholas <HI>re&s;ig$s.</HI></NOTE> that the Succe&s;&s;or might be attended with the
le&s;s Envy. And Mr. <HI>A&s;hburnham</HI> cultivated their Impatience &s;o &s;kilfully,
that it co&s;t the King, in pre&s;ent Money and Land or Lea&s;e, very little le&s;s
than twenty thou&s;and Pounds, to bring in a Servant whom very few cared
<MILESTONE N="40">for, in the Place of an old Servant whom every Body loved: And He re|ceived
all that was promi&s;ed, before He re&s;igned his Place. And if the
Change had been as good for the King, as it was for the good old Secre|tary,
every Body would have been glad.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sir</HI> H. Ben|net <HI>made Se|cretary of State and Sir</HI> Charles Berk|ley <HI>Privy Pur&s;e.</HI></NOTE> And thus Sir <HI>Harry Bennet</HI> was
at the King's Charge accommodated, even to the Satisfaction of his own
Ambition: And his Maje&s;ty was as well plea&s;ed, that He had gotten Sir
<HI>Charles Berkley</HI> into the other Office about his Per&s;on, whom He every
Day loved with more Pa&s;&s;ion, for what Rea&s;on no Man knew nor could
imagine.</P>
<P>AND from this Time They who &s;tood at any near Di&s;tance could not
<MILESTONE N="50">but di&s;cern,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel|lor's Intere&s;t declines.</NOTE> that the Chancellor's Intere&s;t and Credit with the King mani|fe&s;tly
declined: Not that either of the&s;e two pretended to be his Rival, or
appeared to cro&s;s any Thing in Council that He propo&s;ed or advi&s;ed; on
the contrary, They Both profe&s;&s;ed great Re&s;pect towards him. One of
<PB N="196" REF="201">
them, being no Privy Coun&s;ellor, made great Profe&s;&s;ions and Addre&s;&s;es to
him by him&s;elf, and by &s;ome Friends who had much Credit with him; pro|te&s;ted
&startq;again&s;t meddling at all in Bu&s;ine&s;s, and that He only hoped to
gain a Fortune by his Maje&s;ty's Favour, upon which He might be able to
live;&endq; nor did it appear afterwards, that He did to his Death wi&s;h that
the Chancellor's Power &s;hould be le&s;&s;ened: And the other made all the Pro|fe&s;&s;ions
imaginable of Affection and Re&s;pect to him, and repaired upon Oc|ca&s;ions
to him for Advice and for Direction. Nor in Truth could either of
them have done him any Prejudice at that Time with the King by pre|tending
to do it; but by pretending the contrary by Degrees got Power<MILESTONE N="10">
to do it.</P>
<P>HIS Maje&s;ty did not in the lea&s;t Degree withdraw his Favour from him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King &s;till continues his Favour to him.</NOTE>
heard him as willingly, came as often to him, was as little re&s;erved in any
Thing; only in one Particular He did with &s;ome Solemnity conjure him
never to mention it to him again, in which He did not yet punctually obey
him, nor avoid &s;ea&s;onably &s;aying any Thing to him which He believed to be
his Duty, and which his Maje&s;ty never &s;eemed to take ill. And whenever
He &s;pake to him of either of the other two Gentlemen, which He frequently
did with much Kindne&s;s, He always added &s;omewhat of Both their Re&s;pects
and E&s;teem for him, as a Thing that plea&s;ed him well; and &s;aid once,<MILESTONE N="20">
&startq;that it concerned them, for whenever He &s;hould di&s;cern it to be other|wi&s;e,
He &s;hould make them repent it.&endq; Yet notwith&s;tanding all this,
from that Time Coun&s;els were not &s;o &s;ecret, and greater Liberty was taken
to talk of the publick Affairs in the Evening Conver&s;ation, than had been
before, when they happened &s;ometimes to be &s;hortly mentioned in the Pro|duction
of &s;ome Wit or Je&s;t; but now they were often taken into De|bate,
and cen&s;ured with too much Liberty with Reference to Things and
Per&s;ons; and the King him&s;elf was le&s;s fixed and more irre&s;olute in his
Coun&s;els; and inconvenient Grants came every Day to the Seal for the Be|nefit
of particular Per&s;ons, again&s;t which the King had particularly re&s;olved,<MILESTONE N="30">
and at la&s;t by Importunity would have pa&s;&s;ed. La&s;tly, Both the&s;e Per&s;ons
were mo&s;t devoted to the Lady, and much depended upon her Intere&s;t,
and con&s;equently were ready to do any Thing that would be grateful
to her.</P>
<P>THERE was another Mi&s;chief contrived about this Time, that had a much
wor&s;e Influence upon the Publick, except We &s;hall call it the &s;ame, becau&s;e
it did in Truth proceed from it.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The fir&s;t Ri&s;e of the</HI> Dutch <HI>War.</HI></NOTE> Though the publick State of Affairs, in
Re&s;pect of the Di&s;tempers and Di&s;compo&s;ures which are mentioned before,
and that the Expen&s;es exceeded what was a&s;&s;igned to &s;upport it, whereby
the great Debt was little dimini&s;hed, yielded little Delight to tho&s;e who<MILESTONE N="40">
were mo&s;t tru&s;ted to manage and provide for them, and who had a melan|cholick
and dreadful Apprehen&s;ion of Con&s;equences: Yet whil&s;t the Nation
continued in Peace, and without any Danger from any foreign Enemy,
the Pro&s;pect was &s;o plea&s;ant, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e who &s;tood at a Di&s;tance,
that They &s;aw Nothing worthy of any Man's Fear; and there was rea|&s;onable
Hope, that the Expen&s;es might every Year be reduced within rea|&s;onable
Bounds. But all that Hope vani&s;hed, when there appeared an im|moderate
De&s;ire to engage the Nation in a War.</P>
<P>UPON the King's fir&s;t Arrival in <HI>England,</HI> He manife&s;ted a very great
De&s;ire to improve the general Traffick and Trade of the Kingdom, and<MILESTONE N="50">
upon all Occa&s;ions conferred with the mo&s;t active Merchants upon it, and
offered all that He could contribute to the Advancement thereof. He
crected a Council of Trade, which produced little other Effect than the Op|portunity
<PB N="197" REF="202">
of Mens &s;peaking together, which po&s;&s;ibly di&s;po&s;ed them to
think more, and to con&s;ult more effectually in private, than They could in
&s;uch a Crowd of Commi&s;&s;ioners. Some Merchants and Seamen made a
Propo&s;ition by Mr. <HI>William Coventry</HI> and &s;ome few others to the Duke of
<HI>York,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Erection of the Royal</HI> African <HI>Com|pany.</HI></NOTE> &startq;for the Erection of a Company in which They de&s;ired his Royal
Highne&s;s to pre&s;ide&endq; (and from thence it was called the Royal Company),
to which his Maje&s;ty &s;hould grant the &s;ole Trade of <HI>Guinea,</HI> which in a
&s;hort Time They pre&s;umed would bring great Advantage to the Publick,
and much Profit to the Adventurers, who &s;hould begin upon a joint
<MILESTONE N="10">Stock, to be managed by a Council of &s;uch as &s;hould be cho&s;en out of the
Adventurers.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS Privilege had before the Troubles been granted by the late King
to Sir <HI>Nicholas Cri&s;pe</HI> and others named by him, who had at their own
Charge &s;ent Ships thither: And Sir <HI>Nicholas</HI> had at his own Charge bought
a Nook of Ground, that lay into the Sea, of the true Owners thereof (all
that Coa&s;t being inhabited by Heathens), and built thereon a good Fort
and Warehou&s;es, under which the Ships lay; and He had advanced this
Trade &s;o far before the Troubles, that He found it might be carried on with
very great Benefit. After the Rebellion began, and Sir <HI>Nicholas</HI> betook
<MILESTONE N="20">him&s;elf to &s;erve the King, &s;ome Merchants continued the Trade, and either
by his Con&s;ent or <HI>Cromwell's</HI> Power had the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Fort, called
<HI>Cormantine;</HI> which was &s;till in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> when his Ma|je&s;ty
returned, though the Trade was &s;mall, in Re&s;pect the <HI>Dutch</HI> had fixed
a &s;tronger Quarter at no great Di&s;tance from it, and &s;ent much more Ships
and Commodities thither, and returned once every Year to their own Coun|try
with much Wealth. The chief End of this Trade was, be&s;ides the
putting off great Quantities of our own Manufactures according as the Trade
&s;hould advance, to return with Gold, which that Coa&s;t produced in good
Quantity, and with Slaves, <HI>Blacks,</HI> which were readily fold to any Planta|tion
<MILESTONE N="30">at great Prices.</P>
<P>THE Model was &s;o well prepared, and the whole Method for governing
the Trade &s;o rationally propo&s;ed, that the Duke was much plea&s;ed with it,
and quickly procured a Charter to be granted from the King to this Com|pany
with ample Privileges,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Charter granted to it.</NOTE> and his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf to become an Adven|turer,
and which was more, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them for the fir&s;t E&s;tabli&s;hment of their
Trade with the U&s;e of &s;ome of his own Ships. The Duke was the Gover|nour
of the Company, with Power to make a Deputy: All the other Offi|cers
and Council were cho&s;en by the Company, which con&s;i&s;ted of Per&s;ons
of Honour and Quality, every one of which brought in five hundred Pounds
<MILESTONE N="40">for the fir&s;t joint Stock, with which They &s;et out the fir&s;t Ships; upon
the Return whereof They received &s;o much Encouragement and Benefit,
that They compounded with Sir <HI>Nicholas Cri&s;pe</HI> for his Propriety in the
Fort and Ca&s;tle; and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of another Place upon the
Coa&s;t, and &s;ent many Ships thither, which made very good Returns, by
putting off their <HI>Blacks</HI> at the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> and other the King's Plantations
at their own Prices, and brought Home &s;uch Store of Gold that admini&s;|tered
the fir&s;t Occa&s;ion for the Coinage of tho&s;e Pieces, which from thence
had the Denomination of <HI>Guineas;</HI> and what was afterwards made of the
&s;ame Species, was coined of the Gold that was brought from that Coa&s;t by
<MILESTONE N="50">the Royal Company. In a Word, if that Company be not broken or di&s;|ordered
by the Jealou&s;y that the Gentlemen Adventurers have of the Mer|chants,
and their Opinion that They under&s;tand the My&s;teries of Trade as
well as the other, by which They refu&s;e to concur in the nece&s;&s;ary Expe|dients
<PB N="198" REF="203">
propo&s;ed by the other, and interpo&s;e un&s;kilful Overtures of their own
with Pertinacy, it will be found a Model equally to advance the Trade of
<HI>England</HI> with that of any other Company, even that of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>FROM the fir&s;t Entrance into this Trade, which the Duke was exceedingly
di&s;po&s;ed to advance, and was con&s;tantly pre&s;ent him&s;elf at all Councils,
which were held once a Week in his own Lodgings at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> it was
ea&s;ily di&s;covered that the <HI>Dutch</HI> had a better Trade there than the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI>
which They were then willing to believe that They had no Right to, for
that the Trade was fir&s;t found out and &s;ettled there by the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> which
was a &s;ufficient Foundation to &s;ettle it upon this Nation, and to exclude all<MILESTONE N="10">
others, at lea&s;t by the &s;ame Law that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> enjoys the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI>
and the <HI>Dutch</HI> what They or the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the <HI>Ea&s;t.</HI> But
this They quickly found would not e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch a Title as would bear a
Di&s;pute: The having &s;ent a Ship or two thither, and built a little Fort,
could not be allowed &s;uch a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion as would exclude all other Nations.
And the Truth was; the <HI>Dutch</HI> were there &s;ome Time before us, and the
<HI>Dane</HI> before either: And the <HI>Dutch,</HI> which was the true Grievance, had
planted them&s;elves more advantageou&s;ly, upon the Bank of a River, than
We had done; and by the Erection of more Forts were more &s;trongly
&s;eated, and drove a much greater Trade, which They did not believe They<MILESTONE N="20">
would be per&s;uaded to quit.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Mer|chants de&s;irous of a War with the</HI> Dutch.</NOTE> This drew the Di&s;cour&s;e from the Right to
the Ea&s;ine&s;s, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of two or three of the King's Ships, to take
away all that the <HI>Dutch</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in and about <HI>Guinea,</HI> there having
never been a Ship of War &s;een in tho&s;e Parts; &s;o that the Work might
be pre&s;ently done, and &s;uch an Alliance made with the Natives, who did
not love the <HI>Dutch,</HI> that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> might be unque&s;tionably po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
the whole Trade of that Country, which would be of ine&s;timable Profit to
the Kingdom.</P>
<P>THE Merchants took much Delight to enlarge them&s;elves upon this Ar|gument,
and &s;hortly after to di&s;cour&s;e &startq;of the infinite Benefit that would<MILESTONE N="30">
accrue from a barefaced War again&s;t the <HI>Dutch,</HI> how ea&s;ily They might
be &s;ubdued, and the Trade carried by the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> That <HI>Cromwell</HI> had
always beaten them, and thereby gotten the greate&s;t Glory He had, and
brought them upon their Knees; and could totally have &s;ubdued them, if
He had not thought it more for his Intere&s;t to have &s;uch a Second,
whereby He might the better &s;upport his U&s;urpation again&s;t the King.
And therefore, after They had con&s;ented to all the infamous Conditions
of the total abandoning his Maje&s;ty, and as far as in them lay to the Extir|pation
of all the Royal Family, and to a perpetual Exclu&s;ion of the Prince
of <HI>Orange,</HI> He made a firm Peace with them; which They had not yet<MILESTONE N="40">
performed, by their retaining &s;till the I&s;land of <HI>Poleroone,</HI> which They
had &s;o long &s;ince barbarou&s;ly taken from the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and which They
had expre&s;&s;ly promi&s;ed and undertaken to deliver in the la&s;t Treaty, af|ter
<HI>Cromwell</HI> had compelled them to pay a great Sum of Money for the
Damages which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had &s;u&s;tained at <HI>Amboyna,</HI> when all the De|mands
and Threats from King <HI>James</HI> could never procure any Satisfac|tion
for that foul Action.&endq;</P>
<P>THESE Di&s;cour&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Duke of</HI> York <HI>much for it.</HI></NOTE> often reiterated in Sea&s;on and out of Sea&s;on, made
a very deep Impre&s;&s;ion in the Duke; who having been even from his
Childhood in the Command in Armies and in his Nature inclined to the<MILESTONE N="50">
mo&s;t difficult and dangerous Enterpri&s;es, was already weary of having &s;o
little to do, and too impatiently longed for any War, in which He knew
He could not but have the chief Command. But the&s;e Kind of Debates,
<PB N="199" REF="204">
or the Place in which they were made, could contribute little to an Af|fair
of &s;o huge an Importance, otherwi&s;e than by inciting the Duke, which
they did too much, to con&s;ider and affect it, and to di&s;po&s;e others who
were near him to inculcate the &s;ame Thoughts into him, as an Argument
in which his Honour would be much exalted in the Eye of all the World:
And to the&s;e good Offices They were enough di&s;po&s;ed by the Re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s
and Unquietne&s;s of their own Natures, and by many other Motives for the ac|compli&s;hing
their own De&s;igns, and getting more Power into their own Hands.</P>
<P>BUT there was lately, very lately, a Peace fully concluded with the <HI>States
<MILESTONE N="10">General</HI> upon the &s;ame Terms, Articles and Conditions, which They had
formerly yielded to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> being very much more advantageous than
They had ever granted in any Treaty to the Crown. And at the Time
of the Conclu&s;ion of the Peace, They delivered their Orders from the
<HI>States General</HI> and their <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company for the Delivery of the I&s;land
of <HI>Poleroone</HI> to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> which <HI>Cromwell</HI> him&s;elf had extorted from them
with the greate&s;t Difficulty: So that there was now no Colour of Ju&s;tice
to make a War upon them. Be&s;ides that there were at pre&s;ent great
Jealou&s;ies from <HI>Spain</HI> upon the Marriage with <HI>Portugal;</HI> nor did <HI>France,</HI>
which had broken Promi&s;e in making a Treaty with <HI>Holland,</HI> make any
<MILESTONE N="20">Ha&s;te to renew the Treaty with <HI>England.</HI> And therefore it could not but
&s;eem &s;trange to all Men, that when We had only made a Treaty of Peace
with <HI>Holland,</HI> and that &s;o newly, and upon &s;o long Con&s;ideration, and
had none with either of the Crowns, We &s;hould &s;o much de&s;ire to enter
into a War with them.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, the Duke's Heart was &s;et upon it, and He loved to &s;peak of
it, and the Benefits which would attend it. He &s;pake of it to the King,
whom He found no Ways inclined to it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King not inclined to it.</NOTE> and therefore He knew it was
unfit to propo&s;e it in Council: Yet He &s;pake often of it to &s;uch of the
Lords of whom He had the be&s;t Opinion, and found many of them to
<MILESTONE N="30">concur with him in the Opinion of the Advantages which might ari&s;e from
thence. And &s;ometimes He thought He left the King di&s;po&s;ed to it, by
an Argument which He found prevailed with many: &startq;That the Differ|ences
and Jealou&s;ies in Point of Trade, which did every Day fall out and
would every Day increa&s;e between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who had
in the late Di&s;tractions gotten great Advantages, would unavoidably pro|duce
a War between them; and then that the Que&s;tion only was, whe|ther
it were not better for us to begin it now, when They do not ex|pect
it, and We are better prepared for it than probably We &s;hall be
then; or to &s;tay two or three Years, in which the &s;ame Jealou&s;y would
<MILESTONE N="40">provoke them to be well provided, when probably We might not be
ready. That We had the be&s;t Sea Officers in the World, many of
whom had often beaten the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and knew how to do it again;
and a Multitude of excellent Mariners and common Seamen: All which,
if They found that Nothing would be done at Home, would di&s;per&s;e
them&s;elves in Merchant Voyages to the <HI>Indies</HI> and the <HI>Straits;</HI> and
probably &s;o many good Men would never be found together again.&endq;</P>
<P>AND with &s;uch Arguments He many Times thought that He left the
King much moved: But when He &s;pake to him again (though He knew
that He had no Kindne&s;s for the <HI>Dutch</HI>) his Maje&s;ty was changed, and
<MILESTONE N="50">very aver&s;e to a War; which He imputed to the Chancellor, who had not
di&s;&s;embled, as often as his Highne&s;s &s;pake to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel|lor oppo&s;es it.</NOTE> to be pa&s;&s;ionately and ob|&s;tinately
again&s;t it. And He did take all the Opportunities He could find to
confirm the King in his Aver&s;ion to it, who was in his Heart aver&s;e from it,
<PB N="200" REF="205">
by pre&s;enting to him the State of his own Affairs, &startq;the great Debt that yet
lay upon him, which with Peace and good Hu&s;bandry might be in &s;ome
Time paid; but a War would involve him in &s;o much greater, that
no Man could &s;ee the End of it. That He would be able to pre&s;erve
him&s;elf again&s;t the Factions and Di&s;tempers in his own Kingdom, and
probably &s;uppre&s;s them, if He were without a foreign Enemy: But if He
&s;hould be engaged in a War abroad, his dome&s;tick Divi&s;ions, e&s;pecially
tho&s;e in Religion, would give him more Trouble than He could well &s;trug|gle
withal.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;THAT it was an erroneous A&s;&s;umption, <HI>that the</HI> Dutch <HI>would be better<MILESTONE N="10">
provided for a War two or three Years hence, and his Maje&s;ty wor&s;e,</HI> for
which there was no Rea&s;on. That within that Time it would be his own
Fault, if the Di&s;tempers in his three Kingdoms were not compo&s;ed, which
would make him much fitter for a War; whereas now neither of them
could be &s;aid to be in Peace, that of <HI>Ireland</HI> being totally un&s;ettled, and
that of <HI>Scotland</HI> not yet well plea&s;ed, and <HI>England</HI> far from it. That in
that Time it was very probable that the two Crowns would be again en|gaged
in a War; &s;ince it was generally believed, and with great Rea&s;on,
that <HI>France</HI> only expected the Death of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who was very
infirm, and meant then to fall into <HI>Flanders,</HI> having at the &s;ame Time<MILESTONE N="20">
with great Expen&s;e provided great Magazines of Corn and Hay upon the
Borders, which could be for no other End. That whil&s;t He continued
in Peace, his Friend&s;hip would be valuable to all the Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI>
and the two Crowns would &s;trive who &s;hould gain him: But if He en|gaged
in a War, and in &s;uch a War as that with <HI>Holland,</HI> which would
interrupt and di&s;turb all the Trade of the Kingdom, upon which the
greate&s;t Part of his Revenue did ri&s;e; all other Princes would look on,
and not much e&s;teem any Offices He could perform to them. And la&s;tly,
that a little Time might po&s;&s;ibly admini&s;ter a ju&s;t Occa&s;ion of a War,
which at pre&s;ent there was not.&endq;<MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>THESE, and better Arguments which the King's own Under&s;tanding &s;ug|ge&s;ted
to him, made him fully re&s;olve again&s;t the War, and to endeavour to
change his Brother from affecting it, which wrought not at all upon him;
but finding that many Things fell from the King in the Argument, which
had been alleged to him&s;elf by the Chancellor, He concluded the Mi&s;chief
came from him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of|fended with him for it.</NOTE> and was di&s;plea&s;ed accordingly, and complained to his
Wife, &startq;that her Father &s;hould oppo&s;e him in an Affair upon which He knew
his Heart was &s;o much &s;et, and of which every Body took &s;o much No|tice;&endq;
which troubled her very much. And She very earne&s;tly de&s;ired her
Father, &startq;that He would no more oppo&s;e the Duke in that Matter.&endq; He<MILESTONE N="40">
an&s;wered her, &startq;that She did not enough under&s;tand the Con&s;equence
of that Affair; but that He would take Notice to the Duke of what She
had &s;aid, and give him the be&s;t An&s;wer He could.&endq; And accordingly
He waited upon the Duke, who very frankly confe&s;&s;ed to him, &startq;that He
took it very unkindly, that He &s;hould &s;o po&s;itively endeavour to cro&s;s a
De&s;ign &s;o honourable in it&s;elf, and &s;o much de&s;ired by the City of <HI>London;</HI>
and He was confident it would be very grateful to the Parliament, and
that They would &s;upply the King with Money enough to carry it on,
which would an&s;wer the chief Objection. That He was engaged to pur|&s;ue
it, and He could not but be &s;orry and di&s;plea&s;ed, that every Body<MILESTONE N="50">
&s;hould &s;ee how little Credit He had with him.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Chancellor told him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel|ler &s;atisfies the Duke.</NOTE> &startq;that He had no Apprehen&s;ion that any &s;o|ber
Man in <HI>England,</HI> or his Highne&s;s him&s;elf, &s;hould believe that He
<PB N="201" REF="206">
could fail in his Duty to him, or that He would omit any Opportunity
to make it manife&s;t, which He could never do without being a Fool or
a Madman. On the other Hand, He could never give an Advice, or
con&s;ent to it whoever gave it, which in his Judgment and Con&s;cience
would be very mi&s;chievous to the Crown and to the Kingdom, though
his Royal Highne&s;s or the King him&s;elf were inclined to it.&endq; He did
a&s;&s;ure him, &startq;that He found the King very aver&s;e from any Thought
of this War, before He ever di&s;covered his own Opinion of it;&endq; but de|nied
not, &startq;that He had taken all Opportunities to confirm him in that
<MILESTONE N="10">Judgment by Arguments that He thought could not be an&s;wered; and
that the Con&s;equence of that War would be very pernicious. That He
did pre&s;ume that many good Men, with whom He had conferred, did
&s;eem to concur with his Highne&s;s out of Duty to him, and as They &s;aw
it would be grateful to him, or upon a &s;udden, and without making tho&s;e
Reflections which would afterwards occur to them, and make them change
their Minds. That a few Merchants, nor all the Merchants of <HI>London,</HI>
were not the City of <HI>London,</HI> which had had War enough, and could
only become rich by Peace. That He did not think the Parliament
would be forward to encourage that War; nor &s;hould the King be de|&s;irous
<MILESTONE N="20">that They &s;hould interpo&s;e their Advice in it, &s;ince it was a Subject
entirely in the King's own Determination: But if They &s;hould appear
never &s;o forward in it, He was old enough to remember when a Par|liament
did advi&s;e, and upon the Matter compel, his Grandfather King
<HI>James</HI> to enter into a War with <HI>Spain,</HI> upon Promi&s;e of ample Supplies;
and yet when He was engaged in it, They gave him no more Supply;
&s;o that at la&s;t the Crown was compelled to accept of a Peace not very
honourable.&endq;</P>
<P>BESIDE the Arguments He had u&s;ed to the King, He be&s;ought his High|ne&s;s
to reflect upon &s;ome others more immediately relating to him&s;elf,
<MILESTONE N="30">&startq;upon the Want of able Men to conduct the Coun&s;els upon which &s;uch a
War mu&s;t be carried on; how few Accidents might expo&s;e the Crown to
tho&s;e Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, that it might with more Difficulty be buoyed up than it
had lately been;&endq; with many other Arguments, which He thought made
&s;ome Impre&s;&s;ion upon the Duke.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The De&s;ign for the pre&s;ent drops.</NOTE> And for &s;ome Months there was no
more Mention or Di&s;cour&s;e in the Court of the War; though They
who fir&s;t laid the De&s;ign &s;till cultivated it, and made little Doubt of
bringing it at la&s;t to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>AT or about this Time there was a Tran&s;action of great Importance,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Sale of</HI> Dunkirk.</NOTE>
which at the Time was not popular nor indeed under&s;tood, and afterwards
<MILESTONE N="40">was objected again&s;t the Chancellor in his Misfortunes, as a principal Argu|ment
of his Infidelity and Corruption; which was the Sale of <HI>Dunkirk:</HI> The
whole Proceeding whereof &s;hall be plainly and exactly related from the Be|ginning
to the End thereof.</P>
<P>THE Charge and Expen&s;e the Crown was at; the Pay of the Land
Forces and Garri&s;ons; the great Fleets &s;et out to Sea for the Reduction of
the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Pirates of <HI>Algiers</HI> and <HI>Tunis,</HI> and for guarding the narrow Seas,
and Security of the Merchants; the con&s;tant yearly Charge of the Garri&s;on
of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> of that at <HI>Tangier,</HI> and the va&s;t Expen&s;e of building a Mole
there, for which there was an E&s;tabli&s;hment, together with the Garri&s;ons at
<MILESTONE N="50"><HI>Bombayne</HI> and in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> (none of which had been known to the Crown
in former Times); and the Lord Trea&s;urer's frequent Repre&s;entation of all
this to the King, as &s;o prodigious an Expen&s;e as could never be &s;upported;
had put his Maje&s;ty to frequent Con&s;ultations how He might le&s;&s;en and
<PB N="202" REF="207">
&s;ave any Part of it. But no Expedient could be re&s;olved upon. The Lord
Trea&s;urer, who was mo&s;t troubled when Money was wanted, had many
&s;ecret Conferences with the General and with the be&s;t Seamen, of the Be|nefit
that accrued to the Crown by keeping of <HI>Dunkirk;</HI> the con&s;tant
Charge and Expen&s;e whereof amounted to above one hundred and twenty
thou&s;and Pounds yearly: And He found by them that it was a Place of
little Importance. It is true that He had conferred of it with the Chan|cellor,
with whom He held a fa&s;t Friend&s;hip;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel|lor again&s;t it.</NOTE> but found him &s;o aver&s;e
from it, that He re&s;olved to &s;peak with him no more, till the King had taken
&s;ome Re&s;olution. And to that Purpo&s;e He per&s;uaded the General to go<MILESTONE N="10">
with him to the King and to the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> telling them Both, &startq;that
the Chancellor mu&s;t know Nothing of it:&endq; And after &s;everal Debates the
King thought it &s;o coun&s;ellable a Thing, that He re&s;olved to have it debated
before that Committee which He tru&s;ted in his mo&s;t &s;ecret Affairs; and the
Chancellor being then lame of the Gout, He commanded that all tho&s;e Lords
&s;hould attend him at his Hou&s;e.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bu&s;ine&s;s referred to a Committee.</NOTE> Be&s;ide his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf and the Duke
of <HI>York,</HI> there appeared the Lord Trea&s;urer, the General, the Earl of <HI>Sand|wich,</HI>
the Vice-Chamberlain Sir <HI>George Carteret,</HI> who had been a great
Commander at Sea, and the two Secretaries of State. When the King en|tered
the Room with the Lord Trea&s;urer, He de&s;ired his Maje&s;ty, &s;miling,<MILESTONE N="20">
&startq;that He would take the Chancellor's Staff from him, otherwi&s;e He would
break his Head.&endq; When They were all &s;ate, the King told him, &startq;They were
all come to debate an Affair that He knew He was again&s;t, which was the
parting with <HI>Dunkirk;</HI> but He did believe, when He had heard all that was
&s;aid for it and again&s;t it, He would change his Mind, as He him&s;elf had
done.&endq; And &s;o the Debate was entered into in this Method, after enough
was &s;aid of the Straights the Crown was in, and what the yearly Ex|pen&s;e
was.</P>
<P>(1.) &startq;THAT the Profit which did or could accrue to the Kingdom by
the keeping of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was very incon&s;iderable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rea&s;ons urged for parting with it.</NOTE> whether in War or<MILESTONE N="30">
Peace. That by Sea $it was very little u&s;eful, it being no Harbour,
nor having Place for the King's Ships to ride in with Safety; and that if
it were in the Hand of an Enemy, it could do us little Prejudice, be|cau&s;e
three or four Ships might block it up, and keep it from infe&s;ting
its Neighbours: And that though heretofore it had been a Place of Licen&s;e
at Sea, and had much ob&s;tructed Trade by their Men of War, yet that
proceeded only from the Un&s;kilfulne&s;s of that Time in applying proper
Remedies to it; which was manife&s;t by <HI>Cromwell's</HI> blocking them up, and
re&s;training them when He made War upon them, in&s;omuch as all the Men
of War left that Place, and betook them&s;elves to other Harbours. That it<MILESTONE N="40">
was &s;o weak to the Land (notwith&s;tanding the great Charge his Maje&s;ty
had been at in the Fortifications, which were not yet fini&s;hed) by the
Situation and the Soil, that it required as many Men within to defend it,
as the Army &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of that be&s;ieged it; otherwi&s;e that it could
never hold out and endure a Siege of two Months: As it appeared clearly
by its having been taken and retaken &s;o many Times within the late
Years, in all which Times it never held out &s;o long, though there was
always an Army at no great Di&s;tance to relieve it.&endq;</P>
<P>(2.) &startq;THAT the Charge of keeping and maintaining it, without any
Accidents from the Attempt of an Enemy, did amount unto above one<MILESTONE N="50">
hundred and twenty thou&s;and Pounds by the Year, which was a Sum the
Revenue of the Crown could not &s;upply, without leaving many other Par|ticulars
of much more Importance unprovided for.&endq; And this was not
<PB N="203" REF="208">
lightly or cur&s;orily urged; but the State of the Revenue, and the con&s;tant
and indi&s;pen&s;able I&s;&s;ues, were at the &s;ame Time pre&s;ented and carefully
examined.</P>
<P>(3.) &startq;IT could not rea&s;onably be believed, but that if <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was
kept, his Maje&s;ty would be &s;hortly involved in a War with one of the
two Crowns. The <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour had already demanded Re&s;ti|tution
of it in Point of Ju&s;tice, it having been taken from his Ma&s;ter by
the late U&s;urper, in a Time when there was not only a Peace between
his Maje&s;ty and the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> but when his Maje&s;ty re&s;ided, and was
<MILESTONE N="10">entertained by the <HI>Catholick</HI> King, in <HI>Flanders:</HI> And at this Time both
<HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> inhibited their Subjects from paying tho&s;e &s;mall Contri|butions
to the Garri&s;on at <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and endeavoured to re&s;train the Go|vernour
him&s;elf from enjoying &s;ome Privileges, which had been always
enjoyed by him from the Time that it had been put into <HI>Cromwell's</HI>
Hands.&endq; And it was upon this and many other Rea&s;ons then conceived,
&startq;that as it would be very hard for the King to pre&s;erve a Neutrality to|wards
Both Crowns, even during the Time of the War between them&endq;
(which Temper was thought very nece&s;&s;ary for his Maje&s;ty's Affairs); &startq;&s;o
it would be much more difficult long to avoid a War with one of them
<MILESTONE N="20">upon the keeping <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> if the Peace that was newly made &s;hould re|main
firm and un&s;haken.&endq;</P>
<P>UPON the&s;e Rea&s;ons, urged and agreed upon by tho&s;e who could not but
be thought very competent Judges, in Re&s;pect of their &s;everal Profe&s;&s;ions and
great Experience,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King re|&s;olves to di&s;|po&s;e of it.</NOTE> the King re&s;olved to ea&s;e him&s;elf of the in&s;upportable Bur|den
of maintaining <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and to part with it in &s;uch a Manner as might
be mo&s;t for his Advantage and Benefit. There remained then no other
Que&s;tion, than into what Hand to put it: And the Mea&s;ure of that
was only who would give mo&s;t Money for it, there being no Inclination to
prefer one before another. It was enough under&s;tood, that Both Crowns
<MILESTONE N="30">would be very glad to have it, and would probably Both make large Offers for
it.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rea&s;ons for &s;elling it to</HI> France.</NOTE> But it was then as evident, that what&s;oever <HI>France</HI> &s;hould contract for, the
King would be &s;ure to receive, and the Bu&s;ine&s;s would be &s;oon di&s;patched:
Whereas on the other Hand it was as notorious and evident to his Maje&s;ty,
and to all who had any Knowledge of the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> and of the
Scarcity of Money there and in <HI>Flanders;</HI> that how large Offers &s;oever the
<HI>Spaniard</HI> might make, They could not be able in any Time to pay any
con&s;iderable Sum of Money; and that there would be &s;o much Time &s;pent
in Con&s;ult between <HI>Madrid</HI> and <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> before it could be di&s;patched, that
the keeping it &s;o long in his Maje&s;ty's Hands would in the Expen&s;e di&s;ap|point
<MILESTONE N="40">him of a good Part of the End in parting with it. Be&s;ides that it
&s;eemed at that Time probable, that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> would &s;hortly declare
him&s;elf an Enemy; for be&s;ides that He demanded <HI>Dunkirk</HI> as of Right, &s;o
He likewi&s;e required the Re&s;titution of <HI>Tangier</HI> and <HI>Jamaica</HI> upon the &s;ame
Rea&s;on, and declared &startq;that without it there could be no la&s;ting Peace be|tween
<HI>England</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI>&endq; and refu&s;ed &s;o much as to enter upon a
Treaty of Alliance with the King, before He &s;hould promi&s;e to make &s;uch
a Re&s;titution.</P>
<P>THERE wanted not in this Conference and Debate the Con&s;ideration
of the <HI>States</HI> of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> as Per&s;ons like enough to de&s;ire
<MILESTONE N="50">the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> from whence They had formerly received &s;o
much Damage, and were like enough to receive more whenever They
&s;hould be engaged in any War: And if in Truth They &s;hould have any
&s;uch De&s;ire, more Money might be rea&s;onably required and probably be
<PB N="204" REF="209">
obtained from them, than could be expected from either of the Kings. But
upon the Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of that Point, it did appear to every Man's Rea&s;on
very manife&s;t, that though They had rather that <HI>Dunkirk</HI> &s;hould be put
into the Hands of the <HI>Spaniard</HI> than delivered to <HI>France,</HI> or than it &s;hould
be detained by the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> yet They dur&s;t not receive it into their own
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which neither of the two Crowns would have approved of, and
&s;o it would have expo&s;ed them to the Di&s;plea&s;ure if not to the Ho&s;tility of
Both the Kings.</P>
<P>UPON this full Deliberation, his Maje&s;ty inclined rather to give it up to
<HI>France</HI> than to <HI>Spain;</HI> but deferred any po&s;itive Re&s;olution till He had im|parted<MILESTONE N="10">
the whole Matter to the Council-Board,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King re|fers it to the Privy Council.</NOTE> where the Debate was again re|&s;umed,
principally, &startq;whether it were more coun&s;ellable to keep it at &s;o va&s;t a
Charge, or to part with it for a good Sum of Money.&endq; And in that Debate
the Mention of what had been heretofore done in the Hou&s;e of Commons upon
that Subject was not omitted, nor the Bill that They had &s;ent up to the Hou&s;e
of Peers for annexing it in&s;eparably to the Crown: But that was not thought
of Moment; for as it had been &s;uddenly entertained in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons,
upon the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour's fir&s;t Propo&s;ition for the Re&s;titution,
&s;o it was looked upon in the Hou&s;e of Peers as unfit in it&s;elf, and &s;o laid
a&s;ide after once being read (which had been in the fir&s;t Convention &s;oon<MILESTONE N="20">
after the King's Return), and &s;o expired as &s;oon as it was born. After a
long Debate of the whole Matter at the Council-Board, where all was
averred concerning the U&s;ele&s;&s;ne&s;s and Weakne&s;s of the Place, by tho&s;e who
had &s;aid it at the Committee;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Where only one oppo&s;es it.</NOTE> there was but one Lord of the Council who
offered his Advice to the King again&s;t parting with it: And the Ground of
that Lord's di&s;&s;enting, who was the Earl of <HI>St. Albans,</HI> was enough under|&s;tood
to have Nothing of publick in it, but to draw the Negotiation for it
into his own Hands. In Conclu&s;ion, his Maje&s;ty re&s;olved to put it into the
Hands of <HI>France,</HI> if that King would comply with his Maje&s;ty's Expecta|tion
in the Payment of &s;o much Money as He would require for it: And a<MILESTONE N="30">
Way was found out, that the King might privately be adverti&s;ed of that
his Maje&s;ty's Re&s;olution, if He &s;hould have any De&s;ire to deal for it.</P>
<P>THE Adverti&s;ement was very welcome to the <HI>French</HI> King, who was
then re&s;olved to vi&s;it <HI>Flanders</HI> as &s;oon as He &s;hould know of the Death of
the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> which was expected every Day. Nor had He deferred
it till then, upon the late Affront his Amba&s;&s;adour had received at <HI>London</HI>
from the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour (who by a contrived and laboured Stratagem
had got the Precedence for his Coach before the other; which the King of
<HI>France</HI> received with that Indignation, that He &s;ent pre&s;ently to demand
Ju&s;tice at <HI>Madrid,</HI> commanded his Amba&s;&s;adour to retire from thence, and<MILESTONE N="40">
would not &s;uffer the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour to remain in <HI>Paris</HI> till He &s;hould
have Satisfaction, and was re&s;olved to have begun a War upon it), if the
King of <HI>Spain</HI> had not acknowledged the Fault of his Amba&s;&s;adour, and
under his Hand declared the Precedence to belong to <HI>France;</HI> which Decla|ration
was &s;ent to the Courts of all Princes: And &s;o for the pre&s;ent that Spark
of Fire was extingui&s;hed or rather raked up.</P>
<P>THE King &s;ent <HI>M. D'E&s;trades</HI> privately to <HI>London</HI> to treat about <HI>Dun|kirk,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mon&s;ieur D'E&s;trades <HI>comes over to treat about the Price.</HI></NOTE>
without any Character, but pretending to make it his Way to <HI>Holland,</HI>
whither He was de&s;igned Amba&s;&s;adour. After He had waited upon the
King, his Maje&s;ty appointed four or five of the Lords of his Council, whereof<MILESTONE N="50">
the Chancellor and Trea&s;urer and General were three, to treat with <HI>M. D'E&s;|trades</HI>
for the Sale of <HI>Dunkirk;</HI> when the fir&s;t Conference was &s;pent in en|deavouring
to per&s;uade him to make the fir&s;t Offer for the Price, which
<PB N="205" REF="210">
He could not be drawn to: So that the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners were obliged
to make their Demand. And They a&s;ked the Sum of &s;even hundred thou|&s;and
Pounds <HI>Sterling,</HI> to be paid upon the Delivery of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> and <HI>Mardike</HI>
into the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the King of <HI>France;</HI> which Sum appeared to him to
be &s;o &s;tupendous, that He &s;eemed to think the Treaty at an End, and re|&s;olved
to make no Offer at all on the Part of his Ma&s;ter. And &s;o the Con|ference
brake up.</P>
<P>AT the next Meeting He offered three Millions of <HI>Livres,</HI> which ac|cording
to the common Account amounted to three hundred thou&s;and <HI>Pi&s;|toles,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="10">which the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners as much undervalued; &s;o that any
farther Conference was di&s;continued, till He had &s;ent an Expre&s;s or two into
<HI>France,</HI> and till their Return: For as the Expectation of a great Sum of
ready Money was the King's Motive to part with it, be&s;ides the &s;aving
the monthly Charge; &s;o They concluded that his Nece&s;&s;ities would oblige
him to part with it at a moderate Price. And after the Return of the
Expre&s;&s;es, the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners in&s;i&s;ting &s;till upon what <HI>D'E&s;trades</HI>
thought too much, and He offering what They thought too little, the
Treaty &s;eemed to be at an End, and He prepared for his Return. In
Conclu&s;ion, his Maje&s;ty being fully as de&s;irous to part with it as the King
<MILESTONE N="20">of <HI>France</HI> could be to have it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Price a|greed upon.</NOTE> it was agreed and concluded, &startq;that upon

Per&s;ons as the King &s;hould appoint to receive it, his Maje&s;ty's Garri&s;on of
<HI>Dunkirk</HI> and <HI>Mardike</HI> &s;hould be withdrawn, and tho&s;e Places put into the
Hands of the King of <HI>France:</HI>&endq; All which was executed accordingly.
And without Doubt it was a greater Sum of Money than was ever paid at one
Payment by any Prince in <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> upon what Occa&s;ion &s;oever; and
every Body &s;eemed very glad to &s;ee &s;o va&s;t a Sum of Money delivered into
the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> as it was all together; the King at the &s;ame Time
declaring, &startq;that no Part of it &s;hould be applied to any ordinary Occa&s;ion,
<MILESTONE N="30">but be pre&s;erved for &s;ome pre&s;&s;ing Accident, as an In&s;urrection or the

<P>NOR was there the lea&s;t Murmur at this Bargain in all the Se&s;&s;ions of the
Parliament which &s;ate after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Vindication of the Chan|cellor in this Affair.</NOTE> until it fell out to &s;ome Mens Purpo&s;es to re|proach
the Chancellor: And then They charged him &startq;with advi&s;ing the
Sale of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and that the very Artillery, Ammunition and Stores
amounted to a greater Value than the King received for the Whole;&endq; when
upon an E&s;timate that had been taken of all tho&s;e, they were not e&s;teemed
to be more worth than twenty thou&s;and Pounds <HI>Sterling;</HI> and the Con&s;i|deration
of tho&s;e, when the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners in&s;i&s;ted upon their being
<MILESTONE N="40">all &s;hipped for <HI>England,</HI> and the Nece&s;&s;ity of keeping them upon the Place
where they were, had prevailed with <HI>M. D'E&s;trades</HI> to con&s;ent to that
Sum of five hundred thou&s;and <HI>Pi&s;toles.</HI> But whether the Bargain was ill or
well made, there could be no Fault imputed to the Chancellor, who had
no more to do in the Tran&s;action than is before &s;et down, the whole
Matter having been &s;o long deliberated and &s;o fully debated. Nor did He
ever before, or in, or after the Tran&s;action, receive the Value of Half a
Crown for Reward or Pre&s;ent, or any other Con&s;ideration relating to that
Affair: And the Treatment He received after his coming into <HI>France</HI>
was Evidence enough, that that King never thought him&s;elf beholden
<MILESTONE N="50">to him.</P>
<P>A LITTLE before this Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Queen Mother brings a natural Son of the King into</HI> England</NOTE> the Queen Mother returned again for <HI>England,</HI>
having di&s;bur&s;ed a great Sum of Money in making a noble Addition to her
Palace of <HI>Somer&s;et-Hou&s;e.</HI> With the Queen there came over a Youth of
<PB N="206" REF="211">
about ten or a dozen Years of Age, who was called by the Name of Mr.
<HI>Crofts,</HI> becau&s;e the Lord <HI>Crofts</HI> had been tru&s;ted to take Care of his Breed|ing;
but He was generally thought to be the King's Son, begotten upon a
private <HI>Welchwoman</HI> of no good Fame, but hand&s;ome, who had tran&s;ported
her&s;elf to the <HI>Hague,</HI> when the King was fir&s;t there, with a De&s;ign to ob|tain
that Honour, which a Groom of the Bedchamber willingly preferred
her to; and there it was this Boy was born. The Mother lived afterwards
for &s;ome Years in <HI>France</HI> in the King's Sight, and at la&s;t lo&s;t his Maje&s;ty's
Favour: Yet the King de&s;ired to have the Son delivered to him, that He
might take Care of his Education, which She would not con&s;ent to. At<MILESTONE N="10">
la&s;t the Lord <HI>Crofts</HI> got him into his Charge; and the Mother dying at
<HI>Paris,</HI> He had the &s;ole Tuition of him, and took Care for the breeding
him &s;uitable to the Quality of a very good Gentleman. And the Queen
after &s;ome Years came to know of it, and frequently had him brought to
her, and u&s;ed him with much Grace; and upon the King's De&s;ire brought
him with her from <HI>Paris</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> when He was about twelve Years
of Age, very hand&s;ome, and performed tho&s;e Exerci&s;es gracefully which
Youths of that Age u&s;ed to learn in <HI>France.</HI> The King received him with
extraordinary Fondne&s;s, and was willing that every Body &s;hould believe
him to be his Son, though He did not yet make any Declaration that He<MILESTONE N="20">
looked upon him as &s;uch, otherwi&s;e than by his Kindne&s;s and Familiarity
towards him. He a&s;&s;igned a liberal Maintenance for him; but took not
that Care for a &s;trict Breeding of him as his Age required.</P>
<P>THE General, during the Time of his Command in <HI>Scotland,</HI> had Ac|quaintance
with a Lady of much Honour there, the Counte&s;s of <HI>Weemes,</HI>
who had been before the Wife of the Earl of <HI>Buccleuch,</HI> and by him had
one only Daughter, who inherited his very great E&s;tate and Title, and was
called the Counte&s;s of <HI>Buccleuch,</HI> a Child of eight or ten Years of Age.
All Men believed, that the General's Purpo&s;e was to get this Lady for his
own Son, a Match &s;uitable enough: But the Time being now changed, the<MILESTONE N="30">
Lord <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> being a good Courtier, thought his Countrywoman
might be much better married, if She were given to the King for this
Youth, towards whom He expre&s;&s;ed &s;o much Fondne&s;s, tho&s;e Kinds of
Extractions carrying little Di&s;advantage with them in <HI>Scotland;</HI> and the Ge|neral,
whatever Thoughts He had before, would not be &s;o ill a Courtier
as not to advance &s;uch a Propo&s;ition. The Lady was already in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the greate&s;t Fortune in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which would have a fair Addition upon
the Death of her Mother.</P>
<P>THE King liked the Motion well; and &s;o the Mother was &s;ent to, to
bring up her Daughter to <HI>London,</HI> They being then Both in <HI>Scotland.</HI> And<MILESTONE N="40">
when They came, the King tru&s;ted the Earl of <HI>Lautherdale</HI> principally to
treat that Affair with the Mother, who had rather have been referred to any
other Body,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He is contract|ed to the Counte&s;s of</HI> Buccleuch.</NOTE> having indeed &s;ome ju&s;t Exceptions. They were Both yet
under the Years of Con&s;ent; but that Time drawing on, &s;uch a Contract
was drawn up as had been fir&s;t propo&s;ed to the King, which was, &startq;that
the whole E&s;tate, for Want of I&s;&s;ue by the young Lady, or by her Death,
&s;hould be devolved upon the young Man who was to marry her, and his
Heirs for ever; and that this &s;hould be &s;ettled by Act of Parliament in
<HI>Scotland.</HI>&endq; Matters being drawn to this Length, and Writings being to
be prepared, it was now nece&s;&s;ary that this young Gentleman mu&s;t have a<MILESTONE N="50">
Name, and the <HI>Scots</HI> Advocate had prepared a Draught, in which He was
&s;tyled the King's natural Son: And the King was every Day pre&s;&s;ed by the
great Lady, and tho&s;e young Men who knew the Cu&s;toms of <HI>France,</HI> to
<PB N="207" REF="212">
create him a Nobleman of <HI>England;</HI> and was indeed very willing to be
advi&s;ed to that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>TILL this Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King con|&s;ults the Chan|cellor about this Son.</NOTE> this whole Matter was treated in &s;ecret among&s;t the
<HI>Scots:</HI> But now the King thought fit to con&s;ult it with others; and telling
the Chancellor of all that had pa&s;t, &s;hewed him the Draught prepared by
the <HI>Scots</HI> Advocate, and a&s;ked him &startq;what He thought of it,&endq; and likewi&s;e
implied &startq;that He thought fit to give him &s;ome Title of Honour.&endq; After
He had read it over,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel|lor's Advice.</NOTE> He told his Maje&s;ty, &startq;that He need not give him any
other Title of Honour than He would enjoy by his Marriage, by which
<MILESTONE N="10">He would by the Law of <HI>Scotland</HI> be called Earl of <HI>Buccleuch,</HI> which
would be Title enough; and He de&s;ired his Maje&s;ty to pardon him, if
He found Fault with and di&s;liked the Title They had given him who
prepared that Draught, wherein They had pre&s;umed to &s;tyle him the
King's natural Son, which was never, at lea&s;t in many Ages, u&s;ed in
<HI>England,</HI> and would have an ill Sound in <HI>England</HI> with all his People,
who thought that tho&s;e unlawful Acts ought to be concealed, and not
publi&s;hed and ju&s;tified. That <HI>France</HI> indeed had, with Inconvenience
enough to the Crown, rai&s;ed &s;ome Families of tho&s;e Births; but it was
always from Women of great Quality, and who had never been tainted
<MILESTONE N="20">with any other Familiarity. And that there was another Circum&s;tance
required in <HI>Spain,</HI> which his Maje&s;ty &s;hould do well to ob&s;erve in this
Ca&s;e, if He had taken a Re&s;olution in the Main; which was, that the
King took Care for the good Education of that Child whom He believed
to be his, but never publickly owned or declared him to be &s;uch, till He
had given &s;ome notable Evidence of his inheriting or having acquired &s;uch
Virtues and Qualities, as made him in the Eyes of all Men worthy of
&s;uch a De&s;cent. That this Gentleman was yet young, and not yet to be
judged of: And therefore if He were for the pre&s;ent married to this
young Lady, and a&s;&s;umed her Title as He mu&s;t do, his Maje&s;ty might
<MILESTONE N="30">defer for &s;ome Years making any &s;uch Declaration; which He might do
when He would, and which at pre&s;ent would be as unpopular an Action
in the Hearts of his Subjects as He could commit.&endq;</P>
<P>THOUGH the King did not &s;eem to concur in all that was &s;aid, He did
not appear at all offended, and only a&s;ked him, &startq;whether He had not
conferred with the Queen his Mother upon that Subject.&endq; When He
a&s;&s;ured him &startq;He had not, nor with any other Per&s;on, and though He had
heard &s;ome general Di&s;cour&s;e of his Maje&s;ty's Purpo&s;e to make that Mar|riage,
He had never heard either of the other Particulars mentioned;&endq; the
King &s;aid, &startq;He had Rea&s;on to a&s;k the Que&s;tion, becau&s;e many of tho&s;e
<MILESTONE N="40">Things which He had &s;aid had been &s;poken to him by the Queen his Mo|ther,
who was entirely of his Opinion, which She u&s;ed not to be;&endq; and
concluded, &startq;that He would confer with them together,&endq; &s;eeming for the
pre&s;ent to be more moved and doubtful in the Matter of the Declaration,
than in the other of the Creation; and &s;aid, &startq;there was no Rea&s;on,
&s;ince She brought all the E&s;tate, that She &s;hould receive no Addition by
her Hu&s;band.&endq; The Queen afterwards took an Occa&s;ion to &s;peak at large
to the Chancellor of it with much Warmth, and Manife&s;tation that She did
not like it. But the King &s;pake with neither of them afterwards upon it,
but &s;igned the Declaration,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King pub|lickly owns his Son, and creates him Duke of</HI> Mon|mouth.</NOTE> and created him to be Duke of <HI>Monmouth;</HI>
<MILESTONE N="50">very few Per&s;ons di&s;&s;uading it, and the Lady employing all her Cre|dit
to bring it to pa&s;s: And the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> (who in tho&s;e difficult
Ca&s;es was u&s;ually con&s;ulted) pre&s;&s;ed it as the only Way to make the King's
Friend&s;hip valuable.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="213">
SINCE the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> is mentioned upon this Occa&s;ion, it will not be
un&s;ea&s;onable to give him the next Part in this Relation. Though He had
left no Way unattempted to render him&s;elf gracious to the King, by &s;aying
and doing all that might be acceptable unto him, and contriving &s;uch
Meetings and Jollities as He was plea&s;ed with; and though his Maje&s;ty had
been &s;everal Ways very bountiful to him, and had particularly given him at one
Time ten thou&s;and Pounds in Money, with which He had purcha&s;ed <HI>Wim|bleton</HI>
of the Queen, and had given him <HI>A&s;hdown-Fore&s;t</HI> and other Lands
in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex:</HI> Yet He found He had not that Degree of Favour and Intere&s;t
in the King's Affections, as He de&s;ired, or de&s;ired that other People &s;hould<MILESTONE N="10">
think He had. The Change of his Religion kept him from being admitted
to the Council, or to any Employment of Moment. And whereas He made
no Doubt of drawing the whole Dependance of the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> upon
him&s;elf, and to have the Di&s;po&s;al of that Intere&s;t, and to that Purpo&s;e had
the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> firm to him; He found that He had no Kind of Credit with
them, nor was admitted by them to their mo&s;t &s;ecret Con&s;ultations, and
that the Fathers of the Society had more Enemies than Friends among&s;t the
<HI>Catholicks.</HI></P>
<P>HIS E&s;tate had been &s;old and &s;ettled by his own Con&s;ent, upon the
Marriage of his elde&s;t Son twice to great Fortunes: So that when He re|turned<MILESTONE N="20">
from beyond the Seas, He could not return to his E&s;tate as others
did, and had little more to &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon than the King's Bounty; and that
was not poured out upon him in the Mea&s;ure He wi&s;hed, though few Per|&s;ons
ta&s;ted more of it. He was in his Nature very covetous, and ready to
embrace all Ways that were offered to get Money, whether honourable or
no, for He had not a great Power over him&s;elf, and could not bear Want,
which He could hardly avoid, for He was nothing provident in his Ex|pen&s;es,
when He had any Temptation from his Ambition or Vanity. Be|&s;ides,
his Appetitite to Play and Gaming, in which He had no Skill, and by
which He had all his Life &s;pent whatever He could get, was not at all<MILESTONE N="30">
abated. He &s;pent as much Money at <HI>Wimbleton</HI> in building and garden|ing,
as the Land was worth.</P>
<P>BY all the&s;e Means He found him&s;elf in Streights, which He could nei|ther
endure nor get from, and which tran&s;ported him to that Degree, that
He re&s;olved to treat the King in another Manner than He had ever yet pre|&s;umed
to do. And having a&s;ked &s;omewhat of him that his Maje&s;ty did
not think fit to grant,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Bri&s;tol's <HI>ex|travagant Be|haviour to the King.</HI></NOTE> He told him, &startq;He knew well the Cau&s;e of his with|drawing

had done. He &s;aid many Truths which ought to have been more mo|de&s;tly
and decently mentioned, and all this in the Pre&s;ence of the Lord
<HI>Aubigny,</HI> who was as much &s;urpri&s;ed as the King; and concluded, &startq;that if
He did not give him Satisfaction within &s;uch a Time&endq; (the Time allowed
did not exceed four and twenty Hours), &startq;He would do &s;omewhat that
would awaken him out of his Slumber, and make him look better to his
own Bu&s;ine&s;s;&endq; and added many Threats again&s;t the Chancellor. The
King &s;tood all this Time in &s;uch Confu&s;ion, that though He gave him
more &s;harp Words than were natural to him, He had not that Pre&s;entne&s;s<MILESTONE N="50">
of Mind (as He afterwards accu&s;ed him&s;elf) as He ought to have had; and
&s;aid, &startq;He ought pre&s;ently to have called for the Guard,&endq; it being in his

<P><PB N="209" REF="214">
THE Court and the Town was full of the Di&s;cour&s;e that the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI>
would accu&s;e the Chancellor of High Trea&s;on, who knew Nothing of what
had pa&s;&s;ed with the King. And it &s;eems when the Time was pa&s;&s;ed that
He pre&s;cribed to the King to give him Satisfaction, He came one Morning
to the Hou&s;e of Peers with a Paper in his Hand; and told the Lords,
that He could not but ob&s;erve,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He accu&s;es the Chancel|lor of High Trea&s;on.</NOTE> that after &s;o glorious a Return with which
God had ble&s;&s;ed the King and the Nation, &s;o that all the World had ex|pected,
that the Pro&s;perity of the Kingdom would have far exceeded the
Mi&s;ery and Adver&s;ity that it had for many Years endured; and after
<MILESTONE N="10">the Parliament had contributed more towards it, than ever Parliament had
done: Notwith&s;tanding all which, it was evident to all Men, and la|mented
by tho&s;e who wi&s;hed well to his Maje&s;ty, that his Affairs grew
every Day wor&s;e and wor&s;e; the King him&s;elf lo&s;t much of his Honour,
and the Affection He had in the Hearts of the People. That for his
Part He looked upon it with as much Sadne&s;s as any Man, and had made
Enquiry as well as He could from whence this great Misfortune, which
every Body was &s;en&s;ible of, could proceed; and that He was &s;atisfied in
his own Con&s;cience, that it proceeded principally from the Power and
Credit and &s;ole Credit of the Chancellor: And therefore He was re&s;olved, for
<MILESTONE N="20">the Good of his Country, to accu&s;e the Lord Chancellor of High Trea&s;on;
which He had done in the Paper which He de&s;ired might be read, all
written with his own Hand, to which He &s;ub&s;cribed his Name.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Paper contained many Articles, which He called <HI>Articles of High
Trea&s;on and other Mi&s;demeanors;</HI> among&s;t which one was, &startq;that He had
per&s;uaded the King to &s;end a Gentleman (a Creature of his own) to <HI>Rome</HI>
with Letters to the Pope, to give a Cardinal's Cap to the Lord <HI>Aubigny,</HI>
who was Almoner to the Queen.&endq; The re&s;t contained &startq;his a&s;&s;uming to
him&s;elf the Government of all publick Affairs, which He had admi|ni&s;tered
un&s;kilfully, corruptly and traiterou&s;ly; which He was ready
<MILESTONE N="30">to prove.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Chancellor, without any Trouble in his Countenance, told the
Lords, &startq;that He had had the Honour heretofore to have &s;o much the good
Opinion and Friend&s;hip of that Lord, that He dur&s;t appeal to his own
Con&s;cience, that He did not him&s;elf believe one of tho&s;e Articles to be
true, and knew the contrary of mo&s;t of them. And He was glad to find
that He thought it &s;o high a Crime to &s;end to <HI>Rome,</HI> and to de&s;ire a Car|dinal's
Cap for a Catholick Lord, who had been always bred from his
Cradle in that Faith: But He did a&s;&s;ure them, that that Gentleman was
only &s;ent by the Queen to the Pope, upon an Affair that She thought
<MILESTONE N="40">her&s;elf obliged to comply with him in, and in Hope to do &s;ome good Of|fice
to <HI>Portugal;</HI> and that the King had neither writ to the Pope, nor to
any other Per&s;on in <HI>Rome.</HI>&endq; He &s;pake at large to mo&s;t of the Articles,
to &s;hew the Impo&s;&s;ibility of their being true, and that they reflected more
upon the King's Honour than upon his; and concluded, &startq;that He was
&s;orry that Lord had not been better advi&s;ed, for He did believe that
though all that was alleged in the Articles &s;hould be true, they would
not all amount to High Trea&s;on, upon which He de&s;ired the Judges
might be required to deliver their Opinion;&endq; the which the Lords or|dered
the Judges to do. It was moved by one of the Lords, &startq;that the
<MILESTONE N="50">Copy of the Articles might be &s;ent to the King, becau&s;e He was men|tioned
&s;o pre&s;umptuou&s;ly in them;&endq; which was likewi&s;e agreed; and the

<P>BUT from that Day He made no farther In&s;tance:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Bri&s;tol <HI>ab|&s;conds upon the King's Warrant to apprehend him.</HI></NOTE> And under&s;tanding<MILESTONE N="40">
that the King had given Warrants to a Sergeant at Arms to apprehend
him, He concealed him&s;elf in &s;everal Places for the Space of near two
Years; &s;ending &s;ometimes Letters and Petitions by his Wife to the King,
who would not receive them. But in the End his Maje&s;ty was prevailed
with by the Lady and Sir <HI>Harry Bennet</HI> to &s;ee him in private; but would
not admit him to come to the Court, nor repeal his Warrants for his Ap|prehen&s;ion:
So that He appeared not publickly till the Chancellor's Mi&s;|fortune;
and then He came to the Court and to the Parliament in great
Triumph, and &s;hewed a more impotent Malice than was expected from his
Genero&s;ity and Under&s;tanding.<MILESTONE N="50"></P>
<P>WE &s;hall in the next Place take a View of <HI>Scotland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Affairs of</HI> Scotland.</NOTE> whither We left
<HI>Middleton</HI> &s;ent the King's Commi&s;&s;ioner, who performed his Part with won|derful
Dexterity and Conduct, and with more Succe&s;s than &s;ome of his Coun|trymen
<PB N="211" REF="216">
were plea&s;ed with. We have remembered before the Debate upon
his In&s;tructions, and the earne&s;t Advice and Caution given by <HI>Lauther|dale</HI>
again&s;t any ha&s;ty Attempt to make Alteration in the Matters of
the Church, which was at la&s;t left to the Di&s;cretion of the Commi&s;&s;ioner,
to proceed in &s;uch a Manner, and at &s;uch a Time, as He found mo&s;t con|venient.
As &s;oon as He came thither,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Commi&s;|&s;ioner well re|ceived.</NOTE> He found him&s;elf received with
as univer&s;al an Exclamation, and the King's Authority as cheerfully &s;ub|mitted
to, as can be imagined or could be wi&s;hed; and &s;uch a Con&s;ent to
every Thing He propo&s;ed, that He made no Que&s;tion but any Thing his
<MILESTONE N="10">Maje&s;ty required would find an entire Obedience. The Earl of <HI>Glencarne</HI>
who was Chancellor, and the Earl of <HI>Rothes,</HI> and all the Nobility of any
Intere&s;t or Credit, were not only faithful to the King but fa&s;t Friends to
<HI>Middleton,</HI> and magnified his Conduct in all their Letters.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Crawford</HI> alone who was Trea&s;urer, which is an Office
that cannot be unattended by a great Faction in that Kingdom, retained
&s;till his rigid Affection for the Pre&s;bytery, when the Mini&s;ters them&s;elves
grew much le&s;s rigid, and were even a&s;hamed of the many Follies and
Madne&s;&s;es They had committed. But the Earl of <HI>Crawford</HI> did all He
could to rai&s;e their Spirits, and to keep them firm to the Kirk. In all
<MILESTONE N="20">other Particulars He was full of Devotion to the King, being entirely of the
Faction of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and nearly allied to it; and when the King was in
<HI>Scotland</HI> had &s;erved him &s;ignally, and had then been made by him High
Trea&s;urer of that Kingdom; and upon <HI>Cromwell's</HI> prevailing and Conjunc|tion
with <HI>Argyle,</HI> was as odious as any Man to them Both, and had for
many Years been Pri&s;oner in <HI>England</HI> till the Time of the King's Return.
There was always a great Friend&s;hip between him and <HI>Lautherdale;</HI> the
former being a Man of much the greater Intere&s;t, and of unque&s;tionable
Courage; the other excelling him in all the Faculties which are nece&s;&s;ary
to Bu&s;ine&s;s, and being a Ma&s;ter in Di&s;&s;imulation.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30">MIDDLETON, and the Lords who went with him, and the General (upon
who&s;e Advice the King depended as much in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Scotland</HI>)
were all earne&s;t with his Maje&s;ty to remove the Earl of <HI>Crawford</HI> from
that great Office, which would enable him to do Mi&s;chief. But the
King's good Nature prevailed over him, though He knew him as well as
They did: And He thought it too hardhearted a Thing to remove a
Man, whom He found a Pri&s;oner for his Service, from an Office He had
formerly conferred upon him for his Merit, and which He had not for|feited
by any Mi&s;carriage. And it may be it was &s;ome Argument to him
of his Sincerity, that when others, who to his Maje&s;ty's own Knowledge
<MILESTONE N="40">were as rigid <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> as He, were now very frank in renouncing and
di&s;claiming all Obligations from it, He of all the Nobility was the only
Man who &s;till adhered to it, when it was evident to him that He &s;hould
upon the Matter be undone by it. However the King &s;ent him down with
the re&s;t into <HI>Scotland,</HI> being confident that He would do Nothing to di&s;|&s;erve
him, as in Truth He never did; and re&s;olved that, when the Bu&s;ine&s;s
of the Church came to be agitated, if He did continue &s;till refractory, He
would take the Staff from him, and confer it upon <HI>Middleton:</HI> Who,
though all Things were very fair between him and <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> to whom
all his Di&s;patches mu&s;t be addre&s;&s;ed, yet depended more upon tho&s;e of
<MILESTONE N="50">the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Council, to whom the King had required the Secretary to
communicate all that He received from the Commi&s;&s;ioner, and all the
Di&s;patches which He &s;hould make to him. And by this Means no Or|ders
were &s;ent from the King which re&s;trained him from proceeding in the
<PB N="212" REF="217">
Matter of the Church according to Di&s;cretion, as He was appointed by his
In&s;tructions; though <HI>Lautherdale</HI> did not di&s;&s;emble, when Letters came
from <HI>Scotland</HI> &startq;of the good Po&s;ture the King's Affairs were in there, and
that any Thing might be brought to pa&s;s that He de&s;ired,&endq; to receive
other Letters to which He gave more Credit; and was &s;till as &s;olicitous that
Nothing might be attempted with Reference to the Kirk.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Parliament was convened at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Proceedings of the</HI> Scotch <HI>Parliament.</HI></NOTE> and the Com|mi&s;&s;ioner
found the Temper of them to be &s;uch as He could wi&s;h, the
Marquis of <HI>Argyle</HI> (who had been &s;ent by Sea from the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London</HI> to
<HI>Leith</HI>) was brought to his Trial upon many Articles of Trea&s;on and Mur|der;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> Argyle <HI>tried, condemned and executed.</HI></NOTE><MILESTONE N="10">
wherein all his Confederacies with <HI>Cromwell</HI> were laid open, and much
in&s;i&s;ted upon to prove his being privy to the Re&s;olution of taking the King's
Life, and advi&s;ing it: And though there was great Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect it,
and mo&s;t Men believed it, the Proofs were not clear enough to convict
him. But then the Evidence was &s;o full and clear of &s;o many horrid Mur|ders
committed by his Order upon Per&s;ons in his Di&s;plea&s;ure, and his im|mediate
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing him&s;elf of their E&s;tates, and other mon&s;trous and un|heard
of Acts of Oppre&s;&s;ion; that the Parliament condemned him to be
hanged upon a Gallows of an unu&s;ual Height, and in or near the Place
where He had cau&s;ed the Marquis of <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> to be formerly executed:<MILESTONE N="20">
All which was performed the &s;ame Day with the univer&s;al Joy of the Peo|ple;
the unfortunate Per&s;on him&s;elf &s;hewing more Re&s;olution and Courage
than was expected from him, and expre&s;&s;ing much Affection and Zeal for
the <HI>Covenant,</HI> for which He de&s;ired all Men &s;hould believe He was put to
Death.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gila&s;py <HI>a Fa|natick exe|cuted.</HI></NOTE> There was likewi&s;e one &s;editious Preacher, <HI>Gila&s;py,</HI> who had
been a notorious and malicious Rebel again&s;t the la&s;t and the pre&s;ent King,
underwent the &s;ame Trial and Judgment, with the &s;ame Faith in the <HI>Cove|nant,</HI>
and without Shew of Repentance. And it was much wondered at,
that no more of that Tribe, which had kindled the Fire that had almo&s;t
burned two Kingdoms, and never had endeavoured to extingui&s;h it, were<MILESTONE N="30">
ever brought to Ju&s;tice; and that the Lives of two Men &s;hould be thought
a &s;ufficient Sacrifice for that Kingdom to offer for all the Mi&s;chief it
had done.</P>
<P>WHEN this Work was done, the Parliament without He&s;itation repealed
all tho&s;e Acts prejudicial to the Crown and the Royal Dignity, which had
been made &s;ince the Beginning of the Rebellion, and upon which all the
Rebellions had been founded; and branded their beloved <HI>Covenant</HI> with all
the Reproaches it de&s;erved, and this even with the Con&s;ent and Approba|tion
of the General A&s;&s;embly of the Kirk. By all which the Ob&s;tructions
were removed; and it was now in the Power of the King to make Bi&s;hops<MILESTONE N="40">
as heretofore, and to &s;ettle the Church in the &s;ame Government to which
it had formerly been &s;ubject. But the Commi&s;&s;ioner thought not this
enough; and apprehended that the King might yet be per&s;uaded, though
there was no &s;uch Appearance, &startq;that the People were again&s;t it, and that
it would be better to defer it:&endq;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment petition the King to re&s;tere Epi&s;copacy.</NOTE> And therefore the Parliament prepared a

brought their wicked Devices to pa&s;s; and therefore They were humble
Suitors to his Maje&s;ty, &startq;that He would make Choice of &s;uch grave Di|vines,

AND the Commi&s;&s;ioner having declared that He meant to prorogue the
Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They prepare an Abjuration of the</HI> Cove|nant.</NOTE> They appointed a Draught of an Oath or Sub&s;cription to be

of a Church or any other Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Promotion in that Kingdom,
&s;hould be bound to renounce the <HI>Covenant</HI> upon the Penalty of being

<P>THEY &s;ettled a &s;tanding Militia of forty thou&s;and Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And &s;ettle a &s;tanding Force.</NOTE> to be always
<MILESTONE N="10">ready to march upon the King's Orders; and rai&s;ed two good Troops of
Hor&s;e, and provided for the Payment of them; and granted &s;uch a Sum of
Money to the King, as could be rea&s;onably expected from &s;o poor and har|ra&s;&s;ed
a Country, and which would &s;erve the de&s;raying the nece&s;&s;ary Ex|pen&s;es
thereof. And all this being done, and the Prorogation made, the
Commi&s;&s;ioner and &s;ome of the other Lords came to <HI>London</HI> to ki&s;s the
King's Hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Commi&s;|&s;ioner returns to</HI> London.</NOTE> and to receive his farther Directions, having &s;o fully di&s;|patched
all his former Orders. They brought likewi&s;e with them &s;ome
other Propo&s;itions, which will be mentioned anon.</P>
<P>THE King received the Commi&s;&s;ioner with open Arms, and was very
<MILESTONE N="20">well plea&s;ed with all that He had done; and Nobody &s;eemed to magnify it
more than <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> who was lea&s;t &s;atisfied with it. Nor could He
now longer oppo&s;e the making of Bi&s;hops there: So having pre&s;ented the
Names of &s;uch Per&s;ons to the King who were thought fit to be con&s;ecrated
Bi&s;hops, whereof &s;ome had been with his Maje&s;ty abroad, They were all
&s;ent for to <HI>London;</HI> and &s;uch of them who had not before received their

Prie&s;t from the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> and were afterwards con&s;ecrated in the
u&s;ual Form by the Bi&s;hops who were then near the Town, and made &s;o
<MILESTONE N="30">great a Fea&s;t as if it had been at the Charge of their Country.</P>
<P>THE Commi&s;&s;ioner, the Chancellor, the Earl of <HI>Rothes</HI> and others, with
the Lord <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> were deputed by the Parliament to be humble Suitors
to the King; &startq;&s;ince They had performed on their Part all that was of the
Duty of good Subjects, and were ready to give any other Te&s;timony of
their Obedience that his Maje&s;ty would require; and &s;ince the whole
Kingdom was entirely at his Devotion, and in &s;uch a Po&s;ture that They
were able as well as willing to pre&s;erve the Peace thereof, and to &s;uppre&s;s
any &s;editious Party that &s;hould attempt any Di&s;turbance; that his Ma|je&s;ty
would now remove the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Garri&s;ons from thence,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Scotch <HI>de&s;ire the</HI> Eng|li&s;h Garri&s;ons may be <HI>with|drawn.</HI></NOTE> and permit
<MILESTONE N="40">the Fortifications and Works, which had been erected at a va&s;t Charge,
to be demoli&s;hed, that there might remain no Monuments of the Slavery
They had undergone.&endq; And this They demanded as in Ju&s;tice due to
them, &startq;&s;ince there were few Men now alive, none in the lea&s;t Power, who
had contributed to the Ills which had been committed; and all the Men
of Power had undergone for ten or a dozen Years as great Oppre&s;&s;ion as
could be put upon them, becau&s;e They would not renounce their Fide|lity
to the King: And &s;ince it had plea&s;ed God to re&s;tore his Maje&s;ty,
They hoped He would not continue tho&s;e Yokes and Shackles upon them,
which had been prepared and put upon them to keep them from return|ing
<MILESTONE N="50">to their Allegiance.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS was propo&s;ed in the Pre&s;ence of tho&s;e of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Council, who
had been formally admitted to be of the Council of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and conti|nued
to meet upon that Affair. The <HI>Scots</HI> Lords enlarged with much
<PB N="214" REF="219">
Warmth &startq;upon the intolerable Oppre&s;&s;ion that Nation had undergone, on
the Poverty They &s;till &s;uffered, and the Impo&s;&s;ibility of being able to
bear any Part of the Charge, and the Jealou&s;y that it would keep up be|tween
the Nations, which could not be to the King's Profit and Conve|nience.&endq;
They had privately &s;poken before with the King upon it, and
had prevailed with him to think what They de&s;ired had Rea&s;on and Ju&s;|tice
in it; and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lords could not upon the &s;udden, and with|out
Conference together, re&s;olve what was fit for them to &s;ay: So that
They de&s;ired, without expre&s;&s;ing any Inclination in the Matter, &startq;that the
Debate might be put off to another Day;&endq; which the <HI>Scots</HI> took very<MILESTONE N="10">
ill, as if the very deferring it were an Argument that They thought it might
be denied. But when They &s;aw They would not pre&s;ently &s;peak to it,
They were content that another Day &s;hould be appointed for the Con&s;ide|ration
of it: And They afterwards de&s;ired the King, &startq;that He would call
the Committee of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Council, who u&s;ed to attend him in the
mo&s;t &s;ecret Affairs, to con&s;ult what was to be done.&endq; Nobody could
deny but that the <HI>Scots</HI> had Rea&s;on to demand it. And They who thought
it a Bridle fit to keep in their Mouths, to re&s;train them from future Rebel|lions
which They might be inclined to, could not ea&s;ily re&s;olve what An|&s;wer
&s;hould be given to them in the Negative. And They who thought<MILESTONE N="20">
the Demand to be &s;o ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, and &s;o much for the King's Be|nefit
and Advantage, that it ought to be granted, did believe likewi&s;e that
it was a Thing &s;o capable of Cen&s;ure and Reproach, in Regard of the ge|neral
Prejudice which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have again&s;t that People, that no parti|cular
Per&s;on was able to bear the Odium of the Advice; nor that the King
him&s;elf &s;hould take the Re&s;olution upon him&s;elf without very mature De|liberation.</P>
<P>THAT which advanced the Propo&s;ition as fit to be granted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some Circum|&s;tances that facilitate their Reque&s;t.</NOTE> was the
Charge of maintaining tho&s;e Forces; which that Kingdom was &s;o incapable
of bearing, that <HI>Middleton</HI> and <HI>Glencarne</HI> (who&s;e Duties and entire Devo|tion<MILESTONE N="30">
to the King were above all Exception or Su&s;picion) declared not only
to the King, but to tho&s;e of the Lords with whom They would confer
freely, &startq;that if the King thought it nece&s;&s;ary to keep that People &s;till
there, He mu&s;t &s;end more Forces of Hor&s;e and Foot thither; otherwi&s;e
They were not &s;trong enough to &s;ubdue the whole Kingdom, but would
as &s;oon as They &s;tirred out of their Garri&s;ons be knocked in the Head;
nor would the Country pay any Thing towards their Support, but
what &s;hould be extorted by Force: So that his Maje&s;ty would not be
thought to po&s;&s;e&s;s that Kingdom in Peace, which otherwi&s;e He would
unque&s;tionably do.&endq;<MILESTONE N="40"></P>
<P>AND this Con&s;ideration was improved by the Reflection upon the Body of
Men of which tho&s;e Forces con&s;i&s;ted, which was a Parcel of the wor&s;t affected
Men to the King of the whole Army, and which the General had therefore
left in <HI>Scotland,</HI> when He marched into <HI>England,</HI> under the Command of
Major General <HI>Morgan</HI> (who was worthy of any Tru&s;t), becau&s;e He was
not &s;ure enough of their Fidelity to take them with him, yet thought them &s;it
enough to be left to re&s;train the <HI>Scots</HI> from any &s;udden In&s;urrection. But now
They &s;aw all their Model brought to Confu&s;ion, They were not &s;o much above
Temptation, but that They might, e&s;pecially if They were drawn together,
concur in any de&s;perate De&s;ign with a di&s;contented Party in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or<MILESTONE N="50">
with their Brethren of the di&s;banded Army of <HI>England,</HI> who at that Sea|&s;on
had rebellious Re&s;olutions in the <HI>North.</HI> And which was of no &s;mall
Importance, there was at this very Time an Opportunity to tran&s;port all
<PB N="215" REF="220">
tho&s;e Forces (the very di&s;banding wherof would not be without Danger for
the Rea&s;ons afore&s;aid) to <HI>Portugal,</HI> in Compliance with the King's Obliga|tion
upon his Marriage.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, it was very notorious that the People generally through|out
<HI>England,</HI> of what Quality &s;oever, a few <HI>London Pre&s;byterians</HI> ex|cepted,
were marvellou&s;ly plea&s;ed to &s;ee the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;o admirably cha&s;ti&s;ed and
yoked; nor had <HI>Cromwell</HI> ever done an Act that more reconciled the Af|fections
of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to him, than his mo&s;t rigorous Treatment of that
Nation: And They never contributed Money &s;o willingly towards any of
<MILESTONE N="10">his De&s;igns, as for the erecting tho&s;e Forts in the &s;everal Quarters of the
Kingdom; which, with a little Addition of Force, They had good Expe|rience
would &s;uffice to keep it from giving any Di&s;turbance to their Neigh|bours.
And the demoli&s;hing all tho&s;e Structures in one In&s;tant, and leav|ing
an unquiet and an impoveri&s;hed People to their own Inclinations, could
not be grateful.</P>
<P>THE King had, during the Time that He re&s;ided in <HI>Scotland</HI> before his
March to <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> contracted, and had brought with him from thence,
a perfect Dete&s;tation of their Kirk and Pre&s;byterian Government, and a
great Prejudice again&s;t the whole Family of <HI>Argyle</HI> and &s;ome other Per&s;ons.
<MILESTONE N="20">But He was exceedingly reconciled to the Nation; and be&s;ides the E&s;teem
He had of the Per&s;ons of very many Noblemen, He did really believe the
Burge&s;&s;es and common People to be as heartily affected to him, and as
much at his Di&s;po&s;al, as any Subjects He had. And the Lord <HI>Lautherdale</HI>
cultivated this gracious Credulity with &s;o much Diligence, that He a&s;&s;ured
the King, &startq;that He might depend upon the whole <HI>Scots</HI> Nation as upon one
Man, to be employed in his Service and Commands of what Kind &s;oever,
and again&s;t what Enemy &s;oever.&endq;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King for it.</NOTE> His Maje&s;ty upon the Debate of this Bu&s;i|ne&s;s
declared, &startq;that He did not only think it good Hu&s;bandry in Re&s;pect of
the Expen&s;e, and good Policy, that He might keep <HI>Scotland</HI> entirely at his
<MILESTONE N="30">Devotion, whil&s;t <HI>Ireland</HI> remained in this Confu&s;ion, and <HI>England</HI> it&s;elf
was threatened by &s;uch Factions in Religion, to gratify them in what They
de&s;ired; but that He held him&s;elf obliged in Honour, Ju&s;tice and Con|&s;cience,
to &s;end all the Forces out of that Kingdom, and to deface the
Monuments of that Time: And that there would be no more to be con|&s;ulted,
but what to do with tho&s;e Forces&endq; (which was quickly re&s;olved,
that They &s;hould be all &s;ent for <HI>Portugal;</HI> and Order was pre&s;ently given
for Ships upon which They were to be embarked), &startq;and then to con&s;ider in
what Method the other &s;hould be done.&endq;</P>
<P>THE <HI>Scots</HI> were very well &s;atisfied with the King's Re&s;olution upon the

that the Privy Council fir&s;t, &startq;and then the Parliament, &s;hould be informed
of his Maje&s;ty's Intentions: Which,&endq; They &s;aid, &startq;would be again&s;t the
Honour and the Intere&s;t and the Right of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which never &s;ubmitted

and the Innovation would be no le&s;s in remitting it to the Parlia|ment,
which had no Pretence of Juri&s;diction over them.&endq; To Both which

or Cen&s;ures, which otherwi&s;e might ari&s;e.&endq; The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lords de|&s;ired,

what They found convenient; and many did &s;ince believe, that there

hereafter.</P>
<P>THE King appointed the Chancellor to make a Relation, at a Conference
between the two Hou&s;es of Parliament, &startq;of the good Po&s;ture his Maje&s;ty's<MILESTONE N="10">
Affairs of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;tood in; of their having repealed all tho&s;e ill Laws
which had been made by the Advantage of the Rebellion, and all that
concerned the Church; upon which that his Maje&s;ty forthwith re&s;olved to
&s;ettle Bi&s;hops in that Kingdom, which appeared very unanimou&s;ly devoted
to his Service: And that the King could not but communicate this good
News to them, which He knew would give them Cau&s;e of rejoicing.&endq;
And then He told them, &startq;that the <HI>Scots</HI> Parliament, in Regard of the Peace
and Quiet that They enjoyed, without the lea&s;t Apprehen&s;ion of Trouble
from abroad or at Home, had de&s;ired the King, <HI>that the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Forces
might be withdrawn and all the Fortifications razed;</HI> and that tho&s;e Forces<MILESTONE N="20">
might be convenient, if his Maje&s;ty thought fit, to be tran&s;ported to <HI>Por|tugal;</HI>&endq;
without di&s;covering what his Maje&s;ty had re&s;olved to do,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Parliament do not oppo&s;e it.</HI></NOTE> or a&s;k|ing
any Opinion from them, which however They might have given if
They plea&s;ed. The Effect was, that Both Hou&s;es &s;ent their humble Thanks
to the King &startq;for his having vouch&s;afed to let them know the good Condi|tion
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> of which They wi&s;hed his Maje&s;ty much Joy; and hoped
his other Dominions would in a &s;hort Time be in the &s;ame Tranquillity:&endq;
Without taking any Notice of withdrawing the Garri&s;ons. And &s;o that
Affair ended.</P>
<P>DURING this Agitation in <HI>London,</HI> it was di&s;cernable enough that there<MILESTONE N="30">
were great Jealou&s;ies between the <HI>Scots</HI> Lords. The Commi&s;&s;ioner and
the other had Cau&s;e to believe, that the King gave much more Credit to
<HI>Lautherdale</HI> than to them, and looked upon him as a Man of great Intere&s;t
in that Country, when They knew He had none, being neither in his Qua|lity
or Fortune among&s;t tho&s;e who were e&s;teemed Men of Power and De|pendance.
And He thought them linked in a Faction again&s;t him, to le&s;&s;en
the Value the King had of him, which indeed was the Foundation of all
his Credit and Intere&s;t. What Countenance &s;oever He &s;et upon it, He was
&s;en&s;ibly afflicted at the Downfal of the Pre&s;bytery, and that <HI>Middleton</HI> had
brought that to pa&s;s without any Difficulty (as He had before told the King<MILESTONE N="40">
He would), which He had a&s;&s;ured his Maje&s;ty was impo&s;&s;ible to be effected
but in long Time and by many Stratagems.</P>
<P>THE Marquis of <HI>Argyle</HI> had been a Man univer&s;ally odious to the
whole Nation, &s;ome Mini&s;ters and Preachers excepted: And there had been
always thought to have been an implacable Animo&s;ity from <HI>Lautherdale</HI>
towards him; and after the King's Return no Man had appeared more
again&s;t him, nor more in&s;i&s;ted upon his not being admitted to his Maje&s;ty's
Pre&s;ence, or for his being &s;ent into <HI>Scotland</HI> to be tried. Yet after all this
it was di&s;covered, that He had interpo&s;ed all He could with his Maje&s;ty to
&s;ave him, and employed all his Intere&s;t in <HI>Scotland</HI> to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e.<MILESTONE N="50">
And the Marquis was no &s;ooner executed, but the Earl of <HI>Lautherdale</HI> had
prevailed with the King immediately to give his Son the Lord <HI>Lorne</HI> (who
<PB N="217" REF="222">
had remained in <HI>London</HI> to &s;olicit on his Father's Behalf) Leave to ki&s;s his
Hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lord</HI> Lorne <HI>re&s;tored, and created Earl of</HI> Argyle.</NOTE> and to create him Earl of <HI>Argyle,</HI> and to confer on him the Office
of General Ju&s;tice in the <HI>Highlands,</HI> by which his Father had been qualified
to do mo&s;t of the Wickedne&s;&s;es He had committed; all which the Parlia|ment
of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould have treated as the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Affront to them
that They could undergo.</P>
<P>IT was well known that this young Man, who was Captain of the King's
Guard when He was in <HI>Scotland,</HI> had treated his Maje&s;ty with that Rude|ne&s;s
and Barbarity, that He was much more odious to him than his Fa|ther;
<MILESTONE N="10">and in all the Letters which <HI>Lautherdale</HI> had found Opportunity to
write, whil&s;t He was a Pri&s;oner in <HI>England,</HI> to the King when He was be|yond
the Seas, He inveighed equally again&s;t the Son as the Father, and
never gave him any other Title than THAT TOAD'S BIRD: So that Nobody
could imagine from whence this Change could proceed, but from a De&s;ign
to pre&s;erve an Intere&s;t in the Pre&s;byterian Party again&s;t the Time He &s;hould
have Occa&s;ion to u&s;e them.</P>
<P>THEN there were Circum&s;tances in this Grace of the King to the Lord
<HI>Lorne,</HI> that exceeded all Mens Comprehen&s;ion: For his Maje&s;ty cau&s;ed all
the E&s;tate of the Marquis of <HI>Argyle,</HI> which did not appear in any Degree &s;o
<MILESTONE N="20">con&s;iderable as it was generally believed to have been, to be &s;eized upon as
forfeited to him; and then would grant it to the Son &s;o ab&s;olutely, that
neither the Owners &s;hould recover what had been injuriou&s;ly and violently
taken from them for their Loyalty to the King, nor the Creditors receive
Satisfaction for the ju&s;t Debts which were due to them, and which mu&s;t
have been &s;atisfied if the King had retained the Forfeiture. But upon the
Application of the Commi&s;&s;ioner and the other Lords, that the King would
hear all Per&s;ons concerned, there was &s;ome Mitigation in tho&s;e Particulars,
notwith&s;tanding all the Oppo&s;ition which <HI>Lautherdale</HI> did barefaced make
on the Behalf of the Lord <HI>Lorne,</HI> and which the other bore with great In|dignation:
<MILESTONE N="30">Which He knew very well, and did believe that the Oath and
Sub&s;cription, which He well knew They had contrived for the next Se&s;&s;ion
of Parliament, was levelled at him; that not taking it, as They did not be|lieve
He would do, the Secretary of <HI>Scotland's</HI> Place might become void,
which They had much rather &s;hould have been in any Man's Hand than
in his. And therefore He took all Occa&s;ions to profe&s;s and declare, be&s;ides
his con&s;tant Raillery again&s;t the Pre&s;bytery, &startq;that if They &s;hould require
him to &s;ub&s;cribe that He is a <HI>Turk,</HI> He would do it before He would lo&s;e
his Office.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Matter of the&s;e Offences being mo&s;t in private, and &s;o not pub|lickly
<MILESTONE N="40">taken Notice of, They made a fair Show and kept good Quarter to|wards
each other. And the King con&s;enting to all that the Commi&s;&s;ioner
propo&s;ed with Reference to the Publick, being indeed abundantly &s;atisfied
with his Comportment, and at parting promi&s;ing to give him the Office of
Trea&s;urer, when by <HI>Crawford's</HI> refu&s;ing to &s;ub&s;cribe it &s;hould become void;
They,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Commi&s;|&s;ioner and Bi&s;hops return to</HI> Scotland.</NOTE> with all their Bi&s;hops, returned again for <HI>Scotland</HI> with incurable
Jealou&s;y of <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> who remained waiting upon the King, and re|&s;olved
to cro&s;s all their De&s;igns He could, and quietly to expect a better
Opportunity to undo what He could not for the pre&s;ent prevent.</P>
<P>IT is Time now to return to the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Parliament meets.</HI></NOTE> which, ac|cording
<MILESTONE N="50">to the Time of the Prorogation, met again in <HI>March</HI> towards
the Entrance into the Year 1664: When at their fir&s;t Meeting the King
informed them at large of the In&s;urrection that had been endeavoured in
the Summer before in <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> which, how fooli&s;hly &s;oever contrived,
<PB N="218" REF="223">
was a very great In&s;tance of the Di&s;temper of the Nation; that three
Years after the di&s;banding of the Army, the Officers thereof &s;hould re|main
&s;till &s;o unquiet, as to hope to give any &s;ignal Di&s;turbance to the
Peace of the Kingdom, by &s;uch a Commotion as They could upon their
Credit rai&s;e.</P>
<P>THE continual Di&s;cour&s;e of Plots and In&s;urrections had &s;o wearied the
King,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An In&s;urrec|tion intended in</HI> York&s;hire.</NOTE> that He even re&s;olved to give no more Countenance to any &s;uch In|formations,
nor to trouble him&s;elf with Inquiry into them; but to leave
the Peace of the Kingdom again&s;t any &s;uch Attempts to the Vigilance of
the civil Magi&s;trates, and the Care of the Officers of the Militia, which He<MILESTONE N="10">
pre&s;umed would be &s;ufficient to quell and &s;uppre&s;s any ordinary fanatick
De&s;ign. And upon this Re&s;olution, and to avoid the Reproach of the late
Times, of contriving Plots only to commit Men to Pri&s;on again&s;t whom
there was any Prejudice, He totally neglected the fir&s;t Information He re|ceived
of this &s;editious Purpo&s;e. But when the Intelligence was continued
from &s;everal Parts, and &s;o particular for the Time and Place of the Ren|dezvous,
and for the &s;eizing upon the City of <HI>York;</HI> and there was Evi|dence
that &s;ome Men of E&s;tate and Fortune, and who were held wary and
di&s;creet Men, were engaged in it; his Maje&s;ty thought it Time to provide
again&s;t it, and not only commended the Care of it to the Lords Lieute|nants<MILESTONE N="20">
and Deputy Lieutenants of the Counties adjacent, but &s;ent likewi&s;e &s;e|veral
Troops of his own Hor&s;e to po&s;&s;e&s;s the City of <HI>York</HI> before the Day ap|pointed,
and to attend &s;ome of the Places of the Rendezvous.<NOTE PLACE="marg">But prevented.</NOTE> And They
came very &s;ea&s;onably, and &s;urpri&s;ed many upon the very Place, before their
Company was &s;trong enough to make Re&s;i&s;tance. Others did make &s;ome
Re&s;i&s;tance, but quickly fled and were di&s;per&s;ed. Many were taken, and
upon their Examination behaved them&s;elves as if They were &s;ure to be
quickly re&s;cued; for it appeared that They did believe that the In&s;urrection
would have been general throughout the Kingdom, and that all the di&s;|banded
Army would have been brought together at &s;everal Rendezvou&s;es.<MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>ALL the Pri&s;ons in the <HI>North</HI> were &s;o full, that the King thought it
nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end down four or five of the Judges of the &s;everal Benches
of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall</HI> to <HI>York,</HI> with a Commi&s;&s;ion of <HI>Oyer and Terminer,</HI>
to examine the whole Matter. There, though the Judges did not be|lieve
that They had di&s;covered the Bottom of the whole Con&s;piracy, They
found Cau&s;e to condemn very many; whereof &s;eventeen or eighteen were
executed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some of the Plutters exe|cuted.</NOTE> &s;ome reprieved, and very many left in Pri&s;on to be tried at the
next A&s;&s;izes. Among&s;t tho&s;e who were executed, the Man who was mo&s;t
looked upon was one <HI>Rymer,</HI> of the Quality of the better Sort of Grand|Jurymen,
and held a wi&s;e Man, and was known to be tru&s;ted by the<MILESTONE N="40">
greate&s;t Men who had been in Rebellion: And He was di&s;covered by a
Per&s;on of intimate Tru&s;t with him, who had heretofore the &s;ame Affections
with him, but would venture no more. He was a &s;ullen Man, and u&s;ed
few Words to excu&s;e him&s;elf, and none to hurt any Body el&s;e; though He
was thought to know much, and that having a good E&s;tate He would ne|ver
have embarked in a De&s;ign that had no Probability of Succe&s;s. Some
of the Pri&s;oners declared, &startq;that They were a&s;&s;ured by tho&s;e who engaged
them, that &s;uch and &s;uch great Men would appear at the Rendezvous or
&s;oon after.&endq; But that was not thought a &s;ufficient Ground to trouble
any Man, though &s;ome of them were very liable to Su&s;picion; &s;ince in<MILESTONE N="50">
all Combinations of that Kind, it is a mo&s;t u&s;ual Artifice to work upon
weak Men, by per&s;uading them that other Men, of whom They have great
E&s;teem, are engaged in it, who in Truth know Nothing of it.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="224">
THE Judges were returned from <HI>York</HI> little Time before the Parliament
met; and therefore the King thought it fit to awaken them to much Vigi|lance,
by informing them with what Secrecy that Con&s;piracy had been car|ried.
And his Maje&s;ty a&s;&s;ured them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Speech at the Meeting of the Parliament.</NOTE> &startq;that He was not yet at the Bottom
of that Bu&s;ine&s;s; and that it appeared manife&s;tly, that this Con&s;piracy
was but a Branch of that which He had di&s;covered as well as He could
to them about two Years &s;ince, and had been then executed nearer Hand,
if He had not by God's Goodne&s;s come to the Knowledge of &s;ome of the
principal Contrivers, and &s;o &s;ecured them from doing the Mi&s;chief They
<MILESTONE N="10">intended.&endq;</P>
<P>HIS Maje&s;ty told them, &startq;that They would wonder, (yet He &s;aid what
was true) that They were now even in tho&s;e Parts, when They &s;ee their
Friends under Trial and Execution, &s;till pur&s;uing the &s;ame Con&s;ultations:
And it was evident that They had Corre&s;pondence with de&s;perate Per&s;ons
in mo&s;t Counties, and a &s;tanding Council in <HI>London</HI> it&s;elf, from which
They receive their Directions, and by whom They were advi&s;ed to defer
their la&s;t intended In&s;urrection. But tho&s;e Orders &s;erved only to di&s;tract
them, and came too late to prevent their De&s;truction.&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;He
knew more of their Intrigues, than They thought He did; and hoped
<MILESTONE N="20">He &s;hould &s;hortly di&s;cover the Bottom: In the mean Time He de&s;ired
the Parliament, that They might all be as watchful to prevent, as They
were to contrive their Mi&s;chief.&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;He could not upon this
Occa&s;ion omit to tell them, that the&s;e de&s;perate Men in their Coun&s;els (as
appeared by &s;everal Examinations) had not been all of one Mind in the
Ways of carrying on their wicked Re&s;olutions. Some would &s;till in&s;i&s;t
upon the Authority of the Long Parliament, of which They &s;ay They
have Members enough willing to meet: Others have fancied to them|&s;elves,
by &s;ome Computation of their own, upon &s;ome Clau&s;e in the
<HI>Triennial Bill, that this pre&s;ent Parliament was at an End &s;ome Months
<MILESTONE N="30">&s;ince; and that for Want of new Writs They may a&s;&s;emble them&s;elves,
and chu&s;e Members for Parliament;</HI> and that this is the be&s;t Expedient
to bring them&s;elves together for their other Purpo&s;es. For the Long Parlia|ment,&endq;
his Maje&s;ty &s;aid, &startq;that He and They together could do no more
than He had done to inform and compo&s;e the Minds of Men; let them
proceed upon that at their Peril. But He thought there had been No|thing
done to di&s;abu&s;e Men in re&s;pect of the <HI>Triennial Bill.</HI> He confe&s;&s;ed
that He had often him&s;elf read over that Bill; and though there is no Co|lour
for the Fancy of the Determination of this Parliament; yet He would
not deny to them, that He had always expected that They would, and
<MILESTONE N="40">even wondered that They had not con&s;idered the wonderful Clau&s;es in
that Bill, which had pa&s;&s;ed in a Time very uncareful for the Dignity of
the Crown, or the Security of the People.&endq; His Maje&s;ty de&s;ired the
Speaker and the Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Commons, &startq;that They would
once give that <HI>Triennial Bill</HI> a Reading in their Hou&s;e; and then in God's
Name They might do what They thought fit for him, them&s;elves, and
the whole Kingdom.&endq; His Maje&s;ty &s;aid, &startq;that He needed not tell them
how much He loved Parliaments: Never King was &s;o much beholden to
Parliaments as He had been; nor did He think that the Crown could
ever be happy without frequent Parliaments. But He wi&s;hed them to
<MILESTONE N="50">a&s;&s;ure them&s;elves, that if He &s;hould think otherwi&s;e, He would never
&s;uffer a Parliament to come together, by the Means pre&s;cribed by that
Bill.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="225">
HE renewed his Thanks to them &startq;for the free Supply They gave him
the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of four Sub&s;idies; yet He could not but tell them, that
that Supply was fallen much &s;hort of what He expected and They in|tended.
That it would hardly be believed, yet They knew it to be true,
that very many Per&s;ons, who have E&s;tates of three or four thou&s;and Pounds
by the Year, do not pay for the&s;e four Sub&s;idies &s;ixteen Pounds: So that
whereas They intended and declared, <HI>that they &s;hould be collected ac|cording
to former Precedents,</HI> they do not now ari&s;e to Half the Propor|tion
they did in the Time of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> and yet &s;ure the Crown
wants more now than it did then, and the Subject is at lea&s;t as well able<MILESTONE N="10">
to give.&endq; His Maje&s;ty &s;aid, &startq;the Truth is, by the Licen&s;e of the late
ill Time, and ill Humour of this, too many of the People, and even of
tho&s;e who make fair Profe&s;&s;ions, believe it to be no Sin to defraud the
Crown of any Thing that is due to it. That They no &s;ooner gave him
<HI>Tonnage</HI> and <HI>Poundage,</HI> than Men were devi&s;ing all the Means They
could to &s;teal Cu&s;tom; nor could the Farmers be &s;o vigilant for the Col|lection,
as others were to &s;teal the Duties. They gave him the <HI>Exci&s;e,</HI>
which all People abroad believed to be the mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible Impo&s;ition that
can be laid upon a People: What Con&s;piracies and Combinations were
entered into again&s;t it by the Brewers, who He was &s;ure did not bear the<MILESTONE N="20">
Burden them&s;elves, even to bring that Revenue to Nothing, They would
hear in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall.</HI> They had given him the <HI>Chimney-Money,</HI>
which They had Rea&s;on to believe was a growing Revenue, for Men
build at lea&s;t fa&s;t enough; and They would therefore wonder, that it was
already declined, and that this Half Year brings in le&s;s than the former did.&endq;
He de&s;ired them therefore, &startq;that They would review that Bill; and &s;ince
He was &s;ure that They would have him receive what&s;oever They gave,
that He might have the collecting and hu&s;banding of it by his own Of|ficers,
and then He doubted not but to improve that Receipt, and He
would be cozened as little as He could.&endq;<MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>HIS Maje&s;ty concluded with &startq;de&s;iring and conjuring them to keep a
very good Corre&s;pondence together, that it might not be in the Power
of any &s;editious or factious Spirits to make them jealous of each other, or
either of them jealous of him, till They &s;ee him pretend one Thing and
do another, which He was &s;ure They had never yet done.&endq; He a&s;&s;ured
them, &startq;it &s;hould be in Nobody's Power to make him jealous of them.&endq; And
&s;o de&s;ired them, &startq;that They would di&s;patch what They found nece&s;&s;ary, that
They might be ready for a Se&s;&s;ion within two Months or thereabout,
becau&s;e the Sea&s;on of the Year would invite them all to take the Coun|try
Air.&endq;<MILESTONE N="40"></P>
<P>IT was very happy for his Maje&s;ty, that He did cut out their Work to
their Hand, and a&s;ked no Money of them, and limited them a &s;hort Time
to continue together. It made their Coun&s;els very unanimous: And though
They rai&s;ed no new Taxes and Impo&s;itions upon the People, They made
what They had before rai&s;ed much more valuable to the King than it was
before, by pa&s;&s;ing other Acts and Declarations for the explaining many
Things, and the better collecting the Money They had formerly given;
which much added to his Maje&s;ty's Profit without grieving the People, who
were rather gratified in the Remedies which were provided again&s;t Frauds
and Cozenage.<MILESTONE N="50"></P>
<P>THE Parliament had &s;ate but very little more than ten Days,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Triennial Bill <HI>repealed.</HI></NOTE> when They
pre&s;ented a Bill to his Maje&s;ty for the Repeal of the <HI>Triennial Bill,</HI> which
He had recommended to them; which was &s;o grateful to him, that He
<PB N="221" REF="226">
came in Per&s;on to the Hou&s;e to pa&s;s it and to thank them: And He told
them, &startq;that every good <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> would thank them for it; for it could
only have &s;erved to di&s;credit Parliaments, to make the Crown jealous of
Parliaments and Parliaments of the Crown, and per&s;uaded neighbour Princes
that <HI>England</HI> was not governed under a Monarch.&endq; The Truth is: It had
pa&s;&s;ed in a very jealous and &s;editious Time, when the Wickedne&s;s was fir&s;t in
hatching, that ripened afterwards to a di&s;mal Perfection; and when all, who
were &s;worn never to con&s;ent to the Di&s;heri&s;on of the Crown, thought only
of pre&s;erving their own Inheritance which They had gotten, or improving it
<MILESTONE N="10">at the Expen&s;e of the Crown; and made it manife&s;t enough, that it &s;hould wi|ther,
at lea&s;t while it &s;tood upon the Head of that King; for at that Time the
Con&s;piracy went no farther, that is among&s;t tho&s;e who had then Credit to pro|mote
its Pa&s;&s;age, though They were weak Men who thought it could re&s;t there.</P>
<P>AS They made this Entrance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some Acts pa&s;&s;ed:</NOTE> &s;o They were wholly intent upon Matters
of Moment, and di&s;patched all They intended to do within the two Months,
in which the King de&s;ired They would be ready for a Prorogation. And
as there was greater Order and Unanimity in their Debates, &s;o They di&s;|patched
more Bu&s;ine&s;s of publick Importance and Con&s;equence, than any
other Parliament hath done in twice the Time: For, be&s;ides the Repeal of the
<MILESTONE N="20">odious Bill before mentioned, They made a very good additional Bill for
the Chimney-Money, which made that Revenue much more con&s;iderable;
and They pa&s;&s;ed likewi&s;e another Bill again&s;t the frequenting of Conven|ticles,
which was looked upon as the greate&s;t Di&s;countenance the Parlia|ment
had yet given to all the Factions in Religion, and if it had been vi|gorou&s;ly
executed would no Doubt have produced a thorough Reforma|tion.
They made likewi&s;e a very good Act, and very nece&s;&s;ary for a Time
of &s;uch Corruption, that had contracted new Ways of Di&s;hone&s;ty and Villany
that former Times had not thought of, when many unworthy and cowardly
Ma&s;ters of Ships and Seamen had been contented to be robbed, and to &s;uffer
<MILESTONE N="30">all their Owners Goods to be taken, upon an Allowance made to them by the
Pirates; for the Di&s;covery and Puni&s;hment whereof the Law had not enough
provided. They therefore pre&s;ented a Bill to the King, &startq;for the Di&s;covery

<P>ALL this They pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty, and it was confirmed by his Royal
A&s;&s;ent on the 17th of <HI>May;</HI> when his Maje&s;ty, after giving &s;uch Thanks

Summer in the Tran&s;action of their own Affairs: Yet becau&s;e there might
&s;ome emergent Occa&s;ion fall out, that might make him wi&s;h to find them

<P>DURING this &s;hort Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, They, who were very &s;olicitous
to promote a War with <HI>Holland,</HI> forgat not what They had to do; but
<MILESTONE N="50">They quickly di&s;cerned that it was not a good Sea&s;on to mention the giving
of Money (which the King him&s;elf had forborne to mention, that the Peo|ple
might &s;ee one Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament pa&s;s without granting new Impo&s;i|tions,

<PB N="222" REF="227">
to &s;peak of a War. However They made &s;uch an Approach towards
it, as might make a farther Advance much more ea&s;y.</P>
<P>THE Merchants in the Committee of Trade much lamented the Ob&s;truc|tions
and Di&s;couragements,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Mer|chants remon|&s;trate again&s;t the</HI> Dutch.</NOTE> which They had long found in their Com|merce

<P>ALL which with &s;ome particular In&s;tances being reported from the Com|mittee
of Trade to the Hou&s;e, They had de&s;ired an Audience from his
Maje&s;ty, and then pre&s;ented this Grievance to him, and de&s;ired his Maje&s;ty,
that He would give &s;uch Order in it, as to his Wi&s;dom &s;hould &s;eem fit,
that might produce ju&s;t and honourable Satisfaction.&endq; The King, who
continued firm to his former Re&s;olution, an&s;wered them, &startq;that He would<MILESTONE N="20">

plea&s;ed them well, nor could They wi&s;h that the Pro&s;ecution &s;hould be
put into a better Hand than the Re&s;ident's, who was a Member of the
Hou&s;e, and a Man who had inflamed them more than the Merchants them|&s;elves

<P>THAT Re&s;ident was Sir <HI>George Downing,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Character of Sir</HI> George Downing <HI>the Re&s;ident in</HI> Holland.</NOTE> a Man of an ob&s;cure Birth, and

He had pa&s;&s;ed through many Offices in <HI>Cromwell's</HI> Army, of Chaplain,

beautiful Lady of a very noble Extraction, which was the Fate of many
bold Men in that pre&s;umptuous Time. And when <HI>Cromwell</HI> had &s;ubdued
the <HI>Dutch</HI> to that Temper He wi&s;hed, and had thereupon made a Peace
with them, He &s;ent this Man to re&s;ide as his Agent with them, being a
Man of a proud and in&s;olent Spirit, and who would add to any imperious
Command of his &s;omewhat of the Bitterne&s;s of his own Spirit.</P>
<P>AND He did &s;o fully execute his Charge in all Things, e&s;pecially when<MILESTONE N="40">
He might manife&s;t his Animo&s;ity again&s;t the Royal Party, that when the

made a Journey <HI>incognito,</HI> with not above four Per&s;ons, to &s;ee <HI>Am|&s;terdam</HI>
and from thence the Towns of <HI>North Holland; Downing</HI> coming
to have Notice of it delivered a Memorial to the <HI>States</HI> of <HI>Holland,</HI> wherein
He enclo&s;ed the third Article of their Treaty, by which They were obliged
not to &s;uffer any Traitor, Rebel or any other Per&s;on, who was declared
an Enemy to the <HI>Commonwealth</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> to re&s;ide or &s;tay in their
Dominions;&endq; and told them, &startq;that <HI>Charles Stuart</HI> and the Marquis of
<HI>Ormond</HI> had been lately in <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> and were &s;till in &s;ome Places ad|jacent;&endq;<MILESTONE N="50">
and required &startq;that They might not be permitted to remain in
any Part of their Dominions.&endq; Whereupon the <HI>States</HI> of <HI>Holland</HI> &s;ent
pre&s;ently to the Prince&s;s Royal, who was then at her Country Hou&s;e at <HI>Houn&s;|lerdike,</HI>
<PB N="223" REF="228">
&startq;that if her Brother were then with her or &s;hould come to her,
He &s;hould forthwith depart out of their Province:&endq; And not &s;atis|fied
herewith, They publi&s;hed an Order in the <HI>Hague</HI> to the &s;ame Pur|po&s;e,
which was &s;ent to <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> and other Towns according to their
Cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>WITH this rude Punctuality He behaved him&s;elf during the Life of <HI>Crom|well,</HI>
and whil&s;t his Son retained the U&s;urpation; but when He &s;aw him
thrown out with that Contempt, and that the Government was not like to
be &s;ettled again till there was a Re&s;ort to the old Foundation, He bethought
<MILESTONE N="10">him&s;elf how He might have a Re&s;erve of the King's Favour. And the
Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> making about that Time a Journey <HI>incognito</HI> to the
<HI>Hague,</HI> to treat of a Marriage for his elde&s;t Son with a noble Lady who&s;e
Friends lived there, <HI>Downing</HI> found Opportunity to have a private Con|ference
with him, and made Offer of his Service to the King, if his De|votion
might be concealed, without which it would be u&s;ele&s;s to his Ma|je&s;ty.
And for an Earne&s;t of his Fidelity, He informed him of &s;ome Parti|culars
which were of Moment for the King to know: Among&s;t which one
was, &startq;that a Per&s;on, who in Re&s;pect of his very honourable Extraction, and
the pre&s;ent Obligations him&s;elf had to the Royal Family, was not &s;u&s;|pected,
<MILESTONE N="20">gave him, as He had long done, con&s;tant Intelligence of what the
King did, and of many Particulars which in their Nature de&s;erved to be
more &s;ecret, which He had always &s;ent to <HI>Cromwell</HI> whil&s;t He was living;
but &s;ince his Death, having a Re&s;olution to &s;erve the King, He had never
di&s;&s;erved him, and would hereafter give him Notice of any Thing that
it would be nece&s;&s;ary for him to be informed of with Reference to <HI>Eng|land</HI>
or to <HI>Holland.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>THE Marquis thought it very fit to accept of &s;uch an In&s;trument, and
promi&s;ed him &startq;to acquaint his Maje&s;ty with his good Affection, who He
pre&s;umed would receive it graciou&s;ly, and give him as much Encouragement
<MILESTONE N="30">to continue it as his pre&s;ent Condition would permit.&endq; To which the other
replied, &startq;that He knew the King's pre&s;ent Condition too well to expect any
Reward from him: But if his Maje&s;ty would vouch&s;afe, when He &s;hould
be re&s;tored, to confirm to him the Office He then held of a Teller in
the Exchequer, and continue him in this Employment He then had in
<HI>Holland,</HI> where He pre&s;umed He &s;hould be able to do him more Service
than a Stranger could do, He would think him&s;elf abundantly rewarded.&endq;
Of all which when the Marquis adverti&s;ed the King at his Return to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI>
He had Authority to a&s;&s;ure him &startq;of the King's Acceptation, and that all
that He expected &s;hould be made good.&endq;</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40">THIS was the Ground and Rea&s;on, that when the King came to the
<HI>Hague</HI> the Year following to embark for <HI>England,</HI> He received <HI>Downing</HI>
&s;o graciou&s;ly, and knighted him, and left him there as his Re&s;ident;
which They who were near the King, and knew Nothing of what had
pa&s;&s;ed, wondered at as much as Strangers who had ob&s;erved his former Beha|viour.
And the <HI>States</HI> them&s;elves, who would not at &s;uch a Time of pub|lick
Joy do any Thing that might be ingrateful to his Maje&s;ty, could not
forbear to lament in private, &startq;that his Maje&s;ty would depute a Per&s;on to
have his Authority, who had never u&s;ed any other Dialect to per&s;uade
them to do any Thing He propo&s;ed, but Threats if They &s;hould not do
<MILESTONE N="50">it, and who at &s;everal Times had di&s;obliged mo&s;t of their Per&s;ons by his
In&s;olence.&endq; And from the Time of his Maje&s;ty's Departure from thence,
He never made tho&s;e Repre&s;entations which Men in tho&s;e Mini&s;teries u&s;e to
do, but put the wor&s;t Commentaries upon all their Actions. And when He
<PB N="224" REF="229">
&s;ate afterwards as a Member of the Hou&s;e, returning &s;till in the Interval
of Parliament to his Employment at the <HI>Hague,</HI> He took all Opportunities
to inveigh again&s;t their U&s;urpations in Trade; and either did or pretended
to know many of their My&s;teries of Iniquity, in opening of which He ren|dered
him&s;elf acceptable to the Hou&s;e, though He was a voluminous
Speaker, which naturally They do not like.</P>
<P>WHEN this Province was committed to him of Expo&s;tulation for the
Injuries &s;u&s;tained in &s;everal Places from the <HI>Dutch,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">He endeavours to bring on a War.</NOTE> He had his Wi&s;h, and
u&s;ed little Mode&s;ty in the urging of it. They an&s;wered, &startq;that mo&s;t of the
Particulars of which He complained were put under Oblivion by the late<MILESTONE N="10">
Treaty, and that in Con&s;ideration thereof They had yielded to many
Particulars for the Benefit of the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and that for the other Parti|culars,
they were likewi&s;e by the &s;ame Treaty referred to a Proce&s;s in
Ju&s;tice, of which They had yet no Cau&s;e to complain: Nor had there
been any Action pretended to be committed &s;ince the Treaty was con|cluded,&endq;
which was not many Months before, &startq;that might occa&s;ion a Mi&s;|under&s;tanding.&endq;
And &s;urely at this Time when the&s;e Things were urged
all this was true: But He, according to the Method He had been accu&s;|tomed
to, in&s;i&s;ted upon his own Demands; and frequently reproached them
with their former Submi&s;&s;ions to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and their pre&s;ent Pre&s;umptions<MILESTONE N="20">
upon the Goodne&s;s and Genero&s;ity of the King.</P>
<P>IT is without Que&s;tion, that the <HI>States General</HI> did, by the Standard of
their own Warine&s;s and Circum&s;pection, not &s;u&s;pect that the King did intend
to make a War upon them. They well knew the Streights and Nece&s;&s;ities
in which his Affairs &s;tood, with Reference to Money, and to the &s;everal
Di&s;tempers of the Nation in Matters of Religion, which might probably
grow more dangerous if there were a foreign War; and concluded, that
<HI>Downing's</HI> Importunities and Menaces were but the Re&s;ults of his own Im|petuo&s;ity,
and that the King would not be &s;olicitous to interrupt and part
with his own Peace. And therefore their own Ships They &s;ent out as They<MILESTONE N="30">
u&s;ed to do, and tho&s;e for the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea</HI> better prepared and &s;tronger
than of Cour&s;e. Nor was the Royal Company le&s;s vigilant to carry on that
Trade, but about the &s;ame Time &s;ent a &s;tronger Fleet of Merchants Ships
than They had ever before done; and for their better Encouragement the
King lent them two of his own Ships for a Convoy.</P>
<P>AND at this Time They gave the King an Advantage in Point of Ju&s;tice,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The in&s;olent Behaviour of the</HI> Dutch <HI>on the Coa&s;t of</HI> Guinea.</NOTE>
and which concerned all other Nations in Point of Traffick and Com|merce.
It had been begun by them in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies;</HI> where They had
planted them&s;elves in great and &s;trong Towns, and had many Harbours well
fortified, in which They con&s;tantly maintained a great Number of good and<MILESTONE N="40">
&s;trong Ships; by which They were ab&s;olute Ma&s;ters of tho&s;e Seas, and forced
the neighbour Kings and Princes to enter into &s;uch Terms of Amity with them
as They thought fit to require. And if They found that any advantageous
Trade was driven in any Port by any other Nation, They pre&s;ently &s;ent
their Ships to lie before that Port, and denounced War again&s;t the Prince
to whom that Port belonged; which being done, They publi&s;hed a Decla|ration,
&startq;that it &s;hould not be lawful for any Nation what&s;oever to trade in
the Territories of that Prince with whom They then were in War.&endq; And
upon this Pretence They would not &s;uffer an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship, belonging to the
<HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, to enter into a Port to lade and take in a <HI>Carga&s;on</HI><MILESTONE N="50">
of Goods, that had been provided by their Factors there before there was
any Mention or Imagination of &s;uch a War, and of which there was no other
In&s;tance of Ho&s;tility than the very Declaration. And at this Time They
<PB N="225" REF="230">
tran&s;planted this new Prerogative to <HI>Guinea:</HI> And having as They &s;aid, for
there was no other Evidence of it, a War with one of tho&s;e Princes,
They would not &s;uffer the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships to enter into tho&s;e Harbours
where they had always traded. The King received Animadver&s;ion of this
unheard of In&s;olence and U&s;urpation, and added this more ju&s;t Complaint to
the former, and required his Re&s;ident &startq;to demand a po&s;itive Renunciation of
all Pretence to &s;uch an odious U&s;urpation, and a Revocation of tho&s;e Or|ders
which their Officers had publi&s;hed.&endq; To this Complaint and De|mand
They deferred to make An&s;wer, till their Amba&s;&s;adour had pre&s;ented
<MILESTONE N="10">a Grievance to the King.</P>
<P>ONE of tho&s;e Ships of War,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Captain &s;eizes a</HI> Dutch <HI>Fort on the Coa&s;t of</HI> Africa.</NOTE> which the King had lent to the Royal Com|pany

a&s;&s;aulted and taken a Fort belonging to the <HI>Dutch</HI> near Cape <HI>Verde;</HI> which
was of more Incommodity to them than of Benefit to the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> Of this
Inva&s;ion their Amba&s;&s;adour made a loud Complaint, and demanded &startq;that
the Captain might be puni&s;hed &s;everely; and in the mean Time that the
King would give a pre&s;ent Order to him, the Amba&s;&s;adour, for the Re|delivery
of the Place and all that was in it, and He would &s;end it to his
Ma&s;ters, who would forthwith &s;end a Ship to demand it.&endq; The King
<MILESTONE N="20">had in Truth heard Nothing of it; and a&s;&s;ured the Amba&s;&s;adour, &startq;that
the Captain, if He had done any &s;uch Thing, had not the lea&s;t Commi&s;|&s;ion
or Authority for the doing it; and that He was &s;ure He was upon
his Way homeward, &s;o that He might be expected &s;peedily; and then
He &s;hould be &s;ure to undergo &s;uch Puni&s;hment as the Nature of his Of|fence
required, when the Matter &s;hould be examined, and They &s;hould
then receive full Reparation.&endq; This An&s;wer how rea&s;onable &s;oever &s;atis|fied
them not: Nothing would &s;erve their Turn but a pre&s;ent Re&s;titution,
before his Maje&s;ty could be informed of the Provocation or Ground that had
produced &s;o unwarrantable an Action. They gave pre&s;ent Orders for the
<MILESTONE N="30">equipping a very great Fleet, and the rai&s;ing many Land Soldiers, making
greater Preparations for War than They had made in many Years before.
They likewi&s;e prepared a &s;trong Fleet for <HI>Guinea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Dutch <HI>prepare a &s;trong Fleet for</HI> Guinea.</NOTE> and granted a Commi&s;|&s;ion
(which was publi&s;hed in Print) to the Commander in Chief, &startq;to make
War upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in tho&s;e Parts, and to do them all the Mi&s;chief
He could.&endq;</P>
<P>PRINCE <HI>Rupert,</HI> who had been heretofore with the Fleet then under
his Command, in the Beginning of the King's Reign, upon the Coa&s;t of
<HI>Guinea</HI> (and by the Report and Te&s;timony He gave of that Coa&s;t the
Royal Company had received greater Encouragement), now upon this in&s;olent
<MILESTONE N="40">Demeanour of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and publi&s;hing the Commi&s;&s;ion They had &s;ent
to their Commander in Chief, offered his Service to the King, &startq;to &s;ail
into tho&s;e Parts with &s;uch a Fleet as his Maje&s;ty thought fit to &s;end, with
which He made little Doubt to &s;ecure Trade,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>prepare one likewi&s;e.</HI></NOTE> and abate the Pre&s;umption
of the <HI>Dutch.</HI>&endq; And hereupon a Fleet was likewi&s;e preparing for that Pur|po&s;e,
to be commanded by Prince <HI>Rupert.</HI></P>
<P>THE Parliament had before declared, when They made their Addre&s;s to
the King again&s;t the <HI>Dutch</HI> for ob&s;tructing the Trade, &startq;that They would
with their Lives and Fortunes a&s;&s;i&s;t his Maje&s;ty again&s;t all Oppo&s;itions
what&s;oever, which He &s;hould meet with in the Removal of tho&s;e Ob&s;truc|tions;&endq;
<MILESTONE N="50">which They believed would terrify, but in Truth made the
<HI>Dutch</HI> merry: And in &s;ome of their Declarations or An&s;wers to <HI>Downing's</HI>
Memorials, They mentioned it with too much Pride and Contempt. And
in this Po&s;ture the Di&s;putes were when the Parliament met again in <HI>No|vember,</HI>
<PB N="226" REF="231">
which came together for the mo&s;t Part without a De&s;ire either to
give Money or make War.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment meets.</NOTE> And <HI>Downing,</HI> who laboured heartily to in|cen&s;e
us and to provoke them, in all his Di&s;patches declared, &startq;that all
tho&s;e In&s;olencies proceeded only from the Malignity of the <HI>States</HI> of <HI>Hol|land,</HI>
which could vent it&s;elf no farther than in Words; but that the
<HI>States General,</HI> without who&s;e Concurrence no War could be made, ab|horred
the Thought of it:&endq; And there is no Doubt that was true. And
the <HI>Dutch</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour, who remained at <HI>London,</HI> and was a very hone&s;t
weak Man, and did all the Offices He could to prevent it, did not think
it po&s;&s;ible it could come to pa&s;s; &startq;and that there might be &s;ome Scuffles<MILESTONE N="10">
upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI> by the Direction of the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Company,
of who&s;e Actions the <HI>States General</HI> took Notice, but would cau&s;e Ju&s;|tice
to be done upon Complaint, and not &s;uffer the publick Peace to be
di&s;turbed upon their Pretences.&endq; And &s;o the King forbore to demand
any Supply from the Parliament, becau&s;e an ordinary Supply would rather
di&s;credit his Demands than advance them, and He could not expect an ex|traordinary
Supply but when the War was unque&s;tionable. And the <HI>States
General</HI> at this Time were made a Property by the <HI>States</HI> of <HI>Holland</HI> (who
had given private Orders for their own Concernments), and pre&s;ented an hum|ble
De&s;ire to the King by their Amba&s;&s;adour, &startq;that Prince <HI>Rupert's</HI> Fleet might<MILESTONE N="20">
&s;tay in Harbour, as theirs likewi&s;e that was prepared for <HI>Guinea</HI> &s;hould do,
till &s;ome Means might be found for the Accommodation of all Differences.&endq;
Whereas before They pretended, that They would &s;end their <HI>Guinea</HI> Fleet
through the Channel, convoyed by their Admiral with a Fleet of fifty
Sail; which Report had before &s;topped Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> when He was under
Sail for <HI>Guinea,</HI> to wait and expect that Piece of Bravery. But this Ad|dre&s;s
from the <HI>States General</HI> made all Men believe there would be an Ac|commodation,
without &s;o much as any Ho&s;tility in <HI>Guinea.</HI></P>
<P>BUT it was quickly di&s;covered,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The treacher|ous Behaviour of the</HI> Dutch.</NOTE> that They were the hone&s;ter Men when
They gave the wor&s;t Words. For before the <HI>States General</HI> &s;ent to the<MILESTONE N="30">
King to &s;top Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> in Harbour, &startq;and that their Fleet &s;hould like|wi&s;e
remain in their Harbours,&endq; the <HI>States</HI> of <HI>Holland,</HI> or that Committee
that was qualified by them, had with great Privacy &s;ent Orders to <HI>De Ruyter,</HI>
who was in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> &startq;to make all po&s;&s;ible Ha&s;te with his
Fleet to go to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI> and not only to retake the Fort near
Cape <HI>Verde</HI> that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had taken from them, but likewi&s;e to take
what Places He could which were in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and to do
them what Damage He could in tho&s;e Parts:&endq; So that They might well
offer that their Fleet &s;hould now remain in their Harbours in <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN <HI>De Ruyter</HI> had been &s;ent into the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> the Pretence<MILESTONE N="40">
was, that it was again&s;t the Pirates of <HI>Algiers</HI> and <HI>Tunis,</HI> who had in Truth
preyed very much upon the <HI>Dutch,</HI> taken very many of their Ships, and had
Abundance of their Subjects in Chains. And when that Fleet was &s;ent into
the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> their Amba&s;&s;adour had de&s;ired the King, &startq;that his Ma|je&s;ty's
Fleet that was then in tho&s;e Parts might upon all Occa&s;ions join
with <HI>De Ruyter,</HI> when Opportunity &s;hould be offered thereby to infe&s;t the

the <HI>Dutch</HI> had no &s;uch Purpo&s;e: His Bu&s;ine&s;s was to ran&s;om their Captives
with Money, and not to exact the Delivery of them by Force; and to
make an Accommodation for the Time to come as well as He could. And<MILESTONE N="50">
when the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet was at any Time in Pur&s;uit of any of the <HI>Turks</HI> Ve&s;|&s;els,
and expected that the <HI>Dutch,</HI> by whom they mu&s;t pa&s;s, would have
given a little Stop to their Flight, which They might ea&s;ily have done;
<PB N="227" REF="232">

<P>AS &s;oon as the King knew of this impudent Affront,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Upon which their Ships are &s;eized.</NOTE> and that <HI>De Ruyter</HI>
was in Truth gone out of the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> He thought He might ju&s;tly
&s;eize upon any Ships of theirs, to &s;atisfy the Damage that He could not but
&s;u&s;tain by <HI>De Ruyter</HI> in <HI>Guinea:</HI> And &s;o, it being the Sea&s;on of the Year that
the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet returned with their Wines from <HI>Bordeaux, Rochelle,</HI> and
other Parts of <HI>France,</HI> &s;uch of them as were forced by the Weather to put
<MILESTONE N="10">into the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Harbours were &s;eized upon. And the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> having
put him&s;elf on Board with a Fleet of about fifty Sail, upon the Report of
the <HI>Dutch</HI> being come out to defend their Ships, took many others, even
upon their own Coa&s;ts; which They cho&s;e rather to &s;uffer, than to venture
out of their Ports to relieve them. However there was not any one of all tho&s;e
Ships &s;uffered to be unladen, or any Prejudice done to them; but they
were all pre&s;erved unhurt, till Notice might arrive from <HI>Guinea</HI> what <HI>De

<MILESTONE N="20">from them, and which his Maje&s;ty had offered to deliver, but by &s;eizing
upon &s;everal <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships in tho&s;e Parts, and by a&s;&s;aulting and taking other
his Maje&s;ty's Forts and Places, and exerci&s;ing all the Acts of Ho&s;tility which

<P>AND in a very &s;hort Time after,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They refu&s;e to deliver the I&s;land of</HI> Po|leroone.</NOTE> the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company complained

<P>WHEN there was now no Remedy, and the War was actually made upon
the King upon what Provocation &s;oever, there was Nothing to be done but to
re&s;ort to the Parliament, which had been &s;o earne&s;t to enter into it. A Fleet
mu&s;t be prepared equal to what the <HI>Dutch</HI> would infallibly make ready
<MILESTONE N="40">again&s;t the Spring, and worthy of the Pre&s;ence of the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> who
was impatient to engage his own Per&s;on in the Conduct of it; and the
King had given his Promi&s;e to him that He &s;hould, when He had, God
knows, no Purpo&s;e that there &s;hould be a War. It was quickly di&s;co|vered,
that there was not the &s;ame Alacrity towards a War now, after it
was begun, in the Parliament, as there had been when They made their
Vote: And They would have been glad that any Expedient might have been
found for a Reconciliation, and that the Captain might have been called
in Que&s;tion, who fir&s;t gave Offence by taking the Fort from the <HI>Dutch</HI> near
Cape <HI>Verde,</HI> which &s;ome had pre&s;&s;ed for when He came Home, before
<MILESTONE N="50">any more Mi&s;chief was done; and the not calling him in Que&s;tion made
many believe, that He had done Nothing without Warrant or Promi&s;e of
Protection.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="233">
THE <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;till di&s;claimed all Thought or Purpo&s;e of War, and &s;eemed
highly offended with their Governour of <HI>Poleroone,</HI> and prote&s;ted, &startq;that
the Not-delivery of the Place proceeded only from Want of an Order from
the Governour of <HI>Batavia,</HI> which Order came the next Day after the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship was departed: But that They had given Notice of it to the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factory at <HI>Bantam,</HI> that the &s;ame or another <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship might
return and receive it; and They were confident that it was then in the
Hand of the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI>&endq; But it was now too late to expect any honour|able
Peace, at lea&s;t without making very notable Preparations for a War,
which could not be done without ready Money. And whatever Orders<MILESTONE N="10">
had been given for the Pre&s;ervation of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships, it quickly appeared
that much of them had been embezzled or di&s;po&s;ed of, before they were
brought to any Judicatory, or adjudged to be Prize; and there was too
much Cau&s;e to fear, that the re&s;t would be di&s;po&s;ed of to other Purpo&s;es
than the Support of the War; though Nothing was more po&s;itively &s;poken,
than that the War would maintain it&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE Parliament &s;till promi&s;ed fairly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mea&s;ures taken to di&s;|po&s;e the Par|liament to grant Supplies for a War.</NOTE> and entered upon Con&s;ultation how
and what Money to rai&s;e. And now the King commanded the Chancellor
and the Trea&s;urer to meet with tho&s;e Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons,
with whom They had u&s;ed to con&s;ult, and to whom the King had joined<MILESTONE N="20">
others upon whom He was told He might more depend, and to adju&s;t to|gether
what Sum &s;hould be propo&s;ed, and how and in what Manner to
propo&s;e and conduct it. It was about the Month of <HI>January.</HI> And
though the Duke took indefatigable Pains, by going him&s;elf &s;ometimes to
<HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> and &s;ometimes to <HI>Chatham,</HI> to cau&s;e the Ships and all Provi&s;ions
to be ready, that He might be at Sea before the <HI>Dutch;</HI> yet let what Advance
could be made, as indeed there was great, Nothing could be &s;aid to be
done, till a great Stock of ready Money could be provided; and it would
be long after the Parliament had done their Part, before ready Money
would be got: And therefore no more Time mu&s;t be lo&s;t, without taking<MILESTONE N="30">
a particular Re&s;olution.</P>
<P>THE Meeting of tho&s;e Per&s;ons the King appointed was at <HI>Worce&s;ter-Hou&s;e,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Meeting of &s;ome Lords and principal Commoners for that Pur|po&s;e.</NOTE>
where the Chancellor and Trea&s;urer (who were known to be aver&s;e
from the War) told the re&s;t, &startq;that there was no more Debate now to be,
War or no War: It was come upon us, and We were now only to con|trive
the be&s;t Way of carrying it on with Succe&s;s; which could only be
done by rai&s;ing a great pre&s;ent Sum of Money, that the Enemy might &s;ee
that We were prepared to continue it as well as to begin.&endq; They who were
mo&s;t de&s;irous of the War, as Sir <HI>Harry Bennet</HI> and Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> (who were
in Truth the Men who brought it upon the Nation), with their Friends, were<MILESTONE N="40">
of the Opinion, &startq;that there &s;hould not be a great Sum demanded at pre&s;ent,
but only &s;o much as might carry out the Fleet in the Spring, and that &s;uffi|cient
Provi&s;ions might be made for the Summer Service: And then, when
the War was once thoroughly entered into, another and a better Supply
might be gotten about <HI>Michaelma&s;s,</HI> when there was Rea&s;on to hope, that
&s;ome good Succe&s;s would di&s;po&s;e all Men to a frank Pro&s;ecution of the
War.&endq; Whereas the&s;e Gentlemen had hitherto inflamed the King with
an A&s;&s;urance, &startq;that He could not a&s;k more Money of the Parliament than
They would readily give him, if He would be engaged in this War which
the whole Kingdom &s;o much de&s;ired.&endq;<MILESTONE N="50"></P>
<P>THE Chancellor and the Trea&s;urer were of Opinion, &startq;that the Hou&s;e of
Commons could never be in a better Di&s;po&s;ition to give, than They were
at pre&s;ent; that hereafter They might grow weary, and apt to find Fault
<PB N="229" REF="234">
with the Conduct, e&s;pecially when They found the Country not &s;o well
plea&s;ed with the War as They were now conceived to be: Whereas, now
the War was begun, and the King engaged in it as much as He could
be after ten Battles, and all upon their De&s;ire and their Promi&s;e; They
could not refu&s;e to give any Thing propo&s;ed within the Compa&s;s of that
Rea&s;on, which all under&s;tanding Men might examine and judge of. That
it was evident enough, that the true Ground of all the Confidence the
<HI>Dutch</HI> had was from their Opinion of the King's Nece&s;&s;ities and Want of
Money, and their Belief that the Parliament would &s;upply him very
<MILESTONE N="10">&s;paringly, and not long to continue &s;uch an Expen&s;e, as They very well
knew that a War at Sea would require: And They would be much con|firmed
in this their Imagination, if at the Beginning They &s;hould &s;ee
the Parliament give him &s;uch a Sum of Money, as &s;eemed to be implied
by what had been &s;aid. That They therefore thought it ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary,
that the King &s;hould propo&s;e as much, that is, that his Friends
&s;hould move for &s;uch a Sum, as might upon a rea&s;onable Computa|tion,
which every Man would be ready to make, and of which wi&s;e
Men upon Experience would ea&s;ily make an E&s;timate, carry on the War
for a full Year; that is, for the &s;etting out the pre&s;ent Fleet and paying
<MILESTONE N="20">it off upon its Return, and for the &s;etting out another Fleet the next
Spring. If this were now done, his Maje&s;ty would not be involved in
importunate Nece&s;&s;ities the next Winter; but He might calmly and deli|berately
con&s;ult upon &s;uch farther Supplies, as the Experience of what
would be then pa&s;t &s;hould &s;ugge&s;t to be nece&s;&s;ary: And that this would
give his Maje&s;ty &s;uch a Reputation with all his Neighbours, and &s;uch
Terrour to his Enemies, that it would probably di&s;po&s;e them to Peace.&endq;</P>
<P>THEY told them, &startq;the be&s;t Method to compute what the Expen&s;e
might amount to in a Year, would be by reflecting upon the va&s;t Di&s;pro|portion
of the Charge We were now already engaged in, and what had
<MILESTONE N="30">been e&s;timated four Months &s;ince, when the War was de&s;igned. That it
was well known to Mr. <HI>Coventry,</HI> who had been always pre&s;ent at tho&s;e
Conferences, that it had been &s;aid by the mo&s;t experienced Sea Officers,
and tho&s;e who had fought all the late Battles again&s;t the <HI>Dutch, that a Fleet
of forty or fifty &s;uch Ships, as the King's were, would be Strength &s;uffi|cient
to beat all the Ships the</HI> Dutch <HI>had out of the narrow Seas;</HI> and one
very eminent Man among&s;t them &s;aid, <HI>He would not de&s;ire above fifty Ships
to fight with all They had, and that He was confident that a greater Num|ber
than fifty could never be brought to fight orderly or u&s;efully:</HI> And yet that
there were at pre&s;ent no fewer than four&s;core good Ships preparing for the
<MILESTONE N="40">Duke. And the Charge in many other Particulars appeared already to
amount to double the Sum that was fir&s;t computed.&endq;</P>
<P>THEY concluded, &startq;that a le&s;s Sum than two Millions and a Half&endq; (which
is five and twenty hundred thou&s;and Pounds <HI>Sterling</HI>) &startq;ought not to be
propo&s;ed, and being once propo&s;ed ought to be in&s;i&s;ted on and pur&s;ued
without con&s;enting to any Diminution; for Nobody could conceive that
it would do more than maintain the War one Year, which the Parlia|ment
could not refu&s;e to provide for in the Beginning, as there was &s;o
much in Truth of it already expended in the Preparations and Expedition
the Duke had made in <HI>November,</HI> when He went to Sea upon the Fame
<MILESTONE N="50">of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet's Intention to convoy their <HI>Guinea</HI> Ships through the
Channel.&endq;</P>
<P>THERE was not a Man in the Company, who did not heartily wi&s;h that
that Sum or a greater might be propo&s;ed and granted: But They all,
<PB N="230" REF="235">
though They agreed in few other Things, prote&s;ted, &startq;that They could not
advi&s;e that &s;o prodigious a Sum &s;hould be as much as named; and that
They did not know any one Man, &s;ince it could not be thought fit that
any Man who had Relation to the King's Service &s;hould move it, who had
the Courage to attempt it or would be per&s;uaded to it.&endq;</P>
<P>THE two Lords continued very ob&s;tinate, &startq;that a le&s;s Sum &s;hould not
be named for the Rea&s;ons They had given,&endq; which the other confe&s;&s;ed to
be ju&s;t; and They acknowledged too, &startq;that the Propo&s;ition ought not to
be made by any Man who was related to the Court, or was thought to be
in any Grace there that might di&s;po&s;e him, nor yet by any Gentleman,<MILESTONE N="10">
how well &s;oever thought of, who was of a &s;mall E&s;tate, and &s;o to pay little
of &s;o great a Sum He was &s;o liberal to give.&endq; They therefore de&s;ired them
to name &s;ome of tho&s;e Members, who were hone&s;t worthy Men, and
looked upon as Lovers of their Country, and of great Fortunes, un&s;u&s;|pected
to have any De&s;igns at Court; and if They were not enough ac|quainted
with them, the Lords would find &s;ome Way by them&s;elves or
others to move them to it.&endq; Whereupon They named five or &s;ix Per|&s;ons
very well known, of whom the Hou&s;e had a very good E&s;teem, but
without any Hope that any of them would be prevailed with to under|take
it. The Lords &s;aid, &startq;They would try what might be done, and give<MILESTONE N="20">
them Notice the next Day, that if it were po&s;&s;ible it might be the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s
of the following Day.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Chancellor and the Trea&s;urer cho&s;e three <HI>Norfolk</HI> Gentlemen of tho&s;e
who had been named, becau&s;e They were good Friends and grateful to
each other, and de&s;ired them the next Day &startq;that They might confer toge|ther.&endq;
They told them, &startq;They knew well the State of Affairs; the
Parliament had engaged the King in a War, that could not be carried on
without a va&s;t Expen&s;e: And therefore if at the Entrance into it there
&s;hould be a &s;mall or an ordinary Supply given, it would bla&s;t all their
Hopes, and &s;tartle all other Princes from joining, with whom the <HI>Dutch</HI><MILESTONE N="30">
were not in Favour, and who would be inclined to the King, if They &s;aw
&s;uch a Provi&s;ion for the War as would be &s;ufficient to continue it for &s;ome
Time. And therefore They de&s;ired to confer with them, who upon all
Occa&s;ions manife&s;ted good Affections to the King, and who&s;e Advice had
a great Influence upon the Hou&s;e, upon the whole Matter how it might
be conducted.&endq; They all con&s;ented to what had been &s;aid, and pro|mi&s;ed
their own Concurrence and utmo&s;t Endeavours to compa&s;s what the
King &s;hould de&s;ire. The Lords &s;aid, &startq;They promi&s;ed them&s;elves more
from them, and that They would not only concur, but propo&s;e what
&s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary to be granted.&endq; And thereupon They enlarged upon<MILESTONE N="40">
the Charge which was already in View, and upon what was to be expected,
and concluded &startq;that two Millions and a Half were nece&s;&s;ary to be in&s;i&s;ted
on;&endq; and de&s;ired, &startq;that when the Debate &s;hould be entered upon, which
They hoped might be the next Day, one of them would propo&s;e this Sum
and the other would &s;econd it.&endq;</P>
<P>THEY looked long one upon another, as if They were &s;urpri&s;ed with the
Sum. At la&s;t one of them &s;aid, &startq;that the Rea&s;ons were unan&s;werable for
a liberal Supply; yet He did not expect that &s;o prodigious a Sum, which
He believed had never yet been mentioned in Parliament to be granted at
one Time, would be propo&s;ed: However He did not think it too much,<MILESTONE N="50">
and that He would do the be&s;t He could to an&s;wer any Objections which
&s;hould be made again&s;t it, as He doubted many would; but He confe&s;&s;ed
He dur&s;t not propo&s;e it.&endq; Another was of the &s;ame Mind, and with
<PB N="231" REF="236">
many good Profe&s;&s;ions de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed as to the fir&s;t propo&s;ing it.
The third, who was Sir <HI>Robert Pa&s;ton,</HI> a Per&s;on of a much greater E&s;tate
than Both the other who had yet very good Fortunes, and a Gentleman
of a very antient Extraction by his Father (and his Mother was Daughter to
the Earl of <HI>Lind&s;ey</HI>), declared very frankly, &startq;that He was &s;atisfied in his
Con&s;cience, that it would be very good for the Kingdom as well as for
the King that &s;uch a Sum &s;hould be granted: And therefore if They
thought him fit to do it, He would propo&s;e it the next Morning, let other
Men think what They would of him for it.&endq;</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10">THE Lords gave him the Thanks They ought to do, and &s;aid what was
nece&s;&s;ary to confirm him, and to thank the other Gentlemen for their Pro|mi&s;e
to &s;econd him, and gave Notice to the re&s;t of the Re&s;olution, that
They might call for the Debate the next Day; which was entered into with
a general Cheerfulne&s;s, every Man acknowledging the Nece&s;&s;ity and the
Engagement of the Hou&s;e, but no Man adventuring to name the Propor|tion
that &s;hould be given. When the Hou&s;e was in a deep Silence expect|ing
that Motion,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sir</HI> Robert Pa&s;ton <HI>moves for a Supply of 2,500,000 l.</HI></NOTE> Sir <HI>Robert Pa&s;ton,</HI> who was no frequent Speaker, but de|livered
what He had a Mind to &s;ay very clearly, &s;tood up, mentioned
&s;hortly the Obligation, the Charge of the War, and &startq;that the pre&s;ent Sup|ply
<MILESTONE N="20">ought to be &s;uch as might as well as terrify the Enemy as a&s;&s;i&s;t the
King; and therefore He propo&s;ed that They might give his Maje&s;ty two
Millions and a Half, which would amount to five and twenty hundred
thou&s;and Pounds.&endq; The Silence of the Hou&s;e was not broken; They
fate as in Amazement, until a Gentleman, who was believed to wi&s;h well
to the King, without taking Notice of what had been propo&s;ed, &s;tood up,
and moved that They might give the King a much le&s;s Proportion. But
then the two others, who had promi&s;ed to &s;econd, renewed the Motion
one after the other; which &s;eemed to be entertained with a Con&s;ent
of many, and was contradicted by none: So that, after a &s;hort Pau&s;e, no
<MILESTONE N="30">Man who had Relation to the Court &s;peaking a Word, the Speaker put it
to the Que&s;tion, &startq;whether They would give the King five and twenty
hundred thou&s;and Pounds for the carrying on the War again&s;t the <HI>Dutch;</HI>&endq;
and the Affirmative made a good Sound,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which is a|greed to by the Hou&s;e.</NOTE> and very few gave their Negative
aloud, and it was notorious very many fate &s;ilent. So the Vote was pre|&s;ently
drawn up into an Order; and the Hou&s;e re&s;olved the next Day to
be in a Committee, to agree upon the Way that &s;hould be taken for the
rai&s;ing this va&s;t Sum, the Proportion whereof could no more be brought
into Debate.</P>
<P>THIS brave Vote gave the King the fir&s;t Liking of the War: It was above
<MILESTONE N="40">what He had expected or indeed wi&s;hed to be propo&s;ed. And They, who had
been at the fir&s;t Conference, and delivered the Re&s;olution of the two Lords as
impo&s;&s;ible to be compa&s;&s;ed, not without In&s;inuation as if it were affected only
to indi&s;po&s;e the Hou&s;e to the War (yet They did not think fit to vary from the
Proportion, till They &s;aw the Succe&s;s of the Propo&s;ition, which the Lords were
engaged to procure a fit Per&s;on to make); when They found the Conclu|&s;ion
to be &s;uch as could be wi&s;hed, They commended the Coun&s;el, and
fell into another Extreme, that in the Thing it&s;elf and in the Con&s;equence
did very much Harm; which &s;hall be next mentioned, after I have &s;aid
that there appeared great Joy and Exaltation of Spirit upon this Vote, and
<MILESTONE N="50">not more in the Court than upon the Exchange, the Merchants generally
being un&s;kilfully inclined to that War, above what their true Intere&s;t could
invite them to, as in a &s;hort Time afterwards They had Cau&s;e to confe&s;s.</P>

THE King &s;ent to the Lord Mayor to call a Common Council, and
commanded the Chancellor, Trea&s;urer, and other Lords of his Council, to

for this noble Supply, prevailed with the City pre&s;ently to furni&s;h the King
with the Loan of two hundred thou&s;and Pounds; which being within few
Days paid into the Hands of the Trea&s;urer of the Navy, all Preparations for

all former Order, did the King no Good, and rendered tho&s;e unable to do
him Service who were inclined to it.<MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>THE new Secretary,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sir</HI> H. Ben|net <HI>and Sir</HI> C. Berkley <HI>care&s;s and amu&s;e Sir</HI> Rob. Pa&s;ton.</NOTE> and Sir <HI>Charles Berkley,</HI> who by this Time was en|tered
very far into the King's Favour and his Confidence, were the chief,
and by their Places had Acce&s;s to him in all Places and Hours: And They
much di&s;liked the Officiou&s;ne&s;s of the others, as if They pre&s;umed to invade
their Province. They thought it but their Due, that the King &s;hould take
his Mea&s;ures of the Hou&s;e of Commons by no other Report but theirs, nor
di&s;pen&s;e his Graces there through any other Conduit. They took this Oc|ca&s;ion
to care&s;s Sir <HI>Robert Pa&s;ton,</HI> who was a Stranger to them, and to
magnify the Service He had done the King, and the great Sen&s;e the King had
of it, and that He did long to give him his own Thanks: They invited him<MILESTONE N="40">
to come to the Court, and Sir <HI>Charles Berkley</HI> told him as from the King,
&startq;that his Maje&s;ty re&s;olved to make him a Baron.&endq; And by the&s;e daily
Court&s;hips and Importunities the Gentleman, who was well &s;atisfied with
what He had done, and never propo&s;ed any Advantage to him&s;elf from it,
was amu&s;ed, and thought He was not to refu&s;e any Honour the King thought
him worthy of, nor to neglect tho&s;e Graces which were offered to him by
Per&s;ons of their Intere&s;t. Yet He made not Ha&s;te to go to the Court, be|lieving
that it might make him le&s;s capable of &s;erving the King, and that
any Favour his Maje&s;ty &s;hould do him would be more &s;ea&s;onable here|after
than at pre&s;ent, left He might be thought to have made that Mo|tion<MILESTONE N="50">
in the Hou&s;e upon Promi&s;e of the other Reward. Yet after continued
Invitations He went thither, and tho&s;e Gentlemen pre&s;ented him to the
King, who &s;pake very graciou&s;ly to him, told him, &startq;He had done him
<PB N="233" REF="238">
great Service, which He would never forget,&endq; and many other princely
Expre&s;&s;ions, and &startq;that He &s;hould be glad to &s;ee him often,&endq; but no Par|ticular
to that Purpo&s;e which had been mentioned to him.</P>
<P>WHEN He went next, He found his Maje&s;ty's Countenance the &s;ame:
But They, who had courted and amu&s;ed him &s;o much, grew every Day more
dry and re&s;erved towards him; of which He complained to a Friend of his
who He knew had Intere&s;t in the Chancellor, and de&s;ired him to acquaint
him with all that had pa&s;&s;ed, who had not till then heard that He had been
at Court, and when He was informed of the whole Relation was very much
<MILESTONE N="10">troubled, well knowing, that how acceptable &s;oever tho&s;e Kinds of Court|&s;hips
were for few Days, they were attended with many Inconveniences
when the End was not corre&s;pondent with the Beginning. He knew well
the Re&s;olution the King had taken to create no more Noblemen, the Num|ber
whereof already too much exceeded: However He was very &s;orry, that
a Per&s;on of that Quality and Merit &s;hould be expo&s;ed to any Indignity,
for having endeavoured in &s;uch a Conjuncture to do his Maje&s;ty a &s;ignal
Service, and &s;ucceeded &s;o well; and &s;pake with the King at large of it, and
gave his Maje&s;ty a full Account of the Mode&s;ty and Temper of the Gentle|man,
of his Quality and Intere&s;t, and what had been &s;aid and promi&s;ed to
<MILESTONE N="20">him. The King was troubled, owned all that He had &s;aid him&s;elf to him,
as being very hearty, and &startq;that He would never forget the Service He
had done, but requite it upon any Opportunity;&endq; but prote&s;ted, &startq;that
He had never made any &s;uch Promi&s;e, nor given Sir <HI>Charles Berkley</HI>
any Authority to mention any &s;uch Thing to him, which would prove
very inconvenient;&endq; and therefore wi&s;hed, &startq;that his Friend would divert
him from pro&s;ecuting &s;uch a Pretence, which He knew to be contrary to
his Re&s;olution.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Chancellor knew not what to &s;ay, but truly adverti&s;ed his Friend
of all the King had &s;aid, who again informed Sir <HI>Robert Pa&s;ton,</HI> who
<MILESTONE N="30">thought him&s;elf very hardly treated, and went to Sir <HI>Charles Berkley,</HI> who
had not the &s;ame open Arms, yet a&s;&s;ured him &startq;that He had &s;aid Nothing
to him but by the King's Direction, which He mu&s;t aver. That He did
not u&s;e to interpo&s;e or move the King in any of his Affairs: But if He
would de&s;ire the Chancellor to take Notice of it, who He knew had a
great Affection for him, and upon who&s;e De&s;ire He had performed that
great Service, He was confident it would be attended with the Succe&s;s
He wi&s;hed, to which He would contribute all his Endeavours;&endq; intimating,
that if He had not what He de&s;ired, He might impute it to the Chancellor.&endq;
Upon which Sir <HI>Robert,</HI> who was well a&s;&s;ured of the Chancellor's Kindne&s;s,
<MILESTONE N="40">concluded that his Court-Friends had deluded him, or expected Money,
which He would not give: And &s;o the Matter ended with Prejudice to
the King.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the&s;e and the like very inconvenient Activities, which
lo&s;t more Friends than were gotten by them, the Noi&s;e of this &s;tupendous
Supply, given to the King at one Time, made good Impre&s;&s;ions upon all
who had any Affections for the King, and was wondered at in tho&s;e Places
where Money was mo&s;t Plenty. In <HI>Holland</HI> it wrought even to Con&s;ternation,
and the common People cried aloud for Peace, and the <HI>States</HI> pretended to
have great Hope as well as De&s;ire of it, and &s;ent their Amba&s;&s;adour, who
<MILESTONE N="50">remained &s;till in <HI>England,</HI> new Orders to &s;olicit it.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time the King neglected not to apply what Endeavours He
could u&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Condition of</HI> England <HI>in Re&s;pect to it$Neighbours.</HI></NOTE> to di&s;po&s;e his Allies to act &s;uch Parts as their own Intere&s;t might
rea&s;onably invite them to. From <HI>France</HI> He expected only Neutrality, by
<PB N="234" REF="239">
Rea&s;on He knew He had renewed the Alliance with the <HI>States;</HI> but never
&s;u&s;pected, that it was in &s;uch a Manner as would hinder the Neutrality.
<HI>Spain</HI> could do little Good or Harm, nor dur&s;t it to engage again&s;t <HI>Hol|land:</HI>
Yet all was done that was nece&s;&s;ary towards a good Corre&s;pondence
with it. The two Northern Kings would find them&s;elves concerned, at lea&s;t
to wi&s;h better to one Side than to the other; and had been Both &s;o di&s;|obliged
by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> that had it not been for the irreconcilable Jealou&s;y
They had of each other, They might have been united to the Intere&s;t of
<HI>England.</HI> But <HI>Denmark</HI> had in the late War given what They could not
keep nor recover, and yet could hardly be without; and <HI>Sweden</HI> looked with<MILESTONE N="10">
too much Contempt upon the Weakne&s;s and Unactivity of their Neighbour,
to give back any Thing They had got: And this re&s;trained them Both from
provoking an Enemy that might give Strength to the other.</P>
<P>YET <HI>Denmark</HI> had the Year before by <HI>Hannibal Ze&s;ted,</HI> who went Am|ba&s;&s;adour
into <HI>France</HI> and made <HI>England</HI> his Way, made many Com|plaints
to the King &startq;of the Oppre&s;&s;ion the Crown of <HI>Denmark</HI> underwent
by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and the Re&s;olution it had to &s;hake off that Yoke as &s;oon
as an Opportunity &s;hould be offered;&endq; and made a Reque&s;t to the King,
that He would endeavour to make the Alliance &s;o fa&s;t between <HI>Denmark</HI>
and <HI>Sweden,</HI> that the Jealou&s;y of each other might hinder neither of them<MILESTONE N="20">
from doing any Thing that was for their own Intere&s;t, without Prejudice
to the other.&endq; And when the Difficulty was alleged, in Regard that
<HI>Sweden</HI> would never be per&s;uaded to part with <HI>El&s;enore,</HI> and tho&s;e other
Places which had been given up in the late Treaty; <HI>Hannibal Ze&s;ted</HI> con|&s;ented
that what was done in that Treaty &s;hould be again confirmed, and
&s;aid &startq;his Ma&s;ter was willing and de&s;irous that the King of <HI>England</HI> &s;hould
undertake and be Caution for the Ob&s;ervation of this Treaty;&endq; implying,
that if this were done, and thereby the Fear of any further Attempt from
<HI>Sweden</HI> were extingui&s;hed, <HI>Denmark</HI> would not be long without redeem|ing
it&s;elf from the Vexation which it endured from <HI>Holland,</HI> which,<MILESTONE N="30">
upon former Nece&s;&s;ities and ill Bargains, upon the Matter had an Exemp|tion
from paying all Duties upon their own great Trade through the
<HI>Sound,</HI> as much to the Prejudice of all other Princes as of the poor Crown
of <HI>Denmark.</HI>&endq; This having &s;o lately pa&s;&s;ed from a Mini&s;ter of that Crown,
the King thought it a good Time to endeavour to do that Office between
the two Crowns, and thereby to unite them Both to the King in this Con|junction
again&s;t the <HI>Dutch;</HI> at lea&s;t that They might Both remain good
Friends to his Maje&s;ty, and &s;upply him with all tho&s;e Provi&s;ions without
which his Navy could not be &s;upported, and as far as was po&s;&s;ible re&s;train
the <HI>Dutch</HI> from tho&s;e Supplies, by making &s;uch large Contracts with the<MILESTONE N="40">
<HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that there would not be enough left for the other.</P>
<P>UPON this Ground He &s;ent Mr. <HI>Henry Coventry</HI> of his Bedchamber to the
<HI>Swede,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>$mba&s;&s;a$$urs $ut to</HI> Den|mark <HI>and</HI> $weden.</NOTE> who&s;e Friend&s;hip He much more valued as more able to a&s;&s;i&s;t him,
and upon who&s;e Word He could more firmly depend. And to <HI>Denmark</HI>
He &s;ent Sir <HI>Gilbert Talbot,</HI> who was acceptable to that Crown by his having
performed many Offices of Re&s;pect to the Prince of <HI>Denmark,</HI> when He had
been <HI>incognito</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and waited upon him to &s;everal Parts of the King|dom
which He had a Mind to &s;ee, and &s;o cau&s;ed him to be entertained in &s;e|veral
Gentlemens Hou&s;es in his Journey, of which the Prince &s;eemed very
&s;en&s;ible when He departed. That which was expected from that Negotia|tion,<MILESTONE N="50">
except the Confidence could be created between the two Crowns,
was only to pre&s;erve <HI>Denmark</HI> a Friend, that He might not favour the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> and might recall all his Subjects out of their Service; and that We
<PB N="235" REF="240">
might have the &s;ame Freedom of Trade, and the Security of his Ports for our
Men of War.</P>
<P>WHILST the King took this Care for the Advancement of his Affairs
abroad,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Propo&s;als made by the Bi&s;hop of</HI> Mun&s;ter <HI>for an Alliance again&s;t the</HI> Dutch.</NOTE> there was an Advantage offered him that looked as if it came from
Heaven. There came one Day a Gentleman, who looked rather like a
Carter, who &s;poke ill <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and de&s;ired that He might have a private
Audience with the Chancellor; who pre&s;ently &s;ent for him, and in a &s;hort
Time knew him to be a <HI>Benedictine</HI> Monk, who had been &s;ometimes with
him at <HI>Cologne,</HI> and belonged to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Abbey at <HI>Lam&s;pring</HI> in <HI>We&s;t|phalia,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="10">where a very reverend Per&s;on of the Family of <HI>Ga&s;coigne</HI> in <HI>York|&s;hire</HI>
was Abbot, with whom the Chancellor had much Acquaintance, and
e&s;teemed him very much; and He had, during the Time the King &s;tayed in
<HI>Cologne,</HI> &s;ent this Monk &s;everal Times thither, who was likewi&s;e a Gentleman,
but by living long in <HI>Germany</HI> had almo&s;t forgot the Language as well as the
Manners of his own Country. His Bu&s;ine&s;s now was to deliver him a Let|ter
(whereof He knew little of the Contents) from the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI>
upon the Edge of who&s;e Dominions that <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Abbey was &s;eated, which
had likewi&s;e a Territory that extended to the Principality of the other, and
received much Favour and Protection from the other; who de&s;ired the
<MILESTONE N="20">Abbot to give him an hone&s;t Man, that would carry a Letter from him to
the Court of <HI>England:</HI> Upon which this Monk was deputed, the rather be|cau&s;e
He was known to the Chancellor. The Matter of the Letter was no more,
than &startq;that if the War again&s;t <HI>Holland</HI> was to be re&s;olutely pro&s;ecuted by the
King of <HI>England,</HI> He (the Bi&s;hop) conceived that a Conjunction with
tho&s;e Allies, who could infe&s;t the <HI>Dutch</HI> by Land as his Maje&s;ty would
do by Sea, might not be unacceptable to his Maje&s;ty; and in that Cafe,
upon the An&s;wer to this Letter, He would &s;end a fit Per&s;on to make
&s;ome Propo&s;itions to the King and to treat with him.&endq; The In&s;tructions
the Monk had, were &startq;to make all po&s;&s;ible Ha&s;te back, and that as &s;oon as
<MILESTONE N="30">He returned on that Side the Sea, He &s;hould &s;end the An&s;wer He had
received, by the Po&s;t, &s;o directed as was appointed; and then that him&s;elf
&s;hould &s;tay at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> till He received farther Orders.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Chancellor quickly informed the King of this Di&s;patch, to whom
the Monk was likewi&s;e known; and his Maje&s;ty immediately a&s;&s;embled tho&s;e
Lords with whom He con&s;ulted in the mo&s;t &s;ecret Ca&s;es. Every Body knew
&s;o much of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> that He was a warlike Prince, having
had Command in Armies before He dedicated him&s;elf to the Church, and
that He had a great Animo&s;ity again&s;t <HI>Holland,</HI> which had di&s;obliged
him in the highe&s;t Point, by encouraging his Subjects to rebel again&s;t him,
<MILESTONE N="40">and tho&s;e of his City of <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> to &s;hut their Gates again&s;t him: And
when He endeavoured to reduce them by Force, and to that Purpo&s;e had
be&s;ieged them with his Army, the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;ent an Army to relieve it, and
declared that They would protect that City. And by this Means, and
by the Mediation of the neighbour Princes, who had no Mind that the
Peace of their Country &s;hould be di&s;turbed by &s;uch an Incur&s;ion, the
Bi&s;hop was hindered from taking that Vengeance upon his rebel Subjects
which He intended, and compelled to accept of &s;uch Conditions as did
not plea&s;e him. And all this was but two Years before, and boiled &s;till
in his Brea&s;t, that was naturally very hot. But He was a poor Prince, unable
<MILESTONE N="50">to give any Di&s;turbance to the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> who&s;e Dominions ex|tended
within a Day's March of his. However every Man was of Opi|nion,
that the Propo&s;ition ought to be very kindly received, and the Bi&s;hop
invited to &s;end his Agent. And to that Purpo&s;e the Chancellor wrote to
<PB N="236" REF="241">
him, and the Monk was di&s;patched the next Day. And having ob&s;erved
his Orders in &s;ending away the An&s;wer, He was very few Days at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI>
when a Servant of the Bi&s;hop arrived with Orders that the Monk &s;hould ac|company
him back into <HI>England:</HI> And &s;o They Both arrived in <HI>London</HI> in
le&s;s Time than could be expected.</P>
<P>THE Gentleman who came from the Bi&s;hop was a very proper Man,
well-bred, a Baron of that Country, but a Subject to the Bi&s;hop: He
brought with him a Letter of Credit from the Bi&s;hop to the King, and full
Authority to treat and conclude according to his In&s;tructions, which He
likewi&s;e pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty. He brought likewi&s;e a Letter to the<MILESTONE N="10">
Chancellor from the Elector of <HI>Mentz,</HI> in which He recommended to
him the Per&s;on whom the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> &s;hould &s;end, and declared
&startq;that He believed the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> would be able to perform what|&s;oever
He &s;hould undertake:&endq; Which Letter was a very great Encou|ragement
to the King; for his Maje&s;ty knew the Elector of <HI>Mentz</HI> very well
to be a very wi&s;e Prince and notoriou&s;ly his Friend, and that He would
not &s;ay &s;o much of the Ability of the Bi&s;hop to perform, except He knew
particularly his De&s;ign, and what He would undertake to do.</P>
<P>THE Baron's In&s;tructions were to propo&s;e, &startq;that his Maje&s;ty would
cau&s;e one hundred thou&s;and Pounds to be immediately paid, by Bills of<MILESTONE N="20">
Exchange at <HI>Hamburgh</HI> or <HI>Cologne</HI> or <HI>Francfort,</HI> to &s;uch Per&s;ons as the
Bi&s;hop &s;hould appoint to receive it; and &s;hould promi&s;e to pay fifty thou|&s;and
Pounds by the Month in the &s;ame Places for three Months to come:
Afterwards He hoped the Army would provide for its own Support. This
being undertaken on his Maje&s;ty's Part, the Bi&s;hop would be engaged,
within one Month after the fir&s;t Bills of Exchange for the one hundred
thou&s;and Pounds &s;hould be delivered into the Hands of his Agent the
Baron, that He would be in the Dominions of the <HI>States General</HI> with an
Army of &s;ixteen thou&s;and Foot and four thou&s;and Hor&s;e; with which
He was very confident He &s;hould within few Days be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of <HI>Arn|heim,</HI><MILESTONE N="30">
and &s;hortly after of <HI>Utrecht;</HI> And if the King's Fleet came before
<HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> that Army of the Bi&s;hop &s;hould march to what Place or
Quarter his Maje&s;ty &s;hould direct.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Baron was a&s;ked, &startq;how it could be po&s;&s;ible for the Bi&s;hop, though
a gallant Prince and very active, to draw together &s;uch an Army in &s;o
&s;hort a Time out of his &s;mall Province; and how He was &s;ure that his
Neighbours, who two Years before had compelled him to make &s;o di&s;ad|vantageous
a Peace with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> would not again u&s;e the &s;ame violent
Importunity to ob&s;truct his Proceedings.&endq; To which He an&s;wered, &startq;that
the Bi&s;hop would never undertake to bring &s;uch an Army together in &s;o<MILESTONE N="40">
&s;hort a Time, in which They could not be levied, but that He knows
They are already levied, and upon an A&s;&s;urance of Money can be brought
together in the &s;hort Time propo&s;ed: For the other, the Interpo&s;ition of his
Neighbours, He had not then, when They prevailed, Half that Army
which He was &s;ure He &s;hould now have; be&s;ides tho&s;e Neighbours were
now as much incen&s;ed again&s;t the <HI>Dutch</HI> as his Ma&s;ter was, and would
all engage with him again&s;t them; and that many of the Army that is de|&s;igned
were at pre&s;ent quartered in their Dominions; and that the Bi&s;hop
intended not to march in his own private Capacity, but as General of the
Empire, for which the Elector of <HI>Mentz</HI> had undertaken to procure him<MILESTONE N="50">
a Commi&s;&s;ion.&endq; He was demanded &startq;how his Ma&s;ter &s;tood with <HI>France,</HI>
and whether He did not fear that it would either prevent the Enterpri&s;e
by Mediation, or di&s;appoint it by &s;ending Aid to <HI>Holland.</HI>&endq; He an|&s;wered,
<PB N="237" REF="242">
&startq;his Ma&s;ter was confident <HI>France</HI> would not do him any Harm:
That He had &s;ent an Agent, from whom He &s;hould be &s;ure to receive
Letters by every Po&s;t.&endq; And within few Days after, He &s;hewed a Letter
that He had received from that Agent, in which He &s;aid, &startq;that <HI>Mon&s;ieur
de Lionne</HI> bade him a&s;&s;ure the Bi&s;hop, that his <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Maje&s;ty would
do Nothing to his Prejudice.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS being the State of that Affair, the King con&s;idered what He was
to do. The Propo&s;itions made by the Bi&s;hop were &s;uch, as it was not po&s;|&s;ible
for him to comply with. But then it was pre&s;umed by every Body,
<MILESTONE N="10">that very much would be abated of the Money that was demanded: For it
was not an auxiliary Army that was to be rai&s;ed for the King's Service,
who&s;e Conque&s;ts were to be applied to his Benefit, but an Army rai&s;ed to
revenge the Injuries which him&s;elf had received, and what He &s;hould get
mu&s;t be to his own Account; and his Maje&s;ty's Ho&s;tility at Sea would as
much facilitate his Enterpri&s;e at Land, as the marching of his Army might
probably di&s;turb and di&s;tract their Preparations for the Sea. Yet it could
not be expected, that the Bi&s;hop could draw this Army together (and the
Attempt was not to be made with le&s;s Force) without a good Supply of
Money, nor keep it together without Pay.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20">THE Advantage, that would with God's Ble&s;&s;ing attend this Conjunc|tion,
&s;pread it&s;elf to a very large Pro&s;pect. That the People generally in
the <HI>Provinces</HI> were very un&s;atisfied with this War, was a Thing notorious; and
that the Province of <HI>Holland</HI> which began it, and was entirely governed by
<HI>De Wit,</HI> did even compel the other Provinces to concur with them, partly
upon Hope that a farther Progre&s;s would be prevented by Treaty, or that a
Peace would follow upon the fir&s;t Engagement. But when They &s;hould
&s;ee an Army of twenty thou&s;and Men, which They &s;u&s;pected not, to in|vade
their Country at Land, and in that Part where They were mo&s;t &s;e|cure,
and from whence &s;o much of their nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ions were daily
<MILESTONE N="30">brought; They mu&s;t be in great Con&s;ternation, and draw all their Land
Army together, which They had not done in near twenty Years, and
could not be done to any Effect without va&s;t Charge, which would put
the People into a loud Di&s;traction. Finally, there was great Rea&s;on to cheri&s;h
the De&s;ign: And therefore the King re&s;olved by an unanimous Advice to
undertake any Thing towards it, that could be in his Power to perform.</P>
<P>THERE was one Difficulty occurred, that had not been thought of nor &s;o
much as apprehended by the Baron, which was the Return of the Money,
what&s;oever &s;hould be a&s;&s;igned to that Service; for of the three Places propo&s;ed
by him, be&s;ides the Secrecy that was requi&s;ite, all the Trade of <HI>London</HI>
<MILESTONE N="40">could not a&s;&s;ign one thou&s;and Pounds in the Month to be paid upon <HI>Cologne</HI>
and <HI>Francfort;</HI> nor could <HI>Hamburgh</HI> it&s;elf be charged with twenty thou|&s;and
Pounds in three Months Time: Which when the Agent knew, He
&s;eemed amazed, and &s;aid &startq;They had believed that it had been as ea&s;y to
have tran&s;mitted Money to tho&s;e three Towns, as it was for them to re|ceive
it from thence.&endq;</P>
<P>IN Conclu&s;ion, the King gave his An&s;wer in Writing, what Sum of
Money He would cau&s;e to be paid at once for the fir&s;t Advance, that the
Bi&s;hop might begin his March, and what He would afterwards cau&s;e to be

<MILESTONE N="50">admit him to accept, He &s;ent an Expre&s;s with it to the Bi&s;hop: And &startq;till
his Return,&endq; He de&s;ired, &startq;that the King would appoint &s;ome Per&s;on of
Experience to confer with him; and They might together inform them|&s;elves
of the be&s;t Expedients to return Money into <HI>Germany,</HI> &s;ince his Ma|je&s;ty
<PB N="238" REF="243">
had hitherto only undertaken to pay his A&s;&s;ignations in <HI>London.</HI>&endq;
What Succe&s;s this Treaty afterwards had will be related in its Place.</P>
<P>THESE Advantages from abroad being in this Manner deliberated and
de&s;igned, it may be very &s;ea&s;onable to look back, and con&s;ider what Pre|parations
were made at Home towards the carrying on this War, for which
the Parliament had provided &s;o bountifully: And if ordinary Prudence had
been applied to the Managery, if any Order and Method had been con|&s;ulted
and &s;teadily pur&s;ued for the conducting the Whole, the Succe&s;s would
have been an&s;werable, and at lea&s;t any Inconvenience from the &s;udden
Want of Money would have been prevented. But whoever was at any<MILESTONE N="10">
near Di&s;tance in that Time when tho&s;e Tran&s;actions were in Agitation, as
there are yet many worthy Men who were, or &s;hall be able to procure a
&s;incere Information of the Occurrences of that Time, will be obliged to
confe&s;s, that They who contrived the War had the entire conducting it,
and were the &s;ole Cau&s;es of all the ill Effects of it; which cannot be &s;et
down particularly without wounding tho&s;e, who were by their Confidence
in ill In&s;truments made acce&s;&s;ary to tho&s;e Mi&s;chiefs, in which them&s;elves
&s;uffered mo&s;t. Nor is it the End of this true Relation to fix a Brand
upon the Memory of tho&s;e, who de&s;erve it from the Publick and from very
many worthy Men, but is to &s;erve only for a Memorial to ca&s;t my own<MILESTONE N="20">
Eyes upon, when I cannot but reflect upon tho&s;e Proceedings; and by my
Con&s;ent &s;hall never come into any Hands but theirs, who for their own
Sakes will take Care to pre&s;erve it from any publick View or Peru&s;al.</P>
<P>IT cannot be denied and may very truly be averred,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The State of the Navy from the King's Re|&s;toration.</NOTE> that from the Hour
of the King's Return and being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the entire Government, the
Naval Affairs were never put into any Order. That Province, being com|mitted
to the Duke as Lord High Admiral of <HI>England,</HI> was entirely en|gro&s;&s;ed
by his Servants, in Truth by Mr. <HI>Coventry,</HI> who was newly made
his Secretary, and who made U&s;e of his other Servants, who were better
known to him, to infu&s;e into his Highne&s;s the Opinion, &startq;that whoever<MILESTONE N="30">
pre&s;umed to meddle in any Thing that related to the Navy or the Ad|miralty,
invaded his Juri&s;diction, and would le&s;&s;en him in the Eyes of the
People; and that He ought to be jealous of &s;uch Men, as of tho&s;e who
would undermine his Greatne&s;s; and that as He was &s;uperiour to all Men
by being the King's Brother, &s;o being High Admiral He was to render
Account to none but to the King, nor &s;uffer any Body el&s;e to interpo&s;e
in any Thing relating to it.&endq; Whereas in Truth there is no Officer of
the Crown more &s;ubject to the Council-Board than the Admiral of <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
who is to give an Account of all his Actions and of every Branch
of his Office con&s;tantly to the Board, and to receive their Orders: Nor<MILESTONE N="40">
hath He the Nomination of the Captains of the Ships, till upon the Pre|&s;entation
of their Names He receives their Approbation, which is never
denied. Nor was there any Coun&s;ellor who had ever fate at the Board in
the la&s;t King's Time, to whom this was not as much known as any Order
of the Table.</P>
<P>BUT there was no retrieving this Authority, not only from the Influence
Mr. <HI>Coventry,</HI> and They of the Family who adhered to him, had upon the
Duke, but from the King's own Inclination, who thought that tho&s;e Offi|cers,
who immediately depended upon him&s;elf and only upon him&s;elf, were
more at his Devotion than They who were obliged to give an Account to<MILESTONE N="50">
any other Superiour. And from the Time that He came fir&s;t into <HI>France,</HI>
He had not been accu&s;tomed to any Di&s;cour&s;e more than to the under|valuing
the Privy Council, as if it &s;hadowed the King too much, and
<PB N="239" REF="244">
u&s;urped too much of his Authority, and too often &s;uper&s;eded his own Com|mands.
And the Queen his Mother had, upon the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es, always
&s;ome In&s;tances of the Authority which in &s;uch a Ca&s;e the Council had a&s;|&s;umed
again&s;t the King's Judgment; the Exception to which, according to
the Relation which Nobody could que&s;tion, &s;eemed to be very rea&s;onable.
This Kind of Di&s;cour&s;e, being the Subject of every Day, made &s;o great
Impre&s;&s;ion that it could never be defaced, and made the Election and No|mination
of Coun&s;ellors le&s;s con&s;idered, &s;ince They were to be no more ad|vi&s;ed
with afterwards than before.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10">ANOTHER Argument, that u&s;ed to be as frequently infi&s;ted upon by the
Queen, and with more Pa&s;&s;ion and Indignation, was of the little Re&s;pect
and Reverence, that by the Law or Cu&s;tom of <HI>England</HI> was paid to the
younger Sons of the Crown; and though there was Nobody pre&s;ent in
tho&s;e Conver&s;ations who knew any Thing of the Law or Cu&s;tom in tho&s;e
Ca&s;es, yet all that was &s;aid was taken as granted. And not only the
Duke but the King him&s;elf had a marvellous Prejudice to the Nation in
that Part of good Manners: And it was ea&s;ily agreed, that the Model of
<HI>France</HI> was in tho&s;e and other Ca&s;es much more preferable, and which was
afterwards ob&s;erved in too many.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20">THIS being then the State and Temper of the Royal Family when the
King returned, which then con&s;i&s;ted of the Duke of <HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI> and two
Prince&s;&s;es more than it now hath; the very next Morning after the Fleet
came to <HI>Scheveling,</HI> the Duke went on Board and took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it as
Lord High Admiral: And &s;o his Secretary provided new Commi&s;&s;ions for
all the Officers who were in pre&s;ent Command, for which it is probable
They all paid very liberally; for with him the Cu&s;tom began to receive
five Pounds for every Warrant &s;igned by the Duke, and for which no Se|cretary
to any Lord Admiral formerly had ever received above twenty Shil|lings.
Mr. <HI>Coventry,</HI> who was utterly unacquainted with all the Rules and
<MILESTONE N="30">Cu&s;toms of the Sea, and knew none of the Officers, but was much courted
by all, as the Secretary to the Admiral always is, made Choice of Captain
<HI>Pen,</HI> whom the King knighted as &s;oon as He came on Board; who from
a common Man had grown up under <HI>Cromwell</HI> to the highe&s;t Command,
and was in great Favour with him till He failed in the Action of <HI>St. Do|mingo,</HI>
when He went Admiral at Sea, as <HI>Venables</HI> was General at Land,
for which They were Both impri&s;oned in the <HI>Tower</HI> by <HI>Cromwell,</HI> nor ever
employed by him afterwards: But upon his Death He had Command again
at Sea, as He had at this Time under <HI>Mountague</HI> when He came to attend
the King. With this Man Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> made a fa&s;t Friend&s;hip, and was
<MILESTONE N="40">guided by him in all Things.</P>
<P>ALL the Offices which belonged to the Ships, to the Navy, to the Yards,
to the whole Admiralty (except the three &s;uperiour Officers, which are not
in the Di&s;po&s;al of the Admiral), were now void, and to be &s;upplied by the
Duke, that is, by Mr. <HI>Coventry;</HI> who by the Advice of Sir <HI>William Pen,</HI>
who was &s;olely tru&s;ted by him in the Brocage, conferred them upon tho&s;e
(without ob&s;erving any other Rule) who would give mo&s;t Money, not con|&s;idering
any hone&s;t Seaman who had continued in the King's Service, or
&s;uffered long Impri&s;onment for him. And becau&s;e an incredible Sum of
Money did and would ri&s;e this Way, &s;ome principal Officers in the Yards,
<MILESTONE N="50">as the Ma&s;ter Smith and others, and the Keepers of the Stores, yielding &s;e|ven,
eight hundred or a thou&s;and Pounds; He had the Skill to move the
Duke to be&s;tow &s;uch Money as would ari&s;e upon &s;uch Place upon Sir
<HI>Charles Berkley,</HI> for another to another, and for &s;ome to be divided be|tween
<PB N="240" REF="245">
two or three: By which Means the whole Family was obliged, and
retained to ju&s;tify him; and the Duke him&s;elf looked upon it as a Gene|ro&s;ity
in Mr. <HI>Coventry,</HI> to accommodate his Fellow Servants with what He
might have a&s;ked or kept for him&s;elf. But it was the be&s;t Hu&s;bandry He
could have u&s;ed: For by this Means all Mens Mouths were &s;topped, and
all Clamour &s;ecured; whil&s;t the le&s;&s;er Sums for a Multitude of Offices of
all Kinds were re&s;erved to him&s;elf, and which, in the E&s;timation of tho&s;e
who were at no great Di&s;tance, amounted to a very great Sum, and more
than any Officer under the King could po&s;&s;ibly get by all the Perqui&s;ites
of his Place in many Years. By this Means, the whole Navy and Ships<MILESTONE N="10">
were filled with the &s;ame Men who had enjoyed the &s;ame Places and Offices
under <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and thereby were the better able to pay well for them;
whereof many of the mo&s;t infamous Per&s;ons which that Time took Notice
of were now become the King's Officers, to the great Scandal of their ho|ne&s;t
Neighbours, who ob&s;erved that They retained the &s;ame Manners and
Affections, and u&s;ed the &s;ame Di&s;cour&s;es They had formerly done.</P>
<P>BESIDES many other irreparable Inconveniences and Mi&s;chiefs which re|&s;ulted
from this Corruption and Choice, one grew quickly vi&s;ible and noto|rious,
in the &s;tealing and embezzling all Manner of Things out of the Ships,
even when they were in Service: But when they returned from any Voyages,<MILESTONE N="20">
incredible Proportions of Powder, Match, Cordage, Sails, Anchors, and all
other Things, in&s;tead of being re&s;tored to the &s;everal proper Offices which were
to receive them, were embezzled and &s;old, and very often &s;old to the King
him&s;elf for the &s;etting out other Ships and for repleni&s;hing his Stores. And
when this was di&s;covered (as many Times it was) and the criminal Per&s;on ap|prehended,
it was alleged by him as a Defence or Excu&s;e, &startq;that He had paid
&s;o dear for his Place, that He could not maintain him&s;elf and Family without
practi&s;ing &s;uch Shifts:&endq; And none of tho&s;e Fellows were ever brought to ex|emplary
Ju&s;tice, and mo&s;t of them were re&s;tored to their Employments.</P>
<P>THE three &s;uperiour Officers of the Navy were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their Of|fices<MILESTONE N="30">
by Patents under the Great Seal of <HI>England</HI> before the King's Re|turn;
and They are the natural e&s;tabli&s;hed Council of the Lord High Ad|miral,
and are to attend him when He requires it, and always u&s;ed of
Cour&s;e to be with him one certain Day in a Week, to render him an Ac|count
of all the State of the Office, and to receive his Orders and to give
their Advice. And now becau&s;e the&s;e three depended not enough upon him,
but e&s;pecially out of Animo&s;ity again&s;t Sir <HI>George Carteret,</HI> who be&s;ides
being Trea&s;urer of the Navy was Vice-Chamberlain of the King's Hou&s;|hold,
and &s;o a Privy Coun&s;ellor; Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> propo&s;ed to the Duke, &startq;that
in Regard of the Multiplicity of Bu&s;ine&s;s in the Navy, much more than in<MILESTONE N="40">
former Times, and the &s;etting out greater Fleets than had been accu&s;tomed
in that Age when tho&s;e Officers and that Model for the Government of the
Navy had been e&s;tabli&s;hed, his Royal Highne&s;s would propo&s;e to the King
to make an Addition, by Commi&s;&s;ioners, of &s;ome other Per&s;ons always
to &s;it with the other Officers with equal Authority, and to &s;ign all Bills
with them;&endq; which was a Thing never heard of before, and is in Truth
a le&s;&s;ening of the Power of the Admiral. It is very true, there have fre|quently
been Commi&s;&s;ioners for the Navy; but it hath been in the &s;ame
Place of the Admiral and to perform his Office: But in the Time of an
Admiral Commi&s;&s;ioners have not been heard of. One principal End in<MILESTONE N="50">
this was, to draw from the Trea&s;urer of the Navy (who&s;e Office Mr. <HI>Co|ventry</HI>
thought too great, and had implacable Animo&s;ity again&s;t him from
the fir&s;t Hour after He had made hit Friend&s;hip with <HI>Pen</HI>) out of his
<PB N="241" REF="246">
Fees (which, though no greater than were granted by his Patent and had
been always enjoyed by his Predece&s;&s;ors, were indeed greater than had u&s;ed
to be in Times of Peace, when much le&s;s Money pa&s;&s;ed through his Hands)
what &s;hould be enough to pay tho&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners; for it was not rea|&s;onable
They &s;hould &s;erve for Nothing, nor that They &s;hould be upon
the King's Charge, &s;ince the Trea&s;urer's Perqui&s;ites might be enough
for all.</P>
<P>THE Duke liked the Propo&s;ition well, and without conferring with any
Body el&s;e upon it propo&s;ed it to the King at the Council-Board, where
<MILESTONE N="10">Nobody thought fit to examine or debate what the Duke propo&s;ed; and the
King approved it, and ordered &startq;that the Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould receive each
five hundred Pounds by the Year:&endq; But finding afterwards that the Trea|&s;urer
of the Navy's Fees were granted to him under the Great Seal, his Ma|je&s;ty
did not think it ju&s;t to take it from him, but would bear it him&s;elf,
and appointed the Trea&s;urer to pay and pa&s;s tho&s;e Pen&s;ions in his Account.
The Commi&s;&s;ioners named and commended by the Duke to the King were
the Lord <HI>Berkley,</HI> Sir <HI>John Law&s;on,</HI> Sir <HI>William Pen,</HI> and Sir <HI>George Ay&s;cue,</HI>
the three la&s;t the mo&s;t eminent Sea-Officers under <HI>Cromwell,</HI> but it mu&s;t
not be denied but that They &s;erved the King afterwards very faithfully.
<MILESTONE N="20">The&s;e the King made his Commi&s;&s;ioners, with a Pen&s;ion to each of five
hundred Pounds the Year, and in &s;ome Time after added Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> to
the Number with the &s;ame Pen&s;ion: So that this fir&s;t Reformation in the
Time of Peace co&s;t the King one Way or other no le&s;s than three thou&s;and
Pounds yearly, without the lea&s;t vi&s;ible Benefit or Advantage. The Lord
<HI>Berkley</HI> under&s;tood Nothing that related either to the Office or Employ|ment,
and therefore very &s;eldom was pre&s;ent in the Execution. But after
He had enjoyed the Pen&s;ion a Year or thereabout, He procured Leave to
&s;ell his Place, and procured a Gentleman, Mr. <HI>Thomas Harvey,</HI> to give him
three thou&s;and Pounds for it: So &s;oon this temporary Commi&s;&s;ion, which
<MILESTONE N="30">might have expired within a Month, got the Reputation of an Office for
Life by the good Managery of an Officer.</P>
<P>THIS was the State of the Navy before the War with <HI>Holland</HI> was re|&s;olved
upon.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The State of the Navy at the Commence|ment of the War.</NOTE> Let us in the next Place &s;ee what Alterations were made in

of what would follow. There was no Di&s;cour&s;e now in the Court,
after this Royal Sub&s;idy of five and twenty hundred thou&s;and Pounds was
granted, but &startq;of giving the Law to the whole Trade of <HI>Chri&s;tendom;</HI> of
<MILESTONE N="40">making all Ships which pa&s;&s;ed by or through the narrow Seas to pay an
Impo&s;ition to the King, as all do to the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> who pa&s;s by
the <HI>Sound;</HI> and making all who pa&s;s near to pay Contribution to his
Maje&s;ty;&endq; which mu&s;t concern all the Princes of <HI>Chri&s;tendom:</HI> And
the King and Duke were often de&s;ired to di&s;countenance and &s;uppre&s;s
this impertinent Talk, which mu&s;t increa&s;e the Number of the Enemies.
Commi&s;&s;ioners were appointed to re&s;ide in all or the mo&s;t eminent Port-Towns,
for the Sale of all Prize-Goods; and the&s;e were cho&s;en for the mo&s;t
Part out of tho&s;e Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons, who were active to
advance the King's Service or who promi&s;ed to be &s;o, to whom liberal Sa|laries
<MILESTONE N="50">were a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P>THERE were then Commi&s;&s;ioners appointed to judge all Appeals,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Commi&s;&s;ioners of Appeals ap|pointed.</NOTE> which
&s;hould be made upon and again&s;t all Sentences given by the Judge of the

Earl of <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> the Lord <HI>A&s;hley,</HI> and the Secretaries of State, who were
like to be mo&s;t careful of the King's Profit. But then the Rules which were
pre&s;cribed to judge by were &s;uch as were warranted by no former Precedents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Inju&s;tice of their Sen|tences.</NOTE>
nor acknowledged to be ju&s;t by the Practice of any neighbour Nation, and
&s;uch as would make all Ships which traded for <HI>Holland,</HI> from what Kingdom
&s;oever, lawful Prize; which was fore&s;een would bring Complaints from all
Places, as it did as &s;oon as the War begun. <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniard</HI> and
<HI>Swede</HI> and <HI>Dane</HI> were alike treated; whil&s;t their Amba&s;&s;adours made loud
Complaints every Day to the King and the Council for the Inju&s;tice and the
Rapine, without Remedy, more than References to the Admiralty, and<MILESTONE N="10">
then to the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of Appeal, which increa&s;ed the Charge,
and rai&s;ed and improved the Indignity. Above all, the <HI>Han&s;e-Towns</HI> of
<HI>Hamburgh, Lubeck, Bremen,</HI> and the re&s;t (who had large Exemptions and
Privileges by Charter granted by former Kings and now renewed by this)
had the wor&s;t Luck; for none of them could ever be di&s;tingui&s;hed from
the <HI>Dutch.</HI> Their Ships were &s;o like, and their Language &s;o near, that not
one of their Ve&s;&s;els were met with, from what Part of the World &s;oever
they came, or whither&s;oever they were bound, but they were brought in; and
if the Evidence was &s;uch as there could be no Colour to retain them, but
that they mu&s;t be relea&s;ed, they always carried with them &s;ad Remem|brances<MILESTONE N="20">
of the Company they had been in.</P>
<P>THERE was one &s;ure Rule to make any Ship Prize, which was, <HI>if above
three</HI> Dutch <HI>Mariners were aboard it there need no further Proof for the For|feiture;</HI>
which being no where known could not be prevented, all Mer|chants
Ships, when they are ready for their Voyage, taking all Seamen on
Board of what Nation &s;oever who are nece&s;&s;ary for their Service: So that
tho&s;e <HI>Dutchmen</HI> who run from their own Country to avoid fighting (as very
many did, and very many more would have done), and put them&s;elves on
Board Merchants Ships of any other Country, where They were willingly en|tertained,
made tho&s;e Ships lawful Prize in which They &s;erved, by a Rule<MILESTONE N="30">
that Nobody knew nor would &s;ubmit to.</P>
<P>IT was re&s;olved that all po&s;&s;ible Encouragement &s;hould be given to Pri|vateers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Too much En|ceuragement given to Pri|vateers.</NOTE>
that is, to as many as would take Commi&s;&s;ions from the Admiral to
&s;et out Ve&s;&s;els of War, as They call them, to take Prizes from the Enemy;
which no Articles or Obligations can re&s;train from all the Villany They can
act, and are a People, how countenanced &s;oever or thought nece&s;&s;ary, that
do bring an unavoidable Scandal, and it is to be feared a Cur&s;e, upon the
ju&s;te&s;t War that was ever made at Sea. A Sail! A Sail! is the Word with
them; Friend or Foe is the &s;ame; They po&s;&s;e&s;s all They can ma&s;ter, and
run with it to any ob&s;cure Place where They can &s;ell it (which Retreats are<MILESTONE N="40">
never wanting), and never attend the Ceremony of an Adjudication. Be|&s;ides
the horrible Scandal and Clamour that this <HI>Cla&s;&s;is</HI> of Men brought
upon the King and the whole Government for Defect of Ju&s;tice, the Pre|judice
which re&s;ulted from thence to the Publick and to the carrying on
the Service is un&s;peakable: All Seamen run to them. And though the
King now a&s;&s;igned an ample Share of all Prizes taken by his own Ships to
the Seamen, over and above their Wages; yet there was great Difference
between the Condition of the one and the other: In the King's Fleet They
might gain well, but They were &s;ure of Blows, Nothing could be got there
without fighting; with the Privateers there was rarely fighting, They took<MILESTONE N="50">
all who could make little Re&s;i&s;tance, and fled from all who were too &s;trong
for them. And &s;o tho&s;e Fellows were always well manned, when the
King's Ships were compelled to &s;tay many Days for Want of Men, who were
<PB N="243" REF="248">
rai&s;ed by pre&s;&s;ing and with great Difficulty. And whoever &s;pake again&s;t
tho&s;e lewd People, upon any Ca&s;e what&s;oever, was thought to have no Re|gard
for the Duke's Profit, nor to de&s;ire to weaken the Enemy.</P>
<P>IN all former Wars at Sea, as there was great Care taken to appoint
Commi&s;&s;ioners for the Sale of all Prize-Goods, who under&s;tood the Value
of tho&s;e Commodities They had to &s;ell, yet were compelled to &s;ell better
Bargains than are u&s;ually got in publick Markets; &s;o there was all Strictne&s;s
u&s;ed in bringing all Receivers to as punctual an Account, as any other of
the King's Receivers are bound to make, and to compel them to pay in all
<MILESTONE N="10">the Money They receive into the Exchequer, that it might be i&s;&s;ued out to
the Trea&s;urer of the Navy or to other Officers for the Expen&s;e of the War.
And it had been a great Argument in the fir&s;t Con&s;ultations upon this War,
&startq;that it would &s;upport it&s;elf; and that after one good Fleet &s;hould be
&s;et out once to beat the <HI>Dutch</HI>&endq; (for that was never thought worthy of
a Doubt), &startq;the Prizes, which would every Day after be taken, would plen|tifully
do all the re&s;t: Be&s;ides the great Sum that the <HI>Dutch</HI> would give to
purcha&s;e their Peace, and the yearly Rent They would give for the Liberty
of fi&s;hing;&endq; with all which it was not thought fit to allow them &startq;to keep
above &s;uch a Number of Ships of War, limited to &s;o many Ton and to
<MILESTONE N="20">&s;o many Guns;&endq; with many Particulars of that Nature, which were care|fully
dige&s;ted by tho&s;e who promoted the War. But now, after this
Supply given by the Parliament, there was no more Danger of Want of
Money: And many Di&s;cour&s;es there were, &startq;that the Prize-Money might
be better di&s;po&s;ed in rebuilding the King's Hou&s;es, and many other good
U&s;es which would occur;&endq; and the King forbore to &s;peak any more of ap|pointing
Receivers and Trea&s;urers for that Purpo&s;e, when all or mo&s;t other
Officers, who were judged nece&s;&s;ary for the Service, were already named;
and the Lord Trea&s;urer, who by his Office &s;hould have the Recommenda|tion
of tho&s;e Officers to the King, had a Li&s;t of Men, who for the Repu|tation
<MILESTONE N="30">and Experience They had were in his Judgment worthy to be tru&s;ted,
to be pre&s;ented to the King when He &s;hould enter upon that Subject.</P>
<P>BUT one Evening a Servant of the Lord <HI>A&s;hley</HI> came to the Chancellor
with a Bill &s;igned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord A&s;hley obtains a $word$ appoint|ing
him Trea|&s;urer of Prize-Money.</NOTE> and de&s;ired in his Ma&s;ter's Name &startq;that it might be &s;ealed
that Night.&endq; The Bill was, &startq;to make and con&s;titute the Lord <HI>A&s;hley</HI> Trea|&s;urer
of all the Money that &s;hould be rai&s;ed upon the Sale of all Prizes, which
were or &s;hould be taken in this pre&s;ent War, with Power to make all
&s;uch Officers as &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary for the Service; and that He &s;hould
account for all Monies &s;o received to the King him&s;elf, and to no other
<MILESTONE N="40">Per&s;on what&s;oever, and pay and i&s;&s;ue out all tho&s;e Monies which He
&s;hould receive, in &s;uch Manner as his Maje&s;ty &s;hould appoint by Warrant
under his Sign Manual, and by no other Warrant; and that He &s;hould
be free and exempt from accounting into the Exchequer.&endq; When the
Chancellor had &s;een the Contents, He bade the Me&s;&s;enger tell his Lord,
&startq;that He would &s;peak with the King before He would &s;eal that Grant,
and that He de&s;ired much to &s;peak with him&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>THE next Morning He waited upon the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel|lor remon|&s;trates again&s;t &s;ealing this Grant.</NOTE> and informed him &startq;of
the Bill that was brought to him, and doubted that He had been &s;ur|pri&s;ed:
That it was not only &s;uch an Original as was without any Pre|cedent,
<MILESTONE N="50">but in it&s;elf in many Particulars de&s;tructive to his Service and to
the Right of other Men. That all Receivers of any Part of his Revenue
were accountable in the Exchequer, and could receive their Di&s;charge in
no other Place: And that if &s;o great a Receipt, as this was already&endq; (for
the Fleet of Wine and other Ships already &s;eized were by a general Compu|tation
<PB N="244" REF="249">
valued at one hundred thou&s;and Pounds), &startq;and as it evidently would
be, &s;hould pa&s;s without the mo&s;t formal Account; his Maje&s;ty might
be abominably cozened, nor could it any other Way be prevented. And in
the next Place, that this Grant was not only derogatory to the Lord Trea|&s;urer,
but did really degrade him, there being another Trea&s;urer made
more ab&s;olute than him&s;elf, and without Dependence upon him.&endq; And
therefore He be&s;ought his Maje&s;ty, &startq;that He would recon&s;ider the Thing
it&s;elf and hear it debated, at lea&s;t that the Trea&s;urer might be fir&s;t heard,
without which it could not be done in Ju&s;tice:&endq; To which He added,
that He would &s;peak with the Lord <HI>A&s;hley</HI> him&s;elf, and tell him how<MILESTONE N="10">
much He was to blame to affect &s;uch a Province, which might bring great
Inconveniences upon his Per&s;on and his E&s;tate.&endq;</P>
<P>HE quickly found that the King had not been &s;urpri&s;ed in what He had
done, &startq;which&endq; He &s;aid &startq;was ab&s;olutely in his own Power to do; and that
it would bring Prejudice only to him&s;elf, which He had &s;ufficiently pro|vided
again&s;t.&endq; However He &s;eemed willing to decline any Thing that
looked like an Affront to the Trea&s;urer, and therefore was content that the
&s;ealing it might be &s;u&s;pended till He had further con&s;idered.</P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>A&s;hley</HI> came &s;hortly to the Chancellor, and &s;eemed &startq;to take
it unkindly that his Patent was not &s;ealed:&endq; To which He an&s;wered, &startq;that<MILESTONE N="20">
He had &s;u&s;pended the immediate &s;ealing it for three Rea&s;ons; whereof
one was, that He might fir&s;t &s;peak with the King, who He believed
would receive much Prejudice by it; another, that it would not con&s;i&s;t
with the Re&s;pect He owed to the Lord Trea&s;urer, who was much af|fronted
in it, to &s;eal it before He was made acquainted with it. And in
the la&s;t Place, that He had &s;topped it for his, the Lord <HI>A&s;hley's,</HI> own Sake:
And that He believed He had neither enough con&s;idered the Indignity that
was offered to the Lord Trea&s;urer, to whom He profe&s;&s;ed &s;o much Re&s;|pect,
and by who&s;e Favour and powerful Interpo&s;ition He enjoyed the
Office He held, nor his own true Intere&s;t, in &s;ubmitting his E&s;tate to<MILESTONE N="30">
tho&s;e Incumbrances which &s;uch a Receipt would inevitably expo&s;e it to.
And that the Exemption from making any Account but to the King him|&s;elf
would deceive him: And as it was an unu&s;ual and unnatural Privi|lege,
&s;o it would never be allowed in any Court of Ju&s;tice, which would
exact both the Account and the Payment or lawful Di&s;charge of what Mo|ney
He &s;hould receive; and if He depended upon the Exemption He
would live to repent it.&endq;</P>
<P>HE an&s;wered little to the Particulars more than with &s;ome Sullenne&s;s,
that the King had given him the Office, and knew be&s;t what is good for his
own Service; and that except his Maje&s;ty retracted his Grant, He would<MILESTONE N="40">
look to enjoy the Benefit of it. That He did not de&s;ire to put an Af|front
upon the Lord Trea&s;urer; and if there were any Expre&s;&s;ions in his
Commi&s;&s;ion which reflected upon him, He was content they &s;hould be
mended or left out: In all other Re&s;pects He was re&s;olved to run the
Hazard.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Trea&s;urer him&s;elf, though He knew that He was not well u&s;ed,
and exceedingly di&s;dained the Behaviour of his Nephew (for the Lord
<HI>A&s;hley</HI> had married his Niece), who He well knew had by new Friend&s;hips
cancelled all the Obligations to him, would not appear to oppo&s;e what the
King re&s;olved, but &s;ate unconcerned and took no Notice of any Thing.<MILESTONE N="50">
And &s;o within a &s;hort Time the King &s;ent a po&s;itive Order to the Chan|cellor
to &s;eal the Commi&s;&s;ion;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King obliges him to &s;eal it.</NOTE> which He could no longer refu&s;e, and did
<PB N="245" REF="250">
it with the more Trouble, becau&s;e He very well knew, that few Men knew
the Lord <HI>A&s;hley</HI> better than the King him&s;elf did, or had a wor&s;e Opinion
of his Integrity. But He was now gotten into Friend&s;hips which were mo&s;t
behooveful to him, and which could remove or reconcile all Prejudices:
He was fa&s;t linked to Sir <HI>Harry Bennet</HI> and Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> in a League of|fen&s;ive
and defen&s;ive, the &s;ame Friends and the &s;ame Enemies, and had got
an entire Tru&s;t with the Lady, who very well under&s;tood the Benefit &s;uch
an Officer would be to her. Nor was it difficult to per&s;uade the King
(who thought him&s;elf more rich in having one thou&s;and Pounds in his Clo&s;et
<MILESTONE N="10">that Nobody knew of, than in fifty thou&s;and Pounds in his Exchequer) how
many Conveniences He would find in having &s;o much Money at his own
immediate Di&s;po&s;al, without the Formality of Privy Seals and other Mens
Warrants, and the Indecency and Mi&s;chief which would attend a formal
Account of all his generous Donatives and Expen&s;e, which &s;hould be known
only to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THOUGH the King &s;eemed to continue the &s;ame gracious Countenance
towards the Chancellor which He had u&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mea&s;ures taken to pre|judice the King again&s;t the Chancel|lor.</NOTE> and frequently came to his
Hou&s;e when He was indi&s;po&s;ed with the Gout, and con&s;ulted all his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
which He thought of publick Importance, with him with equal
<MILESTONE N="20">Freedom; yet He him&s;elf found, and many others ob&s;erved, that He had
not the &s;ame Credit and Power with him. The nightly Meetings had of
late made him more the Subject of the Di&s;cour&s;e; and &s;ince the Time of
the new Secretary They had taken more Liberty to talk of what was done
in Council, than They had done formerly: And the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI>
plea&s;ed him&s;elf and all the Company in acting all the Per&s;ons who &s;pake
there in their Looks and Motions, in which Piece of Mimickry He had an
e&s;pecial Faculty; and in this Exerci&s;e the Chancellor had a full Part. In
the Height of Mirth, if the King &s;aid &startq;He would go &s;uch a Journey or
do &s;uch a trivial Thing to-morrow,&endq; Somebody would lay a Wager that
<MILESTONE N="30">He would not do it; and when He a&s;ked Why, it was an&s;wered, &startq;that
the Chancellor would not let him:&endq; And then another would prote&s;t,
that He thought there was no Ground for that Imputation; however He
could not deny that it was generally believed abroad, that his Maje&s;ty was
entirely and implicitly governed by the Chancellor.&endq; Which often put
the King to declare in &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ion, &startq;that the Chancellor had &s;erved him
long, and under&s;tood his Bu&s;ine&s;s, in which He tru&s;ted him: But in
any other Matter than his Bu&s;ine&s;s, He had no other Credit with him
than any other Man;&endq; which They reported with great Joy in other
Companies.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40">IN the former Se&s;&s;ion of the Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Propo&s;al made to the King for Li|berty of Con|&s;cience.</NOTE> the Lord <HI>A&s;hley</HI> out of his In|differency
in Matters of Religion, and the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> out of his Good|Will
to the <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> had drawn in the Lord Privy Seal, who&s;e In|tere&s;t
was mo&s;t in the <HI>Pre&s;byterians,</HI> to propo&s;e to the King an Indulgence
for Liberty of Con&s;cience: For which They offered two Motives; the one,
&startq;the Probability of a War with the <HI>Dutch,</HI>&endq; though it was not then de|clared;
&startq;and in that Ca&s;e the Pro&s;ecution of People at Home for their &s;everal
Opinions in Religion would be very inconvenient, and might prove mi&s;|chievous.&endq;
The other was, &startq;that the Fright Men were in by Rea&s;on
of the late Bill again&s;t Conventicles, and the Warmth the Parliament ex|pre&s;&s;ed
<MILESTONE N="50">with Reference to the Church, had &s;o prepared all Sorts of Non-Conformi&s;ts,
that They would gladly compound for Liberty at any rea|&s;onable
Rates: And by this Means a good yearly Revenue might be rai&s;ed
to the King, and a firm Concord and Tranquillity be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the
<PB N="246" REF="251">
Kingdom, if Power were granted by the Parliament to the King to grant
Di&s;pen&s;ations to &s;uch whom He knew to be peaceably affected, for their Ex|erci&s;e
of that Religion which was agreeable to their Con&s;cience, without
undergoing the Penalty of the Laws.&endq; And They had prepared a Sche|dule,
in which They computed what every <HI>Roman Catholick</HI> would be wil|ling
to pay yearly for the Exerci&s;e of his Religion, and &s;o of every other
Sect; which, upon the E&s;timate They made, would indeed have amounted
to a very great Sum of Money yearly.</P>
<P>THE King liked the Arguments and the Project very well,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King op|proves it.</NOTE> and wi&s;hed
them to prepare &s;uch a Bill; which was done quickly, very &s;hort, and<MILESTONE N="10">
without any Mention of other Advantage to grow from it, than &startq;the Peace
and Quiet of the Kingdom, and an entire Reference to the King's own Judg|ment
and Di&s;cretion in di&s;pen&s;ing his Di&s;pen&s;ations.&endq; This was equally
approved: And though hitherto it had been managed with great Secrecy,
that it might not come to the Knowledge of the Chancellor and the Trea|&s;urer,
who They well knew would never con&s;ent to it; yet the King re|&s;olved
to impart it to them. And the Chancellor being then afflicted with the
Gout, the Committee that u&s;ed to be called was appointed to meet at
<HI>Worce&s;ter-Hou&s;e:</HI> And thither likewi&s;e came the Privy Seal and the Lord
<HI>A&s;hley,</HI> who had never before been pre&s;ent in tho&s;e Meetings.<MILESTONE N="20"></P>
<P>THE King informed them of the Occa&s;ion of their Conference,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel|lor and Trea|&s;urer oppo&s;e it at the private Committee.</NOTE> and
cau&s;ed the Draught for the Bill to be read to them; which was done, and
&s;uch Rea&s;ons given by tho&s;e who promoted it, as They thought fit; the
chief of which was, &startq;that there could be no Danger in tru&s;ting the King,
who&s;e Zeal to the Prote&s;tant Religion was &s;o well known, that Nobody
would doubt that He would u&s;e this Power, when granted to him, other|wi&s;e
than &s;hould be for the Good and Benefit of the Church and State.&endq;
The Chancellor and the Trea&s;urer, as had been pre&s;aged, were very warm
again&s;t it, and u&s;ed many Arguments to di&s;&s;uade the King from pro&s;e|cuting
it, &startq;as a Thing that could never find the Concurrence of either or<MILESTONE N="30">
Both Hou&s;es, and which would rai&s;e a Jealou&s;y in Both, and in the Peo|ple
generally, of his Affection to the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> which would not be good
for either, and every Body knew that He had no Favour for either of the
other Factions.&endq; But what the others &s;aid, who were of another Opinion,
prevailed more; and his Maje&s;ty declared, &startq;that the Bill &s;hould be pre&s;ented
to the Hou&s;e of Peers as from him, and in his Name; and that He hoped
none of his Servants, who knew his Mind as well as every Body there did,
would oppo&s;e it, but either be ab&s;ent or &s;ilent:&endq; To which Both the
Lords an&s;wered, &startq;that They &s;hould not be ab&s;ent purpo&s;ely, and if They
were pre&s;ent, They hoped his Maje&s;ty would excu&s;e them if They &s;pake<MILESTONE N="40">
according to their Con&s;cience and Judgment, which They could not for|bear
to do;&endq; with which his Maje&s;ty &s;eemed un&s;atisfied, though the Lords
of the Combination were better plea&s;ed than They would have been with
their Concurrence.</P>
<P>WITHIN few Days after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bill pre|&s;ented to the Hou&s;e of Lords.</NOTE> the Chancellor remaining &s;till in his Chamber
without being able to go, the Bill was pre&s;ented in the Hou&s;e of Peers by
the Lord Privy Seal, as by the King's Direction and Approbation, and
thereupon had the fir&s;t Reading: And as &s;oon as it was read, the Lord
Trea&s;urer &s;pake again&s;t it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Trea&s;urer and Bi&s;hops oppo&s; it at the fir&s;t Reading.</NOTE> &startq;as unfit to be received and to have the Counte|nance
of another Reading in the Hou&s;e, being a De&s;ign again&s;t the Pro|te&s;tant<MILESTONE N="50">
Religion and in Favour of the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI>&endq; with many &s;harp Reflec|tions
upon tho&s;e who had &s;poken for it; and many of the Bi&s;hops &s;pake
to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, and urged many weighty Arguments again&s;t it. However
<PB N="247" REF="252">
it was moved, &startq;that &s;ince it was averred <HI>that it was with the King's Pri|vity,</HI>
it would be a Thing unheard of to deny it a &s;econd Reading:&endq; And
that there might be no Danger of a Surpri&s;al by its being read in a thin
Hou&s;e, it was ordered &startq;that it &s;hould be read the &s;econd Time&endq; upon a
Day named &startq;at ten of the Clock in the Morning;&endq; with which all were
&s;atisfied.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time great Pains were taken to per&s;uade particular Men to
approve it: And &s;ome of the Bi&s;hops were &s;harply reprehended for oppo&s;ing
the King's Prerogative, with &s;ome Intimation &startq;that if They continued in that
<MILESTONE N="10">Ob&s;tinacy They would repent it;&endq; to which They made &s;uch An&s;wers
as in Hone&s;ty and Wi&s;dom They ought to do, without being &s;haken in
their Re&s;olution. It was rather in&s;inuated than declared, &startq;that the Bill
had been peru&s;ed,&endq; &s;ome &s;aid &startq;drawn, by the Chancellor,&endq; and averred
that He was not again&s;t it:&endq; Which being confidently reported, and be|lieved
or not believed as He was more or le&s;s known to the Per&s;ons pre&s;ent,
He thought him&s;elf obliged to make his own Sen&s;e known. And &s;o on the
Day appointed for the &s;econd Reading, with Pain and Difficulty He was
in his Place in the Hou&s;e: And &s;o after the &s;econd Reading of the Bill, He
was of Cour&s;e to propo&s;e the Commitment of it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Trea&s;urer and Bi&s;hops oppo&s;e it at the &s;econd Read|ing.</NOTE> Many of the Bi&s;hops and
<MILESTONE N="20">others &s;pake fiercely again&s;t it, as a Way to undermine Religion; and the
Lord Trea&s;urer with his u&s;ual Weight of Words &s;hewed the ill Con&s;equence
that mu&s;t attend it, and &startq;that in the Bottom it was a Project to get Money
at the Price of Religion; which He believed was not intended or known
to the King, but only to tho&s;e who had projected it, and it may be im|po&s;ed
upon others who meant well.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Lord Privy Seal, either upon the Ob&s;ervation of the Countenance
of the Hou&s;e or Adverti&s;ement of his Friends, or unwilling to venture his
Reputation in the Enterpri&s;e, had given over the Game the fir&s;t Day, and
now &s;pake not at all:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lord</HI> A&s;hley <HI>&s;peaks for it.</HI></NOTE> But the Lord <HI>A&s;hley</HI> adhered firmly to his Point, &s;pake
<MILESTONE N="30">often and with great Sharpne&s;s of Wit, and had a Cadence in his Words
and Pronunciation that drew Attention. He &s;aid, &startq;it was the King's
Misfortune that a Matter of &s;o great Concernment to him, and &s;uch a
Prerogative as it may be would be found to be inherent in him without
any Declaration of Parliament, &s;hould be &s;upported only by &s;uch weak
Men as him&s;elf, who &s;erved his Maje&s;ty at a Di&s;tance, whil&s;t the great
Officers of the Crown thought fit to oppo&s;e it; which He more wondered
at, becau&s;e Nobody knew more than They the King's un&s;hakeable Firm|ne&s;s
in his Religion, that had re&s;i&s;ted and vanqui&s;hed &s;o many great
Temptations; and therefore He could not be thought unworthy of a
<MILESTONE N="40">greater Tru&s;t with Reference to it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel|lor &s;peaks again&s;t it.</NOTE> than He would have by this Bill.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Chancellor, having not been pre&s;ent at the former Debate upon the
fir&s;t Day, thought it fit to &s;it &s;ilent in this, till He found the Hou&s;e in &s;ome
Expectation to hear his Opinion: And then He &s;tood up and &s;aid, &startq;that
no Man could &s;ay more, if it were nece&s;&s;ary or pertinent, of the King's
Con&s;tancy in his Religion, and of his under&s;tanding the Con&s;titution and
Foundation of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> than He; no Man had been Wit|ne&s;s
to more A&s;&s;aults which He had &s;u&s;tained than He had been, and
of many Victories; and therefore if the Que&s;tion were how far He might
be tru&s;ted in that Point, He &s;hould make no Scruple in declaring, that
<MILESTONE N="50">He thought him more worthy to be tru&s;ted than any Man alive. But
there was Nothing in that Bill that could make that the Que&s;tion, which
had confounded all Notions of Religion, and erected a Chaos of Policy
to overthrow all Religion and Government: So that the Que&s;tion was
<PB N="248" REF="253">
not, whether the King were worthy of that Tru&s;t, but whether that Tru&s;t
were worthy of the King. That it had been no new Thing for Kings to
dive&s;t them&s;elves of many particular Rights and Powers, becau&s;e They
were thereby expo&s;ed to more Trouble and Vexation, and &s;o deputed that
Authority to others qualified by them: And He thought it a very unrea|&s;onable
and unju&s;t Thing to commit &s;uch a Tru&s;t to the King, which
Nobody could &s;uppo&s;e He could execute him&s;elf, and yet mu&s;t &s;ubject
him to daily and hourly Importunities, which mu&s;t be &s;o much the more
unea&s;y to a Nature of &s;o great Bounty and Genero&s;ity, that Nothing is &s;o
ungrateful to him as to be obliged to deny.&endq;<MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>IN the Vehemence of this Debate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And drops &s;ome unguard|ed Expre&s;&s;ions.</NOTE> the Lord <HI>A&s;hley</HI> having u&s;ed &s;ome
Language that He knew reflected upon him, the Chancellor let fall &s;ome
unwary Expre&s;&s;ions, which were turned to his Reproach and remembered
long after. When He in&s;i&s;ted upon the Wildne&s;s and Illimitedne&s;s in the
Bill, He &s;aid, &startq;it was Ship-Money in Religion, that Nobody could know
the End of, or where it would re&s;t; that if it were pa&s;&s;ed, Dr. <HI>Goffe,</HI>
or any other Apo&s;tate from the Church of <HI>England</HI> might be made a Bi|&s;hop
or Archbi&s;hop here, all Oaths and Statutes and Sub&s;criptions being
di&s;pen&s;ed with:&endq; Which were thought two envious In&s;tances, and gave
his Enemies Opportunities to make Glo&s;&s;es and Reflections upon to his Di&s;|advantage.<MILESTONE N="20">
In this Debate it fell out that the Duke of <HI>York</HI> appeared very
much again&s;t the Bill; which was imputed to the Chancellor, and &s;erved
to <HI>heap Coals of Fire upon his Head.</HI> In the End, very few having &s;poken for
it, though there were many who would have con&s;ented to it, be&s;ides the
Catholick Lords, it was agreed that there &s;hould be no Que&s;tion put for the
Commitment; which was the mo&s;t civil Way of rejecting it, and left it to
be no more called for.</P>
<P>THE King was infinitely troubled at the ill Succe&s;s of this Bill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of|fended with the Chancellor and Trea&s;urer.</NOTE> which He
had been a&s;&s;ured would pa&s;s notwith&s;tanding the Oppo&s;ition that was ex|pected;
and it had produced one Effect that was fore&s;een though not be|lieved,<MILESTONE N="30">
in renewing the Bitterne&s;s again&s;t the <HI>Roman Catholicks.</HI> And
They, who watched all Occa&s;ions to perform tho&s;e Offices, had now a large
Field to expre&s;s their Malice again&s;t the Chancellor and the Trea&s;urer,
who&s;e Pride only had di&s;po&s;ed them to &s;hew their Power and Credit in
diverting the Hou&s;e from gratifying the King, to which They had been
inclined;&endq; and his Maje&s;ty heard all that could be &s;aid again&s;t them
without any Di&s;like. After two or three Days He &s;ent for them Both to|gether
into his Clo&s;et, which made it generally believed in the Court, that
He re&s;olved to take Both their Offices from them, and They did in Truth
believe and expect it: But there was never any Cau&s;e appeared after to think<MILESTONE N="40">
that it was in his Purpo&s;e. He &s;pake to them of other Bu&s;ine&s;s, without
taking the lea&s;t Notice of the other Matter, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with a Coun|tenance
le&s;s open than He u&s;ed to have towards them, and made it evident
that He had not the &s;ame Thoughts of them He had formerly.</P>
<P>AND when the next Day the Chancellor went to him alone, and was
admitted into his Cabinet, and began to take Notice &startq;that He &s;eemed to
have Di&s;&s;atisfaction in his Looks towards him;&endq; the King, in more Choler
than He had ever before &s;een him, told him, &startq;his Looks were &s;uch as
they ought to be; that He was very much un&s;atisfied with him, and

and did not expect that He would have carried him&s;elf in that Manner as
He had done in the Hou&s;e of Peers, having known his Maje&s;ty's own Opi|nion
<PB N="249" REF="254">
from him&s;elf, which it &s;eemed was of no Authority with him if it dif|fered
from his Judgment, to which He would not &s;ubmit again&s;t his Rea&s;on.&endq;</P>
<P>THE other, with the Confidence of an hone&s;t Man, entered upon the
Di&s;cour&s;e of the Matter, a&s;&s;ured him &startq;the very propo&s;ing it had done his
Maje&s;ty much Prejudice, and that They who were be&s;t affected to his
Service in Both Hou&s;es were much troubled and afflicted with it: And of
tho&s;e who advi&s;ed him to it, one knew Nothing of the Con&s;titution of
<HI>England,</HI> and was not thought to wi&s;h well to the Religion of it; and the
other was &s;o well known to him, that Nothing was more wonderful than
<MILESTONE N="10">that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould take him for a &s;afe Coun&s;ellor.&endq; He had Recour&s;e
then again to the Matter, and u&s;ed &s;ome Arguments again&s;t it which had not
been urged before, and which &s;eemed to make Impre&s;&s;ion. He heard all He
&s;aid with Patience, but &s;eemed not to change his Mind, and an&s;wered no
more than &startq;that it was no Time to &s;peak to the Matter, which was now
pa&s;&s;ed; and if it had been un&s;ea&s;onably urged, He might &s;till have
carried him&s;elf otherwi&s;e than He had done;&endq; and &s;o &s;pake of Some|what
el&s;e.</P>
<P>HIS Maje&s;ty did not withdraw any of his Tru&s;t or Confidence from him
in his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;eemed to have the &s;ame Kindne&s;s for him: But from
<MILESTONE N="20">that Time He never had the &s;ame Credit with him as He had before. The
Lord <HI>A&s;hley</HI> got no Ground, but Sir <HI>Harry Bennet</HI> very much, who,
though He &s;pake very little in Council, &s;hewed his Power out of it, by per
&s;uading his Maje&s;ty to recede from many Re&s;olutions He had taken there.
And afterwards in all the Debates in Council which were preparatory to the
War, and upon tho&s;e Particulars which have been mentioned before, which
concerned the Ju&s;tice and Policy that was to be ob&s;erved, what&s;oever was
offered by the Chancellor or Trea&s;urer was never con&s;idered. It was An|&s;wer
enough, &startq;that They were Enemies to the War;&endq; which was true, as
long as it was in Deliberation: But from the Time it was re&s;olved and re|medile&s;s,
<MILESTONE N="30">none of them who promoted it contributed any Thing to the car|rying
it on proportionably to what was done by the other two.</P>
<P>THERE was another and a greater Mi&s;chief than hath been mentioned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And with the Bi&s;hops.</NOTE>
that re&s;ulted from that unhappy Debate; which was the Prejudice and
Di&s;advantage that the Bi&s;hops underwent by their &s;o unanimous Di&s;like of
that Bill. For from that Time the King never treated any of them with
that Re&s;pect as He had done formerly, and often &s;pake of them too &s;lightly;
which ea&s;ily encouraged others not only to mention their Per&s;ons very neg|ligently,
but their Function and Religion it&s;elf, as an Invention to im|po&s;e
upon the free Judgments and Under&s;tandings of Men. What was
<MILESTONE N="40">preached in the Pulpit was commented upon and derided in the Chamber, and
Preachers acted, and Sermons vilified as laboured Di&s;cour&s;es, which the
Preachers made only to &s;hew their own Parts and Wit, without any other
De&s;ign than to be commended and preferred. The&s;e grew to be the Subjects
of the Mirth and Wit of the Court; and &s;o much Licen&s;e was manife&s;ted in
it, that gave infinite Scandal to tho&s;e who ob&s;erved it, and to tho&s;e who
received the Reports of it: And all &s;erious and prudent Men took it as an
ill Pre&s;age, that whil&s;t all warlike Preparations were made in Abundance
&s;uitable to the Occa&s;ion, there &s;hould &s;o little Preparation of Spirit be for a
War again&s;t an Enemy, who might po&s;&s;ibly be without &s;ome of our Virtues,
<MILESTONE N="50">but a&s;&s;uredly was without any of our Vices.</P>
<P>THERE begun now to appear another Enemy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Plague breaks out.</NOTE> much more formidable
than the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and more difficult to be &s;truggled with; which was the
Plague, that brake out in the Winter, and made &s;uch an early Progre&s;s in
<PB N="250" REF="255">
the Spring, that though the weekly Numbers did not ri&s;e high, and it ap|peared
to be only in the Out&s;kirts of the Town, and in the mo&s;t ob&s;cure
Alleys, among&s;t the poore&s;t People; yet the ancient Men, who well re|membered
in what Manner the la&s;t great Plague (which had been near forty
Years before) fir&s;t brake out, and the Progre&s;s it afterwards made, fore|told
a terrible Summer. And many of them removed their Families out
of the City to Country-Habitations; when their Neighbours laughed at their
Providence, and thought They might have &s;tayed without Danger: But
They found &s;hortly that They had done wi&s;ely. In <HI>March</HI> it &s;pread &s;o
much, that the Parliament was very willing to part: Which was likewi&s;e<MILESTONE N="10">
the more nece&s;&s;ary, in Regard that &s;o many of the Members of the Hou&s;e of
Commons were a&s;&s;igned to &s;o many Offices and Employments which related
to the War, and which required their immediate Attendance. For though
the Fleet was not yet gone out, yet there were many Prizes daily brought
in, be&s;ides the fir&s;t Seizure, which by this Time was adjudged lawful Prize;
in all which great Lo&s;s was &s;u&s;tained by the Licen&s;e of Officers as well
as common Men, and the Ab&s;ence of &s;uch as &s;hould re&s;train and puni&s;h it:
So that, as &s;oon as the Bill was pa&s;&s;ed the Hou&s;es for the good Aid They
had given the King, and was ready for the Royal A&s;&s;ent, his Maje&s;ty pa&s;&s;ed
it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment pro|rogued.</NOTE> and prorogued the Parliament in <HI>April</HI> (which was in 1665) till <HI>Sep|tember</HI><MILESTONE N="20">

or allay the Fiercene&s;s of the Plague,&endq; which at that Time raged
more, &startq;He &s;hould be glad to meet them then; by which Time They
would judge by &s;ome Succe&s;s of the War, what was more to be done.
But if that Vi&s;itation increa&s;ed, They &s;hould have Notice by Proclama|tion
that They might not hazard them&s;elves.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Parliament being thus prorogued,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fleet pre|pared.</NOTE> there was the &s;ame Rea&s;on to
ha&s;ten out the Fleet; towards which the Duke left Nothing undone, which
his unwearied Indu&s;try and Example could contribute towards it, being him|&s;elf
on Board, and having got all Things nece&s;&s;ary into his own Ship that<MILESTONE N="30">
He cared for. But He found that it was ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite to put out
to Sea, though many Things were wanting in other Ships, even of Beer
and other Provi&s;ion of Victual; not only to be before the Enemy, but be|cau&s;e
He &s;aw it would be impo&s;&s;ible, whil&s;t the Ships were in Port, to keep
the Seamen from going on Shore, by which They might bring the Plague
on Board with them; and there was already a Su&s;picion that the Infection
was got into one of the &s;maller Ships.</P>
<P>IT hath been &s;aid before, that all Things relating to the Fleet were upon
the Matter wholly governed by Mr. <HI>Coventry.</HI> It is very true, that the
Officers of the Navy con&s;tantly attended the Duke together with tho&s;e<MILESTONE N="40">
three Sea-Captains who have been named before:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of <HI>York</HI> consults much with three eminent Sea Officers.</NOTE> But from the Time that the
War was declared, his Highne&s;s con&s;ulted daily, for his own Information
and In&s;truction, with Sir <HI>John Law&s;on</HI> and Sir <HI>George Ay&s;cue</HI> and Sir
<HI>William Pen,</HI> all Men of great Experience, and who had commanded in
&s;everal Battles. Upon the Advice of the&s;e Men the Duke always made his
E&s;timates and all Propo&s;itions to the King. There was &s;omewhat of Ri|val&s;hip
between the two la&s;t, becau&s;e They had been in equal Command:
Therefore the Duke took Sir <HI>William Pen</HI> into his own Ship, and made
him Captain of it; which was a great Tru&s;t, and a very honourable Com|mand,
that exempted him from receiving any Orders but from the Duke,<MILESTONE N="50">
and &s;o extingui&s;hed the other Emulation, the other two being Flag-Of|ficers
and to command &s;everal Squadrons.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="256">
IN all Conferences with the&s;e Men Mr. <HI>Coventry's</HI> Pre&s;ence and Attend|ance
was nece&s;&s;ary, both to reduce all Things into Writing which were
agreed upon, and to be able to put the Duke in Mind of what He was to
do. <HI>Law&s;on</HI> was the Man of who&s;e Judgment the Duke had the be&s;t
E&s;teem: And He was in Truth, of a Man of that Breeding (for He was a
perfect Tarpawlin), a very extraordinary Per&s;on; He under&s;tood his Pro|fe&s;&s;ion
incomparably well, &s;pake clearly and pertinently, but not pertina|ciou&s;ly
enough when He was contradicted. <HI>Ay&s;cue</HI> was a Gentleman, but
had kept ill Company too long, which had blunted his Under&s;tanding, if
<MILESTONE N="10">it had been ever &s;harp: He was of few Words, yet &s;pake to the Purpo&s;e
and to be ea&s;ily under&s;tood. <HI>Pen,</HI> who had much the wor&s;t Under&s;tand|ing,
had a great Mind to appear better bred, and to &s;peak like a Gentle|man;
He had got many good Words which He u&s;ed at Adventure; He
was a formal Man, and &s;pake very lei&s;urely but much, and left the Matter
more intricate and perplexed than He found it. He was entirely governed
by Mr. <HI>Coventry,</HI> who &s;till learned enough of him to offer any Thing ra|tionally
in the Debate, or to cro&s;s what was not agreeable to his own
Fancy, by which He was &s;till &s;wayed out of the Pride and Perver&s;ene&s;s
of his Will.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20">UPON Debate and Conference with the&s;e Men, the Duke brought Pro|po&s;itions
to the King reduced into Writing by Mr. <HI>Coventry;</HI> and the King
commonly con&s;ulted them with the Lord Trea&s;urer in his Pre&s;ence, the
Propo&s;itions being commonly for Increa&s;e of the Expen&s;e, which Mr. <HI>Co|ventry</HI>
was &s;olicitous by all the Ways po&s;&s;ible to contrive. To tho&s;e Con&s;ul|tations
the Duke always brought the Sea-Officers, and Mr. <HI>Coventry,</HI> who
&s;pake much more than They, to explain e&s;pecially what Sir <HI>William Pen</HI> &s;aid,
who took upon him&s;elf to &s;peak mo&s;t, and often what the others had never
thought though They dur&s;t not contradict; and Sir <HI>John Law&s;on</HI> often
complained, &startq;that Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> put that in Writing which had never been
<MILESTONE N="30">propo&s;ed by them, and would continue di&s;puting it till They yielded.&endq;
Every Conference rai&s;ed the Charge very much; and what They propo&s;ed
Ye&s;terday as enough was To-day made twice as much; if They propo&s;ed
&s;ix Fire-Ships to be provided, within two or three Days They demanded
twelve: So there could be no po&s;&s;ible Computation of the Charge.</P>
<P>BY this Means the Fleet that was now ready to put to Sea amounted
to four&s;core Sail;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke puts out to Sea.</NOTE> and the King willingly con&s;ented, upon the Rea&s;ons
the Duke pre&s;ented to him, that they &s;hould &s;et Sail as &s;oon as was po&s;&s;ible.
And before the End of <HI>April</HI> the Duke was with the whole Fleet at Sea,
and vi&s;ited the Coa&s;t of <HI>Holland,</HI> and took many Ships in their View, their
<MILESTONE N="40">Fleet being not yet in Readine&s;s.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Many Noble|men go as Vo|lunteers.</NOTE> Many Noblemen, the Earl of <HI>Peterbo|rough,</HI>
the Lord Vi&s;count <HI>Ferrers,</HI> and others, with many Gentlemen of
Quality, went as Volunteers, and were di&s;tributed into the &s;everal Ships
with much Countenance by the Duke, and as many taken into his own
Ship as could be done with Convenience.</P>
<P>THE Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> had from the fir&s;t Mention of the War,
which He promoted all He could, declared &startq;that He would make one in
&startq;it:&endq; And when it was declared, He de&s;ired to have the Command of a
Ship, which the Duke po&s;itively denied to give him, except the King com|manded
it (and his Maje&s;ty was content to refer that, as He did the Nomi|nation
<MILESTONE N="50">of all the other Officers, to his Brother), and did not think fit that
a Man, of what Quality &s;oever, who had never been at Sea, &s;hould his
fir&s;t Voyage have the Command of any con&s;iderable Ship (and a &s;mall
one had not been for his Honour); at which He was much troubled.
<PB N="252" REF="257">
Yet his Friends told him that He was too far engaged, to &s;tay at Home
when his Royal Highne&s;s ventured his own Per&s;on: And thereupon He re|&s;olved
to go a Volunteer, and put him&s;elf on Board a Flag-Ship, the
Captain whereof was in his Favour. And then He de&s;ired, &startq;that in Re&s;pect
of his Quality, and his being a Privy Coun&s;ellor, He might be pre&s;ent in
all Councils of War.&endq; The Duke thought this not rea&s;onable, and would
not make a new Precedent. There were many of the ancient Nobility,
Earls and Barons, who were then on Board as Volunteers; and if the Con|&s;ideration
of Quality might entitle them to be pre&s;ent in Council, all Orders
would be broken, there being none called but Flag-Officers: And therefore<MILESTONE N="10">
his Royal Highne&s;s po&s;itively refu&s;ed to gratify him in that Point; which
the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> thought (it being enough known that the Duke
had neither E&s;teem or Kindne&s;s for him) to be &s;uch a per&s;onal Di&s;obligation,
that would well excu&s;e him for declining the Enterpri&s;e. And pretending
that He did appeal to the King in Point of Right, He left the Fleet, and
returned to the Shore to complain. And We return back too to the View
of other Particulars.</P>
<P>THERE were two Per&s;ons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some new Peers made.</NOTE> whom the King and his Brother did de&s;ire to
make remarkable by &s;ome extraordinary Favours: One of which was equally
grateful to Both,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sir</HI> Charles Berkley <HI>created Earl of</HI> Falmouth.</NOTE> Sir <HI>Charles Berkley,</HI> who had been lately created an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI><MILESTONE N="20">
Vi&s;count by the Name of Lord <HI>Fitzharding,</HI> the old and true Surname of
the Family; upon whom the King had, for Rea&s;ons only known to him|&s;elf,
fet his Affection &s;o much, that He had never denied any Thing He
a&s;ked for him&s;elf or for any Body el&s;e, and was well content that He &s;hould
be looked upon as his Favourite. He had been long thought &s;o to the Duke,
who was willing to promote any Thing to his Advantage: And the King
had deferred tho&s;e In&s;tances only till the Parliament &s;hould be prorogued,
left it &s;hould rai&s;e the Appetites of others to make Suits, which He had hi|therto
defended him&s;elf from, by declaring He would make no more Lords.
But the Parliament was no &s;ooner prorogued, than it was re&s;olved to be put<MILESTONE N="30">
in Execution: And when it was to be done, the Chancellor had the Ho|nour
to be pre&s;ent alone with the King and Duke, when it &s;eemed to be
fir&s;t thought of. And when the Duke propo&s;ed it as a Suit to the King,
that He would make the Lord <HI>Fitzharding</HI> an Earl, extolling his Courage
and Affection to the King; He was plea&s;ed with the Motion to that De|gree,
that He extolled him with Prai&s;es which could be applied to few Men:
And it was quickly re&s;olved that He &s;hould be an Earl of <HI>England,</HI> and a
Title was as &s;oon found out; and &s;o He was created Earl of <HI>Falmouth,</HI> be|fore
He had one Foot of Land in the World.</P>
<P>AND to gratify the King for this Favour,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And sir</HI> H. Bennet <HI>Lord</HI> Arlington.</NOTE> the Duke likewi&s;e propo&s;ed<MILESTONE N="40">
that the King would make Sir <HI>Harry Bennet</HI> a Lord, whom all the World
knew He did not care for; which was as willingly granted: And He
had no more E&s;tate than the other, and could not &s;o ea&s;ily find a Title for
his Barony. But becau&s;e He had no Mind to retain his own Name, which
was no good one, his fir&s;t Warrant was to be created <HI>Cheney,</HI> which was
an ancient Barony expired, and to which Family He had not the lea&s;t Re|lation:
And for &s;ome Days upon the &s;igning the Warrant He was called
Lord <HI>Cheney,</HI> until a Gentleman of the be&s;t Quality in <HI>Buckingham&s;hire,</HI>
who though He had no Title to the Barony was yet of the &s;ame Family,
and inherited mo&s;t Part of the E&s;tate, which was very con&s;iderable, and<MILESTONE N="50">
was married to a Daughter of the Duke of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> heard of it, and
made Ha&s;te to &s;top it. He went fir&s;t to Sir <HI>Harry Bennet</HI> him&s;elf, and
de&s;ired him &startq;not to affect a Title to which He had no Relation; and to
<PB N="253" REF="258">
which though He could not pretend of direct Right, yet He was not &s;o
ob&s;cure but that him&s;elf or a Son of his might hereafter be thought worthy
of it by the Crown; and in that Re&s;pect it would be &s;ome Trouble to
him to &s;ee it ve&s;ted in the Family of a Stranger.&endq; The Secretary did not
give him &s;o civil an An&s;wer as He expected, having no Knowledge of the
Gentleman. Yet &s;hortly after, upon Information of his Condition and
Quality (as He was in all Re&s;pects very worthy of Con&s;ideration), the Pa|tent
being not yet prepared, He was contented to take the Title of a little
Farm that had belonged to his Father and was &s;old by him, and now in the
<MILESTONE N="10">Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another private Per&s;on; and &s;o was created Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI>
the proper and true Name of the Place being <HI>Harlington,</HI> a little Village
between <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Uxbridge.</HI></P>
<P>THE King took the Occa&s;ion to make the&s;e two Noblemen from an
Obligation that lay upon him to confer two Honours at the &s;ame Time;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Fre&s;che|ville <HI>created Lord</HI> Fre&s;che|ville.</NOTE>
the one upon Mr. <HI>Fre&s;cheville,</HI> of a very ancient Family in <HI>Derby&s;hire</HI> and
a fair E&s;tate, who had been always bred in the Court, a menial Servant of
the la&s;t King, and had &s;erved him in the Head of a Troop of Hor&s;e rai&s;ed
at his own Charge in the War, and whom his late Maje&s;ty had promi&s;ed to
make a Baron.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20">THE other was Mr. <HI>Richard Arundel</HI> of <HI>Trerice</HI> in <HI>Cornwall,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And Mr.</HI> Ri|chard Arun|del <HI>Lord</HI> A|rundel <HI>of</HI> Tre|rice.</NOTE> a Gentle|man
as well known by what He had done and &s;uffered in the late Time, as
by the Eminency of his Family, and the Fortune He was &s;till Ma&s;ter of af|ter

them, and gave the fir&s;t Turn and Oppo&s;ition to the Current of the

Succe&s;s that the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> had afterwards was ju&s;tly to be imputed as
<MILESTONE N="30">to the fir&s;t Ri&s;e. The old Gentleman was then above &s;eventy Years of
Age, and infirm; but all his Sons He engaged in the War: The two
elde&s;t were eminent Officers, Both Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons,
and the more zealous Soldiers by having been Witne&s;&s;es of the naughty Pro|ceedings
of tho&s;e who had rai&s;ed the Rebellion. The elde&s;t was killed in
the Head of his Troop, charging and driving back a bold Sally that was
made out of <HI>Plymouth</HI> when it was be&s;ieged: And this other Gentleman of
whom We now &s;peak, and who was then the younger Brother, was an ex|cellent
Colonel of Foot to the End of the War.</P>
<P>WHEN Sir <HI>Nicholas Slanning,</HI> who was Governour of <HI>Pendennis,</HI> lo&s;t his
<MILESTONE N="40">Life bravely in the Siege of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> the King knew not into what Hands to
commit that important Place &s;o &s;ecurely, as by &s;ending a Commi&s;&s;ion to old
<HI>John Arundel</HI> of <HI>Trerice</HI> to command, well knowing that it mu&s;t be pre&s;erved
principally by his Intere&s;t; and in Re&s;pect of his Age joined his elde&s;t Son
with him: And after his Death He added the younger Brother to the Com|mand,
of whom We are &s;peaking, who was in Truth then looked upon as
the mo&s;t powerful Per&s;on in that County.</P>
<P>WHEN the King, then Prince, was compelled after almo&s;t the whole
<HI>We&s;t</HI> was lo&s;t to retire into <HI>Cornwall,</HI> He remained in <HI>Pendennis Ca&s;tle,</HI> and
from thence made his fir&s;t Embarcation to <HI>Scilly:</HI> And at parting, out of a
<MILESTONE N="50">princely Sen&s;e of the Affection and Service of that Family, He took the old
Gentleman a&s;ide, and in the Pre&s;ence of his Son wi&s;hed him &startq;to defend
the Place as long as He could, becau&s;e Relief might come, of which there
was &s;ome Hope from abroad;&endq; and promi&s;ed him, &startq;if He lived to come
<PB N="254" REF="259">
back into <HI>England</HI> He would make him a Baron, and if He were dead
He would make it good to his Son.&endq; The old Man behaved him bravely
to his Death, having all his E&s;tate taken from him; and his Son remained
as eminently faithful, and had as deep Marks of it as any Man: So that
at the King's Return, who never forgat his Promi&s;e, He might have
received the Effect of it in the fir&s;t Creation, if He had de&s;ired it; but He
cho&s;e rather to recover the Brui&s;es his Fortune had endured by Seizures and
Seque&s;trations, before He would embark him in a Condition that mu&s;t pre|&s;ently
rai&s;e his Expen&s;e in his Way of Living. And as &s;oon as He found
him&s;elf at Ea&s;e in that Re&s;pect, He got a Friend to inform the King, &startq;that<MILESTONE N="10">
He was ready to receive his Bounty.&endq;</P>
<P>AND his Maje&s;ty, being under the&s;e two Obligations, was willing to
take the &s;ame Opportunity to prefer the two other Per&s;ons He loved &s;o well.
But at the &s;ame Time that He declared his Re&s;olution for the la&s;t two (but
what concerned the others had been long known and expected), his Maje&s;ty
reflected upon the Number of the Hou&s;e of Peers, which was in many Re|&s;pects
found grievous, and declared to his Brother and the Chancellor, who
were only pre&s;ent, &startq;that no Importunity &s;hould prevail with him to make
any more Lords in many Years, and till the pre&s;ent Number &s;hould be
le&s;&s;ened;&endq; in which Re&s;olution the Duke willingly concurred, and pro|te&s;ted<MILESTONE N="20">
&startq;that He would never more importune him in that Point.&endq; The
Rea&s;on of mentioning this Declaration and Re&s;olution will appear hereafter.
This Creation was no &s;ooner over, than the new Earl of <HI>Falmouth</HI> went with

King and near his Per&s;on, yet He thought him&s;elf obliged not to be from

confe&s;&s;ed by all Men to abound in a mo&s;t fearle&s;s Courage.</P>
<P>IT will not be un&s;ea&s;onable in this Place to take a View of an Act of
State that pa&s;&s;ed about this Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A particular Relation of pa&s;&s;ing the</HI> Ca|nary <HI>Patent.</HI></NOTE> and which afterwards admini&s;tered Matter
of Reproach again&s;t the Chancellor, and was made U&s;e of by his Enemies<MILESTONE N="30">
as an Evidence of his Corruption; for the better under&s;tanding whereof, it
will be nece&s;&s;ary to begin the Relation from the original Ground of the Coun|&s;el.
About the fir&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> after the King's happy Return into <HI>England,</HI>
the Chancellor, Trea&s;urer, Privy Seal, and the two Chief Ju&s;tices (being the
Per&s;ons appointed by the Statute for that Purpo&s;e) met together to &s;et the
Prices upon the &s;everal Sorts of Wines; and were attended, according to
Cu&s;tom, by the Company of Vintners, and the chief Merchants in the City
who traded in that Commodity. And being fir&s;t to limit the Merchants to
a rea&s;onable Rate, before They could pre&s;cribe any Price to the Vintners
upon the Retail, They found, by the be&s;t Enquiry They could make, that<MILESTONE N="40">
the fir&s;t Prices beyond the Seas which the Merchants paid for their Wines
were &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that the Retail could not be brought within any Com|pa&s;s;
and that &s;ince the Beginning of the Troubles the Price of Wines in
general was exceedingly increa&s;ed, and particularly that of the <HI>Canaries</HI> was
almo&s;t double to what it had been in the Year 1640.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor knew very well, by the Corre&s;pondence He had held in
the <HI>Canaries</HI> (during the Time that He had &s;erved his Maje&s;ty as his Am|ba&s;&s;adour
in <HI>Spain</HI>), that the whole Trade for the <HI>Canary</HI> Wine was driven
&s;olely by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and the Commodity entirely vended in the King's
Dominions, all <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> be&s;ide not &s;pending any Quantity of that Wine:<MILESTONE N="50">
And thereupon He a&s;ked the Merchants &startq;whether what He had reported was
not true, and what would be the Way to remedy that Mi&s;chief.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="260">
THEY all confe&s;&s;ed it to be very true, and &startq;that it was a great Reproach
to the Nation to be &s;o much impo&s;ed upon in a Trade that They might
govern them&s;elves: And that the unrea&s;onable Prices of the Wine were not
the greate&s;t Prejudice that was befallen that Trade. That before the Troubles
They had been &s;o far from employing any Stock of Money for the Support
of that Traffick, that They u&s;ed to &s;end their Ships fully laden with all
Commodities thither, which yielded very good Markets, being &s;ent from
thence into the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> with their <HI>Plate</HI> Fleets; and that the very
Pipe-Staves which They carried did very near &s;upply the Value of their
<MILESTONE N="10">Wine, &s;o that They brought Home the Proceed of their Commodities
either in Pieces of <HI>Eight,</HI> or &s;uch other Merchandi&s;es as had been brought
thither from the <HI>Indies,</HI> and upon which They received great Profit. On
the contrary, that the Trade was now wholly driven by ready Money;
that the Commodities They &s;end thither are not taken off, except at their
own Prices, &s;o that They have for the late Years &s;ent their Ve&s;&s;els empty
thither, except only with &s;ome few Pipe-Staves, which by the De&s;truction
in <HI>Ireland</HI> They could not &s;end in any great Proportion; and that their
Ships return from thence with no other Lading but tho&s;e Wines, which
They trade for in ready Money, either by Pieces of <HI>Eight</HI> &s;ent in their
<MILESTONE N="20">Ships from hence, or by Bills of Exchange charged upon &s;ome known
Merchants in <HI>Spain.</HI> That over and above the&s;e Di&s;advantages, the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> in tho&s;e I&s;lands had of late impo&s;ed new Duties upon the Wine,
and laid other Impo&s;itions upon the Merchants than the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation
had been ever accu&s;tomed to.&endq; They &s;aid, &startq;all the&s;e Inconveniences pro|ceeded
from the immoderate Appetite this Nation hath for that Sort of
Wine, and therefore They take from them as much as They can make;
and from our own Di&s;order and Irregularity in buying them, and con|tending
who &s;hall get the mo&s;t, and &s;o rai&s;ing the Price upon one ano|ther,
and making the <HI>Spaniards</HI> them&s;elves the Judges what the Mer|chants
<MILESTONE N="30">&s;hall pay.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Lords, upon Con&s;ultation between them&s;elves, found the Matter
too hard for them, and that the Reformation of &s;o much Evil mu&s;t be
made by Degrees, and upon a Repre&s;entation of the Whole, with the Dif|ficulties
which attended it, to the King and his Privy Council, who&s;e Wi&s;|doms
only could provide a Remedy proportionable to the Mi&s;chiefs. For the
pre&s;ent, as They re&s;olved not to rai&s;e the Prices at which Wine was at that
Time bought and &s;old (which They believed, how rea&s;onably &s;oever it
might be done, would yet be very unpopular), &s;o They thought it not ju&s;t
to draw down and abate tho&s;e Prices, &s;ince it appeared to them that the
<MILESTONE N="40">Wines co&s;t more in Proportion upon the Places of their Growth. They
declared therefore to the Merchants and to the Vintners, &startq;that though for
the pre&s;ent They would permit the &s;ame Prices to continue for the next
Year, which they had been &s;old for the pre&s;ent Year,&endq; and which indeed
were confirmed by the late Act of Parliament, &startq;They &s;hould hereafter take
Care what Markets They made; for that They were re&s;olved the next
Year to make the Prices much lower both to the Merchant and to the
Vintner:&endq; And &s;o, upon the Report made by the Lords of the whole
Matter to the King in Council, and of what They thought fit to be done
for the pre&s;ent, a Proclamation was publi&s;hed accordingly.</P>
<MILESTONE N="50">
<P>THE next Year both the Merchants and Vintners were very earne&s;t Suitors
to the Lords at their accu&s;tomed Meeting, that greater Prices might be
allowed, or at lea&s;t that the &s;ame might be continued; making it very evi|dent,
that their Wines co&s;t them more than they had done the Year before.
<PB N="256" REF="261">
Upon the Debate the <HI>Canary</HI> Merchants were much divided. Some of
them in&s;i&s;ted very importunately to have the Price rai&s;ed, &startq;becau&s;e it was
notorious that They had paid much more than formerly, by Rea&s;on,&endq; as
They alleged, &startq;that the Vintage had not yielded near the Proportion that
it u&s;ed to do.&endq; Others, though confe&s;&s;ing the Increa&s;e of Price, yet pre|tended
a more publick Spirit and the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Reformation: And
therefore They pre&s;&s;ed as earne&s;tly, &startq;that the Price might not be rai&s;ed,
but that They might be permitted to take what They had done already
for this Year.&endq; It was quickly di&s;covered whence this Moderation proceeded;
and that the la&s;t Propo&s;ers had a great Quantity of Wine upon their Hands,<MILESTONE N="10">
which had been provided the Year before, and &s;o might well be &s;old at
the &s;ame Price; but that the former had no old Wine left, but were &s;up|plied
with a full Provi&s;ion of new, which had co&s;t them &s;o much dearer.
Both the one and the other de&s;ired the Lords, &startq;that whatever Re&s;olution
They took for the pre&s;ent, a Clau&s;e might be in&s;erted in the Proclama|tion,
<HI>That, the next Year which followed,</HI> Canary <HI>Wine &s;hould not be &s;old for
above four and twenty Pounds the Pipe, and that every Year after it &s;hould
be drawn lower,</HI>&endq; as it might well be, it having been &s;old in the Year
1640 for twenty Pounds the Pipe; though, in the Year when his Maje&s;ty
returned, it had been permitted to be &s;old at &s;ix and thirty Pounds the Pipe.<MILESTONE N="20">
&startq;Such a Clau&s;e,&endq; They &s;aid, &startq;would give Notice to the I&s;landers, and
oblige them to &s;ell their Wines at more rea&s;onable Rates, and would ren|der
the Merchants unexcu&s;able if They &s;hould give greater.&endq; Notwith|&s;tanding
all their Allegations, the Lords remembered what They had de|clared
to them the la&s;t Year, which was as fair a Warning as any Thing
They could now &s;ay would be. And accordingly They &s;et lower Prices
upon all Wines for the Year to come than had been allowed the la&s;t, as the
mo&s;t effectual Warning for the future: Which was thought a very rigorous
Proceeding; but being reported to the King and Council, what They had
done was allowed and confirmed, and his Maje&s;ty was well contented that<MILESTONE N="30">
&s;uch a Clau&s;e as They had propo&s;ed &s;hould be in&s;erted in the Proclamation;
which was accordingly done.</P>
<P>THE Year following, when the Lords met again according to Cu&s;tom,
which is as hath been &s;aid about <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> They found not the lea&s;t Reforma|tion;
on the contrary, that the <HI>Canary</HI> Merchants had paid dearer than
ever, which made them all more &s;olicitous to have the Price rai&s;ed, and the
Vintners as importunate for their Retail. And indeed the Vintners &s;eemed
to be in a much wor&s;e Condition than the Merchants. And They made
it appear, &startq;that They were often compelled to pay higher Prices to the
Merchant than were impo&s;ed by their Lord&s;hips; without which They<MILESTONE N="40">
could get no good Wine, and &s;o mu&s;t give over their keeping Hou&s;e:
That the Penalty upon the Merchant was very &s;mall, being not above
forty Shillings a Pipe, and the Crime not ea&s;y to be di&s;covered, as was
evident by there not having been one Merchant que&s;tioned in many Years
for that common Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; whereas on the Vintner's Part the Pe|nalty
was very &s;evere, and ea&s;ily di&s;covered by any Man who went to a
Tavern and would be an Informer, and that mo&s;t of the Vintners in
<HI>London</HI> were at that very Time &s;ued in the <HI>Exchequer</HI> upon tho&s;e very
Penalties, which if exacted mu&s;t produce their Ruin.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Merchants excu&s;ed them&s;elves for their pre&s;ent Pretence, and for<MILESTONE N="50">
their having given more for their Wines than was lawful for them to have
done by their own De&s;ire: &startq;That They had done their be&s;t, and that the
greate&s;t Traders among&s;t them had con&s;ented between them&s;elves not to
<PB N="257" REF="262">
&s;uffer the Prices to be rai&s;ed upon them; but that They found it ineffec|tual,
and that though They &s;hould give over their Trades it would pro|duce
no Reformation. That the Trade was open to all Adventurers, and
that there had been many Ships &s;ent from <HI>England</HI> in that very Year by
<HI>Jews,</HI> and People of &s;everal Trades, who had never been before known to
trade to the <HI>Canaries:</HI> In&s;omuch as when They who had been long bred
up to the Trade, and had been long Factors in tho&s;e I&s;lands, &s;ent their
Ships thither, They found other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships there, and the Wines
bought at a greater Price than They had allowed their Factors to give;
<MILESTONE N="10">&s;o that They mu&s;t either have their Ships return empty and unladen, or
take the Wines at the Prices other Men gave. That They had cho&s;en
the latter, as well to continue their Trade, as to draw Home &s;ome Part
of the Stock They had in that Country. That They could imagine but
two Ways to reform that Exce&s;s: The one, by putting the Trade into
&s;uch a Method and under &s;uch Rules, as might re&s;train that Licen&s;e,
and not leave it in the Power of Per&s;ons who never had been in the Trade
to give the Law to it; and by this Means the I&s;landers would find it nece&s;|&s;ary
to &s;et rea&s;onable Prices upon their Commodities, and to yield &s;uch
other Advantages and Privileges to the Merchants as They had heretofore
<MILESTONE N="20">enjoyed. The other, that the King would by his Proclamation prohibit
the Importation of any <HI>Canary</HI> Wines into his Dominions: And hereby
He would quickly receive &s;uch Propo&s;itions from <HI>Spain,</HI> as would put it
into his own Power to make the Reformation; otherwi&s;e the I&s;landers had
been per&s;uaded that <HI>England</HI> could not live without their Wines.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Lords were re&s;olved, notwith&s;tanding all that had been &s;aid, that
They would execute the former Proclamation, and reduce the Prices of
Wines to what had been then determined: And after They had given a
full Account of the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s to the King in Council, the Re&s;olution
was approved, and a Proclamation was i&s;&s;ued out to that Purpo&s;e. The
<MILESTONE N="30">Merchants and Vintners applied them&s;elves to his Maje&s;ty, and to many of
the Lords of the Council, and thought They had Encouragement enough to
hope for a Relief in an Appeal to the King and Council by Petition; and
They had thereupon a Day a&s;&s;igned to be heard. Many of the Lords thought
it very hard, if not unju&s;t, to compel Men to &s;ell cheaper than They bought,
which was the Truth of the Ca&s;e, and which mu&s;t oblige both Merchants
and Vintners to &s;ophi&s;ticate and corrupt their Wines to pre&s;erve their E&s;tates;
which might probably turn to the great Damage of the whole Kingdom,
in producing Sickne&s;s and Di&s;ea&s;es: And this charitable and generous Con|&s;ideration
prevailed with the major Part of the Lords to be well contented,
<MILESTONE N="40">and to wi&s;h that &s;ome Indulgence might be exerci&s;ed towards them. On
the contrary, when the King had well weighed the whole Proceedings, and
with Trouble and Indignation con&s;idered the ob&s;tinate Vice of the Nation,
which made it ridiculous to all the World, He expre&s;&s;ed a po&s;itive Re&s;olu|tion
to vindicate him&s;elf and his Government from this Reproach. He
thought the adhering firmly to the Prices which had been re&s;olved upon by
the Lords would be the be&s;t Preface to this Reformation, though it might be
attended with particular Damage to particular Per&s;ons, who had yet le&s;s
Cau&s;e to complain, becau&s;e their own Advice had been followed. And
thereupon his Maje&s;ty declared, &startq;that He would make no Alteration;&endq; but
<MILESTONE N="50">withal told them, &startq;that if They could make any Propo&s;ition to him for
the better Regulation of the Trade&endq; (for They had them&s;elves mentioned
a Charter), &startq;He would graciou&s;ly receive any Propo&s;itions They would
make, and gratify them in what was ju&s;t:&endq; And &s;o, notwith&s;tanding all
<PB N="258" REF="263">
Attempts which were often repeated, the Price &s;et by the Lords was ratified
for the Year following.</P>
<P>SHORTLY after,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The principal</HI> Canary <HI>Mer|chants petition for a Charter.</HI></NOTE> many of the Merchants who had always traded to the <HI>Ca|naries</HI>
did petition the King, &startq;that They might be incorporated; and that
none might be permitted to trade thither but &s;uch who would be of that
Corporation, and ob&s;erve the Con&s;titutions which &s;hould be made by
them:&endq; Which Petition was pre&s;ented to the King at the Council-Board;
and being read, his Maje&s;ty (according to his Cu&s;tom in Matters of Diffi|culty
and publick Concernment) directed it to be read again on that Day
Month, at which Time his Maje&s;ty pre&s;umed that all who would oppo&s;e it<MILESTONE N="10">
would pre&s;ent their Rea&s;ons and Objections again&s;t it, which He de&s;ired to
hear. At the Day appointed, though there was no Petition again&s;t it, yet
it was ob&s;erved that there were many of the mo&s;t eminent Merchants of that
Trade, who&s;e Names were not to the Petition, nor who otherwi&s;e appeared
de&s;irous to have a Charter granted: Which his Maje&s;ty con&s;idering, He put
off the Debate for another Week, and directed &startq;that the other Merchants
by Name &s;hould be de&s;ired to be pre&s;ent, and to give their Advice freely
upon the Point.&endq;</P>
<P>AND there was at that Day a very full Appearance; when his Maje&s;ty
directed, &startq;that a Relation &s;hould be made to them of the whole Progre&s;s<MILESTONE N="20">
that had been in the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and the Damage and Di&s;honour the Na|tion
underwent in the carrying on that Trade: That many Merchants had
pre&s;ented a Petition to him, containing an Expedient to bring it into
better Order; but finding them not to appear in it, and being informed
that They were be&s;t acquainted with and mo&s;t engaged in that Trade,
He had &s;ent for them to know their Opinion, whether They thought what
was propo&s;ed to be rea&s;onable and fit to be granted, and if &s;o, why They
did not concern them&s;elves in it.&endq; They an&s;wered, &startq;that the Rea&s;on
why They had not appeared in it was, becau&s;e They thought They
&s;hould be Lo&s;ers by it, and therefore were not &s;olicitous to procure a<MILESTONE N="30">
Grant from his Maje&s;ty to their own Damage;&endq; and &s;o enlarged &startq;upon
the Nature of the Trade, their long Experience in it, and the Greatne&s;s
of their Stock, which They &s;hould not be allowed to continue under any
Regulation. But as They did not think them&s;elves in a Situation to be
&s;olicitous for a Change, &s;o They could not deny, being required by his
Maje&s;ty to &s;peak the Truth, but that the Propo&s;ition that was made was
for the publick Good and Benefit of the Kingdom, and that They con|ceived
no other Way to redeem that Trade, and the Nation from the In|&s;olence
which the <HI>Spaniard</HI> exerci&s;ed upon them;&endq; implying, &startq;that if
his Maje&s;ty would command them, They would likewi&s;e concur and join<MILESTONE N="40">
in the carrying on the Service:&endq; To which his Maje&s;ty giving them gra|cious
Encouragement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King ap|proves the Pe|tition.</NOTE> They all &s;eemed to depart of one Mind; and his
Maje&s;ty remained confirmed in the former Opinion He had of it.</P>
<P>BUT there remained yet an Objection, which was principally in&s;i&s;ted on
by the Mini&s;ters of the Revenue, who alleged very rea&s;onably, &startq;that this
new-modelling the Trade mu&s;t produce &s;ome Alteration, and would meet
&s;ome Oppo&s;ition from the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> which for the Time would le&s;&s;en the
Cu&s;toms and entitle the Farmers to a Defalcation.&endq; The Petition was there|fore
referred to the Farmers of the Cu&s;toms, who were to attend the next
Council-Day: And being then called, They did acknowledge, &startq;that the<MILESTONE N="50">
De&s;ign propo&s;ed would prove very profitable to the Kingdom in many
Re&s;pects,&endq; upon which They enlarged, &startq;and that in the End it would
not be attended with any Diminutions of the Cu&s;toms; but for the pre&s;ent,&endq;
<PB N="259" REF="264">
They &s;aid, &startq;They could not but expect, that the Ob&s;tinacy and Con|tradiction
of the <HI>Spaniard</HI> would give &s;uch a Stop to Trade, at lea&s;t for
one Year, that if his Maje&s;ty did not reimbur&s;e them for what &s;hould fall
&s;hort in the Receipt of Cu&s;tom, They mu&s;t look to be very great Lo&s;ers.&endq;
The Merchants on the other Hand offered &startq;to be bound, that if They
did not the fir&s;t Year bring in as much as had been u&s;ually entered, They
would make good what &s;hould be wanting to the Farmers upon a Me|dium.&endq;
Whereupon his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf declared, &startq;that He would not,
for a &s;mall Damage to him&s;elf, hinder the Kingdom from enjoying &s;o great
<MILESTONE N="10">a Benefit:&endq; And He commanded his Solicitor General, who then attended
the Board, &startq;to prepare &s;uch a Charter as might provide for all tho&s;e good
Ends which were de&s;ired in the Petition,&endq; and which had been &s;o largely
debated; and it was notorious, that there had never been a greater Con|currence
of the Board in any Direction.</P>
<P>MANY Months pa&s;&s;ed before the Charter was prepared; in which Time
there was never the lea&s;t new Objection made again&s;t it, nor was it known
that any Man was un&s;atisfied with it. After it was engro&s;&s;ed and had
pa&s;&s;ed the King's Hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The City of</HI> London <HI>op|po&s;es it.</HI></NOTE> it was brought to the Great Seal; and there the Lord
Mayor of <HI>London</HI> and the Court of Aldermen had entered a Caveat to &s;top
<MILESTONE N="20">the pa&s;&s;ing of it. The Chancellor, according to Cour&s;e, appointed a Time
when He would hear all Parties. The City alleged an Order made a Year
or two before by the King in Council, upon a Complaint then exhibited by
the Court of Aldermen again&s;t the <HI>Turkey</HI> Company and other Corpora|tions,
&startq;in which&endq; They &s;aid &startq;there were very many Merchants of the
be&s;t Trade and of the greate&s;t E&s;tates in the City, who would never
take out their Freedom, and &s;o refu&s;ed to bear any Charge or Office
in it, to the very great Prejudice and Di&s;honour of the City and of
the Government thereof; &s;ince They were thereby compelled to call in|feriour
Citizens to be Aldermen, before They had E&s;tates to bear the
<MILESTONE N="30">Charge of it, whil&s;t the grave&s;t and the riche&s;t Men, who were mo&s;t
fit, could not be obliged to accept of it, becau&s;e They were not Free|men.&endq;
The Per&s;ons concerned, which were indeed a great Number of
very valuable and &s;ub&s;tantial Men and of great E&s;tates, an&s;wered, &startq;that They
had traded very many Years without finding any Rea&s;on to take out their
Freedom, which They might do or not do as They thought be&s;t for them|&s;elves;
that They had always paid Scot and Lot in the &s;everal Pari&s;hes
where They lived with the highe&s;t of the Inhabitants, and were taxed the
more becau&s;e They had not taken out their Freedom, They who taxed
them being always Freemen; that They were grown old now, and had
<MILESTONE N="40">no Mind to become young Freemen, but would rather give over their
Trade, and retire into the Country where They had E&s;tates.&endq;</P>
<P>BESIDES the Rules which the King gave upon the Difference then in
Que&s;tion, He was plea&s;ed to declare, and appointed it to be entered as an
Order in the Council-Book, &startq;that Care &s;hould be taken, that in all Char|ters
which He &s;hould hereafter renew or grant to any Companies or
Corporations in the City of <HI>London,</HI> They &s;hould fir&s;t make them&s;elves
Freemen of the City; by which They might be liable to the Charges of
it, as other Citizens are.&endq; They &s;aid, &startq;that there were many of this
Company that was now to be incorporated who were not Freemen:&endq; And
<MILESTONE N="50">therefore the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen de&s;ired the Benefit of the
King's Order, which was read.</P>
<P>THE Merchants confe&s;&s;ed, &startq;that many of them were not Freemen, and
re&s;olved not to be:&endq; They &s;aid, &startq;They had never heard of this Order, and
<PB N="260" REF="265">
were &s;orry that They had &s;pent &s;o much Money to no Purpo&s;e.&endq; The
Chancellor declared to them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancellor refu&s;es to put the Seal till the Merchants had &s;atisfied the City.</NOTE> &startq;that He could not &s;eal their Charter till
They had complied with the King's Determination, and given the Court
of Aldermen Satisfaction;&endq; and They all &s;eemed as po&s;itive that They
would rather be without their Charter, than They would &s;ubmit to the other
Inconveniences: And &s;o They departed. But after &s;ome Days Deliberation
and Con&s;ultation between them&s;elves, and when They found that there was
no Po&s;&s;ibility to procure a Di&s;pen&s;ation from that Order, They treated with
the City, and agreed with them in the preparing a Clau&s;e to be in&s;erted in
their Charter, by which They were obliged in &s;o many Years to become<MILESTONE N="10">
Freemen; which Clau&s;e, being approved by all Parties, was in the King's Pre|&s;ence
entered in the Bill that his Maje&s;ty had &s;igned, and being afterwards
added to the Engro&s;&s;ment, it was again thus reformed and &s;ent to the Great
Seal, and pre&s;ented to the Chancellor to be &s;ealed.</P>
<P>THERE were by this Time &s;everal new Caveats entered again&s;t it at the
Seal; all which the Chancellor heard, and &s;ettled every one of them to the
joint Satisfaction of all Parties, and all Caveats were withdrawn. There
was then a Rumour, that there would be &s;ome Motions made again&s;t it in
the Hou&s;e of Commons: And &s;ome Parliament-Men, who &s;erved for the
We&s;tern Boroughs, came to the Chancellor, and de&s;ired him &startq;that He<MILESTONE N="20">
would defer the &s;ealing it for &s;ome Days till They might be heard, &s;ince
it would undo their We&s;tern Trade; and&endq; They &s;aid &startq;They re&s;olved to
move the Hou&s;e of Commons to put a Stop to it.&endq; The Chancellor in|formed
them of the whole Progre&s;s it had pa&s;&s;ed, and told them, &startq;He be|lieved
that They would hardly be able to offer any good Rea&s;ons again&s;t
it:&endq; However, &s;ince it was then well known that the Parliament would
be prorogued within ten or twelve Days, He &s;aid &startq;He would &s;u&s;pend the
&s;ealing it till then, to the End that They might offer any Objections again&s;t
it there or any where el&s;e.&endq; But though the Parliament &s;ate longer than
it was then conceived it would have done, there was no Mention or Notice<MILESTONE N="30">
taken of it: And after the Prorogation no Application was farther made for
the &s;topping it, and the Merchants pre&s;&s;ed very importunately that it might
be &s;ealed, alleging with Rea&s;on &startq;that the deferring it &s;o long had been very
much to their Prejudice.&endq; Whereupon the Chancellor conceived that it
would not con&s;i&s;t with his Duty to delay it longer, and &s;o affixed the Great
Seal to it.</P>
<P>THE Company then cho&s;e a Governour and other Officers according to
their Charter, and made &s;uch Orders and By-Laws as They thought fit for
the carrying on and Advancement of their Trade, which They might alter
when They thought convenient; and for the pre&s;ent They re&s;olved upon a<MILESTONE N="40">
joint Stock, and a&s;&s;igned &s;o many Shares to each particular Mart. In this
Compo&s;ition and Di&s;tribution there &s;ell out &s;ome Difference between them|&s;elves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some Differ|ences in the Company after their Incorpo|ration.</NOTE>
which could not be taken Notice of abroad: And even &s;ome of
them, who fir&s;t petitioned and were mo&s;t &s;olicitous to procure the Charter,
did what They could to hinder the Effect of it; &s;ent privately to their Fac|tors
at the <HI>Canaries,</HI> &startq;to oppo&s;e any Orders that &s;hould be &s;ent from the
Governour and the Company, and that They &s;hould do all They could
to incen&s;e the <HI>Spaniards</HI> again&s;t the Charter,&endq; and bade them promi&s;e
that all their Wine &s;hould be taken off in Spite of the Corporation.&endq;
Whereupon great Di&s;orders did ari&s;e in the <HI>Canaries</HI> between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI><MILESTONE N="50">
them&s;elves; and by the Conjunction of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> with tho&s;e few <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI>
who oppo&s;ed the Charter, They proceeded &s;o far as to &s;end the prin|cipal
Factors for the Company out of the I&s;land into <HI>Spain,</HI> and to make
<PB N="261" REF="266">
a publick Act by the Governour and Council there, &startq;that no Ship belong|ing
to the Company &s;hould be &s;uffered to come into the Harbour, or to
take in any Lading from the I&s;land:&endq; All which was tran&s;acted there
many Months before it was known in <HI>England,</HI> and probably would have
been prevented or ea&s;ily reformed, if it had not plea&s;ed God that the
Plague at this Time &s;pread very much in <HI>London,</HI> and if the War with the
<HI>Dutch</HI> had not re&s;trained all <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships from going to the <HI>Canaries</HI> for
the Space of a Year; which Intermi&s;&s;ion, not to be prevented nor in Truth
fore&s;een, gave &s;ome Advantage to the Merchants at Home who oppo&s;ed their
<MILESTONE N="10">Charter, who complained for the Not-Return of their &s;everal Stocks within
the Time that the Company had promi&s;ed they &s;hould be returned.</P>
<P>I AM not willing to re&s;ume this Di&s;cour&s;e in another Place, which I
&s;hould be compelled to do if I di&s;continued the Relation in this Place, as in
Point of Time I &s;hould do; but I choo&s;e rather to in&s;ert here what fell out
afterwards, and to fini&s;h the Account of that Affair, that there may be no
Occa&s;ion in the Current of this Narration to mention any Particulars that re|lated
to it.</P>
<P>WHEN the King was at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and was informed of what had pa&s;&s;ed
at the <HI>Canaries,</HI> &s;ome Merchants appeared there to petition again&s;t the
<MILESTONE N="20">Charter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which are re|ferred to the King.</NOTE> whereof there were &s;ome who were the fir&s;t Petitioners for it. His
Maje&s;ty appointed a Day for the &s;olemn hearing it in the Pre&s;ence of his
Privy Council, the Governour being likewi&s;e &s;ummoned and pre&s;ent there.
Upon opening all their Grievances the Petitioners them&s;elves confe&s;&s;ed, &startq;that
They could not complain of the Charter; that it was a ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary
Charter, and for the great Benefit of the Kingdom, though &s;ome private
Men might for the pre&s;ent be Lo&s;ers by it: That their Complaint was
only again&s;t their Con&s;titutions and By-Laws, and the &s;evere Pro&s;e|cution
thereupon contrary to the Intention of the Charter it&s;elf;&endq; in|&s;tancing,
among&s;t other Things, &startq;the very &s;hort Day limited by the Char|ter,
<MILESTONE N="30">after which They could not continue their Trade without being Mem|bers
of the Corporation; and that Day was &s;o &s;oon after the &s;ealing the
Charter, that it was not po&s;&s;ible for them to draw their Stocks from thence
in &s;o &s;hort a Time.&endq;</P>
<P>WHEN They had fini&s;hed all their Objections, the King ob&s;erved to them,
&startq;that They complained only of what them&s;elves had done, and not at all of
the Charter, which gave them only Authority to choo&s;e a Governour and to
make Con&s;titutions and By-Laws, but directed not what the Con&s;titutions
and By-Laws &s;hould be, which were the Re&s;ult of their own Con&s;ultations,
in which the major Part mu&s;t have concurred; and of that Kind the Re&s;o|lution
<MILESTONE N="40">for a joint Stock was one, which and all the re&s;t They might alter
again at the next Court, if the major Part were grieved with it.&endq; But
becau&s;e They had complained of &s;ome Particulars, in which They might
have Rea&s;on on their Side, his Maje&s;ty expre&s;&s;ed a Willingne&s;s to mediate
and to make an Agreement between them: And thereupon He required
the Governour to an&s;wer &s;uch and &s;uch Particulars which &s;eemed to have
mo&s;t of Ju&s;tice; but the Governour an&s;wered all at large, and made it
clearly appear, that They had in Truth no Cau&s;e of Complaint. As to the
&s;hort Day that was a&s;&s;igned for the drawing away of their Stocks, which
had the greate&s;t Semblance of Rea&s;on in all They complained of, He &s;aid,
<MILESTONE N="50">&startq;They had no Rea&s;on to mention their Want of Warning, for that the
Day was well enough known to them long before the &s;ealing the
Charter, and might very well have been complied with&endq; (the Rea&s;ons
why the &s;ealing the Charter was &s;o long deferred are &s;et down before),
<PB N="262" REF="267">
&startq;and could be no Rea&s;on to them to neglect the giving Direction in their
own Concernments; but that They knew likewi&s;e, that the Day was en|larged
to a Day de&s;ired by them&s;elves, that there might be no Pretence
for Di&s;content:&endq; And thereupon the Order of the Court to that Purpo&s;e
was read to his Maje&s;ty, and They could not deny it to be true.</P>
<P>IN Conclu&s;ion, &s;ince it did appear that their Stock did in Truth &s;till re|main
in the <HI>Canaries,</HI> and in Ju&s;tice belonged to them, whether it was
their Fault or their Misfortune that it had not been drawn over in Time;
the King per&s;uaded the Governour and his A&s;&s;i&s;tants to give them &s;uch
Satisfaction in that and other Particulars,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who &s;atisfies all Parties.</NOTE> that before They retired from<MILESTONE N="10">
his Maje&s;ty's Pre&s;ence They were unanimou&s;ly agreed upon all their Pre|tences:
And though &s;ome of the Lords, upon &s;ome In&s;inuations and Di&s;|cour&s;es
which They had heard, had believed the Company to have been in
the Wrong, They were now fully convinced of the contrary, and believed
the Charter to be founded upon great Rea&s;on of State, and that the Execu|tion
of it had been very ju&s;tifiable and with great Moderation. And it is to
be ob&s;erved, that the Parliament being then a&s;&s;embled at <HI>Oxford,</HI> there was
not the lea&s;t Complaint again&s;t that Charter or Corporation.</P>
<P>AND this was the whole Progre&s;s of that Affair, until it &s;erved &s;ome Mens
Turns to make it afterwards Matter of Reproach to the Chancellor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Vindication of the Chan|cellor in this Affair.</NOTE> in a<MILESTONE N="20">
Time when He had too great a Weight of the King's Di&s;plea&s;ure upon him
to defend him&s;elf from that and other Calumnies, which few Men thought
him guilty of. And if the Motives of State were not of Weight enough to
&s;upport the Patent, more ought not to be objected to him than to every
other Coun&s;ellor, there having never been a more unanimous Concurrence
at that Board in any Advice They have given: And the Delays He u&s;ed in
the pa&s;&s;ing the Charter after it came to his Hand, his giving &s;o long Time
for the making Objections again&s;t it, and his &s;o po&s;itively oppo&s;ing the
Company with Reference to their being Freemen of the City, are no Signs
that He had &s;uch a Mind to plea&s;e them, as a Man would have who had<MILESTONE N="30">
been corrupted by them, or who was to have a Share in the Profit of the
Patent, as was afterwards &s;ugge&s;ted, but never believed by any to whom He
was in any Degree known, who knew well that He frequently refu&s;ed to re|ceive
Money that He might very lawfully have done, and never took a
Penny which He was obliged to refu&s;e. He was indeed, as often as that
Affair came to be debated, very clear in his Judgment for the King's grant|ing
it, and always continued of the &s;ame Opinion: Nor did He ever deny,
that &s;ome Months after the Patent was &s;ealed the Governour made him a
Pre&s;ent in the Name of the Corporation, as it is pre&s;umed He did to many
other Officers through who&s;e Hands it pa&s;&s;ed, and which was never refu&s;ed<MILESTONE N="40">
by any of his Predece&s;&s;ors when it came from a Community upon the pa&s;&s;|ing
a Charter; which He never concealed from the King, who thought He
might well do it. In the la&s;t Place it is to be remembered, that after all
the Clamour again&s;t this Charter in Parliament, and upon the arguing again&s;t
the Legality of it by eminent Lawyers before the Hou&s;e of Peers, it was &s;o
well &s;upported by the King's Attorney General and other learned Lawyers,
that the Lords would not give Judgment again&s;t it: But the Governour and
the Corporation dur&s;t not di&s;pute it farther with the Hou&s;e of Commons,
but cho&s;e to &s;urrender their Charter into the King's Hands.</P>
<P>THE <HI>French</HI> had their Amba&s;&s;adour, <HI>Mon&s;ieur Comminge,</HI> remaining &s;till<MILESTONE N="50">
in <HI>England,</HI> who pretended to be ready to fini&s;h &s;till the Treaty of Com|merce,
but formalized &s;o much upon every Article, though Nothing was de|manded
but what had been granted to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> that it was concluded
<PB N="263" REF="268">
that He wanted Power, though Somewhat was imputed to the Capriciou&s;|ne&s;s
of his Nature, which made him hard to treat with, and not always
vacant at the Hours him&s;elf a&s;&s;igned,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> French <HI>&s;end Amba&s;&s;a|dours into</HI> England <HI>un|der Pretence of Mediation.</HI></NOTE> being hypochondriack and &s;eldom &s;leep|ing
without Opium. As &s;oon as the War was declared the King of <HI>France</HI>
&s;ent two other Amba&s;&s;adours, whereof, for the Countenance and Splendour
of it, the Duke of <HI>Vernueil</HI> was one, who being Uncle to Both the Kings
was received rather under that Relation than in the other Capacity, and
was lodged and treated by the King during the whole Time of his Stay.
With him came likewi&s;e <HI>Mon&s;ieur Courtine,</HI> a Ma&s;ter of Reque&s;ts, and much
<MILESTONE N="10">the quicke&s;t Man of the three, and upon who&s;e Parts and Addre&s;s mo&s;t of
the Bu&s;ine&s;s depended. The former Amba&s;&s;adour was joined in Commi&s;|&s;ion
with the other two: And their declared Bu&s;ine&s;s was to mediate a Peace
between the King and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> when there had been yet little Harm
done, only great Preparations made on Both Sides for the War; which They
did not &s;eem very &s;olicitous to interrupt, but contented them&s;elves with de|claring
at their fir&s;t Audience, &startq;that the King their Ma&s;ter out of Chri&s;|tianity,
and to prevent the Effu&s;ion of Chri&s;tian Blood, de&s;ired to mediate
a Peace, which the <HI>States</HI> of the <HI>United Provinces</HI> were very willing He
&s;hould do, and profe&s;&s;ed to have a very great De&s;ire of Peace; which
<MILESTONE N="20">made his <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Maje&s;ty hope that He &s;hould find the &s;ame good In|clinations
here, and if He might be informed what his Maje&s;ty did require
or what would be grateful to him, He did not doubt but that He &s;hould
per&s;uade the <HI>States</HI> to &s;ubmit to it.&endq;</P>
<P>AND with this general Di&s;cour&s;e, and without delivering any Memorial in
Writing, the Amba&s;&s;adours acquie&s;ced for many Months, as if their Bu&s;i|&s;ine&s;s
was only that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour, who remained &s;till in <HI>London,</HI>
might know and &s;end Word to his Ma&s;ters that They had begun their Me|diation.
Otherwi&s;e They &s;eemed in all their Di&s;cour&s;es to make &s;ome Kind
of Apology for being &s;ent, implying &startq;as if the extraordinary Importunity
<MILESTONE N="30">of the <HI>Dutch</HI> had prevailed with the King to undertake this Mediation,
and which He did the rather, upon their Promi&s;e that They would yield
to any Thing He &s;hould advi&s;e them; and He was very far from de&s;iring
that his Maje&s;ty might not receive ample Satisfaction in what&s;oever He re|quired:&endq;
So that the King did not imagine, whatever Information He had
received before, and whatever Jealou&s;y He had entertained, that this Emba&s;&s;y
would be concluded in the Denunciation of a War again&s;t him. Nor is it
probable that the Amba&s;&s;adours them&s;elves at that Time knew that They
were to perform that Office, though it was afterwards evident that the
Matter had been long before re&s;olved in <HI>France.</HI> They lived between the
<MILESTONE N="40">two Courts, for the Queen Mother was likewi&s;e at that Time at her Palace
of <HI>Somer&s;et-Hou&s;e,</HI> in much Jollity, and as vacant from any Affairs till
They might receive new Orders from Court, but &s;pending much Time with
the <HI>Dutch</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour, whom They per&s;uaded &startq;that They were very in|tent
upon and had much advanced the Treaty,&endq; as appeared by the Am|ba&s;&s;adour's
Letters to the <HI>Hague.</HI></P>
<P>THE Plague increa&s;ed &s;o fa&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Queen Mother leaves</HI> England.</NOTE> that the Queen Mother, who had all the
Winter complained of her Indi&s;po&s;ition of Health, and declared that She
would in the Summer go again into <HI>France,</HI> took that Occa&s;ion, albeit She
was recovered to a very good State; and about the End of <HI>July</HI> removed
<MILESTONE N="50">and embarked for <HI>France,</HI> and took &s;o many Things with her, that it was
thought by many that She did not intend ever to return into <HI>England.</HI>
Whatever her Intentions at that Time were, She never did &s;ee <HI>England</HI>
again, though She lived many Years after.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="269">
IT was in <HI>April</HI> that the Duke went to Sea:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke con|tinually &s;ends for Reinforce|ments.</NOTE> And from the Day of his
going thither with the Fleet Letters and Orders came from him to the Day
of the Battle for an Addition of more Ships, upon Intelligence of an Increa&s;e
of Strength added to the Enemy, though They yet lay &s;till in the Harbours,
whil&s;t the Duke was upon their Coa&s;ts. But Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> &s;till made new
Demands, and wrote to the Chancellor, &startq;that whil&s;t the King's Brother
was at Sea and ventured his own Per&s;on, Nobody who wi&s;hed him well
would, for &s;aving Money, hinder any Thing from being &s;ent that his
Highne&s;s thought nece&s;&s;ary for his Defence:&endq; And all Things were &s;ent,
though procured with wonderful Difficulty.<MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>THE Trea&s;urer had believed, when all the Provi&s;ions were delivered which
had been demanded, and all Computations &s;atisfied which had been made,
and the Fleet at Sea, that there would have been no more Expen&s;e till its
Return; whereas every Day added new Expen&s;e which had not been
thought of: And the requiring of more Ships was then believed, and more
afterwards, to proceed from the re&s;tle&s;s Spirit of Mr. <HI>Coventry,</HI> who cared
not how much He increa&s;ed the Expen&s;e, and was willing to put the Trea|&s;urer
and all the King's Mini&s;ters to contend with all Difficulties, that
He might reproach their Lazine&s;s or Want of Ability. But They did
not gratify him in that, but all the Ships and whatever el&s;e was &s;ent for were<MILESTONE N="20">
&s;ent; in&s;omuch as the Fleet amounted to no le&s;s than one hundred Sail, and
was now retired for Want of Somewhat to do to our own Coa&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He retires to the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Coa&s;t.</HI></NOTE> where They
re&s;olved to attend the Motion of the Enemy: And in this Time mo&s;t of the
Volunteers, having endured the Unplea&s;antne&s;s of the Sea above a Month,
begun to think that the War was not &s;o nece&s;&s;ary as They had thought
it to be.</P>
<P>THE Duke's Family that was numerous in his own Ship were not at
Ea&s;e, and found le&s;s Re&s;pect from the Seamen than They had looked for:
They grew into Factions between them&s;elves, and the Earl of <HI>Falmouth</HI> and
Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> were Rivals who &s;hould have mo&s;t Intere&s;t in the Duke, who<MILESTONE N="30">
loved the Earl be&s;t but thought the other the wi&s;er Man, who &s;upported
<HI>Pen</HI> (who di&s;obliged all the Courtiers) even again&s;t the Earl, who contemned
<HI>Pen</HI> as a Fellow of no Sen&s;e, and not worthy of the Charge and Tru&s;t that
was repo&s;ed in him. In this Di&s;compo&s;ure and having Nothing to do,
every Body grew angry at the Occa&s;ion that brought them thither, and
wi&s;hed for Peace.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Falmouth,</HI> as in a Time of Lei&s;ure, was &s;ent by the Duke
with Compliments to the King, and to give him an Account of the good
State of the Fleet: He vi&s;ited the Chancellor, to whom He had always
paid great Re&s;pect and made many Profe&s;&s;ions; and He told him, &startq;that<MILESTONE N="40">
They were all mad who had wi&s;hed this War, and that him&s;elf had been
made a Fool to contribute to it, but that his Eyes were open, and a
Month's Experience at Sea had enough informed him of the great Hazards
the King ran in it.&endq; He reproached <HI>Pen</HI> &startq;as a Sot, and a Fellow that
He thought would be found without Courage.&endq; He told him, &startq;that the
King and the Duke too were Both inclined to Peace, and di&s;cerned that
the Charge and Expen&s;e of the War would be in&s;upportable;&endq; and con|cluded,
&startq;that as &s;oon as this Action &s;hould be over, which could not be
avoided many Days if the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet put to Sea, as it could not be
doubted it would, it would be good Time to make a Peace, which He<MILESTONE N="50">
de&s;ired him to think of, and to &s;peak with the King, whom He would
find di&s;po&s;ed to it:&endq; And &s;o He returned to the Fleet.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="270">
AND by that Time the <HI>Dutch</HI> were come out,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Dutch <HI>Fleet puts out to Sea under</HI> Opdam.</NOTE> and the next Day were in
View. They were near of equal Number, and well manned, under the
Command of <HI>Opdam</HI> the Admiral of the whole Fleet, upon whom the
<HI>States</HI> had conferred that Charge, that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> his Party might
conclude, that They never intended that He &s;hould have the Charges of his
Father and Grandfather, and likewi&s;e to gratify the Nobility of <HI>Holland,</HI>
that had a very &s;mall Share in the Government. And this Gentleman, who
had never been at Sea before, and had but a &s;mall Fortune, was of that
Number, and had joined with that Faction which was aver&s;e from the Family
<MILESTONE N="10">of <HI>Orange.</HI> The Fleets came within Sight of each other on the fir&s;t of
<HI>June,</HI> and had &s;ome Skirmi&s;hes which continued on the &s;econd, the Wind
favouring neither Party, as willing to keep them a&s;under: But upon the
third it &s;erved Both their Turns, and brought them as near each other as
They could de&s;ire to be.</P>
<P>NOR did the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;eem to advance with le&s;s Courage and Re&s;olution.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fir&s;t gene|ral Engage|ment.</NOTE>
<HI>Opdam</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> Admiral with his Squadron bore directly upon the Duke

very little before, whether by an Accident within his own Ship, or from a
Grenado or other Shot out of the Duke's Ship, his Gun-Room took Fire,
<MILESTONE N="20">and in a Moment the Ship &s;unk without any Man being &s;aved. The Vice-Admiral

and had boarded the Duke if Captain <HI>Jeremy Smith,</HI> a Captain of the
Duke's Squadron, had not put him&s;elf between and boarded the Vice-Ad|miral,
who was equally attacked by the Duke: And &s;o that Ship was taken
after mo&s;t of the Men were killed; and the Captain him&s;elf was &s;o wounded,
that He only lived to be brought on Board the Duke's Ship, and to com|plain
of his Companions &startq;for not having &s;econded him according to an
Oath They had taken on Board their Admiral the Day before,&endq; and died
within Half an Hour to the great Trouble of the Duke, who gave him
<MILESTONE N="30">a great Te&s;timony for a very gallant Man, and much de&s;ired to pre|&s;erve
him.</P>
<P>THE Fight continued all the Day with very great Lo&s;s of Men on all
Sides,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Dutch</HI> are $word$.</NOTE> though after the fir&s;t two Hours the <HI>Dutch,</HI> &s;eeing many of their
be&s;t Ships burned and more taken, did all that the Wind would give them
Leave to &s;eparate them&s;elves from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet, which pur&s;ued them &s;o
clo&s;e, that They found They lo&s;t more by flying than by fighting, and did
le&s;&s;en their Sails to give &s;ome Stop to the Pur&s;uit till the Night might favour
them: And the Evening no &s;ooner came, but They hoi&s;ed up all their Sails,
and intended Nothing but their E&s;cape.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40">WHEN there was no more to be done by the Approach of the Night, the
Duke, who was infinitely tired with the Labour of the Day, having lo&s;t

<HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet that He might lo&s;e no Ground, but find him&s;elf as near,
when the Day &s;hould appear, as He was then when He went to Sleep.&endq;
The Fleet had no Guide but the Lanthorn of the Admiral, and were not to
<MILESTONE N="50">out&s;ail him of Cour&s;e, and behaved them&s;elves accordingly. But when the
Duke aro&s;e and the Day appeared,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Remain|der of their Fleet e&s;capes by Night.</NOTE> the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet was out of View; and
before He could reach them, They were got into their Ports or under the
Shelter of their Flats, that it was not coun&s;ellable for the great Ships to pur|&s;ue
<PB N="266" REF="271">
them farther: Yet &s;ome of tho&s;e Ships which made not &s;o much Way,
or had not &s;teered &s;o directly, were taken by the le&s;&s;er Ships that followed
them. And the Duke had received &s;o many Blows on his own and the
other Ships, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to retire into Port, where they might be
repaired.</P>
<P>IT was a Day of &s;ignal Triumph,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The great Lo&s;s of the</HI> Dutch.</NOTE> the Action of it having much &s;urpa&s;&s;ed
all that was done in <HI>Cromwell's</HI> Time, who&s;e Navals were much greater than
had ever been in any Age: But the <HI>Dutch</HI> had never then fought with &s;o
much Courage and Re&s;olution; nor were their Ships then in Strength to be
compared to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as <HI>Van Trump</HI> a&s;&s;ured them, &startq;and that except<MILESTONE N="10">
They built better Ships They would be as often beaten as They fought
with the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI>&endq; And from that Time They new-built all their Navy,
and brought now with them as good Ships as any the King had: And the
Men for &s;ome Hours behaved them&s;elves well. In that Day the Duke &s;unk,
burned, and took eighteen good Ships of War, whereof Half were of the
be&s;t They had, with the Lo&s;s of one &s;ingle &s;mall Ship, for there was no
more mi&s;&s;ing of his whole Fleet. It is true the Number of the killed and
wounded Men was very great, and was thought the greater, becau&s;e in the
great Ma&s;&s;acre that was on the other Side there was no Man, except <HI>Opdam</HI>
their Admiral, who had a Name. There were many excellent Officers<MILESTONE N="20">
killed and taken, Men of Courage and of great Experience in naval Affairs,
and therefore an irreparable Damage to them; but They had grown up
from common Seamen, and &s;o were of no other Quality than every Mari|ner
of the Fleet.</P>
<P>ON the Part of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Per&s;ons &s;lain on the Side of the</HI> Engli&s;h. <HI>The Earl of</HI> Falmouth. <HI>Lord</HI> Mus|kerry.</NOTE> be&s;ides above two hundred Men that were
killed on Board the Duke's own Ship, there fell the Earl of <HI>Falmouth,</HI>
who hath been lately &s;poken of, and the Lord <HI>Muskerry,</HI> elde&s;t Son to
the Earl of <HI>Clancarty,</HI> a young Man of extraordinary Courage and Expecta|tion,
who had been Colonel of a Regiment of Foot in <HI>Flanders</HI> under the
Duke, and had the general E&s;timation of an excellent Officer: He was<MILESTONE N="30">
of the Duke's Bedchamber, and the Earl and He were at that Time &s;o near
the Duke, that his Highne&s;s was all covered with their Blood. There fell
likewi&s;e in the &s;ame Ship Mr. <HI>Richard Boyle,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Richard Boyle.</NOTE> a younger Son of the Earl of

where He had &s;pent his Time with &s;ingular Advantage, and took the fir&s;t
Opportunity to lo&s;e his Life in the King's Service. There were many other
Gentlemen Volunteers in the &s;ame Ship, who had the &s;ame Fate.</P>
<P>IN Prince <HI>Rupert's</HI> Ship, who did Wonders that Day, and in that of the
Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> who behaved him with notable Courage and Conduct,
there were very many Men &s;lain, and &s;ome Gentlemen Volunteers of the<MILESTONE N="40">
be&s;t Families who&s;e Memories &s;hould be pre&s;erved. The Earl of <HI>Marlbo|rough,</HI>

at Sea, having made many long Voyages at Sea, and being now
newly returned from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> whither the King had &s;ent him with
a Squadron of Ships to receive the I&s;land of <HI>Bombayne</HI> from <HI>Portugal,</HI> was
in this Battle likewi&s;e &s;lain. He was a Man of wonderful Parts in all Kinds
of Learning, which He took more Delight in than his Title; and having no
great E&s;tate de&s;cended to him, He brought down his Mind to his Fortune,
and lived very retired, but with more Reputation than any Fortune could
have given him.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Portland.</NOTE> The Earl of <HI>Portland</HI> was a Volunteer on Board his Ship,<MILESTONE N="50">
and lo&s;t his Life by his Side, being a young Man of very good Parts, newly

of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> his Son, though of a melancholick Nature, intended to
lead an active Life, and to apply him&s;elf to it under the Conduct of his
Father's Friend, with whom He died very bravely.</P>
<P>THERE was another almo&s;t irreparable Lo&s;s this Day in Sir <HI>John Law&s;on,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And Sir</HI> John Law&s;on.</NOTE>
who was Admiral of a Squadron, and of &s;o eminent Skill and Conduct in
all maritime Occa&s;ions, that his Coun&s;el was mo&s;t con&s;idered in all Debates,
and the greate&s;t Seamen were ready to receive Advice from him. In the
Middle of the Battle He received a Shot with a Mu&s;ket-Bullet upon the
Knee, with which He fell: And finding that He could no more &s;tand
<MILESTONE N="10">and was in great Torment, He &s;ent to the Duke to de&s;ire him to &s;end ano|ther
Man to command his Ship; which He pre&s;ently did. The Wound was
not conceived to be mortal; and They made Ha&s;te to &s;end him on Shore,
as far as <HI>Deptford</HI> or <HI>Greenwich,</HI> where for &s;ome Days there was Hope of
his Recovery; but &s;hortly his Wound gangrened, and &s;o He died with
very great Courage, and Profe&s;&s;ion of an entire Duty and Fidelity to
the King.</P>
<P>HE was indeed of all the Men of that Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Character.</NOTE> and of that Extraction and
Education, incomparably the mode&s;te&s;t and the wi&s;e&s;t Man, and mo&s;t worthy
to be confided in. He was of <HI>York&s;hire</HI> near <HI>Scarborough,</HI> of that Rank of
<MILESTONE N="20">People who are bred to the Sea from their Cradle. And a young Man of
that Profe&s;&s;ion He was, when the Parliament fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of
the Royal Navy; and <HI>Hull</HI> being in their Hands, all the Northern Seamen
ea&s;ily betook them&s;elves to their Service: And his Indu&s;try and Sobriety
made him quickly taken Notice of, and to be preferred from one Degree to
another, till from a common Sailor He was promoted to be a Captain of a
&s;mall Ve&s;&s;el, and from thence to the Command of the be&s;t Ships.</P>
<P>HE had been in all the Actions performed by <HI>Blake,</HI> &s;ome of which were
very &s;tupendous, and in all the Battles which <HI>Cromwell</HI> had fought with the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> in which He was a &s;ignal Officer and very much valued by him.
<MILESTONE N="30">He was of that <HI>Cla&s;&s;is</HI> of Religion which were called <HI>Independents,</HI> mo&s;t of
which were <HI>Anabapti&s;ts,</HI> who were generally believed to have mo&s;t Aver&s;ion
to the King, and therefore employed in mo&s;t Offices of Tru&s;t. He was
Commander in Chief of the Fleet when <HI>Richard</HI> was thrown out: And
when the Conte&s;t grew between the <HI>Rump</HI> and <HI>Lambert,</HI> He brought the
whole Fleet into the River, and declared for that which was called the Par|liament;
which brake the Neck of all other De&s;igns, though He intended
only the better Settlement of the <HI>Commonwealth.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Council of State</HI> was &s;ettled between the Di&s;&s;olution of the
<HI>Rump</HI> and the calling the Parliament, They did not like the Temper of the
<MILESTONE N="40">Fleet, nor e&s;pecially of <HI>Law&s;on,</HI> who under the Title of Vice-Admiral had
the whole Command of the Fleet, which was very &s;trong, and in which
there were many Captains They liked well: Yet They dur&s;t not remove
the Vice-Admiral, left his Intere&s;t in the Seamen, which was very great,
&s;hould give them new Trouble. The Expedient They re&s;olved upon was
to &s;end Colonel <HI>Mountague</HI> as Admiral to command the Fleet, without re|moving
<HI>Law&s;on,</HI> who continued &s;till in his Command, and could not refu&s;e
to be commanded by <HI>Mountague,</HI> who had always been his &s;uperiour Of|ficer,
and who had likewi&s;e a great Intere&s;t in very many of the Officers
and Seamen. Yet <HI>Mountague,</HI> who brought with him a firm Re&s;olution to
<MILESTONE N="50">&s;erve the King, which was well known to his Maje&s;ty, had no Confidence
in <HI>Law&s;on</HI> till the Parliament had proclaimed the King: And when He
brought the Fleet to <HI>Scheveling</HI> to receive the King, all Men looked upon
the Vice-Admiral as a great <HI>Anabapti&s;t</HI> and not fit to be tru&s;ted. But when
<PB N="268" REF="273">
the King and the Duke had conferred with him, They liked him very well:
And He was from Time to Time in the Command of Vice-Admiral in all
the Fleets which were &s;ent into the <HI>Mediterranean.</HI> Nor did any Man per|form
his Duty better: He cau&s;ed all Per&s;ons, how well qualified &s;oever, who
He knew were affected to a Republick, to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the Service,
and brought very good Order into his own Ship, and frequented the Church-Prayers
him&s;elf, and made all the Seamen do &s;o. He was very remarkable
in his Affection and Countenance towards all tho&s;e who had faithfully &s;erved
the King, and never commended any Body to the Duke to be preferred but
&s;uch; and performed to his Death all that could be expected from a brave<MILESTONE N="10">
and an hone&s;t Man.</P>
<P>IT looked like &s;ome Pre&s;age that He had of his own Death, that be|fore
He went to Sea He came to the Trea&s;urer and the Chancellor, to
whom He had always borne much Re&s;pect, and &s;pake to them in a Dia|lect
He had never before u&s;ed, for He was a very generous Man, and
lived in his Hou&s;e decently and plentifully, and had never made any the
lea&s;t Suit or Pretence for Money. Now He told them, &startq;that He was going
upon an Expedition in which many hone&s;t Men mu&s;t lo&s;e their Lives:
And though He had no Apprehen&s;ion of him&s;elf, but that God would
protect him as He had often done in the &s;ame Occa&s;ions, yet He<MILESTONE N="20">
thought it became him again&s;t the Wor&s;t to make his Condition known
to them, and the rather, becau&s;e He knew He was e&s;teemed generally to
be rich.&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;in Truth He thought him&s;elf &s;o &s;ome few Months
&s;ince, when He was worth eight or nine thou&s;and Pounds: But the Marriage
of his Daughter to a young Gentleman in Quality and Fortune much
above him (Mr. <HI>Richard Norton</HI> of <HI>Southwick</HI> in <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> who had
fallen in Love with her, and his Father out of Tenderne&s;s to his Son had
con&s;ented to it) had obliged him to give her &s;uch a Portion as might
in &s;ome Degree make her worthy of &s;o great a Fortune; and that He
had not re&s;erved &s;o much to him&s;elf and Wife, and all his other Chil|dren<MILESTONE N="30">
which were four or five, as He had given to that Daughter.&endq; He
de&s;ired them therefore, &startq;that if He &s;hould mi&s;carry in this Enterpri&s;e, the
King would give his Wife two hundred Pounds a Year for her Life; if
He lived He de&s;ired Nothing, He hoped He &s;hould make &s;ome Provi&s;ion
for them by his own Indu&s;try: Nor did He de&s;ire any other Grant or Se|curity
for this two hundred Pounds yearly, than the King's Word and
Promi&s;e, and that They would &s;ee it effectual.&endq; The Suit was &s;o mo|de&s;t,
and the Ground of making it &s;o ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, that They wil|lingly
informed his Maje&s;ty of it, who as graciou&s;ly granted it, and &s;pake
him&s;elf to him of it with very obliging Circum&s;tances; &s;o that the poor<MILESTONE N="40">
Man went very contentedly to his Work, and peri&s;hed as gallantly in it
with an univer&s;al Lamentation. And it is to be pre&s;umed that the Promi&s;e
was as well peformed to his Wife: Sure it is, it was exactly complied with
whil&s;t either of tho&s;e two Per&s;ons had any Power.</P>
<P>THE Victory and Triumph of that Day was &s;urely very great, and a ju&s;t
Argument of publick Joy: How it came to be no greater &s;hall be &s;aid anon.
And the Trouble and Grief in many noble Families, for the Lo&s;s of &s;o many
worthy and gallant Per&s;ons, could not but be very lamentable in Wives,
in Fathers and Mothers,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King greatly trou|bled at the Death of the Earl of</HI> Fal|mouth.</NOTE> and the other neare&s;t Relations: But no Sorrow was
equal, at lea&s;t none &s;o remarkable, as the King's was for the Earl of <HI>Falmouth.</HI><MILESTONE N="50">
They who knew his Maje&s;ty be&s;t, and had &s;een how un&s;haken He had
&s;tood in other very terrible A&s;&s;aults, were amazed at the Flood of Tears He
&s;hed upon this Occa&s;ion. The Immen&s;ene&s;s of the Victory, and the Con|&s;equences
<PB N="269" REF="274">
that might have attended it; the Safety and Pre&s;ervation of his Bro|ther
with &s;o much Glory, on who&s;e Behalf He had had &s;o terrible Apprehen|&s;ions
during the three Days Fight, having by the Benefit of the Wind heard the
Thunder of the Ordnance from the Beginning, even after by the le&s;&s;ening of
the Noi&s;e as from a greater Di&s;tance He concluded that the Enemy was
upon Flight: Yet all this, and the univer&s;al Joy that He &s;aw in the Coun|tenance
of all Men for the Victory and the Safety of the Duke, made no
Impre&s;&s;ion in him towards the Mitigation of his Pa&s;&s;ion for the Lo&s;s of this
young Favourite, in whom few other Men had ever ob&s;erved any Virtue or
<MILESTONE N="10">Quality which They did not wi&s;h their be&s;t Friends without; and very
many did believe that his Death was a great Ingredient and con&s;iderable
Part of the Victory. He was young and of in&s;atiable Ambition; and a lit|tle
more Experience might have taught him all Things which his weak Parts
were capable of. But They who ob&s;erved the &s;trange Degree of Favour He
had on the &s;udden arrived to, even from a Dete&s;tation the King had towards
him, and concluded from thence, and more from the deep Sorrow the King
was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with for his Death, to what a prodigious Height He might
have reached in a little Time more, were not at all troubled that He was
taken out of the Way.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20">THE Duke, after He had given Directions for the &s;peedy repairing of the
Fleet, and for the pre&s;ent &s;ending out &s;uch Ships as could quickly be made
ready to ride before the Coa&s;t of <HI>Holland,</HI> made Ha&s;te to pre&s;ent him&s;elf to
the King, and to the Queen his Mother, who was ready to begin her Journey
to <HI>France,</HI> and had &s;tayed &s;ome Days to &s;ee the Succe&s;s of the naval Fight,
and afterwards to &s;ee the Duke; and within few Days after his Arrival her
Maje&s;ty left the Kingdom.</P>
<P>AND now the Whi&s;per began in the Duke's Family of the Rea&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rea&s;on why the Vic|tory was no farther im|proved.</NOTE> why
the Victory after &s;o great Advantages had not been pur&s;ued with that Vigour
that might have made it more de&s;tructive to the Enemy than it proved to be.
<MILESTONE N="30">The Ma&s;ter of the Duke's Ship (Captain&mdash;) pur&s;ued his Orders very
punctually after the Duke was gone to Sleep, and kept within a ju&s;t Di|&s;tance
of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet that remained in Order together, for many fled in
Confu&s;ion and &s;ingly to that Part of the Coa&s;t that They thought They knew
be&s;t; and many of them were taken. But the Duke was no &s;ooner in Sleep,
but Mr. <HI>Brounker</HI> of his Bedchamber, who with wonderful Confu&s;ion had
&s;u&s;tained the Terrour of the Day, re&s;olved to prevent the like on the Day
&s;ucceeding. He fir&s;t went to Sir <HI>William Pen,</HI> who commanded the Ship,
and told him, &startq;that He knew well how miraculou&s;ly the Duke was pre|&s;erved
that Day, and that They ought not farther to tempt God;&endq; wi&s;hed
<MILESTONE N="40">him to remember, &startq;that the Duke was not only the King's Brother but the
Heir Apparent of the Crown, and what the Con&s;equence would be if He
&s;hould be lo&s;t. And therefore it would concern him not to &s;uffer the
Duke's known and notorious Courage to engage him in a new Dan|ger,
which He would infallibly be expo&s;ed to the next Morning, if They
continued to make &s;o much Sail as They did, and to keep &s;o near the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> who fled, but if They were pre&s;&s;ed and in De&s;pair would fight as
&s;toutly as They had done in the Beginning. And therefore He de&s;ired and
advi&s;ed him to give the Ma&s;ter Order to &s;lacken the Sails, that the <HI>Dutch</HI>
might get what Ground They could, to avoid a farther Encounter.&endq; <HI>Pen</HI>
<MILESTONE N="50">an&s;wered him hone&s;tly, and told him, &startq;He dur&s;t give no &s;uch Orders ex|cept
He had a Mind to be hanged, for the Duke had him&s;elf given po&s;i|tive
Charge to the contrary.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="275">
MR. <HI>Brounker,</HI> when He could not prevail there, confidently went to
the Ma&s;ter of the Ship, who was an hone&s;t and a &s;tout Man, and carefully
kept the Steerage him&s;elf that He might be &s;ure to ob&s;erve the Order He
had received from his Highne&s;s, and told him, &startq;that it was the Duke's
Plea&s;ure that He &s;hould &s;lack the Sails without taking Notice of it to
any Man.&endq; Whereupon the Ma&s;ter did as He was commanded, making
no Doubt that a Servant &s;o near the Per&s;on of his Highne&s;s, and in &s;o
much Favour with him, would not have brought &s;uch an Order without
due Authority.</P>
<P>AND by this Means the Remainder of the Fleet e&s;caped, which otherwi&s;e<MILESTONE N="10">
would probably have been all taken: For it was afterwards known, that there
was &s;uch a Confu&s;ion among&s;t the Officers, that Nobody would obey; for
though in Truth the Right of commanding, according to the Cour&s;e ob|&s;erved
among&s;t them, after the Death of <HI>Opdam</HI> was in the Vice-Admiral
of <HI>Zealand,</HI> yet, He being likewi&s;e killed, the other could not agree. But
young <HI>Trump</HI> the Son of the old famous Admiral, who had behaved him|&s;elf
very bravely all the Day, challenged the Command in the Right of <HI>Hol|land;</HI>
but <HI>John Evert&s;on</HI> of <HI>Zealand,</HI> Brother to him that was killed, re|quired
it as his Right: Which begat &s;o great an Animo&s;ity as well as Con|fu&s;ion
among&s;t them, that the Morning, if They had been pur&s;ued,<MILESTONE N="20">
would in all Probability have proved as di&s;mal to them as the Day before
had done.</P>
<P>BUT the Duke never &s;u&s;pected this, nor did any pre&s;ume to tell him of
it, which made many Men pre&s;ume that it was done with Privity of Mr.
<HI>Coventry,</HI> not only for the great Friend&s;hip between him and <HI>Brounker,</HI> but
becau&s;e both <HI>Pen</HI> and the Ma&s;ter were &s;o &s;ilent when the Duke was &s;o
much troubled the next Morning: Nor did the Duke come to hear of it
till &s;ome Years after, when Mr. <HI>Brounker's</HI> ill Cour&s;e of Life and his abo|minable
Nature had rendered him &s;o odious, that it was taken Notice of in
Parliament, and upon Examination found to be true, as is here related;<MILESTONE N="30">
upon which He was expelled the Hou&s;e of Commons, whereof He was a
Member, as an infamous Per&s;on, though his Friend <HI>Coventry</HI> adhered to
him, and u&s;ed many indirect Arts to have protected him, and afterwards
procured him to have more Countenance from the King than mo&s;t Men
thought He de&s;erved, being a Per&s;on throughout his whole Life never no|torious
for any Thing but the highe&s;t Degree of Impudence, and &s;tooping
to the mo&s;t infamous Offices, and playing very well at Che&s;s, which pre|ferred
him more than the mo&s;t virtuous Qualities could have done.</P>
<P>WITH this Victory a new va&s;t Charge and Expen&s;e (be&s;ide the repairing
the hurt Ships, Ma&s;ts and Rigging, and fitting out new Ships of War, and<MILESTONE N="40">
buying more Fire&s;hips) appeared, that was never fore&s;een or brought into any
Computation; which was a Provi&s;ion for &s;ick and wounded Men, which
amounted to &s;o great a Number upon all the Coa&s;t, that the Charge
amounted in all Places, notwith&s;tanding the general Charity of the Peo|ple,
and the Convenience that many Ho&s;pitals yielded, to above two thou|&s;and
Pounds the Week for &s;ome Weeks, and though le&s;s afterwards by the
Death and Recovery of many, yet continued very great; be&s;ides the Charge
of keeping the <HI>Dutch</HI> Pri&s;oners, which were above two thou&s;and, and every
Day increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE Duke was very impatient to repair and &s;et out the Fleet again to<MILESTONE N="50">
Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen Mother pre|vents the Duke's going to Sea again.</NOTE> and re&s;olved Nothing more than to go in Per&s;on again to command it,
his Family remaining &s;till on Board, and preparing &s;uch Things as were
wanting for his Accommodation: But the Queen Mother had prevailed with
<PB N="271" REF="276">
the King at parting to promi&s;e her, &startq;that the Duke &s;hould not go again
in Per&s;on in that Expedition;&endq; which was concealed from the Duke, his
Maje&s;ty believing that the Confidence of his Royal Highne&s;s's going contri|buted
very much to the &s;etting out the Fleet, as it did &s;o much, that but
for that, it had been impo&s;&s;ible to have procured &s;o much Money as was
with infinite Difficulty procured, to &s;atisfy the Expen&s;es of &s;o many Kinds,
whereof many had been unthought of. And towards this there was a Be|nefit
that flowed from a Fountain of extreme Mi&s;ery, which was the In|crea&s;e
of the Plague, which &s;pread &s;o fa&s;t that the King's &s;taying &s;o long in
<MILESTONE N="10">Town was very dangerous. Yet the Approach of this great Calamity, that
in other Re&s;pects produced great Mi&s;chiefs, advanced the pre&s;ent Enterpri&s;e:
For all People who had Money knew not what to do with it, not daring to
leave it in their Hou&s;es where They dur&s;t not &s;tay them&s;elves; &s;o that They
willingly put it into the Bankers Hands, who &s;upplied the King upon &s;uch
A&s;&s;ignations as the late Act of Parliament and other Branches of the King's
Revenue would yet bear.</P>
<P>AND if at this Time the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;adours had pur&s;ued their Office of
Mediation,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> French <HI>Amba&s;&s;adours neglect an Op|portunity of making Peace.</HI></NOTE> it is very probable that it might have been with Succe&s;s. For
be&s;ides the great Lo&s;s the <HI>Dutch</HI> had received in the Battle and in their being
<MILESTONE N="20">deprived of &s;o many of the Merchants Ships, the Factions were irreconcilable
in the Fleet: There were many Officers who had behaved them&s;elves very
ba&s;ely and cowardly in the Action, but They knew not how to puni&s;h
them; <HI>Evert&s;on</HI> and <HI>Trump,</HI> who were their be&s;t Seamen, would not &s;ubmit
to be commanded by each other; the People were ready to ri&s;e upon <HI>De
Wit,</HI> upon whom They looked as the Occa&s;ion of the War, and cried
aloud for Peace. And the Faction among&s;t the <HI>States</HI> them&s;elves was very
vi&s;ible: All the other complained bitterly again&s;t the Province of <HI>Holland,</HI>
which&endq; They &s;aid &startq;had engaged them in a War again&s;t their Will and
without their Privity, which was directly contrary to the Form and Con|&s;titution
<MILESTONE N="30">of their Government.&endq; In a Word, Peace was univer&s;ally de|&s;ired
and prayed for; and in the Opinion of all Men, any rea&s;onable Con|ditions
would at that Time have been yielded to. And as the People of
<HI>England</HI> generally had not been plea&s;ed with the beginning the War, &s;o the
Court was weary of it; and the King would have been willing to have re|ceived
any good Overtures for the compo&s;ing it, and the Duke, &s;ince He
was kept from bearing a Part in it, would not have oppo&s;ed it. But the
Amba&s;&s;adours pre&s;&s;ed no &s;uch Matter, but congratulated the Victory with
the &s;ame Joy They found in the Court, and &s;eemed to think that any Mi&s;|fortune
that could befall the <HI>Dutch</HI> would be but a ju&s;t Puni&s;hment for
<MILESTONE N="40">their Pride and In&s;olence towards all their neighbour Princes: The two Na|tions
had not yet worried them&s;elves enough, entirely to &s;ubmit to the Arbi|tration
of <HI>France;</HI> which it re&s;olved They &s;hould do.</P>
<P>WITHIN le&s;s than a Month the Fleet was again prepared and ready for
the Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fleet a gain prepared.</NOTE> as &s;trong and in as good a Condition as it had been before the Bat|tle;
and the King and the Duke went thither, the Duke making no Doubt
of putting his Per&s;on on Board. And the King at that Time re&s;olved that
Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> &s;hould have the joint Command of
it: In order to which Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> was prepared, of who&s;e ea&s;y Concur|rence
only there was &s;ome Doubt, his Maje&s;ty promi&s;ing him&s;elf all Confor|mity
<MILESTONE N="50">and Re&s;ignation from the Earl of <HI>Sandwich;</HI> which He met with in
Both, for the Prince very cheerfully &s;ubmitted to his Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure. In
the Journey the King acquainted his Brother with his Re&s;olution, and the
Promi&s;e He had made to the Queen their Mother; with which the Duke
<PB N="272" REF="277">
was much troubled, and offered many Rea&s;ons to divert his Maje&s;ty from
laying his Command upon him: But when He found there was no Remedy,
He &s;ubmitted, and gave Orders for di&s;embarking his Family and Goods.</P>
<P>BUT when this was communicated to Mr. <HI>Coventry,</HI> who was to prepare
&s;uch Commi&s;&s;ions and Warrants as upon this Alteration of Coun&s;els were
nece&s;&s;ary, He per&s;uaded the Duke, and prevailed with him to believe,
&startq;that it would be much better to commit the &s;ole Command of the Fleet
to the Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> than to join Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> in it with him,&endq; who,
for no other Rea&s;on but for not e&s;teeming him at the Rate He valued him|&s;elf,
had been long in his Disfavour. He &s;ugge&s;ted &s;ome Defects in the<MILESTONE N="10">
Prince, which Nobody could ab&s;olve him from, and which the gentle
Temper of the Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> who knew him as well as the other,
could have complied with: And many thought it would have in the Con|junction
produced a very good Mixture, the Danger from the Prince being
too &s;udden Re&s;olutions from too much Heat and Pa&s;&s;ion, and the Earl
having enough of Phlegm and Warine&s;s in deliberating, and much Vigour in
the executing what was concluded; and They were Both well prepared and
inclined to perform the Function.</P>
<P>BUT Mr. <HI>Coventry's</HI> Advice prevailed both with the Duke and King:
And &s;o in the In&s;tant that the King and Duke were to return from the<MILESTONE N="20">
Fleet that was ready to &s;et Sail with the fir&s;t Wind, and not till then,
the King told Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> without enlarging upon the Rea&s;ons, &startq;that
He would have him to return with him to <HI>London</HI> and accompany him
this Summer, and that the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> &s;hould have the &s;ole Com|mand
of the Fleet;&endq; with which the Prince was wonderfully &s;urpri&s;ed
and perplexed and even heart-broken, but there was no contending. He
&s;tayed behind the King only till He could get his Goods and Family di&s;em|barked,
and then returned with very much Trouble to the Court: And the
Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> &s;et Sail with the Fleet,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Fleet puts out to Sea un|der the Earl of</HI> Sandwich.</NOTE> with Direction fir&s;t to vi&s;it the
Coa&s;t of <HI>Holland,</HI> and if He found that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet was not ready to<MILESTONE N="30">
come out, that He &s;hould go to the Northward to watch the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI>
Fleet, which had Orders from their Superiours to come by the <HI>North,</HI> that
They might avoid the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet, that was Ma&s;ter of the Sea.</P>
<P>IT was in the End of <HI>June</HI> or Beginning of <HI>July</HI> that the King and Duke
returned from the Fleet; and within few Days after, it &s;et Sail: When the
Plague increa&s;ed &s;o fa&s;t, that there died about two thou&s;and in a Week; &s;o
that all Men cried out again&s;t the King's &s;taying &s;o long at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> the
Sickne&s;s being already in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King moves to</HI> Hampton-Court <HI>on Ac|count of the Plague.</HI></NOTE> Whereupon the King, after He had
taken the be&s;t Care He could with the Lord Mayor for the good ordering
the City, and publi&s;hed &s;uch Orders as were thought nece&s;&s;ary for the Re|lief<MILESTONE N="40">
and Regulation of infected Per&s;ons, and prevailed with &s;ome Ju&s;tices of
the Peace in the <HI>Strand</HI> and in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> to promi&s;e to re&s;ide there
(which They were the more ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to do by the General's de|claring
that He would &s;tay in his Lodgings at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> which He did
during the whole Time of the Pe&s;tilence; and the Lord <HI>Craven</HI> out of
Friend&s;hip to him &s;tayed likewi&s;e in his Hou&s;e in <HI>Drury-Lane:</HI> And it
cannot be denied that the Pre&s;ence of tho&s;e two great Per&s;ons prevented
many Mi&s;chiefs which would have fallen out by the Di&s;order of the Peo|ple,
and was of great Convenience and Benefit to that End of the Town):
I &s;ay, when the King had &s;ettled all this He removed to <HI>Hampton,</HI> re|&s;olving<MILESTONE N="50">
there to con&s;ider how to di&s;po&s;e of him&s;elf for the Remainder of the
Summer. And becau&s;e there were many Particulars &s;till unre&s;olved con|cerning
the Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Ireland,</HI> his Maje&s;ty for &s;ome Days appointed that
<PB N="273" REF="278">
numerous People, that They might have no Pretence to come to <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI>
to attend at <HI>Sion;</HI> where for many Days together his Maje&s;ty &s;pent
many Hours, till He had compo&s;ed that Affair as well as it was for the pre|&s;ent
capable of.</P>
<P>THE Plague &s;till increa&s;ed at <HI>London,</HI> and &s;pread about the Country; &s;o
that it was not thought &s;afe for the Court to remain longer where it then
was, the Sickne&s;s being already in &s;ome of the adjacent Villages. Where|upon
the King re&s;olved that his own Family and his Brother's &s;hould re|move
to <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and &s;pend the Summer there. And becau&s;e it was
<MILESTONE N="10">already in View, that it would not be fit for the Parliament to a&s;&s;emble
again at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> in <HI>September,</HI> to which Time it was prorogued, nor
could it be computed at what Time it could be &s;afe to meet in that Place;
and it was as notorious that if the Parliament met not &s;omewhere, whereby
the King might have another Supply before the Winter, there would be very
great Confu&s;ion for Want of Money: He cau&s;ed therefore a Proclamation to
i&s;&s;ue out,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia|ment ad|journed to</HI> Ox|ford.</NOTE> &startq;that He intended to adjourn the Parliament to meet at <HI>Oxford</HI>
upon the tenth of <HI>October</HI> next, and that the Members need not to attend
at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> in <HI>September.</HI>&endq; And then He directed the Speaker of the
Hou&s;e of Commons, who lived within Half a Day of <HI>London,</HI> and the Ge|neral
<MILESTONE N="20">and the Lord <HI>Craven,</HI> to give Notice to the Members of Both Hou&s;es,
who lived within that Di&s;tance, to be pre&s;ent in Both Hou&s;es at the Day to
which They were prorogued, and then to adjourn to <HI>Oxford</HI> according to
the Proclamation. And this being &s;ettled, his Maje&s;ty appointed a Day
for beginning his Progre&s;s from <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> to <HI>Sali&s;bury;</HI> again&s;t which
Time all Carriages and what&s;oever was nece&s;&s;ary for the Journey were
prepared.</P>
<P>IN the Morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> W. Co|ventry <HI>per|&s;uades the Duke to &s;pend the Summer at</HI> York.</NOTE> when every Body believed that the King and Queen and
Duke and Dutche&s;s, with Both their Families, were to go together one Way,
Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> found a Way to break that Re&s;olution, having no Mind to
<MILESTONE N="30">be in &s;o great a Court that his Greatne&s;s would not appear. He told the
Duke, &startq;that there were general Di&s;contents throughout the Kingdom,&endq;
which was true, &startq;and a Probability of In&s;urrections,&endq; which were much
&s;poken of and apprehended; &startq;and therefore it might be better that the
King and the Duke might not be together, but in &s;everal Places, that
They might draw what Forces were nece&s;&s;ary to them, which the Pre|&s;ence
of their own Per&s;ons would ea&s;ily do: That the Fleet would pro|bably
be all the Summer upon the Northern Coa&s;t in Expectation of the
<HI>Dutch Ea&s;t-India</HI> Fleet;&endq; for it was not then thought that the <HI>Hol|landers</HI>
would have been able to have &s;et out another Fleet able to have
<MILESTONE N="40">encountered ours. Upon the whole Matter He propo&s;ed to him, &startq;that &s;ince
the King meant to &s;pend the Summer in the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> with which there
could very hardly be any Corre&s;pondence from the Fleet, his Highne&s;s
&s;hould go into the <HI>North</HI> and re&s;ide at <HI>York;</HI> by which He would have
an Influence upon all tho&s;e Parts where the mo&s;t di&s;affected Per&s;ons were
mo&s;t inhabitant, and from <HI>Hull</HI> and tho&s;e maritime Parts He could not
be long without receiving &s;ome Intelligence from the Fleet.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Truth is; the Con&s;titution of the Court at this Time was &s;uch, the
Prevalence of the Lady &s;o great, and the Queen's Humour thereupon &s;o in|con&s;tant,
and all together &s;o di&s;compo&s;ed the King, that there was no Plea|&s;ure
<MILESTONE N="50">in being a Part of it: And therefore the Advice was as &s;oon embraced,
as given, by the Duke and his Wife, who were well content to enjoy them|&s;elves
in their own Family apart. And the Duke pre&s;ently propo&s;ed it to
the King, and Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> di&s;cour&s;ed all the Motives to him &s;o fully
<PB N="274" REF="279">
that his Maje&s;ty approved it. And then, if it were to be done at all, the
fir&s;t attending the King to <HI>Salisbury,</HI> which was &s;o much out of the Way,
would be to no Purpo&s;e: And therefore it was re&s;olved (all the Coaches
and Carriages being then at the Doors to go to <HI>Farnham,</HI> which was the
fir&s;t Day's Journey towards <HI>Salisbury</HI>),<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King re|moves to</HI> Sali&s;|bury.</NOTE> that the King and his Brother would
part upon the Place, and that the King and Queen &s;hould continue their
Purpo&s;e for <HI>Farnham,</HI> and the Duke and his Wife &s;hould go that Night
to <HI>St. Albans,</HI> and &s;o pro&s;ecute his Journey for <HI>York;</HI> and all Orders were
in the In&s;tant given out to this Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>WHETHER the Rea&s;ons of this Coun&s;el were of Importance or not, the<MILESTONE N="10">
Alteration on &s;uch a &s;udden from what had been before determined was
thought very &s;trange, and wondered at, and made many believe that &s;ome
Accident was fallen out that mu&s;t not be di&s;covered: For on the &s;udden
it was, there having been no &s;uch Thought Overnight, when the Chan|cellor
left the Court to go to his own Hou&s;e at <HI>Twickenham.</HI> And when
He returned the next Morning, the Re&s;olution was taken, and every Body
well plea&s;ed with the Change, and both the King and the Duke told
him with Satisfaction of it; nor did He under&s;tand it enough to make
Objections again&s;t it, which would have been ingrateful; nor was it conve|nient
to &s;pend longer Time in Deliberation at that Place, where &s;ome of the<MILESTONE N="20">
inferiour Servants had died the Night before of the Plague: And &s;o They
all entered upon their Journey by Nine of the Clock the &s;ame Morning.</P>
<P>IT is nece&s;&s;ary in this Place to remember,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Bi&s;hop of</HI> Mun&s;ter <HI>en|gages to in|vade the</HI> U|nited Pro|vinces.</NOTE> that the Expre&s;s, that had been
&s;ent by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mun&s;ter's</HI> Agent with the Conditions which were of|fered
by the King, returned with great Expedition, and brought the Bi&s;hop's
Acceptation and Engagement, &startq;that, upon the Payment of the fir&s;t Sum
that was agreed upon, He would draw his Army together, and march
with an Army of twenty thou&s;and Hor&s;e and Foot into the <HI>States</HI> Domi|nions.&endq;
And the King before He left <HI>London</HI> had &s;igned the Treaty, and
made the fir&s;t Payment, and provided for the &s;econd: So that He now ex|pected<MILESTONE N="30">
that the Bi&s;hop &s;hould be &s;hortly upon his March, and fix his Win|ter-Quarters
in tho&s;e <HI>Provinces;</HI> which He did re&s;olve and intend with Cou|rage
and Sincerity, and which in that Conjuncture mu&s;t have put the
Coun&s;els of <HI>Holland</HI> into great Confu&s;ion, when they began to be again
reduced into &s;ome Order.</P>
<P>THE indefatigable Indu&s;try and Dexterity of the Pen&s;ionary <HI>De Wit</HI>
prevailed with the <HI>States</HI> to believe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Wit <HI>per|&s;uades the</HI> Dutch <HI>to pre|pare another Fleet.</HI></NOTE> &startq;that He thought a Peace to be ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for their Affairs, and de&s;ired Nothing but that it might be upon
honourable and &s;afe Conditions, and that <HI>France</HI> was very real in the en|deavouring
it: But that the Enemy was &s;o in&s;olent upon their late Suc|ce&s;s,<MILESTONE N="40">
that They neglected all Overtures, and believed that the Factions and
Divi&s;ions among&s;t them&s;elves would hinder them from being able to &s;et out
another Fleet; and therefore that ought to be the fir&s;t De&s;ign. And if
their Fleet were ready to go out, He doubted not but a Peace would
quickly follow: For that <HI>France</HI> was engaged, if the King &s;hould not
con&s;ent to what is ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, to declare a War again&s;t <HI>England,</HI>
and to a&s;&s;i&s;t them with Men and Money, and all his own naval Power,
which the Duke of <HI>Beaufort</HI> was then preparing and making ready in all
the Ports of <HI>France.</HI> But that it was not to be expected that They would
&s;end out their Fleet, which was much inferiour to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> except<MILESTONE N="50">
They fir&s;t &s;aw a <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet at Sea ready to join with them.&endq; He wi&s;hed
them to con&s;ider &startq;how much They were all concerned in their <HI>India</HI> Ships,
which were in their Voyage, and could not be far from their Coa&s;ts in a
<PB N="275" REF="280">
&s;hort Time; all which would inevitably fall into the Hands of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI>
if They had no Fleet at Sea to relieve them.&endq;</P>
<P>THESE Rea&s;ons, of Weight in them&s;elves, and the Concernment of mo&s;t
of them in the Pre&s;ervation of the <HI>Indian</HI> Ships, prevailed with them to
do all that could be done to &s;et out a new Fleet: And to that Purpo&s;e
They &s;ent very &s;trict and &s;evere Orders to their &s;everal Admiralties, for the
proceeding again&s;t all, without Di&s;tinction of Per&s;ons, who had mi&s;behaved
them&s;elves in the late Battle, and to provide new Ships and all nece&s;&s;ary
Provi&s;ions, to the End that their Fleet might be at Sea by a Time. And
<MILESTONE N="10">this grew the more ea&s;y to them, by the &s;ea&s;onable Return of <HI>De Ruyter</HI>
with his Fleet from <HI>Guinea,</HI> which brought a pre&s;ent Addition of good
Strength; and He had began the War upon the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and was the be&s;t
Sea-Officer They had, and had exerci&s;ed tho&s;e Commands that no other Of|ficer
could refu&s;e to obey him.</P>
<P>FOR the &s;peedy carrying on the&s;e pre&s;ent Preparations,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Dutch <HI>make a Re|formation in their Nae$$.</HI></NOTE> They made, ac|cording
to their u&s;ual Cu&s;tom in extraordinary Occurrences, Committees of
the <HI>States</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the Admiralties of <HI>Zealand, Am&s;terdam,</HI> and <HI>Rot|terdam;</HI>
and to that Purpo&s;e <HI>De Wit,</HI> and &s;uch other as He thought fitte&s;t
at this Time to join with him, were appointed. They went fir&s;t to the
<MILESTONE N="20">Fleet to reform the Di&s;orders there: And though They dur&s;t not proceed
with that Severity as had been fit, yet They ca&s;hiered many Captains and
other Officers, and put &s;ome other Marks of Di&s;grace upon others, and
cau&s;ed one or two to die.</P>
<P>BUT that which <HI>De Wit's</HI> Heart was mo&s;t &s;et upon was to take Revenge
upon <HI>Van Trump,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">De Wit's <HI>Ma|lice again&s;t</HI> Van Trump.</NOTE> and to remove him from ever having any Command at Sea:
For though He was an excellent Officer, and upon the Stock of his Father's
Credit of great E&s;timation with the Seamen, and inferiour to no Man but
<HI>De Ruyter,</HI> and had behaved him&s;elf in the Battle with &s;ignal Courage; yet
his Di&s;pute with <HI>Evert&s;on</HI> upon Command had brought much Prejudice to
<MILESTONE N="30">them. But that which was wor&s;t of all and incen&s;ed <HI>De Wit</HI> implacably
was, that He was of entire Devotion to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> as his Fa|ther
had always been and all his Children continued to be, and He knew
well had an e&s;pecial Part, how covertly &s;oever, in fomenting the Murmurs
of the People again&s;t him and the War: And He re&s;olved to take this Op|portunity
of the good Temper the <HI>States</HI> were in in their Concurrence for
the &s;etting out the Fleet, not only to provide for the better Government of
their Ships and marine Conduct, but to puni&s;h and prevent the Murmurs at
Land, by removing all tho&s;e out of any Power whom He &s;u&s;pected to have
&s;ecretly contributed to them. He did all He could to make <HI>Van Trump's</HI>
<MILESTONE N="40">Offence capital, as if the Right of Command had been &s;o clear in <HI>Evert|&s;on</HI>
that the other could not di&s;pute it: But <HI>Van Trump</HI> defended him&s;elf
&s;o well and had &s;o many Friends, that He was ab&s;olved from that Guilt.
Yet for &s;ome pa&s;&s;ionate and indi&s;creet Words, in which He did naturally
abound, He was deprived of his Command, with a Declaration &startq;that He
&s;hould no more be employed in the Service of the <HI>States;</HI>&endq; which whil&s;t
the Government was in tho&s;e Hands He cared not for, and had a good E&s;|tate
to &s;ub&s;i&s;t without it. And &s;o for the pre&s;ent all Differences were com|po&s;ed
&s;o far, as to have a general Concurrence in what&s;oever was nece&s;&s;ary,
and in order to the making ready and &s;etting out their Fleet to Sea.</P>

hearty Affection to the King, and an Inclination to join in any Thing that
might not be de&s;tructive to their own Affairs: Nor did They di&s;&s;emble the
Injuries They had received from the <HI>Hollander</HI> even to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Amba&s;|&s;adour
him&s;elf, who was at the &s;ame Time &s;ent thither to unite that Crown
to their Intere&s;t, to which Purpo&s;e He had made &s;everal &s;pecious Overtures.
Nor did They conceal the Jealou&s;y They had of the <HI>French,</HI> who had not
complied with the Payment of the yearly Sum of Money which They were<MILESTONE N="40">
obliged to make to them for the Support of their Army, of which They were
in a great Arrear, that di&s;compo&s;ed their Affairs very much. And though <HI>M.
Pompone,</HI> who had been long Re&s;ident in that Court as an Envoy, was now
come thither as Amba&s;&s;adour from <HI>France,</HI> and brought with him a good
Sum of Money to retain them fa&s;t to their Dependance upon them; yet the
Money was not Half that was due to them, and They well knew what
dark Ends it was for: And They did exceedingly fear the Omnipotence
of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>THERE were two Things, which kept them from a full Declaration on
the King's Behalf, and engaging pre&s;ently in his Intere&s;t. The fir&s;t was the<MILESTONE N="50">
Apprehen&s;ion that They had of <HI>Denmark,</HI> that it would take this Opportu|nity
to unite them&s;elves more firmly to the <HI>Hollander,</HI> and &s;o attempt to
deprive <HI>Sweden</HI> of all their late Conque&s;t, which was confirmed to them by
<PB N="277" REF="282">
their own Treaty of <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> which They were re&s;olved never to part
from: And in this Particular They were to expect &s;ome Satisfaction and
Security from the Negotiation of Sir <HI>Gilbert Talbot.</HI> The other was, that
They might &s;ee the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> fully engaged, upon who&s;e Expedi|tion
They had much Expectation. And Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> had informed them
of that whole Agreement, which would have given them Opportunity to
have pro&s;ecuted their own De&s;ign upon <HI>Bremen,</HI> to which their Hearts were
mo&s;t devoted.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Gilbert Talbot</HI> had been as well received in <HI>Denmark,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And of Sir</HI> Gilbert Tal|bot's <HI>to</HI> Den|mark.</NOTE> with all the
<MILESTONE N="10">Profe&s;&s;ions imaginable of Affection to the King, and of their Dete&s;tation of
the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who in Truth had exerci&s;ed a &s;trange Tyranny over them by
the Advantage of their Nece&s;&s;ities; nor is the Inju&s;tice, Oppre&s;&s;ion and In|dignities
which They had &s;u&s;tained from them to be expre&s;&s;ed and de&s;cribed,
without entering into a large Di&s;cour&s;e of Particulars which are foreign to
this Relation: Let it &s;uffice, that there needed few Arguments to per&s;uade
that King to any Thing that was within his Power, and which would have
done &s;ignal Mi&s;chief to the <HI>Dutch.</HI> But the Truth is, the Kingdom was
very poor, the People unwarlike, the King him&s;elf very good and very
weak, jealous of all the great Men, and not yet recovered of the Fright that
<MILESTONE N="20"><HI>Wolfelt</HI> had put him into. His chief Mini&s;ter, one <HI>Gabell,</HI> had gotten his
Credit by having been his Barber, an illiterate and unbred Man, yet his &s;ole
Confident in his Bu&s;ine&s;s of greate&s;t Tru&s;t; which made all the Per&s;ons of
Quality in the Kingdom, who are as proud of their Nobility as any Nation,
full of Indignation. And They were able to cro&s;s many Re&s;olutions after
they were taken, though They could not e&s;tabli&s;h others in the Place; which
made the King very irre&s;olute and unfixed: So that what was concluded To|Day
was rever&s;ed or not pur&s;ued To-morrow. They profe&s;&s;ed a great Jea|lou&s;y
of the <HI>Swede,</HI> as the greate&s;t Argument, but their Weakne&s;s, again&s;t a
War with the <HI>Dutch;</HI> yet were not willing to propo&s;e any Expedients which
<MILESTONE N="30">might &s;ecure them again&s;t tho&s;e Jealou&s;ies. And the King ab&s;olutely denied
that He had ever given <HI>Hannibal Ze&s;ted</HI> Authority to declare, &startq;that He would
again confirm the Treaty He had made&endq; and &s;eemed to take it unkindly
that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould think it rea&s;onable, who therefore thought it &s;o, be|cau&s;e
it was propo&s;ed by him&s;elf, and becau&s;e He &s;till confe&s;&s;ed, &startq;that He
could make no Attempt to recover what He had parted with.&endq; That
which He did unrea&s;onably de&s;ign, in all the Di&s;gui&s;es which were put on,
was to engage the King to endeavour to per&s;uade the <HI>Swede</HI> to give up and
re&s;tore <HI>El&s;enore</HI> and the other Places to <HI>Denmark,</HI> or to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with
Force for the Recovery of them when there &s;hould be a Peace concluded
<MILESTONE N="40">with <HI>Holland:</HI> So that the King de&s;paired of any Good from that Ne|gotiation,
and re&s;olved &s;hortly to recall his Mini&s;ter from thence.</P>
<P>BUT there was on a &s;udden a Change to Wonder.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A particular Account of the Attempt upon the</HI> Dutch <HI>at</HI> Bergen.</NOTE> <HI>Gabell</HI> came early in
a Morning to Sir <HI>Gilbert Talbot,</HI> and told him, &startq;his <HI>Ma&s;ter was now re|&s;olved</HI>
to unite his Intere&s;t entirely to that of the King of <HI>England,</HI> having
now an Opportunity to do it &s;ecurely to Both their Benefits.&endq; He told
him, &startq;that there were Letters arrived that Night from <HI>Bergen,</HI> with News
that the <HI>Dutch Ea&s;t-India</HI> Ships were all arrived in that Port with Orders
to remain there till they received new Orders from <HI>Holland,</HI> which they
&s;hould have as &s;oon as their Fleet &s;hould be ready to join with them.
<MILESTONE N="50">This had di&s;po&s;ed the King to re&s;olve to give the King of <HI>England</HI> Op|portunity
to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of all that Trea&s;ure, out of which He pre|&s;umed
He would allow him &s;uch a Share, as might enable him to declare,
and a&s;&s;i&s;t his Maje&s;ty vigorou&s;ly in his War again&s;t the <HI>Dutch.</HI> That if
<PB N="278" REF="283">
He gave &s;peedy Notice to the King's Fleet, which every Body knew was
then at Sea, it might ea&s;ily go to <HI>Bergen,</HI> where They might as ea&s;ily
&s;urpri&s;e all tho&s;e Ships in the Port, &s;ince They &s;hould receive no Oppo|&s;ition
from the Ca&s;tles under who&s;e Protection they lay.&endq;</P>
<P>AND when He had done his Relation, He offered him to go with him
to the King, that He might receive the Obligation from him&s;elf; which
Sir <HI>Gilbert Talbot</HI> pre&s;ently did, and found his Maje&s;ty as cheerful in the
Re&s;olution as <HI>Gabell</HI> had been. He repeated all that the other had &s;aid,
and more particularly &startq;that He thought it rea&s;onable that He might ex|pect
Half of the Value that the Whole would amount to; which He would<MILESTONE N="10">
rely upon the King's Honour and Ju&s;tice for, after the Ships &s;hould be in
<HI>England,</HI> that He might not be &s;u&s;pected by the <HI>Hollander,</HI> for He would
prote&s;t again&s;t the Act as a Violence that He could not re&s;i&s;t: And that He
would expect &s;o many of his Maje&s;ty's Ships to arrive in <HI>Denmark,</HI> and
to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, before He po&s;itively declared again&s;t the <HI>Dutch.</HI>&endq; He wi&s;hed
Sir <HI>Gilbert Talbot</HI> &startq;to &s;end an Expre&s;s forthwith to the King with all the&s;e
Particulars;&endq; which He did the next Day.</P>
<P>THIS Expre&s;s arrived within few Days after the King came to <HI>Sali&s;bury,</HI>
and was di&s;patched pre&s;ently back again with Letters to the King of <HI>Den|mark</HI>
of his Maje&s;ty's Con&s;ent and Ratification of all that He had propo&s;ed,<MILESTONE N="20">
and with Letters likewi&s;e to the Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> who according to his
former Orders had &s;ailed Northward in Hope to meet with that Fleet,
which was before got into <HI>Norway.</HI> The King's Letters to him came in a
very good Sea&s;on, and He immediately continued his Cour&s;e for <HI>Norway:</HI>
And when He came to that Length, and near enough to that Land of
Rocks which are terrible to all Seamen, He thought it be&s;t to remain at
Sea with his Fleet, le&s;t <HI>De Ruyter</HI> might by this Time be come out with
his Fleet (&s;ince his being come Northward could not be concealed, nor the
Arrival of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Fleet at <HI>Bergen;</HI> which would ha&s;ten the other),
and &s;ent in a Squadron of fifteen or &s;ixteen good Ships (of Strength &s;uffi|cient<MILESTONE N="30">
for the Bu&s;ine&s;s) into the Harbour of <HI>Bergen</HI> with a Letter to the Go|vernour.
And with it He &s;ent a Gentleman that was a Volunteer on Board
him, who hath been often mentioned before, Mr. <HI>Clifford,</HI> the Confident of
the Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> who was well in&s;tructed in all the Tran&s;actions which
had been at <HI>Copenhagen.</HI> Before They went into the Harbour, Mr. <HI>Clifford</HI>
and another Gentleman or two went by Boat to the Town, where He found
all the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships (about a Dozen in Number) riding very near the Shore,
and all under the Protection of the Ca&s;tle, into which They had put much
of their riche&s;t Lading from the Time of their fir&s;t coming thither, as to a
Place of unque&s;tionable Security.<MILESTONE N="40"></P>
<P>THE Governour was not &s;urpri&s;ed with the Me&s;&s;engers or the Letter, as
appeared by the Reception of Both, but &s;eemed troubled that They were
come &s;o &s;oon, before the Manner of performing the Action was enough
adju&s;ted: He could not deny but &startq;that He had received Orders from
<HI>Copenhagen;</HI> but that He expected more perfect Directions within
four and twenty Hours, and expected likewi&s;e the Pre&s;ence of the
Vice-King of <HI>Norway,</HI> who was his &s;uperiour Officer, and would in|fallibly
be there the next Day.&endq; The Behaviour of the Man was &s;uch
as made them believe it &s;incere, as in Truth it was, for He meant well,
and was content that the Ships, which though they were not come<MILESTONE N="50">
into the Port did not ride &s;afe among&s;t the Rocks, &s;hould come into the
Port, upon A&s;&s;urance that They would not attempt any ho&s;tile Act with|out
his Con&s;ent, which was till all Things &s;hould be agreed between
<PB N="279" REF="284">
them: And &s;o the Fleet entered; which the <HI>Dutch</HI> perceived with great
Con&s;ternation, yet changed the Po&s;ture of &s;ome of their Ships, and new-moored
the re&s;t, and put them&s;elves upon their Defence.</P>
<P>IT is a Port like no other that the World knows, a very great Number
of formidable Rocks, between each of which the Sea runs deep enough for
the greate&s;t Ships to ride &s;ecurely; &s;o that the Ships were as in &s;o many
Chambers apart between the Rocks: And the <HI>Dutch,</HI> which came thither
fir&s;t, had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of that Line of the Sea that lay next to the
Shore, to which They lay &s;o near that They could de&s;cend from their
<MILESTONE N="10">Ve&s;&s;els on Land; which had been much the better for the Enterpri&s;e, if
the <HI>Dane</HI> had concurred in it.</P>
<P>IT was &s;o late before the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships had taken their Places, which
was as near the <HI>Dutch</HI> as the Rocks would permit, that they remained
quiet all Night, which was &s;pent in Con&s;ultation between the Commander
in Chief of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships (who was a &s;tout and a good Officer but a
rough Man, who knew better how to follow his In&s;tructions than to de|bate
the Ground of them; but He was advi&s;ed by Mr. <HI>Clifford</HI> and con|formed
to his Judgment) and the Governour of the Town and Ca&s;tle,
who &s;eemed &s;till inclined not only to &s;uffer the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to do what They
<MILESTONE N="20">would, but to be willing to act a Part in it him&s;elf from the Shore, and to
expect hourly Orders to that Purpo&s;e, as likewi&s;e the Arrival of the Vice-King,
who&s;e Authority was more equal to that Attempt, and who was a
Man well known to have a particular Reverence for the King, and as parti|cular
a Prejudice and Animo&s;ity again&s;t the <HI>Dutch.</HI> The Night being over,
the Governour continued all the next Day as de&s;irous and importunate that
the Enterpri&s;e might be longer deferred; upon which there were &s;ome cho|lerick
Words between the Governour and a Gentleman of Quality who was
a Volunteer on Board the Ships, which many thought in &s;ome Degree irre|conciled
the Governour to the Affair.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30">IN Conclu&s;ion: The Commander of the Squadron was willing to think
that the Governour had rather it &s;hould be done without his declared Con|&s;ent
than by it, and &s;o told him, &startq;that the next Morning He was re&s;olved
to weigh his Anchors and to fall upon the <HI>Dutch;</HI>&endq; to which the other
made &s;uch a Reply as confirmed him in his former Imagination. And in
the Morning the Ships were brought out of their &s;everal Channels, and
placed as near the Sides of the <HI>Dutch</HI> as they could be, from whence
They re&s;olved to board them as &s;oon as They had &s;ent their Broad&s;ides upon
them. But They found that the <HI>Dutch</HI> had &s;pent their Time well; for in
the two Days and two Nights that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had been in the Harbour,
<MILESTONE N="40">be&s;ides the unlading the riche&s;t of their Commodities that were left into the
Ca&s;tle, They had drawn all their Ordnance, which lay on that Side of the
Ships which was to the Shore, on Land, and planted them upon a ri&s;ing
Ground, that They could &s;hoot over their own Ships upon the <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> And a
Brea&s;twork was ca&s;t up, behind which all the Inhabitants of the Town
were in Arms.</P>
<P>IT was a fair Warning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ill Succe&s;s of it.</NOTE> and might very well have per&s;uaded our Men to
be glad to retire out of the Harbour, which yet They might have done: But
their Courage or their Anger di&s;po&s;ed them to make farther Trial of the
Governour, for They feared not the Ordnance from the Land which the
<MILESTONE N="50"><HI>Dutch</HI> had planted, nor the Mu&s;kets from the Brea&s;tworks, if the Ca&s;tle did
them no Harm, under the Power of which They all were. And &s;o They fell
upon their Work: And in &s;ome Time, and with the Lo&s;s of many Men from
the Ships and from the Land, They had di&s;mounted many of the Ordnance upon
<PB N="280" REF="285">
the Shore, and were even ready to board the Ships; when out of ab&s;urd Rage
or Accident a Ship or two of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> di&s;charged &s;ome Guns both upon
the Brea&s;tworks, from whence They had received no Prejudice, and upon
the Town, which beat down &s;ome Hou&s;es. But then all the Mu&s;kets from
the Brea&s;tworks were poured out, and Guns from the Ca&s;tle, which killed
very many common Men, and five or &s;ix Officers of very good Account,
and &s;ome Gentlemen Volunteers, among&s;t which was <HI>Edward Mountague,</HI>
elde&s;t Son to the Lord <HI>Mountague</HI> of <HI>Boughton</HI> and Cou&s;in German to the
Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> a proper Man and wellbred but not ea&s;y to be plea&s;ed, and
who was then withdrawn from the Court, where He was Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e<MILESTONE N="10">
to the Queen, and in &s;ome Di&s;content had put him&s;elf on Board the Fleet
with a Captain, without the Privity of the Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> and was now
&s;lain. There was now no farther Experiment to be made, but how They
could get to Sea, which might ea&s;ily have been prevented from the Shore
and from the Rocks: But from the Minute that They prepared to be gone
and gave over &s;hooting, there was no more done again&s;t them, and They
had Pilots from the Country that carried them &s;afe out.</P>
<P>THE Noi&s;e of the Guns had called the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> as near the
Mouth of the Harbour as could &s;afely be, to di&s;cover what became of his
Squadron; &s;o that They came &s;hortly to him with the whole Account of<MILESTONE N="20">
their ill Succe&s;s, and within a &s;hort Time after a Shallop from the Governour,
with a Letter to the Officer who had commanded the Squadron, complaining
as much as He could do of the Mi&s;behaviour of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in &s;hooting upon
the Town, and de&s;iring &startq;that Mr. <HI>Clifford</HI> would give him a Meeting at a
Place He &startq;appointed, to which the Shallop &s;hould convey him.&endq; Mr.
<HI>Clifford</HI> was more willing to go than the Earl was to permit him; yet at
la&s;t upon his earne&s;t De&s;ire He con&s;ented, and He put him&s;elf into the
Shallop. It happened that when the Action was over and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
under Sail, the Vice-King arrived at <HI>Bergen</HI> with two or three Regiments
of the Country; and the Orders were likewi&s;e come from <HI>Copenhagen,</HI><MILESTONE N="30">
whereby, at lea&s;t as They pretended, They were required to permit all
that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> de&s;ired: And the Vice-King had cau&s;ed the Shallop to be
&s;ent, and was him&s;elf with the Governour at the Place whither Mr. <HI>Clifford</HI>
was to come, and there He &s;pake with them together.</P>
<P>THE Governour with many Prote&s;tations excu&s;ed him&s;elf for &s;hooting from
the Ca&s;tle, after the Town was a&s;&s;aulted, and many of the Burghers killed,
who had &s;tood in Arms only to defend the Town, without being concerned
for the <HI>Dutch</HI> or their Ships; and made it an Argument of his Integrity
and Re&s;pect, &startq;that He had permitted them to depart when it was in his
Power to have &s;unk them.&endq; He complained, &startq;that the Commander<MILESTONE N="40">
would not have the Patience to defer the A&s;&s;ault one Day longer, which
if He had done the Orders from <HI>Copenhagen</HI> had been come, and the
Vice-King had been pre&s;ent with his Forces, which would have &s;ecured
the Enterpri&s;e.&endq; The Vice-King &s;eemed very much troubled for what
had been done, and earne&s;tly de&s;ired &startq;that the &s;ame or another Squadron
might be again &s;ent in, when They &s;hould be at Liberty to do what
They would upon the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and if They &s;tood in Need of A&s;&s;i&s;tance
They &s;hould have as much as was nece&s;&s;ary.&endq;</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Clifford</HI> replied to many of the Excu&s;es which were made, and
urged &startq;the &s;uffering the <HI>Dutch</HI> to bring their Ordnance on Shore, and the<MILESTONE N="50">
Town&s;men being in Arms to a&s;&s;i&s;t them;&endq; and propo&s;ed, &startq;that They
would fir&s;t begin by &s;eizing upon &s;ome of their Ships, and then that their
Fleet &s;hould an&s;wer:&endq; But this the Vice-King did ab&s;olutely refu&s;e, and
<PB N="281" REF="286">
made another Propo&s;ition that &s;tartled more and was directly new, &startq;that
when the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had &s;eized upon all the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships, They &s;hould not
have carried any of them away till a perfect Divi&s;ion of the Goods was
made, that the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> might have his ju&s;t Proportion.&endq; Mr.
<HI>Clifford</HI> made no An&s;wer but &startq;that He would pre&s;ent all that They propo&s;ed
to the Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> in whom the Power of concluding and executing
remained &s;olely:&endq; And &s;o He returned to the Fleet, and They to the
Town and expected an An&s;wer.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> thought not fit to run any more Hazards,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Sandwich <HI>de|clines making another At|tempt.</HI></NOTE> and
<MILESTONE N="10">was not &s;atisfied that They had proceeded &s;incerely. But that which mo&s;t
prevailed with him was, that He had received Intelligence &startq;that <HI>De Ruyter</HI>
was come out with the Fleet,&endq; and He would not He &s;hould find him
entangled in tho&s;e Rocks, or obliged to fight with him upon that Coa&s;t;
and the Sea&s;on of the Year now made that Station very un&s;ecure, for it
was already the Beginning of <HI>October,</HI> when tho&s;e Seas run very high and
boi&s;terous: And therefore He re&s;olved to be Ma&s;ter of more Sea-Room,
that He might fight <HI>De Ruyter</HI> if He came, and if He did not He might
then meet tho&s;e <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Ships more &s;ecurely in their Way to <HI>Holland,</HI>
than by making another Attempt in the Harbour. And &s;o, after &s;ome
<MILESTONE N="20">Letters had pa&s;&s;ed and repa&s;&s;ed between the Vice-King and him, and both
the Vice-King and Governour had undertaken to keep the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships there
for the Space of &s;ix Weeks, for They de&s;ired to &s;ee the Succe&s;s of another
Engagement between the two Fleets; the Earl &s;teered that Way with his
Fleet that mo&s;t probably might bring him and <HI>De Ruyter</HI> together, which
above all Things He de&s;ired.</P>
<P>THIS whole Affair of <HI>Bergen</HI> and the Managery thereof was &s;o perplexed
and intricate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Author's Reflections upon this A&s;|&s;ain.</NOTE> that it was never clearly under&s;tood. That which &s;eemed to
have mo&s;t Probability was, that as &s;oon as the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet came to <HI>Bergen,</HI>
They had unladen many of their riche&s;t Commodities and put them into the
<MILESTONE N="30">Ca&s;tle, before the Governour had received his Orders from <HI>Copenhagen:</HI> And
&s;o both his own and his Ma&s;ter's Faith and Honour were engaged to di&s;charge
the Tru&s;t, of which He made Ha&s;te to &s;end an Account to the King, and
thereupon expected new Directions, which were not arrived when the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
Fleet came thither. And when they did come, whether that Court
according to its Cu&s;tom did change its Mind, and believe They &s;hould make
a better Bargain by keeping what was already depo&s;ited in their Hands in
the Ca&s;tle, than by making an uncertain Divi&s;ion with the King; or whe|ther
They did in Truth continue firm to the fir&s;t Agreement, and that the
Me&s;&s;enger was &s;topped by extraordinary Accidents in his Journey (which
<MILESTONE N="40">was po&s;itively alleged), &s;o that He did not arrive in Time; or whether the
Governour was not able to ma&s;ter the Town that was much inclined to the
<HI>Hollanders,</HI> before the Vice-King came with his Troops, who did make all
po&s;&s;ible Ha&s;te as &s;oon as He heard that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were arrived; or whe|ther
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> did proceed more unadvi&s;edly and ra&s;hly than They ought to
have done; remains &s;till in the Dark: And Both Parties reproached each other
afterwards, as They found mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;everal Defences and Pre|tences;
of which more hereafter.</P>
<P>THE King &s;tayed not altogether &s;o long at <HI>Sali&s;bury</HI> as He had intended
to have done:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King and the Court re|move to Ox|ford.</NOTE> For be&s;ides a little accidental Indi&s;po&s;ition which made him
<MILESTONE N="50">di&s;like the Air, &s;ome inferiour Servants and their Wives came from <HI>London</HI>
or the Villages adjacent, and brought the Plague with them; &s;o that the

left his Wife and Family to follow by ordinary Journeys, and him&s;elf
came to <HI>Oxford</HI> the next Day after the King, where there were indeed
Matters of the highe&s;t Importance to be con&s;ulted and re&s;olved?</P>
<P>THE King had &s;ent Mr. <HI>Clifford</HI> to <HI>Denmark</HI> to be &s;atisfied, upon Confe|rence

the Ships remained &s;till there according to the Promi&s;e the Vice-King
had made, and if that King were ready to perform what He had under|taken,
that all Particulars might be &s;o adju&s;ted that there might be no far|ther
Mi&s;take; and if He found that the Jealou&s;y of <HI>Sweden</HI> was a real Ob|&s;truction
to that Alliance, that He &s;hould make a Journey to <HI>Sweden,</HI> and
upon Conference with Mr. <HI>Coventry,</HI> who by his Dexterity and very good
Parts had reconciled the Affections of that Court to a very great E&s;teem of
him, endeavour to remove all tho&s;e Ob&s;tructions: And as &s;oon as his
Maje&s;ty &s;hould receive full Information of that whole Affair, He mu&s;t con|&s;ider
what He was to do to vindicate him&s;elf in that Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Bergen;</HI><MILESTONE N="20">
for He knew well that He mu&s;t &s;uffer with all the World, for violating the
Peace of a Port that was under the Government of a neighbour Prince with
whom He was allied, if He did not make it appear that He had the Con|&s;ent
of that Prince, which He was not willing to do till He fir&s;t knew what
that King would do.</P>
<P>IN the next Place his Maje&s;ty was to re&s;olve what An&s;wer to make to
the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;adours,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A farther Ne|gotiation with the</HI> French <HI>Amba&s;&s;adours.</HI></NOTE> who now de&s;ired frequent Audiences, and po&s;i|tively
declared, &startq;that their Ma&s;ter was engaged by his Treaty with the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> that in Ca&s;e They were invaded or a&s;&s;aulted by any Prince, He
would a&s;&s;i&s;t them with Men, Money and Ships, which He had hitherto de|ferred<MILESTONE N="30">
to do out of Re&s;pect to the King, and in Hope that He would ac|cept
his Mediation, and make &s;uch Propo&s;itions towards Peace as He
might pre&s;s the others to con&s;ent to.&endq; The <HI>Dutch</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour was
likewi&s;e come to Town, rather to treat concerning the Pri&s;oners and to ob|&s;erve
what the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;adours did, than that He had any Thing to
propo&s;e in Order to Peace, there appearing now &s;ince their Fleet was at Sea
more In&s;olence in the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and a greater Aver&s;ion from the Peace, than
had been formerly.</P>
<P>THE King complained to the Amba&s;&s;adours of the <HI>French</HI> King's Pro|ceedings,
&startq;that the entering into that Treaty was expre&s;&s;ly again&s;t his Word<MILESTONE N="40">
given to the King: That the <HI>Dutch</HI> had fir&s;t began the War, and ought
to make the fir&s;t Approach towards Peace, but that their Amba&s;&s;adour had
no In&s;truction to make any &s;uch In&s;tance; and therefore it &s;eemed very
&s;trange to his Maje&s;ty, that the <HI>French</HI> King &s;hould pre&s;s for that which
They had no De&s;ire to have.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Amba&s;&s;adours confe&s;&s;ed &startq;that the <HI>Dutch</HI> did not de&s;ire a Peace;
that They thought They were too much behindhand, and that They
had at pre&s;ent great Advantages; that They looked upon the great
Plague in <HI>London</HI>&endq; (which continued in its full Rage and Vigour, in&s;o|much
as at that Time in the End of <HI>September</HI> there died not &s;o few as &s;ix<MILESTONE N="50">
thou&s;and in the Week, among&s;t which &s;ome were of the be&s;t Quality in the
City) &startq;as of &s;uch in&s;upportable Damage to the King, that He would not
be able to &s;et out another Fleet the Year following: And therefore that,
<PB N="283" REF="288">
when They had been pre&s;&s;ed by the <HI>French</HI> King to make &s;ome Propo&s;itions
towards Peace, He could get no other An&s;wer from them, than <HI>that They
expected that the I&s;land of</HI> Poleroone <HI>&s;hould be relea&s;ed to them, and that the
Fort at</HI> Cabo Cor&s;o <HI>in</HI> Guinea <HI>&s;hould be thrown down and &s;lighted,</HI> which
They confe&s;&s;ed was an in&s;olent Propo&s;ition. That They complained
<HI>that the King their Ma&s;ter, in&s;tead of giving them the A&s;&s;i&s;tance He was
obliged to do, &s;pent the Time in procuring a Peace, which They cared not
for:</HI> So that,&endq; They &s;aid, &startq;their Ma&s;ter continued the &s;ame Chri&s;tian Of|fice
principally to do his Maje&s;ty of <HI>Great Britain</HI> a Service, who He
<MILESTONE N="10">in Truth believed would be reduced to great Streights by the terrible Ef|fect
of the Plague; and in the next Place to defend him&s;elf from entering
into the War, which He could no longer defer to do, if his Maje&s;ty did
not, by con&s;enting to &s;ome rea&s;onable Overture, give him a ju&s;t Occa&s;ion
to pre&s;s them to yield to it, and in that Ca&s;e He would behave him&s;elf in
that Manner that the King &s;hould have no Cau&s;e to complain of his Par|tiality.&endq;
The King's Indignation was &s;o provoked by the Pride and Im|pudence
of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Demands, that He gave the Amba&s;&s;adours no other
An&s;wer, than &startq;that He hoped God Almighty had not &s;ent that heavy
Judgment of the Plague upon him and his People on the Behalf of the

the Danger that was in the Towns infected, and
the nece&s;&s;ary Severity in other Towns to keep
them&s;elves, from being infected, it was a very
inconvenient Sea&s;on for all Per&s;ons of Quality to
travel from their own Habitations. Upon the
<MILESTONE N="10">tenth of <HI>October</HI> the King commanded Both
Hou&s;es to attend him in <HI>Chri&s;t-Church</HI> Hall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Speech to Roth $word$.</NOTE> and told them, &startq;that He was
confident They did all believe, that if it had not been ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary
to con&s;ult with them He would not have called them together at
that Time, when the Contagion had &s;pread it&s;elf over &s;o many Parts of
the Kingdom: And He thanked them for their Compliance &s;o far with
his De&s;ires.&endq;</P>
<P>HIS Maje&s;ty &s;aid, &startq;the Truth was; as He had entered upon the War
by their Advice and Encouragement, &s;o He de&s;ired that They might as
frequently as was po&s;&s;ible receive Information of the Effects and Conduct
<MILESTONE N="20">of it, and that He might have the Continuance of their cheerful Supply
for the carrying it on. He would not deny to them, that it had proved
<PB N="286" REF="290">
more chargeable than He could imagine it would have been: The Addi|tion
the Enemy had &s;till made to their Fleets, beyond their fir&s;t Purpo&s;e,
made it unavoidably nece&s;&s;ary for him to make proportionable Prepara|tions,
which God had hitherto ble&s;&s;ed with Succe&s;s in all Encounters.
And as They had u&s;ed their utmo&s;t Endeavours by Calumnies and fal&s;e
Sugge&s;tions to gain Friends to them&s;elves, and to per&s;uade them to a&s;&s;i&s;t
them again&s;t him, &s;o He had not been wanting to encourage tho&s;e Princes
who had been wronged by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> to recover their own by Force;
and in Order thereunto, He had a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> with a
great Sum of ready Money, and was to continue a Supply to him, who<MILESTONE N="10">
He believed was at that Time in the Bowels of their Country with a pow|erful
Army.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;THOSE I&s;&s;ues, which He might tell them had been made with very
much Conduct and Hu&s;bandry (nor indeed did He know that any Thing
had been &s;pent that could have been well and &s;afely &s;aved);&endq; He &s;aid,
&startq;tho&s;e Expen&s;es would not &s;uffer them to wonder, that the great Supply
which They gave him for this War in &s;o bountiful a Proportion was upon
the Matter already &s;pent: So that He mu&s;t not only expect an A&s;&s;i&s;tance
from them to carry on that War, but &s;uch an A&s;&s;i&s;tance as might enable
him to defend him&s;elf and them again&s;t a more powerful Neighbour, if<MILESTONE N="20">
He &s;hould prefer the Friend&s;hip of the <HI>Dutch</HI> before his.&endq;</P>
<P>HE put them in Mind, &startq;that when He entered upon this War He had
told them, <HI>that He had not &s;uch a brutal Appetite as to make War for
War's Sake;</HI> He was &s;till of the &s;ame Mind: He had been ready to re|ceive
any Propo&s;itions that <HI>France</HI> had thought fit to offer to that End,
but hitherto Nothing had been offered worthy his Acceptance; nor was
the <HI>Dutch</HI> le&s;s in&s;olent, though He knew no Advantage They had got but
the Continuance of the Contagion, and He hoped that God Almighty
would &s;hortly deprive them of that Encouragement.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Chancellor at the &s;ame Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sub&s;tance of the Chancel|lor's Speech.</NOTE> by the King's Command, made a<MILESTONE N="30">
&s;hort Narrative of the Hi&s;tory of the War, the Circum&s;tances with which
it was begun, and the Progre&s;s it had &s;ince made and the Victory that
the Duke had attained; of the va&s;t Number of the Pri&s;oners and &s;ick and
wounded Men, a Charge that had never been computed.</P>
<P>HE told them, &startq;the <HI>French</HI> King had indeed offered his Mediation, and
that if He intended no more than a Mediation, it was an Office very
worthy the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King; He wi&s;hed, that as a Mediator He
would make equal Propo&s;itions, or that He would not &s;o importunately
pre&s;s his Maje&s;ty to con&s;ent to tho&s;e He makes, upon an In&s;tance and Ar|gument,
<HI>that He holds him&s;elf engaged by a former Treaty</HI> (of which his<MILESTONE N="40">
Maje&s;ty had never heard till &s;ince the Beginning of the War, and had
&s;ome Rea&s;on to have pre&s;umed the contrary) <HI>to a&s;&s;i&s;t the</HI> Dutch <HI>with Men

<P>HE &s;aid, &startq;his Maje&s;ty had told them, <HI>that He had no Appetite to make
War for War's Sake;</HI> but He would be always ready to make &s;uch a
Peace as might be for his Honour and the Intere&s;t of his Subjects. And
no Doubt it would be a great Trouble and Grief to his Maje&s;ty to find &s;o
great a Prince, towards whom He had manife&s;ted &s;o great an Affection,
in Conjunction with his Enemies: Yet even the Apprehen&s;ion of &s;uch a
War would not terrify him to purcha&s;e a Peace by &s;uch Conce&s;&s;ions as<MILESTONE N="50">
He &s;hould be a&s;hamed to make them acquainted with; of which Nature
They would ea&s;ily believe the Propo&s;itions hitherto made to be, when
<PB N="287" REF="291">
They knew the Relea&s;e of <HI>Poleroone</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and the demoli&s;h|ing
the Fort of <HI>Cabo Cor&s;o</HI> upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI> were two; which
would be upon the Matter to be contented with a very vile Trade in the
<HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> under their Control, and with none in <HI>Guinea.</HI> And yet
tho&s;e are not Propo&s;itions unrea&s;onable enough to plea&s;e the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who
reproached <HI>France</HI> for interpo&s;ing for Peace, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting them in
the War, boldly in&s;i&s;ting upon the Advantage the Contagion in <HI>London</HI>
and &s;ome other Parts of the Kingdom gives them; by which, They con|fidently
&s;ay, the King will be no longer able to maintain a Fleet again&s;t
<MILESTONE N="10">them at Sea.&endq;</P>
<P>HE told them, &startq;that He had fully obeyed the Command that had been
laid upon him, in making that plain, clear, true Narrative of what had
pa&s;&s;ed; He had no Order to make Reflection upon it, nor any Deduc|tion
from it: The King him&s;elf had told them, <HI>that the noble, unparalleled
Supply They had already given him is upon the Matter &s;pent,</HI> &s;pent with all the
Animadver&s;ions of good Hu&s;bandry that the Nature of the Affair would
bear. What was more to be done He left to their own generous Under|&s;tandings,
being not more a&s;&s;ured of any Thing that was to come in this
World, than that the &s;ame noble Indignation for the Honour of the King
<MILESTONE N="20">and the Nation, that fir&s;t provoked them to inflame the King him&s;elf, would
continue the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ion &s;till boiling in their loyal Brea&s;ts; that all the

joint, in&s;eparable Honour, as their only &s;ure infallible Expedient to pre|&s;erve
their di&s;tinct &s;everal Intere&s;ts.&endq;</P>
<P>THE King could not expect or wi&s;h a fuller Concurrence from a Parlia|ment
than He now found.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A farther Supply grant|ed.</NOTE> With very little He&s;itation They declared, &startq;that
They would &s;upply his Maje&s;ty with another Million (ten hundred thou|&s;and
Pounds):&endq; And becau&s;e They de&s;ired to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed as &s;oon as
<MILESTONE N="30">might be to their &s;everal Habitations, not without Apprehen&s;ion that &s;o

the Term was likewi&s;e adjourned to <HI>Oxford</HI>), might bring the Contagion
thither likewi&s;e; They rejected all other Bu&s;ine&s;&s;es but what immediately
related to the Publick. To the Supply They de&s;igned to the King They
added the Sum of above forty thou&s;and Pounds, which They de&s;ired his
Maje&s;ty to confer upon the Duke, having received &s;ome In&s;inuation, &startq;that
it would not be ingrateful to the King that &s;uch a Pre&s;ent &s;hould be
made to his Brother.&endq;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An Act for attainting the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>in the</HI> Dutch <HI>Ser|vice.</HI></NOTE> Then They pa&s;&s;ed two or three Acts of Parlia|ment
very much for the King's Honour and Security, among&s;t which one
<MILESTONE N="40">was, &startq;for the attainting all tho&s;e his Subjects who either re&s;ided in <HI>Holland</HI>&endq;
(as &s;ome of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Officers who had long &s;erved in that Country pre|&s;umed
&s;till to do) &startq;and continued in their Service, or in any other Parts
beyond the Seas, if They did not appear at a Day prefixed, after Notice
by the King's Proclamation:&endq; And the Nomination of the Per&s;ons was en|tirely
left to his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>HIS Maje&s;ty did hope, that this very good Carriage in the Parliament
would have made &s;ome Impre&s;&s;ion upon <HI>France,</HI> either to have given over
their Mediation, or to have drawn rea&s;onable and ju&s;t Conce&s;&s;ions from the
<HI>States:</HI> But it did produce the contrary. The <HI>Hollander</HI> had received a
<MILESTONE N="50">new Damage which inflamed them exceedingly, which &s;hall be particularly
mentioned in the next Place, whereupon They made grievous Complaints to
<HI>France</HI> of its Breach of Faith upon the Promi&s;es that had been made to
them. That King upon this required his Amba&s;&s;adours once more to make
<PB N="288" REF="292">
a lively In&s;tance to his Maje&s;ty, &startq;that He would declare what He meant
to in&s;i&s;t upon in Order to a Peace, which if He &s;hould refu&s;e to do, They
&s;hould take their Leaves and return into <HI>France</HI> with all po&s;&s;ible Expedi|tion.&endq;
In this Audience They &s;pake in a higher Style than They had
formerly u&s;ed.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> French <HI>Amba&s;&s;adours remon&s;trate warmly a|gain&s;t the</HI> Engli&s;h.</NOTE> They complained &startq;of the intolerable Damage the Subjects
of <HI>France</HI> had &s;u&s;tained in their Goods and E&s;tates by the King's Ships,
and tho&s;e who were licen&s;ed by his Authority, which without any Di&s;|tinction
&s;eized upon all that came in their Way as if They were <HI>Dutch:</HI>
And when They complained to the Admiralty or to the Lords Commi&s;|&s;ioners,
They could procure no Ju&s;tice, and were obliged to &s;uch an At|tendance<MILESTONE N="10">
and Expen&s;e, that what They &s;ued for did not prove of Value to
&s;atisfy the Charge of the Pro&s;ecution; and if after a long and a tedious So|licitation
They did at la&s;t procure a Sentence for the Redelivery of what
had been taken from them, when They hoped to enjoy the Benefit of
this ju&s;t Sentence by the Execution, They found the Goods embezzled in
the Port or plundered by the Seamen, that the Owners had rarely a third
Part of their Goods ever re&s;tored to them. And that by this Violence
and unju&s;t Proceeding, of which They had often made Complaint, the
<HI>French</HI> Merchants had lo&s;t near five hundred thou&s;and <HI>Pi&s;toles;</HI> which
their Ma&s;ter re&s;ented and looked upon as a great Indignity to him&s;elf,<MILESTONE N="20">
which He had hitherto borne, in Hope that the Licen&s;e would have been
re&s;trained by the End of the War.&endq;</P>
<P>THEY urged it as an Argument of their Ma&s;ter's Friend&s;hip to the King,
&startq;that after an offen&s;ive Treaty had been &s;o long &s;ince entered into by him,
by which He was obliged to a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>Dutch</HI> with Men, Money and
Ships, He had notwith&s;tanding hitherto forborne it, and looked on whil&s;t
They were &s;oundly beaten and had lately &s;u&s;tained another Blow; and
that it was not po&s;&s;ible for him to defer it longer:&endq; And &s;o concluded
with very earne&s;t Per&s;ua&s;ions, &startq;that his Maje&s;ty would con&s;ent to &s;uch a
Peace as their Ma&s;ter &s;hould judge to be rea&s;onable, who could not but<MILESTONE N="30">
be very ju&s;t to his Maje&s;ty;&endq; and wi&s;hed, &startq;that it might be con&s;idered,
be&s;ides the Damage by the Plague which Nobody knew how long it might
continue, how impo&s;&s;ible it was for the King to &s;u&s;tain the Arms of <HI>France</HI>
in Conjunction to tho&s;e of <HI>Holland,</HI> when po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome other Prince might
join likewi&s;e with them.&endq;</P>
<P>THEY who were appointed by the King to confer with the Amba&s;&s;adours
were mo&s;t perplexed to ju&s;tify their fir&s;t Charge,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Conference between them and the</HI> Eng|li&s;h <HI>Mini&s;ters upon their Re|mon&s;trance.</HI></NOTE> &startq;of the Depredation that
had been made upon the <HI>French</HI> Merchants,&endq; which had in Truth been
very great, though not amounting to the Sum They mentioned. Yet to
that They an&s;wered, &startq;that the Damage and Lo&s;s which the Subjects of<MILESTONE N="40">
<HI>France</HI> had undergone that Way had originally proceeded from them&s;elves,
and their own Default in owning the Goods and Merchandi&s;e of the
<HI>Dutch</HI> to belong to them&s;elves as their proper Goods, and in undertaking
to carry and deliver the Wine and other Goods, which were bought and
paid for in <HI>France</HI> by the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> in <HI>French</HI> Ve&s;&s;els in that Country;
all which had been fully and notoriou&s;ly proved and could not be con|tradicted:
And when that Di&s;covery was once made, it was no Won|der
if the Seamen &s;ometimes &s;eized upon &s;ome Ve&s;&s;els which were not
liable to the &s;ame Reproach. But when any Complaints of that Kind
had been made, the King had always given &s;trict Charge to the Judges to<MILESTONE N="50">
cau&s;e Re&s;titution to be made, and the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors to be &s;everely pu|ni&s;hed;
and his Maje&s;ty pre&s;umed that the Judges had done their Duty.
For the <HI>French</HI> King's being bound by his Treaty to a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>Hollanders,</HI>&endq;
<PB N="289" REF="293">
They &s;aid, &startq;that if the King had any &s;uch Obligation upon him, it was
&s;ub&s;equent to his Obligation to his Maje&s;ty, by which He was bound to
make no &s;uch Treaty: Nor in Truth did They believe that He had en|tered
into any &s;uch Treaty, for if it were only &s;uch as They them&s;elves
&s;tated it to be, a defen&s;ive League, it would neither engage nor excu&s;e
<HI>France</HI> in giving A&s;&s;i&s;tance to them who had done the Wrong and begun
the War; and therefore if the King was in Truth bound to a&s;&s;i&s;t them,
it mu&s;t be from &s;ome offen&s;ive not defen&s;ive Clau&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Amba&s;&s;adours replied, &startq;that their Ma&s;ter concluded that their
<MILESTONE N="10">King was the Aggre&s;&s;or, and then the defen&s;ive Article did oblige him;&endq;
and They acknowledged there was no other. It was an&s;wered, &startq;that the King
had a&s;&s;umed a Power to judge upon a Matter of Fact of which He had
taken no Examination; and that it was a Partiality not agreeable to the
Office of a Judge, to believe what the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;aid, and not to believe
what the King &s;aid, who had clearly publi&s;hed the true Hi&s;tory of the
Fact; and that it was notorious and not po&s;&s;ible to be denied, that They
had refu&s;ed to deliver <HI>Poleroone</HI> according to their Treaty, and that <HI>De

&s;eized on by the King.&endq; To which They replied, &startq;that their Ma&s;ter
<MILESTONE N="20">thought otherwi&s;e, and did look upon the King as Aggre&s;&s;or.&endq; When
They were urged with the Violation of the former Obligation by entering
into the latter, all the An&s;wer They gave was, &startq;that They knew Nothing
of it, and that They had Commi&s;&s;ion only to treat upon the pre&s;ent
State of Affairs, and not upon what had pa&s;&s;ed long before:&endq; And &s;o,
according to the Character They underwent near fourteen hundred Years

<P>THE Coun&s;ellors of the King told them, &startq;that their Ma&s;ter had very
well con&s;idered the Di&s;advantage He mu&s;t undergo by the Acce&s;s of &s;o
powerful a Friend, and of who&s;e Friend&s;hip He had thought him&s;elf po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed,
<MILESTONE N="30">to the Part of his Enemies, who were too in&s;olent already; and
therefore to prevent that Di&s;advantage, He had and would do any Thing
that would con&s;i&s;t with the Dignity of a King: But that He mu&s;t be
laughed at and de&s;pi&s;ed by all the World, if He &s;hould con&s;ent to make
him the Arbitrator of the Differences who had already declared him&s;elf to
be a Party, and <HI>that He is re&s;olved to make War again&s;t him on the Be|half
of his Enemy;</HI> and that &s;uch Menaces would make no Impre&s;&s;ion in
the la&s;t Article of Danger that could befall the King.&endq; The Amba&s;&s;a|dours
took that Expre&s;&s;ion of Menaces very heavily, as if it were a Tax upon
their Manners, and &s;aid &startq;They had never u&s;ed Words that could imply a
<MILESTONE N="40">Menace.&endq; To which it was replied, &startq;that there was no Purpo&s;e to make
any Reflection upon their Per&s;ons, who had always carried them&s;elves with
great Re&s;pect to the King, and who his Maje&s;ty believed did in their own
particular Affection wi&s;h him better than They did the <HI>Dutch:</HI> However
the declaring, <HI>that if the King did not do this or that, the</HI> French <HI>King
would make War upon him,</HI> could in no Language be looked upon to have
any other Signification than of a Menace and Threat.&endq; This rai&s;ed a little
Warmth on Both Sides, which made the Conference break off at that Time.</P>
<P>THE Amba&s;&s;adours prepared to be gone; and the King di&s;cerned clearly
that there was no Way to divert the <HI>French</HI> from an entire Conjunction
<MILESTONE N="50">with the <HI>Dutch:</HI> And thereupon He a&s;&s;embled his &s;ecret Council together
again, to con&s;ult what &s;hould be the final An&s;wer his Maje&s;ty &s;hould give
to the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;adours at parting. There was no Per&s;on pre&s;ent, who
had not a deep Apprehen&s;ion of the extreme Damage and Danger that
<PB N="290" REF="294">
mu&s;t fall upon the King's Affairs, if in this Conjuncture <HI>France</HI> &s;hould de|clare
a War again&s;t <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>IT was well known,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pro&s;pect of the King's Affairs at this Time.</NOTE> that the Duke of <HI>Beaufort</HI> was forthwith to be at <HI>Bre&s;t,</HI>
where all the <HI>French</HI> King's Ships were to a&s;&s;emble at their Rendezvous by
<HI>Chri&s;tmas;</HI> that the <HI>French</HI> King had already &s;ent to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI>
to di&s;&s;uade him from pro&s;ecuting his Enterpri&s;e again&s;t <HI>Holland,</HI> and that
probably He might unite <HI>Denmark</HI> again to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and probably even
allay tho&s;e warm Inclinations which the <HI>Swede</HI> had for the King. It was
well known, that the <HI>French</HI> King had in the la&s;t Di&s;tractions in <HI>Holland</HI>
contributed very much to the compo&s;ing them, and to the Support of the<MILESTONE N="10">
Power and Credit of <HI>De Wit,</HI> who was the Soul of the War, and that He
had &s;ent him one hundred thou&s;and <HI>Pi&s;toles,</HI> without which They would
have hardly been able to have &s;et out their la&s;t Fleet under <HI>De Ruyter.</HI>
And above all this, his giving Life to &s;ome dome&s;tick Rebellion in <HI>England</HI>
and in <HI>Ireland,</HI> by &s;ending Money to di&s;contented Per&s;ons, was apprehended:
For as there were enough di&s;contented and de&s;perate Per&s;ons in the latter, who
wanted only Arms and Money to declare for any Prince who would take
them into his Protection; &s;o it was well known that there was a general
Combination among&s;t tho&s;e of the late Army to have ri&s;en, if the Duke of
<HI>York</HI> had been defeated at Sea, and that it was that Victory that di&s;ap|pointed<MILESTONE N="20">
that intended In&s;urrection. That there had been a later De&s;ign, in
the very Height of this di&s;mal Sickne&s;s and Contagion, in <HI>London</HI> (whither
the Fanatick Party had repaired from all the Quarters of the Kingdom, and
had appointed a Day upon which the General &s;hould be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, which
&s;ome Soldiers of his own Regiment had undertaken, and then the whole
Rendezvous was to be in &s;everal Streets at the &s;ame Time); which in &s;o for|midable
a Conjuncture might have &s;ucceeded to a great Degree, if by God's
Ble&s;&s;ing it had not been di&s;covered two Days before to the General, who
cau&s;ed &s;ome of the chief Con&s;pirators to be apprehended, who &s;uffered after|wards
by the Hand of Ju&s;tice. And yet the Chief among&s;t them, Colonel<MILESTONE N="30">
<HI>Danvers,</HI> who in Spite of all the Vigilance that could be u&s;ed had been al|ways
&s;earched for and always concealed from the Time of the King's Re|turn,
being at this Time apprehended and brought before the General, and
by him &s;ent with a Lieutenant and a Guard of Soldiers to the <HI>Tower,</HI> was
re&s;cued in <HI>Cheap&s;ide,</HI> and &s;o e&s;caped, all the Citizens looking on without
aiding the Officer.</P>
<P>THIS was the Pro&s;pect that the King had of his Condition and Affairs in
this Con&s;ultation: And therefore if any Thing could have occurred that
might probably have diverted this Storm, it would no Doubt have been em|braced.
But then the exceeding Breach of Faith in entering into that<MILESTONE N="40">
Treaty, the denying it afterwards, and concealing his Engagement by it &s;o
long after the War was entered into (which if He had not done the King
could never have looked upon him as a fit Mediator), and the Impo&s;&s;ibility
of depending upon any Thing that &s;hould be promi&s;ed for the future, were
convincing Arguments again&s;t any &s;uch Reference of the Conditions to his
Determination as was propo&s;ed, and was the only Expedient that was pro|po&s;ed
towards the making a Peace. It was well known that the chief Coun&s;els
of <HI>France,</HI> &s;ince <HI>Mon&s;ieur Colbert</HI> entered upon the Mini&s;try, had been di|rected
towards the Advancement of Manufactures at Home, by which They
might have le&s;s Need of Commerce with their Neighbours; and for the<MILESTONE N="50">
erecting a Trade abroad, with which They had been very little acquainted
in former Times. And it was ju&s;tly to be feared, that where the Judgment
was left to them, They would imitate the infamous <HI>Roman</HI> Precedent, of
<PB N="291" REF="295">
adjudging that to them&s;elves that was in Difference between their Neigh|bours
and left to their Deci&s;ion: And &s;o both <HI>Poleroone</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI>
and <HI>Cabo Cor&s;o</HI> for the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> mu&s;t be determined to belong to them; which
might be the rather apprehended, by their having erected an <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI>
Company and a <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Company, before They had any vi&s;ible Founda|tion
for a Trade in either, to which Both the&s;e Places might carry with
them great Conveniences.</P>
<P>THESE Con&s;iderations being &s;eriou&s;ly reflected upon,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A final An|&s;wer given to the</HI> French <HI>Amba&s;&s;adours.</HI></NOTE> with a little gene|rous
Indignation to find him&s;elf thus treated, prevailed with the King to
<MILESTONE N="10">lay a&s;ide all Thoughts of farther complying with <HI>France,</HI> and to re&s;olve to
di&s;mi&s;s the Amba&s;&s;adours without any other An&s;wer, than what &s;hould con|tain
Complaints &startq;of the <HI>French</HI> King's Want of Kindne&s;s, which his Ma|je&s;ty
had cultivated by all the Offices He could perform &s;ince his Re&s;to|ration,
which did not receive an equal Return, by the preferring the
Friend&s;hip of the <HI>Dutch</HI> before that of his Maje&s;ty.&endq; And with this An|&s;wer
the Amba&s;&s;adours were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They leave the Kingdom.</NOTE> with liberal Pre&s;ents and all gracious
Demon&s;trations of E&s;teem of their Per&s;ons, and &s;o returned for <HI>France,</HI>
where They always gave ju&s;t Te&s;timony of the Civilities and fair Treatment
They had received.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20">BUT this Re&s;olution increa&s;ed the King's Appetite to Peace, and made
him think of all other Expedients that might contribute to it; and none
&s;eemed &s;o hopeful, as that <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> might be divided: And He
would have been very willing to have agreed with <HI>Holland</HI> upon any rea&s;on|able
Conditions,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Pro&s;pect of dividing</HI> France <HI>and</HI> Holland.</NOTE> that He might continue the War with <HI>France,</HI> which there
were many rea&s;onable Inducements to hope might be brought to pa&s;s. It
was notorious, that Preparations had been made for two or three Years pa&s;t
by <HI>France</HI> at a very great Expen&s;e upon the Borders, that They might
be ready to enter into <HI>Flanders</HI> as &s;oon as News &s;hould arrive of the King
of <HI>Spain's</HI> Death; and that War would immediately fall out as &s;oon as that
<MILESTONE N="30">King's Decea&s;e &s;hould be known, which from his Age and Infirmities mu&s;t
be expected every Day: And in that Ca&s;e the Friend&s;hip could not continue
long with <HI>Holland,</HI> which thought that <HI>France</HI> was already too near a
Neighbour to them, to be willing that They &s;hould be nearer by a Con|que&s;t
of <HI>Flanders,</HI> which with its own Force could not make an equal Re|&s;i&s;tance.
It was likewi&s;e as notorious that all the other Provinces, <HI>Holland</HI>
only excepted, did impatiently de&s;ire the Peace; and <HI>Holland</HI> had only been
re&s;tained from the &s;ame Impatience by the &s;ole Credit and Authority of <HI>De
Wit,</HI> and by his per&s;uading them, &startq;that <HI>France</HI> would a&s;&s;i&s;t them with
Men, Money and Ships, and likewi&s;e declare a War again&s;t <HI>England,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="40">which&endq; (as hath been &s;aid before) &startq;would produce a Peace upon &s;uch
Conditions as would make it happy to them:&endq; And that though it was
true that it had indeed a&s;&s;i&s;ted them with &s;ome Money, it was not con&s;iderable
to their va&s;t Expen&s;es, nor in Truth of Importance in Compari&s;on of the
other, which it was equally obliged to do, and had performed Nothing.
And it was evident that <HI>Holland</HI> it&s;elf was jealous of tho&s;e Proceedings, and
even <HI>De Wit</HI> in his private Di&s;cour&s;es to other Mini&s;ters &s;eemed to be
much un&s;atisfied with their Breach of Faith, and not to be without Appre|hen&s;ion
that They would in the End enter into a &s;tricter Alliance with <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
and leave <HI>Holland</HI> as a Prey to Both.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50">THE <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour, who always de&s;ired that the Peace might be

join with <HI>Spain</HI> in a defen&s;ive League, into which <HI>Denmark</HI> would be glad

<PB N="292" REF="296">

to interpo&s;e, was now very glad that the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;adours had taken their

the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour at the <HI>Hague,</HI> that the <HI>Dutch</HI> had tho&s;e Incli|nations
which are mentioned before, &startq;and that <HI>De Wit</HI> would be glad to
confer in private with any Man tru&s;ted by the King, if He might be &s;ure

which He had a &s;ecret Intelligence, to which He gave more Credit<MILESTONE N="10">
than to all the re&s;t, which &s;hall be mentioned hereafter.</P>
<P>THERE were &s;o many great Tran&s;actions during the King's Re&s;idence in
<HI>Oxford,</HI> be&s;ides what was done in the Parliament and what related to the
Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;adours, &s;o many Coun&s;els which were exe|cuted,
and &s;o many &s;ecret De&s;igns only initiated then and not executed till
long after, that there cannot be too particular a Recollection of the Occur|rences
of all that Time. And if &s;ome Things are mentioned which &s;eem too
light and of too &s;mall Importance to have a Place in this Relation, they
will be found at la&s;t to be the Ri&s;e and principal Ingredient to &s;ome Coun&s;el
and Re&s;olution, which proved afterwards of Con&s;equence enough as well to<MILESTONE N="20">
the Publick as to the Intere&s;t of particular Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Attempt that was made was to make a Breach between the
Chancellor and the Trea&s;urer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Attempt to break the Friend&s;hip be|tween the Chancellor and Trea&s;urer.</NOTE> who had been long fa&s;t Friends, and were
believed to have mo&s;t Credit with the King; and They who loved neither
of them thought the mo&s;t likely Way to hurt them was to make them love
one another le&s;s. Several Attempts had been made upon the Chancellor to
that Purpo&s;e without Effect: He knew the other too well to be &s;haken in
the E&s;teem He had of his Friend&s;hip, and the Knowledge He had of
his Virtue.</P>
<P>BUT there was now an Accident fell out, that gave them an Opportunity<MILESTONE N="30">
to &s;ugge&s;t to the Trea&s;urer, &startq;that the Chancellor had failed in his Friend|&s;hip
towards him.&endq;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Occa&s;ion of it.</NOTE> The Occa&s;ion was upon the Vacancy of an Office
near the Queen by the Death of Mr. <HI>Mountague,</HI> Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e to
her Maje&s;ty, who had been killed before <HI>Bergen:</HI> And the News arriving
with the Duke at <HI>York,</HI> before it was known at <HI>Sali&s;bury</HI> to the King, the
Duke and his Wife writ to the King and to the Queen &startq;to confer that
Place upon his younger Brother,&endq; who was now become both the elde&s;t
and the only Son to his Father, the Lord <HI>Mountague</HI> of <HI>Boughton;</HI> and the
Gentleman him&s;elf, on who&s;e Behalf the Letters were writ, came him&s;elf
by Po&s;t with them within two or three Hours after the News was brought to <HI>Sa|li&s;bury,</HI><MILESTONE N="40">
and He brought likewi&s;e a Letter from the Dutche&s;s to the Chan|cellor,
&startq;to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Gentleman all He could in his Pretence,&endq; He at the
&s;ame Time enjoying the &s;ame Office under the Dutche&s;s that his Brother had
under the Queen.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor had never u&s;ed to interpo&s;e in Matters of that Nature,
nor had He any Acquaintance with this Gentleman who was now recom|mended:
Yet He could not refu&s;e to wait upon the Queen and &s;hew her
the Letter He had received, without any Intention to appear farther in it.
But when He waited upon the Queen, who had received her Letter before,
her Maje&s;ty &s;eemed graciou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed to gratify the Gentleman if the King<MILESTONE N="50">
approved it, but &s;aid &startq;that She would make no Choice her&s;elf of any
Servant without knowing fir&s;t his Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure:&endq; And She added,
that She had been informed, <HI>that the Lord</HI> Mountague <HI>was very angry
<PB N="293" REF="297">
with his Son that was unfortunately &s;lain, for having taken that Charge in
her Family, and that He never allowed him any Thing towards his Sup|port;</HI>
and if all other Ob&s;tructions were out of the Way, She would not
receive him except She were fir&s;t a&s;&s;ured that his Father would like and
de&s;ire it.&endq; Her Maje&s;ty vouch&s;afed to wi&s;h the Chancellor &startq;to &s;peak with
the King, and as dexterou&s;ly as He could to di&s;po&s;e him to recommend
Mr. <HI>Mountague</HI> to her, as ju&s;t and rea&s;onable &s;ince his Brother had lo&s;t
his Life in his Service.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS Command of her Maje&s;ty obliged the Chancellor to wait upon the
<MILESTONE N="10">King, and to &s;hew him the Letter He had received from the Dutche&s;s; and
at the &s;ame Time the King gave him that which He had from the Duke,
in which his Highne&s;s de&s;ired him, &startq;that if that Place was not pre&s;ently
conferred upon Mr. <HI>Mountague,</HI> his Maje&s;ty would not di&s;po&s;e of it till
He waited upon him.&endq; The Chancellor told him, &startq;that the Queen gave
no An&s;wer, but referred it entirely to his Maje&s;ty:&endq; And He &s;aid, &startq;He
would never recommend any Per&s;on to her but &s;uch a one as would be
very grateful to her.&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;it would &s;eem very hard to deny one
Brother to &s;ucceed another who was killed in his Service.&endq; He confe&s;&s;ed,
that the Lord <HI>Crofts</HI> had moved him on the Behalf of Mr. <HI>Robert Spen|cer,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="20">of whom He had a good Opinion: But that He had an&s;wered him,
that He would not do any Thing in it till He &s;aw his <HI>Brother;</HI> which Re|&s;olution
He would keep.&endq; To which the Chancellor made no Reply,
having in his own private Inclinations and Affection much more Kindne&s;s
for Mr. <HI>Spencer,</HI> of who&s;e Pretence He had never received the lea&s;t Inti|mation
before, than for the other, with whom He had &s;poken very few
Words in his Life. He told Mr. <HI>Mountague</HI> no more but that which the
King him&s;elf had told him, <HI>&startq;that He would not di&s;po&s;e of the Place till the
Duke &s;hould arrive;&endq;</HI> only He added what the Queen had &s;aid of his Fa|ther,
and advi&s;ed him to think of the Way to remove that Ob&s;truction.
<MILESTONE N="30">Whereupon He re&s;olved to make a Journey to his Father, which He knew
He might well do before the King and his Brother could meet.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame Night Mr. <HI>Spencer</HI> came to the Chancellor, and brought him
a Letter from the Trea&s;urer (who&s;e Nephew He was, and who was unfor|tunately
gone out of the Town the Day before to a Hou&s;e of his own twenty
Miles di&s;tant) to recommend his Nephew to the Queen, to whom and to
the King He had likewi&s;e Letters. The Chancellor gave him an Account
of all that had pa&s;&s;ed, &s;hewed him the Letter that He had received from the
Dutche&s;s, and told him what the Queen and the King had &s;aid, and &startq;that
it was not po&s;&s;ible for him to do him Service, for which He was very &s;orry;&endq;
<MILESTONE N="40">but advi&s;ed him &startq;to deliver Both his Letters, and to attend their Maje&s;ties,
who He was confident had yet taken no Re&s;olution:&endq; With all which He
was very well &s;atisfied, and confe&s;&s;ed &startq;He could not expect that He &s;hould
appear for him.&endq; When He delivered his Letters to Both their Maje&s;ties,
He received &s;o gracious an An&s;wer from Both, that He might rea&s;onably
expect his Suit to be granted, though the King told him, &startq;He would not
di&s;po&s;e of the Place till He &s;pake with his Brother.&endq; And there is no
Doubt but if the Lord Trea&s;urer had been in the Town when the News
fir&s;t came to the King of Mr. <HI>Mountague's</HI> Death, which was a whole Day
before the Arrival of the Duke's Letter, the King or Queen would not
<MILESTONE N="50">have denied him his Reque&s;t.</P>
<P>WITHIN a &s;hort Time after Mr. <HI>Spencer</HI> had left him, the Lord <HI>Crofts,</HI>
who had married his Si&s;ter, and was governed by the Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> came
to the Chancellor, and de&s;ired him &startq;to take Care, out of his Friend&s;hip
<PB N="294" REF="298">
with the Trea&s;urer, that the King might not refu&s;e to gratify him in this
Suit for his Nephew, which was the fir&s;t He had ever made, and if He
&s;hould be denied it would exceedingly trouble him. That when He &s;pake
to the King of it as &s;oon as the News came, and told him, <HI>He was &s;ure
that the Trea&s;urer would be a Suitor to him for his Nephew,</HI> his Maje&s;ty
did promi&s;e him that He &s;hould have it; and that Both their Maje&s;ties had
as good as &s;aid the &s;ame now to <HI>Robert Spencer:</HI> And therefore if He
would now u&s;e his Credit, the Thing might be di&s;patched pre&s;ently and
without farther Delay.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Chancellor a&s;ked him, &startq;whether Mr. <HI>Spencer</HI> had informed him of<MILESTONE N="10">
all that had pa&s;&s;ed between them two:&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;Yes; and that He had
done all that the Dutche&s;s had de&s;ired him, in &s;peaking both to the King
and Queen, and that his Friend&s;hip to the Lord Trea&s;urer &s;hould pre|vail
with him to u&s;e all his Endeavours for his Nephew.&endq; Whereupon
the Chancellor &s;hewed the Dutche&s;s's Letter, and repeated to him again
all that He had formerly &s;aid to Mr. <HI>Spencer,</HI> and a&s;ked him, &startq;what the
Duke and his Wife mu&s;t think of him, if in&s;tead of pur&s;uing what They
de&s;ired, He &s;hould &s;olicit quite contrary to it.&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;that He might
tell them that He was engaged by the Lord Trea&s;urer before He received
their Letter;&endq; and then talked pa&s;&s;ionately and indi&s;creetly &startq;of the Af|front<MILESTONE N="20">
the Trea&s;urer would think He received if this were denied him, and
that all the World would &s;ay, that He might have compa&s;&s;ed it if He
had not failed in his Friend&s;hip.&endq; To which He made no other An&s;wer,
than &startq;that the doing &s;o ba&s;e a Thing as He de&s;ired would more probably de|&s;troy
that Friend&s;hip with a Man &s;o punctual in Honour and Ju&s;tice as the
Trea&s;urer was, than any Thing that He had done or &s;hould leave undone;&endq;
and advi&s;ed him &startq;not to make the Bu&s;ine&s;s wor&s;e by his Activity, and that
if He had the King's and Queen's Promi&s;e, as He pretended, He might very
well acquie&s;ce till the Duke came.&endq;</P>
<P>HOWEVER his very great Indi&s;cretion and Pre&s;umption made the Thing<MILESTONE N="30">
much wor&s;e, by delivering Me&s;&s;ages from the King to the Queen and
from her Maje&s;ty to the King that They Both di&s;avowed, and by his
u&s;ual Di&s;cour&s;es, &startq;that it &s;hould now appear who had the mo&s;t Credit
with the King, the Duke or the Trea&s;urer, and how much the King
would &s;uffer if He di&s;obliged the Trea&s;urer;&endq; all which was quickly
tran&s;mitted by the Intelligence that was every Day &s;ent to <HI>York.</HI> On the
other Hand He &s;till advi&s;ed the Trea&s;urer &startq;to continue his Importunity to
the King and Queen&endq; (a Thing the mo&s;t contrary to his Nature), and
a&s;&s;ured him, &startq;that it would be grateful to them and was expected by
them.&endq; Whereupon as &s;oon as the Trea&s;urer came to the Court, which<MILESTONE N="40">
was not till the King came to <HI>Oxford,</HI> He went to Both their Maje&s;ties,
and renewed his Suit to them with more Warmth and Concernment than
was cu&s;tomary to him, and received &s;uch an An&s;wer from Both as very well
&s;atisfied him: And without Doubt the King intended to per&s;uade his Bro|ther
to de&s;i&s;t from pre&s;&s;ing him father on the Behalf of the other, for whom
He had no Kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT the Duke, who arrived by Po&s;t the very next Day, came in another
Temper than was expected. The Intelligence from <HI>Sali&s;bury</HI> of the Con|te&s;t
that was for that Place, and the in&s;olent Behaviour and Expre&s;&s;ions
u&s;ed by the Lord <HI>Crofts,</HI> had exceedingly moved him, and He looked<MILESTONE N="50">
upon the Trea&s;urer as engaged to try who had the greate&s;t Power, and as
in Oppo&s;ition to him: So that the &s;ame Night that He came to Town,
when the King and He were in private, He complained of it with much
<PB N="295" REF="299">
Warmth; and He be&s;ought his Maje&s;ty importunately &startq;that He would de|clare,
that the World might know who had mo&s;t Intere&s;t in his Favour,
He or the Trea&s;urer.&endq; The King was &s;o much put out of the Method
He intended to u&s;e in this Affair, knowing that the Expre&s;&s;ions the Duke
had mentioned had been too often u&s;ed by the Lord <HI>Crofts,</HI> for which
He had often reprehended him, that He pre&s;ently applied that Remedy
which He thought mo&s;t proper, and after Conference with the Queen &s;igned
the Warrant for admitting Mr. <HI>Mountague</HI> into the Office, who was &s;worn
the next Morning: So that the fir&s;t News the Trea&s;urer heard, after Both
<MILESTONE N="10">their Maje&s;ties had the Day before &s;aid all to him that He could de&s;ire,
was, that the Place was already full; which He received with more Com|motion
than was natural to him, and looked upon it as a de&s;igned, con|trived
Affront to expo&s;e him to Contempt. &startq;Why would not the King,
if He had changed his Mind after He left him, fir&s;t &s;end him Word of it,
that He might have known his Purpo&s;e?&endq;</P>
<P>ALL this Storm fell pre&s;ently upon the Chancellor: The Lord <HI>Crofts</HI> a&s;|&s;ured
him, &startq;that it had been done at <HI>Salisbury</HI> if He had not hindered it;
that He had been with the Duke before He &s;pake with the King, and
given him Advice what Tune He &s;hould &s;peak in, which was u&s;ed ac|cordingly
<MILESTONE N="20">and had prevailed; and that when He came into the Duke's
Chamber to ki&s;s his Hand, his Highne&s;s turned away and would not
&s;peak to him, which mu&s;t proceed from the Influence of the Chan|cellor.&endq;
Whereas in Truth the Chancellor had only &s;een the Duke
in publick, and &s;aid no more to him than what He &s;aid in publick,
thinking it no good Manners to trouble him with any private Di&s;cour&s;e,
when He was &s;o weary of his Journey; nor did He know that any Thing
was done in that Affair till the Day after it was done, and after it was
known to the Trea&s;urer. Upon the whole Matter, how unwilling &s;oever
He was to believe that He could be &s;o gro&s;&s;ly faulty to him, when He
<MILESTONE N="30">&s;aw the Chancellor next his Countenance was not the &s;ame it u&s;ed to be;
which the other taking Notice of a&s;ked him, according to his u&s;ual Fami|liarity,
&startq;what the Matter was,&endq; but received &s;uch an An&s;wer as made him
di&s;cern that there was Somewhat ami&s;s: And &s;o He &s;aid no more. The
other being the &s;ame Day with the King, the Duke came into the Room,
and in his Looks manife&s;ted a Di&s;plea&s;ure towards the Trea&s;urer, which
confirmed the former Jealou&s;y of the Chancellor; which was improved by
the Ladies, who did not like their Lodging, and thought it proceeded from
Want of Friend&s;hip in him, who had the Power over the Univer&s;ity, and
might have a&s;&s;igned what Lodgings He plea&s;ed to the Trea&s;urer; and He
<MILESTONE N="40">had a&s;&s;igned this, as the be&s;t Hou&s;e in the Town for &s;o great a Family, and
which their own Servant had de&s;ired as the be&s;t in the Town, as it was.</P>
<P>WHEN the Chancellor di&s;covered the Ground of this Alteration, He grew
out of Humour too, and thought him&s;elf unworthily &s;u&s;pected: And &s;o for
two or three Days the two Friends came not together. And in that Time
the Chancellor had enough to do to inform the Duke, who was not only
very much offended with the Trea&s;urer, but thought that He had been,
out of his Friend&s;hip to the Trea&s;urer, more remi&s;s than He ought to have
been in a Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o earne&s;tly recommended by him and his Wife; and the
Intelligence from <HI>Salisbury</HI> had made Reflections upon him as much as upon
<MILESTONE N="50">the other. But his Royal Highne&s;s willingly received Information of all that
had pa&s;&s;ed, and di&s;cerned the foul Carriage of others as well as of the Lord
<HI>Crofts;</HI> and was plea&s;ed to confe&s;s, &startq;that He had done all He ought to do,
&startq;and that He had been mi&s;informed of the Lord Trea&s;urer's Part in that Affair,
<PB N="296" REF="300">
which had made him think ami&s;s of him, which He would acknowledge
to him next Time He &s;aw him.&endq;</P>
<P>AFTER this the Chancellor, having a more clear View, upon Conference
with the King-and the Duke, of this pernicious De&s;ign, which in &s;ome De|gree
had compa&s;&s;ed its End if there grew a Strangene&s;s between the Trea|&s;urer
and him, went to him: And They being together without any others,
He told him, &startq;it &s;hould not be in his Power to break Friend&s;hip with him to
gratify the Humour of other People, without letting him know what the
Matter was,&endq; which He conjured him to impart to him; a&s;&s;uring him,
that He would find that Nothing was more impo&s;&s;ible than that He could<MILESTONE N="10">
commit a Fault towards him, and that They who wi&s;hed well to neither
of them had contrived this Separation as the be&s;t Way to hurt them Both.&endq;
And when He &s;aw that He did not yet open him&s;elf, He told him, &startq;that
He had heard that He had received &s;ome Umbrage in the Pretence of his
Nephew, and therefore He would give him an Account of all that He
knew of it,&endq; which He did exactly; and concluded with a Prote&s;tation,
that He had not known what had been done at <HI>Oxford</HI> till after He
came from him, when He ob&s;erved the Change of his Countenance to|wards
him, of the Cau&s;e of which He could not then make any Con|jecture.&endq;<MILESTONE N="20"></P>
<P>THE Trea&s;urer thereupon with his u&s;ual Freedom told him, &startq;that if his
Part had been no other than as He related, He thought him&s;elf obliged
to give him a Narration of all He had done, and of the Grounds and
Motives He had to think that He had failed in his Friend&s;hip.&endq; And
thereupon He mentioned &startq;the Kindne&s;s and E&s;teem He had for his Nephew,
whom He thought in all Re&s;pects of Birth and Breeding at lea&s;t as worthy
of that Relation as the Gentleman who was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it; and yet that
&s;ince He was not upon the Place, He had no Mind to engage him&s;elf in
the Suit: And that when his Nephew had given him an Account what the
Chancellor had &s;aid to him,&endq; which He did with great Ingenuity, &startq;and<MILESTONE N="30">
He knew that the Duke of <HI>York</HI> appeared in it for another, He re&s;olved
to pro&s;ecute it no farther; until the Lord <HI>Crofts</HI> with all Confidence a&s;|&s;ured
him, <HI>that the King had promi&s;ed him to confer the Place upon</HI> Robert
Spencer, <HI>and that Both their Maje&s;ties expected that He &s;hould make it his
Suit, to the End that They might thereby decline the Importunity that He
expected from his Brother.&endq;</HI> He told him of &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions He had
u&s;ed to the King in that Affair, which the King him&s;elf had reported; and
that when He took his Leave of the Queen to go to <HI>Oxford</HI>&endq; (which was
the next Day after Mr. <HI>Mountague</HI> came from <HI>York</HI>), &startq;He di&s;&s;uaded her
Maje&s;ty from receiving Mr. <HI>Spencer,</HI> alleging &s;ome Rea&s;ons again&s;t it,<MILESTONE N="40">
which a Lady who was near overheard, and informed the Per&s;on of it who
acquainted him with it: All which, with the King's and Queen's &s;o ample
Promi&s;es to him &s;o few Hours before the conferring the Place upon ano|ther,
and the Duke of <HI>York's</HI> Manner of receiving him after He had
been &s;hut up with him, as He was informed, might very well excu&s;e
him for thinking He had &s;ome Share in the Affront He had undergone.&endq;</P>
<P>To which the other replied, &startq;that if indeed He did believe all that He
had been told, He could not but think &s;o; but,&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;He thought
He had known him better than to give Credit to &s;uch Reports, which
mu&s;t make him a Fool and a Knave: That for the Words He &s;hould<MILESTONE N="50">
have u&s;ed to the King or the Queen, there had Nothing pa&s;&s;ed like it to
either of them, but that they were purely devi&s;ed out of Malice; which
&s;hould be manife&s;t unto him, for He would not &s;peak a Word of it to
<PB N="297" REF="301">
the King till They were Both with him together, and then He would a&s;k
before him what his Carriage had been, and by his Maje&s;ty's &s;udden An|&s;wer
He might judge of the Report.&endq; He told him then, &startq;how much
He had &s;uffered with the Duke, and what excellent Stories had been made
to his Royal Highne&s;s of Both of them, and of the good Part the Lord
<HI>Crofts</HI> had acted, of which He was not without &s;ome Evidence.&endq; After
this <HI>Eclairci&s;&s;ement,</HI> of the Sincerity whereof every Day admini&s;tered new Te&s;ti|mony,
They Both returned to their mutual Confidence in each other: And
They who had contrived this former Device entered into a new Confederacy,
<MILESTONE N="10">how They might fir&s;t remove the Trea&s;urer, which would facilitate the
pulling the Chancellor down; of which anon.</P>
<P>WITHIN a &s;hort Time after the Duke returned out of <HI>York&s;hire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke con&s;ults the Chancellor about making two Suits to the King.</NOTE> his
Highne&s;s told the Chancellor in Confidence, &startq;that He had two Suits which
He intended to make to the King, and with which He fir&s;t acquainted him
that He might have his A&s;&s;i&s;tance in the obtaining them. The fir&s;t was,
in which He and his Wife were equally engaged, to prevail with the
King to make Sir <HI>George Savile</HI> a Vi&s;count.&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;He knew well
the Re&s;olution the King had taken, to which He had contributed his Ad|vice,
to make no more Lords: But that He hoped in this particular Ca&s;e
<MILESTONE N="20">his Maje&s;ty would upon his De&s;ire di&s;pen&s;e with a general Rule. That
Sir <HI>George</HI> had one of the be&s;t Fortunes of any Man in <HI>England,</HI> and
lived the mo&s;t like a great Man; that He had been very civil to him and
his Wife in the <HI>North,</HI> and treated them at his Hou&s;e in a very &s;pendid
Manner; and that He was engaged to prevail with the King in this
Point, or to confe&s;s He had no Power, which He hoped He &s;hould not
be without in this Matter;&endq; and a&s;ked his Opinion.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor in his u&s;ual Freedom, which He always took when
He was to deliver his Advice to the King or Duke, &s;aid &startq;that He could
not advi&s;e his Highne&s;s to move the King in it; for be&s;ides that He
<MILESTONE N="30">knew the King's po&s;itive Determination, the Departure from which might
be of ill Con&s;equence, Sir <HI>George Savile</HI> was a Man of a very ill Repu|tation
among&s;t Men of Piety and Religion, and was looked upon as void
of all Sen&s;e of Religion, even to the doubting if not denying that there
is a God, and that He was not re&s;erved in any Company to publi&s;h his
Opinions: Which made him believe that it would neither be for his
Highne&s;s's Honour to propo&s;e it, nor for the King's to grant it, in a Time
when all Licen&s;e in Di&s;cour&s;e and in Actions was &s;pread over the King|dom,
to the Heart-breaking of very many good Men, who had terrible
Apprehen&s;ions of the Con&s;equence of it.&endq; The Duke was not at all
<MILESTONE N="40">plea&s;ed with his Di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;aid, &startq;He was re&s;olved to u&s;e all his Cre|dit
with the King to compa&s;s it, and that He hoped that whatever He
thought He would not oppo&s;e it.&endq;</P>
<P>THE other Particular was, &startq;that He would move the King to make
Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> his Secretary a Privy Coun&s;ellor,&endq; and a&s;ked him &startq;what He
thought of that.&endq; To which He an&s;wered, &startq;that his Opinion in that
Point would plea&s;e him no better than in the former. That He did not
think it fit to be a&s;ked: And if the King his Brother were inclined
to be jealous of him, as &s;ome had endeavoured to per&s;uade him, &s;uch an
In&s;tance as this would very much confirm it; for never any Prince of
<MILESTONE N="50"><HI>Wales</HI> had a Servant of the highe&s;t Degree about him called to the Coun|cil,
till his Father called the Earl of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> who was the Prince's Go|vernour,
to the Board, which was not till upon the Approach of the Trou|bles
He di&s;cerned that He &s;hould employ him in another Charge. That the
<PB N="298" REF="302">
Members of that Board had been always tho&s;e great Officers of State,
and other Officers, who in Re&s;pect of the Places They held had a Title
to &s;it there, and of &s;uch few others who, having great Titles and For|tunes
and Intere&s;t in the Kingdom, were an Ornament to the Table.
That there were at pre&s;ent too many already, and the Number le&s;&s;ened
the Dignity of the Relation: That his Highne&s;s had already brought the
Lord <HI>Berkley</HI> thither, who had no Manner of Title to be there but his De|pendance
upon him; and now to bring in his Secretary, for no other Rea&s;on
but for being his Secretary, might be thought an Encroachment, and be
mi&s;interpreted by the King.&endq; He added, &startq;that his wrangling, litigious Na|ture<MILESTONE N="10">
would give the Board much Trouble; and that He knew him to be
&s;o much his particular Enemy, that He would watch all the Opportunities
to do him all po&s;&s;ible ill Offices to the King and to his Royal Highne&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Duke replied only to the la&s;t, and &s;aid, &startq;He perceived Somebody
had done <HI>Will. Coventry</HI> ill Offices, which He knew to be unju&s;t and
fal&s;e: And that He could a&s;&s;ure him upon his own Knowledge, that He
had a great Re&s;pect for him, and de&s;ired his Favour; and that He would
pa&s;s his Word for him, that He would never do any Thing to di&s;&s;erve
him, which if He &s;hould do He &s;hould for ever lo&s;e his Favour, which
He knew well.&endq; And no Doubt the Duke did believe all He &s;aid, for<MILESTONE N="20">
He had a perfect Kindne&s;s for the Chancellor; and when He did not com|ply
with what He wi&s;hed, He knew that it was out of the Integrity of his
Judgment, and his &s;trict Duty to the King and him&s;elf, and that He had
never flattered or di&s;&s;embled with either of them. And Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> had
Skill enough to per&s;uade him to believe what He de&s;ired &s;hould be true,
though there were in the View of all Men frequent In&s;tances of the con|trary,
and of the Ab&s;ence of all Ingenuity and Sincerity in his Actions.</P>
<P>WITHIN very few Days after this Conference,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Duke moves the King to make Sir</HI> George Sa|vile <HI>a Vi&s;|count.</HI></NOTE> and when the Dutche&s;s
had made new In&s;tance with her Father in the Ca&s;e of Sir <HI>George Savile,</HI>
and with more Importunity than the Duke, and appeared more concerned<MILESTONE N="30">
and troubled that He &s;hould not be more forward to comply with the
Duke's De&s;ires (but the Chancellor, who always with the Re&s;pect that was
due to her Quality pre&s;erved the Dignity of a Father very entire, would
give no other An&s;wer than He had done to the Duke, and advi&s;ed her to
di&s;&s;uade him from making the Reque&s;t to the King); his Highne&s;s one
Day de&s;ired the King that He would retire into his Clo&s;et, and call the
Chancellor to him: And when They three were together in the Room,
after a &s;hort Di&s;cour&s;e of Letters which He had received from the Earl of
<HI>Sandwich,</HI> which there will be Occa&s;ion anon to mention at large, the
Duke told the King, &startq;He had an humble Suit to his Maje&s;ty;&endq; and then<MILESTONE N="40">
&s;pake much of the great Intere&s;t that Sir <HI>George Savile</HI> had in the Northern
Parts, of the Greatne&s;s of his E&s;tate, and his orderly and &s;plendid Way of
Living, and concluded with his De&s;ire &startq;that his Maje&s;ty would make him
an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Vi&s;count.&endq; Upon which the King pre&s;ently put him in Mind
of the Re&s;olution He had formerly made in that Room, and He thought
upon his own Motion, but He was &s;ure it had been with his Concur|rence
and Approbation.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Duke replied, &startq;that He remembered it very well, and thought He
&s;hould do well &s;till in the general to ob&s;erve it: Yet it was in tho&s;e Ca&s;es
always &s;uppo&s;ed, that an extraordinary Ca&s;e might fall out, that might<MILESTONE N="50">
produce an Exception; and He did mo&s;t humbly be&s;eech his Maje&s;ty,
that He would upon his very earne&s;t Interpo&s;ition, from which Nobody
could make a Precedent, di&s;pen&s;e with the Rule.&endq; He did con&s;e&s;s, &startq;that
<PB N="299" REF="303">
He was &s;o confident of his Maje&s;ty's Favour, that He had given Sir
<HI>George Savile</HI> Cau&s;e to believe that He would prevail in that Suit; which
if He &s;hould not do, He mu&s;t be thought either not to have intended
what He promi&s;ed, or to have no Credit with his Maje&s;ty, neither of
which would be for his Honour.&endq;</P>
<P>THE King replied roundly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which the King will not con&s;ent to.</NOTE> and with more Pre&s;ence of Mind than He had
always about him, &startq;that it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be very preci&s;e in the
Ob&s;ervation of the Rule, which if He &s;hould once break, a World of In|conveniences
would break in upon him, which He could not defend
<MILESTONE N="10">him&s;elf again&s;t.&endq; He named two or three Per&s;ons who were very &s;oli|citous
for Honours, and had &s;everal Pretences to it; and his Maje&s;ty had
only been able to re&s;i&s;t and evade their Importunity, by objecting this de|clared
Re&s;olution to them. The plain Truth is; He had made &s;ome Pro|mi&s;e
(a Weakne&s;s He was too often liable to) to tho&s;e Per&s;ons or to their
Friends, &startq;that when He &s;hould make any new Creations They &s;hould be
&s;ure to be in the Number:&endq; Nor did He apprehend any Inconvenience
from redeeming him&s;elf from the pre&s;ent Importunity, which was &s;till
grievous to him, &s;ince He had re&s;olved to make no new Creation. And
this was the true Rea&s;on that made him now &s;o inexorable to his Brother,
<MILESTONE N="20">who was very much troubled, and declined to move any Thing el&s;e in &s;o
unlucky a Sea&s;on, not without &s;ome Apprehen&s;ion, from the King's quicker
Way of Di&s;cour&s;e, that He had been prepared for it by the Chancellor, who
though pre&s;ent had not &s;poke one Word in the Debate, nor indeed ever in|formed
the King of the Conference his Highne&s;s had formerly held with
him upon that Subject, nor ever &s;poken to him concerning it.</P>
<P>HOWEVER in this Perplexity as the Duke thought it nece&s;&s;ary to inform
Mr. <HI>Coventry,</HI> who had principally advanced this Pretence, all that had
pa&s;&s;ed before the King, that his Nephew (for &s;o Sir <HI>George Savile</HI> was) might
&s;ee He could make no farther Progre&s;s in it; &s;o in the Pa&s;&s;ion He un|warily
<MILESTONE N="30">told him all that had pa&s;&s;ed in the former Conference with the
Chancellor, which He took Care &s;hould not be concealed from any who
were like to be willing to revenge it. And the Duke, to &s;hew how wil|ling
He was to oblige the Family, immediately received a younger Brother
of Sir <HI>George Savile,</HI> whom He had only &s;een in the <HI>North,</HI> to wait upon
him in his Bedchamber; who being a young Man of Wit, and incredible
Confidence and Pre&s;umption, omitted no Occa&s;ion to vent his Malice
again&s;t the Chancellor, with a Licen&s;e that in former Times would have
been very penal, though it had concerned a Per&s;on of a much inferiour
Quality in the State.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40">WITHIN a &s;hort Time after, the King told the Chancellor,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> William Coventry <HI>ad|mitted of the Privy Council and the pri|vate Commit|tee.</HI></NOTE> &startq;that his
Brother had de&s;ired him that his Secretary Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> might be ad|mitted
of the Privy Council, which He could not deny, but had pro|mi&s;ed
it &s;hould be done at the next Meeting;&endq; which was accordingly
done, and He knighted: And quickly after, upon the like De&s;ire of the
Duke, He was called to that Committee with which his Maje&s;ty u&s;ed to
con&s;ult his mo&s;t &s;ecret Affairs. And from this Time there was an Alteration
in the whole Carriage and Debate of all Manner of Bu&s;ine&s;s: And as the
Chancellor had found his own Credit with the King much dimini&s;hed from
the Time of the Lord <HI>Arlington's</HI> being Secretary; &s;o a greater Decrea&s;e of
<MILESTONE N="50">it was now vi&s;ible to all Men from the Acce&s;s of this new Coun&s;ellor.</P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> had not the Gift of &s;peaking nor of a quick Concep|tion,
and &s;o rarely contradicted any Thing in Council: His Talent was in
private, where He frequently procured, very inconveniently, Changes and
<PB N="300" REF="304">
Alterations from publick Determinations. But Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> (be|tween
whom and the other there was an entire Conjunction and Combina|tion)
was a Man of quick Parts and a ready Speaker, unre&s;trained by any
Mode&s;ty or Submi&s;&s;ion to the Age, Experience or Dignity of other Men,
equally cen&s;orious of what had been done before He was a Coun&s;ellor, as
&s;olicitous in Contradiction of what&s;oever was propo&s;ed afterwards: In&s;omuch
as the very fir&s;t Time that He was admitted to the private Committee, the
Debate being about providing Money to be paid at a Day approaching to
the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> according to the King's Obligation, He &s;aid, &startq;We
had Need enough of Money for our own immediate Occa&s;ions; and<MILESTONE N="10">
that We ought not to a&s;&s;ign any to the Advancement of the Affairs of
other Men.&endq; Whereupon He was informed &startq;of the Treaty the King
had entered into, and that the Bi&s;hop was at that Time upon his March,
which was by every Body looked upon as of great Importance to his Ma|je&s;ty:&endq;
To which He an&s;wered, &startq;that He had heard Somewhat of it how
&s;ecretly &s;oever it had been carried, and that He had never liked it from
the Beginning, nor would give his Con&s;ent that any more Money &s;hould
be paid towards it;&endq; which the King him&s;elf looked upon as a rare
Impudence.</P>
<P>HIS great Ambition was to be taken Notice of for oppo&s;ing and con|tradicting<MILESTONE N="20">
what&s;oever was propo&s;ed or &s;aid by the Chancellor or Trea&s;urer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Where He con&s;tantly op|po&s;es the Chan|cellor and Trea&s;urer.</NOTE>
towards whom all other Coun&s;ellors, how little &s;oever They cared for their
Per&s;ons, had ever paid Re&s;pect in Regard of their Offices. He was a de|clared
Enemy to all Lawyers, and to the Law it&s;elf; and any Thing pa&s;&s;ed
under the great Seal of <HI>England</HI> was of no more Authority with him, than
if it were the Scroll of a Scrivener. He had no Principles in Religion or
State, of one Mind this Day and another To-morrow, and always very un|ea&s;y
to tho&s;e who were obliged to con&s;ult with him; who&s;e Pride and In|&s;olence
will admini&s;ter frequent Occa&s;ions of Mention throughout the en|&s;uing
Relation.<MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>THE King had not been many Days in <HI>Oxford,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Succe&s;s of the Fleet after the Attempt at</HI> Bergen.</NOTE> when News arrived that
the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> had been engaged in &s;ome Conflict with the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Fleet; of the Particulars whereof there was a general Longing to be adver|ti&s;ed.
The Truth was, that whil&s;t the Earl rode, after the Bu&s;ine&s;s of
<HI>Bergen,</HI> as near that Coa&s;t as was &s;afe, in Expectation of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet,
the Winds, which are always tempe&s;tuous in that Sea&s;on of the Year, <HI>Sep|tember,</HI>
made it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for him to remove with his whole Fleet
to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Scotland,</HI> where there were Harbours enough for him to
ride &s;afe; and in this Interval of Time <HI>De Ruyter</HI> was pa&s;&s;ed by towards
that of <HI>Norway.</HI> The News of their <HI>Indian</HI> Fleet having been attacked by<MILESTONE N="40">
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in <HI>Bergen,</HI> and the Letters of &s;ome of their Officers, which
implied as if They were not &s;atisfied in the Security of the Port and of the
Fidelity of the Governour, produced a wonderful Con&s;ternation in <HI>Holland;</HI>
and if They &s;hould be deprived of that Wealth, the very Company of the
<HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> would be in Danger of being di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>THE Fleet was ready to &s;et Sail under the Command of <HI>De Ruyter</HI> well
fitted and manned: But there were &s;till many Factions among&s;t the Cap|tains
and other Officers, that might upon any Accidents produce many Mi&s;|chiefs;
for the better Prevention whereof, the Pen&s;ionary <HI>De Wit</HI> was wil|ling
to venture his own Per&s;on, believing him&s;elf to be as &s;ecure any<MILESTONE N="50">
where as on Shore, if any Misfortune &s;hould befall the Fleet. And &s;o He
was by a &s;pecial Commi&s;&s;ion made Plenipotentiary, with an ample Allow|ance
for his Table, and a Guard of Halberdiers for the Safety of his Per|&s;on,
<PB N="301" REF="305">
with a good Train of Volunteers: And &s;o He put him&s;elf on Board the
Ship of <HI>De Ruyter,</HI> who received Orders from him.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lord</HI> Sand|wich <HI>not able to come to an Engagement with</HI> De Ruyter.</NOTE> after He had received Adverti&s;ements of the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet's being pa&s;&s;ed by for <HI>Norway,</HI> took all the Care He could to
put him&s;elf and his Fleet in the Way of their Return. They made a &s;hort
Stay on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Norway,</HI> where upon good Con&s;ideration their Ships
were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and loud Clamour rai&s;ed again&s;t the Ho&s;tility of the <HI>En|gli&s;h.</HI>
And notwith&s;tanding all the Vigilance the Earl could u&s;e, the Dark|ne&s;s
and Length of the Nights &s;o favoured them, that He could not en|gage
<MILESTONE N="10">their whole Fleet as He endeavoured to do: Yet He had the good
Fortune in two Encounters to take eight of their great Ships of War,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But takes ma|ny of his Ships in their Flight.</NOTE> two of
their be&s;t <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Ships, and about twenty of their other Merchant-Ships,
which were all under the Protection of their Fleet, or ought to have been.
After which He was by Tempe&s;t driven to put the Fleet into Security in the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Harbours, it being already the Month of <HI>October.</HI></P>
<P>IT was a fair Booty, and came very opportunely to &s;upply the pre&s;ent
Nece&s;&s;ities of the Navy, and to provide for the &s;etting out of the next Fleet
at Spring, and was in Truth gotten with very good Conduct, and without
any con&s;iderable Damage: But it being much le&s;s than was expected (for
<MILESTONE N="20">what&s;oever was upon the Sea was looked upon as our own), the News no
&s;ooner arrived at <HI>Oxford,</HI> but Intelligence came with it of many Over&s;ights
which had been committed and Opportunities lo&s;t, otherwi&s;e it had been
ea&s;y to have taken the whole Fleet; and that it might have been pur&s;ued
farther when it was in View, after tho&s;e <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Ships were taken, which
were indeed &s;urpri&s;ed and boarded at the Break of Day, when They thought
them&s;elves in the Middle of their own Fleet. And it is as true that the
Earl did then pur&s;ue to engage the Fleet, till They were got &s;o near the
<HI>French</HI> Shore, that the Wind blowing in to the Land, it was by all the
Flag-Officers thought ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to give over the Chace.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30">SIR <HI>William Coventry,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sir</HI> W. Co|ventry's <HI>un|ju&s;t Reflec|tions upon him.</HI></NOTE> who had never paid a Civility to any worthy Man
but as it was a Di&s;obligation to another whom He cared le&s;s for, and &s;o
had only contributed to the Preferment of the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> in the la&s;t
Expedition that He might cro&s;s Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> received much Intelligence
from &s;everal Officers in the Fleet, which He &s;cattered abroad to the Preju|dice
of the Earl, and was willing that it &s;hould be believed that He had
been too wary in avoiding Danger. But the King and the Duke were very
ju&s;t to the Earl, and di&s;countenanced all tho&s;e Reports as Scandals and
Calumnies: And the Duke, who had &s;een his Behaviour in the mo&s;t dan|gerous
Action, gave him a loud Te&s;timony &startq;of a prudent and brave Com|mander,
<MILESTONE N="40">and as forward and bold in the Face of Danger as the Occa&s;ion
required or Di&s;cretion permitted.&endq; And his Highne&s;s undertook &startq;that
He had in all this Expedition done what a Man of Honour was obliged to
do,&endq; and was abundantly &s;atisfied (as his Maje&s;ty likewi&s;e was) with the
rich Prizes He had brought home, which had cau&s;ed equal Lamentation in
<HI>Holland,</HI> and almo&s;t broke the Heart of <HI>De Wit</HI> him&s;elf. But what Suc|ce&s;s
&s;oever the Earl had at Sea, it was his Misfortune to do an unadvi&s;ed
Action when He came into the Harbour, that le&s;&s;ened the King's own E&s;|teem
of him, and to a great Degree irreconciled the Duke to him, and
gave Opportunity to his Enemies to do him much Prejudice.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50">IT was a con&s;tant and a known Rule in the Admiralty,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An imprud$$$ Action of the Earl of</HI> Sand|wich <HI>after his Return.</HI></NOTE> that of any
Ship that is taken from the Enemy Bulk is not to be broken, till it be
brought into the Port and adjudged lawful Prize. It &s;eems that when the
Fleet returned to the Harbour, the Flag-Officers petitioned or moved the
<PB N="302" REF="306">
Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> &startq;in Regard of their having continued all the Summer
upon the Seas with great Fatigue, and been engaged in many Actions of
Danger, that He would di&s;tribute among&s;t them &s;ome Reward out of the
<HI>Indian</HI> Ships;&endq; which He thought rea&s;onable, and inclined to &s;atisfy them,
and writ a Letter to the Vice-Chamberlain to inform the King of it, and
that He thought it fit to be done;&endq; to which the Vice-Chamberlain, having
&s;hewed the Letter to the King, returned his Maje&s;ty's Approbation. But
before the An&s;wer came to his Hand He had executed the De&s;ign, and di|&s;tributed
as much of the coar&s;er Goods to the Flag-Officers, as by E&s;tima|tion
was valued to be one thou&s;and Pounds to each Officer, and took to the<MILESTONE N="10">
Value of two thou&s;and Pounds for him&s;elf. This &s;uddenly made &s;uch a
Noi&s;e and Outcry, as if all the <HI>Indian</HI> and other Merchant-Ships had been
plundered by the Seamen: And They again cried out as much, that no
Care was taken of them, but all given to the Flag-Officers; which the other
Captains thought to be an Injury to them.</P>
<P>THE General (who had Nothing like Kindne&s;s for the Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Which the General re|pre&s;ents in the wor&s;t Light.</NOTE>
who&s;e Service He thought had been too much con&s;idered and recompen&s;ed
by the King at his Arrival) had Notice of it before it came to <HI>Oxford;</HI> and
according to his univer&s;al Care (which was afterwards found to proceed
from private Animo&s;ity) &s;ent Orders to all the Port Towns to &s;eize upon<MILESTONE N="20">
Goods which were brought in Shallops from the Fleet; and gave Adver|ti&s;ement
to <HI>Oxford</HI> of the extraordinary ill Con&s;equence of that Action,
and &startq;that it would &s;poil the Sale of all that remained of tho&s;e Ships,
&s;ince the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, which probably would have been the be&s;t
Chapmen, would not now be forward to buy, &s;ince &s;o much was di&s;po&s;ed
of already to other Hands as would &s;poil their Market.&endq; And by this
Time the Earl him&s;elf had given an Account of all that had been done,
and the Motives,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of|fended with the Earl.</NOTE> to the Duke. The King was ju&s;tly di&s;plea&s;ed for the
Expedition He had u&s;ed, &startq;why had his Approbation been de&s;ired, when
He re&s;olved to do the Thing before He could receive an An&s;wer?&endq; yet<MILESTONE N="30">
was glad that He had done &s;o, becau&s;e He would have been more excu&s;e|able
if He had received it.</P>
<P>BUT the Duke, who had been con&s;tantly kind to the Earl, was offended
in the highe&s;t Degree,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke in|cen&s;ed again&s;t him.</NOTE> and thought him&s;elf injured and affronted beyond
any Precedent. &startq;This mo&s;t unju&s;tifiable Action could proceed only from
two Fountains: The one of extreme Vanity and Ambition, to make
him&s;elf popular among&s;t the Officers of the Fleet, who ought not to have
been gratified by him at the King's Charge. When any &s;uch Bounty &s;hould
be &s;ea&s;onable, it was the Duke's Province to have been the Author, and the
Conduit to have conveyed it: He had him&s;elf been an Eyewitne&s;s of their<MILESTONE N="40">
Behaviour in the greate&s;t Action; and for the Earl to a&s;&s;ume the reward|ing
them by his own Authority was to defraud and rob him of his proper
Right and Juri&s;diction.&endq; And He looked upon his having de&s;ired the
King's Allowance by the Vice-Chamberlain, as a Trick and an Aggrava|tion;
for He ought to have a&s;ked his Advice as his &s;uperiour Officer; And
the poor Vice-Chamberlain underwent his Share in the Reproach, for having
pre&s;umed to move the King in a Particular that, if it was to be moved at
all, had been to be moved by the Duke. &startq;The other Fountain which might
produce this Pre&s;umption might be Avarice,&endq; which was the &s;ole Blemi&s;h
(though it never appeared in any gro&s;s In&s;tance) that &s;eemed to cloud many<MILESTONE N="50">
noble Virtues in that Earl, who now became a very pregnant Evidence of
the irre&s;i&s;tible Strength and Power of Envy; which though it feeds on its
own Poi&s;on, and is naturally more grievous to the Per&s;on who harbours it
<PB N="303" REF="307">
than to him that is maligned, yet when it finds a Subject it can effectually
work upon, it is more in&s;atiable in Revenge than any Pa&s;&s;ion the Soul is
liable unto.</P>
<P>HE was a Gentleman of &s;o excellent a Temper and Behaviour that He
could make him&s;elf no Enemies; of &s;o many good Qualities,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Character of the Earl of</HI> Sandwich.</NOTE> and &s;o ea&s;y
to live with, that He marvellou&s;ly reconciled the Minds of all Men to him,
who had not Intimacy enough with him to admire his other Parts: Yet
was in the general Inclinations of Men upon &s;ome Di&s;advantage. They
who had con&s;tantly followed the King whil&s;t He as con&s;tantly adhered to
<MILESTONE N="10"><HI>Cromwell,</HI> and knew not how early He had entertained Repentance, and
with what Hazards and Dangers He had manife&s;ted it, did believe the
King had been too prodigal in heaping &s;o many Honours upon him.
And They who had been familiar with him and of the &s;ame Party, and
thought They had been as active as He in contributing to the Revolution,
con&s;idered him with &s;ome Anger, as one who had better Luck than They
without more Merit, and who had made early Conditions: When in Truth
no Man in the Kingdom had been le&s;s guilty of that Addre&s;s; nor did He
ever contribute to any Advancement to which He arrived, by the lea&s;t In|timation
or In&s;inuation that He wi&s;hed it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is very injuriou&s;ly treated.</NOTE> or that it would be acceptable
<MILESTONE N="20">to him. Yet upon this Bla&s;t the Winds ro&s;e from all Quarters, Reproaches
of all Sorts were ca&s;t upon him, and all Affronts contrived for him.</P>
<P>THE Earl had conveyed that Part of the Goods which He had a&s;|&s;igned
to him&s;elf in a Shallop to <HI>Lynn,</HI> from whence it could pa&s;s by
Water to his own Hou&s;e. An Officer in that Port &s;eized upon it by
Virtue of the General's Warrant, and would cau&s;e it pre&s;ently to be unladen,
which He began to do. But the Servants of the Earl appealed to the other
Officers in equal Authority, to whom They brought a Letter with them
from the Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> in which He owned all tho&s;e Goods to be his
(among&s;t which were his Bedding and Furniture for his Cabin, and all his
<MILESTONE N="30">Plate and other Things &s;uitable), and likewi&s;e a Note of all the other
Goods which might be liable to pay Cu&s;tom; and de&s;ired them &startq;to &s;end one
of their Searchers with the Boat to his Hou&s;e, where He &s;hould receive all
their Dues, without being unladen in the Port;&endq; which, be&s;ides the De|lay,
would be liable to many Inconveniences. The Officer who had fir&s;t
arre&s;ted it, and who had Dependance upon a great Man of the Country,
who was not unwilling that any Affront &s;hould be put upon the Earl,
roughly refu&s;ed to &s;uffer it to pa&s;s without being fir&s;t unladen; but being
over-ruled by the other Officers, vented his Anger in very unmannerly
Language again&s;t the Earl: Of all which He, being adverti&s;ed by his Ser|vants,
<MILESTONE N="40">&s;ent a Complaint to the Lords of the Council, and de&s;ired &startq;the
Fellow might be &s;ent for and puni&s;hed;&endq; which could not be refu&s;ed,
though it proved trouble&s;ome in the Inquiry. For the Officer, who was
a Gentleman of a fair Behaviour and good Repute, denied all tho&s;e Words
which carried in them the wor&s;t Interpretation; but ju&s;tified the Action,
and produced the General's Warrant, which had unu&s;ual Expre&s;&s;ions, and
apparent enough to have a particular and not a general Intention.</P>
<P>THE General had quick Adverti&s;ement of it, and writ very pa&s;&s;ionately
from <HI>London,</HI> &startq;that an Officer &s;hould be &s;ent for without having committed
any other Offence than in obeying and executing a Warrant of his:&endq; And
<MILESTONE N="50">the other great Man, who was of great Importance to the King's Service
and in the highe&s;t Tru&s;t in that Country, writ &s;everal Letters &startq;how impo&s;|&s;ible
it would be to carry on the King's Service in that Country, if that
Officer &s;hould be puni&s;hed for doing that, when He ought to be pu|ni&s;hed
<PB N="304" REF="308">
if He had not done it;&endq; and therefore de&s;ired, &startq;that He might
be repaired by them who had cau&s;ed him to be &s;ent for.&endq;</P>
<P>SIR <HI>William Coventry</HI> had now full Sea-Room to give Vent to all his
Pa&s;&s;ions, and to incen&s;e the Duke, who was enough offended without &s;uch
Contributions: &startq;If this proceeded from Covetou&s;ne&s;s, it was not probable
that it would be &s;atisfied with &s;o little; and therefore it was probable, that
though the Officers might not have received above the Value of one thou|&s;and
Pounds,&endq; which was a&s;&s;igned to each, &startq;yet him&s;elf would not be
contented with &s;o little as two thou&s;and; and They might therefore well
conceive that He had taken much more, which ought to be examined<MILESTONE N="10">
with the greate&s;t Strictne&s;s.&endq; There had been Nothing &s;aid before of
not taking Advantage enough upon the Enemy in all Occa&s;ions which had
been offered, and of not pur&s;uing them far enough, which was not now
renewed, with Advice &startq;that He might be pre&s;ently &s;ent for;&endq; though it
was known that, as &s;oon as He could put the Ships into the Ports to which
they were de&s;igned, He would come to <HI>Oxford.</HI> And there were great un|derhand
Endeavours, that the Hou&s;e of Commons might be inflamed with
this Mi&s;carriage and Mi&s;demeanor, and pre&s;ent it as a Complaint to the
Hou&s;e of Peers, as fit to be examined and brought to Judgment before that
Tribunal. And They, who with all the Malice imaginable did endeavour<MILESTONE N="20">
in vain to kindle this Fire, per&s;uaded the King and the Duke, &startq;that by
their &s;ole Activity and Intere&s;t it was prevented for that Time, becau&s;e
the Se&s;&s;ion was too &s;hort, and that all nece&s;&s;ary Evidence could not be
&s;oon produced at <HI>Oxford;</HI> but that, as &s;oon as the Plague &s;hould cea&s;e to
&s;uch a Degree in <HI>London</HI> that the Parliament might a&s;&s;emble there, it
would be impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;train the Hou&s;e of Commons from pur&s;uing
that Complaint,&endq; of which Nobody thought but them&s;elves and They
who were provoked by them.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> had &s;o good Intelligence from <HI>Oxford,</HI> that He
knew all that was &s;aid of him, and began to believe that He had done un|advi&s;edly<MILESTONE N="30">
in admini&s;tering Occa&s;ion of &s;peaking ill to tho&s;e who greedily
&s;ought for it: And as &s;oon as his Ab&s;ence from the Fleet could be di&s;pen&s;ed
with,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He fully clears him&s;elf of the Charge of Mi&s;conduct at Sea.</NOTE> He made Ha&s;te to <HI>Oxford,</HI> and gave &s;o full an Account of every
Day's Action, from the Time that He went to Sea to the Day of his Return,
and of his having never done any Thing of Importance, nor having left any
Thing undone, but with and by the Advice of the Council of War, upon
the Orders He had received, that both the King and the Duke could not
but ab&s;olve him from all the Imputations of Negligence or Inadvertency.</P>
<P>BUT for the breaking Bulk and the Circum&s;tances that attended it, They
declared They were un&s;atisfied.<NOTE PLACE="marg">And makes an ingenuous Ac|knowledgement of his Impru|dence.</NOTE> And He confe&s;&s;ed &startq;that He had been<MILESTONE N="40">
much to blame,&endq; and a&s;ked Pardon, and with &s;uch Excu&s;es as He thought
might in &s;ome Degree plead for him. He prote&s;ted, &startq;it &s;eemed to him to have
had &s;ome Nece&s;&s;ity: That the whole Fleet was in a general Indi&s;po&s;ition,
and complained that for all that Summer Action&endq; (which indeed had been
full of Merit) &startq;They had Nothing given to them, not without &s;ome mut|tering
that They would have Somewhat out of tho&s;e <HI>India</HI> Ships before
They would part with them; in&s;omuch as He had a real Apprehen&s;ion
that They had a Purpo&s;e to plunder them. And He &s;hould have feared
more, if He had not complied with the Flag-Officers Importunity: And
thereupon He con&s;ented that They &s;hould have each of them the Value of<MILESTONE N="50">
one thou&s;and Pounds, and which He was mo&s;t confident the Goods which
had been delivered to them did not exceed.&endq; He confe&s;&s;ed &startq;He had not
enough con&s;idered the Con&s;equence, and that They who had not re|ceived
<PB N="305" REF="309">
any Donative would be more di&s;plea&s;ed, than They who had it
were &s;atisfied with it; which He acknowledged was the Ca&s;e: That He
was heartily &s;orry for permitting any &s;uch Thing to be done, and more for
having aken any him&s;elf, and humbly a&s;ked Pardon for Both; and de&s;ired
that his own Part, which remained entire, might be re&s;tored to the Ship
from whence it had been taken, which He would cau&s;e to be done.&endq;</P>
<P>A MORE ingenuous Acknowledgement could not be made: And They
who could not but ob&s;erve many Per&s;ons every Day excu&s;ed for more
enormous Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, did hope that He, who had &s;o few Faults to an|&s;wer
<MILESTONE N="10">for,<NOTE PLACE="marg">With which the King is &s;atisfied.</NOTE> would have been ab&s;olved for that Tre&s;pa&s;s. And the King him|&s;elf
u&s;ed him very graciou&s;ly, and &s;o did the Duke; and He was &s;ent back
to the Fleet, to give Order for the &s;ending out a Winter-Guard and order|ing
all other maritime Affairs, and for the &s;ending up the <HI>Indian</HI> Ships into
the River, with great Care that none of the Seamen &s;hould go on Shore,
where the Plague &s;till raged little if at all le&s;s than it had done in the Sum|mer:
And &s;o He him&s;elf and mo&s;t other Men believed and were glad, that
an ill Bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;o well compo&s;ed. But Sir <HI>William</HI> did not intend that
it &s;hould end there.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Ea&s;t-In|dia <HI>Prizes &s;old for the Service of the War.</HI></NOTE> that mu&s;t admit no Interruption, was the rai&s;ing
<MILESTONE N="20">what Money might be to &s;upply the pre&s;ent Nece&s;&s;ities of the Fleet, to pay
the Seamen, and to make all Preparations to &s;et out the Fleet again&s;t
the Spring, when the <HI>French</HI> Ships would be infallibly ready to join with
the <HI>Dutch;</HI> and the Money that was given by the Parliament would not be
paid till long after; and the Affairs of the Bankers were in &s;uch Di&s;order
by the Death of Servants, and the Plague having been in &s;ome of their
Hou&s;es, that the u&s;ual Cour&s;e of advancing Moneys by A&s;&s;ignations could
not be depended upon. The General had written to the Lord Trea&s;urer,
&startq;that He thought that there could not be &s;o good Chapmen for tho&s;e Ships
as the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, &s;ome whereof had been with him to know the
<MILESTONE N="30">King's Plea&s;ure; and if Authority were granted to any Men to treat
upon that Affair, They would &s;end for Members enough of their Com|pany,
who were di&s;per&s;ed in the Country, to be pre&s;ent at a Court,
which would authori&s;e a Committee to treat and contract with them:&endq;
And He &s;aid, &startq;that He was confident that Half the Money would be paid
&startq;upon the making the Bargain.&endq; The King was no &s;ooner adverti&s;ed of
this Overture, than He &s;ent Sir <HI>George Carteret</HI> and Mr. <HI>A&s;hburnham</HI> to
<HI>London</HI> to confer with the General and to be advi&s;ed by him, and granted
Authority to them three to &s;ell tho&s;e two Prizes to tho&s;e who would give
mo&s;t. And They found no Overtures to be &s;o advantageous as tho&s;e which
<MILESTONE N="40">were made by that Company: And yet They made &s;o much U&s;e of the
Advantage of the Time, when all Men of notorious Wealth were out of the
Town, that They thought not fit to make any Agreement till They gave
the King an Account of the whole Tran&s;action, with their Opinions upon
Conference with other Men of Bu&s;ine&s;s; and to that Purpo&s;e the two
Per&s;ons who had been &s;ent to the General returned &s;afe to <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>IT hath been mentioned before, that it was thought a great Pre&s;umption
in any Body to pre&s;ume to interpo&s;e in the maritime Affairs, which was in|terpreted
to be an Inva&s;ion of the Duke's peculiar Province; and by this

falling very &s;everely upon the Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> which would be a very
great Di&s;honour to the King if He were at that Time in the Command
of the Fleet; and that there was no Way to pre&s;erve him&endq; (for that was
their Method when They had a Mind to ruin a Man, to pretend a great

Charge, which probably might pre&s;erve him from being further que&s;tioned
&s;ince it would be interpreted a Puni&s;hment inflicted on him by the King
for his Crime, and &s;o might &s;top him from being further pro&s;ecuted for<MILESTONE N="10">
the &s;ame Offence.&endq; To which They added, &startq;that it would be nece&s;|&s;ary
in another Re&s;pect; for that many of the Officers as well as com|mon
Seamen had opened their Mouths very wide again&s;t him, e&s;pecially
after it was generally known that the King and the Duke were offended
with him, and had not been at all re&s;erved in charging him with &s;everal
Reproaches: And that if the &s;ame Command were &s;till continued in him,
it could not be pre&s;umed that tho&s;e Men would ever put them&s;elves un|der

<P>THESE Arguments urged by Men who were not known, at lea&s;t by the

in Truth was but for his Conjunction with the other) his Friend, and to
wi&s;h him very well, prevailed upon the Judgments of Both of them; in|&s;omuch
as They re&s;olved to confer with the Chancellor, whom They knew
to be much the Earl's Friend.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King re|&s;olves to di&s;|mi&s;s him with Honour.</NOTE> And They Both expre&s;&s;ed &startq;very much
Kindne&s;s to and Confidence in the Affection and Integrity and Courage
of the Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> though He was to be blamed for his late Indi&s;|cretion,
and a Re&s;olution with their utmo&s;t Power to defend him from
undergoing any Di&s;grace by it: But that it would contribute mo&s;t to his
Pre&s;ervation, that He quitted the Employment, and that &s;ome other Per|&s;ons
&s;hould be &s;ent to command the next Fleet in the Spring. For if He<MILESTONE N="30">
&s;hould again go to Sea, and the Parliament &s;hould pre&s;s to have him &s;ent
for to an&s;wer what They had to object again&s;t him, his Maje&s;ty mu&s;t
either refu&s;e to con&s;ent to it, which would make a Breach with his Par|liament,
or by con&s;enting di&s;order his maritime Affairs to that Degree,
that the Enemy could not but take very great Advantage of it.&endq; There|fore
They commanded the Chancellor to confer with him and di&s;cour&s;e
the whole Matter to him, to a&s;&s;ure him &startq;of the King's and Duke's Fa|vour,
and that They were in this Particular moved only by their Tender|ne&s;s
to him; and that &s;ome Expedient &s;hould be fir&s;t found out to re|move
him with Honour, before any Notice &s;hould be taken of the Pur|po&s;e<MILESTONE N="40">
to remove him, and before any other Per&s;on &s;hould be deputed to
the Command; and that He him&s;elf &s;hould either propo&s;e the Expedient,
if any &s;uch occurred to him that would be grateful, or judge of any that
&s;hould be propo&s;ed to him.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Chancellor did pre&s;ume to declare,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel|lor again&s;t re+moving him.</NOTE> &startq;that He thought that They
were per&s;uaded to apprehend Somewhat that could not fall out. That
He would not take upon him to excu&s;e the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> for any Of|fence
He had committed: If it were of that Magnitude that his Maje&s;ty
thought fit to remove him from his Command, Nobody could cen&s;ure it;
and it may be in a Time of &s;o much Licen&s;e the Severity might be<MILESTONE N="50">
thought &s;ea&s;onable. But the Apprehen&s;ion that the Parliament would
take more Notice of what the Earl had done, than They would of any
other Breach of Order that was every Day committed, was without any
<PB N="307" REF="311">
ju&s;t Rea&s;on.&endq; But that Argument was pre&s;ently &s;ilenced by their under|taking
to know Somewhat that the other could not do, and that there was
no other Way to pre&s;erve him but that which was propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>THERE was at that Time an Opportunity in View, that might give the
Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> an Employment very worthy of him, and which no Man
could imagine would be a&s;&s;igned to any Man who was in Di&s;grace.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An Account of Sir</HI> Richard Fan&s;haw's <HI>Emba&s;&s;y in</HI> Spain.</NOTE> Sir
<HI>Richard Fan&s;haw,</HI> who was a Gentleman very well known and very well
beloved, had been fir&s;t Amba&s;&s;adour in <HI>Portugal,</HI> and had behaved him&s;elf
&s;o well there, that when He returned from thence He was recommended,
<MILESTONE N="10">and upon the Matter de&s;ired, by that Crown to be &s;ent to <HI>Spain,</HI> as the
fitte&s;t Per&s;on to mediate in the King's Name between <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portu|gal;</HI>
and the King had before de&s;igned to &s;end him Amba&s;&s;adour into
<HI>Spain,</HI> as well to &s;ettle a Treaty between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> (for there
was none yet), as to do all the Offices between tho&s;e other Crowns which
were requi&s;ite to the End afore&s;aid. No Man knew that Court better
or was &s;o well ver&s;ed in the Language, having lived many Years before
in that Court in much better Times. He had remained now about two Years,
with &s;uch frequent Mortifications as Mini&s;ters u&s;e to meet with in Courts
irre&s;olute and perplexed in their own Affairs, as the Coun&s;els of <HI>Madrid</HI>
<MILESTONE N="20">were in the la&s;t Years of the King, as his Indi&s;po&s;ition increa&s;ed or by re|laxing
admini&s;tered &s;ome Hope. He had made a Journey to <HI>Li&s;bon</HI> upon
the earne&s;t De&s;ire of <HI>Spain,</HI> and returned without Effect. The Peace was
equally de&s;ired and equally nece&s;&s;ary to Both Nations: But the <HI>Portugal</HI> was
unmoveable in the Conditions of it, preferring the Wor&s;t that could fall out,
even the abandoning their Country, rather than to be without the Sove|reignty
of it; and the <HI>Spaniard</HI> as po&s;itive not to part with their Title,
though They had no Hope of their Subjection. Nor did <HI>Spain</HI> appear &s;o|licitous
to conclude any Treaty with <HI>England,</HI> except either <HI>Portugal</HI> might
be comprehended in it or abandoned by it.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30">ON a &s;udden, when the Recovery of the King grew more de&s;perate (which is
never a Thing notoriou&s;ly known in that Court), a Project for a Treaty was
&s;ent to the Amba&s;&s;adour, containing more Advantages in Trade to the Nation
(which are the mo&s;t important Matters in all tho&s;e Treaties), and in&s;i&s;ting
upon fewer inconvenient Conditions, than had ever been in any former
Treaties; without any Mention of <HI>Tangier</HI> or <HI>Jamaica,</HI> which had hi|therto
in the Entrance into any Treaty &s;ince the King's Return made the
Progre&s;s impo&s;&s;ible: Only it was urged, &startq;that it might either be pre&s;ently
accepted and &s;igned by the Amba&s;&s;adour, with a Covenant that it &s;hould
be confirmed by the King within &s;o many Days after it &s;hould be pre|&s;ented
<MILESTONE N="40">to him, or el&s;e that there &s;hould be no more Mention or Di&s;|cour&s;e
of it.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Amba&s;&s;adour, &s;urpri&s;ed with this Overture, compared what was
offered with what He was to demand by his In&s;tructions; and what was de|fective
in tho&s;e Particulars He added to the Articles pre&s;ented to him, with
&s;uch Additions as upon his own Ob&s;ervation and Conference with the Mer|chants
occurred to him, or which &s;eemed probable to be granted from Some|what
them&s;elves had offered more than had been demanded by him. The&s;e
Alterations and Amendments were approved and con&s;ented to, and quickly re|turned
engro&s;&s;ed and &s;igned by the King, on Condition to be pre&s;ently &s;igned
<MILESTONE N="50">by him, with the Undertaking that is formerly mentioned. It had been wi&s;ely
done by the Amba&s;&s;adour, and no more than his Duty, if He had fir&s;t ac|quainted
his Ma&s;ter or the Mini&s;ters with all that had pa&s;&s;ed, and expected a
particular Order before He had &s;igned it. But that being expre&s;&s;ly refu&s;ed,
<PB N="308" REF="312">
without concealing the Rea&s;on or the King's Weakne&s;s, &startq;which&endq; They de|clared
&startq;might make &s;uch an Alteration in Coun&s;els, that if it were not done
in his Life-Time They knew not what might happen after:&endq; This was
thought as good an Argument by him for the Di&s;patch as it was to them;
and that if He &s;hould not make U&s;e of this Conjuncture, there would never
be the like advantageous Treaty offered again. Hereupon He pre&s;ently
&s;igned the Treaty, with &s;ome &s;ecret Article which was not to the Advan|tage
of <HI>Portugal,</HI> otherwi&s;e than that He concluded, by what had been &s;aid
to him at <HI>Li&s;bon,</HI> it would have been acceptable to them.</P>
<P>THIS Treaty was no &s;ooner brought to the King by the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;|&s;adour<MILESTONE N="10">
(who had received it by an Expre&s;s) and peru&s;ed at the Council-Ta|ble,
but many gro&s;s Faults were found to be in it. Be&s;ides the Gentle|man's
Ab&s;ence, who would with greater Abilites have defended him&s;elf than
any of tho&s;e had who reproached him, it was no Advantage to him that
He was known to be much in the Chancellor's Confidence: And therefore
the more Pain was taken to per&s;uade the King that He was a weak Man
(which the King him&s;elf knew him not to be); and They put &s;uch a Glo&s;s
upon many of the Articles, and rejected others as unprofitable which were
thought to contain Matters of great Moment, that They would not con&s;ent
that a Trade to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> could be any Benefit to <HI>England,</HI> and the<MILESTONE N="20">
like. In the End, the King concluded that He would not &s;ign the Treaty;
for which He had &s;ome Acce&s;s of Rea&s;on within a Month after, by the
Death of the King of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN all the&s;e Reproaches were ca&s;t upon the Amba&s;&s;adour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is recalled.</NOTE> and Notice
given that the King did di&s;avow the Treaty and refu&s;ed to &s;ign it; it
was rea&s;onably re&s;olved that He ought not to remain there longer as Am|ba&s;&s;adour,
but to be recalled. But the Plague driving the King from <HI>Lon|don</HI>
and di&s;per&s;ing the Council, the pur&s;uing this Re&s;olution was no more
a&s;&s;umed, till the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> made it thought on as
a good Expedient; and the Chancellor was directed in his Di&s;cour&s;e with<MILESTONE N="30">
the Earl to mention it, as a proper Expedient in his Condition to be laid
Hold on and embraced.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor entered upon the whole Di&s;cour&s;e with that Freedom
and Openne&s;s that became a Man who He knew was not &s;u&s;pected by
him. He told him all that him&s;elf knew of the Affair, and the Ap|prehen&s;ion
the King had of the Parliament, and the Expedient He had
thought of to remove him out of the Reach or Noi&s;e of Clamour, of
which He made him the Judge; and &startq;if He did not like this Employment
for <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;ome other &s;hould be thought of and publi&s;hed before it &s;hould
be known, and before the Command of the Fleet &s;hould be committed to<MILESTONE N="40">
any other.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> lamented &startq;that it had been in any Body's Power
to make &s;o ill Impre&s;&s;ions in the King and the Duke, upon his having
committed a Tre&s;pa&s;s for which He was heartily &s;orry;&endq; and confe&s;&s;ed
it was a Pre&s;umption and Indi&s;cretion, the ill Con&s;equence whereof He
had not had Wit enough to di&s;cover: However He did not yet think it &s;o
great, as to make him fear to give an Account of it before the Parlia|ment,
or any Thing that They could do upon it.&endq; He &s;eemed not to be
ignorant of the Offices Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> did him, &startq;in drawing Com|plaints
and Reproaches from tho&s;e who had neither Cau&s;e nor Inclination<MILESTONE N="50">
to &s;peak to his Di&s;advantage. He was &s;en&s;ible of the General's Want of
Ju&s;tice towards him, which He knew not to what to impute but to
his Pride and Weakne&s;s. He did acknowledge it great Bounty in the
<PB N="309" REF="313">
King, &s;ince He thought him unfit and unworthy to continue in the Com|mand
He had, that He would yet a&s;&s;ign him to &s;o honourable an Em|ployment;
which, though it could not wipe off the Reproach of being
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the other Charge, was yet a &s;ufficient Evidence that He
was not out of his Maje&s;ty's good Opinion and Confidence: And there|fore
He did with all Cheerfulne&s;s &s;ubmit to his Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure, and
would be ready for his Journey to <HI>Spain</HI> as &s;oon as his Di&s;patch &s;hould be
prepared.&endq;</P>
<P>HE told him then, &startq;that He was in one Re&s;pect glad to be removed
<MILESTONE N="10">from his pre&s;ent Command, for He was confident that He would &s;ee no
more great Matters done at Sea, for that the common Men were weary of
the War; and that Sir <HI>William</HI> would never &s;uffer any Peace to be in the
Fleet, but had Creatures ready to do all ill Offices among&s;t them, whom
He cheri&s;hed and preferred before the be&s;t Officers;&endq; and told him many
other Things which fell out afterwards, and &s;aid &startq;Sir <HI>William</HI> would make
any Man who &s;hould &s;ucceed him weary of his Command, by &s;ending
&s;uch Variety of Orders that He would not know what to do.&endq; And &s;hortly
after He gave him a perfect Journal of his la&s;t Expedition, in which there
were indeed many Orders which mu&s;t needs &s;tartle and perplex a Commander
<MILESTONE N="20">in Chief, it being his u&s;ual Cour&s;e to &s;ignify the Duke's Plea&s;ure in Matters
of the greate&s;t Importance without the Duke's Hand; which yet They
dur&s;t not di&s;obey, nor produce in their own Ju&s;tification, being &s;uch as
in Truth were no &s;uch Warrants as They ought to obey, and yet would
reflect upon his Royal Highne&s;s: And told him likewi&s;e of the ill Inven|tions
He had &s;et on Foot, by which Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> was &s;topped from being
joined with him in the Command of the la&s;t Fleet.</P>
<P>WHEN the Chancellor had informed the King of the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI>
his Submi&s;&s;ion to his Plea&s;ure,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Sandwich <HI>&s;ent Amba&s;&s;a|dour Extraor|dinary into</HI> Spain.</NOTE> and that He would be ready to undertake
the Employment for <HI>Spain</HI> as &s;oon as his Maje&s;ty plea&s;ed; hereupon the King
<MILESTONE N="30">declared his Re&s;olution in Council to &s;end the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> his Extra|ordinary
Amba&s;&s;adour, as well to correct and amend the Mi&s;takes and Er|rours
in the late Treaty, as farther to mediate the Peace with <HI>Portugal,</HI>
which upon the Death of the King was in &s;ome Re&s;pect more practicable.
And to that Purpo&s;e He &s;ent Sir <HI>Robert Southwell,</HI> one of the Clerks of the
Council, Envoy into <HI>Portugal,</HI> that the Earl might the better know the
Inclinations of that People: And all In&s;tructions nece&s;&s;ary were pre&s;ently to
be prepared to Both tho&s;e Ends.</P>
<P>THIS fir&s;t Work being thus di&s;patched,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King thinks of ap|pointing Prince</HI> Rupert <HI>and the General joint Admirals.</HI></NOTE> it remained to &s;ettle the Com|mand,
for the en&s;uing Year, of the Fleet; and there can be little Doubt
<MILESTONE N="40">made, but that the King and the Duke had re&s;olved this at the &s;ame
Time that They determined that the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> &s;hould not continue
in it: However it was communicated to Nobody, till the De&s;ignation of the
other was publi&s;hed. Then the King told the Chancellor, &startq;that his Bro|ther
and He had long con&s;idered that Affair, and could not think of any
Expedient &s;o good for the Performance of that Service, as a Conjunction
between Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> and the General, and making them Both joint Com|manders
in Chief of the Fleet for the next Expedition.&endq; There had many
Exceptions occurred to them again&s;t committing the Charge to either of them
&s;ingly; nor were They without Apprehen&s;ion of &s;ome which might fall out
<MILESTONE N="50">by joining them together, which would be much greater, if They were not
Both well prepared to embrace the Occa&s;ion, and them&s;elves to like the De|&s;ignation.
For the doing this the Chancellor was again thought to be the
fitte&s;t Man, being believed to have the greate&s;t Intere&s;t in Both of them,
<PB N="310" REF="314">
and mo&s;t in him from whom the greate&s;t Difficulties were expected to ari&s;e,
which was Prince <HI>Rupert.</HI> It was ea&s;y to know Prince <HI>Rupert's</HI> Mind,
who was in the Hou&s;e: Yet They were Both in Ca&s;es of that Nature de|&s;irous
always to impart what They de&s;ired by others, rather than to debate
it fir&s;t them&s;elves. But then the General was at <HI>London,</HI> be&s;ieged by the
Plague; and the Matter was not fit to be communicated by Letter, be|cau&s;e,
if He &s;hould make any Scruple of concurring in it, it was to be
declined.</P>
<P>UPON the&s;e Con&s;iderations it was re&s;olved, fir&s;t, that the Chancellor
&s;hould prepare Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> and then that the General &s;hould be &s;ent for<MILESTONE N="10">
to <HI>Oxford</HI> upon Pretences, of which enough would occur. The Prince,
though He was much more willing to have gone alone,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prince</HI> Rupert <HI>willingly ac|cepts of a joint Commi&s;&s;ion.</HI></NOTE> willingly conformed
to the King's Plea&s;ure: And &s;o both the King and Duke &s;pake at large
with him upon all that was nece&s;&s;ary to be adju&s;ted. And the General was
&s;ent to, &startq;that it was nece&s;&s;ary for the King to confer with him upon &s;ome
Propo&s;itions, which were made to him upon the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Ships&endq; (which
Tran&s;action was not at that Time yet concluded); &startq;and therefore that on
&s;uch a Day He &s;hould come from <HI>London</HI> early in the Morning&endq; (for it
was deep Winter) &startq;in his own Coach to <HI>Beaconsfield,</HI> where He &s;hould
find another Coach ready to receive him, and another at another Stage;<MILESTONE N="20">
&s;o that He might be with Ea&s;e at <HI>Oxford</HI> the &s;ame Night,&endq; as He was,
and very graciou&s;ly received by the King, as He de&s;erved to be. But as He
had no Manner of Imagination of the true Rea&s;on why He was &s;ent for, &s;o
neither his Maje&s;ty nor the Duke would impart it to him, out of real Ima|gination
that it would not be grateful to him; but that was left to be im|parted
and dexterou&s;ly managed by the Chancellor, in whom, as was &s;aid
before, it was generally believed that He had great Confidence.</P>
<P>HE the next Morning entered into Conference with him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel|lor confers with the Ge|neral upon the Subject.</NOTE> and after general
Di&s;cour&s;es told him, &startq;that the King had di&s;po&s;ed the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> to
another Employment, for which He did not &s;eem &s;orry; and that it<MILESTONE N="30">
mu&s;t be now thought of, who was fit to command in his Place: That there
was no Hope of Peace, in&s;tead whereof there would be an entire Con|junction
between <HI>France</HI> and the <HI>Dutch;</HI> and that the <HI>French</HI> Fleet&endq; (the
Amba&s;&s;adours being about this Time gone) &startq;would be ready to join with them
as &s;oon as They &s;hould put to Sea; and there was much Doubt that the <HI>Dane</HI>
would betake him&s;elf to the &s;ame Alliance; and all would be at Sea before
We &s;hould be, except extraordinary Diligence were u&s;ed, which the Con|tinuance
of the Plague would hardly admit.&endq; The General pre&s;ently
an&s;wered, &startq;that no Per&s;on was &s;o fit for that Command as Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI>
who under&s;tood the Seas well, and had that Courage that was nece&s;&s;ary<MILESTONE N="40">
in this Conjuncture.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Chancellor told him, &startq;that the King had great Confidence in the
Affection and unque&s;tionable Courage of Prince <HI>Rupert:</HI> But He was not
&s;ure, that the Quickne&s;s of his Spirit and the Strength of his Pa&s;&s;ion might
not &s;ometimes &s;tand in Need of the Advice and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Friend, who
&s;hould be in equal Authority with him; and had therefore thought of find|ing
&s;ome fit Per&s;on to be joined with him, and &s;o make one Admiral of two
Per&s;ons.&endq; To which the other not replying &s;uddenly, He continued his
Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;aying &startq;that the King had &s;uch a Per&s;on in his View, whom
He would never acquaint with it, until He might find &s;ome Way to<MILESTONE N="50">
di&s;cover that the propo&s;ing it would not be ingrateful to him; and
that He was obliged to make this Di&s;covery, and that the Per&s;on in the
King's View was him&s;elf; and that if He and Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> were joined
<PB N="311" REF="315">
in the Command of the Fleet and undertook it, his Maje&s;ty would be|lieve
that He had done all that was in his Power, and would with great
Hope commit all the re&s;t to God Almighty.&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;He thought
He had behaved him&s;elf mo&s;t like a Friend in telling him &s;hortly and
plainly what the King's Drift was, towards which, though the Secret
was known to none but the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> yet &s;uch an Advance was
made, that his Maje&s;ty was well a&s;&s;ured that Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> would readily
comply with his Plea&s;ure.&endq; Upon the whole Matter He de&s;ired him &startq;to
deal as like a Friend with him, and to tell him freely if He had no Mind
<MILESTONE N="10">to the Employment; and He would take upon him to prevent the making
the Propo&s;ition to him, and that neither the King nor Duke &s;hould take
it unkindly.&endq;</P>
<P>THE General appeared really &s;urpri&s;ed and full of Thoughts: And after a
&s;hort Pau&s;e He de&s;ired him &startq;not to believe that He made the lea&s;t Difficulty
in his Thoughts of undertaking the Service; but many Things had oc|curred
to him in the Di&s;cour&s;e, which He would mention anon.&endq; He &s;aid,
that for his own Part He &s;hould be willing to go out of <HI>London</HI> To-mor|row,
and think him&s;elf much &s;afer in any Action again&s;t the <HI>Dutch</HI> than
He could be in the Po&s;t He was, where every Day Men died about him
<MILESTONE N="20">and in his View; and as He thought that He had done the King better
Service by &s;taying in <HI>London,</HI> than He could have done in any other Place,
&s;o He believed if the Sickne&s;s &s;hould continue&endq; (as it was like enough to
do, there appearing yet very little Decrea&s;e), &startq;his Maje&s;ty might think that
his Pre&s;ence might be as nece&s;&s;ary there as it had been.&endq; The Chan|cellor
replied, &startq;that his Maje&s;ty had fore&s;een that Contingency; and had
already re&s;olved that if that fell out to be the Ca&s;e, He &s;hould rather de|&s;ire
his Re&s;idence &s;hould be where it had been (though He was much
troubled to expo&s;e him to &s;o much Hazard) than in any other Place:
But that his Maje&s;ty's Confidence in the Mercy of God, that He would
<MILESTONE N="30">take off this heavy Vi&s;itation before the End of Winter, had &s;ugge&s;ted
the other De&s;ignation of him to the Service of the Fleet, upon the good
Conduct whereof his own and the Kingdom's Happine&s;s &s;o much de|pended.&endq;</P>
<P>THE General quickly replied,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The General &s;ubmits to the King's Plea|&s;ure.</NOTE> &startq;that for that Matter He was &s;o willing
to engage him&s;elf, that if the King plea&s;ed He would mo&s;t readily &s;erve
under the Command of Prince <HI>Rupert:</HI>&endq; To which the other an&s;wered
as readily, &startq;that the King would never con&s;ent to that.&endq; And &s;o They
re&s;olved pre&s;ently to go to the King, that his Maje&s;ty and the Duke might
know what would plea&s;e them &s;o much. And as They were going, the
<MILESTONE N="40">General &s;aid &s;miling, &startq;that He would tell him now what the true Cau&s;e
was, that had made that Pau&s;e in him upon the fir&s;t Di&s;cour&s;e of the
Bu&s;ine&s;s; and that it would be nece&s;&s;ary for him, after all Things &s;hould
be adju&s;ted with the King and Duke and Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> that what con|cerned
him &s;hould &s;till remain a Secret, and Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> be under&s;tood
to have that Command alone. For if his Wife &s;hould come to know it,
before He had by Degrees prepared her for it, She would break out into
&s;uch Pa&s;&s;ions as would be very unea&s;y to him: But He would in a &s;hort
Time di&s;po&s;e her well enough; and in the mean Time Nothing &s;hould
be omitted on his Part, that was nece&s;&s;ary for the Advancement of the
<MILESTONE N="50">Service.&endq; Hereupon the King, the Duke, the Prince and the Ge|neral
con&s;ulted of all that was to be done: And He at the End of two
Days returned to <HI>London</HI> with the &s;ame Expedition that He came to <HI>Ox|ford,</HI>
together with Sir <HI>George Carteret</HI> the Trea&s;urer of the Navy, and all
<PB N="312" REF="316">
Orders that were requi&s;ite for the Sale of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Ships, upon which
all Provi&s;ions for the Fleet were to be made.</P>
<P>THOUGH the Parliament at <HI>Oxford</HI> had pre&s;erved that excellent Harmony
that the King had propo&s;ed, and hardly wi&s;hed any Thing in which They
had not concurred, in&s;omuch as never Parliament &s;o entirely &s;ympathi&s;ed
with his Maje&s;ty; and though it pa&s;&s;ed more Acts for his Honour and Se|curity
than any other had ever done in &s;o &s;hort a Se&s;&s;ion: Yet it produced a
Precedent of a very unhappy Nature, the Circum&s;tances whereof in the pre|&s;ent
were unu&s;ual and pernicious, and the Con&s;equences in the future very
mi&s;chievous, and therefore not unfit to be &s;et out at large.<MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> and Sir <HI>William Coventry,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">An Attempt to remove the Trea&s;urer.</NOTE> clo&s;ely united in the
&s;ame Purpo&s;es and e&s;pecially again&s;t the Chancellor, had a great De&s;ire to
find &s;ome Means to change the Cour&s;e and Method of the King's Coun&s;els;
which They could hardly do whil&s;t the &s;ame Per&s;ons continued &s;till in the
&s;ame Employments. Their Malice was mo&s;t again&s;t the Chancellor: Yet
They knew not what Sugge&s;tions to make to the King again&s;t him, having
always pretended to his Maje&s;ty, how fal&s;ely &s;oever, to have a great E&s;teem
of him. Their Project therefore was to remove the Trea&s;urer, who was as
weary of his Office and of the Court as any Body could be of him: But his
Reputation was &s;o great, his Wi&s;dom &s;o unque&s;tionable, and his Integrity<MILESTONE N="20">
&s;o confe&s;&s;ed, that They knew in neither of tho&s;e Points He could be im|peached.
And the King him&s;elf had Kindne&s;s and Reverence towards him,
though He had for &s;ome Years thought him le&s;s active, and &s;o le&s;s fit for
that Admini&s;tration, than every Body el&s;e knew him to be: And the&s;e
Men had long in&s;inuated unto his Maje&s;ty, &startq;how ill all the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the
Exchequer was managed by the continual Infirmities of the Trea&s;urer,
who between the Gout and the Stone had not Ea&s;e enough to attend the
painful Function of that Office, but left the Whole to be managed and
governed by his Secretary Sir <HI>Philip Warwick;</HI>&endq; upon who&s;e Experience
and Fidelity He did in Truth much rely, as He had Rea&s;on to do, his<MILESTONE N="30">
Reputation for Both being very &s;ignal and univer&s;al. And towards fa&s;ten|ing
this Reproach They had the Contribution of the Lord <HI>A&s;hley,</HI> who was
good at looking into other Mens Offices, and was not plea&s;ed to &s;ee Sir
<HI>Philip Warwick's</HI> Credit greater than his with the Trea&s;urer, and his Ad|vice
more followed. And the other two had craftily in&s;inuated to him,
that He would make much a better Trea&s;urer; which, whil&s;t He thought
They were in Earne&s;t, prevailed with him not only to &s;ugge&s;t Materials to
them for that Reproach, but to inculcate the &s;ame to the King upon &s;everal
Occa&s;ions: But when He di&s;covered that They intended Nothing of Ad|vantage
to his Particular, He withdrew from that Intrigue, though in all<MILESTONE N="40">
other Particulars He &s;ided with them.</P>
<P>THE King was too ea&s;y in making A&s;&s;ignations upon his Revenue,
which would make it uncapable to &s;atisfy others which were more nece&s;|&s;ary,
and to grant Suits by Lea&s;e or Farm (&s;ometimes to worthy Men),
which were of mi&s;chievous Con&s;equence to all the Mea&s;ures which could
be taken; and tho&s;e the Trea&s;urer found him&s;elf obliged to &s;top: And com|monly
upon informing the King of it and of his Rea&s;ons, his Maje&s;ty was
very well plea&s;ed with what He had done, and (as hath been &s;aid before)
did often give him&s;elf Ea&s;e from the Importunity of many, by &s;igning the
Warrants They brought to him, in Confidence that either the Chancellor or<MILESTONE N="50">
Trea&s;urer would not &s;uffer them to pa&s;s. However it rai&s;ed Clamour; and
there were Men enough who had the &s;ame Provocation to make a great
Noi&s;e; and They ea&s;ily found Countenance from others, who de&s;ired it
<PB N="313" REF="317">
&s;hould be believed, &startq;that it was a high Arrogance and Pre&s;umption in any
Subject to &s;top any Signature of the King, and &s;o make his Maje&s;ty's
Grace and Bounty to be ineffectual, if his Approbation and Con&s;ent was
not likewi&s;e procured.&endq; There was vi&s;ibly great Want of Money, though
there were va&s;t Sums rai&s;ed; which They laboured to per&s;uade the King
proceeded from the Un&s;kilfulne&s;s or Unactivity of the Trea&s;urer, who was
again tired with the Vexation and Indignity, when He had &s;o frequently
pre&s;ented the King with the Particulars of the Receipts and Di&s;bur&s;ements,
and made it demon&s;trable how much his Expen&s;es exceeded all his Income;
<MILESTONE N="10">and how impo&s;&s;ible it would be, without le&s;&s;ening the&s;e, to provide where|withal
to &s;upply nece&s;&s;ary Occa&s;ions: But this was an ungracious Subject,
and opened more Mouths than could ea&s;ily be &s;topped.</P>
<P>THERE was a Man who hath been often named, Sir <HI>George Downing,</HI>
who by having been &s;ome Years in the Office of one of the Tellers of the
Exchequer, and being of a re&s;tle&s;s Brain, did under&s;tand enough of the Na|ture
of the Revenue and of the Cour&s;e of the Receipt, to make others who
under&s;tood le&s;s of it to think that He knew the Bottom of it, and that the
Expedients, which &s;hould be propo&s;ed by him towards a Reformation, could
not but be very pertinent and practicable. And He was not unhurt in the
<MILESTONE N="20">Emoluments of his own Office, which were le&s;&s;ened by the A&s;&s;ignations made
to the Bankers upon the Receipts them&s;elves, without the Money's ever
pa&s;&s;ing through the Tellers Office; by which, though They did receive their
ju&s;t Fees, They had not what They would have taken if the Money had
pa&s;&s;ed through their own Hands. He was a Member of Parliament, and a
very voluminous Speaker, who would be thought wi&s;er in Trade than any
of the Merchants, and to under&s;tand the My&s;tery of all Profe&s;&s;ions much
better than the Profe&s;&s;ors of them. And &s;uch a Kind of Chat is always ac|ceptable
in a Crowd (where few under&s;tand many Subjects), who are always
glad to find tho&s;e put out of Countenance who thought They under&s;tood it
<MILESTONE N="30">be&s;t: And &s;o They were much plea&s;ed to hear Sir <HI>George Downing</HI> inveigh
again&s;t the Ignorance of tho&s;e, who could only &s;mile at his Want of
Knowledge.</P>
<P>THIS Gentleman was very grateful to Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> as well as to
Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> and was ready to in&s;truct them in all the Mi&s;carriages and
Over&s;ights in the Trea&s;ury, and to propo&s;e Ways of Reformation to them.
&startq;The Root of all Mi&s;carriage was the unlimited Power of the Lord Trea|&s;urer,
that no Money could i&s;&s;ue out without his particular Direction,
and all Money was paid upon no other Rules than his Order; &s;o that let
the King want as much as was po&s;&s;ible, no Money could be paid by his
<MILESTONE N="40">without the Trea&s;urer's Warrant;&endq; which to Men who under&s;tood no
more than They did &s;eemed a very great Incongruity.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Project of Sir</HI> George Downing <HI>to new-model the Trea&s;ury.</HI></NOTE> &startq;But,&endq; He &s;aid,
if there were &s;uch a Clau&s;e in&s;erted into the Bill which was to be pa&s;&s;ed
in the Hou&s;e of Commons for Money, it might prevent all Inconveniences,
and the King's Money would be paid only to tho&s;e Per&s;ons and Purpo&s;es
to which his Maje&s;ty &s;hould a&s;&s;ign them; and more Money would be
pre&s;ently advanced upon this Act of Parliament, than the Credit of the
Bankers could procure;&endq; for He fore&s;aw, that would be a very natural
Objection again&s;t his Clau&s;e and the Method He propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>HE made his Di&s;cour&s;e &s;o plau&s;ible to them that They were much
<MILESTONE N="50">plea&s;ed with it; and it provided for &s;o many of their own Ends, that They
neither did nor were able to con&s;ider the Rever&s;e of it, but were mo&s;t &s;oli|citous
that there might no Ob&s;tructions ari&s;e in the Way. If it &s;hould
come to the Knowledge of the Chancellor, He would oppo&s;e it for the
<PB N="314" REF="318">
Novelty, and the Con&s;equences that might attend it; and if the Trea|&s;urer
had Notice of it, He would not con&s;ent to it for the Indignity that
his Office was &s;ubjected to: They therefore di&s;cour&s;ed it to the King as
a Matter of high Importance to his Service if it were &s;ecretly carried; and
then brought the Projector, who was an indefatigable Talker, to inform
his Maje&s;ty of the many Benefits which would accrue to his Service by
this new Method that He had devi&s;ed, and the many Mi&s;chiefs which would
be prevented.</P>
<P>THERE were many Things which were &s;ugge&s;ted, that were agreeable
to &s;ome Fancies that the King him&s;elf had entertained; there would not<MILESTONE N="10">
need now &s;o many Formalities, as Warrants and Privy Seals, before Monies
could be paid; and Money might hereafter i&s;&s;ue out and be paid without
the Trea&s;urer's Privity; in which many Conveniences &s;eemed to appear:
Though be&s;ides the Innovation and Breach of all old Order, which is ever
attended by many Mi&s;chiefs unfore&s;een, there were very great Inconveniences
in View in tho&s;e very Particulars which They fancied to be Conveniences.
But it was enough that the King &s;o well liked the Advice upon Conference
with them three, that He re&s;olved to communicate it with no others; but
appointed that when the Bill for Supply &s;hould be brought into the Hou&s;e
(it being to be, as was &s;aid before, for the Sum of&mdash;), at the Com|mitment<MILESTONE N="20">
<HI>Downing</HI> &s;hould offer that <HI>Provi&s;o,</HI> which had been drawn by him|&s;elf,
and read to the King and the other two. And becau&s;e it was fore|&s;een,
that it would be oppo&s;ed by many of tho&s;e who were known to be
very affectionate to the King's Service, They had all Authority privately
to a&s;&s;ure them, that it was offered with the King's Approbation.</P>
<P>AGAINST the Time that the Bill was to be brought in, They prepared
the Hou&s;e by many un&s;ea&s;onable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Clamour rai&s;ed again&s;t the Bankers.</NOTE> bitter Invectives again&s;t the Bankers,
called them Cheats, Blood&s;uckers, Extortioners, and loaded them with all
the Reproaches which can be ca&s;t upon the wor&s;t Men in the World, and
would have them looked upon as the Cau&s;es of all the King's Nece&s;&s;ities,<MILESTONE N="30">
and of the Want of Monies throughout the Kingdom: All which was a
plau&s;ible Argument, as all Invectives again&s;t particular Men are; and all
Men who had Faculties of depraving, and of making ill Things appear
wor&s;e than they are, were ea&s;ily engaged with them. The Bankers did not
con&s;i&s;t of above the Number of five or &s;ix Men, &s;ome whereof were Al|dermen
and had been Lord-Mayors of <HI>London,</HI> and all the re&s;t were Al|dermen
or had fined for Aldermen. They were a Tribe that had ri&s;en
and grown up in <HI>Cromwell's</HI> Time, and never were heard of before the
late Troubles, till when the whole Trade of Money had pa&s;&s;ed through
the Hands of the Scriveners: They were for the mo&s;t Part Gold&s;miths,<MILESTONE N="40">
Men known to be &s;o rich, and of &s;o good Reputation, that all the Mo|ney
of the Kingdom would be tru&s;ted or depo&s;ited in their Hands.</P>
<P>FROM the Time of the King's Return,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Advantage ari&s;ing from the Bankers.</NOTE> when though great and va&s;t Sums
were granted, yet &s;uch va&s;t Debts were pre&s;ently to be paid, the Armies
by Land and Sea to be pre&s;ently di&s;charged, that the Money that was to be
collected in &s;ix and &s;ix Months would not provide for tho&s;e pre&s;ent unavoid|able
I&s;&s;ues; but there mu&s;t be two or three hundred thou&s;and Pounds gotten
together in few Days, before They could begin to di&s;band the Armies or to
pay the Seamen off; the deferring whereof every Month increa&s;ed the
Charge to an incredible Proportion: None could &s;upply tho&s;e Occa&s;ions<MILESTONE N="50">
but the Bankers, which brought the King's Mini&s;ters fir&s;t acquainted with
them; and They were &s;o well &s;atisfied with their Proceedings, that They
did always declare, &startq;that They were &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the King's Affairs,
<PB N="315" REF="319">
that They knew not how to have conducted them without that A&s;|&s;i&s;tance.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Method of Proceeding with them was thus.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Method of treating with them.</NOTE> As &s;oon as an Act of
Parliament was pa&s;&s;ed, the King &s;ent for tho&s;e Bankers (for there was never
any Contract made with them but in his Maje&s;ty's Pre&s;ence): And He being
attended by the Mini&s;ters of the Revenue, and commonly the Chancellor and
others of the Council, the Lord Trea&s;urer pre&s;ented a particular Informa|tion
to the King of the mo&s;t urgent Occa&s;ions for pre&s;ent Money, either
for di&s;banding Troops, or di&s;charging Ships, or &s;etting out Fleets (all which
<MILESTONE N="10">are to be done together and not by Parcels); &s;o that it was ea&s;ily fore&s;een
what ready Money mu&s;t be provided. And this Account being made, the
Bankers were called in, and told, &startq;that the King had Occa&s;ion to u&s;e &s;uch
a Sum of ready Money within &s;uch a Day; They under&s;tood the Act of
Parliament, and &s;o might determine what Money They could lend the King,
and what Manner of Security would be&s;t &s;atisfy them.&endq; Whereupon one
&s;aid, &startq;He would within &s;uch a Time pay one hundred thou&s;and Pounds,&endq;
another more, and another le&s;s, as They found them&s;elves provided; for there
was no joint Stock among&s;t them, but every one &s;upplied according to his
Ability. They were de&s;irous to have eight in the Hundred, which was
<MILESTONE N="20">not unrea&s;onable to a&s;k and the King was willing to give: But upon better
Con&s;ideration among&s;t them&s;elves, They thought fit to decline that De|mand
as being capable of turning to their Di&s;advantage, and would leave
the Intere&s;t to the King's own Bounty, declaring &startq;that them&s;elves paid &s;ix
in the hundred for all the Money with which They were intru&s;ted,&endq;
which was known to be true.</P>
<P>THEN They demanded &s;uch a Receipt and A&s;&s;ignment to be made to
them by the Lord Trea&s;urer, for the Payment of the fir&s;t Money that
&s;hould be payable upon that Act of Parliament, or a Branch of that Act,
or Tallies upon the Farmers of the Cu&s;toms or Exci&s;e, or &s;uch other
<MILESTONE N="30">Branches of the Revenue as were lea&s;t charged; having the King's own
Word and the Faith of the Trea&s;urer, that they &s;hould be exactly com|plied
with; for let the Security be what They could de&s;ire, it would &s;till be
in the Power of the King or of the Lord Trea&s;urer to divert what was a&s;|&s;igned
to them to other Purpo&s;es. Therefore there is Nothing &s;urer, than
that the Confidence in the King's Ju&s;tice, and the unque&s;tionable Repu|tation
of the Lord Trea&s;urer's Honour and Integrity, was the true Foun|dation
of that Credit which &s;upplied all his Maje&s;ty's Nece&s;&s;ities and Occa|&s;ions;
and his Maje&s;ty always treated tho&s;e Men very graciou&s;ly as his very
good Servants, and all his Mini&s;ters looked upon them as very hone&s;t
<MILESTONE N="40">and valuable Men. And in this Manner for many Years after his Maje&s;ty's
Return, even to the unhappy Beginning of the <HI>Dutch</HI> War, the publick Ex|pen&s;es
were carried on, it may be, with too little Difficulty, which po&s;&s;ibly
increa&s;ed &s;ome Expen&s;es; and Nobody opened his Mouth again&s;t the
Bankers, who every Day increa&s;ed in Credit and Reputation, and had the
Money of all Men at their Di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P>THE Solicitor General brought in the Bill for Supply according to Cour&s;e,
in that Form as tho&s;e Bills for Money ought and u&s;ed to be: And after it
had been read the &s;econd Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Downing <HI>of|fers a new</HI> Provi&s;o <HI>in the Bill for the Supply.</HI></NOTE> when it was committed <HI>Downing</HI> offered

<MILESTONE N="50">to be rai&s;ed by this Bill to be applied only to tho&s;e Ends to which it
was given, which was the carrying on the War, and to no other Pur|po&s;e
what&s;oever, by what Authority &s;oever;&endq; with many other Clau&s;es
in it &s;o mon&s;trous, that the Solicitor and many others who were mo&s;t

watchful for the King's Service declared again&s;t it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which is op|po&s;ed by the Solicitor Ge|neral.</NOTE> as introductive to a
Commonwealth, and not fit for Monarchy. It was ob&s;erved, &startq;that the
A&s;&s;ignment of the Money that was given by Act of Parliament to be paid
in another Manner and to other Per&s;ons than had been formerly u&s;ed,
though there wanted not plau&s;ible Pretences, was the Beginning of the
late Rebellion, and furni&s;hed the Parliament with Money to rai&s;e a Re|bellion,
when the King had none to defend him&s;elf; which had made
<HI>Cromwell</HI> wi&s;e enough never to permit any of tho&s;e Clau&s;es, or that
the Impo&s;itions which were rai&s;ed &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to any U&s;es or by
any Per&s;ons but by him&s;elf and his own Orders.&endq; And by &s;uch and<MILESTONE N="10">
other Arguments, which the Contrivers had not fore&s;een, the <HI>Provi&s;o</HI> had
been ab&s;olutely thrown out, if Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> and <HI>Downing</HI> had not
gone to the Solicitor and others who &s;pake again&s;t it, and a&s;&s;ured them,
&startq;that it was brought in by the King's own Direction, and for Purpo&s;es well
under&s;tood by his Maje&s;ty.&endq; Upon which They were contented that it
&s;hould be committed, yet with Direction &startq;that &s;uch and &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions

<P>IN the Afternoon the King &s;ent for the Solicitor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King com|mands him not to oppo&s;e it farther.</NOTE> and forbad him any

en&s;ue upon his own Account, for the Benefits which would accrue, and
which it was not yet &s;ea&s;onable to communicate with other Members of

&s;hould be lent To-morrow to be paid before that which was lent Ye&s;|terday,
but that all &s;hould be infallibly paid in Order; by which the Ex|chequer
(which was now Bankrupt and without any Credit) would be
quickly in that Reputation, that all Men would depo&s;ite their Money
there: And that He hoped in few Years, by ob&s;erving the Method He
now propo&s;ed, He would make his Exchequer the be&s;t and the greate&s;t

this Di&s;cour&s;e the vain Man, who had lived many Years in <HI>Holland,</HI> and
would be thought to have made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of all their Policy, had
amu&s;ed the King, and his two Friends, undertaking to erect the King's
Exchequer into the &s;ame Degree of Credit that the Bank of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> &s;tood
upon, the In&s;titution whereof He undertook to know, and from thence to
make it evident, &startq;that all that &s;hould be tran&s;planted into <HI>England,</HI> and
all Nations would &s;ooner &s;end their Money into the Exchequer, than into
<HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> or <HI>Genoa</HI> or <HI>Venice.</HI>&endq; And it cannot be enough wondered
at, that this Intoxication prevailed &s;o far that no Argument would be heard
again&s;t it, the King having upon tho&s;e Notions, and with the Advice of<MILESTONE N="50">
tho&s;e Coun&s;ellors, in his own Thoughts new-modelled the whole Govern|ment
<PB N="317" REF="321">
of his Trea&s;ury, in which He re&s;olved to have no more &s;uperiour Of|ficers.
But this was only re&s;erved within his own Brea&s;t, and not com|municated
to any but tho&s;e who devi&s;ed the Project, without weighing that
the Security for Monies &s;o depo&s;ited in Banks is the Republick it&s;elf, which
mu&s;t expire before that Security can fail; which can never be depended on
in a Monarchy, where the Monarch's &s;ole Word can cancel all tho&s;e formal
Provi&s;ions which can be made (as hath &s;ince been too evident), by vacating
tho&s;e A&s;&s;ignations which have been made upon that and the like Acts of
Parliament, for &s;uch Time as the pre&s;ent Nece&s;&s;ities have made coun&s;ellable;
<MILESTONE N="10">which would not then be admitted to be po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>AND &s;o without any more Oppo&s;ition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">It is pa&s;&s;ed by the Commons.</NOTE> which was not grateful to the
King, that Act pa&s;&s;ed the Hou&s;e of Commons, with the Correction only of
&s;uch Ab&s;urdities as had not been fore&s;een by tho&s;e who framed the <HI>Provi&s;o,</HI>
and which did indeed cro&s;s their own De&s;igns: And &s;o it was &s;ent from the
Commons to the Hou&s;e of Peers for their Con&s;ent.</P>
<P>BILLS of that Nature which concern the rai&s;ing of Money &s;eldom &s;tay
long with the Lords; but as of Cu&s;tom, which They call Privilege, they
are fir&s;t begun in the Hou&s;e of Commons, where they endure long Deli|beration,
&s;o when they are adju&s;ted there, they &s;eem to pa&s;s through the
<MILESTONE N="20">Hou&s;e of Peers with the reading twice and formal Commitment, in which
any Alterations are very rarely made, except in any Impo&s;itions which are
laid upon their own Per&s;ons, for which there are u&s;ually Blanks left, the
filling up whereof is all the Amendment or Alteration that is commonly
made by the Lords: So that the &s;ame Engro&s;&s;ment that is &s;ent up by the
Commons is u&s;ually the Bill it&s;elf that is pre&s;ented to the King for his Royal
A&s;&s;ent. Yet there can be no rea&s;onable Doubt made, but that tho&s;e Bills
of any Kind of Sub&s;idies, as Exci&s;e, Chimney-Money, or any other Way
of Impo&s;ition, are as much the Gift and Pre&s;ent from the Hou&s;e of Peers as
they are from the Hou&s;e of Commons, and are no more valid without their
<MILESTONE N="30">Con&s;ent than without the Con&s;ent of the other; and They may alter any
Clau&s;e in them that They do not think for the Good of the People. But be|cau&s;e
the Hou&s;e of Commons is the immediate Repre&s;entative of the Peo|ple,
it is pre&s;umed that They be&s;t know what They can bear or are willing
to &s;ubmit to, and what They propo&s;e to give is proportionable to what
They can &s;pare; and therefore the Lords u&s;e not to put any Stop in the
Pa&s;&s;age of &s;uch Bills, much le&s;s dimini&s;h what is offered by them to
the King.</P>
<P>AND in this Parliament the Expedition that was u&s;ed in all Bu&s;ine&s;s out
of Fear of the Sickne&s;s, and out of an impatient De&s;ire to be &s;eparated, was
<MILESTONE N="40">very notorious: And as &s;oon as this Bill for Supply was &s;ent to the Lords,
very many Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons left the Town and departed,
conceiving that there was no more left for them to do; for it was gene|rally
thought, that at the pa&s;&s;ing that Act with the re&s;t which were ready,
the King would prorogue the Parliament. Yet the Novelty in this Act &s;o
&s;urpri&s;ed the Lords, that They thought it worthy a very &s;erious Deliberation,
and u&s;ed not their cu&s;tomary Expedition in the pa&s;&s;ing it. It happened
to be in an ill Conjuncture, when the terrible cold Weather kept the Lord
Trea&s;urer from going out of his Chamber for Fear of the Gout, of which
the Chancellor laboured then in that Extremity, that He was obliged to
<MILESTONE N="50">remain in his Bed; and neither of them had received Information of this
Affair.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some Lords re|mon&s;trate to the King a|gain&s;t this Pro|vi&s;o.</NOTE> Many of the Lords came to them and adverti&s;ed them of this new
<HI>Provi&s;o;</HI> and &s;ome of them went to the King to let him know the Pre|judice
<PB N="318" REF="322">
it would bring him, and cen&s;ured the ill Hand that had con|trived
it.</P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>A&s;hley,</HI> who was Chancellor of the Exchequer, and had been
privy in the fir&s;t Cabal in which this Reformation was de&s;igned, whether
becau&s;e He found him&s;elf left out in the mo&s;t &s;ecret Part of it, or not enough
con&s;idered in it, pa&s;&s;ionately inveighed again&s;t it both publickly and pri|vately,
and according to the Fertility of his Wit and Invention found more
Objections again&s;t it than any Body el&s;e had done, and the Con&s;equences to
be more de&s;tructive; with which He &s;o alarmed the King, that his Ma|je&s;ty
was contented that the Matter &s;hould be debated in his Pre&s;ence;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King con|&s;ults the pri|vate Commit|tee upon it.</NOTE> and<MILESTONE N="10">
becau&s;e the Chancellor was in his Bed, thought his Chamber to be the fitte&s;t
Place for the Con&s;ultation: And the Lord Trea&s;urer, though indi&s;po&s;ed and
apprehen&s;ive of the Gout, could yet u&s;e his Feet, and was very willing to
attend his Maje&s;ty there, without the lea&s;t Imagination that He was aimed
at in the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>THE King appointed the Hour for the Meeting, where his Maje&s;ty with
his Brother was pre&s;ent, the Chancellor in his Bed, the Lord Trea&s;urer, the
Lord <HI>A&s;hley,</HI> the Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> and Sir <HI>William Coventry;</HI> the Attorney
General and the Solicitor were likewi&s;e pre&s;ent to word any Alterations which
&s;hould be fit to be made; and Sir <HI>George Downing</HI> likewi&s;e attended, who the<MILESTONE N="20">
King &s;till believed would be able to an&s;wer all Objections which could be
made. The Chancellor had never &s;een the <HI>Provi&s;o</HI> which contained all the
Novelty (for all the other Parts of the Bill were according to the Cour&s;e),
and the Trea&s;urer had read it only an Hour or two before the Meeting:
The Lord <HI>A&s;hley</HI> therefore, who had heard it read in the Hou&s;e of Peers and
ob&s;erved what that Hou&s;e thought of it, opened the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s with
the Novelty, and the ill Con&s;equence that mu&s;t inevitably attend it; all
which He enforced with great Clearne&s;s and Evidence of Rea&s;on, and would
have enlarged with &s;ome Sharpne&s;s upon the Advi&s;ers of it.</P>
<P>BUT the King him&s;elf &s;topped that by declaring, &startq;that what&s;oever had<MILESTONE N="30">
been done in the whole Tran&s;action of it had been with his Privity and
Approbation, and the whole Blame mu&s;t be laid to his own Charge, who
it &s;eems was like to &s;uffer mo&s;t by it.&endq; He confe&s;&s;ed, &startq;He was &s;o fully
convinced in his own Under&s;tanding, that the Method propo&s;ed would
prove to his infinite Advantage and to the Benefit of the Kingdom, that
He had converted many in the Hou&s;e who had di&s;liked it; and that &s;ince
it came into the Hou&s;e of Peers, He had &s;poken with many of the Lords
who &s;eemed mo&s;t un&s;atisfied with it: And He was confident He had &s;o
well informed many of them, that They had changed their Opinion and
would be no more again&s;t that <HI>Provi&s;o.</HI> However He confe&s;&s;ed that<MILESTONE N="40">
&s;ome remained &s;till ob&s;tinate again&s;t it, and They had given &s;ome Rea&s;ons
which He had not thought of, and which in Truth He could not an&s;wer:
He wi&s;hed therefore that They would apply them&s;elves to the mo&s;t
weighty Objections which were in View, or which might probably
re&s;ult from thence, and think of the be&s;t Remedies which might be ap|plied
by Alterations and Amendments in the Hou&s;e of Lords, which He
doubted not but that the Commons would concur in.&endq;</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Objection was &startq;the Novelty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Objections made again&s;t it there.</NOTE> which in Ca&s;es of that Nature
was very dangerous, remembering what hath been mentioned before of
the Beginning of the late Rebellion, by putting the Money to run in ano|ther<MILESTONE N="50">
Channel than it had u&s;ed to do: And that when once &s;uch a Clau&s;e
was admitted in one Bill, the King would hardly get it left out in others
of the &s;ame Kind hereafter; and &s;o his Maje&s;ty &s;hould never be Ma&s;ter
<PB N="319" REF="323">
his own Money, nor the Mini&s;ters of his Revenue be able to a&s;&s;ign Mo|nies
to defray any ca&s;ual Expen&s;es of what Nature &s;oever; but that upon
the Matter the Authority of the Trea&s;urer and Chancellor of the Exche|quer
mu&s;t be inve&s;ted in the Tellers of the Exchequer, who were &s;ubor|dinate
Officers, and qualified to do Nothing but by the immediate Order
of tho&s;e their &s;uperiour Officers. And though there are four Tellers in
equal Authority, yet Sir <HI>George Downing</HI> would in a &s;hort Time make
his Office the &s;ole Receipt, and the re&s;t neither receive nor pay but by
his Favour and Con&s;ent.&endq;</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10">THE King had in his Nature &s;o little Reverence or E&s;teem for Antiquity,
and did in Truth &s;o much contemn old Orders, Forms and In&s;titutions,
that the Objections of Novelty rather advanced than ob&s;tructed any Propo&s;i|tion.
He was a great Lover of new Inventions, and thought them the Effects
of Wit and Spirit, and fit to control the &s;uper&s;titious Ob&s;ervation of the Dic|tates
of our Ance&s;tors: So that Objection made little Impre&s;&s;ion. And for
the Continuance of the &s;ame Clau&s;e in future Bills, He looked for it as
nece&s;&s;ary in Order to the E&s;tabli&s;hment of his Bank, which would abun|dantly
recompen&s;e for his Lo&s;s of Power in Di&s;po&s;al of his own Money.
And though it was made appear by very &s;olid Arguments, that the Ima|gination
<MILESTONE N="20">of a Bank was a mere Chimera in it&s;elf, and the erecting it in the
Exchequer mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that the Crown mu&s;t be always liable to a va&s;t
Debt upon Intere&s;t, which would be very ill Hu&s;bandry; and that there
was great Hope, that after a happy Peace &s;hould be concluded, and Care
&s;hould be taken to bring the Expen&s;es into a narrower Compa&s;s, the King
might in a &s;hort Time be out of Debt: Yet all Di&s;cour&s;e again&s;t a Bank was
thought to proceed from pure Ignorance. And Sir <HI>George</HI> was let loo&s;e to in|&s;truct
them how ea&s;y it was to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, who talked imperiou&s;ly &startq;of the
Method by which it came to be &s;ettled in <HI>Holland</HI> by the Indu&s;try of very
few Per&s;ons, when the greate&s;t Men de&s;paired of it as impracticable; yet the
<MILESTONE N="30">Ob&s;tinacy of the other prevailed, and it was now become the Strength,
Wealth and Security of the State: That the &s;ame would be brought to
pa&s;s much more ea&s;ily here, and would be no &s;ooner done, than <HI>Eng|land</HI>
would be the Seat of all the Trade of <HI>Chri&s;tendom.</HI>&endq; And then
a&s;&s;uming all He &s;aid to be Demon&s;tration, He wrapped him&s;elf up, ac|cording
to his Cu&s;tom, in a Mi&s;t of Words that Nobody could &s;ee Light
in, but They who by often hearing the &s;ame Chat thought They under|&s;tood
it.</P>
<P>THE next Objection was &startq;again&s;t the Inju&s;tice of this Clau&s;e, and the
ill Con&s;equence of that Inju&s;tice. The Nece&s;&s;ities of the Crown being
<MILESTONE N="40">&s;till pre&s;&s;ing, and the Fleet every Day calling for Supply, Money had
been borrowed from the Bankers upon the Credit of this Bill, as &s;oon as
the fir&s;t Vote had pa&s;&s;ed in the Hou&s;e of Commons for &s;o con&s;iderable a
Supply; and the Trea&s;urer had made A&s;&s;ignments upon &s;everal Branches
of the Revenue, which had been pre&s;erved and de&s;igned for the Army
and the immediate Expen&s;es of the King's and Queen's Hou&s;hold, and
the like unavoidable I&s;&s;ues, upon Pre&s;umption that enough would come
in from this new Act of Parliament to be replaced to tho&s;e Purpo&s;es, be|fore
the Time that would require it &s;hould come. But by this <HI>Provi&s;o</HI>
e&s;pecial Care was taken, that none of the Money that &s;hould be rai&s;ed
<MILESTONE N="50">&s;hould be applied to the Payment of any Debt that was contracted before
the Royal A&s;&s;ent was given to the Bill: So that both the Money lent by
the Bankers upon the Promi&s;e made to them mu&s;t be unpaid and un&s;e|cured,
and the Money that had been &s;upplied from other A&s;&s;ignations
<PB N="320" REF="324">
mu&s;t not be applied to the original U&s;e; by which the Army and Hou&s;|hold
would be unprovided for, the Inconvenience whereof had no Need of
an Enlargement.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;BESIDES that the Bankers had the King's Word, and the Engagement
of the Mini&s;ters of the Revenue, that all new Bills of Supply &s;hould &s;till
make good what former Securities were not &s;ufficient to do; as by this
heavy Vi&s;itation of the Plague, the A&s;&s;ignations which had been made
upon the Exci&s;e and Chimney-Money, and by the Decay of Trade that
the War and Sickne&s;s together had produced, the A&s;&s;ignations made upon
the Cu&s;toms, had brought in &s;o little Money, that the Debt to the<MILESTONE N="10">
Bankers, which but for tho&s;e Ob&s;tructions might by this Time have been
much abated, remained &s;till very little le&s;s than it was near a Year be|fore.
And when it &s;hould be known, that this Sum of Money that was
to be rai&s;ed was exempt from the Payment of any of tho&s;e and the like
Debts, it would be a great Heartbreaking to all tho&s;e, who had not only
lent all their own E&s;tates, but the whole E&s;tates of many thou&s;ands of
other Men, to the King, and mu&s;t expect to be called upon by all who
have tru&s;ted them for their Money, which by this Invention They have
no Means to pay: And for the future, let the Nece&s;&s;ities be what they
will that the Crown may be involved in, there is no Hope of borrowing<MILESTONE N="20">
any Money, &s;ince it is not in the Power of the King him&s;elf to make any
A&s;&s;ignment upon this new Impo&s;ition.&endq;</P>
<P>VERY much of this had been &s;o ab&s;olutely unthought of by the King,
that He was very much troubled at it; and He had in his own Judgment
a ju&s;t E&s;teem of the Bankers, and looked upon any Prejudice that They
&s;hould &s;uffer as hurtful to him&s;elf, and a great Violation of his Honour and
Ju&s;tice. But it was plain enough that the principal De&s;ign of the Contrivers
was to prejudice the Bankers, nor did They care what Ruin befell them,
and &s;o talked loo&s;ely and bitterly &startq;of their cozening the King, and what
ill Bargains had been made with them;&endq; though it was made manife&s;t,<MILESTONE N="30">
that no private Gentleman in <HI>England</HI> did upon any real or per&s;onal Secu|rity
borrow Money, but con&s;idering the Brocage He pays, and the often
renewing his Security, it co&s;ts him yearly much more than the King paid
to the Bankers.</P>
<P>THEY &s;lighted what was pa&s;t as &s;ufficiently provided for; and for the
future confidently undertook the King &s;hould never more have Need of the
Bankers, &startq;for that this Act would be no &s;ooner pa&s;&s;ed, but upon the
Credit of it Money would be poured into the Exchequer fa&s;ter than it
could be told.&endq; And when They were told, &startq;that Expectation would
deceive them, and that great Sums would not come in, and &s;mall Sums<MILESTONE N="40">
would do Hurt, becau&s;e they would but &s;top up the Security from
giving Satisfaction to others, becau&s;e whatever was fir&s;t paid in mu&s;t be
fir&s;t paid:&endq; All this was an&s;wered confidently, &startq;that va&s;t Sums were
ready to their Knowledge to be paid in as &s;oon as the Bill &s;hould pa&s;s;&endq;
which fell out as was foretold. For after ten or twenty thou&s;and Pounds
were delivered in by them&s;elves and their Friends to &s;ave their Credit, there
was no more Money like to come; and that Sum did more Harm than
Good, by interrupting the Security.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding all their An&s;wers, the King remained un&s;atisfied in
many Particulars which He had not fore&s;een, and wi&s;hed &startq;that the Matter<MILESTONE N="50">
had been better con&s;ulted;&endq; and confe&s;&s;ed &startq;that <HI>Downing</HI> had not an|&s;wered
many of the Objections;&endq; and wi&s;hed &startq;that Alterations might be
prepared to be offered in the Hou&s;e of Peers as Amendments, and tran&s;|mitted
<PB N="321" REF="325">
to the Commons, without ca&s;ting out the <HI>Provi&s;o;</HI>&endq; the Founda|tion
and End of which &s;till plea&s;ed him for tho&s;e Rea&s;ons which He would
not communicate, and for which only it ought to have been rejected. But
as it had been very ea&s;y to have had it quite left out, which was the only
proper Remedy; &s;o the mending it would leave much Argument for De|bate,
and would &s;pend much Time. And it was to be apprehended, that
there were &s;o many of the be&s;t affected Members of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons
gone out of the Town as having no more to do, that when it &s;hould
be &s;ent down thither again, it might be longer delayed there than would
<MILESTONE N="10">be convenient for the Publick; and &s;o the Parliament be kept longer from
a Prorogation, than would be grateful to them or agreeable to the King.</P>
<P>AND therefore upon the whole Matter his Maje&s;ty cho&s;e that no Inter|ruption
&s;hould be given to it in the Hou&s;e of Peers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">It is pa&s;&s;ed by the Lords.</NOTE> and only &s;uch &s;mall
Amendments, which would be as &s;oon con&s;ented to in Both Hou&s;es as
read, &s;hould be offered, rather than run the other Hazard of Delay: And
&s;o accordingly it was pa&s;&s;ed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment pro|rogued.</NOTE> and upon the doing thereof, the Parliament
was prorogued to <HI>April</HI> following.</P>
<P>IN this Debate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King much offend|ed with the Chancellor in this Affair.</NOTE> upon the in&s;olent Behaviour of <HI>Downing</HI> in the De|fence
of that which could not be defended, and it may be out of the Ex|tremity
<MILESTONE N="20">of the Pain which at that Time He endured in his Bed, the Chan|cellor
had given &s;ome very &s;harp Reprehen&s;ions to <HI>Downing,</HI> for his Pre|&s;umption
in undertaking to &s;et &s;uch a De&s;ign on Foot that concerned the
whole Fabrick of the Exchequer (in which He was an inferiour Officer),
and &s;uch a Branch of the King's Revenue, without fir&s;t communicating it
to his &s;uperiour Officers and receiving their Advice; and told him, &startq;that
it was impo&s;&s;ible for the King to be well &s;erved, whil&s;t Fellows of his
Condition were admitted to &s;peak as much as They had a Mind to;
and that in the be&s;t Times &s;uch Pre&s;umptions had been puni&s;hed with Im|pri&s;onment
by the Lords of the Council, without the King's taking Notice
<MILESTONE N="30">of it:&endq; Which, with what Sharpne&s;s &s;oever uttered (in which He natu|rally
exceeded in &s;uch Occa&s;ions), in a Ca&s;e of this Nature, in which
with Reference to any Di&s;re&s;pect towards him&s;elf He was not concerned,
He thought did not exceed the Privilege and Dignity of the Place He
held; and for which there were many Precedents in the pa&s;t Times.</P>
<P>AT the pre&s;ent there was no Notice taken, nor Reply made to what
He &s;aid. But They who knew them&s;elves equally guilty, and believed
They were reflected upon, found quickly Opportunity to incen&s;e the King,
and to per&s;uade him to believe, &startq;that the Chancellor's Behaviour was a
greater Affront to him than to <HI>Downing:</HI> That a Servant &s;hould undergo
<MILESTONE N="40">&s;uch Reproaches in the King's own Pre&s;ence, for no other Rea&s;on but
having with all Humility pre&s;ented an Information to his Maje&s;ty, which
was natural for him to under&s;tand in the Office in which He &s;erved him,
and afterwards followed and ob&s;erved the Orders and Directions which
him&s;elf had pre&s;cribed; that this mu&s;t terrify all Men from giving the
King any Light in his Affairs, that He may know Nothing of his own
neare&s;t Concernments but what his chief Mini&s;ters thought fit to impart
to him.&endq; All which, and what&s;oever el&s;e was natural to Wit &s;harpened
with Malice to &s;ugge&s;t upon &s;uch an Argument, They enforced with
Warmth that They de&s;ired might be taken for Zeal for his Service and
<MILESTONE N="50">Dignity, which was pro&s;tituted by tho&s;e Pre&s;umptions of the Chancellor.</P>
<P>AND herewith They &s;o inflamed the King that He was much offended,
and expre&s;&s;ed to them &s;uch a Di&s;like that plea&s;ed them well, and gave
them Opportunity to add more Fewel to the Fire; and told them, &startq;that
<PB N="322" REF="326">
the Chancellor &s;hould find that He was not plea&s;ed,&endq; as indeed He did by
a greater Re&s;ervedne&s;s in his Countenance than his Maje&s;ty u&s;ed to carry to|wards
him; the Rea&s;on whereof his Innocence kept him from comprehend|ing,
till in a &s;hort Time He vouch&s;afed plainly to put him in Mind of his
Behaviour at that Time, and to expre&s;s a great Re&s;entment of it, and urged
all tho&s;e Glo&s;&s;es which had been made to him upon it, and &startq;what Inter|pretation
all Men mu&s;t make of &s;uch an Action, and be terrified by it
from offering any Thing, of what Importance &s;oever to his Service, if it
would offend his Mini&s;ters;&endq; and all this in a Choler very unnatural to
him, which exceedingly troubled the Chancellor, and made him more di&s;|cern,<MILESTONE N="10">
though He had Evidence enough of it before, that He &s;tood upon
very &s;lippery Ground.</P>
<P>HE told his Maje&s;ty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel|lor &s;atisfies his Maje&s;ty.</NOTE> &startq;that &s;ince He thought his Behaviour to be &s;o bad
in that Particular, for which till then his own Con&s;cience or Di&s;cretion
had not reproached him, He mu&s;t and did believe He had committed
a great Fault, for which He did humbly a&s;k his Pardon; and promi&s;ed
hereafter no more to incur his Di&s;plea&s;ure for &s;uch Exce&s;&s;es, which He

that any Body could have Credit enough with him to per&s;uade him to
believe, that He de&s;ired that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould not have a clear View,
and the mo&s;t di&s;cerning In&s;ight, into the darke&s;t and mo&s;t intricate
Parts of all his Affairs, which They knew in their Con&s;ciences to be
mo&s;t untrue. And He mu&s;t with great Confidence appeal to his Ma|je&s;ty,
who knew how much He had de&s;ired, and taken &s;ome Pains,
that his Maje&s;ty might never &s;et his Hand to any Thing, before He fully
under&s;tood it upon &s;uch References and Reports, as, according to the
Nature of the Bu&s;ine&s;s, were to be for his full Information.&endq;</P>
<P>HE be&s;ought him to remember &startq;how often He had told him, <HI>that it was<MILESTONE N="30">
mo&s;t ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that He &s;hould make him&s;elf entirely Ma&s;ter of his own
Bu&s;ine&s;s, for that there would be no Acquie&s;cence in any Judgment but his own;</HI>
and that his Maje&s;ty knew with what Boldne&s;s He had often lamented to
him&s;elf, <HI>that He would not take the Pains perfectly to under&s;tand all his
own Affairs, which expo&s;ed his Mini&s;ters to the Cen&s;ures of half-witted Men,
and was the greate&s;t Di&s;couragement to all who &s;erved him hone&s;tly:</HI> And
He de&s;ired his Pardon again for &s;aying that. He would hereafter find that
They who had advi&s;ed him in this late Tran&s;action, in the handling
whereof He had taken the Liberty that had offended his Maje&s;ty, had but
a very dim In&s;ight into that Bu&s;ine&s;s which They took upon them&s;elves<MILESTONE N="40">
to direct.&endq;</P>
<P>BUT his Maje&s;ty was not willing to enter again into that Di&s;cour&s;e, and
concluded with forbidding him to believe, &startq;that it was or could be in any
Mens Power to make him &s;u&s;pect his Affection or Integrity to his Ser|vice,&endq;
and u&s;ed many other very gracious Expre&s;&s;ions to him, nor ever
after &s;eemed to remember that Action to his Prejudice. But within a &s;hort
Time the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Sali&s;bury</HI> becoming void by the never enough la|mented
Death of Dr. <HI>Earle,</HI> his Maje&s;ty conferred that Bi&s;hoprick upon Dr.
<HI>Hyde,</HI> the Dean of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> upon the Chancellor's Recommendation,
who&s;e near Kin&s;man He was. Nor was his Credit with the King thought<MILESTONE N="50">
to be le&s;&s;ened by any Body but him&s;elf, who knew more to that Purpo&s;e
than other People could do: Yet He judged more from the Credit that
He found his Enemies got every Day, than from the King's withdrawing
<PB N="323" REF="327">
his Tru&s;t and Kindne&s;s from him; nor did the King believe that They had
then that De&s;ign again&s;t him, which &s;hortly after They did not di&s;&s;emble.</P>
<P>THE Purpo&s;e of making the Alteration in the Government of the Trea|&s;ury
was pur&s;ued very indu&s;triou&s;ly.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King per|&s;uaded to de&s;ire the Trea&s;urer would re&s;ign.</NOTE> And &s;ince that <HI>Provi&s;o</HI> with all the
Circum&s;tances thereof had not produced the Effect They propo&s;ed, for
They had believed that the Indignity of the Affront would have wrought
&s;o far upon the great Heart of the Trea&s;urer, that He would thereupon have
given up his Staff; which He was too much inclined to have done, if He
had not been prevailed with by tho&s;e who He knew were his Friends, not to
<MILESTONE N="10">gratify tho&s;e who de&s;ired him out of their Way, in doing that which They
of all Things wi&s;hed: Therefore that Plot not &s;ucceeding, They per|&s;uaded
the King to try another Expedient. For They all knew, that it was
too envious a Thing for his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf to remove him from his Office
by any Act of his, and that it would be loudly imputed to them. But if
He could be him&s;elf per&s;uaded to quit that which every Body knew He was
weary of, it would prevent all Inconveniences: And They had been told
that the Chancellor only had di&s;&s;uaded him from doing it, which He would
not pre&s;ume to do, if He were clearly told that the King de&s;ired that He
&s;hould give it up.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20">HEREUPON the King one Day called the Chancellor to him, and told him,
&startq;that He mu&s;t &s;peak with him in a Bu&s;ine&s;s of great Confidence, and which
required great Secrecy;&endq; and then enlarged in a great Commendation of the
Trea&s;urer (whom in Truth He did very much e&s;teem), &startq;of his great Parts
of Judgment, of his unque&s;tionable Integrity, and of his general Intere&s;t and
Reputation throughout the Kingdom. But with all this&endq; He &s;aid &startq;He was
not fit for the Office He held: That He did not under&s;tand the My&s;tery
of that Place, nor could in his Nature go through with the nece&s;&s;ary Obli|gations
of it. That his bodily Infirmities were &s;uch, that many Times
He could not be &s;poken with for two or three Days, &s;o that there could
<MILESTONE N="30">be no Di&s;patch; of which every Body complained, and by which his Bu|&s;ine&s;s
&s;uffered very much. That all Men knew that all the Bu&s;ine&s;s was
done by Sir <HI>Philip Warwick,</HI> whom, though He was a very hone&s;t Man,
He did not think fit to be Trea&s;urer; which He was to all Effects, the
Trea&s;urer him&s;elf doing Nothing but &s;igning the Papers which the other
prepared for him, which was neither for the King's Honour nor his.&endq;
The Truth was, that his Under&s;tanding was too fine for &s;uch gro&s;s Matters
as that Office mu&s;t be conver&s;ant about, and that if his Want of Health did
not hinder him, his Genius did not carry him that Way; nor would the
Lazine&s;s of his Nature permit him to take that Pains, that was ab&s;olutely
<MILESTONE N="40">nece&s;&s;ary for the well di&s;charging that great Office.</P>
<P>HIS Maje&s;ty concluded, &startq;that He loved him too well to di&s;oblige him,
and would never do any Thing that would not be grateful to him: But
He had &s;ome Rea&s;on, even from what He had &s;ometimes &s;aid to him, to
think that He was weary of it, and might be ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to deliver
up his Staff, which his Maje&s;ty would be very glad of; and therefore
He wi&s;hed that He,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King wi&s;h|es the Chan|cellor to advi&s;e him to it.</NOTE> the Chancellor, who was known to have mo&s;t In|tere&s;t
in him, would per&s;uade him to it, in which He would do his
Maje&s;ty a &s;ingular Service.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Chancellor pre&s;ently a&s;ked him, &startq;if He were &s;o unfit, whom
<MILESTONE N="50">He would make Trea&s;urer in his Room.&endq; The King as pre&s;ently an|&s;wered,
&startq;that He would never make another Trea&s;urer, which was an Of|fice
of great Charge, and would be much more effectually executed by
Commi&s;&s;ioners; which had been done in <HI>Cromwell's</HI> Time, as many
<PB N="324" REF="328">
Offices had been: And that his Maje&s;ty found by Experience, that in
Offices of that Kind Commi&s;&s;ioners were better than &s;ingle Officers; for
though Sir <HI>William Compton</HI> was a very extraordinary Man, of great In|du&s;try
and Fidelity, yet that the Office of the Ordnance was neither in &s;o
good Order nor &s;o thri&s;tily managed whil&s;t He was Ma&s;ter of it, as it hath
been &s;ince his Death, &s;ince when it hath been governed by Commi&s;&s;ioners;
and &s;o He was well a&s;&s;ured his Trea&s;ury would be.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Chancellor replied, &startq;that He was very &s;orry to find his Maje&s;ty &s;o
much inclined to Commi&s;&s;ioners, who were indeed fitte&s;t to execute all
Offices according to the Model of a Commonwealth, but not at all agree|able<MILESTONE N="10">
to Monarchy: That if He thought the Precedent of <HI>Cromwell's</HI> Time
fit to be followed, He &s;hould be in the Po&s;ture that <HI>Cromwell</HI> was, with
an Army of one hundred thou&s;and Men, which made him have no Need
of the Authority and Reputation of a Trea&s;urer, either to &s;ettle his Re|venue
or to direct the levying it; He could do Both be&s;t him&s;elf.&endq; But
He very pa&s;&s;ionately be&s;ought his Maje&s;ty to believe, &startq;that They who ad|vi&s;ed
him to this Method of Government, though They might have good
Affection to his Per&s;on and his Service, were very un&s;kilful in the Con|&s;titution
of this Kingdom and in the Nature of the People. That the
Office of Trea&s;urer had &s;ometimes upon the Death of a pre&s;ent Officer<MILESTONE N="20">
been executed by Commi&s;&s;ioners, but very &s;eldom for any Time, or
longer than whil&s;t the King could deliberately make Choice of a fit Mi|ni&s;ter.
That him&s;elf had been twice a Commi&s;&s;ioner for the Trea&s;ury,
once in the Time of his Father, and again upon his Maje&s;ty's Return:
And therefore that He could upon Experience a&s;&s;ure him, that Commi&s;|&s;ioners,
in &s;o active a Time as this, could never di&s;charge the Duty of that
Office; and that the Dignity of the Per&s;on of the Trea&s;urer was mo&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for his Service, both towards the procuring the rai&s;ing of Money in
Parliament, and the improving his Revenue by the Grant of Additions
there, as likewi&s;e for the collecting and conducting it afterwards. For the<MILESTONE N="30">
pre&s;ent Trea&s;urer,&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;there was no Que&s;tion but if He knew that
his Maje&s;ty was weary of his Service, and wi&s;hed to have the Staff out of
his Hand, He would mo&s;t readily deliver it: But that They who gave the
Coun&s;el, and thought it fit for his Maje&s;ty's Service, were much fitter
to give him that Adverti&s;ement, than He who in his Con&s;cience did be|lieve,
that the following it would be of the mo&s;t pernicious Con&s;equence
to his Service of any Thing that could be done.&endq;</P>
<P>HE mo&s;t humbly and with much Earne&s;tne&s;s be&s;ought his Maje&s;ty
&s;eriou&s;ly to reflect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel|lor earne&s;tly petitions him again&s;t this Mea&s;ure.</NOTE> what an ill Savour it would have over the whole
Kingdom, at this Time of a War with at lea&s;t two powerful Enemies<MILESTONE N="40">
abroad together, of &s;o great Di&s;content and Jealou&s;y at Home, and
when the Court was in no great Reputation with the People, to re|move
a Per&s;on the mo&s;t loved and reverenced by the People for his mo&s;t
exemplary Fidelity and Wi&s;dom, who had de&s;erved as much from his
ble&s;&s;ed Father and him&s;elf as a Subject can do from his Prince, a No|bleman
of the be&s;t Quality, the be&s;t allied and the be&s;t beloved; to re|move
at &s;uch a Time &s;uch a Per&s;on and with &s;uch Circum&s;tances from
his Councils and his Tru&s;t: For Nobody could imagine, that, after &s;uch
a Manife&s;tation of his Maje&s;ty's Di&s;plea&s;ure, He would be again conver|&s;ant
in the Court or in the Council, Both which would be much le&s;s<MILESTONE N="50">
e&s;teemed upon &s;uch an Action. That many with the &s;ame Di&s;ea&s;es and
Infirmities had long executed that Office, which required more the Strength
<PB N="325" REF="329">
of the Mind than of the Body: All were obliged to attend him, and He
only to wait upon his Maje&s;ty.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;THAT it was impo&s;&s;ible for any Man to di&s;charge that Office without
a Secretary: And if the whole Kingdom had been to have preferred a Se|cretary
to him, They would have commended this Gentleman to him
whom He tru&s;ted, who had for many Years &s;erved a former Trea&s;urer in
the &s;ame Tru&s;t, in the mo&s;t malignant, captious and calumniating Time
that hath been known, and yet without the lea&s;t Blemi&s;h or Imputation;
and who, ever &s;ince that Time, had &s;erved his Father in and to the End
<MILESTONE N="10">of the War, and him&s;elf &s;ince in the mo&s;t &s;ecret and dangerous Affairs&endq;
(for He had been tru&s;ted by the Per&s;ons of the greate&s;t Quality to hold In|telligence
with his Maje&s;ty to the Time of his Return); &startq;&s;o that all Men
rather expected to have found him preferred to &s;ome good Place, than
in the &s;ame Po&s;t He had been in twenty Years before; which He would
never have undertaken under any other Officer than one with whom He
had much Confidence, and who He knew would &s;erve his Maje&s;ty &s;o well.
Yet,&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;that whoever knew them could never believe that Sir
<HI>Philip Warwick</HI> could govern the Lord Trea&s;urer.&endq;</P>
<P>THE King &s;aid, &startq;He had a very good Opinion of Sir <HI>Philip Warwick,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="20">and had never heard any Thing to his Prejudice.&endq; But upon the main
Point of the Debate He &s;eemed rather moved and troubled than convinced,
when by good Fortune the Duke of <HI>York</HI> came into the Room, who had
been well prepared to like the King's Purpo&s;e and to believe it nece&s;&s;ary;
and therefore his Maje&s;ty was glad of his Pre&s;ence, and called him to him,
and told him what He had been &s;peaking of; and the Chancellor informed
him of all that had pa&s;&s;ed between the King and him, and told him, &startq;that
He could never do a better Service to the King his Brother, than by
u&s;ing his Credit with him to re&s;train him from pro&s;ecuting a Purpo&s;e that
would prove &s;o mi&s;chievous to him.&endq; And &s;o the Di&s;cour&s;e was renewed:
<MILESTONE N="30">And in the End the Duke was &s;o entirely converted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And at length prevails.</NOTE> that He prevailed with
his Maje&s;ty to lay a&s;ide the Thought of it; which &s;o broke all the Mea&s;ures
the other Contrivers had formed their Coun&s;els by, that They were much
out of Countenance. But finding that They could not work upon the
Duke to change his Mind, and to return to the former Re&s;olution, They
thought not fit to pre&s;s the King farther for the pre&s;ent; and only made &s;o
much U&s;e of their Want of Succe&s;s, by pre&s;enting to his Maje&s;ty his Irre&s;o|lutene&s;s,
which made the Chancellor &s;till impo&s;e upon him, that the King
did not think the better of the Chancellor or the Trea&s;urer, for his receding
at that Time from pro&s;ecuting what He had &s;o po&s;itively re&s;olved to have
<MILESTONE N="40">done, and promi&s;ed them &startq;to be firmer to his next Determination.&endq;</P>
<P>AFTER <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> the Rage and Fury of the Pe&s;tilence began in &s;ome De|gree
to be mitigated, but &s;o little, that Nobody who had left the Town
had yet the Courage to return thither: Nor had They Rea&s;on; for though it
was a con&s;iderable Abatement from the Height it had been at, yet there died
&s;till between three and four thou&s;and in the Week, and of tho&s;e, &s;ome Men
of better Condition than had fallen before. The General writ from thence,
that there &s;till aro&s;e new Difficulties in providing for the &s;etting out the
Fleet, and &s;ome of &s;uch a Nature, that He could not ea&s;ily remove them
without Communication with his Maje&s;ty, and receiving his more po&s;itive
<MILESTONE N="50">Directions; and how to bring that to pa&s;s He knew not, for as He could
by no Means advi&s;e his Maje&s;ty to leave <HI>Oxford,</HI> &s;o He found many Ob|jections
again&s;t his own being ab&s;ent from <HI>London.&endq; Wind&s;or</HI> was thought
upon as a Place where the King might &s;afely re&s;ide, there being then no
<PB N="326" REF="330">
Infection there: But the King had adjourned the Term thither, which had
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the whole Town; and He was not without &s;ome Apprehen&s;ion,
that the Plague had got into one Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>IN the End,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King re|moves from</HI> Oxford <HI>to</HI> Hampton-Court.</NOTE> towards the End of <HI>February,</HI> the King re&s;olved that the
Queen and Dutche&s;s and all their Families &s;hould remain in <HI>Oxford;</HI> and
that his Maje&s;ty and his Brother, with Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> and &s;uch of his Coun|cil

Journey to <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> where the General might be every Day and

requi&s;ite for the carrying on his Service, and &s;o after two or three Days<MILESTONE N="10">

that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould re&s;ide longer there, than the Di&s;patch of the
mo&s;t important Bu&s;ine&s;s required: And with this Re&s;olution his Maje&s;ty
made his Journey to <HI>Hampton-Court.</HI></P>
<P>IT plea&s;ed God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Plague decrea&s;es.</NOTE> that the next Week after his Maje&s;ty came thither, the
Number of tho&s;e who died of the Plague in the City decrea&s;ed one thou|&s;and;
and there was a &s;trange univer&s;al Joy there for the King's being &s;o
near. The Weather was as it could be wi&s;hed, deep Snow and terrible
Fro&s;t, which very probably &s;topped the &s;preading of the Infection, though
it might put an End to tho&s;e who were already infected, as it did, for in<MILESTONE N="20">
a Week or two the Number of the Dead was very little dimini&s;hed. The
General came and went as was intended: But the Bu&s;ine&s;s every Day in|crea&s;ed;
and his Maje&s;ty's Remove to a farther Di&s;tance was thought in|convenient,
&s;ince there appeared no Danger in remaining where He was.</P>
<P>AND after a Fortnight's or three Weeks Stay,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King returns to</HI> Whitehall.</NOTE> He re&s;olved, for the quicker
Di&s;patch of all that was to be done, to go to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> when there died
above fifteen hundred in the Week, and when there was not in a Day &s;een
a Coach in the Streets, but tho&s;e which came in his Maje&s;ty's Train; &s;o
much all Men were terrified from returning to a Place of &s;o much Mor|tality.
Yet it can hardly be imagined, what Numbers flocked thither from<MILESTONE N="30">
all Parts upon the Fame of the King's being at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> all Men being
a&s;hamed of their Fears for their own Safety, when the King ventured his
Per&s;on. The Judges at <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> adjourned the la&s;t Return of the Term to
<HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI> and the Town every Day filled marvellou&s;ly; and which
was more wonderful, the Plague every Day decrea&s;ed. Upon which the
King changed his Purpo&s;e, and in&s;tead of returning to <HI>Oxford,</HI> &s;ent for the
Queen and all the Family to come to <HI>Whitehall:</HI> So that before the End
of <HI>March</HI> the Streets were as full, the <HI>Exchange</HI> as much crowded, and the
People in all Places as numerous, as They had ever been &s;een, few Per&s;ons
mi&s;&s;ing any of their Acquaintance, though by the weekly Bills there ap|peared<MILESTONE N="40">
to have died above one hundred and three&s;core thou&s;and Per&s;ons:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Number &s;uppo&s;ed to have died of the Plague.</NOTE>
And many, who could compute very well, concluded that there were in
Truth double that Number who died; and that in one Week, when the
Bill mentioned only &s;ix thou&s;and, there had in Truth fourteen thou&s;and
died. The frequent Deaths of the Clerks and Sextons of Pari&s;hes hindered
the exact Account of every Week; but that which left it without any
Certainty was the va&s;t Number that was buried in the Fields, of which no
Account was kept. Then of the <HI>Anabapti&s;ts</HI> and other Secta$$$s, who
abounded in the City, very few left their Habitations; and Multitudes of
them died, whereof no Church-warden or other Officer had Notice; but<MILESTONE N="50">
They found Burials, according to their own Fancies, in &s;mall Gardens or the
next Fields. The greate&s;t Number of tho&s;e who died con&s;i&s;ted of Women
and Children, and the lowe&s;t and poore&s;t Sort of the People: So that, as I
<PB N="327" REF="331">
&s;aid before, few Men mi&s;&s;ed any of their Acquaintance when They returned,
not many of Wealth or Quality or of much Conver&s;ation being dead; yet
&s;ome of either Sort there were.</P>
<P>THE Bu&s;ine&s;s of the King and of all about him was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Preparations for &s;etting out the Fleet a|gain.</NOTE> that the Fleet might
be ready and at Sea with all the po&s;&s;ible Expedition: And in or towards this
there was le&s;s Di&s;turbance and Interruption than could rea&s;onably have been
expected, an univer&s;al Cheerfulne&s;s appearing in all who could ob&s;truct or
contribute towards it, the People generally being abundantly &s;atisfied in the
King's Choice of the Commanders. Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> was very much beloved,
<MILESTONE N="10">for his confe&s;&s;ed Courage, by the Seamen; and the People believed that They
could not but have the Victory where the General commanded, who only
underwent Unquietne&s;s and Vexation from the tempe&s;tuous Humour of his
Wife. She, from his Return from <HI>Oxford,</HI> and from the Time that She
had the fir&s;t Intimation that the King had de&s;igned her Hu&s;band for the
Command of the Fleet, was all Storm and Fury; and, according to the
Wi&s;dom and Mode&s;ty of her Nature, poured out a thou&s;and full-mouthed
Cur&s;es again&s;t all tho&s;e who had contributed to that Coun&s;el: But the Ma|lice$
of all that Tempe&s;t fell upon the Chancellor. She declared, &startq;that
this was a Plot of his to remove her Hu&s;band from the King, that He
<MILESTONE N="20">might do what He had a Mind to;&endq; and threw all the ill Words at him
which She had been accu&s;tomed to hear, accompanied with her good Wi&s;hes
of what She would have befall him. But the Company She kept, and the
Conver&s;ation She was accu&s;tomed to, could not propagate the Reproaches
far; and the poor General him&s;elf felt them mo&s;t, who knew the Chan|cellor
to be his very fa&s;t and faithful Friend, and that He would not be le&s;s
&s;o becau&s;e his Wife was no wi&s;er than She was born to be. He was inde|fatigable
in taking Pains Night and Day, that the Fleet might be at Sea.</P>
<P>THE Duke of <HI>Beaufort,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> French <HI>Fleet pre|pared.</HI></NOTE> Admiral of <HI>France,</HI> was already gone to <HI>Bre&s;t,</HI>

<P>THE Rupture was declared on Both Sides with <HI>Denmark.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Denmark <HI>joins the</HI> Dutch.</NOTE> That King

according to his Engagement. But the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Re&s;ident in <HI>Sweden</HI> delayed
to conclude, and pretended to have received le&s;s po&s;itive Orders than the
Nature of the Affair required, and that He expected fuller: And &s;o all
Matters were deferred, till Amba&s;&s;adours came from <HI>Holland</HI> with no Ex|po&s;tulations,
and a De&s;ire to renew their Alliance, and relea&s;e &s;ome Engage|ments
<MILESTONE N="50">They had upon the <HI>Sound,</HI> which had been very grievous to the
<HI>Dane;</HI> and many other Conditions were granted which were very conve|nient
to them. An Amba&s;&s;adour likewi&s;e arrived in the Nick of Time from
<HI>France,</HI> to di&s;po&s;e them to a Conjunction with <HI>Holland,</HI> and to warrant
<PB N="328" REF="332">
the Performance of what&s;oever the <HI>Hollander</HI> &s;hould promi&s;e, and likewi&s;e
to undertake that <HI>France</HI> would protect them again&s;t <HI>England,</HI> and there|fore
that They &s;hould not apprehend any Danger from a War from thence;
and <HI>De Ruyter</HI> was now gone with the Fleet for <HI>Bergen.</HI></P>
<P>UPON all the&s;e Motives concurring in the &s;ame Conjuncture, the poor
King embraced that Party; and then declared and complained, &startq;that the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had broken the Law of Nations in violating the Peace of his Ports,
and endeavouring to fire his Town, when They were ho&s;pitably received and
treated there under the Protection of his Ca&s;tle.&endq; He denied that He
had ever made &s;uch an Offer or Promi&s;e as Sir <HI>Gilbert Talbot</HI> &s;till charged<MILESTONE N="10">
him with, and which He had not denied to Mr. <HI>Clifford</HI> when He came
fir&s;t thither. But now He reproached Sir <HI>Gilbert Talbot</HI> &startq;for fal&s;ifying his
Words, at lea&s;t for mi&s;taking them, and &s;ending that to the King his Ma&s;ter
which He gave him no Liberty to do.&endq; And now Sir <HI>Gilbert</HI> found his
Errour in not having drawn from him or his Servant <HI>Gabell,</HI> in Writing,
&s;ome Evidence of the Engagement: But after many Indignities He left the
Court and returned to <HI>England.</HI> All <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships in <HI>Denmark</HI> or <HI>Nor|way</HI>
were &s;eized upon; and the Per&s;ons of all Merchants and others who
were his Maje&s;ty's Subjects, and to &s;ome of whom the King of <HI>Denmark</HI>
owed great Sums of Money which They had lent to him, were impri&s;oned,<MILESTONE N="20">
and their Goods &s;eized and confi&s;cated.</P>
<P>ALL which Proceedings provoked the King to give the like Orders, and
to look upon them as Enemies, and to emit a Declaration of the Motive
He had to &s;end his Fleet to <HI>Bergen,</HI> &startq;which He could never have done
but upon the Invitation and Promi&s;e of that King; which was evident
enough by the Reception his Ships had there, and Expectation the Gover|nour
had of their Arrival, and his Allegation, <HI>that He expected that very
Night fuller Orders than He had yet received;</HI> and la&s;tly, his &s;uffering
them to depart &s;ecurely, after all the Acts of Ho&s;tility had pa&s;&s;ed in the
Port.&endq; Much of this was denied with many indecent Expre&s;&s;ions, and<MILESTONE N="30">
&s;uch Eva&s;ions as made all that was &s;aid believed by equal Con&s;iderers: And

<P>AND then in the Beginning of the Year 1666, a Year long de&s;tined by
all A&s;trologers for the Production of di&s;mal Changes and Alterations through|out
the World, and by &s;ome for the End of it, the King found his Condition
&s;o much wor&s;e than it had been the la&s;t Year, as the Addition of <HI>France</HI>
and <HI>Denmark</HI> could make it; again&s;t all which, and the Prodigies which
the Year was to produce (and it did truly produce many), the King pre|pared

join with him, and had made Levies of Soldiers to that Purpo&s;e, having
abundant Argument of Quarrel with <HI>Holland,</HI> were now per&s;uaded by the
&s;ame Way not only to de&s;i&s;t from helping, but to declare them&s;elves Ene|mies

<MILESTONE N="20"><HI>Dutch</HI> with their Forces.&endq;</P>
<P>WHEN all this could not di&s;courage the Bi&s;hop from pro&s;ecuting his In|tention,

the Right that in Ju&s;tice He could demand from them, and if this were

had permitted Levies to be made in their Countries, &startq;that They &s;hould

<P>WHEN all this could not terrify the Bi&s;hop, who defended him&s;elf by his
Engagement to the King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> &startq;that He would not enter into
Treaty nor give over his Enterpri&s;e without his Con&s;ent,&endq; and drew his

of <HI>Ca&s;telle Roderigo,</HI> then Governour of <HI>Flanders,</HI> to make Levies in tho&s;e
<MILESTONE N="40">Provinces without Noi&s;e or avowing it, and marched with his Army into
the <HI>States</HI> Dominions, and took a Place or two even in the Sight of Prince
<HI>Maurice</HI> (who drew as many of the <HI>States</HI> Troops together as could be
&s;pared out of their Garri&s;ons, but thought not fit to engage with them, after
He had found in &s;ome light Skirmi&s;hes that They were not firm); &s;o that
the Bi&s;hop, by the Advantage of the Situation of which He was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed,
began to fa&s;ten him&s;elf in full A&s;&s;urance of increa&s;ing his Army, in Spite
of all Di&s;couragements, before the Spring (and He had already received
&s;ome Troops out of <HI>Flanders,</HI> and Adverti&s;ement from other of his Officers,
that They were well advanced in their Levies): The King of <HI>France</HI> in this
<MILESTONE N="50">Conjuncture, in the imperious Style He cu&s;tomarily u&s;ed in tho&s;e Ca&s;es, &s;ent
to the Governour of <HI>Flanders</HI> for a Licen&s;e for &s;uch Troops, as He had
Occa&s;ion to &s;end into <HI>Germany,</HI> to pa&s;s through &s;uch a Part of his Go|vernment;
which as He had no Mind to grant, &s;o He dur&s;t not deny,
<PB N="330" REF="334">
having Orders from <HI>Spain</HI> to be very careful, that no Di&s;gu&s;ts might be
given to <HI>France</HI> which might give any Occa&s;ion, or Pretence, or Opportunity
for a Breach, which They well knew was de&s;ired and longed for.</P>
<P>UPON this Permi&s;&s;ion the <HI>French</HI> Troops marched into <HI>Flanders:</HI> And in
the fir&s;t Place, whether in their Way or out of their Way, They fell upon
the Levies which were made for the Bi&s;hop, and routed and di&s;per&s;ed them,
or took them Pri&s;oners. In one Place, by the Strength of their Quarter
and a neighbour Church, They defended them&s;elves, imagining the Coun|try
would relieve them, without &s;u&s;pecting that They had Licen&s;e and Per|mi&s;&s;ion
to march through: But They were &s;o much inferiour in Number<MILESTONE N="10">
or Strength, that after &s;ome of them were killed, the re&s;t were glad to throw
down their Arms and become Pri&s;oners at Mercy, the Officers not compre|hending
what declared Enemy could fall upon them in tho&s;e Quarters.
With this Triumph They marched, and joined with Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> by the
Time the Bi&s;hop had Notice of the Di&s;a&s;ter, and &s;peedily advanced upon
his Quarters, and beat &s;ome of his Troops.</P>
<P>UPON which the poor Bi&s;hop (who in&s;tead of the Supplies and Commi&s;|&s;ions
and other Countenance that He had Rea&s;on to expect from tho&s;e
Princes, who had been privy and with great Promi&s;es encouraged his Enter|pri&s;e,
received every Day Arguments from them again&s;t his proceeding far|ther,<MILESTONE N="20">
with many Conjurations that He would entirely &s;ubmit to the King of
<HI>France</HI> his Determination) found him&s;elf nece&s;&s;itated to comply,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And at length force him to make a Peace with the</HI> Dutch.</NOTE> and even
heartbroken &s;igned a Treaty with the <HI>French,</HI> who then were careful enough
both of his Honour and Intere&s;t in the Conditions with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as for
an Ally of whom They meant to make more U&s;e in another Conjuncture.
Upon all which the Bi&s;hop had been much more excu&s;able, if He had
not received &s;ome of the King's Money, even after He &s;aw that He &s;hould
be obliged to &s;ign the Treaty; which He ought not to have done, though
it had been due, and it may be expended, before He had any &s;uch Inten|tion,
and to which it cannot be denied He had mo&s;t forcible Com|pul&s;ions.<MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>THIS was the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Blow, but the Plague, that the King had felt
from the Beginning of the War, and was In&s;tance enough how terrible the
King of <HI>France</HI> was to all the neighbour Kings and Princes, who had &s;o
&s;uddenly departed from their own Inclinations and Re&s;olutions and from
their own Intere&s;t, only upon his In&s;inuations, which became Orders to
them. And <HI>Spain,</HI> if They knew that which all the World be&s;ides di&s;|cerned,
could not but believe that <HI>France</HI> would break all Treaties as &s;oon
as the other King &s;hould die, the News of which was expected and pro|vided
for every Week. But the drow&s;y Temper of that Monarch, who
had been &s;o much di&s;quieted throughout his whole Reign, extended &s;o<MILESTONE N="40">
far only as to prepare a Stock of Peace that would la&s;t during his own
Time, that He &s;aw would be very &s;hort, and to leave his Dominions and
his infant Son to &s;hift for them&s;elves when He was dead: And it was an
unhappy Maxim of that State, that it was the be&s;t Hu&s;bandry to pur|cha&s;e
pre&s;ent Peace and pre&s;ent Money at how dear Intere&s;t &s;oever for the
future, which would be a&s;&s;i&s;ted with &s;ome new Expedients, as <HI>Spain</HI> had
always been.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e Di&s;advantages made the King the more &s;olicitous to have but
one Enemy to &s;truggle with,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King $word$ of $word$ with</HI> Holland <HI>a|gain&s;t</HI> France.</NOTE> though it were <HI>France:</HI> And therefore He
was very &s;olicitous by all Ways He could devi&s;e to make a Peace with <HI>Hol|land,</HI><MILESTONE N="50">
and to leave <HI>Denmark</HI> to their own Inventions; and He had &s;ome
Encouragement to believe, that it was not impo&s;&s;ible to &s;eparate <HI>Holland</HI>
<PB N="331" REF="335">
from <HI>France.</HI> They were &s;en&s;ible enough, that They had been upon the
Matter betrayed into the War, by the po&s;itive Promi&s;e of A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and a
firm Conjunction from <HI>France</HI> in the In&s;tant that the War &s;hould be en|tered
upon, without any Mention of Mediation or Interpo&s;ition for Peace,
which was again&s;t their De&s;ire; and that They had looked on very unconcern|edly,
or rather well plea&s;ed to &s;ee them beaten, and their own People ready to
ri&s;e again&s;t the Government.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Dutch <HI>jealous of</HI> France.</NOTE> Then They knew that <HI>France</HI> did already pro|vide
for an Expedition again&s;t <HI>Flanders,</HI> which could not long defend it&s;elf
with its own Forces; and that They depended upon this War between
<MILESTONE N="10"><HI>England</HI> and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as what mu&s;t hinder Both tho&s;e Nations from
giving it A&s;&s;i&s;tance: And They as well knew what their own Portion mu&s;t
be, when that Screen was removed, that was their be&s;t Security again&s;t &s;o
mighty a Neighbour. And this <HI>De Wit</HI> him&s;elf, who was the chief Sup|porter
of the War, frequently ob&s;erved and confe&s;&s;ed to tho&s;e with whom
He had mo&s;t Conver&s;ation, and in whom He was believed to have mo&s;t
Tru&s;t: And all tho&s;e Adverti&s;ements were tran&s;mitted to the King by tho&s;e
who&s;e Integrity could not be &s;u&s;pected, and who did not di&s;&s;emble, being of
the <HI>States</HI> them&s;elves, to be very de&s;irous of Peace and very jealous of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>THERE was a Gentleman,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Character of</HI> M. Bewett <HI>a Gentleman of great Weight in</HI> Holland.</NOTE> one <HI>Mon&s;ieur Bewett,</HI> of a good Family in
<MILESTONE N="20"><HI>France</HI> and born there, but long bred in <HI>Holland</HI> whil&s;t the Wars were
there, and who had been Captain in the la&s;t Prince of <HI>Orange's</HI> Hor&s;e-Guards,
and in very particular Favour with him, by which He was married to a
Woman of <HI>Holland</HI> very rich, and very nearly allied to many of tho&s;e who
had the greate&s;t Influence upon the Government; and who was now looked
upon rather as a <HI>Dutchman</HI> than a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> and conver&s;ed mo&s;t fami|liarly
among&s;t the <HI>Burgoma&s;ters,</HI> and other principal Per&s;ons of the <HI>States.</HI>
And by this Intere&s;t, after the Death of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> that Troop
was &s;till pre&s;erved for a Guard to the <HI>States,</HI> and was the only Hor&s;e-Troop
that remained con&s;tantly in the <HI>Hague.</HI> And for the better plea&s;ing the People,
<MILESTONE N="30">it was &s;till called the Prince of <HI>Orange's</HI> Guard, and continued to wear the
&s;ame Livery it had always done: And the young Prince took much De|light
to &s;ee them, and to hear him&s;elf called by them their Captain; and
the Commander thereof, <HI>Bewett,</HI> profe&s;&s;ed and paid the &s;ame Devotion to
him that He had done to his Father.</P>
<P>THIS Gentleman was generally beloved, and held a Man of great
Sincerity, brave in Point of Courage, and of good Parts of Wit and
Judgment, &s;ave that He was immoderately given to Wine and to the Ex|ce&s;s
of it, which, being the Di&s;ea&s;e or rather the Health of the Country,
made him not the wor&s;e thought of or le&s;s fit for Bu&s;ine&s;s. He was
<MILESTONE N="40">well known to the King and well thought of by him, and had great Fami|liarity
with &s;ome of the Bedchamber, and others near the King and tru&s;ted
by him. He had made a Journey once, &s;ince the King's Return into <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
only to ki&s;s his Hand, and profe&s;s the &s;ame Affection and Duty He
had often done when his Maje&s;ty was abroad, which had always made him
acceptable to him.</P>
<P>HE was a bold Speaker, and from the Time that the War was begun
again&s;t <HI>England</HI> much inveighed again&s;t the Coun&s;el that per&s;uaded it, as
very pernicious to the Affairs of that Country; and in this Argument u&s;ed
not more Freedom with any than with <HI>De Wit</HI> him&s;elf, who loved his Per|&s;on
<MILESTONE N="50">and his Spirit, and conver&s;ed very freely with him, though He knew
his Friend&s;hips were chiefly with the Dependents upon the Hou&s;e of <HI>Orange,</HI>
and with others of the <HI>States</HI> who were of his own Opinion with Reference
to the War: And the publi&s;hing his Opinion drew many of the greate&s;t In|tere&s;t
<PB N="332" REF="336">
among&s;t the <HI>Burgoma&s;ters</HI> to delight in his Conver&s;ation, and to tru&s;t
him much. With tho&s;e He con&s;ulted freely what Means &s;hould be u&s;ed to
procure a Peace, and prevent the Mi&s;chief that mu&s;t attend the Conti|nuance
of the War, with good Sen&s;e and Judgment: But tho&s;e Con&s;ulta|tions
were always in the Exerci&s;e of Drinking, which never ended without
the utmo&s;t Exce&s;s, though without Noi&s;e or Di&s;quiet or Unkindne&s;s, which
are never the Effects of tho&s;e Exce&s;&s;es among&s;t that People.</P>
<P>AFTER the fir&s;t Battle, when the <HI>Dutch</HI> were &s;o much beaten, and the
People in that Con&s;ternation that They called aloud for Peace, and reviled
all tho&s;e who were thought to be again&s;t it, and among&s;t tho&s;e <HI>De Wit</HI><MILESTONE N="10">
principally, who had the more Enemies, and Peace the more Friends, for
the Differences which had ari&s;en among&s;t the Officers of the Fleet upon the
Death of <HI>Opdam,</HI> and upon the Di&s;grace which <HI>Trump</HI> had undergone by
the Power and Inju&s;tice, as They &s;aid, of <HI>De Wit</HI> upon per&s;onal Di&s;likes,
and becau&s;e He was known to have great Affection for the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>
(and <HI>Van Trump</HI> him&s;elf, as hath been &s;aid, was not only of much Intere&s;t
among&s;t the Seamen, but very popular in the Government, and had his Si&s;|ters
married to <HI>Burgoma&s;ters</HI> in &s;ome of the greate&s;t Towns; &s;o that the
Di&s;grace of him increa&s;ed the Number of <HI>De Wit's</HI> Enemies): In this Con|juncture
<HI>Bewett</HI> cultivated the be&s;t He could all tho&s;e ill Humours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Endea|vours to bring about a Peace.</NOTE> how<MILESTONE N="20">
mutinous &s;oever, which grew mo&s;t importunate for Peace; yet without
any Reflection upon the Per&s;on of <HI>De Wit,</HI> with whom He was known by
the Company He mo&s;t kept to have much Familiarity, and whom He did
at that Time really believe to be inclined to Peace, and declared He did
think &s;o to tho&s;e who knew the contrary, yet did not think the wor&s;e of
him for being deceived, being a&s;&s;ured He would never deceive them for
Want of Integrity.</P>
<P>BUT He took Advantage of this general Di&s;temper and of the Prejudice
the People had again&s;t him, to talk very frankly to <HI>De Wit</HI> of Both; and
admired, &startq;&s;ince He did, as He profe&s;&s;ed, de&s;ire Peace, that He would not<MILESTONE N="30">
find &s;ome Way to undeceive the People, which was nece&s;&s;ary for his own
Security; and it might ea&s;ily be effected, by giving a Beginning to &s;uch
a Con&s;ultation as might look towards an Accommodation.&endq; <HI>De Wit</HI>
had his Spies in all Places, and knew well what Company <HI>Bewett</HI> mo&s;t de|lighted
in, though his Acquaintance was univer&s;al and agreeable to all Men:
And He was informed too of his particular Behaviour with Reference to
him, and that He did con&s;tantly and confidently vindicate him from many
Imputations, in the Pre&s;ence of tho&s;e who were not plea&s;ed with his Contra|dictions;
&s;o that He looked upon him as his Friend, and one that might by
his Intere&s;t and Credit divert &s;ome of that popular Envy and Malice, of<MILESTONE N="40">
which He had no Contempt but much Apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>HE renewed his former Profe&s;&s;ions of his De&s;ire of Peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Wit <HI>pre|tends to de&s;ire a Peace.</HI></NOTE> and gave &s;o
good Rea&s;ons for it as might naturally gain Belief; among&s;t which one was
always a vehement Jealou&s;y of <HI>France,</HI> &startq;which,&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;though it had
at la&s;t declared War again&s;t <HI>England,</HI> which They ought to have done &s;o
long before, had done it only to draw <HI>England</HI> into &s;ome Conditions which
might facilitate their own Enterpri&s;e upon <HI>Flanders,</HI> which it concerned
them to prevent by all the Ways po&s;&s;ible; of which none would be &s;o
probable as a Peace between <HI>England</HI> and them, which would imme|diately
make each &s;olicitous for their own Intere&s;t. But how to &s;et any<MILESTONE N="50">
Thing on Foot that might contribute to this He knew not; and the doing
that which the other had propo&s;ed, by declaring him&s;elf, was the Way
<PB N="333" REF="337">
only to &s;lacken all the Provi&s;ions for War, the expediting of which would
mo&s;t advance a Peace.&endq;</P>
<P>BEWETT replied, &startq;that He knew He had many Friends in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>

Secrecy He would be accountable;&endq; and named the Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> who
had lately married a Lady of the <HI>Hague,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Mon&s;ieur Bever|waert,</HI>
a Per&s;on in his Quality and Fortune in the fir&s;t Rank. He offered
to him, &startq;that He would him&s;elf write &s;uch a Letter to the Lord <HI>Ar|lington</HI>
in his own Name, which He &s;hould fir&s;t &s;ee and approve, with|out
<MILESTONE N="10">which He would not &s;end it, as &s;hould only te&s;tify his own good
Wi&s;hes for a Peace between the two Nations, which were not unknown
to the King him&s;elf; and would make no other Mention of him, than
that He had Rea&s;on to believe, that <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Wit</HI> (in who&s;e good
Opinion He had the Honour to be known to have &s;ome Place) would not
be unwilling to promote any good Overture that &s;hould be made.&endq; Af|ter
&s;ome Debate He was content that He &s;hould write, provided that He
would promi&s;e to write Nothing but what He &s;hould fir&s;t &s;ee, and would
&s;till bring the An&s;wers to him which He &s;hould receive; to which the
other con&s;ented.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20">UPON this Encouragement He begun his Corre&s;pondence with the Lord

more to hope for Peace, and to look upon <HI>De Wit</HI> as not aver&s;e to it. But
what He writ was with &s;o much Warine&s;s, being dictated upon the Matter
by the Pen&s;ioner, that it could draw no other An&s;wers from the Secretary
but of the &s;ame Style, with Expre&s;&s;ions of his Maje&s;ty's De&s;ire of Peace and
E&s;teem of <HI>De Wit,</HI> and as if He expected &s;ome Overtures to ari&s;e from
thence. This Intelligence had not been long on Foot,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He &s;oon &s;u&s;|pects</HI> De Wit's <HI>Sincerity.</HI></NOTE> but He begun to
&s;u&s;pect the Sincerity of <HI>De Wit,</HI> and that indeed He was not &s;o well in|clined
to Peace as He had pretended to be: His Countenance was not &s;o
<MILESTONE N="30">open, nor He &s;o vacant when He came as He u&s;ed to be; He grew le&s;s
jealous of the <HI>French,</HI> and more compo&s;ed him&s;elf, and le&s;s apprehen&s;ive
of the People, as He found them more compo&s;ed, and a greater Concur|rence
in the making all Things ready for the Fleet. All which Ob&s;erva|tions
He likewi&s;e imparted to his Companions, who were glad to find him
begin to be undeceived; and from that Time He was apter to concur with
them in the fiercer Coun&s;els,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And re&s;olves to get a Peace in Oppo&s;ition to him.</NOTE> how to compa&s;s a Peace in Spite of him by

<P><MILESTONE N="40">HEREUPON He took a new Re&s;olution, but would not lo&s;e the Advan|tage
He had by the Knowledge <HI>De Wit</HI> had of his Corre&s;pondence, and
therefore &s;hewed him a Letter that He had received from the Lord <HI>Ar|lington,</HI>
in which He pre&s;&s;ed him &startq;to inform him, what Particulars would
di&s;po&s;e the <HI>States</HI> to Peace and to &s;eparate from the <HI>French,</HI>&endq; and had &s;ent
him a Cipher for the more free and &s;afe Communication; which Cipher
He depo&s;ited in the Hands of <HI>De Wit,</HI> having received his Directions and

which He grew weary, and le&s;s confident of the Per&s;on, becau&s;e He heard

Servant to the late Prince&s;s Royal, and a Native of <HI>Orange,</HI> with a full Ac|count

that He &s;hould be compelled at the next A&s;&s;embly of the <HI>States</HI> to &s;ubmit

Cipher was only to be made U&s;e of.&endq;</P>
<P>THOSE Informations by <HI>Silvius,</HI> who was a Man of Parts, and had De|pendance
upon the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> and meant not to return into <HI>Holland</HI>
except upon a pre&s;&s;ing Occa&s;ion, when He dur&s;t adventure to go, being
looked upon as an Inhabitant of the <HI>Hague,</HI> having been always bred there,
and his Relation to the Duke &s;carce yet taken Notice of; I &s;ay, tho&s;e In|formations
the King thought to be worthy to be well con&s;idered, and con|ferred
with the Chancellor upon the Whole, and appointed the Lord <HI>Ar|lington</HI>
to inform him of all that had pa&s;&s;ed from the Beginning; and that
<HI>Silvius,</HI> who was concealed, that They might have no Adverti&s;ement in<MILESTONE N="30">
<HI>Holland</HI> of his having been in <HI>England,</HI> &s;hould likewi&s;e attend him in &s;ome
Evening; which He &s;hortly after did, and made him an ample and clear
Relation of the State of the Coun&s;els at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and the &s;everal Factions
among&s;t them, and the Di&s;temper of the People. He had him&s;elf &s;poken
with many of the <HI>Burgoma&s;ters</HI> and others in Authority, who were privy to
his Coming, and communicated the Method They meant to proceed in to|wards
the depre&s;&s;ing <HI>De Wit,</HI> by mingling the Propo&s;ition for Peace with
the Intere&s;t of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> which the People thought to be in&s;e|parable.</P>
<P>IN Fine, He gave a perfect good Account of all to which He was in|&s;tructed,
with great Mode&s;ty: And when the Chancellor, to whom <HI>Bewett</HI><MILESTONE N="40">
and He were Both well known, would have induced him to deliver Somewhat
of his own Judgment, whether He thought that Combination to be &s;trong
enough to over-rule <HI>De Wit;</HI> He could draw no other An&s;wer from him
than the magnifying the Credit and Intere&s;t of <HI>Bewett,</HI> which He &s;eemed
principally to rely upon, and the Impo&s;&s;ibility that He &s;hould fail in Point
of Integrity or Courage.</P>
<P>SILVIUS had &s;ettled a &s;ure Way of Corre&s;pondence, and by every Po&s;t re|ceived
fre&s;h Intelligence of the Preparations and Progre&s;s <HI>Bewett</HI> and his
Friends made in their De&s;igns, of the Succe&s;s whereof They were every Day
more confident, and thought their Party &s;o much to increa&s;e, that as They<MILESTONE N="50">
did not apprehend any Di&s;covery like to be made by Treachery, &s;o They
did not &s;eem to fear it, if <HI>De Wit</HI> him&s;elf &s;hould know all that They in|tended:
<PB N="335" REF="339">
And They pre&s;&s;ed very earne&s;tly, &startq;that the King's Letter, in the
Manner They had propo&s;ed, might be at the <HI>Hague</HI> when the <HI>General
States</HI> were to meet,&endq; the Time whereof approached.</P>
<P>THE King called tho&s;e to him to whom the whole Negotiation had been
imparted, to advi&s;e what was to be done. On the King's Part Nothing was
con&s;iderable, but whether He &s;hould write to the <HI>States</HI> at all, and what
He &s;hould write: And again&s;t writing there &s;eemed to be no Objection,
and as little again&s;t writing what They advi&s;ed, which was no more than
He had formerly writ, and always &s;aid to their Amba&s;&s;adour. And that this
<MILESTONE N="10">might be a more favourable Conjuncture for the good Reception of it, and
hearkening to it, his Maje&s;ty was rea&s;onably to believe tho&s;e who meant to
&s;econd and promote it with their own Rea&s;ons: And therefore the Time and
the Manner of the Delivery of it was left to be re&s;olved among&s;t them&s;elves,
the King having no Mini&s;ter there to pre&s;ent it.</P>
<P>THE Way that They had thought of was, that <HI>Bewett</HI> &s;hould at the
proper Time deliver it to <HI>De Wit,</HI> who dur&s;t not conceal it, and if He
&s;hould, there would be Ways enough to publi&s;h it to his Reproach; nor
could He take any Advantage of <HI>Bewett</HI> for his Corre&s;pondence with their
Enemies, becau&s;e it had been entered into with his Approbation. But for
<MILESTONE N="20">the better Security in the &s;ending it, and the better Information of the Per|&s;ons
engaged of all the Reflections which had been made by the King, and
tho&s;e with whom He had conferred by his Maje&s;ty's Order, it was thought
be&s;t that <HI>Silvius</HI> &s;hould return; and if <HI>Bewett</HI> thought fit to decline the De|livery
of the King's Letter, and no better Way could be found for the De|livery
of it, He might pre&s;ent it in the Manner his Friends there &s;hould di|rect,
and avow his having been at <HI>London</HI> to &s;olicit his own Pretences &s;ince
the Death of the Prince&s;s Royal his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and that He had received the
Letter from the King's own Hand. This being the concurrent Opinion
of all, and the Gentleman him&s;elf willing to undertake it; <HI>Silvius</HI> was
<MILESTONE N="30">di&s;patched.</P>
<P>IN the Debate of the Matter, the King a&s;ked the Chancellor &startq;what He
thought of the De&s;ign, and whether He thought it would &s;ucceed;&endq; who
&s;aid, &startq;He doubted it much, and that it would conclude in the Lo&s;s of
poor <HI>Bewett's</HI> Head, who had not a Talent for the Managery of an Af|fair
of that Weight, which would require great Secrecy and great Sobriety,
and the Con&s;ideration of more Particulars at once than his Comprehen&s;ion
could contain together.&endq; Then He did not like the Method They propo&s;ed,
of joining the Demand of Peace with the Intere&s;t of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI>
which, though it might probably follow the Peace and be an Effect of it,
<MILESTONE N="40">would not be &s;ea&s;onable to be joined with it in Regard of his Infancy; and
that many did heartily de&s;ire the Peace, who had no Mind that the Prince
&s;hould be re&s;tored to the Offices of his Father and Family, or that there
&s;hould be any Debate of it, till the Prince came to the Age that was pro|vided
by the &s;olemn Act and Declaration of the <HI>States:</HI> Which had been
the Rea&s;on that his Maje&s;ty (who had all the Tenderne&s;s for his Nephew
that a Parent could have) would never be per&s;uaded to mention him (though
it had been propo&s;ed by many, and even by the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI>
and the Prince&s;s Dowager) in the Conditions of the Peace; the King fore|&s;eeing
that <HI>De Wit</HI> would have been glad to have that Advantage, as to
<MILESTONE N="50">ob&s;erve to the People, that the King would pre&s;cribe to them what Officers
They &s;hould choo&s;e and admit into their Government, and that They
mu&s;t have no Peace, except They would take a General and a Stadtholder
<PB N="336" REF="340">
and an Admiral of his Nomination, which was to make them &s;ubject to
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>AND this was the Rea&s;on, that in all Conferences with the <HI>French</HI> Am|ba&s;&s;adours,
who &s;ometimes would mention the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> with Com|pa&s;&s;ion
for the Ingratitude of the <HI>States</HI> towards him, and add, &startq;that They
doubted not their Ma&s;ter would be ready to join with his Maje&s;ty in doing
him all Offices;&endq; and &s;ometimes when the <HI>Dutch</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour (who was
of that Party that did really wi&s;h the Re&s;toration of the Prince) in Con|ference
would &s;eem to wi&s;h and to believe, that the re&s;toring the Prince
of <HI>Orange</HI> would be the Con&s;equence of the Peace: The King never gave<MILESTONE N="10">
other An&s;wer, than &startq;that He &s;hould be very glad that the <HI>States</HI> would
gratify his Nephew; but that it was a Matter He had Nothing to do
to interpo&s;e in, it depending wholly upon their own Good-Will and
Plea&s;ure.&endq;</P>
<P>THE re&s;t who were pre&s;ent had much more E&s;teem of <HI>Bewett</HI> than the
Chancellor had (who thought as well of his Courage and Integrity as They
did), and believed He would have Succe&s;s in what He de&s;igned, his In|tere&s;t
in the Right of his Wife being confe&s;&s;edly very great among&s;t the
<HI>States,</HI> and his jolly Cour&s;e of Living having rendered him very acceptable
and grateful to Men of the mo&s;t different Affections; and then of all the<MILESTONE N="20">
Officers of the Militia He was mo&s;t e&s;teemed, which was like to be of Mo|ment
if the Di&s;pute brought the Matter to a Struggle: But the Event &s;hewed
the Contrary.</P>
<P>AFTER <HI>Silvius's</HI> Departure, Letters pa&s;&s;ed between them, as they had
u&s;ed to do, for two or three Po&s;ts. And <HI>Bewett</HI> one Day meeting <HI>De Wit</HI>
when He came from his good Fellows, and They walking a Turn together
in common Di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>De Wit</HI> a&s;ked him, &startq;when He had any Letter
from <HI>England,</HI> and how Affairs went there:&endq; To which He &s;uddenly an|&s;wered,
&startq;that He came ju&s;t then from receiving one,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bewett's <HI>&s;e|cret Corre&s;|pondence acci|dentally di&s;co|vered by</HI> De Wit.</NOTE> which He had not
yet deciphered,&endq; and put his Hand into his Pocket, and took thence a<MILESTONE N="30">
Letter; and ca&s;ting his Eyes (which were never good, and now wor&s;e by
the Company He had left) upon the Super&s;cription, He gave it to him, and
&s;aid, &startq;He would go with him that They might decipher it together accord|ing
to Cu&s;tom.&endq;</P>
<P>DE WIT pre&s;ently found that it was not the accu&s;tomed Cipher (for He
had delivered the wrong Letter, that which He ought not to &s;ee), and de|&s;ired
him &startq;that He would walk before, and He would pre&s;ently overtake
him, after He had &s;poken a few Words at a Hou&s;e in his Way.&endq; And
&s;o leaving him, He took pre&s;ent Order for the apprehending him and &s;earch|ing
his Pockets; and at the &s;ame Time &s;ent to his Hou&s;e, and cau&s;ed his<MILESTONE N="40">
Cabinet, where all his Papers were, to be examined and &s;ealed up. And
&s;o poor <HI>Bewett,</HI> whil&s;t He &s;tayed at the other's Hou&s;e that They might
decipher the Letter, was apprehended, and all his Papers taken out of his
Pockets, and He &s;ent to Pri&s;on. The other Cipher was quickly found,
and many Letters and other Papers, which di&s;covered many Secrets. Where|upon
a Court of Ju&s;tice was &s;peedily erected: And within three Days, ac|cording
to the Expedition u&s;ed there in &s;uch Ca&s;es, a Scaffold was erected,
and the poor Gentleman brought thither in the Sight of all his Friends;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Upon which He is executed.</NOTE> and
there, with his known Courage, and in few Words declaring &startq;that He had
hone&s;t Purpo&s;es to the Country,&endq; lo&s;t his Head.<MILESTONE N="50"></P>
<P>SILVIUS quickly heard of his Impri&s;onment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Friends obliged to $word$.</NOTE> and as &s;oon thought it ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to make his own E&s;cape, and arrived in <HI>England</HI> before He heard
of his la&s;t Misfortune, which He did not &s;u&s;pect, nor knew how the Di&s;|covery
<PB N="337" REF="341">
had been made. The Knot, thus broken, di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves:
Mo&s;t of them got into <HI>Flanders;</HI> the <HI>Burgoma&s;ter</HI> of <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and two
or three others of Note, made all the Ha&s;te They could into <HI>England;</HI>
&s;ome thought them&s;elves &s;ecure in <HI>Antwerp</HI> and other Parts of <HI>Flanders;</HI>
and &s;ome were &s;eized upon in &s;everal Places of the <HI>States</HI> Dominions, and
impri&s;oned with all the Circum&s;tances of Severity, though upon the Want
of clear Proofs few of them were put to Death. The Troop of Guards was
reformed, or rather transformed, under new Officers, and a&s;&s;igned for a
con&s;tant Guard to the <HI>States,</HI> without the lea&s;t formal Relation to the
<MILESTONE N="10">Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> or u&s;ing his Name or Livery, or Permi&s;&s;ion to pay any
Reverence to him. And &s;o the Prince was much lower than before, and
all Hopes of reviving almo&s;t extingui&s;hed or expired; <HI>De Wit</HI> &s;tood firmer
upon his own Feet than ever, and directed all Preparations for the War
without Control; and all the pre&s;ent Expectation in <HI>England</HI> vani&s;hed:
Whil&s;t the Pen&s;ionary informed <HI>France</HI> of the Dangers He had e&s;caped for
them, and what great Matters had been offered to him if He would have
departed from their Intere&s;t; and made the Plot to contain all that He fan|cied
it might have done.</P>
<P>WHEN the Parliament at <HI>Oxford</HI> was prorogued, it was to a Day in
<MILESTONE N="20"><HI>April:</HI> But the King had Rea&s;on to believe that They would not &s;o &s;oon be
in good Humour enough to give more Money, which was the principal End
of calling them together. And the Dregs of the Plague &s;till remaining,
and venting its Malignity in many Burials every Week, his Maje&s;ty thought
fit to di&s;pen&s;e with their Attendance at that Time by a Proclamation: And
He cau&s;ed it at the Day to be prorogued to the twentieth of <HI>September</HI> fol|lowing.
In the mean Time the Court abounded in all its Exce&s;&s;es. There
had been &s;ome Hope during the Abode at <HI>Oxford,</HI> that the Queen had
been with Child; and whil&s;t that Hope la&s;ted, the King lived with more
Con&s;traint and Caution, and prepared to make him&s;elf worthy of that
<MILESTONE N="30">Ble&s;&s;ing: And there are many Rea&s;ons to believe, be&s;ides his own natural
good Inclinations, that if God had vouch&s;afed to have given him a Child,
and the Queen that Ble&s;&s;ing to have merited from him, He would have re|&s;trained
all tho&s;e inordinate Appetites and Delights; and that He would &s;e|riou&s;ly
have applied him&s;elf to his Government, and cut off all tho&s;e extra|vagant
Expen&s;es of Money and Time, which di&s;turbed and corrupted the
Evenne&s;s of his own Nature and the Sincerity of his Intentions, and expo&s;ed
him to the Temptations of tho&s;e who had all the Traps and Snares to catch
and detain him.</P>
<P>THE Imagination of the Queen's Breeding was one Cau&s;e of her Stay
<MILESTONE N="40">there;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen mi&s;carries.</NOTE> and her Stay there was the longer, becau&s;e She mi&s;carried when She
intended to begin her Journey. And though the Doctors declared that it
was a real Mi&s;carriage, ripe enough to make a Judgment of the Sex; yet
&s;ome of the Women who had more Credit with the King a&s;&s;ured him, &startq;that
it was only a fal&s;e Conception, and that She had not been at all with
Child:&endq; In&s;omuch that his Maje&s;ty, who had been &s;o confident upon
a former Occa&s;ion, as to declare to the Queen his Mother and to others,
&startq;that upon his own Knowledge her Maje&s;ty had mi&s;carried of a Son,&endq; &s;uf|fered
him&s;elf now to be &s;o totally convinced by tho&s;e Ladies and other Wo|men,
that He did as po&s;itively believe that She never had, never could be,
<MILESTONE N="50">with Child.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Licen&s;e in the Court.</NOTE> And from that Time He took little Plea&s;ure in her Conver&s;a|tion,
and more indulged to him&s;elf all Liberties in the Conver&s;ation of
tho&s;e, who u&s;ed all their Skill to &s;upply him with Diverti&s;ements, which
might drive all that was &s;erious out of his Thoughts, and make him un|dervalue
<PB N="338" REF="342">
tho&s;e whom He had u&s;ed, and &s;till did mo&s;t tru&s;t and employ, in
what He thought mo&s;t important; though He &s;ometimes thought many
Things not of Importance, which in the Con&s;equence were of the highe&s;t.</P>
<P>THE Lady, who had never declined in Favour, was now greater in
Power than ever: She was with Child again, and well enough contented
that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould entertain an Amour with another Lady, and made
a very &s;trict Friend&s;hip with her, it may be the more diligently out of Con|fidence
that He would never prevail with her, which many others believed
too. But without Doubt the King's Pa&s;&s;ion was &s;tronger towards that other
Lady, than ever it was to any other Woman: And She carried it with that<MILESTONE N="10">
Di&s;cretion and Mode&s;ty, that She made no other U&s;e of it than for the
Convenience of her own Fortune and Sub&s;i&s;tence, which was narrow enough;
never &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to interpo&s;e in the lea&s;t Degree in Bu&s;ine&s;s, nor to
&s;peak ill of any Body; which Kind of Nature and Temper the more in|flamed
the King's Affection, who did not in his Nature love a bu&s;y Wo|man,
and had an Aver&s;ion from &s;peaking with any Woman, or hearing
them &s;peak, of any Bu&s;ine&s;s but to that Purpo&s;e He thought them all made
for, however They broke in afterwards upon him to all other Purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>THE Lady her&s;elf, who every Day (as was &s;aid before) grew in Power
and Credit, did not yet pre&s;ume to interpo&s;e in any other Bu&s;ine&s;s, than<MILESTONE N="20">
in giving all the imaginable Countenance She could to tho&s;e who de&s;ired to
depend upon her, and, in their Right as well as her own, in depre&s;&s;ing the
Credit of tho&s;e who She knew wi&s;hed her's much le&s;s than it was; but in
this la&s;t Argument She was hitherto wary, and took only &s;uch Opportuni|ties
as were offered, without going out of her Way to find them. Her
principal Bu&s;ine&s;s was to get an E&s;tate for her&s;elf and her Children, which
She thought the King at lea&s;t as much concerned to provide as She to &s;oli|cit;
which however She would not be wanting in, and &s;o procured round
Sums of Money out of the Privy Pur&s;e (where She had placed Mr. <HI>May</HI>),
and other A&s;&s;ignations in other Names, and &s;o the le&s;s taken Notice of,<MILESTONE N="30">
though in great Proportions: All which yet amounted to little more than
to pay her Debts, which She had in few Years contracted to an unima|ginable
Greatne&s;s, and to defray her con&s;tant Expen&s;es, which were very
exce&s;&s;ive in Coaches and Hor&s;es, Cloaths and Jewels, without any Thing
of Genero&s;ity, or gratifying any of her Family, or &s;o much as paying any
of her Father's Debts, whereof &s;ome were very clamorous. Her Name
was not u&s;ed in any Suits for the Grant of Lands; for be&s;ides that there
was no avowing or publick Mention of natural Children, She did think
the Chancellor and Trea&s;urer willing to ob&s;truct &s;uch Grants, and de|&s;ired
not to have any Occa&s;ion to try the Kindne&s;s of either of them:<MILESTONE N="40">
And &s;o all the Suits She made of that Kind were with Reference to <HI>Ire|land,</HI>
where They had no Title to ob&s;truct, nor natural Opportunity to
know, what was granted; and in that Kingdom She procured the Grant of
&s;everal great Quantities of Land, like to prove of great Benefit and Value to
her or her Children.</P>
<P>THE chief De&s;ign They now begun to de&s;ign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Attempt to rai&s;e Jealou&s;ies in the King of his Brother.</NOTE> and the wor&s;t They could
ever de&s;ign, was to rai&s;e a Jealou&s;y in the King of his Brother, to which his
Maje&s;ty was not in any Degree inclined, and had in Truth a ju&s;t Affection
for him and Confidence in him, without thinking better of his natural
Parts than He thought there was Cau&s;e for; and yet, which made it the<MILESTONE N="50">
more wondered at, He did very often depart in Matters of the highe&s;t
Moment from his own Judgment to comply with his Brother, who was
in&s;tructed, by tho&s;e who too well knew the King's Nature, to adhere to
<PB N="339" REF="343">
any Thing He once advi&s;ed, and to be importunate in any Thing He pro|po&s;ed;
in which He prevailed the more ea&s;ily, becau&s;e He never u&s;ed it in
any Thing that concerned him&s;elf or his own Benefit.</P>
<P>THE Truth is:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Temper and Di&s;po&s;ition of the</HI> Stuart <HI>Family.</HI></NOTE> It was the unhappy Fate and Con&s;titution of that Fa|mily,
that They tru&s;ted naturally the Judgments of tho&s;e, who were as
much inferiour to them in Under&s;tanding as They were in Quality, before
their own which was very good; and &s;uffered even their Natures, which
di&s;po&s;ed them to Virtue and Ju&s;tice, to be prevailed upon and altered and
corrupted by tho&s;e, who knew how to make U&s;e of &s;ome one Infirmity that
<MILESTONE N="10">They di&s;covered in them; and by complying with that, and cheri&s;hing and
&s;erving it, They by Degrees wrought upon the Ma&s;s, and &s;acrificed all the
other good Inclinations to that &s;ingle Vice. They were too much inclined
to like Men at fir&s;t Sight, and did not love the Conver&s;ation of Men of
many more Years than them&s;elves, and thought Age not only trouble&s;ome
but impertinent. They did not love to deny, and le&s;s to Strangers than to
their Friends; not out of Bounty or Genero&s;ity, which was a Flower that
did never grow naturally in the Heart of either of the Families, that of
<HI>Stuart</HI> or the other of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> but out of an Un&s;kilfulne&s;s and Defect in
the Countenance: And when They prevailed with them&s;elves to make &s;ome
<MILESTONE N="20">Pau&s;e rather than to deny, Importunity removed all Re&s;olution, which
They knew neither how to &s;hut out nor to defend them&s;elves again&s;t, even
when it was evident enough that They had much rather not con&s;ent; which
often made that which would have looked like Bounty lo&s;e all its Grace
and Lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>IF the Duke &s;eemed to be more firm and fixed in his Re&s;olutions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Particularly of the King and Duke.</NOTE> it
was rather from an Ob&s;tinacy in his Will, which He defended by Aver|&s;ion
from the Debate, than from the Con&s;tancy of his Judgment, which
was more &s;ubject to Per&s;ons than to Arguments, and &s;o as changeable at
lea&s;t as the King's, which was in greate&s;t Danger by Surpri&s;e: And from
<MILESTONE N="30">this Want of Steadine&s;s, and Irre&s;olution (whence&s;oever the Infirmity pro|ceeded)
mo&s;t of the Misfortunes, which attended either of them or their
Servants who &s;erved them hone&s;tly, had their Ri&s;e and Growth; of which
there will be &s;hortly an Occa&s;ion, and too frequently, to &s;ay much more.
In the mean Time it cannot be denied, and was ob&s;erved and confe&s;&s;ed by
all, that never any Prince had a more humble and dutiful Conde&s;cen&s;ion and
Submi&s;&s;ion to an elder Brother, than the Duke had towards the King: His
whole Demeanour and Behaviour was &s;o full of Reverence, that it might
have given Example to be imitated by tho&s;e, who ought but did not ob&s;erve
a greater Di&s;tance. And the Con&s;cience and Re&s;entment He had within
<MILESTONE N="40">him&s;elf, for the Sally He had made in <HI>Flanders,</HI> made him after &s;o wary
in his Actions, and &s;o abhorring to hear any Thing that might le&s;&s;en his
Awe for the King, that no Man who had mo&s;t Credit with him dur&s;t ap|proach
towards any Thing of that Kind; &s;o that there was never le&s;s
Ground of Jealou&s;y than of him. And (as was &s;aid before) the King (who
was in his Nature &s;o far from any Kind of Jealou&s;y, that He was too
much inclined to make Interpretations of many Words and Actions, which
might rea&s;onably harbour other Apprehen&s;ions) was as incapable of any Infu|&s;ions
which might le&s;&s;en his Confidence in his Brother, as any noble and
virtuous Mind could be. And therefore tho&s;e ill Men, who began about
<MILESTONE N="50">this Time to &s;ow that cur&s;ed Seed that grew up to bear a large Crop of
the wor&s;t and ranke&s;t Jealou&s;y in the &s;ucceeding Time, did not pre&s;ume
to make any Reflection upon the Duke him&s;elf, but upon his Wife, &startq;upon
the State She a&s;&s;umed, and the Height of the whole Family, that lived
<PB N="340" REF="344">
in much more Plenty,&endq; They &s;aid, &startq;than the King's, and were more re|garded
abroad.&endq;</P>
<P>SUCH Kind of People are never without &s;ome particular Stories of the Per|&s;ons
whom They de&s;ire to deprave:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Endeavours u&s;ed to le&s;&s;en the King's E&s;|teem of the Dutche&s;s.</NOTE> And &s;o They had many In&s;tances, which
They u&s;ed upon all Occa&s;ions, of &s;ome Levity or Vanity, of &s;ome Words
affected by the Dutche&s;s, or &s;ome outward Carriage, true or fal&s;e, which
for the mo&s;t Part concluded in Mirth and Laughter, and &s;eemed ridiculous;
which was the Method They u&s;ed in all their Approaches of that Kind to|wards
the highe&s;t Acts of Malice, fir&s;t to make the Per&s;on, whom They
hoped to ruin in the End, le&s;s e&s;teemed, by the acting and Pre&s;entation of<MILESTONE N="10">
his Words and Ge&s;tures and Motions; which commonly is attended with
Laughter. And this is the fir&s;t Breach They make upon any Man's Repu|tation;
and the frequent Cu&s;tom of this Kind of Laughter and Mirth,
which is ea&s;ily produced without any Malice, doth in the End open a Space
large enough to let in Calumny and Scandal enough to weaken, if not to
de&s;troy, the be&s;t built Reputation.</P>
<P>THIS was the Cour&s;e They held with Reference to the Dutche&s;s, whom
the King had from the Beginning treated with great Grace and Favour,
and con&s;idered her as a Woman of more than an ordinary Wit and Un|der&s;tanding:
And the Queen Mother had from the Reconciliation u&s;ed<MILESTONE N="20">
her with that abundant Affection and Familiarity that was very wonderful;
and the Heights She a&s;&s;umed, and all that Greatne&s;s which many thought
too much, were not only inculcated, but enjoined by the Queen as a
Duty due to her Hu&s;band, of who&s;e high Degree She thought She could
not be too tender and careful. And She had the Happine&s;s &s;o well to be|have
her&s;elf towards the Duke, that He was exceedingly plea&s;ed with her,
and lived towards her with an Affection &s;o remarkable and notorious, that
it grew to be the publick Di&s;cour&s;e and Commendation; and which made
the Liberties that were taken el&s;ewhere the more &s;poken of and cen&s;ured.
It was very vi&s;ible that He liked her Company and Conver&s;ation very well,<MILESTONE N="30">
and was believed to communicate all his Coun&s;els, and all He knew or
thought, without Re&s;erve to her; which, being &s;o contrary to the profe&s;&s;ed
Doctrine of the Court, admini&s;tered Occa&s;ion to the Men of Mirth, in tho&s;e
Sea&s;ons which took up a good Part of every Night, to be very plea&s;ant
upon the Government of the Dutche&s;s, and the Submi&s;&s;ion of the Duke;
in which there were always &s;ome witty Reflections upon the Chancellor.
And this Kind of Liberty, being fir&s;t grateful to the King for the Wit that
accompanied it and the Mirth that it produced, grew by the Cu&s;tom of
it the more acceptable; and it may be the general and publick Ob&s;er|vation
of the Di&s;parity in the Lives of the two Brothers made it wi&s;hed,<MILESTONE N="40">
that there were no more of that Strictne&s;s in the one Place than in the
other, towards which there wanted not Application and Advice accordingly
as well as Example.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time the Chancellor had a hard Part to act, being neither
able to do the Good He con&s;tantly endeavoured on one Side, nor remove
the Ill He di&s;liked on the other Side; for He &s;aw well the Mi&s;chief that
would inevitably follow the great Expen&s;es of the Duke, which exceeded
all Limits and could never be provided for; and thought the Dutche&s;s to
be blamed for what She &s;pent upon her&s;elf, and u&s;ed all the Credit
He had with Both to begin in Time to reform what Nece&s;&s;ity would<MILESTONE N="50">
&s;hortly do with more Di&s;honour: But the Di&s;ea&s;e had grown from the
fir&s;t ill Dige&s;tion.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="345">
THE Lord <HI>Berkley</HI> had upon the King's fir&s;t Arrival formed a Family
without Rule or Precedent, and made the Servants in a much better Con|dition
than the Ma&s;ter, by a&s;&s;igning liberal Pen&s;ions and Allowances to
them, who had paid him dear for their Places, without con&s;idering from
what Fund they &s;hould ari&s;e: And now They all would have the Duke
believe, &startq;that He &s;pent not too much; but that He had too little Provi&s;ion
a&s;&s;igned to him for his Quality and Relation, and that this proceeded from
the Neglect in the Chancellor, who was able, if He endeavoured it, to
per&s;uade the King to enlarge it to a ju&s;t Proportion.&endq; And this was as
<MILESTONE N="10">much urged to the Dutche&s;s as to the Duke, and it made in her a greater
Impre&s;&s;ion; and though She had in all other Re&s;pects a very entire Affec|tion
and even a Duty and Re&s;ignation to her Father, yet in this He had no
Authority with her, nor did She think him a competent Judge what Ex|pen&s;es
Princes &s;hould make: And having &s;een the State and Lu&s;tre in which
the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> lived in <HI>France,</HI> and having received many Infu&s;ions
from the Queen, of the great Defect in the Cu&s;toms of <HI>England,</HI> in pro|viding
either for the Re&s;pect or for the Support of the younger Sons of the
Crown, She thought that the Chancellor &s;hould rather u&s;e his Credit for the
enlarging that Narrowne&s;s, which the King was enough di&s;po&s;ed to, than to
<MILESTONE N="20">reform their Expen&s;es. But of this enough.</P>
<P>THE Plague had really &s;wept away and de&s;troyed &s;o many Seamen (<HI>Step|ney</HI>
and the Places adjacent, which were their common Habitations, being
almo&s;t depopulated) that now, all other Ob&s;tructions being removed, there
&s;eemed even an Impo&s;&s;ibility to procure Sailors and Mariners enough to &s;et
out the Fleet; in&s;omuch as They found it nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;s many Wa|termen,
and to disfurni&s;h all Merchants Ships which were prepared to be &s;et
out to the Plantations or to other Places of Trade: All which turned not
&s;o much to Benefit one Way, as it did to Lo&s;s another Way. But the be&s;t
Way to expedite all Things was the two Admirals going to the Fleet them|&s;elves,
<MILESTONE N="30">that They who re&s;olved to go might ha&s;ten thither, and that They
who had no Mind to go might, out of Shame, likewi&s;e accompany them.</P>
<P>THERE appeared great Unanimity and Con&s;ent between them. Only
Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> had a great De&s;ire to go in a Ship apart, and that They
might not be Both in one Ship: But upon Debate it appeared to be un|practicable,
and that in a Time of Action the Orders could not be the
&s;ame, if They who gave them were not together and in the &s;ame Place;
and &s;o the Prince was per&s;uaded not to be po&s;itive in that Particular.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Fleet puts to Sea under Prince</HI> Rupert <HI>and the Gene|ral.</HI></NOTE>
And &s;o They Both went together, and took Leave of the King towards the
End of <HI>April,</HI> and laboured &s;o effectually (as They were Both Men of great
<MILESTONE N="40">Dexterity and indefatigable Indu&s;try in &s;uch Conjunctures), that They car|ried
the Fleet out to Sea, well fitted and provided, by the Middle of <HI>May;</HI>
with which They pre&s;ently vi&s;ited the Coa&s;t of <HI>Holland,</HI> and took many
Prizes; and by the Intelligence They met with concluded that the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Fleet would not be ready in a Month, of which They gave the King Ad|verti&s;ement,
and returned into the <HI>Downs.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Occa&s;ion of the Divi|&s;ion of the Fleet.</NOTE> And Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> at the &s;ame

and &startq;that They would not put to Sea till They fore&s;aw that They were
like to join about <HI>Calais.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50">AT or near the &s;ame Time the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> received Intelligence,
&startq;that the <HI>Dutch</HI> were not yet well manned; and that the Ships which

for him, it was concluded that He mu&s;t be well advanced in his Way,
and He had no Port to Friend till He came to the Coa&s;t of <HI>France</HI>
near <HI>Calais.</HI></P>
<P>UPON this there &s;eemed a great De&s;ire that Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> might take the<MILESTONE N="10">
Cour&s;e He had propo&s;ed; for the Convenience was agreed to be very great,
if the <HI>French</HI> could be met with before the Conjunction. However the
Council was &s;o wary that at that Time attended the King at <HI>Worce&s;ter-Hou&s;e,</HI>
the Chancellor being affected with the Gout, that They advi&s;ed the
King &startq;not to &s;end po&s;itive Orders for the dividing the Fleet, which by
many Accidents might produce Inconveniences; but rather to &s;end two
of the Council to the Fleet, with an Account of all the Intelligence,
and the Reflections which occurred to the King upon it.&endq; And here|upon
Sir <HI>George Carteret</HI> and Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> were pre&s;ently &s;ent, and
carried &s;uch Orders with them, as would be nece&s;&s;ary if the Generals had<MILESTONE N="20">
not other Intelligence, or did think that the Divi&s;ion was not liable to more
Objections than had been in View. And this Caution I &s;et down more
particularly, becau&s;e the Council underwent Reproaches which it did not
de&s;erve.</P>
<P>THE two Coun&s;ellors u&s;ed &s;uch Expedition, and found &s;o good Conve|niences
by Land and Water, that They returned to the King the next Day
with an Account, &startq;that the State of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet was confirmed to be
the &s;ame that his Maje&s;ty had heard, and that They believed the other
concerning the Duke of <HI>Beaufort</HI> to be very probable; whereupon They
had concluded with a mutual Con&s;ent and Approbation, <HI>that Prince</HI> Ru|pert<MILESTONE N="30">
<HI>&s;hould take twenty of the Ships, which He had already cho&s;en, to meet
the</HI> French, <HI>though They were &s;uperiour in Number, whil&s;t the General re|mained
in the</HI> Downs <HI>with the re&s;t:</HI> And in Order to this that the Prince
went aboard his Ship before They came away, and the rather, becau&s;e
the Wind was &s;o much again&s;t him, that his Maje&s;ty's Orders, if He
found Cau&s;e to &s;end any, would be &s;ure for &s;ome Days to find him upon
the We&s;tern Coa&s;t; and the Wind that was again&s;t him was &s;o favoura|ble
to the Duke of <HI>Beaufort,</HI> that it was probable They might &s;peedily
meet, and in a Place to be wi&s;hed.&endq; The King &s;aw no Cau&s;e yet to
&s;end Orders to the Contrary; and this was the Rea&s;on, and all the Circum|&s;tances,<MILESTONE N="40">
of the Separation of the Fleet that proved unfortunate.</P>
<P>IT appeared very &s;oon after, which Secretary had the better Intelligence:
For the very next Day after the Departure of the Prince, the General, who
remained in the <HI>Downs,</HI> had certain Intelligence that the <HI>Dutch</HI> were come
out of their Harbours, having it &s;eems received Intelligence likewi&s;e of the
<HI>French</HI> Fleet's being at Sea, and being obliged to meet them, and had been
long ready to do &s;o; which had deceived the Court, They believing that
They &s;tayed becau&s;e They were not ready to come out, whereas They were
ready and expected only the other Adverti&s;ement.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the General was informed, He &s;ent Notice pre&s;ently to the<MILESTONE N="50">
Duke late in the &s;ame Evening, who, informing the King of it, gave Or|ders

might have come to the Prince before the Morning.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Neglect in forwarding an Order to Prince</HI> Rupert <HI>to rejoin the Fleet.</HI></NOTE> But Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI>

whether They did not wake him, as He pretended, or being awake He de|ferred
it, it was not &s;ent away till the next Day, and never came to Prince

<MILESTONE N="10">and no He &s;ooner endeavoured to return, but the Wind chopped about
to retard him, that He could make little Way that Day or the Night
following. Who&s;e Fault it was that the&s;e important Orders were not &s;ent
with more Expedition, whether Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> ought not to have
taken Care for the conveying them, at lea&s;t to have given the Lord <HI>Arling|ton</HI>
Notice what the Contents of them were, of which He denied to have
any Notice, was di&s;puted with &s;ome Warmth between them&s;elves, and &s;o
came to be publi&s;hed: But it was never examined any where el&s;e, though
the Negligence was very mi&s;chievous in its Effect; but They were Both too
great Men to be que&s;tioned in any Judicatory.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20">THE General, after the Notice He had received of the Motion of the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> ordered the Fleet to weigh Anchor about three of the Clock in the
Morning upon the fir&s;t of <HI>June</HI> 1666,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet comes out.</NOTE> to &s;ail to the <HI>Buoy of the Gun|fleet</HI>
to join with &s;ome other Ships which lay there, to get more Men, being
then but ill manned: And about &s;even of the Clock in the Morning the
Scouts came in, and brought the General Notice, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet was
to the Leeward, and probably intended to decline fighting till They might
join with the <HI>French.</HI> And it had been to be wi&s;hed that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had
&s;tood off too, upon Confidence that Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> whom the Wind had
kept from being far off, as They could not but know, would receive Di|rection
<MILESTONE N="30">from Court to return. But the General (who was as impatient upon
the Sight of an Enemy to engage with him as Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> him&s;elf, and
had a natural Contempt of the <HI>Dutch)</HI> called his Flag-Officers to Council,
and quickly re&s;olved, &startq;that it was not convenient nor &s;afe nor honourable
to decline the Battle, le&s;t it might take off the pre&s;ent Courage of the
Seamen.&endq; And truly in all tho&s;e Con&s;ultations, upon the like Occa&s;ions,
whoever propo&s;ed any wary Advice ran great Hazard of being reputed a
Coward. And &s;o They bore up with a full Wind upon the Enemy, not|with&s;tanding
the vi&s;ible Di&s;advantage They were in, in Re&s;pect of the Strength
of the Enemy, for in the Ab&s;ence of Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> there remained little
<MILESTONE N="40">above fifty Sail with the General; whereas <HI>De Ruyter's</HI> Fleet con&s;i&s;ted of
above four&s;core Sail, who ea&s;ily perceived his Advantage, and that a great
Part of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet was ab&s;ent, and &s;o willingly embraced the Occa|&s;ion,
and made what Sail He could to meet with them.</P>
<P>IT was about two of the Clock in the Afternoon when the Engagement
began;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;econd ge|neral Engage|ment.</NOTE> and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had got the Wind, which was &s;o high that They

&s;hot off, and received &s;uch Damage in their Tackling, which was
<MILESTONE N="50">the chief Aim of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> that They could hardly govern their Ships.
And by this Means the Enemy got the Wind; and the Battle continued
with great Fiercene&s;s, and Lo&s;s of many Men on Both Sides, till nine or

new great Ships came to their Aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Dutch <HI>re|inforced.</HI></NOTE> which gave them new Courage; &s;o that
that They renewed and maintained the Fight with great Re&s;olution, and
killed many Men of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and di&s;abled many of the Ships, till the
Night again parted them.</P>
<P>UPON the Account the General received that Night,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>retire.</HI></NOTE> and the new Ac|ce&s;s<MILESTONE N="10">
of Force to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> He thought it nece&s;&s;ary to retire; for though
He had lo&s;t no Ship, very many were &s;o di&s;abled, that there was Rea&s;on to
fear they would hardly hold out to recover the Shore. And thereupon
He cau&s;ed all tho&s;e Ships to be put before and make all the Sail they could,
and him&s;elf with &s;ixteen Ships in a Breadth went in the Rear: Which as
&s;oon as the Enemy perceived,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third Day's Action.</NOTE> They pur&s;ued, but came not within Reach
of their Guns till four of the Clock in the Afternoon; and then though
They &s;hot hard They did very little Harm, the Sternpieces of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
over-reaching their Broad&s;ides, which made many of them get off as quickly
as They could. But by this Time the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> de&s;cried about twenty Sail<MILESTONE N="20">
of Ships &s;tanding towards them, which They concluded to be Prince <HI>Ru|pert</HI>
(as it proved): And &s;o being earne&s;t to join, They edged up towards
them, but &s;o unfortunately, that many of the Flag-Ships were on Ground
off the <HI>Galloper-Sand.</HI> But with much ado they all got off &s;afe, the
<HI>Royal Prince</HI> only excepted, which for this la&s;t Age, and till the late War,
was held the be&s;t Ship in the World. This brave Ship &s;tuck &s;o fa&s;t that no
Art or Indu&s;try could move her; &s;o that the Enemy, when They found
They could not carry her off, &s;et her on Fire, and took the Captain Sir
<HI>George Ay&s;cue</HI> and all the Company Pri&s;oners, and without Di&s;tinction u&s;ed
all with great Barbarity, in which They pretended only to u&s;e Retaliation.<MILESTONE N="30">
That Night Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> joined:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prince</HI> Rupert <HI>comes up with his Squadron.</HI></NOTE> And then They bore to the Northward,
that They might get clear of the Sands; and thereby the Enemy got the
Wind again.</P>
<P>THE fourth Day of the Battle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fourth Day's Action.</NOTE> which was the fourth of <HI>June,</HI> the Enemy
being to Windward about three Leagues, the Generals in the Morning made
all Sail towards them: And They lay with their Sails to the Ma&s;ts to &s;tay
for them, which They would not have had the Courage to have done, if
They had not had Intelligence from the Pri&s;oners of the <HI>Prince,</HI> in how tat|tered
a Condition the Fleet was. The Battle began about eight of the
Clock in the Morning with extraordinary Confidence on Both Sides, the<MILESTONE N="40">
<HI>Dutch</HI> continuing their old Guard to &s;pend all their Shot upon the Rigging
and Ma&s;ts, and to defend them&s;elves from being boarded, which the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
mo&s;t intended and laboured to do. But the De&s;ign of the others &s;uc|ceeeded
better: In&s;omuch that one of the Vice-Admirals of a Squadron, and
other of the be&s;t Ships, were &s;o di&s;abled that They bore off from the Battle,
that They might mend and repair; which gave no &s;mall Encouragement to
the Enemy. But the two Generals were invincible, and continued the Battle
all the Day in &s;everal Forms, and by the Advantage of the Wind fired
&s;ix or &s;even of their Ships, and &s;unk others, and had two or three of their
own likewi&s;e &s;unk. And between &s;ix and &s;even at Night, as if by Con&s;ent<MILESTONE N="50">
(and no Doubt Both Sides were very weary of the Encounter), They &s;e|parated
without looking after each other, and ha&s;tened to their &s;everal
Coa&s;ts; many of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> being &s;o hurt in Yards, Ma&s;ts, Rigging
<PB N="345" REF="349">
and Hulls, many of them wanting Men to ply their Guns, and their Pow|der
and Shot near &s;pent, that with very much Difficulty they got into Har|bour:
And &s;o concluded that great Action,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Both Sides claim the Vit|tery.</NOTE> wherein either Side pretended
to have Advantage, and Both lo&s;t very much.</P>
<P>THE next Day after the Battle was &s;pent in fitting their Ma&s;ts and re|pairing
their Rigging, that They might be able to reach the Coa&s;t: And
when They came near it, the Generals called a Council about di&s;po&s;ing
tho&s;e Ships which could not remain at Sea, and &s;ent them to &s;uch &s;everal
Places as they might be &s;oone&s;t repaired in; and gave every Captain very
<MILESTONE N="10">&s;trict Order, &startq;that all po&s;&s;ible Diligence and Expedition &s;hould be u&s;ed to
get their Ships ready, and furni&s;hed with what&s;oever was wanting;&endq; and
the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Navy were required to be a&s;&s;i&s;tant in all Places.
And &s;o wonderful Diligence was u&s;ed (which appears almo&s;t incredible) that
the whole Fleet was &s;o well fitted, that by the &s;eventeenth Day of the
&s;ame Month, within a Fortnight after &s;o terrible a Battle, it was gathered
together to a Rendezvous to the <HI>Buoy of the Nore.</HI> The Enemy made as
much Ha&s;te, rather to meet with the <HI>French,</HI> who were every Day &s;till ex|pected,
than to fight with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and kept as near to their own Coa&s;t
as conveniently They could: So that how ready &s;oever the Generals were
<MILESTONE N="20">(who had never left their Ships) with the Fleet by the &s;eventeenth of the
Month, the Winds were &s;o aver&s;e or &s;o calm, that it was the four and twen|tieth
Day of that Month before They could reach the Sight of the Enemy.</P>
<P>AND the next Day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third ge|neral Engage|ment.</NOTE> which was the twenty fifth, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> made
all the Sail They could, and by ten in the Morning engaged in as hot
an Encounter as had hitherto been in any Engagement: And though
the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;eemed not to fight with the &s;ame Spirit and Mettle, yet the
Battle held till two in the Afternoon, when by the Advantage of the
Wind They bore away fa&s;ter than the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> could follow.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>victorious.</HI></NOTE> However
here They took Vice-Admiral <HI>Banchart,</HI> and his Ship of three&s;core Guns
<MILESTONE N="30">and three hundred Men was burned; and another Ship of &s;eventy Guns
and three hundred Men was likewi&s;e taken and burned; which the Ge|nerals
thought better, than to undergo the po&s;&s;ible Inconvenience of keep|ing
them: And &s;o They kept up as clo&s;e to the Enemy in the Night as
They could do. The next Morning They u&s;ed all their Sails, and de&s;igned
to board <HI>De Ruyter;</HI> which, the Wind le&s;&s;ening, They could not effect, He
fighting very well but running fa&s;ter: And &s;o, though very well pur&s;ued,
He got into his Fa&s;tne&s;s at the <HI>Wierings,</HI> with tho&s;e who were neare&s;t to
him. But the re&s;t who were farther off, and were like to have the Benefit of
the Night, tacked about: Which They who attacked <HI>De Ruyter</HI> perceiving,
<MILESTONE N="40">and that They could follow him no farther, and that the re&s;t were five and
forty Sail, They followed them, the Generals doing all They could with
their Squadron to put them&s;elves between them and the Coa&s;t; but the
Wind growing on a &s;udden calm, about Midnight They dropped their An|chors,
that They might not be driven farther than They had a Mind to be.
But in the Morning, when They weighed Anchor to pur&s;ue them, and made
all the Way They could with a little Wind, the Enemy got &s;o clo&s;e to their
own Shore, their Ships drawing le&s;s Water than the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that there could
be no farther Pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Part of the Fleet, which was &s;eparated when <HI>De Ruyter</HI> got
<MILESTONE N="50">into the <HI>Wierings,</HI> and which the Generals looked upon as their own, was
&s;o unhappily pur&s;ued, though by Men of very good Name, that they e&s;|caped;
which rai&s;ed a great Di&s;temper in the Fleet, whil&s;t &s;ome Officers of
the prime and mo&s;t unque&s;tionable Courage charged and accu&s;ed others,
<PB N="346" REF="350">
who had always given great Te&s;timony that They dur&s;t do any Thing, &startq;of
ba&s;e declining to fight when the Enemy was in their Power, and that
They cho&s;e rather to &s;uffer them to e&s;cape than to encounter them.&endq;
And this Di&s;pute and Expo&s;tulation, between Men who had many Seconds,
divided the Generals, one declaring him&s;elf on the one Side as the other did
on the other; but They wi&s;ely laid a&s;ide the Debate, till They &s;hould be at
more Lei&s;ure with le&s;s Inconvenience to determine it.</P>
<P>THE Generals thereupon, having thus &s;cattered the Enemy, re&s;olved to
ply upon the <HI>Dutch</HI> Coa&s;t to take all Ships of Trade, which They did;
and off the <HI>Texel</HI> and the <HI>Flie</HI> took many Prizes, both homeward and out|ward<MILESTONE N="10">
bound,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Attempt upon the I&s;land of</HI> Schelling.</NOTE> of great Value. And They having now Nothing to do but to
lie &s;till, there was a <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain, one <HI>Laurence Van Humskerke,</HI> who after
the fir&s;t Battle, in the Faction between <HI>Evert&s;on</HI> and <HI>Van Trump,</HI> had
given <HI>De Wit</HI> &s;o great an Advantage, that if He had not made his E&s;cape
He had been hanged, who from that Time had always been on Board
with Prince <HI>Rupert:</HI> This Man, whil&s;t the Fleet lay in this Po&s;ture, ad|vi&s;ed
Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> to attempt a Place near the <HI>Flie,</HI> which was &s;o locked
in the Land that it was always looked upon as very &s;ecure (and where
all Ships laden at <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> for the <HI>Straits</HI> and tho&s;e Parts, when they
were outward bound, u&s;ed to lie two or three Days, as in a &s;afe Port, un|til<MILESTONE N="20">
all Things which might be forgotten were prepared, and all the Company
came together), and had never been invaded in any War; and by it was a
pretty large Village, called <HI>Schelling,</HI> which had many good Hou&s;es in it, be|&s;ides
others inhabited by, and for the Entertainment of, Seamen.</P>
<P>THIS Enterpri&s;e was committed to Sir <HI>Robert Holmes,</HI> a very bold and ex|pert
Man; who with a Number of &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els very well manned, be&s;ides
a Body of &s;tout Foot to land upon Occa&s;ions, being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the <HI>Dutchman,</HI>
&s;o vigorou&s;ly a&s;&s;aulted it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chief Town and a large Fleet of Mer|chant Ships burnt.</NOTE> that He burned all the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships lying there,
being of ine&s;timable Value, all outward bound, and &s;ome of them worth
above one hundred thou&s;and Pounds each Ship. They burned likewi&s;e<MILESTONE N="30">
the whole Town of <HI>Schelling;</HI> which Conflagration, with that of the Ships,
appearing at the Break of Day &s;o near <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> put that Place into that
Con&s;ternation that They thought the Day of Judgment was come, not
thinking of their Ships there, as being out of the Power or Reach of any
Enemy: And no Doubt it was the greate&s;t Lo&s;s that State &s;u&s;tained in the
whole War, that is, greater than all the re&s;t. And as this Victory, if it can
be called a Victory when there is no Re&s;i&s;tance, occa&s;ioned great Triumph
in <HI>England,</HI> &s;o it rai&s;ed <HI>great Thoughts of Heart</HI> in <HI>De Wit,</HI> and a Re&s;o|lution
of Revenge before any Peace &s;hould be con&s;ented to; which They
effected to a good Degree the next Year.<MILESTONE N="40"></P>
<P>THERE appeared no more Likelihood of the <HI>Dutch</HI> coming out again:
So about the fifteenth of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the Generals returned to <HI>Southwould Bay</HI> to
receive a Recruit of Men, Provi&s;ions and Ammunition, having left Ships
enough upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Holland</HI> to take Prizes, and Scouts upon the
Coa&s;t to get Intelligence in what Readine&s;s the Enemy's Fleet was, and
what was done within the Land. And about the twenty &s;eventh a little
Pink, that waited upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Zealand,</HI> brought Notice that the
Enemy,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Datch <HI>Fleet puts to Sea again.</HI></NOTE> con&s;i&s;ting of about four&s;core Sail of Ships, were ready to come out
from the <HI>Wierings;</HI> and the next Day They were a&s;&s;ured that They were
come out and bound We&s;tward, by which They concluded that They had<MILESTONE N="50">
Hope to join the <HI>French</HI> Fleet. Whereupon the Generals gave pre&s;ent Orders
to unmoor the Fleet; and weighing Anchor about &s;even of the Clock in the
Morning &s;tood to Sea, and about Noon di&s;covered the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet about
<PB N="347" REF="351">
four Leagues to the Leeward. The Generals made all Sail towards them:
But the Enemy &s;tood away for the Coa&s;t of <HI>Flanders,</HI> whil&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
were &s;o entangled upon the <HI>Galloper-Sands,</HI> that They could not &s;tand af|ter
the Enemy till late in the Afternoon; &s;o that it was Night before They
came near each other, and then &s;everal Guns were fired to little Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THE next Morning, being the fir&s;t of <HI>September,</HI> the Sea&s;on when the
Winds begin to grow boi&s;terous, They had upon the breaking of the Day lo&s;t
the Sight of the Enemy, though They believed that They had bore up in the
Night for them: But when it was Light, They found that They were to the
<MILESTONE N="10">Leeward as far as They could di&s;cover, near <HI>St. John's Bay</HI> beyond <HI>Calais.</HI>
The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> pur&s;ued them, and making &s;ome Stay for the Fire&s;hips, which
could not make Ha&s;te by Rea&s;on of the blu&s;tering Weather, it was four in
the Afternoon before the Fleet came up together to them; when <HI>De Ruy|ter</HI>
made a Shew as if He would draw off from the Shore towards them.
But when He &s;aw the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;tand with him and advance with their u&s;ual
Re&s;olution, He tacked back again, and &s;tood clo&s;e in to the Shore, where
the re&s;t of the Fleet was,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Fleet di&s;per&s;ed by a Storm.</HI></NOTE> in the Bay of <HI>Staples.</HI> And then the Night
came; and the Wind blew &s;o violently, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were forced to
tack, and many of the Ships were forced to the Leeward, the Night being
<MILESTONE N="20">&s;o foul, that neither the Generals nor the chief Flags could be di&s;cerned.
And though the Storm continued very violent the next Day, a good Part of
the Fleet got again together, and &s;tood to the Bay of <HI>Staples,</HI> where the
<HI>Dutch</HI> &s;till remained clo&s;e under the Shore at Anchor, but could not be in|vited
to come out. So the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tand farther out
to the Sea; and then They di&s;covered the re&s;t of the Fleet at a great Di|&s;tance
to the Leeward, and &s;o bore after them, and at Night They all ar|rived
at <HI>St. Helen's Point.</HI> And though the Tempe&s;t &s;till increa&s;ed, a Squa|dron
went every Day out to the Coa&s;t of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>IN this Tempe&s;t the <HI>French</HI> Fleet had a very narrow E&s;cape,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> French <HI>Fleet has a narrow E&s;cape.</HI></NOTE> by a Pro|vidence
<MILESTONE N="30">They are &s;eldom without. A Gentleman of good Quality of that
Nation returned at this Time out of <HI>England</HI> (whither They repaired with
as much Liberty and were as kindly treated as if there were no War, whil&s;t
no <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> could be &s;afe there); and landing at <HI>Calais,</HI> and finding that
the Duke of <HI>Beaufort</HI> was every Day expected, He di&s;patched two or three
Barks to find him, with Information how and where the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> lay; one
of which came &s;o luckily to him towards the Evening, that He changed
his Cour&s;e, and by the Darkne&s;s of the Night got into the Road of <HI>Diepe,</HI>
where He dropped his Anchors. But his Vice-Admiral, being the bigge&s;t and
the be&s;t Ship but one in the Fleet, and carrying &s;eventy Pieces of Cannon,
<MILESTONE N="40">pur&s;uing the Cour&s;e He was directed, in the Dark of the Night fell among&s;t
the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as the re&s;t had done if it had not been for that Adverti&s;ement;
and after a little defending him&s;elf, which He &s;aw was to no Purpo&s;e, was
taken Pri&s;oner, and de&s;ired to be brought to Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> who knew him
well, and treated him as a gallant Per&s;on ought to be, and cau&s;ed many
Things which belonged to his own Per&s;on to be re&s;tored to him; and when
He was brought into <HI>England,</HI> He found another Kind of Reception
(though He was Pri&s;oner in the <HI>Tower</HI>) than any of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> though of
the &s;ame Quality, met with abroad. By this Accident the <HI>French</HI> Fleet made
a happy E&s;cape: And the Continuance of the Storm for many Days kept the
<MILESTONE N="50"><HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> from any farther Engagement. But the &s;ame Winds,
and at the &s;ame Time, did much more Mi&s;chief at Land than at Sea.</P>
<P>IT was upon the fir&s;t Day of that <HI>September,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Fir$ of</HI> London.</NOTE> in the di&s;mal Year of 1666
(in which many Prodigies were expected and &s;o many really fell out), that
<PB N="348" REF="352">
that memorable and terrible Fire brake out in <HI>London,</HI> which begun about
Midnight, or nearer the Morning of <HI>Sunday,</HI> in a Baker's Hou&s;e at the End
of <HI>Thames Street</HI> next the <HI>Tower,</HI> there being many little narrow Alleys
and very poor Hou&s;es about the Place where it fir&s;t appeared; and then
finding &s;uch Store of combu&s;tible Materials, as that Street is always fur|ni&s;hed
with in Timber-Hou&s;es, the Fire prevailed &s;o powerfully, that that
whole Street and the Neighbourhood was in &s;o &s;hort a Time turned to
A&s;hes, that few Per&s;ons had Time to &s;ave and pre&s;erve any of their Goods;
but were a Heap of People almo&s;t as dead with the &s;udden Di&s;traction, as
the Ruins were which They &s;u&s;tained. The Magi&s;trates of the City a&s;&s;em|bled<MILESTONE N="10">
quickly together, and with the u&s;ual Remedies of Buckets, which They
were provided with: But the Fire was too ravenous to be extingui&s;hed with
&s;uch Quantities of Water as tho&s;e In&s;truments could apply to it, and fa&s;|tened
&s;till upon new Materials before it had de&s;troyed the old. And though
it raged furiou&s;ly all that Day, to that Degree that all Men &s;tood amazed, as
Spectators only, no Man knowing what Remedy to apply, nor the Magi&s;|trates
what Orders to give: Yet it kept within &s;ome Compa&s;s, burned what was
next, and laid Hold only on Both Sides; and the greate&s;t Apprehen&s;ion was
of the <HI>Tower,</HI> and all Con&s;iderations entered upon how to &s;ecure that Place.</P>
<P>BUT in the Night the Wind changed, and carried the Danger from<MILESTONE N="20">
thence, but with &s;o great and irre&s;i&s;tible Violence, that as it kept the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
and <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleets from grappling when they were &s;o near each other, &s;o
it &s;cattered the Fire from pur&s;uing the Line it was in with all its Force, and
&s;pread it over the City: So that They, who went late to Bed at a great Di&s;|&s;tance
from any Place where the Fire prevailed, were awakened before Morn|ing
with their own Hou&s;e's being in a Flame; and whil&s;t Endeavour was u&s;ed
to quench that, other Hou&s;es were di&s;covered to be burning, which were
near no Place from whence They could imagine the Fire could come; all
which kindled another Fire in the Brea&s;ts of Men, almo&s;t as dangerous as
that within their Hou&s;es.<MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>MONDAY Morning produced fir&s;t a Jealou&s;y, and then an univer&s;al Con|clu&s;ion,
that this Fire came not by Chance, nor did They care where it
began; but the breaking out in &s;everal Places at &s;o great Di&s;tance from
each other made it evident, that it was by Con&s;piracy and Combination.
And this Determination could not hold long without Di&s;covery of the
wicked Authors, who were concluded to be all the <HI>Dutch</HI> and all the
<HI>French</HI> in the Town, though They had inhabited the &s;ame Places above
twenty Years. All of that Kind, or, if They were Strangers, of what Na|tion
&s;oever, were laid Hold of; and after all the ill U&s;age that can con&s;i&s;t in
Words, and &s;ome Blows and Kicks, They were thrown into Pri&s;on. And<MILESTONE N="40">
&s;hortly after, the &s;ame Conclu&s;ion comprehended all the <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI>
who were in the &s;ame Predicament of Guilt and Danger, and quickly
found that their only Safety con&s;i&s;ted in keeping within Doors; and yet
&s;ome of them, and of Quality, were taken by Force out of their Hou&s;es
and carried to Pri&s;on.</P>
<P>WHEN this Rage &s;pread as far as the Fire, and every Hour brought Reports
of &s;ome bloody Effects of it, wor&s;e than in Truth there were, the King di&s;|tributed
many of the Privy Council into &s;everal Quarters of the City, to
prevent, by their Authorities, tho&s;e Inhumanities which He heard were com|mitted.
In the mean Time, even They or any other Per&s;on thought it<MILESTONE N="50">
not &s;afe to declare, &startq;that They believed that the Fire came by Accident, or
that it was not a Plot of the <HI>Dutch</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> to burn the
City;&endq; which was &s;o generally believed, and in the be&s;t Company, that
<PB N="349" REF="353">
He who &s;aid the Contrary was &s;u&s;pected for a Con&s;pirator, or at be&s;t a Fa|vourer
of them. It could not be conceived, how a Hou&s;e that was di&s;tant
a Mile from any Part of the Fire could &s;uddenly be in a Flame, without
&s;ome particular Malice; and this Ca&s;e fell out every Hour. When a Man
at the farthe&s;t End of <HI>Bread-Street</HI> had made a Shift to get out of his Hou&s;e
his be&s;t and mo&s;t portable Goods, becau&s;e the Fire had approached near
them; He no &s;ooner had &s;ecured them, as He thought, in &s;ome Friend's
Hou&s;e in <HI>Holborn,</HI> which was believed a &s;afe Di&s;tance, but He &s;aw that
very Hou&s;e, and none el&s;e near it, in a &s;udden Flame. Nor did there
<MILESTONE N="10">want, in this woful Di&s;temper, the Te&s;timony of Witne&s;&s;es who &s;aw this
Villany committed, and apprehended Men who They were ready to &s;wear
threw Fireballs into Hou&s;es, which were pre&s;ently burning.</P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Hollis</HI> and Lord <HI>A&s;hley,</HI> who had their Quarters a&s;&s;igned about
<HI>Newgate-Market</HI> and the Streets adjacent, had many brought to them in
Cu&s;tody for Crimes of this Nature; and &s;aw, within a very little Di&s;tance from
the Place where They were, the People gathered together in great Di&s;order;
and as They came nearer &s;aw a Man in the Middle of them without a
Hat or Cloak, pulled and hauled and very ill u&s;ed, whom They knew to
be a Servant to the <HI>Portugal</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour, who was pre&s;ently brought to
<MILESTONE N="20">them. And a &s;ub&s;tantial Citizen was ready to take his Oath, &startq;that He
&s;aw that Man put his Hand in his Pocket, and throw into a Shop a Fire|ball;
upon which He &s;aw the Hou&s;e immediately on Fire: Whereupon,
being on the other Side of the Way, and &s;eeing this, He cried out to the
People to &s;top that Gentleman, and made all the Ha&s;te He could him|&s;elf;&endq;
but the People had fir&s;t &s;eized upon him, and taken away his
Sword, which He was ready to draw; and He not &s;peaking nor under|&s;tanding
<HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> They had u&s;ed him in the Manner &s;et down before. The
Lord <HI>Hollis</HI> told him what He was accu&s;ed of, and &startq;that He was &s;een to
have thrown Somewhat out of his Pocket, which They thought to be a
<MILESTONE N="30">Fireball, into a Hou&s;e which was now on Fire;&endq; and the People had di|ligently
&s;earched his Pockets to find more of the &s;ame Commodities, but
found Nothing that They meant to accu&s;e him of. The Man &s;tanding in
great Amazement to hear He was &s;o charged, the Lord <HI>Hollis</HI> a&s;ked him,
&startq;what it was that He pulled out of his Pocket, and what it was He
threw into the Hou&s;e:&endq; To which He an&s;wered, &startq;that He did not think
that He had put his Hand into his Pocket; but He remembered very well,
that as He walked in the Street He &s;aw a Piece of Bread upon the Ground,
which He took up and laid upon a Shelf in the next Hou&s;e;&endq; which is a
Cu&s;tom or Super&s;tition &s;o natural to the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> that if the King of
<MILESTONE N="40"><HI>Portugal</HI> were walking, and &s;aw a Piece of Bread upon the Ground, He
would take it up with his own Hand, and keep it till He &s;aw a fit Place to
lay it down.</P>
<P>THE Hou&s;e being in View, the Lords with many of the People walked
to it, and found the Piece of Bread ju&s;t within the Door upon a Board,
where He &s;aid He laid it; and the Hou&s;e on Fire was two Doors beyond
it, which the Man who was on the other Side of the Way, and &s;aw this
Man put his Hand into the Hou&s;e without &s;taying, and pre&s;ently after the
Fire break out, concluded to be the &s;ame Hou&s;e; which was very natural
in the Fright that all Men were in: Nor did the Lords, though They were
<MILESTONE N="50">&s;atisfied, &s;et the poor Man at Liberty; but, as if there remained Ground
enough of Su&s;picion, committed him to the Con&s;table, to be kept by him
in his own Hou&s;e for &s;ome Hours, when They pretended They would exa|mine
him again. Nor were any Per&s;ons who were &s;eized upon in the &s;ame
<PB N="350" REF="354">
Manner, as Multitudes were in all the Parts of the Town, e&s;pecially if They
were Strangers or <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> pre&s;ently di&s;charged, when there was no rea&s;on|able
Ground to &s;u&s;pect; but all &s;ent to Pri&s;on, where They were in much more
Security than They could have been in full Liberty, after They were once
known to have been &s;u&s;pected; and mo&s;t of them under&s;tood their Com|mitment
to be upon that Ground, and were glad of it.</P>
<P>THE Fire and the Wind continued in the &s;ame Exce&s;s all <HI>Monday, Tue&s;|day,</HI>
and <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> till Afternoon, and flung and &s;cattered Brands burn|ing
into all Quarters; the Nights more terrible than the Days, and the
Light the &s;ame, the Light of the Fire &s;upplying that of the Sun. And in|deed<MILESTONE N="10">
whoever was an Eyewitne&s;s of that terrible Pro&s;pect, can never have
&s;o lively an Image of the la&s;t Conflagration till He beholds it; the Faces of
all People in a wonderful Dejection and Di&s;compo&s;ure, not knowing where
They could repo&s;e them&s;elves for one Hour's Sleep, and no Di&s;tance thought
&s;ecure from the Fire, which &s;uddenly &s;tarted up before it was &s;u&s;pected; &s;o
that People left their Hou&s;es and carried away their Goods from many Places
which received no Hurt, and whither They afterwards returned again; all
the Fields full of Women and Children, who had made a Shift to bring
thither &s;ome Goods and Conveniences to re&s;t upon, as &s;afer than any Hou&s;es,
where yet They felt &s;uch intolerable Heat and Drought, as if They had<MILESTONE N="20">
been in the Middle of the Fire. The King and the Duke, who rode from
one Place to another, and put them&s;elves into great Dangers among&s;t the
burning and falling Hou&s;es, to give Advice and Direction what was to be
done, underwent as much Fatigue as the meane&s;t, and had as little Sleep
or Re&s;t; and the Faces of all Men appeared gha&s;tly and in the highe&s;t Con|fu&s;ion.
The Country &s;ent in Carts to help tho&s;e mi&s;erable People who had
&s;aved any Goods: And by this Means, and the Help of Coaches, all the neigh|bour
Villages were filled with more People than they could contain, and
more Goods than they could find Room for; &s;o that tho&s;e Fields became
likewi&s;e as full as the other about <HI>London</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter.</HI><MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>IT was ob&s;erved that where the Fire prevailed mo&s;t, when it met with
brick Buildings, if it was not repul&s;ed, it was &s;o well re&s;i&s;ted that it made
a much &s;lower Progre&s;s; and when it had done its Wor&s;t, that the Tim|ber
and all the combu&s;tible Matter fell, it fell down to the Bottom within
the Hou&s;e, and the Walls &s;tood and enclo&s;ed the Fire, and it was burned out
without making a farther Progre&s;s in many of tho&s;e Places; and then the
Vacancy &s;o interrupted the Fury of it, that many Times the two or three
next Hou&s;es &s;tood without much Damage. Be&s;ides the &s;preading, in&s;omuch
as all <HI>London</HI> &s;eemed but one Fire in the Breadth of it, it &s;eemed to con|tinue
in its full Fury a direct Line to the <HI>Thames</HI> Side, all <HI>Cheap&s;ide</HI> from<MILESTONE N="40">
beyond the <HI>Exchange,</HI> through <HI>Fleet&s;treet;</HI> in&s;omuch as for that Breadth,
taking in Both Sides as far as the <HI>Thames,</HI> there was &s;carce a Hou&s;e or
Church &s;tanding from the Bridge to <HI>Dor&s;et-Hou&s;e,</HI> which was burned on
<HI>Tue&s;day</HI> Night after <HI>Baynard's Ca&s;tle.</HI></P>
<P>ON <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> Morning, when the King &s;aw that neither the Fire de|crea&s;ed
nor the Wind le&s;&s;ened, He even de&s;paired of pre&s;erving <HI>Whitehall,</HI>
but was more afraid of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey.</HI> But having ob&s;erved by his
having vi&s;ited all Places, that where there were any vacant Places between
the Hou&s;es, by which the Progre&s;s of the Fire was interrupted, it changed its
Cour&s;e and went to the other Side; He gave Order for pulling down many<MILESTONE N="50">
Hou&s;es about <HI>Whitehall,</HI> &s;ome whereof were newly built and hardly fini&s;hed,
and &s;ent many of his choice Goods by Water to <HI>Hampton-Court;</HI> as mo&s;t of
<PB N="351" REF="355">
the Per&s;ons of Quality in the <HI>Strand,</HI> who had the Benefit of the River,
got Barges and other Ve&s;&s;els, and &s;ent their Furniture for their Hou&s;es to
&s;ome Hou&s;es &s;ome Miles out of the Town. And very many on Both Sides
the <HI>Strand,</HI> who knew not whither to go, and &s;carce what They did, fled
with their Families out of their Hou&s;es into the Streets, that They might
not be within when the Fire fell upon their Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>BUT it plea&s;ed God, contrary to all Expectation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fire de|crea&s;es.</NOTE> that on <HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> about
four or five of the Clock in the Afternoon, the Wind fell: And as in an In&s;tant
the Fire decrea&s;ed, having burned all on the <HI>Thames</HI> Side to the New Buildings
<MILESTONE N="10">of the <HI>Inner-Temple</HI> next to <HI>White-Friars,</HI> and having con&s;umed them, was
&s;topped by that Vacancy from proceeding farther into that Hou&s;e; but laid
Hold on &s;ome old Buildings which joined to <HI>Ram-Alley,</HI> and &s;wept all tho&s;e
into <HI>Fleet Street.</HI> And the other Side being likewi&s;e de&s;troyed to <HI>Fetter-Lane,</HI>
it advanced no farther; but left the other Part of <HI>Fleet Street</HI> to the <HI>Temple-Bar,</HI>
and all the <HI>Strand,</HI> unhurt, but what Damage the Owners of the
Hou&s;es had done to them&s;elves by endeavouring to remove; and it cea&s;ed in
all other Parts of the Town near the &s;ame Time: So that the greate&s;t Care
then was, to keep good Guards to watch the Fire that was upon the
Ground, that it might not break out again. And this was the better per|formed,
<MILESTONE N="20">becau&s;e They who had yet their Hou&s;es &s;tanding had not the
Courage to &s;leep, but watched with much le&s;s Di&s;traction; though the &s;ame
Di&s;temper &s;till remained in the utmo&s;t Extent, &startq;that all this had fallen out
by the Con&s;piracy of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> with the <HI>Papi&s;ts;</HI>&endq; and all Gaols
were filled with tho&s;e who were every Hour apprehended upon that Jea|lou&s;y,
or rather upon &s;ome Evidence that They were guilty of the Crime.
And the People were &s;o &s;otti&s;h, that They believed that all the <HI>French</HI> in the
Town (which no Doubt were a very great Number) were drawn into a Body,
to pro&s;ecute tho&s;e by the Sword who were pre&s;erved from the Fire: And
the Inhabitants of a whole Street have ran in a great Tumult one Way,
<MILESTONE N="30">upon the Rumour that the <HI>French</HI> were marching at the other End of it; &s;o
terrified Men were with their own Apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>WHEN the Night, though far from being a quiet one, had &s;omewhat le&s;|&s;ened
the Con&s;ternation, the fir&s;t Care the King took was, that the Country
might &s;peedily &s;upply Markets in all Places, that They who had &s;aved
them&s;elves from burning might not be in Danger of &s;tarving; and if there
had not been extraordinary Care and Diligence u&s;ed, many would have pe|ri&s;hed
that Way. The va&s;t De&s;truction of Corn, and all other Sorts of
Provi&s;ions, in tho&s;e Parts where the Fire had prevailed, had not only left
all that People de&s;titute of all that was to be eat or drank; but the Bakers
<MILESTONE N="40">and Brewers, which inhabited the other Parts which were unhurt, had for|&s;aken
their Hou&s;es, and carried away all that was portable: In&s;omuch as
many Days pa&s;&s;ed, before They were enough in their Wits and in their
Hou&s;es to fall to their Occupations; and tho&s;e Parts of the Town which
God had &s;pared and pre&s;erved were many Hours without any Thing to eat,
as well as They who were in the Fields. And yet it can hardly be con|ceived,
how great a Supply of all Kinds was brought from all Places within
four and twenty Hours. And which was more miraculous, in four Days,
in all the Fields about the Town, which had &s;eemed covered with tho&s;e
who&s;e Habitations were burned, and with the Goods which They had &s;aved,
<MILESTONE N="50">there was &s;carce a Man to be &s;een: All found Shelter in &s;o &s;hort a Time,
either in tho&s;e Parts which remained of the City and in the Suburbs, or
in the neighbour Villages; all Kind of People expre&s;&s;ing a marvellous
Charity towards tho&s;e who appeared to be undone. And very many, with
<PB N="352" REF="356">
more Expedition than can be conceived, &s;et up little Sheds of Brick and
Timber upon the Ruins of their own Hou&s;es, where They cho&s;e rather to
inhabit than in more convenient Places, though They knew They could
not long re&s;ide in tho&s;e new Buildings.</P>
<P>THE King was not more troubled at any Particular, than at the Ima|gination
which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Hearts of &s;o many, that all this Mi&s;chief had
fallen out by a real and formed Con&s;piracy; which, albeit He &s;aw no Co|lour
to believe, He found very many intelligent Men, and even &s;ome of his
own Council, who did really believe it. Whereupon He appointed the
Privy Council to &s;it both Morning and Evening, to examine all Evidence<MILESTONE N="10">
of that Kind that &s;hould be brought before them, and to &s;end for any Per|&s;ons
who had been committed to Pri&s;on upon &s;ome Evidence that made the
greate&s;t Noi&s;e; and &s;ent for the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice, who was in the Coun|try,
to come to the Town for the better Examination of all Sugge&s;tions and
Allegations of that Kind, there having been &s;ome malicious Report &s;cat|tered
about the Town, &startq;that the Court had &s;o great a Prejudice again&s;t any
Kind of Te&s;timony of &s;uch a Con&s;piracy, that They di&s;countenanced all
Witne&s;&s;es who came before them to te&s;tify what They knew;&endq; which was
without any Colour of Truth. Yet many, who were produced as if
their Te&s;timony would remove all Doubts, made &s;uch &s;en&s;ele&s;s Relations<MILESTONE N="20">
of what They had been told, without knowing the Condition of the Per|&s;ons
who told them, or where to find them, that it was a hard Matter
to forbear &s;miling at their Evidence. Some <HI>Frenchmens</HI> Hou&s;es had been
&s;earched, in which had been found many of tho&s;e Shells for Squibs and
other Fireworks, frequently u&s;ed in Nights of Joy and Triumph; and
the Men were well known, and had lived many Years there by that Trade,
and had no other: And one of the&s;e was the King's Servant, and employed
by the Office of Ordnance for making Grenades of all Kinds, as well for
the Hand as for Mortarpieces. Yet the&s;e Men were looked upon as in the
Number of the Con&s;pirators, and remained &s;till in Pri&s;on till their Neigh|bours<MILESTONE N="30">
&s;olicited for their Liberty. And it cannot be enough wondered at,
that in this general Rage of the People no Mi&s;chief was done to the
Strangers, that no one of them was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated outright, though many were
&s;orely beaten and brui&s;ed.</P>
<P>THERE was a very odd Accident that confirmed many in what They
were inclined to believe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubert's <HI>&s;trange Con|&s;e&s;&s;ion.</HI></NOTE> and &s;tartled others, who thought the Con&s;piracy im|po&s;&s;ible,
&s;ince no Combination not very di&s;cernible and di&s;covered could have
effected that Mi&s;chief, in which the immediate Hand of God was &s;o vi&s;ible.
Among&s;t many <HI>Frenchmen</HI> who had been &s;ent to <HI>Newgate,</HI> there was one
<HI>Hubert,</HI> a young Man of five or &s;ix and twenty Years of Age, the Son of a<MILESTONE N="40">
famous Watchmaker in the City of <HI>Roan;</HI> and this Fellow had wrought in
the &s;ame Profe&s;&s;ion with &s;everal Men in <HI>London,</HI> and had for many Years both
in <HI>Roan</HI> and in <HI>London</HI> been looked upon as di&s;tracted. This Man con|fe&s;&s;ed
&startq;that He had &s;et the fir&s;t Hou&s;e on Fire, and that He had been
hired in <HI>Paris</HI> a Year before to do it: That there were three more com|bined
with him to do the &s;ame Thing, and that They came over toge|ther
into <HI>England</HI> to put it in Execution in the Time of the Plague;
but when They were in <HI>London,</HI> He and two of his Companions went
into <HI>Sweden,</HI> and returned from thence in the latter End of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and
He re&s;olved to undertake it; and that the two others went away into<MILESTONE N="50">
<HI>France.&endq;</HI></P>
<P>THE whole Examination was &s;o &s;en&s;ele&s;s, that the Chief Ju&s;tice, who
was not looked upon as a Man who wanted Rigour, did not believe any
<PB N="353" REF="357">
Thing He &s;aid. He was a&s;ked, &startq;who it was in <HI>Paris</HI> that &s;uborned him
to this Action:&endq; To which He an&s;wered, &startq;that He did not know, having
never &s;een him before;&endq; and in the enlarging upon that Point He con|tradicted
him&s;elf in many Particulars. Being a&s;ked &startq;what Money He had
received to perform a Service of &s;o much Hazard,&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;He had
received but a <HI>Pi&s;tole,</HI> but was promi&s;ed five <HI>Pi&s;toles</HI> more when He &s;hould
have done his Work;&endq; and many &s;uch unrea&s;onable Things, that Nobody
pre&s;ent credited any Thing He &s;aid. However They dur&s;t not &s;light the
Evidence, but put him to a Particular, in which He &s;o fully confirmed all
<MILESTONE N="10">that He had &s;aid before, that They were &s;urpri&s;ed with Wonder, and knew
not afterwards what to &s;ay or think. They a&s;ked him, &startq;if He knew the
Place where He fir&s;t put Fire;&endq; He an&s;wered, &startq;that He knew it very
well, and would &s;hew it to any Body.&endq; Upon this the Chief Ju&s;tice,
and many Aldermen who fate with him, &s;ent a Guard of &s;ub&s;tantial Citi|zens
with the Pri&s;oner, that He might &s;hew them the Hou&s;e; and They
fir&s;t led him to a Place at &s;ome Di&s;tance from it, and a&s;ked him &startq;if that
were it;&endq; to which He an&s;wered pre&s;ently, &startq;No, it was lower, nearer
to the <HI>Thames.&endq;</HI> The Hou&s;e and all which were near it were &s;o covered
and buried in Ruins, that the Owners them&s;elves, without &s;ome infallible
<MILESTONE N="20">Mark, could very hardly have &s;aid where their own Hou&s;es had &s;tood: But
this Man led them directly to the Place, de&s;cribed how it &s;tood, the Shape
of the little Yard, the Fa&s;hion of the Door and Windows, and where He
fir&s;t put the Fire; and all this with &s;uch Exactne&s;s, that They who had
dwelt long near it could not &s;o perfectly have de&s;cribed all Particulars.</P>
<P>THIS &s;ilenced all farther Doubts. And though the Chief Ju&s;tice told the
King, &startq;that all his Di&s;cour&s;e was &s;o disjointed that He did not believe him
guilty;&endq; nor was there one Man who pro&s;ecuted or accu&s;ed him: Yet upon
his own Confe&s;&s;ion, and &s;o &s;en&s;ible a Relation of all that He had done, ac|companied
with &s;o many Circum&s;tances (though without the lea&s;t Shew of
<MILESTONE N="30">Compunction or Sorrow for what He &s;aid He had done, nor yet &s;eeming to
ju&s;tify or to take Delight in it; but being a&s;ked whether He was not &s;orry for
the Wickedne&s;s, and whether He intended to do &s;o much, He gave no
An&s;wer at all, or made Reply to what was &s;aid; and with the &s;ame Tem|per
died),<NOTE PLACE="marg">Upon which He is executed.</NOTE> the Jury found him guilty, and He was executed accordingly.
And though no Man could imagine any Rea&s;on why a Man &s;hould &s;o de&s;|perately
throw away his Life, which He might have &s;aved though He had
been guilty, &s;ince He was only accu&s;ed upon his own Confe&s;&s;ion; yet neither
the Judges nor any pre&s;ent at the Trial did believe him guilty, but that He
was a poor di&s;tracted Wretch weary of his Life, and cho&s;e to part with it
<MILESTONE N="40">this Way. Certain it is, that upon the &s;tricte&s;t Examination that could be
afterwards made by the King's Command, and then by the Diligence of
the Hou&s;e, that upon the general Jealou&s;y and Rumour made a Commit|tee,
that was very diligent and &s;olicitous to make that Di&s;covery, there was
never any probable Evidence (that poor Creature's only excepted) that there
was any other Cau&s;e of that wo&s;ul Fire, than the Di&s;plea&s;ure of God Al|mighty:
The fir&s;t Accident of the Beginning in a Baker's Hou&s;e, where
there was &s;o great a Stock of Faggots, and the Neighbourhood of much
combu&s;tible Matter, of Pitch and Ro&s;in and the like, led it in an In&s;tant
from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e through <HI>Thames Street,</HI> with the Agitation of &s;o ter|rible
<MILESTONE N="50">a Wind to &s;catter and di&s;per&s;e it.</P>
<P>LET the Cau&s;e be what it would, the Effect was very terrible; for above
two Parts of three of that great City were burned to A&s;hes, and tho&s;e the
mo&s;t rich and wealthy Parts of the City, where the greate&s;t Warehou&s;es and
<PB N="354" REF="358">
the be&s;t Shops &s;tood. The <HI>Royal-Exchange</HI> with all the Streets about it,
<HI>Lombard Street, Cheap&s;ide, Paterno&s;ter-Row, St. Paul's</HI> Church, and almo&s;t
all the other Churches in the City, with the <HI>Old Bailey, Ludgate,</HI> all <HI>Paul's
Church-Yard</HI> even to the <HI>Thames,</HI> and the greate&s;t Part of <HI>Fleet Street,</HI> all which
were Places the be&s;t inhabited, were all burned without one Hou&s;e remaining.</P>
<P>THE Value or E&s;timate of what that devouring Fire con&s;umed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ine&s;tima|ble Lo&s;s &s;u&s;|tained by the Fire.</NOTE> over and
above the Hou&s;es, could never be computed in any Degree: For be&s;ides
that the fir&s;t Night (which in a Moment &s;wept away the va&s;t Wealth of
<HI>Thames Street)</HI> there was not any Thing that could be pre&s;erved in Re&s;pect
of the Suddenne&s;s and Amazement (all People being in their Beds till the<MILESTONE N="10">
Fire was in their Hou&s;es, and &s;o could &s;ave Nothing but them&s;elves), the
next Day with the Violence of the Wind increa&s;ed the Di&s;traction; nor did
many believe that the Fire was near them, or that They had Rea&s;on to re|move
their Goods, till it was upon them and rendered it impo&s;&s;ible. Then
it fell out at a Sea&s;on in the Year, the Beginning of <HI>September,</HI> when very
many of the &s;ub&s;tantial Citizens and other wealthy Men were in the Coun|try,
whereof many had not left a Servant in their Hou&s;es, thinking them|&s;elves
upon all ordinary Accidents more &s;ecure in the Goodne&s;s and Kind|ne&s;s
of their Neighbours, than They could be in the Fidelity of a Servant;
and what&s;oever was in &s;uch Hou&s;es was entirely con&s;umed by the Fire, or<MILESTONE N="20">
lo&s;t as to the Owners. And of this <HI>Cla&s;&s;is</HI> of ab&s;ent Men, when the Fire
came where the Lawyers had Hou&s;es, as They had in many Places, e&s;pe|cially
<HI>Serjeants-Inn</HI> in <HI>Fleet Street,</HI> with that Part of the <HI>Inner-Temple</HI> that
was next it and <HI>White-Friars,</HI> there was &s;carce a Man to whom tho&s;e
Lodgings appertained who was in the Town: So that what&s;oever was
there, their Money, Books and Papers, be&s;ides the Evidences of many Mens
E&s;tates depo&s;ited in their Hands, were all burned or lo&s;t, to a very great Va|lue.
But of particular Mens Lo&s;&s;es could never be made any Computation.</P>
<P>IT was an incredible Damage that was and might rationally be com|puted
to be &s;u&s;tained by one &s;mall Company, the Company of Stationers,<MILESTONE N="30">
in Books, Paper, and the other le&s;&s;er Commodities which are vendible in that
Corporation, which amounted to no le&s;s than two hundred thou&s;and Pounds:
In which prodigious Lo&s;s there was one Circum&s;tance very lamentable. All
tho&s;e who dwelt near <HI>Paul's</HI> carried their Goods, Books, Paper, and the like,
as others of greater Trades did their Commodities, into the large Vaults which
were under <HI>St. Paul's</HI> Church, before the Fire came thither: Which Vaults,
though all the Church above the Ground was afterwards burned, with all the
Hou&s;es round about, &s;till &s;tood firm and &s;upported the Foundation, and
pre&s;erved all that was within them; until the Impatience of tho&s;e who had
lo&s;t their Hou&s;es, and what&s;oever They had el&s;e, in the Fire, made them<MILESTONE N="40">
very de&s;irous to &s;ee what They had &s;aved, upon which all their Hopes were
founded to repair the re&s;t.</P>
<P>IT was the fourth Day after the Fire cea&s;ed to flame, though it &s;till
burned in the Ruins, from whence there was &s;till an intolerable Heat,
when the Book&s;ellers e&s;pecially, and &s;ome other Trade&s;men, who had de|po&s;ited
all They had pre&s;erved in the greate&s;t and mo&s;t &s;pacious Vault,
came to behold all their Wealth, which to that Moment was &s;afe: But the
Doors were no &s;ooner opened, and the Air from without fanned the &s;trong
Heat within, but fir&s;t the dryo&s;t and mo&s;t combu&s;tible Matters broke into a
Flame, which con&s;umed all, of what Kind &s;oever, that till then had been<MILESTONE N="50">
unhurt there. Yet They who had committed their Goods to &s;ome le&s;&s;er
Vaults, at a Di&s;tance from that greater, had better Fortune; and having
learned from the &s;econd Ruin of their Friends to have more Patience, at|tended
<PB N="355" REF="359">
till the Rain fell, and extingui&s;hed the Fire in all Places, and cooled
the Air: And then They &s;ecurely opened the Doors, and received all from
thence that They had there.</P>
<P>IF &s;o va&s;t a Damage as two hundred thou&s;and Pounds befell that little
Company of Stationers in Books and Paper and the like, what &s;hall We
conceive was lo&s;t in Cloth (of which the Country Clothiers lo&s;t all that
They had brought up to <HI>Blackwell-Hall</HI> again&s;t <HI>Michaelma&s;s,</HI> which was all
burned with that fair Structure), in Silks of all Kinds, in Linen, and tho&s;e
richer Manufactures? Not to &s;peak of Money, Plate and Jewels, whereof
<MILESTONE N="10">&s;ome were recovered out of the Ruins of tho&s;e Hou&s;es which the Owners took
Care to watch, as containing Somewhat that was worth the looking for,
and in which Deluge there were Men ready enough to fi&s;h.</P>
<P>THE Lord Mayor, though a very hone&s;t Man, was much blamed for
Want of Sagacity in the fir&s;t Night of the Fire, before the Wind gave it
much Advancement: For though He came with great Diligence as &s;oon as
He had Notice of it, and was pre&s;ent with the fir&s;t, yet having never been
u&s;ed to &s;uch Spectacles, his Con&s;ternation was equal to that of other Men,
nor did He know how to apply his Authority to the remedying the pre&s;ent
Di&s;tre&s;s; and when Men who were le&s;s terrified with the Object pre&s;&s;ed him
<MILESTONE N="20">very earne&s;tly, &startq;that He would give Order for the pre&s;ent pulling down
tho&s;e Hou&s;es which were neare&s;t, and by which the Fire climbed to go
farther&endq; (the doing whereof at that Time might probably have prevented
much of the Mi&s;chief that &s;ucceeded), He thought it not &s;afe Coun&s;el,
and made no other An&s;wer, &startq;than that He dur&s;t not do it without the
Con&s;ent of the Owners.&endq; His Want of Skill was the le&s;s wondered at,
when it was known afterwards, that &s;ome Gentlemen of the <HI>Inner-Temple</HI>
would not endeavour to pre&s;erve the Goods which were in the Lodgings of
ab&s;ent Per&s;ons, nor &s;uffer others to do it, &startq;becau&s;e,&endq; They &s;aid, &startq;it was
again&s;t the Law to break up any Man's Chamber.&endq;</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30">THE &s;o &s;udden Repair of tho&s;e formidable Ruins, and the giving &s;o great
Beauty to all Deformity (a Beauty and a Lu&s;tre that City had never before
been acquainted with), is little le&s;s wonderful than the Fire that con&s;umed it.</P>
<P>IT was hoped and expected that this prodigious and univer&s;al Calamity,
for the Effects of it covered the whole Kingdom, would have made Im|pre&s;&s;ion,
and produced &s;ome Reformation in the Licen&s;e of the Court:
For as the Pains the King had taken Night and Day during the Fire,
and the Dangers He had expo&s;ed him&s;elf to, even for the &s;aving the Citi|zens
Goods, had been very notorious, and in the Mouths of all Men, with
good Wi&s;hes and Prayers for him; &s;o his Maje&s;ty had been heard during
<MILESTONE N="40">that Time to &s;peak with great Piety and Devotion of the Di&s;plea&s;ure that
God was provoked to.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King &s;e|riou&s;ly affected with th$$ Ca|lamity.</NOTE> And no Doubt the deep Sen&s;e of it did rai&s;e many
good Thoughts and Purpo&s;es in his Royal Brea&s;t. But He was narrowly
watched and looked to, that &s;uch melancholick Thoughts might not long
po&s;&s;e&s;s him, the Con&s;equence and Effect whereof was like to be more
grievous than that of the Fire it&s;elf; of which that loo&s;e Company that was
too much cheri&s;hed, even before it was extingui&s;hed, di&s;cour&s;ed as of an
Argument for Mirth and Wit to de&s;cribe the Wildne&s;s of the Confu&s;ion all
People were in; in which the Scripture it&s;elf was u&s;ed with equal Liberty,
when They could apply it to their profane Purpo&s;es.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mea&s;ures ta|ken to $word$ &s;uch good $word$ in him.</NOTE> And Mr. <HI>May</HI> pre|&s;umed
<MILESTONE N="50">to a&s;&s;ure the King, &startq;that this was the greate&s;t Ble&s;&s;ing that God had
ever conferred upon him, his Re&s;toration only excepted: For the Walls
and Gates being now burned and thrown down of that rebellious City,
which was always an Enemy to the Crown, his Maje&s;ty would never &s;uf|fer

them to repair and build them up again to be a <HI>Bit in his Mouth and
a Bridle upon his Neck;</HI> but would keep all open, that his Troops might
enter upon them whenever He thought nece&s;&s;ary for his Service, there
being no other Way to govern that rude Multitude but by Force.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS Kind of Di&s;cour&s;e did not plea&s;e the King, but was highly ap|proved
by the Company; and for the Wit and Plea&s;antne&s;s of it was re|peated
in all Companies, infinitely to the King's Di&s;&s;ervice, and corrupted
the Affections of the Citizens and of the Country, who u&s;ed and a&s;&s;umed the
&s;ame Liberty to publi&s;h the Profanene&s;s and Athei&s;m of the Court. And as
Nothing was done there in private, &s;o it was made more publick in Pa&s;quils<MILESTONE N="10">
and Libels, which were as bold with Reflections of the broade&s;t Nature upon
the King him&s;elf, and upon tho&s;e in who&s;e Company He was mo&s;t delighted,
as upon the meane&s;t Per&s;on.</P>
<P>ALL Men of Virtue and Sobriety, of which there were very many in the
King's Family, were grieved and heartbroken with hearing what They could
not choo&s;e but hear, and &s;eeing many Things which They could not avoid
the &s;eeing. There were few of the Council that did not to one another la|ment
the Exce&s;&s;es, which mu&s;t in Time be attended with fatal Con&s;equences,
and for the pre&s;ent did apparently le&s;&s;en the Reverence to the King, that is
the be&s;t Support of his Royalty: But few of them had the Courage to &s;ay<MILESTONE N="20">
that to his Maje&s;ty, which was not &s;o fit to be &s;aid to any Body el&s;e. Nor
can it be denied, that his Maje&s;ty did, upon all Occa&s;ions, receive tho&s;e
Adverti&s;ements from tho&s;e who pre&s;ented them to him, with Patience and
Benignity, and without the lea&s;t Shew of Di&s;plea&s;ure; though the Per&s;ons
concerned endeavoured no one Thing more than to per&s;uade him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And to le&s;&s;on his E&s;teem of the Privy Council.</NOTE> &startq;that
it was the highe&s;t Pre&s;umption imaginable in the Privy Council to be|lieve,
that They had any Juri&s;diction in the Court, or ought to cen&s;ure
the Manners of it.&endq;</P>
<P>NOR were all tho&s;e Endeavours without making &s;ome Impre&s;&s;ion upon
his Maje&s;ty, who rather e&s;teemed &s;ome particular Members of it, than was<MILESTONE N="30">
inclined to believe that the Body of it ought to receive a Reverence from the
People, or be looked upon as a vital Part of the Government: In which
his Maje&s;ty (as hath been often &s;aid before) by the ill Principles He had re|ceived
in <HI>France,</HI> and the accu&s;tomed Liberty of his Bedchamber, was ex|ceedingly
and unhappily mi&s;taken. For by the Con&s;titution of the King|dom,
and the very Laws and Cu&s;toms of the Nation, as the Privy Council
and every Member of it is of the King's &s;ole Choice and Election of him to
that Tru&s;t (for the greate&s;t Office in the State, though conferred likewi&s;e by
the King him&s;elf, doth not qualify the Officer to be of the Privy Council,
or to be pre&s;ent in it, before by a new A&s;&s;ignation that Honour is be&s;towed<MILESTONE N="40">
on him, and that He be &s;worn of the Council); &s;o the Body of it is the
mo&s;t &s;acred, and hath the greate&s;t Authority in the Government of the
State, next the Per&s;on of the King him&s;elf, to whom all other Powers are
equally &s;ubject: And no King of <HI>England</HI> can &s;o well &s;ecure his own ju&s;t
Prerogative, or pre&s;erve it from Violation, as by a &s;trict defending and &s;up|porting
the Dignity of his Privy Council.</P>
<P>WHEN it was too much taken Notice of, that the King him&s;elf had not
that E&s;teem or Con&s;ideration of the Council that was due to it, what They
did or ordered to be done was le&s;s valued by the People; and that Di&s;re&s;|pect
every Day improved by the Want of Gravity and Ju&s;tice and Con&s;tancy<MILESTONE N="50">
in the Proceedings there, the Re&s;olutions of one Day being rever&s;ed or al|tered
the next, either upon &s;ome Whi&s;pers in the King's Ear, or &s;ome new
Fancy in &s;ome of tho&s;e Coun&s;ellors, who were always of one Mind again&s;t
<PB N="357" REF="361">
all former Orders and Precedents; the Pride and in&s;olent Humour of Sir
<HI>William Coventry</HI> taking not &s;o much Delight in any Thing, as to cro&s;s
and oppo&s;e what&s;oever the Chancellor or the Trea&s;urer advi&s;ed, and to re|ver&s;e
what had been ordered upon that Ground. And though He had
&s;ucked his Milk at the Charge of the Law, no Man was &s;o profe&s;&s;ed an
Enemy to it and to the Profe&s;&s;ors of it, and &s;hewed &s;o little Re&s;pect to any
Thing pa&s;&s;ed and granted under the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> but &s;pake again&s;t
it with the &s;ame Confidence as if it had been a common Scroll of no Signifi|cation;
which Kind of Behaviour in a Per&s;on unqualified by any Office to
<MILESTONE N="10">&s;peak much in &s;uch an A&s;&s;embly, as it had never been accu&s;tomed, &s;o it
would have found much Reprehen&s;ion there, if it had not been for Re&s;pect
to the Duke, and if the King him&s;elf had not very often declared him&s;elf to
be of his Opinion, even in Particulars which him&s;elf had cau&s;ed to be pro|po&s;ed
to a contrary Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>ONE Day his Maje&s;ty called the Chancellor to him, and complained
very much of the Licen&s;e that was a&s;&s;umed in the Coffeehou&s;es, which
were the Places where the bolde&s;t Calumnies and Scandals were rai&s;ed, and
di&s;cour&s;ed among&s;t a People who knew not each other, and came together
only for that Communication, and from thence were propagated over the
<MILESTONE N="20">Kingdom; and mentioned &s;ome particular Rumours which had been lately
di&s;per&s;ed from tho&s;e Fountains, which on his own Behalf He was enough
di&s;plea&s;ed with, and a&s;ked him what was to be done in it.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor concurred with him in the Sen&s;e of the Scandal, and
the Mi&s;chief that mu&s;t attend the Impunity of &s;uch Places, where the foule&s;t
Imputations were laid upon the Government, which were held lawful to be
reported and divulged to every Body but to the Magi&s;trates, who might ex|amine
and puni&s;h them; of which there having yet been no Precedent, Peo|ple
generally believed that tho&s;e Hou&s;es had a Charter of Privilege to &s;peak
what They would, without being in Danger to be called in Que&s;tion: And
<MILESTONE N="30">&startq;that it was high Time for his Maje&s;ty to apply &s;ome Remedy to &s;uch a
growing Di&s;ea&s;e, and to reform the Under&s;tanding of tho&s;e who believed
that no Remedy could be applied to it. That it would be fit, either by
a Proclamation to forbid all Per&s;ons to re&s;ort to tho&s;e Hou&s;es, and &s;o to|tally
to &s;uppre&s;s them; or to employ &s;ome Spies, who, being pre&s;ent in
the Conver&s;ation, might be ready to charge and accu&s;e the Per&s;ons who
had talked with mo&s;t Licen&s;e in a Subject that would bear a Complaint;
upon which the Proceedings might be in &s;uch a Manner, as would put an
End to the Confidence that was only mi&s;chievous in tho&s;e Meetings.&endq; The
King liked Both the Expedients, and thought that the la&s;t could not ju&s;tly
<MILESTONE N="40">be made U&s;e of till the former &s;hould give fair Warning; and commanded
him to propo&s;e it that &s;ame Day in Council, that &s;ome Order might be
given in it.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor propo&s;ed it, as He was required, with &s;uch Arguments
as were like to move with Men who knew the Inconveniences which aro&s;e
from tho&s;e Places; and the King him&s;elf mentioned it with Pa&s;&s;ion, as de|rogatory
to the Government, and directed that the Attorney might prepare
a Proclamation for the Suppre&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e Hou&s;es, in which the Board
&s;eemed to agree: When Sir <HI>William Coventry,</HI> who had been heard within
few Days before to inveigh with much Fiercene&s;s again&s;t the Permi&s;&s;ion of
<MILESTONE N="50">&s;o much &s;editious Prattle in the Impunity of tho&s;e Hou&s;es, &s;tood up, and
&s;aid, &startq;that Coffee was a Commodity that yielded the King a good Re|venue,
and therefore it would not be ju&s;t to receive the Duties and inhibit
the Sale of it, which many Men found to be very good for their Health,&endq;
<PB N="358" REF="362">
as if it might not be bought and drank but in tho&s;e licentious Meetings.
&startq;That it had been permitted in <HI>Cromwell's</HI> Time, and that the King's
Friends had u&s;ed more Liberty of Speech in tho&s;e Places than They dur&s;t
do in any other; and that He thought it would be better to leave them
as they were, without running the Hazard of Ill being continued not|with&s;tanding
his Command to the Contrary.&endq; And upon the&s;e Rea&s;ons
his Maje&s;ty was converted, and declined any farther Debate; which put
the Chancellor very much out of Countenance, nor knew He how to be|have
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE Truth is:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel|lor's Intere&s;t declines: Whil&s;t the Courtiers af|fect to repre|&s;ent i$ at the highe&s;t.</NOTE> He had a very hard Province, and found his Credit every<MILESTONE N="10">
Day to decay with the King; whil&s;t They who prevailed again&s;t him u&s;ed
all the Skill and Cunning They had to make it believed, &startq;that his Power
with his Maje&s;ty was as great as it had ever been, and that all tho&s;e
Things which He mo&s;t oppo&s;ed were acted by his Advice.&endq; And whil&s;t
They procured all tho&s;e for whom He had Kindne&s;s, or who profe&s;&s;ed any
Re&s;pect towards him, to be di&s;countenanced and undervalued, and preferred
none but &s;uch who were known to have an Aver&s;ion for him upon Some|what
that He had, or They had been told that He had, ob&s;tructed their
Pretences in; They per&s;uaded Men, &startq;that Nobody had any Credit with
the King to di&s;po&s;e of any Place but He.&endq;<MILESTONE N="20"></P>
<P>THOSE very Men would often profe&s;s to him, &startq;that They were &s;o much
afflicted at the King's Cour&s;e of Life, that They even de&s;paired that He
would be able to ma&s;ter tho&s;e Difficulties which would &s;till pre&s;s him;&endq;
and would then tell him &s;ome Particulars which He him&s;elf had &s;aid or
done, or had been &s;aid or done lately in his own Pre&s;ence, and of which
He had never heard before; which gave him Occa&s;ion often to blame them,
&startq;that They, who had the Opportunity to &s;ee and know many Things which
He had no Notice of or could not take any, and fore&s;aw the Con&s;equence
that did attend them, did yet forbear to u&s;e the Credit They had with his
Maje&s;ty, in adverti&s;ing him what They thought and heard all others &s;ay;&endq;<MILESTONE N="30">
and He offered &startq;to go with them to his Maje&s;ty, and make a lively Repre|&s;entation
to him of the great Decay of his Reputation with the People upon
his exorbitant Exce&s;&s;es, which God could never ble&s;s:&endq; To all which They
were not a&s;hamed to confe&s;s, &startq;that They never had nor dur&s;t &s;peak to his
Maje&s;ty to that Purpo&s;e, or in &s;uch a Dialect.&endq; Indeed They were the
hone&s;ter Men in not doing it, for it had been gro&s;s Hypocri&s;y to have found
Fault with tho&s;e Actions, upon the pur&s;uing whereof They mo&s;t depended;
and the Reformation which They would have been glad to have &s;een, had
no Relation to tho&s;e inordinate and unlawful Appetites, which were the
Root from whence all the other Mi&s;chiefs had their Birth. They did<MILESTONE N="40">
not wi&s;h that the Lady's Authority and Power &s;hould be le&s;&s;ened, much le&s;s
extingui&s;hed; and that which would have been the mo&s;t univer&s;al Ble&s;&s;ing
to the whole Kingdom, would have been received by them as the greate&s;t
Cur&s;e that could befall them.</P>
<P>ONE Day the Chancellor and the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> were together alone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arlington <HI>la|ments to the Chancellor the King's Cour&s;e of Life: The King enters the Room.</HI></NOTE>
and the Secretary according to his Cu&s;tom was &s;peaking &s;oberly of many

&s;uffered thereby; when the King &s;uddenly came into the Room to them,
and after He was fate a&s;ked them what They were talking of; to which
the Chancellor an&s;wered &startq;that He would tell him hone&s;tly and truly, and<MILESTONE N="50">
was not &s;orry for the Opportunity.&endq; And the other looking with a very
troubled Countenance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To whom the Chancellor re|peats the Di&s;|cour&s;e.</NOTE> He proceeded and &s;aid, &startq;that They were &s;peaking
of his Maje&s;ty, and, as They did frequently, were bewailing the un|happy

Life He lived, both with Re&s;pect to him&s;elf, who, by the Exce&s;s
of Plea&s;ures which He indulged to him&s;elf, was indeed without the true
Delight and Reli&s;h of any; and in Re&s;pect to his Government, which He
totally neglected, and of which the Kingdom was &s;o &s;en&s;ible, that it
could not be long before He felt the ill Effects of it. That the People
were well prepared and well inclined to obey; but if They found that
He either would not or could not command, their Temper would quickly
be changed, and He would find le&s;s Obedience in all Places, than was
nece&s;&s;ary for his Affairs: And that it was too evident and vi&s;ible, that He
<MILESTONE N="10">had already lo&s;t very much of the Affection and Reverence the Nation had
for him.&endq;</P>
<P>HE &s;aid, &startq;that this was the Subject They two were di&s;cour&s;ing upon when
his Maje&s;ty entered; and that it is the Argument, upon which all tho&s;e
of his Council with whom He had any Conver&s;ation did every Day en|large,
when They were together, with Grief of Heart, and even with
Tears; and that He hoped that &s;ome of them did, with that Duty that
became them, repre&s;ent to his Maje&s;ty their own Sen&s;e, and the Sen&s;e his
good Subjects had, of his Condition of living, both with Reference to God
who had wrought &s;uch Miracles for him, and expected &s;ome proportionable
<MILESTONE N="20">Return; and with Reference to his People, who were in the highe&s;t Di&s;con|tent.
He doubted all Men did not di&s;charge their Duty this Way; and
&s;ome had confe&s;&s;ed to him <HI>that They dur&s;t not do it le&s;t They might of|fend
him, which</HI> He had a&s;&s;ured them often <HI>that They would not do,
having had &s;o often Experience him&s;elf of his Goodne&s;s in that Re&s;pect;</HI>
and that He had the rather taken this Opportunity to make this Repre|&s;entation
to him in the Pre&s;ence of another, which He had never u&s;ed to
do:&endq; And concluded &startq;with be&s;eeching his Maje&s;ty to believe that which
He had often &s;aid to him, <HI>that no Prince could be more mi&s;erable, nor
could have more Rea&s;on to fear his own Ruin, than He who hath no Ser|vants
<MILESTONE N="30">who dare contradict him in his Opinions, or advi&s;e him again&s;t his In|clinations
how natural &s;oever.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>THE King heard all this and more to the &s;ame Effect with his u&s;ual
Temper (for He was a patient Hearer), and &s;pake &s;en&s;ibly, as if He thought
that much that had been &s;aid was with too much Rea&s;on;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arlington <HI>put: it off with Raillery.</HI></NOTE> when the other,
who wi&s;hed not &s;uch an Effect from the Di&s;cour&s;e, in&s;tead of &s;econding any

and of &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions He had u&s;ed, to fall into Raillery, which was his
be&s;t Faculty; with which He diverted the King from any farther &s;erious Re|flections;
and Both of them grew very merry with the other, and reproached
<MILESTONE N="40">his overmuch Severity, now He grew old and con&s;idered not the Infirmities
of younger Men: Which increa&s;ed the Pa&s;&s;ion He was in, and provoked him
to &s;ay, &startq;that it was ob&s;erved abroad, that it was a Faculty very much im|proved
of late in the Court, to laugh at tho&s;e Arguments They could not
an&s;wer, and which would always be requited with the &s;ame Mirth among&s;t
tho&s;e who were Enemies to it, and therefore it was Pity that it &s;hould be
&s;o much embraced by tho&s;e who pretended to be Friends;&endq; and to u&s;e
&s;ome other, too plain, Expre&s;&s;ions, which it may be were not warily enough
u&s;ed, and which the good Lord forgot not to put the King in Mind of, and
to de&s;cant upon the Pre&s;umption, in a Sea&s;on that was more ripe for &s;uch
<MILESTONE N="50">Reflections, which at the pre&s;ent He forbore to do, and for &s;ome Time after
remembered only in merry Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>THOUGH the King did not yet, nor in a good Time after, appear to
di&s;like the Liberty the Chancellor pre&s;umed to take with him (who often told

too great Advantages again&s;t him; but that the Con&s;cience of having

(a Faculty in which the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> excelled), did much le&s;&s;en
the natural E&s;teem and Reverence He had for the Clergy; and inclined him
to con&s;ider them as a Rank of Men that compounded a Religion for their
own Advantage, and to &s;erve their own Turns. Nor was all He could &s;ay to
him of Weight enough to make Impre&s;&s;ion to the Contrary.</P>
<P>AND then He &s;eemed to think,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King com|plains to the Chancellor of the Liberties taken with his Character.</NOTE> &startq;that Men were bolder in the examining
his Actions and cen&s;uring them, than They ought to be:&endq; And once He
told him, &startq;that He thought He was more &s;evere again&s;t common Infir|mities<MILESTONE N="20">
than He &s;hould be; and that his Wife was not courteous in re|turning
Vi&s;its and Civilities to tho&s;e who paid her Re&s;pect; and that He
expected that all his Friends &s;hould be very kind to tho&s;e who They
knew were much loved by him, and that He thought &s;o much Ju&s;tice
was due to him.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Chancellor, who had never di&s;&s;embled with him, but on the Con|trary
had always endeavoured to per&s;uade him to believe, that Di&s;&s;imulation
was the mo&s;t di&s;hone&s;t and ungentlemanly Quality that could be affected,
an&s;wered him very roundly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel|lor &s;eriou&s;ly remon&s;trates with him.</NOTE> &startq;that He might &s;eem not to under&s;tand his
Meaning, and &s;o make no Reply to the Di&s;cour&s;e He had made: But that<MILESTONE N="30">
He under&s;tood it all, and the Meaning of every Word of it; and there|fore
that it would not become him to &s;uffer his Maje&s;ty to depart with an
Opinion, that what He had &s;aid would produce any Alteration in his Be|haviour
towards him, or Reformation of his Manners towards any other
Per&s;ons.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;THAT for the fir&s;t Part, the Liberty Men took to &s;peak of him
and to cen&s;ure his Actions, He was of the Opinion that it was a very great
Pre&s;umption, and a Crime very fit to be puni&s;hed: For let it be true or
fal&s;e, Men had been always &s;everely cha&s;ti&s;ed for that Licen&s;e, becau&s;e it
tended to Sedition. However He put his Maje&s;ty in Mind of the Exam|ple<MILESTONE N="40">
of <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Macedon,</HI> who, when one of his Servants accu&s;ed a Per|&s;on
of Condition to him of having &s;poken ill of him, and offered to go
him&s;elf to the Magi&s;trate and make Proof of it, an&s;wered him; <HI>that the
Per&s;on He accu&s;ed was a Man of the greate&s;t Reputation of Wi&s;dom and
Integrity in the Kingdom, and therefore it would be fit in the fir&s;t Place to
examine, whether him&s;elf</HI> (the King) <HI>had not done Somewhat by which He
had de&s;erved to be &s;o &s;poken of:</HI> Indeed this Way the be&s;t Men would
often receive Benefit from their wor&s;t Enemies. For the Matter it&s;elf,&endq;
He &s;aid, &startq;He need make no Apology: For that it was notoriou&s;ly known,
that He had con&s;tantly given it in Charge to all the Judges, to make di|ligent<MILESTONE N="50">
Inquiry into Mi&s;demeanours and Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of that Magnitude,
and to puni&s;h tho&s;e who were guilty in the mo&s;t exemplary Manner;
and that He took not more Pains any Way, than to pre&s;erve in the
<PB N="361" REF="365">
Hearts of the People that Veneration for his Per&s;on that is due to his Dig|nity,
and to per&s;uade many who appeared afflicted with the Reports
They heard, <HI>that They heard more than was true; and that the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing
all Reports of that Kind was the Duty of every good Subject, and would
contribute more towards the reforming any Thing that in Truth is ami&s;s,
than the propagating the Scandal by &s;preading it in Di&s;cour&s;es could do.</HI>
However that all this which was his Duty, and but his Duty, did not
make it unfit for him, or any other under his Obligations, in fit Sea&s;ons
to make a lively Repre&s;entation to his Maje&s;ty of what is done, and how
<MILESTONE N="10">&s;ecretly &s;oever, that cannot be ju&s;tified or excu&s;ed; and of the Untruths
and Scandals which &s;pring from thence to his irreparable Di&s;honour and
Prejudice.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;FOR the other Part, of Want of Ceremony and Re&s;pect to tho&s;e who
were loved and e&s;teemed by his Maje&s;ty, He might likewi&s;e avoid en|larging
upon that Subject, by putting his Maje&s;ty in Mind, that He had
the Honour to &s;erve him in a Province that excu&s;ed him from making Vi|&s;its,
and exempted him from all Ceremonies of that Kind. But He would
not &s;helter him&s;elf under &s;uch a general Defence, when He perceived that
his Maje&s;ty had in the Reprehen&s;ion a particular Intention: And there|fore
<MILESTONE N="20">He confe&s;&s;ed ingenuou&s;ly to his Maje&s;ty, that He did deny him&s;elf
many Liberties, which in them&s;elves might be innocent enough and
agreeable to his Per&s;on, becau&s;e they would not be decent or agreeable
to the Office He held, which obliged him for his Maje&s;ty's Honour, and
to pre&s;erve him from the Reproach of having put a light Per&s;on into a
grave Place, to have the more Care of his own Carriage and Behaviour.
And that, as it would reflect upon his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf, if his Chancellor
was known or thought to be of dif&s;olute and debauched Manners, which
would make him as uncapable as unworthy to do him Service; &s;o it would
be a Blemi&s;h and Taint upon him to give any Countenance, or to pay
<MILESTONE N="30">more than ordinary, cur&s;ory and unavoidable Civilities, to Per&s;ons in|famous
for any Vice, for which by the Laws of God and Man They
ought to be odious, and to be expo&s;ed to the Judgment of the Church
and State. And that He would not for his own Sake and for his own
Dignity, to how low a Condition &s;oever He might be reduced, &s;toop to
&s;uch a Conde&s;cen&s;ion as to have the lea&s;t Commerce, or to make the Ap|plication
of a Vi&s;it, to any &s;uch Per&s;on, for any Benefit or Advantage that
it might bring to him. He did be&s;eech his Maje&s;ty not to believe, that
He hath a Prerogative to declare Vice Virtue; or to qualify any Per&s;on
who lives in a Sin and avows it, again&s;t which God him&s;elf hath pro|nounced
<MILESTONE N="40">Damnation, for the Company and Conver&s;ation of innocent and
worthy Per&s;ons. And that whatever low Obedience, which was in Truth
gro&s;s Flattery, &s;ome People might pay to what They believed would be
grateful to his Maje&s;ty, They had in their Hearts a perfect Dete&s;tation of
the Per&s;ons They made Addre&s;s to: And that for his Part He was long
re&s;olved that his Wife &s;hould not be one of tho&s;e Courtiers; and that He
would him&s;elf much le&s;s like her Company, if She put her&s;elf into theirs
who had not the &s;ame Innocence.&endq;</P>
<P>THE King was not the more plea&s;ed for the Defence He made, and did
not di&s;&s;emble his Di&s;like of it, without any other Sharpne&s;s, than by telling
<MILESTONE N="50">him &startq;that He was in the Wrong, and had an Under&s;tanding different from
all other Men who had Experience in the World.&endq; And it is mo&s;t cer|tain,
it was an avowed Doctrine, and with great Addre&s;s daily in&s;inuated
to the King, &startq;that Princes had many Liberties which private Per&s;ons have
<PB N="362" REF="366">
not; and that a Lady of Honour who dedicates her&s;elf only to plea&s;e a
King, and continues faithful to him, ought not to be branded with any
Name or Mark of Infamy, but hath been always looked upon by all Per|&s;ons
wellbred as worthy of Re&s;pect:&endq; And to this Purpo&s;e the Hi&s;tory of
all the Amours of his Grandfather were carefully pre&s;ented to him, and with
what Indignation He &s;uffered any Di&s;re&s;pect towards any of his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>BUT of all the&s;e Artifices the Chancellor had no Apprehen&s;ion, out of
the Confidence He had in the Integrity of the King's Nature; and that
though He might be &s;wayed to &s;acrifice his pre&s;ent Affections to his Appe|tite,
He could never be prevailed upon to entertain a real Su&s;picion of his<MILESTONE N="10">
very pa&s;&s;ionate Affection and Duty to his Per&s;on. That which gave him
mo&s;t Trouble, and many Times made him wi&s;h him&s;elf in any private Con|dition
&s;eparated from the Court, was that Unfixedne&s;s and Irre&s;olution of
Judgment that was natural to all his Family of the Male Line, which often
expo&s;ed them all to the Importunities of bold, and to the Snares of crafty,
Men.</P>
<P>ONE Day the King and the Duke came to the Chancellor together; and
the King told him with a very vi&s;ible Trouble in his Countenance, &startq;that
They were come to confer and advi&s;e with him upon an Affair of Im|portance,
which exceedingly di&s;quieted them Both.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>One</HI> Talbot, <HI>an</HI> Iri&s;hman, <HI>de&s;igns to a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;inate the Duke of</HI> Or|mond.</NOTE> That <HI>Dick Talbot</HI>&endq;<MILESTONE N="20">
(which was the familiar Appellation, according to the ill Cu&s;tom of the
Court, that mo&s;t Men gave him) &startq;had a Re&s;olution to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the Duke
of <HI>Ormond.</HI> That He had &s;worn in the Pre&s;ence of two or three Per&s;ons
of Honour, <HI>that He would do it in the Revenge of &s;ome Injuries which,</HI> He
pretended, <HI>He had done his Family: That He had much rather fight with
him, which He knew the Duke would be willing enough to do; but That He
&s;hould never be able to bring to pa&s;s; and therefore He would take his Re|venge
in any Way that &s;hould offer it&s;elf.</HI> And every Body knew that the
Man had Courage and Wickedne&s;s enough to attempt any Thing like it.
That the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> knew well enough that the Fellow threatened<MILESTONE N="30">
it, and was like enough to act it; but that He thought it below him to
apprehend it: And that his Maje&s;ty came to the Notice of it by the Earl
of <HI>Clancarty,</HI> to whom Sir <HI>Robert Talbot,</HI> the elder Brother of the other,
told it, to the End that the Earl might give the Duke Notice of it, and
find &s;ome Way to prevent it; and the Earl had that Day informed the
King of it, as the be&s;t Way He could think of to prevent it.&endq; His Ma|je&s;ty
&s;aid, &startq;there remained no Doubt to be made of the Truth of it; for
there were two or three more of unque&s;tionable Credit who had heard him
u&s;e the &s;ame Expre&s;&s;ions: And that He had fir&s;t &s;poken with his Bro|ther,
who&s;e Servant He was, whom He found equally incen&s;ed as him|&s;elf;<MILESTONE N="40">
and that They came immediately together to con&s;ult with him what
was to be done.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Chancellor knew all the Brothers well, and was believed to have
too much Prejudice to them all.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Account of this Man's Family: With the Characters of the $word$ Brothers.</NOTE> They were all of an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Family but of

was in &s;o many hundred Years for the mo&s;t Part degenerated into the Man|ners
of the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> and ro&s;e and mingled with them in the late Rebellion:
And of this Family there were two di&s;tinct Families, who had competent
E&s;tates, and lived in many De&s;cents in the Rank of Gentlemen of Quality;<MILESTONE N="50">
and tho&s;e Brothers were all the Sons, or the Grand&s;ons, of one who was a Judge
in <HI>Ireland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sir</HI> $word$ Talbot, <HI>the $word$</HI></NOTE> and e&s;teemed a learned Man. The elde&s;t was Sir <HI>Robert Talbot,</HI>
who was by much the be&s;t; that is, the re&s;t were much wor&s;e Men: A Man,
<PB N="363" REF="367">
whom the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> mo&s;t e&s;teemed of tho&s;e who had been in Rebel|lion,
as one who had le&s;s Malice than mo&s;t of the re&s;t, and had recom|mended
to the King as a Per&s;on fit for his Favour. But becau&s;e He did
not a&s;k all on his Behalf, which He mu&s;t have done for a Man entirely inno|cent,
this Refu&s;al was looked upon as the highe&s;t Di&s;obligation.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd Brother was a <HI>Je&s;uit,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Peter <HI>the &s;e|cond, a</HI> Je|&s;uit.</NOTE> who had been very trouble&s;ome to the
King abroad, and had behaved him&s;elf in &s;o in&s;olent a Manner, that his Ma|je&s;ty
had forbidden him his Court; after which He went into <HI>England,</HI> and
applied him&s;elf to the ruling Power there, and was by that &s;ent into <HI>Spain,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="10">at the Time when the Treaty was at <HI>Fuentarabia</HI> between the two Crowns,
to procure that <HI>England</HI> might be included in that Peace, and the King ex|cluded,
and not to be &s;uffered to remain in <HI>Flanders.</HI> Of all which his
Maje&s;ty having Adverti&s;ement, &s;ent po&s;itive Orders to Sir <HI>Harry Bennet</HI> his
Re&s;ident then in <HI>Madrid</HI> to complain of him, and to de&s;ire <HI>Don Lewis de
Haro,</HI> that He might receive no Countenance in that Court. But the <HI>Je|&s;uit</HI>
had better and more powerful Recommendation; and was not only wel|come
there, but (which was very &s;trange, con&s;idering his Talent of Under|&s;tanding)
in a &s;hort Time got &s;o much Intere&s;t in the Re&s;ident, that He
received him into all Kind of Familiarity and Tru&s;t, and undertook to re|concile
<MILESTONE N="20">the King to him, and was as good as his Word: And from the
Time of his Maje&s;ty's Return, or rather from the Return of Sir <HI>Harry Ben|net,</HI>
He was as much and as bu&s;y in the Court as if He were a dome&s;tick
Servant. And after the Queen came to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> He was admitted one of
her Almoners; and walked with the &s;ame or more Freedom in the King's
Hou&s;e (and in Clergy Habit) than any of his Maje&s;ty's Chaplains did, who
did not pre&s;ume to be &s;een in the Galleries and other re&s;erved Rooms,
where He was conver&s;ant with the &s;ame Confidence as if He were of the
Bedchamber.</P>
<P>THE third Brother was <HI>Gilbert,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gilbert <HI>the third, called Colonel</HI> Tal|bot.</NOTE> who was called Colonel <HI>Talbot</HI> from
<MILESTONE N="30">&s;ome Command He had with the Rebels again&s;t the King. And He had
likewi&s;e been with the King in <HI>Flanders,</HI> that is, had lived in <HI>Antwerp</HI> and
<HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> whil&s;t the King was there; and being a half-witted Fellow did not
meddle with any Thing nor angered any Body, but found a Way to get
good Cloaths and to play, and was looked upon as a Man of Courage,
having fought a Duel or two with &s;tout Men.</P>
<P>THE fourth Brother was a <HI>Franci&s;can Friar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thomas <HI>the fourth, a</HI> Fran|ci&s;can Friar.</NOTE> of Wit enough, but of &s;o
notorious Debauchery, that He was frequently under &s;evere Di&s;cipline by the

<MILESTONE N="40">But not being able to live there, He was forced to return and put
on his abhorred Habit, which He always called his <HI>Fool's Coat,</HI> and came
&s;eldom into tho&s;e Places where He was known, and &s;o wandered into <HI>Ger|many</HI>

King was; and &s;o He came to <HI>Cologne</HI> and <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> and <HI>Bruges,</HI> and being
a merry Fellow, was the more made of for laughing at and contemning his
Brother the <HI>Je&s;uit,</HI> who had not &s;o good natural Parts, though by his Edu|cation
He had more Sobriety, and lived without Scandal in his Manners.
He went by the Name of <HI>Tom Talbot,</HI> and after the King's Return was in
<HI>London</HI> in his <HI>Man's Cloaths</HI> (as He called them), with the natural Li|cen&s;e
<MILESTONE N="50">of an <HI>Iri&s;h Friar</HI> (which are a People, for the mo&s;t Part, of the whole
Creation the mo&s;t &s;orti&s;h and the mo&s;t brutal), and again&s;t his Obedience,
and all Orders of his Superiours, who interdicted him to &s;ay Ma&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="368">
THE fifth Brother was this <HI>Dick Talbot,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Richard <HI>the fifth, the Per|&s;on concerned.</HI></NOTE> who gave the King and the
Duke the Trouble mentioned before. He was brought into <HI>Flanders</HI> fir&s;t
by <HI>Daniel O Neile,</HI> as one who was willing to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate <HI>Cromwell;</HI> and
He made a Journey into <HI>England</HI> with that Re&s;olution not long before
his Death, and after it returned into <HI>Flanders</HI> ready to do all that He
&s;hould be required. He was a very hand&s;ome young Man, wore good
Cloaths, and was without Doubt of a clear, ready Courage, which was Vir|tue
enough to recommend a Man to the Duke's good Opinion; which,
with more Expedition than could be expected, He got to that Degree, that
He was made of his Bedchamber; and, from that Qualification, embarked<MILESTONE N="10">
him&s;elf after the King's Return in the Pretences of the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> with &s;uch an
unu&s;ual Confidence, and upon private Contracts with very &s;candalous Cir|cum&s;tances,
that the Chancellor had &s;ometimes at the Council-Table been
obliged to give him &s;evere Reprehen&s;ions, and often de&s;ired the Duke to
withdraw his Countenance from him. He had likewi&s;e declared very loudly
again&s;t the <HI>Je&s;uit,</HI> and, though He had made many Addre&s;&s;es unto him by
Letters and by &s;ome Friends who had Credit with him, would never from
the Time of the King's Return be per&s;uaded to &s;peak with him, and had
once prevailed with the King &s;o far, that He was forbid to come to the
Court; but He had a Friend, who after &s;ome Time got that Re&s;traint off<MILESTONE N="20">
again. The Chancellor had likewi&s;e ob&s;erved the <HI>Friar</HI> to be too fre|quently
in the Galleries, and &s;ometimes drunk there, and cau&s;ed him to
be forbid to come into the Court: And the elde&s;t Brother, towards whom
He had rather Kindne&s;s than Prejudice, finding many Ob&s;tructions in his
Pretences, was per&s;uaded to think him not his Friend. And &s;o He got the
Reproach of being an Enemy to the whole Family.</P>
<P>THIS Con&s;ideration did really affect the Chancellor, &s;o that He appeared
more re&s;erved and more wary in this Particular propo&s;ed by the King and
by the Duke, than He u&s;ed to be. He &s;aid, &startq;that in many Re&s;pects He was
not &s;o fit to advi&s;e in this Particular as other Men were. Though this<MILESTONE N="30">
Man's Behaviour was &s;o &s;candalous that it de&s;erved exemplary Puni&s;hment,
yet He did not conceive any pre&s;ent Danger from it: That He would deny
it and repent it, and give any other Satisfaction that would be required or
a&s;&s;igned; and then his Maje&s;ty and the Duke would be prevailed with to
take off their Di&s;plea&s;ure. And therefore it would be better not to make
&s;uch a Matter publick, which, con&s;idering the Per&s;on and the Circum|&s;tances,
would make a deep Impre&s;&s;ion upon the Minds of all wi&s;e Men;
than, after the World takes Notice of it, to pa&s;s it over with a light and
ordinary Puni&s;hment.&endq; The King interrupted him as He was going on,
and told him, &startq;there was no Danger of that, and that He would deal<MILESTONE N="40">
freely with him. That as the Offence was in it&s;elf unpardonable, &s;o He
and his Brother were re&s;olved to take this Opportunity and Occa&s;ion to
free them&s;elves from the Importunity of the whole Family: That all the
Brothers were naughty Fellows, and had no good Meaning.&endq; And there|upon
his Maje&s;ty enlarged with much Sharpne&s;s upon the <HI>Je&s;uit</HI> and <HI>Friar,</HI>
with Charges upon Both very weighty and unan&s;werable; and the Duke
upon this Man who was the Subject of the Debate: And Both concluded,
that They &s;hould be in great Ea&s;e by the Ab&s;ence of all of them, which
&s;hould be enjoined as &s;oon as a Re&s;olution &s;hould be taken in this Par|ticular.&endq;<MILESTONE N="50"></P>
<P>THE Chancellor knew that there was Somewhat el&s;e, which was not &s;o
fit to be mentioned, that had offended them Both as much; and thought He
had Rea&s;on to believe that They would be Both re&s;olute in the Puni&s;hment,
<PB N="365" REF="369">
and that They had deliberated it too long to depart from the Pro&s;ecution.
He therefore advi&s;ed, &startq;that the Gentleman &s;hould be pre&s;ently apprehended
and examined upon the Words, which &s;ome Witne&s;s &s;hould be ready to
affirm: And that thereupon He &s;hould be &s;ent to the <HI>Tower,</HI> and the
next Day that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould inform the Privy Council of the Whole,
which without Que&s;tion would give Direction to his Attorney General to
pro&s;ecute this &s;oul Mi&s;demeanour in &s;uch a Manner, that &s;hould put this
Gentleman in &s;uch a Condition, that He &s;hould not trouble the Court
with his Attendance; and other Men &s;hould by his Example find, that
<MILESTONE N="10">their Tongues are not their own, to be employed according to their own
malicious Plea&s;ures.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Per&s;on was the &s;ame Night &s;ent to the <HI>Tower;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He is &s;ent to the</HI> Tower <HI>by the Chancel|lor's Advice.</HI></NOTE> and both the King
and the Duke declared them&s;elves, in the Pre&s;ence of their Servants and
many others, to be as highly offended, and as po&s;itively re&s;olved to take as
much Vengeance upon the impudent Pre&s;umption of the Offender as the
Rigour of the Law would inflict, as ever They had done upon any Occur|rence
and Accident in their Lives: And if They had had Per&s;ons enough
about them, who out of a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of their Honour would have con|firmed
them in the Judgment They were of, it would have been in No|body's
<MILESTONE N="20">Power to have &s;haken them. But as from the fir&s;t Day of his Com|mitment,
the Servants near the Per&s;on both of the King and Duke pre|&s;umed,
again&s;t all ancient Order (which made it a Crime in any to per|form
tho&s;e Civilities to Per&s;ons declared to be under his Maje&s;ty's Di&s;plea|&s;ure),
to vi&s;it Mr. <HI>Talbot,</HI> and to cen&s;ure tho&s;e who had advi&s;ed his Com|mitment;
&s;o after &s;ome few Days, when They thought the Duke's Pa&s;&s;ion
in &s;ome Degree abated, the Lord <HI>Berkley</HI> confidently told the Duke, &startq;that
He &s;uffered much in the Opinion of the World, in permitting a Servant
of &s;o near Relation to be committed to Pri&s;on for a few ha&s;ty and unad|vi&s;ed
Words, to which He had been provoked; and that it was well
<MILESTONE N="30">enough known that it was by the Contrivement and Advice of the Chan|cellor,
who was taken Notice of to be an Enemy to that whole Family,
nor any great Friend to any of his Highne&s;s's Servants; and if He had
that Credit to remove any of them from his Per&s;on, there would in a
&s;hort Time be few of them found in his Court.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS was &s;econded by all the Standers by; and though it did not &s;ud|denly
work its Effect, yet the continual pre&s;&s;ing it by Degrees weakened
the Re&s;olution: And the &s;ame Offices being with equal Importunity per|formed
towards the King, and with the more Zeal after it was publi&s;hed that
the Whole was done by the Chancellor's Procurement; both his Maje&s;ty
<MILESTONE N="40">and his Highne&s;s grew weary of their Severity, and, upon Conference to|gether,
re&s;olved to interpo&s;e with the Duke for his Remi&s;&s;ion, who di&s;dained
to make him&s;elf a Pro&s;ecutor in &s;uch a Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">But &s;oon re|lea&s;ed by the Artifice of the Chancellor's Enemies.</NOTE> And &s;o the Pri&s;oner
returned to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> with the Advantage which Men who have been un|ju&s;tly
impri&s;oned u&s;ually receive: And all Men thought He triumphed over
the Chancellor, who, how unconcerned &s;oever, knew every Day the le&s;s
how to behave him&s;elf. And this unhappy Con&s;titution grew &s;o notorious
(for there were too many In&s;tances of it), that all Men grew le&s;s re&s;olute in
Matters which concerned the King and drew the Di&s;plea&s;ure of others upon
them, which was like to prove unprofitable to them.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50">ACCORDING to their la&s;t Prorogation the Parliament convened again upon
the one and twentieth of <HI>September;</HI> when the King told them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment $word$. The King's $word$.</NOTE> &startq;that He
was very glad to meet &s;o many of them together again, and thanked God
for their Meeting together again in that Place.&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;little Time had
<PB N="366" REF="370">
pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince They were almo&s;t in De&s;pair of having that Place left to
meet in. They &s;aw the di&s;mal Ruins the Fire had made; and Nothing
but a Miracle of God's Mercy could have pre&s;erved what was left from
the &s;ame De&s;truction.&endq;</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty told them, &startq;He need make no Excu&s;e to them for having
di&s;pen&s;ed with their Attendance in <HI>April;</HI> He was confident They all
thanked him for it: The Truth is, He de&s;ired to put them to as little
Trouble as He could; and He could tell them truly, He de&s;ired to put
them to as little Co&s;t as was po&s;&s;ible. He wi&s;hed with all his Heart that
He could bear the whole Charge of the War him&s;elf, and that his Sub|jects<MILESTONE N="10">
&s;hould reap the whole Benefit of it to them&s;elves. But He had two
great and powerful Enemies, who u&s;ed all the Ways They could, fair
and &s;oul, to make all the World to concur with them; and the War was
more chargeable by that Conjunction, than any Body thought it would
have been. He needed not tell them the Succe&s;s of the Summer, in
which God had given them great Succe&s;s; and no Que&s;tion the Enemy
had undergone great Lo&s;&s;es; and if it had plea&s;ed God to have withheld
his late Judgment by Fire, He had been in no ill Condition.&endq; His Ma|je&s;ty
confe&s;&s;ed, &startq;that They had given him very large Supplies for the car|rying
on the War: And yet,&endq; He told them, &startq;that if He had not, by<MILESTONE N="20">
anticipating his own Revenue, rai&s;ed a very great Sum of Money, He had
not been able to have &s;et out the Fleet the la&s;t Spring; and He had &s;ome
Hope upon the &s;ame Credit to be able to pay off the great Ships as they
&s;hould come in. They would con&s;ider what was to be done next, when
They were well informed of the Expen&s;e: And He would leave it to their
Wi&s;doms, to find out the be&s;t Expedients for the carrying on the War
with as little Burden to the People as was po&s;&s;ible.&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;He would
add no more than to put them in Mind, that their Enemies were very
in&s;olent; and if They were able the la&s;t Year to per&s;uade their mi&s;erable
People whom They mi&s;led, <HI>that the Contagion had &s;o wa&s;ted the Nation,<MILESTONE N="30">
and impoveri&s;hed the King, that He would not be able to &s;et out any Fleet;</HI>
how would They be exalted with this la&s;t Impoveri&s;hment of the City,
and contemn all rea&s;onable Conditions of Peace? And therefore He could
not doubt but that They would provide accordingly.&endq;</P>
<P>INDEED the King did not till now under&s;tand the Damage He had &s;u&s;|tained
by the Plague, much le&s;s what He mu&s;t &s;u&s;tain from the Fire.
Monies could neither be collected nor borrowed where the Plague had pre|vailed,
which was over all the City and over a great Part of the Country;
the Collectors dur&s;t not go to require it or receive it. Yet the Fountains
remained yet clear, and the Waters would run again: But this late Confla|gration<MILESTONE N="40">
had dried up or &s;o &s;topped the very Fountains, that there was no
Pro&s;pect when they would flow again. The two great Branches of the
Revenue, the Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;e, which was the great and almo&s;t inex|hau&s;tible
Security to borrow Money upon, were now bankrupt, and would
neither bring in Money nor &s;upply Credit: All the Mea&s;ures by which Com|putations
had been made were &s;o broken, that they could not be brought to
meet again. By a Medium of the con&s;tant Receipts it had been depended
upon, that what had been borrowed upon that Fund would by this Time
have been fully &s;atisfied with all the Intere&s;t, whereby the Money would have
been replaced in the Hands to which it was due, which would have been<MILESTONE N="50">
glad to have laid it out again; and the Security would have remained &s;till in
Vigour to be applied to any other urgent Occa&s;ions: But now the Plague
had routed all tho&s;e Receipts, e&s;pecially in <HI>London,</HI> where the great Con|duits
<PB N="367" REF="371">
of tho&s;e Receipts &s;till ran. The Plague and the War had &s;o totally
broken and di&s;tracted tho&s;e Receipts, that the Farmers of either had not
received enough to di&s;charge the con&s;tant Burden of the Officers, and were
&s;o far from paying any Part of the Principal that was &s;ecured upon it, that
it left the Intere&s;t unpaid to &s;well the Principal. And now this Deluge by
Fire had di&s;&s;ipated the Per&s;ons, and de&s;troyed the Hou&s;es, which were liable
to the Reimbur&s;ement of all Arrears; and the very Stocks were con&s;umed
which &s;hould carry on and revive the Trade. And the third next con&s;i|derable
Branch of the Revenue, the Chimney-Money, was determined; and
<MILESTONE N="10">the City mu&s;t be rebuilt before any Body could be required to pay for his
Chimnies.</P>
<P>THIS was the true State of the Crown, if all other Inconveniences and
ca&s;ual Expen&s;es had been away, and all Application to Things &s;erious had
been made by all Per&s;ons concerned. And this woful Pro&s;pect was in View
when the Parliament met again; which came not together with the better
Countenance by &s;eeing all Hopes abroad with &s;o &s;ad an A&s;pect, and all
Things at Home (that troubled them much more) appear &s;o de&s;perate in
many Re&s;pects. Yet within few Days after the King had &s;poken to them,
the Hou&s;e of Commons beings mo&s;t filled with the King's Servants, the
<MILESTONE N="20">Gentlemen of the Country being not yet come, there was a faint Vote pro|cured,
&startq;that They would give a Supply to the King proportionable to his
Wants,&endq; without mentioning any Sum, or which Way it &s;hould be rai&s;ed:
Nor from that Minute did They make the lea&s;t Reflection upon that Engage|ment
in many Months after. Whil&s;t the Enemies, much more exalted than
ever, believed, as They had good Cau&s;e, that They &s;hould reap a much
greater Benefit by the Burning of <HI>London</HI> than They had from the Contagion.</P>
<P>WHEN the Numbers of the Members increa&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;contents in the Hou&s;e of Commons.</NOTE> the Parliament appeared
much more chagrined than it had hitherto done; and though They made
the &s;ame Profe&s;&s;ions of Affection and Duty to the King They had ever
<MILESTONE N="30">done, They did not conceal the very ill Opinion They had of the Court and
the continual Riotings there: And the very idle Di&s;cour&s;es of &s;ome (who
were much countenanced) upon the mi&s;erable Event of the Fire made them
even believe, that the former Jealou&s;ies of the City, when They &s;aw their
Hou&s;es burning at &s;uch a Di&s;tance from each other, were not without &s;ome
Foundation, nor without ju&s;t Apprehen&s;ion of a Con&s;piracy, and that it
had not been diligently enough examined;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Committee appointed to inquire into the Cau&s;es of the Fire.</NOTE> and therefore They appointed a
Committee, with large Authority to &s;end for and examine all Per&s;ons who
could give any Information concerning it.</P>
<P>WHEN any Mention was made of the Declaration They had &s;o lately
<MILESTONE N="40">pa&s;&s;ed, for giving the King Supply, and &startq;that it was high Time to di&s;|patch
it, that all nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ions might be made for the &s;etting out
a Fleet again&s;t the Spring;&endq; it was an&s;wered with Pa&s;&s;ion, &startq;that the
King's Wants mu&s;t be made fir&s;t to appear before any Supply mu&s;t be di&s;|cour&s;ed
of: That there were already &s;uch va&s;t Sums of Money given to the
King, that there was none left in the Country; nor could any Commo|dities
there, upon which They &s;hould rai&s;e wherewith to pay their Taxes,
be &s;old for Want of Money, which was all brought to <HI>London in Specie,</HI>
and none left to carry on the Commerce and Trade in the Country,
where They could not &s;ell their Corn or their Cattle or their Wool for
<MILESTONE N="50">Half the Value.&endq;</P>
<P>THEY who had not fate in the Parliament at <HI>Oxford</HI> were exceedingly
vexed, that there had been &s;o much given there, &s;o &s;oon after the two Mil|lions
and a Half had been granted; and &s;aid, &startq;if the King wanted again
<PB N="368" REF="372">
already, that He mu&s;t have been abominably cheated, which was &s;it to be
examined. That the Number of the Ships, which had been &s;et out by the
King in &s;everal Fleets &s;ince the Beginning of this War, was no Secret; and
that there are Men enough who are acquainted with the Charge of &s;etting
out and manning and victualling Ships, and can make thereby a rea&s;on|able
Computation what this va&s;t Expen&s;e can amount to: And that They
cannot but conclude, that if his Maje&s;ty hath been hone&s;tly dealt with,
there mu&s;t remain &s;till a very great Proportion of Money to carry on the
War, without Need of impo&s;ing more upon the People, till They are
better able to bear it. And therefore that it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that<MILESTONE N="10">
all tho&s;e, through who&s;e Hands the Money had pa&s;&s;ed, &s;hould fir&s;t give
an exact Account of what They had received, and what and how They
had di&s;bur&s;ed it: And when that &s;hould appear, it would be &s;ea&s;onable
to demand an Addition of Supply, which would be cheerfully granted.&endq;</P>
<P>AND for the better Expedition of this (for every Body confe&s;&s;ed that the
Time pre&s;&s;ed) it was propo&s;ed, &startq;that forthwith a Bill &s;hould be prepared,
which &s;hould pa&s;s into an Act of Parliament, in which &s;uch Commi&s;|&s;ioners
&s;hould be appointed as the Hou&s;es &s;hould think fit, to examine
all Accounts of tho&s;e who had received or i&s;&s;ued out any Monies for this
War; and where They found any Per&s;ons faulty, and who had broken<MILESTONE N="20">
their Tru&s;t, They &s;hould be liable to &s;uch Puni&s;hment as the Parliament
&s;hould think fit:&endq; And a Committee was pre&s;ently named to prepare &s;uch
a Bill accordingly.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bill brought in for in&s;pect|ing publick Accounts.</NOTE> This Propo&s;ition found &s;uch a Concurrence in the Hou&s;e,
that none of the Court thought fit to oppo&s;e it; and others who knew the
Method to be new, and liable to ju&s;t Exceptions, thought it to as little Pur|po&s;e
to endeavour to divert it: And &s;o all Motions for pre&s;ent Supply were
to be laid a&s;ide till a more favourable Conjuncture; and the Overture had
been contrived and put on by many who &s;eemed not to like it, which is
an Artifice not unu&s;ual in Courts or Parliaments.</P>
<P>THE Per&s;ons, who were principally aimed at (for no Doubt They be|lieved<MILESTONE N="30">
that others would be comprehended), were Sir <HI>George Carteret</HI> the
Trea&s;urer of the Navy, through whom all that Expen&s;e had pa&s;&s;ed, who
had many Enemies upon the Opinion that his Office was too great, and
the more by the ill Offices Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> was always ready to do
him; and the Lord <HI>A&s;hley,</HI> who was Trea&s;urer of all the Money that had
been rai&s;ed upon Prizes, which could not but be a great Proportion. The
former was a punctual Officer and a good Accomptant, and had already
pa&s;&s;ed his Account in the Exchequer for two Years, upon which He had
his <HI>Quietus e&s;t;</HI> which was the only lawful Way known and practi&s;ed by
all Accomptants to the Crown, who can receive a good Di&s;charge no<MILESTONE N="40">
other Way: And He was ready to make another Year's Account. But
what Method Commi&s;&s;ioners extraordinary by Act of Parliament would put
it into, He could not imagine, nor be well &s;atisfied with. The other, the
Lord <HI>A&s;hley,</HI> had more Rea&s;on to be troubled, for He was by his Commi&s;|&s;ion
exempted from giving any other Account but to the King him&s;elf,
which Exemption was the only Rea&s;on that made him &s;o &s;olicitous for the
Office; and He well knew that there were great Sums i&s;&s;ued, which could
not be put into any publick Account: So that his Perplexity in &s;everal Re&s;|pects
was not &s;mall. And They Both applied them&s;elves to the King for his
Protection in the Point.<MILESTONE N="50"></P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty was no le&s;s troubled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Upon which the King can|&s;ults the pri|vate Commit|tee.</NOTE> knowing that Both had i&s;&s;ued out many
Sums upon his Warrants, which He would not &s;uffer to be produced; and
called that Committee of the Privy Council with which He u&s;ed to ad|vi&s;e,
<PB N="369" REF="373">
and complained of this unu&s;ual Way of Proceeding in the Hou&s;e of
Commons, which would terrify all Men from &s;erving his Maje&s;ty in any
Receipts; to which Employment Men &s;ubmitted becau&s;e They knew what
They were to do, and what They were to &s;uffer. If They made their Ac|count
according to the known Rules of the Exchequer, their Di&s;charge could
not be denied; and if They failed, They knew what Proce&s;s would be
awarded again&s;t them. But to account by &s;uch Orders as the Parliament
&s;hould pre&s;cribe, and to be liable to &s;uch Puni&s;hment as the Parliament
would inflict, was &s;uch an Uncertainty as would deprive them of all Re&s;t
<MILESTONE N="10">and Quiet of Mind; and was in it&s;elf &s;o unju&s;t, that his Maje&s;ty declared
&startq;that He would never &s;uffer it: That He hoped it would never find a Con|&s;ent
in the Hou&s;e of Commons; if it &s;hould, that the Hou&s;e of Peers would
reject it; but if it &s;hould be brought to him, He was re&s;olved never to
give his Royal A&s;&s;ent.&endq; There was no Man pre&s;ent, who did not &s;eem
fully to concur with his Maje&s;ty that He &s;hould never con&s;ent to it: &startq;How|ever
that the be&s;t Care and Diligence &s;hould be u&s;ed, that it might never
be pre&s;ented to him, but &s;topped in the Hou&s;es; and to that Purpo&s;e that
the Members &s;hould be prepared by giving them Notice of his Plea&s;ure.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Chancellor upon this Argument,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel|lor delivers his Opinion very freely.</NOTE> in which He di&s;cerned no Oppo|&s;ition,
<MILESTONE N="20">enlarged him&s;elf upon what He had often before put his Maje&s;ty in
Mind of; &startq;that He could not be too indulgent in the Defence of the Pri|vileges
of Parliament; that He hoped He would never violate any of them:&endq;
But He de&s;ired him &startq;to be equally &s;olicitous to prevent the Exce&s;&s;es in Par|liament,
and not to &s;uffer them to extend their Juri&s;diction to Ca&s;es They
have Nothing to do with; and that to re&s;train them within their proper
Bounds and Limits is as nece&s;&s;ary, as it is to pre&s;erve them from being in|vaded.
That this was &s;uch a new Encroachment as had no Bottom; and
the Scars were yet too fre&s;h and green of tho&s;e Wounds which had been
inflicted upon the Kingdom from &s;uch U&s;urpation.&endq; And therefore He
<MILESTONE N="30">de&s;ired his Maje&s;ty &startq;to be firm in the Re&s;olution He had taken, and not
to depart from it; and if &s;uch a Bill &s;hould be brought up to the Hou&s;e
of Peers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which is &s;oon reported a|broad to his Prejudice.</NOTE> He would not fail in doing his Duty, and &s;peaking freely his
Opinion again&s;t &s;uch Innovations, how many &s;oever it might offend.&endq; All
which Di&s;cour&s;e of his was in a &s;hort Time after communicated to tho&s;e,
who would not fail to make U&s;e of it to his Di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>THERE was a Corre&s;pondence by this Time begun and warmly pur&s;ued
between &s;ome di&s;contented Members of the Hou&s;e of Peers, who thought
their Parts not enough valued (and the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> was in
the Head of them), and &s;ome Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons, who
<MILESTONE N="40">made them&s;elves remarkable by oppo&s;ing all Things which were pro|po&s;ed
in that Hou&s;e for the King's Service, or which were like to be grate|ful
to him, as Sir <HI>Richard Temple,</HI> Mr. <HI>Seymour,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Garraway,</HI> and
Sir <HI>Robert Howard;</HI> who were all bold Speakers, and meant to make them|&s;elves
con&s;iderable by &s;aying, upon all Occa&s;ions, what wi&s;er Men would
not, whatever They thought.</P>
<P>THE Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> took more Pains than was agreeable to his
Con&s;titution to get an Intere&s;t in all &s;uch Per&s;ons,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Duke of</HI> Buckingham <HI>at the Head of the Oppo&s;ition.</HI></NOTE> invited them to his Ta|ble,
pretended to have a great E&s;teem of their Parts, a&s;ked Coun&s;el of them,
lamented the King's neglecting his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and committing it to other Peo|ple
<MILESTONE N="50">who were not fit for it; and then reported all the Licen&s;e and De|bauchery
of the Court in the mo&s;t lively Colours, being him&s;elf a frequent
Eye and Earwitne&s;s of it. He had a mortal Quarrel with the Lady, and
was at this Time &s;o much in the King's Di&s;plea&s;ure (as He was very fre|quently),
<PB N="370" REF="374">
that He forbore going to the Court, and revenged him&s;elf upon
it by all the merry Tales He could tell of what was done there.</P>
<P>IT cannot be imagined, con&s;idering the loo&s;e Life He led (which was a
Life more by Night than by Day) in all the Liberties that Nature could de|&s;ire
or Wit invent, how great an Intere&s;t He had in Both Hou&s;es of Parlia|ment;
that is, how many in Both would follow his Advice, and concur in
what He propo&s;ed. His Quality and Conde&s;cen&s;ions, the Plea&s;antne&s;s of
his Humour and Conver&s;ation, the Extravagance and Sharpne&s;s of his Wit,
unre&s;trained by any Mode&s;ty or Religion, drew Per&s;ons of all Affections and
Inclinations to like his Company; and to believe that the Levities and the<MILESTONE N="10">
Vanities would be wrought off by Age, and there would enough of Good
be left to become a great Man, and make him u&s;eful to his Country, for
which He pretended to have a wonderful Affection and Reverence; and
that all his Di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t the Court proceeded from their declared Ma|lignity
again&s;t the Liberty of the Subject, and their De&s;ire that the King
&s;hould govern by the Example of <HI>France.</HI> He had always held Intelli|gence
with the principal Per&s;ons of the <HI>Levelling</HI> Party, and profe&s;&s;ed to de|&s;ire
that Liberty of Con&s;cience might be granted to all; and exerci&s;ed his
Wit with mo&s;t Licen&s;e again&s;t the Church, the Law and the Court.</P>
<P>THE King had con&s;tant Intelligence of all his Behaviour, and the Li|berty<MILESTONE N="20">
He took in his Di&s;cour&s;es of him, for which He had Indignation
enough: But of this new Stratagem to make him&s;elf great in Parliament,
and to have a Faction there to di&s;turb his Bu&s;ine&s;s, his Maje&s;ty had no Ap|prehen&s;ion,
believing it impo&s;&s;ible for the Duke to keep his Mind long bent
upon any particular De&s;ign, or to keep and ob&s;erve tho&s;e Hours and Orders
of &s;leeping and eating, as Men who pretend to Bu&s;ine&s;s are obliged to;
and that it was more impo&s;&s;ible, for him to make and pre&s;erve a Friend&s;hip
with any &s;erious Per&s;ons, whom He could never re&s;train him&s;elf from abu&s;ing
and making ridiculous, as &s;oon as He was out of their Company. Yet with
all the&s;e Infirmities and Vices He found a Re&s;pect and Concurrence from<MILESTONE N="30">
Men of different Tempers and Talents, and had an incredible Opinion with
the People.</P>
<P>THE great Object of his Di&s;like,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Hatred to the Duke of</HI> Ormond.</NOTE> Di&s;plea&s;ure and Hatred was the Duke
of <HI>Ormond,</HI> who being his Equal in Title, and Superiour in Credit with the
King, and at lea&s;t equal to him in all other Re&s;pects, He looked upon him
as his Rival; and that his con&s;tant Attendance upon the King through all
his Fortunes, was a Reproach to him for not having performed his Duty
that Way, and gave him a general Reputation in the Kingdom with all
Men who had been faithful to the Crown. The Duke of <HI>Ormond's</HI> younger
Son had married his Niece, who was the Heir apparent of his Hou&s;e; to<MILESTONE N="40">
which though He had given his Con&s;ent when He &s;aw it was not in his
Power to contradict it, yet He pretended that the Duke had made many
Promi&s;es of Friend&s;hip to him which He had not made good; whereas in
Truth the other did really de&s;ire, and had heartily endeavoured, to do him
all the good Offices He could with the King, which &s;ome other new Ex|travagance
of his own di&s;appointed and made uneffectual. Let the Ground
and Rea&s;on be what they will, He did not di&s;&s;emble to hate the Duke of <HI>Or|mond</HI>
heartily, and to be willing to undertake the Pro&s;ecution of any Com|plaint
again&s;t him; of which, in that di&s;tempered and disjointed Condition
of <HI>Ireland,</HI> there could not be Occa&s;ion wanting, as &s;oon as it was known<MILESTONE N="50">
that &s;uch a Patron was ready to undertake their Defence. And it cannot be
denied (the Spirit of Envy is &s;o powerful), that there were too many, who had
no Affection for the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who were yet willing that any
<PB N="371" REF="375">
Thing &s;hould be done to the Prejudice of the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> who They
thought eclip&s;ed the Nobility of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>THERE had been for many Months a great Murmur, rather than Com|plaint,
&startq;of the great Damage the Kingdom in general &s;u&s;tained by the Im|portation
of &s;uch great Quantities of <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Cattle, which were bred there
for Nothing, and tran&s;ported for little, that They might well under&s;ell
all the Cattle here; and from hence the Breed of Cattle in the Kingdom
was totally given over, and thereby the Land would yield no Rent pro|portionably
to what it had ever done: And that this was a principal
<MILESTONE N="10">Cau&s;e of the Want of Money in the Country, which could only be re|medied
by a very &s;trict Act of Parliament, to forbid the Importation of
any Sort of Cattle out of <HI>Ireland</HI> into this Kingdom.&endq; And &s;ome of
them who had mo&s;t thought of the Matter had prepared a Bill,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Bill brought into the Hou&s;e of Commons again&s;t the Importation of</HI> Iri&s;h <HI>Cattle.</HI></NOTE> and brought
it into the Hou&s;e of Commons, where it was read. At fir&s;t it underwent
very calm and rea&s;onable Debates. Very many Members of &s;everal Coun|ties
de&s;ired, &startq;that their Counties might not undergo any Damage for the
Benefit of other individual Places.&endq; They profe&s;&s;ed &startq;that their Coun|ties
had no Land bad enough to breed: But that their great Traffick
con&s;i&s;ted in buying lean Cattle, and making them fat, and upon this
<MILESTONE N="20">They paid their Rent; and if the bringing over <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Cattle &s;hould be
re&s;trained, their Counties mu&s;t be undone.&endq; And this appeared to be the
Ca&s;e of very many Counties in <HI>England.</HI> And the Complaint was of &s;o
new a Nature, that it had never been heard of in <HI>England</HI> till &s;ome few
Months before this Meeting in Parliament; only it had been mentioned in
the Parliament at <HI>Oxford,</HI> as a Grievance to the Northern Counties, which
complained no le&s;s of the <HI>Scots</HI> than of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Cattle; and the Bill that
was at this Time brought into the Hou&s;e of Commons provided as well
again&s;t the one as the other.</P>
<P>WHETHER this Complaint originally proceeded from the Damage which
<MILESTONE N="30">the People of &s;ome Counties &s;u&s;tained, or thought They &s;u&s;tained, which
made their Members in Parliament pre&s;s the Re&s;traint with much Earne&s;t|ne&s;s
(and it cannot be denied that many worthy Men were pa&s;&s;ionate in it,
who were not like to be engaged in particular and factious Conte&s;ts, to comply
with the Humours of other Men), is not ea&s;y to other Men to judge of than
tho&s;e who &s;ate in the Hou&s;es, and ob&s;erved the Manner and the Pa&s;&s;ion in
which tho&s;e Debates were carried. And it cannot be denied but that, how
innocently &s;oever the Grievance fir&s;t came to be mentioned, and to be re|commended
to the Con&s;ideration and Wi&s;dom of the Hou&s;e, the carrying
it on was with unu&s;ual Heat and Pa&s;&s;ion, different from what appeared in
<MILESTONE N="40">the Tran&s;action of any other Bu&s;ine&s;s, that had an A&s;pect only to the Pub|lick:
And it was ob&s;erved, that the Cabal that is mentioned before, be|tween
&s;ome of the Hou&s;e of Peers and of the Hou&s;e of Commons, began
at this Time to meet more frequently, and were united in the driving on
this Affair; which &s;uddenly grew to be in&s;i&s;ted on as of that Importance,
that there could be no Debate begun with Reference to the giving Money
to the King, till this Bill were fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time the Council of <HI>Ireland</HI> had the Alarm of what was in|tended
before the Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Privy Council of</HI> Ireland <HI>re|mon&s;trate a|gain&s;t this Bill.</HI></NOTE> and did not only write to the King him&s;elf,
but a large Letter to the Lords of the Privy Council, in which They repre|&s;ented
<MILESTONE N="50">the pre&s;ent di&s;tracted Condition of that Kingdom, &startq;that there were
more than one hundred thou&s;and Per&s;ons who had Nothing el&s;e to live
upon but their Droves of Cattle; out of which They twice a Year &s;ent
as many as They could &s;pare into <HI>England,</HI> which enabled them to
<PB N="372" REF="376">
pay their Rents, and return &s;uch Goods and Merchandi&s;e from thence as
the Kingdom &s;tood in Need of;&endq; for no Money <HI>in Specie</HI> was returned
upon that Commerce. &startq;That if this Liberty of Trade, which They had
enjoyed in all Ages, &s;hould be taken from them, the King's Army could
not be &s;upported, nor the Government maintained, but the Kingdom mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily be ruined; and probably a new Rebellion, in &s;o general a Di&s;|content
as this Re&s;traint would admini&s;ter, might be again entered into:
And therefore They de&s;ired, that at lea&s;t &s;ome Years might be allowed to
that Traffick which had been always enjoyed; to the End that &s;ome other
Hu&s;bandry might be introduced into the Kingdom, by which the People<MILESTONE N="10">
might live, and which the Government would endeavour to plant with all
po&s;&s;ible Diligence and Encouragement.&endq;</P>
<P>THE King him&s;elf was &s;o much moved with tho&s;e Letters, that He declared,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King a|gain&s;t the Bill.</NOTE>
&startq;that He could neither in Ju&s;tice nor in Con&s;cience con&s;ent to &s;uch a Bill,
which upon Pretence of Benefit to one of his Kingdoms might and mu&s;t be
&s;o mi&s;chievous to the other two&endq; (for <HI>Scotland,</HI> as is &s;aid, was yet compre|hended
as well as <HI>Ireland</HI>): &startq;That He was equally King to all, and obliged
to have an equal Care of all; and never to con&s;ent to any Thing that might
be prejudicial to either of the other, e&s;pecially if the Benefit to the one
were not proportionable to, and as evident as, the Damage was to the<MILESTONE N="20">
other.&endq; And upon the&s;e Grounds He recommended to them, &startq;to give
&s;uch a Stop to this Bill, that it might never be pre&s;ented to him, for if
it were He mu&s;t po&s;itively reject it:&endq; And without Doubt his Maje&s;ty at
that Time did not re&s;olve any Thing more within him&s;elf, than never to
give his Royal A&s;&s;ent to that Bill.</P>
<P>THE Letters from <HI>Ireland</HI> did not make the &s;ame Impre&s;&s;ions upon the
Lords of the Council,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Privy Council di|vided in their Opinions upon it.</NOTE> who were very much divided in their Opinions, even
They who&s;e Zeal for the King's Service was mo&s;t unque&s;tionable. Some
were, upon the &s;ole Con&s;ideration of the Inju&s;tice of it, and the Mi&s;chief
that it would produce in <HI>Ireland,</HI> po&s;itively again&s;t ever con&s;enting to it,<MILESTONE N="30">
and as po&s;itive that it might be &s;topped in the Hou&s;e of Commons, or
thrown out of the Lords Hou&s;e, that it &s;hould never come to the King:
Others did as much believe that it was a real Grievance, in which the Sub|ject
&s;hould have Relief; and in&s;i&s;ted much, &startq;that in a Point evidently for
the Benefit and Advantage of <HI>England, Ireland</HI> ought not to be put into
the Scale, becau&s;e it would be &s;ome Inconvenience there.&endq; Some did in
Truth think that the King was too much inclined to favour the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> and
in that Re&s;pect were well content that this Bill &s;hould be a Mortification to
them: And there wanted not others, who in dark Expre&s;&s;ions (which grew
clearer when the Matter came into the Hou&s;e of Peers) &s;eemed to think,<MILESTONE N="40">
&startq;that the E&s;tates in <HI>Ireland</HI> were more valuable than they were in <HI>Eng|land;</HI>
and that &s;ome Noblemen of that Kingdom lived in a higher Garb,
and made greater Expen&s;es, than the Noblemen in <HI>England</HI> were able
to do; which had not been in former Times.&endq; But They never con|&s;idered,
that tho&s;e Noblemen had Nothing but what de&s;cended to them
from their Ance&s;tors; and that They had faithfully adhered to the King,
and undergone as much Damage for doing &s;o, as any Men had done.</P>
<P>THE Hou&s;e of Commons &s;eemed much more moro&s;e and ob&s;tinate than
it had formerly appeared to be, and &s;olicitous to gra&s;p as much Power and
Authority as any of their Predece&s;&s;ors had done, though no Doubt with no<MILESTONE N="50">
ill Intention: And it may be this would not have &s;o much appeared, if
there had been the &s;ame Vigour in tho&s;e who had u&s;ed to conduct the King's
Bu&s;ine&s;s in that Hou&s;e, as there had u&s;ed to be. But that Spirit was much
<PB N="373" REF="377">
fallen. The chief Men of the Court, upon who&s;e Example other Men
looked, were much more humble than They had u&s;ed to be, and took more
Pains to ingratiate them&s;elves than to advance the Intere&s;t of their Ma&s;ter:
And in&s;tead of pre&s;&s;ing what was de&s;irable upon the Strength of Rea&s;on
and Policy, as They had u&s;ed to do, and by which the major Part of
the Hou&s;e had u&s;ually concurred with them, They now applied them|&s;elves
with Addre&s;s to tho&s;e, who had always frowardly oppo&s;ed what&s;oever
They thought would be grateful to the King; and de&s;ired rather to buy
their Votes and Concurrence by Promi&s;es of Reward and Preferment (which
<MILESTONE N="10">is the mo&s;t di&s;honourable and unthrifty Brokery that can be practi&s;ed in a Par|liament,
which from this Time was much practi&s;ed, and brought many ill
Things to pa&s;s), than to prevail upon tho&s;e weighty and important Argu|ments
which would bear the Light. Which low Artifice rai&s;ed the In&s;olence
of tho&s;e, which would, as ea&s;ily as it had been, have been &s;till overruled
and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; and was quickly di&s;cerned by tho&s;e others, who upon the
Principles of Honour and Wi&s;dom had hitherto &s;wayed the Hou&s;e in all
Matters of publick Concernment, and who now concluded by tho&s;e new
Conde&s;cen&s;ions, that the former &s;ober Spirit and Re&s;olution was laid a&s;ide,
and that peevi&s;h Men would be compounded with; and &s;o re&s;olved to fit
<MILESTONE N="20">&s;till or look on, till the Succe&s;s of this Stratagem might be di&s;cerned.</P>
<P>AND by this Means the Bill for <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Cattle was driven on with more
Fury, and the other concerning Accounts more pa&s;&s;ionately &s;poken of;
whil&s;t every Day not only many of tho&s;e, who had con&s;tantly ob&s;erved the
Advice that had been given them on the Behalf of the King, fell off to the
other Party, but many of his hou&s;hold Servants concurred in the Bill for
<HI>Ireland;</HI> whil&s;t the re&s;t, who did not yet think fit to do &s;o, applied
them&s;elves to the King for his Leave that They might do the &s;ame. And
Sir <HI>William Coventry,</HI> who had now by his In&s;inuations and Communication
made him&s;elf very grateful to the refractory Party, per&s;uaded the King, &startq;that
<MILESTONE N="30">the Hou&s;e had taken the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Bill &s;o much to Heart, that They would
never enter upon the Debate of Money, till that had pa&s;&s;ed the Hou&s;e
and was &s;ent to the Lords, who no Doubt, upon the Knowledge of his
Maje&s;ty's Mind and Re&s;olution, would ea&s;ily throw it out. That if his Ser|vants
continued ob&s;tinate in oppo&s;ing it below, They &s;hould but provoke
and anger the Hou&s;e, and render them&s;elves u&s;ele&s;s to other Parts of his
Maje&s;ty's more important Bu&s;ine&s;s: Whereas if They did now gratify
the Hou&s;e by concurring with them in this Matter, They &s;hould make
them&s;elves acceptable, have Credit enough to divert the Bill of Ac|counts,
and pre&s;ently to di&s;po&s;e every Body to enter upon the Matter of
<MILESTONE N="40">Supply.&endq;</P>
<P>THE King was not plea&s;ed with the Coun&s;el, but had a very good Opi|nion
of the Coun&s;ellor, who He believed could not but judge aright of the
Temper of tho&s;e with whom He had fate and conver&s;ed &s;o long: And &s;o
his Maje&s;ty told him, &startq;He was contented He &s;hould follow the Dictates
of his own Judgment and Con&s;cience;&endq; and the &s;ame An&s;wer He gave
to all &s;uch Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons who came to receive his
Orders.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bill. af|ter great Op|po&s;ition, pa&s;&s;ed by the Com|mons.</NOTE> And after all this, the Bill was carried with great Difficulty, and
long Oppo&s;ition given to it by tho&s;e Members of &s;everal Counties, which
profe&s;&s;ed, &startq;that the bringing over the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Cattle was &s;o much for their Be|nefit,
<MILESTONE N="50">that They could not live well without it,&endq; and were exceedingly
perplexed that it &s;hould pa&s;s; which yet They hoped would be prevented
in the Hou&s;e of Peers: And &s;o the Bill was in great Triumph, and by all
<PB N="374" REF="378">
the Members (as in Ca&s;es They much delight in is u&s;ual), pre&s;ented to the
Hou&s;e of Peers.</P>
<P>AND the Commons no &s;ooner repaired to their own Hou&s;e, than They a&s;|&s;umed
the Debate upon the Accounts, with the &s;ame Fervour They had pur|&s;ued
the other Bill of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and with the &s;ame Declaration, &startq;that They
would not enter upon the Subject of Money, till They &s;aw what Suc|ce&s;s
that Bill would likewi&s;e have;&endq; and appearing every Day more out
of Humour, expre&s;&s;ed le&s;s Reverence towards the Court. And &s;ome Ex|pre&s;&s;ions
were frequently u&s;ed, which &s;eemed to glance at the Licen&s;e and
Di&s;orders and extravagant Expen&s;e of that Place, not without &s;ome Reflec|tions<MILESTONE N="10">
which aimed at the Lady, and at the exorbitant Power exerci&s;ed by
her. And this imperious Way of Proceeding confirmed tho&s;e in their Wa|rine&s;s,
who had no Mind to oppo&s;e or contradict the Party that They would
and meant &s;hould prevail: But They the more endeavoured to render them|&s;elves
gracious to the Leaders, as being willing to admini&s;ter Fewel to the
Fire the others intended to kindle; and, &s;o They might pre&s;erve them&s;elves,
were very willing to expo&s;e other Mini&s;ters to the Jealou&s;y of them, who
They thought would not be quiet without &s;ome Sacrifice. And thus They
alarmed the King with the new Apprehen&s;ions, &startq;that the Hou&s;e, which
had yet dutiful Intentions, if They were cro&s;&s;ed in what They de&s;igned<MILESTONE N="20">
for his Service, might be provoked to be bolder with his Maje&s;ty than They
had been yet, and to mention the Prevalence of the Lady,&endq; which every
Body knew the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> would have been glad to have contri|buted
to. And with the&s;e continued Repre&s;entations, but e&s;pecially with
their old Argument of ca&s;ting it out by the Hou&s;e of Peers, where his Power
could not be doubted, They at la&s;t prevailed with the King to leave all
Men to them&s;elves in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Accounts (where there was a greater
Concurrence),<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bill for in&s;pecting pub|lick Accounts pa&s;&s;ed by the Commons.</NOTE> as He had done in the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Bill: And &s;o that Bill likewi&s;e
was tran&s;mitted to the Lords.</P>
<P>AND at this Time many wi&s;e Men thought, that it would have been<MILESTONE N="30">
very happy for the King if He would have di&s;&s;olved the Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Propriety of di&s;&s;olving the Parlia|ment at this Time.</NOTE> and
pre&s;ently after called another; which would have di&s;covered many Combi|nations,
when the Actors had found them&s;elves excluded from entering
again upon the Stage; and it would have appeared, that all the Storms had
been rai&s;ed by tho&s;e Winds which had their Birth in the King's own Hou&s;e.
And &s;uch a Di&s;&s;olution (to which the King him&s;elf was enough inclined)
would have been very popular throughout the Kingdom, which naturally
doth not love long Parliaments, and exceedingly dete&s;ted this for having only
given away their Money, and rai&s;ed a War of which They &s;aw no End nor
po&s;&s;ible Benefit, without pa&s;&s;ing any good Laws for the Advancement of the<MILESTONE N="40">
Peace and Happine&s;s of the Kingdom. And very few of tho&s;e, who had
gotten Credit in the Hou&s;e to ob&s;truct what the King de&s;ired, were Men of
any Intere&s;t or Reputation with the People.</P>
<P>BUT as Nobody was forward publickly to own and avow this Coun&s;el,
the Con&s;equence whereof They knew if it were not con&s;ented to; &s;o They
who meant to do them&s;elves more Good by the pre&s;ent Indi&s;po&s;ition and Di&s;|temper,
than They could propo&s;e from a new Convention of Men utterly
unknown, and who were like enough to bring Prejudice again&s;t their own
Particulars, u&s;ed all the Means They could devi&s;e to divert the King from
that Inclination. They told him, &startq;that He would never have &s;uch ano|ther<MILESTONE N="50">
Parliament, where He had near one hundred Members of his own
menial Servants and their near Relations, who were all at his Di&s;po&s;al;
by which They had incurred &s;o much Prejudice in the Country, that very
<PB N="375" REF="379">
few of them would ever be elected again. That the pre&s;ent Di&s;temper
was contracted by Accidents and Mi&s;takes, and would yani&s;h upon very
rea&s;onable Conde&s;cen&s;ions, and in another Prorogation: Whereas if it
&s;hould be di&s;&s;olved and new Writs &s;ent out, the People would return none
but <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> and known Enemies to the Church, and &s;uch who were
mo&s;t notoriou&s;ly di&s;affected to the Court.&endq; And this Argument, pre&s;&s;ed
by Men who had no more Affection for the Church than the <HI>Quakers</HI> had,
prevailed with mo&s;t of the Bi&s;hops to di&s;&s;uade the King from hearkening to
any &s;uch Advice; when They had much more Rea&s;on to expect a &s;tronger
<MILESTONE N="10">Party in a new Parliament, and might have ob&s;erved that their Friends fell
from them every Day in Both Hou&s;es, and that the Court was not propi|tious
to them, of which They had afterwards a &s;ad Experience, and which
They might then have well fore&s;een.</P>
<P>THE Hou&s;e of Peers was no &s;ooner po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Bill again&s;t <HI>Iri&s;h</HI>
Cattle,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Great Animo|&s;ities in the Hou&s;e of Lords upon the Bill $gain&s;t</HI> $word$ <HI>Cattle.</HI></NOTE> but it was read, and a marvellous keen Re&s;olution appeared in
many to u&s;e all Expedition in the pa&s;&s;ing it; though if the Matter it&s;elf had
been without Exception, there were &s;o many Clau&s;es and <HI>Provi&s;os</HI> in it &s;o
derogatory to the King's Honour and Prerogative, that many thought it a
high Di&s;re&s;pect to his Maje&s;ty to admit them into Debate. But of the&s;e
<MILESTONE N="20">anon. The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> appeared in the Head of tho&s;e who fa|voured
the Bill, with a marvellous Concernment: And at the Times ap|pointed
for the Debate of it, contrary to his Cu&s;tom of coming into the
Hou&s;e, indeed of not ri&s;ing till eleven of the Clock, and &s;eldom &s;taying
above a Quarter of an Hour, except upon &s;ome Affair which He concerned
him&s;elf in, He was now always pre&s;ent with the fir&s;t in a Morning, and
&s;tayed till the la&s;t at Night; for the Debate often held from the Morning
till four of the Clock in the Afternoon, and &s;ometimes till Candles were
brought in.</P>
<P>AND it grew quickly evident, that there were other Rea&s;ons which cau&s;ed
<MILESTONE N="30">&s;o earne&s;t a Pro&s;ecution of it, above the Encouragement of the Breed of
Cattle in <HI>England:</HI> In&s;omuch as the Lord <HI>A&s;hley,</HI> who next the Duke of
<HI>Buckingham</HI> appeared the mo&s;t violent Supporter of the Bill, could not for|bear
to urge it as an Argument for the pro&s;ecuting it, &startq;that if this Bill did
not pa&s;s, all the Rents in <HI>Ireland</HI> would ri&s;e in a va&s;t Proportion, and tho&s;e
in <HI>England</HI> fall as much; &s;o that in a Year or two the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI>
would have a greater Revenue than the Earl of <HI>Northumberland;</HI>&endq; which
made a vi&s;ible Impre&s;&s;ion in many, as a Thing not to be endured. Whereas
the Duke had indeed at lea&s;t four Times the Proportion of Land in <HI>Ireland</HI>
that de&s;cended to him from his Ance&s;tors, that the Earl had in <HI>England;</HI>
<MILESTONE N="40">and the Revenue of it before the Rebellion was not inferiour to the other's.
But Nothing was more manife&s;t, than that the Warmth of that Pro&s;ecution
in the Hou&s;e of Peers in many Lords did proceed from the Envy They had
of the Duke's Station in one Kingdom, and of his Fortune in the other.</P>
<P>AND the whole Debate upon the Bill was &s;o di&s;orderly and unparliamentary,
that the like had never been known: No Rules or Orders of the Hou&s;e for
the Cour&s;e and Method of Debate were ob&s;erved. And there being, among&s;t
tho&s;e who advanced the Bill, fewer Speakers than there were of tho&s;e who
were again&s;t it, tho&s;e few took upon them to &s;peak oftner than They ought to
do, and to reply to every Man who declared him&s;elf to be of another Opinion:
<MILESTONE N="50">And when They were put in Mind of the Rule of the Hou&s;e, &startq;that no
Man &s;hould &s;peak above once upon the &s;ame Que&s;tion,&endq; They called pre|&s;ently
to have the Hou&s;e re&s;olved into a Committee, which any &s;ingle Mem|ber
may require, and then every Man may &s;peak as often as He plea&s;e;
<PB N="376" REF="380">
and &s;o the Time was &s;pent unprofitably without the Bu&s;ine&s;s being advanced.
In the mean Time the Hou&s;e of Commons proceeded as irregularly, in
&s;ending frequent Me&s;&s;ages to ha&s;ten the Di&s;patch of the Bill, when They
knew well the Debate of every Day: And it was frequently urged as an
Argument, &startq;that the Hou&s;e of Commons was the fitte&s;t Judge of the
Nece&s;&s;ities and Grievances of the People; and They having pa&s;&s;ed this
Bill, the Lords ought to conform to their Opinion.&endq; In Fine, there
grew &s;o great a Licen&s;e of Words in this Debate, and &s;o many per&s;onal Re|flections,
that every Day &s;ome Quarrels aro&s;e, to the great Scandal and Di&s;|honour
of a Court that was the &s;upreme Judicatory of the Kingdom.<MILESTONE N="10"></P>

the Debate, &startq;that whoever was again&s;t that Bill had either an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t

which He him&s;elf re&s;ented &s;o much that He expected Satisfaction, and to

avoid by all the fair Words and Shifts He could u&s;e, but was &s;o far pre&s;&s;ed
by the other, who&s;e Courage was never doubted, that He could not avoid
appointing a Place where They would pre&s;ently meet, which He found the
other would exact to prevent Di&s;covery, and therefore had cho&s;en rather to
urge it him&s;elf than to &s;end a Me&s;&s;age to him. And &s;o He named a known

<P>THE Lord <HI>O&s;&s;ory</HI> made Ha&s;te thither, and expected him much beyond

the Place where He was, and concluding They were &s;ent out to prevent
any Action between them, He avoided &s;peaking with them, but got to the
Place where his Hor&s;e was, and &s;o retired to <HI>London.</HI> The Duke was
found by him&s;elf in another Place on the other Side of the Water, which
was never known by the Name of <HI>Chel&s;ea Fields,</HI> which He &s;aid was the

He was &s;ure He &s;hould quickly hear from him, and upon Conference with<MILESTONE N="40">
his Friends, that the Mi&s;take of the Place would be imputed to him; He
took a &s;trange Re&s;olution, that every Body wondered at, and his Friends di&s;|&s;uaded
him from. And the next Morning, as &s;oon as the Hou&s;e was &s;ate,
the Lord <HI>O&s;&s;ory</HI> being likewi&s;e pre&s;ent that He might find &s;ome Opportu|nity
to &s;peak with him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Duke of</HI> Buckingham <HI>informs the Hou&s;e of the Affair.</HI></NOTE> the Duke told the Hou&s;e, &startq;that He mu&s;t inform
them of Somewhat that concerned him&s;elf; and being &s;ure that it would
come to their Notice &s;ome other Way, He had therefore cho&s;e to acquaint
them with it him&s;elf:&endq; And thereupon related &startq;how the Lord <HI>O&s;&s;ory</HI> had the
Day before found him in the Court, and de&s;ired him to walk into the next
Room, where He charged him with many Particulars which He had &s;poken<MILESTONE N="50">
in that Place, and in few Words told him He &s;hould fight with him;
which though He did not hold him&s;elf obliged to do in Maintenance of any
Thing He had &s;aid or done in the Parliament, yet that it being &s;uitable
<PB N="377" REF="381">
and agreeable to his Nature, to fight with any Man who had a Mind to
fight with him&endq; (upon which He enlarged with a little Vanity, as if
Duelling were his daily Exerci&s;e and Inclination), &startq;He appointed the
Place in <HI>Chel&s;ea Fields,</HI> which He under&s;tood to be the Fields over again&s;t
<HI>Chel&s;ea;</HI> whither, having only gone to his Lodging to change his Sword,
He ha&s;tened, by pre&s;ently cro&s;&s;ing the Water in a Pair of Oars, and &s;tayed
there in Expectation of the Lord <HI>O&s;&s;ory,</HI> until &s;uch Gentlemen,&endq; whom
He named, &startq;found him there, and &s;aid, <HI>They were &s;ent to prevent his and
the Lord</HI> O&s;&s;ory's <HI>Meeting, whom others were likewi&s;e &s;ent to find for
<MILESTONE N="10">the &s;ame Prevention.</HI> Whereupon, concluding that for the pre&s;ent there
would be no Meeting together, He returned with tho&s;e Gentlemen to his
Lodging, being always ready to give any Gentleman Satisfaction that
&s;hould require it of him.&endq;</P>
<P>EVERY Body was exceedingly &s;urpri&s;ed with the Oddne&s;s and Un&s;ea&s;on|ablene&s;s
of the Di&s;cour&s;e, which con&s;i&s;ted, with &s;ome Confu&s;ion, between
aggravating the Pre&s;umption of the Lord <HI>O&s;&s;ory,</HI> and making the Offence
as heinous, as the violating all the Privileges of Parliament could amount
unto; and magnifying his own Courage and Readine&s;s to fight upon any
Opportunity, when it was clear enough that He had declined it by a gro&s;s
<MILESTONE N="20">Shift: And it was wondered at, that He had not cho&s;en rather that &s;ome
other Per&s;on might inform the Hou&s;e of a Quarrel between two Members,
that it might be examined and the Mi&s;chief prevented. But He believed
that Way would not &s;o well repre&s;ent and manife&s;t the Lu&s;tre of his Cou|rage,
and might leave him under an Examination that would not be &s;o ad|vantageous
to him as his own Information: And therefore no Per&s;ua&s;ion
and Importunity of his Friends could prevail with him to decline that
Method.</P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>O&s;&s;ory</HI> &s;eemed out of Countenance, and troubled that the Con|te&s;t
was like to be only in that Place, and cared not to deny any Thing that
<MILESTONE N="30">the Duke had accu&s;ed him of; only &startq;wondered, that He &s;hould &s;ay He
had challenged him for Words &s;poken in the Hou&s;e, when He had ex|pre&s;&s;ly
declared to him, when his Grace in&s;i&s;ted much upon the Privilege
of Parliament to decline giving him any Satisfaction, <HI>that He did not
que&s;tion him for any Words &s;poken in Parliament, but for Words &s;poken in
other Places, and for Affronts, which He had at other Times cho&s;en to bear
rather than to di&s;turb the Company.</HI>&endq; He confe&s;&s;ed, &startq;He had attended
in the very Place where the Duke had done him the Honour to promi&s;e to
meet him;&endq; and mentioned &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions which He had u&s;ed in de|&s;igning
it, which left the Certainty of it not to be doubted.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40">WHEN They had Both &s;aid as much as They had a Mind to, They were
Both required, as is the Cu&s;tom, to withdraw to &s;everal Rooms near the

of the Offence; and that no other Remedy or Examination could be ap|plied
<MILESTONE N="50">to it, even by the King him&s;elf. But if it &s;hould be in any pri|vate

Freedom of Speech: And therefore that there could not be too great a
Puni&s;hment inflicted upon this notorious and mon&s;trous Offence of the
Lord <HI>O&s;&s;ory,</HI> which concerned every Lord in particular, as much as it did
the Duke of <HI>Buckingham;</HI> who had carried him&s;elf as well as the ill Cu&s;|tom
and Iniquity of the Age would admit, and had given no Offence to
the Hou&s;e, towards which He had always paid all po&s;&s;ible Re&s;pect and
Reverence.&endq;</P>

the ill Con&s;equence of &s;uch Violations as the&s;e, which Way &s;oever their<MILESTONE N="10">
Affections were inclined with Reference to their Per&s;ons, were all of Opi|nion,
&startq;that their Offences were &s;o near equal that their Puni&s;hment ought
to be equal: For that be&s;ides the Lord <HI>O&s;&s;ory's</HI> Denial that He had made
any Reflection upon any Words &s;poken in Parliament, which was the Aggra|vation
of his Offence, there was &s;ome Te&s;timony given to the Hou&s;e by
&s;ome Lords pre&s;ent, that the Lord <HI>O&s;&s;ory</HI> had complained of the Duke's Com|portment<MILESTONE N="20">

upon it; &s;o that tho&s;e Words could not be the Ground of the Quarrel.
And it was evident by the Duke's own Confe&s;&s;ion and Declaration, that<MILESTONE N="20">
He was as ready to fight, and went to the Place appointed by him&s;elf for
Encounter; which made the Offence equal.&endq; And therefore They moved,

the Sentence of the Hou&s;e for their Commitment to the <HI>Tower.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>SOME, who would &s;hew their Kindne&s;s to the Duke, were not willing
that He &s;hould undergo the &s;ame Puni&s;hment with the other, until &s;ome
Lords, who were known not to be his Friends, were very earne&s;t &startq;that
the Duke might receive no Puni&s;hment, becau&s;e He had committed no

and had, when no other Tergiver&s;ation would &s;erve his Turn, prudently<MILESTONE N="30">
mi&s;taken the Place that was appointed by him&s;elf;&endq; which was pre&s;&s;ed
by two or three Lords in &s;uch a plea&s;ant Manner, with Reflection upon &s;ome

of &s;uch a Vindication:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They are Both &s;ent to the</HI> Tower.</NOTE> And &s;o They were Both &s;ent to the <HI>Tower.</HI></P>
<P>AND during the Time They remained there, the Bill again&s;t <HI>Ireland</HI> re|mained
in Su&s;pen&s;e, and uncalled for by tho&s;e, who would not hazard their
Cau&s;e in the Ab&s;ence of their &s;tronge&s;t Champion. But the &s;ame Spirit was
kept up in all other Arguments, the Di&s;plea&s;ure, that had ari&s;en again&s;t each

Animo&s;ities ari&s;e, which are not quickly laid a&s;ide, after the Affair it&s;elf
that produced tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions is compo&s;ed and ended. And this Kind of Di&s;|temper
never more appeared, nor ever la&s;ted longer, than from the Debate
and Conte&s;tation upon this Bill.</P>
<P>THOSE two Lords were no &s;ooner at Liberty, and their Di&s;plea&s;ure towards
each other &s;uppre&s;&s;ed or &s;ilenced by the King's Command, but another more
untoward Outrage happened,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Scuffle be|tween the Duke of</HI> Bucking|ham <HI>and the Marquis of</HI> Dorche&s;ter.</NOTE> that continued the &s;ame Di&s;turbance. It hap|pened
that upon the Debate of the &s;ame Affair, the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Bill, there was a<MILESTONE N="50">
Conference appointed with the Hou&s;e of Commons, in which the Duke of
<HI>Buckingham</HI> was a Manager; and as They were &s;itting down in the <HI>Painted
Chamber,</HI> which is &s;eldom done in good Order, it chanced that the Mar|quis
<PB N="379" REF="385">
of <HI>Dorche&s;ter</HI> &s;ate next the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> between whom there
was no good Corre&s;pondence. The one changing his Po&s;ture for his own
Ea&s;e, which made the Station of the other the more unea&s;y, They fir&s;t en|deavoured
by ju&s;tling to recover what They had di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed each other of,
and afterwards fell to direct Blows; in which the Marquis, who was the
lower of the two in Stature, and was le&s;s active in his Limbs, lo&s;t his Peri|wig,
and received &s;ome Rudene&s;s, which Nobody imputed to his Want of
Courage, which was ever le&s;s que&s;tioned than that of the other.</P>
<P>THE Mi&s;demeanor, greater than had ever happened, in that Place and
<MILESTONE N="10">upon &s;uch an Occa&s;ion, in any Age when the lea&s;t Reverence to Govern|ment
was pre&s;erved, could not be concealed; but as &s;oon as the Conference
was ended, was reported to the Hou&s;e, and Both Parties heard, who Both
confe&s;&s;ed enough to make them undergo the Cen&s;ure of the Hou&s;e. The
Duke's Friends would fain have ju&s;tified him, as being provoked by the
other; and it was evident their mutual undervaluing each other always di&s;|po&s;ed
them to affect any Opportunity to manife&s;t it.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>For which They are com|mitted to the</HI> Tower.</NOTE> But the Hou&s;e &s;ent
them Both to the <HI>Tower;</HI> from whence after a few Days They were again
relea&s;ed together, and &s;uch a Reconciliation made as after &s;uch Rencounters
is u&s;ual, where either Party thinks him&s;elf beforehand with the other, as the
<MILESTONE N="20">Marquis had much of the Duke's Hair in his Hands to recompen&s;e for his
pulling off of his Perriwig, which He could not reach high enough to do
to the other.</P>
<P>WHEN all Things were thus far quieted, the Bill was again entered upon
with no le&s;s Pa&s;&s;ion for the Stock that had been wa&s;ted.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Arguments urged again&s;t the</HI> Iri&s;h <HI>Bill in the Hou&s;e of Peers.</HI></NOTE> The Arguments
which were urged again&s;t the Bill for the Inju&s;tice of it were, &startq;that They
&s;hould, without any Cau&s;e or Demerit on their Part, or any vi&s;ible Evi|dence
of a Benefit that would accrue from it to this Kingdom, deprive his
Maje&s;ty's two other Kingdoms of a Privilege they had ever been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of. That They might as rea&s;onably take away the Trade from any one
<MILESTONE N="30">County in <HI>England,</HI> becau&s;e it produced &s;ome Inconvenience to another
County more in their Favour. That the large Counties of <HI>Norfolk, Suf|folk,
Kent,</HI> and other Provinces, would lo&s;e as much by the pa&s;&s;ing of
this Act, as the Northern and any other Counties would gain by it. That
tho&s;e two Kingdoms might with the &s;ame Ju&s;tice pre&s;s his Maje&s;ty's Con|currence,
that They might have no Trade with <HI>England,</HI> which would
bring more Damage to <HI>England</HI> by much, than it would gain by this
Act of Re&s;traint: And that it was again&s;t all the Maxims of Prudence, to
run the Danger of a pre&s;ent Mi&s;chief and Damage, as this would produce
in <HI>Ireland</HI> by the Te&s;timony of the Lord Lieutenant and Council of that
<MILESTONE N="40">Kingdom, only upon the Speculation of a future Benefit that might accrue,
though it were yet only in Speculation.&endq;</P>
<P>THESE, and many other Arguments of this Kind, which for the mo&s;t
Part were offered by Men who had not the lea&s;t Relation to <HI>Ireland,</HI> made
no other Impre&s;&s;ion, than that They were content to leave <HI>Scotland</HI> out of
the Bill; which increa&s;ed their Party again&s;t <HI>Ireland,</HI> and gave little Satis|faction
to the other, who did not &s;o much value the Commerce with the
other Kingdom. And this Alteration the Hou&s;e of Commons likewi&s;e con|&s;ented
to, but with great Oppo&s;ition, &s;ince in Truth that Conce&s;&s;ion de|&s;troyed
the Foundation upon which the whole Fabrick of the Bill was
<MILESTONE N="50">&s;upported.</P>
<P>THEN the Debate fell upon &s;ome derogatory Clau&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Again&s;t Clau&s;es in it derogatory to the Preroga|tive.</NOTE> and <HI>Provi&s;os</HI> very
contrary to his Maje&s;ty's ju&s;t Prerogative and Power (for They made his
Maje&s;ty's own Licen&s;e and Warrant of no Effect or Authority, but liable
<PB N="380" REF="386">
to be controlled by a Con&s;table; nor would permit the Importation of three
thou&s;and Beeves, which, by an Act of Parliament in <HI>Ireland,</HI> were every
Year to be delivered at <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> and another Port for the Provi&s;ion of the
King's Hou&s;e); which in many Re&s;pects the Hou&s;e generally di&s;liked, and
de&s;ired &startq;that it might have no other Style than had been accu&s;tomed in all
the penal Acts of Parliament which were in Force, it being to be pre|&s;umed,
that the King would never di&s;pen&s;e with any Violation of it, ex|cept
in &s;uch Ca&s;es as the Benefit and Good of the Kingdom required it;
which might naturally fall out, if there &s;hould happen &s;uch a Murrain
among&s;t the Bea&s;ts of that Species, as had been the&s;e late Years among&s;t<MILESTONE N="10">
Hor&s;es, which had de&s;troyed &s;o many thou&s;and, that good Hor&s;es were
now hard to be procured. And if the &s;ame or the like De&s;truction &s;hould
fall upon the other Cattle, We &s;hould have then more Cau&s;e to complain
of the Scarcity and the Dearne&s;s of Meat, than We have now of the Plenty
and Cheapne&s;s, which was the only Grievance now felt, and which King|doms
&s;eldom complained of: And in &s;uch a Ca&s;e it would be very great
Pity, that the King &s;hould not have Power enough to provide for the
Supply of his Subjects, and to prevent a common Dearth.&endq;</P>
<P>BUT this was again oppo&s;ed with as much Pa&s;&s;ion and Violence as had
fallen out in any Part of the Debate; and &s;uch rude Arguments u&s;ed again&s;t<MILESTONE N="20">
&s;uch a Power in the King, as if the Que&s;tion were upon repo&s;ing &s;ome new
Tru&s;t in him, whereas it was upon dive&s;ting him of a Tru&s;t that was inhe|rent
in him from all Antiquity: And &startq;that it was the &s;ame Thing to be
without the Bill, and not to provide again&s;t the King's di&s;pen&s;ing with
the not obeying it, who&s;e Inclinations were well known in this Particu|lar;
and therefore the Effect of them, and of the Importunity of the
Courtiers, mu&s;t be provided again&s;t.&endq; And throughout this Di&s;cour&s;e
there was &s;uch a Liberty of Language made U&s;e of, as reflected more upon
the King's Honour, and indeed upon his whole Council and Court, than had
been heard in that Hou&s;e, but in a Time of Rebellion, without very &s;e|vere<MILESTONE N="30">
Reprehen&s;ion: And it &s;o much offended the Hou&s;e now, that, not|with&s;tanding
all the &s;turdy Oppo&s;ition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The&s;e Clau&s;es are amended by the Lords.</NOTE> it was re&s;olved that tho&s;e Clau&s;es and
<HI>Provi&s;os</HI> &s;hould be amended in &s;ome Places, and totally left out in others.
And with the Alteration and Amendments it was &s;ent down to the Hou&s;e
of Commons.</P>
<P>AT this Time the publick Affairs and Nece&s;&s;ities were little looked after
or con&s;idered. The Fleet was come into the Ports, but there was no Mo|ney
to pay off the Men: And what was equally mi&s;chievous, there was no
Way to make the Provi&s;ions for the next Spring, that the Fleet might be
ready for the Sea by the Time the Enemy would a&s;&s;uredly be out. If the<MILESTONE N="40">
Victualler were not &s;upplied, who had much Money due to him, the Sea|&s;on
would be pa&s;t in which He was to buy the Cattle that He mu&s;t kill;
and He complained how much He &s;hould &s;uffer by this Bill of <HI>Ireland,</HI>
which already rai&s;ed the Price of all Meats. And the Yards wanted all
tho&s;e Tacklings and Rigging and Ma&s;ts, without which another Fleet could
not be &s;ent out, and which could no otherwi&s;e be provided than by ready
Money. The King had anticipated all his own Revenue, and was ready
to expo&s;e that for farther Security, but Nobody would tru&s;t. The new
<HI>Provi&s;os</HI> in the Bill of Supply at <HI>Oxford</HI> gave no new Credit, but were
found as mi&s;chievous as any Body had apprehended they would be: And<MILESTONE N="50">
the Bankers, who in all &s;uch Occa&s;ions were a &s;ure Refuge, wanted now
Credit them&s;elves; which that They might not recover, the Parliament
had treated them as ill &s;ince They came together, that is, with Reproaches
<PB N="381" REF="387">
and Threats, as They had done at <HI>Oxford.</HI> In which Kind of Per&s;ecution
Sir <HI>William Coventry,</HI> and &s;ome who followed him, led the Van, very much
to the King's Prejudice and again&s;t his Command; but They excu&s;ed them|&s;elves,
upon the Credit it gave them in the Hou&s;e to do him Service.</P>
<P>ALL this was well enough under&s;tood: And it was as vi&s;ible, that They
intended to make it a forcible Argument for the pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Bill,
which, though from different Motives, was now become the Sacrifice with|out
which They would not be appea&s;ed; and therefore, when the Bill was
&s;ent to them with tho&s;e Alterations and Amendments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Commons adhere to their Bill.</NOTE> They rejected them
<MILESTONE N="10">all, and voted, &startq;that They would adhere to their own Bill without de|parting
from a Word of it, except with Reference to <HI>Scotland,</HI>&endq; from
which They had receded. And if upon this very unu&s;ual Return the Hou&s;e
of Peers had likewi&s;e voted, &startq;that They too would adhere,&endq; which They
might regularly have done, and would have been con&s;ented to by the
major Part of the Hou&s;e if the Que&s;tion had been then put; there had
been an End of that Bill. But that mu&s;t not be &s;uffered: The Party that
cheri&s;hed it was too much concerned to let it expire in a deep Silence,
and were numerous enough to ob&s;truct and defer what They liked not,
though not to e&s;tabli&s;h what They de&s;ired. Some of them, that is, &s;ome
<MILESTONE N="20">who de&s;ired that the Bill &s;hould pa&s;s, though uncorrupted by their Pa&s;&s;ions,
did not like the Ob&s;tinacy of the Hou&s;e of Commons in not departing from
&s;ome unu&s;ual Clau&s;es and Pretences; yet were not willing to have the like
Vote for adhering to pa&s;s in that Hou&s;e, which it might do when all other
Remedies &s;hould fail; and therefore moved, &startq;that a Conference might be
required, in which &s;uch Rea&s;ons might be given as might &s;atisfy them.&endq;
Many Conferences, and free Conferences, were held, in which the Com|mons
&s;till maintained their Adherence with a wonderful Petulance: And
tho&s;e Members, who were appointed to manage the Conferences, took the
Liberty to u&s;e all tho&s;e Arguments, and the very Expre&s;&s;ions, which had
<MILESTONE N="30">been u&s;ed in the Hou&s;e of Peers, again&s;t leaving any Power in the King to
di&s;pen&s;e; and added &s;uch other of their own as more reflected on his Ma|je&s;ty's
Honour; and yet concluded as if They could &s;ay more if They were
provoked, upon which every Man might make what Glo&s;&s;es He plea&s;ed, and
the King him&s;elf was left to his own Imaginations.</P>
<P>THERE need be no other In&s;tance given of the unheard of and incre|dible
Pa&s;&s;ion that was &s;hewed in the Tran&s;action of that Bill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An In&s;tance of the Pa&s;&s;ion of the Commons $word$ this Affair.</NOTE> than a Parti|cular
that related to the City of <HI>London.</HI> Upon the News of the great Fire
in <HI>London,</HI> and the Deva&s;tation that it made there, there was &s;o general a
Lamentation in <HI>Ireland</HI> as might be expected from a neighbour Province,
<MILESTONE N="40">that had &s;o great a Commerce with and Dependance upon it. And the
Con&s;ent in this Lamentation was &s;o dige&s;ted, that the &s;everal Provinces had
made a Computation and Divi&s;ion between them&s;elves, and pre&s;ented a De|claration
to the Lord Lieutenant and Council, &startq;that They had &s;o tender a
Sen&s;e of that Calamity, that if They were able to rai&s;e Money to admi|ni&s;ter
&s;ome A&s;&s;i&s;tance to the City towards the Reparation of their great
Lo&s;s, They would willingly offer and pre&s;ent it: But that not being in
their Power or Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the great Scarcity and Want of Money through|out
that Kingdom being notoriou&s;ly known, but there being Somewhat in
their Power to offer, which might at lea&s;t te&s;tify their Good-Will, and not
<MILESTONE N="50">be wholly u&s;ele&s;s towards the End They de&s;igned it; They had agreed be|tween
them&s;elves to give unto the Lord Mayor and City of <HI>London,</HI> to be
di&s;po&s;ed of by them to &s;uch particular U&s;es as They &s;hould judge mo&s;t
convenient, the Number of thirty thou&s;and <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Bea&s;ts, which &s;hould be

delivered within &s;uch a Time and at &s;uch Ports,&endq; which were named, &startq;to
any &s;uch Per&s;ons as &s;hould be appointed to receive them.&endq; And of this
They de&s;ired the Lord Lieutenant and Council to adverti&s;e the King, and
likewi&s;e give Notice to the City of <HI>London:</HI> Both which were done ac|cordingly;
and the Adverti&s;ement arrived in the City in the Time when
this Bill was depending in the Lords Hou&s;e. Whereupon the Lord Mayor
and Aldermen pre&s;ented a Petition to the Lords, with a <HI>Provi&s;o</HI> that They
de&s;ired might be in&s;erted in the Bill that was before them, by which it was
provided, &startq;that Nothing contained in that Bill &s;hould hinder the City of
<HI>London</HI> from enjoying the charitable Donative of the thirty thou&s;and<MILESTONE N="10">
Cattle, but that They might have Liberty to import the &s;ame.&endq;</P>
<P>IT can hardly be believed with what Pa&s;&s;ion and Indignation this Petition
was received by the Hou&s;e, what Invectives were made again&s;t the City,
&startq;for their Pre&s;umption in interpo&s;ing their own particular Intere&s;t to ob|&s;truct
the publick Affairs of the Kingdom;&endq; and then the Reflections
which were made upon the Council of <HI>Ireland,</HI> &startq;for giving Countenance
to &s;uch an Addre&s;s, and becoming In&s;truments them&s;elves to promote and
advance it:&endq; Which They would not allow &startq;to be an Offering of Cha|rity,
but a Cheat and a Cozenage by Combination to elude an Act of Par|liament,
which They could not choo&s;e but hear of, and could not but<MILESTONE N="20">
believe that it was pa&s;&s;ed by this Time. Which if it had been, and that
Power left in the King as had been propo&s;ed, They might now &s;ee how
it would have been applied: For They could not doubt, but there would
enough have advi&s;ed the King, that He &s;hould gratify the City of <HI>London</HI>
with a Licen&s;e for this Importation; which could not or would not have
been &s;o warily drawn, but that, under the Licen&s;e for thirty thou&s;and,
there would be three hundred thou&s;and imported into <HI>England;</HI> and this
the great Charity aimed at and was a&s;&s;ured of.&endq; And &s;o, after much
Bitterne&s;s, They de&s;ired &startq;that the Petition and the <HI>Provi&s;o</HI> might be Both
rejected.&endq;<MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>BUT this Pa&s;&s;ion did not cover the whole Hou&s;e, which neither com|mended
nor approved it, and were much le&s;s tran&s;ported with it. They
believed it was a very &s;ea&s;onable Intention of Charity, and would not
take upon them to fru&s;trate it; and &s;o prevailed, that it was pa&s;&s;ed in that
Hou&s;e, and tran&s;mitted with Approbation to the other. But it had the
&s;ame Fate there with the other <HI>Provi&s;os,</HI> and was thrown out with that Bit|terne&s;s
and Ob&s;ervation which had been offered again&s;t it by &s;ome Lords.
Nor could any Expedients alter or remove their Ob&s;tinacy, though many
were offered upon Conferences, and particularly &startq;that all the Bea&s;ts &s;hould
be killed in <HI>Ireland</HI> and powdered there, and then &s;ent over in Barrels or<MILESTONE N="40">
other Ca&s;ks;&endq; but They found Cozenage in that too, and were as angry
with the Cattle when they were dead, as when they were alive, as if it
would for a Time keep down the Price of Meat in <HI>England,</HI> which They
de&s;ired to advance: So that there was Nothing gotten in all tho&s;e Conferences,
but the Di&s;covery of new Jealou&s;ies of the King and the Court, and new
In&s;inuations of the Di&s;contents and Murmurs in the Country, that this Bill
was &s;o long ob&s;tructed. Which being &s;till repre&s;ented to the King with the
mo&s;t gha&s;tly A&s;pects towards what Effects it might produce, his Maje&s;ty in
the End was prevailed upon, notwith&s;tanding very earne&s;t Advice to the
Contrary, not only to be willing to give his Royal A&s;&s;ent when it &s;hould be<MILESTONE N="50">
offered to him, but to take very great Pains to remove tho&s;e Ob&s;tructions
which hindered it from being offered to him, and to &s;olicit particularly very
many Lords to depart from their own Sen&s;e, and to conform to what He
<PB N="383" REF="389">
thought convenient to his Service; which gave tho&s;e who loved him not
great Argument of Triumph, and to tho&s;e who loved him very pa&s;&s;ionately
much Matter of Mortification. Yet after all this, and when his Maje&s;ty
had changed &s;ome Mens Re&s;olutions, and prevailed with others to withdraw
and to be ab&s;ent when the Bill &s;hould come again to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bill at length con&s;ent|ed to by the Hou&s;e of Lords.</NOTE> it was
carried with great Difficulty and with great Oppo&s;ition, and again&s;t the Pro|te&s;tation
of many of the Lords.</P>
<P>IN all the Debate upon this Bill, and upon the other of Accounts, the
Chancellor had the Misfortune to lo&s;e much Credit in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons,
<MILESTONE N="10">not only by a very &s;trong and cordial Oppo&s;ition to what They de|&s;ired,
but by taking all Occa&s;ions, which were offered by the frequent Ar|guments
which were urged &startq;of the Opinion and the Authority of the Hou&s;e
of Commons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel|lor offends the Commons by de&s;iring the Peers to re|&s;train their Encroach|ments.</NOTE> and that it was fit and nece&s;&s;ary to concur with them,&endq;
to mention them with le&s;s Reverence than They expected. It is very
true: He had always u&s;ed in &s;uch Provocations to de&s;ire the Lords, &startq;to
be more &s;olicitous in pre&s;erving their own unque&s;tionable Rights and
mo&s;t important Privileges, and le&s;s tender in re&s;training the Exce&s;s and
new Encroachments of the Hou&s;e of Commons, which extended their
Juri&s;diction beyond their Limits.&endq; He put them often in Mind &startq;of the
<MILESTONE N="20">Mi&s;chiefs which had their Original from the Liberties the Hou&s;e of Com|mons
a&s;&s;umed, and the Compliance the Hou&s;e of Peers had de&s;cended to,
in the late ill Times, and which produced the Rebellion; and were
carried &s;o far, till, after all the multiplied Affronts, They had wre&s;ted
the whole Authority out of the Hands of the Hou&s;e of Peers, and at
la&s;t declared them u&s;ele&s;s Members of the Commonwealth, and &s;hut
up the Door of their Hou&s;e with a Padlock, which They had never
Power to unfa&s;ten till the King's Return.&endq; And in tho&s;e Occa&s;ions his
Expre&s;&s;ions were many Times &s;o lively, that they offended many of the
Lords who were pre&s;ent, and had too much contributed to tho&s;e Extrava|gancies,
<MILESTONE N="30">as much as it could do any of the Commons.</P>
<P>THE Truth is; He did never di&s;&s;emble from the Time of his Return
with the King, whom He had likewi&s;e prepared and di&s;po&s;ed to the &s;ame
Sentiments whil&s;t his Maje&s;ty was abroad, that his Opinion was, &startq;that the
late Rebellion could never be extirpated and pulled up by the Roots, till
the King's regal and inherent Power and Prerogative &s;hould be fully
avowed and vindicated; and till the U&s;urpations in Both Hou&s;es of Parlia|ment
&s;ince the Year 1640 were di&s;claimed and made odious; and many
other Exce&s;&s;es, which had been affected by Both before that Time under
the Name of Privileges, &s;hould be re&s;trained or explained:&endq; For all which
<MILESTONE N="40">Reformation the Kingdom in general was very well di&s;po&s;ed, when it
plea&s;ed God to re&s;tore the King to it. Nor did the Convention, which pro|claimed
the King and invited him to return, exerci&s;e after his Return any
exorbitant Power, but what was of Nece&s;&s;ity upon former Irregularities, and
contributed to the pre&s;ent Ends and De&s;ires of the King.</P>
<P>AND this Parliament, that was upon the Di&s;&s;olution of the former quickly
&s;ummoned by the King's Writ, willingly inclined to that Method, as ap|pears
by tho&s;e many excellent Acts which vindicated the King's Sovereign
Power over Parliaments, and declared the Nullity of all Acts done by one
or Both Hou&s;es without the King's A&s;&s;ent; declared and &s;ettled the ab&s;olute
<MILESTONE N="50">Power of the Crown over the Militia; repealed that Act of Parliament that
had excluded the Bi&s;hops from being Members of the Hou&s;e of Peers, and
re&s;tored them to their Se&s;&s;ion there; and repealed that other infamous Act
for Triennial Parliaments, which had Clau&s;es in it to have led the People
<PB N="384" REF="390">
into Rebellion; and would willingly have pro&s;ecuted the &s;ame Method, if
They had had the &s;ame Advice and Encouragement.</P>
<P>BUT They had continued to &s;it too long together, and were invited
to meddle and interpo&s;e in Matters out of their own Sphere, to give their
Advice with Reference to Peace and War, to hold Conferences with the
King, and to offer their Advices to him, and to receive Orders from him&s;elf;
and his Maje&s;ty was per&s;uaded by very un&s;kilful Men, &startq;that They were
&s;o ab&s;olutely at his Di&s;po&s;al, that He need never doubt their undertaking
any Thing that would be ingrateful to him, and that whil&s;t He pre&s;erved
that entire Intere&s;t He had in the lower Hou&s;e (which He might ea&s;ily do)<MILESTONE N="10">
He need not care what the other Hou&s;e did or had a Mind to do;&endq; and
&s;o induced his Maje&s;ty to undervalue his Hou&s;e of Peers as of little Power to
do him Good or Harm, and prevailed with him too far to countenance
that fal&s;e Doctrine; towards which the Hou&s;e of Peers them&s;elves contri|buted
too much, by not inquiring into or con&s;idering the publick State of
the Kingdom, or providing Remedies for growing Evils, or indeed meddling
with any Thing in the Government till They were invited to it by &s;ome
Me&s;&s;age or Overture from the Hou&s;e of Commons: In&s;omuch as They &s;ate
not early in the Morning, according to the former Cu&s;tom of Parliaments,
but came not together till ten of the Clock; and very often adjourned as<MILESTONE N="20">
&s;oon as They met, becau&s;e that Nothing was brought from the Hou&s;e of
Commons that admini&s;tered Cau&s;e of Con&s;ultation; and upon that Ground
often adjourned for one or two Days together, whil&s;t the other Hou&s;e &s;ate,
and drew the Eyes of the Kingdom upon them, as the only vigilant People
for their Good.</P>
<P>THEN when any Thing fell in their Way, that They could draw a Con|&s;equence
from that might relate to their Privileges, They were &s;o jealous of
an Inva&s;ion, that They neither con&s;idered former Precedents, nor Rules of
Honour or Ju&s;tice; and were not only &s;olicitous for that Freedom which
belonged to them&s;elves and their menial Servants, who ought not to be di&s;|quieted<MILESTONE N="30">
by private Suits and Pro&s;ecutions in Law, whil&s;t They are obliged
to attend upon the Service of their Country in Parliament, but gave their
Protections <HI>ad Libitum,</HI> which were commonly &s;old by their Servants to
bankrupt Citizens, and to &s;uch who were able but refu&s;ed to pay their
ju&s;t Debts. And when their Creditors knew that They could have no
Relation of Attendance to any Man, and thereupon cau&s;ed them to be ar|re&s;ted,
They produced &s;ome Protection granted to them by &s;ome Lord;
whereupon They were not only di&s;charged, but their Creditors, and all
who bore any Part in the Pro&s;ecution, were puni&s;hed with great Rigour,
and to their great Lo&s;s and Damage, and to the great Prejudice of the City,<MILESTONE N="40">
and Interruption of the whole Cour&s;e of the Ju&s;tice of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>WHEN the Hou&s;e of Commons &s;ent up a Bill for the Suppre&s;&s;ion or Re|formation
of many Irregularities and Mi&s;demeanors, which had grown up
in the late Times of Di&s;order and Confu&s;ion, as Conventicles and other
riotous A&s;&s;emblies, wherein there was a Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome Clau&s;es of Power
to in&s;eriour Officers, whereby They were qualified to di&s;cover tho&s;e Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions
which would otherwi&s;e be concealed; the Lords would be &s;ure al|ways
to in&s;ert &s;ome <HI>Provi&s;o</HI> to &s;ave their Privileges, even in Acts which pro|vided
for the Puni&s;hment of &s;uch Crimes as no Per&s;on of Quality could be
&s;uppo&s;ed to be guilty of, as &s;tealing of Wood, and &s;uch vile Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es:<MILESTONE N="50">
Which took up much Time in Debate, and incen&s;ed the Hou&s;e of Com|mons,
and produced many froward Debates, in which the King thought
the Peers in the Wrong.</P>
<P><PB N="385" REF="391">
THIS Kind of Temper or Di&s;temper upon very trivial and light Occa&s;ions,
in Sea&s;ons which required Gravity and Di&s;patch, provoked the Hou&s;e of Com|mons
to take more upon them, to enter upon Conte&s;ts &s;ometimes unrea&s;on|ably
with the Lords, and to a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves an Authority in Matters in
which They ought not to interpo&s;e; and then were encouraged and in|deed
induced by tho&s;e who had near Relation to the King and were tru&s;ted
in his Service, to affect Novelties both in the Form and Sub&s;tance of their
Proceedings, which tho&s;e Per&s;ons concurred in, much out of Ignorance what
was to be done, and more out of Affectation to compa&s;s &s;ome crooked
<MILESTONE N="10">End of their own, to the Prejudice of another Per&s;on who was in their Di&s;|favour.
And when the&s;e Sallies out of the old trodden Path were taken No|tice
of, and his Maje&s;ty had been advi&s;ed to prevent them in Time, He was
per&s;uaded, either &startq;that the Exceptions were in Matters of little Moment,
and made only by formal Men who liked Nothing that was out of the old
common Road; or that the Liberty would be applied to his Service, and in
many u&s;eful Occa&s;ions would mollify or &s;ubdue the inconvenient Moro&s;ity
of the Lords; or, when it &s;hould exceed, it would be &s;till in his Maje&s;ty's
Power to re&s;train it, when He found it nece&s;&s;ary.&endq; And the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es
prevailed too much with his Maje&s;ty, till He now found the Humour was
<MILESTONE N="20">grown too &s;turdy for him to contend with; and the &s;ame Men, who had
per&s;uaded him to contemn it, were now more importunate with him that
He would comply with it.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor had always as earne&s;tly oppo&s;ed the over-captious in|&s;i&s;ting
upon Privilege in the Lords Hou&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He offends the Lords by ad|vi&s;ing them not to in&s;i&s;t unrea&s;onably upon Privi|lege.</NOTE> either when in Truth there was
not a ju&s;t Ground for it, or when They would extend it farther than it
would regularly reach; and oftentimes put them in Mind &startq;of many exor|bitant
Acts which &s;tood &s;till mentioned in their Journal-Books, of their
Proceedings in the late rebellious Times, which might be looked upon as
Precedents by Po&s;terity, and in which the Hou&s;e of Commons had really
<MILESTONE N="30">invaded their greate&s;t Privileges, and trampled upon their highe&s;t Juri&s;|diction;
which was worthy of their mo&s;t &s;trict Proceedings to vindicate
by Prote&s;tation, and by expunging the Memorial thereof out of all their
Books and Records, that there might be no Foot&s;teps left to mi&s;lead the
&s;ucceeding Ages;&endq; and often de&s;ired them &startq;to pre&s;erve a Power in them|&s;elves
to put the Hou&s;e of Commons in Mind of their exceeding their
Limits, for which They often gave them Occa&s;ion, and particularly as
often as They &s;ent to quicken them in any Debate, which was a very
modern Pre&s;umption, and derogatory from that Re&s;pect which a Hou&s;e of
Commons had always paid to the Hou&s;e of Lords. And this They could
<MILESTONE N="40">not rea&s;onably or effectually do, till They declined all unju&s;t or unne|ce&s;&s;ary
Pretences to Privileges which were not their Due, and e&s;pecially
to a Power of calling private Ca&s;es of Right and Ju&s;tice, which ought to
be determined by the Law and in Courts of Ju&s;tice, to be heard and ad|judged
before them&s;elves in Parliament; of which there were too frequent
Occa&s;ions to oppo&s;e and contradict their Juri&s;diction.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS free Way of Di&s;cour&s;e offended many of the Lords, who thought
him not jealous enough of nor zealous for the Privilege of the Peerage: And
They were now very glad that He u&s;ed &s;o much more Freedom again&s;t the
Proceedings of the Hou&s;e of Commons, which They were &s;ure would be re|&s;ented
<MILESTONE N="50">below, more than it had been above. And many of his Friends in|formed
him &startq;how ill it was taken; and how carefully all that He &s;aid, and
much that He did not &s;ay, was tran&s;mitted by &s;ome of the Lords to them,
who would not &s;ail in &s;ome Sea&s;on to remember and apply it to his highe&s;t
<PB N="386" REF="392">
Di&s;advantage;&endq; and therefore de&s;ired him &startq;to u&s;e le&s;s Fervour in tho&s;e
Argumentations.&endq; But He was in that, as in many Things of that Kind
that related to the offending other Men, for his own Sake uncoun&s;ellable:
Not that He did not know that it expo&s;ed him to the Cen&s;ure of &s;ome Men
who lay in Wait to do him Hurt, but becau&s;e He neglected tho&s;e Cen&s;ures,
nor valued the Per&s;ons who promoted them; being confident that He would
be liable to no Charge that He &s;hould be a&s;hamed of, and well knowing
that He had, and being well known to have, a higher E&s;teem of Parliament,
and a greater De&s;ire to pre&s;erve the ju&s;t Privileges of Both Hou&s;es, than They
had who &s;eemed to be angry with him on that Behalf; and that the extend|ing<MILESTONE N="10">
them beyond their due Length would in the End endanger the De&s;truc|tion
of Parliaments.</P>
<P>BUT He &s;hortly after found, that this Guard was not &s;ecure enough to
defend him. What He &s;aid in Parliament was the Sen&s;e of more who would
not &s;peak it, than there were of tho&s;e who di&s;liked it; and how much &s;o|ever
it offended them, They could not out of it find a Crime to accu&s;e him
of. But They who were more concerned to remove him from a Po&s;t,
where He too narrowly watched and too often ob&s;tructed the Liberties They
took, re&s;olved to &s;acrifice all their Oaths and Obligations, which obliged
them to the Contrary, to the Satisfaction of their Envy and their Malice:<MILESTONE N="20">
And &s;o what&s;oever He &s;aid or advi&s;ed in the mo&s;t &s;ecret Council to the King
him&s;elf with Reference to Things or Per&s;ons, They communicated all to
tho&s;e who had mo&s;t Rea&s;on to be angry, yet could not own the Informa|tion.
Of all which He had Adverti&s;ement, and that a Storm would be
&s;hortly rai&s;ed to &s;hake him, of which He had little Apprehen&s;ion; never
&s;u&s;pecting that it would ari&s;e out of that Quarter, from whence He &s;oon
after di&s;cerned it to proceed.</P>
<P>THERE was another particular and private Accident that fell out at this
Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lord</HI> Roos <HI>moves for a Bill to &s;et a&s;ide the I&s;&s;ue of his Lady.</HI></NOTE> that admini&s;tered more Occa&s;ion of Faction and Di&s;&s;ention in the
Hou&s;es, which always ob&s;tructed and perplexed all publick Bu&s;ine&s;s. The<MILESTONE N="30">
Marquis of <HI>Dorche&s;ter</HI> had &s;ome Years before married one of his Daughters
to the Lord <HI>Roos,</HI> elde&s;t Son to the Earl of <HI>Rutland;</HI> Both Families very
noble in them&s;elves, and of great Fortunes, and allied to all the great Fa|milies
of the Kingdom. The Lady being of a Humour not very agreeable,
and not finding the Satisfaction She expected where She ought to have re|ceived
it, looked for it abroad where She ought not to find it. And her
Hu&s;band, as Men con&s;cious to them&s;elves of any notable Defect u&s;e to be,
was indulgent enough, not &s;trictly inquiring how She behaved her&s;elf, and
She as little di&s;&s;embling or concealing the Contempt She had of her Hu&s;band;
until his Friends, e&s;pecially the Mother (who was a Lady of a very great Spirit<MILESTONE N="40">
and mo&s;t exalted Pa&s;&s;ion), took Notice of her frequent Ab&s;ence from her Hu&s;|band,
and of her little Kindne&s;s towards him when She was pre&s;ent with him.
And the young Lady, who with her other Defects had Want of Wit to bear
a Reprehen&s;ion She de&s;erved, in&s;tead of excu&s;ing, avowed her no E&s;teem of
her Hu&s;band; charged him with Debauchery, and being always in Drink,
which was too true; and reproached him with Folly, as a Man not worthy
to be beloved. And the Pa&s;&s;ion &s;welling to a great Height on Both Sides, the
Marquis came to be engaged on the Behalf of his Daughter, and challenged
her Hu&s;band to fight with him, who in many Re&s;pects was not capable, nor
did under&s;tand tho&s;e Encounters.<MILESTONE N="50"></P>
<P>IN the End, after many Acts of Pa&s;&s;ion, which admini&s;tered too much
Cau&s;e of Mirth and Scandal to the World, yet by the Advice and Mediation
of Friends, as good a Reconciliation as in &s;uch Ca&s;es is u&s;ual was made, and
<PB N="387" REF="393">
the young Couple brought to live again together. And the Lady having the
A&s;cendant over the Lord, who was very de&s;irous to live quietly upon any
Conditions, that He might enjoy him&s;elf though He could not enjoy her, He
was contented that She made a Journey to <HI>London</HI> upon Pretence to &s;ee &s;ome
Friends: And the Time being expired which She had pre&s;cribed for her Ab|&s;ence,
He &s;ent to her to return, which She deferred from Time to Time. But
at la&s;t after many Months She returned to him in &s;o gro&s;s a Manner, that it ap|peared
that She had kept Company too much, which She never endeavoured
to conceal; and when her Hu&s;band told her &startq;that She was with Child,&endq;
<MILESTONE N="10">and a&s;ked &startq;who got it;&endq; She an&s;wered him confidently, &startq;that whoever
got it, if it proved a Boy, as She believed it would, He &s;hould be Earl of
<HI>Rutland.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>THIS was more than the young Man could bear without informing his
Mother (the good Earl not loving to engage him&s;elf in &s;o much Noi&s;e), who
pre&s;ently took Care that the greatbellied Lady was made a Pri&s;oner in her
Chamber, &s;trictly guarded, that She could not go out of tho&s;e Lodgings
which were a&s;&s;igned her; all her own Servants removed from her, and
others appointed to attend; and all other Things &s;upplied that She could
&s;tand in Need of or require, Liberty only excepted. Yet in this clo&s;e Re|&s;traint
<MILESTONE N="20">She found Means to adverti&s;e her Father of the Condition She was in,
and made it much wor&s;e than it was, &s;eeming to apprehend the Safety of
her Life threatened by the Malice of the Counte&s;s, Mother to her Hu&s;band,
&startq;who,&endq; She &s;aid, &startq;did all She could to alienate his Affection from her;
and now that She found She was with Child, would per&s;uade him that it
was not his; and took all this extreme Cour&s;e, either to make her mi&s;carry
and &s;o endanger her Life, or to put an End to Mother and Child when
She &s;hould mi&s;carry:&endq; And therefore be&s;ought her Father, &startq;that He would
find &s;ome Way to procure her Liberty, and to remove her from that Place,
as the only Means to &s;ave her Life.&endq;</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30">THE Marquis, with the Pa&s;&s;ion of a Father, and Confidence of his Daugh|ter's
Virtue, and having no Reverence for the Counte&s;s, thought it an Act
of great Barbarity, and con&s;ulted whether He could have any Remedy at
Law to recover his Daughter's Liberty; and finding little Hope from thence
(the Re&s;traint of a Wife by the Jealou&s;y of her Hu&s;band in his own Hou&s;e
being not a Crime the Law had provided a Remedy again&s;t) He re&s;orted
then to the King, who as little knew how to meddle in it. In the mean
Time He &s;ent Women to &s;ee and attend his Daughter, who were admitted
to &s;ee and confer with her, but not to &s;tay with her; the Counte&s;s declaring,
&startq;that She &s;hould want Nothing; but that &s;ince it was impo&s;&s;ible that the
<MILESTONE N="40">Child could be of Kin to her Son, who had not &s;een her in &s;o many
Months before the Child mu&s;t have been got, She would provide that there
&s;hould be no more foul Play, when She &s;hould be delivered; and after that
Time She &s;hould have no more Re&s;traint or Re&s;idence in that Hou&s;e, but
be at Liberty to go whither She would.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Conclu&s;ion was: The Lady was delivered, and a Son born, who
was quickly chri&s;tened by the Name of <HI>Ignoto,</HI> and committed to a poor
Woman, who lived near, to be nur&s;ed; and as &s;oon as the Lady recovered
Strength enough, She was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed and &s;ent to a Hou&s;e of her Father, who
received her with the Affection He thought was due to her. And having
<MILESTONE N="50">conferred and examined her with all the Strictne&s;s He could, He remained
&s;atisfied in her Innocence, and con&s;equently of the barbarous Treatment She
had received, and the Injury and Indignity, both to him and her, that was
done to the Son; for which He was re&s;olved to leave no Way untried in
<PB N="388" REF="394">
which He might receive a Vindication. In Order to which He fir&s;t de&s;ired the
King to hear all Parties, who was prevailed with to appoint a Day for the doing
it, being attended by &s;ome Bi&s;hops and other Lords of his Council; when
the Marquis and his Daughter, and the Lord <HI>Roos</HI> and his Mother, appeared,
with more Ladies than could have the Patience to &s;tay till the End of the
Examination, where there were &s;o many indecent and uncleanly Particulars
mentioned, that made all the Auditors very weary. Nor was there any
Room for his Maje&s;ty to interpo&s;e towards a Reconciliation, which was in
View impo&s;&s;ible; nor could the Lady be excu&s;ed for a great Delight She
took in making her Hu&s;band jealous of her, and in expre&s;&s;ing a Contempt<MILESTONE N="10">
of him, whatever el&s;e She was guilty of: And &s;o the King left it as He
found it. And the Marquis, who had heard many Things He did not
expect to have heard, took his Daughter to his own Hou&s;e, that by her
own &s;trict Behaviour She might be&s;t vindicate her&s;elf from the Scandal She
lay under: But She quickly freed him from that Hope and Expectation;
for within a &s;hort Time after, She, not being able to &s;ubmit to the &s;trict
Order and Di&s;cipline of her Father's Hou&s;e, which would not permit tho&s;e
Wanderings She de&s;ired to make, nor the Vi&s;its She de&s;ired to receive, made
an E&s;cape from thence, and lodged her&s;elf at more Liberty, and lived in
that Manner as gave too much Evidence again&s;t her with Reference to the<MILESTONE N="20">
Time that was pa&s;t.</P>
<P>THE Marquis, who was a Man of great Honour, and mo&s;t punctual in
all Things relating to Ju&s;tice, gave a noble In&s;tance of Both, and how much
He dete&s;ted the ba&s;e and unworthy Behaviour of his own Child, when it was
manife&s;t to him. He went to the other noble Family, a&s;ked their Pardon
&startq;for his Incredulity, and for any Offence He had committed again&s;t them,
or Reproach He laid upon them, for the Vindication of an unworthy Wo|man,
who He believed now had de&s;erved all and more A&s;per&s;ions than
had been laid on her: And therefore He was ready to join with them to
free the Family, as much as was po&s;&s;ible, from the Infamy She had<MILESTONE N="30">
brought to them and him, and that her ba&s;e I&s;&s;ue might not be an eter|nal
Reproach in their Family.&endq; Upon this She was fir&s;t, upon the Com|plaint
of her Hu&s;band, cited into the Court of the Arches before the Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical
Judges: Where, after a full Examination of Witne&s;&s;es on Both
Sides, and hearing what She could allege in her own Defence, her Crime was
declared to be proved &s;ufficiently; and thereupon a Judgment was pronounced
&startq;of a full and entire Separation <HI>a Toro et a Men&s;&acirc; pro Cau&s;&acirc; Adulterii,&endq;</HI> in
&s;uch a Form, and with &s;uch Circum&s;tances, as are of Cour&s;e in tho&s;e Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>BUT all this was not Remedy enough again&s;t the Ba&s;tard's Title to the
Honour of that illu&s;trious Family: And therefore there was a Bill prepared,<MILESTONE N="40">
wherein all the foul Carriage of the Lady was &s;et out, the Birth and Chri&s;|tening
of <HI>Ignoto,</HI> the Declaration and Judgment of the Court of the Arches,
and Separation of the Parties for the Adultery proved; and thereupon a
De&s;ire that it might be declared by Act of Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bill brought in for this Purpo&s;e.</NOTE> &startq;that the Son, <HI>Ig|noto</HI>
by Name, is a Ba&s;tard, and incapable to inherit any Part of the
Title, Honour or E&s;tate of or belonging to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Rutland;</HI> and
the &s;ame Incapacity to attend all other Children, which from that Time,
the Birth of <HI>Ignoto,</HI> had or might be born from the Body of that Lady.&endq;
And this Bill being pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e of Peers by a Lord nearly al|lied
to that Family, the Earl of <HI>Rutland</HI> being pre&s;ent with the Marquis,<MILESTONE N="50">
as &s;oon as it was read the Marquis &s;tood up, and &startq;with Expre&s;&s;ions of
Trouble, and of the Ju&s;tice that was due to the Greatne&s;s of a noble
Hou&s;e, that had received a foul Blemi&s;h by a Woman of too near a Re|lation
<PB N="389" REF="395">
to him, of whom He was a&s;hamed,&endq; gave his free Con&s;ent to the
Bill, and de&s;ired that it might pa&s;s: And the Earl likewi&s;e be&s;ought the
Hou&s;e, &startq;that &s;o infamous a Branch might not be ingrafted into his Family,
of which his Son the Lord <HI>Roos</HI> was the &s;ole Heir Male, with whom the
Honour mu&s;t expire.&endq;</P>
<P>IT was a Ca&s;e of general Concernment as well as Compa&s;&s;ion, that an
impudent Woman &s;hould have the Power to give an Heir to inherit a noble
Title and Fortune by De&s;cent, when it was &s;o notoriou&s;ly known and ad|judged
to be illegitimate, and a mere Stranger to the Blood of the Hou&s;e.
<MILESTONE N="10">Yet there were &s;ome very good Lords, and who dete&s;ted the Woman and
the Wickedne&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some Lords a|gain&s;t a Precedent of this Nature.</NOTE> made much Scruple of making a new Precedent in a par|ticular
Ca&s;e, that undermined a Foundation of Law, and opened a Door
to let in an unju&s;t Declaration, upon Pretences not &s;o well proved, to the
Di&s;inheri&s;on of one that &s;hould not be illegitimate. But though it was a
rare Ca&s;e, it was found not to be a new one, there having been one or two
Declarations of Ba&s;tardy in Parliament in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> VII.
and <HI>Henry</HI> VIII.</P>
<P>HOWEVER it was as ju&s;t that She &s;hould be heard, to defend both her&s;elf
and her Son; and therefore the Bill being read the &s;econd Time, it was
<MILESTONE N="20">committed, with Direction &startq;that the Lady &s;hould have per&s;onal Notice to
attend, before the Committee entered upon it:&endq; And after long Inquiry
at the Places where She u&s;ed to be, it was found that She had tran&s;ported
her&s;elf into <HI>Ireland,</HI> in the Company of the Per&s;on whom She had preferred
before her Hu&s;band; and there was Rea&s;on to believe, that it was after She
had Notice of the Bill. However all Proceedings were re&s;pited till there
was full Proof given to the Hou&s;e, by the Per&s;on him&s;elf who had &s;poken
with her in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and given her the Warrant that required her Attend|ance
upon the Committee: And then, after many Days longer Delay, it
was read and debated, and by the Committee reported to the Hou&s;e to be
<MILESTONE N="30">engro&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>AND then,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Duke of</HI> Buckingham <HI>ob&s;tructs the Bill.</HI></NOTE> and not till then, the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> oppo&s;ed the pa&s;&s;|ing
of it, upon Pretence, &startq;that in the Bill the Lord <HI>Roos</HI> had a&s;&s;umed a
Title that belonged to him by his Mother, who had been Heir Female
to <HI>Francis</HI> Earl of <HI>Rutland;</HI>&endq; when that Title, now challenged, had de|&s;cended
to <HI>George</HI> the Brother of <HI>Francis,</HI> and had been enjoyed by two Earls
of <HI>Rutland</HI> &s;ince. It was generally thought a &s;trange Exception: Nor was
it known, whether the Duke was di&s;po&s;ed to it as a Revenge upon the
Marquis, or to &s;hew his own Power (for He had many who concurred with
him in Both Hou&s;es upon many Occa&s;ions), or whether He did in Truth
<MILESTONE N="40">de&s;ire to &s;upport the Lady in her Infamy, He not being over-tender in Ca&s;es
of that Nature. However it was nece&s;&s;ary to recommit the Bill, that &s;ome
Expedient might be there found to remove the Ob&s;truction, which though
He was ob&s;tinate in till the Hou&s;e was tired with many Days Debate upon
it, in which mo&s;t of his Adherents upon the Unrea&s;onablene&s;s left him, He
per&s;i&s;ted &s;till and maintained the Debate almo&s;t alone, till the Time of the
Se&s;&s;ion approached; when the Lord <HI>Roos</HI> was compelled to humour him in
leaving out a Title that all the World gave him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">But it is at length pa&s;&s;ed.</NOTE> And then, after into|lerable
Vexation to the Hou&s;e and Lo&s;s of Time, He de&s;i&s;ted to appear
again&s;t it; and the Act pa&s;&s;ed the Royal A&s;&s;ent.</P>
<MILESTONE N="50">
<P>THE ill Humour of the Hou&s;e of Commons was not abated; and though
They knew well that their <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Bill could never have pa&s;&s;ed the upper Hou&s;e
but by the King's powerful Interpo&s;ition, They remained &s;till jealous, or pre|tended
to be &s;o, that He would not give his A&s;&s;ent; which till He &s;hould do,
<PB N="390" REF="396">
They would admit no Debate of Money: So that as &s;oon as the Bill was pre|&s;ented
to him, his Maje&s;ty came to the Hou&s;e of Peers, and &s;ent for the Com|mons
to attend him upon the 18th Day of <HI>January;</HI> when, after He had given
his Con&s;ent to that and another private Bill which They had pre&s;ented, He told
them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King pa&s;&s;es the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Bill with a Speech.</NOTE> &startq;that He had now pa&s;&s;ed their Bills, and that He had been in Hope
to have had other Bills ready to have pa&s;&s;ed too.&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;that He
could not forget, that within few Days after their coming together in <HI>Sep|tember,</HI>
Both Hou&s;es had pre&s;ented to him their Vote and Declaration,
<HI>that They would give him a Supply proportionable to his Occa&s;ions;</HI> and the
Confidence of that had made him anticipate that &s;mall Part of his Revenue<MILESTONE N="10">
which was unanticipated, for the Payment of the Seamen; and his Cre|dit
had gone farther than He had Rea&s;on to think it would, but it was
now at an End.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;THIS was the fir&s;t Day,&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;He had heard of a Supply, being
the 18th of <HI>January,</HI> and what it would amount unto, God only knew;
and what Time He had to make &s;uch Preparations as were nece&s;&s;ary to
meet three &s;uch Enemies as He had, They could well enough judge. And
He mu&s;t tell them, what Di&s;cour&s;es &s;oever were abroad, He was not in
any Treaty; but by the Grace of God He would not give over him&s;elf
and them, but would do what was in his Power for Defence of Both. It<MILESTONE N="20">
was high Time for them to make good their Promi&s;e; and it was high
Time for them to be in the Country, as well for the rai&s;ing of Money, as
that the Lords Lieutenants and Deputy-Lieutenants might watch tho&s;e &s;e|ditious
Spirits which were at Work to di&s;turb the publick Peace. And
therefore He was re&s;olved to put an End to that Se&s;&s;ion on <HI>Monday</HI> next
come Sennight, before which Time He de&s;ired that all Things might be
made ready that He was to di&s;patch.&endq; His Maje&s;ty &s;aid, &startq;He was not
willing to complain that They had dealt unkindly with him in a Bill He
had then pa&s;&s;ed, in which They had manife&s;ted a greater Di&s;tru&s;t of him
than He had de&s;erved. He did not pretend to be without Infirmities, but<MILESTONE N="30">
He had never broken his Word to them; and if He did not flatter him|&s;elf,
the Nation had never le&s;s Cau&s;e to complain of Grievances, or the
lea&s;t Inju&s;tice or Oppre&s;&s;ion, than it had had in tho&s;e &s;even Years &s;ince it
had plea&s;ed God to re&s;tore him to them: He would,&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;be glad
to be u&s;ed accordingly.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS little Quickne&s;s in his Maje&s;ty prevailed more upon them, than all
the former Application had done: And now They &s;aw that They &s;hould not
be &s;uffered to continue longer together, They re&s;olved to leave &s;ome Reli&s;h
of their former Duty and Compliance. Not that the Humour was at all re|formed
or abated in tho&s;e who had &s;hewed &s;o much Frowardne&s;s, who &s;till<MILESTONE N="40">
continued as perver&s;e as ever; but They were over-ruled by the major Part
of the Hou&s;e, as They would have been &s;ooner, if it had not been that a
contrary Cour&s;e had been pur&s;fued to what had been formerly. Nor were
They, who had advi&s;ed that Change, willing that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould de|cline
the &s;ame Method, and were much troubled that He had not care&s;&s;ed
the Hou&s;e more in his late Di&s;cour&s;e. And as They had before advi&s;ed his
Maje&s;ty freely and without any Condition to offer the Repeal, and relea&s;e
the Act that had granted the Chimney-Money to him, which was a very
good and a growing Revenue, but They ob&s;erved to be unpopular; upon a
Pre&s;umption (which They a&s;&s;ured him could not fail) that &s;o generous an<MILESTONE N="50">
Action in his Maje&s;ty towards his People would be immediately requited by
a Grant of much greater Value (and They had prevailed in this Coun&s;el, if
the Chancellor and the Trea&s;urer had not with great Re&s;olution oppo&s;ed it,
<PB N="391" REF="397">
and made evident to his Maje&s;ty, &startq;that He ought never to propo&s;e it him&s;elf
though with Conditions, becau&s;e it would make the Grace undervalued,
and the Conditions to be e&s;teemed unrea&s;onable; nor to hearken to any
general Propo&s;ition, or con&s;ent to the Repeal of that Act, without having
a full and equivalent Recompen&s;e (which ought to be very well weighed)
granted in the &s;ame Act of Parliament; for He had now &s;ufficient Evi|dence,
that the con&s;tant Good-Humour of the Hou&s;e was not to be de|pended
upon:&endq; Which confirmed his Maje&s;ty to re&s;olve never to hearken to
the one without the other, and &s;o that Mi&s;chief was prevented): So They were
<MILESTONE N="10">now as de&s;irous that the Hou&s;e of Commons would &s;till pre&s;s the Di&s;patch
of the Bill of Accounts, which re&s;ted in the Lords Hou&s;e; and a&s;&s;ured them,
&startq;that if They would embrace the &s;ame Po&s;itivene&s;s They had done, the
Chancellor would be no more able to hinder the pa&s;&s;ing of that Act, than
He had been to keep his Maje&s;ty from con&s;enting to the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Bill &s;o much
again&s;t his Re&s;olution.&endq; But They and their Friends could not keep up
the &s;ame Spirit of Stubbornne&s;s in the Hou&s;e, nor prevail with the King to
recede from his Purpo&s;e: So that the Bill for Accounts remained &s;till in the
Hou&s;e of Lords not fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. And &s;uch a Progre&s;s was made in the
Hou&s;e of Commons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Supply granted.</NOTE> notwith&s;tanding all Oppo&s;ition, that a Bill for Supply
<MILESTONE N="20">was prepared within the Time pre&s;cribed, though in Re&s;pect of the Propor|tion
not equal to the Occa&s;ions, and entangled &s;till with the &s;ame inconve|nient
Clau&s;es and <HI>Provi&s;os</HI> which had &s;o unwarily been admitted at <HI>Oxford,</HI>
and which made what was granted unapplicable to the procuring ready Mo|ney;
of which his Maje&s;ty was now fully convinced. But the Time was too
&s;hort to labour in the Alteration. And &s;o the Bill, as it was, was &s;ent up to
the Lords, who, after the &s;hort Formality that cannot be avoided, gave it
a Pa&s;&s;age through that Hou&s;e: So that it was now ready for the King.</P>
<P>THE 8th of <HI>February</HI> the King came to the Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Speech at the Prorogation of the Parlia|ment.</NOTE> and the Speaker
of the Hou&s;e pre&s;ented the Bill to the King, who gave his Royal A&s;&s;ent to it,
<MILESTONE N="30">and thanked them for it, with his A&s;&s;urance &startq;that the Money &s;hould be
laid out for the Ends it was given: However,&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;He hoped He
&s;hould live to have Bills of this Nature in the old Style, with fewer <HI>Pro|vi&s;os.&endq;</HI>
He took Notice, &startq;that the Bill of Accounts for the Money that
had been already rai&s;ed &s;ince the War was not offered to him: But,&endq; his
Maje&s;ty &s;aid, &startq;that He would take Care (after &s;o much Noi&s;e) that the
&s;ame &s;hould not be &s;tifled; but that He would i&s;&s;ue out his Commi&s;&s;ion
in the Manner He had formerly promi&s;ed the Hou&s;e of Peers; and the
Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould have very much to an&s;wer, if They &s;hould not di&s;|cover
all Matters of Fraud and Cozenage.&endq; He told them, &startq;the Sea|&s;on
<MILESTONE N="40">of the Year was very far &s;pent, in which the Enemy had got great
Advantage; but by the Help of God, He would make all the Prepara|tions
He could, and as fa&s;t as He could: And yet He would tell them,
that if any good Overtures were made for an honourable Peace, He would
not reject them; and He believed all &s;ober Men would be glad to &s;ee it
brought to pa&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;HE would now prorogue them till towards Winter, that They might in
their &s;everal Places intend the Peace and Security of their &s;everal Coun|tries,
where there were unquiet Spirits &s;till working. He did pray them,
and&endq; &s;aid &startq;He did expect it from them, that They would u&s;e their ut|mo&s;t
<MILESTONE N="50">Endeavours to remove all tho&s;e fal&s;e Imaginations out of the Hearts
of the People, which the Malice of ill Men had indu&s;triou&s;ly infu&s;ed into
them, of He knew not what Jealou&s;ies and Grievances: For He mu&s;t tell
them again, and He was &s;ure He was in the Right, <HI>that the People had never
<PB N="392" REF="398">
&s;o little Cau&s;e to complain of Oppre&s;&s;ion and Grievances, as They had &s;ince
his Return to them.</HI> If the Taxes and Impo&s;itions were grievous and heavy
upon them, They would put them in Mind, that a War with &s;uch pow|erful
Enemies could not be maintained without Taxes; and He was &s;ure
the Money rai&s;ed thereby came not into his Pur&s;e.&endq; He concluded &startq;with
promi&s;ing him&s;elf good Effects from their Affections and Wi&s;doms, where|ever
They were: And He did hope They &s;hould all meet again of one
Mind, for his Honour, and the Good of the Kingdom.&endq; And &s;o They
were prorogued to the 10th Day of <HI>October</HI> next.</P>
<P>AND now the King had very much to do,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King ap|$s Commi&s;|ers for in $ing pub-Accounts.</NOTE> more than He had Time or<MILESTONE N="10">
Tools to di&s;patch. Yet He began fir&s;t where the Parliament left off, that
when They came again together They might have no Cau&s;e to &s;ay, that He
had not performed what He had promi&s;ed, and &s;o with the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ion
renew their Clamour upon the Accounts, which was made now a very po|pular
Complaint; and whoever was accu&s;ed of ob&s;tructing that Examination,
was pre&s;ently concluded to have had a Share in the Prey. Yet He was not willing
that &s;uch a &s;trict Account or Examination &s;hould be made, e&s;pecially into
the Receipt of the Lord <HI>A&s;hley</HI> for the Prizes, that all the World &s;hould know
what Money had been i&s;&s;ued out by his own immediate Orders, and to
whom. Hereupon He commanded his Attorney and Solicitor General to<MILESTONE N="20">
prepare a Commi&s;&s;ion, with all nece&s;&s;ary Clau&s;es, to call all Per&s;ons to Ac|count
who had received any &s;uch Monies, and to examine and take any
Exception to the &s;ame.</P>
<P>AND that there might be no ju&s;t Exception to the Commi&s;&s;ion, which
He knew would be &s;trictly looked into, They were required &startq;to advi&s;e with
all or any of the Judges, that it might have their Approbation; and that
there &s;hould be a Clau&s;e in the Commi&s;&s;ion, whereby the Commi&s;&s;ioners
&s;hould be authori&s;ed to call any of the Judges to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, when
upon any Matters of Difficulty They &s;hould think it nece&s;&s;ary.&endq; And that
there might be no Exception to any of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, as like to be par|tial<MILESTONE N="30">
in Re&s;pect of Friend&s;hip or Alliance to any of tho&s;e who were to be

that a very exact Account &s;hould be required, and of &s;uch others
who had no Relation to the Court, and were looked upon with the utmo&s;t

to what Place They plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>WE are now to enter upon the Occurrences of the Year 1667, a Year
little more pro&s;perous to the Publick than the Year preceding, and fatal in
Re&s;pect to many calamitous Accidents to the Chancellor, and which put a
Period to his Greatne&s;s; the Circum&s;tances whereof, very notorious, were
&s;o interwoven with the publick Tran&s;actions of State, that it is not ea&s;y to
make a di&s;tinct and clear Relation of the one without the other.<MILESTONE N="50"></P>
<P>THE Temper the Parliament had been in,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King in|volved in great Difficulties.</NOTE> and the Delay They had u&s;ed
in giving the King any Supply towards the carrying on the War, made the

<PB N="393" REF="399">
They had already departed from that Spirit with which They fir&s;t had per|&s;uaded
him to enter into that War: And it was as evident (which had been
often foretold to him) that the <HI>Dutch</HI> could endure being beaten longer than
He could endure to beat them. They were now relieved and &s;upplied with
the Money of <HI>France,</HI> and the governing Party had &s;ubdued all Contradic|tions;
and whatever their Affections were, all Compliance and Submi&s;&s;ion
appeared to the Commands of the State; and there wanted Nothing but
the Sea&s;on of the Year to carry their Fleet again to Sea, as great and as
well provided as it had ever been. All Murmuring was tran&s;planted from
<MILESTONE N="10">thence into <HI>England,</HI> where it grew up plentifully: And the King was,
upon the Credit of an Act of Parliament that was pa&s;&s;ed on the 8th of <HI>Fe|bruary,</HI>
to provide a Fleet ready to encounter with the potent Enemies in the
Spring. There was no Trade by Sea, and therefore could not be much by
Land, that could bring any Benefit to the King; and the Seamen ran all to
the Privateers, who adventured for Booty, which They preferred before &s;erv|ing
in the Royal Navy.</P>
<P>THE King in tho&s;e Streights called that Council together with whom He
u&s;ed to con&s;ult his mo&s;t &s;ecret Affairs;<NOTE PLACE="marg">He con&s;ults the private Com|mittee upon the perplexing State of his Affairs.</NOTE> and the chief Officers at Sea, and
the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Navy, attended to give &s;uch Information as was
<MILESTONE N="20">nece&s;&s;ary before any Re&s;olution could be taken. There the whole State of
the Navy was inquired into; what was in the Stores, and what the Defects or
Deficiencies were, and what Hopes there were of &s;upplying them; what
Ships were ready, and what would be made ready in three Months. The
Victualler was &s;ent for to give an Account what Provi&s;ion of Victuals was
ready, and what could be provided and put on Board in the &s;ame Time,
which was the utmo&s;t that could be limited. Every Officer prote&s;ted, &startq; that
there could not be the lea&s;t Attempt towards any Preparations without a
good Sum of ready Money:&endq; And the Yards were in that Nece&s;&s;ity by
Rea&s;on of the great Arrear of Wages that was due to them, that They were
<MILESTONE N="30">near a Mutiny, and could not be kept to their Work, being nece&s;&s;itated to
do any Work abroad to get Victual for their Families. The inferiour Of|ficers,
which belonged to the Stores, lived by &s;tealing and &s;elling what They
were entru&s;ted to keep. In &s;hort: All Things were pre&s;ented to be in that
Confu&s;ion, that there appeared no Probability of being able to &s;et out any
Fleet before the Enemy would be &s;o &s;trong upon the Coa&s;t, that it would be
very difficult to make a Conjunction between tho&s;e Ships which were in the
River, and the other which were at <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> and in other Ports.</P>
<P>THIS de&s;perate Repre&s;entation did not make the King take a &s;udden Re|&s;olution:
But the &s;ame Council met many Days Morning and Evening. All
<MILESTONE N="40">Ways were thought upon which might admini&s;ter Hope to get any Money;
and Con&s;iderations were entered upon what was to be done in Ca&s;e a Fleet
could not be provided fit to engage the Enemy, and which Way a defen&s;ive
War was to be made at Sea, and how the Trade &s;hould be &s;ecured, and the
Coa&s;ts and Harbours be &s;o pre&s;erved, that the Enemy might do no Affront
at Land; for every Day brought loo&s;e and ungrounded Intelligence of Bodies
of Hor&s;e and Foot, drawn in <HI>France</HI> to the Sea&s;ide in many Places upon
that large Coa&s;t, and likewi&s;e in <HI>Holland,</HI> and great Provi&s;ion of Flatbot|toms,
as if They intended to make &s;ome De&s;cent; which Kind of Rumours
exceedingly di&s;compo&s;ed the common People, though They who under&s;tood
<MILESTONE N="50">the Expeditions of that Nature, and with what Difficulty Land Armies
were tran&s;ported, were not moved by tho&s;e Reports. After all Expedients
were con&s;idered and well weighed, his Maje&s;ty found Cau&s;e to de&s;pair of
<PB N="394" REF="400">
being able to &s;et out in any Time a Fleet equal to the Occa&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Re&s;olution taken to act on the Defen&s;ive.</NOTE> and &s;o
contracted his Thoughts to the other Part, for the Defen&s;ive.</P>
<P>THERE is a Point of Land on the <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Coa&s;t that extends it&s;elf into
the Sea, and at the very Entrance of the River, where the King had often
thought and di&s;cour&s;ed of erecting a Royal Fort, that would both pre&s;erve
the Coa&s;t, and likewi&s;e be a great Security to the River: And the pro&s;e|cuting
this De&s;ign was in this Con&s;ultation thought of great Importance, and
the erecting another Fort in another Place, and repairing and &s;trengthening
<HI>Landguard Point</HI> upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Suffolk.</HI></P>
<P>FOR Preparations for the Sea, it was thought fit and enough, &startq;that a<MILESTONE N="10">
good Squadron of light Frigats &s;hould ride on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
and another of the &s;ame Strength lie off <HI>Plymouth,</HI> Both which &s;hould
intercept the Trade of <HI>Holland</HI> both outward and inward, if They did not
maintain it with &s;trong Convoys, which would break their Fleet; and in
tho&s;e Ca&s;es the Frigats would ea&s;ily retire to their Harbours. That &s;ome
Frigats &s;hould be always in the <HI>Downs,</HI> to cha&s;e Picaroons from infe&s;ting
the Coa&s;t, and to ob&s;erve and get Intelligence of the Enemies Motion,
and upon Occa&s;ion &s;hould retire up the River. That there &s;hould be
&s;ome of the greate&s;t Ships at <HI>Chatham, Port&s;mouth</HI> and other Places, pre|pared
and put in Readine&s;s again&s;t the End of Summer, before which<MILESTONE N="20">
Time Money might be provided: And then the Enemies Fleet being
weary and &s;oul, it might be pre&s;umed the <HI>French</HI> would return early into
their own Ports, which were &s;o far off; and then the Frigats from the
<HI>We&s;t</HI> and the <HI>North</HI> might find the Way to join with the great Ships,
which &s;hould be ready again&s;t that Time, and either fight the <HI>Dutch</HI> if
They &s;hould choo&s;e it, or infe&s;t their Coa&s;t more than They had done this,
and take all their Ships homeward bound from all Places, which, upon the
Fame of their being Ma&s;ters of the Sea all the Summer, would repair
Home without Apprehen&s;ion of an Enemy.&endq; And there were &s;ome Of|ficers
of great Experience at Sea, who, being called by the King to advi&s;e<MILESTONE N="30">
upon this Project, declared with Confidence, &startq;that the <HI>Dutch</HI> would be
greater Lo&s;ers by the War thus conducted the next Summer, than They
had been in any Year &s;ince the War begun.&endq;</P>
<P>FOR the Security of Trade, it was declared, &startq;that there was no po&s;&s;ible
Way to &s;ecure it but by re&s;training it, and not &s;uffering any Merchants
Ships to go to Sea, and by giving them Advice to &s;end to all their Factors
and Corre&s;pondents, <HI>that They &s;hould &s;end no Goods Home till They received
new Orders:</HI>&endq; Which Re&s;traint &s;ome were again&s;t, &startq;both becau&s;e it
would have an ill Reception with the People, when They &s;hould find that
a War, which had been entered into for the Enlargement and Advance|ment<MILESTONE N="40">
of Trade, had produced a Ce&s;&s;ation of all Trade; and it would ap|pear
very hard that Men, who had laid out their own Stocks and were
willing to venture them, &s;hould be forbid and hindered from &s;ending
them to tho&s;e Markets for which They had provided them, which would
turn to little le&s;s Lo&s;s to them than They &s;hould incur by their being
taken by the Enemy. Then it would be, not a Di&s;couragement but a
Di&s;&s;ipation of the Seamen, who, if They could have no Employment
in the King's Ships or in the Merchant Ships, would be &s;cattered abroad
to &s;eek their Fortune, &s;o that They would not be brought together when
the King had Occa&s;ion for their Service. In the la&s;t Place: That the<MILESTONE N="50">
giving this Order for Re&s;traint, and Advice to the Merchants to inform
their Factors and Corre&s;pondents, would be, and could not choo&s;e but be,
<PB N="395" REF="401">
an ab&s;olute Publication of this Re&s;olution of the King to &s;end out no Fleet
in the Spring; which was yet agreed to be the highe&s;t Secret.&endq;</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e Rea&s;ons were temperately weighed and an&s;wered. &startq;That it
could not be unrea&s;onable or unju&s;t to hinder Men from doing them|&s;elves
Harm: The King could not take their Goods from them to his
own U&s;e; but He might lawfully hinder them from &s;poiling or de&s;troy|ing
the Goods that were their own. That their being taken by the
Enemy (which would be unavoidable) concerned the King and the King|dom
little le&s;s than it did the private Owners: It would increa&s;e the
<MILESTONE N="10">In&s;olence and the Wealth of the Enemy, and reflect upon his Maje&s;ty's
Honour as well as impoveri&s;h his Subjects; and the Difference would be
very great between lo&s;ing their Goods, and keeping them upon their Hands
for a better Market. For the Di&s;&s;ipation of the Seamen, there would no
great Danger be of that: The Squadrons on the We&s;tern and the Northern
Coa&s;ts, which mu&s;t be very well manned, would entertain good Num|bers;
and the re&s;t would put them&s;elves on Board the Privateers, who
&s;hould be all bound to come Home again&s;t the Time the King would have
Occa&s;ion for their Service, and then the Privateers &s;hould be re&s;trained as
now the Merchants. For the keeping the pre&s;ent Re&s;olution &s;ecret, which
<MILESTONE N="20">would by this Means be publi&s;hed, it were to be de&s;ired that it might re|main
a Secret as long as &s;hould be po&s;&s;ible: But as di&s;cerning Men would
ea&s;ily di&s;cover it, and could not but already know that it was impo&s;&s;ible
for the King in Time to &s;et out a Fleet, &s;o it would quickly be evident
to all the World; and the Secret was not to be affected longer than it could
be concealed.&endq;</P>
<P>THERE was another Inconvenience or Mi&s;chief that was in View, that
would <HI>come like an armed Man</HI> upon the City, which was Want of Fewel,
e&s;pecially the Want of Coals from <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> of which there had been a
va&s;t Quantity con&s;umed in the late Fire, which had likewi&s;e con&s;umed tho&s;e
<MILESTONE N="30">Hou&s;es and Chimnies which &s;hould be &s;upplied; yet the People remained
&s;till, and were not like to be much the warmer for being crowded clo&s;er
together. But to that there could no other Remedy applied, but the &s;end|ing
Orders to <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> to employ all their Ships, and all They could
procure, in &s;ending as much Coal as was po&s;&s;ible to <HI>London</HI> and the Towns
adjacent, before the Enemies Fleet could put to Sea; and Convoys were
a&s;&s;igned too &s;trong for their Privateers or &s;mall Parties of their Men of War:
And the King gave two or three Ve&s;&s;els of his own, and likewi&s;e Money, to
fetch Coals, that the Poor might have them at the Rates they co&s;t; and di|rected
the City to do the &s;ame. All which produced &s;ome good Effect.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40">UPON the whole Matter, and thorough Examination of the Whole, the
King concluded upon all the Particulars mentioned before, a&s;&s;igning proper
Per&s;ons to &s;upervi&s;e every Particular, that all &s;hould be executed in Time
that was agreed upon. The Duke i&s;&s;ued out all his Orders to the Ships,
with which Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> was charged,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King in|&s;pects the $$a|tification, of</HI> Sheerne$.</NOTE> who&s;e Office it was: And
the King would charge him&s;elf with that which was mo&s;t important, the
Fortification at <HI>Sheerne&s;s;</HI> whither his Maje&s;ty made a Journey in the Cold
and Depth of Winter, and took an Engineer and &s;ome Officers of the Ord|nance
with him, that all Things might be &s;upplied from thence which be|longed
to that Office. He cau&s;ed Ma&s;ter-Workmen to be &s;ent from <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="50">and drew common Labourers enough out of the Country, having pro|vided
Money to pay them. And after all Things were in this Order, and
He had &s;een the Work begun, He left the Ma&s;ter-Engineer, whom He de|&s;igned
to be the Governour of the Fort, for which He was very equal, upon
<PB N="396" REF="402">
the Place; and committed the overlooking of the Whole, that all po&s;&s;ible
Expedition might be u&s;ed, to one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Ordnance,
who promi&s;ed to look carefully to it: And his Maje&s;ty returned to <HI>London,</HI>
when in the Opinion of all his Servants He had &s;tayed too long in &s;uch a
Sea&s;on, and &s;uch an Air, to the Danger of his Health. How all tho&s;e Re|&s;olutions
and Orders were executed afterwards, or complied with, mu&s;t un|avoidably
be mentioned in its Place.</P>
<P>IT cannot be imagined by any Man who in any Degree knew him, that
the Chancellor, though He was pre&s;ent, could have any Part in the&s;e Re&s;o|lutions
but the &s;ubmitting to them; every Particular being &s;o much out of<MILESTONE N="10">
his Sphere, that He never pretended to under&s;tand what was fit and rea|&s;onable
to be done: Nor throughout the whole Conduct of the War was
He ever known to pre&s;ume to give an Advice; but pre&s;uming that all who&s;e
Profe&s;&s;ion it was advi&s;ed what was fit, He readily concurred. And He did
always declare, &startq;that in this la&s;t Con&s;ultation all Points were &s;o fully de|bated;
and that there was &s;o concurrent an Opinion in the Commanders
of the Ships, and the Officers of the Navy, with the Approbation of the
Duke of <HI>York,</HI> Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> and the General, <HI>that it was not po&s;&s;ible to
&s;et out a Fleet in Time equal to that of the Enemy, to engage with it; and
that the next be&s;t would be to &s;tand upon the Defen&s;ive in the Manner pro|po&s;ed:</HI><MILESTONE N="20">
That it did not appear to him, that there was any Election left but
to pur&s;ue that Cour&s;e,&endq; which He did believe very rea&s;onably propo&s;ed and
re&s;olved upon; nor did any Thing occur to him, why very much Good
might not be hoped from it, He being &s;o totally un&s;kilful in the Knowledge
of the Coa&s;t and the River, that He knew not where <HI>Sheerne&s;s</HI> was, nor
had ever heard of the Name of &s;uch a Place till this la&s;t Di&s;cour&s;e, nor had
ever been upon any Part of the River with any other Thought about him,
than to get on Shore as &s;oon as could be po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>THE King had not him&s;elf thought of this defen&s;ive Way, but approved
it very much when He heard it &s;o fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and in which him&s;elf had<MILESTONE N="30">
propo&s;ed all his Doubts, which no Man rai&s;ed more pertinently in Arguments
of that Nature than his Maje&s;ty; and it may be He liked it the better, be|cau&s;e
at that Time, as He was heartily weary of the War, &s;o He was not
without a rea&s;onable Hope of Peace, which He re&s;olved to cheri&s;h, as He
told the Parliament at parting He would do. The Grounds of which Hope,
and the Progre&s;s thereupon, the entering upon a Treaty, and the Conclu&s;ion
thereof, will be the Di&s;cour&s;e and Relation We &s;hall next enter upon.</P>
<P>How ill Succe&s;s &s;oever had attended the Negotiation of <HI>Denmark</HI> by the
Irre&s;olution and Un&s;teadine&s;s of that Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Swedes <HI>di&s;po&s;ed to a&s;|&s;i&s;t the</HI> Eng|li&s;h.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> had conducted

after He had di&s;po&s;ed that Court (where He had rendered him&s;elf extremely
acceptable) to a ju&s;t E&s;teem of the King's Friend&s;hip, and an equal Aver|&s;ion
to the <HI>Hollander,</HI> and concluded &s;uch Articles as were for the pre&s;ent
and joint Convenience and Benefit of Both Nations, and prepared them to
be willing to enter into a &s;tricter and nearer Alliance, and to that Purpo&s;e
to &s;end Amba&s;&s;adours into <HI>England,</HI> where They had an Agent; He re|turned
to give his Maje&s;ty an Account and Information of the Con&s;titution
and Temper of that Court, and of the Nature and Di&s;po&s;ition of the two
Amba&s;&s;adours who were to attend his Maje&s;ty, who were cho&s;en before He
left <HI>Stockholm,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They &s;end Amba&s;&s;adours into</HI> England.</NOTE> and re&s;olved to embark within ten Days: Which They did,<MILESTONE N="50">
and arrived about the Time, or &s;oon after, that the City was &s;o mi&s;erably
de&s;troyed by Fire; which was the le&s;s favourable Conjuncture, not &s;o much
by the Influence that dreadful Di&s;traction and Damage was like to have
<PB N="397" REF="403">
upon the vigorous carrying on the War, as by the ill Humour which the
Parliament &s;hortly after appeared to be in, and their manife&s;t Ob&s;tinacy
again&s;t the King's De&s;ires; which was a Temper very different from what
They expected to have found, and what They had been informed had po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
them from the Time of his Maje&s;ty's Return. Nor was this manife&s;t
Indi&s;po&s;ition without &s;ome unhappy Impre&s;&s;ion upon the Spirits of the Am|ba&s;&s;adours,
and that Alacrity They brought with them pre&s;ently to enter
into a Treaty, and Conjunction of Forces again&s;t the common Enemy.</P>
<P>IT was manife&s;t enough, that the Crown of <HI>Sweden</HI> was weary of the
<MILESTONE N="10">Obligations They had been long bound in to <HI>France,</HI> which had &s;uperci|liou&s;ly
neglected of late to comply with what was on their Part to be per|formed;
and rather endeavoured to make Alliances with <HI>Denmark,</HI> and the
le&s;&s;er neighbour Princes, as tho&s;e of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> and <HI>Lunen|burg,</HI>
to their Di&s;advantage, than to con&s;ider that Crown which had been
&s;o u&s;eful to them, as if their Friend&s;hip was &s;o con&s;iderable to them. Nor
was this out of a real Di&s;e&s;teem of them; but that They might bind them
to a fa&s;ter Dependance upon them, and that They might not be &s;evered
from their Intere&s;t, what&s;oever They &s;hould declare it to be. And there|fore,
when it was fir&s;t &s;u&s;pected that They might be inclined to <HI>England,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="20">and <HI>Holland</HI> apprehended that They might be induced to make a Con|junction
with the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mun&s;ter, France</HI> (as hath been touched before)
&s;ent their Amba&s;&s;adour <HI>Pompone</HI> into <HI>Sweden,</HI> with a full Year's Salary of
what was in Arrear, much more &s;till remaining due, and to incline that
Crown to a Neutrality between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the <HI>Dutch;</HI> in which He
found Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> had prevented him, and though He had not then the
Character of Amba&s;&s;adour, He was much better re&s;pected there than He
was. And as They would have joined with the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> if He
had advanced according to his Pretence, or had not been ab&s;olutely taken
off by <HI>France;</HI> &s;o, when He was diverted from his Purpo&s;e, They were the
<MILESTONE N="30">more inclined to make a firm Alliance with <HI>England,</HI> and thereby &s;uch a
farther Conjunction with other Princes, Prote&s;tant or Catholick, that might
give &s;ome Check to the impetuous Humour of <HI>France,</HI> which They now
were as jealous of, and of their overflowing all the Banks which belonged to
their Neighbours, as They had been formerly of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria;</HI> and
for the &s;ame Rea&s;on were as de&s;irous to retire from any Dependance upon or
Relation to that Crown, as They had been formerly of its Protection; and
were very well prepared to change their Alliance, and, if They might not
be Lo&s;ers by it, to make a Conjunction with <HI>Germany</HI> and the Hou&s;e of
<HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> into which it was rea&s;onable to be pre&s;umed that the <HI>United Pro|vinces</HI>
<MILESTONE N="40">would be glad to be received upon moderate Conditions, when a Peace
&s;hould be made with <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>AND this was the Pro&s;pect that had been pre&s;ented to them by Mr. <HI>Co|ventry,</HI>
and upon View of which They now &s;ent their Amba&s;&s;adours, with|out
being terrified by the Declaration of <HI>France</HI> on the Behalf of the <HI>Dutch;</HI>
and with a Re&s;olution, if They could not per&s;uade <HI>Holland</HI> to &s;eparate from
that Conjunction, and make a Peace apart with the King (which They la|boured
by their Amba&s;&s;adour the Count of <HI>Dhona</HI> to the <HI>States</HI>) to join their
Intere&s;t frankly to that of his Maje&s;ty, and to run the Hazard and expect
the I&s;&s;ue and Event of the War.</P>
<MILESTONE N="50">
<P>THE two Amba&s;&s;adours were <HI>Flemming</HI> and <HI>Coyet,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Charac|ters of the Amba&s;&s;adours.</NOTE> Both Senators in the

of the greater Place and E&s;teem, being a Nobleman of an ancient and noble
Extraction of a Family in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that had lived through many De&s;cents
<PB N="398" REF="404">
in <HI>Sweden</HI> in great Employment and Lu&s;tre; and this Man never di&s;&s;embled
a particular Devotion to the King, and for that Rea&s;on principally was de|&s;igned
to this Negotiation. The other was not &s;o well born or bred, or
of &s;o cheerful a Complexion, but a more thinking and melancholick Man,
more conver&s;ant in Books, and more ver&s;ed in the Cour&s;e and Forms of
Bu&s;ine&s;s; and by his own Virtue and humble Indu&s;try had from a mean
and low Birth, which in tho&s;e Northern Kingdoms is the highe&s;t Di&s;ad|vantage,
by Degrees a&s;cended to the Degree of a Senator, which is the
chiefe&s;t Qualification; and had gotten his fir&s;t Credit and Reputation by a
Negotiation He was intru&s;ted with in <HI>Holland,</HI> and a Treaty well managed<MILESTONE N="10">

having &s;tudied together in <HI>Leyden</HI> when They were young; and their Fa|miliarity
after was improved to a good Corre&s;pondence in that Negotiation
in <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>THIS being well known and commonly &s;poken of there, Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI>
endeavoured to prevent his De&s;ignation to that Employment, by &s;peaking to
the Chancellor of that Kingdom, who always received him with open Arms,
and gave good Te&s;timony of his hearty and pa&s;&s;ionate De&s;ire of a firm Con|junction
between the two Crowns; and, though He was of a <HI>French</HI> Ex|traction,<MILESTONE N="20">
had a full Jealou&s;y of the Want of Sincerity and Ju&s;tice of that
Nation. When He di&s;covered the Apprehen&s;ion Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> had, He
per&s;uaded him to acquie&s;ce in his Judgment rather than to credit common
Rumour: &startq;That He well knew Both, and had contributed to the Election of
Both, who were very fit to be joined together in an Employment of this
Nature, the Gaiety and Warmth of the one &s;tanding in Need &s;ometimes of
the Phlegm of the other, who would yet pay that Reverence to him that
was due to his &s;uperiour Quality; and that He was too good a <HI>Swede</HI> to
have Inclinations to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> how much Conver&s;ation &s;oever He had
with them. In a Word, He would pa&s;s his Word;&endq; which put an End<MILESTONE N="30">
to all farther Doubts: And it was well enough known, that He had been
rai&s;ed by and was a Creature of the Chancellor.</P>
<P>AND in Truth, from the Time of their Arrival in <HI>England</HI> He carried
him&s;elf very fairly, and without any vi&s;ible Inclination to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and
much le&s;s to the <HI>French;</HI> and They Both very frankly declared to tho&s;e of
the King's Mini&s;ters with whom They conferred with Intimacy, &startq;that that

be found to make them no Lo&s;ers by it.&endq; Yet it is as true, that after
They had been &s;ome Months in <HI>England,</HI> and &s;aw in how ill a Po&s;ture the
King was for the carrying on the War, and how far the Parliament was from<MILESTONE N="40">
giving Money, or from any rea&s;onable Compliance with his Maje&s;ty's De|&s;ires,
<HI>Coyet</HI> did not concur with the &s;ame Warmth in his Di&s;patches, with
<HI>Flemming,</HI> into <HI>Sweden;</HI> but writ apart to the Mini&s;ters there, &startq;that They
mu&s;t take new Mea&s;ures, and not depend upon a Conjunction with <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
to which, how well &s;oever the King was inclined, He would not
be able to bear the Part They expected, by Rea&s;on that He had no
Power with the Parliament;&endq; which Letters his Maje&s;ty's Agent then in
<HI>Sweden</HI> had a Sight of: Which produced no other Effect there, but a Re|&s;olution,
that if They &s;aw that either the King was inclined to a Peace, or
would be reduced to a Nece&s;&s;ity to treat, the Amba&s;&s;adours &s;hould offer in<MILESTONE N="50">
the Name of their Ma&s;ter his Interpo&s;ition, which their Mini&s;ters in <HI>France</HI>
and <HI>Holland</HI> &s;hould then likewi&s;e make Proffer of, upon Adverti&s;ement fir&s;t
from them, but with a &s;ecret A&s;&s;urance to the King, &startq;that if a Treaty
<PB N="399" REF="405">
&s;hould not take Effect&endq; (which it could hardly be believed it would do),
the Crown of <HI>Sweden</HI> would firmly unite it&s;elf to his Maje&s;ty's Intere&s;t,
and engage in the War with him;&endq;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sweden <HI>is de|&s;irous of a &s;e|parate Treaty with</HI> Holland.</NOTE> which it was evident They were more
inclined to, than to a Peace in which <HI>France</HI> might be comprehended. But
that which They mo&s;t de&s;ired was, that a Peace might be made with the
<HI>Dutch</HI> without comprehending <HI>France,</HI> in which They would willingly
enter, which would draw <HI>Spain</HI> and all the Princes of <HI>Germany</HI> to de&s;ire to

<P>THE <HI>Conde</HI> of <HI>Molina</HI> was Amba&s;&s;adour from <HI>Spain,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The &s;ame en|deavoured by the</HI> Spani&s;h <HI>and</HI> Imperial <HI>Amba&s;&s;adours.</HI></NOTE> near the King, a
<MILESTONE N="10">Man rather &s;incere than &s;ubtil, and &s;o had the more Need of the Advice
and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Baron of <HI>I&s;ola,</HI> who was, under the Title of Envoy from
the Emperour, entirely tru&s;ted and &s;upported (as mo&s;t of the Emperour's Mi|ni&s;ters
were) by the King of <HI>Spain;</HI> who being a <HI>Burgundian,</HI> born in tho&s;e
Parts which remain &s;ubject to <HI>Spain,</HI> had an implacable Hatred to the
<HI>French;</HI> and by the Employments He had undergone in <HI>Italy</HI> and other
Places, where He had been Amba&s;&s;adour, had made him&s;elf &s;o con&s;iderable,
that He was become notoriou&s;ly odious to the <HI>French,</HI> and was a Man of
great Experience and very &s;ubtil Parts. Both tho&s;e Mini&s;ters did heartily
wi&s;h a Peace between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> with the Exclu&s;ion of <HI>France:</HI>
<MILESTONE N="20">But if that could not be, They had much rather the War &s;hould continue
as it was, than that <HI>France</HI> &s;hould be comprehended in the Peace; for
which They had &s;ome Rea&s;on. For at this Time the King of <HI>Spain</HI> died,
which They had too many Rea&s;ons to believe would put an End to the Quiet
of <HI>Flanders;</HI> and therefore would be glad that They might have the A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
of <HI>England</HI> for their Defence, and in which <HI>Holland</HI> could not think
it&s;elf unconcerned. The Probability of this, and the con&s;tant Intelligence
They received from the <HI>Hague,</HI> &startq;that there were already Jealou&s;ies grown
up between the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Dutch,</HI>&endq; per&s;uaded them, and They en|deavoured
to per&s;uade the King, &startq;that <HI>Holland</HI> might be now induced to
<MILESTONE N="30">treat by them&s;elves; or if They could not do that, but mu&s;t proceed
jointly with <HI>France,</HI> They would upon A&s;&s;urance of the King's Affection
&s;ever them&s;elves from them, if They in&s;i&s;ted upon any Thing that was
not for the joint Benefit of all.&endq; The King left them to do what They
thought fit towards it, without undertaking any Thing on his Part until
their fair Intentions were di&s;cerned, and then to a&s;&s;ure them of his Maje&s;ty's
Inclinations to Peace upon ju&s;t and honourable Conditions.</P>
<P>THERE is no Doubt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Holland <HI>and</HI> France <HI>jealous of each other.</HI></NOTE> there was a real Jealou&s;y and Di&s;&s;atisfaction between
<HI>France</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> at this Time. The <HI>Dutch</HI> complained, &startq;that the <HI>French</HI>
had broken their Promi&s;e with them no le&s;s this Year than They had done
<MILESTONE N="40">the la&s;t: They had indeed declared and proclaimed a War, but They had
done no Acts of Ho&s;tility; and whereas They were engaged that their
Fleet &s;hould have joined with theirs in the Month of <HI>May,</HI> They had
never been in View but at a great Di&s;tance, and &s;uffered the <HI>Dutch</HI> to fight
&s;o many Days together without any Help from them. And upon their
renewed Promi&s;e, They had again carried out their Fleet to meet with
them in <HI>Augu&s;t;</HI> when They failed again, and left them expo&s;ed to the
whole <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet: So that They were compelled with &s;ome Lo&s;s to get
again into their Harbours.&endq; And now They had a real Apprehen&s;ion, that
They might treat with <HI>England</HI> apart, and leave them to &s;upport the War
<MILESTONE N="50">at Sea by them&s;elves, whil&s;t They pur&s;ued their Expedition again&s;t <HI>Flanders</HI>
upon the Death of the King of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>ON the other Side, <HI>France</HI> as much complained of the Proceedings of the
<HI>Dutch:</HI> &startq;That after They had received a great Sum of Money from them,
<PB N="400" REF="406">
without which They could not have &s;et out their Fleet, They no more cared
for a Conjunction with their Ships, nor went to that Length at Sea which
They were bound to to join with them; which They might have done, if
They had continued their Cour&s;e when They put to Sea in the Beginning
of <HI>June.</HI> In&s;tead of which They went over to the Coa&s;t of <HI>England</HI> to find
the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> confe&s;&s;ing thereby, that They had no Need of the A&s;&s;i&s;tance
of the <HI>French</HI> Ships; but leaving them to &s;hift for them&s;elves. And after|wards,
in the End of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> They came not to the Place They had
promi&s;ed to have done; by Rea&s;on of which Neglect and Breach of
Faith, if a &s;ingular Act of Providence had not prevented it, their whole<MILESTONE N="10">
Fleet had fallen into the Hands of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as &s;ome Part of it did.&endq;
But that which made them likewi&s;e willing that this War &s;hould be at an
End was, that now, the King of <HI>Spain</HI> being dead, They might enter upon
a War with <HI>Spain;</HI> towards which They prepared <HI>Manife&s;tos</HI> to publi&s;h upon
the Matter of their Right, and already prepared Levies of Men, of which
They could pretend no other U&s;e: Yet They profe&s;&s;ed to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Am|ba&s;&s;adour
to have no &s;uch De&s;ign in their Purpo&s;es. However They would
not enter upon any Treaty apart without the <HI>Dutch:</HI> Nor would <HI>De Wit,</HI>
who entirely governed the Councils of <HI>Holland,</HI> be induced to con&s;ent to
any Overtures made to &s;eparate, before or in the Treaty, from <HI>France;</HI> but<MILESTONE N="20">
gave Information of what&s;oever was propo&s;ed by the Baron of <HI>I&s;ola,</HI> or the
<HI>Spaniard</HI> or any other Per&s;on, to that Purpo&s;e, and enlarged upon that In|formation
more than was true, to endear his own Punctuality.</P>
<P>THE Mother of the King was then at <HI>Paris,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Queen Mother endea|vours to bring about a Peace with</HI> France.</NOTE> having cho&s;en rather to re|&s;ide
there than in <HI>England,</HI> &s;ince She &s;aw the Re&s;olution of a War between
them, and de&s;ired Nothing more than to be an In&s;trument in the compo&s;ing
tho&s;e Differences, which She thought were not good for either of the Crowns;
and found now another Style in that Court than it had u&s;ed to di&s;cour&s;e in,
and, from the Time of the News of the Death of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> that
the <HI>French</HI> King had &s;poken as if He wi&s;hed a Peace with <HI>England:</HI> Where|upon<MILESTONE N="30">
about the Time when the Parliament was prorogued, the Earl of <HI>St.
Albans</HI> came to <HI>London,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>She fends the Earl of</HI> St. Albans <HI>into</HI> England <HI>for that Purpo&s;e.</HI></NOTE> as to look to the Queen's Affairs, of which He
was the great Intendant. He informed the King &startq;of the good Temper the
<HI>French</HI> Court was in, and that He was confident, if his Maje&s;ty would
make any Advance towards a Peace, the Queen would be able to di&s;po&s;e
that King to hearken to it, and to be a Mediator between <HI>England</HI> and
<HI>Holland;</HI> and either to draw them to con&s;ent to what was ju&s;t, or to &s;e|parate
from them: And He thought it very rea&s;onable, that the Condi|tions
&s;hould be referred to the King of <HI>France,</HI> who He was &s;ure, upon
&s;uch a Tru&s;t, would be very careful of the King's Honour and Intere&s;t.&endq;<MILESTONE N="40">
He profe&s;&s;ed &startq;to have no Authority for any Thing He propo&s;ed, from the
<HI>French</HI> King or any of his Mini&s;ters, but from the Queen's Conjectures and
his own Ob&s;ervation: And if the King would give him a Commi&s;&s;ion, He
would pre&s;ently return, and would not be known to have any Powers, till
He &s;hould find &s;uch a Conjuncture to own it, as that the Peace &s;hould be
concluded before there &s;hould be any Di&s;cour&s;e of a Treaty (which He knew
the <HI>French</HI> mo&s;t de&s;ired) le&s;t <HI>Spain</HI> might interpo&s;e to perplex or delay it.&endq;
And therefore He propo&s;ed, &startq;that He might carry In&s;tructions with him,
upon what Conditions the King would be willing that a Peace &s;hould
be e&s;tabli&s;hed.&endq; His Maje&s;ty was re&s;olved never to make the <HI>French</HI><MILESTONE N="50">
King Arbitrator of the Conditions of the Peace, nor that it &s;hould be treated
at <HI>Paris;</HI> and mo&s;t of all, that the Earl of <HI>St. Albans</HI> &s;hould not have any
Power to treat, &startq;who,&endq; the King always u&s;ed to &s;ay, &startq;was more a <HI>French</HI>
<PB N="401" REF="407">
than an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man:&endq; And He likewi&s;e re&s;olved, &startq;that no Overture
&s;hould be made towards Peace in his Name.&endq;</P>
<P>WHILST this was in Su&s;pen&s;e, the Earl received Letters from <HI>Paris,</HI> in
which He was advi&s;ed &startq;to return thither with Power to treat, and with In|formation
what Conditions the King expected; for that his mo&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI>
Maje&s;ty had &s;o prepared the <HI>Dutch,</HI> that He &s;hould have pre&s;ent Power
to treat and conclude; and &s;o all Things might be &s;ettled before the For|mality
of a Treaty &s;hould be entered into or heard of.&endq; This did not
alter the King's Re&s;olution again&s;t authorizing the Earl to treat, or making
<MILESTONE N="10"><HI>Paris</HI> the Place of the Treaty. But becau&s;e the Letters were written by
<HI>Mon&s;ieur Ruvigny,</HI> who was a Per&s;on well known to the King, and of whom
He had a good Opinion, and whom He well knew to be too wary a Man
to write in that Manner without having good Authority to do &s;o; his Ma|je&s;ty
was contented &startq;that the Earl &s;hould make Ha&s;te to <HI>Paris;</HI> and if He
found by <HI>Ruvigny</HI> that what They propo&s;ed was really de&s;ired, He &s;hould
undertake to know that the King was very well inclined to Peace, and
that him&s;elf would willingly confer with any Body He would carry him
to; and what&s;oever &s;hould be propo&s;ed, He would with all po&s;&s;ible Ex|pedition
tran&s;mit it to the King:&endq; With this farther Direction, &startq;that if
<MILESTONE N="20">He were &s;atisfied that their Intentions were real, which the Alterations in
their own Affairs made probable, He &s;hould endeavour, by the Queen or
<HI>Ruvigny,</HI> to di&s;cover whether it would not be po&s;&s;ible to per&s;uade that
King to treat apart and exclude <HI>Holland;</HI> and if it appeared to him that
was not to be hoped, that at lea&s;t his Maje&s;ty would think it rea&s;on|able,
that the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;hould re&s;tore what&s;oever Fort or other Place They
had taken upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI> and likewi&s;e pay a good Sum of
Money to the King towards the Charge of the War.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>St. Albans</HI> had no Mind to return with no larger a Com|mi&s;&s;ion,
and pretended to know &startq;that this was not the Way to advance a
<MILESTONE N="30">Treaty, and that He could as well write what the King directed, and
know again by Letter what They thought of it; and therefore He would
&s;tay and di&s;patch the Bu&s;ine&s;s which the Queen &s;ent him about, before He
would return.&endq; But when He &s;aw the King was contented He &s;hould &s;tay;
rather than have Nothing to do in the Treaty, He cho&s;e to be at the Be|ginning
of it, and thought He &s;hould not be afterwards left out; and &s;o
offered the King to depart without farther Delay.</P>
<P>THE King had from the Beginning informed the Chancellor of all that
the Earl had &s;aid to him from his Arrival: And when He had received tho&s;e
Letters from <HI>Ruvigny,</HI> He &s;ent him to &s;hew them to him; and him&s;elf came
<MILESTONE N="40">pre&s;ently whil&s;t the Earl was there, and directed him to prepare the In&s;truc|tions
for him, which the Earl likewi&s;e de&s;ired He might do. The Chan|cellor
very well knew, that his Credit with the King was much le&s;&s;ened,
and that of the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> much increa&s;ed, who did not like that He
&s;hould meddle in the Affairs proper to his Office: Be&s;ides He had no Mind
to be intru&s;ted in the Tran&s;actions with <HI>France,</HI> of who&s;e Want of Faith
He had too much Experience; which would neither be grateful to the
Queen Mother nor to the Earl. And therefore He very earne&s;tly be&s;ought
the King, &startq;that, it being the Lord <HI>Arlington's</HI> Province, all tho&s;e Di&s;|patches
might pa&s;s through his Hands.&endq; The King &s;aid, &startq;that He knew
<MILESTONE N="50">the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> de&s;ired his Help, and that He &s;hould prepare all tho&s;e
Di&s;patches,&endq; which He required him to do: And the Earl of <HI>St. Albans</HI>
&s;eemed very much to de&s;ire, &startq;that not only his In&s;tructions might be pre|pared
by him, but that He might always receive his Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure
<PB N="402" REF="408">
&s;ignified by him, upon any material Point that &s;hould ari&s;e;&endq; which the
King promi&s;ed him He &s;hould do. Upon which the other, who dur&s;t not
decline tho&s;e Commands He was &s;o unwilling to obey, humbly de&s;ired his
Maje&s;ty, &startq;that the whole Matter might be fir&s;t communicated to that Com|mittee
of the Council, with which He con&s;ulted his mo&s;t &s;ecret Affairs;
and that the Earl of <HI>St. Albans</HI> might be pre&s;ent at the Debate; and that
whatever He &s;hould be appointed to put into Writing might be peru&s;ed
at that Board, and if it required his Maje&s;ty's Signature, it &s;hould be
pre&s;ented to him by the Secretary:&endq; All which his Maje&s;ty con&s;ented to.
And all being done according to what is mentioned before,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He returns into</HI> France <HI>to negotiate a Peace.</HI></NOTE> the Earl de|parted<MILESTONE N="10">
for <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>IT is very true, there was yet no vi&s;ible Alteration in the King's Confi|dence
towards the Chancellor with Reference to his Bu&s;ine&s;s, in which his
Maje&s;ty had no Re&s;erve, and &s;pent as much Time with him, and vouch&s;afed
as often to go to his Hou&s;e, as He had ever u&s;ed to do. But when He of|fered
to &s;peak to him of other Matters, as He could not forbear to do, which
He thought concerned him more than his mo&s;t publick Tran&s;actions; He
found his Countenance pre&s;ently &s;hut, no Attention, and no An&s;wer, or
&s;uch a one as &s;hewed He was not plea&s;ed: And He took all Occa&s;ions to
make others &s;ee, that He was advi&s;ed only by him in what immediately re|lated<MILESTONE N="20">
to his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and not more in that than by other Men.</P>
<P>WHEN the Earl came to <HI>Paris,</HI> He found the <HI>French</HI> le&s;s upon their
Guard than He expected: And the King him&s;elf frankly expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf
&startq;to wi&s;h an End of this War, and that He might be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the King's
Friend&s;hip, which He valued exceedingly;&endq; and referred to <HI>Mon&s;ieur
Lionne,</HI> &startq;who&endq; his Maje&s;ty &s;aid &startq;was prepared to &s;peak to him.&endq; <HI>Mon|&s;ieur
De Lionne</HI> kept him&s;elf within Generals, &startq;of the Benefit that <HI>England</HI>
would receive by a Peace, which made his <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Maje&s;ty de&s;ire to
promote it, and never more to depart from his Friend&s;hip. That He was
obliged in Honour now not to quit the <HI>Dutch,</HI> having entered into a<MILESTONE N="30">
Treaty with them when He had no Imagination that there would be a
War between them and <HI>England;</HI> that He had been often &s;orry for it,
and had given them ju&s;t Occa&s;ion to complain, <HI>that He forbore longer
than He ought to have done to give them Help:</HI> And therefore He could
not now leave them to them&s;elves, except They were ob&s;tinate, and re|fu&s;ed
to make Peace upon ju&s;t Conditions; and then He would renounce
them.&endq; But when He found that the Earl had no Power, and that He
talked of Money to be given for the Charge of the War, and expected to have
particular Overtures to &s;end to the King; He brake off the Di&s;cour&s;e till
He could confer with his Ma&s;ter.<MILESTONE N="40"></P>
<P>WITHIN two or three Days <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Lionne</HI> vi&s;ited the Earl, and
told him, &startq;that if any Thing were to be done towards a Peace, there mu&s;t
be no Time lo&s;t: It was yet in the Power of the mo&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> King to
bring it to pa&s;s upon ju&s;t and honourable Terms; but He knew not how
long it would continue in his Power; for He confe&s;&s;ed the <HI>Dutch</HI> took
them&s;elves to be &s;o much behindhand, that They had no Mind to Peace,
believing They had now Advantage. That it was never heard of, that
after a War between two Nations, upon the making Peace, either Side
con&s;ented to pay the Charge of the War: Therefore any Expectation of
that, or but Mention of it, would &s;hut the Door again&s;t any Treaty.&endq; He<MILESTONE N="50">
gave two Papers to him to &s;end to the King, Both under his own Hand,
which his Maje&s;ty had the Choice of, and which the <HI>Dutch</HI> would con&s;ent
<PB N="403" REF="409">
to; &startq;but if that &s;hould be required, the Treaty was at an End before it was
begun, and the Sword mu&s;t determine it.&endq;</P>
<P>ONE of the Papers contained an Equivalent,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Overtures made by</HI> France.</NOTE> of which his Maje&s;ty might
make his Choice; whether &startq;all Things &s;hould continue in the State and Po&s;|ture
in which they were at pre&s;ent, either Side enjoying what They had got
and &s;u&s;taining what They had lo&s;t, and &s;o all Things to remain as they
were before the War;&endq; or, &startq;that a true and ju&s;t Computation &s;hould be
made of the Lo&s;&s;es on Both Sides, and They who were found to have re|ceived
mo&s;t Damage &s;hould be repaired at the Charge of the other.&endq;
<MILESTONE N="10">The other Paper was, &startq;that if his Maje&s;ty approved of either of the&s;e Ex|pedients,
He &s;hould him&s;elf make Choice of the Place where the Treaty
&s;hould be, whither all Parties &s;hould &s;end their Amba&s;&s;adours:&endq; But then
the <HI>French</HI> King de&s;ired, &startq;that his Maje&s;ty would not make Choice of any
Place in the King of <HI>Spain's</HI> Dominions;&endq; and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour
there had nominated <HI>Cologne</HI> or <HI>Francfort</HI> or <HI>Hamburgh.</HI> And the Earl of
<HI>St. Albans</HI> immediately &s;ent away an Expre&s;s with tho&s;e two Papers to the
King, upon Receipt whereof the Council were &s;ummoned.</P>
<P>THERE was no Hope of Money, which &s;ome, not rea&s;onably, had expected
&s;hould be paid whenever a Peace &s;hould be made; and it had been men|tioned
<MILESTONE N="20">in <HI>Holland</HI> as a Thing They expected &s;hould be propounded, it
may be, that it might be propounded and rejected. Then the Di&s;patch
of what&s;oever &s;hould be agreed concerned the King very much, that the
<HI>Dutch</HI> might not put to Sea, nor di&s;cover that the King had no Fleet to
&s;et out; for the Spring was not yet come, though approaching. There ap|peared
little Difficulty in the Choice of the Equivalent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which the King approves.</NOTE> for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had
taken much more from the <HI>Dutch</HI> than They had taken from <HI>England;</HI> and
the other Computation would be endle&s;s, and liable to very difficult Exa|minations:
So that by an unanimous Advice the King re&s;olved to choo&s;e the
fir&s;t Equivalent.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30">BUT then the Place for the Treaty was not &s;o ea&s;y to be cho&s;en.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Difficulties about &s;ettling the Place for the Treaty.</NOTE> The
mo&s;t natural had been <HI>Bru&s;&s;els, Antwerp,</HI> or &s;ome other large City in <HI>Flan|ders,</HI>
which were all neutral Places, and to which all Parties might repair
with the &s;ame Ea&s;e and Security. Whereas all the Places mentioned in <HI>Ger|many</HI>
were at &s;o great a Di&s;tance, that the Summer would be far entered
into, and &s;o, many Acts of Ho&s;tility pa&s;s, before the Amba&s;&s;adours could meet;
and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> mu&s;t pa&s;s through the Enemy's Country thither: Therefore
there could be no Thought of any of tho&s;e Places. Then the King of
<HI>France</HI> had taken upon him to exclude <HI>Flanders,</HI> which He had no Power
to do, and it was as de&s;irable to the <HI>Dutch</HI> as to the King: And therefore
<MILESTONE N="40">it was thought rea&s;onable, that the King &s;hould in&s;i&s;t upon &s;ome good Town
there, of which there was Choice enough; and if <HI>Holland</HI> &s;hould approve
it <HI>France</HI> could not reject it. But on the other Hand it was clearly di&s;|cerned,
that <HI>France</HI> would never &s;end Amba&s;&s;adours into a Country which
He meant at the &s;ame Time to invade; and that his Maje&s;ty knew very well
to be the Intention, and the Ground of that King's de&s;iring the Peace, which
it was plain enough the <HI>Dutch</HI> did not de&s;ire, and were only drawn to con|&s;ent
to a Treaty by the po&s;itive Demand of <HI>France,</HI> which They dur&s;t not
contradict: And therefore it concerned the King to pre&s;erve that good Di&s;|po&s;ition,
and that the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;adours might come fully in&s;tructed to
<MILESTONE N="50">conour with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in what &s;hould be ju&s;t, and prevent any in&s;olent
Carriage of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> or the <HI>Dans,</HI> who was likewi&s;e to have his Amba&s;|&s;adours
upon the Place.</P>
<P><PB N="404" REF="410">
UPON tho&s;e Rea&s;ons the Expre&s;s returned with his Maje&s;ty's Con&s;ent and
Election of the fir&s;t Equivalent, and &startq;that as &s;oon as He &s;hould know that
the <HI>Dutch</HI> had con&s;ented to it, his Maje&s;ty would propo&s;e &s;ome equal Place
for the Treaty.&endq; And as &s;oon as the Expre&s;s was di&s;patched, his Ma|je&s;ty
entered upon the Debate of a fit Place for the Treaty; and &s;aid,
&startq;that He had a Propo&s;ition then made to him by Sir <HI>William Coventry,</HI>
that was of &s;uch a Nature as much &s;urpri&s;ed him, as He believed it would
the Lords; yet He had not thought enough to di&s;like or condemn it:&endq;
And &s;o bade the other to propo&s;e it. He, with &s;ome &s;hort Apology which
He did not u&s;e to make, &s;aid, &startq;that He perceived there would be little le&s;s<MILESTONE N="10">
Difficulty in agreeing upon a Place for the Treaty than upon any Doubts
which might ari&s;e in it; for if the King of <HI>France</HI> was to be gratified in
the Exclu&s;ion of <HI>Flanders,</HI> it would be very inconvenient to oblige the
King to &s;end into <HI>Germany,</HI> which by the great Delay would deprive the
King of the greate&s;t Benefit He expected from the Treaty; the &s;peedy
Di&s;patch whereof would be attended with the greate&s;t Conveniences:
Therefore He had propo&s;ed to the King, <HI>that He would immediately write
to the</HI> States General <HI>without acquainting</HI> France <HI>with it, and offer to &s;end
his Amba&s;&s;adours to treat the Peace at the</HI> Hague, <HI>that it might be &s;peedily
concluded, which would otherwi&s;e take up much Time in &s;ending for any Re|&s;olution<MILESTONE N="20">
to the</HI> States <HI>upon what &s;hould ari&s;e. If They con&s;ented to it, it would
probably be attended with Succe&s;s, the general Affection of the People being
well known to de&s;ire Peace: And if They refu&s;ed it, the World would con|clude
that They would have no Peace, when They would not treat about it;
and that his Maje&s;ty would never have done them the Honour to have &s;ent
his Amba&s;&s;adours Home to them, if He had intended to deny any Thing that
was rea&s;onable to them.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>IT was very new, and thought of by Nobody but the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> and
Sir <HI>William Coventry,</HI> who had communicated it together; and the Objec|tion
of the Conde&s;cen&s;ion that it would &s;eem to mo&s;t Men, as if the King<MILESTONE N="30">
&s;ent to beg a Peace at their own Doors, was obvious to all Men: But that
would have been an Objection again&s;t admitting it to have been at <HI>Paris.</HI>
But the <HI>States</HI> not being upon any Level that pretended to an Equality, the
probable Convenience or Benefit that might attend it was only to be con&s;i|dered;
and the Affection and De&s;ire of the People generally to Peace was
&s;o notorious, that there was Rea&s;on to believe that They would not be wil|ling
that a Treaty begun among&s;t them &s;hould end but with Effect: And
therefore it was unanimou&s;ly agreed, that the Advice &s;hould be pur&s;ued.
But then it was a new Doubt, how the Me&s;&s;age or Overture or Letter,
for the Form was not yet thought of, &s;hould be conveyed; for the &s;ending<MILESTONE N="40">
a Trumpet or Expre&s;s had much more of Application than the Thing it&s;elf:
And it was to be wi&s;hed, that it might be gone out of the King's Hands
before the An&s;wer could come from <HI>Paris,</HI> le&s;t new In&s;tance &s;hould be made
for a particular Place.</P>
<P>IT was at la&s;t re&s;olved, that the <HI>Swedes</HI> Amba&s;&s;adours (both <HI>France</HI> and
<HI>Holland</HI> having accepted the Mediation of that Crown) &s;hould be con&s;ulted
with, to engage their Mini&s;ter at the <HI>Hague</HI> to deliver it to the <HI>States Ge|neral;</HI>
for there was &s;ome Apprehen&s;ion, that if <HI>De Wit</HI> knew of it, it
might be con&s;idered only by that Committee which was deputed for that
Affair, and never be brought to the <HI>States:</HI> And the adju&s;ting all that<MILESTONE N="50">
was commended to the Chancellor, who pre&s;ently &s;ent for the Amba&s;&s;a|dours,
and found them very ready to perform any Office which might
<PB N="405" REF="411">
bring them upon the Stage in the Treaty. And upon Communication to|gether,
They were willing to &s;end a Servant of their own to the <HI>Hague,</HI>
who &s;hould deliver to their Amba&s;&s;adour the King's Me&s;&s;age to the <HI>States
General,</HI> as an Effect of their Mediation and Credit with the King. And
&s;o it was delivered, not in the Form of a Letter, but of a Me&s;&s;age in the
third Per&s;on to the <HI>States General,</HI> &s;igned by the King and under the Signet;
and the Amba&s;&s;adours &s;ent a Gentleman in Po&s;t with it.</P>
<P>BUT within two Days a new Alarm comes from <HI>France;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Dutch <HI>refu&s;e to re|&s;tore</HI> Pole|roone <HI>accord|ing to the O|vertures.</HI></NOTE> and all that
was done proved to be to no Purpo&s;e. When They received the King's An|&s;wer,
<MILESTONE N="10">They could not but acknowledge that it was as fair as They could
expect; and <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Lionne</HI> &s;hewed it as &s;uch to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Amba&s;&s;a|dour,
who finding that He was &s;atisfied with it, and by him, that the
King was &s;o too, fell into much Pa&s;&s;ion, and declared &startq;that it was not
according to the Con&s;ent He had given to the King and to <HI>Mon&s;ieur
De Lionne;</HI> and that He mu&s;t prote&s;t again&s;t any Treaty to be entered
into upon this Declaration.&endq; He put him then in Mind, &startq;that He had
informed the King, in his Pre&s;ence, <HI>that there was an Article in the late
Treaty between</HI> England <HI>and</HI> Holland, <HI>by which They were obliged to deli|ver
up the I&s;land of</HI> Poleroone <HI>in the</HI> Ea&s;t-Indies <HI>to the</HI> Ea&s;t-India <HI>Company
<MILESTONE N="20">of</HI> London, <HI>which They had formerly con&s;ented to with</HI> Cromwell, <HI>but had
neither delivered it then nor yet, and were re&s;olved rather to continue the
War than to part with it;</HI> which He had declared, when with Reference
to all other Things He con&s;ented to the Alternative: And if the King
would not relea&s;e that Article of the former Treaty, his Ma&s;ters would
not enter upon any new.&endq;</P>
<P>WHETHER this was true or no cannot be known. But <HI>Mon&s;ieur De
Lionne</HI> came in great Di&s;order to the Lord of <HI>St. Albans,</HI> and told him all
that the Amba&s;&s;adour had &s;aid, and confe&s;&s;ed it &startq;to be very true, and that
the King remembered it well, and promi&s;ed that Article &s;hould be re|lea&s;ed:
<MILESTONE N="30">But that He, not clearly under&s;tanding the Delivery of it to be
contained in a former Treaty, and knowing it had been many Years in
the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and that it &s;till remained &s;o, thought it had
been comprehended in the Alternative, and forgat to in&s;ert it in the
Paper that was &s;ent to the King, for which He a&s;ked a thou&s;and Pardons;
and made it his Suit to the King that He would yield to it, and that a
Treaty that was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the Good of <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> might not be
extingui&s;hed upon his Negligence and Want of Memory;&endq; which was a
&s;trange Excu&s;e for a Mini&s;ter of his known Sagacity.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>St. Albans</HI> refu&s;ed to tran&s;mit any &s;uch Tergiver&s;ation to the
<MILESTONE N="40">King, and &s;aid, &startq;He knew the King would never con&s;ent to it; and that
this Manner of Proceeding, after that his Maje&s;ty had con&s;ented to what
them&s;elves propo&s;ed, would &s;hut out all future Confidence of their Sin|cerity.&endq;
<HI>Mon&s;ieur De Lionne</HI> was exceedingly troubled and out of Coun|tenance,
as a Man con&s;cious to him&s;elf of a great Over&s;ight, and de&s;ired him, &startq;
that He would meet the <HI>Dutch</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour at his Lodging, that They
might together endeavour to remove him from the Ob&s;tinacy He pro|fe&s;&s;ed;&endq;
which the Earl was contented to do, and the Amba&s;&s;adour, how
unwillingly &s;oever, was prevailed with to meet at the Time appointed: But
They were no &s;ooner met, and <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Lionne</HI> entered upon the Argu|ment
<MILESTONE N="50">of <HI>Poleroone,</HI> but the Amba&s;&s;adour fell into a rude Pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;aid,&startq;
the War &s;hould determine it.&endq; And when the Earl of <HI>St. Albans</HI> began
to &s;peak of the Unrea&s;onablene&s;s of the Demand, and entered upon the &s;oul
Manner in which They had fir&s;t taken that I&s;land from the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who
<PB N="406" REF="412">
were in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; He told him, &startq;that He had Nothing to &s;ay to
him,&endq; and u&s;ed much other Language unfit for the other to hear, and
which He had returned with Intere&s;t, if <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Lionne</HI> had not inter|po&s;ed,
and been very de&s;irous the Conference &s;hould end, the Amba&s;&s;adour's
In&s;olence being not to be endured: And &s;o They parted, <HI>Lionne</HI> &s;eeming
very much offended; and He complained to the King, and the Earl gave
the Account of all to his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>THE <HI>French</HI> King was no le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed and offended when He heard what
Me&s;&s;age the King had &s;ent to the <HI>States</HI> (which He was adverti&s;ed of by an
Expre&s;s from <HI>Holland),</HI> than <HI>De Wit</HI> had been at the Delivery of it, who<MILESTONE N="10">
pre&s;ently knew the Dri&s;t of it, and could not forbear to tell the <HI>States,</HI>
&startq;that the De&s;ign was only to &s;tir up the People again&s;t the Magi&s;trates,
and indeed to make them the Judges of the Conditions of the Peace:&endq;
And He knew well that the People generally were no Friends to the <HI>Ea&s;t|India</HI>
Company (where him&s;elf had a great Stock), and therefore would ne|ver
con&s;ent that a Treaty entered into &s;hould break only upon their Intere&s;t;
which likewi&s;e was the Rea&s;on, why They had provided that that Particu|lar
&s;hould be fir&s;t con&s;ented to, before any Treaty &s;hould be agreed upon.
And hereupon He prevailed upon the <HI>States General</HI> forthwith to declare in
the Negative, &startq;that the Treaty &s;hould not be at the <HI>Hague.</HI>&endq; But at the<MILESTONE N="20">
&s;ame Time, after the naming again of <HI>Cologne</HI> and <HI>Francfort,</HI> They added,&startq;
that if the King de&s;ired to do them the Honour to appoint it in any Place
of their Dominions, which They did not pre&s;ume to propo&s;e; They &s;hould
con&s;ent that it might be at <HI>Breda,</HI> or <HI>Mae&s;tricht,</HI>&endq; or a Place or two that
They named: And this was re&s;olved before the People heard that the King
had named the <HI>Hague,</HI> and wondered and murmured at their Refu&s;al.</P>
<P>THE King of <HI>France</HI> took it ill, that at a Time when He proceeded with
&s;o much Openne&s;s, and had given the fir&s;t Ri&s;e to a Treaty, and opened
the Door which the <HI>Hollander</HI> peevi&s;hly &s;hut again&s;t it, by his own offer|ing
the Alternative, which the King had &s;o far approved as to make his<MILESTONE N="30">
Election; He &s;hould at the &s;ame Time, without communicating it to him,
&s;end this Overture to the <HI>Hague:</HI> Which troubled him the more, that it
gave him Matter of Jealou&s;y to apprehend, that there was &s;ome other un|derhand
Treaty that was concealed from him, and contrived by the Baron
of <HI>I&s;ola,</HI> who He knew had been privately at the <HI>Hague</HI> and had Con|ference
with <HI>De Wit.</HI> And the &s;ame Imagination did more perplex the
Queen Mother and the Earl of <HI>St. Albans,</HI> who looked upon this as a De|vice
to exclude them from having any Share in the Peace; the Earl having
dige&s;ted the Conclu&s;ion in his own Brea&s;t, that in what Place &s;oever the
Treaty &s;hould be held, He &s;hould without Doubt be intru&s;ted in the Ma|nagery<MILESTONE N="40">
of it. However the King could not own his Part of the Di&s;like,
&s;ince his Maje&s;ty might without any Violation of Friend&s;hip make the Over|ture
by Me&s;&s;age to the <HI>Hague,</HI> as well as to or by him: Therefore He
&s;eemed to take no Exception to it, and only &s;ent the King Word, &startq;that He
believed the <HI>Dutch</HI> would quickly di&s;cern, that this Conde&s;cen&s;ion in his
Maje&s;ty proceeded from &s;ome Expectation of a Party among&s;t the People
to &s;econd it; and therefore He was confident They would never con&s;ent
to treat at the <HI>Hague.</HI>&endq; But He propo&s;ed, &startq;as the be&s;t Way for Expe|dition,
that it might be at <HI>Dover,</HI>&endq; which He advi&s;ed his Maje&s;ty not to
reject: &startq;For if it were once begun there, it might po&s;&s;ibly, and He would<MILESTONE N="50">
further it all He could, quickly be removed to <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and probably
might be concluded in <HI>London.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="407" REF="413">
BUT before this Me&s;&s;age arrived, the other new Demand of <HI>Poleroone,</HI>
with <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Lionne's</HI> Acknowledgement of the Defect of his Memory,
and that He ought to have in&s;erted it in the Paper that contained the
Alternative, with all the Excu&s;es He made for it, was received; which
&s;eemed to put an End to all Hopes of Peace.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King high|ly offend$$.</NOTE> The King was highly in|cen&s;ed,
and looked upon it as an Affront contrived by Both Parties to amu&s;e
him. Every Body concluded, that there could be no Safety in depending
upon any Thing that could be offered from <HI>France,</HI> when They could never
be without as rea&s;onable a Pretence as They had at pre&s;ent, to di&s;claim or
<MILESTONE N="10">avoid any Conce&s;&s;ion They had made in Writing. That the Particular de|manded
could never be con&s;ented to by his Maje&s;ty, without &s;werving from
the common Rules of Ju&s;tice, and the Violation of his own Honour. That
though it did not immediately concern his Maje&s;ty in his own Intere&s;t and
the Intere&s;t of the Crown, which was an Argument u&s;ed in <HI>France</HI> for his
Maje&s;ty's not in&s;i&s;ting upon it, it was however an unque&s;tionable and a very
con&s;iderable Intere&s;t of his Subjects, which He was in Ju&s;tice bound to
maintain, and which in Ju&s;tice He had no Power to relea&s;e. It was an In|tere&s;t
&s;o valuable, that <HI>Cromwell</HI> had in&s;i&s;ted upon it &s;o re&s;olutely, that
They had con&s;ented to it as a principal Article of the Peace He made with
<MILESTONE N="20">them; by which He gained great Reputation with the People. And
his Maje&s;ty had thought him&s;elf &s;o much concerned in Honour not to &s;uffer
his Subjects to be deprived of that Right which <HI>Cromwell</HI> had vindicated
(though by his Death it came not to be executed), that He would never con|&s;ent
to the Treaty that had been concluded &s;ince his happy Return, until
They con&s;ented to and renewed the &s;ame Article, and promi&s;ed the Rede|livery
of the &s;aid I&s;land to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> by &s;uch a Day: And their having
broken their Faith in not delivering it according to the la&s;t Treaty, and with
very offen&s;ive Circum&s;tances, his Maje&s;ty had declared to be a principal
Cau&s;e of the War, and made them unque&s;tionably to appear the fir&s;t Ag|gre&s;&s;or.
<MILESTONE N="30">And in that Re&s;pect, his Honour could not receive a more mor|tal
Wound than in relea&s;ing that Article, which concerned the E&s;tates of
other Men, and would in the Opinion of the World draw the Guilt of the
War upon him&s;elf, or, which would be as bad, the Reproach of having
purcha&s;ed a Peace upon very di&s;honourable Conditions to him&s;elf, at the
Charge and with the E&s;tates of his Subjects.</P>
<P>UPON the Whole,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And re&s;olves to continue the War.</NOTE> the King re&s;olved rather to undergo the Hazard of the
War upon what Di&s;advantage &s;oever, than to con&s;ent to a Propo&s;ition &s;o
di&s;honourable: And a Di&s;patch was pre&s;ently &s;ent to the Earl of <HI>St. Albans,</HI>
with a very lively Re&s;entment &startq;of the Indignity offered to the King, in
<MILESTONE N="40">receding from what was offered by them&s;elves, and in a&s;king what He was
re&s;olved never to grant.&endq; And all were enjoined to review all that had
been re&s;olved for the War, and to give the utmo&s;t Advancement to it that
was po&s;&s;ible: And without Doubt, if <HI>Spain</HI> had yet put it&s;elf into any Po&s;|ture
to defend it&s;elf again&s;t the Power that was even ready to invade it, and
to act any Part towards the Support of a common Intere&s;t; the King would
hardly have been per&s;uaded to have hearkened more to any Propo&s;itions
from <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all this, new Overtures and new Importunities were
&s;ent from <HI>France.</HI> &startq;It was true,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>New Over|tur$$ from</HI> France</NOTE> that the <HI>Dutch</HI> had always prote&s;ted
<MILESTONE N="50">again&s;t making a Peace or con&s;enting to a Treaty without the Relea&s;e
of <HI>Poleroone;</HI> which his <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Maje&s;ty had con&s;ented to, and could
not recede from it without their Con&s;ent, though the Mention of it had
been unfortunately omitted by <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Lionne:</HI> But his Maje&s;ty pro|mi&s;ed
<PB N="408" REF="414">
and engaged his Royal Word, that when the Treaty &s;hould be en|tered
into, He would u&s;e all his Credit and Authority to per&s;uade the
<HI>States General</HI> to recede from their Ob&s;tinacy, and to make no Alteration in
the la&s;t Treaty; but that all Things &s;hould remain as had been &s;ettled by it.
And if He could not prevail with them to &s;atisfy him therein, as He did
fear that there was upon their particular Intere&s;t &s;ome peremptory Re&s;olu|tion
fixed, from whence They would not be removed as to the Main; yet
in that Ca&s;e He did in no Degree de&s;pair of obliging them to give a con|&s;iderable
Sum of Money for Recompen&s;e thereof, which He de&s;ired might
&s;atisfy the King, who would find him&s;elf at much Ea&s;e by it. And if<MILESTONE N="10">
the Commi&s;&s;ioners once met and the Treaty was begun, it would not be
di&s;&s;olved before a Peace &s;hould be concluded; and that the <HI>French</HI> Am|ba&s;&s;adours,
as &s;oon as They met, &s;hould propo&s;e a Ce&s;&s;ation from all Acts
of Ho&s;tility, which He expected &s;hould be as &s;oon yielded to as propo&s;ed;
and that already They had promi&s;ed <HI>that their Fleet &s;hould remain in their
Harbours till the Middle of</HI> May, before which Time the Treaty might
well begin.&endq; And from the pre&s;ent Time the <HI>French</HI> King promi&s;ed,
that no ho&s;tile Act &s;hould be done by him, and that his own Fleet &s;hould
not &s;tir out of their Port; and that his Amba&s;&s;adours &s;hould in all
Things behave them&s;elves as his Maje&s;ty could wi&s;h, that Particular only<MILESTONE N="20">
of <HI>Poleroone</HI> excepted, in which They &s;hould do as He had promi&s;ed.&endq;</P>
<P>THE King had by this Time had Recour&s;e to all the Inventions and De|vices,
which might yet enable him to &s;et out a Fleet that might be able to
fight the Enemy; but in vain. He found all Men of the &s;ame Opinion
They had been, that He mu&s;t be upon the Defen&s;ive in the Manner ex|pre&s;&s;ed
before, and expect the End of the Summer before He could draw
his Ships together; and that there was an univer&s;al Impatience for Peace:
So that when the Warmth of his Indignation was a little remitted, He was
very willing to hear any Thing that might revive the Hope of a Treaty,
when this la&s;t Overture from <HI>Paris</HI> arrived; upon which He pre&s;ently con|vened<MILESTONE N="30">
the Council, that He might take a &s;peedy Re&s;olution what He was
to do, for He &s;aw many Conveniences might be lo&s;t by the not &s;peedily en|tering
upon the Treaty, if it were to be entered upon at all. The Prote&s;|tation
and Promi&s;e of <HI>France</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t in all Things, that Particular only ex|cepted,
for his Maje&s;ty's Service, and his Promi&s;e even in that, made him
willing to believe that they might be real: The Hope of Recompen&s;e for
it &s;eemed little inferiour to the Redelivery of the I&s;land, and was an equal
Satisfaction to his Maje&s;ty's Honour. And it &s;eemed the more probable to
be compa&s;&s;ed, in that <HI>De Wit</HI> in his private Conference with the Baron of
<HI>I&s;ola,</HI> in all his Pa&s;&s;ion in which He would not endure the Mention of the<MILESTONE N="40">
Delivery of <HI>Poleroone,</HI> and &s;aid, &startq;that the <HI>States</HI> would peri&s;h before They
would part with it,&endq; concluded, &startq;that He would not &s;ay that They might
not be per&s;uaded to give &s;ome Recompen&s;e for it.&endq;</P>
<P>AND many believed that the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, which was only con|cerned
in the Intere&s;t of it, would choo&s;e rather to receive a good Recom|pen&s;e
than the I&s;land it&s;elf, which was a barren, &s;andy Soil, which yielded
no Fruit, but only Nutmegs, which was the &s;ole Commodity it bore, and
is a Commodity of great Value. But when They were bound to give it up
to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> there had been immediate Order &s;ent to cut down all the
Trees upon the I&s;land; which Order would be now again repeated: And<MILESTONE N="50">
&s;o no le&s;s than &s;even Years mu&s;t expire before any Fruit could be expected
from thence. And it was &s;o far from any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factory, and &s;o near to
the <HI>Dutch,</HI> that They would ea&s;ily po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of it again when They
<PB N="409" REF="415">
had a Mind to it. And therefore if the Company might have Money, or
&s;uch a Quantity of Nutmegs delivered to them, as might, be&s;ides being
enough for the Expen&s;e of <HI>England,</HI> bear a Part in the foreign Trade (which
had been mentioned by &s;ome Merchants of that Company), it might be rea|&s;onably
preferable to the I&s;land.</P>
<P>WHATSOEVER Re&s;olution &s;hould in the End be taken, this Expedient of
Recompen&s;e gave a Hint to a Coun&s;el that had not been yet thought of,
which was to leave the Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Poleroone</HI> to the &s;ole Managery of the
<HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, who &s;hould be advi&s;ed to choo&s;e &s;ome Members of
<MILESTONE N="10">their own, who &s;hould go over with the Amba&s;&s;adours, and receive all Ad|vice
and A&s;&s;i&s;tance from them in the Conduct of their Pretence$: And They
would be the Witne&s;&s;es of what the King in&s;i&s;ted upon on their Behalf; and
would likewi&s;e judge, if Nothing prevented the Peace but that Intere&s;t, how
far it &s;hould be in&s;i&s;ted on.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company was &s;ent for,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Ea&s;t In|dia <HI>Company con&s;ulted in Relation to</HI> Poleroone</NOTE> and were told &startq;that the King
had Hope of a Treaty for Peace, which He pre&s;umed would be welcome
to them: He heard that the greate&s;t Difficulty and Ob&s;truction that was
like to ari&s;e would be concerning their Intere&s;t in the I&s;land of <HI>Poleroone,</HI>
which He was re&s;olved never to abandon. But becau&s;e He heard likewi&s;e
<MILESTONE N="20">that the <HI>Dutch</HI> did intend to offer a Recompen&s;e rather than to re&s;tore
the Place, and that the Recompen&s;e might be &s;uch as might be as agreeable
to them (of which He would not take upon him to judge, but leave it
entirely to them&s;elves), He had given them this timely Notice of it, that
They might bethink them&s;elves what was fit for them to do, upon a Pro&s;|pect
of all that might probably occur; and that They might make Choice
of &s;uch Per&s;ons among&s;t them&s;elves, who be&s;t under&s;tood their Affairs, to
the End that when the Treaty &s;hould be agreed upon and the Place ap|pointed,
and his Maje&s;ty had re&s;olved what Amba&s;&s;adours He would &s;end
(of all which They &s;hould have &s;ea&s;onable Notice), tho&s;e Per&s;ons elected
<MILESTONE N="30">by them as their Commi&s;&s;ioners might go over with the Amba&s;&s;adours;
that when that Point came into Debate, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;hould call &s;ome
of their <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company to inform them, They likewi&s;e might be
ready to adverti&s;e his Amba&s;&s;adours of what&s;oever might advance their
Pretences: And if a Recompen&s;e was to be con&s;idered, They might enter
into that Con&s;ultation with the other Deputies; and that They &s;hould be
&s;ure to receive all the Advice and A&s;&s;i&s;tance from his Amba&s;&s;adours, that
They could require or &s;tand in Need of.&endq; The Company received this
Information from his Maje&s;ty with all Demon&s;tration of Duty and Submi&s;|&s;ion,
giving humble Thanks for his Maje&s;ty's Bounty and Care of their
<MILESTONE N="40">Intere&s;t; and &s;aid, &startq;They would not fail to make Choice of a Commit|tee
to attend the Amba&s;&s;adours, when They &s;hould know it would be
&s;ea&s;onable.&endq;</P>
<P>THE King thought it now Time to receive the Advice of his whole Coun|cil-Board
upon this Affair,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King con|&s;ults the Privy Council upon the Overtures made by</HI> France.</NOTE> which had been hitherto only debated before the
Committee for foreign Affairs: And &s;o They being a&s;&s;embled, an Account
was given of all that had pa&s;&s;ed, with all its Circum&s;tances, in <HI>France,</HI>
and in <HI>Holland</HI> by the Baron of <HI>I&s;ola</HI> and by the <HI>Swedes</HI> Amba&s;&s;adours. And
his Maje&s;ty &s;aid thereupon, &startq;that He had yet taken no Re&s;olution, and had
been &s;o provoked by the Mi&s;carriage of <HI>France,</HI> that He would have been
<MILESTONE N="50">glad to have put him&s;elf into a better Po&s;ture, and not thought farther of
a Treaty, till there &s;hould appear a more favourable Conjuncture: But
They now under&s;tood as much as He did with Reference to the State
<PB N="410" REF="416">
He was in both at Home and abroad, and that He was re&s;olved to follow
their Advice.&endq;</P>
<P>ALL the Objections which had been fore&s;een before,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which advi&s;es him to enter upon the Treaty.</NOTE> and the Con&s;idera|tions
thereupon, were renewed and again debated: And in the End there
was a general Concurrence, &startq;that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould embrace the Oppor|tunity
of a Treaty; and if a rea&s;onable Peace could be obtained, it would
be very grateful to the whole Kingdom, that was weary of the War;
and that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould lo&s;e no Time in returning &s;uch a Di&s;patch to
<HI>Paris,</HI> as might bring on the Treaty.&endq; And &s;ome of the Lords pro|ceeded
&s;o far as to declare, &startq;that the Con&s;ideration of <HI>Poleroone</HI> was not of<MILESTONE N="10">
that Importance, nor could be thought &s;o by the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company
them&s;elves, as that the in&s;i&s;ting upon it &s;hould deprive the Kingdom of
a Peace that was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for it.&endq; But the King thought the entering
upon that Argument was not yet &s;ea&s;onable: But He gave Order for the
Di&s;patch to be prepared for <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>THERE were two material Points not yet determined, the fir&s;t of which
was fit to be in&s;erted into the pre&s;ent Di&s;patch; which was the Nomination
of the Place where the Treaty &s;hould be. Some were of Opinion, &startq;that
his Maje&s;ty &s;hould lay Hold of the Overture that had been made from
<HI>France,</HI> which was &s;ince likewi&s;e confirmed by <HI>Holland, that the Treaty<MILESTONE N="20">
&s;hould be at</HI> Dover:&endq; But They changed their Minds, when They well
con&s;idered that the &s;ame Objections would be naturally made again&s;t <HI>Dover</HI>
on the King's Behalf, that had been made by the <HI>Dutch</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Hague;</HI>
and that the People there, and le&s;s at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> were not incapable of any
Impre&s;&s;ions, which the numerous Trains of the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> would
be ready to imprint in them. In a Word; there was much more fit to be
con&s;idered upon that Point, than is fit to be remembered. The Conclu&s;ion
was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Breda <HI>agreed to be the Place of treating.</HI></NOTE> &startq;that <HI>Breda,</HI> which had been offered by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> &s;hould be the
Place the King would accept;&endq; which was added to the Di&s;patch for
<HI>Paris,</HI> and pre&s;ently &s;ent away.<MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>THE other Matter undetermined of was the Choice of Amba&s;&s;adours,
which had been never entered upon. The King had &s;poken with the Chan|cellor,
what Per&s;ons would be fit to be employed in that Negotiation, when
the Time &s;hould be ripe for it; and took Notice, as He did frequently, of
the &s;mall Choice He had of Men well acquainted with Bu&s;ine&s;s of that
Nature: Upon which He had named to the King the Lord <HI>Hollis,</HI> who had
been lately Amba&s;&s;adour in <HI>France,</HI> and was in all Re&s;pects equal to any
Bu&s;ine&s;s, and Mr. <HI>Henry Coventry</HI> of his Bedchamber, who had &s;hewed &s;o
great Abilities in his late Negotiation in <HI>Sweden.</HI> Upon the naming of whom
his Maje&s;ty &s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lord</HI> Hollis <HI>and Mr.</HI> Hen|ry Coventry <HI>appointed Ple|nipotentiaries.</HI></NOTE> &startq;They were Both very fit, and that He would think of<MILESTONE N="40">
no other:&endq; So that when all other Particulars were adju&s;ted with Refe|rence
to the Treaty, the King, without farther con&s;ulting it, declared,
&startq;that He intended to &s;end tho&s;e two his Amba&s;&s;adours for the Treaty,&endq;
before either of them knew or thought of the Employment. And when his
Maje&s;ty told them of it, He bade them repair to the Chancellor for their
In&s;tructions. And this gave new Thoughts of Heart to the Lord <HI>Arling|ton,</HI>
who had de&s;igned him&s;elf and Sir <HI>Thomas Clifford,</HI> who was newly
made a Privy Coun&s;ellor and Controller of the Hou&s;hold upon the Death
of Sir <HI>Hugh Pollard,</HI> for the Performance of that Service; and thought him|&s;elf
the better qualified for it by his late Alliance in <HI>Holland,</HI> by his Mar|riage<MILESTONE N="50">
with the Daughter of <HI>Mon&s;ieur Beverwaert,</HI> a natural Son of Prince
<HI>Maurice.</HI> And this Di&s;appointment went very near him; though the other
had not the lea&s;t Thought that He had any &s;uch Thing in his Heart, but
<PB N="411" REF="417">
advi&s;ed it purely as They were the fitte&s;t Per&s;ons who could be thought of;
and their Abilities, which were well thought of before, were very notorious
in this Negotiation.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;adours,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Swedi&s;h <HI>Amba&s;&s;adours Mediators.</HI></NOTE> who were the only Mediators, prepared
likewi&s;e to go to the Treaty, having agreed with the King, &startq;that if the
Treaty &s;hould not produce a Peace,&endq; of which They who hoped mo&s;t
were not confident, &startq;that Crown would immediately declare for the King,
and unite it&s;elf to his Intere&s;t both again&s;t the <HI>Dutch</HI> and the <HI>French;</HI>&endq;
their Army at that Time, being held the be&s;t in <HI>Europe,</HI> under the Com|mand
<MILESTONE N="10">of their General <HI>Wrangel,</HI> being near the <HI>States</HI> Dominions. And
for the better confirming them in that Di&s;po&s;ition, the Chancellor had
brought the Baron of <HI>I&s;ola</HI> to a Conference with the <HI>Swedes</HI> Amba&s;&s;adours,
and begun that Treaty between them which was &s;hortly after fini&s;hed, and
known by the Style of the <HI>Triple Alliance,</HI> that was the fir&s;t Act that de|tached
the <HI>Swede</HI> from <HI>France:</HI> And for the pre&s;ent the King him&s;elf found
Means to &s;upply the Crown of <HI>Sweden</HI> with a Sum of Money for the Sup|port
of their Army.</P>
<P>ALL Things being thus adju&s;ted, and the Place of the Treaty being on
all Hands agreed to be <HI>Breda,</HI> and Notice being &s;ent from <HI>Paris,</HI> &startq;that their
<MILESTONE N="20">Amba&s;&s;adours were departed from thence;&endq; the King thought him&s;elf as
much concerned in the Expedition in Re&s;pect of the Ce&s;&s;ation, which the <HI>French</HI>
promi&s;ed to obtain in the very Entrance into the Treaty; and it was now the
Month of <HI>May.</HI> And &s;o his Amba&s;&s;adours were di&s;patched, and arrived
there before the Middle of that Month, with an Equipage worthy their Ma&s;|ter
who &s;ent them.</P>
<P>THERE happened at this Time an Accident that made a fatal Breach into
the Chancellor's Fortune,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Death of the Earl of</HI> Southampton.</NOTE> with a Gap wide enough to let in all that Ruin
which &s;oon after was poured upon him. The Earl of <HI>Southampton,</HI> the Trea|&s;urer,
with whom He had an entire fa&s;t Friend&s;hip, and who, when They
<MILESTONE N="30">were together, had Credit enough with the King and at the Board to pre|vent,
at lea&s;t to defer, any very unrea&s;onable Re&s;olution, was now ready
to expire with the Stone; a Di&s;ea&s;e that had kept him in great Pain many
Months, and for which He had &s;ent to <HI>Paris</HI> for a Surgeon to be cut, but
had deferred it too long by the Phy&s;icians not agreeing what the Di&s;ea&s;e
was: So that at la&s;t He grew too weak to apply that Remedy. They who
had with &s;o much Indu&s;try, and as They thought Certainty, prevailed with
the King at <HI>Oxford</HI> to have removed him from that Office, had never &s;ince
intermitted the pur&s;uing the De&s;ign, and per&s;uaded his Maje&s;ty, &startq;that his
Service had &s;uffered exceedingly by his receding from his Purpo&s;e;&endq; and
<MILESTONE N="40">did not think their Triumph notorious enough, if They &s;uffered him to die
in the Office: In&s;omuch as when He grew &s;o weak that it is true He could
not &s;ign any Orders with his Hand, which was four or five Days before his
Death, They had again per&s;uaded the King to &s;end for the Staff. But the
Chancellor again prevailed with him not to do &s;o ungracious an Act to a
Servant who had &s;erved him and his Father &s;o long and &s;o eminently, to &s;o
little Purpo&s;e as the ravi&s;hing an Office un&s;ea&s;onably, which mu&s;t within
five or fix Days fall into his Hands; as it did within le&s;s Time by his
Death.</P>
<P>HE was a Per&s;on of extraordinary Parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Character.</NOTE> of Faculties very di&s;cerning and
<MILESTONE N="50">Judgment very profound, great Eloquence in his Delivery, without the
lea&s;t Affectation of Words, for He always &s;pake be&s;t on the &s;udden. In
the Beginning of the Troubles, He was looked upon among&s;t tho&s;e Lords
who were lea&s;t inclined to the Court, and &s;o mo&s;t acceptable to the Peo|ple:
<PB N="412" REF="418">
He was in Truth not obliged by the Court, and thought him&s;elf op|pre&s;&s;ed
by it, which his great Spirit could not bear; and &s;o He had for
&s;ome Years forbore to be much &s;een there, which was imputed to a Habit
of Melancholy, to which He was naturally inclined, though it appeared
more in his Countenance than in his Conver&s;ation, which to tho&s;e with
whom He was acquainted was very cheerful.</P>
<P>THE great Friend&s;hip that had been between their Fathers made many
believe, that there was a Confidence between the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and him;
which was true to that Degree as could be between Men of &s;o different Na|tures
and Under&s;tandings. And when They came to the Parliament in the<MILESTONE N="10">
Year 1640, They appeared Both un&s;atisfied with the Prudence and Politicks
of the Court, and were not re&s;erved in declaring it, when the great Offi|cers
were called in Que&s;tion for great Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions in their &s;everal Admi|ni&s;trations:
But in the Pro&s;ecution there was great Difference in their Pa&s;|&s;ions
and their Ends. The Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was a great Lover of Ju&s;tice, and
could not have been tempted to con&s;ent to the Oppre&s;&s;ion of an innocent
Man: But in the di&s;cerning the &s;everal Species of Guilt, and in the propor|tioning
the Degrees of Puni&s;hment to the Degree of Guilt, He had no Fa|culties
or Mea&s;ure of judging; nor was above the Temptation of general Pre|judice,
and it may be of particular Di&s;obligations and Re&s;entments, which<MILESTONE N="20">
proceeded from the Weakne&s;s of his Judgment, not the Malice of his Na|ture.
The Earl of <HI>Southampton</HI> was not only an exact Ob&s;erver of Ju&s;tice,
but &s;o clear&s;ighted a Di&s;cerner of all the Circum&s;tances which might di&s;|gui&s;e
it, that no fal&s;e or fraudulent Colour could impo&s;e upon him; and of
&s;o &s;incere and impartial a Judgment, that no Prejudice to the Per&s;on of any
Man made him le&s;s awake to his Cau&s;e; but believed that there is <HI>aliquid
et in Ho&s;tem Nefas,</HI> and that a very ill Man might be very unju&s;tly
dealt with.</P>
<P>THIS Difference of Faculties divided them quickly in the Progre&s;s of tho&s;e
Bu&s;ine&s;&s;es, in the Beginning whereof They were Both of one Mind. They<MILESTONE N="30">
Both thought the Crown had committed great Exce&s;&s;es in the Exerci&s;e of
its Power, which the one thought could not be otherwi&s;e prevented, than by
its being deprived of it: The Con&s;equence whereof the other too well un|der&s;tood,
and that the ab&s;olute taking away that Power that might do Hurt,
would likewi&s;e take away &s;ome of that which was nece&s;&s;ary for the doing
Good; and that a Monarch cannot be deprived of a fundamental Right,
without &s;uch a la&s;ting Wound to Monarchy it&s;elf, that They who have mo&s;t
Shelter from it and &s;tand neare&s;t to it, the Nobility, could not continue long
in their native Strength, if the Crown received a Maim. Which if the Earl
of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> had comprehended, who &s;et as great a Price upon Nobility as any<MILESTONE N="40">
Man living did, He could never have been wrought upon to have contri|buted
to his own Undoing; which the other knew was unavoidable, if the
King were undone. So They were Both &s;atisfied that the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI>
had countenanced &s;ome high Proceedings, which could not be &s;upported by
any Rules of Ju&s;tice, though the Policy of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the con&s;tant Cour&s;e
ob&s;erved in the Government of that Kingdom, might have excu&s;ed and ju&s;|tified
many of the high Proceedings with which He was reproached: And
They who had now the Advantage-Ground, by being thought to be mo&s;t
&s;olicitous for the Liberty of the Subject, and mo&s;t vigilant that the &s;ame
Outrages might not be tran&s;planted out of the other Kingdom into this,<MILESTONE N="50">
looked upon him as having the &s;tronge&s;t Influence upon the Coun&s;els of
<HI>England</HI> as well as Governour of <HI>Ireland.</HI> Then He had declared him&s;elf
&s;o aver&s;e and irreconcilable to the Sedition and Rebellion of the <HI>Scots,</HI> that
<PB N="413" REF="419">
the whole Nation had contracted &s;o great an Animo&s;ity again&s;t him, that
le&s;s than his Life could not &s;ecure them from the Fears They had conceived
of him: And this Fury of theirs met with a full Concurrence from tho&s;e of
the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who could not compa&s;s their own Ends without their Help.
And this Combination too &s;oon drew the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> who had none of
their Ends, into their Party, to &s;atisfy his Pride and his Pa&s;&s;ion, in removing
a Man who &s;eemed to have no Regard for him; for the Stories, which were
then made of Di&s;obligations from the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> towards the Earl of
<HI>Clanrickard,</HI> were without any Foundation of Truth.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10">THE Earl of <HI>Southampton,</HI> who had Nothing of Obligation, and Some|what
of Prejudice to &s;ome high Acts of Power which had been exerci&s;ed by
the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> was not unwilling that they &s;hould be &s;o far looked
into and examined, as might rai&s;e more Caution and Apprehen&s;ion in Men
of great Authority of the Con&s;equence of &s;uch Exce&s;&s;es. But when He di&s;|cerned
irregular Ways entered into to puni&s;h tho&s;e Irregularities, and which
might be attended with as ill Con&s;equences, and that They intended to
compound one great Crime out of &s;everal &s;maller Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, and, to u&s;e
their own Style, <HI>to complicate a Trea&s;on out of Mi&s;demeanors,</HI> and &s;o to take
away his Life for what He might be fined and impri&s;oned; He fir&s;t di&s;&s;uaded
<MILESTONE N="20">and then abhorred that Exorbitance, and more abhorred it, when He found
it pa&s;&s;ionately and maliciou&s;ly re&s;olved by a direct Combination.</P>
<P>FROM this Time He and the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> were perfectly divided and &s;e|parated,
and &s;eldom afterwards concurred in the &s;ame Opinion: But as He
worthily and bravely &s;tood in the Gap in the Defence of that great Man's
Life, &s;o He did afterwards oppo&s;e all tho&s;e Inva&s;ions, which were every
Day made by the Hou&s;e of Commons upon the Rights of the Crown, or
the Privileges of the Peers, which the Lords were willing to &s;acrifice to the
u&s;eful Humour of the other. And by this Means, whil&s;t mo&s;t of the
King's Servants li&s;ted them&s;elves with the Con&s;pirators in promoting all
<MILESTONE N="30">Things which were ingrateful to him, this Lord, who had no Relation to
his Service, was looked upon as a Courtier; and by the Strength of his Rea|&s;on
gave &s;uch a Check to their Proceedings, that He became little le&s;s odious
to them than the Court it&s;elf; and &s;o much the more odious, becau&s;e as
He was &s;uperiour to their Temptations, &s;o his unque&s;tionable Integrity was
out of their Reach, and made him contemn their Power as much as their
Malice.</P>
<P>HE had all the Dete&s;tation imaginable of the civil War, and di&s;cerned
the di&s;mal Effects it would produce, more than mo&s;t other Men, which
made him do all He could to prevent it. But when it could not be avoided,
<MILESTONE N="40">He made no Scruple how to di&s;po&s;e of him&s;elf, but frankly declared for
the King, who had a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of the Service He had done him, and made
him then both of his Privy Council and Gentleman of his Bedchamber,
without the lea&s;t Application or De&s;ire of his, and when mo&s;t of tho&s;e who
were under Both tho&s;e Relations had cho&s;en, as the much &s;tronger, the Re|bels
Side: And his receiving tho&s;e Obligations at that pre&s;ent was known
to proceed more from his Duty than his Ambition. He had all the Fidelity
that God requires, and all the Affection to the Per&s;on of the King that his
Duty &s;ugge&s;ted to him was due, without any Reverence for or Compliance
with his Infirmities or Weakne&s;s; which made him many Times unea&s;y to
<MILESTONE N="50">the King, e&s;pecially in all Con&s;ultations towards Peace, in which He was
always de&s;irous that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould yield more than He was inclined
to do.</P>
<P><PB N="414" REF="420">
HE was in his Nature melancholick, and re&s;erved in his Conver&s;ation,
except towards tho&s;e with whom He was very well acquainted; with whom
He was not only cheerful, but upon Occa&s;ion light and plea&s;ant. He was
naturally lazy, and indulged overmuch Ea&s;e to him&s;elf: Yet as no Man
had a quicker Apprehen&s;ion or &s;olider Judgment in Bu&s;ine&s;s of all Kinds,
&s;o, when it had a hopeful Pro&s;pect, no Man could keep his Mind longer
bent, and take more Pains in it. In the Treaty at <HI>Uxbridge,</HI> which was a
continued Fatigue of twenty Days, He never &s;lept four Hours in a Night, who
had never u&s;ed to allow him&s;elf le&s;s than ten, and at the End of the Treaty
was much more vigorous than in the Beginning; which made the Chan|cellor<MILESTONE N="10">
to tell the King when They returned to <HI>Oxford,</HI> &startq;that if He would
have the Earl of <HI>Southampton</HI> in good Health and good Humour, He mu&s;t
give him good Store of Bu&s;ine&s;s to do.&endq;</P>
<P>HIS Per&s;on was of a &s;mall Stature; his Courage, as all his other
Faculties, very great; having no Sign of Fear or Sen&s;e of Danger, when
He was in a Place where He ought to be found. When the King
had withdrawn him&s;elf from <HI>Oxford</HI> in Order to his E&s;cape to the <HI>Scotch</HI>
Army, and <HI>Fairfax</HI> had brought his Army before the Town; in &s;ome De|bate
at the Council-Board, there being &s;ome Mention of Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> with
Reference to his Dignity in a large Degree above all of the Nobility, the<MILESTONE N="20">
Earl of <HI>Southampton,</HI> who never u&s;ed to &s;peak indecently, u&s;ed &s;ome Expre&s;|&s;ions,
which, being unfaithfully reported to the Prince, his Highne&s;s inter|preted
to be di&s;re&s;pectful towards him: Whereupon He &s;ent the Lord <HI>Ge|rard</HI>
to expo&s;tulate with him. To whom the Earl without any Apology
related the Words He had u&s;ed; which being reported by him again to the
Prince, though they were not the &s;ame which He had been informed, yet
He was not &s;o well &s;atisfied with them, but that He &s;ent the &s;ame Lord to
him again to tell him, &startq;that his Highne&s;s expected other Satisfaction from
him, and expected to meet him with his Sword in his Hand, and de&s;ired
it might be as &s;oon as He could, le&s;t it might be prevented.&endq;<MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>THE Earl appointed the next Morning, at a Place well known; and
being a&s;ked &startq;what Weapon He cho&s;e,&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;that He had no Hor&s;e
fit for &s;uch a Service, nor knew where &s;uddenly to get one; and that He
knew him&s;elf too weak to clo&s;e with the Prince: And therefore He hoped
his Highne&s;s would excu&s;e him, if He made Choice of &s;uch Weapons as
He could be&s;t u&s;e; and therefore He re&s;olved to fight on Foot with a
Ca&s;e of Pi&s;tols only;&endq; which the Prince willingly con&s;ented to. And
without Doubt They had met the next Morning, the Earl having cho&s;en
Sir <HI>George Villiers</HI> for his Second; but that the Lord <HI>Gerard's</HI> coming to
the Earl &s;o often, with whom He had no Acquaintance, had been &s;o much<MILESTONE N="40">
ob&s;erved, that &s;ome of the Lords who had been pre&s;ent at the Debate at
the Board, and heard &s;ome Replies which had been made, and thence con|cluded
that ill Offices had been done, watched them Both &s;o narrowly, and
cau&s;ed the Town-Gates to be &s;hut, that They di&s;covered enough, notwith|&s;tanding
the Denial of Both Parties, to prevent their Meeting; and afterwards
interpo&s;ed till a Reconciliation was made: And the Prince ever afterwards
had a good Re&s;pect for the Earl.</P>
<P>AFTER the Murder of the King, the Earl of <HI>Southampton</HI> remained in
his own Hou&s;e, without the lea&s;t Application to tho&s;e Powers which had
made them&s;elves &s;o terrible, and which &s;eemed to re&s;olve to root out the<MILESTONE N="50">
whole Party as well as the Royal Family; and would not receive a Civility
from any of them: And when <HI>Cromwell</HI> was near his Hou&s;e in the Coun|try,
upon the Marriage of his Son in tho&s;e Parts, and had a Purpo&s;e to have
<PB N="415" REF="421">
made a Vi&s;it to him; upon a private Notice thereof, He immediately re|moved
to another Hou&s;e at a greater Di&s;tance. He &s;ent frequently &s;ome
tru&s;ty Per&s;on to the King with &s;uch Pre&s;ents of Money, as He could receive
out of the Fortune They had left to him, which was &s;carce enough to &s;up|port
him in that Retirement: And after the Battle of <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> when the
Rebels had &s;et a Price upon the King's Head, and denounced the mo&s;t
terrible Judgment upon any Per&s;on, and his Po&s;terity, that &s;hould pre&s;ume
to give any Shelter or A&s;&s;i&s;tance to <HI>Charles Stuart</HI> towards his E&s;cape; He
&s;ent a faithful Servant to all tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who in Re&s;pect of their Fidelity
<MILESTONE N="10">and Activity were mo&s;t like to be tru&s;ted upon &s;uch an Occa&s;ion, that They
&s;hould adverti&s;e the King, &startq;that He would mo&s;t willingly receive him into
his Hou&s;e, and provide a Ship for his E&s;cape.&endq; And his Maje&s;ty received
this Adverti&s;ement from him the Day before He was ready to embark in a
&s;mall Ve&s;&s;el prepared for him in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex;</HI> which his Maje&s;ty always remem|bered,
as a worthy Te&s;timony of his Affection and Courage in &s;o general a
Con&s;ternation. And the Earl was u&s;ed to &s;ay, &startq;that after that miraculous
E&s;cape, how di&s;mal &s;oever the Pro&s;pect was, He had &s;till a Confidence
of his Maje&s;ty's Re&s;toration.&endq;</P>
<P>His own natural Di&s;po&s;ition inclined to melancholick; and his Retire|ment
<MILESTONE N="20">from all Conver&s;ation, in which He might have given &s;ome Vent to
his own Thoughts, with the Di&s;continuance of all tho&s;e bodily Exerci&s;es and
Recreations to which He had been accu&s;tomed, brought many Di&s;ea&s;es upon
him, which made his Life le&s;s plea&s;ant to him; &s;o that from the Time of the
King's Return, between the Gout and the Stone, He underwent great Afflic|tion.
Yet upon the happy Return of his Maje&s;ty He &s;eemed to recover great
Vigour of Mind, and undertook the Charge of High Trea&s;urer with much
Alacrity and Indu&s;try, as long as He had any Hope to get a Revenue &s;et|tled
proportionable to the Expen&s;e of the Crown (towards which his Intere&s;t
and Authority and Coun&s;el contributed very much), or to reduce the Ex|pen&s;e
<MILESTONE N="30">of the Court within the Limits of the Revenue. But when He di&s;|cerned
that the la&s;t did and would &s;till make the former impo&s;&s;ible (upon
which He made as frequent and lively Repre&s;entations as He thought him|&s;elf
obliged to do), and when He &s;aw Irregularities and Exce&s;&s;es to abound,
and to overflow all the Banks which &s;hould re&s;train them; He grew more
di&s;pirited, and weary of that Province, which expo&s;ed him to the Reproaches
which others ought to undergo, and which &s;upplied him not with Authority
to prevent them. And He had then withdrawn from the Burden, which He
infinitely de&s;ired to be ca&s;ed of, but out of Con&s;cience of his Duty to the
King, who He knew would &s;uffer in it; and that the People who knew his
<MILESTONE N="40">Affections very well, and already opened their Mouths wide again&s;t the Li|cen&s;e
of the Court, would believe it wor&s;e and incurable if He quitted the
Station He was in. This, and this only, prevailed with him &s;till to undergo
that Burden, even when He knew that They who enjoyed the Benefit of it
were as weary that He &s;hould be di&s;quieted with it.</P>
<P>HE was a Man of great and exemplary Virtue and Piety, and very regular
in his Devotions; yet was not generally believed by the Bi&s;hops to have an
Affection keen enough for the Government of the Church, becau&s;e He was
willing and de&s;irous, that Somewhat more might have been done to gratify
the <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> than They thought ju&s;t. But the Truth is; He had a
<MILESTONE N="50">perfect Dete&s;tation of all the Pre&s;byterian Principles, nor had ever had any
Conver&s;ation with their Per&s;ons, having during all tho&s;e wicked Times
&s;trictly ob&s;erved the Devotions pre&s;cribed by the Church of <HI>England;</HI> in the
Performance whereof He had always an orthodox Chaplain, one of tho&s;e
<PB N="416" REF="422">
deprived of their E&s;tates by that Government, which di&s;po&s;ed of the Church
as well as of the State. But it is very true, that upon the Ob&s;ervation of the
great Power and Authority which the <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> u&s;urped and were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of, even when <HI>Cromwell</HI> did all He could to dive&s;t them of it, and applied all
his Intere&s;t to oppre&s;s or &s;uppre&s;s them, in&s;omuch as They did often give a
Check to and divert many of his De&s;igns; He did believe that their Num|bers
and their Credit had been much greater than in Truth they were.
And then &s;ome Per&s;ons, who had Credit with him by being thought to
have an equal Aver&s;ion from them, per&s;uaded him to believe, that They
would be &s;atisfied with very ea&s;y Conce&s;&s;ions, which would bring no Preju|dice<MILESTONE N="10">
or Inconvenience to the Church. And this Imagination prevailed with
him, and more with others who loved them not, to wi&s;h that there might be
&s;ome Indulgence towards them. But that which had the &s;tronge&s;t Influence
upon him, and which made him le&s;s apprehen&s;ive of the Venom of any other
Sect, was the extreme Jealou&s;y He had of the Power and Malignity of the
<HI>Roman Catholicks;</HI> who&s;e Behaviour from the Time of the Suppre&s;&s;ion of the
Regal Power, and more &s;candalou&s;ly at and from the Time of the Murder
of the King, had very much irreconciled him towards them: And He did
believe, that the King and the Duke of <HI>York</HI> had a better Opinion of their
Fidelity, and le&s;s Jealou&s;y of their Affections, than They de&s;erved; and &s;o<MILESTONE N="20">
thought there could not be too great an Union of all other Intere&s;ts to con|trol
the Exorbitance of that. And upon this Argument, with his private
Friends, He was more pa&s;&s;ionate than in any other.</P>
<P>HE had a marvellous Zeal and Affection for the Royal Family; in&s;omuch
as the two Sons of the Duke of <HI>York</HI> falling Both into Di&s;tempers (of which
They Both &s;hortly after died) very few Days before his Death, He was &s;o
marvellou&s;ly affected with it, that many believed the Trouble of it, or a Pre|&s;age
what might befall the Kingdom by it, ha&s;tened his Death &s;ome Hours:
And in the Agony of Death, the very Morning He died, He &s;ent to know
how They did; and &s;eemed to receive &s;ome Relief, when the Me&s;&s;enger re|turned<MILESTONE N="30">
with the News, that They were Both alive and in &s;ome Degree
mended.</P>
<P>THE next Day after his Death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King re|&s;olves to put the Trea&s;ury into Commi&s;|&s;ion.</NOTE> which was about the End of <HI>May,</HI> the
King called the Chancellor into his Clo&s;et; and, the Duke of <HI>York</HI> being
only pre&s;ent, told him, &startq;that He could think of no Man fit to be Trea|&s;urer,
and therefore re&s;olved, as He had long done, to put that Office into
Commi&s;&s;ion;&endq; and then a&s;ked, &startq;who &s;hould be Commi&s;&s;ioners:&endq; To
which He an&s;wered, &startq;the Bu&s;ine&s;s would be much better done by a &s;ingle
Officer, if He could think of a fit one; for Commi&s;&s;ioners never had, ne|ver
would do, that Bu&s;ine&s;s well.&endq; The Duke of <HI>York</HI> &s;aid, &startq;that He<MILESTONE N="40">
believed it would be be&s;t done by Commi&s;&s;ion; it had been &s;o managed
during all the ill Times&endq; (for from the Beginning of the Troubles there
had been no Trea&s;urer): &startq;And He had ob&s;erved (and the King found the
Benefit of it), that though Sir <HI>William Compton</HI> was an extraordinary
Per&s;on, and better qualified than mo&s;t Men for that Charge, yet &s;ince his
Decea&s;e, that his Maje&s;ty had put the Office of the Ordnance under the
Government of Commi&s;&s;ioners, it was in much better Order, and the King
was better &s;erved there than He had ever been; and He believed He
would be &s;o likewi&s;e in the Office of the Trea&s;ury, if fit Per&s;ons were
cho&s;en for it, who might have Nothing el&s;e to do.&endq; And the King &s;eemed<MILESTONE N="50">
to be of the &s;ame Mind.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor replied, &startq;that He was very &s;orry, that They were Both
&s;o much delighted with the Function of Commi&s;&s;ioners,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel|lor advi&s;es him again&s;t it.</NOTE> which were more
<PB N="417" REF="423">
&s;uitable to the modelling a Commonwealth, than for the Support of Mo|narchy:
That during the late Troubles, whil&s;t the Parliament exerci&s;ed
the Government, They reduced it as fa&s;t as They could to the Form of
a Commonwealth; and then no Que&s;tion the putting the Trea&s;ury into
the Hands of Commi&s;&s;ioners was much more &s;uitable to the re&s;t of the
Model, than it could be under a &s;ingle Per&s;on. Be&s;ides, having no Re|venue
of their own, but being to rai&s;e one according to their Inventions
and proportionable to their own Occa&s;ions, it could never be well col|lected
or ordered by old Officers, who were obliged to Forms which would
<MILESTONE N="10">not be agreeable to their nece&s;&s;ary Tran&s;actions: So that new Mini&s;ters
were to be made for new Employments, who might be obliged punctually
to ob&s;erve their new Orders, without any Superiority over each other, but
a joint Obedience to the &s;upreme Authority. But when <HI>Cromwell</HI> a&s;&s;umed
the entire Government into his own Hands, He cancelled all tho&s;e Re|publican
Rules and Forms, and appointed inferiour Per&s;ons to &s;everal
Functions, and re&s;erved the whole Di&s;po&s;ition to him&s;elf, and was his
own High Trea&s;urer: And it was well known that He re&s;olved, as &s;oon
as He &s;hould be able to reduce Things to the Forms He intended, to can|cel
all tho&s;e Commi&s;&s;ions, and inve&s;t &s;ingle Per&s;ons in the Government of
<MILESTONE N="20">tho&s;e Provinces.&endq;</P>
<P>HE &s;aid, &startq;He would not take upon him to &s;ay any Thing of the Office
of the Ordnance, where the Commi&s;&s;ioners were his Friends; only He
might &s;ay, that that Kind of Admini&s;tration had not been yet long enough
known to have a good Judgment made of it: However, that it was of &s;o
different a Nature from the Office of the Trea&s;ury, that no Ob&s;ervation of
the one could be applied to the other. The Ordnance was conver&s;ant
only with Smiths and Carpenters, and other Artificers and Handicrafts|men,
with whom all their Tran&s;actions were: Whereas the Trea&s;ury had
much to do with the Nobility and chief Gentry of the Kingdom; mu&s;t
<MILESTONE N="30">have often Recour&s;e to the King him&s;elf for his particular Directions, to
the Privy Council for their A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Advice, to the Judges for their
Re&s;olutions in Matters of Difficulty; and if the Mini&s;ters of it were not
of that Quality and Degree, that They might have free Recour&s;e to all
tho&s;e, and find Re&s;pect from them, his Maje&s;ty's Service would notoriou&s;ly
&s;uffer. And that the White Staff it&s;elf, in the Hands of a Per&s;on e&s;teemed,
did more to the bringing in &s;everal Branches of the Revenue, by the Obe|dience
and Reverence all Officers paid to it, than any Orders from Com|mi&s;&s;ioners
could do: And that how mean an Opinion &s;oever &s;ome Men
had of the Faculties of the late excellent Officer for that Admini&s;tration, his
<MILESTONE N="40">Maje&s;ty would find by Experience, that the va&s;t Sums of Money, which
He had borrowed in the&s;e late Years, had been in a great Mea&s;ure pro|cured
upon the general Confidence all Men had in the Honour and Ju&s;tice
of the Trea&s;urer; and that the Credit of Commi&s;&s;ioners would never be
able to &s;upply &s;uch Nece&s;&s;ities.&endq;</P>
<P>THE King &s;aid, &startq;He was not at all of his Opinion, and doubted not his
Bu&s;ine&s;s would be much better done by Commi&s;&s;ioners; and therefore He
&s;hould &s;peak to the Nomination of tho&s;e, &s;ince He was &s;ure He could pro|po&s;e
no &s;ingle Per&s;on fit for it.&endq; To which the Chancellor an&s;wered, &startq;that
He thought it much harder to find a worthy Man, who would be per&s;uaded
<MILESTONE N="50">to accept it in the Di&s;order in which his Affairs were, than a Man who
might be very fit for it: And that if that Subject who had the greate&s;t For|tune
in <HI>England</HI> and the mo&s;t general Reputation would receive it, his Ma|je&s;ty
would be no Lo&s;er in conferring it on &s;uch a one; and till &s;uch a one
<PB N="418" REF="424">
might be found, He might put it into Commi&s;&s;ion. But,&endq; He &s;aid,
&startq;He perceived well, that He would not approve the old Cour&s;e in the
Choice of Commi&s;&s;ioners; who had always been the Keeper of the Great
Seal, and the two Secretaries of State, and two other of the principal Per|&s;ons
of the Council, be&s;ides the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who u&s;ed
to be the &s;ole Per&s;on of the <HI>Quorum.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>NEITHER the King nor Duke &s;eemed to like any of tho&s;e; and the Chan|cellor
plainly di&s;cerned from the Beginning that They were re&s;olved upon
the Per&s;ons, though his Opinion was a&s;ked: And the King &s;aid, &startq;He would
choo&s;e &s;uch Per&s;ons, whether Privy Coun&s;ellors or not, who might have<MILESTONE N="10">
Nothing el&s;e to do, and were rough and illnatured Men, not to be moved
with Civilities or Importunities in the Payment of Money; but would
apply it all to his pre&s;ent Nece&s;&s;ities, till &s;ome new Supplies might be
gotten for the Payment of tho&s;e Debts, which were fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to be
paid. That He, the Chancellor, had &s;o much Bu&s;ine&s;s already upon
his Hands, that He could not attend this other; and the Secretaries
had enough to do: So He would have none of tho&s;e.&endq; And then He
named Sir <HI>Thomas Clifford,</HI> who was newly of the Council and Controller
of the Hou&s;e, and Sir <HI>William Coventry;</HI> and &s;aid, &startq;He did not think
there &s;hould be many:&endq; And the Duke then named Sir <HI>John Duncombe,</HI><MILESTONE N="20">
as a Man of whom He had heard well, and every Body knew He was inti|mate
with Sir <HI>William Coventry.</HI> The King &s;aid, &startq;He thought They three
would be enough, and that a greater Number would but make the Di&s;|patch
of all Bu&s;ine&s;s the more &s;low.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Chancellor &s;aid, &startq;He doubted tho&s;e Per&s;ons would not have Credit
and Authority enough to go through the nece&s;&s;ary Affairs of that Pro|vince;
that for his own Part, He was not de&s;irous to meddle in it; He
had indeed too much Bu&s;ine&s;s to do: That He had no Objection to the
three Per&s;ons named, but that He thought them not known and e&s;teemed
enough for that Employment; and that it would be very incongruous to<MILESTONE N="30">
bring Sir <HI>John Duncombe,</HI> who was a private Country Gentleman, and ut|terly
unacquainted with Bu&s;ine&s;s of that Nature, to &s;it in equal Authority
with Privy Coun&s;ellors, and in Affairs which would be often debated at
the Council-Table, where He could not be pre&s;ent.&endq; And He put his
Maje&s;ty in Mind, &startq;that He mu&s;t put the Lord <HI>A&s;hley</HI> out of his Office of
Chancellor of the Exchequer, if He did not make him Commi&s;&s;ioner of
the Trea&s;ury, and of the <HI>Quorum:</HI>&endq; And concluded, &startq;that if He did
not name the General, and &s;ome other Per&s;on that might give &s;ome Lu&s;tre
to the others, the Work would not be done as it ought to be; for many
Per&s;ons would be &s;ometimes obliged to attend upon the Trea&s;ury, who<MILESTONE N="40">
would not think tho&s;e Gentlemen enough &s;uperiour to them, how qua|lified
&s;oever.&endq;</P>
<P>THE King &s;aid, &startq;He could ea&s;ily provide again&s;t the Exception to
Sir <HI>John Duncombe,</HI> by making him a Privy Coun&s;ellor; and He did
not care if He added the General to them.&endq; The Lord <HI>A&s;hley</HI> gave
him &s;ome Trouble, and He &s;aid enough to make it manife&s;t that He
thought him not fit to be among&s;t them: Yet He knew not how to put
him out of his Place;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Trea&s;ury appointed.</NOTE> but gave Direction for preparing the Commi&s;&s;ion for
the Trea&s;ury to the Per&s;ons named before, and made the Lord <HI>A&s;hley</HI> only
one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, and a major Part to make a <HI>Quorum;</HI> which<MILESTONE N="50">
would quickly bring the Government of the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s into the Hands
of tho&s;e three who were de&s;igned for it. And <HI>A&s;hley</HI> rather cho&s;e to be de|graded,
than to di&s;pute it.</P>
<P><PB N="419" REF="425">
THE King expected,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Negotiations at</HI> Breda.</NOTE> that as &s;oon as the Amba&s;&s;adours &s;hould meet at
the <HI>Hague,</HI> a Ce&s;&s;ation would be the fir&s;t Thing that would be agreed upon:
And the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;adours did in the fir&s;t Place propo&s;e it, and in &s;uch
a Manner, as made it evident that They depended upon it as a Thing re|&s;olved
upon; and their Ma&s;ter had with their Con&s;ent di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his own

all the Earne&s;tne&s;s u&s;ed by the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;adours, no other An|&s;wer
could be obtained as to a Ce&s;&s;ation; which, together with the &s;uper|cilious
Behaviour of the Commi&s;&s;ioners from <HI>Holland,</HI> made it apparent, that
They had no other Mind at that Time to Peace, than as They were com|pelled
to it by <HI>France,</HI> that was impatient to have it concluded. They would
not hear any Mention for the Redelivery of <HI>Poleroone,</HI> &startq;which,&endq; They &s;aid,
the King of <HI>France</HI> had promi&s;ed &s;hould not be demanded;&endq; and as little
for any Recompen&s;e in Money; nor would &s;uffer the Merchant-Deputies from

<MILESTONE N="20">Company there for any Compo&s;ition. It quickly appeared, that They had

for this Summer. But whatever had been thought or directed, very little
had been done. There were a Company or two of very good Soldiers there
under excellent Officers; but the Fortifications were &s;o weak and unfini&s;hed,
<MILESTONE N="50">and all other Provi&s;ions &s;o entirely wanting, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet no &s;ooner
approached within a Di&s;tance, but with their Cannon They beat all the
Works flat, and drove all the Men from the Ground: Which as &s;oon as
<PB N="420" REF="426">
They had done, with their Boats They landed Men, and &s;eemed re&s;olved to fortify and keep it.</P>
<P>THIS put the Country into a Flame, and the News of it exceedingly
di&s;turbed the King. He knew the Con&s;equence of the Place, and how ea&s;ily
it might have been &s;ecured, and was the more troubled that it had been
neglected: And with what Lo&s;s &s;oever, it mu&s;t be pre&s;ently recovered out
of tho&s;e Hands. The General was immediately ordered to march to <HI>Chat|ham,</HI>
for the Security of the Navy, with &s;uch Troops of Hor&s;e and Foot as
could be pre&s;ently drawn together out of the Guards, and from the neigh|bour
Counties; and the City appeared very forward to &s;end &s;uch Regiments<MILESTONE N="10">
of their Trainbands as &s;hould be required. When the General came to <HI>Chat|ham,</HI>
He found <HI>Middleton</HI> in &s;o good a Po&s;ture, and &s;o good a Body of Men,
that He had no Apprehen&s;ion of any Attempt the <HI>Dutch</HI> could make at
Land; and He writ very cheerful and confident Letters to the King and
the Duke, &startq;that if the Enemy &s;hould make any Attempt, which He be|lieved
They dur&s;t not do, They would repent it. That He had put a
Chain over the River, which would hinder them from coming up: And if
They &s;hould adventure to land any where, He would quickly beat them
to their Ships;&endq; as no Doubt He had been very well able to have done.</P>
<P>THERE was indeed no Danger of their landing, and They were too wife<MILESTONE N="20">
to think of it: Their Bu&s;ine&s;s was in an Element They had more Confidence
in and more Power upon. They had good Intelligence how loo&s;ely all
Things were left in the River: And therefore as &s;oon as the Tide came to
help them, They &s;tood full up the River, without any Con&s;ideration of the
Chain, which their Ships immediately brake in Pieces, and pa&s;&s;ed without
the lea&s;t Pau&s;e; there being either no &s;uch Device to be made that can ob|&s;truct
&s;uch an Enterpri&s;e, or that which was made was &s;o weak, that it was
of no Signification, but to rai&s;e an un&s;ea&s;onable Confidence in un&s;kilful Men,
that being di&s;appointed mu&s;t increa&s;e the Confu&s;ion, as it did. For all Men
were &s;o confounded to &s;ee the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet advance over the Chain, which<MILESTONE N="30">
They looked upon as a Wall of Bra&s;s, that They knew not what They
were to do.</P>
<P>THE General was of a Con&s;titution and Temper &s;o void of Fear, that
there could appear no Signs of Di&s;traction in him: Yet it was plain enough
that He knew not what Orders to give. There were two or three Ships of
the Royal Navy negligently, if not treacherou&s;ly, left in the River, which
might have been very ea&s;ily drawn into Safety, and could be of no ima|ginable
U&s;e in the Place where they then were: Into one of tho&s;e the Ge|neral
put him&s;elf, and invited the young Gentlemen who were Volunteers to
accompany him; which They readily did in great Numbers, only with Pikes<MILESTONE N="40">
in their Hands. But &s;ome of his Friends whi&s;pered to him, &startq;how unad|vi&s;ed
that Re&s;olution was, and how de&s;perate, without Po&s;&s;ibility of Suc|ce&s;s,
the whole Fleet of the Enemy approaching as fa&s;t as the Tide would
enable them.&endq; And &s;o He was prevailed with to put him&s;elf again on
Shore: Which except He had done, both him&s;elf and two or three hundred
Gentlemen of the Nobility and prime Gentry of the Kingdom had in|evitably
peri&s;hed; for all tho&s;e Ships, and &s;ome Merchant-Men laden and
ready to put to Sea, were pre&s;ently in a Flame; the <HI>Dutch,</HI> knowing that
They could not carry them off, giving Order to burn them, the General
&s;tanding upon the Shore, and not knowing what Remedy to apply to all<MILESTONE N="50">
this Mi&s;chief. The People of <HI>Chatham,</HI> which is naturally an Army of
Seamen and Officers of the Navy, who might and ought to have &s;ecured all
tho&s;e Ships, which They had Time enough to have done, were in Di&s;trac|tion;
<PB N="421" REF="427">
their chief Officers having applied all tho&s;e Boats and lighter Ve&s;&s;els
which &s;hould have towed up the Ships, to carry away their own Goods and
Hou&s;hold&s;tuff, and given what They left behind for lo&s;t. And without
Doubt, if the <HI>Dutch</HI> had pro&s;ecuted the pre&s;ent Advantage They had, with
that Circum&s;pection and Courage that was nece&s;&s;ary, They might have fired
the Royal Navy at <HI>Chatham,</HI> and taken or de&s;troyed all the Ships which
lay higher in the River, and &s;o fully revenged them&s;elves for what They
had &s;uffered at the <HI>Flie:</HI> But They thought They had done enough, and &s;o
made U&s;e of the Ebb to carry them back again.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10">BUT the Noi&s;e of this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Con&s;ter|nation in the City and Court.</NOTE> and the Flame of the Ships which were burned,
made it ea&s;ily believed in the City of <HI>London,</HI> that the Enemy had done all
that They conceived They might have done: They thought that They were
landed in many Places, and that their Fleet was come up as far as <HI>Green|wich.</HI>
Nor was the Confu&s;ion there greater than it was in the Court it&s;elf:
Where They who had mo&s;t advanced the War, and reproached all them
who had been or were thought to be again&s;t it, &startq;as Men who had no pub|lick
Spirits, and were not &s;olicitous for the Honour and Glory of the Na|tion;&endq;
and who had never &s;poken of the <HI>Dutch</HI> but with Scorn and Con|tempt,
as a Nation rather worthy to be cudgelled than fought with; were now
<MILESTONE N="20">the mo&s;t dejected Men that can be imagined, railed very bitterly at tho&s;e who
had advi&s;ed the King to enter into that War, &startq;which had already con&s;umed
&s;o many gallant Men, and would probably ruin the Kingdom,&endq; and wi&s;hed&startq;
that a Peace, as the only Hope, were made upon any Terms.&endq; In a
Word; the Di&s;traction and Con&s;ternation was &s;o great in Court and City,
as if the <HI>Dutch</HI> had not been only Ma&s;ters of the River, but had really landed
an Army of one hundred thou&s;and Men.</P>
<P>THEY who remember that Conjuncture, and were then pre&s;ent in the
Galleries and privy Lodgings at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> whither all the World flocked
with equal Liberty, can ea&s;ily call to Mind many In&s;tances of &s;uch wild
<MILESTONE N="30">De&s;pair and even ridiculous Apprehen&s;ions, that I am willing to forget, and
would not that the lea&s;t Mention of them &s;hould remain: And if the King's
and Duke's per&s;onal Compo&s;ure had not re&s;trained Men from expre&s;&s;ing their
Fears, there wanted not &s;ome who would have advi&s;ed them to have left the
City. And there was a Lord, who would be thought one of the greate&s;t
Soldiers in <HI>Europe,</HI> to whom the Cu&s;tody of the <HI>Tower</HI> was committed, who
lodging there only one Night, declared &startq;that it was not tenable,&endq; and de|&s;ired
not to be charged with it: And thereupon many, who had carried
their Money and Goods thither, removed them from thence that they might
be farther from the River. Nor did this unrea&s;onable Di&s;temper pa&s;s away,
<MILESTONE N="40">when it was known that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet had not only left the River, but
had taken away all their Men from <HI>Sheerne&s;s,</HI> which was a Manife&s;tation
very &s;ufficient that They had no De&s;ign upon the Land: But there remained
&s;till &s;uch a Chagrin in the Minds of many, as if They would return again;
in which They were confirmed, when They heard that They were &s;till upon
the Coa&s;ts, and gave the &s;ame Alarm now to <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Suffolk,</HI> as They had
done to <HI>Kent,</HI> not without making a Shew as if They meant to attempt
<HI>Harwich</HI> and <HI>Landguard Point;</HI> which drew all the Trainbands of tho&s;e
Counties to the Sea&s;ide, and the Duke of <HI>York</HI> went thither to conduct them,
if there &s;hould be Occa&s;ion.</P>
<MILESTONE N="50">
<P>IN this Perplexity the King was not at Ea&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King ad|vi&s;ed to con|vent the Par|liament during the Pr$roga|tion.</NOTE> and the le&s;s that every Man
took upon him to di&s;cour&s;e to him of the Di&s;temper of the People generally
over the Kingdom, and to give him Coun&s;el what was to be done: And
&s;ome Men had advi&s;ed him to call the Parliament, which at the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion
<PB N="422" REF="428">
had been prorogued to the twentieth of <HI>October;</HI> and it was now the Mid|dle
of <HI>June.</HI> And &s;urely mo&s;t di&s;cerning Men thought &s;uch a Conjuncture
&s;o un&s;ea&s;onable for the Council of a Parliament, that if it had been then
fitting, the mo&s;t whole&s;ome Advice that could be given would be to &s;epa|rate
them, till that Occa&s;ion &s;hould be over, which could be be&s;t provided
for by a more contracted Council: However not knowing el&s;e what to do
di&s;po&s;ed the King to incline to that Remedy. And it being a current Opi|nion,
or rather an unque&s;tioned Certainty, that upon a Prorogation a Par|liament
cannot be convened before the Day, though upon an Adjournment
it may; They had brought Mr. <HI>Prynne</HI> privately to the King to &s;atisfy him,<MILESTONE N="10">
&startq;that upon an extraordinary Occa&s;ion He might do it:&endq; And his Judgment,
which in all other Ca&s;es He did enough undervalue, very much confirmed
him in what He had a Mind to.</P>
<P>IN the Beginning of the Summer, when He had re&s;olved to have no Fleet
at Sea, there were many Rea&s;ons which induced him to increa&s;e his Forces
at Land. And that He might do it without Jealou&s;y of the People, He gave
Commi&s;&s;ion to three or four Per&s;ons of the Nobility, of great Fortunes and
good Names, to rai&s;e Regiments of Foot, and to others for Troops of Hor&s;e;
which was done at their own Charge, and with wonderful Expedition: And
upon their fir&s;t Mu&s;ters They all received one Month's Pay. Of the&s;e Le|vies<MILESTONE N="20">
&s;ome were &s;ent to repo&s;&s;e&s;s <HI>Sheerne&s;s,</HI> and extraordinary Care was taken
for the better Advancement of tho&s;e Fortifications; and others were di&s;po&s;ed
to other Po&s;ts upon the Coa&s;t: But it was in View, that upon the Expira|tion
of that Month, there mu&s;t be new Pay provided for tho&s;e Regiments
and Troops. Then the Trainbands, which had been drawn together, had
continued for one Month, which was as long as the Law required: And
now They required, or were &s;aid to require, to be relieved or di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, or
that They might receive Pay. There were Di&s;contents and Emulations upon
Command; and They who had u&s;ually pro&s;e&s;&s;ed, &startq;that They would wil|lingly
&s;erve the King in the Offices of Corporals or Serjeants, whatever<MILESTONE N="30">
Command They formerly had,&endq; now di&s;puted all the Punctilios, and
would not receive Orders from any who had been formerly in inferiour Of|fices.
And all the&s;e Waywardne&s;&s;es were brought to the King, as Matters of
the highe&s;t Con&s;equence, who found Difficulty enough in determining Points
of more Importance.</P>
<P>THEY who for their own private De&s;igns de&s;ired that the Parliament might
meet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Privy Council con|&s;ulted about the rea&s;&s;em|bling the Par|liament.</NOTE> and cared not in what Humour They met, urged the King very im|portunately,
&startq;that He would i&s;&s;ue out a Proclamation to &s;ummon them,
as the only Expedient to give him&s;elf Ea&s;e, and to provide for all that was
to be done:&endq; And his Maje&s;ty was mo&s;t inclined to it, and in Truth re|&s;olved<MILESTONE N="40">
it; though knowing that it was contrary to the Sen&s;e of many, He
re&s;olved to debate it at the Council. And there He told them, &startq;that They
all &s;aw the Streights that He was in, the In&s;olence of the Enemy, and the
general Di&s;temper of the Nation, which made it manife&s;t that it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for him to have an Army, that might be ready again&s;t any Thing
that might fall out. That He had no Money, nor knew where to get
any; nor could imagine any other Way to provide again&s;t the Mi&s;chiefs
which were in View, than by calling the Parliament to come together, of
which or any other Expedient He was willing to receive their Advice;&endq;
expre&s;&s;ing &s;o much of his own Sen&s;e, that it was plain enough that He<MILESTONE N="50">
thought that Remedy the be&s;t that could be applied. Three or four of tho&s;e
who fate at the lower End of the Board, and who were well enough known
to have given the Coun&s;el, and to be indu&s;trious that it might be followed,
<PB N="423" REF="429">
enlarged them&s;elves in the Debate, &startq;that the Soldiers could not be kept to|gether
without Money; and They could not advi&s;e any other Way to get
Money but by the convening the Parliament, which They were confident
might ju&s;tly and regularly be done:&endq; And They de&s;ired, &startq;that They
who were of another Opinion would propo&s;e &s;ome other Way how the
King might get Money.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Chancellor di&s;cerned that the Matter was already concluded, what
Advice &s;oever &s;hould be given; and that the three new Commi&s;&s;ioners of the
Trea&s;ury, &s;ince They could find no Way to procure Money, had been very
<MILESTONE N="10">importunate with the King to try that Expedient, and the more, becau&s;e
They well knew that He was again&s;t it, He having not been at all re&s;erved
upon &s;everal Occa&s;ions in private Di&s;cour&s;es, when They were pre&s;ent, to
give many Rea&s;ons again&s;t it: And He knew as well, that They would
gladly make any U&s;e of any Expre&s;&s;ions which might fall from him, when
the Remembrance might be applied to his Prejudice. Yet his natural Un|warine&s;s
in &s;uch Ca&s;es with Reference to him&s;elf, when He thought his Ma|je&s;ty's
Service concerned, to which He did really believe the pre&s;ent Advice
would produce much Prejudice, prevailed with him to di&s;&s;uade it.</P>
<P>HE &s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel|lor oppo&s;es it.</NOTE> &startq;He knew well upon what Di&s;advantage He &s;pake, and how
<MILESTONE N="20">unpopular a Thing it was to &s;peak again&s;t the convening the Parliament
in tho&s;e Streights, which &s;eemed to be capable of no other Remedy: Yet
&s;ince He thought the Remedy neither proper to the Di&s;ea&s;e, nor that it
could be applied in Time, He could not concur with tho&s;e who advi&s;ed
it. That mo&s;t Men who had any Knowledge in the Law did confe&s;s,
that when the Parliament &s;tood prorogued to a certain Day, the convening
them upon a &s;ooner Day was very doubtful; and to him, upon all the
Di&s;qui&s;ition He could make, it was very clear that it could not be done:
And therefore He de&s;ired the Judges might be con&s;ulted in that Point,
before any Re&s;olution &s;hould be taken. That the Temper of Both Hou&s;es
<MILESTONE N="30">was well known; and that it could not but be pre&s;umed, that when They
came together, the fir&s;t Debate They would fall upon would be of the
Manner of their coming together, and whether They were in a Capacity
to act: And He doubted there would be very few who would be for|ward
to pa&s;s an Act in a Sea&s;on, when the Validity of it might be que&s;|tioned
by tho&s;e who had no Mind to pay any Obedience to it. And then
if their Meeting were only to confer together upon all Occurrences, and
They might pre&s;ume of Liberty to &s;ay what They had a Mind to &s;ay,
without Power to conclude any Thing; it was well worth the con&s;idering,
whether, in &s;o general a Di&s;temper, &s;uch an A&s;&s;embly might not inter|rupt
<MILESTONE N="40">all other Con&s;ultations and Expedients, and yet propo&s;e none, and
&s;o increa&s;e the Confu&s;ion. If the Nece&s;&s;ities were &s;o urgent, that it was
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that a Parliament &s;hould be convened, and that which
&s;tood prorogued could not lawfully rea&s;&s;emble till the twentieth of <HI>Oc|tober,</HI>
as He was confident it could not; there was no Que&s;tion to be
made, but that the King might lawfully by his Proclamation pre&s;ently
di&s;&s;olve the prorogued Parliament, and &s;end out his Writs to have a new
Parliament, which might regularly meet a Month before the prorogued
Parliament could come together.&endq; And many of the Council were of
Opinion, that it would mo&s;t conduce to his Maje&s;ty's Service to di&s;&s;olve the
<MILESTONE N="50">one, and to call another Parliament.</P>
<P>THIS was an Advice They believed no Man had the Courage to make,
and were &s;orry to find &s;o many of the Opinion, which They had rather
&s;hould have appeared to be &s;ingle. Many very warmly oppo&s;ed this Expe|dient,
<PB N="424" REF="430">
magnified the Affections and Inclinations of Both Hou&s;es: &startq;And
though there appeared &s;ome ill Humour in them at their la&s;t being toge|ther,
and Aver&s;ion to give any Money for the pre&s;ent; yet in the Main
their Affections were very right for Church and State. And that the
King was never to hope to &s;ee a Parliament better con&s;tituted for his Ser|vice,
or &s;o many of the Members at his Di&s;po&s;al: But that He mu&s;t ex|pect
that the <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> would be cho&s;en in all Places, and that They
who were mo&s;t eminent now for oppo&s;ing all that He de&s;ired would be
cho&s;en, and all They who were mo&s;t zealous for his Service would be
carefully excluded;&endq; which was a Fancy that &s;unk very deep in the Minds<MILESTONE N="10">
of the Bi&s;hops, though their be&s;t Friends thought them like to find more
Friends and a &s;tronger Support in any, than They would have in that Par|liament.
But the King quickly declared his Confidence in the Parliament
that was prorogued, and his Re&s;olution not to di&s;&s;olve it; which put an
End to that Debate. And the other was again re&s;umed, &startq;what the King
was to do towards the rai&s;ing Money; or how He &s;hould be able to
maintain his Army, if He &s;hould defer calling the Parliament till the Day
upon which They were to a&s;&s;emble by the Prorogation:&endq; And all Men
were to re&s;train their Di&s;cour&s;e to that Point.</P>
<P>THE old Argument, &startq;that there could be no other Way found out,&endq;<MILESTONE N="20">
was renewed, and urged with more Earne&s;tne&s;s and Confidence; and that
They who were again&s;t it might be obliged to offer their Advice what other
Cour&s;e &s;hould be taken: And this was often demanded, in a Manner not
u&s;ual in that Place, as a Reproach to the Per&s;ons. His Maje&s;ty him&s;elf with
&s;ome Quickne&s;s was plea&s;ed to a&s;k the Chancellor, &startq;what He did advi&s;e.&endq;
To which He replied, &startq;that if in Truth what was propo&s;ed was in the Na|ture
of it not practicable, or being practi&s;ed could not attain the Effect
propo&s;ed, it ought to be laid a&s;ide, that Men might unbia&s;&s;ed apply their
Thoughts to find out &s;ome other Expedient. That He thought it very
clear that the Parliament could not a&s;&s;emble, though the Proclamation<MILESTONE N="30">
&s;hould i&s;&s;ue out that very Hour, within le&s;s than twenty Days; and that
if They were met, and believed them&s;elves lawfully qualified to grant a
Supply of Money, all Men knew the Formality of that Tran&s;action would
require &s;o much Time, that Money could not be rai&s;ed Time enough to
rai&s;e an Army, or to maintain that Part of it that was rai&s;ed, to prevent
the landing of an Enemy that was already upon the Coa&s;t, and (as many
thought or &s;eemed to think) ready every Day to make their De&s;cent: And
yet the &s;ending out a Proclamation for rea&s;&s;embling the Parliament would
inevitably put an End to all other Coun&s;els. That for his Part He did
believe, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> had already &s;atisfied them&s;elves in the Affront<MILESTONE N="40">
They had given, and could not be in any Condition to pur&s;ue it, or have
Men enough on Board to make a De&s;cent, without the King's having
Notice of it; and that the <HI>Dutch,</HI> without a Conjunction with the <HI>French,</HI>
had not Strength for &s;uch an Undertaking: And that the <HI>French</HI> had no
&s;uch Purpo&s;e his Maje&s;ty had all the A&s;&s;urance po&s;&s;ible, and that their
Fleet was gone far from the Coa&s;t of <HI>England.</HI> And his Maje&s;ty had
Rea&s;on to believe, that the pre&s;ent Treaty would put an End to this War
in a &s;hort Time, though the Power and Artifice of <HI>De Wit</HI> had prevented
a Ce&s;&s;ation.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;HOWEVER, for the pre&s;ent Support of tho&s;e Troops which were nece&s;&s;ary<MILESTONE N="50">
to guard the Coa&s;ts, &s;ince Money could not be found for their pre&s;ent con|&s;tant
Pay, without which free Quarter could not be avoided; the only
Way that appeared to him to be practicable, and to avoid the la&s;t Evil,
<PB N="425" REF="431">
would be, to write Letters to the Lieutenants and Deputy-Lieutenants of
tho&s;e Counties where the Troops were obliged to remain, <HI>that They would
cau&s;e Provi&s;ions of all Kinds to be brought into tho&s;e Quarters,</HI> that &s;o the
Soldiers might not be compelled to &s;traggle abroad to provide their own Vic|tual,
which would end in the wor&s;t Kind of free Quarter: And that the like
Letters might be written to the neighbour Counties, wherein no Soldiers
were quartered, to rai&s;e Money by Way of Contribution or Loan, which
&s;hould be abated out of the next Impo&s;itions, that &s;o the Troops might be
enabled to &s;tay and continue in the Po&s;ts where They were, for Defence
<MILESTONE N="10">of the Kingdom; in which tho&s;e other Counties had their Share in the
Benefit, and without which They mu&s;t them&s;elves be expo&s;ed to the Di&s;|order
of the Soldiers, and po&s;&s;ibly to the Inva&s;ion of the Enemy.&endq;</P>
<P>IT is very probable, that in the Earne&s;tne&s;s of this Debate, and the fre|quent
Interruptions which were given, He might u&s;e that Expre&s;&s;ion (which
was afterwards objected again&s;t him) &startq;of rai&s;ing Contribution as had been
in the late civil War.&endq; Whatever it was He &s;aid, it was evident at the
Time that &s;ome Men were well plea&s;ed with it, as Somewhat They meant
to make U&s;e of hereafter, in which his Innocence made him little concerned.</P>
<P>THE Conclu&s;ion was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment &s;ummon|ed to meet.</NOTE> though many of the Lords &s;pake again&s;t it, and
<MILESTONE N="20">much the major Part thought it not coun&s;ellable; that a Proclamation
&s;hould forthwith i&s;&s;ue out, to require all the Members of Parliament to meet
upon a Day appointed in the Beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> to con&s;ult upon the
great Affairs of the Kingdom: And this Proclamation was pre&s;ently i&s;&s;ued
accordingly.</P>
<P>ALL this Time the Treaty proceeded at <HI>Breda,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Treaty ad|vanced.</NOTE> as fa&s;t as the in&s;olent Hu|mour
of the <HI>Dutch</HI> would &s;uffer it. The <HI>French</HI> King declared him&s;elf
much offended with their Proceedings at Sea: And his Amba&s;&s;adours &s;pake
&s;o loud, that the <HI>States</HI> gave Order to their Deputies to bring the Treaty to

<MILESTONE N="30">Ho&s;tility of any Moment; only the Fleet remained at Sea, that it might ap|pear
They were Ma&s;ters of it. It cannot be denied that the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;|&s;adours,
except in what referred to <HI>Poleroone,</HI> behaved them&s;elves as candidly
as could be wi&s;hed: And it is probable, that the &s;ame Rea&s;on which moved
the <HI>French</HI> to u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible Diligence to bring the Treaty to an End, pre|vailed
likewi&s;e with the <HI>Dutch</HI> to u&s;e all the Delays They could, that it might
be prolonged.</P>
<P>THOUGH there was no War declared, it had been long notorious that
<HI>Flanders</HI> would be invaded: And it was as notorious, that there was no
Provi&s;ion made there towards a Re&s;i&s;tance or Defence; the Marquis of <HI>Ca&s;|telle
<MILESTONE N="40">Roderigo,</HI> who came Governour thither with a great Reputation, not
making good the Expectation in the Sagacity He was famed for, nor offer|ing
at any Levies of Men, or mending Fortifications, until the <HI>French</HI> Army
was upon the Borders. Then He &s;ent into <HI>England</HI> to pre&s;s the King to
a&s;&s;i&s;t him with an Army of Hor&s;e and Foot; and it ea&s;ily appeared the Na|tion
would gladly have engaged in that War, not being willing that <HI>Flan|ders</HI>
&s;hould be in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>France:</HI> But the King was engaged not
to give any A&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Enemies of <HI>France</HI> until the Treaty &s;hould be
ended, which yet it was not. However He &s;uffered the Earl of <HI>Ca&s;tle-ha|ven,</HI>
under Pretence of recruiting a Regiment in <HI>Flanders</HI> which He had
<MILESTONE N="50">formerly, to rai&s;e a Body of one thou&s;and Foot, which He quickly tran&s;|ported
to <HI>O&s;tend.</HI></P>
<P>THE King of <HI>France</HI> was impatient to march, and yet de&s;ired the Treaty
might be fir&s;t concluded, that both him&s;elf and the King of <HI>England</HI> might
<PB N="426" REF="432">
be at Liberty to enter into &s;uch an Alliance as They &s;hould think proper for
their Intere&s;t: And the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who had no Mind that the Expedition &s;hould
be pro&s;ecuted, and as much feared the Con&s;equence of &s;uch an Alliance,
though They were not wi&s;e enough to con&s;ider the right Means to prevent
it, de&s;ired that the Treaty might not be concluded till the Winter drew
nearer.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> French <HI>invade</HI> Flan|ders.</NOTE> But the <HI>French</HI> quickly put an End to that their Hope by march|ing
into the Heart of <HI>Flanders,</HI> and &s;o giving them new Matter for their
pre&s;ent Con&s;ultations; not without Intimation, &startq;that if They would not
fini&s;h the Treaty, that King would conclude for what concerned him&s;elf:&endq;
And this put an End to it. Yet there were &s;ome Alterations of &s;mall Im|portance<MILESTONE N="10">
in &s;ome Articles of the former Treaty, be&s;ides that of <HI>Poleroone,</HI>
which the Amba&s;&s;adours would not con&s;ent to without farther Knowledge
of the King's Plea&s;ure: And &s;o one of them (Mr. <HI>Henry Coventry</HI>) came to
attend his Maje&s;ty to give him an Account of all Particulars, and receive his
own final Determination.</P>
<P>THE King in the fir&s;t Place &s;ent for the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, and let
them know, &startq;that the <HI>Dutch</HI> would not con&s;ent to the former Article for
the Redelivery of <HI>Poleroone,</HI> nor give any Recompen&s;e for it; and that He
was re&s;olved not to depart from them, and &s;o relea&s;e their Right without
their Con&s;ent: And therefore that They &s;hould con&s;ider what would be<MILESTONE N="20">
for their Good.&endq;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Ea&s;t-In|dia <HI>Company give up their Claim to</HI> Po|leroone.</NOTE> They an&s;wered, &startq;that They thought a Peace to be &s;o

&startq;that if the War continued, They &s;hould in many Re&s;pects be
greater Lo&s;ers, than the Redelivery of <HI>Poleroone</HI> would repair; and that
They would gladly &s;acrifice that Pretence to the publick Peace.&endq;</P>
<P>UPON which An&s;wer the Amba&s;&s;adour made his Report of all the Parti|culars
which were con&s;ented to on Both Sides in the Treaty, and what re|mained
yet in Su&s;pen&s;e; and made An&s;wer to all Que&s;tions which any of the
Council thought fit to a&s;k. And the King requiring him to deliver his own<MILESTONE N="30">
Opinion upon his Ob&s;ervation, and &startq;whether He believed, that if his Ma|je&s;ty
&s;hould po&s;itively in&s;i&s;t upon what They had hitherto refu&s;ed to con|&s;ent
to, the <HI>Dutch</HI> would choo&s;e to continue the War; and whether the
<HI>French</HI> would join with them in it:&endq; He an&s;wered; &startq;that it was very evi|dent
that the <HI>Dutch</HI> did not at pre&s;ent de&s;ire the Peace, otherwi&s;e than to
comply with <HI>France</HI> and for Fear of it; and that <HI>France</HI> was obliged not
to abandon them in the Point of <HI>Poleroone,</HI> which the other would never
part with, nor give any Recompen&s;e for, though the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;a|dours
had u&s;ed all the Arguments to per&s;uade them to it. But if that
were agreed, He was confident They would be compelled to con&s;ent to<MILESTONE N="40">
what&s;oever was el&s;e of Moment. And that the <HI>French</HI> had u&s;ed &s;ome
threatening Expre&s;&s;ions, upon &s;ome in&s;olent Propo&s;itions made by the
<HI>Dane,</HI> which They thought proceeded from the In&s;tigation of <HI>Holland.</HI>
And that at his coming away, the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;adours had u&s;ed great
Freedom with him, and advi&s;ed <HI>in what Particulars which were yet un|agreed
They wi&s;hed his Maje&s;ty would not con&s;ent, and in which They could
not &s;erve him, but believed a Time would come, in which He would be re|paired
for tho&s;e Conde&s;cen&s;ions: In other Particulars He &s;hould po&s;itively
in&s;i&s;t, at lea&s;t with &s;ome little Variation of Expre&s;&s;ion;</HI> in which He ex|pre&s;&s;ed
both his own and the Opinion of the other Amba&s;&s;adour.&endq;<MILESTONE N="50"></P>
<P>AND the Whole being in this Manner clearly &s;tated, the King required all
the Lords &s;everally to deliver their Judgment what He was to do; and every
Man did deliver his Opinion in more or fewer Words. And it may be truly
<PB N="427" REF="433">
&s;aid, that, though one or two adorned their Pa&s;&s;ion with &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions
of Indignation again&s;t the <HI>Dutch</HI> for their Pre&s;umption, and as if They did
believe that the Parliament would concur with the King in all Things which
might vindicate his Honour from their in&s;olent Demands, the Advice was
upon the Matter unanimous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pri$y Council ad|vi&s;es the King to conclude the Treaty.</NOTE> &startq;that the Amba&s;&s;adours &s;hould immediately
return, and conclude the Peace upon tho&s;e Conditions which were &s;tated
at the Board.&endq; And He did pre&s;ently return: And all Matters were, within
few Days after his Arrival, adju&s;ted, and put into proper mini&s;terial Hands
for Engro&s;&s;ment, and all Forms and Circum&s;tances agreed upon for the Pro|clamation

<P>ALL this was done before the Day of the Parliament's convening upon the

Debate of any Bu&s;ine&s;s, but be continued under the former Prorogation to
<MILESTONE N="20">the Day appointed; and in this there appeared not one Per&s;on of a different
Opinion. And &s;o, upon the Day, the King went to the Hou&s;e, and told
them, &startq;that &s;ince the Condition of his Affairs was not &s;o full of Difficulty
as it had been when He &s;ent out his Proclamation, and &s;ince many were
of Opinion, that there might be Doubts ari&s;e upon the Regularity of their
Meeting; He was content to di&s;mi&s;s them till the twentieth of <HI>October:</HI>&endq;
And &s;o They &s;eparated without any Debate.</P>
<P>THE Publick no &s;ooner entered into this Repo&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Storm begins to ari&s;e again&s;t the Chancellor.</NOTE> than the Storm began
to ari&s;e that de&s;troyed all the Pro&s;perity, ruined the Fortune, and &s;hip|wrecked
all the Hopes, of the Chancellor, who had been the principal In|&s;trument
<MILESTONE N="30">in the providing that Repo&s;e. The Parliament, that had been &s;o
un&s;ea&s;onably called together from their Bu&s;ine&s;s and Recreations, in a Sea|&s;on
of the Year that They mo&s;t de&s;ired to be vacant, were not plea&s;ed to
be &s;o &s;oon di&s;mi&s;&s;ed: And very great Pains were taken by tho&s;e, who were
thought to be able to do him the lea&s;t Harm, becau&s;e They were known
to be his Enemies, to per&s;uade the Members of Parliament, &startq;that it was
the Chancellor only who had hindered their continuing together, and
that He had advi&s;ed the King to di&s;&s;olve them;&endq; which exceedingly
inflamed them.</P>
<P>AND Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> was &s;o far from being re&s;erved in his Malice,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sir</HI> William Coventry <HI>in|cen&s;es the Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons a|gain&s;t him.</HI></NOTE>
<MILESTONE N="40">that the very Day that the Parliament was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, after He had incen&s;ed
them again&s;t the Chancellor, in the Pre&s;ence of &s;ix or &s;even of the Members,
who were not all of the &s;ame Mind, He declared &startq;that if at their next Meet|ing,
which would be within little more than two Months, They had a
Mind to remove, the Chancellor from the Court, They &s;hould ea&s;ily bring
it to pa&s;s:&endq; Of all which He had quickly Information, and had &s;everal
other Adverti&s;ements from Per&s;ons of Honour, &startq;that there was a &s;trong
Combination entered into again&s;t him;&endq; and They mentioned &s;ome Par|ticulars
to have been told the King concerning him, which had exceedingly
offended his Maje&s;ty. All which Particulars, being without any Colour or
<MILESTONE N="50">Ground of Truth, He believed were Inventions (though not from tho&s;e who
informed him) only to amu&s;e him.</P>
<P>YET He took an Opportunity to acquaint the King with it, who, with
the &s;ame Openne&s;s He had always u&s;ed, conferred with him about his pre|&s;ent
<PB N="428" REF="434">
Bu&s;ine&s;s, but only of the Bu&s;ine&s;s. He be&s;ought his Maje&s;ty to let him
know, &startq;whether He had received any Information that He had done or
&s;aid &s;uch and &s;uch Things,&endq; which He made appear to him to be in
them&s;elves &s;o incredible and improbable, that it could hardly be in his Ma|je&s;ty's
Power to believe them; to which the King an&s;wered, &startq;that Nobody
had told him any &s;uch Thing.&endq; To which the other replied, &startq;that He
did really think They had not, though He knew that They had bragged
They had done &s;o, and thereby incen&s;ed his Maje&s;ty again&s;t him; which
They de&s;ired &s;hould be generally believed.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Truth is; the Chancellor was guilty of that him&s;elf which He had<MILESTONE N="10">
u&s;ed to accu&s;e the Archbi&s;hop <HI>Laud</HI> of, that He was too proud of a good
Con&s;cience. He knew his own Innocence, and had no Kind of Apprehen&s;ion of
being publickly charged with any Crime. He knew well He had many Enemies
who had Credit with the King, and that They did him all the ill Offices
They could: And He knew that the Lady's Power and Credit increa&s;ed,
and that She de&s;ired Nothing more than to remove him from his Maje&s;ty's
Confidence; in which He never thought her to blame, &s;ince She well knew
that He employed all the Credit He had to remove her from the Court.
But He thought him&s;elf very &s;ecure in the King's Ju&s;tice: And though his
Kindne&s;s was much le&s;&s;ened, He was confident his Maje&s;ty would protect<MILESTONE N="20">
him from being oppre&s;&s;ed, &s;ince He knew his Integrity; and never &s;u&s;pected
that He would con&s;ent to his Ruin. He was in Truth weary of the Con|dition
He was in, and had in the la&s;t Year undergone much Mortification;
and de&s;ired Nothing more, than to be dive&s;ted of all other Tru&s;ts and Em|ployments
than what concerned the Chancery only, in which He could
have no Rival, and in the Admini&s;tration whereof He had not heard of
any Complaint: And this He thought might have &s;atisfied all Parties; and
had &s;ometimes de&s;ired the King, &startq;that He might retire from all other Bu|&s;ine&s;s
than that of the Judicatory,&endq; for He plainly di&s;cerned He was not
able to contend with other Struggles.<MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>I CANNOT avoid in this Place mentioning an Accident that fell out in this
Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Particular relating to the Duke of</HI> Buck|ingham <HI>which ha&s;tens the Fa$$ of the Chancellor.</HI></NOTE> and enlarge upon all the Circum&s;tances thereof, which might other|wi&s;e
be pa&s;&s;ed over, but that it had an immediate Influence on the Fate of
the Per&s;on who is &s;o near his Fall. The King had been very much offended
with the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who had behaved him&s;elf much wor&s;e to|wards
him than could be expected from his Obligations and Di&s;cretion, and
had been in Truth the original Cau&s;e of all the ill Humour which had been
in Both Hou&s;es of Parliament in the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion; after the End of which
He went into the Country without taking his Leave of the King, and in
&s;everal Places &s;pake with greater Licen&s;e of the Court and Government, and<MILESTONE N="40">
of the Per&s;on of the King, than any other Per&s;on pre&s;umed to do; of all
which his Maje&s;ty had Intelligence and Information, and was at that Time
without Doubt more offended with him than with any Man in <HI>England,</HI>
and had really great Provocation to Jealou&s;y of his Fidelity, as well as
of his Re&s;pect and Affection. The Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> as Secretary of State, had
received &s;everal Informations of dangerous Words &s;poken by him again&s;t the
King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Account of the Duke's Behaviour.</NOTE> and of his Corre&s;pondencies with Per&s;ons the mo&s;t &s;u&s;pected for &s;edi|tious
Inclinations, the Duke having made him&s;elf very popular among&s;t the
<HI>Levellers,</HI> and among&s;t them who clamoured for Liberty of Con&s;cience, which
Pretence He &s;eemed very much to cheri&s;h.<MILESTONE N="50"></P>
<P>THE King was very much awakened to be jealous of him, be&s;ides his Be|haviour
in the Parliament, by &s;ome Informations He received from his own
Servants. There was one <HI>Braythwaite</HI> a Citizen, who had been a great
<PB N="429" REF="435">
Confident of <HI>Cromwell</HI> and of the <HI>Council of State,</HI> a Man of Parts, and
looked upon as having a greater Intere&s;t with the di&s;contented Party than
any Man of the City. Upon the King's Return this Man fled beyond the
Seas, and after near a Year's Stay there came again to <HI>London,</HI> but remained
there as <HI>incognito,</HI> came not upon the <HI>Exchange,</HI> nor was &s;een in Publick,
and returned again into <HI>Holland;</HI> and &s;o made frequent Journies backward
and forward for &s;everal Months, and then came and re&s;ided publickly in the
City. This being taken Notice of by Sir <HI>Richard Browne,</HI> who was Major
General of the City, upon who&s;e Vigilance the King very much and very
<MILESTONE N="10">ju&s;tly depended, and the Man being well known to him, He had long en|deavoured
to apprehend him, till He under&s;tood that He was a Servant to
the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and in great Tru&s;t with him, as He was; for
the Duke had committed the whole Managery of his E&s;tate to him, and upon
his Recommendation had received many other inferiour Servants to be em|ployed
under him, all of the &s;ame Leven with him, and all notorious for
their Di&s;affection to the Church and State. The Major General, being one
Day to give the King an Account of &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s, told him likewi&s;e of
this Man, &startq;as one as worthy to be &s;u&s;pected for all di&s;loyal Purpo&s;es, and as
like to bring them to pa&s;s, as any Man of that Condition in <HI>England;</HI>&endq;
<MILESTONE N="20">and &s;eemed to wonder &startq;that the Duke would entertain &s;uch a Per&s;on in
his Service.&endq;</P>
<P>AT that Time the Duke had by his Diligence, and tho&s;e Faculties to|wards
Mirth in which He excelled, made him&s;elf very acceptable to the
King; though many wondered that He could be &s;o, con&s;idering what the
King him&s;elf knew of him: In&s;omuch that his Maje&s;ty told him what He
had been informed of his Steward, and how much He &s;uffered in his Repu|tation
for entertaining &s;uch Servants. The Duke received the Animadver|&s;ion
with all po&s;&s;ible Submi&s;&s;ion and Acknowledgment of the Obligation,
and then enlarged upon the Commendation of the Man, &startq;of his great
<MILESTONE N="30">Abilities, and the Benefit He received by his Service;&endq; and be&s;ought
his Maje&s;ty &startq;that He would vouch&s;afe to hear him, for He believed
He would give an Account of the State of the City, and of many Parti|culars
which related to his Maje&s;ty's Service, better than mo&s;t Men could
do.&endq; And the King &s;hortly after &s;upping at the Duke's Hou&s;e, He
found an Opportunity to pre&s;ent Mr. <HI>Braythwaite</HI> to him, who was a Man
of a very good A&s;pect, which that People u&s;ed not to have, and of notable
In&s;inuation. He made the King a Narration of the whole Cour&s;e of his
Life, in which He did not endeavour to make him&s;elf appear a better Man
than He had been reported to be; which Kind of Ingenuity, as Men call
<MILESTONE N="40">it, is a wonderful Approach towards being believed. He related &startq;by what
Degrees, and in what Method of Conviction, He had explicated him&s;elf
from all tho&s;e ill Principles in which He had been entangled: And that it
had been a principal Motive to him to embrace the Opportunity of &s;erving
the Duke, that He might totally retire from that Company and Conver|&s;ation
to which He had been mo&s;t accu&s;tomed. And yet He thought He
had &s;o much Credit with the chief of them, that They could never enter
into any active Combination, but He &s;hould have Notice of it: And a&s;|&s;ured
his Maje&s;ty that Nothing &s;hould pa&s;s of Moment among&s;t that People,
but his Maje&s;ty &s;hould have very &s;ea&s;onable Information of it, and that
<MILESTONE N="50">He would always &s;erve him with great Fidelity.&endq; In Fine, the King was
well &s;atisfied with his Di&s;cour&s;e, and often afterwards upon the like Oppor|tunities
conferred with him, and believed him to be well di&s;po&s;ed to do him
any Service.</P>
<P><PB N="430" REF="436">
DURING the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, in which the Duke carried him|&s;elf
&s;o di&s;re&s;pectfully to the King, this Man found an Opportunity to get
Acce&s;s to his Maje&s;ty, which He was willing to give him; when He &s;aid,
&startq;that He thought it his Duty, and according to his Obligation, to give his
Maje&s;ty an Account of what He had lately ob&s;erved, and of his own Re&s;o|lutions.&endq;
He told him, &startq;that his Lord was of late very much altered,
and was fallen into the Acquaintance and Conver&s;ation of &s;ome Men of
very mean Condition, but of very de&s;perate Intentions; with whom He
u&s;ed to meet at un&s;ea&s;onable Hours, and in ob&s;cure Places, where Per|&s;ons
of Quality did not u&s;e to re&s;ort; and that He frequently received Let|ters<MILESTONE N="10">
from them: All which made him apprehend that there was a De&s;ign
on Foot, which, how unrea&s;onable &s;oever, the Duke might be engaged
in. And for the&s;e and other Rea&s;ons, and the irregular Cour&s;e of his
Life, He was re&s;olved to withdraw him&s;elf from his Service: And that He
hoped, into what Extravagancies &s;oever the Duke &s;hould ca&s;t him&s;elf, his
Maje&s;ty would retain a good Opinion of him, who would never &s;werve
from his Affection and Duty.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Information and Te&s;timony, which the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> brought to
the King &s;hortly after this Adverti&s;ement, made the greater Impre&s;&s;ion; and
there were many Particulars in the Informations that could not be &s;u&s;pected<MILESTONE N="20">
to be forged. And it appeared that there was a poor Fellow, who had a
poorer Lodging about <HI>Tower-Hill,</HI> and profe&s;&s;ed Skill in Horo&s;copes, to
whom the Duke often repaired in Di&s;gui&s;e in the Night: And the Lord <HI>Ar|lington</HI>
had cau&s;ed that Fellow to be apprehended, and his Pockets and his
Chamber to be &s;earched; where were found &s;everal Letters to the Duke of
<HI>Buckingham,</HI> one or two whereof were in his Pocket &s;ealed and not &s;ent,
and the re&s;t Copies, and one original Letter from the Duke to him, in all
which there were many unu&s;ual Expre&s;&s;ions, which were capable of a very
ill Interpretation, and could not bear a good one. This Man and &s;ome
others were &s;ent clo&s;e Pri&s;oners to the <HI>Tower,</HI> where the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI><MILESTONE N="30">
and two other Privy Coun&s;ellors, by the King's Order, took their &s;everal
Examinations, and confronted them with tho&s;e Witne&s;&s;es, who accu&s;ed them
and ju&s;tified their Accu&s;ations; all which were brought to the King.</P>
<P>AND then his Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to acquaint the Chancellor with all that
had pa&s;&s;ed, who to that Minute had not the lea&s;t Imagination of any Par|ticular
relating to it: Nor had He any other Prejudice to the Per&s;on of
the Duke (for He behaved him&s;elf towards him with more than ordinary
Civility), than what was nece&s;&s;ary for any Man to have upon Account of the
Extravagancy of his Life; and which He could not be without, upon what
He had often received from the Duke him&s;elf upon his own Knowledge.<MILESTONE N="40">
The King now &s;hewed him all tho&s;e Examinations and Depo&s;itions which
had been taken; and that Letter to the Fellow, &startq;which,&endq; his Maje&s;ty &s;aid,
&startq;He knew to be every Word the Duke's own Hand;&endq; and the Letters to
the Duke from the Fellow, which &s;till gave him the Style of Prince, and
mentioned what <HI>great Things his Stars promi&s;ed to him,</HI> and <HI>that He was the
Darling of the People, who had &s;et their Hearts and Affections and all their
Hopes upon his Highne&s;s,</HI> with many other fooli&s;h and &s;ome &s;u&s;tian Expre&s;|&s;ions.
His Maje&s;ty told him in what Places the Duke had been &s;ince He left
<HI>London;</HI> &startq;that He &s;tayed few Days in any Place; and that He intended on
&s;uch a Day, that was to come, to be in <HI>Stafford&s;hire</HI> at the Hou&s;e of Sir<MILESTONE N="50">

Council, and one of tho&s;e who had been &s;ent by the Hou&s;e of Com|mons
to per&s;uade him to accept the Crown with the Title of King. Upon
<PB N="431" REF="437">
the whole Matter his Maje&s;ty a&s;ked him, &startq;what Way He was to proceed
again&s;t him:&endq; To which He an&s;wered, &startq;that He was fir&s;t to be appre|hended;
and when He &s;hould be in Cu&s;tody and examined, his Maje&s;ty
would better judge which Way He was to proceed again&s;t him.&endq;</P>
<P>UPON farther Con&s;ideration with the Chancellor and Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> and
others of the Council,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King i&s;|&s;ues out his Warrant to apprehend him.</NOTE> the King &s;ent a Sergeant at Arms, with a Warrant
under his Sign Manual, &startq;to apprehend the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and to bring
him before one of the Secretaries of State, to an&s;wer to &s;uch Crimes as &s;hould
be objected again&s;t him;&endq; or to that Purpo&s;e. The Sergeant made a Journey
<MILESTONE N="10">into <HI>Northampton&s;hire,</HI> where He was informed the Duke was: But &s;till, when
He came to the Hou&s;e where He was &s;aid to be, it was pretended that He
was gone from thence &s;ome Hours before; by which He found that He had
Notice of his Bu&s;ine&s;s. And therefore He concealed him&s;elf, and appointed
&s;ome Men to watch and inform them&s;elves of his Motions, it being generally
reported that He would be at the Hou&s;e of the Earl of <HI>Exeter</HI> at &s;uch a
Time. And Notice was given him, that He was then in a Coach with
Ladies going to that Hou&s;e: Upon which He made &s;o good Ha&s;te, that He
was in View of the Coach, and &s;aw the Duke alight out of the Coach, and
lead a Lady into the Hou&s;e; upon which the Door of the Court was &s;hut
<MILESTONE N="20">before He could get to it. He knocked loudly at that and other Doors
that were all &s;hut; &s;o that He could not get into the Hou&s;e, though it
were &s;ome Hours before Sun&s;et in the Month of <HI>May.</HI> After &s;ome Hours
Attendance, one Mr. <HI>Fairfax,</HI> who wa$ted upon the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI>
came to the Door, and without opening it a&s;ked him, &startq;what He would
have:&endq; And He an&s;wered, &startq;that He had a Me&s;&s;age to the Duke from
the King, and that He mu&s;t &s;peak with him;&endq; to which He replied,
that He was not there, and that He &s;hould &s;eek for him in &s;ome other
Place.&endq; The Sergeant told him, &startq;that He &s;aw him go into the Hou&s;e;
and that if He might not be admitted to &s;peak with him, He would re|quire
<MILESTONE N="30">the Sheriff of the County to give him his A&s;&s;i&s;tance:&endq; Upon which
the Gentleman went away, and about Half an Hour after returned again,
and threatened the Sergeant &s;o much, after He had opened the Door, that
the poor Man had not the Courage to &s;tay longer; but returned to the
Court, and gave a full Relation in Writing to the Secretary of the Endea|vours
He had u&s;ed, and the Affronts He had received.</P>
<P>WHY all the particular Circum&s;tances of this Affair are &s;o punctually re|lated,
will appear anon.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is removed from all his Employments.</NOTE> The King was &s;o exceedingly offended at this
Carriage and Behaviour of the Duke, that He made Relation of it to the
Council-Board, and publickly declared, &startq;that He was no longer of that
<MILESTONE N="40">Number,&endq; and cau&s;ed his Name to be left out in the Li&s;t of the Coun|&s;ellors,
and &startq;that He was no longer a Gentleman of his Bedchamber,&endq; and
put the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> to wait in his Place. His Maje&s;ty likewi&s;e revoked
that Commi&s;&s;ion by which He was con&s;tituted Lord Lieutenant of the Ea&s;t
Riding in <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> and granted that Commi&s;&s;ion to the Earl of <HI>Burling|ton:</HI>
So that it was not po&s;&s;ible for his Maje&s;ty to give more lively In&s;tances
of his Di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t any Man, than He had done again&s;t the Duke.
And at the &s;ame Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Proclama|tion for ap|prehending him.</NOTE> with the Advice of the Board, a Proclamation i&s;&s;ued
out for his Apprehen&s;ion, and inhibiting all Per&s;ons to entertain, receive or

<MILESTONE N="50">that He &s;hould be le&s;s di&s;covered in <HI>London,</HI> whither He re&s;orted, and had
many Lodgings in &s;everal Quarters of the City. And though his Maje&s;ty had
frequent Intelligence where He was, and continued Adverti&s;ements of the

which He was no le&s;s &s;en&s;ible; yet when the Sergeant at Arms, and others
employed for his Apprehen&s;ion, came where He was known to have been
but an Hour before, He was gone from thence, or &s;o concealed there that
He could not be found: And in this Manner He continued &s;leeping all the
Day, and walking from Place to Place in the Night, for the Space of &s;ome
Months.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t being adverti&s;ed of renewed In&s;tances of the King's Di&s;plea&s;ure,
and that it every Day increa&s;ed upon new Intelligence that He received of
his Behaviour, He grew weary of the Po&s;ture He was in, and employed &s;e|veral
Per&s;ons to move the King on his Behalf; for He was informed that<MILESTONE N="10">
the King re&s;olved to proceed again&s;t him for his Life, and that his E&s;tate
was begged and given.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke de|&s;ires the Chan+cellor to inter+po&s;e in his Be|half.</NOTE> Upon this one Night He &s;ent his Secretary, Mr.
<HI>Clifford,</HI> to the Chancellor, with whom He had never entered into any Di&s;|pute,
with &s;ome Compliments and Expre&s;&s;ions of Confidence in his Friend|&s;hip.
He profe&s;&s;ed &startq;great Innocence and Integrity in all his Actions with
Reference to the King, though He might have been pa&s;&s;ionate and in|di&s;creet
in his Words; that there was a Con&s;piracy again&s;t his Life, and
that his E&s;tate was granted or promi&s;ed to Per&s;ons who had begged it:&endq;
And in Conclu&s;ion He de&s;ired &startq;that He would &s;end him his Advice what
He &s;hould do, but rather, that He would permit him to come to him<MILESTONE N="20">
in the Evening to his Hou&s;e that He might confer with him.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Chancellor an&s;wered his Secretary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel|lor's Advice to him.</NOTE> who was well known to him, &startq;that
He might not confer with him till He rendered him&s;elf to the King; that
He was confident, having &s;een Te&s;timony enough to convince him, that the
Duke was not innocent; and that He had much to an&s;wer for dire&s;pectful
Mention of the King, which would require much Acknowledgement and
Submi&s;&s;ion: But that He did not know that his Crimes were of that Mag|nitude
as would put his Life into Danger; and that He was mo&s;t confi|dent
that there was no Con&s;piracy to take that from him, except his Faults
were of another Nature than they yet appeared to be; and which no<MILESTONE N="30">
Con&s;piracy, which He need not fear, could deprive him of. And He did
not believe that there had been any Attempt to beg his E&s;tate: But He
was &s;ure there had not been, nor could be, any Grant of it to any Man,
which mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed by the Great Seal.&endq; He did advi&s;e him, and de|&s;ired
him to follow his Advice, &startq;that if He did know him&s;elf innocent as
to unlawful Actions and De&s;igns, and that his Fault con&s;i&s;ted only in in|di&s;creet
Words, as He &s;eemed to confe&s;s; He would no longer aggravate
his Offence by contemning his Warrants, which He would not be long
able to avoid, but deliver him&s;elf into the Cu&s;tody of the Lieutenant of
the <HI>Tower,</HI> which He was at Liberty by the Proclamation to do, and &s;end<MILESTONE N="40">
then a Petition to the King, that He might be heard: And that when
He had done this, He would be ready and willing to do him all the Of|fices
which would con&s;i&s;t with his Duty.&endq;</P>
<P>AND the next Day He gave his Maje&s;ty a particular Account of the Me&s;|&s;age
which He had received, and of the An&s;wer which He had returned;
which his Maje&s;ty approved, and &s;hewed him a Letter that He had received
from the Duke that Morning, which &s;eemed to have been written after his
Secretary had returned from the Chancellor. The Letter contained a large
Profe&s;&s;ion of his Innocence, and Complaint of the Power of his Enemies,
and a very earne&s;t De&s;ire &startq;that his Maje&s;ty would give him Leave to &s;peak<MILESTONE N="50">
with him, and then di&s;po&s;e of him as He plea&s;ed;&endq; to which his Maje&s;ty
had an&s;wered to the Per&s;on who brought the Letter, who, as I remember,
<PB N="433" REF="439">
was Sir <HI>Robert Howard,</HI> &startq;that the Duke need not fear the Power of any
Enemies, but would be &s;ure to have Ju&s;tice if He would &s;ubmit to it.&endq;</P>
<P>BUT his Maje&s;ty in his Di&s;cour&s;e &s;eemed to be as weary of the Pro&s;ecu|tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King grows weary of the Pro&s;e|cution.</NOTE>
as the Duke was of the concealing him&s;elf to avoid it, and to have
much Apprehen&s;ion of his Intere&s;t and Power in the Parliament; and to be
troubled that the principal Witne&s;s, upon who&s;e Te&s;timony He relied, was
at that Time &s;ick of the Smallpox, and in Danger of Death, and that
another retracted Part of that Evidence that He had given. In a Word;
his Maje&s;ty appeared le&s;s angry than He had been, and willing that an End
<MILESTONE N="10">&s;hould be put to the Bu&s;ine&s;s without any publick Pro&s;ecution. To which
the Chancellor made no other An&s;wer, than &startq;that no Advice could be
given with Pre&s;ervation of his Maje&s;ty's Dignity, till the Duke rendered
him&s;elf into the Hand of Ju&s;tice:&endq; Which He was very unwilling to do,
and &s;ent again to the Chancellor by Sir <HI>Robert Howard,</HI> to pre&s;s him, &startq;that
He might be admitted fir&s;t to the King's Pre&s;ence, and then &s;ent to the
<HI>Tower.</HI>&endq; The other told him, &startq;that if the King were inclined to admit
him in that Manner, He would di&s;&s;uade him from it, as a Thing di&s;ho|nourable
to him after &s;o long a Conte&s;t;&endq; and repeated the &s;ame to him
that He &s;aid formerly to Mr. <HI>Clifford:</HI> Nor could He be per&s;uaded by any
<MILESTONE N="20">others (for others did &s;peak to him to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e) to recede a Tittle
from what He had in&s;i&s;ted upon, &startq;that He &s;hould put him&s;elf in the
<HI>Tower.</HI>&endq; In all which He &s;till gave the King a faithful Account of every
Word that pa&s;&s;ed: For He knew well that the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> endeavoured
to per&s;uade the King, &startq;that the Chancellor favoured the Duke, and de|&s;ired
that He &s;hould be at Liberty;&endq; when at the &s;ame Time He u&s;ed all
the Ways He could to have it in&s;inuated to the Duke's Friends, &startq;that He
knew Nothing of the Bu&s;ine&s;s, but that the whole Pro&s;ecution was made
by the Information and Advice of the Chancellor.&endq;</P>
<P>IN the End, the Duke was per&s;uaded to render him&s;elf to the <HI>Tower:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke &s;ur|renders him|&s;elf.</NOTE>
<MILESTONE N="30">And from thence He &s;ent a Petition to the King, who pre&s;ently appeared
very well inclined to give over any farther Pro&s;ecution; which Alteration
all Men wondered at, nor could any Man imagine the Ground or Rea&s;on
of it. For though the principal Witne&s;s was dead, as the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI>
declared He was, and that &s;o much could not be proved as at the fir&s;t
Di&s;covery was rea&s;onably &s;u&s;pected; yet the Meanne&s;s and Vilene&s;s of the
Per&s;ons with whom He kept &s;o familiar Corre&s;pondence, the Letters between
them which were ready to be produced, the di&s;re&s;pectful and &s;candalous
Di&s;cour&s;es which He often held concerning the King's Per&s;on, and many
other Particulars which had mo&s;t inflamed the King, and which might fully
<MILESTONE N="40">have been proved, would have manife&s;ted &s;o much Vanity and Pre&s;ump|tion
in the Duke, as mu&s;t have le&s;&s;ened his Credit and Reputation with all
&s;erious Men, and made him worthy of &s;evere Cen&s;ure. But whether the
King thought not fit to proceed upon the Words and &s;candalous Di&s;cour&s;es,
which He thought would more di&s;per&s;e and publi&s;h the Scandals; or whe|ther
He did really believe that it would di&s;turb and ob&s;truct all his Bu&s;ine&s;s
in Parliament; or what other Rea&s;on &s;oever prevailed with his Maje&s;ty, as
without Doubt &s;ome other there were: His Maje&s;ty was very impatient to be
rid of the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and would have been ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to have given pre|&s;ent
Order for &s;etting the Duke at Liberty, and &s;o to &s;ilence all farther Di&s;|cour&s;e.
<MILESTONE N="50">But He was per&s;uaded, &startq;that that would mo&s;t reflect upon his own
Honour, by making it believed, that there had been in Truth a foul Con|&s;piracy
again&s;t the Per&s;on of the Duke, which would give him more Credit
in the Parliament and every where el&s;e;&endq; for the King had not yet, with

all his Indulgence, a better Opinion of his Affection and Fidelity than He
had before.</P>
<P>IN Conclu&s;ion;<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is exa|mined at the Council-Board.</NOTE> it was re&s;olved, &startq;that the Lieutenant of the <HI>Tower</HI> &s;hould
bring the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> to the Council-Chamber, his Maje&s;ty being
pre&s;ent; and there the Attorney and Solicitor General &s;hould open the
Charge that was again&s;t him, and read all the Examinations which had
been taken, and the Letters which had pa&s;&s;ed between them:&endq; All which
was done. And the Duke denying &startq;that He had ever written to that
Fellow, though He knew him well, and u&s;ed to make him&s;elf merry
with him,&endq; the Letter was produced (which the King and the Lord <HI>Ar|lington,</HI><MILESTONE N="10">
who Both knew his Hand well, made no Doubt to be his Hand)
and delivered to the Duke; who, as &s;oon as He ca&s;t his Eye upon it, &s;aid, &startq;it
was not his Hand, but He well knew who&s;e it was.&endq; And being a&s;ked who&s;e
Hand it was, He &s;aid, &startq;it was his Si&s;ter's, the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Richmond,</HI> with
whom,&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;it was known that He had no Corre&s;pondence.&endq;
Whereupon the King called for the Letter, and, having looked upon it, He
&s;aid, &startq;He had been mi&s;taken,&endq; and confe&s;&s;ed &startq;that it was the Dutche&s;s's
Hand;&endq; and &s;eemed much out of Countenance upon the Mi&s;take:
Though the Letter gave &s;till as much Cau&s;e of Su&s;picion, for it was as
&s;trange that She &s;hould write to &s;uch a Fellow in a Style very obliging, and<MILESTONE N="20">
in An&s;wer to a Letter; &s;o that it &s;eemed very rea&s;onable &s;till to believe, that
She might have written it upon his De&s;ire and dictating.</P>
<P>THE Duke denied mo&s;t of the Particulars contained in the Examinations:
And for the other Letters which had been written to him by the Fellow who
was in the <HI>Tower</HI> (whereof one was found in his Pocket &s;ealed to be &s;ent to the
Duke, and the others were Copies of others which had been &s;ent; and the
Witne&s;s who was dead had delivered one of them into the Duke's own
Hand, and related at large the Kindne&s;s He expre&s;&s;ed towards the Man,
and the Me&s;&s;age He &s;ent to him by him), He denied that He had ever re|ceived
tho&s;e Letters; but acknowledged, &startq;that the Man came often to him,<MILESTONE N="30">
and pretended Skill in Horo&s;copes, but more in Di&s;tillations, in which the
Duke delighted and exerci&s;ed him&s;elf, but looked upon the Fellow as

withdrawn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King ea|&s;ily &s;atisfied with his De|fence.</NOTE> the King declared, &startq;that He had been deceived in being con|fident
that the Letter had been written by the Duke, which He now di&s;|cerned
not to be his Hand, and He knew as well to have been written

el&s;e worth the examining: And &s;o Order was given to &s;et the Duke
at Liberty, who immediately went to his own Hou&s;e, and went not in &s;ome
Days afterwards to the Court.<MILESTONE N="40"></P>
<P>ABOUT this Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel|lor lo&s;es his Wife.</NOTE> or in few Days afterwards, a great Affliction befell the

His Wife, the Mother of all his Children, and his Companion in all
his Bani&s;hment, and who had made all his former Calamities le&s;s grievous by
her Company and Courage, having made a Journey to <HI>Tunbridge</HI> for her
Health, returned from thence without the Benefit She expected, yet without
being thought by the Phy&s;icians to be in any Danger; and within le&s;s than
three Days died: Which was &s;o &s;udden, unexpected and irreparable a Lo&s;s
that He had not Courage to &s;upport; which Nobody wondered at who knew<MILESTONE N="50">

<P><PB N="435" REF="441">
WITHIN few Days after his Wife's Death, the King vouch&s;afed to come
to his Hou&s;e to condole with him, and u&s;ed many gracious Expre&s;&s;ions to

much Trouble told him, &startq;that &s;uch a Day, that was pa&s;t, walking with

To which his Highne&s;s had made An&s;wer, <HI>that He was the mo&s;t di&s;con&s;olate
Per&s;on He ever &s;aw; and that He had lamented him&s;elf to him not only
upon the Lo&s;s of his Wife, but out of Apprehen&s;ion that his Maje&s;ty had of
<MILESTONE N="10">late withdrawn his Countenance from him;</HI> to which his Maje&s;ty replied,
<HI>that He wondered He &s;hould think &s;o, but that He would &s;peak more to him
of that Subject the next Day.</HI> And that that Morning his Maje&s;ty had held
a long Di&s;cour&s;e with him, in which He told him, <HI>that He had received
very particular and certain Intelligence, that when the Parliament &s;hould meet
again They were re&s;olved to impeach the Chancellor, who was grown very
odious to them, not only for his having oppo&s;ed them in all tho&s;e Things upon
which They had &s;et their Hearts, but that They had been informed that He
had propo&s;ed and advi&s;ed their Di&s;&s;olution; which had enraged them to that
Degree, that They had taken a Re&s;olution as &s;oon as They came together again
<MILESTONE N="20">to &s;end up an Impeachment again&s;t him; which would be a great Di&s;honour
to his Maje&s;ty and ob&s;truct all his Affairs, nor &s;hould He be able to protect
him or divert them: And therefore that it would be nece&s;&s;ary for his Ser|vice,
and likewi&s;e for the Pre&s;ervation of the Chancellor, that He &s;hould de|liver
up the Seal to him.</HI> All which He de&s;ired the Duke&endq; (who confe&s;&s;ed
that He had likewi&s;e received the &s;ame Adverti&s;ement) &startq;to inform him of:
And <HI>that the Chancellor him&s;elf &s;hould choo&s;e the Way and the Manner of
delivering up the Seal, whether He would wait upon the King and give it
into his own Hand, or whether the King &s;hould &s;end a Secretary or a Privy
Coun&s;ellor for it.</HI>&endq; When the Duke had &s;aid all that the King had given
<MILESTONE N="30">him in Charge, He declared him&s;elf &startq;to be much un&s;atisfied with the
King's Re&s;olution; and that though He had received the &s;ame Adver|ti&s;ement,
and believed that there was a real Combination and Con&s;piracy
again&s;t him, yet He knew the Chancellor's Innocence would not be frighted
with it.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Chancellor was indeed as much &s;urpri&s;ed with this Relation, as He
could have been at the Sight of a Warrant for his Execution. He told the
Duke, &startq;that He did not wonder that the King and his Highne&s;s had been
informed of &s;uch a Re&s;olution; for that They who had contrived the
Con&s;piracy, and done all They could to make it prevalent, could be&s;t in|form
<MILESTONE N="40">his Maje&s;ty and his Highne&s;s of what would probably fall out.&endq; And
thereupon He informed the Duke &startq;of what had pa&s;&s;ed at the Day of the
la&s;t Prorogation, and the Di&s;cour&s;e and Promi&s;e Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> had
made to them, if They had a Mind to be rid of the Chancellor: But,&endq;
He &s;aid, &startq;that which only afflicted him was, that the King &s;hould have no
better Opinion of his Innocence and Integrity, than to conclude that &s;uch
a Combination mu&s;t ruin him. And He was more troubled to find, that
the King him&s;elf had &s;o terrible an Apprehen&s;ion of their Power and
their Purpo&s;es, as if They might do any Thing They had a Mind to do.
He did not believe that He was &s;o odious to the Parliament as He was
<MILESTONE N="50">reported to be; if He were, it was only for his Zeal to his Maje&s;ty's Ser|vice,
and his in&s;i&s;ting upon what his Maje&s;ty had re&s;olved: But He was
confident that when his Enemies had done all that their Malice could
&s;ugge&s;t again&s;t him, it would appear that the Parliament was not of their
<PB N="436" REF="442">
Mind. He wi&s;hed that He might have the Honour to &s;peak with the
King, before He returned any An&s;wer to his Commands.&endq; The Duke
was plea&s;ed graciou&s;ly to reply, &startq;that it was the Advice He intended to
give him, that He &s;hould de&s;ire it; and that He doubted not but that He
&s;hould ea&s;ily prevail with the King to come to his Hou&s;e, whither He had
u&s;ed &s;o frequently to come, and where He had been &s;o few Days before:&endq;
And at this Time the Chancellor was not well able to walk; be&s;ides that it
was again&s;t the common Rules of Decency to go &s;o &s;oon out of his Hou&s;e.
When the Duke de&s;ired the King, that He would vouch&s;afe to go to <HI>Cla|rendon-Hou&s;e;</HI>
his Maje&s;ty very readily con&s;ented to it, and &s;aid, &startq;He would<MILESTONE N="10">
go thither the next Day.&endq; But that and more Days pa&s;&s;ed: And then He
told the Duke, &startq;that &s;ince He re&s;olved to take the Seal, it would not be
&s;o fit for him to go thither; but He would &s;end for the Chancellor to
come to his own Chamber in <HI>Whitehall,</HI> and He would go thither
to him.&endq;</P>
<P>IN the mean Time it began to be the Di&s;cour&s;e of the Court: And the
Dutche&s;s, from whom the Duke had yet concealed it, came to be informed
of it; who pre&s;ently went to the King with &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ion; and the Arch|bi&s;hop
of <HI>Canterbury</HI> and the General accompanied her,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Many Per&s;ons of Eminence interpo&s;e on his Behalf.</NOTE> who all befought
the King not to take &s;uch a Re&s;olution. And many other of the Privy<MILESTONE N="20">
Council, with none of whom the Chancellor had &s;poken, taking Notice of
the Rumour, attended the King with the &s;ame Suit and Advice. To all
whom his Maje&s;ty an&s;wered, &startq;that what He intended was for his Good,
and the only Way to pre&s;erve him.&endq; He held longer Di&s;cour&s;e to the Ge|neral,
&startq;that He did believe by what his Brother had told him, of the ex|treme
Agony the Chancellor was in upon the Death of his Wife, that He
had him&s;elf de&s;ired to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his Office;&endq; and bade the Ge|neral
&startq;go to him, and bid him come the next Morning to his own Cham|ber
at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> and the King would come thither to him.&endq; And the
General came to him with great Profe&s;&s;ions of Kindne&s;s, which He had<MILESTONE N="30">
well de&s;erved from him, gave him a Relation of all that had pa&s;&s;ed with
the King, and concluded, &startq;that what had been done had been upon Mi&s;|take;
and He doubted not, but that upon Conference with his Maje&s;ty
all Things would be well &s;ettled again to his Content;&endq; which no Doubt
He did at that Time believe as well as wi&s;h.</P>
<P>UPON <HI>Monday,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Chancel|lor attends the King at</HI> Whitehall.</NOTE> the twenty &s;ixth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> about Ten of the Clock in the
Morning, the Chancellor went to his Chamber in <HI>Whitehall,</HI> where He had
not been many Minutes, before the King and Duke by them&s;elves came
into the Room. His Maje&s;ty looked very graciou&s;ly upon him, and made
him &s;it down;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conference be|tween them.</NOTE> when the other acknowledged &startq;the Honour his Maje&s;ty had<MILESTONE N="40">
done him, in admitting him into his Pre&s;ence before He executed a Re|&s;olution
He had taken.&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;that He had no Suit to make to
him, nor the lea&s;t Thought to di&s;pute with him, or to divert him from
the Re&s;olution He had taken; but only to receive his Determination from
him&s;elf, and mo&s;t humbly to be&s;eech him to let him know what Fault He
had committed, that had drawn this Severity upon him from his Maje&s;ty.&endq;
The King told him, &startq;He had not any Thing to object again&s;t him; but mu&s;t
always acknowledge, that He had always &s;erved him hone&s;tly and faith|fully,
and that He did believe that never King had a better Servant: And
that He had taken this Re&s;olution for his Good and Pre&s;ervation, as well<MILESTONE N="50">
as for his own Convenience and Security; and that He had verily believed
that it had been upon his Con&s;ent and De&s;ire.&endq; And thereupon his Ma|je&s;ty
entered upon a Relation of all that had pa&s;&s;ed between him and the
<PB N="437" REF="443">
Duke, and &startq;that He really thought his Brother had concurred with him in
his Opinion, as the only Way to pre&s;erve him.&endq; In that Di&s;cour&s;e the
Duke &s;ometimes po&s;itively denied to have &s;aid Somewhat, and explained other
Things as not &s;aid to the Purpo&s;e his Maje&s;ty under&s;tood, or that He ever
implied that him&s;elf thought it fit.</P>
<P>THE Sum of what his Maje&s;ty &s;aid was, &startq;that He was mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured by
Information that could not deceive him, that the Parliament was re&s;olved,
as &s;oon as They &s;hould come together again, to impeach the Chancellor;
and then that his Innocence would no more defend and &s;ecure him again&s;t
<MILESTONE N="10">their Power, than the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> had defended him&s;elf again&s;t them:
And,&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;He was as &s;ure, that his taking the Seal from him at
this Time would &s;o well plea&s;e the Parliament, that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould
thereby be able to pre&s;erve him, and to provide for the Pa&s;&s;age of his own
Bu&s;ine&s;s, and the obtaining all that He de&s;ired.&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;He was &s;orry
that the Bu&s;ine&s;s had taken &s;o much Air, and was &s;o publickly &s;poken of,
that He knew not how to change his Purpo&s;e;&endq; Which He &s;eemed to
impute to the Pa&s;&s;ion of the Dutche&s;s, that had divulged it.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor told him, &startq;that He had not contributed to the Noi&s;e,
nor had imparted it to his own Children, till They with great Trouble
<MILESTONE N="20">informed him, that They heard it from &s;uch and &s;uch Per&s;ons,&endq; whom
They named, &startq;with &s;ome Complaint that it was concealed from them:
Nor did He then come in Hope to divert him from the Re&s;olution He had
taken in the Matter it&s;elf.&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;He had but two Things to trou|ble
him with. The fir&s;t, that He would by no Means &s;uffer it to be be|lieved
that He him&s;elf was willing to deliver up the Seal; and that He
&s;hould not think him&s;elf a Gentleman, if He were willing to depart and
withdraw him&s;elf from the Office, in a Time when He thought his Ma|je&s;ty
would have Need of all hone&s;t Men, and in which He thought He
might be able to do him &s;ome Service. The &s;econd, that He could not
<MILESTONE N="30">acknowledge this Deprivation to be done in his Favour, or in Order to do
him Good; but on the Contrary, that He looked upon it as the greate&s;t
Ruin He could undergo, by his Maje&s;ty's own declaring his Judgment
upon him, which would amount to little le&s;s than a Confirmation of
tho&s;e many libellous Di&s;cour&s;es which had been rai&s;ed, and would upon
the Matter expo&s;e him to the Rage and Fury of the People, who had been
with great Artifice and Indu&s;try per&s;uaded to believe, that He had been
the Cau&s;e and the Coun&s;ellor of all that They liked not. That He was &s;o
far from fearing the Ju&s;tice of the Parliament, that He renounced his Ma|je&s;ty's
Protection or Interpo&s;ition towards his Pre&s;ervation: And that though
<MILESTONE N="40">the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> had undergone a Sentence He did not de&s;erve,
yet He could not acknowledge their Ca&s;es to be parallel. That though
that great Per&s;on had never committed any Offence that could amount
to Trea&s;on, yet He had done many Things which He could not ju&s;tify,
and which were Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions again&s;t the Law: Whereas He was not
guilty of any Action, whereof He did not de&s;ire the Law might be the
Judge. And if his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf &s;hould di&s;cover all that He had &s;aid
to him in Secret, He feared not any Cen&s;ure that &s;hould attend it: If any
Body could charge him with any Crime or Offence, He would mo&s;t wil|lingly
undergo the Puni&s;hment that belonged to it.&endq;</P>
<MILESTONE N="50">
<P>&startq;BUT,&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;He doubted very much, that the throwing off
an old Servant, who had &s;erved the Crown in &s;ome Tru&s;t near thirty
Years (who had the Honour by the Command of his ble&s;&s;ed Father, who
had left good Evidence of the E&s;teem He had of his Fidelity, to wait
<PB N="438" REF="444">
upon his Maje&s;ty when He went out of the Kingdom, and by the great
Ble&s;&s;ing of God had the Honour to return with him again; which no
other Coun&s;ellor alive could &s;ay), on the Sudden, without any Sugge&s;tion
of a Crime, nay with a Declaration of Innocence, would call his Ma|je&s;ty's
Ju&s;tice and good Nature into Que&s;tion; and Men would not know
how &s;ecurely to &s;erve him, when They &s;hould &s;ee it was in the Power of
three or four Per&s;ons who had never done him any notable Service, nor
were in the Opinion of tho&s;e who knew them be&s;t like to do, to di&s;po&s;e
him to &s;o ungracious an Act.&endq;</P>
<P>THE King &s;eemed very much troubled and irre&s;olute; then repeated<MILESTONE N="10">
&startq;the great Power of the Parliament, and the clear Information He had of
their Purpo&s;es, which They were re&s;olved to go through with right or
wrong; and that his own Condition was &s;uch, that He could not di&s;pute
with them, but was upon the Matter at their Mercy.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Chancellor told him, &startq;it was not po&s;&s;ible for his Maje&s;ty to have
any probable A&s;&s;urance what the Parliament would do. And though He
knew He had offended &s;ome of the Hou&s;e of Commons, in oppo&s;ing their
De&s;ires in &s;uch Particulars as his Maje&s;ty thought were prejudicial to his
Service; yet He did not doubt but his Reputation was much greater in
Both Hou&s;es, than either of theirs who were known to be his Enemies,<MILESTONE N="20">
and to have this Influence upon his Maje&s;ty, who were all known to be
guilty of &s;ome Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, which They would have been called in
Que&s;tion for in Parliament, if He had not very indu&s;triou&s;ly, out of the
Tenderne&s;s He had for his Maje&s;ty's Honour and Service, prevented it;
Somewhat whereof was not unknown to his Maje&s;ty.&endq; He concluded
&startq;with be&s;eeching him, whatever Re&s;olution He took in his Particular, not
to &s;uffer his Spirits to fall, nor him&s;elf to be dejected with the Apprehen|&s;ion
of the formidable Power of the Parliament, which was more or le&s;s or
Nothing, as He plea&s;ed to make it: That it was yet in his own Power to
govern them; but if They found it was in theirs to govern him, Nobody<MILESTONE N="30">
knew what the End would be.&endq; And thereupon He made him a &s;hort
Relation of the Method that was u&s;ed in the Time of <HI>Richard</HI> the Second,
&startq;when They terrified the King with the Power and the Purpo&s;es of the
Parliament, till They brought him to con&s;ent to that from which He could
not redeem him&s;elf, and without which They could have done him no
Harm.&endq; And in the Warmth of this Relation He found a &s;ea&s;onable Op|portunity
to mention the Lady with &s;ome Reflections and Cautions, which
He might more advi&s;edly have declined.</P>
<P>AFTER two Hours Di&s;cour&s;e the King ro&s;e without &s;aying any Thing,
but appeared not well plea&s;ed with all that had been &s;aid;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King leaves him in Di&s;plea&s;ure.</NOTE> and the Duke<MILESTONE N="40">
of <HI>York</HI> found He was offended with the la&s;t Part of it. The Garden, that
u&s;ed to be private, had now many in it to ob&s;erve the Countenance of the
King when He came out of the Room: And when the Chancellor re|turned,
the Lady, the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> and Mr. <HI>May,</HI> looked together out
of her open Window with great Gaiety and Triumph, which all People
ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>FOUR or five Days pa&s;&s;ed without any farther Proceedings, or the King's
declaring his Re&s;olution: And in that Time the Chancellor's Concern was the
only Argument of the Court. Many of the Council, and other Per&s;ons of
Honour and Intere&s;t, pre&s;umed to &s;peak with the King, and to give a very<MILESTONE N="50">
good Te&s;timony of him, of his unque&s;tionable Integrity, and of his Parts,
and Credit with the &s;ober Part of the Nation: And to tho&s;e his Maje&s;ty
always commended him, with Profe&s;&s;ion of much Kindne&s;s; but &s;aid, &startq;He
<PB N="439" REF="445">
had made him&s;elf odious to the Parliament, and &s;o was no more capable
to do him Service.&endq; On the other Side the Lady and Lord <HI>Arlington</HI>
and Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> exceedingly triumphed, the la&s;t of which openly
and without Re&s;erve declared, &startq;that He had given the King Advice to remove
him as a Man odious to the Parliament, and that the King would be ruined
if He did it not; that He was &s;o imperious that He would endure no
Contradiction;&endq; with many other Reproaches to that Purpo&s;e. But except
tho&s;e three, and Mr. <HI>May</HI> and Mr. <HI>Brounker,</HI> there &s;eemed none of Name in
the Court who wi&s;hed that the Re&s;olution &s;hould be pur&s;ued.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10">THE Duke of <HI>York</HI> concerned him&s;elf wonderfully on the Chancellor's
Behalf,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Duke of</HI> York <HI>intere&s;ts him&s;elf on the Chancellor's Behalf.</HI></NOTE> and with as much Warmth as any private Gentleman could expre&s;s
on the Behalf of his Friend. He had great Indignation at the Behaviour of
Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> and Mr. <HI>Brounker,</HI> that being his Servants They &s;hould
pre&s;ume to &s;hew &s;o much Malice towards a Per&s;on They knew He had
Kindne&s;s for. And the former had &s;o much Sen&s;e of it, that He re&s;olved
to quit the Relation by which He had got va&s;t Wealth, and came to him,
and told him, &startq;that &s;ince He was Commi&s;&s;ioner for the Trea&s;ury, He found
He &s;hould not be able to attend his Service &s;o diligently as He ought to
do; and therefore de&s;ired his Highne&s;s's Favour in his Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, and
<MILESTONE N="20">that He would give him Leave to commend an hone&s;t Man to &s;ucceed him
in his Service:&endq; To which his Highne&s;s &s;hortly an&s;wered, &startq;that He might
di&s;po&s;e him&s;elf as He would, with which He was well content; and
that He would choo&s;e another Secretary for him&s;elf without his Recom|mendation.&endq;
And his Highne&s;s pre&s;ently went to the Chancellor, and
informed him of it, with Di&s;plea&s;ure enough towards the Man, and much
Satisfaction that He was rid of him; and a&s;ked him &startq;whom He would re|commend
to him for a Secretary.&endq; He told his Highne&s;s, &startq;that if He
would tru&s;t his Judgment, He would recommend a Per&s;on to him, who
He believed was not unknown to him, and for who&s;e Parts and Fidelity
<MILESTONE N="30">He would pa&s;s his Word, having had good Experience of Both in his
having &s;erved him as a Secretary for the Space of above &s;even Years;&endq; and
named Mr. <HI>Wren.</HI> The Duke &s;aid, &startq;He knew him well, being a Member
of the Royal Company, where He often heard him &s;peak very intelligently,
and di&s;cerned him to be a Man of very good Parts, and therefore He would
very willingly receive him; and the rather, that He knew it would be
looked upon as an Evidence of his Kindne&s;s to him, which He would
always own and te&s;tify to all the World:&endq; And within two Days after, He
received him into his Service with the King's Approbation, the Gentleman's
Abilities being very well known, and his Per&s;on much loved.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40">IN this Su&s;pen&s;ion, the common Argument was, &startq;that it was not now
the Que&s;tion whether the Chancellor was innocent; but whether, when
the King had &s;o long re&s;olved to remove him, and had now proceeded &s;o
far towards it, He &s;hould retract his Re&s;olution, and be governed by his
Brother: It was enough that He was not beloved, and that the Court
wi&s;hed him removed.&endq; And Mr. <HI>Brounker</HI> openly declared, &startq;that the
Re&s;olution had been taken above two Months before; and that it would
not con&s;i&s;t with his Maje&s;ty's Honour to be hectored out of it by his Bro|ther,
who was wrought upon by his Wife's Crying.&endq; And this Kind
of Argumentation was every Moment inculcated by the Lady and her Party:
<MILESTONE N="50">In&s;omuch as when the Duke made his In&s;tances with all the Importunity
He could u&s;e, and put his Maje&s;ty in Mind &startq;of many Di&s;cour&s;es his Ma|je&s;ty
had formerly held with him, of the Chancellor's Hone&s;ty and Di&s;|cretion,
conjuring him to love and e&s;teem him accordingly, when his
<PB N="440" REF="446">
Highne&s;s had not &s;o good an Opinion of him;&endq; and complained, &startq;that
now He had found by good Experience that He de&s;erved that Character,
his Maje&s;ty would withdraw his Kindne&s;s from him, and rather believe others,
who He knew were his Enemies, than his own Judgment:&endq; The King gave
no other An&s;wer, than &startq;that He had proceeded too far to retire; and that
He &s;hould be looked upon as a Child if He receded from his Purpo&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>AND &s;o being reconfirmed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Great Seal taken from the Chancellor.</NOTE> upon the thirtieth of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> in the Year 1667
He &s;ent Secretary <HI>Morrice,</HI> who had no Mind to the Employment, with a
Warrant under the Sign Manual, to require and receive the Great Seal;
which the Chancellor immediately delivered to him with all the Expre&s;&s;ions<MILESTONE N="10">
of Duty to the King. And as &s;oon as the Secretary had delivered it to the
King in his Clo&s;et, Mr. <HI>May</HI> went into the Clo&s;et, and fell upon his Knees,
and ki&s;&s;ed his Maje&s;ty's Hand, telling him &startq;that He was now King, which
He had never been before.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Chancellor believed that the Storm had been now over; for He had
not the lea&s;t Apprehen&s;ion of the Di&s;plea&s;ure of the Parliament, or of any
Thing They could &s;ay or do again&s;t him: Yet He re&s;olved to &s;tay at his
Hou&s;e till it &s;hould meet (without going thither, which He was informed
would be ill taken), that He might not be thought to be afraid of being
que&s;tioned; and then to retire into the Country, and to live there very pri|vately.<MILESTONE N="20">
And there was a Report rai&s;ed without any Ground, that He in|tended
to go to the Hou&s;e of Peers, and take his Precedence as Chancellor,
with which the King was much offended: But as &s;oon as He heard of it, He
de&s;ired the Lord Chamberlain to a&s;&s;ure his Maje&s;ty, &startq;that He never in|tended
any &s;uch Thing, nor would ever do any Thing that He believed
would di&s;plea&s;e him;&endq; with which He &s;eemed well &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>HOWEVER a new Tempe&s;t was quickly rai&s;ed again&s;t him. Many Per&s;ons
of Honour and Quality came every Day to vi&s;it him with many Expre&s;&s;ions
of Affection and E&s;teem; and mo&s;t of the King's Servants, except only
tho&s;e few who had declared them&s;elves his Enemies, &s;till frequented his<MILESTONE N="30">
Hou&s;e with the &s;ame Kindne&s;s They had always profe&s;&s;ed: But They were
looked upon quickly with a very ill Countenance by the other Party, and
were plainly told, &startq;that the King would take it ill from all his Servants who
vi&s;ited the Chancellor;&endq; though when &s;ome of them a&s;ked his Maje&s;ty,
&startq;whether their vi&s;iting him, to whom They had been formerly much be|holden,
would offend his Maje&s;ty;&endq; He an&s;wered, &startq;No, He had not
forbid any Man to vi&s;it him.&endq; Yet it appeared more every Day, that
They were be&s;t looked on who forbore going to him, and the other found
them&s;elves upon much Di&s;advantage; by which however many were not
di&s;couraged.<MILESTONE N="40"></P>
<P>THE chief Pro&s;ecutors behaved them&s;elves with more In&s;olence than was
agreeable to their Di&s;cretion: And the Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> who had long before
behaved him&s;elf with very little Courte&s;y towards all Per&s;ons whom He be|lieved
to be well affected to the Chancellor, even towards Amba&s;&s;adours
and other foreign Mini&s;ters, now when any of his Friends came to him for
the Di&s;patch of Bu&s;ine&s;s in his Office, a&s;ked them &startq;when They &s;aw the
Chancellor,&endq; and bade them &startq;go to him to put their Bu&s;ine&s;s into a Me|thod.&endq;
The Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who had after his Enlargement vi&s;ited
the Chancellor, and acknowledged the Civilities He had received from
him, came now again to the Court, and was received with extraordinary<MILESTONE N="50">
Grace by the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Duke of</HI> Buckingham <HI>re&s;tored to all his Employ|ments.</HI></NOTE> and re&s;tored to all the Honours and Offices of which
He was deprived; and was informed and a&s;&s;ured, &startq;that all the Proceedings
which had been again&s;t him were upon the Information and Advice of the
<PB N="441" REF="447">
Chancellor:&endq; And whatever He had &s;poken in Council was told him in
that Manner (and without the true Circum&s;tances) that might make mo&s;t
Impre&s;&s;ion on him.</P>
<P>ONE Day whil&s;t that Matter was depending (which is not mentioned be|fore)
the Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> after He found the King had acquainted the
Chancellor with the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;hewed him the Information and Exami|nations
which had been taken, propo&s;ed, there being more or the &s;ame Wit|ne&s;&s;es
to be farther examined, &startq;that the Chancellor might be pre&s;ent with
the re&s;t who had been formerly employed at their examining:&endq; Which the
<MILESTONE N="10">King &s;eeming to con&s;ent to, the other de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed, &startq;for that the
Office He held never u&s;ed to be &s;ubject to tho&s;e Employments;&endq; and in
the Debate added, &startq;that if the Te&s;timony of Witne&s;&s;es made good all that
was &s;ugge&s;ted, and the Duke &s;hould be brought to a Trial, it might pro|bably
fall out, that the King might command him to execute the Office
of High Steward, as He had lately done in the Trial of the Lord <HI>Morley;</HI>
and in that Re&s;pect it would be very incongruous for him to be pre&s;ent
at the Examinations.&endq;<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is inflamed again&s;t the Chancellor.</NOTE> The Duke was now informed, without any of
the Circum&s;tances, that the Chancellor had &s;aid that He was to be High
Steward at the Trial of the Duke.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20">THE Duke, who always believed, and could not but upon the Matter
know, that the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> (with whom He had Enmity) had been very
&s;olicitous in his Pro&s;ecution, had, after his having vi&s;ited the Chancellor,
&s;ent a Friend, whom He thought He would tru&s;t, to him &startq;to de&s;ire him to
deal freely with him concerning the Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> whom He knew to
be an Enemy to Both of them; and that He mu&s;t have him examined
upon that Con&s;piracy, which He hoped He would not take ill:&endq; To
which He an&s;wered, &startq;that He neither would nor could be examined con|cerning
any Thing that had been &s;aid or done in Council; but that He
would as his Friend, and to prevent his expo&s;ing him&s;elf to any new In|convenience,
<MILESTONE N="30">very freely and faithfully a&s;&s;ure him, that He did not be|lieve
that there had been any Con&s;piracy again&s;t him, nor did know that
the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> had done any Thing in the Pro&s;ecution, but what was
according to the Obligation and Duty of his Office; which Te&s;timony,&endq;
He &s;aid, &startq;could proceed only from Ju&s;tice, &s;ince He well knew that Lord
did not wi&s;h him well.&endq; This An&s;wer, it &s;eems, or the De&s;pair of draw|ing
any other from him to his Purpo&s;e, di&s;po&s;ed him to give entire Credit
to the other Information; and the King took great Pains to reconcile him
to the Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> who made many Vows to him of his future Service,
and de&s;ired his Protection:<NOTE PLACE="marg">And induced to concur in the Pro&s;ecution.</NOTE> And hereupon the Duke openly profe&s;&s;ed his
<MILESTONE N="40">Re&s;olution of Revenge, and frankly entered into the Combination with the

<P>BUT the Knowledge of all this did not give him much Trouble (&s;o much
Confidence He had in his own Innocence, and &s;o little E&s;teem of the Cre|dit
and Intere&s;t of his Enemies), until He heard that the King him&s;elf ex|pre&s;&s;ed
great Di&s;plea&s;ure towards him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King ex|pre&s;&s;es great Di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t the Chancellor.</NOTE> and declared &startq;that He had mi&s;be|haved

would endure no Contradiction; that He had a Faction in the Hou&s;e of
Commons, that oppo&s;ed every Thing that concerned his Maje&s;ty's Service,
if it were not recommended to them by him; and that He had given him
<MILESTONE N="50">very ill Advice concerning the Parliament, which offended him mo&s;t:&endq;
All which They to whom his Maje&s;ty &s;aid it divulged to others, that They
might thereby le&s;&s;en the Chancellor's Credit and Intere&s;t. It is very true,
They who had taken all Advantages to alienate the King's Affections from
<PB N="442" REF="448">
him, had at fir&s;t only propo&s;ed his Removal &startq;as a Per&s;on odious to the
Parliament, and whom They were re&s;olved to impeach, which would put
his Maje&s;ty into a Streight, either to renounce and de&s;ert an old Servant,
which would not be for his Honour, or, by protecting him, to deprive
him&s;elf of all tho&s;e Benefits which He expected from the Parliament;
whereas the removing him would &s;o gratify the Hou&s;es, that They would
deny Nothing that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould demand of them;&endq; and his Maje&s;ty
did believe it the only Way to pre&s;erve him. But when They had prevailed
&s;o far, and rendered them&s;elves more nece&s;&s;ary to him, They pro&s;ecuted
what They had begun with more vi&s;ible Animo&s;ity, and told him, &startq;that<MILESTONE N="10">
if the Parliament &s;u&s;pected that his Maje&s;ty retained &s;till any Kindne&s;s to|wards
him, They would not be &s;atisfied with his Removal, but appre|hend
that He would be again received into his Favour; and He would in
the mean Time have &s;o much Credit in Both Hou&s;es, e&s;pecially if He
&s;ate in the Hou&s;e of Peers,&endq; which They undertook to know He intended
to do, &startq;that He would be able to ob&s;truct what&s;oever his Maje&s;ty de&s;ired:
And therefore it was nece&s;&s;ary that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould upon all Occa&s;ions
declare, and that it &s;hould be believed, that He had &s;o full a Prejudice
again&s;t him, that Nobody &s;hould have Cau&s;e to fear, that He would ever
again be received into any Tru&s;t.&endq; And this di&s;po&s;ed his Maje&s;ty to di&s;|cour&s;e<MILESTONE N="20">
to many in that Manner that is before &s;et down.</P>
<P>AND when the Duke of <HI>York</HI> lamented to his Maje&s;ty the Reports which
were generally &s;pread abroad, of the Di&s;cour&s;es which He made to many
Per&s;ons of the Chancellor's Mi&s;behaviour towards him&s;elf, and his own Di&s;|plea&s;ure
again&s;t him; the King denied many of the Particulars, as that
concerning his ill Coun&s;el again&s;t the Parliament, which He denied to have
&s;poken: But &s;aid withal, &startq;that if the Chancellor had done as He advi&s;ed
him, and delivered up the Seal to him as of his own Inclination, all
would have been quiet. But &s;ince He in&s;i&s;ted &s;o much upon it, and
compelled him to &s;end for it in that Manner, He was obliged in the<MILESTONE N="30">
Vindication of his Honour to give &s;ome Rea&s;ons for what He had done,
when other Men took upon them &s;o loudly to commend the Chancellor,
and to ju&s;tify his Innocence, not without &s;ome Reflection upon his own
Honour and Ju&s;tice, which He could not but take very ill: But He &s;hould
not &s;uffer&endq; (He &s;aid) &startq;for what other Men did, and that He would u&s;e
his two Sons as kindly as ever He had done.&endq; And it mu&s;t be always
acknowledged, that though great Importunity was u&s;ed to his Maje&s;ty to
di&s;charge his two Sons from his Service, as a Thing nece&s;&s;ary by all the Rules
of Policy, not to &s;uffer the Sons to remain &s;o near his Per&s;on, when their
Father lay under &s;o notorious a Brand of his Di&s;plea&s;ure (in which They be|lieved<MILESTONE N="40">
They had &s;o far prevailed, that They took upon them to promi&s;e their
Places to other Men); yet the King po&s;itively refu&s;ed to yield to them, and
continued his Favour &s;till to them Both in the &s;ame Manner He had done.
And though He was long after per&s;uaded to &s;u&s;pend his elde&s;t Son from
waiting, under which Cloud He continued for many Months, yet at la&s;t He
was re&s;tored to his Place with Circum&s;tances of extraordinary Favour and
Grace: Nor did his Maje&s;ty afterwards recede from his Goodne&s;s towards
either of them, notwith&s;tanding all the Attempts which were made.</P>
<P>THE Parliament met upon the tenth of <HI>October,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment meets: The King re|flects on the Chancellor.</NOTE> when the King in a &s;hort
Speech told them, &startq;that there had been &s;ome former Mi&s;carriages, which had<MILESTONE N="50">
occa&s;ioned &s;ome Differences between him and them: But that He had now
altered his Coun&s;els, and made no Que&s;tion but that They &s;hould hence|forward
agree, for He was re&s;olved to give them all Satisfaction; and did
<PB N="443" REF="449">
not doubt but that They would &s;upply his Nece&s;&s;ities, and provide for
the Payment of his Debts;&endq; with an In&s;inuation, &startq;that what had been
formerly done ami&s;s had been by the Advice of the Per&s;on whom He
had removed from his Coun&s;els, and with whom He &s;hould not hereafter
advi&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>WHEN the Hou&s;e of Commons came together,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ Me|thods u&s;ed to induce $word$ Hou&s;es to thank the King for removing him.</NOTE> one <HI>Tomkins,</HI> a Man of
very contemptible Parts and of wor&s;e Manners (who u&s;ed to be encouraged
by Men of De&s;ign to &s;et &s;ome Motion on Foot, which They thought not fit
to appear in them&s;elves till They di&s;cerned how it would take), moved the
<MILESTONE N="10">Hou&s;e, &startq;that They might &s;end a Me&s;&s;age of Thanks to the King for his
gracious Expre&s;&s;ions, and for the many good Things which He had done,
and particularly for his removing the Chancellor;&endq; which was &s;econded
by two or three, but rejected by the Hou&s;e as a Thing unrea&s;onable for
them who knew not the Motives which had di&s;po&s;ed his Maje&s;ty: And &s;o
a Committee was appointed to prepare &s;uch a Me&s;&s;age as might be fit for
them to &s;end. And the Hou&s;e of Lords the &s;ame Day &s;ent to the King,
without con&s;ulting with the Hou&s;e of Commons, to give his Maje&s;ty Thanks
for the Speech He had made to them in the Morning, which commonly
u&s;ed to be done. The King declared him&s;elf very much offended that the
<MILESTONE N="20">Propo&s;ition in the Hou&s;e of Commons for returning Thanks to him had not
&s;ucceeded, and more that it had been oppo&s;ed by many of his own Servants;
and commanded them &startq;to pre&s;s and renew the Motion: That his Honour
was concerned in it; and therefore He would expect Thanks, and would
take it very ill of any of his own Servants who refu&s;ed to concur in it.&endq;
Hereupon it was again moved: But notwith&s;tanding all the Labour that had
been u&s;ed contrary to all Cu&s;tom and Privilege of Parliament, the Que&s;tion
held &s;ix Hours Debate, very many &s;peaking again&s;t the Inju&s;tice and Irregu|larity
of it; They on the other Side urging the King's Expectation of it.
In the End the Que&s;tion being put, it was believed the <HI>Noes</HI> were the greater
<MILESTONE N="30">Number: But the Divi&s;ion of the Hou&s;e was not urged for many Rea&s;ons;
and &s;o the Vote was &s;ent to the Hou&s;e of Lords, who were de&s;ired to con|cur
with them.</P>
<P>BUT it had there a greater Contradiction. They had already returned
their Thanks to the King; and now to &s;end again, and to add any Parti|cular
to it, would be very incongruous and without any Precedent: And
therefore They would not concur in it. This Ob&s;tinacy very much di&s;|plea&s;ed
the King: And He was per&s;uaded by tho&s;e who had hitherto pre|vailed
with him, to believe that this Contradiction, if He did not ma&s;ter it,
would run through all his Bu&s;ine&s;s that &s;hould be brought into that Hou&s;e.
<MILESTONE N="40">Whereupon his Maje&s;ty reproached many of the Lords for pre&s;uming to op|po&s;e
and cro&s;s what was &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for his Service: And &s;ent to
the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> &startq;that He &s;hould in his Maje&s;ty's Name
command all the Bi&s;hops Bench to concur in it; and if They &s;hould refu&s;e
it, He would make them repent it;&endq; with many other very &s;evere Repre|hen&s;ions
and Animadver&s;ions. This being done in &s;o extraordinary a Man|ner,
the Duke of <HI>York</HI> told his Maje&s;ty, &startq;how much it was &s;poken of and
wondered at:&endq; To which his Maje&s;ty replied, &startq;that his Honour was en|gaged,
and that He would not be &s;atisfied if Thanks were not returned to
him by Both Hou&s;es; and that it &s;hould go the wor&s;e for the Chancellor
<MILESTONE N="50">if his Friends oppo&s;ed it.&endq; And He commanded his Royal Highne&s;s that
He &s;hould not cro&s;s it, but was contented to di&s;pen&s;e with his Attendance,
and gave him Leave to be ab&s;ent from the Debate; which Liberty many
<PB N="444" REF="450">
others likewi&s;e took: And &s;o when it was again moved, though it &s;till was
confidently oppo&s;ed, it was carried by a major Part, many being ab&s;ent.</P>
<P>AND &s;o Both Hou&s;es attended the King and gave him Thanks, which
his Maje&s;ty graciou&s;ly received as a Boon He looked for, and &s;aid Somewhat
that implied that He was much di&s;plea&s;ed with the Chancellor; of which
&s;ome Men thought They were to make the be&s;t U&s;e They could. And
therefore, after the King's An&s;wer was reported to the Hou&s;e of Peers,
as of Cour&s;e what&s;oever the King &s;ays upon any Me&s;&s;age is always reported,
it was propo&s;ed, &startq;that the King's An&s;wer might be entered into the Jour|nal-Book;&endq;
which was rejected, as not u&s;ual, even when the King him|&s;elf<MILESTONE N="10">
&s;poke to Both Hou&s;es: Nor was what He now &s;aid entered in the Hou&s;e
of Commons. However when They had con&s;ulted together, finding that
They had not yet &s;o particular a Record of the Di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t the Chan|cellor,
as what He had &s;aid upon this Me&s;&s;age did amount unto, They
moved the Hou&s;e again, &startq;that it might be entered in the Book:&endq; And it
was again rejected. All which would not &s;erve the Turn; but the Duke of
<HI>Buckingham</HI> a third Time moved it, as a Thing the King expected: And
thereupon it was entered.</P>
<P>AND his Maje&s;ty now declared to his Brother and to many of the Lords,
that He had now all He de&s;ired, and that there &s;hould be no more done<MILESTONE N="20">
to the Chancellor.&endq; And without Doubt the King had not at this Time
a Purpo&s;e to give any farther Countenance to the Animo&s;ity of his Enemies,
who thought that what was already done was too ea&s;y a Compo&s;ition, and
told his Maje&s;ty, &startq;that, if He were not pro&s;ecuted farther, He would gain
Reputation by it: For that the Manner in which all Votes had been yet
carried was rather a Vindication than Cen&s;ure of him; and He would
&s;hortly come to the Hou&s;e with more Credit to do Mi&s;chief, and to ob|&s;truct
what&s;oever related to his Service. But that &s;uch Things would
be found again&s;t him, as &s;oon as Men were &s;atisfied that his Maje&s;ty had
totally de&s;erted him (which yet They were not), that He would have no<MILESTONE N="30">
more Credit to do Good or Harm.&endq; Hereupon there were &s;everal Cabals
entered into,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Per&s;ons &s;ought after to fur|ni&s;h Matter of Impeachment again&s;t him.</NOTE> who invited and &s;ent for Per&s;ons of all Conditions, who had
had any Bu&s;ine&s;s depending before the Chancellor, or Charters pa&s;&s;ed the

or They were otherwi&s;e grieved by him, promi&s;ing that They &s;hould receive
ample Reparation.</P>

the Office He had conferred on him, and &s;ent him by the next Shipping into

that Government for him, and in di&s;countenancing and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e
who in <HI>England</HI> or in the I&s;lands had complained of him), &startq;and what<MILESTONE N="50">

but that He was not able to do it: Nor did He believe that He
had ever received any Money from the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> or from the

<MILESTONE N="30">Some others &s;econded him with very bitter Invectives: And as

<P>THESE Reports,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Declaration of the Chancel|lor's Innocence.</NOTE> being &s;pread abroad, wrought upon the Duke to de&s;ire

<P>THE Duke then told it to his Secretary Mr. <HI>Wren,</HI> and to many other
Per&s;ons, and wi&s;hed them to publi&s;h it upon any Occa&s;ion: Upon which it
was &s;pread abroad, and Mr. <HI>Wren</HI> informed many of the Members of the

adjourned without doing any Thing. Hereupon Sir <HI>Thomas O&s;borne,</HI> a De|pendant
and Creature of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and who had told many<MILESTONE N="40">
Per&s;ons in the Country before the Parliament met, &startq;that the Chancellor
would be accu&s;ed of High Trea&s;on; and if He were not hanged, He
would be hanged him&s;elf;&endq; this Gentleman went to the King, and in|formed
him what Mr. <HI>Wren</HI> confidently reported in all Places, &startq;which very
much di&s;&s;atisfied that Party that de&s;ired to do him Service; &s;o that They
knew not how to behave them&s;elves:&endq; To which his Maje&s;ty an&s;wered,

<P>ALL this begat new Pau&s;es, and no Advance was made in many
Days; &s;o that it was generally believed that there would be no farther Pro|&s;ecution:
But the old Argument, that They were gone too far to retire, had
now more Force, becau&s;e many Members of Both Hou&s;es were now joined
to the Party in declaring again&s;t the Chancellor, who would think them|&s;elves
to be betrayed and de&s;erted if no more &s;hould be done again&s;t him.
And hereupon the Committee was again revived, that was appointed to pre|pare
<MILESTONE N="10">Heads for a Charge, which &s;ate many Days, there being little Debate
upon the Matter; for &s;uch of the Committee, who knew him well, were
&s;o well plea&s;ed to find him accu&s;ed of Nothing but what all the World did
believe him not guilty of, that They thought They could not do him more
Right, than to &s;uffer all that was offered to pa&s;s, &s;ince there appeared no
Per&s;on that offered to make Proof of any Particular that was &s;ugge&s;ted. But
three or four Members of the Hou&s;e brought &s;everal Papers, containing Par|ticulars
&startq;which,&endq; They &s;aid, &startq;would be proved:&endq; All which They reported
to the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>THE Heads were;</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20">I. &startq;THAT the Chancellor had traiterou&s;ly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Articles of the Charge again&s;t him.</NOTE> about the Month of <HI>June</HI> la&s;t,
advi&s;ed the King to di&s;&s;olve the Parliament, and &s;aid <HI>there could be no far|ther
U&s;e of Parliaments; that it was a fooli&s;h Con&s;titution and not fit to
govern by; and that it could not be imagined, that three or four hundred
Country Gentlemen could be either prudent Men or State&s;men:</HI> And <HI>that it
would be be&s;t for the King to rai&s;e a &s;tanding Army and to govern by that;</HI>
whereupon it being demanded how that Army &s;hould be maintained, He
an&s;wered, <HI>by Contribution and free Quarter, as the la&s;t King maintained
his Army in the War.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>II. &startq;THAT He had, in the Hearing of &s;everal Per&s;ons, reported <HI>that the
<MILESTONE N="30">King was a Papi&s;t in his Heart, or popi&s;hly affected,</HI> or had u&s;ed Words
to that Effect.&endq;</P>
<P>III. &startq;THAT He had advi&s;ed the King to grant a Charter to the <HI>Canary</HI>
Company, for which He had received great Sums of Money.&endq;</P>
<P>IV. &startq;THAT He had rai&s;ed great Sums of Money by the Sale of Offices
which ought not to be &s;old, and granted Injunctions to &s;top Proceedings
at Law, and di&s;&s;olved them afterwards for Money.&endq;</P>
<P>V. &startq;THAT He had introduced an arbitrary Government into his Ma|je&s;ty's
&s;everal Plantations, and had cau&s;ed &s;uch as had complained to his
Maje&s;ty and Privy Council of it to be impri&s;oned long for their Pre&s;ump|tion;
<MILESTONE N="40">and that He had fru&s;trated and rejected a Propo&s;ition that had
been made for the Pre&s;ervation of <HI>Nevis</HI> and <HI>St. Chri&s;tophers,</HI> and for
the reducing the <HI>French</HI> Plantations to his Maje&s;ty's Obedience.&endq;</P>
<P>VI. &startq;THAT He had cau&s;ed <HI>Quo Warrantos</HI> to be i&s;&s;ued out again&s;t mo&s;t
Corporations in <HI>England,</HI> although the Charters were newly confirmed by
Act of Parliament, till They paid him good Sums of Money, and then
the <HI>Quo Warrantos</HI> were di&s;charged.&endq;</P>
<P>VII. &startq;THAT He had received great Sums of Money for the Settlement
of <HI>Ireland.&endq;</HI></P>
<P>VIII. &startq;THAT He had deluded the King and betrayed the Nation in all
<MILESTONE N="50">foreign Treaties and Negotiations, e&s;pecially concerning the late War.&endq;</P>
<P>IX. &startq;THAT He had procured his Maje&s;ty's Cu&s;toms to be farmed at
Underrates, knowing them to be &s;o; and cau&s;ed many pretended Debts
<PB N="448" REF="454">
to be paid by his Maje&s;ty, to the Payment whereof his Maje&s;ty was not
in Strictne&s;s bound; for all which He had received great Sums of Money.&endq;</P>
<P>X. &startq;THAT He had received Bribes from the Company of Vintners, that
They might continue the Prices of their Wines, and might be freed from
the Penalties which They were liable to.&endq;</P>
<P>XI. &startq;THAT He had rai&s;ed in a &s;hort Time a greater E&s;tate than could
be lawfully got; and that He had gotten the Grant of &s;everal of the
Crown Lands contrary to his Duty.&endq;</P>
<P>XII. &startq;THAT He had advi&s;ed and effected the Sale of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to the
<HI>French</HI> King, for le&s;s Money than the Ammunition, Artillery and Stores<MILESTONE N="10">
were worth.&endq;</P>
<P>XIII. &startq;THAT He had cau&s;ed the King's Letters under the Great Seal to
one Dr. <HI>Crowther</HI> to be altered, and the Enrolment thereof to be ra&s;ed.&endq;</P>
<P>XIV. &startq;THAT He had in an arbitrary Way examined and drawn into
Que&s;tion divers of his Maje&s;ty's Subjects concerning their Lands and Pro|perties,
and determined thereof at the Council-Table, and &s;topped the
Proceedings at Law, and threatened &s;ome that pleaded the Statute of
17 <HI>Car.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>XV. &startq;THAT He was a principal Author of that fatal Coun&s;el of dividing
the Fleet in <HI>June</HI> 1666.&endq;<MILESTONE N="20"></P>
<P>THE Committee reported another Article for his Charge, which was, &startq;that
He had kept Corre&s;pondence with <HI>Cromwell</HI> during the Time of the King's
being beyond the Seas, and had &s;ent over his Secretary to him, who was &s;hut
up with him for many Hours:&endq; But there were many Members of the
Hou&s;e, who wi&s;hed it had been true, knew well enough that fooli&s;h Ca|lumny
had been examined at <HI>Paris</HI> during the Time that his Maje&s;ty re|&s;ided
there, when Per&s;ons of the highe&s;t Degree were very de&s;irous to have
kindled a Jealou&s;y in the King of the Chancellor's Fidelity; and that the
Scandal appeared &s;o gro&s;s and impo&s;&s;ible, that his Maje&s;ty had then publi&s;hed
a full Vindication of his Innocence; with a farther Declaration, &startq;that when<MILESTONE N="30">
it &s;hould plea&s;e God to re&s;tore him to his own Dominions, He &s;hould re|ceive
&s;uch farther Ju&s;tice and Reparation, as the Laws would enable him
to procure.&endq; And it was well known to divers of the Members pre&s;ent,
that the Per&s;ons who were &s;uborned in that Con&s;piracy had acknowledged
it &s;ince the King's Return; and the Per&s;ons them&s;elves who had &s;uborned
them had confe&s;&s;ed it, and begged the Chancellor's Pardon: Of all which
his Maje&s;ty had been particularly and fully informed. And that it might
be no more ripped up or looked into, They &s;eemed to reject it as being in|cluded
under the <HI>Act of Indemnity,</HI> which They would have left him to
have pleaded for the Infamy of it, if They had not very well known the<MILESTONE N="40">
Gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of the Scandal.</P>
<P>THOUGH the Fiercene&s;s of the Malice that was contracted again&s;t him
was enough known and taken Notice of, yet the Heads for the Charge,
which upon &s;o much Deliberation were prepared and offered to the Hou&s;e
again&s;t him, were of &s;uch a Nature, that all Men pre&s;ent did in their own
Con&s;cience acquit him: And therefore it was generally believed the Pro&s;e|cutors
would rather have acquie&s;ced with what They had done to bla&s;t his
Reputation, than have proceeded farther to bring him to an&s;wer for him&s;elf.
But They had gone too far to retire. And They who had fir&s;t wrought
upon the King, only by per&s;uading him, &startq;that there was &s;o univer&s;al a<MILESTONE N="50">
Hatred again&s;t the Chancellor, that the Parliament would the fir&s;t Day
accu&s;e him of High Trea&s;on; and that the removing him from his
Office was the only Way to pre&s;erve him, except He would in &s;uch a
<PB N="449" REF="455">
Conjuncture, and when He had &s;o much Need of the Parliament, &s;acri|fice
all his Intere&s;t for the Protection of the Chancellor&endq; (and this was
the &s;ole Motive that had prevailed with him, as his Maje&s;ty not only a&s;|&s;ured
him the la&s;t Time He &s;pake with him, with many gracious Expre&s;|&s;ions,
but at large expre&s;&s;ed it to very many Per&s;ons of Honour, who
endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade him from pur&s;uing that Coun&s;el, &startq;that it was
the only Expedient for the Chancellor's Pre&s;ervation,&endq; with as great a
Te&s;timony of his Integrity and the Services He had done him as could be
given): The &s;ame Men now importuned him &startq;to pro&s;ecute with all his
<MILESTONE N="10">Power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King per|&s;uaded to en|courage the Pro&s;ecution.</NOTE> and to let tho&s;e of his Servants, and others who regarded his
Commands, know that They could not &s;erve him and the Chancellor
together; and that He &s;hould look upon their adhering to him as the
abandoning his Maje&s;ty's Service. That the Chancellor had &s;o great a
Faction in Both Hou&s;es, that no Propo&s;ition on his Maje&s;ty's Behalf would
have Effect; and that He would &s;hortly come to the Hou&s;e of Peers, and
ob&s;truct all Proceedings there.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS prevailed &s;o far that They re&s;umed their former Courage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings again&s;t him in the Hou&s;e of Commons.</NOTE> and pre&s;&s;ed
&startq;that He might be accu&s;ed by the Hou&s;e of Commons of High Trea&s;on:
Upon which the Lords would pre&s;ently commit him to the <HI>Tower;</HI> and then
<MILESTONE N="20">Nobody would have any longer Apprehen&s;ion of his Power to do Hurt.&endq;
Hereupon They re&s;olved again to con&s;ider the &s;everal Heads of the Charge
They had provided, to &s;ee if They could find any one upon which They could
ground an Accu&s;ation of High Trea&s;on. They &s;pent a whole Day upon the
fir&s;t Head, which They thought contained enough to do their Work, it con|taining
the mo&s;t unpopular and ungracious Reproach that any Man could
lie under; &startq;that He had de&s;igned a &s;tanding Army to be rai&s;ed, and to go|vern
the Kingdom thereby; He advi&s;ed the King to di&s;&s;olve the pre&s;ent
Parliament, to lay a&s;ide all Thoughts of Parliaments for the future, to go|vern
by military Power, and to maintain the &s;ame by free Quarter and
<MILESTONE N="30">Contribution.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Chancellor had been bred of the Gown; and in the fir&s;t War, in
which the la&s;t King had been involved by a powerful Rebellion, was known
always to have advanced and embraced all Overtures towards Peace. Since
the King's Return He laboured Nothing more, than that his Maje&s;ty might
enter into a firm Peace with all his Neighbours, as mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for the
reducing his own Dominions into that Temper of Subjection and Obedience,
as they ought to be in. It was notorious to all Men, that He had mo&s;t
pa&s;&s;ionately di&s;&s;uaded the War with <HI>Holland,</HI> with much Di&s;advantage to
him&s;elf; and that no Man had taken &s;o much Pains as He to bring the pre|&s;ent
<MILESTONE N="40">Peace to pa&s;s, which at that Time was grateful to all Degrees of Men:
And, in a Word, that He had no Manner of Intere&s;t or Credit with the
Soldiers; but was looked upon by them all, as an Enemy to the Privileges
which They required, of being exempted from the ordinary Rules of Ju&s;|tice,
in which He always oppo&s;ed them.</P>
<P>BUT let the Improbability of this Charge be what it would, there were
Per&s;ons of the Hou&s;e who pretended that it &s;hould be fully proved; and &s;o
the Que&s;tion was only, &startq;whether upon it They &s;hould charge him with
an Accu&s;ation of Trea&s;on:&endq; And after a Debate of eight Hours, it was
declared by all the Lawyers of the Hou&s;e, &startq;that how foul &s;oever the Charge
<MILESTONE N="50">&s;eemed to be, yet it contained no High Trea&s;on;&endq; and in that Conclu|&s;ion
They at la&s;t concurred who were mo&s;t relied upon to &s;upport the Ac|cu&s;ation.
But when the Speaker directed the Order to be drawn, &startq;that
the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> &s;hould not be accu&s;ed of High Trea&s;on,&endq; it was al|leged
<PB N="450" REF="456">
that the Order was only to relate to that fir&s;t Head; &s;ome Men de|claring,
&startq;that though that Article had mi&s;&s;ed him, yet there were others
which would hit him:&endq; And &s;o the Night being come, the farther De|bate
was adjourned to another Day.</P>
<P>WHEN the Day appointed came (in which Interval all imaginable Pains
and Arts were u&s;ed, by Threats and Promi&s;es, to allure and terrify as many
as could be wrought upon, either to be again&s;t the Chancellor, or to be ab|&s;ent
at the next Debate that concerned him), upon reading the &s;everal other
Heads as they had been pre&s;ented from the Committee, it appeared to all
Men, that though all that was alleged were proved, the Whole would not<MILESTONE N="10">
amount to make him guilty of High Trea&s;on. And They got no Ground
by throwing A&s;per&s;ions upon him upon the &s;everal Arguments, which They
did with extraordinary Licen&s;e who were known to be his Enemies; for
thereby other Men of much better Reputations, and who had no Relation
to the Chancellor, took Occa&s;ion to an&s;wer and contradict their Calumnies,
and to give him &s;uch a Te&s;timony, as made him another Man than They
would have him under&s;tood to be; and their Te&s;timony had more Credit:
So that They declined the Pur&s;uit of that Licen&s;e, and intended wholly the
Di&s;covery of the Trea&s;on, &s;ince no other Accu&s;ation would &s;erve their
Turn.<MILESTONE N="20"></P>
<P>WHEN They had examined all their Store, They pitched at la&s;t upon
that Head, &startq;that He had deluded and betrayed his Maje&s;ty and the Nation
in all foreign Treaties and Negotiations relating to the late War:&endq; Which
when read and con&s;idered, it was &s;aid, &startq;that in tho&s;e general Expre&s;&s;ions
there was not enough contained upon which They could accu&s;e him of
High Trea&s;on, except it were added, that being a Privy Coun&s;ellor He
had di&s;covered the King's &s;ecret Coun&s;els to the Enemy.&endq; Which was no
&s;ooner &s;aid, than a young confident Man, the Lord <HI>Vaughan,</HI> Son to the
Earl of <HI>Carbery,</HI> a Per&s;on of as ill a Face as Fame, his Looks and his Man|ners
Both extreme bad, a&s;ked for the Paper that had been pre&s;ented from<MILESTONE N="30">
the Committee, and with his own Hand entered into that Place tho&s;e Words,
&startq;that being a Privy Coun&s;ellor He had di&s;covered the King's Secrets to the
Enemy,&endq; which He &s;aid He would prove; whil&s;t many others whi&s;pered
into the Ears of tho&s;e who &s;ate next to them, &startq;that He had di&s;covered all
the &s;ecret Re&s;olutions to the King of <HI>France,</HI> which,&endq; They &s;aid, &startq;was
the Ground of the King's Di&s;plea&s;ure towards him.&endq; Upon this confident
In&s;inuation from Per&s;ons who were near the Per&s;on of his Maje&s;ty, and
known to have much Credit with him; and the po&s;itive Averment by a
Member, &startq;that the di&s;clo&s;ing the King's Secrets to the Enemy,&endq; which No|body
could deny to be Trea&s;on, &startq;would be po&s;itively and fully proved<MILESTONE N="40">
again&s;t him,&endq; and the rather becau&s;e no Man believed it to be true; it was
voted, &startq;that They &s;hould impeach him of High Trea&s;on in the u&s;ual
Manner to the Hou&s;e of Peers.&endq; Whereupon Mr. <HI>Seymour,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Seymour <HI>accu&s;es him of High Trea&s;on at the Bar of the Hou&s;e of Lords.</HI></NOTE> who had ap|peared
very violent again&s;t him, was &s;ent up to the Lords; and at the Bar
He accu&s;ed <HI>Edward</HI> Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> of High Trea&s;on and other Crimes
and Mi&s;demeanors, and de&s;ired &startq;that He might be &s;eque&s;tered from that
Hou&s;e, and his Per&s;on &s;ecured.&endq;</P>
<P>AND as &s;oon as He was withdrawn, &s;ome of the Lords moved, &startq;that
He might be &s;ent for:&endq;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates in that Hou&s;e concern|ing his Com|mitment.</NOTE> And now the Warmth that had been &s;o long
within the Walls of the Hou&s;e of Commons appeared in the Hou&s;e of Peers.<MILESTONE N="50">
Many of the Lords, who were not thought much inclined to the Per|&s;on
of the Chancellor, repre&s;ented, &startq;that the Con&s;equence of &s;uch a Pro|ceeding
would reflect to the Prejudice of every one of the Peers. If
<PB N="451" REF="457">
upon a general Accu&s;ation from the Hou&s;e of Commons of High Trea&s;on,
without mentioning any Particular, They &s;hould be obliged to commit
any Peer; any Member that Hou&s;e &s;hould be offended with, how unju&s;tly
&s;oever, might be removed from the Body: Which would be a greater
Di&s;advantage than the Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons were liable to.&endq;
And therefore They advi&s;ed, &startq;that They &s;hould for An&s;wer let the Hou&s;e
of Commons know, that They would not commit the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI>
until &s;ome particular Charge was exhibited again&s;t him.&endq;</P>
<P>ON the other Side, it was urged with much Pa&s;&s;ion, &startq;that They ought
<MILESTONE N="10">to comply with the Hou&s;e of Commons in &s;atisfying their Reque&s;ts, ac|cording
to former Precedents:&endq; And the Ca&s;e of the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI>
and &s;ome other Ca&s;es in that Parliament, were cited; which gave tho&s;e who
were of another Mind Opportunity to inveigh again&s;t that Time, and the
accur&s;ed Precedents thereof, which had produced &s;o many and great Mi&s;|chiefs
to the Kingdom. They put them in Mind, &startq;that They had com|mitted
eleven Bi&s;hops at one Time for High Trea&s;on, only that They might
be removed from the Hou&s;e, whil&s;t a Bill pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t their having Votes
any more in that Hou&s;e, which was no &s;ooner pa&s;&s;ed than They were &s;et at
Liberty; which had brought great Scandal and great Reproach upon the
<MILESTONE N="20">Honour and Ju&s;tice of the Parliament: And that Both tho&s;e Bills, for the
Attainder of the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> and for the excluding the Bi&s;hops out
of the Hou&s;e of Peers, &s;tand at pre&s;ent repealed by the Wi&s;dom and Au|thority
of this Parliament.&endq; In a Word, after many Hours Debate with
much Pa&s;&s;ion, either Side adhering ob&s;tinately to their Opinion, no Re&s;olu|tion
was taken; but the Hou&s;e adjourned, without &s;o much as putting the
Que&s;tion, to the next Day.</P>
<P>FROM the Time of the Parliament's coming together, and after the King's
Di&s;plea&s;ure was generally taken Notice of, many of the Chancellor's Friends
advi&s;ed him to withdraw, and tran&s;port him&s;elf into foreign Parts; and &s;ome
<MILESTONE N="30">very near the King, and who were Witne&s;&s;es of the very great Di&s;plea&s;ure
his Maje&s;ty every Day expre&s;&s;ed towards him, were of the &s;ame Opinion:
But He po&s;itively refu&s;ed &s;o to do, and re&s;olved to tru&s;t to his Innocence,
which He was &s;ure mu&s;t appear.</P>
<P>THE Debate continued &s;till between the two Hou&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Differences between the Hou&s;es.</NOTE> which would en|tertain
no other Bu&s;ine&s;s: The Hou&s;e of Commons in frequent Conferences
demanding the Commitment of the Chancellor; and the major Part of the
Hou&s;e of Peers, notwith&s;tanding all the indirect Pro&s;ecution and Interpo|&s;ition
from the Court, remaining as re&s;olved not to commit him. In this
unhappy Conjuncture, the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> who expre&s;&s;ed great Affection and
<MILESTONE N="40">Concernment for the Chancellor, fell &s;ick of the Smallpox; which proved
of great Di&s;advantage to him. For not only many of the Peers who were
before re&s;trained by their Re&s;pect to him, and &s;upported by his Countenance
in the Debates, either changed their Minds, or ab&s;ented them&s;elves from the
Hou&s;e; but the General, who had always profe&s;&s;ed great Friend&s;hip to the
Chancellor, who had de&s;erved very well from him, and had endeavoured to
di&s;&s;uade the King from withdrawing his Favour from him with all po&s;&s;ible
Importunity, was now changed by the unruly Humour of his Wife, and
the frequent In&s;tances of the King; and made it his Bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;olicit and
di&s;po&s;e the Members of Both Hou&s;es, with many of whom He had great
<MILESTONE N="50">Credit, &startq;no longer to adhere to the Chancellor, &s;ince the King re&s;olved to
ruin him, and would look upon all who were his Friends as Enemies to
his Maje&s;ty.&endq; Notwith&s;tanding all which, the major Part by much of the
Hou&s;e of Peers continued &s;till firm again&s;t his Commitment: With which
<PB N="452" REF="458">
the King was &s;o offended, that there were &s;ecret Con&s;ultations of &s;ending a
Guard of Soldiers, by the General's Authority, to take the Chancellor out
of his Hou&s;e, and to &s;end him to the <HI>Tower;</HI> whither Directions were al|ready
&s;ent what Lodging He &s;hould have, and Caution given to the Lieu|tenant
of the <HI>Tower,</HI> who was thought to have too much Re&s;pect for the
Chancellor, &startq;that He &s;hould not treat him with more Civility than He did
other Pri&s;oners.&endq;</P>
<P>HE had many Friends of the Council and near the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancellor is again ad|vi&s;ed to with|draw.</NOTE> who adver|ti&s;ed
him of tho&s;e and all other Intrigues, and thereupon renewed their Im|portunity
that He would make his E&s;cape; and &s;ome of them undertook to<MILESTONE N="10">
know, and without Que&s;tion did believe, &startq;that his withdrawing would be
grateful to the King,&endq; who every Day grew more incen&s;ed again&s;t him,
for the Ob&s;tinacy his Friends in Both Hou&s;es expre&s;&s;ed on his Behalf. They
urged &startq;the ill Condition He mu&s;t in a &s;hort Time be reduced to, wherein
his Innocence would not &s;ecure him; for it was evident that his Enemies
had no Purpo&s;e or Thought of bringing him to a Trial, but to keep him
always in Pri&s;on, which They would in the End one Way or other bring
to pa&s;s: Whereas He might now ea&s;ily tran&s;port him&s;elf, and avoid all
the other Inconveniences.&endq; And They undertook to know, &startq;that if He
were gone, there would be no farther Proceeding again&s;t him.&endq;<MILESTONE N="20"></P>
<P>THERE could not be a more terrifying or prevalent Argument u&s;ed to|wards
his withdrawing, than that of a Pri&s;on; the Thought and Apprehen|&s;ion
whereof was more grievous to him than of Death it&s;elf, which He was
confident would quickly be the Effect of the other. However He very re|&s;olutely
refu&s;ed to follow their Advice;<NOTE PLACE="marg">But refu&s;es.</NOTE> and urged to them &startq;the Advantage
He &s;hould give his Enemies, and the Di&s;honour He &s;hould bring upon
him&s;elf, by flying, in having his Integrity condemned, if He had not the
Confidence to defend it.&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;He could now appear, wherever
He &s;hould be required, with an hone&s;t Countenance, and the Courage of
an innocent Man: But if He &s;hould be apprehended in a Di&s;gui&s;e running<MILESTONE N="30">
away, which He could not but expect by the Vigilance of his Enemies
(&s;ince He could not make any Journey by Land, being at that Time very
weak and infirm), He &s;hould be very much out of Countenance, and
&s;hould be expo&s;ed to publick Scorn and Contempt. And if He &s;hould
make his E&s;cape into foreign Parts, it would not be rea&s;onable to expect
or imagine that his Enemies, who had &s;o far aliened the King's Affec|tion
from him, and in Spite of his Innocence prevailed thus far, would
want Power to pro&s;ecute the Advantage They &s;hould get by his Flight,
which would be interpreted as a Confe&s;&s;ion of his Guilt; and thereupon
They would procure &s;uch Proceedings in the Parliament, as might ruin<MILESTONE N="40">
both his Fortune and his Fame.&endq;</P>
<P>HIS Friends, how un&s;atisfied &s;oever with his Re&s;olution, acquie&s;ced for
the pre&s;ent, after having fir&s;t prevailed with him to write him&s;elf to the
King; which He did, though without any Hope that it would make any
Impre&s;&s;ion upon him. He could not comprehend or imagine from what

your Maje&s;ty's declared Anger and Indignation deprives me of the Comfort

have &s;ometimes di&s;plea&s;ed, when (and only then) your Maje&s;ty believed
them not to be your Friends. I hope They may be changed; I am &s;ure
I am not, but have the &s;ame Duty, Pa&s;&s;ion and Affection for you, that I
<MILESTONE N="30">had when You thought it mo&s;t unque&s;tionable, and which was and is as

If it be for any Thing my Lord <HI>Berkley</HI> hath reported, which I know He
hath &s;aid to many, though being charged with it by me He did as po&s;itively
di&s;claim it; I am as innocent in that whole Affair, and gave no more Advice

<MILESTONE N="40">your Maje&s;ty &s;eemed once to believe, when I took Notice to you of the

Me&s;&s;age from either in my Life. And this I prote&s;t to your Maje&s;ty is

<P>THE King was in his Cabinet when the Letter was delivered to him;
which as &s;oon as He had read, He burned in a Candle that was on the Ta|ble,<MILESTONE N="20">

Advice that He would be gone.</P>
<P>THE King's Di&s;cour&s;e was according to the Per&s;ons with whom He con|ferred.
To tho&s;e who were engaged in the violent Pro&s;ecution He &s;pake with
great Bitterne&s;s of him, repeating many particular Pa&s;&s;ages, in which He had
&s;hewed much Pa&s;&s;ion becau&s;e his Maje&s;ty did not concur with him in what
He advi&s;ed. To tho&s;e who He knew were his Friends He mentioned him
without any Bitterne&s;s, and with &s;ome Te&s;timony of his having &s;erved him<MILESTONE N="30">
long and u&s;efully, and as if He had Pity and Compa&s;&s;ion for him: Yet
&startq;that He wondered that He did not ab&s;ent him&s;elf, &s;ince it could not but
be very manife&s;t to him and to all his Friends, that it was not in his
Maje&s;ty's Power to protect him again&s;t the Prejudice that was again&s;t him
in Both Hou&s;es; which,&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;could not but be increa&s;ed by the

under&s;tood, and could have been well content that the Lords would have
con&s;ented to his Impri&s;onment.</P>
<P>THE Bi&s;hop of <HI>Hereford,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Bi&s;hop of</HI> Hereford <HI>&s;ent to advi&s;e him to leave the Kingdom.</HI></NOTE> who had been very much obliged to the Chan|cellor,
and throughout this whole Affair had behaved him&s;elf with very &s;ig|nal
Ingratitude to him, and thereby got much Credit in the Court, went
to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> who was known to be a fa&s;t and un&s;haken
Friend to the Chancellor; and made him a long Di&s;cour&s;e of what the King
had &s;aid to him, and de&s;ired him &startq;that He would go with him to his Hou&s;e;&endq;
which He pre&s;ently did, and, leaving him in a Room, went him&s;elf to the
Chancellor, and told him what had pa&s;&s;ed from the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Hereford,</HI><MILESTONE N="50">
&startq;who was in the next Room to &s;peak with him, but would not in direct
Words to him acknowledge that He &s;pake by the King's Order or Appro|bation;
but that He had confe&s;&s;ed &s;o much to him with many Circum|&s;tances,
<PB N="455" REF="461">
and that the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> and Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> had been pre&s;ent.&endq;
The Chancellor had no Mind to &s;ee or &s;peak with the Bi&s;hop, who
had carried him&s;elf &s;o unworthily towards him, and might probably mi&s;re|port
any Thing He &s;hould &s;ay: But He was overruled by the other Bi&s;hop;
and &s;o They went Both into the next Room to him.</P>
<P>THE Bi&s;hop of <HI>Hereford</HI> in &s;ome Di&s;order, as a Man con&s;cious to him&s;elf
of &s;ome Want of Sincerity towards him, de&s;ired &startq;that He would believe that
He would not at that Time have come to him, with whom He knew He was
in &s;ome Umbrage, if it were not with a De&s;ire to do him Service, and if He
<MILESTONE N="10">had not a full Authority for what&s;oever He &s;aid to him.&endq; Then He enlarged
him&s;elf in Di&s;cour&s;e more involved and perplexed, without any Mention of the
King, or the Authority He had for what He &s;hould &s;ay; the Care to avoid
which was evidently the Cau&s;e of the Want of Clearne&s;s in all He &s;aid.
But the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> &s;upplied it by relating all that He had &s;aid
to him: With which though He was not plea&s;ed, becau&s;e the King and
others were named, yet He did not contradict it; but &s;aid, &startq;He did not
&s;ay that He was &s;ent by the King or &s;pake by his Direction, only <HI>that He
could not be &s;o mad as to interpo&s;e in &s;uch an Affair without full Authority
to make good all that He &s;hould promi&s;e.</HI>&endq; The Sum of all was, &startq;that
<MILESTONE N="20">if the Chancellor would withdraw him&s;elf into any Parts beyond the Seas,
to prevent the Mi&s;chiefs that mu&s;t befall the Kingdom by the Divi&s;ion and
Difference between the two Hou&s;es; He would undertake upon his Sal|vation,&endq;
which was the Expre&s;&s;ion He u&s;ed more than once, &startq;that He
&s;hould not be interrupted in his Journey; and that after He &s;hould be
gone, He &s;hould not be in any Degree pro&s;ecuted, or &s;uffer in his Ho|nour
or Fortune by his Ab&s;ence.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Chancellor told him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which He re|fu&s;es to do without re|ceiving a Com|mand from his Maje&s;ty.</NOTE> &startq;that He well under&s;tood what He mu&s;t
&s;uffer by withdrawing him&s;elf, and &s;o declining the Trial, in which his
Innocence would &s;ecure him, and in the mean Time pre&s;erve him from
<MILESTONE N="30">being terrified with the Threats and Malice of his Enemies: However He
would expo&s;e him&s;elf to that Di&s;advantage, if He received his Maje&s;ty's
Commands to that Purpo&s;e, or if He had but a clear Evidence that his
Maje&s;ty did wi&s;h it, as a Thing that He thought might advance his Ser|vice.
But without that A&s;&s;urance, which He might receive many Ways
which could not be taken Notice of, He could not with his Honour
or Di&s;cretion give his implacable Enemies that Advantage again&s;t him,
when his Friends &s;hould be able to allege Nothing in his Defence.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Bi&s;hop replied, &startq;that He was not allowed to &s;ay that his Maje&s;ty
required or wi&s;hed it, but that He could not be &s;o mad as to undertake
<MILESTONE N="40">what He had promi&s;ed, without &s;ufficient Warrant;&endq; and repeated again
what He had formerly &s;aid. To which the other an&s;wered, &startq;that the Vi|gilance
and Power of his Enemies was well known: And that though the
King might in Truth wi&s;h that He were &s;afe on the other Side of the Sea,
and give no Direction to interrupt or trouble him in his Journey; yet that
it was liable to many Accidents in Re&s;pect of his Weakne&s;s and Infirmity,&endq;
which was &s;o great at that Time, that He could not walk without being
&s;upported by one or two; &s;o that He could not be di&s;gui&s;ed to any Body
that had ever known him. Be&s;ides that the Pain He was already in,
and the Sea&s;on of the Year, made him apprehend, that the Gout might &s;o
<MILESTONE N="50">&s;eize upon him within two or three Days, that He might not be able to
move: And &s;o the Malice of tho&s;e who wi&s;hed his De&s;truction might very
probably find an Opportunity, without or again&s;t the King's Con&s;ent, to
apprehend and ca&s;t him into Pri&s;on, as a Fugitive from the Hand of Ju&s;tice.
<PB N="456" REF="462">
For the Prevention of all which, which no Man could blame him for appre|hending,
He propo&s;ed, &startq;that He might have a Pa&s;s from the King, which
He would not produce but in &s;uch an Exigent: And would u&s;e all the
Providence He could, to proceed with that Secrecy that his Departure
&s;hould not be taken Notice of; but if it were, He mu&s;t not be without
&s;uch a Protection, to pre&s;erve him from the pre&s;ent Indignities to which
He mu&s;t be liable, though po&s;&s;ibly it would not protect him from the
Di&s;plea&s;ure of the Parliament.&endq; The Bi&s;hop thought this Propo&s;ition to
be rea&s;onable, and &s;eemed confident that He &s;hould procure the Pa&s;s: And
&s;o that Conference ended.<MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>THE next Day the Bi&s;hop &s;ent Word, &startq;that the King could not grant
the Pa&s;s, becau&s;e if it &s;hould be known, by what Accident &s;oever, it
would much incen&s;e the Parliament: But that He might as &s;ecurely go
as if He had a Pa&s;s;&endq; which moved no farther with him, than his former
Undertaking had done. Nor could the Importunity of his Children, or the
Advice of his Friends, per&s;uade him to depart from his Re&s;olution.</P>
<P>ABOUT the Time of the Chancellor's Di&s;grace,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> French <HI>Amba&s;&s;adour urges him to retire to</HI> France.</NOTE> <HI>Monfieur Ruvigny</HI> arrived
at <HI>London</HI> as Envoy Extraordinary from the <HI>French</HI> King, and came the
next Day after the Seal was taken from him. He was a Per&s;on well known
in the Court, and particularly to the Chancellor, with whom He had been<MILESTONE N="20">
formerly a&s;&s;igned to treat upon Affairs of Moment, being of the Religion
and very nearly allied to the late Earl of <HI>Southampton.</HI> And as the&s;e Con&s;i|derations
were the chief Motives that He was made Choice of for the pre&s;ent
Employment, &s;o the chief Part of his In&s;tructions was to apply him&s;elf to
the Chancellor, through who&s;e Hands it was known that the whole Treaty
that was now happily concluded, and all the Preliminaries with <HI>France,</HI> had
entirely pa&s;&s;ed. When He found that the Conduct of Affairs was quite
changed, and that the Chancellor came not to the Court, He knew not what
to do, but immediately di&s;patched an Expre&s;s to <HI>France</HI> for farther In&s;truc|tions.
He de&s;ired to &s;peak with the Chancellor; which He refu&s;ed, and<MILESTONE N="30">
likewi&s;e to receive the Letters which He had brought for him and offered
to &s;end to him, all which He de&s;ired might be delivered to the King.
When the Proceedings in Parliament went &s;o high, <HI>Ruvigny,</HI> who had at
all Hours Admi&s;&s;ion to the King, and intimate Conver&s;ation with the Lord
<HI>Arlington,</HI> and &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;covered the extreme Prejudice and Malice that
was contracted again&s;t the Chancellor, &s;ent him frequent Adverti&s;ements of
what was nece&s;&s;ary for him to know, and with all po&s;&s;ible Earne&s;tne&s;s ad|vi&s;ed
him, when the Divi&s;ions grew &s;o high in the Hou&s;es, &startq;that He would
withdraw and retire into <HI>France,</HI> where&endq; He a&s;&s;ured him &startq;He would find
him&s;elf very welcome:&endq;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which He declines.</NOTE> All which prevailed no more with him than the<MILESTONE N="40">
re&s;t. And &s;o another Week pa&s;&s;ed after the Bi&s;hop's Propo&s;ition, with the
&s;ame Pa&s;&s;ion in the Hou&s;es: And Endeavours were u&s;ed to incen&s;e the Peo|ple,
as if the Lords ob&s;tructed the Proceeding of Ju&s;tice again&s;t the Chan|cellor
by refu&s;ing to commit him; and Mr. <HI>Seymour</HI> told the Lord <HI>A&s;hley,</HI>
&startq;that the People would pull down the Chancellor's Hou&s;e fir&s;t, and then
tho&s;e of all the Lords who adhered to him.&endq;</P>
<P>BY this Time the Duke of <HI>York</HI> recovered &s;o fa&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">At length the King $word$ to him to with|draw.</NOTE> that the King, being
a&s;&s;ured by the Phy&s;icians that there would be no Danger of Infection, went
on Saturday Morning, the twenty ninth of <HI>November,</HI> to vi&s;it him: And
being alone together, his Maje&s;ty bade him &startq;advi&s;e the Chancellor to be<MILESTONE N="50">
gone,&endq; and blamed him that He had not given Credit to what the Bi&s;hop
of <HI>Hereford</HI> had &s;aid to him. The King had no &s;ooner left the Duke, but his
Highne&s;s &s;ent for the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> and bade him tell the Chan|cellor
<PB N="457" REF="463">
from him, &startq;that it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for him &s;peedily to be
gone, and that He had the King's Word for all that had been undertaken
by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Hereford.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as the Chancellor received this Advice and Command,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He unwilling|ly obeys, and leaves the Kingdom.</NOTE> He re|&s;olved
with great Reluctancy to obey, and to be gone that very Night:
And having, by the Friend&s;hip of Sir <HI>John Wol&s;tenholme,</HI> cau&s;ed the Far|mers
Boat to wait for him at <HI>Erith,</HI> as &s;oon as it was dark He took Coach
at his Hou&s;e <HI>Saturday</HI> Night, the twenty ninth of <HI>November</HI> 1667, with
two Servants only. And being accompanied with his two Sons and two or
<MILESTONE N="10">three other Friends on Hor&s;eback as far as <HI>Erith,</HI> He found the Boat ready;
and &s;o embarked about Eleven of the Clock that Night, the Wind indif|ferently
good: But before Midnight it changed, and carried him back al|mo&s;t
as far as He had advanced. And in this Perplexity He remained three
Days and Nights before He arrived at <HI>Calais,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He lands at</HI> Calais.</NOTE> which was not a Port cho&s;en
by him, all Places out of <HI>England</HI> being indifferent, and <HI>France</HI> not being
in his Inclination, becau&s;e of the Reproach and Calumny that was ca&s;t upon
him: But &s;ince it was the fir&s;t that offered it&s;elf, and it was not &s;ea&s;onable
to affect another, He was very glad to di&s;embark there, and to find him&s;elf
&s;afe on Shore.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20">ALL the&s;e Particulars, of which many may &s;eem too trivial to be remem|bered,
have been thought nece&s;&s;ary to be related, it being a principal Part
of his Vindication for going away, and not in&s;i&s;ting upon his Innocence;
which at that Time made a greater Impre&s;&s;ion upon many worthy Per&s;ons
to his Di&s;advantage, than any Particular that was contained in the Charge
that had been offered to the Hou&s;e. And therefore though He forbore,
when all the Promi&s;es were broken which had been made to him, and his
Enemies Malice and In&s;olence increa&s;ed by his Ab&s;ence, to publi&s;h or in the
lea&s;t Degree to communicate the true Ground and Rea&s;ons of ab&s;enting
him&s;elf, to avoid any Inconvenience that in &s;o captious a Sea&s;on might
<MILESTONE N="30">thereby have befallen the King's Service; yet it cannot be thought unrea&s;on|able
to pre&s;erve this Memorial of all the Circum&s;tances, as well as the &s;ub|&s;tantial
Rea&s;ons, which di&s;po&s;ed him to make that Flight, for the clear In|formation
of tho&s;e, who in a fit Sea&s;on may under&s;tand his Innocence with|out
any Inconvenience to his Maje&s;ty, of who&s;e Goodne&s;s and Honour and
Ju&s;tice it may be hoped, that his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf will give his own Te&s;ti|mony,
both of this Particular of his withdrawing, and a Vindication of his In|nocence
from all the other Reproaches with which it was a&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P>I WILL not omit one other Particular,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An In&s;tance of his generous Behaviour to his Enemies.</NOTE> for the Manife&s;tation of the Ine|quality
that was between the Nature of the Chancellor and of his Enemies,
<MILESTONE N="40">and upon what Di&s;advantage He was to contend with them. Before the
Meeting of the Parliament, when it was well known that the Combination
was entered into by the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> and Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> again&s;t
the Chancellor, &s;everal Members of the Hou&s;e informed him of what They
did and what They &s;aid, and told him, &startq;that there was but one Way
to prevent the Prejudice intended towards him, which was by falling
fir&s;t upon them; which They would cau&s;e to be done, if He would
a&s;&s;i&s;t them with &s;uch Information as it could not but be in his Power
to do. That They were Both very odious generally: The one for his
in&s;olent Carriage towards all Men, and for the Manner of his getting into
<MILESTONE N="50">that Office by di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an old faithful Servant, who was forced to part
with it for a very good Recompen&s;e of ten thou&s;and Pounds in Money and
other Relea&s;es and Grants, which was paid and made by the King to in|troduce
a Secretary of very mean Parts, and without Indu&s;try to improve
<PB N="458" REF="464">
them, and one who was generally &s;u&s;pected to be a Papi&s;t, or without any
Religion at all; it being generally taken Notice of, that He was rarely
&s;een in a Church, and never known to receive the Communion. The
other was known by his corrupt Behaviour, and felling all the Offices in
the Fleet and Navy for incredible Sums of Money, and thereby introduc|ing
Men, who had been mo&s;t employed and tru&s;ted by <HI>Cromwell,</HI> into
the &s;everal Offices; whil&s;t loyal and faithful Seamen who had always ad|hered
to the King, and many of them continued in his Service abroad and
till his Return into <HI>England,</HI> could not be admitted into any Employ|ment:
The ill Con&s;equence of which to the King's Service was very no|torious,<MILESTONE N="10">
by the daily manife&s;t &s;tealing and embezzling the Stores of
Ammunition, Cordage, Sails, and other Tackling, which were com|monly
&s;old again to the King at great Prices. And when the Per&s;ons
guilty of this were taken Notice of and apprehended, They talked loudly
of the Sums They had paid for their Offices, which obliged them to tho&s;e
Frauds: And that it might not be more notorious, They were, by Sir
<HI>William Coventry's</HI> great Power and Intere&s;t, never proceeded again&s;t, or
removed from their Offices and Employments.&endq;</P>
<P>THEY told him, &startq;that He never &s;aid or did any Thing in the mo&s;t &s;ecret
Council, where They two were always pre&s;ent, and where there were fre|quent<MILESTONE N="20">
Occa&s;ions of mentioning the Proceedings of Both Hou&s;es, and the
Behaviour of &s;everal Members in Both, but tho&s;e Gentlemen declared the
&s;ame, and all that He &s;aid or did, to tho&s;e who would be mo&s;t offended and
incen&s;ed by it, and who were like in &s;ome Conjuncture to be able to do
him mo&s;t Mi&s;chief: And by tho&s;e ill Arts They had irreconciled many
Per&s;ons to him. And that if He would now, without its being po&s;&s;ible
to be taken Notice of, give them &s;uch Information and Light into the
Proceedings of tho&s;e Gentlemen, They would undertake to divert the
Storm that threatened him, and cau&s;e it to fall upon the others.&endq; And
this was with much Earne&s;tne&s;s pre&s;&s;ed to him, not only before the Meeting of<MILESTONE N="30">
the Parliament, and when He was fully informed of the ill Arts and un|gentlemanly
Practice tho&s;e two Per&s;ons were engaged in to do him Hurt, but
after the Hou&s;e of Commons was incen&s;ed again&s;t him; with a full A&s;&s;urance,
&startq;that They were much inclined to have accu&s;ed the other two, if the lea&s;t
Occa&s;ion was given for it.&endq;</P>
<P>BUT the Chancellor would not be prevailed with, &s;aying, &startq;that no Pro|vocation
or Example &s;hould di&s;po&s;e him to do any Thing that would not
become him: That They were Both Privy Coun&s;ellors, and tru&s;ted by the
King in his mo&s;t weighty Affairs; and if He di&s;cerned any Thing ami&s;s in
them, He could inform the King of it. But the a&s;per&s;ing or accu&s;ing<MILESTONE N="40">
them any where el&s;e was not his Part to do, nor could it be done by any
without &s;ome Reflection upon the King and Duke, who would be much
offended at it: And therefore He advi&s;ed them in no Degree to make any
&s;uch Attempt on his Behalf; but to leave him to the Protection of his own
Innocence and of God's good Plea&s;ure, and tho&s;e Gentlemen to their own
Fate, which at &s;ome Time would humble them.&endq; And it is known to
many Per&s;ons, and po&s;&s;ibly to the King him&s;elf, for who&s;e Service only that
Office was performed, that one or Both tho&s;e Per&s;ons had before that Time
been impeached, if the Chancellor's &s;ole Indu&s;try and Intere&s;t had not divert|ed
and prevented it.<MILESTONE N="50"></P>
<P>WHEN the Chancellor found it nece&s;&s;ary, for the Rea&s;ons afore&s;aid, to
withdraw him&s;elf, He thought it as nece&s;&s;ary to leave &s;ome Addre&s;s to the
Hou&s;e of Peers, and to make as good an Excu&s;e as He could for his Ab&s;ence
<PB N="459" REF="465">
without a&s;king their Leave; which &s;hould be delivered to them by &s;ome
Member of their Body (there being many of them ready to perform that civil
Office for him), when his Ab&s;ence &s;hould be known, or &s;ome Evidence that He
was &s;afely arrived on the other Side of the Sea. And that Time being come
(for the Packet Boat was ready to depart when the Chancellor landed at <HI>Ca|lais,</HI>

&startq;MAY it plea&s;e your Lord&s;hips,&endq;</Q>
<P>&startq;I CANNOT expre&s;s the in&s;upportable Trouble and Grief of Mind I &s;u&s;tain,
under the Apprehen&s;ion of being mi&s;repre&s;ented to your Lord&s;hips; and
when I hear how much of your Lord&s;hips Time hath been &s;pent upon my
poor Concern (though it be of no le&s;s than of my Life and Fortune), and
of the Differences in Opinion which have already or may probably ari&s;e be|tween
your Lord&s;hips and the honourable Hou&s;e of Commons; whereby
<MILESTONE N="20">the great and weighty Affairs of the Kingdom may be ob&s;tructed in a
Time of &s;o general a Di&s;&s;atisfaction.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I AM very unfortunate to find my&s;elf to &s;uffer &s;o much under two very
di&s;advantageous Reflections, which are in no Degree applicable to me:
The fir&s;t, from the Greatne&s;s of my E&s;tate and Fortune, collected and
made in &s;o few Years; which, if it be proportionable to what is reported,
may very rea&s;onably cau&s;e my Integrity to be &s;u&s;pected. The &s;econd,
that I have been the &s;ole Manager and chief Mini&s;ter in all the Tran&s;ac|tions
of State, &s;ince the King's Return into <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> la&s;t; and
therefore that all Mi&s;carriages and Misfortunes ought to be imputed to me,
<MILESTONE N="30">and to my Coun&s;els.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;CONCERNING my E&s;tate, your Lord&s;hips will not believe, that after
Malice and Envy hath been &s;o inqui&s;itive, and is &s;o &s;harp&s;ighted, I will
offer any Thing to your Lord&s;hips but what is exactly true: And I do a&s;|&s;ure
your Lord&s;hips in the fir&s;t Place, that, excepting from the King's
Bounty, I have never received or taken one Penny, but what was gene|rally
under&s;tood to be the ju&s;t and lawful Perqui&s;ites of my Office by the
con&s;tant Practice of the be&s;t Times, which I did in my own Judgment con|ceive
to be that of my Lord <HI>Coventry</HI> and my Lord <HI>Elle&s;mere,</HI> the Practice
of which I con&s;tantly ob&s;erved; although the Office in Both their Times
<MILESTONE N="40">was lawfully worth double to what it was to me, and I believe now is.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;THAT all the Courte&s;ies and Favours, which I have been able to ob|tain
from the King for other Per&s;ons in Church or State or in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI>
have never been worth me five Pound: So that your Lord&s;hips
may be confident I am as innocent from Corruption, as from any di&s;loyal
Thought; which, after near thirty Years Service of the Crown in &s;ome
Difficulties and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, I did never &s;u&s;pect would have been objected
to me in my Age.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;THAT I am at pre&s;ent indebted about three or four and twenty
thou&s;and Pounds, for which I pay Intere&s;t; the Particulars whereof
<MILESTONE N="50">I &s;hall be ready to offer to your Lord&s;hips, and for which I have a&s;&s;igned
Lands and Lea&s;es to be &s;old, though at pre&s;ent Nobody will buy or &s;ell
with me. That I am &s;o far from having Money, that from the Time the
Seal was taken from me I have lived upon the coining &s;ome &s;mall Parcels
<PB N="460" REF="466">
of Plate, which have &s;u&s;tained me and my Family, all my Rents being
withheld from me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;THAT my E&s;tate, my Debts being paid, will not yield me two thou|&s;and
Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> for the Support of my&s;elf, and providing for two
young Children, who have Nothing: And that all I have is not worth
what the King in his Bounty hath be&s;towed upon me, his Maje&s;ty having
out of his Royal Bounty, within few Months after his coming into <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
at one Time be&s;towed upon me twenty thou&s;and Pounds in ready
Money, without the lea&s;t Motion or Imagination of mine; and, &s;hortly
after, another Sum of Money, amounting to &s;ix thou&s;and Pounds or there|abouts,<MILESTONE N="10">
out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> which ought to have amounted to a much greater
Proportion, and of which I never heard Word, till Notice was given me
by the Earl of <HI>Orrery</HI> that there was &s;uch a Sum of Money for me. His
Maje&s;ty likewi&s;e a&s;&s;igned me after the fir&s;t Year of his Return an annual
Supply towards my Support, which did but defray my Expen&s;es, the cer|tain
Profits of my Office not amounting to above two thou&s;and Pounds a
Year or thereabouts, and the Perqui&s;ites not very con&s;iderable and very
uncertain: So that the &s;aid &s;everal Sums of Money, and &s;ome Parcels of
Land his Maje&s;ty be&s;towed upon me, are worth more than all I have
amounts to. So far I am from advancing my E&s;tate by any indirect<MILESTONE N="20">
Means. And though this Bounty of his Maje&s;ty hath very far exceeded
my Merit or my Expectation; yet &s;ome others have been as fortunate
at lea&s;t in the &s;ame Bounty, who had as &s;mall Pretences to it, and have
no great Rea&s;on to envy my good Fortune.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;CONCERNING the other Imputation, of the Credit and Power of being
chief Mini&s;ter, and &s;o cau&s;ing all to be done that I had a Mind to; I
have no more to &s;ay, than that I had the good Fortune to &s;erve a Ma&s;ter
of a very great Judgment and Under&s;tanding, and to be always joined
with Per&s;ons of great Ability and Experience, without who&s;e Advice and
Concurrence never any Thing hath been done. Before his Maje&s;ty's com|ing<MILESTONE N="30">
into <HI>England,</HI> He was con&s;tantly attended by the then Marquis of <HI>Or|mond,</HI>
the late Lord <HI>Colepepper,</HI> and Mr. Secretary <HI>Nicholas;</HI> who were
equally tru&s;ted with my&s;elf, and without who&s;e joint Advice and Con|currence,
when They were all pre&s;ent (as &s;ome of them always were), I
never gave any Coun&s;el.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;AS &s;oon as it plea&s;ed God to bring his Maje&s;ty into <HI>England,</HI> He e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
his Privy Council, and &s;hortly out of them a Number of honour|able
Per&s;ons of great Reputation, who for the mo&s;t Part are &s;till alive, as
a Committee for foreign Affairs, and Con&s;ideration of &s;uch Things as in
the Nature of them required much Secrecy; and with the&s;e Per&s;ons He<MILESTONE N="40">
vouch&s;afed to join me. And I am confident this Committee never tran&s;|acted
any Thing of Moment, his Maje&s;ty being always pre&s;ent, without
pre&s;enting the &s;ame fir&s;t to the Council-Board: And I mu&s;t appeal to
them concerning my Carriage, and whether We were not all of one
Mind in all Matters of Importance. For more than two Years I never
knew any Difference in the Councils, or that there were any Complaints
in the Kingdom; which I wholly impute to his Maje&s;ty's great Wi&s;dom,
and the entire Concurrence of his Council, without the Vanity of a&s;&s;uming
any Thing to my&s;elf: And therefore I hope I &s;hall not be &s;ingly charged
with any Thing that hath &s;ince fallen out ami&s;s. But from the Time that<MILESTONE N="50">
Mr. Secretary <HI>Nicholas</HI> was removed from his Place, there were great Altera|tions;
and who&s;oever knows any Thing of the Court or Councils, knows
well how much my Credit &s;ince that Time hath been dimini&s;hed, though
<PB N="461" REF="467">
his Maje&s;ty graciou&s;ly vouch&s;afed &s;till to hear my Advice in mo&s;t of his
Affairs. Nor hath there been, from that Time to this, above one or two
Per&s;ons brought to the Council, or preferred to any con&s;iderable Office in
the Court, who have been of my intimate Acquaintance, or &s;u&s;pected to
have any Kindne&s;s for me; and many of them notoriou&s;ly known to
have been very long my Enemies, and of different Judgment and Principles
from me both in Church and State, and who have taken all Opportuni|ties
to le&s;&s;en my Credit to the King, and with all other Per&s;ons, by mi&s;|repre&s;enting
and mi&s;reporting all that I &s;aid or did, and per&s;uading Men
<MILESTONE N="10">that I had done them &s;ome Prejudice with his Maje&s;ty, or cro&s;&s;ed them
in &s;ome of their Pretences; though his Maje&s;ty's Goodne&s;s and Ju&s;tice was
&s;uch, that it made little Impre&s;&s;ion upon him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;IN my humble Opinion, the great Misfortunes of the Kingdom have
proceeded from the War, to which it is notoriou&s;ly known that I was
always aver&s;e; and may without Vanity &s;ay, I did not only fore&s;ee but did
declare the Mi&s;chie&s;s We &s;hould run into, by entering into a War before
any Alliance made with the neighbour Princes. And that it may not be
imputed to his Maje&s;ty's Want of Care, or the Negligence of his Coun|&s;ellors,
that no &s;uch Alliances were entered into; I mu&s;t take the Bold|ne&s;s
<MILESTONE N="20">to &s;ay, that his Maje&s;ty left Nothing unattempted in Order thereunto:
And knowing very well, that <HI>France</HI> re&s;olved to begin a War upon <HI>Spain,</HI>
as &s;oon as his <HI>Catholick</HI> Maje&s;ty &s;hould depart this World (which being
much &s;ooner expected by them, They had two Winters before been at
great Charge in providing plentiful Magazines of all Provi&s;ions upon the
Frontiers, that They might be ready for the War), his Maje&s;ty u&s;ed all
po&s;&s;ible Means to prepare and di&s;po&s;e the <HI>Spaniard</HI> to that Apprehen&s;ion,
offering his Friend&s;hip to that Degree, as might be for the Security and
Benefit of Both Crowns. But <HI>Spain</HI> flattering it&s;elf with an Opinion that
<HI>France</HI> would not break with them, at lea&s;t, that They would not give
<MILESTONE N="30">them any Cau&s;e by admini&s;tering Matter of Jealou&s;y to them, never made
any real Approach towards a Friend&s;hip with his Maje&s;ty; but both by
their Amba&s;&s;adour here, and to his Maje&s;ty's Amba&s;&s;adour at <HI>Madrid,</HI>
always in&s;i&s;ted, as Preliminaries, upon the giving up of <HI>Dunkirk, Tangier,</HI>
and <HI>Jamaica.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;THOUGH <HI>France</HI> had an Amba&s;&s;adour here, to whom a Project for a
Treaty was offered, and the Lord <HI>Hollis,</HI> his Maje&s;ty's Amba&s;&s;adour at
<HI>Paris,</HI> u&s;ed all Endeavours to promote and pro&s;ecute the &s;aid Treaty; yet
it was quickly di&s;cerned, that the principal De&s;ign of <HI>France</HI> was to draw
his Maje&s;ty into &s;uch a nearer Alliance as might advance their De&s;igns;
<MILESTONE N="40">without which They had no Mind to enter into the Treaty propo&s;ed. And
this was the State of Affairs when the War was entered into with the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> from which Time neither Crown much con&s;idered their making
an Alliance with <HI>England.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;AS I did from my Soul abhor the entering into this War, &s;o I never
pre&s;umed to give any Advice or Coun&s;el for the Way of managing it, but
by oppo&s;ing many Propo&s;itions which &s;eemed to the late Lord Trea&s;urer
and my&s;elf to be unrea&s;onable, as the Payment of the Seamen by Tickets,
and many other Particulars which added to the Expen&s;e. My Enemies took
all Occa&s;ions to inveigh again&s;t me: And making Friend&s;hip with others
<MILESTONE N="50">out of the Council of more licentious Principles, and who knew well
enough how much I di&s;liked and complained of the Liberty They took to
them&s;elves of reviling all Councils and Coun&s;ellors, and turning all Things
&s;erious and &s;acred into Ridicule; They took all Ways imaginable to render
<PB N="462" REF="468">
me ingrateful to all Sorts of Men (whom I &s;hall be compelled to name in
my own Defence), per&s;uading tho&s;e who mi&s;carried in any of their De&s;igns,
that it was the Chancellor's doing; whereof I never knew any Thing.
However They could not withdraw the King's Favour from me, who was
&s;till plea&s;ed to u&s;e my Service with others; nor was there ever any Thing
done but upon the joint Advice of at lea&s;t the major Part of tho&s;e who
were con&s;ulted with. And as his Maje&s;ty commanded my Service in the
late Treaties, &s;o I never gave the lea&s;t Advice in private, nor writ one
Letter to any Per&s;on in either of tho&s;e Negotiations, but upon the Advice
of the Council, and after it was read in Council, or at lea&s;t by the King<MILESTONE N="10">
him&s;elf and &s;ome others: And if I prepared any In&s;tructions or Memo|rials,
it was by the King's Command, and the Reque&s;t of the Secretaries,
who de&s;ired my A&s;&s;i&s;tance. Nor was it any Wi&s;h of my own, that any
Amba&s;&s;adours &s;hould give me an Account of the Tran&s;actions, but to the
Secretaries, with whom I was always ready to advi&s;e; nor am I con&s;cious
to my&s;elf of having ever given Advice that hath proved mi&s;chievous or in|convenient
to his Maje&s;ty. And I have been &s;o far from being the &s;ole
Manager of Affairs, that I have not in the whole la&s;t Year been above twice
with his Maje&s;ty in any Room alone, and very &s;eldom in the two or three
Years preceding. And &s;ince the Parliament at <HI>Oxford,</HI> it hath been very<MILESTONE N="20">
vi&s;ible that my Credit hath been very little, and that very few Things have
been hearkened to which have been propo&s;ed by me, but contradicted <HI>eo
Nomine,</HI> becau&s;e propo&s;ed by me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I MOST humbly be&s;eech your Lord&s;hips to remember the Office and
Tru&s;t I had for &s;even Years; in which, in Di&s;charge of my Duty, I was
obliged to &s;top and ob&s;truct many Mens Pretences, and to refu&s;e to &s;er
the Seal to many Pardons and other Grants, which would have been pro|fitable
to tho&s;e who procured them, and many whereof, upon my Repre|&s;entation
to his Maje&s;ty, were for ever &s;topped; which naturally have
rai&s;ed many Enemies to me. And my frequent concurring with the late<MILESTONE N="30">
Lord Trea&s;urer, with whom I had the Honour to have a long and a fa&s;t
Friend&s;hip to his Death, in repre&s;enting &s;everal Exce&s;&s;es and Exorbitances
(the yearly I&s;&s;ues &s;o far exceeding the Revenue), provoked many Per&s;ons
concerned, of great Power and Credit, to do me all the ill Offices They
could. And yet I may faithfully &s;ay, that I never meddled with any Part
of the Revenue or the Admini&s;tration of it, but when I was de&s;ired by
the late Lord Trea&s;urer to give him my A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Advice (having
had the Honour formerly to &s;erve the Crown as Chancellor of the Exche|quer),
which was for the mo&s;t Part in his Maje&s;ty's Pre&s;ence: Nor have
I ever been in the lea&s;t Degree concerned in Point of Profit in the let|ting<MILESTONE N="40">
any Part of his Maje&s;ty's Revenue, nor have ever treated or debated
it but in his Maje&s;ty's Pre&s;ence; in which, my Opinion concurred al|ways
with the major Part of the Coun&s;ellors who were pre&s;ent. All
which, upon Examination, will be made manife&s;t to your Lord&s;hips,
how much &s;oever my Integrity is bla&s;ted by the Malice of tho&s;e, who I
am confident do not believe them&s;elves. Nor have I in my Life, upon
all the Treaties or otherwi&s;e, received the Value of one Shilling from all
the Kings and Princes in the World (except the Books of the <HI>Louvre</HI>
Print &s;ent me by the Chancellor of <HI>France</HI> by that King's Direction), but
from my own Ma&s;ter; to who&s;e entire Service, and to the Good and<MILESTONE N="50">
Welfare of my Country, no Man's Heart was ever more devoted.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;THIS being my pre&s;ent Condition, I do mo&s;t humbly be&s;eech your
Lord&s;hips to retain a favourable Opinion of me, and to believe me to be
<PB N="463" REF="469">
innocent from tho&s;e &s;oul A&s;per&s;ions, until the Contrary &s;hall be proved;
which I am &s;ure can never be by any Man worthy to be believed. And
&s;ince the Di&s;temper of the Time, and the Difference between the two
Hou&s;es in the pre&s;ent Debate, with the Power and Malice of my Enemies,
who give out, that I &s;hall prevail with his Maje&s;ty to prorogue or di&s;|&s;olve
this Parliament in Di&s;plea&s;ure, and threaten to expo&s;e me to the
Rage and Fury of the People, may make me looked upon as the
Cau&s;e which ob&s;tructs the King's Service, and the Unity and Peace of the
Kingdom; I mu&s;t humbly be&s;eech your Lord&s;hips, that I may not for|feit
<MILESTONE N="10">your Lord&s;hips Favour and Protection, by withdrawing my&s;elf from
&s;o powerful a Per&s;ecution; in Hopes I may be able, by &s;uch withdrawing,
hereafter to appear, and make my Defence; when his Maje&s;ty's Ju&s;tice,
to which I &s;hall always &s;ubmit, may not be ob&s;tructed nor controlled by
the Power and Malioe of tho&s;e who have &s;worn my De&s;truction.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Chancellor knew very well, that there were Members enough in Both
Hou&s;es who would be very glad to take any Advantage of his Words and Ex|pre&s;&s;ions:
And therefore as He weighed them the be&s;t He could him&s;elf in
the &s;hort Time from which He took his Re&s;olution to be gone; &s;o He con|&s;ulted
<MILESTONE N="20">with as many Friends as that Time would allow, to the End that
their Jealou&s;y and Warine&s;s might better watch, that no Expre&s;&s;ion might
be liable to a &s;ini&s;ter Interpretation, than his own Pa&s;&s;ion and Indi&s;po&s;ition
could provide. And as They all thought it nece&s;&s;ary that He &s;hould leave
Somewhat behind him, that might offer an Excu&s;e for his Ab&s;ence; &s;o They
did not conceive, that the Words before mentioned could give any Offence
to equal Judges. But the lea&s;t Variety or Change of Wind moved tho&s;e
Waters to wonderful Di&s;tempers and Tempe&s;ts.</P>
<P>THIS Addre&s;s was no &s;ooner read, by which They perceived He was gone,
but They who had contributed mo&s;t to the ab&s;enting him&s;elf, and were
<MILESTONE N="30">privy to all the Promi&s;es which had invited him to it, &s;eemed much troubled
that He had e&s;caped their Ju&s;tice; and moved, &startq;that Orders might be forth|with
&s;ent to &s;top the Ports, that &s;o He might be apprehended;&endq; when They
well knew that He was landed at <HI>Calais.</HI> Others took Exceptions at &s;ome
Expre&s;&s;ions, &startq;which,&endq; They &s;aid, &startq;reflected upon the King's Honour and
Ju&s;tice:&endq; Others moved, &startq;that it might be entered in their Journal|Book,
to the End that They might farther con&s;ider of it when They &s;hould
think fit;&endq; and this was ordered.</P>
<P>THE Hou&s;es till this Time had continued ob&s;tinate in their &s;everal Re&s;o|lutions;
the Commons every Day pre&s;&s;ing, &startq;that He might be committed
<MILESTONE N="40">upon their general Accu&s;ation of Trea&s;on&endq; (for though They had among&s;t
them&s;elves and from their Committee offered tho&s;e Particulars which are
mentioned before, yet They pre&s;ented none to the Hou&s;e of Peers); and
the Lords as po&s;itively refu&s;ing to commit him, till &s;ome Charge &s;hould be
pre&s;ented again&s;t him that amounted to Trea&s;on. But now all that Debate
was at an End by his being out of their Reach, &s;o that They pur&s;ued that
Point no farther; which, being Matter of Privilege, &s;hould have been de|termined
as nece&s;&s;arily as before, for the Prevention of the like Di&s;putes here|after.
But the Commons wi&s;ely declined that Contention, well knowing
that their Party in the Hou&s;e, that was very pa&s;&s;ionate for the Commitment

re&s;t had been: And the Lords &s;atisfied them&s;elves with &s;ending a Me&s;&s;age to
the Hou&s;e of Commons, &startq;that They found by the Addre&s;s which They had
received that Morning, and which They likewi&s;e imparted to them, that
<PB N="464" REF="470">
the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> had withdrawn him&s;elf; and &s;o there was no far|ther
Occa&s;ion of Debate upon that Point.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Addre&s;s was no &s;ooner read in that Hou&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Apology burned by Or|der of Both Hou&s;es.</NOTE> but They who had in|du&s;triou&s;ly
promoted the former Re&s;olution were inflamed, as if this very
In&s;trument would contribute enough to any Thing that was wanting; and
They &s;everally arraigned it, and inveighed again&s;t the Per&s;on who had &s;ent
it with all imaginable Bitterne&s;s and In&s;olence: Whil&s;t others, who could
not in the hearing it read ob&s;erve that Malignity that it was accu&s;ed of,
&s;ate &s;till and &s;ilent, as if They &s;u&s;pected that Somewhat had e&s;caped their
Ob&s;ervations and Di&s;covery, that &s;o much tran&s;ported other Men; or be|cau&s;e<MILESTONE N="10">
They were well plea&s;ed that a Per&s;on, again&s;t whom there was &s;o
much Malice and Fury profe&s;&s;ed, was got out of their Reach. In Con|clu&s;ion,
after long Debate it was concluded, &startq;that the Paper contained
much Untruth and Scandal and Sedition in it, and that it &s;hould
be publickly burned by the Hand of the Hangman;&endq; which Vote
They pre&s;ently &s;ent to the Lords for their Concurrence, who, though They
had not ob&s;erved any &s;uch Guilt in it before, would maintain no further
Conte&s;ts with them, and &s;o concurred in the Sentence: And the poor
Paper was accordingly with Solemnity executed by the appointed Officer,
which made the more People inqui&s;itive into the Contents of it; and hav|ing<MILESTONE N="20">
gotten Copies of it, They took upon them to cen&s;ure the Thing and
the Per&s;on with much more Clemency and Compa&s;&s;ion, and thought He
had done well to decline &s;uch angry Judges.</P>
<P>WHEN the Chancellor found him&s;elf at <HI>Calais,</HI> He was unre&s;olved how
to di&s;po&s;e of him&s;elf, only that He would not go to <HI>Paris,</HI> again&s;t which
He was able to make many Objections: And in this Irre&s;olution He knew
not how to &s;end any Directions to his Children in <HI>England,</HI> to what Place
They &s;hould &s;end his Servants and &s;uch other Accommodations as He
&s;hould want; and therefore &s;tayed there till He might be better informed,
and know Somewhat of the Temper of the Parliament. In the mean Time<MILESTONE N="30">
He writ Letters to the Earl of <HI>St. Albans</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> from who&s;e very late
Profe&s;&s;ions He had Rea&s;on to expect Civility, and that was all He did ex|pect;
never imagining that He &s;hould receive any Grace from the Queen,
or that it was fit for him to ca&s;t him&s;elf at her Feet, whil&s;t He was in his
Maje&s;ty's Di&s;plea&s;ure.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Chancellor writes to the</HI> French-<HI>Court for Leave to remove to</HI> Roan.</NOTE> Only He de&s;ired to know, &startq;whether there would

Adverti&s;ement, and, &startq;that a Coach would be ready at <HI>Abbeville</HI> to wait<MILESTONE N="50">
for him at the Day He had appointed.&endq;</P>
<P>AND now He thought He might well take his Re&s;olution;<NOTE PLACE="marg">He begins his Journey.</NOTE> and there|upon
gave Direction, &startq;that &s;uch of his Family, who&s;e Attendance He
<PB N="465" REF="471">
could not be well without, might with all Expedition be with him at
<HI>Roan;</HI> and &s;uch Monies might be likewi&s;e returned thither for him, as
were nece&s;&s;ary,&endq; for He had not brought with him Supply enough for
long Time. And &s;o He provided to leave <HI>Calais,</HI> that He might be warm
in his Winter-Quarters as &s;oon as might be, which both the Sea&s;on of the
Year, it being now within few Days of <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> and his Expectation
of a &s;peedy Defluxion of the Gout, made very requi&s;ite. When He came
to <HI>Boulogne,</HI> He found Orders from the Mar&s;hal <HI>D' Aumont</HI> to his Lieute|nant
for a Guard to <HI>Montrevil,</HI> the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Garri&s;ons making frequent In|cur&s;ions
<MILESTONE N="10">into tho&s;e Quarters: And at <HI>Montrevil</HI> the Duke <HI>D' Elboeuf</HI> vi&s;ited
him, and invited him to Supper, which the Chancellor was &s;o much tired
with his Journey that He accepted not; but was not &s;uffered to refu&s;e his
Coach the next Day to <HI>Abbeville,</HI> where He found a Coach from <HI>Paris</HI>
ready to carry him to <HI>Roan.</HI></P>
<P>IT was <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> Eve when He came to <HI>Dieppe,</HI> and it was a long
Journey the next Day to <HI>Roan;</HI> which made him &s;end to the Governour,
to de&s;ire that the Ports might be open much &s;ooner than their Hour,
which was granted: So that He came to a very ill Inn well known at
<HI>To&s;tes,</HI> near the middle Way to <HI>Roan,</HI> about Noon. And when He was
<MILESTONE N="20">within View of that Place, a Gentleman, pa&s;&s;ing by in a good Gallop with
a Couple of Servants, a&s;ked, &startq;whether the Chancellor of <HI>England</HI> was
in that Coach;&endq; and being an&s;wered &startq;that He was,&endq; He alighted at the
Coach-Side, and gave him a Letter from the King, which contained only
Credit to what that Gentleman, <HI>Mon&s;ieur Le Fonde,</HI> his Servant in Ordinary,
&s;hould &s;ay to him from his Maje&s;ty. The Gentleman, after &s;ome Expre&s;|&s;ions
of his Maje&s;ty's Grace and good Opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But receives on the Way Orders to leave <HI>France</HI> in&s;tantly.</NOTE> told him, &startq;that the King
had lately received Adverti&s;ement from his Envoy in <HI>England, that the
Parliament there was &s;o much incen&s;ed again&s;t him, the Chancellor, that if
He &s;hould be &s;uffered to &s;tay in</HI> France, <HI>it would be &s;o prejudicial to the
<MILESTONE N="30">Affairs of his</HI> Chri&s;tian <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> (to whom He was confident the Chancellor
wi&s;hed well), <HI>that it might make a Breach between the two Crowns:</HI> And
therefore He de&s;ired him to make what Speed He could out of his Do|minions;
and that He might want no Accommodation for his Journey,
that Gentleman was to accompany him till He &s;aw him out of <HI>France.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>HE was marvellou&s;ly &s;truck with this Encounter, which He looked not
for, nor could re&s;olve what to do, being at Liberty to make his Journey
which Way He would &s;o He re&s;ted not, which was the only Thing He
de&s;ired: So He de&s;ired the Gentleman (for all this Conver&s;ation was in the
Highway) &startq;to come into the Coach, and to accompany him to <HI>Roan,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="40">where They would confer farther.&endq; The Gentleman, though He was
a very civil Per&s;on, &s;eemed to think that it would be better to return
to <HI>Dieppe,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Calais,</HI> as the &s;horte&s;t Way out of <HI>France:</HI> But
He had no Commi&s;&s;ion to urge that, and &s;o conde&s;cended to go that
Night to <HI>Roan;</HI> with a Declaration, &startq;that it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to be
the next Day very early in the Coach, which Way &s;oever He in|tended
to make his Journey.&endq;</P>
<P>IT was late in the Night before They reached <HI>Roan:</HI> And the Coach was
overthrown three Times in the Gentleman's Sight, who cho&s;e to ride his
Hor&s;e; &s;o that the Chancellor was really hurt and brui&s;ed, and &s;carce able
<MILESTONE N="50">to &s;et his Foot to the Ground. And therefore He told the Gentleman
plainly, &startq;that He could not make any Journey the next Day: But that
He would pre&s;ently write to <HI>Paris</HI> to a Friend,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He repre&s;ents his ill State of Health to the Court.</NOTE> who &s;hould inform the
King of the ill Condition He was in, and de&s;ire &s;ome Time of Re&s;t;
<PB N="466" REF="472">
and that as &s;oon as He had fini&s;hed his Letter, He would &s;end an Ex|pre&s;s
with it, who &s;hould make all po&s;&s;ible Ha&s;te in going and coming.&endq;
<HI>Mon&s;ieur Le Fonde</HI> a&s;&s;ured him, &startq;the Matter was &s;o fully re&s;olved, that no
Writing would procure any Time to &s;tay in <HI>France;</HI> and therefore de&s;ired
him to ha&s;ten his Journey, which Way &s;oever He intended it.&endq; But when
He &s;aw there was no Remedy, He likewi&s;e writ to the Court, and the
Chancellor to the Earl of <HI>St. Albans,</HI> from whom He thought He &s;hould
receive Offices of Humanity, and to another Friend, upon who&s;e Affection
He more depended: And with tho&s;e Letters the Expre&s;s was di&s;patched.</P>
<P>THEY who had prevailed &s;o far again&s;t him in <HI>England</HI> were not yet &s;a|tisfied,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Occa&s;ion of his ill Treatment in</HI> France.</NOTE><MILESTONE N="10">
but contrived tho&s;e Ways to di&s;quiet him as much in <HI>France,</HI> by
telling <HI>Mon&s;ieur Ruvigny</HI> (who was too ea&s;ily di&s;po&s;ed to believe them),&startq;
that the Parliament was &s;o much offended with the Chancellor, that it
would never con&s;ent that the King &s;hould enter into a clo&s;e and firm Al|liance
with <HI>France,</HI>&endq; which it was his Bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;olicit, &startq;whil&s;t He
&s;hould be permitted to &s;tay within that Kingdom:&endq; When in Truth all
the Malice again&s;t him was contained within the Brea&s;ts of few Men, who
by incen&s;ing the King, and infu&s;ing many fal&s;e and groundle&s;s Relations
into him, drew &s;uch a numerous Party to contribute to their Ends.</P>
<P>WHEN He was now gone,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Proceedings again&s;t him in</HI> England.</NOTE> They ob&s;erved to the King, &startq;what a great<MILESTONE N="20">
Faction there was in Both Hou&s;es that adhered to the Chancellor,&endq; who
were called <HI>Clarendonians;</HI> and when any Oppo&s;ition was made to any
Thing that was propo&s;ed, as frequently there was, &startq;it was always done by
the <HI>Clarendonians:</HI>&endq; Who&s;e Condition They thought was not de&s;perate
enough, except They proceeded farther than was yet done. They laboured
with all their Power, that He might be attainted of High Trea&s;on by Act
of Parliament, and that Both his Sons might be removed from the Court:
Both which, notwith&s;tanding all their Importunity, his Maje&s;ty po&s;itively re|fu&s;ed
to con&s;ent to. Then They told him, &startq;that the Chancellor only waited
the Sea&s;on that the Parliament &s;hould be confirmed in ill Humour, to<MILESTONE N="30">
which They were inclined; and then He would return and fit in the
Hou&s;e to di&s;turb all their Coun&s;els, and ob&s;truct all his Service: And
therefore They propo&s;ed, &s;ince He had fled from the Hand of Ju&s;tice,
that there could be no more Pro&s;ecution for his Guilt&endq; (which was untrue,
for They might as well have proceeded and proved the Crimes objected
again&s;t him if They could), &startq;a Bill of Bani&s;hment,&endq; which They had pre|pared,
&startq;might be brought in again&s;t him;&endq; which his Maje&s;ty con&s;ented
to, notwith&s;tanding all that the Duke of <HI>York</HI> urged to the Contrary upon
the King's Promi&s;e to him, and which had only betrayed the Chancellor
to making his E&s;cape. But the King alleged, &startq;that the Conde&s;cen&s;ion<MILESTONE N="40">
was nece&s;&s;ary for his Good, and to compound with tho&s;e who would el&s;e
pre&s;s that which would be more mi&s;chievous to him.&endq;</P>
<P>WHEREUPON a Bill for his Bani&s;hment was preferred,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bill of Ba|ni&s;hment pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t him.</NOTE> only upon his having
declined the Proceeding of Ju&s;tice by his Flight, without &s;o much as en|deavouring
to prove one of the Crimes They had charged upon him: And
this Bill was pa&s;&s;ed by the two Hou&s;es, and confirmed by the King; of whom
They had yet &s;o much Jealou&s;y, that They left it not in his Power to pardon
him without the Con&s;ent of the two Hou&s;es of Parliament. And this Act
was to be ab&s;olute, &startq;except by a Day appointed&endq; (which was &s;o &s;hort, that
it was hardly po&s;&s;ible for him to comply with it, except He could have rode<MILESTONE N="50">
Po&s;t) &startq;He &s;hould appear before one of the Secretaries of State, or deliver
him&s;elf to the Lieutenant of the <HI>Tower,</HI> who was detain him in Cu&s;tody
till He had acquainted the Parliament with it: In the mean Time no
<PB N="467" REF="473">
Per&s;on was to pre&s;ume to hold any Corre&s;pondence with him or to write
to him, except his own Children or his menial Servants, who were obliged
to &s;hew the Letters which They &s;ent or received to one of the Secretaries
of State.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Expre&s;s that had been &s;ent to <HI>Paris</HI> returned with reiterated Orders
to <HI>Mon&s;ieur Le Fonde</HI> to ha&s;ten the Chancellor's Journey,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He receives Orders a &s;e|cond Time to quit</HI> France.</NOTE> and not to &s;uffer
him to remain there; who executed the Commands He had received with
great Punctuality and Importunity. The Earl of <HI>St. Albans</HI> did not vouch|&s;afe
to return any An&s;wer to his Letter, or to interpo&s;e on his Behalf, that
<MILESTONE N="10">He might re&s;t till He might &s;ecurely enter upon his Journey: Only Abbot
<HI>Mountague</HI> writ very obligingly to him, and offered all the Offices could
be in his Power to perform, and excu&s;ed the Rigour of the Court's Pro|ceedings,
as the Effect of &s;uch Rea&s;on of State, as would not permit any
Alteration whil&s;t They had that Apprehen&s;ion of the Parliament; and
therefore advi&s;ed him &startq;to comply with their Wi&s;hes, and make no longer
Stay in <HI>Roan,</HI> which would not be permitted.&endq; But the general Indi&s;po|&s;ition
of his Body, the Fatigue of his Journey, and the Brui&s;es He had re|ceived
by the Falls and Overturnings of the Coach, made him not able to ri&s;e
out of his Bed; and the Phy&s;icians, who had taken much Blood from him,
<MILESTONE N="20">exceedingly di&s;&s;uaded it. All which, how vi&s;ible &s;oever, prevailed not with
his <HI>French</HI> Conductor to le&s;&s;en his Importunity that He would go, though
it was evident He could not ea&s;ily &s;tand; of which no Doubt He gave true
and faithful Adverti&s;ement to the Court, though the Jealou&s;y of being
not thought active enough in his Tru&s;t made his Behaviour much le&s;s
civil, than is agreeable to the Cu&s;tom of that Nation.</P>
<P>HOWEVER the Chancellor,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He again re|pre&s;ents his ill State of Health to the</HI> French <HI>Court.</HI></NOTE> hardened by the Inhumanity of his Treat|ment,
writ &s;uch a Letter in <HI>Latin</HI> to <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Lionne,</HI> by who&s;e Hand
all the ungentle Orders to <HI>Mon&s;ieur Le Fonde</HI> had been tran&s;mitted, as ex|pre&s;&s;ed
the Condition He was in, and his Di&s;ability to comply with his Ma|je&s;ty's
<MILESTONE N="30">Commands until He could recover more Strength; not without Com|plaint
of the little Civility He had received in <HI>France.</HI> And He writ like|wi&s;e
to the Abbot <HI>Mountague,</HI> &startq;to u&s;e his Credit with <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Tellier,</HI>&endq;
upon who&s;e Humanity He more depended, &startq;to interpo&s;e with his <HI>Chri&s;|tian</HI>
Maje&s;ty, that He might not be pre&s;&s;ed beyond what his Health would
bear.&endq; And &s;ince at that Time He re&s;olved to make his Journey to
<HI>Avignon,</HI> that He might be out of the Dominions of <HI>France,</HI> He de&s;ired,&startq;
that He might have Liberty to re&s;t &s;ome Days at <HI>Orleans,</HI> until his Ser|vants
who were upon the Sea, and brought with them many Things
which He wanted, might come to him; and that He might afterwards,
<MILESTONE N="40">in &s;o long a Journey in the wor&s;t Sea&s;on of the Year, have Liberty to
take &s;uch Repo&s;e as his Health would require; in which He could not
affect unnece&s;&s;ary Delay, for the great Charge and Expen&s;e it mu&s;t be
accompanied with.&endq;</P>
<P>THE An&s;wer He received from <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Lionne</HI> was the renewing
the King's Commands for his &s;peedy Departure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But receives fre&s;h Orders to remove im|mediately.</NOTE> &startq;as a Thing ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary to his Affairs, and which mu&s;t not be di&s;puted.&endq; But that
which affected him the more tenderly, was the Sight of a Billet which
Abbot <HI>Mountague</HI> &s;ent to him, that He had received from <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Tel|lier,</HI>
in which He &s;aid, &startq;that He had, according to his De&s;ire, moved
<MILESTONE N="50">his <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Maje&s;ty concerning the Chancellor of <HI>England;</HI> and that his
Maje&s;ty was much di&s;plea&s;ed that He made not more Ha&s;te to comply
with what was mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for his Affairs, and that it mu&s;t be no longer
<PB N="468" REF="474">
delayed; and that if He cho&s;e to pa&s;s to <HI>Avignon,</HI> He might re&s;t one Day
in ten, which was all his Maje&s;ty would allow.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS unexpected Determination, without the lea&s;t Ceremony or Circum|&s;tance
of Remor&s;e, &s;ignified by a Per&s;on who He was well a&s;&s;ured was well
inclined to have returned a more grateful An&s;wer, in the In&s;tant &s;uppre&s;&s;ed
all Hopes of finding any Humanity in <HI>France,</HI> and rai&s;ed a Re&s;olution in
him to get out of tho&s;e Dominions with all the Expedition that was po&s;&s;i|ble:
Which his <HI>French</HI> Conductor urged with new and importunate In|&s;tance;
in&s;omuch as though there was &s;ure Information, that the Ship, in
which the Chancellor's Servants and Goods were embarked, was arrived at<MILESTONE N="10">
the Mouth of the River, and only kept by the cro&s;s Wind from coming up
to the Town; He would by no Means con&s;ent to the Delay of one Day in
Expectation of it, or that his Servants might come to him by Land, as He
had &s;ent to them to do.</P>
<P>AT this very Time arrived an Expre&s;s, a Servant of his, &s;ent by his Children,
with a particular Account of all the Tran&s;actions in Parliament, and of the
Bill of Bani&s;hment; of Nothing of which He had before heard, and upon
which the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> who looked upon him&s;elf as ill u&s;ed by that Pro|&s;ecution,
was of Opinion, &startq;that the Chancellor &s;hould make all po&s;&s;ible
Ha&s;te, and appear by the Day appointed, and undergo the Trial, in which<MILESTONE N="20">
He knew his Innocence would ju&s;tify him.&endq; This Advice, with a little
Indignation at the Di&s;courte&s;y of the Court of <HI>France,</HI> diverted him from
any farther Thought of <HI>Avignon.</HI> And though He did not imagine that
his Strength would be &s;ufficient to perform the Journey by the Day a&s;&s;igned
(for the Gout had already &s;eized upon Both his Feet), nor did the Argu|ments
for his Return &s;atisfy him; and the Breach of all the Promi&s;es which
had been made was no Sign that They meant &s;peedily to bring him to Trial,
towards which They had not yet made any Preparation: Yet He re&s;olved to
make all po&s;&s;ible Ha&s;te to <HI>Calais,</HI> that it might be in his Power to proceed
according to &s;uch Directions as He might rea&s;onably expect to receive there<MILESTONE N="30">
from his Friends from <HI>England,</HI> and from whence He might quickly re|move
into the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dominions; though the Climate of <HI>Flanders,</HI> well
known to him, terrified him in Re&s;pect of the Sea&s;on and his approaching
Gout. And with this Re&s;olution He di&s;patched the Expre&s;s again for <HI>Eng|land;</HI>
and left Order with a Merchant at <HI>Roan,</HI> &startq;to receive his Goods when
the Ship &s;hould arrive, and detain both them and his Servants till He &s;hould
&s;end farther Orders from <HI>Calais:</HI>&endq; And at the &s;ame Time He writ to a
Friend in <HI>Flanders,</HI> to &s;peak to the Marquis of <HI>Carracena,</HI> with whom He
had formerly held a fair Corre&s;pondence, &startq;to &s;end him a Pa&s;s to go through
that Country to what Place He &s;hould think fit.&endq; And having thus pro|vided<MILESTONE N="40">
for his Journey, He departed from <HI>Roan,</HI> after He had remained
there about twenty Days.</P>
<P>IN how ill a Condition of Health &s;oever He was to travel,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He returns to</HI> Calais.</NOTE> when the Days
were at &s;horte&s;t, He re&s;olved to make no Stay till He &s;hould reach <HI>Calais,</HI>
to the End, that if He met with no Advice there to the Contrary, He might
be at <HI>London</HI> by the Day limited by the Proclamation, which was the fir&s;t
of <HI>February</HI> that Style: And it was the la&s;t of <HI>January</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Style
when He arrived at <HI>Calais,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Where He is confined to his Bed by a dan|gerous Illne&s;s.</NOTE> &s;o broken with the Fatigue of the Journey and

in a Fever, and thought it nece&s;&s;ary to open a Vein, which They pre&s;ently
did. But the Pains in all his Limbs &s;o increa&s;ed, that He was not able to
turn in his Bed; nor for many Nights clo&s;ed his Eyes. Many Letters He
<PB N="469" REF="475">
found there from <HI>England,</HI> but was not in a Condition to read them, nor
in Truth could &s;peak and di&s;cour&s;e with any Body. <HI>Mon&s;ieur Le Fonde,</HI> out
of pure Compa&s;&s;ion, &s;uffered him to remain &s;ome Days without his Vexa|tion,
until He received fre&s;h Orders from <HI>Paris,</HI> &startq;that the Chancellor
might not, in what Ca&s;e &s;oever, be &s;uffered to remain in <HI>Calais:</HI>&endq; And
then He renewed his Importunity,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Yet He is re|quired to re|tire out of the</HI> French <HI>Ter|ritories.</HI></NOTE> &startq;that He would the next Day leave the
Town, and either by Sea or Land, if He thought it not fit to pa&s;s for
<HI>England,</HI> put him&s;elf into the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dominions, which He might do in
few Hours.&endq;</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10">HE was &s;o confounded with the Barbarity, that He had no Mind to give
him any An&s;wer; nor could He &s;uddenly find Words, their Conver&s;ation
being in <HI>Latin,</HI> to expre&s;s the Pa&s;&s;ion He was in. At la&s;t He told him,
&startq;that He mu&s;t bring Orders from God Almighty as well as from the King,
before He could obey: That He &s;aw the Condition He was in, and con|ferred
every Day with his Phy&s;icians, by which He could not but know,
that He could neither help him&s;elf, nor endure the being carried out of
that Chamber, if the Hou&s;e were in a Flame; and therefore that He did
not u&s;e him like a Gentleman, in adding his unrea&s;onable Importunities
to the Vexation He &s;uffered by Pain and Sickne&s;s. That He might be
<MILESTONE N="20">very confident, his Treatment had not been &s;o obliging to make him &s;tay
one Hour in <HI>France,</HI> after He &s;hould be able to go out of it: But He
would not willingly endanger him&s;elf by Sea to fall into the Hands of his
Enemies. That He knew&endq; (for He had &s;hewed him his Letter) &startq;that
He had written into <HI>Flanders</HI> for a Pa&s;s, which was not yet come: As
&s;oon as it did, if He could procure a Litter and endure the Motion of it,
He would remove to <HI>St. Omers</HI> or <HI>Newport,</HI> which were the neare&s;t Places
under the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Government.&endq;</P>
<P>TO all which He replied with no Exce&s;s of Courte&s;y, &startq;that He mu&s;t
and would obey his Orders as He had done; and that He had no Power
<MILESTONE N="30">to judge of his Di&s;ability to remove, or of the Pain He underwent.&endq; And
there is no Doubt the Gentleman, who was well bred and in his Nature
very civil, was not plea&s;ed with his Province, and much troubled that He
could not avoid the Delivery of the Orders He received: And the Con|juncture
of their Affairs was &s;uch with Reference to the De&s;igns then on
Foot, that every Po&s;t brought reiterated Commands for the Chancellor's Re|move;
which grew every Day more impo&s;&s;ible, by the Acce&s;s of new Pain
to the Weakne&s;s He was in for Want of Sleep without any Kind of
Su&s;tenance.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING which, within few Days after the la&s;t Encounter,
<MILESTONE N="40">upon fre&s;h Letters from <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Lionne,</HI> the Gentleman came again to
him, told him what Orders He had received, and again propo&s;ed, &startq;that He
would either make U&s;e of a Boat to <HI>Newport</HI> or <HI>O&s;tend,</HI> or a <HI>Brancard</HI> to
<HI>St. Omers;</HI> either of which He would cau&s;e to be provided again&s;t the
next Morning, for the King's Service was exceedingly concerned in the
Expedition.&endq; And when He &s;aw the other was not moved with what He
&s;aid, nor gave him any An&s;wer, He told him plainly, &startq;that the King would
be obeyed in his own Dominions; and if He would not choo&s;e to do that
which the King had required, He mu&s;t go to the Governour, who had
Authority and Power to compel him, which He dur&s;t not but do.&endq; Upon
<MILESTONE N="50">which, with the Supply of Spirit that Choler admini&s;tered to him, He told
him, &startq;that though the King was a very great and powerful Prince, He was
not yet &s;o omnipotent, as to make a dying Man &s;trong enough to under|take
a Journey. That He was at the King's Mercy, and would endure
<PB N="470" REF="476">
what He &s;hould exact from him as well as He was able: It was in his
Maje&s;ty's Power to &s;end him a Pri&s;oner into <HI>England,</HI> or to cau&s;e him to
be carried dead or alive into the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Territories; but He would not
be <HI>Felo de &s;e,</HI> by willingly attempting to do what He and all who &s;aw
him knew was not po&s;&s;ible for him to perform.&endq; And in this Pa&s;&s;ion He
added &s;ome Words of Reproach to <HI>Le Fonde,</HI> which were more due to <HI>Mon|&s;ieur
De Lionne,</HI> who in Truth had not behaved him&s;elf with any Civility:
Whereupon He withdrew in the like Di&s;order, and for &s;ome Days forbore
&s;o much as to &s;ee him, in which He had never before failed a Day.</P>
<P>AND the Chancellor, who really did believe that &s;ome Force and Violence<MILESTONE N="10">
would be u&s;ed towards him, pre&s;ently &s;ent to de&s;ire the chief Magi&s;trates of
the Town and the Lieutenant Governour to come to him; and then told
them all the Treatment He had received from <HI>Mon&s;ieur Le Fonde,</HI> and ap|pealed
to them, &startq;whether They thought him in a Condition to perform any
Journey.&endq; And the Phy&s;icians being likewi&s;e pre&s;ent, He required them
to &s;ign &s;uch a Certificate and Te&s;timony of his Sickne&s;s as They thought
their Duty, which They readily performed; very fully declaring under their
Hands, &startq;that He could not be removed out of the Chamber in which He
lay, without manife&s;t Danger of his Life.&endq; And the Lieutenant Governour
and the Pre&s;ident of Ju&s;tice &s;eemed much &s;candalized at what had been &s;o<MILESTONE N="20">
much pre&s;&s;ed, of which They had taken Notice many Days: And the one
of them wrote to the Count of <HI>Charrou,</HI> Governour of the Town and then
at Court, and the other to <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Lionne,</HI> what They thought fit;
and the Certificate of the Phy&s;icians was enclo&s;ed to the Abbot <HI>Mountague,</HI>
with a full Relation of what had pa&s;&s;ed. And it was never doubted, but
that <HI>Mon&s;ieur Le Fonde</HI> him&s;elf made a very faithful Relation of the Impo&s;|&s;ibility
that the Chancellor could comply with what was required, in the
State of Sickne&s;s and Pain that He was in at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>BY this Time the <HI>French</HI> Court di&s;covered,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> French <HI>Court &s;uddenly alters its Be|haviour.</HI></NOTE> that They were prevented of
entering into that &s;trait Alliance They hoped with <HI>England</HI> (and for ob|taining<MILESTONE N="30">
whereof They had gratified the proud and malicious Humours of
the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> and Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> in the Treatment of the
Chancellor), by the <HI>Triple League,</HI> which They had u&s;ed all tho&s;e Com|pliances
to prevent: So that by the next Po&s;t after the Receipt of the Cer|tificate
from the Phy&s;icians, <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Lionne</HI> writ a very civil Letter to
the Chancellor, in which He prote&s;ted, &startq;that He had the &s;ame Re&s;pect
for him which He had always profe&s;&s;ed to have in his greate&s;t Fortune,
and that it was never in the Purpo&s;e of his <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Maje&s;ty to endanger
his Health by making any Journey that He could not well endure;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He has Leave to re&s;ide in</HI> France.</NOTE> and
therefore that it was left entirely to him&s;elf to remove from <HI>Calais</HI> when<MILESTONE N="40">
He thought fit, and to go to what Place He would.&endq; And <HI>Mon&s;ieur Le
Fonde</HI> came now again to vi&s;it him with another Countenance, by which a
Man could not but di&s;cern, that He was much better plea&s;ed with the Com|mi&s;&s;ion
He had received la&s;t than with the former; and told him, &startq;that
He was now to receive no Orders but from him&s;elf, which He would
gladly obey.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS gave him &s;ome little Ea&s;e in the Agony He was in, for his Pains
increa&s;ed to an intolerable Degree, in&s;omuch that He could not ri&s;e out of
his Bed in &s;ix Weeks. And it was the more welcome to him, becau&s;e at
the &s;ame Time He received an Account from his Friend in <HI>Flanders,</HI> &startq;that<MILESTONE N="50">
the Marquis of <HI>Ca&s;telle Roderigo,</HI> with as much Regret as a civil Man
could expre&s;s, prote&s;ted, <HI>that the Fear He had of offending the Parliament
at that Time would not permit him to grant a Pa&s;s: But if He would come
<PB N="471" REF="477">
to</HI> Newport, <HI>He &s;hould find the Governour there well prepared and di&s;po&s;ed
to &s;hew him all po&s;&s;ible Re&s;pect, and to accommodate him in his Pa&s;&s;age
throughout the Country, where it would not be convenient for him to make
any Stay; and that He looked upon it as a great Misfortune to him&s;elf,
that He might not wait upon him in his Pa&s;&s;age.</HI>&endq; This made it ea&s;y for
him to di&s;cern, that his Enemies would not give him any Re&s;t in any Place
where their Malice could reach him: And &s;ince They were &s;o terrible that
the Marquis of <HI>Ca&s;telle Roderigo</HI> dur&s;t not grant him a Pa&s;s, He thought it
would be no hard Matter for them to cau&s;e &s;ome Affront to be put on him
<MILESTONE N="10">when He &s;hould be without any Pa&s;s; though He had not the lea&s;t Su&s;picion
of the Marquis his failing in Point of Honour or Courte&s;y.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame Time He received Advice from his Friends in <HI>England,</HI>&startq;
that the Storm from <HI>France</HI> was over, and that He might be permitted to
&s;tay in any Part thereof; and for the pre&s;ent They wi&s;hed that He would
repair to the Waters of <HI>Bourbon</HI> for his Health, and then choo&s;e &s;uch
a Place to re&s;ide in, as upon Inquiry He &s;hould judge mo&s;t proper.&endq; But
He was not yet &s;o far reconciled to that Court, though He liked the Climate
well, as to depend upon its Protection: And therefore He re&s;umed his
former Purpo&s;e of going to <HI>Avignon,</HI> and, if He could recover Strength for
<MILESTONE N="20">the Journey before the Sea&s;on &s;hould be expired for drinking the Waters of
<HI>Bourbon,</HI> to pa&s;s that Way. And to that Purpo&s;e He &s;ent to the Court
&startq;for a Pa&s;s to <HI>Avignon,</HI> with Liberty to &s;tay &s;ome Days at <HI>Roan,</HI>&endq; where
his Goods and his Monies were (for his Servants had come from thence to
him to <HI>Calais</HI>), &startq;and to u&s;e the Waters of <HI>Bourbon</HI> in his Way:&endq; All which
was readily granted.</P>
<P>IT was the third of <HI>April,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He returns to</HI> Roan.</NOTE> before He recovered Strength enough to endure
a Coach: And then, having bought a large and ea&s;y Coach of the Pre&s;ident
of <HI>Calais,</HI> He hired Hor&s;es there. And &s;o He begun his Journey for <HI>Roan,</HI>
being &s;till &s;o lame and weak that He could not go without being &s;upported:
<MILESTONE N="30">And the fir&s;t Day had a very ill Omen by the Negligence of the Coach|man,
who pa&s;&s;ing upon the Sands between <HI>Calais</HI> and <HI>Boulogne,</HI> when the
Sea was flowing, drove &s;o unadvi&s;edly (which He might have avoided, as
the Hor&s;emen and another Coach did), that the Sea came over the Boot of
the Coach, to the Middle of all tho&s;e who fate in it; and a Minute's Pau&s;e
more had inevitably overthrown the Coach (the Weight whereof only then
prevented it), and They had been all covered with the Sea. And two Days
after, by the Change of the Coachman for a wor&s;e, He was overthrown in
a Place almo&s;t as bad, into a deep and dirty Water, from whence He was
with Difficulty and &s;ome Hurt drawn out. Both which wonderful Deli|verances
<MILESTONE N="40">were comfortable In&s;tances that God would protect him, of which
He had within few Days a fre&s;h and extraordinary Evidence.</P>
<P>WHEN He came to <HI>Roan,</HI> He received all tho&s;e Orders He had de&s;ired
from the Court. And a Letter from Abbot <HI>Mountague</HI> a&s;&s;ured him, &startq;that
He need no more apprehend any Di&s;commodity from Orders of the Court,
but might be confident of the Contrary, and of all Re&s;pect that could be
&s;hewed him from thence: That He might &s;tay at <HI>Roan</HI> as long as his In|di&s;po&s;ition
required; and when He had made U&s;e of the Waters of <HI>Bourbon,</HI>
He might retire to any Place He would choo&s;e to re&s;ide in.&endq; <HI>Mon&s;ieur
Le Fonde</HI> had Orders, &startq;after He had accompanied the Chancellor two
<MILESTONE N="50">or three Days Journey towards <HI>Bourbon,</HI> except He de&s;ired his Company
longer, to return to the Court.&endq; Only <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Lionne</HI> de&s;ired, &startq;that
He would not in his Journey come nearer <HI>Paris</HI> than the direct Way re|quired
him to do, becau&s;e the Emperour's Agent at <HI>London,</HI> the Baron of
<PB N="472" REF="478">
<HI>I&s;ola,</HI> had confidently averred, <HI>that the King had one Day gone</HI> incognito
<HI>from the</HI> Bois de Vincennes <HI>to meet the Chancellor, and had a long private
Conference with him.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>WHEN He had &s;tayed as long at <HI>Roan</HI> as was nece&s;&s;ary for the taking a
little Phy&s;ick and recovering a little Strength,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>From whence He begins his Journey to</HI> Avignon.</NOTE> the Sea&s;on required his making
Ha&s;te to <HI>Bourbon:</HI> And &s;o on the twenty third of <HI>April</HI> He began his
Journey from thence; and that He might comply with the Directions of
<HI>Monfieur De Lionne,</HI> He cho&s;e to go by the Way of <HI>Eureux,</HI> and to lodge
there that Night. And becau&s;e He was unable to go up a Pair of Stairs,
He &s;ent a Servant before, as He had always done, to choo&s;e an Inn where<MILESTONE N="10">
there was &s;ome Ground-Lodging, which often was attended with Di&s;com|modity
enough, and now (be&s;ides being forced to go through the City
into the Suburbs) was like to co&s;t him very dear.</P>
<P>THERE happened to be at that Time quartered there a Foot-Company of
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Seamen,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He is greatly abu&s;ed by &s;ome</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>at</HI> Eureux.</NOTE> who had been rai&s;ed and were entertained to &s;erve the
<HI>French</HI> in attending upon their Artillery, &s;ome of them being Gunners;
and none of them had the Language, but were attended by a <HI>Dutch</HI> Con|ductor,
who &s;pake ill <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> for their Interpreter. Their Behaviour there
was &s;o rude and barbarous, in being always drunk, and quarrelling and
fighting with the Town&s;men who would not give them any Thing They<MILESTONE N="20">
demanded, that the City had &s;ent to the Court their Complaints, and ex|pected
Orders that Night for their Remove. They quickly heard of the
Chancellor's being come to the Town; and calling their Company toge|ther
declared, &startq;that there were many Months Pay due to them in <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
and that They would make him pay it before He got out of the
Town.&endq;</P>
<P>HE was &s;carce gotten into his ill Ground-Lodging, when many of them
flocked about the Hou&s;e: Upon which the Gates of the Inn were &s;hut, They
making a great Noi&s;e, and &s;wearing They would &s;peak with the Chan|cellor;
and, being about the Number of fifty, They threatened to break<MILESTONE N="30">
open the Gate or pull down the Hou&s;e. The Mutiny was notorious to all
the Street; but They had not Courage to appear again&s;t them: The Ma|gi&s;trates
were &s;ent to; but there was a Difference between them upon the
Point of Juri&s;diction, this Uproar being in the Suburbs. In &s;hort, They
broke open the Door of the Inn: And when They were entered into the
Court, They quickly found which was the Chancellor's Chamber. And the
Door being barricadoed with &s;uch Things as were in the Room, They fir&s;t
di&s;charged their Pi&s;tols into the Window, with which They hurt &s;ome of the
Servants, and <HI>Mon&s;ieur Le Fonde,</HI> who with his Sword kept them from
entering in at the Window with great Courage, until He was &s;hot with a<MILESTONE N="40">
Brace of Bullets in the Head, with which He fell: And then another of
the Servants being hurt, They entered in at the Window, and opened the
Door for the re&s;t of their Company, which quickly filled the Chamber.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor was in his Gown, &s;itting upon the Bed, being not able
to &s;tand; upon whom They all came with their Swords drawn: And one
of them gave him a Blow with a great Broad&s;word upon the Head, which
if it had fallen upon the Edge mu&s;t have cleft his Head; but it turned in
his Hand, and &s;o &s;truck him with the Flat, with which He fell backward
on the Bed. They gave him many ill Words, called him &startq;Traitor,&endq; and
&s;wore, &startq;before He &s;hould get out of their Hands He &s;hould lay down all<MILESTONE N="50">
their Arrears of Pay.&endq; They differed among&s;t them&s;elves what They &s;hould
do with him, &s;ome crying, &startq;that They would kill him,&endq; others, &startq;that
They would carry him into <HI>England:</HI>&endq; Some had their Hands in his
<PB N="473" REF="479">
Pockets, and pillaged him of his Money and &s;ome other Things of Value;
others broke up his Trunks and plundered his Goods. When him&s;elf reco|vered
out of the Trance in which He was &s;tunned by the Blow, They took
him by the Hand who &s;pake of carrying him into <HI>England,</HI> and told him,
&startq;it was the wi&s;e&s;t Thing They could do to carry him thither, where
They would be well rewarded:&endq; Another &s;wore, &startq;that They &s;hould be
better rewarded for killing him there.&endq; And in this Confu&s;ion, the
Room being full and all &s;peaking together, the Fellow who had given him
the Blow, who&s;e Name was <HI>Howard,</HI> a very lu&s;ty &s;trong Man, took him
<MILESTONE N="10">by the Hand, and &s;wore, &startq;They &s;hould hurt one another if They killed
him there; and therefore They would take him into the Court, and di&s;|patch
him where there was more Room.&endq; And thereupon others laid
their Hands upon him and pulled him to the Ground, and then dragged
him into the Court, being in the &s;ame In&s;tant ready to run their Swords
into him together: When in the Moment their En&s;ign, and &s;ome of the
Magi&s;trates with a Guard, came into the Court, the Gate being broken;
and &s;o He was re&s;cued out of their bloody Hands, and carried back into his
Chamber.</P>
<P>HOWARD and many of the other, &s;ome whereof had been hurt with Swords
<MILESTONE N="20">as They entered at the Window, were taken and carried to Pri&s;on, and the
re&s;t di&s;per&s;ed, vowing Revenge when They &s;hould get the re&s;t of their Com|pany
together: And it cannot be expre&s;&s;ed with how much Fear the Ma|gi&s;trates,
and the poor Guard that attended them, apprehended their com|ing
upon them together again.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor him&s;elf had the Hurt before mentioned in his Head,
which was a Contu&s;ion, and already &s;wollen to a great Bigne&s;s; <HI>Mon&s;ieur
Le Fonde</HI> was &s;hot into the Head with a Brace of Bullets, and bled much,
but &s;eemed not to think him&s;elf in Danger; two of the Chancellor's Servants
were hurt with Swords, and lo&s;t much Blood: So that They all de&s;ired to
<MILESTONE N="30">be in &s;ome &s;ecure Place, that Phy&s;icians and Surgeons might vi&s;it them.
And by this Time many Per&s;ons of Quality of the Town, both Men and
Women, filled the little Chamber; bitterly inveighing again&s;t the Villany of
the Attempt, but renewing the Di&s;pute of their Juri&s;diction. And the Pro|vo&s;t,
who out of the City was the greater Officer, would provide an Ac|commodation
for them in his own Hou&s;e in the City, and appoint a Guard
for them; which the Magi&s;trates of the City would not con&s;ent to, nor He
to the Expedient propo&s;ed by them. And this Di&s;pute with Animo&s;ity and
very ill Words continued in the Chamber till Twelve of the Clock at Night,
the hurt Per&s;ons being in the mean Time without any Remedy or Ea&s;e: So
<MILESTONE N="40">that the Magi&s;trates, though They were not &s;o dangerous, were as trouble|&s;ome
as the Seamen, again&s;t whom They were not yet &s;ecure upon a &s;econd
Attempt.</P>
<P>IN the End; <HI>Mon&s;ieur Le Fonde</HI> was forced to rai&s;e his Voice louder
than was agreeable to the State He was in, to threaten to complain of them
to the King, for their Neglect before and after the Mi&s;chief was done: By
which They were much moved, and pre&s;ently &s;ent to the Governour of the
Duke of <HI>Bouillon's</HI> Ca&s;tle (which is a good and noble Hou&s;e in the Town),
&startq;that He would receive the Chancellor and <HI>Mon&s;ieur Le Fonde,</HI> with &s;uch
Servants as were nece&s;&s;ary for their Attendance;&endq; which He did with great
<MILESTONE N="50">Courte&s;y, and gave them &s;uch Accommodation as in an unfurni&s;hed Hou&s;e
could on the Sudden be expected. And &s;o Phy&s;icians and Surgeons vi&s;ited
their Wounds, and applied &s;uch pre&s;ent Remedies as were nece&s;&s;ary, till upon
&s;ome Repo&s;e They might make a better Judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="474" REF="480">
THE &s;ame Night there were Expre&s;&s;es di&s;patched to the Court to give
Adverti&s;ement of the Outrage, and to <HI>Roan</HI> to inform the Intendant in
who&s;e Province it was committed: And He the next Day with a good Guard
of Hor&s;e arrived at <HI>Eureux.</HI> After He had vi&s;ited the Chancellor, with
the ju&s;t Sen&s;e of the In&s;olence He had undergone, and of the Indignity that
the King and his Government had &s;u&s;tained; He proceeded in the Court of
Ju&s;tice to examine the whole Proceedings, and much blamed the Magi&s;trates
on all Sides for their Negligence and Remi&s;&s;ne&s;s. Upon the whole Examina|tion
there appeared no Cau&s;e to believe, that there was any formed De&s;ign
in which any others had concurred than They who appeared in the Execu|tion,<MILESTONE N="10">
who defended them&s;elves by being drunk, which did not appear in
any other Thing than in the Barbarity of the Action. Yet it was confe&s;&s;ed,
that upon their fir&s;t Arrival at <HI>Dieppe,</HI> and whil&s;t They were quartered
there, the Chancellor then pa&s;&s;ing by between <HI>Roan</HI> and <HI>Calais,</HI> They had
a Re&s;olution to have robbed or killed him, if They had not been prevented
by his getting the Gates opened, and &s;o going away before the u&s;ual Hour.</P>
<P>THE Surgeons found <HI>Mon&s;ieur Le Fonde's</HI> Wound to be more dangerous
than They had apprehended, and that at lea&s;t one of the Bullets remained &s;till
in the Wound, and doubted that it might have hurt the Scull, in which
Ca&s;e trepanning would be nece&s;&s;ary; which made him re&s;olve, though He<MILESTONE N="20">
was feveri&s;h, pre&s;ently to have a <HI>Brancard</HI> made, and to be put into it in
his Bed, and &s;o with Expedition to be carried to <HI>Paris,</HI> where He was &s;ure
to find better Operators, be&s;ides the Benefit and Convenience of his own
Hou&s;e and Family. And &s;o the third Day after his Mi&s;adventure, and after
He had given his Te&s;timony to the Intendant, He was in that Manner, and
attended by a Surgeon, conveyed to <HI>Paris;</HI> and, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God,
recovered without the Remedy that had been propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor, after He had bled once or twice, found him&s;elf only in
Pain with the Blow, without any other Symptoms which frequently attend
great Contu&s;ions; and therefore He po&s;itively rejected the Propo&s;ition of<MILESTONE N="30">
trepanning, which had been likewi&s;e earne&s;tly urged by the Surgeons: And
upon Application of &s;uch Pla&s;ters and Ointments as were pre&s;cribed, He
found both the Pain and Swelling le&s;&s;en by Degrees, though the Memory of
the Blow la&s;ted long; &s;o that He thought him&s;elf fit enough for his Journey,
and was impatient to be out of that unlucky Town; and his Servants,
having only Fle&s;h-Hurts, could endure the Coach as well as He. The In|tendant,
who knew his De&s;ire, and was willing to defer his Judgment till
He was gone from thence, was very well content that He &s;hould proceed in
his Journey,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He removes from thence to</HI> Bourbon.</NOTE> and &s;ent his Sons with his own Troop to convoy him two or
three Leagues out of the Town; and appointed the Provo&s;t with his Troop<MILESTONE N="40">
of Hor&s;e to attend him to his Lodging that Night, and farther if He de|&s;ired
it. And the next Day He condemned <HI>Howard</HI> and two others, an
<HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> a <HI>Scotchman,</HI> and an <HI>Iri&s;hman</HI> (for the Company con&s;i&s;ted of
the three Nations), to be broken upon the Wheel; which was executed ac|cordingly.
And &s;hortly after his Arrival at <HI>Bourbon, Mon&s;ieur De Lioune</HI>
writ a very civil Letter to the Chancellor, &startq;of the Trouble the King &s;u&s;|tained
for the Affront and Danger He had undergone; and that his Ma|je&s;ty
was very ill &s;atisfied, that &s;o few as three had been &s;acrificed to
Ju&s;tice for &s;o barbarous a Crime.&endq;</P>
<P>WHEN He had &s;tayed as long at <HI>Bourbon</HI> in the U&s;e of the Waters,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And from thence to</HI> A|vignon.</NOTE> as the<MILESTONE N="50">
Phy&s;icians pre&s;cribed (in which Time He found a good Recovery of his
Strength, &s;ave that the Weakne&s;s of his Feet &s;till continued in an unea&s;y

<PB N="475" REF="481">
the <HI>French</HI> of Quality, Men and Women, who came thither for the &s;ame
Remedies, and with whom the Town then abounded; He pro&s;ecuted his
Journey to <HI>Avignon:</HI> And having &s;tayed a Week at <HI>Lyons,</HI> without any new
ill Accident He arrived about the Middle of <HI>June</HI> there, by the plea&s;ant
Pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Rhone.</HI></P>
<P>THOUGH He de&s;ired to make his Journey as privately as He could, and
had no more Servants in his Train than was nece&s;&s;ary to the State of Health
He was in; yet He was known in mo&s;t Places by the Pre&s;ence of <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI>
or by &s;ome other Accident.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His good Re|ception there.</NOTE> And &s;ome Friends at <HI>Paris</HI> had given &s;uch Ad|verti&s;ement
<MILESTONE N="10">to <HI>Avignon,</HI> that when He arrived there, He had no &s;ooner en|tered
into a private Lodging, which He procured the next Day, but the
Vice-Legate came to vi&s;it him in great State and with much Civility, offering
all the Commodities of that Place if He would re&s;ide there. The Archbi|&s;hop,
a very reverend and learned Prelate, a <HI>Genoe&s;e,</HI> as the Vice-Legate
likewi&s;e was, performed the &s;ame Ceremony to him; and afterwards the
Con&s;uls and Magi&s;trates of the City in a Body (who made a Speech to him
in <HI>Latin,</HI> as all the re&s;t treated him in that Language), and all the principal
Officers of the Court: So that He could not receive more Civility and Re&s;|pect
in any Place; which, together with the Cheapne&s;s and Convenience of
<MILESTONE N="20">Living, and the Plea&s;antne&s;s of the Country about it, might have inclined
him to re&s;ide there. Yet the ill Savour of the Streets by the Multitude of
Dyers and of the Silk-Manufactures, and the wor&s;e Smell of the <HI>Jews,</HI> made
him doubt that it could be no plea&s;ant Place to make an Abode in during the
Heat of Summer: And therefore receiving new Confirmation by Letters from
<HI>Paris,</HI> &startq;that He was entirely at Liberty to re&s;ide where He would in <HI>France,</HI>&endq;
He re&s;olved to take a View of &s;ome Places before He would conclude where
to fix; and the Fame of <HI>Montpelier,</HI> that was within two little Days Jour|ney,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He goes to</HI> Montpelier.</NOTE>
invited him thither. And &s;o after a Week's Stay at <HI>Avignon,</HI> and after
having returned all the Vi&s;its He had received, He went from thence, and
<MILESTONE N="30">came to <HI>Montpelier</HI> in the Beginning of <HI>July.</HI></P>
<P>IT was his very good Fortune,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Where He re|ceives great Civilities from the Lady</HI> Mor|daunt.</NOTE> that an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lady of eminent Virtue
and Merit, the Lady Vi&s;counte&s;s <HI>Mordaunt,</HI> who had in the Beginning of
the Winter before, in as great Weakne&s;s of Body as Nature can &s;ub&s;i&s;t with,
tran&s;ported her&s;elf thither, remained &s;till at <HI>Montpelier;</HI> where She had mi|raculou&s;ly,
by the Benefit of that Air, recovered a comfortable Degree of
Health: And the News of her being &s;till there was a great Motive to his
Journey from <HI>Avignon</HI> thither. The Chancellor had no Mind to be taken
Notice of; but &s;ome Relations which that Lady made to his Advantage,
and the great E&s;teem that City had of her, made his Reception there more
<MILESTONE N="40">formal and ceremonious than He de&s;ired.</P>
<P>THE Marquis <HI>De Ca&s;tro,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Re&s;pect paid to him there.</NOTE> Governour of the City and Ca&s;tle, vi&s;ited him
and welcomed him to the Town, though He had not &s;o much as a Pa&s;s to
come thither. The <HI>Premier</HI> Pre&s;ident, and all the other Courts, and the
Con&s;ul and other Magi&s;trates of the City, vi&s;ited him in their &s;everal Bodies,
and entertained him in <HI>Latin.</HI> It is true, that &s;ome Days after, the In|tendant
of the Province (who was not then in the Town) came thither; and
He had received Orders from the Court, as &s;oon as it was known that
the Chancellor was in <HI>Montpelier,</HI> &startq;that He &s;hould be looked upon and
treated as a Per&s;on of whom the <HI>Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian</HI> King had a good E&s;teem:&endq;
<MILESTONE N="50">And &s;o, as &s;oon as He came to the Town, He vi&s;ited him with much
Ceremony, and told him, &startq;that He had received a particular Command
from the King to do him all the Services He could in that City, and in
the Province of <HI>Languedoc.</HI>&endq; And it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that during his
<PB N="476" REF="482">
Re&s;idence in <HI>Montpelier,</HI> which was not above one or two Months le&s;s than
three Years, He did receive as much Civility and formal Courte&s;y from all
Per&s;ons of all Conditions in that Place, or who occa&s;ionally re&s;orted thither,
as could have been performed towards him, if He had been &s;ent thither as
a publick Per&s;on. And when the Duke of <HI>Vernueil</HI> (who was Governour
of the Province, and u&s;ed to convene the States thither every Year) came to
<HI>Montpelier,</HI> as He did three Times in tho&s;e three Years, He always vi&s;ited
the Chancellor, and &s;hewed a very great Re&s;pect to him: Which was as great
a Countenance as He could receive.</P>
<P>YET He did always acknowledge,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Which He im|putes to the Friend&s;hip of Lady</HI> Mor|daunt.</NOTE> that He owed all the Civilities which<MILESTONE N="10">
He received at his fir&s;t coming thither, and which were upon the Matter
the fir&s;t Civilities He had received in <HI>France,</HI> purely to the Friend&s;hip of the
Lady <HI>Mordaunt,</HI> and to the great Credit She had there: And for which,
and the Con&s;olation He received from her during the Time of her Stay
there, He had ever a great Re&s;pect for her and her Hu&s;band; who, coming
likewi&s;e thither, when He received Information from <HI>England</HI> of a De&s;ign
to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him by &s;ome <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> manife&s;ted a noble Affection for him, and
&s;tayed &s;ome Months longer than He intended to have done, that He might
&s;ee the I&s;&s;ue of that De&s;ign. Of which He had a ju&s;t Sen&s;e, and tran&s;|mitted
the Information of it to his Children, to the End that They and<MILESTONE N="20">
his Friends might, upon all Opportunities, acknowledge it to them Both.</P>
<P>AND in Truth the great Re&s;pect the Place had for him was notorious,
when any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> came thither, and forbore to pay any Re&s;pect to the
Chancellor; as only one Gentleman did, Sir <HI>Richard Temple,</HI> who publickly
declared &startq;that He would not vi&s;it him,&endq; and di&s;&s;uaded others from doing
it as a Matter the Parliament would puni&s;h them for, and &s;hewed much
Vanity and In&s;olence in his Di&s;cour&s;es concerning him: But He found &s;o
little Countenance from any Per&s;on of Condition, though He called him&s;elf
&startq;the <HI>Premier</HI> Pre&s;ident of the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI>&endq; and &s;uch a general
Aver&s;ion towards him; that as They who came with him, and his other<MILESTONE N="30">
Friends, de&s;erted him and paid their Civilities to the Chancellor, &s;o him&s;elf
grew &s;o ridiculous, that He left the Town &s;ooner than He intended, and
left the Reputation behind him of a very vain, humorous and &s;ordid Per&s;on.</P>
<P>AND having thus accompanied the Chancellor through all his ill Treat|ments
and Mi&s;adventures to <HI>Montpelier,</HI> where He re&s;olved to &s;tay, it will
be to no Purpo&s;e farther to continue this Relation; otherwi&s;e than as him|&s;elf
afterwards communicated his private Thoughts and Reflections to his
Friends.</P>
<P>WHEN He found him&s;elf at this Ea&s;e, and with tho&s;e convenient Ac|commodations,
that He might rea&s;onably believe He &s;hould be no more<MILESTONE N="40">
expo&s;ed to the Troubles and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es which He had pa&s;&s;ed through; He
began to think of compo&s;ing his Mind to his Fortune, and of regulating
and governing his own Thoughts and Affections towards &s;uch a Tranquillity,
as the Sickne&s;s of Mind and Body, and the continued &s;harp Fatigue in the
&s;ix or &s;even precedent Months, had not &s;uffered to enter into any formed
Deliberation. And it plea&s;ed God in a &s;hort Time, after &s;ome Recollections,
and upon his entire Confidence in him, to re&s;tore him to that Serenity of
Mind, and Re&s;ignation of him&s;elf to the Di&s;po&s;al and good Plea&s;ure of God,
that They who conver&s;ed mo&s;t with him could not di&s;cover the lea&s;t Murmur
or Impatience in him, or any Unevenne&s;s in his Conver&s;ations. He re&s;olved<MILESTONE N="50">
to improve his Under&s;tanding of the <HI>French</HI> Language, not towards &s;peaking
it, the Defect of which He found many Conveniences in, but for the reading
any Books; and to learn the <HI>Italian:</HI> Towards Both which He made a com|petent
<PB N="477" REF="483">
Progre&s;s, and had Opportunity to buy or borrow any good Books He
de&s;ired to peru&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT in the fir&s;t Place He thought He was indebted to his own Reputa|tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He writes a Vindication of him&s;elf.</NOTE>
and obliged for the Information of his Children and other Friends, to
vindicate him&s;elf from tho&s;e A&s;per&s;ions and Reproaches which the Malice of
his Enemies had ca&s;t upon him in the Parliament; which, though never re|duced
into any formal or legal Charge, nor offered to be proved by any one
Witne&s;s, were yet maliciou&s;ly &s;cattered abroad and divulged to take away
his Credit. And the Performance of this Work, that was &s;o nece&s;&s;arily
<MILESTONE N="10">incumbent to him, was the more difficult, by his con&s;tant and uninterrupted
Fidelity and Zeal for the King's Service, and his Re&s;olution to &s;ay Nothing
on his own Behalf and for his own Vindication, that might in the lea&s;t
Degree reflect upon his Maje&s;ty; which Con&s;ideration had before kept him
from charging tho&s;e who per&s;ecuted him, with &s;uch indirect and naughty
Proceedings as might have put an End to their Power. Nor did He think
fit in that Conjuncture, when his Maje&s;ty had not yet met with that Com|pliance
and Submi&s;&s;ion from the Parliament &s;ince the Chancellor's Remove,
as had been promi&s;ed to him as the Effect of that Coun&s;el, to publi&s;h,
that his coming away (which was the greate&s;t Blot upon his Reputation)
<MILESTONE N="20">was with the King's Privity, and at lea&s;t with his Approbation. However
He was re&s;olved to commit into the Cu&s;tody of his Children, who He knew
could never commit a Fault again&s;t his Maje&s;ty, &s;uch a plain, particular De|fence
of his Innocence upon every one of the Reproaches He had been charged
with, that them&s;elves might infallibly know his Uprightne&s;s and Integrity in
all his Mini&s;try, which They ob&s;erved and knew too much of to &s;u&s;pect;
and might likewi&s;e manife&s;tly convince other Men, who were willing to be
undeceived: But the Manner of doing it, in Re&s;pect of the former Con&s;i|deration,
He left to their Di&s;cretion. And having prepared this, and cau&s;ed
it to be fairly tran&s;cribed, before the Lord and Lady <HI>Mordaunt</HI> returned for
<MILESTONE N="30"><HI>England;</HI> He committed it to their Care, who delivered it &s;afely to the
Hands of his Sons.</P>
<P>THEY were them&s;elves upon that Di&s;advantage under the Reproach of
their Relation, that the elde&s;t of them was removed from his Attendance
upon the Queen for many Months, without the Allegation of any Crime;
and the other was retained only by the Goodne&s;s of the King, again&s;t the
greate&s;t Importunity that could be applied: And therefore it concerned them
to be very wary in giving any Offence, of which their Adver&s;aries might
take any Advantage. Be&s;ides, They ob&s;erved that They, who&s;e Credit and
Intere&s;t had done all the Mi&s;chief to their Father, were now fallen out
<MILESTONE N="40">among&s;t them&s;elves with equal Animo&s;ity, and had all carried them&s;elves &s;o
ill with Reference to the Publick, and &s;o loo&s;ely and licentiou&s;ly in Order
to a good Name, that their being Enemies brought little Prejudice to any
Man's Reputation; and many of tho&s;e, who had been made In&s;truments to
deprave the Chancellor, were not &s;crupulous in declaring how They had
been cozened, and how unju&s;tly He had been traduced and accu&s;ed: So that
They made no other U&s;e of the An&s;wer and Vindication They had received,
than to be thereby enabled to make a perfect Relation of &s;ome particular
Matters of Fact which were variou&s;ly reported, and could not be under&s;tood
by any but tho&s;e who had been conver&s;ant in the Tran&s;actions.</P>
<MILESTONE N="50">
<P>IT will be therefore nece&s;&s;ary in this Place, &s;ince there hath been before &s;o
methodical an Account of all that the Committee brought into the Hou&s;e of
Commons again&s;t him, and never after mentioned when They had once ac|cu&s;ed
him, to in&s;ert &s;uch a &s;hort An&s;wer and Defence to all that was alleged,
<PB N="478" REF="484">
out of that Vindication which He &s;ent from <HI>Montpelier,</HI> that Nothing may
remain in the po&s;&s;ible Thoughts of any worthy and uncorrupted Man that
may reflect upon his Sincerity, or leave any Taint upon his Memory; the
Pre&s;ervation of which from being &s;ullied by the Misfortunes which befell him,
is the only End of this Di&s;cour&s;e, never to be communicated, or peru&s;ed
by any but his neare&s;t Relations; who, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, can never
but retain that Affection and Duty to the Crown and for the Royal Family,
that by the Laws of God and Man is due to it and them, and without
which They can never expect God's Ble&s;&s;ing in this or the World to come.
And in this I &s;hall ob&s;erve the Order I u&s;ed before in the Mention of the<MILESTONE N="10">
&s;everal Allegations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His An&s;wer to the &s;everal Articles of the Charge again&s;t him.</NOTE> omitting upon any Particular the Repetition of what

him beyond the Seas and in his Service, and in which the indefatigable Pains
He took was notorious to many Nations; and after He had the Honour and
Happine&s;s to return again with his Maje&s;ty into <HI>England,</HI> and to receive
from him &s;o many eminent Marks of his Favour, and to &s;erve him near eight
Years after his Return in the Place of the greate&s;t Tru&s;t, without ever having<MILESTONE N="30">

ever made the lea&s;t Complaint again&s;t him, or had any Thought that the
Mi&s;carriages (for Mi&s;carriages were enough &s;poken of) had proceeded from
him, or from any Advice of his: He &s;aid, that as after all this He could not
but be exceedingly &s;urpri&s;ed to find him&s;elf on a Sudden, when He had not
the lea&s;t Imagination of it, bereft of the King's Favour, and fallen &s;o far
from his Kindne&s;s, even within three or four Days after his Maje&s;ty had
vouch&s;afed to condole with him in his Hou&s;e for the Death of his Wife, that<MILESTONE N="40">
He re&s;olved to take the Great Seal from him; &s;o it was no &s;mall Comfort to
him to &s;ee and know, that very few Men of Honour and Reputation ap|proved
or liked what was done; but that the &s;ame was contrived, pur&s;ued,
and brought to pa&s;s by Men and Women of no Credit in the Nation; by
Men, who had never &s;erved his Maje&s;ty or his ble&s;&s;ed Father eminently or
u&s;efully, but mo&s;t of them of Tru&s;t and Credit under <HI>Cromwell,</HI> or never
of Credit to do the King the lea&s;t Service; and who were only angry with
him for not being plea&s;ed with their vicious and debauched Lives, or for op|po&s;ing
and di&s;&s;uading their loo&s;e and unrea&s;onable Coun&s;els, which They
were every Day audaciou&s;ly admini&s;tering in Matters of the highe&s;t Moment,<MILESTONE N="50">

<P>BUT above all, He &s;aid, it was of the highe&s;t Con&s;olation to him, when
it was publickly and indu&s;triou&s;ly declared, &startq;that the King was firmly re|&s;olved
<PB N="479" REF="485">
to de&s;troy him, and would take it very well from all Men who would
contribute thereunto, by bringing in any Charge or Accu&s;ation again&s;t

tru&s;ted in Employment, Men who had mo&s;t eminently di&s;&s;erved and mali|ciou&s;ly
traduced the King, and had been to that Time looked upon as &s;uch
by his Maje&s;ty; and when all, who were believed to have any Kindne&s;s for the

Conditions and Degrees were daily &s;olicited and importuned, by Promi&s;es and
Threats, to declare them&s;elves again&s;t him, at lea&s;t if They would not be
<MILESTONE N="10">wrought over to do any Thing again&s;t their Con&s;cience, that They would
ab&s;ent them&s;elves from tho&s;e Debates: That all this Malice and Con&s;piracy,
with &s;o long Deliberation and Con&s;ultation, &s;hould not be able at la&s;t to

a one as mo&s;t Men who knew him, or who had any Tru&s;t or Employment

in his own Defence, and to mention many particular Per&s;ons in another
Manner than is u&s;ual upon Occa&s;ions of this Kind; He de&s;ired it might
be remembered and con&s;idered, that this was not written as a formal An|&s;wer
to an Impeachment, nor like to be publi&s;hed in his Life-Time, a
Judgment of Bani&s;hment being pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t him (without the lea&s;t Proof
made or offered for the making good any one Article of Trea&s;on or Mi&s;de|meanor)
by Act of Parliament; but that it was a Debt due to his Children
and Po&s;terity, that They might know (how much &s;oever They were involved
or might be in the Effects of the &s;harp Malice again&s;t him) how far He was
<MILESTONE N="30">from any Guilt of tho&s;e odious Crimes which had been &s;o odiou&s;ly laid to
his Charge.</P>
<P>AND that being his End, He might be excu&s;ed if He did &s;o far enlarge
upon all Particulars, that it might be manife&s;t unto them how far He had
been from treading in tho&s;e Paths, or having been acce&s;&s;ory to tho&s;e Coun|&s;els,
which had been the Source from whence all tho&s;e bitter Waters had
flowed, that had corrupted the Ta&s;te even almo&s;t of the whole Nation. And
in Order to that &s;o nece&s;&s;ary Di&s;cour&s;e and Vindication of his Integrity and
Honour, He could only take Notice of the printed Paper of tho&s;e Heads
for a Charge, that had been reported from the Committee to the Hou&s;e;
<MILESTONE N="40">all Corre&s;pondence and Communication being &s;o &s;trictly inhibited to all Kind

menial Servants, who only had Liberty to write unto him of his own do|me&s;tick
Affairs; and the Letters which They &s;hould write or receive were
to be fir&s;t communicated to one of the Secretaries of State.</P>
<P>TO the Charge of the fir&s;t Article it&s;elf He &s;aid; it was no great Vanity
to believe, that there was not one Per&s;on in <HI>England</HI> of any Quality to
whom He was in any Degree known, who believed him guilty of that
Charge: And that He wanted not a Cloud of Witne&s;&s;es (be&s;ides the Te&s;ti|mony
that He hoped his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf would vouch&s;afe to give him in that
<MILESTONE N="50">Particular) who, from all that They had heard him &s;ay in Council and in Con|ver&s;ation,
could vindicate him from having that odious Opinion. Having
had the Honour, by the &s;pecial Command of his late Maje&s;ty of ble&s;&s;ed Me|mory,
to attend the Prince, his now Maje&s;ty, into the Parts beyond the
<PB N="480" REF="486">
Seas, and to be always with him and in his Service tho&s;e many Years of his
Exile, and till his happy Return; He had always endeavoured to imprint
in his Maje&s;ty's Mind an Affection, E&s;teem and Reverence for the Laws of
the Land; &startq;without the trampling of which under Foot,&endq; He told him
&startq;that him&s;elf could not have been oppre&s;&s;ed; and that by the Vindication
and Support of them, He could only hope and expect Honour and Secu|rity
to the Crown.&endq; Upon that Foundation and declared Judgment (He
&s;aid) He came into the Service of the King his Father, by oppo&s;ing all ir|regular
and illegal Proceedings in Parliament; and that He had never &s;werved
from that Rule in any Advice and Coun&s;el He had given to him or to his<MILESTONE N="10">
Son.</P>
<P>FROM the Time of his Maje&s;ty's happy Return from beyond the Seas, He
had taken Nothing &s;o much to Heart, as the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the due Ad|mini&s;tration
of Ju&s;tice throughout the Kingdom according to the known
Laws of the Land, as the be&s;t Expedient He could think of for the compo|&s;ing
the general Di&s;tempers of the Nation, and uniting the Hearts of the
People in a true Obedience unto, and Reverence for, his Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on
and Government. And with what Succe&s;s He had &s;erved his Maje&s;ty in that
Province (which He had been plea&s;ed principally to commit to his Care and
Tru&s;t), He did appeal to the whole Nation; and whether the olde&s;t Man<MILESTONE N="20">
could remember, that in the be&s;t Times Ju&s;tice was ever more equally ad|mini&s;tered,
and with le&s;s Complaint and Murmur; which had been fre|quently
acknowledged from all the Parts of the Kingdom, and had been
often taken Notice of by the King him&s;elf with great Approbation, and
confe&s;&s;ed by mo&s;t of the Nobility upon &s;everal Occa&s;ions. He &s;aid, He
had often declared in Parliament the King's Affection and Reverence for
the Laws, and his Re&s;olution neither to &s;werve from them him&s;elf, nor to
&s;uffer any Body el&s;e to do &s;o: And upon the publick Occa&s;ions of &s;wearing
the Judges in any Courts, He had always enjoined them &startq;to be very &s;trict
and preci&s;e in the Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice according to Law, with all<MILESTONE N="30">
Equality, and without Re&s;pect of Per&s;ons, which the King expected from
them; and that as his Maje&s;ty re&s;olved never to interpo&s;e by Me&s;&s;age or
Letter for the Advancement or Favour of any Man's Right or Title, &s;o
He would take it very ill if any Subject (how great &s;oever) &s;hould be able
to pervert them.&endq; And He did believe there had never pa&s;&s;ed &s;o many
Years together in any Age, in which the Crown had not in the lea&s;t Degree
interpo&s;ed in any Cau&s;e or Title depending in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI> to incline
the Court to this or that Side; or in which the Crown it&s;elf hath had &s;o many
Cau&s;es judged again&s;t it in &s;everal Courts: At lea&s;t in which former Prac|tice
and U&s;age on the Behalf of the Crown hath been le&s;s followed. And<MILESTONE N="40">
Nothing is more known, than that from the Time of the King's ble&s;&s;ed Re|turn
into <HI>England,</HI> even to the Preparation of that Charge again&s;t him,
He had been reproached with Nothing &s;o much as his too much adhering
to the Law, and &s;ubjecting all Per&s;ons to it: And this Reproach had not
been ca&s;t upon him &s;o bitterly and &s;o maliciou&s;ly by any, and in Places where
They thought it might produce mo&s;t Prejudice to him, as by tho&s;e who
now contrived that Charge, and who had been always great Enemies to
the Law.</P>
<P>ALL this, and much more of the &s;ame Kind, He &s;aid, was manife&s;t to all
the World: And therefore He needed not more to labour in that Vindication.<MILESTONE N="50">
Yet He could not but ob&s;erve, that there was not in all the King's Forces,
nor was when his Forces were much greater than They were at that pre&s;ent,
one Officer recommended by him: And mo&s;t of them were &s;uch who pro|fe&s;&s;ed
<PB N="481" REF="487">
publickly a great Animo&s;ity again&s;t him, having been, by the Malice
of &s;ome Men, very unrea&s;onably per&s;uaded that the Chancellor was their
Enemy; that He de&s;ired that They might be di&s;banded, or at lea&s;t &s;o
obliged to the Rules of the Law, that They &s;hould be every Day ca&s;t into
Pri&s;on. And They had indeed found, that in &s;ome In&s;olencies which the
Soldiers had committed contrary to the Law, and &s;ome Pretences which
They made to Privileges again&s;t Arre&s;ts, and the like, He had always op|po&s;ed
their De&s;ires with more Warmth than other Men had done; as believ|ing
it might be the Cau&s;e of notable Di&s;orders, and more alienate the Affec|tion
<MILESTONE N="10">of the People from the Soldiers: So that it could not be thought pro|bable,
that He &s;hould contribute his Advice <HI>for the rai&s;ing a Standing Army,
and that the Kingdom &s;hould be governed thereby;</HI> when there were very few
Men &s;o like to be de&s;troyed by that Army as him&s;elf, who was &s;o indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly
rendered to be odious to it.</P>
<P>TO the other Part of that fir&s;t Article, <HI>that He did advi&s;e the King to di&s;|&s;olve
the pre&s;ent Parliament, and to lay a&s;ide all Thoughts of Parliaments for
the future, &amp;c.</HI> which it was &s;aid two Privy Coun&s;ellors were ready to prove;
He made a Relation of all that had pa&s;&s;ed in that Con&s;ternation when the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet came into the River as far as <HI>Chatham,</HI> and when the Debate
<MILESTONE N="20">was in Council upon the reconvening the Parliament in <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> when it
&s;tood prorogued till <HI>October,</HI> which the Chancellor affirmed could not legally
be done; all which is more at large related in this Di&s;cour&s;e<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 419. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> of the Time
when tho&s;e Tran&s;actions pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;o need not to be repeated in this Place.</P>
<Q>THE SECOND Article was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;econd Ar|ticle.</NOTE> <HI>That He had, in the Hearing of many of his
Maje&s;ty's Subjects, fal&s;ely and maliciou&s;ly &s;aid,</HI> That the King was in
his Heart a Papi&s;t, popi&s;hly affected, <HI>or Words to that Effect.</HI></Q>
<P>HE &s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His An&s;wer.</NOTE> that He had Occa&s;ion too often, throughout the whole Charge,
to acknowledge and magnify the great Goodne&s;s of God Almighty, that, &s;ince
He thought not fit (for his greater Humiliation, and it may be to correct the
<MILESTONE N="30">Pride of a good Con&s;cience) to pre&s;erve him entirely from tho&s;e A&s;per&s;ions
of Infamy, and tho&s;e <HI>Flagella Linguae,</HI> tho&s;e Strokes of the Tongue, which
always leave &s;ome Mark or Scar in the Reputation they de&s;ire to wound;
He had yet infu&s;ed into the Hearts of his Enemies, who had &s;ugge&s;ted and
contrived this Per&s;ecution again&s;t him, to lay &s;uch Crimes to his Charge as
his Nature is known mo&s;t to abhor, and which cannot only not be believed,
but mu&s;t be contradicted, and a Vindication of him from that Guilt mu&s;t
be made, by all Men who know him to any Degree, or who have been
much in his Company. And as Ju&s;tice would have required it, &s;o the u&s;ual
Form in Ca&s;es of this Nature doth exact, that in &s;o general a Charge They
<MILESTONE N="40">&s;hould have named one &s;ingle Per&s;on of tho&s;e many, in who&s;e Hearing He
had laid that odious Imputation upon the King: And every Man will
pre&s;ume, that one &s;uch Per&s;on would have been named, if He could have
been found.</P>
<P>THERE was no Man then alive, He &s;aid, who had had the Honour to be
&s;o many Years about or near the Per&s;on of the King as He had been: No
Man, who knew more of the Temptation his Maje&s;ty had undergone, and
the A&s;&s;aults He had &s;u&s;tained, in the Matter of Religion, during the whole
Time of his Exile; when almo&s;t a total De&s;pair po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Spirits of mo&s;t
Men of his own Religion, that He would recover his Regality; and the
<MILESTONE N="50">Hopes and Promi&s;es and A&s;&s;urances were &s;o pregnant of very many of all
Conditions, that He would &s;uddenly recover it if He would change it. No
Man knew &s;o well, with what Chri&s;tian Courage his Maje&s;ty had repelled
<PB N="482" REF="488">
tho&s;e A&s;&s;aults, or with what pious Contempt and Indignation He re&s;i&s;ted
and rejected tho&s;e Temptations. Nor had any Man, He thought, held &s;o
many Di&s;cour&s;es with his Maje&s;ty concerning Religion as He had done;
and &s;ooner and more clearly di&s;cerned the Reproaches He would undergo
from that innate Candour in his princely Nature, which di&s;po&s;ed him to
receive any Addre&s;&s;es, or to hear any Di&s;cour&s;es, which tho&s;e of &s;everal Fac|tions
in Religion with great Pre&s;umption have u&s;ed to pre&s;ent to him:
Whil&s;t his Maje&s;ty hath, with equal Temper and &s;ingular Benignity, heard
all; and, pitying their Errours, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with Evidence, that their
Arguments were too weak to make Impre&s;&s;ion upon his Judgment. Which<MILESTONE N="10">
though They knew well, yet either Party, out of the Vanity of their
Hearts, u&s;ed all the Endeavours They could to get it believed, that the
King was propitious to them and their Party. And the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> being
mo&s;t pre&s;umptuous in particular, and in their dark Walks in &s;everal Coun|ties
making it a &s;pecial Argument to their Pro&s;elytes, and tho&s;e They en|deavoured
to make &s;o, that the King favoured them, and was of their
Religion in his Heart (of which, and the great Prejudice it brought upon
his Maje&s;ty, He frequently received Adverti&s;ements from many Per&s;ons of
Honour, and of warm Affections to the Government); of which He had
always informed the King, who was exceedingly offended at their Folly<MILESTONE N="20">
and Pre&s;umption, and wi&s;hed &startq;that &s;ome of them might be apprehended,
and pro&s;ecuted with the utmo&s;t Rigour; and that &s;ome &s;uch Pro&s;ecution
might be made again&s;t all the <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> and that They might be
convicted;&endq; which He always gave in Charge to the Judges accordingly.
And upon that and the like-Occa&s;ions He had a ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary Opportu|nity
to enlarge, in the Pre&s;ence of many Per&s;ons of Honour and Intere&s;t in
the Kingdom, upon the Sincerity of the King's Religion, and his con&s;tant
Exerci&s;e of it when He &s;uffered by it; giving &s;uch In&s;tances of many Par|ticulars
as were pertinent to the Di&s;cour&s;e: Of which Endeavours of his,
and of &s;ome Fruit thereof, He doubted not but that many of as con&s;ider|able<MILESTONE N="30">
Per&s;ons as are in <HI>England</HI> would be ready to give him their Te&s;timony.
And (He &s;aid) He might without Vanity &s;ay, that He had more than an
ordinary Part in the framing and promoting that Act of Parliament, that
hath made tho&s;e &s;editious Di&s;cour&s;es, <HI>of the King's being a</HI> Papi&s;t <HI>in his
Heart, or popi&s;bly affected,</HI> &s;o very penal as they are: And therefore there
would be Need of an undoubted and uncontroulable Evidence, that He
had &s;o &s;oon run into that Crime him&s;elf. Which was all He would for
the pre&s;ent &s;ay upon that &s;econd Article.</P>
<Q>THE THIRD Article was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third Ar|ticle.</NOTE> <HI>That He had received great Sums of Money for
pa&s;&s;ing the</HI> Canary <HI>Patent, and other illegal Patents; and granted &s;e|veral<MILESTONE N="40">
Injunctions to &s;top Proceedings at Law again&s;t them, and other il|legal
Patents formerly granted.</HI></Q>
<P>TO which He &s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His An&s;wer.</NOTE> that He had pre&s;umed in his humble Addre&s;s to the
Hou&s;e of Peers to a&s;&s;ure their Lord&s;hips, <HI>that He had never received one
Penny over and above the ju&s;t Perqui&s;ites of his Office, according to the Pre|cedents
and Practice of the be&s;t Times, which He conceived to be tho&s;e of the
Lord</HI> Coventry <HI>and the Lord</HI> Elle&s;mere; <HI>and which He had made his Rule
in all that He had received, excepting only what He had from the immediate
Bounty of the King.</HI> And as He had always done all that was in his Power
to prevent and &s;top all illegal Patents, &s;o He did believe that there would<MILESTONE N="50">
be more Patents then found in the Office, which had been &s;topped by him,
than by any of his Predece&s;&s;ors in &s;o &s;hort a Time. He never granted any
Injunctions in the Ca&s;es mentioned in the Charge, nor in any Ca&s;e, where,
<PB N="483" REF="489">
by the Cour&s;e of the Court and the Rules of Ju&s;tice, it was not warranted.
And for the <HI>Canary</HI> Patent, and the Original, and all the Proceedings
thereupon, &s;o much is &s;aid in the Body of this Di&s;cour&s;e according to the
Time it was tran&s;acted in<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Page 154. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>, that there needs no Repetition of it in this
Place.</P>
<Q>THE FOURTH Article was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fourth Article.</NOTE> <HI>that He had advi&s;ed and procured divers of
his Maje&s;ty's Subjects to be impri&s;oned again&s;t Law in remote I&s;lands,
Garri&s;ons and other Places; thereby to prevent them from the Benefit of
the Law, and to introduce Precedents for impri&s;oning of other of his
<MILESTONE N="10">Maje&s;ty's Subjects in like Manner.</HI></Q>
<P>TO which He &s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His An&s;wer.</NOTE> He knew not what An&s;wer to make to that Ar|ticle,
it being &s;o general, and no particular Per&s;on being named: But, He
&s;aid, it was generally known, that He had never taken it upon him to
commit any Man to Pri&s;on, but &s;uch who, by the Cour&s;e of the Chancery,
for Matters of Contempt are ju&s;tly and nece&s;&s;arily to be committed. It
was probable that He had been pre&s;ent at the Council-Board, when many
Per&s;ons had been ordered to be committed, and who&s;e Commitment hath
by the Wi&s;dom of that Board been thought ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary; and there|fore
He was not to an&s;wer apart for any Thing done by them. Only He
<MILESTONE N="20">might &s;ay, that He was frequently of Opinion that the Commitments were
very nece&s;&s;ary: And it was notoriou&s;ly known, that by &s;uch Commitments
&s;ome Rebellions or In&s;urrections had been prevented; and that other Per|&s;ons,
who were afterwards attainted and executed for High Trea&s;on, had
upon their Examinations and at their Death confe&s;&s;ed, that their Pur|po&s;e
had been to ri&s;e in Arms at &s;uch and &s;uch Times, if their Friends
upon whom They had principally relied had not been then committed to
Pri&s;on. And, He &s;aid, He did well remember, that it was thought fit that
mo&s;t of the Per&s;ons who &s;tand attainted for the Murder of the late King,
his Maje&s;ty's Royal Father, &s;hould be removed out of the <HI>Tower,</HI> and di&s;|per&s;ed
<MILESTONE N="30">into &s;everal I&s;lands and Garri&s;ons: And if any other Per&s;ons had
been likewi&s;e &s;ent thither, He pre&s;umed it was upon &s;uch Rea&s;ons, as
upon a due Examination thereof would make it appear to be very ju&s;t.</P>
<P>THE FIFTH Article was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fifth Ar|ticle.</NOTE> <HI>That He had corruptly &s;old &s;everal Offices con|trary
to Law.</HI></P>
<P>THIS He po&s;itively denied.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His An&s;wer.</NOTE></P>
<Q>THE SIXTH was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;ixth Ar|ticle.</NOTE> <HI>That He had procured his Maje&s;ty's Cu&s;toms to be farmed
at Underrates, knowing the &s;ame; and great pretended Debts to be
paid by his Maje&s;ty, to the Payment whereof his Maje&s;ty was not in
Strictne&s;s bound; and that He had received great Sums of Money for
<MILESTONE N="40">procuring the &s;ame.</HI></Q>
<P>TO this He &s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His An&s;wer.</NOTE> He had never had any Thing to do in the di&s;po&s;ing his
Maje&s;ty's Cu&s;toms, or any other Part of his Revenue, except for &s;ome &s;hort
Time after his Maje&s;ty's fir&s;t Arrival in <HI>England;</HI> when He, among&s;t others
of the Lords of the Council, was a Commi&s;&s;ioner for the Trea&s;ury: During
which Time there was no Farm let of any of the Revenue, and the Cu&s;|toms
were put into the Hands of Commi&s;&s;ioners, to the End that a Com|putation
might be made as near as was po&s;&s;ible of the full Value of them,
before that it &s;hould be put into a Farm, which every Man conceived would
be fit to be done as &s;oon as might be. The White Staff was &s;hortly after
<MILESTONE N="50">given to the Earl of <HI>Southampton</HI> (to whom his Maje&s;ty had de&s;igned it before
He returned), and the Chancellor&s;hip of the Exchequer to the Lord <HI>A&s;hley,</HI>
the Lord Chancellor having re&s;igned it into his Maje&s;ty's Hands, which
<PB N="484" REF="490">
He had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of for many Years in the Time of the late King, and
retained it till after his Maje&s;ty's Return: And from the Time that tho&s;e
two Officers of the Revenue were made, which determined the former
Commi&s;&s;ion, He never intermeddled in the Cu&s;toms, or in any other Branch
of the Revenue; except when the King commanded him to be pre&s;ent in
&s;ome Con&s;ultations which He had with the Lord Trea&s;urer, and when
there were other Lords of the Council pre&s;ent. That excellent Per&s;on, the
Lord Trea&s;urer, always re&s;orted to the King for his Direction, in all Mat|ters
of the lea&s;t Difficulty which occurred to him in the Admini&s;tration of
his Office; and frequently did de&s;ire to confer with the Chancellor (with<MILESTONE N="10">
whom He was known to have held a long and a fa&s;t Friend&s;hip) upon many
Particulars of his Office, believing that He was not altogether ignorant in
that Admini&s;tration, with which He had been formerly &s;o well acquainted.
And that He conceived might be the Rea&s;on, why He did oftentimes
procure him to be joined with him in References from the King, upon
Matters wholly relating to his own Office. But the Chancellor did never
then &s;uffer any particular Application to be made to him in tho&s;e Ca&s;es,
nor had ever &s;ecret Conferences with any Per&s;ons who were concerned in
tho&s;e Preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>WHAT was meant <HI>by his having procured his Maje&s;ty's Cu&s;toms to be<MILESTONE N="20">
farmed at Underrates, knowing the &s;ame; and great pretended Debts to be
paid by his Maje&s;ty, to the Payment whereof his Maje&s;ty was not in Strictne&s;s
bound;</HI> He &s;aid, He could not imagine, except it did relate to the Pay|ment
of a Debt due from his late Maje&s;ty to &s;ome of the Farmers. In which
though He had no more to do, than in giving Information and his particu|lar
Advice to his Maje&s;ty, in the Pre&s;ence of the Lord Trea&s;urer, the Chan|cellor
of the Exchequer, and other of the Lords, and &s;o was not him&s;elf
re&s;pon&s;ible for what his Maje&s;ty did thereupon; yet He thought him&s;elf
obliged upon this Particular, which &s;o much concerned the Honour and
Ju&s;tice of the late King and of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, to enlarge, and relate all<MILESTONE N="30">
He knew of what their Maje&s;ties did, and what induced his pre&s;ent Ma|je&s;ty
to do his Part in it.</P>
<P>HE &s;aid, it was notoriou&s;ly known, that before the late Troubles, and
in the very fir&s;t Entrance into them, his Maje&s;ty was nece&s;&s;itated to borrow
very great Sums of Money from his then Farmers of his Cu&s;toms, and to
oblige them to &s;tand per&s;onally bound for many other great Sums of
Money, which other Men lent to his Maje&s;ty upon their Security. That
thereupon, and for the Repayment of tho&s;e Sums which the Farmers had
advanced, and for &s;ecuring them from any Damage for tho&s;e Monies which
others had lent upon their Obligations; his late Maje&s;ty, with the Advice of<MILESTONE N="40">
the then Lord Trea&s;urer and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, had granted
a farther Lea&s;e of his Cu&s;toms to tho&s;e Farmers for three or four Years to
come, after the Expiration of their former Lea&s;e; with a Covenant on his
Maje&s;ty's Part, to pay the ju&s;t Intere&s;t for all &s;uch Monies as were advanced
by them, or for which They &s;tood bound; and likewi&s;e that They &s;hould,
out of their growing Rent, deduct &s;uch Sums of Money by the Year, as
They had lent or been bound for, according to &s;uch Proportions yearly as
was agreed upon. That it was as well known, that &s;hortly after the Be|ginning
of the Parliament in 1640, and before the Commencement of the
&s;econd Lea&s;e, the Hou&s;e of Commons did not only force the &s;aid Farmers<MILESTONE N="50">
to pay a very great Sum of Money for their Pre&s;umption in receiving Cu&s;|toms
and Impo&s;itions upon Merchandi&s;e in the former Years, when They
pretended &s;uch Payments were not due; but took al&s;o from them their new
<PB N="485" REF="491">
Lea&s;e granted to them by the King, and &s;o left them without any Capa|city
of reimbur&s;ing them&s;elves of the Money They had lent, and likewi&s;e
at the Mercy of their Creditors to whom They &s;tood bound; many of
whom quickly began to exerci&s;e that Severity towards them, that many of
the poor Gentlemen had their E&s;tates extended upon Judgments and Re|cognizances,
and their Per&s;ons taken in Execution and committed to Pri|&s;on;
where &s;ome of them who had been known to have great E&s;tates, as
Sir <HI>Paul Pindar</HI> and others, were forced to end their Lives.</P>
<P>THERE were very few Circum&s;tances in the late King's Misfortunes,
<MILESTONE N="10">which gave him more Trouble, or &s;o much afflicted him as the Sen&s;e He
had of the horrid and unju&s;t Sufferings tho&s;e poor Gentlemen underwent
for him, and their Affection for his Service; which He often publickly
mentioned, and as often declared, &startq;that He held him&s;elf obliged to make
them full Reparation as &s;oon as God &s;hould enable him.&endq; And He fre|quently
&s;pake to the Chancellor, who was then Chancellor of the Ex|chequer,
of that Affair; of the good Opinion He had of the Men,
and of the great Services They had done for his Maje&s;ty; and commanded
him expre&s;sly, when it &s;hould fall within his Power, He &s;hould do them
all the Right He could. And of this He had often informed his Maje&s;ty
<MILESTONE N="20">during the Time He was abroad, and after his Return, without any other
Motive than his Father's Command and his own Honour, having him&s;elf
never had any Degree of Friend&s;hip with any of the Per&s;ons concerned,
and a very ordinary Acquaintance with &s;ome of them. Upon his Maje&s;ty's
happy Return, tho&s;e Gentlemen who were alive of the old Farmers, who
were Sir <HI>John Jacob,</HI> Sir <HI>Job Harby,</HI> Sir <HI>Nicholas Cri&s;pe</HI> and Sir <HI>John Har|ri&s;on,</HI>
applied them&s;elves to the King, having lain &s;everal Years and at that
Time remaining in Execution in &s;everal Pri&s;ons, and having had their E&s;|tates
&s;old, upon the Pro&s;ecution of tho&s;e Creditors to whom They were
bound for Money lent to his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30">AS &s;oon as Mea&s;ures were taken for collecting the Revenue, tho&s;e four
Gentlemen named before, and two others who had &s;erved his Maje&s;ty very
well, were appointed his Commi&s;&s;ioners for the collecting the Cu&s;toms and
Duties upon Trade; in which Collection They continued a Year or there|abouts;
during which Time many of their Creditors, who had generou&s;ly
forbore to pro&s;ecute them whil&s;t They were in Pri&s;on and undone, begun
now to commence their Actions again&s;t them, pre&s;uming They were then
or would &s;hortly be able to &s;atisfy them. Whereupon the King com|manded
the Lord Trea&s;urer and the Chancellor, with &s;ome other Lords,
to &s;end for tho&s;e Creditors, and to declare to them, &startq;that his Maje&s;ty
<MILESTONE N="40">would in a &s;hort Time enable his Farmers to pay their ju&s;t Debts, which
He well knew were contracted for his Service; and that He would take
it very well from them, if They would for the pre&s;ent give no Ob&s;truc|tion
to his Service, by the Pro&s;ecution of tho&s;e Per&s;ons at Law, who&s;e
Time was &s;olely taken up in the nece&s;&s;ary Service of his Maje&s;ty.&endq; Where|upon
They willingly de&s;i&s;ted from that Pro&s;ecution; and many of them
finding now, that by his Maje&s;ty's Favour They were like to recover their
Debts They before thought to be de&s;perate, They frankly remitted the
Whole or Part of the Intere&s;t, that in Strictne&s;s of Law was &s;till due
to them.</P>
<MILESTONE N="50">
<P>HIS Maje&s;ty &s;hortly after, finding it be&s;t for his Profit to determine the
Collection by Commi&s;&s;ion, and to let the Whole to Farm, gave Direction
to the Lord Trea&s;urer to confer and treat with any fit Per&s;ons who de&s;ired
to contract for the &s;ame. Many Overtures were made by &s;everal Per&s;ons,
<PB N="486" REF="492">
and &s;ome applied them&s;elves directly to his Maje&s;ty. Upon which, and after
a competent Time in con&s;idering all that had been propo&s;ed, the King ap|pointed
a Day, when He would be attended by the Lord Trea&s;urer and
other of the Lords, and when all the Pretenders &s;hould likewi&s;e be pre&s;ent,
and He would then and there declare his own Judgment; having fir&s;t de|clared
to the Commi&s;&s;ioners, whereof four were the old Farmers to whom
&s;o much Money was due, &startq;that who&s;oever &s;hould take the Farm, They
&s;hould be obliged to pay them their ju&s;t Debt at &s;uch Times, and by
&s;uch Proportions, as his Service could bear. But as to the letting the
Farm it&s;elf, He would neither con&s;ider the Debt He owed them, nor the<MILESTONE N="10">
Sufferings They had undergone, but only the Rent They &s;hould offer;
which if as much as any Body el&s;e would give; He would prefer their
Per&s;ons before others; but if any other fit Men would offer more than
They thought fit to give, They &s;hould be his Farmers: And therefore
wi&s;hed them well to con&s;ider what They would propo&s;e to him.&endq;</P>
<P>AFTER two Days &s;pent by his Maje&s;ty with the &s;everal Pretenders apart,
and finding that the Propo&s;itions made to him by the old Farmers, with
whom the other two were to be joined who had &s;erved with them as Com|mi&s;&s;ioners,
were at lea&s;t as much if not more for his Profit than any that
had been made by any of the re&s;t; He did declare, that the Farm &s;hould<MILESTONE N="20">
be let to tho&s;e who had been his Commi&s;&s;ioners: Which at that Time was un|der&s;tood
to be &s;o far from being a good Bargain, that the two Commi&s;&s;ioners,
who were not concerned in the great Debt, utterly refu&s;ed to meddle with
the Farm at &s;o great a Rent; the other four publickly declaring at the &s;ame
Time, &startq;that They would not give the Rent but in Contemplation of their
Debt, which They thought They &s;hould &s;ooner and better receive, when
it &s;hould be a&s;&s;igned upon their own Collections, than when it &s;hould be
charged upon new Farmers.&endq; But They were Suitors to his Maje&s;ty,
&startq;that He would oblige the other two (Sir <HI>John Wolftenholme</HI> and Sir <HI>John
Shaw</HI>) to be joint Farmers with them;&endq; which his Maje&s;ty did, by making<MILESTONE N="30">
a gracious Promi&s;e to them, &startq;that if They &s;hould be Lo&s;ers He would re|pair
them:&endq; And thereupon Directions were given to Mr. Attorney Ge|neral
to prepare a Grant accordingly. And, He &s;aid, He did not know
that there was one di&s;&s;enting Voice from what his Maje&s;ty inclined to do
upon the whole Matter, the &s;ame appearing to every Man to be mo&s;t ju&s;t
and rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>THE Farm being thus &s;ettled, the old Farmers were directed &startq;to bring
their Accompts to the Lord Trea&s;urer and Chancellor of the Exchequer,
by which it &s;hould manife&s;tly appear how much the King was ju&s;tly and
truly indebted to them, and how the Debts were incurred; that &s;o upon<MILESTONE N="40">
a ju&s;t Computation &s;uch Satisfaction might be made to them, as was con|&s;i&s;tent
with the pre&s;ent State of his Maje&s;ty's Affairs and Occa&s;ions.&endq;
Many Months, if not a whole Year, were &s;pent in the Examination of tho&s;e
Accompts before the Auditors: Who, be&s;ides the Exceptions They took for
Want of &s;ome Formalities in the Proof of &s;ome Money paid, which
after twenty Years of Licen&s;e (in which all their Books and Papers had been
taken, their Hou&s;es plundered, and their Per&s;ons impri&s;oned; and in which
&s;o many Per&s;ons employed by the King to receive and by them to pay Money
were dead) could hardly be made with the u&s;ual Exactne&s;s; made likewi&s;e
&s;everal Certificates of particular Ca&s;es, which required farther Directions.<MILESTONE N="50">
And the Lord Trea&s;urer would never take upon him&s;elf to give tho&s;e Di|rections,
only declaring to them, as He had frequently done, &startq;that in Re|gard
his Maje&s;ty was not &s;trictly bound in Ju&s;tice to pay that Debt due
<PB N="487" REF="493">
from his Father, but that his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty's generous and Royal Di&s;|po&s;ition
had prevailed with him to pay that ju&s;t Debt, whereby They might
be pre&s;erved from Ruin, in which,&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;He had fully concurred
with his Maje&s;ty; but that He would never advi&s;e him, on the Contrary
He would always di&s;&s;uade his Maje&s;ty from paying or allowing any In|tere&s;t,
though paid by them, which would &s;well the Debt to &s;uch a Pro|portion,
that his Maje&s;ty could never undertake the Payment of it.&endq; Which
Determination, how great &s;oever their Lo&s;s appeared to be, &s;eemed to be
&s;o ju&s;t, at lea&s;t &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the King, that They wholly referred it to
<MILESTONE N="10">his Maje&s;ty; hoping that it might prevail with many of their Creditors not
to exact it from them, though the Sale of their whole E&s;tates had made Satis|faction
to others for the whole Intere&s;t, as well as for the Principal.</P>
<P>WHEN the Auditors Certificate was ready, and all the Doubts and
Que&s;tions that did ari&s;e thereupon were clearly &s;tated, his Maje&s;ty vouch&s;a&s;ed
again to be pre&s;ent with the other Lords, who had from the Beginning a&s;|&s;i&s;ted
in the Examination of that Bu&s;ine&s;s: And then the Lord Trea&s;urer
declared to his Maje&s;ty, what He had before &s;aid to the Per&s;ons concerned,
&startq;that though He willingly approved his Maje&s;ty's Goodne&s;s in taking upon
him&s;elf that great Debt, yet that He would by no Means give his Advice
<MILESTONE N="20">or Con&s;ent that He &s;hould pay or allow any Intere&s;t for it.&endq;</P>
<P>UPON the whole Matter, and upon all the Doubts &s;tated to his Maje&s;ty,
and after the Rejection of &s;everal of the Sums of Money which were de|manded
by them, and for the Payment whereof &s;uch direct Proof was not
made as is required by the Cour&s;e of the Exchequer (though, He &s;aid,
He thought mo&s;t Per&s;ons who were pre&s;ent were in their private Con|&s;ciences
well &s;atisfied, that tho&s;e Sums had been in Truth paid to his Ma|je&s;ty's
U&s;e, as had been alleged); there appeared to his Maje&s;ty to be
ju&s;tly due to them the Sum of two hundred thou&s;and Pounds; Principal|Money,
for almo&s;t twenty Years, and for which They had paid the Intere&s;t
<MILESTONE N="30">for many Years out of their own E&s;tates. And his Maje&s;ty thought it very
ju&s;t; and, with many gracious Expre&s;&s;ions of his Purpo&s;e and Re&s;olution
further to repair them as He &s;hould be able, gave Order to the Lord Trea|&s;urer,
&startq;that the &s;aid Debt of two hundred thou&s;and Pounds &s;hould be paid
to them in five Years, that is, by forty thou&s;and Pounds for every Year,
out of the Rent of the Farm; and that all In&s;truments nece&s;&s;ary for their
Satisfaction and Security &s;hould be pre&s;ently given to them, whereby They
might be able to comply with their Creditors, and avoid their Impor|tunity,&endq;
wherewith his Maje&s;ty begun to be troubled as much as them|&s;elves.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40">HE did confe&s;s him&s;elf to have been pre&s;ent at tho&s;e Agitations, and to
have contributed his humble Advice and Opinion to his Maje&s;ty that He
&s;hould pay this Debt; which He thought him&s;elf obliged to do, as well as
a faithful Coun&s;ellor to his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, as in Di&s;charge of his Duty and
Obligation to his Father. And, He &s;aid, He had very good Rea&s;on to be|lieve,
that if that two hundred thou&s;and Pounds be paid according to his
Maje&s;ty's Direction, and of which the Heirs and Executors of tho&s;e Farmers
who are dead, as well as the four pre&s;ent Farmers, have their equal Propor|tions;
the &s;aid Per&s;ons have not at this Day Half the E&s;tates They had in
the Year 1640, when They entered into tho&s;e Engagements for his Maje&s;ty.
<MILESTONE N="50">Nor was there any one Per&s;on pre&s;ent at the Agitation of this Affair, who
&s;eemed in the lea&s;t Degree to differ in the Opinion, or to di&s;&s;uade his Ma|je&s;ty

<P><PB N="488" REF="494">
HE &s;aid, He did likewi&s;e very willingly confe&s;s, that He had in the
Manner afore&s;aid, and being called to advi&s;e, given his Opinion for the Pay|ment
of many other con&s;iderable Debts incurred by his late Maje&s;ty, and
for which many Per&s;ons of Honour, who adhered to him during that War,
were per&s;onally bound for him, and who&s;e E&s;tates had been extended and
their Per&s;ons impri&s;oned for the &s;ame; many of whom were in Execution
and in Pri&s;on for the &s;ame when his Maje&s;ty returned, and others were then
&s;ued in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI> in his Maje&s;ty's own Courts. His late Maje&s;ty

He did not deny, that He was never more glad, than when He was able

<P>BUT having made tho&s;e clear Confe&s;&s;ions of what was Truth, and what

that ever He procured or advi&s;ed the letting his Maje&s;ty's Cu&s;toms, or any
other Part of his Revenue, at Underrates: On the Contrary, that He u&s;ed all
the Ways He could to advance the Rents, without Re&s;pect of Per&s;ons; and
that He was never pre&s;ent at the letting any Farm that any Men would
have given more for, than They did to whom it was let, what Offers &s;oever
were made afterwards, when his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf had made a Contract, and
when a Grant was i&s;&s;ued accordingly under the Great Seal of <HI>England.</HI> And

or any other Part of his Revenue; or for the Payment of any one
Debt made by his Maje&s;ty, to which He was or was not bound: He having
(He &s;aid) never had any other Motive for the Performance of tho&s;e Offices,
but the pure and entire Con&s;ideration of his Maje&s;ty's Honour, Ju&s;tice and
Profit, and his own Inclination to gratify worthy Per&s;ons, who in Ju&s;tice

<Q>THE SEVENTH Article was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;eventh Article.</NOTE> <HI>That He had received great Sums of Money

<P>HE &s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His $word$.</NOTE> if He had been in the lea&s;t Degree guilty of that Charge, it
would very ea&s;ily have been proved; and the Vintners would very gladly

to him, and &s;o not obliged to conceal any of his Corruptions. They well
knew, that He could never be prevailed with to con&s;ent to the enhancing the
Prices of their Wines, and that He never had received from them the lea&s;t
Sum of Money, or other Gratuity from them, in his Life. He &s;aid, He
did remember, that at a Time when his Maje&s;ty had refu&s;ed to grant all<MILESTONE N="50">

were &s;o many Informations again&s;t them pro&s;ecuted by Informers in the

his Maje&s;ty thought it worthy of his Mercy to &s;helter them for the

pay them &s;uch rea&s;onable Rewards for their Pains as He thought fit; and
thereupon He &s;hould enter a <HI>Noli Pro&s;equi:</HI>&endq; But his Maje&s;ty charged them
for the future not to run into the &s;ame Danger.&endq; And as this Grace
<MILESTONE N="10">from his Maje&s;ty was not upon his Promotion, but purely from his own
Bounty and Goodne&s;s, from which Nobody di&s;&s;uaded him; &s;o He never re|ceived
the lea&s;t Profit from the &s;ame.</P>
<Q>THE EIGHTH is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The eighth Article.</NOTE> <HI>That He had in a &s;hort Time gained to him&s;elf
a far greater E&s;tate, than can be imagined to be lawfully gained in

Grants under the Great Seal from his Maje&s;ty, to him&s;elf and to his
Relations, of &s;everal of his Maje&s;ty's Lands, Hereditaments and Lea&s;es,

<P>TO this He &s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His An&s;wer.</NOTE> that He wi&s;hed with all his Heart, that the Truth of
<MILESTONE N="20">that Article (which He pre&s;umed had drawn on all the re&s;t) were clearly
known to all the World: And that They, who in Truth do believe that
He hath &s;o great an E&s;tate, were well informed what it is; and They
would then clearly di&s;cern that He needed not be a&s;hamed of having gotten
&s;uch an E&s;tate, nor that He needed to have any Recour&s;e to any ill Arts or
Means for the obtaining thereof. They would know, that He had been &s;o
far from <HI>procuring &s;everal Grants under the Great Seal of</HI> England <HI>from his
Maje&s;ty, to him&s;elf and his Relations, of &s;everal of his Maje&s;ty's Lands, He|reditaments
and Lea&s;es, to the Di&s;profit of his Maje&s;ty;</HI> that He never
moved his Maje&s;ty in his Life for any one Grant to him&s;elf or any of his

his Father and him&s;elf near thirty Years in &s;ome Tru&s;t and Employment;
He &s;aid, He hoped it &s;hould not be imputed as a Crime in him to receive
his Favours. He was far from believing or imagining, that the poor Services
He had ever done, or could do, were in any Degree proportionable to his
Maje&s;ty's Bounty: Yet &s;ince his Maje&s;ty's Goodne&s;s had thought him fit for
it, He hoped many others would think &s;o too; at lea&s;t as fit as &s;ome Men,
who had received greater Marks and Proportions of it than He had done,
and who, though They might &s;erve much better, had not &s;erved &s;o long.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40">HE &s;aid, He forbore to enlarge upon that Charge, becau&s;e He conceived
that it was now evident to many, who had been wrought upon by tho&s;e

the Information They received was without Ground: And whoever con&s;iders,
that the fir&s;t Year after the King's Return yielded ju&s;tly more Profit to the
Great Seal than He ever received in all the Years following, and &s;ome par|ticular
Acts of Bounty conferred on him by his Maje&s;ty, without the lea&s;t
Suit from him, and unthought of by him, will believe that his Fault was
greater in having no better an E&s;tate, than that what He hath hath been
gotten by Corruption. He &s;aid, He hath none of his Maje&s;ty's Lands, but
<MILESTONE N="50">what He had bought, for as much as any Body would pay for it, of tho&s;e
who had the &s;ame granted to them by his Maje&s;ty's Bounty, and that Grant
confirmed to them by Act of Parliament. And He pre&s;umed that it could

yielded any Thing to the Crown, He ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to receive it, becau&s;e
it was generally thought to be of great Value; and therefore He would not
expo&s;e him&s;elf to the Envy which naturally attends tho&s;e Donations,
having in Truth never had an immoderate Appetite <HI>to make Ha&s;te to be rich;</HI>
and had as much apprehended the being accu&s;ed of Witchcraft or Burglary,
as of Bribery and Corruption.</P>
<P>IN a Word: He did declare, that, his Debts being di&s;charged, for which
He paid Intere&s;t, all his E&s;tate was not worth, being &s;old, the Money that<MILESTONE N="10">
He had received from his Maje&s;ty's own Royal Bounty, and far from being
&s;uitable to the Quality He yet held, and which was never obtained by his
own Ambition, as many Per&s;ons of Honour could te&s;tify.</P>
<Q>THE NINTH Article was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ninth Ar|ticle.</NOTE> <HI>That He had introduced an arbitrary Govern|ment
in his Maje&s;ty's foreign Plantations; and had cau&s;ed &s;uch as com|plained

<P>TO this He &s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His An&s;wer.</NOTE> that though He could not po&s;&s;ibly comprehend the full
Meaning of that Article, yet becau&s;e He had heard of many Di&s;cour&s;es made
of the Authority that He a&s;&s;umed to him&s;elf over the Plantations, and the<MILESTONE N="20">
great Advantage and Benefit that He had drawn to him&s;elf from thence,
He was very willing to take that Occa&s;ion to relate all that He knew, and
all that He had done, with Reference to any of his Maje&s;ty's Plantations;
declaring in the fir&s;t Place, that at his Maje&s;ty's Return, and before, He
had u&s;ed all the Endeavours He could to prepare and di&s;po&s;e the King to a
great E&s;teem of his Plantations, and to encourage the Improvement of
them by all the Ways that could rea&s;onably be propo&s;ed to him. And He
had been confirmed in that Opinion and De&s;ire, as &s;oon as He had a View
of the Entries in the Cu&s;tomhou&s;e; by which He found what a great Re|venue
accrued to the King from tho&s;e Plantations, in&s;omuch as the Receipts<MILESTONE N="30">
from thence had upon the Matter repaired the Decrea&s;e and Diminution of
the Cu&s;toms, which the late Troubles had brought upon other Parts of
Trade, from what it had formerly yielded.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Con&s;ideration that offered it&s;elf before the King that related to
the Plantations, was concerning the <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> which having been mo&s;t
di&s;cour&s;ed of &s;ince, and, as He had heard, with &s;ome Reflections upon him
of Partiality and Inju&s;tice, He &s;aid, He would in the fir&s;t Place &s;et down all
He knew in that Affair, and how He came to meddle in it.</P>
<P>BEFORE the Beginning of the late Troubles, the King had granted the
I&s;land of the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> to the Earl of <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> and his Heirs for ever, upon a<MILESTONE N="40">
Suppo&s;ition that it had been fir&s;t di&s;covered, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and planted at his
Charge: And the &s;aid Earl &s;ent a Governour and People thither, and en|joyed
it to his Death; and by his Will &s;ettled it for the Payment of his
Debts, which were very great. The Troubles falling out in a &s;hort Time
after, little or no Profit had been drawn from thence towards the Satisfac|tion
of tho&s;e Debts; and the Executors and Tru&s;tees totally neglected the
taking Care of it, or pro&s;ecuting the Plantation. But in and after the War
many Citizens, Merchants and Gentlemen, who were willing or forced to
withdraw them&s;elves from <HI>England,</HI> tran&s;ported them&s;elves thither, and
planted without a&s;king any Body's Leave, and without being oppo&s;ed or<MILESTONE N="50">
contradicted by any Body.</P>
<P>ABOUT the Year 1647, or thereabouts, the late Earl of <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> Son and
Heir of the former Earl, to whom the Inheritance of that I&s;land belonged,
<PB N="491" REF="497">
treated with the late Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> of <HI>Parham,</HI> how that I&s;land might be
&s;o hu&s;banded, that the Plantation might be advanced, and Profit made by
it; which would at la&s;t redound to him&s;elf, when the Debt &s;hould be paid.
The late King was then in the Hands of the Army: And with his Ma|je&s;ty's
Approbation and Con&s;ent, it was agreed between the &s;aid Earl and
the &s;aid Lord, &startq;that a Lea&s;e &s;hould be made by the Earl of <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> to the
Lord <HI>Willoughby,</HI> of all the Profits which &s;hould ari&s;e out of that Planta|tion,
for the Term of twenty one Years or thereabouts; a Moiety of the
whole Profits to be received by the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> him&s;elf for his own
<MILESTONE N="10">U&s;e, in Recompen&s;e for his Pains and Charge. And He was likewi&s;e to
receive a Commi&s;&s;ion from the &s;aid Earl, to be Governour of that and the
re&s;t of the <HI>Caribbee</HI> I&s;lands&endq; (all which were comprehended in the Charter
granted by the King to the Earl of <HI>Carli&s;le</HI>); &startq;and that a Commi&s;&s;ion
&s;hould be likewi&s;e procured from the King or the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> by
which the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> was to be con&s;tituted Governour of the &s;aid
I&s;lands.&endq;</P>
<P>ABOUT that Time the Fleet in the <HI>Downs</HI> returned to their Obedience to
the King, withdrawing them&s;elves to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Holland</HI> to offer their Ser|vice
to the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> his Maje&s;ty that now is; the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI>
<MILESTONE N="20">then likewi&s;e coming over to him, to &s;erve him in any Condition his High|ne&s;s
would employ him in. That Summer being pa&s;&s;ed without any good
Succe&s;s, the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> then informed the Prince of what had pa&s;&s;ed
between the Earl of <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> and him with the King his Father's Con&s;ent;
which his Highne&s;s had likewi&s;e received from his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf, with
much Recommendation of the Lord <HI>Willoughby.</HI> He &s;aid, He was then at|tending
upon the Prince in <HI>Holland,</HI> as one of the King's Council a&s;&s;igned
by his Maje&s;ty for that Service. Upon the under&s;tanding this whole Ca&s;e,
the Prince, upon the unanimous Advice of the Council, thought fit to grant
&s;uch a Commi&s;&s;ion of Governour of the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> and the other I&s;lands, as
<MILESTONE N="30">He de&s;ired: And He had the more Rea&s;on to de&s;ire it (notwith&s;tanding
the Earl of <HI>Carli&s;le's</HI> Grant and Commi&s;&s;ion), becau&s;e the principal Planters
upon the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> had been Officers in the King's Army, or of manife&s;t
Affections to him, and always looked upon as of his Party.</P>
<P>WITH this Commi&s;&s;ion the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> had, at his great Charge
and Expen&s;e, tran&s;ported him&s;elf to the <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and was there received
as Governour; and made a Contract with the Planters, &startq;that &s;o much
&s;hould be paid upon the Hundred to the Earl of <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI>&endq; to whom the
Propriety of the Whole belonged. But before this Agreement could be well
executed, or any Profit drawn from thence, the I&s;land was reduced to the
<MILESTONE N="40">Obedience of the Parliament and of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and a Governour appointed
by them; the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> being &s;ent into <HI>England,</HI> where He remained
till the King's Return, and had given unque&s;tionable Evidence of his Affec|tion
to the King's Service, for which He had often been committed to Pri|&s;on
before and after <HI>Cromwell's</HI> Death.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as the King returned, the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> (who had then
eight or nine Years to come of his Lea&s;e formerly granted to him by the
Earl of <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> who was then likewi&s;e living, and ready to do any other
Act to the Lord <HI>Willoughby's</HI> Advantage) re&s;olved to return him&s;elf to the
<HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and de&s;ired the King to renew his Commi&s;&s;ion to him for the
<MILESTONE N="50">Government; which his Maje&s;ty was very willing to do, as to a Per&s;on He
e&s;teemed very much, and who had &s;pent very much of his own Fortune, as
was notoriou&s;ly known, in that Service. But the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> and all tho&s;e other
I&s;lands were now become of another Con&s;ideration and Value, than they
<PB N="492" REF="498">
had been of before the Troubles: The <HI>Barbadoes</HI> it&s;elf was (by that Conflu|ence
and Re&s;ort thither as was mentioned before) &s;o fully planted, that there
was no Room for new Comers, and They had &s;ent very many of their People
to the other I&s;lands to plant; many Citizens of <HI>London</HI> had rai&s;ed very great
E&s;tates there, and every Year received a very great Revenue from thence;
and the King's Cu&s;toms from that one I&s;land came to a very great Sum of
Money yearly.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e Men, who had entered upon that Plantation as a wa&s;te Place,
and had with great Charge brought it to that Perfection, and with great
Trouble, begun now to apprehend, that They mu&s;t depend upon the Good-Will<MILESTONE N="10">
of the Earl of <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> and Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> for the Enjoyment of their
E&s;tates there, which They had hitherto looked upon as their own. All
the&s;e Men joined together in an Appeal to the King, and humbly prayed&startq;
his Protection, and that They might not be oppre&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e two Lords.&endq;
They pleaded, &startq;that They were the King's Subjects; that They had re|paired
thither as to a de&s;olate Place, and had by their Indu&s;try obtained a
Livelihood there, when They could not with a good Con&s;cience &s;tay in
<HI>England.</HI> That if They &s;hould be now left to tho&s;e Lords to ran&s;om
them&s;elves and compound for their E&s;tates, They mu&s;t leave the Country;
and the Plantation would be de&s;troyed, which yielded his Maje&s;ty &s;o good<MILESTONE N="20">
a Revenue. That They could defend them&s;elves by Law again&s;t the Earl
of <HI>Carli&s;le's</HI> Title, if his Maje&s;ty did not countenance it by a new Grant
of the Government to the Lord <HI>Willoughby:</HI> And therefore They were
Suitors to his Maje&s;ty, that He would not de&s;troy them by that Counte|nance.&endq;</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame Time, the Creditors of the late Earl of <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> (whole Debts
were to be &s;atisfied by the Profits of that Plantation, by the Will and
Settlement of the &s;aid Earl) petitioned the King, &startq;that They might be in
the fir&s;t Place provided for: Their Principal-Money due to them at the
Death of the Earl amounted to no le&s;s than fifty thou&s;and Pounds, of<MILESTONE N="30">
which They had never yet received one Penny; and therefore that the
Profits which &s;hould ari&s;e ought in the fir&s;t Place to be applied to them,
there having been many Families utterly ruined for Want of their Monies
&s;o due to them.&endq; The King appointed to hear all their &s;everal Pretences
at the Council-Board, where They all attended with their Council: And after
his Maje&s;ty had &s;pent three or four Days him&s;elf in hearing the &s;everal Allega|tions,
finding new Pretences and Difficulties every Day to ari&s;e (which &s;hall
be mentioned anon), the King appointed &s;everal of the Lords of the Council
&startq;to con&s;ider of the whole Matter, and to confer with the &s;everal Parties, and,
if it were po&s;&s;ible, to make an End between them by their own Con&s;ent;<MILESTONE N="40">
otherwi&s;e to report the &s;everal Titles to his Maje&s;ty, with &s;uch Expedients as
in their Judgments They thought mo&s;t like to produce a general Satisfaction,
without endangering the Plantation,&endq; the Pre&s;ervation whereof his Maje&s;ty
took to Heart. The Chancellor was one of that Committee, and took very
much Pains in reading the Charters, Grants and Lea&s;es, and many other Papers
and Di&s;patches which concerned that Affair; and conferred with &s;everal of the
Per&s;ons intere&s;ted; to the End that He might the better di&s;cern what could
be done, having never under&s;tood or heard any Thing of the Matter, or
that concerned that Plantation, otherwi&s;e than what He hath before &s;et down
upon the Di&s;patch of the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> to <HI>Holland;</HI> nor had He the<MILESTONE N="50">
lea&s;t Inclination or Bias to any Party. Upon the hearing all the Allegations
before the Lords, the &s;everal Pretences and Titles appeared to them to be
the&s;e; which They afterwards reported to the King.</P>
<P><PB N="493" REF="499">
THE Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> demanded Nothing from the King, but his Com|mi&s;&s;ion
to be Governour for the Remainder of the Years which had been
granted to him by the Earl of <HI>Carli&s;le;</HI> to the End that He might receive one
Moiety of tho&s;e Profits which &s;hould ari&s;e to the Earl, and which had been
a&s;&s;igned to him with the Con&s;ent and Approbation of the late King, and of
his Maje&s;ty that now is; upon which He had undertaken that Voyage, and
&s;pent &s;o much of his E&s;tate.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> whil&s;t this Contention was depending, died, and
by his Will devi&s;ed his Intere&s;t in the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> to the Earl of <HI>Kinnoul,</HI> who
<MILESTONE N="10">likewi&s;e petitioned the King for the Pre&s;ervation of his Right: But neither
He, nor the Per&s;on under whom He claimed, had any Pretence till all the
Debts &s;hould be &s;atisfied; nor did the Earl of <HI>Kinnoul</HI> demand any Thing
till then, but believed the Profit would ari&s;e yearly to &s;o much, that the
Debts would quickly be &s;atisfied, and then the Whole was to come to him.</P>
<P>THERE was another Title that preceded the Earl of <HI>Carli&s;le's,</HI> which was
that of the Earl of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> who alleged, and proved it to be true,&startq;
that the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> and tho&s;e adjacent I&s;lands were fir&s;t granted by the King
to his Grandfather the Earl of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> who was then Lord High
Trea&s;urer of <HI>England,</HI> before the Earl of <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> had any Pretence there|unto;
<MILESTONE N="20">and that the Lord Trea&s;urer had afterwards con&s;ented that the &s;ame
&s;hould be granted to the Earl of <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> upon a full Contract, <HI>that He
&s;hould fir&s;t receive for ever the Sum of three hundred Pounds by the Year out
of the fir&s;t Profits of the Plantations;</HI> which Sum of three hundred Pounds
had never been yet paid: And therefore the Earl of <HI>Marlborough</HI> de&s;ired,
as Heir to his Grandfather, to have Satisfaction for the Arrears, and that
the growing Rent might be &s;ecured to him.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Creditors were of two Kinds: The fir&s;t, and who had fir&s;t peti|tioned
the King, as was &s;aid before, had an A&s;&s;ignment made to them by
the Executors and Tru&s;tees of the Earl of <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> upon his Will, and who
<MILESTONE N="30">at his Death owed them the full Sum of fifty thou&s;and Pounds or there|abouts.
The other Creditors con&s;i&s;ted of &s;everal Trade&s;men and Artificers,
to whom the &s;aid Earl was indebted for Wares and Goods which They had
delivered for his U&s;e; and of &s;everal Servants for their Arrears of Wages:
And all tho&s;e had, during the late Troubles, exhibited their Bill in Chan|cery
again&s;t the Executors and Over&s;eers of the late Earl, and had obtained
a Decree in that Court for their Satisfaction out of the Profits of tho&s;e Plan|tations
(which Decree &s;tood confirmed by the late Act of Judicial Proceed|ings);
and, as He remembered, their Debts amounted to thirty thou&s;and
Pounds or thereabout. None of the Creditors in general, of one or the other
<MILESTONE N="40">Sort, had ever received one Shilling from the Time that the Earl had fir&s;t
a&s;&s;igned it.</P>
<P>THE Planters in&s;i&s;ted po&s;itively, &startq;that the Charter granted to the Earl
of <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> by the King was void in Point of Law:&endq; For which their
Council alleged many Rea&s;ons. And having &s;pent much Time upon that
Argumentation, They concluded with two humble Propo&s;itions to the King.
(1.)&startq;That his Maje&s;ty would give them Leave to pro&s;ecute in his Name
in the Exchequer, and at their own Charge, to repeal that Grant to the
Earl of <HI>Carli&s;le;</HI> by which They &s;hould be freed from the arbitrary Power
and Oppre&s;&s;ion which would be exerci&s;ed upon them under the Colour of
<MILESTONE N="50">that Charter, and his Maje&s;ty might receive a great Benefit to him&s;elf, by
taking the Sovereignty into his own Hands, to which it belonged. And
in that Ca&s;e They offered in their own Names, and for the re&s;t of the
Planters who were in the I&s;land, to con&s;ent to an Impo&s;ition of &s;o much
<PB N="494" REF="500">
in the Hundred, which They confidently averred would amount in the
Year to ten thou&s;and Pounds at the lea&s;t; out of which his Maje&s;ty's Go|vernour
might be well &s;upported, and his Maje&s;ty di&s;po&s;e of the Overplus
as He &s;hould think fit.&endq; (2.) &startq;If his Maje&s;ty would not &s;uffer the Charter
to be repealed, that He would leave tho&s;e who claimed under the Earl
of <HI>Carli&s;le's</HI> Patent to their Remedy at Law, and leave the Planters to
their own Defence; which They hoped in Ju&s;tice could not be denied to
them, &s;ince They alone had been at the Charge to &s;ettle the Plantation,
which brought every Year &s;o great a Revenue to the Crown, when the
Earl had not been at the lea&s;t Expen&s;e thereupon: And if his Maje&s;ty<MILESTONE N="10">
&s;hould not a&s;&s;i&s;t their Pretences with his Royal Authority, They mu&s;t all
quit the Plantation.&endq;</P>
<P>THESE being the &s;everal Pretences of the &s;everal Per&s;ons, and Nothing
being to be done by Agreement between them&s;elves, their Intere&s;ts being &s;o
di&s;tinct and incon&s;i&s;tent with each other; his Maje&s;ty thought fit, in the
fir&s;t Place, to refer the Con&s;ideration of the Validity and Legality of the Pa|tent
to his Council at Law; who, upon full Deliberation and after the Hearing
of all Parties, returned their Opinion &startq;that their Patent was void, and that
his Maje&s;ty might take the &s;ame into his own Power.&endq; This Report was
no &s;ooner made to his Maje&s;ty, but that He very graciou&s;ly declared, &startq;that<MILESTONE N="20">
He would not receive from hence any Benefit or Advantage to him&s;elf,
until all their Pretences had received Satisfaction; and that He would make
no farther U&s;e of avoiding the &s;aid Charter, than to di&s;po&s;e the Profits of
the Plantation to tho&s;e, who in Ju&s;tice had any Pretence in Law or
Equity to receive the &s;ame: And therefore that the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI>
&s;hould proceed in his Voyage to the <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and &s;hould receive ac|cording
to his Bargain a Moiety of the Profits; and that the other Part
&s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed of for the Satisfaction of the Debts and other Incum|brances.&endq;
In Order to which, his Maje&s;ty appointed the &s;ame Committee
of the Lords to meet again, and to adju&s;t the &s;everal Proportions.<MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>WHEN They met again, They had all the Per&s;ons concerned with them,
or ready to be called in upon any Occa&s;ion; and They all appeared very
glad that the King had taken the Care and Protection of the Plantation upon
him&s;elf, which was all the Security the Planters had or could de&s;ire. And
the Lords fir&s;t Care was, to make &s;ome Computation that might be de|pended
upon, as the yearly Revenue that would ari&s;e upon the Impo&s;ition
within the I&s;land. But the Planters would not be drawn to any particular
Agreement in that Point, not &s;o much as to con&s;ent to what &s;hould be im|po&s;ed
upon every Hundred; but on the Contrary declared, &startq;that too much
had been undertaken in that Kind by one of their own Number, Mr.<MILESTONE N="40">
<HI>Kendall,</HI> in his Di&s;cour&s;e before the King in the Council,&endq; and declared&startq;
that the Plantation could not bear the Impo&s;ition He had mentioned.
That what&s;oever was to be done of that Nature was to be tran&s;acted by an
A&s;&s;embly in the I&s;land: And that all that They could promi&s;e for them|&s;elves
was, that They would u&s;e their utmo&s;t Endeavours with their Friends
in the I&s;land, that when the Lord <HI>Willougbby</HI> &s;hould arrive there and call
an A&s;&s;embly, They &s;hould con&s;ent to as great an Impo&s;ition as the Planta|tion
would bear; by which,&endq; They &s;aid, &startq;a good Revenue would ari&s;e
to the King for the Purpo&s;es afore&s;aid.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Creditors had great Rea&s;on to be glad of the Re&s;olution his Maje&s;ty<MILESTONE N="50">
had taken: For though it would be a long Time before They could be
fully &s;atisfied out of a Moiety of the Profits, though it &s;hould ari&s;e to the
highe&s;t Computation, yet in Time They &s;hould receive all, and &s;hould every
<PB N="495" REF="501">
Year receive &s;ome; which would le&s;&s;en their Debt, and relieve tho&s;e who
were in the highe&s;t Nece&s;&s;ities, of which there was a great Number. Whereas
They had hitherto in &s;o many Years received not one Penny: And it was
evident, that without his Maje&s;ty's Authority They never &s;hould, &s;ince the
Planters were re&s;olved never to con&s;ent to any Impo&s;ition, nor &s;ubmit to any
Authority that &s;hould be exerci&s;ed under the Earl of <HI>Carli&s;le's</HI> Patent, with|out
a due Cour&s;e of Law; the Way to obtain which would be very diffi|cult
to find out. And They under&s;tood well enough, that, without his
Maje&s;ty's Grace and Bounty to them, the Repeal or avoiding the Earl of
<MILESTONE N="10"><HI>Carli&s;le's</HI> Patent would put a quick End to all their Pretences.</P>
<P>THE greate&s;t Difficulty that did ari&s;e was from the Earl of <HI>Kinnoul,</HI> to
whom the la&s;t Earl of <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> had devi&s;ed the&s;e I&s;lands by his Will: And
He had a great Mind to go thither him&s;elf, and take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Right;
and his Council had per&s;uaded him, &startq;that the King's Charter granted to the
fir&s;t Earl of <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> was good and valid in Law, and that They believed
They could defend and maintain it in any Court of Ju&s;tice.&endq; Then his own
E&s;tate in <HI>Scotland</HI> was &s;o totally lo&s;t by the Iniquity of the Time, and his
Father's having &s;o frankly declared him&s;elf for the King, when very few of
that Nation lo&s;t any Thing for their Loyalty, that He had very little left to
<MILESTONE N="20">&s;upport him&s;elf; and therefore was willing to retire into any Place abroad,
where He might find but a bare Sub&s;i&s;tance. But when He con&s;idered
again, that He could have no Pretence to any Thing till after the Creditors
were fully &s;atisfied, and how long it was like to be before They could be
&s;atisfied, there remaining &s;till due to the Creditors of Both Kinds no le&s;s than
four&s;core thou&s;and Pounds, Principal-Money; He did not believe that his in|&s;i&s;ting
upon the Patent would be worth the Charge and Hazard He mu&s;t
inevitably be put to: And therefore, upon farther Deliberation with his
Friends, He willingly referred him&s;elf and all his Intere&s;t to the King's gra|cious
Determination, as all the re&s;t of the Pretenders and intere&s;ted Per&s;ons
<MILESTONE N="30">had done.</P>
<P>THE Ca&s;e being thus fully &s;tated to the Lords, and every Man's Intere&s;t
and Pretence clearly appearing before them, They con&s;idered &s;eriou&s;ly
among&s;t them&s;elves what They might rea&s;onably propo&s;e to the &s;everal Per|&s;ons,
in Order to their Agreement among&s;t them&s;elves; or, that proving in|effectual,
what Advice They might rea&s;onably give his Maje&s;ty. They were
unanimou&s;ly of Opinion, &startq;not to advi&s;e his Maje&s;ty to cau&s;e the Patent to be
called in Que&s;tion: For though They doubted not, upon the Opinion of
his learned Council, that the &s;ame would be judged void and illegal; yet
They did not think it a &s;ea&s;onable Time, when the Nation was &s;o active and
<MILESTONE N="40">indu&s;trious in foreign Plantations, that They &s;hould &s;ee a Charter or Patent
que&s;tioned and avoided, after it hath been &s;o many Years allowed and coun|tenanced,
and under which it hath &s;o long flouri&s;hed, and was almo&s;t grown
to Perfection. And that &s;ince his Maje&s;ty had declared, <HI>that, notwith&s;tanding
any Right of his own, all po&s;&s;ible Care &s;hould be taken for the Satisfaction of
the Creditors, as well as for the Pre&s;ervation and Support of the Plantation;</HI>
it would be equally equitable and honourable in his Maje&s;ty, not to leave the
Earl of <HI>Kinnoul</HI> the only Per&s;on uncon&s;idered, and bereaved of all his Pre|tence.
But that They would humbly move his Maje&s;ty, that He would gra|ciou&s;ly
vouch&s;afe to a&s;&s;ign &s;ome pre&s;ent Maintenance to the &s;aid Earl, which
<MILESTONE N="50">his unhappy Condition required, out of the Revenue that &s;hould be there &s;et|tled,
and until the Debts &s;hould be paid; and that after that Time &s;uch an
Augmentation might be made to him, as his Maje&s;ty in his Royal Bounty
&s;hould think &s;it: In Con&s;ideration whereof, the Earl &s;hould procure the
<PB N="496" REF="502">
Patent to be brought in and &s;urrendered;&endq; which He promi&s;ed &s;hould be
done accordingly, as &s;oon as the Settlement &s;hould be made of that Propor|tion
which &s;hould be a&s;&s;igned to him.</P>
<P>&startq;THAT the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> &s;hould enjoy the Benefit of his former Con|tract
with the Earl of <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> and approved by his Maje&s;ty, during the Re|mainder
of tho&s;e Years which are not yet expired; that He &s;hould make
what Ha&s;te He could thither, and call an A&s;&s;embly, to the End that &s;uch
an Impo&s;ition might be agreed upon to be paid to his Maje&s;ty as &s;hould be
rea&s;onable, in Con&s;ideration of the great Benefit They had already and
&s;hould &s;till enjoy, in being continued and &s;ecured in their &s;everal Planta|tions,<MILESTONE N="10">
in which as yet They were as it were but Tenants at Will, having
no other Pretence of Right but the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: And therefore, that tho&s;e
Merchants and Planters who had petitioned the King &s;hould, according to
their Obligation and Promi&s;e made by them to his Maje&s;ty, u&s;e all their
Credit with tho&s;e in the I&s;land, that the Impo&s;ition might ari&s;e to &s;uch a
Proportion, that the Revenue might an&s;wer the Ends propo&s;ed; and that
one Moiety of that Revenue &s;hould be enjoyed by the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI>
for his Term.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;THAT the Annuity of three hundred Pounds by the Year &s;hould be paid
to the Earl of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> according to the original Contract mentioned<MILESTONE N="20">
before; and that the A&s;&s;ignment, that his Maje&s;ty would likewi&s;e be plea&s;ed
to make to the Earl of <HI>Kinnoul,</HI> &s;hould be fir&s;t paid: And then that the
Remainder of that Moiety &s;hould be received to the U&s;e of the Creditors.
And that when the Lord <HI>Willoughby's</HI> Term &s;hould be expired, his Maje&s;ty
&s;hould be de&s;ired, after the Re&s;ervation of &s;o much as He &s;hould think fit
for the Support of his Governour, that all the Remainder might be conti|nued
towards the Creditors, until their ju&s;t Debts &s;hould be paid.&endq;</P>
<P>THESE Particulars appearing rea&s;onable to the Lords, all Per&s;ons con|cerned
were called, and the &s;ame communicated to them, who appeared all
well contented: And thereupon the Lords re&s;olved to pre&s;ent the &s;ame to<MILESTONE N="30">
his Maje&s;ty, which They did accordingly at the Board; and his Maje&s;ty
with a full Approbation and Advice of the whole Council ratified the &s;ame.
Whereupon that Order was made by the King in Council, which compre|hends
all the Particulars mentioned before; which was delivered to the Lord
<HI>Willoughby,</HI> with his Maje&s;ty's expre&s;s Command, &startq;that He &s;hould fee it
punctually and preci&s;ely executed;&endq; and the like Order was delivered by
the Clerk of the Council to every other Per&s;on mentioned, who de&s;ired the
&s;ame: To which Order He did for the more Certainty refer him&s;elf, being
in no Degree confident (having then no other Help than his Memory), that all
was &s;et down with that Exactne&s;s as it ought to be. And, He &s;aid, as He<MILESTONE N="40">
had throughout the whole Affair taken very great Pains to reduce it to that
Agreement, which at that Time &s;eemed to be &s;atisfactory to all the Per&s;ons
concerned, &s;o He had not the lea&s;t Temptation of particular Benefit to
him&s;elf; and He did &s;till believe it to be very ju&s;t, rea&s;onable, and
agreeable to his Maje&s;ty's Ju&s;tice and Goodne&s;s, all Circum&s;tances being
con&s;idered. And though it may be, in Strictne&s;s of Law, and by the
avoiding the Grant made to the Earl of <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> his Maje&s;ty might have
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the whole I&s;land, without any tender Con&s;ideration of
the Planters or the Creditors; He &s;aid, He was not a&s;hamed that He had
never given his Maje&s;ty that or the like Coun&s;el, in that or any other Matter<MILESTONE N="50">
of the like Nature; and if He had, He was confident his Maje&s;ty would
have abhorred it, and not have thought the better of him for giving it.</P>
<P><PB N="497" REF="503">
THE other Part of that Article, <HI>That He had cau&s;ed &s;uch as complained
of the arbitrary Government in the Plantations before the King and Council,
to be long impri&s;oned for &s;o doing,</HI> did refer, He &s;uppo&s;ed, to the Commit|ment
of one <HI>Farmer;</HI> who, being &s;ent over a Pri&s;oner by the Lord <HI>Wil|loughby</HI>
in a Ship that came from thence, made his Appearance at <HI>Oxford,</HI>
his Maje&s;ty being then there in the Sickne&s;s-Time, which, He &s;aid, was the
fir&s;t Moment that He had ever heard of the Man or the Matter. And at the
&s;ame Time one of the Secretaries of State received a Letter from the Lord
<HI>Willoughby,</HI> which was &s;ent by the &s;ame Ship, in which his Lord&s;hip had
<MILESTONE N="10">&s;ent a direct, full Charge of Mutiny, Sedition and Trea&s;on, again&s;t the &s;aid
<HI>Farmer;</HI> and by his Letter informed the Secretary of all his Behaviour and
Carriage, with all the Circum&s;tances thereof; and &startq;that He had, by his
&s;editious Practices, prevailed &s;o far upon a di&s;affected Party in that I&s;land,
that the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> found him&s;elf obliged in the In&s;tant to &s;end him
on Board the Ship, without which He did apprehend a general Revolt in
the I&s;land from his Maje&s;ty's Obedience:&endq; And He did therefore de&s;ire,&startq;
that <HI>Farmer</HI> might not be &s;uffered to return thither before the I&s;land
&s;hould be reduced to a better Temper.&endq; The Man was called in before
the King and Council, and the Charge that the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> had &s;ent
<MILESTONE N="20">read to him, the greate&s;t Part whereof He could not deny; and in his
Di&s;cour&s;e upon it He behaved him&s;elf &s;o peremptorily and in&s;olently before
the King, that his Maje&s;ty thought it very nece&s;&s;ary to commit him; nor did
any one Coun&s;ellor then pre&s;ent appear to think otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>AND He did confe&s;s, that the di&s;charging him from his Impri&s;onment was
&s;ome Time afterwards moved, and that He was always again&s;t his Di&s;charge;
being of Opinion that it would be impo&s;&s;ible for the Lord <HI>Willoughby,</HI> or
any other Governour in any of the Plantations, to pre&s;erve his Maje&s;ty's Right
and to &s;upport the Government, if He &s;hould be &s;o far di&s;countenanced,
that a Man, being &s;ent over by him as a Pri&s;oner under &s;o particular and
<MILESTONE N="30">heinous a Charge, &s;hould be upon his Appearance here &s;et at Liberty. But
his Opinion was, &startq;that He &s;hould be &s;ent back a Pri&s;oner thither, that He
might be tried by the Law and Ju&s;tice of the I&s;land, and receive condign
Puni&s;hment for his Offence:&endq; And, He &s;aid, He could not deny but
that He was &s;till of the &s;ame Opinion; and, if it were an Errour, it pro|ceeded
from the Weakne&s;s of his Under&s;tanding, which was not in his Power
to reform.</P>
<P>HE &s;aid, what He had here &s;et down was all that occurred to his Me|mory
with Reference to the I&s;land of the <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> which being not par|ticularly
mentioned in the Article, but comprehended under the general
<MILESTONE N="40">Expre&s;&s;ion of his Maje&s;ty's foreign Plantations, and &s;ecretly and maliciou&s;ly
in&s;inuated in private Di&s;cour&s;es, He took him&s;elf to be obliged to give &s;ome
An&s;wer to what, how generally &s;oever, had been charged. And He hoped
it would not be imputed as a Crime to him, if He had taken more Pains
than other Men in that important Service of his Maje&s;ty concerning his foreign
Plantations, which He did not think had been enough taken to Heart: And
if his De&s;ire and Readine&s;s to take any Pains, or give any A&s;&s;i&s;tance to the
Advancement of that Service, had induced many Per&s;ons to apply them&s;elves
to him on tho&s;e Occa&s;ions, He hoped it &s;hould not be charged upon him
as Over-Activity, or Ambition to engro&s;s more Bu&s;ine&s;s into his Hands than
<MILESTONE N="50">He was entitled to; for which He had this Excu&s;e to make for him&s;elf, that
He found the Pains He took to be acceptable to his Maje&s;ty. And He was
&s;o far from having any particular De&s;ign of Advantage to him&s;elf, that He
did profe&s;s and declare, that from all or any of his Maje&s;ty's Plantations He
<PB N="498" REF="504">
never had the lea&s;t Reward, or lea&s;t Pre&s;ent made to him; except that
the now Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> once told him, &startq;that his Brother had &s;ent over
&s;ome Pieces of the &s;peckled Wood which grows in <HI>Surinam,</HI> with Direc|tion,
that if He liked it He might have what He would of it;&endq; where|upon
He had &s;ome Pieces of it, which He thought might have been ap|plied
to the making of Cabinets or the adorning of Wain&s;cot (but as they
were very &s;mall, &s;o the Middle of every Piece was wind-&s;haken and rotten,
that they could not be applied to any con&s;iderable U&s;e); and except &s;ome
Blocks of Walnut-Tree which the Governour of <HI>Virginia</HI> &s;ent to him, and
of which He made &s;ome Table-Boards and Frames for Chairs; the Work|man&s;hip<MILESTONE N="10">
whereof co&s;t much more than the Wood was worth. And the&s;e

<PB N="499" REF="505">
never take him&s;elf to be beholden to him for that or any other Service; as
in Truth He never was.</P>

Letters Patents under the Great Seal of</HI> England <HI>to one Dr.</HI> Crowther
<HI>to be altered, and the Enrollment thereof to be unduly razed.</HI></Q>
<P>TO which He &s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His An&s;wer.</NOTE> that when He heard of this Charge, He could not
comprehend what the Meaning thereof was, being mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured that He had
never <HI>cau&s;ed any Alteration to be made in any of his Maje&s;ty's Letters Patents
under the Great Seal, or the Enrollment thereof to be razed.</HI> But upon
<MILESTONE N="10">Inquiry He was informed, that Dr. <HI>Crowther,</HI> who was Chaplain to his

That when He brought his Action again&s;t the Intruder, who refu&s;ed to
give him Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and the Record was carried down to the A&s;&s;izes in the
County; when the Doctor's Council were to open his Title, and there|upon
to produce the King's Pre&s;entation, They found upon Peru&s;al thereof,
<MILESTONE N="20">that either by Mi&s;information or Negligence of the Clerk, in&s;tead of the
County of <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> where the Rectory was, the County of <HI>Warwick</HI> was
in&s;erted: Upon which Mi&s;take the Doctor was nece&s;&s;itated to be non&s;uited.
And thereupon He forthwith made a Journey to <HI>London</HI> to advi&s;e with his

that had befallen him, and that his Maje&s;ty's Right might not be de&s;troyed

in&s;erting any one Particular to which He might make his Defence. He
<MILESTONE N="40">had therefore no more to &s;ay, but that He was very innocent as to any
Crime laid to his Charge in that Article: And that He had been &s;o far
from <HI>examining and drawing into Que&s;tion any of his Maje&s;ty's Subjects con|cerning
their Lands, Tenements, Goods and Chattels, and Properties, and
determining the &s;ame at the Council-Table, and &s;topping Proceedings at Law;</HI>
that He did not know or believe, that any one Ca&s;e of that Nature had

Command, or by Order of the Board; which was always upon &s;ome<MILESTONE N="10">
Mi&s;carriage or Mi&s;behaviour in the Corporation: And that He did not re|member
that He had ever moved the King again&s;t any particular Corpo|ration
but that of <HI>Wood&s;tock;</HI> and which his Duty to his Maje&s;ty had
obliged him to do, being intru&s;ted by his Maje&s;ty with the Command of
his Hou&s;e and Park there, and being his Maje&s;ty's Steward of his Maje&s;ty's
Honour and Manor of <HI>Wood&s;tock,</HI> upon which that Borough had always
depended.</P>
<P>HE &s;aid, his Maje&s;ty having conferred that Charge upon him, He was
no &s;ooner po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it by the Death of the late Earl of <HI>Lind&s;ey,</HI> who en|joyed
that Place before, than He received a Petition from &s;everal Inha|bitants<MILESTONE N="20">

&startq;that the Mayor and Ju&s;tices had lately procured their Charter to be re|newed,
without the Privity or Con&s;ent of the Borough; and that under
Pretence of renewing it, They had procured many new Clau&s;es to be in|&s;erted,
and thereby reduced much of the Government, which before de|pended
on the whole Corporation, into their own Hands; and had
thereby likewi&s;e procured a Piece of Ground, the Benefit whereof did
formerly belong to all the Burge&s;&s;es, and was u&s;ually applied to the Re|lief
of &s;uch of them who were decayed in their E&s;tates, to be now granted
to the Mayor and a &s;elect Number of the Ju&s;tices, and the Profits thereof<MILESTONE N="30">
to be at their Di&s;po&s;al, to the great Prejudice of the Borough and the
Inhabitants thereof.&endq; He referred this Petition to Mr. Ju&s;tice <HI>Morton,</HI>
who lived within four or five Miles thereof, and de&s;ired him to examine
the Truth of tho&s;e Allegations, and to certify him whether the Complaints
were ju&s;t and rea&s;onable. Whereupon He took the Pains to go to the
Town, and to confer with the Mayor and Ju&s;tices, and heard the Alle|gations
of the Petitioners; and upon the whole Matter certified, &startq;that He
found &s;everal important Alterations in the new Charter from what had
been in the old, and &s;ome new Conce&s;&s;ions.&endq;</P>
<P>AND at the &s;ame Time Sir <HI>William Fleetwood,</HI> who was Ranger of the<MILESTONE N="40">
Parks, certified him, &startq;that &s;ince the renewing their Charter, the Mayor
and Ju&s;tices were not &s;o good Neighbours to his Maje&s;ty's Game as They
had formerly been, and had withdrawn many of tho&s;e Services which
They had u&s;ed to perform: And that when any Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es were com|mitted
by tho&s;e of the Borough upon his Maje&s;ty's Woods or Game, which
happened very frequently, and Complaint was thereof made to the Mayor
and Ju&s;tices, who had the &s;ole Juri&s;diction within the Borough; there
was &s;o &s;light and perfunctory Examination thereof, that the Pro&s;ecutors
were wearied out, and no Ju&s;tice could be obtained.&endq;</P>
<P>THAT it was his Duty to inform the King of tho&s;e Proceedings, who<MILESTONE N="50">

General to bring a <HI>Quo Warranto,</HI> and to repeal the Charter which
had been &s;o unduly procured, and in which his Maje&s;ty had been &s;o gro&s;sly

Ju&s;tices for &s;ome Time had pretended that They would &s;urrender the &s;aid
Charter, and receive a new one in &s;uch a Manner as his Maje&s;ty thought
fit, though They afterwards changed their Mind. And this was the only
Charter, He &s;aid, which He gave Direction for the Pro&s;ecution of.</P>
<P>NOR did He ever give Order, upon the Receipt of any Money, <HI>to

remember, did amount to thirteen Shillings and four Pence, or thereabouts.</P>
<Q>THE FIFTEENTH Article was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fifteenth Article.</NOTE> <HI>That He procured the Bills of Settle|ment

<MILESTONE N="20">And therein it appears what Money the Chancellor received from <HI>Ireland,</HI>

but to very many of tho&s;e, who promoted the Accu&s;ation directly contrary
to what They knew to be true.</P>
<Q>THE SIXTEENTH Article was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;ixteenth Article.</NOTE> <HI>That He had deluded and betrayed his Ma|je&s;ty

<P>TO which He &s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His An&s;wer.</NOTE> that He did heartily wi&s;h that tho&s;e particular Treaties,
and the Particulars in tho&s;e Treaties, had been mentioned, wherein it was
<MILESTONE N="30">conceived that He had deluded and betrayed his Maje&s;ty, that He might at
large have &s;et down what&s;oever He had known or done in tho&s;e Treaties;
and then it would ea&s;ily have been made appear, how far He had been
from betraying or deluding him. That it was never any Ambition of his
own that brought him to have a Part in any Treaty: He &s;aid, God knew,
that He heartily wi&s;hed to have meddled in Nothing, but the Admini&s;tra|tion
of that great Office the King had thought fit to have tru&s;ted him with.
But his Maje&s;ty had then &s;o good an Opinion of him, that He required and
commanded his Service in many of tho&s;e Treaties: And therefore it would
be nece&s;&s;ary for him, according to the Method He had hitherto u&s;ed, to
<MILESTONE N="40">mention every particular Treaty that had been entered into &s;ince the Time
of his Maje&s;ty's Return into <HI>England,</HI> and the Part that He had in it; being
as willing to be called to the &s;tricte&s;t Account for any other Treaty He had
been engaged in when He had been abroad, or for any Coun&s;el He had ever
given in his Life, publick or private; wherein, He doubted not, He &s;hould
be found to have behaved him&s;elf (according to the weak Abilities God had
given him) with Fidelity to his Ma&s;ter, and with all imaginable Affection
to his Country, how unhappily &s;oever He had been repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Treaty, He &s;aid, was with the Crown of <HI>Portugal;</HI> in which
He was none of the Commi&s;&s;ioners who treated, and was only pre&s;ent when
<MILESTONE N="50">any Report was made by the Commi&s;&s;ioners to the King, or to the Council|Board,
where all the Articles were debated; and He did not remember
that there had been any Difference of Opinion upon any of them: And
<PB N="502" REF="508">
that Treaty had been generally held the be&s;t that hath been made with any
Crown, the Merchants having thereby greater Advantages in Trade than
They have in any other Place, be&s;ides many other great Benefits, with a great
Enlargement of his Maje&s;ty's Empire.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd Treaty was with the <HI>States</HI> of the <HI>United Provinces;</HI> in which
likewi&s;e He was none of the Commi&s;&s;ioners who treated: But all that was
by them tran&s;acted was &s;till brought to the Council-Board, and debated
there in his Maje&s;ty's Pre&s;ence; in which the Rule by which his Maje&s;ty
guided him&s;elf was, that He would not remit any of tho&s;e Conce&s;&s;ions which
had been formerly made by them in their la&s;t Treaty with <HI>Cromwell;</HI> and<MILESTONE N="10">
their Unwillingne&s;s to con&s;ent to that was the Rea&s;on that their Amba&s;&s;a|dours
proceeded &s;o &s;lowly. And his Maje&s;ty had the le&s;s Rea&s;on to be &s;oli|citous
for Expedition, becau&s;e the King of <HI>France</HI> had given his Royal Word,
and propo&s;ed it him&s;elf, &startq;that the two Crowns might proceed in the &s;everal
Treaties with the <HI>Dutch</HI> together, that &s;o They might be brought to tho&s;e
good Conditions, that They might live like good Neighbours with Both
the Crowns, which,&endq; He ob&s;erved, &startq;They were not naturally inclined to
do;&endq; and promi&s;ed po&s;itively, &startq;that for his Part He would not conclude
any Thing with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> before He had entirely communicated the
&s;ame to his Maje&s;ty.&endq; Notwith&s;tanding which Engagement, <HI>France</HI> en|tered<MILESTONE N="20">
into and fini&s;hed their Treaty; and in it made that &s;ecret Article,
which They declared afterwards to be the Ground of their Obligation to
a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>Dutch</HI> in the en&s;uing War. However, his Maje&s;ty proceeded not
till the <HI>Holland</HI> Amba&s;&s;adours con&s;ented to all that had been before granted
to <HI>Cromwell:</HI> Which being done, the Peace was made and ratified on Both
Sides; and without Doubt was with more Advantage and Honour to the
<HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> than ever had been provided by any former Treaty between the
Crown of <HI>England</HI> and tho&s;e <HI>States.</HI></P>
<P>FROM the two Crowns of <HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Denmark</HI> Amba&s;&s;adours Extraordi|nary
arrived at <HI>London</HI> &s;hortly after the King's Return, and the &s;everal Treaties<MILESTONE N="30">
were made with Both tho&s;e Crowns before the Departure of the Amba&s;&s;a|dours:
In neither of which Treaties the Chancellor was a Commi&s;&s;ioner,
nor knew any Thing that pa&s;&s;ed in either, but as it was repre&s;ented at
the Council-Board, and debated in his Maje&s;ty's Pre&s;ence; nor did He
ever hear that either of them was reckoned a di&s;advantageous Treaty, Both
of them containing as much Benefit to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> as any Treaties which
had been made before with tho&s;e Crowns. He &s;aid, it was very true, that
there were &s;ome unu&s;ual Expre&s;&s;ions of Kindne&s;s and Friend&s;hip in the
Treaty with <HI>Denmark;</HI> which, in Re&s;pect of that King's being at that Time
in a very low Condition, under the di&s;advantageous Conditions of the Treaty<MILESTONE N="40">
at <HI>Copenhagen</HI> newly &s;ubmitted to, and under almo&s;t as ill a Treaty extorted
from that Crown by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and yet being in terrible Apprehen&s;ion of
&s;ome new Oppre&s;&s;ion from the one and from the other, the Amba&s;&s;adour
did very earne&s;tly &s;olicit to have in&s;erted; and which were upon great De|liberation
allowed and in&s;erted by his Maje&s;ty's own particular Direction, in
Con&s;ideration of the near Alliance in Blood between his Maje&s;ty and that King,
and the Civilities and Obligations his Maje&s;ty had received from <HI>Denmark,</HI>
during his being in <HI>Holland</HI> after the Murder of his Father, and during his
being in <HI>Scotland,</HI> when the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> &s;ent him Hor&s;es, Arms and
Ammunition. Of which his Maje&s;ty had &s;o great a Sen&s;e, that He was<MILESTONE N="50">
often heard to &s;ay, &startq;that if it had plea&s;ed God to have brought him Home
before that di&s;advantageous Peace at <HI>Copenhagen</HI> had been made&endq; (which
had been done by the Countenance of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships, and the Threats
<PB N="503" REF="509">
of tho&s;e who were then Amba&s;&s;adours from the governing Power in <HI>Eng|land),</HI>
&startq;He would have done the be&s;t He could to have defended and pro|tected
him:&endq; And therefore He did very readily yield to that Article drawn
by the Amba&s;&s;adour; his Maje&s;ty declaring at the &s;ame Time, &startq;that He
was very willing that tho&s;e Princes who were Neighbours to <HI>Denmark,</HI> and
from whom that Kingdom apprehended new Oppre&s;&s;ions, &s;hould know
his Maje&s;ty's Re&s;olutions to &s;upport that King, and to defend him
from new Injuries;&endq; to which the Policy of his Government, as well as
his Friend&s;hip, inclined and obliged him; though it is very true, the King
<MILESTONE N="10">of <HI>Denmark</HI> did &s;hortly after make very ill Returns to his Maje&s;ty for that
his &s;o &s;ignal Affection.</P>
<P>THESE were all the Treaties made by the King before the War with the
<HI>Dutch</HI> (for there was very little Progre&s;s made either with <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Spain</HI>
for the Rea&s;ons mentioned before), except only a &s;hort Treaty with the
Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh;</HI> which Treaty was, for the mo&s;t Part, particular
with Reference only to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> his Maje&s;ty's Nephew, and for
the better ordering his Affairs. In which Treaty his Maje&s;ty likewi&s;e employed
five or &s;ix of his Council: And the few Articles between his Maje&s;ty and
that Elector in Point of State were likewi&s;e tran&s;acted by them, and debated
<MILESTONE N="20">and con&s;idered at the Council-Board, and in which all Things were in&s;erted
for his Maje&s;ty's Benefit and Service; and if they had not been afterwards
violated by the Elector, the King would have reaped much Fruit and Ad|vantage
even from that Treaty.</P>
<P>AFTER the War was entered into with <HI>Holland,</HI> his Maje&s;ty &s;ent Mr. <HI>Co|ventry</HI>
to <HI>Sweden,</HI> and Sir <HI>Gilbert Talbot</HI> to <HI>Denmark,</HI> to di&s;po&s;e tho&s;e two
Crowns to a Confidence in each other, and then to di&s;po&s;e them Both to
adhere to his Maje&s;ty, or at lea&s;t not to a&s;&s;i&s;t or favour the <HI>Dutch.</HI> The
Treaty with <HI>Sweden</HI> &s;ucceeded to his Maje&s;ty's Wi&s;h, and was concluded
in a League defen&s;ive, very much to the King's Satisfaction, and with the
<MILESTONE N="30">full Approbation of the whole Board; that Crown having manife&s;ted &s;o
much Affection, and &s;uch an Inclination to an entire Conjunction with him,
that upon very rea&s;onable Conditions They would have been induced to have
entered into a League offen&s;ive, and even into the pre&s;ent War again&s;t the
<HI>Dutch:</HI> In Order to which, They &s;ent their Amba&s;&s;adours to the King at
the &s;ame Time when Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> returned, and They became the Me|diators
for the Peace; having fir&s;t declared to his Maje&s;ty, &startq;that if the
Treaty &s;hould prove ineffectual, the Crown of <HI>Sweden</HI> would immediately
join with his Maje&s;ty again&s;t the <HI>Dutch.</HI>&endq; What became of the other
Treaty with <HI>Denmark</HI> is publickly known, his Maje&s;ty having declared to
<MILESTONE N="40">all the World how perfidiou&s;ly He was treated by the <HI>Dane.</HI></P>
<P>THERE remains only one other Treaty to be mentioned, which is the la&s;t
with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> upon which the Peace was made: And therefore it will
be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;et down the Inducements to that Treaty, the whole Pro|gre&s;s
and Conclu&s;ion of it; by all which it will ea&s;ily appear that his Ma|je&s;ty
was neither betrayed nor deluded in it, or, if He were, that it was not
done by him.</P>
<P>AFTER &s;o many Encounters and various Succe&s;&s;es in the War, which had
been carried on with a much greater Expen&s;e than his Maje&s;ty at his fir&s;t En|trance
into it was per&s;uaded it would co&s;t him; when He &s;aw the Strength
<MILESTONE N="50">and Power of the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;o much increa&s;ed by the Conjunction of <HI>France</HI>
and <HI>Denmark,</HI> who &s;upplied them with Money, Ships, and, what They
more wanted, with Men as many as They de&s;ired; and that all the Propo|&s;itions
He could make to <HI>Spain</HI> could not induce them to enter into &s;uch
<PB N="504" REF="510">
an Alliance with him, as might embark them again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> notwith|&s;tanding
it was evident to all but them&s;elves, that the <HI>French</HI> re&s;olved to
break the Peace with them, having at that Time publi&s;hed tho&s;e Declara|tions
which They afterwards made the Ground of the War: His Maje&s;ty
clearly di&s;cerned, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> grew le&s;s weary of the War than They had
before &s;eemed to have been; and that They would be able, with that A&s;|&s;i&s;tance
and Conjunction, to continue the War with le&s;s Inconvenience than
his Maje&s;ty was like to do.</P>
<P>He had found it nece&s;&s;ary for &s;treightening the Trade of the Enemy (the
depriving them of which could only induce them to de&s;ire a Peace, and<MILESTONE N="10">
which He could not do by the Strength of his own Ships, which were &s;till
kept together to encounter their Fleet), to grant Commi&s;&s;ions upon Letters
of Marque to as many private Men of War as de&s;ired the &s;ame, and with
&s;uch &s;trict Orders and Limitations as are nece&s;&s;ary in tho&s;e Ca&s;es; and He
found indeed the Advantage very great, in the Damage tho&s;e Men of War
did to the Enemy, which was con&s;iderable, and gave them great Trouble.
On the other Side, the common Seamen cho&s;e much rather to go on Board
tho&s;e Men of War, where their Profit out of their Shares of the Booty was
greater, and their Hazards much le&s;s, than in the King's Ships, where They
got only Blows without Booty, though their Pay and Provi&s;ions were much<MILESTONE N="20">
greater than they had been in any former Time: So that when the Royal
Fleet was to be &s;et out, there was greater Difficulty in procuring Seamen
and Mariners to man it.</P>
<P>AND then, whereas the Advancement of Trade was made the great End
of the War, it was now found nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uppre&s;s all Trade, that there
might be Mariners enough to furni&s;h the Ships for the carrying on the War.
And this Inconvenience produced another Mi&s;chief: For by the great Dimi|nution
and even Suppre&s;&s;ion of Trade, there was likewi&s;e &s;o great a Fall in
the Cu&s;toms, Exci&s;e, and all other Branches of the King's Revenue, that
it was evident enough that his Maje&s;ty would have little to carry on the War,<MILESTONE N="30">
but what &s;hould ari&s;e by Impo&s;ition in Parliament upon the People; who
already complained loudly of the Decay of their Rents, of the &s;mall and low
Prices which their Commodities yielded by the Ce&s;&s;ation of Trade, and e&s;|pecially
by the carrying all the Money <HI>in Specie</HI> from the &s;everal Counties
to <HI>London,</HI> for the carrying on the War. And the Parliament it&s;elf ap|peared
&s;o weary of it, that in&s;tead of granting a new Supply proportionable
to the Charge, They &s;ell upon Expedients to rai&s;e Money by the Sale of Part
of the King's Revenue, which was already too &s;mall to &s;upport the ordinary
and nece&s;&s;ary Expen&s;e of the Crown.</P>
<P>BUT above all, his Maje&s;ty was mo&s;t di&s;couraged by the extreme Licen&s;e<MILESTONE N="40">
of the Seamen in general; but e&s;pecially of tho&s;e who were called Privateers,
&s;et out in the particular Ships of War upon Adventure, who made no Di&s;|tinction
between Friends and Foes; but, as if the Sea had been their own
Quarters, They &s;eized upon all Ships which pa&s;&s;ed within their View, and
either pillaged them entirely and &s;o di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them (which They u&s;ually did
to tho&s;e which They fore&s;aw would be delivered by the Cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice),
or el&s;e brought them into the Harbours, after They had taken from them
what They be&s;t liked. And then the formal Proceedings in the Court of
Admiralty were &s;o dilatory, and involved in &s;o many Appeals, that the
Pro&s;ecution of Ju&s;tice for Injuries received grew as grievous as the Injury<MILESTONE N="50">
it&s;elf; which drew an univer&s;al Clamour from all Nations, &startq;that without
being Parties to the War They were all treated as Enemies.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="505" REF="511">
FRANCE had made the Damage They had this Way received, and the
Interruption of their Trade, a great Part of their Quarrel, and one Ground
of their Conjunction with the <HI>Dutch.</HI> From <HI>Spain,</HI> which really wi&s;hed
better to us than to our Enemies, the Complaints were as great; &startq;that their
whole Trade was de&s;troyed; their Ships of <HI>Flanders,</HI> which &s;upplied <HI>Spain</HI>
with what They wanted for them&s;elves, and with what was nece&s;&s;ary for
their Trade and Intercour&s;e with the <HI>Indies,</HI> were all taken as <HI>Dutch,</HI> be|cau&s;e
it was very hard to di&s;tingui&s;h them by their Language:&endq; Which
was likewi&s;e the Ca&s;e of all the <HI>Han&s;e-Towns,</HI> which made grievous Com|plaints,
<MILESTONE N="10">and had without Doubt received great Damage. Tho&s;e Princes of
<HI>Italy</HI> who&s;e Dominions reached to the Sea, as the two Republicks of <HI>Ve|nice</HI>
and <HI>Genoa,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Florence,</HI> expo&s;tulated very grievou&s;ly for
their Ships taken by tho&s;e Freebooters of <HI>Scotland</HI> and of <HI>Ireland,</HI> Both
which Nations enriched them&s;elves very much upon &s;uch Depredations. And
how much &s;oever the Royal Navy was weakened every Day, the Number of
tho&s;e Men of War wonderfully increa&s;ed; &s;o that tho&s;e Kind of Ships, of
<HI>England, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> covered the whole Ocean: And of tho&s;e
Ships which were taken and carried into <HI>Scotland</HI> or <HI>Ireland</HI> (in <HI>England</HI>
there were many Redeliveries), it was ob&s;erved, that there were <HI>Ve&s;|tigia
<MILESTONE N="20">nulla retror&s;um.</HI> Even <HI>Sweden</HI> it&s;elf, with whom a new &s;tricter Al|liance
was entered into at that Time, with as &s;evere Re&s;trictions to that Li|cen&s;e
of the Men of War as could be contrived for the Liberty and Security
of the Trade of that Crown, complained exceedingly of the Violation of all
tho&s;e Conce&s;&s;ions and Provi&s;ions, and that their Ships were every Day taken
and plundered. And this univer&s;al Complaint began to awaken all Princes
to a Jealou&s;y, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> endeavoured to re&s;train all Trade, till They
could make them&s;elves the entire Ma&s;ters of it, and by their naval Power
put &s;ome Impo&s;ition upon the whole Traffick of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>IT is very true, at the fir&s;t Entrance into the War there had been many
<MILESTONE N="30">un&s;kilful Expre&s;&s;ions even in the Parliament it&s;elf, as well as in the frequent
Di&s;cour&s;es of Parliament-Men, &startq;that by this War, and by &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the
Power of the <HI>Dutch</HI> at Sea&endq; (of which They made not the lea&s;t Doubt),&startq;
the King would be able to give the Law to all the Trade of the World,
and that no Ships &s;hould pa&s;s the Sea without paying &s;ome Tribute to <HI>Eng|land:</HI>&endq;
Which Liberty and Ra&s;hne&s;s of Di&s;cour&s;e made great Impre&s;&s;ion upon
tho&s;e who wi&s;hed Mi&s;chief enough to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> till They &s;aw what Danger
might en&s;ue to them&s;elves by the Succe&s;s of the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and thereupon
wi&s;hed that They might break them&s;elves upon each other, without Ad|vantage
to either Party. And this general Di&s;temper and Complaint made
<MILESTONE N="40">the deeper Impre&s;&s;ion upon the King, by his di&s;cerning an extreme Diffi|culty,
if not an Impo&s;&s;ibility, to give any ju&s;t Remedy to it; and con&s;e|quently,
that He &s;hould be &s;hortly looked upon as a common Enemy.</P>
<P>HE had taken very great Pains, upon deliberate Con&s;ultations, to &s;up|pre&s;s
that odious Irregularity and de&s;tructive Licen&s;e that was practi&s;ed among&s;t
the Seamen, and had in many particular Ca&s;es him&s;elf examined the Exce&s;s,
and cau&s;ed exemplary Ju&s;tice to be done upon the Offenders, and Re&s;titu|tion
to be made of what had been taken, at lea&s;t of what was left; for no
Ju&s;tice could pre&s;erve the injured Per&s;ons from being Lo&s;ers, He had
granted &s;uch Rules and Privileges and Protection to the Ports in <HI>Flanders,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="50">and to others of his Allies, as them&s;elves de&s;ired, and looked upon as full
Security; but then He quickly found, that from tho&s;e very Ports and in
tho&s;e very Ships which enjoyed tho&s;e Privileges, the Trade of the <HI>Dutch</HI> was
driven on: So that it was evident that by that Liberty, which other Nations
<PB N="506" REF="512">
thought them&s;elves in Ju&s;tice entitled to, if not re&s;trained, the <HI>Hollanders</HI>
them&s;elves would be ea&s;ily able to carry on their whole Trade in the Ships
of <HI>Flanders, Hamburgh,</HI> and the other free Towns, or in their own Ships
owned by the other; and that the Re&s;traint would likewi&s;e be impo&s;&s;ible,
without a total Suppre&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e Men of War, and a Revocation of all
Commi&s;&s;ions granted to them or any of them, which would likewi&s;e be
attended with the Freedom and Security of Trade to all his Maje&s;ty's
Enemies.</P>
<P>IN the la&s;t Encounter at Sea, the <HI>Prince Royal,</HI> and three other of his
Maje&s;ty's Navy, had been lo&s;t; and another, the <HI>London,</HI> had been burned<MILESTONE N="10">
in the River by the Negligence of the Seamen; for there was never any Di&s;|covery
made, that there was any Purpo&s;e or Malice in it. The <HI>French</HI> had
obliged them&s;elves, that the Duke of <HI>Beaufort,</HI> Admiral of <HI>France,</HI> &s;hould,
with the whole Fleet under his Command, amounting to eighteen good Ships,
join with the <HI>Dutch;</HI> and the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> was likewi&s;e engaged to
&s;end all his great Ships, which were Ten or a Dozen, in Order to the like
Conjunction: So that it was evident to his Maje&s;ty, that the Enemy would
be much &s;uperiour to him in Strength and Power, though He had been
able to have manned and &s;et out all his Royal Navy; which He well fore|&s;aw
He &s;hould not be able to do, both for Want of Money and Want of<MILESTONE N="20">
Seamen, who were already in great Di&s;order and Mutiny for Want of their
Pay, of which there was indeed a great Arrear due to them. And, which was
wor&s;e, there was grown &s;uch an Animo&s;ity among&s;t the principal Officers of
the Fleet between them&s;elves, that the whole Di&s;cipline was corrupted; &s;o that
it was hard to re&s;olve into what Hands to put the Government thereof, if it
could have been made ready.</P>
<P>UPON which, and the whole State of Affairs, and upon Deliberation and
frequent Con&s;ultation with the principal Officers of the Sea, and &s;uch others
who&s;e Experience in &s;uch Matters rendered them mo&s;t capable to give Ad|vice,
the King found it mo&s;t coun&s;ellable to re&s;olve to make a defen&s;ive<MILESTONE N="30">
War the next Year, and to lay up all his great Ships, and to have &s;ome
Squadrons of the lighter Ve&s;&s;els to continue in &s;everal Quarters a&s;&s;igned to
them, which &s;hould be ready to take all Advantages which &s;hould be offer|ed;
and that there &s;hould be likewi&s;e ready in the River another good Squa|dron
of Ships again&s;t the End of the Summer, which being ready to join
with tho&s;e which lay out, when the Enemy was weary and their Ships &s;oul,
would be able to take many notable Advantages upon them; of which They
who advi&s;ed it were &s;o confident, that They did believe this defen&s;ive Way
thus ordered and pro&s;ecuted would prove a greater Damage to the Enemy
in their Trade, and all other Re&s;pects, than They had ever undergone.<MILESTONE N="40">
And in all this Coun&s;el and Re&s;olution the Chancellor had no other Part
than being pre&s;ent; and not under&s;tanding the Subject Matter of Debate
could not be able to an&s;wer any of the Rea&s;ons that had been alleged.</P>
<P>THESE Con&s;iderations, upon a full Survey of his ill Condition at Home
and abroad, induced the King to wi&s;h that there were a good End of the
War; of which Inclination his Maje&s;ty vouch&s;afed to inform the Chancellor,
well knowing that He would be very glad to contribute all He could to it,
as a Thing He de&s;ired mo&s;t in this World, and which He thought would
prove the greate&s;t Benefit to the King and Kingdom; and his Maje&s;ty like|wi&s;e
told him, &startq;that He found all tho&s;e, who had been mo&s;t forward and<MILESTONE N="50">
impatient to enter into this War, were now weary of it, and would be
glad of a Peace:&endq; So that there remained now Nothing to do, but for
his Maje&s;ty to advi&s;e with tho&s;e whom He thought fit (for there &s;eemed many
<PB N="507" REF="513">
Rea&s;ons to conceal both the Inclination to Peace, and the Re&s;olution not to
&s;et out a Summer Fleet, from being publickly known), what Method to ob|&s;erve,
and what Expedients to make U&s;e of, for the better procuring this wi&s;hed
for Peace, without appearing to be too &s;olicitous or importunate for it, or &s;o
weary of the War as in Truth He was. And to this Con&s;ultation the King
was plea&s;ed to call together with his Royal Brother, Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> the
Chancellor, the General, the Lord Trea&s;urer, and tho&s;e other honourable
Per&s;ons with whom He u&s;ed to advi&s;e in his mo&s;t &s;ecret and mo&s;t important
Affairs.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10">THAT which occurred fir&s;t to con&s;ider was, whether there were any Hope
to divide the <HI>French</HI> from the <HI>Dutch;</HI> upon which Suppo&s;ition the Pro&s;pect
was not unplea&s;ant, the War with one of them being hopefully enough to be
pur&s;ued; the Conjunction was only formidable. And to this Purpo&s;e &s;e|veral
Attempts had been made both in <HI>France</HI> and in <HI>Holland;</HI> Both Sides
being equally re&s;olved not to &s;eparate from each other, till a joint Peace
&s;hould be made with <HI>England,</HI> though They Both owned a Jealou&s;y of each
other: Tho&s;e of <HI>Holland</HI> having a terrible Apprehen&s;ion and Fore&s;ight of the
King of <HI>France's</HI> De&s;igns upon <HI>Flanders,</HI> which would make his Greatne&s;s
too near a Neighbour to their Territories; be&s;ides that the Logick of his De|mands
<MILESTONE N="20">upon the Devolution and Nullity of the Treaty upon the Marriage
was equally applicable to their whole Intere&s;t, as it was to their Demands
from the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> And <HI>France,</HI> upon all the Attacks They had made
both in <HI>France</HI> with the <HI>Dutch</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour there, and in <HI>Holland</HI> by their
own Amba&s;&s;adour, found clearly, that They were to expect no A&s;&s;i&s;tance from
the <HI>Dutch</HI> in their De&s;igns, and that at lea&s;t They wi&s;hed them ill Succe&s;s,
and would probably contribute to it upon the fir&s;t Occa&s;ion: And this made
them willing to put an End to their &s;o &s;trict Alliance, which was already
very chargeable to them, and not like to be attended with any notable Ad|vantage,
except in weakening an Ally from whom They might probably re|ceive
<MILESTONE N="30">much more Advantage.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, neither the one nor the other would be induced to enter into
any Treaty apart, though They Both &s;eemed willing and de&s;irous of a Peace;
in Order to which, the <HI>Dutch,</HI> through the <HI>Swedes</HI> Amba&s;&s;adours Hands,
had writ to the King, &startq;to offer a Treaty in any &s;uch neutral Place as his
Maje&s;ty &s;hould make Choice of;&endq; profe&s;&s;ing, &startq;that They &s;hould make
no Scruple of &s;ending their Amba&s;&s;adours directly to his Maje&s;ty, but that
their Conjunction with the other two Crowns, who required a neutral
Place, would not admit that Conde&s;cen&s;ion.&endq; And at the &s;ame Time
They intimated to the <HI>Swedes</HI> Amba&s;&s;adours, &startq;that the King of <HI>France</HI>
<MILESTONE N="40">would not &s;end his Amba&s;&s;adours into <HI>Flanders,</HI> or any Place of the King
of <HI>Spain's</HI> Dominions;&endq; and therefore wi&s;hed, &startq;that his Maje&s;ty would

under that Exception:&endq; All which Places, and in Truth any other out of
the King of <HI>Spain's</HI> Dominions, were at &s;uch a Di&s;tance (the Winter being
now near over), that there could be no rea&s;onable Expectation of the Fruit
of the Treaty in Time to prevent more Acts of Ho&s;tility.</P>
<P>How the Treaty came afterwards to be introduced by Overtures from
<HI>France,</HI> and what Preliminaries were fir&s;t propo&s;ed from thence by the Earl

&s;et forth in this Narrative before<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Page 400, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and Page 425, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>, that it needs not to be repeated
here. And one of the Amba&s;&s;adours repairing (as is there &s;aid) to the King,
and giving him an Account of all that had pa&s;&s;ed before any Thing was
concluded, and every Particular having been debated at the Council-Board
and con&s;ented to; He &s;aid, He could not under&s;tand how his Maje&s;ty could
be deluded or betrayed in that Treaty, which pa&s;&s;ed with &s;uch a full Exa|mination
and Di&s;qui&s;ition, and in all which Debates his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf had
taken the Pains to di&s;cour&s;e more, and to enlarge in the An&s;wer to all Ob|jections
which were fore&s;een, than He had been ever known to have done
upon any other Article.<MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>IT is very true, that the Chancellor had been commanded by the King to
write mo&s;t of the Letters which had been &s;ent to the Earl of <HI>St. Albans,</HI> from
the Time of his going over concerning the Treaty, his Lord&s;hip having like|wi&s;e
directed mo&s;t of his Letters to him; and mo&s;t of the Di&s;patches to the
Amba&s;&s;adours were likewi&s;e prepared by him, They being by their In&s;truc|tions
(without his De&s;ire or Privity) to tran&s;mit all Accounts to one of the
Secretaries or to him&s;elf. But, He &s;aid, it was as true, that He never received
a Letter from either of them, but it was read entirely, in his Maje&s;ty's
Pre&s;ence, to tho&s;e Lords of the Council who were a&s;&s;igned for that Service,
where Directions were given what An&s;wer &s;hould be returned; and He never<MILESTONE N="20">
did return any An&s;wer to either of them, without having fir&s;t read it to the
Council, or having fir&s;t &s;ent it to one of the Secretaries to be read to his
Maje&s;ty. And He did with a very good Con&s;cience prote&s;t to all the World,
that He never did the lea&s;t Thing, or give the lea&s;t Advice, relating to the
War or relating to the Peace, which He would not have done if He had
been to expire the next Minute, and to have given an Account thereof to
God Almighty.</P>
<P>AND as his Maje&s;ty prudently, piou&s;ly and pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired to put an
End to that War, &s;o no Man appeared more delighted with the Peace when
it was concluded, than his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf did; though (He &s;aid) as far as<MILESTONE N="30">
He could make any Judgment of publick Affairs, the Publication of that
Peace was attended with the mo&s;t univer&s;al Joy and Acclamation of the
whole Nation, that can be imagined. Nor is it ea&s;y to forget the general
Con&s;ternation that the City and People of all Conditions were in, when the
<HI>Dutch</HI> came into the River as high as <HI>Chatham;</HI> and when the Di&s;temper
in the Court it&s;elf was &s;o great, that many Per&s;ons of Quality and Title, in
the Galleries and Privy Lodgings, very indecently every Day vented their
Pa&s;&s;ions in bitter Execrations again&s;t tho&s;e who had fir&s;t coun&s;elled and
brought on the War, wi&s;hing that an End were put to it by any Peace;
&s;ome of which Per&s;ons, within very few Days after, as bitterly inveighed<MILESTONE N="40">
again&s;t the Peace it&s;elf, and again&s;t the Promoters of it. But, He &s;aid, He
was yet &s;o far from repenting or being a&s;hamed of the Part He had in it,
that He looked upon it as a great Honour, that the la&s;t Service He per|formed
for his Maje&s;ty was the &s;ealing the Proclamations, and other In&s;truc|tions
for the Conclu&s;ion and Perfection of that Peace, the Great Seal of <HI>Eng|land</HI>
being that very Day &s;ent for and taken from him.</P>
<Q>THE SEVENTEENTH and la&s;t Article was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;even|teenth Arti|cle.</NOTE> <HI>That He was a principal
Author of that fatal Coun&s;el of dividing the Fleet about</HI> June 1666.</Q>
<P>FOR An&s;wer to this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His An&s;wer.</NOTE> He &s;et down at large an Account of all the Agitation
that was in Council upon that Affair, and that the dividing and Separation of<MILESTONE N="50">
the Fleet at that Time was by the Election and Advice of the two Generals,
and not by the Order or Direction of the Council: All which hath been

Time<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 342, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> 1 &s;et down, and therefore needs not to be again in&s;erted.</P>
<P>HE took Notice of the Prejudice that might befall him, in the Opinion
of good Men, by his ab&s;enting him&s;elf, and thereby declining the full Exa|mination
and Trial which the publick Ju&s;tice would have allowed him;
which obliged him to &s;et down all the Particulars which pa&s;&s;ed from the
taking the Seal from him, the Me&s;&s;ages He had received by the Bi&s;hop of
<HI>Hereford,</HI> and finally the Advice and Command the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI>
brought him from the Duke of <HI>York</HI> with the Approbation of the King.
<MILESTONE N="10">Upon all which, and the great Di&s;temper that appeared in the two Hou&s;es
at that Time, and which was pacified upon his withdrawing, He did hope,
that all di&s;pa&s;&s;ioned Men would believe that He had not de&s;erted and be|trayed
his own Innocence; but on the Contrary, that He had complied with
that Obligation and Duty which He had always paid to his Maje&s;ty and to
his Service, in choo&s;ing at that Time to &s;acrifice his own Honour to the
lea&s;t Intimation of his Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure, and when the lea&s;t Inconvenience
might have befallen it by his Ob&s;tinacy, though in his own Defence: And
concluded, that though his Enemies, who had by all the evil Arts imaginable
contrived his De&s;truction, had yet the Power and the Credit to infu&s;e into his
<MILESTONE N="20">Maje&s;ty's Ears Stories of Words &s;poken and Things done by him, of all
which He was as innocent as He was at the Time of his Birth, and other
Jealou&s;ies of a Nature &s;o odious, that them&s;elves had not the Confidence
publickly to own; yet, He &s;aid, notwith&s;tanding all tho&s;e Di&s;advantages
for the pre&s;ent, He did not de&s;pair, but that his Maje&s;ty, in his Goodne&s;s
and Ju&s;tice, might in due Time di&s;cover the foul Artifices which had been
u&s;ed to gain Credit with him, and would reflect graciou&s;ly upon &s;ome poor
Services (how over-rewarded &s;oever) heretofore performed by him, the Me|mory
whereof would prevail with him to think, that the bani&s;hing him out
of his Country, and forcing him to &s;eek his Bread in foreign Parts at this
<MILESTONE N="30">Age, is a very &s;evere Judgment. However, He was confident that Po&s;terity
will clearly di&s;cern his Innocence and Integrity in all tho&s;e Particulars, which
have been as untruly as maliciou&s;ly laid to his Charge by Men who did
Nothing before, or have done any Thing &s;ince, that will make them be
thought to be wi&s;e or hone&s;t Men; and will believe his Misfortunes to have
been much greater than his Faults.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as He had dige&s;ted and tran&s;mitted this his An&s;wer and Vindi|cation
to his Children,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chancel|lor enjoys great Tranquillity of Mind in his Bani&s;hment.</NOTE> which He did in a &s;hort Time after his Arrival at
<HI>Montpelier,</HI> He appeared to all Men who conver&s;ed with him to be entirely
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o much Tranquillity of Mind, and &s;o unconcerned in all that
<MILESTONE N="40">had been done to him or &s;aid of him, that Men believed the Temper to be
affected with much Art; and that it could not be natural in a Man, who
was known to have &s;o great an Affection for his own Country, the Air and
Climate thereof; and to take &s;o much Delight and Plea&s;ure in his Relations,
from whom He was now bani&s;hed, and at &s;uch a Di&s;tance, that He could
not wi&s;h that They &s;hould undergo the Inconveniences in many Re&s;pects
which were like to attend their making him many Vi&s;its. But when there
was vi&s;ibly always in him &s;uch a Vivacity and Cheerfulne&s;s as could not be
counterfeited, that was not interrupted nor clouded upon &s;uch ill News as
came every Week out of <HI>England,</HI> of the Improvement of the Power and
<MILESTONE N="50">In&s;olence of his Enemies; all Men concluded, that He had Somewhat about
him above a good Con&s;titution, and pro&s;ecuted him with all the Offices of
Civility and Re&s;pect They could manife&s;t towards a Stranger.</P>
<P><PB N="510" REF="516">
THERE were two Inconveniences which He fore&s;aw might happen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Appre|hen&s;ions give him &s;ome Un|ea&s;ine&s;s.</NOTE> and
could not but di&s;compo&s;e the Serenity of his Mind. The fir&s;t, and that

as much Frugality as could be u&s;ed with any Decency, He fore&s;aw would
amount to a greater Proportion than He had propo&s;ed to him&s;elf. His In|di&s;po&s;ition

watching: So that to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Servants which He had brought with him,
which with a Cook, and a Maid to wa&s;h his Linen, amounted to &s;ix or &s;even,
He was compelled to take four or five <HI>French</HI> Servants for the Market and

<HI>Pi&s;toles.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">This &s;oon re|moved by his Confidence in the Piety of his Children.</NOTE> But all the Apprehen&s;ions of this Kind were upon &s;hort Reflec|tions

Children, who He believed out of his and their own E&s;tate would rai&s;e
enough for his unavoidable Di&s;bur&s;ements.</P>
<P>THE other Apprehen&s;ion &s;tuck clo&s;er to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. <HI>The Fear of being again per&s;ecuted a|broad.</HI></NOTE> and made him even trem|ble
in the very Reflection. He could not forget the Treatment He had be|tween
<HI>Calais</HI> and <HI>Roan,</HI> and the &s;trange violent Importunity that was u&s;ed
to him to get out of the Kingdom, when He had not Strength to get out
of his Bed. And though He was now at Ea&s;e from &s;uch inhuman Pre&s;&s;ures;
yet his Enemies, who had even extorted that Importunity from a People not<MILESTONE N="30">
inclined to &s;uch Incivilities, had &s;till the &s;ame Power, and the &s;ame Malice,
and a froppi&s;h Kind of In&s;olence, that delighted to deprive him of any Thing
that plea&s;ed him, and manife&s;tly plea&s;ed it&s;elf in vexing him. And if They
&s;hould again prevail with the &s;ame Mini&s;ters to remove him from his Quiet,
and oblige him to new Journies, the &s;ame Spirit would chace him from
Place to Place; there being none in View like to be &s;uperiour to their In|fluence,
when <HI>France</HI> had been &s;ubdued by it. So that be&s;ides the Impo&s;|&s;ibility
of pre&s;erving the Peace and Repo&s;e of his Mind in &s;o grievous a Fa|tigue,
and continual Torture of his Body, He &s;aw no Hope of Re&s;t but in
his Grave. And again&s;t this Kind of Tyranny He could by no rea&s;onable<MILESTONE N="40">
Di&s;cour&s;e with him&s;elf provide any Security, or Stock of Courage to &s;up|port
it.</P>
<P>HIS Friend the Abbot <HI>Mountague,</HI> who was the only Advocate He had
to that Court, u&s;ed all his powerful Rhetorick to allay tho&s;e Fears, and to
comfort him again&s;t tho&s;e melancholick Apprehen&s;ions, by a&s;&s;uring him,
&startq;that the Mini&s;ters were far from &s;uch Inclinations, and that Nothing but
Rea&s;on of State could di&s;po&s;e them to that Severity:&endq; Yet He prepared
him not to think of removing from <HI>Montpelier,</HI> without fir&s;t acquainting that
Court with it. And when afterwards He propo&s;ed to him, &startq;that He might
have Leave to re&s;ide in <HI>Orleans</HI> or &s;ome other City, at &s;uch a nearer Di&s;|tance<MILESTONE N="50">

whither They would not yet give him a Pa&s;s, till fir&s;t their Amba&s;&s;adour
<PB N="511" REF="517">

So that He found him&s;elf upon the Matter not only bani&s;hed from his
Country, but confined to <HI>Montpelier,</HI> without any A&s;&s;urance that He &s;hould
not be again &s;hortly bani&s;hed from thence.</P>
<P>HOWEVER after He had revolved all the Expedients that occurred to him
for the Prevention of &s;uch a Mi&s;chief,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This removed by an entire Re&s;ignation to Providence.</NOTE> He concluded there was no other Re|medy
to be applied to tho&s;e Contingencies, than in acquie&s;cing in the good
Plea&s;ure of God, and depending upon him to enable him to bear what no
Di&s;cretion or Fore&s;ight of his own could prevent. And in this Compo&s;ure
<MILESTONE N="10">of Mind He betook him&s;elf to his Books, and to the Entertainment and Ex|erci&s;e
of &s;uch Thoughts, as were mo&s;t like to divert him from others which
would be more unplea&s;ant.</P>
<P>GOD ble&s;&s;ed him very much in this Compo&s;ure and Retreat.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections on his unde&s;erved Treatment.</NOTE> And the
fir&s;t Con&s;olation He admini&s;tered to him&s;elf was, from the Reflection upon
the wonderful and unu&s;ual Proceedings and Pro&s;ecution that had been again&s;t
him, in another Kind of Manner, and after another Mea&s;ure, than u&s;ed to
be practi&s;ed by the mo&s;t bitter Enemies, and than was nece&s;&s;ary to their Ends
and Advantages who had contrived them: Not to mention the Malice and
Inju&s;tice of their fir&s;t De&s;ign of removing him from the Tru&s;t and Credit He
<MILESTONE N="20">had with the King, and to alienate his Maje&s;ty's Affection and Kindne&s;s from
him, to which the corrupt Hopes and Expectation of Benefit to them&s;elves
might incline them; and then &s;uch unrighteous Ends cannot naturally be
pro&s;ecuted but by as unrighteous Means. When They were not only privy
to but Contrivers of his E&s;cape, which They looked upon as attended with
more Benefit to them than his Impri&s;onment, or the taking his Life, could
have been; when They were &s;ecure of his Ab&s;ence, and of no more being
troubled or contradicted by him, by the Bill of Bani&s;hment, by which They
broke their Faith and Promi&s;es to the King, and made him depart from his
own Re&s;olutions: To what Purpo&s;e was all their other Pro&s;ecution of him
<MILESTONE N="30">both at Home and abroad, more derogatory to the King's Honour, and that
innate Goodne&s;s of Nature and Clemency that all Men know He abounds
in, than mi&s;chievous to him? Why mu&s;t He be ab&s;urdly charged with
Coun&s;els and Actions, of which He could never be &s;u&s;pected? And why
mu&s;t his Name be &s;truck out of all Books of Council, and Catalogues and
Li&s;ts of Servants, that it might not appear that He had ever been a Coun|&s;ellor
of State, or a Magi&s;trate of Ju&s;tice; a Method that was never prac|ti&s;ed
towards the greate&s;t Malefactor? To what worthy or nece&s;&s;ary End
could that exorbitant Demand be made and pur&s;ued in <HI>France,</HI> to expo&s;e
him and the Honour of that Crown to the general Reproach of all Men,
<MILESTONE N="40">with &s;uch unparallelled Circum&s;tances?</P>
<P>THESE very extraordinary Attempts and unheard of Devices &s;eemed to
all wi&s;e Men but the la&s;t Effort of vulgar-&s;pirited Per&s;ons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which rai&s;e his Confidence in God.</NOTE> and the faint

Inventions of very ill and &s;hort&s;ighted Men to triumph in the Ruin of an
hone&s;t Man, who&s;e Heart was always fixed upon his Protection, and whom
He had &s;o often pre&s;erved from more powerful Stratagems: And He did
really believe, that the divine Ju&s;tice would at &s;ome Time expo&s;e the Pride

not reflect upon any one Thing He had done (among&s;t many which He

which He was &s;o much a&s;hamed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And blames him&s;elf chiefly for his Ex|pen&s;e in Build|ing.</NOTE> as He was of the va&s;t Expence He had

his whole Affairs, and broken his E&s;tate. For all which He had no other

thereunto from the King him&s;elf, that his Maje&s;ty vouch&s;afed to appoint the
Place upon which it &s;hould &s;tand, and graciou&s;ly to be&s;tow the Inheritance
of the Land upon him after a &s;hort Term of Years, which He purcha&s;ed
from the pre&s;ent Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or: Which Approbation and Bounty of his Maje&s;ty

Part of what in Truth it afterwards amounted to, which He could without
eminent Inconvenience have di&s;bur&s;ed, involved him in that ra&s;h Enterpri&s;e,
that proved &s;o fatal and mi&s;chievous to him; not only in the Accumulation
of Envy and Prejudice that it brought upon him, but in the Entanglement
of a great Debt, that broke all his Mea&s;ures; and, under the Weight of his
&s;udden, unexpected Misfortune, made his Condition very unea&s;y, and near
in&s;upportable.</P>

He waited upon the King again. And the third was his la&s;t Rece&s;s, by the
Di&s;grace He underwent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great Be|nefits He re|ceived in them.</NOTE> and by the Act of Bani&s;hment. In which three
Acquie&s;cences, He had learned more, knew him&s;elf and other Men much
better, and &s;erved God and his Country with more Devotion, and He hoped
more effectually, than in all the other more active Part of his Life.</P>
<P>HE u&s;ed to &s;ay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A &s;ummary Recapitulation of his Life.</NOTE> that He &s;pent too much of his younger Years in Com|pany
<MILESTONE N="20">and Conver&s;ation, and too little with Books; which was in &s;ome De|gree
repaired, by the greate&s;t Part of his Conver&s;ation being with Per&s;ons of
very eminent Parts of Learning and Virtue, and never with Men of loo&s;e
and debauched Manners. And He took great Plea&s;ure frequently to re|member
and mention the Names of tho&s;e with whom He kept mo&s;t Com|pany,
when He fir&s;t entered into the World; many whereof lived to be
very eminent in Church and State: To who&s;e Information and Example,
and to the Affection, Awe and Reverence He had to their Per&s;ons, He did
acknowledge to owe all that was commendable in him. He did very much
affect to be loved and e&s;teemed among&s;t Men of good Name and Reputa|tion,
<MILESTONE N="30">which made him warily avoid the Company of loo&s;e and di&s;&s;olute
Men, and to pre&s;erve him&s;elf from any notable Scandal of any Kind, and
to live <HI>caut&egrave;,</HI> if not <HI>ca&s;t&egrave;.</HI> Nor was the Conver&s;ation He lived in liable
to any other Exception, than that it was with Men &s;uperiour to him in their
Quality and their Fortunes, which expo&s;ed him to greater Expen&s;e than his
Fortune would warrant: And yet it plea&s;ed God to pre&s;erve him from ever
undergoing any Reproach or Inconvenience.</P>
<P>HE accu&s;ed him&s;elf of entering too &s;oon out of a Life of Ea&s;e and Plea|&s;ure
and too much Idlene&s;s, into a Life of too much Bu&s;ine&s;s, that required
more Labour and Experience and Knowledge than He was &s;upplied for;
<MILESTONE N="40">for He put on his Gown as &s;oon as He was called to the Bar; and, by the
Countenance of Per&s;ons in Place and Authority, as &s;oon engaged him&s;elf in
the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Profe&s;&s;ion as He put on his Gown, and to that Degree
in Practice, that gave little Time for Study, that He had too much neg|lected
before; be&s;ides that He &s;till indulged to his beloved Conver&s;ation.
Few Years pa&s;&s;ed before the Troubles in <HI>Scotland</HI> appeared, and <HI>The little
Parliament</HI> was convened; which being di&s;&s;olved and pre&s;ently a new one
called, He was a Member in Both, and wholly gave him&s;elf up to the pub|lick
Affairs agitated there, and where He was enough e&s;teemed and employed,
till the Spirit reigned there, and drove Men of his Principles from thence.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50">HE was entirely and without Re&s;erve tru&s;ted, with two other of his
Friends, in all the King's Affairs which related to the Parliament, before the
Rebellion appeared; which brought him into Prejudice and Jealou&s;y with
many of Both Hou&s;es, who before were very kind to him. And in the Be|ginning
<PB N="514" REF="520">
of the Rebellion He was &s;worn of the Privy Council and made
Chancellor of the Exchequer: And from this Time the Pains He took,
and the great Fatigue He underwent, were notorious to all Men; in&s;omuch
as, the Refre&s;hment of Dinner excepted, for He never &s;upped, He had very
little of the Day, and not much of the Night, vacant from the mo&s;t im|portant
Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>WHEN the Prince was &s;eparated from his Father, the King commanded
him to attend his Highne&s;s into the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> under more than a common
Tru&s;t: And the Inequality of Humours among&s;t the Coun&s;ellors, the Wants
and Nece&s;&s;ities of the Prince his little Court and Family, the Want of<MILESTONE N="10">
Wi&s;dom in his Governour, that made him want that Re&s;pect from the Prince
and all other People that was due to him, the Faction among&s;t all the
Country Gentlemen, and above all, the ill Succe&s;s in the King's Affairs,
and the Prevalence of the Parliament in all Places, made the Province He
had very uncomfortable and unea&s;y. The unavoidable Nece&s;&s;ity of tran&s;|porting
the Per&s;on of the Prince out of the Kingdom (which was intru&s;ted
only to four of the Council by the King, and by his Command re&s;erved
from his Governour and another) when there &s;hould be apparent Danger of
his falling into the Hands of the Rebels, and the as nece&s;&s;ary deferring it
till that Danger was even in View, and the De&s;igns of &s;ome of the Prince his<MILESTONE N="20">
Servants with the County to ob&s;truct and prevent it when it was in View;
the executing it in a &s;ea&s;onable Article of Time before or in the Moment that
it was &s;u&s;pected, and di&s;gui&s;ing it by a Retreat to <HI>Scilly,</HI> and &s;taying there
till They could be provided for a farther Voyage; and then the Prince's Re|move
from thence to <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> the Conte&s;ts which happened there between
the Coun&s;ellors upon the Queen's Commands for his Highne&s;s's pre&s;ent Re|pair
into <HI>France,</HI> her Maje&s;ty's declared Di&s;plea&s;ure, and the per&s;onal Ani|mo&s;ities
which grew from thence between the Per&s;ons in the greate&s;t Tru&s;t;
were all Particulars of that Weight and Di&s;traction, that made great Im|pre&s;&s;ion
upon his Mind and Faculties, which needed much Reflection and<MILESTONE N="30">
Contemplation to compo&s;e them.</P>
<P>THIS fir&s;t Retreat gave him Opportunity and Lei&s;ure to call him&s;elf to
a &s;trict Account for what&s;oever He had done,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His fir&s;t Re|treat in the I&s;land of</HI> Jer|&s;ey.</NOTE> upon revolving of all his
particular Actions, and the Behaviour of other Men; and to compo&s;e tho&s;e
Affections and allay tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions, which, in the Warmth of perpetual
Actions and chafed by continual Contradictions, had Need of Re&s;t and
cool and deliberate Cogitations. He had now Time to mend his Under|&s;tanding,
and to correct the Defects and Infirmities of his Nature, by the
Ob&s;ervation of and Reflection upon the Grounds and Succe&s;&s;es of tho&s;e
Coun&s;els He had been privy to, upon the &s;everal Tempers and Di&s;tempers<MILESTONE N="40">
of Men employed both in the martial and civil Affairs of the greate&s;t Im|portance,
and upon the Experience He had and the Ob&s;ervation He had
made in the three or four la&s;t Years, where the Part He had acted him&s;elf
differed &s;o much from all the former Tran&s;actions and Commerce of his
Life.</P>
<P>HE had originally in his Nature &s;o great a Tenderne&s;s and Love towards
Mankind, that He did not only dete&s;t all calumniating and Detraction to|wards
the le&s;&s;ening the Credit or Parts or Reputation of any Man, but did
really believe that all Men were &s;uch as They &s;eemed or appeared to be;
that They had the &s;ame Ju&s;tice and Candour and Goodne&s;s in their Nature,<MILESTONE N="50">
that They profe&s;&s;ed to have; and thought no Men to be wicked and di&s;|hone&s;t
and corrupt, but tho&s;e who in their Manners and Lives gave un|que&s;tionable
Evidence of it; and even among&s;t tho&s;e He did think mo&s;t
<PB N="515" REF="521">
to err and do ami&s;s, rather out of Weakne&s;s and Ignorance, for Want of
Friends and good Coun&s;el, than out of the Malice and Wickedne&s;s of their
Natures.</P>
<P>BUT now, upon the Ob&s;ervation and Experience He had in the Parlia|ment
(and He believed He could have made the Di&s;covery no where el&s;e,
without Doubt not &s;o &s;oon), He reformed all tho&s;e Mi&s;takes, and mended
that Ea&s;ine&s;s of his Under&s;tanding. He had &s;een tho&s;e there, upon who&s;e
Ingenuity and Probity He would willingly have depo&s;ited all his Concern|ments
of this World, behave them&s;elves with that &s;ignal Uningenuity and
<MILESTONE N="10">Improbity that mu&s;t pull up all Confidence by the Roots; Men of the mo&s;t
un&s;u&s;pected Integrity, and of the greate&s;t Eminence for their Piety and De|votion,
mo&s;t indu&s;trious to impo&s;e upon and to cozen Men of weaker Parts
and Under&s;tanding, upon the Credit of their Sincerity, to concur with them
in mi&s;chievous Opinions, which They did not comprehend, and which
conduced to di&s;hone&s;t Actions They did not intend. He &s;aw the mo&s;t
bloody and inhuman Rebellion contrived by them who were generally
believed to be the mo&s;t &s;olicitous and zealous for the Peace and Pro&s;perity
of the Kingdom, with &s;uch Art and Subtilty, and &s;o great Pretences to
Religion, that it looked like Illnature to believe that &s;uch &s;anctified Per|&s;ons
<MILESTONE N="20">could entertain any but holy Purpo&s;es. In a Word, Religion was
made a Cloak to cover the mo&s;t impious De&s;igns; and Reputation of Ho|ne&s;ty,
a Stratagem to deceive and cheat others who had no Mind to be
wicked. The Court was as full of Murmuring, Ingratitude and Treachery,
and as willing and ready to rebel again&s;t the be&s;t and mo&s;t bountiful Ma&s;ter
in the World, as the Country and the City. A barbarous and bloody Fiercene&s;s
and Savagene&s;s had extingui&s;hed all Relations, hardened the Hearts and
Bowels of all Men; and an univer&s;al Malice and Animo&s;ity had even covered
the mo&s;t innocent and be&s;t-natured People and Nation upon the Earth.</P>
<P>THESE unavoidable Reflections fir&s;t made him di&s;cern, how weak and
<MILESTONE N="30">fooli&s;h all his former Imaginations had been, and how blind a Surveyor He
had been of the Inclinations and Affections of the Heart of Man; and it made
him likewi&s;e conclude from thence, how uncomfortable and vain the Depend|ance
mu&s;t be upon any Thing in this World, where what&s;oever is good and
de&s;irable <HI>&s;uddenly peri&s;heth,</HI> and Nothing is la&s;ting but <HI>the Folly and Wicked|ne&s;s
of the Inhabitants thereof.</HI> In this fir&s;t Vacation, He had Lei&s;ure to read
many learned and pious Books; and here He began to compo&s;e his MEDI|TATIONS
UPON THE PSALMS, by applying tho&s;e Devotions to the pre&s;ent
Afflictions and Calamities of his King and Country. He began now by
the e&s;pecial Encouragement of the King, who was then a Pri&s;oner in the
<MILESTONE N="40">Army, to write THE HISTORY OF THE LATE REBELLION AND CIVIL WARS,
and fini&s;hed the four fir&s;t Books thereof; and made an Entry upon &s;ome
Exerci&s;es of Devotion, which He lived to enlarge afterwards.</P>
<P>WHEN He had enjoyed, in that plea&s;ant I&s;land of <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> full two
Years, in as great Serenity of Mind as the Separation from Country, Wife
and Children can be imagined to admit, He received a Command from the
Queen, then at <HI>St. Germains,</HI> and an expre&s;s Order from the King, upon
which the other had been &s;ent, his Maje&s;ty being then Pri&s;oner in the I&s;le
of <HI>Wight,</HI> that He &s;hould forthwith attend the Per&s;on of the Prince of
<HI>Wales,</HI> who, upon the Revolt of the Ships under the Command of the
<MILESTONE N="50">Parliament in the <HI>Downs,</HI> and their Profe&s;&s;ion of Obedience to the King,
was advi&s;ed to make all po&s;&s;ible Ha&s;te to them; and the Chancellor was
required to wait upon his Highne&s;s at <HI>Roan</HI> upon a Day a&s;&s;igned, which
was pa&s;t before the Orders came to him.</P>
<P><PB N="516" REF="522">
AND then without any Delay He u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible Diligence to find the
Prince; who with greater Expedition, without coming to <HI>Roan,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed
to <HI>Calais,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Holland</HI> to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Ships which He found
there, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with all that Alacrity (which is always very loud) that
Seamen can expre&s;s; and by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> got
more Victual quickly on Board, that He might be in the <HI>Downs</HI> with the
Fleet to &s;econd &s;ome Attempt which was already on Foot in <HI>Kent,</HI> and
others expected in &s;everal Parts of the Kingdom. And the Chancellor
having in his Way called upon the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> at <HI>Roan,</HI> and together
with him, and &s;ome other Per&s;ons of Honour and Quality, made what
Ha&s;te They could to <HI>Dieppe,</HI> that They might there embark for any Place
where They &s;hould hear the Prince to be; there They were informed,
that his Highne&s;s was at the <HI>Brill</HI> in <HI>Holland.</HI> And thereupon They put
them&s;elves on Board a <HI>French</HI> Man of War, and upon the Sea were taken
Pri&s;oners by <HI>O&s;tenders,</HI> who, upon the Advantage of being in the Ship of
an Enemy, concluded them to be lawful Prize, and treated them accord|ingly,
with all the Circum&s;tances of Barbarity; and after having plundered
them thoroughly of Money and Jewels of great Value, and &s;tripped mo&s;t
of their Servants to their Shirts, They carried them in great Triumph to
<HI>O&s;tend;</HI> where though their Per&s;ons were u&s;ed with Civility and Re&s;pect,
and pre&s;ently &s;et at Liberty, yet They were compelled to &s;tay there many
Days, in Hope to obtain the Jewels and Money of which They had been
robbed, and, finding that not to be done (tho&s;e Privateers being &s;ubject to
no Di&s;cipline, nor regarding the Orders of the Admiralty, or any other Go|vernour),
to make &s;uch Provi&s;ion as was nece&s;&s;ary for a further Voyage.
And at la&s;t They got from <HI>O&s;tend</HI> to <HI>Flu&s;hing,</HI> having found Means to in|form
the Prince of their Mi&s;adventures, and of their Readine&s;s at <HI>Flu&s;hing</HI>
to receive and obey his Commands.</P>
<P>THE Fleet was then in the <HI>Downs</HI> in &s;o good a Po&s;ture, by the Acce&s;s
of other Ships and Ve&s;&s;els to it, and by &s;ome notable Commotions on Land,
that the Pro&s;pect was fair and hopeful. And the Prince received the Ad|verti&s;ement
no &s;ooner, than He was plea&s;ed to &s;end a Frigate to <HI>Flu&s;hing</HI>
for tho&s;e who had been &s;o long expected. But the Winds proved then &s;o
cro&s;s and tempe&s;tuous in the gentle&s;t Sea&s;on of the Year, that after &s;everal
Attempts at Sea, They were &s;o often driven back again into the Harbour,
&s;ometimes by very dangerous Storms, that in the End They received new
Directions to attend the Prince at the <HI>Hague,</HI> the Fleet being at the &s;ame
Time under Sail for that Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Lautherdale</HI> was at that Time come to the Fleet as Com|mi&s;&s;ioner
from the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to inform the Prince, that Duke
<HI>Hamilton</HI> with a powerful Army was already marched into <HI>England;</HI> and
thereupon to invite his Highne&s;s to make what Ha&s;te He could, to put
him&s;elf in the Head of that Army, according to a Promi&s;e the King had
made in &s;ome private Treaty with the <HI>Scots;</HI> and which the Queen had
&s;ent very po&s;itive Commands to be ob&s;erved and obeyed. This was the
Rea&s;on, not without other more rea&s;onable Motives, &s;o &s;uddenly to quit
the <HI>Downs,</HI> that He might get more Victual for the Fleet, and therewith
&s;ail to the <HI>North,</HI> and di&s;embark in &s;uch a Place as &s;hould be neare&s;t to the
<HI>Scots</HI> Army, with which He doubted not to find a very con&s;iderable Con|junction
of the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> &s;ince He knew that Sir <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> had
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with a Body of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Officers and Gentlemen, of <HI>Ber|wick,</HI>
and Sir <HI>Philip Mu&s;grave</HI> had done the &s;ame with the like A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance,
at <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> before the <HI>Scots</HI> began their March.</P>
<P><PB N="517" REF="523">
THE Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> and the Chancellor came to the <HI>Hague</HI> the next
Day after the Prince his Arrival, and were very graciou&s;ly received by his
Highne&s;s, and with a wonderful Kindne&s;s by all the Court, and all the
Gentlemen who had attended upon him; not &s;o much out of Affection to
them, as out of Dete&s;tation of one another, who had kept Company for
the Space of two Months la&s;t pa&s;t.</P>
<P>THE Prince had found the common Seamen full of &s;uch a keen Devotion
for his Service upon the true Principles of the Cau&s;e, and for the Redemp|tion
of the King his Father out of Pri&s;on, and &s;o full of Indignation again&s;t
<MILESTONE N="10">tho&s;e who had formerly mi&s;led them into Rebellion, e&s;pecially the <HI>Presby|terians;</HI>
that as They had before the Declaration &s;et all tho&s;e Officers on
Shore by Force, who were appointed by the Parliament to command them,
&s;o now They thought the new ones which They had cho&s;en for them&s;elves,
not fierce and re&s;olute enough for their Purpo&s;es. The Truth is; there had
been much un&s;kilful Tampering among&s;t them by Emi&s;&s;aries from <HI>Paris,</HI>
and other Attempts. And the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> having made his E&s;cape
very little Time before, and being then at the <HI>Hague</HI> when the Fleet came
to <HI>Helvoet&s;luys,</HI> upon the fir&s;t Notice lo&s;t no Time in making Ha&s;te to
them. It was generally known, that the King his Father had long de&s;igned
<MILESTONE N="20">to make him High Admiral of <HI>England;</HI> and the Commi&s;&s;ion which had
been formerly granted to the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> They all knew to be
repealed and cancelled: So that He no &s;ooner came to the Fleet, but He
was received with the u&s;ual Acclamations of Joy as their Admiral, and He
as cheerfully a&s;&s;umed the Command. And his &s;mall Family pre&s;ently be|gan
to propagate their &s;everal Factions and Animo&s;ities, with which They
abounded, to make &s;uch Parties among&s;t the Seamen as might advance
their &s;everal Pretences. And in this Po&s;ture the Prince found the Fleet
when He came to it, and re&s;olved to take the Command immediately into
his own Hand, and that the Duke &s;hould remain at the <HI>Hague</HI> with his Si&s;|ter,
<MILESTONE N="30">till that Expedition were over; and &s;o He made Ha&s;te with the Fleet
into the <HI>Downs,</HI> hoping that &s;ome pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion would be the be&s;t Ex|pedient
to extingui&s;h that Fire, and compo&s;e tho&s;e Di&s;tempers, which He
di&s;cerned already to be kindled among&s;t the Seamen.</P>
<P>THE Advice and In&s;truction which were brought from <HI>Paris</HI> were
grounded upon the Treaty with <HI>Scotland,</HI> the marching of that Army, and
the Expectation of &s;ome notable Attempt by the Pre&s;byterian Party in <HI>Lon|don;</HI>
in Order to which, all Addre&s;s was to be made to that City, and a
Declaration to be publi&s;hed to gratify that Party. This Secret was intru&s;ted
only to one of the Council, and one other who was to be mini&s;terial in
<MILESTONE N="40">what&s;oever the other directed. And this Temper was quickly di&s;covered
when They came into the <HI>Downs,</HI> by the great Care that was taken to give
no Offence or Interruption to the Trade of the City, which all Men be|lieved
would be the be&s;t Means to reduce it. Ships of Return, richly
laden, were &s;uffered quietly to pa&s;s thither; others coming from thence,
very well freighted, were likewi&s;e quietly permitted to pro&s;ecute their
Voyage: All which was pa&s;&s;ionately oppo&s;ed by Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> and all the
re&s;t of the Council. And this Contradiction was quickly known to the
Lords of the Bedchamber, and others, who had no Reverence for that
Council, and were now the more inflamed upon this Divi&s;ion of Opinion.
<MILESTONE N="50">And the Seamen likewi&s;e coming to take Notice of it cried out, &startq;the Prince
was betrayed;&endq; and grew into &s;uch Rage and Fury, that They declared,
&startq;that They would throw tho&s;e overboard who gave the Prince &s;uch evil
Coun&s;el.&endq; Two or three unpro&s;perous Attempts at Land, and then the
<PB N="518" REF="524">
Lord <HI>Lautherdale's</HI> coming thither, and the Order thereupon for the Fleet
to &s;ail pre&s;ently for <HI>Holland</HI> for the Rea&s;ons afore&s;aid, kindled all tho&s;e
Sparkles into a bright Flame of Di&s;&s;en&s;ion, &s;o univer&s;al, that there were
very few who &s;pake with any Civility of one another, or without the highe&s;t
Animo&s;ity that can be imagined.</P>
<P>THIS was the di&s;tracted Condition of Affairs when the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> and
the Chancellor came to the <HI>Hague;</HI> the Council divided between them&s;elves,
and more offended with the Court for Pre&s;umption in making them&s;elves of
the Council, and oppo&s;ing what&s;oever the other directed, by their private
Whi&s;pering to the Prince in Reproach of them, and their publick Murmurings
again&s;t their Per&s;ons for the Coun&s;el They gave, every Man endeavouring to in|cen&s;e
others again&s;t tho&s;e who were not affected by him; and this ill Humour
increa&s;ed by &s;uch an univer&s;al Poverty, that very few knew where to find a
Sub&s;i&s;tence for three Months to come, or how to di&s;po&s;e of them&s;elves. The
Clamour from the Fleet was &s;o high for new Victual and for Money, that
there was Apprehen&s;ion ju&s;t enough, that They would provide for them|&s;elves
by returning to their old Station; to which They had both Oppor|tunity
and Invitation, by the Parliament's having &s;et out another Fleet &s;upe|riour
in Power to them, that were already at Anchor in their View, under
the Command of the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> to block them up in that inconvenient
Harbour. The &s;udden News of the total Defeat of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army; and
&s;hortly after of the Lo&s;s of <HI>Colche&s;ter,</HI> and taking the Per&s;ons of &s;o many
gallant Gentlemen, and murdering &s;ome of them in cold Blood; the daily
warm Conte&s;ts in Council upon the in&s;olent Behaviour and the unrea&s;onable
Demands of the Lord <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> who as peremptorily in&s;i&s;ted upon the
Prince's going immediately with the Fleet into <HI>Scotland,</HI> as He had done
before the total Defeat of Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and without expecting to hear
what Alteration that fatal Change had produced in that Kingdom, which
was very rea&s;onable to apprehend, and in Truth had at that Time really fallen
out: The&s;e and many other ill Pre&s;ages made the Chancellor quickly find,
that in his two Years Repo&s;e in <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> He had not fortified him&s;elf enough
again&s;t future A&s;&s;aults, nor laid in Balla&s;t to be prepared to ride out the
Storms and Tempe&s;ts that He was like to be engaged in.</P>
<P>THE Pre&s;ervation of the Fleet was a Con&s;ideration that would bear no
Delay; and was in a &s;hort Time, though with infinite Difficulties and
Conte&s;ts full of Animo&s;ity, re&s;olved to be by committing the Charge of it
to Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> who was to carry it into <HI>Ireland,</HI> where were many good
Ports in his Maje&s;ty's Obedience. But that was no &s;ooner done, but the
horrid Murder of the King, and the formed Di&s;&s;olution of the Monarchy
there, and erecting and e&s;tabli&s;hing the Government in that Kingdom with
a &s;eeming general Con&s;ent, at lea&s;t without any vi&s;ible Appearance or Po&s;|&s;ibility
of Contradiction or Oppo&s;ition; the faint Proclamation of the pre&s;ent
King in <HI>Scotland,</HI> under the &s;ame Conditions which They would have im|po&s;ed,
and with all the Circum&s;tances with which They had pro&s;ecuted the
Rebellion again&s;t his Father; the Re&s;olution what was fit for the young King
to undertake in his own Per&s;on, and the di&s;mal Pro&s;pect, how all the neigh|bour
Princes were &s;olicitous not to pay him any &s;uch Civilities, as might en|courage
him to expect any Thing from them; were all Arguments of Per|plexity
and Con&s;ternation to all Men, who had been moderately ver&s;ed in
the Tran&s;action of Affairs; and were too many Things to be looked upon at
once, and yet could not be effectually looked upon but together. So that
the Chancellor u&s;ed to &s;ay, &startq;that all the Bu&s;ine&s;s He had been conver&s;ant
in, from the Beginning to his coming to the <HI>Hague,</HI> had not admini&s;tered
<PB N="519" REF="525">
Half the Difficulties and Di&s;con&s;olation, had not half &s;o much di&s;turbed
and di&s;tracted his Under&s;tanding, and broken his Mind, as the next &s;ix
Months from that Time had done.&endq; Nor could He &s;ee any Light before
him to pre&s;ent a Way to the King, by entering into which He might hope|fully
avoid the greate&s;t Mi&s;ery that ever Prince had been expo&s;ed to. His
own particular Condition (under &s;o general a Mortification) afflicted him
very little, having long compo&s;ed him&s;elf by a Re&s;olution, with God's Ble&s;&s;|ing,
to do his Duty without He&s;itation, and to leave all the re&s;t to the Di&s;|po&s;ition
of Providence.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10">WHEN the Fleet was committed to the Government of Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> to
embark for <HI>Ireland,</HI> it was enough fore&s;een by tho&s;e who fore&s;aw what na|turally
might fall out, that <HI>Ireland</HI> was probably like to be the Place whither
it might be the mo&s;t coun&s;ellable for the Prince him&s;elf to repair. But as
it was not then &s;ea&s;onable in many Re&s;pects to publi&s;h &s;uch an Imagina|tion;
&s;o it was not po&s;&s;ible to keep the Fleet where it then was, or in
any Port of the Dominions of <HI>Holland,</HI> where the <HI>States</HI> were already per|plexed
what An&s;wer They &s;hould return if the new Commonwealth &s;hould
demand the Ships, or whether They were not obliged to deliver them: And
therefore no Time was to be lo&s;t. Nor was the Voyage it&s;elf like to be &s;e|cure,
<MILESTONE N="20">but by the Benefit of the Winter Sea&s;on, and the unquiet Seas They
were to pa&s;s through; which would have made it too dangerous a Voyage
for the Per&s;on of the Prince, who mu&s;t find a &s;horter Pa&s;&s;age thither, when
it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>WHEN that inhuman Impiety was acted at <HI>London,</HI> and the young King
had in &s;ome Degree recovered his Spirits from the &s;udden A&s;toni&s;hment, and
had received the vile Proclamation and Propo&s;itions from <HI>Scotland,</HI> his Ma|je&s;ty
with tho&s;e few who were of neare&s;t Tru&s;t concluded, &startq;that it, would
be &s;hortly of Nece&s;&s;ity to tran&s;port him&s;elf into <HI>Ireland;</HI>&endq; which was to be
the highe&s;t Secret, that it might be equally un&s;u&s;pected in <HI>England</HI> and in
<HI><MILESTONE N="30">Scotland.</HI> &startq;That He &s;hould <HI>incognito,</HI> or with a light Train, pa&s;s through
<HI>France</HI> to <HI>Nants,</HI> or &s;ome other Port of <HI>Bretagne,</HI> where two or three
Ships of War, which He could not doubt of obtaining by the Favour of
his Brother the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> might attend him; and from thence He
might with lea&s;t Hazard embark for the neare&s;t Coa&s;t of <HI>Ireland,</HI> where
the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> might meet him.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS being concluded in that Manner, the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> went in a
Morning to the King before He was dre&s;&s;ed; and de&s;ired, &startq;that when He
was ready, He would give him a private Audience in his Clo&s;et.&endq; He
there told him, &startq;that his Maje&s;ty had taken the mo&s;t prudent Re&s;olution
<MILESTONE N="40">that his Condition would admit, for <HI>Ireland;</HI> where there remained yet
&s;ome Foundation for Hope. That for him&s;elf He was &s;o old and infirm&endq;
(for to his &s;eventy five Years, which was then his Age, He had frequent and
painful Vi&s;itations of the Gout and the Stone), &startq;that his Maje&s;ty could not
expect his per&s;onal Attendance in &s;o many Journies by Land as He mu&s;t
be expo&s;ed to: Yet having &s;erved the Crown throughout the Reign of his
Grandfather and his Father, He was very de&s;irous to fini&s;h his Life in his
Maje&s;ty's Service.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;THAT He had reflected upon the woful Condition his Affairs were
in, not more by the Power of his Rebels, than by being abandoned by all
<MILESTONE N="50">his neighbour Princes. That it was too apparent, that neither of them
would embark them&s;elves in his Quarrel; &s;o that the utmo&s;t He could
hope from them was, that in &s;ome &s;ecret Manner They might contribute
&s;uch a Supply and Relief to him, as might give him a Sub&s;i&s;tence, till
<PB N="520" REF="526">
&s;ome new Accidents and Alterations at Home or abroad might produce a
more &s;ea&s;onable Conjuncture. That even in that Particular, He doubted
the Magnanimity or Genero&s;ity of Princes would not be very con&s;picuous:
However it being all his pre&s;ent Dependance, He mu&s;t try all the Ways He
could to provoke them to that Di&s;po&s;ition.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;THAT He knew the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> was &s;o low at that Time, that
whatever their Inclinations might be, They could neither &s;upply him with
Ships or Men or Money towards the rai&s;ing or &s;upporting of an Army:
Yet that He knew too, that there is &s;uch a Proportion of Honour, and
of a generous Compa&s;&s;ion and Bounty, that is in&s;eparable from that Crown,
and even runs through that People, which other Nations are not in&s;pired
with. And He was confident, that if his Maje&s;ty &s;ent an Amba&s;&s;adour thither,
how nece&s;&s;itous &s;oever that Court might be, it would never refu&s;e to make
&s;uch an A&s;&s;ignment of Money to him as might, well hu&s;banded, provide
a decent Support for him in <HI>Ireland;</HI> where likewi&s;e the King of <HI>Spain</HI>
had Power to do his Maje&s;ty more Offices than any other Prince could
do, or He any where el&s;e, by the univer&s;al Influence He had upon the
<HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Nation. And General <HI>Owen O Neile,</HI> who was the only Man that
then ob&s;tructed the Union of that People in a Submi&s;&s;ion to the King, had
been bred up in the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> and had &s;pent all his Time in the
Service of that Crown, and had &s;till his &s;ole Dependance upon it; and
therefore it was to be pre&s;umed, that He might be induced by Direction
from <HI>Madrid,</HI> to conform him&s;elf to a Conjunction with the Marquis of
<HI>Ormond,</HI> the King's Lieutenant there.&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;that his Maje&s;ty knew
well that He had &s;pent a great Part of his Life in that Court, in the Ser|vice
of his Grandfather and Father; and He would be willing to end his
Days there, if it were thought of U&s;e to his Affairs.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Di&s;cour&s;e was too rea&s;onable not to make Impre&s;&s;ion upon the King;
which di&s;covering in his Countenance, the other de&s;ired him, &startq;that He
would think that Day upon all that He had &s;aid, without communicating
it to any Body, till the next Morning, when He would again wait on
him to know his Opinion upon the Whole; for if his Maje&s;ty &s;hould ap|prove
of what He propo&s;ed, He had another Particular to offer, before the
Matter &s;hould be publickly debated.&endq; When He came the next Morn|ing,
and found the King was much plea&s;ed with what He had before di&s;|cour&s;ed,
and a&s;ked what the other Particular was that He intended to offer;
the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> told him, &startq;that He was very glad his Maje&s;ty was &s;o
well plea&s;ed with what He had propo&s;ed, which He confe&s;&s;ed the more
He had revolved him&s;elf, the more hopeful the Succe&s;s appeared to him;
which made him the more &s;olicitous, that through any Inadvertency &s;uch
a De&s;ign might not mi&s;carry.&endq;</P>
<P>HE put him then in Mind again &startq;of his great Age, how unlike it was
that He &s;hould be able to hold out &s;uch a Journey, or, if He did, the Fa|tigue
thereof would probably ca&s;t him into a Fit of the Gout or the Stone,
or Both, which if He &s;hould outlive, He &s;hould be long detained from the
Pro&s;ecution of his Bu&s;ine&s;s, which the le&s;s vigorou&s;ly pur&s;ued would be more
ineffectual;&endq; and therefore propo&s;ed, &startq;that He might have a Companion
with him, of more Youth and a &s;tronger Con&s;titution, who would receive
&s;ome Benefit by the Information and Advice He &s;hould be able to give
him, the Advantage whereof would redound for the pre&s;ent, and might
more in the future, to the King's Service;&endq; and in Fine propo&s;ed, &startq;that
the Chancellor of the Exchequer might be joined in the Commi&s;&s;ion with
him, and accompany him into <HI>Spain,</HI> from whence if They made Ha&s;te
<PB N="521" REF="527">
in their Journey, They might make &s;uch a Progre&s;s in that Court, that
He might be able to attend his Maje&s;ty in <HI>Ireland</HI> in a very &s;hort Time
after his Arrival there; whil&s;t him&s;elf remained &s;till at <HI>Madrid,</HI> to pro&s;e|cute
all farther Opportunities to advance his Service.&endq;</P>
<P>THE King was &s;urpri&s;ed with the Overture; and a&s;ked, &startq;whether the
Chancellor would be willing to undertake the Employment, and whether
He had &s;poken with him of it.&endq; To which the other pre&s;ently replied,
that He knew not, nor had ever &s;poke to him of it, nor would do, till
his Maje&s;ty, if He liked it, &s;hould fir&s;t prepare him; for He knew well
<MILESTONE N="10">He would at fir&s;t be &s;tartled at it, and it may be might take it unkindly.
That He knew well how much of the Weight of his Bu&s;ine&s;s lay upon the
Chancellor's Shoulders, and in that Re&s;pect that many others would not
be willing He &s;hould be ab&s;ent: Yet that there was a long Vacation in
View, and there could be little to be done till the King &s;hould come into
<HI>Ireland;</HI> and by that Time He might be with him again, with &s;uch a
Return from <HI>Spain</HI> as might be welcome and convenient to him. And
therefore if his Maje&s;ty would fir&s;t break the Matter to him, He would
then take the Work upon him; and He believed He &s;hould give him &s;uch
Rea&s;ons, &s;ince He could not &s;u&s;pect his Friend&s;hip&endq; (which was very no|torious,
<MILESTONE N="20">and They lived then together), &startq;as would di&s;po&s;e him to the
Journey.&endq;</P>
<P>WHEN the King &s;pake to him of it, as a Thing that had re&s;ulted from
his own Thoughts; &startq;that He had more Hope to obtain &s;ome Supply from
<HI>Spain,</HI> than from any other Place; that no Man could be &s;o fit to &s;olicit it
as the Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> and Nobody &s;o fit to accompany him as He, who
might be with him in <HI>Ireland</HI> in a &s;hort Time;&endq; He &s;aid, &startq;He had
&s;poken with Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> to undertake the Employment, to which He
was not aver&s;e; but He had expre&s;&s;ly refu&s;ed to undertake it alone, and He
knew that no Companion would be &s;o acceptable to him as He would be.&endq;</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30">THE Chancellor did not at fir&s;t di&s;&s;emble the Apprehen&s;ion, that this
Device had been contrived at <HI>Paris,</HI> where He knew that neither of them
were acceptable, nor were wi&s;hed to be about the King, or to have &s;o much
Credit with him as They were Both thought to have: But the King quickly
expelled that Jealou&s;y. And He de&s;ired a &s;hort Time to con&s;ider of it;
and received &s;uch Rea&s;ons (be&s;ides Kindne&s;s in the Invitation) from the Lord
<HI>Cottington,</HI> that He did not &s;ubmit only to the King's Plea&s;ure, but very
willingly undertook the Employment: And, though it was afterwards de|layed
by the Importunity of many, and the Queen's own Advice, who
thought the Chancellor's Attendance about the Per&s;on of the King her Son
<MILESTONE N="40">to be more u&s;eful to his Service, than it was like to be in the other Climate,
the King was firm to his Purpo&s;e; and di&s;patched them &s;hortly after his
coming into <HI>France,</HI> when He re&s;olved and prepared for his own Expedi|tion
into <HI>Ireland,</HI> in Order to which there were then &s;ome <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships of
War that waited for him at <HI>St. Maloes.</HI></P>
<P>THIS was the Occa&s;ion and Ground of his &s;econd Retreat and Rece&s;s from
a very unea&s;y Condition,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His &s;econd Retreat in</HI> Spain.</NOTE> of which He was not more weary in Re&s;pect of the
Difficulty and Melancholy of the Bu&s;ine&s;s, from which He could not en|tirely
di&s;entangle him&s;elf by Ab&s;ence, than in Re&s;pect of the Company He
was to keep in the conducting it, who had Humours and Inclinations unea&s;y
<MILESTONE N="50">to him, irre&s;olute in them&s;elves, and contrary for the mo&s;t Part to his Judg|ment.
And He did &s;till acknowledge, that He did receive much Refre&s;h|ment
and Benefit by that Negotiation. For though the Employment proved
ineffectual to the Purpo&s;es for which it w&aacute;s intended, by the King's finding it
<PB N="522" REF="528">
nece&s;&s;ary to divert his intended Journey for <HI>Ireland,</HI> into that of <HI>Scotland;</HI>
yet He had Vacancy to recollect and compo&s;e his broken Thoughts; and
mended his Under&s;tanding, in the Ob&s;ervation and Experience of another
Kind of Negotiation than He had formerly been acquainted with, under
the A&s;&s;i&s;tance, Advice and Friend&s;hip of the mo&s;t able Per&s;on, and the be&s;t
acquainted with foreign Negotiations and the general Intere&s;ts of the &s;everal
Kings and States in <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> of any State&s;man then alive in <HI>Europe,</HI> and
who delighted in giving him all the Information He could. He was con|ver&s;ant
in a Court of another Nature and Humour, of another Kind of
Grandeur and Gravity, of another Con&s;titution and Policy; and where Am|ba&s;&s;adours
are more e&s;teemed and regarded, and live with more Conver&s;ation
and a better Intelligence among&s;t them&s;elves, than in any other Court in the
World.</P>
<P>THE le&s;s of Bu&s;ine&s;s He had, He was the more vacant to &s;tudy the Lan|guage
and the Manners and the Government of that Nation. He made a
Collection of and read many of the be&s;t Books which are extant in that Lan|guage,
e&s;pecially in the Hi&s;tories of their Civil and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical State. Upon
the reading the Pontifical Hi&s;tory written by <HI>Ille&s;cas</HI> in two Volumes, and
continued by one or two others in three other Volumes, He begun there fir&s;t
his ANIMADVERSIONS UPON THE SUPERIORITY AND SUPREMACY OF THE
POPE, which He afterwards continued to a perfect Work. Here He re&s;umed
the Continuation of his DEVOTIONS ON THE PSALMS, and other Di&s;cour&s;es
of Piety and Devotion, which He reviewed and enlarged in his later Times
of Lei&s;ure. Though He underwent in this Employment many Mortifica|tions
of &s;everal Kinds, yet He &s;till acknowledged that He learned much
during the Time of his being in <HI>Spain,</HI> from whence He returned a little
before the Battle of <HI>Worce&s;ter;</HI> and after the King's miraculous E&s;cape into
<HI>France,</HI> He quickly waited upon his Maje&s;ty, and was never &s;eparated from
his Per&s;on, till &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen Years after by his Bani&s;hment.</P>
<P>THIS He called his third and mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed Rece&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His third Re|treat after his Bani&s;hment.</NOTE> in which God vouch|&s;afed
to exerci&s;e many of his Mercies towards him. And though He entered
into it with many very di&s;con&s;olate Circum&s;tances; yet in a &s;hort Time,
upon the Recovery of a better State of Health, and being remitted into a
Po&s;ture of Ea&s;e and Quietne&s;s, and &s;ecure from the Power of his Enemies,
He recovered likewi&s;e a marvellous Tranquillity and Serenity of Mind, by
making a &s;trict Review and Recollection into all the Actions, all the Faults
and Follies, committed by him&s;elf and others in his la&s;t continued Fatigue
of &s;eventeen or eighteen Years; in which He had received very many &s;ignal
In&s;tances of God's Favour, and in which He had &s;o behaved him&s;elf, that
He had the good Opinion and Friend&s;hip of tho&s;e of the be&s;t Fame, Re|putation
and Intere&s;t, and was generally believed to have de&s;erved very well
of the King and Kingdom.</P>
<P>IN all this Retirement He was very &s;eldom vacant, and then only when
He was under &s;ome &s;harp Vi&s;itation of the Gout, from reading excellent
Books, or writing &s;ome Animadver&s;ions and Exercitations of his own, as
appears by the Papers and Notes which He left. He learned the <HI>Italian</HI> and
<HI>French</HI> Languages, in which He read many of the choice&s;t Books. Now
He fini&s;hed the Work which his Heart was mo&s;t &s;et upon, THE HISTORY
OF THE LATE CIVIL WARS AND TRANSACTIONS TO THE TIME OF THE
KING'S RETURN IN THE YEAR 1660; of which He gave the King Adver|ti&s;ement.
He fini&s;hed his REFLECTIONS AND DEVOTIONS UPON THE
PSALMS OF DAVID, which He dedicated to his Children; which was
ended at <HI>Montpelier</HI> before the Death of the Dutche&s;s. He wrote and
<PB N="523" REF="529">
fini&s;hed his ANSWER TO MR. HOBBES HIS LEVIATHAN, to which He prefixed
an Epi&s;tle dedicatory to the King, if his Maje&s;ty would permit it. He wrote
a good Volume of ESSAYS, DIVINE, MORAL, AND POLITICAL, to which
He was always adding. He prepared A DISCOURSE HISTORICAL OF THE
PRETENCE AND PRACTICE OF THE SUCCESSIVE POPES FROM THE BEGINNING
OF THAT JURISDICTION THEY ASSUME; in which He thought He had fully
vindicated the Power and Authority of Kings from that odious U&s;urpation.
He entered upon the forming A METHOD FOR THE BETTER DISPOSING THE
HISTORY OF ENGLAND, THAT IT MAY BE MORE PROFITABLY AND EXACTLY
<MILESTONE N="10">COMMUNICATED THAN IT HATH YET BEEN. He left &s;o many Papers of &s;e|veral
Kinds, and cut out &s;o many Pieces of Work, that a Man may con|clude,
that He never intended to be idle.</P>
<P>IN a Word, He did not only by all po&s;&s;ible Admini&s;trations &s;ubdue his
Affections and Pa&s;&s;ions, to make his Mind conformable to his pre&s;ent For|tune;
but did all He could to lay in a Stock of Patience and Provi&s;ion, that
might &s;upport him in any future Exigent or Calamity that might befall him:
Yet with a cheerful Expectation, that God would deliver him from that pow|erful
Combination which then oppre&s;&s;ed him.</P>
