<HEAD>A FRIENDLY REBUKE TO ONE Par&s;on BENJAMIN, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friend Benjamin,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_LET it not be thought that I come unto thee with Flat|teries and Fawnings, to &s;et forth thy Prai&s;es in Words of Vanity: But in Plainne&s;s and Verity I mu&s;t entertain &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e with thee in this publick Way, lea&s;t Men think thee to be that
<PB N="4" REF="3">
which thou art not, and lea&s;t thou learn to flatter thy &s;elf al&s;o with vain Imagina|tions.</P>
<P>I have not long ago ca&s;t my Eye upon &s;ome of thy Writings, for in truth, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> thou art &s;omething voluminous, and I mu&s;t not refrain from telling thee wherein thou art worthy of Blame.</P>
<P>Indeed it &s;eemeth unto me that thou ha&s;t fomented much Strife, even from the begin|ning, having &s;poken Words which have brought on thee the evil Will of thy Bre|thren, even of all thy Brethren; for I meet with none of tho&s;e Men who call them&s;elves Prie&s;ts of thy Church, but who, altho' they may &s;ay thou art on the right Side of the Que&s;tion, for &s;ome few are of that Opinion; yet &s;ay al&s;o, that thou ha&s;t been the Occa&s;ion of &s;o much Strife, and of &s;o much Scandal to good People, that it had been much better thou had'&s;t not &s;poken at all, but that thou had$&s;t altogether holden thy Peace even from the Beginning.</P>
<P>It is true, many of thy Savings are plea|&s;ing to us, and we find the Truth &s;peaketh &s;ometimes out of thy Mouth, in a manner, which it is plain thou do&s;t not fore&s;ee, no not thy &s;elf, in the greate&s;t of thy Humane Wi&s;dom; &s;eeing it is evident thou ha&s;t &s;poken tho&s;e things, which in their Nature over|throw
<PB N="5" REF="4">
the Con&s;titution of thy own build|ing up, and de&s;troy the Authority which at the &s;ame time thou ha&s;t exercis'd among Men.</P>
<P>If then thy Words and thy Actions thus contradict, and are incon&s;i&s;tent with each other, how is it that thou can'&s;t, with &s;o much Rancour and Gall, write a whole Book, containing more than three hundred Pages, to expo&s;e the Contradictions and Incon&s;i&s;ten|cies of others?</P>
<P>Can it be po&s;&s;ible, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> that if all the Gibeing Things which thou ha&s;t &s;aid in publick, in thy late Book, concerning the Man thou calle&s;t a DEAN, were &s;poken with Ju&s;tice and Truth? Nay, were much more of that Kind po&s;&s;ible to be &s;aid; yet can it be po&s;&s;ible that it can be more contra|dictory to it &s;elf, or more incon&s;i&s;tent than the Contradictions, which appear daily be|tween thy Profe&s;&s;ion, as a Man dignify'd a|mong Men, exalted in that Con&s;titution, which thou corruptly calle&s;t a Church, to that vain Title or Office which Men call a Superior, and the Arguments which thou u&s;e&s;t to prove that Church and that Office to be void and with|out Foundation, in the Word of the Lord?</P>
<P>Ha&s;t not thou, although a Churchman, exalt|ed above thy Brethren, vindicated and defended the Men who &s;ay openly; that &s;uch a Mini&s;ter
<PB N="6" REF="5">
as thou art, is an un&s;criptural Employment of Humane Invention, impo&s;ed upon the Faith|ful, neither of Divine Original, or ve&s;ted with Divine Authority? Nay, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> thou ha&s;t Even &s;aid, and in &s;o &s;aying, thou &s;aid'&s;t well, no doubt, that the Di&s;cipline belonging to the Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Con&s;titution, as it is &s;ettled by the Lay-Powers among us, is not a Chri&s;tian Di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>But how then come&s;t thou to put this <HI>Not Chri&s;tian Di&s;$ipline</HI> in Execution, by the Un|righteous Authority of thy Office and by the Ungodly Officers of thy Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Court?</P>
<P>Verily, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> thou oughte&s;t not to &s;ay further concerning any thing which the Man call'd a Dean has &s;aid ami&s;s, until thou ha&s;t reconciled this thy Doctrine with thy Practice, which I do not &s;ee thou art enclin'd in thy Heart to do.</P>
<P>It has been alledged again&s;t thee, that thou contende&s;t not in the&s;e Things for Re|ligion, but for Strife and Vain Glory, &s;ug|ge&s;ting to thy &s;elf Prai&s;e of Men, in that thou art eloquent, and ha&s;t the Gift of the <HI>Gob;</HI> &s;o Friends in the <HI>North</HI> of the&s;e Lands call a Man full of Words; and verily tho&s;e who &s;peak thus of thee, &s;eem to &s;avour of Know|ledge; fora&s;much as they give an Account, with much Laughter, how thou defende&s;t with Ob&s;tinancy the foul Cau&s;e of the Je&s;uit,
<PB N="7" REF="6">
&s;aid to be in thy Hou&s;e, who appears at length an Evil Per&s;on, not to be in any wi&s;e defended by ju&s;t Men, who are Lovers of Truth.</P>
<P>In Truth, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> thou ha&s;t lo&s;t much in the Favour of ju&s;t Men, by ob&s;tinately per|&s;i&s;ting in Vindication of that wicked Per&s;on, 'till thou wa&s;t put to Silence, and that with &s;ome Blu&s;hes, as Friends a&s;&s;ure me, by the po&s;itive Oath of his Oppo&s;er; and as thou allowe&s;t, That &s;uch <HI>an Oath of Confirmation is an End of all Strife;</HI> &s;o it &s;eem'd evident that the Affirming directly contrary to what thy Prie&s;t, nay, if I lye not, to what thy &s;elf had affirmed, has, de&s;ervedly, much le&s;&s;en'd thy Credit, not only in all that thou had'&s;t &s;aid before, but for all that thou can'&s;t &s;ay for ever hereafter.</P>
<P>Verily, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> thou ha&s;t &s;eem'd much to forget thy &s;elf, when thou undertake&s;t &s;o warm|ly to &s;earch the Truth and Con&s;i&s;tency of the Books of thy Antagoni&s;t, &s;eeing thou ha&s;t been &s;o openly detected of Incon&s;i&s;tency and Contradiction in the Ca&s;e above&s;aid.</P>
<P>Al&s;o it is remarkable, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> that there have been divers very unwarrantable Pra|ctices made u&s;e of to invalidate the Te&s;timony of thy Oppo&s;er; I wi&s;h thou may'&s;t be able to clear they &s;elf effectually of the Charge of being concern'd that way, when
<PB N="8" REF="7">
it &s;hall be brought to Enquiry, in a proper Place, and in a proper Way for thee to do it: I do not &s;ay I charge thee with this Crime, for I am not thy Accu&s;er; but there is One that accu&s;eth or excu&s;eth thee, that is thy own Con&s;cience. And thou know|e&s;t certainly and fully thy &s;elf, whether thou wa&s;t Concern'd or no in it. Be&s;ides, <HI>Benja|min,</HI> it is &s;aid among the People, that thou did&s;t lay the Foundations of &s;ome, no le&s;s Scandalous Accu&s;ations again&s;t One <HI>Mills</HI> of <HI>Croydon,</HI> in which he was fully acquitted, being heard by him thou calle&s;t Metropoli|tan, and who by thy own Law was the pro|per Judge of that Affair; neither do I hear that thou ha&s;t complain'd of any Inju&s;tice in his acquitting the &s;aid <HI>Mills</HI> of the Charge: Whether thou ha&s;t been an Accu&s;er of thy Brethren, yea or no, I do not averr; but it &s;eemeth &s;trange unto us who are Friends unto thy good Name, that thou &s;houlde&s;t let &s;uch Things as the&s;e remain doubtful, verily if thou art innocent, thou oughte&s;t to have declared thy Innocence; for I am a&s;&s;ured by the Friends of Truth, that the &s;aid <HI>Mills</HI> was very much wronged in that Accu&s;ation; and that he was not Guilty of the Things whereof he was accu&s;ed.</P>
<P>It &s;eemeth &s;trange to us <HI>Benjamin,</HI> I &s;ay to us, who are a People who &s;eek Peace,
<PB N="9" REF="8">
that thou, who pretende&s;t to be of a peace|able Di&s;po&s;ition, or at lea&s;t by thy Office oughte&s;t to be &s;uch, &s;hould thus <HI>delight in War;</HI> verily thou &s;eeme&s;t to be one of tho&s;e of whom the Word &s;aith that they are like the troubled Sea. The troubled Sea is indeed a Thing continually foaming and raging, ca&s;ting out filth and froth again&s;t the inof|fen&s;ive Shores without cea&s;ing, and which is wor&s;e, without Provocation and De&s;ign; but which is better, it is without Effect al&s;o, without Capacity of injuring or hurting the &s;aid Shore. But on the other hand, which I take to be much thy ca&s;e, the quiet Shore in a pa&s;&s;ive bearing the Da&s;hings of this Troubled Sea, and the raging of its Billows, frequently gains upon the Waters, which debil|litated and weaken'd by the expending their Strength to no purpo&s;e, are ob&s;erv'd to give back by &s;low degrees from the Land, and leave large Tracts of Ground bare, as a Tro|phy of Conque&s;t to the Victor.</P>
<P>I might now enquire of thee, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> if thou woul'd&s;t be mode&s;t and ju&s;t in thy An&s;wer, whether thou ha&s;t made up the Reckoning yet, between thee and thy Adver&s;aries, and whether thou can'&s;t tell me what thou ha&s;t gained by all the Clamour thou ha&s;t rai&s;ed among Men? I &s;ay, what thou ha&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="9">
gain'd, either to thy &s;elf, or to that Thing which thou calle&s;t Religion; or to that other Thing whereof thou &s;eeme&s;t to know but little, called a Church; or above all, to that le&s;s under&s;tood Thing, call'd the Kingdom of Chri&s;t. Verily, thou ha&s;t fought the Battles of the Lord with the Carnal Weapon, thy Pen, but ha&s;t brought neither Honour to thy Self, or addition to the intere&s;t of him who thou calle&s;t thy Ma&s;ter: for if, as thou &s;aye&s;t well, his Kingdom is not of this World, wherefore do'&s;t thou &s;eek to &s;upport it with worldly In&s;truments, and the Arts of thy fan|cy'd Rhetorick? Verily, Words avail nothing in this Quarrel, it mu&s;t be in the Sword of the Lord, not in the Sword of <HI>Gideon;</HI> it mu&s;t be the Power of the Spirit, not the Spi|rit of thy Power, which mu&s;t be exerted in maintaining this Kingdom, and this thou ha&s;t &s;aid thy &s;elf more than often times; why then doe&s;t thou go back from thy fir&s;t Principles, and Enter into a War with the Men of the World, in defence of that King|dom, and of that Authority which is not maintain'd by the&s;e Means?</P>
<P>In this, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> Methinks thou art in|con&s;i&s;tent with thy &s;elf, and falle&s;t into the &s;ame Self-Contradiction which thou Charge&s;t upon the Men who oppo&s;e thee; for verily this entring into Controver&s;y by writing
<PB N="11" REF="10">
again&s;t each other in Vindication, as thou calle&s;t it, of the Kingdom of Chri&s;t, is an Endeavour for the &s;upporting of that Kingdom by thy Agency, albeit at the &s;ame time thou alledg'&s;t that no Humane Power can claim any Right to interpo&s;e in the Government of that Kingdom, or can make any Pretence to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the maintaining it.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s Friend, if no Laws, no Con&s;ti|tions are concern'd to interpo&s;e in the Govern|ment of Chri&s;t's Kingdom, no Power is wanting to &s;upport or maintain it; but as Chri&s;t alone has the Right of Legi&s;la|ture, which thing I allow, &s;o he has Power &s;ufficient to Enforce his own Laws; and his Spirit is &s;ufficient to extend its Influence in the Hearts of his Subjects; to diffu&s;e the Know|ledge of his Will, and to produce an Uni|ver&s;al Obedience in his Subjects to tho&s;e his Laws if he thinks fit to have it &s;o.</P>
<P>Wherefore then doe&s;t thou officiou&s;ly take up the Weapons of Strife in a Quarrel of Peace? And wherefore doe&s;t thou lay about thee again&s;t thy Brethren? It booteth not one jot to the Kingdom of Je&s;us, which of ye have the Better, or which of ye &s;peak|eth mo&s;t Sen&s;e, or mo&s;t Non&s;ence.</P>
<P>And wherefore then ha&s;t thou thus brought upon thy &s;elf innumerable Enemies and Op|po&s;ers, and Men of Talents and Humane
<PB N="12" REF="11">
Learning to attack thee from every part? By whom thou art &s;ure to be wearied out at la&s;t, and in defending thy &s;elf again&s;t whom, thou ha&s;t even wearied the World with thy Writing. Surely <HI>Benjamin</HI> thou art Ignorant of the manner by which Men in the&s;e lat|ter Days judge of Matters in Controver&s;y, and how the way of the World now, is not for the People to judge of things by the force of the Rea&s;onings and worldly Argu|ments u&s;ed on either Side to Maintain or Defend their Po&s;itions; But Men judge now a-days by the Party which they E&s;pou&s;e, and by the Political Intere&s;ts which they have declar'd for before-hand; &s;o that the De|bate is not now upon the Weight of what this or that Man &s;ayeth in the Cau&s;e, but upon who the Man is, and who he is for, who &s;peaketh; and thus in every Que|&s;tion that is canvas'd by humane Art in the World, Men Determine which Man's Argu|mets they will approve and not approve, be|fore they hear what the &s;aid Per&s;on hath to &s;ay.</P>
<P>If thou can'&s;t fir&s;t Encounter with this new Method of Judging, and can'&s;t Purge Mens Minds from their Partiality, which I much doubt thou art not able to do, Then thou maye&s;t indeed Endeavour by thy Elo|quence, and by the &s;trength of thy quaint
<PB N="13" REF="12">
Phra&s;es, to in&s;inuate into their Under&s;tand|ings, and bring &s;ome of them over to thy Opinions: But it is to no Purpo&s;e for thee to go about to wa&s;h <HI>Ethiopians;</HI> thy Words make no Impre&s;&s;ions upon any but &s;uch as were before partial to thy Party, the re&s;t is all beating the Air, and only teazes the Multitude of thy Enemies, who will at la&s;t even &s;mo|ther thee with Words, and thou wilt ex|pire in thy own Way, <HI>viz.</HI> die in a Fit of Talk.</P>
<P>Thou ha&s;t indeed encumber'd thy &s;elf al|ready with a Load of Di&s;putes, too heavy for thy Potentials; and if thou can&s;t carry this Burthen to thy Journey's End, thou &s;halt always be e&s;teemed by me as a very good Ticket-Porter: But it is impo&s;&s;ible, <HI>Benja|min;</HI> and I mu&s;t &s;ay to thee, as one of thy Profane Poets &s;aid to another Voluminous Author, who in &s;pight of want of Sen&s;e, would be continually writing,</P>
<Q><L>Fellows who ne'er were heard or read of,</L>
<L>If thou writ'&s;t on, will write thy Head off.</L></Q>
<P>Be rea&s;oned with then, Friend <HI>Benjamin,</HI> and know the Extent of thy Talent; learn when to have done; take the Hint of <HI>Solo|mon,</HI> who was nigh-hand as wi&s;e as thy &s;elf; <HI>Be not wi&s;e over much; why &s;houlde&s;t thou die
<PB N="14" REF="13">
before thy Time?</HI> For if thou art certain to convince no Body, but tho&s;e who are of thy &s;ide already: Wherefore beate&s;t thou the Air? And wherefore is this tedious Conten|tion kept among Men, who not only are in the wrong on both Sides, but even are likely, by their Method, to be every Day more in the Wrong than before.</P>
<P>And to be plain with thee, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> this Strife among you Churchmen, as ye call your &s;elves, is the greate&s;t Ab&s;urdity, &s;peaking of you as Churchmen, that it is po&s;&s;ible for ye all to be guilty of: For what do ye in this but expo&s;e your &s;elves to us, who already believe you to be in the wrong, and confirm our &s;aid Belief, by your accu&s;ing one another of tho&s;e very Follies and Mi&s;takes, of which we did before accu&s;e and condemn you? And who&s;e Cau&s;e are ye all pleading but ours, who acknowledge not your Church or your Hie|rarchy in any Part of it?</P>
<P>Thy Oppo&s;ers &s;ay of thee, that thou art pleading the Cau&s;e of the Di&s;&s;enters, and we &s;ay &s;o al&s;o; verily in this thou art right, and pleade&s;t the Cau&s;e of Truth: And when thou &s;aye&s;t that <HI>a Man's being per&s;waded of Error in thy Church, is a &s;ufficient Authority for him to &s;eparate from it;</HI> thou &s;aye&s;t right; and this we have &s;aid al&s;o, even all of us who have &s;eparated from your Church <HI>(as</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="14">
<HI>you call it.)</HI> What then ha&s;t thou &s;aid for us more than we knew before, and more than we &s;aid loudly before for our &s;elves? Have we not often challeng'd the Sons of your Hierarchy to contradict it? Thou ha&s;t only confe&s;s'd that Truth for us which we in&s;i&s;ted upon before <HI>(viz.)</HI> that &s;ome of the Lay Con|&s;titutions of that which you call your Church, were Un&s;criptural, and a U&s;urpation up|on the Authority of Je&s;us. And tho' I own unto thee, that what thou &s;aye&s;t may be right, and all the Diffenters triumph in thy making the&s;e ju&s;t Conce&s;&s;ions; yet verily, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> I do not find that they accept of thy officious Zeal for their Cau&s;e, any otherwi&s;e than as the Te&s;timony of an Enemy, forced from him by the Power of Truth; at the &s;ame time declaring that this thy ju&s;t Acknowledg|ment is due to the Merit of their Cau&s;e, which obliges thee to confe&s;s that we are in the Right; and that, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> we have ob|tained a double Victory over thy People, by thy means: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> We have thee to prove that they are in the Wrong, that they are U&s;urpers of the Authority of King <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> that he has deputed no Power to them over the Con&s;ciences of Men, but that every Man has a Supremacy within him&s;elf to govern his Opinions, and is &s;ubject to none, and that a Per&s;wa&s;ion of Error in thy Church or
<PB N="16" REF="15">
Party, is a full and &s;ufficient Ju&s;tification to us, or to any one to &s;eparate from it. And, <HI>Secondly,</HI> We have the Te&s;timony of thy Practice again&s;t thy In&s;incerity; that where|as thou ha&s;t declar'd thy &s;elf per&s;waded of Error in the Con&s;titution of thy Hierar|chy, yet thou do'&s;t not &s;eparate from the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Thus, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> thou wilt be rejected by all &s;orts of Chri&s;tians, unle&s;s thou can'&s;t <HI>(which &s;ome &s;ay is thy De&s;ign)</HI> erect a New Sect or Party of thy own, and choo&s;ing thee out Di&s;ciples, who &s;hall be fully in&s;tructed in thy particular Opinion, &s;et up a Doctrine of thy own in&s;tituting, and obtain a Num|ber of Followers, as the Leaders in Error have always done; and this indeed &s;eems to be in thy Head, tho&s;e Words which I have ob&s;erv'd to drop from thee pretty often in thy Writings <HI>(viz.)</HI> MY Doctrine, MY Principles, My Opinion, and the like; inti|mating, <HI>as it would &s;eem,</HI> that thou art &s;et|ting up a Doctrine of thy OWN forming, and which perhaps thou would&s;t be willing &s;hould perpetuate thy Name to after Days. Well be it with thee, who can&s;t flatter thy &s;elf with a Fame built on the Broaching Error in the World; for Que&s;tionle&s;s, this mu&s;t be an Error which mu&s;t be built on a Scheme form'd by joining with that which
<PB N="17" REF="16">
thou declare&s;t ought to be &s;eparated from, at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>Verily, thy Followers mu&s;t retain this Prin|ciple, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that they &s;hall continue Mem|bers of that People, who they acknowledge to be in a Way of Error; and that they &s;hall &s;till be a Part of that Con&s;titution, which they confe&s;s to be an U&s;urpation upon the Authority of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and an Inva&s;ion of his Kingdom.</P>
<P>Fie, Fie, <HI>Benjamin!</HI> Either &s;eparate from them thy &s;elf, or thou wilt very ill ju&s;tify our Separation; it will be a mo&s;t de&s;perate Piece of Service for thee to engage in, at once to ju&s;tifie us that &s;eparate, and thy &s;elf who Conforme&s;t: As to our Separation, we need not thy help, nor can we accept of thy officious Di&s;puting for us, unle&s;s thou wilt likewi&s;e &s;hew thy Faith in thine own Argu|ments, by a con&s;cientious adhering to them in Practice: <HI>For Example,</HI> thou argue&s;t a|gain&s;t the Lawfulne&s;s of the <HI>Sacramental Te&s;t,</HI> as thou calle&s;t it, and well had'&s;t thou tim'd the U&s;e of tho&s;e Arguments; had any Act been depending for the Reforming that Im|po&s;ition, tho'therein thou can'&s;t have &s;aid no|thing, but what has been &s;aid before thee, by us, on frequent Occa&s;ions; but as I do not hear that any thing is now doing on that
<PB N="18" REF="17">
Subject, wherefore then ha&s;t thou &s;poken?</P>
<P>True it is, that it is a Blow to the Cau&s;e of Coertion, and of Impo&s;itions; that thou who art an exalted Member of that Hierar|chy, ha&s;t acknowledg'd the Inju&s;tice of tho&s;e Laws, and vindicated thereby <HI>Our Separation;</HI> but it is far from adding to thy &s;elf, that thou can'&s;t continue to wear the unhallowed Robes of that Authority, which thou &s;o Eminently condemne&s;t, and that altho' the U&s;urpations which thou complaine&s;t of are not depo&s;ed; and this is what I &s;o often, yea, again and again, call to thy Memory, for thy more mature Con&s;ideration: For art not thou one of tho&s;e Men, who ha&s;t taken on thee the prophane Office of a Go|vernor in that Hierarchy that has thus op|pre&s;t us, and which has thus invaded the Authority of King <HI>JES&V;S?</HI> Wherefore then can&s;t thou enter into an Enquiry after the Offence, which thou care&s;t not to amend? If it be true, that the Con&s;titution which thou &s;peake&s;t of, as E&s;tabli&s;hed by the Lay-Power is not needful to be &s;ubmitted to, but that every Man <HI>has a Supremacy within him|&s;elf,</HI> by which he is to judge; How then can&s;t thou maintain that Con&s;titution? Verily, thou ha&s;t taken upon thee a Task too great for thee to go thorow, more
<PB N="19" REF="18">
e&s;pecially to condemn the Legal Di&s;po&s;i|tions, and at the &s;ame Time to conform to them, and teach Men &s;o to do.</P>
<P>I think, Friend <HI>Benjamin,</HI> thou art not much unlike that Projecting Prie&s;t, who Men call Cardinal <HI>Alberoni,</HI> who, at the &s;ame time, that with great Accuracy, he has applied him&s;elf to &s;earch out the Imperfection of the Admini&s;tration in his own Country, as if he would amend the General Scheme of that ill Conduct, which had reduc'd the King|dom in which he lives, to all the Inconve|niencies, which for &s;ome Ages before it had labour'd under, has, in&s;tead of rectifying tho&s;e Abu&s;es, involv'd the Publick in Mi&s;|chiefs and Dangers, ten thou&s;and times greater than before, and which are mo&s;t likely to bring his whole Country to unavoidable Ruin: I think thy Ca&s;e much the &s;ame; For does not thy New Doctrine tend to de&s;troy entirely the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;h'd Con&s;titution of that Body which thou art a Member of, and thereby involve it in far greater Mi&s;chiefs than attended it before, notwith&s;tanding all the Mi&s;takes which thou complaine&s;t of?</P>
<P>How-be-it that thou thinke&s;t the &s;aid Con|&s;titution <HI>Erroneous,</HI> Coulde&s;t thou form no Principles upon which a Reformation of tho&s;e Abu&s;es are wrought, but thou mu&s;t take in hand to &s;upport us, <HI>who at the &s;ame
<PB N="20" REF="19">
time neithes ask'd or de&s;ir'd thy A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and perhaps needed it not, and indeed</HI> can not ac|cept of it, but upon the Terms of thy Sepa|ration from that Con&s;titution which thou &s;till adhere&s;t to?</P>
<P>But be&s;ides all this, Friend <HI>Benjamin,</HI> let us enquire of thee, to what End is what thou ha&s;t now advanced publi&s;hed to the World? And how doe&s;t thou make it corre&s;pond with thy Principles?</P>
<P>Thou ha&s;t publi&s;hed a Book, in which thou ha&s;t Cavill'd much, dwelt long on Trifles, Triumph'd much over thy Adver|&s;ary, on account of his having contradicted him&s;elf in &s;everal Things, which thou &s;aye&s;t he has written: But as I have &s;aid before, thou ha&s;t not, <HI>in my Opinion, Friend,</HI> con|&s;idered how much, and in what Particular thou ha&s;t contradicted thy &s;elf, and what manife&s;t Incon&s;i&s;tency there is between thy Words and thy Actions; take then thy own Likene&s;s, as &s;et forth in the&s;e Words.</P>
<P>Thou in&s;i&s;te&s;t much upon the Unrea&s;ona|blene&s;s of the <HI>Te&s;t Act,</HI> as e&s;pecially its being JUST upon the Papi&s;ts, as they are Enemies to the Civil Government, and UNJUST upon the Di&s;&s;enters, becau&s;e they are <HI>on the contrary,</HI> no Enemies to the Civil Government. But <HI>what is this to the Ca&s;e before thee?</HI> It is evident, as I &s;aid above, that the Parliament is not
<PB N="21" REF="20">
about to remove the Te&s;t Act at all; and all thou ha&s;t &s;aid of the Abu&s;e of Religion in continuing it is again&s;t thee. For if thy Church in&s;i&s;ts upon this Exclu&s;ive Law, and will not Repeal it, then is thy Church, as thou calle&s;t it, guilty, by thy own Confe&s;&s;ion, of maintaining <HI>an Error:</HI> And if thou art <HI>per&s;waded of an Error,</HI> in the Practice of thy Church, Why doe&s;t thou not &s;eparate from it, as thou maye&s;t ju&s;tify doing, even by thy <HI>own Doctrine.</HI></P>
<P>Verily, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> it &s;eemeth to me that thou doe&s;t believe, that as on the one hand a Chri&s;tian, <HI>when he is per&s;waded of an Error</HI> in any Con&s;tituted Church, may, on that Per|&s;wa&s;ion, ju&s;tifie his Separation from it: So on the other hand, thou allowe&s;t him to act which way he plea&s;es, and that he is at Li|berty to &s;eparate from Error, or not to &s;epa|rate, as he thinks meet; whereas I mu&s;t &s;peak to thee in Words of Plainne&s;s, he is not &s;o at Liberty to act; for that if a Chri|&s;tian is <HI>per&s;waded of Error,</HI> in a Con&s;titution, or Church, <HI>as thou calle&s;t it,</HI> of which he is a Member, and e&s;pecially when tho&s;e Errors are impo&s;ed upon him as Terms of Commu|nion, he not only may &s;eparate from &s;uch Communion; I &s;ay again, he not only MAY, <HI>but mu&s;t;</HI> he otherwi&s;e becomes guilty of that Error which he joins with: But how then
<PB N="22" REF="21">
can'&s;t thou retain all the Functions and Em|ployments which thou ha&s;t enjoy'd &s;o long time, and yet owne&s;t thy Church is e&s;tabli&s;h'd upon &s;uch per&s;ecuting, unju&s;t Laws, as are incon&s;i&s;tent with Chri&s;tianity; and owne&s;t that thy Church maintains a U&s;urpation on the Kingdom and Authority of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who alone is King and Soveraign in his Church; this, I &s;ay unto thee, is an a&s;to|ni&s;hing, &s;elf-contradicting Practice: And al|beit thy Argument were much better than it is in Favour of us who ye call Sectaries, thou art to us <HI>as a Sounding Bra&s;s, and a Tinkling Cimbal.</HI></P>
<P>And be not offended, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> that I liken thee to that Enflaming Prie&s;t in <HI>Spain;</HI> in Truth, he may on many accounts be excu&s;ed, for that he has embroild the State only, thou the Church: He has indeed brought War and Deva&s;tation again&s;t his Country from Abroad, but ha&s;t not thou &s;et peaceable People together by the Ears in thy own Country, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure been &s;aid to rai&s;e Civil War, or at lea&s;t Civil Feuds among thy Bre|thren? For to what el&s;e do thy Writings tend? And why ha&s;t thou deviated from thy more peaceable Employment of Preaching, to Printing Pamphlets again&s;t thy Brethren, in a Ca&s;e in which thou art &s;ure to rai&s;e much Strife, but not &s;ure to make one Convert?</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="22">
Furthermore, what ha&s;t thou gain'd by the Conte&s;t thou ha&s;t &s;o eagerly engaged in? Thinke&s;t thou that the Fame thou expecte&s;t will not ballance the Evil which thou ha&s;t brought upon thy People, in cau&s;ing them to contend in &s;o ungodly a Manner, break|ing all Charity and Neighbourhood, recrimi|nating upon, and reproaching one another; ripping up mutual Failings, and expo&s;ing each other in a &s;hamele&s;s Manner? Verily, it is an evil Thing that thou ha&s;t done, and I rebuke thee for the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing, that <HI>as thou vaunte&s;t thy &s;elf,</HI> thou had'&s;t obtain'd a Victory over &s;ome Par|&s;ons, frail and vain, like thy &s;elf, and a|bounding in Words; what Alteration art thou able to produce thereby, in the Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical Con&s;titution, which thou complaine&s;t of? Has any one Man chang'd his Judgment or Opinion by thy Writings? YEA, have not the HIGH among thy Brethren &s;trengthened them&s;elves, and hardned their Faces again&s;t thee by the&s;e things?</P>
<P>As for the Service thou ha&s;t done us, who di&s;&s;ent from thy Church, Verily, I &s;ee no|thing in it worth returning Thanks, or worth encouraging thee to go on with it; and why is it that thou expo&s;e&s;t thy Officious Zeal in a Ca&s;e in which we are not perhaps &s;o fully &s;atisfied of thy Sincerity as thou maye&s;t expect to find us?</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="23">
Were it not much better for thee to take up the Weapons of Truth again&s;t the raging Immoralities of the Times in which we live, and open thy Mouth again&s;t the Ungodly Encroachments which Vice has made upon the Fundamentals of Religion, and the de|bauch'd Principles of the Wicked and Pro|phane?</P>
<P>Verily, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> &s;preading the Cavils of &s;ubtile Men, difu&s;ing Error on one Side, and not fully confuting it on the other, is e&s;teem'd on all Sides injurious to Truth: For as much as that Error is generally more Vigorou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted on and defended, than Truth it &s;elf: Even thou thy &s;elf ha&s;t com|plain'd much of the Indu&s;try of thy Adver&s;a|ries, in their In&s;inuating into the Minds of the Ignorant People: And we cannot &s;ay for thee, that either thy Succe&s;s or thy Applica|tion have been Equal to it.</P>
<P>Nor has Truth generally obtain'd equal Succe&s;s with the Error it has oppo&s;ed, as is the Ca&s;e in thy pre&s;ent Undertaking; for as I have &s;aid, notwith&s;tanding all that thou ha&s;t done and written, and notwith&s;tanding all the boa&s;ted Succe&s;s of thy pre&s;ent Wri|tings, it does not appear unto me that either of the Hou&s;es of Parliament encline to take off the unlawful, unju&s;t Te&s;t, which thou ha&s;t &s;o much &s;poken again&s;t; and as for the
<PB N="25" REF="24">
greater Part of thy Fraternity, and Mem|bers of thy Church, they &s;eem to be more and more po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the Nece&s;&s;ity they have upon them to oppo&s;e the taking it off at all: Nay, they begin to rouze of them|&s;elves, <HI>as they &s;ay,</HI> the more to a&s;&s;ert the Right of Excluding a Di&s;&s;enter, by how much they pretend, &s;ome Fal&s;e Brethren among them, <HI>&s;uch as they perhaps e&s;teem thee to be,</HI> appear inclin'd to betray their Church and give it up.</P>
<P>Ha&s;t thou not then well employ'd thy talkative Talent in beating the Air, while thou ha&s;t rather indeed been beating the Alarm to thy Enemies, and awakning them to oppo&s;e thee, than per&s;wading them to come over to thy Opinion. Believe me, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> as I &s;aid to thee in the Begin|ning, the State of the Parties is much the &s;ame as it was when thou li&s;te&s;t thy &s;elf in this Quarrel; only that I may give thee my Opinion, many are gone off from thee, and the Number of thy Oppo&s;ers are en|crea&s;ed, rather than dimini&s;hed, &s;ince thou ha&s;t laid about thee, as thou ha&s;t done; and e&s;pecially &s;ince the filthy Story of thy Je&s;uit's Conduct has come upon the Stage, and his entring with thee into the Li&s;t again&s;t thy more Orthodox Brethren. Fie, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> how could'&s;t thou, who art, in
<PB N="26" REF="25">
thy own Opinion, &s;o able to maintain thy Points again&s;t all thy Oppo&s;ers; I &s;ay, how coulde&s;t thou join &s;uch a pitiful Auxil|liar to thy Party, &s;uffering a Renegade of <HI>Rome</HI> to in&s;ult thy Brethren? For, Verily, the Man over and above his want of Prin|ciples, is greatly deficient of that which thou pretende&s;t much to, I mean Decency, being altogether as void of Manners, as they &s;ay he is void of Truth; and which is much more to his Shame to &s;peak, he is &s;aid to be as void of Truth as of Manners.</P>
<P>It is true, thou maye&s;t &s;mile at a Charge of this Nature, coming from one whom ye think decrys the thing thou calle&s;t Man|ners; but thou art therein greatly deficient in thy Knowledge of us, and of our Ways: For albeit, Friends do not give worldly Homage, after the Manner of Men, yet we do not u&s;e the Men which we &s;o decline to honour, with un&s;eemly Words, and rude of|fen&s;ive breaking forth of Words, fora&s;much as we do by all Men, as we would that they &s;hould do unto us.</P>
<P>But thou knowe&s;t well that this thy Je|&s;uit, as they call him, hath with Rudene&s;s and filthy Words, a&s;&s;aulted tho&s;e who he has fallen on in thy Defence: So that the Sons of <HI>Belial</HI> have rejoyc'd over thee, and have &s;aid, that thou ha&s;t employ'd him to
<PB N="27" REF="26">
do that dirty Work which thou cared'&s;t not to do for thy &s;elf; or which to &s;peak plain|ly, thou wa&s;t a&s;ham'd to do for thy &s;elf.</P>
<P>And now he is put to Silence, and thou al&s;o ha&s;t, for &s;ome time, been put to Silence on his Behalf, and to wipe out the Remem|brance of tho&s;e things, whereof they are a&s;hamed, thou ha&s;t called another Cau&s;e, as the prophane Men &s;peak, and ha&s;t &s;et on Foot an ancient Di&s;pute concerning <HI>Te&s;ts, Occa&s;ion-Communion, Schi&s;m-Acts,</HI> and the like; for which, in my Judgment, <HI>Ben|jamin,</HI> the Di&s;&s;enters have little Rea&s;on to acknowledge thy Services. For be it &s;o, &s;ome of tho&s;e Laws which have for &s;ome time oppre&s;s'd us, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the Schi&s;m-Act, and Occa&s;ional-Act, whereby we are not permitted the in&s;tructing our own Children; and tho&s;e of the Di&s;&s;enters, who &s;eek Men acquainted with the Learning of the Hea|then to be their In&s;tructors, are not allowed Schools to in&s;truct them in the &s;aid Learn|ing. I &s;ay, albeit the&s;e Acts are now in a fair Way to be repealed by the Rulers of thy People, yet I do not &s;ee that any thing &s;aid by thee can have contributed to that, which Ju&s;tice hath moved our Rulers to do.</P>
<P>But were it true, I do not yet &s;ee al&s;o wherein the Di&s;&s;enters &s;hall be bettered by that Matter, &s;eeing it opens a Door to that
<PB N="28" REF="27">
ungodly Practice of joyning with one Sort to Day, and with another to Marrow; with one Side for pretended Con&s;cience, and with the other for Wordly Enjoy|ment and Advantage; which Practice I hold to be not only Vile and Hypocritical in it &s;elf, and to have a Tendency to de|&s;troy true Sincerity, but al&s;o I hold it to be de&s;tructive to the Di&s;&s;enters them&s;elves in this Nation, to the Worldly Intere&s;t, as a Party, and to their good Name among Men; and which will, in the End, carry them all, or at lea&s;t all their Po&s;terity over to thy Church And be it known to thee, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> whether thou wilt acknowledge it or not, I cannot tell, but I take this to be thy De&s;ign; and that thou art only de|&s;igning to obtain this Liberty for the Di&s;|&s;enters, to do Evil, that thou maye&s;t de&s;troy them, and lay a Snare for them. Nor is it my Opinion only, that this Liberty will de|&s;toy them, but it has been the Opinion of thy Brethren, particularly the Arch-Prelate o$ <HI>Lambeth,</HI> la&s;t decea&s;ed, and the Prelate <HI>Gillert,</HI> of who&s;e Fame thou ha&s;t heard; who &s;aid, as I am informed, by the Men of Truth in the A&s;&s;embly of the Princes of thy People, that the Di&s;&s;enters had lo&s;t more Ground by their Tolerating them in Occa|&s;ional-Communion, than ever they had lo&s;t
<PB N="29" REF="28">
by all the Per&s;ecuting Laws they had been vexed withal in this Land.</P>
<P>If this then be true of thee, that thou, with thy Brethren, ha&s;t an evil Eye upon us Di&s;&s;enters in this Good which is now coming upon us, what have we to thank thee in therefore? Verily, thou wilt be to us as one of the Sons of <HI>Belial,</HI> who &s;pake Peace, but &s;eeks to de&s;troy it, and &s;ay a Con|federacy, when they are to us as utter Ene|mies, and as fal&s;e Brethren.</P>
<P>Thou maye&s;t even then cea&s;e from us, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> as to the&s;e things, unle&s;s thou wilt, with Hone&s;ty and Sincerity, come over to us, as Truth and thy own Con&s;ci|ence, I que&s;tion not, per&s;wades thee thou oughte&s;t to do. For, Verily, while thou keepe&s;t thy Seat with the Scorners, and walke&s;t in the Congregation of the Ungod|ly, what Weight can be given to the Words which thou &s;halt &s;peak in our Be|half?</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> with putting thee in mind of one thing, which &s;ome &s;ay thou pride&s;t thy &s;elf in, and this is, that thou thinke&s;t thou plea&s;e&s;t in tho&s;e things, &s;ome great Men and Men in Power, and per|haps the greate&s;t Man, and that in time thou maye&s;t meet with thy Reward on that Score. I &s;hall &s;ay very little to this, only to let thee
<PB N="30" REF="29">
know I have, and Friends have as much Re|&s;pect for the King of tho&s;e Lands as thou can'&s;t have; but whatever thou believe&s;t of thy &s;elf, I cannot believe &s;o unworthily of Our Lord the King, as to think he does, or will, take Plea&s;ure in tho&s;e things which do not tend to the Peace and Tranquility of the People of his Land.</P>
<P>And howbe&s;t this may be Truth, that the King doeth not hear, and is not inform|ed of all the Sayings and Writings in the&s;e Di&s;putes: Verily, the King has things of much more Moment to engage his Thoughts about; yet if he &s;hould be at any time in|formed of thy Doings in this Matter, I be|lieve he would be ill plea&s;ed therewith, be|cau&s;e I believe the King de&s;ireth unfeigned|ly, the Things which belong to our Peace.</P>
<P>Neither is it one of the lea&s;t of the Er|rors of thy Ways, that thou ha&s;t endea|voured (as Men &s;ay of thee) to &s;helter thy weak Arguments under this Cover <HI>(viz.)</HI> that many of thy Oppo&s;ers are Enemies unto the King; but this doeth not give thee ju&s;t Cau&s;e to &s;ugge&s;t, that oppo&s;ing thee denominates any Man to be an Enemy unto the King. Verily, there are tho&s;e who &s;in|cerely love <HI>GEORGE</HI> our King, and faith|fully adhere unto his Intere&s;t, but yet can|not join with thee in any of the&s;e Things,
<PB N="31" REF="30">
neither can entertain the &s;ame Thoughts with thee of thy &s;elf: But &s;u&s;pect thy Pride, and the Naughtine&s;s of thy Heart, by how much thou pu&s;he&s;t forward the Strife of which thou can'&s;t never expect any I&s;&s;ue, but &s;uch as wi&s;e Men de&s;pi&s;e; I mean the expo&s;ing the Infirmities of others, in which it may fall out, &s;ome may think thou likewi&s;e expo&s;e&s;t thy own.</P>
<P>And wherefore doe&s;t thou &s;et thy &s;elf to oppo&s;e the known Law, which is the Opinion of thy Brethren is a Security to thy own Church? Thinke&s;t thou that it is lawful for thee to arraign the Laws of the Land, and to &s;ay they are Ungodly and Unju&s;t? Verily, this would be called in us mean, even a Crime to be puni&s;hed by the Judge: But thou doe&s;t this with Impunity, and &s;eeme&s;t in a commanding Voice to claim that &s;uch Laws &s;hould be abrogated and di&s;anull'd. But knowe&s;t thou they &s;elf to be &s;ubject unto the Laws; and do not we, <HI>even we,</HI> Friend <HI>Benjamin,</HI> &s;ubmit to the Laws which we do not ap|prove? Where then is the Principle of Obedience to the Higher Powers, which thou ha&s;t &s;poken &s;o much about in former Days?</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="31">
I wi&s;h thou woulde&s;t acquaint us in Plain|ne&s;s and Soberne&s;s, what the <HI>Mea&s;ures of Submi&s;&s;ion</HI> are in the Ca&s;e of this Law; and take Care, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> that tho&s;e Mea&s;ures &s;uit well with what thou had'&s;t dictated to the Di&s;&s;enters in former Times; for, Verily, I fear thou ha&s;t not corre&s;ponded with thy &s;elf in that Affair.</P>
