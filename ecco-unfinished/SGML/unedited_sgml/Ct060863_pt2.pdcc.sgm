<DIV3>
<HEAD>RICHARD I. A. D. 1189</HEAD>
<P>RICHARD &s;ucceeded to his father's throne without oppo&s;ition, and in the fir&s;t a&s;&s;embly of his prelates and nobility, after his coro|nation, he filled up the vacant &s;ees of London, Winche&s;ter, Sarum, and Ely; and deliberated upon mea&s;ures for enabling him to equip a powerful ar|mament again&s;t the infidels, who had over-run the Holy Land. The King &s;eized the effects of the late bi&s;hop of Ely, to a con&s;iderable value; which he had found in his father's trea&s;ury, at Winche&s;ter, gold, and &s;ilver, and jewels, to the amount of nine hundred thou&s;and pounds. But even this va&s;t &s;um was in&s;ufficient for his intended expedition to the Holy Land. He therefore &s;old the earldom of Northumber|land,
<PB N="2" REF="3">and the honour of Sudberg. He &s;et up for &s;ale the offices of high-&s;heriff, keepers of fore&s;ts, and many other lucrative po&s;ts and dignities; liberties, charters, ca&s;tles, and manors of the crown, were given to the highe&s;t bidders; and when &s;ome of his friends remon&s;trated to him the ill con&s;equence of &s;uch aliena|tion, he told them he would &s;ell the city of London if he could find a purcha&s;er.</P>
<P>When the King had prepared for his expedition, he received the &s;crip and &s;taff from the archbi&s;hop of Tours, and marched to Vazelay, where he was joined by the King of France, and they proceeded to Me&s;&s;i|na, and from thence for the Holy Land. But he was not &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in his expedition as his flattery had &s;ugge&s;ted; and he was taken pri&s;oner, and obliged to purcha&s;e his ran&s;om. Neverthele&s;s, upon his return to London, &s;uch was the infatuation of the people, that they received him with great marks of e&s;teem, which &s;oon after he ungratefully requited by the impo|&s;itions of taxes too grievous to be borne.</P>
<P>But as the reign of this prince was apparently taken up in his infatuated attachment to the &s;uper&s;titious doc|trines and practices of the &s;ee of Rome, he had little lei&s;ure or inclination to con&s;ult the happine&s;s of his &s;ub|jects, or pur&s;ue mea&s;ures conducive to liberty and true religion; and therefore gave room for the introduction of a variety of impo&s;itions on the rights of Britain, as the Pope and his legates thought fit.</P>
<P>As Richard was the fir&s;t of the Engli&s;h Kings who bore arms on his &s;eals, &s;o he was the fir&s;t who carried in his &s;hield three lions pa&s;&s;ant, borne ever after for the regal arms of England.</P>
<P>As to his character, his &s;trict attention to public wor&s;hip, and his alms to the poor, and his gifts to tho&s;e churches and mona&s;teries which he had before robbed for his purpo&s;es, are the mo&s;t &s;hining parts of his reign. For his ingratitude, and want of filial affection, are unpardonable: he was proud,
<PB N="3" REF="4">haughty, ambitious, choleric, cruel, vindictive, and licentious: a tyrant to his wife, as well as to his &s;ub|jects, who groaned under his taxations to &s;uch a high degree, that his few virtues could not pre&s;erve him from contempt.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>JOHN, A. D. 1199.</HEAD>
<P>JOHN, &s;urnamed Sans-Terre or Lackland, upon the demi&s;e of Richard I. &s;ucceeded to the crown of England, though in prejudice to Arthur, who had an hereditary right; but as hereditary right had been &s;o often &s;et a&s;ide, both under the Saxon and Norman governments, it made no great di&s;turbance in Eng|land; and John who was at that time abroad on the continent, upon receiving intelligence of his de&s;igna|tion to the crown, returned to England, and landing at New Shoreham proceeded directly to London; next day, June 9, he was crowned at We&s;tmin&s;ter by Hubert archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, in a full a&s;&s;embly of the pre|lates, earls and barons, after the King had taken the oaths to maintain the peace of the church, and the people, to re&s;train rapine and other iniquities, and to be governed by equity and mercy in all his deci&s;ions. The Pope's legate, who then re&s;ided in England, brought about a peace between the Kings of France and England, which had commenced in the reign of King Richard. In con&s;equence of this treaty, by which John reaped no advantage, but Philip's promi&s;e of abandoning the intere&s;t of Arthur; whereupon Arthur, to adju&s;t matters with his brother, did him homage for Brittany.</P>
<P>During the expedition of King John, he was cap|tivated with the beauty of I&s;abel, daughter of the King of Portugal, who, from the &s;udden impul&s;e of his own unruly pa&s;&s;ion, thereupon re&s;olved to de|mand her in marriage; notwith&s;tanding it was an act of inju&s;tice, as &s;he was then affianced to Hugh le Brun, Count of la Marche; accordingly he premeditated a
<PB N="4" REF="5">divorce from his wife, and in &s;pight of all his ob&s;truc|tions was immediately divorced by his own ab&s;olute command, this rea&s;on only being a&s;&s;igned, that &s;he proved barren; his marriage with I&s;abel was then con|&s;ummated, and &s;he was afterwards crowned. The di&s;appointed lover then became his mo&s;t inveterate enemy, and the Pope was highly di&s;gu&s;ted with a match founded upon a divorce which he had not been &s;olicited to confirm, and John had much diffi|culty to avoid annoyances as the con&s;equence thereof.</P>
<P>During the King's ab&s;ence on this expedition, Hu|bert archbi&s;hop of Canterbury held a &s;ynod there, A. D. 1200, for the purpo&s;es of &s;hewing a great ve|neration for the Roman &s;ee. In this &s;ynod he made &s;everal alterations in the admini&s;tration of eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, which the King approved, tho' contrary to the orders of the ju&s;ticiary. Each of tho&s;e new regulations concluded with a &s;alvo of the honour and privileges of the church of Rome, a form that Hubert &s;eems to have adopted to ingratiate him&s;elf with Pope Innocent, who was a pontiff of great re&s;olution and abilities, calculated for extending the papal authority. After having kindled the enthu&s;ia&s;im of the people, by the &s;ermons of his emi&s;&s;aries, he on pretence of relieving the Chri&s;tians of the Holy Land, laid a tax of the fortieth part of all eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues in Italy, Sclavonia, Germany, France and the Briti&s;h i&s;les, for the maintainance of a new cru&s;ade, to be undertaken again&s;t the Saracens, and &s;ent Philip a Roman notary to collect this impo&s;ition in England. While the Pope thus exerci&s;ed his power over the clergy, he did not fail to exhort the laity to make a voluntary contribu|tion for the &s;ame purpo&s;e; the King of France rai&s;ed the &s;ame proportion in his territories, and John not only granted the fortieth part of his revenue for one year, but al&s;o authori&s;ed the &s;ame collections from all the barons, military tenants and freeholders through|out the kingdom.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="6">
<P>Soon after this,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A. D. 1002.</NOTE> the reign of John was at|tended with many precipitant mea&s;ures and un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts, plea&s;ure and indulgence were the principal &s;prings of his actions, and often|times capricious and re&s;olute, without wi&s;dom to pro|cure any favourable con&s;equences to his mea&s;ures; &s;o that when he had homage done him by William King of Scotland, it was an homage only, without any honour accruing from it. When he quarrelled with the King of France, and had made preparation for vindicating the honour of his crown, he &s;ubmitted in a pu&s;ilani|mous manner to an in&s;ignificant treaty; and &s;uffered his mind to be diverted from his own, and the nation's intere&s;t, by indulging to fea&s;ting and public enter|tainment in the enemies country. However, to &s;hew that he was able to do &s;omething, he took his elder brother's &s;on Arthur pri&s;oner, and he was cruelly murdered in the ca&s;tle of Rouen: this act of inhu|manity rendered the tyrant dete&s;table in the eyes of all mankind; however it proved the cau&s;e of Brittany being for ever di&s;membered from the Engli&s;h crown. John was likewi&s;e &s;ummoned by the peers of France, to vindicate him&s;elf from the charge of murder; which he failling to do, was condemned by the una|nimous &s;entence of the peers, couched in the&s;e terms, "Whereas John Duke of Normandy, forgetting his oath to King Philip his lord, has murdered his elder brother's &s;on, an homager of the crown of France, and the King's kin&s;man; and perpetrated the crime within the &s;igniority of France: he is found guilty of felony and trea&s;on, and adjudged to forfeit all the territories which he holds by homage."</P>
<P>Philip was extremely incen&s;ed again&s;t the author of that cruel tragedy, which he determined in earne&s;t to revenge, and a&s;&s;embled a body of troops, and march|ing towards Anjou, almo&s;t all the barons of that pro|vince and Poitou revolted from John, and many of
<PB N="6" REF="7">the Engli&s;h noblemen of approved fidelity de&s;erted him, and put them&s;elves under Philip's protection.</P>
<P>John however found means to make &s;ome depreda|tions in Normandy, and about the middle of Augu&s;t, A. D. 1023, he undertook the &s;iege of Chateau Gail|lard, on the banks of the Seine, built by Richard, and &s;uppo&s;ed impregnable. John, though at the head of an army equal in number to the French, was afraid of hazarding a battle, partly from cowardice, the con&s;equence of his guilt, and partly from a &s;u&s;|picion of his &s;oldiers: he therefore &s;olicited the Pope's mediation, and his holine&s;s &s;ent two abbots to nego|tiate a peace. Upon this the King of France di&s;patched &s;ome of his prelates to the Pope, who repre&s;ented the conduct of John &s;o notorious, that the Pope declined his mediation; and &s;oon after the King relinqui&s;hed his Norman dominions, and left them to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the French, while Philip blocked up the ca&s;tle of Gaillard, took Audely, and even reduced Radepont, an impor|tant place in the neighbourhood of Rouen. The King of England indulged him&s;elf in riot and &s;loth, &s;aying, when he was reminded of Philip's progre&s;s, "Let him proceed; I &s;hall recover more in one day than he can conquer in a whole twelvemonth." But though John had not &s;pirit enough to oppo&s;e the French King, he was &s;oon after &s;o alarmed at the conque&s;t he had made, that he rai&s;ed an army and invaded Britain, took &s;everal towns, and pillaged the country, but then reimbarked without doing any thing con&s;iderable for his own honour, or the nation's advantage. The whole duchy of Normandy was now &s;ubdued, except Ver|nueil, Arques and Rouen, which engaged in a league for their mutual defence; but were at length over|powered, and Normandy was reunited to the kingdom of France, after a &s;eparation of two hundred and ninety two years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet's Hi&s;tory of England, vol. II. pag. 305.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="8">
<P>King John affected to complain loudly of the noblemen, who had left him at Rouen,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A. D. 1204.</NOTE> as if their retreat had occa&s;ioned the lo&s;s of Normandy; and, on this pretence, extorted from them a &s;eventh part of their moveables: he likewi&s;e contrived means for lay|ing impo&s;ts upon the convents and pari&s;h-churches; and a&s;&s;embled a great council at Oxford, in order to delibe|rate upon mea&s;ures for retrieving his dominions on the continent. To defray the expence of this expedition, a &s;cutage was charged upon the nobles and military te|nants; nor were the prelates and clergy exempted from this burthen. But the&s;e aids were employed in &s;up|plying his own extravagance.</P>
<P>John's character was &s;o irregular and un&s;ettled, that his conduct could not be con&s;i&s;tent or uniform. He was by turns frightened into compliance, and pro|voked into the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate oppo&s;ition. This period gave birth to his quarrel with the Pope, which invol|ved him&s;elf and the nation in great calamities. Hu|bert archbi&s;hop of Canterbury dying at his palace, the younger monks of Chri&s;t-church, a&s;&s;embled that very night, cho&s;e Reginald, their &s;ub-prior, for his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, &s;ung <HI>Te Deum,</HI> and placed him upon the archiepi&s;copal throne. This new elect &s;et out before morning, with &s;ome of the monks for Rome, where he hoped to be confirmed; and all concerned in the clan|de&s;tine election took an oath of &s;ecrecy, on which their &s;ucce&s;s was &s;uppo&s;ed to depend. Reginald, with|out regarding this obligation, no &s;ooner arrived on the continent than, giving way to the dictates of vanity, he promulgated his elevation, as well as the intent of the journey; and, when he arrived at Rome, Innocent refu&s;ed to confirm him, until he &s;hould be better in|formed of the affair.</P>
<P>This pontiff had already, on pretence of reliev|ing the Chri&s;tians in the Holy Land,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A. D. 1207.</NOTE> laid a tax upon the Engli&s;h church, which being levied with|out murmurs, he was encouraged to exert the &s;ame power
<PB N="8" REF="9">for his own private advantage. With this view he had, during the vacancy of the metropolitan &s;ee, &s;ent John Ferentino as his legate into England; and a national &s;ynod was called at St. Alban's, though a royal mandate put a &s;top to their proceedings: but while John was abroad in Guienne, the legate convoked another at Reading, where he laid an impo&s;ition on the clergy, amounting to a con&s;iderable &s;um, with which he made his retreat before the King's return. This was &s;uch an agreeable &s;ample of what might be drawn from Eng|land, that Innocent re&s;olved to fill the vacant arch|bi&s;hopric with one of his creatures, who would &s;up|port his authority. He therefore recommended to the deputies of the convent, Stephen Langton, a Roman cardinal of Engli&s;h de&s;cent, though bred in Paris; and when the monks ob&s;erved that their commi&s;&s;ion did not extend to an election, which indeed they dur&s;t not undertake without the King's con&s;ent, and expre&s;s powers from their convent; the Pope over-ruled all their objections, and commanded them to chu&s;e Lang|ton, on pain of excommunication. Thus threatened, eleven of the number complied: and Stephen was con&s;ecrated by Innocent at Viterbo.</P>
<P>The ceremony being performed, the Pope wrote a courtly letter of recommendation in his favour to the King, whom he pre&s;ented with a few baubles to avert his indignation: at the &s;ame time, the monks of Chri&s;t-church were enjoined upon their obedience to receive Langton as their archbi&s;hop; and other letters were written to the chief nobility, &s;oliciting their good offices with the King, in behalf of that prelate. All the&s;e precautions were in&s;ufficient to appea&s;e the wrath of John, who forthwith &s;ent a body of troops to expel the monks of Canterbury, and hang them, &s;hould they refu&s;e to quit the kingdom immediately. They were obliged to embark for Flanders without delay; their effects were &s;eized, their tenants ejected, and their places &s;upplied with &s;ome monks belonging
<PB N="9" REF="10">to the abbey of St. Augu&s;tin. In an&s;wer to the Pope's letter, John gave him to under&s;tand, that he was de|termined to maintain the honour of his crown, and &s;upport the election of the bi&s;hop of Norwich; and that if his holine&s;s &s;hould thwart him in this particular, he would &s;uffer no appeals in eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;putes to be carried before any foreign court of judicature. Innocent, far from being intimidated by the&s;e menaces, &s;ent orders for the bi&s;hops of London, Worce&s;ter, and Ely, to exhort the King in his name to receive arch|bi&s;hop Langton, and recal the monks of Chri&s;t church; and, in ca&s;e of his refu&s;al, to lay the kingdom under an interdict. John was terrified by the declaration of the&s;e prelates, and offered to obey the Pope's orders, with a &s;alvo of his rights, dignity, and prerogative: but Innocent would hear of no &s;alvo, or other terms, than his delivery of the regalia with his own hand to archbi&s;hop Langton, and his making immediate and full re&s;titution to the convent. The King rejected his propo&s;al; and the three prelates having laid the king|dom under an interdict, retired to the continent, whi|ther they were followed by the bi&s;hops of Bath and Hereford. A &s;top was immediately put to divine &s;er|vice, and the admini&s;tration of all the &s;acraments but bapti&s;m: church-doors were &s;hut, and the dead buried in ditches and highways, without the u&s;ual rites, or any funeral &s;olemnity. Notwith&s;tanding this interdict, the Ci&s;tercian order continued to perform divine &s;ervice publicly: the cen&s;ures was &s;lighted by the bi&s;hops of Winche&s;ter and Norwich: &s;ome of the parochial clergy &s;till officiated, and &s;everal learned divines preached again&s;t the inju&s;tice of the Pope's proceedings.</P>
<P>John was equally enraged and terrified at the pro&s;pect of being excommunicated by name,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A D. 1208.</NOTE> and &s;eeing his &s;ubjects ab&s;olved of their alle|giance. He ordered all the prelates, clergy and their abettors, who ob&s;erved the interdict, to leave the
<PB N="10" REF="11">kingdom, and &s;eized their lands and revenues; though this order was &s;oon revoked.</P>
<P>John convoking an a&s;&s;embly of all the abbots and chiefs of religious orders through the king|dom,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A. D. 1210.</NOTE> extorted from the above an hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. The Ci&s;tercians pleading their privilege, and refu&s;ing to pay their proportion, he fleeced them to &s;uch a degree, that almo&s;t all their hou&s;es were reduced to beggary, except the convent of Beaulieu in Hamp&s;hire, which he him&s;elf had founded, as an act of penance for the murther of Arthur, and that of Margam in Glamorgan&s;hire, where he had been &s;umptuou&s;ly entertained in his way to Ireland, and at his return: the&s;e were exempted from the im|po&s;itions; but all the other Ci&s;tercians were not only impoveri&s;hed, but debarred all corre&s;pondence with their order abroad. Indeed an embargo was laid upon the &s;hipping in all the ports of England, to prevent an intercour&s;e of per&s;ons between this kingdom and the continent, without an immediate licence: and a pro|clamation was publi&s;hed, requiring all Engli&s;h bi&s;hops and eccle&s;ia&s;tics, re&s;iding in foreign parts, to return at a certain time, otherwi&s;e their benefices would be &s;eized for the King's u&s;e; the prohibition was like|wi&s;e renewed, again&s;t all exerci&s;e of the papal autho|rity in England, on pain of corporal puni&s;hment. Not contented with &s;etting the Pope at defiance, and the contributions he had already received, he laid another talliage on the clergy, to defray the expence of an expedition again&s;t the Wel&s;h, who had made &s;ome incur&s;ions over the Engli&s;h borders. He accord|ingly a&s;&s;embled a numerous army at O&s;we&s;tre, and ad|vancing along the &s;ea-coa&s;t as far as Conway, burned Bangor, and committed &s;uch ravages in the country, that Llewellyn prince of North-Wales, who had reti|red with his people, cattle, and effects, into the moun|tains of Snowdun in Caernarvon&s;hire, &s;eeing his country de&s;olate, &s;ent his wife Jane, the King's own natural
<PB N="11" REF="12">daughter, to &s;ue for peace, which was granted,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A. D. 1211.</NOTE> on condition of his paying twenty thou&s;and head of cattle, forty hor&s;es. delivering ho&s;tages, and doing homage; &s;o that John returned in triumph to Whitchurch; and levied a &s;cutage upon all knights who had not attended him in the expedition.</P>
<P>The Pope, at his reque&s;t, had &s;ent Pandulf, a Ro|man &s;ubdeacon, and Durand, a knight templar, into England, to accommodate all differences between the regal and pontifical powers; and John now a&s;&s;embled a general council of his lay nobility at Northampton, to treat with the&s;e deputies: but, as he &s;till refu&s;ed to make full re&s;titution to the clergy, they returned to France, after having publi&s;hed his excommunication. Neverthele&s;s, he did not de&s;pair of being recon|ciled to the Pope upon ea&s;ier terms,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A. D. 1212.</NOTE> and ordered &s;ome of his chaplains to accompany the nun|cios to Rome, with powers and in&s;tructions for ef|fecting a &s;olid peace. Mean while, in a conference at Durham, he renewed the alliance with William King of Scotland, who&s;e &s;on Alexander, now fourteen years of age, attended him to London, where the King knighted him at Clerkenwell; and, at the &s;ame time, received the homage of Alan lord of Galloway, for a large tract of country, given to that nobleman in the north of Ireland.</P>
<P>The King had no rea&s;on to expect extraordinary proofs of attachment from his nobility, who generally de&s;pi&s;ed his character, and abhorred his admini&s;tration. He had made too free with their wives and daugh|ters, impoveri&s;hed them by taxes, &s;eized their e&s;tates, and in&s;ulted their per&s;ons: he had even ventured to make a general inqui&s;ition into the deme&s;nes of the crown, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by his predece&s;&s;ors: an odious mea&s;ure at all times; but extremely alarming in the reign of &s;uch a tyrant as John, who they knew would &s;eize the lea&s;t flaw or defect in their titles, as a pretence for depriving them of their fortunes; &s;o that he was
<PB N="12" REF="13">at once the object of their terror and contempt. Want|ing nothing but an opportunity to &s;hake off his yoke, they were rejoiced at the cen&s;ures pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t him by the Pope, who they imagined would pur&s;ue his blow, and &s;end an army to their relief, in imitation of the cru&s;ade, which he had rai&s;ed again&s;t the Albi|gen&s;es. Had Simon de Monfort compleated the re|duction, of this people, in all probability the Pope would have &s;ent that renowned general, with his vic|torious forces, into England; but, as the war in Lan|guedoc was &s;till unfini&s;hed, the Engli&s;h nobility, im|patient of delay, entered into an a&s;&s;ociation again&s;t John; and by an authentic deed, &s;igned and &s;ealed by every individual of the confederacy, invited Philip King of France to come over, and receive the crown of England, which they would a&s;&s;i&s;t him in wre&s;ting from the u&s;urper.</P>
<P>While John &s;hielded him&s;elf again&s;t the ma|chinations of his enemies,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A. D. 1213.</NOTE> cardinal Langton, with the exiled bi&s;hops of London and Ely, repaired to Rome, and earne&s;tly intreated the Pope to proceed to the depo&s;ition of John, whom they repre&s;ented as a mon|&s;ter and tyrant, the object of univer&s;al hate and abhor|rence. Innocent, in compliance with their reque&s;t, a&s;|&s;embled a council of cardinals and prelates, in which he &s;olemnly depo&s;ed John, and declared the throne of Eng|land vacant: then he wrote to Philip King of France, enjoining him to execute the &s;entence, and unite Eng|land to his dominions for ever. He at the &s;ame time publi&s;hed a cru&s;ade again&s;t the depo&s;ed monarch all over Europe, exhorting the nobility, knights, and all men what&s;oever, to take up arms again&s;t that per&s;ecu|tor of the church, and enli&s;t under the banners of Philip, be&s;towing upon them the &s;ame indulgences that were granted to tho&s;e who engaged again&s;t the in|fidels in the Holy-Land: and, la&s;tly, he appointed Pandulf, his legate a latere, to &s;ee the &s;entence put in execution. Not but that he &s;upplied him at the
<PB N="13" REF="14">&s;ame time with in&s;tructions and powers to make peace with John upon certain conditions, which if he &s;hould delay accepting, till a certain day fixed for his final re&s;olve, the legate was ordered to return immedi|ately.</P>
<P>Soon after Pandulf, who then re&s;ided at Rome, wrote to his maje&s;ty, to a&s;&s;ure him of his hearty de&s;ire to employ his good offices in his behalf, and propo&s;ing a conference to &s;ettle the terms of his reconciliation with the church. John immediately embraced the propo|&s;al, and met the legate at Dover, where in a conference Pandulf expatiated upon the prodigious armament of Philip, the influence of the exiled prelates and nobility, who would accompany that monarch in his expedition, and the di&s;&s;atisfaction of the Engli&s;h, who had invited him to engage in &s;uch an undertaking. John, con|&s;cious of his own guilt and unpopular character, was frightened at the picture he drew, and was &s;o terrified by the&s;e concurring con&s;iderations, that he agreed to the legate's propo&s;als of peace; and &s;wore to the ob|&s;ervance of them, in pre&s;ence of the count of Boulogne, the earls of Sali&s;bury, Warrenne, and Ferrers, who likewi&s;e promi&s;ed, upon oath, to concur in the execu|tion of the articles, to the following effect: King John &s;hall admit into his favour archbi&s;hop Langton, and be reconciled to the exiled prelates, who &s;hall re&s;ume their functions, and exerci&s;e their authority without in|terruption: Robert Fitzwalter, Eu&s;tace de Ve&s;ci, and all others both of the clergy and laity, concerned in the a&s;&s;ociation, &s;hall be pardoned, and re&s;tored to their honours and e&s;tates; full re&s;titution &s;hall be made of all liberty and property which has been taken away in the cour&s;e of this di&s;pute; eight thou&s;and pounds &s;hall be immediately remitted in part of re&s;titution to the ex|iled prelates, for the payment of their debts and the expence of their return; and their agents &s;hall be put into immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their effects and temporali|ties; John &s;hall relea&s;e all homage exacted from the
<PB N="14" REF="15">va&s;&s;als &s;ince the interdict; rever&s;e all &s;entences pro|nounced again&s;t clergymen or laymen on account of this di&s;pute; and oblige him&s;elf to refrain from i&s;&s;uing writs of outlawry again&s;t churchmen for the future; all di&s;putes about damages &s;hall be determined by the legate, or be referred to the Pope's deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>Though this reconciliation with the Pope removed all eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ures from the King and kingdom, and freed John from all the odium and danger which attended the re&s;entment of the clergy, it could not pre|vent the inva&s;ion of Philip, nor appea&s;e the di&s;contents of the nobility, who had engaged to a&s;&s;i&s;t that monarch in his endeavours to a&s;cend the Engli&s;h throne. The&s;e alarming circum&s;tances &s;till remained; and it required a very extraordinary expedient to prevent the mi&s;chief that might en&s;ue. No &s;cheme occurred &s;o fea&s;ible as that of putting his kingdom under the protection of the Roman &s;ee, by which it would be &s;creened from all attempts of chri&s;tian invaders; at lea&s;t it would tran&s;|late the odium from John to his enemies; and perhaps the artillery of the church might become as terrible to the monarch of France, as it had been to the King of England. John, finding him&s;elf reduced to the alter|native of reigning as a va&s;&s;al to the Pope, or of being depo&s;ed altogether, and treated as a murderer, u&s;urper, and tyrant, had no room for he&s;itation. He re&s;olved to do homage to Innocent; and the ceremony was per|formed in the hou&s;e of the Templars at Dover. He re&s;igned his crown to the Pope's legate, and received it again as a pre&s;ent from the &s;ee of Rome, to which he &s;wore fealty as a va&s;&s;al and feudatory. He obliged him|&s;elf and his heirs to pay an acknowledgment of the pope's &s;uperiority; and, in lieu of &s;ervice, an annual tribute of &s;even hundred marks for the kingdom of England, and three hundred for Ireland: but, even in this act of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, he re&s;erved to him&s;elf and his heirs the power of admini&s;tering ju&s;tice, and all his rights and regalities. This &s;hameful ceremony was performed on
<PB N="15" REF="16">a&s;cen&s;ion-day, in the mid&s;t of a great concour&s;e of peo|ple, who beheld it with &s;hame and indignation. John, in doing homage to the Pope, pre&s;ented a &s;um of money to his repre&s;entative, which the proud legate trampled under his feet as a mark of the King's de|pendence. Every &s;pectator glowed with re&s;entment; and the archbi&s;hop of Dublin exclaimed aloud again&s;t &s;uch intolerable in&s;olence. Pandulf, not &s;atisfied with this mortifying act of &s;uperiority, kept the crown and &s;cepter five whole days, and then re&s;tored them as the &s;pecial favour of the holy &s;ee. John was de&s;pi&s;ed be|fore this extraordinary re&s;ignation; but now he was looked upon as a contemptible wretch, unworthy to &s;it upon the throne; while he him&s;elf &s;eemed altoge|ther in&s;en&s;ible of his di&s;grace; nor did his pride and cruelty abate in con&s;equence of this humiliation: he &s;eemed to triumph in his having pre&s;erved his crown in &s;pite of the prediction of the hermit, who had been impri&s;oned with a view to puni&s;h him, in ca&s;e he &s;hould be found to have deceived the people with a fal&s;e pro|phecy; and now, though it was plainly verified, he ordered him to be hanged as an impo&s;tor.</P>
<P>The nobles and barons of the kingdom reviled him as a &s;candalous va&s;&s;al of the Pope, to whom he had given up the independence of the kingdom. They employed all their arts and emi&s;&s;aries to kindle a &s;pirit of revolt in the nation; and as every baron &s;aw his own advantage connected with the &s;ucce&s;s of their &s;cheme, there was not a nobleman of any con&s;equence in the king|dom, who did not either per&s;onally engage in the de|&s;ign, or at lea&s;t wi&s;h well to the undertaking. Their guards and &s;tations being properly di&s;po&s;ed, and all &s;u&s;picious per&s;ons &s;ecured, they wrote circular letters to all the nobility and gentlemen, who had not yet declared in their favour, inviting them to e&s;pou&s;e their cau&s;e, and fight for their liberties; and threatening, in ca&s;e of refu&s;al, to de&s;troy their ca&s;tles and e&s;tates; an alternative which had &s;uch an effect upon tho&s;e to
<PB N="16" REF="17">whom it was propo&s;ed, that the majority of them re|paired forthwith to London to engage in the a&s;&s;o|ciation.</P>
<P>When they rejected John's offers to aboli&s;h any evil cu&s;toms which might have been introduced in his reign, or in that of his brother Richard, and to re|dre&s;s their grievances by the advice of his council, he appealed to Langton and his &s;uffragans, de&s;iring them to fulminate the thunder of the church upon tho&s;e who had taken arms again&s;t a prince engaged in the cru&s;ade, who&s;e per&s;on and dominions were accounted &s;acred. Pandulf thought his reque&s;t was rea&s;onable: but the archbi&s;hop declared, he would not pa&s;s any cen&s;ure upon the barons, while John expre&s;&s;ed a &s;u&s;picion of the fidelity of his own &s;ubjects, in &s;ending for a body of mercenary auxiliaries from the continent; though if he would di&s;mi&s;s tho&s;e foreigners, he would not only excommunicate his enemies, but even join him per|&s;onally in oppo&s;ing them. Langton him&s;elf was at the head of the confederacy, and made this propo&s;al on purpo&s;e to deprive John of all foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The &s;cheme &s;ucceeded. The King di&s;banded a great body of Germans and Flemings, whom he had retained in his &s;ervice: but &s;till the archbi&s;hop refu&s;ed to excom|municate the revolting barons. Finding him&s;elf thus outwitted and betrayed, and the defection almo&s;t uni|ver&s;al, he thought it was better to reign as a limited prince, than &s;acrifice his crown, and perhaps his life, to the prerogative. He offered to refer the di&s;pute to four noblemen cho&s;en from each party, under the ar|bitration of the Pope; and this propo&s;al being reject|ed, he &s;ubmitted at di&s;cretion, promi&s;ing to grant their demands, and de&s;iring they would meet his com|mi&s;&s;ioners to conclude the treaty on Runamede, be|tween Staines and Wind&s;or. There the barons ap|peared with a va&s;t number of knights and warriors, on the fifteenth day of June; and commi&s;&s;ioners on both &s;ides being appointed, the conferences began: but as
<PB N="17" REF="18">the King's agents were generally in the intere&s;t of the barons, no debates en&s;ued; and, in a few days, by the mediation of Langton, they adju&s;ted the articles of the tow famous charters, called Magna Charta, and Cha$$a de Fore&s;ta, which are the foundation of the Engli&s;h liberty and con&s;titution; or rather the confirmation and augmentation of tho&s;e rights and privileges, which the prelates and barons had enjoyed under the Saxon monarchs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e were, a right to di&s;po&s;e of their per&s;onal e&s;tates, and of their daughters, &s;i&s;ters, and nieces, in marriage, without paying a fine for a licence; the liberty of widows to marry; exemption of the ploughs on their deme&s;nes from talliage; reduction of reliefs to a rea&s;onable &s;um; ve&s;ting the cu&s;tody of minors in their neare&s;t re|lations; and quitting claim to the profits of the vacancy of churches. Mat. Paris.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The great charter confirmed that which was lately granted to the clergy, touching the freedom of elec|tions; allowed per&s;ons to leave the kingdom without a &s;pecial licence, except in time of war; ordained that no clergyman &s;hould be amerced in proportion to his eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefice, but only according to his lay tenement; &s;ecured to the lay nobility the cu&s;tody of vacant abbies and convents, which were under their patronage; fixed the reliefs for earldoms, baronies, and knights fees, which before were arbitrary; decreed that barons &s;hould recover the lands of their va&s;&s;als forfeited for felony, after they &s;hould have been a year and a day in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown; that they &s;hould enjoy the ward&s;hips of their military tenants, who held other lands of the crown by a different tenure; that a per&s;on knighted by the King, though a minor, &s;hould enjoy the privileges of a full-grown man, provided he was a ward of the crown; but &s;uch knighthood con|ferred upon the ward of a baron, &s;hould not deprive that baron of the benefit of his ward&s;hip; that widows &s;hould not be forced to marry again&s;t their inclinations, or pay any fine for their dowers; that the ward&s;hips of
<PB N="18" REF="19">minors &s;hould not be &s;old; that the guardians &s;hould not take unrea&s;onable profits from the lands of his ward, or commit wa&s;te, but keep the hou&s;es in good repair, leave the farms well &s;tocked, and give away the ward in marriage without di&s;paragement; that no &s;cutage or aid &s;hould be levied in the kingdom, with|out the con&s;ent of the common council of the realm, except in ca&s;e of ran&s;oming the King's per&s;on, knight|ing his elde&s;t &s;on, and marrying his daughter; that no freeman &s;hould be taken, impri&s;oned, or di&s;&s;eized of his freehold, liberties or free cu&s;toms, but by the law|ful judgment of his peers, or by legal proce&s;s; that &s;heriffs &s;hould not hold county-courts above once a month; and that they, as well as ca&s;tellans, coroners, and king's bailiffs, &s;hould be re&s;trained from holding pleas of the crown: that the &s;heriffs having the management of the crown-revenue within their &s;everal di&s;tricts, &s;hould not rai&s;e the farms of counties, hun|dreds, and tythings, according to their plea&s;ure, ex|cept in the King's deme&s;ne manors; that the people &s;hould not be maliciou&s;ly pro&s;ecuted and put to cano|nical purgations without legal proof, in regard to car|riages, purveyance of victuals, and other &s;ervices; that amerciaments &s;hould be proportioned to the offence and circum&s;tances of the offender, &s;o as not to affect his landed e&s;tate, or di&s;able him from following his vocation, but be rated by a verdict of twelve creditable men in the neightbourhood. The Charta de Fore&s;ta was intended to prevent the extortion of fore&s;ters; to allow freeholders to improve their lands and woods within the limits of the fore&s;t; to disfore&s;t all lands taken in &s;ince the coronation of Henry I. except the crown deme&s;nes; to regulate the fore&s;t courts; to exempt tho&s;e that lived without the fore&s;ts from the trouble of attending tho&s;e courts, except when &s;um|moned for &s;ome tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; to annul all outlawries for &s;uch tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; and to convert the penalty for
<PB N="19" REF="20">killing veni&s;on, from a capital puni&s;hment to a fine, or in ca&s;e of in&s;olvency to a year's impri&s;onment.</P>
<P>The&s;e articles being e&s;tabli&s;hed, a number of the nobility applied to John for the re&s;titution of lands, and the government of ca&s;tles which belonged to them by hereditary right; and he appointed an inqui&s;ition to examine their preten&s;ions; but, in the mean time, he gave up the ca&s;tle of Roche&s;ter to archbi&s;hop Lang|ton, as a government which of old belonged to the &s;ee of Canterbury. Orders were now i&s;&s;ued for the ob|&s;ervance of the peace, and the charters over all Eng|land; John remitted all crimes and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions com|mitted from the foregoing Ea&s;ter to the conclu&s;ion of the treaty; and the barons renewed their homage, which they had publickly renounced at the beginning of their revolt. Neverthele&s;s, they would not comply with his de&s;ire, of having a certificate of this homage under their hands and &s;eals; and he was not a little alarmed at their refu&s;al.</P>
<P>In the hi&s;tory of John's reign we have been &s;o cir|cum&s;tantial in relating his di&s;putes with the Pope, that very few eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, of any con&s;equence, re|main to be recorded. The Pope being de&s;irous of levying an extraordinary Rome&s;cot, or St. Peter's Penny,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A. D. 1206.</NOTE> the Bi&s;hops a&s;&s;embled a Synod to deli|berate upon his demand; but the King forbid|ding them to proceed, they &s;eparated, without coming to any re&s;olution. Neverthele&s;s, a legate, named Florentine, convoked another council at Reading, upon the &s;ame &s;ubject; and, as if the clergy had in|fluenced the King's refu&s;al, he extorted from them a &s;ub&s;idy in lieu of the extraordinary Rome&s;cot, which would have affected the whole kingdom. We have already mentioned the councils that were a&s;&s;embled, to regulate the re&s;titution to the exiled bi&s;hops after John's reconciliation with his holine&s;s; but we &s;hall take notice of the twelfth council of the Lateran, held, during this, by Pope Innocent III. at which four
<PB N="20" REF="21">hundred and twelve bi&s;hops a&s;&s;i&s;ted. This a&s;&s;embly enacted four&s;core canons; one of which, in formal terms, e&s;tabli&s;hes the doctrine of Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation; but the third &s;eems to have been calculated for rai&s;ing the eccle&s;ia&s;tical power on the ruins of all civil right and authority. By this the Council decreed, that all &s;overeigns &s;hould be required and &s;olicited, and, if need were, con&s;trained by eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ures, to promi&s;e upon oath, that they would exert their en|deavours to exterminate heretics from their domi|nions: That the &s;ame oath &s;hould be exacted from all per&s;ons promoted to any dignity, &s;piritual or tempo|ral: That if any temporal lord refu&s;ed to purge his country, or deme&s;nes, of heretics, after having been &s;um|moned for that purpo&s;e, he &s;hould be excommunicated by the metropolitan, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his &s;uffragans; in ca&s;e of contempt, or refu&s;al of &s;atisfaction within one year, that the Pope &s;hould declare his &s;ubjects and va&s;&s;als ab&s;olved from their oath of allegiance, and at the &s;ame time exhort the catholic princes to fall upon his terri|tories, &s;aving the right of paramount to the &s;overeign of the fief, provided there &s;hould be &s;uch right; on condition, however, that the &s;overeign &s;hould do no|thing to the prejudice of this canon. In the fourteenth it was decreed, that prie&s;ts who abandoned them&s;elves to debauchery, in tho&s;e places where marriage was per|mitted, &s;hould be more &s;everely puni&s;hed than tho&s;e who lived in countries where they were obliged to pro|fe&s;s celibacy. From which article we learn, that the celibacy of the prie&s;ts was not univer&s;ally e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>John was, in his per&s;on, taller than the middle &s;ize, of a good &s;hape, and agreeable countenance. With re&s;pect to his di&s;po&s;ition, it is &s;trongly delineated in the tran&s;actions of his reign. If his under&s;tanding was contemptible, his heart was the object of dete&s;tation: we find him &s;lothful, &s;hallow, proud, imperious, &s;ud|den, ra&s;h, cruel, vindictive, perfidious, cowardly, libidinous, and incon&s;tant: abject in adver&s;ity, and
<PB N="21" REF="22">overbearing in &s;ucce&s;s; condemned and hated by his &s;ubjects, over whom he tyrannized to the utmo&s;t of his power; abhorred by the clergy, whom he oppre&s;&s;ed with exactions; and de&s;pi&s;ed by all the neighbouring princes of Europe. Tho' he might have pa&s;&s;ed thro' life without incurring &s;uch a load of odium and con|tempt, had not his reign been perplexed by the tur|bulence of his barons, the rapaciou&s;ne&s;s of the Pope, and the ambition of &s;uch a monarch as Philip Au|gu&s;tus, his character could never have afforded one quality that would have exempted him from the di&s;|gu&s;t and &s;corn of his people. Neverthele&s;s it mu&s;t be owned, that his reign is not altogether barren of lauda|ble tran&s;actions. He regulated the form of the civil government in the city of London, and &s;everal other places in the kingdom: he was the fir&s;t who coined &s;terling money, introduced the laws of England into Ireland, and granted to the Cinque-ports tho&s;e privi|leges of which they are &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>

<HEAD>HENRY III. A. D. 1215.</HEAD>
<P>I have been more large in the hi&s;tory of the preceding reign, as it was attended with many remarkable cir|cum&s;tances prejudicial to the prerogatives of the Briti&s;h crown, and the rights and liberties of the &s;ub|jects. This kingdom would probably, nay, mu&s;t in|evitably been made a province of France, either by the cowardice and imprudent mea&s;ures of King John, or the precipitant, impolitic re&s;entment of the barons, were it not for the interpo&s;ition of the Pope; who plainly &s;aw, it would give the balance of power in Europe into the hands of the French, which mu&s;t con|&s;equently be prejudicial to the power and &s;ecular inte|re&s;ts of his holine&s;s, and, therefore, very politicly op|po&s;ed the King of France's accepting the invitation of the barons to the crown of England: but, as the &s;e|cular intere&s;t of the Pope was a point always connected
<PB N="22" REF="23">with, and pur&s;ued in conjunction with his eccle&s;ia&s;tical authority; &s;o we find he had, by much artifice, pretty well carried his point in that reign; and, in the reign of Henry III. carried his de&s;ign to greater perfection, in&s;omuch that the nation complained, with the highe&s;t rea&s;on, of their great oppre&s;&s;ion, and impo&s;itions of the papal &s;ee.</P>
<P>A variety of circum&s;tances made way for the acce&s;|&s;ion of Henry III. to the crown, though but ten years of age; but principally thro' the intere&s;t and per&s;ua|&s;ion of William earl Mar&s;hall earl of Pembroke: a per&s;on of great under&s;tanding, well ver&s;ed in the civil affairs of the nation, the particular intere&s;ts of parties, and well affected to the intere&s;ts of Great Britain; &s;o that in a little more than twelve months, he reduced the di&s;affected, and brought the nation in general to approve of the choice of their King, and of his regen|cy; the citizens of London acting in harmony and concurrence with him. For &s;everal years nothing re|markable occurred relating to eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs; former di&s;putes, and the difficulty of adju&s;ting them, having pretty much engro&s;&s;ed the attention of the re|gent and mini&s;try.</P>
<P>About the year A. D. 1228, Gregory IX. &s;ucceeded to the papacy, at the death of Honorius III. who was &s;urvived but a few months by Stephen Langton arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury. This prelate's eyes were no &s;ooner clo&s;ed than the monks of St. Augu&s;tin, in order to pre&s;erve their privilege, elected one of their brothers, called Walter de Hemi&s;ham, without even demanding the King's permi&s;&s;ion. Henry therefore refu&s;ed to confirm his election, on pretence of his fa|ther's having been hanged for felony; and the &s;uffra|gans of Canterbury, who likewi&s;e pretended to the right of electon, found a pretext for refu&s;ing to own this new archbi&s;hop, who it &s;eems had debauched a nun, by whom he had &s;everal children. Agents were &s;ent with appeals to Rome; but the Pope declined de|ciding
<PB N="23" REF="24">the di&s;pute, until he &s;hould be better informed of the particulars; and in the mean time the &s;ee re|mained vacant. His holine&s;s at that time could not attend to &s;uch petty conte&s;ts, &s;o much was he engro&s;&s;ed by his quarrel with Frederic II. emperor of Germany, whom he now excommunicated for having deferred his voyage to the Holy-Land, according to the oath he had taken. This &s;entence excited &s;uch commotions in Germany and Italy, that Frederic was obliged to per|form his vow. France was at the &s;ame time embroiled by the regency of Blanche; and had Henry been an enterprizing prince, he might have taken the advantage of this conjuncture, to retrieve his paternal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions on the continent. The Normans, who had engaged in the intere&s;t of the French barons, again&s;t the re|gency, a&s;&s;ured the King of England, that if he would cro&s;s the &s;eas, they would receive him with open arms. The Poitevens pre&s;&s;ed him to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their country; in which ca&s;e they would a&s;&s;i&s;t him in ex|pelling the French garri&s;ons; and the Ga&s;cons depu|ted the archbi&s;hop of Bourdeaux to invite him to come and recover the inheritance of Guienne. Such pre&s;&s;ing invitations one would imagine &s;hould have been very acceptable to any prince of common cou|rage and di&s;cretion; e&s;pecially to one who had no do|me&s;tic troubles to fear: for Henry had ju&s;t concluded a peace with Llewellyn, a prince of Wales, who had made &s;ome incur&s;ions upon the Engli&s;h borders. Neverthele&s;s, he declined their propo&s;als, declaring that he would chu&s;e a more proper opportunity; whereas, &s;uch another could not be expected during the whole cour&s;e of his reign; and he afterwards ra&s;hly undertook the expedition, without the lea&s;t pro|bability of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Mean while, the Pope &s;till delayed giving judg|ment in the di&s;pute concerning the archbi&s;hopric of Canterbury, until the King's envoys made an offer to the Pope of the tenth of all moveables in England
<PB N="24" REF="25">and Ireland. This propo&s;ition threw a new light upon the conte&s;t, and his holine&s;s immediately annulled the election of the monks; but at the &s;ame time he ar|rogated to him&s;elf the power of filling up the vacancy, appointing by his own authority Richard le$$$ant chancellor of the church of Lincoln, to the archie|pi&s;copal dignity; and this prelate was recognized by the King and &s;uffragans, who on this occa&s;ion betrayed the rights of the Anglican church. In a little time after this tran&s;action, the Pope &s;ent over one of his chaplains to collect the promi&s;ed tythe, in order to &s;upport a war again&s;t the emperor; and he pre&s;ented the Pontiff's letter to the great council of the kingdom, de&s;iring that this aid might be levied without delay. All the members were a&s;toni&s;hed at the propo&s;al, and turned their eyes upon the King, expecting that he would di&s;claim the conduct of his envoys, who had made &s;uch an extravagant promi&s;e: but they &s;oon per|ceived by his &s;ilence, that the offer had been made by his direction; and in the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of their indig|nation, re&s;olved that their va&s;&s;als &s;hould not be expo&s;ed to any &s;uch exaction. Neverthele&s;s, as a mark of their re&s;pect to his holine&s;s, they agreed to grant him a donation, without proceeding to any inquiry into the effects of individuals. They were, however, diverted from executing this re&s;olution, by the behaviour of Stephen Seagrave, one of the riche&s;t and mo&s;t popular members of the a&s;&s;embly, who voluntarily &s;ubmitted to the tax; and a great number was influenced by his example, till at la&s;t the whole council, including ec|cle&s;ia&s;tics as well as laymen, acquie&s;ced in the de|mand, rather than incur the wrath of the King, and cen&s;ures of Gregory. This point being &s;ettled, the nuncio produced a commi&s;&s;ion, inve&s;ting him with full power to levy the tax upon all moveables what|&s;oever. He forthwith proceeded to the execution of his orders, and exacted the tythe with &s;uch rigour, that the people were obliged to pay ready money for
<PB N="25" REF="26">the fruits of the earth even while growing: the pre|lates and abbots were compelled to advance the tax for their inferior clergy; and, as they could not con|veniently rai&s;e the &s;ums demanded, they were &s;upplied by Italian u&s;urers, whom the nuncio had brought along with him for this purpo&s;e. The earl of Che&s;ter, however, in&s;i&s;ted upon his prerogative of palatine, and would not &s;uffer the nuncio, or any of his agents, to &s;et foot within his territories. The King and the Pope &s;eemed to have a fellow-feeling in this collection; and in all probability &s;hared the money that was levied, according to a previous re&s;olution to fleece the people in concert; for they afterwards &s;upported each other reciprocally, in all their mutual &s;chemes of extortion.</P>
<P>This with &s;ome former efforts of this young prince, were very unfavourable and di&s;&s;atisfactory to the people.</P>
<P>In A. D. 1231, the court of Rome having u&s;ed its influence in a very unpopular manner, that a general clamour aro&s;e all over England, again&s;t the practice of be&s;towing benefices upon Italian prie&s;ts, and inhibi|ting Engli&s;h bi&s;hops, and lay-patrons to pre&s;ent na|tives, until tho&s;e foreigners &s;hould be preferred. This was con&s;idered as a national in&s;ult and grievance, and a number of a&s;&s;ociations were formed for delivering the kingdom from &s;uch &s;hameful oppre&s;&s;ion. Circular letters were &s;ent to bi&s;hops and chapters, warning them again&s;t favouring &s;uch encroachments, on pain of having their hou&s;es burned, and their farms de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>While the pope's repre&s;entations &s;queezed money from the eccle&s;ia&s;tics of England, the laity were plun|dered by the king's exactions. The pope, and his va&s;&s;al Henry, &s;eemed to vie with each other in pil|laging the people; and nothing could have induced the Engli&s;h to &s;uffer &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ion under a king of Henry's contemptible character, but the dread of pa|pal re&s;entment, and the remembrance of tho&s;e mi&s;eries in which civil war had &s;o lately involved the kingdom.
<PB N="26" REF="27">The bi&s;hops held another convocation at London, where they pre&s;ented a remon&s;trance to the king, com|plaining that he converted the vacant bi&s;hoprics to his own u&s;e, and retarded the elections by rai&s;ing unju&s;t ob&s;tacles, until his own choice was approved by the chapters; nay, they even proceeded &s;o far as to excom|municate tho&s;e who gave him this pernicious coun&s;el: but he placed &s;uch confidence in the protection of the pope, that very little regard was paid to their repre|&s;entations: he was even &s;o ba&s;e and degenerate as to glory in his dependance on the Roman &s;ee; and when the emperor &s;ent an emba&s;&s;y to expo&s;tulate with him about his having publi&s;hed the &s;entence of excommu|nication, he replied that he was va&s;&s;al to the pope, who&s;e injunctions he dur&s;t not di&s;obey. Mean while the legate, on his return from Scotland, renewed his arbitrary exactions, levying con&s;iderable &s;ums from churches and mona&s;teries, under the title of Procura|tions; and at length publi&s;hed a mandate, importing, that he had a power not only to ab&s;olve from their vow &s;uch as had taken the cro&s;s intending to vi&s;it the Holy-Land, but al&s;o of compelling them to redeem them|&s;elves with money, on pain of excommunication. The&s;e extortions were countenanced and &s;econded by the pope's own immediate directions. He granted to the abbot and monks of Clugny a tenth of the profits ari&s;ing from all benefices in England, for the term of three years. But even Henry was a&s;hamed of this im|po&s;ition, and forbade the agents to collect it, on pain of incurring &s;evere penalties. His holine&s;s, far from being repul&s;ed by this prohibition, attempted to rai&s;e a fifth of all eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues, as an aid again&s;t the emperor, and accordingly exacted it from the Roman clergy &s;ettled in England, who dur&s;t not refu&s;e it to a power on which they altogether depended: it was af|terwards propo&s;ed to the prelates in a council at Read|ing, and granted by the advice and example of Ed|mund archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. But immediately
<PB N="27" REF="28">after this tran&s;action, Gregory bargained with the peo|ple of Rome for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the emperor, on condition of his providing their children and rela|tions with Engli&s;h benefices; and he &s;ent orders to Ed|mund, and the bi&s;hops of London and Sarum, to re|&s;erve for the Roman clergy three hundred of the fir&s;t livings that &s;hould fall vacant in England, on pain of being &s;u&s;pended from the power of collating. Ed|mund was extremely chagrined at this flagrant in&s;tance of in&s;olent impo&s;ition, of which he bitterly complained to Henry, from whom receiving no redre&s;s, he grew weary of his life, retired to Burgundy, where he died, and was buried in the abbey of Pontigny.</P>
<P>The king re&s;olved to &s;olicit a &s;upply from parliament, which,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A. D. 1244.</NOTE> though always aver&s;e to him in the beginning of every &s;e&s;&s;ion, he generally found means to convert to his purpo&s;e by promi&s;es of reformation. At pre&s;ent he was furni&s;hed with a pre|tence by the king of Navarre, who had invaded Ga&s;|cony, and &s;ome incur&s;ions of the Wel&s;h. The barons being a&s;&s;embled at We&s;tmin&s;ter, he him&s;elf made the motion for a &s;ub&s;idy, which was heard with manife&s;t &s;igns of di&s;content. The prelates and the laity retiring &s;eparately, re&s;olved that no grant &s;hould be made with|out their common con&s;ent; and that a committee of twelve per&s;ons &s;hould be cho&s;en to con&s;ider of proper mea&s;ures to prevent all encroachments on the two char|ters. They complained that writs had been i&s;&s;ued out of chancery to the prejudice of their liberties; de&s;ired that they might have the nomination of the chancellor and ju&s;ticiary; propo&s;ed that four noblemen of the king's council &s;hould be appointed con&s;ervators of the liberty of the kingdom, with power to in&s;pect the trea|&s;ury, and the application of the public money; to &s;um|mon a parliament as often as nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould require; and arbitrate in all differences between the king and his &s;ubjects. They demanded that all writs contrary to the cu&s;tom of the realm &s;hould be revoked; that

<PB N="28" REF="31">cen&s;ures &s;hould be publi&s;hed again&s;t all that oppo&s;ed the&s;e regulations; that the chancellor and ju&s;ticiary, cho&s;en by con&s;ent of parliament, &s;hould always be two of the four con&s;ervators; that in ca&s;e the king &s;hould deprive the chancellor of the &s;eals, all writs &s;igned by his &s;ucce&s;&s;or &s;hould be null; that be&s;ides the chancel|lor and ju&s;ticiary, the parliament &s;hould nominate two judges in the common pleas, two barons in the exche|quer, and a ju&s;tice of the Jews; and that all &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons &s;hould be removed from about the king's per|&s;on. Henry was extremely alarmed at the nature of the&s;e demands, which did not at all &s;uit with his high notions of the prerogative. He was incen&s;ed at the pre&s;umption of his va&s;&s;als; but &s;uch was his character and &s;ituation, that he dur&s;t not avow his re&s;entment. He therefore evaded their propo&s;als with general pro|mi&s;es of amendment, which he had no intention to perform; and after having tampered in vain with the members, thought proper to prorogue the parliament.</P>
<P>About the year A. D. 1250, the fa&s;hion of taking the cro&s;s was &s;o prevalent at this juncture, that Henry him&s;elf, in the mid&s;t of all his nece&s;&s;ities, profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a &s;oldier of Chri&s;t: though, in all probability, this &s;tep was the effect of &s;ome other motive more cogent than his religion. Perhaps he &s;aw no other pro&s;pect of paying his debts, which were by this time become very burthen&s;ome and di&s;graceful, than that of obtaining a &s;ub&s;idy on pretence of equipping an arma|ment for Pale&s;tine; or el&s;e he was de&s;irous of putting him&s;elf under the Pope's protection, which he thought would &s;creen him from the de&s;igns that might be hatched to his prejudice. He &s;eemed to &s;u&s;pect &s;ome|thing of this kind, from the ambition of his brother Richard, who had made a my&s;terious journey to Rome, accompanied by the earl of Glouce&s;ter, and &s;everal no|blemen and prelates. He had been care&s;&s;ed by the Pope at Lyons, who admitted him to &s;everal private conferences, the &s;ubject of which afforded great &s;pecu|lation;
<PB N="29" REF="32">and, as he had always been the chief of the malcontents, Henry might very naturally &s;u&s;pect him of &s;ome de&s;ign to his prejudice. When Henry took the cro&s;s, his example was followed by five hundred knights, &s;ome of whom had &s;old their e&s;tates to de&s;ray the expence of their voyage; and they expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t impatience to &s;et out upon the expedition: but as the King was not yet in a condition to perform his vow, he forbad them to cro&s;s the &s;ea, until he him|&s;elf &s;hould depart; and this prohibition was, at his de&s;ire, confirmed by the Pope. At the &s;ame time, his holine&s;s indulged him with the grant of a tenth of all eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues in England and Ireland for three years, to be levied and depo&s;ited until the King &s;hould &s;et out upon his voyage.</P>
<P>Honorius II. &s;ent cardinal John de Crema into Eng|land, with the title of legate; but it was not without great difficulty that he was received, after having &s;tay|ed a long time in Normandy. He a&s;&s;embled a &s;ynod at London, touching the marriage of prie&s;ts; but in the writs of &s;ummons it was expre&s;sly declared, that the council was convoked by the order and with the concurrence of the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. Al|though this legate knew his arrival was not at all agree|able to the Engli&s;h, he affected, in the exerci&s;e of his legation, an in&s;olence of deportment which not a little increa&s;ed their di&s;gu&s;t. He in&s;i&s;ted upon officiating in the church of Canterbury, altho' he was not a bi&s;hop; and in the council of London he ordered his &s;eat to be rai&s;ed like a throne, above the two archbi&s;hops and all the nobility of the kingdom. In the reign of Stephen, Alberic bi&s;hop of O&s;tia was received as the Pope's le|gate in England without oppo&s;ition, becau&s;e the King was &s;o precariou&s;ly &s;ituated that he dur&s;t not oppo&s;e the innovations of Rome. While this prince &s;at upon the throne, the Pope inve&s;ted his brother Henry bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter with the legatine power, to the preju|dice of Theobald archbi&s;hop of Canterbury This
<PB N="30" REF="33">di&s;tinction produced a quarrel between the two prelates, from which the court of Rome derived great advan|tages; for, upon this occa&s;ion, both parties appealed to the Roman &s;ee, which before that time had been very little troubled with Engli&s;h di&s;putes and refer|ences. After a long conte&s;t, the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;|ter was deprived of his legation by Pope Cele&s;tin II who conferred it upon his rival as a free gift of the ho|ly &s;ee. The court of Rome would, in all probability have extended its u&s;urpation &s;till farther, had not the &s;chi&s;ms which happened in this age kept its ambition within bounds. After the death of Honorius, there was a double election of Innocent and Anaclet, who divided all Europe with their competition; and both France and England ob&s;erved for &s;ome time a neutra|lity, during which time they paid no regard to ei|ther.</P>
<P>But what Rome lo&s;t by &s;chi&s;ms, &s;he regained by cru&s;ades, which never failed to extend her authority&punc; The fir&s;t was preached by Urban II. with &s;uch effect, that a va&s;t army of Chri&s;tians, from all parts of Eu|rope, took the cro&s;s and &s;et out for Pale&s;tine. from whence they expelled the Saracens, and founded the kingdom of Jeru&s;alem, which la&s;ted about ninety years: but the country was afterwards reconquered by the infidels; and, in order to regain the footing which the Chri&s;tians had lo&s;t, divers new cru&s;ades were in&s;ti|tuted, from which the Popes drew manifold advan|tages. The&s;e expeditions furni&s;hed them with pretexts to intermeddle in all the affairs of chri&s;tendom; to di|vert princes from other de&s;igns, which were incompa|tible with the papal intere&s;t or ambition; to impo&s;e taxes on the clergy of different kingdoms; and to de|&s;troy tho&s;e potentates who pre&s;umed to oppo&s;e their u&s;urpations; for they pretended that it was as nece&s;&s;a|ry for the glory of God to exterminate heretics as to war again&s;t infidels; and as it was their peculiar pre|rogative to determine what was and what was not he|re&s;y,
<PB N="31" REF="34">they had it always in their power to publi&s;h and preach up cru&s;ades again&s;t &s;uch princes as incurred their di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>As the authority of the Popes increa&s;ed, that of the prelates and national &s;ynods vi&s;ibly dimini&s;hed; for by an appeal to the &s;ee of Rome their canons and ordi|nances were frequently annulled and rever&s;ed. The bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter exerci&s;ed the legatine authority; by virtue of which he convoked a council at London, in pre&s;ence of his brother Stephen, when it was decreed, among other canons for church-di&s;cipline, that a per|&s;on, who violated a church or church-yard, or laid vio|lent hands on a clerk, &s;hould not be ab&s;olved by any prelate but the Pope him&s;elf; and that hu&s;bandmen &s;hould enjoy the &s;ame peace in the fields to which they were intitled in the church-yard.</P>
<P>The Popes had no &s;ooner rendered them&s;elves ab&s;olute ma&s;ters of the church, than it was deluged with an inundation of religious orders, which might be com|pared to different bands of an army, rai&s;ed to &s;upport the power and grandeur of the Roman pontiffs. The council of the Lateran had endeavoured to prevent, or reform this abu&s;e, by expre&s;sly forbidding the in|&s;titution of any new order of monks. Neverthele&s;s, Dominic Gu&s;man, a Spaniard, who had long preached again&s;t the Albigen&s;es, formed the &s;cheme of a new order, under the name of the Preaching Friars, for which he demanded the confirmation of Pope Innocent III. That pontiff at fir&s;t made &s;ome difficulty, on ac|count of the prohibition; but he afterwards pretended to have had a cele&s;tial vi&s;ion, by which he was given to under&s;tand, that he could not take any &s;tep that would be more advantageous to the church: neverthe|le&s;s, the order was not confirmed till the pontificate of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or Honorius, when it was in&s;tituted under the name of the Friars Preachers, or preaching Bro|thers: becau&s;e the individuals were de&s;tined to preach again&s;t the heretics. They were likewi&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed

<PB N="32" REF="37">by the appellation of Dominicans, from the name of their founder; and in France called Jacobins, from the &s;treet of St. Jaques, where they had their fir&s;t hou&s;e in Paris. They were intru&s;ted with the care of the inqui&s;ition, and rendered them&s;elves famous by the barbarities they committed again&s;t the pretended heretics: and they &s;ettled in England in a very little time after their in&s;titution. The order founded by Francis d'A&s;&s;i&s;i was confirmed by the &s;ome pontiff; and, in the cour&s;e of the year that &s;ucceeded their confirmation, they were &s;ettled in England. The monks, out of mode&s;ty, a&s;&s;umed the name of Minor Brothers; and though, in the &s;equel, they were di|vided into different &s;ocieties, all of them owned St. Francis d'A&s;&s;i&s;i for their chief and founder. They were re&s;tricted, by their rules, from preaching or confe&s;&s;ing in any dioce&s;e, without the permi&s;&s;ion of the bi&s;hop. This re&s;triction, however, did not long con|tinue: they repre&s;ented to the Pope, that many Chri&s;|tians were a&s;hamed to confe&s;s their &s;ins to their own pa&s;tors; that &s;everal per&s;ons &s;crupled to perform their duty, becau&s;e they knew the curates them&s;elves guilty of the &s;ame tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; and that tho&s;e prie&s;ts had not di&s;cretion to keep the &s;ecrets with which they were entru&s;ted. On the&s;e con&s;iderations, they de&s;ired and obtained a di&s;pen&s;ation for that rule of their order. The Dominicans and Franci&s;cans acquired &s;uch reputa|tion for &s;anctity, that almo&s;t every per&s;on cho&s;e a di|rector from one of tho&s;e orders; con&s;equently the churches they received were very con&s;iderable: for a long time the Popes were elected from one or other of tho&s;e &s;ocieties; &s;o that by their credit at the court of Rome, they frequently obtained effects belonging to the other orders, on pretence of the nece&s;&s;ity for their being &s;ub&s;i&s;ted. They ama&s;&s;ed prodigious wealth from benefactions of devout people, by the threats or promi&s;es of future mi&s;ery or &s;alvation. In a council held at Roche&s;ter, a new order of monks, called
<PB N="33" REF="38">Cro&s;s-bearers, demanded permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ettle in Eng|land; and produced a bull from the Pope, forbidding all per&s;ons what&s;oever to reproach or mole&s;t them, and impowering them to excommunicate tho&s;e who &s;hould violate that privilege. The &s;ynod did not think proper to grant their reque&s;t; but &s;ent them back, on pretence of adhering to the canon pa&s;&s;ed in the council of the Lateran.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of the councils held in the reign of Henry III. were convoked, as we have el&s;ewhere men|tioned, to authori&s;e and facilitate papal exactions. The Pope's legate convoked a national &s;ynod in St. Paul's church in London; and as he expected an oppo&s;ition to the canon which he intended to pa&s;s again&s;t plurali|ties, he obtained of the King a guard of two hundred men. As &s;oon as the prelates had taken their places, he ordered the canons which he had brought from Rome to be read; and when the article prohibiting pluralities was mentioned, Walter de Chantelon, bi&s;hop of Win|che&s;ter, and &s;ome others, oppo&s;ed it with great vehe|mence, and even made prote&s;ts; &s;o that the legate de|clared it &s;hould remain in force only during the time of his legation: neverthele&s;s, it was no &s;ooner approved on this condition, than an eccle&s;ia&s;tic, in the legate's train, pronounced aloud a decree of the Pope's, ordain|ing it to be ob&s;erved for ever. In the other canons it was decreed, that the number of &s;acraments &s;hould be fixed to &s;even: others fixed the vigils of Ea&s;ter and Penteco&s;t, regulated the admini&s;trations of bapti&s;m, and injoined the clergy to re&s;ide at their benefices at lea&s;t one half of the year. At a council held in Lon|don, the clergy flatly refu&s;ed to &s;upply the legate with the money which he demanded for the expence of his legation; and when he a&s;&s;embled another &s;ynod in the cour&s;e of the &s;ucceeding year, he met with no better &s;ucce&s;s in demanding one-fifth part of their revenues for the u&s;e of his holine&s;s. All the en&s;uing councils for the &s;pace of four years were convened on purpo&s;e to
<PB N="34" REF="39">demand &s;ub&s;idies from the clergy. During the war of the barons, one was held at Reading, in which was confirmed the appeal of the barons from the proceed|ings of the legate, who re&s;ided at Boulogne; and in ano|ther convened at Northampton, the legate Otho excom|municated all the members of the clergy, who had en|gaged in the party of the Earl of Leice&s;ter. The &s;ame cardinal a&s;&s;embled a national council in St. Paul's church at London, where he publi&s;hed certain con&s;ti|tutions, &s;ome of which make now a part of the canon law of the Engli&s;h church. The fir&s;t allowed laymen to admini&s;ter bapti&s;m, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity; the &s;econd forbad prie&s;ts to take money for the admini&s;tration of the &s;acraments: the ninth ordained eccle&s;ia&s;tics to re|&s;ide at their benefices: the thirteenth confirmed the right of &s;anctuary to churches: the fourteenth decreed that marriages &s;hould be celebrated in public: the twentieth forbad commutation of penance: the twenty-third prohibited the alienation of any part of the tithes due to the parochial curates: the next forbad the prac|tice of giving benefices <HI>in commendam,</HI> and vacated all tho&s;e that were be&s;towed in &s;uch a manner: the thirty-&s;econd ordained, that, before the con&s;ecration of a bi|&s;hop, inquiry &s;hould be made, whether or not he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;everal benefices without a di&s;pen&s;ation, and whe|ther or not the di&s;pen&s;ation was regular and authentic? the thirty third annulled all previous bargains made be|tween patrons and pre&s;entees.</P>
<P>It is well known how both church and common|wealth groaned under the heavy burden of the abbey drones, whil&s;t they became lords of very little le&s;s than one half of the temporalities of the kingdom, and the church, by their ingro&s;&s;ing all the be&s;t benefices. Nor was this all; for whil&s;t they were thus munificently provided for, they evidently aimed at betraying the &s;o|vereignty and wealth of the kingdom, to the u&s;urpa|tion of a dete&s;table foreign power.</P>
<PB N="35" REF="40">
<P>The nation began in general to &s;ee the corruptions of the Romi&s;h church. Enquiry &s;hewed them how di&s;&s;onant and incon&s;i&s;tent the principles and practices of the fir&s;t five ages of the Chri&s;tian church were to what prevailed at that time; that in the la&s;t ten ages ignorance had buried all their learning, only a little mi&s;guided devotion was retained for &s;ix of tho&s;e ages; and in the la&s;t four the re&s;tle&s;s ambition and u&s;urpation of the Popes were &s;upported by the &s;eeming holine&s;s of the begging-friars, and the fal&s;e counterfeits of learn|ing which were among the canoni&s;ts, &s;choolmen, and ca&s;ui&s;ts.</P>
<P>The popi&s;h guides made u&s;e of a variety of artifices, for which their religion was admirably calculated to render men &s;atisfied, in a dull, ignorant, and formal way, knowing that knowledge and learning was their common enemy, as at once di&s;covering and overthrow|ing all the &s;uper&s;tructures reared upon their &s;andy foun|dation. But what wealth, what honour, what power do their clergy enjoy? how glorious the Popes, how &s;plendid the Cardinals, how promoted and favoured their kindred and friends, while they can gratify the abu&s;ed multitude with infinite devices? The gloomy and melancholy they provide cells and nunneries for; the au&s;tere may take their fill of di&s;cipline and rigour; the impure and voluptuous have their conveniencies at hand, who with the lawle&s;s may be ea&s;ed by di&s;pen&s;a|tions; the credulous &s;hall never want miracles; the fanta&s;tical, vi&s;ions, nor the &s;uper&s;titious, ceremonies.</P>
<P>But as we have already taken a retro&s;pective view of the church of Rome, we &s;hall now more immediately confine our&s;elves to the unrea&s;onable, arbitrary, and oppre&s;&s;ive exactions of the Popi&s;h power on the rights and properties of Great Britain. Hi&s;tory will furni&s;h us with a variety of facts, by which it will appear very evident, that England had an extraordinary occa&s;ion to deem the papal yoke, a yoke of &s;lavery and oppre&s;|&s;ion in the mo&s;t affecting in&s;tances.

The Peter Pence was a penny for every hou&s;e in which was twenty penny worth of any kind of goods, to be paid yearly on Lammas-day<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stow's Annals, f. 26.</NOTE>. This grant was fir&s;t intended as a tribute of alms to &s;uch as went on pilgrimage to Rome, and &s;o it was received by Pope Pa&s;cal II. in his epi&s;tle to K. Henry I. yet the continuance occa&s;ioned the pre|tence of an ab&s;olute right. But when the Pope took part with the French, King Edward III. commanded the <HI>Peter pence</HI> &s;hould be no longer; which prohibition continued during that King's reign, 'till his &s;ucce&s;&s;or Richard II. Some offers being made to gather them again, it was referred to parliament, and by the appro|bation of the weak King was again revived. Yet it was re&s;olved by the ca&s;ui&s;ts of that time, that as an alms it might be lawfully witholden, of which John Wickliffe was one who di&s;approved the payment of it: never|thele&s;s, being indulged by the Kings, it continued to the reign of King Henry VIII. of which Sleiden takes &s;pecial notice. An attempt was made again to revive it in Queen Mary's reign; and Pope Paul IV. had &s;uch an influence with her amba&s;&s;ador, that had &s;he not died &s;oon after, it is not doubted it would have been collected again<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Antiq. of Britain, p. 322.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thus Peter-Pence vani&s;hed only, whereas &s;ome mo|na&s;teries anciently collected &s;ome proportions of them, and then an&s;wered for &s;o much to the Pope's collector. In proce&s;s of time it became fixed as a rent or duty to
<PB N="37" REF="42">the &s;aid mona&s;teries, which afterwards devolved to the crown, and from thence continued by &s;ale or grant to others, with as ample profits as the religious hou&s;es had enjoyed.

<P>We know al&s;o, that King Athelwolph, A.

This was made a demand of as long after as Pope Gregory XIII. A. C. 1573, and it was then oppo&s;ed as an unrea&s;onable taxation or demand by John of Gaunt, though it had been paid for &s;ome centuries, and, for aught we find, during that long interval, more than 700 years<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Matth.

<P><HI>Fir&s;t-fruits</HI> and tenths was another oppre&s;&s;ive ex|action of the Pope. Fir&s;t-fruits are the profits of every &s;piritual living for one year, and the&s;e were an|ciently called annates, becau&s;e the rates of fir&s;t-fruits or &s;piritual livings is after one year's profit of the &s;ame. Tenths are the tenth part of the fir&s;t-fruits or yearly value of all &s;piritual livings. The&s;e were paid, as in England, throughout all we&s;tern Chri&s;tendom. By whom the&s;e were fir&s;t impo&s;ed, authors &s;omewhat dif|fer.

Virgil mentions it as demanded for &s;upport of the Pope's grandeur, and that it was one of the faire&s;t flowers in the triple crown. The payment of the&s;e, with other great &s;ums, &s;o &s;trangely impoveri&s;hed the kingdom, that, notwith&s;tanding the pretence of di|vine right, the Kings of England were obliged to for|bid payment, and King Edward III. di&s;charged the Pope's nuncio from collecting it. The Pope finding how ju&s;tly the Engli&s;h complained of their burdens, receded from the demand for &s;ome time; and Pope Urban<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pol.

This project &s;er|ved to inure the people to the payment of it, and to win the favour of the King.

<P>The &s;tatute of the 25th of Henry VIII. begins with reciting, how the &s;ubjects of this realm had for many years been greatly decayed and impoveri&s;hed by into|lerable exactions of great &s;ums of money taken and claimed by the bi&s;hop of Rome, as well in <HI>pen&s;ions, fees, Peter-pence, procurations, fir&s;t-fruits, &s;uits</HI> for <HI>provi|&s;ions,</HI> and <HI>expeditions</HI> of <HI>bulls,</HI> for <HI>archbi&s;hoprics</HI> and <HI>bi|&s;hoprics,</HI> and for <HI>delegacies</HI> and <HI>re&s;cripts</HI> in <HI>cau&s;es of con|tentions</HI> and <HI>appeals, juri&s;dictions, legantine di&s;pen&s;ations, licences, faculties, grants, relaxations, writs of per$i$de valere, rehabiliations, abolitions,</HI> and other infinite &s;orts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as the words of the &s;tatute are<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Stat. 25. cap. 21.</NOTE>, of which the mo&s;t remarkable demand &s;ome account to be given of them; their nature and origin, and whatever other circum&s;tances appear peculiar and extraordinary, with|out
<PB N="40" REF="45">the tedious enumeration of facts, with their cir|cum&s;tances con&s;equent thereto. We &s;hall begin with <HI>Legantine levies.</HI> The&s;e were &s;ums of money exacted and levied upon the King's &s;ubjects throughout the whole kingdom, by legates and officers appointed by the Pope for that purpo&s;e<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Matth. Paris, Polychron, &amp;c.</NOTE>; and the&s;e were called for as often as the Popes pretended a need of them; for the court of Rome did inculcate, and would have the world to believe, that, being a mother, &s;he ought to be relieved by her children<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hen. de Knighton, coll. 2489.</NOTE>. The fir&s;t extraordinary contribution rai&s;ed for the Pope in this kingdom ap|pears to have been about the year 1183, when Pope Lucius III. having &s;ome quarrel with the citizens of Rome, &s;ent to King Henry II. and his clergy, upon con&s;ultation held pur&s;uant thereto, it was agreed, that it &s;hould be granted as an aid in the King's name only, le&s;t it &s;hould introduce a cu&s;tom that might hereafter prove detrimental to the kingdom; to which council the King adhered, and &s;ent a great aid to the Pope in gold and &s;ilver. This regard paid by his Maje&s;ty to the &s;entiments of the clergy was the more nece&s;&s;ary, as the Popes had frequently been tampering with them; and in the reign of Edward I. he prohibited the clergy from giving any thing to the King, without leave fir&s;t obtained from him<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matth. Paris, fol. 361.</NOTE>. But, notwith&s;tand|ing the before-mentioned caution, the Popes afterwards gained much upon the clergy, though the King and parliament di&s;approved of it; for Pope Gregory IX. A. D. 1229, demanded a tenth of the moveables both of clergy and laity, to which the lords did not con|&s;ent, but the clergy in general paid it; and eleven years after he demanded a fifth part of the goods of the clergy. This occa&s;ioned a demur; and yet, thro' the weakne&s;s of the King, and the private views of
<PB N="41" REF="46">the archbi&s;hop, it was complied with<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. Paris, an. 1240. fol. 536.</NOTE>, which al&s;o oc|ca&s;ioned a complaint the year following, that there re|mained not &s;o much trea&s;ure in the kingdom as had in three years been extorted from it, the ve&s;&s;els and orna|ments of the churches excepted. But notwith&s;tand|ing that reluctancy, and the notable remon&s;trance pre|ferred in the council of Lions, 1245, from the body of the kingdom, and likewi&s;e to the Pope him&s;elf the year after, Pope Innocent IV. invented a new way of charging every religious hou&s;e to furni&s;h a number of &s;oldiers for his &s;ervice, and to fight for the church|militant. About the &s;ame time, the Pope claimed as his right to be heir to every clerk that died inte&s;tate. He afterwards demanded 11,000 marks from the cler|gy as a free gift, as an addition to 6000 he had received the year before, A. D. 1302, from which time the Popes &s;eemed to &s;tudy methods to impoveri&s;h the Eng|li&s;h clergy. About the &s;ame time commenced tho&s;e grievous exactions in Ireland, demanded as a &s;ub&s;idy to Rome for three years by Pope Boniface VIII<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Annals of Ireland, in Camb. Brit. fol. 163</NOTE>. Neither did our Hyperborean neighbours e&s;cape &s;cot-free in this deluge of exactions; nay, no le&s;s there would &s;atisfy the Pope than the whole kingdom, Bo|niface VIII. demanding the whole kingdom as a part of St. Peter's patrimony again&s;t King Edward I. and &s;ent his bull of demand to the King for that purpo&s;e<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Tho. Wal&s;ingham's Hi&s;t. fol. 48. and Fox's Hi&s;t. of Edw. I. fol. 47. Pol. Virgil, Matt. Paris, &amp;c. and in the Tower records.</NOTE>. All this while the poor clergy were oppre&s;&s;ed by the unlimited avarice of the Pope.</P>
<P><HI>King John's Pen&s;ion</HI> may next de&s;erve notice, in who&s;e trouble&s;ome reign the Pope appeared &s;ometimes for, and at other times again&s;t: but once taking ad|vantage of the King's exigence, the King was wrought upon to &s;urrender the crown to Pandulf, the Pope's legate and &s;ub&s;titute; laying the &s;ame, with his &s;cep|ter,
<PB N="42" REF="47">robe, &s;word, and ring, the royal en&s;igns, at his feet; &s;ub&s;cribing al&s;o to a charter, whereby he &s;ur|rendered his kingdom to the Pope, and profe&s;&s;ing, that thenceforward he would hold the crown as feuda|tory to the Pope, and pay an annual tribute, or pen|&s;ion of one thou&s;and marks, for both his kingdoms of England and Ireland. With this charter, and ten thou&s;and pounds in hand, Pandulf goes with triumph to Rome. The annual payment was afterwards &s;uper|&s;eded by parliament, as an act contrary to his oath at his coronation, and the a&s;&s;ent of his parliament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Speed's Chron.</NOTE>. In the year 1276, Pope John &s;ent another bull or demand to King Edward I. whereby he demanded the arrears of one thou&s;and marks, for &s;even years then la&s;t pa&s;t, and al&s;o for that year; whether paid or not is uncer|tain, only &s;ometimes a pre&s;ent from an ea&s;y prince.</P>
<P><HI>Appeals</HI> to the court of Rome was another way of drawing great &s;ums out of England; and the&s;e be|gan mo&s;t con&s;iderably in the reign of King Stephen. The Pope no &s;ooner ta&s;ted the &s;weets of his gains accruing this way, than all encouragement was given to appellants; &s;o that about this time, &s;carce any con|trover&s;y of value, but one party or other would pre|&s;ently appeal to the Pope and court of Rome; for the management of which appeals, it was nece&s;&s;ary to re|tain proctors, notaries, advocates, agents, &s;olicitors, who mu&s;t all be paid here in England: and at the court of Rome were continually re&s;ident a multitude of officers, judges, clerks, &s;ecretaries, advocates, canoni&s;ts, civilians, referendaries, who mu&s;t all have their fees for bulls, breves, citations, commi&s;&s;ions, &s;entences, references, expeditions, &amp;c.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt.

<P><HI>Di&s;pen&s;ations</HI> and <HI>Ab&s;olutions</HI> from ca&s;es re&s;erved and faculties, were another great means of drawing va&s;t
<PB N="43" REF="48">&s;ums of money hence to Rome: and for the managing and di&s;pen&s;ing of the&s;e, the Popes had their mini&s;ters, officers, and courts ready to make out, and grant the&s;e di&s;pen&s;ations, to &s;uch as had occa&s;ion for them, or plea&s;ed to purcha&s;e them, in a multitude of ca&s;es; as for di&s;pen&s;ing with a prelate holding two bi&s;hopricks or plurality of benefices; to make infants capable of benefices and offices; to legitimate ba&s;tards; to qua|lify per&s;ons to marry within the degrees prohibited by the canons, or laws of God; to lay a&s;ide habits of profe&s;&s;ions, regular to revert to a &s;ecular &s;tate; to give liberty to live without rules, order, and di&s;cipline, which had been entered into; for liberty not to keep ra&s;h or prejudicial oaths; to eat fle&s;h at times ordi|narily forbidden; to wave the performances of vows; to re&s;cind contracts, marriages, and covenants, of which innumerable in&s;tances<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Matt.

D. 1246.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Indulgences</HI> and <HI>Pardons</HI> was another &s;ucce&s;sful device to draw money to Rome. This indulgence in the Romi&s;h church, is, they &s;ay, effected by the applica|tion of the merits of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and his &s;aints, by the medium and method of the church, and even ap|plicable to the &s;ouls of the dead, who are in purgatory. This is called <HI>The&s;aurus Eccle&s;iae,</HI> the Trea&s;ure of the Church; and, by the authority of the Pope, par|don is granted for fifty thou&s;and years: and, among&s;t the articles framed by the council of Trent, this is one, that the power of indulgences was left by Chri&s;t in the church, and that the u&s;e thereof is mo&s;t u&s;eful for Chri&s;t's people. A large account of the liberality and readine&s;s of the Popes in granting the&s;e indul|gences and pardons, are recited in an old book, called, <HI>The Cu&s;toms of London:</HI> and we &s;hall therefore only add,
<PB N="44" REF="49">that the Pope, on receiving a valuable con&s;ideration, granted to the &s;everal bi&s;hops of the re&s;pective dioce&s;es in England, authority for the increa&s;e and furtherance of this privilege, as it was called, to any who were weak enough to purcha&s;e for any number of days or months.</P>
<P><HI>Reliques,</HI> &amp;c. came next in play. Agnus Dei's, cro&s;&s;es, pictures, beads, &s;words, bracelets, feathers, ro&s;es, &s;hoes, boots, parings of nails, drops of milk, drops of blood, hair, medals, a&s;hes, du&s;t, chips, con&s;ecrated wax, and innumerable other hallowed knacks, were con&s;tantly imported and &s;old to the devotes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camb.

<P><HI>Jubilees, pilgrimages,</HI> vows, &amp;c. and confluences to Rome, both at &s;tated and arbitrary times, was another &s;ource for enriching Rome. The original of the&s;e ju|bilees in the church of Rome appears to have com|menced in the time of Boniface VIII. who in&s;tituted the fir&s;t jubilee in 1300, promi&s;ing the remi&s;&s;ion of all their &s;ins, to all &s;uch as &s;hould that year vi&s;it the &s;teps a&s;cending to the high altar in St. Peter's church at Rome, and this was to be ob&s;erved every hundred years; at which &s;olemnity there was &s;uch a confluence of people, that the city could &s;carce hold them. Af|ter this, Pope Clement VI. put the time &s;horter, and ordered a jubilee to be celebrated every fiftieth year, A. D. 1350. But Pope Sixtus IV. out of compa&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e weak minds, who might long for a jubilee, ap|pointed it to be kept every twenty-fifth year, and be|gan it in the year 1475. Pope Alexander intended to accommodate the grace and favour to all that would purcha&s;e it, and accordingly, in 1500, he commi&s;&s;i|oned and &s;ent over to England Ja&s;per Pons<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lord Bacon's Hi&s;t. of Henry VII. f. 199.</NOTE>, who conducted this farce with &s;uch &s;olemnity, as to be ge|nerally received and purcha&s;ed on the Pope's terms.

<P><HI>Courts</HI> and <HI>juri&s;dictions</HI> of the Pope, both at Rome and within this kingdom, drew con&s;tantly incredible &s;ums of money to the Pope: the&s;e courts had a great variety of officers, all &s;upported by large fees. The&s;e

By tho&s;e amba&s;&s;adors and agents, pre&s;ents were often made to the Pope. King Henry VIII. A.

<P><HI>Benefices be&s;towed upon foreigners,</HI> commonly Italians, was another artifice of the Pope.

<P><HI>Priories-alien</HI> was another &s;ource of revenue to the Pope; the original of which was, that, according to the direction of the times, many foreign mona&s;teries were endowed with po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions here in England, and then the monks beyond &s;ea would build a cell or con|vent, to which they &s;ent over &s;uch members as they though fit, and con&s;tituted priors over them &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively, and thereupon were called priories-aliens; and as the&s;e increa&s;ed, we find in the reign of Edward III. one hundred and ten of the&s;e in England. In&s;tances may be made of the multitude more of the like foun|dations, all tending to carry money out of the king|dom, and generally to the enemies of Great Britain; and this was found productive of &s;o much mi&s;chief, that there was an act made<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rot.

<P>The orders of the knights templars and ho&s;pitallers were al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of large revenues and lands here, a great part of the profit whereof was tran&s;ported away and &s;pent out of the kingdom.</P>
<P>For the original rule and nature of the&s;e orders, we may refer the curious reader to Dugdale's hi&s;tory<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dugdale's Hi&s;tory of Warwick&s;hire, fol. 704.</NOTE>; it may &s;uffice for our purpo&s;e, that in the year 1307, by the King's &s;pecial command, and bull from the Pope, the templars were generally throughout the kingdom (charged with inciting and &s;tirring up to a rebellion<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham's Hi&s;tory, p. 73.

<P>The <HI>election</HI> and making of <HI>Popes</HI> and <HI>Cardinals,</HI> was another means of carrying great &s;ums frequently out of England to Rome; and that upon this account: The Pope being both a &s;piritual monarch and a tempo|ral prince, that &s;way which he bore in the con&s;ciences of &s;uch as owned his authority, gave him a great in|fluence in the affairs of Chri&s;tendom, be&s;ides his chal|lenging a power to depo&s;e Kings, ab&s;olve &s;ubjects of their oaths of allegiance, di&s;pen&s;e with vows and oaths, and di&s;po&s;e of kingdoms and &s;tates as he plea&s;ed. Be&s;ides the kings and &s;tates of Europe acting accord|ing to their re&s;pective rules of &s;tate and policy, there continually happened a reciprocation and recurrence of
<PB N="51" REF="56">treaties, leagues, alliances, quarrels and wars among&s;t them; and the popedom being elective, all tho&s;e princes and &s;tates (among&s;t whom our Kings had their proper concern) made it their intere&s;t and utmo&s;t en|deavour, in a vacancy, to procure the promotion of &s;uch a one to that &s;ee, as might be favourable to their particular intere&s;ts and de&s;igns; and from hence many &s;uitable contrivances, unravelling intere&s;ts and func|tions, canva&s;&s;ing parties, purcha&s;ing intelligence, buy|ing votes, bribing of officers, and any thing el&s;e that would carry their point, and could be purcha&s;ed, the expence was not &s;pared; nor was all the expence con|fined for election of the Pope only, but for other pro|motions prior to the obtaining of that dignity. Ambi|tion is rooted in the nature of all men, and e&s;pecially in per&s;ons of that order. Some in&s;tances are too remark|able to be omitted. H. Beaufort, Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, in the reign of Henry V. ama&s;&s;ed 300,000 pounds, of which he lent the King 200,000 pounds, and took his crown to pawn for it, and with a good part of the re&s;t purcha&s;ed a cardinal&s;hip, but did not live to pur|cha&s;e the papacy; and in the reign of Henry VIII. the great and rich Wool&s;ey was never quiet, always bribing one or other to get to the popedom; but the &s;uperior advantages of &s;ome, as being nearer, to watch all opportunities, or bribing higher, the Cardi|nal, after great expence, failed of obtaining his point; and it is ju&s;tly remarked in hi&s;tory, that few of the Engli&s;h were advanced to the dignity, notwith&s;tand|ing they were generous contributors to its &s;upport.</P>
<P><HI>Canonization,</HI> and <HI>&s;ainting</HI> of men, women and boys, was another method of gain to the Popes; and that was when any per&s;on lived more au&s;terely or devoutly than ordinary, or was famed for any miracle pretended to have been done by him in his lifetime, or by his reliques, or at his tomb after his death; or that he died for, or in defence of the truth, or the church's cau&s;e; then if his &s;urviving friends or relations made
<PB N="52" REF="57">application to the Pope, upon payment of good &s;ums, according to the abilities and qualities of the per&s;on &s;oliciting for &s;entences, fees, orders, references, and other things requi&s;ite in &s;uch ca&s;es, the party, by a kind of <HI>apotheo&s;is,</HI> was made a &s;aint, and a place a&s;&s;igned him in the calendar. Of this extraction was the famous St. Cuthbert, St. Dun&s;tan, St. Thomas of Canterbury, St. Winifred, and many others, who for money had their names put into the rolls of glory, and their fames and merits celebrated, and &s;upplicated here on earth. The manner of canonizations, with the ordinary charges, too long to be here in&s;erted, you may find in Sir Henry Spelman, in his &s;econd tome of his collection of the Engli&s;h councils.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides the Pope's legates, who were the general collectors for the Pope, there was another &s;et of men came over into England, A. D. 1$35, who were very a&s;&s;iduous in improving the Pope's revenues, and in tran&s;mitting the money; and the&s;e were called <HI>Caur&s;ins</HI> and <HI>Lombards,</HI> Italians by country, and &s;tiled them|&s;elves the Pope's merchants. The&s;e drove the trade of letting out of money, of which they had what may be called a bank-&s;tock, and were e&s;teemed more &s;evere and mercile&s;s than the Jews. <HI>Matthew Paris</HI> gives us the etymology of the word Caur&s;ins, <HI>qua&s;i capientes &amp; ur|&s;ini,</HI> becau&s;e they worried men like bea$s. Now, be|cau&s;e the Pope's legates and collectors were all for ready money, when any &s;um by levy, fir&s;t fruits, tenths, di&s;pen&s;ations, &amp;c. became due and payable to the Pope, by any prelate, covent, prie&s;t or lay per&s;on, the&s;e Caur&s;ins would furni&s;h them with ready ca&s;h, upon their entering into a &s;olemn bond and obligation for that purpo&s;e, the form of which in Engli&s;h was as follows: To all that &s;ee this pre&s;ent writing, Thomas the prior and the convent of Barnwell, greeting, and know ye, that we have borrowed and received at Lon|don, for our&s;elves, and profitably to be expended for us and our hou&s;e, from Franci&s;co and Gregorio, for

<P>In the year A. D. 1261, there was a provincial council held at Lambeth, wherein the con&s;titutions of that &s;ynod were a confirmation, or illu&s;tration, of tho&s;e before made in the a&s;&s;embly of Morton. Both of them carried the privileges of the church too high, and bore too hard upon the common law in &s;undry in|&s;tances. This made the King unea&s;y: however, he did not think it proper to refer the controver&s;y to his own courts, but applied to the Pope for a remedy. In his letter he informed the Pope, that the reverend fathers, Boniface, Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and his &s;uffragans, had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;ynodical decrees in pre|judice of his crown and kingdom, and therefore de&s;ires his Holine&s;s would revoke the&s;e con&s;titutions. This letter was addre&s;&s;ed to Pope Urban IV. and dated
<PB N="56" REF="61">October 23, 1261. The Pope, as it appears, was &s;ilent about two years; after which time he vouch|&s;afes to &s;end the King an an&s;wer to his reque&s;t. In this letter he takes notice, that the church of England had &s;uffered great hard&s;hips by the mal-admini&s;tration of the King's mini&s;ters of ju&s;tice; and that to provide again&s;t the&s;e encroachments, the Archbi&s;hop, and his &s;uffragans, had pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal canons and able con&s;titu|tions in defence of their liberties; and that they having &s;ince made application to the holy &s;ee to confirm their provincial &s;ynod, the&s;e decrees had, for the mo&s;t part, been confirmed, and he could not now pretend to make alterations; but de&s;ired the King would be tender of the privileges of the church, and forbid his mini&s;ters incroaching upon them.</P>

<P>But notwith&s;tanding many of tho&s;e canons relate to the good order and di&s;cipline of the churches, Mr. Fox relates, that a little before King Henry's death there fell out a grand controver&s;y between the monks and citizens of Norwich, about certain talliages and li|berties; that, after much altercation and wrangling words, the rage of the city &s;o much increa&s;ed, that they &s;et upon the abbey and priory, and burned both the church and the Bi&s;hop's palace; which King Henry afterwards brought them to trial for, and many of them &s;uffered cruel deaths; others were excommunicated.
<PB N="57" REF="62">The city was likewi&s;e obliged to find money towards re-edifying the church and the palace. Afterwards he returned to London, where he fell grievou&s;ly &s;ick, and expired in a few days, after reigning fifty-&s;ix years.</P>
<P>King Henry died A. D. 1272, of whom Speed gives this &s;hort character, that his devotion was greater than his di&s;cretion, as was evident from the injuries he &s;uf|fered him&s;elf, and the depredation of his kingdom by popi&s;h &s;way. Dr. Smollet &s;ays, the particulars of his character may be gathered from the detail of his con|duct. He was certainly a Prince of very mean talents, irre&s;olute, incon&s;tant, and capricious, proud, in&s;olent, and arbitrary, arrogant in pro&s;perity, and abject in adver&s;ity, profu&s;e, rapacious, and choleric, though de&s;titute of liberality, oeconomy, and courage: yet his continence was prai&s;e-worthy, as well as his aver&s;ion to cruelty; for he contented him&s;elf with puni&s;hing even rebels in their effects only, when he might have glutted his revenge with their blood. He was prodigal even to exce&s;s, and therefore always in nece&s;&s;ity, notwith|&s;tanding the great &s;ums he levied from his &s;ubjects; and tho' his occa&s;ions were never &s;o pre&s;&s;ing, he could not help &s;quandering away his money upon worthle&s;s foreign favourites, without con&s;idering the difficulty he always found in obtaining &s;upplies from par|liament</P>

<HEAD>EDWARD I. A. D. 1272.</HEAD>
<P>Though Henry's death happened at a &s;eeming un|favourable conjuncture, when the heir of the crown was ab&s;ent, and Richard King of the Romans, with his &s;on, were now no more; Walter Gifford, Arch|bi&s;hop of York, and the Lords of the Council, ma|naged affairs with &s;uch di&s;cretion, that no bad con&s;e|quences en&s;ued. On the morning after the King's death, Edward was proclaimed at We&s;tmin&s;ter, and
<PB N="58" REF="63">afterwards in Guildhall; and all per&s;ons enjoined to keep the peace towards the Jews, as well as the Chri&s;tians; for at this time there were great di&s;tur|bances happened, to the annoyance of the public peace. To prevent, as far as po&s;&s;ible, any in&s;urrection or matter for rebellion, the nobility of Ireland, together with all the nobility of this land, took the oaths of allegiance to Edward; for the former of which, a &s;pe|cial commi&s;&s;ion was appointed and &s;ent over.</P>
<P>A. D. 1273, the King vi&s;ited Rome, in con&s;equence of an invitation from Gregory X. and this Pontiff now indulged him with the grant of two or three tenths of all eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues throughout his kingdom, to reimbur&s;e him for the expences of his expedition to Pale&s;tine, where the King had attended him.</P>
<P>Upon his return to England, that he might take more effectual methods for the honour and tranquillity of his reign, he appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to examine into the &s;tate of his own revenues; appointed Com|mi&s;&s;ioners of Inque&s;t, to make a progre&s;s thro' all the counties of the kingdom, and not only take an exact information of every circum&s;tance relating to the crown fiefs, but al&s;o puni&s;h the malver&s;ation of Magi&s;trates and Sheriffs, who had lately abu&s;ed their authority, and oppre&s;&s;ed their fellow &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>That he might the better protect his people from &s;uch extortion, he &s;ummoned a general parliament, in which &s;everal excellent laws were enacted for the ea&s;e and advantage of the &s;ubjects; who were &s;o well plea&s;ed with all the regulations, that they granted a fifteenth of all their moveables, to pay the debts which the King had contracted in his expedition to the Holy Land. The merchants, out of gratitude for the great care he had taken of their intere&s;ts in a treaty with Flanders, de&s;ired that a tax might be laid on every &s;ack of wool, and twice as much upon every three hundred &s;kins, and a la&s;t of leather, for the King's own u&s;e, and his heirs for ever, known by the name of the
<PB N="59" REF="64"><HI>New Cu&s;tom,</HI> in contradi&s;tinction to that which had been formerly paid; and is &s;aid to have been granted by the prelates and nobility, as well as by the mer|chants of the kingdom. Towards the latter end of the late reign, the Jews had, by bribing the King's Coun|cil, been admitted to all the privileges of Chri&s;tian na|tives: they purcha&s;ed hou&s;es, lands, and manors; &s;at on juries, enjoyed &s;ei&s;in and ward&s;hips of Chri&s;tian heirs, together with the right of pre&s;entation to livings. This indulgence rai&s;ed a clamour among the clergy, and gave great offence to all &s;orts of people. The King him&s;elf was &s;hocked at the &s;candalous connivance of his father in this particular, and at his de&s;ire a law was made in this parliament, rendering Jews incapable of holding fee or freehold, obliging them to wear a mark on their outward garments, to di&s;tingui&s;h them from Chri&s;tians, and prohibiting them, on &s;evere penalties, from lending money at u&s;ury.</P>
<P>The Pope likewi&s;e demanded eight thou&s;and marks, as the arrears of the annual tribute,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A. D. 1276.</NOTE> which were paid accordingly. Though Edward was a&s;hamed of this vile acknowledgment, and af|terwards propo&s;ed to Pope Nicholas III. that, in&s;tead of being i&s;&s;ued from the exchequer, it might be charged upon &s;ome abbeys and priories, which he would endow for that purpo&s;e; but the Pope perceiving his drift, would not hearken to the propo&s;al, by which he might invalidate a claim to more important demands, when a proper opportunity &s;hould occur.</P>
<P>Great complaints had been made of the exce&s;|&s;ive wealth of the clergy and convents,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A. D. 1279.</NOTE> which daily increa&s;ed, to the prejudice of the laity, and indeed of the nation in general: though care had been taken to in&s;ert in the famous charter of King John, a clau&s;e, expre&s;sly forbidding the &s;ubjects to alienate their lands in favour of the church. This ar|ticle had been entirely neglected; and now the abu&s;e was become &s;o dangerous, that the King plainly &s;aw,

<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE">
<PB N="60" REF="67">the church mu&s;t in time engro&s;s all the lands of the kingdom, unle&s;s &s;ome remedy could be found for this growing evil. Edward a&s;&s;embled a parliament, to whom he explained his &s;entiments on this &s;ubject; ob|&s;erving, that as the church neither died nor alienated, all their lands would be &s;wallowed up in that gulph, from which they could never emerge: he therefore de&s;ired they would deliberate maturely, and find out &s;ome remedy for a grievance of &s;uch importance. This propo&s;al was joyfully received by the a&s;&s;embly; and the famous &s;tatute of mortmain enacted, forbidding all per&s;ons whatever to di&s;po&s;e of their effects, in favour of religious &s;ocieties, without the expre&s;s permi&s;&s;ion of the King or Lord of the fief.</P>
<P>At home he made a progre&s;s through the different counties, to hear the complaints, and redre&s;s the grie|vances of his &s;ubjects; but, in the cour&s;e of the&s;e re|gulations, he took one &s;tep which might have produced infinite mi&s;chief to the kingdom. During the late troubles, &s;everal people had u&s;urped lands, to which they had no lawful title, and the crown had &s;uffered by the&s;e appropriations: in order to reform this abu&s;e, the parliament, a&s;&s;embled in the cour&s;e of this year, enacted a &s;tatute, called Quo Warranto, obliging all landholders to produce their charters and titles before &s;uch judges as &s;hould be appointed to examine their validity. This was a very ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary regulation, which, however, the King abu&s;ed for the gratification of his avarice. He knew, that, among the tenants of the crown, there was a good number of landholders who had lo&s;t their titles, and he re&s;olved to take ad|vantage of their misfortune, on pretence of executing this &s;tatute of Quo Warranto. He publi&s;hed a pro|clamation, commanding all tho&s;e who held lands of the crown, to produce their titles before the judges of the kingdom; an order which was looked upon as the &s;ource of infinite mi&s;chief and oppre&s;&s;ion. Accordingly tho&s;e who were fir&s;t que&s;tioned, and could not produce
<PB N="61" REF="68">original titles, although they pleaded long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, found them&s;elves obliged to pay large &s;ums to the King for the pre&s;ervation of their e&s;tates. But the progre&s;s of this evil was &s;topped by the re&s;olution of the Earl of Warrene, who being required by the judges to produce his charter, un&s;heathed an old ru&s;ty &s;word, as the in&s;trument by which his ance&s;tors had acquired their land, and with which he re&s;olved to pre&s;erve them to the la&s;t drop of his blood. This bold an&s;wer gave Edward to under&s;tand, that his inqui&s;ition would be attended with very dangerous con&s;equences; and, that the &s;pirit of independence which breathed defiance to his father, was not yet extingui&s;hed in the nation. Moved by the&s;e con&s;iderations, he revoked his pro|clamation; and the joy manife&s;ted on this occa&s;ion plainly denoted how deeply they had felt the inju&s;tice of the inquiry.</P>
<P>Edward was &s;o much engro&s;&s;ed by his &s;chemes on the continent,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A. D. 1288.</NOTE> that he &s;eemed to look upon England as a &s;econdary con&s;ideration: he had now re&s;ided in Guienne about three years, during which he had expended con&s;iderable &s;ums of Engli&s;h money upon the continent. At length his finances being exhau&s;ted, he ordered the Bi&s;hop of Ely his trea&s;urer to demand a &s;ub&s;idy; and a parliament and a great council of the nobility being a&s;&s;embled at We&s;tmin&s;ter, he &s;ignified the King's plea&s;ure; but the Earl of Glouce&s;ter, in the name of the re&s;t, declared they would not grant a &s;ub&s;idy while the King con|tinued abroad; &s;o that he was obliged to rai&s;e money, in the pre&s;ent exigency, by laying a talliage on all the cities, towns and manors, of the crown deme&s;nes.</P>
<P>Edward, who had ju&s;t con&s;ummated his nup|tials with Margaret of France,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A. D. 1299.</NOTE> in con&s;equence of the treaty, no &s;ooner heard of the&s;e commotions, than he i&s;&s;ued orders for a&s;&s;embling the troops of the northern counties, and &s;ummoned a parliament at York, to meet in November, where he under&s;tood that the ca&s;tle
<PB N="62" REF="69">of Stirling was reduced to extremity. He re&s;olved forthwith to march to the relief of that fortre&s;s; but, when he had proceeded as far as Berwick, the nobility refu&s;ed to &s;erve on the expedition, alledging that the roads of Scotland were unpa&s;&s;able in that &s;ea&s;on of the year. Thus hampered, he was obliged to de&s;i&s;t from the enterprize, and allow the garri&s;on the be&s;t capitulation they could obtain. He re&s;olved, how|ever, to make &s;uch an enterprize for invading Scotland in the &s;ummer, as would &s;ave him the trouble of a winter-campaign for the future. Mean while, he in this parliament confirmed the two charters, and the &s;heriffs over all England were ordered to publi&s;h them in the county-courts every quarter. It was enacted, that three knights &s;hould be cho&s;en by the freeholders in every county-court, to enforce the execution of the&s;e charters, and puni&s;h tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors in a &s;ummary way, without the tedious forms of the common law. The &s;tatute of Winton was likewi&s;e confirmed; and a new law made, under the title of <HI>Articuli &s;uper Chartas,</HI> enact|ing, that no goods or merchandize &s;hould be taken without payment, by the King's order, except &s;uch as might be nece&s;&s;ary for his hou&s;hold or wardrobe. This &s;tatute likewi&s;e contained &s;ome regulations with regard to tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, contracts, debts of pleas within the verge of the court; and provided redre&s;s again&s;t fal&s;e entries, &s;eizures, and wa&s;te, committed by e&s;chea|tors. Writs were i&s;&s;ued for fini&s;hing the preambula|tions of the fore&s;ts, that their bounds might be a&s;|certained for ever; and all the adulterated pennies, of which a va&s;t number had been imported into the kingdom, was cried down by proclamation.</P>
<P>The King having taken the&s;e mea&s;ures for the be|nefit of his &s;ubjects, began to prepare for the final de&s;truction of Scotland; and, a&s;&s;embling a numerous army, took the field about Mid&s;ummer. As &s;oon as he entered Galloway, he received a propo&s;al from the Scotti&s;h nobility, importing that they would lay down
<PB N="63" REF="70">their arms, and &s;ubmit, on condition that he would &s;et their King at liberty, and allow them to ran&s;om their e&s;tates, which he had given away; otherwi&s;e they would defend them&s;elves to the la&s;t extremity. Their reque&s;ts being rejected with di&s;dain,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A. D. 1300.</NOTE> they a&s;&s;embled a great number of men, without arms or di&s;cipline, in hope of finding &s;ome opportu|nity to &s;urpri&s;e him in his march; but he proceeded with &s;uch circum&s;pection as baffled all their endea|vours; and pur&s;ued them &s;o clo&s;ely, that they were at la&s;t obliged to &s;tand a battle, in which they were immediately routed, though not with great &s;laughter; for they fled into fa&s;tne&s;&s;es, through which they could not be pur&s;ued by heavy-armed troops, unacquainted with the &s;ituation of the country. The hopes they had repo&s;ed in their own valour being utterly bla&s;ted by this overthrow, they &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to implore the protection of Pope Boniface, and offer him the &s;o|vereignty of the kingdom. That ambitious pontiff embraced the propo&s;al without he&s;itation, and order|ing a bull to be expedited on the &s;ubject, &s;ent it im|mediately with a letter to Archbi&s;hop Winchel&s;ey, directing him to deliver it into the hands of Edward without delay. The prelate no &s;ooner received this mandate of his Holine&s;s, than he &s;et out in per&s;on for Galloway, and found his Maje&s;ty in the abbey of Du&s;ques, where he received the papal claim with equal &s;urpri&s;e and indignation. The bull contained a great number of arguments to invalidate the preten|&s;ions of Edward to the &s;overeignty of Scotland; re|proached him with the cruelties he had committed in the pro&s;ecution of the war again&s;t that unfortunate country; and, in particular, with his having impri&s;oned divers bi&s;hops &s;till in confinement: it con&s;tituted the Pope as the proper judge of the difference between the Engli&s;h and Scotti&s;h nations; and ordered the King to &s;end amba&s;&s;adors to Rome with proper in&s;tructions, within the term of &s;ix months; at the expiration of
<PB N="64" REF="71">which he would pronounce a definitive &s;entence. Shocked, as a prince of Edward's haughty di&s;po&s;ition mu&s;t have been at this in&s;olent addre&s;s, he knew his intere&s;t too well to engage in a quarrel with the Pope, at a time when Guienne was &s;eque&s;tered in the hands of that pontiff. Indeed, when he fir&s;t peru&s;ed the con|tents, he &s;wore, in a tran&s;port of anger, that if the Pope per&s;i&s;ted in &s;uch preten&s;ions, he would de&s;troy Scotland from &s;ea to &s;ea; and the Scotti&s;h deputies who were pre&s;ent, could not hear &s;uch a menace without emotion. They told him he would find that work more difficult than he imagined; for there was not a Scot in the kingdom who would not &s;pend the la&s;t drop of his blood in defence of his country. This declara|tion was not a little extraordinary, con&s;idering the per|fidy with which they had betrayed one another &s;ince the beginning of the war. The King's indignation gave way to his policy. He amu&s;ed the Archbi&s;hop with a general an&s;wer, implying, that as it was an affair which concerned the rights of the Engli&s;h crown, he could not make a proper reply until he &s;hould have con&s;ulted his parliament; but, as a proof of his regard for his Holine&s;s, he ordered the Bi&s;hop of Gla&s;|gow to be &s;et at liberty; returned to England, where he di&s;banded his forces; and, at the reque&s;t of the French King, con&s;ented to a truce with the Scots until Whit&s;untide of the en&s;uing year.</P>
<P>That Edward was extremely alarmed by this ex|travagant demand of Boniface, appears from the pains he took to invalidate his preten&s;ions. He convoked a parliament at Lincoln in the beginning of the year, to con&s;ult with them upon this extraordinary affair, and deliberate upon a proper an&s;wer to his Holine&s;s. After &s;ome debates,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A D. 1301.</NOTE> it was re&s;olved that a letter &s;hould be written to the Pope, in the name of the barons of England, to this effect: That the crown of England had always enjoyed the right of &s;o|vereignty over Scotland; and it was notoriou&s;ly known,
<PB N="65" REF="72">that Scotland had never depended, with re&s;pect to temporals, on the &s;ee of Rome: that the parliament would never &s;uffer the King to put his right in litiga|tion, or to &s;end amba&s;&s;adors to Rome on this &s;ubject, even if he &s;hould be inclined to exhibit &s;uch proofs of complai&s;ance to his Holine&s;s; they therefore de&s;ired he would not attempt to di&s;turb the King or kingdom, in the enjoyment of their prerogatives. This letter, &s;ub&s;cribed by one hundred barons, was followed by another from the King him&s;elf, accompanied with an ab&s;tract, like that which had been read in the a&s;&s;embly at Norham, to prove that the kingdom of Scotland had always been dependent upon the Engli&s;h crown. But with this difference; that whereas the fir&s;t deduced the pretended right from Edward the Ancient, this writing traced it back to Brutus, the fir&s;t fabulous King of Albion; and brought it down through all the fictitious reigns recorded in the romance compo&s;ed by Geoffrey of Monmouth. Though the&s;e antique fables could have no effect upon the natives of Scotland, he hoped they might make a favourable impre&s;&s;ion upon the Pope and his Italians, who were not &s;o well ver&s;ed in the hi&s;tory of Britain. Edward's letter was couched in very re&s;pectful terms; &s;o that his Holine&s;s could not take exceptions to one expre&s;&s;ion: an in|&s;tance of moderation which could hardly have ap|peared upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, had not the King of England been at the mercy of the Pope, with regard to the re&s;titution of Guienne. Neverthele&s;s, he took care to prote&s;t that he did not mean this as an appeal in a judicial form, but wrote the detail merely with a view to inform the Pope's con&s;cience.</P>
<P>King Edward a&s;&s;embled his fir&s;t parliament after his coronation at We&s;tmin&s;ter, on Ea&s;ter Monday, in the third year of his reign, and made many excellent &s;ta|tutes, &s;ome of them relating to the privileges and ju|ri&s;dictions of the clergy, controlling &s;ome canons of

<P>Soon after the council of Lyons, in concurrence with the Pope, &s;ent the Pope's nuncio into England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, upon &s;undry affairs of the church, e&s;pecially to demand and receive from the King, eight years arrears of the annual tribute and Peter-pence, then due to the church of Rome, which the King de|clined paying.</P>
<P>The abbot and convent of Fever&s;ham being greatly indebted to merchants and others, by their expences at Rome and papal exactions, the King, to pre&s;erve them and their hou&s;e from ruin, took them and all their lands, money and goods, under his protection, and committed them to the management of proper per&s;ons to protect, &s;upport and a&s;&s;i&s;t them, to &s;uper|&s;ede their difficulties: he likewi&s;e granted &s;uch privileges to the abbots and priories of Borde&s;ly, Bindon and Thernholm, and in a few years after did the &s;ame for the abbey of Reading.</P>
<P>The Chancellor and Univer&s;ity of Oxford, having at their proper co&s;ts founded a chapelry in the church of St. Mary, to pray for the &s;afety of the King, his Queen and children, ance&s;tors, and all their benefac|tors; the King, highly commending their piety therein, and endeavouring to promote it, wrote to all the Arch|bi&s;hops and Bi&s;hops of England and Ireland, to grant &s;ome &s;pecial indulgences to all who &s;hould re&s;ort to this chapelry to hear ma&s;s or prayers.</P>
<P>He gave a licence, upon the petition of the dean and chapter of Hereford, to elect a new Bi&s;hop of that dioce&s;e, and to re&s;tore the temporalities to him, after confirmation by the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, without the con&s;ent or knowledge of the Pope.</P>

<P>The King, to advance learning, and for the good of the church, prie&s;thood and commonwealth, gave his royal a&s;&s;ent for tran&s;lating the friers of the ho&s;pital of St. John in Cambridge, into a college of &s;cholars, after the pattern and rules of Merton college.</P>

<P>In the &s;ame year 1290, the King, out of his zeal to the Chri&s;tian religion, bani&s;hed all the Jews out of England, by a public act of parliament, and confi&s;|cated all their hou&s;es and lands, for their infidelity, bla&s;phemy, crucifying of children, in contempt of Chri&s;t crucified; and clipping of his coin. In Augu&s;t they were commanded to depart the land, with their wives and children, between that time and the fea&s;t of All Saints, with their moveable goods.</P>

<P>King Edward &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed Pope Boniface's anti-monarchical con&s;titution, again&s;t demanding or impo&s;ing &s;ub&s;idies on the clergy.

<P>The eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory of this period turns chiefly upon the di&s;putes between the crown of England and the Popes, who, &s;ince the &s;hameful re&s;ignation of King John, had always looked upon this country as a tri|butary kingdom and conquered province, which they had a right to rule and impoveri&s;h. The Engli&s;h people, under the reign of Edward the Fir&s;t, found the Roman yoke &s;o intolerable, that they began to concert mea|&s;ures for redeeming them&s;elves from &s;uch infamous &s;lavery, though not before they had, by repeated com|plaints, repre&s;ented their grievances to the court of Rome, and &s;olicited in vain for redre&s;s. They com|plained of their frequent appeals, that obliged indivi|duals to go and exhau&s;t their time and money in &s;oli|citing
<PB N="70" REF="77">cau&s;es at the court of Rome; and that the Pope had u&s;urped the collation of almo&s;t all the benefices of the kingdom, contrary to the rights of the King, the chapters and patrons. Sometimes his Holine&s;s, from the plenitude of his apo&s;tolic power, re&s;erved to him&s;elf the right of filling all the vacancies, which aro&s;e from tran&s;lation, death of the incumbent, or any other cau&s;e what&s;oever; by which means tho&s;e pontiffs eluded all the canonical elections in England, with|out advancing any other rea&s;on, but that they had re|&s;erved to them&s;elves before-hand the right of filling up the benefice. They had certainly formed the de&s;ign of engro&s;&s;ing, by little and little, the collation to all the eccle&s;ia&s;tical livings in the kingdom; for, when they could not decently pretend to have made &s;uch a re&s;ervation of a right to nominate, they generally found &s;ome objections to the elect, and appointed another in his room: but as tho&s;e who had been canonically elected were always &s;upported by the Kings of England, the Popes found means to evade this oppo&s;ition, in conferring bi&s;hoprics and benefices before they were vacant, by provi&s;ion, which the Engli&s;h people con|&s;idered as an un&s;ufferable grievance. This was the more provoking, as the benefices be&s;towed by the Popes plenitude of power, were generally granted to fo|reigners, cardinals, or their kin&s;men, who, by virtue of a di&s;pen&s;ation, enjoyed the revenues without re&s;iding in the kingdom. The&s;e benefices were generally farmed by people who employed curates at very &s;mall &s;ala|ries; the &s;ervice was neglected, the churches went to ruin, all ho&s;pitality was bani&s;hed, and the practice of in&s;tructing of people in the duties of the Chri&s;tian religion was entirely neglected: be&s;ides the&s;e incon|veniencies, the money was carried out of the king|dom, to the infinite prejudice of the natives; an hard&s;hip that will appear to be the more &s;evere, if we con&s;ider, that in the reign of Henry III. the income which foreign eccle&s;ia&s;tics drew from England exceeded
<PB N="71" REF="78">the royal revenue. The Pope frequently impo&s;ed taxes on the Engli&s;h clergy; &s;ometimes on pretence of cru|&s;ades; &s;ometimes to relieve the nece&s;&s;ities of the holy &s;ee; and often by granting tithes to the King, who gratified his Holine&s;s with a &s;hare of the plunder. The clergy of England were obliged to maintain legates and nuncio's at a great expence, over and above pre|&s;ents and procurations, which they extorted by virtue of the Pope's authority; the annates or fir&s;t-fruits of all benefices were paid to the Roman pontiff; St. Peter's penny was levied with great rigour, and the tribute incurred by King John was con&s;idered as a mo&s;t &s;candalous oppre&s;&s;ion; at the &s;ame time the clergy indu&s;triou&s;ly encroached upon the civil power and pre|rogatives of the Sovereign; they extended their juri&s;|dicton over all matrimonial cau&s;es, they took congni|zance of every di&s;pute, in which religion could any way be intere&s;ted; and in&s;tead of &s;upporting the rights and prerogatives of the crown, they always e&s;pou&s;ed the rights of the Pope, whom they affected to con&s;ider as their only &s;overeign. The&s;e are the principal grievan|ces which the Kings and parliament of England en|deavoured from time to time to redre&s;s, by occa&s;ional &s;tatutes and ordinances, which furni&s;hed the Popes with a pretext to complain in their turn, that the church was in danger, and the cau&s;e of God neglected and betrayed. Pope Clement V. in a bull, in&s;erted among the public acts, enumerates the following cau&s;es of complaint again&s;t the conduct of the Engli&s;h go|vernment. The Cardinals were not allowed to enjoy the prebendaries be&s;towed upon them, as per&s;ons or|dained by God, to bear a &s;hare in the fatigue of the government of the church; though the Pope had in|conte&s;tably the right to confer benefices in England, as well as in other dominions; tho&s;e for whom he pro|vided were not allowed to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, nor to ex|communicate &s;uch as had the pre&s;umption to avail them&s;elves of their right; the citation i&s;&s;ued from
<PB N="72" REF="79">Rome on this &s;ubject were di&s;regarded; notaries were forbid to publi&s;h them, and the natives to an|&s;wer any appeals out of the kingdom; the Pope's nuncio's were prohibited from exerci&s;ing their functions, until they &s;hould have received the King's licence; and &s;ome of them had been confined in public pri&s;ons, from whence they had been obliged to purcha&s;e their relea&s;e, with con&s;iderable &s;ums of money; the magi&s;|trates would not &s;uffer excommunicated per&s;ons to be impri&s;oned, even after forty days allowed them to give &s;atisfaction to the church; the King frequently inhibited eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts from taking cognizance of cau&s;es that properly belonged to their province, and even de|prived them of their juri&s;diction over the members of the clergy, without con&s;idering that eccle&s;ia&s;tics are altogether independent of lay-tribunals; clerks were condemned in lay-courts, even without the con&s;ent of their &s;uperiors; they were obliged to appear in their &s;hirts before their civil tribunals, in defiance of their immunities; and though they were remitted to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, when reclaimed, they were fre|quently acquitted and relea&s;ed by lay-judges, before the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court had taken cognizance of the affair; clerks were acquitted or condemned by juries of lay-men; the nobility of the kingdom frequently oppre&s;&s;ed the abbeys, by lodging in them, at a great expence, under the frivolous pretext, that the mona&s;|teries had been founded by their ance&s;tors; during the vacancy of abbeys, tho&s;e whom the King appointed to take charge of them, damaged the premi&s;&s;es, and wa&s;ted the income; and, finally, the tribute of a thou|&s;and marks, due to the holy &s;ee, was not paid to the Pope, but converted to other u&s;es.</P>
<P>King Edward I. during his long reign, di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf by many martial atchievements, in which it mu&s;t be acknowledged he gained great honour; yet, at the &s;ame time, they turned to &s;o little real advan|tage,
<PB N="73" REF="80">either to him&s;elf or his &s;ubjects, that they &s;eem rather to eclip&s;e than add a lu&s;tre to his character.</P>
<P>When he was drawing near the clo&s;e of his life, there were three points which he had in view to enjoin upon his &s;on. The fir&s;t point he aimed at, was to pro|&s;ecute the war again&s;t the Scots with unremitted vigour, until he &s;hould have reduced them to an entire &s;ubjec|tion; for which purpo&s;e he advi&s;ed him to carry his bones into Scotland, at the head of the army, not doubting but the pre&s;ence even of his lifele&s;s corp&s;e would daunt the courage of a people whom he had &s;o often vanqui&s;hed.</P>
<P>The &s;econd was, that he would &s;end his heart to Jeru&s;alem, with thirty-two thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, which he had de&s;tined for the &s;upport of the holy &s;e|pulchre. And the third, that he would never recall his favourite Gave&s;ton, whom he con&s;idered as the cau&s;e of all the mi&s;demeanours of which the young prince had been guilty, and who, he fore&s;aw, would be the occa&s;ion of far greater mi&s;chiefs, if he &s;hould ever return to England. The Prince having promi&s;ed to obey the&s;e injunctions, Edward re&s;igned to his fate, with a pious, but manly compo&s;ure, and expired in the arms of his &s;ervants.</P>
<P>Thus died Edward I. King of England, on the &s;eventh day of July, after having reigned thirty-four years with great reputation and &s;ucce&s;s. He was a Prince of a very dignified appearance; tall in &s;tature, regular and comely in his features, with keen piercing black eyes, and of an a&s;pect that commanded reve|rence and e&s;teem. His con&s;titution was robu&s;t; his &s;trength and dexterity perhaps unequalled in his king|dom; and his &s;hape was unblemi&s;hed, in all other re&s;pects but that of his legs, which are &s;aid to have been too long in proportion to his body, whence he derived the epithet of Long-&s;hanks. In the qualities of the head, he equalled the greate&s;t Monarchs who have &s;at on the Engli&s;h throne: he was cool, pene|trating,
<PB N="74" REF="81">&s;agacious, and circum&s;pect: the remote&s;t corners of the earth re&s;ounded with the fame of his courage; and all over Europe he was con&s;idered as the flower of chivalry. Nor was he le&s;s con&s;ummate in his legi&s;lative capacity, than eminent for his military prowe&s;s. He may be &s;tiled the Engli&s;h Ju&s;tinian; for be&s;ides the excellent &s;tatutes that were enacted in his reign, he new-modelled the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, &s;o as to render it more &s;ure and &s;ummary; he fixed proper bounds to the different courts of juri&s;diction, &s;ettled a new and ea&s;y method of collecting the revenue, and e&s;tabli&s;hed wi&s;e and effectual regulations for pre|&s;erving peace and order among his &s;ubjects. Yet, with all the&s;e good qualities, he cheri&s;hed a dangerous ambition, to which he did not &s;cruple to &s;acrifice the good of his country; witne&s;s his ruinous war with Scotland, which drained the kingdom of men and money, and gave ri&s;e to rancorous enmity, which in the &s;equel proved &s;o prejudicial to both nations. That he was arbitrary in his di&s;po&s;ition, appears in many in|&s;tances, particularly that of &s;eizing, for his own u&s;e, the merchandize of his &s;ubjects; a &s;tretch of prerogative more &s;uitable to the conduct of an ea&s;tern Emperor, than to that of an Engli&s;h Monarch. The cruelty of his nature was manife&s;t in every expedition he under|took, either in Wales or Scotland. His integrity may be que&s;tioned from the nature of his tran&s;actions with the competitors of the Scotti&s;h crown, and the renun|ciation of the oath he had taken to his &s;ubjects. Tho' he is celebrated for his cha&s;tity and regular deportment, there is not, in the whole cour&s;e of his reign, one in|&s;tance of liberality or munificence. He had great abi|lities, but no genius; and was an accompli&s;hed war|tior, without the lea&s;t &s;park of heroi&s;m<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Smollett.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>EDWARD II. <HI>&s;urnamed of</HI> Caernarvon, A. D. 1307.</HEAD>
<P>The reign of the late King had been productive of great advantage, and greater glory, to the Engli&s;h na|tion. The principality of Wales was united to the crown. Scotland, thrice &s;ubdued, was upon the point of being conquered for a fourth time, the Engli&s;h forces having already advanced to the borders. The &s;pirit of faction and di&s;cord was entirely extingui&s;hed in the kingdom. A good under&s;tanding was e&s;tabli&s;hed between the Sovereign and the people. And all the&s;e circum&s;tances &s;eemed to make ample amends for the lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained by the crown in foreign parts, during the reign of John and Henry III. not &s;o much through the weakne&s;s of the Engli&s;h, as the pu&s;illanimity and mi&s;conduct of the&s;e two Princes.</P>
<P>In the year A. D. 1312, was held the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of the council of Vienne, where Philip the Fair appeared in per&s;on, with three of his &s;ons, and his brother Charles de Valois. Pope Clement gave the a&s;&s;embly to under&s;tand, that he had convened them to con&s;ult about the recovery of the holy-land, and the fate of the Templars, who had been &s;eized and impri&s;oned all over Europe, in con&s;equence of being charged with crimes of the mo&s;t atrocious nature. In all probability, their great power and immen&s;e wealth excited the jea|lou&s;y and envy of the European Princes; for by this time they enjoyed &s;ixteen thou&s;and lord&s;hips in Chri&s;ten|dom. Such a &s;ociety, independent of all govern|ments, though their influence extended through every kingdom of Europe, could not but alarm every Prince of &s;ound policy, e&s;pecially as the order gained ground every day, and they increa&s;ed their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions either by purcha&s;e or benefaction. Philip the Fair, dreading the progre&s;s of their power, and allured by the hope of &s;haring their acqui&s;itions, &s;ound means to trump up an accu&s;ation again&s;t the whole order, containing &s;uch
<PB N="76" REF="83">articles as intailed upon them the dete&s;tation and ab|horrence of mankind.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the King began to act upon the public &s;tage of government, he di&s;covered an unrea&s;onable &s;ondne&s;s for peculiar favourites, particularly Piers Ga|ve&s;ton, a native of Guienne, which incurred the cen&s;ure of his friends, and the re&s;entment of his enemies.</P>
<P>At the parliament, which met on the 28th day of April, the Barons appeared in arms, and in&s;i&s;ted on the bani&s;hment of Gave&s;ton. Some per&s;ons, apprehen|&s;ive of the fatal con&s;equences that might en&s;ue from &s;uch a mi&s;under&s;tanding between the King and the no|bility, interpo&s;ed their good offices, and endeavoured to effect an accommodation: but the Barons would li&s;ten to no terms; they &s;till demanded that Gave&s;ton &s;hould abjure the realm before Mid&s;ummer, though they con&s;ented to his enjoying his whole e&s;tate; and the Bi&s;hops i&s;&s;ued a provincial &s;entence of excommuni|cation again&s;t him, &s;hould he remain any longer in the i&s;land.</P>
<P>The general voice of the people obliged him to di&s;|mi&s;s his favourite; but it was with &s;uch marks of e&s;teem, titles of honour, and grants of certain lands, as plainly intimated, that he &s;lighted the affection and regard of his &s;ubjects, and preferred his own plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>In the month of January 1314, a parliament was a&s;&s;embled, in order to examine the ordinances; but the King's council declaimed again&s;t them with &s;o much warmth and vehemence, as articles injurious to the crown, and &s;ubver&s;ive of the con&s;titution, that they were rejected by a majority: and for this rea&s;on the Earl of Lanca&s;ter, and the other a&s;&s;ociated Barons, refu&s;ed to &s;erve in the Scotti&s;h expedition.</P>
<P>The &s;e&s;&s;ion was &s;carce fini&s;hed, when Edward re|ceived advice that the Scots had invaded England, where they committed great depredations. In con&s;e|quence of this information, he &s;ent orders to the
<PB N="77" REF="84">Cinque-ports, and other maritime towns, to fit out a fleet, and be at Berwick by the day of rendezvous. Mean while he detached the Earl of Pembroke, whom he appointed guardian of Scotland, to oppo&s;e the pro|gre&s;s of the enemy in the north. He wrote to the Earl of Ul&s;ter, and to all the Iri&s;h chieftains, to a&s;&s;em|b$$ their followers, and come to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He or$$$$d new levies to be made in York&s;hire, and other pa$$$ $word$ the realm, and collected a more numerous an$ $word$ $$able army, than that with which the late K$$$ $ad accompli&s;hed the conque&s;t of Scotland.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed the Ea&s;ter holidays at Ely, he repair|ed to York, from whence he proceeded to Berwick, where he arrived in the beginning of June. As the time for the &s;urrender of Stirling was now approaching, he re&s;olved to advance to the relief of that place; and accordingly began his march, at the head of one hun|dred thou&s;and men, attended by a prodigious number of waggons and other carriages, loaded with baggage and provi&s;ions. The Engli&s;h tru&s;ting to the &s;uperio|rity of their numbers, proceeded with the mo&s;t care|le&s;s &s;ecurity, as if they had been going not to fight but to triumph.</P>
<P>They were permitted to advance without interrup|tion from Bruce, who was determined to venture a battle, and with that view had encamped in the neigh|bourhood of Stirling, where he waited the approach of the Engli&s;h. His army amounted to about 30,000 men, brave, hardy, and experienced, and firmly re&s;olved to die or conquer, in maintaining the liberty and inde|pendance of their country; both armies were warmly engaged, and they had many de&s;perate rencounters, but it terminated without any deci&s;ive victory.</P>
<P>Edward's finances being almo&s;t exhau&s;ted, he con|voked another parliament at We&s;tmin&s;ter, on the twentieth day of January, in order to obtain a &s;ub&s;idy, and deliberate about the &s;tate of the realm, which was now in a wretched condition. The country was not
<PB N="78" REF="85">only wa&s;ted by the enemy, but oppre&s;&s;ed by famine and the parliament per&s;uaded the King to i&s;&s;ue and edict again&s;t the monopolizers of provi&s;ions. This ordinance was accordingly publi&s;hed, but was repealed in the following year, becau&s;e it was found, that in&s;tead of an&s;wering the intended purpo&s;e, it only increa&s;ed the &s;carcity, and heightened the price of victuals.</P>
<P>To render the Barons the more complai&s;ant, the King confirmed the two charters, and even the late ordinances; and appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to fini&s;h the perambulation of the fore&s;ts. This expedient had the de&s;ired effect. The parliament, plea&s;ed with the&s;e con|ce&s;&s;ions, voted a twentieth of moveables; but as thi$ aid was not &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the King's nece&s;&s;ities he required a loan from all the religious &s;ocieties in th$ kingdom, and i&s;&s;ued writs, a&s;certaining the &s;um which each e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;hould pay, according to their abi|lities.</P>
<P>In order to prevent commotions for the future, Ed+ward endeavoured to conciliate the affection of the Welch, by granting them &s;ome new privileges and im+munities. The fines commonly paid by the tenants to their Lords for the marriage of their daughters were moderated: freeholders were allowed to put their &s;ons if they had more than one, into holy orders, withou$ the King's licence; and alienate their lands, for thre$ years, to any of their own countrymen, except monk$ and other religious hou&s;es; and orders were given fo$ ob&s;erving the ordinances of Hennington all over th$ principality.</P>
<P>Nor was Edward le&s;s careful in providing for the &s;e+curity of Ireland. He &s;ent a commi&s;&s;ion to John d$ Hotham, empowering him to rai&s;e money by the &s;a$$ of ward&s;hips, marriages, and other duties belonging $word$ the crown in that country, in order to enable him $word$ levy an army again&s;t the Scotti&s;h invaders. He pro+mi&s;ed rewards and encouragement to all tho&s;e wh$ &s;hould maintain their allegiance to the Engli&s;h go+vernment
<PB N="79" REF="86">and give their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in oppo&s;ing the enemy; and commanded the ju&s;ticiary to remove all officers that &s;eemed unqualified for their re&s;pective po&s;ts.</P>
<P>In the month of September, Edward publi&s;hed a writ for expelling all the Flemings out of England; and directed letters to the magi&s;trates of his dominions, enjoining them to break off all corre&s;pondence with that people, becau&s;e they were con&s;idered as rebels to the King of France.</P>
<P>This was done in con&s;equence of an article in the treaty between Edward I. of England and Philip the Fair of France, who had died in the cour&s;e of the pre|ceding year, by which the two parties were bound to afford no &s;helter or protection to the enemies of each other.</P>
<P>A parliament being a&s;&s;embled at Lincoln on the twenty-&s;eventh day of January, the King declared that he had called them together, in order to concert the proper mea&s;ures for reducing the rebels of Scotland; but finding them unwilling to embark in &s;uch an ex|pedition, he i&s;&s;ued writs, enjoining the &s;trict ob&s;er|vance of all the ordinances and perambulations: and the Barons were &s;o well plea&s;ed with this conce&s;&s;ion, that they voted a very extraordinary &s;upply for the maintainance of the Scotti&s;h war.</P>
<P>Edward, con&s;idering that nothing could contribute more to the &s;ucce&s;s of the undertaking than a perfect harmony and agreement between him and his Barons, re&s;olved to compromi&s;e all differences with the Earl of Lanca&s;ter, whom he now de&s;ired to come and pre&s;ide in his councils. That nobleman accepted the invitation, and was declared general of the forces de&s;tined for the Scotti&s;h expedition: and writs were i&s;&s;ued, requiring all per&s;ons, who held a knight's fee, or fifty pounds a-year in land, to come and receive the honour of knight|hood before the Trinity Sunday following.</P>
<PB N="80" REF="87">
<P>The clergy, at this parliament, excu&s;ed them&s;elves from giving any aid, on account of the famine, which now raged with uncommon violence, and rendered the country one mournful &s;cene of horror, death, and de|&s;olation. The wealthie&s;t noblemen were obliged to lay a&s;ide their equipages, and di&s;mi&s;s their &s;ervants; the highways were filled with robbery and murder; the &s;treets were covered with &s;pectacles of mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s; crouds of wretched and forlorn creatures were &s;een to die for want of food; and the helple&s;s parents lay expiring in the mid&s;t of their tender offspring, who &s;oon &s;hared the &s;ame unhappy fate. The pri&s;ons were bur&s;t open, and the criminals devoured by the furious populace; the dead were con&s;umed by the living; the graves were dug up, and robbed of their inhabitants, to appea&s;e the rage of hunger; nay, to &s;uch a terrible degree did this calamity prevail, that even the mother was known to de&s;troy, and feed upon the fruit of her own womb.</P>
<P>Edward had taken the cro&s;s a little before the death of his father; and the Pope, who was bent upon a cru&s;ade for the recovery of Pale&s;tine, had granted a year's tenth of all the eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues in the kingdom, for defraying the expence of that expedition; but as the war with Scotland prevented him from per|forming his vow, Clement commanded both Princes to agree to a truce for two years, on pain of excom|munication; and &s;ent over two Cardinals to &s;ettle the terms of the treaty.</P>
<P>In a parliament which was a&s;&s;embled at York, about a month after Ea&s;ter, A. D. 1319, the Earls and Ba|rons gave an eighteenth of their rents; the cities and boroughs granted a twelfth of their effects; and the clergy agreed to a tenth of their revenues, having, by this time, obtained the Pope's permi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The troops were ordered to rendezvous at New|ca&s;tle, by the tenth day of June; and all the military tenants of the crown were &s;ummoned to repair thither,
<PB N="81" REF="88">with hor&s;e and arms: the Earls of Lanca&s;ter, War|renne, Pembroke, Arundel, and Hereford, with the coheirs of the late Earl of Glouce&s;ter, and a great num|ber of Barons, attended with their followers; and as the King had promi&s;ed to every &s;oldier all the booty he &s;hould take, to the amount of one hundred pounds, an incredible number of infantry convened at the time and place appointed.</P>
<P>The common people had formed unlawful confede|racies and a&s;&s;ociations, overawing juries, extorting verdicts, ob&s;tructing the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, rob|bing parks, burning hou&s;es, and murdering individuals, with equal wantonne&s;s and impunity; and a law was now made, for inflicting condign puni&s;hment upon all who committed or encouraged the&s;e enormities.</P>
<P>There was another re&s;olution taken in this parliament, which is no le&s;s worthy of commendation. The Flem|ings had hitherto &s;upplied the Scots with arms and pro|vi&s;ions, notwith&s;tanding their being in alliance with the Engli&s;h nation, and in contempt of the repeated remon&s;tances again&s;t that unfair practice. They had even attacked and plundered &s;ome Engli&s;h &s;hips; and the &s;teps taken to procure redre&s;s of the&s;e grievances had hitherto proved abortive.</P>
<P>This affair being brought before the parliament, it was unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved, that the King of England was Lord of the Briti&s;h &s;eas; that all goods and mer|chandize taken from the Engli&s;h within the&s;e &s;eas, ought to be con&s;idered as taken within the realm, and the captors tried by the King's ju&s;tices: that &s;uits about the&s;e depredations &s;hould be determined accord|ing to law and rea&s;on; and that all per&s;ons concerned in &s;uch depredations, and knowingly receiving the prize-goods, either in whole or in part, &s;hould be charged and puni&s;hed accordingly.</P>
<P>The Scots had writ a &s;en&s;ible and pathetic letter to the Pope, explaining the nature of the quarrel between them and the Engli&s;h, and be&s;eeching him not only to
<PB N="82" REF="89">remove the cen&s;ure denounced again&s;t them, but al&s;o to u&s;e his influence with Edward, in putting an end to that bloody and de&s;tructive war, which had raged &s;o long to the ruin of both nations.</P>
<P>Though the Pope did not think proper to grant the former part of their petition, he &s;ent a bull to the King of England, advi&s;ing him to re&s;tore peace to the i&s;land. In compliance with this advice, Edward appointed the Archbi&s;hop of York, the Bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le, Robert Baldock, archdeacon of Middle&s;ex, and Geoffrey Scroop, as his commi&s;&s;ioners, to treat with the Scotti&s;h depu|ties about an accommodation. The King of France demanded, that his amba&s;&s;adors might be pre&s;ent at the conferences; but Edward, who &s;u&s;pected Philip to be a &s;ecret friend of Robert de Bruce, refu&s;ed to comply with his reque&s;t, and the negotiation proved abortive.</P>
<P>In a council held at Oxford, A. D. 1322, &s;everal u&s;eful con&s;titutions were enacted, touching the quali|fications of candidates for holy orders, the ordination of prie&s;ts, and the confirmation of children. Edward's oppo&s;ition to the Pope intailed upon him the re&s;ent|ment of the clergy, e&s;pecially the foreign eccle&s;ia&s;tics, who &s;ided with the Barons, and pretended that mira|cles were wrought at the tomb of the Earl of Lanca&s;ter, who &s;uffered for high trea&s;on. The&s;e &s;tories being in|du&s;triou&s;ly circulated by the monks of Pontefract, where that nobleman's body was interred, and coun|tenanced by the clergy of St. Paul's in London; the King ordered the church and priory of Pontefract to be &s;hut up, and &s;everely reprimanded the eccle&s;ia&s;tics of St. Paul's cathedral. Towards the end of his reign, he &s;olicited the Pope's con&s;ent to the di&s;&s;olution of &s;ome &s;mall &s;ees in Ireland, that they might be annexed to tho&s;e that were of more con&s;equence, to be filled with Engli&s;h prelates, as the mo&s;t natural expedient to keep the natives in order. He likewi&s;e de&s;ired his Holine&s;s would confirm the bull of Pope Honorius IV. &s;ubject|ing
<PB N="83" REF="90">the conventical church at We&s;tmin&s;ter to the im|mediate juri&s;diction of the Roman &s;ee, independent of any Engli&s;h metropolitan.</P>
<P>Edward endowed the Dominican convent at Langley in Hereford&s;hire with five hundred marks a year, to pray for the &s;oul of Piers Gave&s;ton; and he founded Oriel college, and St. Mary's hall, in Oxford.</P>
<P>But his conduct in civil affairs was &s;uch, as expo&s;ed him to the cen&s;ure of his &s;ubjects, and even incurred the re&s;entment of his Barons; and, in A. D. 1327, the hou&s;e were violent again&s;t the King and his adhe|rents; and the Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter drew up &s;ix arti|cles of impeachment again&s;t the King, importing, that he wanted capacity to govern the realm, ina&s;much as he had been, during the whole cour&s;e of his reign, mi&s;led by evil coun&s;ellors, to his own di&s;honour, and to the prejudice of the church and people, without giving ear to the advice of the greate&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t men of the kingdom: that he employed his time in pur&s;uits un|worthy of his character, and neglected the affairs of the admini&s;tration: that by his mi&s;conduct he lo&s;t the kingdom of Scotland, together with lands and terri|tories in Ga&s;cony and Ireland: that he di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the holy church, by pro&s;ecuting and impri&s;oning church|men; and that he cau&s;ed many noblemen of the land to be impri&s;oned, bani&s;hed, di&s;inherited, and put to ignominious deaths: that, in&s;tigated by evil coun&s;el, and his own avarice, he had broke his coronation-oath: that he abandoned his people, and did as much as in him lay to ruin the kingdom: and that the&s;e truths being notorious, he was altogether incorrigible, and ought therefore to be depo&s;ed. The&s;e articles being read in pre&s;ence of the Prince &s;eated on the throne, it was re&s;olved that young Edward &s;hould a&s;&s;ume the regal power; and that the old King &s;hould be no longer &s;tiled King of England, but called Edward of Caernarvon, the King's father.</P>
<PB N="84" REF="91">
<P>In this unhappy &s;ituation, de&s;erted by his Queen, and &s;on advanced to the regal dignity or power, he had little favour to expect from tho&s;e few friends, who had it in their power or inclination to &s;erve him, and an impending trial to expect, in which his conduct would be &s;crutinized, and he would feel the dreadful effects of a public tribunal. He therefore fled from his country, retired to Wales, and from thence to Ireland, where he endeavoured in vain to &s;ecrete him|&s;elf; for through bribery and treachery he was be|trayed, and murdered by a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, A. D 1327.</P>
<P>Thus peri&s;hed Edward II. after having atoned by his &s;ufferings for all the errors of his conduct. He is &s;aid to have re&s;embled his father in the accompli&s;h|ments of his per&s;on, as well as in his countenance: but in other re&s;pects he &s;eems to have inherited only the defects of his character; for he was cruel and illiberal, without his valour or capacity. He had levity, indo|lence, and irre&s;olution, in common with other weak Princes; but the di&s;tingui&s;hing foible of his character, was that unaccountable pa&s;&s;ion for the reigning favou|rite, to which he &s;acrificed every other con&s;ideration of policy and convenience, and at la&s;t fell a mi&s;erable victim. Yet his bittere&s;t enemy never alledged that any thing unnatural entered into the compo&s;ition of that &s;ingular attachment which he expre&s;&s;ed for Ga|ve&s;ton and the younger D'E&s;pen&s;er.</P>

<HEAD>EDWARD III. <HI>&s;urnamed of</HI> Wind&s;or, A. D. 1327.</HEAD>
<P>The parliament, by which young Edward had been rai&s;ed to the throne during the life of his father, ap|pointed twelve per&s;ons as his privy council, to direct the affairs of the realm; and Henry Earl of Lanca&s;ter, being re&s;tored to the dignity of High Steward of England, was intru&s;ted with the guardian&s;hip of the young Prince. Edward, even at this early age, di&s;co|vered that martial di&s;po&s;ition for which he was after|wards
<PB N="85" REF="92">&s;o renowned, particularly in his engagements with the French and Scotch.</P>
<P>Edward King of England had &s;ummoned a parlia|ment at London, to deliberate on the &s;ubject of an expedition he propo&s;ed to undertake for the relief of the Holy Land, in conjunction with other European Princes; but, when he heard of the turn of affairs in Scotland, that de&s;ign was po&s;tponed; their delibera|tions adopted a more intere&s;ting object. They im|mediately granted extraordinary &s;ub&s;idies for the reduc|tion of the in&s;urgents of Scotland; the King forth|with &s;ummoned the military tenants, and re&s;olved to pa&s;s the winter in the North, that he might be at hand in the &s;pring to invade that country with a powerful army: mean while he &s;ent a body of forces to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Edward Baliol, who, thus reinforced, ove$$$ran all the we&s;tern parts of Scotland, and had well nigh taken Robert, the &s;teward of that kingdom, a youth about fifteen years of age, the nephew and heir of David de Bruce, whom he &s;ucceeded on the Scotti&s;h throne. He was Lord of Bute and Arran, two i&s;lands which Baliol reduced; but young Robert e&s;ca|ped his &s;earch, and took refuge in the ca&s;tle of Dun|britton. During the&s;e tran&s;actions in the We&s;t, King Edward entered into Scotland, by Berwick, marched into the heart of the kingdom without &s;eeing the face of an enemy; and in his return received a letter from Patrick Dunbar, Earl of March, containing a formal renunciation of his homage. In all probability the &s;iege of his ca&s;tle would have been the immediate con&s;equence of this defection, had not the operations of war been &s;u&s;pended by the arrival of amba&s;&s;adors from France, &s;ent to mediate an accommodation be|tween the Scots and the King of England. A treaty was immediately begun at Gedeling, near Nottingham, whither the Scotti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners repaired, under the &s;ecurity of a &s;afe-conduct; and in the mean time both
<PB N="86" REF="93">parties agreed to a ce&s;&s;ation of arms, to continue to the following Mid&s;ummer.</P>
<P>The plan of pacification drawn up by the French amba&s;&s;adors, who were in the intere&s;t of the Scots, was utterly rejected by Edward, who re&s;olved to treat with them in another manner. All the Bi&s;hops, Ba|rons, and freeholders in Ireland, were ordered to con|tribute a certain proportion of men and money for the reduction of Scotland; the Earls of Namure, Juliers and Montbeliard, were engaged in the &s;ervice of Eng|land, and directions given for equipping large fleets in Ga&s;cony and England. The Lord Ju&s;tice d'Arcy brought a body of forces from Ireland, in &s;ix and fifty ve&s;&s;els, with which he ravaged the i&s;les of Bute and Arran; though he did not &s;ucceed in his attempts.</P>
<P>In a parliament which met in the beginning of February, A. D. 1338, Edward repre&s;ented the ex|traordinary occa&s;ions he had for large &s;ums of money, to pay the &s;ub&s;idies which he had granted to his fo|reign allies; and the prelates, nobility, and freeholders, indulged him with a moiety of their wool, which &s;old for four hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, be|&s;ides a duty of two &s;hillings a ton upon wine, added to the u&s;ual cu&s;tom paid by all foreign merchants. Over and above this enormous impo&s;ition, the inferior clergy, a&s;&s;embled in convocation at St. Bride's in Lon|don, granted a tenth of their revenues, exclu&s;ive of a tax of a triennial tenth, to which they had before con|&s;ented. This was the heavie&s;t burden that ever had been laid upon the nation; to which it was &s;o grievous, that the King de&s;ired the two Archbi&s;hops, and their &s;uf|fragans, to repre&s;ent his nece&s;&s;ities to the people, in &s;uch a manner that they &s;hould bear the load with pa|tience. Va&s;t as all the &s;ub&s;idy may &s;eem to have been, con&s;idering the value of money in tho&s;e days, it was unequal to the expence of his armament, and treaties of alliance; for the German Princes were ever as in|&s;atiable
<PB N="87" REF="94">in their demands, as dilatory in the performance of their contracts. Though he embarked in various wars, he was at length de&s;erted by the Germans, and gained by his conduct more applau&s;e than advantage.</P>
<P>A. D. 1349.] The plague, which at the latter end of the &s;ummer broke out in the We&s;t of England, had by this time reached London; and therefore the parliament, which had been &s;ummoned to meet in January, was prorogued until that calamity &s;hould abate, though it raged two years, during which no &s;e&s;&s;ion was held, nor any court of ju&s;tice kept open. In the fir&s;t &s;ix months of this year, &s;even and fifty thou&s;and per&s;ons are &s;aid to have died of the plague, in Norwich and London; and the church-yards being found too &s;mall for the burial of the dead, Sir Walter de Mar&s;ny purcha&s;ed a piece of ground, belonging to St. Bartholomew's ho&s;pital in Smithfield, to &s;erve for the interment of tho&s;e who were carried off by the pe&s;tilence, which no &s;ooner cea&s;ed, than he founded on the &s;pot a convent of Carthu&s;ians. This dreadful vi|&s;itation &s;pread into Wales and Ireland, and raged chiefly among the common people, and of the&s;e, the old men, women and children; none of the better &s;ort died of the infection, except three or f$ur of the nobility, and Jane the King's &s;econd daughter, who was infected at Bourdeaux in her way to Ca&s;tile, where &s;he was to have been married to the Infant Don Pe|dro, &s;on of Alphon&s;o XI. &s;overeign of that kingdom, When the contagion among the human &s;pecies abated, the &s;heep and cattle peri&s;hed in va&s;t numbers; and no bird or bea&s;t of prey would touch their carca&s;&s;es, which lay putrifying upon the &s;urface of the ground. The harve&s;t was lo&s;t for want of hands to gather it, and hence followed a dreadful dearth of labour and provi&s;ion. The Scots, tempted by the hope of an ea&s;y prey, in &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on of calamity and de&s;olation, invaded the northern counties, and, together with a
<PB N="88" REF="95">large booty, carried back the contagion to their own country, where it made terrible havock<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. III. pag. 429.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A. D. 1351.] The plague being by this time quite extingui&s;hed, the King, by the advice of his council, publi&s;hed &s;ome ordinances to prevent the exorbitant demand of &s;ervants and labourers; and at the &s;ame time increa&s;ed the &s;alaries of judges, that they might not be &s;ubject to temptation in the exerci&s;e of their func|tions. The Lord Chief Ju&s;tice Thorn being accu&s;ed of corruption, threw him&s;elf upon the King's mercy, and &s;entence of death was pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t him accord|ing to law; but his life was &s;pared, and he afterwards obtained a full pardon. A parliament being a&s;&s;embled, confirmed the King's ordinances, by erecting them into &s;tatutes; and enacting other laws, touching per|&s;ons born beyond &s;ea, be&s;ides the &s;tatutes of cloths and of provi&s;ors of benefices; but that of purveyors did not pa&s;s till next parliament.</P>
<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, the King convoked a parliament at We&s;tmin&s;ter, which granted a &s;ub&s;idy for three years on wool and leather, and enacted a &s;tatute again&s;t provi&s;ors, re&s;ervations, citations to Rome, and other papal u&s;urpations. Urban V. re|&s;enting this law, demanded the arrears of the tribute granted by King John to the church of Rome; and threatened to pro&s;ecute the King and kingdom, &s;hould they refu&s;e to comply with his demand. This affair being con&s;idered in the &s;ub&s;equent &s;e&s;&s;ion, which met in May, the parliament re&s;olved that King John could not &s;ubject him&s;elf or his kingdom in &s;uch a manner, without the concurrence and con&s;ent of his people; and that if the Pope &s;hould proceed to violent mea|&s;ures, they would oppo&s;e him to the utmo&s;t of their power *.</P>

They deliberated upon this &s;ubject, and an&s;wered in the affirmative; and the Lords and Commons adopting the &s;ame opinion, he re&s;umed them accordingly, and ordered his great &s;eal to be altered. An extraordinary &s;ub&s;idy was granted upon &s;kins and wool, and every thing prepared for the war, which France had &s;o un|ju&s;tly kindled. The Prince now enters upon &s;everal engagements with the troops of Charles of France, in which &s;ome of his generals rather betrayed their ho|nour and tru&s;t, than vindicated the authority of his crown, in&s;omuch there was no &s;ucce&s;s attended their engagements, and there was &s;oon after a truce between France and England.</P>
<P>A. D. 1376.] There was a new parliament called, who granted a con&s;iderable &s;ub&s;idy by way of poll-tax, which was even extended to all the clergy, except the Mendicant friers; but, as the nece&s;&s;ities of the court would not admit of a delay, until this aid could be collected, the mini&s;ters demanded a loan of 4000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> from the city of London, which refu&s;ed to advance the money. This refu&s;al was re&s;ented in &s;uch a manner by the court, that Adam Staple was removed from the mayoralty by a &s;pecial mandamus, and Sir Richard Whittington appointed as his &s;ucce&s;&s;or in that office. The Commons manife&s;ted their complai&s;ance to the mini&s;try, not only in the &s;upplies which they readily granted, but al&s;o in re&s;erving a great many uncourtly re&s;olutions, which had been taken in the preceedng parliament. This may &s;uffice for the civil hi&s;tory of this reign.</P>

<P>A.

<P>And in a &s;ub&s;equent provincial &s;ynod, held by the &s;ame Archbi&s;hop, other canons were e&s;tabli&s;hed; the fir&s;t of which, enacted at the King's reque&s;t, pronoun|ces the &s;entence of the greater excommunication again&s;t all rebels and di&s;turbers of the King's peace; the &s;econd, was levelled again&s;t the extravagance of churchmen; the third, prohibits the practice of farming church-livings to lay-men and women; the fourth, denounced cen&s;ures upon tho&s;e who defrauded or interrupted prie&s;ts in the collection of tithes; the fifth, exacted tithes of the lopping of trees; the &s;ixth, prohibited laymen from touching the offerings made in churches; the &s;eventh, regulated the admini&s;tration of wills and inventories; the eighth, inhibited the Bi&s;hops and their officers, within the province of Canterbury, from intermeddling with the goods of beneficed clergymen, decea&s;ed, who&s;e e&s;tates ought to be at the di&s;po&s;al of their executors; the ninth, provided again&s;t all fraudulent conveyances during a per&s;on's life, by which the King may be de|prived of his dues, and the wives and their children of their portions; the tenth, forbad all buffoonery, re|velling and riots, at the night-watches in behalf of the dead, which ought to be &s;pent in p&s;alms and prayers for the &s;oul of the decea&s;ed: the re&s;t were cal|culated for clande&s;tine marriages, as well as the en|croachment of lay-noblemen, who frequently interfered with the eccle&s;ia&s;tical officer, in the article of te&s;taments made by villains, whom the lord of the manor wanted to exclude from that privilege; for providing again&s;t the contempt of church-cen&s;ures; the practice of cut|ting

<P>Edward III.<NOTE PLACE="inter">His cha|racter.</NOTE> was undoubtedly one of the greate&s;t Princes that ever &s;wayed the &s;cepter of England, whether we re&s;pect him as a warrior or lawgiver, a Monarch or a man. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the courage and ro|mantic &s;pirit of Alexander; the penetration, the for|tude, the poli&s;hed manners of Julius; the munificence, the liberality, and the wi&s;dom of Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar. He was tall, maje&s;tic, finely &s;haped, with a piercing eye, and aquiline vi&s;age. He excelled all his cotem|poraries in feats of arms and per&s;onal addre&s;s. He was courteous, affable and eloquent; of a free deport|ment, and agreeable conver&s;ation; and had the art of commanding the affection of his &s;ubjects, without &s;eeming to &s;olicit popularity. He was a con&s;titutional knight-errant; and his example diffu&s;ed the &s;pirit of chivalry through the whole nation. In imitation of the youthful Monarch, who delighted in tilts and tournaments, every individual betook him&s;elf to the exerci&s;e of arms, every brea&s;t glowed with emulation, every heart panted with the thir&s;t of glory; and when he took the field, there was not a &s;oldier in his army, who did not &s;erve from &s;entiment, and fight for repu|tion. The love of glory was certainly the predo|minant pa&s;&s;ion of Edward, to the gratification of which he did not &s;cruple to &s;acrifice the feelings of humanity, the lives of his &s;ubjects, and the intere&s;t of his country; and nothing could have induced or enabled his people to bear the load of taxes, with which they were incum|bered in this reign, but the love and admiration of his per&s;on, the fame of his victories, and the excellent laws and regulations which the parliament enacted with his advice and concurrence.</P>

He maintained that the bread and wine, in the Euchari&s;t, was not the real &s;ub&s;tance, but only a type of Chri&s;t's body; that the church of Rome is not the &s;upreme over all other churches; and that Chri&s;t did not give greater power to Peter, than to the re&s;t of his Apo&s;tles; that a lay-patron may lawfully and me|ritoriou&s;ly dive&s;t a degenerate church of her tempo|ralities; that the go&s;pel is &s;ufficient for regulating the life and morals of every Chri&s;tian; and that all other rules of &s;anctity, add no more perfection to the go&s;pel, than whitene&s;s adds to a wall; that neither the Pope, nor any Chri&s;tian prelate, ought to puni&s;h or confine delinquents, but that every individual &s;hould do what &s;eemeth good in his own eyes, until he is apprehended by the civil magi&s;trate. Wickliffe, and his followers, affected a remarkable au&s;terity in their way of living, which impre&s;&s;ed the vulgar with a high opinion of their &s;anctity; and the doctrine in favour of lay-patrons was &s;o agreeable to the nobility in general, who wanted to humble the clergy, that he &s;oon numbered a va&s;t multitude of common people, and &s;ome of the mo&s;t powerful Lords of the kingdom, among his converts. The Pope being informed of his &s;ucce&s;s, &s;ent a bull directed to the metropolitan of Canterbury and the Bi&s;hop of London, requiring them to &s;eize and &s;ecure the per&s;on of this arch-heretic; and they unwilling to proceed at once to extremities, contented them&s;elves with &s;ummoning him to a &s;ynod convened at St. Paul's in London.

<P>WHEN gro&s;s error and &s;uper&s;tition had in a great mea&s;ure corrupted the whole Chri&s;tian church, when even idolatry, cruelty, and many other enormities, had &s;o generally prevailed, a reformation in the very nature of things became highly nece&s;&s;ary; and the hi&s;tories of the Romi&s;h church not only furni&s;h us with a variety of in&s;tances in confirmation of this truth, but we find many of the Popes them&s;elves com|plained of the great abu&s;es of many of their &s;acred rites, and general corruption of manners, and profe&s;&s;ed to make it their principal care to produce a reformation. Thus Paul III. appointed a &s;elect council of prelates, to collect tho&s;e abu&s;es, which were mo&s;t notorious and pernicious, and pre&s;ent them to him, that he might correct them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Richer's Hi&s;t. of the Council General, lib. iv. part ii. p. 136.</NOTE>. Pope Marcellus II. &s;aid, that he re|&s;olved to make a &s;evere and entire reformation, but died before he could give proof of it<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of the Council of Trent, lib. v.</NOTE>. Pope Paul IV. who &s;ucceeded him, promi&s;ed to reform, not verbally, but really the head, members, clergy, laity, princes, and people<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Allen V. as &s;oon as he was cho&s;en by the Pi&s;an council, promi&s;ed to &s;et him&s;elf to the work, and to chu&s;e good and learned men out of every nation, to con&s;ult with the Cardinals about it<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Council of Pi&s;an, Se&s;&s;. 21.

<PB N="94" REF="101">the abominable corruptions of the church, and e&s;peci|ally of the court of Rome; and profe&s;&s;ed that he took the papacy upon him, to the end he might reform the univer&s;al church<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sleidan's Comment, lib. iv.</NOTE>. To this we may add, the con|current voice of the church's repre&s;entatives in a gene|ral council. The fir&s;t Pi&s;an council (as it is common|ly reckoned, tho' it was indeed the &s;econd) were re|&s;olved to reform the church<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Council of Pi&s;an, Se&s;&s;. 17.</NOTE>. The council of Con|&s;tance, which followed five years after, decreed, that the Pope, which was then to be cho&s;en, &s;hould, to|gether with the council, or tho&s;e deputed by the &s;e|veral nations for that purpo&s;e, reform the church be|fore that be di&s;&s;olved; and the matters, about which the reformation was to be made, were reduced to eighteen heads<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Council of Con&s;tant. Se&s;&s;. 40.</NOTE>. In the council of Ba&s;il, the Pope gave his Legate full power of concluding all &s;uch things as tended to the reformation of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate: that the church &s;hould be reformed in the head and in the members, and that the ancient di&s;cipline &s;hould be again re&s;tored<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Council of Ba&s;il, Se&s;&s;. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To add one in&s;tance more, the &s;econd council of Pi&s;a decreed, that the reformation of the church was mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, and pa&s;&s;ed this decree upon it, that the holy &s;ynod would not, nor could di&s;&s;olve it&s;elf, till the univer&s;al church &s;hould be reformed, both in faith and manners, as well in the head as the members. Where it is ob&s;ervable, that the reformation decreed in this council, as &s;o highly nece&s;&s;ary, did extend to faith as well as manners; and &s;o did that of many others, as might be &s;hewn if nece&s;&s;ary<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Richer's Hi&s;tory of Councils Gen. lib. iii.

And the zeal of Sigi&s;mund the Emperor was abun|dantly manife&s;t for a reformation, who u&s;ed indefati|gable pains in a&s;&s;i&s;ting at a council at Con&s;tance for that purpo&s;e<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of the Council of Trent. lib. vii. p. 682.</NOTE>. Nor were the Princes of Germany le&s;s zealous for a reformation, as appears by their an&s;wer $word$ Cheregat, the Pope's Nuncio, at the diet of Nu|$e$$berg, in 1523, in&s;i&s;ting upon the reforming of abu&s;es, and correcting of many errors and vices, which by long tract of time had taken deep root, and for the affecting of which they demanded a free council; and the&s;e they enumerated in an hundred particulars, and pre&s;enting them to the Pope, declared they neither would nor could endure them any longer<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Sleidan's Comment. lib. iv.</NOTE>. We might here with great propriety mention what great complaints were made by the Kings of England again&s;t the encroachments of Rome. How often did they pe|tition for redre&s;s, and to how little purpo&s;e, hi&s;tory &s;ufficiently &s;hew us, in&s;omuch that Edward III. and Richard II. did in part right them&s;elves, and their &s;ubjects, by the Statutes of <HI>Provi&s;ors</HI> and <HI>Praemunire.</HI> But of the efforts made by the Engli&s;h to &s;o important a de&s;ign, and the &s;ucce&s;s attending and con&s;equent to them, we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak more particular|ly<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Richer, lib. iv. par. ii. p. 130.</NOTE>. To conclude this head, to &s;o mon&s;trous a de|formed &s;tate was the we&s;tern churches degenerated, that the prince, the prie&s;t, the clergy, the laity, men of all conditions, and of all nations, yea, (if the infalli|ble oracle, Pope Adrian VI. &s;poke truth) the whole world, groaned after a reformation<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">27 Edward III. lib. i.</NOTE>.

<P>The gro&s;s corruptions in doctrine may be reckoned &s;ome of the following, viz.

<P>In Wor&s;hip. Fir&s;t, in having their public wor&s;hip in an unknown tongue&mdash;the propitiatory &s;acrifice of the ma&s;s&mdash;the &s;olitary ma&s;s, in which the prie&s;t alone who con&s;ecrates, communicates&mdash;the half commu|nion, the lay-people receiving only in one kind, viz. bread&mdash;giving divine wor&s;hip to the con&s;ecrated bread &mdash;wor&s;hipping of images&mdash;repre&s;enting God by a picture, and wor&s;hipping him under that repre&s;entation &mdash;their &s;olemn prayers to &s;aints departed&mdash;pre&s;er|ving reliques of &s;aints, and wor&s;hipping them.</P>
<P>The corruption of manners which was &s;o prevalent in the church of Rome, and cried aloud for reforma|tion&mdash;this was univer&s;al in all &s;tates and degrees of men &mdash;more e&s;pecially in the clergy&mdash;and mo&s;t e&s;pecially in the Pope and Cardinals.</P>
<P>And with re&s;pect to di&s;cipline. Their &s;elling par|dons and indulgences for &s;ins is a palpable method of
<PB N="97" REF="104">evading it&mdash;the doctrine of probability and good in|tention, by which a per&s;on may act any &s;in, if he can pretend &s;ome good de&s;ign or motive&mdash;the doctrine of venial and mortal &s;ins, and thereby paving a way for commuting for the commi&s;&s;ion of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ini|quities.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved by Hege&s;ippus, that the church re|mained a cha&s;te virgin, and the &s;pou&s;e of Chri&s;t, till the &s;acred quire of the apo&s;tles, and their immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, who had the honour to be their auditors, were extinct, and then there began a plain con&s;piracy of impious, ab&s;urd errors, by the fraud of teachers, who taught other doctrines for the doctrines of Chri&s;t.</P>

In con&s;equence of this, in&s;tead of meekly in&s;tructing, and convincing tho&s;e who have erred from the truth, they impo&s;e certain fines and penalties, or denounce the mo&s;t &s;evere cur&s;es and anathemas again&s;t them; and in&s;tead of letting the tares and the wheat grow to|gether till the harve&s;t, they de&s;troy men's lives for no other crime than involuntary errors, and this, often|times, by methods of the mo&s;t inhuman cruelty.</P>
<P>From the&s;e premi&s;&s;es it appears, that the errors of that church were not &s;light, and in matters of &s;mall moment; but &s;o gro&s;s and erroneous, when the refor|mation was &s;et on foot, that there was a nece&s;&s;ity of reforming them; and that no hope was left that the church of Rome would reform the&s;e errors in her&s;elf,

<P>Indeed &s;ome attempts were made toward a refor|mation from the &s;ixth to the ninth century. The Greek or Ea&s;tern churches prote&s;ted again&s;t &s;ome of the errors, and corruptions, of the church of Rome, par|ticularly the wor&s;hipping of images&mdash;they objected to the doctrine of the Holy Gho&s;t proceeding from the Father and the Son, and not from the Father only&mdash; they cen&s;ured their fa&s;ting on Saturdays&mdash;found fault with the Latin prie&s;ts for &s;having their beards&mdash;with their being obliged to celibacy&mdash;with their forbidding to anoint the baptized with chri&s;m&mdash;with their making Bi&s;hops of Deacons without fir&s;t conferring the order of prie&s;thood&mdash;with their offering a lamb at Ea&s;ter, &amp;c.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dupin's Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory, vol. iii. c$nt. ix. p. 14.</NOTE></P>
<P>And on account of the&s;e, and &s;ome other peculiari|ties, about the clo&s;e of the ninth century, they began to &s;eparate from their communion.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the few points in which their di&s;&s;ention, and con&s;equent &s;eparation from the Romi&s;h church might be ju&s;tified, it appears they were but little behind them in &s;uper&s;titious rites and ceremonies, ari&s;ing from their gro&s;s ignorance, prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and prejudices, promoted by their de&s;igning, avaricious and bigotted prie&s;ts.</P>
<P>And, indeed, wherever the go&s;pel had &s;pread it&s;elf, its original &s;implicity was ob&s;cured by human inven|tions; its native beauty defaced by &s;uper&s;tition, and its genuine de&s;ign, and beneficent purpo&s;es, ob&s;tructed by tyranny and per&s;ecution: yet, as ab&s;urd as many of their inventions were, ridiculous as &s;ome of their ceremonies mu&s;t appear to rational unprejudiced minds, and their oppre&s;&s;ion and per&s;ecution contradictory to
<PB N="99" REF="108">the natural principles of humanity, and a truly Chri&s;tian &s;pirit: yet the&s;e, I &s;ay, with a variety of tricks, pretended miracles, &amp;c. were indu&s;triou&s;ly and &s;ucce&s;sfully maintained and promoted for near fif|teen centuries; and, what may &s;eem more &s;trange, the church gained the a&s;cendant of the &s;tate, and their ini|quities were e&s;tabli&s;hed by laws, the ob&s;ervance of which were inforced by the &s;evere&s;t penalties.</P>
<P>And tho', in proce&s;s of time, that undue u&s;urpation of power over the con&s;ciences and the rights of man|kind, which is the bane of religion, became the means, under divine providence, for introducing a reforma|tion from the gro&s;&s;er errors of papi&s;try, in &s;everal parts of the Chri&s;tian world; the attempts made by the Bi&s;hops, or Popes, and other dignified clergy, have been at be&s;t but partial, &s;uperficial, limited, and re|&s;trained, by peculiarly &s;trong attachments to party-intere&s;t and popular prejudices, or deterred by the dif|ficulty attending it; &s;o that, notwith&s;tanding the fulle&s;t conviction of the di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of the clergy, the errors and &s;uper&s;titious ceremonies that were continually creeping into the church, and notwith&s;tanding many profe&s;&s;ions made to reform the clergy, and to re&s;tore greater purity of di&s;cipline and wor&s;hip, nothing very con&s;iderable was effected, nor could rea&s;onably be ex|pected of this kind, from tho&s;e who &s;tood in the fir&s;t rank, with re&s;pect to power and dignity, in the church of Rome: and when this nece&s;&s;ary and important work was &s;carcely undertaken in earne&s;t, or promi&s;ing &s;uc|ce&s;s from that quarter, it became in an high degree nece&s;&s;ary for per&s;ons in a civil capacity, laymen as well as eccle&s;ia&s;tical per&s;ons, to engage therein, notwith|&s;tanding the ta&s;k was exceeding laborious, the attempt hazardous, and, as it proved, by a variety of efforts, too often ineffectual to encounter the oppo&s;ition it gene|rally met with.</P>
<P>The rea&s;ons for a reformation are variou&s;ly con&s;i|dered by different authors. Mr. Leave&s;ly reduces them
<PB N="100" REF="109">to the following: fir&s;t, That there are &s;ome things ab|horrent to nature; innocent and uncorrupted nature has &s;ome &s;trong antipathies, that ari&s;e to an indigna|tion, that cannot bear &s;ome objects, fal&s;hood and for|gery, tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion, inju&s;tice and cruelty, and hypocri&s;y in religion: the mind of man is &s;u&s;cep|tible of noble pa&s;&s;ions and affections, and there is a &s;ecret univer&s;al plea&s;ure where actions comport there|with. Secondly, The nece&s;&s;ity from intere&s;t, &s;elf-pre|&s;ervation, and defence of liberty, civil and religious, calls for, a reformation. Popery is calculated to de|prive us of our liberties, challenge our properties, lay us under terrible cen&s;ures, and by acts of excommu|nication, with all the appendages to it, deprive us of every thing that is dear and valuable. But, thirdly, The main &s;pring and force of this is con&s;cience, the &s;en&s;e of our duty to God. This appeared in all the &s;teps of the reformation; and nothing el&s;e could have engaged the reformers to di&s;turb the cour&s;e of error, and the reign of popery, at &s;o great a hazard, and with &s;o unequal forces: but the firm per&s;ua&s;ion of the mind, and the more powerful influence of con&s;cience, are incitements almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible; and this increa&s;es in proportion to the mi&s;chiefs and evil con&s;equences at|tending a &s;upine indifference; whatever peace and emo|lument we might have &s;ecured by &s;ilence and &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to long continued u&s;urpations, the call of God would have di&s;turbed our tranquillity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leave&s;ly's Sermon at Salter's Hall.</NOTE>. Notwith&s;tand|ing their boa&s;ted claim of being the only true catholic church, and lawful mini&s;try and pa&s;tors, we can &s;ee clearly their impo&s;tures and corruptions, their &s;uper|&s;tition and idolatry, their anti-chri&s;tian doctrines and oppo&s;ition to the truths of the go&s;pel. Many of their doctrines are fal&s;e and ab&s;urd, their wor&s;hip idolatrous. Papi&s;try recommends many impious and wicked practices; the &s;pirit of it is tyrannical, domineering, and cruel, and a gro&s;s corruption of the &s;implicity of the
<PB N="101" REF="110">go&s;pel, both in faith and practice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Barker.</NOTE>. And we are as ab&s;olutely &s;ure as the words of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles can make it, that we as Chri&s;tians are required to ad|here to the truth as it is in Je&s;us.</P>
<P>The mini&s;try they in&s;tituted we are bound to &s;et up; the a&s;&s;emblies of Chri&s;tians, which are founded on their authority, we are bound to frequent; the &s;acraments they in&s;tituted, we are bound to ob&s;erve; and &s;hould we neglect the call and authority of Chri&s;t, and cor|rupt his in&s;titution, we might ju&s;tly tremble at the anathema<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ab&s;tract from Leave&s;ly's Sermon at Salter's Hall, p. 36.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Fourthly, The dangerous delu&s;ions of a multitude of poor &s;ouls move our compa&s;&s;ion; and we cannot but think our &s;eparation from the Roman commu|nion nece&s;&s;ary, to hold out a light of warning and direction to them. 'Tis con&s;cience, therefore, of our duty to God and man, and that fidelity we owe to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, our only Lord and &s;upreme head of his church, that lays us under this obligation.</P>
<P>We don't erect a Prote&s;tant &s;upremacy and infalli|bility upon the ruins of the Papal, nor undertake to maintain all the doctrines of Luther and Zuinglius, or Calvin, or the churches of France, or England, or Scotland. This would be to build up again what we have de&s;troyed, and to ruin that liberty of examining and proving all things, that we may hold fa&s;t that which is good.</P>
<P>The word <HI>Reformation</HI> looks back to an original rectitude e&s;tabli&s;hed by God in the very nature of things, and declared and &s;ettled by the only &s;upreme authority of God him&s;elf, by tho&s;e whom we are &s;ure he em|powered and qualified; and where the&s;e are contradict|ed, we may reject all pretenders to a divine authority, <HI>to the law and to the te&s;timony.</HI></P>
<P>God has given man his under&s;tanding to this purpo&s;e, which has an original liberty and power to ob&s;erve
<PB N="102" REF="111">things, and enquire and judge with due care and circum|&s;pection, to di&s;cern between right and wrong, good and evil, that we might try things which differ, and <HI>approve things that are excellent.</HI> And whoever would engage our &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t do it by <HI>commending them&s;elves to our con|&s;cience in the &s;ight of God, by the manife&s;tation of the truth.</HI></P>
<P>We therefore rejoice in the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of the reformation in Germany, Switzerland, Geneva, France (as it once was, oh! that it were &s;uch now) and the churches of England and Scotland. But our reforma|tion mu&s;t be according to our light, and in proportion to our advantages. We mu&s;t &s;o wor&s;hip God as we think will be mo&s;t acceptable to him; unite with tho&s;e &s;ocieties wherein we can receive the greate&s;t edification and profit, and yet leave others without any uncha|ritable cen&s;ures, or &s;o much as wi&s;hing to deprive them of that liberty we claim, and with the utmo&s;t rea&s;on for our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Therefore let us continue Prote&s;tants indeed, and we &s;hall not in the end repent of any labour, hazards, or expences, that it may co&s;t us. Let us adhere to our Bible; let us be humble and cautious, look to God by daily fervent prayer, that he that has called us to go out of Babylon, would conduct us to the end.</P>
<P>Let us be humble and cautious, not too &s;evere upon imperfect, differing, or erring Prote&s;tants: let us keep our own con&s;cience void of offence, and leave others to their great Ma&s;ter. Let us not &s;eek the prai&s;e of men, or be di&s;couraged at their cen&s;ures. Judge nothing before its time, but wait for that time, when every one &s;hall receive their prai&s;e of God.</P>

<P>INtroductory to this part of the hi&s;tory, it is ob&s;erv|able the Chri&s;tian religion was in the fir&s;t ages ve|nerable for its &s;implicity; but &s;oon after, when the teachers of divers &s;orts of philo&s;ophy became Chri&s;|tians, they endeavoured to adorn it with the rules and doctrines of their &s;everal &s;ects; to which the Jews, Greeks and others, added the ceremonies of their re&s;pective countries, to the end that the outward &s;plen|dor of &s;uch in&s;titutions, which was found to have no ill effect, might be converted to a better u&s;e: but the&s;e things, which for a long time were left to every man's liberty, and were only received by the private approbation of &s;ome particular per&s;ons, or churches, prevailed gradually by practice, and at length by the per&s;ua&s;ion of their introducers and favourers, and the con&s;ent of councils, being turned into laws, were made nece&s;&s;ary, and ea&s;ily ju&s;tified in the following ages of ignorance and barbari&s;m. In the mean while the Bi&s;hops of Rome, who had always po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a great &s;hare of authority in church-affairs, being di&s;en|gaged from the rival&s;hip of the cities of A&s;ia and Egypt, as al&s;o of Con&s;tantinople, which had a&s;pired to the &s;ame &s;upremacy, erected a certain &s;piritual king|dom, u&s;urped the &s;upreme power, appointed Cardi|nals as their a&s;&s;ertors or coun&s;ellors; and &s;o laid the foundation of a long &s;eries of &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in that domi|nion;
<PB N="104" REF="113">none at fir&s;t oppo&s;ing their preten&s;ions, becau&s;e many of the European nations had received the Chri&s;|tian religion, by the in&s;truction of &s;uch as were &s;ent to them from Rome. This is the rea&s;on why the Latin or Romi&s;h church has introduced its cu&s;toms and languages into the churches of &s;o many other countries.</P>
<P>The&s;e Bi&s;hops, now called Popes, having once u&s;urped authority in divine matters, &s;oon proceeded to pub|bli&s;h new decrees, to interpret the old, and to debar the common people from the u&s;e of the &s;criptures, pretending that it would be of very dangerous con&s;e|quences, if religion, the mo&s;t important thing in the world, &s;hould be &s;ubjected to the &s;en&s;ele&s;s curio&s;ity of the vulgar.</P>
<P>By the&s;e methods they &s;o ordered matters that every thing was calculated for their own honour and profit.

<P>One very con&s;iderable furtherance of the reforma|tion, was the invention of printing, about the year 1400, or &s;omewhat later, when Laurence John&s;on Ko&s;ter found out the art of compo&s;ing letters or printing, which &s;oon filled the world with great num|ber of books; and the Bible, but tolerably written in vellum, which co&s;t no le&s;s than four or five hundred crowns, might now be bought for &s;ixty, and in a very few years for four or five; thus the vulgar, who could not reach the price of manu&s;cript Bibles, found it ea&s;y to read the holy &s;criptures in print; and hither was the re&s;ource of the fir&s;t reformers, to find out tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary truths and duties, on which &s;alvation de|pends,

<P>A. D. 1415.] Jerom of Prague is very ju&s;tly ranked among&s;t the promoters of the reformation.</P>
<P>At the clo&s;e of the la&s;t century, there aro&s;e a reli|gious controver&s;y in England, concerning &s;undry errors of Popery, by that great reformer John Wickliffe, and was from thence conveyed from England into Germany, where it kindled great commotions, both in church and &s;tate, but was neverthele&s;s attended with the&s;e two happy effects; it put men upon the &s;tudy of u&s;eful learning, and chiefly upon &s;earching into the holy &s;cripture and tradition; and it obliged the prelates to labour after the reformation of the manners of Chri&s;tians, and of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>Jerom of Prague was the companion and co mar|tyr of Dr. Hu&s;s. He was educated in that univer&s;ity, where he was admitted Ma&s;ter of Arts, having ac|quired great proficiency in all liberal endowments, and from a thorough conviction of the nece&s;&s;ity of a reformation in the Romi&s;h church, and that he might promote this, with greater &s;ucce&s;s, as well as being at that time accu&s;ed of making di&s;turbances at Hail|delberg, he went over to England, were he copied great part of the writings of Wickliffe, on the mo&s;t material points in di&s;pute, and returned with them to Prague. Jerom was cited before the council of Con|&s;tance, the &s;eventeenth of April 1415, when his friend Dr. Hu&s;s was confined in a ca&s;tle near that city. He arrived at Con&s;tance the &s;ame month, when he was informed how his friend had been treated, and that he al&s;o would be &s;eized: he went to Iberlingen, an imperial city, from whence he wrote to the Em|peror and council, to de&s;ire a &s;afe conduct, and one was pre&s;ented him: after this he began his journey into Bohemia; but as he was returning to Bohemia,
<PB N="109" REF="118">he was &s;topt at Hir&s;chru, and brought back to Con|&s;tance, and the next day carried as a pri&s;oner before the council, when, by the &s;trong importunity of friends, he was prevailed on to &s;ign a public abjuration. This, as <HI>Guthrie</HI> informs us, was precipitately complied with, of which he &s;incerely repented, and upon re|collection he rea&s;&s;umed a magnanimity and fortitude equal to the exigence of his ca&s;e.&mdash;Poggius a&s;&s;erts, that he &s;poke with a quickne&s;s of &s;entiment, &s;uch a dignity of expre&s;&s;ion, and &s;uch &s;trength of argument, that he &s;eemed to equal the noble&s;t of the ancient compo&s;itions. When &s;ome members of the council called out for him to put in his an&s;wers, he told the a&s;&s;embly that the ob|jections again&s;t him were the effects of prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and prejudice; that therefore, in ju&s;tice, they &s;hould permit him to lay open the whole tenor of his doctrine, life, and conver&s;ation, whereby he could indubitably wea|ken and invalidate all the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which ignorant zeal and open malice had rendered too &s;trong again&s;t him, in his unhappy condition. He was told he could not expect &s;uch indulgence. This exhau&s;ted his pa|tience, and he exclaimed to the whole a&s;&s;embly in the&s;e terms: "What barbarity is this! For three hundred and forty days have I been through all the variety of pri&s;ons: there is not a mi&s;ery, there is not a want, that I have not experienced; to my enemies you have allowed the fulle&s;t &s;cope of accu&s;ation; to me you deny the lea&s;t opportunity of defence; not an hour will you indulge me in preparing for my trial; you have &s;wallowed the blacke&s;t calumnies again&s;t me; you have repre&s;ented me as a heretic, without knowing what is my doctrine; as an enemy to the faith, before you know what faith I profe&s;&s;ed; and as a per&s;ecutor of prie&s;ts, before you could have any opportunity of under&s;tanding my &s;entiments on that head.

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of</HI> ULRICUS ZUINGLIUS.</HEAD>
<P>Ulricus Zuinglius, &s;tiled the reformer of Switzer|land, was born the fir&s;t of January 1487, at Wilder|hau&s;en. He received the fir&s;t rudiments of learn|ing at Ba&s;il, and afterwards acquired much greater proficiency in the Greek and Hebrew at Bern, &s;tudied philo&s;ophy at Vienna, and then returned to Ba&s;il, and &s;tudied divinity, where he commenced Doctor in that &s;cience in 1505. He was &s;oon after invited to Glaris, where he continued till 1516, and acquired great re|putation as a preacher: he was &s;oon after invited to Zurich, where with great a&s;&s;iduity he endeavoured to explain the &s;criptures, oppo&s;ing the errors of the church of Rome, &s;poke in favour of many of the tenets of Luther, which he &s;tiled evangelical truths; and con|ducted the reformation in Switzerland, with as much progre&s;s as Luther had done in Saxony, though he carried him&s;elf with more moderation and pru|dence. He propounded his doctrine in his &s;ermons, which he preached four years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in Zurich, and thereby prepared the minds of the people for its reception; but he would not attempt to make any al|teration in the divine wor&s;hip without the concurrence of the magi&s;trates, and he cau&s;ed an a&s;&s;embly to be
<PB N="111" REF="120">called for that purpo&s;e by the &s;enate of Zurich, on the 29th of January 1523, that the differences among preachers, in matters of religion, might be compo&s;ed. The a&s;&s;embly met upon the day appointed, when a great number of the clergy appeared; and the Bi&s;hop of Con&s;tance &s;ent three deputies, among whom was John Fabir, his chief vicar. The Con&s;ul opened the conference, by declaring, that the &s;ermons of Zuinglius had rai&s;ed &s;o many di&s;putes in their city, that the &s;e|nate thought it the be&s;t way to allay the&s;e differences, by appointing a conference before the council of two hundred, to which all the clergy, both of the city and country, had been &s;ummoned. Zuinglius replied, "That the light of the go&s;pel had been ob&s;cured, and almo&s;t extingui&s;hed, by human traditions; but that &s;everal eminent men had lately endeavoured to re|&s;tore it, by preaching the word of God to the people in its purity: that he was one of that number, and, like them, had been treated as an heretic and &s;educer; tho' he had, for five years pa&s;t, taught only what was contained in the holy &s;cripture: that it was for this rea&s;on he had de&s;ired to give an account of his doc|trine before the &s;enate of Zurich, and the Bi&s;hop of Con&s;tance: that he thanked the &s;enate for granting him this favour, and that he had drawn his doctrine into &s;ixty-&s;even propo&s;itions, which, he was fully per|&s;uaded, were agreeable to the go&s;pel; and he was ready to an&s;wer for him&s;elf, if any per&s;on would accu&s;e him of error or here&s;y." The doctrine contained in the&s;e &s;ixty-&s;even propo&s;itions may be reduced to the fol|lowing articles. That the go&s;pel is the only rule of faith: the church is the communion of &s;aints; we ought to acknowledge no other head of the church but Je&s;us Chri&s;t: all traditions &s;hould be rejected: there is no other &s;acrifice but that of Je&s;us Chri&s;t: we have no need of any other interce&s;&s;or with God than Je&s;us Chri&s;t: all &s;orts of meats may be eaten at all times: the habits of the monks &s;mell of hypocri&s;y: marriage
<PB N="112" REF="121">is allowable to all men; and no man is obliged to make a vow of cha&s;tity, nor are prie&s;ts at all obliged to live unmarried: excommunication ought not to be in|flicted by the Bi&s;hop alone, but by the whole church, and notorious offenders only ought to be excommuni|cated: the power which the Pope and Bi&s;hops a&s;&s;umes to them&s;elves, is a piece of pride, that has no founda|tion in the &s;cripture: God alone can forgive &s;ins; for confe&s;&s;ion of &s;in to a prei&s;t, is only to beg his gho&s;tly advice: and works of &s;atisfaction proceed from human tradition; and that the &s;cripture does not teach us, that there is &s;uch a place as purgatory."</P>
<P>Zuinglius offered publickly to debate the&s;e points, which was accepted by Fabir; when he oppo&s;ed &s;uch arguments in favour of the holy &s;criptures, as the rule of faith and practice, &s;hewing, that there was no men|tion made of the interce&s;&s;ion of &s;aints; and that if coun|cils were fallible, whether their traditions and cu&s;toms ought not to be rejected, when they are not grounded upon the authority of holy &s;cripture? Fabir re&s;ted his an&s;wers upon the authority of the church and councils; but Zuinglius would abide only by the &s;criptures. The debates however ended, and the &s;enate of Zurich publi&s;hed an edict, whereby it was ordained, that Zunglius &s;hould continue to teach and preach the go&s;|pel, and the word of God, in his u&s;ual manner; and all pa&s;tors and teachers were enjoined not to preach any thing that could not be proved by the go&s;pel and holy &s;cripture. Thus his endeavours proved, in great mea&s;ure, effectual, for the extirpation of Popi&s;h errors. He died in the year 1531.</P>
<P>The reformers at this time cen&s;ured other gro&s;s cor|ruptions. Simony had been an ancient and frequent complaint again&s;t the church of Rome. Exorbitant de|mands were early made for the advancement of a Bi&s;hop to that dignity. Athana&s;ius, Bi&s;hop of The&s;&s;alonica, depo&s;ited 60,000 crowns for his promotion to that &s;ee; be&s;ides which, the mini&s;ters of &s;tate demanded exorbitant fees; &s;o that the Patriarchs have been long &s;ince kept
<PB N="113" REF="122">in a tributary, dependent, and even precarious &s;tate, liable, on the lea&s;t failure in their payments, to be de|po&s;ed. Such, we may add, are the genuine cau&s;es of that &s;imony which is &s;o general among&s;t their eccle|&s;ia&s;tics. The Patriarchs &s;ell the mitre to the Bi&s;hop; the Bi&s;hop, his ordinations; the prie&s;t, the &s;acraments, ma&s;s, confe&s;&s;ions, ab&s;olutions, &amp;c. and many other pious frauds are continually practi&s;ed in that church, to the di&s;grace of eccle&s;ia&s;tical dignities, the &s;ource of contentions, and of many revolutions, which have taken place among&s;t the prelates of that ancient Papal church.</P>
<P>A. D. 1445.] The clergy having it now in their power, carry on a &s;piritual trade, that of indul|gences, and ma&s;&s;es for the &s;oul, both of them inexhau&s;ti|ble golden mines.

<P>A.

Among others, the &s;cheme of &s;elling indulgences was &s;ugge&s;ted to him, as an expedient which had often &s;erved in former times to draw money from the Chri&s;tian world, and make devout people willing contributors to the grandeur and riches of the church. The church was &s;uppo&s;ed to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a great &s;tock of merit, as being entitled to all the good works of the &s;aints, beyond what was nece&s;&s;ary for their own

<PB N="116" REF="125">again&s;t; and finding his opinions greedily hearkened to, he promulgated them by writing, di&s;cour&s;es, con|ferences, &amp;c. and daily increa&s;ed the number of his di&s;ciples. All Saxony, all Germany, all Europe, were in a very little time filled with the voice of this daring innovator; and men, rou&s;ed from that lethargy in which they had &s;o long &s;lept, began to enquire into, and con&s;equently to reject, &s;ome long received opinions. The Elector of Saxony, favourable to Luther's doc|trine, protected him from the violence of the Papal juri&s;diction. The republic of Zurich even reformed their churches, according to the new model: many Sovereigns of the empire, and the imperial diet it&s;elf, &s;hewed a favourable di&s;po&s;ition towards it: and Luther, a man naturally inflexible and vehement, was incapa|ble of being allured by promi&s;es, or terrified by threats, to relinqui&s;h the cau&s;e he had e&s;pou&s;ed.</P>
<P>The rumour of this attempt to reform the church &s;oon reached England; and as there &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in this kingdom great numbers of the Lollards, who&s;e principles re&s;embled tho&s;e of Luther, the&s;e prin|ples, and the parties, greatly increa&s;ed among all ranks and denominations. Henry had been educated in a &s;trict attachment to the church of Rome, and he bore no &s;mall prejudice again&s;t Luther, who, in his writings, had &s;poke with contempt of Thomas Aquinas, the King's favourite author. He oppo&s;ed him&s;elf, therefore, to the progre&s;s of the Lutherian tenets, by all the influence which his exten&s;ive and almo&s;t ab&s;o|lute authority conferred upon him. He wrote a book in Latin, again&s;t the principles of Luther, of which he &s;ent a copy to Leo, who received &s;o magnificent a pre&s;ent with great te&s;timony of regard, and conferred on him the title of <HI>Defender of the Faith,</HI> an appella|tion &s;till retained by the Kings of England. Luther &s;oon wrote an an&s;wer to Henry, and, without any re|gard to the dignity of his antagoni&s;t, treated him with &s;ome degree of acrimony in his &s;tile. The King wrote a farther an&s;wer to him; but the public greatly in|clined
<PB N="117" REF="126">to favour the opinions of Luther, attributed to him the victory in the di&s;pute; and new converts were daily acquired in every part of Europe.</P>
<P>The &s;urpri&s;ing progre&s;s of this &s;ect may, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, be attributed to the late invention of printing, and revival of learning; and as copies of the &s;criptures, and other antient monuments of the Chri&s;tian faith, became more common, men perceived the innovations that were introduced after the fir&s;t three centuries. Many of the powers a&s;&s;umed indeed by the church of Rome were very antient, and were prior to almo&s;t every political government e&s;tabli&s;hed in Europe. But as the eccle&s;ia&s;ticks would not &s;ubmit to po&s;&s;e&s;s their privileges as matters of civil right, which time would render valid, but appealed &s;till to a divine origin, men were tempted to look into their primitive charter, and they could, without much difficulty, perceive its defect, in truth and authenticity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Hume's hi&s;tory, vol. i.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Luther particularly inveighed again&s;t the abu&s;es of the court of Rome, with which men were at that time in general di&s;contented, and exhorted Princes to rein|&s;tate them&s;elves in tho&s;e powers, of which the incroach|ing &s;pirit of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, and e&s;pecially of the Sove|reign Pontiff, had &s;o long bereaved them. He con|demned celibacy and mona&s;tic vows; blamed the ex|ce&s;&s;ive riches, the idlene&s;s, the libertini&s;m of the clergy; and as the eccle&s;ia&s;tics had hitherto conducted a willing and &s;tupid audience, and were totally unacquainted with controver&s;y, and every &s;pecies of literature, they were unable to defend them&s;elves again&s;t men armed with authorities, and proper citations on popular topics.</P>
<P>In the mean time the progre&s;s again&s;t Luther being carried on at Rome, the Pope &s;ummoned him to ap|pear there in &s;ixty days; but fearing he &s;hould be condemned at Rome, he publi&s;hed a prote&s;tation in form of law, and appealed to a general council.</P>
<PB N="118" REF="127">
<P>In 1520, Luther &s;ent his book <HI>De Libertate Chri&s;ti|ana</HI> to the Pope, wherein he grounds ju&s;tification upon faith, and a&s;&s;erts his Chri&s;tian liberty, re&s;cued from the bondage of human traditions, and particularly the &s;lavery of popi&s;h impo&s;itions, and afterwards denies the authority of the church of Rome.</P>
<P>The Pope, irritated at this, began to apply his la&s;t remedies, condemned his book, and had it burnt, ex|communicated him, and &s;ent the bull to the Elector of Saxony, and the univer&s;ity of Wirtemberg, who a|greed to defer the publication of it. In the mean time Luther wrote again&s;t the bull, with great warmth and freedom, and appealed once more from the Pope to a general council, and publickly burnt the bull with his own hands at Wirtemberg.</P>
<P>The Emperor Charles V. declared again&s;t Luther, and ordered his books to be burnt. Upon opening the diet of Worms, Luther appeared there, and made a &s;peech in defence of him&s;elf. This was by the Em|peror's leave; but when the Emperor found he was not to be influenced by the deci&s;ion of councils, Luther was put under the ban of the empire, as a &s;chi&s;matic: but the Duke of Saxony gave private orders to convey him to the ca&s;tle of We&s;berg, where he remained con|cealed for three quarters of a year. This he calls his i&s;le of Patmos, and here he wrote &s;everal books, par|ticularly again&s;t <HI>Auricular Confe&s;&s;ion, Private Ma&s;&s;es, Mona&s;tic Vows,</HI> and the <HI>Celibacy of the Clergy.</HI> About this time the univer&s;ity of Paris condemned one hun|dred propo&s;itions taken out of his books; and King Henry VIII. of England wrote again&s;t him, in defence of the &s;even &s;acraments: to which he replied, both to the Sorbonne and the King of England.</P>
<P>Soon after Luther broke from his retirement, and ventured to publi&s;h a bull again&s;t the Pope's bull, and publi&s;hed part of his tran&s;lation of the Bible, in which he departed from the <HI>Vulgate,</HI> &s;o long authori&s;ed and received by the church.</P>
<PB N="119" REF="128">
<P>In 1521, the Elector of Saxony, who had all along fa|voured and protected Luther, now gave him leave to re|form the churches of Wirtemberg as he thought fit: and the &s;ame year had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee a league con|tracted between Gu&s;tavus, King of Sweden, and Fre|deric King of Denmark; who both agreed to e&s;tabli&s;h Lutherani&s;m in their dominions; and now Luther's per&s;ua&s;ion, which from the Upper Saxony had &s;pread it&s;elf into the northern provinces, began to be perfectly &s;ettled in the duchies of Lunenburg, Brun&s;wick, Mecklenburgh, and Pomerania, and in the Arch|bi&s;hopricks of Magdeburgh and Bremen, and in the towns of Hamburgh, Wi&s;mar, Ro&s;tock, and all along the Baltic, as far as Livonia and Pru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>Luther now left off the habit of a monk, and refu&s;ed the title of Reverend Father, and married a nun; ex|horting all eccle&s;ia&s;tics and monks to follow his ex|ample.</P>
<P>In 1526, Philip, Landgrave of He&s;&s;e, turned Lu|theran, which gave great life and vigour to this party.</P>
<P>In March 1529, the diet of Spire decreed, that Ca|tholicks &s;hould not have liberty to change their reli|gion, and that the Lutherans &s;hould deliver nothing in their &s;ermons contrary to the received doctrines of the church. The Lutheran Princes entered a &s;olemn pro|te&s;tation again&s;t this decree, from whence came the name of Prote&s;tants, taken up fir&s;t by the Lutherans, and afterwards received among the Calvini&s;ts.</P>
<P>Mr. Chambers has given us the following account of the progre&s;s of the doctrines of Luther, with &s;ome other remarkable particulars, viz. The fir&s;t who re|ceived Lutherani&s;m were the people of Mansfeld and the Saxons; it was preached at Kreich&s;aw in 1521; it was received at Go&s;lar, Ro&s;tock, Riga in Livonia, Rent|ling, and at Hall in Suabia, at Aug&s;burg, Hamburg, Treptow, and in Pomerania, in 1522; in Pru&s;&s;ia in 1523; at Einbech in the duchy of Lunenburg, at Nuremberg and Bre&s;law, in 1525; in He&s;&s;e 1526, at
<PB N="120" REF="129">Aldenburg, Stra&s;burg, and Brun&s;wick, in 1528; at Gottingen, Lemgou, and Lunenburg, in 1530; at Mun&s;ter, and Paderborn, in We&s;tphalia, in 1532; at Ethlingen, and Ulm, in 1533; in the duchy of Grubenhagen, at Hanover, and in Pomerania, in 1534; in the Duchy of Wirtemburg in 1535; at Cothus, in the Lower Lu&s;ace, in 1537; in the county of Lippe in 1538; in the electorate of Brandenburg, in Bremen, Hall in Saxony, Leip&s;ic in Mi&s;nia, and at Quedlenburg, in 1539; at Embden in Ea&s;t Fri&s;eland, Hailbron, Halber&s;tadt, and Magdeburg, in 1540; in the Palatinate of the Duchy of Newburg, at Regen&s;|burg and Wi&s;&s;mar, in 1542; at Buxtende, Hilde&s;heim, and at O&s;naburg, in 1543; at the Lower Palatinate in 1546; in Mecklenburg, in 1552; in the Marqui&s;ate of Durlach, and that of Hochburg, in 1556; in the county of Bentheim in 1564; at Haguenaw, and in the Lower Marqui&s;ate of Baden, in 1568; and in the Duchy of Magdeburg in 1570.</P>
<P>Lutherani&s;m has undergone &s;ome alterations &s;ince the time of its founder. Luther rejected the epi&s;tle of St. James, as incon&s;i&s;tent with the doctrine of St. Paul, in relation to ju&s;tification; he al&s;o &s;et a&s;ide the apoca|lyp&s;e: both which are now received as canonical in the Lutheran church. Luther reduced the &s;acraments to two, viz. bapti&s;m and the euchari&s;t; but he be|lieved the impanation, or con&s;ub&s;tantiation, that is, the matter of the bread and wine, remain with the body and blood of Chri&s;t; and it is in this article that the main difference between the Lutheran and Engli&s;h churches con&s;i&s;ts. Luther maintained the ma&s;s to be no &s;acrifice, exploded the adoration of the ho&s;t, au|ricular confe&s;&s;ion, meritorious works, indulgences, pur|gatory, the wor&s;hip of images, &amp;c. which had been introduced in the corrupt times of the Romi&s;h church. He al&s;o e&s;pou&s;ed the doctrine of free-will, denied prede&s;tination, a&s;&s;erted that we are not nece&s;&s;itated in all that we do, that all our actions done in a &s;tate of
<PB N="121" REF="130">&s;in, and involuntary, are pardonable on repentance; but &s;ome of his adherents a&s;&s;erted that we are only ju&s;tified by the imputation of the merits and &s;anctifi|cation of Chri&s;t: Some authors reckon thirty-nine different &s;ects which at different times have &s;prung up among the Lutherans.</P>
<P>The chief difference between the Lutherans and Calvini&s;ts is, that the Lutherans have Bi&s;hops and Superintendants for the government of the church,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Calvin and Lu|ther com|pared.</NOTE> whereas the Calvini&s;t clergy are all equal, and govern their churches by a Pre&s;by|tery. They al&s;o differ about the corporal pre|&s;ence, in the &s;acrament of the Lord's Supper: the Lutherans hold con&s;ub&s;tantiation; but the Calvini&s;ts e&s;teem this &s;acrament only a commemoration of our Saviour's death. The Lutherans likewi&s;e look upon man as a free agent; but the Calvini&s;ts maintain, that all his actions are decreed, and that he has no freedom of choice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Salmon, p. 171.</NOTE>. Calvin differed not much as to other points of faith; he held the &s;ame principles as to imputative ju&s;tice, and the certainty of our ju&s;tification by faith, which he extended even to an a&s;&s;urance of eternal &s;alvation. He al&s;o added an impo&s;&s;ibility of falling finally from grace, and the &s;alvation of the children of believers, who die before they have been bapti&s;ed. He likewi&s;e condemned, with more &s;everity than the Lutherans, the invocation of &s;aints, the wor&s;hip and u&s;e of images, vows, celibacy of prie&s;ts, fa&s;ting, holy days, &s;acrifice of the ma&s;s, adoration of the eu|chari&s;t, indulgences, and all the &s;acraments, except bapti&s;m and the Lord's Supper<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dupin, p. 184.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To &s;top the progre&s;s of Luther's doctrine, the univer&s;ities of Louvain and Cologne, which had already condemned him, burnt his book. He, on the contrary, burnt the Pope's bull of excommunication, together with the papal decretal: after this he was
<PB N="122" REF="131">cited to the diet of Worms, where he went very much again&s;t his friends con&s;ent, &s;etting before him the fate of John Hu&s;s; but nothing of that kind di&s;mayed him. When he came there, he bravely defended him&s;elf, refu&s;ing to retract any thing he had &s;aid, unle&s;s he could be confuted by &s;cripture. The Bi&s;hop of Triers asking him, what were the propere&s;t means to heal the&s;e evils, he an&s;wered, Tho&s;$ which Gamaliel propo&s;ed to the Jews. But the Emp$$$$ Charles V. being &s;et on by the creatures of the Pope, put Luther under the ban of the empire; but Frederic the Elector of Saxony &s;e|creted him a long while in a certain ca&s;tle, and after|wards publickly defended him. Placarts were now put in u&s;e. The fir&s;t, publi&s;hed in the&s;e provinces again&s;t Luther, his doctrine, books and followers, was in the year 1521.</P>
<P>Another placart was publi&s;hed at Mecklin again&s;t Lutherani&s;m, March 14, 1526.</P>
<P>Another in 1529.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of</HI> ERASMUS.</HEAD>
<P>Era&s;mus is generally ranked among&s;t the reformers. He was born on the twenty-eighth of October 1467, at Rotterdam; he pro&s;ecuted his &s;tudies both in Eng|land and el&s;ewhere, &s;o that he became a per&s;on of great repute in the &s;cripture, and was created Doctor of Divinity in Bononia. Notwith&s;tanding, though he &s;aw through the errors of the church of Rome, he conti|nued a member of that church, and rather contented him&s;elf with &s;ome efforts, for the promotion of peace and charity, among Chri&s;tians of different &s;entiments, than attempt the laborious ta&s;k of reformation.</P>
<P>Having been a&s;ked, &s;ays Dr. Jortin, whether I would decide the que&s;tion, what was the religion of Era&s;|mus? I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that Era&s;mus, if he had had an ab&s;olute power to e&s;tabli&s;h a form of religion in any country, would have been a moderate man, and a latitudinarian. As to the Credenda, he would have propo&s;ed few articles of faith, and tho&s;e with a primitive &s;implicity. Era&s;mus &s;aid, that Ariani&s;m was rather a faction and a &s;chi&s;m, than a here&s;y; and that Arius was ill u&s;ed by the con&s;ub&s;tantiali&s;ts. He al&s;o defended the doctrine of &s;ubordination, and there|fore hath been fal&s;ely accu&s;ed of Ariani&s;m by many ec|cle&s;ia&s;ticks. But a man may act like Era&s;mus, with|out being a perfidious per&s;on, and an apo&s;tate, with|out &s;inning again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, and without doing violence to his con&s;cience. This worthy man &s;pent a
<PB N="124" REF="133">long and laborious life, in an uniform pur&s;uit of two points; in oppo&s;ing barbarous ignorance, and blind &s;uper&s;tition, and in promoting u&s;eful literature and true piety. The&s;e glorious pro&s;pects he endeavoured to accompli&s;h in a mild and gentle manner, never attacking the per&s;ons of men, but only the faults of the age, until hard nece&s;&s;ity con&s;trained him to reply to tho&s;e who a&s;&s;aulted him with the utmo&s;t malice and di&s;ingenuity. It cannot be denied, that, taking all things together, Era&s;mus was what they call a Catholic; but he did not &s;ee, without joy, the fir&s;t &s;teps of Luther, and was greatly concerned when he thought Lutheri&s;m near its ruin. There is no ne|ce&s;&s;ity to &s;uppo&s;e, that Era&s;mus acted again&s;t his con|&s;cience in adhering to the church of Rome; he declares his hatred of di&s;cord to &s;uch, that he di&s;liked even truth it&s;elf, if it was &s;editious; he acknowledges he had no inclination to die for the &s;ake of truth. He flouri&s;hed about the year 1520, and died about the year 1536<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jortin's Life of Era&s;mus, p. 1. &amp; &s;eq.</NOTE>.</P>

In 1529, he was made pa&s;tor of the reformed at Bremgardton, but was &s;oon after by per&s;ecution driven from thence; and during his retirement Bullin|ger wrote a book, to &s;hew that the council of Trent had another de&s;ign, than to oppre&s;s the truth; and for many years afterward employed him&s;elf in de|fending the reformation. His zeal, however, was not confined to matters of importance, the holy doctrine of the ubiquity of God, and other &s;chola&s;tic points, too much engro&s;&s;ed his attention, and he adopted &s;ome other &s;entiments, no ways favourable to the prin|cipal bu&s;ine&s;s of the reformation.

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of</HI> JOHN CALVIN.</HEAD>
<P>John Calvin was born at Soi&s;&s;ons, a city of France, June 6, 1509. His father's name was Gerard Calvin, who gave his &s;on a liberal education.</P>
<PB N="132" REF="143">
<P>From the grammar-&s;chool, he &s;ent him to Paris, and placed him with Maturinus Corderius, a man well e&s;teemed both for probity and learning.</P>
<P>His father, from the beginning, de&s;igned him for the &s;tudy of divinity, which he judged him to be much inclined to, being religiou&s;ly addicted from his child|hood. He procured a benefice of the bi&s;hop for him, in Soi&s;&s;ons, in which place John, before his ordination, preached divers &s;ermons to the people. But this purpo&s;e of his was afterwards altered; for his father, &s;eeing the &s;tudy of the law was the &s;urer &s;tep to riches and honour, altered his mind, and his &s;on, growing into acquaintance with a certain kin&s;|man of his, was by him in&s;tructed in the true reli|gion, whereupon he applied him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of the &s;acred &s;criptures, and began to abominate the &s;u|per&s;titious &s;ervices in the Popi&s;h church.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he was employed in the&s;e &s;tudies, he ne|glected not that of divinity, &s;o that he preached divers &s;ermons in a neighbouring town. But, whil&s;t he was thus bu&s;ied, news came to him of his father's death, which called him back into his own country. Having &s;ettled his affairs there, he went to Paris, being now about twenty-four years old. After a few months &s;tay at Paris, he grew acquainted with all that profe&s;&s;ed the reformed religion; and among&s;t the re&s;t, with Stephen Forgeus, a famous merchant, who after|wards &s;ealed the truth with his blood.</P>
<P>From henceforward, at the earne&s;t reque&s;t of all tho&s;e that held their private meetings in Paris, he laid a&s;ide all other &s;tudies, and wholly applied him&s;elf to that of divinity. At this time Nicholas Cope was rector of the Univer&s;ity at Paris; who, being to make an oration on All-&s;aints day, at the in&s;tigation of John Calvin, &s;pake of religion more purely and clearly than he u&s;ed to do. This the parliament of Paris was angry at, in&s;omuch that they cited him before them: but, as he went, &s;ome of his friends advi&s;ed him to
<PB N="133" REF="144">take heed of his adver&s;aries; whereupon he returned home, and, immediately after, left France, and went to Ba&s;il.</P>
<P>The officers, &s;ent by the parliament, &s;earching for Cope, went into Calvin's hou&s;e, who, by chance, not being at home, they ran&s;acked his &s;tudy, and among&s;t his papers found many of his friends letters, which had like to have endangered the lives of many. But it plea&s;ed God to divert that &s;torm, by the prudent and pious diligence of the Queen of Navarre, the only &s;i&s;ter of King Francis, a woman of an admirable wit, and exceeding tender of the profe&s;&s;ors of the reformed religion. She al&s;o &s;ent for Mr. Calvin to her court, u&s;ed him very honourably, and heard him gladly. But, Mr. Calvin finding Paris too hot for his abode, went to Xantonge, where, &s;ojourning with a friend, at his reque&s;t, he drew up &s;hort admonitions, which were di&s;per&s;ed among&s;t certain prie&s;ts, to be taught to their people, that &s;o their people might, by little and little, be drawn to &s;earching out the truth.</P>
<P>Mr. Calvin publi&s;hed a form of Chri&s;tian doctrine, and a catechi&s;m, containing the chief heads of reli|gion; and, a public &s;cribe reading them, the people of Geneva &s;wore together to tho&s;e heads of religion and di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time, ob&s;erving that there were many in France that knew, and were convinced of the truth, and yet indulged them&s;elves, as if it were enough that they re&s;erved their hearts for Chri&s;t, tho' they were pre&s;ent at the Popi&s;h &s;ervices, he publi&s;hed two elegant epi&s;tles: one, to exhort the flying idola|try: the other, of the Popi&s;h prie&s;thood. But whil&s;t he, Calvin, was thus employed, he met with grievous &s;editions at home.</P>
<P>The go&s;pel indeed was entertained, and Popery ab|jured in Geneva; but many were not reformed from the profane and &s;candalous cour&s;es which they had
<PB N="134" REF="145">learned of the Popi&s;h clergy; and the antient fends among&s;t the chief families were not yet laid a&s;ide. The&s;e, at fir&s;t, were gently admoni&s;hed, and, when that prevailed not, more &s;harply reprehended; and, when yet they continued &s;tubborn, and the city, by the factions of private per&s;ons, was divided into par|ties, Farrel, Calvin, and Caroldus, did openly profe&s;s, that they could by no means admini&s;ter the Lord's &s;upper to per&s;ons who were at &s;uch enmity among&s;t them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Upon this occa&s;ion the Syndies which were cho&s;en for that year at Geneva (who, for the time, are the chief magi&s;trates, a&s;&s;embling, the captains of the &s;$di|tious per&s;ons &s;o far prevailed, that the&s;e three worthy &s;ervants of Chri&s;t were commanded, within two days, to depart the city. When this decree was brought to Calvin, he &s;aid: "Truly, if I had &s;erved men, I &s;hould have had but an ill reward; but it is well that I have &s;erved him who doth always perform to his &s;ervants what he hath once promi&s;ed."</P>
<P>Calvin went to Ba&s;il, and thence to Stra&s;bourg; where, by the de&s;ire of the &s;enate, he was made pro|fe&s;&s;or of divinity, which place he di&s;charged with great applau&s;e of learned men; and, by the con&s;ent of the &s;enate, planted the French church there, and &s;ettled di&s;cipline in it. Calvin &s;ettled in another place, and a new church erected.</P>
<P>At this time Cardinal Sadolet, a man of great elo|quence, &s;eeing the flock deprived of &s;uch able and vigilant &s;hepherds, thought it a &s;it time to en&s;nare them; for which end he wrote letters, directed to his dear friends (as he called them) the &s;enate, council, and people of Geneva, in which he omitted no argu|ments, whereby he might per&s;uade them to return into the bo&s;om of the Romi&s;h church. There was no man in Geneva that would undertake to an&s;wer the &s;ame; &s;o that probably the&s;e letters would have done much mi&s;chief, but that they were written in a foreign language. But, when Calvin had read them, forgetting all the wrongs
<PB N="135" REF="146">which had been done him, he returned an an&s;wer &s;o &s;peedily and eloquently, that the Cardinal, de&s;pairing of accompli&s;hing his end, wholly gave over his de&s;ign.</P>
<P>Mr. Calvin continued at Stra&s;bourg to the year 1541. In which the Emperor Charles V. a&s;&s;embled two diets, the one at Worms, the other at Rati&s;bon, for compo&s;ing the differences about religion: at both which Mr. Calvin was pre&s;ent, to the great advan|tage of the churches, and where he was mo&s;t lovingly entertained by Philip Melancthon, and Ga&s;par Cruciger. He al&s;o had much private conference with them about the &s;acrament of the Lord's &s;upper, and they could not but approve of his opinion therein.</P>
<P>The city of Geneva began to call for Farrell and Calvin; but when, by no means, they could recover Farrell, they u&s;ed all their endeavours to procure Calvin; and, for that end, &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to Stra&s;bourg.</P>
<P>The &s;enate of Stra&s;bourg were exceeding unwilling to hearken to it; and Calvin him&s;elf, abhorring to enter into new troubles, and finding great &s;ucce&s;s at|tended his mini&s;try at Stra&s;bourg, did ab&s;olutely refu&s;e to return. Be&s;ides, Bucer, and the other pa&s;tors, did profe&s;s their great unwillingne&s;s to part with him.</P>
<P>But the Genevians &s;till pre&s;&s;ing hard for him, Bu|cer, at la&s;t, thought their reque&s;ts &s;hould be conde|&s;cended to. This falling out ju&s;t at the time when Calvin, with Bucer, was going to the diet at Rati&s;bon, his return was delayed for a time; when they cho&s;e Peter Viret: and, indeed, this made Mr Calvin far more willing to return, when he &s;aw that he was to have &s;uch a collegue.</P>
<P>Mr. Calvin went to Geneva, September the 13th 1541, being &s;ingularly welcomed by the people, and e&s;pecially by the &s;enate, who acknowledged the won|derful mercy of God towards them, in re&s;toring him to them. And whereas the &s;enate of Stra&s;bourg had decreed, that, after a time, he &s;hould return to them
<PB N="136" REF="147">again, that of Geneva would never give over, till they had rever&s;ed that decree, which, at la&s;t, was yielded to by them of Stra&s;bourg, yet with this provi&s;o, that the pen&s;ion, which they had &s;ettled upon him, &s;hould &s;till be continued to him. But Mr. Calvin could never be per&s;uaded to receive it, caring for nothing le&s;s than for riches. Mr. Calvin, being thus re&s;tored to his church, and perceiving that the city needed &s;uch bridles, he profe&s;&s;ed that he could not comfortably exerci&s;e his mini&s;try among&s;t them, except, together with the doctrine of the go&s;pel, that they would em|brace the Pre&s;byterian government, for the well re|gulating of the church. Hereupon elders were cho&s;en, and a model of government was drawn up.</P>
<P>His ordinary labours were the&s;e: every other Sabbath he preached twice; Monday, Tue&s;day, Wedne&s;day, he read his divinity-lectures: every Thur&s;day he a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the con&s;i&s;tory for the eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;cipline On Fridays he read a lecture for the clearing hard places of the &s;criptures; an&s;wered many adver&s;aries to the truth; wrote many letters to &s;undry places. So that we have cau&s;e to wonder how it was po&s;&s;ible for one man to undergo &s;o many bu&s;ine&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides his fore mentioned labours, he had al&s;o the charge and bu&s;ine&s;s of a family, and many foreign em|ployments; for God &s;o ble&s;&s;ed his mini&s;try, that, from all parts of the Chri&s;tian world, he was &s;ought to, partly for advice in matters of religion, and, partly, to hear him preach: &s;o that, at the &s;ame time, there was an Italian church, an Engli&s;h church, and a Spa|ni&s;h church, and the city &s;eemed too little to entertain all that came to it for his &s;ake.</P>
<P>In 1542, Mr. Calvin met with many afflictions, &s;ome at home, but e&s;pecially by the fury of the ad|ver&s;aries of the truth abroad in France and Italy, whence they drove away many profe&s;&s;ors of the go&s;pel, for the comfort of whom he laid him&s;elf out exceed|ingly, writing many encouraging letters every way,
<PB N="137" REF="148">both to tho&s;e that were e&s;caped, and to tho&s;e that yet remained within the lion's jaws.</P>
<P>In 1545 was that abominable and cruel edict which the parliament of Aquitaine &s;et forth again&s;t the poor Walden&s;es of Merindol, Cabriers, and tho&s;e parts; whereby unheard-of cruelties were exerci&s;ed, not again&s;t &s;ome few, but again&s;t all of them, without any di&s;tinc|tion of age or &s;ex.</P>
<P>Some of tho&s;e that e&s;caped, flying to Geneva, Calvin was the more afflicted for them, and careful of them, becau&s;e, a little before, he had written con|&s;olatory letters to them, and &s;ent them faithful pa&s;tors, and had al&s;o (where they were in danger before) pre|&s;erved them by his interce&s;&s;ion to the German princes.</P>
<P>In 1546, one of the &s;enators, in a public a&s;&s;embly of the people, blamed Calvin as one that taught fal&s;e doctrine, &s;uborned (as was &s;uppo&s;ed) by two of the college of pa&s;tors, both of them being drunkards, and, therefore, fearing the &s;everity of the laws. But Mr. Calvin made little account of this. Yet the man who accu&s;ed him was called before the &s;enate, and, his cau&s;e being heard, was condemned for &s;lander; and tho&s;e two drunken mini&s;ters, who had &s;et him on, were removed out of their places.</P>
<P>The year 1547 proved far wor&s;e; indeed that age &s;aw not a more calamitous time than that was: the churches of Germany &s;eemed to be utterly &s;ubverted, the Prote&s;tant Princes taken, and cities yielding up them&s;elves, after &s;o great labours u&s;ed, and &s;o great difficulties pa&s;&s;ed through, in planting the go&s;pel among&s;t them. With what grief Mr. Calvin was afflicted for the de&s;olations of the churches, is not ea&s;y to expre&s;s, e&s;pecially, if we con&s;ider that great affection which he bore to them, though far remote from him, which indeed was no other than if he had &s;upported them all upon his &s;houlders. Indeed he was wonderfully grieved when he heard of tho&s;e holy men, his worthy friends Philip Melancthon, Bucer,
<PB N="138" REF="149">Peter Martyr, &amp;c. in &s;o great danger that they &s;eemed nearer death than life.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e contentions, the church of Geneva did wonderfully increa&s;e, and Mr. Calvin was very &s;olicitous to entertain and provide for &s;uch as were bani&s;hed for the name of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>In the year 1550, the church of Chri&s;t enjoyed peace, and then it was decreed in Geneva, that the mini&s;ters, not only in their &s;ermons, which many neglected, and others heard with &s;mall profit, but, from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, &s;hould divide the city among&s;t them, and require of every family an account of their faith; by which means it is &s;carce credible what profit came to the people.</P>
<P>In the year 1553, Michael Servetus, having pub|li&s;hed a book filled with errors, was, at Vienna, ca&s;t into pri&s;on for the &s;ame. But, making an e&s;cape, he came to Geneva, thinking to pa&s;s further; but being di&s;covered, and Calvin acquainting the magi&s;trates with it, they ca&s;t him into pri&s;on. Many means were u&s;ed to bring him to repentance; but, when he would not be brought to recantation, he was condemned to death, and, upon the 27th of October, burned alive. This was no &s;mall reflection on the character of Calvin.</P>
<P>About this time a grievous calamity befel the church of England by the death of King Edward VI. which was a grievous wound to all the reformed churches.</P>
<P>Soon after, the care of the Engli&s;h exiles lay heavy upon him; &s;ome of them were come to Embden, and others to Frankfort, all &s;ending to Calvin for advice and coun&s;el. How great pains he took this year for &s;everal churches, may appear by the multitude of epi&s;tles wrote by him, by which he &s;tirred up many noblemen to embrace the go&s;pel, and &s;trengthened many of the brethren, &s;ome of whom were in extreme danger, and others already ca&s;t into bonds.</P>
<PB N="139" REF="150">
<P>At this time a grievous per&s;ecution ri&s;ing at Paris, it was a great affliction to Mr. Calvin; many being taken when they were a&s;&s;embled in St. James's Street, for the celebration of the Lord's &s;upper, being about eighty in number, the re&s;t e&s;caping by the benefit of the night; who, the next morning, were led to pri&s;on, loaden with &s;corns and reproaches, though &s;ome of them were noble women of good account.</P>
<P>There were al&s;o &s;ome fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es &s;uborned again&s;t them, which the credulous multitude were too apt to believe; there were, therefore, &s;even of them brought forth to be burned, among&s;t whom there was a noble woman, who, with &s;ix others, &s;hewed admirable pa|tience; and whereas they were accu&s;ed of promi&s;cuous whoredoms at their meetings, a learned man, who had lately been their pa&s;tor, ea&s;ily confuted tho&s;e lies; and the German Princes, interceding in their behalf (which Mr. Calvin procured with admirable celerity) the tem|pe&s;t was, in a good mea&s;ure, blown over.</P>
<P>A. D. 1559 was famous for the league entered into between the two mo&s;t potent kings of Spain and France, &s;trengthened by affinity betwixt them, which was like|ly to prove fatal to Geneva.</P>
<P>In the mean time Calvin (though &s;ickly) laboured hard, comforting the afflicted churches; as al&s;o by his frequent and fervent prayers, craving help of God. Whil&s;t all things were full of $$rror, the King of France, in the great marriage-&s;olemnity which was made for the confirmation of the peace, in his running at tilt, received his death's wound, and that by the hand of the captain of his guard, by whom, a little before, he had apprehended and impri&s;oned &s;everal &s;enators.</P>
<P>About this time the Bohemians &s;ent two of their brethren to Calvin, to de&s;ire his judgment about &s;ome matters of religion, whom he lovingly &s;atisfied, ex|horting them al&s;o that they would enter into a nearer con|junction with other reformed churches. At the &s;ame
<PB N="140" REF="151">time al&s;o, Queen Mary being dead, and Queen Elizabeth &s;ucceeding, many of the French, relying upon her piety and humanity, fled for refuge into England, with the con&s;ent of that reverend divine Edmund Grindal, Bi&s;hop of London; and craved leave of her, that one might be &s;ent from Geneva, to plant a French church there.</P>
<P>Towards the latter end of this year, King Francis, of France, died &s;uddenly, and that in &s;uch a juncture of time, when all things &s;eemed de&s;perate. King Charles IX. a child, was &s;carce entered on his reign, when, by a herald, letters, &s;ub&s;cribed with his name, were brought to Geneva, wherein he complained that many were &s;ent from thence, who infected his kingdom, de&s;iring that they might be pre&s;ently called back; threatening, that otherwi&s;e he would revenge that injury.</P>
<P>Calvin, being hereupon &s;ent for by the &s;enate, an|&s;wered in his own, and in his collegues names, that, at the reque&s;t of the churches of France, they had ex|horted certain men who were &s;ound in the faith, and of a holy life, that they &s;hould not be wanting to lend their help to their country in &s;o holy a cau&s;e; and that this they had done, not to di&s;turb the kingdom, but that the people might be taught the go&s;pel of peace; and, if they were accu&s;ed for any thing further than this, they were ready to an&s;wer their accu&s;ers before the King: &s;o this bu&s;ine&s;s went no further.</P>
<P>In the year 1562, God gave peace and liberty to the French churches, by a public edict of the Kings: but not long after the King of Navarre, pre&s;ently after the Duke of Gui&s;e had committed that abominable ma&s;&s;acre at Va&s;&s;y, began a civil war, which continued many years after, to the mi&s;erable deva&s;tation of France. It cannot be &s;poken how much Calvin was afflicted therewith, which &s;o far increa&s;ed his di&s;ea&s;e, that it was ea&s;y to divine, that it would not be long before he would be tran&s;lated to a better life; yet did he not de&s;i&s;t from exhorting and comforting every one, nor from preaching and reading his ordinary lectures.</P>
<PB N="141" REF="152">
<P>In the year 1563 his di&s;ea&s;e did much increa&s;e; yet, even then, he could not be per&s;uaded to ab&s;tain from his public labours: but when, by nece&s;&s;ity, he was obliged, he was bu&s;y at home, either in giving coun|&s;el to tho&s;e that &s;ought it, or in dictating to his &s;cribes.</P>
<P>In the year 1564, February 6, he preached his la&s;t &s;ermon, and from thenceforward &s;poke little, and would now and then be carried to the congregation. His di&s;ea&s;es, contracted by the incredible labours both of his mind and body, were many; for be&s;ides that, he was but of a weak body, lean, and inclinable to a con|&s;umption, &s;lept little, and &s;pent a great part of the year in preaching, teaching, and dictating. For at lea&s;t ten years together he ab&s;tained from dinners, taking no food at all till &s;upper, was often troubled with the head-a$h, which his ab&s;tinence only could cure. He was al&s;o troubled with the piles, which at length proved ulcerous, and for five years before his death did many times &s;pit blood; when his quartan ague left him, the gout took him, then the cholic, and la&s;tly the &s;tone.</P>
<P>The phy&s;icians applied what remedies they could, and though tormented with &s;o many di&s;ea&s;es, yet was never heard to utter one word unbecoming a Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>May the 27th, he &s;eemed to &s;peak more &s;trongly, and with le&s;s difficulty than u&s;ual; but this was but a lightening before death. In the evening, about eight o'clock, on a &s;udden, &s;igns of pre&s;ent death appeared, and &s;oon after yielded up his &s;pirit, without the lea&s;t &s;truggling, having had his under&s;tanding, memory, and voice, even to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>Calvini&s;m having began in Geneva in 1536, it prevailed not only in many parts of Germany, but even in France; and tho' Calvin died &s;oon after the per|&s;ecution commenced in France, the Helvetic body &s;trengthened that party, by a new confe&s;&s;ion of faith. The Calvini&s;t religion prevailed among the He&s;&s;ians, and in the &s;outh of Franconia, the &s;ix Prote&s;tant can|tons in Switzerland and their allies. Calvini&s;m is al&s;o
<PB N="142" REF="153">the religion of the reformed in France, the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion in the United Provinces, where all religions are tolerated; but the Pre&s;byterians only are admitted into any employment under the government. (Calvin|i&s;m was introduced into Scotland by Knox, in the reign of Queen Mary; who&s;e &s;on, James VI. e&s;tabli&s;h|ed Epi&s;copacy, which continued till 1668, when Epi&s;copacy was aboli&s;hed, and the Pre&s;bytery re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in that kingdom, without &s;o much as a tolera|tion for the members of the church of England, until the reign of Queen Anne.)</P>
<P>The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, and his court, are Calvini&s;ts; tho' his &s;ubjects are, for the mo&s;t part, Lutherans. The religion of this glorious Monarch is be&s;t known from his confe&s;&s;ion of faith; which he cau&s;ed to be ad|dre&s;&s;ed to all the Prote&s;tant mini&s;ters in the diet of the empire at Rati&s;bon in 1744, as follows:
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. I do not believe in the ordinances of the Pope, nor even in the writings of Luther, Beza, or Calvin; but believe in the adorable Trinity, and I make his holy word the foundation of my faith, nor &s;hall I ever believe any thing that cla&s;hes with it, even though an angel from heaven &s;hould reveal it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. I believe al&s;o that I &s;hall be &s;aved, together with all true Chri&s;tians, by the blood of Chri&s;t, his &s;uffer|ing and dying for us.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. As I profe&s;s there is no &s;alvation in any other name, I would not be &s;tiled a Lutheran, a Calvini&s;t, nor a Papi&s;t, but a Chri&s;tian.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. With regard to eternal election, or prede&s;tina|tion, this is my private opinion, that the merciful God hath called all men to &s;alvation; and it is not for want of being called if they are not &s;aved, but thro' their own wickedne&s;s and ob&s;tinacy in oppo&s;ing divine grace, and by rea&s;on of their corrupt hearts, and their &s;ins, that they are condemned through the ju&s;t judge|ment of God.</ITEM>
<PB N="143" REF="154">
<ITEM>V. As to good works, it is my opinion, that there mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be good works where there is a true faith; for faith and good works can no more be &s;epa|rated, than light from fire: neverthele&s;s it is an error to believe, that man can merit heaven by good works, or that he can be &s;aved but by true faith. How then can the merit of good works &s;ave us?</ITEM>
<ITEM>VI. With-regard to bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper, it is my opinion, that I have been wa&s;hed from &s;in in bapti&s;m; not by the water, but by the blood of my Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and have been by it received into the eternal covenant of grace with God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t: &s;o I am nouri&s;hed in the holy &s;upper at the table of the grace of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and, in virtue of this &s;acrament, am rendered partaker of all the benefits which my Saviour hath purcha&s;ed by his wounds and death, and am be|come an inheritor of life everla&s;ting; whence I believe, that who&s;o believed in God, and &s;eeketh his &s;alvation in the blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and leadeth a true Chri&s;|tian life, may die the death of the righteous, and &s;hall be &s;aved.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VII. I leave to every one liberty of faith and con|&s;cience; prote&s;ting, before the face of God, that I am determined to live and die in this plain confe&s;&s;ion of faith: neverthele&s;s, I leave to all good people to judge, whether I am cold, hot or lukewarm. I am very far from believing, that the &s;ervice of Catholic prie&s;ts promote the &s;alvation of &s;ouls; have learned by the experience which I have had, that all their actions tend not to the honour of God, and the &s;alvation of men, but &s;olely to their own honour, and to be re&s;pected among men.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VIII. It is with rea&s;on that I &s;cruple to be called a Papi&s;t, a Lutheran, or a Calvini&s;t; becau&s;e, accord|ing to the cu&s;tom and opinion of the world, it is not &s;ufficient to take the name of a Chri&s;tian, but we mu&s;t be engaged to &s;ome particular church, and make pro|fe&s;&s;ion
<PB N="144" REF="155">of its faith; and as the pure reformed religion be&s;t agrees with my religion, I think it not improper to call my&s;elf a Reformed; although I &s;ee no cau&s;e to &s;ay, there is the lea&s;t difference between my confe&s;&s;ion of faith and the pure Lutheran religion: I would not, however, be called a Calvini&s;t; but am, and &s;hall always be, a reformed Chri&s;tian: that is to &s;ay, one that is di&s;engaged from all error in the doctrine of faith, and who believes all that I have before mention|ed; but a Calvini&s;t is one, who makes the doctrine of Calvin the rule of his faith.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IX. As Calvin was a man, he might be mi&s;taken, &s;ince no man is perfect: but I regard Calvin, Luther, and others, as cho&s;en in&s;truments of God, drawn by virtue of the Holy Gho&s;t from the darkne&s;s of Popery, and that they &s;hewed the true way to life; but as they were fallible, I do not call them rabbies. I profe&s;s, not to believe any doctrine that is not agreeable to the word of God; believing that it is my duty, as St. Paul advi&s;es, to try all things, and hold fa&s;t that which is good.</ITEM>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of</HI> PHILIP MELANCTHON.</HEAD>
<P>Philip Melancthon was born in the year 1497, at Bretten, in the palatinate of the Rhine. He gave very early marks of his great capacity, and was ju&s;tly e&s;teemed an illu&s;trious youth. After pa&s;&s;ing through &s;everal branches of literature, in 1518, he accepted the Greek profe&s;&s;or&s;hip in the univer&s;ity of Whiten|burgh; but we find him principally remarkable, at this period, for his a&s;&s;iduity in promoting truth, in oppo&s;ition to prevailing error, notwith&s;tanding the ob|&s;tructions he met with from tho&s;e of the Romi&s;h reli|gion: for having had an acquaintance with Luther, he zealou&s;ly joined with him in oppo&s;ing the errors and &s;uper&s;titious practices of the Romi&s;h church. We find him likewi&s;e a cotemporary of Era&s;mus, and that
<PB N="145" REF="156">there was a very great friend&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ted betwixt them; yet, from his natural frankne&s;s of temper, he cen&s;ured his paraphra&s;es: but &s;o univer&s;ally was he ad|mired for his learning and integrity, that we find Car|dinal Bembus &s;hewed him&s;elf very &s;olicitous to &s;erve him, and offered, if that would have influenced him to continue a Papi&s;t, to obtain preferment for him in the church; but Melancthon declined it, and continu|ed the advocate for Prote&s;tanti&s;m, and, as far as in him lay, the promoter of peace. In 1541 he a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the conferences of Spires and Rati&s;bon, where the controver&s;ies between the Romani&s;ts and Prote&s;tants were warmly di&s;puted. At the former, the Papi&s;ts cho&s;e Eckius, and the Prote&s;tants appointed Melanc|thon, to confer about the points in controver&s;y, and agreed that they &s;hould di&s;cour&s;e about original &s;in. They entered upon it, and continued the conference three days; when Nicholas Granville, who was then prime mini&s;ter to the Emperor, and his commi&s;&s;ioner at the conference, received a letter from his Imperial Maje&s;ty, which ordered, that the conference &s;hould be di&s;continued, and all things referred to the diet of Rati&s;bon, where the Prote&s;tants were ordered to meet. This diet was opened in March, in the pre&s;ence of the Emperor, who appointed Eckius, P&s;lugius, and Grop|per, to manage it for the Romani&s;ts; and for the Prote&s;tants, Melancthon, Bucer, and Pi&s;torius. He commanded them to lay a&s;ide all pa&s;&s;ion, and to re|&s;pect the glory of God only in that conference. Fre|deric, the Elector palatine, was appointed pre&s;ident, who opened the conference on the 27th of April, when a writing was produced, which contained twenty-two articles, wherein the whole &s;ub&s;tance of religion was compri&s;ed. It was imagined, that this writing was drawn up by John Gropper; but the Emperor &s;aid, it was pre&s;ented to him by per&s;ons of learning and piety, to forward the peace: he therefore de&s;ired them to examine it, that they might approve of what was
<PB N="146" REF="157">well, correct what was ami&s;s, and terminate all diffe|rences.</P>
<P>In 1543, Melancthon went to the Elector of Co|logne, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in introducing a reformation into his dioce&s;e, and drew up &s;undry articles to pre&s;ent to the Elector, in which Bucer and Pi&s;torius a&s;&s;i&s;ted. This attempt engaged the Elector to renounce Popery, and to promote, as far as in him lay, a reformation in his electorate; but &s;uch was the jealou&s;y, the policy, and diligence of the Romi&s;h prie&s;ts, that it had very little &s;ucce&s;s with the common people, and he continued his &s;tudies, as profe&s;&s;or of divinity, in the univer&s;ity of Wittingburgh, where he died the 19th of April, 1560<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rolt's Hi&s;tory of the Reformers, p. 98.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Herman, Archbi&s;hop of Cologne, &s;ent for Melanc|thon and Bucer, with a de&s;ign to reform his dioce&s;e; which was attended with no &s;mall &s;ucce&s;s, till per&s;e|cution commenced on that account.</P>
<P>The council of Trent was, at this time, convened, and in their &s;econd &s;e&s;&s;ion entered upon the two grand points to be &s;ettled therein, viz. matters of faith, and a reformation. Cardinal Poole propo&s;ed, that &s;ince in all ancient councils, &s;ome &s;ymbol of faith was pub|li&s;hed, the like &s;hould be done in this; but concerning this &s;ymbol of faith there was &s;ome difficulty, &s;ince to recite the old would not convince the Lutherans, in|&s;inuating, that they believed it as well as the Catho|lics, but would not profe&s;s it, and urging, that this would imply they dur&s;t not handle the controverted points; it was re&s;olved by a majority, that a new form, or creed, &s;hould be propo&s;ed. In the next &s;e&s;&s;ion this new creed was barely recited; the court of Rome, under&s;tanding what had pa&s;&s;ed, and being alarmed at the name of reformation, as knowing not how far it might extend, u&s;ed their intere&s;t to oppo&s;e
<PB N="147" REF="158">it. The Prote&s;tants, about this time, appointed a diet, and conference of divines at Rati&s;bon; at which the point of ju&s;tification was very early brought upon the carpet, and divers other matters in religion, in which the members could not agree. The Duke of Saxe recalled his divines, and Martin Bucer returned to the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e, apprehending that the Emperor's intention was to amu&s;e them with confe|rences, while him&s;elf prepared for war; which, whe|ther it had exi&s;ted in his intention, was not fully known; but not long afterwards, expre&s;&s;ing his di&s;like at that diet breaking up, he made preparations for war, which &s;oon became known to the Prote&s;tants, &s;o that they likewi&s;e armed them&s;elves for defence. King Henry now made propo$als to them, for entering into a &s;olemn league with them, and for concerting &s;uch mea&s;ures with them, as &s;hould re&s;tore a much greater amity among&s;t them, and &s;trengthen their hands again&s;t their enemies. But the Germans, who knew at what di&s;tance the King lived, and having a &s;u&s;picion of &s;ome &s;ecret and &s;ini&s;ter views, did not much regard the pro|po&s;als made to them, but tru&s;ted to them&s;elves; and our King made peace with the French. The Emperor, at this time, making u&s;e of &s;undry artifices to conceal his intention of &s;uppre&s;ling a reformation, and to ca&s;t the blame of this war on the Prote&s;tants<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An ab&s;tract of a large account in L. Herbert, p. 613, 614, &amp; &s;eq.</NOTE>; but the Prote&s;tants were upon their guard, and exhorted one another to &s;tand firm.</P>
<P>The Cardinal of Trent, at this time, ab&s;olutely con|cluded a league with the Pope and the Emperor<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sleidem, lib. vii. L. Herbert, p. 622.</NOTE>. Both &s;ides prepared for war: the Emperor pretending, that for civil cau&s;es, acts of di&s;affection and rebellion, he took up arms again&s;t them; and they denying the allegations, profe&s;&s;ed their de&s;igns were &s;olely the &s;up|port
<PB N="148" REF="159">of their liberty in religion. The Duke of Saxe and Landgrave of He&s;&s;e, who commanded the Pro|te&s;tant army, compo&s;ed of 70,000 foot, and 10,000 hor&s;e, &s;ent a kind of defiance to the Emperor. The Emperor, hearing that our King treated with the Pro|te&s;tants, expo&s;tulated the matter with him; which his Maje&s;ty denied, or that he intended any aid to the Prote&s;tants: &s;aying, yet if he &s;ought friend&s;hip abroad, he was not to be blamed, &s;ince the Emperor, in his new treaty with the Bi&s;hop of Rome, had agreed to fall on all tho&s;e who rejected the &s;upremacy of the Bi&s;hop of Rome. In October this &s;ame year an en|gagement happened, in which the Imperiali&s;ts had the advantage, and the two commanders, the Duke of Saxe and the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e, being obliged to return home, for the &s;ecurity of their own provinces, Denawart, and &s;ome other towns in Germany, were obliged to &s;ubmit upon very hard terms. The Pope, upon hearing of what had pa&s;&s;ed, began to be &s;olicitous for his own intere&s;t, and urged, that he had not been properly con&s;ulted; that he was not made a partaker in the treaty betwixt the Emperor and &s;ome of the Princes in Germany; and that it was much to the prejudice of the Catholic faith in tolerating here&s;y, which ought ab&s;olutely to be exterminated Be&s;ides that, he ought to have partook of the profits and &s;poils of the war; and for farther te&s;timony of his di&s;plea&s;ure rai&s;ed a faction in Genoa again&s;t the Dorias, not fear|ing their being able to undertake any thing again&s;t him. In the mean time the council of Trent proceeded to &s;ettle, as well as they could, matters of religion: but this did not divert the Emperor from the pro&s;ecution of his intended war; and the Prote&s;tants were, as far as in their power, careful for their defence. They even &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to England and France for &s;uc|cour, but were refu&s;ed by both the Kings.</P>
<P>The Emperor appointed a diet of the empire to meet in the end of July, the de&s;ign of which was to
<PB N="149" REF="160">extingui&s;h the light of the go&s;pel, or check the pro|gre&s;s of the reformation; but St. Peter had taught the reformed Chri&s;tians, that it was better to obey God rather than man, and therefore they were re&s;olved to put all things upon the hazard, rather than to make &s;hipwreck of faith and a good con&s;cience, &s;o that great tumults were rai&s;ed in Stra&s;bourg, and divers other towns. A &s;evere edict was al&s;o publi&s;hed in Flanders again&s;t all that favoured the new doctrines, as they are called; but this was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, at the interce&s;&s;ion of the city of Antwerp, who had repre&s;ented, that the ruin and lo&s;s of their trade from the Engli&s;h was in &s;ome mea&s;ure, and would inevitably be the effect of it.</P>
<P>The famous O&s;iander having been obliged, from the troubles of tho&s;e times, to leave his church at Nu|remberg, fled into the kingdom of Pru&s;&s;ia, that was one of the provinces to Brandenburgh, the mo&s;t affec|tionate to the reformation by Luther; it belonged to the Teutonic order, but the Prince Albert of Bran|denburgh, who was the Grand Ma&s;ter thereof, con|ceived all at once a de&s;ire of marrying and reforming, and making him&s;elf a &s;overeign there: and by the care and diligence of this Prote&s;tant doctor of Nuremberg, Lutherani&s;m became e&s;tabli&s;hed, and peace and good order were pre&s;erved in the province.</P>
<P>A. D. 1550, a very &s;evere placart was publi&s;hed at Bru&s;&s;els again&s;t here&s;y, which gave unque&s;tionable proof of a de&s;ign to &s;et on foot the tribunal of the in|qui&s;ition.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of</HI> THEODORE BEZA.</HEAD>
<P>Theodore Beza, mini&s;ter of Geneva, and one of the chief pillars of the reformed church, was born the 24th of June 1519, at Vezelay, a city of Burgundy, in
<PB N="154" REF="165">France. He went to Orleans to &s;tudy under Melchior Wolmar, a German, and profe&s;&s;or of the Greek tongue, with whom he re&s;ided &s;even years, and by whom he was in&s;tructed in the Prote&s;tant religion. Beza went frequently to Geneva to vi&s;it Calvin, and &s;hewed him &s;ome of his poetical productions. Calvin was delighted with his poetry, but exhorted him to dedicate his ta|lents to the &s;ervice of the church, which he in &s;ome mea&s;ure complied with. He wrote a tract on the equality of the pa&s;tors; he tran&s;lated many of the p&s;alms of David; he likewi&s;e wrote a Latin tran&s;la|tion of the New Te&s;tament, being made profe&s;&s;or of Greek at Lau&s;anne, where he taught cla&s;&s;ics for ten years. Beza then returned to Geneva, where he &s;uc|ceeded Calvin in 1564, and wrote an apology for his Latin tran&s;lation of the New Te&s;tament, and publi&s;hed the treati&s;e of the &s;acrament, and &s;ome &s;ermons on the pa&s;&s;ions of Chri&s;t The religious war breaking out in France, Beza returned to that kingdom in 1571, to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the national &s;ynod of Rochelle, of which he was elected moderator: for the peace was broke through, by the ma&s;&s;acre at Paris the &s;ame year, which was called the ma&s;&s;acre of St Bartholomew, in which above thirty thou&s;and Prote&s;tants were murdered; and the King of Navarre, with the Prince of Conde, the only two per&s;ons &s;aved, were compelled to abjure the reformed religion. This horrid bu&s;ine&s;s, commonly called the wedding of Paris, has been &s;candalou&s;ly repre&s;ented, by Gabriel Nawde, as a ma&s;ter-piece in policy. But all the Europeans looked upon this action with the utmo&s;t abhorrence, &s;aying, that, in the ac|counts of the mo&s;t barbarous nations, there was never an example of &s;uch horrid cruelty. The Huguenots, recommenced the war with great animo&s;ity; and Beza, in 1572, a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the &s;ynod of Ni&s;mes, where he oppo&s;ed the faction of John Morel, who de&s;igned to introduce a new di&s;cipline. The royal army be&s;ieged Ro|chelle, which was &s;o gallantly defended by the Prote&s;|tants,
<PB N="155" REF="166">that peace was granted them in 1573. The fifth civil war began the next year, when Charles IX. died, and was &s;ucceeded by his brother Henry III. The Prince of Conde at that time &s;ent for Beza to Stra&s;burg, that he might carry on a negociation with Prince John Ca&s;imir, admini&s;trator of the Palatinate; which &s;hews it was well known, that Beza under&s;tood other things be&s;ides lectures and books. He &s;uc|ceeded &s;o well, that Ca&s;imir brought an army from Germany to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Huguenots, who obtained a peace upon more advantageous terms than any of the former. Beza returned to Geneva, where James Ar|minius was &s;ent in 1582, to perfect his &s;tudies, at the expence of the magi&s;trates of Am&s;terdam, and chiefly followed the lectures of Beza, who at that time ex|pounded the epi&s;tle to the Romans. Arminius was afterwards profe&s;&s;or of divinity at Leyden, and formed a &s;eparate &s;ect, which was condemned in a national &s;ynod; for he oppo&s;ed Beza, as a Supralap&s;arian, and acknowledged no other election, but that which was grounded on the obedience of &s;inners, to the call of God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Beza however per&s;i&s;ted in the doctrines of Calvin, and was a very great in&s;trument in conducting the re|formation, according to the tenets he had e&s;pou&s;ed; but his piece in defence of per&s;ecution was a blemi&s;h to his character. He died on the 13th of October 1605, aged 86<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Hi&s;t. of the Synod of Dort.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Per&s;ecution continued neverthele&s;s greatly to prevail through all the Low Countries, for more than twenty-years: but even at Utrecht, where much per&s;ecution had been practi&s;ed, the reformation made a con&s;ider|ble progre&s;s about the year 1566; and the Prote&s;|tants in Flanders began to hold their meetings more openly in &s;everal provinces, and their mini&s;ters &s;ettled in &s;ome of the principal towns and cities. The Prince of Orange, as governor of Antwerp, makes an agree|ment
<PB N="156" REF="167">with the Prote&s;tants of that city, with re&s;pect to the public exerci&s;e of religion. They build churches there for that purpo&s;e: the mini&s;ters take an oath of fidelity to their government: but there aro&s;e a diffe|rence between the Lutherans and Calvini&s;ts concern|ing the &s;acrament; and they were tolerated in receiv|ing the Lord's &s;upper, according to the different ap|prehen&s;ions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Blandt's Hi&s;t. of the Reformation, vol. i. p. 266.

The &s;entence of the Spani&s;h inqui&s;itors was publi&s;hed again&s;t the Netherlands, and the decree of the council of Trent impo&s;ed on the clergy of Utrecht.</P>
<P>About this time, abundance of books and pamphlets were publi&s;hed again&s;t the Spani&s;h cruelty and viola|tion of con&s;cience, and were di&s;per&s;ed all over the nation, to which Alva oppo&s;ed a &s;evere placart.</P>
<P>The Prince of Orange declares war, publi&s;hes a manife&s;to, dated Augu&s;t 31, 1568, but was not a match for Alva's numerous army, and was obliged to retire to Germany, and there di&s;banded this forces.</P>

<P>Soon after this there followed a dreadful per&s;ecution at Valienciennes.</P>
<P>On the 4th of May this year, the town of Ter Veer, in Zealand, declared for the Prince of Orange again&s;t Alva; and &s;everal other cities followed their example, and the Prince promoted a general toleration, at lea&s;t gave protection to the Romani&s;ts in the exerci&s;e of their religion, as well as liberty of con&s;cience to tho&s;e of other per&s;ua&s;ions<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Brandt's Hi&s;t. of the Reformation, p. 296.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>A. D. 1573.] In proce&s;s of time the reformed reli|gion, according to the practice of the church of Geneva, was introduced among the Hollanders, who gave the greate&s;t liberty of con&s;cience, being of opinion, not only that religion ought to be tolerated, but that all re&s;traints in matters of religion was as dete&s;table as the inqui&s;ition it&s;elf: and accordingly they maintained that nobody erred wilfully, or could believe again&s;t his con&s;cience; that none but God could in&s;pire right notions into the minds of men; that no religion was agree|able to God, but what proceeded from a willing heart. Experience had al&s;o taught them, that heterodox opinions could not &s;o effectually be rooted out by hu|man power or violence, as by length of time.

<P>January 1, 1577, the town of Muyden declared for the Prince of Orange, but upon this expre&s;s condition, that they &s;hould from thenceforward enjoy the free exerci&s;e of the Romi&s;h religion, but without di&s;turbing or offering violence to the con&s;cience of others.

<P>But the Prince granted protection to the Anabapti&s;ts of Middleburg, ina&s;much as, without taking the oaths, they for many years &s;upported all civil burthens, con|tributions, and raxes, equally with other citizens and inhabitants of the &s;aid place, and were never wanting

<P>Difference of &s;entiment on &s;ome points created no &s;mall di&s;putes among&s;t them&s;elves.

<P>The reformed religion was fir&s;t introduced at Am|&s;terdam, and a religious peace was very much pro|moted by the repre&s;entations of the Prince of Orange, and many others of Catholic charitable di&s;po&s;itions; and when the union of Utrecht was made public, a further order was given relative to religion, in which the religious peace is again publi&s;hed, with &s;uch ex|planation as tended to recommend and inforce it.</P>
<P>The reformed of Luther's party had a book of con|cord; but this was very much objected to by &s;ome other prote&s;tants, who thought it too great a re&s;traint of Chri&s;tian liberty: but this di&s;pute the Prince of Orange in great mea&s;ure conciliated.</P>
<P>In 1580, the King of Spain, at the in&s;tance of the Bi&s;hop of Ruremond, founded two univer&s;ities, viz. at Louvain and Douay, for educating pa&s;tors and teachers for the propagation of the Romi&s;h religion, and to oppo&s;e the Prote&s;tants.</P>

<PB N="161" REF="172">again&s;t which the Prince prepared an apology, and laid it before the States General, by whom it was ap|proved, and afterwards printed. The purport of which was, that the protection or indulgence of Papi&s;ts was as great in the Low Countries as was con&s;i&s;tent with the peace and the happine&s;s of the &s;ubjects in ge|neral, or with what was right and fit upon the whole; and in proce&s;s of time, this proved a means of the pro|hibition of the Popi&s;h religion in Holland and Harlem: but as &s;ome of them petitioned, and &s;ome of the ma|gi&s;trates of Harlem favoured a general liberty, they were again indulged.</P>
<P>A.

<P>A.

<P>The &s;ame year the &s;tates of Utrecht cho&s;e Prince Maurice their Stadtholder; upon condition, that his ex|cellency &s;hould maintain and defend the true Chri&s;tian and Evangelical religion: and was afterwards elected in other provinces on the &s;ame condition.</P>
<P>There was likewi&s;e a &s;ynod of South Hollanders held at Dort: in this &s;ynod it was particularly agreed to exerci&s;e great moderation with re&s;pect to the point
<PB N="163" REF="174">of prede&s;tination; and this terminated in a greater mo|deration, even with re&s;pect to Papi&s;ts them&s;elves, in|&s;omuch that they obtained a church at Breda.</P>
<P>In 1592, the States of Holland being &s;en&s;ible of the want of learned men to guard again&s;t the encroach|ments or prevalence of Romi&s;h error, in&s;tituted a &s;e|minary or nur&s;ery of &s;tudents at Leyden, who were to be in&s;tructed and educated in the &s;cience of divinity, at the charge of the government.</P>
<P>The &s;ame year, Guellius Snecanus, mini&s;ter in Frie&s;|land, publi&s;hed a book, in which he treated of prede&s;tina|tion agreeable to the opinion of Melancthon, maintain|ing that the doctrine of a conditional prede&s;tination was con&s;i&s;tent with the word of God. This was afterwards oppo&s;ed by Beza, and by many others, with great warmth. However, per&s;ecution gave it the greate&s;t check, and many hazarded their lives for denying pre|de&s;tination according to Calvin, and adhering rather to the moderate expo&s;ition and &s;entiments of Bullinger.</P>
<P>In 1595, the Romani&s;ts had now got to too great a height, both of power and influence, in&s;omuch that it was found nece&s;&s;ary by the States of Holland to pub|li&s;h a placart again&s;t them.</P>
<P>The States took a more wife and effectual method for promoting a reformation at this time, by a new tran&s;lation of the holy &s;criptures, under the care of Heer Van Aldegende, who had &s;hewn wherein the tran&s;lation by Luther was indeed erroneous and fal&s;e.</P>
<P>About the year 1598, there were wa&s;ted over from England a new &s;et of people, called Browni&s;ts, who were for reforming the reformation.

<P>Thus ended this century, at which time the churches of the Provinces &s;till found them&s;elves very far from the end they had propo&s;ed in ca&s;ting off the yoke of the Romi&s;h papacy; for we were not only obliged to &s;trug|gle with the remaining Papi&s;ts, who were careful to try all artifices to pre&s;erve their old adherents, and to allure to them&s;elves new followers, but we were like|wi&s;e involved in mutual di&s;putes with different &s;ects, each of which taking contrary paths, and making no advances towards harmony, nor uniting with each other. They fore&s;aw the con&s;equences, and endeavoured to ac|commodate matters as well as they could; but little, very little, was done this way by collective bodies. A

<P>The &s;ixteenth century began with &s;ome in&s;tances of the great moment the &s;tates of the United Provinces thought liberty in religion, whil&s;t they endeavoured by their interpo&s;ition and recommendation to divert the magi&s;trates of Cologne from per&s;ecuting the reformed, and to prevent, by their influence, the per&s;ecuting the Anabapti&s;ts at Fri&s;ian, to which the clergy had excited the magi&s;tracy. A &s;ynod was called at Harlem, to treat of what things might tend to a more general peace; but there were found &s;ome of turbulent di&s;po|&s;itions; and whil&s;t the bu&s;ine&s;s of tran&s;lating the Bible was promoted by the Meer Van Aldegende, Arminius, and Vitenbogart, Beza's defence of per&s;ecution was tran&s;lated and recommended by the Fri&s;ian divines<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the Acts of the North Holland &s;ynod at Am&s;terdam, 1601.</NOTE>, and the &s;pirit and practice of per&s;ecution, more e&s;peci|ally again&s;t the Anabapti&s;ts, prevailed for &s;ome years.</P>
<P>In the year 1601 was that remarkable piece publi&s;h|ed by Junius, profe&s;&s;or of divinity at Leyden, called the <HI>Irenicon, or peaceable Chri&s;tian,</HI> pre&s;ented to the States, and highly commended by them.</P>
<P>In 1602, Arminius was called to the profe&s;&s;or&s;hip at Leyden, tho' not without great oppo&s;ition, on ac|count of his oppo&s;ing &s;trenuou&s;ly the doctrines of Cal|vin and Beza, on the &s;ubject of prede&s;tination. Warm di&s;putes now commenced between divers opponents on this point: fir&s;t, or principally, between Arminius and Gomarus, in which the mo&s;t celebrated fathers and
<PB N="166" REF="177">principal reformers are introduced, as differing on tho&s;e controverted points. At length, a &s;ynod was held at Delft, in South Holland, and the arguments &s;ubmitted to them. This controver&s;y &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for &s;even years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, without any apparent advan|tage, which occa&s;ioned &s;everal per&s;ons of con&s;iderable note to interpo&s;e by their advice, to put a &s;top, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to any farther di&s;putes on the &s;ubject of prede&s;tination<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brandt's Hi&s;tory of the Reformation, vol. ii. p. 43.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In 1603 a &s;ynod was held, in which the Prote&s;tants made a decree, for declaring the Pope of Rome An|tichri&s;t; becau&s;e he a&s;&s;umed an ab&s;olute, and, they &s;aid, an oppre&s;&s;ive pre-eminence and authority above all other churches and pa&s;tors, and called him&s;elf GOD.</P>
<P>Among other noble and learned per&s;onages, who u&s;ed their endeavours for the prevention of di&s;putes and re&s;toring peace, was Philip Du Moulin, who, in a letter to Daniel Silenus, profe&s;&s;or of divinity at Sedan, thus expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf: Would to God that all of us did but contain our&s;elves within the bounds of &s;cripture, and not proceed any farther, to the end we might join our common &s;trength again&s;t the Romi&s;h idolatry, &s;uper&s;tition and tyranny; and, as to the re&s;t, bear with each other, learn to treat men's doctrines with mode|ration, and their per&s;ons with caution, provided that they on their part do act with piety.</P>
<P>The Lord of Ple&s;&s;is to the Heer Vander Myle thus writes: In general I maintain and advi&s;e, that where the fundamentals of &s;alvation are not &s;truck at, nor the outward wor&s;hip defiled with idolatry or &s;uper&s;tition, there is no cau&s;e of &s;eparation, even tho' people differ in points of &s;ome importance.</P>
<P>A. D. 1608.] Several Princes this year laboured to compo&s;e the differences of the reformed and Lutherans; but Arminius and Vitenbogart finding that the much<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bo&s;&s;uet, book xiii. vol. ii. p. 364.</NOTE>
<PB N="167" REF="178">&s;tronger party e&s;pou&s;ed the doctrine of prede&s;tination, and they were more and more reproached for their different &s;entiments, found it nece&s;&s;ary to wave the matter in di&s;pute as far as con&s;i&s;ted with a regard to truth and the &s;upport of their characters, &s;eeking no public di&s;putes, but &s;ubmitting to &s;uch as the States for their greater &s;atisfaction &s;hould call them to.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, the reformed met with great difficul|ties in provinces where Popery gained the a&s;cendant, they were prohibited preaching. The States of Hol|land publi&s;hed a decree in 1610, forbidding any per&s;on to write or publi&s;h any thing about the power of go|vernors in church-matters, as al&s;o about prede&s;tina|tion, and the points relating thereto.</P>
<P>However, this did not prove &s;ufficient to &s;uppre&s;s di&s;putes on the&s;e &s;ubjects; and for near &s;even years the love of &s;trife and confu&s;ion &s;eemed to have diffu&s;ed it|&s;elf throughout the whole land. The remon&s;trants and contra-remon&s;trants, on every occa&s;ion, or at every opportunity, warmly conte&s;ting the points in di&s;pute, repre&s;entations was made of it in England; and it was in proce&s;s of time judged nece&s;&s;ary to convene a gene|ral council or &s;ynod, which was held at Dort, and commenced the 13th of November 1618.</P>
<P>A. D. 1616.] In the mean time there were not want|ing other &s;ubjects, which almo&s;t nece&s;&s;arily employed the pens of many learned and judicious per&s;ons; &s;ome in defence of liberty again&s;t the undue power a&s;&s;umed and exerci&s;ed by the magi&s;tracy of the States of Hol|land, who were for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing all writings and debates what&s;oever, that called in que&s;tion any part of their creed, and this too in the mo&s;t arbitrary manner.</P>
<P>A. D. 1617.] In this interval the di&s;pute aro&s;e, or rather revived, relative to the equality of the Son with the Father; which we &s;hall no farther enter upon, than as an in&s;tance of the authority a&s;&s;umed by the States, in oppo&s;ition even to that di&s;tingui&s;hing tenet of Pro|te&s;tants,
<PB N="168" REF="179">that the &s;criptures are a &s;ufficient rule of faith and practice.</P>
<P>For in the remon&s;trance of Venator, pre&s;ented to the States of Holland, he made this open profe&s;&s;ion: "I declare that the holy &s;cripture does fully contain in it&s;elf all that is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, without the ad|dition of human phra&s;es, or un&s;criptural expre&s;&s;ions; and that it is &s;ufficient for a &s;incere Chri&s;tian, in mat|ters of faith, e&s;pecially in the mo&s;t ab&s;tru&s;e or nice points, to explain his mind in the very words of the Bible; and, con&s;equently, that no man ought to be cen&s;ured as a heretic, who at the very fir&s;t &s;ays all that the &s;criptures it&s;elf &s;ays of any thing, and afterwards &s;ays no more, nor in any other manner, nor wre&s;ts it to any other &s;en&s;e or purpo&s;e; and when I &s;ay in &s;crip|ture phra&s;e, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is our Lord and Saviour, the only mediator between God and man, our prophet, high prie&s;t, and King, whom God hath &s;et forth to be a propitiation for &s;in, who is one with the Father, the brightne&s;s of his glory, and expre&s;s image of his per&s;on; this ought to &s;uffice." But notwith&s;tandng this book was ordered to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and he bani&s;hed the juri&s;diction of Delft.</P>
<P>The &s;ynod of Dort therefore convened on the 13th of November 1618, after much ceremony in fixing the credentials of the con&s;tituent members, ob&s;erving a general fa&s;t, electing a pre&s;ident, &amp;c. The Eng|li&s;h tran&s;lation of the Bible came under their con&s;idera|tion and regulation; the exclu&s;ion of the apocryphal books; whether, in addre&s;&s;ing God by prayer, the term <HI>thou</HI> or <HI>you</HI> was fitte&s;t to be made u&s;e of; debates a|ro&s;e about the word Jehovah, whether it &s;hould be rendered Lord in the new tran&s;lation; whether the Hebrew proper names &s;hould be retained, or that they &s;hould tran&s;late them; mention was likewi&s;e made of a new divi&s;ion of chapters and ver&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brandt's Hi&s;tory of the Reformation, vol. iii. book xxxiii. p. 18 to 28.</NOTE>. They proceeded
<PB N="169" REF="180">next to the choice of &s;upervi&s;ors of this new tran&s;lation: but there aro&s;e a great difficulty in naming them; for the deputies of the province of Utrecht were equally divided, three remon&s;trants and three contra-remon|&s;trants: at length different &s;upervi&s;ors were appointed for the Old and the New Te&s;taments. The&s;e were the tran&s;actions of the fir&s;t thirteen &s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>A. D. 1618] At the 14th &s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ynod of Dort, the Heidelberg catechi&s;m, which had been re|ceived in the&s;e provinces, was appointed to be read and expounded in the afternoon &s;ervice; and, at the opening the 25th &s;e&s;&s;ion, the pre&s;ident made a very learned di&s;cour&s;e, about the nece&s;&s;ity of catechi&s;ing, both for children and adults; urging, that it was the foun|dation of religion, and the only way to in&s;til the prin|ciples of Chri&s;tianity: an ancient practice among the patriarchs, the apo&s;tles, u&s;ed by Origen, approved and recommended by the fathers; the neglect of which had occa&s;ioned the ignorance of the vulgar, as well as the many &s;ects of Papi&s;ts, Anabapti&s;ts, and other &s;ec|taries; and that it was now more nece&s;&s;ary, from the indu&s;try of the Je&s;uits to propagate and e&s;tabli&s;h the doctrines of the Romi&s;h church by the &s;ame method. The manner of doing it, according to the different ages, capacities, and improvements of different per|&s;ons, and agreeable to the &s;entiments of the divines that con&s;tituted this &s;ynod, was the bu&s;ine&s;s of the a&s;|&s;embly the remaining part of this &s;e&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brandt's Hi&s;tory of the Reformation, vol. iii. b. xxxiii. p. 29.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It would be almo&s;t endle&s;s to enumerate all the tran&s;|actions of this remarkable &s;ynod for 180 &s;e&s;&s;ions; &s;ome of which appear as remarkably trifling as others are &s;uitable and important. The 10th and $7th &s;e&s;&s;ion were employed in new modelling the catechi&s;m; 18th and 19th, the bapti&s;m of the children of unbelievers de|bated; 20th, whether &s;tudents for the mini&s;try &s;hould not be bapti&s;ed before they were admitted; 20th to
<PB N="170" REF="181">24th, taken up in &s;ettling &s;ome punctilios, about right and precedence of &s;ome of the deputed members. &amp;c. 24th, the doctrine of prede&s;tination revived. Several &s;ucceeding &s;e&s;&s;ions the remon&s;trants attempted their vindication with re&s;pect to the five principal points in di&s;pute of prede&s;tination; the extent of the merits of Chri&s;t's death, conver&s;ion, &s;aving faith, final per&s;eve|rance, grace of God, and wherein their zeal had been cen&s;ured by the &s;ynod; and from the 30th to the 129th &s;e&s;&s;ion, were &s;pent in debates, pro and con. between the remon&s;trants, and contra-remon&s;trants, when the &s;ynod declared they had then agreed as to the funda|mentals of religion, as appears from the conformity of our judgments, tho' it is hardly to be expected we &s;hould entirely agree in the manner of expre&s;&s;ing things, and in that the canons were read. According to their de|termination on the five fore-mentioned points, many &s;ub&s;cribed of the foreign members, but others there were who refu&s;ed it. Rea&s;ons are offered, petitions are pre&s;ented, and a wide field is opened to furni&s;h matter for a much longer continuance of the &s;ynod: neverthele&s;s in proce&s;s of time, after &s;everal other &s;e&s;&s;ions, the articles of faith agreed to by the &s;ynod were read, and therein they condemn the doctrine of the remon|&s;trants, and pa&s;&s;ed a decree of cen&s;ure on their per&s;ons, excluding them from the mini&s;try, and from writing in favour of the doctrines they had e&s;pou&s;ed and pro|pagated, which were not approved by the &s;ynod, and that none of them &s;hould be allowed to enjoy any place of profit, or to officiate in any of the public &s;eminaries of learning. But this prohibition was only complied with in part, many regarding their call to the mini&s;try as indi&s;pen&s;ible, and of con&s;equence to promote the truth in &s;pite of any oppo&s;ition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brandt, vol. iii. book xli. p. 309.</NOTE>. This may &s;uffice for an account of the &s;ynod of Dort; but it will not be un&s;uitable to add the judgment of Dr. Heylin, one of
<PB N="171" REF="182">the chaplains of King Charles I. concerning this &s;ynod.</P>
<P>This &s;ynod, &s;ays he, was much like that of Trent in the motives to it, as al&s;o in the managing and con|duct of it; for as neither was a&s;&s;embled, till the &s;word was drawn, the terror thereof was able to effect more than all other arguments, &s;o that neither was &s;o much concerned to confute, as condemn their op|po&s;ites. The council of Trent con&s;i&s;ted for the mo&s;t part of Italian Bi&s;hops; &s;ome others added for form &s;ake, that it might the better challenge the name of general. That of Dort con&s;i&s;ted, for the mo&s;t part, of the delegates of the Belgic churches, to whom the foreign divines were found incon&s;iderable; the diffe|rences were as great at Dort, as they were at Trent; and as much care was taken to &s;oothe the contending parties. The Briti&s;h divines, with &s;ome of tho&s;e from Bremen, maintained the univer&s;al redemption of man|kind by the death of Chri&s;t; but this by no means could be granted by the re&s;t of the &s;ynod, e&s;pecially by tho&s;e of North Holland, for fear of yielding any thing to the Arminians; as Soto in the council of Trent oppo&s;ed &s;ome moderate opinions, teaching the certainty of &s;alvation, becau&s;e they were too much in favour of Lutherani&s;m. In both, the weake&s;t party was not admitted to a fair hearing; and in the latter, the name of an Arminian carried a condemnation in it&s;elf without any conviction.</P>
<P>A. D. 1620] Though it may be very ju&s;tly main|tioned as no &s;mall commendation of the &s;ynod of Dort, that they fir&s;t declared in what high e&s;teem they held the Chri&s;tian religion, &s;ubjoining as their opinion, that the &s;aid religion con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in practice, or in the ob&s;ervation of God's commands; and that they were the touch&s;tone, by which all doctrinal points, and all controver&s;ies of religion, could be tried with the greate&s;t certainty and advantage; that whatever tended in its own nature to enervate, or to invalidate
<PB N="172" REF="183">tho&s;e commands, ought con&s;equently to be looked upon as fal&s;e. Whereas all other matters which were not contrary to them, might in their opinion be main|tained on either &s;ide, provided it were done with charity and prudence, and that they wi&s;hed for no|thing more &s;incerely, than to &s;ee chri&s;tianity free from the intricacies and &s;ubtilties which had too long ob|&s;cured its original excellency<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brandt's Hi&s;tory of the Reformation, vol. iv. p. 108.</NOTE>. But, notwith&s;tanding this, we find by the preceding cen&s;ure, and &s;everal &s;evere placarts that followed, that a far different &s;pirit prevailed among&s;t them. Witne&s;s a &s;evere placart publi&s;hed this &s;ame year again&s;t the remon&s;trants, and their cruel proceedings again&s;t de Prins, and Gre|vius, two remon&s;trant mini&s;ters, which indeed proved too heavy for them to &s;upport under it</P>
<P>This has led many impartial hi&s;torians to cen&s;ure the general prevalency of per&s;ecuting principles among Prote&s;tants, of which there are too many evident proofs in their writings and conduct.</P>
<P>Dr. Chandler has remarked the conduct of Mr. Calvin, in the following manner:</P>
<P>John Calvin, to whom the Chri&s;tian world is, on many accounts, under very great obligations, was however well known to be in principle and practice a per&s;ecutor. So entirely was he in the per&s;ecuting mea&s;ures, that he wrote a treati&s;e in defence of them, maintaining the lawfulne&s;s of putting heretics to death: and that by heretics, he meant &s;uch who differed from him&s;elf, is evident from his treatment of Ca&s;tellio and Servetus.</P>
<P>The former, not inferior to Calvin him&s;elf in learn|ing and piety, had the misfortune to differ from him in judgment, in the points of prede&s;tination, election, free-will, and faith. This Calvin could not bear, and therefore treated Ca&s;tellio in &s;o rude and cruel a man|ner, that his warme&s;t friends, I believe, will be a&s;hamed
<PB N="173" REF="184">to ju&s;tify. In &s;ome of his writings, he calls him <HI>bla&s;|phemer, reviler, malicious barking dog, full of ignorance, be&s;tiality and impudence, impo&s;tor, a ba&s;e corrupter of the &s;acred writings, a mocker of God, a contemner of all religion, an impudent fellow, a filthy dog, a knave, an impious, lewd, crooked-minded vagabond, beggarly rogue.</HI> At other times, he calls him <HI>a di&s;ciple and brother of</HI> Servetus, <HI>and an heretic.</HI> Ca&s;tellio's reply, to all the&s;e flowers, is worthy the patience and moderation of a Chri&s;tian, and from his &s;landers he appeals to the righteous judgment of God. But Calvin, not content with his former invectives, further accu&s;ed him of three crimes, which Ca&s;tellio particularly an&s;wers. The fir&s;t was of theft, in taking away &s;ome wood, that belonged to another per&s;on, to make a fire to warm him&s;elf. This Calvin calls <HI>cur&s;ed gain, at another's expence and damage;</HI> whereas, in truth, the fact was this:&mdash;Ca&s;tellio was thrown into &s;uch circum&s;tances of po|verty by the per&s;ecutions of Calvin and his friends, that he was &s;carce able to maintain him&s;elf; and as he dwelt near the banks of the Rhine, he u&s;ed, at lei&s;ure hours, to draw out of the river, with an hook, the wood that was brought down by the waters. This wood was no private property, but every man's that could catch it. Ca&s;tellio took it in the middle of the day, among&s;t a great number of fi&s;hermen, and &s;e|veral of his own acquaintance; and was &s;ometimes paid money for it by the decree of the &s;enate. This Calvin magnified into a theft, and publi&s;hed to the world, to point out the character of his Chri&s;tian brother.</P>
<P>But his accu&s;ations ran farther yet; and he calls God to witne&s;s, that whil&s;t he maintained Ca&s;tellio in his hou&s;e, he never &s;aw any one more proud, or per|fidious, or void of humanity; and that it was well known, he was an impo&s;tor of peculiar impudence, and one that took plea&s;ure in &s;coffing at piety, and that he d$$ gated him&s;elf in laughing at the principles of religion. $span$ an&s;wered in &s;uch
<PB N="174" REF="185">a manner, as was &s;ufficient to &s;ilence malice it&s;elf; and Calvin, with two of his principal friends, eminent preachers in Savoy, pre&s;&s;ed Ca&s;tellio to take the charge of a &s;chool in Stra&s;burg. Ca&s;tellio, on that occa&s;ion, a&s;ked Calvin, with what con&s;cience could you make me ma&s;ter, if you knew me to be &s;uch a per&s;on, when I dwelt in your hou&s;e? What &s;ort of men mu&s;t they be, who would commit the education of children to &s;uch a wicked wretch as you appeal to God you knew me to be? However, Ca&s;tellio accepted of the &s;chool, and having been ma&s;ter thereof three years, was deemed fit for the pa&s;toral office; Calvin him|&s;elf giving him &s;uch a te&s;timonial, as fal&s;ified all he had &s;aid again&s;t him.</P>
<P>To this may be added the treatment of Jerom Bol|&s;ec, a Carmelite monk, who embraced the reformed religion, but differed from Calvin in the articles of free-will and prede&s;tination: and therefore by his means bani&s;hed from Geneva, under the penalty of being whipped in ca&s;e of his return.</P>
<P>Before the mini&s;ters of the reformed party were en|gaged in the controver&s;y with Arminius, their zeal was continually exerting it&s;elf again&s;t the Anabapti&s;ts, whom they declared to be excommunicated and cut off from the church, and endeavoured to convert by violence and force, prohibiting them from preaching under fines, and bani&s;hing them their country, upon account of their opinions. And the better to colour the&s;e proceedings, &s;ome of them wrote in defence of per&s;ecution; or which is the &s;ame thing, again&s;t the toleration of any religion or opinions different from their own; and for the better &s;upport of orthodoxy, they would have had the &s;ynods ordain, that all church-officers &s;hould renew their &s;ub&s;criptions to the confe&s;|&s;ion and catechi&s;m every year, that hereby they might the better know who had changed their &s;entiments, and differed from the received faith. The practice was perfectly agreeable to the Geneva di&s;cipline;
<PB N="175" REF="186">Calvin him&s;elf, as hath been &s;hewn, being in judg|ment for per&s;ecuting hereticks; and Beza having wrote a treati&s;e, A. D. 1600, to prove the lawfulne&s;s of puni&s;hing them. This book was tran&s;lated from the Latin, into the Low Dutch language, by Boger|man, afterwards pre&s;ident of the &s;ynod of Dort, and publi&s;hed with a dedication, and recommendation of it to the magi&s;trates. The con&s;equence of this was, that very &s;evere placarts were publi&s;hed again&s;t the Anabapti&s;ts in Frie&s;land and Groningen, where|by they were forbidden to preach; and all per&s;ons prohibited from letting their hou&s;es and grounds to them, under the penalty of a large fine, or confine|ment to bread and water for fourteen days. If they offended the third time, they were to be bani&s;hed the city, and the juri&s;diction thereof. Who&s;oever was di&s;covered to rebapti&s;e any per&s;on &s;hall forfeit twenty dollars; and upon a &s;econd conviction be put to bread and water, and then be bani&s;hed. Unbapti&s;ed chil|dren were made incapable of inheriting; and if any married out of the reformed church, he was declared incapable of inheriting any e&s;tate, and the children made illegitimate.</P>
<P>But the controver&s;y that made the greate&s;t noi&s;e, and produced the mo&s;t remarkable effects, was that carried on between the Calvini&s;ts and Arminians. Ja|cobus Arminius, one of the profe&s;&s;ors of divinity at Leyden, di&s;puting in his turn about the doctrine of prede&s;tination, advanced &s;everal things differing from the opinions of Calvin on this article, and was in a few months after warmly oppo&s;ed by Gomarus his collegue, who held, "that it was appointed by an eternal decree of God, who among&s;t mankind &s;hall be &s;aved, and who &s;hall be damned." This was indeed the &s;entiment of mo&s;t of the clergy of the United Provinces, who therefore endeavoured to run down Arminius and his doctrine with the greate&s;t zeal, in their private conver&s;ations, public di&s;putes, and in
<PB N="176" REF="187">their very &s;ermons to their congregations, charging him with innovations, and of being a follower of the antient heretical monk Pelagius; whereas the govern|ment was more inclinable to Arminius's &s;cheme, as being le&s;s intelligible by the people, and endeavoured all they could to prevent the&s;e differences of the clergy from breaking out into an open quarrel, to the di&s;|turbance of the public peace. But the mini&s;ters of the prede&s;tinarian party would enter into no treaty for peace: the remon&s;trants were the objects of their fu|rious zeal, whom they called Mamalukes, Devils, and Plagues, animating the magi&s;trates to extirpate and de&s;troy them, and crying out from the pulpits, "We mu&s;t go through thick and thin, without fearing to &s;tick in the mire: we know what Elijah did to Baal's prie&s;ts." And when the time drew near for the elec|tion of new magi&s;trates, they prayed to God for &s;uch men, "as would be zealous even to blood, though it were to co&s;t the whole trade of their cities." They al&s;o accu&s;ed them of keeping up a corre&s;pondence with the Je&s;uits and Spaniards, and of a de&s;ign to betray their country to them.</P>
<P>The&s;e proceedings gave great di&s;turbance to the magi&s;trates, e&s;pecially as many of the clergy took great liberties with them, furiou&s;ly inveighing again&s;t them in their &s;ermons as enemies to the church, and per&s;e|cutors; as libertines and free-thinkers, who hated the &s;incere mini&s;ters of God, and endeavoured to turn them out of their office. This conduct, together with their ob&s;tinate refu&s;al of all mea&s;ures of accommoda|tion, and peace with the remon&s;trants, &s;o incen&s;ed the magi&s;trates, that in &s;everal cities they &s;u&s;pended &s;ome of the warme&s;t and mo&s;t &s;editious of them, and pro|hibited them from the public exerci&s;es of their mini&s;|terial function; particularly Gezelius of Roterdam, and afterwards Ro&s;aeus, mini&s;ter at the Hague, for endeavouring to make a &s;chi&s;m in the church, and ex|horting the people to break off communion with their
<PB N="177" REF="188">brethren. Being thus di&s;carded, they a&s;&s;umed to them&s;elves the name of the per&s;ecuted church, and met together in private hou&s;es, ab&s;olutely refu&s;ing all communion with the remon&s;trant mini&s;ters and party, in &s;pite of all the attempts made u&s;e of to reconcile and unite them.</P>
<P>What the mini&s;ters of the contra-remon&s;trant party aimed at, was the holding a national council, which at length, after a long oppo&s;ition, was agreed to in the a&s;&s;embly of the States General, who appointed Dort for the place of the meeting. Prince Maurice of Orange, the Stadtholder, effectually prepared matters for holding the &s;aid a&s;&s;embly; and as he declared him&s;elf openly for the contra-remon&s;trant party, not for that he was of their opinions in religion, being rather inclined to tho&s;e of Arminius, but becau&s;e he thought them the be&s;t friends to his family, he took care that the council &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of &s;uch per&s;ons as were well affected to them. In order to this his ex|cellency changed the government of mo&s;t of the towns of Holland, depo&s;ed tho&s;e magi&s;trates who were of the remon&s;trant per&s;ua&s;ion, or that favoured them in the bu&s;ine&s;s of toleration, and filled up their places with contra remon&s;trants, or &s;uch as promoted their intere&s;ts, making u&s;e of the troops of the States to obviate all oppo&s;ition. The con&s;equence of this was the impri&s;onment of &s;everal great men of the re|mon&s;trant per&s;ua&s;ion, &s;uch as the Advocate Olden|barnevelt, Grotius, and others; and the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, or total deprivation of a con&s;iderable number of the re|mon&s;trant clergy, &s;uch as Vitenbogart of the Hague, Grovinckhovius of Roterdam, Grevius, and others, by particular &s;ynods met together for that purpo&s;e, and to prepare things, and appoint per&s;ons for the en&s;uing national one at Dort. The per&s;ons fixed on were ge|nerally the mo&s;t violent of the contra-remon&s;trant party, and who had publickly declared, that they would not enter into communion with tho&s;e that differed from them, nor agree to any terms of moderation and

There were al&s;o &s;everal foreign divines &s;um|moned to this council, who were mo&s;t of them in the Calvini&s;tic &s;cheme, and profe&s;&s;ed enemies to the Arm$nians. The lay commi&s;&s;ioners al&s;o, who were cho&s;en by the States, were mo&s;t of them very partial contra-remon&s;trants, and two or three of them, who &s;eemed more impartial than the others, were hardly &s;uffered to &s;peak; and if they did, were pre&s;ently &s;u&s;|pected, and repre&s;ented by letters &s;ent to the States, and Prince Maurice at the Hague, as per&s;ons that fa|voured the remon&s;trants, which was then con&s;idered as a crime again&s;t the government, in&s;omuch that by the&s;e in&s;inuations they were in danger of being &s;trip|ped of all their employments<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Council of Dort, A. D. 1618.</NOTE>. The fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion and opening of this venerable a&s;&s;embly, was Nov. 13, 1618. John Bogerman was cho&s;en pre&s;ident of it; the &s;ame worthy and moderate divine, who had be|fore tran&s;lated into Low Dutch Beza's treati&s;e, to prove the lawfulne&s;s of puni&s;hing heretics, with a preface recommendatory to the civil magi&s;trate; cho&s;en, not by the whole &s;ynod, but by the Low Country divines only, the foreigners not being allowed any &s;hare in the election.</P>
<P>At the fifth &s;e&s;&s;ion the remon&s;trants petitioned the &s;ynod, that a competent number of their friends might have leave to appear before them, and that the citation might be &s;ent to the whole body, and not to any &s;ingle per&s;on, to the end that they might be at liberty to &s;end &s;uch as they &s;hould judge be&s;t qualified to de|fend their cau&s;e; and particularly in&s;i&s;ted, that Gro|vinckhovius and Goulart might be of the number. One would have thought that &s;o equitable a reque&s;t &s;hould have been readily granted. But they were told, that it could not be allowed that the remon&s;trants &s;hould pa&s;s for a di&s;tinct body, or make any deputa|tion of per&s;ons in their common name to treat of their
<PB N="179" REF="192">affairs; and agreeably to this declaration the &s;ummons that were given out, were not &s;ent to the remon&s;trants as a body or part of the &s;ynod, but to &s;uch particular per&s;ons as the &s;ynod thought fit to chu&s;e out of them; which was little le&s;s than citing them as criminals before a body of men, which chiefly con&s;i&s;ted of their profe&s;&s;ed adver&s;aries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act. Syn. Dord. Se&s;&s;. 22.</NOTE>. When they fir&s;t appeared in the &s;ynod, and Epi&s;copius, in the name of the re&s;t of them, talked of entering into a regular conference about the points in difference, they were immediately given to under&s;tand, that no conference was intended, but that their only bu&s;ine&s;s was to deliver their &s;entiments, and humbly to wait for the judgment of the council con|cerning them. Epi&s;copius, in the name of his bre|thren, declared, that they did not own the &s;ynod for their lawful judges, becau&s;e mo&s;t of that body were their avowed enemies, and fomenters and promoters of the unhappy &s;chi&s;m among&s;t them; upon which they were immediately reprimanded by the pre&s;ident, for im|peaching and arraigning their authority, and pre&s;um|ing to pre&s;cribe laws to the&s;e whom the States General had appointed for their judges. The divines of Geneva added upon this head, "That if people ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to the lawful determinations of the church, there then remained two methods to be u&s;ed again&s;t them; the one, that the civil magi&s;trate might &s;tretch out his arm of compul&s;ion; the other, that the church might exert her power, in order to &s;eparate and cut off by a public &s;entence, tho&s;e who violated the laws of God." After many debates on this head, be|tween the &s;ynod and the remon&s;trants, who adhered to their re&s;olution, of not owning the &s;ynod for their judges, they were turned out of it by Bogerman the pre&s;ident with great in&s;olence and fury; to the high di&s;&s;atisfaction of many of the foreign divines.</P>
<P>After the holy &s;ynod had thus rid them&s;elves of the remon&s;trants, who&s;e learning and good &s;en&s;e would
<PB N="180" REF="193">have rendered them exceeding trouble&s;ome to this a&s;|&s;embly, they proceeded to fix the faith; and as they had no oppo&s;ition to fear, and were almo&s;t all of one &s;ide, at lea&s;t in the main points, they agreed in their articles and canons; and in their &s;entence again&s;t the remon&s;trant clergy who had been cited to appear be|fore them; which was to this effect: "They be&s;eeched and charged, in the name of Chri&s;t, all and &s;ingular the mini&s;ters of the churches throughout the United Netherlands, &amp;c. that they for&s;ake and abandon the well known five articles of the remon&s;trants, as being fal&s;e, and no other than &s;ecret magazines of errors&mdash; And whereas &s;ome, who are gone out from among&s;t us, calling them&s;elves remon&s;trants, have out of pri|vate views and ends, unlawfully violated the di&s;cipline and government of the church &mdash; have not only trumped up old errors, but hammered out new ones too&mdash;have blackened and rendered odious the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed doctrine of the church with impudent &s;l$nders and calumnies, without end or mea&s;ure, have filled all places with &s;candal, di&s;cord, &s;cruples, troubles of con&s;cience&mdash;all which heinous offences ought to be re&s;trained and puni&s;hed in clergymen with the &s;evere&s;t cen&s;ures: therefore this national &s;ynod&mdash;being a&s;&s;ured of its own authority&mdash;doth hereby declare and deter|mine, that tho&s;e mini&s;ters, who have acted in the churches as heads of factions, and teachers of errors, are guilty, and convicted of having violated our holy religion, having made a rent in the unity of the church, and given very great &s;candal: And as for tho&s;e who were cited before this &s;ynod, that they are be&s;ides guilty of intolerable di&s;obedience &mdash; to the commands of the venerable &s;ynod: for all which rea|&s;ons the &s;ynod doth, in the fir&s;t place, di&s;charge the afore&s;aid cited per&s;ons from all eccle&s;ia&s;tical admini&s;tra|tions, and deprive them of their offices, judging them likewi&s;e unworthy of any academical employment&mdash; And as for the re&s;t of the remon&s;trant clergy, they

<P>The States readily obliged them in this Chri&s;tian and charitable reque&s;t; for as &s;oon as the &s;ynod was concluded, the old advocate Barnevelt was beheaded, who had been a zealous and hearty friend to the re|mon&s;trants and their principles; and Grotius con|demned to perpetual impri&s;onment; and becau&s;e the cited mini&s;ters would not promi&s;e wholly, and always, to ab&s;tain from the exerci&s;e of their mini&s;terial func|tions, the States pa&s;&s;ed a re&s;olution for the bani&s;hing of them, on pain, if they did not &s;ubmit to it, of being treated as di&s;turbers of the public peace. And though they only begged a re&s;pite of the &s;entence for a few days, to put their affairs in order, and to pro|vide
<PB N="182" REF="195">them&s;elves with a little money to &s;upport them|&s;elves and families in their bani&s;hment, even this was unmercifully denied them, and they were hurried away next morning by four o'clock, as though they had been enemies to the religion and liberties of their country.</P>
<P>Such was the effect of this famous Pre&s;byterian &s;y|nod, who behaved them&s;elves as tyrannically towards their brethren, as any prelatical council what&s;oever could do&punc; and to the di&s;honour of the church of Eng|land it mu&s;t be &s;aid, that they owned their &s;ynodical power, and concurred by their deputies, Carleton Bi|&s;hop of Landaff, Hall, Davenant and Ward, in con|demning the remon&s;trants, in excommunicating and depriving them, and turning them out of their churches, and in e&s;tabli&s;hing both the di&s;cipline and doctrines of Geneva, in the Netherlands. For after the council was ended, the remon&s;trants were every where driven out of their churches, and prohibited from holding any private meeting, and many of them bani&s;hed on this very account. The reader will find a very parti|cular relation of the&s;e tran&s;actions, in the learned Ge|rard Brandt's hi&s;tory of the reformation of the Low Countries, to which I mu&s;t refer him.</P>
<P>If we look into our own country we &s;hall find numerous proofs of the &s;ame antichri&s;tian &s;pirit and practice. Even our fir&s;t $$formers, who had &s;een the flames which the Papi&s;ts had kindled again&s;t their brethren, yet lighted fires them&s;elves to con&s;ume tho&s;e who dif|fered from them. Cranmer's hands were &s;tained with the blood of &s;everal. He had a &s;hare in the pro&s;e|cution and condemnation of that pious and excellent martyr John Lambert, and con&s;ented to the death of Ann A&s;kew; who were burnt for denying the corpo|ral pre&s;ence, which, though Cranmer then believed, he &s;aw afterwards rea&s;on to deny. In the year 1549, Joan Bocher was condemned for &s;ome enthu&s;ia&s;tical opinions about Chri&s;t, and delivered over to the &s;ecular
<PB N="183" REF="196">power. The &s;entence being returned to the council, King Edward VI. was moved to &s;ign a warrant for her being burnt, but could not be prevailed with to do it. Cranmer endeavoured to per&s;uade him by &s;uch arguments as rather &s;ilenced than &s;atisfied the young King. So he &s;et his hand to the warrant with tears in his eyes, &s;aying to the Archbi&s;hop, that if he did wrong, &s;ince it was in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his authority, he &s;hould an&s;wer for it to God. Though this &s;truck Cranmer with horror, yet he at la&s;t put the &s;entence in execution again&s;t her. About two years alter, one George Van Pare, a Dutchman, was accu&s;ed before them, for &s;aying, that God the Father was only God, and that Chri&s;t was not very God. And though he was a per&s;on of a very holy life, yet becau&s;e he would not abjure, he was condemned for here&s;y, and burnt in Smithfield. The Archbi&s;hop him&s;elf was afterwards burnt for here&s;y, which, as Fox ob&s;erved, many looked on as a ju&s;t retaliation from the providence of God, for the cruel &s;everities he had u&s;ed towards others.</P>
<P>In 1621, there was a warm di&s;pute between the re|mon&s;trants and contra-remon&s;trants, when Grotius en|deavoured to do the remon&s;trants &s;ome &s;ervice with his pen, by publi&s;hing a Latin treati&s;e, wherein he &s;hews what was the opinion of the primitive Chri&s;|tians, touching the five famous points of the remon|&s;trants; but he was &s;o very cautious of giving offence, that he would not di&s;clo&s;e his name; but cho&s;e rather to lie concealed, and to u&s;e arguments in favour of moderation, which might have the mo&s;t &s;alutary ten|dency.</P>
<P>In July 1621, he publi&s;hed his Latin poem, inti|tled Sylva, wherein he &s;hews his regard to the &s;acred &s;criptures, and that notwith&s;tanding his long impri&s;on|ment he had not lo&s;t his poetical talent. It is in&s;cri|bed Thuanus, junior; and as it &s;o well comports with the de&s;ign of this work, we &s;hall give an extract

<P>Indeed almo&s;t the whole of the tran&s;actions of the year 1622 are no other than &s;cenes of per&s;ecution, by fines, impri&s;onment, confi&s;cation and death it&s;elf, nay, even employing per&s;ons as &s;couts to find out cau&s;es of accu&s;ation or &s;u&s;picion, examining them by &s;undry que&s;tions, &s;ometimes of a negative nature, at other times by promi&s;es or threats, trying to extort confe&s;&s;ions of them&s;elves, or accu&s;ation of others by promi&s;es or threats; and when they had by the&s;e artful and popi&s;h methods, like tho&s;e of the inqui&s;ition, obtained the lea&s;t room whereon to ground their proceedings, we find they were dealt with as if they had been enemies to the &s;tate and good of mankind. I would not pre&s;ume to &s;ay there were no exceptions to this general per&s;ecution.

<P>The conclu&s;ion of Dr. Gerard Brandt's hi&s;tory of the reformation, which is in the year 1623, among&s;t other remarkable tran&s;actions, informs us, that, through other in&s;tances of per&s;ecution, the re|mon&s;trants were even obliged to &s;eek for &s;helter in Popi&s;h countries. Grotius and many others fled to France, and were in &s;ome mea&s;ure protected from that unchri&s;tian per&s;ecution which they &s;o &s;everely felt in their native provinces. Application was likewi&s;e made to his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, to interpo&s;e his good offices in their favour; and the remon&s;trants joined in a petition to the Prince of Orange, partly on account of the hard&s;hips they had &s;u&s;tained, and particularly with re&s;pect to a groundle&s;s and malicious charge of con&s;piracy again&s;t his &s;acred per&s;on.

<P>We may here mention what Charles Lewis, the Elector Palatine, declared with relation to the reli|gion of &s;ome Princes in Germany.

<P>INtroductory to the hi&s;tory of the Reformation in France, we &s;hall ob&s;erve, that notwith&s;tanding the gro&s;s and almo&s;t univer&s;al corruption of chri&s;tianity, by the inventions of the church of Rome, and not|with&s;tanding the nece&s;&s;ity of a reformation, from the more flagrant errors and unchri&s;tian practices of that church, their emi&s;&s;aries have always repre&s;ented the reformation as criminal in its motives; that libertini&s;m was the &s;oul, and rebellion the &s;tronge&s;t bulwark thereof; and perhaps in no nation whatever have per|&s;ecution and cruelty again&s;t Prote&s;tants been more violent than in France.</P>
<P>It is true indeed, that all tho&s;e, of what country &s;oever, who have &s;hook off the papal yoke, are indi&s;|criminately, and without exception, &s;tiled heretics, on account of their refu&s;ing to profe&s;s errors &s;hocking to rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Again, it is certain they charge the reformation with being a new doctrine, quite unknown to, or uni|ver&s;ally rejected by, the churches through all countries, preceding the ages of the reformers; though it is ea&s;y to give an hi&s;torical demon&s;tration, that, without re|gard to the points debated between us and the church of Rome (e&s;pecially tho&s;e e&s;&s;ential articles that have occa&s;ioned our &s;eparation) we teach nor practi&s;e no|thing but what was believed and practi&s;ed by the church in the mo&s;t pure ages of chri&s;tianity.

<PB N="188" REF="203">adver&s;aries of the fir&s;t promoters of the reformation are forced indeed to acknowledge, that the increa&s;e and &s;pread of it has been very extraordinary, though they do not believe or confe&s;s with us, that it has been, under God, owing to the ju&s;tne&s;s of the Prote&s;tant cau&s;e. Thus father Daniel &s;ays, that the fatal contagion had its &s;ource from men of no birth or learning, dignity and eminence in the world; and how, opinions a&s;&s;erted by ob&s;cure and illiterate people, who in maintaining them could expect nothing but oppo&s;ition and per&s;ecu|tion, yet were &s;oon after embraced by the mo&s;t learned, by Princes and Prince&s;&s;es, by the Nobility and Ple|beians, by Bi&s;hops and Abbots, who receive, as well as the meane&s;t people, and per&s;i&s;t in the &s;ame in &s;pite of all ob&s;tacles. Had the Romi&s;h mi&s;&s;ionaries met with the &s;ucce&s;s in China, in proportion to the powerful prevalence of the reformation in England or France, how would they have canonized the mi&s;&s;ionaries, and thought it as inconte&s;table a proof, that God was with them, as if they had the evidence of miracles to atte&s;t it?</P>
<P>Father Daniel acknowledges indeed, that the Lu|therans had already urged, for a long while, and laid great &s;tre&s;s on, the ignorance and corruption among the clergy; which the people were very apt to give credit to. As to the doctrines, nothing &s;eemed to be more plau&s;ible than what the innovators propo&s;ed to the Ro|mani&s;ts, viz. to take the &s;criptures for the &s;ole &s;tand|ard of the belief of the faithful. The reformers were never weary of challenging them to &s;hew, in the go&s;|pel, purgatory, the wor&s;hip of images and relics, mona&s;tic vows, the celibacy of the clergy, the &s;everal hierarchical orders, and other the like, that are well grounded on tradition, and which it is very difficult to demon&s;trate, with evidence, from the &s;cripture.</P>

<PB N="189" REF="204">that all the civil wars in France were, for &s;o many years together, to be $aid to our charge. The&s;e calumnies again&s;t our religion, &s;ays my author<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stephen Abel Laval, author of this Hi&s;tory, from whence we have principally given this ab&s;tract.</NOTE>, have moved me to write the pre&s;ent hi&s;tory of the beginnings, progre&s;s, and e&s;tabli&s;hment of the reformed religion in France, as well as of its declining and downfall, and of the entire ruin of our churches in that kingdom; which we think will fully &s;atisfy the unprejudiced reader, that the progre&s;s of the reformation in France is neither owing to the credit or power, and much le&s;s to the vi|olence of Prote&s;tants; but only to the piety, upright|ne&s;s, and purity of manners of tho&s;e who embraced Prote&s;tanti&s;m. The$ will be convinced, that the pro|gre&s;s of it was owing to the re&s;olution and heroic con|&s;tancy of our glorious martyrs for forty years together; who, with wonderful courage, have &s;tood the harde&s;t trials, and lo&s;t their lives in oppo&s;ing error and impo|&s;itions on the rights of con&s;cience. This is even by our adver&s;aries confe&s;&s;ion the glory of our reforma|tion: this is the golden age of our churches; their piety never &s;hone more bright, than when their &s;afety obliged them to &s;eek places of retirement to pay their religious wor&s;hip. How great was the fervour of their zeal, the &s;implicity and purity of their manners, the humility of their whole conduct, and their charity to|wards one another, and with all mankind?</P>
<P>But the&s;e valuable di&s;po&s;itions did not always la&s;t: many Prote&s;tants, and even whole &s;ynods, have &s;ell into more &s;ins, and conduct mo&s;t uncharitable to others; and &s;ome of the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t have degenerated from that humility and goodne&s;s, the true character of the primitive Chri&s;tians, into that covetou&s;ne&s;s and love of power, as even to anathematize, and put off from the communion of the church, their brethren, for whom Chri&s;t died; and that for the &s;ake of opinions,
<PB N="190" REF="205">wherein the mo&s;t &s;ophi&s;tical genius could never find any thing contrary to the chief de&s;ign and tendency of the Chri&s;tian religion, which was to make men truly vir|tuous in heart and life.</P>
<P>Such di&s;po&s;itions among Prote&s;tants have greatly retarded the progre&s;s of reformation; the great prin|ciple of which is, the liberty of examining all things, and of retaining what is good. Forcing con&s;ciences, inflicting penalties, to oblige people to believe, is pro|fe&s;&s;ing Popery again, and renouncing the reformation, and con&s;equently the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel. Papi&s;ts took advantage of this; and the Je&s;uits neglected no oppor|tunity of in&s;piring the minds of people with a fondne&s;s for orthodoxy, and infu&s;ing doubts with re&s;pect to the authority and validity of our &s;acred books, and have endeavoured to &s;ub&s;titute a veneration for tradition, and the opinions of the fathers, which have tended to render the minds of &s;ome per&s;ons quite indifferent as to religion; have led many others not only to renounce the reformation, but Chri&s;tianity it&s;elf, and have contributed to that va&s;t increa&s;e of Dei&s;m that have prevailed in many parts of Europe. But, amid&s;t all the confu&s;ions that have been introduced into the world thro' an intemperate zeal, and fondne&s;s for particular tenets, to the de&s;truction of liberty and virtue, and in|difference with re&s;pect to revealed religion, happy that nation, under the government of Chri&s;tian Princes, who are animated with a Chri&s;tian zeal for virtue as well as for truth; with a zeal guided by knowledge, in&s;pired by charity, void of all human con&s;iderations; who have nothing but the glory of God, and the happine&s;s of men in view; with a zeal entirely free from a ba&s;e compliance with error, and yet no le&s;s full of con|de&s;cen&s;ion and indulgence to &s;uch whom they con|ceive have fallen into them, and make no other di&s;tinc|tion in regard to their pre&s;ent condition, their natural rights and privileges, between the Jew or the Chri&s;tian, than what even di&s;cretion requires. And whil&s;t the

<HEAD><HI>Of the</HI> REFORMATION <HI>in</HI> FRANCE.</HEAD>
<P>The Reformation of France furni&s;hes us with &s;o many &s;urpri&s;ing events, that &s;ome account of its ri&s;e, progre&s;s, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ion, &s;eems to merit the attention of every &s;en&s;ible man; and will, I pre&s;ume, at this di&s;tance of time, not be unacceptable to my readers.</P>
<P>Among the many cau&s;es which concurred to pro|mote a reformation, were, the Popes u&s;urpations and tyranny, the clergy's ignorance and di&s;&s;olutene&s;s, the di&s;per&s;ion of the Walden&s;es, the re&s;toration of learning, Leo's bull of indulgences; and the di&s;putes occa&s;ioned by it may be reckoned con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>It is well known, that, &s;ince the 13th century, the church's authority was become the capital point of religion, and that by the church the Pope was meant; in him every thing centered, privileges of churches, and prerogatives of Sovereigns, were in great mea&s;ure dependent on him.</P>
<P>Pope Alexander VI. in the 15th century, under pretence of religion, declared war, and enjoined peace;
<PB N="192" REF="207">he married and divorced, he condemned and ab&s;olved, he tied and untied, ju&s;t as he plea&s;ed; and had it not been for the &s;chi&s;m that prevailed in that century, they would wholly have engaged to them&s;elves the tem|poral power as well as the &s;piritual: however, the Popes were become real Sovereigns, not only with re&s;pect to the power they had u&s;urped, but with re|&s;pect to the immen&s;e riches, which thro' numberle&s;s channels they had cau&s;ed to flow into the apo&s;tolic chamber.</P>
<P>So far were their lives from an&s;wering the charac|ter of Holine&s;s, which they claimed, that Rome and Avignon were the center of pride and luxury; and Alexander IV. before mentioned, Mezeray tells us, intruded him&s;elf into the chair by corruption and bribery, then &s;old and di&s;po&s;ed of every thing after his own will, that no Mahomedan Prince was ever &s;o imperious, vicious, and unfaithful<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mezeray, ubi &s;upra, p. 378.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Julius II. who &s;ucceeded him in 1503, di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by the per&s;ecution of Chri&s;tians. This Vicar of Chri&s;t went him&s;elf to engage in a war, kindled by him again&s;t Chri&s;tian Princes<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Guicciard. lib. ix. p. 324.</NOTE>. He for&s;ook the chair of St. Peter, to take upon him the title of Mars, god of battle, to di&s;play in the field the three crowns; and indeed he gave &s;ufficient proof that he was more devoted to Mars than to Chri&s;t, if &s;wearing, lewdne&s;s, and cruelty, are &s;ufficient proofs of it.</P>
<P>The Germans, provoked at the exactions and tyranny of the church of Rome, tendered a petition to the Emperor Maximilian: upon which he, in concert with the King of France, called a council, proclaimed to be held at Pi&s;a, May 15, 1511, to find ways and means, as it was pretended, to reform the church in its head, and in its members; tho', as Guicciardine affirms, tho&s;e pretended reformers were little better than Julius
<PB N="193" REF="208">him&s;elf. From Pi&s;a the council was transferred to Milan, where the fathers being a&s;&s;embled, they &s;um|moned, at &s;everal times, the Pope to appear before them in per&s;on: at length, upon his refu&s;ing, &s;u&s;pend|ed him from his office, and forbid his &s;ubjects paying obedience to him. From Milan the council was re|moved to Lyons; and at la&s;t all this bu&s;tle came to nothing.</P>
<P>Julius, to fru&s;trate their de&s;igns, calls another coun|cil at Lateran, or Latran, in 1512, wherein that of Pi&s;a, Milan, and Lyons, were condemned, and all its decrees declared void: nay, Lewis XII. was ex|communicated by Julius, and his kingdom &s;u&s;pended from divine &s;ervice. However, Pope Julius died Fe|bruary 21, 1513, during the &s;e&s;&s;ions of the Lateran coun|cil, and Pope Leo X. &s;ucceeded him. A change indeed, but very little for the better, as his luxury, his inju&s;tice, di&s;&s;imulation, and ingratitude, &s;tand upon record; but above all, his exorbitant exactions and cruelties render him notorious. The council of Lateran was con|tinued, and the holy fathers, as they are called, ap|plied them&s;elves rather to plunge the church into gro&s;|&s;er corruption, than to find ways to reform it. Lewis XII. was brought in to undo what he had done; and Francis I. who &s;ucceeded him, acceded to the Pope's mea&s;ures; and, in January 1515, came to an agreement to receive into his kingdom certain new con&s;titutions, called the Concordate, which had been drawn up by Mon&s;. Du Prat, to &s;erve in&s;tead of the pragmatic &s;anc|tion. This Concordate oppo&s;ed the rights and liber|ties of the Gallican church, and threw the nation of France into great tumults and warm debates. Such were the pretended Vicars of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and &s;upreme heads of his church, at the beginning of the 16th cen|tury; and we may ea&s;ily conceive, that &s;uch Popes took no care, to fill up what is called the &s;acred college, with per&s;ons truly pious and devout, but with tho&s;e
<PB N="194" REF="209">who were mo&s;t likely to &s;ub&s;erve their mercenary views, or rather ba&s;e purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Leo, knowing not how or where to find money to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of his luxury, created thirty Cardi|nals in one morning at 50,000 ducats each. The le|gates &s;ent to the different courts of Europe, were em|ployed as &s;o many incendiaries, to &s;tir up to war and blood&s;hed again&s;t every one who &s;hould dare to que&s;tion this divine right of the Pope, to approve or oppo&s;e whatever he thought proper. The re&s;t of the clergy were no better in general: Bi&s;hops were promoted purely from their attachment and eminent &s;ervices to the church of Rome; and e&s;pecially if they di&s;covered a di&s;po&s;ition to per&s;ecute tho&s;e whom the church deem|ed heretics.</P>
<P>Such was, in general, the deplorable &s;tate of the church, and it was the object of every good man's wi&s;h to &s;ee a reformation; and it had been the outward and profe&s;&s;ed intention of the councils of Pi&s;a, Milan, &amp;c. but the events give us but little proof of their &s;incerity.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this general corruption of the doc|trine and depravation of manners, there were &s;till &s;ome who had not bowed the knee to Baal; &s;ome of the Walden&s;es, who being forced out of their native coun|tries by cruel per&s;ecutions, had &s;heltered them&s;elves in France, Flanders, Germany, England, and Bohemia, and per&s;evered in the doctrine of Chri&s;t, without any mixture, at lea&s;t, in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential points; &s;o that their di&s;per&s;ion helped, not a little, to the information and reformation of many from tho&s;e &s;uper&s;titions.</P>
<P>Another thing that contributed much towards the re&s;toration of truth, was the re&s;toration of learning. The &s;ubver&s;ion of the Con&s;tantinopolitan empire in 1453, had occa&s;ioned many learned men to fly into Italy, France, Germany, and other parts, whereby the knowledge of &s;everal branches of learning, and particularly of the Greek tongue, &s;pread it&s;elf in greater
<PB N="195" REF="210">perfection. The benevolence and liberality of Francis I. incited by the great Budeus's &s;olicitations, enticed a great number into his dominions; by which, not only the original languages, but mo&s;t of the &s;ciences, ob|tained repute.</P>
<P>It was not long before the good effects thereof were vi&s;ible in that kingdom, and was preparatory to that happy change which happened to the church in the 16th century, when, enlightened by the re&s;toration of learning, they were a&s;hamed of the errors and &s;uper|&s;titions which had been impo&s;ed upon them; and it is no wonder then, if truth found &s;o free acce&s;s to their hearts, if it was greedily received by a va&s;t number of every rank and &s;ex in &s;o many countries of Europe, &s;ince they waited only, as it were, for a proper oppor|tunity to declare them&s;elves openly. Pope Leo, in 1520, afforded them that opportunity, by his in&s;atiable greedine&s;s, and intolerable extortions, exemplified in his bull of indulgences; whereupon Luther publi&s;hed his book, intitled <HI>The Babylonian Captivity.</HI> Such were the fir&s;t beginnings of the reformation in Germany, which &s;pread it&s;elf in a few years in &s;everal large pro|vinces of the empire, in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, England, Scotland, Switzerland, and was there ad|mitted, and became the national religion, though not under the &s;ame denomination.</P>
<P>But tho' it has never been the happine&s;s of France to have the reformation admitted and &s;ettled in it, in like manner, as to be the national religion; neverthe|le&s;s, all the malice, hatred, and per&s;ecutions of men, hindered not the truth from penetrating into it, and taking root in the hearts of a prodigious number of its &s;ubjects, and even among &s;ome of the clergy, particu|larly William Bri&s;&s;onnet, Bi&s;hop of Meaux, who coun|tenanced the reformation; but not being able to endure the per&s;ecution in 1522, recanted.</P>
<P>John Le Clerc, tho' a mean mechanic, was the fir&s;t martyr in France. After a &s;evere whipping in 1523,
<PB N="196" REF="211">he had the courage to e&s;tabli&s;h a reformed church at Lorrain, and &s;ealed the truth with his blood in 1524.</P>
<P>Francis I. per&s;ecuted the reformed, from the per&s;ua|&s;ion and in&s;inuation of Du^c Pratz, and other prie&s;ts, and many cruel executions en&s;ued.</P>
<P>A. D. 1532.] But Calvin comes about this time to Orleans, where, by his public preaching, he gained many pro&s;elytes. The reformation was likewi&s;e en|couraged at Thoulou&s;e: learning in general had been promoted, to which the illu&s;trious Scaliger not a little contributed. Per&s;ons of &s;ober minds began to em|brace the principles of the reformation; and &s;everal were impri&s;oned, and &s;ome burnt this year.</P>
<P>In 1533, Margaret, Queen of Navarre, countenanced the reformation, and &s;olicited the King of France not to proceed to rigorous mea&s;ures again&s;t them, and made no &s;mall impre&s;&s;ion on him; but the indi&s;creet zeal of &s;ome quite altered his good intentions, and made him publi&s;h a &s;evere placart again&s;t them in 1534, and another again&s;t the Lutherans, by which even tho&s;e who harboured or concealed them were made liable to the &s;ame puni&s;hment, and the informer to be intitled to the fourth part of their goods; in con|&s;equence of which, the per&s;ecution raged furiou&s;ly throughout all the provinces of that kingdom. Bran|tome gives us an account, that the King was advi&s;ed to begin at his own family, pointing to the Queen of Navarre, if he would extirpate heretics out of his king|dom; and though that advice was not taken, the King had &s;uch abettors, that &s;he found it nece&s;&s;ary for her own &s;afety not to interpo&s;e.</P>
<P>This year, 1535, a va&s;t number of martyrs &s;ealed the truth with their blood in France, in the Nether|lands, and in England; where Henry VIII. who had renounced the Pope's authority, rather from ambition and re&s;entment, than out of any principle of religion, per&s;ecuted with the utmo&s;t rigour tho&s;e who adhered to Luther's or Zuinglius's opinions.</P>
<PB N="197" REF="212">
<P>In 1536 the Anabapti&s;ts, who had made them|&s;elves ma&s;ters of the city of Mun&s;ter, were taken, and many of them &s;uffered.</P>
<P>In 1538 Julius Cae&s;ar Scaliger was impri&s;oned, for having &s;aid that Lent was not in&s;tituted by Chri&s;t or his apo&s;tles; that tran&s;ub&s;tantiation was not an article of faith before the council of Latran; and for having eat fle&s;h on fa&s;t days: but by the favour of La Cha&s;&s;aigne, chancellor of the Parliament of Bourdeaux, was di&s;|charged.</P>
<P>A Dominican friar was burnt at Agen, in the year 1539, the fir&s;t martyr in that city; and in 1540, one was burnt for refu&s;ing to kneel to an image, as he was going to the fair of Lyons.</P>
<P>The year 1540 was famous for the pa&s;&s;age of the Em|peror Charles V. thro' France, as he was going to Ghent, to puni&s;h &s;ome who had revolted from him. Many were likewi&s;e executed this year in France, on account of religion.</P>
<P>In 1542 Pope Paul III. appointed a council at Trent; but on account of a war which commenced in Italy, between the Emperor and the King of France, it was &s;u&s;pended.</P>
<P>The parliament of Rouen condemned one Con&s;tan|tine, and three others, to be burnt. The parliament of Paris, in order to &s;uppre&s;s the reformation, forbid, under &s;evere penalties, the &s;elling of any book, cen|&s;ured by the Sorbonne; and at the in&s;tance of the in|qui&s;ition, every one, under pain of excommunication, was to inform again&s;t &s;uch as they &s;u&s;pected of here&s;y within &s;ix days.</P>

<P>Calvin publi&s;hed an an&s;wer to them, and wrote with much wit per&s;picuity, and &s;trength of argument: neverthele&s;s, there was a great per&s;ecution this year at A$higny, and afterwards at Sens; and at Rouen, one Mr. Hu&s;&s;on was condemned by the parliament to be burnt, for having di&s;per&s;ed &s;ome pamphlets again&s;t the articles of the Sorbonne, which he &s;uffered with an un|common con&s;tancy, and upon which great numbers embraced Prote&s;tanti&s;m, in &s;pite of the per&s;ecution that threatened them.</P>
<P>We come now to that mo&s;t cruel and inhuman &s;laughter made of the poor Merindolans, and tho&s;e of Cabrieres, who were the immediate offspring of the Walden&s;es, who&s;e predece&s;&s;ors had been cruelly per|&s;ecuted in the reign of Lewis XII. about the year 1506.</P>
<P>Of this per&s;ecution Father Paola gives the following account. While, &s;ays he, they held a&s;&s;emblies at Trent to confute their here&s;y by the council's means, the &s;ame thing was done in France by the force of arms, again&s;t a part of the Walden&s;es dwelling in the mountains of Provence, and who had kept them&s;elves &s;eparated from the Roman &s;ee, following other tenets and ceremonies,
<PB N="199" REF="216">tho' gro&s;s and imperfect; but after the alterations that Zuinglius had made in his doctrine, they had &s;upplied by it the defects of their own, and had given &s;ome form to their ceremonies. This happened when Ge|neva received the reformation: for &s;ome years ago the parliament had i&s;&s;ued a decree again&s;t them, which had not as yet been put in execution; but now with a power|ful army, headed by the pre&s;ident of the parliament, again&s;t tho&s;e poor people, who having no thoughts of making defence, they put to the &s;word, in a cruel mer|cile&s;s manner, above 4000 in the town of Cabrieres in Provence, and Merindo, in the county of Vennai&s;&s;in, and afterwards pillaged and burnt the hou&s;es. Nay, &s;o many and great were their cruelties, that when it was related to the King, tho' he had approved of the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of tho&s;e he called heretics, he was &s;truck with horror, and would have brought &s;ome of the prin|cipal promoters of it to condign puni&s;hment; but they found means to e&s;cape, except Gueren, who was be|headed by order of the parliament at Paris.</P>
<P>This year it was much di&s;puted, whether it is lawful to di&s;&s;emble one's religion. The divines of Switzer|land, Geneva, and Germany, were con&s;ulted upon it; and tho' &s;ome were more rigid than others, yet they all agreed upon this point, that nobody can &s;erve two dif|ferent ma&s;ters of contrary intere&s;ts. Their re&s;pective an&s;wers were printed and publi&s;hed, which contributed not a little to the e&s;tabli&s;hment and encouragement of Prote&s;tants.</P>
<P>A. D. 1546.] This year is famous for the war kindled between the Emperor and the Prote&s;tants of Germany, and no le&s;s remarkable for the cruel per&s;ecution again&s;t the reformed at Meaux. The a&s;&s;embly had been di&s;|per&s;ed by a per&s;ecution in the year 1523; howbeit, they &s;prung up again, and became the envy of the Romi&s;h bigots, &s;o that a &s;udden and violent per&s;ecution com|menced again&s;t them. Fourteen were &s;entenced to be burnt alive, and their goods forfeited; others to be
<PB N="200" REF="217">publickly whipped, others impri&s;oned, and others bani&s;hed; and the mini&s;ter, Mr. Mangin, was ordered to have his tongue cut out before his execution. Other in&s;tances of per&s;ecution were frequent, as at Senlis, at Nonnay; and at Sens, one Mr. L'Anglois was burnt at the in&s;tance of his own uncle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See vol. i. p. 63.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>All this was effected by courts of ju&s;tice, e&s;tabli&s;hed in &s;everal places of the kingdom, to receive informa|tions again&s;t the reformed, and to try, condemn, and execute, without any appeal.</P>
<P>A. D. 1547.] This year died Henry VIII. King of England, al&s;o Francis I. King of France; both of them per&s;ecutors of Prote&s;tants: with this difference, that the former did it from principles of what he called religion; the latter was a per&s;ecutor rather out of policy than inclination, and, in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the dictates of the Popes, was almo&s;t always engaged in a war with the Emperor.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding all the cruel per&s;ecutions again&s;t the reformed, they every where increa&s;ed; and there were few towns in France, in which there were not Prote&s;|tants, tho' no regular churches or divine &s;ervice, but praying and &s;inging in places of retirement: for Henry II. who then &s;ucceeded to the throne, was a magna|nimous Prince, and of an ea&s;y temper; and would pro$$bly have connived at the increa&s;e of the Hugue|nots, as the reformed were then called, but there were &s;ome who gained an a&s;cendance over him, particularly the Cardinals Diana and St. Andrew. They gave the King to under&s;tand, that the reformed religion was no friend to the monarchical government, and the &s;pring of all confu&s;ion and di&s;orders; that the be&s;t way to hide, before God and man, the manifold &s;ins he was guilty of, was to de&s;troy utterly all the enemies of the ancient religion; and they prevailed &s;o far upon him, that executions became more frequent than in the former
<PB N="201" REF="218">reign, and particularly at Paris, where the burning chamber exerted it&s;elf with all that zeal which &s;uper|&s;tition doth commonly in&s;pire.</P>
<P>A. D. 1552.] The gag was put in u&s;e this year for the fir&s;t time, invented purpo&s;ely to hinder the poor martyrs from &s;peaking to the people, or &s;inging p&s;alms to comfort them&s;elves, as they were led to execution, or upon the pile. The fir&s;t, who &s;uffered it, was one Nicholas Nail, a book-hawker, who was executed at Paris in the mo&s;t barbarous manner.</P>
<P>The death of King Edward VI. that happened in July, proved to be a fatal blow in the reformed reli|gion in this kingdom; for Mary his &s;i&s;ter, who &s;uc|ceeded him, notwith&s;tanding the oppo&s;ition of the Duke of Northumberland, who endeavoured to fix Jane Gray, his daughter-in law, upon the throne; Mary, I &s;ay, was a very cruel and bloody per&s;ecutrix of her reformed &s;ubjects; in&s;omuch that their condition was in no wi&s;e better here during her reign than in France.</P>
<P>A. D. 1555.] The in&s;atiable avidity of Diana of Poitiers, after the many confi&s;cations of the effects of the reformed, more than a zeal of religion, occa&s;ioned every day new executions of the&s;e poor people: which however hindered not truth from taking a firmer root; in&s;omuch that, in the year 1555, &s;everal churches were &s;ettled with their own pa&s;tors, and governed by a re|gular di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of them was at Paris, in which many were &s;o exemplary for purity of manners, that many became pro&s;elytes to prote&s;tanti&s;m. This, however, was followed with new regulations for the trial and puni&s;hment of heretics. The Cardinal of Lorrain endeavours to have a tribunal of inqui&s;ition &s;ettled in France, like that of Spain.&mdash;The Cardinal, in order to gratify the Pope, and to render the per&s;ecution per|petual in France, after the pattern of the inqui&s;ition of Spain, in&s;inuated with the King, and obtained leave
<PB N="202" REF="219">to petition the Pope, to have &s;uch a &s;ettlement in his dominion; and le&s;t it &s;hould be thought the Cardinal required &s;uch an authority for him&s;elf, he de&s;ired the Pope to name the Cardinals of Bourbon and Chatil|lon, and join them with him in the office of inqui&s;i|tors general; and at the &s;ame time took care to have his emi&s;&s;aries to declare again&s;t the Prote&s;tants, tho' it was by the mo&s;t glaring fal&s;ehoods.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, there were &s;everal apologies wrote for the reformers. One was very &s;hort, but framed after &s;uch a manner, that the ancient doctors of the church were introduced, upholding the &s;ame cau&s;e with tho&s;e who were then &s;tiled heretics.</P>
<P>A. D. 1557.] Some of the Sorboni&s;ts undertook an an&s;wer to it. One was a doctor and inqui&s;itor, who, without pretending to any proof, a&s;&s;erted that the re|formed were heretics, and as &s;uch ought to be burnt; and left no &s;tone unturned to accompli&s;h his wi&s;h.</P>
<P>At length the King, being informed that a great number of reformers were impri&s;oned, and their cau&s;e ready to be heard, &s;ent his warrant to the court of parliament, to &s;uper&s;ede all other affairs, and to proceed extraordinarily upon this. In pur&s;uance of which nine were &s;entenced to be burnt, and were executed; among whom was a widow lady of twenty-three years of age, and an exqui&s;ite beauty, who was put to the torture, had her tongue cut out, her feet and face parched, was then &s;trangled, and burnt to a&s;hes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Laval, vol. i. p. 93.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Till this time there had been but few of the nobi|lity and gentry, who had embraced the reformation; but now three of the greate&s;t lords of the court de|clared them&s;elves for it; &s;ome Prince&s;&s;es, as al&s;o An|thony King of Navarre, fir&s;t Prince of the blood, Lewis of Bourbon, his brother Prince of Conde, and Francis Dandelot, brother to the Admiral Coligny.</P>
<P>The King of Navarre had countenanced the refor|mation in his own dominions. He was pre&s;ent at
<PB N="203" REF="220">&s;ome of their religious a&s;&s;emblies: nay, he went far|ther, for he went to the pri&s;on where &s;ome of them were confined, and procured their relea&s;e. The Prince of Conde, his mother-in-law, and his con&s;ort, followed the reformed doctrine, and made a public and &s;incere profe&s;&s;ion of it to the end of their lives.</P>
<P>The bloody de&s;igns of the Cardinal of Lorrain, again&s;t the reformed, were in a great mea&s;ure fru&s;|trated by the&s;e di&s;coveries: but what contributed more to his di&s;appointment, was the &s;olemn emba&s;&s;y of the Electors of Saxony, Brandenbourg, and Palatine of the Duke of Deux Ponts and Wittemburg. The King was plea&s;ed to an&s;wer to the&s;e Princes very graciou&s;ly, becau&s;e their friend&s;hip was nece&s;&s;ary to him at that time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Laval, vol. i. p. 98.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means the reformed church of Paris in|crea&s;ed daily; but it happened, that the reformed took a fancy to meet &s;ometimes in the Clerk's Meadow, a place where the Pari&s;ians u&s;ed to re&s;ort for the plea|&s;ure of walking;<NOTE PLACE="inter">Singing p&s;alms.</NOTE> and there they &s;ung Mariot's p&s;alms in metre, &s;et to very fine mu&s;ical tunes; which novelty was &s;o plea&s;ing, that va&s;t mul|titudes joined them, and &s;ung with them. Among others, the King and Queen of Navarre went thither, with &s;everal lords and gentlemen, both natives and foreigners, and walked &s;inging with the people.</P>
<P>But the clergy were terribly alarmed at this, and made u&s;e of all their influence to have tho&s;e a&s;&s;em|blies &s;uppre&s;&s;ed: for which rea&s;on, they &s;ent to the King, who was then at his camp at Amiens, and in|formed him that the Lutherans had rai&s;ed a &s;edition in the city of Paris, and that they had a&s;&s;embled together with pi&s;tols and other arms. When his Maje&s;ty heard this, he i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, forbidding all &s;uch meet|ings, under pain of being puni&s;hed as &s;editious, and di&s;turbers of the public peace. Cardinal Bertrandi, Lord Keeper, was &s;ent to inform again&s;t them; &s;ome of them were arre&s;ted, and committed to pri&s;on;
<PB N="204" REF="221">but it was found, that the cau&s;e of their commit|ment was not &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>There was &s;oon after a &s;ecret conference, held be|tween the Cardinal of Lorrain and the Cardinal Gran|ville, wherein that cunning mini&s;ter of Philip, in a very artificial &s;peech, gave Cardinal Lorrain to under|&s;tand, that the King his ma&s;ter was highly di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;ee per&s;ons, tainted with here&s;y, &s;o much in favour at the court of France; and named Dandelot.</P>
<P>A. D. 1558.] The Cardinal, being a vain and bu&s;y man, thinking to find his account in the new di&s;covery he had made, becau&s;e he knew that the ba&s;e &s;u&s;picion of here&s;y was enough to incite King Henry to ruin his greate&s;t favourite, came to the King, and told him what he had learnt in a conference with the Bi&s;hop of Arras. The King thereupon ordered the Cardinal of Chatillon, and the Duke of Montmorency, to wait upon that Lord, and di&s;po&s;e him to give &s;ome &s;ati&s;|factory account of his religion; for he heartily wi&s;hed, that he &s;hould not be found guilty of the crime of here&s;y, with which he &s;tood charged.</P>
<P>Dandelot, being &s;ummoned, came to Monceaux, where the King was. He was admitted to his au|dience, while the King &s;at at dinner; his Maje&s;ty talk|ed to him of the many favours he had be&s;towed upon him, and that he heard, with much concern, that he entertained very bad notions about religion. He charged him with having cau&s;ed the new doctrine to be preached in his hou&s;e, with having been in the Clerk's Meadow, with his forbearing to hear ma&s;s, and al&s;o with his having &s;ent &s;ome books of Lutherani&s;m to the Admiral his brother.</P>
<P>Dandelot an&s;wered with great firmne&s;s of mind, and declared his opinion about the tenets of the church of Rome in very &s;trong terms. The King exhorted him, in a friendly manner, to take care of him&s;elf, to provide for his own &s;ecurity, and avert the danger
<PB N="205" REF="222">while it was time. Dandelot not being moved, $n|&s;wered to this purpo&s;e.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>&startq;I &s;tand &s;o far indebted to your Maje&s;ty's good|ne&s;s for the many favours and honours conferred upon me, that as I never &s;pared, &s;o in duty bound I will never &s;pare my fortune nor life for your Ma|je&s;ty's &s;ervice. But after having done my duty to|wards your Maje&s;ty, don't take it ami&s;s, I be&s;eech you, if I &s;pend the re&s;t of my time to work out my &s;alvation. The doctrine, which as I confe&s;s I have cau&s;ed to be preached, is pure and holy, taken out of the Old and New Te&s;tament, approved of by the antient councils and the divines of the primitive church; and is the &s;ame which our forefathers have held and believed. I have not been in the Clerk's Meadow, as has been reported to your Maje&s;ty; but if I had been there, I &s;hould not think I had done any thing again&s;t God or your Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice; for after an exact inquiry of what has been done in that place, I find that nothing has been done, but to &s;ing the p&s;alms of David, and to pray to God for the pre&s;ervation and welfare of your Maje&s;ty and of your dominions. I confe&s;s that I have not heard ma&s;s for a long time; but I did not ab&s;ent my&s;elf from churches or chapels, but for good rea&s;ons, which your Maje&s;ty would approve of, if you would be at the trouble of con&s;idering and weighing them. It is likewi&s;e true, that I have &s;ent to my brother, the Admiral, a book very proper to comfort him in his long captivity, which he has &s;uffered for your Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice. So I be&s;eech your Maje&s;ty to leave my con&s;cience at liberty, and to di&s;po&s;e of my fortune and life, which are entirely your's, ju&s;t as &endq;you &s;hall think fit.</P>

<P>The King was extremely &s;urpri&s;ed at this an&s;wer; and the Cardinal, who waited only for an opportu|nity to ruin that Lord, told him to think of what he had &s;aid, for he was in a very bad way. To which Dandelot replied, "My Lord Cardinal, I am very well &s;atisfied as to my doctrine, and you know better than you talk. I appeal to your con&s;cience, if you have not been a favourer of that holy doctrine: but the honours and dignities of this world have quite al|tered your mind, and you are become a per&s;ecutor of the true members of Chri&s;t's body."</P>
<P>At this the King was greatly enraged, and was &s;o far exa&s;perated, that he fell into very indecent actions, and would have killed him. In this attempt he wounded the Dauphin his &s;on, who &s;tood near him. Dandelot was &s;ent to pri&s;on, and deprived of all his places; but the con&s;table found means to have him &s;et at liberty, on condition of his hearing ma&s;s in his pri&s;on; to which he con&s;ented by the &s;olicitations of his lady, though he paid no regard to the performance. He was afterwards very &s;en&s;ible of his own weakne&s;s, and penitent for his fault all the days of his life.</P>
<P>Mary Queen of England died the 17th of Novem|ber. By her death England was delivered of a cruel per&s;ecution, which had la&s;ted her whole reign. Cardinal Pool died about &s;eventeen hours after. Queen Eliza|beth a&s;cends the throne, and the re&s;toration of the re|formed religion followed of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>A. D. 1559.] There was likewi&s;e a great increa&s;e of the reformed churches in France. Mezeray &s;ays, there was no town, no province, where the new opinions had not taken root; the lawyers, the learned, and even eccle&s;ia&s;tics, again&s;t their own intere&s;t, embraced them. The executions proved a means to &s;pread them, and give them new life, in&s;omuch that &s;everal members of the parliament, &s;ome out of a meek and merciful nature, others from conviction of the truth, thought
<PB N="207" REF="224">and intimated that tho&s;e too rigorous penalties ought to be mitigated.</P>
<P>The King, however, pre&s;&s;ed the execution of his edict of Chateau-Briant. He &s;ent orders to the par|liament of Paris to that effect; but, as it happened, four of the principal reformed, that had been impri|&s;oned, were ju&s;t di&s;charged: &s;ome, however, who&s;e bigotry and inveteracy again&s;t the Prote&s;tants run very high, were not wanting to in&s;inuate in his Ma|je&s;ty's ears, that here&s;y prevailed; and inferring, that wherever the divine rights of Kings were infringed, it tended to &s;ubver&s;ion and ruin; and for this purpo&s;e &s;everal artful coun&s;els were employed to incite his Ma|je&s;ty, by the mo&s;t fallacious repre&s;entations, to the ut|mo&s;t cruelties and per&s;ecutions, &s;uch as had been u&s;ed again&s;t the Albigen&s;es.</P>
<P>A. D. 1559.] The edict, before referred to, was fir&s;t publi&s;hed in 1539, but put in force five years after|wards by Lewis XII. by which the &s;olicitor or attorney general was not only to receive any informations brought again&s;t the promoters of the new religion, but al&s;o to take cognizance of all &s;uch as had been informed concerning them, and who, through tenderne&s;s or want of re&s;olu|tion, had not put the laws in execution again&s;t them.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the &s;evere mea&s;ures that &s;eemed to be pur&s;uing&punc; &s;ome per&s;ons of great wi&s;dom, repu|tation and influence, pre&s;umed to di&s;cover their un|willingne&s;s to act as their office obliged them, and cho&s;e to re&s;ign their places. Mon&s;ieur de Thou, with his u&s;ual freedom and integrity, oppo&s;ed with all his might that de&s;ign, which he fore&s;aw would be &s;o fatal to his Maje&s;ty and to the kingdom.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e remon&s;trances, the King went to the parliament on the 10th of June; and when he was &s;eated on his throne, he &s;poke about religion and the public tranquillity in a manner which plainly di&s;|covered, that he was come thither with a bitter ra|ther than a &s;edate heart. Then he told them, that he
<PB N="208" REF="225">had procured peace to the Chri&s;tian world, by the marriage of his daughter and of his &s;i&s;ter, and was in hopes, that it would be advantageous to his people, and a la&s;ting one; but that he was vexed to his heart, under&s;tanding that &s;ome, taking advantage of his wars, had handled the matters of religion in &s;uch a tumultuary and &s;editious manner, as they had done. Wherefore he de&s;ired for the future, to apply him&s;elf entirely to the healing of tho&s;e evils which the di&s;putes about religion had occa&s;ioned in the Chri&s;tian world; and under&s;tanding, that they were a&s;&s;embled for that purpo&s;e, he exhorted them to judge of that matter with a perfect integrity; for that it was the cau&s;e of God, to which there was no doubt but he was pre|&s;ent him&s;elf, and knew perfectly well all their thoughts and de&s;igns.</P>
<P>Then the Cardinal Keeper of the &s;eals commanded them to go on with their votes; and though it was obvious enough to every one, that the King was come only on purpo&s;e to dive into their thoughts, and to re&s;train the freedom of votes; yet many of them, at the peril of their lives, agreeable to their dignity, in|veighed again&s;t the Roman court's manners, and bad u&s;ages, which had degenerated into mo&s;t pernicious errors, which had been the occa&s;ion of &s;o many &s;ects, which multiplied them&s;elves every where. They were of opinion to mitigate the puni&s;hments, and to put a &s;top to the &s;everity of the judgments, till the diffe|rences in religion &s;hould be compo&s;ed, and the di&s;ci|pline of the church re&s;tored by the authority of an oecumenical council.</P>
<P>The confe&s;&s;ion of faith was drawn up in forty arti|cles, which has been con&s;tantly followed by the re|formed churches in France, and is &s;till by all who go by the name of Calvini&s;ts, and which agree in all e&s;&s;ential points with that of the church of England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Laval, p. 117&mdash;139.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>That they had heard with great &s;orrow, that &s;undry good men, lovers of peace, who profe&s;&s;ed the &s;ame re|ligion as they, were dealt with in France as if they were &s;editious per&s;ons, and di&s;turbers of the public tranquillity, being clapt in pri&s;on, deprived of their goods, &s;ent into exile, nay, put to death for their re|ligion. For which rea&s;on they had &s;ent to the King, being moved by a Chri&s;tian love and charity, and by that friend&s;hip which was &s;ettled between them, the King and the kingdom of France, de&s;iring him that he would be plea&s;ed to decree nothing in a matter of that moment, wherein the glory of God, and the &s;al|vation of &s;o many &s;ouls, were concerned, without hav|ing weighed the rea&s;ons of each &s;ide; and not to &s;uffer him&s;elf to be bia&s;&s;ed by any prejudicate opinion; that being &s;olicitous, as it behoves good Princes, no le&s;s
<PB N="210" REF="227">than the King him&s;elf, for the glory of God, their own and their people's &s;alvation, they had &s;earched to find means how to compo&s;e the&s;e troubles rai&s;ed on account of religion; that they had found many things introduced into the church, through the avarice and ambition of men, which redounded to the di&s;honour of God, and afforded a ju&s;t occa&s;ion of &s;candal, which therefore ought to be reformed according to the word of God, the decrees of the antient councils, and the authority of the fathers of the fir&s;t centuries; that the complaints again&s;t the corruption and depravation of the Roman court were not new; that it was well known that great many divines had written about the&s;e things; that Francis I. his father knew very well what was to be done, and had once very wi&s;ely undertook to compo&s;e the differences of religion, and to reform the eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;cipline; that &s;uch a work was worth the care of a King born of &s;uch a father: therefore they intreated him to take it upon him; and &s;ince the kingdom of France was in peace with its neighbours abroad, to endeavour to terminate the dif|ferences of religion in a peaceable and friendly way under his own authority. That the be&s;t way for that purpo&s;e would be, to chu&s;e &s;ome learned men, lovers of peace, to debate the controverted points without bitterne&s;s or hatred, and to draw a confe&s;&s;ion of faith, grounded upon the &s;criptures and the ancient fathers, to be pre&s;ented to him. In the mean while, to cau&s;e the per&s;ecution to cea&s;e; to &s;et the pri&s;oners for reli|gion's &s;ake at liberty; to recall tho&s;e who had been bani&s;hed; to re&s;tore to their goods and e&s;tates tho&s;e who had been deprived of them. That in doing &s;o, the King would do a thing very acceptable to God, very honourable to him&s;elf, u&s;eful to his kingdom, and ex|tremely agreeable to them, who had &s;ent tho&s;e envoys to intreat him in behalf of tho&s;e poor wretches; their cau&s;e being as it were a common cau&s;e with them,
<PB N="211" REF="228">and they &s;hould &s;tand much obliged to him for the regard he &s;hould pay to their recommendation.</P>
<P>The King received the amba&s;&s;adors very graciou&s;ly; and told them that he would give them a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer; but they were no &s;ooner upon the frontiers, than the fires, which had been thought extingui&s;hed by the coming of the&s;e envoys, were kindled again, and burnt with greater fury than ever.</P>
<P>The following relation being not only adapted to our purpo&s;e, but may likewi&s;e entertain and gratify the reader, we give it a place as follows:</P>
<P>A company of comedians arrived at Navarre; one day they gave notice by the public crier, that they had a piece of importance to act that day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. i. p. 151, and ends p. 153.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The King and Queen, with all their court, came, and there was a crowded audience of all &s;orts of people. They repre&s;ented a &s;ick woman at the point of death, &s;hrieking, and begging earne&s;tly to be confe&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The pari&s;h-prie&s;t was &s;ent for; he came, in all his apparels, and did what he could; but the &s;ick woman was always in a to&s;s, crying, that &s;he was not well confe&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Some other eccle&s;ia&s;tics came, who &s;ucceeded no better than the pari&s;h-prie&s;t. After them came &s;ome friars of different orders, and &s;pared nothing to relieve her; beads, reliques, indulgences, of which they had their bags full, and which they did read one after another to the &s;ick; all was put in u&s;e, but to no purpo&s;e. At la&s;t they put on her St. Francis's habit, as their la&s;t remedy; but the woman found no relief nor re&s;t in her con&s;cience, and &s;aid, bemoaning her &s;ad condition, that the&s;e people under&s;tood not how to confe&s;s aright. At which &s;omebody of her acquain|tance came to her upon the &s;tage, and, lurking every where, as if he was afraid to be heard, whi&s;pered to her, that he knew a man who would confe&s;s her right, and put her con&s;cience in a &s;tate of peace and
<PB N="212" REF="229">tranquillity, but that that man went abroad only in the night-time, becau&s;e the day-light was noxious to him. The woman earne&s;tly de&s;ired her friend to call for that man; he came in a lay-dre&s;s, and drawing near the bol&s;ter, he &s;poke to the woman without being heard by the company; but they ob&s;erved by her ge&s;|tures that &s;he was mighty well plea&s;ed. At la&s;t he took a &s;mall book out of his pocket, and &s;aid aloud unto her, This book contains the mo&s;t infallible receipts for the cure of your di&s;ea&s;e; if you will make u&s;e of them, you &s;hall recover your health perfectly well in a few days. Then he went off the &s;tage, and the &s;ick woman got out of her bed chearful, being perfectly cured; and having walked two or three times upon the &s;tage, &s;he told the audience, that that man un|known, had wrought what had been impo&s;&s;ible to the former, who had vi&s;ited her; and that &s;he was obliged to confe&s;s, that his book was full of receipts, as they might &s;ee by that happy change that happened in her; that if any of them was afflicted with the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, &s;he advi&s;ed them to con&s;ult the book, which &s;he would readily lend them; forewarning them, however, that they would find it &s;omething hot in handling, and that a noi&s;ome&s;cent would come out of it, like that of a faggot; that for the re&s;t, if the audience de&s;ired to know her name, and the book's name, they were two riddles which they might gue&s;s at.</P>
<P>The King and Queen were plea&s;ed to expre&s;s their &s;atisfaction; the whole court followed their example, and a great number of auditors did the &s;ame; many of whom already di&s;liked the Roman religion.</P>
<P>They under&s;tood perfectly well, that the &s;ick woman was truth; that the fir&s;t who could not confe&s;s her right, were tho&s;e who took upon them the character of doctors and pa&s;tors, and who, in&s;tead of whole&s;ome directions, admini&s;tered nothing but what can &s;erve only for an amu&s;ement to babies: that the la&s;t-comer was one of tho&s;e pretended heretics, whom the &s;eve|rity
<PB N="213" REF="230">of the times obliged to conceal them&s;elves, and who alone did rightly confe&s;s, when they were called for. La&s;tly, that the hot book, which &s;melt of the faggot, was the Holy Bible, forbdiden to be kept at home, and to be read in the vulgar tongue, under pain of fire.</P>
<P>But what plea&s;ed much to &s;ome, di&s;plea&s;ed as much to others; particularly, the ecclea&s;ia&s;tics were greatly offended at it. They made their complaints to the King, then to the magi&s;trates, and made &s;uch a noi&s;e, that the comedians were obliged to leave the city &s;ud|denly and &s;ecretly. They would have been dealt with in a much &s;everer manner, had it not been for the King and Queen, to whom that company belonged.</P>
<P>I hope this digre&s;&s;ion will not be unplea&s;ing to the reader, &s;ince it is a &s;ubject, the con&s;equence of which was the conver&s;ion of many inhabitants, and the in|crea&s;e of the reformed church of that city; which was &s;uch, that they elected twelve per&s;ons, who, with the mini&s;ter, made up the ve&s;try: they had no fixed place for their a&s;&s;embly, but they met together &s;ometimes in one, &s;ometimes in another place, and that in the night-time, for fear of being di&s;covered, which was likewi&s;e ob&s;erved by all the churches throughout the kingdom.</P>

<P>To clo&s;e this year<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 206.</NOTE>, we &s;hall ob&s;erve, that the Sor|boni&s;ts, and other preachers, incen&s;ed &s;o much the people by their &s;ermons, repre&s;enting the reformed as men without God, as enemies to the King, that they ran to that degree of madne&s;s and cruelty, as to pull them out of the hands of the common hangman, when they were led to be executed, and to torment them in a thou&s;and ways; and for the better di&s;covery of them, being moved thereto, either by their own &s;uper&s;tition, or by zealots, they took a freak to &s;et up images at the corners of the &s;treets, and to force all that went by to &s;alute them; and they that refu&s;ed it, were ac|counted to be favourably dealt with, if they were only put in pri&s;on, after having been mangled and dragged in the dirt, becau&s;e &s;uch a refu&s;al was reckoned a mark of here&s;y. They had al&s;o &s;ome boxes like tho&s;e of the churches for the poor, which they pre&s;ented to the pa&s;&s;ers-by, a&s;king money to buy wax-tapers and lights, and other &s;uch things; they who refu&s;ed being in dan|ger of being killed. Nay, there were among&s;t them &s;ome rakes unwilling to pay their debts, who followed their creditors till they came into &s;ome bye-&s;treets, then they began to cry after them, A Lutheran! a Luthe|ran! or a Chri&s;tandin! a Chri&s;tandin! (for the word Huguenot was not yet in u&s;e) at which the mob ran in fury upon the poor men, and often di&s;patched them out of the way.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the reformed were thus outrageou&s;ly handled, the threats again&s;t the greate&s;t Lords of the kingdom, the wrong done to the Prince&s;s of the blood, and other great Lords, the corruption of the chief Ma|gi&s;trates who were devoted to the Gui&s;es, the King's ex|chequer, that was at their di&s;po&s;al, as well as all the
<PB N="215" REF="234">offices and benefices of the kingdom; in a word, their government violent and unlawful in it&s;elf: the&s;e things, put all together, drew upon them the odium of all, and rou&s;ed many great Lords, as it were, out of a deep &s;lumber; many combined together for their own de|fence, and to draw a &s;cheme for &s;ettling the govern|ment on the antient footing, as the laws ordered it.</P>
<P>The reformed performed publickly divine wor&s;hip at Valence, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The&s;e broils, however, hindered not the number of the reformed from increa&s;ing daily in all the provinces of France; they held public a&s;&s;emblies every where, their boldne&s;s increa&s;ing with their number; for, at Valence, in Dauphine, Peter Brule had already preached, to whom &s;ucceeded Gilles Santal of Montpelier, under who&s;e management the reformation made a very great progre&s;s; for he u&s;ed to preach every night in the public &s;chools. He was &s;ucceeded by Lancelot, of a noble family in Anjou, who had as good &s;ucce&s;s in his mini&s;try as his predece&s;&s;ors.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Laval, vol. i. p. 283.</NOTE></P>
<P>While the&s;e things were doing, Buriac received a proclamation from court, after the tumult of Amboi&s;e was over, by which the King offered his pardon for all that was pa&s;t, provided they returned to the re|ligion of their ance&s;tors. To this proclamation John de Monluc, Bi&s;hop of Valence, joined a letter to the people of his dioce&s;e. The proclamation was read at Valence in the a&s;&s;embly of the Magi&s;trates and Bur|ge&s;&s;es of the city. Buriac affected, in a &s;et &s;peech, to extol the King's clemency; and having exhorted them to obey, and to pray to God for his Maje&s;ty's pre|&s;ervation, he a&s;ked the a&s;&s;embly, whether they had a mind to make u&s;e of the benefit of the proclamation? Mirabel an&s;wered, that his a&s;&s;ociates were not u&s;ed to begin any thing, without having fir&s;t called upon God; and made, with Buriac's con&s;ent, a &s;ign to one De Saillant, deacon among the reformed of that place,
<PB N="216" REF="235">who kneeling down immediately, as well as the re&s;t of the a&s;&s;embly, made a prayer that was repeated by all except the eccle&s;ia&s;tics; who &s;eeing them&s;elves expo|&s;ed to the &s;corn of the people, &s;tood up, not without fear.</P>
<P>The prayer being ended, the reformed an&s;wered, that they would mo&s;t willingly obey the King. As to the grace tendered to them by the proclamation, they &s;tood in no u&s;e of it, &s;ince they had never con&s;pired again&s;t the King, n$r plotted again&s;t the &s;tate; that they had only &s;ought after liberty of con&s;cience, and, in order to maintain it, had &s;ettled lawful a&s;&s;emblies; concern|ing the re&s;t, they had always &s;tudied the public peace, and prayed for the King in their meetings: having taken up arms only for their private &s;ecurity, and not to di&s;turb the public tranquillity, they had no need of pardon, &s;ince they had not offended:&mdash;which greatly exa&s;perated the Duke of Gui&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Laval, vol. i. p. 282.</NOTE></P>

<P>The number of the reformed was &s;o great in Britanny, and in Normandy, that they preached in public, par|ticularly at Caen, St. Lo, and Dieppe. At their ex|ample, tho&s;e of Rouen, by the incon&s;iderate zeal of the younger &s;ort, which prevailed again&s;t the prudent coun&s;els of the old, undertook to preach in public. Some of the members of the parliament, who ad|hered, advi&s;ed them to avoid &s;hewing them&s;elves in &s;uch public manner.</P>
<P>A &s;choolma&s;ter who had embraced the tenets of the Anabapti&s;ts, having been bani&s;hed from Geneva, and interdicted from all office in the church, opened a public &s;chool at Rouen, pretending to teach three tongues together in a &s;hort time, after a very ea&s;y method. He began to preach in an open field to a numerous au|dience, even of tho&s;e that condemned his opinion. He
<PB N="217" REF="236">&s;aid, that God had revealed very marvellous things unto him, and e&s;pecially, that the Antichri&s;t was to be ca&s;t down from his throne by force of arms; that he was the man God had elected to be general of his army to de&s;troy all the &s;inners upon earth; and that he was commanded to kill all the bad Princes and Magi&s;trates; and that he had received this rare gift from God, and &s;hould not die before he had created a new world, free from all manner of &s;in. Then he exhorted his hearers to take up arms with him, and &s;aid it was not &s;trange that the enterpri&s;e of Amboi&s;e had mi&s;carried, &s;ince he had not been called to it: as he held forth he made &s;uch contor&s;ions of his mouth, at every word &s;hut his eyes, hanged his head down, drew his tongue, and made &s;uch figures, as a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, &s;o that &s;ome laughed at him; but he impo&s;ed upon &s;everal, among&s;t whom were two of his kin&s;men, who had harboured him in their hou&s;e, and countenanced his doctrine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Laval, vol. i. p. 310.</NOTE></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the oppo&s;ition and the &s;everities exerci&s;ed towards the reformed, the churches prevailed and increa&s;ed in many places, at Blois, at Tours, at Angers, at Rouen, at Luneray, at Poitiers and Cha|telleraud.</P>
<P>At this time the tumults already mentioned aro&s;e in Dauphine. This obliged the Gui&s;es and others, enemies to the reformed, to di&s;&s;emble, and be more cir|cum&s;pect in their behaviour towards them, than they would have been otherwi&s;e. The Bi&s;hop of Montepelier feigned to be in a great fright, and affecting to give out that he was not &s;afe enough in his epi&s;copal palace, he retired into the ca&s;tle of St. Peter, where he was fol|lowed by the Chief Ju&s;tice and &s;ome others; and it was found afterwards that they had melted in it &s;everal relicks, among the re&s;t a large &s;ilver head of St. Blai&s;e, of which they made money, to play at dice and cards with.</P>

<P>Now Mon&s;. la Cha&s;&s;e, alias Maupeau, mini&s;ter at Montpelier, by the advice of the elders and deacons, began to preach in the day-time, at &s;even o'clock in the morning, in the great &s;chool of Montpelier; of which the Magi&s;trates having taken notice, they &s;ent on the 24th of September the Judge-criminal to the a&s;&s;embly, with the con&s;uls and &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial citizens, who being come before the &s;ermon was begun, every one &s;trove to pay them the greate&s;t re&s;pect. Then in a &s;et &s;peech he &s;hewed forth the great evils ari&s;ing from unlawful a&s;&s;emblies; he expatiated much upon the &s;ects of the Libertines and Nicolaits, who refu&s;ed to acknowledge any King, Prince or Magi&s;|trate, and from thence took occa&s;ion to charge that a&s;&s;embly with a breach of the King's edicts, by which they were forbidden to meet together, or to bear arms. To conclude, he a&s;ked them three que&s;tions!
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. If they did not acknowledge Francis II. for their only true, natural and &s;overeign Prince?</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. If they were not re&s;olved to keep his laws, ordinances and edicts?</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. If they did not acknowledge him as well as the other Magi&s;trates of Montpelier, for the Magi&s;trates and Superiors e&s;tabli&s;hed by the King?</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>To this Mon&s;. la Cha&s;&s;e, mini&s;ter, an&s;wered for all, That, thanks to God, the errors of the Nicolaits and Libertines did not concern them; and that if any of their a&s;&s;embly was guilty of &s;edition or rebellion, they con&s;ented that he &s;hould be taken and puni&s;hed according to law, &s;o far were they from countenancing men of &s;uch principles; only it was the Magi&s;trates duty to con&s;ider, le&s;t they &s;hould be impo&s;ed upon by &s;light appearances. And in an&s;wer to the three que&s;|tions, he &s;aid that he acknowledged Francis II. for their only true, lawful King, and their &s;overeign Prince under God, and the Magi&s;trates of Montpelier for their lawful &s;uperiors; and they always thought them|&s;elves in duty bound to &s;ubmit their fortunes and $$$es to the King.</P>
<PB N="219" REF="238">
<P>As to their a&s;&s;embly, they did not think that his Maje&s;ty had any intention to hinder his &s;ubjects to live in a Chri&s;tian way, according to the pure word of God, nor to rule over their con&s;ciences, that right belonging to God only. As to the bearing of arms, he might certify, that, &s;ince his return to Montpelier, none of the a&s;&s;embly was guilty of it; and he thought that no body could make with ju&s;tice any complaint again&s;t any of them, of which they would be always very careful.</P>
<P>This an&s;wer was followed with the applau&s;e of all the congregation, who lifted up their hands, affirm|ing that they would be always faithful and obedient to God, to the King and the Magi&s;trates. Then one of the deacons de&s;ired the Judge, that, to avoid for the future all manner of offence, and not be obnoxious to the calumnies of their enemies, he would be plea&s;ed to grant them a church, where he &s;hould think proper, that they might meet together at &s;ettled times, and where they them&s;elves might come, and be witne&s;&s;es of all that &s;hould be &s;aid or done.</P>
<P>To this the Judge an&s;wered, that he was mighty well plea&s;ed with the re&s;pect and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion they did &s;how for his Maje&s;ty and his officers; but as to their la&s;t petition, far from granting them a church, he forbad them, in the King's name, to a&s;&s;emble any more, &s;ince that was contrary to the King's will, as they knew them&s;elves; and if they did not like &s;uch a prohibition, they ought to make their addre&s;s to the King, in order to have their grievances redre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>While the prelates were di&s;puting concerning the points above&s;aid, the mini&s;ters deputed by the reformed churches arrived at St. Germain, among&s;t whom were Augu&s;tin Marlorat, Francis de St. Pol.

The Queen received him very graciou&s;ly; and an&s;wered, that &s;he &s;hould be very glad, if the re&s;ult of their conferences tended to &s;ettle a &s;olid peace and quietne&s;s in the kingdom. Then the Cardinal of Lorrain &s;aid, that he knew M. de Beze by his writings, and exhorted him to &s;eek for peace and concord; adding expre&s;sly, that as he had di&s;turbed the kingdom, though ab&s;ent from it, now his coming might &s;erve to pacify it. To which De Beze replied, that he was too incon&s;iderable in all re|&s;pects for being able to di&s;turb the peace of &s;o great a kingdom; be&s;ide which, he had never been &s;o wicked as to attempt any &s;uch thing, as he had made it ap|pear &s;ufficiently by his writings, and as he would, with God's help, evince it in the conferences.</P>
<P>De Beze was then examined by the Queen, touching two books he had wrote, and &s;ome &s;uppo&s;ed heretical tenets, advanced in them in relation to the euchari&s;t; but the charges were &s;o gro&s;s, and nothing to &s;upport them, that the Queen &s;oon dropt her allegations.</P>
<P>De Beze a&s;ked him mode&s;tly, whether there had not been always a church &s;ince the beginning of the world? He an&s;wered, Yes. Whether the church had not been always a church under the mediator between God and man? He owned it. Whether Je&s;us Chri&s;t, true God and true man, was not that mediator? To which he agreed. From thence Beze inferred, that the faithful communication of Je&s;us Chri&s;t could not be re&s;trained to the time in which he had really united his godhead with our nature, &s;ince what was not exi&s;tent according to the order of nature, had been always pre&s;ent to the eyes of faith, as to its virtue and efficaciou&s;ne&s;s; quoting upon this what is &s;aid, that Abraham had &s;een the day of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and was glad; and St. Paul to the Corinthians, that the ancients did all eat
<PB N="222" REF="241">the &s;ame &s;piritual meat, and did all drink the &s;ame &s;piritual drink, that is, Je&s;us Chri&s;t; which the Cardi|nal granted, adding farther what is &s;aid in the revela|tion, of the lamb that has been &s;lain &s;ince the founda|tion of the world.</P>
<P>This gave occa&s;ion to De Beze to declare more fully in what con&s;i&s;ts the difference between the old and new covenant; which failed not to breed another que&s;|tion, viz. How the&s;e words, <HI>this is my body,</HI> were then to be under&s;tood? We cannat agree, &s;ays the Cardinal, upon that point, which is neverthele&s;s of great moment. I own it, &s;ays De Beze; but though I am &s;orry that there is no better agreement between us who call our&s;elves Chri&s;tians, yet I had rather hear that, than if we were made to believe, that we agree perfectly well on a point on which we di&s;agree &s;o much. Then, &s;ays the Cardinal, I teach the children of my dioce&s;e to an&s;wer, when they are a&s;ked, what is the bread of euchari&s;t? that it is the body of Chri&s;t. Do you di&s;approve my method? No, quoth De Beze; for it is the very language of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. But the query is, in what &s;en&s;e mu&s;t the&s;e words be taken, and how the bread is Chri&s;t's body? For whatever is &s;ome|thing, it is not always in the &s;ame &s;ort what it is. This afforded them occa&s;ion of talking of the &s;acramental locutions. At la&s;t De Beze &s;aid, that this argument could be reduced under four heads: the fir&s;t, concern|ing the &s;igns; the &s;econd, concerning the thing &s;igni|fied; the third, concerning the conjunction of the &s;igns, with the thing &s;ignified? the fourth, concerning the par|ticipation of the &s;igns with the thing &s;ignified by them. As to the &s;ign, we do not agree together, becau&s;e you do not acknowledge any other &s;ign in the Lord's &s;upper, but &s;ome accidents; while we keep the &s;ub&s;tance of bread and wine, according to the nature of the &s;acraments, and the declarations of the &s;criptures. No, no, &s;ays the Cardinal, and I hope I &s;hall be able to defend tran&s;ub&s;tantiation: but it would have been better if the divines had not
<PB N="223" REF="242">moved that que&s;tion; and for my part, I am not of opinion that the church &s;hould be divided on that account.</P>
<P>As to the &s;econd point, &s;ays De Beze, we do not &s;ay that the merits of the death and pa&s;&s;ion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the only thing &s;ignified by the bread and wine, but the true body that has been crucified by us, and the true blood that has been &s;hed for us; in a word, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf, true God and true man, is &s;ignified by tho&s;e vi&s;ible &s;igns to lift our hearts and thoughts to heaven, and behold him there by faith, and be partakers of his riches and trea&s;ures in the everla&s;ting life, as truly and certainly as we &s;ee with our eyes, take with our hands, eat and drink with our mouths, the vi&s;ible and corporal &s;igns. To this the Cardinal agreed, and &s;aid that he was very glad of hearing &s;uch an expo&s;ition; for he had been told, that they held other tenets upon the matter.</P>
<P>As to the third point, we own, &s;aid De Beze, that there is a va&s;t difference between the common bread and wine, and the bread and wine of the communion; for the common water, the common bread and wine, are but common and natural creatures, &s;uch as it has plea&s;ed God to create them; but the bread and wine of the Lord's &s;upper are &s;acraments, that is, vi&s;ible &s;igns of the precious body and blood of our Lord. But we &s;ay, that this mutation, by which natural things become &s;acraments, does not happen in the &s;ub&s;tance of things which remain integral, but only in the u&s;e, which is quite different from that to which they are naturally de&s;tined, for they are naturally created for the body's food; but being made &s;acraments, they repre&s;ent our &s;piritual food. Furthermore, we do not a&s;cribe that &s;acramental mutation, either to the virtue of &s;ome words uttered, or to the intent of him who utters them; but to the virtue and power of Almighty God, who&s;e will and ordinance is te&s;tified unto us by his word. Therefore, as the thing &s;ignified is offered, and given
<PB N="224" REF="243">unto us by our Lord, as truly as the &s;igns of it, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily acknowledge, that in that re&s;pect, and no otherwi&s;e, the &s;igns are conjoined with the things &s;ignified; and that the body and blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which in that re&s;pect are truly given and communi|cated unto us, are truly pre&s;ent in the euchari&s;t: not that they can be found either under or with, or in the bread and wine, or in any other place be&s;ides heaven, into which Je&s;us Chri&s;t is a&s;cended, to be there con|tained as to his humanity, till he comes to judge the quick and the dead. Upon this the Cardinal having declared, that he in&s;i&s;ted not upon the tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, &s;aid, that in truth we ought to &s;eek Je&s;us Chri&s;t in heaven: but all that he &s;aid &s;hewed forth, that he un|der&s;tood not the matter; and he him&s;elf owned, that he had &s;pent the greate&s;t part of his time upon other bu&s;ine&s;s. De Beze told him, that for certain we do not agree with the Germans upon this third point; but we do agree together, thanks to God, as to the re|jecting of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, and all its con&s;equences; and likewi&s;e, in that we own the true communion of the body and blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Do you own then, &s;ays the Cardinal, that really and &s;ub&s;tantially we do partake of the true body and blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t? That is, an&s;wered De Beze, the fourth point I am to &s;peak of. In a word, he &s;aid, that naturally we receive with our hands, we eat and drink, the vi&s;ible &s;igns; and as to the thing &s;ignified (the body and blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t) it is truly and without fraud offered to every one; but it is, and can be received only &s;piritually, and by faith, not by the hand, or mouth; and neverthele&s;s, this commu|nication is as certain as what we &s;ee with our eyes, and handle with our hands: tho' the my&s;tery of that com|munication, and virtue of the Holy Gho&s;t, and of faith, be incomprehen&s;ible to our under&s;tanding.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 480.</NOTE></P>
<P>At this the Cardinal told the Queen, that he took a great delight in hearing what he heard, and was in great
<PB N="225" REF="244">hopes that the conference would end happily, if it was managed with &s;uch meekne&s;s and &s;trength of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Then the Queen and the company withdrew, and the Cardinal &s;aid very kindly to De Beze, I am very glad that I have &s;een you and talked with you; I ad|jure you in the name of God, that you would confer with me, that I may hear your arguments, and you mine, and you will find that I am not &s;o black as I am repre&s;ented. De Beze thanked him for his civility, be&s;ought him to continue in the &s;ame temper, and of|fered all that was in his power to contribute to &s;uch a holy work. After the&s;e compliments, the Counte&s;s of Cru&s;&s;ol, who was very free, &s;aid, that paper and ink were requi&s;ite, that the Cardinal might &s;ign what he had &s;aid and owned; for, &s;ays &s;he, to-morrow he will &s;ay all the contrary: and &s;he gue&s;&s;ed rightly; for the next day the rumour was &s;pread about the court, that the Cardinal had entirely defeated De Beze; which the Con&s;table having told the Queen, while &s;he &s;at at din|ner, &s;he an&s;wered, that he was ill-informed. However, the &s;ermons began to be more frequent and public in the ca&s;tle of St. Germain, without any tumult, and there was always a great audience of people of all ranks and quality; which was much inerea&s;ed by the Queen of Navarre's arrival, who warmly adhered at that time to the reformed religion.</P>
<P>On the 8th of September the mini&s;ters pre&s;ented a &s;econd petition to the King, the fir&s;t not having been an&s;wered, de&s;iring the &s;ame things they had petitioned for in their former. That petition was tendered to the Queen by De Beze, who &s;poke for the re&s;t. She granted the mini&s;ters, that a deed &s;hould be delivered to them of their petition, whenever occa&s;ion &s;hould re|quire it; but &s;he told them, that for the pre&s;ent &s;uch things were not expedient: be&s;ides which they might take her word, that the prelates &s;hould not be judges in this ca&s;e. When the mini&s;ters were gone out of the Queen's apartment, twelve divines, Sorboni&s;ts, came
<PB N="226" REF="245">in to be&s;eech her Maje&s;ty, that &s;ince the hereties would not acknowledge the prelates for their judges, not to allow them the liberty of di&s;puting; or at lea&s;t, that the di&s;pute &s;hould be only among&s;t them&s;elves, and not before the King and the Princes: becau&s;e, &s;aid they, it would not redound to their edification. In &s;hort, they tried all their endeavours, and left no &s;tone unturned to avoid that conference. But the Queen an&s;wered them, that &s;he did nothing in that re|&s;pect but what had been re&s;olved in the council, after a mature deliberation: &s;o they retired much di&s;content|ed. Very likely they dreaded a &s;ucce&s;s like that of the di&s;putation at Berna, in the year 1528, and felt them|&s;elves too unequal for arguing with the mini&s;ters by the &s;criptures, which they had little &s;tudied.</P>
<P>However, the next day being the 9th of September, at the in&s;tances of Monluc Bi&s;hop of Valence, and Du Val Bi&s;hop of Seez, who very cunningly made u&s;e of the Cardinal of Lorrain to forward that work, the King, with the Queen-mother, the Duke of Orleans, the Prince&s;s Margaret, the Princes of the blood, and the Privy Coun&s;ellors, came to Poi&s;&s;y, and at twelve at noon entered a great hall, dre&s;&s;ed for that purpo&s;e, where he &s;at upon a throne. There were about forty Bi&s;hops and Archbi&s;hops, with their divines, and &s;ix Cardinals, viz. Bourbon, Tourmon, Chatillon, Lor|rain, Armagnac, and Gui&s;e, be&s;ides a great number of nobility, clergy, and gentry.</P>
<P>When the company was &s;at, every one according to his rank and degree, &s;ilence having been commanded, the King opened the conference with the following &s;peech.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>"GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"I have convened you from different places of my kingdom, to receive your advice upon what my Chancellor &s;hall propound to you. I de&s;ire you to put off all pa&s;&s;ion and partiality, that we may reap from this a&s;&s;embly &s;ome good effect, to the quiet of my &s;ubjects,
<PB N="227" REF="246">the glory of God, and the di&s;charge of your con&s;ciences. He told them farther, that they &s;hould not &s;tir out from Poi&s;&s;y, till they had &s;ettled &s;uch good order, by which his &s;ubjects might for the future live together in peace and concord; by doing which, they would en|courage him to keep them under the &s;ame protection as the Kings his predece&s;&s;ors."</P>
<P>Then the Chancellor, by the King's command, &s;poke to this purpo&s;e:</P>
<P>"That the King would have &s;poke more at large, and &s;hewn forth his great affection for religion and govern|ment, and be more often pre&s;ent to their deliberation, after the example of Con&s;tantine the Great, who pre|&s;ided in the Nicene council, if his tender years could allow it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 483.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>All this while the reformed increa&s;ed to &s;uch a num|ber all over the kingdom, that tho' the public exerci&s;e of their religion was forbidden by the edict of July, neverthele&s;s they could not be re&s;trained from it, and in many places they &s;eized upon temples for that purpo&s;e; which gave an occa&s;ion to an edict of the 3d of Novem|ber, by which they were ordered, not only to de&s;i&s;t, but to re&s;tore tho&s;e temples, under pain of death: which edict the reformed obeyed every where at the mini&s;ters in&s;tances.</P>
<P>A few days before that in&s;urrection, a rumour was &s;pread, that the King of Spain, the Pope, and the Catholicks of Germany, had great cor|re&s;pondences in France, and put them&s;elves in a condition to &s;top the progre&s;s of the reformation. The Queen enquired of the Admiral, what forces the re|$ormed of France could rai&s;e, and what a&s;&s;i&s;tance they $ould afford in &s;uch a ca&s;e; and gave him orders un|$er-hand to make &s;uch an inque&s;t as &s;trict as po&s;&s;ible. The Admiral de&s;ired the mini&s;ters and deputies of the $hurches, who were &s;till at Poi&s;&s;y, to write circular $$tters to all the provinces of the kingdom, to require

<P>The edict of Charles IX. about the mo&s;t effectual means to appea&s;e the troubles and &s;editions, in point of religion, of the month of January 1562, publi&s;hed in the parliament of Paris, on the 6th of March of the &s;aid year, was as follows:</P>
<P>"Charles, by the Grace of God, King of France, to all tho&s;e who the&s;e pre&s;ents &s;hall &s;ee, greeting: It is &s;ufficiently known what troubles and &s;editions have been, and are daily kindled, multiplied, and aug|mented, in this kingdom, by the malignancy of the times, and the diver&s;ity of opinions, which reign in religion; and that whatever remedies our predece&s;&s;ors have tried to put a &s;top thereunto, either by the rigour and &s;everity of puni&s;hments, or by mildne&s;s, accord|ing to their u&s;ual and natural benignity and clemency, the thing has penetrated &s;o far into our &s;aid kingdom, and in the minds of our &s;ubjects of all &s;exes, e&s;tates, qualities, and conditions, that we have found our&s;elves in a great perplexity at our acce&s;&s;ion to this crown, to advi&s;e and re&s;olve what means we &s;hould u&s;e to apply good and whole&s;ome remedies thereunto. After long and mature con&s;ultation about the &s;ame with the Queen, our mo&s;t honoured and mo&s;t beloved lady and mother, our mo&s;t dear and mo&s;t beloved uncle the King of Navarre, our Lieutenant, repre&s;enting our per&s;on throughout all our kingdoms and territories, and other Princes of our blood, together with our privy council; we cau&s;ed our &s;aid uncle to a&s;&s;emble in our court of parliament, together with the Princes of our blood, the Peers of France, and other Princes and Lords of our &s;aid privy council.</P>

<P>The reformed were &s;o prodigiou&s;ly increa&s;ed in the kingdom &s;ince Francis II's death, that they reckoned at this time, as above&s;aid, 2150 congregations and up|wards; among&s;t which, &s;everal there were compo&s;ed of four, nay eight thou&s;and communicants, e&s;pecially in the greate&s;t cities; there were no le&s;s than twenty thou|&s;and at Paris.

<P>This progre&s;s of the reformation would have been much greater, had the King of Navarre better under|&s;tood his true concerns, and &s;hewn more &s;teadine&s;s in maintaining them: ma&s;ter of all the forces of the king|dom, as the King's Lieutenant-General, he was able not only to &s;ubdue the Lorrain Princes, and fru&s;trate their factious de&s;igns, but likewi&s;e to right him&s;elf of the King of Spain, and oblige him to re&s;tore to him the kingdom of Navarre. The courts of Madrid and Rome were very &s;en&s;ible of it, therefore they neglected nothing to dazzle that Prince's eyes, and to break the ties which united him to a party which was his only &s;trength, and on which, after God, he might depend entirely: and I do not know what is more to be won|dered at, either his conn&s;ellors and favourites impu|dence, in &s;etting forth Sardinia as one of the fortunate i&s;lands; or that Prince's ignorance and credulity, in believing whatever the&s;e traytors &s;aid unto him? How|ever, that was the &s;ole rea&s;on of the Prince's change, and that was preci&s;ely the rea&s;on why the reformed got not the upper-hand. This is not an invention, but plain matter of fact, grounded upon the te&s;timony of many grave and not &s;u&s;pected hi&s;torians.</P>
<P>And what is more wonderful, the reformation made tho&s;e progre&s;&s;es in le&s;s than forty-two years, without &s;pilling any other blood but that of its profe&s;&s;ors, who were courageous enough to defend the truth at the peril of their own lives. We have &s;een to what degree of fury the per&s;ecution was carried again&s;t them under Francis I. Henry II. and Francis II. in all the pro|vinces of the kingdom, without their having ever thought of freeing them&s;elves from that cruel tyranny by any unlawful means, till the plot of Amboi&s;e, of which they have been charged, nay, which &s;ome Je&s;uits have
<PB N="237" REF="262">endeavoured to render our religion an&s;werable for. But we think we have &s;ufficiently cleared it of that calumnious imputation; &s;hewing forth, fir&s;t, that the plot was not laid again&s;t the King or royal family, but again&s;t the u&s;urper of the government: &s;econdly, that the Catholics, as well as the reformed, were engaged in that plot, which is a convincing proof that religion was not concerned in it: thirdly, that though the re|formed alone &s;hould have been concerned, nay, though it &s;hould be demon&s;trated that the plot was laid again&s;t the King, the reformed religion could be no more charged with it, than the go&s;pel's doctrine can be charged with the vices and crimes which the Chri&s;|tians are addicted to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 628.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The edict of January la&s;t, which had been thought by the wi&s;er &s;ort of people to be a remedy for healing the di&s;ea&s;es of the kingdom, had an effect quite con|trary, and through the malignant humours, which eat up that political body, it occa&s;ioned greater mi&s;chiefs.</P>
<P>The execution of this edict moved great difficulties, e&s;pecially on the part of the Roman Catholics. As to the reformed, though many of them complained of being hard dealt with, becau&s;e they were ordered to go out of the cities for the performance of their religious wor&s;hip; neverthele&s;s, their mini&s;ters and deputies at Paris, having cleared their doubt as to this and &s;ome other points, and wrote to their re&s;pective provinces upon that account, they &s;ubmitted them&s;elves to the King's will<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Laval vol. ii. p. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>During the&s;e debates, the Queen-mother held &s;ome conferences, between Monluc, Bi&s;hop of Valence, Duval, Bi&s;hop of Seez, Des De&s;pence, Bouthelier, and Picherel, and tho&s;e of our mini&s;ters who are &s;till at court, at the head of whom was Beza.</P>
<P>The following propo&s;itions were agreed upon by the Bi&s;hops and the divines, that whereas (according to St.
<PB N="238" REF="263">Au&s;tin) errors were to be plucked out of the minds of men, rather than out of the churches and other places, the Bi&s;hops &s;hould labour by the means of prie&s;ts to in&s;truct the people about the right u&s;e of images, &s;o as to take off all occa&s;ion of offence, the King grant|ing an edict for that purpo&s;e, &s;upported by the church's authority; which, whoever &s;hould oppo&s;e, would be treated as a di&s;turber of the public peace, and di&s;obe|dient to his &s;acred Maje&s;ty's laws.</P>
<P>That the images of the mo&s;t holy Trinity &s;hould be taken away, from the churches and other public places, as forbidden by the holy &s;cripture, the councils and the antient fathers; they having been tolerated only by the connivance, or rather carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of the Bi&s;hops and other pa&s;tors. The &s;ame was agreed upon with re&s;pect to the images of tho&s;e &s;aints, who&s;e names are not recorded in the martyrologies received by the catholic church, and the images drawn in a la&s;civious attire, or repre&s;enting brutes. That no crowns, gar|lands or garments &s;hould be put on them; that no frankincen&s;e &s;hould be burnt, no tapers lighted before them; that they &s;hould not be carried in proce&s;&s;ion; that no vows or offerings &s;hould be made unto them. That they &s;hould not be wor&s;hipped by bowing to, or kneeling before them, becau&s;e all the&s;e things are parts of adoration. That images ought to be removed from the altars, where the cro&s;s only &s;hould remain, and to be affixed in the walls of the churches, in&s;omuch, that for the future, they &s;hould be out of the people's reach, and not be &s;aluted by them, or otherwi&s;e wor|&s;hipped, either by kneeling or ki&s;&s;ing, by vows or of|ferings. That according to a decree of the provincial council of Sens, their &s;hrines &s;hould not be carried about the &s;treets, nor in the churches, as it had been u&s;ual heretofore.</P>
<P>Beza, in his own and his colleague's name, &s;hewed him&s;elf ready to &s;ub&s;cribe to tho&s;e articles, that about the cro&s;s excepted: for, &s;ays he, that cu&s;tom is not of
<PB N="239" REF="264">an older date than Con&s;tantine the Great, whereas the church had no &s;uch u&s;e before; and whereas it might prove of a pernicious con&s;equence (as experience &s;heweth-forth) therefore he could not con&s;ent to it.</P>
<P>But Nicholas Maillard, Dean of the college of Di|vinity, put an end to all manner of conferences upon that point, vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ing what had been con|cluded concerning the u&s;e of images, and &s;trenuou&s;ly maintaining, that they ought not to abate a title of what the Roman church had once authorized, though he owned many things to have been introduced by evil cu&s;tom. And &s;o the clergy in Lewis XIV's time, have ob&s;tinately adhered to the maxim, that they would never con&s;ent to purcha&s;e the return of the re|formed to their communion, at the price of any of the lea&s;t abu&s;es, tolerated by the Roman church. So the conferences ended the 14th of February, without de|ciding the matter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Laval, vol. ii. p. 12.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Before we proceed any further, let us make &s;ome particular remarks on the tran&s;actions of the three la&s;t months, &s;ince the edict was granted on the &s;eventeenth of January, till the coming of the Prince into Orleans, by which we may be able to judge who was the fir&s;t author of the civil war, either the Prince, or the triumvirate.</P>
<P>I. It cannot be denied that, before the Cardinal of Richelieu's mini&s;try, whenever the crown of France was devolved to a Prince, who was not of age for go|verning by him&s;elf, the general &s;tates were convocated for &s;ettling the admini&s;tration of the government du|ring the King's minority, and that &s;uch a &s;ettlement ordered by the general &s;tates, was looked upon as a &s;tanding law, to be in force, and inviolably kept du|ring the &s;aid minority, and till the King was pro|claimed to be of age, with the u&s;ual ceremonies; that is matter of fact, which does not require any further proof. Now becau&s;e the general &s;tates which had been &s;ummoned at Orleans by Francis II. had not as yet
<PB N="240" REF="265">begun their &s;e&s;&s;ions when he died, after &s;ome debates, it was agreed they &s;hould open their &s;e&s;&s;ions; but the circum&s;tances of the times obliged the court to adjourn them till May next at Pointoi&s;e, &s;o they &s;eparated without having done &s;carce any thing el&s;e of moment, be&s;ides the a&s;cribing of the regency to the Queen-mother, and the general-lieutenancy of the kingdom to the King of Navarre. But being a&s;&s;embled again according to their adjournment, they agreed upon the&s;e four articles.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, They confirmed the regency to the Queen-mother, and the general-lieutenancy of the kingdom to the King of Navarre.</P>
<P>Secondly, They excluded from the King's council, all Cardinals, Bi&s;hops, Abbots, and generally all eccle|&s;ia&s;tical per&s;ons, becau&s;e of their oath to the Pope; two brothers could not be admitted into it; and they excluded likewi&s;e tho&s;e who had enjoyed the &s;uperin|tendency of the finances under the former reign, till they had given an account of their admin&s;tration; and tho&s;e who received large donations contrary to the ordinances, till they had made re&s;titution of the &s;ame. This concerned e&s;pecially the Cardinal of Lorrain, the Duke of Gui&s;e, the Mar&s;hal of St. Andrew, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The &s;aid e&s;tates did re&s;erve to them&s;eves, the power of making war, and arming the King's &s;ubjects, during his minority, becau&s;e to them be|longed the cognizance of rea&s;ons for declaring war, whether they were ju&s;t or unju&s;t, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Fourthly, As to religion, they ordered that none for his religion's &s;ake &s;hould be condemned as &s;edi|tious, and a rebel, but it &s;hould be lawful for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects to chu&s;e what of the two religions, the Catholic or the Reformed, they &s;hould like the better; all manner of violence, public or private, was &s;trictly forbidden both to the Catholics and the Re|formed, one again&s;t another. And the Governors and
<PB N="241" REF="266">Magi&s;trates in the &s;everal provinces of the kingdom, were ordered to allow temples to the reformed for their religious wor&s;hip, whither they might re&s;ort freely, and from whence they might come back without any mole&s;tation, all edicts heretofore given to the contrary being made void.</P>
<P>That re&s;olution taken at the general &s;tates &s;erved as a ba&s;is to the edict of January, granted by the Notables, that is, by a &s;elect number of pre&s;idents and coun&s;ellors of all the parliaments of the kingdom, be&s;ides the King's coun&s;el, and &s;everal of the nobility.</P>
<P>But though that very a&s;&s;embly had been &s;ummoned by the Gui&s;es' advice; neverthele&s;s, as the &s;econd and the fourth articles agreed to by the general &s;tates (which lieth heavy upon their hearts, more e&s;pecially the &s;econd) could not be repealed, they re&s;olved to revenge them|&s;elves at any rate, of tho&s;e whom they looked upon as their enemies, we mean the reformed.</P>
<P>II. It mu&s;t be acknowledged, that Princes and Ma|gi&s;trates have a natural right of granting to their &s;ub|jects, what privileges they think proper for &s;ettling peace and tranquillity among&s;t them (provided tho&s;e grants be not of &s;uch a nature, that they &s;ubvert the very fundamental con&s;titution of the government) where it is evident that it cannot be &s;ettled by any other method. This being granted, it follows of cour&s;e, that Charles IX. or his tutors, had a right of granting to his &s;ubjects of the reformed religion, the edict of January, unle&s;s it &s;hould be proved, that &s;uch edict &s;ubverted the very con&s;titution of the kingdom. But in order to prove, that the &s;aid edict was contrary to the fundamental con&s;titution of the government, it is requi&s;ite to prove, that the &s;tate of religion was the &s;ame in France, as to doctrine and wor&s;hip, in the times of Clovis, as in the times of Francis II. and Charles IX. That the wor&s;hipping of images, tran|&s;ub&s;tantiation, the communion under one &s;pecies only, the &s;ervice in an unknown tongue, Corpus Chri&s;ti day,
<PB N="242" REF="267">purgatory (&s;uch as it is believed now in the Roman church) and other &s;uch like &s;tuff, that have been im|po&s;ed upon the people, and were as they are now re|ceived, believed, and practi&s;ed in France in the &s;ix|teenth century, were likewi&s;e received, believed, and practi&s;ed in France in the fifth century; and made any part of the fundamental con&s;titution of the govern|ment, in&s;omuch that the Kings of France were bound by their coronation-oath to keep them inviolable. No &s;uch thing can be made out. It is true, the Kings of France are obliged to protect the church, and main|tain the religion which had been derived unto them from Clovis; and we de&s;ire no better, than that it plea&s;e his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty to perform &s;uch an engagement: for that end, he is obliged to re&s;tore the religion upon the &s;ame footing as it was in Clovis's days, and protect tho&s;e who undertake to re&s;tore the church of God into the lu&s;tre and &s;plendor which &s;he enjoyed in tho&s;e days. Now, if any &s;incere man will be at the trouble of comparing the doctrine, wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline of the reformed, with the doctrine, wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline of the fir&s;t century, he &s;hall find that they are infinitely more agreeable one with another, e&s;pecially in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential points, than is the doc|trine, wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline of the Roman church of tho&s;e days. Therefore, the granting the edict of Ja|nuary was very agreeable to the fundamental con|&s;titution of the realm: it was nothing el&s;e but to ap|prove the Chri&s;tian religion, as it was taught and pro|fe&s;&s;ed in France, in Clovis's time.</P>
<P>III. Whereas, that edict had been granted by the free con&s;ent of the great lords, and mo&s;t notable men in the kingdom, after full and mature con&s;ideration, and without being con&s;trained to do it by any &s;uperior force, except that of <HI>&s;alus populi;</HI> it ought to be kept religiou&s;ly, at lea&s;t till the King &s;hould have been at age, and had maturely and freely debated in his
<PB N="243" REF="268">council, whether it was proper to keep it any longer, or to repeal it.</P>
<P>IV. Is not a &s;ubject bound to &s;ubmit him&s;elf to the King's edicts, though he has not con&s;ented to the framing and publi&s;hing of them; nay, though they have been framed and publi&s;hed again&s;t his private in|clination and opinion? Can he infringe them under any pretence &s;oever, without rendering him&s;elf guilty of high tre$&s;on, and incurring the de&s;erved puni&s;hment? Now the Duke of Guife, and the Cardinal of Lorrain his brother, had con&s;ented, $ay, they had advi&s;ed the Queen to hold the &s;aid a&s;&s;embly of the Notables, in hopes that their re&s;olution would turn to their ac|count, and over-rule that of the general &s;tates; but having not a full certainty of &s;ucceeding when they left the court, they thought it was prudent to have more than one &s;tring for their bow: for tha$ end, they en|tered into a confederacy with foreign Princes, &s;ome of them mortal enemies to the kingdom; and having made them&s;elves &s;ure of the King of Navarre, they undertook to deprive the reformed of the benefit of the King's edicts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See pag. 56.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On Friday the &s;ixth of February 1562, the Janu|arian edict was publi&s;hed and regi&s;tered in the parlia|ment of Thoulou&s;e, without any great relunctancy; and accordingly the mini&s;ter Du Nort qualified him|&s;elf, and took the oath before the Magi&s;trate, as pre|&s;cribed by the edict, and preached without the city; the capitouls and viguier of Thoulou&s;e (they are Ma|gi&s;trates, who&s;e office an&s;wers to that of Alderman and Sheriff, are eight in number, and elected every year) being pre&s;ent. The&s;e beginnings were very quiet; then, by the parliament's orders, the a&s;&s;embly was re|moved to another place, and for teazing the reformed, it was again removed.</P>
<P>But to put a &s;top to the&s;e changes, they built a church at their own charge, large enough to hold eight

Whereat the prie&s;ts, and others concerned in the pre&s;ervation of the Romi&s;h &s;uper&s;titions, were much di&s;plea&s;ed, and began to tam|per with the people. They prevailed &s;o far, that the reformed were abu&s;ed, as they went to, or come back from, their a&s;&s;emblies, and at la&s;t they came to blows. To avoid which, the capitouls and viguier thought proper to accompany the mini&s;ters with their &s;erjeants and archers to hear the &s;ermons; and there is no doubt, but had the parliament been as well-intentioned as the Magi&s;trates, the tranquillity of the city would have been pre&s;erved. But &s;everal members of it po&s;t|poning the public good to their private intere&s;t, and under&s;tanding how the court &s;tood affected, and the practices of the con&s;table, governor of Languedoc, and of the Gui&s;es, for bringing the King of Navarre over to their party, in&s;tead of providing for the public welfare, u&s;ed all their endeavours for ob&s;tructing the ob&s;ervation of the edict, even &s;o far as to relea&s;e &s;ome &s;editious, who had been put in pri&s;on by the capitouls; and every day tho&s;e Magi&s;trates were &s;ummoned to ap|pear, either at the parliament hou&s;e, or at &s;ome of the coun&s;ellors hou&s;es, there to be cen&s;ured and frightened out of their duty.</P>
<P>The prie&s;ts, &s;upported by &s;uch an authority, waited only for an opportunity of rai&s;ing a tumult in the city: at la&s;t they met with it at the funeral of a reformed woman, who being carried to the grave with a very &s;mall attendance, according to her de&s;ire, the prie&s;ts took the corp&s;e in order to bury it after the Roman church's way, and cau&s;ed the bells to ring in order to rai&s;e the people in arms. They were &s;o well obeyed, that the Catholics came from all quarters, and fell upon the reformed wherever they met with them, with &s;tones and &s;words, wounded many, and killed &s;ome of them. The news of this in&s;urrection having been brought
<PB N="245" REF="270">before the parliament, they &s;ent two coun&s;ellors to in|quire about the matter, and endeavour by all means to pacify every thing: in&s;tead of which, as they were of the &s;editious party, they kindled anew the fire, which was almo&s;t quenched, exhorting that frantic multitude of prie&s;ts, and rude mob, to kill all the Huguenots, and giving them licence for plundering their hou&s;es; telling them further, that the parliament ordered it &s;o. The rabble, incited by tho&s;e grave &s;enators exhortations, ru&s;hed into the hou&s;es of the re|formed, and plundered whatever they could find; whereupon the reformed, frightened, ran in arms to the town-hou&s;e, imploring the protection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the capitouls again&s;t the violence offered to them. The capitouls &s;ent for the captain of the watch, and ordered him to &s;uppre&s;s that fury of the rabble, le&s;t &s;omething wor&s;e &s;hould happen. He being accom|panied by his &s;atellites, and &s;ome &s;tudents of the uni|ver&s;ity, who joined with them, ru&s;hed in upon the &s;aid rabble, and put them to flight: neverthele&s;s the peo|ple flocking again from every part of the city, the tumult was renewed, and la&s;ted till night.</P>
<P>The next day, &s;ome of the &s;enators met with the capitouls and &s;ome coun&s;ellors, advocates, and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable among&s;t the citizens, and con&s;ulted together about the propere&s;t means of appea&s;ing the tumult, le&s;t it &s;hould break out in an open &s;edition. After &s;ome debates they agreed, that the reformed &s;hould have the free exerci&s;e of their religion in the &s;uburbs, according to the edict; and that the capitouls &s;hould be pre&s;ent in their church, with a guard of one hundred men, armed with all &s;orts of arms, arquebu&s;&s;es and pi&s;tols excepted; and for the good behaviour of the&s;e men, the reformed &s;hould enter caution: that the Catholics &s;hould keep likewi&s;e two hundred men at their own charge for the city guard, and &s;hould enter caution for them: that the prie&s;ts &s;hould be forbidden to ring the alarm-bell for exciting the people to take
<PB N="246" REF="271">up arms, and if they did it, and were apprehended, they &s;hould be burnt alive: that all &s;oldiers and va|grants, who had neither domicil or ma&s;ter in the city, &s;hould leave it in twenty-four hours: that the capi|touls, together with the &s;ene&s;chal, &s;hould judge, with|out appeal, of all mann$r of &s;edi$$on: that the citizens, war$ by ward, &s;hould guard the city-gates.</P>
<P>The&s;e articles were wi&s;ely agreed upon, and publi&s;h|ed in all the &s;treets, but without effect; for the prie&s;ts filled up the churches and cloi&s;ters with arms and &s;ol|diers, the Catholic citizens: &s;ome pre&s;idents and coun|&s;ellors of the parliament cau&s;ed gun powder and other ammunition to be brought into the city. On the other hand, the reformed &s;eeing all the&s;e military prepara|tions, and frightened by the ma&s;&s;acre lately perpetrated at Cahors, and by the in&s;urrection of the Catholics again&s;t them at Ca&s;telnau d'Arry, thought proper to put them&s;elves in a po&s;ture of defence: b$ $he Catho|lics (fearing le&s;t the reformed, being once $$&s;ters of the city, would not &s;pare their old &s;uper&s;titious &s;tocks) were grown very audacious aga$n&s;t them, encouraged to it by the example of other cities, e&s;pecially tho&s;e two ju&s;t mentioned; and it happened that the reformed, thro' the imprudence and over ha&s;tine&s;s of &s;ome a|mong&s;t them, e&s;pecially of Barrelles, one of the mini|&s;ters, hurried them&s;elves along to the greate&s;t cala|mities.</P>
<P>A few days before, Peter Hunault, Lord of Lanta, one of the capitouls, coming from court, had had a conference with the Prince at Orleans, to whom he had promi&s;ed to deliver the city at lea&s;t he was charged with the fact, by letters &s;ent to Montluc, at Faudouas, from Mon&s;ieur la Roque des Arts). Mont|luc, under&s;tanding this, &s;ent the&s;e letters by an expre&s;s to Ma&s;eural, Fir&s;t Pre&s;ident of Thoulou&s;e, with one of his own, whereby he let him know, what orders he had given for the relief of the city, and what they
<PB N="247" REF="272">were to do for receiving that relief, and for enabling them&s;elves to with&s;tand their enemies.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident thought proper to read the&s;e letters in full parliament; the contents whereof having been ex|amined, they decreed to arre&s;t the &s;aid Lord of Lanta, who retired to a country-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Now the reformed having publi&s;hed, on the 10th of May, a &s;acrament day for the next Sunday, and Bar|relles having preached a &s;editious &s;ermon, the next day three of the capitouls were &s;ent for by the parliament, and ordered to receive in the town-hou&s;e four compa|nies of foot; furthermore, to cau&s;e all the foreigners of the reformed religion to avoid the city, and to in|hibit the celebration of the Lord's &s;upper. The&s;e things being come to the notice of the reformed, they met to con&s;ult together on their pre&s;ent circum&s;tances: but the opinions were divided; the wi&s;e&s;t were for re|maining &s;till and quiet; but others, not con&s;idering the con&s;equences, were for making u&s;e of violent means: &s;o they parted, without taking unanimou&s;ly any re&s;o|lution. But after &s;upper, Barrelles, a courageous and zealous man, but very incon&s;iderate and hot-headed, and who was not always directed in his doings by the &s;pirit of God, per&s;uaded tho&s;e of his faction to &s;eize upon the town-hou&s;e that very night, becau&s;e their ad|ver&s;aries were to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it next morning. Therefore Captain Saux, having taken upon him the exe|cution of that enterpri&s;e, went thither with &s;everal &s;ol|diers, Ga&s;coons, well armed, and, without any noi&s;e, he knocked at the door, which was opened by the capi|touls, and entered with his men, and taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame, wherein they found a va&s;t quantity of arms, and &s;everal canons: he &s;eized likewi&s;e upon three col|leges in the neighbourhood, without any &s;hedding of blood: then he cau&s;ed &s;everal tons full of earth to be laid down cro&s;s the adjacent &s;treets.</P>
<P>The parliament, exa&s;perated at this audaciou&s;ne&s;s, &s;ent notice of it to Montluc, and to all the nobility of
<PB N="248" REF="273">the country, intreating them to &s;end with all &s;peed what troops they could afford; that the town-hou&s;e, and other &s;trong places in the city, had been &s;eized upon by the Huguenots; that they intended to pro|claim the Prince of Conde King of France, and to murder all the Catholics, even children of &s;even years old; that it was full time to oppo&s;e their perfidiou&s;|ne&s;s, and their barbarous cruelty. They wrote like|wi&s;e to the neighbouring towns, and incited the pea|&s;ants of the adjacent country, bidding them, in the King's name, to ri&s;e in arms, and fall upon all the re|formed they could meet with, and kill them; then come to Thoulou&s;e to have their &s;hare of the &s;poils. The pre&s;idents and coun&s;ellors of the parliament, habited in their &s;carlet gowns, with their arms over, were running thro' the &s;treets like madmen, proclaiming by a trumpet, that they deemed the Huguenots to be enemies to God, and traitors to the King; therefore it was allowed to every one to treat them as &s;uch: or|dering the Catholics to wear a white cro&s;s over their coats, that they might be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the others, and to put the &s;ame mark upon the po&s;ts of their doors, without which their hou&s;es might be expo&s;ed to plunder. Mean while the reformed, who had &s;eiz|ed upon the town-hou&s;e, &s;tirred not for all the&s;e awful proclamations, endeavouring to appea&s;e the tumult, and to come to an agreement with their enemies upon &s;ome rea&s;onable terms, by the capitoul's means; but no &s;uch thing could be done: tho&s;e of the parliament, who de&s;ired no better than to &s;ee the utter de&s;truction of the reformed, oppo&s;ing all ways and means of a reconciliation.</P>
<P>Now, whereas they had proclaimed in the &s;treets, that whoever &s;hould kill the Huguenots, or plunder their hou&s;es, &s;hould not be accountable for it: upon &s;uch an encouragement, the furious mob ru&s;hed into the hou&s;es of the reformed, or tho&s;e whom they &s;u&s;|pected to countenance them, and plundered them;
<PB N="249" REF="274">they fell upon them, and murdered, drowned, or otherwi&s;e put to death, a great number; and it was deemed a piece of clemency in them, when they were &s;atisfied with ca&s;ting them into dark dungeons, loaded with irons, after they had been unmercifully beaten.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of the reformed, who were in arms, &s;eeing that there was no hopes left of coming to an agree|ment, rai&s;ed in ha&s;te &s;ome works in nine different places of the city, for the guard of the &s;treets, where|by the enemy mu&s;t pa&s;s to come to the town-hou&s;e. On the other hand, the Catholics fortified the towers of the churches, and the loftie&s;t hou&s;es of the citizens; and whereas they had the greate&s;t number of troops, and &s;everal captains of note to command them (they were no le&s;s than 8000, reckoning the auxiliaries &s;ent by Montluc) they a&s;&s;aulted frequently the re|formed at tho&s;e places wherein they had fortified them|&s;elves, but they were always wor&s;ted. This conflict la&s;ted four days, the reformed never giving place, tho' they were far inferior in number to their enemies; but when they heard of Montluc's coming with more troops, as they were in great want of gun-powder, and other ammunition, and that they expected no a&s;&s;i&s;tance, having accepted of the terms propo&s;ed to them by their enemies, they re&s;olved to depart the city: accordingly, having left the arms they had found in the town-hou&s;e, mo&s;t part of them went out upon a Sunday, the 17th of May, being Whit&s;untide, after having received the &s;acrament. But many were &s;lain upon the roads by the pea&s;ants and the gentry, who guarded the pa&s;&s;ages, and their bodies left to be de|voured by wolves and dogs: tho&s;e, who could e&s;cape, were received at Montauban, Ca&s;tres, Lavaur, and Puy-Laurens. It is reckoned by Beza and Dinoth, that four thou&s;and, of both &s;ides, lo&s;t their lives in the &s;everal &s;kirmi&s;hes during the&s;e four days; tho' Thuanus

<P>The famous colloquium of Poi&s;&s;y was held during the minority of Charles IX. by order of Catherine de Medicis, his mother, and regent of the kingdom. Calvin was not pre&s;ent at the colloquium: but Theo|dorus Beza, who was always much e&s;teemed for his learning, and was a principal di&s;ciple of Calvin, well &s;killed in the tenets embraced by him, and the ar|guments on which they were be&s;t &s;upported, was therefore looked upon as a very proper per&s;on to ap|pear there in behalf of the Prote&s;tants, e&s;pecially as he had before oppo&s;ed the Cardinal, Charles of Lorrain, Archbi&s;hop of Reims.</P>
<P>Beza pre&s;ented<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bo&s;&s;uet, vol. ii. p. 60.</NOTE>, at this very augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly, in the name of all the churches, the common confe&s;&s;ion of faith, which he then likewi&s;e undertook the defence of: and having wrote in one of his books, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t was not more in the <HI>Bene</HI> than in the dirt, he explained him&s;elf with more decency and propriety; urging, that in re&s;pect to the place of re&s;idence or pre|&s;ence of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, con&s;idered after his a&s;cen&s;ion, his body was as far removed from the <HI>Bene,</HI> as heaven is above the earth, which was all intended by his phra&s;e <HI>Caena quam in Coeno.</HI></P>
<P>The fourth national &s;ynod of the reformed churches was held at Lyons, in 1563; the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ions where|of begun on the 10th of Augu&s;t, Peter Viret, then mini&s;ter of Lyons, being moderator, wherein nothing material was tran&s;acted, be&s;ides what concerned the di&s;cipline. Cen&s;ures were decreed again&s;t mini&s;ters contracting unfitting marriages, either as to the age, or as to the condition, or the morals of the bride: it was ordered, that marriages &s;hould be celebrated in the church; and in ca&s;e one of the parties &s;hould be di&s;abled, either by &s;ickne&s;s or otherwi&s;e, to walk to

<P>Several regulations were made, &s;everal ca&s;es of con|&s;cience were decided, and &s;everal queries about that an&s;wered; and whether they were not too &s;evere, or whether they &s;tretched not their authority too far, that I do not take upon me to determine. For example, a man who for&s;akes his wife afflicted with the lepro&s;y, and marries another, this &s;econd marriage is declared void, and the man is excommunicated till he comes again with his fir&s;t wife, and has done public penance. All promi&s;es of marriage, made between parties of a competent age, and with the con&s;ent of their parents, are declared indi&s;&s;oluble, tho' the marriage has not been &s;olemnized, nor even the banns publi&s;hed, nay, tho' both parties &s;hould unanimou&s;ly con&s;ent to their &s;eparation.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ters of Geneva, con&s;ulted upon that point, were of opinion, ha$$he promi&s;e is &s;acred and irrevocable; an$, even tho' the parents &s;hould oppo&s;e, the parties con|cerned are in con&s;cience, and by the laws of God, obliged to go on, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e oppo&s;itions, &amp;c.</P>

<P>In 1566 great oppo&s;itions were made to the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the Inqui&s;ition; and the pride, haughtine&s;s, and exceeding cruelties of the Inqui&s;itors, brought matters to almo&s;t a general confu&s;ion. The cities of Flanders in|&s;i&s;ted, two or three times, with the Governe&s;s, and &s;hewed forth, that what was required of them was quite con|trary to their privileges and liberties; that the Inqui&s;ition had never been admitted, either by the general &s;tates, or by the four members; and that they de&s;ired that it &s;hould be aboli&s;hed, at lea&s;t as to the authority which it had u&s;urped over the laymen. Their remon&s;trances having not the de&s;ired effect, they pre&s;ented another petition; but no greater regard was paid to it, only orders were &s;ent to the Inqui&s;itor at Bruges, not to proceed in his pur&s;uits again&s;t the reformed in that city till new orders from the King.</P>
<P>And in this year the reformed of the Low Countries printed again their confe&s;&s;ion of faith, which they de|dicated to the King, and made their apology as to the crimes laid to their charge.</P>
<P>The dread of the Inqui&s;ition had &s;o much &s;eized upon every one, that the chief nobility made a league between them&s;elves for hindering its e&s;tabli&s;hment. The more zealous Catholics were admitted into it as well as others. That could not be done &s;o &s;ecretly, but the Governe&s;s had &s;ome hint of it; and whereas
<PB N="253" REF="278">fame magnifies ordinarily the objects, that Prince&s;s was told that the league was already more than fifteen thou&s;and men &s;trong, who were all ready to revenge them&s;elves upon the provinces, if liberty of con&s;cience was not allowed. At this news, the Governe&s;s being frightened, &s;he &s;ummoned the Knights of the Golden Fleece, and the Stadtholders of the Provinces; and above all &s;he invited, in a very obliging manner, the Prince of Orange and Count of Horn, who had retired from court, to be pre&s;ent at that a&s;&s;embly. Every member voted for <HI>mildne&s;s</HI> and for <HI>liberty.</HI> The Go|verne&s;s, who was better acquainted than any body el&s;e with her brother Philip's intentions, knew very well that the only way to plea&s;e him, was to make u&s;e of the mo&s;t violent methods. But what could &s;he do? She was obliged by her circum&s;tances either to yield, or to take up arms; but, in the la&s;t ca&s;e, to whom could &s;he give the command of the army? She mi&s;tru&s;t|ed the Prince of Orange; and the Count of Egmont, being &s;olicited to take that charge upon him, an&s;wered, "That he would never fight for the penal laws and the Inqui&s;ition."</P>
<P>It was while that a&s;&s;embly was upon deliberating what to do, that the confederates arrived in numbers at Bru&s;&s;els, and pre&s;ented their petition to the Gover|ne&s;s, whereby they required chiefly, that the Inqui&s;i|tion's proceedings &s;hould be &s;uper&s;eded, till the King had an&s;wered their petition.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t the Governe&s;s an&s;wered in a way too general, wherewith they were not at all &s;atisfied; and at la&s;t &s;he was obliged to promi&s;e, that the Inqui&s;itors would pro|ceed for the future with all po&s;&s;ible lenity in religious affairs, the ca&s;es of tumult and &s;edition being excepted, and that even in &s;uch ca&s;es nothing could be done with|out the court's advice. She promi&s;ed further, to &s;end their petition to the King, backed with proper repre|&s;entations from her, upon the matter.</P>
<PB N="254" REF="279">
<P>Whereupon the nobility were more ea&s;y, and re&s;ol|ved to &s;eparate them&s;elves; but they took proper mea|&s;ures for &s;ecuring to them&s;elves the advantages they had procured. They named for that purpo&s;e four per&s;ons of their body, to whom they tru&s;ted the general direc|tion of their affairs. They named three or four more in each province, who were to give notice of every thing to the Director General, and to execute the orders they &s;hould receive from them; and they charged them all with the care of preventing all popular in&s;ur|rections, and of pre&s;&s;ing the performance of what had been promi&s;ed unto them. La&s;tly, they engaged them|&s;elves to alter nothing in the government, civil or ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical, till the King had ordered it in the a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates.</P>
<P>Tho' many of the fir&s;t nobility were in the confede|rates company, when they pre&s;ented the &s;aid petition to the Governe&s;s, that hindered not the Count of Barle|mont to call them beggars, when, willing to remove the fears which the Governe&s;s had of them, he told her, "What do you fear, Madam, from the&s;e beg|gars?" The confederated nobility gloried in that title: it &s;erved as a mark of di&s;tinction, for animating the party by the re&s;entment of the injury. They cau&s;ed &s;everal medals to be &s;tampt, which they hung on their necks: on one &s;ide whereof the King's effigy was to be &s;een; and on the rever&s;e, was a bag with this motto, "Faithful to the King, even to beggary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Laval, vol. iii. p. 139.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>A new edict again&s;t the Lutherans was publi&s;hed at this time, confirming that of the fourteenth of October 1529, with this further clau&s;e: That no body &s;hould attempt to write or print, or cau&s;e to write or print, any new book, upon whatever &s;ubject &s;oever, without having obtained letters of licence, upon pain of being pilloried; and be&s;ides that of being branded in the forehead with a hot iron, or of having one of his eyes plucked out, or one of his hands cut off, at the di&s;|cretion
<PB N="255" REF="280">of the judge, who ought to execute that &s;en|tence without any delay, and without any mercy.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time nine were taken out of their beds at Am&s;terdam, and brought to the Hague, where they were beheaded by the Emperor's command, be|ing &s;u&s;pected of Anabapti&s;m.</P>
<P>What has been before narrated is &s;ufficient to &s;hew the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of the reformation in France till the year 1566; and as there will be an account of Eng|land's intere&s;ting it&s;elf in the cau&s;e of the Huguenots, as well before Henry IV. granted the edict of Nantz, on April 30, 1598, as after the revocation thereof on October 22, 1685, frequent opportunities of men|tioning the mo&s;t material incidents relating to them, we &s;hall conclude this chapter with an account of the re|peal of that famous decree.</P>
<P>Lewis XIV. King of France, animated by bigotted and cruel prie&s;ts and confe&s;&s;ors, notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t ardent and moving remon&s;trances that could be made by the friends of Prote&s;tanti&s;m, repealed the edict of Nantz, and cruelly per&s;ecuted the Prote&s;tants.</P>
<P>The relation of this matter is briefly cited in Bi&s;hop Burnet's hi&s;tory of his own times, and from his own knowledge and ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, M. de Louvoy, &s;eeing the King re&s;olutely bent upon the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the Prote&s;tants, propo&s;ed to him a method, which he believed would &s;horten the work, and do it effectually; which was, to let loo&s;e &s;ome bodies of dragoons to live upon the Prote&s;tants at di&s;cretion, and they were put under no other re|&s;traints but only to avoid rapes, and the killing of them. This was begun in Bearn; and the people were &s;o &s;truck with it, that &s;eeing they were to be eat up fir&s;t, and if that prevailed not, to be ca&s;t into pri&s;on till they &s;hould change, and being required only to promi&s;e that they would reunite them&s;elves to the church, they, overcome with fear, and having no time for con&s;ulting together, did univer&s;ally comply.

<HEAD>RICHARD II. <HI>&s;urnamed of</HI> Bourdeaux, A.D. 1377.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Richard II. upon the demi&s;e of his grandfather, Edward III. June 21, 1377, &s;ucceeded to the throne, he found him&s;elf involved in a war with France, and on a precarious footing with Scotland. Neverthele&s;s, the internal peace of the kingdom was uninterrupted till the year 1381<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. iv. p. 93.</NOTE>, when a poll-tax of three groats upon every per&s;on above fifteen years of age, impo&s;ed by parliament, occa&s;ioned an in&s;urrection of upwards of 100,000 plebeians, headed by Wat Tyler, Jack Straw, and others; which however was &s;oon quelled, but not till the in&s;urgents had committed horrid outrages.</P>
<P>A. D. 1382.] His Maje&s;ty, having the preceding year contracted marriage with Anne, &s;i&s;ter of the Emperor Wince&s;laus, was induced by his brother in|law to adopt the cau&s;e of Pope Urban VI. again&s;t his rival Pope Clement VII. who therefore preached up a cru&s;ade again&s;t the King of England<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 107.</NOTE>, while Urban authori&s;ed Henry Spencer, Bi&s;hop of Norwich, to un|dertake a like attempt again&s;t Charles VI. of France. That prelate, accordingly, made an expedition into Flanders; but the &s;ucce&s;s was not equal to his martial
<PB N="259" REF="286">genius. By that time the King was governed by &s;y|cophant mini&s;ters: and be&s;ides the mi&s;carriage in Flanders<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. iv. p. 122&mdash;128.</NOTE>, the Engli&s;h lo&s;t ground in France, and their arms were unfortunate again&s;t Scotland, and in Ca&s;tile in behalf of the Duke of Lanca&s;ter, during who&s;e re&s;idence in that country, the French equipped a mighty armament for the inva&s;ion of England, but a violent tempe&s;t fru&s;trated their intention, in 1386. The King, when that danger was over, &s;till continu|ing to be guided by his minions, who employed judges to give &s;anction to their arbitrary proceedings<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 140.</NOTE>, &s;e|veral noblemen repre&s;ented the bad tendency of &s;uch mea&s;ures, and perceiving the remon&s;trances ineffectual, had recour&s;e to arms<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 142.</NOTE>, and defeated Robert de Vere, Duke of Ireland, at Radcot-bridge.</P>
<P>A. D. 1388]. After that di&s;a&s;ter, Richard complied, in parliament, with the demands of the confederate lords<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 145.</NOTE>; impeachments were exhibited again&s;t his mi|ni&s;ters; the judges were bani&s;hed to Ireland; divers per&s;ons of di&s;tinction put to death; and Alexander Nevil, Archbi&s;hop of York, being one of the obnoxious courtiers, was deprived of his &s;ee, but by Pope Urban nominated to that of St. Andrew's; which tran&s;la|tion<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 152.</NOTE>, however, did not take place, as the Scots ac|knowledged Pope Clement, and Nevil retiring to Flan|ders, &s;erved there a &s;mall cure the remainder of his life. Before this parliament (denominated the <HI>merci|le&s;s</HI>) broke up, the King renewed his coronation-oath, and the two hou&s;es their homage and fealty. In another parliament convened in October, at Cambridge, there were &s;ome regulations made to redre&s;s the grievance of going to Rome for benefices. The other remarkable occurrences of this year were<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 157.</NOTE>, the Earl of Arundel's expedition to Brittany, the de&s;cent of the Scots upon Ireland and the I&s;le of Man; and the battle of Otter|burn,

<P>A. D. 139$.] The &s;chi&s;m of the church &s;till con|tinuing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. iv. p. 164.</NOTE>, Boniface IX. who had been elected on the death of Urban, &s;ent a nuncio to England to &s;olicit a repeal of the &s;tature of provi&s;ors, and other laws again&s;t the papal encroachments, as well as for preventing a peace between Richard and Charles of France, who &s;upported Pope Benedict XIII. the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Cle|ment: but the parliament rejected his propo&s;als; and in that which met in January 1393, the famous &s;ta|tute of <HI>praemunire</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 166.</NOTE> was enacted again&s;t all who pur|cha&s;ed or &s;olicited in the court of Rome, or el&s;e|where, any tran&s;lation of Bi&s;hops, proce&s;&s;es and &s;en|tences of excommunication, bulls, in&s;truments, or any thing el&s;e to the prejudice of the King, his crown, royalty, or kingdom.</P>
<P>A parliament meeting in the beginning of the year 1395, the Pope's nuncio made another application for a repeal for the &s;tatute again&s;t provi&s;ors, and with the like bad &s;ucce&s;s<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 176.</NOTE>. The Wickliffites al&s;o pre&s;ented a re|mon&s;trance to that a&s;&s;embly, impeaching the morals and doctrines of the clergy: but the Abp of York, and the Bi&s;hop of London, repre&s;ented them to Richard (then in Ireland) in &s;uch a light, that, upon his return, they were expo&s;ed to great hard&s;hips. Richard, though he had reformed &s;ome errors in government, &s;ince he a&s;&s;umed the reins into his own hands in 1389, yet his levity and extravagance &s;till afforded cau&s;e of murmur; and one Haxey, a clergyman, upon a motion for a &s;ub&s;idy, in the parliament which met in January 1397<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 184.</NOTE>, brought a bill into the hou&s;e of commons, complaining of the exce&s;&s;ive number of prelates, ladies, and idle dependants, maintained at court, and petition|ing that the charges of the hou&s;hold might be re|trenched. Haxey was tried and condemned by the
<PB N="261" REF="288">Lords; but at the interce&s;&s;ion of the Bi&s;hops his life was &s;pared. In a &s;ub&s;equent parliament, which met in September this year, the clergy were indulged with having a Proctor at &s;uch trials where they did not chu&s;e to &s;it per&s;onally<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. iv. p. 191.</NOTE>: and Thomas Arundel, who had been tran&s;lated from the archi-epi&s;copal chair of York to Canterbury, was convicted of high trea&s;on, and condemned to perpetual exile. Richard Fitz-Alan, Earl of Arundel, &s;uffered decapitation for the &s;ame crime; of which Thomas Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, was al&s;o found guilty, but his &s;en|tence was changed into confinement in the I&s;le of Man; and the King's uncle, Thomas Duke of Glou|ce&s;ter, who had been lately murdered at Calais, was declared a traitor by this complai&s;ant parliament; which meeting again by adjournment in January 1398, at Shrew&s;bury<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 197.</NOTE>, rever&s;ed the proceedings of the parliament of 1382, annulled &s;ome forfeitures made in the two preceding reigns, and delegated the power of tran&s;acting bu&s;ine&s;s, during their rece&s;s, to a committee of eighteen of their own members.</P>
<P>A. D. 1399.] Richard's admini&s;tration gave &s;uch general di&s;content, that the nation was ripe for revolt; and the King being then in Ireland, Henry of Lan|ca&s;ter, Duke of Hereford, who had been arbitrarily bani&s;hed to France, was invited to head the oppo&s;i|tion<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 204&mdash;222.</NOTE>. Henry landing, with the depo&s;ed Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and a few others, was in a &s;hort time at the head of a numerous army, while the King's troops dimini&s;hed daily; and having made that Prince captive &s;oon after his arrival from Ireland, convened, in September, a parliament, which dethroned Richard, and acknowledged Lanca&s;ter &s;overeign, by the name of Henry IV.</P>
<PB N="262" REF="289">
<P>In the year 1377, King Richard II. called a par|liament at We&s;tmin&s;ter, where the laity moved that no officer of the holy church &s;hould take pecuniary &s;ums, more or le&s;s, of the people for the correction of &s;ins<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Church Hi&s;tory, p. 115.</NOTE>; but only enjoin them &s;piritual penance, which would be more plea&s;ing to God, and pro&s;itable to the &s;oul of the offender. The clergy &s;tickled hereat; for by this craft they got their gain: but here the King interpo&s;ed, that prelates &s;hould proceed herein as for|merly, according to the laws of the holy church, and not otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>In this parliament a &s;tatute was enacted in favour of the clergy, empowering them to bring actions of tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t purveyors who &s;hould give them di&s;|turbance, and entitling them to treble damages; ex|empting them from indictments and impri&s;onment, for holding pleas in the &s;piritual court<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Smollet's Hi&s;tory of the Church, vol. v. p. 202.</NOTE>; and &s;ubjecting to impri&s;onment, and payment of damages, any mi|ni&s;ter of the King, or other per&s;on, who &s;hould arre&s;t or interrupt a clergyman in the exerci&s;e of his function.</P>
<P>In the parliament held at Glouce&s;ter in 1378, the Commons complained that many clergymen<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Church Hi&s;tory, p. 115.</NOTE>, under the notion of <HI>&s;ylva caedua</HI> (lopwood) took tithes even of timber it&s;elf; reque&s;ting, that, in &s;uch ca&s;es, pro|hibition might be granted to the proceedings of court Chri&s;tian; but this took no effect. Then the Arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury inveighed, as bitterly, of the franchi&s;es infringed of the abbey-church of We&s;tmin|&s;ter; wherein Robert de Hanley, E&s;quire, with a &s;er|vant of that church, were both horribly &s;lain therein, at the high altar, even when the prie&s;t was &s;inging of ma&s;s; and pathetically de&s;ired reparation for the &s;ame. Complaints were al&s;o made again&s;t the extortion of Bi&s;hops clerks; to which (as to other abu&s;es) &s;ome general reformation was promi&s;ed.</P>
<PB N="263" REF="290">
<P>In the next parliament called at We&s;tmin&s;ter, one of the greate&s;t grievances of the land was redre&s;&s;ed, namely, foreigners holding of eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices; for many Italians had the be&s;t livings in England collated on them by the Pope; yea, many great Cardi|nals, re&s;ident at Rome, were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the be&s;t pre|bends and par&s;onages in the land, who generally farmed out their places to Proctors, their own coun|trymen; and by this means the wealth of the land leaked out into foreign countries, to the great impo|veri&s;hing of this land. Therefore the King and par|liament now enacted, that no aliens &s;hould hereafter hold any &s;uch preferments, nor any &s;end over unto them the revenues of &s;uch benefices. About this time, William Courteney &s;ucceeded to the &s;ee of Can|terbury, and celebrated the King's marriage, without having the pall from Rome, which he looked upon as a ceremony, that did not at all effect the rights of his metropolitan function.</P>
<P>In 1381, bur&s;t forth the dangerous rebellion of Wat Tyler and Jack Straw, with thou&s;ands of their wicked company, who burnt the Savoy, the Duke of Lanca&s;ter's hou&s;e; from the Savoy they went to the Temple, where they burnt the lawyers lodgings, with their books and writings: al&s;o the hou&s;e of St. John's by Smithfield, they &s;et on fire, which burnt for &s;even days together. Then came they to the Tower (where the King was lodged) which they entered, and hading there Simon Sudbury, Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and Lord Chancellor, and Sir Robert Hales, Lord Trea&s;urer, they led th$m to the Tower Hill, and there in a mo&s;t cruel manner &s;truck off their heads, as al&s;o of divers others. Neither &s;p$red they the &s;acred places; for breaking into the church of the Augu&s;tin friars, they drew forth thirteen Flemings, and be|headed them in the open &s;treets, as allo &s;eventeen others out of other churches. They committed outrages afterwards at St. Alban's, cancelling the antient
<PB N="264" REF="291">charters of the abbots and monks there. At the &s;ame time they were gathered together in Suffolk, to the number of fifty thou&s;and, by the in&s;tigation of one John Wraw, a low prie&s;t. The&s;e de&s;troyed the hou&s;es of the lawyers; they beheaded Sir John Ca|vendi&s;h, the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice of England, and &s;et his head upon the pillory in St. Edmund's Bury. Then Henry Spencer, the valiant Bi&s;hop of Norwich, gathered together a great number of armed men, with whom he &s;et upon the rebels, di&s;comfited them, and took John Litte&s;ter, and their other chieftains, whom he cau&s;ed al&s;o to be executed; and by this means the country was quieted. Jack Straw, John Ki$by, Alane Tredder, and John Sterling, lo&s;t their heads. Wat Tyler, while lifting up his dagger, as if he intended to plunge it in the bo&s;om of his &s;overeign, was &s;tunned by Sir William Walworth, Lord Mayor of London, by a blow of his mace, and then Sir John Philpot made him tumble from his hor&s;e, by thru&s;ting his &s;word through his body. The&s;e had to their chaplain a wicked prie&s;t, called John Ball, who coun&s;elled them to de&s;troy all the nobility and clergy, &s;o that there &s;hould be no Bi&s;hop in England but one Archbi&s;hop, which &s;hould be him&s;elf; and that there &s;hould not be above two religious per&s;ons in one hou&s;e, and their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions &s;hould be divided among the lay-men; for the which doctrine they held him a prophet; but he was executed at St. Alban's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. iv. p. 97.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On July 13, 1382, the King i&s;&s;ued a writ to the Chancellor and Proctors of the Univer&s;ity of Oxford, to expel all graduates &s;u&s;pected of favouring Wickliffe's tenets, unle&s;s they would purge them&s;elves before the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. They were likewi&s;e or|dered to &s;earch for all books written by Wickliffe or Hereford, and tran&s;mit them to the Archbi&s;hop with|out alteration. This order was executed by Doctor Rigge, who was by this time Chancellor, although
<PB N="265" REF="292">he him&s;elf was &s;uppo&s;ed to favour Wickliffe: yet no violence was offered to the per&s;on of this reformer, who lived unmole&s;ted at his living of Lutterworth in Leice&s;ter&s;hire, where be &s;oon after this period died of the pal&s;y; nor were the Lollards much troubled in the &s;equel of this reign, except by &s;ome writs for &s;eizing their books, di&s;per&s;ing their conventicles, and impri|&s;oning their teachers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet's Hi&s;tory of the Church, vol. v. p. 204.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A. D. 1388.] The government &s;eemed now to be more upon its guard again&s;t the encroachments of Rome; for the King obliged the Pope's collector to take an oath that he would be true to the King and crown; that he would do nothing detrimental to the royal pre|rogative or laws of the kingdom; that he would not publi&s;h any letters from the Pope, without the per|mi&s;&s;ion of the King's council; that he would not ex|port money or plate from the kingdom, nor introduce any new cu&s;toms, without the King's knowledge and particular licence. At the &s;ame time a writ was directed by the King to the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, re|minding him of his duty, to prevent all illegal impo|&s;itions on the &s;ubjects; informing him of the exactions of Rome; the re&s;olution of the Commons to hold tho&s;e per&s;ons guilty of high trea&s;on, who &s;hould bring in papal bulls, or levy impo&s;itions in favour of the Pope. Writs of the &s;ame nature were directed to the other prelates, forbidding them to allow the levy of a tenth, which the Pope impo&s;ed upon the clergy; and D$r|den the Pope's nuncio was prohibited from collecting it, on pain of forfeiting life and limb. Notwith&s;tand|ing the&s;e precautions, a great number of clergymen ventured to di&s;regard the King's injunctions, and re|paired to Rome, where they per&s;uaded Pope Boniface IX. who &s;ucceeded Urban, to declare again&s;t the &s;ta|tutes of provi&s;ors, <HI>quare impedit,</HI> and <HI>premunire:</HI> but the government was &s;o far from repealing tho&s;e
<PB N="266" REF="293">laws, that they were confirmed in parliament; which likewi&s;e enacted, that any per&s;on within the realm, bringing or &s;ending &s;ummons, cen&s;ure or &s;entence of excommunication, again&s;t any per&s;on what&s;oever for his a&s;&s;ent to or execution of the &s;aid &s;tatute of provi&s;ors, &s;hall be arre&s;ted, impri&s;oned, and forfeit all his lands, tenements, goods and chattels, and incur the penalty of life and member; and any prelate executing &s;uch &s;um|mons, cen&s;ure, or &s;entence of excommunication, &s;hall be deprived of his temporalities; and they &s;hall remain in the King's hands for due redre&s;s and correction.</P>
<P>The Archbi&s;hops, &s;uffragans, and clergy, prote&s;ted in general terms again&s;t this bill; and this prote&s;t brought an impeachment by the Commons on the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, for obeying the Pope in publi&s;hing &s;uch cen&s;ures, as tended to the open di&s;he|ri&s;on of the crown, the &s;ubver&s;ion of the royal prero|gative of the King's laws, and his whole realm; and for aiding and abetting his holine&s;s in a &s;cheme for tran&s;lating Engli&s;h prelates to foreign &s;ees, to the pre|judice of the King, the impoveri&s;hing of the nation, and contrary to the &s;tatutes of the realm. The Arch|bi&s;hop in his defence acquitted him&s;elf entirely of the charge, prote&s;ting that he would adhere loyally to the King; and endeavour, as in his duty bound, to &s;up|port his Maje&s;ty in the&s;e and all other in&s;tances, in which the rights of the crown might be concerned. His an&s;wers were extremely agreeable to the Com|mons; the parliament enacted a new &s;tatute of <HI>premu|nire,</HI> more comprehen&s;ive than the former, as it affected not only the procurers, abettors, maintainers and coun&s;ellors, but even the favourers of the papal u&s;ur|pation; &s;o that all application to a foreign juri&s;diction, either in the court of Rome or el&s;ewhere, in prejudice of the King's crown and royalty, falls within the penalty of this &s;tatute<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet's Hi&s;tory of the Church, vol. v. p. 206.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="267" REF="294">
<P>A. D. 1391.] There was a &s;ynod in England, which (becau&s;e many were vexed for cau&s;es, which could not be known, at Rome) ordained, that the authority of the Pope &s;hould &s;tretch no farther than to the ocean &s;ea; and who &s;o appealed to Rome, be&s;ides excom|munication, &s;hould be puni&s;hed with the lo&s;s of all their goods, and with perpetual impri&s;onment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Church Hi&s;tory, p. 117.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Then came the parliament, wherein was enacted the &s;tatute, called the &s;tatute of <HI>premunire,</HI> which gave &s;uch a blow to the church of Rome, that it never re|covered it&s;elf in this land. The &s;tatute of Mortmain put the Pope into a &s;weat, but this put him into a fever: that concerned him only in the abbeys, his dar|lings; this touched him in his per&s;on.</P>
<P>Then were there two bulls &s;ent out by Pope Boni|face IX. one again&s;t the Lollards, another to King Richard II. Queen Anne, wife to King Richard, at the &s;ame time had the go&s;pels in Engli&s;h, with four com|mentators upon the &s;ame.</P>
<P>King Richard (on Pope Boniface's tran&s;lating Eng|li&s;h Bi&s;hops, 1397) wrote a notable letter to that pon|tiff, wherein he &s;heweth, that the election of the Pope was not as before, comparing the Popes to the &s;oldiers that crucified Chri&s;t; that &s;ecular Princes are to bridle the outrages of the Pope; and &s;eemeth to prophecy of the de&s;olation of the Roman Pope.</P>
<P>King Richard was not long after depo&s;ed, and bar|barou&s;ly murdered at Pomfret ca&s;tle. In the mean time of the con&s;piracy again&s;t Richard, among all the Bi&s;hops, only Thomas Merks Bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le was for him<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 118.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thus ended the inglorious reign of Richard II. a weak, vain, frivolous, and incon&s;tant Prince; with|out weight to balance the &s;cales of government; without di&s;cernment to chu&s;e a good mini&s;try; without virtue to oppo&s;e the mea&s;ures of evil coun&s;ellors, even

<P>Among&s;t the fir&s;t acts of Henry IV. after his ac|ce&s;&s;ion, was the convening of a parliament on October 14, 1399, which enacted &s;everal &s;tatutes in favour of his own partizans, and repealed divers acts and attain|ders in the preceding reign<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 229.</NOTE>.

<PB N="269" REF="296">Richard on the throne, and deprived Henry of his royalty: but an accidental di&s;covery, and the activity of the Mayor of Cirence&s;ter, rendered it abortive, and the chiefs of the in&s;urgents &s;uffered the death of traitors. The Bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le was tried and con|victed; but at length obtained a pardon, and died rector of Todenham in Glouce&s;ter. This in&s;urrection, in all probability, ha&s;tened the tragical end of the de|po&s;ed monarch, as his &s;ucce&s;&s;or thought his own &s;way precarious during the life of that Prince.</P>
<P>A new mi&s;under&s;tanding happening with Scotland, Henry marched to Edinburgh, and laid &s;iege to the ca&s;tle: but abandoned the enterprize, upon advice of a commotion in Wales, headed by Owen Glendourd|wy (commonly called Glendower) who was maternally de&s;cended from $lewellyn ap Griffith, the la&s;t Prince of that country; and conceiving him&s;elf injured in the i&s;&s;ue of a law-&s;uit with Reginald Lord Grey of Ruthyn, had recour&s;e to arms for ju&s;tice, and gaining &s;ome advantages over his antagoni&s;t, though that no|bleman's cau&s;e was &s;upported by the Engli&s;h monarch, induced his countrymen to declare him their Prince and Sovereign. Henry, alarmed at the progre&s;s of that bold Briton, convened a parliament in the beginning of 1401, which granted him a large &s;ub&s;idy; enacted &s;anguinary laws again&s;t the Lollards; and extended the penalties of the &s;tatute of provi&s;ors again&s;t &s;uch bulls from Rome, as di&s;pen&s;ed with obedience to the ordinary, pluralities, and non-re&s;idence; but with a clau&s;e, as to the la&s;t article, in favour of chaplains belonging to the court, the univer&s;ities, or peers. In &s;ummer the King entered Wales at the head of a nu|merous army: but being di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for provi&s;ions, and &s;everal of his parties cut off by the Wel&s;h, he was obliged to retreat, after ravaging the country; which Owen retaliated upon the territories of his country|men who favoured the Engli&s;h intere&s;t. His reputation
<PB N="270" REF="297">and number of followers increa&s;ing with his &s;ucce&s;s, Henry made another expedition again&s;t him; and re|turned with as little effect.</P>
<P>A. D. 1402.] The King had an account of Glen|dourdwy's having taken and defeated Lord Grey, and Edmund Mottimer Earl of Marche, the lineal heir of the crown. Henry rejoiced at Mortimer's captivity, but intere&s;ted him&s;elf for his favourite Grey; and dreading the progre&s;s of the victor, rai&s;ed a con&s;iderable number of forces, which he divided into three bodies, giving the command of one to his elde&s;t &s;on. The&s;e divi&s;ions entered Wales at three different places, in order to &s;urround Owen: but that brave Wel&s;hman baffled not only Henry's military operations, but al&s;o the ba&s;e means he employed to take away his life, and mortified him with a third repul&s;e. This di&s;a&s;ter was, however, &s;omewhat alleviated by the &s;ucce&s;s of the Engli&s;h troops under the Earl of Northumberland, his &s;on Henry Hot&s;pur, and other nobles, again&s;t the Scots commanded by Archibald Earl of Douglas, who was defeated and taken with &s;everal per&s;ons of di&s;tinction at Holmedon. Henry having demanded the di&s;po&s;al of the pri&s;oners, the Piercies were &s;o provoked at the inju&s;tice, that they con&s;ulted mea&s;ures with the Earl of Marche, Glen|dourdwy, and their captives, to expel their new mo|narch, and place Mortimer on the throne: but were routed at Shrew&s;bury, in July 1403, before they could be reinforced by Marche and Glendourdwy, or the Earl of Northumberland, who, though deeply enga|ged in the con&s;piracy, got him&s;elf acquitted in parlia|ment, which met in January 1404, and addre&s;&s;ed the King to di&s;mi&s;s certain foreigners, revoke grants of the crown-lands, and to retrench the expences of his hou&s;hold. Henry dreading a rupture with the French, who connived at the Bretons infe&s;ting the Engli&s;h coa&s;t, the Duke of Orlean's inva&s;ion of Guienne, and favoured the cau&s;e of Owen Glendourdwy, convened
<PB N="271" REF="298">another parliament (called the <HI>illiterate</HI>) in October, which after a fruitle&s;s attempt to &s;eize the revenues of the clergy, granted him a large &s;ub&s;idy, and made whole&s;ome re&s;olutions again&s;t alienations of the royal deme&s;nes.</P>

Scrope Arch|bi&s;hop of York, T. Mowbray Earl Mar&s;hal, the Earl of Northumberland, and others. The two fir&s;t, having taken the field, were outwitted and &s;eized by the Earl of We&s;tmoreland, and paid for their temerity with their heads. Upon this di&s;a&s;ter, Northumberland and Lord Bardolfe fled to Scotland, and making a fre&s;h at|tempt about three years afterwards, were routed and &s;lain, at Braham-moor, by Sir T. Rokeby, Sheriff of York&s;hire.</P>
<P>The year 1406 was di&s;tingui&s;hed by making James Prince of Scotland pri&s;oner, in his pa&s;&s;age to France, and for King Henry's narrowly e&s;caping the &s;ame fate from the French cruizers, as he was &s;ailing from Kent to Norfolk. In 1407, the King of England, having got rid of a turbulent adver&s;ary by the death of the Duke of Orleans, which was effected by the emi&s;&s;aries of the Duke of Burgundy, concluded a treaty with the Bur|gundians, and a truce with the Bretons. The reduction of Wales was completed, in 1408, by Prince Henry, notwith&s;tanding the brave efforts of Glendourdwy, who preferred the habit of a &s;hepherd to a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Engli&s;h government. In 1409, Henry was &s;ucce&s;sful again&s;t the Bretons; and concurred with the council of Pi&s;a in endeavouring to heal the &s;chi&s;m of the church. The year 1410 produced a difference between the King and Commons concerning the Lollards; and was memorable for the naval &s;ucce&s;s of the Engli&s;h again&s;t the Scots and French. Next year Henry ac|commodated
<PB N="272" REF="299">the Duke of Burgundy with &s;ome troops, which were very in&s;trumental in making the Duke ma&s;ter of Paris: but that Prince, upon his a&s;cendancy in the French court, having treated the Engli&s;h auxi|liaries with indifference, and evading the con&s;umma|tion of the march &s;tipulated between his daughter and the Prince of Wales, the Engli&s;h Monarch concluded an alliance with the Armagnac faction; which, how|ever, was rendered abortive by an accommodation be|tween the Dukes of Burgundy and Orleans, in 14$2.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of affairs then became &s;uch, that Eng|land enjoyed profound tranquillity: but the King was very much di&s;quieted at the profligate cour&s;es of the Prince of Wales, his heir apparent; who, however, gave &s;uch a&s;&s;urance of amendment, that his father died on March 20, 1413, in the 46th year of his age, ea&s;y on that head.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd year of his reigh, King Henry IV. ordained, that if any per&s;on &s;hould obtain, from the Bi&s;hop of Rome, any provi&s;ion to be exempt from obedience, regular or ordinary, or to have any office perpetual in any hou&s;e of religion, he &s;hould incur the points of premunire.

In that a&s;&s;embly, which enacted a &s;evere &s;tatute again&s;t the Lollards, and made a motion for &s;eizing the revenues of the clergy, the Commons obtained a confirmation of their privi|leges: in former times, the rolls of parliament had been frequently vitiated, by in&s;erting the petitions of the Commons in terms quite different from their in|tended meaning; but upon the humble repre&s;entation of that body, at this juncture, they were allowed to be a con&s;tituent part of the legi&s;lature, having been formerly only con&s;idered by the King and Lords as petitioners.</P>

After that, his Maje&s;ty landed in Augu&s;t, with about 50,000<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. iv. p. 315.</NOTE> land-forces, near Harfleur, which &s;urrendered in October. Here he had the mortification to find his army much weakened by the dy&s;entery; the enemy convening from all quarters; and the place untenable without a fre&s;h &s;upply of provi&s;ions, of which he could have no immediate pro&s;pect from England, as he had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed part of his tran&s;ports at his debarking, and the remainder had been d$&s;per&s;ed by tempe&s;t. In this &s;ituation he re&s;olved to march to Calais; and having left a garri&s;on of 3000 men in Harfleur, began his route towards the Somme, at the head of 20,000 &s;oldiers. When he reached the ford of Blanquetaque, he found the pa&s;&s;age ob&s;tructed there, and at other places up the river, till he arrived at that between St. Quintin and Peronne, from which the French had withdrawn their detachments, that, after Henry pa&s;&s;ed, they might engage him in a country, where his retreat was judged impracticable.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h Monarch, having forded the river, perceived, as he was advancing to Blagney, the whole French army, con&s;i&s;ting of 100,000 effective men, in motion, to intercept his route to Calais, the only place where he could expect relief and &s;helter<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid, page 318.</NOTE>. He then began to repent the temerity of his enterpri&s;e, and &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the French, offering to re&s;tore Harfleur, repair all the damage he had done, and to give &s;ecurity that he &s;hould never again invade France, if they would allow him to proceed unmole&s;ted to Calais. D'Albret, the Con&s;table, rejected the over|ture,
<PB N="278" REF="307">and haughtily in&s;i&s;ted, that Henry and his fol|lowers &s;hould &s;urrender at di&s;cretion: and under&s;tand|ing that the King treated the propo&s;al with di&s;dain, &s;ent three heralds to defy him to battle, leaving the time and place to his own choice. Henry replied, that in his then &s;ituation he would not &s;eek an en|gagement; but as he intended to pro&s;ecute his march to Calais, they might attack him when and where they thought proper. The enemy then took po&s;t between Rou&s;&s;eauville and Agincourt, and nominated the 25th of that month (October) for the day of encounter. As an action was unavoidable, the King of England ac|cepted the challenge, and during the three days inter|val, exerted the duties of an able and diligent com|mander; while the enemy, tru&s;ting to their &s;uperiority of number, were employed in riot and exultation, and be&s;ides playing at dice for their imaginary captives, had the in&s;olence to &s;end a herald to Henry, to know what he propo&s;ed to give for his ran&s;om. Early in the morning of the deci&s;ive day, the two armies pre|pared for battle. The French were drawn up in three lines, but were &s;o hampered in their po&s;ition, that they could not extend their front, and their &s;uperiority was an incumbrance in&s;tead of an advantage. The Eng|li&s;h Monarch, that the front of his troops might equal that of the fir&s;t divi&s;ion of the enemy, formed his army in one line, having placed a &s;mall detachment in am|bu&s;h on each wing. The Engli&s;h made the attack with &s;uch ardour, that the fir&s;t line of the enemy was &s;oon di&s;comfited, as was al&s;o their &s;econd at the next charge. Their third divi&s;ion was &s;till entire, and more numerous than the whole Engli&s;h army: but were &s;o intimidated with the di&s;a&s;ter of the other two lines, that they refu&s;ed to obey their officers, and immediately di&s;per&s;ed, when Henry acquainted them by a herald, that he would ma&s;&s;acre them without mercy, if they did not forthwith retire. A fal&s;e report having &s;pread, that tho&s;e troops were re-a&s;&s;embled, the King gave

Henry, in the beginning of the year 1419, became ma&s;ter of all Normandy, after it had been 215 years in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of France; and received the &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion of the neighbour $word$ country as far as the gates

The Duke of Burgundy had been &s;ome time wavering be|tween motives of &s;elf-intere&s;t and affection to his coun|try; but the rapidity of the Engli&s;h arms determined him in favour of his duty, and he propo&s;ed an accom|modation between England and France<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, p. 352.</NOTE>. He &s;uc|ceeded &s;o far, that the two courts agreed to an inter|view in the neighbourhood of Meulant, in &s;ummer 1419: but the conferences terminated abruptly by the intrigues of Burgundy, who had accommodated matters with Charles the Dauphin, whom all the ad|ver&s;aries of the Engli&s;h intere&s;t acknowledged Regent of France, during the di&s;order of Charles VI. his father.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h Monarch, enraged at being made a dupe to the &s;ame policy, which he had before u&s;ed with the Dauphin and Duke of Burgundy, &s;ent a de|tachment, on July 28, to &s;urpri&s;e Pontoi&s;e, and re|duce &s;ome other fortre&s;&s;es in the neighbourhood of Paris<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 358.</NOTE> His affairs, however, had but a very unfa|vourable a&s;pect: the di&s;tractions of France had pre|vented any oppo&s;ition again&s;t him in the field, &s;ince his la&s;t de&s;cent; but the agreement between the Dau|phin and Duke of Burgundy united the whole king|dom again&s;t him; his &s;ubjects were tired of a war, from which they could reap no benefit; the Dauphin had &s;ecured the intere&s;t of the Kings of Ca&s;tile and Ar|ragon; and a Ca&s;tilian fleet had orders to tran&s;port a body of Scotti&s;h troops for the &s;ervice of the Dauphin. But the gloom which hung over Henry's affairs was di&s;pelled, by the Dauphin's procuring the murder of the Duke of Burgundy, on September 10, at Monte|reau, whither he had invited him to an interview.</P>
<P>A. D. 1420.] The young Duke, glowing with re|venge, readily joined with the French Queen in every mea&s;ure that could di&s;tre&s;s her &s;on the Dauphin; and

The nuptials were &s;olemnized in June; and divers places &s;ubmitted to the Engli&s;h and Bur|gundian arms: after which Henry, with his father-in-law, made a magnificent entry into Paris<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, p. 365.</NOTE>; but had, by that time, lo&s;t the affection of the Duke of Burgun|dy, be&s;ides other peers and officers of France, by his own haughty carriage, and the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of his troops.</P>
<P>In January 1421, he brought his Queen to Eng|land, where he was crowned next month. During his ab&s;ence, the Duke of Clarence was defeated and &s;lain at Beaug&eacute;, on April 3<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 368.</NOTE>, by the Scotti&s;h troops in the &s;ervice of the Dauphin, who al&s;o obtained &s;everal other advantages.

The King returning to France, in June, with a fre&s;h army of 30,000 men, obliged the Dauphin to relinqui&s;h the &s;ieges he had un|dertaken, and reduced &s;everal places, which acknow|ledged that Prince's authority.</P>

In the mean time, the Dauphin took La Charit&eacute;, opened the pa&s;&s;age of the Loire, and afterwards inve&s;ted Co&s;ne on the &s;ame river. As Henry was marching to the relief of that place, he was &s;eized with a dy&s;entery, which put an end to his life, on Augu&s;t 31, in the 34th year of his age, at Bois de Vincennes; from whence his corp&s;e was brought to England, and interred in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey, where his Queen cau&s;ed his &s;tatue of &s;ilver, as big as the life, to be placed upon the monument.</P>
<P>When Henry V a&s;cended the throne, the Lollards expected, at lea&s;t, a relaxation of the grievances they had &s;uffered under his father. They were mi&s;erably mi&s;taken; for though Henry had been a libertine in his youth, yet he was a bigot to the religion in which he had been educated; and relying upon the clergy for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his de&s;igns again&s;t France, in|dulged them in the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their juri&s;diction again&s;t all deemed heretics. The principal object of the re&s;entment of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics was Sir John Oldca&s;tle,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Proceedings again&s;t Sir J. Oldca&s;tle.</NOTE> Baron of Cobham, in right of his wife Joan de la Pole: but as he was a per&s;on of great e&s;teem with the King, on ac|count of his bravery and military experience, they would not proceed again&s;t him without his Maje&s;ty's permi&s;&s;ion; which was not granted till after he had expo&s;tulated with Sir John, and found him inflexible in his &s;entiments. He was &s;ummoned to the eccle&s;i|a&s;tical-court by repeated citations, and paying no re|gard to the &s;ummons, was excommunicated. He was &s;oon afterwards apprehended, and brought before the Archbi&s;hop, who offered to ab&s;olve him, if he would recant and move for ab&s;olution. Sir John delivered a paper, containing his principles, to the Prelate, who allowed them to be good in the main, but in&s;i&s;ted on an explanation of the articles of auricular confe&s;&s;ion,

He pre&s;ented al&s;o a copy of his tenets to the King, and de|&s;ired to be tried by the law of arms: but that propo&s;al being rejected, he was committed to the Tower, and advi&s;ed to prepare his an&s;wers to certain queries he had received from the Archbi&s;hop by September 27, when the Convocation would &s;it at the Black-friars. When brought thither, Thomas Arundel, Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, admoni&s;hed him to crave the benediction of the court: to which he an&s;wered, "Cur&s;e on your benediction." Even after this indecent reply, the Primate told him, that if he would de&s;ire ab&s;olution in the common form, he &s;hould have it without he|&s;itation. To this he made an&s;wer, that he would de|mand no forgivene&s;s where he had given no offence. So &s;aying, he fell upon his knees, and, in an enthu&s;i|a&s;tic rhap&s;ody, confe&s;&s;ed all his &s;ins to God, in the hearing of the whole a&s;&s;embly. Being que&s;tioned con|cerning the euchari&s;t, he profe&s;&s;ed his belief, that, after the con&s;ecration, Chri&s;t's very body was pre&s;ent in form of bread, the very &s;ame individual body that was born of the Virgin Mary. Then he was a&s;ked, whe|ther or not it was the material bread after con&s;ecration? and turning to the Archbi&s;hop, &s;aid, "I believe it is Chri&s;t's body in the form of bread. Sir, believe you this?" "Yes, marry, do I" replied the Primate. He was next interrogated, If he thought any part of the bread remained after con&s;ecration? To which he replied, It is b$th Chri&s;t's body and bread. This was the rock upon which he &s;plit: for, notwith&s;tanding his explanation &s;upported by texts of &s;cripture, his opinion was declared heretical: and when he challenged the court to prove it &s;o, they appealed to the determina|tion of the holy church.

John prote&s;ted again&s;t their proceedings; and they &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors, inviting him to return: but he in&s;i&s;ted on &s;uch high terms, that they altered their &s;train, and &s;ummoned him to appear in nine days, on pain of being proceeded again&s;t as a fugitive and delinquent. John neglecting the citation, the council &s;u&s;pended him from the exerci&s;e of all Papal power, &s;piritual and temporal; having fir&s;t convicted him of &s;imony, alienating the goods and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of churches and mona&s;teries, of debauching nuns, and ince&s;t with his brother's wife, of denying the re&s;urrec|tion and a future &s;tate, and other gro&s;s crimes and im|pious opinions.

All this was done after Henry Chicheley &s;ucceeded Thomas Arundel in the archbi&s;hopric of Canterbury: but though that Prelate was a rigid ene|my of the Wickliffites, he &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed the Papal encroachments, which Martin V. &s;trove to ex|tend as far as any of his predece&s;&s;ors.</P>

His valour was &s;uch as no danger could &s;tartle, and no difficulty oppo&s;e: nor was his policy inferior to his courage. He managed the di&s;&s;en&s;ions among his ad|ver&s;aries with &s;uch addre&s;s as &s;poke him con&s;ummate in the arts of the cabinet. He fomented their jealou|&s;ies, and converted their mutual re&s;entment to his own advantages. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;elf-taught genius, that blazed out at once without the aid of in&s;truction or experience; and a fund of natural &s;agacity that made ample amends for the&s;e defects. He was cha&s;te, tem|perate, mode&s;t, and devout, &s;crupulou&s;ly ju&s;t in his admini&s;tration, and &s;everely exact in the di&s;cipline of his army, upon which he knew his glory and &s;ucce&s;s in a great mea&s;ure depended. But we cannot be &s;o far dazzled with his great qualities, as to overlook the defects in his character. His pride and imperious temper lo&s;t him the hearts of the French nobility, and frequently broke out in outrage and abu&s;e. That his di&s;po&s;ition was cruel, appears too evident from the ma&s;&s;acre of the pri&s;oners at Agincourt; from his be|haviour to the garri&s;ons of Rouen, Milan, Meaux, and other places, which he found difficult in reducing, as well as from the per&s;ecution of the Lollards, who may be con&s;idered as &s;o many &s;acrifices to his intere&s;t as well as to his religious bigotry, for thereby he ren|dered the clergy favourable to his views. All his re|nown was founded upon the mo&s;t pernicious ambi|tion, which &s;wallowed up every principle of ju&s;tice, and every con&s;ideration of humanity. He attacked the kingdom of France without the lea&s;t provocation; encouraged and bribed the fir&s;t noblemen there to re|nounce their allegiance and betray their country; he filled it with widows and orphans, after &s;hedding the blood of 20,000 men, and ruining a &s;till greater num|ber of families.

<HEAD>HENRY VI. <HI>&s;urnamed of</HI> Wind&s;or, A. D. 1422.</HEAD>
<P>Henry VI. was not full nine months old at his ac|ce&s;&s;ion to the crown of England, and by the death of his grandfather, on October 21 en&s;uing, &s;ucceeded to the title of King of France: but that event produced a revolution unpropitious to his claim. Many French noblemen, who thought it their duty to obey their late Monarch, without examining narrowly whether or not his conduct was for the advantage of their country, conceived them&s;elves obliged, notwith&s;tanding the treaty of Troye, which was the effect of compul&s;ion, to pay the &s;ame obedience to his &s;on the Dauphin, who got him&s;elf proclaimed Sovereign of France, by the name of Charles VII. and was crowned at Poitiers in the beginning of November.</P>
<P>The year 1423 began favourably to the Engli&s;h and Burgundians, who reduced &s;everal places in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of King Charles, routed his forces at Crevent, and fini&s;hed the conque&s;t of Champagne; but were wor&s;ted at Graville. The Engli&s;h mini&s;try had hi|therto detained James I. of Scotland, &s;uppo&s;ing, that, while he remained in their cu&s;tody, his &s;ubjects would take no material &s;teps to the prejudice of Eng|land; but finding that the Scots, in re&s;entment of their Sovereign's captivity, &s;upported Charles with con&s;iderable reinforcements, when his fortune was at the lowe&s;t ebb, now agreed to &s;et him at liberty, in terms of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>A. D. 1424.] The Engli&s;h arms were attended with various &s;ucce&s;s, until the battle of Verneuil, in Augu&s;t, when they obtained a complete victory over the troops
<PB N="289" REF="320">of Charles; who&s;e affairs, in all probability, would have been ruined thereby, if there had not happened a quarrel between the King's uncle, Humphrey Duke of Glouce&s;ter, and the Duke of Brabant, who&s;e wife Glouce&s;ter had married. That di&s;pute, together with the di&s;&s;en&s;ions in the court of England, prevented any military tran&s;actions of importance during the year 1425, and gave Charles an opportunity of detaching &s;ome of his mo&s;t con&s;iderable adver&s;aries from the Engli&s;h intere&s;t.</P>
<P>A. D. 1426.] The war was carried on with various &s;ucce&s;s, nether &s;ide having men to undertake any en|terpri&s;e of con&s;equence: but Henry's army being re|cruited next year with fre&s;h levies from England, and di&s;cord reigning among the adherents of Charles, the Engli&s;h &s;ubdued a number of places in 1428, and in|ve&s;ted Orleans, near which they routed a body of French in an encounter, commonly called "The bat|tle of Herrings."</P>
<P>In the year 1429, the affairs of Charles took a dif|ferent turn under the au&s;pices of the famous Joan of Arc<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. iv. p. 412.</NOTE>, a native of Lorrain, but generally &s;tiled "The Maid of Orleans," on account of her &s;urpri&s;ing ex|ploits for the relief of that city, which &s;he accompli&s;h|ed after a &s;iege of &s;even months. She then charged and routed the Engli&s;h at Patay, recovered many for|tre&s;&s;es held by them, and witne&s;&s;ed Charles's coronation at Rheims. After that, divers others &s;ubmitted to him, but he failed in an attempt on Paris; and, in May 1430, lo&s;t his friend the Maid of Orleans<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 422.</NOTE>, who was taken in a &s;ally at Compeigne. On December 17, this year, King Henry was crowned at Paris: the Duke of Bedford ordered the Maid of Orleans to be tried for witchcraft; and the court condemning her for here&s;y, &s;he was burnt at Rouen on May 30, 1431 during which year, the war was carried on in petty ex|cur&s;ions,
<PB N="290" REF="321">and &s;tratagems for the &s;urpri&s;al of towns and fortre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The year 1432 was di&s;tingui&s;hed by a continuance of the broils in the court of England, and the renewal of the factions in that of King Charles; but by nothing memorable in the field. In 1433, the pea&s;ants in Normandy made an in&s;urrection, which was ea&s;ily &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, p. 429.</NOTE>. A quarrel happened between the Dukes of Bedford and Burgundy; which, however, did not hinder the latter from a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the reduction of &s;ome places which &s;ubmitted to the Engli&s;h. Next year the war degenerated into petty excur&s;ions; and the con|ferences, at Arras, for an accommodation between the Kings of England and France, terminated abruptly. In 1435 the Engli&s;h intere&s;t got a &s;evere blow, by an accommodation between King Charles and the Duke of Burgundy<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 433.</NOTE>; e&s;pecially as John Duke of Bedford, Regent of France for his nephew King Henry, died about the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>In 1436, Paris &s;ubmitted to King Charles; the Duke of Burgundy was compelled to relinqui&s;h the &s;iege of Calais; the French alliance with Scotland was &s;trengthened by a match between Lewis the Dauphin, and King James's daughter Margaret<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 439.</NOTE>; and the Earl of Northumberland, making an irruption into Scot|land, was defeated at Poperden. Charles, next year, entered Paris in triumph, amid&s;t the acclamations of the people, who rejoiced to &s;ee their native Prince re|&s;tored to his capital, and fully di&s;po&s;ed to forget all the unkindne&s;s he had &s;uffered at their hands<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 443.</NOTE>: but their joy was interrupted by a dearth and dreadful in|fection, which raged to &s;uch a degree, that the royal family were obliged to leave the city, which in a little time became &s;o de&s;olate, that the wolves and bea&s;ts of prey prowled along the &s;treets, and fed upon the dying

<P>As the Engli&s;h had formerly taken advantage of the divi&s;ions in France, Charles VII. re&s;olving to follow the &s;ame maxims of policy, and to profit by the quar|rels that began to divide England, equipped two &s;quadrons, which infe&s;ted the Engli&s;h coa&s;ts, but with|out attempting any enterprize of moment: and the Scots invaded the northern counties.</P>

<P>Archbi&s;hop Chicheley, as already ob&s;erved, was a &s;trenuous oppo&s;er of the encroachments of the Roman pontiff in England. He endeavoured to annul papal exemptions from taxes, and particularly that which Cardinal Henry Beaufort, Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, had obtained in &s;avour of his dioce&s;e: and oppo&s;ed the great power with which the Pope had inve&s;ted that prelate. He pre&s;ented to the King a full extract of the nature, extent and mi&s;chievous con&s;equences of the legatine office; and as the Cardinal held his bi&s;hopric in commendam, remon&s;trated again&s;t the practi$e as unprecedented in this kingdom. He repre|&s;ented that the Engli&s;h church needed no &s;uch &s;upple|mental butre&s;&s;es as the power of legates <HI>a latere;</HI> that the office had been always dangerous to the crown of England, even when limited to one year; and that the danger mu&s;t be much greater from the Cardinal's commi&s;&s;ion, which was for life. Henry V. protected Chicheley again&s;t the Pope's re&s;entment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 225.</NOTE>: but upon the death of that Monarch, Martin V. poured forth his indignation again&s;t the Archbi&s;hop in a letter, wherein he accu&s;ed him of having neglected his pa&s;|toral care, and minding nothing but the means of ama&s;&s;ing wealth. He &s;aid that the primate &s;u&s;&s;ered his flock to brouze on poi&s;onous herbs; and that when wolves came to devour them, he &s;tood like a dumb dog without &s;o much as barking. Then he inveighed again&s;t the &s;tatute of <HI>premunire,</HI> as an act that repealed the laws of God and the church, and de&s;troyed the ancient u&s;ages of the kingdom. He complained that Jews, Turks, and infidels of all &s;orts, were allowed to land in England; whereas any per&s;on, commi&s;&s;ioned by the holy &s;ee, was treated as a common enemy: and he concluded with an order to the Archbi&s;hop to repair to the council, and u&s;e his intere&s;t there, and in the parliament, for the rever&s;al of that &s;tatute;

Chicheley &s;ent an apology for his conduct to Rome; notwith&s;tanding which, he was &s;everely re|primanded, and his legatine power &s;u&s;pended. From this &s;entence he appealed to a future council; or, if that &s;hould not &s;it, to the tribunal of God. Martin wrote monitory letters to all the clergy in England, expatiating upon the illegality of the acts of provi&s;ors and <HI>premunire.</HI> He &s;ent a letter to the two Archbi&s;hops, annulling all tho&s;e &s;tatutes, and forbidding the metro|politans to act upon the authority of &s;uch laws, on pain of excommunication; and at the &s;ame time wrote a monitory letter to the people of England, which he charged the primate to publi&s;h and affix in all public places. The Archbi&s;hop of York, with the prelates of London, Durham, and Lincoln, wrote to the Pope in favour of Chicheley: and their example was followed by the Univer&s;ity of Oxford, which gave te&s;timony greatly to the honour of the primate's character, and termed him <HI>the golden candle&s;tick of the church of England.</HI> The&s;e recommendations were ac|companied with a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive epi&s;tle of the Archbi&s;hop's own writing: but Martin remained implacable, and &s;ummoned Chicheley to Rome, as an enemy to the Roman intere&s;t in England. The Pope was the more exa&s;perated, as the nuncio, who delivered his letters and bulls, had been impri&s;oned by the government. This outrage produced letters from Martin to the King, the Duke of Bedford, and the parliament, com|plaining of &s;uch barbarous treatment, and exhorting them to concur in repealing the &s;tatutes. When the parliament met, Chicheley, attended by the metropolitan of York, and the prelates of London, St. David's, Fly, Norwich, together with the abbots of We&s;tmin|&s;ter and Reading, repaired to the hou&s;e of Commons; and, in an elaborate &s;peech, advi&s;ed them to repeal the &s;tatutes which had given &s;uch offence: but the members, &s;uppo&s;ing his harangue to be the effect of

The before-mentioned tran&s;actions happened at di&s;tant periods; but are here narrated conjunctly to pre&s;erve the hi&s;torical connexion. For the &s;ame rea|&s;on, it mu&s;t be mentioned that Archbi&s;hop Chicheley was famous for a great number of con&s;titutions which he enacted; enjoining the celebration of fe&s;tivals; regulating the probates of wills by admini&s;tration; in&s;tituting a kind of inqui&s;ition again&s;t Lollardi&s;m; providing again&s;t fal&s;e weights; reviving the con&s;titu|tion of John Peckham, Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who decreed that tho&s;e ca&s;es and articles, in which the &s;entence of the greater excommunication was in|curred, &s;hould be publickly declared in every pari&s;h-church for the information of the people; and aug|menting the &s;tipends of vicars, who were allowed to &s;ue for &s;uch augmentations <HI>in forma pauperum</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Archbi&s;hop, in 1347, founded <HI>All Souls college,</HI> in the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford,</HI> for a warden and forty fellows: which num|ber, by &s;tatute, was never to be augmented or impaired; and all void places, by death or otherwi&s;e, once in a year to be &s;upplied.

Several decrees were made to exalt the authority of the council above that of the pontiff: and the&s;e, as fa&s;t as they were enacted, did Eugenius cancel and annul; affirming that the mem|bers could not act without the direction of the head. As the Emperor, the King of France, and almo&s;t all the Princes of Europe, declared for the council, the Pope was fain to conform, and allow it to proceed: but, when he &s;ent other legates to pre&s;ide in his name, they refu&s;ed to receive him in that quality; and this refu&s;al was a new cau&s;e of di&s;&s;en&s;ion. Eugenius threatened again to di&s;&s;olve the council; and they, on the other hand, menaced him with a &s;entence of &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion. At length, however, the pontiff, finding him&s;elf unequal to the conte&s;t, dropped all oppo&s;i|tion, and confirmed the council. The&s;e advances were deemed &s;atisfactory, and the council admitted his le|gates: but the Emperor Sigi&s;mund dying in 1437, and the Greeks declaring for Eugenius, he retracted his conde&s;cen&s;ion, and tran&s;lated the council to Ferrara. The fathers at Ba&s;il, exa&s;perated at this &s;tep, filled all Europe with their remon&s;trances touching the Pope's perfidy: they prote&s;ted again&s;t the a&s;&s;embly at Ferrara, &s;ummoned all the prelates to repair to Ba&s;il in thirty days, and denounced excommunication again&s;t all tho&s;e who &s;hould ob&s;truct their coming. The council was &s;upported by the Germans, Spaniards, and the majority of the Italians. Charles VII. of France con|voked an a&s;&s;embly of his prelates, in which it was re&s;olved that France &s;hould own the authority of the council at Ba&s;il, but, at the &s;ame time, yield obe|dience to Eugenius. The Engli&s;h favoured that pon|tiff, becau&s;e the council had refu&s;ed to ratify the treaty of Troye<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See p. 281 of this volume.</NOTE>; and King Henry promi&s;ed to &s;end de|legates
<PB N="301" REF="334">to the council of Ferrara. Cardinal Julian, the pre&s;ident of the council, and all the other Cardi|nals, except one, abandoned Ba&s;il, and carried along with them a con&s;iderable number of Bi&s;hops to the Pope's council, which acquired &s;till more reputation and authority from the arrival of the Greek Emperor, with a numerous train of his prelates, at Ferrara; from which Eugenius removed the council to Florence, when it formed a &s;ort of union between the Greek and Latin churches; though this was of very &s;hort duration.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the fathers at Ba&s;il continued to proceed again&s;t Eugenius, whom at length they de|po&s;ed, and cho&s;e in his room Amadeus Duke of Savoy, who had re&s;igned the admini&s;tration of his dominions, and retired to a life of &s;olitude at Ripale. This new pontiff a&s;&s;umed the name of Felix V. and now a double &s;chi&s;m was formed between two general coun|cil and two Popes, who mutually condemned and ex|communicated one another, and all their adherents. In order to terminate this &s;candalous contention, an a&s;&s;embly was held in Germany by the Princes and pre|lates of the Empire, who could find no other expe|dient for that purpo&s;e than the convocation of a new council, till the meeting of which they &s;hould remain neuter. This propo&s;al was confirmed by the diet of Frankfort, in 1442; and the council of Ba&s;il a&s;&s;ented to it, though with great reluctance. Mean while Pope Felix, being di&s;contented at the proceedings of the fathers at Ba&s;il, who he thought acted with too high a hand, retired to Lau&s;anne, on pretence that the air of that place was more healthy than that of Ba&s;il; and Eugenius tran&s;lated his council from Florence to Rome, where the &s;e&s;&s;ion was held in the church of St. John of Lateran. The a&s;&s;embly at Frankfort unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved, that, if Eugenius &s;hould refu&s;e to give them &s;atisfaction with re&s;pect to certain grie|vances, they would acknowledge the election and au|thority
<PB N="302" REF="335">of Felix. Eugenius &s;crupled at fir&s;t to com|ply with their demands: but, the Emperor in&s;inuating that he would lo&s;e all the Empire by his non com|pliance, he conde&s;cended to grant all that the Germans de&s;ired; and a concordat was ratified accordingly. This was a terrible &s;troke to the council of Ba&s;il, which had been already di&s;owned by Italy, Arragon, and &s;everal other countries, be&s;ides England and France; though it conceived fre&s;h hopes from the death of its antagoni&s;t Eugenius, in 1447, who was &s;ucceeded by Nicholas V. Its authority, neverthele&s;s, dimini&s;hed daily; and Felix retained but a very &s;mall number of parti&s;ans. The King of France a&s;&s;embling an eccle|&s;ia&s;tical council at Lyons, to deliberate upon mea&s;ures for terminating the &s;chi&s;m, Felix &s;ent thither his lega|tes, and con&s;ented to re&s;ign the pontificate on certain conditions. This affair was the &s;ubject of a negotiation with Nicholas, who having granted all the demands of his competitor, Felix re&s;igned his dignity with the approbation of his council, which had by that time removed to Lau&s;anne, where, in its la&s;t decree (after having continued &s;eventeen years from its fir&s;t meeting in 1434) it approved the ce&s;&s;ion of Felix, created him Cardinal and legate <HI>a latere</HI> in Savoy and the Taren|rai&s;e, and allowed him to wear the pontifical habit for life. Nicholas ratified this decree: and thus ended the di&s;pute, which had produced a complication of three &s;chi&s;ms; fir&s;t, between Eugenius and the council of Ba&s;il, then between the two general councils, and la&s;tly between the two Popes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 232.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions abroad, John Stafford, &s;ucce&s;&s;or to Henry Chicheley in the archiepi&s;copal chair of Canterbury, &s;oon after his elevation having called a convocation, the clergy complained that the act of <HI>premunire</HI> was<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 231.</NOTE>, by the chicanery of the com|mon lawyers, turned into an engine of oppre&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="333" REF="336">which &s;ubjected them to vexatious &s;uits.

The&s;e, however, were deemed, by the majority, points of too delicate a nature for them to di&s;cu&s;s, and the motion was laid a&s;ide: but the grievance becoming more and more intolerable, the Bi&s;hops afterwards took it into con&s;ideration; and, after various debates, both hou&s;es of convocation re|&s;olved to addre&s;s his Maje&s;ty, and petition that the clau&s;e "or el&s;ewhere"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See p. 260 and 266 of this volume.</NOTE>, in the &s;tatute of <HI>premunire</HI> &s;hould be expunged. Lawyers, who had a mind to harra&s;s the clergy, u&s;ed to put &s;uch con&s;truction upon the words "or el&s;ewhere", as brought them within the &s;tatute, even when they pro&s;ecuted any matter of eccle&s;ia&s;tical right before the eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts with|in the kingdom. They therefore ob&s;erved, that the&s;e words "or el&s;ewhere" referred only to the place in which the Pope might chance to pre&s;ide, and praved that &s;ome remedy might be applied to this evil: but the times were too un&s;ettled for them to expect imme|diate &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>The zeal of the Engli&s;h clergy, in &s;upporting the Pope again&s;t the council, encouraged Nicholas V. to renew the papal encroachments in England. He &s;ent a pompous epi&s;tle to the King, together with a con|&s;ecrated ro&s;e; and at the &s;ame time demanded a tenth of the clergy. His reque&s;t, however, was denied; and the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury prohibited from executing the Pope's bull, or &s;uffering any money to be collected. In a &s;ub&s;equent convocation, held at London, Nicholas's agent &s;olicited a &s;upply. He expatiated upon the Pope's narrow e&s;cape from the wicked attempt of Stephen Porchard; inveighed
<PB N="304" REF="337">again&s;t the degeneracy of the Roman people; and de|clared, that, if the Engli&s;h would grant a proper &s;upply, the pontiff would immediately quit Rome and Italy, and re&s;ide in &s;ome place near England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 233.</NOTE>. All that the Engli&s;h clergy would grant, in con&s;equence of this remon&s;trance, was a form of prayer for the per&s;onal &s;afety of Nicholas. It was about this period that Archbi&s;hop Stafford died, and had for his &s;ucce&s;|&s;or Cardinal John Kemp, metropolitan for York, who dying &s;oon after his tran&s;lation, was &s;ucceeded by Car|dinal Thomas Bourchier, celebrated for a &s;et of articles of reformation which he compo&s;ed for his province.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t remarkable churchman of that age, was Reginald Peacock Bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter, a per&s;on of great learning and reputation, who publickly a&s;&s;erted, that the Latin fathers St. Jerome, St. Ambro&s;e, St. Augu&s;tin, and St. Gregory, ought to have no greater authority, than the &s;trength of their rea&s;oning, and the merit of their doctrine, acquired<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. v. p. 234, Church Hi&s;tory, p. 132.</NOTE>; that matter of faith could be judged by rea&s;on alone, to which he likewi&s;e referred all controver&s;y; that the Apo&s;tles were not the authors of the creed which goes by their name; that the meaning of the holy &s;criptures was to be learned from natural rea&s;on only; that Chri&s;t never de&s;cended into hell; and that Chri&s;tians were not obliged to ob&s;erve the canons, any farther than they &s;hould appear agreeable to rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e. He inveighed again&s;t the o&s;tentation and mag|nificence of churchmen; and reproached them for their neglect of parochial duties. He &s;aid, they them&s;elves might &s;it as originals of the deformity they la&s;hed; and that they recommended tho&s;e qualifications of which they found them&s;elves de&s;titute. His &s;atire again&s;t the pride and luxury of the prelates inflamed the populace to &s;uch a degree, that they rai&s;ed violent commotions in different parts of the kingdom. The
<PB N="305" REF="338">prelates of Chiche&s;ter and Sali&s;bury were murdered, and their hou&s;es pillaged; tho&s;e of Litchfield and Norwich were expelled from their habitations; and &s;everal other eccle&s;ia&s;tics lo&s;t their lives. Bi&s;hop Peacock was patronized by William de la Pole Duke of Suffolk, after who&s;e di&s;grace and death, his books were examined in a &s;ynod at Lambeth, and he him&s;elf obliged to recant great part of his doctrine. Then he was &s;ent to do penance at Canterbury, where he began to broach the &s;ame tenets anew, declaring publickly that the te&s;t of the &s;criptures was rea&s;on; that the practice of purcha&s;ing preferments from the Pope was unwarrantable; that no per&s;on was bound to obey the determination of the Roman church; that the belief of Chri&s;t's pre&s;ence in the euchari&s;t was not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation; and that the church may err in points of faith. His relap&s;e was no &s;ooner known, than he was brought from Canterbury to London, that he might undergo a trial, which he prevented by a &s;econd recan|tation. By this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion he &s;aved his life: but lo&s;t his bi&s;hopric, in lieu of which he was allowed an annual pen&s;ion, and died &s;oon after in a mona&s;tery at Maid&s;tone.</P>

<P>Edward had not enjoyed his royalty above eight days, when he found him&s;elf obliged to march again&s;t the indefatigable Queen Margaret, who was at the head of 60,000 men in the north; and though he had not above 49,000 in his own army, he attacked and routed the Lanca&s;trians, at Towton in York&s;hire, on March 29, being Palm-Sunday, when upwards of 36,000 per&s;ons fell in the action and pur&s;uit, or were drowned in the river Coc<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 60.</NOTE>. Having made proper regulations for pre&s;erving the peace of the northern counties, and leaving a body of troops &s;ufficient to repel any incur&s;ions that might be made from &s;ome ca&s;tles in Northumberland, who&s;e owners did not ac|knowledge his &s;overeignty, he returned to We&s;tmin&s;ter; where he was crowned on June 20. He then &s;um|moned a parliament, which, meeting on November 4, recogni&s;ed his title; repealed all the &s;tatutes made again&s;t the hou&s;e of York; declared Henry VI. an u&s;urper; re&s;cinded all his acts of royalty as illegal, and attainted that Prince, his Queen, and all their adherents.</P>
<P>After the battle of Towton, Henry and his Queen took refuge in Scotland, and delivered up Berwick to the Scots. After they had been &s;ome months there, Margaret, leaving her hu&s;band at Edinburgh, made a voyage to France, whence &s;he returned with a few troops, mo&s;t of whom were cut off or taken in Holy-i&s;land; and &s;he her&s;elf with difficulty reached Berwick.

After this di&s;a&s;ter, which rendered the Lanca&s;trian cau&s;e de&s;pe|rate, Henry and his con&s;ort, with much ado, got &s;afe|ly back to Scotland: and after re&s;iding &s;ome time at Edinburgh, Henry &s;et out from thence in di&s;gui&s;e for England, in hopes that the northern counties would ri&s;e again in his favour; but was taken at Waddington-hall, in Lanca&s;hire, where he had lain &s;ometime con|cealed, and carried to London on hor&s;e-back, with his legs tied under the hor&s;e's belly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 69.</NOTE>. After the capture of Henry, his Queen and &s;on, afraid of tru&s;ting to any per&s;on's fidelity, fled for refuge into woods and de&s;arts, where they &s;uffered the extremity of di&s;tre&s;s, till at length they were rifled by robbers, who would, in all probability, have deprived them of their lives, had they not quarrelled about the booty, and attacking one another, afforded an opportunity for the royal pri&s;oners to make their e&s;cape. They had not proceeded far, when they were met by another ruffian, who approach|ed them with a drawn &s;word in his hand, and fury in his a&s;pect. On this occa&s;ion, Margaret exhibited a remarkable proof of pre&s;ence of mind and re&s;olution. Taking her &s;on by the hand, and a&s;&s;uming an air of confidence and maje&s;ty, "Here, friend," &s;aid &s;he, "&s;ave my &s;on, the &s;on of the good King Henry." The robber was &s;truck with the dignity and beauty of her per&s;on, as well as the nature of her addre&s;s. He happened to be one of tho&s;e who had been out-lawed for adhering to her hu&s;band. His &s;avage heart was melted with compa&s;&s;ion, at the &s;ight of his Queen and Prince in &s;uch deplorable di&s;tre&s;s. He comforted them with the a&s;&s;urances of fidelity and protection, and carefully conducted them to a village near the &s;ea-&s;ide, where they embarked for Flanders.</P>
<PB N="309" REF="344">
<P>A. D. 1464.] Edward, being thus freed from ap|prehen&s;ion of di&s;turbance, exerted all his talents to render him&s;elf popular, and acquire the affections of his &s;ubjects, who had been alarmed and di&s;gu&s;ted by his former acts of &s;everity. He publi&s;hed a general indemnity in favour of all the Lanca&s;trians, who, within a certain &s;pecified time, &s;hould &s;ubmit to his government, and take the oath of allegiance. By this a&s;table deportment, he ingratiated him&s;elf with all de|grees of people; the meane&s;t &s;uppliant was admitted to his pre&s;ence, and every day was di&s;tingui&s;hed by his acts of compa&s;&s;ion and genero&s;ity. During this &s;ea&s;on of peace and good humour, his chief coun&s;ellors advi&s;ed him to convert his thoughts to matrimony: Ed|ward reli&s;hed the propo&s;al, and of the three matches named, preferred Bona of Savoy, &s;i&s;ter to the Queen of France.</P>
<P>A. D. 1465.] Richard Nevil, Earl of Warwick, who had contribued chiefly to place Edward on the throne, was commi&s;&s;ioned to &s;ettle the marriage-arti|cles with Lewis XI. the French Monarch, which he effected: but in the mean time, the King happening to &s;ee Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Richard Wideville, and widow of Sir John Grey of Groby, who had been &s;lain in the Lanca&s;trian &s;ervice, was &s;o captivated with her beauty, and virtue (which he un&s;ucce&s;sfully a&s;&s;ailed) that he wedded her, but &s;o privately, that the marriage was not divulged until he thought proper to i&s;&s;ue orders for her coronation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 73.</NOTE>. The fir&s;t families of the kingdom were extremely chagrined at the eleva|tion of Elizabeth, and the promotion of her kindred: but that, and the di&s;gu$$ of the nation in general, were but trivial circum&s;tances, when compared to the re&s;ent|ment of the Earl of Warwick, who looked upon this clande&s;tine match as the greate&s;t in&s;ult and affront that could be offered to his honour, and communicated his
<PB N="310" REF="345">&s;entiments to Lewis; who being equally incen&s;ed, did not fail to foment his indignation. Warwick, one of th$ proude&s;t men that ever lived, returned to England in th$ di&s;po&s;ition; which, however, he carefully con|cealed; and from this very di&s;&s;imulation Edward di|vined his thoughts: but, as it was then the intere&s;t of both to di&s;gui&s;e their real &s;entiments, the King con|tinued to treat him with exterior marks of re&s;pect; and the Earl maintained his place in the council, un|til his credit and influence were &s;uper&s;eded by the Queen's father, created Earl Rivers, and her other relations. The family of the Widevilles u&s;ed all their endeavours to render his Lord&s;hip unacceptable to the King, who had, indeed, very little rea&s;on to confide in his attachment, con&s;idering the ingratitude with which his eminent &s;ervices had been repaid, and had even attempted to debauch his daughter; an in&s;ult for which he could never expect forgivene&s;s from a man of Warwick's character.</P>
<P>A. D. 1469.] The Widevilles were become &s;o odi|ous to the nobility and people, that, for their own &s;afe|ty, they de&s;ired an accommodation with the family of Warwick, which was effected by the mediation of the King: but the reconciliation was &s;o far from being &s;incere, that &s;oon after the ceremony was over, the Earl repaired to his government at Calais, in order to execute a &s;cheme of revenge he had projected. He knew that George Duke of Clarence, next brother to the King, was incen&s;ed again&s;t Edward and his mini&s;try, who had excluded him from all advantageous offices, and all &s;hare in the admini&s;tration. In order to en|gage that Prince in his intere&s;t, he offered to him his daughter I&s;abel in marriage; and Clarence readily em|bracing an alliance that would put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one of the riche&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful young ladies in England, the marriage, notwith&s;tanding the endea|vours of the King to hinder it, was celebrated at Ca|lais. While Warwick re&s;ided there, he &s;eems to have
<PB N="311" REF="346">felt the pul&s;e of the Engli&s;h nation, by exciting an in&s;ur|rection in York&s;hire, which was &s;ucce&s;&s;ively headed by Robert Hilyard (commonly called Robin of Reddi&s;|dale) Sir Henry Nevil, and Sir John Conyers. The in&s;urgents defeated the royal army at Dane&s;more in Northampton&s;hire: after which Sir John Conyers, their leader, retired towards Warwick, to wait for the return of the Earl from Calais, by who&s;e direction he had hitherto proceeded. Whether Edward was igno|rant of this connexion, or thought proper to tempo|rize, certain it is, that when Warwick, and his &s;on-in-law Clarence, arrived in England, and offered their a&s;&s;i&s;tance towards re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the tranquillity of the kingdom, he received them with an appearance of &s;a|tisfaction, conferring &s;everal offices on Warwick. The King was likewi&s;e plea&s;ed to grant a general pardon to Conyers and his followers, by that time increa&s;ed to 60,000.</P>
<P>A. D. 1470.] Whatever were his Maje&s;ty's &s;enti|ments towards Warwick, he &s;eems to have been de|termined upon making a friend of his brother, John Lord Montague; probably with a view to le&s;&s;en the Earl's formidable power. He propo&s;ed a match be|tween his own daughter Elizabeth, and Montague's &s;on George, whom he created Duke of Bedford on January 5. Such a te&s;timony of the royal favour could not but be agreeable to the Nevils, who began again to live in a friendly corre&s;pondence with Edward, un|til it was interrupted by an artifice of the mini&s;try, who dreaded the revival of that family's intere&s;t. The King, while he re&s;ided at Langley in Hertford&s;hire, was in|vited by George, Archbi&s;hop of York, Warwick's brother, to an entertainment, at his &s;eat of Morepark, in that neighbourhood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 91.</NOTE>; and while the gue&s;ts were employed, according to the cu&s;tom of the time, in wa&s;hing hands before &s;upper, John Ratcliffe, after|wards
<PB N="312" REF="347">Lord Fitzwalter, told the King privately, that the Archbi&s;hop had a&s;&s;embled an hundred men at arms, to &s;eize and convey his Maje&s;ty to the ca&s;tle of Middle|ham in York&s;hire. Edward, alarmed at the intelli|gence, which was feigned for the purpo&s;e, made a pretence to go out, and mounting his hor&s;e, rode at full &s;peed to Wind&s;or. Such an abrupt retreat was con&s;trued into a gro&s;s affront by the Archbi&s;hop, as well as by Warwick and Clarence, who imagined it was a concerted &s;cheme, to tax them and their adhe|rents with perfidy; and both &s;ides reproached each other with great acrimony.</P>
<P>An accommodation was attempted by the Duche&s;s of York, the King's mother; but their mutual jea|lou&s;y was too deeply fixed to be ea&s;ily eradicated. Neverthele&s;s, Edward impowered Clarence and War|wick to array men in Warwick&s;hire and Glouce&s;ter|&s;hire, in order to &s;uppre&s;s an in&s;urrection in the county of Lincoln, headed by Robert Willes, Sir Thomas Dymock, and Sir Thomas de la Launde; though it afterwards appeared, that they had in&s;tigated the leaders to rai&s;e that commotion: after the &s;uppre&s;|&s;ion of which, by a deci&s;ive victory which the King obtained at Stamford, on March 14, his Maje&s;ty &s;ummoned Clarence and Warwick to appear before him by the 28th, on pain of being denounced rebels and traitors. The two chiefs paid no regard to this citation: they had endeavoured to excite a rebellion in Lanca&s;hire, York&s;hire, and Devon&s;hire; but their in|tention being fru&s;trated by the vigilance of the King, they embarked at Dartmouth for France.</P>
<P>Lewis XI. who was inflamed again&s;t Edward for the affair of the marriage, and a league lately concluded with the Duke of Burgundy, animated Warwick in his de&s;ign of re&s;toring Henry VI. to the throne of Eng|land. For that end, he effected a reconciliation be|tween Queen Margaret and the Earl, notwith&s;tanding
<PB N="313" REF="348">their former inveteracy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 96.</NOTE>; and one article of the agree|ment being a marriage between Anne, his younger daughter, and the Queen's &s;on, Prince Edward, War|wick became equally allied to the hou&s;es of York and Lanca&s;ter.</P>
<P>Clarence and Warwick, having received a &s;mall &s;upply of money and troops from Lewis, &s;et &s;ail from Havre de Grace, under a French convoy, and landed at Dartmouth, in September: but Clarence had been, during his re&s;idence in France, brought over to his brother's intere&s;t. They found them&s;elves, in a few days, at the head of 60,000 fighting men, with whom they began their march again&s;t Edward, who had made a progre&s;s into York&s;hire, to quell an in&s;urrec|tion rai&s;ed there by the Lord Fitzhugh, married to Alice, Warwick's &s;i&s;ter. The King, upon the infor|mation of the landing of Warwick, returned to Not|tingham, in his way to London; but the Earl, being re&s;olved to engage him before he &s;hould reach that capital, came in &s;ight of him within three miles of Nottingham: and Edward, di&s;couraged by the defec|tion of Montague, with 6000 troops, to the Lanca&s;|trians, &s;et out at midnight for Lynne, where he em|barked with his brother, Richard Duke of Glouce&s;ter, for Holland<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 100.</NOTE>. Next morning his army &s;ubmitted to Warwick, who forthwith directed his march for Lon|don, which he entered-in triumph, on October 6, and &s;et at liberty Henry VI. whom he had in&s;ulted in the mo&s;t opprobious terms, and even in&s;tigated the mob to deride, when leading captive from Lanca&s;hire, 1463.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this &s;urpri&s;ing revolution, a thorough change en&s;ued in every branch of the admi|ni&s;tration: and a parliament meeting on November 26, Edward was declared a traitor and u&s;urper; all &s;tatutes made by his authority repealed, and all his ad|herents
<PB N="314" REF="349">attainted. The crown was &s;ettled upon Henry and the male i&s;&s;ue of his body; and in default thereof, on the Duke of Clarence and his de&s;cendants: and that Duke, and the Earl of Warwick, were con&s;tituted Regents, during the minority of Prince Edward, Henry's &s;on.</P>
<P>A. D. 1471.] During the&s;e tran&s;actions in England, the fugitive King Edward, after &s;ome &s;tay at the Hague, repaired to his brother-in-law, the Duke of Burgundy; who, after much &s;ollicitation, was prevail|ed upon to accommodate him underhand with &s;hips and money. Thus &s;upplied, he embarked with about 1500 followers, and attemted to land in E&s;&s;ex. Be|ing repul&s;ed there, he &s;ailed to the north, and made a de&s;cent at Raven&s;pur in York&s;hire, about the latter end of March; hoping to be joined by the people of tho&s;e parts, as &s;oon as he &s;hould produce the Earl of Northumberland's invitation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 105.</NOTE>. However, he met with a very cold reception; and the inhabitants of Holderne&s;s took up arms to &s;top his progre&s;s. He likewi&s;e under&s;tood by his emi&s;&s;aries, that the citizens of York were not at all di&s;po&s;ed to receive him as So|vereign of England. He therefore profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a liegeman to King Henry; and declared, that all he demanded was the duchy of his father. Tru&s;ting to the effect of the&s;e profe&s;&s;ions, and the affection of the people of York, he marched towards that city, and was vi&s;ited by a deputation of the aldermen, who de|&s;ired that he would chu&s;e another road, that they might not be under the nece&s;&s;ity of refu&s;ing him ad|mittance. He again repeated his former declaration touching his demand; and expo&s;tulated with them, in a mode&s;t manner, upon the cruelty of denying him acce&s;s to the city from which he derived his title, and on which he had conferred &s;o many benefits: but he depended more on the attachment of the inhabitants
<PB N="315" REF="350">than the power of his eloquence; and was not di&s;ap|pointed in his expectation. His parti&s;ans excited a commotion in the city; and the magi&s;trates went forth to offer him the keys, and &s;tipulate for their being ex|empted from pillage. Edward agreed to all their pro|po&s;als; and being admitted into York, he alighted at the cathedral, where, by a &s;olemn oath, he confirmed his former prote&s;tations, that he would remain a loyal &s;ubject to Henry; and with re&s;pect to his demand, concerning his private inheritance, leave it entirely to the deci&s;ion of parliament. He &s;aw his forces encrea&s;e daily, and borrowed money from the citizens for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; till at length, when he had a&s;&s;embled a body of troops, he left a &s;trong garri&s;on in the place, and began his march for London.</P>
<P>When he arrived at Nottingham, his numbers en|crea&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, as encouraged him to publi&s;h his claim to the crown<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 106.</NOTE>. Mean while Warwick, having levied a body of troops, advanced to Leice&s;ter, in or|der to join his brother Montague, who was at the head of a con&s;iderable force, but had allowed Edward to pa&s;s by him unmole&s;ted; and receiving intelligence that Edward had taken the route to Coventry, march|ed thither, with a view to hazard an engagement. When the two armies were in &s;ight of each other, the Earl received a letter from Clarence, advi&s;ing him that he was on his march to join him, and de&s;iring him to decline battle till their junction; and in compliance therewith allowed his antagoni&s;t to proceed to Lon|don, believing that city would hold out until he &s;hould advance to its relief. This was a flagrant piece of mi&s;|conduct; for the rich merchants there, who had lent Edward great &s;ums, had no other pro&s;pect of payment than by his re&s;toration; the intere&s;t of the ladies was in favour of that Prince; the Archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury, with &s;everal noblemen and other prelates, were
<PB N="316" REF="351">well-wi&s;hers to his cau&s;e; and the &s;anctuaries and franchi&s;es of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter contained above 2000 parti&s;ans of the hou&s;e of York. Be&s;ides, War|wick's brother, the Primate of York, to who&s;e care the per&s;on of Henry and the city of London were com|mitted, had made his peace with Edward, who, by his connivance, was admitted into the city, and &s;eized Henry in the palace of the Bi&s;hop of London.</P>
<P>In the mean time Warwick, being reinforced by Clarence his &s;on-in-law, and his own brother Monta|gue, advanced towards the capital, and, on April 13, encamped on Barnet heath<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 108.</NOTE>, that town being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the troops of Edward, who had marched thither from London, to give him battle, in con&s;equence of a me&s;&s;age &s;ent him by Clarence, who promi&s;ed to join him with all his forces, and that very night, receiving a vi&s;it from Glouce&s;ter, went off with about 12,000 troops to the Yorki&s;ts quarters, from whence he &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to Warwick, excu&s;ing his own conduct, and acquainting him that he had made his peace with Edward. The Earl received the me&s;&s;age with di&s;dain; and early in the morning of the 14th, being Ea&s;ter-day, both armies came to action. Victory &s;eemed at fir&s;t to incline to the Lanca&s;trians: but when the Earl of Ox|ford was returning from the pur&s;uit of the fir&s;t line of the Yorki&s;ts, Warwick's followers, mi&s;taking, thro' the medium of a thick fog, the radiant &s;tar on Oxford's &s;tandard for the cognizance of Edward, which was a &s;un, fell upon their friends with &s;uch fury, that they were broken and di&s;per&s;ed before their leaders could rectify the fatal error. Other parts of the Lanca&s;trian army, &s;eeing them fly, were &s;eized with con&s;ternation, and univer&s;al confu&s;ion en&s;ued. Edward, taking ad|vantage of their di&s;order, charged them with redoubled vigour; and Warwick endeavoured to rally and reani|mate them by his own example. This Earl (u&s;ually
<PB N="317" REF="352">&s;tiled <HI>the King-maker</HI>) after having exerted all his ca|pacity as an officer and hero, in fruitle&s;s attempts, ru&s;hed into the hotte&s;t part of the action, and fell covered with wounds, as did his brother Montague endeavouring to di&s;engage him. All oppo&s;ition ended with the lives of the&s;e two noblemen: and about noon the Yorki&s;ts, with the lo&s;s of about 1500 of their friends, obtained a complete victory over their enemies, of whom 5000 were left dead upon the field.</P>
<P>Edward had not long time to enjoy the fruits of his advantage, before he was alarmed with the tidings of Queen Margaret's having landed at Weymouth, on Ea&s;ter-day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v, p. III.</NOTE>. The news of Warwick's death, and the impri&s;onment of her hu&s;band, &s;o dejected her, that &s;he took refuge with her &s;on in Beaulieu-abbey in Hamp&s;hire. Her &s;pirits, however, revived, when &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf joined by a con&s;iderable number of nobi|lity and gentlemen, with their va&s;&s;als and adherents; and with them advanced to Tewke&s;bury. Edward came up with them &s;o &s;uddenly, that on May 4, be|fore &s;he could pa&s;s the Severn in order to march into Wales, where there was a large body in arms for Henry, he attacked and routed her army intrenched in a park adjoining to the town. Prince Edward was ba&s;ely a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated after the battle; and his mother, Queen Margaret, being found on the field in a waggon, more dead than alive, was &s;ent pri&s;oner to the Tower, where &s;he remained about four years, until the King of France paid 50,000 crowns for her ran&s;om.</P>
<P>The unfortunate Henry VI. &s;urvived the&s;e commo|tions but a &s;hort time, being found dead in the Tower on May 21, in the 51&s;t year of his age; and his death is generally a&s;cribed to Richard Duke of Glouce&s;ter.</P>
<P>A. D. 1475.] The tranquillity of England being re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, Edward revived the old preten&s;ions to the French monarchy; and having concluded divers
<PB N="318" REF="353">treaties with the Dukes of Burgundy and Brittany, landed with an army at Calais about the end of June<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 122 &amp; 125.</NOTE>. On his arrival there, he &s;ent an herald to &s;ummon Lewis XI. to deliver up the crown and kingdom of France; and, in ca&s;e of a refu&s;al, to denounce war and vengeance. The French King, having heard the herald's me&s;&s;age without emotion, replied, that Edward had taken this violent &s;tep at the in&s;tigation of the Duke of Burgundy and the Con&s;table de St. Pol, and would be deceived by both the&s;e allies. The event verified the prediction, for the allies performed no part of their engagements; and the King of England, perceiving him&s;elf a dupe to their intere&s;ts, made a &s;eparate peace with Lewis; after which the two Monarchs had an interview on the bridge of Pequigny.</P>
<P>A. D. 1478.] Edward, being at peace with all his neighbours, had become indolent and avaricious; and the admini&s;tration was wholly engro&s;&s;ed by the Queen and her relations, who rendered them&s;elves odious to the nation, not only by their in&s;atiable thir&s;t of power, but al&s;o by their in&s;olent demeanor, and the pride they &s;eemed to take in &s;lighting and thwarting the &s;chemes of the King's brothers, George Duke of Clarence and Richard Duke of Glouce&s;ter. The latter, who was naturally clo&s;e and con&s;iderate, di&s;&s;embled his re&s;entment &s;o as to prevent an open rupture: but Clarence could not &s;uppre&s;s his di&s;content, which was fomented by the cunning in&s;inuations of Glouce&s;ter, who had already formed a de&s;ign upon the crown, which he could not well accompli&s;h &s;o long as Clarence &s;tood between him and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.

<PB N="319" REF="354">The Queen and her kindred reinforced the &s;ugge&s;tions of Glouce&s;ter in &s;uch a manner, that his Maje&s;ty con|ceived a real &s;u&s;picion and di&s;gu&s;t again&s;t Clarence: and this Prince, incen&s;ed at his treatment, became louder in his complaints again&s;t the mini&s;try, who re&s;olved to accompli&s;h his de&s;truction. A parliament meeting on January 16, Clarence was brought to his trial on an indictment for high trea&s;on, which he de|nied, and offered to prove his innocence in &s;ingle combat: but the King being his accu&s;er, and declaring him&s;elf well &s;atisfied and convinced of the truth of the impeachment, no evidence was examined, and no member pre&s;umed to &s;peak in behalf of the unfortu|nate Prince, who was therefore convicted, and con|demned to die the death of a traitor. The &s;entence, however, was re&s;pited; and probably his life would have been &s;pared, had not Edward's indignation been kept up by the intrigues of the Queen and Glouce&s;ter, and his apprehen&s;ion arou&s;ed by a ridiculous prophecy, implying that the name of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or &s;hould begin with a G. The mini&s;try would not even venture the popular re&s;entment by a public execution, although the parliament had petitioned that it might be done with|out delay; and Clarence was found dead in the Tower on March 21, being generally &s;uppo&s;ed to have been drowned in a butt of Malm&s;ey wine.</P>
<P>The following part of this reign was employed in unavailing treaties on the continent, without any inte|re&s;ting exploit at home, until the year 1482, when the Duke of Glouce&s;ter, in an expedition to Scotland, re|covered Berwick, and concluded a peace with that nation.</P>

<P>Edward IV. found the friend&s;hip of the clergy &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that he granted a charter exempting them from the juri&s;diction of the civil power in criminal cau&s;es, remitting all &s;uch to the judgment of their or|dinaries. He likewi&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed the juri&s;diction of eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts with regard to tythes, and allowed them to i&s;&s;ue &s;piritual cen&s;ures again&s;t &s;uch as &s;hould invade their prerogatives<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, p. 64 &amp; 236.</NOTE>.

However, we find in&s;tances of his &s;everity to individuals among them. We have already taken notice that George Nevil, Archbi&s;hop of York, procured him an ea&s;y admittance into London, and by that means was in a great mea&s;ure the cau&s;e of his re&s;toration. Neverthele&s;s, when Edward granted a pardon to William Wainfleet Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter (founder of Magdalen-college and Magdalen-hall, in the Univer&s;ity of Oxford) and &s;even other prelates who had been parti&s;ans of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, he &s;ent Nevil into exile, and impri&s;oned him for &s;everal years in the ca&s;tle of Gui&s;nes, during which time the King enjoyed the revenues of his &s;ees, after having &s;eized all his other effects, among which was a mitre &s;o rich, that he made him&s;elf a crown thereof. This prelate was, in the &s;equel, re&s;tored to his liberty and dioce&s;e, but went drooping till the day of his death; and it added much to his &s;orrow, that Pope Sixtus IV. erected St. Andrew's into an archbi&s;hopric, independent of
<PB N="321" REF="356">his &s;ee, which claimed a juri&s;diction over the church of Scotland. Sixtus, however, to make an atonement, i&s;&s;ued &s;everal bulls to &s;creen the clergy from the in|croachments of the laity, as well as &s;or confirming, renewing, and increa&s;ing, the privileges of the Univer|&s;ity of Oxford<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 117 &amp; 236.

This occa&s;ioned a violent di&s;pute, in which the opponents of the friars maintained, that there was a great difference between begging and taking what the bounty of others doth freely confer, as our Saviour did from &s;uch who did mini&s;ter unto him of their &s;ub&s;tance<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Church Hi&s;tory, p. 132.</NOTE>.

<P>Again&s;t the mendicants appeared Thomas Wil&s;on, LL. D. and, according to &s;ome, Dean of St. Paul's, a zealous preacher and di&s;putant:&mdash;and William Ivy, canon of St. Paul's, who afterwards wrote in

<HEAD>RICHARD III. <HI>&s;urnamed</HI> Crook-back, A. D. 1483.</HEAD>
<P>The Duke of Glouce&s;ter, having paved his way to the throne by perfidy and murder, was proclaimed King by the name of Richard III. on June 22; and on July 6, was crowned, together with Anne his Queen, daughter of the renowned Earl of Warwick, and widow of Prince Edward, whom he a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated at Tewke&s;bury. Soon afterwards he made a cricuit through &s;everal counties, under pretence of reforming abu&s;es. It was during this progre&s;s that his two nephews, King Edward and Richard Duke of York, were &s;aid to be murdered in the Tower, as at this time they certainly di&s;appeared: but &s;ome writers are of opinion, that Edward died of grief, and that his bro|ther made his e&s;cape, and in the &s;equel was di&s;tingui&s;h|ed by the name of Perkin Warbeck.</P>
<P>Before Richard returned to London, he vi&s;ited the city of York, and was crowned there a &s;econd time. But in the mean time, Henry Stafford, Duke of Buckingham, having been affronted by Richard, whom he was very in&s;trumental in rai&s;ing to the throne, re|tired in di&s;gu&s;t to his ca&s;tle of Brecknock; and there, in conjunction with John Morton, Bi&s;hop of Ely (com|mitted to his cu&s;tody for oppo&s;ing the tyrant's eleva|tion) concerted a plan for depo&s;ing the u&s;urper, and giving the crown to Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond, provided he would marry Elizabeth, elde&s;t daughter of Edward IV. This being approved by all the parties, and the Duke of Brittany inclined to favour the enter|prize, a&s;&s;ociations were formed in different counties for a general in&s;urrection: but Richard, being ap|pri&s;ed of the con&s;piracy, a&s;&s;embled an army, and Buckingham being &s;topped from joining his confede|rates by the overflowing of the Severn, which la&s;ted &s;ix days, his Welch followers, di&s;pirited with fatigue and famine, di&s;per&s;ed; and the Duke, being &s;oon af|terwards
<PB N="324" REF="359">taken, lo&s;t his head. His friends, who wait|ed his pa&s;&s;ing the Severn, hearing of the de&s;ertion of the Welch, &s;everally &s;hifted for them&s;elves: and Richmond, arriving on the coa&s;t of Dor&s;et, was obliged to return to the continent for want of adherents.</P>
<P>A. D. 1484.] Richard, having &s;acri&s;iced a great number of the in&s;urgents to his vengeance, and being di&s;appointed in his views of getting the Earl of Rich|mond into his hands, employed his invention to pre|vent that nobleman's intended marriage with Eliza|beth, whom he re&s;olved to make his own wife: but there was a nece&s;&s;ity to $$$ve his pre&s;ent confort, and obtain the con&s;ent of the Q$$$ dowager, who&s;e brothers he had butchered. Le cajol$d her in &s;uch a manner, that &s;he left the &s;anctuary, with her five daughters, and appeared with them at court, where they were mo&s;t graciou&s;ly received: and Anne, his Queen, did not long &s;urvive; being &s;uppo&s;ed to be killed either with unkindne&s;s or poi&s;on. His addre&s;&s;es to his niece were received with horror: but he did not doubt of being able to vanqui&s;h her reluctance, tho' he delayed the de&s;ign till a more favourable opportunity &s;hould occur, as he did not think it would be politic to force her inclinations.</P>
<P>A. D. 1485.] In the mean time the Earl of Rich|mond was &s;oliciting &s;uccours from the court of France, which having at la&s;t procured, he &s;et &s;ail from Har|fleur, and landed in Milford-haven in Wales, on Au|gu&s;t 6. Richard, being informed of his arrival, col|lected 12,000 forces, 5000 of which were under the command of Lord Stanley (married to the Earl's mother) and his brother Sir William; and took po&s;t between Leice&s;ter and Coventry, in order to &s;top the progre&s;s of his antagoni&s;t, who&s;e troops did not exceed 5000. On Saturday, Augu&s;t 22, the two armies met at Bo&s;worth, and attacked one another mo&s;t furiou&s;ly; but the event remained doubtful, till the two Stanleys went over with their followers to the Lanca&s;trians:

<P>Such was the end of Richard III. the mo&s;t cruel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Cha|racter.</NOTE> unrelenting tyrant that ever &s;at on the throne of England. He &s;eems to have been an utter &s;tranger to the &s;ofter emotions of the human heart, and entirely de&s;titute of every &s;ocial &s;entiment. His ruling pa&s;&s;ion was ambition, for the gratification of which he trampled upon every law, both human and divine: but this thir&s;t of ambition was unattended with the lea&s;t mark of genero&s;ity, or any de&s;ire of rendering him&s;elf agreeable to his fellow creat$$es: it was the ambition of a &s;avage, not of a Prince; for he was a &s;olitary being, altogether deta hed from the re&s;t of mankind, and incapable of that &s;atisfaction which re&s;ults from private friend&s;hip and di&s;in$$re&s;ted &s;ociety. We mu&s;t acknowledge, however, that, after his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, his admini&s;tration in ge|neral was conducted by the rules of ju&s;tice; that he
<PB N="326" REF="361">enacted &s;alutary laws, and e&s;tabli&s;hed wi&s;e regulations; and that, if his reign had been protracted, he might have proved an excellent King to the Engli&s;h nation. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an uncommon &s;olidity of judgment, a natural fund of eloquence, the mo&s;t acute penetration, and &s;uch courage as no danger could di&s;may. He was dark, &s;ilent, and re&s;erved, and &s;o much ma&s;ter of di&s;&s;imulation that it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to dive into his real &s;entiments, when he wanted to conceal his de&s;igns. His &s;tature was &s;mall, his a&s;pect cloudy, &s;evere and forbidding; one of his arms withered, and one &s;houlder higher than the other, from which cir|cum&s;tances of deformity he acquired the epithet of Crook-back. Richard III. was the la&s;t of the Anje|vin race, &s;urnamed Plantagenet, which had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the crown of England for the &s;pace of three hundred and thirty years: but he was not the la&s;t male of that family in England; for the Earl of Warwick, &s;on to George Duke of Clarence, was &s;till alive, and the only remaining branch of all the numerous po&s;terity of the third Edward, which had been almo&s;t totally extingui&s;hed in the civil war; a war which had raged for thirty years, and was terminated by the battle of Bo&s;worth, after having co&s;t the lives of above one hundred thou&s;and Engli&s;hmen, including a great num|ber of princes of the hou&s;es of York and Lanca&s;ter.</P>

<HEAD>HENRY VII A. D. 1485.</HEAD>
<P>Henry, in a few days after his arrival at London, &s;olemnly renewed the oath he had formerly taken to wed the Prince&s;s Elizabeth, though he re&s;olved to de|fer the performance till after his coronation, which was &s;olemnized on October 30, when he in&s;tituted the yeomen of the guard. In November the parliament entailed the crown upon him and the heirs of his body.</P>
<P>A. D. 1486.] Although Henry hated the family of York, he found it nece&s;&s;ary to fulfil his engagement
<PB N="327" REF="362">to marry the Prince&s;s Elizabeth; and the nuptials were &s;olemnized on January 18, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible joy of the nation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 243.</NOTE>: but the demon&s;trations of popular &s;atisfaction were extremely mortifying to the King, who con&s;idered them as &s;o many marks of affection to the hou&s;e of York, for which he had conceived &s;uch an aver|&s;ion, that he always treated his Queen with the utmo&s;t coldne&s;s and ind$fference, and never let &s;lip an oppor|tunity to humble the parti&s;ans of her hou&s;e, towards whom he acted rather as the chief of a party, than as an equitable Sovereign. Whil&s;t Henry was on a tour through the northern counties, he received information that Lord Lovel, with Humphrey and Thomas Staf|ford, were actually in arms; at which he was not a little &s;tartled: but his apprehen&s;ions were &s;oon removed by the in&s;urgents di&s;per&s;ing on offer of pardon.</P>
<P>The birth of his elde&s;t &s;$n, Prince Arthur, on Sep|tember 20, gave hopes to the nation, that this event would warm Henry's indifference into a real affection for the mother<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 247.</NOTE>; but when they &s;aw that it had no &s;uch effect, that he delayed her coronation; that his di&s;po&s;ition was fordid and illiberal, and his temper &s;ullen and re&s;erved, they looked upon him with dete&s;tation, and began to think they had made a bad exchange for the tyrant Richard. His enemies took this oppor|tunity to in&s;inuate, that he intended to murder the Earl of Warwick in the Tower; and it was whi&s;pered that the Duke of York had made his e&s;cape from the cruelty of his uncle, and was &s;till alive on the conti|nent.</P>
<P>The univer&s;al joy expre&s;&s;ed by the Engli&s;h people at this report, encouraged Richard Simon, a prie&s;t of Oxford, to project the affair of Lambert Simnel, a youth of uncommon vivacity and extraordinary per|&s;onal accompli&s;hments, whom he re&s;olved to pa&s;s upon the world as that Duke: but upon a &s;urmi&s;e that the
<PB N="328" REF="363">Earl of Warwick had e&s;caped from the Tower, he de|termined that Simnel &s;hould per&s;onate this nobleman. Having properly tutored his pupil, he carried him to Ireland, where the impo&s;ture &s;ucceeded &s;o far that he was, without oppo&s;ition, proclaimed King, by the name of Edward VI.</P>
<P>A. D. 1487.] By this time the &s;pirit of di&s;affection, which had become general in England, was very much inflamed by the King's confining the Queen Dowager in the mona&s;tery of Bermond&s;ey, and depriving her of her whole e&s;tate, without any form or trial. The tutors of Simnel (who had been crowned King of Ire|land, and reinforced with 2000 German troops) hoping to benefit them&s;elves of the di&s;po&s;ition in England, landed with about 8000 men in Lanca&s;hire, where they were joined by very few. Henry had made the nece&s;&s;ary preparations for their reception, and under|&s;tanding that their route was towards Newark; he attacked them on June 6, at the head of 12,000 troops, at the village of Stoke, and, after an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance of three hours, obtained a complete victory. Lambert Simnel and Simon the prie&s;t were made pri|&s;oners; and Henry affected to de&s;pi&s;e his rival &s;o much, that he would not take his life, but retained him at fir&s;t as a &s;cullion in his kitchen, and afterwards as a falconer.</P>
<P>Henry, after the battle, having made a journey to the north, ob&s;erved that the di&s;contents of the people proceeded in a great mea&s;ure from his &s;everity to the parti&s;ans of the hou&s;e of York, and in particular for his having delayed &s;o long the Queen's coronation: there|fore, upon his return to London, he ordered it to be &s;o|lemnized on November 25. The parliament meeting the &s;ame month, voted the King a large &s;upply for the &s;upport of the Duke of Brittany again&s;t Charles VIII. of France; and confirmed the authority of the &s;tar-chamber, a court which had hitherto &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by
<PB N="329" REF="364">the ancient common laws of the realm<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 263.</NOTE>. They like|wi&s;e enacted a &s;tatute, by which any &s;ervant of the King, under the degree of a nobleman, con&s;piring the death of any member of the council, or Lord of the realm, &s;hould be deemed guilty of a capital crime. The &s;ame penalty was extended to tho&s;e who &s;hould obtain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of women by force, how&s;oever they might afterwards be reconciled to their ravi&s;hers.</P>
<P>A.

<P>A. D. 1492.] The King of England conceiving him&s;elf ill u&s;ed in divers negotiations by the French Monarch, during the three preceding years, convoked a parliament in the beginning of this year, and ac|quainted them with his re&s;olution to recover the kingdom of France, as the inheritance of his ance&s;tors, demand|ing, at the &s;ame time, a &s;upply &s;uitable to the great|ne&s;s of the occa&s;ion. The parliament complying with his reque&s;t, he made &s;ome preparations, and after divers delays landed in October at Calais; from which he marched to inve&s;t Boulogne. Charles the French King, though he was not ignorant of Henry's pro|ceedings, had not even a&s;&s;embled an army to oppo&s;e him: and, in eight days after the &s;iege of Boulogne was undertaken, peace was concluded between the two kingdoms at E&s;taples, without &s;o much as men|tioning the re&s;titution of any of the French dominions. He was reimbur&s;ed all the expences of his armament, and allowed a yearly pen&s;ion, by Charles: but the no|bility and officers, who &s;old or mortgaged their e&s;tates, in hopes of preferment, murmured very much.</P>
<PB N="330" REF="365">
<P>A.

He was not igno|rant of the people's di&s;content, and fore&s;aw the &s;torm to which he was afterwards expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>A new pretender to the crown of England,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Account of Perkin Warbeck.</NOTE> much more dangerous than Lambert Simnel, had appeared on the continent, under the name of Richard Plantagenet Duke of York, &s;econd &s;on of Edward IV. &s;uppo&s;ed to have e&s;caped from the Tower, after the death of his elder brother, Edward V. This claimant (whom the adherents of Henry alledged to be the &s;on of a converted Jew in Tourney, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Perkin Warbeck) was a youth of very engaging a&s;pect, courteous addre&s;s, and of great accompli&s;hments both of body and un|der&s;tanding. He was patronized by Edward VI.'s &s;i&s;ter, Margaret Duche&s;s of Burgundy, who, when Henry VII. declared war again&s;t France, de&s;ired him to take &s;hipping for Ireland, which was devoted to the hou&s;e of York. He followed her directions, and land|ing at Cork, was joined by a great number of parti|&s;ans. Charles VIII. was no &s;ooner informed of his being there, than he &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to a&s;&s;ure him of his protection, and invite him to his court. On his arrival at Paris he was honourably received, acknow|ledged Duke of York, accommodated in a princely manner, till the peace of E&s;taples, when Henry tried to per&s;uade the French King to deliver him up: but that Monarch would not violate the laws of ho&s;pi|tality, though he promi&s;ed that the youth &s;hould have no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from France in &s;upport of his claim to the Engli&s;h throne. The adventurer then repaired
<PB N="331" REF="366">to the court of the Duche&s;s of Burgundy, where he gave &s;uch pertinent an&s;wers to the minute&s;t que&s;tions propo&s;ed to him, and demeaned him&s;elf with &s;uch dig|nity of deportment, that &s;he, and all the &s;pectators, &s;eemed fully convinced of his being the real Duke of York.

<P>In the mean time Henry was not idle: he employed emi&s;&s;aries abroad to in&s;inuate them&s;elves into the con|duct of the pretender and his protectre&s;s, that they might di&s;cover the particulars of his birth and education, as well as the names of tho&s;e who favoured him in Eng|land. That tho&s;e &s;pies might be the le&s;s &s;u&s;pected, he cau&s;ed them to be excommunicated at St. Paul's by name, in the bead-roll of his enemies, according to the cu&s;tom of the times: nay, he even tampered with the chaplains and confe&s;&s;ors of the nobility, in order to know their &s;ecret inclinations. He was no le&s;s indu&s;|trious in endeavouring to find out proofs of the Duke of York's having been murdered in the Tower. Sir James Tyrrel, and his &s;ervant Dighton, were examin|ed, and confe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves the perpetrators of that alledged tragedy; but, however, their account left the matter in &s;uch perplexity, that Henry never made u&s;e of it in any of his declarations. Dighton was &s;et at li|berty, and earned his pardon by divulging this tradi|tion, which in all probability was invented for Henry's purpo&s;e: and very little dependance ought to be laid
<PB N="332" REF="367">on extorted confe&s;&s;ions, as well as on the writers of this reign, who had their information, concerning this dark affair, in &s;uch incoherent &s;craps as the King was plea&s;ed to give them; and generally made their court, by blackening his predece&s;&s;or, who was otherwi&s;e cri|minal enough. All the intelligence that Henry could get from abroad, was &s;o defective, and ill atte&s;ted, that, in&s;tead of convincing the world of an impo&s;ture, it confirmed the opinion of many in favour of the youth called Perkin Warbeck. They concluded, from Henry's known &s;agacity, that if the young man had really been an impo&s;tor, he would have traced him from his cradle to his appearance in the character of Richard Plantagenet, in &s;uch a manner, as would have plainly detected the deceit. They could hardly believe, that Charles VIII. King of France, and the Duche&s;s of Burgundy, would have pro&s;tituted the dignity of Princes &s;o far, as to be&s;tow it upon a com|mon adventurer; and they took it for granted, that if the Duke of York had been actually murdered in the Tower, King Henry would have been able to prove the fact &s;o clearly, as to confute the preten&s;ions of any counterfeit. There was &s;omething very my&s;terious in Henry's conduct upon this occa&s;ion: for the informa|tion, which he alledged to have received from his &s;pies abroad, touching the life and adventures of Perkin, was not publi&s;hed by proclamation, or in any other authentic manner; but circulated in vague and con|tradictory reports by the courtiers and their adherents. His amba&s;&s;ador at the court of the Archduke, when de&s;ired to produce the evidence of the Duke of York's death, &s;aid, his ma&s;ter declined that fort of proof, be|cau&s;e it might be alledged that he had tutored the wit|ne&s;&s;es. The&s;e circum&s;tances, added to the uncommon jealou&s;y he manife&s;ted towards the pretender, the great pains he took, and the &s;ums, which, contrary to his nature, he expended, in countermining the efforts of the claimant, per&s;uaded many people, that the youth was

What augmented their fear, was their perceiving that Henry had maintained &s;pies to watch the conduct of the Lord Chamberlain; and, in all probability, followed the &s;ame practice with other noblemen, who dur&s;t no longer communicate their &s;entiments, le&s;t tho&s;e, whom they tru&s;ted as friends, &s;hould prove informers.&mdash;In &s;ummer, King Henry, in order to convince the na|tion, that the proceedings again&s;t Sir William Stanley had not dimini&s;hed his regard for his brother the Earl of Derby, or his affection for his own mother the wife of that nobleman, made an excur&s;ion to the Earl's hou&s;e at Latham in Lanca&s;hire, where he &s;taid three days, and &s;eemed well plea&s;ed with his entertainment. From thence he made a progre&s;s through York&s;hire: and while he was at this di&s;tance from the capital,
<PB N="336" REF="371">his rival re&s;olved to try his fortune in England. Being &s;upplied with &s;ome troops and ve&s;&s;els by the Duche&s;s of Burgundy, he &s;e$ &s;a$l in July, and arriving on the coa&s;t of Kent, near Sandwich, landed &s;ome of his people, to &s;ound the inclinations of the natives, whom they endeavoured to cajole, by a&s;&s;uring them that there was $word$ &s;trong armament fitted out in Flanders for &s;upporting the title of the Duke of York: but the Kenti&s;hmen ob&s;erving they were all foreigners and freebooters, in&s;tead of joining them, con&s;ulted the gentlemen of the county, who advi&s;ed them to allure the adventurer a&s;hore, and then &s;ecure his per&s;on. They accordingly took to their arms, and marching to the &s;ea-&s;ide, invited him to land; which he was inclined to comply with, till di&s;&s;uaded by his &s;ecretary Frion, who concluded they were part of Henry's forces; and the&s;e, finding them&s;elves di&s;appointed, put all tho&s;e to the &s;word, except about 160, who were afterwards hanged in different parts of the coa&s;t by the King's order.

<P>Henry, upon his return from his northern tour, a&s;&s;embled a parliament in October; which, among other laws, enacted that famous &s;tature, ordaining, That no per&s;on a&s;&s;i&s;ting, in arms or otherwi&s;e, the King for the time being, &s;hould be afterwards called to account, or attainted on that accu&s;ation. This &s;tatute appears at fir&s;t &s;ight to have been enacted in favour of the people<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 296.</NOTE>: but was, in reality, calcu|lated to hinder individuals from prying too narrowly into Henry's title, which they would have the le&s;s oc|ca&s;ion to examine &s;trictly, as this provi&s;ion was &s;eem|ingly made for their &s;afety.</P>
<P>During the &s;e&s;&s;ion of this parliament, Henry was informed, that Perkin had landed in Ireland; but
<PB N="337" REF="372">&s;uch mea&s;ures had been taken, that no per&s;on of con|&s;equence declared for him; and therefore he was ad|vi&s;ed to &s;ail for Scotland, and &s;olicit &s;uccour from James IV. King of that country, who was upon very indifferent terms with Henry, and had probably agreed to a&s;&s;i&s;t him at the mediation of the Duche&s;s of Bur|gundy, before he &s;ailed from Flanders.

James being a&s;&s;ured that the Engli&s;h would declare for the claimant in great numbers, as &s;oon as he &s;hould appear in that kingdom properly attended, rai&s;ed a numerous army, which he conducted into Northumberland, accompa|nied by the pretender. There he publi&s;hed a mani|fe&s;to, inveighing again&s;t Henry as an u&s;urper, tyrant, and murderer; and promi&s;ed honours and advantages to tho&s;e who &s;hould join their lawful Prince, and help to de&s;troy the robber who had deprived him of his throne. This &s;pirited remon&s;trance had very little effect upon the Engli&s;h, who were nationally aver&s;e to the Scots, and by this time &s;o intimidated by the &s;uc|ce&s;s and &s;everity of the reigning King, that they would no longer ri&s;que their lives and fortunes in behalf of a &s;tranger, even though they believed him to be the &s;on of Edward: and James, &s;eeing no hopes of being join|ed by the Engli&s;h, returned to his own country<NOTE PLACE="&Dagger;">Ibid. vol. v. p. 301.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>A.

He obtained an ample &s;upply, and then di&s;&s;olved the a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>He did not at all doubt of the &s;ucce&s;s of his nego|tiation with Scotland; and therefore, that he might have the &s;ub&s;idy in his coffers before the peace &s;hould be concluded, he ordered it to be collected with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch. This taxation occa&s;ioned a commo|tion in Cornwall, fomented at fir&s;t in Bodmin, by Michael Jo&s;eph, a popular black&s;mith, and Thomas Flammock, a turbulent lawyer; and at la&s;t headed by Lord Audeley, who conducted 16,000 in&s;urgents to Blackheath, in Kent, where they were totally routed on June 22<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 303.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>While Henry was employed in quelling this rebel|lion, the Scotti&s;h King made a &s;econd irruption into England; but not being joined by the partizans of the hou&s;e of York, and a numerous army advancing again&s;t him under the Earl of Surry, he retired into his own kingdom, whither he was pur&s;ued by the Engli&s;h ge|neral, who took the ca&s;tle of Ayton, a &s;ew miles from Berwick.</P>
<P>Several con&s;iderations induced Henry to de&s;ire a peace with James; but was afraid to make the fir&s;t overtures, le&s;t he &s;hould meet with a repul&s;e. He,
<PB N="339" REF="376">therefore, prevailed on the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador to vi&s;it the court of Scotland, and as from him&s;elf propo&s;e an accommodation. That mini&s;ter executed his commi&s;|&s;ion with &s;uch addre&s;s, that a congre&s;s was opened at Ayton, under his mediation. The greate&s;t difficulty was about Perkin, whom Henry demanded, and whom James po&s;itively refu&s;ed to deliver. At length it was agreed, that James &s;hould di&s;mi&s;s the claimant, and then proceed with the negotiation, as if he had never been in Scotland. In pur&s;uance of this convention, the Scotti&s;h Monarch told the adventurer, that he had done every thing in his power to &s;upport him in his preten&s;ions; that he had twice entered England at the head of an army; but that, as the Engli&s;h had de|clined e&s;pou&s;ing his cau&s;e, he could not expect that the Scots would, without their concurrence, be able to e&s;tabli&s;h him on the throne of England. He therefore advi&s;ed him to form &s;ome more &s;ea&s;ible plan, and chu&s;e &s;ome other country for his place of re&s;idence: at the &s;ame time he a&s;&s;ured him, that he would punctually ful|fil his promi&s;e; that he &s;hould not repent of having put him&s;elf into his hands; for he &s;hould be honoura|bly accommodated with &s;hips and nece&s;&s;aries for his voyage. The youth bore his misfortune with a good grace; thanked the King of Scotland for the protec|tion and other favours he had enjoyed from his bounty; and de&s;ired that he and his wife might be conveyed to Ireland. James complied with his reque&s;t; and he arrived at Cork, where he &s;till found friends and adhe|rents.

<P>A. D. 1498.] Although the King of England had nothing to fear from foreign enemies, he was once more expo&s;ed to the danger of a dome&s;tic in&s;urrection. His clemency to the Corni&s;h in&s;urgents, who had paid two or three &s;hillings each for their ran&s;om, was re|pre&s;ented
<PB N="340" REF="377">by them at their return, as not owing to his mercy, but his apprehen&s;ion of his own &s;ubjects, three-fourths of whom were of the &s;ame &s;entiments with the Corni&s;hmen. The&s;e in&s;inuations per&s;uading their friends and neighbours that the whole kingdom was ripe for revolt, &s;ome of the mo&s;t zealous again&s;t the government concerted mea&s;ures for a fre&s;h commotion; and as they propo&s;ed that Perkin &s;hould be their leader, they &s;ent a deputation to tell him, that if he would re|pair to Cornwall, he would find con&s;iderable &s;uccours, which, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his other well-wi&s;hers, would, in all probability, place him on the throne of England. As he was without re&s;ource, he accepted the invitation, and forthwith embarking with about &s;eventy followers, in four &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, arrived at Whit&s;and-bay, whence he proceeded to Bodmin. Be|ing joined there by about 3000 men, he a&s;&s;umed the title of Richard IV. King of England; and publi&s;hed a proclamation, exhorting the people to take up arms, in order to depo&s;e Henry Tudor, the u&s;urper. He then made an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt upon Exeter, with the lo&s;s of 200 of his followers: and relinqui&s;hing the enterpri&s;e, upon notice that his antagoni&s;t was ad|vancing again&s;t him with numerous forces, marched to Taunton, where he declared he would hazard an engagement; but dreading to fall into Henry's hands, he withdrew in the night, with &s;ome of his confidents, to the &s;anctuary of Beaulieu, in the New Fore&s;t, which was &s;oon be&s;et by a party of the King's army. In the mean time the in&s;urgents, to the number of 6000, finding them&s;elves without a leader, &s;ubmitted to their adver&s;aries. A detachment of cavalry was &s;ent to St. Michael's Mount, to &s;ecure Perkin's wife; Henry fore&s;eeing that if &s;he was pregnant, the conte&s;t might be continued to another generation. When that Lady was brought into the King's pre&s;ence, he was &s;o &s;truck with her beauty and mode&s;t deportment, that he con|&s;oled her in very affectionate terms, with promi&s;e of
<PB N="341" REF="378">protection, &s;ent her under a &s;trong guard to attend upon the Queen, and be&s;towed upon her a con&s;iderable pen&s;ion, which &s;he enjoyed during his life, and many years afterwards. It was in this expedition that Henry pre&s;ented his &s;word to the Mayor of Exeter, to be carried before that Magi&s;trate, for the defence the citizens had made in behalf of his government *.</P>
<P>The di&s;turbance being effectually quelled, the fate of Perkin came under con&s;ideration, and it was deter|mined that the King &s;hould pardon him, on condition of his confe&s;&s;ing and explaining every circum&s;tance of his long a&s;&s;umed character. His affairs being then de&s;perate, he embraced the offer without he&s;itation, and quitted the &s;anctuary. Henry being de&s;irous of &s;eeing him, he was brought to court, where the King viewed him from a window, but would never admit him into his pre&s;ence. He was afterwards conducted to London, and by Henry's order rode in public thro' the &s;treets from We&s;tmin&s;ter to the Tower, and back again, amid&s;t the in&s;ults of the populace, which he bore with the mo&s;t dignified re&s;ignation. Then he was confined in the Tower, and &s;igned a confe&s;&s;ion, which was printed and di&s;per&s;ed through the nation: but this was &s;o lame, defective, and contradictory, that, in&s;tead of explaining the pretended impo&s;ture, it left it more doubtful than before, and induced many people to be|lieve that Perkin Warbeck was really the &s;on of Ed|ward IV<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 312.</NOTE>.</P>

Perkin, who doubtle&s;s felt that de&s;ire of liberty which is &s;o natural to the mind of man, and had rea&s;on to $$$d the wor&s;t from Henry's di&s;po&s;ition, was permitted to conver&s;e wit$ the haple&s;s Warwick, as well as the dome&s;tics of Lord Digby, Lieutenant of the Tower: and in all probab$lity he was indulged with this permi&s;&s;ion by the connivance of the King, in hopes that his enterpri&s;ing genius, and in&s;inuating addre&s;s, would engage the unde&s;igning Warwick in &s;ome project that would furni&s;h a pretext for taking away their lives under colour of ju&s;tice. Perkin fell into the &s;$are, according to Henry's expectation: he tampered with War|wick, and gained over four &s;ervants of Digby, who are &s;aid to have undertaken the murder of their ma&s;ter, that they might &s;ecure the keys of the Tower, and e&s;cape with the two pri&s;oners to &s;ome part of the kingdom where a new in&s;urrection might be rai&s;ed in favour of the Pretender. That the danger might appear the more imminent and pre&s;&s;ing, &s;o as to ju&s;tify the &s;teps which Henry intended to take, another di&s;turbance was rai&s;ed at the &s;ame time in Kent, where a young man called Ralph Wilford, the &s;on of a cordwainer, per&s;onated the Earl of Warwick, under the conduct and direction of one Patrick, an Augu&s;tine monk, who in public &s;erm$ns exhorted the people to take arms in his favour. This Patrick, who had been u&s;ed as a tool by the King's emi&s;&s;aries, was arre&s;ted, together with his pupil; and Wilford was hanged without ceremony, but the tutor obtained his pardon. This was the prelude to the fate of Perkin and the Earl of Warwick, who&s;e pretended plot being now di&s;covered, Perkin was tried at We&s;tmin&s;ter, and being convicted on the evidence of Lord Digby's &s;ervants, was, on November 16, hanged at Tyburn, with John Walter, Mayor of Cork, who had con&s;tantly adhered to him in all the vici&s;&s;itudes of his fortune. Blewet and A&s;twood, two of Digby's &s;ervants, underwent the &s;ame fate; but &s;ix other per&s;ons, condemned as accomplices in the &s;ame con&s;piracy, were pard$ned. In a few days after Perkin's execution, the &s;imple Earl of Warwick was tried by his p$er, and being convicted, in con&s;e|quence of his pleading guilty to the arraignment, was beheaded on Tower-hill, on the 28th. The deplorable end of this innocent nobleman, the la&s;t male branch of the royal Plantagenets, and the fate of Perkin Warbeck, who, notwith&s;tanding all that appeared again&s;t him, was by the unprejudiced part of the nation deemed the real &s;on of King Edward IV. filled the whole kingdom with &s;uch horror and aver&s;ion to the government of Henry, that he was fain to tran&s;late the odium upon his ally Ferdinand, by divulging that Prince's &s;cruples.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>The year 1500 produced a great plague in England, and an interview between King Henry and the Archduke Philip at Calais. It is al&s;o memorable for the conti|nuation of Henry's rapacious methods of gratifying his avarice. As he had no pretence for demanding &s;ub&s;idies from parliament, he re&s;olved to drain the party of Warbeck, until they &s;hould be quite ex|hau&s;ted. On the &s;uppo&s;ition that the adherents of this pretender were &s;till liable to the rigour of the law, notwith&s;tanding they had been all forgiven, except a few of the ringleaders who were hanged, he in&s;i&s;ted upon their being indulged with &s;eparate pardons, which they did not at all &s;olicit; and compelled them to pay largely for this indulgence. He appointed commi&s;|&s;ioners to &s;et on foot a new enquiry about tho&s;e who had in any manner a&s;&s;i&s;ted or favoured the revolt of the Lord Audeley (all who&s;e &s;urviving followers, ex|cept Jo&s;eph and Flammock, were pardoned by pro|clamation) and the cau&s;e of Perkin.

For the&s;e fordid purpo&s;es, he retained two infamous mini&s;ters called Emp&s;om and Dudley, who followed the pro&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the law, and practi&s;ed it in all its &s;ubterfuges and chicanery, in oppre&s;&s;ing the &s;ubjects with fal&s;e ac|cu&s;ations and impri&s;onment, until they were fain to

<P>He let &s;lip no opportunity of ama&s;&s;ing money, how&s;oever mean or ungrateful it might be. One day, when he was magnificently entertained by the Earl of Oxford, to who&s;e &s;ervices he was in a great mea&s;ure in|debted for the crown, he perceived a greater number of do|me&s;tics in livery than the law allowed him to maintain; and turning to the Earl, "My Lord (&s;aid he) I have heard much of your ho&s;pitality; but it exceeds report. Are all the&s;e gentlemen and yeomen your menial &s;er|vants?" Oxford an&s;wering that they were retained upon &s;uch extraordinary occa&s;ions only, Henry affected &s;urpri&s;e, and replied with &s;ome warmth, "By my faith! my Lord, I thank you for my good cheer; but I may not endure to have my laws broken in my &s;ight: my attorney mu&s;t &s;peak with you." The Earl was obliged to compound for this mi&s;demeanor by the payment of 15,000 marks<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 322.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Such conduct in the King and his mini&s;ters could not fail to render them extremely odious to the people, who murmured ince&s;&s;antly again&s;t the government; and this di&s;content encouraged Edmond de la Pole Earl of Suffolk, who&s;e fortune was greatly reduced by his own extravagance, to pro&s;ecute his projects again&s;t the government. He was nephew to Edward IV. and about two years before having been affronted by
<PB N="346" REF="383">the King, retired in di&s;gu&s;t to the court of his aunt the Duche&s;s of Burgundy; but was per&s;uaded to re|turn and be reconciled to Henry. He had acquired a degree of popularity as being a branch of the hou&s;e of York: he privately engaged &s;ome per&s;ons of con|&s;ideration in his intere&s;t; and then made another vi&s;it to Flanders, in hopes of receiving countenance and &s;uccour from his aunt. The King, alarmed at his re|treat, and eager to know his &s;cheme, with the names of his a&s;&s;ociates, repeated the expedient he had u&s;ed in the ca&s;e of the youth, commonly called Perkin Warbeck. Sir Robert Cur&s;on, governor of the ca&s;tle of Hammes, being properly in&s;tructed, abandoned his charge on pretence of having been injured by Henry. He acted his part with &s;uch dexterity, that in a &s;hort time he in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the Earl's confidence, and di&s;covered all his a&s;&s;ociates. The in|telligence was forthwith communicated to the King, who immediately i&s;&s;ued warrants for apprehending the principal con&s;pirators, &s;ome of whom were executed. Henry, willing to be more fully informed touching the particulars of the de&s;igns of the Earl of Suffolk, took a very extraordinary method to maintain Cur&s;on in the confidence of that nobleman. He cau&s;ed the bull of Pope Innocent VIII. denouncing the cen&s;ures of the church again&s;t all tho&s;e who &s;hould di&s;turb his government, to be publi&s;hed in St. Paul's church; and got the Earl of Suffolk and Sir Robert Cur&s;on to be excommunicated by name. When this emi&s;&s;ary had di&s;covered all the Earl's &s;ecrets, he returned to England, and was readmitted publickly into the King's favour, which, however, he did not enjoy without the cur&s;es of the people, who dete&s;ted his perfidy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 322.</NOTE>.</P>

Henry, neverthele&s;s, re&s;olved to detain his gue&s;t until he &s;hould deliver up the Earl of Suffolk, from who&s;e machinations he &s;till dreaded &s;ome trouble and di&s;quiet. He, therefore, told the Ca&s;tilian Mo|narch, with &s;ome emotion, "Sir, you have been &s;aved upon my coa&s;t, I hope you will not &s;uffer me to be wrecked on your's." When Philip de&s;ired to know the purport of that addre&s;s, Henry replied, "I mean that &s;ame hair-brained wild-fellow, my &s;ubject, the Earl of Suffolk, who is protected in your country, and begins to play the fool, when others are tired of the game." To this explanation the Ca&s;tilian an|&s;wered, "I thought your felicity had rai&s;ed you above all &s;uch apprehen&s;ions; but &s;ince you are unea&s;y at his re&s;iding in Flanders, I will bani&s;h him from my do|minions." The Engli&s;h Monarch expre&s;&s;ing a de&s;ire of having him in his power, Philip told him in &s;ome confu&s;ion, that he could not deliver him up with any regard to his own honour; and that &s;uch a &s;tep would be &s;till le&s;s for the reputation of Henry, as the world would imagine he had treated his gue&s;t as a pri&s;oner. "I will take that di&s;grace upon my&s;elf (&s;aid the King) and &s;o your honour will be &s;aved." The other, &s;eeing that he would not be denied, compo&s;ed his counte|nance, &s;aying, "Sir, you give law to me, and I will dictate to you in my turn: Suffolk &s;hall be delivered up; but you will give me your honour that his life &s;hall be &s;afe." Henry agreeing to the propo&s;al, Philip wrote a letter to Suffolk, a&s;&s;uring him that he had ob|tained his pardon; and the King confirming this a&s;&s;er|tion by another me&s;&s;age, that nobleman returned to his own country, and was committed clo&s;e pri&s;oner to the Tower: but Henry VIII, without regard to his

<P>Among the remarkable per&s;ons of this reign,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Some account of Dean Colet.</NOTE> was Dr. John Colet, the elde&s;t and only &s;urviving child of Sir Henry Colet, mercer, twice Lord Mayor of London, who, with his ten &s;ons, and as many daughters, was depicted on a gla&s;s-window in the church of St. Antolin, in Lon|don, to which he was a benefactor. Dr. Colet was educated in the univer&s;ity of Oxford; and afterwards, for his further improvement, travelled into France and Italy. Upon his return he &s;tudied the &s;criptures, and expounded St. Paul's epi&s;tles publickly at Oxford. He was pre&s;ented by Henry VII. to the deanery of St. Paul's cathedral; and as he had early imbibed a liking to the doctrines of Wickliffe, he was always a protec|tor of tho&s;e called Lollards, and &s;aved the life of one by his interpo&s;ition with the King. In his &s;ermons he maintained, <HI>That images &s;hould not be wor&s;hipped, and that clerks &s;hould not be covetous.</HI> Two friars, named Bricot and Standi&s;h, accu&s;ed him of here&s;y unto Ri|chard Fitz-James, Bi&s;hop of London, who charged him with the &s;ame crime to William Warham, Arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury. But that Primate, well know|ing the Dean's worth and integrity, from a judge be|came his advocate; defended and patronized him, and would not give him the trouble of putting in any for|mal an&s;wer. It is al&s;o &s;aid, that the Bi&s;hop endeavour|ed to repre&s;ent Dr. Colet as an heretic, for tran&s;lating the <HI>paier-no&s;ter</HI> into Engli&s;h; but the Archbi&s;hop in|terpo&s;ed. The Dean's troubles, on account of his re|ligious &s;entiments, increa&s;ed his charity and devotion. He had a plentiful fortune, and re&s;olved to dedicate it to &s;ome permanent benefaction in his own time. Churches, mona&s;teries, religious hou&s;es, and chaun|tries, had long been in England the objects of public charity, which then began to be rather applied to the
<PB N="355" REF="392">erecting of colleges, and providing for &s;tudents at the univer&s;ities. Learning was brought out of Italy, and greatly diffu&s;ed by the art of printing. Dr. Colet rightly judged that the re&s;toration of learning would be much promoted by the endowment of a grammar-&s;chool for the in&s;truction of youth in the Latin and Greek languages, the ba&s;is of cla&s;&s;ical literature, as well as of the &s;tudy of divinity; and conceived, that, by being the founder of &s;uch a &s;chool, he &s;hould pro|vide an excellent nur&s;ery for the two univer&s;ities. For that end he erected a noble &s;tructure at the ea&s;t-end of St. Paul's church-yard in the city of London, at the expence of 4500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> be&s;ides what he allotted for the free education of one hundred and fifty-three youths, poor mens children, and for hand&s;ome &s;alaries to the ma&s;ters; the two fir&s;t of whom were William Lily, the noted grammarian, and John Wrighthou&s;e, both men of capacity and diligence. He likewi&s;e e&s;tabli&s;h|ed rules for the conduct of the ma&s;ters, as well as the &s;tudents, and committed the charge of the whole to the mercers company. Era&s;mus &s;ays, Dean Colet laid out a great part of his inheritance in building St. Paul's &s;chool, which was a magnificent fabric, dedicated to the child Je&s;us. Two dwelling-hou&s;es were added for the accommodation of the two ma&s;ters, for whom ample provi&s;ion was made. The &s;chool was divided into four apartments: the boys had their di&s;tinct forms, one above the other, and every form held &s;ixteen. The pious founder would admit no partner in the expence: and after he had fini&s;hed his foundation, he granted the perpetual care, government, and &s;uperintendency of the e&s;tate, not to the clergy, Bi&s;hop, the chapter, or any great mini&s;ter at court, but to married citizens of probity and reputation. When he was a&s;ked the cau&s;e of &s;o doing, he an&s;wered, there was no certainty in human affairs, but he found le&s;s corruption in &s;uch a body of citizens than in any other body of men.

<P>This ejectment of Wickliffe from his warden&s;hip was no injury to his reputation, and he was &s;oon after pre&s;ented by the &s;aid Duke to the rectory of Lutterworth, in the county of Leice&s;ter, and dioce&s;e of Lincoln.</P>

A long bill was brought into parliament again&s;t the Papal u&s;urpations, remon|&s;trating that five times as much was paid to the Pope as to the King: and Dr. Wickliffe, now more &s;en&s;i|ble of the pride, avarice, ambition, and tyranny of the Pope than ever, made them the &s;ubject of his pub|lic lectures; &s;hewing, that God had given his &s;heep to the Pope to be pa&s;tured, but not fleeced; and even called him Antichri&s;t.</P>
<P>But Wickliffe &s;ufficiently felt the hatred and per&s;e|cution of tho&s;e whom he endeavoured to reform. The monks complained to the Pope, that Wickliffe oppo&s;ed his powers, and defended the royal &s;upremacy.</P>
<P>This accu&s;ation highly incen&s;ed the Pope, and great|ly alarmed the court of Rome; and Pope Gregory XI. &s;ent forth &s;everal bulls again&s;t Wickliffe, dated May 22, 1377. One was directed to Simon Sudbury, Arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury, and William Courteney, Bi&s;hop of London, whom he delegated to examine into the matter of complaint; acquainting them, that Wick|liffe had ra&s;hly a&s;&s;erted, and publickly preached, &s;uch dete&s;table erroneous propo&s;itions as were contrary to the faith, and threatened to &s;ubvert and weaken the cau&s;e of the whole church. Another bull was directed to the Chancellor, Vice-chancellor, &amp;c. of the univer|&s;ity of Oxford.

A third bull was &s;ent to the King him&s;elf, reque&s;ting his patronage and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Bi&s;hops in the pro&s;ecution of Wickliffe.</P>
<PB N="361" REF="400">
<P>King Edward died before the &s;aid bull reached Eng|land. The univer&s;ity treated their bull with contempt. The Duke of Lanca&s;ter, and Henry Piercy, Lord Mar|&s;hal, declared they would not &s;uffer him to be impri|&s;oned, without the royal con&s;ent: however, the dele|gated prelates i&s;&s;ued forth their mandate to cite Wick|liffe before them, within thirty days, at St. Paul's in London.</P>
<P>Before that day came, the fir&s;t parliament of King Richard II. met at We&s;tmin&s;ter, where it was debated, whether they might lawfully refu&s;e &s;ending the trea|&s;ure out of the kingdom, which the Pope had demand|ed on pain of cen&s;ure. The matter was referred to Dr. Wickliffe, who an&s;wered, that it was lawful, and that he would prove it by the laws of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Wickliffe appeared to the &s;ummons of the delegated Bi&s;hops at St. Paul's, where a va&s;t concour&s;e of peo|ple a&s;&s;embled to hear the examination. The Doctor was attended by the Duke of Lanca&s;ter, and the Lord Mar&s;hal, who&s;e countenance contributed to his for|titude; for the manner of their introducing him was rather like to a triumph than a trial. This piqued the Bi&s;hop of London, who told the Lord Mar&s;hal, if he had known what ma&s;teries they would have kept in the church, he would have &s;topped them from coming there.</P>
<P>When Wickliffe was ordered to attend to his charge, he &s;tood up before the Commi&s;&s;ioners, according to cu&s;tom; but the Lord Mar&s;hal, then Earl of Northum|berland, bid him &s;it down, as he had many things to an&s;wer, and had need of a &s;oft &s;eat to re&s;t him&s;elf upon. The Bi&s;hop of London objected to it; but the Duke of Lanca&s;ter immediately replied, that he hoped &s;hortly to bring down the pride of all the pre|lates of the kingdom; and other irritating expre&s;&s;ions were interchanged, which occa&s;ioned &s;ome commotion in the court. The Londoners declating they would re&s;ent any in&s;ults to their Bi&s;hop, the nobility, &s;ome|what

<P>The Duke of Lanca&s;ter being at this time Pre&s;ident of the Council, the Bi&s;hops were afraid to offend the avowed protector of Wickliffe. However, the pre|lates &s;ummoned the Doctor before them a &s;econd time at Lambeth; where he attended, and profe&s;&s;ing a de|&s;ire to give them any rea&s;onable &s;atisfaction, delivered a paper, explaining the &s;everal articles with which he was charged<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">The three capital po&s;itions which gave the greate&s;t offence, were, That dominion was founded on grace; that the temporal power might &s;eize on the patrimony of the church; and that no eccle&s;ia&s;tic ought to be ve&s;ted with a coercive power.</NOTE>: but this was not &s;o ample and clear as they expected or required.

<P>But the death of Pope Gregory XI.

<P>Many of the nobility and clergy adhered to the opi|nions of Wickliffe, and &s;ome of the latter defended him in the convocation. Dr. Hereford took a jour|ney to Rome, and offered, in a con&s;i&s;tory before the Pope, to defend the conclu&s;ions lately condemned by the Archbi&s;hop, who committed him to pri&s;on on his return to England. That primate ordered the con|demnation of Dr. Wickliffe's opinions to be publi&s;hed in the univer&s;ity; whereupon the Doctor declined, or was excluded from his profe&s;&s;or&s;hip, and retired to Lutterworth, where he &s;till vindicated his doctrine, and ju&s;tified his followers.</P>
<P>The next year, 1383, the Pope &s;ummoned him to appear at Rome<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Knighton.</NOTE>, and an&s;wer for his here&s;ies.

<P>Indeed the Kings and parliaments had, at certain opportunities, given many &s;ucce&s;sful blows to the Pa|pal power in England: and the doctrines of Wickliffe, Colet, and other reformers, even before a general re|formation was practicable, had di&s;po&s;ed the minds of the people for it.</P>

<P>King Henry VIII. was born at Greenwich on June 28, 1491. He very early appeared to be of an active, warm &s;pirit; and the advantage of an academical education, in many of the ab&s;tru&s;e parts of learning, gave him &s;uch an opinion of him&s;elf, that it had too much influence on the actions of his life. He &s;uc|ceeded to the crown as the indi&s;putably lawful and rightful heir at the age of eighteen. King Henry VII. in 1503, had affianced him to the Prince&s;s Catherine of Arragon<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">See before, p. 346.</NOTE>, his brother's widow. When the coun|cil

<P>Upon the death of the Emperor Maximilian, the Sovereigns of France and Spain openly declared them|&s;elves
<PB N="377" REF="416">competitors for the imperial throne; and the King of England, who had been flattered, in 1517, with the hopes of attaining that dignity, al&s;o tried his intere&s;t among the electors; but his application was ineffectual, and the Spani&s;h Monarch was elected, in the room of his grandfather, by the name of Charles V. This produced a variance between the new Em|peror and his rival Francis I. who both deemed the friend&s;hip of Henry nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ucce&s;s of their re&s;pective de&s;igns; and as they knew that he was ab|&s;olutely ruled by the pa&s;&s;ions and caprice of his mini|&s;ter, they courted the good graces of Wol&s;ey with the utmo&s;t a&s;&s;iduity. Be&s;ides pre&s;ents and pen&s;ions offered to this minion, they vied with each other in care&s;&s;ing him with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t adulation, calling him, in their letters, their Friend, their Patron, and their Father; and extolling his virtue, prudence, and capacity, in the mo&s;t hyperbolical expre&s;&s;ions. The Cardinal cun|ningly made u&s;e of the&s;e te&s;timonies, not only to flat|ter his ma&s;ter's vanity, by repre&s;enting how formidable he mu&s;t be to tho&s;e two potentates, who &s;tooped &s;o low as to court the favour of his &s;ervant, but likewi&s;e to enhance his own merit in the opinion of his Sovereign, who could not help ob&s;erving, that Wol&s;ey's parts mu&s;t be greatly &s;uperior to tho&s;e of all the other cour|tiers, when thus acknowledged by the greate&s;t Princes of Chri&s;tendom. Henry actually looked upon him&s;elf as the arbiter of Europe; and remained &s;o fully con|vinced of the Cardinal's capacity, that he &s;aw nothing but with his eyes, and was in every thing directed &s;olely by his advice. Wol&s;ey had now attained the highe&s;t &s;ummit of fortune: he was Favourite, Prime|mini&s;ter, Lord High Chancellor, Admini&s;trator of the See of Bath and Wells, Archbi&s;hop of York, Car|dinal, and Legate <HI>&agrave; latere.</HI> He received annual pen|&s;ions from the Emperor and the King of France; drew immen&s;e profits from the office of chancellor, by means of privileges lately annexed to it: and the King
<PB N="378" REF="417">not only loaded him with rich pre&s;ents, but al&s;o fur|ni&s;hed him with a great number of opportunities to in|crea&s;e his revenues.

<P>Wol&s;ey was &s;o intoxicated with this flow of pro&s;pe|rity, that his pride and arrogance &s;urmounted all bounds. He could no longer bear equality in his le|gation; and therefore prevailed upon the Pope to recal Cardinal Laurentius Campejus, who had been &s;ome time before joined in that office with him, and leave him inve&s;ted with the &s;ole legatine power. He then cele|brated ma&s;s as if he had been Pope in reality, attended by Bi&s;hops and Dukes, and Earls pre&s;ented him with the water and towel. He ordered the cro&s;s of York, and another for his legatine function, to be carried before him by two of the talle&s;t prie&s;ts that could be found. He erected a new court of judicature, called <HI>The Legate's court;</HI> in effect a court of con&s;cience, that almo&s;t took cognizance of all the actions of life: and one John Allen, who was appointed judge of this tri|bunal, acted with intolerable rapacity and extortion, on pretence of reforming the morals of the people. He pretended that his juri&s;diction extended to all &s;uits ari&s;ing from wills, and contracts of marriage; and tried an infinite number of cau&s;es, whil&s;t the King's judges dur&s;t not oppo&s;e this innovation. At the &s;ame time, the Cardinal Legate di&s;po&s;ed of all the benefices of the kingdom in favour of his own creatures, without pay|ing the lea&s;t regard to the rights of churches, mona&s;te|ries, or patrons. Archbi&s;hop Warham, at length, from a motive of con&s;cience, informed the King of
<PB N="379" REF="418">this oppre&s;&s;ion: and Henry, not only &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed at the Cardinal's in&s;olence, but de&s;ired the old Pri|mate to tell him, that he expected he would reform all tho&s;e abu&s;es. This remon&s;trance produced no other effect, than that of augmenting Wol&s;ey's hatred to the Archbi&s;hop. However, Allen, his agent, being af|terwards accu&s;ed by one John London, a &s;imple prie&s;t, the complaint reached the ears of the King, who re|primanded the Cardinal with &s;uch &s;everity, that he was more circum&s;pect in the &s;equel *.</P>
<P>The great wealth, power, and authority which he enjoyed in England, could not &s;atisfy his ambition, while there was one degree of eccle&s;ia&s;tical dignity which he had not yet attained. He had already begun to take mea&s;ures for obtaining the papacy, upon the fir&s;t vacancy; and the King of France had a&s;&s;ured him of the votes of fourteen Cardinals: but &s;ince Charles V. was cho&s;en Emperor, Wol&s;ey &s;eemed to think that Prince more capable of rai&s;ing him to the pontifical chair (though he was di&s;appointed on the death of Leo X. in 1521, when the Emperor's tutor, Adrian VI. was elected) and began gradually to wean his ma&s;ter from the intere&s;t of France, and engage him in behalf of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. Neverthele&s;s, he would not declare him&s;elf &s;o far as to prevent the intended in|terview between Henry and Francis; becau&s;e he could not prevail upon him&s;elf to re&s;ign the plea&s;ure of ap|pearing at the French court, with all the pomp of ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical magnificence, and of making his country|men witne&s;&s;es, of the honours and care&s;&s;es with which he expected to be treated, on that occa&s;ion, by the Gallic Monarch. However, he was re&s;olved to take &s;uch mea&s;ures as would hinder Francis from turning the interview to the prejudice of the Emperor, who at this period gained an incredible acce&s;&s;ion of wealth,<NOTE PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 396.</NOTE> by the

<P>A.

The King was &s;urpri&s;ed at Charles's arrival, which had been preconcerted between that Prince and the Cardinal, to whom he had pro|mi&s;ed his influence with the Pope towards procuring him the bi&s;hopric of Badajox. Wol&s;ey was &s;ent to compliment the Emperor at Dover, where the King waited on him next day, and conducted him to Can|terbury; whither al&s;o the Queen came to vi&s;it her nephew, whom &s;he had never &s;een. Charles's inten|tion, in this excur&s;ion, was to divert Henry from his purpo&s;ed interview with Francis: in which, however, he did not &s;ucceed, as the King of England thought he could not recede with honour; but, in all proba|bility, he gained the Cardinal entirely over to his in|tere&s;t, by promi&s;ing to &s;upport his de&s;igns upon the Papacy; and Henry a&s;&s;ured him, that he would never engage with the French King in any mea&s;ure that &s;hould be prejudicial to his Imperial Maje&s;ty. After having been &s;plendidly entertained during the holidays, he embarked at Sandwich for Flanders, very well &s;atisfied with the &s;ucce&s;s of his vi&s;it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. v. p. 398.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>A. D. 1521.] Luther's doctrine prevailing almo&s;t in every di&s;trict of Germany, the Emperor a&s;&s;embled a diet at Worms, to which that reformer was &s;ummon|ed, and appeared; but refu&s;ing to retract his tenets, was, with his favourers, pro&s;cribed by public edict. It then became fa&s;hionable for every zealous Papi&s;t to draw the pen again&s;t him: and the King of England imagined he could give no better proof of his zeal and learning, than by joining in the number; to which he conceived him&s;elf not a little provoked by Luther's having &s;poken contemptuou&s;ly of Thomas Aquinas, an author of great repute both with the King and Car|dinal. Henry, therefore, compiled a book, intitled, <HI>De Septem Sacramentis,</HI> wherein he &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;es Luther in point of indulgences, number of &s;acraments, papal authority, and other particulars, in which that reformer had oppo&s;ed the church of Rome; a copy of which performance, richly bound, was &s;ent to Leo. Lord Herbert &s;ays, the manner of delivery was upon record, and which he him&s;elf had &s;een in the Vatican library; and therefore relates as follows: "Dr. John Clarke, Dean of Wind&s;or, our King's Amba&s;&s;ador, appearing in full con&s;i&s;tory, the Pope, knowing the glorious pre&s;ent he brought, fir&s;t gave him his foot and then his cheeks to ki&s;s: then receiving the book, he promi&s;ed to do as much for the approbation thereof to all Chri&s;tian Princes, as was ever done for St. Augu&s;|tin's

<P>On the other hand, many of the books wrote by Luther, and others in Germany, were tran&s;lated into the Engli&s;h tongue; which many in England were di&s;|po&s;ed to read, and of con&s;equence &s;aw the ju&s;tice of many of the objections made to the principles and practices of the Roman church.</P>

<P>A. D. 1523.] The King having been, in the prece|ding year, involved in a needle&s;s war again&s;t France, in favour of the Emperor, by the intrigues of Wol|&s;ey, had attempted to rai&s;e money by oppre&s;&s;ive means; and finding the&s;e di&s;agreeable to the people, and un&s;ucce&s;sful, convened a parliament on April 15, when the Cardinal took care that the &s;piritual &s;hould have the lead. The bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ub&s;idy was brought into the convocation fir&s;t, where it was oppo&s;ed by Richard Fox, Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, John Fi&s;her, Bi|&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, and one Philips: but Wol&s;ey &s;ilen|cing &s;ome, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ing others, the re&s;t, intimidated by his great power and vindictive di&s;po&s;ition, agreed that one half of all eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues &s;hould be granted, payable in five years. From thence the Car|dinal went to the hou&s;e of Commons, where, in an

This extraordinary demand, though inforced by Sir Tho|mas More, the Speaker, met with great oppo&s;ition: yet at la&s;t the Commons re&s;olved, that every man po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of 20 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and upwards of yearly rent &s;hould pay 2 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> in the pound; the re&s;t, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing above 2 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;hould give 1 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> in the pound; and all under that &s;um, and above the age of &s;ixteen, &s;hould be taxed at 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> a head, to be paid in two years. Wol&s;ey, incen&s;ed at their rejecting his propo&s;al, repaired to the hou&s;e, and de&s;ired to hear their rea&s;ons for refu&s;ing his demands: but they an&s;wered, that they never argued in pre&s;ence of &s;trangers; and he retired, extremely chagrined at his repul&s;e. However, the Commons, to manife&s;t their zeal for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, voted a con&s;iderable addition to the &s;ub&s;idy<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lord Herbert, 136.

<P>Wol&s;ey was not &s;o much mortified at this check from the Commons, as at his &s;econd di&s;appointment with re&s;pect to the Papacy at the death of Adrian VI. who, to &s;oothe the Cardinal for his being put by the Papal chair, prolonged his legation for five years, and be&s;towed upon him the rich bi&s;hopric of Durham, in lieu of the &s;ee of Bath and Wells, which he re&s;igned. When Wol&s;ey had notice of Adrian's decea&s;e, he de|&s;ired the King to write a letter with his own hand to the Emperor, recommending him in the &s;tronge&s;t manner to the Papal dignity; but Charles had before taken his mea&s;ures in favour of Julius de Medicis, who was elected Pope, and a&s;&s;umed the name of Clement VII.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">See page 351 of this volume.</NOTE>. Though the Engli&s;h Cardinal affected to bear his di&s;appointment with a good grace, his heart pro|bably
<PB N="385" REF="426">glowed with revenge again&s;t the Emperor, which he then thought proper to di&s;&s;emble. However, he was &s;omewhat con&s;oled by Clement's conferring on him a perpetual grant of the legatine power, which had never been given for life upon any other occa|&s;ion<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In this year, the college of Phy&s;iciars in London was in&s;tituted, and endowed with divers privileges, by Henry VIII.; and Chri&s;tian II. King of Sweden and Denmark, who had been expelled for his cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion, vi&s;ited the court of England, whence he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with &s;ome valuable pre&s;ents. About the &s;ame time, Luther publi&s;hed an an&s;wer to the King of England's performance, and gave &s;uch offence to that Prince by his acrimonious &s;tile, that Henry com|plained to the Saxon Princes of Luther's in&s;olence, and de&s;ired them to prohibit him from publi&s;hing a tran&s;lation of the Bible in the High Dutch language: but his remon&s;trance produced very little effect.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A. D. 1524.] Wol&s;ey having thus, by the favour of the King and the Pope, obtained a kind of papal authority in England, he exerted it to the full, both with re&s;pect to civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs; pre&s;um|ing him&s;elf &s;afe, while he was pur&s;uing every method to &s;upply the King with money to &s;erve the purpo&s;es of his plea&s;ure and grandeur. Something of this ap|peared in his de&s;ign to build and endow two colleges, one at Oxford, and the other at Ip&s;wich, the place of his nativity, and have them put under &s;uch regulations as his Maje&s;ty and he &s;hould think proper. To facilitate this de&s;ign, letters were &s;ent to the Pope, intimating, that the invention of printing had been the means of introducing many heretical books, and of the great increa&s;e of here&s;y; and that common people could now read the &s;criptures, and under&s;tand prayers, in their native language, which tended to a di&s;parage|ment of the clergy. To prevent the&s;e and &s;uch like con&s;equences, it was humbly propo&s;ed to the pontiff, that the erecting of colleges, and placing per&s;ons of letters as public pro&s;e&s;&s;ors therein, would be the be&s;t expedient. This was highly approved by the Pope, and permi&s;&s;ion given to &s;uppre&s;s &s;ome of the mona|&s;teries,
<PB N="386" REF="427">as there was great want of learned per&s;ons in them, and apply their revenues to the building of the two colleges. Little more was nece&s;&s;ary for the Cardi|nal, than to repre&s;ent to the King how fit it was that &s;o learned a Prince &s;hould promote literature, and maintain that faith whereof the Pope had made him defender. Yet, becau&s;e the wars had &s;o much ex|hau&s;ted his trea&s;ures, he would a&s;k no more than li|berty to di&s;&s;olve &s;ome few unnece&s;&s;ary religious hou&s;es, and be&s;tow the revenues to this u&s;e. King Henry, it is &s;aid, very cordially acceded thereto, as he &s;hould be able to make &s;ome farther incroachments of that kind, to gratify his own lu&s;t of power and authority<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">An ab&s;tract from Lord Herbert, p. 146, 147, 148.</NOTE>. The King thus concurred with the Pope, who in favour of the Cardinal gave way to this &s;uppre&s;&s;ion, which was afterwards pur&s;ued by the King's &s;ole authority, and became the final ruin of the other mona&s;teries.</P>
<P>A.

But this at la&s;t be|came a public grievance; and his Maje&s;ty not approv|ing all the Cardinal's mea&s;ures, reproved him with &s;uch &s;everity, that he was obliged to appea&s;e the King's in|dignation with the mo&s;t abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Wol&s;ey, having &s;oon after furni&s;hed his fine palace at Hampton|court, pre&s;ented it to his Maje&s;ty, who gave him Richmond in exchange, together with the warme&s;t a&s;|&s;urances of uninterrupted affection.&mdash;This proud pre|late, in revenge of the Emperor Charles V. having twice fru&s;trated him of the triple crown, began to alienate his ma&s;ter from the intere&s;t of that Prince,

<P>A.

This Luther took ex|tremely ill, and was no &s;mall di&s;appointment to him, e&s;pecially as he had been encouraged, by Chri&s;tian II.

<P>A. D. 1527.] About this time commenced that &s;ingu|larly remarkable and intere&s;ting affair of the King's af|fection for Anne Boleyn, and his re&s;olution to &s;olicit a divorce from his pre&s;ent Queen. We &s;hall omit the hi&s;|tory of her birth, her education, and her being introduced at court.

It is &s;aid &s;he was contracted to Lord Piercy, which Cardinal Wol&s;ey hearing of, and probably &s;en&s;ible of the King's &s;ecret pa&s;&s;ion for her, &s;ought artfully and a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly to put a check to<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Cavendi&s;h's Life of Wol&s;ey.</NOTE>; in which he &s;ucceeded, upon a&s;&s;uring Piercy of the King's favour.</P>
<P>Some writers, in order to blacken the character of Henry, and tarni&s;h the merit of the reformation in England, have repre&s;ented the King's de&s;ire of &s;epa|rating from Queen Catherine as proceeding rather from his pa&s;&s;ion for Anne Boleyn, than from any real &s;cruples of con&s;cience. They have likewi&s;e, with great virulence, endeavoured to depreciate her per&s;on and morals; have fallen into divers incon&s;i&s;tencies, which have been detected and expo&s;ed by Lord Herbert, and other authors of credit, who have proved that Henry was
<PB N="389" REF="432">determined to &s;ue for a divorce, before Anne Boleyn returned to England from France, where &s;he had been educated. The King had an ingredient of &s;uper&s;tition in his character, and he imputed the death of his two &s;ons to the divine vengeance for marrying his brother's widow: and was extremely de&s;irous of male i&s;&s;ue, to prevent all di&s;putes about the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. He was &s;tartled at a doubt made by the Bi&s;hop of Tarbes, in France, about the legitimacy of his daughter Mary: and being a Prince of impetuous pa&s;&s;ions, longed to be united with a lady of more endearing qualifications, than his pre&s;ent Queen, who was not mi&s;tre&s;s of many per&s;onal attractions. His &s;cruples, which are a&s;cribed to the writings of Thomas Aquinas, were encouraged by Wol&s;ey, who hated Catherine, on account of her di&s;approving his licentious manner of life, and was equally incen&s;ed again&s;t her nephew, the Emperor, for having twice baffled him in his views upon the papacy. The Emperor's power was then formidable to all Europe; and Henry thought that he could not find a more favourable conjuncture to &s;ue for a di|vorce; for which, very probably, Anne Boleyn's charms made him the more impatient.</P>
<P>Be that as it may, the King got a declaration under the hands of all the Engli&s;h prelates, except John Fi&s;her Bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, declaring his marriage with Catherine unlawful: and having concerted the plea upon which his divorce was to be &s;olicited, &s;ent Dr. Knight, &s;ecretary of &s;tate, to negotiate it with Pope Clement VII. then pri&s;oner to the Emperor. Gregorio Ca&s;ali, the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary at Rome, had in&s;tructions from Wol&s;ey, dated De|cember 28, to &s;econd the endeavours of Dr. Knight<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an ab&s;tract of them in Bi&s;hop Burnet's Hi&s;tory, p. 45.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A. D. 1528.] The Cardinal al&s;o wrote to the Pope, urging that the affair might be di&s;patched, as it was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;afety and quiet of this nation, which was &s;o zealou&s;ly devoted to the apo&s;tolic &s;ee. Our

<P>The divorce of the King was now a political af|fair; and much anxiety attended the &s;ucce&s;s of it. The common people, in general, pitied Queen Ca|therine, and envied Anne Boleyn: the King, how|ever, to prevent any murmurings among the people, prote&s;ted in an a&s;&s;embly of Lords, "that nothing but the de&s;ire of giving &s;atisfaction to his con&s;cience, and care of e&s;tabli&s;hing the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown in a right line, had induced him to controvert his marriage."</P>
<P>However, about the middle of May this year, the King under&s;tanding a &s;trict league was pre&s;erved be|tween the Pope and the Emperor, determined, with|out relying any longer on either of their promi&s;es, to take the be&s;t cour&s;e he could for the conclu&s;ion of his own bu&s;ine&s;s, as he found that things grew rather more unpromi&s;ing from the eva&s;ions of the Pope and the Emperor. Henry al&s;o, being informed of it by &s;everal letters from Rome, gave orders to recall his envoys; though he &s;ent William Bennet, Doctor of Law, thither, to hinder the advocation of the cau&s;e; u&s;ing, at the &s;ame time, ways and means to intercept all di&s;patches from Campejus to Rome, and from Rome to him, or any other principal party. The King charged the two Cardinals to proceed; whereof public notice was given; the place appointed, viz. Black Friers, commonly called the parliament chamber, and May 31 fixed for hearing and determining the cau&s;e: when that day came, the Cardinals &s;ummoned the King and Queen to appear on the 18th of June; but at the meeting of the court then, the Queen's agents made exceptions to the authority of the le|gates, which however were over-ruled. On the 21&s;t the King and Queen appeared per&s;onally. Henry, when called upon, an&s;wered, Here: but the Queen, being cited, aro&s;e, and falling on her knees before the King, made a very pathetic &s;peech to him; after
<PB N="392" REF="435">which ri&s;ing up, &s;he made a low reverence, and retired from the court, although the crier required her to &s;tay. Her Maje&s;ty, being again &s;ummoned, appealed to the Pope, notwith&s;tanding &s;he had Archbi&s;hop Warham, Nicholas We&s;t Bi&s;hop of Ely, John Fi&s;her Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, and Henry Standi&s;h Bi&s;hop of St. A&s;aph, for her council. The Cardinals, with John Langland Bi&s;hop of Lincoln, John Clarke Bi|&s;hop of Bath, and John I&s;lip Abbot of We&s;tmin&s;ter, proceeded according to their commi&s;&s;ion; and, upon the Queen's refu&s;ing to appear, pronounced her con|tumacious. Then the legates drew up twelve articles, to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by the examination of evidence. The King's council in&s;i&s;ted chiefly on the con&s;ummation of Prince Arthur's marriage with Catherine; and in the cour&s;e of their pleadings &s;poke &s;o indecently, that the Bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter &s;ignified his di&s;approba|tion and di&s;gu&s;t; for which he was checked by Wol|&s;ey, as pre&s;uming to interpo&s;e; and &s;ome &s;evere alter|cation pa&s;&s;ed between the&s;e two prelates. The evidence, however, produced many &s;trong pre&s;umptions that Arthur had carnally known the Queen; though &s;he her&s;elf declared, and &s;wore, to the contrary. During this time, the Emperor's agents pre&s;&s;ed the Pope to evoke the cau&s;e to Rome: and Campejus, on pretence of certain holidays there, adjourned the court to the 21&s;t of October; from whence it is plain that this Cardinal improved all opportunities to do his ma&s;ter good &s;ervice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hall, Hollin&s;hed, Stow, Herbert, Smollet,</NOTE>. Wol&s;ey's conduct, on this occa&s;ion, &s;eems va&s;tly &s;trange, by yielding &s;o far to the artifices of his colleague, as to abu&s;e a ma&s;ter, who had heaped &s;o many favours on him.</P>
<P>While the Emperor's &s;uit for an evocation was in agitation, the Pope received the news that his treaty with that Prince had been concluded at Barcelona: and immediately, before the &s;ame was publi&s;hed, he
<PB N="393" REF="436">granted, on July 15, an evocation of the proce&s;s, and &s;ent away an expre&s;s, notwith&s;tanding of the Engli&s;h agents a&s;&s;uring him that &s;uch a &s;tep would certainly dive&s;t him of his &s;piritual dominion in England. In the bull of evocation Henry was cited to appear at Rome in forty days, with a denunciation of divers cen&s;ures in ca&s;e of refu&s;al: but afterwards the Pope di&s;owned tho&s;e cen&s;ures, and prolonged the citation till Chri&s;tmas. Thus was Henry amu&s;ed for two whole years; and, after having entertained hopes, which he thought well-grounded, of &s;ucceeding in his de&s;ign, &s;aw him&s;elf farther as it were from his journey's end than when he &s;et out<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acta Regia, p. 395.</NOTE>. As for the Pope, the main point of the divorce, I mean the right of the parties in religion and con&s;cience, that was not what troubled his head, becau&s;e he only had his own private intere&s;ts in view; &s;o that the rea&s;ons alledged on both &s;ides were all to no purpo&s;e, and only &s;erved to gain time, which it was his intere&s;t to protract.</P>
<P>Henry did not think proper to obey the &s;ummons: nor was the Pope in great ha&s;te to pu&s;h on the affair, being plea&s;ed to find that he had brought it to &s;uch a pa&s;s, that nothing could be done without him, e&s;pe|cially as the Emperor's &s;entiments coincided with his own.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="inter">Cranmer's expedient con|cerning the divorce.</NOTE> Sometime after, Henry, in his return from a tour he had made through &s;ome coun|tries to amu&s;e his impatience, and divert his chagrin, lay at Waltham-cro&s;s, in the hou&s;e of Mr. Cre&s;&s;y, who&s;e &s;ons were under the tuition of Thomas Cranmer, a Doctor in Divinity, who had been Profe&s;&s;or at Oxford, and lo&s;t his office on account of his being married. This clergyman, who favoured the doctrine of Luther, being urged, at &s;upper, by Edward Fox and Stephen Gardiner, to give his &s;entiments of the divorce, propo&s;ed an expedient, with which the King was &s;o plea&s;ed, when he was in|formed
<PB N="394" REF="437">of it, that he was re&s;olved to hear it From Cranmer's own mouth. The propo&s;al was, that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould con&s;ult all the univer&s;ities, theo|logi&s;ts, and civilians, in Chri&s;tendom, concerning the di&s;pen&s;ation of Julius II. for his marriage with Cathe|rine; which, he &s;aid, would be attended with great advantage: for if the learned and the univer&s;ities de|termined that the di&s;pen&s;ation was &s;ufficient, the King's con&s;cience would be thereby quieted; but if on the contrary the opinions of the univer&s;ities were again&s;t the di&s;pen&s;ation, the Pope would never ven|ture to give any deci&s;ion contrary to opinions &s;o ge|nerally received and approved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When Fox and Gardiner mentioned this expedient to the King, he approved of it, &s;aying, <HI>"Aye, now we have got the right &s;ow by the ear."</HI></NOTE>. Henry was &s;o well plea&s;ed with Cranmer's conver&s;ation, that he ordered him to follow the court, and made him his coun&s;ellor on all emergencies.</P>
<P>However well &s;atisfied the King might be with this expedient of Dr. Cranmer, both he and Anne Bo|leyn were no le&s;s offended at Cardinal Wol&s;ey, as they imputed the mi&s;carriage of the divorce to the back|wardne&s;s with which he had acted in that affair. Henry, upon his return from the afore&s;aid tour, in October, commanded the Cardinal to re&s;ign the great &s;eal, which was offered to Archbi&s;hop Warham; but he declining the offer, on account of his great age, it was given to Sir Thomas More, a gentleman of learning and integrity.</P>
<P>Campejus, dreading the con&s;equences of his col|league's di&s;grace, de&s;ired leave to return to Italy, which was readily granted: but before he embarked, the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers rummaged all his baggage, on pretence of &s;earching for contraband goods; though it is &s;uppo&s;ed that they acted by the expre&s;s directions of the King, who longed to have in his cu&s;tody the de|cretal bull, which Campejus had brought from Rome,
<PB N="395" REF="438">annulling Catherine's &s;econd marriage, but had been committed to the flames by order of the Pope, while he was negotiating with the Emperor. When Cam|pejus complained of the officers behaviour as an out|rage again&s;t a legate of the holy &s;ee, Henry told him, that the officers had done their duty; that he was &s;ur|pri&s;ed at his a&s;&s;uming the character of legate, after his power and commi&s;&s;ion had been revoked; and &s;till more &s;urpri&s;ed, that, being Bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury, he &s;hould be &s;o ignorant of the laws of England, as to a&s;&s;ume that quality without the King's permi&s;&s;ion. Campejus, intimidated by this an&s;wer, thought him|&s;elf extremely happy in being allowed to depart with|out further mole&s;tation<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 464.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame month, in which Cardinal Wol&s;ey was deprived of the office of Lord Chancellor, Hales, the attorney-general, exhibited an information again&s;t him in the court of King's-Bench, accu&s;ing him of having violated the &s;tatute of premunire. The Car|dinal confe&s;&s;ed the indictment, pleaded ignorance of the &s;tatute, and &s;ubmitted him&s;elf to his Maje&s;ty's clemency. He was declared out of the King's pro|tection; his goods and chattels were forfeited to the crown; and his palace of York-hou&s;e (afterwards known by the name of Whitehall) was &s;eized for the King's u&s;e, together with all his rich furniture and prodigious wealth. This rever&s;e of fortune humbled the imperious Cardinal, who had formerly dictated to his Sovereign: he petitioned the King for a pro|tection for his per&s;on; and that was immediately granted, as well as a free pardon. He was re&s;tored to the Archbi&s;hopric of York, and &s;ee of Winche&s;ter; he retrieved of his own effects to the amount of &s;ix thou&s;and pounds, in furniture, money, and plate; and received divers kind me&s;&s;ages from the King and Anne Boleyn: &s;o that Henry's aim at this juncture

<PB N="396" REF="441">was to humble the pride, but not to ruin the fortune, of his old favourite. The&s;e favourable &s;entiments, however, were not of long duration: his enemies now prevailed at court, and brought into the hou&s;e of Lords an impeachment of high trea&s;on, in four and forty articles; importing, that he had abu&s;ed his le|gatine power, acted tyrannically in the office of Chan|cellor, expedited divers orders of the utmo&s;t impor|tance, and executed treaties without the King's know|ledge and concurrence; that he had behaved de&s;poti|cally on many occa&s;ions, more like an ea&s;tern &s;overeign than an Engli&s;h mini&s;ter; that he had practi&s;ed ex|tortion, bribery, and all manner of corruption; &s;ought to equal, and even preferred, him&s;elf to his Maje&s;ty, by writing in orders and in&s;tructions, <HI>Ego &amp; Rex meus,</HI> I and my King; and that he had endangered his So|vereign's health by breathing upon him, and whi&s;pering in his ear, when he knew him&s;elf deeply infected with the veneral di&s;temper. The&s;e articles pa&s;&s;ed in the hou&s;e of Lords, which was filled with his enemies; but among the Commons, he was &s;o defended by Thomas Cromwell, one of the members, and formerly one of his dome&s;tics, with &s;uch &s;trength of argument, that no act of trea&s;on could be proved again&s;t him, and the pro&s;ecution dropped. Wol&s;ey manife&s;ted very little fortitude under his misfortune: he became ab|ject and di&s;con&s;olate, and at length &s;ickened. The King's tenderne&s;s &s;eemed to revive when he heard of the Cardinal's illne&s;s; he had formerly &s;ent him a torquoi&s;e ring, as a te&s;timony of his protection, which Wol&s;ey received on the road to Winche&s;ter; and was &s;o affected with that in&s;tance of royal goodne&s;s, that he alighted from his hor&s;e, and fell upon his knees in a tran&s;port of joy.

This kind me&s;&s;age contributed,
<PB N="397" REF="442">in a great mea&s;ure, to the recovery of the Cardinal, who obtained Henry's permi&s;&s;ion to re&s;ide, for the benefit of the air, at his former hou&s;e at Richmond in Surry<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. v. p. 465.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A. D. 1530.] During the&s;e tran&s;actions, the King of England was not unmindful of the divorce. The Queen had been for &s;ome time removed from court, where Anne Boleyn appeared in great &s;plendor, governing the King by a nod, and having great re|&s;pect paid her by the nobility. Cranmer wrote a book in favour of the &s;olicited divorce, and afterwards accom|panied two amba&s;&s;adors to Bologna, where they had audience of the Pope and the Emperor. Clement expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to give &s;atisfaction to the Engli&s;h Monarch; but he dur&s;t not act without the con&s;ent of Charles, who was inflexible in the cau&s;e of his aunt Queen Catherine. About the &s;ame time, Henry &s;ent learned men to con&s;ult the foreign univer&s;ities; and tho&s;e of Paris, Angers, Bourges, Orleans, Thoulou&s;e, Bologna, Ferrara, and Padua, unanimou&s;ly agreed, that the di&s;pen&s;ation granted by Pope Julius II. being contrary to the law of God, the marriage of Henry with Catherine could not be valid. The Engli&s;h uni|ver&s;ities &s;ub&s;cribed to the &s;ame opinion, though not without great oppo&s;ition from the ma&s;ters of arts, e&s;|pecially at Oxford, and a warm conte&s;t at Cambridge. This oppo&s;ition aro&s;e from tho&s;e who were aver&s;e to the Lutheran doctrine, which they apprehended would be countenanced by Anne Boleyn, in re&s;ent|ment to the Roman pontiff<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. v. p. 469.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Henry, finding his application to Pope Clement ineffectual, prevailed upon divers of his prelates and nobility to &s;end him a &s;harp remon&s;trance, by way of letter; in which, after having mentioned the obliga|tions he owed to the King, the deci&s;ion of &s;o many l$arned univer&s;ities, and the little regard that had been paid to them at the court of Rome, they gave
<PB N="398" REF="443">him notice, that, &s;hould he refu&s;e to do ju&s;tice in the affair of the divorce, they would conclude them&s;elves abandoned by the &s;ee of Rome, and &s;eek for other remedies. To this epi&s;tle, which was &s;igned by Car|dinal Wol&s;ey, the primate of Canterbury, four Bi&s;hops, two Dukes, two Marqui&s;es, thirteen Earls, two Vi&s;counts, three and twenty Barons, two and twenty Abbots, and eleven Commoners, Clement wrote an an&s;wer to ju&s;tify his conduct. His apology was far from being admitted; and, in order to anticipate any &s;tep that might be taken in favour of Catherine, by the court of Rome, or the Cardinal, Henry i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, forbidding all per&s;ons whatever to pur|cha&s;e any thing from Rome, or el&s;ewhere, that &s;hould be contrary to his royal prerogatives, or to divulge any thing of that nature, on pain of incurring his in|dignation, and the penalties &s;pecified in the &s;tatutes of provi&s;ors and premunire. Then he ordered &s;ome learned men in the kingdom to collect, compare, and publi&s;h, all that had been or could be alledged in favour of the divorce, including the opinions of the univer|&s;ities, and a particular an&s;wer to a book, which Fi&s;her<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When King Henry wrote again&s;t Luther, and called in all his books, he granted a privilege for printing a treati&s;e wrote by this prelate again&s;t the German reformers.</NOTE>, Bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, had written in defence of the marriage<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol, v. p. 470.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Cardinal Wol&s;ey &s;till continued fluctuating between hope and de&s;pair. He had, in the beginning of his di&s;grace, been reduced to great nece&s;&s;ity, from which he was relieved by John Kite Bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le; but afterwards his affairs &s;eemed to take a more favourable turn. He received a full pardon, con&s;iderable ap|pointments, and kind me&s;&s;ages from the King; and was permitted to &s;it in parliament among the Peers, though he had the mortification to &s;ee a bill pa&s;s con|firming his own forfeiture to the King; and, among
<PB N="399" REF="444">others, his college at Oxford; at the fate of which he was more afflicted than any other circum&s;tance of his misfortune. He wrote to his Maje&s;ty in the mo&s;t humble &s;train, begging the foundation might continue, and &s;ent a pathetic letter on the &s;ame &s;ubject to Crom|well, who, for his fidelity to his late ma&s;ter, was re|ceived into Henry's &s;pecial favour: but no regard was paid to the Cardinal's importunity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This noble &s;eminary was at fir&s;t called <HI>Cardinal's college,</HI> then <HI>King's college,</HI> and la&s;t of all got the name <HI>Chri&s;t-church college,</HI> which it &s;till retaineth. Wol&s;ey's placing his own, above the royal, arms, on the gate of this &s;tructure, gave great umbrage to the King. John Higdon, the fir&s;t Dean, was a great per&s;ecutor of the Wick|liffites, &s;everal of whom he confined in a dungeon, where the &s;alt fi&s;h of the college was u&s;ually kept. Church Hi&s;tory, p. 143.</NOTE>. At length Anne Boleyn, and the re&s;t of his enemies, thinking him too near the King, obtained an order for his removing from Richmond to his archbi&s;hopric of York. He obeyed this command, though not without great re|luctance; and proceeded by &s;low journeys to Cawood|ca&s;tle, attended by a retinue of one hundred and twenty hor&s;emen. Upon the road he di&s;tributed his alms and benediction with great liberality; and now for the fir&s;t time began to be popular, the people crouding to &s;ee him, and a&s;k his ble&s;&s;ing, as he pa&s;&s;ed through the country. Not that he had entirely laid a&s;ide the thoughts of wordly grandeur. He intended to be in&s;talled, according to the ancient cu&s;tom, with great &s;olemnity; and began to make great prepara|tions for that ceremony. Whil&s;t he was thus employed, for the gratification of idle vanity, his adver&s;aries exerted them&s;elves &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly, that, before the day appointed for the in&s;tallation, he was, together with one Augu&s;tine his phy&s;ician, arre&s;ted by the Earl of Northumberland, and Sir Walter Welch, for high trea&s;on. Wol&s;ey betrayed marks of fear and di&s;order, when the Earl &s;ignified his errand; but, recovering his &s;pirits a little, he prote&s;ted that he would not
<PB N="400" REF="445">yield until he &s;hould &s;ee his commi&s;&s;ion, which his Lord&s;hip refu&s;ed to produce; yet at the &s;ight of Welch, whom he knew to be a gentleman of the King's privy chamber, he &s;ubmitted. Augu&s;tine was im|mediately hurried off to London in the mo&s;t ignomi|nious manner: but the Cardinal was indulged with &s;ome time to prepare for his journey, which he then began with an heavy heart. By the way he was deli|vered by Northumberland to the care of the Earl of Shrew&s;bury, who told him that he was commanded to u&s;e him re&s;pectfully, as one whom the King highly favoured; and a&s;&s;ured him, that though Henry found him&s;elf obliged to bring him to trial for the &s;atisfac|tion of &s;ome particular per&s;ons, he did not harbour the lea&s;t doubt of his integrity. Such was his dejec|tion, that his &s;pirits and re&s;olution him even failed after the&s;e a&s;&s;urances. He moved very &s;lowly, and &s;taid a whole fortnight at Sheffield-ca&s;tle, where he was &s;eized with a dy&s;entery. There he was joined by Sir William King&s;ton, captain of the King's guard, and con&s;table of the Tower, who came attended with four and twenty yeomen of the guard, formerly the Cardinal's &s;ervants. Sir William &s;aluted Wol&s;ey on the knee with a very gracious me&s;&s;age from his Maje&s;ty, who de&s;ired he would make no more ha&s;te than &s;tood con|&s;i&s;tent with his convenience and health. But whether the Cardinal was con&s;cious of having been engaged in &s;ome clande&s;tine tran&s;actions with the Emperor and the Pope, or apprehended that his adver&s;aries were bent upon his de&s;truction, he remained di&s;con&s;olate, notwith&s;tanding all tho&s;e encouraging addre&s;&s;es; and his di&s;temper gained ground. Neverthele&s;s, he pro|ceeded on his journey, until he arrived at Leice&s;ter-abbey; where feeling his end approaching, he &s;ent for Sir William King&s;ton, and &s;poke to this effect, "Had I &s;erved God as diligently as I have done the King, he would not have abandoned my grey heirs; but this is my ju&s;t reward.

Cardinal Wol&s;ey had been con|victed of exerci&s;ing the legatine power in England without a &s;pecial licence from his Maje&s;ty, and in giv|ing away benefices in that capacity, contrary to the &s;tatutes of provi&s;ors and premunire: con&s;equently tho&s;e, who acknowledged his authority, were acce&s;|&s;ary to his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. This was the ca&s;e of the whole body of the clergy, who were accordingly ac|cu&s;ed of having violated the laws of the kingdom. Such a pro&s;ecution an&s;wered the King's purpo&s;e in two re&s;pects: it not only furni&s;hed him with a pretence for extorting a large &s;um of money, but al&s;o hum|bled the clergy in the eyes of the populace, and ren|dered them more dependant on his plea&s;ure. In vain they pleaded, that Henry him&s;elf had con&s;ented to the Cardinal's u&s;ing the legatine function: they were con|victed of the crime laid to their charge, and all their effects confi&s;cated, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction of the &s;ubjects in general, who had long groaned under eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyranny. The clergy, &s;eeing how low their credit was among the people, and the little re|gard which the nation paid to papal authority, re&s;ol|ved to &s;ubmit, and to implore the King's pardon, for which they agreed to pre&s;ent him with 100,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;ter|ling. A committee of the convocation of Canter|bury being appointed to draw up this act and petition, &s;ome individuals, in the intere&s;t of the court, propo&s;ed, that, in this public act, the clergy &s;hould own the King as protector and &s;upreme head of the Engli&s;h church. This propo&s;al at fir&s;t met with great oppo&s;ition; and the con&s;ideration of it was referred till the next meet|ing, when, by means of Archbi&s;hop Warham, Tho|mas Cromwell, and others of the council, it was agreed, that the King &s;hould be &s;tiled <HI>&s;upreme head of the church,</HI> as far as was agreeable to the law of Chri&s;t.

<P>This acqui&s;ition of power and wealth &s;atisfied Henry; and he indulged the delinquents with an ample pardon: but the Commons refu&s;ed to pa&s;s the bill, unle&s;s the laity, who might be liable to the &s;ame pro&s;ecution, &s;hould be comprehended. His Maje&s;ty, being informed of this ob&s;tacle, &s;ent a me&s;|&s;age to the Commons, importing, that he was re&s;ol|ved to be ma&s;ter of his own favours, which he would never grant upon compul&s;ion; and the hou&s;e, dread|ing his di&s;plea&s;ure, pa&s;&s;ed the bill without further op|po&s;ition. Then he favoured the laity with an act of amne&s;ty; which did not, however, include colleges and mona&s;teries; for the&s;e were afterwards obliged to pay for a compo&s;ition. Henry &s;oon after adjourned the parliament, and ordered the deci&s;ions and writings in favour of the divorce to be printed and publi&s;hed, that all his &s;ubjects might under&s;tand the ca&s;e before the next &s;e&s;&s;ion. As he pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired to obtain Catherine's con&s;ent to a &s;eparation, he &s;ent &s;everal Bi|&s;hops and lay noblemen to per&s;uade her to wave her appeal: and when they urged her to refer the cau&s;e to the deci&s;ion of four eccle&s;ia&s;tics, and as many &s;ecu|lars, &s;he &s;aid "&s;he would pray to God to &s;end the King a quiet con&s;cience, but &s;he was his lawful wife, and would abide by her right, until the court of Rome &s;hould declare the contrary."</P>
<P>The humiliation of the Bi&s;hops was extremely agree|able to the Engli&s;h, who then began openly to di&s;cu&s;s controverted points of religion, but were often, by
<PB N="405" REF="450">their indi&s;creet zeal, hurried into the dangerous extre|mities of libertini&s;m or fanatici&s;m. The prelates, in order to lighten the burden of the &s;um they had grant|ed to their &s;overeign, were de&s;irous that a part &s;hould be borne by the inferior clergy; and John Stoke&s;ley, Bi&s;hop of London, a&s;&s;embled &s;ome prie&s;ts of that me|tropolis in the chapter hou&s;e of St. Paul's, to propo&s;e an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment; hoping, that if he could obtain the con&s;$nt of a few at fir&s;t, the re&s;t would follow their example. But all the London prie&s;ts, being appri&s;ed of his intention, went thither in a tumultuous manner, accompanied by a great number of laymen: and when Stoke&s;ley made the propo&s;al, they an&s;wered, they had never meddled with any of Cardinal Wol&s;ey's faculties, and con&s;equently had not incurred the premunire; that their livings were already too &s;mall for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; that as the guilt lay entirely among the Bi&s;hops and Abbots, they only ought to bear the puni&s;hment; that as for them&s;elves, they had not tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed and there|fore would not pay for a pardon. They had already bur&s;t open the door, and committed divers irregula|rities; and when the Prelate's officers threatened them with condign puni&s;hment, a &s;harp conflict en&s;ued, in which Stoke&s;ley's &s;ervants having been very roughly handled, his Lord&s;hip di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the rioters with his ble&s;&s;ing, a&s;&s;uring them that they &s;hould not be called in que&s;tion for the di&s;turbance. Neverthele&s;s, he complained to the Chancellor, by who&s;e order fifteen prie&s;ts, and five laymen, were committed to pri&s;on: but whether the inferior clergy paid any part of the compo&s;ition, is not a&s;certained. King Henry, alarm|ed at this tumult, re&s;olved to convince his people, that, though he had &s;haken off the Papal yoke, his intention was not to violate the e&s;&s;entials of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church; and therefore ordered the laws again&s;t heretics to be rigorou&s;ly executed; an or|der which was attended with the death of two eccle|&s;ia&s;tics,
<PB N="406" REF="451">and a lawyer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was James Bainham, a gentleman of the Middle-Temple, who having on a former occa&s;ion been taken up, was put in a pri|&s;on in Sir Thomas More's hou&s;e, and whipped at a tree in his gar|den, called <HI>the tree of truth.</HI> Becau&s;e he would not accu&s;e his ac|quaintances of the Temple, nor di&s;cover where his books were con|cealed, he was &s;ent to the Tower, and there &s;o racked, that he be|came lame.

Francis concluded an agreement with the Lu|theran Princes, who formed the league of Smalcalde, and per&s;uaded the Engli&s;h Monarch to a&s;&s;i&s;t them with 50,000 crowns, which were remitted by the hands of the French amba&s;&s;ador, as a &s;um to be employed for the defence and con&s;ervation of the rights and privi|leges of the empire.</P>
<P>Mean time Henry was attentive to the internal &s;tate of his kingdom. He rea&s;&s;embled the parliament in January; when the Commons, having been previou&s;ly in&s;tructed by the court, pre&s;ented an addre&s;s, be&s;eech|ing him to con&s;ent to the reformation of &s;undry abu&s;es which had crept into the immunities enjoyed by the clergy. The King an&s;wered, that, before he could a|&s;&s;ent to a propo&s;al of &s;uch importance, he would hear what the eccle&s;ia&s;tics had to &s;ay in their own defence. This &s;tep was taken to &s;hew them, as they were odi|ous to the parliament, how much they needed his royal
<PB N="407" REF="452">protection. Several &s;tatutes were enacted, which &s;light|ly touched upon the privileges of the clergy; though they were abundantly con&s;oled for the&s;e mortifications, by an act relea&s;ing them from the payment of <HI>annates</HI> to the Pope, which had ever been a heavy burden<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This famous &s;tatute imported, that &s;ince the reign of the late King, above 160,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> had been &s;ent to Rome, on account of an|nates or fir&s;t-fruits, palls and bulls for bi&s;hoprics: that the annates had been originally intended as a contribution for a war again&s;t the infidels; but as they were not employed for that purpo&s;e, it was en|acted, that they &s;hould not be paid for the future: that not above five <HI>per cent.</HI> of the actual revenue &s;hould be paid for the bulls of bi&s;hoprics: that in ca&s;e of the Pope's refu&s;ing to grant them on the&s;e conditions, the Bi&s;hop elect &s;hould be pre&s;ented by the King to the metropolitan of the province, by whom he &s;hould be con&s;e|crated: but, &s;hould the Archbi&s;hop refu&s;e con&s;ecration, on pre|tence that he him&s;elf had not as yet received his bull or pall, two prelates nominated by the King &s;hould perform the ceremony; and then the elect &s;hould be deemed lawfully con&s;ecrated.</NOTE>. The parliament declared, that it &s;hould be in the King's power to annul or confirm this &s;tatute within a certain time. If, in that interval, he &s;hould make an ac|commodation with the court of Rome, it &s;hould be deemed inviolable: but, &s;hould the Pope, on account of &s;uch accommodation, pretend to harra&s;s the kingdom with &s;entences of excommunication and interdict, the&s;e cen&s;ures &s;hould be held as null and void; all eccle&s;i|a&s;tics were forbid to publi&s;h them, and ordered to ce|lebrate divine &s;ervice, as if they had never been i&s;&s;ued<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. vi. p. 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>About this period, the King received a letter from the Pope, intimating that he had heard of putting a|way his Queen, and keeping another per&s;on, called Anne, as his wife, to the great &s;candal of his charac|ter, and contempt of the holy apo&s;tolic &s;ee, before which the &s;uit of the divorce was &s;till depending: he therefore exhorted him to take back Queen Catherine, and di&s;mi&s;s the &s;aid Anne; and in &s;o doing, he would avoid a rupture with the Emperor, who would never otherwi&s;e dige&s;t &s;uch an indignity as he had put upon
<PB N="408" REF="453">his aunt, and prevent an interruption in the union of Chri&s;tendom. It does not appear that Henry &s;ent a particular an&s;wer to this epi&s;tle: but he di&s;patched Dr. Bennet to Rome in quality of amba&s;&s;ador, to lay be|fore Clement the deci&s;ions and opinions of univer&s;ities and learned men touching the divorce. Bennet was al&s;o charged with a letter, in which the King taxed the Pontiff with ignorance, partiality, and deceit; de|clared that he did not intend to impugn his authority further, unle&s;s compelled; and de&s;ired him to con|form to the opinion of &s;o many learned ca&s;ui&s;ts, and do his duty according to the dictates of his con&s;cience.</P>
<P>Clement, however, in&s;tead of gratifying the King's inclination, i&s;&s;ued a citation, requiring him to appear in per&s;on, or by proxy, at Rome, to an&s;wer to the Queen's appeal; and Sir Edward Karne was &s;ent thi|ther as Henry's excu&s;ator. Sir Edward found the con|&s;i&s;tory divided in their opinions; the Cardinals in the Emperor's intere&s;t urging the Pope to proceed in the cau&s;e, while the more moderate advi&s;ed him to act with caution, as, by adhering to Charles, he would pro|bably lo&s;e England. Clement being informed of the bill concerning the annates, expo&s;tulated on that &s;ub|ject with Karne, and his colleague Edmund Bonner, who an&s;wered, that as it was &s;till in the King's power to revoke the act, it would depend upon his Holine&s;s whether it &s;hould be annulled or confirmed. The ex|cu&s;atory plea was argued in the con&s;i&s;tory, and, after much debate, neither allowed nor rejected. The va|cation approaching, the Pope and college of Cardinals wrote a letter to the Engli&s;h Monarch, intreating him to &s;end a proxy in the winter: and Bonner, who was di&s;patched to England on this occa&s;ion, had in&s;truc|tions from three Cardinals, who were gained over to the King's intere&s;t, to a&s;&s;ure him that the affair could be judged in no other judicature but in the con&s;i&s;tory, and that he had nothing to fear from Clement, who now leaned to the French party.</P>
<PB N="409" REF="454">
<P>While the&s;e things were acting at Rome, the parlia|ment of England met again in April; and the mo&s;t remarkable tran&s;action, before its prorogation on ac|count of the plague breaking out at London, was a motion by one Temp&s;e, a member of the hou&s;e of Commons, that an addre&s;s might be pre&s;ented to the King, praying him to take back Queen Catherine. Henry was highly incen&s;ed at this freedom, for which he chid the Speaker, and appealed to his own con&s;ci|ence for the ju&s;tification of his conduct.</P>
<P>Immediately after this prorogation, Sir Thomas More, dreading the con&s;equences of a total rupture with the court of Rome, and di&s;liking the per&s;on and proceedings of Anne Boleyn, re&s;igned the great &s;eal, which was given to Sir Thomas Audley.</P>
<P>The Pope &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the King, propo&s;ing to &s;end a legate, with two auditors of the Rota, to try the cau&s;e in &s;ome indifferent place, re&s;erving the &s;entence to him&s;elf; and that a truce &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed for four years, before the expiration of which he would call a general council; though he had no de&s;ign to &s;ummon &s;uch an a&s;&s;embly, as the la&s;t had curtailed the Papal encroachments. Henry di&s;patched Sir Tho|mas Elliot with an an&s;wer to the&s;e propo&s;als, import|ing, that he could take no re&s;olution concerning a peace, without the concurrence of the French Mo|narch; that, con&s;idering the pre&s;ent &s;tate of religion in Germany, he apprehended a general council would be altogether un&s;ea&s;onable; that he could not &s;end a proxy to Rome, or any other place out of his own do|minions, without giving up the prerogative of his crown, and acting contrary to the laws of his king|dom; but that his Holine&s;s might remit the di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion of the affair to the clergy of England, and con|firm the &s;entence they might pronounce. Dr. Bennet made fre&s;h overtures touching the divorce; but they were rejected as expedients that would retrench the power of the Pope, who ordered the dean of the Rota
<PB N="410" REF="455">to &s;ummon the King of England to an&s;wer to the Queen's appeal. Sir Edward Karne prote&s;ted again&s;t the citation, as his ma&s;ter could not expect ju&s;tice at Rome, where the Emperor's intere&s;t predominated. He demanded that the Pontiff would de&s;i&s;t, otherwi&s;e Henry would appeal to the deci&s;ion of learned ca&s;ui&s;ts and univer&s;ities: he affirmed, that there was a nullity in all their proceedings; that the King his ma&s;ter was a &s;overeign prince, and the church of England a free church, over which the Pope had no legal authority.</P>
<P>Henry having agreed to an interview with the King of France, embarked for Calais on October 11, at|tended by Anne Boleyn, lately created Marchione&s;s of Pembroke, and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, and vi&s;ited Francis at Boulogne, where he was entertained, with equal magnificence and ho&s;pitality, for the &s;pace of four days; at the expiration of which, the French King ac|companied him to Calais, and was there &s;plendidly re|galed with entertainments of various &s;orts. In the conferences between the&s;e two Monarchs, Henry com|plained loudly of Clement's partiality; and Francis fo|mented his animo&s;ity again&s;t that Pontiff, although he was then negotiating a match between his &s;econd &s;on the Duke of Orleans, and the Pope's kin&s;woman, Ma|ry de Medicis.<NOTE PLACE="inter">Henry's marriage with Anne Boleyn.</NOTE> When the two Kings parted, Henry returned to England, and &s;oon after was privately married to Anne Boleyn.</P>
<P>A. D. 1533.] The Engli&s;h nation re&s;olved to con|cur heartily with the King in all his mea&s;ures for abo|li&s;hing the Papal authority. The parliament a&s;&s;em|bling in February, enacted a &s;tatute, prohibiting all appeals to Rome, under the penalty &s;pecified in the &s;tatute of premunire.<NOTE PLACE="inter">Henry's marriage with Catherine annulled, and that with Anne Boleyn confirmed.</NOTE> &mdash; But the chief thing that engro&s;&s;ed his Maje&s;ty's atten|tion, was the getting his marriage with Catherine formally annulled. Dr. Cran|mer was a per&s;on in whom the King had great confidence; and being in Germany when
<PB N="411" REF="456">the archiepi&s;copal chair of Canterbury became vacant, by the death of Archbi&s;hop Warham, was obliged to return, though with reluctance, to &s;upply his place, &s;ince Henry looked upon him as the fitte&s;t per&s;on, on account of his courage and learning, to put the fini&s;h|ing &s;troke to the divorce. When he had &s;ubmitted to the will of his Sovereign, he &s;crupled taking the u&s;ual oath to the Pope; until Henry, by way of &s;al|vo, propo&s;ed a previous prote&s;tation again&s;t it. Cran|mer having thus got over his objection, was put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the temporalities of his &s;ee. Then the convocation of Canterbury was a&s;&s;embled, and re|quired to give their opinion on the following que|&s;tions: Whether or not the di&s;pen&s;ation of Pope Ju|lius II. for the marriage of Catherine and Henry, was &s;ufficient to render the &s;aid marriage binding and va|lid? and whether or not the con&s;ummation of Ar|thur's nuptials with that Prince&s;s had been fully pro|ved? On April 5, the convocation declared, that the Pope had no power to grant di&s;pen&s;ations again&s;t the law; and that the con&s;ummation of the fir&s;t mar|riage had been as fully proved as the nature of the ca&s;e would permit. The &s;ame an&s;wers were made to tho&s;e que&s;tions by the convocation of York. The Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury then demanded his Maje|&s;ty's permi&s;&s;ion to proceed again&s;t his former marriage with Catherine, who&s;e con&s;ent to the divorce the King had attempted by fair means: but Henry's endeavours proving ineffectual, Catherine was &s;ummoned to ap|pear at Dun&s;table, near the place of her re&s;idence. She rejecting the citation, Cranmer pronounced &s;en|tence, declaring her marriage null, as being contrary to the law of God; and, by another, confirmed the King's marriage with Anne Boleyn, who was crowned on the 1&s;t of June.</P>
<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, the King of England had de&s;ired his ally of France to &s;end over &s;ome per&s;on of confidence, to whom he might impart &s;ome matters
<PB N="412" REF="457">of con&s;equence: and Francis pitched upon William du Bellay, Lord of Langeais, who was ordered to tell Henry, that the marriage between the Duke of Orleans and Mary de Medicis was agreed on, and would be celebrated at Mar&s;eilles, in the pre&s;ence of the Pope and King of France; that the pre&s;ence of Henry, at &s;uch a juncture, would probably induce his Holine&s;s to comply with his de&s;ires; or that, &s;hould he decline coming in per&s;on, he might &s;end thither an envoy to &s;olicit his bu&s;ine&s;s. When Du Bellay arrived in England, the King acquainted him, that as Cle|ment had ob&s;tinately rejected all his propo&s;als, he was re&s;olved to renounce Clement in his turn; that he had married Anne Boleyn, but that he would keep his marriage &s;ecret until the month of May, to &s;ee if the King of France could prevail upon the Bi&s;hop of Rome to do him ju&s;tice; but &s;hould that Pontiff &s;till con|tinue ob&s;tinate, he would entirely withdraw him&s;elf from the Papal power. He likewi&s;e told Du Bellay, that he had written a book upon the u&s;urpation of the Roman &s;ee, and upon the prerogatives of crowned heads; but would not publi&s;h it, until all hopes of accommodation &s;hould vani&s;h. It was not in his power, however, to conceal his marriage much longer, for his new wife became pregnant; and, in order to pre&s;erve her reputation, it was judged nece&s;&s;ary, that her marriage &s;hould come under the cognizance of the convocation.</P>
<P>The Pope was &s;o incen&s;ed at the proceedings of that a&s;&s;embly, and Cranmer's &s;entence, together with what had been written again&s;t the power of the pontificate in Henry's book (a copy of which had, by that time, been peru&s;ed at Rome) that he declared the King de&s;erved excommunication, unle&s;s he &s;hould, before the end of September, renounce all that had been done contrary to the authority of the Holy &s;ee; and forth with rever&s;ed the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury's decree. Clement &s;till hoped that &s;ome expedient might

That nobleman, while he re&s;ided in France, being informed of the mea&s;ures taken at Rome again&s;t his ma&s;ter, and acquainting him therewith, was recalled. Neverthele&s;s, Henry, at the de&s;ire of the French Monarch, &s;ent Stephen Gardiner, lately created Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, with Sir Francis Bryan, and Sir John Wallop, to attend him at the interview: and the&s;e were accompanied by Edmund Bonner, before-mentioned, who was an ec|cle&s;ia&s;tic of great impudence and re&s;olution. After the celebration of the nuptials at Mar&s;eilles, Francis prevailed upon the Pope to &s;atisfy the King of Eng|land: but Clement, in order to &s;ave the honour of the Holy &s;ee, in&s;i&s;ted upon judging the cau&s;e in a con&s;i&s;to|ry, from which the Cardinals of the Emperor's factions were to be excluded. Bonner, who was ignorant of this re&s;olution, demanded an audience of the Pontiff, and told him, that Henry had appealed to a future council from any Papal &s;entence, that either was, or might be, given again&s;t him. The Pope &s;aid, he would take the advice of the Cardinals; and, in a few days, informed him, that the appeal was not receiva|ble: but Bonner, without being intimidated by this an&s;wer, proceeded to notify Archbi&s;hop Cranmer's appeal from the rever&s;ion of the &s;entence he had pro|nounced; and Clement was &s;o exa&s;perated at Bonner's pre&s;umption, that he threatened to cau&s;e him to be thrown into a cauldron of molten lead. Francis was equally offended at the Engli&s;hman's in&s;olence and indi&s;cretion, and promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Pope in taking vengeance on him for &s;uch an outrage: neverthele&s;s, he allowed the delinquent to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>That Monarch, notwith&s;tanding Bonner's un&s;ea&s;on|able intervention, did not de&s;pair of &s;eeing the di&s;pute terminated in an amicable manner; and, for that end,

The Prelate, having gained this point, &s;et out for Rome in the middle of winter, and found Clement very well di&s;po&s;ed to agree to this expedient, provided the King of England would bind him&s;elf by a writing, under his hand, to abide by this determi|nation; and, in order to avoid delays, a certain day was fixed for the return of the courier, who was di&s;|patched to England for the in&s;trument. The Empe|ror's mini&s;ters were no &s;ooner informed of this nego|tiation, than they pre&s;&s;ed the Pope to revoke his en|gagement; and, by dint of importunity, obtained his promi&s;e, that if the me&s;&s;enger &s;hould not arrive within the limited time, he would hold him&s;elf di&s;engaged, and give &s;entence again&s;t Henry. The courier not arriving within the preci&s;e time, the Archbi&s;hop of Paris &s;olicited a delay of &s;ix days only: but Clement was &s;o much affected by the menaces of the Imperiali&s;ts, that, in&s;tead of complying with this reque&s;t, he preci|pitated matters &s;o much, that he fini&s;hed, in one con|&s;i&s;tory, what, according to the u&s;ual forms, ought to have been canva&s;&s;ed in three.

By another act it was decreed, that no &s;ynod, or convocation of the clergy, &s;hould be held without the royal licence: that the Sovereign &s;hould appoint two and thirty per&s;ons, from the parliament and clergy, to examine the canons and con&s;titutions of the church: that tho&s;e, which were nece&s;&s;ary, &s;hould be retained; and all the re&s;t abo|li&s;hed.</P>

<P>It was during this &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, that an act of attainder, or conviction, pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t Eli|zabeth Barton,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Account of the Maid of Kent.</NOTE> known by the appellation of <HI>The Maid of Kent,</HI> a native of the pari&s;h of Aldington, who had been tutored-by certain clergymen to excite di&s;turbances all over the kingdom. She had been troubled with hy&s;teric fits, during which &s;he uttered many incoherent and delirious expre&s;&s;ions, which induced the ignorant by-&s;tanders to believe &s;he was divinely in&s;pired. Richard Ma&s;ter, the pari&s;h prie&s;t, fore&s;eeing advantages to him&s;elf in trumping up an impo&s;ture, per&s;uaded this weak fanatic, that &s;he actually &s;poke from the influence of the Holy Gho&s;t, taught her to counterfeit trances, and utter &s;peeches, which were deemed the oracles of heaven. He was a&s;&s;i&s;ted in his knavi&s;h de&s;ign by one Doctor Bocking, a canon of Chri&s;t-church, in Canterbury. Elizabeth, thus in&s;tructed, became an apt pupil; pro|phe&s;ied with all the marks of holy emotion; writhed her body into &s;trange contortions; inveighed again&s;t the favourers of Prote&s;tanti&s;m as abominable heretics; exclaimed again&s;t the King's divorce, and, in order to rai&s;e the reputation of a chapel within the pari&s;h, declared, that the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin had appeared to her, and a&s;&s;ured that &s;he would never recover until &s;he &s;hould vi&s;it her image in that place of wor&s;hip. She ac|cordingly went in pilgrimage to the chapel; where, in the mid&s;t of a great concour&s;e of people, &s;he pretend|ed
<PB N="417" REF="462">to fall into a trance, poured forth pious ejaculations, declared that God had called her to a religious life, and appointed Bocking to be her gho&s;tly father. She pre|tended to be recovered of all her di&s;tempers by the inter|ce&s;&s;ion of the Virgin; took the veil; &s;aw vi&s;ions; heard melodious &s;ounds; received from Mary Mag|dalen a letter from heaven; was conveyed by an an|gel to Calais, while the King re&s;ided in that city; received the &s;acrament in his pre&s;ence, though invi&s;i|ble; and was brought back again, in the &s;ame man|ner, to her own mona&s;tery. She prophe&s;ied, that if Henry &s;hould proceed in the divorce, and mar$y another wife, his royalty would not be of a month's duration, but that he &s;hould die the death of a villain.</P>
<P>Her pretended revelations were collected, and in|&s;erted in a book, by a monk called Deering. War|ham Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, a credulous though pious Prelate, was impo&s;ed upon by her delu&s;ions. She was countenanced by Fi&s;her Bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter&punc; and others, who adhered to the intere&s;t of Queen Catherine. They held private meetings with this di|viner; and debauched many per&s;ons from their alle|giance, particularly the religious of Shene, Sion, and the Charter hou&s;e, and &s;ome of the Ob&s;ervants of Richmond, Greenwich, and Canterbury. One Peto; preaching before the King at Greenwich, told him he had been deceived by many lying prophets; but he, as a true Micajah, warned him that the dogs &s;hould lick his blood, as they had licked the blood of Ahab. Henry bore this in&s;ult with great temper; but, to undeceive the people, appointed Doctor Corren to preach before him, on the en&s;uing Sunday; when that eccle&s;ia&s;tic ju&s;tified the King's proceedings, and bran|ded Peto with the epithets of rebel, &s;landerer, dog, and traitor. He was interrupted by an Ob&s;ervant friar of the name of El&s;ton; who calling him a lying prophet, that &s;ought to e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown upon adultery, &s;poke with &s;uch virulence, that the King
<PB N="418" REF="463">was obliged to interpo&s;e, and command him to be &s;ilent; and he and Peto were afterwards &s;ummoned before the council, and rebuked for their intemperance. The churchmen, engaged in this con&s;piracy, encou|raged by the unu&s;ual lenity of the government, had re&s;olved to publi&s;h the <HI>maid</HI>'s revelations, in their &s;ermons, throughout the kingdom. They had com|municated them to the Pope's nuncio, to whom they al&s;o introduced their prophete&s;s; and exhorted Queen Catherine to per&s;i&s;t in her re&s;olution. At length the confederacy began to be con&s;idered as a very &s;erious affair; and Henry ordered Elizabeth Barton and her accomplices to be examined in the Star-chamber, where they confe&s;&s;ed all the particulars of the impo&s;ture, and appeared &s;oon after upon a &s;caffold in St. Paul's church|yard, at which place the articles of their confe&s;&s;ion were publickly read in their hearing. From thence they were conveyed to the Tower, where they remain|ed till the meeting of the parliament; which, having con&s;idered the ca&s;e, pronounced it a con&s;piracy again&s;t the King's life and crown, and attainted the <HI>maid,</HI> or <HI>nun,</HI> with her accomplices, as guilty of high trea&s;on. In the cour&s;e of the inquiry it was di&s;covered that the letter, &s;aid to have come from Mary Magdalen, was written by one Hankher&s;t of Canterbury; and that the door of a dormitory, alledged to have been opened by a miracle, that the <HI>nun</HI> might go into the chapel, and conver&s;e with God, was really opened for carnal com|merce between her and her a&s;&s;ociates. On April 20, &s;he was, with Bocking, Ma&s;ter, Deering, and two other accomplices called Gold and Ri&s;by, executed at Tyburn, when &s;he confe&s;&s;ed her impo&s;ture, laying the blame upon the confederates, who had impo&s;ed upon her ignorance; and craving pardon of God and the King, be&s;ought the people to pray for her and her fel|low &s;ufferers. All per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the books of her revelations were ordered to &s;end them to the &s;ecre|tary of &s;tate, on pain of fine and impri&s;onment.</P>
<PB N="419" REF="464">
<P>When the cheat was at fir&s;t di&s;covered, Cromwell, then &s;ecretary of &s;tate, exhorted Fi&s;her Bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter to acknowledge his offence, and a&s;k forgive|ne&s;s of the King, who, he knew, would grant it in con&s;ideration of his age and infirmities. The prelate rejected this advice with di&s;dain, and threatened to &s;peak his con&s;cience freely, &s;hould he be further trou|bled on that account. The &s;ecretary &s;ent him another letter, expo&s;tulating with him upon his mi&s;conduct, reminding him of having concealed matters that con|cerned his Maje&s;ty's life and dignity; a&s;&s;uring him, that, &s;hould he be brought to trial, he would certainly be found guilty; and urging him again to have recour&s;e to the clemency of the King, who would pardon what was pa&s;t, and take him into favour. Fi&s;her continued &s;till ob&s;tinate, refu&s;ing to make the lea&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and was, with Thomas Gold, Thomas Laurence, Edward Twaits, John Addi&s;on, and Thomas Abell, judged guilty of mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on, to forfeit their goods and chattels to the King, and to be impri&s;oned during his Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>After the prorogation of the parliament, the King &s;ent commi&s;&s;ioners through the whole kingdom, to ad|mini&s;ter the new oath to all his eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;ubjects, im|porting, that they would be faithful to the King, Queen, their heirs, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; that they held the King to be the &s;upreme head of the Engli&s;h church, and the Pope to be no more than any other Bi&s;hop; that they renounced all obedience to that Prelate; that they would preach the pure doctrines of the holy &s;crip|tures; and that they would publickly pray for the King, as the head of the Engli&s;h church, for the Queen, and the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. This oath was voluntarily taken by the majority of all the Abbots, Priors, Monks, and all the Bi&s;hops, except Fi&s;her; who, with Sir Thomas More, refu&s;ed to take it as it was then conceived. Sir Thomas declared him|&s;elf willing to &s;wear to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, provided he
<PB N="420" REF="465">might be allowed to draw up the oath. Cranmer and Cromwell expre&s;&s;ed great tenderne&s;s for him. They endeavoured to convince him by argument; and Cran|mer propo&s;ed that his expedient &s;hould be accepted: but the King being incen&s;ed again&s;t him and Fi&s;her, they were both committed to the Tower, debarred the u&s;e of pen, ink, and paper, and the Bi&s;hop was &s;tripped of every thing in his old age, except a few rags, which could hardly cover his nakedne&s;s.</P>

<PB N="427" REF="472">this attack, than, in conjunction with his friend Fran|cis King of France, he &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to the Princes of the league of Smalcade in Germany, to propo&s;e an union of intere&s;ts: but tho&s;e Prote&s;tants, who&s;e only aim was to enjoy liberty of con&s;cience, &s;aw no proba|bility of being able to maintain a &s;incere union with two Princes, who condemned their doctrine, and even per&s;ecuted &s;uch of their &s;ubjects as profe&s;&s;ed the&s;e doc|trines. They propo&s;ed, in their turn, that Henry &s;hould &s;ub&s;cribe <HI>the confe&s;&s;ion of Aug&s;burg</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 128 of this volume.</NOTE>; and he de&s;ired them to &s;end &s;ome able divines to confer with tho&s;e of England on that &s;ubject: he had no intention to conform to their tenets; for, on the contrary, he pretended to dictate to all the world.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this year, Cardinal Campejus, and another Italian, Hieronymus de Negutius (otherwi&s;e Ghinacer) were deprived of their bi&s;hoprics of Sali&s;|bury and Worce&s;ter<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See page 351 of ditto.</NOTE>, which were be&s;towed upon Nicholas Shaxton, and Hugh Latimer, who favoured
<PB N="428" REF="473">the reformation. John Hel&s;ey obtained the &s;ee of Roche&s;ter upon the death of Cardinal Fi&s;her, and Ed|ward Fox was promoted to that of Hereford.</P>
<P>Henry, apprehen&s;ive that James V. King of Scot|land, whom he conceived to be di&s;affected to his mea&s;ures, would take the fir&s;t opportunity of invading England, in ca&s;e of any civil commotion, thought he could not u&s;e a more effectual method to &s;ecure him|&s;elf from that quarter, than by per&s;uading his nephew to follow his example, in renouncing the Papal autho|rity. For this purpo&s;e he wrote a long letter to that Prince, explaining the motives of his &s;eparation from the &s;ee of Rome; and then propo&s;ed an interview. Although the reformation had gained footing in Scot|land, James him&s;elf had no intention to for&s;ake the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion; neverthele&s;s, he would not blunt|ly decline the meeting propo&s;ed by his uncle: but having received a brief from the Pope, forbidding him to hold an interview with Henry, he intimated that prohibition to his uncle; who having made prepara|tions for his journey, was extremely exa&s;perated at the repul&s;e.</P>
<P>A. D. 1536.] This year was u&s;hered in with the death of the unfortunate Queen Catherine, who departed this life at Kimbolton,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Death of Queen Cathe|rine.</NOTE>, in Huntingdon&s;hire, on January 8, after having &s;u&s;tained a long &s;eries of afflic|tions. She had been harra&s;&s;ed by repeated me&s;&s;ages from Henry, importuning her to re&s;ign the title of Queen, which &s;he never would lay down, prote&s;ting, that as the Pope had declared her marriage valid, &s;he would &s;ooner lo&s;e her life than her title; which &s;he continued to exact from all her &s;ervants. She became, however, very affable, and acquired great popularity among the country people. When the King propo&s;ed that &s;he &s;hould re&s;ide at Fotheringhay-ca&s;tle, &s;he de|clared, that &s;he would never go thither unle&s;s as a
<PB N="429" REF="474">pri&s;oner. She lived on the pen&s;ion a&s;&s;igned her as Prince&s;s Dowager of Wales; and though &s;he could have no great comfort in England, &s;he never expre&s;&s;ed the lea&s;t inclination to quit the kingdom, when no other motive, than her motherly care of the Prince&s;s Mary, could be &s;uppo&s;ed to make her re&s;idence agree|ble. In her will, &s;he de&s;ired her body might be bu|ried in a convent of <HI>Ob&s;ervant-friars;</HI> that five hundred ma&s;&s;es &s;hould be &s;aid for her &s;oul; and that a per&s;on &s;hould make a pilgrimage to <HI>Our Lady of Wal&s;ingham</HI>'s &s;hrine in Norfolk, and di&s;tribute 200 nobles in charity upon the road. She likewi&s;e bequeathed &s;ome legacies to her &s;ervants. Henry had declared, before the Car|dinal legates at the Black-friars, in 1529, that &s;he had been always a true and obedient wife, and was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of many excellent qualities; and when he heard of her la&s;t illne&s;s, &s;ent her a kind me&s;&s;age. She dictated a very tender letter to him; in which &s;he called him her dear lord and hu&s;band; forgave him all the trouble in which he had involved her; recommended her daughter Mary to his care and affection; de&s;ired he would provide for her three maids, and indulge her &s;ervants with a &s;mall gratuity; and concluded with the&s;e words, "I make this vow, that mine eyes de|&s;ire you above all things." She was undoubtedly a devout and virtuous Prince&s;s, who led a very &s;evere and mortified life; but &s;he was a bigot in religion, and of a fretful temper, which, perhaps, at fir&s;t ali|enated the King's affection, as &s;he had no per&s;onal charms to fix his wavering di&s;po&s;ition. Henry ex|pre&s;&s;ed &s;ome regret at her death: whil&s;t Queen Anne rejoiced openly at that event, and &s;eemed to take plea|&s;ure in communicating her &s;atisfaction to the public. The King would not allow Catherine to be buried ac|cording to her own directions: and her corp&s;e was in|terred in the abbey (now cathedral) church of Peter-borough.</P>

<P>The parliament rea&s;&s;embling, his Maje&s;ty repre|&s;ented to them, that the great number of mona&s;teries was an expence to the king|dom,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Act for &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing the le&s;&s;er mona|&s;teries.</NOTE> and de&s;ired them to apply &s;ome re|medy to the evil: in con&s;equence of which remon&s;trance, they pa&s;&s;ed an act, &s;uppre&s;&s;ing all mo|na&s;teries who&s;e revenues did not exceed 200 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and appro|priated their income to the King's u&s;e.

Then Henry erect|ed a new court of ju&s;tice, called <HI>the court of the augmen|tation of the King's revenue for taking cognizance of all &s;uch &s;eque&s;trations.</HI> The King having, as u&s;ual, obtained all he wi&s;hed from the parliament, di&s;&s;olved that a&s;&s;em|bly, after it had continued &s;itting &s;ix years, a longer term than any parliament had ever &s;ub&s;i&s;ted &s;ince the beginning of the Engli&s;h monarchy.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time that the parliament met, the clergy a&s;&s;embled in convocation, when a motion was made for a new tran&s;lation of the Bible into Engli&s;h, more correct than that of Tindal, which the Roman|i&s;ts taxed with being erroneous, and in many places &s;tuffed with mi&s;repre&s;entations. Gardiner, and the violent Papi&s;ts, oppo&s;ed the propo&s;al; but Cranmer, and his party, &s;upported and carried the motion. The King was petitioned to employ &s;ome able per&s;ons to execute this ta&s;k; the Queen &s;econded the peti|tion, with which Henry complied; and the perfor|mance was completed, and printed about three years afterwards at Paris; tho' the names of the tran&s;lators are not handed down to po&s;terity.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty began by this time to be cloyed with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Anne Boleyn, who had been lately delivered of a dead male child,<NOTE PLACE="inter">The trial and death of Anne Boleyn.</NOTE> to the un&s;peakable di&s;appointment of her hu&s;band, who was &s;uper&s;titious
<PB N="431" REF="478">enough to believe, that this accident was a judgment from heaven: but Henry was then captivated with the beauty of Jane Seymour, one of the Queen's ladies; and his pa&s;&s;ions were &s;o &s;trong and impetuous, that he &s;acrificed every thing to their gratification. The&s;e concurring motives, for his alienation from the Queen, were &s;trengthened by her rather too frank and free de|portment, which could not well &s;creen her from the imputation of levity and indi&s;cretion. The Duke of Norfolk, and all the friends of the Romi&s;h religion, were her enemies from the &s;ame motives, that &s;he pro|fe&s;&s;ed her&s;elf an advocate for the reformation, viz. &s;elf|intere&s;t. Her adver&s;aries took every advantage to in|flame Henry's jealous di&s;po&s;ition; the principal fo|menter of which was the Lady Rochford, Queen Anne's &s;i&s;ter-in-law, a woman of infamous character, who&s;e rancour to her mi&s;tre&s;s was unbounded. The &s;ame inveterate Lady Rochford hinted to the caprici|ous Henry, that his con&s;ort carried on a criminal cor|re&s;pondence with her own brother, the Lord Rochford: and the King's mind, already di&s;gu&s;ted with Anne, and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the charms of Jane Seymour, ea&s;ily imbibed what was alledged again&s;t the virtue of his connubial con&s;ort. Queen Anne was not only ac|cu&s;ed of ince&s;t with her brother, but likewi&s;e of living in carnal commerce with Henry Norris, groom of the &s;tole, We&s;ton and Brereton of the King's privy-cham|ber, and Mark Smeton, a mu&s;ician. The evidence at fir&s;t was only pre&s;umptive, being no other than an hear&s;ay declaration of Lady Wingfield, who confe&s;&s;ed &s;ome particulars on her death-bed: but that was &s;uffi|cient to ruffle &s;uch a mind as that of Anne's hu&s;band, who is &s;aid to have ob&s;erved her, at a tournament at Greenwich, to drop her handkerchief to one of her minions, that he might wipe his face, after having overheated him&s;elf in the exerci&s;e. But be that as it may, the King returned abruptly to Whitehall; the Queen was confined to her chamber; and her &s;uppo&s;ed
<PB N="432" REF="479">criminal a&s;&s;ociates, being apprehended at the &s;ame time, were committed to the Tower. Queen Anne &s;miled at fir&s;t, thinking the King was in je&s;t: but, when &s;he found it was a &s;erious affair, &s;he received the &s;acra|ment in her clo&s;et, and prepared for death. This re|ver&s;e of fortune affected her in &s;uch a manner, that &s;he was &s;eized with hy&s;teric fits, during which &s;he laughed and wept by turns; and uttered many incon&s;i&s;tencies, according to the nature of that di&s;ea&s;e. Next day &s;he was conveyed to the Tower, where &s;he fell upon her knees, and appealed to God for the knowledge of her innocence. She begged in vain to be admitted to the pre&s;ence of her hu&s;band. The Lady Boleyn, her uncle's wife, who always hated her, was ordered to be in the &s;ame chamber with her; and the &s;ame Lady Boleyn made a report of all the incoherent ravings of the afflicted pri&s;oner. Anne was vi&s;ited by the Duke of Norfolk, and others of the King's council, who endeavoured to draw her into a confe&s;&s;ion, by &s;aying &s;he was accu&s;ed by Norris and Smeton: but &s;he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in denying the charge, and told the Lieutenant of the Tower, "She was not more guilty with any man upon earth than him&s;elf." She confe&s;&s;ed, indeed, that &s;he had, in the gaiety of heart, made u&s;e of &s;ome indi&s;creet expre&s;&s;ions to Smeton and We&s;ton; and that the familiarity of her behaviour had encouraged them to hint a pa&s;&s;ion for her. Every per&s;on at court abandoned the unhappy Queen in her di&s;tre&s;s, except Archbi&s;hop Cranmer, who, though forbid to come into the King's pre&s;ence, wrote a letter to him in her behalf; but his interce&s;&s;ion had no effect. On May 12, Norris, We&s;ton, Brereton, and Smeton, were tried in We&s;tmin&s;ter hall; when Smeton confe&s;&s;ed he had known the Queen carnally three times. The other three pleaded not guilty; but all four were condemned to die the death of traitors. On the 15th day of the month, the Queen and her brother Lord Rochford, were brought to their trial, before the Duke
<PB N="433" REF="480">of Norfolk, as Lord High Steward for the occa&s;ion, and twenty-eight other Peers. Anne, appearing at the bar, was charged with criminal conver&s;ation with her brother and the other four; as al&s;o with having con&s;pired the death of the King. She pleaded not guilty, and an&s;wered di&s;tinctly all the evidence pro|duced again&s;t her. As &s;he was not confronted by Smeton, it was &s;uppo&s;ed that he had bore fal&s;e wit|ne&s;s; for all the others denied the charge. Never|thele&s;s, &s;he was convicted, and condemned to be burned or beheaded, at the King's plea&s;ure. Her brother likewi&s;e was found guilty, and &s;entenced to be beheaded and quartered. Henry, not &s;atisfied with this vengeance, was de&s;irous of &s;eeing her daughter Elizabeth declared illegitimate. He remembered a report of a previous contract between Lord Piercy, then Earl of Northumberland, and Anne Boleyn. The Earl, being que&s;tioned on this &s;ubject, declared, that no &s;uch contract had ever exi&s;ted. He &s;wore to this declaration on the &s;acrament, which he wi&s;hed might be his damnation if he did not &s;peak the truth. How|ever, the Queen was tampered with in &s;uch a manner, either by promi&s;e of life, or threats of executing the &s;entence in all its rigour, that &s;he confe&s;&s;ed &s;uch a precontract before the afflicted Primate, and &s;ome other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction: and her marriage with the King was declared null and in&s;ufficient. This &s;entence, however, palpably contradicted the other which had been pronounced again&s;t her: for, if her marriage with Henry was null from the beginning, &s;he could not be ju&s;tly attainted for adultery. In two days after this declaration, &s;he was ordered to be ex|ecuted on the green in the Tower. She is &s;aid to have written a letter to the King, when &s;he fir&s;t under&s;tood the cau&s;e of her confinement. Such an addre&s;s was afterwards found among the papers of Thomas Crom|well, drawn up with &s;uch pathetic eloquence and dig|nity of expre&s;&s;ion, as to do great honour to the author;
<PB N="434" REF="481">but it is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the production of &s;ome other per&s;on. On the day that preceded her execution, &s;he de&s;ired the wife of the Lieutenant of the Tower to &s;it down in the chair of &s;tate: then kneeling before her, and &s;hedding a flood of tears, &s;he conjured her to go, in her name, and a&s;k pardon of the Prince&s;s Mary, for the har&s;hne&s;s with which &s;he had been treated. On the morning of her execution, &s;he &s;ent for the Lieutenant, that he might be pre&s;ent at her re|ceiving the ma&s;s, and declaring her own innocence. She &s;aid, &s;he was &s;orry to hear her death was delayed till the afternoon, becau&s;e, before that time, &s;he had expected to be out of her pain. Then &s;he inquired about the dexterity of the executioner; fixed her hands about her neck, ob&s;erving that it was very little, and laughed heartily. When &s;he was brought to the &s;caffold, in pre&s;ence of the Duke of Rich|mond<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This vas Henry Fitzroy, the King's natural &s;on, by Elizabeth, daughter of Sir&mdash;Blount, and widow of Sir Gilbert Taillebois.

She prayed that God would pre&s;erve the King, who had been always to her a mo&s;t merciful, good, and gentle Sovereign; and wi&s;hed that people would judge of him with charity. She took leave of all the &s;pectators, de&s;iring they would pray for her; and after &s;he had &s;pent &s;ome time in devotion, her head was &s;evered from her body by the executioner of Calais, who was brought over for his dexterity in decapitation. Her corp&s;e was thrown into a common coffin, and buried in the Tower chapel, without any ceremony. Thus fell Anne Boleyn, who&s;e fate has been the &s;ubject of much controver&s;y. She is &s;aid to have been a lady of unaffected piety, and was certainly

His other daughter Elizabeth, then near three years of age, was deprived of the title of Prince&s;s of Wales, which &s;he had hitherto enjoyed; but the King carefully &s;uperintended her education, and treated her on all occa&s;ions with parental affec|tion.</P>
<P>Henry having convened a new parliament on June 8, that a&s;&s;embly enacted a &s;tatute,<NOTE PLACE="inter">The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown altered a &s;e|cond time.</NOTE> rever&s;ing the former act of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, declaring the children of the King's two fir&s;t marriages illegitimate, and excluded for ever from &s;ucceeding to the crown; confirming the condemnation of Anne Boleyn, adjudging the crown, after the King's death, to his i&s;&s;ue by Queen Jane, or any other wife he might afterwards e&s;pou&s;e; impower|ing Henry to regulate the manner in which they &s;hould &s;ucceed, either by will, or letters-patent under the great &s;eal; and declaring all tho&s;e, who &s;hould main|tain the validity of his fir&s;t marriages, guilty of high trea&s;on.</P>
<P>In order to deprive the Pope of all chance for reco|vering his &s;piritual juri&s;diction in England, this parli|ament pa&s;&s;ed an act, &s;ubjecting to the penalty of pre|munire every per&s;on who &s;hould, in any manner, at|tempt to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the authority of the Bi&s;hop of Rome in England; and likewi&s;e all magi&s;trates, who &s;hould neglect to put this law in execution. By an|other &s;tatute, they annulled and aboli&s;hed all di&s;pen&s;a|tions, exemptions, and privileges, derived from the court of Rome; &s;aving, however, to the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, the power of confirming what &s;hould be judged for the benefit of the church and people.

In &s;hort, Henry was determined to be ab&s;olute both in church and &s;tate. He had formed a religion of his own, and was re&s;olved that his &s;ubjects &s;hould embrace it.

In the&s;e propo&s;itions they had inferred many doctrines adopted by the Lutherans, ancient Lollards, and Anabapti&s;ts; in&s;inuating, that the reformers profe&s;&s;ed them all equally. At the &s;ame time their deputies complained loudly again&s;t innovations in religion, and tho&s;e by whom they were introduced, meaning Cranmer and Cromwell; who both, notwith&s;tanding the fate of Anne Boleyn, &s;till maintained their credit with the
<PB N="438" REF="485">King, who created Cromwell his Vicegerent in all ec|ele&s;ia&s;tical affairs. By Henry's order, this Vicar de|clared to the convocation, that the rites and ceremo|nies of the church &s;hould be reformed by the rules of &s;cripture; and, in a few days, he pre&s;ented to them a &s;et of articles, drawn up by the King him&s;elf, touch|ing the religious doctrines, that they might examine them, and make a faithful report of their deliberations on the &s;ubject. On this occa&s;ion, the friends and ene|mies of the reformation declared them&s;elves openly. Archbi&s;hop Cranmer was &s;econded by Thomas Good|rich Bi&s;hop of Ely, Nicholas Shaxton of Sali&s;bury, Hugh Latimer of Worce&s;ter, William Barlow of St. David's, Edward Fox of Hereford, and John Hil&s;ey of Roche&s;ter. At the head of the other party was Ed|ward Lee, Archbi&s;hop of York, &s;upported by John Stoke&s;ley Bi&s;hop of London, Cuthbert Ton&s;tal $word$ Durham, Stephen Gardiner of Winche&s;ter, John Long|land of Lincoln, Robert Sherburn of Chiche&s;ter, Richard Nix of Norwich, and John Kite of Carli&s;le. The&s;e were &s;ecret parti&s;ans of the Pope, with whom they hoped a reconciliation would one day be effected. Cranmer and Cromwell, however, had the King's ear, and per&s;uaded him, that the abu&s;es of which they de|manded an abolition, tended to the &s;upport of the Papal u&s;urpation.

<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Concerning the &s;acrament of penance we will, that all Bi&s;hops and Preachers &s;hall in&s;truct and teach our people committed by us unto their &s;piritual charge, that they ought and mu&s;t mo&s;t con&s;tantly believe, that that &s;acrament was in&s;tituted of Chri&s;t in the New Te&s;tament, as a thing &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for man's &s;alvation, that no man, which after his bapti&s;m is fallen again, and hath committed deadly &s;in, can without the &s;ame be &s;aved, or attain everla&s;ting life.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> That like as &s;uch men, which after bapti&s;m do fall again into &s;in, if they do not penance in this life, &s;hall undoubtedly be damned; even &s;o when&s;oever the &s;ame men &s;hall convert them&s;elves from their naughty life, and do &s;uch penance for the &s;ame, as Chri&s;t requireth of them, they &s;hall without doubt attain remi&s;&s;ion of their &s;ins, and &s;hall be &s;aved.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> That the &s;acrament of perfect penance, which Chri&s;t requireth of &s;uch manner of per&s;ons, con&s;i&s;teth of three parts; that is to &s;ay, contrition, confe&s;&s;ion, and the amendment of the former life, and a new obe|dient reconciliation unto the laws and will of God; that is to &s;ay, exterior acts in works of charity, ac|cording as they be commanded of God, which be called in &s;cripture, <HI>fructus digni poenitentia,</HI> the worthy fruits of penance.</P>
<P>Furthermore, as touching contrition, which is the fir&s;t part, we will that all Bi&s;hops and Preachers &s;hall in&s;truct and teach our people, committed by us unto their &s;piritual charge, that the &s;aid contrition con&s;i&s;teth in two &s;pecial parts, which mu&s;t always be conjoined together, and cannot be di&s;&s;evered, that is to &s;ay, the penitent and contrite man mu&s;t fir&s;t acknowledge the filthine&s;s and abomination of his own &s;in (unto which knowledge he is brought by hearing and con&s;idering the will of God, declared in his laws); and feeling
<PB N="446" REF="493">and perceiving in his own con&s;cience, that God is angry, and di&s;plea&s;ed with him for the &s;ame, he mu&s;t al&s;o conceive not only great &s;orrow and inward &s;hame, that he hath &s;o grievou&s;ly offended God, but al&s;o great fear of God's di&s;plea&s;ure towards him, con&s;idering he hath no works or merits of his own, which he may worthily lay before God, as &s;ufficient &s;atisfaction for his &s;ins: which done, then afterward with this fear, &s;hame, and &s;orrow, mu&s;t needs &s;ucceed and be conjoined the &s;econd part, that is to wit, a certain faith, tru&s;t, and confidence, of the mercy and goodne&s;s of God, whereby the penitent mu&s;t conceive certain hope and faith, that God will forgive him his &s;ins, and repute him ju&s;tified, and of the number of his elect children, not for the worthine&s;s of any merit or work done by the penitent, but for the only merits of the blood and pa&s;&s;ion of our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> That this certain faith and hope is gotten and al&s;o confirmed and made more &s;trong by the applying of Chri&s;t's words and promi&s;es of his grace and favour, contained in his go&s;pel and the &s;acrament in&s;tituted by him in the New Te&s;tament: and therefore to attain this certain faith, the &s;econd part of penance is nece&s;|&s;ary, that is to &s;ay, confe&s;&s;ion to a prie&s;t, if it may be had; for the ab&s;olution given by the prie&s;t was in&s;tituted of Chri&s;t, to apply the promi&s;es of God's grace and favour to the penitent.</P>

<P><HI>Item,</HI> That &s;inners attain this ju&s;tification by con|trition, and faith joined with charity, after &s;uch &s;ort and manner as we before mentioned and declared: not as tho' our contrition or faith, or any works proceed|ing thereof, can worthily merit or de&s;erve to attain the &s;aid ju&s;tification; for the only mercy and grace of the Father, promi&s;ed freely unto us for his Son's &s;ake Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the merits of his blood and pa&s;&s;ion, be the only &s;ufficient and worthy cau&s;es thereof. And yet, that notwith&s;tanding to the attaining of the &s;ame ju&s;tification God requireth to be in us not only in|ward contrition, perfect faith and charity, certain hope and confidence, with all other &s;piritual graces and motions, which, as we &s;aid before, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily concur in the remi&s;&s;ion of our &s;ins, that is to &s;ay, our ju&s;tification: but al&s;o he requireth and commandeth us, that, after we be ju&s;tified, we mu&s;t al&s;o have good works of charity, and obedience towards God, in the ob&s;erving and fulfilling outwardly of his laws and commandments; for although acceptation to everla&s;t|ing life, be conjoined with ju&s;tification, yet our good works be nece&s;&s;arily required, to the attaining of ever|la&s;ting life: and we, being ju&s;tified, be nece&s;&s;arily bound, and it is our nece&s;&s;ary duty to do good works, according to the &s;aying of St. Paul, <HI>Debitores &s;umus non carni, ut &s;ecundum vivamus, nam &s;i &s;ecundum carnem vixerimus, moriemur.

And as for cen&s;ing of them, and kneeling and offering unto them, with other like wor&s;hips, although the &s;ame hath entered by devotion, and fallen to cu&s;tom, yet the people ought to be diligently taught, that they in no wi&s;e do it, nor think it meet to be done to the &s;ame images, but only to be done to God and in his honour, although it be done before the images, whether it be of Chri&s;t, of the Gro&s;s, of our Lady, or of any other Saint be&s;ide.</P>

<P>Fora&s;much as due order of charity requireth, and the book of Maccabees, and divers ancient doctors, plainly &s;hew, that it is a very good and charitable deed to pray for &s;ouls departed: and fora&s;much al&s;o as &s;uch u&s;age hath continued in the church &s;o many years, even from the beginning, we will, that all Bi&s;hops and Preachers &s;hall in&s;truct and teach our people, committed by us unto their &s;piritual charge, that no man ought to be grieved with the continuance of the &s;ame, and that it &s;tandeth with the very due order of charity, a Chri&s;tian man to pray for &s;ouls departed, and to com|mit them in our prayers to God's mercy, and al&s;o to cau&s;e others to pray for them in ma&s;&s;es and exequies, and to give alms to others to pray for them, whereby they may be relieved and holpen of &s;ome part of their pain. But fora&s;much as the place where they be, the name thereof, and kind of pains there al&s;o, be to us uncertain by &s;cripture, therefore this, with all other things, we remit to Almighty God, into who&s;e mercy it is mete and convenient for us to recommend them,

<P>The&s;e con&s;titutions or articles, (commonly called Henry VIII.'s creed) were &s;igned by Thomas Crom|well, the King's Vicar-general, Archbi&s;hop Cranmer, &s;eventeen Bi&s;hops, forty Abbots or Priors, and fifty Archdeacons or deputies from the lower-hou&s;e of con|vocation, among whom were two Italians, viz. Peter Vannes, Archdeacon of Worce&s;ter, and &s;ometime one of the King's agents at Rome to &s;olicit the divorce, and Polydore Virgil, who was Archdeacon of Wells, and wrote a Latin hi&s;tory of England, and was the la&s;t Collector of Peter Pence in this kingdom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The rea&s;on why confirmation is not mentioned in the pre|ceding articles, may partly appear from the an&s;wers to the following que&s;tions, pre&s;erved in manu&s;cript in the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum. The fir&s;t three an&s;wers are &s;aid to be by John Capon Bi&s;hop of Bangor, and the other three by Archbi&s;hop Cranmer.
<P>Que&s;tion I. Whether the &s;acrament of confirmation be of the New Te&s;tament in&s;titution, or not?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. Not of Chri&s;t, but &s;ince the time of the New Te&s;tament preached &s;o far as we know by &s;cripture; but of the foot&s;teps of the church.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion II. What is the outward &s;ign and thing &s;ignified in this &s;acrament?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I an&s;wer, the outward &s;igns be the unctions with chri&s;m, and certain words thereunto appointed. As to the invi&s;ible grace promi&s;ed by &s;cripture, we find none; but, by Doctors, we find that thereby is given gho&s;tly &s;trength to confe&s;s boldly the faith, and to re&s;i&s;t the temptations of the adver&s;ary.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion III. What promi&s;es be made that the &s;aid gifts &s;hall be received by this &s;acrament?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I an&s;wer, as to the promi&s;e made by &s;cripture we find none. The Doctors only write, that by this &s;acrament be received the gifts above-mentioned.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion I. Whether confirmation be in&s;tituted by Chri&s;t?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. There is no place in &s;cripture that declareth this &s;acra|ment to be in&s;tituted by Chri&s;t; for, fir&s;t, the places alledged for the &s;ame be no in&s;titution, but the acts and deeds of the apo&s;tles. Se|condly, tho&s;e acts and deeds were done for &s;pecial u&s;e by the apo&s;tles for the confirmation of the godly word &s;poken at that time.

<P>Que&s;tion II. What is the external &s;ign?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. The church u&s;eth cream for the exterior &s;ign, but the &s;cripture maketh no mention thereof.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. III. What is the efficacy of this &s;acrament?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. The Bi&s;hop, in the name of the church, doth invocate the Holy Gho&s;t, to give &s;trength and con&s;tancy, with other &s;piritual gifts, unto the per&s;on confirmed; &s;o that the efficacy of this &s;acra|ment is of &s;uch value, as is the prayer of the Bi&s;hop made in the name of the church.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>As the Pope had called a general council at Mantua, where he expected to be ma&s;ter of all debates, the convocation, on July 20, the la&s;t day of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, declared their opinion, "That, though nothing was better in&s;tituted by the ancient fathers, for the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the faith, the extirpation of here&s;ies, the heal|ing of &s;chi&s;ms, and the unity of the Chri&s;tian church, than general councils, gathered in the Holy Gho&s;t, duly called to an indifferent place, with other nece&s;&s;ary requi&s;ites; &s;o, on the other hand, nothing would pro|duce more baleful effects, than a general council called upon private malice, ambition, or other carnal motives; and Chri&s;tian Princes, by who&s;e general con&s;ent it was to be called, ought to u&s;e their endeavours to prevent &s;o great a mi&s;chief." The King, &s;atisfied with this deci&s;ion of his clergy, publi&s;hed a prote&s;t again&s;t the council &s;ummoned to meet at Mantua; &s;hewing, "That the Pope had no power to call one, it belong|ing now to Chri&s;tian Princes, as it formerly did to the Emperors; that the Pope had no juri&s;diction in Eng|land, and could &s;ummon none from thence; that the place was neither &s;afe nor proper, and nothing could be done to any purpo&s;e if the Pope pre&s;ided in it, &s;ince one of the chief rea&s;ons, for de&s;iring a council, was, the reducing his power within its old limit; that he much de&s;ired a free general council, but he was &s;ure this could not be &s;o, the Pope having called it at a time when the Emperor and the King of France were at war, knowing that few would come to it, and he might carry things as he plea&s;ed; that it was un&s;afe for any Engli&s;hman to go to Mantua, and Popes had &s;o often broke their oaths and promi&s;es, that there was no relying on their &s;afe-conducts; that him&s;elf had no rea&s;on to tru&s;t the Pope, who had, for three years pa&s;t, been &s;tirring up all Chri&s;tendom again&s;t him, and tried all ways po&s;&s;ible to create him trouble; that he would
<PB N="460" REF="507">not go to any council called by a Bi&s;hop of Rome; but, in ca&s;e of a general peace between Chri&s;tian Princes, would gladly hearken to a true general coun|cil, and, in the mean time, would pre&s;erve all the ar|ticles of faith in his kingdom." It was on the&s;e ac|counts, that he prote&s;ted again&s;t any council's being held at Mantua, or any where el&s;e, by the Bi&s;hop of Rome's authority, and declared, he would neither ac|knowledge it, nor receive any of its decrees.</P>
<P>The people of England, who had long groaned un|der the burthen of Papal exactions, were generally plea&s;ed with the aboli&s;hing the Pope's &s;upremacy; but were not &s;o well &s;atisfied with the late &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of religious hou&s;es; thinking it as well unju&s;t, that they &s;hould be de&s;troyed for the delinquency of a few indi|viduals, as &s;acrilegious, that what the piety of their ance&s;tors had dedicated to God, &s;hould be converted to prophane u&s;es. The gentry u&s;ed to provide for their younger children, and decayed friends, in tho&s;e hou&s;es, and to be entertained them&s;elves at the Abbots tables: travellers were lodged there, and the poor relieved, by the alms daily di&s;tributed at mona&s;teries. The act of parliament, which &s;uppre&s;&s;ed them, obliged the far|mers, to whom the &s;cites of convents were lea&s;ed by the crown, to keep up the u&s;ual ho&s;pitality; and the King &s;old the hou&s;es and lands to gentlemen at the ea&s;ier rates for that purpo&s;e, and to make it their intere&s;t to &s;upport what had been done: but this ho&s;pitality was probably not exerci&s;ed, even at fir&s;t, with the &s;ame freedom and plenty, as it had been done by the Monks, and was, in a little time, dropped entirely. Books had been written, to expo&s;e the vices, crimes, and impo&s;tures of the religious: but this did not hinder their being pitied, when &s;hoals of them, wandering from place to place, in a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and begging con|dition, told their own tale, and complained of the cruelty or impiety of their treatment.

To countenance the&s;e pretences, which gained them many partizans, they re&s;tored the religious to &s;everal di&s;&s;olved mona&s;teries; and, to draw in the common people, gave out, "that the King de&s;igned to get all the gold of England into his own hands, under colour of recoining it; that he would &s;eize all unmarked cat|tle, and all the ornaments of pari&s;h-churches; and they &s;hould be forced to pay for chri&s;tenings, mar|riages, and burials (orders having been given for keeping regi&s;ters thereof) and for licences to eat white bread." Edward Lee, Archbi&s;hop of York, and Thomas Lord Darcy, both &s;u&s;pected of promoting the in&s;urrection, were in Pontefract ca&s;tle; and &s;urrender|ing it to them, took their oath of engagement. The in&s;urgents reduced York and Hull: but the ca&s;tles of Skipton and Scarborough held out again&s;t all their ef|forts; the fir&s;t being defended by Henry Clifford, Earl of Cumberland, although he was for&s;aken by 500 gen|tlemen, whom he retained at his own expences; and the latter by Sir Ralph Euers, though he and his gar|ri&s;on ta&s;ted no other food for four and twenty hours than &s;imple bread and water.</P>

Henry propo&s;ed to follow in per&s;on with a greater body; and had i&s;&s;ued a general &s;ummons for all his nobility to meet him, on November 7, at Northampton; but was diverted from it by Norfolk and Shrew&s;bury, who thought the be&s;t way of reducing the rebels, was to gain them by amu|&s;ing them with treaties; their number being &s;o very great, that they could not keep long together for want of provi&s;ions. The Earl &s;ent an herald to them with a proclamation, requiring them to lay down their arms, and &s;ubmit to the King's mercy: but A&s;ke, who a&s;|&s;umed all the &s;tate of a Prince, rather than of a gene|ral, would not &s;uffer it to be read, when he under|&s;tood the contents. The King's troops did not exceed 5000 men; and with the&s;e the noblemen took po&s;t at Donca&s;ter, fortifying the bridge, and lining the river with their men, to hinder the rebels marching &s;outh|wards. A&s;ke, with an army at lea&s;t &s;ix times more numerous, had re&s;olved to force a pa&s;&s;age: but heavy rains falling on the two days he had appointed for that purpo&s;e, the fords became unpa&s;&s;able; and Norfolk made u&s;e of that di&s;appointment to engage him in a treaty. This afforded an opportunity for &s;ome agents he had employed among the rebels to in&s;inuate, that their leaders were making terms for them&s;elves, and would leave the re&s;t to be hanged or ruined. The poorer &s;ort, whom A&s;ke would not &s;uffer to plunder the country for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, were already reduced to great nece&s;&s;ities; and hearkening the more readily to
<PB N="465" REF="512">the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions, di&s;banded apace. Norfolk, &s;eeing the &s;ucce&s;s of his mea&s;ures, propo&s;ed their &s;ending de|puties to court with their demands; oftering to go along with them, and intercede in their behalf. This he knew would take up &s;ome time, and mo&s;t of them would di&s;per&s;e before his return. Sir Robert Ellerker, and Robert Bowes, two gentlemen that had been taken at Hull, and forced to go with them, were &s;ent to Wind&s;or; and the an&s;wer was delayed, till mo&s;t of them had di&s;banded: but the King, hearing that they had engaged to return upon notice, and that they re|&s;ented their not receiving an an&s;wer, &s;ent the Duke of Norfolk to them with a general pardon; &s;ix only ex|cepted by name, and four others not named. As the in&s;urgents had no pro&s;pect of &s;ufficient redre&s;s of their complaints, and every one dreading him&s;elf to be one of the four, they rejected the propo&s;al; though the King, to pacify them a little, had, by new injunctions, ordered all the u&s;ual ceremonies of the church to be continued by the clergy.</P>
<P>It was nece&s;&s;ary to come to a new treaty with the rebels; and 300 of them had &s;afe-conducts for coming, on December 6, to Donca&s;ter, where it was to be &s;et|tled with his Maje&s;ty's commi&s;&s;ioners. There were hopes, that, in &s;o great a number, &s;ome might fall out with the re&s;t, and di&s;agree in what was to be a&s;k|ed: but as this had been adju&s;ted in a meeting of the clergy, that &s;ided with the in&s;urgents, at Pontefract, they all agreed in their demands. The&s;e were, "a general pardon; a parliament to be held at York; courts of ju&s;tice to be fixed there, for deciding all law|&s;uits north of Trent; a repeal of the acts of parlia|ment for u&s;es; for making words mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea|&s;on; for the clergy's paying tenths and fir&s;t-fruits to the King; and for the la&s;t &s;ub&s;idy. They de&s;ired the Prince&s;s Mary might be re&s;tored to her right of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, the Pope to his late juri&s;diction, and the reli|gious to their convents; that the Lutherans might be
<PB N="466" REF="513">puni&s;hed; that Audeley, the Lord Chancellor, and Cromwell, Lord Privy Seal, might be excluded from the next parliament; and that Lee and Leighton, who had vi&s;ited the mona&s;teries, might be impri&s;oned for bribery and extortion." The rebels made &s;ome other reque&s;ts, but in &s;uch general terms, that the King ea|&s;ily put them off with a general an&s;wer; and the Duke of Norfolk writing him word with regard to the re&s;t, that he thought a general pardon; and a parliament in the North, would content them, the King, on De|cember 9, granted them, under the great &s;eal, a ge|neral and free pardon of all rebellions, trea&s;ons, fe|lonies, and tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, to that day, if they made their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Duke of Norfolk and Earl of Shrew&s;|bury, and did not repeat their offence. The&s;e terms being accepted, the rebels di&s;per&s;ed; and Norfolk and Shrew&s;bury being ordered to &s;tay in the country with their forces till things were fully compo&s;ed, brought them all to an entire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; obliging them to re|nounce their oaths made during the rebellion, and to take a new one for their future good behaviour. The Lord Darcy and A&s;ke were &s;ent to London, where the former was impri&s;oned in the Tower; but the latter was well received, the King having a mind either to engage him in his &s;ervice, or to get from him a di&s;co|very of &s;uch abbots as had furni&s;hed money, and of other per&s;ons in different parts of the realm, who had favoured the York&s;hire in&s;urrection.</P>

Two gentlemen of Cumberland, Nicholas Mu&s;grave and Thomas Tilby, $$$&s;ing a body of 8000 men, attacked Carli&s;le: but

Sir Fran|cis Biggot, and one Helam, attempting to &s;urpri&s;e Hull, were taken and executed. There were &s;everal other ri&s;ings in the country, and A&s;ke, quitting the court without leave, had embarked in one of them; but they were &s;oon cru&s;hed. The pretence for them was, that a parliament was not held at York, as had been promi&s;ed: but the King &s;aid, the rebels had not kept conditions with him, and he would not call one till all was quiet. The Duke of Norfolk, di&s;playing the royal banner, executed martial law, where ever he &s;aw it requi&s;ite; A&s;ke was pu$ to death at Hull; other gentlemen, with &s;ome abbots and priors, at York, and in different towns of that county. The Lord Darcy was beheaded on Tower-hill, and the Lord Hu&s;&s;ey at Lincoln. The former, at his trial, accu&s;ed the Duke of Norfolk of having encouraged the rebels to per&s;i&s;t in their demands: but this nobleman's great &s;ervices &s;et him above all &s;u&s;picion. The Duke denied the charge, and offered to clear him&s;elf by &s;ingle combat: but the King declared him&s;elf &s;atisfied with his con|duct. The executions were not all over till June; and the King, in the next month, publi&s;hed a general amne&s;ty all over the North, which was received with great joy, and, putting an end to people's fears, re|e&s;tabli&s;hed the quiet of the country.</P>

The bull, which Pope Paul III had &s;igned, upon the execution of Cardinal Fi&s;her, and Sir Thomas More<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See pages 423 and 426 of this volume.</NOTE>, for depriving Henry of his crown, ab&s;olving his &s;ubjects from their allegiance, and forbidding all commerce with his kingdom, and which, after &s;ending copies of it to &s;everal European courts, had been &s;u&s;pended during plea&s;ure, was now publi&s;h|ed, and every Chri&s;tian potentate exhorted to make war with the King of England.</P>
<P>The Pope found no in&s;trument &s;o capable and ready to execute his bull, and &s;erve his intere&s;t, as Reginald Pole (the younge&s;t of four &s;ons which Sir Richard Pole had by his wife Margaret, Counte&s;s of Sali&s;bury, daughter of George Duke of Clarence, brother to Ed|ward IV. and) &s;econd cou&s;in to Henry. The King had taken a particular care of his education, bred him up in Magdelen and Corpus Chri&s;ti colleges at Oxford, given him the deanery of Exeter, maintained him a|broad with a noble allowance for &s;even years, whil&s;t he pro&s;ecuted his &s;tudies at Paris and Padua; where he formed a very u&s;eful acquaintance, and made a great progre&s;s in learning. Henry at la&s;t calling him home, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in his affairs, he declined the invitation; and, when his excu&s;es could not prevail for further delays, he wrote the King word, that he did not approve his actions, either in the point of his divorce, or in his aboli&s;hing the papal &s;upremacy. When the rea&s;ons of his di&s;approbation were a&s;ked, he wrote a book, in|titled, <HI>De Unione Eccle&s;ia&s;tica,</HI> wherein he depre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="476" REF="525">the royal, and exalted the papal authority; condemned the King's conduct, and pre&s;&s;ed him to return to the obedience of the &s;ee of Rome, with many &s;harp re|flections, and indecent expre&s;&s;ions, which might have been omitted, without hurting his cau&s;e, or expo&s;ing him to the charge of ingratitude for Henry's favours. His book was an&s;wered by Ton&s;tal, Stoke&s;ley, and Gardiner; but it recommended him &s;o much to the Pope's good graces, that he was, on May 22, 1536, created a Cardinal. Thus li&s;ted into the &s;ervice of the court of Rome, he was &s;ent with the character of le|gate into the Low Countries, that he might be near England, for the ea&s;ier keeping up a corre&s;pondence with the Papal faction: and the late rebellion was &s;up|po&s;ed to have been the effect of his intrigues. He was to pa&s;s by Paris in his way thither, and perhaps and &s;ome commi&s;&s;ion to that court: but Henry, aware of the de&s;ign, and in&s;i&s;ting with Francis, either to deny him pa&s;&s;age thro' his realm, or to deliver him up as a rebel, or at lea&s;t not to treat with him as a legate, he was obliged to quit the French territories. The King had u&s;ed the like in&s;tances with Mary Queen of Hun|gary, Regent of the Low Countries; but &s;he replying, that it was not fit for her to refu&s;e the Pope's Legate, Pole was at fir&s;t treated agreeably to that character when he arrived at Cambray. Having probably &s;ome view upon the crown of England for him&s;elf, or his elde&s;t brother Henry Lord Montacute, or perhaps &s;ome &s;e|cret inclinations for the Prince&s;s Mary, he was, during his &s;tay there very inqui&s;itive to learn, whether the phy&s;icians thought the Queen then pregnant would have a made child or a female? Henry did not want intelligence of his actions; and renewing his in&s;tances with the Regent, charged her reception of &s;uch a traitor as a breach of the treaty; the con&s;equences of which, as the Emp$$$r was at war with France, &s;he had rea&s;on to apprehend. Pole was thereupon ordered to be gone, and told, that, &s;ince he was an Engli&s;h|man
<PB N="477" REF="526">of &s;o high a quality, his negotiation could not be a &s;ecret, and might do her great prejudice. To remove the King's &s;u&s;picions, he wrote Cromwell, on May 2, 1537, an apology for his conduct, couch|ed in general and equivocal terms; and &s;$nt the Re|gent a remon&s;trance, accu&s;ing her of di&s;obedience to the &s;ee of Rome, prote&s;ting again&s;t his treatment, &s;uch as had never been u&s;ed to any legate, and pre|tending that his chief bu&s;ine&s;s there, was only to di&s;|pute the errors of the Engli&s;h reformation. Neither of his applications &s;ucceeded; the Regent did not like that the dominions, under her care, &s;hould be troubled with di&s;putations about religion; and Pole, being forced to depart, removed to Liege; where he carried on, for &s;ome time, a clande&s;tine corre&s;pondence with the di&s;contented party in England. Returning, in October, to Rome, he was con&s;ulted in all mea&s;ures relating to Henry; and &s;till kept up that corre&s;pon|dence, which proved fatal to &s;everal of his friends, and neare&s;t relations.</P>
<P>The King of England, being made acquainted with the Pope's publication of the before-mentioned bull, exacted of the Bi&s;hops and Abbots a new oath, by which they renounced the Roman Pontiff's authority. About the &s;ame time, he ordered the clergy to read the Lord's prayer, the confe&s;&s;ion of &s;aith, and the ten commandments, in Engli&s;h. They were directed to recommend good works, and teach the people, that relics, ro&s;aries, and &s;uch like, were unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;al|vation. All the images to which devotees made of|ferings, were pulled down, and all tapers taken away, except tho&s;e that burned before the repre&s;entation of Chri&s;t: and the King &s;uppre&s;&s;ed all the invocations of <HI>O$e pro nobis</HI> added to the prayers addre&s;&s;ed to &s;aints.</P>
<P>Henry, by the&s;e injunctions, gave a mortal blow to the old religion, and was &s;o ab&s;olute, both as tem|poral &s;overeign, and as &s;upreme head of the church, that no per&s;on would venture to expre&s;s publickly the lea&s;t
<PB N="478" REF="527">di&s;approbation of his actions, either in a regal or pon|tifical capacity. Gardiner, Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, who dete&s;ted the reformation in his heart, &s;o far in|&s;inuated him&s;elf into the King's confidence, by an out|ward approbation of his mea&s;ures, that his Maje&s;ty li&s;tened to the &s;ugge&s;tions again&s;t the Sacramentarians, or tho&s;e who denied the real pre&s;ence of the Euchari&s;t; and in this the Bi&s;hop was the more &s;ucce&s;sful, as Henry him&s;elf was &s;trongly attached to the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation. Gardiner, who knew the King's impatience of contradiction in any, but e&s;pecially re|ligious, matters, imagined that the zeal of tho&s;e who favoured the reformation, when per&s;ecuted, would ir|ritate the temper of the impetuous Henry, and that his Maje&s;ty would cru&s;h them during the prevalence of his indignation. Gardiner, moreover, repre&s;ented to the King, that nothing could &s;o effectually &s;ecure to him the friend&s;hip of tho&s;e engaged in the league of Smalcalde, or di&s;appoint the machinations of the court of Rome, as a vigorous per&s;ecution again&s;t his &s;ubjects, who dared to differ from him in the e&s;tabli&s;hed opinion of the real pre&s;ence. Intere&s;t and vanity con&s;pired to make Henry li&s;ten to the in&s;inuations of the artful pre|late, and a vigorous per&s;ecution was rai&s;ed again&s;t the Sacramentarians.</P>
