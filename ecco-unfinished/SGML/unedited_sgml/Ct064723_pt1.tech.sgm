<HEAD>THE
EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>_I WAS invited to pa&s;s a mon$h
la&s;t &s;ummer in Buckingham|&s;hire
by a friend, who paid an|nually
a vi&s;it to his mother: a
lady pretty far advanced in years,
but extremely chearful, &s;en&s;ible, and well-bred.</P>
<P>She lived altogether in the country, in
a good old fa&s;hioned hou&s;e, which was
part of her jointure; and it was to this
ho&s;pitable man&s;ion he carried me.</P>
<P>The lady received me very politely,
as her &s;on's friend; and I have great rea|&s;on
to be obliged to him for the introduction.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="4">
My friend and I generally dedicated
our evenings to the entertainment of this
obliging Lady. She loved reading, and
was a woman of an excellent ta&s;te; but
as her years rendered that employment
not &s;o ea&s;y to her as it had been, her &s;on
and my&s;elf u&s;ually &s;pared her the ta&s;k,
and read to her &s;uch authors as &s;he cho&s;e
for her entertainment; nor was &s;he &s;o con|fined
to particular &s;tudies, as not to al|low
us to vary our &s;ubjects as inclination
led us.</P>
<P>It happened one evening, which was
on the eve of the day appointed for our
departure, that we had made choice of
the tragedy of Douglas for our entertain|ment,
when a neighbouring lady (a &s;en&s;i|ble
woman) who had drank tea with us,
de&s;ired to make one of our auditors.</P>
<P>After the tea-table was removed, we
entered on our ta&s;k; my friend and I
reading alternately, to relieve each other,
that we might not injure the performance
by a wearied or flat delivery.</P>
<P>Neither of the ladies had ever &s;een or
read this play before; and both gave that
true te&s;timony of nature to its merit,
tears.</P>
<P>When we had fini&s;hed the reading of
it, they each in her turn be&s;towed high
prai&s;es on it; but the vi&s;itor lady &s;aid,
<PB N="3" REF="5">
that notwith&s;tanding the plea&s;ure it had
afforded her upon the whole, &s;he had one
great objection to it. We were all im|patient
to know what it was. I think,
&s;aid &s;he, that the moral which it incul|cates
is a di&s;couraging le&s;&s;on, e&s;pecially
to youth; for the blooming hero of this
&s;tory, though adorned with the highe&s;t
virtues of humanity, truth, mode&s;ty, gra|titude,
filial piety, noblene&s;s of mind,
and valour in the mo&s;t eminent degree,
is not only buried in ob&s;curity, by a &s;e|vere
de&s;tiny, 'till he arrives at manhood,
but when he emerges into light, is &s;udden|ly
cut off by an untimely death, and that
at a juncture too, when we might (mo|rally
&s;peaking) &s;ay his virtues <HI>ought</HI> to
have been rewarded.</P>
<P>We each &s;poke our thoughts on the
&s;ubject, as opinion led us, when the old
lady drew our attention, which &s;he al|ways
does, whenever &s;he delivers her &s;en|timents.</P>
<P>I &s;hould think as you do, madam, &s;aid
&s;he, if there were not too many melancho|ly
precedents to give a &s;anction to the fable
of that tragedy. I do not &s;ay but that the
poet, who is at liberty to di&s;po&s;e as he plea|&s;es
of the works of his own creation, may
as well reward and puni&s;h according to the
mea&s;ures of ju&s;tice in this life; it might
<PB N="4" REF="6">
perhaps make a better impre&s;&s;ion, and in|deed
afford a more prevalent example to
the generality of young people. I &s;ay
therefore, I do not take upon me to
defend an oppo&s;ite conduct upon princi|ples
of poetic ju&s;tice, but &s;urely the
poet who prefers that cour&s;e, may be
ju&s;tified in it from every day's experi|ence.
If we always &s;aw virtuous people
&s;ucce&s;sful in their pur&s;uits, and their days
crowned with pro&s;perity, there would be
more force in your objection; but the di|rect
contrary is a truth, which every body
who has lived but a moderate number of
years, mu&s;t have been convinced of from
their own ob&s;ervation. Among&s;t heathens
indeed, who looked no farther than <HI>this</HI>
life for good and evil, and who&s;e only in|citement
to virtue was the prai&s;e of men,
or what <HI>they</HI> called glory, &s;uch morals
might be dangerous; but &s;urely among&s;t us
Chri&s;tians they <HI>cannot,</HI> at lea&s;t <HI>ought</HI> not to
have any ill effect.</P>
<P>On the contrary, I think it &s;hould &s;erve
to confirm that great le&s;&s;on which we are
all taught indeed, but which we &s;eldom
think of reducing to practice, <HI>viz.</HI> to u&s;e
the good things of this life with that in|difference,
which things that are neither
permanent in their own nature, nor of any
e&s;timation in the &s;ight of God, de&s;erve.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7">
On the other hand, to con&s;ider the evils
which befall us, as equally temporary, and
no more di&s;pen&s;ed by the great ruler of all
things for puni&s;hments, than the others are
for rewards; and by thus e&s;timating both,
to look forward for an equal di&s;tribution of
ju&s;tice, to that place only, where (let our
&s;tation be what it will) our lot is to be un|changeable.
It is in this light that I was in|&s;tructed
in my early days, to con&s;ider the va|rious
portions that fall to the &s;hare of man|kind;
which very often, as far as we can
&s;ee, appear extremely partial; and no doubt
would really be &s;o, were there not an invi&s;i|ble
world where the di&s;tributions are ju&s;t and
equal. From this reflection I have drawn
comfort in many trying incidents of my life;
but in none more than the unhappy fate of
a lady, who was my particular friend; and
who, tho' a woman of mo&s;t exemplary
virtue, was, thro' the cour&s;e of her whole
life, per&s;ecuted by a variety of &s;trange mi&s;|fortunes.
This lady, to u&s;e your expre&s;&s;ion,
madam (addre&s;&s;ing her friend), to all hu|man
appearance, <HI>ought</HI> at la&s;t to have been
rewarded even here&mdash;but her portion was
affliction. What then are we to conclude?
but, that God does not e&s;timate things as
we do. It is ignorant, as well as &s;inful, to
arraign his providence. We daily &s;ee its
di&s;pen&s;ations with our own eyes, in the va|rious
<PB N="6" REF="8">
accidents of life. Why &s;hould we
not then allow the poet to copy from life,
and exhibit to our view events, the proba|bility
of which are founded on general ex|perience?</P>
<P>We are indeed &s;o much u&s;ed to what
they call poetical ju&s;tice, that we are di&s;ap|pointed
in the cata&s;trophe of a fable, if e|very
body concerned in it be not di&s;po&s;ed
of according to the &s;entence of that judge
which we have &s;et up in our own brea&s;ts.</P>
<P>The contrary we know happens in real
life; let us not then condemn what is drawn
from real life.&mdash;We may wi&s;h to &s;ee nature
copied from her more plea&s;ing works; but
a martyr expiring in tortures, is as ju&s;t,
though not as agreeable, a repre&s;entation of
her, as a hero rewarded with the brighte&s;t
honours.</P>
<P>We agreed with the venerable lady in
her ob&s;ervations; and her &s;on taking oc|ca&s;ion
from her mentioning that unfortunate
per&s;on, who was her friend, told her, he
would take it as a particular favour, if &s;he
would oblige me with the &s;ight of that la|dy's
&s;tory.</P>
<P>She an&s;wered, that as we had fixed upon
the next day for our departure, there would
not be time for me to peru&s;e it, but that &s;he
would entru&s;t me with it to take it to town,
that I might read it at my lei&s;ure. It is
<PB N="7" REF="9">
drawn up, &s;aid &s;he, for the mo&s;t part, by
the lady her&s;elf, and the occa&s;ion of its be|ing
&s;o was this. She and I had been inti|mate
from our childhood; we were play-fellows
when young, and con&s;tant compa|nions
as we grew up. We always called
each other &s;i&s;ter, and loved as well as if we
had really borne that relation&s;hip to each
other. It was our continual practice, from
children, to keep little journals of what dai|ly
happened to us; the&s;e, in all our &s;hort
ab&s;ences, were matter of great entertain|ment
to us; we con&s;tantly communicated
them when we met, or if we chanced to be
&s;eparated by any di&s;tance, we made a mu|tual
exchange by the po&s;t of our little diur|nal
regi&s;ters, having made each a &s;olemn
promi&s;e, not to conceal an incident, or even
a thought, of the lea&s;t moment, from the
other; and this promi&s;e I believe was reli|giou&s;ly
kept up during a corre&s;pondence of
many years.</P>
<P>I had a brother about three years older
than my&s;elf; a very promi&s;ing young man.
He was an only &s;on, and the darling of his
parents: when he had fini&s;hed his &s;tudies,
my father thought of &s;ending him abroad,
but his fondne&s;s for him made him re&s;olve
to accompany him him&s;elf.</P>
<P>A better tutor or a better guide he could
not have found for him; my father was
<PB N="8" REF="10">
then in the prime of life, he had no other
children but him and me. My mother,
as fond of me as he was of his &s;on, and per|fectly
affectionate to my father, expre&s;&s;ed
her wi&s;h to let both her and me be of this
party. She &s;aid, &s;he thought a young lady,
under proper conduct, might improve as
much by &s;eeing foreign courts, and the va|rious
cu&s;toms of different nations, as a young
gentleman.</P>
<P>I was then about &s;ixteen: my father rea|dily
con&s;ented, as he perfectly loved my
mother; and we all four &s;et out on our
tour together. It was my lot, after I had been
&s;ome time abroad, to marry an Engli&s;h gen|tleman,
then re&s;ident at Vienna! this occa|&s;ioned
my continuing there &s;ome years, and
it was during that &s;pace of time, that I had
the occurrences of my friend's life from her
own hand. As &s;he had kept up to the me|thod
we had agreed on of communicating
every thing that happened, even to trivial
matters, it generally increa&s;ed the bulk of
the packets I u&s;ed to receive from her, to a
prodigious &s;ize: the&s;e &s;he &s;ent off occa&s;ion|ally,
at nearer or more di&s;tant periods of
time, according as I gave her the opportu|nity,
by letting her know our motions.</P>
<P>I have from tho&s;e papers &s;elected the
mo&s;t material parts of her hi&s;tory, and con|nected
<PB N="9" REF="11">
them &s;o as to make one continued
narrative.</P>
<P>There were long intervals of time be|tween
many of the mo&s;t important incidents
of her life; but as the pa&s;&s;ages which inter|vened
were either &s;oreign to the main &s;cope
of her &s;tory, or too trivial to be recorded,
in copying her papers they were omitted.</P>
<P>I have my&s;elf prefixed to her &s;tory a ve|ry
brief account of the lady's family.</P>
<P>Thus much, Sir, added the good lady,
I thought nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e to you, for
your better under&s;tanding her hi&s;tory, which
I have never yet &s;hewn to any body but my
&s;on.</P>
<P>When I took my leave, &s;he put the ma|nu&s;cript
into my hands, with a charge to be
careful of it</P>
<P>We returned to town, and in le&s;s than
three weeks I had the mortification to hear
that this re&s;pectable old Lady, by whom I
had been entertained with &s;o much friend|&s;hip
and politene&s;s, was dead. Her &s;on
(my friend) was on this occa&s;ion obliged to
go down into Buckingham&s;hire; it was
&s;ome months before I &s;aw him again, as he
had a good deal of family bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ettle.</P>
<P>When he came back to London, I offer|red
to return him the manu&s;cript, which he
had quite forgot. He told me, as he had
<PB N="10" REF="12">
all the original papers, <HI>that</HI> the copy was
at my &s;ervice.</P>
<P>I then expre&s;&s;ed my wi&s;h that it were
made public. To this he at fir&s;t objected,
as he &s;aid there were &s;everal per&s;ons living,
related to the parties concerned in &s;ome of
the principal events of the &s;tory, who might
take umbrage at it. I told him, that this
might ea&s;ily be obviated, by changing the
names both of per&s;ons and places, which I
would undertake to do throughout the
whole; and I was afterwards &s;o urgent with
him to comply with my reque&s;t, that he at
la&s;t yielded. With his con&s;ent therefore I
give it to the world, ju&s;t as I received it,
without any alteration, excepting the pro|po&s;ed
one of a change of names.</P>

<HEAD>MEMOIRS
OF
Mi&s;s SIDNEY BIDULPH.</HEAD>
<P>_MRS. Catherine Sidney Bidulph,
was the Daughter of Sir Robert
Bidulph of Wilt&s;hire. Her fa|ther
died when &s;he was very
young; and of ten children none &s;urvived
him but this lady, and his elde&s;t &s;on, after|wards
Sir George Bidulph. The family
e&s;tate was not very con&s;iderable; and Mi&s;s
Bidulph's portion was but four thou&s;and
pounds; a fortune however at that time
not quite contemptible: it was in the begin|ning
of queen Ann's reign.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="14">
Lady Bidulph was a woman of plain
&s;en&s;e but exemplary piety; the &s;trictne&s;s
of her notions (highly commendable in
them&s;elves) now and then gave a tincture
of &s;everity to her actions, though &s;he was
ever e&s;teemed a truly good woman.</P>
<P>She had educated her daughter, who was
one of the greate&s;t beauties of her time, in
the &s;tricte&s;t principles of virtue; from which
&s;he never deviated, through the cour&s;e of
an innocent, though unhappy life.</P>
<P>Sir George Bidulph was nine or ten years
older than his &s;i&s;ter. He was a man of a
good under&s;tanding, moral as to his gene|ral
conduct, but void of any of tho&s;e refined
&s;entiments, which con&s;titute what is called
<HI>delicacy.</HI> Pride is &s;ometimes accounted lau|dable;
that which Sir George po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed (for
he had pride) was not of this kind.</P>
<P>He was of a weakly con&s;titution, and had
been ordered by the phy&s;icians to Spa for
the recovery of a lingering di&s;order, which
he had laboured under for &s;ome time. It
was ju&s;t on his return to England that the
bu&s;y &s;cene of his &s;i&s;ter's life opened. An
intimate friend of hers, of her own &s;ex, to
whom &s;he revealed all the &s;ecrets of her
heart, happened at this juncture to go a|broad,
and it was for her peru&s;al only the
following journal was intended. That friend
<PB N="13" REF="15">
has carefully pre&s;erved it, as &s;he thinks it
may &s;erve for an example to prove, that
neither prudence, fore&s;ight, nor even the
be&s;t di&s;po&s;ition that the human heart is capa|ble
of, are of them&s;elves &s;ufficient to defend
us again&s;t the inevitable ills that &s;ometimes
are allotted, even to the be&s;t. &lsquo;The race
is not to the &s;wift, nor the battle to the
&s;trong.&rsquo;</P>

<P>MY dear and ever-beloved Cecilia is
now on her way to Harwich. How
in&s;ipid will this ta&s;k of recording all the little
incidents of the day now appear to me, when
you, my &s;i&s;ter, friend of my heart, are no
longer near me? how many tedious months
will it be before I again embrace you? how
many Days of impatience mu&s;t I &s;uffer be|fore
I can even hear from you, or commu|nicate
to you the actions, the words, the
thoughts of your Sidney?&mdash;But let me
not grow plaintive, the &s;tile my friend hates
&mdash;I &s;hould be ungrateful (if I indulged it)
to the be&s;t of mothers, who, to gratify and
amu&s;e me on this fir&s;t occa&s;ion of &s;orrow
<PB N="14" REF="16">
which I ever experienced, has been induced
to quit her beloved retirement, and come on
purpo&s;e to London, to rou&s;e up my &s;pirits,
and, as &s;he expre&s;&s;es her&s;elf, to keep me
from the &s;in of murmuring.</P>
<P>Avaunt then, complainings! Let me re&s;t
a&s;&s;ured that my Cecilia is happy in her pur|&s;uits,
and let me re&s;olve on making my&s;elf
&s;o in mine.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 3. We have had a letter from my
brother George; he is landed, and we ex|pect
him hourly in town. As our hou&s;e is
large enough, I hope he will con&s;ent to take
up his quarters with us while we &s;tay in Lon|don.
My mother intends to reque&s;t it of him:
&s;he &s;ays it will be for the <HI>reputation</HI> of a gay
young man to live in a <HI>&s;ober</HI> family. I know
not how Sir George may reli&s;h the propo&s;al,
as our hours are not likely to corre&s;pond with
tho&s;e which I &s;uppo&s;e he has been u&s;ed to
&s;ince he has been ab&s;ent from us. But per|haps
he may not refu&s;e the compliment; Sir
George is not aver&s;e to oeconomy.&mdash;
How kind, how indulgent, is this worthy
parent of mine! &s;he will not &s;uffer me to &s;tay
at home with her, nay, &s;carce allows me
time for my journal. &startq;Sidney, I won't have
you &s;tay within; I won't have you write;
I won't have you think&mdash;I will make a
<PB N="15" REF="17">
rake of you; you &s;hall go to the play to
night, and I am almo&s;t tempted to go with
you my&s;elf, though I have not been at one
&s;ince your father's death&rsquo;&mdash;The&s;e were
her kind expre&s;&s;ions to me ju&s;t now.&mdash;I am
indeed indebted to her tenderne&s;s, when &s;he
relaxes &s;o much of her u&s;ual &s;trictne&s;s, as
even to <HI>think</HI> of &s;uch a thing.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 5.&mdash;My brother returned to us this
day, thank God! in perfect health. Never
was there &s;uch an alteration &s;een in a man;
he is grown fat, and looks quite robu&s;t. He
dropped in upon us ju&s;t as we &s;at down to
dinner: what a clutter has his arrival made!
my mother was <HI>&s;o</HI> rejoyc'd, and <HI>&s;o</HI> thank|ful,
and <HI>&s;o</HI> full of prai&s;es, and a&s;ked <HI>&s;o</HI> many
que&s;tions, that George could hardly find
words enough to an&s;wer the over-flowings of
her kind inqui&s;itivene&s;s, which la&s;ted all
dinner-time.</P>
<P>When the cloth was removed, my mother
propo&s;ed his taking up his abode with us:
you &s;ee, &s;aid &s;he, your &s;i&s;ter and I have got
here into a large hou&s;e; there is full room
enough in it for you and your &s;ervants; and as
I think in &s;uch a town as this it will be a repu|table
place for you to live in, I &s;hould be
glad of your company; provided you do
not encroach upon my rules by unrea&s;onable
<PB N="16" REF="18">
hours, or receiving vi&s;its from &s;uch as I may
not approve of for the acquaintance of your
&s;i&s;ter. I was afraid Sir George would di&s;|reli&s;h
the terms, as perhaps &s;ome of his ac|quaintance
(though far from faulty ones)
might fall within my mother's predicament:
but I was mi&s;taken, he accepted of the invi|tation,
after making &s;ome &s;light apologies
about the inconvenience of having &s;o many
&s;ervants: this however was &s;oon got over.</P>
<P>To &s;ay the truth, I am very glad that my
brother has con&s;ented to be our gue&s;t, as I
hope by his means our circle of acquaintance
will be a good deal enlarged. There is no
plea&s;ure in &s;ociety, without a proper mixture
of well-bred &s;en&s;ible people of both &s;exes,
and I have hitherto been chiefly confined to
tho&s;e of my own.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked Sir George, joco&s;ely, what he had
brought me home? he an&s;wered, perhaps a
good hu&s;band.&mdash;My mother catched up the
word&mdash;What do you mean, Son? I mean,
madam, that there is come over with me a
gentleman, with whom I became acquainted
in Germany, who of all the men I ever
knew, I &s;hould wi&s;h to have for a brother.
If Sidney &s;hould fortunately be born under
the influence of <HI>uncommonly</HI> good &s;tars, it
may happen to be brought about. I can tell
you (applying him&s;elf to me) he is prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
<PB N="17" REF="19">
in your favour already; I have &s;hewn
him &s;ome of your letters, and he thinks you
a good &s;en&s;ible girl. I told him you were
very well in your per&s;on, and that you have
had an excellent education. I hope &s;o, &s;aid
my mother, looking plea&s;ed; and what
have you to tell us of this wonderful man that
&s;o much &s;urpa&s;&s;es every body? Why, ma|dam,
for <HI>your</HI> part of his character, he is
the be&s;t <HI>behaved</HI> young man I ever &s;aw. I
never knew anybody equal to him for &s;obrie|ty,
nor &s;o intirely free from all the other vices
of youth: as I lived in the &s;ame hou&s;e with
him for &s;ome months, I had frequent op|portunities
of making my ob&s;ervations. I
have known him to <HI>avoid</HI> many irregularities,
but never &s;aw him guilty of <HI>one.</HI></P>
<P>An admirable character, indeed, &s;aid
my mother. So thought I too; but I want|ed
to know a little more of him. Now, Sid|ney,
for your &s;hare in the de&s;cription; I mu&s;t
tell you he is mo&s;t exqui&s;itely hand&s;ome,
and extremely &s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>Good &s;en&s;e to be &s;ure is requi&s;ite, &s;aid my
mother, but as for beauty it is but a fading
flower at be&s;t, and in a man not at all nece&s;|&s;ary&mdash;A
man is not the wor&s;e for it, howe|ever,
cried my brother&mdash;No&mdash;my mother
an&s;wered, provided it does not make him
vain, and too fond of the admiration of giddy
<PB N="18" REF="20">
girls&mdash;That I will be &s;worn is not the ca&s;e of
my friend, an&s;wered Sir George, I believe
no body with &s;uch a per&s;on as his (if there <HI>can</HI>
be &s;uch another) would be &s;o little vain of it;
nay, I have heard him declare, that even in
a woman he would give the preference to
&s;en&s;e and virtue.</P>
<P>Good young man! cried my mother, I
&s;hould like to be acquainted with him (So
&s;hould I, whi&s;pered I to my own heart.)</P>
<P>Well, brother, &s;aid I, you have drawn a
good picture; but to make it complete, you
mu&s;t throw in genero&s;ity, valour, &s;weetne&s;s
of temper, and a great deal of money&mdash;Fie,
my dear (&s;aid my good <HI>literal</HI> parent) a <HI>great
deal</HI> is not nece&s;&s;ary; a very moderate for|tune
with &s;uch a man is &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>The good qualities you require in the fi|ni&s;hing
of my piece, an&s;wered my brother,
he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in an eminent degree&mdash;will that
&s;atisfy you? As for his fortune&mdash;<HI>there</HI> per|haps
a difficulty may &s;tep in&mdash;What e&s;tate,
madam, (to my mother) do you think my
&s;i&s;ter's fortune may entitle her to?</P>
<P>Dear brother, I cried, pray do not &s;peak
in that <HI>bargaining</HI> way.</P>
<P>My mother an&s;wered him very gravely,
your father you know left her but four thou|&s;and
pounds; it is in my power to add a <HI>lit|tle</HI>
to it, if &s;he marries to plea&s;e me. Great
<PB N="19" REF="21">
matters we have no right to expect; but a
<HI>very</HI> good girl, as my daughter is, I think,
de&s;erves &s;omething more than a bare equiva|lent.
The equality, &s;aid my brother, (with
a demure look) I fear is out of all propor|tion
here, for the gentleman I &s;pake of has
but&mdash;&s;ix thou&s;and pounds a year.</P>
<P>He bur&s;t out a laughing; it was not good-natured,
and I was vexed at his joke. My
poor mother dropped her countenance; I
looked &s;illy, as if I had been di&s;appointed,
but I &s;aid nothing.</P>
<P>Then he is above our reach, Sidney, an|&s;wered
my mother.</P>
<P>I made no reply&mdash;Have a good heart, Sid,
cried my brother; if my nonpareil likes you,
when he &s;ees you, (I felt my&s;elf hurt, and
grow red) and without a compliment, &s;i&s;ter,
(&s;eeing me look mortified) I think he will,
fortune will be no objection. I have already
told him the utmo&s;t extent of your expecta|tions;
he would hardly let me mention the
&s;ubject; he has a mind for my &s;i&s;ter, and if he
finds her per&s;onal accompli&s;hments an&s;wer a
brother's (perhaps partial) de&s;cription, it will
be your own fault, if you have not the pret|tie&s;t
fellow in England for your hu&s;band.</P>
<P>My mother rea&s;&s;umed her plea&s;ed coun|tenance.
Where is he? let us &s;ee him? I
forced a &s;mile, though I did not feel my&s;elf
<PB N="20" REF="22">
quite &s;atisfied&mdash;We parted on the road, my
brother an&s;wered; he is gone to Bath for a
few weeks; he has &s;ent his &s;ervants and his
baggage to town before him, and has com|mi&s;&s;ioned
me to take a hou&s;e for him in St.
James's Square, or &s;ome of the adjacent
&s;treets; &s;o that we &s;hall have him in our
neighbourhood.</P>
<P>My mother enquired on what account he
went to Bath. Sir George &s;aid he complained
of a weakne&s;s in one of his wri&s;ts, which was
the con&s;equence of a fever that had &s;eized
him on his journey, in their return to Eng|land.
It &s;eems he had fini&s;hed his travels,
on which he had been ab&s;ent near five years,
when my brother and he met in Germany.
The liking he took to Sir George protracted
his &s;tay, and he re&s;olved not to quit him
while his health obliged him to continue
abroad; they took a trip to Paris together,
and returned home by Holland.</P>
<P>The name of this piece of perfection is
Faulkland, Orlando Faulkland. What a
pretty name Orlando is! My mother &s;ays it
is romantic, and wonders how <HI>&s;ober</HI> people
can give their children &s;uch names.</P>
<P>Now am I dying with curio&s;ity to &s;ee this
man. A few weeks at Bath&mdash;what bu&s;i|ne&s;s
had he to go to Bath till he had fir&s;t &s;et|tled
his hou&s;hold at London? His wri&s;t
<PB N="21" REF="23">
might have grown well without the pump.
I am afraid he is gone to Bath only to &s;hew
him&s;elf, and that he will be &s;napped up be|fore
he comes to town. I wi&s;h Sir George
had kept the account of him to him&s;elf, till
he returned to London again.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 7.&mdash;We have &s;ettled Sir George's
oeconomy within doors: my mother has
been very bu&s;y all day in fixing trunks,
portmanteaus, and boxes, in their proper
places; and in appropriating the rooms for
his men, which &s;he has taken care &s;hall be
as remote from tho&s;e of our &s;ervants as the
hou&s;e will admit. She &s;ays, &s;he knows our
own dome&s;tics to be orderly and regular,
but &s;he cannot an&s;wer what other people's
may be.</P>
<P>I begin to recover my &s;pirits: my bro|ther's
arrival has given new life to the family;
my mother thinks that in <HI>his</HI> company, with
a lady or two, there will be no impropriety
in &s;uffering me to go, at lea&s;t, half a dozen
times into public during the &s;ea&s;on, even
without the &s;anction of her pre&s;ence&mdash;
How kind, how con&s;iderate is this dear mo|ther!
I find this was one (among&s;t others) of
her principal rea&s;ons for wi&s;hing Sir George
to be with us, as it will &s;ave her from the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of going to public diver&s;ions, which
otherwi&s;e &s;he would have done, rather than
<PB N="22" REF="24">
have me debarred the plea&s;ure of partaking
of them, through the want of a proper pro|tector.
Every day lays me under fre&s;h obli|gations
to her.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 20.&mdash;My brother has had ano|ther
letter from Mr. Faulkland. He has
been but a fortnight at Bath, and already has
found benefit from the u&s;e of the pump; I
wi&s;h his wri&s;t was quite well; I never was &s;o
impatient to &s;ee any body&mdash;But, Sidney,
have a care&mdash;this heart has never yet been
touched: this man is repre&s;ented as a dan|gerous
object. What an ill-fated girl &s;hould
I be, if I &s;hould fall in love with him, and
he &s;hould happen not to like me? Should
<HI>happen,</HI> what a vain expre&s;&s;ion was that! I
would not for the world any one &s;hould &s;ee
it but my Cecilia.&mdash;Well, if he &s;hould not
like me, what then? why, I will not like
him. If I have a heart, not very &s;u&s;cepti|ble
of what we young women call love; and
in all likelihood I &s;hall be as indifferent to
him, as he may be to me&mdash;Indeed I think I
ought to re&s;olve on not liking him; for not|with&s;tanding
tho&s;e fine out-lines of a charac|ter,
which my brother gave me of him in
the pre&s;ence of my mother, I have &s;ince drawn
out of Sir George, who is always talking of
him, &s;ome farther particulars which do not
<PB N="23" REF="25">
plea&s;e me &s;o well; for I think he is made up
of contrarieties.</P>
<P>Nature, &s;ays Sir George, never formed a
temper &s;o gentle, &s;o humane, &s;o benevolent
as his; yet, when provoked, no tempe&s;t is
more furious. You would imagine him &s;o
humble, that he thinks every one &s;uperior to
him&s;elf; yet through this di&s;gui&s;e have I di&s;|covered,
at certain times, a pride which
makes him look down on all mankind.
With a di&s;po&s;ition formed to reli&s;h, and a
heart attached to the dome&s;tic plea&s;ures of
life, he is of &s;o enterprizing a temper, that
dangers and difficulties rather encourage than
di&s;hearten him, in the pur&s;uit of a favourite
point. His ideas of love, honour, gene|ro&s;ity,
and gratitude, are &s;o refined, that no
hero in romance ever went beyond him; of
this I was convinced from many little inci|dents
which occurred in the cour&s;e of my
acquaintance with him The mode&s;ty and
affability of his deportment makes every
body fancy, when he is in company with
them, that he is delighted with their conver|&s;ation;
nay, he often affects to be improved
and informed; yet there is a &s;ly turn to ri|dicule
in him, which, though without the
lea&s;t tincture of ill-nature, makes him &s;ee
and repre&s;ent things in a light, the very op|po&s;ite
of that in which you fancied he &s;aw
<PB N="24" REF="26">
them. With the nice&s;t di&s;cernment, where
he permits his judgment alone to determine,
let pa&s;&s;ion interfere, and a child can impo&s;e
on him. Though, as I have already told you,
he is very hand&s;ome, he affects to de&s;pi&s;e
beauty in his own &s;ex; yet is it ea&s;y to per|ceive,
by the nice care he takes in his dre&s;s
(though the farthe&s;t in the world from a fop,)
that he does not altogether di&s;regard it in his
own per&s;on.</P>
<P>Are not the&s;e faults? yes, &s;urely they are;
yet Sir George prote&s;ts he has none; or at
lea&s;t &s;ays, if the&s;e be &s;uch, they are &s;o over-ballanced
by his good qualities, that unle&s;s it
be <HI>you,</HI> &s;i&s;ter (flattering creature! though that
is &s;eldom his failing) I don't know the wo|man
that de&s;erves him. I did not thank
him for the compliment he paid me, at the
expence of the re&s;t of our poor &s;ex.</P>
<P><HI>May 5.</HI>&mdash;A month is pa&s;t &s;ince my bro|ther
arrived, and Mr. Faulkland does not yet
talk of coming to town&mdash;If Sir George had
drawn half &s;uch a flattering picture of me
to him, as he has done of him to me, his
curio&s;ity would have brought him here &s;oon|er.&mdash;
My mother has mentioned him &s;everal
times, and a&s;ked when he is to be in town?
My brother has taken a very hand&s;ome hou&s;e
for him in the Square. We are all in expec|tation
of this blazing &s;tar's making its ap|pearance
<PB N="25" REF="27">
in London. If he &s;tays much
longer, my patience will be &s;o tired, that I
will not give a pinch of &s;nuff to &s;ee him.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 19.&mdash;Six weeks, and no news of Mr.
Faulkland's coming! I'll po&s;itively give
him but another week; I begin to think
my&s;elf affronted at his &s;tay.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 23.&mdash;Now, now, my Cecilia, I
can gratify your curio&s;ity at full: he is come
at la&s;t; Mr. Faulkland, I mean; Orlando is
come! we had a me&s;&s;age from him this
morning, to enquire after all our healths; he
was ju&s;t arrived at his hou&s;e in the Square:
Sir George flew to him directly, and &s;aid he
would bring him without ceremony to take
a family dinner. My mother bid him do &s;o;
and &s;he held a quarter of an hour's confer|ence
with her cook. She is always elegant
and exact at her table; but we were more
than ordinarily &s;o to-day. My brother
brought Mr. Faulkland a little before din|ner-time,
and pre&s;ented him to my mother
and me, with that kind of freedom that al|mo&s;t
looked as if he were already one of the
family.</P>
<P>We had both been prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed highly in
favour of his figure, a circum&s;tance that &s;el|dom
is of advantage to per&s;ons on their fir&s;t
appearance: but here it had not that effect:
Sir George did not over rate the per&s;onal ac|compli&s;hments
<PB N="26" REF="28">
of his friend. Now you'll
expect I &s;hould de&s;cribe him to you, per|haps,
and paint this romantic hero in the
glowing colours of romantic exaggeration.
But I'll di&s;appoint you&mdash;and tell you, that
he is neither like an Adonis nor an Apollo
&mdash;that he has no hyacinthine curls flowing
down his back; no eyes like &s;uns, who&s;e
brightne&s;s and maje&s;ty &s;trike the beholders
dumb; nor, in &s;hort, no rays of divinity
about him; yet he is the hand&s;ome&s;t mortal
man that I ever &s;aw.&mdash;I will not &s;ay that
his voice is harmony it&s;elf, and that all the
loves and graces (for why &s;hould not there
be male as well as female graces?) attend on
his motions; that Minerva pre&s;ides over his
lips, and every feature has its attendant Cu|pid&mdash;
But I will acknowledge that his voice
in &s;peaking is inexpre&s;&s;ibly plea&s;ing (you
know how I admire an agreeable voice;) that
his air and motions are ea&s;y, genteel, and
graceful; his conver&s;ation &s;en&s;ible and polite,
and without the lea&s;t tincture of affectation,
that thing, which of all others, would to
<HI>me</HI> de&s;troy the charms of an angel.&mdash;In
&s;hort, without hyperbole, that he is, what
every one mu&s;t allow, a perfectly hand&s;ome
and accompli&s;hed young man.</P>
<P>I never &s;aw my mother appear &s;o plea&s;ed
with any one. The polite freedom of his
addre&s;s, the attention and deference he
<PB N="27" REF="29">
&s;eemed to pay to her &s;entiments (and the dear
good woman talked more to him, I think,
than ever I heard her do to any one on &s;o
&s;hort an acquaintance,) delighted her beyond
expre&s;&s;ion. I bore no great part in the con|ver&s;ation,
but was not, however, quite over-looked
by Mr. Faulkland. He referred to
me in di&s;cour&s;e now and then, and &s;eemed
plea&s;ed with me; at lea&s;t I fancied &s;o. My
brother endeavoured to draw me out, as he
&s;aid afterwards. The intention was kind,
but poor Sir George is not delicate enough
in tho&s;e matters; I &s;hould have done better
if he had let me alone. I thought of the
conver&s;ations we have &s;o often had about Mr.
Faulkland, and could not help con&s;idering
my&s;elf like a piece of goods that was to be
&s;hewn to the be&s;t advantage to the purcha&s;er.
This reflection threw a &s;ort of con&s;traint
over my behaviour, that (fool as I was) I
had not courage enough to &s;hake off, and I
did not acquit my&s;elf at all to my own mind.
I had, notwith&s;tanding, the good fortune to
plea&s;e my mother infinitely. She told me,
after our vi&s;itor was gone, that my behavi|our
had been <HI>&s;trictly</HI> proper; and blamed
Sir George for his wanting to engage me too
often in conver&s;ation. You may a&s;&s;ure your|&s;elf,
&s;on, &s;he &s;aid, that a man of Mr. Faulk|land's
under&s;tanding will not like a young
lady the wor&s;e for her &s;ilence. She &s;poke
<PB N="28" REF="30">
enough to &s;hew that it was not for want of
knowing what to &s;ay that &s;he held her tongue.
The man who does not reckon a mode&s;t re|&s;erve
among&s;t the chief recommendations of
a woman, &s;hould be no hu&s;band for Sidney.
I am &s;ure, when I married Sir Robert, he
had never heard me &s;peak twenty &s;entences.
Sir George agreed with her as to the propri|ety
of her ob&s;ervation, in regard to a mode&s;t
re&s;erve; but &s;aid, people now-a-days did
not carry their ideas of it quite &s;o far as they
did when his father's court&s;hip began with
her; and added that a young lady might
<HI>&s;peak</HI> with as much mode&s;ty as &s;he could hold
her tongue.</P>
<P>I did not interfere in the debate, only
&s;aid, I was very glad to have my mother's
approbation of my conduct. This put an
end to the argument, and my mother launch|ed
out into high encomiums on Mr. Faulk|land.
She &s;aid, upon her <HI>truth,</HI> he was the
fine&s;t young man &s;he ever &s;aw, in every re|&s;pect.
So mode&s;t, &s;o well bred, &s;o very en|tertaining,
and &s;o una&s;&s;uming, with all his
fine accompli&s;hments: She was quite a&s;to|ni&s;hed;
and owned &s;he had almo&s;t de&s;paired
of finding a young gentleman, of the pre|&s;ent
mode of education, &s;o <HI>very</HI> unexcepti|onable
in his behaviour. If his morals an|&s;wered
to his outward deportment&mdash;
there &s;he &s;topped; or rather Sir George in|terrupted
<PB N="29" REF="31">
her. I hope you'll believe, ma|dam,
that my knowledge of mankind is not
&s;o circum&s;cribed, but that I can di&s;tingui&s;h
between a real and an a&s;&s;umed character;
and I will venture to a&s;&s;ert, that, in the circle
of my acquaintance, I do not know <HI>one</HI> &s;o
unobjectionable, even in your &s;trict &s;en&s;e of
the word <HI>morals,</HI> as Mr. Faulkland.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid my mother, I have the plea&s;ure
to ob&s;erve to you (and I think I am &s;eldom
mi&s;taken in my judgment,) that Mr. Faulk|land
is at lea&s;t as well plea&s;ed with Sidney as
we are with him&mdash;What &s;ay you? daughter,
Ay, what <HI>&s;ay</HI> you, &s;i&s;ter? cried Sir George
&mdash;I think, madam, that Mr. Faulkland
is an accompli&s;hed gentleman, and&mdash;&startq;and
that you could be content to look no far|ther,
if matters are brought to bear; eh,
Sidney?&endq; (I need not tell you who&s;e &s;peech
this was)&mdash;Brother, that is going a little
too far, for the fir&s;t time of my &s;eeing him.
A great <HI>deal</HI> too far, my mother &s;aid; let
us fir&s;t know Mr. Faulkland's mind from
him&s;elf, before we &s;ay a word more of the
matter.</P>
<P>Sir George told us, that Mr. Faulkland,
at going away, had reque&s;ted he would &s;up
with him at his own hou&s;e, as he &s;aid he had
a few vi&s;its of form to pay, and &s;hould be at
home early in the evening.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="32">
<HI>May</HI> 24.&mdash;My mother and I were in
bed before my brother came in la&s;t night,
though he keeps very good hours in general.
When we met this morning at breakfa&s;t, I
&s;aw by Sir George's face that he was brim|ful
of &s;omething&mdash;Faulkland don't like you,
Sidney, &s;aid he, abruptly&mdash;How can you
or I help that, brother? cry'd I, colouring;
tho', to tell you the truth, I did not believe
him; for I knew, if it <HI>had</HI> been &s;o, he
would not have come out with it &s;o bluntly.
But my mother, who always takes every
word &s;he hears literally, took him up very
&s;hort; &startq;If he does not, Sir, it is not polite
in you to tell your &s;i&s;ter &s;o; I hope Sidney
may be <HI>liked</HI> by as good a man as Mr.
Faulkland,&endq; and up &s;he to&s;&s;ed her dear
hone&s;t head. Sir George bur&s;t out a laugh|ing.
My mother looked angry; &s;he was
afraid her &s;agacity would be called in que&s;ti|on,
after what &s;he had pronounced the even|ing
before. I looked &s;illy, but pretended to
&s;mile. Sir George was clown enough to
laugh on; at la&s;t (to my mother) &startq;But,
my dear madam, can you believe me &s;e|rious
in what I have &s;aid? have you &s;o
good an opinion of my veracity, or &s;o ill a
one of my breeding, as to &s;uppo&s;e I would
&s;hock my &s;i&s;ter by &s;o rude a declaration, if
I meant any thing by it but a joke?&endq; In|deed,
<PB N="31" REF="33">
Sidney, (looking half &s;miling at me)
I would not be as much in love with our &s;o|vereign
lady the queen, as poor Faulkland
is with you, for my whole e&s;tate.</P>
<P>This put me a great deal more out of
countenance than what he had &s;aid at fir&s;t.
Nay, brother, now you are too extravagant
the other way&mdash;My mother looked &s;ur|prized,
but recovered her good humour pre|&s;ently&mdash;Dear
George, there is no know|ing
when you are in earne&s;t, and when not:
but, as Sidney &s;ays, now you are rather too
extravagant. You might &s;ay &s;o to Faulk|land,
an&s;wered my brother, if you were to
hear him; I could get nothing from him the
whole night but your prai&s;es. I thought,
&s;aid my plea&s;ed mother, he had not <HI>di&s;liked</HI>
the girl&mdash;Now you &s;ee, &s;on, her <HI>&s;ilence</HI>
did her no harm; and &s;he &s;miled tenderly at
me. Come, &s;aid Sir George, things are
mighty well on both &s;ides. Faulkland has
begged of me, that I would u&s;e my intere&s;t
with your mother, (whom he thinks one of
the be&s;t of women,) that he may be permitted
to form to make his addre&s;&s;es to Mi&s;s Bi|dulph.
<HI>My</HI> intere&s;t he knows he has, and I
hope, madam, it will have your approbati|on&mdash;He
de&s;ired me to explain minutely every
circum&s;tance of his fortune: what his e&s;tate
is, I have told you; and his family is of
<PB N="32" REF="34">
known di&s;tinction. He begged I would not
<HI>mention</HI> Sidney's fortune; and &s;aid, that if,
upon farther acquaintance, he &s;hould have
the happine&s;s to be acceptable to my &s;i&s;ter,
he &s;hould in&s;i&s;t upon leaving the appointment
of her &s;ettlement to lady Bidulph and my&s;elf.
I told him I would lay this propo&s;al before
you, and could for his pre&s;ent comfort in|form
him, that, as I believed my &s;i&s;ter had
no prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in favour of any one el&s;e, I
was &s;ure that if he met with your concur|rence,
her's would follow of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>A very di&s;creet an&s;wer, &s;aid my mother;
ju&s;t &s;uch a one as I would have dictated to
you, if I had been at your elbow. I believe we
may venture to &s;uppo&s;e, that Mrs. Sidney
<HI>has</HI> no prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and as this is as hand|&s;ome
an offer as can po&s;&s;ibly be made, I have
no objections (if you have none, my dear)
to admit Mr. Faulkland upon the terms he
propo&s;es.</P>
<P>What an&s;wer ought I to have made, Ceci|lia?
Why, to be &s;ure, ju&s;t the one I <HI>did</HI> make
&mdash;I have no prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, madam, looking
down and blu&s;hing, till it had actually paint|ed
me, for I was really &s;tartled. My Cecilia
knows I am not a prude.</P>
<P>My dear! cry'd my mother, and took
me by the hand&mdash;</P>
<P>Poor Sidney, &s;aid Sir George, how you
are to be pitied! Mr. Faulkland purpo&s;es
<PB N="33" REF="35">
waiting on you in the afternoon, if he is not
<HI>forbid;</HI> and he looked &s;o teazingly &s;ly, that
my mother bid him leave off his <HI>pranks.</HI></P>
<P>The day is over&mdash;Mr. Faulkland &s;pent
the evening with us; no other company but
our own family. My mother likes him bet|ter
even than before&mdash;Thy <HI>mother</HI>&mdash;di&s;ingenuous
girl! why do&s;t thou not &s;peak
thy <HI>own</HI> &s;entiments! (There is an apo&s;trophe
for thy u&s;e, my Cecilia.) Well then, <HI>my</HI>
&s;entiments you &s;hall have; you have an un|doubted
right to know them on all &s;ubjects,
but particularly on this intere&s;ting one.</P>
<P>I <HI>do</HI> think Mr. Faulkland the mo&s;t amia|ble
of men; and if my heart were (happily
for me it is not) <HI>very</HI> &s;u&s;ceptible of tender
impre&s;&s;ions, I really believe I &s;hould in time
be ab&s;olutely in love with him. This con|fe&s;&s;ion
will not &s;atisfy you: may be it is not
enough&mdash;yet, in truth, Cecilia, it is all that
at pre&s;ent I can afford you.</P>
<P>The thoughts of the aukward figure I
&s;hould make in the evening vi&s;it, &s;at heavy
on my &s;pirits all day.&mdash;Can you conceive
any thing more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing than the &s;ituation
of a poor girl, receiving the vi&s;it of a man,
who for the fir&s;t time, comes profe&s;&s;edly as
her admirer? I had conceived a frightful idea
of &s;uch an interview, having formed my
notions of it only from romances, where &s;et
&s;peeches of an ell long are made by the
<PB N="34" REF="36">
lover, and an&s;wers of a proportionable &s;ize
are returned in form by the lady. But Mr.
Faulkland &s;oon delivered me from my anxi|ety.
His ea&s;y, but incomparably polite and
&s;en&s;ible freedom of addre&s;s, quickly made
me lo&s;e my ridiculous fears.&mdash;He made no
other u&s;e of his vi&s;it, than to recommend
him&s;elf more &s;trongly to our e&s;teem, by &s;uch
means as proved how well he de&s;erved it.
If he was particular to me either in his looks
or manner, it was under the regulation of
&s;uch a nice decorum, that I (who &s;uppo&s;ed
I mu&s;t have &s;unk with downright confu&s;ion)
was hardly di&s;concerted during the whole
vi&s;it.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 10.&mdash;I do really think my good
mother grows &s;o fond of Mr. Faulkland,
that if he goes on at this rate, he will get the
&s;tart even of Sir George in her affections&mdash;
&startq;Mr. Faulkland &s;aid &s;o and &s;o; Mr. <HI>Faulk|land</HI>
is of opinion; and I am &s;ure you will
allow Mr. <HI>Faulkland</HI> to be a good judge of
&s;uch and &s;uch things.&endq;</P>
<P>To &s;ay the truth, the man improves upon
you every hour you know him. And yet I
have di&s;covered in him &s;ome of tho&s;e little
(and they are <HI>but</HI> little) alloys to his many
good qualities, which Sir George told me
of. The intere&s;t I may one day have in him
makes me a clo&s;er ob&s;erver than I &s;hould o|therwi&s;e
be. There <HI>is</HI> that &s;ly turn to ridi|cule
<PB N="35" REF="37">
which my brother mentioned; yet to
do him ju&s;tice, he never employs it, but
where it is de&s;erved; and then too with &s;o
much vivacity and good humour, that one
cannot be angry wiih him.</P>
<P>We had a good deal of company at din|ner
with us to day; among&s;t the re&s;t, young
Sayers, who is returned from his travels, as
<HI>he</HI> calls it. You remember he went away
a good humoured, inoffen&s;ive, quiet fool;
he has brought no one ingredient of that
character back with him but the la&s;t; for
&s;uch a &s;tiff, conceited, overbearing, talka|tive,
impertinent coxcomb, does not exi&s;t.
His mother, who, poor woman, you know
originally made a &s;impleton of the boy, con|tributes
now all in her power to fini&s;h the
fop; and &s;he carries him about with her
every where for a &s;how. We were a&s;&s;em|bled
in the drawing-room before dinner: in
<HI>bur&s;t</HI> (for it was not a common entry) Ma&s;|ter
Sayers, and his mama, the cub handing
in the old lady&mdash;<HI>So</HI> &s;tiff, and <HI>&s;o</HI> aukward,
and <HI>&s;o</HI> ungrateful, and &s;o <HI>very</HI> unlike Mr.
Faulkland, that I pitied the poor thing,
who thought that every body would admire
him as much as his mother did. After he
had been pre&s;ented to the ladies (for it was
the fir&s;t time we had &s;een him &s;ince he came
home), he took a turn or two about the
room, to exhibit his per&s;on: then applying
<PB N="36" REF="38">
him&s;elf to a picture which hung over the
door (a fine land&s;cape of Claude Lorrain,
which Mr. Faulkland him&s;elf had brought
over and given to Sir George), he a&s;ked
my brother, in a tone &s;carce articulate, whe|ther
we had any <HI>painters</HI> in England? My
mother, who by chance heard him, and by
greater chance under&s;tood him, an&s;wered,
before Sir George had time, <HI>Painters,</HI> Sir!
yes, &s;ure, and &s;ome very good ones too;
why, you cannot have forgot <HI>that;</HI> it is not
much above a year &s;ince you went abroad,
(for you mu&s;t know he had been recalled
upon the death of an uncle, who had left
him his e&s;tate). I ob&s;erved Mr. Faulkland
con&s;trained a very &s;ly laugh, on account
both of the <HI>manner</HI> of my mother's taking
his que&s;tion, and her innocently-unde&s;igned
reprimand. Sayers pretended not to hear
her, but looking through his fingers, as if
to throw the picture into per&s;pective, that
is a pretty good piece, &s;aid &s;he, for a copy.
Oh! cry'd his mother, there is no plea&s;ing
<HI>you</HI>&mdash;people who have been <HI>abroad</HI> are &s;uch
connoi&s;&s;eurs in painting&mdash;No body making
an immediate an&s;wer, Mr. Faulkland &s;tep|ped
up to Mr. Sayers, and with &s;uch a ro|gui&s;h
humility in his countenance, that you
would have &s;worn he was a very ignoramus,
aid, &startq;Are you of opinion, Sir that that
picture is nothing but a copy?&endq; Nothing
<PB N="37" REF="39">
more, take my word for it, Sir: When <HI>I</HI>
was at Rome, there was a Dutchman there
who made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to take copies <HI>of</HI>
copies, which he di&s;per&s;ed, and had peo|ple
to &s;ell for him in different parts, at pret|ty
good prices; and they did mighty well;
for very few people <HI>know</HI> a picture; and
I'll an&s;wer for it there are not many ma&s;ters
of eminence, but what have a hundred ori|ginals
palmed upon them, more than ever
they painted in their lives.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland then proceeded to a&s;k him
abundance of que&s;tions, which any one,
who did not know him well, would have
thought he propo&s;ed for no other end but a
de&s;ire of information; and the poor cox|comb
Sayers plumed him&s;elf upon di&s;play|ing
&s;o much travelled knowledge, to a won|dering
ignorant Engli&s;hman, who had never
been out of his own country. The com|pany
were divided into little chattering par|ties,
as is u&s;ual when people are whiling a|way
half an hour before dinner. Mrs.
Sayers, my mother, and I, were &s;itting to|gether
on a couch, near enough to hear the
conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed between the two
gentlemen; at lea&s;t as much as was not &s;unk
in the affected, half-pronounced &s;entences
of Mr. Sayers. His mother, to whom he
was the principal object of attention in the
company, &s;eemed mightily plea&s;ed at the
<PB N="38" REF="40">
opportunity her &s;on had, from the inqui&s;i|tivene&s;s
of Mr. Faulkland (whom &s;he did
not know) of &s;hewing his ta&s;te in the po|lite
arts, and often looked about to ob&s;erve
if any body el&s;e attended to them, My
dear literal woman! (as I often call her to
you) took every thing &s;eriou&s;ly, and whi&s;|pered
to me, how pretty that is, Sidney!
how conde&s;cending in Mr. Faulkland! you
&s;ee he does not make a parade of his <HI>own</HI>
knowledge in the&s;e matters, but is plea&s;ed
to reap the benefit of other people's. I,
who &s;aw the latent roguery, could hardly
contain my&s;elf. Indeed I was amazed at
Mr. Faulkland's grave inqui&s;itive face, and
was very glad my mother did not find him
out.</P>
<P>Sayers, elated with having &s;hone &s;o con|&s;picuou&s;ly
(for he ob&s;erved that both my
mother and I attended to his di&s;cour&s;e) pro|ceeded
to &s;hew away with an immen&s;ity of
vanity and frothy chat, beginning every new
piece of hi&s;tory with, &startq;When <HI>I</HI> was at
Rome, or when <HI>I</HI> was Paris&endq;&mdash;at la&s;t,
unluckily for him, &s;peaking of an incident
(which made a good deal of noi&s;e, and hap|pened
at the fir&s;t mentioned place) in which
two Engli&s;h gentlemen had been concerned,
he &s;aid it was about eleven months ago, ju&s;t
before he left Rome. My mother, who
had heard Mr. Faulkland relate the &s;ame
<PB N="39" REF="41">
&s;tory, but with &s;ome very different circum|&s;tances,
immediately &s;aid, Mr. Faulkland,
have I not heard you &s;peak of that? you
were at Rome your&s;elf when the affair hap|pened;
and if I be not mi&s;taken, it was
through your intere&s;t with the cardinal of
&mdash;that the bu&s;ine&s;s was made up.</P>
<P>If a &s;pectre had appeared to poor Sayers,
he could not have looked more agha&s;t.
He dropped his vi&s;age half-way down his
brea&s;t, and for the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> time &s;peaking very
<HI>plain,</HI> and very loud too, with a &s;tare of
a&s;toni&s;hment, Have <HI>you</HI> been at <HI>Rome,</HI> Sir?
I was there for a little time, Sir, an&s;wered
Mr. Faulkland, with real mode&s;ty; for he
pitied the mortified buzzard; and I know
the &s;tory was <HI>repre&s;ented</HI> as you have told it;
the circum&s;tances differed in a few particu|lars,
but the facts were nearly as you have
related them.</P>
<P>How obligingly did he reconcile the out-of-countenance
Sayers to him&s;elf and to the
compan$? Were you long abroad, pray
Sir, &s;aid the coxcomb? About five years,
Sir, an&s;wered Mr. Faulkland; but I per|ceive,
by the conver&s;ation I have had the
honour of holding with you to-day, that
many accurate and curious ob&s;ervations e|&s;caped
me, which you made in a much &s;hort|er
&s;pace of time; for the communication of
which I think my&s;elf extremely obliged to
<PB N="40" REF="42">
you. Whether the poor &s;oul thought him
&s;erious (as my mother did) I cannot tell;
he made him a bow, however, for the
compliment; but was &s;o lowered, that he
did not &s;ay a word more of Rome or Paris
for the re&s;t of the day: and in this we had
a double advantage; for as we had nothing
el&s;e to talk of, his mouth was effectually
&s;topped, except when Mr. Faulkland, out
of compa&s;&s;ion, a&s;ked him (as he often did)
&s;uch que&s;tions as he thought he could an|&s;wer,
without expo&s;ing his ignorance: for
he was contented to have enjoyed it in their
t&ecirc;te &agrave; t&ecirc;te, and was far from wi&s;hing the
company to be witne&s;&s;es of it.</P>
<P>I think &s;uch a bagatelle may give you
&s;ome idea of this man's turn. I told it to
Sir George; he laughed heartily, and &s;aid
it was <HI>&s;o</HI> like him! My mother loves even
his faults, though &s;he will not allow me to
call them by that name.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 4.&mdash;You are unkind, Cecilia, and
do not do ju&s;tice to my &s;incerity, when you
&s;ay, <HI>you are &s;ure I am in love with Mr. Faulk|land.</HI>
If I were, can you conceive it po&s;|&s;ible
that I would deny it to you? Ah! my
&s;i&s;ter, mu&s;t I &s;u&s;pect <HI>you</HI> of wanting can|dour
by your making a charge of di&s;inge|nuity
again&s;t your friend? Indeed, Cecilia,
if I <HI>am</HI> in love with him, I do not <HI>yet</HI> know
it my&s;elf. I will repeat it to you, I think
<PB N="41" REF="43">
him the mo&s;t amiable of men, and &s;hould
certainly give him the preference, if I were
left to a free choice, over all the re&s;t of his
&s;ex; at lea&s;t all that I have ever yet &s;een;
though po&s;&s;ibly there <HI>may</HI> be hand&s;omer,
wi&s;er, better men, but they have not fallen
within my ob&s;ervation. I am not however
&s;o prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in his favour, as to &s;uppo&s;e
him a phoenix; and if any unfore&s;een event
were to prevent my being his, I am &s;ure
I &s;hould bear it, and behave very hand|&s;omely.</P>
<P>And yet perhaps this may be only bragg|ing
like a coward, becau&s;e I think a very
&s;hort time will put it out of the power of
fortune to divide us. Yet certain as the e|vent
of our marriage appears to me at pre|&s;ent,
I &s;till endeavour to keep a &s;ort of
guard over my wi&s;hes, and will not give
my heart leave to center <HI>all</HI> its happine&s;s in
him; and therefore I cannot rank my&s;elf
among&s;t the fir&s;t-rate lovers, who have,
neither eyes, nor ears, nor &s;en&s;ations
but for one object. <HI>This,</HI> Mr. Faulkland
&s;ays, is his ca&s;e, in regard to me. But I think
we women &s;hould not love at &s;uch a rate,
till <HI>duty</HI> makes the pa&s;&s;ion a virtue; and till
<HI>that</HI> becomes my ca&s;e, I am &s;o much a phi|lo&s;opher
in love, that I am determined not
to let it ab&s;orb any of the other cordial
<PB N="42" REF="44">
affections, which I owe to my relations and
my friends.</P>
<P>I think we ought always to form &s;ome
laws to our&s;elves for the regulation of our
conduct: without this what an impertinent
dream mu&s;t the life be of almo&s;t every young
per&s;on of our &s;ex? You, my dear, though with
an uncommon under&s;tanding of your own,
have always been entirely conducted by
your wi&s;e-parents; and in this I make it my
boa&s;t to have followed your example. I
have been accu&s;tomed from my infancy to
pay an implicit obedience to the be&s;t of
mothers; the conforming to this never yet
co&s;t me an unea&s;y minute, and I am &s;ure ne|ver
will.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 5.&mdash;A little incident happened to|day,
which plea&s;ed my mother wonderfully.
She had been at morning prayers (as you
know is her daily cu&s;tom); when returning
home in her chair, one of the men happen|ed
to &s;lip his foot, and fell down ju&s;t before
Mr. Faulkland's hou&s;e. He was &s;o much
hurt, that he could go no farther; and the
footman immediately opening the chair, told
her &s;he had better &s;tep into Mr. Faulk|land's,
till he called another, or got a man
to a&s;&s;i&s;t in carrying her home.&endq; One of Mr.
Faulkland's &s;ervants happened to be &s;tanding
at the door; &s;o that, without any previous
notice, &s;he was immediately conducted into
<PB N="43" REF="45">
a parlour, where Mr. Faulkland was &s;itting
at breakfa&s;t. She found with him two pret|ty
little children at his knee, to one of whom
he had given &s;ome cake; and the elder of
the two, a boy of about five years old, he
was gravely lecturing, though with great
gentlene&s;s, for having told a lye. My mo|ther
a&s;ked him, with &s;ome &s;urprize, who&s;e
children tho&s;e were? He &s;miled, and told
her they were his coachman's; and then or|dered
the footman to carry them down, bid|ding
the little boy be &s;ure to remember what
he had &s;aid to him.</P>
<P>My mother enquired, if he permitted
them to be in the hou&s;e? He &s;aid, he did;
and had been induced to do it from the di&s;|tre&s;s
he had &s;een their poor father in, a few
days before. He is an hone&s;t careful fel|low,
continued Mr. Faulkland, and has
lived in my family from a boy. He was
married to a good &s;ort of a body, who took
great care of the&s;e children, and helped to
maintain them decently by her work. The
poor woman died in childbed la&s;t week;
and the per&s;on who attended her in her Ill|ne&s;s
(for &s;he had no &s;ervant) took that op|portunity
of robbing the lodgings; and af|ter
plundering the poor creature of every
thing that was worth carrying away, locked
up tho&s;e two children, whom you &s;aw with
<PB N="44" REF="46">
me, and the new-born infant, with the
corp&s;e of their mother.</P>
<P>The poor little wretches continued in that
di&s;mal &s;ituation all night, having cried them|&s;elves
to &s;leep, without being heard, though
there were &s;ome other people in the hou&s;e.
The morning following I happened to make
an early vi&s;it in the neighbourhood of this
di&s;tre&s;&s;ed little family, and my coachman,
who was a very affectionate hu&s;band and
father, took that opportunity of calling on
his wife, whom he had not been able to &s;ee
for three days. The cries of his children
(now awake and almo&s;t &s;tarved) obliged
him ha&s;tily to break open the room door,
where the poor fellow was &s;hocked with the
di&s;mal &s;pectacle of his wife lying breathle&s;s
in her bed, the infant almo&s;t expiring at
her &s;ide, and the other two poor little fami&s;h|ed
creatures calling to their dead mother
for bread.</P>
<P>The &s;ight almo&s;t deprived the man of his
&s;en&s;es. He &s;natched up his two elde&s;t child|ren
in his arms, and ran raving to the hou&s;e
where I was; tearing his hair like a mad|man.
He told me his mournful &s;tory;
with which I was &s;o affected, that I ordered
one of my footmen to carry the two child|ren
home to my hou&s;e directly, and de&s;ired
their father to look out for &s;ome body to take
care of the young one; which he &s;oon did.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="47">
The hone&s;t poor fellow was delighted,
when he came home, to find his two child|ren
well and merry; for they were &s;en&s;ible
of no want but their food. But his grief
returned on him with great violence at the
thoughts of his being obliged to put them
into the hands of people, who, he &s;aid,
he was &s;ure would not be &s;o kind to them
as their own poor mother had been; and my
man told me he did nothing but ki&s;s them,
and cry over them the whole day. To
make his mind ea&s;y at once, I let him know
they &s;hould remain here under his own eye,
'till they were old enough to be put to
&s;chool; and accordingly directed my hou&s;e|keeper
to &s;ee that they were taken care
of; which has made their father very
happy.</P>
<P>The little rogues have found their way
up to me, and I love &s;ome times to hear
them prattle; but this morning the elde&s;t
having told me a lye of his brother, I was
checking him for it when you came in.</P>
<P>My mother was &s;o plea&s;ed with Mr.
Faulkland's conduct in this little hi&s;tory,
that &s;he repeated it to me word for word as
&s;oon as &s;he came home, and concluded with
ob&s;erving, how <HI>good</HI> a <HI>creature</HI> Mr. Faulk|land
mu&s;t be, who in &s;o tender a manner
intere&s;ted him&s;elf in his poor &s;ervant's mis|fortune.
Mo&s;t young gentlemen, &s;aid &s;he,
<PB N="46" REF="48">
would have thought they had done enough
in giving the &s;ervant money to have pro|vided
for his childen how he could: it is in
&s;uch trifles as the&s;e that we often di&s;cover
the excellence of the heart.</P>
<P>You will &s;uppo&s;e, my dear, that I am
not di&s;plea&s;ed at any circum&s;tance that can
rai&s;e Mr. Faulkland's character in my pious
mother's e&s;teem. I heard the &s;tory with
great plea&s;ure; but not making any com|ments
on it, Sir George (who was pre&s;ent
at the relation), &s;aid, Well, Sidney, you
are either very affected, or the greate&s;t &s;toic
in the world; why, any other girl would
be in raptures at &s;uch a proof of the hone&s;t
tenderne&s;s of that heart which &s;he knows &s;he
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es entirely, and on which the whole
of her future happine&s;s depends. I am very
&s;en&s;ible of Mr. Faulkland's worth, brother,
I replied, and I can feel without being tran|&s;ported.
I will be hanged, &s;aid Sir George,
if I think you love Faulkland, at lea&s;t not
half as well as he de&s;erves; and I dare &s;wear
you have not been hone&s;t enough to tell him
yet whether you do or not. It is time e|nough
for that, I replied; if Mr. Faulk|land
and I &s;hould be married, I hope I &s;hall
give him no cau&s;e to complain of my want
of affection.</P>
<P><HI>If</HI> you marry, &s;aid my brother! I know
of no po&s;&s;ible <HI>ifs,</HI> unle&s;s they are of your
<PB N="47" REF="49">
own making. I know of none neither, an|&s;wered
my mother; yet I think Sidney is
in the right to be doubtful about all human
events, Many things, added &s;he gravely,
(for &s;he has a great veneration for old &s;ay|ings),
fall out between the cup and the lip.</P>
<P>I think, mother, &s;aid Sir George, blunt|ly,
<HI>you</HI> were di&s;appointed in your <HI>fir&s;t</HI> love;
I have heard you &s;peak of it, but I forget
the circum&s;tances. As I had never heard
my mother make any mention of this par|ticular,
I begged &s;he would oblige me with
relating it.</P>
<P>When I was about one-and twenty, daugh|ter,
&s;aid &s;he, a match was concluded by
my father between me and a very fine gen|tleman.
I loved him, and (as I &s;uppo&s;e all
young women do in the like circum&s;tances)
believed my&s;elf equally beloved by him.
The court&s;hip had been of a year's &s;tanding;
for you mu&s;t know I was not very ea&s;ily
won. Every thing was &s;ettled, and the
day appointed for our marriage arrived;
when, in&s;tead of the bridegroom, whom
we every minute expected, there came a
letter from him directed to me. The con|tents
were, that having formerly been en|gaged
to a young lady by the mo&s;t &s;olemn
vows, he had, unfortunately for them both,
forgot them all on &s;eeing me, and had broke
through every obligation divine and human
<PB N="48" REF="50">
to obtain me. He intreated mine, and my
family's pardon, in the mo&s;t pathetic man|ner,
for having engaged our e&s;teem &s;o far
as to con&s;ent to an union, of which he
found him&s;elf unworthy, and which it was
impo&s;&s;ible for him to accompli&s;h; for, &s;aid
he, the wrongs I have done the woman,
who&s;e youth I &s;educed, ri&s;e to my imagina|tion
with &s;o much horror, that, for the em|pire
of the world, I would not complete
my guilt, by devoting that hand to another,
to which &s;he only has a right. He enlarged
greatly on the &s;ufferings of his heart, in the
&s;truggle between his love for me, and his
duty to the per&s;on who had his vows; and
whom, he declared, his infidelity had al|mo&s;t
brought to the grave. He claimed
my pity, both on his own and her account;
and repeatedly intreated my forgivene&s;s of
his fault.</P>
<P>The whole letter, which was very long,
was &s;o expre&s;&s;ive of a mind overwhelmed
with de&s;pair, that I was exceedingly &s;hock|ed
at the reading of it. What could I &s;ay?
The plea he offered for his &s;eemingly
&s;trange conduct, was too ju&s;t to admit of
any objections. I own the di&s;appointment
afflicted me, but I bore it with a becoming
re&s;olution. My family were at fir&s;t exceed|ingly
exa&s;perated again&s;t my doubly un|faithful
lover; but, upon enquiring into
<PB N="49" REF="51">
the facts, they found the truth to be as he
had repre&s;ented it. The conclu&s;ion was,
that, upon the very day on which he was to
have been married to me, and on which he
had writ me that gloomy letter, he was
&s;eized with a melancholy, which increa&s;ing
on him daily, &s;oon after ended in ab&s;olute
madne&s;s, and he was obliged to be confined
for the remainder of his life. The young
lady lived but a &s;hort time after the melan|choly
fate of her lover, and died, as it was
&s;aid, of a broken heart.</P>
<P>It was a great comfort to me to reflect that
my fate di&s;po&s;ed otherwi&s;e of me than to
this unhappy gentleman; for I am very
&s;ure, had the&s;e fatal events happened in con|&s;equence
of my marriage with him, that I
&s;hould never have &s;urvived it.</P>
<P>This extraordinary anecdote of my mo|ther's
life, which I had never had a hint of
before (for &s;he could not &s;peak of it with|out
great emotion), very much affected me.
Sir George &s;aid, the &s;tory was more tragical
than he had apprehended, and told my mo|ther,
<HI>that</HI> was an accident which fell out be|tween
the cup and the lip, with a ven|geance.</P>
<P>My mother continued thoughtful for a
good while; and I was &s;orry that the me|mory
of this melancholy &s;tory had been re|vived:
<PB N="50" REF="52">
but Sir George talked and laughed
us both into &s;pirits again.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 6.&mdash;This Mr. Faulkland is a
princely man; he has &s;ent me <HI>&s;uch</HI> a &s;et of
jewels! My mother &s;ays they are too fine
for a private gentlewoman; but George
tells her they are not a bit too fine for Mr.
Faulkland's <HI>wife,</HI> and only &s;uitable to his
fortune. You know I have but few of my
own, tho&s;e only which were my mother's
when &s;he was a maiden. The greate&s;t part
of her's, and by much the fine&s;t, were pre|&s;ented
to her by my father; but tho&s;e &s;he
re&s;erves for Sir George, again&s;t the time of
his marriage, as a pre&s;ent for his lady; for
they are family jewels.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 8.&mdash;My probation is over, my
Cecilia.&mdash;The formidable que&s;tion has been
put to me, and I have an&s;wered it&mdash;Ay
marry, &s;ay you, but how? In the <HI>negative,</HI>
to be &s;ure, my dear&mdash;No, no, my Cecilia;
a valuable (p&s;ha! what an affected cold
word that is), a lovely and mo&s;t worthy
man, with &s;ix thou&s;and pounds a year, is a
prize that a country girl mu&s;t not expect to
draw every day. Mr. Faulkland, in <HI>lover|like</HI>
phra&s;e, demanded from me the time of
his de&s;tined happine&s;s: I referred him to
my mother. She, good and delicate as &s;he
is, referred him back to Sir George.
George blurted out &s;ome &s;udden day that
<PB N="51" REF="53">
&s;tartled us both, when Mr. Faulkland re|ported
it to us. I &s;tammered out &s;ome|thing;
my mother he&s;itated; Sir George
came in, and blundered at us all; &s;o I think
we compounded for the time, and among&s;t
us fixed upon this day month&mdash;And full
&s;oon enough, &s;ays my Cecilia: you have
known the man but about &s;ix weeks, and
&s;urely a month is as little time as you can
take, in preparing fineries. True, my girl,
true; but it is all George's doings. Indeed,
my Cecilia, without affectation, I had much
rather have had a longer day; though I think
I <HI>know</HI> the man as well in tho&s;e &s;ix weeks, as
if I had been acquainted with him &s;o many
years; for he has &s;pent mo&s;t of his hours
with us every day during that time; and
my mother &s;ays he is one of tho&s;e in <HI>whom
there is no guile.</HI></P>
<P>Sir George is downright in&s;olent; he de|clares
I am not &s;en&s;ible of my own happi|ne&s;s,
and that I de&s;erve to be married to
&s;ome little petty Wilt&s;hire '&s;quire. He &s;o
piques him&s;elf upon making this match,
there is no bearing him. He has taken all
matters of &s;ettlement upon him&s;elf, and in|&s;i&s;ts
on my mother's not interpo&s;ing. She
acquie&s;ces, but charges my brother not to
let Mr. Faulkland's genero&s;ity carry him
too far, and bids him remember what is
due to his friend, as well as to his &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="54">
<HI>July</HI> 10.&mdash;I really begin to be hur|ried.
My mother, you know, is exactly
punctilious in every thing. Such a quantity
of things <HI>are</HI> bought, and &s;uch a quantity to
be bought, that there is no end of journies in|to
the city. Then milliners and mantua-ma|kers!&mdash;One
would think I was going to
pa&s;s the remainder of my life in a remote
country, where there were no kind of manu|factures
or artificers to become at, and that
I was to provide cloathing for half a century.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 12&mdash;I have much upon my
hands, and Sir George is &s;o impatient, and
trouble&s;ome, that I believe I mu&s;t employ
an amanuen&s;is, to give a minute detail of
all our foppery; for I &s;hall not have pati|ence
to do it my&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 17.&mdash;Sir George has often told
me, that he knows of no fault Mr. Faulk|land
has, but a violence of temper when
provoked. I &s;aw an in&s;tance of it to-day,
which I was &s;orry for, and the more &s;o, as
I was in &s;ome mea&s;ure acce&s;&s;ary to it. Mr.
Faulkland, my brother, a lady of our ac|quaintance,
and my&s;elf, took a ride in
Hide-park this morning. We were to
dine at Ken&s;ington (where my mother was
to meet us), at the hou&s;e of the lady (a
relation of Mr. Faulkland's), who was
with us.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="55">
We rode into the &s;table-yard of her hou&s;e,
in order to alight. My hor&s;e which hap|pened
to be a young one that Sir George
had newly bought, &s;aw &s;ome object that
made him &s;hy of advancing, and he turned
&s;uddenly about. A footman of Mr. Faulk|land's,
who chanced to &s;tand ju&s;t behind
me, very imprudently, though I am &s;ure
without de&s;ign of harm, gave him a &s;troke
with his whip, which made the animal
plunge and throw me, as I had not time to
recover my &s;eat from the fir&s;t &s;hort turn he
made. I luckily received not the lea&s;t hurt,
and was on my feet in an in&s;tant. But Mr.
Faulkland, who had leaped off his hor&s;e
even before I fell, was &s;o enraged at the
fellow, that he gave him too or three &s;ound
la&s;hes with his whip acro&s;s the &s;houlders,
which fell on him as quick as lightning. I
am inclined to think the &s;ervant was not &s;o|ber;
for he had the in&s;olence to lay hold of
his ma&s;ter's whip, and muttered an oath or
two &punc; Mr. Faulkland's attention being quick|ly
turned to me, he took no farther notice
of the man. We went into the hou&s;e; and
after I had a&s;&s;ured them all I was not in the
lea&s;t hurt, I begged of Mr. Faulkland to
forgive the footman, who had unde&s;ignedly
cau&s;ed the accident. He made a thou&s;and
apologies, for having let his anger &s;o far
<PB N="54" REF="56">
tran&s;port him, as to cha&s;ti&s;e his &s;ervant in a
manner he was not u&s;ed to do; but the pe|ril
he put me into, madam addre&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf
to me, made me forget my&s;elf. I repeat|ed,
I hope, Sir, you have forgiven him. I
wi&s;h, my dear Mi&s;s Bidulph, &s;aid he, that
the fellow were guilty of no other fault but
this, that I might &s;hew you my readine&s;s to
obey you; but he is &s;uch an intolerable &s;ot,
that there is no keeping him with &s;afety. I
have forgiven him &s;everal idle things; but as
I had determined to part with him before
this happened, I hope you will be &s;o good
as not to in&s;i&s;t on my retaining him. I could
not intercede for the fooli&s;h fellow after this;
&s;o &s;aid no more.</P>
<P>This little incident convinces me that Mr.
Faulkland is of too warm a temper; yet I
am not alarmed at the di&s;covery; you know
I am the very rever&s;e; and I hope in time,
by gentle methods, in &s;ome mea&s;ure to &s;ub|due
it in Mr. Faulkland. His own good
&s;en&s;e and good nature mu&s;t incline him to
wi&s;h it corrected. My brother &s;ays he has
often lamented this vice of his nature to him,
and &s;aid he had taken infinite pains to get
the better of it; and had &s;o far &s;ucceeded,
that he &s;eldom was &s;urprized by it, but on
very &s;udden and extraordinary occa&s;ions;
<PB N="55" REF="57">
&s;uch as, I &s;uppo&s;e, he looked upon this to
be, which I have related.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed the day delightfully at Ken|&s;ington,
and did not return to town till late.
I think I have got cold, as we walked a long
time in the gardens.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 13.&mdash;I have got an ugly &s;ore
throat; my mother in&s;i&s;ts on my being let
blood; I am afraid of alarming her by com|plaining,
though I had very little re&s;t all
night. Mr. Faulkland came early this
morning to enquire after my health: my
mother told him I was not well. How
tenderly dejected were his looks, when I
came into the room. Sir George made him
&s;tay to breakfa&s;t; he &s;carce ta&s;ted any thing;
he was quite ca&s;t down. My brother rallied
him (I thought it un&s;ea&s;onable) on the chance
he had the day before of his lo&s;ing his wife.
Mr. Faulkland an&s;wered, I wi&s;h I had fol|lowed
the fir&s;t motion of my thoughts, and
di&s;charged that wicked fellow a month ago.
Sir George &s;aid, as it happened, there had
been no harm done; but he thought Mr.
Faulkland would do well to di&s;mi&s;s &s;uch an
in&s;olent rogue from his &s;ervice. He has
&s;aved me that trouble, &s;aid Mr. Faulkland, he
has di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him&s;elf; but took care fir&s;t to
rob me. To rob you! we all repeated in
the &s;ame breath. Yes, &s;aid Mr. Faulkland:
I told him, after I got home, that he was
<PB N="56" REF="58">
to deliver up &s;uch things as he had in his charge
to my own man, as I meant to di&s;charge
him in the morning. He made me no re|ply,
for he was a &s;ullen fellow; but when
the family were a&s;leep, he contrived to pick
the lock of a bureau in my dre&s;&s;ing room,
where I &s;ometimes keep money. I believe
what induced him to it was, his having
&s;een me ye&s;terday morning, when I was go|ing
to ride, (a precaution which I generally
u&s;e), put my pocket book into this place,
and I &s;uppo&s;e he concluded there were bank
notes in it, for he took <HI>that</HI> (I pre&s;ume with|out
&s;taying to examine it) and all the mo|ney
he could find be&s;ides, and very cleverly
made his e&s;cape out of a back window,
which was found open this morning.</P>
<P>My mother lectured Mr. Faulkland a
little, for &s;uffering a &s;ervant, who&s;e fidelity
he was not &s;ure of, to &s;ee where he depo&s;ited
his money; which, &s;he &s;aid, might prove
a temptation to one, who was <HI>not</HI> &s;o ill in|clined
as this man. Mr. Faulkland ac|knowledged
it was carele&s;s in him; but &s;aid,
in his own ju&s;tification, he had been accu&s;tomed
to very hone&s;t people about him, which
rendered him le&s;s &s;u&s;picious.</P>
<P>He appeared &s;o anxious and unhappy
about my indi&s;po&s;ition, that I affected to
make as light of it as po&s;&s;ible; though in|deed
I find my&s;elf very much out of order.
<PB N="57" REF="59">
With what a kind &s;orrow did he ob&s;erve
my looks; &s;ighs now and then &s;tole from
him, as his eyes were fixed on my face. I
am obliged to him, yet I think I &s;hould
be as much concerned for <HI>him,</HI> if he were
ill.</P>
<P>Here is a whole cargo of &s;ilks and laces
ju&s;t &s;ent in to me&mdash;Heigh-ho! I can't look
at them&mdash;I am not well&mdash;and I have &s;uch a
gantlope to run of vi&s;iting and racketting,
that the thought makes me &s;icker.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 27.&mdash;After 2 fortnight's, a dread|ful
fortnight's intermi&s;&s;ion, I rea&s;&s;ume my
pen. I have often told you, Cecilia, I was
not born to be happy. Oh! I prophe&s;ied
when I &s;aid &s;o, though I knew not why I
&s;aid it.</P>
<P>I will try to recollect all the circum&s;tances
of this mi&s;erable interval, and relate them
as well as I can. The la&s;t line in my jour|nal
(which I have not yet ventured to &s;end
you, as your &s;tay at Paris is &s;o uncertain)
informs you that I was ill. I was let blood;
but my di&s;order increa&s;ed, and I was in a
high fever before next morning. I remem|ber
what my reflections were, and am &s;ure
my apprehen&s;ions of death were not on my
<HI>own</HI> account afflicting, but grievou&s;ly &s;o at
the thoughts of what tho&s;e &s;hould feel
whom I was to leave behind.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="60">
My mother and Mr. Faulkland, I believe,
chiefly engaged my mind; but I did not
long continue capable of reflection. The
violence of my di&s;order deprived me of
my &s;en&s;es on the fourth day, and they tell
me I raved of Mr. Faulkland. I remem|ber
nothing, but that, in my intervals of
rea&s;on, I always &s;aw my poor mother in
tears by my bed&s;ide. I was in the utmo&s;t
danger, but it plea&s;ed God to re&s;tore me to
the ardent prayers of my dear parent. In
about ten days I began to &s;hew &s;ome &s;ymp|toms
of amendment, and enquired how
Mr. Faulkland did. My mother an&s;wered,
he is well, my dear, and gone out of town, but
I believe will return in a day or two. Gone
out of town, &s;aid I, and leave my dying! In|deed
that was not kind of Mr. Faulkland, and
I &s;hall tell him &s;o. My mother was &s;itting on
the bed&s;ide, and had hold of my hand;
my brother was &s;tanding with his back to
the fire place. I ob&s;erved they looked at
one another, but neither made me any an|&s;wer.
Pray, Sir George, I cried, would
you &s;erve the woman &s;o whom you were &s;o
near making your wife? My brother was
going to reply, but my mother frowned at
him; he looked di&s;plea&s;ed, and went out
of the room. Dear madam, &s;aid I, there
is &s;omething the matter with Mr. Faulkland;
don't keep me in &s;u&s;pence. I <HI>know</HI> there
is &s;omething, which you and my brother
<PB N="59" REF="61">
would conceal from me. Is Mr. Faulkland
&s;ick? not that I know of I a&s;&s;ure you, an|&s;wered
my mother; he was well ye&s;terday,
for we had a me&s;&s;age from him to enquire af|ter
your health, as we have had every day,
for he is but at Richmond; and you know if
he were in town, he could receive no other &s;a|tisfaction
than hearing from you, as you are
too ill to admit of any vi&s;its. My mother
rang the bell immediately, and a&s;ked me to
take &s;omething; I &s;aw &s;he wanted to turn
the conver&s;ation. My maid Ellen came into
the room, and I a&s;ked no more que&s;tions.</P>
<P>My mother &s;taid with me till it was time
for her to go to re&s;t; but avoided mention|ing
Mr. Faulkland's name, or giving me
any opportunity of doing it; for &s;he tenderly
conjured me to keep my&s;elf quite compo&s;ed,
and not to talk. The doctor a&s;&s;ured her this
night that he thought me out of danger;
and &s;he retired with looks of cordial de|light.</P>
<P>She was no &s;ooner gone, than I called El|len
to my bed&s;ide, and charged her to tell
me all &s;he knew concerning Mr. Faulkland.
The poor girl looked concerned, and &s;eemed
to &s;tudy for an an&s;wer. Lord ble&s;s me,
madam! what &s;hould I know of him more
than my lady has told you? When did you
&s;ee him, &s;aid I? Not for &s;everal days, &s;he
an&s;wered. Where is he? At Richmond, I
<PB N="60" REF="62">
heard Sir George &s;ay; but I &s;uppo&s;e he will
come to town as &s;oon as he hears you are well
enough to receive him. I catched hold of
her hand; &startq;Ellen, I know there is &s;ome|thing,
relative to Mr. Faulkland, which
which you all want to hide from me; don't
attempt to deceive me; you may be &s;ure,
whatever it be, I mu&s;t &s;oon be informed of
it; in the mean while, my doubts make
me very unhappy.&endq;</P>
<P>The good-natured girl's trouble and con|fu&s;ion
increa&s;ed as I &s;poke: my dear madam,
&s;he replied, when you are better, my lady
will tell you all: &startq;No, no, Ellen, I mu&s;t
know it now; tell it me this minute, or
you mu&s;t never expect to &s;ee me better
under &s;uch uncertainty. What is the <HI>all,</HI>
the frightful <HI>all,</HI> that I am to be told? How
you have &s;hocked me with that little word!&endq;
I know nothing, madam, an&s;wered Ellen,
but what I gathered from Sir George's loud
angry talk with my lady; and I &s;hould be
undone if her lady&s;hip were to know I men|tioned
it to you. I a&s;&s;ured her my mother
&s;hould not know it. Why then, madam,
(&s;peaking lower,) I am afraid that Mr. Faulk|land
has mi&s;behaved, or has been belied
to my lady&mdash;She &s;topped at this&mdash;How?
how? cried I eagerly; what, has &s;he heard
of him? &s;omething of another court&s;hip,
&s;he replied; but I hope it is all fal&s;e&mdash;You
<PB N="61" REF="63">
trifle with me&mdash;&s;peak out and &s;ay all you
know. The poor creature &s;tarted at my
impatience: &startq;I know no more, madam,
than that I heard my lady &s;ay to Sir George,
I had rather Sidney were in her grave,
than married to him. Sir George &s;aid,
but why will you not let Mr. Faulkland
ju&s;tify him&s;elf, madam? ju&s;tify him&s;elf!
my lady an&s;wered; what can he &s;ay? is it
not plain that he is fal&s;e to another woman?
they talked lower; but at la&s;t Sir George
rai&s;ed his voice, and &s;aid, he would give
half his e&s;tate to have the villain puni&s;hed
&mdash;All this, madam, I over-heard by
mere accident. Sir George was going
abroad; his linen was lying ready for him
in his dre&s;&s;ing-room; and his man de&s;ired
me to put a &s;titch in one of his ma&s;ter's
point ruffles which was a little ripped in the
gathering. I had come up the back &s;tairs
into the dre&s;&s;ing-room, ju&s;t as my lady
(who was with Sir George in the bed-chamber)
&s;aid the words I fir&s;t repeated &punc;
and while I &s;tood doing the ruffle, I heard
the re&s;t. There was a great deal more
&s;aid, but I could not di&s;tingui&s;h any thing
be&s;ides, except a word here and there,
which Sir George &s;eemed to &s;peak in a
very angry tone. This was the &s;econd
day of your illne&s;s. Mr. Faulkland had
been here in the morning to enquire how
<PB N="62" REF="64">
you did; my lady &s;aw him, and I thought
they parted very friendly. I met Mr.
Faulkland coming down &s;tairs; he looked
full of grief; my lady &s;tood at the dining-room
door, and wi&s;hed him a good morn|ing.
About an hour after came a letter
directed to you; it was brought by a por|ter,
who &s;aid it required no an&s;wer. As
you were too ill to read it, I gave it to my
lady; and it was &s;oon after this, that I
heard the conver&s;ation between Sir George
and her lady&s;hip. Mr. Faulkland came
again in the evening. Sir George was not
at home; but my lady had him above an
hour in the drawing-room; and the foot|man,
who let him out, &s;aid, he looked as
if he were in &s;ad trouble. He has never
been here &s;ince, but &s;ends con&s;tantly every
day to know how you do. My lady or|dered
me, if any letters came for you, to
deliver them to her. And has there any
come to me? No, madam; word was al|ways
&s;ent to Mr. Faulkland of your being
&s;o ill, that to be &s;ure he thought it would
be in vain for him to write to you.&endq;</P>
<P>This was all I could gather from the maid.
What a night did I pa&s;s? I &s;carce clo&s;ed my
eyes. Ellen lay in a field-bed by me; &s;he
had watched &s;everal nights, and I obliged
her now to undre&s;s and go into bed. She
&s;lept &s;oundly; how I envied her tranquillity!
<PB N="63" REF="65">
If I forgot my&s;elf for a few minutes, my
&s;lumbers were di&s;tracted, and I &s;tarted at the
recollection of what I had already heard, and
the dread of what I had <HI>&s;till</HI> to hear. Mr.
Faulkland ab&s;enting him&s;elf from the hou&s;e
&s;o long; my mother wi&s;hing me in the
grave, rather than be his wife; my brother
denouncing vengeance on the <HI>villain!</HI> The&s;e
were the terrible ideas that haunted me till
morning. What can he have done, I cried
aloud &s;everal times? I &s;ummoned to my aid
all the fortitude I was mi&s;tre&s;s of, and re|&s;olved
not to &s;ink under the calamity, be it
of what nature it would.</P>
<P>My mother, ever kind and tender, came
early the next morning into my room. She
enquired after my health, and looked as if
&s;he <HI>pitied</HI> me. I was ready to cry at her
compa&s;&s;ionate glances; they mortified me,
but I was determined not to let her perceive
it. I told her I was much better; and, what
is &s;urpri&s;ing, I was really &s;o, notwith&s;tand|ing
the unea&s;y &s;tate of my mind. She talked
of indifferent things, and &s;aid, &s;he hoped I
&s;hould &s;oon be able to go into the country
for a few days, to recover a little &s;trength.
I an&s;wered, I hope &s;o too, madam. We
were both &s;ilent for a while; my mother had
her indulgent eyes fixed upon me; mine
were ca&s;t down: at la&s;t I re&s;olved to &s;peak
out. Madam, &s;aid I, looking &s;teadfa&s;tly
<PB N="64" REF="66">
at her, what is the cau&s;e of your coldne&s;s to|wards
Mr. Faulkland? its in vain for you to
hide it longer; you &s;ay he is <HI>well,</HI> and gone
out of town. If he has &s;hewn any &s;light to|wards
me, tell me &s;o at once; and do not en|tertain
&s;o mean an opinion of your daughter,
as to &s;uppo&s;e &s;he cannot bear the news.
Your tenderne&s;s, I &s;ee, would conceal <HI>&s;ome|thing</HI>
from me; but believe me, madam,
I am prepared for the wor&s;t.</P>
<P>My dear, replied my mother, it gives me
great plea&s;ure to hear you &s;ay &s;o. I pray
God pre&s;erve my child, and grant her a bet|ter
lot than &s;he could hope for in a union
with Mr. Faulkland. What has he done,
madam? my deare&s;t Sidney, this is the fir&s;t
trial you have ever had of your patience;
but I have no doubt that your goodne&s;s and
di&s;cretion will teach you to act as becomes
your character.</P>
<P>I did not intend to have &s;poken to you on
the &s;ubject, 'till you were better able to bear
the knowledge of what I am going to ac|quaint
you with; but your prudence, I
think, makes you equal to every thing;
and I hope your health will not be endan|gered
by the di&s;covery of Mr. Faulkland's
ba&s;ene&s;s. (What a dreadful preface!)</P>
<P>The day after you were taken ill, a letter,
directed to you, was brought hither by a
porter, which your maid (very di&s;creetly)
<PB N="65" REF="67">
delivered to me. As you were not in a con|dition
to read it your&s;elf, I thought proper
to open it. The cover contained a few
lines addre&s;&s;ed to you; and in it was inclo&s;ed
a letter directed to Mr. Faulkland. Good
God, added &s;he, taking the papers out of
her pocket, how little reliance ought we to
have on a fair out-&s;ide!</P>
<P>Here are the letters; read what is in the
cover fir&s;t. I did &s;o; it was ill writ and
wor&s;e &s;pelt. The&s;e were the contents:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I hear you are &s;oon to be married to Mr.
Faulkland; but as I think it a great pity that
&s;o virtuous a young Lady &s;hould be thrown
away, this is to inform you, that he does
not de&s;erve you.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ed letter, wrote to him by a
fine and beautiful young lady that he decoy|ed,
&s;hews you how fal&s;e he is. When you
tax him with it, he will know from whence
you got your information; but let him deny
it if he can.</P>
<CLOSER>I am, madam,
Your unknown friend,
and humble &s;ervant.</CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The letter to Mr. Faulkland, in a very
pretty female hand, and the date but a week
old (from the time it was &s;ent to me) was as
follows:</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="68">
&startq;Oh! Mr. Faulkland, I am the mo&s;t
unfortunate woman in the world Fatal have
you been to me, and I am undone for ever&mdash;
I was in hopes that our mutual fault might
have been concealed; for while we &s;tayed
at Bath, I kept my aunt entirely ignorant of
what pa&s;&s;ed between us, though &s;he often
pre&s;&s;ed me to confe&s;s the truth; but it can
now no longer be concealed. I am but too
&s;en&s;ibly reminded of the unhappy con&s;e|quences
of my own weakne&s;s, and your un|governed
(would I could call it) love. I ne|ver
meant to trouble you with complaints;
but my pre&s;ent condition calls loudly for your
compa&s;&s;ion. Are you then really going to
be married? There wants but this to com|plete
my de&s;truction! Oh! Sir, before it is
too late, take pity on me! I dare not con|tinue
in the hou&s;e with my uncle much long|er.
My aunt &s;ays, that, when my affliction
becomes &s;o con&s;picuous as not to be any
longer hid, &s;he will form a pretence, on ac|count
of my health, for me to be ab&s;ent
for &s;ome months, under colour of going to
Bath, or to London, for better advice than
I can have here. But what will this avail me?
I have no relations, no friends, nor acquaint|ance,
that I can tru&s;t with the &s;ecret of my
mi&s;erable &s;ituation. To whom then can I
fly, but to you, the cau&s;e of all my &s;orrow?
I be&s;eech you for heaven's &s;ake, write to me,
<PB N="67" REF="69">
and tell me, if indeed you are going to give
your&s;elf away for ever! If you are, your in|tended
bride, perhaps, may have no other
advantage of me, but what you in an evil
hour deprived me of. Write to me, dear,
though cruel as you are; and think of &s;ome
place of refuge for your unhappy</P>
<P>A. B.&endq;</P>
<P>When I had read the&s;e letters, my mo|ther
a&s;ked me, what I thought of Mr. Faulk|land?
indeed, I was &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed, that I
&s;carce knew what an&s;wer to make; but re|plied,
madam, are you &s;atisfied, that this
letter is not forged, with a de&s;ign to injure
Mr. Faulkland? Ah! my dear, &s;aid &s;he, I
am &s;orry you &s;trive to catch at &s;o &s;lender a
twig; you may be &s;ure I am but too well
convinced that the letter is genuine, or you
&s;hould never have had a moment's unea&s;ine&s;s
by the knowledge of it. Mr. Faulkland
him&s;elf does not deny it, and it is with his
permi&s;&s;ion that I kept it. I promi&s;ed to re|turn
it, but de&s;ired leave to retain it for a
few days. He could not refu&s;e me this, tho'
he might ea&s;ily imagine I de&s;igned to &s;hew it
to you. That, indeed, <HI>was</HI> my intention,
when I de&s;ired to keep it a little while in my
hands, and I did &s;o, that I might have your
judgment on the letter it&s;elf, as well as fully
to ju&s;tify my own proceedings in what I have
done. Ah! dear madam, cry'd I, &s;carce
<PB N="68" REF="70">
knowing what I &s;aid, I rely on your mate|rial
goodne&s;s; I am &s;ure you have done
what is proper. Yet has Mr. Faulkland no|thing
to &s;ay for him&s;elf?&mdash;But I will a&s;k
no more que&s;tions&mdash;I know too much al|ready&mdash;My
love, &s;aid my mother, you have
a right to know every thing relative to this
affair.</P>
<P>I &s;hewed the letters to your brother, as
&s;oon as I received them. Sir George at fir&s;t
&s;eemed quite confounded, but afterwards,
to my very great &s;urprize, he &s;miled and
&s;aid, he knew of that fooli&s;h bu&s;ine&s;s before.
I a&s;ked him, if he knew of him before, how
he could an&s;wer it to his honour, his con&s;ci|ence,
or the love he ought to bear his &s;i&s;ter,
not to divulge it immediately? Why, &s;aid
he, I a&s;&s;ure you it is a <HI>trivial</HI> affair, that
ought not to make you unea&s;y.</P>
<P>What, George! an&s;wered I, a trivial
matter for a man to ruin a fine young lady,
for&s;ake her, and dare to involve an innocent
creature in his crimes! Do you call this a
<HI>trivial</HI> affair? If you knew the <HI>circum&s;tances,</HI>
&s;aid he, you would not view it in &s;o di&s;ad|vantageous
a light. Faulkland certainly
gained the affections of a young lady, tho'
without &s;eeking to do &s;o; he never courted
her, never attempted to plea&s;e her, much
le&s;s to win her heart, and lea&s;t of all to ruin
her virtue. I know that is an action he is
<PB N="69" REF="71">
not capable of committing. How comes it
to pa&s;s then that he <HI>did</HI> &s;o, &s;aid I, interrupt|ing
him? Why, the girl was &s;illy, and &s;he
was thrown in his way by a vile de&s;igning
woman that had the care of her. &startq;And
was he (again &s;topping him) to take
advantage of her folly, and join with that
<HI>vile de&s;igning</HI> woman, to de&s;troy a poor
young creature's honour?&endq; The <HI>be&s;t</HI> men,
&s;aid he, confidently, may fall into an error;
and if you expect to find a man entirely free
from them, you look for what is not po&s;&s;i|ble
in human nature.</P>
<P>I may expect to find a man without fla|grant
crimes to an&s;wer for, I hope; and I be|lieve
I &s;poke it with warmth. Do you call
<HI>this</HI> one, madam, &s;aid he, with &s;till more
a&s;&s;urance? I hope Sidney will not be &s;uch a
chit as to think in this manner, when &s;he
comes to hear the affair explained. I really
grew down-right angry, and could not for|bear
&s;aying, I would rather &s;ee you married
to your grave than to &s;uch a man. Your
brother then begged I would hear Mr.
Faulkland <HI>ju&s;tified,</HI> and be a little cool 'till
that was done. I told him there was a terri|ble
fact alledged, of which I could not con|ceive
it po&s;&s;ible for him to acquit him&s;elf.</P>
<P>George &s;aid, he had a letter to &s;hew me
on the &s;ubject, which he had received from
Mr. Faulkland while he was at Bath, and
<PB N="70" REF="72">
which he was &s;ure would convince me, that
the whole affair was &s;o trifling, it ought by
no means to be objected to Mr. Faulkland,
nor, in his opinion, even mentioned to him.</P>
<P>I told him I was &s;orry to find that he and I
thought &s;o differently; for that I was de|termined
to &s;peak to Mr. Faulkland imme|diately
about it, and, if he could not &s;atisfy
me entirely on the &s;core of the injured lady,
that he mu&s;t never think of Sidney more.</P>
<P>Your brother &s;aid, that the letter which
was &s;ent to you had come from the revenge|ful
dog who had robbed his ma&s;ter, and that
he would give half his e&s;tate to have the vil|lain
puni&s;hed as he de&s;erved. Mr. Faulk|land,
it &s;eems, had told him this him&s;elf.
The fellow found it in the pocket-book which
he had taken out of the e&s;crutore, and his
di&s;appointment, perhaps, at not getting a
better booty, (for he found but twenty moi|dores
be&s;ides,) joined to his malice again&s;t
his ma&s;ter, incited him to make the u&s;e he
did of this letter. Now, continued my mo|ther,
though the fellow is undoubtedly a vile
creature, yet, my dear, I think <HI>we</HI> are
obliged to him for this di&s;covery, providen|tially
as it has come, to &s;ave you from what,
in my opinion, would be the wor&s;t of mis|fortunes.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of this letter had alarmed Mr.
Faulkland &s;o much, that he put an adver|ti&s;ement
<PB N="71" REF="73">
into the papers next day, worded
in &s;o particular a manner, as &s;hewed how
very fearful he was of that letter's coming
to light; for, no doubt, he &s;u&s;pected the
man might make a dangerous u&s;e of it.
The adverti&s;ement &s;aid, that if the &s;ervant,
who had ab&s;conded from his ma&s;ter's hou&s;e
in St. James's Square the night before,
would re&s;tore the papers which he took with
him, they &s;hould be received without any
que&s;tions being a&s;ked, and a reward of
twenty guineas paid to any per&s;on who
&s;hould bring them back. This adverti&s;e|ment,
which, to be &s;ure, the fellow either
did not &s;ee at all, or had not time enough to
avail him&s;elf of it, &s;hews you to what &s;ad
re&s;ources people are driven, who, having
done unwarrantable actions, are often in the
power of the lowe&s;t wretches. I own this
circum&s;tance gave me a very ill impre&s;&s;ion
of Mr. Faulkland. Your brother &s;ays, he
remembers this man was one of the &s;er|vants
he took with him to Bath, and with|out
doubt, he knew of his amour. The
adverti&s;ement has &s;ince been changed, by
Sir George's advice. I find the man is
named, his per&s;on de&s;cribed, and a reward
of fifty pounds offered for the apprehending
him; but I take it for granted he has got
out of reach.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="74">
Though this little digre&s;&s;ion was very
pertinent, I was impatient to know what had
pa&s;&s;ed between my mother and Mr. Faulk|land
on the fatal &s;ubject, and could not for|bear
a&s;king her.</P>
<P>I &s;hall tell you, &s;aid &s;he, in order. Your
brother and I had &s;ome farther altercations;
and indeed, my dear, it amazes me to find,
that a young man, educated as Sir George
was, in the early part of life, in the &s;tricte&s;t
principles of virtue, and the &s;on of parents,
who, thank God, always gave him the be&s;t
example, &s;hould have &s;o far deviated from
the &s;ober paths he was brought up in, as to
treat the mo&s;t glaring vices with a levity that
&s;hocked me. But, I &s;uppo&s;e, the company
he kept abroad, among whom this hypocrite
Faulkland was his chief, has quite perverted
him. He gave me the letter to read, which
he had received from his friend whil&s;t he was
at Bath; and which, he &s;aid, was to con|vince
me that it was &s;uch a <HI>trifling</HI> affair,
that we ought not to take the lea&s;t notice of
it. And all his rea&s;on for this was, truly,
becau&s;e that loo&s;e man treats the &s;ubject as
lightly as he does. I am afraid Sir George
is no better than him&s;elf, or he would not
have ventured to make him the confidant of
his wild amours; and that at a time too
when he was encouraged to addre&s;s you.
He tells him of a very pretty young lady (in|nocent
<PB N="73" REF="75">
he &s;ays too) that he got acquainted
with, who came to Bath under the care of
an aunt and uncle; he talks &s;ome idle &s;tuff
of avoiding her, when he found &s;he liked
him, and that the aunt (wicked woman!)
contrived to leave them together one even|ing,
when, I under&s;tand, the poor young
creature fell into the &s;nare that was prepared
for her. For, would you believe it, my dear,
the mon&s;trous libertine, notwith&s;tanding his
pretences, owned that he had paid a price for
the girl to her aunt. The betrayed creature
her&s;elf knew not of this.</P>
<P>I own I had not patience to read the letter
through. To &s;ay the truth, I but ran my
eye in a cur&s;ory manner over it; I was afraid
of meeting, at every line, &s;omething offen|&s;ive
to decency. And <HI>this</HI> was the account,
which, in your brother's opinion, was en|tirely
to exculpate Mr. Faulkland. I think
I never was &s;o angry. I threw the letter to
George with indignation, telling him, I
was a&s;hamed to find, that he, after knowing
an incident of this kind, had &s;o little regard
to the honour of his &s;i&s;ter, as to promote a
marriage between her and &s;uch a rake. He
an&s;wered, if I kept you unmarried till I
found &s;uch a man as <HI>I</HI> &s;hould <HI>not</HI> call a rake,
you were likely to live and die a maid. That
for his part, he was very &s;orry, as well for
Mr. Faulkland's &s;ake as yours, he had ever
<PB N="74" REF="76">
propo&s;ed a union, which he found was likely
to be overthrown by un&s;ea&s;onable &s;cruples.
And the gentleman, in a violent pa&s;&s;ion,
flung out of the room, without deign|ing
even to take up the letter which had
fallen on the floor.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume he went directly to his friend
Faulkland, and told him all that had pa&s;&s;ed;
for the plau&s;ible man came to me in the even|ing,
and with looks, full of pretended &s;or|row,
but <HI>real</HI> guilt, begged I would hear
him on the &s;ubject of a letter which he &s;aid
he found had unfortunately prejudiced me
again&s;t him. To be &s;ure he was prepared,
and had, with George's help, contrived an
artful &s;tory to impo&s;e on me. $e took me
unawares; but I was re&s;olved not to give him
the advantage of arguments, but proceed to
a&s;k him a few plain que&s;tions. I therefore
cut him &s;hort at once, by &s;aying, Mr. Faulk|land,
I am extremely concerned and &s;hocked
at what has happened; I will &s;ay but few
words to you, and de&s;ire to hear nothing
more than an&s;wers to my que&s;tions: he bow|ed,
and remained &s;ilent.</P>
<P>I then a&s;ked him, taking the young lady's
letter out of my pocket, whether that was
from the &s;ame per&s;on, of whom he had
written an account to my &s;on whil&s;t he was
at Bath? He an&s;wered, it is, madam; and
I hoped from that letter, which I find Sir
<PB N="75" REF="77">
George has &s;hewn you, you would be in|duced
to believe that I never formed a
thought of injuring that young lady, till &s;ome
unfortunate circum&s;tances combined, and
&s;uddenly &s;urprized me into the commi&s;&s;ion
of a fault that has made us both unhappy.
Sir, &s;aid I, I don't pretend to know people's
hearts, I can only judge of them from their
actions. You acknowledge that &s;he was a
fine young woman, and you believe innocent:
what excu&s;e can you offer for being her de|&s;troyer?
dear madam, don't u&s;e &s;o &s;evere an
expre&s;&s;ion&mdash;Sir, I can u&s;e no other: how
can you extenuate the fault, by which you
merit &s;o &s;evere an appellation? to a lady of
your rigid delicacy, madam, &s;aid he, per|haps
what youth could offer, in extenuation
of the fault, might appear but a weak plea:
yet 'tis mo&s;t certain, that I was &s;urprized in|to
the fatal error: I am under no promi&s;es,
no ties, no engagements what&s;oever to the
lady. No ties, Sir! (interupting him) is
your own honour no tie upon you, &s;uppo&s;ing
you free from any other obligation? You &s;ee
the con&s;equence of this fatal error, as you call
it: here is a young per&s;on, of fa&s;hion, perhaps
(I don't enquire who &s;he is, but &s;he &s;eems to
have had no mean education,) who is likely
to bring a child into the world, to the di&s;|grace
of her&s;elf and her family. On you,
Sir, &s;he charges her di&s;honour, and men|tions
<PB N="76" REF="78">
your marrying another, as the blow
which is to complete her ruin. Mr. Faulk|land,
is not all this truth? be &s;o good as to
give me a direct an&s;wer. Madam, I cannot
deny it; you have the proof of it in your
hands: from all that appears to you, I am
indeed very blameable; nay, I do not pre|tend
to vindicate my folly; but, madam, do
not aggravate my fault in your own thoughts,
by con&s;idering the affair in a more unfavoura|ble
light than what even her letter puts it! I
conjure you, madam, to &s;uffer Sir George
to be my advocate on this occa&s;ion; he is
acquainted with every particular of the
tran&s;action, and can give you a detail that I
will not pre&s;ume to do. Be plea&s;ed, Sir,
replied I, to tell me what you mean to do
in regard to this lady? I mean to do all that
I <HI>can</HI> do, an&s;wered he; I &s;hall provide a
place of retreat for her, where &s;he will meet
with the utmo&s;t care, tenderne&s;s, and re&s;pect;
and where &s;he may continue with privacy till
&s;he is in a condition to return home again to
her friends. You may be &s;ure, madam, as
to the re&s;t, I &s;hall acquit my&s;elf con&s;i&s;tently
with honour. That is as much as to &s;ay,
Sir, &s;aid I, that you will take care of the
maintenance of your poor babe. He looked
as if he had a mind to &s;mile, forward man!
but con&s;trained it. Doubtle&s;s, madam, I
<PB N="77" REF="79">
&s;hall do all that is now in my power to do,
in every circum&s;tance relating to her.</P>
<P>I felt my&s;elf exceedingly di&s;plea&s;ed with
him; I was &s;o di&s;appointed in my opinion
of him, that it increa&s;ed my re&s;entment.
Sir, I proceeded, I mu&s;t inform you, that
there is as much <HI>now</HI> in your power as ever
there was. You are &s;till unmarried; the
way is open to you, to repair the mi&s;chief
you have done: I will never bring down the
cur&s;es of an injured maid upon my daugh|ter's
head, nor purcha&s;e her worldly pro&s;pe|rity
at the expence of the &s;hame and &s;orrow
of another woman, for aught I know, as
well born, as tenderly bred, and, till &s;he
knew you, perhaps as innocent as her&s;elf.
For heaven's &s;ake, madam, he cry'd, don't,
don't, I be&s;eech you, pronounce my fate &s;o
ha&s;tily&mdash;You mu&s;t pardon me, Sir, &s;aid I,
if I beg to hear no more on this &s;ubject.
Sir George has already &s;aid every thing you
could expect of your friend to &s;ay in your
ju&s;tification, and more than became him to
utter. All I can find by either you or him,
is, that you think the lo&s;s of honour to a
young woman is a trifle, which a man is not
obliged to repair, becau&s;e truly he did not
<HI>promi&s;e</HI> to do &s;o. This young creature, I
under&s;tand, is a gentlewoman, very charm|ing
in her per&s;on, by your own account;
one who loves you tenderly, and will &s;hortly
<PB N="78" REF="80">
make you a father. Is not all this &s;o? I
grant it, madam, &s;aid the criminal. Then,
Sir, what rea&s;on can you urge in your con|&s;cience
for not doing her ju&s;tice? None&mdash;
but your own incon&s;tant inclinations, which
happen now, to be better plea&s;ed with ano|ther
woman, whom, perhaps, you might
for&s;ake in a few months.</P>
<P>I cannot pretend to repeat to you all he &s;aid
upon this la&s;t article: words of cour&s;e, you
may be &s;ure. He entreated, over and over
again, that I would permit Sir George to
plead for him. I told him, that after the
facts he had granted, it was impo&s;&s;ible that
either he or Sir George could make the affair
better; that I was very &s;orry to find my&s;elf
di&s;appointed in a per&s;on of whom I had con|ceived
&s;o high an opinion; and added, that
as your illne&s;s made it very improper to let
you know any thing of the matter for the
pre&s;ent, I &s;hould take it as a favour, if he
would permit me to retain the lady's letter to
him for a few days, or till you were in a
condition to have the matter broke to you.
In the mean while, I reque&s;ted that he would
di&s;pen&s;e with my receiving any more vi&s;its
from him.</P>
<P>He &s;aid &s;ome frantic things (for the man
&s;eems of a violent temper;) but finding me
peremptory, took his leave with re&s;pect.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="81">
I under&s;tand from Sir George, that he
flew directly down to Richmond, to a little
hou&s;e he has there, where he has remained
ever &s;ince; but &s;ends every day to enquire
after your health. Sir George, I am &s;ure,
&s;ees him often; for he frequently goes out
early in the morning, and &s;tays abroad till
night. The increa&s;e of your illne&s;s, from
the time I received the la&s;t vi&s;it from Mr.
Faulkland, to &s;uch a degree as to alarm us
for your life, I &s;uppo&s;e, prevented your
brother from rea&s;&s;uming the &s;ubject; tho'
I can perceive he is full of anger and vexa|tion
on the occa&s;ion. You are now, my
dear, God be prai&s;ed, in a hopeful way of
recovery, and I expect that George (who
has, by e&s;pou&s;ing this man's intere&s;ts &s;o
warmly, very much offended me,) that
George, I &s;ay, will renew his &s;ollicitations
in his favour. What do you &s;ay, my child?
I &s;hould be glad to know your thoughts,
with regard to the part I have acted, as well
as with re&s;pect to Mr. Faulkland's conduct.</P>
<P>Shall I own my weakne&s;s to you, my dear
Cecilia? I was ready to melt into tears; my
&s;pirits, exhau&s;ted by &s;ickne&s;s, were not proof
again&s;t this unexpected blow; a heavy &s;igh
bur&s;t from my heart, that gave me a little
relief. You know my mother is rigid in her
notions of virtue; and I was determined to
&s;hew her that I would endeavour to imitate
<PB N="80" REF="82">
her. I therefore &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the &s;welling
pa&s;&s;ion in my brea&s;t, and with as much com|po&s;ure
as I could a&s;&s;ume, told her, I thought
&s;he acted as became her; and that, with re|gard
to Mr. Faulkland, my opinion of his
conduct was &s;uch, that I never de&s;ired to &s;ee
him more. This an&s;wer, dictated perhaps
by female pride (for I will not an&s;wer for
the feelings of my heart at that in&s;tant)
was &s;o agreeable to my mother, that &s;he
threw her arms about my neck, and ki&s;&s;ed
me &s;everal times; ble&s;&s;ing, and calling me
by the mo&s;t endearing names at every inter|val.
Her tenderne&s;s overcame me; or, to
deal with &s;incerity, I believe I was willing to
make it an excu&s;e for weeping. Oh! my
dear mother, cry'd I, I have need of your
indulgence; but indeed your goodne&s;s quite
over-powers me. My dear love, &s;aid &s;he,
you de&s;erve it all, and more than it is in your
mother's power to &s;hew you. What a
ble&s;&s;ed e&s;cape have you had, my &s;weet child,
of that wild man! Little did I think, my
Sidney, when I told you the &s;tory of my
fir&s;t di&s;appointment, that a ca&s;e &s;o parallel
would &s;oon be your own. With re&s;pect to
you and me indeed, the incidents are nearly
alike; but there is a wide difference between
the two men. My lover had the grace to
repent, and would have returned to his fir&s;t
engagements, if a dreadful malady had not
<PB N="81" REF="83">
overtaken him; but this gracele&s;s Faulkland
per&s;i&s;ts in his infidelity, and would make
you as culpable as him&s;elf. I own to you,
daughter, that the recollection of that me|lancholy
event which happened to me,
has given me a &s;ort of horror at the
very thoughts of an union between you and
Mr. Faulkland. You remember the &s;ad
con&s;equences which I related to you of an
infidelity of this kind; the poor for&s;aken
woman died of grief, and the di&s;hone&s;t lo|ver
ran mad. Think of this, my child, and
let it encourage you to bani&s;h &s;uch an un|worthy
man from your heart. I was afraid
your regard for him might make this a dif|ficult
ta&s;k; but I rejoice to find your virtue
is &s;tronger than your pa&s;&s;ion. <HI>I</HI> loved
as well as you, but I overcame it when
I found it a duty to do &s;o; and I &s;ee your
mother's example is not lo&s;t upon you.</P>
<P>The hone&s;t pride that my mother endea|voured
to in&s;pire me with, had a good effect,
and kept up my &s;pirits for a time. She told
me, &s;he was &s;ure that Sir George would
quarrel with us both, when we came to talk
upon the &s;ubject of the marriage; but &s;he
was entirely ea&s;y as to that, now &s;he knew
that my &s;entiments corre&s;ponded with her
own.</P>
<P>You know my mother has ever been de|&s;potic
in her government of me; and had I
<PB N="82" REF="84">
even been inclined to di&s;&s;ent from her judge|ment
in a matter of this importance, it
would have been to no purpo&s;e; but this
was really far from my thoughts.</P>
<P>I was as much di&s;gu&s;ted with Mr. Faulk|land
as &s;he was, and as heartily pitied the
unhappy young creature whom he had un|done.</P>
<P>You may recollect, my dear, that my
mother, though &s;trictly nice in every parti|cular,
has a &s;ort of partiality to her own &s;ex,
and where there is the lea&s;t room for it,
throws the whole of the blame upon the
<HI>man</HI>'s &s;ide; who, from her own early pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions,
&s;he is always inclined to think
are deceivers of women. I am not &s;urprized
at this bias in her; her early di&s;appointment,
with the attending circum&s;tances, gave her
this impre&s;&s;ion. She is warm, and &s;ome|times
<HI>&s;udden,</HI> in her attachments; and yet it
is not always difficult to turn her from them.
The integrity of her own heart makes her
liable to be impo&s;ed on by a plau&s;ible out|&s;ide;
and yet the dear good woman takes a
&s;ort of pride in her &s;agacity. She had ad|mired
and e&s;teemed Mr. Faulkland prodi|giou&s;ly;
her vexation was the greater, in
finding her expectations di&s;appointed; and
could I have been &s;o unju&s;t to the preten&s;i|ons
of another, or &s;o indelicate in regard to
my&s;elf, as to have overlooked Mr. Faulk|land's
<PB N="83" REF="85">
fault, I knew my mother would be
inflexible. I therefore re&s;olved in earne&s;t to
bani&s;h him from my thoughts. I found my
mother was mightily plea&s;ed with her own
management of the conver&s;ation &s;he had
held with Mr. Faulkland. I think I talked
pretty <HI>roundly</HI> to him, &s;aid &s;he; but there
was no other way; he is an artful man, and I
was re&s;olved not to let him wind me about.
He would make a merit of having <HI>formed
no de&s;igns</HI> upon the young lady; why, po&s;|&s;ibly,
he did not, till he found the poor &s;oul
was &s;o &s;mitten with him, that he thought &s;he
would be an ea&s;y prey. Sir George impu|dently
in&s;inuated, that a man <HI>mu&s;t</HI> not reject
a lady upon the&s;e occa&s;ions. I was a&s;hamed
to hint to Mr. Faulkland at the circum&s;tance
of his having actually paid a price for the
girl; it was too gro&s;s; and I think, had I
mentioned it, mu&s;t have &s;truck him dumb:
though very likely he might have had &s;ome
&s;ubterfuge, even for that aggravating part of
the &s;tory.</P>
<P>How I am &s;hocked, my Cecilia, to think
of this! I was glad my mother had &s;pared
his confu&s;ion on this particular; for though
probably, as &s;he ob&s;erved, he had come
prepared with &s;ome eva&s;ion to this charge,
yet what a mean figure mu&s;t a man make,
who is reduced to di&s;ingenuous &s;hifts, to ex|cu&s;e
<PB N="84" REF="86">
or palliate an action, de&s;picable as well
as wicked!</P>
<P>My brother came in, during our di&s;cour&s;e,
to a&s;k me how I did. My mother an&s;wered
his que&s;tion before I had time to &s;peak. She
is pretty well, thank God! and not likely
to break her heart, though &s;he <HI>knows</HI> your
friend Mr. Faulkland's &s;tory (and &s;he &s;poke it
&s;cornfully.) My brother &s;aid, Sidney, are <HI>you</HI>
as aver&s;e to Mr. Faulkland as my mother is?
I replied, brother, I wonder you can a&s;k me
that que&s;tion, after what you have been ju&s;t
now told. I always &s;aid, an&s;wered he, that you
did not know the value of the man, and
now I am convinced of it. I wi&s;h he had
never &s;een you! I wi&s;h &s;o too, &s;aid I. Sir
George walked about the room, and &s;eemed
vexed to death. For Heaven's &s;ake, madam,
(turning to my mother) now my &s;i&s;ter is to|lerably
recovered, &s;uffer her to &s;ee Mr.
Faulkland; let her hear what he has to &s;ay
in his own vindication: I think you may tru&s;t
to her honour, and her di&s;cretion; and if the
affair appears to her in &s;o heinous a light as
it does to you, I will be contented to give
Mr. Faulkland up; but don't &s;hut your own
ears, and your daughter's too, again&s;t con|viction.</P>
<P>Sir, you are di&s;re&s;pectful, &s;aid my mo|ther
angrily. Dear brother, I cried, I beg
you will &s;pare me on this &s;ubject; my mo|ther
<PB N="85" REF="87">
<HI>has</HI> given me leave to judge for my|&s;elf;
&s;he has repeated all that you have
&s;aid, and all that Mr. Faulkland has been
able to urge on the occa&s;ion; and I am
&s;orry to tell you, that I think my&s;elf bound
never to have any farther corre&s;pondence
with him; therefore you mu&s;t excu&s;e me
for not &s;eeing him. And &s;o the match is
broke off, cried Sir George. <HI>It is,</HI> &s;aid my
mother peremptorily. It is, ecchoed I faintly.
Why then, replied Sir George (and he &s;wore),
you will never get &s;uch another whil&s;t you
live. A pretty figure you'll make in the
world, when you give it for a rea&s;on that
you refu&s;ed <HI>&s;uch</HI> a man, after every thing
was concluded upon, becau&s;e truly you found
that he had had an intrigue! Why, Sidney,
you'll be &s;o laugh'd at! He addre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf
to me, though I knew he meant the re|proof
for my mother. Sir, an&s;wered &s;he,
neither your &s;i&s;ter nor I &s;hall trouble our|&s;elves
much about the opinion of people
who <HI>can</HI> laugh at &s;uch things. You may
put the matter into as ridiculous a light as
you plea&s;e: but this was no common in|trigue;
you <HI>know</HI> it was not, however you
may affect to &s;peak of it. I don't &s;uppo&s;e
<HI>any</HI> of you are <HI>Saints,</HI> but I tru&s;t in Hea|ven,
&s;ome are better than others. Oh! ma|dam,
madam, &s;aid my brother, if you knew
the world as well as <HI>I</HI> do, you would think
<PB N="86" REF="88">
that Mr. Faulkland is one of the be&s;t. God
forbid! my mother an&s;wered coolly. Well,
well, madam, cry'd Sir George, I &s;ee it is
to no purpo&s;e to argue; there are many fa|milies
of more con&s;equence than ours, and
ten times the fortune, that will be very
proud of Faulkland's alliance; and will
hardly make it an objection to him, that he
was led into a fooli&s;h &s;crape by the wickedne&s;s
of one woman, and the folly of another.
If you make my &s;i&s;ter wait for a hu&s;band,
till you find a man who never offended in
that way, I think, mother, you had better
take a little boy from his nur&s;e, breed him
up under your own eye, and by the time
Sidney is a good motherly gentlewoman,
you may give her the baby to make a play|thing
of. For my own part, I am heartily
&s;orry I ever interfered.&mdash;People of &s;uch nice
&s;cruples had better chu&s;e for them&s;elves;
but I cannot help thinking, that both Faulk|land
and I are very ill u&s;ed. I told you (&s;aid
my mother to me) how he would behave.
Sir George, I de&s;ire you will not di&s;tre&s;s
your &s;i&s;ter thus (&s;he &s;aw me &s;adly ca&s;t down:
I was ill and weak:) if you have no re&s;pect
for <HI>me,</HI> have a little tenderne&s;s for her.&mdash;I
beg your pardon, child, &s;aid he, I did not
mean to di&s;tre&s;s you, I pity <HI>you,</HI> indeed, Sid|ney.
I could have cry'd at his u&s;ing that
expre&s;&s;ion, it humbles one &s;o. Madam (to
<PB N="87" REF="89">
my mother,) you &s;hall be troubled no farther
by my friend or my&s;elf; all I &s;hall &s;ay, is
this, that whenever my &s;i&s;ter gets a hu&s;band
of your lady&s;hip's chu&s;ing, I wi&s;h he may
have half the worth of the poor rejected
Faulkland.</P>
<P>My brother left the room with the&s;e
words. My mother was downright in a
pa&s;&s;ion, but &s;oon cooled on his withdrawing.</P>
<P>My &s;pirits were quite fatigued; and my
mother left me, that I might take a little re&s;t.</P>
<P>What a &s;trange alteration have a few days
produced! our dome&s;tic peace broke in up|on
by the unlucky difference between my
mother and my brother. My near pro&s;pect
of&mdash;of&mdash;oh! let me be ingenuous,
and &s;ay Happine&s;s, vani&s;hed&mdash;Poor Mr.
Faulkland! <HI>Poor</HI> do I call him? for &s;hame,
Sidney&mdash;but let the word go; I will not
blot it Mr. Faulkland forbid the hou&s;e,
my&s;elf harra&s;&s;ed by a cruel di&s;order, and
hardly able to crawl out of bed. All this
has fallen on me within the&s;e la&s;t fourteen
black days. Then I dread the going abroad,
or &s;eeing company, I &s;hall look &s;o &s;illy;
for the intended wedding began to be talk|ed
of;&mdash;and the curio&s;ity of people to
know the cau&s;e of it's being broke off&mdash;
What wild gue&s;&s;es will be made by &s;ome,
and what lies invented by others! Then the
ill-natured mirth of one half of the girls of
<PB N="88" REF="90">
my acquaintance, and the <HI>as</HI> provoking con|dolements
of the other half&mdash;I am fretted
at the thoughts of it&mdash;but it cannot be
I mu&s;t bear it all&mdash;I wi&s;h I were helped;
enough to get into the country, to be well
out of the reach of &s;uch impertinence.</P>
<P>I long to know&punc; who this ill-fated&punc; girl is,
that has been the cau&s;e of all this. <HI>A gen|tlewoman,
and very pretty; one that loves
Mr. Faulkland, and will &s;hortly make him a
parent.</HI> Thus my mother de&s;cribed her to
Mr. Faulkland, and he a&s;&s;ented to it. Oh!
fie, fie, Mr. Faulkland, how could you be
&s;o cruel to <HI>her?</HI> How could you u&s;e me &s;o
ill? and Sir George knew of all this, and
makes light of it! it is a &s;trange &s;tory! My
mother is &s;evere in her virtue, but &s;he is in
the right&mdash;My brother would &s;acrifice every
con&s;ideration to aggrandize his family&mdash;To
make a purcha&s;e of the unhappy creature,
and that without her knowledge too, it is
horrid! A way, away from my thoughts,
thou vile intruder&mdash;Return to your Bath mi|&s;tre&s;s,
&s;he has a better right to you than I
have; &s;he implores your pity; &s;he has no
refuge but you; and &s;he may be every way
preferable to me&mdash;I wi&s;h I knew her name,
but what is it to me; <HI>mine</HI> will never be
Faulkland, <HI>hers</HI> ought. Perhaps Mr Faulk|land
may be induced to marry her, when
he &s;ees her in her pre&s;ent intere&s;ting &s;ituati|on.
He &s;ays he will provide a retreat for
<PB N="89" REF="91">
her; to be &s;ure he will have the compa&s;&s;ion
to vi&s;it her: and then who knows what
may happen? If I know my own heart,
I think I do mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;h he may
make her his wife; but then I would not
chu&s;e to have it known &s;uddenly; that
might look as if he for&s;ook me for her.
<HI>That,</HI> I own, would a little hurt my pride.
I wi&s;h not the truth to be known, for Mr.
Faulkland's &s;ake; but then I &s;hould not
like to have a &s;lur thrown on me.</P>
<P>I will add no more to this, but &s;end the
packet off at all events; I think it will find
you at Paris.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1.&mdash;My health promi&s;es to
return: my mother prai&s;es me, and calls
me a Heroine. I begin to fancy my&s;elf
one: our pride &s;ometimes &s;tands in the
place of virtue.</P>
<P>Sir George went to Richmond ye&s;terday.
We have &s;carce &s;een him &s;ince the tift he
had with us the other day. What &s;trange
creatures the&s;e men are, even the be&s;t of
them! and how light they make of faults
in one another, that &s;hock us but to think
of!</P>
<P>My mother takes his behaviour very ill:
he &s;taid all night with his friend, and return|ed
to town this morning: he only looked
into my room, to a&s;k me how I did: my
mother was &s;itting with me. I believe that
hindered him from coming in; for he look|ed
<PB N="90" REF="92">
as if he wanted to &s;peak to me. He
bowed to my mother, but &s;aid not a word;
he went abroad again as &s;oon as he was dre&s;&s;|ed,
and did not come in till late. I fear his
conduct will oblige us to &s;eparate; for my
mother will not brook any liberties to be
taken with her: &s;he hinted as much, and &s;aid
&s;he believed Sir George was tired of living
regularly.</P>
<P>She anticipated the reque&s;t I intended to
make to her, of letting me go out of town;
for &s;he &s;aid, as &s;oon as I was able, I &s;hould
remove into the country for a while. Sidney-Ca&s;tle
is too long a Journey for me at pre&s;ent
to think of undertaking, and &s;he talks of
going into E&s;&s;ex, on a vi&s;it to Lady Grim|&s;ton,
which we have long promi&s;ed her. I
&s;hall like this better than going down to
Wilt&s;hire, where the want of my Cecilia
would make my old abode a melancholy
place, e&s;pecially at this juncture.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 4.&mdash;Sir George continues &s;ullen
and cold to us: he never has had an oppor|tunity
of &s;aying any thing particular to me
&s;ince the day he &s;aid &s;o much. My mother
&s;carce ever leaves me; he &s;eems nettled at
this. I believe he would endeavour to work
on <HI>me,</HI> as he knows the attempt would be
vain in regard to <HI>her.</HI> As I am now well
enough to receive the vi&s;its of our intimate
acquaintance, I am never without company.
I am really in pretty good &s;pirits, and bear
<PB N="91" REF="93">
my di&s;appointment (as I told you I would)
very hand&s;omely. I never hear Mr. Faulk|land's
name mentioned, no more than if &s;uch
a man did not exi&s;t. We are to &s;et out for
lady Grim&s;ton's hou&s;e on Tue&s;day; it is but
twenty Miles from London; and I am al|ready
&s;trong enough to bear a longer jour|ney.</P>
<P>My mother told Sir George, that if he
liked it, the hou&s;e we are now in was at his
&s;ervice during her time of it, of which there
are &s;ome months to come; for &s;he &s;aid
&s;he meant to go directly home from
E&s;&s;ex. Sir George thanked her, but did not
&s;ay whether he would accept of her offer or
not.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 5.&mdash;I have been obliged to turn
away my poor Ellen. She was &s;o imprudent
as to receive a letter for me from Mr. Faulk|land's
man, contrary to my mother's expre&s;s
commands. She brought it to me, and I
gave it to my mother unopened, who put it
directly into the fire without reading it, and
told me it would oblige her, if I would part
with the &s;ervant who had pre&s;umed to take
it after her prohibition. I in&s;tantly obeyed,
and have ju&s;t di&s;charged her. I &s;hould have
a &s;ad lo&s;s of her, only I am in hopes of
having her place well &s;upplied by an old ac|quaintance
and play-fellow of ours, poor
Patty Main; her father is dead, and &s;he is
obliged to go to &s;ervice, for he has left a
<PB N="92" REF="94">
widow with &s;ix children. The elde&s;t &s;on,
you remember, &s;erved his time to his father,
and is ju&s;t now &s;etting out in bu&s;ine&s;s; but a
young &s;urgeon in a country town mu&s;t take
&s;ome time to e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf; though he is
a very worthy youth, and I hear clever in
his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Patty came to town la&s;t week with a lady
from our neighbourhood, who applied to
my mother to recommend the girl to wait on
&s;ome per&s;on of fa&s;hion. My mother has
been looking out for a &s;uitable place for her;
but &s;he told me to-day, &s;he thought I could
not do better than take her to my&s;elf; I
&s;hall be very glad to have her, for &s;he is an
amiable young woman.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 6.&mdash;We go out of town at &s;even
o'clock to-morrow morning, as we are to
dine at Grim&s;ton-hall, and purpo&s;e going at
our lei&s;ure. I will &s;teal a few minutes from
&s;leep, though it is now very late, to give
you a &s;hort &s;cene which pa&s;&s;ed in my cham|ber
about an hour ago.</P>
<P>Sir George (who, according to his late
cu&s;tom, had been abroad all day) came into
my room, where my mother and I were &s;it|ting
together. He a&s;ked us, did we hold
our purpo&s;e of going out of town next day?
Yes, certainly, my mother &s;aid. And you
intend going from lady Grim&s;ton's to Sidney-Ca&s;tle?
We do. Then, madam (to my
mother), as it is the la&s;t trouble you are like|ly
<PB N="93" REF="95">
to have from Mr. Faulkland, I hope you
will not refu&s;e to read this letter, which he
has &s;ent you; and he took one out of his
pocket, and pre&s;ented it to her. She did
not make an offer to receive it, but an&s;wered,
Sir George, it is to no purpo&s;e for Mr.
Faulkland to &s;ollicit me; you know I don't
ea&s;ily alter my re&s;olutions when once they are
fixed: he has given him&s;elf an unnece&s;&s;ary
trouble; pray excu&s;e me: it was not hand|&s;ome
of him to write to my daughter, after
he knew my &s;entiments. You need not be
afraid of fre&s;h &s;ollicitations, madam, &s;aid my
brother; I knew enough of your <HI>firmne&s;s</HI>
(and he &s;poke the word firmne&s;s reluctantly,
as if he would rather u&s;e another, perhaps
le&s;s re&s;pectful term;) I knew enough to a&s;|&s;ure
Faulkland there was not the lea&s;t hope
left for him; and though I do not know the
&s;ubject of that letter, I can venture to a&s;&s;ure
you, it is not intended to move you in fa|vour
of his preten&s;ions: this he declared to
me, before I would take the letter from him;
but what puts it pa&s;t doubt, is, that he &s;et
out this very evening from London, in order
to embark for Germany. I could not help
breathing a &s;igh when Sir George &s;aid this;
but no body heard me. He &s;till held the let-letter
in his hand, and again offered it to my
mother; you need not be afraid of it, madam;
I pre&s;ume it may be no more than to take a
<PB N="94" REF="96">
civil leave of you. I wi&s;h him well, &s;aid
my mother, taking the letter; if that be all,
what he &s;ays may keep cold; and &s;he put it
into her pocket without opening.</P>
<P>This being the eve of our journey, &s;ome
little dome&s;tick matters, which my mother
had to &s;ettle, called her out of the room.
Sir George took that opportunity to a&s;k me,
whether my mother had &s;hewed me the let|ter
which he had received from Mr. Faulk|land
while he was at Bath, relative to that
cur&s;ed affair, as he called it. I told him, my
mother had repeated great part of the con|tents
of it to me; and that the principal ob|&s;ervation
&s;he had made, was not favourable
to <HI>him,</HI> on account of his being made the
confidant of &s;uch an affair.</P>
<P>I am very &s;orry for your &s;ake, Sidney,
&s;aid he, that our mother is of &s;o inflexible a
temper; you have lo&s;t by it, what you will
have rea&s;on to regret as long as you live.
Such amazing ob&s;tinacy! &s;uch unaccountable
perver&s;ene&s;s! I do not want to &s;hake your
filial obedience; but I, for my own part,
think that nothing but infatuation can ac|count
for your mother's conduct&mdash;Does
&s;he want a man without pa&s;&s;ions? Or have
<HI>you</HI> filled your head with &s;uch chimaerical
notions as to&mdash;I interrupted him (for my
brother is not always nice in his choice of
words;)&mdash;Dear Sir George, &s;ay no more;
<PB N="95" REF="97">
I am very well eontented as I am. I will
not increa&s;e your unea&s;ine&s;s, &s;aid he, by tell|ing
you what Faulkland has &s;uffered on this
occa&s;ion. If ever love was carried to ado|ration,
it was in the brea&s;t of that generous,
charming fellow&mdash;but you have lo&s;t him&mdash;and
I have lo&s;t him; thanks to my wi&s;e
&s;crupulous mother for that. I begged of
him to drop the &s;ubject. My mother came
in to us again. Sir George bid us good night,
and wi&s;hed us a good journey. The part|ing
was cool enough. I am glad how|ever,
there is not a total rupture. I believe
he will continue in our hou&s;e in town for a
time, at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>Patty Main, who gladly accepted of the
offer of my &s;ervice, came home to me this
evening. She is grown very tall and genteel.
I hardly know how to treat her as a &s;ervant;
but the good girl is &s;o humble, that &s;he
does all in her power to make me forget that
I ever knew her in a better &s;ituation; but in
this &s;he fails of her purpo&s;e, for it only
&s;erves to remind me the more &s;trongly of
it: &s;he is &s;o ready and &s;o handy, that &s;he
does twenty little offices that do not belong
to her place, and which are not expected of
her. My mother is exceedingly plea&s;ed
with her, and &s;ays it is &s;uch a happine&s;s to
have about me a young per&s;on virtuou&s;ly
<PB N="96" REF="98">
brought up, that &s;he almo&s;t con&s;iders her as
one of the family.</P>
<P><HI>Grim&s;ton-hall, Augu&s;t</HI> 8.</P>
<P>We arrived here ye&s;terday, and met a
mo&s;t friendly reception from the lady of this
man&s;ion. But before I &s;ay any more of her,
I will ha&s;ten to a more intere&s;ting &s;ubject.
I have got Mr. Faulkland's letter to my mo|ther;
&s;he has ju&s;t put it into my hands; and
while &s;he walks in the garden with lady
Grim&s;ton, I will made ha&s;te to tran&s;cribe it.
Thus it is:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I &s;ubmit to the &s;entence you have pa&s;&s;ed
on me. I am mi&s;erable, but do not pre&s;ume to
expo&s;tulate. I purpo&s;e leaving England di|rectly;
but would wi&s;h, if po&s;&s;ible (a little
to mitigate the &s;everity of my lot,) to con|vince
you, that the unhappy rejected Man,
who a&s;pired to the honour of being your
&s;on-in-law, is not quite &s;uch a criminal as he
now appears to you.</P>
<P>To Sir George's friend&s;hip I know I am
much indebted for endeavouring to vindi|cate
me. It was not in his power, it was
not in my own; for you &s;aw all which I, in
unre&s;erved freedom, wrote to him on the
&s;ubject of my acquaintance with Mi&s;s B.</P>
<P>I have but one re&s;ource left; perhaps,
madam, you will think it a &s;trange one.
To the lady her&s;elf I mu&s;t appeal. She
<PB N="97" REF="99">
will do me ju&s;tice, and I am &s;ure will be
ready to acknowledge that I am no betrayer
of innocence, no breaker of promi&s;es; that
I was &s;urprized into the commi&s;&s;ion of a
fault, for which I have &s;o dear a price.</P>
<P>Her te&s;timony, madam, may perhaps
have &s;ome weight with you; though I pro|po&s;e
nothing more by it, than that you may
think of me with le&s;s dete&s;tation. You have
bani&s;hed me from your pre&s;ence: I'am a
voluntary exile from my country, and from
my friends: I &s;ubmit to the cha&s;ti&s;ement,
and would do any thing to expiate my of|fence
again&s;t you and Mi&s;s Bidulph. There
is but <HI>one</HI> command which you can po&s;&s;ibly
lay on me, to which I would not pay a per|fect
and ready obedience; but that act, per|haps,
is the only one which would make me
appear worthy of your e&s;teem.</P>
<P>The lady whom it has been my ill fate to
render unhappy, and by whom I am made
unutterably &s;o, will, ere long, come to a
hou&s;e at Putney, which I have taken on
purpo&s;e for her. I have placed in it my
hou&s;ekeeper, a grave worthy woman, under
who&s;e care &s;he will be &s;afe, and attended
with that &s;ecrecy and tenderne&s;s which her
condition requires.</P>
<P>I have written to her a faithful account of
every thing relative to my hoped-for alliance
with your family, and the occa&s;ion of the
<PB N="98" REF="100">
treaty's being broken off. As &s;he mu&s;t, by
this means, know that your lady&s;hip is ac|quainted
with her &s;tory, I have told her,
that, perhaps you might, from the intere&s;t
you took in her misfortune, be induced to
&s;ee her in her retirement. Let me, therefore,
conjure you, madam, by the pious zeal which
governs all your actions, and by the love
you bear that daughter &s;o de&s;ervedly dear to
you, to take compa&s;&s;ion on this young lady.
She has no friends, nor any acquaintance in
this part of the kingdom; her &s;ituation will
require the comfort of &s;ociety, and perhaps,
the advice of wi&s;dom. It will be an act
worthy of your humanity to &s;hew &s;ome
countenance to her.</P>
<P>I think &s;he will be in very good hands
with the hone&s;t woman who waits her come|ing;
but if any thing &s;hould happen other|wi&s;e
than well, it would make me doubly
wretched.</P>
<P>To one who has no re&s;ources of content|ment
in her own bo&s;om, &s;olitude cannot be
a friend; this I fear may be the lady's ca&s;e;
and this makes me with the more earne&s;tne&s;s
urge my reque&s;t to you. Forgive me, ma|dam,
for the liberty I take with you; a li|berty,
which, though I confe&s;s, it needs an
apology, yet is it at the &s;ame time a proof of
$he confidence I have in you, which I hope
<PB N="99" REF="101">
will not affront either your candour or your
virtue.</P>
<P>If you will conde&s;cend to grant this re|que&s;t,
I &s;hall obtain the two wi&s;hes at pre&s;ent
mo&s;t material to my peace; the one to &s;e|cure
to the lady a compa&s;&s;ionate friend, al|ready
inclined to e&s;pou&s;e her cau&s;e; the other,
to put it in your power to be &s;atisfied from
the lady's own mouth, of the truth of what
I have a&s;&s;erted. I tru&s;t to her genero&s;ity to
deal openly on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h you and Mi&s;s Bidulph every ble&s;&s;|ing
that Heaven can be&s;tow, and am, with
great re&s;pect,</P>
<CLOSER>Madam,
Your lady&s;hip's
Mo&s;t obedient, humble Servant,
<SIGNED>ORLANDO FAULKLAND.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>P. S. The lady will go by the name of
Mrs. Jefferis: you will pardon me for not
having mentioned her <HI>real name.</HI> I never
yet told it even to Sir George; but I pre&s;ume
&s;he will make no &s;ecret of it to you, if you
honour her with a vi&s;it.</P>
<P>Poor Orlando! unhappy Mi&s;s B! I could
name a third per&s;on, that is not <HI>happy</HI> nei|ther.
What a pity it is, that &s;o many good
qualities, &s;hould be blotted by imperfections!
how tender is his compa&s;&s;ion for this poor
girl! how ingenuous his conduct! but &s;till
he flies from her. I fear &s;he can never hope
<PB N="100" REF="102">
to recover him. There is but <HI>one</HI> thing, he
&s;ays, which <HI>he would not do; the only act,
perhaps, by which he could make him&s;elf appear
worthy of my mother's e&s;teem.</HI> The meaning
of this but too plainly &s;hews him determined
again&s;t marrying Mi&s;s B. I don't know
any thing el&s;e which would reconcile my
mother to him.</P>
<P>I make no doubt of her complying with
Mr. Faulkland's reque&s;t in &s;eeing the lady:
&s;he is very compa&s;&s;ionate, particularly to her
own &s;ex.</P>
<P>What a <HI>&s;trange re&s;ource</HI> indeed is this of
Mr. Faulkland's, to appeal to the lady her|&s;elf!
what am I to judge from it, but that the
unfortunate victim, ignorant of the treachery
that was practi&s;ed again&s;t her by her wicked
aunt, and that her de&s;troyer paid a <HI>price</HI> for
her di&s;honour, exculpates him from the wor&s;t
part of the guilt, and perhaps, poor ea&s;y
creature, blames her own weakne&s;s only for
the error which a concealed train of cunning
and perfidy might have led her into?</P>
<P>But even &s;uppo&s;ing Mi&s;s B. were gene|rous
and candid enough (and great indeed
mu&s;t be her candour and genero&s;ity) to ju&s;ti|fy
this guilty man, what would it avail?
Did not my mother tell me &s;he conceived a
<HI>&s;ort of horror at the bare idea of an union be|tween
Mr. Faulkland and me?</HI> This ari&s;es
from the &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion made on her by
<PB N="101" REF="103">
the unlucky event which bla&s;ted her own early
love. Strong and early prejudices are almo&s;t
in&s;urmountable.</P>
<P>My mother's piety, genuine and rational
as it is, is notwith&s;tanding a little tinctured
with &s;uper&s;tition; it was the error of her
education, and her good &s;en&s;e has not been
able to &s;urmount it; &s;o that I know the uni|ver&s;e
would not induce her to change her re|&s;olution
in regard to Mr. Faulkland. She
thinks he <HI>ought</HI> to marry Mi&s;s B, and &s;he
will <HI>ever</HI> think &s;o. I wi&s;h he would; for I
am &s;ure he never can be mine. The bell
rings for breakfa&s;t; I mu&s;t run down. My
mother came up to dre&s;s ju&s;t now, and &s;tep|ped
into my room. I returned her the let|ter,
and &s;he a&s;ked me, what I thought of
Mr. Faulkland's reque&s;t? Madam, you are
a better judge of the propriety of it than I
am. I &s;hall have no objection to &s;eeing the
unhappy lady, &s;aid &s;he, &s;ince it &s;eems he has
appri&s;ed her of my knowledge of her affairs.
I am glad he has the grace to &s;hew even &s;o
much compa&s;&s;ion for her: perhaps it may
be the beginning of repentance, and time
may work a thorough reformation in him, if
God &s;pares him his life and his <HI>&s;en&s;es.</HI> You
&s;ee which way my good mother's thoughts
tended. I did not, &s;he added, intend to re|turn
to London again; but this occa&s;ion, I
think, calls upon me; and I believe I &s;hall
<PB N="102" REF="104">
go for a while, in order to &s;ee and comfort
this poor young creature. She cannot yet
be near lying in; and I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he will not
come to the hou&s;e Mr. Faulkland &s;peaks of,
'till &s;he can no longer remain undi&s;covered
at home; &s;o that a month or two hence will
be full &s;oon enough for me to think of going
to town.</P>
<P>I &s;aw my mother re&s;ted her compliance
with Mr. Faulkland's reque&s;t, merely on
one point; that of compa&s;&s;ion to the girl.
As for the other motive, &s;aid &s;he, the hear|ing
him ju&s;tified from the <HI>Lady's own mouth,</HI>
I am not &s;uch a novice in tho&s;e matters, but
that I know when a deluding man has once
got an a&s;cendency over a young creature, he
can coax her into any thing. Too much truth
I doubt there is in this ob&s;ervation of my
mother's.</P>
<P>But it is time to &s;ay &s;omething of lady
Grim&s;ton. My Cecilia has never &s;een her,
though I believe &s;he has often heard my mo|ther
&s;peak of her. They are nearly of an
age, and much of the &s;ame ca&s;t of thinking;
though with this difference, that lady Grim|&s;ton
is extravagantly rigid in her notions, and
preci&s;e in her manner. She has been a wi|dow
for many years, and lives upon a large
jointure at Grim&s;ton-hall, with as much re|gularity
and &s;olemnity, as you would &s;ee in a
mona&s;tery. Her &s;ervants are all antediluvi|ans;
<PB N="103" REF="105">
I believe her coach-hor&s;es are fifty
years of age, and the very hou&s;e-dog is as
grey as a badger. She her&s;elf, who in her
youth never <HI>could</HI> have been hand&s;ome, ren|ders
her&s;elf &s;till a more unplea&s;ing figure, by
the oddity of her dre&s;s; you would take
her for a lady of Charles the fir&s;t's court at
lea&s;t. She is always dre&s;&s;ed out: I believe
&s;he &s;leeps in her cloaths, for &s;he comes down
ruffled, and towered, and flounced, and
fardingaled, even to breakfa&s;t. My mother
has a very high opinion of her, and &s;ays,
&s;he <HI>knows more of the world</HI> than any one of
her acquaintance. It may be &s;o; but it
mu&s;t be of the old world; for lady Grim|&s;ton
has not been ten miles from her &s;eat the&s;e
thirty years. 'Tis nine years &s;ince my mo|ther
and &s;he met before, and there was a
world of compliments pa&s;&s;ed between them;
though I am &s;ure they were &s;incerely glad to
&s;ee each other, for they &s;eem to be very fond.
They were companions in youth, that &s;ea|&s;on
wherein the mo&s;t durable friend&s;hips are
contracted. I believe her really a very good
woman; &s;he is pious and charitable, and
does abundance of good things in her neigh|bourhood;
though I cannot &s;ay, I think
her amiable. There is an au&s;terity about her
that keeps me in awe, notwith&s;tanding that
&s;he is extremely obliging to me, and told my
mother, I <HI>promi&s;ed to make a fine woman.</HI>
<PB N="104" REF="106">
Think of &s;uch a compliment to one of al|mo&s;t
nineteen. My mother and &s;he call
one another by their chri&s;tian names; and
you would &s;mile to hear the two old ladies
(begging their pardons). <HI>Lettying</HI> and
<HI>Dollying</HI> one another. This accounts to me
for Lady Grim&s;ton's think <HI>me</HI> &s;till a child;
for I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he con&s;iders her&s;elf not much
pa&s;t girlhood, though, to do her ju&s;tice, &s;he
has not a &s;crap of it in her behaviour.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 10.&mdash;All our motions here are
as regular as the clock. The family ri&s;e at
&s;ix; we are &s;ummoned to breakfa&s;t at eight;
at ten a venerable congregation are a&s;&s;embled
to prayers, which an antient clergyman,
who is curate of the pari&s;h, and her lady|&s;hip's
chaplain, gives us daily. Then the
old hor&s;es are put to the old coach; and
my lady, with her gue&s;ts, if they chu&s;e it,
take an airing; always going and returning
by the &s;ame road, and driving preci&s;ely to
the &s;ame land-mark, and no farther. At
half an hour after twelve, in a hall large
enough to entertain a corporation, we &s;it
down to dinner; my lady has a grace of a
quarter of an hour long, and we are waited
on by four truly venerable footmen, for &s;he
likes &s;tate. The afternoon we may di&s;po&s;e
of as we plea&s;e; at lea&s;t it is a liberty I am
indulged in, and I generally &s;pend my time
<PB N="105" REF="107">
in the garden, or my own chamber, 'till I
have notice given me of &s;upper's being on
the table, where we are treated with the
&s;ame ceremonials as at dinner. At ten ex|actly,
the in&s;tant the clock &s;trikes the fir&s;t
&s;troke, my lady ri&s;es with great &s;olemnity,
and wi&s;hes us a good night.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 14.&mdash;You cannot expect, in
&s;uch a hou&s;e as this is, my dear, that I can
be furni&s;hed with materials to give you much
variety. Indeed the&s;e four la&s;t days have
been &s;o exactly the &s;ame in every particular,
excepting that the di&s;hes at dinner and &s;up|per
were changed, that I had re&s;olved to
hang up my pen 'till I quitted Grim&s;ton-hall,
or at lea&s;t re&s;ign it to Patty, and let her plod
on and tell you how the wind blew &s;uch a
day; what &s;ort of a mantua lady Grim&s;ton
had on &s;uch a day (though by the way it is al|ways
the &s;ame, always a&s;h-coloured ti&s;&s;ue);
what the great dog barked at, at &s;uch an
hour, and what the old parrot &s;aid at &s;uch a
time; the hou&s;e and the garden I have ex|hau&s;ted
my de&s;criptive faculties on already,
though they are neither of them worth de|&s;cribing;
and I was beginning to de&s;pair of
matter to furni&s;h out a quarter of an hour's
entertainment, when the &s;cene began to
brighten a little this au&s;picious day, by the
arrival of a coach full of vi&s;itors. The&s;e
<PB N="106" REF="108">
were no other than a venerable dean, who
is the mini&s;ter of our pari&s;h, his lady and
daughter, and a Mr. Arnold, a gentleman
who is a di&s;tant relation of lady Grim&s;ton's.
He has a hou&s;e in this neighbourhood, and
is ju&s;t come to an e&s;tate by the death of his
elder brother.</P>
<P>This vi&s;it has given me hopes that I may
now-and-then have a chance for &s;eeing a hu|man
face, be&s;ides the antiques of the family,
and tho&s;e which are depicted on the arras.
Though, not to di&s;parage the people, they
were all agreeable enough in their different
ways. The old dean is good humoured
and polite; I mean the true politene&s;s, that
of the heart, which dictates the mo&s;t o|bliging
things in &s;o frank a manner, that they
have not the lea&s;t appearance of flattery.
Being very near &s;ighted, he put on a pair
of &s;pectacles to look at me, and turning to
Mr. Arnold, with a vivacity that would have
become five-and-twenty, he repeated</P>
<Q><L>&startq;With an air and a face,</L>
<L>And a &s;hape and a grace, &amp;c.&endq;</L></Q>
<P>The young man &s;miled his a&s;&s;ent, and my
mother looked &s;o delighted, that the good-natured
dean's compliment plea&s;ed <HI>me</HI> for
<HI>her</HI> &s;ake. Lady Grim&s;ton, who is pa&s;&s;io|nately
fond of mu&s;ick, has a very pretty
organ in one of her chambers; Mr. Arnold
<PB N="107" REF="109">
was reque&s;ted to give us a le&s;&s;on on it,
which he very readily obliged us with. He
plays ravi&s;hingly; the creature made me
envious, he touched it &s;o admirably. I had
taken a &s;ort of di&s;like to him when he fir&s;t
came in, I cannot tell why or wherefore;
but this accompli&s;hment has reconciled me
&s;o to him, that I am half in love with him.
I hope we &s;hall &s;ee him often; he is really
excellent on this in&s;trument, and you know
how fond I am of mu&s;ick.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 15.&mdash;This packet is already &s;o
large that I am &s;ure it will frighten you. I
will therefore &s;end it off before I encrea&s;e it;
e&s;pecially as I am &s;o now much in the hum|drum
way, that I ought, out of policy, to
make a break in my narrative, in order to
encourage you to read it. Po&s;itively, if
things do not mend, and that con&s;iderably
too,&mdash;Patty &s;hall keep the Journal, for I
find my&s;elf already di&s;po&s;ed to &s;leep over it.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 20.&mdash;I have looked over what
Patty has writ for the five la&s;t days; upon my
word &s;he is a very good journali&s;t, as well as
amanuen&s;is; and &s;he has given you, to the
full, as good an account of matters and
things as I could.</P>
<P>My time pa&s;&s;es rather more tolerably than
I expected. The dean's family &s;eem to
have broke the &s;olitary <HI>&s;pell</HI> that hung over
<PB N="108" REF="110">
the hou&s;e, and we have company you &s;ee
every day. Mr. Arnold never fails. I al|ways
make him play; he is very obliging,
and, if he were not good-natured, I &s;hould
tire him.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 22.&mdash;I have had a letter from Sir Geo.
he mentions not Mr. Faulkland; I too am en|deavouring
to forget him. When my mother
goes to London, I will try to prevail on her to
let me go down to Sidney-ca&s;tle. I have no
inclination to go to town, and le&s;s to &s;tay
here. We are to have a concert to-morrow,
at Mr. Arnold's hou&s;e. My lively good
old dean touches the ba&s;s viol, his daughter
&s;ings prettily; I am to bear my part too;
&s;o that we begin to grow a little &s;ociable.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 30.&mdash;Are you not tired of my
Grim&s;ton journal, my Cecilia? Day after
day rolls on, and the &s;ame dull repetition!
Lady Grim&s;ton, the Dean, and Mr. Arnold,
perpetually! there is no bearing this, you
cry. Well but here is a new per&s;onage ar|rived
to diver&s;ify the &s;cene a little. Lady
Grim&s;ton's daughter, a &s;weet woman; but
her mother does not &s;eem fond of her. It
amazes me, for &s;he is perfectly amiable,
both in temper and per&s;on; &s;he is a widow
of about eight and twenty. Lady Grim&s;ton
appears to treat her with a di&s;tance very un|maternal;
<PB N="109" REF="111">
and the poor young woman &s;eems
&s;o humbled, that I pity her. She is come
but on a vi&s;it, and we &s;hall lo&s;e her in a
week, for which I am very &s;orry, as I have
taken a fancy to her.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 1.&mdash;Poor Mrs. Vere! that
is the name of Lady Grim&s;ton's daughter.
I can now give you the cau&s;e of her mother's
coldne&s;s to her; I had it from her&s;elf; &s;he
told me her little hi&s;tory this evening in the
garden, with a frankne&s;s that charmed me.</P>
<P>How happy you are, dear Mi&s;s Bidulph,
&s;aid &s;he! you &s;eem to be ble&s;&s;ed with one
of the tendere&s;t of parents. I am indeed,
I an&s;wered; &s;he is one of the be&s;t of mo|thers,
and the be&s;t of women. She &s;ighed,
and a tear &s;tarted into her eye; I too was
happy once, &s;aid &s;he, when my indulgent
father lived. I hope, madam, Lady Grim|&s;ton
is to you, what my good mother is to
me. She &s;hook her head: No, Mi&s;s Bi|dulph,
it mu&s;t be but too obvious to you that
&s;he is not. I &s;hould not have introduced
the &s;ubject, if the cold &s;everity of her looks
were not &s;o apparent that you mu&s;t have
taken notice of them. My mother is, un|doubtedly,
a very good woman; and you
may naturally &s;uppo&s;e, that my conduct
has been &s;uch as to de&s;erve her frowns; I
will therefore tell you my melancholy,
<PB N="110" REF="112">
though &s;hort &s;tory. It is now about twelve
years &s;ince Mr. Vere paid his addre&s;&s;es to
me. He was the elde&s;t &s;on of a gentleman
of family and fortune, who then lived in
this country. I was about &s;ixteen, and the
darling of my father; who was perhaps the
more indulgent to me, as he knew my mo|ther's
&s;everity. Mr. Vere was but two
years older than my&s;elf, and a childi&s;h court|&s;hip
had gone on for &s;ome time between us,
before it was &s;u&s;pected by any body; and
to &s;ay the truth, before I was well aware of
the con&s;equences my&s;elf. It happened, that
an elderly gentleman of a great e&s;tate, ju&s;t
at that time &s;aw and liked me, and directly
made propo&s;als to my mother, as &s;he was
well known to hold the reins of government
in her family.</P>
<P>This offer, I &s;uppo&s;e, was advantageous;
for &s;he immediately con&s;ulted my father up|on
it, or rather gave him to under&s;tand that
&s;he meant to di&s;po&s;e of her daughter in mar|riage.</P>
<P>My father, who had no objection to the
match, told her he was very well &s;atisfied,
provided I liked the gentleman; but &s;aid,
he hoped &s;he would not think of putting
any force on my inclinations. My elde&s;t
&s;i&s;ter had been married &s;ome time before by
my mother's &s;ole authority, and quite con|trary
<PB N="111" REF="113">
to her own liking; the marriage had
not turned out happily, and my father
was re&s;olved not to have me &s;acrificed in
the &s;ame way.</P>
<P>My mother told him, &s;he was &s;orry he
had &s;uch romantic notions, as to think a
girl of my age capable of having any ideas
of preference for one man more than an|other;
that &s;he took it for granted I had ne|ver
pre&s;umed to entertain a thought of any
man as yet, and &s;uppo&s;ed her precepts had
not been &s;o far thrown away upon me, as
that I could let it enter into my head that any
thing but paternal authority was to guide
me in my choice.</P>
<P>My father, from the gentlene&s;s of his na|ture,
had been &s;o accu&s;tomed to acquie&s;ce,
that he made no other reply than to bid my
mother u&s;e her di&s;cretion. He came di|rectly
to me notwith&s;tanding, and told me
what had pa&s;&s;ed. It was then, for the fir&s;t
time, that I di&s;covered I loved Mr. Vere.
I bur&s;t into tears, and clinging round my
father's neck, begged of him to &s;ave me
from my mother's rigour. My ge&s;ture
and words were too pa&s;&s;ionate for him not
to perceive, that there was &s;omething more
at my heart than mere di&s;like of the old
man. He charged me to deal &s;incerely. I
<PB N="112" REF="114">
loved him too well, and was my&s;elf too
frank to do otherwi&s;e. In &s;hort, I confe&s;&s;ed
my inclination for Mr. Vere, and his affecti|on
for me.</P>
<P>Though my kind father chid me gently for
admitting a lover without his or my mother's
approbation, yet at the &s;ame time he told
me, he would endeavour to di&s;&s;uade her
from pro&s;ecuting the other match; though
he could wi&s;h, he &s;aid, I would try to
bring my&s;elf to accept of it; adding he
was afraid my mother would be much in|cen&s;ed
by a denial.</P>
<P>My mother was fond of grandeur; and
would not like to have me marry any one,
who could not at once make me mi&s;tre&s;s of
a fine hou&s;e, and fine Garden, and fine
equipage; which I knew I mu&s;t not expect
to be the ca&s;e with Mr. Vere. His father
had &s;everal children, and was very frugal in
his temper: be&s;ides, as he was but of the
middle age, and of a very healthy con&s;ti|tution,
his &s;on's pro&s;pect of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the
e&s;tate, was to all human appearance, at a very
great di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;couragements, however, did
not hinder me from indulging my wi&s;hes.
My father's tenderne&s;s was the foundation
on which I built my hopes. I told Mr.
Vere the de&s;igns of one parent, and the kind
<PB N="113" REF="115">
conde&s;cen&s;ion of the other. Emboldened
by this information, he ventured to di&s;clo&s;e
his love to my father, begging his intere&s;t
with my mother in his favour. He had a
great kindne&s;s for the youth, and was &s;o
fond of me, that he would readily have
con&s;ented to my happine&s;s, if the fear of
di&s;obliging my mother had not checked
him. He repre&s;ented to her in the milde&s;t
manner, the utter di&s;like I had expre&s;&s;ed of the
propo&s;ed match, and conjured her not to in|&s;i&s;t
on it. My mother, unu&s;ed to be controul|ed,
was filled with re&s;entment both again&s;t him
and me; &s;he &s;aid, he encouraged me in my di&s;|obedience;
and that, if he did not unite
his authority to her's, in order to compel
me to marry the gentleman &s;he approved
of, it would make a total breach between
them.</P>
<P>My good father, who loved my mother
exceedingly, was alarmed at this menace.
Unwilling to come to extremities either with
her or me, he was at a lo&s;s how to act. His
paternal love at length prevailed, and he
determined, at all events, to &s;ave me from
the violence which he knew would be put
upon my heart.</P>
<P>My mother had never conde&s;cended to
talk to me on the &s;ubject: &s;he thought my
immediate obedience ought to have follow|ed
<PB N="114" REF="116">
the bare knowledge of her will. She
forbad me her &s;ight, and charged me never
to appear before her, 'till I came with a de|termination
to obey her.</P>
<P>However &s;evere this prohibition was, I
yielded to it with the le&s;s reluctance, as my
father's tender love made me amends for
my mother's har&s;hne&s;s. Perhaps, had &s;he
vouch&s;afed to rea&s;on a little with me, tem|pering
her arguments with a motherly kind|ne&s;s,
&s;he would have found me as flexible
as &s;he could wi&s;h; but the cour&s;e &s;he took
had a very contrary effect. I thought my|&s;elf
per&s;ecuted, and that it was for the ho|nour
of my love to per&s;evere. On the
other hand, my father's &s;ecret indulgence
encouraged me in th$ &s;entiments I entertain|ed,
and I now determined, not only to re|fu&s;e
my old lover, but to have my young
one.</P>
<P>My mother had given me a &s;tated time
in which I was to come to a re&s;olution, and
if I did not, at the expiration of it, acqui|e&s;ce,
I was to be pronounced a reprobate,
and to be no more con&s;idered as her child. In
this emergency I had recour&s;e to my father.
I told him there was nothing which I was
not ready to &s;uffer, rather than marry the
man I hated: my greate&s;t affliction was the
unea&s;ine&s;s I &s;aw him endure on my account;
<PB N="115" REF="117">
for my mother reproached him daily with
my ob&s;tinacy.</P>
<P>My father &s;aid, he thought the alternative
offered by my mother, was to be avoided
but in one way, and that was by marrying
Mr. Vere; for, added he, when &s;he finds
you re&s;olute in your refu&s;al of her choice,
not even my paternal authority will be able
to &s;creen you from her &s;everity, and your
life will be made mi&s;erable, without your
father's being able to relieve you. On the
other hand, when you are out of her hou&s;e,
&s;he cannot di&s;tre&s;s you, nor prevent me
from doing you the ju&s;tice which I owe my
child. Nay, po&s;&s;ibly in time, I may be
able to work out a reconciliation between
you; but &s;he mu&s;t not know that I was
con&s;enting to this marriage, le&s;t an irrecon|cileable
quarrel &s;hould en&s;ue. I fell at my
father's feet, and embraced his knees, for
this tender and unexpected proof of his af|fection.</P>
<P>Mr. Vere's father was no &s;tranger to his
&s;on's attachment, and we were very &s;ure he
would readily come into the propo&s;al which
my father intended to make.</P>
<P>The two parents had a meeting &s;ecretly,
where all terms of portion and &s;ettlement
were &s;peedily and privately adju&s;ted. Mr.
Vere the father, who had been long intimate
<PB N="116" REF="118">
in our family, knew very well the nece&s;&s;ity
there was for keeping the &s;ecret. After
this, my lover and I were to be married
privately, without the knowledge, &s;eeming|ly,
of any one in either family, excepting
one of the Mi&s;s Veres, who was to be pre|&s;ent;
and when the time of my probation
was expired, my father was to let my mo|ther
into the knowledge of this affair, as a
thing he had ju&s;t di&s;covered; and to pacify
her anger as well as he could.</P>
<P>Every thing was conducted in the manner
propo&s;ed. I was married with the utmo&s;t
privacy, and continued in my father's hou&s;e
'till the day arrived, when I was to give my
definitive an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Unfortunately for me, my mother cho&s;e
to receive it from my own mouth, and call|ed
me into her pre&s;ence. I appeared before
her trembling and terrified: I had not &s;een
her for a fortnight, and I was in dread, le&s;t
the di&s;covery I had to make, &s;hould bani&s;h
me her &s;ight perhaps for ever, unle&s;s my
father might influence her in time to forgive
me. She a&s;ked me, with a &s;tern brow,
What I had re&s;olved on? I had not courage
to make her an an&s;wer, but bur&s;t into tears.
She repeated her que&s;tion; and I could only
reply, Madam, it is not in my <HI>power</HI> to
obey you. She did not comprehend the
<PB N="117" REF="119">
meaning of my words, but imputing them
to ob&s;tinacy, commanded me to leave the
room, and not to &s;ee her face 'till I came to
a proper &s;en&s;e of my duty; at the &s;ame
time ordering me into my chamber, where
I was to be locked up.</P>
<P>I flew to my father, and conjured him to
let my mother know the truth at once, that I
might no longer be &s;ubject to &s;uch har&s;h treat|ment;
for I knew the being &s;ent home to
my hu&s;band would be the con&s;equence of her
being told that I had one.</P>
<P>My poor father was almo&s;t afraid to un|dertake
the ta&s;k, though he had been the
chief promoter of my marriage, and his au|thority
ought to have given &s;anction to it.
He ventured however to let her know, that
I had confe&s;&s;ed to him what my fears of her
immediate re&s;entment would not &s;uffer me
to di&s;cover whil&s;t I was in her pre&s;ence;
and what my aver&s;ion to the man &s;he pro|po&s;ed
to me, and the rigours I had been
threatened with, if I refu&s;ed him, had dri|ven
me to. The rage my mother flew into,
was little &s;hort of phrenzy, and my father
made ha&s;te to &s;end me out of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Vere's whole family received me
with great tenderne&s;s; but I was &s;orry at
leaving my father, who&s;e vi&s;its to me were
made but &s;eldom, and even tho&s;e by &s;tealth.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="120">
My &s;ituation, though I was united to the
man I loved, and care&s;&s;ed by all his family,
was far from being happy. My mother's
inflexible temper was not to be wrought
upon, notwith&s;tanding my father did his ut|mo&s;t
to prevail on her to &s;ee and to forgive
me; and &s;he carried her re&s;entment &s;o far,
that &s;he told my father, unle&s;s he cut me off
entirely in his will, &s;he was determined to
&s;eparate her&s;elf totally from him. This
was an extremity he by no means expected
&s;he would have gone to.</P>
<P>In a fit of &s;ickne&s;s, which had &s;eized him
a few years before, he had left me ten
thou&s;and pounds; five of this he had &s;e|cretly
transferred to Mr. Vere on the day
of my marriage, and had promi&s;ed him to
bequeath me five more at his death.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this di&s;po&s;ition, he pur|po&s;ed
making a new will, &s;o that he the le&s;s
&s;crupled giving my mother up the old
one, with a promi&s;e of making another a|greeable
to her reque&s;t.</P>
<P>My mother's jointure was already &s;ettled
on her; my elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter had received her
portion; &s;o that there was little bequeathed
by this te&s;tament, but my fortuue, and a
few other &s;mall legacies.</P>
<P>My mother tore the will with indignati|on,
and not &s;atisfied with my father's pro|mi&s;e,
in&s;i&s;ted on his putting it into executi|on
<PB N="119" REF="121">
immediately. In &s;hort, his ea&s;y temper
yielded to her importunities, and he had a will
drawn up by her in&s;tructions, in which I was
cutoff with one &s;hilling, and my intended for|tune
bequeathed to my elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter. My mo|ther
was made re&s;iduary legatee to everything
that &s;hould remain, after paying all the be|que&s;ts.
This would have amounted to a
con&s;iderable &s;um, if the half of my portion,
which was already paid without her know|ledge,
had not made &s;uch a dimunition in
the per&s;onal e&s;tate, that after paying my
&s;i&s;ter the whole of what was &s;pecified in
the will, there was &s;carce any thing likely to
remain.</P>
<P>Had my mother known this &s;ecret, &s;he
would not perhaps have been &s;o ready to
have made my father devi&s;e all my intended
fortune to my &s;i&s;ter. My father who was
aware of this, dur&s;t not however inform
her at that juncture, how much &s;he hurt
her&s;elf, by forcing him to &s;uch mea&s;ures.
She in&s;i&s;ted upon his leaving the whole of
what he de&s;igned for me to my elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter;
as well to convince him, &s;he &s;aid, that &s;he
had no &s;elf-intere&s;ted views, as to be an ex|ample
to other rebellious children.</P>
<P>My father had no remedy on the&s;e occa&s;i|ons,
but a patient acquie&s;cence: the will
was made, and my mother her&s;elf would
keep it.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="122">
My father took an opportunity the &s;ame
day to inform me what he had done, but
a&s;&s;ured me, he would immediately make an|other
will, agreeable to his fir&s;t intenti|ons,
and leave it in the hands of a faithful
friend.</P>
<P>This was his de&s;ign; but! alas he lived not
to execute it. He was &s;eized that night with
a paralytic di&s;order, which at once deprived
him of the u&s;e of his limbs and his &s;peech.
They who were about him believe he retain|ed
his &s;en&s;es, but he was not capable of
making him&s;elf under&s;tood even by &s;igns.
Alarmed with this di&s;mal account of my
beloved father's &s;ituation, I flew to the hou&s;e
without con&s;idering my mother's di&s;plea|&s;ure;
but I was not permitted to &s;ee him.
I filled the hou&s;e with my cries, but to no
purpo&s;e; I had not the &s;atisfaction of re|ceiving
even a farewell look from him,
which was all he was capable of be&s;towing
on me.</P>
<P>He langui&s;hed for &s;everal days in this me|lancholy
condition, and then, in &s;pite of the
aid of phy&s;ic, expired.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of this dear father &s;o entirely
took up my thoughts, that I never reflected
on the lo&s;s of the remaining part of my
fortune; but it was not &s;o with my father-in-law.
There had been a &s;ettlement made
on me in con&s;equence of the fortune &punc;pro|mi&s;ed;
<PB N="121" REF="123">
though not equal to what it de|manded,
yet &s;uperior to the half which was
paid. He relied on my father's word for the
remainder, and had no doubt of its being
&s;ecured to him, knowing his circum&s;tances,
as well as his &s;trict integrity, and that my &s;i&s;|ter
had actually received the &s;ame fortune
which I was promi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Mr. Vere had four daughters, and it was
on this fortune he chiefly depended to provide
for them.</P>
<P>The news of my being cut off with a
&s;hilling exceedingly &s;urprized and exa&s;perated
him. Unluckily I had not mentioned to
him, nor even to my hu&s;band, the will
which my father had been obliged to make.
The a&s;&s;urances he gave me, of immediately
making another in my favour, prevented me;
as I thought it would only be a very &s;evere
proof of my mother's enmity to the family,
which I could have wi&s;hed to conceal from
them; e&s;pecially as I did not imagine it
would have affected me afterwards. Mr.
Vere the elder was from home when my fa|ther
died, and his bu&s;ine&s;s detained him for
more than a month after his funeral was
over. My hu&s;band, on this occa&s;ion, &s;hew|ed
the tender and di&s;intere&s;ted love he bore
me; he affected to make as light as po&s;&s;ible
of this unexpected di&s;appointment, but at
<PB N="122" REF="124">
the &s;ame time expre&s;&s;ed his unea&s;ine&s;s, left
his father &s;hould carry matters to an extremity
with my mother, from whom we knew we
were to expect nothing by mild methods.</P>
<P>It was now thought advi&s;eable, that I
&s;hould write to my mother, to condole with
her on my father's death; again to intreat
her forgivene&s;s of my fault, and, as &s;ome
mitigation of it, to acknowledge that it was
not only with my father's privity, but even
with his con&s;ent and approbation, that I had
married.</P>
<P>I wrote this letter in a &s;train of the utmo&s;t
humility, without mentioning a word of my
fortune; <HI>that</HI> I thought it would be time
enough for me to do, if I could prevail on
my mother to &s;ee me, and would at all events
come better from my hu&s;band or his father,
than from me. But I gained nothing by
this, only &s;ome unkind reflections on my
father's memory, and a me&s;&s;age, that &s;ince
he thought proper to marry his daughter in
a manner &s;o highly di&s;agreeable to her mo|ther,
he &s;hould have taken care of providing
for her; as he could not expect a parent, &s;o
di&s;obliged as &s;he had been, would take any
notice of me.</P>
<P>My mother had been left &s;ole executrix to
my father's forced will; and &s;he took care
to put my &s;i&s;ter, and the other legatees, into
<PB N="123" REF="125">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what was bequeathed to
them, in a very &s;hort time after his de|cea&s;e.
She found there was an unexpected
deficiency in his per&s;onal fortune, in&s;o|much
that there was barely enough to
pay his debts; and that her being left the
re&s;idue, after the &s;pecified legacies were paid,
amounted to nothing. On the contrary,
had my father's ju&s;t intentions taken place,
in leaving me five thou&s;and pounds, &s;he
would have come in for the other five;
but the whole ten thou&s;and now went to my
&s;i&s;ter,</P>
<P>She was not long however at a lo&s;s to know
how this came to pa&s;s. Mr. Vere determined
to a&s;&s;ert his own, and his &s;on's right; and
being exceedingly provoked at my mother's
behaviour, wrote to her immediately on his
return home; and having informed her of
the &s;ettlement made on me, on account of
the fortune already paid, and what was far|ther
agreed on to be paid by my father, told
her, he expected that this promi&s;e &s;hould be
punctually fulfilled. He &s;aid, he knew &s;he
had it in her power to do this; and &s;ince it
was by her contrivance I had been robbed of
my ju&s;t right, if honour, and the duty of a
parent, would not induce her to make me
proper amends, &s;he mu&s;t excu&s;e him, if he
<PB N="124" REF="126">
made u&s;e of &s;uch means as the laws allowed
him, in order to compel her.</P>
<P>Such a letter, to a woman of my mother's
temper, met with &s;uch a reception as might
be expected. She tore it before his me&s;|&s;enger's
face; and de&s;ired him to tell his
ma&s;ter, that as what he had already obtained
was by fraud, &s;o he was at liberty to make
u&s;e of force to recover the remainder; but
with her con&s;ent, he never &s;hould have a
&s;ingle &s;hilling.</P>
<P>This exa&s;perating reply, made my father-in-law
directly commence a &s;uit again&s;t her,
in which the other legatees were made par|ties.
The di&s;tre&s;s I felt on this occa&s;ion is
&s;carce to be imagined; the breach was now
&s;o widened between my mother and my hu&s;|band's
family, that there remained not the
lea&s;t hope of its ever being clo&s;ed. Mr.
Vere unwillingly joined with his father in
pur&s;uit of the&s;e mea&s;ures. He would for
my &s;ake much rather have yielded up his ex|pectations,
than &s;upported them at the ex|pence
of my quiet; but his father's will, and
ju&s;tice to the re&s;t of the family, compelled
him to proceed, and deprived me of any
pretence for interpo&s;ing.</P>
<P>The law-&s;uit was carrying on with great
acrimony on both &s;ides, when an event hap|pened,
that made me then, and has indeed
<PB N="125" REF="127">
ever &s;ince, look with indifference on every
thing in this life; it was the death of my
hu&s;band. He was &s;natched from me by a
violent fever, before he reached his twentieth
year.</P>
<P>I will not pretend to de&s;cribe my &s;uffer|ings
to you on this &s;ad occa&s;ion; they were
aggravated by my being near the time of ly|ing-in.</P>
<P>Whatever affliction Mr. Vere felt for the
death of his only &s;on, it did not make him
forgetful of what he owed his daughters; and
he was re&s;olved to carry on the law-&s;uit with
the utmo&s;t vigour.</P>
<P>You may &s;uppo&s;e the hou&s;e wherein I had
lo&s;t a beloved hu&s;band appeared a di&s;mal
place to me, e&s;pecially in my pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion.
I thought too, my father's looks be|gan
to grow colder to me than they u&s;ed to
be; and I begged I might have his permi&s;|&s;ion
to remove for a while. He did not
oppo&s;e it, and I went, at the pre&s;&s;ing in|treaties
of your favourite, the good old dean,
to his hou&s;e; where he and his lady behaved
to me with more than parental tenderne&s;s.
My health was in &s;o declining a way, that
this worthy man (as I have &s;ince learned)
made &s;everal applications to my mother to
&s;ee me, but without &s;ucce&s;s. At length the
hour of my delivery arrived, and I was
<PB N="126" REF="128">
brought to-bed of a dead female child. The
e&s;tate, in ca&s;e of Mr. Vere's dying without
i&s;&s;ue, devolved on his &s;i&s;ters; and I was in
hopes this circum&s;tance, &s;o favourable to the
young ladies, would have induced their fa|ther
to have been le&s;s rigorous in per&s;i&s;ting
in his claim. But in this I was deceived;
he loved money, and was be&s;ides full of re|&s;entment
again&s;t my mother. I thought how|ever
of an expedient, which I flattered my|&s;elf
might work upon him; and by good for|tune
it &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>Mr. Vere, though I had left his hou&s;e,
vi&s;ited me con&s;tantly, and kept up a &s;hew
of tenderne&s;s, which I am &s;ure he had not
in his heart. I told him one day, whil&s;t I
was &s;till confined to my bed, that as I had
now lo&s;t both my hu&s;band and my child, a
very moderate income would be &s;ufficient for
me; and that as I valued my mother's peace
of mind, beyond any &s;elfi&s;h con&s;ideration,
I was very willing to give up half my join|ture,
provided he would drop his &s;uit.
Mr. Vere &s;eemed &s;urprized at the pro|po&s;al:
he &s;aid, he wondered I could be
&s;o blind to my own intere&s;t, and that all
he was doing was purely for my &s;ake.
I thanked him for his pretended friend|&s;hip,
but a&s;&s;ured him, he could &s;erve me
no way &s;o effectually, as by coming into
<PB N="127" REF="129">
the mea&s;ure I propo&s;ed. Mr. Vere &s;aid, I
talked like a child; but he would con&s;ider of
it. The following day he called on me
again, and told me, that to make me ea&s;y,
he was willing to come into my propo&s;al; that
he would have the proper in&s;truments drawn,
by which I was to relinqui&s;h half my jointure;
and he in con&s;equence to give up all claim on
my father's e&s;tate.</P>
<P>I was much better plea&s;ed, at this lo&s;ing
agreement, than if I had acquired a large ac|ce&s;&s;ion
of fortune.</P>
<P>Mr. Vere &s;oon got the proper deeds ready,
and they were executed in form.</P>
<P>I now relap&s;ed into an illne&s;s, from which
I was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been quite recovered,
and my life was thought in great danger. I
have &s;ince been told, that Mr. Vere repented
his agreement at that juncture, and told &s;ome
of his friends, that if he had not been &s;o
ha&s;ty, he &s;hould have had a chance for my
jointure and my fortune too.</P>
<P>I begged of the dean to go to my mother,
and u&s;e his la&s;t efforts on her, to prevail with
her to &s;ee and forgive me before I died; at
the &s;ame time, I &s;ent her the relea&s;e I had
procured from Mr. Vere, which I knew was
the mo&s;t acceptable pre&s;ent I could make her.
The dean urged the danger I was in, without
its &s;eeming to make much impre&s;&s;ion on her.
<PB N="128" REF="130">
I am willing to believe, that &s;he thought the
dean exaggerated in his account of my ill|ne&s;s.
He owned to me him&s;elf, that he
was &s;hocked to find her &s;o obdurate. At
length, he took the paper out of his pocket,
and pre&s;enting it to her, I am &s;orry, madam,
&s;aid he, I cannot prevail upon you to act
like a parent or a chri&s;tian; your daughter I
fear will not &s;urvive her pre&s;ent malady; but
&s;he will have the comfort to con&s;ider, that
&s;he has left nothing unattempted to obtain
that forgivene&s;s, which you &s;o cruelly deny
her. I hope, lady Grim&s;ton, your la&s;t hours
may be as peaceful, as her's I tru&s;t will be
from this reflection. There, madam&mdash;she
has by that in&s;trument left you di&s;engaged
from a trouble&s;ome and vexatious law-&s;uit,
that would, if pur&s;ued, infallibly turn out to
your di&s;advantage; it was all &s;he <HI>could</HI> do,
and what few children, u&s;ed like her, <HI>would</HI>
have done.</P>
<P>My mother, a good deal alarmed at the
dean's manner of &s;peaking, now examined
the contents of the paper. She &s;eemed af|fected,
and called him back, as he was ju&s;t
leaving the room. She told him, &s;he was
not lo&s;t to the feelings of nature; and that
if he thought her pre&s;ence would contri|bute
to ea&s;e my mind of the remor&s;e it mu&s;t
<PB N="129" REF="131">
needs labour under, &s;he was not again&s;t &s;ee|ing
me.</P>
<P>The good man, glad to find her in this
yielding di&s;po&s;ition, told her &s;he could not
too &s;oon execute her intention; and pre&s;&s;ed
her to come to his hou&s;e directly. She &s;uf|fered
him to put her into his coach, and he
carried her home with him. The interview,
on my &s;ide, was attended with tears of joy,
tenderne&s;s, and contrition. My mother did
not depart from her u&s;ual au&s;terity; &s;he gave
me but her hand to ki&s;s, and pronounced her
forgivene&s;s and her ble&s;&s;ing in &s;o languid a
manner, as greatly damped the fervour of my
joy.</P>
<P>She &s;taid with me not more than a quar|ter
of an hour, and having talked of indif|ferent
things, without once &s;o much as men|tioning
what I had done, &s;he took a cold and
formal leave.</P>
<P>This interview, as little cordial as my
mother's behaviour was to me, had &s;o good
an effect on me, that I began perceptibly
to mend from that hour. She &s;ent indeed
con&s;tantly to enquire how I did; but avoid|ed
coming, le&s;t, as &s;he &s;aid, &s;he &s;hould meet
with Mr. Vere, whom &s;he could never for|give.
As &s;oon as I was in a condition to go
abroad, I went to pay my duty to her. She
received me with civility, but no tenderne&s;s;
<PB N="130" REF="132">
nor has &s;he ever from that time made me
the lea&s;t recompence for what I have lo&s;t;
her permitting me to &s;ee her, &s;he thinks &s;uf|ficient
amends.</P>
<P>I did not chu&s;e to return to Mr. Vere's
hou&s;e, as I had only a polite, not a kind in|vitation.
One of his daughters, &s;he who
had been pre&s;ent at my marriage, and who
always had &s;hewn mo&s;t affection towards me,
was about this time married to a gentleman,
who&s;e e&s;tate lay in another county. When the
bride went home, &s;he pre&s;&s;ed me to go with
her &s;o warmly, that I could not refu&s;e her;
and during the time I &s;taid with her, I re|ceived
&s;o many marks of tenderne&s;s from
her, that I re&s;olved to &s;ettle in her neigh|bourhood;
and have now a little hou&s;e near
her, where I have re&s;ided con&s;tantly ever
&s;ince. I come once or twice a year to pay
a vi&s;it to my mother, but my reception, as
you may &s;ee, is always cold, and I &s;eldom
&s;tay more than a few days,</P>
<P>Old Mr. Vere is dead; and his daughters,
who were coheire&s;&s;es to his e&s;tate, are all
married, &s;o that the family is intirely di&s;|per&s;ed;
but notwith&s;tanding this, and the
number of years that have pa&s;&s;ed ever &s;ince
my marriage, my mother cannot yet endure
the name of the family: and always, as you
<PB N="131" REF="133">
may have ob&s;erved, calls me by my maiden
name.</P>
<P>I was much affected at the &s;tory of the
amiable Mrs. Vere. The &s;weet melancholy,
which predominates in her countenance, &s;hews
that the &s;pirits, when broken in the bud of
youth, are hardly to be recovered. What a
tyrant this lady Grim&s;ton is! I did not ad|mire
her before, but I now ab&s;olutely di&s;like
her. What a wife and a mother has &s;he
been to a hu&s;band and a daughter, who
might have con&s;tituted the happine&s;s of a
woman of a different temper! And yet &s;he
pa&s;&s;es for a wonderful good woman, and a
pattern of all tho&s;e virtues of a religion,
which meekne&s;s and forgivene&s;s characteri&s;e.
She is mi&s;taken, if &s;he thinks that au&s;terity
is nece&s;&s;ary to chri&s;tianity. The mo&s;t that
my charity allows me to believe of &s;uch
people is, that they impo&s;e on <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> at
a time when the mo&s;t di&s;cerning perhaps
think that they are endeavouring to impo&s;e
on others.</P>
<P>What an angel is my good mother, when
compared to this her friend, whom her hu|mility
makes her look upon as her &s;uperior
in virtue! I am very angry with Sir George,
who in his re&s;entment &s;aid to me once, that
&s;he was like lady Grim&s;ton. I then knew
<PB N="132" REF="134">
but little of that lady's character, or I &s;hould
have reproved him for it.</P>
<P>I conjured Mrs. Vere to make her vi&s;it
longer than &s;he had at fir&s;t intended. She
told me, &s;he would mo&s;t gladly do it; but
that it was a liberty &s;he did not dare to take,
unle&s;s her mother a&s;ked her to prolong it;
which, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he po&s;&s;ibly might do, in
complai&s;ance to me.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 4.&mdash;My mother I find has
made lady Grim&s;ton her confident in relation
to my affairs; the dear woman never keeps
her mind to her&s;elf on any &s;ubject. Lady
Grim&s;ton highly applauds her conduct in that
bu&s;ine&s;s; and be&s;towed a few civil words on
me for my filial duty, intermixed with an
ungrateful compari&s;on of her own daughter's
behaviour. And &s;he condoled with her&s;elf,
by &s;aying, that <HI>good parents</HI> had not always
<HI>good children.</HI> She told my mother, that &s;he
wi&s;hed to &s;ee the child (meaning me) hap|pily
di&s;po&s;ed of; for that, notwith&s;tanding
the prudence of my behaviour, the world
would be apt to ca&s;t reflections on me, on
account of the abruptne&s;s with which the
match was broken off, without the true rea|&s;ons
being known: and my illne&s;s, &s;he &s;aid,
might be imputed to the di&s;appointment;
which might incline people to &s;u&s;pect the
rejection had been on Mr. Faulkland's &s;ide.
<PB N="133" REF="135">
What a provoking hint was this my dear!
it has really alarmed my mother, who
depends much on the judgment of her
friend, and has at the &s;ame time &s;o nice a
regard to the honour of her family. I wi&s;h
that formal old woman would mind her own
bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 6.&mdash;My mother and lady
Grim&s;ton have had abundance of private
confabulation the&s;e two days, from which
Mrs. Vere and I am excluded. I wi&s;h there
may not be &s;ome mi&s;chief a brewing. One
thing, however, has given me plea&s;ure; la|dy
Grim&s;ton has invited her daughter to &s;tay
at Grim&s;ton-hall as long as my mother and I
continue here.</P>
<P>Mrs. Vere tells me, &s;he &s;u&s;pects the
&s;ubject of their conferences; but &s;he is per|ver&s;e,
and will not tell me what &s;he thinks,
for fear, as &s;he &s;ays, &s;he &s;hould have gue&s;s|ed
wrong, and her &s;urmi&s;es would only teaze
me.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 10.&mdash;A packet &s;ent me
from London&mdash;A letter from Sir George&mdash;one
from my Cecilia&mdash;and &s;o &s;oon too! Wel|come,
welcome, thou faithful me&s;&s;enger, from
the faithfulle&s;t of hearts!</P>
<P>Thou dear anticipating little prophete&s;s!
What put it into your head to call Mr. Ar|nold
a new conque&s;t, upon my but barely
<PB N="134" REF="136">
mentioning him to you? I was ju&s;t going
to tell you all; and behold your own whim|&s;ical
imagination has &s;ugge&s;ted the mo&s;t ma|terial
part to you already. You de&s;ire me to
be &s;incere: was that nece&s;&s;ary, my &s;i&s;ter,
from <HI>you</HI> to <HI>me?</HI> You &s;ay, you are <HI>&s;ure Mr.
Arnold is, or will be my lover;</HI> and in&s;i&s;t on
my being more particular in my de&s;cription
of him. What a &s;trange girl you are! again
I a&s;k you, What put this into your head?
What bu&s;y little &s;pirit of intelligence flew
to you with this news before I knew it
my&s;elf? For as to the fact, it is but too
certain.</P>
<P>This has been the &s;ubject of my mother's
and lady Grim&s;ton's private conferences;
and Mrs. Vere (&s;ly thing as &s;he is) gue&s;&s;ed
it. It &s;eems Mr. Arnold di&s;clo&s;ed his pa&s;|&s;ion
to lady Grim&s;ton, in order to a&s;k her
advice about it. She loves mightily to be
con&s;ulted; and ill-&s;tarred as I am, did me
the honour to recommend me &s;trongly to
him; and &s;he has prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my mother
too in favour of this new man. I wi&s;h the
meddling old dame had been dumb. Now
&s;hall I go through another fiery tryal! Hea|ven
help me, if lady Grim&s;ton were to be
my judge! But my mother is all good|ne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="137">
Well, but you want a de&s;cription of this
man. I will give it you, though I have &s;carce
patience to write about him. Indeed, Cecilia,
I am vexed; I fore&s;ee a great deal of trouble
from that quarter.&mdash;But come, I will try
what I can &s;ay.</P>
<P>The man is about thirty, genteel, and
hand&s;ome enough; at lea&s;t he is reckoned
&s;o, and I believe I &s;hould think him &s;o, if I
were not angry with him. He is very like
your brother Henry; and you know he is an
allowed hand&s;ome man. He &s;eems to have
plain good &s;en&s;e, and is good humoured, I
believe: I do not know of what colour his
eyes are, for I never looked much at him.
Lady Grim&s;ton &s;ays he is a <HI>&s;cholar</HI> (a thing
&s;he pretends to value highly), and a mighty
&s;ober, pious, worthy gentleman. He is of
a very good family; and has an e&s;tate of
about fifteen hundred pounds a year, upon
which there is a jointure of three hundred
pounds a year, paid to his brother's widow.
Part of the e&s;tate is in Kent, and part in this
county of E&s;&s;ex, where he has a man&s;ion-hou&s;e,
a well enough looking old-fa&s;hioned
place, &s;omething in the Grim&s;ton-hall &s;tile,
at about a mile di&s;tance from this; where he
pa&s;&s;es mo&s;t of his time.</P>
<P>I have told you already, he plays divinely
<PB N="136" REF="138">
on &s;everal in&s;truments; this is the only cir|cum&s;tance
about him that plea&s;es me.</P>
<P>He has not yet made his addre&s;&s;es to
me in form; yet we all know that he in|tends
it, from his uncommon a&s;&s;iduity to|wards
me; but he has a &s;ort of re&s;erve a|bout
him, and loves to do every thing in his
own way.</P>
<P>Ble&s;s me!&mdash;here he is&mdash;his chariot has ju&s;t
driven into the court; and Mrs. Vere peeps
in upon me, and with a mo&s;t vexatious arch|ne&s;s,
bids me come down to the parlour;
but I will not, unle&s;s my mother de&s;ires me.
I will go into the garden, to be for a while
out of the way.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 11.&mdash;Ye&s;terday evening
was productive of nothing but looks and
compliments, and bows, and &s;o forth; ex|cept
two or three delightful pieces of mu|&s;ick,
which he executed incomparably.
But this morning, my Cecilia, Oh! this
morning! the man &s;poke out, told me in
down-right plain Engli&s;h, that he loved me!
How in&s;ipid is &s;uch a declaration, when it
comes from one, who is indifferent to us!
I do not know how it was, but in&s;tead of
being aba&s;hed, I could have &s;miled in his
face when he declared him&s;elf; but you may
be &s;ure I did not, that would not have been
pretty.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="139">
I was &s;itting in the little drawing-room,
reading, when he came in. To be &s;ure he
was &s;ent to me by the antient ladies, other|wi&s;e
he would not have intruded; for the
man is not ill-bred. The book happened
to be Horace; upon his entering the room,
I laid it by; he a&s;ked me politely enough,
what were my &s;tudies. When I named the
author, he took the book up, and opening
the leaves, &s;tarted, and looked me full in
the face; I coloured. My charming Mi&s;s
Bidulph, &s;aid he, do you prefer this to the
agreeable eetertainment of fini&s;hing this
beautiful ro&s;e here, that &s;eems to blu&s;h at
your neglect of it? He &s;poke this, point|ing
to a little piece of embroidery that lay
in a frame before me. I was nettled at
the que&s;tion, it was too a&s;&s;uming. Sir, I
hope I was as innocently, and as u&s;efully em|ployed;
and I a&s;&s;ure you I give a greater
portion of my time to my needle, than to
my book.</P>
<P>You are &s;o lovely, madam, that nothing
you can do needs an apology. An apology,
I'll a&s;&s;ure you! did not this look as if the
man thought I ought to beg his pardon for
under&s;tanding Latin? For this accidental,
and I think (to a woman) trivial accom|pli&s;hment,
I am indebted, you know, to Sir
George; who took &s;o much pains with me,
<PB N="138" REF="140">
the two or three &s;ummers he was indi&s;po&s;ed
at Sidney-Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>He then proceeded to tell me how much
he admired, how much he loved me! and
that having been encouraged by lady Grim|&s;ton's
a&s;&s;uring him that I was di&s;engaged
(ob&s;erve that), he pre&s;umed to tell me &s;o.
Oh! thought I, perhaps thou art thy&s;elf a
Grim&s;tonian, and do not think it nece&s;&s;ary
that the heart &s;hould be confulted. I an|&s;wered
him mighty civilly, and mighty lit|tle
to the purpo&s;e. Sir, I thank you for
your favourable &s;entiments&mdash;Lady Grim&s;ton
does me a great deal of honour&mdash;I think
my&s;elf happy in her good opinion&mdash;But
he was not to be &s;o put off, he pre&s;&s;ed me
to give him hopes, as he called it. Alas! I
have no hopes to give him. He &s;aid, he
would not pre&s;ume to mention his love to
my mother, though lady Grim&s;ton pre&s;&s;ed
him to it (it was like her), 'till he had fir&s;t
declared him&s;elf to me. This was not in|delicate;
my heart thanked him for it,
though I only returned him a bow. We
were &s;ea&s;onably (to me at lea&s;t) interrupted
here, by the arrival of my friend the dean.
He had come to &s;ee lady Grim&s;ton, ju&s;t as
Mr. Arnold had entered into conver&s;ation
with me; the old gentleman had a mind to
walk in the garden; the little drawing-room,
<PB N="139" REF="141">
where we were, opened into it, by a gla&s;s
door; &s;o that lady Grim&s;ton and my mother
were obliged to bring him that way. Though
I was glad that the conver&s;ation was broke
off, yet I could have wi&s;hed that I had fir&s;t
had an opportunity of throwing a little cold
water on Mr. Arnold's <HI>hopes,</HI> le&s;t he &s;hould
have put too favourable an interpretation on
the reception I gave him, and mention the
thing to my mother, before I had time to
&s;peak to her.</P>
<P>I was in &s;ome confu&s;ion at their entering
the room. Mr. Arnold had at that minute
laid hold of one of my hands, and I had but
ju&s;t time to withdraw it, when the door flew
open to give entrance to the two ladies and
the good man: the latter lifting up both his
hands, as if con&s;cious of having done &s;ome|thing
wrong, with a good-humoured free|dom,
a&s;ked pardon; but with a look that
&s;eemed to indicate, he thought the apology
nece&s;&s;ary both to Mr. Arnold and me. This
di&s;concerted me more; my mother &s;miled,
and lady Grim&s;ton drew up her long neck,
and winked at the dean. I took up my hat,
that lay in a window, without well-knowing
what I did, and &s;aid, I would wait on them
into the garden. Mr. Arnold followed my
example; but looked at me, I do not know
how&mdash;impertinently&mdash;as if he thought
<PB N="140" REF="142">
I did not di&s;like him. I took one turn with
them, and then &s;lipped away, under pretence
of going in to dre&s;s. I ran directly into
Mrs. Vere's room, and told her what had
pa&s;&s;ed between Mr. Arnold and me. She
laughed, and &s;aid, &s;he could have told me
long ago it would have come to that. I
knew Mr. Arnold admired you, &s;aid &s;he,
the fir&s;t time I &s;aw you in his company; he
is no contemptible conque&s;t I can tell you.
He a&s;&s;ured my mother, that you were the
only woman he ever &s;aw in his life that had
made an impre&s;&s;ion on him; and I am in|clined
to believe him, for he is not a man
of an amorous complexion; nor did I ever
hear of his making his addre&s;&s;es to any one,
though he might have his choice of the be&s;t
fortunes, and the be&s;t families in the county;
for the ladies, I mu&s;t inform you, admire
him exceedingly; and when you are known
to be his choice, you will be the envy of
all the young women in the county. I &s;igh|ed,
(I don't know why) and &s;aid, I de&s;ired
not to create envy on that account. Mrs.
Vere &s;aid, why really Mi&s;s Bidulph, if your
heart is at liberty, I know of no man more
worthy of it than Mr. Arnold; but perhaps
(looking with a kind earne&s;tne&s;s on me) that
may not be your ca&s;e. I told her, my heart
was not engaged (as it really is not; for in|deed,
<PB N="141" REF="143">
Cecilia, I do not think of Mr. Faulk|land);
but that I did not find in my&s;elf any
great inclination towards Mr. Arnold. Oh!
my dear, &s;aid &s;he, if you find no di&s;inclina|tion,
it is enough. I married for love, yet
I was far from being happy. The vexation
that I occa&s;ioned in my own and my hu&s;|band's
family, was a counter-balance to the
&s;atisfaction of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the man I loved.
Mr. Arnold, be&s;ides being very amiable in
his per&s;on, has good &s;en&s;e, and good tem|per;
and if you marry him with nothing
more than indifference, gratitude will &s;oon
produce love in &s;uch a brea&s;t as yours. Were
there any thing like aver&s;ion in your heart,
then indeed it would be criminal in you to
accept of him.</P>
<P>Mrs. Vere delivered her &s;entiments with
&s;uch a calm &s;weetne&s;s, &s;uch a di&s;intere&s;ted
&s;incerity, that what &s;he &s;aid made an im|pre&s;&s;ion
on me. We are apt, contrary as it
may &s;eem to rea&s;on, to be more wrought
upon by the opinion and advice of young
people like our&s;elves, than by that of per|&s;ons,
who&s;e experience certainly gives them
a better right to form judgments: but we
have a &s;ort of a natural repugnance to the
being dictated to, even by tho&s;e who have
an authority to do it; and as age gives a &s;u|periority,
every thing that comes from it car|ries
<PB N="142" REF="144">
a &s;ort of air of pre&s;cribing, which we
are wonderfully inclined to reject.</P>
<P>Had lady Grim&s;ton &s;aid this to me, it
would have put me upon my guard, as &s;u&s;|pecting
a de&s;ign on my liberty of choice.
Even my good mother might have been li&s;|tened
to on this &s;ubject not without unea&s;i|ne&s;s;
though my duty to her would not &s;uf|fer
me to give her a moment's pain, unle&s;s I
was &s;ure that my eternal as well as temporal
happine&s;s was at &s;take.</P>
<P>I told Mrs. Vere that I had no aver&s;ion to
Mr. Arnold; on the contrary, that if I
had a &s;i&s;ter, I &s;hould wi&s;h her married to
him. Now, my Cecilia, the mi&s;chief of
it is, there <HI>can</HI> be no rea&s;onable objection
made to him: he is a very tolerable man;
but I knew a man once that I liked better&mdash;
but fye, fye upon him! I am &s;ure I ought
not to like him, and therefore I will not. I
am po&s;itive, if I were let alone, I &s;hould be
as happy as ever.</P>
<P>I told you I got a letter from my brother;
he &s;ays in it, he has had one from Mr. Faulk|land,
who is now in your part of the world.
He tells Sir George, that &startq;if my lady Bi|dulph
will be &s;o good as to &s;ee Mi&s;s B. and
conver&s;e with her, he is not without hopes
that &s;he may &s;o far exculpate him, as to in|duce
my lady to repeal his &s;entence of ba|ni&s;hment.&endq;
<PB N="143" REF="145">
Sir George adds his own wi&s;hes
for this, but &s;ays (to give you <HI>his</HI> words) he
fears the wench will not be hone&s;t enough to
do Faulkland ju&s;tice&mdash;ju&s;tice! what can
my brother mean by this? How ungenerous
the&s;e men are, even the be&s;t of them, in
love matters! He knows the poor girl doats
on her de&s;troyer, and might perhaps take
&s;hame to <HI>her&s;elf,</HI> rather than throw as much
blame on him as he de&s;erves. I think this
is all the ju&s;tice that can be expected from
her; and how poor an extenuation would
this make of his guilt! It would only add to
the merit of <HI>her</HI> &s;ufferings, without le&s;&s;ening
his fault.</P>
<P>To what purpo&s;e then would it be? I
know my mother's &s;entiments already on
that head. I would not &s;hew Sir George's
letter to her, he had &s;aid &s;o many ridiculous
things about lady Grim&s;ton in it, which I
know would have offended her highly; o|therwi&s;e,
on account of Mr. Faulkland's pa|ragraph,
I &s;hould have been glad &s;he had
&s;een it.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 12.&mdash;Ah! my &s;i&s;ter! my
friend! What &s;hall I do? Oh! that offici|ous
lady Grim&s;ton&mdash;What ill &s;tar drove
me to her hou&s;e? Nothing would &s;erve her
but &s;he mu&s;t know what Mr. Arnold &s;aid to
me in the drawing-room conference; and
<PB N="144" REF="146">
how I had behaved. She made her enqui|ry
before my mother and the dean, after I
had left them in the garden. What could
the man do? He had no rea&s;on to conceal
what pa&s;&s;ed, and frankly owned he had made
me an offer of his heart. Well, and how did
Mi&s;s receive it, a&s;ked lady Grim&s;ton? With
that mode&s;ty and polite &s;weetne&s;s that &s;he
does every thing, an&s;wered Mr. Arnold. He
could &s;ay no le&s;s.</P>
<P>He thence took occa&s;ion to apply parti|cularly
to my mother, apologizing at the
&s;ame time for his not having done it before.
What the &s;elf-&s;ufficient creature added, I know
not; for my mother, from whom I had this
account, did not repeat all he &s;aid; but it
&s;eems it was enough to make her imagine I
had not heard him reluctantly, and according|ly
&s;he gave him her permi&s;&s;ion to win me
and wear me.</P>
<P>I could cry for very vexation, to be made
&s;uch a puppet of. This eclairci&s;&s;ement I
dreaded before I had time to explain my|&s;elf
to my mother. That be&s;t of women,
&s;till anticipating what I had to &s;ay, congra|tulated
me on my extraordinary prudence, in
not letting a childi&s;h mi&s;placed attachment
keep &s;uch a hold on my heart, as to make
me blind to the merits of a more de&s;erving
object.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="147">
Dear madam, &s;aid I, &s;ure Mr. Arnold
did not &s;ay that I encouraged his addre&s;&s;es.
Encouraged, my dear! why &s;ure the hearing,
from a young lady of your education, is en|couragement
enough to a man of &s;en&s;e.&mdash;
I heard him with complai&s;ance, madam, be|cau&s;e
I thought <HI>that</HI> due to him; but I had
not time to tell him, that it was my wi&s;h to
remain &s;ingle, at lea&s;t for &s;ome time. My
mother looked &s;urprized. &startq;Sidney, this
is not what I expected from you; I flattered
my&s;elf you thought no longer of Mr. Faulk|land.&endq;</P>
<P>She contracted her brow a little. Ma|dam,
I do not; indeed I think no more of
him; but may I not be permitted to conti|nue
as I am?</P>
<P>Had you never had any engagement with
Mr. Faulkland, an&s;wered my mother, I
&s;hould be far from urging you on this occa|&s;ion;
but circum&s;tanced as you now are, I
think your honour is concerned.</P>
<P>Lady Grim&s;ton has put your affair in &s;uch
a light to me, as I never con&s;idered it in be|fore.
How mortifying mu&s;t the reflection
be, my dear, to think that it may be &s;aid
Mr. Faulkland perhaps flew off, from &s;ome
di&s;advantageous circum&s;tance he di&s;covered
in regard to you. The world wants not en|vious,
malicious tongues enough to give it
this turn. Your unlucky illne&s;s, and your
<PB N="146" REF="148">
brother's ill-timed a&s;&s;iduity in going &s;o often
to him when he was at Richmond, looks as
if we had been endeavouring to recall him.
Every body knows the marriage was almo&s;t
concluded; and lady Grim&s;ton, though &s;he
thinks our rea&s;ons for breaking it off were
extremely cogent, yet as &s;he knows the
world well, thinks it has not virtue enough
to believe tho&s;e to be the true rea&s;ons, and
that it will be much more apt to put an invi|dious
con&s;truction on the affair, that may be
very detrimental to you in your future pro|&s;pects.
The&s;e con&s;iderations alone ought to
determine you; but there is one &s;till of
greater moment, which I hope, from the
goodne&s;s of your heart, will have &s;till greater
weight with you. That unfortunate young
lady, who <HI>ought</HI> to be the wife of Mr. Faulk|land,
if you were once put beyond the reach
even of his mo&s;t di&s;tant hope, would &s;tand
the better chance for having ju&s;tice done to
her; at lea&s;t it would leave him void of that
pretence which he at fir&s;t pleaded, and which
probably he will continue to do, while you
remain &s;ingle. Think &s;eriou&s;ly of the mat|ter,
my love. I &s;hall only add, that Mr.
Arnold is every way an unexceptionable
match, and that your acceptance of him will
be extremely agreeable to me; as on the
contrary, your refu&s;al will give an unea&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="147" REF="149">
to your indulgent mother, which &s;he never
yet experienced from you.</P>
<P>She left me with the&s;e cruel words, cruel
in their kindne&s;s&mdash;Oh! &s;he knows I am flex|ible
by nature, and to <HI>her</HI> will, yielding as
air. What can I do? My heart is not in a
di&s;po&s;ition to love&mdash;Yet again and again I re|peat
it, Mr. Faulkland has no intere&s;t there.
What he once had he has lo&s;t; but I cannot
compel it to like, and unlike, and like anew
at plea&s;ure. Fain would I bring my&s;elf
chearfully to conform to my mother's will,
for I have no will of my own. I never knew
what it was to have one, and never &s;hall, I
believe; for I am &s;ure I will not contend with
a hu&s;band.</P>
<P>I have told Mrs. Vere what my mother
&s;aid to me; &s;he is entirely of her mind;
every body is combined again&s;t me; I am
treated like a baby, that knows not what is
fit for it to chu&s;e, or to reject.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 15.&mdash;I have been &s;earching
my heart, my dear Cecilia, to try if there
remained a lurking particle of my former
flame unextingui&s;hed; a flame I call it, as
we are allowed the metaphor, but it never
ro&s;e to <HI>that;</HI> it was but a &s;ingle ray, a gen|tle
glow that ju&s;t warmed my brea&s;t without
&s;corching: what it might have ari&s;en to, I
will not &s;ay; but I have the &s;atisfaction to
<PB N="148" REF="150">
find that the &s;hort-lived fire is quite extinct,
and the man&s;ion is even chilled with cold.</P>
<P>This was a very nece&s;&s;ary &s;crutiny, before
I would even entertain a thought of Mr. Ar|nold;
and, believe me, had I found it other|wi&s;e
than I &s;ay, I would rather have hazard|ed
my mother's di&s;plea&s;ure by owning the
truth to her, than injure any man, by giving
him my hand with an e&s;tranged heart.</P>
<P>I will acknowledge to you, my &s;i&s;ter, that
it was not without a &s;truggle I reduced my
mind to this frame. My heart (fooli&s;h thing)
indu&s;trious to perplex it&s;elf, would fain have
&s;ugge&s;ted &s;ome palliating circum&s;tances in
Mr. Faulkland's favour; but I forbid it to
interpo&s;e. Trifler, &s;aid I, let your guardian,
your proper guide, judge and determine for
you in this important cau&s;e, whereon &s;o
much of your future peace depends. It
&s;ighed, but had the virtue to &s;ubmit; and I
arraigned Faulkland before a little tribunal
in my brea&s;t, where I would &s;uffer rea&s;on
only to pre&s;ide. The little felon, love,
knocked at the door once or twice, but
ju&s;tice kept him out; and after a long (and
I think a fair) tryal, he was at length ca&s;t;
and in order to &s;trengthen my re&s;olves, and
ju&s;tify my mother's, as well as my own con|duct,
the&s;e are the arguments which I have
deduced from the evidences again&s;t him.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="151">
If Mr. Faulkland &s;eared the frailty of his
virtue, why did he not fly when he was fir&s;t
alarmed with the knowledge of the lady's
pa&s;&s;ion for him? If not for his own &s;ake, yet
at lea&s;t for her's. If he could not return
her love, was he not cruel in &s;uffering her to
feed a hopele&s;s flame? But &s;ince his evil fate
urged him on, and the unhappy girl lo&s;t her
honour, was he not bound to repair it? He
had never &s;een me at that time, was under
no per&s;onal engagements to me, and might
ea&s;ily have acquitted him&s;elf to my brother,
from &s;o ju&s;tifiable a motive.</P>
<P>What if I had married him, ignorant of
this &s;ecret, and it had afterwards come to
my ears, how mi&s;erable would it have made
me, to think that I had &s;tood between an
unfortunate young creature and her happi|ne&s;s?
For had Mr. Faulkland never heard
of me, had he not been prejudiced in my
favour, this young woman's beauty and in|nocence
(which he acknowledges) might have
then engaged his hone&s;t vows; the wicked
aunt would not have been tempted to betray
her tru&s;t, nor he (&s;hocking thought! when|ever
it recurs) to buy that favour he might
have obtained on virtuous terms. His prior
engagements to my brother was the fatal
plea that undid them both! Had he not been
furni&s;hed with this excu&s;e, her hopes might
have &s;upported her virtue; or, if ignorant
<PB N="150" REF="152">
of this, &s;he fell, what pretence could he offer,
after the injury <HI>was</HI> done, for not fulfilling an
obligation of &s;o much more importance? I
could not have &s;uffered by not obtaining a
man I never &s;aw; Mi&s;s B. is undone by lo|&s;ing
him: yet his word to Sir George, the
breach of which could have been attended
with no ill con&s;equence, was to be preferred
to an act of ju&s;tice. This is that fal&s;e ho|nour
upon which the men pique them&s;elves
&s;o much. An innocent child &s;tigmatized;
an amiable woman abandoned to &s;hame and
grief! I thank Heaven I made not my&s;elf
acce&s;&s;ary to this. <HI>Had</HI> I married Mr. Faulk|land,
<HI>knowing</HI> his fault, I could not &s;ay &s;o,
nor have blamed any thing but my own im|prudence,
If <HI>I</HI> in my turn found my&s;elf de|&s;erted.
Who knows but he might (after
having bound me in chains,) return to his
neglected mi&s;tre&s;s; and <HI>that</HI> love, which,
when it would have been meritorious in him,
he di&s;reli&s;hed, he might have pur&s;ued with
eagerne&s;s when interdicted. This might
have been the ca&s;e. I believe you may re|member
an in&s;tance of it among our ac|quaintance.
Mr. Saunders who refu&s;ed a
young lady for his bride, from an ab&s;olute
di&s;like of her per&s;on, took uncommon pains
to debauch her when &s;he became the wife of
his friend. Had Mr. Faulkland &s;o behaved,
what a wretch would it have made me! you
<PB N="151" REF="153">
know I have not a grain of jealou&s;y in my
compo&s;ition, yet I am &s;ure a neglect of this
kind would make me very mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>You have not forgot, I believe, that about
two years ago there was a match propo&s;ed
to my mother by the bi&s;hop of B. between
me and his nephew. The young man was
heir to a good fortune, was reckoned hand|&s;ome
and accompli&s;hed, and I think he real|ly
was &s;o: I was entirely free from prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions
in favour of any one, and had no
objection to him, but that I knew he had a
mo&s;t lamentably-vulnerable heart, for he had
been in love with two or three women of my
acquaintance. My mother mentioned him
to me upon the good old prelate's recom|mendation,
and I gave her this as my rea|&s;on
for di&s;liking the offer, which &s;he ap|proved
of &s;o intirely, that the thing went
no farther. Indeed I think that woman is a
fool, who ri&s;ques her contentment with one
of a light di&s;po&s;ition. Marriage will not
change men's natures; and it is not every
one who has virtue or prudence enough to
be reclaimed. Upon the whole, I am &s;atis|fied
with my lot; and am &s;ure I could hear
with plea&s;ure, that Mr. Faulkland was mar|ried
to that Mi&s;s B. I wi&s;h I knew the other
letters that compo&s;e her name.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 16.&mdash;My mother a&s;ked
me to-day, had I con&s;idered of what &s;he
<PB N="152" REF="154">
had been &s;aying to me? I told her I had, and
only begged a little more time. She ki&s;&s;ed
me, with tears in her eyes. To be &s;ure, my
dear, as much as you can rea&s;onably de&s;ire.
I know my Sidney is above trifling. Mrs.
Vere was pre&s;ent when my mother left the
room. Oh! Mi&s;s Bidulph, &s;aid &s;he, who
would refu&s;e to gratify &s;uch a parent as that?
Had <HI>my</HI> mother conde&s;cended to treat me &s;o,
I am &s;ure &s;he could have wrought on me to
do any thing &s;he liked, even though it had
been repugnant to my inclination. Dear ma|dam,
I replied, how &s;weetly you inforce my
duty&mdash;Yes, I will obey that kinde&s;t be&s;t of
mothers. I believe I &s;poke this, tho' without
intending it, in a tone that implied &s;omething
like making a merit of this conce&s;&s;ion; for
Mrs. Vere immediately an&s;wered, There's a
good child! that to oblige its mama, will
accept of a very hand&s;ome young gentleman,
with a good e&s;tate, and one that many a girl
in England would give her eyes for. I felt
the rebuke; but turning it off with a &s;mile,
&s;aid, but you forget, my dear, that I am
not dying for him.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 20.&mdash;How will you plume
your&s;elf on your &s;agacity, Cecilia, when
you read this account of my love, which
you &s;o wi&s;ely foretold? I can tell you I am
trying to like Mr. Arnold as fa&s;t as I can; I
make him &s;ing and play for this purpo&s;e
<PB N="153" REF="155">
from morning 'till night, for he is here every
day, and all day. Lady Grim&s;ton holds
her head a quarter of a yard higher than &s;he
did before; and looks, as who &s;hould &s;ay,
it was <HI>I</HI> that brought this about. The dean
is as frolick as May-day upon it; for he is
very fond of Mr. Arnold; but tells him he
will not forgive him for robbing him of his
&s;econd wife; for &s;uch, he &s;ays, he intended
me. I think his daughter (a pretty girl of
about &s;eventeen) looks a little grave of late.
I hope &s;he does not like Mr. Arnold her&s;elf.
I wi&s;h my mother would take it into her
head that &s;he was in love with him, and that
Mr. Arnold had promi&s;ed to marry her;
then &s;hould I a &s;econd time crown me with
a willow garland. But there is no fear of
this, or rather no hope.</P>
<P>Lady Grim&s;ton has given my mother <HI>&s;uch</HI>
a character of Mr. Arnold, that if you will
take her word for it, there is not a man like
him in the world; and my mother firmly
believes every &s;yllable &s;he &s;ays. She told
me to-day &s;he would write to Sir George, to
give him an account of the matter, and de|&s;ire
his advice. This is a compliment &s;he
would not omit paying, for any con&s;iderati|on,
tho' I know my brother's judgment has
now lo&s;t all credit with her; and that, let his
opinion be what it will, &s;he is firmly re|&s;olved
on her new plan. Knowing as you
<PB N="154" REF="156">
do my mother's firmne&s;s, when once &s;he is
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a thing, you would not won|der
that I did not make attempts to alter her
mind, which I knew would be fruitle&s;s. She
likes Mr. Arnold prodigiou&s;ly; &s;he piques
her&s;elf on her &s;kill in phy&s;iognomy, and &s;ays,
if &s;he is deceived in this Gentleman, &s;he will
never again rely on this &s;cience. Lady Grim|&s;ton
is &s;o fond of him, that I wonder &s;he did
not marry him her&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 23.&mdash;We have received
two letters from Sir George; one in an&s;wer
to my mother's, the other to me. I will
give them both to you: the following is a
copy of that to my mother:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I thank you for the honour you do me in
a&s;king my advice, in regard to the propo&s;al
of marriage you have received for my &s;i&s;ter;
but I am entirely di&s;qualified from giving
you any, as I am an ab&s;olute &s;tranger both
to the per&s;on and character of the gentleman
you mention; and know no more of him,
than that I have heard there is &s;uch a per&s;on,
who has &s;ome e&s;tate in the county where you
are.</P>
<P>As you are ab&s;olute mi&s;tre&s;s of your
daughter's will, as well of her per&s;on, I &s;hall
not pre&s;ume to interfere in this nice point.
If the marriage is not <HI>already</HI> agreed upon
(which may be the ca&s;e, notwith&s;tanding the
<PB N="155" REF="157">
compliment you do me the favour to pay
me,) I think it would be generous in you to
&s;ee Mi&s;s B. and hear what &s;he has to &s;ay, be|fore
you proceed farther; but in this, as in
every thing el&s;e, your own di&s;cretion mu&s;t
guide you.</P>

<P>My mother was exceedingly di&s;plea&s;ed
with this Letter. She &s;aid Sir George had a
haughtine&s;s in him that was very offen&s;ive to
her. I have acquitted my&s;elf in applying
to him, and &s;hall give my&s;elf no farther
trouble about him, or his opinion. As for
Mi&s;s B. I think &s;he can hardly be under a
nece&s;&s;ity of coming to town as yet, and that
affair may keep cold, for I have but little
curio&s;ity to hear what the poor &s;oul may be
prompted to &s;ay, as I am &s;ure I &s;hall be time
enough to afford her any a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;he may
&s;tand in need of. This was the whole of
her ob&s;ervation. My brother's letter to me
is as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>Dear Sidney,</OPENER>
<P>I received with concern (though I own not with
&s;urprize) an account from my mother,
of a new treaty of marriage that is on foot
<PB N="156" REF="158">
between you and a Mr. Arnold, of whom I
know nothing. In&s;tead of congratulating
you on this occa&s;ion, I cannot help con|doling
with you; for I have a better opinion
of your heart than to &s;uppo&s;e it can have &s;o
&s;oon renounced poor Faulkland. I do not re|proach
you for your acquie&s;cence in giving
him up, I <HI>know</HI> you could not do otherwi&s;e;
but why in the name of precipitancy, are you
to be hurried into wedlock already? You went
into the country to recover your health, I
thought; prithee how comes this new hu&s;|band
into your way? I know, child, it is
not of your &s;eeking, and do from my heart
pity you.</P>
<P>I would by no means have you guilty of a
breach of duty to our mother; but for Hea|ven's
&s;ake, why don't you try your influ|ence
over her, to have this &s;udden &s;cheme of
matrimony &s;u&s;pended, 'till &s;he &s;ees and
talks to this girl that Faulkland refers her to?
If the wench owns that he was not to blame
&s;o much as &s;he her&s;elf was, and relinqui&s;hes
all preten&s;ions to him, don't you think &s;he
(my mother I mean) would, in that ca&s;e, re|main
bound in honour to yield you to his
prior claim?</P>
<P>Indeed, Sidney, I mu&s;t blame you for
this part of your conduct; it looks like a
&s;trange in&s;en&s;ibility in you.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="159">
I know you will urge a perfect &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion
to your mother's will; and I know too, that
<HI>will</HI> is as ab&s;olute as that of an Ea&s;tern mo|narch.
I therefore repeat it, I do not mean
to reproach you with your compliance, but
I am vexed to the heart, and mu&s;t give it
vent.</P>
<P>I &s;ee plainly that old piece of formality,
lady Grim&s;ton's infernal &s;hrivelled paw in all
this. For my Mother of her&s;elf, I am &s;ure,
would not have thought of di&s;po&s;ing of you,
without your liking, &s;o &s;oon after an affair
that had created you &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s, un|le&s;s
it had been &s;ugge&s;ted to her by &s;ome|body.
Prithee tell me what &s;ort of a man
this Arnold really is, for I do not depend on
the partial repre&s;entations I have had of him.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h Mi&s;s B. was come to town, but &s;he
is not yet arrived. I enquired for her of Mr.
Faulkland's hou&s;ekeeper, by the name of
Jefferis. The woman is at the hou&s;e at Put|ney
waiting to receive her, but does not
know how &s;oon &s;he will come. Would &s;he
had been buried before Faulkland &s;aw her!</P>
<P>I &s;hall expect a letter from you &s;oon.
How comes it that you never mentioned Mr.
Arnold to me in any that you have writ? But
I excu&s;e you, and am</P>

<P><PB N="158" REF="160">
You &s;ee this is Sir George him&s;elf, my
dear, a mixture of petulancy and indelicacy.
There is one thing in him, however, com|mendable;
his &s;teady adherence to his
friend's intere&s;ts. You find how impo&s;&s;ible
for me it is to &s;hew &s;uch a letter to my mo|ther:
by his &s;trange unguarded manner of
writing, which he does not con&s;ider, he
defeats his own purpo&s;es; for if any u&s;e
could be made of that part of his letter re|lative
to Mi&s;s B. I could not &s;hew my mo|ther
part, without letting her &s;ee the whole:
but that is not to be done; and I can only
thank my good fortune that I received this,
and the la&s;t letter from him, without her
knowledge.</P>
<P>I will now give you my an&s;wer to this
letter, which I wrote, by the return of the
po&s;t.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>Dear Brother,</OPENER>
<P>I thank you for your condolements, but
can a&s;&s;ure you my heart is not in &s;uch a &s;i|tuation
as to require any. I own I had all
the e&s;teem for Mr. Faulkland, which I
thought his merit de&s;erved. Duty to my
good mother, and an undeniable blemi&s;h
in his character, fir&s;t wrought a change in
my &s;entiments towards him: my own peace
of mind now requires me to improve that
change into indifference.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="161">
You do me ju&s;tice in &s;uppo&s;ing that I
&s;hould never think of &s;eeking a hu&s;band;
and you have formed as right a judgment
in regard to lady Grim&s;ton's being the pro|moter
of this union. As for Mr. Ar|nold,
though perhaps (had I never known
your friend) he might not have been the
man of my choice, yet have I no di&s;like to
him. I believe him to be a very worthy
gentleman; and that my mother has not
been partial in her repre&s;entations. I am
&s;ure, at lea&s;t, &s;he has &s;aid nothing of him
but what &s;he has &s;een, or been told, and
has good rea&s;on to believe.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h, dear brother, you had writ with
more caution, that I might have laid before
my mother what you &s;aid in relation to Mi&s;s
B. It may have its weight with me, though
I cannot an&s;wer for its having any with her.
Do you forget her having told me, that &s;he
conceived a &s;ort of horror at the thoughts
of my marrying Mr. Faulkland? She can|not
but be &s;en&s;ible, that Mi&s;s B. is not with|out
her &s;hare of blame in that affair, which
has &s;o perplexed us all. But you know too
that does not exculpate Mr. Faulkland.
The young lady's relinqui&s;hing her hopes
(for a claim I think &s;he does not make),
would only the more excite my mother's
compa&s;&s;ion, and intere&s;t her in her favour.
To &s;um up the whole in one word, my mo|ther
<PB N="160" REF="162">
is re&s;olved, and you your&s;elf acknow|ledge
that her will is ab&s;olute. She has
u&s;ed the mo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible argument to ob|tain
my con&s;ent, <HI>viz.</HI> that it would make
<HI>her</HI> happy. Spare then, my dear brother,
unkind reflections on any part of my beha|viour;
for I am determined to pur&s;ue,
through life, that rule of conduct, which I
have hitherto invariably adhered to; I mean
that of preferring to my own the hap|pine&s;s
of tho&s;e who are mo&s;t dear to me.</P>
<CLOSER>I am, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><HI>September</HI> 25.&mdash;Mr. Arnold has &s;o ma|ny
advocates here, that his intere&s;t cannot
fail of being promoted. Mrs. Vere ad|mires
him; the Dean commends him; my
mother prai&s;es him; lady Grim&s;ton extols
him to the &s;kies. No one is &s;ilent, but the
young girl that I mentioned to you before;
&s;he only colours and hangs down her head
when he is &s;poken of. I really begin to
fear that the poor thing loves him; but he
never made any addre&s;&s;es to her, and I
hope does not &s;u&s;pect it.</P>
<P>Things are now gone &s;o far, that my
mother and lady Grim&s;ton talked to day of
&s;ettlements. Mr. Arnold receives but twelve
hundred pounds a year from his e&s;tate: his
brother's widow, as I have already told you,
having a jointure upon it of three hundred
pounds a year. She lives entirely in Lon|don,
<PB N="161" REF="163">
and is, I am told, a very imprudent
woman, and not all e&s;teemed by the family.
The elder Mr. Arnold and &s;he were married
&s;everal years, but never had a child; the
la&s;t two years of his life his wife and he lived
&s;eparate, her conduct having given room
for &s;ome &s;u&s;picions, very injurious to her
hu&s;band's honour.</P>
<P>The Arnold e&s;tate was originally a very
con&s;iderable one, but has been di&s;&s;ipated by
the extravagance of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors.
What remains, however, is quite clear,
and is likely to be kept &s;o by the good ma|nagement
of the pre&s;ent owner. His late
brother was exceedingly remi&s;s in his affairs,
and &s;pent mo&s;t of his time in London; and
if it had not been for Mr. Arnold, the
man&s;ion-hou&s;e would have fallen to the
ground; but his brother lent it to him, and
he kept it in repair for his own u&s;e, as he is
fond of the place: though he has a pretty
hou&s;e in Kent, belonging to another e&s;tate
of about three hundred pounds a year, which
came to him by his mother, for he is the &s;on
of a &s;econd marriage. And this, 'till his
brother's death, was the whole of his income;
but he is &s;o good an oeconomi&s;t, that he al|ways
made a genteeler figure on his three
hundred pounds a year, than his brother
did in twelve.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="164">
My mother, who you know is integrity
it&s;elf, thinks that I ought not to have more
&s;ettled on me than the widow of Mr. Ar|nold's
brother had, who&s;e fortune was &s;u|perior
to mine. Mr. Arnold makes a much
hand&s;omer propo&s;al; lady Grim&s;ton is for
laying hold of it. The Dean was for &s;trike|ing
a medium. I do not care how they
&s;ettle it; but I fancy my mother will have
her own way in this.</P>
<P>She purpo&s;es going to town next week,
that the wedding&mdash;(ble&s;s me! who&s;e wed|ding
is it that I am talking of &s;o coolly?)
well&mdash;that it may be celebrated in her own
hou&s;e. This to be &s;ure will &s;end Sir George
directly out of it. I cannot help it; I am
born to give, and to receive vexation.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnold &s;peaks of taking a hou&s;e in
London, where my mother is to have an
apartment whenever &s;he chu&s;es to be in
town. This is a plea&s;ing circum&s;tance to
me; and &s;he likewi&s;e propo&s;es our being
&s;ometimes with her at Sidney-ca&s;tle. That
is a pro&s;pect which lo&s;es much of its charms,
by the reflection that my dear Cecilia is not
there.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 1.&mdash;All preliminaries are &s;et|tled.
There has been a fu&s;s with parch|ments
this week pa&s;t. My mother has car|ried
her point, in regard to the jointure;
and has made choice of that little e&s;tate in
<PB N="163" REF="165">
Kent to be &s;ettled on me, as it is a complete
three hundred pounds a year, detached en|tirely
from the re&s;t, and has a pretty hou&s;e
on it. This was all &s;he would accept of,
though, to do Mr. Arnold ju&s;tice, he would
have been much more liberal; but, my mo|ther
&s;ays, a &s;ingle woman, bred in retire|men
as I have been, who cannot live on that,
does not de&s;erve to live at all; adding, that
the e&s;tate was already &s;ubject to one jointure,
and the widow &s;o young a woman; if it
&s;hould be al&s;o my misfortune to become one
early, a great part of the fortune would be
&s;wallowed by dowagers, and the heir not have
enough to &s;upport his rank.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 2.&mdash;This morning my mother,
lady Grim&s;ton, the Dean, and Mr. Arnold
(who is the idol of them all) took a rum|bling
together in the old coach, by way of
taking the air, in a du&s;ty road; and what
do you think was the re&s;ult of their delibe|rations
in this jaunt? Why truly lady Grim|&s;ton,
proud of her handy work, would
needs &s;ee it accompli&s;hed; and nothing will
&s;erve her, but I mu&s;t be married at her
hou&s;e. My mother oppo&s;ed it at fir&s;t; but
the Dean &s;econded the propo&s;al, that he
might have (as he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf) the
&s;atisfaction of contributing <HI>him&s;elf</HI> to make
Mr. Arnold happy; and Mr. Arnold (au|daciou&s;ly
<PB N="164" REF="166">
expecting, I &s;uppo&s;e, that this
would ha&s;ten the ceremony) joined his in|treaties
&s;o effectually, that my mother was
obliged to yield.</P>
<P>What a tormenting old woman is this la|dy
Grim&s;ton! I hoped, at lea&s;t, for the re|&s;pite
of a month, by getting to London. I
thought fir&s;t to have delayed the time of
our going to town, and then to have &s;addled
away a while longer under pretence of pre|parations;
though there is but little room
for that now, as all my fineries, de&s;tined I
thought to another purpo&s;e, are lying quietly
in my trunks at home. But then one
might have contrived many little occa&s;ions
of delay. There was a hou&s;e to be fixed
upon, and I had twenty things to do, and,
as my mother &s;ays, many things fall out
between the cup and the lip. But all my
expectations are blown away, and I have
but one poor fortnight given me to recollect
my &s;cattered thoughts, when they are
all to be centered in Mr. Arnold. I am
not merry, my Cecilia, but I am determin|ed
not to appear &s;ad; neither am I &s;o; I
hope I have no rea&s;on.</P>
<P>My mother purpo&s;es writing again to Sir
George, to de&s;ire his pre&s;ence at my mar|riage.
I hope he will behave re&s;pectfully
to every one here, if he &s;hould come.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="167">
<HI>October</HI> 5.&mdash;Mr. Arnold has writ to
town, to be&s;peak a new chariot; he will
do nothing in regard to the hou&s;e, 'till I
am on the &s;pot to plea&s;e my&s;elf. I intend
&s;ending Patty to town, to bring me down
my bridal trappings.</P>

was obliged to leave the church, which has
confirmed me in my &s;u&s;picions&mdash;Oh! how I

illne&s;s for an excu&s;e to retire. Mrs. Vere
went out with her; but &s;he would not &s;uf|fer
her to attend her home. She promi&s;ed
to dine with us, if &s;he &s;hould be better; and
&s;o &s;he did, and &s;eemed chearful and pretty

&s;he is exceedingly lively, and, I dare &s;ay,

<P>Lady Grim&s;ton was downright tire&s;ome
with her compliments: and preached an
hour long about the duty of children to
their parents; and how good a wife that
woman was likely to make, who had al|ways
been exemplary in her filial obedience.
Ah! lady Grim&s;ton, thought I, by what I
have heard of you, you did not &s;eem to
number obedience among&s;t wife-like virtues
in your own ca&s;e, though you can preach it
up to others. But I knew this &s;ermon was
chiefly intended for poor Mrs. Vere's u&s;e. My
mother was all kindne&s;s and complacency.
She &s;eemed &s;o delighted, that I rejoiced in
having had it in my power to give her &s;o
much happine&s;s. Lady Grim&s;ton did the
honours of her hou&s;e on this occa&s;ion with
great magnificence, and I believe I need
not tell you, with mo&s;t exqui&s;ite decorum.
Indeed this wedding was conducted with
&s;uch a decent fe&s;tivity, &s;o rationally on all

Dean, his lady and daughter, one young
lady more, and a relation of Mr. Arnold's;
a gentleman who came from London on
<PB N="169" REF="171">
purpo&s;e to be pre&s;ent on this (as it is called)
joyful occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>We &s;hall leave this hou&s;e to-morrow, Mr.
Arnold and I, I mean. I am to be put in|to
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the old man&s;ion of Arnold-abbey.
My mother is to continue with lady
Grim&s;ton a week or a fortnight longer, and
then &s;he goes to London on no other call, as
&s;he &s;ays, but to &s;ee and admini&s;ter comfort
to poor Mi&s;s B. who &s;he &s;uppo&s;es will be by
that time come to her retreat.</P>
<P>I believe I &s;hall remain in the country
while the weather continues plea&s;ant, but am
not yet determined.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 17.&mdash;We took leave of lady
Grim&s;ton this morning, or rather of her
hou&s;e; for her lady&s;hip, my dear mother,
and all the good folks that were our gue&s;ts
at Grim&s;ton-hall, are to dine with us to-day
at Arnold-abbey. I de&s;ired I might be per|mitted
to go home without any parade&punc; and
in as private a manner as po&s;&s;ible; for you
know how I hate a bu&s;tle. Mr. Arnold very
obligingly indulged me in this reque&s;t, and
conducted my &s;weet Mrs. Vere and me home
in his own coach, at eight of the clock this
morning. I found every thing in exact order
at Arnold-abbey. The hou&s;e is very &s;pa|cious
and convenient, though very old-fa&s;hioned.
Some of the rooms however are
newly fitted up, perfectly neat and hand&s;ome.
<PB N="170" REF="172">
The &s;ervants are orderly and well-behaved,
and every thing &s;eems to be exactly well re|gulated.
You may be &s;ure I have taken my
own Patty home with me; I intend to con|&s;titute
her hou&s;e-keeper, and give her an ad|ditional
&s;alary for her additional trouble.
Mr. Arnold had nobody in that capacity be|fore,
as his hou&s;ehold had not been &s;ettled
&s;ince the acqui&s;ition of his fortune, and he
re&s;erved the chu&s;ing of &s;o material a dome&s;|tic
to me; but as I do not love to multiply
&s;ervants, and know that Patty is very capable
of the place, I &s;hall take no other.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 21.&mdash;Vi&s;itors &s;till in abundance:
all the gentry in the neighbourhood for
&s;ome miles about have been to pay us their
compliments; at lea&s;t, I hope by this time
they have <HI>all</HI> been here, for we have not
had a minute to our&s;elves the&s;e three days.
It will make me up ten to return them, as
many of the families live at a good di&s;tance
from hence.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnold, who&s;e mourning has been
laid a&s;ide &s;ince our wedding-day, &s;eems to
have a very good ta&s;te in dre&s;s; he is per|fectly
well &s;haped, and appears to great ad|vantage
in colours; in &s;hort, he is more ami|able
than I thought he was. It is with great
plea&s;ure that I ob&s;erve my young acquaint|ance,
on who&s;e heart I feared Mr. Arnold
had made an impre&s;&s;ion, has recovered her
<PB N="171" REF="173">
u&s;ual vivacity. With people extremely full
of &s;pirits, love is not apt to &s;ink very deep,
or la&s;t long, when it does not meet with a
return.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 30.&mdash;My mother &s;ets out for
London to-morrow, and Mr. Arnold has
propo&s;ed to me, that he and I &s;hould ac|company
her. He &s;ays, he wants to look
out for a hou&s;e, and &s;hould like to fix in one
before the winter advances; and that we may
take up our abode at my mother's 'till our
hou&s;e is ready for us. My mother is charm|ed
at this propo&s;al: &s;he dreads the thoughts
of parting with me; and as &s;he intends go|ing
(after a convenient &s;tay in London) down
to Sidney-ca&s;tle, if I remain here, our &s;epa|ration
mu&s;t be immediate. I know this is
Mr. Arnold's kind rea&s;on for de&s;iring me to
go; he thinks I &s;hall be le&s;s affected at part|ing
with my mother, when in the mid&s;t of
the various &s;cenes which London affords,
than I &s;hould be if I were to continue here.
He gives not this for a rea&s;on, but I know it
is his true one; for he is not fond of Lon|don
him&s;elf, e&s;pecially at a &s;ea&s;on of the
year, when the country is &s;o much more
agreeable. I thanked him for this mark
of his tenderne&s;s, and am determined to
go.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 31.&mdash;Once more returned
to London in very good &s;pirits, after a
<PB N="172" REF="174">
&s;tay of little more than two months in
E&s;&s;ex, in which time &s;o material and un|expected
a change has been made in my
condition.</P>
<P>Lady Grim&s;ton took a mo&s;t affectionate
leave of my mother, and a&s;ked her, with
more tenderne&s;s than I thought her capable
of, How many ages it would be before they
&s;hould meet again? As for Mr. Arnold and
me, &s;he con&s;iders us as her neighbours.
The Dean plea&s;es him&s;elf with that expec|tation
too; and the dear Mrs. Vere, who
&s;hed tears at bidding me adieu, promi&s;es
her&s;elf the happine&s;s (as &s;he kindly expre&s;&s;ed
her&s;elf) of &s;pending many delightful days
with me next &s;ummer. She &s;et out on her
return to her own hou&s;e, at the &s;ame time
that we left ours to go to town.</P>
<P>My brother is &s;till in Wilt&s;hire; but I
find he did not leave town at the time he
mentioned in his letter to my mother, nor
for &s;ome days after. This Patty learnt from
the &s;ervants; but I hope it will not come to
my mother's ears, for &s;he would take it ex|tremely
ill of him.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnold, for the fir&s;t time, mention|ed,
that he was very much di&s;appointed in
not having had the honour of &s;eeing Sir
George at his hou&s;e in the country; but
he hoped, when he came to town, his
brother and he &s;hould make up for this,
<PB N="173" REF="175">
by being the more together. I wi&s;h Sir
George may behave as he ought to this de|&s;erving
brother. Mr. Arnold little ima|gines
how much he was an enemy to the
match, and much le&s;s his rea&s;on for it. I
&s;hould be very &s;orry Mr. Arnold were to
know how near I was being married to ano|ther
man; it might give a delicate mind
pain, le&s;t there &s;hould remain any traces of
this former attachment in the brea&s;t of the
woman he loves; but I hope there is no
danger of his hearing of it, certainly no
one would be &s;o indi&s;creet as to mention it
to him. Mr. Arnold has lived chiefly in
the country, and may never have heard of
Mr. Faulkland, as he was &s;o &s;hort a time
returned from his travels, on which he had
been ab&s;ent more than five years; and as he
is now out of the kingdom, probably he
will not be &s;poken of. I have begged of
my mother, who is naturally communicative,
never to name Mr. Faulkland to Mr. Ar|nold,
and have given my rea&s;ons for de&s;iring
this. She &s;ays, &s;he thinks it would be better
to tell him the whole affair at once; but I
cannot agree with her in that opinion; and
have at la&s;t prevailed on her to promi&s;e me
&s;he will not &s;peak of it.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 2.&mdash;My mother drove out
in my new chariot to-day (a very fine gay
one it is), and went to Putney, to enquire
<PB N="174" REF="176">
after Mi&s;s B. by the name of Mrs. Jefferis.
She &s;oon found the hou&s;e, a very neat box,
with a pretty garden behind it. The door
was opened by a &s;ervant maid; and my mo|ther
being told the lady was at home, &s;ent
in her name; and was immediately con|ducted
up &s;tairs into a very elegant little
dre&s;&s;ing-room, where the lady was &s;itting at
her toilet; and Mr. Faulkland's hou&s;ekeeper
(whom my mother had &s;een before) a&s;&s;i&s;ting
to dre&s;s her head. On my mother's entering
the room, Mi&s;s B. ro&s;e off her chair, and
&s;oon di&s;covered by her &s;hape (for &s;he was
without her &s;tays), that it was high time for
her to &s;eek a place of concealment. The
hou&s;ekeeper immediately withdrew; and the
young lady &s;eemed in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion;
my mother &s;ays, &s;he her&s;elf was at a lo&s;s
how to begin the conver&s;ation, but Mi&s;s B.
relieved her, and &s;poke fir&s;t. She thanked
her for the honour &s;he did her by &s;o cha|ritable
a vi&s;it, which, &s;he &s;aid, Mr. Faulk|land
had long ago made her hope for;
and which &s;he mu&s;t con&s;ider as the greate&s;t
con&s;olation in her pre&s;ent unhappy circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>My mother placed her&s;elf by her. Ma|dam,
&s;aid &s;he, Mr. Faulkland made it a
point with me before he left England, that
I &s;hould &s;ee you, and afford you all the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance
in my power, or that you &s;hould &s;tand
<PB N="175" REF="177">
in $span$ or. You &s;eem to be commodiou&s;ly
&s;ituated here, and I under&s;tand have a very
careful good woman to attend you.</P>
<P>I have &s;o, madam, &s;he an&s;wered; but the
mo&s;t material circum&s;tance is wanting to my
relief: Mr. Faulkland!&mdash;He is not here.
Tears &s;tarted into her eyes as &s;he &s;poke. You
were appri&s;ed of his ab&s;ence, &s;aid my mother,
before you came to town. I was, madam, and
with the cau&s;e of it; &s;he hung down her head,
and was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>My mother rea&s;&s;umed the conver&s;ation.
She told her, &s;he thought it a mo&s;t provi|dential
di&s;covery, that had given her the
knowledge of Mr. Faulkland's ill behaviour,
time enough to prevent his marriage with
her daughter; a&s;&s;uring her, &s;he would not,
for the univer&s;e, have had me the wife of a
man under &s;uch ties, as &s;he mu&s;t con&s;ider
Mr. Faulkland to be. Mi&s;s B. brightened
up a little upon my mother's &s;aying this.
Did Mr. Faulkland ever tell you, madam,
how the unhappy affair happened? My mo|ther
told her, &s;he knew not particulars;
that &s;he had been referred to her for a full
explanation; that Mr. Faulkland had always
endeavoured to excu&s;e him&s;elf, and went &s;o
far as to &s;ay, He was &s;ure the lady her&s;elf
would acquit him in a great mea&s;ure. Ah!
madam! Mi&s;s B. cried, and &s;hook her head.
'Tis as I &s;u&s;pected, &s;aid my mother, Mr.
<PB N="176" REF="178">
Faulkland is an ungenerous man. A young
lady of your mode&s;t appearance, I am &s;ure
he mu&s;t have taken more pains to &s;educe,
than he will acknowledge. Mi&s;s B. blu&s;hed
exceedingly&mdash;Oh! madam, you have a
charitable, generous heart, I was <HI>indeed</HI> &s;e|duced.
I knew it, replied my mother.
Did he promi&s;e to marry you? She
coloured deeper than before. I will not
accu&s;e him of that, madam. My mother
proceeded; You have a relation, madam;
I under&s;tand &s;he was acce&s;&s;ary to your mis|fortune.
Yes, the barbarous woman, an|&s;wered
the lady, &s;he was the contriver of my
de&s;truction; and if I could have avoided it,
I would never have &s;een her face again.
Tears of grief and indignation again bur&s;t
from her eyes. Have comfort, madam, &s;aid
my mother, all may end well yet. I can
have no hopes, an&s;wered Mi&s;s B. Mr.
Faulkland flies me, you &s;ee, nor can I ever
expect to recover his heart, &s;ince &s;o charming
a young lady, as I hear Mi&s;s Bidulph is, has
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; and though your goodne&s;s
di&s;appointed him in his late views, he may
not yet de&s;pair. I found by this, continued
my mother, that Mi&s;s B. knew nothing of
your being married, and I made ha&s;te to tell
her. I never &s;aw joy &s;o vi&s;ible in a counte|nance.
She cla&s;ped her hands together;
Dear madam! what do you tell me? How
<PB N="177" REF="179">
you revive my drooping heart! then I am
not <HI>quite</HI> hopele&s;s, there is a <HI>po&s;&s;ibility</HI> in my
favour.</P>
<P>She then a&s;ked my mother if Mr. Faulk|land
had acquainted her with her real name,
or that of her relation. My mother, who
had once or twice called her by the name
of Jefferis, a&s;&s;ured her he had not. That
was generous in him, &s;aid &s;he; he <HI>can</HI> be
generous in <HI>&s;ome</HI> points. But I have no rea|&s;on
to conceal it from &s;o prudent and worthy
a lady as you are; my real name is Burchell;
that of my cruel relation I will forbear to
mention, out of re&s;pect to my good uncle,
who&s;e wife &s;he is. Mr. Faulkland, &s;he add|ed,
left a Bill of five hundred pounds with
his hou&s;e-keeper, to provide every thing for
me that I &s;hould want; with a&s;&s;urances that
he would take the tendere&s;t care of&mdash;
the poor young creature he&s;itated, and could
proceed no farther; but my mother &s;aid &s;he
under&s;tood her meaning. They had a good
deal more di&s;cour&s;e: my mother promi&s;ed
to &s;ee her often during her confinement, and
took her leave.</P>
<P>She tells me, &s;he is exceedingly pretty,
and has &s;uch an air of innocence and &s;im|plicity,
as very much engages one in her
favour.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="180">
I have &s;et down this whole conver&s;ation,
with every other particular, exactly as my
mother related it.</P>
<P>She, who has a mo&s;t circum&s;tantial memo|ry,
repeated it word for word; and I, from
a cu&s;tom of throwing upon paper every thing
that occurs to me, have habituated my&s;elf to
retain the minute&s;t things.</P>
<P>I know not, my dear, whether you will
be of my opinion; but I cannot help think|ing,
that there was &s;omething like art in Mi&s;s
Burchell's behaviour, far from that candour
which Mr. Faulkland &s;eemed to expect from
her. My mother mentioned the <HI>pains</HI> that
&s;he &s;uppo&s;ed had been taken to <HI>&s;educe</HI> her;
her deep blu&s;h at this hint, makes me &s;u&s;pect
that her an&s;wer was not dictated by &s;incerity.
She &s;aw my mother was not acquainted with
particulars, and that &s;he was willing to pa&s;s
a favourable judgment on her fault; it looks
to me as if &s;he laid hold of this prejudice&mdash;
and yet &s;he <HI>owned</HI> that Mr. Faulkland had
never promi&s;ed to marry her&mdash;I know not
what to think; but there appears to me,
upon the whole, &s;omething eva&s;ive and di&s;|ingenuous
in her conduct. My mother, who
is all openne&s;s and integrity, &s;aw it not in
this light. But be it as it may, it is no
longer of con&s;equence to me, which was
mo&s;t to blame, the gentleman or the lady:
Mi&s;s Burchell is certainly the injured Per&s;on;
<PB N="179" REF="181">
perhaps I too may have wronged her in my
&s;urmi&s;es; if I have, I beg her pardon; the
ob&s;ervations I have made on her behaviour
are only <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant,</HI> and I do from my heart
wi&s;h Mr. Faulkland would make her his
wife. You may perceive, from what I have
told you, how little this interview was like|ly
to produce in Mr. Faulkland's favour, had
it even been brought about &s;ooner. My
mother is now more than ever confirmed in
her opinion, that the poor young creature
has been deceived; and &s;he prays, that Mr.
Faulkland may not be overtaken with a judg|ment,
which &s;he thinks nothing but his mar|rying
the girl can avert.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 10.&mdash;We have at length
fixed upon a hou&s;e to our liking, a hand&s;ome
convenient one in St. James's-&s;treet. We
are preparing to get it furni&s;hed as fa&s;t as we
can, that we may go into it; for if my bro|ther
&s;hould come to town, I know <HI>our</HI> being
with my mother will be an objection to his
lodging in her hou&s;e: this I &s;hould be
&s;orry for, as &s;he told him he might
make u&s;e of it while it remained in her
hands.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 15.&mdash;Thank my &s;tars! I have
got over the fatigue of receiving and paying
a &s;econd round of bridal vi&s;its, and I am
really &s;o tired of it, that, uninviting as the
&s;ea&s;on is, I could wi&s;h my&s;elf in quiet at
<PB N="180" REF="182">
Arnold-Abbey; but I cannot think of leave|ing
London while my mother continues in
it, and &s;he is now re&s;olved to do &s;o 'till
Mi&s;s Burchell, or rather, on this occa&s;ion,
Mrs. Jefferis, is brought to-bed. You can't
imagine how &s;ollicitous &s;he is about her;
every time &s;he &s;ees her &s;he &s;eems more and
more plea&s;ed with her. I am very glad it has
happened &s;o, for the poor young woman's &s;ake;
my mother is as warm in her attachments
as in her re&s;entments. She vi&s;its her almo&s;t
every &s;econd day; for the poor thing it &s;eems
is ill at pre&s;ent, and can't leave her chamber.
She tells me &s;he is extremely melancholy, and
&s;eems much to dread the approaching hour.
I greatly honour my good mother for her hu|manity
towards her: in her terrifying &s;itua|tion
&s;he mu&s;t want the tenderne&s;s of a well-bred
as well as a &s;en&s;ible friend; for it mu&s;t
be a melancholy thing, in &s;uch circum&s;tances,
to have no one about her but &s;ervants, and
tho&s;e &s;trangers too.</P>
<P>She told my mother, that her altered
looks, and frequent &s;ickne&s;&s;es, gave her
aunt (who was privy to the cau&s;e of it all)
a pretence for a&s;king her uncle's permi&s;&s;ion
for Mi&s;s to go to Bath, which &s;he told him
would do her more good than any thing.
He con&s;ented, and &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he was actu|ally
gone thither under the care of a lady,
whom her aunt named, who was really go|ing
<PB N="181" REF="183">
there in order to &s;ettle for life, and to who&s;e
hou&s;e &s;he went for a day or two to give a co|lour
to this &s;tory. Her aunt contrived that &s;he
&s;hould not take any &s;ervant with her; give|ing
it for a rea&s;on, that as &s;he might be as
well attended by the lady's &s;ervants with
whom &s;he lodged, and be con&s;idered by her
as one of the family, a maid would only
be an unnece&s;&s;ary incumbrance. She added,
that her uncle was &s;o afflicted with the gout,
that he never &s;tirred abroad, and &s;aw very
little company, &s;o that it was not likely he
&s;hould ever be undeceived.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 20.&mdash;We have ju&s;t re|ceived
a very odd piece of news, that I own
has a little alarmed me. It is, that the wi|dow
of Mr. Arnold's brother is found to be
with child. There was no mention of this
at the time her hu&s;band died, nor indeed
any cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect it; but the &s;tronge&s;t
pre&s;umptions in the world to the contrary,
as her hu&s;band and &s;he lived a-part. It has
not been even whi&s;pered, 'till &s;ince our ar|rival
in town. The lady pretends that &s;he
was not con&s;cious of it her&s;elf 'till within
this fortnight; yet her hu&s;band has been
dead four months. This I am told is very
po&s;&s;ible, though not very common. She
has her&s;elf wrote a letter to Mr. Arnold, to
inform him of it; at the &s;ame time de|claring,
that &s;he and her late hu&s;band had
<PB N="182" REF="184">
been reconciled a little before his death;
and that, had he recovered, &s;he was to have
lived with him again. All this is very &s;trange.
The elder Mr. Arnold killed him&s;elf with
exce&s;&s;ive drinking. His death approached
him by &s;low degrees; but as he could never
be per&s;uaded to think it near, he took not
the lea&s;t care either of his &s;piritual or tem|poral
concerns. His brother was in the
country when he was &s;eized with his la&s;t
illne&s;s, which he had precipitated by &s;ome
extravagant exce&s;s. He was almo&s;t at the
la&s;t extremity before he could be prevailed
on to let a phy&s;ician attend him, or &s;uffer
his brother to be &s;ent for. In regard to the
latter, he told tho&s;e about him, that as he
was his heir, of cour&s;e he had made no will.
He mentioned not his wife. The jointure
which had been &s;ettled on her, he allowed
her for a &s;eparate maintenance. They had for
a long time pur&s;ued &s;eparate plea&s;ures, and
none of his friends knew that they had ever
met, or &s;o much as &s;een one another from
the time they parted. My Mr. Arnold ar|rived
in town ju&s;t time enough to clo&s;e his
brother's eyes; he was &s;peechle&s;s when he
came, and expired in le&s;s than an hour after
he entered his chamber.</P>
<P>As his wife had been very obnoxious to
the family, there was little notice taken of
<PB N="183" REF="185">
her by them, more than what common forms
require. She &s;eemed as indifferent about the
death of her hu&s;band, as &s;he had been to|wards
him in his life-time; and did not then
hint a word of this reconciliation between
them, or of her having had an interview
with him. I am told, &s;he is a very weak,
as well as a very loo&s;e woman; and Mr.
Arnold thinks &s;he has got into the hands of
&s;ome de&s;igning per&s;on. However that mat|ter
may be, it is a &s;erious affair; and he de|&s;igns
to take the opinion of an eminent law|yer
upon it. My poor dear mother is frightned
&s;adly. If this child &s;hould make its appear|ance
in the world time enough to prove
the po&s;&s;ibility of its being the offspring of the
late Mr. Arnold, &s;he &s;ays, it mu&s;t be con&s;i|dered
by the law as his heir, notwith&s;tanding
the hu&s;band and wife lived apart. Mr. Ar|nold
laughs, or affects to laugh at this; we
&s;hall, however, wait with patience 'till the
lady is brought to-bed.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 25.&mdash;Our hou&s;e is intirely
fitted up, and we &s;hall remove into it this
evening; my mother chu&s;es to continue in
her own, though Mr. Arnold pre&s;&s;es her to
accept of an apartment in ours; but we &s;hall
be near neighbours, and &s;he does not like to
change.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="186">
We have received the opinion of our
lawyers, who tell us, that in ca&s;e the child
&s;hould be born within &s;uch a period of time,
as to give colour to its claim, yet the lady
mu&s;t prove her a&s;&s;ertion, in regard to the
pretended meeting between her and her hu&s;|band;
which it is imagined is not in her
power to do; and her indifferent character,
together with &s;everal favourable circum|&s;tances
which Mr. Arnold has on his &s;ide,
makes them quite &s;anguine in their expec|tations
of overturning her claim. We are,
however, likely to be engaged in a di&s;agree|able
law-&s;uit; but as Mr. Arnold &s;eems per|fectly
ea&s;y about the i&s;&s;ue of it, I will make
my&s;elf &s;o too.</P>
<P><HI>December 10.</HI>&mdash;I am more and more
reconciled to my lot, my dear Cecilia, every
day that I live. Mr. Arnold's a&s;&s;iduity and
tenderne&s;s towards me de&s;erve the gratefulle&s;t
return my heart can make him; and I am
convinced it is not nece&s;&s;ary to be pa&s;&s;ionate|ly
in love with the man we marry, to make
us happy. Con&s;tancy, good &s;en&s;e, and a
&s;weet temper, mu&s;t form a ba&s;is for a dura|ble
felicity. The two latter I am &s;ure Mr.
Arnold po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es; Oh! may I never experi|ence
his want of the former! I hope my own
conduct will for ever en&s;ure to me his love.
That only can &s;ecure the tranquillity of my
future Days.</P>

<HI>December</HI> 11.&mdash;My brother arrived in
town la&s;t night; and came this morning in
company with my mother (and I am &s;ure at
her reque&s;t) to make us a formal vi&s;it. My
kind Mr. Arnold received him with tender|ne&s;s;
Sir George was coldly polite. He
owned, however, to my mother, upon her
a&s;king him his opinion of his brother-in-law,
that he &s;eemed to be a <HI>good clever &s;ort of a
fellow.</HI> I wi&s;h I could cultivate a friend&s;hip
between them; it will not be Mr. Arnold's
fault if there is not; but Sir George, you
know, is not of a very pliant di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>He a&s;ked my mother, when they were
alone, Whether &s;he had yet &s;een Mi&s;s B. or
Mrs. Jefferis (for he knew her by no other
name) and what &s;he had to &s;ay for her&s;elf?
My mother told him, he had better not touch
upon that &s;tring. I will be hanged, replied
Sir George, if the artful young baggage has
not impo&s;ed upon you. My mother, who
is always angry at having her &s;agacity called
in que&s;tion, told Sir George he was rude, and
&s;he &s;hould give him no &s;atisfaction on that
head. My brother an&s;wered, as it was <HI>now</HI>
of no con&s;equence, what the wench affirmed
or denied, he had no farther curio&s;ity about
her. My mother called him a bear, and &s;o
the enquiry ended.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="188">
<HI>December</HI> 20.&mdash;I congratulate you,
my &s;i&s;ter, my friend, my ever beloved Ce|cilia.
Happy! happy may you be in your
nuptials! but in the mid&s;t of my joy for
your being &s;o nobly and &s;o worthily be&s;tow|ed,
&s;elf-love forces a &s;igh from me. I have
lo&s;t the plea&s;ing hope of &s;eeing you, at the
time fixed for your return. The &s;tation your
hu&s;band holds at the court of Vienna, will,
I fear, long detain my beloved in a foreign
land. But you are not among&s;t &s;trangers;
a hu&s;band, a brother, and tender parent,
mu&s;t make every part of the globe equally
your home. I will therefore &s;eek for my
contentment in your's, and re&s;t &s;atisfied with
believing that you will always continue to
love me.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 10, 1703-4.&mdash;I begin to find
my thoughts &s;o much di&s;&s;ipated, that I am
angry with my&s;elf; Mr. Arnold's exce&s;&s;ive
indulgence will &s;poil me; he is always con|triving
new &s;cenes of plea&s;ure, and hurries
me from one to the other. I do not wi&s;h
to be perpetually fluttering about. The
calm dome&s;tic life you know was always my
choice; but I will not oppo&s;e my kind Mr.
Arnold in his fond de&s;ire of plea&s;ing me:
be&s;ides, I find that by his con&s;tantly gallant|ing
me to public places, he begins him&s;elf
to acquire a &s;ort of reli&s;h for them, which
he did not u&s;e to have; at lea&s;t his prudence
<PB N="187" REF="189">
made him &s;o to conform to the nece&s;&s;ity of
his circum&s;tances, while his fortune was
&s;mall, that he never indulged him&s;elf in
any of the fa&s;hionable expen&s;ive amu&s;ements;
nor does he now in any, but &s;uch as I par|take
of with him. I find he is by nature
open and liberal to exce&s;s. I mu&s;t take
care, without his being con&s;cious of it, to
be a gentle check upon his bounteous &s;pirit;
I mean only &s;o far as it regards my&s;elf: in|deed
this is the mo&s;t material point, for in
every other in&s;tance his genero&s;ity is regu|lated
by prudence. I am every hour more
obliged to him, and &s;hould hate my&s;elf if
I did not find that he had an entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of my love.</P>
<P>Sir George hardly ever comes near us but
by formal invitation, and then his behaviour
to Mr. Arnold is &s;o very civil, and &s;o very
di&s;tant, that it mortifies me exceedingly.
Mr. Arnold cannot but perceive it; but
either his tenderne&s;s for me makes him take
no notice of it, or el&s;e, not being well e|nough
acquainted with my brother to know
his di&s;po&s;ition, he may impute his coldne&s;s
to his natural temper.</P>
<P>My mother &s;ays, he never names Mr.
Faulkland or Mi&s;s Burchell to her. I wi&s;h
Sir George could entirely forget that unhap|py
affair.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="190">
<HI>February</HI> 1.&mdash;There is a &s;tory propa|gated
by the widow Arnold, about the meet|ing
between her and her hu&s;band; the cir|cum&s;tances
of which are as follows:</P>
<P>She &s;ays, &s;he had dined one day in the
city, and was returning home to her lodgings
in York-buildings in a hackney-coach; that
the driver, by his carele&s;&s;ne&s;s in coming
along the Strand, had one of his fore-wheels
taken off by a waggon, which accident
obliged her to alight: the footboy, who was
behind the coach, had by the jolt been
thrown off, and received a hurt, which
made it nece&s;&s;ary to have him carried into
a &s;hop for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. That the lady her&s;elf,
being no otherwi&s;e injured than by a little
fright, found that &s;he was &s;o near, home,
that &s;he did not think it worth while to wait
for another carriage, but pur&s;ued her way on
foot. It was a fine dry evening, about nine
o'clock; and though there was no light but
what the lamps afforded, yet as the &s;treets
were full of people, &s;he had no apprehen&s;ions
of danger.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation &s;he was acco&s;ted by two
gentlemen, who, &s;eeing a lady well dre&s;&s;ed
and alone; in&s;i&s;ted on &s;eeing her &s;afe to her
lodgings. However di&s;agreeable &s;uch an en|counter
was, &s;he &s;aid &s;he did not give her&s;elf
much concern about it, as &s;he was &s;o near
home, and expected to &s;hake off her new
<PB N="189" REF="191">
acquaintance at the door of the hou&s;e where
he lodged; and accordingly, when &s;he got
there, &s;he told them &s;he was at home, and
wi&s;hed them a good night; but the imper|tinents
were not &s;o ea&s;ily to be put off. The
door having been opened by the maid of the
hou&s;e, they both ru&s;hed in; her landlady, a
&s;ingle woman, happened to be abroad, and
there was no man in the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arnold thought &s;he had no way left,
but to run up to her dining-room, and lock
her&s;elf in; but in this &s;he was prevented, as
the gentlemen, whom the &s;ervant of the
hou&s;e vainly endeavoured to oppo&s;e, got up
&s;tairs almo&s;t as &s;oon as &s;he did. Her own
maid, on hearing the rap at the door, had
lighted candles in the dining-room; the two
&s;parks entered with her; but how was &s;he
&s;urprized to find that one of them was her
hu&s;band. Her fright, &s;he &s;aid, had pre|vented
her from di&s;covering this &s;ooner, as
&s;he had not looked in either of their faces,
though there was a light in the hall; and
Mr. Arnold's being half drunk, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed,
was the rea&s;on of his not perceiving &s;ooner
who &s;he was.</P>
<P>The a&s;toni&s;hment that they both were in,
and the exclamation that each made in their
turn, &s;oon informed the companion of Mr.
Arnold who the lady was. He congratu|lated
them both on this fortunate mi&s;take,
<PB N="190" REF="192">
and &s;aying, &s;ince chance had been &s;o pro|pitious
to Mr. Arnold as to throw him into
the arms of &s;o charming a woman, he
hoped his di&s;covering her to be his wife,
would not render her the le&s;s agreeable to
him; but that this unexpected meeting
might be a means of re-uniting them in their
former amity.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnold, &s;he &s;ays, in the pre&s;ence of
this gentleman, advanced with open arms
to embrace her, which &s;he not declining,
his friend having again felicitated them on
their reconciliation, took his leave, and Mr.
Arnold remained with his lady.</P>
<P>That at parting, which was not 'till late,
(as &s;he would not, on account of her repu|tation,
permit him to pa&s;s the night at her
lodgings) he promi&s;ed to bring her home
to his hou&s;e in a day or two; but unfortu|nately
for her he was taken ill in the interim,
which &s;he did not know of, 'till &s;he had an
account that Mr. Arnold had lo&s;t his &s;en&s;es.
The rea&s;on &s;he a&s;&s;igned for not enquiring af|ter
him &s;ooner was, that her pride would not
&s;uffer her to make any advances to a man,
who had been &s;o injurious as to part with
her; and &s;he thought it his duty to recall
her, without her taking any &s;tep towards
it.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="193">
This &s;tory &s;eems plau&s;ible; yet none of
our friends believe a word of it, and ima|gine
&s;omebody has contrived it for her.
The gentleman, who was the companion of
Mr. Arnold that night, &s;he &s;ays, can at a
proper time be produced as a witne&s;s, as al&s;o
her own maid, who can te&s;tify the truth of
this &s;tory. In the mean time this maid is
kept out of the way, and nobody can gue&s;s
at the gentleman, for his name is kept a pro|found
&s;ecret.</P>
<P>I am delighted at the &s;weetne&s;s of Mr.
Arnold's temper: vexatious as this affair
is likely to be, even at the be&s;t, he does
not &s;uffer it to interrupt our plea&s;ures or
his own good humour. On the contra|ry,
he is the more &s;tudious of promoting
every thing, which he thinks will entertain
me.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 28.&mdash;At length the poor Mi&s;s
Burchell is happily rid of her burthen; a
pretty little boy, my mother &s;ays it is: it
was, immediately after its birth, at which
my mother was pre&s;ent, privately baptized
by the name of Orlando, and &s;ent away
with its nur&s;e, a careful body, who had been
before provided for it. It pa&s;&s;es for the &s;on
of a captain Jefferis, abroad with the army.
Mi&s;s Burchell would never &s;uffer the nur&s;e
to &s;ee her; for as &s;he intends to rea&s;&s;ume
her own name, as &s;oon as &s;he &s;hall be in a
<PB N="192" REF="194">
condition to leave her pre&s;ent retirement,
&s;he would chu&s;e not to be known by the
woman, in ca&s;e of her going to &s;ee her
child. Every thing was managed with
&s;o much privacy, and Mi&s;s Burchell has
lived &s;o perfectly reclu&s;e, nobody ever vi|&s;iting
her but my mother, that in all proba|bility
this affair will always remain an entire
&s;ecret.</P>
<P>My mother &s;ays, that as &s;oon as Mi&s;s
Burchell (to whom &s;he con&s;iders her&s;elf as
a kind of patrone&s;s) is tolerably recovered,
&s;he will go down to Sidney-ca&s;tle; for &s;he
thinks her&s;elf in a &s;trange land any where
but there. And would you believe, it my
dear, &s;he has taken &s;uch a fancy to Mi&s;s
Burchell, that &s;he talks of inviting her down
with her, if &s;he can obtain her uncle's leave.
The girl mu&s;t certainly have &s;ome very ami|able
qualities, &s;o to captivate my mother, or
&s;he has an immen&s;ity of art. I dare &s;ay the
young lady will gladly accept of her invita|tion;
it will undoubtedly be a mo&s;t eligible
&s;ituation for her. I do not know what Sir
George may &s;ay to her carrying her humanity
&s;o far, as he hates the name of this poor
girl; but no matter, it may be a means of
pre&s;erving her character, which probably &s;he
might not long keep, if &s;he returned to live
with &s;o vile a woman as I conclude her aunt
to be; nor can &s;he have any colour for
<PB N="193" REF="195">
quitting her, whil&s;t her uncle lives; for I
find &s;he is an orphan, and has no relation
but him. She mu&s;t however go home for a
while, in order to get leave from him for this
vi&s;it to Sidney-ca&s;tle.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 26, 1704.&mdash;I am told the
widow Arnold computes the time of her ly|ing-in
about the latter end of the next
month; if it &s;hould &s;o happen, &s;he &s;aves
her di&s;tance, as her hu&s;band died in July,
a little before we went to Grim&s;ton-hall.
Mr. Arnold treats the affair very lightly, and
is only concerned at &s;eeing my mother &s;o
much affected by it. For my part, I form
my behaviour upon Mr. Arnold's conduct;
and as long as he appears ea&s;y, I &s;hall certain-be
&s;o too.</P>
<P>My brother throws out &s;ome unkind re|flections:
he &s;ays, he wonders the old Sybil
at Grim&s;ton-hall did not fore&s;ee this; and
congratulates me on my good fortune, in
having my jointure &s;ettled on that part of
the e&s;tate which is not di&s;puted. I really
think he &s;hews a &s;ort of ill-natured triumph
even in his condolements; for he generally
concludes them with thanking his &s;tars that <HI>he</HI>
had no hand in the match. I tru&s;t in God we
&s;hall none of us have any cau&s;e to repent it.
I am &s;ure I never &s;hall; for if Mr. Arnold
were reduced to the lowe&s;t ebb of fortune, I
<PB N="194" REF="196">
&s;hould find my con&s;olation in his kindne&s;s
and affection.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 27.&mdash;My mother is preparing
to leave town. Mi&s;s Burchell is quite reco|vered,
and propo&s;es going down to the
country to obtain her uncle's con&s;ent for the
intended vi&s;it. She &s;ays, &s;he can ea&s;ily tell
him &s;he made an acquaintance with lady Bi|dulph
in her late excur&s;ion to Bath, from
whom &s;he received an invitation, and &s;he is
&s;ure he will not refu&s;e to let her accept it.</P>
<P>Sir George laughs exceedingly at this plan.
He &s;ays his mother ought not to be &s;ur|prized
at Faulkland's falling into the girl's
&s;nares, &s;ince &s;he her&s;elf has done the &s;ame;
but he &s;uppo&s;es my mother thinks &s;he is
doing a very meritorious action, in affording
an a&s;ylum to this injured innocence. I give
you my brother's words, for I a&s;&s;ure you,
as to my&s;elf, I approve of my mother's
kindne&s;s to her, and think it may be a
means of pre&s;erving the girl from future
mi&s;chief.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 2.&mdash;Mi&s;s Burchell is gone into
the country, and this morning, for the fir&s;t
time, &s;evered me from the be&s;t of mother's.
I cannot recover my &s;pirits; I have wept all
day. Mr. Arnold, ever good and obliging,
would needs accompany her &s;ome miles on
her journey; you may be &s;ure I was not left
behind. Sir George was &s;o polite as to &s;ay,
<PB N="195" REF="197">
He would e&s;corte her down to Sidney-ca&s;tle.
I was &s;urprized at it; for he does not often
do obliging things. My mother gladly ac|cepted
of his company, and &s;aid, &s;he would
make him her pri&s;oner, when &s;he had him
there; for &s;he &s;hould be quite melancholy
without me for a time. Now though I
&s;hould be very unwilling not to allow the
merit of a good-natured action to Sir George,
yet do I attribute this in &s;ome mea&s;ure to its
an&s;wering a purpo&s;e of convenience to him|&s;elf.
You know, before his illne&s;s &s;ent him
to the Spa, he always &s;pent his &s;ummers
with us at the Ca&s;tle, though he has another
very convenient hou&s;e on his e&s;tate. When
he was in London, he never had any thing
but lodgings, for which I have often been
angry with him. My mother, &s;ince his re|turn,
made him a compliment of her hou&s;e;
but as the time &s;he took it for is now ex|pired,
and it is let to another family, he
could no longer continue in it. Mr. Arnold,
in the mo&s;t affectionate manner, pre&s;&s;ed him
to accept of an apartment with us, which
he declined. Now as he could not, without
&s;hewing us an apparent &s;light, continue in
town in other lodgings, I believe he, for th$s
rea&s;on, pre&s;erred going down with my mo|ther.
Be it as it may, I am very glad that &s;he
will have his company; for I make no doubt
<PB N="196" REF="198">
of his &s;taying with her &s;ome time, unle&s;s
mi&s;s Burchell &s;hould frighten him away.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 5.&mdash;I have been &s;o ca&s;t down
&s;ince my mother's departure, that Mr. Ar|nold's
obliging tender a&s;&s;iduity to plea&s;e and
entertain me &s;eems redoubled; but indeed I
am wearied with a continual round of noi&s;y
plea&s;ures, and long to get back to Arnold-abbey.
I hope to be there in about three
weeks, or a month at farthe&s;t. My mother
has di&s;pen&s;ed with our going down to her
this &s;ummer. She thinks it might be attend|ed
with inconveniencies to me, and talks of
coming to town again in a few months; but
I &s;hall in&s;i&s;t on her not giving her&s;elf the fa|tigue
of &s;o long a journey, unle&s;s &s;he comes to
&s;tay all the next winter with us.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 20.&mdash;My mother writes me
word that Mi&s;s Burchell has obtained leave
of her uncle, and is come to Sidney-ca&s;tle:
&s;he &s;ays, &s;he never &s;aw a better behaved
young creature. Sir George has taken &s;o
much offence at her coming, that he talks of
going to his own hou&s;e. My mother adds,
&startq;He behaves, however, with manners, but I
&s;hall not pre&s;s him to &s;tay.&endq;</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 6.&mdash;An important birth, my
Cecilia! the widow Arnold has produced a
young mi&s;s. I a&s;&s;ure you the little dam&s;el
has been u&s;hered into life with all the cere|mony
due to a young heire&s;s; and her mother
<PB N="197" REF="199">
introduces her as one, whom an unju&s;t
uncle debars of her right. Now you mu&s;t
know, that upon an exact calculation, this
little girl has made her appearance ju&s;t twelve
days later than &s;he ought to have done, to
prove her legitimacy, dating the po&s;&s;ibility
of her being Mr. Arnold's, from the very
day whereon he took that illne&s;s of which he
died, and which confined him for five days
to his bed. In all that time his &s;ervants ne|ver
le&s;t him for a minute; this has occa&s;ion|ed
various &s;peculations; our lawyers &s;ay,
that it is enough to de&s;troy her preten&s;ions;
but &s;ome phy&s;icians, who have been con&s;ult|ed
on the occa&s;ion, are of a contrary opini|on;
and declare they have known in&s;tances
of children being born, even &s;o long after
the &s;tated time allotted by nature for their
coming into life.</P>
<P>It is a very unlucky affair, and has in|volved
us in a law-&s;uit. Who the per&s;on is,
that &s;ecretly abets the widow, we cannot
find out; but it is certain &s;he has &s;omebody;
every one believes this is an infamous and
unju&s;t claim; and the woman's folly almo&s;t
frees her from the &s;u&s;picion of its being of
her own cont$iving.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 10.&mdash;You cannot imagine my Ceci|lia,
how happy I think my&s;elf, after &s;uch a
hurrying winter as I have had, to find my|&s;elf
once more re&s;tored to my favourite plea|&s;ures,
<PB N="198" REF="200">
the calm delights of &s;olitude. Ar|nold-abbey
&s;eems a paradi&s;e to me now.</P>
<P>Lady Grim&s;ton &s;hewed me a &s;pecimen of
her humour this morning, in talking of the
widow Arnold. She &s;aid &s;he was an <HI>harlot,</HI>
that having already di&s;graced the family,
now wanted to beggar them; but that if
Mr. Arnold did not make an example of
her, &s;he would never own him for a kin&s;|man.</P>
<P>My chearful old Dean &s;ays, he is now
completely happy, having lived to &s;ee his
daughter married (while we were in town)
very much to his and her &s;atisfaction. I
am heartily glad of it, neither am I &s;orry
(for her &s;ake) that &s;he has left the country.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 11.&mdash;Mrs. Vere is come to &s;pend
a few weeks with me according to her pro|mi&s;e.
She is a truly amiable creature; her
di&s;po&s;ition is &s;o gentle, her temper &s;o mild,
&s;uch a &s;weet humility in her whole deport|ment,
that it a&s;toni&s;hes me her mother can
&s;till per&s;i&s;t in her unkindne&s;s to her. But
the elde&s;t daughter was always her darling,
who, I under&s;tand, is pretty much of her
mother's own ca&s;t; and makes a very ter|magant
wife to a very turbulent hu&s;band.
So that notwith&s;tanding their title (for he is
a baronet) and immen&s;e riches, they are a
very mi&s;erable pair.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="201">
They were lately to pay lady Grim&s;ton a
vi&s;it; but there happened &s;uch a frecas, that
probably it may be the la&s;t &s;he will ever re|ceive
from them. The hu&s;band it &s;eems, tho'
very rough and &s;urly in his nature, is, not|with&s;tanding,
a well-meaning man, and not
void of humanity; which had induced him
to give a &s;mall portion to a young girl, a
di&s;tant relation of his own, who had been
left an orphan. She was beloved by the &s;on
of a &s;ub&s;tantial farmer, a tenant of the ba|ronet's,
and had an equal affection for him;
but the young man depending entirely on
his father for his future pro&s;pects, dur&s;t not
take a wife without &s;omething to begin the
world with; for his father had ju&s;t put him
into the management of one of his farms.
The young lady and her mother (who was a
widow, and is but lately dead) had boarded
for &s;ome years at this hone&s;t farmer's hou&s;e,
and in that time a mutual love had been con|tracted
between the young people. The old
man him&s;elf liked the girl &s;o well for a
daughter-in-law, that his only objection was
her want of fortune; but this was &s;uch an
ob&s;tacle as was not to be &s;urmounted by a
man, who, being accu&s;tomed to earn mo|ney
by indefatigable indu&s;try, put the utmo&s;t
value upon it. His regard to his &s;on's hap|pine&s;s,
however, made him re&s;olve to try
an experiment in his favour, and accordingly
<PB N="200" REF="202">
he plucked up courage, and went to his land|lord.
He told him, in his own blunt way,
that he came to &s;peak to him in behalf of
a poor young gentlewoman that was his (Sir
William's) relation. I have a &s;on that loves
her, &s;aid he, and &s;he loves him, but I
cannot afford to let the boy marry a wife that
has nothing; and you know &s;he has no por|tion.
I would not de&s;ire much with her,
for &s;he is a good girl, and very hou&s;ewifely;
but if you will be &s;o kind to give her &s;ome|thing
to &s;et them a going a little, I &s;hall be
content; if not you will be the cau&s;e of my
&s;on's lo&s;ing a wife, for he &s;wears he will ne|ver
marry any other woman, and &s;he, poor
thing, may pine away for love. I do not
de&s;ire this match out of the ambition of
having my boy related to you, but becau&s;e I
think the girl is an hone&s;t girl, and may make
him happy.</P>
<P>The rough hone&s;ty of the farmer plea&s;ed
his landlord &s;o well, that he gave the young
woman five hundred pounds to &s;et them a
going, as the old yeoman termed it. Tho'
this &s;um was but a trifle to a man of his for|tune,
and the giving it was a prai&s;e-worthy
action, yet did it exceedingly di&s;plea&s;e his lady,
e&s;pecially as he had not thought proper to con|&s;ult
her on the occa&s;ion. She was not contented
with venting her indignation on her hu&s;band
at home, but &s;he renewed the quarrel, by
<PB N="201" REF="203">
complaining to lady Grim&s;ton, that her
opinion and advice were not only de&s;pi&s;ed,
but that Sir William was lavi&s;hing away the
fortune <HI>&s;he</HI> had brought him, upon a <HI>tribe</HI> of
poor relations of his own. Lady Grim&s;ton
immediately took fire; &s;he could not bear
the thoughts of having her daughter's au|thority
of le&s;s weight in his family, than her
own had been, and &s;he attacked her &s;on-in-law
with acrimony on the &s;ubject. His an|&s;wer
to her was &s;hort. Look ye, lady
Grim&s;ton, you made a very ob&s;treperous
wife to a very peaceable hu&s;band; your
daughter, I find, is mightily di&s;po&s;ed to
follow your example; but as I am not quite
&s;o tame as my father-in-law was, I will &s;uffer
her to &s;ee as little of it as may be. With this
he turned from her, and ordering his coach
and &s;ix to be got ready immediately, with
very little ceremony he forced his wife into it,
and carried her home directly, leaving lady
Grim&s;ton foaming with rage. The alterca|tion
had been carried on with &s;o little cauti|on,
that the &s;ervants heard it, and the &s;tory
is the je&s;t of the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I am not &s;orry for this breach; it
may be the better for poor Mrs. Vere; for
tho' her mother's jointure reverts to a male
relation, on whom the e&s;tate was &s;ettled, yet
as lady Grim&s;ton has a large per&s;onal fortune,
<PB N="202" REF="204">
it is in her power to make her daughter full
amends for the injury &s;he did her.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 20&mdash;Mr. Arnold is improving
his gardens, and taking in a great deal more
ground to enlarge them. I do not expre&s;s
the lea&s;t di&s;&s;atisfaction at this, though I own
I could wi&s;h he would not engage in new ex|pences
on an e&s;tate which is now in litigation;
but our lawyers are &s;o &s;anguine, that they en|courage
him to proceed.</P>
<P><HI>[The following is writ in the hand of the

<P><HI>September</HI> 25.&mdash;How delightful are the
&s;en&s;ations, my dear Cecilia, that I feel hour|ly
&s;pringing in my heart! Surely the tender|ne&s;s
of a mother can never be &s;ufficiently
repaid; and I now more than ever rejoice in
having, by an obedience, which perhaps I
once thought had &s;ome little merit in it, con|tributed
&s;o much to the repo&s;e of a parent,
to whom I have &s;uch numberle&s;s obligations.
I never &s;ee my dear little girl, but I think
&s;uch were the tender &s;entiments, the &s;weet
anxieties, that my honoured and beloved
mother felt when her Sidney was &s;uch a brat
as this. Then I &s;ay, &s;urely I have a right to
all the duty, all the filial love that this crea|ture
<PB N="203" REF="205">
can &s;hew me, in return for my fond|ne&s;s.
As for Mr. Arnold, he idolizes it;
you never &s;aw &s;o good a nur&s;e as he makes.
Lady Grim&s;ton declares, we are both in a
fair way of ruining the child, and advi&s;es
us to &s;end it out of the hou&s;e, that we may
not grow too fond of it: but we &s;hall hard|ly
take her coun&s;el.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 28.&mdash;I informed you be|fore
that Mi&s;s Burchell had been &s;ummoned
home by her uncle, who was then very ill.
She has lately written an account to my mo|ther
of his death; and that as &s;he has now her
fortune in her own hands, &s;he intends im|mediately
to quit her aunt, and look out for
&s;ome genteel and reputable family in Lon|don
(where it &s;eems &s;he chu&s;es to re&s;ide) to
lodge with.</P>
<P>My mother, in her letter to me, expre&s;&s;es
great &s;atisfaction at her re&s;olution to leave
her aunt, but is not without her fears, that
&s;o pretty a young woman, left to her own
guidance, may be liable to danger; though
&s;he thinks both her natural di&s;po&s;ition, and
her good &s;en&s;e, &s;ufficient to guard her again&s;t
actual evil.</P>
<P>Our lawyer writes us word, that he has
had an offer of a compo&s;ition, propo&s;ed by
the widow Arnold's people: he &s;ays, though
the &s;um they mention is a very round one,
yet it plainly indicates the weakne&s;s of their
hopes; and concludes with telling Mr. Ar|nold,
<PB N="204" REF="206">
that if &s;ix-pence would buy them off,
he &s;hould not, with his con&s;ent, give it to
them; as it would tacitly admit the legality
of their claim, and might be productive of
trouble&s;ome con&s;equences hereafter; and
therefore he would by all means have the
i&s;&s;ue fairly tried. Mr. Arnold laughs hear|tily
at the propo&s;al, but &s;ays he is very much
obliged to the lady for conde&s;cending to
give up more than half, when her daughter
has a right to the whole; without who&s;e
con&s;ent he &s;uppo&s;es it is not in the mother's
power to make terms.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h we were rid of this trouble&s;ome
affair, as it mu&s;t hurry us to town &s;ooner
than we intended, and the country is &s;till
delightful.</P>
<P><HI>London, October</HI> 1.&mdash;Again we have
quitted our &s;weet retirement for the noi&s;e
and bu&s;tle of London; but this law bu&s;ine&s;s,
it &s;eems, mu&s;t be clo&s;ely pur&s;ued, though
our antagoni&s;t's motions &s;eem a little dilato|ry.
We cannot find out the &s;ecret &s;pring
that &s;ets the machine a going; the wheels
however do not &s;eem to move with &s;uch
alacrity as they did; though the widow
&s;till talks big, and &s;ays, we &s;hall repent of
having rejected her offer.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 3.&mdash;My brother is arrived in
town, but took care to &s;ettle him&s;elf in
hand&s;ome commodious lodgings before he
paid us a vi&s;it, for fear, I &s;uppo&s;e, that we
<PB N="205" REF="207">
&s;hould again pre&s;s him to accept of apart|ments
in our hou&s;e. I &s;ee he is determined
to keep up nothing more than an intercour&s;e
barely civil. Mr. Arnold cannot but be
di&s;gu&s;ted with his behaviour, but he is too
delicate to take notice of it to me.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 7.&mdash;I am di&s;appointed in my
hopes of &s;eeing my dear mother in town
this winter. Her apartment was ready for
her, and I delighted my&s;elf with the thoughts
of &s;eeing her in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, at lea&s;t for
a few months; but &s;he writes me word that
her old rheumatick complaint is returned
on her with &s;uch violence, that &s;he cannot
think of undertaking the journey. Sadly
am I grieved at this news, and &s;hall long
to have the winter over, that Mr. Arnold
and I may fly to Sidney-ca&s;tle; he has pro|mi&s;ed
me this &s;atisfaction early in the &s;um|mer.</P>
<P>My mother informs me that Mi&s;s Bur|chell
con&s;tantly corre&s;ponds with her: &s;he
tells her that her aunt is come to town to
&s;ollicit for her pen&s;ion, but that &s;he never
&s;ees her; and as &s;he means to drop all cor|re&s;pondence
with her, &s;he does not intend
even to let her know where &s;he lodges.
I commend Mi&s;s Burchell highly for this,
as the acquaintance of &s;uch a woman may
be hurtful to her reputation.</P>
<P><HI>[Here en&s;ues another interval of nine
months, in which nothing particular is re|lated,
<PB N="206" REF="208">
but that Mrs. Arnold became mother
to a &s;econd child. This la&s;t circum&s;tance,
with a few others preceding and &s;ucceeding
that event, are related in the Journal by
her maid Patty; after which Mrs. Ar|nold
her&s;elf proceeds.]</HI></P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 1, 1705.&mdash;Again, my dear Ce|cilia,
I am able to rea&s;&s;ume my pen. I
have read what Patty has writ, and find
&s;he is admirable at the anecdotes of a nur|&s;ery.
Am I not rich, think you? Two
daughters, and both perfect beauties, and
great wits you may be &s;ure!</P>
<P>The new-born dam&s;el was baptized this
day by the dear-loved name of Cecilia. I
am angry with Mr. Arnold, he takes &s;o
little notice of this young &s;tranger; his af|fections
are all engaged by Dolly: indeed,
I am almo&s;t jealous of her; for he &s;pends
mo&s;t of the time he is at home in the
nur&s;ery.</P>
<P>Our antagoni&s;t is grown alert again, and
has renewed her efforts, which we thought
began to flag a little, with fre&s;h vigour.
Whence &s;he derives tho&s;e revived hopes
is &s;till a my&s;tery; but &s;he now &s;ays, &s;he
would not accept of a compo&s;ition if it
were offered. My poor Mr. Arnold be|gins
to fret a little, it now and then makes
him thoughtful; not that he &s;ays he has the
lea&s;t doubt about his &s;ucce&s;s, but he has
been much harra&s;&s;ed with the nece&s;&s;ary at|tendance
<PB N="207" REF="209">
that the cau&s;e requires, and down|right
tired with dangling after lawyers; be|&s;ides,
they &s;ay the cau&s;e cannot come to an
hearing in the en&s;uing term, though they
before made us hope, that it would be at
an end long before this time.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 3.&mdash;I am mortified exceedingly,
my dear Cecilia: I find I am not likely to
&s;ee my mother this &s;ummer. I thought I
could not have lived &s;o long from her
&s;ight. Indeed it was purely in the hope of
making her this vi&s;it, that I prevented her
coming to town in the &s;pring, which &s;he
purpo&s;ed doing, though far from being well
enough to undertake the journey. I own I
have been impatient under my confinement,
as that, and my previous circum&s;tances, de|tained
us &s;o long in town, and I this day
a&s;ked Mr. Arnold when we &s;hould &s;et out
for Sidney-ca&s;tle. He an&s;wered me, that
he feared it would not be in his power this
&s;ea&s;on to pay the intended vi&s;it to my mo|ther:
he &s;ays, he has not been near his
e&s;tate in Kent the&s;e five years, except for a
day or two at a time, and that he thinks it
nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ee what condition it is in. I
believe I have told you that there is a pretty
hou&s;e on it. The place is called South-park,
and is that which my mother cho&s;e for my
&s;ettlement. Mr. Arnold, who always pre|ferred
Arnold-abbey to it, hardly ever vi|&s;ited
this place; and as he never re&s;ided
<PB N="208" REF="210">
there, and only lay at an inn when he went
down, the hou&s;e is unfurni&s;hed, excepting
a room or two, which a man who receives
his rent has ju&s;t made habitable for his own
convenience.</P>
<P>But that I have laid it down as a rule
never to oppo&s;e &s;o good, &s;o indulgent a
hu&s;band as Mr. Arnold is, in any in&s;tance,
wherein I do not think a &s;uperior duty re|quires
me to do &s;o, I &s;hould certainly
&s;hew &s;ome di&s;approbation of what he now
purpo&s;es doing. It will be attended with
&s;o much trouble, &s;o much expence too: he
has ordered the hou&s;e at South-park to be
completely furni&s;hed, and &s;ays, he hopes I
&s;hall like it &s;o well as to be induced to pa&s;s
the remainder of the &s;ummer there. Mo&s;t
&s;ure it is, every place will be delightful to
me where I can enjoy his company, and
have my dear little babes with me; but me|thinks
two country hou&s;es are an unnece&s;&s;ary
charge, and more than &s;uits our fortune. I
pray God this tender hu&s;band may not have
a &s;trong and prudent rea&s;on for this conduct,
which out of kindne&s;s he conceals; perhaps
he thinks this little &s;pot at South-park may
&s;ome time hence be the whole of our de|pendence,
and he has a mind to be before|hand
with ill fortune, in rendering that re|treat
agreeable to me, and rather an object
of choice than of nece&s;&s;ity. If this be his
motive, How much am I obliged to him?
<PB N="209" REF="211">
He has not hinted any thing like it; nor
would I da&s;h the plea&s;ure he &s;eems to pro|mi&s;e
him&s;elf there, by in&s;inuating the lea&s;t
&s;u&s;picion of what his rea&s;ons are for going to
it. If we lo&s;e Arnold-abbey, and the whole
e&s;tate belonging to it, I &s;hall only regret it
for his &s;ake.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 8.&mdash;We are to &s;et out to-mor|row,
my Cecilia, for our place in Kent. I
have made the be&s;t apology that I could to
my mother, and Mr. Arnold too has writ to
her; but I know &s;he will be extremely di&s;|appointed
at not &s;eeing us.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 12.&mdash;We are &s;afely arrived at
South-park, Mr. Arnold in high &s;pirits,
and my two young travellers bore the fa|tigue
extremely well.</P>
<P>I am not &s;urprized that Mr. Arnold liked
the old family &s;eat better than this. I
cannot &s;ay I am much charmed with it,
but I will not let him &s;ee that. I affect to
admire, and &s;eem plea&s;ed with every thing
that affords me the lea&s;t opportunity of
commendation. The hou&s;e is a very neat
one; it has not been many years built, and is
in perfectly good repair. It is genteelly,
though plainly furni&s;hed, and we have a
tolerable garden; but as the whole domain
is let, we are obliged to take a few fields
from one of our tenants, to &s;upply our im|mediate
want. We are in a very genteel
<PB N="210" REF="212">
and populous neighbourhood, and within
a mile of a good market town.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 20.&mdash;I have regretted nothing
&s;o much in my ab&s;ence from Arnold-abbey,
as the being cut off from the hope of &s;eeing
my amiable Mrs. Vere. We can have
but <HI>one friend</HI> to &s;hare our heart, to whom
we have no re&s;erve, and who&s;e lo&s;s is irre|parable;
but I perceive the ab&s;ence of a plea|&s;ing
acquaintance, who&s;e &s;ociety is no farther
nece&s;&s;ary to us, than as it contributes to enliv|en
&s;olitude, and gets a preference to others
merely by compari&s;on, is a lo&s;s ea&s;ily &s;up|plied;
this I find by experience. There
are Mrs. Veres every where; but, alas!
there is but <HI>one</HI> Cecilia!</P>
<P>I was vi&s;ited to-day by two ladies that I
am charmed with, though it is the fir&s;t
time I have &s;een either of them. The one
is lady V. of whom you have formerly
heard. Her Lord and &s;he came together;
their &s;eat is within a mile of us, and Mr.
Arnold had a &s;light acquaintance with lord
V. before. My lady is about forty, and has
that kind of countenance that at once invites
your confidence; I never &s;aw integrity, be|nevolence,
and good &s;en&s;e, more &s;trongly
pictured in a face; her addre&s;s is &s;o plain,
&s;o perfectly free from affectation, or any of
the little &s;upercilious forms of ceremony,
that a per&s;on ignorant of what politene&s;s
con&s;i&s;ts in, would imagine &s;he wanted breed|ing;
<PB N="211" REF="213">
yet &s;he received her education in a
court; but &s;he &s;eems to let good &s;en&s;e and
good nature pre&s;ide over all her words and
actions rather than form. She told me &s;he
had de&s;erred her vi&s;it to me, longer perhaps
than the laws of decorum would admit of,
as we were &s;uch near neighbours; but,
&s;aid &s;he, I was determined not to be over|looked
in the crowd of vi&s;itors that have
been thronging to you every day, &s;ince you
came down. The character I have heard
of you, makes me wi&s;h for an intimacy
with you, and you are not to look upon
this as a vi&s;it of ceremony, but as an ad|vance
towards that friend&s;hip I wi&s;h to
cultivate.</P>
<P>She &s;poke this with &s;o frank an air, that
flattering as the compliment appeared, I
could not help believing her &s;incere; and
thought my&s;elf, that my appearance did
not dimini&s;h that good opinion which &s;he
&s;aid &s;he had conceived of me from report.</P>
<P>Lord V&mdash;is many years older than his
lady; a robu&s;t man, as plain in his way as
my lady is in her's; though <HI>his</HI> way and
<HI>her's</HI> are very different; for he is frank
even to bluntne&s;s, but the be&s;t humoured
man living.</P>
<P>The other lady whom I mentioned is a
widow; her name is Gerrarde, and &s;he
lives upon a little e&s;tate &s;he has in this neigh|bourhood.
I think I never beheld &s;o fine a
<PB N="212" REF="214">
creature; &s;he is about &s;ix and twenty; her
&s;tature, which is much above the common
&s;ize, is rendered perfectly graceful and ma|je&s;tic
by one of the fine&s;t &s;hapes in the
world; if her grace is not altogether &s;o re|gularly
beautiful as her per&s;on, it is, how|ever,
hand&s;ome enough to render any wo|man
charming who had nothing el&s;e to boa&s;t
of. Whether her under&s;tanding be of a
piece with the re&s;t, I have not yet been able
to di&s;cover. Her vi&s;it to me was but &s;hort,
for &s;he had not &s;at with me an hour when
lady V&mdash;came in, and &s;he then took her
leave; but by what I could ob&s;erve in that
little time, &s;he &s;eems to have as much viva|city
and agreeable humour, as I ever met
with in any one. She pre&s;&s;ed me to dine
with her at her cottage, as &s;he calls it, to|morrow,
and I like her too well to refu&s;e
the invitation.</P>
<P>The&s;e two charming women, I think, I
&s;hall &s;ingle out for my chief intimates, from
the crowd which have been to compliment
me, on my coming into this country.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnold is mightily plea&s;ed with them
both; but he gives the preference to lady
V&mdash;, whom, tho' he had a &s;light acquaint|ance
with her lord, he never &s;aw before.
But he is almo&s;t as great a &s;tranger in this
place as I am: he is highly delighted at my
having met with people who are likely to
render it agreeable to me.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="215">
<HI>July</HI> 21.&mdash;We dined to day accord|ing
to appointment with Mrs. Gerrarde. A
cottage &s;he called her hou&s;e, nor does it
appear much better at the out&s;ide, but
within it is a fairy palace. Never was any
thing &s;o neat, &s;o elegant, &s;o perfectly well
fan&s;ied, as the fitting up of all her rooms.
Her bedchambers are furni&s;hed with fine
chintzs, and her drawing-room with the
prettie&s;t Indian &s;attin I ever &s;aw. Her lit|tle
villa is called A&s;hby, and her hu&s;band,
&s;he told me, purcha&s;ed it for her &s;ome time
before his death, and left it to her; but
&s;he has &s;ince had a con&s;iderable addition to
her fortune, by the death of a relation.</P>
<P>Our entertainment was &s;plendid almo&s;t to
profu&s;ion, though there was no company
but Mr. Arnold and I. I told her, if &s;he
always gave &s;uch dinners, it would frighten
me away from her: indeed it was the only
circum&s;tance in her whole conduct that
did not plea&s;e me, for I was charmed
with the re&s;t of her behaviour. They mu&s;t
&s;urely be of a very churli&s;h di&s;po&s;ition, who
are not plea&s;ed, where a manife&s;t de&s;ire to
oblige is con&s;picuous in every word and ac|tion.
If Mrs. Gerrarde is not as highly
poli&s;hed as &s;ome women are, who, perhaps,
have had a more enlarged education, &s;he
makes full amends for it by a perfect good
humour, a &s;prightline&s;s always entertaining,
and a quickne&s;s of thought, that gives her
conver&s;ation an air of &s;omething very <HI>like</HI>
<PB N="214" REF="216">
wit, and which I dare &s;ay pa&s;&s;es for the
thing it&s;elf with mo&s;t people.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 24.&mdash;I have returned lady
V&mdash;'s vi&s;it, and am more delighted with
her than before. Mr. Arnold went with
me; but my lord not being at home, he
went to ramble about the grounds, &s;o that
I had a long <HI>tete a tete</HI> with lady V&mdash;. She
is an admirable woman, &s;o fine an under|&s;tanding,
&s;uch delicacy of &s;entiment, and
&s;uch an unaffected complai&s;ance in her man|ner,
that I do not wonder my lord perfectly
adores her. There is a tenderne&s;s, a ma|ternal
kindne&s;s in her behaviour towards
me, that fills me at once with love and re|verence
for her; and next to my Cecilia, I
think I never met with any woman whom I
could &s;o highly e&s;teem as lady V&mdash;. She
is an admirable mi&s;tre&s;s of her needle, and
every room in her hou&s;e exhibits &s;ome pro|duction
of a very fine genius, united with
very great indu&s;try: for there are beds,
chairs, and carpets, be&s;ides &s;ome very pretty
rural pro&s;pects in pannels, executed with
inimitable &s;kill, and very excellent ta&s;te.
She tells me, if I will give her leave to
bring her work with her, &s;he will live whole
days with me.</P>
<P>I am rejoiced now that Mr. Arnold
thought of coming to South-Park. How
valuable is the acquaintance of &s;uch a wo|man
as lady V&mdash;! and I might never have
<PB N="215" REF="217">
known her, but for a circum&s;tance to which
I was at fir&s;t &s;o aver&s;e. And then my a|greeable
lively Mrs. Gerrarde! My acquaint|ance
at Arnold-abbey begin to fade upon
my memory: to &s;ay the truth, I think of
none of them with plea&s;ure, but Mrs. Vere,
and my good humoured old Dean.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 4.&mdash;Mrs. Gerrarde is a little
fancy monopoli&s;t; &s;he grumbles if I do not
&s;ee her every day, and is downright jealous
of my intimacy with lady V&mdash;. They are
acquainted, but I don't find there is a very
clo&s;e intercour&s;e between them: Mrs. Ger|rarde
&s;ays, her lady&s;hip is too good a hou&s;e|wife
for her; and as &s;he is not very fond of
needle-work her&s;elf, &s;he cannot endure peo|ple
that are always poring over a frame. I
find indeed, that this &s;prightly rogue is fond|er
of cards than of work: &s;he draws Mr.
Arnold and me in very often for a pool at
picquet: at her hou&s;e I am obliged to &s;ub|mit;
but at my own, I often take up a
book, when &s;he and Mr. Arnold are engaged
at their game, and make them decide the
conte&s;t between them. Nay, I threaten
that I will, &s;ome night or other, &s;teal to bed
and leave them; for &s;he is uncon&s;cionable at
late hours; and as &s;he lives very near us,
and keeps a chariot, &s;he does not &s;cruple to
go home at any hour of the night. What
a pity it is &s;o amiable a woman &s;hould be
thus fondly attached to &s;o unprofitable an
<PB N="216" REF="218">
amu&s;ement! for I begin to &s;ee play is her
foible; though, to do her ju&s;tice, &s;he ne|ver
engages but for very trifling &s;ums, and
that only in our own little dome&s;tic way.
But this pa&s;&s;ion may grow upon her, and
&s;he may be led unawares into the lo&s;ing
more than her fortune can bear.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 12.&mdash;I was never &s;o di&s;con|certed
as I have been this day: you will be
&s;urprized when I tell you, it was by my
good lady V&mdash;. She came to pa&s;s the day
with me, Mr. Arnold being engaged abroad.</P>
<P>We were both &s;itting at work in the par|lour:
lady V&mdash;had contiuned &s;ilent for a
good while; at la&s;t la&s;t looking at me with
a mo&s;t benign &s;mile, for I had at the &s;ame
in&s;tant ca&s;t my eyes at her; I was ju&s;t then
thinking, my dear Mrs. Arnold, &s;aid &s;he,
that I once (though perhaps you did not know
it) flattered my&s;elf with the hopes of being
related to you. Her words threw me into
confu&s;ion, though I did not know their mean|ing.
It would have been both an honour
and a happine&s;s to me, madam, I replied,
though I don't know by what means I was
ever likely to po&s;&s;e&s;s it. She continued
&s;miling, but &s;eemed in &s;u&s;pence whether &s;he
&s;hould proceed. You will pardon my curi|o&s;ity,
my dear, &s;aid &s;he, but give me leave
to a&s;k, whether Mr. Arnold was not once
near lo&s;ing the happine&s;s he now enjoys? I
felt my face glow as &s;he &s;poke. There was
<PB N="217" REF="219">
once a treaty of marriage on foot, madam, be|tween
me and another gentleman. I am &s;orry
I mentioned it, &s;aid my lady, ob&s;erving my
confu&s;ion; but as I was no &s;tranger to the
affair while it was tran&s;acting, and Mr.
Faulkland is a kin&s;man of mine, I hope you
will forgive my inqui&s;itivene&s;s; for I own I
have a curio&s;ity, which I believe no body
but your&s;elf can gratify; and if I did not
think you the mo&s;t candid, as well as the
be&s;t tempered creature living, I dur&s;t not
pu&s;h my enquiry. My lord, you are to
know, was in London, at the time Mr.
Faulkland was fir&s;t introduced to you; and
as they are extremely fond of each other,
Mr. Faulkland did not &s;cruple to di&s;clo&s;e his
pa&s;&s;ion to him, nor the &s;ucce&s;s it then ap|peared
likely to be crowned with, giving
him at the &s;ame time &s;uch a character of you,
as I have &s;ince found you de&s;erve.</P>
<P>When my lord returned to V&mdash;hall,
which he was obliged to do very &s;oon after
Mr. Faulkland had made this di&s;covery to
him, he informed me of the alliance my
cou&s;in Faulkland was going to make; and
we were plea&s;ing our&s;elves with the thoughts
of congratulating him on his happine&s;s,
when we received a letter from him that put
an end to all our expectations; this letter
contained but four di&s;tracted lines: he told
my lord, in broken &s;entences, that he had
lo&s;t all hopes of Mi&s;s Bidulph; that an act
<PB N="218" REF="220">
of indi&s;cretion had been con&s;trued into a
capital crime; and that being bani&s;hed from
the pre&s;ence of the woman he adored, he was
immediately about to bid adieu to England,
perhaps for ever.</P>
<P>This was the &s;ub&s;tance of what he wrote
to us: we have heard from him &s;ince a few
times, but he never cleared up the matter to
us, nor even &s;o much as mentioned it. I
have not been in London &s;ince; my lord
has; but he never could get any light into
the my&s;tery; he heard from &s;ome of our
friends, who knew of the intended match,
that it was broke off, no body knew why.
There were, however, &s;everal idle &s;urmi&s;es
thrown out; &s;ome laid the blame on Mr.
Faulkland, and &s;ome on you; but the truth
I believe remains &s;till a &s;ecret. Now, my
dear, if my curio&s;ity is improper, or if there
was any particular motive to this di&s;appoint|ment
of my kin&s;man's hopes, which you
don't chu&s;e to reveal, forgive my enquiry,
and think no more of it; but take up that
book, and read to me while I work.</P>
<P>Though my lady gave me this kind oppor|tunity
of evading her que&s;tion, I did not lay
hold of it: I did not indeed chu&s;e to reveal
the whole of this affair, becau&s;e I did not
think my&s;elf at liberty to divulge Mi&s;s
Burchell's &s;ecret, however I might di&s;cover
my own. I told my lady in general terms,
that though Mr. Faulkland might pretend
<PB N="219" REF="221">
to a lady every way my &s;uperior, yet there
was an objection to him of no &s;mall weight
with us; that my mother had been informed
of a very recent piece of gallantry he had
had with a per&s;on of &s;ome condition, and
that it had di&s;gu&s;ted her &s;o much, &s;he could
not think of uniting me with a man who&s;e
pa&s;&s;ions were not a little more &s;taid; and
that this was the &s;ole rea&s;on of her di&s;like to
a gentleman, who was in every other re&s;pect
unexceptionable. I am glad it was no wor&s;e,
&s;aid lady V&mdash;, &s;miling, I am &s;ure Mr. Faulk|land
is not capable of a <HI>ba&s;e</HI> action; youth|ful
follies he may have had, though I believe
as few even of tho&s;e to an&s;wer for as mo&s;t
men of his yea. I make not the lea&s;t doubt,
however, that lady Bidulph was guided by
prudence in what &s;he did. She certainly
could not be too cautious in the di&s;po&s;al of
<HI>&s;uch</HI> a child as you; and whatever Mr.
Faulkland's di&s;appointment may be, <HI>you</HI> I
hope are happy. Lady V&mdash;looked at me
as &s;he pronounced the&s;e words, with an in|qui&s;itive,
though tender regard. I was glad
of an opportunity of enlarging on the merits
of Mr. Arnold, and told her, I was as hap|py
as my heart could wi&s;h, or the worthie&s;t
of men could make me. I am glad of it,
&s;aid &s;he, with a quickne&s;s in her voice; but
don't imagine, my dear Mrs. Arnold, (and
&s;he took me by the hand) that I introduced
this conver&s;ation merely to gratify a curi|o&s;ity,
<PB N="220" REF="222">
which I fear you mu&s;t condemn in
your private thoughts, though you have
been &s;o good as to &s;atisfy it: I had another
rea&s;on, a much &s;tronger one. What is it,
dear madam? almo&s;t &s;tarting with apprehen|&s;ions
of I did not know what. Don't be
alarmed, &s;aid &s;he, &s;miling, it is only this;
a great aunt of Mr. Faulkland's is lately dead,
who has left him a con&s;iderable per&s;onal
e&s;tate, and he is coming over to take po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of it; otherwi&s;e I don't know when we
&s;hould have &s;een him in England. My lord
had a letter very lately from him; he was
then at Turin, where he had met with our
elde&s;t &s;on, who is now on his travels: he
told us he had letters and &s;ome tokens of
love to deliver to us from him; and that he
&s;hould immediately on his arrival in England
come to V&mdash;hall, where he would pa&s;s a
month with us. Now as we expect him
daily, I had a mind to apprize you of his in|tended
vi&s;it, that you might not be &s;ur|prized,
by perhaps unexpectedly meeting
him at my hou&s;e. I thanked her lady|&s;hip
for her obliging caution, tho' I thought
it had &s;omething in it that mortified me. I
told her, that though I &s;hould not &s;eek to
renew my acquaintance with Mr. Faulkland,
yet had I no rea&s;on to avoid him. Lady V&mdash;,
who is extremely quick of apprehen&s;ion, re|plied,
without doubt, madam, you have
<PB N="221" REF="223">
not; but you might be &s;urprized at &s;eeing
him notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P>She pre&s;ently turned the di&s;cour&s;e; but
made me happy the whole day, by that in|exhau&s;tible
fund of good &s;en&s;e and improving
knowledge, of which &s;he is mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnold came not home 'till very late;
he complains that he is got into a knot of
acquaintance that like the bottle too well;
but I am &s;ure his natural &s;obriety is &s;uch, that
it will not be in the power of example to
lead him into intemperance; though I am
vexed he has fallen into &s;uch acquaintance,
becau&s;e I know drinking is di&s;agreeable to
him: yet a country gentleman mu&s;t &s;ome|times
give a little into it, to avoid the cha|racter
of being &s;ingular.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 22.&mdash;Surprized I was not, be|cau&s;e
I came prepared; but I own I was
aba&s;hed, at &s;eeing Mr. Faulkland to-day.
Mr. Arnold and I were invited to dine at
lord V&mdash;'s, and his lord&s;hip, and his
gue&s;t, came in from the fields where they
had been walking, ju&s;t as we were ready to
&s;it down to table.</P>
<P>There happened to be a good deal more
company; Mr. Faulkland was not intro|duced;
&s;o that there was no room for any
thing con&s;trained or improper of either &s;ide.
I pre&s;ently recovered the little embarra&s;&s;|ment,
that his fir&s;t entrance into the room
had occa&s;ioned, I am &s;ure no body took
<PB N="222" REF="224">
notice of it; for dinner being immediately
&s;erved, there was a &s;ort of bu&s;tle in hurrying
out of the drawing-room. The crowd we
had at table de&s;troyed all conver&s;ation; and
nothing particular was &s;aid during dinner.
Lady V&mdash;&s;oon withdrew, and all her female
friends followed her. I ob&s;erved &s;he fre|quently
glanced her penetrating eyes at Mr.
Faulkland while we were at table, but I did
not chu&s;e to make any ob&s;ervations on him.
We had not been long &s;eated at our coffee,
when four of the gentlemen &s;lipped from their
company and came to us: the&s;e were Mr.
Arnold, Mr. Faulkland, and two others.
My lord is pretty free at his bottle, and none
of the&s;e gentlemen, I &s;uppo&s;e, were fond
of that entertainment. Lady V&mdash;and I
were &s;itting on a couch: I called to Mr. Ar|nold,
and placed him between us: Mr.
Faulkland approached me, and then, for
the fir&s;t time, with a re&s;pectful di&s;tance, en|quired
after my mother and Sir George, tell|ing
me he had mi&s;&s;ed of the latter, when he
was in London, being told he was at Sidney-ca&s;tle.
After a few more indifferent que&s;ti|ons,
he took a di&s;h of coffee, and retired
with it to a window. Mr. Arnold a&s;ked me
in a whi&s;per, if I was acquainted with Mr.
Faulkland; I could only an&s;wer that I was
formerly very well acquainted with him.
Nothing more pa&s;&s;ed between Mr. Faulkland
and me the whole evening: he returned &s;oon
<PB N="223" REF="225">
to the company in the next room, and I &s;aw
no more of him.</P>
<P>I can, with the utmo&s;t &s;incerity, a&s;&s;ure
my Cecilia, that I now behold Mr. Faulk|land
with as much indifference as I do any
other man of my acquaintance. Time,
joined to my own efforts, mu&s;t, without
any other help, have entirely &s;ubdued an in|clination
which was always re&s;trained by pru|dential
motives, and rendered &s;ub&s;ervient to
my duty; but I have, be&s;ides this, now ac|quired
a &s;hield that mu&s;t render me invulne|rable;
I mean the perfect and tender affection
I bear my hu&s;band: this has completely &s;e|cured
me again&s;t the mo&s;t di&s;tant apprehen|&s;ions
of being alarmed from any other quar|ter;
yet notwith&s;tanding all this, I can't &s;ay
that I am quite &s;atisfied at this renewal of my
acquaintance with Mr. Faulkland. I hope,
and indeed it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that I
have now as little intere&s;t in <HI>his</HI> heart as he
has in mine: it is but natural to believe that
a gay young man like him, &s;hould not be &s;o
weak as to nouri&s;h a hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion for
more than two years, e&s;pecially as he has
never once &s;een the object of it in all that
time; and mu&s;t, without doubt, have had
his attention engaged to others in all likeli|hood
much preferable to her; &s;o that I think
I have rea&s;on to be as ea&s;y on his account as
on my own. But &s;till am I di&s;quieted in my
mind; I have a delicacy that takes alarm at
<PB N="224" REF="226">
the verie&s;t trifles, and has been a &s;ource of
pain to me my whole life-time: it makes
me unhappy to think that I am now under
an almo&s;t unavoidable nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome|times
&s;eeing and conver&s;ing with a man,
who once had &s;uch convincing proofs, that
he was not indifferent to me.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnold's ignorance of our former
connections makes it &s;till wor&s;e. At the
time I was &s;o aver&s;e to his knowing any
thing of this affair, I flattered my&s;elf I &s;hould
never &s;ee Mr. Faulkland more, or at lea&s;t
never be obliged to have any intercour&s;e with
him; but I now lament that I did not take
my mother's advice, and di&s;clo&s;e the whole
affair at fir&s;t. Oh! my Cecilia, when the
&s;malle&s;t deviations from candor (which we
&s;uppo&s;e di&s;cretion,) are thus puni&s;hed with
remor&s;e, what mu&s;t they feel who&s;e whole
life is one continued act of di&s;&s;imulation? If
Mr. Arnold had been acquainted with my
former engagements, my heart would be
more at ea&s;e, and I &s;hould then conver&s;e
with this man with all the di&s;engaged free|dom
of a common friend. I wi&s;h Mr. Ar|nold's
curio&s;ity would excite him to a&s;k me
&s;ome que&s;tions relative to my acquaintance
with Mr. Faulkland, that I might have an
opportunity of telling him the &s;ecret. But
the enquiry he made at lady V&mdash;'s was in a
carele&s;s manner; he was &s;atisfied with my
reply, and &s;poke not of him &s;ince.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="227">
You will laugh perhaps when I tell you
that I have not courage to mention it fir&s;t:
Mr. Faulkland is reckoned a very fine gen|tleman,
and I think it would have &s;uch an
air of vanity to tell my hu&s;band that I refu&s;ed
him: then it would bring on &s;uch a train of
explanations, and poor Mi&s;s Burchell's hi&s;to|ry
mu&s;t come out; for a hu&s;band on &s;uch a
&s;ubject might be di&s;gu&s;ted with concealments
of any kind; and I doubt whether even
&s;ome circum&s;tances in my particular &s;hare of
this &s;tory might not di&s;plea&s;e him. In &s;hort,
I am bewildered, and know not what to wi&s;h
for; but mu&s;t e'en let things take their
cour&s;e, and re&s;t &s;atisfied in the integrity of
my own heart.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 26.&mdash;Oh! my dear, I am mor|tified
to the la&s;t degree, le&s;t Mr. Arnold
&s;hould, from &s;ome indi&s;creet tongue, have
received a hint of my former engagement;
he may think me di&s;ingenuous for never
having mentioned it, e&s;pecially &s;ince Mr.
Faulkland has been in the neighbourhood:
I think his nature is too open to entertain any
&s;u&s;picions e&s;&s;entially injurious to me; yet
may this affair, circum&s;tanced as it is, make
an unfavourable impre&s;&s;ion on him. I wi&s;h
I had been before-hand with any officious
whi&s;perer: he has got &s;o many new ac|quaintance,
and is &s;o much abroad, that the
&s;tory may have reached his ears, God forbid
it &s;hould affect his mind with cau&s;ele&s;s unea|&s;ine&s;s!
<PB N="226" REF="228">
fine&s;s I would Mr. Faulkland were a thou|&s;and
miles from V&mdash;hall. I think Mr. Ar|nold
is altered &s;ince his arrival there&mdash;
Colder he appears to be&mdash;I hope I but
<HI>fancy</HI> it&mdash;yet there <HI>is</HI> a change&mdash;his
looks are le&s;s kind&mdash;his voice has lo&s;t that
tenderne&s;s, that it u&s;ed to have in &s;peaking to
me&mdash;yet this may only be his temper&mdash;
a man cannot <HI>always</HI> be a lover&mdash;Oh! I
&s;icken at the very thought of Mr. Arnold's
entertaining a doubt of my true affection
for him. I would not live in this &s;u&s;pence
for millions. I would rather he &s;hould treat
me roughly&mdash;if I di&s;covered that to be
his humour, though it would frighten me,
yet &s;hould I patiently conform to it.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 30.&mdash;That which was ever
the terror of my thoughts is come upon
me&mdash;Mr. Arnold&mdash;Ah! my dear Cecilia!
Mr. Arnold is no longer the &s;ame! Coldne&s;s

a change! but the <HI>cau&s;e,</HI> my
dear, That remains a &s;ecret locked up in his
own brea&s;t. I cannot believe that a whi&s;per,
an idle rumour &s;hould affect him thus. What
if he <HI>has</HI> heard that Mr. Faulkland loved me
once? That we were to have been married?
Cannot he a&s;k me the que&s;tion? I long to &s;et
his heart at ea&s;e&mdash;yet cannot mention the af|fair
fir&s;t, after &s;o long a &s;ilence; it would

of what? I have nothing to accu&s;e my&s;elf of.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 1.&mdash;I am no longer in doubt.
&mdash;The cau&s;e, the fatal cau&s;e of Mr. Ar|nold's
change is di&s;covered. This mi&s;era|ble
day has di&s;clo&s;ed the &s;ecret to me; a
black, a complicated &s;cene of mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnold rode out this morning. He
told me he was to dine with a gentleman at
&s;ome miles di&s;tance, and &s;hould not return
till late in the evening.</P>
<P>He was but ju&s;t gone, when a lady of my
acquaintance called in upon me, to reque&s;t I
would go with her to a play, that was to
be performed at night. You mu&s;t know we
have had a company of players in the neigh|bourhood
for &s;ome time pa&s;t, and it was to
one of tho&s;e poor people's benefits that &s;he
de&s;ired my company. I promi&s;ed to attend
her, tho' you know I don't much admire
tho&s;e &s;ort of entertainments in the country,
and &s;eldom go to them.</P>
<P>The lady and her hu&s;band called upon me
at the appointed hour, and I went with them
in their coach. The place which the players
had fitted up for their purpo&s;e, had formerly
been a pretty large &s;chool room, and could,
with the addition of a gallery (which they
had made) with ea&s;e contain above three
hundred people. The play had been be&s;poke
by &s;ome of the principal ladies in the neigh|bourhood,
who had u&s;ed all their intere&s;t for
<PB N="228" REF="230">
the performer, &s;o that the hou&s;e was as full
as it could hold. The audience con&s;i&s;ting
chiefly of fa&s;hionable people, it was with dif|ficulty
that we reached the places which were
kept for us in the pit, as they happened to
be on the bench next the &s;tage, and the door
was at the other end of the hou&s;e. The fir&s;t
object that I ob&s;erved on my coming in, was
Mr. Faulkland; he bowed to me at a di&s;tance,
but made no attempts to approach me. The
play was come to the latter end of the fourth
act, and the curtain was let down to make
&s;ome preparation on the &s;tage, when we
were alarmed with the cry of fire.</P>
<P>It happened that the carpenters, who had
been employed in fitting up this extempore
theatre, had left a heap of &s;havings in a little
place behind the &s;tage, which had been con|verted
into a dre&s;&s;ing-room; a little boy be|longing
to the company had found a candle
in it, and having piled up the &s;havings, &s;et
them on fire, and left them burning: the
flame communicated it&s;elf to &s;ome dry boards
which lay in the room, and in a few minutes
the whole was in a blaze. Some per&s;ons,
who heard the crackling of wood, opened
the door, when the flame bur&s;t out with &s;uch
violence, and the &s;cenes were pre&s;ently on
fire, and the curtain, which as I told you was
dropt, &s;oon caught it.</P>
<P>The con&s;ternation and terror of the poor
people, who&s;e <HI>all</HI> was de&s;troying, is not to
<PB N="229" REF="231">
be de&s;cribed: the women &s;hrieking, threw
them&s;elves off the &s;tage into the pit, as the
&s;moke and flames terrified them from at|tempting
to get out any other way, though
there was a door behind the &s;tage.</P>
<P>The audience were in little le&s;s confu&s;ion
than they; for as the hou&s;e was compo&s;ed
chiefly of wood, every one expected it would
&s;oon be con&s;umed to a&s;hes.</P>
<P>The horror and di&s;traction of my mind
almo&s;t deprived me of the power of mo|tion.
My life was in imminent danger;
for I was &s;corched with the fire before I
could get at any di&s;tance from the &s;tage, tho'
the people were ru&s;hing out as fa&s;t as they
could.</P>
<P>The lady who was with me was exceeding|ly
frightned; but being under her hu&s;band's
care, had a little more courage than I had.
He caught her round the wai&s;t, and lifted her
over the benches, which were very high,
giving me what a&s;&s;i&s;tance he could with his
other hand. But the terror and hurry I was in
occa&s;ioned my foot to &s;lip, and I fell be|tween
two of the benches, and &s;prained my
ancle.</P>
<P>Some people pu&s;hing to get out, ru&s;hed
between me and my company; the exce&s;&s;ive
pain I felt, joined to my fright, made me
faint away; in this condition Mr. Faulkland
&s;ound me, and carried me out in his arms;
for my companion was too anxious for her
<PB N="230" REF="232">
own &s;afety, to &s;uffer her hu&s;band to &s;tay to
give me any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;o that he had only
time to beg of the men about him not to let
me peri&s;h.</P>
<P>I &s;oon recovered, upon being carried into
the open air, and found my&s;elf &s;eated on &s;ome
planks, at a little di&s;tance from the booth,
Mr. Faulkland &s;upporting me, and two or
three other people about me, whom he had
called to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Indebted to him as I was for &s;aving my life,
my &s;pirits were at that time too much agi|tated
to thank him as I ought.</P>
<P>He told me he had &s;tepped behind the
&s;cenes to &s;peak to &s;omebody, and was there
when the &s;tage took fire; that he then ran
to give what a&s;&s;i&s;tance he could to the ladies
that were in the hou&s;e (ob&s;erve he di&s;tingui&s;h|ed
not <HI>me</HI> in particular), and had ju&s;t come
in when he &s;aw me meet with the accident,
which had occa&s;ioned my fainting away; and
when the gentleman who was with me, was
calling for help, but at the &s;ame time getting
out as fa&s;t as he could.</P>
<P>I now began to recollect my&s;elf; I was
unea&s;y at Mr. Faulkland's pre&s;ence; I wi&s;hed
him away. I be&s;eeched him to return once
more to the booth, to &s;ee if every one had
got out &s;afe, for I told him I had &s;een &s;e|veral
of my female acquaintance there, for
whom I was alarmed. With the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of the people who were about me, I &s;aid I
<PB N="231" REF="233">
could make a &s;hift to get to the neare&s;t hou&s;e,
which was not above a hundred yards off,
from whence I &s;hould &s;end home for my
chariot, which I had ordered to come to me
after the play. He begged I would give
him leave to &s;ee me &s;afe to that hou&s;e, but I
would not permit him; and he left me in
the care of two women and a man, who had
come to be &s;pectators of the fire.</P>
<P>With the help of the&s;e people, I con|trived
to hobble (for my ancle pained me
exceedingly) to the place I mentioned, which
happened to be a public hou&s;e. All the
rooms below were full, and the woman of
the hou&s;e very obligingly helped me up
&s;tairs to her own chamber. I called for a gla&s;s
of water, which was immediately brought
me, and I de&s;ired the woman to &s;end &s;ome
one to my hou&s;e, which was at about a mile's
di&s;tance, to order my chariot to come to me
immediately.</P>
<P>While the woman went to execute my in|&s;tructions,
I had thrown my&s;elf into a chair
that &s;tood clo&s;e to the wain&s;cot. I heard a
bell ring, and pre&s;ently a waiter entered, and
a&s;ked if I wanted any thing; I told him,
no. He ran ha&s;tily out of the room, and
entering the next to that where I was &s;itting,
I heard a voice, which I knew to be Mr. Ar|nold's,
a&s;k, Were the &s;ervants found? The
man replying that they were not, Then, &s;aid
Mr. Arnold, tell your mi&s;tre&s;s &s;he will o|blige
<PB N="232" REF="234">
me if &s;he will let me have her chai&s;e
to carry this lady home. The waiter pre|&s;ently
withdrew, and without reflecting on
the particularity of Mr. Arnold's being there
with a lady, about whom I formed no con|jectures,
I was about to ri&s;e off my chair to
go in to him; but being almo&s;t di&s;abled
from walking, I was obliged to creep along,
holding by the wain&s;cot; when a tender ex|clamation
of Mr. Arnold's &s;topped me.
My deare&s;t creature, &s;aid he to his compani|on,
you have not yet recovered your fright.
A female voice an&s;wered him with &s;ome fond
expre&s;&s;ions, which I could not hear di&s;tinctly
enough to di&s;cover who&s;e it was; but I was
&s;oon put out of doubt, when the lady added,
in a louder tone, Do you know that your
wife was at the play to-night? Mr. Arnold
an&s;wered, No; I hope &s;he did not &s;ee me.
Mrs. Gerrarde, for I perceived it was &s;he
who &s;poke, replied, I hope not, becau&s;e
perhaps &s;he might expect you home after
the play. Though Mr. Arnold, in his fir&s;t
emotion of &s;uprrize at hearing that I was
at the play, was only anxious le&s;t I &s;hould
have ob&s;erved him, yet he was not &s;o lo&s;t
to humanity as to be indifferent whether I
e&s;caped the flames or not: I am &s;urprized I
did not &s;ee her, &s;aid he; I wi&s;h &s;he may
have got out of the hou&s;e &s;afe. You are
very &s;ollicitous about her, replied Mrs.
Gerrarde, peevi&s;hly; there was one there
<PB N="233" REF="235">
perhaps as anxious for her pre&s;ervation as
you are&mdash;The conver&s;ation I found here
was likely to become extremely critical for
me; but I was prevented from hearing any
more, by the woman of the hou&s;e, who
ju&s;t then entered the room to a&s;k me
how I did, and to know if I wanted any
thing.</P>
<P>I had heard enough to convince me that
my pre&s;ence would be very unacceptable
both to Mr. Arnold and his companion,
and I re&s;olved not to interrupt them; nor,
if po&s;&s;ible, ever let Mr. Arnold know that
I had made a di&s;covery &s;o fatal to my own
peace, and &s;o di&s;advantageous to him and
his friend.</P>
<P>The me&s;&s;enger who had been di&s;patched
for my chariot met it by the way, and was
now returned with it; I was told that it
was at the door; and it was with difficulty
I got down &s;tairs, leaning on the woman of
the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I found Mr. Faulkland at the door; he
&s;aw that I wi&s;hed to di&s;engage my&s;elf from
him after he had carried me out of the
booth; and though probably he did not take
the trouble to execute the &s;ham commi&s;&s;ion
I gave him, which was indeed with no other
view than to get him away, yet I believe
he had too much re&s;pect to intrude on me;
and came then with no other de&s;ign than to
enquire if my chariot had come for me,
<PB N="234" REF="236">
and how I was after the terrible condition
he had left me in, &s;itting at night in the
open air, with nobody but two or three
ordinary people about me, and tho&s;e &s;tran|gers.
This was a piece of civility which
humanity, had politene&s;s been out of the
que&s;tion, would have obliged him to. He
told me the fire was extingui&s;hed, and hap|pily
nobody had received any hurt; and
that he had only called at that hou&s;e to know
if I were &s;afe, and recovered from the fright
and pain he had left me in. I thanked him,
and was ju&s;t &s;tepping, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Mr. Faulk|land,
into the chariot, when Mr. Arnold
appeared at the door: he was alone; and I
concluded, that having heard the chariot rat|tle
up the court-yard, he &s;uppo&s;ed it was the
carriage he had ordered for Mrs. Gerrarde,
and came down to &s;ee if it was ready to re|ceive
her.</P>
<P>The light which the &s;ervant, who attend|ed
me out, held in his hand, immediately
di&s;covered Mr. Arnold and me to each other.
I could ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h &s;urprize mixed with
di&s;plea&s;ure in his countenance. He a&s;ked
me abruptly, How I came to that place?
Which I told him, in few words. The cold
civility of a grave bow pa&s;&s;ed between him
and Mr. Faulkland, who leaving me in my
hu&s;band's hands, wi&s;hed me a good night,
and got into my lord V&mdash;'s coach, which
waited for him.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="237">
Though I knew, from the di&s;cour&s;e I had
overheard, that Mr. Arnold did not mean to
go home with me, yet as I was now &s;eated
in the chariot, I could not avoid a&s;king him.
He told me, he was engaged to &s;up with
company at that hou&s;e, and that probably he
&s;hould not be at home till late. I knew this
beforehand, and, without troubling him
with any farther que&s;tions, drove home.</P>
<P>I have thrown together the &s;trange occur|rences
of this evening, as well as the tu|mult
of my &s;pirits would give me leave:
I &s;hall now lay down my pen, to con&s;ider of
them a little more calmly. My heart &s;inks
in me&mdash;Oh! that I had remained in igno|rance!&mdash;</P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible, my Cecilia, that Mr. Ar|nold,
&s;o good a man, one who married me
too for love, and who for the&s;e two years
has been the tendere&s;t, the kinde&s;t hu&s;band,
and to whom I never gave the mo&s;t di&s;tant
&s;hadow of offence, &s;hould at la&s;t be led
into&mdash;I cannot name it&mdash;dare not think
of it&mdash;yet a hundred circum&s;tances recur
to my memory, which now convince me I
am unhappy! If I had not been blind, I
might have &s;een it &s;ooner. I recollect &s;ome
pa&s;&s;ages, which &s;atisfy me that Mr. Arnold's
acquaintance with Mrs. Gerrarde did not
commence at South-park. I remember lady
V&mdash;once a&s;ked me, had &s;he and I
been acquainted in London? I &s;aid, No.
<PB N="236" REF="238">
My lord laughed, and in his blunt way &s;aid,
I will &s;wear your hu&s;band was, for I have
&s;een him hand her out from the play more
than once. I never a&s;ked Mr. Arnold about
this; it made no impre&s;&s;ion on me at the
time it was &s;poke, and went quick out of my
thoughts.</P>
<P>'Tis one o'clock: I hear Mr. Arnold ring
at the outer gate; I tremble all over, and
feel as if I feared to &s;ee him. Yet why &s;hould
I fear? <HI>I</HI> have not injured <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 2.&mdash;Mr. Arnold &s;taid long
enough in his dre&s;&s;ing-room after he came in
la&s;t night, to give me time to go to-bed be|fore
he came up &s;tairs. Not a word pa&s;&s;ed
between us: I &s;lept not the whole night:
whether he did or not I cannot tell. He
a&s;ked me this morning, when he ro&s;e, how
I did: I told him in great pain. My ancle
was prodigiou&s;ly &s;welled, and turned quite
black, for I had neglected it la&s;t night. He
&s;aid, you had better let a &s;urgeon &s;ee it, and
went carele&s;sly out of the room. How new
is unkindne&s;s to me, my friend! you know
I have not been u&s;ed to it. Mr. Arnold adds
cruelty too&mdash;but let it be &s;o; far be
reproaches or complaints from my lips; to
you only, my &s;econd &s;elf, &s;hall I utter them;
to you I am bound by &s;olemn promi&s;e, and
reciprocal confidence, to di&s;clo&s;e the inmo&s;t
&s;ecrets of my &s;oul, and with you they are as
&s;afe as in my own brea&s;t.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="239">
I am once more compo&s;ed, and deter|mined
on my behaviour. I have not a doubt
remaining of Mr. Arnold's infidelity; but
let me not aggravate my own griefs, nor
to a vicious world ju&s;tify my hu&s;band's con|duct,
by bringing any reproach on my
own. The &s;ilent &s;ufferings of the injured,
mu&s;t, to a mind not ungenerous, be a &s;har|per
rebuke than it is in the power of language
to inflict.</P>
<P>But this is not all: I mu&s;t endeavour, if
po&s;&s;ible, to &s;kreen Mr. Arnold from cen&s;ure.
I hope his own imprudence may not render
the&s;e endeavours ineffectual. I am re&s;olved
not to drop my acquaintance with Mrs. Ger|rarde.
While we continue upon a footing
of &s;eeming intimacy, the frequent vi&s;its,
which I am &s;ure Mr. Arnold makes at her
hou&s;e, will be le&s;s taken notice of.</P>
<P>How Sir George would triumph at the
knowledge of Mr. Arnold's deviating from
virtue! How my poor mother would be
amazed and afflicted! But I will, as far as
lies in my power, di&s;appoint the malice of
my &s;tars; my mother &s;hall have no cau&s;e to
grieve, nor my brother to rejoice; the &s;ecret
&s;hall die with me in my own bo&s;om, and I
will wait patiently, 'till the hand of time ap|plies
a remedy to my grief.&mdash;Mrs. Ger|rarde
&s;ent a me&s;&s;age to enquire how I did.
Con&s;cious woman! &s;he would not come her|&s;elf,
<PB N="238" REF="240">
though &s;he knew not I had di&s;covered
her.</P>
<P>My dear good lady V&mdash;hurried to
&s;ee me the in&s;tant &s;he had breakfa&s;ted: Mr.
Faulkland had told her of my di&s;a&s;ter,
and her tenderne&s;s &s;oothed and comforted
me much. She &s;at by my bed-&s;ide two
hours, and her di&s;cour&s;e alleviated the pain
both of my mind and body; but now &s;he
has left me, I mu&s;t again recur to the &s;ub|ject
that wrings my heart. Mr. Arnold is
en&s;laved to one of the mo&s;t artful of her
&s;ex. I look upon his attachment to be
the more dangerous, as I believe it is the
fir&s;t of the kind he ever had; and no wo|man
was ever more formed to plea&s;e and to
deceive, than &s;he who now holds him in her
chains. Into what hands am I fallen! Mrs.
Gerrarde mu&s;t have heard my &s;tory, and
by the hint I heard her drop, what cruel
mi&s;repre&s;entations may &s;he have made to Mr.
Arnold! Mr. Faulkland, &s;he can have no
enmity to; but me &s;he certainly hates, for &s;he
has injured me.</P>
<P>'Tis noon: I have not &s;een Mr. Arnold
&s;ince morning; he has been abroad ever &s;ince
he ro&s;e; Good God! is this the life I am
condemned to lead?</P>
<P>A new &s;cene of affliction is opened to me:
&s;urely my fate is drawing towards a cri&s;is.
Mr. Arnold has ju&s;t left me. What a con|ver&s;ation
have we had!</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="241">
After entering my room, he walked about
for &s;ome minutes without &s;peaking; at la&s;t
&s;topping &s;hort, and fixing his eyes upon me,
How long have you, &s;aid he, been acquaint|ed
with Mr. Faulkland? I told him my ac|quaintance
began with him &s;ome months be|fore
I was married. He was once your lo|ver,
I am informed. He was, and a treaty
of marriage was concluded on between us.
You would have been happier perhaps, ma|dam,
if it had taken place. I do not think
&s;o, Mr. Arnold, you have no rea&s;on to &s;up|po&s;e
I do. I had a very great objection to
Mr. Faulkland, and obeyed my mother
willingly, when &s;he forbid me to &s;ee him.
I a&s;k not what that objection was, &s;aid he;
but I &s;uppo&s;e, madam, you will without
reluctance obey <HI>me,</HI> if I make the &s;ame re|que&s;t
to you. Mo&s;t chearfully; you cannot
make a reque&s;t with which I &s;hould more
readily comply. But let me be&s;eech you,
Mr. Arnold, to tell me, what part of my
behaviour has given you cau&s;e to think &s;uch
a prohibition nece&s;&s;ary? I do not &s;ay, an|&s;wered
Mr. Arnold, that I have any &s;u&s;picion
of your virtue; but your acquie&s;cence in
this particular is nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>my</HI> peace and
your <HI>own</HI> honour. A lady's being <HI>married</HI>
does not cut off the hopes of a gay man.
You give me your promi&s;e that you will not
&s;ee him any more. I <HI>do,</HI> &s;aid I; I will give
up lady V&mdash;, who&s;e acquaintance I &s;o much
<PB N="240" REF="242">
e&s;teem: I will go no more to the hou&s;e while
Mr. Faulkland continues there; and I know
of no other family, where I vi&s;it, that he
is acquainted with.</P>
<P>My pride would not &s;uffer me to enquire
where he had got his information: I already
knew it too well; and fearing he would
rather de&s;cend to an untruth than tell me his
author, I declined any farther que&s;tions.
He &s;eemed &s;atisfied with my promi&s;e, but
quickly left me, as if the whole end of his
vi&s;it to me was accompli&s;hed in having ob|tained
it.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 8.&mdash;What painful minutes
am I obliged to &s;u&s;tain! Mrs. Gerrarde has
been to &s;ee me, gay and a&s;&s;ured as ever.
She affected to condole with me on the ac|cident
that had happened to my foot, with
&s;uch an over&s;trained concern, &s;uch a tender
&s;olicitude, that her in&s;incerity di&s;gu&s;ted me,
if po&s;&s;ible, more than the other part of her
behaviour. She told me, &s;he her&s;elf had
been at the play, but very luckily had got
out without receiving any injury. I &s;aid, I
was &s;urprized I had not &s;een her there. O,
replied &s;he, I was in a little &s;nug corner,
where nobody could &s;ee me; for having
refu&s;ed to go with &s;ome ladies that a&s;ked
me, I did not chu&s;e to be vi&s;ible in the
hou&s;e, and &s;o &s;queezed my&s;elf up into what
they called their gallery, for I took nobody
with me but my maid. Audacious woman!
<PB N="241" REF="243">
&mdash;Is it not &s;trange, my dear, that Mr.
Arnold could be &s;o weak as to humour her
in the ab&s;urd frolick of going with her to
&s;uch a place; for &s;o it mu&s;t have been; or
perhaps &s;he appointed him only to call for
her at the play; and he might have arrived
but ju&s;t in time to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in getting out.
No matter which it was.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 9.&mdash;I was born to &s;acrifice my
own peace to that of other people; my life
is become mi&s;erable, but I have no remedy
for it but patience.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnold &s;pends whole days abroad; at
night we are &s;eparated on account of my in|di&s;po&s;ition;
&s;o that we hardly ever conver&s;e
together. What a dreadful pro&s;pect have I
before me! O! Cecilia, may you never ex|perience
the bitterne&s;s of having your hu&s;|band's
heart alienated from you!</P>
<P>Lady V&mdash;, that be&s;t of creatures, is
with me con&s;tantly; &s;he pre&s;&s;es me to come
to her hou&s;e, as my ancle is now pretty
well, yet I am obliged to excu&s;e my&s;elf. I
am di&s;tre&s;&s;ed to the la&s;t degree at the conduct
I &s;hall be forced to ob&s;erve towards her,
yet dare not explain the motive. Cau&s;ele&s;s
jealou&s;y is always the &s;ubject of ridicule, and
at all events Mr. Arnold mu&s;t not be expo&s;ed
to this.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 12.&mdash;I am weary of invent|ing
excu&s;es for ab&s;enting my&s;elf from
V&mdash;hall. My lady has done &s;olliciting
<PB N="242" REF="244">
me, yet continues her friendly and affection|ate
vi&s;its; I fear &s;he gue&s;&s;es my &s;ituation,
though &s;he has not as yet hinted at it; but
her forbearing to pre&s;s me any more on the
&s;ubject of going to her, and at the &s;ame
time not requiring a rea&s;on for this breach of
civility as well as friend&s;hip, convinces me,
that &s;he &s;u&s;pects the cau&s;e of my re&s;traint.
I am now perfectly recovered, yet do I &s;till
confine my&s;elf to my hou&s;e, to avoid as
much as po&s;&s;ible giving umbrage to lady
V&mdash;: but this re&s;traint cannot la&s;t much
longer; Mrs. Gerrarde teazes me to come to
her, and I have promi&s;ed to make her my
fir&s;t vi&s;it.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 27.&mdash;Said I not that my fate
was near its cri&s;is? Where will this impend|ing
ruin end? Take, my Cecilia, the occur|rences
of this frightful day.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnold rode out this morning, and
told me he &s;hould not return 'till night.
He a&s;ked me, with that indifference which
now accompanies all his words, How I
meant to di&s;po&s;e of my&s;elf for the day? I
told him I had no de&s;ign of going abroad,
and &s;hould &s;pend my time in reading, or at
my needle. This was my real intention;
but Mr. Arnold had but ju&s;t left the hou&s;e,
when I received a me&s;&s;age from Mrs. Gerrarde
to know how I did, and to tell me &s;he was
not well, and much out of &s;pirits, or &s;he
would come and pa&s;s the day with me; but
<PB N="243" REF="245">
that &s;he in&s;i&s;ted on my dining with her. As
I had told Mr. Arnold I did not mean to go
out, I really had neither intention nor incli|nation
to do &s;o. But &s;hall I confe&s;s my weak|ne&s;s
to you? I &s;u&s;pected that he purpo&s;ed
&s;pending the day (as he often did) with Mrs.
Gerrarde, and the more &s;o from the que&s;tion
he had a&s;ked me on his going abroad; he
thought I might probably pay her a vi&s;it; and
this intru&s;ion was a circum&s;tance he had a
mind to be guarded again&s;t, by knowing be|forehand
my de&s;igns, I had not been to &s;ee
Mrs. Gerrarde &s;ince my recovery, and it was
natural to &s;uppo&s;e I would return her vi&s;its.
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as I was with this opinion, her
me&s;&s;age gave me a &s;ecret &s;atisfaction, as it
&s;erved to convince me Mr. Arnold was not
to be with her, for &s;he generally detained me
late when I went to her hou&s;e. From what
trivial circum&s;tances will the afflicted draw
con&s;olation, or an additional weight of grief?
So it was, I felt a &s;ort of plea&s;ure, in think|ing,
that for all that day at lea&s;t Mr. Arnold
would ab&s;ent him&s;elf from my rival.&mdash;My
rival! mean word, &s;he is not worthy to be
called &s;o; from his mi&s;tre&s;s let it be. In
&s;hort, I re&s;olved to go, e&s;pecially as &s;he had
&s;ent me word &s;he was not well, and I knew
my hu&s;band would be plea&s;ed with my com|plai&s;ance.</P>
<P>I went accordingly to her hou&s;e, a little
before her hour of dining, which is much
<PB N="244" REF="246">
later than any body's el&s;e in this part of the
world. I found her dre&s;&s;ed out, and &s;eem|ingly
in perfect health. She looked &s;ur|prized
when &s;he &s;aw me; and I then &s;up|po&s;ed
that &s;he hoped to have received a de|nial
from me, and was di&s;appointed at my
coming; though I wondered that the an&s;wer
&s;he received to her me&s;&s;age had not prepared
her. This thought ru&s;hed into my mind in
an in&s;tant, and I was &s;ure &s;he expected Mr.
Arnold. I told her if I had thought I &s;hould
have found her &s;o well, that her me&s;&s;age
&s;hould not have brought me to her; for that
I had determined not to &s;tir out that day,
'till her invitation prevailed on me to change
my mind. Sure, my dear, &s;aid &s;he, there
mu&s;t have been &s;ome mi&s;take in delivering
the me&s;&s;age to you, it was for to-morrow I
de&s;ired the plea&s;ure of your company to dine
with me; for to-day I am ab&s;olutely en|gaged.
However, I am very glad you are
come, for I &s;hall not go out 'till &s;even
o'clock. I was vexed and mortified; either
your &s;ervant or mine made a mi&s;take, &s;aid
I, for I was told you de&s;ired to &s;ee me today; be&s;ides you &s;ent me word you were
not well. She &s;eemed a little aba&s;hed at
this: I <HI>was</HI> very ill in the morning, &s;he &s;aid;
and though I was engaged to &s;pend the
evening abroad, did intend to have &s;ent an
$$cu&s;e; but finding my&s;elf better, I changed
$$ purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="247">
Dinner was immediately &s;erved, and I
&s;at down, but with a reluctance that pre|vented
me from eating. I would have taken
my leave &s;oon after dinner, but Mrs. Gerrarde
in&s;i&s;ted on my &s;taying, and told me, if I re|fu&s;ed
her, &s;he &s;hould think I had taken &s;ome|thing
ami&s;s of her. She called for cards; I
&s;uffered my&s;elf to be per&s;uaded, and we fell
to piquet.</P>
<P>I played with di&s;gu&s;t, and without atten|tion,
every minute wi&s;hing to break away.
Coffee was at length brought in; I begged
to be excu&s;ed from &s;taying, telling Mrs.
Gerrarde, I was &s;ure I prevented her from
going abroad, but &s;he would take no denial.
I was con&s;trained to take a di&s;h of coffee,
and was ha&s;tening to get it down when the
parlour door flew open, and lo! Mr. Faulk|land
entered the room. If an object the
mo&s;t horrible to human nature had appeared
before me, it could not, at that in&s;tant, have
&s;hocked me half &s;o much. I let the cup and
&s;aucer drop from my hand: to &s;ay I turned
pale, trembled, and was ready to faint, would
be too feeble a de&s;cription of the effect this
&s;pectre had on me. I was &s;en&s;ele&s;s, I almo&s;t
died away. Mrs. Gerrarde pretended to be
greatly alarmed; &s;he ran for drops, and
having given me a few in a gla&s;s of water,
I made a &s;hift to ri&s;e off my chair, and
telling her, I &s;hould be glad of a little air,
tottered to the &s;treet-door. I determined to
<PB N="246" REF="248">
go home directly, but the univer&s;al tremor I
was now in, di&s;abled me from walking, and
I &s;at down in the porch to recover my&s;elf a
little. Mr. Faulkland's having been a wit|ne&s;s
to the agony his pre&s;ence had thrown me
into, did not a little aggravate the horror
and confu&s;ion of my thoughts. Whatever
<HI>his</HI> were, he had not &s;poke to me, nor was
it po&s;&s;ible for me to have remarked his beha|viour:
I &s;taid not more than two minutes
in the parlour after he entered. In this &s;itu|ation
you will think my di&s;tre&s;s would hard|ly
admit of any addition; but the final
blow was yet to come. Mrs. Gerrarde had
&s;taid a minute in the parlour to &s;peak to Mr.
Faulkland after I went out, but pre&s;ently
followed me, and was &s;oothing me with
the kinde&s;t expre&s;&s;ions, when I heard the
trampling of hor&s;es, and pre&s;ently beheld
Mr. Arnold alighting at the door. I now
gave my&s;elf up for lo&s;t. My mind &s;uddenly
&s;ugge&s;ted to me that Mrs. Gerrarde had con|trived
a plot upon my innocence; but how
&s;he had been able to bring it about, my
thoughts were not then di&s;engaged enough
to conceive. My mind was all a chaos; I
was not able to an&s;wer Mr. Arnold when he
&s;poke to me. He &s;oon perceived my di&s;or|der,
and enquired the cau&s;e. Mrs. Gerrarde
took upon her to an&s;wer, that I was ju&s;t
preparing to go home, when I was taken
&s;uddenly ill. I was going abroad, &s;aid &s;he,
<PB N="247" REF="249">
and as I ordered the chariot much about this
hour, I fancy it is ready, and may as well
carry Mrs. Arnold home; you had be&s;t &s;tep
into the parlour, my dear, (to me) 'till it is
brought to the door.</P>
<P>I am now able to walk, madam, &s;aid I;
there is no occa&s;ion to give you that trouble.
Mr. Arnold &s;aid, I &s;hould not walk by any
means; and Mrs. Gerrarde immediately
calling to a &s;ervant to order the chariot to
the door, &s;aid, as &s;he was going out, &s;he
would leave me at home her&s;elf. Mr. Ar|nold
an&s;wered, it would be the be&s;t way,
and that he &s;hould follow &s;oon. The cha|riot
was pre&s;ently at the door, and I was pre|paring
to get into it, when Mrs. Gerrarde
cry'd, Ble&s;s me, I had forgot, it will not be
&s;o civil to leave the gentleman behind, with|out
&s;aying any thing to him. Mr. Arnold
ha&s;tily a&s;ked, What Gentleman? Mrs. Ger|rarde
replied, Mr. Faulkland, <HI>who took it
into his head</HI> to make me a vi&s;it this evening.
She went quickly into the parlour, and &s;trait
returned with Mr. Faulkland; who bowing
carele&s;ly to Mr. Arnold, and civilly to me,
walked away.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gerrarde &s;tepped into the chariot to
me, and ordered it to drive to my hou&s;e,
leaving Mr. Arnold &s;tanding motionle&s;s at
her door.</P>
<P>A total &s;ilence prevailed on my &s;ide dure|ing
our &s;hort journey home, except to an|&s;wer
<PB N="248" REF="250">
in mono&s;yllables Mrs. Gerrarde's re|peated
enquiries after my health. She &s;et
me down at my door, and took her leave
without alighting. When I found my&s;elf
alone, I began to con&s;ider the con&s;equences
of this evening's fatal interview; an inter|view,
which, though unthought of by me,
I judged was contrived to en&s;nare me. I
laid all the circum&s;tances together, and en|deavoured
to unravel the clue. 'Tis plain to
me Mr. Arnold was expected by Mrs. Ger|rarde
this evening. She &s;ent for me on
purpo&s;e to betray me; the me&s;&s;age, which
&s;he pretended was delivered wrong, was
only an artifice, in order to impo&s;e on Mr.
Arnold, that he might imagine &s;he did not
expect me. Indeed, he could not po&s;&s;ibly
think &s;he &s;hould &s;end for me on the very
evening he was to be with her; and &s;he
had &s;o well guarded her contrivance, that it
was not ea&s;ily to be detected. She had &s;ent
her me&s;&s;age by word of mouth, though &s;he
generally wrote them down on paper, but
this way would not have been liable to mi&s;|con&s;truction:
&s;he had told me &s;he was en|gaged
in the evening, yet detained me
longer than I meant to &s;tay. From the fir&s;t
of the&s;e circum&s;tances, it mu&s;t appear to
Mr. Arnold, that as I had come unwi&s;hed|for,
&s;he wanted to get rid of me; the lat|ter
obviou&s;ly &s;erved her own purpo&s;e; for it
is as clear as daylight, that &s;he laid her plan
<PB N="249" REF="251">
&s;o as that Mr. Arnold &s;hould find Mr.
Faulkland and me together. All this I have
deduced from a long train of rea&s;oning on
the circum&s;tances. But the inexplicable part
of the my&s;tery is how &s;he contrived to get
Mr. Faulkland, with whom I did not think
&s;he was acquainted, to vi&s;it her at &s;o fatally
critical a juncture. Sure &s;ome evil &s;pirit
mu&s;t have a&s;&s;i&s;ted her in this wicked &s;cheme:
&s;he knew, no doubt, of the promi&s;e Mr.
Arnold had exacted of me, never to &s;ee
him. The apparent breach of this promi&s;e,
&s;he may have art enough to per&s;uade Mr.
Arnold was concerted on my &s;ide. But I
hope I &s;hall be able to clear my&s;elf of this
cruel imputation to my hu&s;band. Truth
<HI>mu&s;t</HI> force its way into his mind, if he is
not re&s;olved on my de&s;truction. Perhaps
Mr. Faulkland may be &s;ecretly Mrs. Ger|rarde's
admirer, and Mr. Arnold is the dupe
to her perfidy, as I am the &s;acrifice to her
malice and licentiou&s;ne&s;s.&mdash;'Tis all a
&s;trange riddle, but I cannot remain long in
this di&s;mal &s;tate of &s;u&s;pence; Mr. Arnold,
perhaps, may di&s;cover her treachery, while
&s;he is endeavouring to de&s;troy me in his good
opinion.</P>
<P>I am waiting here like a poor criminal, in
expectation of appearing before my judge. I
wi&s;h Mr. Arnold were come in, yet I dread
to &s;ee him.</P>
<P>I might have &s;pared my&s;elf the anxiety.
<PB N="250" REF="252">
Mr. Arnold is ju&s;t returned, but he has
locked him&s;elf into another chamber. I
will not mole&s;t him to night; to-morrow,
perhaps, he may be in better temper, and
I may be able to ju&s;tify my&s;elf to him,
and di&s;pel this frightful gloom that hangs
over us.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 13.&mdash;Hopes and fears are at
an end, and the mea&s;ure of my afflictions is
filled up.</P>
<P>I went to bed la&s;t night, but &s;lept not;
the hours were pa&s;&s;ed in agonies not to be
de&s;cribed. I think all griefs are magnified
by &s;ilence and darkne&s;s. I well knew, pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
as Mr. Arnold was by my artful
enemy, I &s;hould find it difficult to excu&s;e
my&s;elf, or per&s;uade him, that chance, or
Mrs. Gerrarde's more wicked contrivance,
had been the &s;ole cau&s;e of what had given
him &s;uch offence. I was re&s;olved, however,
to vindicate my innocence, and was, in my
own thoughts, preparing my defence the
greate&s;t part of the night. Towards morn|ing,
wearine&s;s and grief overpowered me,
and I fell a&s;leep, but I enjoyed not this re|po&s;e
long. Some noi&s;e that was made in
the hou&s;e &s;uddenly awakened me; I &s;aw it
was broad day, and looking at my watch,
found it was pa&s;t &s;even o'clock. I rang my
bell, and Patty entering my room, I en|quired
if her ma&s;ter was yet &s;tirring. The
poor girl looked agha&s;t, He is gone away on
<PB N="251" REF="253">
hor&s;eback, madam, &s;aid &s;he, almo&s;t two
hours ago; and he ordered his man to put
up &s;ome linen and a few other things in a
&s;mall portmanteau. I believe he means not
to return to-night; for he bid me to deliver
this letter to you. I opened the letter with
trembling hands, from whence I received my
doom in the following words:</P>
<P>&startq;You have broke your faith with me, in
&s;eeing the man whom I forbad you to &s;ee,
and whom you &s;o &s;olemnly promi&s;ed to a|void.
As you have betrayed my confidence
in this particular, I can no longer rely on
your prudence, or your fidelity. Whatever
your de&s;igns may be, it will be le&s;s to my
di&s;honour if you pro&s;ecute them from under
your hu&s;band's roof. I therefore give you
'till this day &s;e'nnight to con&s;ider of a place
for your future abode; for one hou&s;e mu&s;t
no more contain two people, who&s;e hearts
are divided. Our children remain with me,
and the &s;ettlement which was made on you
in marriage, &s;hall be appropriated to your
&s;eparate u&s;e.</P>
<P>&startq;I have left home to avoid expo&s;tulati|ons,
nor &s;hall I return to it 'till I hear you
have removed your&s;elf. Spare the attempt
of a ju&s;tification, which can only aggravate
the re&s;entment of your already too-much in|jured
hu&s;band.&endq;</P>
<P>I have for a while &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the tu|mult
<PB N="252" REF="254">
in my &s;oul, to give you this &s;hocking
letter.</P>
<P>O my Cecilia! What a wretched lot is
thy unhappy friend's! To be neglected, for|&s;aken,
de&s;pi&s;ed, by a hu&s;band that I love!
Yet I could bear that: but to be &s;u&s;pected,
accu&s;ed too! to be at once the mi&s;erable ob|ject
of jealou&s;y and &s;corn! Surely they know
nothing of the human heart, who &s;ay that
jealou&s;y cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without affection; I
have a fatal proof to the contrary. Mr. Ar|nold
loves me not, yet doubts my honour.
Cruel, mean, dete&s;table &s;u&s;picion! Oh that
vile woman! 'tis &s;he has done this; like a
per&s;ecuting daemon &s;he urges on the ruin
which &s;he &s;et on foot.</P>
<P>What can I do? Whither can I fly? I
cannot remain here any longer; my pre|&s;ence
bani&s;hes Mr. Arnold from his home.
If I go to my mother under &s;uch circum|&s;tances,
it will break her heart; yet &s;he mu&s;t
know it. I mu&s;t not wait to be turned out
of my own doors. That thought is not to
be borne. I will go this in&s;tant, no matter
whither.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 15.&mdash;God pre&s;erve me in
my &s;en&s;es! I have pa&s;&s;ed two days and two
nights I know not how; in &s;ilence and with|out
food, Patty tells me. But I think I am
a little recovered. I will write to my mo|ther,
and beg of her to open her arms to
<PB N="253" REF="255">
receive her mi&s;erable child. I am collected
enough, and know what to &s;ay.</P>
<P>I had ju&s;t di&s;patched my letter, incohe|rent
as it is, and blotted with my tears, when
Patty brought me $word$ that had come by the
po&s;t. I knew my dear mother's hand on
the &s;uper&s;cription, and ki&s;&s;ed it before I
opened it. See, my &s;i&s;ter, how the tender|e&s;t
of parents writes to her unhappy child,
whom &s;he fondly believes to be the darling
of her hu&s;band, and ble&s;&s;ed with dome&s;tic
felicity.</P>

incommode you, but &s;hall content my&s;elf
with waiting your arrival in town, at your
hou&s;e in St. James's-&s;treet; but do not
<PB N="254" REF="256">
ha&s;ten your departure from the country on
this account. I am in no immediate danger,

God prolongs my life, what joy will it be to
me to &s;pend next winter with my darling, and
her dear good Arnold, and to fea&s;t my eyes

<P>If I am called from you, I &s;hall have the
comfort of my child's affectionate hands to
clo&s;e my eyes; and &s;hall leave the world
without regret, as I have lived to &s;ee my

</LETTER>
<P>My heart is bur&s;ting&mdash;O. Cecilia!
What will become of my fond, my dear
venerable parent, when &s;he finds this daugh|ter,
<PB N="255" REF="257">
this comfort of her age, this beloved of
her &s;oul, a poor abandoned outca&s;t; lo&s;t
to her hu&s;band's love, turned out of his
doors, de&s;pi&s;ed, di&s;graced! My children
too&mdash;I mu&s;t leave them behind&mdash;
My God, for what calamities ha&s;t thou or|dained
thy creature! Tears, tears, you may
well flow!</P>
<P>So! I am relieved, and will endeavour
to fortify my &s;oul again&s;t the two events,
that appear to me horrid as an approaching
execution to a guilty wretch, the parting
with my children, and the meeting with
my mother. As the letter I wrote will mi&s;s
of her at Sidney-ca&s;tle, I &s;hall write to
London, to prepare her to receive the wretch
whom her imagination has figured to her &s;o
happy.</P>
<P>Lady V&mdash;! I hear her coming up &s;tairs
&mdash;I cannot conceal my affliction, nor my
di&s;grace.</P>
<P>Lady V&mdash;has left me: left me in a|&s;toni&s;hment
and new horror. Mrs. Ger|rarde!
Who do you think Mrs. Gerrarde
is? She is the aunt of Mi&s;s Burchell, that
aunt who betrayed her to de&s;truction. Sure
this woman was &s;ent into the world for a
&s;courge!</P>
<P>I cannot collect my&s;elf to tell you with
any method, the conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed
between lady V&mdash;and me. She found
me with the marks of tears on my face;
<PB N="256" REF="258">
they &s;treamed again at the &s;ight of her; I
could not conceal the cau&s;e, and I put Mr.
Arnold's letter into her hands, for I was not
able to tell her the purport of it.</P>
<P>This is Mrs. Gerrarde's doing, &s;aid &s;he,
the dete&s;table creature! How could &s;he
work on your infatuated hu&s;band, to drive
him &s;uch horrid lengths? I know not, &s;aid
I, but I hope my lady V&mdash;believes me
innocent. Innocent, &s;he exclaimed! My
dear creature, your &s;ufferings almo&s;t make
me mad. Do you know that Mrs. Ger|rarde
has an intrigue with your hu&s;band?
I fear &s;o, madam, I replied, but I hoped it
was not publick. Poor child, &s;aid lady
V&mdash;, his attachment to her has been
no &s;ecret, ever &s;ince he came down to this
country, though probably you were the la&s;t
to &s;u&s;pect it. I have often dreaded the con|&s;equences
of it, but never imagined it would
have come to this; I always had a bad opi|nion
of the woman, and only kept up a face
of civility to her in her hu&s;band's time, on
account of her niece, a charming girl that
then lived with her; but &s;ince Mi&s;s Burchell
has left her, I have almo&s;t dropt my acquaint|ance
with her; though my lord, who had an
old friend&s;hip for captain Gerrarde, per&s;uades
me to be civil to her.</P>
<P>The name of mi&s;s Burchell had &s;truck me
&s;peechle&s;s. The clue was now unravelled.
With what an unremitting zeal has this ba&s;e
<PB N="257" REF="259">
woman gone on in her career of iniquity?
Lady V&mdash;, who was intirely taken up with
the thoughts of my unhappine&s;s, took no
notice of my &s;ilence or confu&s;ion. What
do you mean to do, my dear Mrs. Arnold,
&s;aid &s;he? Do you think it is not po&s;&s;ible,
by the interpo&s;ition of friends, to di&s;abu&s;e
your unfortunate hu&s;band? For unfortunate
he is, in a higher degree than your&s;elf, as
you have con&s;cious innocence to &s;upport you.
Oh madam, &s;aid I, it is in vain to think of
it! Mrs. Gerrarde has &s;truck the blow ef|fectually.
Were Mr. Arnold left to the
workings of his own heart, he might, per|haps,
relent; but that woman, like my
evil genius and his, will take care to keep his
&s;u&s;picions alive. She po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es his whole
heart, and my removal is become nece&s;&s;ary,
to the quiet of them both. I have taken my
re&s;olution, I will immediately quit this hou&s;e,
and leave it to a righteous God to vindi|cate
me in his own time. You &s;hould go
no where but to my hou&s;e, &s;aid lady V&mdash;,
with tears in her eyes, but that I think it
an improper &s;ituation for you, while Mr.
Faulkland is my gue&s;t. He will be di&s;tract|ed
when he hears of this. I conjured lady
V&mdash;not to tell him: My being parted
from my hu&s;band cannot long be a &s;ecret,
&s;aid I, but the cau&s;e may. Lady V&mdash;
told me that Mr. Faulkland had that very
morning &s;et out for Sidney-ca&s;tle, to &s;ee my
<PB N="258" REF="260">
brother; having received a letter from him
the day before, in which he told him that
my mother was going in a day or two to
London, and begged he would come and
&s;pend a week with him. She added, Mr.
Faulkland purpo&s;ed doing &s;o, and then to
return to V&mdash;hall, as my lord had ob|tained
a promi&s;e from him to &s;tay &s;ome
time longer with them; at lea&s;t 'till the old
lady's affairs were &s;ettled, who had left her
fortune to Mr. Faulkland, and to whom my
Lord V&mdash;was executor.</P>
<P>I told lady V&mdash;I depended on her friend|&s;hip,
to keep this affair a &s;ecret from Mr.
Faulkland, le&s;t the heat of his temper
&s;hould make him take &s;uch notice of it, as
might render my &s;eparation from Mr. Ar|nold
doubly injurious to my character. La|dy
V&mdash;&s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of this caution,
and promi&s;ed to ob&s;erve it. She expre&s;&s;ed
great &s;urprize at Mr. Faulkland's vi&s;iting
Mrs. Gerrarde, whom &s;he &s;aid, &s;he did not
imagine he had been acquainted with. He
is no &s;tranger, &s;aid &s;he, to your hu&s;band's
amour with her, as it has often been a topic
of di&s;cour&s;e between my lord and me; and
I can hardly think he would be &s;o indelicate
as to carry on a love-affair with &s;uch an a|bandoned
creature; e&s;pecially as I have often
heard him expre&s;s the utmo&s;t dete&s;tation of
her, on account of her robbing you of your
hu&s;band's affection; which I had ob&s;erved
<PB N="259" REF="261">
for a good while. But there is no knowing
mankind, added &s;he: if that &s;hould be the
ca&s;e, you may depend upon it that vile Ger|rarde
has laid her plan deeper than we are
aware of, and would out-&s;wear us all, that
Faulkland came to her hou&s;e for no other
purpo&s;e, than to have an opportunity of &s;ee|ing
you; who to be &s;ure, &s;he &s;aid, had
given him a private hint to meet you there.
Now the wor&s;t of it is, it is impo&s;&s;ible to
have this matter cleared up to your hu&s;band,
without Mr. Faulkland's concurrence, and
that you will not con&s;ent to. By no means,
I replied, I would not for the world have
Mr. Faulkland interfere in my ju&s;tification.
If the affair &s;hould really be as you have
&s;ugge&s;ted, a little time may, perhaps, di&s;|cover
this wicked woman to Mr. Arnold,
and it will not then be &s;o difficult to clear my
innocence. At pre&s;ent, her influence over
him is too powerful for me to combat with;
and I know he wi&s;hes for nothing more than
to free him&s;elf from the re&s;traint that my
pre&s;ence lays him under.</P>
<P>Lady V&mdash;acquie&s;ced in my opinion, and
&s;aid, &s;he hoped a little time would chace
away the dark cloud that now hung over
me. She &s;taid with me the whole day; it
was a day of tears: the dear woman was
quite &s;ubdued at parting with me. I &s;ee
you no more, dear lady V&mdash;, &s;aid I, I &s;hall
go to London in two days&mdash;Pre&s;erve
<PB N="260" REF="262">
your fortitude, deare&s;t Mrs. Arnold, &s;he re|plied;
the time will come when your hu&s;|band
will repent of the bitter di&s;tre&s;s he has
occa&s;ioned to you: my lord and I will u&s;e
our utmo&s;t endeavours to convince him of
his error.&mdash;We &s;hall meet in London,
my dear, I &s;hall go thither early in the winter
on purpo&s;e&mdash;Have courage&mdash;Your inno|cence
<HI>mu&s;t</HI> be cleared. I an&s;wered her not,
my heart was too full. We embraced, and
lady V&mdash;parted from me in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>I have written to my mother, and directed
my letter to St. James's-&s;treet. I would have
her prepared for the &s;hock before &s;he &s;ees
me; a &s;hock, which I fear &s;he will not be
able to &s;u&s;tain.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 16.&mdash;Mrs. Gerrarde has never
called or &s;ent to me &s;ince I was at her hou&s;e.
She has effected her purpo&s;e, and is content|ed
without a triumph.</P>
<P>I am prepared for my departure. To|morrow
I turn my back upon my hu&s;band's
hou&s;e, and upon my children. I have been
weeping over them this hour as they lie
a&s;leep in their nur&s;e's arms. But I will look
at them no more.&mdash;Poor Patty is almo&s;t
dead with grief; &s;he would fain go with
me, but I have per&s;uaded her to &s;tay: I can
rely on her fidelity and her tenderne&s;s to|wards
my children; &s;he &s;ays, &s;he <HI>will</HI> be as
precious of them as the apple of her eye,
and will give me an account of their wel|fare
<PB N="261" REF="263">
from time to time. Sure Mr. Arnold
will not turn <HI>her</HI> out too; &s;he is an excellent
manager, and he cannot do without a hou&s;e|keeper.</P>
<P>I have been debating with my&s;elf whether
I &s;hould write to Mr. Arnold or not, and
have at length determined to depart in &s;i|lence.
It is an ea&s;y matter for the guilty to
make as bold a&s;&s;everations as the innocent,
and nothing which I could now a&s;&s;ert would
make an impre&s;&s;ion on him. Had I only
his &s;u&s;picions to combat, there might be
hopes: but his <HI>heart</HI> is alienated from me;
and while it continues attached to another,
I de&s;pair of his li&s;tening to the voice of rea|&s;on
or of ju&s;tice. If ever his eyes are open|ed,
his error will prove &s;ufficient puni&s;hment
to him&mdash;Perhaps my mother or my brother
may put me in a way&mdash;My conduct, in time,
I hope, may ju&s;tify me&mdash;Mean while I will
not conde&s;cend to the weak ju&s;tification of
words.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 18.&mdash;I have bid adieu to
South-park, and arrived this morning in
London in a hired carriage, for I would
not take one of Mr. Arnold's. I found my
mother at the hou&s;e in St. James's-&s;treet,
where I now am: &s;he got here la&s;t night, and
my letter had thrown her into agonies, from
which &s;he had not yet recovered. What
have you wrote to me, &s;aid &s;he, as &s;he held
me in her arms? your dreadful letter has al|mo&s;t
<PB N="262" REF="264">
killed me.&mdash;Sure, &s;ure, my dear child,
it cannot be true that you have left your hu&s;|band!
What is the cau&s;e? What have <HI>you</HI>
done? or, What has <HI>he</HI> done? I begged my
mother to compo&s;e her&s;elf a little, and then
related to her every circum&s;tance, in the &s;ame
manner you have had them as they occurred.
Her lamentations pierced my heart; &s;he
wrung her hands in bitterne&s;s of angui&s;h;
Why did not the grave hide me, &s;aid &s;he,
before I &s;aw &s;hame and &s;orrow heaped upon
my child. I came to die in peace with you
&mdash;You might have lengthened my days for
a while&mdash;But you cut them off&mdash;My eyes will
clo&s;e in affliction&mdash;A wounded &s;pirit who
can bear! Had you died in your cradle, we
had both been happy. My child would now
have been a cherub! an angel you have been
in my eyes, and I am puni&s;hed for it; but
that was <HI>my</HI> crime, not your's. But you are
a martyr to the crimes of others.</P>
<P>My mother wept not all this time; I
wi&s;hed &s;he had; her pa&s;&s;ionate looks and
tones affected me more than tears could.
My eyes began to run over, her's &s;oon accom|panied
me, and it a little relieved the vehe|mence
of her grief.</P>
<P>She then began to reproach her&s;elf for
having li&s;tened to lady Grim&s;ton's &s;ugge&s;ti|ons
in favour of Mr. Arnold, and for her
own &s;olliciting this fatal marriage. But I
&s;topped her, on a &s;ubject which I knew would
<PB N="263" REF="265">
&s;o much torment her thoughts. I conjured
her not to reflect on it in that manner; I
told her I knew &s;he had acted for the be&s;t,
and that nothing but an extraordinary fata|lity,
which could neither be fore&s;een nor
avoided, had made me unhappy. I &s;aid I
was &s;ure Mr. Arnold had been &s;educed by
the wiles of a wicked woman, for that he
was by nature a good man, and that he had
more of my pity than of my re&s;entment.</P>
<P>I found it nece&s;&s;ary to reconcile my mo|ther
to her&s;elf on this head; &s;he &s;eemed
willing to lay hold on the hint, and turned
all her indignation again&s;t Mrs. Gerrarde.
A <HI>practi&s;ed</HI> &s;inner, &s;he called her, for whom
nothing could be &s;aid in extenuation of her
crime.</P>
<P>We now turned our thoughts towards
fixing on &s;ome other abode. You may be
&s;ure Mr. Arnold's hou&s;e is no place for us;
and my mother declared &s;he would not &s;tay
another night in it: accordingly we have
di&s;patched her maid to take us lodgings im|mediately.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 21.&mdash;We have quickly &s;hifted
the &s;cene, my dear Cecilia, and are &s;ettled,
at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent, in very hand&s;ome
lodgings in St. Alban's-&s;treet. We came to
them la&s;t night, and my mother &s;eems a
little le&s;s di&s;turbed than &s;he was. I pray
God &s;pare her life, but I fear I &s;hall not long
enjoy that ble&s;&s;ing. She is &s;adly altered
<PB N="264" REF="266">
&s;ince I la&s;t &s;aw her; a drop&s;ical complaint is
&s;tealing on her fa&s;t, her legs are &s;welled,
and &s;he has intirely lo&s;t her appetite; yet if
her mind were a little more at ea&s;e, I &s;hould
hope, that by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;he can have
here, &s;he might be enabled to hold out a|gain&s;t
this di&s;order for a good while. I en|deavour
to &s;uppre&s;s my own grief, that I may
not increa&s;e her's.</P>
<P>I was &s;urprized to-day by a vi&s;itor to my
mother. Mi&s;s Burchell came to pay her re|&s;pects
to her: I have told you they corre&s;|ponded.
My mother, it &s;eems, had given
her notice of the time &s;he intended being
in town: the young lady had been to wait
on her in St James's-&s;treet, and was from
thence directed by the &s;ervant, who kept
the hou&s;e, to our new lodgings.</P>
<P>She is really a very lovely young woman;
and there is &s;omething &s;o in&s;inuating in her
manner, that there is no &s;eeing her without
being prejudiced in her favour. She changed
colour when my mother pre&s;ented me to
her by my name; but, at the &s;ame time,
&s;urveyed me with a &s;crutinous eye. My
mother a&s;ked her, had &s;he &s;een Mr. Faulk|land
&s;ince his return to England. She an|&s;wered,
No, with a &s;igh; but that &s;he be|lieved
he had been at Putney. To &s;ee his
&s;on, &s;aid my mother? without reflecting,
that Mi&s;s Burchell had avoided mentioning
that circum&s;tance, and &s;topped upon name|ing
<PB N="265" REF="267">
the place where the child was at nur&s;e.
Yes, &s;he replied, in a timorous accent, and
&s;tealing a look at me. The woman told
me, that a young gentleman had been there
about &s;ix weeks ago, who &s;aid he came
from the child's father abroad, and made
her a hand&s;ome pre&s;ent. As I did not then
know Mr. Faulkland was returned to Eng|land,
I &s;hould not have &s;u&s;pected it was he
him&s;elf who had called, if his hou&s;ekeeper
(that gentlewoman in who&s;e care he left me)
had not come to me from him. She is
&s;ettled now in a lodging-hou&s;e; and Mr.
Faulkland, on his coming to London, went
to her, to enquire where the child was.
She told me he enquired civilly after me,
and gave her a letter for me, which the
good-natured woman joyfully brought me;
but it contained nothing but a bill of a hun|dred
pounds, with two or three lines, po|lite
indeed, but not kind, to inform me it
was for the child's u&s;e; and I have heard
nothing of him &s;ince.</P>
<P>My mother told her, that as Mr. Faulk|land
was returned again, probably to con|tinue
in England, &s;he did not de&s;pair of
his being brought to do her ju&s;tice: e&s;pe|cially
as &s;he mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e the &s;ight of the
child had made an impre&s;&s;ion on him. She
then, without ceremony, entered into a
detail of my unhappy &s;tory: &s;he was full of
it; and being, as you know, of a very
<PB N="266" REF="268">
communicative temper, made no &s;cruple to
inform Mi&s;s Burchell of every particular.
She &s;eemed very much affected with the
&s;tory, and grew red and pale by turns; e&s;|pecially
at finding her aunt &s;o deeply con|cerned
in it. She exclaimed again&s;t her
barbarity, reproached Mr. Arnold for his
injurious &s;u&s;picions, and condoled obliging|ly
with me on the wrongs I had received;
and yet, my Cecilia, would you believe it,
I thought I could di&s;cover, through all
this, that Mi&s;s Burchell was not entirely free
from doubt in regard to my innocence.
This ob&s;ervation I gathered only from cer|tain
looks that &s;he ca&s;t at me, as my mo|ther
related the pa&s;&s;ages. There are little
minute touches on the countenance &s;ome|times,
which are &s;o tran&s;ient they can hardly
be overtaken by the eye, and which, from
the pa&s;&s;ions being &s;trongly guarded that
give ri&s;e to the&s;e emotions, are &s;o &s;light,
that a common ob&s;erver cannot di&s;cover
them at all. I am &s;ure my mother did not;
but my &s;en&s;ibility was particularly rouzed at
her relating a &s;tory that I did not then wi&s;h
to have divulged; and I was too much in|tere&s;ted
in the narrative, not to attend pre|ci&s;ely
to its effects on the hearer. I am
neither angry with, nor &s;urprized at Mi&s;s
Burchell, for her &s;ceptici&s;m on this occa&s;ion.
She loves Mr. Faulkland, and had not
her&s;elf the power to re&s;i&s;t him: &s;he knows
<PB N="267" REF="269">
he once loved me, and may fancy he does &s;o
&s;till; nay, thinks perhaps I am not indiffer|ent
towards him: &s;he is a &s;tranger to <HI>my</HI>
heart; but is convinced, that her aunt is
ba&s;e enough, fir&s;t to en&s;nare to vice, and
then to betray. Upon the whole, there is
nothing unnatural in her &s;u&s;picions; but I
think they could not proceed from a vir|tuous
mind.</P>
<P>Upon Mi&s;s Burchell's taking leave, my
mother gave her a general invitation to
come to her as often as &s;he had lei&s;ure;
telling her, &s;he mu&s;t not take it ami&s;s if
&s;he did not return her vi&s;its, as her health
would not permit her to go much abroad.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Burchell, it &s;eems, has a hou&s;e (not
lodgings) in a retired &s;treet in We&s;tmin&s;ter,
where &s;he has been ever &s;ince &s;he quitted
her aunt, to whom &s;he never di&s;covered
where &s;he lived. Her fortune enables her
to appear very genteelly in the private man|ner
&s;he chu&s;es to live. She goes but &s;el|dom
into publick, and has but a narrow cir|cle
of acquaintance. Tho&s;e are all of her
own &s;ex, and of the be&s;t character; and
&s;he has had the good fortune to pre&s;erve
her reputation un&s;u&s;pected; &s;o that, I hope,
&s;he may yet retrieve her error by an advan|tageous
match, &s;hould Mr. Faulkland &s;till
continue aver&s;e to her.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 28.&mdash;I have had a letter
from Patty: &s;he tells me, her ma&s;ter is re|turned
<PB N="268" REF="270">
home; and adds, &startq;To be &s;ure,
that vile wicked wretch let him know you
were gone.&endq; She &s;ays, he called for the
two dear babes, and ki&s;&s;ed them both. Pat|ty
carried the younge&s;t to him in her arms,
the other in her hand, and &s;he &s;ays, he
looked troubled. How came you not to
follow your lady, Mrs. Martha, &s;aid he?
She replied, My lady was willing, Sir, that
I &s;hould &s;tay to look after the children&mdash;
And to be a &s;py upon my actions, I &s;up|po&s;e:
Is not that to be part of your employ|ment
too? Ah! Patty, Patty; Mrs. Arnold
had better have looked to her own conduct.
Patty made no an&s;wer, but retired in tears.
Every one in the hou&s;e, &s;he writes, is bro|ken-hearted;
but that Mr. Arnold is never
at home, &s;pending his whole time with
Mrs. Gerrarde, whom the girl, in the over|flowings
of her zeal for me, heartily exe|crates.
She informed him, that I was gone
to London, and purpo&s;ed living with my
mother, who was now there.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 7.&mdash;I have ju&s;t received a let|ter
from Lady V&mdash;. She tells me &s;he &s;ent
twice to invite Mr. Arnold to dine with
them, in order, if po&s;&s;ible, to lead him
into a conver&s;ation, by which they hoped,
in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to have cleared my inno|cence,
as my lord could take upon him to
ju&s;tify Mr. Faulkland; but he declined
coming, not knowing, perhaps, that Mr.
<PB N="269" REF="271">
Faulkland was ab&s;ent from V&mdash;hall. She
&s;aid, her lord had gone to South-Park;
but either Mr. Arnold was not at home, or
denied, him&s;elf. My lady adds, &startq;It is a
delicate affair to interpo&s;e in; yet would
I have ventured to have wrote to your
hu&s;band, if I had been &s;ure that you had
no objection to my telling him, that you
had made me privy to the cau&s;e of your
parting: 'tis plain, by his avoiding us,
it is a &s;ubject he does not care to come to
an explanation upon. Let me have your
&s;entiments, and I will act accordingly.&endq;</P>
<P>I &s;hall an&s;wer Lady V&mdash;'s letter directly,
and beg of her to leave the matter as it is.
Mrs. Gerrarde's te&s;timony will have more
weight than all my good lord or lady could
urge in my favour: be&s;ides, they are not
furni&s;hed with &s;ufficient weapons to combat
again&s;t &s;uch an enemy: they know nothing
of Mi&s;s Burchell's &s;tory; my regard to <HI>her</HI>
character prevented me from giving my la|dy
this &s;pecimen of her aunt's ba&s;ene&s;s. I
&s;uppo&s;e the &s;ame rea&s;on may have clo&s;ed
Mr. Faulkland's lips on that &s;ubject: &s;o
that they have nothing to alledge again&s;t
Mrs. Gerrarde, which would help to inva|lidate
her te&s;timony with regard to Mr.
Faulkland and me. Mr. Arnold, indeed,
knows that &s;he has forfeited her preten&s;ions
to mode&s;ty; but the delu&s;ion of &s;elf-love
blinds a man in tho&s;e ca&s;es; and he can be|lieve,
<PB N="270" REF="272">
that <HI>truth, &s;incerity,</HI> and <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> in|habit
the bo&s;om of her, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>him</HI>
alone has cau&s;ed a deviation from cha&s;tity.</P>
<P>I cannot think of expo&s;ing the poor Mi&s;s
Burchell by giving up her &s;ecret. Though
it might contribute to clear me, by turning
Mr. Arnold's &s;u&s;picions on Mrs. Gerrarde,
yet would &s;he have great rea&s;on to re&s;ent it;
more e&s;pecially as &s;he is now, by a blame|le&s;s
life, endeavouring to blot out the me|mory
of her fault. Though my Lady V&mdash;
is very prudent, her zeal for me, and my
lord's good-natured earne&s;tne&s;s in my cau&s;e,
might render them unguarded on the occa|&s;ion;
and &s;hould they attempt to make u&s;e
of this &s;ecret, in order to criminate Mrs.
Gerrarde, it might, at the &s;ame time, bring
malicious cen&s;ures both on Mi&s;s Burchell
and Mr. Faulkland.</P>
<P>I think, upon the whole, my mother is
the propere&s;t per&s;on to mediate on this nice
occa&s;ion. When Mr. Arnold comes to
town, &s;he can, with due tenderne&s;s to the
yo$ng lady, di&s;clo&s;e the whole affair to him.
The knowledge of this black part of Mrs.
Gerrarde's character, joined to her argu|ments,
may perhaps have &s;ome weight;
though, to tell you the &s;ecret bodings of my
heart, I expect not much from this. I have
lo&s;t my hu&s;band's love; Mrs. Gerrarde po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es
it all; and who knows whether he even
wi&s;hes to lo&s;e his pretence for abandoning an
unhappy wife? I wi&s;h however, Mr. Faulk|land
<PB N="271" REF="273">
were returned to V&mdash;hall: &s;hould Mr.
Arnold know of his ab&s;ence at this juncture,
he might imagine po&s;&s;ibly he was gone in
que&s;t of me.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 12.&mdash;How the &s;cene is chang|ed,
my &s;i&s;ter! What a melancholy rever&s;e
is here, to my late pro&s;pect of dome&s;tic
happine&s;s! I pa&s;s my nights in tears, and
bitter reflections on my di&s;mal &s;ituation.
My days are &s;pent in a painful con&s;traint,
to conceal the angui&s;h of my own heart,
that I may not aggravate that of my
poor mother. My endeavours to be chear|ful,
I perceive, have a good effect on her:
&s;he is much more compo&s;ed, and &s;eems re|&s;igned
to our fate, patiently waiting for a
change. I think too &s;he is rather better in
her health; &s;he has had the advice of a
phy&s;ician of eminent &s;kill; the medicines
pre&s;cribed, he gives us hopes, will keep
her di&s;order at lea&s;t from gaining ground;
and that &s;he may hold out for &s;ome years.</P>
<P>I have prevailed on her not to give Sir
George an account of my unhappy &s;tory,
'till I hear that Mr. Faulkland has left him;
becau&s;e I know my brother would conceal
nothing from him; and, if po&s;&s;ible, I
would have Mr. Arnold's &s;u&s;picions of <HI>Him</HI>
concealed. I have many rea&s;ons for this;
my own delicacy would receive a wound by
it; for who knows what judgement Mr.
Faulkland might form on this knowledge?
But my mo&s;t material objection is, &s;hould
<PB N="272" REF="274">
he attempt to vindicate his own honour,
what might be the con&s;equence! I &s;hudder
to think of it. I know Mr. Faulkland is
ra&s;h, when provoked. Rather let my &s;uf|ferings
and my di&s;grace lie wrapped in ob|livion,
than bring any di&s;a&s;ter on the father
of my children.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 16.&mdash;Another letter from
Lady V&mdash;. She tells me, that Mr. Faulk|land
is returned from his vi&s;it to my brother.
He was &s;oon informed of my parting with
Mr. Arnold; it is the talk of the neighbour|hood;
every body lays it on Mrs. Gerrarde.
Mr. Faulkland was very inqui&s;itive to learn
particulars from my lady, which, he &s;aid,
he was &s;ure I had told her; but &s;he took
care not to give him the lea&s;t hint which
could lead him to &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>He</HI> had any
&s;hare in my fate. She &s;ays, he raves like a
madman; and that &s;he finds it ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary to keep him in ignorance of the
truth. She was obliged to tell him, that
my having di&s;covered Mr. Arnold's amour
with Mrs. Gerrarde, &s;he believed, was the
&s;ole cau&s;e of our &s;eparation. He a&s;ked
her, Was &s;he <HI>&s;ure</HI> there was no other?
adding, That he thought my temper had
been too gentle, to fly, on a &s;udden, to
&s;uch extremes. My lady took occa&s;ion to
a&s;k him, Whether he did not vi&s;it Mrs.
Gerrarde? He replied, He did &s;ometimes,
having formerly known her at Bath. She
<PB N="273" REF="275">
concludes with telling me, That Mr. Ar|nold
is become quite invi&s;ible to every friend
he has, Mrs. Gerrarde engro&s;&s;ing him wholly.</P>
<P>I hope Mr. Faulkland may not &s;u&s;pect
how much <HI>He</HI> is concerned in my misfor|tune:
my ab&s;enting my&s;elf, for &s;ome time
before I left home, from V&mdash;hall, and my
departure from my hu&s;band, immediately
after my interview with Mr. Faulk|land
at Mrs. Gerrarde's, may rai&s;e &s;ome
di&s;tru&s;t in his mind; but, while it conti|tinues
merely &s;urmi&s;e, he can have no pre|tence
for requiring an explanation from Mr.
Arnold; &s;o that, if my hu&s;band keeps his
own council, which he &s;eems inclined to do,
and my lord and lady V&mdash;pre&s;erve the &s;e|cret,
I &s;hall re&s;t &s;atisfied.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 20.&mdash;My mother has wrote
to Sir George, and given him a full account
of my &s;ituation, with a reque&s;t, which I
prevailed on her to make, that he would
not take any notice of the affair 'till he &s;aw
us. My brother, perhaps, may think of a
way, with tenderne&s;s and &s;afety, to remove
Mr. Arnold's doubts, without farther ex|po&s;ing
my reputation, or laying my hu&s;|band
open to mi&s;chief. A prudent, cool,
and at the &s;ame time zealous friend, might
devi&s;e &s;ome means to effect this; but I fear
my brother's di&s;regard to Mr. Arnold, his
dimini&s;hed love for me, and his re&s;entment
to my mother, will prevent him from en|gaging
<PB N="274" REF="276">
with that alacrity or precaution that
the nicety of circum&s;tances may require. I
will, therefore, wait with patience, 'till
God, in his own time, &s;hall rai&s;e me from
the &s;tate of humiliation into which I am
fallen.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 22.&mdash;With what a tortoi&s;e
pace does time advance to the wretched!
how di&s;mal are tho&s;e hours which are &s;pent
in reflecting on lo&s;t happine&s;s. O Faulk|land!
how light was thy tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, if
we con&s;ider the con&s;equences, compared to
that which has driven me from my home,
and from my children! &s;teeled my hu&s;band's
heart again&s;t me, heaped infamy on <HI>my</HI>
head, and loaded my mother's age with &s;or|row
and remor&s;e! All this is the fatal con|&s;equence
of Mr. Arnold's breach of his
marriage-vow: all this, and much more,
I fear, that is to come.</P>
<P>We keep our&s;elves entirely concealed from
the knowledge of our old acquaintance:
not a mortal vi&s;its us, but, now-and-then,
Mi&s;s Burchell; and I have never &s;tirred out
of doors but to church.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 28.&mdash;Sir George has an&s;wered
my mother's letter, ju&s;t as I feared he would:
he &s;peaks of Mr. Arnold with more con|tempt
and aver&s;ion, than he does of me
with pity or brotherly kindne&s;s. He &s;ays,
&startq;It is well for him, that Mr. Faulkland
knows not of his injurious &s;u&s;picion of
<PB N="275" REF="277">
him, or he would vindicate him&s;elf in a
manner he little thinks of.&endq; He tells us,
He does not know (at this di&s;tance) how to
advi&s;e; but that, as I am of &s;o <HI>patient</HI> and
<HI>forbearing</HI> a &s;pirit, he thinks my wrongs
may &s;leep 'till he comes to town, which
cannot yet be the&s;e three or four weeks,
having lea&s;es to renew with his tenants, and
abundance of other bu&s;ine&s;s to do in the
country.&mdash;So much for George's tender|ne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 29.&mdash;My comforts are cir|cum&s;cribed
within a very narrow compa&s;s;
for I cannot reckon one, but what I receive
from poor Patty's letters, who never fails to
&s;end me weekly an account of my dear lit|tle
children. They are all well, thank God,
and not yet abandoned by their father; but
even the knowledge of this is imbittered by
repeated hints of Mr. Arnold's lo&s;t condi|tion.
Lo&s;t, I may call it; for his whole
&s;oul is ab&s;orbed in the mad pur&s;uit of his
own ruin. The poor girl, in the bitterne&s;s
of her indignation, tells me he has made
Mrs. Gerrarde a pre&s;ent of a favourite little
pad of mine: &s;he &s;ays, &s;he had a mind to
tear her off, when &s;he &s;aw her mounted up|on
it.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h not to be told of any of Mr. Ar|nold's
motions, and &s;hould forbid Patty to
write to me any thing on the &s;ubject, but
that I fear my letter might fall into Mr.
<PB N="276" REF="278">
Arnold's hands: his curio&s;ity might lead
him to open it (for the con&s;cious mind will
de&s;cend to meanne&s;&s;es); and, if he &s;hould
&s;ee my prohibition, he would be &s;atisfied
that his &s;ervant was too free in her cen&s;ures.
I am &s;ure he is quite unconcerned at <HI>my</HI>
knowing his conduct; but I would not ne|verthele&s;s,
for my children's &s;ake, bring
this tender, faithful poor creature into di&s;|grace
with him, by convincing him of the
liberty &s;he takes, though he may very na|turally
&s;u&s;pect it.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 30.&mdash;A lady of our acquaint|ance,
who happened to &s;ee me at church,
came to pay me a vi&s;it to-day. It &s;eems,
&s;he is intimate with the widow Arnold, who
told her, very lately, that &s;he was impati|ent
for the commencement of term, as &s;he
then expected the cau&s;e depending between
her and us would be brought to a final i&s;&s;ue,
and determined entirely in her child's fa|vour.
This account alarmed my poor
mother &s;o much, that &s;he could not be ea&s;y
'till &s;he &s;ent for our lawyer, who was &s;o
obliging as to come upon the fir&s;t &s;ummons.
She acquainted him with the cau&s;e of her
apprehen&s;ions; and a&s;ked him whether
there was any likelyhood of the widow's
&s;ucceeding. He laughed at my mother's
fears, and at our antagoni&s;t's flouri&s;hes, as
he called them; and &s;aid, he would not
give a bent &s;ix-pence to en&s;ure Mr. Arnold's
<PB N="277" REF="279">
e&s;tate to him, which the en&s;uing term, he
&s;ays, will put out of the reach of doubt.
This a&s;&s;urance has quieted our anxiety on
that head. The lo&s;s of our &s;uit would in|deed
be a dreadful blow, as we &s;hould have
nothing then remaining but my &s;mall join|ture,
for the &s;upport of Mr. Arnold, my|&s;elf,
and our two children; not to mention
Mrs. Gerrarde, who, I have rea&s;on to be|lieve,
has been no incon&s;iderable &s;harer in
Mr. Arnold's fortune.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 4.&mdash;Six melancholy weeks
are gone &s;ince I have been here, I may &s;ay,
both a pri&s;oner, and a fugitive. I count the
days as they pa&s;s, as if I expected &s;ome re|volution
in my fate; yet, whence is it to
come? No pro&s;pect as yet opens to me.
Mr. Arnold's law-affairs will &s;oon call him
to town: &s;omething may then happen&mdash;But
does not Mrs. Gerrarde come too? He
cannot live without her; and I &s;hall reap no
benefit from this, but the chance of &s;eeing
my children &s;ometimes perhaps; though he
may not bring them with him, or, if he
does, he may be cruel enough to refu&s;e me
the &s;ight of them. Sir George is cold and
dilatory: were he on the &s;pot, &s;omething
might be done; he might expo&s;tulate: my
mother too could join arguments to intrea|ties:
Mr. Arnold perhaps might be recover|ed
from his delu&s;ion; it is but a per|haps.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="280">
<HI>November</HI> 15.&mdash;My brother is arrived in
town &s;ooner than we expected, and came
this evening to pay us a vi&s;it. My altered
and dejected looks, I believe, &s;hocked him;
but George wants tenderne&s;s, or at lea&s;t a
capacity of &s;hewing it. After a recapitula|tion
of my &s;tory, he a&s;ked me, &startq;Could I
be &s;o mean-&s;pirited a creature as ever to
think of living with Arnold again, even
though he &s;hould be inclined to de&s;ire it?&endq;
I told him, he con&s;idered the matter in a
wrong light; and that he ought to reflect on
my reputation, and the future welfare of my
two poor little girls, who would be material
&s;ufferers, from the want of my care and at|tention,
as they grew up; not to mention
the di&s;advantages they would enter into life
with, by my continuing under an a&s;per&s;ion
which might in time become very public,
and perhaps be believed too, as I made no
doubt but that Mrs. Gerrarde would take
pains to propagate it wherever &s;he went.
My mother added, Mr. Arnold too might
be &s;aved from perdition, if he could be &s;o
far convinced of his wife's innocence, as to
be reconciled to her, and live with her a|gain.
And pray, &s;aid Sir George, how is
this to be done, if that damned woman
has put it into his head, that Faulkland and
you are fond of one another? Do you ima|gine
that he will believe what <HI>you</HI> &s;ay?
what your brother, or your mother, or even
<PB N="279" REF="281">
Faulkland him&s;elf, could &s;ay to the contrary?
I own to you very fairly, that I &s;o much de|&s;pi&s;e
the man, that, unle&s;s you will give me
leave to talk to him my own way, I will have
nothing to &s;ay to him at all. Would you
have me <HI>&s;ue</HI> to him for a reconciliation, and
try to per&s;uade him out of the belief of an
imaginary injury, which probably he was glad
to make a handle of to get rid of you? No,
Sidney; you may be as tame as you plea&s;e
your&s;elf, but it does not become your bro|ther
to be &s;o. When I go to him, I mu&s;t
in&s;i&s;t upon not having rules pre&s;cribed to me:
your delicacy, in regard to Faulkland's a&s;|&s;erting
your innocence, I have nothing to &s;ay
again&s;t; but there can be no objection to
your brother's vindicating the honour of his
family. I &s;aw Sir George's re&s;entment was
rou&s;ed to the highe&s;t pitch; his eyes &s;park|led
with indignation, and his whole frame
&s;eemed agitated.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>Dear brother,</OPENER>
<P>&s;aid I, I conjure you, (and
I fell upon my knees and cla&s;ped both my
arms round his) do not add to my affliction,
by involving your&s;elf and my hu&s;band in a
fatal quarrel. What difference would it
make to me if Mr. Arnold &s;hould fall, whe|ther
it is by your hand, or Mr. Faulkland's?
The lo&s;s would be the &s;ame; the misfortune,
the publication of my di&s;grace, the &s;ame.
Your hu&s;band, &s;aid he, breaking from me,
though a little &s;oftened, would have as good
<PB N="280" REF="282">
a chance as I, if it came to the hazard; or
perhaps he might conde&s;cend to take you
again (if you will have it &s;o,) without coming
to the&s;e extremities, if I am &s;uffered to ar|gue
properly with him&mdash;I will not con&s;ent
to your &s;eeing him at all, &s;aid I, eagerly.
The cau&s;e is now my own, he an&s;wered,
coolly; but I will do nothing to aggravate
your di&s;tre&s;s. I did not like the manner in
which he &s;poke. My mother, who 'till now
had been &s;ilent, caught the alarm. Let me in|treat
you, &s;on, &s;aid &s;he, to drop the thoughts
of any violent methods with Mr. Arnold.
If you value your &s;i&s;ter's peace, or have
any regard to the obedience you owe me, I
in&s;i&s;t on it, that you neither &s;ee him nor write
to him, without our knowledge and con&s;ent;
and if you do not promi&s;e me this, I re|nounce
all ties of kindred or affection to you:
your mother has as ju&s;t a &s;en&s;e of the ho|nour
of her family as you can have; but it
is not on &s;o hot a head, and &s;o weak an arm,
that &s;he depends to &s;ee it ju&s;tified to the
world. Sir George, who was nettled at my
mother's &s;pirited rebuke, made her a low
bow. No doubt of it, madam, &s;aid he,
there will be a miracle wrought in my &s;i&s;ter's
favour. I would have you let her try the
experiment of the ordeal: I dare &s;ay &s;he
would come off victorious, and then Mr.
Arnold will do you the favour to take her
home again. I wi&s;h, &s;aid my mother, gravely,
<PB N="281" REF="283">
that there was a po&s;&s;ibility of bringing my
dear child's innocence to &s;uch a proof; I
would not he&s;itate a minute to put it to the
trial: but &s;ince there is no &s;uch a thing <HI>now-a-days,</HI>
I will wait 'till God, in his own
righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;hall judge her cau&s;e, and
clear her to the world. Therefore, &s;on, I
in&s;i&s;t upon your promi&s;e before you leave
me.</P>
<P>I give you my word, madam, an&s;wered
Sir George, I will not attempt to hold any
conference with Mr. Arnold without your
knowledge. Will that &s;atisfy you? It does,
an&s;wered my mother; for I think I can rely
upon your word. Sir George left us not
very well &s;atisfied with each other; his pride
and re&s;entment piqued to the highe&s;t. I
cannot cen&s;ure him for it here: he has cau&s;e;
but the ca&s;e is a nice and difficult one. The
gratification of a private &s;pleen ought not to
enter into the mea&s;ures he &s;hould pur&s;ue.
Glad I am that my mother's properly-exerted
re&s;olution has tamed him a little. Though
George &s;ometimes fails in the re&s;pect which
he owes her, yet I never knew him wilfully
to di&s;obey her commands, or oppo&s;e her
inclinations. 'Tis well there is any hold on
a di&s;po&s;ition &s;o ungentle and &s;elf-willed as
his.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 18.&mdash;My brother has taken a
very hand&s;ome hou&s;e in Pall-mall, and told
my mother, between je&s;t and earne&s;t, he is
<PB N="282" REF="284">
going to give her a daughter-in-law, to make
up for the lo&s;s of her &s;on-in-law. He is, in
reality, making his addre&s;&s;es to lady Sarah
P. the daughter of a new-created peer. She
has a great fortune, he tells me; but I know
nothing more of her. I wi&s;h him better
&s;ucce&s;s in his nuptials (if they take place)
than I have had.</P>
<P><HI>Nov.</HI> 20.&mdash;Mr. Arnold is arrived in
town: he came late la&s;t night, and his man
called this morning to enquire how I did.
The poor fellow &s;tole out before his ma&s;ter
was up; and was afraid of &s;taying a minute,
le&s;t he &s;hould be wanted at home. I called
him up to the dining-room: I &s;aw an hone&s;t
&s;hame and &s;orrow in his countenance. How
does your ma&s;ter do, Frank, &s;aid I? Has
he brought the children to town? No, ma|dam,
&s;aid he; but they are pure and hearty.
I believe my ma&s;ter thought it a pity to bring
them out of the fre&s;h air, as long as Mrs.
Patty is there to look after them. They are
better where they are. I a&s;ked him was Mr.
Arnold come to town to make any &s;tay? I
believe for good-and-all, &s;aid he. This
ugly law-&s;uit, to be &s;ure, will detain him;
but he is come <HI>alone,</HI> &s;aid he, with an intel|ligent
nod: I don't &s;uppo&s;e though he will
continue long &s;o. Well, Frank, &s;aid I, I
am glad to hear your ma&s;ter and the child|ren
are well. Ah, madam! &s;haking his
<PB N="283" REF="285">
head as he opened the door to go out, it was
a woeful day for us when you left South
Park. God give every one their reward!</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 22.&mdash;I have not &s;een my bro|ther
the&s;e two days: he does not know, I
believe, that Mr. Arnold is come to town;
though, if he did, I am &s;ure he will not
break his word; &s;o that I am ea&s;y on that
particular. My mother &s;ays &s;he will go to
Mr. Arnold her&s;elf, to <HI>rea&s;on</HI> with him a
little. I &s;hall not oppo&s;e it, though I have
no hopes of her being able to effect any thing
in my favour: &s;he is now laid up with a
cold, and is not able to come out of her
room; but &s;he plea&s;es her&s;elf with the
thoughts of this vi&s;it, as &s;oon as &s;he is able
to make it. She has planned what &s;he in|tends
to &s;ay to him; and is re&s;olved to let
him into the whole hi&s;tory of Mi&s;s Burchell,
that he may know, &s;he &s;ays, the full extent
of Mrs. Gerrarde's wickedne&s;s; as what is
there of which that woman is not capable,
who could &s;et to &s;ale the honour of an in|nocent,
un&s;u&s;pecting creature, left to her
guardian&s;hip?</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 23.&mdash;Amazing, my dear
Cecilia! I thought I &s;hould wonder no more
at any thing, yet is my wonder now rai&s;ed
to a&s;toni&s;hment&mdash;I have ju&s;t received a let|ter
from lady V&mdash;. I have read it over and
over again, and yet &s;carce can believe my
&s;en&s;es. Here it is in her own words.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="286">
&startq;I &s;uppo&s;e you know, my dear Mrs. Ar|nold,
that your hu&s;band is in town; and
that he left Mrs Gerrarde behind him for
no other rea&s;on, I imagine, but that he
did not chu&s;e to be quite &s;o &s;candalous as
to let her travel with him; for we heard
that &s;he purpo&s;ed following him in a few
days. Patty, I conclude, may have in|formed
you of thus much; but the extra|ordinary
part of the intelligence, I believe,
is re&s;erved for me to acquaint you with.
Know then that Mrs. Gerrarde is eloped,
no-body knows whither. <HI>Good,</HI> &s;ay you;
good, &s;hould <HI>I</HI> &s;ay too; but for the con|clu&s;ion
of my &s;tory. It is with Mr. <HI>Faulk|land</HI>
&s;he is eloped: 'tis po&s;itively true;
&s;he went off with him in triumph la&s;t
night in her own chariot, and neither of
them have been heard of &s;ince. I own I
am &s;o much confounded at this, I &s;carce
know what I write.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am very glad, for your &s;ake, that bad
creature has quitted your hu&s;band; but
that &s;he &s;hould have drawn my cou&s;in
Faulkland in, is matter of &s;erious concern
to me. It is evident the plan was previ|ou&s;ly
concerted between them; for I am
informed to-day, that Mrs. Gerrarde's
maid decamped at the &s;ame time, and
took with her every thing valuable belong|ing
to her mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;everal of her drawers
being found open and empty. Mr. Faulk|land's
<PB N="285" REF="287">
&s;ervants have al&s;o di&s;appeared; &s;o
that we cannot conjecture which way they
are gone.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mr. Faulkland, who was about leaving
us, a&s;ked my permi&s;&s;ion to give a ball to
the neighbouring ladies in our new room,
which is ju&s;t fini&s;hed. As I concluded he
would a&s;k no-body but our own acquaint|ance,
I readily con&s;ented; and my lord,

I was &s;urprized to &s;ee Mrs. Gerrarde
among&s;t the company, as undaunted as
the <HI>mode&s;te&s;t</HI> face there. I would not how|ever
affront Mr. Faulkland &s;o much, as
to &s;hew any di&s;repect to one, who was, at
that time, <HI>his</HI> gue&s;t; but I was out of all
patience to find that <HI>&s;he,</HI> along with &s;everal
others, was a&s;ked to &s;upper; my too-good-natured
lord joining in the invitation.
Mr. Faulkland made a pretence to wait on
her home, and the audacious creature took
that opportunity to march off with him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Now, as Faulkland really purpo&s;ed
leaving V&mdash;hall the next day, I think it
would have been but decent in him to have
forebore this piece of barefaced libertini&s;m,
'till he was fairly from under <HI>our</HI> roof. He
have made his a&s;&s;ignation in any other
place; but, I &s;uppo&s;e, the lady had a mind
to &s;hew the world &s;he is above re&s;traint,
and cho&s;e to make her infamy a &s;ort of
triumph.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="288">
&startq;sI am quite angry with my lord, for only
laughing at this, and calling it a piece of
&s;pirited gallantry in them both. He &s;ays, he
is delighted to think how your good man
will &s;hake his ears, when he hears his mi|&s;tre&s;s
has left him in the lurch and gone off
with another lover. I &s;hould &s;mile too; but
that it makes me &s;ad to think, that Mr.
Faulkland, of whom I had &s;o good an opini|on,
&s;hould &s;o impo&s;e upon my judgement,
and forfeit his own character, for &s;o vile a

<P>&startq;Pardon me, my dear madam; I am &s;o

</LETTER>
<P>Well, my Cecilia, what &s;ay you to this?
Are you not as much &s;urprized as I am? Mr.
Faulkland to emerge at la&s;t the favourite
gallant of Mrs. Gerrarde! Prodigious! I
confe&s;s, my dear, I am &s;o &s;elfi&s;h as not to
<PB N="287" REF="289">
participate with lady V&mdash;in her unea|&s;ine&s;s
on this occa&s;ion. That Mrs. Gerrarde
flies from my hu&s;band, I am glad; and that
Mr. <HI>Faulkland</HI> is the very man &s;he cho&s;e to fly
with, I am &s;till gladder: he, of all men
living, I would have wi&s;hed (though lea&s;t
expected) to be the per&s;on. This explains
every thing that is pa&s;&s;ed. Surely as lady
V&mdash;&s;ays, this <HI>mu&s;t</HI> open Mr. Arnold's
eyes. I can now di&s;cover a double rea&s;on
for my poor deluded man's having his ima|gination
poi&s;oned with jealou&s;y. Mrs. Ger|rarde
did not aim &s;ingly at &s;eparating my
hu&s;band and me: this, perhaps, was but a
&s;econdary con&s;ideration; or who knows
whether it was at all intended? But &s;he mo&s;t
certainly de&s;igned to &s;ecure her&s;elf again&s;t all
&s;u&s;picions, by making me the object of them;
and effectually to blind Mr. Arnold, per|&s;uaded
him, that Mr. Faulkland's vi&s;its,
made to her, were only in the hope of &s;eeing
me.</P>
<P>Let her views have been what they would,
this event was beyond my hopes. Some
glimmerings of comfort begin to break in
upon me. Methinks my heart feels much
lighter than it did. How Sir George will
&s;tare at this account! My mother will lift up
her eyes; but &s;he has no opinion of Mr.
Faulkland's morals, and therefore will be
le&s;s &s;urprized. I pity Mi&s;s Burchell: this is
an irremediable bar to our hopes; faint and
<PB N="288" REF="290">
un&s;upported as they were made before, they
mu&s;t now entirely vani&s;h.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 24.&mdash;I gave you a copy of
lady V&mdash;'s letter, while the &s;ubject was
warm at my heart, and before I &s;hewed it to
any one; but my mother and my brother
have now both &s;een it. My mother (ju&s;t as
I expected,) without any great emotions of
&s;urprize, only exclaimed again&s;t their wick|edne&s;s;
but &s;aid, &s;he could not help rejoicing
in it, as <HI>I,</HI> &s;he hoped, would derive happi|ne&s;s
from their accumulated crimes. Sir
George read the letter twice over before he
uttered a word; and then &s;aid, It was <HI>&s;trange;</HI>
upon his &s;oul, mo&s;t unaccountable; and that
either Faulkland was run mad, or that wo|man
had bewitched him. When he was
with me at Sidney-Ca&s;tle, he did not, &s;aid he,
&s;o much as mention her. I a&s;ked him, whe|ther
he was acquainted with Mr. Arnold (for
I had written him word of your marriage,
when he was abroad?) He told me, he had
&s;een both you and him two or three times, at
lord V&mdash;'s; but that, as he did not wi&s;h to
renew his acquaintance with you, he had ne|ver
vi&s;ited your hu&s;band. I pre&s;ume he
was not then a &s;tranger to his connection
with Mrs. Gerrarde; at lea&s;t to the conjec|tures
of the neighbourhood upon it: but as
it was then but a matter of opinion, and he
knew not of the difference between you and
your hu&s;band, 'tis probable he did not chu&s;e
<PB N="289" REF="291">
to di&s;gu&s;t me more again&s;t my brother-in-law,
by hinting at this circum&s;tance. He
expre&s;&s;ed great acknowledgements to my
mother, when I told him of the notice &s;he
had taken of Mi&s;s Burchell; though, he
&s;aid, he found (from my account of your
marriage) that &s;he had deferred her confer|ence
with that young lady, 'till it was too
late for her te&s;timony to be of any &s;ervice
to him. As I knew nothing of what had
pa&s;&s;ed between my mother and Mi&s;s Burchell,
I could give him no &s;atisfaction on that &s;ub|ject;
and the recollection of pa&s;t tran&s;actions
being equally di&s;agreeable to us both, I
avoided ever mentioning them after our fir&s;t
conver&s;ation; nor do I remember that Mrs.
Gerrarde's name occurred once.</P>
<P>My mother now began to exult over Sir
George, and took advantage of the &s;urprize
and con&s;ternation that Lady V&mdash;'s letter had
thrown him into. This is your boa&s;ted
friend, &s;aid &s;he,; the man who&s;e <HI>honour</HI> and
<HI>genero&s;ity</HI> were not to be que&s;tioned, and
who&s;e <HI>utmo&s;t</HI> crime was a youthful folly that
he was &s;urprized into with a &s;illy girl. I am
plea&s;ed, however, that <HI>this</HI> has proved I was
not &s;o gro&s;ly mi&s;taken in believing him a
loo&s;e man. Mrs. Gerrarde is the fitte&s;t mate
for him, and I am glad they are gone toge|ther.</P>
<P>Sir George was too much mortified at the
flagrant mi&s;conduct of his friend to attempt
<PB N="290" REF="292">
excu&s;ing him: he contented him&s;elf with re|peating,
It was the &s;trange&s;t thing he ever
knew in his life.</P>
<P>My mother then told him Mr. Arnold was
come to town; and that, as things had taken
&s;uch a turn, &s;he hoped her&s;elf to be able to
bring him to the u&s;e of his judgment; and
therefore thought it would not be at all ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for my brother to interfere. Sir
George &s;aid, With all his heart; if her la|dy&s;hip
&s;hould be able to patch up a reconcili|ation
that would &s;ave his &s;i&s;ter's credit, and
&s;he could be &s;o <HI>extremely</HI> pliant as to think
of living with &s;uch a hu&s;band again, he
&s;hould not give him&s;elf any further trouble
about the matter; but in <HI>his</HI> opinion, the
affair wore a much odder a&s;pect than it did
before. I find Mr. Faulkland's behaviour
&s;ticks with him, and has a little cooled his
zeal towards him.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 25&mdash;I have had a letter
from Patty, who confirms my lady V&mdash;'s
account of the lovers flight; and &s;he tells
me one of Mrs. Gerrarde's &s;ervants is gone
off expre&s;s to town; I &s;uppo&s;e to bring Mr.
Arnold the news: for they are all in confu&s;i|on
at her hou&s;e, and know not what is be|come
of their mi&s;tre&s;s; but they are certain
&s;he is gone with Mr. Faulkland. Patty
adds, The &s;ervants believe this &s;cheme had
been long concerted, Mr. Faulkland having
<PB N="291" REF="293">
been a private vi&s;itor to their mi&s;tre&s;s for a
good while.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s I am a&s;toni&s;hed at it: it
has &s;unk the man extremely in my opinion.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 26. Mi&s;s Burchell has ju&s;t been
here. Poor creature &s;he is quite &s;tunned
with the news: &s;he could &s;carce believe it at
fir&s;t, 'till my mother de&s;ired I would &s;hew
her lady V&mdash;'s and Patty's letter, which cor|roborated
all &s;he &s;aid. She then gave way to
tears and lamentations; &s;aying, That cruel
woman was born to be the de&s;truction of eve|ry-body
&s;he had any connection with. <HI>I</HI> have
found it &s;o; <HI>you,</HI> madam (to me), have done
&s;o too; Mr. Arnold, I believe, has been a
great &s;ufferer; Mr. Faulkland is <HI>now</HI> her
victim. Incon&s;iderate and barbarous as he
is, I grieve for him.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 30.&mdash;I have heard nothing of
Mr. Arnold. Indeed it is hardly po&s;&s;ible
that I &s;hould: we are &s;hut up here from all
commerce with the world. My mother's
illne&s;s has confined her to her bed-chamber;
we admit no vi&s;itors, and I never leave her.
I long to know how he takes the ingra|titude
of his mi&s;tre&s;s; but I &s;ee no-body
who conver&s;es with him. My brother and
Mi&s;s Burchell are the only people we &s;ee.
The latter is pretty often with us; as for Sir
George, he only looks in upon us now and
then, and we all &s;eem in an aukward &s;itua|tion.
I wi&s;h my mother were well enough
<PB N="292" REF="294">
to call on Mr. Arnold: I am very anxious
to know what his &s;entiments are; at lea&s;t in
regard to Mrs. Gerrarde.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 6.&mdash;I have been almo&s;t a&s;leep,
my dear Cecilia, for this week pa&s;t; but I
have been rouzed this morning in a mo&s;t ex|traordinary
manner. Sir George called on
us; he ran up &s;tairs in a violent hurry; and
had a countenance when he entered the room;
that &s;poke wonders before he opened his
mouth. He hardly gave him&s;elf time to a&s;k
me how I did (though he had not &s;een me
for three days), before he took a bundle of
papers out of his pocket, which he gave me.
'Tis from Faulkland, &s;aid he, and may be
worth your knowledge. Upon opening the
cover, I found it contained at lea&s;t, four
&s;heets of paper, written on every &s;ide. Ble&s;s
me, brother, &s;aid I, do you expect I &s;hould
take the trouble to read all this? He an|&s;wered,
You may read it at your lei&s;ure: you
will find it will pay you for the the mighty
trouble of a peru&s;al. Sir George left me
pre&s;ently; and having read this extraordinary
letter to my&s;elf, for I happened to be in my
own room when my brother came to me, I
&s;ate me down to give you a copy of it. My
mother, who coughed almo&s;t the whole
night, is now endeavouring to get a little
&s;leep; &s;o that I will &s;cribble on as fa&s;t as I
can, while I have no interruption.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="293" REF="295">
<OPENER><DATELINE>Boulogne, <DATE>Nov. 30, 1704.</DATE></DATELINE>
My dear Bidulph,</OPENER>
<P>I am in ha&s;te to vindicate my&s;elf to you,
but in much more ha&s;te to do &s;o to Mrs.
Arnold; who, if &s;he be&s;tows a thought at
all on me, mu&s;t, I am &s;ure, hold me in the
utmo&s;t contempt; and great rea&s;on would
&s;he have, if things were always as they ap|pear.
Methinks I &s;ee her beautiful &s;corn at
hearing I had carried off Mrs. Gerrarde.
What a paltry fellow <HI>you</HI> mu&s;t think me too.
And yet I <HI>have</HI> carried her off, and &s;he is
now in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, not di&s;plea&s;ed with
her &s;ituation; and I might, if I would, be as
happy as Mrs. Gerrarde can make me: but
I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir George, I have no de&s;igns
but what are for the good both of her &s;oul
and body; and I have hitherto treated her
like a ve&s;tal. What a paradox is here,
&s;ay you? But have patience 'till I tell you
the &s;tory of my knight-errantry.</P>
<P>You are to know then, that as Arnold's
amour with Mrs. Gerrarde was no &s;ecret at
V&mdash;hall, from the moment I heard it, I
meditated a de&s;ign of breaking the dete&s;table
union; not out of regard either to him or
her, but in hopes of re&s;toring, to the mo&s;t
amiable of women, a be&s;otted hu&s;band's
heart, which nothing but downright magic,
infernal witchcraft, could have robbed her
of. The woman is hand&s;ome, 'tis true;
but &s;he is a &s;illy toad, and as fanta&s;tic as an
<PB N="294" REF="296">
ape. I had formed this de&s;ign, I &s;ay, from
the fir&s;t notice I had of the intrigue; and in
con&s;equence of this, re&s;olved to renew my
acquaintance with Mrs. Gerrarde: for I had
<HI>known</HI> her before; known her to my co&s;t.
She it was, this identical devil, whom I have
now in my power, that was the cau&s;e of Mi&s;s
Burchell's misfortune; and therefore the re|mote
cau&s;e of my lo&s;ing Mi&s;s Bidulph. Had
it not been for her, I &s;hould never have had
the fall of that unhappy girl to an&s;wer for.
<HI>I</HI> &s;hould not, I &s;ay, (mark that); for the
mercenary witch was determined to &s;ell her
to &s;omebody, when my ill &s;tars threw me in
her way. I do not rank this affair in the
number of capital crimes; and yet I never
think of it without a pang. If half of my
fortune would retrieve the girl's peace of
mind, I would give it freely: but it is pa&s;t
now, and cannot be helped. She had the
good fortune never to be &s;u&s;pected; and if
&s;he keeps her own council, probably never
will. If I die a batchelor (as I believe I
&s;hall,) I will leave her my whole fortune.
What can a man do more?</P>
<P>How I ramble from my &s;ubject! I meant
only to tell you what my de&s;ign was in carry|ing
off Mrs. Gerrarde. In order to effect it,
as I &s;aid before, it was nece&s;&s;ary for me to
renew my acquaintance with her; and ac|cordingly
I put on a bold face, and made
her a vi&s;it. She was not &s;urprized at this, our
<PB N="295" REF="297">
former intimacy giving a &s;ufficient pretence
for it. She received me with a plea&s;ed fa|miliarity,
which convinced me my company
was far from being di&s;agreeable to her; and
I am &s;ure, had my views been other than they
were, I &s;hould have met with as kind a recep|ption
as my heart could have wi&s;hed; for &s;he
certainly thought of retaining me in her &s;ervice
unknown to Arnold. I was &s;oon aware of
this; for, though &s;he often de&s;ired to &s;ee me,
&s;he always contrived it at &s;uch times, as &s;he
was &s;ure, of not being &s;urprized by him.
This was, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, meeting my
purpo&s;e half way; but though I wanted to
di&s;engage her from Arnold, I did not mean
to &s;acrifice my&s;elf to her; and our views, in
the material point, were very different: mine
were only to part her from her gallant; her's
were to &s;hare her favours between us: for
&s;he did not intend to let go her hold on him;
and I believe my backwardne&s;s, in pu&s;hing
my good fortune, began to di&s;gu&s;t her; but
the time for carrying my plan into execution
was not yet arrived; it could not be 'till Ar|nold's
departure from South-Park. I meant
to carry Mrs. Gerrarde away with the appear|ance
of her own con&s;ent; and I knew this
was impo&s;&s;ible, whil&s;t her lover remained &s;o
near her. I had formed but a rough &s;ketch
of my plan when I received your letter,
which &s;ummoned me to Sidney-Ca&s;tle; and
I re&s;olved not to apprize you of it, 'till my
<PB N="296" REF="298">
enterprize was crowned with &s;ucce&s;s; more
e&s;pecially as you were then quite ignorant of
your &s;i&s;ter's wrongs.</P>
<P>On my return from vi&s;iting you, the fir&s;t
news I heard at V&mdash;hall was, that Mr. Ar|nold
and his lady were parted. I cur&s;t my
own dilatorine&s;s, that I had not executed my
plan before things were brought to &s;uch ex|tremities;
for I well knew it was that artful
fiend who had occa&s;ioned it, though I then
little thought how fatally <HI>I</HI> had contributed
towards the misfortune of the ever-amiable
and mo&s;t re&s;pectable of women.</P>
<P>Lady V&mdash;told me, that your &s;i&s;ter,
having di&s;covered her hu&s;band's infidelity,
had left him on that account; but my lord
&s;oon let me into the whole &s;ecret. Oh! Sir
George, that angel, who de&s;erved the fir&s;t
monarch in the univer&s;e, to be ca&s;t off by
an undi&s;cerning dolt! and <HI>I,</HI> tho' innocent|ly,
the accur&s;ed cau&s;e. I cannot think with
patience of what the divine creature has &s;uf|fered
on my account; but was it not all,
from the beginning, owing to Mrs. Ger|rarde,
that avenging fury, &s;ent on earth as a
&s;courge for the &s;ins of me and of my ance&s;|tors;&mdash;I
rave&mdash;but no wonder&mdash;I am
mad upon this &s;ubject.&mdash;But to return: I
then recollected, that the day before I &s;et out
for Sidney-Ca&s;tle, I received a me&s;&s;age from
Mrs. Gerrarde in the morning, de&s;iring my
company to drink coffee with her that even|ing.
<PB N="297" REF="299">
I obeyed the &s;ummons, little expecting
to meet Mrs. Arnold at her hou&s;e, whom I
had never &s;een there before. The effect my
pre&s;ence had on her extremely &s;urprized me:
&s;he pre&s;ently quitted the room. Mrs. Ger|rarde
took that opportunity of telling me,
that &s;he had dropped in on her very unex|pectedly;
but as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he would go
directly away, we &s;hould have an hour to
chat by our&s;elves. She then followed your
&s;i&s;ter out, and I remained alone in the par|lour.
Whil&s;t I was reflecting on this odd
rencounter, which I did not then imagine
had been brought about by de&s;ign, Mrs.
Gerrarde came into me, &s;aying, your &s;i&s;ter
was &s;o ill &s;he was under a nece&s;&s;ity of ac|companying
her home, and had ordered her
chariot for that purpo&s;e: &s;he made an apo|logy
for being obliged to leave me, and &s;aid
&s;he &s;hould be glad to &s;ee me the next day.
I took my leave and in going out &s;aw Mr.
Arnold at the door, which I judged was
the true rea&s;on of Mrs. Gerrarde's di&s;|mi&s;&s;ing
me.</P>
<P>I &s;et out for Wilt&s;hire the next morning;
and though there was &s;omething odd in the
whole of this incident, I believed it was owing
to chance alone, and thought no more of it;
'till upon my Lord V&mdash;'s telling me the
true cau&s;e of your &s;i&s;ter's di&s;grace, I found
that this &s;erpent had laid the whole plan on
purpo&s;e to de&s;troy her. You &s;ee (for to be
<PB N="298" REF="300">
&s;ure you know all the particulars) how &s;he
&s;educed the innocent Mrs. Arnold into this
fatal vi&s;it, having fir&s;t engaged me to come
at the very point of time when &s;he knew the
hu&s;band would &s;urprize us; for <HI>his</HI> coming,
you may be &s;atisfied, was not unexpected.</P>
<P>I own to you, Sir George, in the fir&s;t mo|tions
of my rage, I could have &s;tabbed Ar|nold,
Mrs. Gerrarde and my&s;elf; but my
Lord V&mdash;calmed my tran&s;ports, by telling
me that it was your &s;i&s;ter's earne&s;t reque&s;t
that this dete&s;table &s;ecret &s;hould be kept
from my knowledge; and that lady V&mdash;,
who had entru&s;ted him with it, would never
forgive him if &s;he knew he had divulged it.
This reflection brought me back to my &s;en&s;es,
and I burned with impatience to execute my
fir&s;t plan, which Mrs. Gerrarde's repeated
crimes now called upon me to accelerate. I
communicated my de&s;ign to lord V&mdash;, who
was delighted with it; for he perfectly
adores your &s;i&s;ter. This, &s;aid he, though
not &s;uch a vengeance as that wicked woman
de&s;erves, mu&s;t, in the end, be productive of
what you wi&s;h, and Mrs. Arnold may be re|&s;tored
to her peace, without injury to her
character, or mi&s;chief to any-body.</P>
<P>Having &s;ettled my mea&s;ures with lord
V&mdash;, I went to pay a vi&s;it to Mrs.
Gerrarde. The cockatrice affected to &s;peak
with &s;urprize and concern of your &s;i&s;ter's
&s;eparation from her hu&s;band. I a&s;ked her,
<PB N="299" REF="301">
had &s;he, who was &s;o intimate with both,
heard any rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for it? She &s;hook
her head, and by a pretended &s;orrow in her
looks, and a my&s;terious &s;ilence, invited me
to pre&s;s for an explanation of her meaning.
She told me at length, with a &s;eeming reluct|ance,
that &startq;poor Mrs. Arnold, though to
be &s;ure &s;he was a &s;en&s;ible woman, was not
without the little frailties and pa&s;&s;ions of
her &s;ex; and that <HI>a&s;toni&s;hing</HI> and <HI>groundle&s;s</HI>
as her &s;u&s;picions were, &s;he had taken it
into her head to be jealous of Mr. Arnold;
and with whom do you think, of all peo|ple
in the world, &s;he &s;u&s;pects him?&endq; I can|not
imagine, &s;aid I. Why truly with <HI>me,</HI>
replied the undaunted Jezabel, and looked
as if &s;he expected <HI>I</HI> &s;hould be as much
amazed as &s;he pretended to be. I affected
to laugh at it; and changing the di&s;cour&s;e,
put an end to my vi&s;it.</P>
<P>The mea&s;ures I had to ob&s;erve required
&s;ome management. It would not an&s;wer
the full extent of my purpo&s;e to rob Mr.
Arnold of his dear, if it did not appear at
the &s;ame time that &s;he had left him with her
con&s;ent. To bring about this it was nece&s;&s;ary
that the flight on her part &s;hould &s;eem pre|meditated;
which would not carry any face,
unle&s;s &s;he took with her &s;uch of her move|ables
as were mo&s;t valuable. This I knew
could not be done without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
her maid, whom I therefore not only re&s;olved
<PB N="300" REF="302">
to tru&s;t, but al&s;o to make her a partner in
her mi&s;tre&s;s's elopement.</P>
<P>Having &s;ettled thus much of my plan in
my own mind, I began my operations, by
making the maid pre&s;ents every time I vi|&s;ited
the mi&s;tre&s;s; and I took care to give
the&s;e vi&s;its as much the air of an amour as I
po&s;&s;ibly could. I dare &s;wear the girl thought
Mrs. Gerrarde and I were upon the be&s;t
terms imaginable. I affected to come at
&s;uch hours as I was &s;ure Mrs. Gerrarde was
alone; I always made my vi&s;its very &s;hort,
as if through fear of being &s;urprized with
her; and went &s;o far as to leave my chariot
(when I came in it) at a di&s;tance from the
hou&s;e, and walked to it alone, with the cau|tion
of one fearful of being ob&s;erved. It
was a matter of indifference to me whether
Mrs. Gerrarde knew of this or not; my
bu&s;ine&s;s was only to excite &s;u&s;picions of an
intrigue among&s;t her &s;ervants, in order to
an&s;wer a future purpo&s;e: but if &s;he were to
know with what extreme precaution I vi&s;ited
her, my prudence could not but be very agree|able
to her: &s;he had her mea&s;ures to ob&s;erve
as well as my&s;elf. As it was of con&s;equence
to her to conceal our acquaintance from Ar|nold's
knowledge, &s;he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be
plea&s;ed at the pains I took (without her lay|ing
her&s;elf open in making the reque&s;t) to
conceal it from him; and &s;he &s;aw I was
<PB N="301" REF="303">
as careful as &s;he could wi&s;h, never to interfere
with him.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, we carried on a private inter|cour&s;e,
that, if it could not be called gal|lantry,
was &s;omething very like it; for I
amu&s;ed, complimented, and flattered her &s;o
agreeably, that I believe &s;he began to think
her&s;elf &s;ure of me, and wondered I did not
make a better u&s;e of the favourable di&s;po&s;i|tion
&s;he was in towards me; but I trifled
with &s;uch dexterity, that even &s;he, with all
the cunning &s;he is mi&s;tre&s;s of, could not po&s;|&s;ibly
fathom my de&s;ign.</P>
<P>Having thus laid the foundation of my
plot, I made no doubt of being able to exe|cute
it, with my lord V&mdash;'s a&s;&s;i&s;tance: he
was in raptures at the thoughts of our enter|prize,
and &s;wore he would never have for|given
me, if I had not allowed him a &s;hare
in it. He &s;aid, I would give my right-hand
to make Mrs. Arnold happy; adding, be|&s;ides
it will &s;ave her hu&s;band from de&s;tructi|on;
for, to my knowledge, that woman has
already almo&s;t ruined his fortune.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked him, might we venture to let my
lady into the &s;ecret? He &s;aid, by no means;
my lady was too &s;queami&s;h to be tru&s;ted with
&s;uch a notable exploit; but, when the af|fair
was over, he would take upon him to ex|cu&s;e
me to her, after he had diverted him|&s;elf
a little with her &s;urprize.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="304">
I fretted to death at Arnold's &s;taying &s;o
long in the country, as it delayed my enter|prize.
There was one circum&s;tance that a
little compen&s;atsd for this vexation; and that
was, that my long &s;tay at V&mdash;hall, which
could be no &s;ecret to him, though he drop|ped
vi&s;iting there on purpo&s;e to avoid me,
might in &s;ome mea&s;ure help to efface his in|jurious
&s;u&s;picions with regard to his lady and
me; be&s;ides, it gave the better colour to
my other de&s;igns.</P>
<P>At la&s;t the long-&s;ought-for opportunity
arrived. Arnold was obliged to go to Lon|don
on his Law-affairs. I took care to in|form
my&s;elf of the day from Mrs. Ger|rarde's
maid; and learnt at the &s;ame time
that her mi&s;tre&s;s purpo&s;ed going to town in
a week after; for &s;he &s;till endeavoured to
&s;ave appearances, and dared to the la&s;t to
pretend to reputation. I propo&s;ed giving a
ball, to take my leave of the ladies, on the
night &s;ub&s;equent to the day fixed for Arnold's
departure from South-park. My lord, al|mo&s;t
as anxious for the event as my&s;elf, im|mediatly
di&s;patched invitations all over the
neighbourhood: there was not a per&s;on of
any fa&s;hion left una&s;ked. Mr. Arnold and
Mrs. Gerrarde, you may be &s;ure, were not
forgot. From the former, as we expected,
we received a civil apology; from the latter,
a me&s;&s;age that &s;he would be &s;ure to come.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="305">
This was at the di&s;tance of eight days
from the appointed time. In the interim,
I continued to vi&s;it Mrs. Gerrarde as u&s;ual,
and took care to be&s;peak her for a partner.
Arnold went to town as opportunely as we
could wi&s;h. I called on Mrs. Gerrarde the
&s;ame morning; and having my lord's per|mi&s;&s;ion
for it, engaged her to come early
enough to drink tea, as there were a great
many ladies invited for the &s;ame purpo&s;e;
and, at going away, I dropped a few my&s;|terious
hints to her maid.</P>
<P>In the evening there was a very large
company met at V&mdash;hall; and having con|certed
my whole plan, when the ladies were
engaged at the tea-table, I &s;lipped out,
mounted my hor&s;e, and rode to Mrs. Ger|rarde's
hou&s;e. I de&s;ired to &s;ee her maid;
and, taking her a&s;ide, told her not to be
&s;urprized; but that her lady was to go off
with me that night: that the thing had, for
certain rea&s;ons, not been determined on
'till that very evening: that I had ju&s;t
&s;natched a minute to de&s;ire her to get all
her ladies trinkets together, and whatever
money and bills&punc; &s;he might have in her e&s;|crutore,
In order to this, I gave a parcel
of &s;mall keys, which I had carried in my
pocket for the purpo&s;e; and bid her hold
her&s;elf in readine&s;s again&s;t &s;even o'clock,
when a per&s;on &s;hould call on her, who would
<PB N="304" REF="306">
conduct her to a place where &s;he would find
her lady and me.</P>
<P>I needed no arguments to per&s;uade the
girl; the thing appeared plau&s;ible enough:
&s;he was fully convinced of the intimacy be|tween
her mi&s;tre&s;s and me; and knowing
her too well to have a doubt of her ba&s;e|ne&s;s,
&s;he concluded I acted by Mrs. Ger|rarde's
directions, and promi&s;ed punctually
to obey them. She &s;aid, &s;he could ea&s;ily
convey away in the dark as many things as
&s;he could conveniently carry; and, to a|void
ob&s;ervation from the re&s;t of the &s;er|vants,
&s;he would wait at a cottage hard by,
which &s;he named to me, 'till her conductor
arrived.</P>
<P>Whether any of the keys I gave her
would fit the locks or not, I was not much
concerned; if they did not, I concluded
&s;he would think her mi&s;tre&s;s had made a mi&s;|take;
and that &s;he would force them open,
rather than fail. Having &s;ettled this material
point, I got back to my Lord V&mdash;'s, with|out
having been mi&s;&s;ed by the company.</P>
<P>Our ball was very well conducted; I
danced with Mrs. Gerrarde, and we pa&s;&s;ed
a very agreeable evening. We &s;upped at
twelve, and &s;he had ordered her chariot to
come a little after that hour; but I had given
my fellows their cue. As the dancing was
not renewed, the company broke up be|tween
one and two. Mrs. Gerrarde was
<PB N="305" REF="307">
one of the fir&s;t that offered to go; but as
her &s;ervants were not to be found, &s;he was
detained 'till every body el&s;e had taken their
leave. At length her coachman and foot|man
were found in the cellar, with one of
my men, all &s;o drunk that they were not
able to &s;tand. Her &s;ervants were really &s;o,
and mine counterfeited &s;o well, there was
no di&s;covering the cheat. In this emergen|cy,
nothing was more natural than the
offering my &s;ervants to attend her home,
and of cour&s;e to wait on her my&s;elf to &s;ee
her &s;afe. She readily accepted the fir&s;t of|fer,
but declined the other. This was ea&s;ily
got over; I handed her into her chariot,
and &s;tepped in after her. Our route was
&s;ettled: we drove from my lord V&mdash;'s
door; and turning &s;hort from the road
that led to Mrs. Gerrarde's hou&s;e, we &s;truck
down a lane which was to carry us by cro&s;s|roads
to our fir&s;t de&s;tined &s;tage, which was
at the di&s;tance of &s;even miles. This was
no other than a poor gardener's hou&s;e, to
which place two of my emi&s;&s;aries had been
di&s;patched that day to wait our coming,
with a travelling chariot, and 4 &s;tout hor&s;es.
I had taken care, according to promi&s;e, to
&s;end a tru&s;ty groom for the maid, with a
boy to carry her luggage. They were both
well mounted, and had orders to carry her
to an inn on the road to Roche&s;ter, and
within about a mile of the town. This inn
<PB N="306" REF="308">
was kept by a fellow, who had formerly
been my &s;ervant; I had placed him there,
and he was entirely at my devotion. He
had already received his in&s;tructions, and his
hou&s;e was to be our &s;econd &s;tage. I con|cluded
the maid had arrived there long be|fore
us, having had &s;ix or &s;even hours the
&s;tart of us, and the place was not more
than twenty miles from her own hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gerrarde was not immediately aware
of our going out of the road; &s;he was in
high &s;pirits, and I kept her in chat. As
&s;oon as &s;he perceived it, &s;he cried out, with
&s;ome &s;urprize, Lord, Mr. Faulkland! where
is the fellow carrying us? He has mi&s;&s;ed his
way. She called to him; but the coach|man,
who had orders not to &s;top unle&s;s I
&s;poke to him, only drove the fa&s;ter. Pray
do call to him, &s;aid &s;he; the wretch has
certainly got drunk with the re&s;t of the &s;er|vants.
I told her there was no po&s;&s;ibility of
turning in the narrow road in which we
then were: that when we got out of it, I
would &s;peak to the coachman; and begged
of her, in the mean while, not to be fright|ened.
The lane was a very long one, but
our rapid wheels &s;oon carried us to the end
of it, where I had appointed Pivet and one
of my footmen to meet us on hor&s;eback. I
had another &s;ervant behind the chariot, whom
I purpo&s;ed to &s;end back with it in the morning.</P>
<P>At the &s;ight of two hor&s;emen, who were
apparently waiting for us, &s;he &s;creamed
<PB N="307" REF="309">
out, Oh! the villain he has brought us here
to be robbed. She had a good many jew|els
on her, and, to &s;ay the truth, had &s;ome
rea&s;on for her fears. The chariot had now
got on a good open road, and the hor&s;es ra|ther
flew than galloped. The two hor&s;emen
joined us, and kept up with us at full &s;peed.
I &s;aw &s;he was heartily frightened, and
thought it time to undeceive her. I was
not ill-natured enough to keep her longer
under the apprehen&s;ions of highwaymen,
and thought &s;he would be le&s;s &s;hocked at
finding there was a de&s;ign upon her per&s;on,
than on her diamond ear-rings. Now, &s;aid $word$,
taking one of her hands with rather more
freedom than re&s;pect, &s;ince we are out of
all danger of di&s;covery, or any po&s;&s;ibility
of pur&s;uit, I will tell you a &s;ecret; and I
&s;poke with an ea&s;y a&s;&s;ured tone. She drew
her hand away. What do you mean, Sir?
Nothing, madam, but to have the plea&s;ure
of your company in a little trip I am going
to take: believe me, you are not in the lea&s;t
danger; you are under my protection;
tho&s;e are my &s;ervants that you &s;ee riding
with us; and you may judge of the value
I &s;et upon you, by the pains I have taken
to get you into my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Lord, Mr.
Faulkland! why &s;ure you can't be &s;erious!
Never more &s;o in my life, madam; I have
long had a de&s;ign upon you; but your con|nection
with Mr. Arnold&mdash;<HI>My</HI> connection
with Mr. Arnold, Sir! interrupting me; I
<PB N="308" REF="310">
don't under&s;tand you!&mdash;Come, come, Mrs.
Gerrarde; you and I are old acquaintance,
you know; 'tis no time for di&s;&s;embling. He
has been a happy man long enough: 'tis
time for a woman of your &s;pirit to be tired
of him; e&s;pecially as I may think I may
&s;ay, without vanity, you do not change for
the wor&s;e in falling into my hands. The
lady had now di&s;covered her courage; &s;he
was no longer in fears of being robbed, and
her &s;pirits returned. You audacious crea|ture!
how dare you treat me thus? Have
you the a&s;&s;urance to in&s;inuate that there
was any thing criminal in my attachment
to Mr. Arnold and his family? My dear
madam, I accu&s;e you of no attachment to
any of his family; he him&s;elf was the only
favoured per&s;on&mdash;Sure there never was &s;uch
an impertinent wretch!&mdash;But I know the
author of this &s;candal: it was Mrs.&mdash;
(and &s;he dared to profane your &s;i&s;ter's
honoured name); but I de&s;pi&s;e her; and
Mr. Arnold &s;hall &s;oon know how I have
been affronted; and &s;he fell a crying.&mdash;My
dear Mrs. Gerrarde, I beg your pardon;
I did not mean to offend you: if Mr. Ar|nold
admired you, he did no more than
what every man does who &s;ees you. I be|&s;eech
you to compo&s;e your&s;elf; by all that is
good, I mean you no harm; be calm, I con|jure
you, and don't &s;poil the prettie&s;t face
in England with crying. A daring, pro|voking
creature, &s;he &s;obbed; what could
<PB N="309" REF="311">
put &s;uch an attempt as this in your head?
and to what place are you carrying me?
Only to France, my dear creature: have
you ever been there? To France, to France!
&s;he exclaimed; and do you dare to think
you &s;hall carry me there? Oh! you'll like
it of all things, &s;aid I, when you get there.&mdash;What
do you think her reply was? Why,
neither more nor le&s;s than a good box in
the ear. I catched hold of her hand, and
ki&s;&s;ed it: you charming vixen, how I ad|mire
you for your &s;pirit! She endeavoured
to wre&s;t her hand from me; but I held
them both fa&s;t, for fear of another blow.
Ba&s;e, in&s;olent, ravi&s;her, villain! As &s;he
ro&s;e in her epithets, I replied with, lovely,
charming, adorable, tender, gentle creature&mdash;She
cried again; but they were &s;piteful
tears, and did not create in me the lea&s;t
touch of that pity, which, on any other oc|ca&s;ion,
they might have moved me to.</P>
<P>I was glad our altercations had a &s;hort
truce, by the chariot's &s;topping at the gar|dener's
cottage, where I had ordered my
equipage to wait. All the family were in
bed but the man's wife, who came curt'&s;y|ing
to the door. I led, or rather lifted,
Mrs. Gerrarde out of the chariot; for &s;he
would not give me her hand; and begging
&s;he would repo&s;e her&s;elf for a few minutes,
whil&s;t I gave orders to my &s;ervants, put
her into the good woman's hands. She
went &s;ullenly in, without making me any
<PB N="310" REF="312">
an&s;wer: and &s;eeing nobody but the old wo|man,
&s;he was convinced that complaints,
or an attempt to e&s;cape, would be equally
fruitle&s;s, and &s;o prudently acquie&s;ced. I
&s;oon di&s;patched my orders: I made the
footman, who came behind the chariot,
mount the box, and directed him to an inn
in the next village to Mrs. Gerrarde's hou&s;e,
and from thence to &s;end it home by &s;ome
one who did not know to whom it belong|ed.
I then ordered my own equipage to
the door; and entering the cottage, told
the lady I was ready to attend her. The old
woman pre&s;ently vani&s;hed; &s;o that &s;eeing
nobody to apply to, &s;he &s;uffered me very
quietly to put her into my chariot, and I
placed my&s;elf by her. It was made on
purpo&s;e for travelling, and I took care to
have nothing but wooden windows; to
which I had the precaution to add a couple
of &s;pring-locks, which &s;hut on drawing up,
and were not without difficulty to be open|ed.
One of the windows was already up,
and I flurted up the other as &s;oon as I got
into the coach. It was a fine moonlight
morning, the po&s;tillion cracked his whip,
and, though the roads were deep and dirty,
the four hor&s;es darted away like lightning.</P>
<P>I believe, madam, &s;aid I, you are by
this time convinced that my &s;cheme is
too well laid to be baffled by any efforts
you can make. I mean to you treat with due
re&s;pect, and beg you will u&s;e me with a
<PB N="301" REF="313">
little more gentlene&s;s than you have done;
that is all the favour I &s;hall a&s;k in return,
'till you your&s;elf are di&s;po&s;ed to &s;hew me more.</P>
<P>You are the mo&s;t amazing creature, &s;aid
&s;he, that ever breathed! What is the mean|ing
that, in the whole cour&s;e of our acquaint|ance,
your behaviour never gave me room
to believe that you were &s;erious in your de|&s;igns
on me, and now at once you &s;ou&s;e
upon your prey like a hawk? I'll an&s;wer
you in two words, &s;aid I. When we fir&s;t
met, you had a hu&s;band; &s;ince the renewal
of our acquaintance (you'll pardon me), it
was no &s;ecret that you had a favoured lover
in Mr. Arnold: I am not of a temper to
&s;olicit a lady by &s;tealth, and I would
not give a pinch of &s;nuff for the woman
who is not entirely at my di&s;po&s;al. Your
attachments to Arnold forbad this, and I
was determined to have you all to my&s;elf.
My attatchments to Mr. Arnold! cried
&s;he, impudently, again. Ay, &s;aid I, cool|ly,
it began to be talked of &s;o openly, that
your reputation was mangled at every tea-table
in the country; and had you &s;taid
much longer there, you would have found
your&s;elf de&s;erted by every female of cha|racter
that knew you. Mr. Arnold's part|ing
with his wife, was by every-body charg|ed
to your account; and as &s;he is reckoned
a very <HI>good &s;ort</HI> of a woman (was not that a
pretty phra&s;e?) every one took her part,
and were not &s;paring in their invectives
<PB N="312" REF="314">
again&s;t you. Add to all this that Arnold
has certainly run out of his fortune, and is
&s;o involved that it will not be po&s;&s;ible for
him long to make tho&s;e returns of genero|&s;ity
which your merit de&s;erves.&mdash;You and
I have been acquainted long; I am no &s;tran|ger
to your circum&s;tances; I know, at
Captain Gerrarde's death, your pen&s;ion as
his widow, and the very &s;mall jointure at
A&s;hby, was the whole of your income.
Arnold's love, it is apparent, has hitherto
been bountiful; how long it could be in
his power to continue it &s;o, may be a que&s;|tion
worth your con&s;idering.</P>
<P>I found I had mortified her pride, by
mentioning the narrowne&s;s of her circum|&s;tances,
and the demolition of her character.
If all you &s;ay <HI>were</HI> true, Sir, which is far
from being the ca&s;e, (with a to&s;s of her head,)
you will find it no very ea&s;y matter to make
me amends for what I &s;hall perhaps lo&s;e for
ever by this violence of yours, notwith&s;tand|ing
the <HI>&s;mallne&s;s</HI> of my income, which you
&s;eem &s;o well informed of. I have a con&s;i|derable
&s;um of money, and &s;ome valuable
jewels, lying by me, of which my &s;ervants
may very probably rob me. I a&s;&s;ured her
upon my honour, I would make good to
her every thing &s;he &s;hould lo&s;e through
my means, and would take care her
&s;ituation &s;hould never again be upon the
&s;ame precarious footing which it had been.
I did not chu&s;e to mention the circum&s;tance
<PB N="313" REF="315">
of my having &s;ecured her maid and her mo|ney
too; I re&s;erved that for an agreeable &s;ur|prize.
I had mea&s;ures to ob&s;erve; I did not
want to be on good terms with her too &s;oon
for obvious rea&s;ons, as nothing was farther
from my heart than a thought of gallantry.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, I a&s;&s;umed a more di&s;t|ant
behaviour, and affected to &s;hew her
&s;omething like re&s;pect. I did not drop the
lea&s;t hint of my knowing that Mr. Arnold
had made his lady unea&s;y on my account,
much le&s;s that I &s;u&s;pected her for the wick|ed
contriver of that mi&s;chief. I deferred
the di&s;cu&s;&s;ing of this point 'till a more favou|rable
opportunity &s;hould offer, when it would
be in my power to make a better u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>My de&s;ign was by degrees to make her
&s;atisfied enough with her &s;ituation, not to
wi&s;h to return to Arnold. When I had
once brought her to this, I judged it would
not be difficult to carry her &s;till farther, to
the point was aimed at; and that I, to write
a letter to him of my dictating. You will
think this was a &s;trange expectation, and
yet it was what I re&s;olved to accompli&s;h.
I knew the turn of the mind I had to deal
with: bring a woman of this &s;ort into good-humour,
and it is ea&s;y to wheedle her in|to
compliance. She has no &s;olid under&s;tand|ing;
but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, in the place of it, a &s;ort
of fla&s;hy wit, that impo&s;es on common
hearers, and makes her pa&s;s for what is
<PB N="314" REF="316">
called clever. With a great deal of vanity,
and an affectation of tenderne&s;s, which co|vers
the mo&s;t termagant &s;pirit that ever ani|mated
a female brea&s;t, her ruling and go|verning
pa&s;&s;ion is avarice; and yet, &s;trange
to tell! genero&s;ity is of all things what &s;he
profe&s;&s;es to admire, and is mo&s;t &s;tudious of
having thought her characteri&s;tic. Her pre|ten&s;ions
to this virtue I have oppo&s;ed to her
vice of avarice, as the terms appropriated
to each &s;eem mo&s;t contrary in their natures;
yet I do not mean by genero&s;ity, that boun|teous
di&s;po&s;ition which is commonly under|&s;tood
by the word: no, no; &s;he aimed at
the reputation of this virtue in our more
exalted idea of it, and would fain be thought
a woman of a <HI>great &s;oul.</HI> This phra&s;e was
often in her mouth; and though her whole
conduct gave the lye to her profe&s;&s;ions, &s;he
would tell you fifty &s;tories, without a word
of truth in any of them, to prove how
nobly &s;he had acted on &s;uch and &s;uch
occa&s;ions. On the knowledge of this part
of her temper, I chiefly built my hopes of
&s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>I kept up a &s;ort of forced conver&s;ation
during the re&s;t of our journey. She was
&s;ullen, but not rude. As I was far from
de&s;iring to come to an eclairci&s;&s;ement with
her, I did not wi&s;h to have her in better
temper.</P>
<P>We reached the inn, which was about a
<PB N="315" REF="317">
mile on our &s;ide Roche&s;ter, at eight o'clock
in the morning. This was a favourable hour,
as by that time every traveller mu&s;t have left
the &s;tages they lay at. The hou&s;e &s;tood
alone, and luckily enough had no company
in it. My old &s;ervant, Lamb, had receive|ed
my in&s;tructions by letter, and was pre|pared
accordingly for our reception. This
was the place to which I had ordered
the maid to be carried; &s;he had arrived there
&s;ome time before us, and was &s;afely lodged.</P>
<P>The chariot drove into the court-yard
clo&s;e to the door of the inn; the &s;tep was
let down in an in&s;tant, and Mrs. Lamb
appeared to receive us. We both darted
into the hou&s;e. Dre&s;&s;ed as we were for a ball,
we made an odd appearance as travellers at
that hour in the morning. I believe this con|&s;ideration
made Mrs. Gerrarde very readily
hurry up &s;tairs with the woman of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I enquired for Mrs. Gerrarde's maid, have|ing
given orders to Lamb that &s;he &s;hould
not be &s;een 'till I fir&s;t &s;poke to her. I was
carried into the room where &s;he was: &s;he
&s;eemed very glad that we were arrived. I
de&s;ired her to lay out her lady's toilet, which
I concluded &s;he had brought with her; for
that Mrs. Gerrarde would pre&s;ently put her|&s;elf
in a proper habit for travelling. The
maid told me &s;he had brought her mi&s;tre&s;s's
riding-dre&s;s with her, and as many other
things of her wearing apparel as &s;he could
<PB N="316" REF="318">
conveniently carry. I &s;aw a va&s;t heap of
things lying unpacked on a bed which was
in the room, and a&s;ked her how &s;he had
managed &s;o cleverly as to get &s;uch a number
of things together without ob&s;ervation. She
told me &s;he had lo&s;t no time, from the mi|nute
I left her, 'till the arrival of her guide;
but had employed the interval in carrying
out &s;ome of the be&s;t of her lady's cloaths
piece by piece, and conveying them to the
cottage, which &s;he could ea&s;ily do without
the &s;ervants &s;eeing her; for as it was dark,
&s;he pa&s;&s;ed in and out without ob&s;ervation.
Here &s;he huddled them into a large port|manteau.
After this &s;he went to examine
her lady's e&s;crutore; but was a long time
puzzled in endeavouring to open it, as none
of the keys I had given her an&s;wered. She
endeavoured to force it open with as little
noi&s;e as po&s;&s;ible, but in vain. She then had
recour&s;e to a &s;econd trial of the keys, when
one of them, which probably had been pa&s;s|ed
by before, luckily opened the lock; and
&s;he &s;ecured all the money and jewels &s;he
could find. The&s;e, &s;aid &s;he, kept me in
continual dread all the way as I travelled;
for I have eight hundred pounds in bank
notes; and though my lady has &s;uch a quan|tity
of jewels on her, I am &s;ure I have as ma|ny
more about me, which I have hid in differ|ent
parts of my cloaths.</P>
<P>I commended the girl's diligence, as in|deed
<PB N="317" REF="319">
it de&s;erved; and having before order|ed
tea and coffee into Mrs. Gerrarde's room,
I now went in to breakfa&s;t with her. I found
the woman of the hou&s;e &s;till with her, at
which I was not at all unea&s;y; for as &s;he had
been tutored by her hu&s;band, I knew &s;he was
not to be wrought upon, if Mrs. Gerrarde had
attempted it.</P>
<P>As I did not at that time de&s;ire a <HI>t&ecirc;te &agrave; t&ecirc;te</HI>
with her, I contrived to keep Mrs. Lamb in
the room, by de&s;iring her to drink tea with us.</P>
<P>When we had done breakfa&s;t, I told Mrs.
Gerrarde, that as I feared &s;he was a good
deal fatigued, if it was agreeable to her, we
would remain where we were for that day;
and that I would by all means have her think
of taking &s;ome re&s;t. She &s;aid &s;he was ex|tremely
tired, and &s;hould like to get a little
&s;leep. I think, madam, you had better go
to bed, &s;aid Mrs. Lamb; I have a very qui|et
chamber ready, where no noi&s;e in the
hou&s;e can di&s;turb you. Shew me to it, an|&s;wered
Mrs. Gerrarde, with a tone of wea|rine&s;s
and ill-humour. The woman obeyed;
I followed: &s;he carried her to the door of
the room where the maid was and throwing
it open, Mrs. Gerrarde, who &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he was
attending her, went in: I &s;tepped in after her;
Mrs. Lamb withdrew.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gerrarde's a&s;toni&s;hment at the &s;ight
of her maid, is pa&s;t de&s;cription. Rachael!
in a tone of admiration. Rachael, who did
<PB N="318" REF="320">
not think there was any thing unexpected or
extraordinary in their meeting, quite at a lo&s;s
to gue&s;s at what her mi&s;tre&s;s wondered, an|&s;wered
in her turn with &s;ome &s;urprize, Ma|dam!
and waited, expecting &s;he would give
her &s;ome orders; which finding the lady did
not, the maid a&s;ked her very compo&s;edly,
would &s;he plea&s;e to undre&s;s? I hope, ma|dam,
&s;aid I, &s;tepping forward, that Mrs.
Rachael has taken care to bring you every
thing you may have occa&s;ion for; I &s;hall leave
you in her hands, and wi&s;h you a good re|po&s;e.
Strange, a&s;toni&s;hing creature! &s;aid
Mrs. Gerrarde, looking at me with le&s;s anger
than &s;urprize. <HI>I</HI> bowed, and left the room.</P>
<P>I ordered Mrs. Lamb to have an eye to
my pri&s;oners; and heartily tired as I was,
between dancing and travelling, I undre&s;&s;ed,
and threw my&s;elf into bed. I &s;lept 'till &s;ix
o'clock in the evening; then ro&s;e, and put
my&s;elf into a habit fitter for my journey than
that in which I came; and which I had &s;ent
in a po&s;t-trunk before me, by the me&s;&s;enger
whom I had employed to apprize Lamb
of my coming.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gerrarde was not yet &s;tirring. I
called for Rachael, and a&s;ked her how &s;he
had come off with her lady, upon telling
her the manner of her falling into my &s;nare.
Rachael told me her lady wondered mightily
at my art, and &s;aid I was the <HI>&s;trangest gen|tleman</HI>
that ever was born. My friend Ra|chael
<PB N="319" REF="321">
&s;oftened the expre&s;&s;ion I fancy; I am
&s;ure Mrs. Gerrarde did not call me a &s;trange
<HI>gentleman.</HI> She &s;aid her mi&s;tre&s;s &s;miled two
or three times at her relation, particularly at
my giving her the keys. I found, upon the
whole, that my conduct in &s;ecuring her her
money and her jewels, together with the at|tendance
of her maid, had a good deal ap|pea&s;ed
her re&s;entment.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gerrarde did not ri&s;e 'till near eight
o'clock. I had ordered as elegant a dinner
as the hou&s;e could afford; and the lady have|ing
put her&s;elf into a genteel di&s;habille, with
great alacrity &s;at down to table, and did not
appear to have fretted away her appetite.
I would &s;uffer no one to attend but Racheal.
I told Mrs. Gerrarde that I propo&s;ed &s;etting
out for Dover that night, and that as it
could not be &s;uppo&s;ed her maid &s;hould
be able to ride &s;o far, and that a &s;econd
carriage with four hor&s;es (as le&s;s might not
be able to keep pace with us) would be lia|ble
to ob&s;ervation, I would, if &s;he plea&s;ed,
re&s;ign my place in the chariot to Mrs. Ra|chael,
and attend her my&s;elf on hor&s;eback.
She an&s;wered me coldly, Since &s;he <HI>mu&s;t</HI> go,
it was indifferent to her who was to be her
companion. Though the motive I offered
for this manner of travelling was not without
its weight, yet my true rea&s;on was to avoid
being boxed up &s;o long again with Mrs. Ger|rarde.
My time was not yet come for ex|planations,
<PB N="320" REF="322">
and I was afraid of being upon
good terms with her too &s;oon.</P>
<P>The remainder of the evening was &s;pent
by her and her maid in carefully packing up
their baggage, which had been brought in
a confu&s;ed huddle to the inn. Mrs. Gerrarde
had a convenient trunk bought at Roche&s;ter
for the purpo&s;e, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted her&s;elf in laying
them up &s;afely.</P>
<P>She equipped her&s;elf in a &s;mart riding|dre&s;s,
and at eleven o'clock, without any
great reluctance, permitted me to put her
and her maid into the chariot. The inn
had no company in it, at lea&s;t that we &s;aw;
and our ho&s;t was too di&s;creet to let any of his
&s;ervants be in the way. I mounted my hor&s;e,
and triumphantly galloped off with my
prize.</P>
<P>We reached Dover early next morning,
and immediately got on board the packet.
The lady by this time appeared &s;o perfectly
&s;erene, that I believe in my &s;oul I &s;hould not
have got rid of her, if I had de&s;ired her to
have gone back again; but &s;he had a&s;&s;umed
a new air, and affected a fine tender melan|choly
in her countenance. I gue&s;&s;ed at her
thoughts, and found afterwards my conjec|ture
right. Will you believe me, Sir George,
when I tell you the baggage had formed &s;e|rious
<HI>honourable</HI> de&s;igns upon my per&s;on?
Fact, upon my word. I &s;aw it pre&s;ently
(you know my knack of reading people's
<PB N="321" REF="323">
minds in their faces), and was not &s;orry for
the di&s;covery; for though I determined not
on any account to encourage &s;uch a wild ex|pectation,
yet I intended to make a <HI>di&s;creet</HI>
u&s;e of it; be&s;ides, I knew it would afford
me a handle for keeping a <HI>re&s;pectful</HI> di&s;|tance.</P>
<P>We landed next evening. She had been
very &s;ick at &s;ea, and continued &s;o much
out of order, that &s;he was put to bed as
&s;oon as we got to the inn. She ordered
her maid not to &s;tir from her; the very
thing I wi&s;hed; &s;o that I had nothing to do
but to be very trouble&s;ome in my enquiries
after her health, and very &s;orry for her indi&s;|po&s;ition.</P>
<P>The next morning however &s;et all to
rights; and after congratulating her on her
recovery, and the revival of her beauty, I
told her I meant to carry her to Boulogne,
whither I had &s;ent Pivet the night before to
take lodgings for us, in a private hou&s;e
which he knew. I found that neither Mrs.
Gerrarde nor her maid &s;poke French; a cir|cum&s;tance
I was very glad of, though the
former bitterly lamented her having <HI>forgot</HI>
it. She made not the lea&s;t objection to the
travelling from Calais to Boulogne, as &s;he
had done before; her late indi&s;po&s;ition gave
me a pretence for in&s;i&s;ting on Rachael's at|tending
her in the chariot.</P>
<P>The lodgings Pivet had taken were very
hand&s;ome; our apartments were on the
<PB N="322" REF="324">
&s;ame floor, &s;eparated only by a lobby. Mrs.
Rachael had a little bed fitted up for her by
my directions in her lady's dre&s;&s;ing-room.
Thus far I had &s;ailed before the wind; but
now came the difficult part of my ta&s;k. It
was impo&s;&s;ible for Mrs. Gerrande to conceive
that any thing, but down-right love for her
per&s;on, could have induced me to do what
I had done. I had actually run away with
her, put my&s;elf to &s;ome hazard, and, what
in her e&s;timation was no &s;mall matter, &s;ome
expence too. No other motive had appear|ed
in all my conduct towards her; and tho'
I had not ab&s;olutely made love to her, yet
what other con&s;truction could my actions
bear? for my words, to &s;ay the truth, were
equivocal. She mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have con|cluded
that I had no other view but a piece
of gallantry with her. Her de&s;igns on me
were of a much more &s;erious nature; and
her vanity made her imagine, that, notwith|&s;tanding
my thorough knowledge of her cha|racter,
her cunning, joined to my pa&s;&s;ion,
might lead me into her &s;nare.</P>
<P>Now, I had two nice points to con&s;ider
of, and two difficulties to &s;urmount. The
fir&s;t was, not, by any part of my conduct,
to carry the deception &s;o far, as to give
her the lea&s;t room to hope I could be mad
enough to marry her. This, bad as <HI>&s;he</HI>
is, and extravagant as <HI>I</HI> am, I could not
think of doing, even to gain my favourite
point. The other was, to keep up &s;uch
<PB N="323" REF="325">
an appearance of gallantry towards her as
&s;he mu&s;t naturally expect, and at the &s;ame
time avoid all approaches which u&s;ually
forerun the cata&s;trophe of an amour; than
which nothing was more repugnant to my
wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>To &s;teer between the&s;e two extremes was
the difficult ta&s;k, particularly the latter; for,
between our&s;elves, I began to be much more
afraid of her than &s;he was of me. I knew
it would be impo&s;&s;ible for me to keep up
the farce long; the &s;ooner it was over the
better; and therefore I determined to enter
on my part directly.</P>
<P>I had been ruminating on my project all
the way as I rode. When we arrived at
Boulogne, I found my&s;elf a little out of
order, having caught cold; and as I was
really &s;omewhat feveri&s;h, a thought &s;tarted
into my head, that this illne&s;s might aid me
in my de&s;ign. When we came to our lodg|ings,
I made my excu&s;es to Mrs. Gerrarde for
not being able to attend her: I told her I
found my&s;elf ill, and mu&s;t be obliged to go
to bed. She &s;aid &s;he was <HI>very &s;orry,</HI> and per|haps
&s;he &s;poke truth.</P>
<P>I left her in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her new apart|ment
with her maid Rachael. Their being
&s;trangers to the language of the country cut
off all communication with the people of
the hou&s;e, who could nor &s;peak Engli&s;h. I
introduced Pivet to them, whom they had
never &s;een before (for he had taken par|ticular
<PB N="324" REF="326">
care to keep out of their view dure|ing
the whole journey), as a gentleman who
was to be their interpreter; and having thus
&s;ettled my hou&s;hold, I retired to my bed|chamber.</P>
<P>Not well, nor &s;ick enough to go to bed,
I threw my&s;elf however down on it; and
after revolving in my mind all the occur|rences
of the three or four pa&s;t days, I &s;tarted
up again, &s;at down to my de&s;k, and have
given you, my Bidulph, a faithful narrative
of my proceedings down to the pre&s;ent pe|riod
of time, being Nov. 20, eight o'clock
in the evening.</P>
<P>You may &s;oon expect to have the &s;econd
part of this my delectable hi&s;tory; &lsquo;Shew|ing
how Orlando, not being able to pre|vail,
with all his eloquence, on the as fair
and beautiful, as fierce and inexorable,
Prince&s;s Gerrardina, to put the fini&s;hing
hand to his adventures and mo&s;t wonder|ful
exploits, did, his wrath being moved
thereby, like an ungentle knight, bury
his &s;word in her &s;now-white, but &s;avage
and unrelenting brea&s;t; whereat, being
&s;tung with remor&s;e, he afterwards kills
him&s;elf.&rsquo;</P>
<P>Would not this be a pretty conclu&s;ion of
my adventures? No, no, Sir George, ex|pect
better things from thy friend. I hope
my knight-errantry will not end &s;o tragical|ly.
But ha&s;ten to make my peace with that
gracious creature your &s;i&s;ter: yet why do I
<PB N="325" REF="327">
name her and my&s;elf in the &s;ame &s;entence?
She cares not for me, thinks not of me, or, if
&s;he does, it is with contempt. I &s;aid this
before, and I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> repeat it again; but tell
her, what I have done was wi&s;h a view to pro|mote
her happine&s;s. Oh! may <HI>&s;he</HI> be happy,
whatever becomes of me. I know the means I
have u&s;ed will make her angry; but try to
make her forgive the means for the motive's
&s;ake. Tell her as much of this wild &s;tory as
you think proper; but do not let her &s;ee it
in my wild rambling language; that is only
fit for your own eye.</P>
<P>Your mother, I know, is out of all patience
with me. I am black enough in her opinion al|ready.
This la&s;t action, as far as &s;he has yet
known of it, will dye me ten &s;hades deeper;
but pray put in a word for me there too. I know
&s;he will &s;ay, that &lsquo;we are not to return evil for
evil; and that it is not lawful to do evil,
though to bring forth good.&rsquo; But put
her in mind that there are &s;uch things as
<HI>pious frauds</HI> (though, by-the-bye, I do not
take this of mine to be one of them);
&lsquo;that wicked people are to have their arts
oppo&s;ed <HI>by</HI> arts; and that good people
have not only been permitted, but com|manded
to execute vengeance on &s;inners.&rsquo;
And you may hint at the children of I&s;rael's
being ordered to &s;poil the Aegyptians, tho'
far be it from me to &s;poil Mrs. Gerrarde of
any thing &s;he has. This however, and as
many wi&s;e &s;ayings as you can collect for the
<PB N="326" REF="328">
purpo&s;e, you may &s;tring together; and be
&s;ure you tell her I have hopes of reclaiming
Mrs. Gerrarde from her <HI>evil</HI> cour&s;es, and
do not de&s;pair of prevailing on her to
go into a nunnery; for Mrs. Gerrarde, you
mu&s;t know, was bred a Roman Catholic,
though &s;he conformed on marrying Captain
Gerrarde.</P>
<P>Now put all this into decent language, fit
for that very good woman's ears; for <HI>good</HI> I
mu&s;t call her, notwith&s;tanding &s;he was inex|orable
to me.</P>
<P>I am fatigued with writing &s;o long a
letter&mdash;I feel my di&s;order increa&s;e upon
me; I will be let blood, and hope &s;oon to
give you a good account of my under|taking.
Mean while, if I am not quite
reprobated, write me a line, directed un|der
cover to Mon&s;ieur Larou, at the Po&s;t|hou&s;e,
Boulogne. Farewell, my dear Bidulph;
&s;ick or well, I am ever your's,</P>
<P>O. F.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 7.&mdash;Was there ever &s;uch a
piece of knight errantry? What a mad|cap
is this! Pray, my dear, are you not
a&s;toni&s;hed at him? I am &s;ure I am. I had
not an opportunity to fini&s;h the copying
of this very long letter, which I began ye&s;|terday
morning, 'till very late this night.
My poor mother has been &s;o re&s;tle&s;s, and &s;o
much out of order, the&s;e two days, I de|&s;ired
her leave to read to her Mr. Faulkland's
hi&s;tory (for I can call it by no other name)
as I &s;at by her bed &s;ide. She told me, I
<PB N="327" REF="329">
might let her know the &s;ub&s;tance of what he
&s;aid, as it would fatigue her too much to at|tend
to &s;o long an epi&s;tle.</P>
<P>You would have &s;miled, my Cecilia, at
my good parent's amazement, when I told
her Mr. Faulkland's proceedings, and his
rea&s;ons for them. She would &s;carce give
credit to it at fir&s;t, and I was obliged to re|peat
&s;everal circum&s;tances to her over again.
And &s;o, &s;aid &s;he, this was all on <HI>your</HI> ac|count,
and he had <HI>really</HI> no ill de&s;ign on
Mrs. Gerrarde. I am glad of this for mi&s;s
Burchell's &s;ake, and &s;hall be impatient to tell
her of it. I begged of my mother to wait
a while for the re&s;ult of Mr. Faulkland's
adventure, before &s;he mentioned any thing
of the matter to mi&s;s Burchell. We do
not yet know, &s;aid I, how this matter may
turn out; Mr. Faulkland, to be &s;ure, will
make ha&s;te to communicate to my brother
the i&s;&s;ue of this odd affair, and it will then
be time enough to inform the young lady.</P>
<P>My mother unwillingly con&s;ented to po&s;t|pone
a di&s;covery which he knew would be
&s;o agreeable to mi&s;s Burchell. I applaud
her humanity; but think that, good and
prudent as &s;he is, &s;he is too unre&s;erved in
her confidences. This &s;trange bu&s;ine&s;s is,
I think, at pre&s;ent in too critical a &s;u&s;pence
to tru&s;t the knowledge of it to any body.
If Mr. Faulkland fails in his de&s;ign, his
avowal of it will be far from &s;erving me.
Sir George was with us for a few minutes
<PB N="328" REF="330">
to-day, only to exult in Mr. Faulkland's
recovered credit. Has he not well explain|ed
him&s;elf, &s;aid he? Oh! I knew there mu&s;t
have been &s;ome my&s;tery at the bottom of
that conduct which &s;urprized us all &s;o much.
<HI>There</HI>'s a man for you! Shew me another
who would carry his noble di&s;intere&s;ted love
to &s;uch lengths!</P>
<P>My mother did not like that he &s;hould
run on in that &s;train, and therefore &s;topped
him. The end crowns all, Sir George:
let us &s;ee how your friend will conduct
him&s;elf <HI>through</HI> this tickli&s;h affair. Let
him get through it how he will, an&s;wered my
brother a little bluntly, I think Sidney has
obligations to him &s;he ought never to forget.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 16.&mdash;More intelligence,
my dear; &s;tranger and &s;tranger &s;till! I am
&s;orry I &s;ent off my la&s;t packet, as I am &s;ure
you mu&s;t be impatient for the conclu&s;ion of
Mr. Faulkland's adventure; and then what
&s;orry &s;tuff has the interval been filled up with!
but I will now make you amends. My mo|ther
is better too, thank God! and every thing
promi&s;es well.</P>
<P>Sir George has had a &s;econd packet from
Boulogne. Take the continuation of Mrs.
Gerrarde's hi&s;tory as follows:</P>
<P>How rude is the hand of &s;ickne&s;s, my
Bidulph! it had like to have &s;poiled one of
the be&s;t projects that ever was undertaken,
and con&s;igned to oblivion an action worthy
of immortality. I have been very ill &s;ince
<PB N="329" REF="331">
I la&s;t wrote to you; the di&s;order, which I
then complained of, turned out to be an
ugly fever; and I was for three days in ex|treme
danger. Mrs. Gerrarde was, during
that time, clo&s;ely attended by Pivet, who&s;e
&s;ervices I di&s;pen&s;ed with on that account.
He told me &s;he appeared unea&s;y at my &s;itua|tion,
and enquired con&s;tantly, and <HI>kindly</HI>
too, after my health. When I grew well
enough to &s;it up, I begged the favour of
&s;eeing her in my chamber. She came very
readily, and &s;eemed downright anxious for
my recovery. I told her I hoped &s;he had
been treated with proper care and re&s;pect
during my &s;ickne&s;s. She &s;aid Mr. Pivet was
a very obliging, good-natured man, and had
endeavoured to make her confinement as ea&s;y
to her as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The plan &s;he had formed of turning to
the mo&s;t la&s;ting advantage the inclination
&s;he &s;uppo&s;ed I had for her, inclined her to
a&s;&s;ume a very different behaviour from what
was natural to her. The weakne&s;s of my
condition, while it afforded me a pretence
for a more cold and languid behaviour, than
I could with any colour have put on at another
time, gave her an opportunity of playing off
her arts, and facilitated my de&s;ign beyond
my hopes.</P>
<P>She was &s;eated at my bed-&s;ide: our fir&s;t
conver&s;ation con&s;i&s;ted of nothing but com|plaints
on my &s;ide, and condolements on
<PB N="330" REF="332">
her's. I &s;igned &s;everal times, and &s;he &s;igh|ed
in return. Mrs. Gerrarde, &s;aid I, you
are afflicted; but my illne&s;s has no &s;hare in
your concern. Something el&s;e oppre&s;&s;es you;
you regret the being &s;eparated from Mr.
Arnold, and I am always the object of your
hatred. Neither one nor t'other, an&s;wered
&s;he, in a kind voice. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible to
hate you; you know it is not in nature for
a <HI>woman</HI> to hate &s;uch a man as Mr. Faulk|land.
As for Mr. Arnold, though I <HI>own</HI>
my former weakne&s;s in regard to him, yet
I hope I have &s;omething to plead in
my excu&s;e. I was married very early to an
old man, and had never experienced the
happine&s;s of reciprocal love: he died, and
left me de&s;titute. Mr. Arnold's generous,
though I mu&s;t confe&s;s unwarrantable pa&s;&s;ion,
re&s;cued me from di&s;tre&s;s. I did not know
he was married when I fir&s;t unwarily accepted
of his addre&s;&s;es, and it was too late to retreat
before I found it out; otherwi&s;e the univer&s;e
&s;hould not have tempted me to have li&s;tened
to him.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the affluence I obtained
from him, it often grieved me to think of
the injury I did his wife. There is nothing,
Mr. Faulkland &s;o grating to a generous mind,
and I think I may venture to a&s;&s;ert that <HI>mine</HI> is
one, as to live in a &s;tate of dependence, and,
at the &s;ame time, owe that very dependence
to a vice that you di&s;dain.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="333">
I was delighted to find that &s;he had got
into this &s;train; it was the thing I wi&s;hed,
but dur&s;t hardly hope for without abundance
of trouble on my part, and a di&s;&s;imulation
that was irk&s;ome to me. I knew &s;he had
&s;tudied this &s;peech, and got it by rote to an|&s;wer
her own purpo&s;e; but in this, as is ge|nerally
the ca&s;e of de&s;igning people, &s;he
over&s;hot her&s;elf, and became the dupe to
her own artifice. I laid hold of the cue &s;he
gave: Oh! madam, you charm me! go
on, go on; now indeed you &s;hew a generous
mind: happy would it be for all your &s;ex,
after having deviated from the paths of vir|tue,
if they could return to them with &s;o
good a grace, &s;o ju&s;t a &s;en&s;e of their errors!
To <HI>you,</HI> Sir, &s;aid &s;he, with a &s;olemn air, I
am indebted for my pre&s;ent re&s;olutions: I
hope from this time forward that my life
will be irreproachable. <HI>I</HI> hope &s;o too, ma|dam.
I gue&s;&s;ed &s;he under&s;tood the&s;e words
as favouring her de&s;ign: it was not meet to
undeceive her (a little mental re&s;ervation,
you know, Bidulph): &s;he went on, little
thinking &s;he was forwarding <HI>my</HI> plan, when
&s;he only meant to promote her <HI>own.</HI> I hope
Mr. Arnold will be as &s;en&s;ible of <HI>his</HI> fault
as I am of <HI>mine,</HI> and that he will never fall
into the like indi&s;cretion again. I believe
there can be no true happine&s;s but between
a <HI>married</HI> pair, who &s;incerely love each
other.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="334">
Good! good! thought I; &s;ure my better
genius prompts the woman to &s;peak thus.
Ah! Mrs. Gerrarde, how exactly do your
thoughts corre&s;pond with mine! How ju&s;t
are all your &s;entiments! What a true reli&s;h
have you for virtue! Yes, I hope with you
that Mr. Arnold will be able to tread in your
&s;teps: it is a pity he has not your noble
example before him. Mrs. Arnold is a good
woman, and he might &s;till live with her in
tolerable contentment, if he can get the
better of his irregular pa&s;&s;ion for you. What
a noble triumph of virtuous re&s;olution would
this be, if you your&s;elf were the in&s;trument
to bring this about. For Mrs. Arnold's and
her brother's &s;ake, as well as your own, I
wi&s;h this were fea&s;ible.</P>
<P>I would do any thing in my power, &s;aid
&s;he (thinking &s;he obliged me by the decla|ration);
but I know not by what means &s;uch
an event can be brought to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>I was afraid to urge the matter farther: I
was within an hair's breadth of gaining my
point, but did not think it prudent to pre&s;s
too forward. We'll think of it another
time, &s;aid I, and groaned heavily, as if my
&s;pirits were fatigued with talking. She took
the hint. I am afraid I have tired you; you
have talked too much. I an&s;wered her
faintly, You are very good! She curte&s;ied
to me, and retired with a maje&s;tic &s;tep. I
&s;aw her no more that day: &s;he had got upon
<PB N="333" REF="335">
&s;tilts, and it was not yet time to take her
down. To-morrow may produce a wonder:
I will wait for it. I am really weak, but be|gin
to recover my &s;pirits.</P>
<P>Boulogne, Dec. 6.</P>
<P>Nothing is &s;o conducive to the body's
health, as the mind's being at ea&s;e. I have
proved the truth of this ob&s;ervation: my
&s;oul had been racked with &s;u&s;pence and un|certainty
during my illne&s;s; the unea&s;y &s;tate
of my mind increa&s;ed my di&s;order; the
di&s;order it&s;elf had chiefly given ri&s;e to my
apprehen&s;ions, as pain and &s;ickne&s;s are na|turally
accompanied with a gloomine&s;s of
thought. Thus the cau&s;e and its effects were
united in mutual league again&s;t me, and re|ciprocally
a&s;&s;i&s;ted each other to plague and
torment me.</P>
<P>My fears were entirely on Mrs. Arnold's
account. What, thought I, would be the
con&s;equence of my project, in ca&s;e of my
death? Mrs. Gerrarde will return back to
England; and, upon telling her &s;tory, will
be received again by Arnold; their union
perhaps e&s;tabli&s;hed as firmly as before, and
poor Mrs. Arnold's hopes ruined for ever.
Then I thought what a wretch I mu&s;t appear
in her eyes, doubtful, may be, of my &s;in|cerity
as to the motives I urged to you for
my conduct. On the other hand, if the&s;e
motives &s;hould by any means happen to be
&s;u&s;pected by Mrs. Gerrarde, it might be the
<PB N="334" REF="336">
means of producing the direct contrary ef|fect
from what I intended; and in&s;tead of
bani&s;hing Arnold's cruel &s;u&s;picions of his
lady, only &s;erve to &s;trengthen them; for I
knew Mrs. Gerrarde would leave nothing
un&s;aid or undone for this horrid purpo&s;e;
and it is not every one, Sir George, who&s;e
hearts are enlarged enough to &s;uppo&s;e a man
may now and then take a little pains from
di&s;intere&s;ted principles. This la&s;t &s;ugge&s;tion
of my thoughts made me almo&s;t mad, and
actually brought on a delirium; and what
may &s;eem a paradox, though it is literally
true, the total deprivation of my &s;en&s;es for
two days was the means of my recovering
them afterwards; for I am &s;ure, had I re|tained
enough of them to have ruminated
longer on this fatal &s;uppo&s;ition, and my
di&s;order had &s;till threatened me with death,
I &s;hould have run mad. The care of a &s;kil|ful
phy&s;ician recalled me from the precincts
of the grave; the &s;trength of a con&s;titution,
naturally good, joined to all the re&s;olution I
could mu&s;ter, did the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t u&s;e I made of my recovered rea|&s;on,
was to con&s;ult with my&s;elf in what
manner, or by what means, I &s;hould prevail
on Mrs. Gerrarde to lend a helping hand to
my de&s;ign. Her leaving Arnold to go off with
me, and to all human appearance with her
own con&s;ent, was a material point gained; but
the mo&s;t important of all, and without which
<PB N="335" REF="337">
every thing el&s;e would be fruitle&s;s, was to
get her to acknowledge, under her own
hand, the injury &s;he had done Mrs. Arnold
by her vile in&s;inuations to her hu&s;band. This
was the grand object of all my wi&s;hes. This,
you will &s;ay, was difficult: I confe&s;s it did
then appear &s;o to me. I had not at fir&s;t
weighed all the con&s;equences of my enter|prize
with that deliberation that I ought.
The principal object I had in view, was the
&s;eparating Mrs. Gerrarde and Mr. Arnold,
and rai&s;ing his indignation again&s;t her, on
account of the apparent infidelity on her
&s;ide. To &s;ay the truth, I had not con&s;ider|ed
what I was to do with her when I had her.
Two things I had re&s;olved on; the one was,
not to let her return to England; the other,
to provide for her in whatever way &s;he
would put it in my power (the devoting
my&s;elf to her excepted), in &s;uch a man|ner
as &s;hould leave$ her no room to re|proach
me with having injured her temporal
welfare.</P>
<P>During my illne&s;s, I had revolved all
the&s;e things in my mind; the la&s;t, viz. the
providing for Mrs. Gerrarde, was not a
matter in which I expected to meet many
difficulties; the other appeared very formi|dable.
Several methods pre&s;ented them|&s;elves,
but none of them plea&s;ed me, and
I rejected them one after the other; and,
to tell you my mind hone&s;tly, I was almo&s;t
<PB N="336" REF="338">
re&s;olved on u&s;ing compul&s;ion, and frighten|ing
the poor woman into compliance; for I
preferred even this to artificial dealings. I
had already u&s;ed more than I could have
po&s;&s;ibly brought my&s;elf to on any other oc|ca&s;ion
in the world; and I think I &s;hould
have threatened her with a nunnery, the
ba&s;tile, or even an inqui&s;ition, &s;ooner than
have failed, if &s;he her&s;elf had not beyond
expectation, beyond hope, almo&s;t beyond
the evidence of my &s;en&s;es, led me as it were
to reque&s;t the thing of her, which of all
others I mo&s;t de&s;paired of her con&s;enting to,
or even hearing propo&s;ed with patience.
And yet, notwith&s;tanding the &s;eeming
&s;trangene&s;s of this, it was nothing but what
was very natural, and mo&s;t con&s;onant to her
own de&s;igns. Blinded, and, as I may &s;ay,
infatuated by vanity, &s;he imagined, that as
I had taken &s;uch uncommon pains to obtain
her, I mu&s;t love her with an uncommon
degree of pa&s;&s;ion; and that her &s;teadily
refu&s;ing any di&s;honourable propo&s;als might
induce me, rather than lo&s;e her, to make her
my wife.</P>
<P>In order to prepare me the better for this,
no means were more natural, than for her
to a&s;&s;ume the air of a penitent, to &s;eem
&s;orry and a&s;hamed of her pa&s;t &s;ins, and re|&s;olve
on a virtuous cour&s;e for the future. At
the wor&s;t, that is, if &s;he found <HI>I</HI> was not
di&s;po&s;ed to be as virtuous as her&s;elf, &s;he
<PB N="337" REF="339">
knew &s;he might play an after-game; and
could ea&s;ily relax by degrees from the &s;e|verity
of her cha&s;tity, accordingly as I
made it worth her while.</P>
<P>This was the ma&s;ter-key to her behaviour,
and once I had got it, which I &s;oon did, it
was ea&s;y to unlock her brea&s;t.</P>
<P>She came into my room the next morn|ing
without an invitation, and only the pre|vious
ceremony of &s;ending Rachael to en|quire
how I did, and to tell me, if I were
well enough to <HI>ri&s;e</HI> (ob&s;erve her nicety), &s;he
would &s;it half an hour with me. I had en|joyed
&s;uch tranquility of heart &s;ince my la&s;t
conference with her, and had re&s;ted &s;o well
the preceding night, that I found my&s;elf
quite another thing from what I was the day
before; and, excepting a little weakne&s;s, I
was as well as ever I was in my life. I was up
and dre&s;&s;ed, and you may be &s;ure &s;ent a
&s;uitable an&s;wer to her kind me&s;&s;age, which
&s;oon brought the lady, &s;ailing with an im|perial
port, into my chamber. After &s;ome
civilities pa&s;t on both &s;ides, &s;he, by way of
bringing her own intere&s;ts on the tapis, re|a&s;&s;umed
the topic of our ye&s;terday's con|ver&s;ation.</P>
<P>You don't imagine Mr. Faulkland, &s;aid
&s;he, how ea&s;y I am in my mind, &s;ince I
have reconciled my&s;elf to the lo&s;s of Mr.
Arnold. I own I had a regard for him;
but I think it had more of gratitude than
<PB N="338" REF="340">
love in it; for though he is an agreeable
man, to &s;ay the truth, he never was quite
to my ta&s;te: he had always &s;omething too
formal about him.</P>
<P>I took the liberty to a&s;k her, how &s;he
fir&s;t came acquainted with Mr. Arnold;
and, as you may not know it, I will give you
the &s;tory. She an&s;wered, with a profound
&s;igh, It was by mere accident I fir&s;t &s;aw
him. After the death of Captain Gerrarde,
which happened in a little more than a year
after we left Bath, for the gout, poor man,
got into his &s;tomach not long after we re|turned
home (and the crocodile pretended
to drop a tear), I went to London, in or|der
to &s;ollicit for my pen&s;ion. As I had
formerly been a Roman Catholic, and had
not publickly renounced that per&s;ua&s;ion, &s;ome
difficulties aro&s;e in the bu&s;ine&s;s; and a friend
of my decea&s;ed hu&s;band, who had under|taken
the affair for me, happening to be
an intimate of Mr. Arnold's, and knowing
he had an influence with the &s;ecretary at war,
endeavoured to intere&s;t him in my favour,
by repre&s;enting my &s;ituation in the mo&s;t af|fecting
light he could to him. He kindly
undertook to interfere for me, and was as
good as his word; but could not &s;urmount
the difficulty of the objection which was
made to my claim. He happened one
morning, unluckily for me, to call in
at my friend's lodgings, to tell him of
<PB N="339" REF="341">
his ill &s;ucce&s;s: I, impatient to know how
my affair went on, had dropped in to en|quire
about it a few minutes before him,
and was &s;itting in the dining-room when
Mr. Arnold entered. I was in my weeds,
and my melancholy looks, I believe, made
Mr. Arnold conjecture I was the per&s;on for
whom he had &s;o kindly concerned him&s;elf.
He told my friend he was &s;orry to inform
him, that though he had u&s;ed all means in
his power, with regard to the affair in which
he had employed him, he found it was im|po&s;&s;ible
to effect the bu&s;ine&s;s; and I am the
more concerned, &s;aid he, turning towards me,
as I am afraid this lady is to be the &s;ufferer.
My relation &s;aid I was the per&s;on for whom
he had been &s;o good as to intercede. I re|turned
Mr. Arnold thanks not without
tears at the uncomfortable pro&s;pect I had
before me; for I had then nothing to depend
on but my &s;mall jointure in Kent. I was
about to take my leave; but ob&s;erving it
rained, de&s;ired my friend to give his &s;ervant
leave to call me a chair. Mr. Arnold very
politely de&s;ired I would permit him to &s;et
me down, as his chariot waited at the door.
I would have excu&s;ed my&s;elf; but my
relation &s;aid, 'Tis in his way, child; and
&s;ince you have no hopes of a pen&s;ion, you
ought to be &s;paring of chair-hire. Mr.
Arnold very obligingly offered me his hand,
and led me to his chariot. He &s;et me down
<PB N="340" REF="342">
at my lodgings, and at parting de&s;ired per|mi&s;&s;ion
to wait on me. The fatal con&s;e|quence
of our acquaintance it was impo&s;|&s;ible
for me to fore&s;ee; for I never had the
lea&s;t hint given me, either from my own
relation or Mr. Arnold him&s;elf, that he was
a married man, 'till he had &s;o far &s;ecured my
gratitude, by repeated acts of genero&s;ity,
that it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to refu&s;e him
the return he demanded.</P>
<P>Too-grateful heart, &s;aid I (pretending to
believe her cant,) what a pity thou wert not
de&s;tined to reward a purer love! But I thought,
madam, you really had enjoyed a pen&s;ion.</P>
<P>It was not nece&s;&s;ary, &s;he an&s;wered, that I
&s;hould let the world &s;uppo&s;e otherwi&s;e. I was
not at all known when I fir&s;t came to town.
Mr. Arnold's exce&s;&s;ive profu&s;ene&s;s (quite
again&s;t my inclination), threw me into a
more expen&s;ive way of living than before.
I found my&s;elf obliged to account for it,
to the few acquaintance I had, by all the
probable means I could devi&s;e. For this
purpo&s;e, I pretended that I had not only
obtained a pen&s;ion, but had al&s;o a fortune
left me by the death of a relation. This was
believed, as no-body troubled their heads to
enquire whether it was true or not.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnold was pa&s;&s;ionately fond of the
country, and always pa&s;&s;ed his &s;ummers
there; but as he could not think of parting
<PB N="341" REF="343">
with me, he was &s;adly at a lo&s;s how to have
me near him, without bringing on us both
the ob&s;ervation of an inqui&s;itive neghbour|hood
(&s;uch as all country places abound in)
if I went down, quite a &s;tranger as I was,
into E&s;&s;ex; particularly as he told me there
were two families near Arnold-abbey, who
made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to pry into other peo|ple's
affairs. The&s;e were, a Lady Grim&s;ton, a
cen&s;orious old woman, and the par&s;on of the
pari&s;h, who was a mighty &s;trict man, of
whom Mr. Arnold &s;eemed to &s;tand in &s;ome
awe. He therefore determined again&s;t my
going into that part of the world: but hav|ing
ca&s;ually heard me &s;peak of my little cot|tage
in Kent, where poor Captain Gerrarde
and I had lived for two or three years, he
a&s;ked me whereabouts it was, and was delight|ed
to find it joined his own e&s;tate at South-Park,
and was within a mile of his hou&s;e.
He begged of me to go down to my own
hou&s;e, which he in&s;i&s;ted on furni&s;hing ele|gantly
for me, and obliged me al&s;o to keep
a chariot. I (tho' unwillingly) found my&s;elf
under a nece&s;&s;ity of complying. About a
fortnight after I was &s;ettled at A&s;hby, Mr.
Arnold and his family came down: then it
was, for the fir&s;t time, I &s;aw his lady.
I went to pay my compliments to her, as eve|ry
genteel family in the neighbourhood did;
and I own I never &s;aw her without &s;eeling
my&s;elf &s;hocked to death at the thoughts of
<PB N="342" REF="344">
the injury I did her; for I really believe
Mrs. Arnold is a very well meaning woman.</P>
<P>Oh! thou &s;corpion, muttered I to my&s;elf,
and yet thou ha&s;t pur&s;ued her to affliction
and ruin!</P>
<P>That Mrs. Arnold is a well-meaning wo|man,
&s;aid I coldly, I have no doubt; yet
you &s;ee Mr. Arnold's opinion of her virtue
was not &s;trong enough to be proof again&s;t
&s;u&s;picions; for it is mo&s;t certain, that if he
had not given credit to your repre&s;entations of
his wife's conduct, he would not have gone
&s;uch lengths as to have parted with her, for Ar|nold:
had always &s;ome regard to appearances.</P>
<P><HI>My</HI> repre&s;entations, Sir! with a look of
a&s;toni&s;hment; pray do not lay more to my
charge than I de&s;erve: what the particular
rea&s;ons were, which induced Mr. Arnold to
part with his wife, I will not &s;ay; but what|ever
his &s;u&s;picions were, they never took
their ri&s;e from me.</P>
<P>I found &s;he intended to brazen this denial
out; but as it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to
my de&s;ign to bring her to a confe&s;&s;ion of
this particular act of per&s;idy, I re&s;olved to
lead her into it in &s;uch a way as &s;hould be
lea&s;t mortifying to her pride.</P>
<P>Come, come, my dear Mrs. Gerrarde,
&s;aid I, I know you are above concealing any
pa&s;t failings that you are re&s;olved to mend.
I know very well that it was <HI>your</HI> in&s;inuati|ons,
and your's only, that kindled the fire of
<PB N="343" REF="345">
jealou&s;y in Arnold's brea&s;t. Such arts are not
uncommon in lovers. You loved him then,
and wi&s;hed to have him entirely to your&s;elf;
and a wife, though a for&s;aken one, is &s;till
intitled to &s;o much attention from her hu&s;|band,
as a fond mi&s;tre&s;s may think robs her
of too much. I know this was the ca&s;e,
and it is natural: but were you not on unmer|ciful
little tyrant to involve <HI>me</HI> in the mi&s;|chief,
and put it into the man's noddle,
that <HI>I</HI> had de&s;igns upon his wife?</P>
<P>The ea&s;y manner in which I affected to
&s;peak of this affair, &s;eemed to reconcile her
a little to the charge; but the la&s;t part of it,
which regarded my&s;elf, &s;truck her all of a
heap. She had no notion that I knew it.
She was going to &s;peak, to deny the accu&s;a|tion,
I &s;uppo&s;e, and therefore I prevented her;
and taking her by the hand, Come now,
&s;aid I, deal with me ingenuou&s;ly; and if
you would per&s;uade me that you are really
in earne&s;t, and mean to repair tho&s;e little
lap&s;es which you have incon&s;iderately been
led into, tell me truly, did you really believe
that I ever had any thoughts of an amour
with Mrs. Arnold.</P>
<P>I cho&s;e to give my enquiry this turn, that
&s;he might, with le&s;s &s;hame to her&s;elf, by
laying hold on the hint, acknowledge her
guilt. She he&s;itated for an an&s;wer, and I
gue&s;&s;ed &s;he was con&s;idering whether to per|&s;i&s;t
in denying the whole charge again&s;t her,
<PB N="344" REF="346">
or avail her&s;elf of the handle I had given
her, and make a &s;ort of merit of her &s;incerity,
by pretending to believe what &s;he was
thoroughly convinced there was not the lea&s;t
foundation even to &s;u&s;pect, but what her
own wicked &s;ugge&s;tions had encouraged in
the unfortunate Arnold. Her &s;ilence, thus
rightly interpreted by me, made me go on:
You &s;ee I know all your &s;ecrets; and you are
not the woman I take you for, if you con|ceal
your real &s;entiments in this particular:
more of my quiet depends on it than you
are aware of, and I withdrew my hand from
her's with a &s;erious and almo&s;t re&s;enting air.</P>
<P>She appeared di&s;turbed, and in a good
deal of confu&s;ion; but recovering her&s;elf,
Why really, Mr. Faulkland, I can't &s;ay but
I <HI>had</HI> &s;ome &s;u&s;picion of what you mention.
I was no &s;tranger to your fondne&s;s for Mrs.
Arnold before &s;he was married, and there
was nothing very &s;urpri&s;ing in a di&s;appointed
lover's renewing his hopes, when he thought
the neglect which a lady met with from her
hu&s;band, might incline her to be le&s;s obdurate
to a man &s;he was once known to favour &s;o much.</P>
<P>This was enough: I did not think it by
any means nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;s her to a farther
explanation; what &s;he &s;aid was a &s;ufficient
acknowledgement of her fault, though the
cunning forcere&s;s had turned the hint (which
I had indeed thrown out on purpo&s;e) to her
own advantage: and had the effrontery to
<PB N="345" REF="347">
avow an opinion which had never before
entered into her imagination.</P>
<P>I found it nece&s;&s;ary now to carry on the
farce, by a&s;&s;uring her, I had never enter|tained
a thought to Mrs. Arnold's di&s;ho|nour;
and that though I made no great
&s;cruple of robbing a man of his mi&s;tre&s;s,
yet I thought it a crime of the blacke&s;t dye
to deprive him of the affection or fidelity
of his wife.</P>
<P>The &s;erious manner in which I &s;poke this,
a little di&s;concerted Mrs. Gerrarde. Well
&s;aid &s;he, I can only &s;ay, that I am very &s;orry I
entertained &s;o fal&s;e a &s;u&s;picion; and more &s;o, as
it has produced &s;uch unhappy con&s;equences:
but I hope Mr. Faulkland will not believe
that I meant <HI>him</HI> any injury.</P>
<P>That I am &s;ure you did not, &s;aid I; and yet
this very affair has given me more unea&s;ine&s;s
than you can imagine; for as Mrs. Arnold's
brother is my mo&s;t particular friend, he
mu&s;t think me the greate&s;t of villains, if
I could entertain a thought of di&s;honouring
his family: the fear of lo&s;ing his friend&s;hip,
I own, gives me more pain than I can ex|pre&s;s,
and there is nothing I would not do
to exculpate my&s;elf to him.</P>
<P>I am very unfortunate, cried Mrs. Ger|rarde
(pretending to wipe her eyes), to have
been the occa&s;ion of &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s in any|body's
family. I wi&s;h I had died before I
was &s;o unhappy as to meet with Mr. Ar|nold,
<PB N="346" REF="348">
if it had not been for him, I might
now have been an innocent and a contented
woman; and &s;he <HI>really</HI> &s;queezed out a tear,
though not of contrition.</P>
<P>Dear madam (again taking her hand), do
not afflict your&s;elf for what is pa&s;t recalling;
contentment, nay happine&s;s, I hope, is
yet within your reach; it will be your own
fault if you do not lay hold of it: as for
the unhappy family that <HI>I,</HI> as well as <HI>you,</HI>
have contributed to di&s;tre&s;s, I wi&s;h from my
heart there could be a re-union among&s;t
them. Mr. Arnold's having lo&s;t you
might perhaps incline him to turn his
thoughts towards his wife, if he were not
prejudiced again&s;t her by the &s;u&s;picions he has
entertained of her virtue. This I am afraid
will be an in&s;uperable bar to their ever living
together, unle&s;s your influence, which fir&s;t
gave birth to his jealou&s;y, is &s;till forcible
enough to remove it.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h it were in my power, &s;aid Mrs.
Gerrarde; there is nothing I would not do
to effect it: but what influence can I have
on Mr. Arnold, after what has happened?</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e you were to write to him, &s;aid I:
you and he probably may never meet again;
and it would be an effort worthy indeed of a
noble mind, to repair the wrongs we have
done to others, by a candid acknowledge|ment
of our own faults. Putting Mrs. Ar|nold
out of the que&s;tion, 'tis a reparation
<PB N="347" REF="349">
you owe <HI>my</HI> character; for however light
the world may make of a piece of gallantry
with a married woman, it is a matter of &s;e|rious
moment to me to acquit my&s;elf of the
&s;uppo&s;ed crime to Sir George Bidulph.</P>
<P>If you think, &s;aid &s;he, that my writing to
Mr. Arnold could produce &s;uch good effects,
I am ready to do it; though I confe&s;s I
hardly know how to addre&s;s him; for he
mu&s;t, to be &s;ure, look upon me as the very
rever&s;e of what I <HI>really</HI> am, and thinks me
without di&s;pute an ungrateful woman.</P>
<P>We can but try, &s;aid I: if it does not
produce the de&s;ired effect, it will not be your
fault; and you will have the &s;atisfaction to
reflect that you have done your duty. I
&s;tepped to my e&s;crutoire while I was &s;peak|ing;
and re&s;olving not to give her time to
cool, took out pen, ink, and paper, and
laid them on a little writing-table before her.
If this unlucky breach, &s;aid I, were once
made up, my mind would then be ea&s;y.</P>
<P>She took the pen in her hand, but &s;eemed
irre&s;olute, and at a lo&s;s how to begin. Come,
madam, &s;aid I, and confute by your own
example, the received erroneous opinion,
that if a woman once &s;trays from the paths
of virtue, &s;he never returns to them.</P>
<P>A fal&s;e and ill grounded opinion indeed,
&s;aid &s;he, li&s;ting up her profane eyes as in
penitence. What am I to &s;ay?</P>
<P>[You are to ob&s;erve, that my notes, as
<PB N="348" REF="350">
&s;he went along while I dictated, are put be|tween
hooks.]</P>
<P>[Begin] &lsquo;Dear Sir&rsquo; [for I would be nei|ther
too familiar nor too cold], &startq;The terms
on which you and I have lived, intitle you
to an explanation of my rea&s;ons for leaving
you &s;o abruptly; and I hope the genero&s;ity
of my motive, will incline you to over|look
the &s;eeming unkindne&s;s of the action.&endq;
[This you may a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf it will, when
he comes to con&s;ider coolly]. &startq;The unhap|pine&s;s
that I occa&s;ioned in your family, by
cau&s;ing the &s;eparation of you and your
wife, has, for a long time, been a thorn in
my heart; and the more &s;o, as be&s;ides the
robbing her of your affections, I own,
and take &s;hame to my&s;elf in the confe&s;&s;ion&endq;
[how noble mu&s;t he think this confe&s;&s;ion!],
&startq;that tho&s;e a&s;per&s;ions, which I threw on her,
had not the lea&s;t foundation in truth.&endq;
[This is truly great]. &startq;I always believed
her perfectly innocent; but if I could have
had the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible doubt of it before, I
mu&s;t be now confirmed in that opinion by
Mr. Faulkland, who can have no rea&s;on
for excu&s;ing or concealing facts of this na|ture
from me at pre&s;ent&endq;. [Here &s;he add|ed
of her&s;elf, repeating it fir&s;t aloud to to
me.] &startq;and I think the preference he has
given me to her, now in her &s;tate of &s;e|paration,
is a convincing proof of this.&endq;
[An admirable argument] (her vanity would
<PB N="349" REF="351">
not let her &s;lip this ob&s;ervation). [Pro|ceed
madam]. &lsquo;The true rea&s;ons of my
in&s;inuations again&s;t her, were no other than
that I could not bear to &s;hare your affecti|ons
with any-body&endq; [and a very &s;ufficient
rea&s;on too, which a man that loves can ea&s;ily
forgive]. &startq;I knew, that &s;o long as &s;he gave
you no cau&s;e of complaint, you were too
ju&s;t to withdraw your whole heart from
her, and nothing <HI>but</HI> the whole would con|tent
me.&endq; [Still you &s;ee you &s;hew a great
mind]. True, &s;aid &s;he, going on; but my
rea&s;on for leaving him without apprizing him
of it, what are we to &s;ay for that? [Oh! no|thing
more <HI>ea&s;y</HI> to execute: he will admire
you the more for the rea&s;on <HI>I</HI> &s;hall give.
Come]. &lsquo;My departing without fir&s;t make|ing
you acquainted with my de&s;ign, and
going off with another per&s;on, may, at
fir&s;t &s;ight, &s;eem very &s;trange; but, to tell
you the real &s;tate of my heart, I found I
could not tru&s;t to its firmne&s;s on the &s;ub|ject
of parting with you. I loved you &s;o,
that it was with pain and grief I made the
re&s;olution; and I knew too well, that had
you u&s;ed any arguments, which to be &s;ure
you would have done, to di&s;&s;uade me, I,
like an ea&s;y fool, would have given up all
my good de&s;igns.&rsquo; [I am only afraid this
will make him love you more than ever.]
(She &s;miled as &s;he continued to write.) &startq;As
for the other article&endq;&mdash;(This I was more
<PB N="350" REF="352">
puzzled to excu&s;e than the fir&s;t; but put|ting
on a bold face, I &s;aid, madam, I hope
you will not condemn me here, while you
excu&s;e your&s;elf: the &s;aying you were <HI>run
away</HI> with, will knock all the re&s;t on the
head, and he may chu&s;e whether he will be|lieve
that you really intended to break off
with him or not; therefore that particular had
better not be touched upon. Well, &s;aid &s;he,
get me out of this &s;crape as cleverly as you
brought me into it. Fear not &s;aid I; (go
on). &startq;As for the other article, though I
&s;hall never love Mr. Faulkland as I have
done you, yet in him I have found a pro|tector;
and through his means, I hope to
pa&s;s the remainder of my life, in a manner
more &s;uitable to a woman of a generous
way of thinking, than that wherein &s;he
con&s;idered her&s;elf as encroaching on the
rights of another. I hope, by this &s;acri|fice
which I have made of my love to a
more heroic principle, that I &s;hall expiate
my former offence; and that you will fol|low
my example &s;o far as to make what
reparation you can to the woman we have
both injured.&endq; [How this mu&s;t rai&s;e, how
exalt you in his opinion! I think it mu&s;t,
cried &s;he, bridling up her head, as if they
were really her own &s;entiments.]</P>
<P>I believe, &s;aid I, this is all that is nece&s;|&s;ary
to be &s;aid: you may add, in a po&s;t|&s;cript,
that, as he furni&s;hed the hou&s;e for
<PB N="351" REF="353">
you at A&s;hby, every thing in it is at his &s;er|vice;
together with your chariot and hor&s;es,
which were al&s;o his gifts.</P>
<P>She demurred to this; and in the mid&s;t
of her heroics, &s;aid, I wi&s;h I could get
&s;omebody to fell them for me privately, and
remit the money to me; for, &s;ince I <HI>am</HI>
here, I &s;hould like to &s;ee a little more of
France, before I return.</P>
<P>I told her that would look mean, and be|low
a <HI>great mind.</HI> Well, &s;aid &s;he, let them go.
I owe all my &s;ervants a year's wages, and ano|ther
per&s;on about fifty pounds for a little tem|ple
he had ju&s;t built in my garden, but not
quite fini&s;hed when I came away. I think I
had better de&s;ire tho&s;e debts to be di&s;charged:
I have always been very punctual in my deal|ings,
and would not for the world <HI>wrong</HI>
any-body.</P>
<P>You are in the right, &s;aid I: it will look
honourable in you to de&s;ire tho&s;e debts to be
paid.</P>
<P>She now proceeded to conclude her letter
in the &s;ame &s;tile &s;he had begun it, and added
a po&s;t&s;cript to the purport I mentioned. I
ha&s;tened to make her &s;eal it up, and direct it
to Mr. Arnold at his hou&s;e in London, who,
I &s;uppo&s;e, has had the plea&s;ure of receiving it
before now; for I di&s;patched it off directly.
I flatter my&s;elf with the hope that it will
have the de&s;ired effect on him.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="354">
You will think perhaps, that, as I have
managed it, I have really given her a &s;ort of
merit with him in the acknowedgement of
her fault, and the pretended rea&s;on &s;he gives
for leaving him. No &s;uch thing, Sir George.
Arnold is a man of too much &s;en&s;e, and
knows the world too well, to be &s;o deceived.
I have been told by my lord V&mdash;, who
knows him perfectly, that no-body judges
better when he is not blinded by his pa&s;&s;ions.
All her profe&s;&s;ions mu&s;t go for nothing when
<HI>facts</HI> are again&s;t her. It is plain &s;he went
off with another man, and to all appear|ances
premeditately, as her maid and her
riches bore her company. 'Tis al&s;o plain,
by her own confe&s;&s;ion, that this man &s;tands
well with her. As for her recanting her inju|rious
a&s;per&s;ions on poor Mrs. Arnold, 'tis
the only circum&s;tances in her letter likely to
gain belief, as &s;he could have no temptation
to that but real compunction, with which
people of that kind are &s;ometimes vi&s;ited;
and for the re&s;t of her letter, to any one of
common under&s;tanding, that lays circum|&s;tances
together, it will appear, as I intended
it &s;hould, the contrivance of an artful jilt,
who having almo&s;t ruined the wretch &s;he has
had in her power, would afterwards make a
<HI>merit</HI> of de&s;erting him; for they mu&s;t be
hardened reprobates indeed, that would not,
if they could, at lea&s;t try to palliate their evil
deeds. This is the light I expect Arnold will
<PB N="353" REF="355">
con&s;ider her in. I know he is hurt deeply in
his fortune by this vile harpy. I hope the
remnant may be &s;ufficient to &s;upport your ex|cellent
&s;i&s;ter, if not in affluence, at lea&s;t with
comfort, &s;hould &s;he regain her influence
over him, and &s;ubmit to live with him again.</P>
<P>This I am &s;ure, will be the con&s;equence, if
he is not blind to his own happine&s;s.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be impatient to know how the letter
operates on him; but this you are not likely
to $oe let into; and perhaps his pride may
make him endeavour to conceal it from eve|ry-body.
My lord V&mdash;, I am &s;ure, will pick
up &s;ome intelligence, and &s;end it to me.</P>
<P>I think Mrs. Gerrarde's confe&s;&s;ion, in re|gard
to Mrs. Arnold (to which &s;he could have
no intere&s;ted motive), with the corroborating
circum&s;tance of <HI>my</HI> going off with her at a
time when Mrs. Arnold was from under her
hu&s;band's protection, injured by him in the
tendere&s;t point, and a&s;per&s;ed by a barbarous
and invidious world; all this, I &s;ay, mu&s;t
&s;urely clear from all &s;u&s;picion that admirable
creature: for who, that knows Mrs. Arnold,
would think that any man (except her hu&s;|band)
would prefer any woman upon earth to
her? If this does not remove all doubt of
her conduct in Arnold, as well as in the re&s;t
of the world, my pains have been to little
purpo&s;e; and I know no other human means
that can be u&s;ed to di&s;abu&s;e the mad cre|dulity
of that man. I pity him from my
<PB N="354" REF="356">
heart in his pre&s;ent &s;ituation; for it will be
&s;ome time before he will be &s;en&s;ible of the
good I have done him; and I dare &s;wear, the
man is at this time &s;o ungrateful, that, if he
could, he would cut my throat. I do not
want to have him know the extent of his obli|gation
to me: I &s;hall be &s;atisfied to &s;it down
in the contemplation of my meritorious
actions, without enjoying the &s;ame of them.
This greatne&s;s of mind I learnt of Mrs. Ger|rarde.
But to return:</P>
<P>The having gained my material point
put me into &s;uch &s;pirits, that I could have
ki&s;&s;ed Mrs. Gerrarde; a liberty which, I a&s;|&s;ure
you, however I never pre&s;umed to take.
She, for her part, &s;eemed as well plea&s;ed
with what &s;he had done as I was. I prai&s;ed
her for the part &s;he had acted, though I
very much feared &s;he would repent of it
when we came to explanations, which I re|&s;olved
&s;hould be on that very day. I told
her, I hoped &s;he would oblige me with her
company at dinner. She con&s;ented with a
bow. I had ordered one to be got ready ear|lier
than u&s;ual, and directed that it &s;hould be
in her apartment. We were told it was on
table. I never &s;aw Mrs. Gerrarde &s;o agree|able
as &s;he was during dinner; &s;he was in
high &s;pirits and good humour: I almo&s;t
thought it a pity to let her down that day;
but I con&s;idered the longer her expectations
were kept up, the greater would be her di&s;|appointment;
<PB N="355" REF="357">
and out of pure charity, I
determined to put her out of doubt.</P>
<P>I had been told Mrs. Gerrarde was no
enemy to a chearful gla&s;s; but the de&s;igns
&s;he had formed upon me put her on her
guard, and I ob&s;erved &s;he drank nothing but
wine and water, made very &s;mall. This, I
was afraid, would not be &s;ufficient to keep
up her courage under what I intended to
&s;ay to her. I pretended to be di&s;po&s;ed to
drink, and in&s;i&s;ted on her helping me out
with a fla&s;k of burgundy. With affected
coyne&s;s &s;he &s;uffered me to fill her gla&s;s; the
&s;econd offer I made, her re&s;i&s;tance was le&s;s;
the third &s;he made no objection to at all; and
the fourth &s;he filled for her&s;elf. The wine
was excellent; not that poor &s;ort which is
commonly drunk in France. In &s;hort, we fi|ni&s;hed
our bottle. I thought her now a
match for what I had to &s;ay. I had made
the gla&s;s pa&s;s bri&s;kly, and had filled up the
intervals with &s;inging catches, and rattling
on any &s;ubject that came into my head.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gerrarde, who no doubt expected I
&s;hould make an advance of &s;ome kind or
other, &s;eemed to grow a little out of humour
at my levity. I found the burgundy had
been quite thrown away upon her, and had
had very little effect: &s;he was &s;ilent for a few
minutes, and &s;eemed to be con&s;idering of
&s;omething: at la&s;t &s;he opened, and I will
<PB N="356" REF="358">
give you the conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed between
us, by way of dialogue.</P>
</LETTER>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Faulkland, it is time that
you and I &s;hould under&s;tand one another's
meaning a little better than we do at pre|&s;ent:
you know very well that you have put
an end to all my expectations in England:
indeed, if I were at liberty, I could not have
the face to return there again in any charac|ter
but that of your wife. (I was glad &s;he
began fir&s;t, and that, though I gue&s;&s;ed at her
views &s;he had u&s;ed &s;o little caution in di&s;co|vering

which I could not &s;uppre&s;s, and

<P>My <HI>wife,</HI> madam! (&s;topping her

me if I heard you right?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, it was your wife I &s;aid:
if you think you and I are to live together
on any other terms, you will find your&s;elf ex|ceedingly
mi&s;taken. (I &s;miled and &s;uffered
her to go on). I thought, Sir (&s;tifling the
anger that I &s;aw ri&s;ing), that the words which
you your&s;elf dictated in the letter which I
ju&s;t now wrote, where you &s;ay, <HI>I had in you
found a protector, and by who&s;e means I &s;hould
be able to pa&s;s the re&s;t of my life in a manner
more &s;uitable to a woman of a generous way of
thinking, than that wherein &s;he con&s;idered her|&s;elf
<PB N="357" REF="359">
as incroaching on the rights of another</HI>&mdash;
Were not the&s;e your own words, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>They were, madam. (To &s;ay the
truth), there was &s;omething equivocal in the
paragraph, tho', when I de&s;ired her to write
it, this con&s;truction never entered into my
head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Sir, how am I to under|&s;tand
them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I prote&s;t, madam, you have forced
a con&s;truction that I never once &s;o much as
dreamed of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Mr. Faulkland (with a very
bri&s;k tone), do you fancy that by changing
Mr. Arnold for <HI>you</HI> on any other conditions,
that I am &s;uch a mighty gainer by the bar|gain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really, madam, if that <HI>were</HI>
to be the ca&s;e, I don't think you would be a
very great lo&s;er: you have got as much
from poor Arnold as you could expect: I am
able to do better for you; and as I am no|body's
property, it would certainly, in <HI>that</HI>
re&s;pect, be rather a more eligible cour&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you u&s;e me very ill! I did
not expect &s;uch treatment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, pray, madam? Did I ever
&s;ay I would marry you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir; but your behaviour
has given me room to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;uch a
thing was in your thoughts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you not then the more
<PB N="358" REF="360">
obliged to me for treating you with &s;uch re|&s;pect
as made you fancy &s;o?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Re&s;pect! re&s;pect (muttering be|tween
her teeth), Mr. Faulkland! (and &s;he
&s;tood up) there is not a man in England but
your&s;elf, after what I have declared, that
would refu&s;e making me his wife.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>What have you declared, Mrs.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, have I not ingenuou&s;ly
owned my failings, &s;hewed my&s;elf &s;orry for
them, quitted them, and made all the repa|ration
in my power?</P>
<P>(I was amazed to &s;ee how audaciou&s;ly &s;he

had &s;ugge&s;ted to her: it was &s;o like her, that
I could have laughed in her face).</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your behaviour on this occa&s;ion,
has really been worthy of the imitation of all
your own &s;ex, and the prai&s;e of ours: for a
woman <HI>voluntarily</HI> to quit an irregular life,
and that too from mere motives of <HI>con&s;cience</HI>&mdash;
(I was &s;topped by a knavi&s;h &s;neer, which I
could not &s;ubdue. She &s;aw it and fired imme|diately;
but &s;trutted about the room to cool

<P>Very well, Sir; very well; I am

<P>We were both &s;ilent. She, I &s;uppo&s;e, ex|pected

<P>Did I ever pre&s;ume, on the ad|vantage

<SP>

<P>I do not &s;ay you did; and it was

<SP>

<P>You drew a wrong conclu&s;ion,

<SPEAKER>M. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, the point, in &s;hort, is this;

<P>I followed her; and taking her by the

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, Sir; I am your pri|&s;oner;
your <HI>&s;lave</HI> at pre&s;ent: &s;ay what you
plea&s;e; 'tis <HI>your</HI> turn <HI>now.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, Madam, as I &s;aid be|fore,
I really never had any de&s;igns upon you
<PB N="362" REF="364">
merely on your own account. I allow you
to be a very fine woman, and capable of in|&s;piring
love in any man that &s;ees you; but I
mu&s;t tell you plainly, that <HI>love</HI> has had no
&s;hare in my conduct. (I &s;aw &s;tifled rage in
her face; but I proceeded). I have already
told you the real motive of my carrying you
off: it was, as I &s;aid, to di&s;&s;olve the union
between you and Mr. Arnold, and my rea|&s;ons
for wi&s;hing to do &s;o are the&s;e: Mr.
Arnold is married to one of the be&s;t women
living, for whom I have the highe&s;t re&s;pect
and e&s;teem, and whom I once adored: That
lady has, by your influence over her hu&s;band,
not only been thrown out from his heart,
but even thru&s;t out from his hou&s;e. But
the calamity &s;tops not there; &s;he is cruelly
a&s;per&s;ed by the world through your &s;ugge&s;ti|ons,
and I am the per&s;on pointed at for the
injurer of Mr. Arnold's honour, and the de|&s;troyer
of his wife's innocence. You have
brought &s;hame and grief into a worthy fami|ly.
Lady Bidulph (an excellent woman) has
not been able to overcome the &s;hock of the
barbarous treatment her daughter has met
with. Her brother, the beloved friend of
my heart, &s;uffers equal di&s;tre&s;s; for, though
he is con&s;cious of his &s;i&s;ter's innocence, he
feels the wounds that her reputation has re|ceived;
nor can he po&s;&s;ibly redre&s;s the mi&s;|chief,
as his &s;i&s;ter's injuries &s;pring from a
cau&s;e which her delicacy will not permit to
<PB N="363" REF="365">
be &s;crutinized. Her two poor children are
left without a mother; &s;he her&s;elf almo&s;t
without a friend and &s;inking every day under
the weight of &s;uch complicated mi&s;ery. As
for Mr. Arnold him&s;elf, I profe&s;s no per&s;onal
regard for him: I &s;carce know him; but,
for his family's &s;ake, I would, on any <HI>other</HI>
occa&s;ion, ri&s;que my life to &s;ave him from
ruin; for ruin you have almo&s;t brought on
him. I am no &s;tranger to the &s;ums he has
lavi&s;hed on you; his purcha&s;ing an employ|ment
for <HI>one</HI> of your brothers, and redeem|ing
another from a pri&s;on. You have lo&s;t
nothing by my proceedings but what I &s;hall
make up ten-fold to you, if you behave &s;o as
to de&s;erve my kindne&s;s. I have now laid
before you the true rea&s;on for my conduct.
I hope, that by breaking the inchantment
that tied Mr. Arnold's heart, and blinded his
under&s;tanding, he may be induced to do
ju&s;tice to his injured lady and her family. If
this comes to pa&s;s, as I have &s;trong rea&s;on
to hope, I have no doubt of the lady's cha|racter
being retrieved. <HI>Groundle&s;s</HI> calum|nies
generally die of them&s;elves, unle&s;s in|du&s;triou&s;ly
kept alive by malice. Mrs. Ar|nold's
blamele&s;s conduct, the friend&s;hip her
brother has all along continued to favour me
with, joined to this la&s;t apparent proof of my
attachment to you, will, I am certain, in the
eyes of the world, acquit her of all &s;u&s;picion
of guilt. Your letter to Mr. Arnold will,
<PB N="364" REF="366">
as far as relates to your own opinion of her,
give unque&s;tionable evidence of her inno|cence.</P>
</SP>
<P>Now, Mrs. Gerrarde, lay your hand on
your heart, and an&s;wer me if I have not given
you rea&s;ons, which, though they may not
be &s;atisfactory to you, are in them&s;elves of
weight &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify my conduct.</P>
<P>I had watched her countenance narrowly
during my di&s;cour&s;e, which &s;he had li&s;tened
to without once looking at me. I &s;aw I had
&s;hocked and even confounded her; but I
&s;aw no remor&s;e, no contrition in her looks.
All artifice was now at an end, and &s;he un|ma&s;ked
the fiend directly. She &s;tarted off her
chair with the looks and ge&s;tures of a fury;
and fixing her eyes (which had really &s;ome|thing
diabolical in them at that in&s;tant)
&s;teadily on me, You wretch! &s;he cried, with
a voice an&s;werable to her looks, you are &s;uch
a fal&s;e di&s;&s;embling, mean-&s;pirited reptile, that
if you had a kingdom to offer me, and
would lay your&s;elf at my feet to beg my ac|ceptance
of you, I would trample on you
like dirt! and &s;he &s;tamped on the floor with
the air of an amazon. Do you think you
&s;hally carry on this fine-contrived enterprize?
No, if I peri&s;h for it, I will have venge|ance:
Mr. Arnold &s;hall know how I have
been deceived and betrayed, and I will at
<PB N="365" REF="367">
lea&s;t have the &s;atisfaction of getting your
life, if I lo&s;e every thing be&s;ides.</P>
<P>A bur&s;t of malignant tears now gu&s;hed
from her eyes; but &s;he robbed them of their
efficacy, by mixing with them the bittere&s;t
imprecations again&s;t me. She cur&s;t even
the innocent Mrs. Arnold, you, and the
whole family; and her own folly, in being
blinded by the arts of &s;uch a worthle&s;s milk|&s;op
as my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I let her give vent to her pa&s;&s;ion, calmly
walking about the room all the time; only
now and then ca&s;ting an eye on her, for
fear &s;he would have ru&s;hed on me with a
pen-knife; for I have not the lea&s;t doubt,
if &s;he had &s;uch an in&s;trument about her, &s;he
would have made an attempt that might
have given a very tragical turn to my ad|ventures.</P>
<P>When &s;he had done &s;obbing, I addre&s;&s;ed
her in a very &s;tern voice; for I found I had
no baby to deal with, and therefore re&s;olved
to frighten her into &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I told you before, Madam, that violence
would be of no u&s;e to you: your menaces
I laugh at; you are in my power intirely,
and ab&s;olutely at my di&s;po&s;al: to think of
getting out of my hands would be vain; for
it is as impracticable as flying. No mortal
knows where you are but the people of this
hou&s;e, who are &s;trangers to your name and
circum&s;tances; and if they knew both, they
<PB N="366" REF="368">
are &s;o totally at my devotion, that it would
not avail you. I &s;hall cut off all po&s;&s;ibility
of a corre&s;pondence to England. What
then mu&s;t be your re&s;ource? I am prepar|ed
again&s;t all events; and I would carry
you about locked up in an iron cage, like
the Turki&s;h tyrant, till I had &s;ubdued that
termagant &s;pirit, &s;ooner than you &s;hould
have your liberty to do more mi&s;chief. If
you have any regard to your own intere&s;t,
you will endeavour to make me your friend:
I have the power and will to &s;erve you; I
have done you no injury; I &s;aid I would be
your protector; and &s;o I will, if you will &s;uf|fer
me to be &s;o. I &s;aid I would be the means
of your pa&s;&s;ing your days in a &s;tate more
eligible to a woman of either &s;pirit, di&s;creti|on,
or a grain of honour, than you have hi|therto
done. This I am ready to make
good, if you will not be wanting on
your part to your own happine&s;s. You have
acknowledged that you are con&s;cious of your
errors, are &s;orry for them, and are willing
to quit them (This was turning her own
weapons again&s;t her&s;elf); if you are in ear|ne&s;t
in this declaration, I will give you the
means of quitting them The money you
have now in your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, even with the
addition of your little jointure, is not &s;ufficient
to promi&s;e you &s;uch a &s;upport as would make
you ea&s;y, if you were to return to England
to-morrow; and your &s;tory known (as it
<PB N="367" REF="369">
would be), what could you expect? Do you
think Arnold could be &s;o be&s;otted as to re|ceive
you again? What mu&s;t be your re|&s;ource?
Why, to continue, while your beau|ty
la&s;ts, in a wretched, abandoned cour&s;e.
Ten thou&s;and to one you might never light
on another who&s;e love would be prodigal
enough to enrich you. The only choice
left you, is to &s;tay where you are not known,
and where, if you behave well, you may gain
the re&s;pect and e&s;teem which you could ne|ver
hope for in a place where your hi&s;tory is
known. If you will content your&s;elf with
an ea&s;y fortune, joined to a life of virtue and
tranquillity, I will provide you with a hu&s;|band
that many a woman in your circum|&s;tances
would ble&s;s her &s;tars for: I will dou|ble
the portion you have already, and get it
&s;ettled on you; and will, on certain conditi|ons,
add a hand&s;ome yearly income. If you
do not like this propo&s;al, I have no other al|ternative
to offer but a nunnery. I know
you were bred a Roman Catholick: I am
&s;ure therefore I &s;hall do no violence to your
religious &s;cruples, if you have any. I can
get you admitted with ea&s;e: the religious
here will think it a meritorious act in me,
e&s;pecially on the terms I &s;hall propo&s;e; for I
will make it worth their while to receive and
treat you as a lady of the fir&s;t family in
France: but remember there is a final period
to all intercour&s;e with this world. If you
<PB N="368" REF="370">
think you can bring your&s;elf to &s;ubmit to
&s;uch a life, I would really recommend it to
you; for I am &s;ollicitous for your happine&s;s
both here and hereafter: if not, you have
the other choice to make; and &s;o, Madam, a
hu&s;band or a convent; take which you like
be&s;t: I give you three days to con&s;ider of
it.</P>
<P>I kept up a &s;evere countenance, and a re|&s;olute
tone. I rang the bell as &s;oon as I had
done &s;peaking. Rachael came in before Mrs.
Gerrarde could an&s;wer me. Take care of
your mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;aid I, and left the room, with|out
even the ceremony of a bow, or deign|ing
to look at her. I locked the chamber
door, which I took care to clap after me;
and, putting the key in my pocket, left the
lady and her maid to con&s;ult at their lei|&s;ure.</P>
<P>You know, Bidulph, I am not naturally
moro&s;e; and that I am not very apt to be
wanting in that complai&s;ance which all wo|men
expect, and which I really think due to
<HI>almo&s;t</HI> all women: but this one had, in the
preceding &s;cene, &s;o intirely thrown off her
&s;ex, that I could hardly con&s;ider her as a fe|male.
I had known many of her ill quali|ties
before; but tho&s;e &s;he now di&s;covered, if
they did not &s;hew her more wicked, certain|ly
rendered her more di&s;gu&s;tful to me than
the others. In &s;hort, I found that all deco|rum
was to be laid a&s;ide: I had gone too far
<PB N="369" REF="371">
not to put the fini&s;hing hand to my work;
and I had no other mea&s;ures to ob&s;erve, but
to fini&s;h, by dint of force, what I had begun
by &s;tratagem. When I mentioned the nun|nery
to you in a former letter, it was in mere
gaiety of heart: I had no &s;erious thoughts of
that kind, nor did I now propo&s;e it as a prac|ticable
&s;cheme. I knew the woman too well
to &s;uppo&s;e &s;he would acquie&s;ce; though, to
confe&s;s the truth to you hone&s;tly, I think, if
&s;he refu&s;es my other plan of accommodation,
I mu&s;t compel her to accept of this: nor
ought it to be con&s;idered in any other light
than that of confining a wild bea&s;t, who,
having already done a great deal of mi&s;chief,
would &s;till do more, if left at liberty: but I
think I &s;hall not be driven to this. I believe
&s;he will accept of a hu&s;band with a good &s;et|tlement,
&s;ooner than re&s;ign her liberty.</P>
<P>And now who do you think the hu&s;band
is whom I have under contemplation for her?
Why, no le&s;s a man than my valet de
chambre Mon&s;ieur Pivet. He is young and
hand&s;ome, of good parts, and a man of birth.
He tells me he has an uncle that is a marquis,
and three or four cou&s;ins that are in the high
court of parliament. Without a joke, the
fellow is of a pretty good family: he was
bred a mercer, and in a frolick had run away
from his bu&s;ine&s;s, when I picked him up at
Paris, at the time you and I were there toge|ther.
He then told me, that he only hired
<PB N="370" REF="372">
with me for an opportunity of &s;eeing a little
of the world, and that he would one time or
other &s;it down and &s;ettle to his trade. I have
&s;ounded him on the point in hand, and find
him very ready to accept of the lady with all
hers faults.</P>
<P>I told you I had introduced him to Mrs.
Gerrarde, to &s;erve as her interpreter in the
hou&s;e, at the time I was ill. I did not then
tell her who he was; and both &s;he and her
maid take him for no other than an acquain|tance
of mine, who happens to lodge in the
&s;ame hou&s;e with us. The vain rogue has en|couraged
this opinion, and I &s;uppo&s;e pa&s;&s;es
for a very pretty fellow with them; for you
know Pivet is a Beau, and is really not un|genteel.
But do not fancy that I intend to
impo&s;e him on the lady for any other than
what he really is. All di&s;gui&s;e is now laid
a&s;ide, and I &s;hall proceed with the utmo&s;t
plainne&s;s and &s;incerity, as &s;oon as I know
the lady's mind in regard to her choice.</P>
<P>Here, my dear Sir George, I mu&s;t take
breath a little: it has been a bu&s;y day. I
undertook a difficult voyage without the cer|tainty
of a landing-place; a few &s;torms I
expected to encounter; I hope I have wea|thered
the wor&s;t, and have come at length
to &s;ome pro&s;pect of an harbour. I expect
my next greeting to you will be from a fair|er
&s;hore.&mdash;Upon &s;econd thoughts, I will
<PB N="371" REF="373">
not &s;end this off, till I can put both you and
my &s;elf out of the reach of &s;u&s;pence.&hellip;</P>
<P>Congratulate me, Sir George, honour me,
as the fir&s;t of politicians, the greate&s;t of ne|gotiators!
let no hero of remance compare
him&s;elf to me, for fir&s;t making difficulties,
and then extricating my&s;elf out of them; let
no giant pretend to equal me in the manage|ment
of captive beauties in inchanted ca&s;tles;
let no necromancer pre&s;ume to vie with me
in &s;kill for metamorpho&s;ing tigre&s;&s;es into
doves, and changing imperious prince&s;&s;es
into plain country nymphs! <HI>All</HI> this have I
brought to pa&s;s, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of en|chanted
&s;word or dwarf, in the compa&s;s of a
few days; but take the circum&s;tances in the
order they occurred.</P>
<P>I left the lady, as I told you, to utter her
complaints to her confidante. Rachael, a
&s;imple girl, who had ju&s;t &s;en&s;e enough to re|gard
her own intere&s;t, was not likely to give
her mi&s;tre&s;s much con&s;olation; for &s;he was
at lea&s;t as much <HI>my</HI> friend as her's. How <HI>they</HI>
pa&s;&s;ed the night I know not; for my own
part, I &s;lept in perfect tranquillity. I de&s;ir|ed
Pivet in the morning to go and inquire,
as from him&s;elf, how the lady re&s;ted. Mrs.
Gerrarde, who was &s;till in bed, no &s;ooner
heard his voice in the outer room, as he was
&s;peaking to her maid, than &s;he called out to
Mon&s;ieur Pivet, and de&s;ired he would be &s;o
good as to &s;tep into her chamber. Pivet, not
<PB N="372" REF="374">
much aba&s;hed at being admitted to a lady's
<HI>ru&egrave;lle,</HI> obeyed her &s;ummons, and placed
him&s;elf in an armed chair by her. He &s;aid
he hoped it was not owing to illne&s;s that he
&s;aw her in bed. Yes, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, I am
exceedingly ill: I have not &s;lept the whole
night, and am now in a high fever. Has Mr.
Faulkland told you any thing in relation to
me? I had prepared Pivet, and he had his
an&s;wers ready. Madam, &s;aid, he, I am not
a &s;tranger to your &s;ituation, and am exceed|ingly
&s;orry for it: I wi&s;h the little influence
<HI>I</HI> have over Mr. Faulkland could be em|ployed
for your &s;ervice; but he is a po&s;itive
man, very enterpri&s;ing, and not to be con|trolled
by any-body. Do you know my &s;to|ry,
Sir, cried Mrs. Gerrarde? He bowed,
and looked down. Mrs. Gerrarde under|&s;tanding
this as an affirmative, and rai&s;ing
her&s;elf up a little, cried out, A ba&s;e, unge|nerous
man! Does he intend to expo&s;e me
wherever he goes? By no means, Madam,
an&s;wered Pivet: There is nothing in your
&s;tory that would do you the lea&s;t injury in
any-body's opinion here: the ladies in France
do not think it any di&s;grace to have lovers.</P>
<P>You are very obliging, Sir, &s;he replied;
and perhaps I have as much to &s;ay in my
vindication as any woman: but &s;ure never
was mortal u&s;ed in the barbarous manner I
am. Do you know the propo&s;al he had the
in&s;olence to make me la&s;t night? Either to
<PB N="373" REF="375">
take a hu&s;band of <HI>his</HI> chu&s;ing (<HI>any</HI> low fel|low,
I &s;uppo&s;e, he thinks good enough for
me) or immediately to go into a nunnery.
Oh! Sir, and &s;he catched hold of his hand,
as you are a gentleman, if you have com|pa&s;&s;ion,
any humanity towards an unfortu|nate
woman, try to deliver me out of his
hands. I have a pretty good &s;um of money
in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; contrive the means of my
e&s;cape; my gratitude to you &s;hall be un|bounded!
and &s;he wrung his hand.</P>
<P>Ah! Madam, &s;aid Pivet, looking tender|ly
at her, I would it were in my power; I
&s;hould think my&s;elf but too happy if it were
po&s;&s;ible for me to accompli&s;h what you re|que&s;t;
but I fear it will be impracticable: I
declare to you, if I were at my own di&s;po|&s;al,
I would fly with you to the remote&s;t
part of the world; but I am a young man,
who have my fortune to make: I am under
particular ties here, and have be&s;ides &s;uch
obligations to Mr. Faulkland, as make it
impo&s;&s;ible for me, con&s;i&s;tently with <HI>honour,</HI>
to interfere in this bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid &s;he eagerly, can't you write a let|ter
for me, or furni&s;h me with the means of
informing my friends in England of my &s;itu|ation?</P>
<P>Madam, &s;aid he, before Mr. Faulkland
permitted me the honour of &s;eeing you, he
engaged my &s;olemn promi&s;e that I would not
intermeddle in your affairs.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="376">
Lord, what will become of me! What
would you, Sir, advi&s;e me to do? For as for
that wretch (meaning me), I am determin|ed,
if I can help it, not to &s;uffer him to
come near me.</P>
<P>'Tis a very nice point, Madam: I really
do not well know how to advi&s;e: but, to be
&s;ure, a nunnery is a choice not to be recom|mended
to a lady of your youth and beauty,
unle&s;s your inclinations lead you that way;
then indeed&mdash;</P>
<P>She interrupted him. Don't name it to
me, Sir; don't name it: I am determined
to keep out of <HI>that</HI> &s;nare, if it be for nothing
but an opportunity to be revenged on that
tyrant: I would marry a beggar &s;ooner than
give up that hope.</P>
<P>As for that, Madam, &s;aid Pivet, I &s;up|po&s;e
Mr. Faulkland would not be &s;o ungene|rous
as to compel you to marry one beneath
you: there are many young men of good
families who would think them&s;elves honour|ed
by your acceptance of them: your per&s;o|nal
accompli&s;hments alone are a &s;ufficient re|commendation;
but Mr. Faulkland menti|ed
to me the additional advantage of fortune.
I dare an&s;wer for him he will not think of be|&s;towing
you unworthily.</P>
<P>I had charged Pivet not to go too far: he
thought it time to break off the conver&s;ation;
and, ri&s;ing up, he told Mrs. Gerrarde he was
going into my apartment, and de&s;ired to
<PB N="375" REF="377">
know if &s;he would honour him with any com|mands.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid &s;he, I &s;hall only beg you will
tell Mr. Faulkland, that I never <HI>can</HI> think of
his propo&s;al; that I am very ill, and beg to
be left in quiet for a few days; but &s;hall be
very glad to &s;ee <HI>you</HI> whenever you are at lei|&s;ure.</P>
<P>He bowed, and left her; then came di|rectly
to me, and repeated the conver&s;ation
he had with her word for word. I am glad,
&s;aid I, to find you are &s;o much in her good
graces: it will accelerate my plot; but we
mu&s;t not make you too cheap: if we manage
di&s;creetly, &s;he may po&s;&s;ibly think her&s;elf ve|ry
well off to get you.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent I &s;tand pretty well with her,
Sir, &s;aid Pivet: &s;he does not &s;u&s;pect that I
am your &s;ervant: I fear if &s;he did, as the la|dy
&s;eems to have a high &s;pirit, &s;he would for|bid
me her pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>I found Pivet had no mind to have this
part of his &s;ituation explained: his vanity
had been highly tickled at pa&s;&s;ing upon her
for a gentleman and <HI>my</HI> friend.&mdash;He
had, in obedience to my orders, &s;pent much
of his time with her during the few days that
I had been too ill to &s;ee her. I had, at my
fir&s;t introduction of him to her, cautioned
him again&s;t letting her know in what capaci|ty
he was with me: I did not then give him
my rea&s;ons for this, and he &s;uppo&s;ed they
<PB N="376" REF="378">
were no other, than that, finding it nece&s;&s;a|ry
to have him pretty much with her in her
confinement, I did not chu&s;e to alarm her
pride by the knowledge of his &s;tation. I did
not hint at my de&s;ign, till the day before I had
prevailed on her to write the letter to Mr.
Arnold. Pivet did not at all di&s;reli&s;h the pro|po&s;al:
he had not been blind to Mrs. Ger|rarde's
charms: he only &s;eemed &s;urprized at
my being willing to part with her &s;o &s;oon;
for he had not the lea&s;t conception of my rea|&s;ons
for carrying her off, and very naturally
concluded I was deeply engaged in an amour.
It was not difficult to gue&s;s his thoughts on
this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Pivet, &s;aid I, I mu&s;t premi&s;e one thing to
you: I a&s;&s;ure you there is not, nor ever was,
any intrigue between Mrs. Gerrarde and me.
I do not, however, pretend to vouch for her
cha&s;tity. It was no &s;ecret at V&mdash;hall that
&s;he had occa&s;ioned an unhappy breach in Mr.
Arnold's family; and that, and that <HI>only</HI> (as
I have a mo&s;t particular value and affection
for that family), was my motive to the carry|ing
this lady away. As I hope the di&s;union
(now the cau&s;e of it is removed) will no
longer &s;ub&s;i&s;t, I find it nece&s;&s;ary to provide
for Mrs. Gerrarde &s;ome way or other. A good
hu&s;band I would wi&s;h to be&s;tow on her. I do
not yet know whether I &s;hall be able to bring
her into any mea&s;ures; but if &s;he &s;hould be
prevailed on to accept of you, and I &s;hould
<PB N="377" REF="379">
make it worth your while to accept of her,
can you overlook the levity &s;he has been guil|ty
of, and re&s;olve to u&s;e her kindly?</P>
<P>He promi&s;ed he would make the be&s;t hu&s;|band
in the univer&s;e. I bid him not be too
&s;ure of &s;ucce&s;s, as I did not yet know Mrs.
Gerrarde's mind, and feared I &s;hould find it
hard to bring her into terms; adding, that
though I intended to threaten her, I &s;hould
be very unwilling to make u&s;e of compul&s;i|on;
but if &s;he &s;hould happen to like him,
without &s;u&s;pecting my de&s;ign, I might ac|compli&s;h
my purpo&s;e with le&s;s reluctance on
her &s;ide, and much more &s;atisfaction to my|&s;elf.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation he had ju&s;t had with her
elated him highly: &s;he had made him her
confidant; &s;he had implored his a&s;&s;i&s;tance;
&s;he had promi&s;ed an <HI>unbounded</HI> gratitude;
&s;he had prohibited <HI>my</HI> vi&s;its, and invited <HI>his.</HI>
All this facilitated my work, and I at one
time thought of letting her e'en work out her
fate, and run blindfold into my trap; for it
is plain, if Pivet had given into it, &s;he would
have marched off with him, and even marri|ed
him, to get out of my clutches; and
then, you know, &s;he could have blamed no
body but her&s;elf for the con&s;equences. But
I re&s;olved not to impo&s;e on the gyp&s;ey any
farther; but let her know what &s;he was to
expect before the bargain was concluded,
and at lea&s;t give her her option of having
<PB N="378" REF="380">
the power of continuing a jilt, or being ca|nonized
for a &s;aint.</P>
<P>I found things were now likely to take
&s;uch a turn as I wi&s;hed; but it &s;till required
management. Pivet, &s;aid I, you mu&s;t let
her &s;ee you no more to day, it will make
her prize your company the more: keep out
of the way, that you may not be &s;een by
Rachael; and give &s;uch orders in the hou&s;e,
as that there may be proper attendance for
the lady. One of my footmen &s;poke a little
French, and he had been directed to receive
and communicate Mrs. Rachael's orders in
the family.</P>
<P>Tho' Pivet a&s;&s;ured me that he thought
Mrs. Gerrarde was not &s;o ill as &s;he &s;aid &s;he
was, I yet thought it incumbent on me to
have the advice of a phy&s;ician. The people
with whom I lodged &s;aid I could not have a
better than the doctor who had attended
me, as he was reckoned very &s;kilful. I told
them, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, I believed hone&s;ty
was more requi&s;ite than &s;kill. They &s;aid
he was very hone&s;t too; &s;o I de&s;ired he
might be &s;ent for.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gerrarde, being determined to car|ry
on the farce of &s;ickne&s;s, pretended &s;he was
not able to ri&s;e; and the doctor was intro|duced
to her bed-&s;ide. As he could neither
under&s;tand his patient, nor make him&s;elf un|der&s;tood
by her, I had ordered the footman,
whom I mentioned to you before, as know|ing
<PB N="379" REF="381">
a little French, to wait at the chamber
door; for I was re&s;olved &s;o far to keep up my
re&s;entment and my importance, as not to
vouch&s;afe a&s;&s;i&s;ting at the conference; which,
by this means, became the mo&s;t ridiculous
&s;cene you can imagine. The doctor having
felt Mrs. Gerrarde's pul&s;e, propo&s;ed his que&s;|tions
by the footman, who ju&s;t peeped his
no&s;e in at the door. He explained them
(very ill I &s;uppo&s;e) to Rachael in Engli&s;h,
who re-repeated them to her lady within her
curtains; for &s;he would not &s;uffer them to
be drawn back. Mrs. Gerrarde's an&s;wers
travelled the &s;ame round-about way back ty
the doctor, who got them mangled in vero
bad French from his interpreter.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gerrarde, provoked, I believe, at
the doctor's vi&s;it, and very much tired of his
que&s;tions, a&s;ked peevi&s;hly where Mon&s;ieur
Pivet was? This inquiry I expected; and
the fellow who told me of it, had been orde|red
to inform her that Mon&s;ieur Pivet was
not at home.</P>
<P>The doctor, after leaving his patient, came
to me, and confirmed the character I had re|ceived
of him, both for &s;kill in his profe&s;&s;i|on,
and integrity in his practice; for he told
me very hone&s;tly, that he thought the lady
was in perfect health. I thought the doctor
de&s;erved a double &s;ee, and accordingly gave
it to him; reque&s;ting him, however, to con|tinue
his vi&s;its: for I told him, that, though
<PB N="380" REF="382">
the lady might really be very well, &s;he was,
however, a little vapouri&s;h.</P>
<P>I left her to her reflections the whole day.
Rachael inquired three or four times of the
footman if Mr. Pivet was come in, but was
always an&s;wered in the negative. I was plea|&s;ed
at her &s;ollicitude about him.</P>
<P>I de&s;ired him to wait on her the next day,
at the time the doctor paid his vi&s;it; and in|&s;tructed
Pivot to a&s;k the doctor, in her pre|&s;ence,
what he thought of her ca&s;e, and to
report his an&s;wer fairly to her; for I was re|&s;olved
not to let her imagine that &s;he impo|&s;ed
on me.</P>
<P>The doctor, by Pivet's means, di&s;cour&s;ed
with her more readily than he had done the
day before. Pivet a&s;ked his opinion of her
di&s;order, and the phy&s;ician declared it as free|ly
as he had done to me; adding, he &s;hould
not have repeated his vi&s;it, if I had not in|&s;i&s;ted
on it.</P>
<P>Pivet could not help &s;miling. Mrs. Ger|rarde
ob&s;erved it; for, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;he watch|ed
his countenance, and a&s;ked him what the
Doctor had &s;aid. He &s;ays, Madam, what
gives me a va&s;t deal of plea&s;ure; which is,
that your di&s;order is entirely imaginary.
He is an ignorant fellow, &s;aid Mrs. Gerrarde;
and you may tell him I de&s;ire to &s;ee him no
more. The poor doctor, who knew not what
&s;he &s;aid, made her half a dozen &s;crapes, and
withdrew.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="383">
She then drew back her curtain; and re|a&s;&s;uming
the &s;ubject &s;he had been upon the
day before with Pivet, a&s;ked him if he had
any conver&s;ation with me about her? and
what re&s;olution I had come to?</P>
<P>Pivet (who had begged I would leave this
conference entirely to his management) &s;eem|ed
to he&s;itate a little, and appeared melan|choly.
We have had &s;ome talk about you,
Madam, &s;aid he; and Mr. Faulkland tells me,
if you reject the nunnery &s;cheme (which I
think he &s;eems to be fonde&s;t of), that he has
a per&s;on in his thoughts, who, he believes,
will be a &s;uitable match for you, if you are
willing to accept of it; if not&mdash;here he
&s;top'd. What if I &s;hould not, Sir? Pray
&s;peak$ I hope, Madam, he will not carry
matters to an extremity. Extremity, Sir!
Do you think he can be brutal enough to
force me into a nunnery? Are there no laws
in France? I <HI>hope</HI> he will not, Madam; but
I can't pretend to an&s;wer for him: he is a
&s;trange man: he &s;eems out of temper too:
the doctor told him nothing ailed you; he
believes him, and &s;poke har&s;hly on the occa|&s;ion.
And what, &s;aid &s;he, is the match that
he calls <HI>&s;uitable?</HI> One of his footmen per|haps,
or his barber?</P>
<P>Pivet affected to look concerned. He tells
me, Madam, he has ca&s;t his eyes on a young
man, well born, and genteelly educated; not
contemptible in his per&s;onal accompli&s;hents,
<PB N="382" REF="384">
and one who he is &s;ure will make you a fond
and obliging hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Pivet &s;ighed deeply, and ca&s;t his eyes lan|gui&s;hingly
on her. You &s;eem concerned,
Sir, &s;aid &s;he. Do you know the per&s;on? It
is my doubt on that occa&s;ion, Madam, that
is the cau&s;e of my unea&s;ine&s;s. Pray explain
your&s;elf, Mr. Pivet. Madam, I dare not,
he replied, with great &s;olemnity. I will only
a&s;&s;ure you, that whoever the per&s;on be,
whom Mr. Faulkland has not yet named to
me, I think him the happie&s;t man in the
world. What can be his meaning, a&s;ked
Mrs. Gerrarde, for telling you <HI>&s;o</HI> much, and
yet concealing the per&s;on's name? He &s;ays,
he has not propo&s;ed it yet to the gentleman,
Madam; and as, he tells me, he can't in
honour conceal any part of your &s;tory, he is
fearful&mdash;I beg your pardon, Madam; you
will excu&s;e me if I do not repeat his &s;cruples
on this occa&s;ion. I under&s;tand, you, Sir.
He &s;uppo&s;es his friend will reject me. Some
&s;uch in&s;inuation he threw out, Madam, &s;aid
Pivet. I told him, that he need only permit
the gentleman to <HI>&s;ee</HI> you; and if he then
made any objection, he mu&s;t be the blinde&s;t
and mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible man alive. He &s;poke
this with a warmth that &s;eemed highly plea|&s;ing
to the lady. She bowed, and an&s;wered,
<HI>All</HI> men, Sir, are not as generous as you.
But what did Mr. Faulkland &s;ay to this? He
only &s;miled, and &s;aid he wi&s;hed his friend
<PB N="383" REF="385">
might think as I did; that he would tell me
his name another time; and that, in the
mean time, it would oblige him if my vi&s;its
to you were le&s;s frequent. Inhuman mon&s;ter,
&s;aid &s;he; would he debar me of the only &s;a|tisfaction
I have? Let me but live to get out
of his hands! if I can e&s;cape him by any
means, I will find ways to reckon with him
for this. Be &s;o good, Mr. Pivet, to tell him,
that I am content to take the per&s;on he offers,
let him be who he will: I expect nothing
from him but in&s;ults; therefore &s;hall not be
&s;urprized if I &s;ee my&s;elf &s;acrificed to &s;ome
de&s;picable wretch: but any, <HI>any</HI> thing is
better than to be in the power of &s;uch a ty|rant!
Madam, an&s;wered Pivet, you need
not fear the being compelled to accept of an
unworthy object: Mr. Faulkland declares,
that if you &s;hould ab&s;olutely di&s;like the
gentleman, when you &s;ee him, he will be
far from con&s;training you to take him for your
hu&s;band. The other choice is &s;till open to
you, and, by what I can judge, Mr. Faulk|land
&s;eems to wi&s;h you would give that the
preference. I would die fir&s;t, cried Mrs.
Gerrarde&mdash;The fool, does he think I can
be &s;o entrapped? No, no; the authority of a
hu&s;band, even of Faulkland's chu&s;ing, can|not
be &s;uch a bar to my revenge as the walls
of a nunnery would be.&mdash;Sir, I think my&s;elf
obliged to you, and flatter my&s;elf you would
have &s;erved me if you could. I may yet have
<PB N="384" REF="386">
it in my power to make you a return for your
kind intentions towards me. I pre&s;ume,
when Mr. Faulkland has di&s;po&s;ed of his pro|perty,
you will then be ab&s;olved of your
promi&s;e to him in regard to me, and will &s;till
have charity enough to befriend an unfortu|nate
woman. She wept, and Pivet owned he
was ready to do &s;o too; but con&s;training him|&s;elf,
prote&s;ted &s;he &s;hould command his
life, and withdrew full of &s;eeming unea&s;i|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>He told me what had pa&s;&s;ed between him
and the lady, and I could not help approv|ing
his management of the &s;cene, though
the rogue had &s;tretched beyond the truth;
but &s;tratagems, you know, are allowable in
love, and a lover he was now become in good
earne&s;t.</P>
<P>He had taken care to alarm Mrs. Gerrarde's
apprehen&s;ions at every pa&s;&s;age of acce&s;s. He
had informed her, that I had a hu&s;band for
her in my thoughts; and at the &s;ame time,
that he avoided the mo&s;t di&s;tant hint of its
being him&s;elf, he engaged her favour by
&s;eeming to wi&s;h it <HI>were.</HI> Then he took care
to in&s;inuate, at lea&s;t, a po&s;&s;ibility of her be|ing
refu&s;ed by the per&s;on de&s;igned for her,
and this he very naturally &s;uppo&s;ed would
rai&s;e his own con&s;equence with her, in ca&s;e
any &s;u&s;picion &s;hould fall on him, of his be|ing
the intended hu&s;band. He pretended I
had taken umbrage at his vi&s;iting her, &s;till
<PB N="385" REF="387">
more to inflame her re&s;entment again&s;t me,
and increa&s;e her impatience to deliver her&s;elf
out of my hands; at the &s;ame time he art|fully
hinted that he was not the man de&s;tin|ed
to be happy. This, as he &s;aw already he
was not unacceptable to her, he thought
would make him doubly welcome, when &s;he
&s;hould find her&s;elf no wor&s;e off. Then the
nunnery was mentioned, in terrorem, with
broad hints of my re&s;olution. In &s;hort, Pi|vet
played his part &s;o cunningly, that it had
all the effect he could have wi&s;hed; and
Mrs. Gerrarde, finding her &s;pirit matched,
was obliged to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>I own I did not expect to have &s;ucceeded
&s;o &s;oon; and without Pivet, who had now a
feeling in the affair, I certainly &s;hould not. I
re&s;olved directly to make the be&s;t u&s;e of the
advantage I had gained. I told Pivet that
he &s;hould be married the next day. He was
&s;o tran&s;ported at the thought, that he begged
I would give him leave to go to Mrs. Ger|rarde,
to declare his love and his good for|tune
together; for, Sir, &s;aid he, you know
&s;he promi&s;es to accept of whom&s;oever you
propo&s;e, and I hope &s;he will not de&s;pi&s;e
your choice &s;o much as &s;he thinks &s;he
&s;hall. Softly, &s;oftly, good Mon&s;ieur Pivet,
your violent hurry will &s;poil all. I do not
mean that you &s;hall &s;ee her till to-morrow.
Not till to-morrow! Ah Sir! do, I be&s;eech
<PB N="386" REF="388" MS="Y">
you, Sir, allow me; &s;he will think it very
cruel. (Poor Pivet, thought I, thou wilt
have enough of her.) Simpleton (to him),
this day's &s;u&s;pence will forward your bu&s;ine&s;s
more than all you could &s;ay to her in &s;even
hours: is it not enough you are &s;ure of her?
We have other things now to mind. What
plan of life do you purpo&s;e to pur&s;ue? You
know I have promi&s;ed to do hand&s;omely for
you.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid he, I always intended to follow
the bu&s;ine&s;s I was bred to; and if this piece
of extraordinary good fortune had <HI>not</HI> hap|pened
to me, I did purpo&s;e, tho' you have
been the be&s;t of ma&s;ters to me, to have a&s;k|ed
your permi&s;&s;ion to return to my friends,
in order to &s;ettle in my trade, as I have &s;ome
capital of my own. But to be &s;ure, Sir, I
&s;hall be directed in this, as in every thing
el&s;e, by your will and plea&s;ure. I approve
of your de&s;ign intirely, &s;aid I; but there are
certain conditions that mu&s;t be previou&s;ly
&s;ettled between you and me. In the fir&s;t
place, tell me hone&s;tly, what is the capital
you &s;ay you are worth.</P>
<P>He an&s;wered, his father had left him a|bout
eight thou&s;and livres, which were in
the hands of a banker in Paris, whom he
named to me, and referred me to him for
confirmation of the truth of what he told
me.</P>
<P><PB N="387" REF="389">
Well, &s;aid I, this will go a good way to|wards
&s;etting you up in your own bu&s;ine&s;s.
Where do you think of &s;ettling?</P>
<P>He an&s;wered, Paris was the be&s;t place for
his trade.</P>
<P>On that I put an ab&s;olute negative; I &s;aid
Paris was too much frequented by my coun|trymen,
to be a proper place for Mrs. Ger|rarde
to make her appearance in, as &s;he was
likely to meet there with more of her acquain|tance
than might be convenient: I told him
I had no objection to any other large provin|cial
town.</P>
<P>He &s;aid he was born at Dijon, and &s;hould
like to go thither, as he had many friends
there.</P>
<P>Be it &s;o, &s;aid I: What I purpo&s;e doing
for you is this. Mrs. Gerrarde has eight
hundred pounds of her own; I will add as
much more to it, for which I will give you
my bond, till I can have the money remitted
from England; and this you &s;hall &s;ettle on
her, that &s;he may be &s;ure of a &s;upport in
ca&s;e of your death, and the intere&s;t you &s;hall
allow her for her own &s;eparate u&s;e, but with|out
her knowing that you are tied down to
it, that you may have it in your power to o|blige
her.</P>
<P>He made no reply, but acquie&s;ced with a
low bow.</P>
<P>I laughed at the &s;implicity of his counte|nance.
Pivet, &s;aid I, though I have taken
<PB N="388" REF="390">
care of Mrs. Gerrarde's intere&s;t, I do not in|tend
to neglect yours, provided you make no
demur to the terms. You already know my
rea&s;ons for proceeding as I have done in this
affair. I have great cau&s;e to apprehend Mrs.
Gerrarde's vindictive &s;pirit, if &s;he &s;hould find
means, which I know &s;he will endeavour at,
to lay open the real &s;tate of this tran&s;action
to &s;ome people in England. This might fru|&s;trate
all that I have been at &s;o much pains to
accompli&s;h; be it your care then to prevent
it. I cannot wi&s;h you to u&s;e har&s;h mea&s;ures
with your wife; but if you have addre&s;s
enough to prevent a corre&s;pondence with any
one in England, (an elopement, for both
your &s;akes, I am not willing to &s;uppo&s;e;
though I think, for &s;ome time at lea&s;t, you
mu&s;t keep a &s;trict eye over her) if, as I &s;aid,
you can prevent a corre&s;pondence, I think it
will an&s;wer my purpo&s;e; and that I may
make it your intere&s;t to do this, I will bind
my&s;elf, by as &s;trong an obligation as the law
can make, to pay you two hundred pounds
a year Engli&s;h, &s;o long as you keep your wife
within the bounds pre&s;cribed; provided, if,
after three years, I find tho&s;e terms no lon|ger
nece&s;&s;ary, they &s;hall, if I then chu&s;e it,
become void. I &s;hall al&s;o add &s;omething to
enable you to fit up a hou&s;e and a &s;hop, that
you need not be under a nece&s;&s;ity of break|ing
in upon your capital.</P>
<P><PB N="389" REF="391">
Pivet's gratitude overflowed at his lips for
this (as he called it) noble provi&s;ion. He
&s;aid, he made no doubt of gaining &s;o far up|on
Mrs. Gerrarde's affections, as to be able
effectually to fulfil his covenant, without
u&s;ing violent methods; but, &s;aid he, at all
events, I warrant you &s;hall hear no more of
her.</P>
<P>Preliminaries thus adju&s;ted, I &s;ent for a
notary of reputation, to whom I gave in&s;truc|tions
to draw up two &s;eparate articles for the
purpo&s;es mentioned; the latter was to be a
&s;ecret between Pivet and me, as it was by no
means proper for Mrs. Gerrarde to be let in|to
it. The other, which regarded her own
particular &s;ettlement, was intended for her
peru&s;al and approbation. I charged the no|tary
to u&s;e di&s;patch, and he promi&s;ed to have
both the papers ready by next morning,
as al&s;o the bond which I was to give Pi|vet
for the payment of eight hundred
pounds.</P>
<P>The lawyer brought the papers according
to his promi&s;e, and they were &s;igned, &s;ealed,
and delivered in due form. That which was
to be the private agreement between Pivet
and me, was worded in con&s;equence of an
article which I drew up my&s;elf, and made
Pivet &s;ign; wherein I &s;et forth particulars at
large.</P>
<P>Pivet was very impatient to &s;ee his belo|ved,
but a little unea&s;y le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be di&s;|gu&s;ted
<PB N="390" REF="392">
with him, when &s;he &s;hould come to
know the &s;ituation he had been in. I bid
him not be di&s;couraged, telling him I &s;hould
&s;et off that circum&s;tance of his having been
my gentleman (for &s;o I cho&s;e to call him)
in the mo&s;t favourable light. I pre&s;ented
him with a very elegant &s;uit of cloaths,
which I had never worn, and which fitted
him very well, as you know he is nearly of
my &s;ize. You cannot imagine how hand&s;ome
the fellow looked when he was dre&s;&s;ed, for
he had linen and every thing el&s;e &s;uitable to
his cloaths.</P>
<P>I then de&s;ired him to wait on his godde&s;s;
but he, who had been &s;o eager a little be|fore,
was now quite aba&s;hed at the thoughts
of making his preten&s;ions known to the lady,
and intreated me to pre&s;ent him to her. I
&s;aw he was quite di&s;concerted at the &s;erious
&s;cene he was going to engage in.</P>
<P>I pitied him, and told him I would go with
him to Mrs. Gerrarde; but that it was pro|per
fir&s;t to prepare her a little.</P>
<P>He &s;aid he thought &s;o too.</P>
<P>I immediately &s;ent for Rachael, and &s;peak|ing
to her at the door, without letting her &s;ee
Pivet, I bid her tell her mi&s;tre&s;s that I pur|po&s;ed
making her a vi&s;it in half an hour,
and &s;hould introduce the gentleman, whom
I expected &s;he would, according to her pro|mi&s;e,
receive at my hands for her hu&s;band;
re&s;erving to her&s;elf &s;till the liberty of chu|&s;ing
<PB N="391" REF="393">
the other alternative, in ca&s;e &s;he di&s;liked
him.</P>
<P>Pivet &s;hewed the &s;ollicitude of a lover, af|ter
this me&s;&s;age was &s;ent to his mi&s;tre&s;s; Poor
dear lady, &s;aid he, how I pity her? What
mu&s;t &s;he &s;uffer in this interval? But your
pre&s;ence, Mon&s;ieur Pivet, &s;aid I, will di&s;pel
all her fears, and make her the happie&s;t of
women.</P>
<P>The poor fellow was out of countenance,
and, I dare &s;ay, as anxious as Mrs. Gerrarde.</P>
<P>As I received no an&s;wer from her to my
me&s;&s;age, I con&s;trued her &s;ilence as leave to at|tend
her; and accordingly, at the appointed
time, I entered her apartment, leading Pivet
by the hand.</P>
<P>She was &s;itting at a table, leaning her head
on one of her hands: &s;he ca&s;t a look of &s;corn
at me, and immediately withdrew her eyes,
not &s;o much as deigning to glance them at
Pivet, little imagining that it was <HI>he</HI> who ac|companied
me, though &s;he knew it was her
intended bridegroom.</P>
<P>Pivet was not able to &s;peak; he trembled,
and, like a true inamorato, ran to her, clapt
one knee to the ground, and ventured,
though with great diffidence, to take one of
her hands.</P>
<P>This action obliged the haughty fair one
to vouch&s;afe him a glance of her eye.</P>
<P><PB N="392" REF="394">
Her &s;urprize, &s;pite of her a&s;&s;umed airs of
grandeur, was not to be concealed; it was
apparent, &s;he coloured, and though &s;he in|tended
to have been &s;olemn and lo&s;ty, &s;he
even <HI>&s;tared;</HI> and I could di&s;cover a little
gleam of plea&s;ure dance over her counte|nance.</P>
<P>What! Mon&s;ieur Pivet? And then &s;he
looked at me, as if for an explanation.</P>
<P>Yes, madam, &s;aid I, Mon&s;ieur Pivet <HI>is</HI>
the man, (I was going to &s;ay the <HI>happy</HI> man,
but I did not mean to compliment her; my
bu&s;ine&s;s was not to make her think I was do|ing
her a favour.) It has been your good for|tune
to make a conque&s;t of him; and in the
hope of your making him a good wife, as I
am &s;ure he will make you a good hu&s;band, I
have con&s;ented to the match; and I &s;poke
this in the tone of one, who thinking he has
conferred a great obligation on an unde&s;er|ving
object, expects to be thanked for it.</P>
<P>The woman, with all her art and a&s;&s;urance
to boot, was quite confounded. I did not
give her time to recover her&s;elf, but taking
the &s;ettlement out of my pocket, and reading
it to her, Look there, madam, and &s;ee if I
have injured you in the di&s;po&s;al of your per|&s;on
and your fortune.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gerrarde, always alert when her in|tere&s;t
was in the que&s;tion, took the paper,
and notwith&s;tanding her confu&s;ion, read it
entirely over. Pivet's hand&s;ome appearance,
<PB N="393" REF="395">
joined to her former prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, had made
&s;o good an impre&s;&s;ion on her, that &s;he began
to think the matter worth attending to.
When &s;he had read the paper, &s;he put it in|to
Pivet's hands. Sir, &s;aid &s;he, it &s;hould ap|pear
by this that you have acted generou&s;ly;
but as I have already been impo&s;ed upon by
that gentleman (looking at me) all this may,
for aught I know, be a deceit; but as it is
not in my power to make terms for my &s;elf,
it is to no purpo&s;e for me to make objections,
or to enquire any farther. I am ready to
accept your offer, only I &s;hould be glad to
know who the man really is, that I am to
make my hu&s;band.</P>
<P>She &s;poke this with &s;uch an air of di&s;dain,
that the poor lover, &s;hrunk up and dimini&s;h|ed
in his own eyes, left me to make an an|&s;wer.
Mrs. Gerrarde, &s;aid I, I declare to
you &s;olemnly that there is no deception in any
thing which you &s;ee, nor any foul play meant
to you. This young man, whom I now pre|&s;ent
to you for your hu&s;band, is well born,
and has many genteel relations in this coun|try;
he has it in his power, to my certain
knowledge, to make good the &s;ettlement he
propo&s;es for you, which I will take care to
&s;ee properly &s;ecured. That part of it which
is your own property, you have now in your
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the other half I know is in his.
He was brought up to a creditable bu&s;ine&s;s,
<PB N="394" REF="396">
which he intends to follow. I know him to
be good natured, and of an obliging temper.
He lived with me &s;ome time, and accompa|nied
me in my travels. I &s;uppo&s;e his having
been my gentleman, which &s;tation he did
uot accept through nece&s;&s;ity, will not be a
material objection (and I &s;miled and affected
to look very proud), and I only mention it to
convince you that I have no de&s;ign of decei|ving
you, or concealing any part of his cha|racter.</P>
<P>Pivet coloured (for I &s;tole a &s;ide glance at
him) and looked &s;heepi&s;h. He began an
aukward compliment with a bow, and &lsquo;I
hope, madam&rsquo;&mdash;but I relieved him; and
&s;peaking to Mrs. Gerrarde, You know all now
madam, that can be known; therefore, if
you are di&s;po&s;ed to keep your word, let us put
an end to this bu&s;ine&s;s to-day. To-day, Sir!
Yes, to-day, madam. What occa&s;ion is
there for farther delay?</P>
<P>Pivet now plucked up his courage, and
begged, &s;ince &s;he had con&s;ented, that &s;he
would not defer his happine&s;s. I told her,
between mirth and chiding, that I was in
ha&s;te to get rid of my charge, and was there|fore
determined to make her over to Mr. Pi|vet
that evening; and telling her I would
give orders about the ceremony, left the lo|vers
to make out for them&s;elves a &s;cheme of
conjugal felicity. Pivet pleaded his own cau&s;e
&s;o effectually, that, in the evening, I had the
<PB N="395" REF="397">
&s;atisfaction of be&s;towing, with my own hand,
that ine&s;timable trea&s;ure of virtue and meek|ne&s;s,
Mrs. Gerrarde, on my faithful Squire,
Mon&s;ieur Pivet; to the no &s;mall joy of the
latter, and I believe, if the truth were known,
to the no great mortification of the former.
Mrs. Rachael and my&s;elf were the only wit|ne&s;&s;es
of this illu&s;trious union.</P>
<P>When the ceremony was over, I ap|proached,
according to cu&s;tom, to congra|tulate
and &s;alute the bride; but &s;he turned
her &s;aucy cheek to me, and affected the
whole night va&s;t dignity of behaviour; yet it
was &s;o foreign to her nature, that it appear|ed
ridiculous; however it was better than
ranting.</P>
<P>I invited them both to &s;up with me, and
treated Pivet with a familiar civility that &s;eem|ed
to plea&s;e him highly, as it did him credit
in the pre&s;ence of his lady.</P>
<P>After &s;upper, Pivet entreated me to com|plete
the friendly and generous offices I
had already done him, by undertaking the
&s;ettlement of all money matters for him. As
he knew I intended to go to Paris, he beg|ged
I would receive for him the &s;um he had
in the hands of the banker, which, he &s;aid,
if I would remit to him, it would enable him
to enter upon his bu&s;ine&s;s immediately. At
the &s;ame time he (with no ill grace) pre&s;ented
me my bond again, a&s;&s;uring me he relied in|tirely
<PB N="396" REF="398">
upon my honour for the execution of
my promi&s;e to him, farther reque&s;ting that
I would put that, together with Mrs. Ger|rarde's
money, if &s;he approved of it, into
&s;uch hands as I &s;hould judge mo&s;t proper for
her advantage.</P>
<P>I was plea&s;ed at the openne&s;s of his pro|ceedings,
and promi&s;ed to do every thing for
their mutual &s;atisfaction; but in&s;i&s;ted on his
keeping the bond, or lodging it in &s;ome pro|per
hand, till I could redeem it, by paying
the money, which &s;hould take care &s;hould be
&s;peedily done. I told him I thought the
&s;ooner he &s;et out for his own province the
better. He &s;aid, he &s;hould be ready the next
day, if Mrs. Gerrarde (for he did not yet
pre&s;ume to call her by his own name) did
not object to it. He appealed to her with
his looks.</P>
<P>She had &s;carce conde&s;cended to open her
lips before; but now an&s;wered, You may be
&s;ure, Sir, I &s;hall not think it too &s;oon to get
out of a pri&s;on.</P>
<P>He a&s;ked her if &s;he cho&s;e to take her maid
Rachael along with her?</P>
<P>Certainly, &s;he &s;aid; I &s;hould not be fond of
having a &s;ervant about me, by whom I &s;hould
not be under&s;tood.</P>
<P>Rachael was now called in, and the thing
propo&s;ed to her. She &s;eemed rather inclined
to return to England; but I told her &s;he
<PB N="397" REF="399">
could not, in gratitude, de&s;ert her lady in a
&s;trange country; and that if &s;he had a mind
to make me her friend, which &s;he &s;hould find
me upon any future occa&s;ion, &s;he would attend
her home, and continue with her till her
mi&s;tre&s;s was willing to part with her.</P>
<P>The girl upon this con&s;ented to &s;tay, and
received Mrs. Gerrarde's orders to prepare
for their departure the next day.</P>
<P>In the morning I made Pivet a pre&s;ent for
his travelling charges, and Rachael another;
telling her according to the account I &s;hould
have of her behaviour, that I would be kind
to her. She made me all the promi&s;es that
I could de&s;ire; a&s;&s;uring me, that it was
purely to oblige me that &s;he &s;taid with Mrs.
Gerrarde.</P>
<P>Pivet told me, that he would &s;end the &s;um
which his wife had, in bills to me, to be ap|propriated
in the manner agreed on: for, he
&s;aid, that having that morning mentioned to
her my genero&s;ity, in relation to the bond,
&s;he had owned, that, notwith&s;tanding her
re&s;entment to me, &s;he had no di&s;tru&s;t of my
honour in <HI>tho&s;e</HI> particulars.</P>
<P>I took this opportunity of telling Pivet,
that when he could get his wife in the hu|mour,
he might prevail on her to give an
in&s;trument, impowering my &s;teward to re|ceive
the little income of her jointure at A&s;h|by,
which I would take care &s;hould be re|mitted
<PB N="398" REF="400">
to him; for, trifling as it was, it
might be &s;erviceable.</P>
<P>When they were ready to &s;et forward on
their journey, I begged leave to &s;peak a few
words to madam Pivet by her&s;elf. She &s;eem|ed
not inclined to the conference, but her
hu&s;band very obligingly pre&s;&s;ing her not to
part with me in enmity, and at the &s;ame
time quitting the room, &s;he was obliged to
hear me.</P>
<P>I then very frankly a&s;ked her pardon for
the lengths I had gone; telling her, that I
hoped time, and her own good &s;en&s;e, would
convince her that &s;he was more obliged to
me, than her pa&s;&s;ion would then give her
leave to &s;ee. Remember, madam, I have
kept my word with you. You are now mar|ried
to a very de&s;erving young man; you
have a competent &s;upport during your life.
Happine&s;s is in your power, if you do not
wilfully ca&s;t it away from you. Shew now
that greatne&s;s of mind of which you have &s;o
often boa&s;ted, by forgiving the man, who has,
as you think, injured you; and re&s;olving at
once on a behaviour that &s;hall, in your turn,
intitle you, not only to the forgivene&s;s, but
even to the e&s;teem, of tho&s;e whom you have
injured.</P>
<P>I would have preached on, and given her
more good advice, but &s;he cut me &s;hort,
with this deci&s;ive an&s;wer. Sir, I neither de|&s;ire
your coun&s;el nor your good opinion;
<PB N="399" REF="401">
Mr. Pivet <HI>may</HI> de&s;erve &s;ome regard from me,
but <HI>you</HI> I never will forgive, and &s;he flung
from me.</P>
<P>I called in Pivet, and telling him I was in|finitely
plea&s;ed at the good di&s;po&s;ition I found
his lady in, I wi&s;hed him all happine&s;s and a
&s;afe journey, and they &s;et out directly for
Dijon.</P>
<P>And now, my dear Bidulph, &s;top, to
prai&s;e, to admire, to wonder at my virtue!
I, who have had one of the fine&s;t women in
England in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, for &s;o many days
(and by the way was not her aver&s;ion) to
yield up her (by me) unpolluted charms to
the arms of another! Add to this, that it has
co&s;t me more to make one woman hone&s;t,
than it need have done to have made half a
dozen&mdash;otherwi&s;e. I had like to have writ
a &s;trange ugly word, that was ju&s;t at the nib
of my pen.</P>
<P>If you relate my &s;tory with the laudable
partiality of a friend, judiciou&s;ly aboli&s;hing
the context (for which you may have many
precedents), and neatly &s;plicing together the
u&s;eful fragments, &s;hall I not appear to po&s;te|rity
as great as Scipio him&s;elf? Ah! Sir
George, if we knew the &s;ecret &s;prings of
many of tho&s;e actions which dazzle us, in
the hi&s;tories of the renowned heroes of old,
it is not impo&s;&s;ible but the wonderous page
might dwindle into as in&s;ignificant a tale as
mine is.</P>
<P><PB N="400" REF="402">
Well, I thank my good genius that has led
me &s;afely through &s;uch a labyrinth as I had
got into. In getting rid of that woman
(and not di&s;gracefully neither), I feel as if I
had &s;haken off a great load. But what a
gracele&s;s baggage it is, not to thank me for
my kindne&s;s. I, who have been more than
a father to her, in &s;aving her fir&s;t from per|dition,
and then &s;ettling her well in the
world&mdash;but there is no obliging &s;ome
tempers.</P>
<P>I &s;hall leave this place to-morrow, for I
mu&s;t ha&s;ten to Paris, to put every thing on
a good footing for the new-married pair;
and then I will go and ramble I do not care
whither, for another year. I &s;hall lodge at
Paris, where I did before, and de&s;ire you
will write to me directly an account of all
that pa&s;&s;es within the circle of your family.
Let your &s;i&s;ter and my lady Bidulph know in
what manner I have di&s;po&s;ed of Mrs. Ger|rarde;
but be &s;ure you do it di&s;creetly, and
take care not to mention that paultry cir|cum&s;tance
of her &s;ettlement, or any other
private agreement with Pivet. I know Mrs.
Arnold's delicacy would be hurt by the
knowledge of this; therefore beware of
dropping the lea&s;t hint of it, at your peril.
Tell lady Bidulph I will pray devoutly for her
daughter's happine&s;s; if what I have done
will promote it, it will not a little contribute
to my own; tho' I begin to feel it is not to
<PB N="401" REF="403">
be expected in this life, at lea&s;t by &s;uch a
hopele&s;s wanderer as I am.</P>
<P>I could &s;it now, and indite melancholy
ver&s;es, or write an elegy, or make my will,
or do any other &s;plenetic thing: in &s;hort, I
have a good mind to turn monk and go into
a mona&s;tery. I am &s;ure I &s;hould have lady
Bidulph's vote for that.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear Bidulph, you will not
hear from me again, perhaps, till I am in
another region.</P>
<P>Nov. 30.</P>
