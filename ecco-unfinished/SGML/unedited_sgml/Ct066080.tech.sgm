<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>EDUCATION, though of great
importance to the public, as
well as to individuals, is no where
carried on in any perfect manner.
Upon the revival of arts and &s;cien|ces
in Europe, the learned langua|ges,
being the only inlets to know|ledge,
occupied almo&s;t the whole
time that commonly can be &s;pared
for education. The&s;e languages
are and will always be extremely
ornamental; but though they have
become le&s;s e&s;&s;ential to education
than formerly, yet the &s;ame plan
continues without much variation.
We never think of making impro$e|ments,
becau&s;e cu&s;tom and fami|liarity
hide the defects of the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
plan.</P>
<P>THE faculty of reflecting, and
forming general ob&s;ervations, is ca|pable
<PB N="vi" REF="3">
of great improvements by pro|per
exerci&s;e. This branch of educa|tion,
though capital, is not cultivated
with due care. Nature, in her
cour&s;e, begins with particulars, and
a&s;cends gradually, to what is general
and ab&s;tract. But nature is ill &s;e|conded
in the ordinary cour&s;e of e|ducation.
We are fir&s;t employed, it
is true, in languages, geography, hi|&s;tory,
natural philo&s;ophy, &s;ubjects
that deal in particulars. But, at one
bound, we are carried to the mo&s;t
ab&s;tract &s;tudies; logics, for exam|ple,
and metaphy&s;ics. The&s;e in|deed
give exerci&s;e to the rea&s;oning
faculty; but it will not be &s;aid that
they are the be&s;t qualified for initia|ting
a young per&s;on in the art of rea|&s;oning.
Their ob&s;curity and intri|cacy
unfit them for that office. Here
then is evidently a void, which mu&s;t
be filled up, if we wi&s;h that edu|cation
&s;hould be &s;ucce&s;sful. To im|prove
<PB N="vii" REF="4">
the faculty of ab&s;tracting,
and gradually to lead us from par|ticular
facts to general propo&s;itions,
the tender mind ought at fir&s;t to be
exerci&s;ed in ob&s;ervations of the
&s;imple&s;t kind, &s;uch as may ea&s;ily
be comprehended. To that end,
the &s;ubject ought, by all means, to
be familiar; and it ought al&s;o to be
agreeable and in&s;tructive.</P>
<P>IN the pre&s;ent collection, human
nature is cho&s;en for the &s;ubject; be|cau&s;e
it is of all the mo&s;t familiar,
and not le&s;s in&s;tructive than familiar.
In this &s;ubject there are indeed ma|ny
intricate parts, that require the
mature&s;t under&s;tanding. But this
little e&s;&s;ay is confined to the rudi|ments
of the &s;cience, and no maxim
or ob&s;ervation is admitted, but
what is plain, and ea&s;ily apprehend|ed.
Apothegms that re&s;olve into a
play of words, which &s;well every
<PB N="viii" REF="5">
collection ancient and modern, are
carefully rejected. Wittici&s;ms may
be indulged for the &s;ake of recrea|tion;
but they are improper where
in&s;truction is the aim.</P>
<P>BUT, as &s;aid, it is not &s;ufficient
that the &s;ubject be familiar and
in&s;tructive; it ought al&s;o to be a|greeable,
in order to attract young
minds. Unconnected maxims,
however in&s;tructive, will not in
youth be reli&s;hed without &s;ea&s;on|ing;
and as the be&s;t &s;ea&s;oning
for &s;uch a work, are &s;tories and
fables, a number of them are here
&s;elected with &s;ome care. The&s;e &s;erve
not only to attract a young reader,
but are in reality the fine&s;t illu&s;tra|tions
that can be given of ab&s;tract
truths.</P>
<P>FABLES in Ae&s;op's manner tend
no doubt to in&s;truction when they
&s;ugge&s;t &s;ome moral truth; and ac|cordingly
<PB N="ix" REF="6">
place is here given to &s;uch
to them as contain an obvious mo|ral.
I am however far from think|ing
&s;uch fables the mo&s;t proper in
the dawn of rea&s;on; for to di&s;gui&s;e
men under the ma&s;k of goats and
bulls, tends to little other purpo&s;e
than to ob&s;cure the moral in&s;truc|tion.
Stories, real or invented,
where per&s;ons are introduced in their
native appearance, &s;erve much bet|ter
for illu&s;tration; and of &s;uch ac|cordingly
I have not been &s;paring.</P>
<P>THERE is another rea&s;on &s;till
more weighty, for preferring &s;tories
of this kind. If they improve the
under&s;tanding, they more eminent|ly
improve the heart. Incidents
that move the pa&s;&s;ions make a deep
impre&s;&s;ion, e&s;pecially upon young
minds. And where virtue and vice
are delineated, with the con&s;equen|ces
they naturally produces, &s;uch im|pre&s;&s;ions
<PB N="x" REF="7">
have a wonderful good ef|fect;
they confirm us in virtue, and
deter us from vice. This indeed is
the mo&s;t illu&s;trious branch of edu|cation;
but as it falls not under the
pre&s;ent plan, I mu&s;t deny my&s;elf the
&s;atisfaction of expatiating upon it.</P>
<P>THIS trifle was compiled with a
private view, and it proved of &s;ome
u&s;e. But if in any degree u&s;eful,
why &s;hould it lurk in a corner? It
will be &s;ub&s;tantially u&s;eful, if it but
move others to labour upon the &s;ame
plan. Education may well be deem|ed
one of the capital articles of go|vernment.
It is intitled to the nur|&s;ing
care of the legi&s;lature; for no
&s;tate ever long flouri&s;hed, where e|ducation
was neglected. And even
in a private view, not a &s;ingle
branch of it is below the attention
of the grave&s;t writer.</P>

human nature.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Nature of Man.</HEAD>
<P>MANKIND through all ages
have been the &s;ame: the fir&s;t
times beheld fir&s;t the pre&s;ent
vices. Yet who could imagine, that
there is &s;uch contrariety even in the &s;ame
character? It was Nero, who &s;igning a
&s;entence again&s;t a criminal, wi&s;hed to
the gods he could not write.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="10">
<MILESTONE N="1">Nothing is more common than love
converted into hatred. And we have
&s;een in&s;tances of hatred converted into
love.</P>
<P>If our faces were not alike, we could
not di&s;tingui&s;h a man from a bea&s;t. If
they were altogether alike, we could
not di&s;tingui&s;h one man from another.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Principle of Liberty.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="2">So fond of liberty is man, that to re|&s;train
him from any thing, however in|different,
is &s;ufficient to make that thing
an object of de&s;ire.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Principle of Society.</HEAD>
<P>It is more tolerable to be always alone,
than never to be &s;o.</P>
<P>So prone is man to &s;ociety, and &s;o
happy in it, that to reli&s;h perpetual &s;o|litude,
one mu&s;t be an angel or a brute.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3">In a &s;olitary &s;tate no creature is more
timid than man; in &s;ociety none more
bold.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="11">
Every one partakes of the honour
that is be&s;towed upon the worthy.</P>
<P>The number of offenders le&s;&s;ens the
di&s;grace of the crime; for a common
reproach is no reproach. Hence in po|pulous
cities, the frequency of adultery,
drunkenne&s;s, robbery.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Moral Sen&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>No man ever did a de&s;igned injury to<MILESTONE N="4">
another, without doing a greater to
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Man's chief good is an upright $$nd,
which no earthly power can be&s;tow, nor
take from him.</P>
<P>If you &s;hould e&s;cape the cen&s;ure of o|thers,
hope not to e&s;cape your own.</P>
<P>No man is thoroughly contemned by
others, but who is fir&s;t contemned by
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>A man is more unhappy in reproach|ing
him&s;elf when guilty, than in being
reproached by others when innocent.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="12">
The evil I bring upon my&s;elf is the
harde&s;t to bear.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="5">When intere&s;t is at variance with con|&s;cience,
any di&s;tinction to make them
friends will &s;erve the hollow-hearted.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="6">Seldom is a man &s;o wicked but he
will endeavour to reconcile, if po&s;&s;ible,
his actions with his duty. But &s;uch chi|caning
will not lay his con&s;cience a|&s;leep:
it will notwith&s;tanding haunt
him like a gho&s;t, and frighten him out
of his wits.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="7">In great crimes, the man's own con|&s;cience
proves often to be the &s;tronge&s;t
witne&s;s again&s;t him.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Our powers and faculties are much
limited.</HEAD>
<P>It is a true ob&s;ervation, that no man
ever excelled in two different arts. It
is an certain, there never was a man,
who might not have excelled in &s;ome
one art. How is it then that their num|ber
is &s;o &s;canty? Plainly from the folly
<PB N="5" REF="13">
of deeming our&s;elves capable of every
thing, and of de&s;pi&s;ing what co&s;ts us the
lea&s;t trouble.</P>
<P>We are often mi&s;taken for men of plea|&s;ure,
becau&s;e we are not men of bu&s;i|ne&s;s;
and for men of bu&s;ine&s;s, becau&s;e
we are not men of plea&s;ure. A great
genius finds lei&s;ure for both; an inferior
genius for neither.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have great application to
trifles, have &s;eldom a capacity for mat|ters
of importance.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Pain affects us more than plea&s;ure.</HEAD>
<P>Happine&s;s is le&s;s valued when we po&s;|&s;e&s;s
it, than when we have lo&s;t it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Diffe$ent pains compared.</HEAD>
<P>The pains of the mind are harder to
bear than tho&s;e of the body.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Pa&s;&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>A pa&s;&s;ion that ingro&s;&s;es the mind,<MILESTONE N="8">
leaves no room for any other.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="14">
The plaine&s;t man animate$ with pa&s;|&s;ion,
affects us more than the greate&s;t
orator without it.</P>
<P>We ought to di&s;tru&s;t our pa&s;&s;ions, e|ven
when they appear the mo&s;t rea&s;on|able.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Our opinions are &s;wayed more by
feeling than by argument.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="9">Every man e&s;teems his own misfor|tune
the greate&s;t.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10">The pre&s;ent misfortune is always
deemed the greate&s;t: And therefore &s;mall
cau&s;es are &s;ufficient to make a man un|ea&s;y,
when great ones are not in the way.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="11">That rea&s;on which is favourable to our
de&s;ires, appears always the be&s;t.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="12">Change of condition begets new pa&s;|&s;ions,
and con&s;equently new opinions.</P>
<P>In matters of demon&s;tration, it argues
a weakne&s;s of judgment to differ: not
&s;o in matters of opinion; for the&s;e are
influenced by affection perhaps more than
by rea&s;on. A plain man, &s;incere and cre|dulous,
will build upon very weak te&s;ti|mony;
<PB N="7" REF="15">
while the diffident and &s;u&s;pi|cious
will &s;carce be &s;atisfied with the
&s;tronge&s;t. It is the province of rea&s;on
and experience to correct the&s;e ex|tremes.</P>
<P>Is is idle as well as ab&s;urd, to impo&s;e<MILESTONE N="13">
our opinions upon others. The &s;ame
ground of conviction operates differently
on the &s;ame man in different circum&s;tan|ces,
and on different men in the &s;ame
circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>A man is no &s;ooner found le&s;s guilty<MILESTONE N="14">
than expected, but he is concluded more
innocent than he is.</P>
<P>Slight per&s;ecution makes converts:<MILESTONE N="15">
&s;evere per&s;ecution, on the contrary,
hardens the heart again&s;t all conviction.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who take their opinions upon
tru&s;t, are always the mo&s;t violent.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>We judge of mo&s;t things by com|pari&s;on.</HEAD>
<P>A man does but faintly reli&s;h that fe|licity
which co&s;ts him nothing: Happy
they whom pain leads to plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="16">
Joy &s;ugge&s;ts plea&s;ant thoughts, and
grief tho&s;e that are melancholy.</P>
<P>A new &s;orrow recalls all the former.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>A man is always in a hurry to de|fend
his weak &s;ide.</HEAD>
<P>It is in &s;ome mea&s;ure pleading guilty,
to be over ha&s;ty or &s;olicitous in making
a defence.</P>
<P>He acknowledges the fact, who turns
angry at an a&s;per&s;ion.</P>
<P>Who ince&s;&s;antly vaunts of his probi|ty
and honour, and &s;wears to gain be|lief,
has not even the art of counter|feiting.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Cu&s;tom.</HEAD>
<P>Men are governed by cu&s;tom. Not
one of a thou&s;and thinks for him&s;elf;
and the few who are emancipated, dare
not act up to their freedom, for fear of
being thought whim&s;ical.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="17">
Cu&s;tom is the great leveller. It cor|rects
the inequality of fortune, by le&s;&s;en|ing
equally the plea&s;ures of the prince,
and the pains of the pea&s;ant.</P>
<P>Chu&s;e what is the mo&s;t fit, cu&s;tom
will make it the mo&s;t agreeable.</P>
<P>Cu&s;tom be&s;tows ea&s;e and confidence<MILESTONE N="16">
even in the middle of dangers.</P>
<P>Our opinions are greatly influenced<MILESTONE N="17">
by cu&s;tom.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Magnanimity.</HEAD>
<P>A great mind will neither give an
affront, nor bear it.</P>
<P>A firm mind becomes rather more in|flexible<MILESTONE N="18">
by poverty. If any thing can
mollify and render it more &s;ociable, it
mu&s;t be pro&s;perity.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Courage.</HEAD>
<P>Who hath not courage to revenge,
will never find genero&s;ity to forgive.</P>
<P>Cowards die many times: the valiant
never ta&s;te of death but once.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="18">
<MILESTONE N="19">Hope, is this mixed &s;tate of good and
ill, is a ble&s;&s;ing from heaven: the gift
of pre&s;cience would be a cur&s;e.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Fear.</HEAD>
<P>An unknown evil is the mo&s;t terrible.</P>
<P>Ignorance is the mother of fear, as
well as of admiration. A man intimate|ly
acquainted with the nature of things,
has &s;eldom occa&s;ion to be a&s;toni&s;hed.</P>
<P>Men of a fearful temper are prone to
&s;u&s;picion and cruelty.</P>
<P>Fear begets apprehen&s;ion, the parent
of &s;u&s;picion; and &s;u&s;picion begets ha|tred
and revenge.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20">There is &s;carce a pa&s;&s;ion but is able to
conquer the fear of death: revenge,
love, ambition, grief, all triumph over
it. Death, then, &s;hould be no &s;uch ter|rible
enemy, when it &s;ubmits to &s;o ma|ny
conquerors.</P>
<P>He mu&s;t fear many whom many fear.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="11" REF="19">
<HEAD>Chearfulne&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>A chearful countenance betokens a
good heart.</P>
<P>I love wi&s;dom that is gay and civili|zed.
Har&s;hne&s;s and au&s;terity are unna|tural,
and therefore to be &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>In the chearfulne&s;s of life, death is<MILESTONE N="21">
the lea&s;t terrible.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e gentlemen whom the world
for&s;ooth calls wi&s;e and &s;olid, there is
generally either a moro&s;ene&s;s that per|&s;ecutes,
or a dulne&s;s that tires you. If
the good &s;en&s;e they boa&s;t of, happen to
be &s;erviceable to you once in your life,
it is &s;o impertinent as to di&s;turb you e|very
day.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Mode&s;ty.</HEAD>
<P>It is pure hypoci&s;y in a man of qua|lity
to decline the place due to his rank:
it co&s;ts him nothing to take the lowe&s;t
&s;eat, when he is &s;ure the highe&s;t will be
pre&s;&s;ed upon him. Mode&s;ty &s;hows
<PB N="12" REF="20">
greater re&s;ignation in tho&s;e of middle
rank: if they throw them&s;elves among
the croud, if they take up with a di&s;ad|vantageous
&s;ituation, they are &s;ure to
remain there; they may be &s;queezed to
pieces, there is no mortal to take no|tice
of them.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Prudence.</HEAD>
<P>Few accidents are &s;o unhappy but
may be mended by prudence: few &s;o
happy but may be ruined by impru|dence.</P>
<P>Over-wary prudence is an invin|cible
ob&s;truction to great and hazardous
exploits.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Candour, Di&s;&s;imulation.</HEAD>
<P>It betokens as great a &s;oul to be ca|pable
of owning a fault, as to be inca|pable
of committing it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;tep toward vice is to make
a my&s;tery of what is innocent: who|ever
<PB N="13" REF="21">
loves to hide, will &s;oon or late have
rea&s;on to hide.</P>
<P>Hypocri&s;y is a homage that vice pays
to virtue.</P>
<P>It is more difficult to di&s;&s;emble the
&s;entiments one has, than to feign tho&s;e
he has not.</P>
<P>It is harder than is commonly thought,
to di&s;&s;emble with tho&s;e we de&s;pi&s;e.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Ambition.</HEAD>
<P>Ambition is one of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions<MILESTONE N="22">
that is never to be &s;atisfied. It &s;wells
gradually with &s;ucce&s;s; and every ac|qui&s;ition
&s;erves but as a &s;pur to further
attempts.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Pride.</HEAD>
<P>None are &s;o invincible as your half|witted
people: they know ju&s;t enough
to excite their pride, not enough to cure
it.</P>
<P>A proud man is like Nebuchadnezzar:
<PB N="14" REF="22">
he &s;ets up his image to be wor&s;hipped
by all.</P>
<P>A man of merit in place, is never
trouble&s;ome by his pride. He is not e|lated
with the po&s;t he fills, becau&s;e of a
greater he has not, of which he knows
him&s;elf worthy.</P>
<P>Anxiety and con&s;traint are the con|&s;tant
attendants of pride.</P>
<P>The &s;ame littlene&s;s of &s;oul that makes
a man de&s;pi&s;e inferiors, and trample on
them, makes him abjectly ob&s;equious to
&s;uperiors.</P>
<P>Pride, which rai&s;es a man in his own
opinion above his equals, is ea&s;ily di&s;|obliged,
but not ea&s;ily obliged; favours
from inferiors being conceived as duties,
omi&s;&s;ions as crimes. The vain are ea&s;i|ly
obliged, and as ea&s;ily di&s;obliged. It
is a rare ca&s;e to meet with one that is
ea&s;ily obliged, but not ea&s;ily di&s;obliged;
becau&s;e few have a le&s;s opinion of them|&s;elves
than they de&s;erve. To tho&s;e on|ly
it belongs who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho|rough
good &s;en&s;e, not to be ea&s;ily ob|liged
nor ea&s;ily di&s;obliged.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="23">
Pride is wor&s;e to bear than cruelty.</P>
<P>Pride, more than defect of judgment,
breeds oppo&s;ition to e&s;tabli&s;hed princi|ples.
We chu&s;e rather to lead than to
follow.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Vanity.</HEAD>
<P>Self-conceit is none of the &s;malle&s;t
ble&s;&s;ings from heaven.</P>
<P>Vanity, where it makes a man value
him&s;elf upon good actions, is no de&s;pi|cable
quality.</P>

the frequent di&s;appointments I mu&s;t

that grand colo&s;&s;us is no more to be

<P><MILESTONE N="115">Life is &s;hort and uncertain; we have

our weakne&s;s, we &s;tir up mighty

were invulnerable. Wherefore all this
bu&s;tle and noi&s;e? Fate hangs over us,
and charges to our account, even tho&s;e

forbear a moment, death is at hand,

<P>AT the &s;iege of Namur by the al|lies,
there were in the ranks of
the company commanded by
Captain Pincent, in Colonel Frederick
Hamilton's regiment, one Unnion, a
corporal, and one Valentine a private
centinel: there happened between the&s;e
two men a di&s;pute about a matter of
love, which, upon &s;ome aggravations,
grew to an irreconcileable hatred. Un|nion
being the officer of Valentine,
took all opportunities even to &s;trike his
rival, and profe&s;s the &s;pite and revenge
which moved him to it. The centinel
bore it without re&s;i&s;tance; but fre|quently
&s;aid he would die to be reven|ged
of that tyrant. They had &s;pent
whole months thus, one injuring, the o|ther
complaining; when in the mid&s;t of
this rage towards each other, they were
<PB N="102" REF="108">
commanded upon the attack of the ca|&s;tle;
where the corporal received a
&s;hot in the thigh, and fell. The French
pre&s;&s;ing on, and he expecting to be
trampled to death, called out to his e|nemy,
Ah, Valentine! can you leave
me here? Valentine immediately ran
back, and in the mid&s;t of a thick fire of
the French, took the corporal upon his
back, and brought him through all that
danger as far as the abbey of Sal&s;ine,
where a cannon-ball took off his head:
his body fell under his enemy whom he
was carrying off. Unnion immediate|ly
forgot his wound, ro&s;e up, tearing
his hair, and then threw him&s;elf upon
the bleeding carca&s;s, crying, Ah Valen|tine!
was it for me who have &s;o bar|barou&s;ly
u&s;ed thee, that thou ha&s;t died?
I will not live after thee. He was not
by any means to be forced from the bo|dy,
but was removed with it bleeding
in his arms, and attended with tears by
all their comrades, who knew their en|mity.
When he was brought to a tent,
his wounds were dre&s;&s;ed by force; but
<PB N="103" REF="109">
the next day, &s;till calling upon Valen|tine,

pomp, Diony&s;ius ordered a naked &s;word
to be hung from the ceiling, by a hor&s;e|hair,
directly over the royal throne,
where Damocles was &s;itting at a fea&s;t.
From that moment Damocles lo&s;t his
&s;tomach, his joy vani&s;hed, and he beg|ged
to be re&s;tored to the &s;ecurity of his
former condition. Diony&s;ius thus ta|citly

<P>Frein&s;hemius, in his &s;upplement to

Per&s;ians, who had been terrified with
the fortune and warlike preparations of
Philip of Macedon, were laid a&s;leep by
his death, contemning the youth and
inexperience of Alexander; but that
the repeated news of his victories drove

<P>It mu&s;t appear &s;ingular, that the Pa|ri&s;ians,

with &s;uch hatred again&s;t their lawful

Davila informs us, that it was a com|mon
practice among the German &s;oldiers
who guarded the town, to kill children

yielding, though they were offered all

&s;ecurity for their religion. The Duke
of Parma rai&s;ed the &s;iege; and after his
return to Flanders, the &s;iege was con|verted
into a blockade, which prevent|ing
any regular &s;upplies, reduced the
Pari&s;ians to con&s;iderable &s;traits, though
far from what they had formerly &s;uffer|ed.
It was during this time of mode|rate
per&s;ecution, that they lo&s;t courage,
became impatient, and were willing to
&s;ubmit upon any rea&s;onable terms.
When the town was vigorou&s;ly attack|ed,
the inhabitants were not le&s;s vigo|rous
in its defence, and their ob&s;tinacy
was inflamed by bigotry, and hatred to
the Reformed religion. During the
blockade, being &s;uffered to live idle,
they had nothing to animate their op|po&s;ition;
and as in the interval betwixt
the &s;iege and the blockade, they had ta|&s;ted
of plenty, they could not think
without abhorrence upon their former
mi&s;eries.</P>

<P>Topal O&s;man, who had received his
education in the &s;eraglio, being in the

was &s;ent with the Sultan's orders
to the Ba&s;haw of Cairo. He travelled
by land to <HI>Said;</HI> and being afraid of
the Arabs who rove about plundering
pa&s;&s;engers and caravans, he imbarked
on board a Turki&s;h ve&s;&s;el bound to Da|mietta,
a city on the Nile. In this
&s;hort pa&s;&s;age they were attacked by a
Spani&s;h privateer, and a bloody action
en&s;ued. Topal O&s;man gave here the
fir&s;t proofs of that intrepidity, by which
he was &s;o often &s;ignalized afterwards.
The crew, animated by his example,
fought with great bravery; but &s;upe|rior
numbers at la&s;t prevailed, and O&s;|man
was taken pri&s;oner, after being
dangerou&s;ly wounded in the arm and
thigh.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="138">
O&s;man's gallantry induced the Spa|ni&s;h
captain to pay him particular re|gard:
but his wounds were &s;till in a
bad way when he was carried to Malta,
whither the privateer went to refit.
The wound in his thigh was the mo&s;t
dangerous; and he was lame of it ever
after; for which he had the name of
<HI>Topal,</HI> or cripple.</P>
<P>At that time Vincent Arnaud, a na|tive
of Mar&s;eilles, was commander of
the port at Malta; who, as his bu&s;ine&s;s
required, went on board the privateer
&s;o &s;oon as &s;he came to anchor. O&s;man
no &s;ooner &s;aw Arnaud, than he &s;aid to
him, &startq;Can you do a generous and gal|lant
action? Ran&s;om me, and take
my word you &s;hall lo&s;e nothing by
it.&endq; Such a reque&s;t from a &s;lave in
chains was uncommon; but the manner
in which it was delivered, made an im|pre&s;&s;ion

turning to the captain of the privateer,
a&s;ked what he demanded for the ran|&s;om.
He an&s;wered 1000 &s;equins<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Near L. 500</NOTE>.
Arnaud turning to the Turk, &s;aid, &startq;I
<PB N="133" REF="139">

this (replied the Turk) with con&s;i&s;t|ency.
I am in chains, and therefore
try every method to recover my li|berty,
and you may have rea&s;on to
di&s;tru&s;t the word of a &s;tranger. I
have nothing at pre&s;ent but my word
to give you; nor do I pretend to a&s;|&s;ign
any rea&s;on why you &s;hould tru&s;t
to it. I can only &s;ay, that if you in|cline
to act a generous part, you &s;hall
have no rea&s;on to repent.&endq; The
commander upon this went to make
his report to the Grand Ma&s;ter Don
Perellos. The air with which O&s;man
delivered him&s;elf, wrought &s;o upon
Arnaud, that he returned immediately
on board the Spani&s;h ve&s;&s;el, and agreed
with the captain for 600 &s;equins, which
he paid as the price of O&s;man's liberty.
He put him on board a ve&s;&s;el of his
own, and provided him a &s;urgeon, with
every thing nece&s;&s;ary for his entertain|ment
and cure.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="140">
O&s;man had mentioned to his benefac|tor,
that he might write to Con&s;tanti|nople

but finding him&s;elf in the hands of a
man who had tru&s;ted &s;o much to his ho|nour,
he was emboldened to a&s;k ano|ther
favour; which was, to leave the
payment of the ran&s;om entirely to him.
Arnaud di&s;cerned, that in &s;uch a ca&s;e
things were not to be done by halves.
He agreed to the propo&s;al with a good
grace; and &s;hewed him every other
mark of genero&s;ity and friend&s;hip. Ac|cordingly
O&s;man, &s;o &s;oon as he was in
a condition, &s;et out again upon his voy|age.</P>
<P>The French colours now protected
him from the privateers. In a &s;hort
time he reached Damietta, and &s;ailed
up the Nile to Cairo. No &s;ooner was
he arrived there, than he delivered
1000 &s;equins to the ma&s;ter of the ve&s;|&s;el,
to be paid to his benefactor Ar|naud,
together with &s;ome rich furs;
and he gave to the ma&s;ter him&s;elf, five
hundred crowns as a pre&s;ent. He exe|cuted
<PB N="135" REF="141">
the orders of the Sultan his ma|&s;ter
with the Ba&s;ha of Cairo; and &s;et|ting
out for Con&s;tantinople, was the
fir&s;t who brought the news of his &s;lave|ry.</P>
<P>The favour received from Arnaud in
&s;uch circum&s;tances, made an impre&s;&s;ion
upon a generous mind, too deep ever
to be eradicated. During the whole
cour&s;e of his life, he did not cea&s;e, by
letters and other acknowledgements, to
te&s;tify his gratitude.</P>
<P>In the 1715, war was declared be|tween
the Venetians and Turks. The
Grand Vizir, who had projected the in|va&s;ion

army near the i&s;thmus of Co|rinth,
the only pa&s;s by which this pe|nin&s;ula
can be attacked by land. To|pal
O&s;man was charged with the com|mand
to force the pa&s;s; which he not
only executed &s;ucce&s;sfully, but after|wards
took the city of Corinth by a&s;|&s;ault.
For this &s;ervice he was reward|ed,
by being made a ba&s;ha of two tails.
The next year he &s;erved as lieutenant-general
<PB N="136" REF="142">
under the Grand Vizir, at the
&s;iege of Corfu, which the Turks were
obliged to abandon. O&s;man &s;taid three
days before the place, to &s;ecure and
conduct the retreat of the Ottoman
troops.</P>
<P>In the 1722, he was appointed Se|ra&s;kier<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">General in chief.</NOTE>, and had the command of the
army in the Morea. When the con|&s;uls
of the different nations came to pay
their re&s;pects to him in this quality, he
di&s;tingui&s;hed the French by peculiar
marks of kindne&s;s and protection. &startq;In|form

as it enables me to &s;erve him.
Let me have his &s;on in pledge of our
friend&s;hip; and I will charge my&s;elf
with making his fortune.&endq; Accord|ingly
Arnaud's &s;on went into the Mo|rea,
and the Sera&s;kier not only made
him pre&s;ents, but granted him privi|leges
and advantages in trade, which
&s;oon put him in a way of acquiring an
e&s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="143">
Topal O&s;man's parts and abilities
&s;oon rai&s;ed him to a greater command.
He was made a ba&s;ha of three tails, and
beglerbeg of Romania, one of the great|e&s;t
governments in the empire, and of
the greate&s;t importance by its vicinity
to Hungary.</P>
<P>His re&s;idence during his government
was at Ny&s;&s;a. In the year 1727, Vin|cent

him there, and were received
with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s. Laying
a&s;ide the ba&s;ha and governor, he em|braced
them, cau&s;ed them to be &s;erved
with &s;$erbet and perfumes, and made
them &s;it upon the &s;ame &s;opha with him|&s;elf;
an honour but rarely be&s;towed by
a ba&s;ha of the fir&s;t order, and hardly e|ver

being the highe&s;t in the Ottoman em|pire,
and perhaps the highe&s;t that any
&s;ubject in the world enjoys, is always
dangerous, and was then greatly &s;o.

from Malta, bringing with him
variety of pre&s;ents, and twelve Turks
whom he had ran&s;omed from &s;lavery.
The&s;e, by command of the Vizir, were
ranged in order before him. Vincent
Arnaud, now &s;eventy-two years of age,
with his &s;on, were brought before To|pal
O&s;man Grand Vizir of the Ottoman
<PB N="139" REF="145">
empire. He received them in the pre|&s;ence
of the great officers of &s;tate, with
the utmo&s;t marks of affection. Then
turning to tho&s;e about him, and point|ing
to the ran&s;omed Turks: &startq;Behold,&endq;
&s;ays he, &startq;the&s;e your brethren, now
enjoying the &s;weets of liberty, after
having groaned in &s;lavery: this
Frenchman is their deliverer. I was
my&s;elf a &s;lave; loaded with chains,
&s;treaming in blood, and covered with
wounds: this is the man who re|deemed
and &s;aved me; this is my
ma&s;ter and benefactor: to him I am
indebted for life, liberty, fortune,
and every thing I enjoy. Without
knowing me, he paid for me a large
ran&s;om, &s;ent me away upon my bare
word, and gave me a &s;hip to carry
me. Where is ever a Mu&s;&s;ulman
capable of &s;uch genero&s;ity?&endq;</P>
<P>While O&s;man was &s;peaking, all eyes
were fixed upon Arnauld, who held the
Grand Vizir's hands clo&s;ely locked be|tween
his own. The Vizir then a&s;ked
both father and &s;on many que&s;tions con|cerning
<PB N="140" REF="146">
their &s;ituation and fortune,
heard their an&s;wers with kindne&s;s and
attention, and then ended with an Ara|bic
&s;entence, ALLAH KERIM<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The providence of God is great.</NOTE>. He
made before them the di&s;tribution of
the pre&s;ents they had brought, the great|e&s;t
part of which he &s;ent to the Sultan,
the Sultana mother, and the Ki&s;lar
Aga<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chief of the black eu$$chs.</NOTE>. Upon which the two French|men
made their obei&s;ance, and retired.</P>
<P>After this ceremony was over, the &s;on
of the Grand Vizir took them to his a|partments,
where he treated them with
great kindne&s;s. Some time before they
left Con&s;tantinople, they had a confer|ence
in private with the Vizir, who di|ve&s;ted
him&s;elf of all &s;tate and ceremony.
He let them under&s;tand, that the na|ture
of his &s;ituation would not permit
him to do as he de&s;ired, &s;ince a mini|&s;ter
ever appears in the eyes of many,
to do nothing without a view to his
own particular intere&s;t; adding, that a
<PB N="141" REF="147">
ba&s;haw was lord and ma&s;ter in his own
province, but that the Grand Vizir at
Con&s;tantinople had a ma&s;ter greater
than him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He cau&s;ed them to be amply paid for
the ran&s;om of the Turks, and likewi&s;e
procured them payment of a debt which
they had looked on as de&s;perate. He
al&s;o made them large pre&s;ents in money,
and gave them an order for taking a
loading of corn at Salonica; which was
likely to be very profitable, as the ex|portation
of corn from that part had
been for a long time prohibited.</P>
<P>As his gratitude was without bounds,
his liberality was the &s;ame. His beha|viour
to his benefactor demon&s;trated
that greatne&s;s of &s;oul, which di&s;played
it&s;elf in every action of his life. And
this behaviour mu&s;t appear the more
generous, when it is con&s;idered, what
contempt and aver&s;ion the prejudices of
education create in a Turk again&s;t Chri|&s;tians.</P>

<P>In that notable victory which Cyrus
<PB N="148" REF="154">
the Per&s;ian obtained over the A&s;&s;yrians,
Panthea, wife to Abradatas King of the
Su&s;ians, was made a captive; and being
a lady reckoned the mo&s;t beautiful of
A&s;ia, was re&s;erved for Cyrus, by his
captains. Her hu&s;band was not in the
battle, being employed to treat of an
alliance betwixt the A&s;&s;yrians and the
King of Bactria. Cyrus, calling to him
Ara&s;pes, the companion of his youth,
recommended Panthea to his care.
Have you &s;een this woman, O Cyrus,
&s;aid Ara&s;pes? Cyrus an&s;wered, No.
But I did, replied he. When we cho&s;e
her for you, &s;he was &s;itting in her tent,
without any di&s;tingui&s;hing mark or ha|bit,
&s;urrounded by her women. But,
de&s;irous to know which was the mi&s;tre&s;s,
we immediately found her out, though
covered with a veil, and looking on the
ground. She got up to receive us, and
we perceived that &s;he excelled in &s;ta|ture,
in grace, and beautiful &s;hape. The
elde&s;t among us addre&s;&s;ed her in the fol|lowing
words. &startq;Take courage, wo|man.
We have heard that your hu&s;|band
<PB N="149" REF="155">
is a brave man: but now you
are re&s;erved for one not inferior to
him, in per&s;on, under&s;tanding, or
power; for if there be in the world
who de&s;erves admiration, Cyrus is the
man, and to him you are de&s;tined.&endq;
The woman, hearing this, tore her
robe, and, accompanied with her &s;er|vants,
&s;et up a lamentable cry. Upon
this, part of her face was di&s;covered,
and her neck and hands. And be it
known to you, Cyrus, that we all
thought never was produced &s;uch an|other
woman. Therefore, by all means,
you mu&s;t &s;ee her. Cyrus an&s;wered,
That now he was re&s;olved again&s;t it.
Why &s;o? &s;aid the young man. Becau&s;e,
&s;aid Cyrus, if, upon hearing from you
that &s;he is hand&s;ome, I am per&s;uaded to
&s;ee her, I am afraid I &s;hall be more ea&s;ily
tempted to &s;ee her a &s;econd time, and
perhaps come to neglect my affairs,
and &s;it gazing on her. Ara&s;pes &s;miling,
Do you think, Cyrus, that beauty can
nece&s;&s;itate one to act contrary to rea&s;on?
If this were naturally &s;o, all would be
<PB N="150" REF="156">
under the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity. But of beau|ties,
&s;ome in&s;pire love, &s;ome not; for
love is voluntary, and every man loves
whom he plea&s;es. How comes it then
to pa&s;s, replied Cyrus, if love be volun|tary,
that one cannot give it over when
he inclines? I have &s;een per&s;ons in
grief and tears upon account of love,
wi&s;hing to be rid of it as of any other di&s;|temper,
and yet bound by a &s;tronger
tie of nece&s;&s;ity than if bound in iron
chains. The young man to this &s;aid,
There are indeed examples of this kind;
but &s;uch are mi&s;erable wretches; for
though they are always wi&s;hing them|&s;elves
dead, as unhappy, yet they ne|ver
think of parting with life. Ju&s;t
&s;uch wretches are they who commit
theft; and yet, O Cyrus, I ob&s;erve that
you treat the&s;e with great &s;everity, as
reckoning theft no &s;uch fatal nece&s;&s;ary
thing. So per&s;ons that are beautiful do
not nece&s;&s;itate others to love them, or
to covet what they ought not. Weak
men, impotent in mind, are &s;laves to
their pa&s;&s;ions; and to excu&s;e them&s;elves,
<PB N="151" REF="157">
accu&s;e love. But the firm and re&s;olute,
though fond of gold, fine hor&s;es, beau|tiful
women, can with ea&s;e ab&s;tain, &s;o
as to do nothing contrary to right. I,
who have &s;een this woman, and think
her extremely beautiful, remain not|with&s;tanding
free, and ready in all re|&s;pects
to perform my duty. But per|haps,
&s;aid Cyrus, you retired before
the time that love naturally lays hold of
a man. It is the nature of fire not in|&s;tantly
to burn; yet am I not willing,
either to meddle with fire, or to look
on beautiful per&s;ons. Be ea&s;y, &s;aid
he, Cyrus: though I look on Panthea
without cea&s;ing, I will not be &s;o con|quered,
as to do any thing I ought not.
You &s;peak, &s;aid Cyrus, hand&s;omely:
be careful of the woman, for &s;he may
be of &s;ervice to us in &s;ome future exi|gency.
And thus they parted.</P>
<P>Ara&s;pes, partly by conver&s;ing with a
woman not le&s;s wi&s;e than beautiful,
partly by &s;tudying to &s;erve and plea&s;e
her, partly by her gratitude when he
was &s;ick, and her anxiety for his reco|very;
<PB N="152" REF="158">
&mdash;by all the&s;e means, he was
made her captive in love. He ventu|red
to open his heart to her; but with|out
&s;ucce&s;s: for &s;he had the warme&s;t
affection for her hu&s;band. Yet &s;he for|bore
complaining to Cyrus, being un|willing
to hurt Ara&s;pes. Ara&s;pes be|gan
to think of force; for his pa&s;&s;ion
was now too violent to be re&s;trained.
Upon this, Panthea, apprehen&s;ive of
the con&s;equences, was no longer &s;ilent:
&s;he &s;ent an eunuch to Cyrus to inform
him of her danger. Cyrus, laughing
at the man who thought him&s;elf above
the power of love, commanded his
chief mini&s;ter to tell Ara&s;pes, That if
he could prevail by per&s;ua&s;ion, it was
well; but that by no means was he to
think of force. The mini&s;ter u&s;ed no
tenderne&s;s in delivering the commi&s;|&s;ion;
he accu&s;ed Ara&s;pes as a betrayer
of his tru&s;t, reproaching him for his
inju&s;tice, and impotence of pa&s;&s;ion.
The young man, &s;truck to the heart,
&s;hed many tears. Cyrus &s;ending for
him, I &s;ee, Ara&s;pes, &s;aid he, that you
<PB N="153" REF="159">
are overwhelmed with fear and &s;hame;
but be comforted, for I have read, that
the gods them&s;elves have been conquer|ed
by love. The wi&s;e&s;t of men are not
exempted from this pa&s;&s;ion; and I pro|nounced
upon my&s;elf, that if I conver|&s;ed
with beautiful women, I was not
enough my own ma&s;ter to di&s;regard
them. It is I that am the cau&s;e of your
misfortune, by &s;hutting you up with
this irre&s;i&s;tible beauty. Ara&s;pes warm|ly
replied, You are in this, O Cyrus,
as in other matters, mild, and di&s;po|&s;ed
to pardon the failings of men. But
how &s;hall I hold up after this mi&s;car|riage?
My friends will neglect me, and
my enemies triumph over me. Cyrus
&s;aid, Agreeable to me is thy &s;orrow, O
Ara&s;pes: lives there a mortal without
failings? Happy he who profits by
them.</P>
<P>Panthea, charmed with this conduct
in Cyrus, and admiring his excellent
qualifications, endeavoured to gain her
hu&s;band Abradatas to his &s;ide. She
knew there was no cordiality betwixt
<PB N="154" REF="160">
him and the King of A&s;&s;yria. That
prince had attempted to take Panthea
from him; and Abradatas, con&s;ider|ing
him as an unju&s;t man, wi&s;hed no|thing
more earne&s;tly, than an opportu|nity
to quit his &s;ervice. For this rea|&s;on
he li&s;tened to the &s;olicitations of
his wife; and came over to Cyrus with
two thou&s;and hor&s;e. Panthea inform|ed
him of the virtue of Cyrus, and of
his tender regard for her. What can
I do Panthea, &s;aid Abradatas, to &s;how
my gratitude to Cyrus? What el&s;e,
&s;aid &s;he, but to behave towards him as
he has behaved towards you? Upon
this, Abradatas, coming to Cyrus, and
taking him by the hand, &s;aid, O Cyrus,
in return for the benefits you have be|&s;towed
upon us, I give my&s;elf to you,
an ally, a &s;ervant, and a friend.</P>
<P>From that time Cyrus had no ally
more attached to his intere&s;t than Abra|datas.
The morning of that day in
which Cyrus overthrew Croe&s;us, Pan|thea
brought to her hu&s;band preparing
for the battle, a golden helmet, brace|lets
<PB N="155" REF="161">
for his wri&s;t&s;, a purple robe, and
a cre&s;t of a violet colour. The&s;e things
having been prepared without his know|ledge,
he &s;aid to her, Have you made
me the&s;e arms, Panthea, by de&s;troying
your own ornaments? No, &s;urely, &s;aid
&s;he, not by de&s;troying what is the mo&s;t
valuable of them; for you are my great|e&s;t
ornament. Proceeding to put on
the armour, tears trickled down her
cheeks, though &s;he endeavoured to re|&s;train
them. Abradatas, in this dre&s;s,
appeared mo&s;t beautiful and noble.
Panthae, after de&s;iring all that were
pre&s;ent to retire, &s;poke as follows. &startq;O
Abradatas! if ever there were a wo|man
who regarded her hu&s;band more
than her own &s;oul, you know that I
am &s;he. And yet though I &s;tand thus
affected toward you, I &s;wear by our
mutual friend&s;hip, that rather would
I be put under ground with you,
approving your&s;elf a brave man, than
live with you in di&s;regard and &s;hame.
We both lie under great obligations
to Cyrus, that when I was a captive,
<PB N="156" REF="162">
and cho&s;en for him&s;elf, he kept me
for you, as if I were his brother's
wife.&endq; Abradatas, &s;truck with ad|miration
at her di&s;cour&s;e, gently took
her hand into his, and lifting up his
eyes to heaven, made the following
prayer, &startq;Do thou, O great Jupiter,
grant me to appear a hu&s;band wor|thy
of Panthea, and a friend worthy
of Cyrus!&endq; and having &s;aid thus, he
mounted his chariot, and moved along.
She could not refrain from following,
till Abradatas, &s;eeing her, &s;aid, Have
courage, Panthea, the gods take care
of the virtuous: and upon this &s;he was
conducted to her tent. Though Abra|datas
in his chariot made a noble ap|pearance,
yet he drew no eyes till Pan|thea
was gone.</P>
<P>The victory that day was complete:
Cyrus routed his enemies, and got po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of their camp. Toward the e|vening,
when the battle was over, Cy|rus,
calling &s;ome of his &s;ervants, in|quired,
whether any of them had &s;een
Abradatas? But Abradatas was now
<PB N="157" REF="163">
no more! he was &s;lain, breaking in up|on
the Egyptians. All his followers,
except &s;ome tru&s;ty companions, had
turned their backs when they &s;aw the
compact body of the enemy. And Cy|rus
was informed, that Panthea had re|tired
with the dead body to the bank of
the river Pactolus; that her &s;ervants
were digging a grave for it; and that
&s;he her&s;elf was &s;itting upon the ground
with the head of her dead hu&s;band up|on
her knees. Cyrus, hearing this,
&s;mote his brea&s;t, and ha&s;tened to Pan|thea.
Seeing Abradatas lying dead, he
&s;hed tears, and &s;aid, Alas, thou brave
and faithful &s;oul! ha&s;t thou left us, and
art no more? At the &s;ame time he took
him by the right hand, which came a|way,
for it had been cut off in battle.
The woman, &s;mothering her grief, took
the hand from Cyrus, ki&s;&s;ed it, join|ed
it to the body, and &s;aid, The re&s;t,
Cyrus, is in the &s;ame condition. But
why &s;hould you look upon this mang|led
body? for you are not le&s;s affected
than I am. &startq;Fool that I was! fre|quently
<PB N="158" REF="164">
did I exhort him to &s;how his
friend&s;hip for you; and I know he
never thought of what he him&s;elf
might &s;uffer, but of what he &s;hould
do to gain your favour. He died,
therefore, without reproach, and I,
who urged him on, &s;it here alive.&endq;
Cyrus, &s;hedding tears, &s;poke thus: &startq;He
has died, O woman! but his death
has been glorious, for he has van|qui&s;hed
his enemies. Honours &s;hall
be paid him &s;uiting a conqueror. A
lofty monument &s;hall be erected for
him; and all the &s;acrifices &s;hall be
made that are due to the memory of
a brave man.&endq; Having &s;aid this, he
went away, with great concern for the
woman who had lo&s;t &s;uch a hu&s;band;
&s;orrowing al&s;o for the man who had
left &s;uch a wife behind him, never to
&s;ee her more.</P>
<P>The woman ordered her eunuchs to
retire, till &s;uch time, &s;aid &s;he, as I have
lamented over my hu&s;band. She retain|ed
only one faithful attendant, com|manding,
that when &s;he was dead, &s;he
<PB N="159" REF="165">

<P>Mele&s;ichton, born at Megara, of il|lu&s;trious

him&s;elf in &s;everal expeditions, was in
<PB N="171" REF="177">
the mid&s;t of every dangerous attempt,
and came ever off victorious. Being
highly e&s;teemed by his fellow-citizens,
he was cho&s;en their general; and &s;hew|ed
him&s;elf greater by his conduct, than
formerly by his courage. His ambition
was inflamed; power corrupted his
mind, and he aimed at no le&s;s than the
&s;overeignty, being unable to obey whom
he had &s;o long commanded. Thus,
from an u&s;eful member of the &s;tate, he
became a dangerous enemy. Lu&s;t of
rule threw down him, whom courage
and conduct had rai&s;ed. He was depri|ved
of all his employments, and a law
was made, that he &s;hould not thereafter
bear any command in the city. This
change of fortune threw him into de|&s;pair:
and to avoid di&s;grace, he retired
to the country with his wife and family.
His ambition had made him neglect mo|ney,
and his inclination to magnifi|cence
had di&s;&s;ipated the bulk of his pa|ternal
e&s;tate. All that he had remain|ing,
was a &s;mall farm in a remote cor|ner.
<PB N="172" REF="178">
There he &s;hut him&s;elf up out of
the eye of the world.</P>
<P>His wife Praxinoe had &s;pirit and re&s;o|lution.
Her beauty and birth had made
her the object of many vows, but &s;he
had preferred Mele&s;ichton purely for his
merit. Mutual affection, which had
made this couple happy for many years,
occa&s;ioned now their greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s.
Mele&s;ichton imagined that he could bear
&s;ingly the greate&s;t misfortunes, but he
could not bear to &s;ee Praxinoe reduced
to poverty. Praxinoe, on the other
hand, was in de&s;pair to find that &s;he
contributed to her hu&s;band's affliction.
Their children, a boy and a girl, were
their only remaining c&ograve;mfort. Meli|beus,
the &s;on, began early to &s;how
&s;trength, addre&s;s, and courage. In
this &s;olitude, his father had lei&s;ure to
teach him every le&s;&s;on for cultivating
and adorning the mind. Melibeus had
an air, &s;imple, &s;weet, and ingenuous,
mixed with firmne&s;s and elevation. Me|le&s;ichton,
beholding him, could &s;eldom
refrain from tears. His own misfor|tunes
<PB N="173" REF="179">
he con&s;idered as nothing; but
it &s;tung him to the heart that they
&s;hould be extended to his children. Da|maeta,
the daughter, was in&s;tructed by
her mother in all the arts of Minerva.
She was &s;killed in mu&s;ic, and her voice
was accompanied with the lyre, more
moving than that of Orpheus. Her hair
hung waving in the wind without any
ornament. She was dre&s;&s;ed in a plain
robe, borne up with with a girdle, which
made her motions perfectly ea&s;y. With|out
dre&s;s, &s;he had beauty; and knew it
not, having never even thought of
viewing her&s;elf in a fountain. The fa|ther,
in the mean time, full of di&s;con|tent,
delivered him&s;elf up to de&s;pair.
His frequented walk was on the &s;ea|&s;hore,
at the foot of an impending rock.
There he would often retire from his
family to deplore his misfortunes. He
never &s;poke but in &s;ighs; he neglected
the cares of life, enervated and &s;unk in
black melancholy.</P>
<P>One day, overcome with wearine&s;s

Her head was crowned with golden ears
of corn. She &s;poke to him with &s;weet|ne&s;s

to be &s;ubdued by the rigours of
fortune? Doth true nobility con&s;i&s;t in
riches? Doth it not con&s;i&s;t in a firm|ne&s;s

render them&s;elves mi&s;erable, by in|dolence
and fal&s;e glory. If nece&s;&s;aries
be wanting, would you owe them to
others rather than to your&s;elf? Con|tent

little by your work; free your&s;elf from

Bacchus appeared crowned with
ivy. Pan followed playing on a flute,
with the fawns and &s;atyrs dancing around.
Pomona pre&s;ented a lapful of fruits; and

The&s;e field-divinities, all of
them, threw a favourable regard upon

<P><PB N="175" REF="181">
He awaked, and was comforted. He
talked of his dream to Praxinoe. They
perceived contentment within their
reach, and began to ta&s;te rural plea&s;ures.
Nothing was now to be &s;een in the fami|ly
but a face of chearful indu&s;try. Praxi|noe
and Damaeta applied them&s;elves to
&s;pinning. They had herbs from a &s;mall
garden, and milk from a large flock.
Their food was dre&s;&s;ed up with clean|ne&s;s
and propriety. It was &s;imple, na|tural,
and good, &s;ea&s;oned with an ap|petite
in&s;eparable from temperance and
travail. Their hou&s;e was neat: the ta|pe&s;tries
were &s;old, but the walls were
white and clean. Their beds were not rich,
but they were not the le&s;s decent, and
ea&s;y. The kitchen it&s;elf had an elegance
not to be &s;een in great hou&s;es, every
thing in it &s;hining, and in its proper
place. To regale the family upon ex|traordinary
occa&s;ions, Praxinoe produ|ced
honey, and the fine&s;t fruits. She
cultivated a flower-garden, &s;old part,
and re&s;erved part to adorn her hou&s;e.
Damaeta imitated her mother. She
<PB N="176" REF="182">
went about &s;inging at her work. Her
tender lambs danced upon the green,
and the echoes around repeated her
notes. Agriculture was Mele&s;ichton's
province. He him&s;elf held the plough,
&s;owed the grain, and attended the reap|ers.
He found &s;uch labours more inno|cent
than tho&s;e of war. He planted a
vineyard, and had wine to entertain
his gue&s;ts. Winter, the &s;ea&s;on of
repo&s;e, was dedicated to &s;ocial inter|cour&s;e
and innocent amu&s;ement. Me|le&s;ichton
thanked the gods for opening
his eyes. He was now &s;en&s;ible of the
fal&s;e lu&s;tre of ambition and greatne&s;s;
and he was entirely &s;atisfied with his pre|&s;ent
lot. In Melibeus, occupation and toil
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed youthful pa&s;&s;ions. The orchard
was his care; he planted trees, and nur&s;ed
them up. He brought a canal of water
into the garden, which he divided into
many rills. His father had in&s;pired him
with a ta&s;te for reading; and in the inter|vals
of work, his diver&s;ions were hunt|ing,
running, and wre&s;tling with the
neighbouring youth.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="183">
Mele&s;ichton, now accu&s;tomed to a life
of &s;implicity, found him&s;elf more at ea&s;e,
than in his wonted grandeur. The ne|ce&s;&s;aries
of life he had in abundance, and
he de&s;ired nothing beyond. The plea|&s;ures
of &s;ociety he ta&s;ted in his own fa|mily.
Love and tenderne&s;s united them
intimately, and be&s;towed &s;incere happi|ne&s;s.
At a di&s;tance from court, they
were ignorant of its giddy plea&s;ures,
dangerous in the fruition, and &s;till more
dangerous in the con&s;equences. Their
plea&s;ures were &s;weet, innocent, &s;imple,
and always within reach. Plenty once a|gain
vi&s;ited this family; but pride and
ambition returned no more.</P>
<P>All the world &s;aid to Mele&s;ichton,
&startq;Riches are returned, it is time to re|turn

with regard to him&s;elf, was
thoroughly mortified: but he e&s;teemed
his children, and thought them quali|fied

Falling in&s;en&s;ibly a&s;leep, the godde&s;s

True dignity flows from independ|ence,

<P>Di&s;contented with his pre&s;ent lot, a
certain man was always at his prayers
for better fortune. Jupiter in good
humour tran&s;ports him into the cele|&s;tial
magazines, where a number of
bags &s;ealed by the de&s;tinies, were ran|ged
in order, containing all the differ|ent
fortunes of men. Here, &s;ays Ju|piter,
your lot is in your hand: but to
regulate your choice, know that the
mo&s;t fortunate lots weigh the lea&s;t;
misfortunes only are heavy. Thanks
to Jupiter, replies our man, I &s;hall now
be happy. He lays hold of the fir&s;t
bag, that of kings, covering cruel cares
under an external pomp. Oh ho! &s;ays
<PB N="181" REF="187">
he, that man mu&s;t be vigorous indeed
who bears &s;o heavy a burden. Throw|ing
it a&s;ide, he weighs a &s;econd, the
bag of the great, and of men in place.
There lie anxiety and profound medi|tation,
the thir&s;t of power, the terror
of di&s;grace. Mi&s;erable they to whom
this lot belongs! cries our man: may
heaven pre&s;erve me from it. He goes
on weighing bags without end, finding
them all too heavy, &s;ome by &s;ad con|finement,
&s;ome by unbounded de&s;ires,
&s;ome by envy and fear, and &s;ome mere|ly
by the &s;atiety of plea&s;ure. At la&s;t he
&s;tumbled on the lot that plea&s;ed him:
This, &s;ays he, weighs not &s;o much. And
it would weigh &s;till le&s;s, &s;ays the god,
if it did not belong to one who is ig|norant
of its value. I am not &s;uch a
changeling, &s;ays the man, let it be
mine. But you are ignorant of its va|lue,
&s;ays Jupiter, for it is the very lot
you have all along been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of.
Farewell; but learn by this trial to be
&s;atisfied with it.</P>

his native country with a con&s;iderable
&s;tock, and &s;et up as a banker in Madrid.
In his ab&s;ence his parents frequently
talked of him, praying fervently that
Heaven would take him under its pro|tection;
<PB N="193" REF="199">
and the vicar being their-friend,
gave them frequently the public prayers
of the congregation for him. The
banker was not le&s;s dutiful on his part;
for &s;o &s;oon as he was &s;ettled, he mounted
on hor&s;eback, and went alone to the
village. It was ten at night before he
got there; and the hone&s;t cobler was a|bed
with his wife in a &s;ound &s;leep when
he knocked at the door. Open the
door, &s;ays the banker, 'tis your &s;on
Francillo. Make others believe that if
you can, cried the old man, &s;tarting
from his &s;leep; go about your bu&s;ine&s;s,
you thieving rogues, here is nothing
for you: Francillo, if not dead, is now
in the Indies. He is no longer there,
replied the banker, he is returned home,
and it is he who now &s;peaks to you:
open your door, and receive him. Ja|cobo,
&s;aid the woman, let us ri&s;e then;
for I really believe 'tis Francillo, I think
I know his voice. The father &s;tarting
from bed, lighted a candle, and the mo|ther
putting on her gown in a hurry, o|pened
the door. Looking earne&s;tly on
<PB N="194" REF="200">
Francillo, &s;he flung her arms about his
neck, and hugged him with the utmo&s;t

his turn; and all three, tran&s;ported with
joy after &s;o long ab&s;ence, had no end in
expre&s;&s;ing their tenderne&s;s. After the&s;e
plea&s;ing tran&s;ports, the banker put his
hor&s;e into the &s;table, where he found
an old milch-cow, nur&s;e to the whole
family. He then gave the old folks an
account of his voyage, and of all the
riches he had brought from Peru. They
li&s;tened greedily, and every the lea&s;t
particular of his relation made on them
a &s;en&s;ible impre&s;&s;ion of grief or joy.
Having fini&s;hed his &s;tory, he offered
them a part of his e&s;tate, and intreated
his father not to work any more. No,
my &s;on, &s;aid Jacobo, I love my trade,
and will not leave it off. Why, repli|ed
the banker, is it not now high time for
you to take your ea&s;e? I do not propo&s;e
your living with me at Madrid: I
know well that a city-life would not plea&s;e
you: enjoy your own way of living;
but give over your hard labour, and pa&s;s
<PB N="195" REF="201">
the remainder of your days in ea&s;e and
plenty. The mother &s;econded her &s;on,
and Jacobo yielded. To plea&s;e you,
Francillo, &s;aid he, I will not work any
more for the public, but will only mend
my own &s;hoes, and tho&s;e of my good
friend the vicar. This agreement being
concluded, the banker eat a couple of
eggs, and &s;lept in the &s;ame bed with his
father and mother, enjoying that kindly
&s;atisfaction which none but dutiful chil|dren
can feel or under&s;tand. The next
morning the banker, leaving his parents
a pur&s;e of three hundred ducats, return|ed
to Madrid: but was much &s;urpri&s;ed

thereafter. My father, &s;aid he, what

<P>Ned Froth, who had been &s;everal
years butler in a $amily of di&s;tinction,
having &s;aved about four hundred pounds,
took a little hou&s;e in the &s;uburbs, and
laid in a &s;tock of liquors for which he
paid ready money, and which were,
therefore, the be&s;t of the kind. Ned
perceived his trade increa&s;e: he pur|&s;ued
it with fre&s;h alacrity, he exulted
in his &s;ucce&s;s, and the joy of his heart
&s;parkled in his countenance. But it hap|pened
that Ned, in the mid&s;t of his hap|pine&s;s
and pro&s;perity, was prevailed
upon to buy a lottery-ticket. The mo|ment
his hope was fixed upon an ob|ject
which indu&s;try could not obtain,
he determined to be indu&s;trious no
longer: to draw drink for a dirty and
<PB N="202" REF="208">
boi&s;terous rabble, was a &s;lavery to which
he now &s;ubmitted with reluctance, and
he longed for the moment in which he
&s;hould be free: in&s;tead of telling his
&s;tory, and cracking his joke for the en|tertainment
of his cu&s;tomers, he recei|ved
them with indifference, was ob&s;er|ved
to be &s;ilent and &s;ullen, and amu&s;ed
him&s;elf by going three or four times a|day
to &s;earch the regi&s;ter of fortune for
the &s;ucce&s;s of his ticket.</P>
<P>In this di&s;po&s;ition Ned was &s;itting one
morning in the corner of a bench by his
fire-&s;ide, wholly ab&s;tracted in the con|templation
of his future fortune; in|dulging
this moment the hope of a mere
po&s;&s;ibility, and the next &s;huddering with
the dread of lo&s;ing the felicity which
his fancy had combined with the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of ten thou&s;and pounds. A man
well dre&s;&s;ed entered ha&s;tily, and inqui|red
for him of his gue&s;ts, who many
times called him aloud by his name,
and cur&s;t him for his deafne&s;s and &s;tupi|dity,
before Ned &s;tarted up as from a
dream, and a&s;ked with a fretful impa|tience
<PB N="203" REF="209">
what they wanted. An affected
confidence of being well received, and
an air of forced jocularity in the &s;tranger,
gave Ned &s;ome offence; but the next
moment he catched him in his arms in
a tran&s;port of joy, upon receiving his
congratulation as proprietor of the for|tunate
ticket, which had that morning
been drawn a prize of the fir&s;t cla&s;s.</P>
<P>It was not, however, long, before
Ned di&s;covered that ten thou&s;and pounds
did not bring the felicity which he ex|pected;
a di&s;covery which generally
produces the di&s;&s;ipation of &s;udden af|fluence
by prodigality. Ned drank, and
whored, and hired fidlers, and bought
fine cloaths; he bred riots at Vauxhall,
treated flatterers, and damned plays.
But &s;omething was &s;till wanting; and
he re&s;olved to &s;trike a bold &s;troke, and
attempt to double the remainder of his
prize at play, that he might live in a
palace, and keep an equipage: but in
the execution of this project, he lo&s;t the
whole produce of his lottery-ticket, ex|cept
five hundred pounds in bank-notes,
<PB N="204" REF="210">
which when he would have &s;taked he
could not find. This &s;um was more
than that which had e&s;tabli&s;hed him in
the trade he had left; and yet, with the
power of returning to a &s;tation that was
once the utmo&s;t of his ambition, and
of renewing that pur&s;uit which alone
had made him happy, &s;uch was the pun|gency
of his regret, that in the de&s;pair
of recovering the money which he knew
had produced nothing but riot, di&s;ea&s;e,
and vexation, he threw him&s;elf from
the bridge into the Thames.</P>

<P>Archytas Tarentinus returning from

A &s;oldier returning from fo|rage
without his companion, of whom
he gave no &s;atisfactory account, Pi&s;o,
taking it for granted that he had mur|dered
his companion, condemned him
in&s;tantly to death. The &s;entence was
at the very point of being executed,
when, behold! the wandering compa|nion
arrived, which filled all hearts
with joy. They were carried in&s;tantly
to Pi&s;o, not doubting but that the &s;en|tence
would be recalled. But &s;hame
for being in the wrong rekindled Pi|&s;o's
rage, which made him incapable of
acknowledging his ra&s;hne&s;s; and, as if
per&s;everance would ju&s;tify a wrong, or
hide it from others, he committed an|other
act of inju&s;tice, much le&s;s excu|&s;able
than the former. The fir&s;t &s;ol|dier
was ordered to death, becau&s;e &s;en|tence

afterwards, that Cinna was a young
man of an illu&s;trious family, and ne|phew
to the great Pompey, he broke
out into bitter fits of pa&s;&s;ion: &startq;Why
live I, if it be for the good of ma|ny
that I &s;hould die? Mu&s;t there be
no end of my cruelties? Is my life of
&s;o great value, that oceans of blood

Lepidus has followed Savidienus,
Murena Lepidus, Caepio Murena,

may not &s;ucceed. Cinna is
detected: forgive him; he will ne|ver
henceforth have the heart to hurt
thee; and it will be an act of glory.&endq;
Augu&s;tus was a man of &s;en&s;e. He re|li&s;hed
the advice, and calling Cinna to
a private conference, he &s;poke as fol|lows:
&startq;Thou knowe&s;t, Cinna, that
having joined my enemies, I gave
thee thy life, re&s;tored thee all thy
goods, and advanced thy fortune e|qually
with the be&s;t of tho&s;e who had
always been my friends. The &s;acer|dotal
office I conferred upon thee, af|ter
having denied it to others, who
had borne arms in my &s;ervice. And
yet, after &s;o many obligations, thou
<PB N="215" REF="221">
ha&s;t undertaken to murder me.&endq; See|ing
Cinna a&s;toni&s;hed, and &s;ilent, with the
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt, he went on as
follows. &startq;Well! Cinna, go thy way;
I again give thee that life as a traitor
and a parricide, which I before gave
thee as an enemy. Let friend&s;hip
from this time forward commence
betwixt us; and let us make it ap|pear,
whether thou ha&s;t received thy
life, or I have given it, with the bet|ter
faith.&endq; Some time after, he pre|ferred
Cinna to the con&s;ular dignity,
complaining that he had not re&s;olution
to demand it. Their friend&s;hip conti|nued
uninterrupted till Cinna's death;
who, in token of his gratitude, ap|pointed
Augu&s;tus to be his &s;ole heir.
And it is remarkable, that Augu&s;tus
reaped the due reward of a clemency &s;o
generous and exemplary; for from that
time there never was the &s;lighte&s;t con|&s;piracy
or attempt again&s;t him.</P>

in love: In &s;entiment? that may be:
one was for the fair beauty, another for
the brown; one dealt in pro&s;e, another
in ver&s;e; which occa&s;ioned frequent di&s;|putes
to &s;ea&s;on their conver&s;ation. One
day a favourite topic was &s;tarted: they
took &s;ides, grew warm; nothing but
noi&s;e in&s;tead of rea&s;on. At la&s;t they
parted almo&s;t in bad humour; and at
that in&s;tant &s;carce believed them&s;elves
friends. After a calm was re&s;tored,
Gentlemen, &s;ays one, how happy would
it be for friends to be all of one mind?
They at once agreed upon a &s;upplica|tion
to the gods, to remove their only
cau&s;e of di&s;cord, by giving them one
mind, as they had one heart. They
marched in a body to the temple of A|pollo,
and pre&s;ented their humble re|que&s;t.
The god inclined his ear, ex|erted
his power, and, in the twinkling
<PB N="242" REF="248">
of an eye, moulded their minds into
one. From that moment their thoughts,
their de&s;ires, their &s;entiments were the
&s;ame. If one made an ob&s;ervation, all
a&s;&s;ented: if another declared his opi|nion,
the re&s;t gave a nod. Good! &s;aid
they, behold our di&s;putes and our ill
blood are at an end. Very true: but
are not the charms of conver&s;ation at
an end al&s;o? no beautiful reflections, no
warm &s;entiments, &s;parks of fire &s;truck
out by oppo&s;ition, enlightening the
mind, chearing the heart, and making
time pa&s;s &s;weetly. <HI>Yes</HI> is now the on|ly
word: friend&s;hip decays, indiffer|ence
hangs over them like a cloud, and
irk&s;ome pa&s;s the hours, wont to fly
with a &s;wift pace. Lo&s;ing all patience,
they fly from each other, and &s;eek with
indu&s;try new friend&s;hips.</P>

<P>The fox inclining to play the wag

were without reach of the &s;tork, fur|ther

&s;he liked her entertainment, hoped that
every di&s;h was &s;ea&s;oned to her mind,

like every di&s;h extremely; and at part|ing
gave the fox &s;o hearty an invitation
to dine with her, that he could not
in civility refu&s;e. But to his great
mortification, the dinner being compo|&s;ed
of minced meat, &s;erved up in long
narrow-necked gla&s;&s;es, he was tantali|&s;ed
with the &s;ight of what he had no ac|ce&s;s
to ta&s;te. The &s;tork, thru&s;ting in
a long bill, and helping her&s;elf plentiful|ly,
turned to Reynard, who was eager|ly
licking the out&s;ide of a jar where
&s;ome &s;auce had been &s;pilled,&mdash;I am glad,

an appetite: I hope you will make as
hearty a dinner at my table as I did
at yours. Reynard hung down his

<P>The Marquis of Louvois, jealous of
the Mar&s;hal de Turenne, did all in his

This jealou&s;y was the main &s;pring of
<PB N="245" REF="251">
the misfortunes of France in the cam|paign
1673. The King &s;aw him&s;elf

again&s;t the Empire, Spain, and Hol|land.
The Mar&s;hal de Turenne could
not di&s;&s;emble his unea&s;ine&s;s, and there
appeared in his countenance an air of
thoughtfulne&s;s and melancholy. Ha|ving
returned to court, after putting his
army into winter-quarters, the King re|ceived
him with great demon&s;trations
of e&s;teem and affection. His Maje&s;ty,
in private, conver&s;ed frequently with
him of the means to re-e&s;tabli&s;h affairs
next campaign; and &s;poke to him one
day of the fatal con&s;equences of Lou|vois's
coun&s;els; which gave Turenne
a favourable opportunity to revenge
him&s;elf of the mini&s;ter, had he been &s;o
di&s;po&s;ed. The Mar&s;hal contented him|&s;elf
with an&s;wering, &startq;That the Mar|quis
de Louvois was very capable of
doing his Maje&s;ty &s;ervice in the cabi|net,
but that he had not experience
enough in war to take upon him the

and genero&s;ity extremely plea&s;ed the
young King, who a&s;&s;ured Turenne, that
in &s;pite of all his mini&s;ters, he &s;hould
always be his favourite. He then &s;poke
of the Marquis de St Abr&eacute;, acquaint|ing
Turenne that St Abr&eacute; had blamed
his conduct, and written to Louvois,
that if he had been con&s;ulted, he could
ha$e &s;aved Bonne, without hazarding
Al&s;ace. &startq;Why then did he not &s;peak
to me?&endq; &s;aid the Mar&s;hal, with
great moderation: &startq;I &s;hould have
heard him with plea&s;ure, and profit|ed
by his advice.&endq; He then excu&s;ed
St Abr&eacute;, commended him, gave an ex|act
account of his &s;ervices, intreated
the King not to deprive him of &s;o able

<P>Upon a like occa&s;ion, our King Wil|liam
acted a different part, with general
approbation. After the revolution, let|ters
were intercepted from the Earl of
Godolphin to the dethroned King. This
was a crime again&s;t the &s;tate, but not
a crime to be a&s;hamed of. The Earl,
at the &s;ame time, was a man of appro|ved
virtue. The&s;e circum&s;tances
prompted the following cour&s;e. The
King, in a private conference, produ|ced
the Earl's letters to him; commend|ed

letters, that the Earl might not be un|der
any con&s;traint. This act of gene|ro&s;ity
gained the Earl's heart, and his
faithful &s;ervices ever after. The cir|cum&s;tances
here made the Earl certain
of the King's &s;incerity: at the &s;ame

were the only evidence again&s;t him,
placed him in ab&s;olute &s;ecurity, and

Croe&s;us for his profu&s;ion, a calculation
was made to how much his trea&s;ure
<PB N="262" REF="268">
might have amounted had he been more
&s;paring of it. To ju&s;tify his liberality,
Cyrus &s;ent di&s;patches to every per&s;on he
had particularly obliged, reque&s;ting them
to &s;upply him with as much money as
they could, for a pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ion, and
to &s;end him a note of what every one
could advance. When all the&s;e notes
came to Cyrus, it appeared that the
&s;um-total far &s;urp&s;&s;ed the calculation
made by Croe&s;us. &startq;I am not,&endq; &s;aid

princes; but a better manager of them.
You &s;ee at how low a price I have ac|quired

<P>A certain rat dwelling near a granary,

at plea&s;ure. It gives no joy to live
alone. The generous creature a&s;&s;em|bled

companions of lying? But this life was
too good to la&s;t. The proprietor of the

it up hard and fa&s;t. Our rat being thus
reduced to his &s;hifts, Happily, &s;ays he, I

with no better &s;ucce&s;s. One &s;tranger

<P>Clodius, Tribune of the Roman

King of Cyprus, obtained a decree
of the people, depo&s;ing King Ptolomy,

Ptolomy informed of the decree, was

<P>When Dion had re&s;cued Syracu&s;e

any &s;tudy but that of war. I was

revenge, envy, ob&s;tinacy, plagues
that corrupt the human heart. The
true te&s;t of &s;uch victory, is not kind|ne&s;s
to friends and to good men, but
lenity to wicked men that are our

not to yield at length to good treat|ment.&endq;</P>
<P>Henry Duke of Saxony was by nature
fierce and haughty, eager in his pur&s;uits,
impatient of di&s;appointment or control.
This temper was fo&s;tered by bad educa|tion.
So &s;oon as he could reflect, he
reflected that he was a &s;overeign, and he
was ever &s;oothed in the notions that a
prince is above all law. At the &s;ame
time he was inclined to the principles
of ju&s;tice and honour, where his pa&s;&s;ions
<PB N="275" REF="281">
did not oppo&s;e; and he had a profound
awe for the &s;upreme being, which, by
his wicked life, deviated into &s;uper&s;ti|tion.
The outrages committed by this
prince were without end; every thing
was &s;acrificed to his lu&s;t, cruelty, and
ambition; and at his court, beauty,
riches, honours, became the greate&s;t
misfortunes. His horrid enormities
filled him with &s;u&s;picion: if a grandee
ab&s;ented, it was for lei&s;ure to form
plots; if he was &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and obe|dient,
it was di&s;&s;imulation merely. Thus
did the prince live wofully &s;olitary, in
the mid&s;t of fancied &s;ociety; at enmity
with every one, and lea&s;t of all at peace
with him&s;elf; &s;inning daily, repenting
daily; feeling the agonies of reproving
con&s;cience, which haunted him waking,
and left him not when a&s;leep.</P>
<P>In a melancholy fit, under the impre&s;|&s;ions
of a wicked action recently perpe|trated,
he dreamed that the tutelar angel
of the country &s;tood before him with
anger in his looks, mixed with &s;ome de|gree
of pity. Ill-fated wretch, &s;aid the
<PB N="276" REF="282">
apparition, li&s;ten to the awful command
I bear. The Almighty, unwilling to
cut thee off in the fulne&s;s of iniquity,
has &s;ent me to give thee warning. Up|on
this the angel reached a &s;croll of pa|per,
and vani&s;hed. The &s;croll contain|ed
the following words, <HI>After &s;ix.</HI>
Here the dream ended; for the impre&s;|&s;ion
it made broke his re&s;t. The prince
awaked in the greate&s;t con&s;ternation,
deeply &s;truck with the vi&s;ion. He was
convinced that the whole was from
God, to prepare him for death; which
he concluded was to happen in &s;ix
months, perhaps in &s;ix days; and that
this time was allotted him to make his
peace with his maker by an unfeigned re|pentance
for all his crimes. How idle
and unplea&s;ant &s;eemed now tho&s;e ob|jects
which he formerly pur&s;ued at the
expence of religion and humanity!
Where is now that lu&s;t of command,
which occa&s;ioned &s;o much blood&s;hed;
that cruel malice and envy again&s;t every
contending power; that &s;u&s;picious jea|lou&s;y,
the cau&s;e of much imaginary trea|&s;on;
<PB N="277" REF="283">
furies fo&s;tered in his bo&s;om, prey|ing
ince&s;&s;antly upon his vitals, and yet
darlings of his &s;oul? Happy expul&s;ion,
if not &s;ucceeded by the greate&s;t of all
furies, black de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Thus, in the utmo&s;t torments of
mind, &s;ix days, &s;ix weeks, and &s;ix months
pa&s;&s;ed away; but death did not follow.
And now he concluded, that &s;ix years
were to be the period of his mi&s;erable
life. By this time the violence of the
tempe&s;t was over. Hitherto he had
&s;eque&s;tered him&s;elf from mankind, and
had &s;pent in ab&s;tinence and private wor|&s;hip,
the &s;hort time he thought allotted
him. Now began he to form re&s;olu|tions
of a more thorough repentance;
now was he fixed to do good, as for|merly
he had done mi&s;chief, with all his
heart. The &s;uppo&s;ed &s;hortne&s;s of his
warning had hitherto not left it in his
power to repair the many injuries he
had committed, which was the weigh|tie&s;t
load upon his mind. Now was he
re&s;olved to make the mo&s;t ample repa|ration.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="284">
In this &s;tate, where hope prevailed,
and &s;ome beams of &s;un&s;hine appeared
breaking through the cloud, he addre&s;&s;|ed
him&s;elf to his maker, in the follow|ing
terms. &startq;O thou glorious and om|nipotent
being, parent and pre&s;erver
of all things! how lovely art thou in
peace and reconciliation! but oh!
how terrible to the workers of ini|quity!
While my hands are lifted
up, how doth my heart tremble! for
manifold have been my tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions.
Headlong driven by impetuous pa&s;|&s;ion,
I de&s;erted the path of virtue,
and wandered through every &s;ort of
iniquity. Trampling con&s;cience un|der
foot, I &s;urrendered my&s;elf to de|lu&s;ions,
which, under the colour of
good, abandoned me &s;till to mi&s;ery
and remor&s;e. Happy only if at any
moment an offended con&s;cience could
be laid a&s;leep. But what &s;ource of
happine&s;s in doing good, and in feel|ing
the calm &s;un&s;hine of virtue and
honour! O my con&s;cience! when
thou art a friend, what imports it
<PB N="279" REF="285">
who is an enemy? when thou looke&s;t
dreadful, where are they fled, all the
ble&s;&s;ings, all the amu&s;ements of life?
Thanks to a &s;uperabundant mercy,
that hath not abandoned me to repro|bation,
but hath indulged a longer
day for repentance. Good God! the
la&s;hes of agonizing remor&s;e let me ne|ver
more feel; be it now my only
concern in this life, to e&s;tabli&s;h with
my con&s;cience a &s;aithful corre&s;pond|ence.
My inordinate pa&s;&s;ions, tho&s;e
deluding inchanters, root thou out;
for the work is too mighty for my
weak endeavour. And oh! mould
thou my &s;oul into that moderation of
de&s;ire, and ju&s;t balance of affection,
without which no enjoyment is &s;olid,
no plea&s;ure unmixed with pain. Here|after
let it not be &s;ufficient to be
quiet and inoffen&s;ive; but &s;ince gra|ciou&s;ly
to my life thou ha&s;t added
many days, may all be &s;pent in doing
good; let that day be deemed lo&s;t,
which &s;ees me not employed in &s;ome
work beneficial to my &s;ubjects, or to
<PB N="280" REF="286">
mankind; that at la&s;t I may lay me
down in peace, comforted if I have
not proved in every re&s;pect an unpro|fitable
&s;ervant.&endq;</P>
<P>His fir&s;t endeavours were, to regain
the confidence of his nobles, and love of
his people. With unremitting applica|tion
he attended to their good; and
&s;oon felt that &s;atisfaction in con&s;idering
him&s;elf as their father, which he never
knew when he con&s;idered them as his
&s;laves. N$w began he to reli&s;h the
plea&s;ure$ $f &s;ocial intercour&s;e, of which
pride and jealou&s;y had made him hither|to
in&s;en&s;ibl&egrave;. He had thought friend|&s;hip
a chimera, devi&s;ed to impo&s;e upon
mankind. Convinced now of its reali|ty,
the cultivation of it was one of his
chief objects. Man he found to be a be|ing
hone&s;t and faithful, de&s;erving e&s;teem,
and capable of friend&s;hip; hitherto he
had judged of others by the corrupt e|motions
of his own heart. Well he re|membered
his many gloomy moments
of di&s;gu&s;t and remor&s;e, his &s;pleen and
bad humour, the never-failing attend|ants
<PB N="281" REF="287">
of vice and debauchery. Fearful
to expo&s;e his wicked purpo&s;es, and
dreading every &s;earching eye, he had e|&s;tranged
him&s;elf from the world; and
what could he expect, con&s;cious as he
was of a depraved heart, but aver&s;ion and
horror? Mi&s;erable is that &s;tate, cut off
from all comfort, in which an unhappy
mortal's chief concern is to fly from
man, becau&s;e every man is his enemy.
After ta&s;ting of this mi&s;ery, how did he
ble&s;s the happy change! Now always
calm and &s;erene, diffu&s;ive benevolence
gilded every thought of his heart, and
action of his life. It was now his de|light
to be &s;een, and to lay open his
whole &s;oul; for in it dwelt harmony
and peace.</P>
<P>Fame, now his friend, blazed his vir|tues
all around; and now in di&s;tant re|gions
was the good prince known, where
his vices had never reached. Among
his virtues, an ab&s;olute and pure di&s;in|tere&s;tedne&s;s
claimed every where the
chief place. In all di&s;putes, he was the
con&s;tant mediator betwixt &s;overeigns,
<PB N="282" REF="288">
and betwixt them and their &s;ubjects;
and he gained more authority over neigh|bouring
