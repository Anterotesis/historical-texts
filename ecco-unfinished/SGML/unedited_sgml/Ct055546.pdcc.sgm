<HEAD>PROLOGUE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>.</BYLINE>
<L>YOU, who in furious Factions take Delight,</L>
<L>Know, you are not to be regal'd to Night;</L>
<L>The&s;e Scenes do no one &s;parring Blow afford,</L>
<L>But Peace and Moderation is the Word:</L>
<L>No &s;ide, nor Man on either &s;ide, is hit,</L>
<L>We &s;ingle out no Courtier, Clown, or Cit,</L>
<L>And if you're angry, 'tis all wrong, you're bit.</L>
<L>Nor let the well-bred Man, of Parts and Ta&s;te,</L>
<L>Look &s;harp for Dainties at a Country Fea&s;t;</L>
<L>Expect no &s;prightly Turns, nor Language here,</L>
<L>But re&s;t contented with your homely Chear,</L>
<L>'Tis &s;uch as we cou'd get at <HI>Croydon</HI> Fair.</L>
<L>Our Men of Mirth have never been at Court,</L>
<L>Where <HI>Beaux,</HI> and <HI>Belles,</HI> and gentler Wits re&s;ort,</L>
<L>Biters indeed! and of the better &s;ort.</L>
<L>To bare bambouz'ling we may chance pretend,</L>
<L>Or by the Chri&s;ten Name to catch a Friend;</L>
<L>But to &s;ome happier Wit we leave to tell,</L>
<L>Of tho&s;e who in true Biting mo&s;t excel.</L>
<L>For that great Work old Bards &s;hall ri&s;e again,</L>
<L>And the <HI>Sicilian</HI> Maids renew the lofty Strain.</L>
<L>Let not a Rival Writer &s;tir up Spight</L>
<L>In you, who judge of Comedy, or Write;</L>
<L>For tho' fond Parents on their Off-&s;pring doat,</L>
<L>And ev'ry Ideot Author loves the Brat he got;</L>
<L>Yet ours gives freely up his <HI>Petit Piece,</HI></L>
<L>And &s;wears that you may u&s;e it as you plea&s;e:</L>
<L>Nay, &s;hou'd you take his Drolling in good part,</L>
<L>He owns this only as a youthful Start,</L>
<L>And &s;ets no Claim up to the Comick Art.</L>
<L>So when keen Patriots pur&s;ue the Chace,</L>
<L>The &s;hifting State&s;man yields, and &s;ues for Grace,</L>
<L>And to pre&s;erve his Carca&s;e quits his Place.</L>

<P>He has been there with his Daughter the&s;e Three Days, &mdash;you are in love with her, have a mind to marry her; &mdash; he's a fanta&s;tical ob&s;tinate old Fellow, and re&s;olves again&s;t parting either with her or his Mony, but to a Cox|comb of his own chu&s;ing; who (by the way) came down in the &s;ame Coach with me to day,&mdash;&s;o that unle&s;s we can find out &s;ome Stratagem to make an A&s;s of him, and a happy Man of you, poor <HI>Angelica</HI> mu&s;t die a Maid, or marry the Fool, as afore&s;aid.</P>

<P>Fear nothing, Sir; Rug's the Word, all's &s;afe. For the old Gentleman, leave him to me.
