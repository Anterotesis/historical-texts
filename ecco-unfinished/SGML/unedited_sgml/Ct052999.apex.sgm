<HEAD>A VIEW OF THE <HI>Scots</HI> Rebellion, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Eyes are at this time whol|ly turn'd upon <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Di&s;cour&s;e of the Town is &s;o en|gro&s;s'd by the daily Accounts of the de&s;perate Re&s;olution of the <HI>Highland Clans</HI> to take up Arms for the <HI>Pretender,</HI> that &s;carce any thing el&s;e is talk'd of.</P>
<P>As to Matters of Fact, and the Hi&s;tory of their Proceedings in this Unnatural Ca&s;e, I have nothing to do with it; our daily Papers will be careful enough to in|form us of every thing as it pa&s;&s;es: But my pre&s;ent Affair is to &s;et right the Noti|ons of our People on one Side, as well as on the other; particularly, as to the Ability the&s;e <HI>Highlanders have,</HI> or <HI>have not,</HI> to give
<PB N="4" REF="3">
us Di&s;turbance, and what we have to fear from them; and this I think, is an Infor|mation we very much want.</P>
<P>Nothing is more extravagantly remote, than the Accounts of this Matter are from Truth, and from one another; one Side magnifying, and the other Side undervalu|ing the <HI>Highlanders,</HI> and the Power they may be &s;uppo&s;ed to rai&s;e, to &s;uch a De|gree, as equally tends to deceive and de|lude us; and both the&s;e, at a Time when nothing can be more fatal to this Nation, than to be deceiv'd one way or other.</P>
<P>Surely if the <HI>Highlanders</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> are in Arms; if they have declared for the <HI>Pre|tender;</HI> if they are preparing to march Southward; if there are &s;ix or &s;even Noble|men and a great many Gentlemen engaged, and that they are extending their Quarters, taking Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Sea Coa&s;ts, fortify|ing Towns, marching to their general Ren|dezvous, and forming their Troops for a War, as <HI>all</HI> our printed Accounts relate it, there mu&s;t certainly be one of the&s;e two Things in it:</P>
<P N="1">(1.) Either that they have a greater Strength among them&s;elves than we ima|gine: Or,</P>
<P N="2">(2.) They mu&s;t have greater Expectations of Relief and Supply from Abroad than we
<PB N="5" REF="4">
imagine; they mu&s;t have &s;ome Powers enga|ged with them, which they believe are able to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, in a Manner which we do not yet learn; and then it &s;hould follow, that they are to be look'd upon as a very for|midable and terrible People.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, if, as &s;ome relate, our Army is already in a Condition to at|tack them; if they are to be &s;urrounded and fallen upon by the Lord <HI>Sutherland</HI> in the Counties of <HI>Sutherland</HI> and <HI>Caithne&s;s,</HI> and by Lord <HI>I&s;la</HI> from <HI>Argyle-&s;hire</HI> and the We&s;t|ern <HI>Highlands,</HI> who will attack them in the Flank; if the faithful <HI>Highlanders</HI> are &s;uperior to them, both in Number and Vigour, and able to fall upon them without the A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of the Regular Troops; if the &s;topping a few Ships with Arms and Ammunition at <HI>Havre de Grace</HI> or St. <HI>Maloes,</HI> will effectu|ally di&s;able them, and render their being a&s;&s;i&s;ted from Abroad impracticable; then we may be ea&s;y, look upon them as alrea|dy &s;ubdu'd, and trouble our&s;elves no more at the Matter, the Men being only a few enrag'd Mad-men, ripe for De&s;truction.</P>
<P>It cannot be doubted but that both Sides run on extravagantly in their Accounts of the&s;e Things, and make the mo&s;t of what they tell us, according to the Parts they take in the Quarrel; and they think they
<PB N="6" REF="5">
do the Intere&s;t which they e&s;pou&s;e great Service, by magnifying or detracting, as their Humour leads, and that it is of U&s;e to talk High, whether they talk True or no: But I cannot think the&s;e Men in the right on either Hand; I think our Ca&s;e is not &s;o bad that we &s;hould be afraid to hear the wor&s;t that can be &s;aid with Truth, or &s;o good that we &s;hould not think it required all the A&s;&s;i&s;tance which Truth can give it.</P>
<P>Let us not flatter our&s;elves then, or fright our&s;elves, but let us endeavour to come to a right View of the Ca&s;e, that we may from thence make a right Judgment: Any one may &s;ee the De&s;ign is laid very deep, the <HI>Jaco|bites</HI> have not been idle neither has the Suc|ce&s;s of their &s;ecret Management been &s;mall; and were there Succe&s;s in the Publick Part of their appearing, to an&s;wer their Dili|gence, we &s;hould have more cau&s;e to dread them, than I hope we &s;hall ever have here.</P>
<P>This appears in the great Numbers of Gentlemen who have been drawn into the De&s;ign, and which they &s;ay are &s;everally embark'd. It is not for me to undertake to name, as &s;ome do, the Numbers which in every Part of the Kingdom have been deluded to engage in this Rebellion. But were one twentieth Part true of what is boa&s;ted of, the Revolution was &s;carce a
<PB N="7" REF="6">
more general Revolt than this is threaten'd to be.</P>
<P>However, it is not Talk that will re|move King GEORGE from the Throne; he is not to be &s;ung out of the Nation with a <HI>Lille-burlero,</HI> as King <HI>James</HI> was; and there|fore to encourage our&s;elves in the ju&s;t De|fence of the King and Kingdom, let us enquire boldly into the Strength of the E|nemy, and not be afraid to make the mo&s;t of it.</P>
<P>The In&s;urrection is at pre&s;ent only in the <HI>Highlands</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> it is indeed threatned in other Places, but there only they are yet actually in Arms, nor will I &s;uppo&s;e here, that they will be able to make Head in any other Places; the Vigilance of the Government, and the Power that they have at hand to &s;uppre&s;s them being con&s;idered, we have great Rea&s;on to hope they will not; and as it is not for any faithful Sub|ject to &s;ay what Rebels may attempt, &s;o neither is it fit we &s;hould intimidate or prepo&s;&s;e&s;s the Minds of the People with Apprehen&s;ions of Danger, when they are rather to be encourag'd to prevent than to expect it.</P>
<P>Let us then &s;ee in what State and Con|dition this In&s;urrection may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be, which is already begun; if any fur|ther
<PB N="8" REF="7">
Evils happen, it may be time enough to &s;peak of them when we &s;ee them.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I find two Things are much the Enquiry of our People when they &s;peak of this Matter.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>What the&s;e</HI> Highlanders <HI>are?</HI> And,</P>
<P N="2"><HI>(2.)</HI> What their Numbers may be?</P>
<P>As to the Particulars of what Forces they have now together, how furni&s;hed with Arms, Money, Ammunition, &amp;c. tho&s;e Things relate to the pre&s;ent Con&s;piracy more in particular than to the general En|quiry; but I find our People at a great Lo&s;s to know the Circum&s;tance upon which the re&s;t is formed; they neither know who they are to Fight with, or what the man|ner of the War is like to be; and this Ig|norance leads into many Errors; particu|larly, that <HI>on one hand</HI> they are apt to &s;light and Contemn them, as a weak and de&s;pi|cable People, not of Con&s;equence enough to give us any Concern, not powerful e|nough to make any Di&s;turbance, or worth our while to rai&s;e Troops again&s;t, but ea&s;ily to be &s;uppre&s;s'd by the Zeal of the Loyal People in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and by the ordinary Militia of the County; and this I think an Error which may be dangerous <HI>one way;</HI> or <HI>on the other Hand,</HI> they are &s;o ter|rified and allarmed at the&s;e <HI>Highlanders,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="8">
as if they were all Giants of the Sons of <HI>Anak,</HI> the mo&s;t terrible Fellows in the World, &s;o dreadful for their per&s;o|nal Valour, that no Men were able to match them, and &s;o formidable for their Numbers, that all the Forces in the Na|tion were not &s;ufficient to attack them, and that therefore nothing could now be done, without calling Foreign Forces over to our A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The&s;e Mi&s;takes I de&s;ire to rectify, and am per&s;uaded I &s;hall by no Means offend the pre&s;ent Government, in &s;etting the People to rights in this Matter, &s;eeing the latter Mi&s;take is of the two the mo&s;t preju|dicial, and the right repre&s;enting the&s;e Peo|ple, will certainly tend to the publick Ad|vantage, in preventing a fatal Contempt of a dangerous Enemy, or a publick Encou|ragement to the De&s;ertion of our People, if they think the Enemy likely to &s;tand their Ground.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then to the Que&s;tion, <HI>What the&s;e</HI> Highlanders <HI>are?</HI> Take it in a few Words:</P>
<P>They are the Inhabitants of the <HI>Norwe&s;t</HI> Parts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> including the Midland Part al&s;o, from the Water of <HI>Tay</HI> to the Water of <HI>Ne&s;&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>But as there are other <HI>Highlanders</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> be&s;ides tho&s;e who I am now to
<PB N="10" REF="9">
&s;peak of, I de&s;ire the Reader to ob&s;erve, that by <HI>the&s;e Highlanders,</HI> I am to be un|der&s;tood, tho&s;e who are now in Rebellion, for there are the <HI>We&s;tern Highlands,</HI> as well as the <HI>North,</HI> and the&s;e are generally tho&s;e who are &s;ubject to the Family of the <HI>Camp|bells,</HI> of whom the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> is the Chief or Head, and to the Family of <HI>Dougla&s;s,</HI> of whom the late Duke of <HI>Queens|bury</HI> was a collateral Branch, and the pre|&s;ent Duke of <HI>Dougla&s;s,</HI> a Minor, is the Chief. The&s;e are not at all concern'd in this Rebellion, but are in many Parts of a quite differing Intere&s;t, and rather enclin'd to the <HI>Cameronian Presbyterians,</HI> than to the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party.</P>
<P>Adjoining to the&s;e, and indeed the be|ginning of the <HI>North Highlanders</HI> are the Family of <HI>Broad-albin;</HI> the Word de&s;cribes the People, <HI>Broad</HI> &s;ignifying in the <HI>High|land</HI> Tongue, <HI>greate&s;t</HI> or <HI>mo&s;t extended;</HI> and <HI>Albin</HI> a <HI>Mountain,</HI> from whence al&s;o the mo&s;t Mountainous Part of <HI>Scotland</HI> is called <HI>Al|bany,</HI> and <HI>Broad-albin</HI> &s;ignifies the highe&s;t Part of <HI>Albany,</HI> or of the Mountains.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Highlanders</HI> we are told are in the Con&s;piracy, and that their Head, who is the Earl of <HI>Broad-albin,</HI> and of the Family of is one of the Peers of <HI>Scotland</HI> now in Rebellion; his Forces, meerly as
<PB N="11" REF="10">
Chief of the Name, are not e&s;teemed to be above 1200 Men; but as &s;ome of his Neighbouring Clans are to be &s;uppos'd to receive Encouragement from his Example, and to join their Servants and Va&s;&s;als to his, they have reported that the <HI>Broad-albin</HI> Men are 4000, which tho' I mu&s;t que|&s;tion the Truth of, yet I leave it to Time to di&s;cover.</P>
<P>From <HI>Broad-albin,</HI> North by <HI>Loquahaber</HI> and the <HI>I&s;lles,</HI> (viz.) the <HI>We&s;tern Sea-Coa&s;t</HI> is all included in what we call the <HI>Highlands,</HI> for about 100 Miles, even almo&s;t to the <HI>Nor|we&s;t</HI> Point of the I&s;le of <HI>Britain,</HI> inter&s;ected neverthele&s;s in the inland Part by the Coun|ty of <HI>Ro&s;s</HI> and <HI>Sutherland,</HI> and at the Head extended <HI>North</HI> to <HI>Strathnaver</HI> and <HI>Caithne&s;s,</HI> of which Counties the Earl of <HI>Sutherland,</HI> who&s;e elde&s;t Son has the Stile of Lord <HI>Strathnaver,</HI> the Lord <HI>Ro&s;s,</HI> and the famous Laird of <HI>Grant,</HI> are the Chiefs; the &s;aid Laird of <HI>Grant</HI> being al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of &s;ome Part of the <HI>Highlands,</HI> and the&s;e are all in the Intere&s;t of his Maje&s;ty King GEORGE, and if &s;ufficiently &s;upplied with Arms and Ammunition, &amp;c. and encouraged by the Pre&s;ence of their &s;aid Chiefs, the&s;e might be of great U&s;e again&s;t the rebellious Part, and may a&s;&s;i&s;t to &s;urround them, and di|vide
<PB N="12" REF="11">
their Forces when the King's Troops advance towards them from the <HI>South.</HI></P>
<P>The Breadth of the <HI>Highlands</HI> is diffe|rent, according to the Scituation and Po&s;i|tion of the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland;</HI> for the Sea bearing in upon the Land by &s;everal deep Bays and Firths or Inlets of the I&s;land it&s;elf, in &s;ome Places, may be e&s;teemed not above 40 or 50 Miles over; yet from <HI>Loquaber</HI> and the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Sea, on the We&s;t|&s;ide to <HI>Athol,</HI> and the Shire of <HI>Angus</HI> in the Ea&s;t, may all be e&s;teemed the <HI>Highlands,</HI> and in &s;ome Places is above 80 Miles over; and by this Account the whole Country called the <HI>Highlands,</HI> We&s;t as well as North, and including the I&s;les, may be e&s;teemed the greate&s;t Half of <HI>Scotland,</HI> of which Half two Thirds may, I believe, be ac|counted to the Rebellious Part of the <HI>Highlands,</HI> if Accounts be true.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, if it be true, which &s;ome of our Accounts inform us, that the Rebels have extended them&s;elves Ea&s;t, over all the Shires of <HI>Angus Mairn, Aberdeen,</HI> the <HI>Gowr$e</HI> and to the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Cromarty,</HI> from <HI>Montro&s;s</HI> to <HI>Inverne&s;s,</HI> and that having the Pa&s;s of St. <HI>John&s;town</HI> over the <HI>Tay,</HI> they are Ma&s;ters of the Province of <HI>Fife:</HI> I &s;ay, &s;hould this be true, then we may allow them to po&s;&s;e&s;s one full half of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="12">
as to Extent of Land I mean, but not as to the Wealth, Plentifulne&s;s and Number of the Inhabitants; nor is there any Doubt, but that as &s;oon as the King's Forces come to Action, and to advance upon them, but they will be &s;oon obliged to quit the <HI>Low|lands</HI> of <HI>Fife, Angas,</HI> &amp;c. and be confin'd to a narrower Compa&s;s.</P>
<P>But to proceed from the Country to the People: The&s;e Mountains are inhabit|ed by certain People, who tho' called <HI>Scots</HI> are more properly <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> and who as they really have their Original, &s;o they claim their Affinity to the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> by retaining the Habit and Language of the Ancient <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> many of them for &s;everal Scores of Miles being able to &s;peak or under&s;tand no other Language.</P>
<P>The Manners of the&s;e People are rude and barbarous, and tho' &s;ubject to the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Government, yet the Common Peo|ple know no Laws or Government but the ab&s;olute Will of their Chief. They are divided into <HI>Clans</HI> or <HI>Families,</HI> of which the elde&s;t Branch always pre&s;erves the Au|thority, and is called their <HI>Chief,</HI> and by his Primogeniture demands &s;uch a Homage that all the colateral Lines or Branches of the Family are &s;ubject to him by a kind of Natural Law: Under the&s;e Chiefs are the
<PB N="14" REF="13">
&s;everal Gentlemen of the Name, who have again under them their Tenants and Va&s;|&s;als; the fir&s;t are their ab&s;olute Slaves, and being &s;carce &s;en&s;ible of any other Law, or of any other Government, the Laird or Landlord commands them and their Sub|&s;tances on all Occa&s;ions, either for Civil Service or Military; and when they will not &s;tir upon the King's Call, or the beat|ing Drums for Voluntiers, yet on the Call of the Laird, tho' but with a Whi&s;tle or a Sounding-Horn, they will come together arm'd in a Moment, ready for any Mi&s;|chief that the Laird &s;hall command them to do, whether to Kill, Burn, Rob, Ra|vi&s;h, or whatever el&s;e comes to hand.</P>
<P>It was earne&s;tly wi&s;h'd that the Liber|ty of the&s;e People might have been ob|tained by the late <HI>&V;nion;</HI> but that Treaty had &s;o many other Enemies, and had &s;uch Difficulties in its bringing to pa&s;s, that had not the <HI>Northern Nobility</HI> been a&s;&s;ured be|forehand that their Patriarchial Tyranny &s;hould be re&s;erv'd to them, they had ne|ver been brought to acquie&s;ce in the Pro|ceedings in <HI>Parliament;</HI> and had they op|po&s;ed it in the <HI>Parliament,</HI> tho' they had not taken Arms, yet it was evident the <HI>&V;nion</HI> had never been brought to Perfection; &s;o that the Government were then obli|ged
<PB N="7" REF="14">
to drop the De&s;ign of giving the&s;e People the Liberty which their Neighbours enjoy, and to make it a <HI>Part</HI> of the <HI>Treaty,</HI> that all the Rights, Privileges and Supe|riority of the Gentry and Nobility &s;hould remain and be pre&s;erved as they were be|fore, which if it had not been the pre&s;ent Rebellion could not have happened.</P>
<P>But to return to the <HI>Highlanders:</HI> As the Tenants are thus entire Slaves to their Land|lords; &s;o many of the&s;e Landlords are not Free-holders, but Copy-holders as they may be call'd, and in <HI>Scotland</HI> are term'd Va&s;|&s;als, which hold their Lands as our Copy|holders in former Days did in <HI>England,</HI> by Knight Services, and other Services and Te|nures, and the&s;e Free-Tenants or Feudato|ries are obliged by their Tenures to mount on Hor&s;eback, or otherwi&s;e attend with their Arms and Accoutrements when ever the Chief or Laird commands, as may e|vidently appear from the Earl of <HI>Marr</HI>'s intercepted Letter to his Man <HI>Jockey,</HI> pub|li&s;hed in the Gazette <HI>Sept.</HI> 24. 1715. where|in fir&s;t he commands his own immediate Tenants to attend him as their Duty, and threatens Fire and Sword if they refu&s;e, as that he has a ju&s;t Right to puni&s;h them for their Di&s;obedience; and as for the Gentle|men, that is, his <HI>Free-Tenants</HI> or Copy-hold|ers,
<PB N="8" REF="15">
he &s;ummons them with their be&s;t Accoutrements on Hor&s;eback, and no Ex|cu&s;e, no, not Loyalty to their King to be accepted of. Take the Words out of the afore&s;aid Letter as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LETTER>
<P>I have &s;ent you enclo&s;ed an Order for the Lord&s;hip of <HI>Kildrummy,</HI> which you are im|mediately to intimate to all my Va&s;&s;als; if they give ready Obedience it will make &s;ome amends, if not, they may depend upon it I will be the fir&s;t to &s;end an Order to Treat them as Ene|mies; particularly, let my own Tenants of <HI>Kil|drummy</HI> know, that if they come not forth with their be&s;t Arms, I will &s;end a Party im|mediately to Burn what they &s;hall mi&s;s taking from them; and you are to tell the Gentlemen, that I'll expect them in their be&s;t Accoutrements on Hor&s;eback, and no Excu&s;e to be accepted of.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Mar.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>There need no more than the Stile of this Letter to give any one a true Idea of the State of the common People in the <HI>Highlands</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and with what ab&s;o|lute Authority the Lairds and Chiefs can command their Servants and Va&s;&s;als, al|tho' it were again&s;t their own undoubted Sovereign.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16">
This Subjection naturally allows that tho&s;e Chiefs have it more in their Power to di&s;turb the Civil Peace of the King|dom, than it were to be wi&s;h'd any Sub|jects in &s;o well ordered a Government as this is ought to be tru&s;ted with; and the pre&s;ent Rebellion is an unan&s;werable Proof of it; for upon this Authority of the Chiefs and Lairds is founded the whole Expectati|on of the <HI>Pretender.</HI></P>
<P>It was from this Rea&s;on that the late Earl of <HI>Godolphin,</HI> when he acted as Prime Mini&s;ter, thought fit to &s;ecure the Loyal|ty of &s;ome of the mo&s;t powerful as well as mo&s;t turbulent of the&s;e Chiefs, rather by fair Means, Promi&s;es, little Perferments, and &s;ome Money, than to give the Ene|my room to tamper with them, and bring them over by the &s;ame Acts to Engage|ments prejudicial to the common Intere&s;t; and the Wi&s;dom of this Management was &s;o approv'd afterwards, that altho' practi|&s;ed by another Party, perhaps with dif|fering Views, yet has receiv'd no Cen&s;ure among the Mi&s;managements of the late Reign.</P>
<P>The Names of the&s;e Chiefs are not &s;o material, being many and barbarous, &s;uch as the <HI>Mackenzies, Mac-donalds, Mac-into&s;hes, Mac gregros, Mac-pher&s;ons, Mac-leans,</HI> the
<PB N="18" REF="17">
<HI>Frazers,</HI> the <HI>Gordons,</HI> the <HI>Murrays,</HI> the Lairds of <HI>Glengary, Glenderule, Glencoe,</HI> and many others.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, the chief of the Nobility who are intere&s;ted in the&s;e <HI>Highlands,</HI> and who them&s;elves or their Sons are, as we hear, concerned in the pre&s;ent In&s;ur|rection, are the Duke of <HI>Gordon,</HI> who&s;e elde&s;t Son, the Marquis of <HI>Huntley,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Athol,</HI> who&s;e elde&s;t Son, the Marquis of <HI>Tullibardin,</HI> are with the Re|bels; the Earl Mare&s;chal, the Earl of <HI>Kinoul,</HI> by his &s;econd Son Mr. <HI>Hay,</HI> the Earls of <HI>Kil&s;yth, Broad-albin, Kinmure, Errol, South-Esk, Mare&s;cal,</HI> &amp;c. the Lord <HI>Drummond,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Marr,</HI> who commands the re&s;t, and &s;everal others of le&s;&s;er Intere&s;t; and it is not to be doubted but all the Strength the&s;e Men can mu&s;ter in the Field, &s;hall be brought together upon this Occa&s;ion, be|&s;ides the Inli&s;ted Men which they may pick up in the re&s;t of the Country, whe|ther they extend them&s;elves, and who, if they have Money to pay them, may be formed into Regular Troops, of which however I do not hear they have many; but of that when I &s;peak of their Numbers.</P>
<P>It remains to give &s;ome De&s;cription of the <HI>Highlanders</HI> them&s;elves; it is true, and the Manner of their Living in &s;ome mea|&s;ure
<PB N="19" REF="18">
requires it, that the&s;e <HI>Highlanders</HI> are more inur'd to Arms than the Inha|bitants of any other Part of <HI>Scotland,</HI> their Way of Living being to get their Sub|&s;i&s;tance in the Mountains by their Gun, &s;hooting Wild-Fowl, Deer, &amp;c. and by this Means they are not only all furni&s;h|ed with Arms, but as they live &s;ometimes in Enmity with one another, and decide their per&s;onal Breaches very often by the Sword, in which &s;ometimes, from the &s;mall Differences between two mean Per|&s;ons, the whole Families are engaged, and they often come to pitch'd Battles, one <HI>Clan</HI> again&s;t another, &s;o it occa&s;ions them to be more acquainted with their Arms, and with the Di&s;cipline of War, than other Men are; and it may be &s;aid of them, that they are the be&s;t undi&s;ciplin'd Soldiers that can be in the World; and tho' the Way of our Fighting in the Field is of late much altered, and di&s;ciplin'd Troops are become much more terrible than ever before, yet it was found by Experience, at the Fight at <HI>Gilly-crankey,</HI> that the raw and undi&s;ciplin'd <HI>Highlanders</HI> did, by the Fury of a de&s;perate Charge, put the Regular Troops into Confu&s;ion, and beat them out of the Field: But of this I believe there is not much Danger now.</P>

The <HI>Highlander</HI> is always arm'd, the meane&s;t Man among them, even the <HI>Dub|&s;calper,</HI> a Name for tho&s;e who run at the Hor&s;e-Foot of the Laird, is not without a Gun, a broad Sword, a Durk and a Tar|get; and their Dexterity at u&s;ing the&s;e Weapons, their Manner of Fighting with them, their Nimblene&s;s of Foot, and their Courage, are Things which would re|quire more Room to de&s;cribe them, than can be &s;pared in this &s;mall Tract.</P>
<P>Their Habit is hard to de&s;cribe, and is altogether barbarous, yet adapted to the Advantage of their Bodies, and admirably &s;uited to their Way of Living.</P>
<P>They wear Pumps for Shoes, &s;o thin, as that they rather tread the Ground than the Shoe, and this is for their Convenience in Running; and by which, as has been ob&s;erved of them, they have this Advan|tage in Fight, that if they are beaten, there is no overtaking them, and if they con|quer, it is very hard to get away from them; but their Sen&s;e of this nimble Fa|culty has al&s;o &s;ome Inconveniencies, which is, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That if the Impetuo&s;ity of their fir&s;t Charge is firmly received, and they cannot make an Impre&s;&s;ion with their fir&s;t Shock, they think of tru&s;ting to their Feet &s;ooner than other Men, and when
<PB N="21" REF="20">
they begin to run, ver &s;eldom look behind them, or rally again till they recover the top of the Hills, where they are &s;ure not to be follow'd by the Hor&s;e; &s;o that our Men have nothing to do but to receive the fir&s;t Fury of their Charge and &s;tand firm, and they may be &s;ure the <HI>Highlanders</HI> &s;eldom make a &s;econd; on the other Hand, the <HI>Highlanders</HI> being &s;o &s;wift of Foot, may &s;erve the more to animate the Courage of our Men, &s;ince their Hopes mu&s;t be in their Valour only, and they mu&s;t re&s;olve to tru&s;t to their Hands and not to their Heels in this War.</P>
<P>The <HI>Highlander</HI> garters his Stockings be|low the Knees, and wears no Breeches in the colde&s;t Sea&s;on, but his Plaid which is belted about him, and his Trouze hanging from his Wa&s;t to the middle of the Thigh and &s;omething lower, &s;erves him in&s;tead of Breeches, and hangs loo&s;e to his Thigh, open below, but plaited and full like the <HI>Vallens</HI> of a Bed, and not unlike the Skirts of the old <HI>Roman</HI> Habit, which always hung loo&s;e upon the Thigh, as may be &s;een by our Statues of Princes, which are dre&s;s'd like the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, &s;uch as that of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. in Marble on the <HI>Royal-Exchange,</HI> of King <HI>James</HI> II. in the <HI>Privy-Garden</HI> in Bra&s;s, and &s;everal o|thers
<PB N="22" REF="21">
By this Dre&s;s his Knee is naked for about two Hands Length above and below, and the Ham&s;trings being thus free from the Garters, they &s;uppo&s;e them&s;elves more nimble and ea&s;y; nor is the Cold which their other Parts are hereby expo&s;ed to any Grievance to them, but they bear it as readily as we do in our Faces or Hands, or other Parts daily expo&s;ed, which makes them very hardy.</P>
<P>They have be&s;ides this their <HI>Plaid,</HI> a loo&s;e Garment in the nature of a Robe, which they carry as it were on their Arm; it is thrown over their Shoulder, and tho' to our Imagination it &s;eems to be very cumber&s;ome, yet as they never go without it, they are &s;o dexterous in the ca&s;ting it about them and handling it, that it is no Hindrance to them at all, either in their running or handling their Wea|pons; on the contrary, they make it very &s;erviceable in their Fighting, by covering one half of their Body with it, e&s;pecially their left Arm and Shoulders, in &s;uch a manner as no Sword can cut thro' it, but that which it is more particularly &s;erviceable to them for, is, that they lodge in it as in a Hou&s;e, or that they may be &s;aid to carry their Tents always about them; and when they come into the Field, they &s;hall
<PB N="23" REF="22">
lodge more warm, wrapt up in their <HI>Plaid,</HI> than they think the other Soldiers can do in their Tents.</P>
<P>And thus I have given their Habit, their Weapons and Manner of Fighting their full Advantage; I come next to the Men them&s;elves, in which, however dread|ful they have been repre&s;ented, I mu&s;t crave Leave to differ from common Fame, in &s;everal Things relating to them, upon which the greate&s;t Stre&s;s is laid at this Time.</P>
<P>The Men are &s;trong, large, made hardy and very rugged, rather de&s;perate than bold, and rather furious than couragious; they have one Temper, which whatever it is in them, is in other Men in&s;eparable from a Coward, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That they are mercile&s;s, barbarous and bloody, no gene|rous Pity, no true Gallantry of Mind appears among them; but ob&s;erve, that it is the meaner Sort I am &s;peaking of, for Gentle|men will be Gentlemen in all Nations of the World, but the&s;e wild <HI>Highland|men</HI> may well be &s;tiled <HI>wild Men,</HI> for they act the brutal Part to Perfection, being vo|ratious, cruel, in&s;olent and unmerciful in their Pro&s;perity, and ba&s;ely &s;ervile or &s;ul|len if they are &s;ubdued.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="23">
As they are wedded to their barbarous Cu&s;toms, &s;o are they to their Way of Fighting, and it is the harde&s;t thing ima|ginable to bring them, <HI>I mean in their own Country,</HI> to alter their Method, or to fall into the new Di&s;cipline, or indeed to be per&s;waded that it is better than their own; this Infirmity of their Temper is as &s;ure a Pledge of their being beaten, whenever they come into the Field, as can be de|&s;ir'd, it being as impo&s;&s;ible for them to break into a Line of our Men, (when they &s;tand with their Bayonets on their Fire|locks charged as Pikes) as it was in for|mer Times for the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> tumultary Crowds to break in upon the <HI>Macedonian</HI> Phalanx, which &s;tood as a Wall of Bra&s;s, and being formed like a Wedge, by ad|vancing made gradually and nece&s;&s;arily its Way thro' the Bodies of their Ene|mies.</P>
<P>It is the &s;ame Ca&s;e here, and I doubt not but our Officers will be thoroughly &s;ati&s;|fied in this Part, that our manner of Fight|ing, clo&s;e Embatteling, and pre&s;enting the Point of the Bayonet with the Mu&s;quet, is &s;o naturally adapted to beat the <HI>Highlanders,</HI> and their open loo&s;e Order &s;o naturally ex|po&s;es them to be beaten, that nothing can be de&s;ir'd more.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="24">
Be&s;ides we are to take Notice that the <HI>Highlanders,</HI> hurried by the Impetuo&s;ity of their Tempers, are far from being the mo&s;t ob&s;ervant of their Lines; and choo&s;e to Fight in their open Order, as it may be called, that they may have room to Swing about their heavy broad and unweildy Swords, which in our way of Fighting are of very little u&s;e, as &s;hall appear pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erving then the difference in the very Nature of a Sword, which all pretend to be called Swords-Men mu&s;t know, the <HI>Highlan|ders</HI> can do nothing again&s;t our new Way of Fighting: the Rea&s;on is plain, they Fight with the Edge we with the Point; the Edge is a Blow, but the Point is a Bullet, the one falls down and may be defended many ways, the other pu&s;hes on in a &s;traight Line, and can|not by much be &s;o ea&s;ily defended; the Edge Wounds, but the Point Kills; a Man re|ceives many Cuts and yet &s;tands to his Work, but the fir&s;t Thru&s;t he receives is into his Vitals, and he drops immediately: The Strength of their Motion al&s;o differs, the Blow is made by the Arm only, the Thru&s;t by the Weight and Strength of the whole Body; the Blow is by the Sword only, the Thru&s;t is by the Sword at the end of a Mu&s;quet, &s;trengthen'd by the Weight of the Piece; the Blow is by the &s;ingle Hand,
<PB N="26" REF="25">
the Thru&s;t by both Arms; the Blow is flow and mu&s;t be preceded by lifting up and falling down, the Thru&s;t is &s;wift and &s;peedy; the Blow cannot be redoubled or recovered without Time, the Thru&s;t is re|covered and redoubled in a Moment: In a Word, the Soldier can make three Thru&s;ts to one Blow. From all which I infer, that the antient Terror of the&s;e <HI>Highlanders</HI> is entire|ly vani&s;h'd; and that unle&s;s the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> who now leads this Rebellious and Barba|rian Army can alter their way of Fight|ing, which he will find very difficult to do, our new Way has &s;o much the advantage of them, that the King's Army will be a|ble to Fight them, tho' they were three for one, and I refer my Opinion to the Event. Wherefore to encourage our&s;elves al&s;o, on a yet &s;urer and &s;tronger Foundation, I con|clude this Part in the Word of the <HI>faithful Spies</HI> to the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> when the wicked Spies terrified the People with the Multitude and Strength of their Enemies; <HI>Fear ye not the People of the Land for they are but Bread for us, their Shield is departed from them, and the Lord is with us,</HI> FEAR THEM NOT.</P>
<P>I come next to &s;ay a Word or two of their Numbers, and this mu&s;t be &s;poken to, either as it relates to the number of the
<PB N="27" REF="26">
People who are actually in Rebellion; or the real Number of the <HI>Highlanders,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing what they are all able to bring into the Field, if they were fully to exert them&s;elves, and were all of a Party; which, as is noted a|above, it is Evident they are not.</P>
<P>As to what the Number of tho&s;e are who are now in actual Rebellion, we have ma|ny Rea&s;ons to believe they are nothing near &s;o many as has been related; but of that I &s;hall &s;peak by and by; but it &s;eems nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;ay &s;omething of the Number of the <HI>Highlanders</HI> in general, &s;uppo&s;ing them to be all of a &s;ide, for if after that is done it &s;hould appear that the Numbers now in Rebellion are not proportioned to the whole Body above one to one, or perhaps as a|bove one to two, we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee Rea&s;on to alter our Thoughts, and to lay a&s;ide our Fears of this In&s;urrection, and learn to beat them by the Hands of their Neighbours, who can fight their own way and are as able to match them as Heart can wi&s;h.</P>
<P>But as to their Number in general: This I find al&s;o &s;o variou&s;ly &s;poken of, that there is no making any rational Conjecture from the Reports of the People; for tho' we could rate the <HI>Highlands</HI> at a ju&s;t Pro|portion to the re&s;t of <HI>Scotland,</HI> yet as there
<PB N="28" REF="27">
is no manner of Compari&s;on between the populou&s;ne&s;s of the Parts; &s;o if the <HI>Highlands</HI> are one third part of the Country, yet I cannot allow that they contain a &s;ixth Part of the Inhabitants of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and of them not a fourth Part can be &s;uppo&s;ed to be brought into any War of what kind &s;o|ever.</P>
<P>I'll &s;uppo&s;e then with the highe&s;t, that the Part of <HI>Scotland</HI> which is called the <HI>Highlands,</HI> is able to furni&s;h 50000 Fight|ing Men; no Man who &s;peaks of <HI>Scotland</HI> with any Under&s;tanding can &s;uppo&s;e them to be more, neither can there really be any Rea&s;on to call them &s;o many; of tho&s;e it cannot be doubted but the Loyal Nobility amount to a half; and if we &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e his Grace the Duke of <HI>Athol</HI> to retain his People in the Bounds of their Duty, it mu&s;t be above half, the <HI>Athol</HI> Men being reckon'd at lea&s;t at 5000.</P>
<P>The Dukes of <HI>Argyle, Douglas</HI> and <HI>Mon|tro&s;e,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Sutherland,</HI> the Lord <HI>Ro&s;s,</HI> and the Laird of <HI>Grant,</HI> and the o|ther <HI>Highland</HI> Lairds who are Loyal, mu&s;t be able to make up a Moyety of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>This then is &s;uppo&s;ing the Rebellious <HI>Highlanders</HI> to be 25000; but then we mu&s;t likewi&s;e &s;uppo&s;e, that every Man and Mo|thers Child, as it is &s;aid, &s;hall come into
<PB N="29" REF="28">
the Field, which is no more likely than that the young <HI>French</HI> King &s;hould go into the Field.</P>
<P>So that upon the whole, if the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> by the Influence of his Money, his o|ther Arts, and by the Witchcraft of Re|bellion, &s;hould &s;pirit up 10 or 12000 <HI>High|land</HI> Men tumultuou&s;ly to herd together and take Arms, it is as much as can be rationably expected.</P>
<P>And &s;hall the&s;e terrifie a whole Nation? &s;hall our Stocks fall, and our Countenances look pale at &s;uch a &s;ight as this? For &s;hame, let <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men rouze up their Spirits and act more like them&s;elves: Nay, tho' the Rebels &s;hould have the Encouragements of &s;ome &s;eeming Succe&s;&s;es in the beginning, tho' they &s;hould extend their Quarters, take open and unguarded Towns, impri&s;on naked and defencele&s;s Magi&s;trates, or de|feat any &s;mall Parties of Men in their fir&s;t &s;etting out; what will this amount to, when the Strength of the whole Kingdom comes to attack them in a Body? when they come out of their lurking Holes and Mountains to fight in the open Field with a powerful experienc'd and di&s;ciplin'd Ar|my of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Souldiers? As the whole Power of <HI>Scotland</HI> could never defeat us in plain Field, &s;ure a Body of Mounta|neers,
<PB N="30" REF="29">
fet on Fire with a mi&s;taken Zeal, and the Spirit of Rapine and Rebellion, cannot do it.</P>
<P>I know it is alledged by &s;ome, that the poi&s;on is &s;pread at home, that there are great Numbers in <HI>England</HI> di&s;affected to the Government, and re&s;olv'd to take Arms, and that this is the Hope of the Rebels in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Ground of all their En|couragement. Now, tho' I &s;hall not grant a Word of this to be true, becau&s;e we have &s;uch good ground to believe the Back of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;piracy is broken, their Mea&s;ures di&s;concerted, and &s;o many of the Heads of it are Scattered or Impri&s;oned; yet as <HI>England</HI> has always been able to deal with her own Rebels, and to puni&s;h tho&s;e who have attempted her De&s;truction, &s;o I doubt not &s;he will again, if any &s;uch at|tempts &s;hall be made; and therefore laying no &s;tre&s;s upon that part of the Rebels Ex|pectation, I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to the par|ticular Head where I began, and treat of <HI>Scotland</HI> only; for let <HI>England</HI> &s;tand how it will, there will not, there mu&s;t not fail to be &s;ufficient Armies provided to Fight the <HI>Scots</HI> Rebels as often as they dare &s;how their Faces, nay, tho' every Battle &s;hould not be a Victory; for as long as there runs any Prote&s;tant Blood in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Veins, there
<PB N="31" REF="30">
mu&s;t not an Hours Re&s;pite be given to a Rebellion of this Nature; nor is there any rea&s;on to fear the <HI>Highland</HI> Rebellion &s;hall ever bring us to that Extremity.</P>
<P>It remains then to enquire, what is the mo&s;t proper Cour&s;e to be taken for the immediate Reduction of this abominable Rebellion? that if their Confederates in <HI>Eng|land</HI> have any Views that way, they may be dealt with in proportion to their Merit.</P>
<P>I am far from undertaking to direct tho&s;e who have the management of Affairs; but &s;omething may be offered in which this War differs from others, and which perhaps every one has not equal Experience of.</P>
<P>It is mo&s;t certain, that the Country in which the&s;e Men are, and where they have rais'd their Rebellion, is Poor and Mountainous, Barren and Unho&s;pitable; nor is it by any means able to maintain an Army: If right Mea&s;ures therefore are ta|ken with the&s;e Men, they will be van|qui&s;h'd without Battle, and beaten with|out Fighting: It is true, that the Country does maintain the People when di&s;per&s;ed in Families and in Villages, thin and remote from one another; but it mu&s;t be allow'd, that there is a manife&s;t difference between the Supply of a thin &s;cattered People and the furni&s;hing a Body of People collected
<PB N="32" REF="31">
into an Army, who&s;e Provi&s;ions mu&s;t be ama&s;s'd together, laid up in Magazines, and carried from Place to Place where Ne|ce&s;&s;ity obliges them to March.</P>
<P>The main Step therefore would be to &s;urround them &s;o with Troops on all &s;ides that they &s;hould not be able to march out: That is, in &s;hort, to keep them at home, where they are, and &s;traighten their Quar|ters gradually till they are reduced to their real <HI>Highlands;</HI> and it is ea&s;ie to prove, that in a little time they mu&s;t &s;eparate, and by Con&s;equence Fight at Di&s;advantage, or Starve; let them choo&s;e which they plea&s;e of the Three.</P>
<P>This Notion would indeed be very ab&s;urd and ridiculous, were it not ea&s;ie to prove how practicable it is; and in Order to this, the Scituation of the Coun|try where they now are, is to be con&s;ider|ed.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, It is well known that as <HI>Britain</HI> in general is an I&s;land, and on all &s;ides &s;ur|rounded with the Sea, &s;o the <HI>North</HI> Part of <HI>Scotland</HI> is a <HI>Penin&s;ula,</HI> and is &s;urrounded with Sea on every &s;ide except to the <HI>South;</HI> this <HI>Southern</HI> Part again is reduc'd to a ve|ry &s;hort Front by the two Great <HI>Firths,</HI> or Inlets of the Sea; the one call'd, <HI>The Firth of Forth,</HI> and the other, <HI>The Firth</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="32">
<HI>of Clyde;</HI> the fir&s;t from the main Ocean runs in as far as <HI>Sterling,</HI> with a Breadth of &s;everal Miles, &s;ometimes more, &s;ometimes le&s;s, to <HI>Alloway,</HI> the Seat of my Lord <HI>Mar,</HI> within four Miles of <HI>Sterling-Bridge;</HI> and the other from the Iri&s;h Sea, bears in to or near <HI>Dunbarton-Ca&s;tle,</HI> and up to <HI>Gla&s;cow,</HI> carrying likewi&s;e a great Breadth of Wa|ter.</P>
<P>From the&s;e two Rivers is not above 20 Miles in breadth, and here only an Army mu&s;t be po&s;ted to keep the&s;e Wild People in. This is that famous Neck of Land where <HI>Adrian</HI> or <HI>Severus,</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> Empe|ror, built that famous Wall of Earth to defend the flat Country from the Incur&s;i|ons of the <HI>Picts,</HI> the Remains of which are to be &s;een to this Day.</P>
<P>The Wi&s;dom of the <HI>Romans</HI> &s;eems to be our Guide at this time, their Bu&s;ine&s;s was to keep the barbarous <HI>Picts</HI> within their own Bounds, to wit, the black Hills and rugged Mountains of the <HI>North;</HI> and this they thought was a &s;ufficient Conque&s;t of them, and even &s;o would it be &s;till; for if they cannot pa&s;s this <HI>Narrow I&s;tmus,</HI> it is evident they can neither make War upon us, or &s;ub&s;i&s;t them&s;elves; &s;o that Encamp|ing or even Cantoning a good &s;trong Body of an Army at this Place, by which they
<PB N="34" REF="33">
may be kept in and re&s;trained, &s;o as that they could not break thro' without a Bat|tle, would &s;oon put an end to this Rebel|lion without much Blood; for it is plain, the <HI>Highlanders</HI> can neither keep in a Body nor get Shipping to Tran&s;port them&s;elves over the two <HI>Firths.</HI></P>
<P>The Sea&s;on of the Year will not permit them to keep the Field with an Army du|ring the Winter, they mu&s;t either come to Action or di&s;per&s;e: As for coming to Action and Fighting a pitch'd Battle with an Army acting defen&s;ively only, it will be very probable, that if they will do it they may be obliged to do it with great di&s;advantage; &s;uch as attacking them in|trench'd, pa&s;&s;ing a River in their Faces, or &s;ome &s;uch difficulty; which they, who are not the be&s;t di&s;ciplin'd Troops in the World, as it is; would be le&s;s fitted to un|dertake than other Armies might be. And thus they may come to our Hands at a cheaper Rate than ordinary; and if they do not venture thus to fight at a di&s;ad|vantage, they mu&s;t keep within the Li|mits afore&s;aid, till by the &s;everity of the Sea&s;on, the deep Snows and long Nights of almo&s;t 18 Hours, and intollerable Cold, they are obliged to retire. And thus the War may co&s;t le&s;s Blood than others may imagine.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="34">
Nor let any one mi&s;take me, and think I am Talking &s;o un&s;ouldier-like as to &s;up|po&s;e that in this Po&s;ture the Rebels &s;hall be left free to range at Plea&s;ure over the whole <HI>North</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to Rob the King of &s;o great a Part of his Dominions. No, no, no|thing le&s;s is in the View by this Scheme of War; for as the Sea is at his Maje&s;ty's Command, and they lie open on every &s;ide to be Invaded, there can never want Opportunity to Land upon them in all the proper Places on the Sea-Coa&s;ts, and to break in upon them by Land, &s;o, as &s;oon to &s;treighten their Quarters and gradually drive them to tho&s;e Hills where they well know they cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t at all.</P>
<P>To make this yet more evident, the Sci|tuation of <HI>Scotland</HI> will afford a Circum|&s;tance which perhaps few expect; for the <HI>Northern</HI> Countries of <HI>Scotland</HI> form two other <HI>Penin&s;ula</HI>'s or <HI>Demy I&s;lands</HI> beyond this of the <HI>Forth</HI> and the <HI>Clyde.</HI> For Ex|ample, by the River <HI>Tay,</HI> the greate&s;t Ri|ver and the longe&s;t in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Sea enters within the Country, on the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> &s;ide from the <HI>Readhead</HI> Point, with a broad <HI>Firth</HI> as high as St. <HI>John&s;town</HI> or <HI>Perth,</HI> be|ing near 40 Miles: Oppo&s;ite to this, on the <HI>We&s;t</HI> the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Sea breaks in from <HI>Loquabar,</HI> and the great <HI>Loch Lomon</HI> &s;preads it&s;elf &s;o
<PB N="36" REF="35">
far, that together with the unpa&s;&s;able Moun|tains of <HI>Broad-albin,</HI> there is not above 30 Miles&punc; of pa&s;&s;able Ground to break through in that Part; and thus the Northern Part is again cut off, and all the <HI>Highlands</HI> South by <HI>Tay</HI> will be in his Maje&s;ty's Hands when|ever it may be found convenient to ad|vance over the River <HI>Forth,</HI> and drive them with a Power &s;ufficient beyond the River <HI>Tay.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is this all, but there is yet a third <HI>Penin&s;ula</HI> farther <HI>North,</HI> much narrower than the&s;e; it is form'd by the Water of <HI>Ne&s;s,</HI> the Pa&s;s whereof is at <HI>Inverne&s;s,</HI> on the <HI>Ea&s;t-&s;ide,</HI> and the Water of <HI>Loch</HI> or <HI>Lochy,</HI> which bears far into the Land on the <HI>We&s;t-&s;ide,</HI> and which by a Line drawn from the <HI>Roch</HI> Head to the <HI>Ne&s;&s;e</HI> about 8 Miles, cuts off the mo&s;t <HI>Northern</HI> Countries of <HI>Caithne&s;s, Sutherland, Ro&s;s, Strathnaver,</HI> &amp;c. which Countries being fertile and populous and the Inhabitants firm in his Maje&s;ty's In|tere&s;t, that <HI>I&s;tmus</HI> being well guarded by a fortified Pa&s;s, and a Body of Troops to be &s;ent by Sea, the Rebels will be then more &s;treightned, and mu&s;t in the End fall without fighting, or fight infinitely to their Di&s;advantage, and con&s;equently to their Ruin.</P>
<P>If any Man thinks this Advice Un&s;ol|dierly, and a putting too great a Weight

on the pre&s;ent Rebellion, let him read the <HI>Hi&s;tory of the Low-Country Wars,</HI> and the Conduct of that great Soldier, the old Duke <HI>d' Alva,</HI> who&s;e Maxim was, when the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> brought &s;everal times great Armies of Hired <HI>Germans</HI> to &s;upport his In&s;urrections; the Duke cho&s;e always to act on the Defen&s;ive, protract the War, a|void Fighting, and by harra&s;&s;ing them and &s;treighting their Quarters, to make them moulder away without Action, or fight to Di&s;advantage, by which Means he al|ways overthrew them. The like Cour&s;e did the Kings of <HI>France,</HI> or their Generals rather, take with the <HI>Hugenots,</HI> by which they were often forced to disband, either for want of Provi&s;ions or for want of Pay&punc; and &s;ending their Forces into di&s;tant Parts, were brought to Terms of Submi&s;&s;ion of|tentimes without Blood.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things bring me to another Article, which will of it&s;elf reduce the Rebellion in <HI>Scotland</HI> without Fighting, if they are but kept from breaking out into the <HI>Lowlands,</HI> and this is want of Money; it is true that we are told they have Money, and that the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> promi&s;es to pay them as Regular Troops; But how long will this Money la&s;t, and by what Means can they get Supplies, and from whom?</P>

It is well known that even the <HI>Pre|tender</HI> him&s;elf, who&s;e Fund is in the Zeal of a few Bigots, and who begs or borrows that little he gets, will be &s;oon exhau&s;ted, if the <HI>War,</HI> as they call it, be not brought to a Pu&s;h; if it is &s;pun out in Length, his Tether will be run out and his Supply fail&punc; And how can the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> and his <HI>Highlanders,</HI> tho' ever &s;o de&s;perate and re&s;olute, carry on &s;uch an Undertaking without Money?</P>
<P>This makes it evident, that if this War is brought to a Length, the Rebels mu&s;t fall an ea&s;y Prey into his Maje&s;ty's Hands, and that without Blood; Victory can ne|ver be &s;aid to be bought dear, when it co&s;ts no Blood. The Lo&s;s of Time can be of no fatal Con&s;equences on our &s;ide, and no|thing but the Lo&s;s of Time can &s;o effectual|ly ruin them; they have a de&s;perate Game to play, we have a &s;ure Game; they have no Hope but in making a bold Pu&s;h for Victory before the King's Forces are col|lected, and &s;o to inlarge them&s;elves into the <HI>Lo$lands,</HI> where they may get Money, Provi&s;ions and Arms, and be join'd by more People; if they are conquered in this Attempt, if they are lock'd in between the Sea and their own Mountains, and left to fight with Hunger and Cold, and cannot
<PB N="39" REF="38">
break out; they will &s;tarve or &s;urrender in a few Months.</P>
<P>I know our Enemies will &s;ay that they may be relieved by Sea, having much of the Coa&s;t open to them, both on the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-&s;ide</HI> of the I&s;land; but while our Men of War are kept in proper Stations, crui&s;ing upon tho&s;e Shores, and as we know they have no Men of War to act for them, but mu&s;t depend upon &s;uch Ships as can by Stealth and Chance e&s;cape to them, it will be found very difficult to &s;upply them by Sea.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, What profit will it be to their foreign Friends, and what Encouragement to relieve and &s;upply them barely with Food to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, when they are confined to a narrow &s;tint of Land, and dare not &s;et them&s;elves at Liberty by the Sword? This will be ju&s;t making them like the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Family to be fed or kept at Board-wages, and we know, <HI>good Man!</HI> he is ill able to maintain the Hou&s;hold he has, he need not entertain any more, much le&s;s a Fa|mily as big as a little Nation; if they are not able to fight for him, they are of no U&s;e to him, and he will &s;oon be weary of &s;ending them Supplies.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="39">
To &s;um up this Matter in few Words: It is plain, the Strength of this Rebellion is ju&s;t now in its Prime, to fight them immediately, gives them a fair Ca&s;t, as we may call it, for their Cau&s;e, and who knows what may happen? But to &s;ur|round them with Forces, and &s;pin out the Time upon them, they will be undone of cour&s;e, and be vanqui&s;h'd without a Blow.</P>
