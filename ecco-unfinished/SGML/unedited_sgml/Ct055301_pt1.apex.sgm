<P>I Pre&s;ume to approach you without the cere|mony of a formal introduction: if my intru|&s;ion is impertinent, you will puni&s;h it by neglect.</P>
<P>IN prefixing your name to my performance, I di&s;claim all &s;ordid motives. I addre&s;s my&s;elf, not to the mini&s;ter, but to the patriot. What I offer is not a &s;acrifice to intere&s;t; but a tribute due to &s;uperior merit. Power and office are adventitious and tran&s;itory. They are often ve&s;ted in the wicked and the worthle&s;s. They perpetually fluc|tuate between accident and caprice. To-day, you &s;tand con&s;picuous at the helm of &s;tate: to|morrow, you may repo&s;e your&s;elf in the &s;hade of private virtue. My veneration is attached to per|manent qualities: qualities that exi&s;t independent

of favour or of faction: qualities which you can neither forfeit nor re&s;ign. I re&s;pect tho&s;e &s;hining talents by which you have di&s;tingui&s;hed your&s;elf above all your cotemporaries. I revere that inte|grity which you have maintained in the mid&s;t of corruption. I appeal to you as a con&s;ummate judge of literary merit; as an undaunted a&s;&s;ertor of Briti&s;h liberty; as a &s;teady legi&s;lator intimately acquainted with the con&s;titution of your country, which you have &s;o nobly defended from incroach|ment and violation.</P>
<P>SHOULD the Hi&s;tory I now pre&s;ent, have the good fortune to acquire your approbation, I &s;hall bear, without repining, the in&s;ults I may &s;u&s;tain from the virulence of malignant cen&s;ure. Should it be found altogether unworthy of your notice and regard, it will naturally &s;ink into oblivion. What|ever may be its fate with you, or with the public, I gladly &s;eize this opportunity to declare that I am, with the mo&s;t perfect e&s;teem and admiration,</P>

<HEAD>PLAN OF THE COMPLETE HISTORY OF ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<P>SO many Hi&s;tories of England have already appeared, that the editor of this performance finds it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to make the Public acquainted with the motives which have induced him to u&s;her into the world another work on the &s;ame &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The author does not pretend to have di&s;covered any authentic records which have e&s;caped the notice of other hi&s;torians; or to have thrown &s;uch lights upon particular facts, as mu&s;t alter the received opinions of mankind, touching the material circum&s;tances of the narration. His aim is to retrench the &s;uperfluities of his predece&s;&s;ors, and to pre&s;ent the Public with a &s;uccinct, candid, and complete Hi&s;tory of our own coun|try, which will be more ea&s;y in the purcha&s;e, more agreeable in the peru&s;al, and le&s;s burthen&s;ome to the memory, than any work of the &s;ame nature, produced in the&s;e kingdoms.</P>
<P>By the enormous bulk and prolixity of every other Engli&s;h hi&s;tory that &s;tands in any degree of reputation, many readers have been deterred from learning what every per&s;on ought to know, and even totally di&s;|couraged from engaging in the mo&s;t entertaining and u&s;eful of all ra|tional inquiries.</P>
<P><PB REF="60">
The author has avoided all u&s;ele&s;s di&s;qui&s;itions, which &s;erve only to &s;well the &s;ize of the volume, interrupt the thread of the narrative, and perplex the reader. His purpo&s;e was to compile an hi&s;tory, not to compo&s;e a di&s;&s;ertation.</P>
<P>He has waved all remarks of his own, except &s;uch as &s;eemed ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that he might not encumber the page, and di&s;gu&s;t the reader, by anticipating his reflection, and fore&s;talling his judgment.</P>
<P>He has forborn to record foreign incidents in which England has no immediate concern; as the de&s;ign is not to publi&s;h the annals of Europe, but the tran&s;actions of one people. Neither has he literally tran&s;cribed every treaty of alliance, and each &s;ingle decree of parliament, &s;o as to form a mon&s;trous medley of the highe&s;t enterprizes of power, and the lowlie&s;t precautions of civil oeconomy. Such a work would be a dry, tedious, fatiguing collection of public acts and &s;tatutes, rather than a well connected detail of hi&s;torical events.</P>
<P>He has been upon his guard again&s;t that affectation of &s;ingularity, which is &s;o apt to betray an author into a labyrinth of vague conjectures, through which the truth often vani&s;hes from his re&s;earches.</P>
<P>He values him&s;elf upon being entirely free from all national jealou&s;y and prejudice; and altogether uninfluenced by that illiberal partiality which has di&s;graced the works of many Engli&s;h hi&s;torians. He is &s;oured by no controver&s;y in religion: he is inflamed by no faction in politics. Truth is the object of his inquiry; and candid information the &s;cope of his labour.</P>
<P>He pr$tends to communicate a &s;ummary idea of the antient inhabi|tants of this i&s;land, as de&s;cribed by Greek and Latin authors, the only fources from which we can draw any certain intelligence concerning the original po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of Britain.</P>
<P><PB REF="70">
After a di$tinct detail of Cae&s;ar's de$cent, the progre&s;s of the $oma$ arms in England under &s;ucce&s;&s;ive emperors, the formation of the pro|vince, their improvements in the civil policy of the country, the gra|dual declen&s;ion of their power, and their final retreat to the continent; he proceeds to de&s;cribe the fir&s;t dawnings of the chri&s;tian fa$th in $word$ the arrival, &s;ettlement, character, and genius of the Saxon adventur$$s; the $word$ and progre&s;s of our con&s;titution in church and &s;tate; and the changes it underwent in con&s;equence of the Norman conque&s;t.</P>
<P>He mentions every material tran&s;action, whether of war or of peace, whether public or private, which might conduce to the illu&s;tration of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>He collects hi$ materials from the mo&s;t $uthentic hi&s;$orians, to who&s;e works he$refers in the margin. He delineates the characters of princes, from the uniform tenour of their public conduct$ co$pared with &s;trik|ing pa&s;&s;ages in private life, which often exhibit the real, naked picture, uncloaked with re&s;erve, undi&s;gui&s;ed by formality or di&s;&s;imulation.</P>
<P>He records every remarkable improvement in arts and &s;ciences, which the world has owed to the natives of this kingdom.</P>
<P>He exhibits a &s;eparate view of eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, dige&s;ted into di&s;tinct periods, from the fir&s;t preaching of Chri&s;tianity in Britain, to the late&s;t regulations of church-government.</P>
<P>He has endeavoured to write in a clear, &s;uccinct, nervous &s;tile; to ar|range his materials with accuracy and preci&s;ion; to expatiate on the mo&s;t intere&s;ting circum&s;tances; and to entertain the imagination, while he informs the under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>In order to a&s;&s;i&s;t the memory, and &s;upply proper pau&s;es for the at|tention, he has planned the work into a certain number of books or parts, each comprehending the tran&s;actions of one important period;
<PB REF="80">
and the&s;e are &s;ubdivided into chapters, furni&s;hed with titular contents, th$t di&s;tingui&s;h every individual &s;ection or paragraph.</P>
<P>The chronology is a&s;certained from year to year, on the margin.</P>
<P>All ob$cure allu&s;ions are explained in notes at the bottom of the page; together with the genealogical deduction of every prince's po&s;terity and marriages, reputed portents, detached events, and private an$cdotes: which, though tending to elucidate the &s;tory, would, if in&s;erted in the context, di&s;unite the chain of incidents, and &s;poil the uniformity of the execution.</P>
<P>On the whole, this work is formed upon a plan which was the re&s;ult of the mo&s;t mature deliberation; and has one advantage over all other hi&s;tories of England; namely, that of being brought home to our own times and ob&s;ervation, from the earlie&s;t age of our hi&s;torical credit to the la&s;t treaty of Aix la Chapelle.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; I.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t and mo&s;t important effort of human genius appears to have been the art of tran&s;mitting and perpetuating ideas; and this &s;hines in nothing more con&s;picuous than in the labours of hi&s;torians, which not only pre&s;ent us with a review of all tho&s;e mighty events which influ|enced the fate of nations, but al&s;o communicate to our inquiry the whole pro|gre&s;s of improvement, the whole circle of knowlege and experience. In this delightful &s;tudy we become acquainted with the characters and even the per&s;ons of tho&s;e heroes who triumphed over barbarity, of tho&s;e legi&s;lators who &s;trength|ened the bands of &s;ociety, and of tho&s;e philo&s;ophers who in&s;tructed, poli&s;hed and reformed mankind. The faculties of the mind are opened and enlarged in the contemplation of &s;uch an expanded field: the humane pa&s;&s;ions are intere&s;ted in the fortune of the remote&s;t nations, becau&s;e humanity is every where the &s;ame; and, how&s;oever divided by mountains, rivers and &s;eas, &s;evered by policy, di&s;|per&s;ed by accident, or di&s;tingui&s;hed by a difference of laws, language, climate, or complexion, we are all the children of one parent; all the brethren of one

family. The under&s;tanding unfolds and ripens in proportion to the exerci&s;e it un|dergoes; the memory retains, the reflection profits by the example, and the heart glows with a laudable e$$ulation to rival the practice of recorde$ virtue.</P>
<P>Of all the di&s;$$i$ts in this w$$e extended field, no province exhibits more illu&s;|trious &s;cenes and characters; $word$ $$&s;tory a richer fund of entertainment and in|&s;truction, than that of Britain, which we now purpo&s;e to di&s;play: and &s;urely no &s;ubject can merit our attention &s;o much, no theme &s;o warmly engage our hearts, as that which treats of our own country; as that which expatiates upon inci|dents relating to tho&s;e very ance&s;tors from whom we our&s;elves are immediately derived. Yet$ how intere&s;ting &s;oever the &s;ubject may be, the ta&s;k is not to be p$rformed wit$o$$ difficulty and even di&s;gu&s;t, ari&s;ing from the ob&s;eurity that vei$s $he $$igin of this as well as of all other n$tions, and the perplexed though elabo|rate di&s;cu&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e who have fondly endeavoured, by wild conjectures, to trace it backwards into the &s;hades of ignorance and allegory of fable.</P>
<P>Among other uncertainties, nothing &s;eems to have puzzled tho&s;e &s;earch|ers into antiquity more than the name of the i&s;land, which has been variou&s;ly pronounced by various nations, according to the particular genius and termina|tion of every re&s;pective, language.</P>

To t$$&s;e ob&s;ervations we may add, that Holland, Zealand, and the lower parts of F$anders plainly appear to have been once covered with the &s;ea, which would naturally leave them dry on finding &s;uch a pa&s;&s;age; and that the &s;etting of two<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid.

<P>Such a &s;eparation (if it really happened) was an advantage to Great Britain, ina&s;much as it formed a noble barrier to defend this i&s;land from the in&s;uits, intrigues, and inva&s;ions of its neighbours, of whom it was in other re&s;pects al|together independent: for, it produces all the nece&s;&s;aries and comforts of life: the &s;oil is fruitful, the air, though moi&s;t, not unhealthy: it abounds with cattle, $or$$ $imber, minerals and metals; the windings and indentations of the coa&s;t afford numberle&s;s bays, creeks and harbours for the &s;ecurity of &s;hipping, and the &s;urrounding &s;ea teems with myriads of fi&s;h for food and exportation. Here the &s;ummer is not &s;corching, nor the winter &s;evere; the heat is tempered with cooling breezes, the fro&s;t is tamed by the warmth of the &s;ea; the ground is cloathed with a perpetual verdure; and the country diver&s;ified with hill and dale, &s;o as to exhibit a variety of enchanting pro&s;pects to the view.</P>

<P>The Briti&s;h i&s;les, including tho&s;e of Scilly, called by the Greeks Ca&s;&s;iterides, were di&s;covered by the Phoenicians about four hundred and fifty years before the birth of Chri&s;t; and a trade to the&s;e parts was opened by the Carthaginians, who, about the year of Rome three hundred and &s;even, &s;ent Hanno and Hamil|car with two fleets to &s;ea, north and &s;outh from the &s;treights of Gibraltar, with a view to di&s;cover the we&s;tern coa&s;ts of Africa and Europe, with the i&s;lands that lay in the Atlantic ocean. Hamilcar, who was charged with the northern voyage, having coa&s;ted along Spain and Gaul, di&s;covered the i&s;land of Great Britain; and &s;ailing up the channel, penetrated into the German ocean as far as the Bal|tic. Long before this period, however, Britain was peopled from the conti|nent; and almo&s;t all authors, who have treated on this &s;ubject, agree that the fir&s;t inhabitants ow$d their origin to the Celtae or Gauls that &s;ettled on the oppo|&s;ite &s;hore.

Thracia$$, Scythians, and almo&s;t all the nations of Europe, were at th$$ period, addicted to the &s;ame abominable act of inhumanity. They probably imagined, that the more valuable the life, the more acceptable was the &s;acrifice: and the Brito$$ and Cauls adopted this rite the more eagerly, as they deemed it &s;ub&s;ervient to the purpo&s;es of divining future events: for, having<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diodor.

A cenemony &s;o inhuman and dete&s;table, that the Romans, contrary to their u&s;ual elemency and political regard to conquered nations, &s;oon after they &s;ubdued Britain, e$ti$pated the whole race of tho&s;e religious butchers, with almo&s;t every memori$l of their &s;uper&s;tition.</P>

<P>Exclu&s;ive of this diabolical &s;uper&s;tition, the Druids are &s;aid to have made<NOTE PLACE="marg">C$$&s;ar de $ello Gallico.</NOTE> a very good u&s;e of their power and influence: they were celebrated for the inno|cence of their manners, and their equitable and impartial admini&s;tration of ju&s;|tice: they in&s;pected the conduct of magi&s;trates, took care that the laws &s;hould be put in execution, vacated all illegal acts of the &s;overeign, whom they &s;crupled not to depo&s;e, when he was unduly elected or abu&s;ed his authority. Nor was their importance altogether owing to their religious character, but depended in a great mea&s;ure on the dignity of their birth, and the intere&s;t of their family: for the function of a Druid neither derogated from their nobility, nor excluded them from the highe&s;t offices in the &s;tate: they continued to enjoy both with|out the lea&s;t re&s;triction; and &s;ome of them were even known to exerci&s;e the $overeign power.

Tho&s;e chiefs might well maintain the &s;ame character and pr$rogative among the people of their re&s;pective clans, which were no other than multiplied fami|lies, that for their common &s;afety and advantage, united together to form particular &s;tates, like the Gauls, under the government of an ordinary &s;enate, and an extraordinary general council which met annually and a&s;&s;embled on &s;pe|cial occa&s;ions.</P>

<P>The in&s;titution of the Druids, notwith&s;tanding the dangerous power that was ve&s;ted in their hands, will appear to have been extremely well calculated for pre|venting rapine, violence, and outrage, among a pa&s;&s;ionate, vindictive &s;avage people, like the Gauls and Britains, living in &s;eparate dyna&s;ties, divided by par|ticular intere&s;ts, and &s;ubject to perpetual feuds and animo&s;ities.

He attempts to prove, from Cluver's Germanis Antiqua, and other au|thors, that the Briti&s;h i&s;les, as well as all the $eltic nations in the north of Europe, were known to the Greeks by the name of Hyperbo|rei; that the Hebrides, or rather the i&s;le of Harrie$ in particular, was the place de&s;cribed by Diodorus Siculus, who &s;ays, he copied He|cataeus, and other authors, in his de&s;cription of the Hyperbor$an i&s;land, lying in the ocean be|yond Gaul, in the north we&s;t of Europe; that many ages before the Phoenicians traded to the coa&s;t of Britain, this i&s;land was known to the Greeks of Delos, with whom it's inhabitants carried on a regular corre&s;pondence; tran&s;mit|ing every year the fir&s;t fruits of the earth, as an offe ing to the Delian deities, which they them|&s;elves al&s;o adored withgreat conformity of wor&s;hip; and that this intercour&s;e having been intermitted for &s;ome time, an Hyperborean Druid, of the name of Abares, was $ent to Greece to renew this league of friend&s;hip and alliance, about &s;ix hundred years before the chri&s;tian area&mdash;True it is, Herodotus mentions a nation of the Hyperborei unknown to the Scythians, but greatly re&s;pected at Delos, whi|ther they u&s;ed to &s;end, from time to time, &s;acred pre&s;ents of their fir&s;t fruits wrapped in bundles of wheat &s;traw, like tho&s;e u&s;ed by the T$racians in their rites and &s;acrifices to Diana. The&s;e were &s;ent at fir&s;t by deputies con&s;i&s;ting of two virgins and five men, who were received with the greate&s;t honours by the Delians; and when the virgins died, their funerals were celebrated with the utmo&s;t &s;olemnity, and even hymns compo&s;ed in their prai&s;e. The Hyperboreans, loth to run the ri&s;que of lo&s;ing the mo&s;t valu|able per&s;ons of their nation, in &s;uch a tedious and hazardous peregrination, fell afterwards up|on another expedient for &s;ending their offerings to the temples of Apollo and Diana: they de|livered them to their neighbours on the continent, reque&s;ting that they might be forwarded from one people to another, until they arrived at the Adriatic, where they were put into the hands of the Dodonians, who conveyed them &s;afely to Delos. As the Greeks increa&s;ed in reputation for learning, the Druids of the Hebrides di&s;&s;atisfied with this di&s;ta$$ manner of communica|tion, dep$ted one of their number to go and di&s;cover what improvements had been made in knowlege, and renew the antient league with the Delians. This was the famous Abaris, celebrated by Jamblicus; and Porphyry, who &s;ays he was a p$ie&s;t of Apollo; that he travelled ever all Greece, and pa&s;&s;ing to Crocona in Italy, $$&s;ited Pythagoras, with whom he contracted an int macy of friend&s;hip.&mdash;Strabo gives us to un|der&s;tand that Aba$$s was admired by the Greeks for his politene&s;s and integrity.
Hime|ri$s de&s;cribes him, as covered with a plaid fa&s;|tened with a gilded belt that encircled his loins, from whence his trou&s;ers de&s;cended to the &s;oles of his feet: he carried a bow in his hand, and a quiver hung from his &s;houlders. He was ea|&s;y in his addre&s;s, agreeable in his conver&s;ation; a man of great di&s;cernment, eager in the pur|&s;uit of knowlege, unblemi&s;hed in his morals; and he &s;poke the Greek language with great fluency and elocution.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all the learning which has been di&s;played, and the ingenious conjectures that have been formed from the &s;i uation of the Hebrides, the di&s;po&s;ition of the natives, the nature of their wor&s;hip, and the remains of their temples, to prove that they were the Hyperbo|reans of which this philo&s;opher was a native; the fact &s;till remains dubious and uncertain. The great antiquity of the event has removed it without the &s;phere of di&s;tinct ob&s;ervation. Diodorus Siculus, who de&s;cribes this Hyperbo|rean i&s;land, certainly believed it was different from Britain or Ireland, with which he was well acquainted; otherwi&s;e he would have di&s;tin|gui&s;hed it by its proper name: &s;uch a corre|&s;pondence between the Delians and Hyperbo|rean i&s;landers could not fail to open a trade be|tween Greece and Britain, which did not take place till &s;ome centuries after this period, tho$ many of the &s;tates of Greece were then ac|quainted with navigation. Herodotus, in relat|ing the story of the Hyperborean deputies, does not mention one word of their coming from an i&s;land; and looks upon the circum&s;tance of Abaris as a meer &s;able. In a word, the name of Hyperboreans &s;eems to have been a vague appellation be&s;towed by the Greeks upon the northern nations which they did not know, and much more applicable to the Laplanders, than the inhabitants of the we&s;tern i&s;les of Scotland.</P></NOTE>.</P>

Strangers to luxury, and even to what are now thought the nece&s;&s;aries of life, their wealth con&s;i&s;ted in their herds of cattle, which they drove from place to place for the convenience of pa&s;ture, like the antient Nomades: as for the tin, lead, iron, corn, ivory bridles, collars, amber, gla&s;s ve&s;&s;els, ba&s;kets, and other toys, which were exported from Britain, they were manufactured by the Belgae, and other nations who &s;ettled in the maritime parts of the i&s;land: the inland inhabitants dealt in nothing but cattle, hides, and tallow, which they bartered for &s;uch things as they deemed indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary; they lived in wretched huts or cabbins made of boughs, and plai&s;tered with mud; and even in the&s;e they found means to manife&s;t their ho&s;pitality to &s;trangers, whom they e&s;teemed as &s;acred and inviolable. Their diet was &s;imple and par&s;imonious; their food con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of milk and veni&s;on; their ordinary drink was water; yet, upon extraordinary occa&s;ions, they indulged them&s;elves with a kind of fermented liquor made of barley, honey, or apples, and when intoxi|cated, never failed to quarrel, like the antient Thracians. <NOTE PLACE="marg">D$od. l. 5.</NOTE></P>
<P>They were taller, though le&s;s robu&s;t, than the Gauls; yet their con&s;titutions were inured to hard&s;hip and fatigue; and their longevity was the immediate ef|fect<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plutarch de Plaut.

The dre&s;s of their nobles con&s;i&s;ted of a belted plaid of variegated colours, with trou&s;ers, that an&s;wered the purpo&s;es of &s;tockings as well as breeches; and the&s;e were common to all the Gauls upon the continent: &s;ome of tho&s;e who could not afford to purcha&s;e this habit, covered them&s;elves with &s;kins, and the poorer &s;ort went almo&s;t quite naked. Perhaps it was in con&s;e|quence of this want of covering, that they had recour&s;e to the practice of painting their bodies, with a &s;ub&s;tance that &s;hut up the pores, and defended the nerves of the &s;kin from the inclemencies of the weather: thus fortified, Dio Nicaeus tells us, they could endure the &s;evere&s;t cold, and even remain whole days immer&s;ed in mud. They were poorly provided with warlike weapons, either for annoyance or defence: the better &s;ort u&s;ed the broad &s;word and dagger, together with javelins and arrows; but the common people had no other offen&s;ive arms than &s;harpened &s;ticks for javelins, and long &s;taves edged with flint, or headed with copper, in lieu of halberts, which were likewi&s;e furni&s;hed with a kind of bell to &s;care their enemies in battle. They had neither coats of mail nor helmets, but defended them&s;elves with light round targets of wood, or twigs covered with leather and &s;tudded with nails of bra&s;s. The only finery which they affected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tacit. Vit. Agricol.</NOTE> was in their chariots of war, which were curiou&s;ly carved and painted, and &s;o contrived as to be &s;topped and turned on the declivity of hills, with a&s;toni&s;hing dexterity: they were generally drawn by two hor&s;es; and each contained the driver and a &s;ingle warrior, who darted his javelins at the enemy, and even drove among their thicke&s;t ranks, terrifying, trampling, and cutting them in pieces with long scythes fixed to the axle-tree of the wheels. They frequently<NOTE PLACE="marg">Frontinus de Stratagem.</NOTE> leaped from their chariots, and fought on foot, until being fatigued or overpow|ered, they re&s;umed their &s;eats; and they were &s;o expert in the management of tho&s;e machines, that they could &s;top or turn them at full &s;peed, &s;it, &s;tand, run upon the beam, and leap out and in, as the occa&s;ion required. They often re|treated on purpo&s;e to draw the enemy into confu&s;ion, and then returned to the attack with redoubled fury; but, they always engaged in &s;eparate bodies, that they might have room to act, and &s;u&s;tain tho&s;e that wanted &s;uccour. The Bri|$ons, as well as the Gauls, were remarkably bold and enterpri&s;ing; they charged with &s;urpri&s;ing impetuo&s;ity, after having endeavoured to intimidate the foe with

the hoar&s;e and di&s;mal &s;ound of their barbarous trumpets, repeated &s;houts, and the cla&s;hing of their arms; and they advanced to battle, dancing like the Cu|retes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diod l. 1.</NOTE> and &s;inging the valiant deeds of their ance&s;tors. They were warlike, even in their favourite diver&s;ion, which was hunting; and, for this rea&s;on, their princes and chiefs commonly fixed their habitation in the mid&s;t of woods and fore&s;ts, frequented by the game; and, indeed, this was the &s;ituation of all their towns, which were compo&s;ed of mi&s;erable huts, built in &s;pots cleared of wood, which &s;erved them as a fortification; for they were almo&s;t always at war, with one ano|ther, or with the colonies of the Belgae, and other nations which they could ne|ver forgive for their intru&s;ion. This enmity may have become more rancorous after they were invaded by Divitiacus, king of the Sue&s;&s;ones, who being in great credit with the whole body of the Belgae, re&s;olved to make their friend|&s;hip &s;ub&s;ervient to his ambition, and conquer the i&s;land of Britain by their a&s;&s;i&s;|tance. For this purpo&s;e, he, about five and twenty years before Cae&s;ar's expedi|tion, a&s;&s;embled a great army of his own &s;ubjects, reinforced by the Bibroci, the Atrebates, and other Belgic nations adjoining to his own territories, and pa&s;&s;ing over into Britain defeated the natives in &s;everal encounters. He &s;ub|dued the countries at pre&s;ent known by the names of Berks, Oxford, Hants, Wilts, Somer&s;et, and Suffex; in which he planted colonies of his Belgian auxi|liaries, after having expelled the Regni and other tribes of the old inhabitants. The Belgae, who were already &s;ettled in Britain, probably &s;ubmitted and joined him on this occa&s;ion; a circum&s;tance that could not fail to render them &s;till more odious to the native i&s;landers. The&s;e unintermitting ho&s;tilities kept up their martial di&s;po&s;ition and contempt of danger, which was not confined to the male &s;ex, but &s;hone &s;o remarkable in the Briti&s;h women, that they often ru&s;hed into the battle, and braved the weapons of the enemy. They always at|tended their hu&s;bands in the field, encouraging them to deeds of glory; no<NOTE PLACE="marg">$$utarch de vi$tu$e $word$</NOTE> war was undertaken without their advice; they judged of the contraventions of public treaties; they &s;at in council, and were con&s;ulted on the mo&s;t important occa&s;ions.</P>

<P>JULIUS CAESAR having conquered Gaul, and &s;everely cha&s;ti&s;ed the Germans, who had cro&s;&s;ed the Rhine, in order to favour a general re|volt and in&s;urrection of their neighbours, re&s;olved to make a de&s;cent upon the i&s;land of Britain, which was almo&s;t altogether unknown to the Romans. His pretence was to puni&s;h the i&s;landers, for having &s;ent &s;uccours to the Gauls while he waged war again&s;t that nation, as well as for granting an a&s;ylum to the Belgae, after having excited them to a rebellion, in con&s;equence of which they were routed, and compelled to abandon their own country. The&s;e were &s;ufficient mo|tives in a Roman general, con&s;idering the political maxims of that people, who always looked upon the auxiliaries of their enemies as principals in the quarrel, and attacked them accordingly, without any declaration of war, concerning which they were in other ca&s;es extremely formal and punctilious. Over and above the&s;e inducements, &s;ome authors &s;uppo&s;e Cae&s;ar to have been influenced by the hopes of finding a great quantity of fine Briti&s;h pearls, which were then much in re|que&s;t. But avarice was no part of his character; and we may with more plau|&s;ibility<NOTE PLACE="marg">Suetoniu$.</NOTE> &s;uppo&s;e, he was, on this occa&s;ion, actuated by that ambition and thir&s;t of glory which &s;eems to have been the characteri&s;tic of his di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Whatever the true dictates of his heart may have been, he determined to em|ploy the latter part of the &s;ummer, that remained after his German expedition, in an ho&s;tile vi&s;it to Britain; and though he &s;hould find the &s;ea&s;on too far ad|vanced to make any progre&s;s in the operations of war, he fore&s;aw advantage in making him&s;elf acquainted with the coa&s;t, creeks, and harbours, as well as with the genius of the inhabitants, which were very little known, even to the traders who went thither on account of commerce. With this view he previ|ou&s;ly
<PB N="14" REF="230">
con&s;ulted the merchants, who could give him no &s;atisfaction touching the &s;ize of the i&s;land, the number of nations by whom it was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, their laws and cu&s;toms, their practice in war, or their harbours, that were capable of con|taining a great number of large ve&s;&s;els. Thus left to his own conjectures, he detached C. Volu&s;enus in a frigate to examine the coa&s;t, and return as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible with his report; while he him&s;elf advanced, with all his forces, into the territory of the Morini, which lay neare&s;t to the Briti&s;h &s;hore; and here he or|dered that all his &s;hips &s;hould be a&s;&s;embled, without delay.</P>
<P>Mean while, his de&s;ign being communicated by &s;ome merchants to the inhabi|tants of the maritime parts of Britain, chiefly tho&s;e who had removed thither from the oppo&s;ite continent, they &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to make their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and promi&s;ed to deliver ho&s;tages for their good behaviour. Cae&s;ar received them with great com|placency, and having exhorted them to continue &s;tedfa&s;t in the &s;ame &s;entiments, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them to their own country, together with a Briti&s;h prince, called Co|mius, whom he had appointed king over the Atrebates, and of who&s;e attach|ment and &s;agacity he was well a&s;&s;ured. Knowing this Comius was held in great veneration and e&s;teem in Britain, he directed him to vi&s;it the different &s;tates, and u&s;e his influence in per&s;uading them to &s;ollicit the protection of the Romans, which he would grant on his arrival in the i&s;land. As for Volu&s;enus, he returned in five days from the coa&s;t of Britain, which he had examined from the &s;ea, with|out daring to land on &s;uch an ho&s;tile &s;hore; and imparted his ob&s;ervations to Cae|&s;ar, who formed his plan accordingly.</P>

<P>Having collected about eighty tran&s;ports, which he judged &s;ufficient for the embarkation of two legions, and allotted for his cavalry eighteen of a larger burthen, that were wind-bound on another part of the coa&s;t, at the di&s;tance of eight miles, he di&s;tributed his officers on board of a few gallies, ordered the re&s;t of his army to be cantoned among the Menapii and part of the Morini, un|der the conduct of Q.

Finding it impracticable to gain the &s;hore in that place, on account of the &s;welling &s;urf and the impending mountains, from whence his &s;oldiers mu&s;t have been griev|ou&s;ly annoyed by the Britons, he re&s;olved to choo&s;e a more favourable &s;trand, for making his de&s;cent. Mean while as he lay at anchor, to wait for that part of the fleet which had not yet arrived, he called a council of his officers, to whom he imparted the remarks of Volu&s;enus, together with his di&s;po&s;ition for landing, and the preci&s;e order bywhich every individual was to act in his own province; then taking the fir&s;t opportunity of the wind and tide, he made the &s;ignal for weigh|ing anchor, and &s;ailed about eight miles along &s;hore, till he found an open road, and a level country.</P>
<P>The Britons, &s;u&s;pecting his de&s;ign, detached their cavalry and chariots of war to the &s;ame &s;pot, and following with the re&s;t of their forces, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ground, in &s;uch a manner, as to hinder the Romans from approaching the &s;hore; for, as their &s;hips drew too much water to float near the beach, the
<PB N="15" REF="240">
&s;oldiers were obliged to leap overboard; when being encumbered with the weight of their armour, intangled in the &s;ea, and expo&s;ed to the ri&s;que of plunging into unknown holes, and caverns under water; they did not fight with their u&s;ual alacrity, but &s;eemed affrighted at the fury and re&s;olution of the i&s;landers, who not only galled them with their javelins from the &s;hore, but even ru&s;hed upon them in the &s;ea, fighting hand to hand with amazing vigour and intrepidity.</P>
<P>Cae&s;ar, perceiving the di&s;advantage under which his &s;oldiers laboured, directed his gallies to be rowed nearer to the &s;hore, &s;o as to flank the Britons, again&s;t whom the &s;lings, arrows, and projectile machines were plyed with great execution and &s;ucce&s;s; for, the i&s;landers, as much confounded and intimidated at the &s;trange figure of the gallies, the motion of the oars, and the contrivance of the bali&s;tae, as at the damage they &s;u&s;tained from the &s;tones and mi&s;&s;ile weapons, &s;uddenly pau&s;ed, and then retired to a &s;mall di&s;tance. Notwith&s;tanding this check the Ro|mans &s;eemed aver&s;e to tru&s;t them&s;elves in &s;uch a depth of water, when the &s;tand|ard-bearer of the tenth legion ob&s;erving their backwardne&s;s, leaped into the &s;ea, calling aloud, "Follow me, my fellow-&s;oldiers, unle&s;s you want to betray the ea|gle into the hands of the enemy." Thus adjured, they &s;prung overboard with|out further he&s;itation, and made towards the &s;hore, where being met by the ene|my, a very ob&s;tinate battle en&s;ued, which had like to have proved fatal to the Romans, who finding it impo&s;&s;ible to form in the water, could not avail them|&s;elves of their di&s;cipline and military &s;kill, while tho&s;e who gained the &s;hore were &s;urrounded and cut in pieces, before they could a&s;&s;emble in any number, or be drawn up in order of battle.</P>

<P>In this emergency, Cae&s;ar commanded the boats belonging to the fleet to be crammed with &s;oldiers, in order to row about and &s;u&s;tain tho&s;e who wanted &s;uccour: and this expedient determined the fortune of the day, by enabling his men to gain firm footing on the beach, where, forming immediately in a con&s;i|derable body, they proceeded to charge with their u&s;ual con&s;idence; and now profiting by that heavy armour which had encumbered them before, they &s;oon compelled the naked Britons to quit the field with precipitation; though Cae&s;ar could not improve his victory for want of his hor&s;e, which were not yet arrived <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><P>This de&s;cent was made from the Downes, and the battle fought at the place which is now called Deal; as Cae&s;ar's own account of the expedition, plainly evinces; for, the land he fir&s;t made could be no other than Dover, which is nearer than any other part of Britain to the Gallican &s;hore; and he de&s;cribes the cliffs with great accuracy. From thence he &s;ailed with the tide &s;etting to the northward, and turning a point of land, which was the South foreland, came to an anchor in the Downes, after a pro|gre&s;s of eight miles. The di&s;tance from Dover, the headland he turned, the flatne&s;s of the beach and the openne&s;s of the country, leave no room to &s;u&s;pect that the place of his land|ing could be any other than Deal. This &s;up|po&s;ition is confirmed by the tradition of the Bri|tons as well as of the Saxons, who mentioned the circum&s;tance in a table hung up in Dover ca&s;tle; this opinion is likewi&s;e embraced by Nennius, who &s;ays, Cae&s;ar ad Dole bellum pug|navit; and Camden ob&s;erved in this place, the remains of the ramparts which Cae&s;ar rai&s;ed to defend the &s;hipping from the a&s;&s;aults of the wea|ther and the enemy.</P>

This &s;torm, which happened at the full moon, was attended with &s;uch an high tide, that in the night all the gallies which the Romans had hauled a&s;hore for &s;afety, were filled with water; while of tho&s;e which rode at anchor, &s;ome ran foul of one another and were de&s;troyed, and the re&s;t were rendered u&s;ele&s;s by the lo&s;s of their anchors, cables, ma&s;ts and rigging: a mi&s;erable &s;pectacle to the army on &s;hore, who could give them no a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and having no materials for re|fiting the damaged ve&s;&s;els, &s;aw them&s;elves deprived of the means of returning to Gaul, and de&s;titute of provi&s;ion on which they could &s;ub&s;i&s;t through the winter in Britain.</P>

that went forth, and communicated this ob&s;ervation to Cae&s;ar, who immediately &s;u&s;pecting &s;ome new attempt of the i&s;landers, marched out at the head of the cohorts that were upon duty, after having ordered other bands to take their &s;tation; and the re&s;t of the army to follow him with the utmo&s;t expedition: when he had advanced a good way from the camp, he found the &s;eventh legion hard pre&s;&s;ed by the enemy, who concluding they would naturally come to this place, as here only the corn was not yet reaped, had formed an ambu&s;cade in the woods, from which they &s;uddenly fell upon the Romans, when they were di&s;per&s;ed and unarmed, &s;o as to cut off a few, and di&s;order the re&s;t, who could hardly re&s;i&s;t the attacks of &s;uch a furious multitude as &s;urrounded them; for, the Britons not only &s;howered their darts and javelins at a di&s;tance, but likewi&s;e drove among them with their chariots of war, by which they were greatly di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed.

That &s;ame day they &s;ent deputies to &s;upplicate the mercy of the Roman commander, who granted them peace, on condition that they &s;hould &s;end to the continent double the num|ber of the ho&s;tages he at fir&s;t demanded; and now that the autumnal aequinox approached, and his &s;hips were very unfit for a winter voyage, he forthwith re|embarked his army and returned to Gaul.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;ucce&s;s of the fir&s;t attempt the Romans made on the liberty of Britain, which was defended by the natives with all that &s;pirit and enthu&s;ia&s;m which freedom and independency in&s;pire; and thus ended that celebrated expedition of Cae&s;ar, which, tho' unattended with any other &s;olid advantage than that of making him acquainted with the coa&s;t of the i&s;land, and the temper of the inha|bitants, was extolled at Rome above all the victories he had obtained over the Germans and the Gauls, and his &s;ucce&s;s in Britain acknowledged by a &s;upplica|tion of twenty days. Although this was an extravagant and ridiculous decree of the &s;enate, con&s;idering the little progre&s;s he had made in his fir&s;t de&s;cent, it is at lea&s;t a glorious te&s;timony of the opinion which the Romans, in the meridian of all their power and glory, entertained with regard to the valour of our an|ce&s;tors; neverthele&s;s, we cannot a&s;&s;ent to the overweening conjectures of tho&s;e who, from an illiberal partiality to their own country, pretend, that Cae&s;ar was actually defeated by the Britons; whereas it appears they were utterly unable to cope with him in the field, even when they had an immen&s;e &s;uperiority in point of number; that the &s;mall advantage they gained over the &s;eventh legion was the effect of perfidy and &s;urprize; and that his &s;udden return to the continent in &s;uch a &s;hattered condition, did not &s;o much denote his apprehen&s;ion of the

<P>But, his departure was delayed by a commotion among the Treviri, who were &s;aid to have engaged with the Germans, in &s;ome intrigues again&s;t the Roman government. Cae&s;ar marching into their territories, at the head of four legions and eight hundred hor&s;e, confirmed Cingetorix in the magi&s;tracy, received the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the &s;tate, and carried off two hundred ho&s;tages, in|cluding the &s;ons and kindred of Indutiomarus, who was a turbulent man, and at the head of a great faction. Nor were the&s;e the only pledges he demand|ed for the peaceable behaviour of the Gauls in his ab&s;ence: when he returned to Itium, he convened the cavalry of Gaul, and all the chiefs, except a very few in who&s;e attachment he could confide, re&s;olving they &s;hould accompany him in his expedition. Among the&s;e was Dumnorix the Aeduan, who either dreading the dangers of the &s;ea, or intending to rai&s;e a rebellion after Cae&s;ar's departure, earne&s;tly de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed from the voyage, and finding Cae&s;ar inflexible, withdrew in the night with the Aeduan cavalry; but being pur&s;ued and overtaken by Cae&s;ar's troops, he refu&s;ed to return or &s;ubmit; and fell fighting with great gallantry, and calling aloud, with his late&s;t breath, that he was "a free-born Gaul, native of a free nation; and that he would not be en&s;laved."</P>

He forthwith marched down to the &s;ea-&s;ide, where he learned the particulars of his lo&s;s, and found that forty &s;hips were utterly de&s;troyed: in order to repair the re&s;t, he called all the carpenters from the le|gions, and in a letter to Labienus, de&s;ired that all his workmen might be em|ployed in building a number of new ve&s;&s;els.

<P>This &s;tupendous work being fini&s;hed in ten days, with infinite labour, he appointed a proper guard or garri&s;on for it's defence, and put his troops again in motion again&s;t the Britons, whom he found in the &s;ame place they had before occupied, to an incredible number. By this time their common danger had induced them to forget, or at lea&s;t &s;uppre&s;s their former &s;euds and animo&s;i|ties, and unite their whole &s;trength for the mutual defence of their liberty and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. They had convened a general council of all their &s;tates and dy|na&s;ties, in order to deliberate on the emergency of their affairs, and fore&s;eeing nothing but confu&s;ion and anarchy would prevail in an army compo&s;ed of in|dependent chiefs that owned no &s;uperior, and knew no &s;ubordination, they una|nimou&s;ly conferred a dictatorial power upon Ca&s;&s;ivelaunus, who&s;e territories (comprehending Hertford&s;hire, Bedford&s;hire, and Bucks) were divided from the maritime &s;tates by the river Thames. This prince had been formerly en|gaged in continual wars with his neighbours, and acquired &s;uch reputation in military &s;kill, that they now deemed him worthy of being inve&s;ted with the &s;ove|reign command; though this was a very dangerous experiment, which nothing

<P>The fir&s;t act of his imperatorial power was to detach his cavalry and chariots to harra&s;s the Romans on their march; and this &s;ervice they per|formed with great intrepidity, falling upon the enemy's hor&s;e; which however obliged them to give way and ab&s;cond among the woods and mountains, where, being acquainted with the ground, they rallied, attacked, and cut in pieces &s;ome &s;traggling Romans, who were too eager in the pur&s;uit. Not &s;atisfied with having made this undaunted effort, they afterwards ru&s;hed &s;uddenly and unexpect|edly from the woods, while the enemy were employed in fortifying their camp, and charged the grand guard with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that Cae&s;ar was obliged to &s;end a &s;trong body to &s;u&s;tain them; even then the couragious Britons forced their way through the intervals of the cohorts, and cutting their pa&s;&s;age back again, re|treated to their thicket, after having killed a number of Romans, and among the re&s;t, the tribune Quintus Laberius Durus.</P>
<P>Cae&s;ar's legions, inured as they were to danger, and familiar with death, could not help manife&s;ting their terror, at the headlong and almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible attacks of the Britons, and the &s;trange novelty in their manner of fighting, which gave them a great advantage over heavy-armed infantry, who could not pretend to pur&s;ue them when they gave way, and dur&s;t not break their ranks, or abandon their &s;tandards. Nor could the Roman cavalry fight them upon equal terms; for, they frequently retreated in &s;eeming di&s;order, to decoy them into the pur&s;uit; and when they were at too great a di&s;tance from the legions, to be pro|perly &s;u&s;tained, they leaped from their chariots, and a&s;&s;ailed them on foot: thus the danger was the &s;ame to the cavalry, whether they retreated or pur&s;ued. Be&s;ides, our i&s;landers never engaged in great numbers, but fought in &s;mall bodies, di&s;|po&s;ed in di&s;tinct &s;tations, with large intervals between them, that they might &s;upport one another occa&s;ionally, and tho&s;e that were fatigued might be relieved with fre&s;h reinforcements.</P>
<P>On the day after this ob&s;tinate action, they &s;hewed them&s;elves at a di&s;tance upon the hills, without manife&s;ting their former eagerne&s;s and alacrity in provoking the Romans to battle; but, at noon, when Cae&s;ar detached three le|gions, with all the cavalry, to forage under the command of C. Trebonius; they &s;uddenly poured upon the foragers from all quarters, and even charged the legions as they &s;tood in order of battle: but, they were immediately repul&s;ed with great lo&s;s. They were no &s;ooner put in di&s;order than the hor&s;e fell in upon them with &s;uch precipitation, as left them no time to rally, form, or avail them&s;elves of their chariots; &s;o that they were entirely routed with great &s;laugh|ter. The auxiliaries who had joined them from different corners of the i$$and, being di&s;pirited by &s;uch a &s;eries of defeats, took the fir&s;t opportunity of return|ing to their own dictricts; and after this period, the Britons never hazarded a pitched battle with the army of Cae&s;ar.</P>

<P>This pohtic commander, apprized of the retreat of the auxiliaries, re|&s;olved to penetrate into the confines of Ca&s;&s;ivellaunus, by cro&s;&s;ing the river

Thames at Coway near the Oatlands, where alone it was &s;aid to be fordable by infantry. When he arrived at this place, he found a great body of the Britons po&s;ted on the oppo&s;ite bank, which they had fortified with &s;harpened pali&s;adoes: they had likewi&s;e driven &s;takes of the &s;ame kind in the channel of the river, &s;o as not to appear above the &s;urface; a circum&s;tance of which Cae&s;ar was inform|ed by the pri&s;oners and de&s;erters.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e ob&s;tructions, he ordered his hor&s;e to ford the river, and the foot to follow without lo&s;s of time.

<P>Ca&s;&s;ivellaunus having by this time re&s;igned all hope of &s;ucce&s;s in regular en|gagements$ di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t part of his troops, retaining about four thou|&s;and charioteers, with whom he watched the motions of the Romans, and being perfectly well acquainted with the country through which they marched, attacked them occa&s;ionaly, when di&s;per&s;ed in foraging, or intangled in woods and narrow pa&s;&s;es, to the great danger of the cavalry, who dur&s;t not venture to reconnoitre the road, or make excur&s;ions to any di&s;tance from the legions.</P>

The young prince had e&s;caped his parent's fate by fly|ing into Gaul, and craving the protection of Cae&s;ar, who now re&s;tored him to his &s;ubjects, after having obliged them to deliver forty ho&s;tages, and provide corn for the army <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">The&s;e were the Ceni-magni, Segontiaci, Ancalites, Bebraci, and Ca&s;&s;i, inhabiting Surry, Hamp&s;hire, Berks, Oxford&s;hire, Bucks, and Hertford&s;hire.</NOTE>.</P>

This officer was accordingly provided with troops and in&s;tructions, and &s;et out on this important expedition. But, when he arrived at the &s;ea &s;ide, his &s;oldiers refu&s;ed to embark for an i&s;land which they con&s;idered as another di&s;tinct world; and this refu&s;al, which &s;eemed at fir&s;t &s;o unpromi&s;ing, contributed in the event to the &s;ucce&s;s of the enterprize: for, the Britons being informed of the mutiny, intermitted in the mea&s;ures they were taking to defend the coa&s;t, and afterwards, when the army of Plautius &s;ubmitted of their own accord to the orders of their general, they made a de&s;cent on the i&s;land without oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Caratacus and Togodumnus, fore&s;eeing the in&s;inuations of Beric at the court of Rome, had &s;ent thither amba&s;&s;adors to ju&s;tify their conduct, and de&s;ire that fugitive might be &s;ent back, in order to be puni&s;hed for his perfidy and rebellion: but, he had anticipated their re&s;entment, and &s;o artfully ingratiated him&s;elf with the emperor, that Claudius treated the deputies with in&s;olence and di&s;dain, refu&s;ed to deliver the Dobunian, and in his turn, demanded the arrears of the tribute impo&s;ed by Julius Cae&s;ar, which the Cattivellaunians had neglected to pay. This arrogant behaviour towards the amba&s;&s;adors, incen&s;ed Caratacus and his brother to &s;uch a degree, that they not only rejected his propo&s;al about the tribute, but likewi&s;e ordered their &s;ubjects, on pain of incurring the &s;evere&s;t penalties, to break of all corre&s;pondence with the Romans.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of &s;uch an open rupture, they naturally expected an inva&s;ion, and made preparations accordingly, which were now fru&s;trated by their confi|dence in the mutiny of the Roman army, which was remarkably ob&s;tinate and audacious; for, tru&s;ting to this ob&s;truction, which they deemed in&s;urmountable, the two Briti&s;h kings had withdrawn their forces into the interior parts of their dominions, leaving the coa&s;t open and defencele&s;s.</P>

Claudius immediately embarked at O&s;tium in the latter end of July, for Mar&s;eilles, from whence he travelled by land to Boulogne, then known by the name of Ge&s;&s;oriacum, where he took &s;hip|ing for the Briti&s;h coa&s;t, with a very con&s;iderable reinforcement, and landed &s;afely at the Portus Rutupinus, now called Sandwich.</P>

<P>The fame of the&s;e exploits, and the terror of &s;uch a numerous army, brought nations every day to his camp with offers of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, e&s;pecially from the Bel|gic Britons of that neghbourhood: but, none of the antient natives would give up their liberty, though the Iceni courted his friend&s;hip and were con&s;idered as allies: while Caratacus, at the head of the Ca&s;&s;ivellauni, &s;till kept the field, in hope of &s;eeing the Romans retire at the approach of winter.</P>

My pre&s;ent fate redounds as much to thy honour as to my own di&s;grace.

Exa&s;perated at this declaration, they redoubled their ho&s;tilities; they intercepted two auxiliary cohorts that were bu&s;ied in pillaging for the benefit of their officers, and by di&s;tributing the booty and the captives among the neighbouring nations, paved the way for a general revolt; when O&s;|torius<NOTE PLACE="marg">O&s;torius dies in Britain.</NOTE> died oppre&s;&s;ed with cares and di&s;appointment.

<P>Didius was &s;ucceeded in the government of Britain by Veranius, under the empire of Nero, and meditated mighty projects, which, as he had acquired great reputation in other employments, would probably have &s;ucceeded, had they not been anticipated by his death, which happened before he had time to undertake any enterprize of con&s;equence. This officer's place was filled by S$$tonius Paulinus, one of the greate&s;t generals of his time, the fir&s;t Roman who had pa&s;&s;ed mount Atlas, and penetrated with an army to the banks of the Niger. He glowed with emulation to rival the fame of Corbulo, the conqueror of Armenia, who&s;e glory he re&s;olved to eclip&s;e by his atchievements in Bri|tain.

but al&s;o the allies of the Romans had joined the other nations that were not &s;ubjected to their &s;way.

The Iceni, as being the mo&s;t deep|ly intere&s;ted in the quarrel, were the fir&s;t who declared them&s;elves openly; and their example was immediately followed by their neighbours the Trinobantes. Venutius was the next to join the malecontents; the parti&s;ans of his wife, for|getting their particular quarrels, and former amity with the Romans, united with their countrymen on this occa&s;ion: all the &s;ubjected &s;tates, and even the remote Caledonians, engaged in this confederacy; which was headed by Bonduica, who &s;oon found her army increa&s;ed to two hundred and thirty thou&s;and fighting men; &s;uch a prodigious number as they had never brought into the field upon any former emergency.</P>

<P>The Britons defended their liberties with &s;uch unwearied ob&s;tinacy, even in the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t terrible di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and &s;uch a number of troops was re|quired to maintain conque&s;ts of greater importance in other parts of Europe, that Nero would have recalled the Roman forces from Britain, at this juncture, had not he been a&s;hamed to give up the only province which had been added to the empire by Claudius, to whom he owed his own elevation. He therefore nominated Turpilianus to the command in Britain, and he could not have pitched upon a more proper per&s;on to revive the Roman influence in this i&s;land; for, in&s;tead of imitating the example of Suetonius, who&s;e &s;everities had rendered him odious to the people, and who was particularly dete&s;ted on account of his having de&s;troyed the &s;eminary of their laws and religion, he treated them with mildne&s;s and humanity; &s;o that their pa&s;&s;ions &s;ub&s;ided, their re&s;entments cooled, and the revolted &s;tates returned to their obedience <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e were the Iceni and their confede|rates inhabiting the middle parts of the i&s;l$nd, $word$ far north as Lincoln&s;hire, and we&s;tward to the Severne, through which the procurator Catus had made tho&s;e roads, canals, and other works de&s;cribed by Dr. Stukely in his f$r&s;t Iter.</NOTE>. <NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>His manner of government gave great &s;atisfaction at Rome, where, when he returned, triumphal honours were decreed to him by the &s;enate: and his &s;ucce&s;&s;or Trebellius Maximus pur&s;uing the &s;ame plan of conduct, the Bri|tons were gradually reconciled to the laws and cu&s;toms of the Romans. Ne|verthele&s;s, he grew in contempt with the &s;oldiers for his inactivity and ava|rice; and their in&s;olence broke out in tumults, encouraged by Ro&s;cius Caelius legate of the twentieth legion: &s;o that the propraetor was forced to compound the matter with the mutineers, who being indulged in all manner of licentiou&s;|ne&s;s, allowed him to maintain the &s;hadow of authority, until the beginning of the civil war, in the latter end of Nero's reign; when the auxiliary cohorts and cavalry de&s;erting to Caelius, he was fain to fly for protection to Vitellius, who had a&s;&s;umed the purple in Germany. <NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

This officer, during his admini&s;|tration, attacked at different times, and as often defeated the Brigantes, who were the mo&s;t numerous and powerful people in the whole i&s;land.

<P>The conte&s;ts for the empire among &s;o many competitors, had called off the attention of the Romans from the affairs of Britain; and, as their armies were engaged in more intere&s;ting di&s;putes, than could ari&s;e from the admini&s;tration of &s;uch a remote province, Venutius had taken this opportunity to revenge his old quarrel, by exciting a revolt among the Brigantes and other nations, who forthwith invaded the Roman province, and met with little oppo&s;ition, until the arrival of Cerealis, by whom they were entirely reduced; a conque&s;t that concurred with the victories he had before obtained in Gaul and Germany, to rai&s;e his character to the highe&s;t pinnacle of military reputation.

Immediately before he was appointed to this government, the Ordovices of Denbigh&s;hire and Flint&s;hire had &s;urprized and cut in pieces a body of Roman cavalry quartered upon their frontiers; and Agricola no &s;ooner arrived, than he a&s;&s;embled his army, and began his march into the enemy's country. They retired to their mountains, where they thought them&s;elves &s;ecure; but, no difficulty could with&s;tand his valour. He made them pay dearly for the petty advantage they had gained, and not only defeated and reduced the Ordovices, but al&s;o penetrated into the i&s;le of Angle&s;ey, which Sue|$onius had been con&s;trained to abandon.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion, being de&s;titute of boats to tran&s;port his troops, he ordered his cavalry to &s;wim acro&s;s the channel; an enterprize which a&s;toni&s;hed the inhabitants to &s;uch a degree, that they &s;ubmitted without having made the leaft oppo&s;ition <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">The$e are &s;till to be &s;een the remains of two Roman forts, one of which is called G$iceil, probably from the name of Agricola.</NOTE>.</P>

In the be|ginning of &s;ummer he took the field again, directing his march towards the north, where he &s;ubdued the Otodini of Northumberland, who had not yet &s;ubmitted to the Romans; and that he might not lo&s;e his &s;ummer conque&s;ts during the &s;everity of winter, he ordered a chain of forts to be built at proper di&s;tances; in which he left garri&s;ons to quell any commotions that might ari&s;e, and &s;u&s;tain one another occa&s;ionally, in ca&s;e they &s;hould be attacked <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e ca&s;tles afterwards con&s;tituted the chief &s;trength of Adrian's Vallum, which was no other than a tr$nch or parapet joining the forts together.

<P>He employed the &s;ucceeding winter in making further improvements<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 79$</NOTE> on the civil regulations of the province; and, by the elegance of his manners and in&s;inuating addre&s;s, made &s;uch progre&s;s in taming the barbarity of the Bri|tons, that they became enamoured of the Roman arts and magnificence, which they began to imitate with &s;urpri&s;ing emulation. They rai&s;ed &s;tately temples, &s;uperb porticoes, and public edifices of the Grecian &s;tructure; they learned and &s;poke the Latin language, which they formerly abhorred; they accu&s;tomed them&s;elves to wear the Roman toga, and looked upon that as a mark of polite|ne&s;s, which was in effect a badge of their &s;lavery.</P>
<P>In the&s;e advances to politene&s;s and effeminacy, they were encouraged and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Agr$cola, who, in the cour&s;e of a &s;ocial intercour&s;e with the chiefs and princes, made them acquainted with the comforts and conveniencies of life, to which they had hitherto been &s;trangers: he had previou&s;ly &s;ecured their e&s;teem and confidence by enli&s;ting their va&s;&s;als, of whom he compo&s;ed the aux|iliary cohorts, and giving the command of them to Briti&s;h officers: he per&s;ua|ded them to build public &s;tructures for the ornament of their country, and hou&s;es more &s;uitable to the dignity of their birth, than tho&s;e contemptible and inconvenient cabins in which they re&s;ided.

<P>In his third campaign, he advanced into the country now called Scot|land, as far as the river Tay, carrying the terror and novelty of his arms among nations hitherto unknown, who, though his army was expo&s;ed to the rage and inclemency of dreadful tempe&s;ts, never ventured to harra&s;s it in the march; &s;o that they were conquered as &s;oon as di&s;covered; and the&s;e conque&s;ts &s;ecured by forts &s;o advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated, &s;o artfully con&s;tructed, and &s;o faithfully maintained, that not even one of them was ever taken, abandoned, or betrayed. They were well &s;upplied with provi&s;ions and garri&s;ons, that maintained them through the winter, during which the &s;oldiers made &s;everal excur&s;ions and ravaged the country; to the inconceivable vexation and even de&s;pair of the inha|bitants, who hoped to gain in one &s;ea&s;on what they had lo&s;t in another.</P>
<P>The &s;ucceeding year he employed in extending and &s;till further &s;ecuring the conque&s;ts of the preceding campaign; for, he drove the enemy before him to the we&s;tern extremities of the i&s;land, and fortified the i&s;thmus between the

rivers Forth and Clyde, with a chain of ca&s;tles, by which the natives were ex|cluded from the Roman &s;ettlements, and as it were confined within the limits of another i&s;land.</P>
<P>In the fifth year of his expedition, he penetrated beyond the friths, and em|barking on board of a fleet equipped for conque&s;t and di&s;covery, &s;ailed along $he we&s;tern coa&s;t of Scotland, vi&s;ited &s;everal unknown nations, made de&s;cents in &s;everal places of the highlands, Hebrides, and Orkneys, and, in repeated engage|ments, defeated the clans who took arms in defence of their country.</P>
<P>At his return from this naval excur&s;ion, he quartered his troops in the part f Britain which lies oppo&s;ite to Ireland, with a view to invade that i&s;land, which he hoped to conquer with a very moderate force, in con&s;equence of the infor|mation he had received from an Iri&s;h chief, who having been expelled from his own country, fled to Agricola for refuge: but he was prevented from executing this re&s;olution by the envy and jealou&s;y of Domitian, who had by this time &s;uc|ceeded Titus on the imperial throne.</P>

<P>The &s;ixth campaign of Agricola was of all the mo&s;t glorious and important. Hearing that the nations on the other &s;ide of the Forth were in commotion, he re&s;olved to penetrate to the very northern extremity of the i&s;land, and ordered his fleet to keep pace with the march of his army along the &s;hore. He had not proceeded far in this manner, when he under&s;tood from the pri&s;on|ers, that the Britons of that country, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Caledonians, had a&s;&s;embled a va&s;t multitude of armed men, in order to di&s;pute his pa&s;&s;age; and that they intended to make irruptions into the lowlands with &s;everal di&s;|tinct armies, in order to attack the Roman &s;ettlements. Cautioned by this intelligence, he divided his forces into three &s;eparate bodies, that he might not be &s;urrounded by their numbers, or circumvented by their &s;uperior knowledge of the country.</P>
<P>He had like to have &s;uffered &s;everely by this di&s;po&s;ition, which was no &s;ooner communicated to the Britons, than they joined their troops again with incredible di&s;patch; and &s;u$pri&s;ing in the night the ninth legion, which lay at a di&s;tance from the army, cut in pieces the guards, and broke into the camp with incredi|ble impetuo&s;it$. Agricola, appri&s;ed of their intention, detached his cavalry on the in&s;tant to &s;u&s;tain the legion, and amu&s;e the enemy, until the infantry &s;hould arrive: &s;o that, when day broke, the enemy perceiving the &s;uccours advancing, would have wil$ingly retired; but, as they were now engaged in front and rear, they found them&s;elves obliged to maintain the battle, which was fought for &s;ome time with equal ob&s;tinacy on both &s;ides; till at la&s;t the enemy were con&s;trained to fly before the arms and di&s;cipline of the Romans; and perhaps that day would have terminated the war, had they not found &s;helter among their mountains, woods, and mora$$es, which were unknown and inacce&s;&s;ible to the victors.</P>

<P>They were not di&s;concerted by this defe$t, which they imputed to unfore&s;een accidents, rather than to the valour of the Romans, and re&s;olved once more to try the fortune of a battle: for this purpo&s;e they &s;ent all their wives and children into their $ortified towns, and a&s;&s;embled an army &s;uperior to that which they had at fir&s;t brought into the field; but nothing farther was attempted on ei$her &s;ide, during the remaining part of the &s;ea&s;on; and in the winter a Ger|man cohort, re&s;o$ving to return to their own country, &s;eized on two ve&s;&s;els, and p$t to &s;e$; but were driven upon the coa&s;t of Frie&s;land, where they were en|&s;laved.
<PB N="39" REF="480">
Soon as the weather would permit Agricola to take the field in the &s;uc|ceeding &s;pring, he ordered his navy to alarm the coa&s;t, while he him&s;elf began his march to the Grampian hills; on which he found the enemy po&s;ted, to the number of thirty thou&s;and, commanded by their prince Galgacus, who, in a pa|thetic &s;peech to his people, repre&s;ented, that &s;ituated as they were, at the extre|mity of the i&s;land, they had no re&s;ource but their courage, and that victory alone could &s;ave them from eternal bondage.</P>
<P>Agricola too judged it expedient to harangue his &s;oldiers, after he had drawn them up in order of battle &s;o as that the confederate Britons in his army &s;hould bear the fir&s;t &s;hock of the enemy's attack; the legions being placed in the rea$ to &s;upport this body, in ca&s;e it &s;hould be repul&s;ed. As for the army of Galga|cus, it was arranged upon the declivity of a hill, which it covered entirely, and the cavalry &s;kirted the plain, with the chariots of war in the front of their line. The Roman general extended his fir&s;t line to the right and left, that he might not be outflanked by &s;uch a multitude; he alighted from his hor&s;e and po&s;ted him&s;elf at the head of the legions. The battle began with &s;howers of javelins, which did but little execution on either &s;ide, though the Britons at this di&s;tance enjoyed an advantage, which they could not expect to maintain in clo&s;e fight, with their &s;mall targets and long pointle&s;s &s;words, again&s;t the offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive arms of the legionary &s;oldiers. Agricola therefore detached four cohorts of Batavians and Thuringians to attack them &s;word in hand; the&s;e &s;pringing for|wards with great celerity, employed their &s;hort pointed &s;words again&s;t the naked bodies of the i&s;landers, in &s;uch a manner, that a great number fell dead on the &s;pot, and the enemy began to fall into confu&s;ion. The re&s;t of the Roman ar|my profiting by this di&s;order, advanced immediately to the attack, and falling among them with great impetuo&s;ity, a terrible &s;laughter en&s;ued; while the cha|riots were rendered u&s;ele&s;s by the unevenne&s;s of the ground. The Briti&s;h infan|try, po&s;ted upon the brow of the hill, made a motion to attack the Romans$ who were by this time di&s;per&s;ed in the pur&s;uit of tho&s;e they had already routed; but, Agricola perceiving their de&s;ign, ordered part of his cavalry to advance and keep them in awe, and the re&s;t of his troops in the mean time completed the victory. Now a dreadful &s;cene en&s;ued. The wings were ordered to clo&s;e and flank the Caledonians on both &s;ides; then the carnage and confu&s;ion redoubled. They endeavoured to fly; but finding them&s;elves enclo&s;ed on every &s;ide, threw down their arms and ru&s;hed upon the &s;words of the Romans: the ground was &s;trewed with the mangled bodies of the dead and dying, and overflowed with the blood of tho&s;e that fell: yet, even in this extremity, the Britons did not fail to exhibit proofs of valour and recollection; for as they were repul&s;ed to the neigbouring woods, they rallied in &s;mall bodies, and fell upon tho&s;e who were too eager in the pur&s;uit. They made &s;everal efforts of this nature; till Galgacus, finding it impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;tore the battle, retired with the remains of his army, leaving ten thou&s;and men, that lay dead on the field; whereas the Romans lo&s;t but three hundred and forty. The fortune of this day was celebrated on one &s;ide in &s;houts of joy, with which the Roman camp re&s;ounded through the night; and on the other, bewailed with di&s;mal yells and lamentations that ecchoed from the mountain, while they examined the particulars of their lo&s;s, $owled over their dead countrymen, and endeavoured to carry off their wounded princes. Yet the darkne&s;s facilitated the retreat of the vanqui&s;hed, in which they

u&s;ed &s;uch diligence, that before day light there was not one to be &s;een; a gloomy &s;ilence reigned over the neigbouring hills; and di&s;tant clouds of &s;moke i&s;&s;u|ed from the Caledonian villages, which they them&s;elves had burned in the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of their de&s;pair; nay, to &s;uch a pitch of horror and frenzy did this prevail, that many chieftains ma&s;&s;acred their own wives and children, that they might not be expo&s;ed to the mi&s;eries of want, or be violated and en&s;laved by the in&s;ulting Romans.</P>

<P>ALL the inhabitant$ of Britain were not yet reconciled to the domi|nion of the Romans. Some even of the &s;outhern parts dete&s;ting the manners of their conquerors, who loaded them with grievous taxes, and tran&s;|ported the greate&s;t part of their youth to fight their battles in other parts of the

world, cho&s;e rather to for&s;ake their native po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, than maintain them on &s;uch &s;ervile terms; and accordingly a great number of them retired beyond the friths, where they lived independent, though poor, among the Caledonians, and $oined them in the &s;equel, when they made &s;uch dreadful irruptions into the Ro|man province, and ravaged the lands of their countrymen with fire and &s;word.</P>
<P>Their fir&s;t exploit of this kind was performed in the fir&s;t year of Adrian's reign; on which occa&s;ion they &s;urprized and demol &s;hed &s;ome of the forts which Agricola had built on the Ifthmus, and returned to their native hills laden with boory. The emperor being informed of this commotion, conferred the govern|ment of Britain upon Julius Severus, who was immediately recalled to be em|ployed el&s;ewhere; and as the Caledonians continued their incur&s;ions, the emperor re&s;olved to go thither in per&s;on, and tame the in&s;olence of tho&s;e ferocious i&s;landers, who could not be per&s;uaded to live in peace.</P>
<P>After he had landed in Britain, and proceeded as far as York, he met with &s;ome old officers who had &s;erved under Agricola; and the&s;e gave him &s;uch an unfavourable account of the country which he intended to &s;ubdue, that he laid a&s;ide the de&s;ign of penetrating into a &s;avage country, covered with impa&s;&s;ible woods, mountains, and mora&s;&s;es, the conque&s;t of which would be attended with great difficulty and danger, and at la&s;t yield neither glory nor advantage. He exerci&s;ed his &s;agacity and reflection in contriving mea&s;ures for pre&s;erving the peace of the province; and judging that the irruptions of the Caledo|n$ans, or Picts, proceeded from their being hampered for want of room, in &s;uch a narrow corner of the i&s;land, he ordered the ca&s;tles between the friths to be abandoned, and contracted the Roman province within the other line of forts built ai&s;o by Agricola, from Solway frith to the river Tyne. It was upon this occa&s;ion, as we have already hinted, that he rai&s;ed a &s;trong rampart of earth connecting the&s;e forts, extending ninety miles acro&s;s the i&s;land from ea&s;t to we&s;t. The &s;outhern parts being thus &s;ecured from in&s;ult, and the Caledonians indulged with plenty of ground, he returned to Rome, where he was honoured with the title of Re&s;torer of Britain, as we learn from &s;ome medals &s;truck on that occa&s;ion.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

The&s;e tidings being reported at Rome, the new emperor, Antoninus Pius, be&s;towed the command in Britain on Lollius Urbicus, who not only drove the enemy out of the northern parts of England, but even repelled them beyond the limits within which they had been confined by Agri|cola: he rai&s;ed a fortification almo&s;t in the &s;ame line, from frith to frith, and hard by e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;trong camp, in which he kept a body of forces to de|&s;end the wall and defeat the attempts of the Caledonians.

<P>Marcus Aurelius being &s;ucceeded by his &s;on Commodus, a flagitious wretch, unworthy of &s;uch a father, the management of affairs fell into the hands of worthle&s;s pimps and para&s;ites, who, laying a&s;ide the officers of abi|lity and integrity, who had &s;erved the late emperor, conferred po&s;ts and go|vernments upon profligate per&s;ons of their own &s;tamp, who had become nece&s;|&s;ary in&s;truments in their debauches, or purcha&s;ed their promotion with extrava|gant &s;ums of money; for which they indemnified them&s;elves by fleecing the people &s;ubjected to their government. Such prepo&s;terous conduct could not fail of being attended with a relaxation of di&s;cipline in the army, and di&s;order and di&s;|content in the provinces; of which the Caledonians taking advantage, a&s;&s;embled a &s;trong body of forces, broke through the wall of Antoninus, cut off the Ro|man general and all his troops, and filled the whole country with terror and de|va&s;tation. Commodus, alarmed at the ravages and &s;ucce&s;s of tho&s;e indomitable<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dio. l. 72.</NOTE> barbarians, appointed Ulpius Marcellus propraetor in Britain; and this com|mander being a per&s;on of uncorrupted morals, experience in the art of war, undaunted courage, and indefatigable vigilance, &s;oon re&s;tored the troops to their ancient di&s;cipline by his example and &s;everity; and defeated the Caledonians in &s;e|veral engagements with great &s;laughter, by which they were &s;o weakened and inti|midated, that they did not attempt another inva&s;ion during the remaining part of this emperor's reign. But the glory he acquired in this expedition, had like to have co&s;t him his life, through the envy and jealou&s;y of his ma&s;ter, who a&s;&s;umed the title of Britannicus on account of the victory the propraetor had won; and re|calling him from his government, &s;old his place to the be&s;t bidder. This in all probability was &s;ome low-born mi&s;creant, without weight or authority, who allowed the &s;olders to live according to their own plea&s;ure, regardle&s;s of di&s;ci|pline and re&s;$$ai$t, until, under a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the&s;e commanders, they degene|rated to &s;uch a degree of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, that a mutiny en&s;ued.

of fifteen hundred being &s;ent to Rome with complaints again&s;t the admini&s;tra|tion, &s;truck &s;uch a terror into the heart of Commodus, that he &s;acrificed Peren|nis, the commander of his praetorian guards, to appea&s;e their dangerous cla|mour; and be&s;towed the command of the province upon Pertinax, who after|wards a&s;cended the imperial throne.</P>
<P>Even this propraetor, with all his great talents, found it almo&s;t impracticable to reduce them to order and obedience; for, when he attempted to exert his authority, one of the mutinous legions took to their arms, and a tumult en&s;ued, in which a great deal of blood was &s;plit, and Pertinax him&s;elf left for dead upon the &s;pot. Notwith&s;tanding this mi&s;carriage in the beginning, he afterwards employed his indu&s;try and addre&s;s to &s;uch good purpo&s;e, that he effected a reformation; and although he made &s;ome &s;evere examples of the mo&s;t &s;editious among them, be|came a favourite with the army. Yet, he found &s;uch difficulty in conquering their aver&s;ion to exact di&s;cipline, that he de&s;ired to be recalled, and having at length obtained his reque&s;t, was &s;ucceeded by Clodius Albinus, who, though commanded to re&s;ign his office to Junius Severus, becau&s;e he had given offence<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> in a &s;peech he made to the army, on a fal&s;e report of the emperor's death, re|fu&s;ed to part with the government, and continued in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it at the death of Commodus, who was &s;oon after murdered in his own palace.</P>
<P>It was at this period that Pertinax a&s;&s;umed the imperial purple; and all good men rejoiced at his elevation, ina&s;much as his great abilities, and unblemi&s;hed character, promi&s;ed a wife, mild, and happy admini&s;tration: nor would he have di&s;appointed the expectation of his &s;ubjects, had he lived to exert tho&s;e ta|lents and virtues by which his character was di&s;tingui&s;hed; for this very rea&s;on his elevation could not but give di&s;gu&s;t to tho&s;e who knew their conduct would not &s;tand the te&s;t of inquiry. This was the ca&s;e with the praetorian troops, who not only expected to be puni&s;hed for their licentiou&s;ne&s;s, but al&s;o dreaded the pro&s;pect of a reformation, which in order to avert they murdered the new em|peror, at the immediate in&s;tigation of Didius Julianus, to whom they &s;old the imperial dignity. Perhaps this per&s;on, who had no other preten&s;ions than his wealth, would not have pre&s;umed to attempt &s;uch a purcha&s;e, unle&s;s he had been encouraged with the promi&s;e of &s;upport, by Albinus, who now command|ed in Britain, and looked upon Pertinax as his enemy.</P>

<P>Didius was no &s;ooner proclaimed emperor, than he found him&s;elf une|qual to the ta&s;k of managing &s;uch an unweildy purcha&s;e. His per&s;on and go|vernment were treated with univer&s;al contempt; and the arm$es that &s;erved in the di&s;tant provinces, incen&s;ed at the pre&s;umption of the praetorian band, who had rai&s;ed him to the throne without their knowledge and concurrence, de&s;ired their own generals to a&s;&s;ume the imperial purple. It was in con&s;equence of &s;uch im|portunities that C. Pe&s;$ennius Niger declared him&s;elf emperor in the ea&s;t, and Septimius Severus put on the imperial en&s;igns in Illyria. He had an advantage over his competitor in being near the capital, whither he marched without de|lay, and was acknowledged by the &s;enate, which had, upon his approach, given ord$rs for putting Didius to death. But he did not think him&s;elf &s;ecure on the throne wh$le Niger lived, and Albinus maintained &s;uch influence among the legi|ons of Britain. The la&s;t therefore, he cajoled with promi&s;es of &s;haring the empire with him, and in the mean time permitted him to enjoy the badges and di&s;tinc|tions

of his a&s;&s;ociate, until Niger was defeated and &s;lain; then he revolved dif|ferent expedients for di&s;engaging him&s;elf from Albinus, who&s;e promotion &s;tood in the way of his own family. No method &s;eemed more effectual and expedi|tious than that of poi&s;on, which he hired &s;ome a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins to admini&s;ter: but Al|binus being appri&s;ed of their de&s;ign, extorted from them a confe&s;&s;ion with the rack, and being convinced of his colleague's treachery, declared war again&s;t Se|verus, and a&s;&s;umed the title of emperor and Augu&s;tus. Con&s;cious of his own &s;trength and influence, he forthwith cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea, and gained the army on the Rhine over to his party; while Severus advanced at the head of his troops to de|cide the contention by force of arms: the&s;e two powerful rivals meeting in a large plain near Lyons in Gaul, a terrible battle en&s;ued, and continued a long time with doubtful &s;ucce&s;s, the Briti&s;h troops having charged with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity in the beginning, that Severus had like to have been wor&s;ted; but his general<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>Severus was no &s;ooner rendered by this deci&s;ive action &s;ole ma&s;ter of the empire, than he di&s;patched Virius Lupus into Britain, with the title of proprae|tor, to repel the Caledonians, who had made incur&s;ions even beyond Adrian's wall, during the ab&s;ence of the legions which had been tran&s;ported to the con|tinent by Albinus. Mean while the emperor him&s;elf remained in Gaul, where, among other regulations, he divided the government of Britain into two pro|vinces.

This treaty remained in full force and unviolated for &s;everal years, till at length, the northern Britons, tired of inaction, which might blunt their martial genius, or &s;timulated by wants which they could &s;upply by rapine only, made an irruption into the Roman pro|vince, with &s;uch numbers and impetuo&s;ity, that the propraetors, after having joined their forces and made divers un&s;ucce&s;sful efforts to &s;tem the torrent, were obliged $o &s;end to Rome for fre&s;h reinforcements.</P>

<P>Severus, alarmed at the di&s;tre&s;s of Britain, which was con&s;idered as the mo&s;t important province of the empire, re&s;olved to go thither in per&s;on; and, a&s;&s;embling an army without delay, &s;et out on the expedition, in his declining age, when he was &s;o crippled with the g$ut, that he was obliged to be carried in a litter; and that he might be able to &s;urmount every ob&s;tacle that could re|tard the entire conque&s;t of the i&s;land, he not only provided a &s;trong army of ve|teran troops, but on his arrival in Britain, he likewi&s;e prepared pontoons to be laid over mora&s;&s;es, and other military machines for clearing woods, opening roads, and rendering mountains acce&s;&s;ible; &s;o that the enemy &s;hould no lon|ger avail them&s;elves of the fa&s;tne&s;&s;es to which they u&s;ually retired from the pur|&s;uit of their conquerors.</P>

<P>The&s;e previous mea&s;ures being taken, he began his march, and advancing to|wards Adrian's rampart, found the whole country de&s;olated by the enemy; a circum&s;tance that did not fail to corroborate the re&s;olution he had already taken, to merit and a&s;&s;ume the glorious title of Britannicus, which had attractions &s;u|perior to all the glory he had acquired, and was in all appearance the chief mo|tive that induced him to undertake the conque&s;t of &s;uch a warlike people, in &s;pite of the dangers of the campaign, and the infirmities of old age, under which he laboured. As he penetrated into the country of the Caledonians, he employed his pioneers in laying it open; and indeed he could not u&s;e too much precaution of this kind again&s;t the efforts of tho&s;e northern Britons, who wi&s;ely avoided general actions with &s;uch an invincible army, but &s;eized all opportuni|ties of harra&s;&s;ing them in their march, and cutting off &s;mall parties that &s;traggled in que&s;t of forage or plunder. They followed the maxims of Ca&s;&s;ivelaunus, who allured the Roman &s;oldiers into bogs, thickets, and narrow pa&s;&s;es, after droves of cattle a&s;&s;embled for the purpo&s;e, and then fell upon them by &s;urprize with in|credible fury, after having cut off their communication with the army: in all probability the&s;e Caledonians were originally of the &s;ame race of Britons over whom that prince had reigned. They were armed and painted in the &s;ame man|ner: nor do they &s;eem to have degenerated in point of courage and fortitude; for they were accu&s;tomed to &s;wim through mar&s;hes, lakes, and rivers; they ex|po&s;ed them&s;elves voluntarily to the mo&s;t imminent dangers. They exerted their indu&s;try and valour to &s;uch a degree, in multiplying the perils and hard&s;hips of their invaders, that numbers of the Roman &s;oldiers, fatigued with hard duty, and di&s;tracted with continual alarms, intreated their comrades to put an end to their mi&s;erable lives, left they &s;hould fall into the hands of &s;uch a &s;avage enemy; and Severus is &s;aid to have lo&s;t fifty thou&s;and men in this expedition <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><P>The Ca$$d$nians were in all probability rendered more hardy than their &s;outhern pro|$$$i$ors, by the extreme cold and poverty of the country which they inhabited.

A revolt which incen&s;ed the old emperor to &s;uch a pitch of indignation, that ordering him&s;elf to be carried immediately to the camp, he harrangued the &s;oldiers upon the incon&s;tancy and perfidy of tho&s;e barbarians, whom, in a ver&s;e of Homer, he exhorted them to extirpate, without even &s;paring the child in the mother's womb. Having thus inflamed their re&s;entment, he inve&s;ted Caracalla with the command of this expedition; while he him&s;elf returned to York, where in a little time he ended his days. With re&s;pect to the war, his orders were very ill executed by Caracalla, who was more intent upon courting the favour of the army than in annoying the enemy; for, being per&s;uaded that his father was already on the verge of the grave, he had begun to form a party again&s;t his brother Geta. Nor was he di&s;appointed in his expectation touching the old emperor, the news of who&s;e death no &s;ooner reached him, than he renewed the peace with the Caledo|nians and Meatae; and having received ho&s;tages for the performance of articles, retired into the Roman province.</P>
<P>Severus bequeathed the empire to his two &s;ons, though Caracalla's great ambi|tion was to reign alone, and all his efforts were directed to this aim, which how|ever he could not accompli&s;h, at this period: the will of the old emperor was religiou&s;ly obeyed: the &s;oldiers took the oath of fidelity to Ba&s;&s;ianus (afterwards<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

But the elder, &s;till actuated by the mo&s;t furious ambition, and unnatural animo&s;ity, gra|tified tho&s;e pernicious pa&s;&s;ions with the &s;acrifice of his brother, who was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by his direction.</P>

<P>From the departure of the&s;e two princes, there is a melancholy<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

in who&s;e time thirty tyrants &s;prung from the corruption of his government. Six of the&s;e, namely Lol$$anus, Victorianus, Po&s;thumus the elder, Tetricus the younger, and Marius, &s;eem to have declared for them&s;elves in this i&s;land; at lea&s;t the number of their coins found in the neighbourhood of Colche&s;ter, en|courage this conjecture; and Porphyry the philo&s;opher, who lived in tho&s;e times, calls Britain a &s;oil fruitful in tyrants. The peace of this i&s;land might have been re&s;tored by Marcus Aurelius Flavius Claudius, the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Galienus, had not he been &s;uddenly overtaken by death, in the mid&s;t of his preparations for reducing Tetricus, who at that time ruled the we&s;tern provinces, and in all probability was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Britain. From his death we are acquainted with no Briti&s;h occurrence for a &s;eries of &s;eventeen years; till the reign of Probus, during which the imperial purple was a&s;&s;umed by Proculus and Bono&s;us (&s;aid to be a Briton) who laid claim to this i&s;land, Spain, and Gaul, and &s;eem to have been abetted by the natives of this country; but, their preten&s;ions &s;oon vani&s;h|ed before the fortune of Probus, who (we are told by Vopi&s;cus) permitted the Britons to cultivate the grape and make wine. But Bono&s;us was not the only per&s;on who rai&s;ed di&s;turbances in Britain during the life of this emperor. Another propraetor, who&s;e name is not a&s;certained, having been recommended to the government of this i&s;land, by Victorinus Maurus, prime-mini&s;ter and ge|neral in chief to Probus, renounced his allegiance, and &s;et up for him&s;elf; when<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$.

<P>In the reign of the&s;e colleagues, Carau&s;ius, a man of mean paren|tage, by birth a Menapian, or as others affirm a Batavian, having di&s;tingui&s;h|ed him&s;elf for his bravery and military &s;kill, obtained the command of the Ro|man navy &s;tationed at Boulogne to guard the &s;eas again&s;t the piracies and ra|vages of the Franks and Saxons, who about that time infe&s;ted the coa&s;ts of Gaul. Though he took a number of prizes while he exerci&s;ed this office, he neither made re&s;titution to the Roman &s;ubjects, who had been plundered, nor remitted any part of the booty to the emperor's trea&s;ury; nay it was ob&s;erved, that he never attacked the pyrates, until after they had plundered the coa&s;ts, and then be intercepted them when they were laden with the &s;poils of the count|ry. On $ccount of this conduct and the great wealth he had ama&s;&s;ed, which gave room to &s;u&s;pect him of harbouring more dangerous de&s;igns, Maximian Herculius gave orders for apprehending and executing him without delay; but Carau&s;ius being appri&s;ed of the emperor's intention, &s;ecured the fleet in his intere&s;t, and &s;ailed for Britain, where he was joyfully received and proclaimed emperor by the provincial troops, con&s;i&s;ting of one legion and &s;ome auxiliary co|horts; a $$re proof of the peace and tranquillity that prevailed throughout the whole i&s;$and: and this favourable reception put him in immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole Roman province, as far as the wall of Antoninus, which he repaired

and augmented. The next mea&s;ure he took was to conclude an alliance with tho&s;e Franks and Saxons, again&s;t whom he had formerly acted as admiral: he enli&s;ted a number of their troops, increa&s;ed his fleet with a great addition of &s;tout &s;hips, and being ma&s;ter of Boulogne, &s;upplied it with a good garri&s;on and all manner of nece&s;&s;aries, to endure a &s;iege with which it was threatened<NOTE PLACE="marg">$um.

<P>He found his account in the&s;e prudential &s;teps, which rendered him extreme|ly formidable; and his fleet having obtained a victory over the navy of Maximian, by which he &s;ecured the dominion of the &s;ea, the emperors, rather than expo&s;e the maritime ports of their dominions to the depredations of &s;uch a powerful enemy, con&s;ented that he &s;hould enjoy one third of the imperial dignity <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">This occurrence is authenticated by &s;$me $span$ of D$ocle&s;ian, Maximian, and Carau&s;ius, h$vi$g on the reve$&s;e PROV$DE$IIA AVGG. &amp; PA$ A$GG.

<P>By this pacification, Carau&s;ius reigned independent in Britain for the &s;pace<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$. Ch. 2$7.</NOTE> of &s;even years, during which he maintained the &s;overeignty of the main; and is &s;aid to have be&s;towed Scotland upon the Picts, as a recompence for their fidelity and a&s;&s;i&s;tance: this is the opinion of Geoffry of Monmouth and other Briti&s;h hi&s;torians, who alledge that 'till this period, the nation of the Picts was never mentioned by any writer what&s;oever; but, from comparing the relations of Cae&s;ar, Tacitus, Suetonius, Dio, Herodian, and others, who have recorded the tran&s;actions of this i&s;land, it plainly appears that the Ca|ledonians and Picts were the &s;ame people, originally de&s;cended from the &s;outhern Britons, who&s;e manners and cu&s;toms they retained; and that they were not par|ticularly di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Picts, 'till after the Britons of the &s;outh had, from their intercour&s;e with the Romans, adopted the manners of their conquerors, and laid a&s;ide the practice of painting their bodies, which was &s;till in u&s;e among the naked Caledonians; &s;o that the appellation of Picti was now appropriated to this nation.</P>
<P>As the peace between the emperors and Carau&s;ius, was the re&s;ult of nece&s;&s;ity, the troubles of Aegypt being appea&s;ed, and the Parthian and African wars fini&s;hed, Diocle&s;ian and Maximian Herculius conferred the dignity of Cae&s;ar upon their adopted heirs Maximian Galerus and Con&s;tantius Chloris, who married their daughters, and then divided the empire into four departments. The &s;hare of Con&s;tantius comprehending all the provinces on this &s;ide of the Alps, he appeared before Boulogne almo&s;t as &s;oon as the news of his elevation had reached the place; and having reduced the town, marched again&s;t the Franks, Cauci, and Fri&s;ians, who were in alliance with Carau&s;ius, whom he could not attack in Britain for want of a navy. The&s;e nations he &s;ubdued and tran&s;planted into remote countries, that they might not be near enough to ob&s;truct the exe|cution of the plan he had formed, for which a number of &s;hips were then build|ing under his own immediate direction. But in the mean time the object of his<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>The u&s;urper enjoyed his new dignity for three years, which elap&s;ed before Con&s;tantius found him&s;elf in a condition to invade the i&s;land: but a &s;ufficient navy being provided for that purpo&s;e, was divided into two &s;quadrons, &s;tation$d at different parts of the continent; in one of which he him&s;elf embarked, while

the command of the other was be&s;towed upon A&s;clepiadotus, an excellent &s;ea-offi|cer, who &s;ailing by the i&s;le of Wight, where the u&s;urper's navy lay, pa&s;&s;ed un|&s;een, by means of a thick fog, and landed without oppo&s;ition.</P>

<P>Con&s;tantius arrived at the very &s;pot where Alectus was po&s;ted to receive him with an army chiefly compo&s;ed of Franks and foreigners, who were extremely $$ious to the Britons; but either dreading to encounter an enemy of &s;uch repu|tation, or infatuated and di&s;tracted by the emergency of his &s;ituation, he, in&s;tead of attacking his enemy before they could be formed on the beach, advanced again&s;t A&s;clepia$otus, who was ready to receive him; and a battle en&s;uing, he lo&s;t the empire and his life; while a terrible &s;laughter was made among his foreign mercenaries. Tho&s;e who e&s;caped the carnage in this place, retired to London, with a view to pillage that city, from which they might be tran&s;ported to the continent in their own &s;hips that &s;till kept the &s;ea; but their de&s;ign was fru&s;trated by part of the Roman navy, which entering the river Thames, put them all to the &s;word. Mean while Con&s;tantius was received as a deliverer by the Britons, who had groaned under the tyranny of Alectus; and upon this oc|ca&s;ion he had a glorious opportunity of exerting his clemency, ju&s;tice, and di&s;cretion.</P>

<P>He granted a general amne&s;ty in favour of tho&s;e who had been concerned in the revolt: he ordered re&s;titution and all po&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction to be made to the &s;ufferers; opened the &s;ea, re&s;tored commerce, &s;ubdued &s;ome northern nations which had declared them&s;elves independent during the troubles, and recove|red the whole province of Britain, after it had been ten years di&s;membred<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

How&s;oever this i&s;land might have &s;uffered in other re&s;pects from the tyranny of Carau&s;ius, certain it is, the arts had flouri&s;hed during his u&s;urpation; the country was embelli&s;hed with magnificent &s;tructures, and the city of London, already con&s;iderable for its extent, beauty, and riches: &s;o that Con&s;tantius pitched upon Britain as the place of his re&s;idence; perhaps he was on this occa&s;ion influenced by his pa&s;&s;ion for the celebrated Helena mother of Con&s;tantine, and according to &s;ome authors a native of Colche&s;ter, while others affirm &s;he was the daughter of Coil, king of the Cumbrian Britons, inha|biting the countries between the walls of Severus and Antoninus.</P>
<P>Whatever may have been her family or country, &s;he was certainly a Briton and a woman of rare accompli&s;hments, who had long ago captivated the heart of Con&s;tantius, with whom &s;he was united in the bands of wedlock, though he had for rea&s;ons of &s;tate been obliged to repudiate her, on his marriage with Theodora daughter of Maximian Herculius, to whom he owed his elevation <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">What &s;eems to have mi&s;$ed &s;ome authors, who &s;ay, Helena was the concubine of Con|&s;tantius, was the law that$preva$led among the Romans, prohibiting all citizens marrying fo|reigners of what rank or degree &s;$ever; and every per&s;on was deemed a foreigner who had not been admitted to the jus quiriti$m et civitacis; which was the ca&s;e of the Latins and other Italian n$t$ons, before they were naturali&s;ed by the Julian law. But, though the nuptiae or connubium could not take effect between a Roman and a foreigner, &s;o as to be atte$ded with all the legal privileges of &s;uch a union, the matrimonium could be contrac$ed, without any impeachment of the honour and reputation of the parties; and that the mar|riage between Con&s;tantius and Helena was deemed valid in this re&s;pect, appears from the pains taken by Maximian to di&s;&s;olve it, before he intermarried with his daughter Theodora.</NOTE>. Notwith&s;tanding this match of convenience, Helena &s;till engro&s;&s;ed his whole $ffection; and by many public works which &s;he executed at her own expence,
<PB N="51" REF="600">
and other liberalities, acquired the love and veneration of the Britons to &s;uch a degree, that their e&s;teem amounted almo&s;t to adoration. Such a companion could not fail to compleat the happine&s;s of Con&s;tantius, who&s;e equitable and wi&s;e admini&s;tration was productive of peace and tranquillity to his &s;ubjects; and accordingly Britain enjoyed uninterrupted repo&s;e 'till his death, which happened at York, the place of his re&s;idence. <NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>His &s;on Con&s;tantine no &s;ooner heard of his father's indi&s;po&s;ition, than he artfully e&s;caped from Rome, where he had been detained by the jealou&s;y of the other emperors, and arrived at York to perform the la&s;t offices to Con|&s;tantius, who declared him his heir and &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the empire: and this di&s;po|&s;ition was &s;o agreeable to the army, that they proclaimed him emperor immedi|ately after his father's decea&s;e.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t care, upon his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, was to repel the Picts and Scots, who never failed to make incur&s;ions upon the Roman province, when they thought the imperial dignity u&s;urped or un&s;ettled by vacancies, fac|tions, or foreign di&s;putes; and tho&s;e nations being puni&s;hed and reduced, he rai&s;ed a con&s;iderable army to maintain his preten&s;ions on the continent again&s;t Maxentius, who had a&s;&s;umed the purple, and was actually in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Rome. The nece&s;&s;ary preparations being made, he tran&s;ported his forces to Gaul, where he conquered the Franks, who had by this time communicated their name to that country; then marching into Italy at the head of ninety thou&s;and cavalry, and four&s;core thou&s;and foot, gave battle to Maxentius, who was defeated and &s;lain.</P>
<P>Being now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the empire without a rival, he publicly em|braced the Chri&s;tian Religion, which he had long e&s;pou&s;ed in private; and his declaration on this &s;ubject was in all probability promoted by the ardour of the Briti&s;h troops, the majority of whom were pro&s;elytes to the doctrines of Chri&s;tianity, which now began to flouri&s;h in the conver&s;ion of a Roman emperor, who would have done honour to any religion he had profe&s;&s;ed. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the talents of a Julius, and the liberality of a Titus. He was brave, affable, elegant, equitable, and humane; and &s;o generous, that he often indemnified from his own pur&s;e, tho&s;e very people who had &s;uffered from the impartial admini|&s;tration of ju&s;tice. Far from &s;ullying by examples of &s;everity the glory of the victory obtained over Maxentius, he with a magnanimity peculiar to him|&s;elf, pardoned all who had fought again&s;t him, and re&s;tored the forfeited e&s;tates of his mo&s;t rancorous enemies: he recalled tho&s;e who had been exiled by Maxentius, re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the &s;enate in its antient &s;plendour and authority, and made &s;uch wi&s;e and effectual regulations to &s;ecure the peace and tranquillity of Rome, that in the in&s;criptions dedicated to his honour he was &s;tyled the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eutrop.

His authority, however, was of very &s;hort duration; for he died at Dada&s;tene in Bithynia, on his return to Con&s;tantinople, and was &s;ucceeded by Valentinian, in who&s;e reign the Roman province in Britain was reduced to the verge of ruin, by the inva&s;ion and ravages of its northern neighbours <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><P>Among tho&s;e people, who at this period &s;ell upon the Roman province, Marc$llinus mentions the Attacotti, who have been the &s;ub|ject of much di&s;pute and conjecture.&mdash;After all that has been &s;aid by Bucha$$an and the S$ot|ti&s;h writers in favour of the antiquity of their nation, it does not appear that the Scots had as yet any e&s;tabli&s;hed monarchy in Britain, from any of the Greek or Latin authors, who have &s;o accurately de&s;cribed the expeditions u$dertaken and executed by the greate&s;t captai$s of ant$q$ity, to the m$$t northern extremities of the i&s;land.

In con&s;equence of this repre&s;entation, corro|borated with other accounts de&s;cribing the deplorable &s;ituation of this impor|tant province, the emperor be&s;towed the government of it upon Theodo&s;ius, a general of great experience and con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;s in war, who was di&s;patched with a choice body of Roman and auxiliary forces. At his arrival in London, he found the country wa&s;ted and over-run by the Franks and Saxons, who had landed on the coa&s;t oppo&s;ite to Gaul, and were now di&s;per&s;ed in &s;mall bodies, plundering and burning the villages and plantations: he forthwith divided his troops into &s;mall detachments, and falling upon tho&s;e free-boot|ers encumbered with pillage, routed and cut them in pieces, before they had time to re-a&s;&s;emble; then re&s;toring the &s;poil to the right owners, returned in triumph to London, were he was received as an hero and deliverer.</P>

<PB N="55" REF="640">
When he enquired into the admini&s;tration of the province, he was not at all &s;ur|prized to find di&s;content and di&s;affection among the people: he therefore pro|mi&s;ed a &s;peedy redre&s;s of grievances; he publi&s;hed a general amne&s;ty and par|don to all the revolters who &s;hould repair to his &s;tandard; &s;ent for a celebrated ju&s;ticiary to pre&s;ide in the civil magi&s;tracy, and appointed Dulcitius, a comman|der of great reputation, as his lieutenant in the field.

<P>In the mid&s;t of all his glory and &s;ucce&s;s, he had well nigh fallen a &s;acrifice to a con&s;piracy hatched by one Valentinus, a native of Pannonia, who had been, for his turbulent &s;pirit and de&s;perate ambition, bani&s;hed to Britain, which was at that time a general place of exile; there a&s;&s;ociating with outlaws of the &s;ame &s;tamp, he formed the de&s;ign of &s;eizing the government, and had already de|bauched a good number of &s;oldiers from their allegiance.</P>

<P>Having pre&s;erved the public tranquility by this prudent method of proceed|ing, he was left at liberty to provide for the &s;ecurity of the barrier: he repaired the walls, repeopled the cities, reinforced the garri&s;ons, and re&s;tored the an|tient di&s;cipline of the army. The country lying between the walls of Severus and Lollius Urbicus, he erected into a &s;eparate province, which was denominated Valentia, after the reigning emperor, and ruled by a di&s;tinct deputy; and la&s;tly, he puni&s;hed an order of men called Areani, who though in&s;tituted to give no|tice of the enemies motions, had lately acted as &s;pies for the barbarians. The peace and &s;ecurity of the Roman government being thus re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, he re|turned to the continent, and was received by the emperor with all the honours due to his merit and &s;ervices; which the &s;enate likewi&s;e acknowledged, by de|creeing a &s;tatue to be erected to his memory, and placed among tho&s;e of their mo&s;t illu&s;trious ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>Though we do not know the particular methods he took to accompli&s;h tho&s;e great ends, we are a&s;&s;ured by Claudian, and Latinus Pacatus Drepanius, in his panegyric upon this great man, that he prevailed upon Valentinian to lighten the exorbitant tribute which had been impo&s;ed upon the Britons; and equipped a powerful navy, with which he maintained the empire of the &s;ea, and in parti|cular<NOTE PLACE="marg">Panegyr.

Nay, he took a more effectual method to &s;ecure the Roman province from any future inva&s;ion: he found means to detach the Picts from their alliance with the Scot|t$&s;h nation; which la&s;t was &s;o hard pre&s;&s;ed by a new confederacy of the Romans, Britons, and their old friends the Caledonians, that it was obliged to abandon the i&s;land and take &s;he$ter in Ireland and the le&s;&s;er Briti&s;h i&s;les, while a good par$ fled for refuge to the continent.</P>

The wall (he &s;ays) began at a village called Karedin, and extending two and twenty miles acro&s;s the $&s;thmus, ended near Kirkpatrick on the river Clyde; and was after this $rruption di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Graim's dyke, which it retains to this day.</NOTE> with any other materials than &s;ods and turf; nor indeed could it have been of great &s;ervice, had they been able to execute it in a more ma&s;terly manner, as the Scots had by this time plenty of &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, which they learned from the Iri&s;h to manage with great dexterity. By means of the&s;e they wafted them&s;elves over the friths in &s;hoals, and diffu&s;ed terror and de&s;olation over the whole country; &s;o that the Britons again applied to Rome for relief, and were again a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a &s;ingle legion, which, under the command of Gallio, compelled the enemy to retire with rout and confu&s;ion. But, the Roman empire on the continent, being by this time over&s;pread with an inundation of barbarous people from the north, the emperor could not afford to leave any part of his troops in Britain; and Gallio was recalled immedi|ately after he had repul&s;ed the enemy. This general, however, did not for&s;ake the Britons, until he had prevailed upon them to contract them&s;elves within the confines of England, leaving the di&s;trict of Valentia, which they could not de|fend, as a bone of contention to their northern enemies; and convinced them of the nece&s;&s;ity of repairing the wall of Severus, which was by this time lined with cities from &s;ea to &s;ea: he at the &s;ame time advi&s;ed them to build ca&s;tles on tho&s;e parts of the coa&s;t at which they chiefly apprehended inva&s;ions, and having furni&s;hed them with patterns by which they might fabricate arms for their own<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

XXXI. Before we clo&s;e this important period of the Briti&s;h hi&s;tory, we &s;hall give a &s;uc$inct detail of the progre&s;s which the Chri&s;tian religion had made from its fir&s;t dawn in this i&s;land to the pre&s;ent time, when the country was finally abandoned by the Romans. As for the account given by William of Malme&s;bury, concerning the tran&s;lation of Jo&s;eph of Arimathea to the church of Gla&s;&s;enbury, it bears &s;uch palpable marks of impo&s;ture, that we &s;hall reject it as a monki&s;h fable, unworthy of refutation. Neverthele&s;s, that the &s;eeds of Chri&s;|tianity were &s;own in Britain, even in the mo&s;t early age of the church, appears from the te&s;timony of Eu&s;ebius, an inqui&s;itive writer, in great credit with the fir&s;t emperor Con&s;tantine. He po&s;itively &s;ays that the apo&s;tles cro&s;&s;ed the ocean, and arrived at the Briti&s;h i&s;les; and Theodoret, who was a bi&s;hop in the fifth century, expre&s;sly mentions the Britons as a people whom St. Paul converted to Chri&s;tianity. An a&s;&s;ertion that &s;eems to be ju&s;tified by Clemens Romanus contemporary with the apo&s;tles, who gives us to under&s;tand that St. Paul preach|ed to the utmo&s;t bounds of the we&s;t, the common expre&s;&s;ion applied in tho&s;e times to the Briti&s;h i&s;lands. Whether this great propagator of the go&s;pel was ever per&s;onally in this country, or (which is more probable) &s;ent hither &s;ome of his di&s;ciples to preach the doctrines of his ma&s;ter, we may fairly conclude, that this religion had gained a number of pro&s;elytes, as early as the defeat of Bon|duica
<PB N="61" REF="700">
by Suetonius; for, Pomponia Graecina, wife of Aulus Plautius the legate of Claudius, had embraced it, and (as we are informed by Tacitus) was accu&s;ed of foreign &s;uper&s;tition. The example of a lady in &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed rank profe&s;&s;ing a religion &s;o pure and benevolent, could hardly fail to extend the doc|trine among the Britons, who were noted alike for innocence and docility. Nor was this in all likelihood the only fair patrone&s;s of this religion in Britain; for, there is great rea&s;on to believe that the Claudia mentioned by St. Paul in his epi&s;tles, was the &s;ame Briti&s;h lady afterwards celebrated by the poet Martial; ina&s;much as the apo&s;tle, in his &s;econd epi&s;tle to Timothy, takes notice of Claudia and Pudeus: and Martial names this very Pudeus as the hu&s;band of Claudia Rufina.</P>
<P>The&s;e, however, were only private converts to a new doctrine, which was not yet in a condition to cope with the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of the country; and tho' Tertullian, who flouri&s;hed in the reign of Caracalla, &s;ays that chri&s;tianity had made its way into Britain, we are not to &s;uppo&s;e the country in general was con|verted; for we learn from Xiphilin, that the promi&s;cuous u&s;e of venery &s;till prevailed among the better &s;ort of the inhabitants <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">The wife of a Briti&s;h prince named Argen|tocoxus, being rallied by the empre&s;s Julia, about the libertini&s;m of the ladies in Britain, who granted favours promi&s;euou&s;ly to different men; "True (&s;ays &s;he) we pique our&s;elves on obliging men of merit, and do with the bra|ve&s;t in public, what you practi&s;e with the ba|&s;e&s;t in private."</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We are informed by Bede, that in the reign of Marcus Antonius Verus and his brother Aurelius Commodus, while Eleutherus was bi&s;hop of Rome, that
<PB N="62" REF="710">
Lucius king of the Britons &s;ent an epi&s;tle to this pope, reque&s;ting his con|ver&s;ion to chri&s;tianity might receive the &s;anction of his holine&s;s; that he &s;oon reaped the fruit of his pious &s;ollicitation; and that his &s;ubjects pre&s;erved the faith inviolate in peace, till the reign of Diocle&s;ian.</P>
<P N="32">XXXII. Though &s;ome authors deny that ever any &s;uch prince exi&s;ted, be|cau&s;e he is not mentioned by the Greek and Latin authors who have recorded the tran&s;actions of tho&s;e times, the contrary opinion is &s;upported by &s;ome antient coins found in Cumberland and Durham, exhibiting a repre&s;entation of a cro&s;s, with the letters LVC; and Mon&s;ieur Bauterue gives us the print of another, re|pre&s;enting a man's head; and on the rever&s;e a boar and a &s;tar, the in&s;cription LVCIO. The&s;e circum&s;tances indeed amount to no more than a bare proba|bility; and that repre&s;entation of the cro&s;s, on a medal &s;truck &s;o early as the reign of Commodus, &s;mells &s;trong of monki&s;h impo&s;ition.</P>

<P>We do not find that the chri&s;tians in Britain were mole&s;ted in the exerci&s;e of religion till the reign of Diocle&s;ian, who being of a jealous di&s;po&s;ition, and fearing that the progre&s;s of chri&s;tianity would interfere with his authority, rai&s;ed a dreadful per&s;ecution again&s;t all the profe&s;&s;ors of this doctrine: a large &s;hare of the calamity fell upon Britain, in which the celebrated St. Alban &s;uffered martyrdom, in the manner related by Bede; and this was al&s;o the fate of a great many others, among whom Aaron and Julius are particularly mentioned.</P>
<P>This per&s;ecution raged in the beginning of the fourth century, and cea&s;ed when the government of Britain fell into the hands of Con&s;tantius Chlorus, who was favourable to the Britons, and not only encouraged them to come forth from the woods and caves in which they had lurked in the preceding reign, but al&s;$ permitted them to rebuild their churches, and renew the rites of the chri&s;tian wor&s;hip, which they enjoyed without di&s;turbance until they were in|fected with the Arian here&s;y.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XXXIV.</HEAD>
<P>That the church was e&s;tabli&s;hed in this i&s;land, &s;oon after the be|ginning of the fourth century, plainly appears from the hi&s;tory of the council of Arles, to which three Briti&s;h bi&s;hops &s;ub&s;cribed, by the names of Eborius, Re&s;tirutus, and Adelfius de civitate coloniae Londinen&s;ium. The two fir&s;t were the prelates of York and London, and the la&s;t is by U&s;her &s;uppo&s;ed to have been bi&s;hop of Colche&s;ter, though in all probability he ruled the dioce&s;e of Lincoln, which was called Colonia Lindi; and this la&s;t word, by a mi&s;take in the tran&s;criber, converted into Londinen&s;ium. The decrees of this council were &s;ent by the &s;ub&s;cribing bi&s;hops, to the pope at Rome; but, far from addre&s;&s;ing him as the &s;overeign of the church and vicar of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, they give him no other ep$thet in their letter than that of Dear brother: after having ob&s;erved that they were all united in one bond of charity and love, they &s;ay they were at the de&s;$re of their pious emperor a&s;&s;embled at Arles, where they &s;hould have been glad to meet their brother the bi&s;hop of Rome; but, &s;ince they could not enjoy that comfort, they had &s;ent an ab&s;tract of their canons, which he might publi&s;h through his whole dioce&s;e.</P>
<P N="35">XXXV. As the Briti&s;h bi&s;hops a&s;&s;i&s;ted at this a&s;&s;embly, we cannot doubt but that they were al&s;o &s;ummoned to the &s;ucceeding council of Nice, which was convoked by Con&s;tantine, who could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to overlook his own countrymen on &s;uch an occa&s;ion; though we do not know the preci&s;e number of tho&s;e who went thither, nor indeed of tho&s;e who were e&s;tabli&s;hed in Britain.
<PB N="63" REF="720">
We &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that all the prelates were conveyed, at the emperor's charge, to this council; which, among other decrees, e&s;tabli&s;hed the right of eccle&s;ia&s;tical election and juri&s;diction in the bi&s;hops, as well as the authority of provincial &s;ynods; and exempted metropolitans from the juri&s;diction of the bi&s;hops of Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch. Nor, indeed, is there any one in&s;tance in tho&s;e days, of a pope's con&s;ecrating Briti&s;h bi&s;hops, &s;ummoning them to coun|cils, hearing their cau&s;es, receiving appeals, or exerci&s;ing any legatorial autho|rity within the Briti&s;h dominions.</P>

<P>The bi&s;hops of Britain were likewi&s;e pre&s;ent at the council of Sar|dis, convened on account of Athana&s;ius, who had been condemned by the ea&s;t|ern bi&s;hops. It was at this period that the Roman &s;ee began to gain ground, and &s;ome decrees of the council &s;eem to favour its u&s;urpation. Yet even the&s;e very degrees prove, that it had no original &s;uperiority; otherwi&s;e to what purpo&s;e were they now made? Be&s;ides, this council, called Sardica, was guilty of divers unwarrantable practices; nor was it ever deemed occumenical by the chri&s;tian church.</P>
<P>As for the council of Ariminum, held in the middle of the fourth century, it was infected with Ariani&s;m; but for the honour of our country, it appears from the fragments of Hillary, that the Gallican and Briti&s;h bi&s;hops a&s;&s;embling at Pa|ris, after the council of Ariminum, renounced the decrees of that heretical a&s;|&s;embly, and confirmed the doctrines of the Nicene faith. Let it al&s;o be re|membered, for the glory of that pure and primitive church, that three of the Briti&s;h prelates, a&s;&s;i&s;ting at this council, were obliged to accept of the empe|ror's allowance, becau&s;e they were not able to defray the expence of their own maintenance, and too con&s;cientious to live upon their brethren.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="37" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXXVII.</HEAD>
<P>Though our bi&s;hops were extremely orthodox at this juncture, Britain was not altogether devoid of free thinkers; for, in the cour&s;e of this ve|ry century &s;he produced the noted Pelagius, who&s;e real name is &s;aid to have been Morgan. He was a man of acute di&s;cernment, and great &s;ubtlety in rea&s;oning. His doctrine, which at fir&s;t got footing in Gaul, was thence imported into this country, where it met with a favourable reception, and in all probability was the more readily embraced, as the author of it was a Briton, and a per&s;on of un|blemi&s;hed morals, and as it contained nothing repugnant to common &s;en&s;e, or the fundamental principles of the chri&s;tian religion <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">He maintained that man might be righte|ous without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of grace, which was be&s;towed in proportion to his virtue; that man could arrive at a &s;tate of perfection, in which he could $e no longer &s;ubject to pa&s;&s;ion or to &s;in; that there is no original &s;in; and that infa$t$ dying before bapti&s;m will not be damned.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, the progre&s;s of this here&s;y alarmed the Gallican church to &s;uch a degree, that they &s;ent over two eminent bi&s;hops to reclaim tho&s;e who had im|bibed &s;uch dangerous errors, and to confirm the re&s;t of the nation in their ad|herence to the true faith. The&s;e venerable mi&s;&s;ionaries were joyfully received by the clergy, and a public di&s;putation en&s;ued at Verolam, where the heretics<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bede, $. i. c. 17.</NOTE> were confuted, to the un&s;peakable &s;atisfaction of all orthodox believers.</P>

Far from practi&s;ing the le&s;&s;ons they had received from Gallio, they aggravated their misfortunes with unavailing com|plaints, which &s;erved only to augment and propagate their de&s;pair; and when
<PB N="65" REF="740">
they were driven to the nece&s;&s;ity of making immediate efforts for their pre&s;erva|tion, they acted with &s;uch &s;loth, &s;tupidity, and di&s;traction, as entirely defeated the purpo&s;es of their labour. The Romans had long ago deprived them of their princes, de&s;troyed the power and independency of their clan&s;hips, aboli&s;hed their old laws, cu&s;toms, and religion, gradually di&s;&s;olved the ties of &s;ubordi|nation and attachment, by which their ancient dyna&s;ties &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; and altered the whole form of their con&s;titution. All tho&s;e who had been concerned in the adm$ni&s;tration were foreigners, by whom they were now de&s;erted; &s;o that they found them&s;elves in the condition of a &s;hip deprived of her pilot, expo&s;ed to the mercy of the next tempe&s;t that may chance to blow. All their warriors had been tran&s;ported into foreign countries, where they &s;hed their blood in the cau&s;e of &s;trangers, while ruin poured over their own country, which their valour might have &s;aved. In a word, they had no chief of influence and capacity &s;uf|ficient to unite their councils, regulate their de&s;igns, and exert that authority which alone could oblige them to take proper mea&s;ures for the &s;afety of the common-weal. They were de&s;titute of arti&s;ts, and even of materials for the fa|bric of weapons to annoy the foe, and &s;o accu&s;tomed to range over their fore&s;ts, heaths, and mountains, that when cooped up in forts and ca&s;tles they drooped and langui&s;hed like captives in confinement, and &s;eemed to lo&s;e all &s;en&s;e of glory, and all &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition.</P>

<P>This defection was no &s;ecret to their enemies, who&s;e views and ambi|tion dilated accordingly. The union of the Picts and Scots, which was for|merly the ca&s;ual junction of petty clans, without order, di&s;cipline, or precon|certed de&s;ign, had now become a powerful confederacy of two warlike nations. Fergus, whom the Scoti&s;h writers call the &s;econd of that name, had arrived, from Denmark, in Braidalbin, with a great multitude of his countrymen, who were formerly expelled from Britain <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Giraldus Cambren&s;is &s;ays, that in the reign of Neil Na$gaillac, &s;ix &s;ons of Maud, king of Ul&s;ter$ &s;ailed from Ireland with a large fleet to the north parts of Britain, where they &s;ettled with the Scots who followed them in the expe|dition; and U&s;her is of opinion, that the elde&s;t of tho&s;e princes was Reuda, from whom this colony derived the name of Dalre$dini. They &s;ettled long before this period, in Cantire, Knapdale, and Lorn, to the north we&s;t of the frith of Clyde and ca&s;tle of Dunbritton, which was the &s;tronge&s;t fortre&s;s of the Britons inhabit|ing Strathcluyd; and were occa&s;ionally rein|forced from their native country, &s;o as to be|come &s;ix powerful clans, who probably joined the Picts, and fought as their allies, under their own independent chieftains, without being &s;ub|ject to any &s;upreme &s;overeign, until they were all united under the monarchy of Fergus, the &s;on of Ere. <BIBL>Top.

Di&s;t. 3.</BIBL></NOTE>; and to him re&s;orted an infinite concour&s;e of people from Ireland, who tran&s;ported them&s;elves in their curroghs, or &s;mall boats to Argyle, which was the country fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in Britain by tho&s;e adven|turers. Far from being mole&s;ted or oppo&s;ed in this migration by the Picts, it had been previou&s;ly concerted with tho&s;e people, who fore&s;aw in &s;uch a junction the conque&s;t of the whole i&s;land, or at lea&s;t the recovery of the province called Valentia, lying between the walls of Antoninus and Severus, which had former|ly belonged to them and their allies. They had (as we have already ob&s;erved) united their forces, and on divers occa&s;ions committed terrible depredations on the Britons; but had as often been repul&s;ed by the valour of the Romans: and Fergus had actually lo&s;t his life in one of tho&s;e engagements, leaving a minor to &s;ucceed him on the throne; &s;o that, in all probability, nothing of moment would have happened during the minority of this prince, had not the departure

of the Romans, and the well-known imbecillity of the &s;outhern Britons, en|couraged them with the hopes of an ea&s;y conque&s;t.</P>
<P>Elevared with the&s;e conceptions, they took the field in va&s;t numbers, and con|&s;idering the Britons as their a&s;&s;ured prey, &s;pread them&s;elves all over Lothian, in which they met with no oppo&s;$tion. Having then divided the &s;poil and the lands, according to the previous agreement and di&s;po&s;ition they had made, they penetrated into England, and renewed their attacks upon the wall, which was &s;o poorly defended by the Britons, that, in&s;tead of u&s;ing battering rams or other military engines for effecting a breach, they pulled down the inactive de|fenders with iron hooks, and then undermined the fortification at their lei&s;ure. Having thus opened to them&s;el$es a pa&s;&s;age, they ravaged the whole country with impunity, while the Britons fled before them to the woods and mountains; and as the la$ds could not be cultivated in &s;uch times of danger and di&s;tre&s;s, a dreadful famine en&s;ued, &s;o that their condition became truly deplorable.</P>

<P>In this emergency they had recour&s;e to Aetius, the celebrated general of Valen$inian, who had with great difficulty, by the dint of va&s;t abilities, both as a politician and an officer, prevented his ma&s;ter's empire from being over-run and de&s;troyed by the Huns and other barbarians, whom he had routed in &s;everal<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 447.</NOTE> c$co$$ters.</P>
<P>This gleam of &s;ucce&s;s encouraged the Britons to hope that &s;ome regard would be paid to their addre&s;s, which is &s;aid to have run in this mi&s;erable &s;train: <Q>&startq;To Aetius; thrice con&s;ul, the groans of the Britons.&mdash;The barbarians drive us to the &s;ea. The &s;ea drives us back to the barbarians; and between both, we have the wretched alternative of being murthered, or drowned!&endq;</Q>&mdash;Such, however, were the calamities of the Romans them&s;elves, &s;urrounded by myri|ads of &s;avage nations threatening to &s;wallow up their empire, that they could yield no a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the unhappy Britons; who finding them&s;elves totally aban|doned, began to collect courage from de&s;pair. Some of them indeed were &s;o ab|ject as to throw them&s;elves upon the mercy of the enemy, $o whom they &s;ub|mitted; but by far the greate&s;t part, who had retired to their mountains and $ora&s;&s;es, became inured to hard&s;hips, which &s;teeled their bodies, while they &s;ti|mulated their revenge. Convinced of the mi&s;chiefs that flow from di&s;union, they endeavoured to erect an authority under which they might act with more vigour and unanimity: but, tho&s;e among them who had any &s;ort of title to this pre|heminence, were &s;o factious, tu$bulent, and contentious, that no &s;ooner was a general or chief elected, than he fell a &s;acrifice to the ambition of his rivals. Neverthele&s;s, they made &s;everal &s;ucce&s;sful &s;allies upon their invaders, who were a$tually repul&s;ed by tho&s;e efforts of re&s;entment and de&s;pair; and had they known how to maintain and improve the advantages they gained, they would have had no occ$&s;ion to call in auxiliaries to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But, an extraordinary abundance, &s;ucceeding the famine by which they had &s;o grievou&s;ly &s;uffered, they indulged them&s;elves in riot and debauchery; &s;o that their minds bec$me ener|vate, and they degenerated into a total profligacy of manners, which, in&s;tead of<NOTE PLACE="marg">P$de. l. i. G$$as.</NOTE> being re&s;trained, was augmented and encouraged by the example of their clergy.</P>
<P>Such a relaxation in their morals could not fail of being attended with neg|lect, di&s;order, and national timidity: but, the&s;e were not the only mi&s;chievous con&s;equences of their luxury and abundance; they were vi&s;ited with a terrible pe&s;|tilence,

<P>In order to oppo&s;e the progre&s;s of the&s;e people, the Britons pitched upon Vortigern as their general and &s;overeign; a prince who is &s;aid to have rai&s;ed him&s;elf to the &s;upreme command by the murder of his predece&s;&s;or Con&s;tantine, brother to the king of Armorica.</P>
<P>Whatever the arts may have been which paved the way to his elevation, he was certainly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of very few good qualities, and had probably recommend|ed him&s;elf to a degenerate age by his immorality and extravagance. He was originally chieftain of the Silures &s;ettled in Radnor&s;hire; and had acquired &s;ome reputation by his warlike atchievements again&s;t the enemies of his country: though his martial genius by $word$ means appeared at this juncture, when, in&s;tead of exerting the natural &s;tre$gth of the kingdom, which, if properly applied, would have been &s;ufficient to &s;ecure it from the de&s;igns of the enemy, he placed his dependence upon foreign auxiliaries. By his weakne&s;s or knavery, he be|trayed his country into the hands of the S$xons, who had, for a century and a half, infe&s;ted the coa&s;t of Britain to &s;uch a degree, that the Roman emperors, from the reign of Dioele&s;ian, maintained a con&s;iderable military force, under the count of the Saxon &s;hore, on purpo&s;e to &s;ecure this i&s;land again&s;t the de&s;cents of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rer. Fre&s;. Hi&s;t. Bede l. v. Sir W. Temple's ob&s;. on the United Provinces.</NOTE> tho&s;e piratical adventurers. Their name they owed either to their original de|&s;cent from the Sacae, or to the &s;hort &s;words, ter$ed Sacks or Sceach, which they u&s;ed in battle. They inhabited Jutland, Angelen, and Hol&s;tein, in conju$c|tion with the Jutes and Angles, who joined them in this expedition, and &s;hared the conque&s;t of Britain, in which likewi&s;e the Fri&s;$$ns were principally concerned.</P>
<P N="5">V. Vortigern. exclu&s;ive of his fear, was influen$ed by other motives to &s;ollicit the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e rovers. He had been concerned in the murder of &s;ome Roman deputies, who were left in Britain after the departure of Gallio; and he was afraid of being depo&s;ed and puni&s;hed for this outrage, &s;hould that people triumph over the barbarous nations, and reclaim the Briti&s;h province: be&s;ides, he dreaded the intere&s;t and preten&s;ions of Ambro&s;ius, a young prince de&s;cended from a Roman family, which had given &s;overeigns to &s;ome parts of this i&s;land, and now re&s;iding in Armorica, to which he had fled from the villainy of Vor|tigern, by whom his father had been a&s;&s;a&s;&s;mated. The&s;e were &s;ufficient induce|ments<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gildas. Nennius Hi&s;t.

Having thus artfully prepared their minds for the propo&s;al, he &s;ummoned them to a general council, on pretence of deliberating upon the nece&s;&s;ity of the &s;tate, and there managed their pa&s;&s;ions with &s;uch dex|terity, that they inve&s;ted him with full power to invite the Saxons into England, and a&s;&s;ign to them the i&s;le of Thanet for their habitation.</P>

Tho&s;e brothers had formerly, in the cour&s;e of their naval expeditions, landed in Britain, and been ho&s;pitably received by Vortigern, who, perhaps, took that opportunity of concerting with them the plan of their future operations.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A$. Ch. 452.</NOTE> Be that as it will, they, in con&s;equence of the &s;olemn invitation received from that prince, arrived with an incon&s;iderable number, not exceeding fifteen hundred men, and landed at Ebs-flete in the i&s;le of Thanet, where they did not long remain inactive. Vortigern being hardly pre&s;&s;ed by his enemies from the north, at that very juncture the Sax$ns jo$ned his army, which was not a little in&s;pirited by the arrival of &s;uch auxiliaries, and marched again&s;t the Scots and Picts, who had advanced as far as Stamford in Lincoln|&s;hire: a battle en&s;ued, in which the darts and lances of the enemy were found unequal to the axes and &s;cymitars of the Saxons and the Britons, who obtain|ed a complete victory, and recovered all the booty which the vanqui&s;hed had acquired.</P>
<P>After this action, the Saxons returned to the place appointed for their re&s;i|dence, and were &s;upplied with food and raiment at the expence of Vortigern, who would have had no cau&s;e to repent of their arrival, could he have kept their number from increa&s;ing. But their own country was &s;o populous and barren, and the fertile lands of Britain &s;o agreeable and alluring, that, in a very little time, the brothers were reinforced by five thou&s;and of their countrymen, who arrived in eighteen ve&s;&s;els, with their wives and families. The&s;e were aug|mented by daily &s;re&s;h &s;upplies to &s;uch a formidable number, that the Britons be|gan to &s;ee the danger of the &s;tep they had taken; and after having expo&s;tulated with their mercenaries on the breach of the contract, which re&s;tricted them to a certain number, de&s;ired them, in a very peremptory manner, to go in que&s;t of another habitation.</P>

<P>At the &s;ame time they loudly exclaimed again&s;t the tyrant Vortigern, for having introduced &s;uch an in&s;atiable crew into their country; and Hengi&s;t, who was endowed with a great &s;hare of cunning and di&s;cernment; did not fail to profit by this &s;pirit of di&s;content and di&s;affection. He expatiated to that prince, on the danger to which he was expo&s;ed from the hatred of his &s;ubjects, the claim of Ambro&s;ius, and the very neighbourhood of the enemy; he repre|$ented the nece&s;&s;ity of maintaining his government by means of foreign auxilia|r$s; he in&s;inuat$d him&s;elf into his confidence and e&s;teem; and la&s;tly, demon|&s;trated that the handful of Saxons under his command, could be of little &s;ervice to him, in ca&s;e of dome&s;tic troubles or inva&s;ion.

They there|fore demanded that tho&s;e grievances &s;hould be immediately redre&s;&s;ed, otherwi&s;e they would do them&s;elves ju&s;tice; and in the mean time they engaged in a treaty with the Picts, that they might be in a condition to cope with the whole power of the Briti&s;h nation.

What part Vortigern acted on this occa&s;ion is uncertain; but, in all probability, he remain|ed in a &s;tate of neutrality, owing to the importunities and influence of his Saxon wife. For this rea&s;on he was grown into &s;uch contempt with his &s;ubjects, that they transferred their allegiance to his &s;on Vortimer, the fruits of his fir&s;t marri|age, and taking up arms under the banner of this active prince, defeated the Saxons at Derwent, before they could reap any benefit from their northern alli|ance. The next battle was fought at Aylesford in Kent, with equal ob&s;tinacy on both &s;ides, Hor&s;a being killed by Vortimer, who&s;e brother Cautigern had fallen by the hands of that Saxon chief; and both armies claimed the victory, though neither had rea&s;on to boa&s;t of their &s;ucce&s;s. The remaining part of the campaign produced nothing but &s;light &s;kirmi&s;hes; and the &s;ea&s;on being far advanced, Hengi&s;t made a voyage to his own country, to negociate a reinforcement that might enable him to take the field in the &s;pring, with a good pro&s;pect of advan|tage.

Tho&s;e two nations had already begun to be infected with mutual jealou&s;y and di&s;tru&s;t, and many di&s;putes had happened between them about the divi&s;ion of the lands and plunder which they had ravi&s;hed from the Britons; &s;o that their friend&s;hip was in the wane, when Ambro&s;ius made his propo&s;als to the Scots, who found them too advantageous to be rejected.

Thus he laid the foundation of the kingdom of the South Saxons, which afterwards included the fore&s;t, together with the greate&s;t part of Surrey: but, this monarchy was not e&s;tabli&s;hed without great difficulty and blood&s;hed; for, the Britons would not part with their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions till after an ob&s;tinate oppo&s;ition, in the cour&s;e of which they &s;ought &s;everal battles with various &s;ucce&s;s, particularly that of Maer-credes-burn, where they were commanded by Ambro&s;ius, who, though<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sa$.

<P>From this period there is an interval of five years, during which we find no tran&s;action of hi&s;torical authenticity; but, this was &s;ucceeded by a very remarkable event, namely the arrival of a Saxon chief called Cerdic and his &s;on Cynric, who, with a body of troops, embarked in five &s;hips, arrived at a place &s;ince known by the name of Cerdic&s;hore, which Camden &s;uppo&s;es to be Cerdic$and, near Yarmouth in York&s;hire; but Matthew of We&s;tmin&s;ter more judiciou&s;ly places it on the we&s;tern coa&s;t, in the neighbourhood of Dor&s;et and Hants, which with &s;ome of the adjoining counties formed the &s;cene of his con|que&s;ts. He was oppo&s;ed on the very fir&s;t day of his landing by the Britons, who attacked him with their u&s;ual impetuo&s;ity, but were repul&s;ed towards night; and as they did not appear next day, he extended his quarters along the &s;hore. They did not, however, lay a&s;ide their de&s;ign of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing this invader, but harra&s;&s;ed him in an unintermitting war of five and twenty years, in the cour&s;e of which he mu&s;t have abandoned the footing he had gained, unle&s;s he had been powerfully a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his countrymen already &s;ettled in Britain, and &s;up|plied with &s;trong reinforcements from Germany. One of the&s;e was conducted by Porte, with his &s;ons Bieda and Megla, who made their fir&s;t de&s;cent at Port|land or Porte&s;ham, near Abbot&s;bury in Dor&s;et&s;hire, and &s;u&s;tained a vigorous at|tack from the natives, commanded by a young nobleman, who lo&s;t his life in the engagement.</P>

Thus reinforced, he formed his army into two divi&s;ions, one of which he led in per&s;on, giving the command of the other to his &s;on Cynric, and advanced again&s;t the Britons, in order to terminate the war by one deci&s;ive battle.

<P>It was at this period that the celebrated Arthur appeared with &s;uch dignity upon the &s;tage, and revived the drooping &s;pirits of his countrymen. This prince, of whom &s;uch miraculous exploits are recorded, is of &s;uch ob&s;cure original, that &s;ome authors &s;uppo&s;e him to be the &s;on of this Nathan Leod; others alledge his father was Uther Pendragon, brother of Ambro&s;ius: but he is generally thought to be of Corni&s;h extraction, and &s;on of Gurlois king of that province: this is the opinion of the Wel&s;h authors, who &s;ay he was born at Tin|dangel, and &s;overeign of that county alone, while other hi&s;torians affirm, that his dominion extended over all the Britons. Both the&s;e allegations may be true, if we &s;uppo&s;e his hereditary power was confined to Cornwal, and that he was elected to the &s;upreme command, like his predece&s;&s;ors, who reigned over all the Britons without exception. If we embrace this conjecture, we cannot help giving credit to Malme&s;bury, who affirms that he had &s;erved as general under Ambro&s;ius; and &s;urely, the Britons could not pitch upon a more proper per&s;on for the &s;overeign &s;way, than a prince of Arthur's heroic genius, who had been trained to war in their armies, and in all probability was at hand to collect their &s;cattered forces, and take immediate mea&s;ures for repairing the damage they had &s;u&s;tained. In this &s;tation, he exerted him&s;elf with &s;uch bravery and conduct, that, according to Nennius and the mo&s;t authentic hi&s;torians, he wor&s;t|ed the Saxons in twelve &s;ucce&s;&s;ive battles; though the&s;e &s;eem to have been in|con&s;iderable &s;kirmi&s;hes, in which the Briti&s;h prince acquired more glory than ad|vantage; for the &s;cene of the war was con$$ned to Lincoln&s;hire and part of Wales; and the Saxons, notwith&s;tanding all tho&s;e checks, pro&s;ecuted the war with &s;uch vigour and per&s;everance, that Arthur was &s;ain at la&s;t to conclude a treaty, by which he yielded to Cerdic the counties of Hants and Somer&s;et, which<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> were afterwards erected into the kingdom of We&s;&s;ex <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">The detail of this hero's &s;uppo&s;ed atchieve|ments$ in G$offry of Monmouth, is an extra|vag$nt ill con$$ved romance, more worthy of the invention of a Wel&s;h bard, like Talie&s;&s;in, than of the pen of an authentic hi&s;torian.</NOTE>.</P>

Mercia, founded by Crida, de&s;cended from Withelig the &s;e|cond &s;on of Woden, comprehended the country from the Severn ea&s;tward to Lanca&s;hire and York&s;hire, without encro$ching upon Norfolk, Suffolk, and Cambridge&s;hire, which compo&s;ed the kingdom of the Ea&s;t Angles.

<P>After this encounter, Ceaulin's forces, under the command of his brother Cutha or Cuthol$, advancing as far as Bedford, fought the battle which decided the fate of Mercia; for the Britons being defeated, had no alternative but that of &s;ubmitting quietly or abandoning their country. Cutha's victory being followed by the reduction of Leighton, Ayle&s;bury, Ben&s;ington, and Eigne&s;ham, which were towns of importance, Ceaulin &s;oon made him&s;elf ma&s;|ter of the Vale of Bucks, and all Oxford&s;hire. Then he undertook the conque&s;t of Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, and fought a very bloody battle with the Britons at Derham, near Marsfield, where they were defeated, and three of their princes &s;lain; and the cities of Bath, Cirence&s;ter, and Glouce&s;ter, &s;ubmitted to the conqueror.

The ferocious di&s;po&s;ition of Ceaulin rendered him as odious to his own &s;ubjects, as he was dete&s;ted by Ethelbert, king of Kent, who had not laid a&s;ide the hope of retrieving the former importance of his family. He therefore fomented the di&s;$ontent of Ceau|lin's &s;ubjects, until it broke out in an open rebellion, headed by his own nephew Ceolric, &s;on of the brave Cuthulf, lately decea&s;ed, and even engaged the Bri|tons and Scots in his con&s;ederacy, by flattering them with the hope of revenging them&s;elves upon the tyrant. They joined forces therefore, and advancing to Wod|ne&s;burg, or Wantborough in Wilts, gave battle to Ceaulin, who being def$ated, fled from his dominions and died in exile, while his kingdom devolved to Ceola, and Ethelbert was declared chief of the Saxon confederacy. <NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

He married Bertha, daughter of Cherebert, king of Paris; an alliance, which while it gratified his pride, added lu&s;tre and importance to his character at home; &s;o that he was en|abled to exerci&s;e a kind of tyrannical dominion over the Saxons, who were &s;et|tled to the &s;outhward of the Humber.

<P>Before we proceed with the hi&s;tory of that period which begins with the conver&s;ion of the Briti&s;h Saxons to Chri&s;tianity, the reader will expect that &s;ome account &s;hould be given of the di&s;putes and troubles in which the chri&s;tian church was involved, from the departure of the Romans to the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of the Saxon heptarchy; we &s;hall therefore in this p$ace, in&s;ert a brief ab&s;tract of tho&s;e tran&s;actions.</P>
<P>We are informed by the venerable Bede, that St. Germanus and Lupus, who had re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the true $aith at Verolam by their teaching, preaching, and work|ing of miracles, were no &s;ooner departed from the i&s;land, than Pel$giani&s;m be|gan to revive, and regained with &s;uch rapidity the ground it had lo&s;t, that ano|ther application was made to St. Germanus, who, in conj$nction with Se|verus, bi&s;hop of Triers, returned to Britain, and p$rformed &s;uch a miraculou$ cure upon the lame &s;on of a nobleman, called Elathius, that the people were convinced of their being the cho&s;en mi&s;&s;ionaries of God, and the chief profe&s;&s;ors of Pelagiani&s;m were bani&s;hed from their country. Then the holy Germanus in|&s;tituted &s;chools of learning, under the in&s;pection of per&s;ons $minent for their abilities. Dubricius taught in $ne of the&s;e &s;eminaries at Lan$aff; another was &s;uperintended by one Daniel; and $ltutus kept a great &s;chool at Lantuit in Gla|morgan&s;hire, where a great number of the Briti&s;h nobility rec$ived their edu|cation.
<PB N="80" REF="890">
As for Dubri$ius, he was fir&s;t created bi&s;hop of Landaff, and af$er|wards con&s;ecrated archbi&s;hop of Kaer-leon or Che&s;ter, from whence he transferred the metropol$tan &s;ee to Landaff. He erected twelve mona&s;teries, and taught his monks to earn their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence with the labour of their hands. He is &s;aid to have been con&s;ecrated by Germanus and Lupus. Aurelius Ambro&s;ius confirmed his election: on that prince's death, he inve&s;ted Uther and afterwards Arthur<NOTE PLACE="marg">S$e$m$n's $word$ of $span$ of $word$.</NOTE> with the en&s;igns of royalty; and la&s;tly, retired to an hermitage, where he ended his days$ after having re&s;igned the pomp of the archbi&s;hopric.</P>

<P>From the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of Chri&s;tianity in this i&s;land, there were three archbi&s;hopricks, namely, of York, London, and Caer-leon, to whom eight and twenty bi&s;hops or flamens were &s;ubject.

<P>Dubricius had one place of &s;tudy on the river Wey, and another at Mo&s;hro&s;s, and is &s;aid to have in&s;tructed a thou&s;and di&s;ciples, among whom were St. Theli|aus, Sam&s;on, Idanus, and other di&s;tingui&s;hed characters. Nor was Iltutus le&s;s eminent for the number and quality of his pupils, among whom we number Sam&s;on, archbi&s;hop of Dole in Brittany; Paul, bi&s;hop of the Oxi&s;mii, a &s;ee comprehending the dioce&s;es of Treguier, St. Pol, and St. Brieu; and at this period, Britain flouri&s;hed in civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical learning.</P>
<P>The mona&s;tery of Banchor or Bangor was another &s;eminary that gave ma|ny valuable men to the church, and was &s;o populous, as we are informed by $$de, that when the monks were &s;eparated into &s;even divi&s;ions, each contained three hundred brothers, that maintained them&s;elves by the labour of their hands: one hundred of the&s;e were appointed to perform divine &s;ervice, at one time; and were &s;ucceeded by an equal number in rotation; &s;o that it continued the<NOTE PLACE="marg">B$de.</NOTE> whole day without intermi&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>The fir&s;t Wel&s;h council of the clergy, was a&s;&s;embled in order to take cogni|zance of Vortigern's pro$$igacy, after that prince had been doomed to de&s;truction by the prophecies of Merlin; and they &s;eemed to have rai&s;ed Aurelius Ambro|&s;ius<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$ Ch. 465.</NOTE> to the throne by their &s;ole power and influence.</P>
<P>The next occa&s;ion for which the Briti&s;h &s;ynod a&s;&s;embled, was the con&s;ecration of St. Dubricius and Theliaus, the fir&s;t of whom was elected archbi&s;hop of K$$r-leon$ and the other bi&s;hop of Landaff, though not without the con&s;ent or<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$ Ch 51$.</NOTE> the &s;overeign.</P>

Mor$ant, and Frioc his uncle, two petty princes of Wales, had, according to the fa&s;hion of the times, &s;olemnly &s;worn in pre&s;ence of St. Oudoceus and his clergy, that if ever the one &s;hould murther or betray the other, the offender &s;hould not have it in his power to commute his crime for gold or &s;ilver, but re&s;ign the government of his king|dom, and end his days in pilgrimage. This oath was &s;oon violated by Mor|cant, who murdered his uncle; and then de&s;ired he might buy off the penalty from the church of Landaff. The ca&s;e was debated in full &s;ynod at Landaff; and he was ab&s;olved on promi&s;e of fa&s;ting, praying, and giving alms; that the government might not &s;uffer by his ab&s;ence, as they had no power to create a new king. This decree not only implies the limited power of the clergy, but is a &s;ure mark of the independency of the Briti&s;h church, which thus proceeded to exert the la&s;t &s;troke of &s;acerdotal authority without the &s;anction of Rome, or any pretended &s;uperiority of eccle&s;ia&s;tic juri&s;diction, to which no delinquent ever dreamed of appealing from the cen&s;ure of our own prelates.</P>

&s;ame prelate, upon a &s;imilar &s;ubject.

<P>The chri&s;tian religion, if we may believe Gildas, never &s;uffered more per&s;ecution than it underwent in Britain, from the barbarity of the Saxon pagans, who burned all the ci$ies and churches to the ground from &s;ea to &s;ea, and &s;tained the altars with the blood of the clergy, after having ma&s;&s;acred all tho&s;e whom they found in the exerci&s;e of the chri&s;tian religion.

It has been a con&s;tant remark in all ages, that no quarrel rages to &s;uch a pitch of cruelty and outrage, as that which is inflamed with an ingredient of religion. The Saxons were con&s;idered, not barely as enemies and invaders of the Britons, but as impious pagans and idolaters, who came to de&s;troy the faith, and &s;eize the lands of the clergy. The&s;e were &s;uch aggravations of ho&s;tile intent, that even when the Britons found them&s;elves altogether unable to cope with the intruders, the prie&s;ts would not allow them to &s;ubmit; but wound them up to an enthu&s;ia&s;tic fury, which prompted them to ru&s;h upon the &s;words of their enemies; and all that peri&s;hed by their own madne&s;s, were accounted martyrs to their religion.</P>

Before his elevation to the po$ti$icate, he chanced one day to pa&s;s through the &s;lave market, where ob&s;erv|ing &s;ome young men, of engaging a&s;pects, &s;tanding ready to be &s;old to the be&s;t $idder, he inquired about their country, and finding they were Engli&s;h pagans, was &s;eized with an emotion of pity, which did not ari&s;e from the circum&s;tances $f their &s;lavery, but from the thraldom of their &s;ouls, which were under the do|minion of the devil. The good man was &s;o much melted by this con&s;ideration, that he re&s;olved to deliver the whole nation from the tyranny of Satan, and with that view he actually embarked in a &s;hip for Britain, when his pious inten|tion

was fru&s;trated by his popularity in Rome; for his de&s;$gn was no &s;ooner made public, than the citizens pre&s;ented a re$on&s;trance to pope Benedict, re|que&s;ting that Gregory might not be &s;uffered to ab&s;ent him&s;elf from his evange|lical functions in that city; and he was recalled accordingly.</P>

<P>He did not however lay a&s;ide his apo&s;tolical de&s;ign; for, when he &s;ucce$d$d Pelagius in the papal chair, he ordered a mo$k called Augu&s;tin, and others of the &s;ame brotherhood, to undertake the office of mi&s;&s;ionaries in Britain. They obeyed his hol$ne&s;s, though they had no great &s;tomach to the enterprize; but their terrors wa$$d &s;o &s;trong, before they had performed one half of the journey, that they &s;ent back A$gu&s;tin with a petition to the pope, begging they might be excu&s;ed from a mi&s;&s;ion that mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily expo&s;e their lives to the mo&s;t imminent danger from the prejudice and barbarity of &s;uch a ferocious nation. Neve$thele&s;s, Greg$ry would not be diverted from $$s purpo&s;e, by the importunities of tho&s;e poor terrified monks, to whom he di&s;patched Augu&s;tin with a letter to this effect:</P>

<P>IN order to make the reader acquainted with the genius of the Saxons, who $ettled in England, and who&s;e hi&s;tory begins as it were at this period, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to give a &s;uccinct acount of their civil and rellgious government, as well as of the particular cu&s;toms by which their character is di&s;tingui&s;hed and a&s;certained.</P>
<P>Their government was ari&s;tocratical; for, though the people were con&s;ulted in all affairs of very great con&s;equence, or fundamental points of con&s;titution, and their &s;entiments expre&s;&s;ed in a very tumultuary manner, the authority re|&s;ided in a few noblemen, who were no other than chieftains of di&s;tinct tribes, united for their mutual advantage. Of the&s;e a certain number was cho&s;en, to &s;u|perintend the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, and in time of war one of that number was elected general or king, but his power expired at the return of peace. We are not to look for a &s;ettled con&s;titution among the Saxons, who fir&s;t landed in Britain$ They were bold, illiterate adventurers, who enli$ted as volunteers with comman|ders of approved valour, under who&s;e conduct they hoped to gain an agreeable &s;ettlement, or reap a plentiful harve&s;t of plunder. Though they retained the manners and cu&s;toms of their own country, it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed they would adhere to the e&s;tabli&s;hed forms of government in a military expedition, during which they were obliged to contrive new regulations according to the emergency of their affairs, the character of their leaders, and the incon&s;tancy or caprice of their own di&s;po&s;ition. When they acquired &s;ettlements in Britain, they formed new &s;ocieties, and would have naturally adopted the con&s;titution of their own country, had not divers circum&s;tances concurred to &s;hew them the expediency of altering the &s;y&s;tem of government. Their leaders had gained an acce&s;&s;ion of power, in the co$r&s;e of their military command; and the &s;oldiers, inured to rapine and irregu|larities, could not be re&s;trained within proper bounds, by any civil in&s;titution weaker than that of regal authority. Nor without &s;uch a power to unite, con|troul, and command the petty chiefs as well as the commons, could the nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures have been taken for the pre&s;ervation of their colonies in a &s;trange country, &s;urrounded by implacable foes, who exerted their utmo&s;t vigilance, courage, and $$$ivity for their de&s;truction. The&s;e confiderations, reinforced by the mot$ves of private intere&s;t and ambition, induced the communities of the Saxon adventurers in England, to inve&s;t particular per&s;ons with the kingly pre|rogative, under &s;uch re&s;trictions, however, as formed a mutual compact, ren|dering the ties of allegiance and protection equally binding and reciprocal.</P>

<P>Be$ore this e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;overeign authority, the Saxons a&s;&s;embled upon certain days to deliberate upon public affairs; and they generally met in arms. The a&s;&s;embly being convened, &s;ilence was commanded by a prie&s;t, who &s;eems to have had great authority on &s;uch occa&s;ions: then, &s;ome per&s;on eminent for military virtue, quality or eloquence, &s;tood up and harangued the multitude on the &s;ubject of their meeting; and his &s;peech was either condemned by a tumultuous noi&s;e, or applauded by the clattering of their javelins. The

common bu&s;ine&s;s of the&s;e councils was to appoint chiefs for pre&s;iding in their &s;everal divi&s;ions, &s;hires, &s;treets, and villages; and each of the&s;e pre&s;idents was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by an hundred commoners by way of a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hence we derive our hundred courts in England; in which the centenarius or hundre|darius anciently pre&s;ided as judge, and all the be&s;t men of the county were his a$$e$$ors and jurors.

<P>Though tho&s;e con&s;ultations were held by the chiefs and people in com|mon, every individual was not admitted to the council, which con&s;i&s;ted of &s;uch only as wore armour, and no man was entitled to this privilege until he had, by the con&s;ent and determination of the council, been formally armed by $om$ relation or godfather with a &s;hield and lan$e; &s;o that this ceremony &s;eems to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tacit. de Mor.

<P>The Saxon hu&s;band, in&s;tead of receiving a portion, &s;ettled a dower upon his wife at marriage; and if &s;he proved fal&s;e to his bed, he was permitted by law, to cut off her hair, &s;trip her naked, turn her out of doo$s, in pre&s;ence of her re|lations, and f$ourge her through the public &s;treets.</P>
<P>The children &s;ucceeded to the inheritance of their fathers, without will: but after their &s;ettlement in Britain, they found it convenient to alter this in&s;titution; as all the property accruing from conque&s;t was per&s;onal acqui$$tion, and there|fore alienable. Hence their bocland or free tenure, grantable by deed, was deemed alienable by will; whereas all the &s;ons inherited alike the lands held by feofage.</P>

<P>They deemed it nece&s;&s;ary to maintain the animo&s;ities and fe$ds as well as the friend&s;hips of their fathers: the crime of murder was puni&s;hed by a fine of cattle, to be di&s;tributed among the family of the decea&s;ed$ and the proprietor of the land pre&s;cribed to the farmer the quantity of corn, cattle, $word$ cloth which he was to pay as rent; a cu&s;tom &s;till ob&s;erved in North Britain, where the pea&s;ants pay in kind.</P>

<P>With re&s;pect to religion, we find they had &s;uper&s;titions in com$on with other nations. Their divination was very $imple, with $$ips of w$$d c$t from a fruit-bearing tree, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by different marks or notches; the&s;e they mingled and jumbled $ogether in a white cloth; then the prieft, if it was a public ceremony, or the father of the family, if it was a private augury, implored the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of the Gods; and $aifing up his $yes towards heaven, took up a &s;lip three times &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and progno&s;ticated good or evil, according to the marks th$t chanced to ca&s;t up. They likewi&s;e divined future events, by the &s;inging and flight of birds, as well as from the neighing of hor&s;es, which they con&s;idered as the mini&s;ters of the Gods, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e of a white colour; and the&s;e were fed in woods and groves at the public expence. But, the circum&s;tance

<P>Their rel$gion bore a &s;trong affinity to that of other nations, with re&s;pect to the att$ibutes of their deities. Woden was wor&s;hipped as their Mer|cury, with human &s;acrifices, and to him was con&s;ecrated the fourth day of the week. They &s;eem to have paid their devotions to Venus under the denomina|tion of Fr$a, who pre&s;ided over the &s;ixth day; and Tue&s;day derived its name from Tuy&s;co, whom they cultivated as the founder of their nation. They likewi&s;e wor&s;hipped a godde&s;s, whom they termed Eo&s;ter, and to her they dedi|cated the month of April, during which the wind commonly blows from the Ea&s;t, con&s;equently favourable to them when they &s;et out on their marine ex|peditions. But their principal patrone&s;s was Hartha or Earth, who&s;e re&s;idence was in a vehicle covered with a &s;acred ve&s;tment, and placed in a con&s;ecrated grove, in a certain i&s;land of the ocean. This ark was &s;ometimes carried about by cows, and attended by a prie&s;t, who alone was permitted to touch the vehi|cle. While this godde&s;s continued in her progre&s;s and vi&s;itation, joy and fe&s;ti|vity filled every place &s;he honoured with her pre&s;ence; and at her return to the temple or grove, the vehicle and the ve&s;tments were purified in a &s;ecret lake <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Be&s;ides the&s;e, the Saxons wor&s;hipped the &s;$n and the moon, repre&s;ented by different idols. The god Thor was their principal deity that p$e&s;ided over the thunder. Seater or Crodo, $$o gave his name to Saturday, was another of their gods.

<P>With regard to the cu&s;toms and di&s;po&s;ition of the Saxons, they were extremely ho&s;pitable, addicted to exce&s;&s;ive drinking, and quarrel&s;ome in their cups; they were a blunt, hone&s;t people, without guile or much ingenuity, who loved to carou&s;e all night long at their malt liquor; upon which occa&s;ions they delivered their &s;entiments with &s;uch indelicate freedom, that the company &s;el|dom parted without blood&s;hed; yet, they were as open to reconciliation as prone to anger. They were &s;o infatuated in their attachment to games of chance, that a man, after having lo&s;t all his effects, very often played away his liberty, and allowed him&s;elf to be &s;old for a &s;lave.

<P>&sect; VIII. We have already &s;een that Augu&s;tin and &s;ome fellow-labourers were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by Gregory bi&s;hop of Rome, in order to convert tho&s;e ignorant and boi&s;terous Saxons, who had been &s;o much occupied in tumults of war and nece&s;&s;ary regulations touching their civil government, that hitherto they had found no time nor opportunity to con&s;ider the difference of religions, much le&s;s to be influenced, dazzled, and convinced by the truth and purity of the Chri&s;tian doctrine; for, the number of individuals, who had already embraced the faith, was but incon&s;iderable when compared to the bulk of the nation. As this was certainly the ca&s;e, Augu&s;tin would in all probabi$ity have found his mi&s;&s;ion very trouble&s;ome and hazardous, if he had not met with a powerful patrone&s;s in Bertha, con&s;ort of Ethelbert king of Kent, who had already made an impre&s;&s;ion on the mind of her h$&s;band, by her virtuous conduct, benevolence, and di&s;cretion, manife&s;ted in a cour&s;e of thirty years which they lived together. By the articles of her marriage, &s;he enjoyed the free exerci&s;e of her religion, and was attended by a venerable prelate called Luidhard, who officiated in a church dedicated to St. Martin, which had been built by the Romans near the walls of Canterbury. The exemplary conduct and powerful preaching of this pri|mitive bi&s;hop, co-operated with the queen's learning and zeal, in giving a fa|vourable idea of the Chri&s;tian religion to Ethelbert him&s;elf, as well as his courtiers, who by this time had even di&s;covered a de&s;ire of being converted; &s;o that the vineyard was well prepared when Augu&s;tin landed in the i&s;le of Thanet<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>The Britons encouraged by the inte&s;tine commotions of Cen|wal's kingdom, and the damage he had &s;u&s;tained from the arms of Penda, a&s;&s;embled an army and entered his dominions: Cenwal, advancing with his forces to oppo&s;e them, was attacked at a hill called Pene in Somer&s;et&s;hire, with &s;uch fury that his Saxons began to give ground; but di&s;daining the thoughts of being wor&s;ted by an enemy, whom they had &s;o often defeated, they re|collected all their courage and re&s;olution, and returning to the charge with re|doubled<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hunting.

<P>At her decea&s;e the nobles divided the kingdom among them|&s;elves, though it appears that this ari&s;tocracy was not of long duration; for, in the cour&s;e of the year that &s;ucceeded Saxburga's death, we find the kingdom po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by E&s;$ui$, de&s;cended from the famous Cerdic. This prince had n$$ &s;wayed the &s;ceptre of We&s;&s;ex two whole years, when he was engaged in a war<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> with Wulphur king of Mercia, who&s;e army he engaged at Bedanheafd, &s;uppo&s;ed to be Bedwin in Wilt&s;hire, where a bloody battle was fought with great &s;laugh|ter<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> on both &s;ides, though the advantage remained with the Mercian: but, he did not long enjoy the fruits of his victory, which preceded his death but a few months: and E&s;cuin died about two years after he a&s;cended the throne.</P>
<P>He was &s;ucceeded by Centwin &s;on of the late king Cinegils, who obtained &s;everal victories over the Britons, whom he repelled even to the we&s;tern &s;hore; and his &s;ucce&s;s obliged their king Cadwallader to go in per&s;on, and demand &s;uc|cours of the king of Armorica; that prince afterwards made a journey to Rome, where he died.</P>

<P>Towards the latter end of Centwin's reign, he conceived a jealou&s;y of his kin&s;man Ceadwalla, a prince of great hopes, who had won the affec|tions of the people, and acquired a popularity which Centwin thought dange|rous to his throne. He therefore ordered him to quit the kingdom; and he retired into Su&s;&s;ex with a numerous train of attendants in arms, &s;o as to give umbrage to Adelwalch &s;overeign of that country, who a&s;&s;embled a body of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch. 686</NOTE> troops to expel that adventurer, and (as we have already ob&s;erved) lo&s;t his life in t$e attempt.

<P>Whatever happine&s;s the conduct of his youth might have promi&s;ed to his &s;ubjects, certain it is he was &s;avage and cruel almo&s;t beyond example. After having terminated the war again&s;t Authun and Berthun, to his own ad|vantage, $e invaded and ravaged the country of Kent; and afterwards attacked the i&s;le of Wight, which had depended upon the kingdom of Su&s;&s;ex, ever &s;ince Wulphur had b$&s;towed it upon Adelwalch. Arwalt brother of Authun was at that time governor of the i&s;land, which he attempted to defend, but being overpowered by numbers, was obliged to retire and leave the inhabitants at the mercy of the victor, who behaved upon this occa&s;ion with &s;uch brutal barbarity as mu&s;t render his name infamous to all po&s;terity. Being apprehen&s;ive that the people of the i&s;le of Wight would take the fir&s;t opportunity of withdrawing their necks from his yoke, he re&s;olved to exterminate them on pretence of their being idolators; and actually executed this cruel ma&s;&s;acre upon all the inhabi|tants, except two hundred famil$es, which with their lands and effects he pre|$$nted to hi$ prime mini&s;ter Wilfred, bi&s;hop of Sel&s;ey, who accepted of the donation with a view to convert tho&s;e poor &s;ouls to Chri&s;tianity.

di&s;covered and put to death, after the abbot of Reodford, now Redbridge, had been permitted to make them pro&s;elytes to the chri&s;tian religion, of which Ceadwalla's conduct mu&s;t have certainly given them a very &s;ublime and favour|able idea. For, tho' he had not yet formally abjured pagani&s;m, he affected great devotion and zeal for the church, and even be&s;towed upon it a tythe of all the &s;poils and plunder he had made: a very effectual atonement, in con&s;ideration of which the clergy gave him ab&s;olution for all the villanies he could perpetrate.</P>

<P>Redwald, allured by the bribe, and intimidated by the menaces of &s;uch a formidable monarch, for &s;ome time wavered between his glory and convenience; but was at length determined by the &s;ugge&s;tions of his con&s;cience, reinforced with the mediation of his queen, in favour of the young prince, to whom he

<P>The victorious Redwald marched directly into Northumberland, where<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 617. Hen.

Far from u&s;ing the rights of a conqueror to their prejudice, he generou&s;ly e&s;tabli&s;hed Edwin in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of both kingdoms, though his claim had been limited to Deira alone, and con|tented him&s;elf with the glory of &s;uch a generous expedition.</P>

<P>After the death of Redwald, who had been rai&s;ed to the &s;upreme power over all the kings of the heptarchy, Edwin, who always re&s;pec$$$ him as a benefactor, openly declared his de&s;ign of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing that dignity; and no prince di&s;puted his preten&s;ions but Quinchelm, king of We&s;&s;ex, who by this oppo&s;ition brought upon him&s;elf a war which endangered his dominions, and
<PB N="104" REF="1130">
compelled him at la&s;t to &s;ue for peace. This contention being terminated by the treaty, he was ve&s;ted with the &s;overeign command; and the Britons, whom he threatened to invade, con&s;ented to pay a tribute, rather than incur the effects of his indignation.</P>
<P>Thus aggrandized by a chain of &s;ucce&s;sful events, part of which he owed to fortune, and part to his own &s;uperior talents, he began to extend the authority with which he had been lately inve&s;ted, and pretended to ex|ert an ab&s;olute dominion over all the other kings of the heptarchy. He had formerly been married to a &s;i&s;ter of the Mercian king; but &s;he dying, he now re&s;olved to e&s;pou&s;e Ethelburga, &s;i&s;ter to Eadbald king of Kent, a prince&s;s of great merit, who would have doubtle&s;s rejected any match, how&s;oever advantageous, with a pagan, had not &s;he been animated with the zeal of converting him and his &s;ubjects to the chri&s;tian religion. Before &s;he would give her con$ent, how|ever, it was &s;olemnly &s;tipulated that &s;he &s;hould have the free exerci&s;e of her own wor&s;hip, and be attended by bi&s;hop Paul$nus, who propagated the go&s;pel among the Northumbrian infidels, and was in&s;trumental in the conver&s;ion of Edwin him&s;elf. After he had defeated Quinchelm, and ravaged the country of We&s;&s;ex with great &s;everity, he returned to his own kingdom, and began to di&s;cover &s;igns of unea&s;ine&s;s touching the religion he profe&s;&s;ed: the queen, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Paulinus, had not failed to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s his mind in favour of chri&s;tianity; but, he &s;till re|tained &s;cruples which they had not been able to remove, and this uncertainty produced di&s;quiet and perturbation. While he thus he&s;itated between the true faith and idolatry, his determination was influenced by the conduct of his prime mini&s;ter Coi&s;i, who was at the &s;ame time chief prie&s;t of his ancient religion. This pontif, being a man of moderation and good under&s;tanding, joined the queen and Paulinus, declared in favour of Chri&s;tianity, and with his own hands de|moli&s;hed the idols which he had formerly adored. Such a remarkable in&s;tance of conviction had a wonderful effect upon the king, who was &s;oon after bap|tized, with al$ his court, at York, of which he created Paulinus bi&s;hop.</P>

<DIV4 N="7" TYPE="section">

<P>His new religion did not &s;eem to teach him humility; for, he grew every day more and more ab&s;olute and imperious, and on &s;olemn occa&s;ions or|dered a globe to be carried before him, to denote the union of the heptarchy un|der his &s;overeign command. His ambition and in&s;olence of power excited the jealou&s;y and re&s;entment of all the Anglo-Saxon princes; and in particular in|flamed the indignation of Penda the Mercian king, who was naturally fierce and impatient, and longed pa&s;&s;ionately for an occa&s;ion to &s;hake off the dominion of the Northumbrian monarch. Nor did he long wait for an opportunity: Cead|walla king of the Britons, whom he had di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and &s;addled with a tribute, conferred with Penda upon their mutual di&s;grace in &s;ubmitting to the &s;way of a prince, who was in no re&s;pect their &s;uperior; and finding their &s;entiments agree upon the &s;ubject, re&s;olved to di&s;pute his preheminence. With this view they immediately joined their forces, and advanced as far as Hatfield, in the we&s;t-riding of York&s;hire, where they found Edwin ready to give them battle. The engagement began with de&s;perate fury on both &s;ides; and though the con|federat$s had greatly the advantage in number, they in all probability would have yielded at la&s;t to the capacity of Edwin and the di&s;cipline of his troops, had not an accident deprived him of that cool deliberation and pre&s;ence of mind, which he had hitherto pre&s;erved. His &s;on Offrid fell at his feet transfixed with
<PB N="105" REF="1140">
an arrow; and this &s;pectacle filled his brea&s;t with tumults of rage and di&s;traction. Without regarding the po&s;ture of his men, or the di&s;po&s;ition of the battle, he ru&s;hed<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 633.</NOTE> &s;ingly into the thicke&s;t body of the enemy; and his retreat being cut off, was immediately di&s;patched by a multitude of weapons. When their king di&s;appeared, the Northumbrians were &s;eized with con&s;ternation, and abandoned the field of battle, leaving a compleat victory to the allies, which they pro&s;ecuted with the utmo&s;t inhumanity. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bede, l. ii.</NOTE></P>

Effrid the &s;on of Edwin dreading the &s;anguinary di&s;po&s;ition of this brutal mon|&s;ter, &s;urrendered him&s;elf to the king of Mercia, who received him at fir&s;t with &s;ome decree of humanity, and afterwards ordered him to be butchered in his pre|&s;ence: As for queen Ethelburga, &s;he fled with Paulinus to her brother the Kenti&s;h<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thorn.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bede, l. iii.</NOTE> By this great victory, O&s;wald was put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the two Northum|brian kingdoms, to both which he was heir by his father Ethelfrid, and his mo|ther Acca, who was Edwin's &s;i&s;ter. He began his reign with the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of excellent regulations; &s;o that the people &s;oon forgot the calamities they had undergone. Being a prince of natural capacity, cultivated with pro|per education, he took effectual mea&s;ures for &s;oftening and poli&s;hing the manners of his rude Northumbrians; and lo&s;t no opportunity of propagating Chri&s;tianity, and promoting the intere&s;ts of the church. His learning was ex|ten&s;ive, and his charity unlimited; in&s;omuch that it was his con&s;tant practice to &s;end food to the poor from his own table; and he frequently ordered the &s;ilver di&s;hes that contained it to be broken and divided among the nece&s;&s;itous. Such virtue could not fail to win the affections of his people: the clergy revered him as a &s;aint, and the other Saxon princes rai&s;ed him to the &s;upreme command of their confederacy. The tranquillity and happine&s;s of his reign was interrupt|ed by the unquiet &s;pirit of Penda the Mercian king, who, impatient of O&s;wald's character and &s;uperior &s;tation, re&s;olved to de&s;troy that prince, as the great ob&s;ta|cle to his ambitious de&s;igns. He therefore &s;uddenly a&s;&s;embled his forces, and began his march for Northumberland, where he hoped to find his rival unpre|pared. This was really the ca&s;e with O&s;wald, who neverthele&s;s advanced again&s;t him with the &s;mall number of troops that were at hand, and lo&s;t his life in the battle that en&s;ued, at a place which thence took the name of O&s;|we&s;tre.</P>
<P>The victor u&s;ed his good fortune with all that in&s;olence and barbarity which<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

O&s;win, who was a prince of mean parts and great devotion, endea|voured by divers pacific propo&s;als to divert O&s;wy from his purpo&s;e; and the&s;e $roving ineffectual, he was obliged at la&s;t to have recour&s;e to arms: but, before the armies came in &s;ight of each other, he was &s;o &s;hocked at the pro&s;pect of &s;hedding chri&s;tian blood, that he re&s;olved to retire into a convent, and in the mean time withdrawing privately from his troops, he repaired to the hou&s;e of a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bed$, l. iii.</NOTE> count, whom he believed a faithful adherent; and that traitor betrayed him to O&s;wy, who cruelly deprived him of his life.

<P>The oppo&s;ite armies met on the banks of the Aar, in York&s;hire; but by that time Athelwalt reflecting that he &s;hould, in all probability, become a prey to the conqueror, whether victory &s;hould declare for Penda or for O&s;wy, he re&s;olved to &s;tand neuter during the engagement, that he might be in a con|dition to defend him&s;elf from the de&s;igns of the victor. Penda and the Ea&s;t Anglian king, without &s;u&s;pecting his intention, attacked the Bernicians with great fury: but their forces perceiving Athelwalt wheeling off with his Nor|thumbrians, concluded them&s;elves betrayed, and giving ground immediately, their two chiefs were &s;lain in endeavouring to rally and bring them back to the charge. Immediately after this battle, which was fought at a place called Win|field, O&s;wy penetrated into Mercia, which he &s;ubdued without oppo&s;ition, the &s;ons of Penda being obliged to fly for refuge into another kingdom: this con|que&s;t he enjoyed about three years, during which he was elected chief of the Saxon confederacy, &s;tation which had remained unfilled &s;ince the death of his brother O&s;wald; but, at length his officers exerci&s;ed &s;uch &s;everities in Mercia, that the natives took to their arms, and driving the Northumbrians out of the kingdom, placed Wolpher, the &s;on of Penda, upon the throne.</P>

<P>After his defeat and death, O&s;wy the conqueror made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the kingdom of Mercia, which he kept three years, permitting, however, his &s;on-in-law Peada to enjoy the little kingdom of Leice&s;ter, which his father had erected into a &s;overeignty; but, this unhappy prince being afterwards poi|&s;oned by his own wife, her father O&s;wy took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his principality, and retained it in his hands, together with the re&s;t of the Mercian kingdom, until it was wre&s;ted from him by the gallantry of Wolpher. The reign of this king was almo&s;t as tempe&s;tuous as that of his father; for, he was continually at war with his neighbours, though his enterprizes did not always &s;ucceed.

This was one of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious princes who reigned in Mercia, and was cho&s;en chief of the Saxon confederacy, after Ina king of We&s;&s;ex had ab|dicated his crown.

<P>The archbi&s;hops of Canterbury not only endeavoured to extend their juri&s;diction over the Briti&s;h church, but al&s;o to reduce the Scotti&s;h clergy to the dominion of the pope. Theodore, a Greek, having been promoted to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

This was a &s;troke aimed at the Britons and Scots, who celebrated that fe&s;tival by another rule, and two bi&s;hops from Icolm|kill had prevailed upon the Northumbrians to adopt their u&s;age in this re&s;pect, though they had been converted by Roman mi&s;&s;ionaries.

<P>Lutherius, bi&s;hop of the We&s;t Saxons, dying about this period, his place was filled with Heddi, con&s;ecrated by Theodore, who exerted his au|thority even to the depo&s;ition of bi&s;hops, in the ca&s;e of Winfred bi&s;hop of the Mer|cians, whom he removed from his &s;ee, appointing Sexwulf as his &s;ucce&s;&s;or.

<P>Her inflexible ob&s;tinacy cured him of his pa&s;&s;ion, and he married Ermenburga, a prince&s;s of a very different complexion, who confirmed the king in his re&s;entment again&s;t Wilfred, whom he was re&s;olved to humble for his arrogance and pre&s;umption: but the power and intere&s;t of this prelate was &s;o great, that he would not venture to attack him openly, until he had effected a rupture between Wilfred and Theodore, who at Egfrid's reque&s;t, erected &s;everal new bi&s;hoprics in the dioce&s;e of York, without the con&s;ent of the bi&s;hop. Wil|fred, enraged at this innovation, exclaimed bitterly again&s;t the metropolitan and the king, and demanded the revenues which had been converted to the mainte|nance of the new prelates. The king in&s;i&s;ted upon the rectitude and legality of the &s;teps he had taken, and Wilfred appealed to the deci&s;ion of Rome, whi|ther he went in per&s;on, and pre&s;ented a &s;ervile petition to the pope and council a&s;&s;embled for the purpo&s;e. In return for the gro&s;s incen&s;e he offered to Pope Ag$tho, he obtained a decree for being rein&s;tated in his bi&s;hopric, on pain of excommunication to all tho&s;e who &s;hould oppo&s;e his re&s;toration. Wilfred im|mediately returned to England, in full confidence of recovering all that he had lo&s;t. When he delivered his credentials to Egfrid, that prince &s;ummoned a general council of the clergy and laity, who a&s;&s;erted their independence of Rome; and Egfrid, finding him&s;elf &s;upported by the opinion of his &s;ubjects, &s;ent Wilfred to pri&s;on, where he lay a whole year, until his relea&s;e was obtained by the in|terce&s;&s;ion of the abbe&s;s Ebba, a lady of the royal family. But, this favour being granted on condition that he &s;hould immediately quit the kingdom, he re|tired to Mercia, from whence he was driven by king Ethelred, who dreaded the di&s;plea&s;ure of the Northumbrian monarch. He was al&s;o obliged to leave the country of the We&s;t Saxons; and then took up his habitation among the South Saxons, where, as we have formerly ob&s;erved, he acquired great influence and power.</P>
<P>Perhaps it was in con&s;equence of his &s;ucce&s;s, that Theodore invited him to a conference, in which all differences were compromi&s;ed, and the archbi&s;hop of<NOTE PLACE="marg">$ede. H$$$.

<P>Tho' now turned of &s;eventy, he made another journey to Rome, where he was again acquitted in full &s;ynod, and furni&s;hed with letters of recom|mendation to the kings of Mercia and Northumberland.

After the death of this prince, he endeavoured to introduce him&s;elf under the reign of Eadwulf, who rejected his propo&s;als and expelled him from his dominions.

<P>The archbi&s;hop of Canterbury thinking it was now high time to accommodate matters with a prie&s;t of &s;uch intere&s;t and a&s;piring ambition, con|voked a council near the river Nid, now in Scotland; and there it was decreed that John bi&s;hop of Hexham &s;hould be tran&s;lated to the &s;ee of York, vacant by<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bede, l. ii.</NOTE> the death of Bo&s;a; and that Wilfred &s;hould not only &s;ucceed to the bi&s;hopric of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>In the cour&s;e of the &s;ame year there was a &s;ynod at Alne, convoked at the in&s;tance of Egwin bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, who by a grant from the pope had built a mona&s;tery at Eve&s;ham, the privileges of which we$e con$$$$ed by this council. This is the prelate who is &s;aid to have been the occasion of introducing image-wor&s;hip into England, by a vi&s;ion of the virgin Ma|ry, who commanded him to &s;et up her image in his cathedral. But, the charters brought in &s;upport of this a&s;&s;ertion, have been clearly convicted<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>DEPLORABLE was the &s;ituation of the kingdom, when this great prince a&s;cended the throne. The Danes had already &s;ubdued Northum|berland and Ea&s;t Anglia, and gained footing in the very heart of We&s;&s;ex; all the churches and monasteries were burnt, and the whole face of the country de|&s;olated. In the very fir&s;t month of his reign he was obliged to march again&s;t this terrible enemy, who had advanced to Chilton, where a de&s;perate battle was<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$$er.</NOTE> fought to the di&s;advantage of the Engli&s;h: yet the defeat was not &s;o great as to deprive Alfred of all re&s;ource; that indefatigable prince took &s;uch mea&s;ures for repairing the damage he had &s;u&s;tained, that he was in a very little time enabled to hazard another engagement; and the Danes, who had been very roughly handled in the la&s;t battle, dreading his invincible courage and activity, pro|po&s;ed terms of peace, which he did not think proper to refu&s;e. In con&s;equence of this treaty, they evacuated his dominions, and retired to the north, in order to &s;ubdue Mercia and &s;ettle their conque&s;ts in Northumberland.</P>

<P>The happine&s;s and peace which the people of England enjoyed under the parental &s;way of this excellent prince, having la&s;ted twelve years without interrup|tion, was at length invaded by new alarms. The Danes, under Ha&s;tings, having &s;u&s;tained two terrible checks from Eudes, and Arnold, kings of France and Ger|many, re&s;olved to try their fortune once more in England, not with a view to make a &s;ettlement, but in hope of enriching them&s;elves with plunder; for this purpo&s;e, they equipped three hundred ve&s;&s;els, which they divided into two fleets, and one of the&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting of two hundred fail, bent its cour&s;e towards Kent, where the adventurers landing, &s;urpri&s;ed Appledore. The other entered the river Thames, under the command of Ha&s;tings, who made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Milton, and he and his colleague &s;eemed to vye with each other in acts of rapine and barbarity. Alfred was at that time in Ea&s;t Anglia, &s;ettling the affairs of the kingdom upon the death of Guthrun: and he no &s;ooner received intelligence of the inva&s;ion, than he exacted a new oath of allegiance from his Ea&s;t An|glian &s;ubjects, Danes as well as Engli&s;h.</P>

Alfred in the mean time a&s;&s;embled his troops, and advanced again&s;t that body of the invaders who ravaged the county of Kent; but, being informed in his march, that another &s;warm had lighted upon We&s;&s;ex, he changed his route, in order to face tho&s;e who had pe|netrated into the heart of his own country. They had already inve&s;ted Exeter, but being apprized of his approach, they rai&s;ed the &s;iege with precipitation, and retired to their &s;hips.

<P>Towards the latter end of the year, they advanced to the borders of Mercia, and erected two forts at Hertford on the Ley, for the &s;ecurity of their &s;hips which they had brought up that river.

But Alfred, approaching with his army, and viewing the nature of their &s;ituation, turned the cour&s;e of the &s;tream; &s;o that their ve&s;&s;els were left on dry ground: a circum&s;tance which terrified them to &s;uch a degree, that they abandoned their forts, and flying towards the Severne, were pur&s;ued by Alfred as far as Quatbridge, where they intrenched them&s;elves for the pre&s;ent, until they found an opportunity of retiring into Northumber|land, where their friends &s;upplied them with &s;hips, in which they imbarked for Normandy in a mi&s;erable plight, after having remained in England three years, during which they had undergone a &s;eries of mi&s;ery and mi&s;chance, harra&s;&s;ed, hunted, and dimini&s;hed one half in their number, by di&s;ea&s;es, famine, and the &s;word.

<P>Having once more re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the peace of the country by the ex|pul&s;ion of tho&s;e invaders, he re&s;umed the character of the legi&s;lator, in order to fi|ni&s;h the plan of government in the execution of which he had already made &s;uch confiderable progre&s;s. He divided the whole kingdom into counties, the counties into hundreds, and the&s;e la&s;t into tythings, &s;o denominated becau&s;e they con&s;i&s;ted of ten freeholders, who were pledges to the king for the good behaviour of each other. He complied an excellent body of laws from the &s;cripture, the in|&s;titutions of other nations, and the collections or dige&s;ta of his predece&s;&s;ors Ethelbert, Ina, and Offa. He was author of that ine&s;timable privilege peculiar to the &s;ubjects of this nation, which con&s;i&s;ts in their being tried by their peers; for he fir&s;t in&s;tituted juries, or at lea&s;t improved upon an old in&s;titution, by &s;pe|cifying the number and qualifications of the jurymen, and extending their power to trials of property as well as criminal indictments. He invented the expedient of giving bail and &s;urety, in order to exempt individuals from unmerited impri|&s;onment; he appointed public fairs and markets, to prevent the clande&s;tine &s;ale of &s;tolen cattle; he aboli&s;hed the civil juri&s;diction of thanes or coldermen, who acted in the double capacity of generals and judges, in their re&s;pective &s;hires, and &s;ub&s;tituted in their room &s;hire-reeves, who acted as deputies to the&s;e counts or eoldermen. Ju&s;tices were like likewi&s;e appointed; but the original extent of their power is not exactly known. And la&s;tly, he ordained that original writs &s;hould be granted by the proper officer, without any &s;pecial petition to the king; by which form, the plaintiff was provided with the immediate means of pro&s;ecu|tion and redre&s;s.</P>

<P>But, no regulation of Alfred redounded more to his honour and the advantage of the kingdom, than the mea&s;ures he took to prevent rapine, murder, and other outrages, which had &s;o long been committed with impunity. Every tything-man was bound for the good behaviour of his own family, his neighbours, and gue&s;ts; and obliged, in ca&s;e of any breach of the peace, or other crime, to have the offender forthcoming, or if he fled, to purge him&s;elf of all &s;u&s;picion of being an accomplice.

<P>Occupied as he was in this great work of laying the foundation of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, his attention &s;tooped even to the minute&s;t circum|&s;tance of his people's conveniency. He introduced the art of brick-mak|ing, and built his own hou&s;es of tho&s;e materials, which being much more durable, &s;ightly, and &s;ecure from accidents, than timber, his example was followed, fir&s;t, by his nobles, and afterwards by the &s;ubjects in general, who vyed with each other in expre&s;&s;ing their reverence and affection for this illu&s;tri|ous monarch. He was, doubtle&s;s, an object of the mo&s;t perfect e&s;teem and ad|miration; for exclu&s;ive of the qualities which di&s;tingui&s;hed him as a warrior and legi&s;lator, his per&s;onal character was amiable in every re&s;pect. He had made con&s;iderable progre&s;s in the different &s;tudies of grammar, rhetoric, philo&s;o|phy, architecture, andgeometry, was an excellent hi&s;torian, and acknowledged to be the be&s;t Saxon poet of the age <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">He him&s;elf tran&s;lated the Pa&s;toral of Gre|gory I; Boetius de con&s;olatione; and Bede's eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory.

<P>And what rendered his erudition the more valuable and &s;urpri&s;ing, was the gro&s;s ignorance of the times, concerning which he him&s;elf complained, that from the Humber to the Thames, there was not one prie&s;t who perfectly under&s;tood the divine &s;ervice; nor one to be found between the Thames and the &s;ea, capable of tran&s;lating the ea&s;ie&s;t latin book.</P>

<P>Having re peopled Bedford with Engli&s;h, and fortified Maldon, he granted free liberty to all the Danes to depart from the kingdom, if they did not choo&s;e to live under his admini&s;tration; and Thurkytel, with all his adherents, took the advantage of this indulgence; a retreat which greatly &s;trengthened the admini&s;tration of Edward, who likewi&s;e owed great acce&s;&s;ion of power to the death of his &s;i&s;ter. That celebrated heroine had left one daughter, called Elf|winna, heire&s;s to the whole county of Mercia, the property of which had been ve&s;ted in her father by Alfred the great: and as this alienation from the crown was very prejudicial to her uncle Edward, &s;he began to fear he would take the fir&s;t opportunity of re-annexing it to his domains. In this apprehen&s;ion &s;he re|&s;olved to &s;trengthen her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by a match with Reginald, chief king of the Danes in England, and actually engaged in a &s;ecret treaty for that purpo&s;e: but her uncle being appri&s;ed of her intention &s;o detrimental to his intere&s;t, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the principal cities of Mercia, exacted an oath of allegiance from the inhabitants, and carried the young lady into his own dominions.

<P>He was &s;ucceeded in his throne by his elde&s;t &s;on Athel&s;tan, a prince every way qualified for wielding the &s;ceptre of a great empire: he had been
<PB N="153" REF="1620">
knighted by his grandfather<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Brompton tells us, that Athel&s;tan was the &s;on of a concubine c$lled Egwina, the daugh|ter of a &s;hepherd, who having in her infancy dreamed that the moon &s;hone out of her belly &s;o as to illuminate all England, was educated in a genteel manner at the expence of a matron who had given &s;uck to Edward. The young maiden became remarkable for her beauty and other accompli&s;hments; and one day, when the king vi&s;ited his nur&s;e, he chanced to ca&s;t his eyes upon Egwin$, and was &s;o captivated by her charms, that he would not leave the hou&s;e until he had obtained her con&s;ent to gratify his pa&s;&s;ion. Athel&s;tan wa$ the fruit of this amour, as well as a &s;econd &s;on called Alfred, and a daughter named Editha. Though this &s;tory is credited by William of Maime&s;bury and others, it is more likely that Egwina, though of humble parentage, was really the wife of Edward; for|a&s;much as we find Alfred the great honouring Athel&s;tan with the order of knighthood, as his own pre&s;umptive heir; which &s;urely would not have been the ca&s;e had he been a ba&s;tard. Be that as it will, Edward had two other wives, namely, Elfleda, daughter of earl El&s;helm, by whom he had Ethelwald, who died immediate|ly before his father, and Edwin; and Edgiva, by whom he had Edmund and Edred, who af|terwards reigned, and two daughters, the eld|e&s;t of whom was a nun, and the other married to Lewis, prince of Guienne. His &s;econd wife, be&s;ides the &s;ons we have mentioned, bore to him &s;ix daughters, two of whom lived in celi|bacy, and the other four were married to Charles the Simple, Hugh Capet, kings of France, the emperor Otho, and a duke, who&s;e territories lay near the Alps. <BIBL>Hi&s;t. major.

<P>His election, however, gave umbrage to a few noblemen, who per|haps had &s;ome &s;cruples about his legitimacy; and they engaged in a con&s;piracy to remove him from the throne, in favour of his brother Edwin.

<P>This di&s;turbance was no &s;ooner quelled, than commotions aro&s;e in another quarter.

Sithric &s;urvived his nuptials but a few months; and his elde&s;t &s;on Guthred, di&s;daining to hold a precarious &s;ceptre de|pendent upon the will of Athel&s;tan, &s;eized almo&s;t all the forts of the kingdom, and prohibited his &s;ubjects from paying the tribute to the Engli&s;h monarch.</P>

<P>Athel&s;tan, alarmed at this rebellion, a&s;&s;embled his troops, and en|tered Northumberland &s;o &s;uddenly, that Guthred with his brother Anlaf, and Inguald, king of York, had &s;carcely time to &s;ecure their per&s;ons by a precipi|tate flight; &s;o that the Engli&s;h king made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the whole country without oppo&s;ition, except the ca&s;tle of York, which he could not immediately reduce. He did not however enjoy his conque&s;t in tranquillity, while he had rea&s;on to believe the three fugitive princes had any chance of returning to excite fre&s;h troubles in Northumberland. The fate of Inguald is not known; but Anlaf e&s;caped into Ireland, and Guthred fled for protection to Con&s;tan|tine, king of Scotland. Athel&s;tan immediately &s;ent deputies to this prince, de&s;iring he would deliver the per&s;on of Guthred into his hands; otherwi&s;e he would go in que&s;t of him at the head of an army. Con&s;tantine, piqued at this in&s;olent me&s;&s;age, yet afraid of incurring the di&s;plea&s;ure of &s;uch a war|like monarch, agreed to meet Athel&s;tan at Daker, for which place he accord|ingly &s;et out, accompanied by Owen, king of Cumberland; but, in the mean time, gave Guthred an opportunity to withdraw from his court.</P>
<P>Athel&s;tan admitted the excu&s;es of the Scotti&s;h king, though not a little con|cerned at the e&s;cape of the Dane, who made an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt upon the city of York, and then turned pyrate on the high &s;eas, till at length being weary of &s;uch a boi&s;terous and infamou&s;ly precarious life, he &s;urrendered him&s;elf to the Engli&s;h king, who allowed him a pen&s;ion for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. This he enjoy|ed for &s;ome time; but at la&s;t conceiving &s;ome di&s;gu&s;t, he made his e&s;cape from the place of his re&s;idence, and was never heard of afterwards. Athel&s;tan, at this conference with the two kings, is &s;aid to have exacted homage from the both; and notwith&s;tanding all the allegations of the Scotti&s;h writers, who &s;o vehement|ly deny this act of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, in all probability it was impo&s;ed upon Con&s;tantine, who &s;eems to have retained an implacable re&s;entment again&s;t the Engli&s;h mo|narch from this period.

<P>Con&s;tantine returned to his own country, very much chagrined at the behaviour of Athel&s;tan; while Anlaf, informed of his di&s;content, repaired to his court from Ireland, and artfully inflamed his re&s;entment and ambition, by inveighing again&s;t the in&s;olence and dangerous power of the Engli&s;h king, and repre&s;enting the practicability of conquering Northumberland, by means of the &s;uccours he &s;hould be able to bring from Ireland. The Scotti&s;h prince ea|gerly embraced his propo&s;al, for the execution of which they began to make pre|parations without delay; and in the mean time, prevailed upon Howel king of Wales to make a diver&s;ion in their favour. Athel&s;tan, who had returned to We&s;&s;ex, broke their mea&s;ures by his diligence and activity; for &s;o &s;oon as he

<P>This war being happily terminated, he advanced into Scotland, in order to take vengeance upon Con&s;tantine, for having &s;ent a body of aux|iliaries to Howel. As Anlaf had not yet arrived with his reinforcement from Ireland, the Scotti&s;h king was in no condition to oppo&s;e the Engli&s;h army, which drove him from one end of the kingdom to the other; and at la&s;t compelled him to deprecate the wrath of Athel&s;tan with great humility. He obtained his reque&s;t from the Engli&s;h monarch, who at the &s;ame time re&s;tored all the places he had taken in that kingdom, hoping, by this act of genero&s;ity, to conciliate the affection of Con&s;tantine, and detach him from the intere&s;t of the Danes. But, all this indulgence &s;eemed rather to inflame than mitigate the rancour of Con|&s;tantine, who became more and more impatient to revenge this mortification, which his pride &s;u&s;tained from the triumph of Athel&s;tan's genero&s;ity: that prince was no &s;ooner returned to his own dominions, than he renewed his deli|berations with Anlaf; and the&s;e confederates exerted all their indu&s;try and power<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>Mean while, Athel&s;tan began to be di&s;quieted by jealous thoughts, ari&s;ing from the popularity of his brother Edwin, who was accu&s;ed by a certain nobleman of having been concerned in the con&s;piracy of Alfred. This charge had the greater appearance of truth, as Alfred's rebellion had been rai&s;ed on pre|tence of &s;etting Edwin upon the throne; and in all probability, Athel&s;tan was not very &s;orry to find a pretext for de&s;troying &s;uch a dangerous competitor in the affection of the public. Tho' the unhappy youth prote&s;ted, with all the appear|ance of truth and candour, that he was entirely innocent of the crime laid to his charge, he was convicted on the te&s;timony of this corrupted evidence; and Athel|&s;tan, being afraid of taking away his life by a public execution, ordered this unfor|tunate young prince to be turned adrift with one &s;ervant, in a crazy ve&s;&s;el de&s;titute of &s;ails, oars, and provi&s;ion. Edwin finding him&s;elf thus expo&s;ed to the dangers of the deep and horrors of famine, leaped overboard into the &s;ea, in which all his mi&s;ery was extingui&s;hed with his life, while his attendant re&s;olved to depend upon providence, and &s;aw him&s;elf with his boat ca&s;t a&s;hore by the billows on the coa&s;t of France. This cruel &s;entence was no &s;ooner executed than the king repented of what he had done: his jealous fears being now removed, he re|viewed the character of Edwin in the light of an amiable brother, and dete&s;ted the wretch on who&s;e evidence that young prince had been expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t terrible death. This perfidious nobleman one day &s;tumbled in pre&s;enting the cup to Athel&s;tan, but recovering a firm footing, by means of his other leg, "See (&s;aid he) how one brother a&s;&s;i&s;ts another." This remark was con&s;trued into raillery or reproach by Athel&s;tan, who forthwith ordered him to be put to death, as a &s;acrifice to the manes of Edwin; and endeavoured to expiate his own guilt by &s;evere penance and benefactions to the church <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">He did &s;even years penance, and built the mona&s;teries of Middleton and Michelne&s;s, in the county of Dor&s;et, ordering continual ma&s;&s;es to be &s;aid for his own pardon, and the repo&s;e of his brother's &s;oul.</NOTE>. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Id. ib$d.</NOTE></P>

They had directed their route to the northward, in order to conquer Bernicia for the Scotti&s;h king; but under&s;tanding that Athel&s;tan was on his march to attack them; they re&s;olved to &s;pare him part of the trouble, by meeting him on the way, and the two armies came in &s;ight of each other at a place called Bruneford. A battle, however, did not immediately en&s;ue, be|cau&s;e both armies were &s;o formidable and &s;o advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted, that neither cho&s;e to hazard an attack, until the inattention or mi&s;conduct of either &s;ide &s;hould afford an opportunity. During this pau&s;e Anlaf is &s;aid to have entered the Engli&s;h camp as a mu&s;ician, and played &s;o ravi&s;hingly as to attract the notice of Athel&s;tan, who ordered him to perform in the royal tent, and rewarded him with a liberal pre&s;ent. In his retreat he was known by a common &s;oldier, who allowed him to pa&s;s, and then informed the king of the di&s;covery he had made. Athel&s;tan chid him for allowing him to retire, but applauded the man's fidelity, when he told him he had once taken the oath of allegiance to that prince, and therefore would never be concerned in any particular attempt again&s;t his per&s;on. The king &s;hifted his quarters that very day, and the &s;ame &s;pot of ground was occupied by a bi&s;hop newly come to the camp, who lo&s;t his life in con&s;equence of choo&s;ing that &s;ituation; for, in the middle of the night, Anlaf at the head of a cho&s;en band, attacked the Engli&s;h encampment, and penetrating to this place, &s;lew the prelate and all his attendants, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the king &s;till re&s;ided in that quarter. Athel&s;tan, who&s;e tent was removed at the di&s;tance of a mile from this &s;cene of blood, taking the alarm, drew up his forces in order of bat|tle, and at day-break the two armies were fairly engaged. They fought all<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ingulph.</NOTE> day with equal bravery on both &s;ides; 'till at length the chancellor Turketul, at the head of a &s;elect band of Londoners, bore down all before him, and unhor&s;ed<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

After he had &s;ettled the affairs<NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

<P>Athel&s;tan was not more formidable in war, than con&s;ummate in the arts of policy and peace. He added new laws to tho&s;e which had been pub|li&s;hed by his grandfather Alfred; took the mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures for &s;ecuring the tranquillity of his country, both by fortifying it again&s;t the attempts of fo|reign enemies, and preventing dome&s;tic di&s;turbances, by a gentle &s;way and equal admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. He employed learned men to fini&s;h a tran&s;la|tion<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 941:</NOTE> of the Bible into the Saxon language; and notwith&s;tanding his piety and beneficence to the church, it appears from &s;ome fragments of his laws &s;till ex|tant, that his intention was to reduce the clergy, as well as the r$&s;t of his &s;ubjects under his dominion, by aboli&s;hing tho&s;e exemptions and &s;anctuaries which &s;erved only to encrea&s;e their in&s;olence, and enable them to protect the wor&s;t of criminals. That he was highly re&s;pected by foreign powers, appears from the great matches he procured for his &s;i&s;ters, one of whom, the widow of Charles the Simple, found a happy retreat in his dominions with her &s;on, who was afterwards di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Outre Mer or Ultra Marine, from his having been educated at the Engli&s;h court.</P>
<P>Athel&s;tan, after the reduction of the Scots, Danes, and Britons, and the re|treat of Anlaf, who returned to Ireland, enjoyed &s;ome years of re&s;pite from the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>Although the Danes were &s;ubdued, they were not yet reconciled to the Engli&s;h yoke, from which they re&s;olved to free them&s;elves with the fir&s;t con|venient opportunity. They con&s;idered the acce&s;&s;ion of young Edmund as a favourable conjuncture, and Anlaf did not fail to improve this di&s;po&s;ition, with a view to acquire the crown of Northumberland: but, con&s;cious of the impor|tance of &s;uch an enterprize to be undertaken again&s;t the whole power of Eng|land, he had recour&s;e to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Olaus, king of Norway, who &s;up|plied him with &s;hips and men, with which he invaded Northumberland, and was admitted into York, by means of a corre&s;pondence which $e had carried on with the principal inhabitants. The example of the capital was followed by a great many other places; the Engli&s;h garri&s;ons were expelled or ma&s;&s;acred, and the whole country received him as its &s;overeign. Not contented with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Northumberland, he advanced into Mercia, where his reception was alike favourable, and his countrymen in that kingdom a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in re-taking&s;ome places which had been wre&s;ted from them by Edward.</P>

From this ce&s;&s;ion one would be apt to imagine that Edmund had been wor&s;ted in the battle; and that he con|&s;ented to this treaty with no other view than that of gaining time, until he &s;hould be in a condition to make him&s;elf amends, for the damage he had &s;u&s;|tained. <NOTE PLACE="marg">H$$$$ng.</NOTE></P>
<P>Anlaf was no &s;ooner e&s;tabli&s;hed in peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Northumberland, than he laid &s;evere taxes upon his &s;ubjects, in order to di&s;charge the debts which he had contracted with the king of Norway, by who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance he had acquired the crown; and by the&s;e impo&s;itions he lo&s;t the affection of his &s;ubjects.

<P>Edmund, looking upon this as a favourable opportunity for retrieving the dominions he had ceded, began his march towards the north, and arrived upon the frontiers of Northumberland before the two kings had the lea&s;t inti|mation of his approach. Thus &s;urpri&s;ed, before they were in a po&s;ture of de|fence, they were obliged to abandon the i&s;land, and Edmund made him&s;elf<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann. Sax. M.

The homage which the Scotti&s;h kings in the &s;equel payed to the Engli&s;h monarch for the&s;e territories, was in all probability the foundation of the Engli&s;h claim to the &s;overeignty of all Scotland; though, by the &s;ame way of rea&s;oning, the kings of England were afterwards va&s;&s;als of France, be|cau&s;e they did homage to the French king for the dutchy of Normandy.</P>

<P>Edmund's attention was not intirely engro&s;&s;ed by the operations of war. He likewi&s;e employed his &s;tudy to improve the civil policy of his king|dom; and the laws which he enacted evidently prove how much he had the hap|pine&s;s of his &s;ubjects at heart. Ob&s;erving that pecuniary mulcts were very in&s;uf|ficient penalties for re&s;training thieves and robbers, who have generally very little to lo&s;e, he ordained that the elde&s;t member of the gang &s;hould be hanged upon conviction; for, theft had never before been puni&s;hed with death in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brompton$</NOTE> England. The kingdom would in all probability have flouri&s;hed in every branch of culture under a prince of &s;uch excellent talents, had not he been cut off in the flower of his age by a very unfortunate and extraordinary accident. While he &s;at at table with his nobles, celebrating the fea&s;t of Augu&s;tine, at Pukelkirk in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, he e&s;pied among the croud a notorious felon called Leof,
<PB N="159" REF="1680">
whom he had bani&s;hed for theft and rapine: he immediately commanded his &s;ew|er to &s;eize the pre&s;umptuous thief, who had thus intruded him&s;elf even into the royal pre&s;ence; but perceiving that this officer was not able to manage the de|linquent, he him&s;elf &s;tarted from table, and pulled him to the ground by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Leof, knowing that an ignominious death awaited him, drew forth a dagger which was concealed under his cloaths; and while the king lay upon him, &s;heathed it in the bo&s;om of his prince, who immediately expired. The death of the murderer, whom the noblemen immediately hewed in pieces, was but a poor atonement for the lo&s;s of &s;uch a valuable king thus cut off in the flower of his youth, after he had reigned about &s;ix years, during which he had given &s;uch &s;pecimens of his extraordinary courage, ability, and regard for the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann.

<P>THE two &s;ons of Edmund by his wife Elgiva, being infants, his brother Edred a&s;cended the throne with the unanimous &s;uffrages of the nobi|lity and clergy; and immediately after his elevation he marched into Northum|berland to quell the commotions which his brother's death had excited among the Danes of that province, who were &s;till watching an opportunity of with|drawing<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hunting.</NOTE> them&s;elves from the Engli&s;h government. As they found Edred in their country before they had taken any effectual mea&s;ures to maintain their in|dependency, they were obliged to &s;ubmit to the terms which he was plea&s;ed to propo&s;e; and their example was followed by Malcolm king of Scotland, whom

they had engaged to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in their revolt. He had no &s;ooner returned to his own dominions after this expedition, than the Danes, ever impatient of the Saxon yoke, re&s;olved to make another attempt to retrieve their liberty; and re|called Anlaf from Ireland with &s;uch &s;ecrecy and diligence, that this prince had reduced the mo&s;t con&s;iderable places in Northumberland, before Edred could a&s;&s;emble his troops to oppo&s;e his progre&s;s. Indeed Anlaf made &s;uch good u&s;e of his time, that he was too firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed on the throne of Northumberland, to be attacked with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, and therefore Edred left him for the pre&s;ent in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his conque&s;t. But, his own tyrannical di&s;po&s;ition produced &s;uch di&s;content among his &s;ubjects, and excited &s;uch a powerful faction again&s;t him, that he was fain to relinqui&s;h his throne, which they filled<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Neverthele&s;s one party &s;till continuing attached to the exiled Anlaf, the kingdom, as u&s;ual, was divided into de&s;perate factions, and Edred took this opportunity to reduce it under his power: with this view he marched into Northumberland, which he found in anarchy and confu&s;ion; and at his approach Eric fled for refuge into Scotland.</P>

<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; II.</HEAD>
<P>The Danes finding them&s;elves thus de&s;erted by their prince, and de&s;ti|tute of all means of oppo&s;ition, implored the clemency of Edred with the mo&s;t abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and &s;olemn vows of future fidelity. The&s;e he credited, and even re&s;tored their king Eric to the throne, on certain re&s;trictions; and having as he thought appea&s;ed the troubles of Northumberland to the intire &s;atisfaction of the people, he &s;et out from York on his return to We&s;&s;ex, marching without much circum&s;pection, among a people whom his genero&s;ity had laid under &s;uch obligations. But, the ungrateful Danes perceiving the negligence and di&s;order in which the Engli&s;h proceeded, a&s;&s;embled and armed them&s;elves in private; then fell upon Edred's rear &s;o &s;uddenly, that nothing but his own per&s;onal valour and conduct could have &s;aved his whole army from being cut in pieces. In|cen&s;ed at &s;uch a flagrant proof of their perfidy and ingratitude, he marched back into the heart of their country, which he re&s;olved to de&s;troy with fire and &s;word, and their ruin would have been inevitable, had they attempted to act in their own defence. But, in this extremity, they once more humbled them&s;elves before the conqueror, laying the blame of what had happened upon Eric, whom they put to death as a victim offered to the indignation of Edred, who being appea&s;ed by the&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions and apologies, reinforced with a round &s;um of money, for|gave<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>The&s;e tumults were &s;ucceeded by a profound calm, during which Edred's &s;uper&s;tition took the lead of his other pa&s;&s;ions, and manife&s;ted it&s;elf in an impli|cit obedience which he payed to Dun&s;tan abbot of Gla&s;ton, who not only acted as his gho&s;tly director, and in that quality gave him corporeal di&s;cipline with his own hand, but al&s;o acquired &s;uch influence over him in temporal affairs, that nothing either in church or &s;tate was executed without his advice and concurrence. It was by his coun&s;el that almo&s;t all the benefices of the kingdom were be&s;towed upon monks, and the &s;ecular clergy totally neglected and &s;et a&s;ide. Though this partiality rai&s;ed up a number of enemies again&s;t him, which was not dimini&s;h|ed by the pride and in&s;olence of his behaviour, it &s;ecured the whole body of monks in his intere&s;t, and that indefatigable race took all opportunities of &s;ound|ing

his prai&s;e, and repre&s;enting him as a prophet and apo&s;tle. The&s;e encomi|u$$s repeated on all occa&s;ions made an impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of the ignorant vulgar, and he was in a fair way of acquiring an ab&s;olute authority both in church and &s;tate, when he was checked in the middle of his career by the death<NOTE PLACE="marg">S$$. D$nelm.</NOTE> of the king, who died of a quincy in the tenth year of his reign. Feeling his end approaching, he &s;ent for Dun&s;tan, who happened to be ab&s;ent, in order to &s;ettle his &s;piritual affairs, as well as &s;ome temporal concerns unknown to every body but the abbot, who con&s;cious of having in his hands certain large &s;ums, for which he had not yet accounted, protracted the time on various pretences, un|til the king had expired, and then appropriated the money to his own u&s;e: an acqui&s;ition which enabled him to live with great &s;plendour and magnificence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A$$ Ch. $word$</NOTE> Thus died Edred, who degenerated from the virtues of his predece&s;&s;ors in no|thing but his blind attachment to this in&s;olent and rapacious abbot. He was the fir&s;t of all the Saxon monarchs, who a&s;&s;umed the title of king of Great Britain; a circum&s;tance that favours the opinions of tho&s;e who affirm that the king of Scotland held his crown as a fief depending upon England. Though he had two &s;ons called Bertfred and Elfred, who were of age at his death, he was &s;ucceeded by his nephew Edwy, &s;on of Edmund, who was elected monarch by the &s;uffrages of the nobility and clergy. This elective power was in all pro|bability a privilege which they retained when they fir&s;t &s;ubmitted to monarchical government; and a very wi&s;e precaution to prevent the mi&s;chiefs that attend the admini&s;tration of an infant king.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; IV.</HEAD>
<P>Edwy, who a&s;cended the throne at the age of fourteen, was a prince of great per&s;onal beauty, and a very amiable di&s;po&s;ition; but, he looked upon Dun&s;tan in a very different light from that in which he had been con&s;idered by his predece&s;&s;or. On the very day of his coronation, he conceived a di&s;gu&s;t at that officious abbot, for an affront, which a young prince could not ea&s;ily forgive. Edwy having withdrawn from the tire&s;ome ceremony of the day, to enjoy the conver&s;ation of a young lady called Athelgiva, of who&s;e beauty and rare accompli&s;hments he was deeply enamoured; Dun&s;tan no &s;ooner perceived his ab&s;ence, than he ru&s;hed furiou&s;ly into the apartment to which he had retired, and dragged him forth in the mo&s;t outrageous manner, after having rebuked him for his effeminancy with all the bitterne&s;s of eccle&s;ia&s;tical rancour. Such an unmannerly and un&s;ea&s;onable in&s;ult could not fail to in&s;pire the young monarch with re&s;entment; and the nobles, who were &s;candalized at the overbearing pride and profu&s;ion of the abbot, improved this di&s;po&s;ition by inveighing again&s;t his avarice and pre&s;umption, and in&s;inuating that he had embezzled the trea&s;ure belonging to the late king, which he now &s;quan|dered away in purcha&s;ing a dangerous popularity. In con&s;equence of the&s;e re|mon&s;trances, the king demanded re&s;titution of the &s;ums which Edred had com|mitted to his charge; and Dun&s;tan replied they had been expended in pious $&s;es, according to the king's direction. As the council did not think proper to urge him farther in this affair, they re&s;olved to rever&s;e and annul every &s;tep he had taken in favour of the monks, and immediately deprived them of all the be|nefices they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, filling their places with the &s;ecular clergy.</P>

<P>The exile of this reputed &s;aint, added to the &s;ufferings of the monks, were hollowed in the ears of the people, as &s;uch flagrant in&s;tances of the king's impiety, that all the eccle&s;ia&s;tical part of the kingdom e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of their apo&s;tle and his brethren; and Odo, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, was &s;o far tran&s;ported with the &s;pirit of fanatici&s;m, that he pronounced a formal divorce between Edwy and Athelgiva, that he might wound the king in the mo&s;t ten|der part. Eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ures were of &s;uch con&s;equence in tho&s;e days, that the king could no longer, with any regard to his own &s;afety, maintain his amorous corre&s;pondence, but was obliged to &s;urrender his mi&s;tre&s;s to the pe|nance of the church; and that unrelenting prelate ordered her to be branded in the face, and then exiled to Ireland.</P>

<P>Not contented with having taken &s;uch unmanly vengeance, this tur|bulent bi&s;hop, and the other adherents of Dun&s;tan and his monks, fir&s;t created malecontents by the mo&s;t &s;candalous calumnies invented again&s;t Edwy, and then in&s;tigated them to open rebellion, under the pretence of dethroning &s;uch an un|worthy king, and transferring the crown to his brother Edgar, who being an ambitious prince, of very in&s;inuating qualifications, willingly lent his name, in|tere&s;t, and per&s;onal activity, towards the &s;ucce&s;s of this enterprize. Having put him&s;elf at the head of the rebels, and &s;ecured the greate&s;t part of Mercia in his intere&s;t, he repaired to Northumberland and Ea&s;t-Anglia, where he found<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<HEAD>&sect; VIII.</HEAD>
<P>Thus &s;trengthened, his faction became &s;o powerful, that in a little time Edwy found him&s;elf abandoned by all his &s;ubjects, except the We&s;t-Saxons, and being unable to quell the rebellion, he retired for &s;helter to the city of Glouce&s;ter; while the &s;tates of Mercia a&s;&s;embling, deprived him in a formal manner of the &s;overeign power, and elected Edgar king of that realm, com|prehending all the country to the northward of the Thames, except the antient kingdom of E&s;&s;ex. As the monks had been principally concerned in this elec|tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flor. Wig. Sim. Dun. An. Ch. 959.</NOTE> they did not fail to give it the &s;anction of a miracle, which con&s;i&s;ted in a voice from heaven, commanding the a&s;&s;embled nobles to be&s;tow the crown up|on Edgar. After the ceremony of his coronation, a treaty was &s;et on foot with his brother Edwy, who yielding to the torrent of misfortune, con&s;ented to a partition, which deprived him of the be&s;t part of his dominions; but the mor|tification of &s;eeing him&s;elf thus &s;tripped of his territories, and the monks tri|umphing in his di&s;grace, threw him into a deep melancholy, which conducted him to the grave, after he had &s;urvived or rather lingered out a painful exi&s;tence, two years beyond the aera of his misfortune.</P>
<P>Edgar had no &s;ooner mounted the throne of Mercia, than Dun&s;tan returned to England, and recovered, at the court of this prince, all the influence he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the preceding reign. He was immediately promoted to the &s;ee of Worce&s;ter, and his &s;uppo&s;ed &s;anctity &s;hining out with double &s;plendor, after

<P>Edwy dying without i&s;&s;ue, the whole kingdom was re-united under Edgar, who, though in the prime of his youth, had already given undeniable proofs of a &s;hining genius, and the mo&s;t &s;olid under&s;tanding. He had manife&s;t|ed his ability in making him&s;elf ma&s;ter of his brother's dominions, and he af|terwards demon&s;trated the exten&s;ivene&s;s of his capacity, by keeping his &s;ubjects in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and his enemies in fear, without &s;training the regal authority, or engaging in any martial enterpri&s;e. But, he awed his neighbours by taking &s;uch mea&s;ures for the defence of his kingdom, as di&s;abled them from invading it with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. He divided Northumberland into two govern|ments, and con&s;tantly maintained a &s;trong body of forces in the northern pro|vinces, that they might be at hand to quell any in&s;urrection that &s;hould happen among that turbulent people: and, in order to &s;ecure his dominions from the de&s;cents of foreign Danes, he equipped a very &s;trong fleet, amounting to three thou&s;and five hundred ve&s;&s;els, divided into different &s;quadrons, and &s;tationed in &s;uch a manner that they were continually crui&s;ing round the i&s;land, which was<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fl$$. Wigorn. G. Malme&s;$. Mat. We&s;tm.</NOTE> thus effectually covered from in&s;ult. Such wife precautions could not fail to e&s;tabli&s;h peace and tranquility among his people, which in order to fix beyond any po&s;&s;ibility of interruption, he engaged Kenneth, king of Scotland, in his in|tere&s;t, by ceding to him the whole country of Lothian, extending from the Tweed to the Forth; for which, and the northern counties already be&s;towed upon Malcolm, that prince certainly did homage. It was in all probability owing to this ce&s;&s;ion and treaty, which &s;ecured the Scotti&s;h king as an ally, that Maccu&s;e, king of Man and the i&s;les, &s;ome toparchs of Galloway, and the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 959.</NOTE> princes of Wales, &s;ubmitted &s;o peaceably to the government of Edgar. The&s;e were the princes who vi&s;ited the court at Che&s;ter, and rowed his barge down the river Dee, while he him&s;elf &s;at at the helm; a circum&s;tance which &s;ome hi&s;|torians have con&s;idered as an act of homage, whereas it appears to have been no more than a compliment or frolic, acted in an excur&s;ion of plea&s;ure, that could admit of no &s;erious con&s;ideration or con&s;equence.</P>

<P>Notwith&s;tanding all his vigilance and care, in maintaining the peace of his &s;ubjects, it was &s;till interrupted by two dome&s;tic evils, namely, an infi|nite number of wolves that came down from the mountains of Wales $$&s;troy|ing the &s;heep and alarming the neighbourhood; and corrupted civil magi&s;trates, who oppre&s;&s;ed the people by a partial di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice. In order to free the country from the fir&s;t of the&s;e plagues, Edgar changed the tribute of the Welch into three hundred wolves heads, to be yearly payed in lieu of money and cattle; and publi&s;hed a general amne&s;ty for all crimes committed before a certain term, provided the criminals would produce an appointed number of wolves tongues, according to the nature of the crimes they had committed: an expedient &s;o effectual, that in three years the &s;pecies of that animal was ut|terly de&s;troyed in England. With re&s;pect to the magi&s;tracy, as it was a mat|ter of far greater importance, he enacted a law, by which every magi&s;trate con|victed of having pronounced an unju&s;t deci&s;ion, was mulcted in a &s;um of money, if it proceeded from ignorance; but if a wilful abu&s;e, he was rendered incapa|ble of holding that or any other office in the kingdom. And the king him&s;elf
<PB N="165" REF="1740">
made a yearly circuit through the different parts of his dominions to redre&s;s the injured, and take cognizance of the guilty.</P>

<P>The great qualities of Edgar were certainly very commendable; but in all probability his prai&s;es would not have been &s;o loudly &s;ounded, had not the monks found in him a zealous patron, and munificent benefactor. He is &s;aid to have founded forty mona&s;teries, and to have repaired and embelli&s;hed a much greater number, which he endowed, not with liberality, but profu&s;ion, alienating the crown lands for the &s;upport of tho&s;e idle and pernicious drones.</P>
<P>All the&s;e benefactions were &s;ugge&s;ted by Dun&s;tan, who not only enjoyed the &s;ee of Worce&s;ter, but was al&s;o made admini&s;trator of the vacant bi&s;hopric of Lon|don. He had, by this time, acquired &s;uch reputation among the people for his &s;anctity and miracles, which the monks did not fail to atte&s;t and exaggerate, and gained &s;uch an a&s;cendancy over the mind of Edgar, that he reigned ab&s;olute ma&s;ter in military, civil, and eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs. Brethelm, bi&s;hop of Bath, a very worthy and pious prelate, but no favourer of the monks, being elected to the &s;ee of Canterbury, at the death of archbi&s;hop Elfin, the king re|&s;olved to procure that dignity for his favourite, and a&s;&s;embled a general coun|cil, in which he harangued again&s;t the inability of Brethelm, and recommend|ed Dun&s;tan &s;o warmly, that the former was &s;ent back to his original dioce&s;e, and the other elevated to the archbi&s;hopric of Canterbury. As this election was not altogether canonical, it was found nece&s;&s;ary to demand the pope's confirma|tion, and Dun&s;tan immediately &s;et out for Rome, on pretence of receiving the pall. The pope, who was well informed of his great credit at court, and his zeal for the intere&s;t of the Roman church, not only confirmed his election, but al&s;o created him his legate in England, with a very exten&s;ive authority. He then returned in triumph, and promoted his relation O&s;wald to the &s;ee of Wor|ce&s;ter, and hat of Winche&s;ter was given to Ethelwold, his intimate friend: &s;o that this triumvirate acting in concert, governed the king and the whole church of England. Dun&s;tan being now too firmly rooted in his power to dread the efforts of his enemies, re&s;olved to execute the grand project he had<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sim. Dun.

<P>The&s;e indu&s;trious emi&s;&s;aries let &s;lip no opportunity of inveighing again&s;t the luxury and libertini&s;m of the &s;ecular clergy, who certainly did not lead the mo&s;t regular lives; and the minds of the people being thus prepared, the king a&s;&s;e$bled a council, and in a &s;tudied oration declaimed again&s;t the ir|regularities of $word$ prie&s;ts, their riots, their amours, and debauchery; then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;el$$ Dun&s;tan and his confederates, conjured them to take &s;ome effectual methods for reforming &s;uch enormous abu&s;es. As this &s;peech was evi|dently levelled again&s;t the &s;ecular clergy, the friends of that body would not ven|ture to oppo&s;e the king's inclination, and the triumvirate of bi&s;hops took the fir&s;t opportunity of expelling the &s;eculars from all the churches and convents under their juri&s;diction and influence. Perhaps this expul&s;ion would not have been &s;o ea&s;ily executed, had not the &s;ecular prie&s;ts incurred the cen&s;ure of the com|mon<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. We&s;tmin&s;t. G.

<P>After this &s;ignal &s;ervice rendered to the monks, Edgar was celebrated not on|ly as the greate&s;t monarch, but al&s;o as the holie&s;t king that ever reigned in
<PB N="166" REF="1750">
England. His brother Edwy had been reviled and even excommunicated as an impious wretch, for carrying on a &s;imple intrigue with the fair Athelgiva, whom &s;ome hi&s;torians &s;uppo&s;e to have been his wife, though the marriage was within the degrees of con&s;anguinity prohibited by the canon law. We have al|ready &s;een how that poor lady was branded by the fanatic Odo, and tran&s;|ported to Ireland, though he had no legal power to inflict corporal puni&s;hment on the meane&s;t &s;ubject. On her return &s;he was ham-&s;trung by the &s;ame au|dac$ous prelate, while her unhappy lover, unable to protect her from &s;uch bar|barity, or even to revenge her wrongs, was publicly calumniated as a tyrant and an adulterer, and even deprived of the be&s;t part of his dominions by the arts and in&s;tigations of tho&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tical traitors. But Edgar, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions were more irregular, indulged them with impunity, even to unpardonable ex|ce&s;s: he committed a rape upon a nun, by whom he had a daughter named Editha, who afterwards di&s;tingui&s;hed her&s;elf for her great piety, in con&s;e|quence of which &s;he was canonized. For this &s;acrilege, which in Edwy would have been unpardonable, all the penance which Dun&s;tan inflicted, was a &s;light cen&s;ure, which delayed the coronation of Edgar, who neverthele&s;s enjoyed his plea&s;ure without controul, deflowering the daughters of his &s;ubjects, and &s;natch|ing<NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

<P>His fir&s;t wife was Elfleda, &s;urnamed the Fair, daughter of a noble|man called Ordmer, by whom he had Edward his immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and he afterwards married Elfrida, the beauteous heire&s;s of Devon&s;hire, who&s;e &s;tory is too remarkable to be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence. This young lady had been edu|cated at home, under the in&s;pection of her father Ordung count of Devon, who had no other child; but, notwith&s;tanding her retired life, the fame of her beauty and accompli&s;hments reached the ears of Edgar, who employed his favourite Ethelwald to vi&s;it the father on &s;ome pretext, which would afford an opportu|nity of &s;eeing the daughter, that he might certainly know whether or not her beauty really ju&s;tified the report he had heard. Ethelwald no &s;ooner &s;aw the fair Elfrida than his own heart was captivated; and, in order to detach the king intirely from this &s;ubject, he de&s;cribed her in &s;uch a manner as dive&s;ted Edgar of all curio&s;ity to be further acquainted with her per&s;on. Having weaned the king's thoughts from Elfrida, he took occa&s;ion to repre&s;ent to his maje&s;ty the advantages he him&s;elf &s;hould reap from &s;uch a profitable match, and having obtained permi&s;|&s;ion to demand her in marriage from the father, &s;ucceeded in his &s;uit. Soon after he had thus accompli&s;hed his aim, &s;ome courtier, who owed him a grudge, ex|plained the whole my&s;tery to Edgar, who, though extremely incen&s;ed at the trea|chery of Ethelwald, di&s;&s;embled his re&s;entment, until he &s;hould have an opportu|nity of inve&s;tigating the truth by the evidence of his own &s;en&s;es. He accord|ingly found &s;ome pretence for hunting or travelling near Ethelwald's hou&s;e, and declared his intention of vi&s;iting the lady who had been the &s;ubject of &s;o much conver&s;ation. He was then fully convinced of Ethelwald's prefidious dealing; yet he &s;till di&s;gui&s;ed his indignation, and in a little time the favou|rite was found murdered in a wood. The &s;u&s;picion fell immediately on the king, becau&s;e he took no &s;teps to di&s;cover the perpetrators of the murder, but, as &s;oon as decency would permit, married the widow, by whom he had Edmund, who died in his infancy, and Ethelred, who lived to reign in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>

Malme&s;b. M. We&s;t.</NOTE> Edgar, far from having any title to this preheminence, was a prince of a very mixed character, in which the vicious pa&s;&s;ions very often predominated; though we grant him to have been a &s;ound politician, an excellent legi&s;lator, and a mo|narch who&s;e abilities were employed for the benefit of his country, we mu&s;t own at the &s;ame time that he a&s;cended the throne of Mercia by the mo&s;t flagrant inju&s;tice; that he was &s;uper&s;titious in his religion, lawle&s;s in his pa&s;&s;ion, and bloody in his revenge; for, exclu&s;ive of the vengeance upon Ethelwald, he de&s;troy|ed the whole i&s;le of Thanet with fire and &s;word, becau&s;e a few of the inhabitants had been concerned in plundering &s;ome merchants from York. He extended<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brompton.</NOTE> his liberality to men of learning and genius; his court was ho&s;pitable and mag|nificent, and generally filled with a concour&s;e of foreigners, who were charmed with his elegance and politene&s;s: and from the tranquillity of his reign, he ac|quired the denomination of Edgar the Pacific <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Tho' he was &s;mall in &s;tature, and of a &s;lender m$ke, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an uncommon &s;hare of per|&s;onal &s;trength and agility, and was very dexte|rous at all the exerci&s;es of the times. Nor was his pacific reign owing to any defect in point of courage, as he demon&s;trated on different oc|ca&s;ions. Kenneth, king of Scotland, while he re&s;ided at his court, is &s;aid to have ridiculed the diminutive &s;tature of Edgar, one night while he was intoxicated with liquor. His unman|nerly je&s;t being reported to the king, he made &s;ome pretence to walk along with Kenneth in|to an unfrequented place, where giving him to under&s;tand that he was informed of the con|tempt he had expre&s;&s;ed for his per&s;on, he de|&s;ired him to draw his &s;word, and he would con|vince him of his mi&s;take, if he thought courage depended upon the mu&s;cles of the body. Ken|neth, &s;truck with this in&s;tance of magnanimity, begged pardon for the rudene&s;s of his behaviour, which he imputed to his intoxication: and Ed|gar admitted of his apology. The Scotti&s;h hi&s;|torians deny the truth of this circum&s;tance, as if they thought it derogated from the courage of Kenneth; though it rather redounds to the ho|nour of his memory, as it proves he had &s;en&s;e and candour to make reparation for the offence he had given.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>Immediately after the decea&s;e of Edgar, Elfser duke of Mercia, &s;worn enemy to the monks, expelled them from all the benefices in his country, which he filled again with &s;ecular prie&s;ts; &s;ome other noblemen followed his example in different parts of the kingdom, but the duke of Ea&s;t Anglia and many other per&s;ons of the fir&s;t rank adhered to Dun&s;tan and his party, which was like|wi&s;e e&s;pou&s;ed by almo&s;t the whole body of the commons, who looked upon that prelate as a &s;aint and apo&s;tle. This diver&s;ity of &s;entiments produced a con|te&s;t concerning the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; for, Elfrida the queen dowager, a woman of an ambitious &s;pirit, had by her emi&s;&s;aries circulated &s;ome doubts about the validity of Edgar's marriage with the mother of Edward, in hope of rai&s;ing her own &s;on Ethelred to the throne; and as the other was &s;upported by Dun&s;tan, all that prelate's enemies declared for the &s;on of Elfrida. Tho' by the&s;e means, there was a very powerful faction formed in his favour, the archbi&s;hop, confiding in his great popularity, aro&s;e from the a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates while they were delibe|rating upon the choice of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or to Edgar, and taking prince Edward by the hand, conducted him to the church, where he was anointed and con&s;ecrated

<P>Dun&s;tan, having thus &s;ecured the continuance of his own power and<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> intere&s;t, exerted all his endeavours to maintain the monks in the benefices which they had acquired in the preceding reign, and even employed the king's authority in their behalf. But, as little regard was paid to the declaration of a minor prince, intirely under his direction and influence, he had recour&s;e to miracles, which more effectually an&s;wered his purpo&s;e. His propo&s;als in council were &s;econded by a &s;peaking crucifix, and a vi&s;ion of St. Andrew; and at a mixed a&s;&s;embly compo&s;ed of the laity and clergy, who had met at Calne in Wilt&s;hire, the debates running high again&s;t the monks, the whole roof of the hou&s;e fell down, and cru&s;hed a number of people to death, while the beam under which St. Dun&s;tan's chair was placed, continued firm and immoveable, and defended the holy bi&s;hop, who &s;u&s;tained no damage, though every other per&s;on in the a&s;&s;embly was either killed or wounded.

The king returning one day from the chace in Dor&s;et&s;hire, rode up &s;ingly to the gate of Corf ca&s;tle, to pay a compliment to his mother-in-law Elfrida, who invited him very courteou&s;ly to alight; and finding him in a hurry to begone, in&s;i&s;ted upon his drinking a cup of wine as he &s;at on hor&s;eback; the young prince complied with her reque&s;t, and as he &s;wallowed the liquor, was &s;tabbed in the back by one of her dome&s;tics tutored for the purpo&s;e. Edward, finding him&s;elf wounded, clapped &s;purs to his hor&s;e, but he fainted with lo&s;s of blood, and his foot being entangled in the &s;tirrup, as he fell, was dragged a con&s;iderable way, when the hor&s;e made a &s;top of his own accord before the door of a poor old blind woman; there the &s;ervants of Elfrida, &s;ent by their mi&s;tre&s;s to know the i&s;&s;ue of her trea&s;on, found the unhappy prince quite dead, and terribly defaced by the flints over which he<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

As for Elfrida, &s;he was &s;eized with horror and remor&s;e for the inhuman crime &s;he had com|mitted; in order to attone for which, &s;he founded two mona&s;teries at Ambre&s;|bury in Wilt&s;hire, and Worwell in Northampton&s;hire; in the la&s;t of which &s;he<NOTE PLACE="marg">Malme&s;b. l. i$.</NOTE> endeavoured to expiate her guilt by a life of penance and mortification.</P>

But, this ceremony he performed with &s;uch malevo|lence as plainly evinced the rancour of his heart; for, in the very act of placing the crown upon this young prince's head, he prophecied that his reign &s;hould be cur&s;ed with the mi&s;ery and &s;laughter of his &s;ubjects, becau&s;e he had &s;ucceed|ed to the crown in con&s;equence of his mother's guilt, to which this inocent youth was &s;o far from being acce&s;&s;ary, that he bewailed his brother's death with all the bitterne&s;s of &s;orrow, and thereby incurred his mother's di&s;plea&s;ure and ha|tred. Had Ethelred inherited the &s;pirit of his father, Dun&s;tan's prophecy would in all probability have been fal&s;ified: but, he was a prince of very mean parts, though very amiable in his per&s;on; his education had been neglected be|fore his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, and now that he found him&s;elf ve&s;ted with the regal power, without knowledge or re&s;olution, he was involved in a labyrinth of perplexity, which was increa&s;ed by his natural timidity, indolence and di&s;tru&s;t. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Flor.

<P>Such being the di&s;po&s;ition and inexperience of the prince, nowon|der that the reins of government were relaxed, and all the nece&s;&s;ary precautions for the &s;ecurity of the kingdom, entirely neglected. The principal nobility who had been intru&s;ted with the government of different counties, perpetuated the admini&s;tration in their families, a&s;&s;umed the name of dukes, exerci&s;ed an inde|pendent authority in their own di&s;tricts, and di&s;regarded that union upon which alone the &s;afety and welfare of the nation could depend. The regulations of the militia were no longer ob&s;erved: the Engli&s;h gave them&s;elves up to effemi|nate plea&s;ures, and hired mercenaries to do the drudgery of war; and the&s;e hirelings were generally Danes, who had no intere&s;t but that of plundering the people whom they were employed to protect. Thus the Saxons expo&s;ed them|&s;elves, with the utmo&s;t temerity, to the de&s;igns of their mo&s;t inveterate ene|my; and the government, as if it had con&s;pired again&s;t the nation, &s;uffered its chief bulwark the navy to decay and peri&s;h, for want of maintenance and repair. The Danes, who were &s;ettled in England, &s;till retained their old de&s;ire of free|ing them&s;elves from the Engli&s;h yoke, and, in all probability, encouraged their countrymen to make a de&s;cent at this favourable juncture, when the government was weak, and the kingdom defencele&s;s.</P>

<P>As Ethelred paid very little regard to the monks, and had more than once made their leader Dun&s;tan feel the weight of his regal power, they &s;econd|ed the efforts of the Danes, by $omenting the &s;pirit of di&s;content and di&s;affec|tion, and exciting civil di&s;&s;en&s;ions, which di&s;abled the admini&s;tration from tak|ing effectual mea&s;ures to repul&s;e the enemy, who were moreover encouraged and joined by numbers of their own countrymen &s;ettled in England.

<P>After the Danes had for ten years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively pillaged the coa&s;ts of England, they di&s;continued their ravages, and the people enjoyed a re&s;pite of two years; &s;o that they began to hope the enemy had turned their arms again&s;t &s;ome other quarter of Europe. But, the&s;e hopes were fatally fru&s;trated; for,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W$ghorn. $$ron.

In this extremity Ethelred allowed him&s;elf to be per&s;uaded by Siric, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, to buy a peace with a &s;um of money; and the expedient &s;ucceeded &s;o far, that the Dani&s;h generals retired; but, at the &s;ame time, it encouraged other adventurers of that nation to try the like experiment. Accordingly a fleet of tho&s;e free-booters appeared in the cour&s;e of the en&s;uing year upon the coa&s;t of Ea&s;t-Anglia; but, on this occa&s;ion, Ethelred took a more wi&s;e and manly method of treating the enemy: he a&s;&s;em|bled a great number of &s;hips from all parts of the kingdom, at London, where he ordered them to be well manned and &s;upplied with munition of war: then be&s;towing the command of this armament upon Alfric, duke of Mercia, directed him to block up the Dani&s;h navy in the harbour in which it lay at anchor: but, the &s;cheme was defeated by the treachery of Alfric, who de&s;erted to the Danes, and gave them notice of the danger; &s;o that they put to &s;ea imme|diately, and e&s;caped. The king was &s;o much incen&s;ed at the traitor, that he

commanded the eyes of his children to be put out; yet was weak enough to receive him into favour again, and give him another opportunity to re|peat his trea&s;on. His motive for acting in this perfidious manner, was the de&s;ire of being revenged upon the king, for having exiled him after the death of his father, on account of &s;ome mi&s;conduct or trea&s;onable practices, for which Ethelred, who was his relation, had pardoned and re&s;tored him to his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron.

<P>Hitherto the Dani&s;h inva&s;ions had been no other than petty enter|prizes, atchieved by private adventurers: but, now Swein and Anlaf, kings of Denmark and Norway, allured by the &s;ucce&s;s of their &s;ubjects, re&s;olved to have a &s;hare of the &s;poils of England. For this purpo&s;e they equipped a nu|merous fleet, and &s;ailing up the Humber, ravaged Lind&s;ey, and wa&s;ted the greate&s;t part of York&s;hire. A body of troops was a&s;&s;embled to oppo&s;e them, and put under the command of three counts, who being of Dani&s;h extraction, betrayed their tru&s;t, and betook them&s;elves to flight in the very beginning of the engagement; &s;o that the Engli&s;h were routed, and the country became a prey to the conquerors. Here the victors fixed their winter-quarters, and in the &s;pring &s;ailing towards the Thames, entered that river without oppo&s;ition; then landing their troops, made &s;everal attempts upon London; but meeting with more re&s;i&s;tance than they had expected, they de&s;i&s;ted from that enterprize, and penetrated into the provinces of Kent, Hamp&s;hire, and Su&s;&s;ex, which they laid wa&s;te with fire and &s;word. As they threatened to over-run the whole king|dom in the &s;ame manner, Ethelred, being de&s;titute of all means of oppo&s;ition, had recour&s;e to his former expedient, and promi&s;ed to pay a con&s;iderable &s;um of money within a &s;pecified time, on condition that they would immediately put a &s;top to ho&s;tilities, and quit the kingdom, as &s;oon as they &s;hould receive the tri|bute.

<P>Tho&s;e two princes &s;et &s;ail together for Denmark, though with ve|ry different intentions; tho&s;e of Anlaf were not more pacific, than Swein's were &s;avage and ho&s;tile towards the Engli&s;h king. He left a fleet at Southampton, commanded by an officer who had orders to pre&s;s the payment of the money; and if that &s;hould be delayed, to right him&s;elf with the &s;word. He accordingly demanded the immediate execution of the treaty, in the mo&s;t peremptory man|ner; and as Ethelred found great difficulty in rai&s;ing the money, he con&s;trued the delay into a refu&s;al, and re&s;olved to renew the war. Finding the country ad|joining to his quarters in a po&s;ture of defence, he &s;ailed round the Land's end of Cornwal, and entering the river Severne, made a de&s;cent upon Wales, which he de&s;olated with the utmo&s;t cruelty; then he penetrated into Dor&s;et&s;hire, which met with the &s;ame deplorable fate, and defeated the troops that were rai&s;ed for the defence of the country. Having ruined and pillaged whole provinces without further oppo&s;ition, they re-imbarked, and &s;ailed back to the coa&s;t of Kent, where an effort made by the inhabitants to check their progre&s;s, &s;erved only to incen&s;e them to a greater degree of barbarity and revenge, which they gratified with the mo&s;t inhuman brutality; and what compleated the mi&s;ery of England,

<P>The nation was then upon the verge of ruin, when it was delivered for the pre&s;ent by the dangerous &s;ituation of Richard II. duke of Normandy, who, being threatened by the king of France with the lo&s;s of his dominions, called the Danes over to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. By this accident Ethelred gained a re|mi&s;&s;ion of &s;ome months, during which, however, he does not &s;eem to have taken any mea&s;ures for the protection of his &s;ubjects: for the Danes, after hav|ing &s;ecured Richard in his dukedom, returned to Britain, which they found as defencele&s;s as before. They again ravaged Wales, over-ran We&s;&s;ex, reduced Exeter, and filled the country with &s;uch con&s;ternation, that the inhabitants fled before them, and the king was &s;eized with a panic that prevented him from taking the field in per&s;on, or forming any re&s;olution in behalf of his &s;ubjects. The Danes proceeded without let or mole&s;tation, until they had &s;ubdued the I&s;le of Wight, together with the counties of Hants and Dor&s;et, where they e&s;tabli&s;hed magazines, and from whence they made irruptions into the neigh|bouring di&s;tricts. While the &s;outhern parts of the kingdom were thus ravaged by the foreign Danes, the northern provinces were occupied by the Engli&s;h breed of the &s;ame nation, who, in&s;tead of fighting in defence of what was now their country, joined their countrymen, and contributed to its de&s;truction.</P>

<P>Ethelred &s;eeing his realm reduced to this mi&s;erable &s;ituation, obeyed the dictates of his fear and de&s;pondence, and &s;umittted to pay thirty thou&s;and pounds to tho&s;e invaders; a &s;um that was rai&s;ed by a tax di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Danegelt. In con&s;ideration of this tribute, the main body of Danes retired to their own country; though a good number cho&s;e to fix their habita|tion in England, where being &s;upported by the natives of the &s;ame race, they became extremely in&s;olent and oppre&s;&s;ive, living at their ea&s;e upon the labour of the Engli&s;h, who were by this time &s;o di&s;pirited by their pa&s;t misfortunes, that<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron.

The duke of Normandy had hitherto favoured the Danes, who were indeed his own countrymen, in all their expeditions to England; and as his ports were exact|ly oppo&s;ite to the Briti&s;h coa&s;t, tho&s;e pyrates found great convenience in being able to run acro&s;s the channel occa&s;ionally, and &s;ecure their plunder by return|ing to the Norman harbours.

<P>They found means to draw &s;uch an agreeable pro&s;pect of the con|&s;equences which would attend this inhuman &s;acrifice, that the impotent prince agreed to the propo&s;al, and mea&s;ures were in&s;tantly concerted for carrying it into execution. The orders were &s;o di&s;tinct, and circulated with &s;uch &s;ecrecy, that the mi&s;erable victims never dreamed of the horrible vengeance that hung over their heads, and on St. Brice's day, the time fixed for the ma&s;&s;acre, they were all butchered by the vindictive Saxons, without di&s;tinction of age or &s;ex. It was not &s;o much a &s;acrifice to liberty, as a fea&s;t of carnage to gratify revenge, for the &s;laughter was attended with circum&s;tances of the mo&s;t &s;avage cruelty.

<P>The reader will doubtle&s;s be amazed at the infatuation of this unhappy prince, who not only employed the wor&s;t of traitors in the fir&s;t offices of the kingdom, even after he had &s;uffered by repeated in&s;tances of their per|fidy; but con&s;ented to impoveri&s;h his country by rai&s;ing &s;uch exorbitant &s;ums, which far from &s;atisfying, &s;erved only to whet the avarice of tho&s;e invaders, and encourage the re&s;t of their countrymen to engage in the like enterprizes. Scarce had the Engli&s;h begun to ta&s;te the happine&s;s of their deliverance, when Swein entered the Humber with &s;uch a powerful armament as threatened the whole kingdom with de&s;olation. He &s;aw not the lea&s;t &s;hadow of oppo&s;ition in making him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Northumberland, Ea&s;t Anglia, and all the country to the northward of Watling-&s;treet; but not contented with the&s;e conque&s;ts, he took ho&s;tages from the principal towns, and leaving the government of the province he had &s;ubdued to his &s;on Canute, he made an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt upon London; from whence he marched into We&s;&s;ex, which he plundered at his lei|&s;ure, for there was not the face of an enemy to be &s;een. Re&s;olved to reduce Lon|don, he began to make preparations for the &s;iege of that city; but, while he was thus employed, the unhappy Ethelred, &s;eeing there was no &s;afety for him in his own kingdom, retired privately to the i&s;le of Wight, from whence he &s;ent his two &s;ons into Normandy, with their mother Emma, in order to prevail upon Richard to afford him refuge in his dominions.

As for the inhabitants of London, they thought them&s;elves at liberty, by the king's abdication and retreat, to provide for their own &s;afety; and as the place was not in a condition to &s;u&s;tain a &s;iege, they &s;ub|mitted to the king of Denmark, who had by this time &s;ubjected all the re&s;t of the kingdom; and Swein was proclaimed king of England, in which there<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

The monks pretended he was mortally wounded by the &s;pirit of St. Edmund, becau&s;e he threatened to lay under contribution the mona&s;tery in which that monarch was interred; but in all probability he was poi&s;oned by tho&s;e hone&s;t eccle&s;ia&s;tics, who began to perceive that he would pay very little regard to their privileges and exemptions.

He was &s;o &s;urprized at the &s;udden approach and activity of Ethelred, who had hitherto been dilatory even to a proverb, that he retreated to his &s;hips with precipitation, and &s;et &s;ail for Denmark, leav|ing his friends at Lind&s;ey to the mercy of the Engli&s;h monarch, who de&s;troyed their habitations, and puni&s;hed their per&s;ons with the utmo&s;t &s;everity.

It was not &s;o much the fear of Ethelred's arms that induced him to leave the kingdom at this juncture, as the ambition of his own younger brother Harold, who at his fa|ther's death had attempted to a&s;cend the throne of Denmark, which Canute was not at all di&s;po&s;ed to give up for the uncertain pro&s;pect of &s;ucceeding in his de&s;igns upon England.</P>

<P>Ethelred no &s;ooner &s;aw him&s;elf delivered from the Danes, than he re|lap&s;ed into his former indolence and mi&s;conduct.

Morcart and Sigeferth, two noblemen of Dani&s;h extraction, who had been always faithful to his intere&s;t, were now &s;acrificed to his avarice. During the &s;e&s;&s;ion of a general council at Oxford, Edric the execrable duke of Mercia, and &s;on-in law to the king, employed a&s;&s;a&s;&s;$$s by whom they were murdered; and Ethelred imme|diately confi&s;cated their e&s;tates for his own u&s;e, as if they had been fairly con|demned in the ordinary cour&s;e of law; while Sigeferth's widow Algitha was &s;hut up in a cloi&s;ter; though to this confinement &s;he afterwards owed her elevat|ed fortune.

<P>The calm enjoyed by England after the retreat of Canute, was of very &s;hort duration: that prince having &s;ecured him&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his pa|ternal crown, re&s;umed his de&s;ign upon this country; and when he was lea&s;t ex|pected, landed with a numerous body of forces at Sandwich. Ethelred him|&s;elf being indi&s;po&s;ed, his &s;on Edmund and the traitor Streon Duke of Mercia took the command of the army, and the prince was in a very little time con|vinced of the treachery of his brother-in-law. But, as he dur&s;t not puni&s;h him upon the &s;pot, le&s;t he &s;hould incur the hatred of the Mercians, among whom Edric had great influence, and the di&s;plea&s;ure of his father, who could not be per&s;uaded that the duke carried on a trea&s;onable corre&s;pondence with the enemy,

he divided the army into two bodies, that he might have the opportunity of act|ing &s;eparately from &s;uch a per&s;idious mi&s;creant, who finding him&s;elf thus baf|fled in his favourite aim, which was to betray Edmund, pulled off the ma&s;k, and openly declared for Canute. If his defection had affected only his own im|mediate va&s;&s;als, Ethelred would have been a gainer by his de&s;ertion; but he car|ried off a con&s;iderable body of troops, and forty &s;hips of the navy.</P>

<P>Such an acce&s;&s;ion of power to Canute enabled that prince to exe|cute all his projects without the lea&s;t difficulty; and the Engli&s;h people joined him in crouds, rather than be involved in the ruin of Ethelred, who was at length per&s;uaded by his &s;on to put him&s;elf at the head of his army, in order to &s;trike &s;ome deci&s;ive blow, by which alone he had any chance of retrieving his affairs. The pre&s;ence of the king and the popularity of Edmund had &s;till &s;uch influence among the Engli&s;h, that great numbers repaired to the royal &s;tandard; and as they were now actuated by a furious kind of de&s;pair, the Danes might have had cau&s;e to rue the encounter: but this opportunity was lo&s;t by the &s;hameful cowardice of Ethelred, who, pretending to have di&s;covered a de&s;ign of betraying his per&s;on to the enemy, retired precipitately to London; and the Mer|cians refu&s;ing to &s;erve when the monarch was no longer in the field, the army was &s;o weakened by their &s;ece&s;&s;ion, that Edmund could not pretend to ha|zard a battle with the Danes.</P>

<P>In this emergency he retired to the north, where he joined Uthred count of Northumberland, who had married his &s;i&s;ter Elfgiva, and ravaged the provinces which had declared for the Danes.

Even there they found them&s;elves &s;o hard pre&s;&s;ed by the enemy that Uthred &s;ubmitted to the Dani&s;h king, who allowed him to enjoy his government; but afterwards ordered him to be put to death, and appointed a Dani&s;h governour in his room. Edmund repaired<NOTE PLACE="marg">F$or Wig. Sim Dun.

Edmund, at the head of an army levied in the counties of Cornwal, Devon, Dor&s;et, and Somer&s;et, waited for him, at a place called Sceor&s;tan on the borders of Worce&s;ter; and there the battle began with great fury.

It la&s;ted until night parted the combatants, and next day was renewed with fre&s;h vigour. At length the Danes &s;eemed to flag; and the victory would, in all probability, have declared for Iron&s;ide, had not their drooping courage been revived by a &s;trata|gem of the perfidious Edric, who, cutting off the head of one O&s;mer, who re|&s;embled that prince, and expo&s;ing it on the point of a &s;pear, called aloud to the Engli&s;h to quit the field, for Edmund was &s;lain. This contrivance would have an&s;wered his purpo&s;e, in di&s;piriting the Saxons and animating the Danes, had not Edmund immediately lifted up his beaver, and &s;hewn him&s;elf to his &s;oldiers. Having taken this nece&s;&s;ary precaution, he rode up towards the treacherous Edric, and darted a javelin at him with &s;uch force, that though it mi&s;&s;ed the traitor, it pinned his next man to the &s;oldier that &s;tood behind him, and both fell breathle&s;s on the field.

But, Canute fore&s;eeing that he &s;hould not be able to maintain a third &s;hock, retired privately, by the help of a dark night, and returned to his &s;hips that were &s;till in the Thames, in order to renew the &s;iege of London. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sim.

This propo&s;ition was eagerly embraced by Edmund, and an equal number of commi&s;&s;ioners being appointed on each &s;ide, they a&s;&s;embled on the little i&s;land of Alney, in the Severne; and after a &s;hort conference, a treaty of peace was concluded, and the kingdom di|vided between the two competitors<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Huntingdon and Matthew of We&s;tmin&s;ter relate, that the noblemen of each army, wearied with ince&s;&s;ant war and fatigue, declared open|ly, that as Edmund and Canute wanted to reign &s;ingly, they ought to fight &s;ingly, and decide the contention between them&s;elves. The kings being informed of the&s;e clamours, agreed to fight in &s;ingle combat, and the i&s;land of Alney was appointed for the li&s;ts. There they met in ar|mour, while their re&s;pective armies lined the op|po&s;ite &s;ides of the river, and a mo&s;t furious en|counter en&s;ued. At la&s;t the Dane, finding his &s;trength exhau&s;ted, defired a parley, and pro|po&s;ed a partition of the kingdom; to which Ed|mund con&s;ented, and then throwing away their &s;words, they ran into each other's embrace, to the equal joy and a&s;toni&s;hment of both armies. The articles of the treaty were immediately &s;pe|cified and confirmed, and the two kings parted in amity.</NOTE>. All the country to the &s;outhward of the Thames, together with the city of London, and part of the antient kingdom of E&s;&s;ex, was a&s;&s;igned to Edmund; and all the re&s;t of England was allotted to Ca|nute. This divi&s;ion was approved by the two kings, who ratified the peace by oath and the exchange of armour: then the Dane retired to his own dominions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sim. Dunelm. Wallingford.

Thus fell the gallant Edmund by inglorious hands, before he had reigned a full year; though in that &s;hort period he had exhibited repeated proofs of the mo&s;t undaunted courage, invincible fortitude, con&s;ummate prudence, and &s;ublime genero&s;ity.

<P>THE Dane was &s;hocked at the barbarity of the murder; but he di&s;|gui&s;ed his &s;entiments, becau&s;e he had further occa&s;ion for the traitor$ and even promi&s;ed to exalt him above all the nobility of the kingdom; an aequi|vocal expre&s;&s;ion, which was literally verified, in a manner widely different from Edric's expectation. In the mean time Canute re&s;olved to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the kingdom of We&s;&s;ex, without paying any regard to the title of Edmund's two &s;ons, or that of his brothers, who re&s;ided in Normandy: but as he would not &s;eize it in quality of a conqueror, he a&s;&s;embled the &s;tates at London, after his emi&s;&s;aries had tutored the individual members in private, and claimed the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion by virtue of the treaty concluded in the i&s;le of Alney, which he pre|tended to interpret in a &s;en&s;e implying, that the &s;urvivor &s;hould inherit the do|minions of the decea&s;ed, without any regard to the children of either. The &s;tates of We&s;&s;ex, dreading the pro&s;pect of another war, and yet unwilling to in|jure the right of their own royal family, in&s;inuated to Canute, that they would willingly con&s;ent to his reigning over them as guardian to Edmund's elde&s;t &s;on: but he refu&s;ed to accept the crown on &s;uch precarious terms, and openly demanded in the a&s;&s;embly, of tho&s;e who had been pre&s;ent at the treaty, whether or not any thing had been &s;tipulated in favour of Edmund's children? When tho&s;e noble|men replied, that their names had not been mentioned on that occa&s;ion, he in|terpreted this &s;ilence into a confirmation of his claim; and there was no per&s;on pre&s;ent who had hone&s;ty and courage enough to oppo&s;e &s;uch a palpable u&s;urpa|tion. They unanimou&s;ly acknowledged his title. He was immediately pro|claimed king of all England. The Dani&s;h and Engli&s;h noblemen took the oath of allegiance, and he was afterwards crowned with great &s;olemnity. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Flor. Wig.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>&sect; II.</HEAD>
<P>Immediately after his coronation, he divided England into the four great governments of Mercia, Northumberland, Ea&s;t-Anglia, and We&s;&s;ex. The fir&s;t he conferred upon the infamous Edric Streon; the &s;econd he gave to Erick; the third was be&s;towed upon Turkell; and he re&s;erved We&s;&s;ex to him&s;elf, without appointing either duke or count of that province.</P>
<P>As he very well knew that a number of Engli&s;h noblemen repined in their hearts at his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, and that the people in general were &s;trongly attached to the race of Cerdic, his fir&s;t aim was to ingratiate him&s;elf with his new &s;ubjects by popular mea&s;ures; and to take the fir&s;t opportunity of removing tho&s;e who were the mo&s;t likely and capable to di&s;turb his government. With that view he affected to declare that he would make no difference between Danes and Engli&s;h in his favours and admini&s;tration; and then publi&s;hed an edict importing, that the old laws &s;hould be ob&s;erved in every province, as they were in the time of the Saxons; excepting however the provinces of the north, which were almo&s;t wholly peopled with Danes, who had been long governed by the laws of their own original country. This appearance of ju&s;tice and impartia|lity had great weight with the people, who looked upon them as happy omens

<P>Canute having &s;o far &s;ucceeded in his &s;cheme, re&s;olved to rid his hands of the two royal infants, believing, that while they lived he &s;hould never po&s;&s;e&s;s the throne in peace. He would not venture to take away their lives in England, though the traitor Edric would have gladly undertaken the ta&s;k, be|cau&s;e their death would have been naturally laid to his charge; and &s;uch a &s;u&s;|picion might have &s;apped the foundations of his government. He therefore, on pretence of &s;ending them to travel, committed them to the care of a tru&s;ty Dane, who had orders to take &s;ome effectual method to prevent them from re|turning to England.</P>

<P>This mini&s;ter, le&s;s barbarous than his ma&s;ter, compa&s;&s;ionating the &s;itu|ation of tho&s;e haple&s;s orphans, in&s;tead of carrying them to Denmark, according to the in&s;tructions he had received, conveyed them to the king of Sweden, whom he had made acquainted with Canute's intentions. That prince, what|ever abhorrence he conceived of this inhuman de&s;ign, was unwilling to incur the di&s;plea&s;ure of Canute, by entertaining them at his court; he therefore &s;ent them to Solomon, king of Hungary, from whom they met with a very ho&s;pi|table reception. Edwin died at this court, but Edward married the queen of Hungary's &s;i&s;ter Agatha, daughter of Henry II. emperor of Germany, by<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brompton.</NOTE> whom he had Edgar Athelin, and Margaret, afterwards queen of Scotland. There &s;till remained in England two &s;ons of Ethelred II. one legitimate, the other a ba&s;tard; though both were known by the name of Edwy. Even the&s;e Canute looked upon as ob&s;tacles to his intere&s;t, and bani&s;hed from the kingdom; the fir&s;t however he afterwards recalled, on pretence of be&s;towing upon him marks of his favour, and then found means to deprive him of his life.</P>

<P>But he could contrive no &s;cheme for the de&s;truction of Edmund's bro|thers, Alfred and Edward, who re&s;ided with their uncle Richard II. duke of Normandy, and might be one day enabled by that prince to a&s;&s;ert their title to the throne$ In order to avert that danger, he endeavoured to engage Richard in his intere&s;t, by demanding in marriage his &s;i&s;ter Emma, the mother of the young<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>Canute having taken the&s;e precautions, to e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf firmly on the throne of England, thought nothing was now wanting to render his authority ab|&s;olute, but the death of &s;ome noblemen, whom he dreaded for their power, or hated for their di&s;&s;affection. The principal of the&s;e were, the dukes of Mercia and Ea&s;t-Anglia, and the count of Northumberland He knew Edric Streon to be an infa|mous traitor, upon who&s;e fidelity he could not rely, and therefore doomed him as the fir&s;t victim to his own &s;ecurity. With re&s;pect to this wretch, his intere&s;t and equity in a very little time chanced to coincide; for, Edric was ra&s;h enough to tell him in public, that he had not been rewarded according to his &s;ervices; and in particular made a merit of having taken away the life of Edmund, in

<P>Immediately after this execution, a pretence was found for bani&s;hing Eric, count of Northumberland; and Turkil, duke of Ea&s;t-Anglia, fearing his turn would be the next, thought proper to anticipate his &s;ate by going into vo|luntary exile. Several other noblemen of le&s;s con&s;ideration were &s;acrificed to the king's jealou&s;y, and their offices filled with his own creatures; and now be|ing &s;ecure from all check or controul, he ventured to &s;addle the nation with a tax, for rai&s;ing eighty thou&s;and pounds, to pay off the arrears of the Dani&s;h ar|my, the greate&s;t part of which was &s;ent back to his own country. How&s;oever<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flor. Wig. Chron.

<P>Canute, having thus provided for the peace and &s;ecurity of the king|dom, re&s;olved to vi&s;it his own country, where his pre&s;ence was nece&s;&s;ary to pro|&s;ecute a war which had broke out between the Danes and the Vandals. He ac|cordingly &s;et &s;ail with a body of Engli&s;h troops, commanded by earl Goodwin, and accompanied by all the noblemen whom he thought the mo&s;t likely to rai&s;e di&s;turbances in his ab&s;ence. He arrived in Denmark at a very critical conjunc|ture, when the Vandals had actually penetrated into his country; and taking the field without delay, advanced in order to give them battle. But during the night that preceded the day fixed for the engagement, Goodwin, at the head of the Engli&s;h troops, charged the enemy with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that they were totally routed with great &s;laughter; and Canute in the morning found a victory before<NOTE PLACE="marg">Malme&s;b. An. Ch. 1020.</NOTE> he knew any thing of a battle. This exploit endeared the Engli&s;h to his affection, and rai&s;ed Goodwin to &s;uch a degree in his favour, that he gave him in marriage Thyra his own &s;i&s;ter-in-law, and maintained him in all the power and &s;plendour of the ducal dignity, at a time when he &s;trove to reduce in others that exorbitant authority which had been wre&s;ted from the crown in times of trouble and confu&s;ion. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Malme&s;b.

<P>This war being happily fini&s;hed, he returned to England, and hence|forth made no di&s;tinction between Dane and Saxon, in the di&s;tribution of his favours. Ju&s;tice was admini&s;tered with the utmo&s;t partiality, and the people enjoyed peace and affluence under his equal admini&s;tration. Yet, in order to re|commend him&s;elf &s;till more warmly to the affection of his Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, he built churches at all the places which were di&s;tingui&s;hed by the &s;laughter of the Saxons during his &s;truggle for the crown: he erected chantries, in which conti|nual prayers were &s;aid for the &s;ouls of the &s;lain, repaired &s;ome mona&s;teries which had &s;uffered by the Danes, and founded a new convent at Bury, in honour of St. Edmund, who had been murdered an hundred and fifty years before this period, by his ance&s;tors, and was highly reverenced all over England. He con|voked
<PB N="186" REF="1950">
the &s;tates at Winche&s;ter, where Thurketyl was outlawed for having been concerned in the murder of St. Alfage; and many other popular laws were enacted. Tho&s;e of Edward I. were tran&s;lated into Latin for the u&s;e of Den|mark; and Canute redoubled his indu&s;try in taking every &s;tep that could ren|der him agreeable to the Engli&s;h nation. About this period, under&s;tanding that Anlaf or Olave king of Norway was de&s;pi&s;ed and hated by his &s;ubjects, becau&s;e he re&s;trained them from the exerci&s;e of rapine, to which they had been &s;o long accu&s;tommed; he, in order to take advantage of their di&s;content, &s;ent over large fums of money to corrupt the noblemen, and rai&s;e a &s;trong party in his fa|vour: but before he could bring his project to bear, his own dominions in Denmark were invaded by the Swedes.

<P>As for Canute, notwith&s;tanding all the pains he had taken to e&s;tabli&s;h his authority, a con&s;piracy was formed again&s;t his life, by one Hacum, a Dani&s;h nobleman, who had married his niece; but it was happily di&s;covered, and the traitor &s;ent into bani&s;hment. This danger was &s;ucceeded by another, which had like to have been attended with very important con&s;equences. The dukedom of Nor|mandy having devolved to Robert, &s;on of Richard II. he re&s;olved to e&s;pou&s;e the in|tere&s;t of his cou&s;ins Alfred and Edward, the &s;ons of Ethelred, who &s;till re&s;ided in that country; and actually &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to demand of Canute the inheri|tance of tho&s;e princes. His emba&s;&s;y being di&s;regarded, he equipped a powerful fleet, in order to invade England; but his &s;hips were &s;o damaged and di&s;per&s;ed by a &s;torm, that the enterprize mi&s;carried; though he &s;till continued to make prepa|rations for a &s;econd trial. Canute being informed of his intention, and well acquainted with his great power, thought proper to temporize, and make pro|po&s;als of accommodation. He even offered to re&s;ign &s;ome part of We&s;&s;ex to the princes, during his own life; and found means to protract the negotiation, until Robert undertook a pilgrimage to Jeru&s;alem. The expedition to England was therefore po&s;toned 'till his return, which never happened, and his dukedom devolved to his ba&s;tard &s;on William, who afterwards mounted the Engli&s;h throne, under the name of the Conqueror.</P>

<P>The la&s;t military expedition he undertook, was again&s;t Malcolm II. king of Scotland, who while he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the county of Cumberland as heir appa|rent to the Scotti&s;h throne, had refu&s;ed to contribute towards the Danegelt rai&s;ed by Ethelred; and bravely replied, that he was ready to pay the enemy with &s;teel but not with &s;ilver. This an&s;wer incen&s;ed Ethelred to &s;uch a degree, that he employed again&s;t him the armament which had been prepared again&s;t the Danes, in wa&s;ting the country of Cumberland; but, that quarrel was compromi&s;ed. When the Danes over-ran England, Malcolm refu&s;ed to do homage or pay tribute to their kings, whom he con&s;idered as u&s;urpers; and he had defeated divers ar|mies of that kingdom, who had landed in Scotland, with their families, to make &s;ettlements in the country: at length a peace had been concluded between him and Canute, which was inviolably pre&s;erved by the Dane till &s;uch time as he found it convenient to forget the articles. Malcolm's grand&s;on Duncan, a prince of &s;lender abilities, was now prince of Cumberland, as heir apparent of the Scotti&s;h crown; and he refu&s;ing to pay homage to Canute, the Dani&s;h ki$g, after his pil|grimage to Rome, a&s;&s;embled an army, in order to reduce Cumberland by force of arms. Malcolm, in behalf of his grand&s;on, advanced with another to give him battle, and a furious engagement would have en&s;ued, had not the prelates and noblemen of both armies interpo&s;ed their mediation, and effected a peace; by which it was agreed, that Duncan from the time being, and all his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors princes of Scotland, &s;hould hold Cumberland according to the original tenour, and do homage for that fief to Canute and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors kings of England. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun.

<P>After this accommodation Canute met with nothing to di&s;turb his tranquillity. From his conque&s;ts he derived the &s;urname of Great; but, he merited that epithet much more by the virtues he manife&s;ted during the paci|fic period of his admini&s;tration. Though he had &s;hed an ocean of blood, and trampled under foot all laws divine and human, in making his way to the throne, he was no &s;ooner e&s;tabli&s;hed in the regal authority, than he &s;eemed to change his di&s;po&s;ition, and became con&s;picuous for his ju&s;tice, piety, and moderation, &s;o as to acquire the love of his &s;ubjects and the e&s;teem of mankind<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Huntingdon relates an in&s;tance of his beha|viour in private life, which a$gued his good &s;en&s;e and abhorrence of flattery.

<P>Canute, before his death, had e&s;tabli&s;hed his &s;on Hardicnute on the throne of Denmark, and given Norway to Swein; but, as he had not mentioned a &s;ucce&s;&s;or for the kingdom of England, a conte&s;t en&s;ued among his children, and the Engli&s;h prelates and nobility were divided into three parties. But the chief di&s;pute lay between the partizans of Harold and Hardi$nute; the fir&s;t was e&s;pou&s;ed by all the Danes &s;ettled in England, while the Engli&s;h declared for Hardicnute as the &s;on of Emma. The contention was carried on with &s;uch heat, that a civil war had well nigh been the con&s;equence: but, at la&s;t it was terminated by an agreement, importing that the country to<NOTE PLACE="marg">I$gu$$$.

Harold perceiving that this noble|man acted with unbounded authority and influence, as admini&s;trator of his bro|ther's kingdom, re&s;olved to bring him over to his intere&s;t; and &s;ucceeded in the attempt by means which are ea&s;ily conceived, when we know that Harold had &s;eized all his father's trea&s;ure.</P>

<P>Goodwin, being thus engaged in his cau&s;e, managed his talents for intrigue with &s;uch addre&s;s among the We&s;t Saxons, that they looked upon them|&s;elves as neglected by Hardicnute, and began to turn their eyes upon his bro|ther Harold. Emma, being informed of the&s;e tran&s;actions, and finding her&s;elf incapable of &s;upporting the intere&s;t of Hardicnute, had recour&s;e to di&s;&s;imula|tion, and affected to withdraw her&s;elf intirely from worldly affairs, vi&s;iting churches and mona&s;teries, and employing all her time in exerci&s;es of de|votion. By this conduct, &s;he thought &s;he had effectually lulled the &s;u&s;picion of Goodwin, who, though he &s;till governed the kingdom, in the name of Har|dicnute, employed all his arts in private to &s;trengthen the intere&s;t of Harold. Her de&s;ign was to bring over the &s;ons of Ethelred from Normandy, on pre|tence of a vi&s;it to their mother, in hope that the affection of the Engli&s;h would by their pre&s;ence be revived in favour of the race of Cerdic. When &s;he expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of &s;eeing her children, Goodwin immediately perceived her drift, and gladly con&s;ented to gratify her intention, with a view to recommend him&s;elf &s;till more &s;trongly to Harold by the murder of tho&s;e princes. Emma, who little dreamed of any &s;uch inhuman de&s;ign, wrote a letter of invitation to her &s;ons, whom &s;he encouraged with the hope of recovering their inheritance; and they accordingly arrived with a train of a thou&s;and Normans.</P>

<P>The hearts of the Engli&s;h were warmed by the appearance of tho&s;e princes, de&s;cended from their own glorious monarchs, who&s;e memory they held in the utmo&s;t veneration; and they received them with &s;uch cordiality as alarmed the traitor Goodwin, who therefore ha&s;tened the execution of his treacherous de&s;ign. He had &s;eemingly been the mo&s;t eager of all the noblemen in doing honour to the &s;ons of Emma; but that prince&s;s, who&s;e maternal fondne&s;s rendered her wary and circum&s;pect, never allowed them to vi&s;it together, but &s;till retained

the one under her own eye, while the other was entertained by the noblemen in the country. Goodwin, finding it impracticable to entangle them both at once in his &s;nare, re&s;olved to perpetrate his trea&s;on upon Alfred the elde&s;t, whom he arre&s;ted with all his followers in the ca&s;tle of Guilford, by virtue of Ha|rold's order. Upon this occa&s;ion he is &s;aid to have tampered with the prince, by offering him his intere&s;t, on condition he would marry his daughter; and that Alfred having rejected the propo&s;al with &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of di&s;dain, he was &s;o in|cen&s;ed at the affrent, that he ordered the unhappy prince's eyes to be put out, and ma&s;&s;acred &s;ix hundred Normans, by whom he was attended. He then conveyed him to Ely, where he was confined to a mona&s;tery, in which he langui&s;hed for &s;ome time in mi&s;ery and pain, and then expired. Edward being apprized of his<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brompton.</NOTE> brother's fate, was by the care of his mother &s;ent privately back to Normandy; and Goodwin finding him&s;elf hampered in the execution of his &s;chemes, by the pre&s;ence of this ambitious and intriguing prince&s;s, found means to impeach and convict her of trea&s;onable practices again&s;t the &s;tate; &s;o that &s;he was bani&s;hed from the kingdom, and took refuge with Baldwin earl of Flanders, who gene|rou&s;ly a&s;&s;igned the city of Bruges for her abode and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>

<P>Goodwin, being now ab&s;olute ma&s;ter in the kingdom of We&s;&s;ex, and Hardicnute &s;till delaying his departure from Denmark, that infamous mi|ni&s;ter &s;urrendered his power into the hands of Harold, who was proclaimed and crowned king of all England. This prince, who was &s;urnamed Harefoot from his agility, no &s;ooner mounted the throne than he laid a tax upon the peo|ple for the equipment of a navy to prevent inva&s;ions; and in all probability this impo&s;ition would not have produced &s;o much di&s;content, had it not been in|tended to prevent the &s;ucce&s;s of Edward, whom the Engli&s;h con&s;idered as the true heir to the crown. Not but that the &s;on of Edmund re&s;iding in Hungary had the advantage over him in proximity of blood, yet he was at too great a di&s;tance to have any corre&s;pondence or party in the kingdom; and indeed the Engli&s;h would have elected any prince of the mo&s;t &s;lender preten&s;ions, rather than be governed by Harold, who&s;e brutal character they dete&s;ted, and who&s;e authority was founded intirely on the intere&s;t of Goodwin and his a&s;&s;ociates. Normandy was too much divided during the minority of William to afford any con&s;iderable &s;uccours to Edward, who&s;e genius was by no means enterprizing; and therefore the Engli&s;h had recour&s;e to Hardicnute, their countryman by birth, whom they conjured to come and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne, promi&s;ing to &s;upport his claim with their lives and fortunes. That prince &s;eemed at length to wake from his lethargy, and fitting out a fleet of &s;ixty &s;hips, &s;et &s;ail on pre|tence of vi&s;iting his mother at Bruges, where while he re&s;ided, he was ble&s;&s;ed with the news of Harold's death. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Angl.

<P>The Danes as well as Engli&s;h unanimou&s;ly joined in making a tender of the crown to Hardicnute, who, at his arrival in England, was re|ceived with the mo&s;t extravagant demon&s;trations of joy, and earl Goodwin di&s;|tingui&s;hed him&s;elf as the fir&s;t nobleman who did him homage. The ceremony of his coronation was &s;carce performed, when, impatient to give his mother a con|vincing proof of the dete&s;tation in which he held his brother Harold, by who&s;e order her &s;on Alfred had been de&s;troyed, he ordered the body of the decea&s;ed king to be dug up, decapitated, and thrown into the Thames, where it was found by &s;ome fi&s;hermen, and privately interred in the church-yard of St. Clements,
<PB N="190" REF="1990">
which was the Dani&s;h burying-ground. Hardicnute's next act of &s;overeignty was the impo&s;ition of a grievous tax for the payment of his navy, which was the more intolerable as the nation was threatened with a famine. This mea&s;ure pro|duced univer&s;al murmurs through the whole kingdom; and the inhabitants of Worce&s;ter rai&s;ed an in&s;urrection, in which two of the collectors lo&s;t their lives. The king, being informed of this outrage, ordered Goodwin duke of We&s;&s;ex, Leoffric duke of Mercia, and Siward count of Northumberland, to a&s;&s;emble a body of forces, and revenge the in&s;ult, by de&s;troying the town, and extermi|nating<NOTE PLACE="marg">S$m.

The&s;e were marks of a cruel di&s;po&s;ition; though it mu&s;t be owned that Hardicnute was a pious &s;on and an affectionate brother to Edward, whom he invited to his court, and entertained with the mo&s;t cordial ho&s;pitality. It was al&s;o at this juncture that he celebrated the nuptials of his &s;i&s;ter and Henry III. emperor of Germany, with incredible magnificence; though that lady found her&s;elf extremely unhappy, from the jealou&s;y of her hu&s;band, and afterwards obtained a divorce.</P>

<P>By this time the Norman intere&s;t triumphed at the Engli&s;h court, in the pre&s;ence of Edward and the intere&s;t of Emma, who had not yet for|got the tragical death of her elde&s;t &s;on. It was doubtle&s;s with a view to gratify her re&s;entment, and pay court to Edward, who would in all proba|bility one day mount the throne, that Alfric archbi&s;hop of York accu&s;ed Good|win of being an accomplice in the murder of prince Alfred; and Edward de|manded ju&s;tice accordingly. Goodwin found means to evade the danger of this impeachment, by appealing to the avarice of the king, whom he pre&s;ented with a magnificent galley curiou&s;ly carved and gilded, and manned with eighty &s;ol|diers ca&s;ed in rich armour, with magnificent &s;words and lances, and each of them a golden bracelet, weighing &s;ixteen ounces, on his arm. By virtue of this pre&s;ent, he was permitted to purge him&s;elf by oath, and readily &s;wore he had no<NOTE PLACE="marg">S$m. Dunelm.</NOTE> hand in the death of Alfred.</P>
<P>Hardicnute did not long enjoy the crown, which indeed he was unworthy to wear.

<P>Edward, who chanced to be in England at the time of Hardicnute's death, was advi&s;ed by his friends to have recour&s;e to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Goodwin, who alone was able to &s;upport or defeat his preten&s;ions. By this time indeed, Goodwin had engro&s;&s;ed &s;uch power and influence in the kingdom, as no &s;ub|ject had ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Be&s;ides the dignities of duke of We&s;&s;ex, earl of Kent, and high trea&s;urer, ve&s;ted in his own per&s;on, his elde&s;t &s;on enjoyed the govern|ments of Oxford&s;hire and Hereford&s;hire; and his great wealth, intere&s;t, and al|liances, had rendered him more than a match for any faction that could be rai&s;ed to oppo&s;e his de&s;igns. It was therefore a &s;alutary advice, in pur&s;uance of which, Edward, who a few months before had pro&s;ecuted him for the murder of his brother, now &s;ollicited his intere&s;t in the mo&s;t humble &s;upplications, and promi&s;ed to be entirely ruled by his directions. Upon the&s;e terms Goodwin espou&s;ed his cau&s;e; and after having obtained his promi&s;e that he would marry
<PB N="191" REF="2000">
his daughter Egitha, employed his intere&s;t &s;o effectually in his behalf, that he<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1043.</NOTE> was proclaimed king of England, and crowned by Ed&s;i, archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury. What facilitated this event, was the national hatred between the Engli&s;h<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flor. Wig. Hoveden.</NOTE> and Danes, which at this time was increa&s;ed to an implacable degree of rancour, by the in&s;olence of Hardicnute's followers, who had committed &s;uch outrages of all &s;orts, that the people were no &s;ooner appri&s;ed of the king's death, than they took to their arms, and butchered or expelled all the Danes who had ac|companied him to England. Goodwin &s;eized this favourable opportunity of con|voking an a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates, in which with an eloquence peculiar to him&s;elf, he expatiated upon the mi&s;eries which that people had entailed upon the nation; and when their minds were properly warmed, he pre&s;ented Edward, as a de&s;cen|dant of their antient kings, who&s;e claim would be &s;upported by the whole power of Normandy. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gul.

<P>His remon&s;trances had the de&s;ired effect, and united all the &s;uffrages in favour of Edward, surnamed the Confe&s;&s;or, a prince of very mean parts, who had neither capacity to rule, nor re&s;olution to maintain his authority. His con|tinual attachment to trifles, his want of di&s;cernment, and timorous di&s;po&s;ition, enabled his officers and dome&s;tics to impo&s;e upon his weakne&s;s, and encouraged the governors of provinces to render them&s;elves ab&s;olute and independent. Earl Goodwin in particular, gradually u&s;urped &s;uch a &s;hare of power and autho|rity, that he was more con&s;idered than the king him&s;elf; and no doubt, the narrowne&s;s of the king's genius was one of the concurring motives which in|duced him to &s;upport his claim; becau&s;e he knew his own credit would ri&s;e in proportion to the incapacity of Edward, under who&s;e name he accordingly ma|naged the whole kingdom. Not but that he hated Goodwin in his heart, both as the murderer of his brother, and the controuler of his own authority; and this doubtle&s;s was the cau&s;e of his aver&s;ion to the accompli&s;hed Egitha, whom he delayed to wed, under various pretences, until he dur&s;t no longer defer the performance of his promi&s;e, le&s;t he &s;hould incur the re&s;entment of her father; and even after the nuptials were &s;olemnized, he never con&s;ummated the mar|riage. As he had not courage enough to avow his &s;entiments, he affected to<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. Malme&s;b.</NOTE> heap favours on his father-in-law; and this impolitic di&s;&s;imulation increa&s;ed the power and credit of Goodwin, by convincing the people that he was beloved by his &s;overeign.</P>

<P>Edward, notwith&s;tanding his titles of Saint and Confe&s;&s;or, which he acquired by his attention to the formalities of religion, was a &s;tranger to the chri&s;tian virtues of charity and forgivene&s;s, as well as to that natural affection which u&s;ually &s;prings from the ties of blood. He had entertained a grudge again&s;t his mother, &s;ince the day &s;he e&s;pou&s;ed her &s;econd hu&s;band; and all the efforts &s;he made in the &s;equel to rai&s;e him to the throne, and &s;creen him from the practices of his enemies, had not been able to de&s;troy the impre&s;&s;ion, or even conquer his de&s;i$e of revenge, which he now re&s;olved to gratify. With|out paying the lea&s;t regard to her quality he repaired to Winche&s;ter, where &s;he re&s;ided, and, &s;tripping her of all her trea&s;ures and effects, left her nothing but a very moderate pen&s;ion for her &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; &s;o that, in her old age, this daughter of a prince, and widow of two great kings, was reduced to extreme poverty, by the cruelty of her own &s;on.

for having carried on a &s;candalous commerce with Alwin, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;|ter.

<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e laudable avocations, Edward was alarmed with an account of mighty preparations making by Swein, king of Norway and Denmark, to a&s;&s;ert his title to the crown of England, in right of his father Canute. The country was immediately put in a po&s;ture of defence, by the care of earl Goodwin, a&s;&s;i&s;ted with the endeavours of Leoffric, duke of Mercia, and Siward, earl of Northumberland; and Gunilda, niece of Canute the Great, was obliged to abandon her family and leave the kingdom, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould hatch &s;ome con&s;piracy in favour of her countrymen. But, this cloud was di&s;pelled by a war that broke out between Swein and Magnus, &s;on of Anlaf, late king of Norway; in con&s;equence of which rupture Swein's armament was otherwi&s;e<NOTE PLACE="marg">$. m. Dunelm.</NOTE> employed. Magnus not only recovered the crown of his father, now known by the name of St. Olave, but afterwards invaded Denmark; &s;o that Swein was fain to &s;ollicit the king of England for &s;uccour. Goodwin advi&s;ed Ed|ward to &s;end fifty &s;hips to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but this propo&s;al was &s;o warmly oppo&s;ed in council by Leoffric and Siward, that no &s;tep was taken in favour of Swein, who was driven from his kingdom, though he recovered his throne after the death of his enemy. The troubles of Denmark, however, did not hinder the pyrates of that country from infe&s;ting the Engli&s;h coa&s;ts. A body of the&s;e adventurers arrived at Sandwich, in five and twenty ve&s;&s;els, and ravaged the country, from whence they not only carried off the plunder, which they found, but even the people them&s;elves, whom they &s;old as &s;laves in foreign markets. They after|wards crui&s;ed upon the coa&s;t of E&s;&s;ex, pillaging the country, and &s;preading ter|ror and con&s;ternation where&s;oever they moved, until earl Goodwin, and the other two noblemen above-mentioned, a&s;&s;embled a body of forces, and repul&s;ed<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. $h 1046.</NOTE> them to their &s;hips with great con&s;ternation.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="24" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXIV.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e enemies had no &s;ooner di&s;appeared, than another adventurer alarmed the coa&s;t. This was no other than Goodwin's &s;on Swein, who had been obliged to leave the kingdom for having carried off an abbe&s;s, of whom he was enamoured. He had retired to Denmark, in full confidence of obtaining his pardon, through the interce&s;&s;ion of his father; but whether Good|win was willing that his &s;on &s;hould &s;uffer for the offence he had committed, or the king was inexorable with regard to an outrage offered to religion, the young count found him&s;elf di&s;appointed in his expectation; and re&s;olved to be reveng|ed on his country for the inflexibility of the king. With this view he equip|ed eight ve&s;&s;els, and committed depredations on the Engli&s;h merchants and the coa&s;ts of the kingdom, which he plundered and burned without mercy. Good|win fearing that the&s;e violences might incen&s;e the king again&s;t him and his fa|mily, and furni&s;h a handle to his enemies, prevailed upon count Beorn, &s;on of Ulphon, by E&s;tritha, &s;i&s;ter to Canute the Great, to employ his good offices with Edward, in favour of his rebellious &s;on; and that nobleman obtained his pardon, upon certain conditions. Then he repaired to Swein, in order to make him acquainted with the &s;ucce&s;s of his negociation, and per&s;uade him to &s;ubmit
<PB N="193" REF="2020">
to the king's plea&s;ure; when that brutal pyrate, &s;uppo&s;ing the count's intention was to betray him into the hands of ju&s;tice, &s;lew his benefactor with his own hand, and ordered his body to be thrown into the &s;ea. This barbarous murder retarded the accommodation; but the king afterwards pardoned this ruffian, not|with&s;tanding the complication of his crimes; &s;o much was he afraid of incurring the di&s;plea&s;ure of Goodwin. Indeed there was another rea&s;on which concurred with this motive for taking off the outlawry of Swein at this juncture: another fleet of Dani&s;h freebooters had arrived on the coa&s;t, and were actually joined by the traitor's &s;quadron; which reinforcement rendered them &s;o formidable to England, that it was no wonder Edward u&s;ed this expedient for weakening their power. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rog. de Hov.</NOTE></P>

<P>No part of Edward's conduct gave more offence to the Engli&s;h no|blemen, than his partiality in favour of the natives and cu&s;toms of Normandy, where he had been educated. The Norman language became &s;o fa&s;hionable at his court, that it was &s;poke by every per&s;on who &s;tudied to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into the king's good graces.

A &s;ervant, whom he had di&s;patched before him to be&s;peak lodgings in that city, happened to quarrel with the town&s;men, and a fray en&s;ued, in which he lo&s;t his life.

The count, exa&s;perated at this in&s;ult, returned to the court at Glouce&s;ter, and demanded ju&s;tice of the king, who forthwith ordered Goodwin, in who&s;e government the tumult had happened, to march with a body of troops, and cha&s;ti&s;e the offenders with fire and &s;word.</P>

<P>The earl, thinking he had now found an opportunity of recom|mending him&s;elf to the Engli&s;h nation, and of being revenged on the Norman archbi&s;hop at the &s;ame time, flatly refu&s;ed to obey the king's command; ob|&s;erving that the Engli&s;h &s;ubjects were not u&s;ed to be condemned unheard; and that the equitable way of terminating this affair would be a legal trial, in con|&s;equence of which the guilty might be puni&s;hed by law: that, as earl of Kent, it

was his duty to protect the people whom he was ordered to puni&s;h; and that the re&s;i&s;tance they had made was in their own defence, again&s;t an in&s;olent fo|reigner, who ought to be &s;urrendered to ju&s;tice, and &s;uffer for the mi&s;chief he had done. Edward, though &s;hocked at this audacious remon&s;trance, di&s;&s;embled his wrath, becau&s;e he wanted the &s;inews of vengeance: the archbi&s;hop and his Norman friends did not fail to blow the flame of his re&s;entment; but they were in no condition to &s;upport him again&s;t the power and intere&s;t of Goodwin, &s;hould he come to an open rupture with that nobleman. He therefore di&s;patch|ed em$&s;&s;aries, in whom he could confide, to duke Leoffric and count Siward, to inform them of Goodwin's in&s;olence, and de&s;ire their immediate pre&s;ence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to humble the pride and pre&s;umption of that dangerous &s;ubject, who dared to brave the royal authority.</P>

<P>This &s;tep was not taken &s;o &s;ecretly, but that it reached the ears of Goodwin, who re&s;olved to be beforehand with the king; and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his &s;ons rai&s;ed a &s;trong body of forces, on pretence of marching again&s;t the Wel&s;h, who had erected a petty fort on the frontiers of Hereford&s;hire.

Edward, by this time, back|ed by the Mercian and Northumbrian forces, made a &s;uitable reply to this trea|&s;onable declaration; and a civil war mu&s;t have been the con&s;equence, had not Siward and Leoffric prevented matters from being brought to extremity, and &s;et on foot a negociation, by which it was agreed that the di&s;putes &s;hould be ju|dicially determined before the a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates at London. Mean while Ed|ward's army was reinforced from different quarters by all the nobility who hated Goodwin; and at the appointed time the earl's two &s;ons marched to Southwark with a numerous body of We&s;t-Saxons; but their men de&s;erting continually, they retired before the determination of their cau&s;e, and Goodwin and his five &s;ons were condemned to bani&s;hment.</P>

Goodwin and his &s;ons did not tamely bear their exile and di&s;grace; but finding means to equip a good number of &s;hips at Bruges as well as in Ireland, their &s;quadrons joined near Portland, and, &s;ailing along &s;hore, were reinforced all the way by &s;oldiers from the country, and &s;hips from the Cinque-ports, until entering the Thames, they advanced to London, where the king was provided with a &s;trong fleet and army for their reception.</P>

<P>The tranquillity of England being re&s;tored by this reconciliation, the king was vi&s;ited by William the Ba&s;tard, duke of Normandy; during who&s;e re&s;idence at the Engli&s;h court, Edward took all opportunities of manife&s;ting his gratitude for the favours and protection he owed to that prince in his adver&s;ity.

<P>Goodwin's power increa&s;ed every day to &s;uch a degree that his arro|gance became quite in&s;upportable, and the more grievous to Edward, as he had found means to bani&s;h from court every per&s;on in whom that weak prince repo&s;ed the lea&s;t confidence. This tyranny however at la&s;t expired with the life of that im|perious nobleman, who was &s;uddenly deprived of the faculty of &s;peech as he &s;at at dinner with the king at the palace of Oldiham, and being carried into an apartment of the palace, died in three days, during which he continued &s;peechle&s;s and in&s;en|&s;ible. This was probably no other than an apoplectic fit, the effect of age and infir|mity;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flor. Wig.</NOTE> tho' the monki&s;h writers imputed it to the judgment of heaven, affirming that the king having dropped &s;ome hint of &s;u&s;picion again&s;t the earl as an ac|complice in the murder of Alfred, Goodwin exclaimed, "May this mor&s;el be<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$.

<P>Timorous as this prince was in his di&s;po&s;ition, he found him|&s;elf &s;o far happy, that his dominions were not expo&s;ed to the calamities of war, though he was not a little alarmed about this period, by Macbeth, u&s;urper of the Scoti&s;h crown, who threatened to invade Cumberland. That bloody tyrant had murdered his lawful king Duncan, who had loaded him with favours, and now wanted to de&s;troy that prince's &s;on Malcolm Canmore, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Cumber|land, as elde&s;t &s;on and he$r apparent of the king of Scotland. Macbeth having rendered him&s;elf odious to his &s;ubjects by his cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion, the greate&s;t part of the nobility &s;ollicited Malcolm in &s;ecret, to mar$$ again&s;t the u&s;urper, and promi&s;ed to declare for him as &s;oon as he &s;hould cro&s;s the borders of the kingdom. This young prince had recour&s;e to Edward, who &s;upplied him with a &s;trong body of forces, commanded by Siward earl of Northumberland; and they advanced again&s;t the u&s;$rper, who gave them battle, and was defeated after a very de&s;perate engagement, in which O&s;born the &s;on of Siward lo&s;t his life. When the count under&s;tood that he was &s;lain, he a&s;ked if his wounds were before, and being an&s;wered in the affirmative, "Well then (&s;aid he) I can give him a &s;oldier's burial."

<P>His government was be&s;towed upon Harold's brother To&s;ton, by which the family of Goodwin gained a great acce&s;&s;ion of power; though Harold, not yet &s;atisfied with his good fortune, projected the ruin of his own brother-in-law Alfgar, becau&s;e he re&s;ented the king's conferring upon that no|blemen the offices which he had formerly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.

<P>Whether this nobleman was de&s;irous of engaging William duke of Normandy in his intere&s;t, not knowing the private agreement between king Edward and that duke; or he wanted to effect the relea&s;e of his brother Ulnoth and his nephew Hacun, who had been delivered as ho&s;tages for his father's good behaviour, and &s;ent into Normandy, where they &s;till re&s;ided; he re&s;olved to make a voyage to the continent, and a&s;ked the king's permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ollicit the duke in per&s;on for the liberty of his relations, whom, as Edward pretended, he had refu&s;ed to relea&s;e. The king, though ince&s;&s;antly importuned on this &s;ub|ject, lent a deaf ear to his intreaties, becau&s;e he was afraid that Harold would in a per&s;onal interview with William, di&s;cover the agreement he had made with that prince, relating to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and embroil him with his own &s;ubjects at his return. Harold, finding the king inflexible, re&s;olved to take that liberty which Edward would not grant, and embarked for Rouen, without giving the king the lea&s;t intimation of his de&s;ign; but he was driven by &s;tre&s;s of weather into one of the ports of Picardy, and immediately arre&s;ted by order of the count de Ponthieu. In this emergency he wrote an account of his misfortunes to Wil|liam duke of Normandy, who demanded him from the count in &s;uch a peremp|tory manner, that he was &s;et at liberty, and proceeded to Rouen, where he was received with great ho&s;pitality; tho' the duke re&s;olved to make his advantage of this vi&s;it. He took occa&s;ion to communicate to Harold his de&s;igns upon the crown of England, and the &s;ecret contract between Edward and him upon that &s;ubject; and as he was not ignorant of Harold's views, gave him to under&s;tand that he expected he would re&s;ign his preten&s;ions. The earl, who had never &s;u&s;pected any &s;uch collu&s;ion between the king and the duke, finding him&s;elf in the power of the latter, thought proper to di&s;&s;emble his &s;entiments; and after having owned with an appearance of candour, that he had once entertained &s;uch views before the arrival of prince Edward from Hungary, now faithfully promi&s;ed to contribute h$s whole intere&s;t in behalf of William, who&s;e daughter he demanded in mar|riage,

<P>He no &s;ooner returned to England, however, than he forgot his oath, and redoubled his endeavours to baffle the de&s;igns of William, by taking all opportunities of increa&s;ing the national prejudice again&s;t the Normans; of &s;trengthening his own party among the nobles; and of recommending him|&s;elf more and more to the favour and affection of the people: while Edward, who plainly perceived his aim, took no pa$ns to counteract his projects, having<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ Dun $span$</NOTE> no connexions that he valued above his own peace and tranquillity, which he determined if po&s;&s;ible to pre&s;erve.</P>

Harold, &s;eeing no end to the&s;e depredations, but in the de&s;truction of the whole race, marched again&s;t them with a body of light-armed troops, which pur&s;ued them among their hills and ferretted them out of their retreats, while his cavalry &s;coured the plain country; &s;o that the enemy finding them&s;elves in danger of being utterly exterminated, &s;lew their gallant prince Griffith, and &s;ent his head to Harold, as a token of their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion: upon which they were forgiven, and acknowledged the authority of Blethyh and Raywallon, whom Ed|ward<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fl$r W$g$$n Sim.

Convinced of To&s;ton$s brutality, he &s;acrificed his affection to his duty, and not only repre&s;ented the affair in its true colours to the king, but effected the confirmation of Morcard &s;on to Alfgar duke of Mercia, whom the Northum|brians had elected for their governor. Mean wh$le To&s;ton retired in wrath<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ Wig $word$ Sax.</NOTE> to Flan$ers; after having committed an action which proves him to have been a mon&s;ter of barbarity.

<P>While Harold, in t$is manner, took long &s;trides towards the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, Edward's attention was engro&s;&s;ed by the dedication of the cathedral at We&s;tmin&s;ter, which, together with an adjoining mona&s;tery, he built in the place where an old church had &s;tood, that was founded by king Sabert, or ra|ther converted into a Chri&s;tian church, from a temple in which the old Saxons had wor&s;hipped Apollo.

He had made a vow to go on a pilgrimage to Rome; but as he afterwards found it inconvenient as well as di&s;agreeable to his &s;ubjects to leave the kingdom, he obtained a di&s;pen&s;ation from the pope, ab&s;olving him from this obligation; but he thought he could not employ the money he had rai&s;ed for his journey to a better purpo&s;e than that of building the cathedral and mona&s;tery of We&s;tmin&s;ter, to which he granted, by charter, the privilege of a &s;anctuary and other valuable exemptions, which were confirmed by the a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates; and the church was con&s;ecrated to St. Peter.

<P>Thus died Edward, who&s;e mental qualities did not at all an&s;wer to the dignity of his per&s;on. He was weak, indolent, and irre&s;olute, and the attach|ment to his own ea&s;e tended in a great mea&s;ure to the tranquillity of his reign; for had he been active in his re&s;entment, the nation mu&s;t have been expo&s;ed to the calamities of a civil war, from the mea&s;ures he would have taken to gratify his hatred towards Goodwin and his family. He &s;eems to have been void of natural af|fection, and indeed of every other pa&s;&s;ion that kindles any warm emotion in the human heart. He was equally free of pride and o&s;tentation, moderate in his appe|tites, complacent in his deportment, charitable to the poor, and extremely punc|tu$l in the performance of all religious duties: &s;o that he acquired among the vul|gar the title of Saint and Confe&s;&s;or, by which epithet he was afterwards canonized. His continence, &s;o much extolled by the monki&s;h writers, &s;eems to have been the effect of con&s;titutional frigidity. His prophecies and revelations are no other than the dreams of &s;uper&s;tition; and as for his curing &s;crophulous tumours and ulcers by the touch, the &s;en&s;ible part of mankind is by this time very well convinced that neither he who exerci&s;ed this apo&s;tolical function, in imitation of the French kings, nor any of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, ever contributed to the recovery of one patient, by any inherent per&s;onal virtue derived from heaven. The pa&s;&s;ive humanity, or rather ea&s;ine&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition, appears from &s;ome private incidents

of his life, which are very often more characteri&s;tic, than tho&s;e tran&s;actions of importance, which are the effects of coun&s;el and deliberation. One day, while he repo&s;ed him&s;elf upon a couch, a page who little dreamed that he was in the apartment, finding an iron che&s;t open, filled his pockets with the &s;ilver it con|tained; but, not &s;atisfied with his fir&s;t booty, he had recour$e to it again, when the king thinking him perhaps too uncon&s;cionable, "Boy $&s;aid he very deli|berately) you had better be &s;atisfied with what you have got; for if Hugolin, my chamberlain, &s;hould come in, you will lo&s;e the whole, and be &s;everely whipt into the bargain." Another day being at the chace, in which he delighted, a forward pea&s;ant cro&s;&s;ed the hounds and &s;poiled his diver&s;ion; upon which he rode up to the clown in a great pa&s;&s;ion, exclaiming, "By God's mother! fellow, I would be revenged on thee, were it in my power." Before the reign of Edward, the<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ $word$ li$$ed.</NOTE> countries of We&s;&s;ex, Mercia, and Northumberland, were governed by their own peculiar laws; but he reduced them all into one body, and ordained they &s;hould be ob&s;erved in common through the whole kingdom.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ Ch. 10$6</NOTE> Harold had taken his precautions with &s;uch dexterity, that Edward's death was no &s;ooner known, than the &s;tates, already a&s;&s;embled, unanimou&s;ly elected him for their &s;overeign, without paying the lea&s;t regard to Edgar Athel|ing, the heir of blood, or to William, duke of Normandy, who&s;e preten&s;ions they did not &s;eem to know, as they were not publicly declared. There is great di&s;agreement among the authors who have writ the hi&s;tory of this period, touching the manner in which Harold a&s;cended the throne. Some alledge that the citizens of London, with Harold at their head, vi&s;ited Edward in his la&s;t moments, and extorted his nomination of this earl, even after he declared that he had already appointed William, duke of Normandy, for his &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and others affirm, that after Edward's death, finding there was a di&s;pute among the nobles about the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, he &s;eized the crown, which he placed upon his own head, and intimi$ated the a&s;&s;embly to &s;uch a degree, that they gave their &s;uffrages unanimou&s;ly in his favour.</P>

<P>Harold, being crowned, began his reign with many popular acts of government. He paid great de$erence to the clergy, without &s;hutting his eyes to the irregularities of that order, &s;everely cha&s;ti&s;ing the guilty, while he be&s;towed marks of his favour upon the innocent, by confirming their charters, and extending their immunities. He took the mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures for an impartial admini&s;tration of j$&s;tice: ordered the laws to be revi&s;ed and reformed, and exemplary puni&s;hment to be inflicted on robbers and di&s;turbers of the pub|lic peace, who had thriven under the lenity of the late reign; and la&s;tly, he made preparations for defending his territories from inva&s;ion and in&s;ult.</P>
<P>He created Edgar Atheling, earl of Oxford, cultivated the old nobility with kindne&s;s and veneration, ea&s;ed the people of their taxes, and took &s;uch pains to &s;ecure their property by whole&s;ome regulations, that there was no danger of his authority's being &s;haken by dome&s;tic troubles.</P>
<P>The&s;e precautions were the more nece&s;&s;ary, as he was not only threatened with a de&s;cent by William duke of Normandy, but likewi&s;e expo&s;ed to the machina|tions of his own brother To&s;t$n, who re&s;olved to di&s;turb his enjoyment of the new dignity he had acquired.

<P>The duke of Normandy, though well informed of all the&s;e po|pular tran&s;actions of Harold, would not de&s;i&s;t from the enterprize he had pro|jected, but carried on his preparations with unremitting vigour, and in the mean time, to give &s;ome colour of ju&s;tice to his attempt, he &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to demand that Harold would relinqui&s;h the crown in his favour, and to denounce war in ca&s;e of a refu&s;al. To this peremptory demand Harold replied, that William had no &s;ort of right to the crown of England; for, granting that the late king had di&s;po&s;ed of it in his favour, &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition (if any &s;uch there was) could not take place, ina&s;much as it was diametrically oppo&s;ite to the laws of the kingdom, which re&s;tricted kings from be&s;towing their crowns according to their own caprice, e&s;pecially to &s;trangers. With re&s;pect to him&s;elf, he had been fairly elected by tho&s;e who had a right to confer the &s;overeignty; nor could he yield the crown to any other, without betraying the confidence repo&s;ed in him by his &s;ubjects. As to the oath, which he accu&s;ed him of having vio|lated, it was extorted from him by compul&s;ion, while he was in the power of $he duke; and therefore null and void, according to the law of nations. Finally, he gave him to under&s;tand, that he knew how to defend his right again&s;t any per&s;on by whom he &s;hould be invaded.

<P>Duke William, in order to rai&s;e the &s;ums nece&s;&s;ary for defraying the expence of &s;uch an important enterprize, convoked an a&s;&s;embly of the Norman &s;tates, of whom he demanded &s;ub&s;idies. But they flatly refu&s;ed to comply with his propo&s;als, on pretence that Normandy was already exhau&s;ted of men and money by the late wars; and that they were not obliged to &s;erve in fo|reign expeditions, in which the intere&s;t of Normandy was not immediately con|cerned. William, di&s;appointed in this quarter, was advi&s;ed to borrow money of particular per&s;ons; and this method &s;ucceeded beyond his wi&s;h. The indivi|duals among the noblemen and merchants &s;eemed to vye with each other in con|tributing towards the armament; and among others, William Fitzo&s;berne un|dertook to equip forty ve&s;&s;els at his own expence. At the &s;ame time he had re|cour&s;e to &s;ome of the neighbouring princes, who advanced money on the con|tingency of having lands a&s;&s;igned to them, at the conque&s;t of England; and in order to give the greater &s;anction to his undertaking, he obtained the approba|tion of the pop$, by promi&s;ing to hold the kingdom as a fief of the holy &s;ee. That pontiff not only provided him with a con&s;ecrated &s;tandard; but al&s;o i&s;&s;ued a bull, excommunicating all tho&s;e who &s;hould attempt to interrupt the duke in the execution of his de&s;ign.

<P>It was at this juncture that the politic Norman engaged the king of Norway to make a diver&s;ion in his favour, by invading the north of England. Accordingly Harfager arrived with a fleet of two hundred &s;ail at the mouth of the Humber, where he was reinforced by To&s;ton, and &s;ailing up the river$ they land$d and l$id wa&s;te the country of York&s;hire. The earls of Mercia and Northumberland a&s;&s;embled a body of raw undi&s;ciplined troops to oppo&s;e their progre&s;s; but they were routed at Fulford, and York fell a prey to the enemy! Mean while Harold being appri&s;ed of Harfager's de&s;cent, began his march at the head of a royal army to check the career of the invaders; and the two ar|mies meeting near Standford bridge, &s;ince known by the name of Battle-bridge, a furious engagement en&s;ued, in which Harfager and To&s;ton were killed, and almo&s;t all their forces cut in pieces. Tho&s;e who e&s;caped, owed their &s;afety to the per&s;onal prowe&s;s of a brave Norwegian, who &s;ingly defended a bridge over the Derwent, for three hours, again&s;t the whole Engli&s;h army, during which time he &s;lew forty of their be&s;t men with his battle ax, until he was &s;lain by an arrow. Harold pur&s;uing his victory, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of a great many<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>The fame of this victory did not contribute &s;o much to the confidence which his &s;ubjects repo&s;ed in his valour and capacity, as his un&s;ea&s;onable par&s;imony hurt him in the opinion of his army: for he re&s;erved to him&s;elf the whole booty, which was very con&s;iderable, with a view to convert it to the maintenance of the war again&s;t the Norman: and though this was a laudable de&s;ign, formed in fa|vour of his &s;ubjects, whom he was loth to burthen, it produced great di&s;&s;atisfac|tion among his troops, a great number of whom de&s;erted the &s;ervice.</P>

After having refre&s;hed his men at this place, he advanced along the &s;ea-&s;ide to Ha$tings, where he ordered a fort to be built, and publi&s;hed a manife&s;to, containing the motives that induced him to under|take the enterprize.

<P>Harold was at York when he received the news of this inva&s;ion$ and forthwith began his march for London, where, upon reviewing his army, he found it very much dimini&s;hed by the battle with the Norwegians, and the &s;ub|&s;equent de&s;ertion: but, all the nobility had a&s;&s;embled about his per&s;on, to of|fer their &s;ervices on &s;uch an intere&s;ting occa&s;ion. While he remained in this city, waiting for &s;ome troops that were on the march to join him from diffe|rent parts of the country, William &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to him with another in&s;o|lent me&s;&s;age, demanding he would &s;urrender the crown which he had &s;o per&s;i|diou&s;ly u&s;urped; and Harold retorted his arrogance by another emba&s;&s;y of the &s;ame nature, to which the duke made no an&s;wer. The Engli&s;h monarch hav|ing a&s;&s;embled all his forces, advanced again&s;t the Norman army, and encamp|ed within &s;even miles of Ha&s;tings, where they were po&s;ted. While they re|mained at &s;uch a &s;mall di&s;tance from each other, on the eve of a deci&s;ive battle, the &s;pies of Harold brought &s;uch a report of the &s;trength and di&s;cipline of the Normans, that the principal officers of the Engli&s;h army began to doubt of their &s;ucce&s;s. And Harold's brother Gurth advi&s;ed the king to defer the battle; repre|&s;enting that the Normans would be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the delay, and in all probability obliged to leave the kingdom, at the approach of winter; whereas the Engli&s;h army would daily increa&s;e: but, if he was determined to ri&s;que an engagement, he intreated Harold to retire, that in ca&s;e the troops &s;hould be defeated, he might be in a condition to attack the victors with a fre&s;h body of forces. The king re|jected this advice with di&s;dain, declaring, he would, by his per&s;onal behaviour, convince his &s;ubjects he was worthy of the crown they had &s;et upon his head; and affirming that the Normans were not more formidable than the Norwegian$ whom he had &s;o lately conquered.</P>

<P>The duke of Normandy perceiving that Harold was determined to give him battle, advanced a little way, and took po&s;t in an advantageous &s;itu|ation, where he could have room to draw up his army in order of battle; and at this juncture he abated a little of his former pride and ferocity. Con&s;cious of the greatne&s;s of that &s;take which he was going to hazard, he &s;ent a monk to Harold, offering to refer their di&s;pute to the determination of the pope; to quit the kingdom, provided he would do him homage for the crown; or to decide the quarrel in &s;ingle combat. To the&s;e propo&s;itions Harold replied, that he was not &s;o &s;imple as to &s;ubmit to the arbitration of the pope, who had already declared him&s;elf a party; that he &s;corned to hold the crown of England depend|ent on any prince whatever; nor would he put his kingdom on the i&s;&s;ue of a &s;ingle combat, in which, though he &s;hould obtain the victory, he could reap no &s;olid advantage. He therefore told the me&s;&s;enger that God would next day decide between him and his adver&s;ary.</P>

for the battle. Next day, being the 14th of October, and the anniver&s;ary of Harold's birth, both armies appeared fronting each other, in order of battle. The vanguard of the Engli&s;h was compo&s;ed of Kenti&s;hmen, in con&s;equence of a pri|vilege they enjoyed &s;ince the beginning of the Saxon heptarchy; and Harold commanded the main body on foot, as much expo&s;ed as the meane&s;t of his &s;oldiers. The Normans were formed in three lines, the fir&s;t of which was com|manded by Montgomery and Fitzo&s;berne; Geoffrey Martel conducted the &s;e|cond; and the duke headed the body of re&s;erve, that he might occa&s;ionally &s;u&s;tain tho&s;e who &s;hould need his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The number of the Normans amounted to &s;ixty thou&s;and, including the archers and a &s;trong body of cavalry armed cap-a-pee. The Engli&s;h were not &s;o numerous, and con&s;i&s;ted mo&s;tly of infantry armed with the target, battle-ax, &s;pear, and &s;cymitar.</P>

<P>The Normans began the battle, advancing while they &s;ung the bal|lad of Orlando, and letting fly a &s;hower of arrows, which di&s;compo&s;ed the Engli&s;h, who were not accu&s;tomed to &s;uch mi&s;&s;iles; neverthele&s;s, they immedi|ately clo&s;ed their files, and gave the Normans &s;uch a warm reception, that they were obliged to retire a little and take breath. They repeated the attack, but could make no impre&s;&s;ion upon the Engli&s;h phalanx; and, in a word, the battle was fought with equal valour on both &s;ides, from &s;even in the morning till the afternoon, before an inch of ground was lo&s;t or won on either &s;ide, not|with&s;tanding the various efforts and undaunted courage of both chiefs, who ex|hibited repeated proofs of martial conduct, and animated their men by their pre&s;ence, admonition, and example. At length William put in practice a &s;trata|gem to which his army had been regularly trained; he ordered a retreat to be &s;ounded, and immediately his lines gave way, with &s;uch appearance of confu|&s;ion, that the Engli&s;h believing them routed, for&s;ook their ranks, and pur&s;ued with equal impetuo&s;ity and di&s;order. The duke of Normandy &s;eeing their im|penetrable column broke into &s;mall detachments di&s;per&s;ed about the field, or|dered another &s;ignal to be made, at &s;ight of which his men formed again in an in&s;tant, and, &s;urrounding the detached bodies of the Engli&s;h, made a terrible &s;laughter. Harold, enraged to &s;ee the victory thus wre&s;ted from his gra&s;p, ran about the field with the utmo&s;t agility, rallying his men and reduc|ing them to order, and at length took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a ri&s;ing-ground, where he was joined by &s;uch a number of the fugitives, that he &s;oon found him&s;elf in a condition to make head again&s;t the enemy. The Normans advanced to attack them, and were repul&s;ed. Had Harold taken this opportunity of retiring, he might have &s;aved him&s;elf and the greate&s;t part of his army, and, in all pro|bability, the Norman would have been glad to make peace on equal terms: but, he could not bear the di&s;grace of leaving the field of battle to his adver|&s;ary, and re&s;olved to maintain his po&s;t till next day, when he would try his fortune in another engagement.</P>

<P>William perceiving the night approaching, and unwilling to leave the battle undecided, made another de&s;perate effort to di&s;lodge the Engli&s;h, and in this attack Harold was &s;hot dead with an arrow that pierced his brain. His troops &s;eeing their gallant leader fall, were overwhelmed with con&s;ter$ation and de&s;pair, and fled immediately with the utmo&s;t precipitation; while the Norman hor&s;e pur&s;uing, as long as they could &s;ee their way, made a terrible carnage, without granting quarter to a &s;ingle man. Yet a good part of the Engli&s;h ar|my,

favoured by the darkne&s;s, was &s;aved by the conduct of Morcar and Edwin, who had fought with great courage, until the king and his two brothers were &s;lain; and then &s;eeing the toops broken and di&s;pirited, had yielded to the fortune of the day. In this long and bloody engagement, which decided the fate of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.Ch. 1066.</NOTE> England, the victor lo&s;t &s;ix thou&s;and men; but a much greater number of the vanqui&s;hed were &s;lain. William having thus attained the accompli&s;hment of his wi&s;h, ordered his whole army to kneel and return thanks to heaven for the victory they had obtained: then he directed a tent to be pitched in the middle of the &s;lain, and there he pa&s;&s;ed the remaining part of the night. In the morning his &s;oldiers were employed in burying their dead countrymen, while the pea&s;ants of the neighbourhood were permitted to perform the &s;ame office to the Engli&s;h, who had lo&s;t their lives in the battle. Harold's body was &s;o mangled and defaced that it could not be di&s;covered, until a lady, whom he had kept as a mi&s;tre&s;s, di&s;tingui&s;hed it by &s;ome private mark, known to her&s;elf<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sim.

Being thus recognized, it was &s;ent, together with the bodies of his bro|thers Gurth and Lewin, to their mother Githa, by whom they were honoura|bly interred in the abbey of Waltham, which Harold him&s;elf had founded <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">During the battle, which was fought near Heathfield, in Suffex, at a place &s;ince called Battel, the duke of Normandy had three hor&s;es killed $nder him; and was frequently in mani|fe&s;t hazard of his life.

During this reign, however, Withlaf, the tributary<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>The reigns of Ethelbald, Ethelbert, and Ethelred I. are very barren of all eccle&s;ia&s;tical matter, except the de&s;truction of mona&s;teries by the Danes, which the hi&s;torians of tho&s;e days have de&s;cribed in very pathetic terms; regret|ting in particular the three famous convents of Croyland, Ely, and Mederham&s;tede, in which the monks were maffacred and the libraries burned. We have already ob&s;erved, that the cruelty of the Danes was &s;o inveterate again&s;t every per&s;on ap|pertaining to the culture of the chri&s;tian religion, that tho&s;e few monks who e&s;caped their barbarity, either quitted the kingdom, or had recour&s;e to other em|ployments for a livelihood, when they found them&s;elves deprived of the reve|nues upon which they formerly &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; &s;o that Alfred the Great, when he triumphed over tho&s;e invaders, could find no monks in England, and was obliged to repleni&s;h the mona&s;teries he built with eccle&s;ia&s;tics invited from fo|reign countries.

<P>Among tho&s;e learned &s;trangers who a&s;&s;i&s;ted Alfred in his great work of re&s;toring the lu&s;tre of the church, and reviving the arts and &s;ciences, the principal were the&s;e: Johannes Scotus Erigena, an Iri&s;h Scot, who had &s;tudied at Athens, and in other foreign countries, and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the Greek and oriental tongues. He then repaired through Italy to France, where he acquired an eminent degree of favour and familiarity with Charles the Bald; and the fame of his talents extending to England, he was invited hither by Al|fred, whom he in&s;tructed in the liberal arts, and who&s;e friend&s;hip he enjoyed notwith&s;tanding his oppo&s;ition to the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, which ren|dered him obnoxious to the &s;ee of Rome. Towards the latter part of his life<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. Malme$$.</NOTE> he opened a &s;cho l in the mona&s;tery of Malme&s;bury, where his &s;cholars mur|dered him with their penknives, though we are ignorant of the occa&s;ion. An|other foreigner, for whom Alfred conceived a very early affection, was one Grimbald, who entertained him &s;o ho&s;pitably in his journey to Rome, that he afterwards created him abbot of Winche&s;ter. He was a learned divine, well &s;killed in mu&s;ic, and di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf for his talents in oratory. The fir&s;t abbot of the new abbey, founded in the i&s;le of Athelney, was a native of old Saxony, and almo&s;t all the monks, prie&s;ts, and deacons, were foreigners. Not but that his own country produced a number of men, who di&s;tingui&s;hed them|&s;elves by their piety and erudition; namely, A&s;&s;er Meneven&s;is, a monk of St. David's, &s;o attached to his retirement, that all the care&s;&s;es and favours of Al|$$ed could not prevail upon him to for&s;ake it entirely, though he con&s;ented to

live one half year with the king, who promoted him to the bi&s;hopric of Sher|born, and be&s;towed upon him many other marks of his particular regard: yet, he mu&s;t not be confounded with his name-&s;ake and uncle A&s;&s;erius, archbi&s;hop of St. David's, who wrote part of Alfred's life. John, the monk, belonging to the &s;ame mona&s;tery, to who&s;e in&s;truction the king owed his knowledge of the Latin tongue. Werefred, bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, who had been driven by the Danes into bani&s;hment, from whence he was recalled by Alfred, who employed him to tran&s;late Gregory's dialogues. Plegmund, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and Dunwulf, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, who is &s;aid by &s;ome authors to have been the very cowherd whom Alfred &s;erved in di&s;gui&s;e: that prince it &s;eems di&s;co|vered in him a genius far above his &s;tation in life, which he exalted in propor|tion to his merit.</P>

<P>But of all the eccle&s;ia&s;tics who dignified the court of Alfred, Neotus or St. Neot, was the mo&s;t remarkable for his learning, piety, and example. In being de&s;cended from the blood royal of the Ea&s;t-Angles, he was re&s;pected as a prince as well as a prelate; and is &s;aid, by his per&s;onal authority and admonitions, to have re&s;tricted the &s;allies of Alfred's youth. He was bu|ried at St. Guerer's church, at Gain&s;bury, in Cornwal; and &s;uch, by that time, was the general opinion of his &s;anctity, that he &s;upplanted the Corni&s;h &s;aint, and gave his own name to the church, which was thenceforward called Neot|&s;tow. The palace of earl Alric, in Huntingdon&s;hire, was afterwards converted into a mona&s;tery, and dedicated to this &s;aint, who&s;e body was tran&s;lated thither; though not &s;uffered to remain in this place neither; for, in the reign of king John, his bones were removed from this St. Neods, to the abbey of Croyland. This eccle&s;ia&s;tic, and the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e abovementioned, taught together in the univer&s;ity of Oxford, which was regulated and endowed by Alfred, who frequently a&s;&s;i&s;ted in per&s;on at their exerci&s;es, until &s;ome di&s;putes aro&s;e between the native and foreign profe&s;&s;ors, and then Grimbald retired to the mona&s;tery at Winche&s;ter, which the king had lately founded. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE></P>

<P>Alfred's &s;ucce&s;&s;or Edward imitated the virtues of his father in found|ing the univer&s;ity of Cambridge, as well as in a number of benefactions to the church: yet his reign is remarkable for a very particular exertion of the autho|rity of the Roman &s;ee. Pope Formo&s;us, being informed that the bi&s;hopric of We&s;&s;ex had been &s;even years vacant, &s;ent over a bull, excommunicating the king and all his &s;ubjects, which being publicly read at a general a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates, by Plegmund, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, the vacant &s;ees were im|mediately filled, and three new bi&s;hoprics erected in We&s;&s;ex. Then Pleg|mund &s;et out for Rome, where the &s;entence was revoked, and at his return to<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. Malme&s;$.</NOTE> England he con&s;ecrated &s;even prelates in one day. Plegmund was &s;ucceeded in the &s;ee of Canturbury by Athelm, bi&s;hop of Wells, who crowned Athel&s;tan, at King|&s;ton upon Thames; and during the reign of this prince was held the &s;ynod of Greatly, in which, be&s;ides the political con&s;titutions already mentioned, Athel|&s;tan ordained, that all his own domaines &s;hould pay tythes to the church; and a poor Engli&s;hman be maintained from the product of every two farms in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. After the death of Athel&s;tan, Odo, bi&s;hop of Sherburn, was pro|moted to the &s;ee of Canterbury. He was a Dane by extraction, though born in Ea&s;t-Anglia, and di&s;inherited by his parents on account of his attachment to the Chri&s;tian religion. His &s;ufferings recommended him to the $span$
<PB N="208" REF="2170">
a nobleman called Adhelm, who per&s;uaded him to take orders; and by his in|tere&s;t he was rai&s;ed to the &s;ee of Sherburn. Edmund, the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Athel&s;tan, importuned him to accept of the archbi&s;hopric of Canterbury, which, however, he for &s;ome time refu&s;ed, from a &s;cruple of con&s;cience, believing that tran&s;lations were unlawful. When this objection was removed, by producing the example of Miletus and Ju&s;tus, he was &s;eized with a more ridiculous qualm, &s;uppo&s;|ing no per&s;on but a monk could be qualified for an archbi&s;hopric; &s;o that the king was obliged to &s;end commi&s;&s;aries to France, to prevail upon the abbot of Fleury, to admit him into his &s;ociety. After his elevation this bigotted prie&s;t publi&s;hed a body of canons, in which he denounces excom|munication again&s;t all violators of the church's property and exemptions; declares that tho&s;e who refu&s;e to obey the di&s;cipline of the church, are more wicked than the &s;oldiers who crucified Chri&s;t; that it is the duty of kings, princes, and other per&s;ons in authority, to obey with great humility the arch|bi&s;hops and bi&s;hops, who keep the keys of heaven, and po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of b$nding and loo&s;ing; and that all the laity &s;hould be &s;crupulou&s;ly exact in paying the tythes to the clergy.</P>

<P>In the reign of Edmund, a great &s;ynod was convoked at London, in which bi&s;hops were enjoined to repair their churches, and the king required to e&s;tabli&s;h funds for their &s;upport. In the cour&s;e of the following year, another a&s;&s;embly enacted con&s;titutions for the advancement of the chri&s;tian religion, and the maintenance of concord among the people. Here al&s;o churches and royal<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spe$m.

About this period the famous Dun&s;tan began to &s;ignalize him&s;elf in the church and &s;tate. He was by birth a We&s;t-Saxon, de&s;cended of a noble family, and educated at Gla&s;tonbury, under a learned Iri&s;h monk, who in&s;tructed youth in that mona&s;|tery. Having made extraordinary progre&s;s in his &s;tudies, he was recommend|ed by Adhe$m, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, to king Athel&s;tan, who took him under his protection, but no &s;ooner perceived his ambitious views and meddling di&s;po&s;ition, than he di&s;carded him from his court. It was then that Dun&s;tan retired in di&s;gu&s;t from the world, and conceived that affection for the monks which he &s;o cordially expre&s;&s;ed in the whole cour&s;e of his future grandeur. Ed|mund, at his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, invited him from his retreat, and made him his confe&s;&s;or; but he was for &s;ome mi&s;demeanor di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from this office, which however he regained by d$nt of intere&s;t, and acquired amazing influence under this monarch and his brother Edred. The mona&s;tic life was at the &s;ame time dignified by an illu&s;trious member in the per&s;on of Turketyl, who was an excellent &s;oldier and &s;ound politician, and quitted the office of chancellor to em|brace the life of a reclu&s;e, at Croyland, of which he was made abbot, after having received the habit, together with the epi&s;copal benediction and pa&s;to|ral &s;taff. He was no &s;ooner e&s;tabli&s;hed in this eccle&s;ia&s;tical office, than he re&s;igned the mona&s;tery, with all its deeds, to Edred, who afterwards re|&s;tored them to Turkytel and his monks, in a full a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates at London, when he exempted them from all &s;ervice and incumbrances, and con|firmed all the former privileges of the mona&s;tery, except that of its being a &s;anctuary, which the abbot wi&s;ely refu&s;ed.</P>

We have already ob|&s;erved how the clamour rai&s;ed by the monks on this occa&s;ion, co&s;t Edwy the be&s;t part of his dominions; and mentioned the &s;teps which were taken in the &s;ucceeding reign by Dun&s;tan, to expel the &s;ecular prie&s;ts, in their turn, on pre|tence that they did not lead a life of celibacy, according to the in&s;titutions of the councils and &s;ee of Rome. Yet, notwith&s;tanding all his credit and eagerne&s;s of affection for the monks, it was not in his power to re-e&s;tabli&s;h them in the mona&s;teries of the north, which had been de&s;erted above two hundred years; in&s;omuch that the order was &s;carce known in the province of Northumberland.</P>

The&s;e were followed by another &s;et, by which it appears that prie&s;ts took young &s;tudents to &s;erve a kind of clerk&s;hip, before they were admitted to holy orders; for, one of the canons forbids any prie&s;t to take a &s;tudent without the con&s;ent of his former tutor. There is another, obliging every prie&s;t to learn &s;ome occupation, as an handicraft&s;man: and the re$t enjoin all eccle&s;ia&s;tics to learn the creed and pater-no&s;ter; to have the ho&s;t always in readine&s;s, and burn it carefully when it grows &s;tale, &s;o as that the a&s;hes may be put under the altar.

Before his elevation to the &s;ee of Canterbury, the fame of his &s;anctity had &s;pread all over Europe; &s;o that when he went to Rome for the pall the pope received him with uncommon marks of e&s;teem and affection.

He had been formerly bi&s;hop of Elman, in Norfolk, and ejected in con&s;equence of a quarrel with one Grimkettle; but he found means to retrieve his intere&s;t, and be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the &s;ee of Sel&s;ey, while his brother Ethelmar was made bi&s;hop of the Ea&s;t-Angles. At this period a revolution happened in the &s;ee of Crediton in Devon|&s;hire, which was removed to Exeter, under a Lorrainer called Leoffric, a man of great learning and quality, who was highly honoured and e&s;teemed by Edward and his queen. He ejected all the monks from the mona&s;teries of St. Peter, and in their room introduced canons, who are together at one table, &s;le$t in one apartment, and were provided with food and raiment by a &s;teward of the the bi&s;hop's appointing. King Edward being di&s;quieted with &s;ome &s;cruples, touching a vow he had made in his di&s;tre&s;s to vi&s;it Rome, which the kingdom was very aver&s;e to his performing; he, by the advice of his conncil, &s;ent Alured bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter with an emba&s;&s;y to the pope, de&s;iring that his holine&s;s would quiet his con&s;cience, by ab&s;olving him of the vow, as the welfare of his &s;ubjects did not permit him to undertake the journey in per&s;on. Leo IX, who then filled the papal chair, hearing the circum&s;tances explained, complied with the king's reque&s;t; but, by way of commutation, enjoined him to di&s;tribute in alms a &s;um equal to what he might have expended in his journey; and to found a new mona&s;tery, the charter of which he confirmed before hand. Mean while Egilric re&s;igned the &s;ee of Durham to his brother Egilwin. He found a great trea&s;ure in laying the foundation of a church dedicated to St. Cuthbert; and was &s;o enriched by this accident, that he laid a&s;ide his epi&s;copal function, and amu&s;ed him&s;elf in carrying on works of convenience for the emolument of the country.</P>

<P>Edward, on occa&s;ion of con&s;ecrating the church and abbey of We&s;t|min&s;ter, which he undertook by the pope's advice, re&s;olved to &s;end another em|ba&s;&s;y
<PB N="212" REF="2210">
to Rome, for the confirmation of the privileges be&s;towed upon this new foundation. The per&s;ons nominated for this &s;ervice were Aldred archbi&s;hop of York, Goodwin's &s;on To&s;ton, Gi&s;o bi&s;hop of Wells, and Walter bi&s;hop of Hereford. Pope Nicholas II. received all the&s;e deputies with great honour, ex|cept Aldred, who holding the &s;ees of York and Worce&s;ter together, without any di&s;pen&s;ation from the pope, was tried and convicted of &s;imon$, and dive&s;ted of his character and juri&s;diction. The emba&s;&s;adors being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by his holine&s;s, had &s;carce lo&s;t &s;ight of Rome, when they were &s;et upon and robbed by banditti: a circum&s;tance which obliged them to return to the city, that they might be equipped anew for their journey. To&s;ton took this opportunity of demanding that the p$pe would indemnify him for the damage he had &s;u&s;tained. Find|ing no redre&s;s, he gave his holi$e&s;s to under&s;tand, that he &s;u&s;pected him of being concerned in the robbery; and would therefore, at his return to England, prevail upon the king to &s;top the payment of Peter p$nce, until he and his fellow-travel|lers &s;hould be reimbur&s;ed.</P>

<P>Nicholas, &s;tartled at this declaration, offered to compromi&s;e the af|fair; and, in order to appea&s;e the clamour of To&s;ton, agreed that Aldred &s;hould be re&s;tored to his dignity, and even receive the pall as archbi&s;hop of York, pro|vided he would re&s;ign the &s;ee of Worce&s;ter. The propo&s;al was embraced, the accommodation effected, and Nicholas &s;ent two legates to a&s;&s;i&s;t Aldred in con|&s;ecrating Wulf&s;tan bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter; becau&s;e Stigand archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury was looked upon as an u&s;urper by the &s;ee of Rome, ina&s;much as he had ta|ken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion during the life of Robert the Norman, and not yet received the pall from his holine&s;s. Stigand, neverthele&s;s, performed his metropolitanical functions, without paying any regard to the di&s;approbation of the pope, becau&s;e he found him&s;elf con&s;idered and revered as an archbi&s;hop by the king and people of England. Nor would he &s;uffer this con&s;ecration of Wulf&s;tan to affect his au|thority; for, he obliged Aldred to declare before the king and council, that he re|nounced<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spelman. G. M$lme&s;$.</NOTE> all preten&s;ions to eccle&s;ia&s;tical or &s;ecular authority over Wulf&s;tan, whom he had con&s;ecrated.</P>

<P>Together with this &s;hort &s;ketch of the Engli&s;h eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, it will not be improper to give a brief ab&s;tract of the tran&s;actions of the Wel&s;h church during the &s;ame period. In or near the reign of Alfred, &s;even &s;ynods were held at Landaff, though the dates of them are very uncertain. In the fir&s;t, king Tudor was excommunicated for periury and murder. The &s;econd, a&s;&s;embled by bi&s;hop Berthguin, pronounced the &s;entence of excommunication again&s;t king Clolti, for the &s;ame offences. The third pa&s;&s;ed the like cen&s;ure upon Gurcan, for the crime of ince&s;t with his own mother-in-law. Bi&s;hop Cerenhir convoked the fourth &s;ynod, by which king Howel was &s;tigmatized for murder and perjury. The &s;ame prel$te pre&s;ided in the &s;ixth, and proceeded in the &s;ame manner again&s;t Conbli, for the &s;ame offences. The &s;eventh was held by Civeillianc, again&s;t king Brochvail, who had in &s;ome &s;hape incurred his di&s;plea&s;ure; and all the&s;e kings, who were no other than petty toparchs, made very humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, underwent &s;evere penance, and payed heavy fines to the church, before they obtained ab&s;olution. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there was another council convened at the &s;ame place, on account of &s;ome ravages committed again&s;t the church by king Nougu$, who &s;ubmitted to the cen&s;ure of the &s;ynod. A &s;ub&s;equent a&s;&s;em|bly was called to deliberate upon the violation of a &s;anctuary, from which the
<PB N="213" REF="2220">
magi&s;trate had taken by force a deacon guilty of per&s;idious murder. They vigo|rou&s;ly &s;upported the rights of the church on this occa&s;ion, and compelled the civil power to deliver up the criminal. The la&s;t convocation was held by Gucan, whom Dun&s;tan had con&s;ecrated bi&s;hop of Landaff; in order to denounce excom|munication again&s;t Arthmail, who had murdered his own brother. The criminal &s;ubmitted to the juri&s;diction of the &s;ynod, and purcha&s;ed his pardon with a large &s;um for the benefit of the clergy.</P>

<P>BY the defeat of Ha&s;tings the Engli&s;h were not only deprived of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1606.</NOTE> their king, but al&s;o the flower of their nobility, and left without any fea&s;ible &s;cheme or determination by which they could take mea&s;ures for repairing the lo&s;s they had &s;u&s;tained. Harold's brothers were &s;lain, his children had e&s;caped into Ireland, and Edgar Atheling, though beloved by the people as the offspring of their ancient kings, had neither &s;pirit, capacity, nor inclination, to take the helm of government in &s;uch a tempe&s;tuous &s;ea&s;on. Count Morcar and his brother Edwin were &s;till alive indeed, and had retired to Lon|don with the remains of the army; but, their authority was not &s;ufficient to ex|ecute &s;uch mea&s;ures as were nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of the common-wealth; the diver&s;ity of opinions ari&s;ing from different motives of intere&s;t, terror, and de|&s;pair, produ$ed a dreadful anarchy of perplexity and con&s;ternation.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; II.</HEAD>
<P>W$ile this di&s;traction prevailed at London, the conqueror con&s;idered that the $$&s;s of a battle might a&s;toni&s;h, but would hardly terrify the Engli&s;h into &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; as they had &s;till con&s;iderable re&s;ources of men and arms, with which
<PB N="216" REF="2250">
they would in all likelihood try their fortune again in the field; that if he &s;hould be defeated in his turn, he had no place of retreat in which he could find refuge un|til he &s;hould be reinforced from Normandy; and that the party which he had in England might foment divi&s;ions in the &s;tate, which would operate for his intere&s;t, provided he &s;hould give them time to practi&s;e on the minds of the people; where|as, &s;hould he advance immediately to London, they would unite from the &s;en&s;e of their common danger, before they could find lei&s;ure to con&s;ult their different views and conjectures. Urged by the&s;e reflections, William, in&s;tead of marching directly to London, inve&s;ted Dover, which was &s;trongly fortified by art as well as nature, and provided with a numerous garri&s;on, reinforced by tho&s;e who e&s;|caped from the battle; &s;o that it might have made a vigorous de&s;ence: but, &s;uch was the con&s;ternation diffu&s;ed among them by the &s;ucce&s;s of his arms, that they &s;urrendered in a few days; and he ordered the fortifications to be repaired<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> and augmented.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; III.</HEAD>
<P>Having tarried about a week in this neighbourhood, in order to ani|mate the workmen by his pre&s;ence, he began his march for London; and ad|vancing in per&s;on, with a &s;mall body of hor&s;e, at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the re&s;t of the army, he is &s;aid to have been met by the Kenti&s;hmen with boughs in their hands. When he halted to ob&s;erve this moving fore&s;t, they &s;uddenly threw down their branches, and appeared to be a &s;trong body of men, armed with an intention to di&s;pute his pa&s;&s;age: while he con&s;idered this phenome|non, the deputies of the Kenti&s;hmen approached, and made a tender of their &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thorn.</NOTE> provided he would not infringe their privileges. William granted their demand; and they took the oath of allegiance, and retired. But, even after this impediment was removed, he could not proceed with much expedition, becau&s;e a dy&s;entery prevailed in his army, and he him&s;elf was &s;eized with the &s;ame di&s;|temper, which not a little retarded his march.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; IV.</HEAD>
<P>By this time Morcar and Edwin had a&s;&s;embled in London almo&s;t all the remaining nobility of the kingdom, to deliberate upon mea&s;ures to be ta|ken in the pre&s;ent emergency, both for &s;ettling the government of the nation, and rai&s;ing an army to oppo&s;e the Normans. The two brothers propo&s;ed that Edgar Atheling &s;hould be placed upon the throne; and this motion was warmly &s;econded by archbi&s;hop Stigand and the Londoners, who were extremely rich and powerful; but the greate&s;t part of the clergy favoured the de&s;igns of the Nor|man, either becau&s;e they looked upon him as a devout prince, under whom the church would flouri&s;h, or dreaded the cur&s;es and re&s;entment of the pope, who had already declared in his behalf. They could not, however, with all their arts, prevent Edgar from being proclaimed king of England; though they had inte|re&s;t enough to prevent his levying &s;uch an army as could &s;upport his authority again&s;t &s;uch a powerful rival. The excerci&s;e of his &s;overeignty was therefore of very &s;hort duration.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; V.</HEAD>
<P>William continued advancing in three divi&s;ions, by three different routes; and his men were ordered, if they &s;hould meet with any re&s;i&s;tance, to de|&s;troy the country with fire and &s;word. Accordingly, &s;light pretences were made handles for committing terrible outrages, at which the duke connived, on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that &s;uch &s;everity would intimidate the Engli&s;h, and facilitate their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. As he approached the capital, in this manner, the terrors of the people waxed &s;tronger and &s;tronger, and the clergy employed all their indu&s;try and in&s;i|nuation
<PB N="217" REF="2260">
to di&s;&s;uade them from making a re&s;i&s;tance, which would only &s;erve to exa&s;perate the victor; whereas they might expect the confirmation of their liberty and privileges in the way of negotiation.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; VI.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e remon&s;trances, added to the nearne&s;s of the danger, had &s;uch weight with the citizens of London, who had more at &s;take than any other &s;ub|jects of England, that their courage began to flag, and they earne&s;tly expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of accommodation. Morcar and Edwin, with a view to animate their party, took the opportunity to &s;ally out from London upon William, who arrived in the neighbourhood of that city at the head of his fir&s;t divi&s;ion. They re&s;olved to attack him before he could be &s;u&s;tained by the re&s;t of his army, and hoped to find him fatigued from his march: but the Norman was too vigi|lant<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1066.</NOTE> to be &s;o &s;urprized; and gave them &s;uch a warm reception, that they were fain to retire with great precipitation. This check di&s;pirited the friends of Ed|gar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. Pictav.</NOTE> and furni&s;hed the clergy with fre&s;h arguments in favour of the mea&s;ures they had propo&s;ed; &s;o that they &s;oon made a multitude of pro&s;elytes to their opinion, while Edwin and his brother, perceiving Edgar's cau&s;e de&s;perate, re|treated with their forces to the northern provinces.</P>

<P>By this time the advanced parties of the Normans had burned the &s;ub|urbs on the Surry &s;ide of the river, by the command of William, who&s;e army pa&s;&s;ing the Thames at Wallingford, was now as far as Bergham&s;tead in their march to London; &s;o that the nobles and prelates, a&s;&s;embled at London, would no longer delay to &s;eize the only opportunity they would have to plead the merit of a voluntary &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. They accordingly went forth, attended by the magi&s;|trates of London, and meeting the duke at the head of his troops, made a &s;o|lemn tender of the crown. He received them with great courte&s;y, and after having taken time to deliberate upon the propo&s;al, accepted the offer they had made, and a&s;&s;ured them they &s;hould have no cau&s;e to repent of their choice: he did not think proper however to tru&s;t him&s;elf in the city of London, but e&s;tabli&s;hed his head quarters at Berking, in E&s;&s;ex, until a fort could be built in the city to overawe the inhabitants. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Id.

<HEAD>&sect; VIII.</HEAD>
<P>Edward Atheling, encouraged by the report of his affability, went thither to renounce his preten&s;ions, and implored the protection of William, by whom he was graciou&s;ly received. Morcar and Edwin having no further pre|text for keeping aloof, &s;ollicited his forgivene&s;s, and di&s;banding their troops, went to receive his commands; and their example was followed by all the lords and corporations of the kingdom. The Norman, having thus acknowledged the power of election in the people of England, in deigning to receive the crown as a pre&s;ent, was immediately proclaimed king, and appointed the day for his coronation at London. Stigand, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, lying under a &s;en|tence of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion by the pope, to whom William owed great obligations, this prince, in order to avoid any objection that might be made with re&s;pect to the in|formality of his con&s;ecration, de&s;ired that the ceremony might be performed by Aldred, archbi&s;hop of York, who, upon that occa&s;ion, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Engli&s;h, a&s;&s;embled in great numbers, a&s;ked if they cho&s;e William, duke of Normandy, for their king; and was an&s;wered in the affirmative with loud ac|clamations. The bi&s;hop of Con&s;tance having put the &s;ame que&s;tion to the Nor|mans, and received the like reply, Aldred &s;et the crown on his head; and then
<PB N="218" REF="2270">
the Norman took the accu&s;tomed oath, importing that he would protect the church and its mini&s;ters, govern his people with equity, enact ju&s;t laws, and cau&s;e<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. Malme$$.</NOTE> them to be punctually ob&s;erved.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; IX.</HEAD>
<P>The fir&s;t act of &s;overeignty he exerci&s;ed after his coronation was the &s;eizure of Harold's trea&s;ure, which he found ama&s;&s;ed at Winche&s;ter. Part of this he di&s;tributed among the principal officers of his army; part was given to churches and mona&s;teries; and a large &s;hare &s;ent to the pope, either to di&s;charge a debt, which he owed to his holine&s;s, or as a mark of his gratitude for the coun|t$nance<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gul. Pict.</NOTE> of that pontiff, to which he in a great mea&s;ure owed his &s;ucce&s;s. He be|gun his reign with &s;uch moderation as afforded a happy omen to his &s;ubjects. He exhorted his principal officers to treat the Engli&s;h with humanity, and re&s;pect them as brothers; he i&s;&s;ued orders through his army, forbidding his &s;oldiers to attempt the cha&s;tity of the women, or commit the lea&s;t outrage again&s;t the inha|bitants, under the &s;evere&s;t penalties; and he publi&s;hed an edict, confirming all the privileges of the people, and all the promi&s;es he had made in their behalf. This &s;pecimen of his equity had a wonderful effect among the Engli&s;h, who vied with each other in te&s;tifying their loyalty and e&s;teem, by pre&s;enting him with great &s;ums of money, which helped him to defray the expence of the conque&s;t: nor could they blame his conduct, when he divided among his followers the lands of all the noblemen who had appeared in arms again&s;t him, as well tho&s;e that fell as tho&s;e that &s;urvived the battle. This was looked upon as a common act of ju&s;tice, e&s;pecially as he at the &s;ame time confirmed the re&s;t in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their e&s;tates. Among the&s;e, he di&s;tingui&s;hed with particular marks of favour, Ed|gar Atheling, called the darling of the Engli&s;h, whom he not only allowed to retain the earldom of Oxford, but affected to care&s;s on all occa&s;ions, as the ne|phew of his benefactor Edward. On other Engli&s;h noblemen he conferred po&s;ts of importance, both in Britain and Normandy, and projected matches between his officers and the ladies of England, while he provided Engli&s;h hu&s;bands for<NOTE PLACE="marg">M$t.

<P>He granted a new charter to the city of London, confirming the privileges which the citizens enjoyed in the reign of Edward the Confe&s;&s;or; he pre&s;erved the Saxon laws and con&s;titution; he made a progre&s;s into the provinces of Mer|cia and We&s;&s;ex, to confirm by his pre&s;ence and per&s;onal deportment, the great idea which the people had conceived from his fame. As the country was in|fe&s;ted with robbers, who found &s;helters in the woods, he exerted him&s;elf in ex|terminating tho&s;e banditti. He made excellent regulations for the &s;ecurity of the &s;ubjects from violence and rapine; and, as another in&s;tance of his piety and mode|ration, founded an abbey on the &s;pot where Harold had fallen, to which he gave the name of Battel, and there ordered ma&s;s to be &s;aid for the repo&s;e of Ha|rold's<NOTE PLACE="marg">Id.

The Tower of London, and the other forts he had erected at Norwich, Winche&s;ter, Hereford, Ha&s;tings, and Dover, were provided with &s;trong Norman garri&s;ons, and the citizens of London, as well as the other natives of the realm, whom the Saxon laws obliged to appear once a year in arms, furni&s;hed at their own expence, were now di&s;incumbered of this unnece&s;&s;ary burthen.

Having therefore no rea&s;on to ap|prehend any di&s;turbance in his ab&s;ence among the Engli&s;h, who&s;e affection he had taken &s;uch pains to conciliate; he left the regency with his brother Odo, bi&s;hop of Bayeux, and William Fitzosberne; and that he might neglect no means that &s;ound policy dictated, he re&s;olved to carry along with him all the Engli&s;h noblemen, from who&s;e power or inclination he could ap|prehend a revolt or in&s;urrection.

William &s;ignified his di&s;plea&s;ure at the freedom of this remon&s;trance; and, far from complying with the advice, ordered the Danegelt to be levied with extraordinary rigour.

The peo|ple, on this occa&s;ion, naturally turned their eyes upon the two brothers Edwin and Morcar, from who&s;e valour alone they expected deliverance from the Nor|man oppre&s;&s;ion.

Go&s;patrick and Merle&s;wain, two noblemen in the north, in&s;pired with this apprehen&s;ion for them&s;elves as well as for Edgar Atheling, per&s;uaded that prince to accompany them to Scot|land, to which he accordingly retired by &s;ea, with his mother Agatha, and his two &s;i&s;ters, Margaret and Chri&s;tina; and there they met with a very ho&s;pitable recep|tion from Malcolm, who married the elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, by whom he had Mathilda<NOTE PLACE="marg">F$or Wig.

By this time the Danes had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;trong po&s;t, between the Ou&s;e and the Trent, from whence he &s;aw it would be a very difficult enterprize to di&s;lodge them; he therefore had recour&s;e to a more ea&s;y expedient; and &s;ent private emi&s;&s;aries, with an offer of a large &s;um to O&s;bern, and permi&s;&s;ion to pillage all the &s;ea-coa&s;t, provided he would de&s;i&s;t from other acts of ho&s;tility, and retire in the &s;pring. The&s;e terms were embraced, and he returned in the &s;pring to Denmark, where his brother Swein puni&s;hed him &s;everely for having &s;o perfidiou&s;ly de&s;erted his allies. After this capitulation, the king advanced again&s;t York, the &s;iege of which he immediately undertook, and having made &s;ome progre&s;s in his operations, ordered an a&s;&s;ault to be given. The attack was very furious: but the place was defended &s;o vigorou&s;ly by the Engli&s;h and Scots, that the Normans were repul&s;ed with great &s;laughter; the valiant Waltheof planted him&s;elf in the breach, and with his battle-ax cleft down the a&s;&s;ailants as fa&s;t as they advanced. This worthy &s;on of old Siward, count of Northumber|land, behaved with &s;uch vigilance, conduct, and intrepidity, in the defence of the place, that William began to de&s;pair of reducing it, when famine compelled the governor to capitulate. The king, who had been eye-witne&s;s of his extra|ordinary

merit, not only granted him honourable terms, but afterward&s; be&s;tow|ed his own niece Judith upon him in marriage, and created him &s;ucce&s;&s;ively count of Northampton, Huntingdon, and Northumberland. He, at the &s;ame time, received Go&s;patrick into his favour, and found him a faithful and &s;erviceable adherent in the &s;equel; but he puni&s;hed the re&s;t of the officers and &s;oldiers of the garri&s;on with great &s;everity, and mulcted the inhabitants in a very large fine.</P>

<P>The city being properly &s;ecured with Norman garri&s;ons, he gave a loo&s;e to his vengeance again&s;t the Northumbrians, and ravaged the country in &s;uch a cruel manner, that there was not a hou&s;e left &s;tanding between York and Durham. He did not even &s;pare the churches and other public buildings. This de&s;olation was attended with the mo&s;t &s;hocking mi&s;ery: the wretched people, deprived of habitation and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, wandered about in di&s;traction and de&s;pair, &s;eeing their tender infants peri&s;hing by famine and cold, and their friends and neigh|bours falling in heaps, after having endeavoured to prolong their lives by devouring<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. Malme&s;b. Sim. Dun.</NOTE> dogs, cats; vermin, and even feeding upon human carca&s;es. From &s;uch &s;cenes of horrour and di&s;tre&s;s, great numbers of the common people fled into Scotland, and &s;ettled in the lowlands, which they greatly improved with agriculture; abun|dance of the better &s;ort, who&s;e e&s;tates were confi&s;cated, or who&s;e minds were aver&s;e to the Norman &s;way, retired al&s;o to that country, where they were kindly re|ceived by queen Margaret and her hu&s;band Malcolm, who a&s;&s;igned lands for<NOTE PLACE="marg">Le&s;ley de ori|gine &amp; ge&s;t.

<P>Rebellion multiplied like the Hydra's heads; one revolt was no &s;ooner quelled in one place, than two fre&s;h commotions began in other parts of the country. When William &s;et out on the northern expedition, the people in|habiting the counties of Somer&s;et and Dor&s;et, ro&s;e in arms, and be&s;ieged Monta|cute; but were defeated by the ju&s;ticiary Geoffry, bi&s;hop of Coutance, who marched again&s;t them with the forces of London, Hants, and Wilt&s;hire: at the &s;ame time Edric the Forre&s;ter inve&s;ted Shrew&s;bury; which, however, he could not reduce; and the people of Devon&s;hire and Cornwal undertook the &s;iege of Ex|eter, which they were obliged to rai&s;e, by the bravery of the garri&s;on, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the inhabitants.</P>

<P>Again&s;t the Wel&s;h and Che&s;hire men, who &s;till kept in a body under Edric, the king began his march from York acro&s;s the country; and in the cour&s;e of his route through fens, mar&s;hes, woods, and over mountains, the army was &s;o much fatigued, that the &s;oldiers of Anjou, Maine, and Bretagne, de&s;ired to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. Willliam, however, encouraged them to proceed, and they arrived at Che&s;ter, where he made overtures of accommodation to Edric, who&s;e valour he admired; and that nobleman complying with his propo&s;als, ever after enjoyed a great &s;hare of his confidence and e&s;teem. This was a more effec|tual &s;tep towards the pacification of Mercia, than that of building ca&s;tles at<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flor.

<P>All the &s;ources of rebellion being now exhau&s;ted by policy or war, William, in order to prevent their filling again, re&s;olved to depre&s;s all Engli&s;h|men

of power and credit in &s;uch a manner as to render them incapable of rai&s;ing any con&s;iderable di&s;turbance again&s;t his reign for the future. With this view he &s;uddenly deprived them of all their offices, baronies, and fiefs holding of the crown, and di&s;tributed them among the Normans and other &s;trangers who had followed his fortune. But, as the&s;e bore a &s;mall proportion in point of number to the Engli&s;h who were &s;tripped, he loaded his countrymen with bene|fits before he could di&s;po&s;e of all the lands taken from the natives. He be&s;towed upon his uterine brother Robert, the county of Cornwal, comprehending two hundred and eighty-eight manours, be&s;ides five hundred and fifty-eight, which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in other provinces. His next brother Odo was created count palatine of Kent and high ju&s;ticiary of England, with above four hundred fiefs in diffe|rent provinces. William Fitzo&s;bern's &s;ervices were compen&s;ated with the whole county o$ Hereford. William's nephew, Hugh Loup, was pre&s;ented with the county palatine of Che&s;ter, to be held with all the rights of regality, as inde|pendent of the crown. His &s;on-in-law Alain Fergeant, duke of Bretagne, was put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the e&s;tates formerly belonging to count Mor|car, with the &s;ame rights of regality. To Roger de Montgomery he gave fir&s;t of all the towns of Arundel and Chiche&s;ter, and afterwards the coun|ty of Salop. Walter Giffard obtained the county of Buckingham; and that of Surry fell to the &s;hare of William Warren. Eudes, count of Blois, re|ceived the lord&s;hip of Holderne&s;s. Raoul de Guair, of Bretagne, was cre|ated count or earl of Norfolk and Suffolk, and lord of Norwich. Henry de Ferrieres was complimented with the ca&s;tle of Tutbury. And Geoffry, bi&s;hop of Coutance, ju&s;ticiary of England, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed two hundred and eighty manours, which he bequeathed at his death to his nephew Robert de Mowbray. All the&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were held by the &s;ame tenour as the e&s;tates in Normandy, where the feudal law preva led in full force; &s;ubject to the &s;ame forfeitures, and de&s;cend|ing in the &s;ame order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Thus was laid the foundation of what is cal|led the common law of England, the terms and proceedings of which, &s;o far<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spe$m Glo&s;&s; $$acy.</NOTE> as it relates to tenures and e&s;tates, are evidently derived from the language and cu&s;toms of the Normans.</P>

<P>In this manner was England delivered into the hands of foreigners: and we may well &s;uppo&s;e that the Norman lords would parcel out tho&s;e lands in copyholds or inferior fiefs to their own countrymen. The barons exerci&s;ed all kinds of juri&s;dictions within their own manours; they held courts, in which<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$. Ch. 1$$$.</NOTE> they admini&s;tered ju&s;tice to their own va&s;&s;als: the di&s;putes ari&s;ing between the tenants of different baronies were decided in the county or hundred courts, and the &s;uits between barons were cognizable only in the king's tribunals. The judges and lawyers were Normans, con&s;equently the pleadings were carried on in the language of that country: &s;o that the Engli&s;h could expect very little redre&s;s, when they complained of the oppre&s;&s;ion and in&s;ults they underwent<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$$q Sp $m.</NOTE> from their foreign &s;uperiors. Although, upon a repre&s;entation of the hard|&s;hips, &s;uffered in this re&s;pect by the people, made by Gui&s;mund, afterwards carcinal and bi&s;hop of Aver&s;a, William con&s;ented to allow them the benefits of &s;ome of the old laws relating to forfeitures, fines, and amerciaments, in cri|minal matters, and the rates of reliefs and mortuaries due to &s;uperior lords, tho&s;e laws were ea&s;ily wre&s;ted or evaded to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of oppre&s;&s;ion. Nay, to &s;uch &s;lavi&s;h re&s;trictions were they reduced, that all per&s;ons what&s;oever of the

commonalty in towns and villages, were commanded on pain of death to put out their fires and candles on the ringing of a bell, which was thence di&s;|tingui&s;hed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Du Moulin.</NOTE> by the appellation of couvre feu or cover fire, &s;ince corrupted into curfew; a regulation which, though it had been practi&s;ed at Caen in Normandy, for the prevention of riots, conflagrations, and other mi&s;chievous accidents, was, by the free independent &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h, con&s;trued into the mo&s;t de&s;po|tic exertion of arbitrary power, and re&s;ented accordingly.</P>

<P>The &s;everity of the conqueror's plan was not confined to the nobi|lity and the commons, but extended al&s;o to the clergy, who&s;e charters he vio|lated without &s;cruple, paying no manner of regard to the imprecations which former kings had denounced again&s;t tho&s;e of their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors who &s;hould attempt to infringe or annul the exemptions which they granted to bi&s;hops, abbeys, and churches. He ordained that church-lands, as well as others, &s;hould be &s;ubject to military &s;ervice, and furni&s;h a certain number of hor&s;emen in time of war; and if any eccle&s;ia&s;tic refu&s;ed to comply with this ordinance, he was removed from his benefice, which was given to a &s;tranger: be&s;ides, he lodged almo&s;t his whole army at free quarters in mona&s;teries. By the&s;e means he maintained his troops, without dimini&s;hing his own revenue, and at the &s;ame time kept a nece&s;|&s;ary watch over the conduct of the monks, who were very apt to intermeddle in politics. He executed another project, which was &s;till more provoking to that venerable body, and intailed upon him the &s;ecret cur&s;es of the people. Being informed by his emi&s;&s;aries that many families had depo&s;ited their plate and money in mona&s;teries, he ordered all tho&s;e religious hou&s;es to be &s;earched, and &s;eized upon every thing that was valuable, pretending it belonged to the rebels; he did not even &s;pare the &s;hrines of &s;aints and the &s;acred va&s;es on this occa&s;ion.</P>

<P>Not yet &s;atisfied with the&s;e mea&s;ures for the humiliation of the clergy, he re&s;olved to depre&s;s &s;ome bi&s;hops and abbots, who&s;e wealth and credit he looked upon with jealou&s;y and di&s;quiet. That he might proceed, however, in a judicial form on &s;uch important affairs, he directed the pope's two legates to a&s;&s;emble a council at We&s;tmin&s;ter, in which Stigand, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, was depo&s;ed for having intruded him&s;elf into that &s;ee, of which his predece&s;&s;or Robert had not been canonically deprived. Agelmar, bi&s;hop of Elmham in Ea&s;t-Anglia,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ingulph.</NOTE> Algeric of Durham, and &s;ome other prelates, di&s;agreeable to the king, met with the &s;ame fate; while others to who&s;e conduct he could take no ex|ception, were bani&s;hed or impri&s;oned without form of proce&s;s, and their places filled with &s;trangers from different climes. Lanfranc, an Italian, and formerly abbot of a mona&s;tery in Caen, he promoted to the &s;ee of Canterbury; Thomas, a canon of Bayeux, was created archbi&s;hop of York; the dioce&s;es of Winche&s;ter, Elmham, and Sel&s;ey, were be&s;towed upon three of his own chaplains, and the abbeys from which the Engli&s;h were expelled, &s;upplied with Norman superiors; neverthele&s;s, it mu&s;t be owned that the&s;e places were filled with per&s;ons of di&s;|tingui&s;hed merit. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rog. de Hov.</NOTE></P>

<P>William, in order to maintain tho&s;e encroachments on the liber|ty of the nation, found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport a large &s;tanding army, which could not be &s;ub&s;i&s;ted without great oeconomy, aswell as an immen&s;e revenue: he there|fore, among other regulations, erected the court of exchequer, for auditing and pa&s;&s;ing the accounts of all officers employed in collecting the crown revenue; for determining all actions relating thereto, and puni&s;hing the exactions and
<PB N="228" REF="2370">
irregularities of the collectors, as well as the delays and defaults of payment in the &s;ubject. His revenue, exclu&s;ive of the old deme&s;ne lands &s;et apart for &s;up|plying his hou&s;hold with all &s;orts of provi&s;ion, con&s;i&s;ted in a land tax called Danegelt, a quit-rent out of all the lands of England, ward&s;hips, reliefs, and fines, livery of hereditary lands, a&s;&s;ignation of dower, licen&s;es of marriage, leave to &s;ue in the king's-court, mulcts and forfeitures for marrying without li|cence, and other mi&s;$emeanors, and other pecuniary penalties, by which all &s;orts of crimes were puni&s;hed; tolls and cu&s;toms for pa&s;&s;age, pontage, freedom of fairs and markets, protection and liberty of buying and &s;elling, and duties laid upon merchandize. Be&s;ides the&s;e general branches, he received occa&s;ional aids due from the fees of tho&s;e who held of the crown by knight's-&s;ervice; and occa&s;ionally levied taillage upon &s;ocage tenants, and trading towns: &s;o that his revenue amounted to about four hundred thou&s;and pounds a year, every pound being really equal to that weight of &s;ilver, con&s;equently the whole to be e&s;timated at twelve hundred thou|&s;and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ord.

How rich and powerful then mu&s;t this king have been, who, over and above this va&s;t income, con&s;tantly main|tained &s;ixty thou&s;and knights, by quartering them upon mona&s;teries or a&s;&s;igning lands for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence!</P>

<P>This &s;tanding army was more grievous to the &s;ubject than all the other impo&s;itions combined: and far from taming them into abject &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, &s;erved only to render them de&s;perate, and excite them to enterprizes that &s;hould end either in liberty or de&s;truction. A new con&s;piracy was formed under the au&s;pices of Frederic, abbot of St. Alban's, for driving the king and Normans out of the country; and the &s;cheme was executed with &s;uch conduct and &s;ecrecy, that a con&s;iderable army was a&s;&s;embled before William received the lea&s;t intimation of their de&s;ign. Edgar Atheling, arriving from Scotland, put him&s;elf at the head of this in&s;urrection, and was proclaimed king of England in all the places that favoured their intention. The Norman was extremely di&s;turbed by this bold enterprize, which &s;eemed to be the prelude of a general revolt; and he im|parted the &s;ubject of his di&s;quiet to Lanfranc, the new archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who advi&s;ed him to treat the Engli&s;h with le&s;s &s;everity, and commence a negotia|tion with the rebels before the flame &s;hould &s;pread it&s;elf all over the kingdom. William accordingly propo&s;ed a conference with the chiefs of the mal$contents at Berkham&s;tead, where he heard with great temper the recapitulation of all their grievances, and not only promi&s;ed to redre&s;s them, but &s;wore upon the evangeli&s;ts he would ree&s;tabli&s;h the laws of Edward the Confe&s;&s;or. The male|contents, &s;atisfied with this conde&s;cen&s;ion in a prince of his character, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed their troops, and returned to their own homes; and the king no &s;ooner under&s;tood they were di&s;per&s;ed, than without paying the lea&s;t regard to his oath, which he con&s;idered as an extorted obligation, ordered a great number of tho&s;e who had taken up arms, to be apprehended, and &s;ome of them were put to death, &s;ome im|pri$oned and bani&s;hed the realm. Edgar returned to Scotland, others fled for refuge to Ireland, Denmark, and Norway, and the abbot of St. Alban's retired to the i&s;le of Ely, where he &s;oon died of grief and di&s;appointment. William im|mediate$y $eized the effects of his mona&s;tery, which he would have ruined in|tirely,

<P>While the tyranny of William intimidated one part of the nation into unre&s;i&s;ting &s;lavery, it exa&s;perated others into efforts of revenge. A good number of the&s;e de&s;perate adventurers retired to the i&s;le of Ely, which being &s;urrounded by a mora&s;s, they thought they &s;hould be able to defend them&s;elves from William's power. Thither he two brothers Morcar and Edwin re|paired from court, where they found them&s;elves expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t imminent danger from the king's jealou&s;y; though Edwin was afterwards killed by his own attendants, in his journey towards Scotland, which he undertook with a view to engage Malcolm in the cau&s;e of the revolters. Egelric and Egelwin, bi&s;hops of Durham and Hereford, together with many other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, joined the malecontents of Ely, who cho&s;e for their general the valiant Here|ward de Wake, who had, &s;ince his return to England, never cea&s;ed to harra&s;s the Normans, and was e&s;teemed the brave&s;t &s;oldier and mo&s;t expert warrior of his age. This nobleman being inve&s;ted with the chief command, and ju&s;tly<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ingulph. Hoveden.</NOTE> &s;uppo&s;ing that the place would &s;oon be attacked by William, employed all his &s;kill and attention in augmenting and improving the defences, and laying in a &s;ufficient &s;tore of provi&s;ion for a tedious &s;iege. The king, who was well ac|quainted with Hereward's capacity, ordered his troops to march immediately, in hope of &s;urprizing him before he &s;hould be prepared for oppo&s;ition; but he found &s;uch precautions already taken, that he retained no hope of reducing the place by any other way than that of &s;tarving the be&s;ieged; and therefore he converted his operations into a blockade. This, however, was a very tedious method of proceeding, as Hereward was plentifully &s;upplied with provi&s;ion, and the more vexatious to William at this juncture, as he was apprized of an irruption into the northern provinces made by Malcolm, king of Scotland.</P>

<DIV4 N="36" TYPE="section">

<P>At length he contrived a &s;cheme which &s;ucceeded to his wi&s;h: he &s;eized the lands belonging to the abbey which &s;tood within the i&s;le, and di&s;tri|buted them among his courtiers; an alienation that rai&s;ed a prodigious clamour among the monks, who importuned their abbot Thur&s;tan to make peace with the king, &s;o as that their manours &s;hould be re&s;tored. The abbot, thus incited, &s;ent a private emi&s;&s;ary to William, with a promi&s;e of delivering the i&s;le into his hands, together with a thou&s;and marks of $ilver, provided he would ree&s;tabli&s;h him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the lands he had taken away. The king complied with this<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1$$$.</NOTE> advantageous propo&s;al, and the monks found means to admit his troops into the i&s;land, &s;o as to &s;urprize the be&s;ieged. Hereward, finding him&s;elf betrayed, cut his pa&s;&s;age through the Norman troops, &s;word in hand; but the re&s;t were obliged to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion. Some were puni&s;hed with the lo&s;s of their eyes, others had their hands cut off, and a few were committed to clo&s;e pri&s;on; among the&s;e la&s;t was Morcar and Egelwin, bi&s;hop of Durham, though the lat|ter, for having excommunicated the king, was afterwards &s;tarved to death at Abingdon. The monks them&s;elves did not e&s;cape unpuni&s;hed, notwith&s;tanding<NOTE PLACE="marg">Paris. Mart$. Hoved. Orderic.</NOTE> the capitulation they had obtained.

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, Malcolm ravaged the northern provinces with great barbarity, pillaging, burning, and de&s;troying the open towns and vil|lages,

and butchering, without di&s;tinction of age or &s;ex, all tho&s;e mi&s;erable wretches whom he deemed unfit for the purpo&s;es of &s;lavery. Go&s;patric, gover|nor of Northumberland, finding him&s;elf too weak to oppo&s;e the progre&s;s of Malcolm by giving him battle, endeavoured to make a diver&s;ion by entering the kingdom of Cumberland, in which he committed the like exce&s;&s;es; &s;o that they &s;eemed to vye with each other in acts of cruelty and depredation. William, alarmed at the&s;e ho&s;tilities, had no &s;ooner quelled the revolt at Ely, than he began his march for Scotland, whither Malcolm had, by this time, retired with a pro|digious booty. After the Engli&s;h army had &s;u&s;tained incredible fatigues in &s;uch a long and trouble&s;ome march, the king arrived on the borders, and advancing into Northumberland, found Malcolm in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a very advantageous po&s;t, from whence he could not attempt to di&s;lodge him, without incurring the mo&s;t imminent danger. William therefore incamped in his neighbourhood; and the two armies lay facing one another for &s;everal days, during which both generals &s;eemed unwilling to begin a battle, which, in all probability would be attended with the mo&s;t important con&s;equences, ina&s;much as they were pretty equally matched in courage, number, and di&s;cipline. The&s;e con&s;iderations produced a treaty, for the performance of which ho&s;tages were given by Malcolm, who like|wi&s;e<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$$. Sax. Ing$lph.</NOTE> did homage for his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Cumberland. Neverthele&s;s, in his re|turn through that county, he fortified Carlile for his own u&s;e; and be&s;towed the earldom of Northumberland upon Waltheof, after having taken it from Go&s;pa|tric, on pretence of his having carried on a corre&s;pondence with the rebels; that nobleman, thus deprived of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, retired to Scotland, where Malcolm cre|ated him earl of Dunbar. Edgar Atheling, in con&s;equence of the treaty concluded between England and Scotland, renounced his claim to the throne, and in the cour&s;e of the en&s;uing year repaired to Normandy, where he was graciou&s;ly received and re&s;tored to his honours by the king, who &s;ettled upon him a mark per diem for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; though &s;uch was the &s;implicity of this darling of the Engli&s;h, that he afterwards re&s;igned his pen&s;ion for a fine hor&s;e belonging to William,<NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

<P>Philip, king of France, who envied the pro&s;perity of William, and became jealous of the power of &s;uch a formidable va&s;&s;al, re&s;olved to cooperate with the Engli&s;h malecontents, in hope of &s;eeing the conqueror &s;till expelled from his new kingdom. During the&s;e troubles, he invaded Normandy, even without a previous declaration of war; at the &s;ame time Fulk, count of Anjou, &s;pi|rited up a revolt in the county of Le Maine, which William had formerly annexed to his dominions; the town and citadel of Le Mans was taken, and the Normans driven out of the country. To quell the&s;e commotions, the conquerer rai&s;ed an army of Engli&s;h, amounting to fifty thou&s;and, and leaving his own countrymen to guard the kingdom, landed with the others in Normandy. The&s;e being joined by a reinforcement of Normans, he took the field again&s;t the French and the revolters, and having reduced the province of Le Maine, and gained &s;everal advantages over the enemy, Philip thought proper to make advances towards an<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann.

While William re&s;ided in Normandy, Gregory VII. otherwi&s;e known by the name of Hildebrand, the mo&s;t in&s;olent pontiff that ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;ee of Rome, &s;ummoned him by a nuncio to do homage for the kingdom of England, as a fief of the Roman &s;ee, and to pay up the arrears of rome&s;cot or St. Peter's penny, which had been
<PB N="231" REF="2400">
for &s;ome years neglected. To this peremptory demand William replied that he held<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1073.</NOTE> his crown of God only and his own &s;word; and when the nuncio threatened him with the cen&s;ures of the church, he publi&s;hed an edict forbidding all his &s;ubjects to acknowledge any pope but &s;uch as he &s;hould approve, or receive any order from Rome without his permi&s;&s;ion. This re&s;olute behaviour gave Gregory to under&s;tand, that the Norman was not a prince to be intimidated by eccle&s;ia&s;tical thunder; and therefore he de&s;i&s;ted from his preten&s;ions, upon William's promi&s;|ing to pay the arrears that were due. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Eadmer.

<P>The king's long ab&s;ence gave ri&s;e to a con&s;piracy in England, hatch|ed by per&s;ons whom he lea&s;t of all &s;u&s;pected of di&s;affection. Roger the younger &s;on of Willian Fitzo&s;bern, who &s;ucceeded to the Engli&s;h e&s;tate and earldom of Hereford, had either by way of compliment to his &s;overeign, or in compliance with &s;ome obligation of the feudal law, &s;ollicited William's con&s;ent to the mar|riage of his &s;i&s;ter with Ralph de Guair, earl of the Ea&s;t-Angles. This favour was reque&s;ted, and flatly refu&s;ed by the king before his departure from England; but as the parties had agreed upon the articles, the ceremony was performed, and the nuptials were &s;olemnized with great magnificence at Exning in Suffolk, where a great number of barons, bi&s;hops, and military officers, were a&s;&s;embled on this occa&s;ion, and among the re&s;t Waltheof, the new created earl of Northumberland. As the parents of the new-married couple were well ac|quainted with the character of William, who would never forgive this tran&s;|action, undertaken in direct oppo&s;ition to his will, they took the opportu|nity, while the gue&s;ts were warmed with wine, to introduce that &s;ubject of conver&s;ation; they inveighed again&s;t the &s;everity of William's government; they ob&s;erved that, by means of his exce&s;&s;ive impo&s;itions, he took away with one hand what he had given with the other; that this tyranny extended even to their dome&s;tic affairs, &s;eeing he controuled them in the di&s;po&s;al of their &s;i&s;ters and daughters. They affected to expre&s;s compa&s;&s;ion for the Engli&s;h nation, which he had &s;o cruelly in&s;laved; they inveighed again&s;t the re&s;erve and haughtine&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition; and la&s;tly, expatiated upon the di&s;grace of being &s;ubjected to the arbitrary power of a ba&s;tard and u&s;urper. By the&s;e in&s;inuations the gue&s;ts, al|ready intoxicated with the fumes of the entertainment, were inflamed to &s;uch a degree of temerity, that they unanimou&s;y re&s;olved to take arms and oppo&s;e the king's return; and in the mean time determined to &s;ollicit the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Swein, king of Denmark, the profe&s;&s;ed and inveterate enemy of the Norman. Next day, when Waltheof began to reflect cooly upon the danger in which he had em$arked, he plainly perceived that whatever &s;hould happen, he mu&s;t be a lo&s;er, becau&s;e he and his country would &s;uffer by the change of one arbitrary monarch for a number of petty tyrants, in ca&s;e they &s;hould &s;ucceed; and he being the only Engli&s;hman engaged in the con&s;piracy, would be the chief aim of William's ven|geance, provided their &s;cheme &s;hould mi&s;carry, as he could not help thinking it would; be&s;ides, he was influenced on this occa&s;ion by motives of gratitude to the king, who had honoured him with particular marks of confidence and favour.</P>

<P>In con&s;equence of tho&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions, he communicated the particulars of the con&s;piracy to Lanfranc, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury; and, by the advice of that prelate, took &s;hipping immediately for Normandy, where he made a full di&s;covery of the plot to the king, and met with a gracious reception. William, though he had not yet intirely appea&s;ed the troubles of his hereditary dominions, no &s;ooner $$$$ived this intelligence than he &s;et &s;ail for England, where he found the di&s;|turbance

already &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the diligence of his brother Odo, whom he had left regent of the kingdom. The two chiefs of the con&s;piracy had taken the field with their followers, as &s;oon as Waltheof di&s;appeared. Roger attempted to cro&s;s the Severne, but was prevented by Wul&s;tan, bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, and Ur$o, high-&s;heriff of the county. Ralph advanced into the neighbourhood of Cambridge, and being defeated at Fagadun by Odo, and Geoffry the ju&s;ticiary, the right foot of every pri&s;oner was cut off by way of puni&s;hment. He him&s;elf e&s;caped to his ca&s;tle at Norwich$ which was immediately inve&s;ted; but de&s;pair|ing of pardon, in ca&s;e he &s;hould fall into the king's hand, he found means to &s;teal away into Denmark.

<P>William, on his return to England, had forfeited this nobleman's honours and e&s;tate in England; and condemned Roger$ earl of Hereford, his own kin&s;man, to clo&s;e impri&s;onment. The re&s;t of the con&s;pirators were either hanged, blinded, or deprived of their hands: but the fate of Waltheof was univer&s;ally regretted. Notwith&s;tanding the candour with which this noble earl had acted in this affair, and the interce&s;&s;ion of Lanfranc, who plead|ed his cau&s;e with the king, he was brought to his trial, upon the information of his own wife Judith; and being an Engli&s;hman po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a great for|tune, and qualities that excited the jealou&s;y of the Conqueror, he was convict|ed of trea&s;on, and privately beheaded without the walls of Winche&s;ter. His body was at fir&s;t thrown ignominiou&s;ly into a ditch, where it lay a fortnight, flightly covered with earth, and was then removed to the chapter-hou&s;e, at Croy|land, where it was honourably interred. This was the la&s;t Engli&s;hman who main|tained<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1075.</NOTE> any con&s;iderable power or influence in the nation.

<P>The Conqueror having re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the peace of his government, and extingui&s;hed the la&s;t embers of rebellion with blood, cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea again, in order to execute his vengeance upon Ralph de Guair, again&s;t whom he marched into Bretagne, and be$$eged the city of Dal, which, however, he could not reduce, before the king of France &s;ent forces to its relief.

<P>Immediately after the con&s;ummation of this marriage he returned to England, where nothing remarkable happened; and he now &s;eemed to enjoy &s;ome repo&s;e from the ince&s;&s;ant troubles that had hitherto agitated his reign, when, all of a &s;udden, he was involved in family-di&s;quiets. His elde&s;t &s;on Ro|bert, &s;urnamed, from his &s;hort legs, Gambaron, or Courtes-hu&s;es, had called upon his father, after the conque&s;t of England, to perform the promi&s;e he had made, to leave him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Normandy, as &s;oon as the conqueror him|&s;elf &s;hould be ma&s;ter of this kingdom. This promi&s;e he had made in the French council, while he was in Paris &s;olliciting &s;uccours for his expedition from Philip; and afterwards, in a dangerous fit of illne&s;s, he renewed the promi&s;e, declared Robert heir to his hereditary dominions, and as &s;uch the barons of Nor|mandy and Main did him homage. After having been crowned king of Eng|land, he had delayed performance, on pretence of the numerous revolts among the Engli&s;h, and the inva&s;ions with which he was threatened by the Scots and Danes; but all the&s;e objections being removed, and the kingdom totall# reduc|ed to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, when Robert reminded him of his promi&s;e, he flatly told him he would not undre&s;s him&s;elf before he went to bed; and therefore he mu&s;t wait till his decea&s;e. The &s;on, though ambitious, brave, and enterpri&s;ing, maintained &s;uch filial re&s;pect for his father, that, perhaps, he would have taken no &s;$ep to di&s;turb his tranquility, had not he been in&s;tigated by Ivo and Alberic, &s;ons of Hugh de Grente Me&s;nil, who, having been deprived of their father's Engli&s;h honours and e&s;tate, were enemies to the conqueror, and let &s;lip no opportunity to kindle a di&s;&s;en&s;ion between him and his elde&s;t &s;on. They repre&s;ented to Ro|bert, who&s;e temper, though mild, was yet inflammable, that his father's refu&s;al was not only an injury, but a flagrant affront; and that his intention was to &s;hare his Norman dominions between his other two &s;ons, William Rufus and Henry$ who had engro&s;&s;ed his whole favour. At the very time, while his mind was irritated by this remon&s;trance, his brothers happened, whether by accident or de&s;ign, to behave rudely in his pre&s;ence, and be&s;prinkled him with &s;ome wa|ter, which they pretended to throw at one another in je&s;t. This boyi&s;h in&s;ult provoked Robert to &s;uch a degree, that he drew his &s;word, and mi&s;chief would have en&s;ued, had not the father, who was in the neighbourhood, immediately interpo&s;ed. But, he could not allay the animo&s;ity, which from this moment pre|vailed in his family. Robert and his confederates withdrew to Rouen, in the middle of the night, hoping to &s;urpri&s;e the ca&s;tle; but his de&s;ign was defeated by Roger de Ivry the governor. Thus the flame broke out, and the young Nor|man nobility in general declared for Robert; while the king took mea&s;ures for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the in&s;urrection, by giving orders to &s;eize and puni&s;h all the parti|&s;ans of his rebellious &s;on, &s;ome of whom were apprehended and impri&s;oned, and the re&s;t, who fled, were deprived of their e&s;tates. The nobility of Bretagne, Anjou, and Maine, intere&s;ted them&s;elves in this quarrel, &s;ome declaring for the &s;on, and others adhering to the father, and a &s;ort of piratical war was maintain|ed three or four years, with &s;ome intervals of accommodation. It was in one of the&s;e that William cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea to England; and in his ab&s;ence ho&s;tilities
<PB N="234" REF="2430">
were renewed in Normandy. Philip, king of France, envying the power and glory of William, fomented the divi&s;ion in &s;ecret, encouraged Robert with magnificent promi&s;es of &s;upport, and in the mean time, a&s;&s;i&s;ted him with the means to keep the war alive; Robert likewi&s;e received private &s;upplies from his own mother, who&s;e favourite he was, and he found other re&s;ources in the friend|&s;hip of the Norman lords, by whom he was exceedingly beloved.</P>

<P>William, not a little anxious and perplexed by the&s;e dome&s;tic trou|bles, levied a &s;trong army of Engli&s;h, and tran&s;por$ed it to Normandy, where Robert being in no condition to with&s;tand &s;uch a reinforcement, added to the Normans, who &s;till e&s;pou&s;ed his father's cau&s;e, he demanded a &s;afe retreat of Philip, who, being unwilling to engage him&s;elf openly in a war with the king of Eng|land, prevailed upon the Vidame Hel$e, to admit him into Gerberoy, a &s;trong fortre&s;s in the Beauvoi&s;is. In this place Robert was joined by a great number of French noblemen, who went thither, with their va&s;&s;als, to &s;ignalize their cou|rage under the command of a prince who was counted one of the be&s;t &s;oldiers of his time, and from thence they ravaged all the Vexin Norman and the Pais de Caux.</P>
<P>With a view to &s;top the&s;e incur&s;ions, William began his march in the depth of winter, and inve&s;ted Gerberoy, the &s;iege of which he carried on with vigour about three weeks, during which many &s;allies were made, and a number of &s;ignal adventures in chivalry atchieved. In one of tho&s;e actions, Robert perceiving an officer of the Engli&s;h army, fighting on hor&s;eback with remarkable prowe&s;s and impetuo&s;ity, ran at him with his lance, wounded and di&s;mounted him at the fir&s;t encounter. The next blow would, in all probability, have put an end to his life, had not the vanqui&s;hed cavalier lifted up his beaver, and di&s;played the individual countenance of his own father. Robert, &s;hocked at this outrage which he had unknowingly committed again&s;t the laws of nature, immediately fell upon his knees, craved pardon with tears in his eyes, and remounted his father with his own hands; William, &s;tung with &s;hame and indignation, in&s;tead o$ granting the pardon he reque&s;ted, is &s;aid to have cur&s;ed him with great bit|terne&s;s. Be that as it will, he forthwith rai&s;ed the &s;iege, and returned to Rouen, where he was prevailed upon by the importunities of his queen, &s;econded by<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ H$v$d. $word$ $word$</NOTE> Roger, earl of Shrew&s;bury, and &s;ome Norman barons, to be reconciled to his rebellious &s;on, whom, however, he would not tru&s;t in Normandy after his de|parture, but brought him over to England on pretence of &s;ending him to com|mand an army again&s;t the Scots, who had by this time invaded England.</P>

The Scots having &s;ucceeded &s;o well in their fir&s;t incur&s;ion, were encouraged to repeat the inva&s;ion, e&s;pecially as the whole county of Northumberland was involved in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion and di&s;cord, occa|&s;ioned originally by the murder of Walcher, bi&s;hop of Durham. This prelate had, at the death of Waltheof, purcha&s;ed the earldom of Northumberland of the king; and being a man of an ea&s;y, indolent di&s;po&s;ition, &s;uffered his officers to oppre$s the people: he was chiefly governed by Leofwine, his chaplain, and Gi|&s;elbert, his kin&s;man and deputy, who, among other outrages, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated Le|gulph, a wi&s;e, devout, and charitable nobleman, who had often advi&s;ed the

bi&s;hop to di&s;card &s;uch evil coun&s;ellors. Walcher was extremely concerned at the murder of a per&s;on whom he e&s;teemed &s;o much; but the perpetrators of it had gained &s;uch an a&s;cendancy over him, that in&s;tead of &s;urrendering them to ju&s;tice, he endeavoured to compound the matter by making &s;ome &s;atisfaction to the relations of the decea&s;ed. With that view he appeared at a county-court held at Gate&s;head; where the people were &s;o incen&s;ed at his attempt to &s;creen &s;uch atro|cious murderers and oppre&s;&s;ors, that they fell upon them without form of tri|al, and hewed them in pieces; then turned their &s;words again&s;t the bi&s;hop, who was &s;lain with all his followers. Thus arou&s;ed, they marched to Durham, and inve&s;ted the ca&s;tle; but, in a few days, were obliged to rai&s;e the &s;iege, by<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1080. Flor. Wig.

Neverthele&s;s, he ordered all tho&s;e who were in any &s;hape acce&s;|&s;ary to the revolt, to be put to death, deprived of their hands, or mulcted in large &s;ums of money: he de&s;olated the whole country, robbed the church of all its rich ornaments, and left a &s;trong garri&s;on in the ca&s;tle. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sim.

<P>Having taken the&s;e mea&s;ures to gratify his avarice, his next care was to indulge another pa&s;&s;ion no le&s;s pernicious to his &s;ubjects. He loved the chace with &s;uch fury of de&s;ire, that he depopulated the country in Hamp&s;hire, to the extent of thirty miles; turning out the inhabitants, de&s;troying all the villages, hou&s;es, plantations, and even churches, that &s;tood within that tract, which was re&s;erved for the habitation of wild bea&s;ts, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the New Fore&s;t. In the time of the Saxon kings, all noblemen with|out di&s;tinction, had a right to enjoy this diver&s;ion in countries and fore&s;ts where the game abounded: but William, either with a view to gratify his own pa&s;&s;ion for hunting, without participation, or in hope of rai&s;ing money from tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, appropriated all tho&s;e fore&s;ts to him&s;elf, and publi&s;hed very &s;evere laws<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">A per&s;on convicted of having killed a deer, hare, or wild boar, was puni&s;hed with the lo&s;s of his eyes: whereas he might have atoned for murder, by a moderate fine.</NOTE> to prohibit his &s;ubjects from encroaching upon this part of h$$ prerogative.

But he paid very little regard to their murmurs, while he derived &s;uch advantages from their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; for they were &s;o much addicted to hunting, that they cho&s;e to undergo all the pecuniary penalties, rather than be deprived of that ex|erci&s;e.</P>

<P>This was one of the few in&s;tances, in which he made no difference between Saxon and Norman. In other re&s;pects, his partiality for his native coun|try &s;eemed every day to increa&s;e. Though he could not, with any decency, abo|li&s;h the laws that were a&s;cribed to his old friend Edward the Confe&s;&s;or, he in|troduced divers alterations in the manner of admini&s;tering ju&s;tice. He prohi|bited the bi&s;hops from a&s;&s;i&s;ting as u&s;ual at county-courts, or &s;hire-gemots, and a&s;&s;igned to them a &s;eparate tribunal, on pretence of di&s;tingui&s;hing between ci|vil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs; but in reality with a view to deprive the prelates of their &s;hare of the mulcts and amerciaments. He in&s;tituted new tribunals, &s;ome of which were ambulatory and followed the court, to the great inconvenience of the parties; and in the&s;e courts the proceedings were carried on in the Norman lan|guage, for the attainment of which he erected &s;chools in all the towns and bur|roughs of the kingdom, commanding all parents to &s;end their children to the&s;e &s;eminaries, under &s;evere penalties. He ordered the laws to be publi&s;hed in the Norman tongue; and at court no other was ever heard. William's intention was to &s;upplant the Saxon with his own vernacular language; but all his efforts mi&s;carried; the mixture of the two produced a third, which was different from either, and yet had affinity with both. The Engli&s;h were not only robbed of

<P>Odo, bi&s;hop of Bayeux, the king's uterine brother, after having re|&s;ided fifteen or &s;ixteen years in England, ama&s;&s;ed &s;o much trea&s;ure that he re|&s;olved to purcha&s;e the papacy. In the mean time he bought a &s;umptuous pa|lace at Rome, in which he propo&s;ed to live till the death of the pre&s;ent incum|bent, that he might be at hand to &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. He took all his mea|&s;ures with the utmo&s;t &s;ecrecy, and even per&s;uaded Hugh, earl of Che&s;ter, to|gether with a great number of his adherents and tenants, to follow him into Italy, where he would improve their fortunes under the &s;hadow of St. Peter's chair. Having concerted all his mea&s;ures for the execution of this project, he took the opportunity of the king's ab&s;ence to equip a ve&s;&s;el at the I&s;le of Wight, where he propo&s;ed to embark: but while he was detained by contrary winds, William received intimation of his de&s;ign, and re&s;olving to prevent the exportation of &s;o much trea&s;ure from his dominions, cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea in per&s;on, and &s;urpri&s;ed him ju&s;t as he was &s;tepping on board: when he ordered his atten|dants to arre&s;t Odo, they were afraid of attaching the per&s;on of a prelate; &s;o that William was obliged to &s;eize him with his own hand. Odo appealed to the pope, who, he &s;aid, was the only per&s;on upon earth, who had power to try a bi&s;hop; and the king replied, that he did not &s;eize him as bi&s;hop of Bayeux, but as earl of Kent, in which capacity he &s;hould give an account of his admi|ni&s;tration. Mean while he confi&s;cated his effects, and ordered him to be tran&s;|ported to Normandy, and impri&s;oned in the ca&s;tle of Rouen, where he remain|ed till the death of the conqueror, notwith&s;tanding all the efforts of pope Gre|gory, who &s;oothed and threatened William by turns in his behalf. <NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>Immediately after this tran&s;action, William lo&s;t his queen Mathilda, who died of a lingering di&s;order, after having been his con&s;ort three and thirty years; and he was &s;o exceedingly afflicted at her death, that he ever after ab|&s;tained from his u&s;ual recreations. In the mid&s;t of his &s;orrow at this event, he was alarmed by an in&s;urrection in Le Maine, the nobility of which had been al|ways aver&s;e to the Norman government. Hubert vicomte de Beaumont, di&s;gu&s;t|ed by &s;ome treatment he had received from the conqueror, retired to his ca&s;tle of Su&s;anne, which, in tho&s;e days, was counted impregnable, and from thence made incur&s;ions into Le Maine, ravaging the country and &s;urpri&s;ing de|tached parties of the Norman garri&s;ons. The king marched immediately to his fortre&s;s, which he found &s;o &s;trong, that he did not think proper to be&s;iege it in+form; but erected a fort in the neighbourhood, in which he left a garri&s;on, to check the vi&s;count's incur&s;ions, under the command of his &s;on-in-law Alain Fregnant, who was at fir&s;t &s;uperior to the enemy. Hubert, however, in the &s;equel, was joined with &s;uch a number of friends and allies from France and Burgundy, as enabled him to in&s;ult the Normans at the very gate of their fort, and maintain the war for three years, during which he obtained &s;everal advan|tages over William's troops, and at length obtained a complete victory. The king finding it impracticable to reduce him by force, offered to be reconciled to him if he would return to his duty; and Hubert, being furni&s;hed with a &s;afe conduct, repaired to England, where he was graciou&s;ly received by the Con|queror, who re-e&s;tabli&s;hed him in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all his father's e&s;tate. <NOTE PLACE="marg">O d.

<P>Perhaps this war would not have continued &s;o long had not William's pre&s;ence been nece&s;&s;ary in England, to provide again&s;t an inva&s;ion with which he was threatened by the king of Denmark. The Engli&s;h refugees in that country had a&s;&s;ured Canute, that their countrymen wanted nothing but an op|portunity to &s;hake off the Norman yoke; and that prince believed this was a fa|vourable conjuncture for the conque&s;t of England, to the crown of which he had &s;ome preten&s;ions. He therefore equipped a powerful armament, and Wil|liam being apprized of his de&s;ign, brought over an army of foreigners from the continent, becau&s;e he could not confide in the fidelity of his Engli&s;h &s;ubjects. At the &s;ame time he impo&s;ed a tax of &s;ix &s;hillings upon every hide of land, which was three times the amount of the ordinary Danegelt, and &s;uppo&s;ing the Danes would make their de&s;cent in the north, he ordered the whole province of Northumberland to be laid wa&s;te, that they might find no &s;ub&s;i&s;tance at their arrival. Canute being informed of the&s;e precautions, de&s;i&s;ted from his enter|prize; and William hearing he had laid a&s;ide the de&s;ign, di&s;banded his forces: but the money rai&s;ed for their maintenance was never re&s;tored. On the contra|ry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$. Ch. 1$84. G. Malme&s;h. R$g. de H$v$d.</NOTE> he levied a new tax on occa&s;ion of knighting his younge&s;t &s;on Henry, in imitation of an e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;tom in Normandy, where a pre&s;ent was always made to the father when the &s;on received the order of knighthood.</P>

<P>William found no difficulty in &s;addling his &s;ubjects with any in|cumbrances they could bear: he was now as ab&s;olute as a Per&s;ian emperor; and had nothing to do but &s;peak and be obeyed. The Normans knew their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions depended entirely upon his plea&s;ure; and the Engli&s;h were &s;o effectu|ally cru&s;hed, that almo&s;t every nobleman of that nation was executed, impri|&s;oned, or exiled. Tho&s;e very few who &s;till breathed their native air, and en|joyed habitations of their own, were &s;o much expo&s;ed to the watchful jealou&s;y of the king, that their liberty and lives exi&s;ted on the mo&s;t precarious tenure. Edgar Atheling, though there was nothing formidable in his talents, and nothing enterpri&s;ing in his genius, was &s;till the object of William's fear and &s;u&s;picion, becau&s;e he &s;aw that prince, even in the low &s;tate of dependency to which he had reduced him, care&s;&s;ed by his &s;ubjects, on account of his birth, as well as of the amiable qualities of his mind and per&s;on. Edgar, with the &s;mall &s;hare of di&s;cernment he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, could plainly perceive the dangerous predicament in which he &s;tood, and therefore de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to go and &s;erve as a vo|lunteer again&s;t the infidels in Pale&s;tine. Nothing could be more agreeable than this reque&s;t to the conqueror, who not only applauded his zeal for the chri&s;tian religion, but &s;upplied him with money to defray the expence of his voyage; and he departed without delay, accompanied by two hundred Engli&s;h gentlemen, who, having lo&s;t their e&s;tates in England, re&s;olved to try their<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wal&s;ingham.</NOTE> fortune abroad.</P>

<P>William being thus rid of all apprehen&s;ion of rival&s;hip, and &s;till eager to augment his own power and territory, revived the preten&s;ions he had to the Vexin Francois, which had been ceded to his father by Henry, king of France, as a recompence for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he had granted to that prince in his di&s;tre&s;&s;es. When the Duke of Normandy died in the Holy land, Philip, the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Henry, took advantage of William's minority, and the troubles which broke out in Normandy, to &s;eize and appropriate to him&s;elf this territory, which the hurry of the conqueror's more intere&s;ting affairs had hither|to
<PB N="239" REF="2480">
hindered him to reclaim. Perhaps as he was now in the decline of life, and much incommoded by corpulency, he might have allowed his title to lie dor|mant for the re&s;t of his reign, had it not been rou&s;ed by &s;everal petty inci|dents, which irritated the two monarchs again&s;t each other. Henry, the younge&s;t &s;on of the conqueror, is &s;aid to have quarrelled at che&s;s with Lewis &s;urnamed the Gro&s;s, Philip's elde&s;t &s;on, whom he wounded with the board, during a vi&s;it to the French king, who then re&s;ided at Confians St. Honorine, from whence Henry and his brother e&s;caped by the &s;wiftne&s;s of their hor&s;es. Philip re&s;ented this violence, though his own &s;on had been the aggre&s;&s;or, and ordered his troops in garri&s;on at Mante to cro&s;s the Eure and ravage Norman|dy: &s;o that William re&s;olved to retort the&s;e depredations; but, in the mean time, he began, by the advice of his phy&s;icians, to undergo a cour&s;e of medicines for the reduction of his unwieldy bulk. Philip, being made acquainted with this circum&s;tance, &s;coffingly a&s;ked one day in public, if the good woman of England was &s;till in the &s;traw: and this &s;arca&s;m being reported to William, he &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the French king, giving him notice that he would &s;oon be a-foot; and at his churching pre&s;ent him with &s;uch a number of lights <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Alluding to the cu&s;tom of tho&s;e days, in which women pre&s;ented wax tapers at the al|tar, upon their being churched after lying|in.</NOTE>, as would make his kingdom too hot for his re&s;idence.</P>

<P>In order to perform this promi&s;e, he levied a &s;trong army, and enter|ing the I&s;le of France, de&s;troyed and burned all the villages and hou&s;es without oppo&s;ition: then inve&s;ting Mante, which he took by a&s;&s;ault, the town was plun|dered, and with all the churches and mona&s;teries reduced to a&s;hes. Before the flames were extingui&s;hed William entered in triumph, and his hor&s;e chancing to place his forefeet on &s;ome hot a&s;hes, plunged with &s;uch violence, that the ri|der was thrown forward, and brui&s;ed upon the pummel of the &s;addle to &s;uch a<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. Malme&s;h. Ord. Vital. An. Ch. 1086.</NOTE> degree, that he &s;uffered a relap&s;e, and was obliged to return to Rouen. There he was attended by Gilbert, bi&s;hop of Ly&s;ieux, and Goulard, abbot of Jumi|eges, the mo&s;t &s;kilful phy&s;icians of the time; but notwith&s;tanding all their en|deavours, his di&s;temper gained ground; and they at la&s;t gave him to un|der&s;tand that his end approached. Finding he could no longer enjoy the fruits of his u&s;urpation, he re&s;olved to compound with heaven for all the blood he had &s;hed, and the inju&s;tice he had committed; and di&s;tributed great part of the trea&s;ure he had ama&s;&s;ed, in alms to the poor, and benefac|tions to churches and mona&s;teries, particularly to tho&s;e of Mante, which he had &s;o lately de&s;troyed. Then he &s;ettled his la&s;t will, in which he bequeath|ed Normandy and Le Maine, to his elde&s;t &s;on Robert, whom he hated; but he &s;aw there was no other method to pre&s;erve the peace of his hereditary domi|nions. To Henry he left five thou&s;and pounds &s;terling and his mother's join|ture, without one acre of territory; and though he would not pretend to e&s;ta|bli&s;h the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of England, which he had u&s;urped and oppre&s;&s;ed in &s;uch a cruel manner, he expre&s;&s;ed his wi&s;h that the crown might devolve to his favour|ite &s;on William, whom he immediately di&s;patched with letters to archbi&s;hop Lanfranc, &s;olliciting that prelate's intere&s;t in his behalf. To the abbey of St. Stephen at Caen, he pre&s;ented his crown and &s;ceptre, the precious &s;tone cha|lice, the golden candle&s;tics and other regalia u&s;ed at his coronation; and gave
<PB N="240" REF="2490">
order for relea&s;ing the earls Morcar, Roger, Siward &s;on of Beorn, and Wulnoth brother to Harold, who had been an ho&s;tage and pri&s;oner &s;ince the reign of Ed|ward the Confe&s;&s;or. He was not &s;o favourably inclined towards Odo, bi&s;hop of Bayeux; for when his brother, count of Mortain, interceded in his behalf, William ob&s;erved, that he &s;hould do an inju&s;tice to mankind, in &s;etting at li|berty that prelate, whom he knew to be a turbulent, ambitious churchman, cruel, vindictive, profligate, and rapacious: neverthele&s;s, he yielded to Robert's importunities, and ordered the bi&s;hop to be enlarged, though he progno&s;ticated abundance of mi&s;chief as the con&s;equence of his liberty. The conqueror, when he had thus regulated his temporal affairs, was conveyed in a litter to Hermentrude, a village near Rouen, where he might &s;ettle the concerns of his<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch. 1087.</NOTE> &s;oul without noi&s;e or di&s;turbance; and there he re&s;igned his breath, in the &s;ixty|fir&s;t year of his age, after having reigned two and fifty in Normandy, and one and twenty in England.</P>

<P>His body was depo&s;ited in a church at Caen, which he him&s;elf had founded; and, his two elder &s;ons being ab&s;ent, Henry &s;uperintended the funeral, which was far from being magnificent, and attended with a very remarkable incident. The corps being carried into the church of St. Stephen, and the &s;ervice begun, one A&s;celin Fitz-Arthur, a Vava&s;or, pre&s;&s;ing through the crowd, and &s;tanding upon a high &s;tone, called with a loud voice to the prelates that were in attendance, forbidding them to inter the body in that place, which was the area of his father's hou&s;e, unju&s;tly &s;eized by the conqueror, whom he now &s;um|moned before the divine tribunal to an&s;wer for that act of oppre&s;&s;ion.

<P>WILLIAM RUFUS was overtaken by the news of his father's death, while he waited for a favourable wind at Wit&s;and; but this event he thought proper to conceal in England, until he had taken mea&s;ures for &s;ecuring the crown. Perhaps he might have found more difficulty in a&s;cend|ing the throne, had Robert been pre&s;ent to avail him&s;elf of his right of primo|geniture; for William was hated both by Normans and Engli&s;h, on account of his ferocious di&s;po&s;ition. However, he owed his &s;udden elevation to the credit of Lanfranc, and the attachment of Eudes, high trea&s;urer, who not on|ly made &s;ure of Dover, Winche&s;ter, Peven&s;ey, Ha&s;tings, and other fortified places, but al&s;o delivered into his hands the riches of the Conqueror, amounting to &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling in money, be&s;ides plate and jewels to a great value. Part of this trea&s;ure he di&s;tributed among the churches and mona&s;teries, according to the late king's intention and devi&s;al, in order to attach the clergy<NOTE PLACE="marg">Daniel. Brcmpton. Hoved. E$$mer.</NOTE> to his intere&s;t, and part he be&s;towed in large&s;&s;es upon the &s;oldiery. As it was found nece&s;&s;ary to anticipate any de&s;igns that might be formed by Robert's par|ti&s;ans, the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury exerted all his influence in favour of Wil|liam, and having previou&s;ly &s;ounded the individuals, a&s;&s;embled the majority of the bi&s;hops and nobility at We&s;tmin&s;ter, where the ceremony of his coronation
<PB N="243" REF="2520">
was performed, about eighteen days after his father's death. In the beginning of his reign, the Engli&s;h nation began to believe them&s;elves happily di&s;ap|pointed in their expectation of Rufus, who had hitherto di&s;covered a mo&s;t bru|tal di&s;po&s;ition; for he now &s;eemed to pay the utmo&s;t regard to the councils of Lanfranc, which were mild and whole&s;ome, and altogether calculated for the advantage of the nation. This conduct however was no more than a cloak, with which he di&s;gui&s;ed, for the pre&s;ent, all the bad qualities of his father, which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed without any of his virtues, except courage, if a &s;avage ferocity de&s;erves that appellation.</P>

<P>Robert received the tidings of his father's decea&s;e at Abbeville, from whence he forthwith repaired to Rouen, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Normandy with|out oppo&s;ition. This prince was the rever&s;e of William in every thing but courage, in which and military capacity he yielded to no warrior of his time. He was open, generous, and humane, even to an exce&s;s that became criminal and pernicious; for he impoveri&s;hed him&s;elf to gratify the avarice of his adhe|rents, and be&s;towed the mo&s;t con&s;iderable governments of the province upon noblemen who&s;e fidelity he had rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect. Morcard and Ulnoth, whom Henry had detained in pri&s;on, notwith&s;tanding the Conqueror's orders, Robert immediately enlarged, together with Duncan, the natural &s;on of Malcolm, king of Scotland, who had been taken in the cour&s;e of the war between the two nations.</P>

<P>Odo, bi&s;hop of Bayeux, became his chief coun&s;ellor; but not con|tented with the favour of the duke of Normandy, he repaired to England, in or|der to &s;ollicit the re&s;titution of his e&s;tate in that country, which William had confi&s;cated. He not only &s;ucceeded in this &s;uit, but al&s;o ingratiated him&s;elf with William Rufus, whom, he neverthele&s;s, re&s;olved to depo&s;e. He took um|brage at the credit of Lanfranc, whom he mortally hated for having advi&s;ed the Conqueror to prevent his journey to Rome; and he longed to rai&s;e Robert to the throne of England, becau&s;e in this event he laid his account with being prime mini&s;ter. He communicated his de&s;ign to &s;ome Norman lords, who had e&s;tates upon the continent as well as in England, and thought they held them on a very precarious tenure under different &s;overeigns, whereas an union of the two countries under one king would &s;ecure their property in both. This con&s;idera|tion, added to the right of primogeniture and the liberality of Robert, ea&s;ily determined them in his favour; while the Engli&s;h noblemen, who were &s;o de|pre&s;&s;ed and de&s;perate in their fortunes, &s;aw nothing but advantage to them&s;elves in &s;uch a change; and therefore willingly engaged in the con&s;piracy. Odo's in|trigues being attended with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, he &s;ent an account of his negociation to Robert, a&s;&s;uring him that nothing was wanted but his pre&s;ence, and a body of Norman troops, for the recovery of the Engli&s;h crown, from which he had been &s;o unju&s;tly excluded. Robert was extremely well plea&s;ed with this intel|ligence, in con&s;equence of which he borrowed a &s;um of money from his brother Henry, on a mortgage of the Contantin; then a&s;&s;ured his uncle he would not fail to be in England with all expedition, and in the mean time de&s;ired he would prepare his friends for an open revolt. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Brompton.</NOTE></P>

the bi&s;hop of Coutance and his nephew Mowbray. Roger Bigod ro&s;e in Nor|folk; Hugh de Grente&s;me&s;nil made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the &s;trong places in Leice&s;ter&s;hire. The county of Worce&s;ter was occupied by Roger de Montgo|mery, William bi&s;hop of Durham, Bernard de Newarck, Roger Lacy, and Ralph Mortimer; and, in a word, &s;uch &s;teps were taken for Robert's intere&s;t in different parts of England, that in all probability William would have been dethroned, if Robert's indolence had not defeated all their mea&s;ures. That prince, in&s;tead of employing his money in levies to &s;upport his friends in Eng|land, &s;quandered it away in idle expence and unrequited benefits; and procra&s;ti|nated his departure until the opportunity was lo&s;t: while William exerted him|&s;elf with incredible activity to &s;ti$e the confederacy, before his elder brother could arrive.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; V.</HEAD>
<P>Lanfranc advi&s;ed him on this occa&s;ion to conciliate the affection of the Engli&s;h; and he accordingly amu&s;ed them with magnificent promi&s;es, to ea&s;e them of their burthen&s;ome tolls and taxes, and allow them free liberty of hunting. Cajoled by the&s;e profe&s;&s;ions, which were void of all &s;incerity, the Engli&s;h in general continued firmly attached to his intere&s;t, and the Londoners rai&s;ed an army of thirty thou&s;and men for his &s;ervice. All the prelates and clergy, influ|enced by the archbi&s;hop, adhered to his cau&s;e; and Lanfranc found means to detach &s;ome of the mo&s;t powerful con&s;pirators from the enterprize they had undertaken. So that, in a little time, Ru&s;us was enabled to &s;end a &s;trong &s;qua|dron of &s;hips to &s;ea, while he marched at the head of his Engli&s;h army, again&s;t his uncle Odo, who had fortified him&s;elf at Peven&s;ey, in hope of being relieved by the arrival of the duke of Normandy. The king inve&s;ted the place and carried on his attacks with &s;uch fury, that the bi&s;hop, afraid of its being taken by a&s;&s;ault, began in a few days to capitulate; but could obtain no terms, until he undertook to put William in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Roche&s;ter, to which the principal con&s;pirators had retired, under the command of Eu&s;tace, count of Boulogne. The bi&s;hop being conducted to the gate of Roche&s;ter, in order to per&s;uade the governor to &s;urrender, the count perceived in his countenance how much his heart was at variance with his tongue, and took him pri&s;oner without ceremony, as a traytor who had betrayed the confederates. William, thus baf|f$ed by the craft of the bi&s;hop, undertook the &s;iege of that city, which was &s;o<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch. 1088.</NOTE> vigorou&s;ly defended, that he began to de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s; when an infectious d$&s;temper having crept into the place, made &s;uch havoc among the garri&s;on, that the chiefs were fain to &s;urrender on condition of being allowed to retire with their hor&s;es only, though without any pro&s;pect of retrieving their forfeited e&s;tates. Odo found a welcome reception in Normandy, and governed that dutchy as prime mini&s;ter to Robert, who, in&s;tead of repairing into England with a &s;trong body of Norman forces, according to the original de&s;ign of this con$piracy, had indulged his natural &s;loth at Ro$en, and &s;ent over a &s;ingle ve&s;|&s;el<NOTE PLACE="marg">H$$. Hunt. R g $e Hov. Ord V$t$l.</NOTE> with a few &s;oldiers, who were all taken or drowned. After the reduction of Roche&s;ter, the king marched towards Durham, to cha&s;ti&s;e the bi&s;hop, who had embarked in the plot; and that city being immediately taken, the prelate was bani&s;hed, together with all tho&s;e who had taken up arms in the execution of this project.</P>

<P>The &s;uppre$$$on of this revolt confirmed the government of William Rufus, who, far from performing his promi&s;es to the Engli&s;h, by who&s;e valour
<PB N="245" REF="2540">
and fidelity his throne was e&s;tabli&s;hed, gave a loo&s;e to his arbitrary nature, which he had hitherto bridled, and loaded them with the mo&s;t grievous impo&s;itions. Nay, in the very article of hunting, in&s;tead of abating the rigour of the law, he made a new act, by which a man convicted of killing a deer was puni&s;hable with death; and introduced the method of lawing or maiming dogs, by which the people were effectually debarred of that diver&s;ion. Archbi&s;hop Lanfranc &s;aw with regret the&s;e examples of his tyranny and breach of faith; upon which he took the liberty to remon&s;trate in the mo&s;t gentle manner, and in particualr to remind him of the promi&s;e he had made: but William was incen&s;ed at the freedom of his expo&s;tulation, and from that in&s;tant the prelate's intere&s;t declin|ed; though he did not long &s;urvive his di&s;grace; and, when he died, was re|gretted by both nations, as a prie&s;t of extraordinary merit. <NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

<P>Such was the credit of Lanfranc, that William, rather than run the ri&s;que of incurring his di&s;plea&s;ure, had, as we have already ob&s;erved, put a re|&s;traint upon his behaviour; but now being rid of that trouble&s;ome cen&s;or, he in|dulged all his vicious appetites, and oppre&s;&s;ed the people with intolerable exac|tions, in which the clergy bore their &s;hare of oppre&s;&s;ion. He ordered a new &s;ur|vey to be taken of all the lands and property of the kingdom; and wherever he found them undervalued in the Doom&s;day-book, he rai&s;ed the proportion of taxes accordingly. The inventor and executor of all the&s;e grievances was one Ralf Flambard, &s;on of a pre&s;byter of Bayeux, who had rai&s;ed him&s;elf to a place in the great council, as well as to the favour and countenance of the king, by making him&s;elf &s;ub&s;ervient to that prince's tyranny and rapaciou&s;ne&s;s; but, in proportion as he acquired the protection and friend&s;hip of the king, he attracted the odium and re&s;entment of the people; and at length a &s;cheme was formed for his de&s;truction. One Gerold, a bold enterpri&s;ing man, decoyed him into a boat, on pretence of bringing him to the hou&s;e of Maurice, bi&s;hop of Lon|don, who&s;e chaplain he had been; and conveyed him on board of a &s;hip, which<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 10$$$</NOTE> weighed anchor immediately, and put to &s;ea. Two men were provided to a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inate this unpopular mini&s;ter; but before they could perpetrate their purpo&s;e, the &s;hip had well nigh peri&s;hed in a &s;torm; a circum&s;tance which, in tho&s;e &s;uper&s;titious times, was looked upon as an interpo&s;ition of heaven in Ralf's be|half. He did not fail to make the mo&s;t of this occurrence, and being endow|ed with a great &s;hare of eloquence and in&s;inuation, prevailed upon Gerold to &s;et him &s;afe on &s;hore; he immediately &s;ent for a guard from the next &s;tation of &s;oldiers, and, returning in triumph to London, re&s;umed his place in the king's favour and affection. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ord.

He not only &s;eized the annates or fir&s;t fruits of vacant benefices, but kept them in

his own hands for a &s;eries of years together; and after he had pillaged a dioce&s;e in this manner, &s;old it to the be&s;t bidder, without the lea&s;t regard to the morals or capacity of the purcha&s;er. At the death of Lanfranc, he appropriated the temporalities of the archbi&s;hopric to his own u&s;e, for the term of four years; and acted in the &s;ame manner with re&s;pect to the &s;ee of Lincoln, and all others that chanced to be vacated during his reign; without regarding the complaints which were made to the pope by the clergy. Indeed this was a very favourable conjuncture for his exerci&s;ing the&s;e acts of oppre&s;&s;ion with impunity, becau&s;e the church was divided by a &s;chi&s;m, and Urban II. too much engro&s;&s;ed by his pro|ject<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> for a cru&s;ade, to intermeddle in &s;uch di&s;putes.</P>

<P>William's avarice was in&s;atiate and his revenge implacable; not con|tented with having defrauded Robert of his birthright, he now re&s;olved to de|prive him of what he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. He was a &s;tranger to the ties of natural affection, and hated his brother for the attempt he had made upon the Engli&s;h throne. Finding his government firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed at home, he began to make prepara|tions for invading his father's hereditary dominions, and landed in Normandy before his brother had the lea&s;t intimation of his de&s;ign; he therefore found him altogether unprovided for his reception, and took St. Valery, Albemarle, and &s;ome other places, without the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance. In this emergency Robert had reccur&s;e to the king of France, who marched in per&s;on at the head of an army to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but he reaped very little advantage from the&s;e allies. William found means to detach Philip from the duke's intere&s;t, and that monarch retired, leaving Robert more than ever expo&s;ed to the calamities of war; for he had tru&s;ted &s;o much to the French &s;uccours, that he took no other mea&s;ures for his own defence. William continued to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of one place after ano|ther, and even carried on a &s;ecret negotiation with Conon, governor of Rouen, who promi&s;ed to put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that city; and the duke was on the brink of de&s;truction, when he prevailed upon his younger brother Henry to u&s;e tho&s;e arms as his friend, which he had actually taken up as his enemy. That prince was incen&s;ed again&s;t Robert, becau&s;e he had &s;eized the Contantin, which was mortgaged to him for the money he advanced towards the Engli&s;h expedition; and even refu&s;ed to pay the debt. Henry had a&s;&s;embled &s;ome troops to do him|&s;elf ju&s;tice; but the duke imploring his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and promi&s;ing faithfully to di&s;|charge the obligation, he e&s;pou&s;ed his quarrel, entered Rouen unexpectedly, &s;eized Conon, whom he ordered to be thrown headlong from the top of a tower, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city for his elder brother. William thus baffled by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1091.</NOTE> union of Robert and Henry, made advances towards an accommodation; and peace was concluded, on condition that Robert &s;hould cede to the king the county of Eu, Fe&s;camp, Cherbourg, and all the other places which he had reduced on the coa&s;t of Normandy; that William &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t the duke in &s;ubduing the province of Maine, which had revolted; re&s;tore the confi&s;cated Engli&s;h e&s;tates of<NOTE PLACE="marg">F$or. de Wor.

<P>How plea&s;ed &s;o ever the king and the duke might be with the articles of this treaty, Henry was extremely di&s;gu&s;ted, ina&s;much as no regard was paid to his intere&s;t; and Robert did not &s;eem inclined to keep his promi&s;e touching the payment of the money he had borrowed. Incen&s;ed at the&s;e in&s;tances of di&s;repect, he re&s;olved
<PB N="247" REF="2560">
to take &s;atisfaction by force of arms, and accordingly made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Mont Michel by &s;urpri&s;e. Robert, unwilling to lo&s;e a place of &s;uch importance, prevailed upon William to aid him in reducing the ca&s;tle, which was &s;ituated on an inacce&s;&s;ible rock wa&s;hed by the &s;ea, and twice a day quite &s;urrounded with the tide. While the two brothers lay before this fortre&s;s, which they could be&s;iege no other way but by a blockade, William taking the air one day a hor&s;eback, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the camp, perceived two hor&s;emen riding out from the ca&s;tle, and obeying the dictates of his impetuo&s;ity, attacked them with great fury; but, his hor&s;e being killed in the fir&s;t encounter, overturned and lay upon him in &s;uch a manner, that he could not di&s;engage him&s;elf. His antagoni&s;t, while he remained in this &s;ituation, had lifted up his hand in order to deprive him of his life, when he exclaimed in a menacing tone, "Hold, villain, I am the king of England." The two cavaliers were immediately &s;eized with veneration and awe, and helping him up, accommodated him with one of their hor&s;es. William &s;pringing into the &s;addle; "Follow me (&s;aid he to his conqueror) I will reward thy valour; and thou &s;halt henceforth be my knight." Mean while the &s;iege advanced very &s;low|ly, and indeed the place &s;eemed to be impregnable; when Henry, being reduced to a great &s;carcity of &s;weet-water, de&s;ired his brother Robert would &s;end him a &s;up|ply, and conquer him by arms rather than by thir&s;t. The duke, who&s;e generous temper he was well acquainted with, complied immediately with his reque&s;t, by allowing the garri&s;on to fetch as much water as they found nece&s;&s;ary; and at the &s;ame time he &s;ent a pipe of wine for his brother's own drinking. Rufus did not at all approve of this genero&s;ity, which he a&s;cribed to the folly of Robert, who ju&s;tified his conduct by ob&s;erving that the quarrel between them and Henry was not &s;uch as ought to de&s;troy the bands of natural affection, and that they might yet live to have occa&s;ion for a brother's a&s;&s;i&s;tance. After a tedious &s;iege the ca&s;tle was at la&s;t &s;urrendered; and Henry retired to Bretagne, from whence he wandered about for two years, almo&s;t de&s;titute of attendants, and &s;ometimes in want of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. At this period too, Edgar Atheling, who had returned<NOTE PLACE="marg">Id. ibid.</NOTE> from Pale&s;tine, was ordered to quit Normandy, and forbid to enter England at his peril; &s;o that he withdrew into Scotland, where he always met with a favourable reception.</P>

<P>During William's ab&s;ence from his kingdom, Malcolm the Scotti&s;h monarch invading England, ravaged the county of Northumberland; and the people of the north, complaining loudly of their being expo&s;ed to &s;uch cala|mities, from the king's leaving his dominions, Rufus returned with all expedi|tion, and prevailed upon Robert to accompany him in his campaign again&s;t the Scot. The troops being immediately a&s;&s;embled, they advanced again&s;t the enemy, who retired as they approached as far as Scot-water, where they received a me&s;&s;age from Malcolm, importing that he had nothing to offer to William except a bat|tle; but, he was ready to do homage as prince of Cumberland to Robert, as the elde&s;t &s;on of William the Conqueror. This addre&s;s occa&s;ioned a council of war, in which it was judged expedient to offer propo&s;itions of peace, as the army was greatly dimini&s;hed, and di&s;pirited by &s;ickne&s;s, fatigue, and &s;carcity of pro|vi&s;ion, and the fleet di&s;per&s;ed and mo&s;tly de&s;troyed by a tempe&s;t. Robert, there|fore, repaired with a few attendants to the Scotti&s;h camp, where he was ho&s;pitably entertained; and Malcolm a&s;&s;ured him that his army was rai&s;ed with a view to make a diver&s;ion in his favour when he was at variance with William; but now

that matters were accommodated between the brothers, he was willing to accede to the treaty on equitable terms. Thus, by the mediation of Robert, peace was con|cluded between England and Malcolm, who was confirmed in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Cumberland, for which he did homage, and received an annual gratification of twelve marks of gold.

Rufus, notwith&s;tanding the &s;ervices Robert had &s;o lately done him in the Scotti&s;h war, omitted no opportunity of debauching the Norman lords from their allegiance, and engaging them to fort$$y their ca&s;tles for his ambitious de&s;igns. While he took the&s;e mea&s;ures for paving the way to the conque&s;t of Normandy, he exerci&s;ed his authority at home, in devi&s;ing new taxes upon corporations, by which he filled his coffers, and intailed upon him&s;elf the hatred and cur&s;es of the people, Normans as well as Saxons; for he &s;punged them without di&s;tinction.</P>

<P>William Rufus, being freed from a very powerful and dangerous ene|my in the per&s;on of Malcolm, found him&s;elf at lei&s;ure to invade the territories of his own brother Robert, who, tired of the frivolous excu&s;es he made for delaying the execution of the treaty, at length &s;ent over amba&s;&s;adors to in&s;i&s;t upon the immediate performance of the articles, or in ca&s;e of his refu&s;al to fulfil them without lo&s;s of time, to denounce a war again&s;t him as a perjured prince. Wil|liam, in&s;tead of complying with this peremptory demand, rejected it with di&s;dain, and invaded Normandy with a powerful armament: however, that he might have &s;ome colour for the ho&s;tilities he intended to commit, he propo&s;ed an interview with Robert, to whom he made &s;ome propo&s;als that the other did not think equi|table. A &s;econd conference was opened in pre&s;ence of all the barons, who had witne&s;&s;ed and &s;worn to guarantee the treaty; but, this proved as fruitle&s;s as the former, becau&s;e William went over, not with a de&s;ign to effect an accommoda|tion, but to make a conque&s;t of the dukedom. Ho&s;tilities immediately com|menced, and &s;everal towns were reduced by Rufus, who began to congratulate him&s;elf on the near pro&s;pect of adding Normandy to his other dominions, when the king of France, unwilling to have &s;uch a trouble&s;ome neighbour, marched with an army to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Robert, and the &s;cene was immediately changed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$.

<P>The&s;e deva&s;tations brought over William from Normandy, who marching directly again&s;t the invaders, entered their country, and repaired the ca&s;tle of Montgomery; but the Welch, in&s;tead of hazarding a battle, retired to their woods and mountains, from whence they &s;urpri&s;ed his parties occa&s;ionally, and put them to the &s;word; &s;o that he was obliged to return with di&s;grace. He afterwards repeated the attempt with the &s;ame want of &s;ucce&s;s, and perceiving that he &s;hould never be able to &s;ubdue them by the operations of a regular campaign, he ordered the wardens of the marches to encroach upon them by degrees, and maintain their intru&s;ions with &s;trong ca&s;tles. Indeed his &s;econd expedition was relinqui&s;hed on account of receiving intelligence of the revolt of Robert Mowbray, who, being elated with the victory over the Scots at Al|newick, obtained by his forces, thought the king could never &s;ufficiently re|compence him for this important &s;ervice. William, who&s;e &s;oul was a &s;tranger to gratitude or liberality, paid very little regard to his merit.; and Mowbray re|&s;olved to take vengeance upon him for his neglect, by removing him from the throne, and &s;etting the crown upon Stephen, count of Albemarle, the Con|queror's nephew. In this de&s;ign he had found means to engage a great number of malecontent noblemen; and their mea&s;ure; were kept &s;o &s;ecret, that the king did not receive intimation of the plot, until he had entered Wales.</P>

<P>He forthwith changed the object of his enterprize, and directed his march again&s;t Mowbray, who had fortified the ca&s;tle of Bamburg. In his rout he mu&s;t have fallen into an ambu&s;cade prepared by the revolters, had not Richard de Tunbridge, who was concerned in the &s;cheme, repented of his trea|&s;on, and warned William of the danger. When he arrived at Bamburg he found it impregnable, from the nature of it's &s;ituation; and, turning the &s;iege into a blockade, erected a fortre&s;s called Mauvoi&s;in, or Bad neighbour, &s;o near it as to prevent &s;upplies of provi&s;ions from being carried to the be&s;ieged; and hav|ing furni&s;hed this new fort with a &s;trong garri&s;on, retired with the re&s;t of his ar|my. In the cour&s;e of this blockade, Robert formed a &s;cheme for &s;urpri&s;ing Newca&s;tle; but his motions were &s;o narrowly watched by the troops in Mauvoi|&s;in, that in&s;tead of carrying his point, he was forced to fly to the mona&s;tery of St. O&s;win, at Tinmouth, in which he and all his officers were taken, after a de&s;|perate

Morel &s;aved his life by making a fuil di&s;covery of the con&s;piracy, in con&s;equence of which a great number of unhappy people were puni&s;hed with great &s;everity. Hugh, earl of Shrew&s;bury, purcha&s;ed his pardon with the &s;um of three thou&s;and pounds: Ro|ger de Lacy making his e&s;cape into France, his lands were confi&s;cated and be|&s;towed upon his brother Eu, who had continued faithful to the king; and<NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

The count de Eu being accu&s;ed as an accomplice in this plot, by Geoffry Barnard, and the proof deficient, the count offered to prove his innocence in &s;ingle com|bat; a manner of deci&s;ion imported into England by the Franks and Longo|bards, &s;ince the conque&s;t. The li&s;ts were accordingly enclo&s;ed, the day and judges appointed: the duel was fought at Sali&s;bury, and the count being vanqui&s;hed, it was decreed that he &s;hould lo&s;e his eyes, and be deprived of his virility. His kin&s;man William de Alderi being convicted at the &s;ame time, was &s;entenced to be hanged; and declared at the place of execution, that as he hoped for mercy at the hands of God, he was entirely innocent of the crime laid to his charge; and he was credited by the majority of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ord. $word$.</NOTE> nation.</P>

<P>William had no &s;ooner de&s;troyed the roots of this con&s;piracy, than he found him&s;elf involved in a di&s;agreeable quarrel with An&s;elm, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who was too &s;crupulou&s;ly attached to the immunities and dignity of the church; and was indeed a prelate of a very haughty di&s;po&s;ition. He ac|knowledged Urban II. as lawful pope, though he knew that the king inclined towards Clement; and a law had been enacted during the preceding reign, to prohibit all per&s;ons from acknowledging any pope without the king's con&s;ent. An&s;elm pretended that the king had no right to intermeddle in church affairs: but William, far from &s;ub&s;cribing to this doctrine, began to treat him &s;o roughly, that he de&s;$ed permi&s;&s;ion to retire to Rome: th$s reque&s;t was at fir&s;t denied, but afterwards granted; though Rufus, in order to mortify the prelate, &s;ent an offi|cer to &s;earch his baggage, after he was on board, and &s;eize all his money, on pre|tence of the law which forbad the exportation of &s;ilver. Immediately after An|&s;elm's departure, he appropriated to his own u&s;e the temporalities of the &s;ee, which he enjoyed all the remaining part of his life; while the exa&s;perated pre|late<NOTE PLACE="marg">S$m.

<P>Urban's attention was too much engro&s;&s;ed with the execution of the cru&s;ade, to intere&s;t him&s;elf in &s;uch unimportant di&s;putes. His &s;cheme was to re&s;cue the Holy land from the dominion of the Saracens; a romantic &s;cheme, with which he was infected by a fanatic friar, known by the name of Peter the Hermit. The pope had preached in the council of Clermont, exhorting the nations to engage in this holy enterprize. An infi$ite number of princes and noblemen had a&s;&s;umed the red-cro&s;$, which was &s;ewed on the &s;houlder as a badge of their undertaking; and among the re&s;t Robert, duke of Normandy,

who glowed with ambition to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf in an expedition upon which the eyes of all Europe were turned. As he wanted money to defray the ne|ce&s;&s;ary expence, he had recour&s;e to his brother William, of whom he propo&s;ed to borrow ten thou&s;and marks of gold, on a mortgage of his dukedom. Ru|fus lent a willing ear to his propo&s;al; but his kingdom being already too much exhau&s;ted by uncon&s;cionable exactions, he bethought him&s;elf of another expe|dient, which &s;ucceeded to his wi&s;h. He applied for a loan to the riche&s;t of his &s;ubjects, &s;ecular as well as eccle&s;ia&s;tic; and his reque&s;t having all the air of a commandment, they generally complied, though not without murmur|ing. A few people, who pleaded poverty, were compelled to find what was demanded of them; and many eccle&s;ia&s;tics, on pretence of indigence, melted down the plate of their churches and mona&s;teries, in order to &s;upply his occa|&s;ions. Having in this manner ama&s;&s;ed the nece&s;&s;ary &s;um, he made a voyage to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoved.</NOTE> Normandy, of which he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for the term of five years, according to the agreement with his brother, who, being thus &s;upplied, &s;et out on the cru&s;ade to A&s;ia Minor, and was pre&s;ent at the reduction of Nice, Antioch, and Jeru&s;alem, on which occa&s;ions he &s;ignalized his valour, conduct, and mi|litary &s;kill, above all the princes that embarked in the expedition.</P>

<P>Immediately after the duke's departure, William, as mortgagee of Normandy, demanded of the king of France, the French part of the Vexin, which, he pretended, was an appurtenance of the dutchy; and Philip's refu&s;al was attended with a war, which produced no remarkable tran&s;action, and was in a little time terminated by a treaty. Rufus, on his return to England, made ano|ther attempt upon Wales, in full re&s;olution to exterminate all the males of that nation; but he was again foiled, and obliged to de&s;i&s;t from his de&s;ign.

<P>He gave orders for rebuilding London-Bridge, which had been de|moli&s;hed by torrents; for &s;urrounding the Tower with a &s;trong wall and ram|part; and for erecting the &s;tructure of We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, which, though one of the large&s;t in Europe, he, on his return from Normandy, affected to de&s;pi&s;e as a petty bed-chamber. During his re&s;idence on the continent, he had endea|voured ineffectually to recover Le Maine by force of arms from Helie de la Fleche, who had &s;eized that province, on pretence of &s;ome agreement with Ro|bert before he &s;et out for Pale&s;tine. The Manceaux declared for La Fleche, and guarded their pa&s;&s;es in &s;uch a manner, that William could not enter their country; &s;o that a kind of pyratical war was maintained, until William's general, Robert Bele&s;me, had the good fortune to take Helie in an ambu&s;|cade. The king having &s;ecured this enterpri&s;ing officer at Rouen, rai&s;ed a great army of Bretons, Flemings, Burgundians, Normans, and Engli&s;h, in hope of reducing the province, without farther oppo&s;ition: but, he met with a formidable antagoni&s;t in the per&s;on of Fulk Rechen, count of Anjou, of whom Helie held the county in va&s;&s;alage, and was obliged to have recour&s;e to an expedient, which he had practi&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s on other occa&s;ions. In a word, he purcha&s;ed a treaty of peace, by which he was re&s;tored to the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of Le Maine, in con&s;ideration of &s;etting Helie at liberty, with all the pri|&s;oners he had taken. The town of Mans was immediately &s;urrendered to Wil|liam, and the nobility of Le Maine took the oath of allegiance: Helie offered his &s;ervice to the king, who was at fir&s;t inclinable to engage &s;uch an active warrior in his intere&s;t, but he was di&s;&s;uaded by Robert, count of Meulan, his chief coun&s;ellor, who perhaps was jealous of Helie's talents; and this la&s;t &s;eeing his offer rejected, told William that &s;ince he had no occa&s;ion for his &s;er|vice, he could not blame him for attempting to recover the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions he had lo&s;t. The king replied, that he might act as he &s;hould think proper, and granted him a &s;afe conduct to La Fleche, which he fortified without delay. Not that he committed any act of ho&s;tility while Rufus tarried in Normandy; but when he returned to England, Helie &s;eized the very fir&s;t opportunity to re|new the war.</P>

A courier di&s;patched by Robert de Bele&s;me with an account of this &s;urpri&s;al, found William hunting in the New Fore&s;t; and he no &s;ooner re|ceived the intelligence, than calling aloud to his attendants, "You that love me, follow me;" rode directly to the &s;ea-&s;ide, near Dartmouth, where he found a ve&s;&s;el ready to &s;ail.

<P>About this period, the cru&s;ards took the city of Jeru&s;alem, where they committed horrid barbarities; and, intending to erect it into a kingdom, offered the crown to Robert, duke of Normandy, who declining that dignity, they elected Godfrey, count of Bouillon, who&s;e valour and conduct had greatly contributed to the &s;ucce&s;s of the enterprize. William, duke of Guienne, ani|mated by the example of &s;o many princes, and the glory which they had already acquired, re&s;olved to take the cro&s;s, and conduct a &s;trong reinforcement to the Chri&s;tians in the Holy land: but, as this &s;cheme could not be executed without a con&s;iderable expence, which his revenues could not de&s;ray, he had recour&s;e to the king of England, who agreed to advance a &s;um of money, on the &s;ame terms which had been embraced by his brother Robert.

Rufus, &s;miling at his &s;u|per&s;tition, ordered him to be paid for his zeal, and de&s;ired him to dream more favourably for the future. He was attended by Walter Tyrrel, a French knight, famous for his archery, who always accompanied him in tho&s;e excur|&s;ions; and to whom he that afternoon gave two arrows out of his own hand.

As the &s;un beamed in his face, he held up his hand before his eyes, and &s;tood in that po&s;|ture looking at the wounded deer, when another &s;tarting from a thicket, Tyrrel let fly an arrow, which either glanced from a tree or the horns of the &s;tag,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

He was equally void of learning, principle, and humanity; haughty, pa&s;&s;ionate, brutal, profligate, and ungrateful; a &s;coffer at religion; a &s;courge to the clergy; vain-glorious, talkative, rapacious, lavi&s;h, and di&s;&s;olute, and an inveterate ene|my

<P>Had Robert been in Normandy when William died, he would in all probability have mounted the Engli&s;h throne without oppo&s;ition, according to the &s;tipulations of the treaty concluded between the two brothers, and ratified by the principal noblemen of both countries: but, in&s;tead of returning home immediately after the reduction of Jeru&s;alem, he lingered by the way in Apulia, where he married Sybilla, daughter of William, count of Conver&s;ana, a lady renowned for her beauty and qualifications; and while he indulged him&s;elf in the enjoyment of his amiable bride, who&s;e fortune he lavi&s;hed away among his fol|lowers, he lo&s;t the opportunity which never afterwards occurred. The Engli&s;h nation was divided between affecti$n and intere&s;t; they loved Robert for his good nature and genero&s;ity, but they dreaded his indolence and profu&s;ion; and ju&s;tly concluded, from the fame of his expen&s;ive living in this la&s;t cru&s;ade, that on his return he would be ab&s;olutely de&s;titute of all means to make good his preten&s;ions. On the other hand, Henry was a native of England, born after his father's acce&s;&s;ion to the throne; a circum&s;tance which had weight with &s;ome people: but the great advantage which this prince had over his brother was being on the &s;pot, to take the fir&s;t and mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures for the &s;upport of his preten&s;ions. He was employed in the &s;ame diver&s;ion, and in the &s;ame fore&s;t which proved fatal to William, when he heard of that prince's death; and rode full &s;peed to Winche&s;ter, where he demanded the keys of the royal trea&s;ury, which were in the hands of William de Breteuil, elde&s;t &s;on of William Fitzo&s;bern, formerly earl of Hereford. That nobleman had ju&s;t arrived from the New Fore&s;t, where he too had been hunting; and, informed of the

king's cata&s;trophe, ha&s;tened home to take care of his charge, which he flatly refu&s;ed to re&s;ign, telling Henry the &s;ceptre of England belonged to his brother Robert, for whom he would re&s;erve the trea&s;ure and his allegiance, according to the oath he had taken. The di&s;pute was on the point of producing blood&s;hed, when Robert, count de Meulant, and a great number of the late king's atten|dants, coming up, e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of Henry, and compelled Breteuil to &s;ur|render the trea&s;ure, with part of which they in all probability hoped to be re|warded for their &s;ervice. He was immediately proclaimed king, after a very tumultuary election, influenced by the populace, which denounced vengeance upon all tho&s;e who &s;hould dare to di&s;pute his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and he forthwith began to exerci&s;e the regal authority, in preferring William Giffard to the &s;ee of Win|che&s;ter. Then he and his parti&s;ans &s;et out for London, where he was anointed and crowned in We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey, by Maurice, bi&s;hop of London, after he had taken the coronation oath; and this ceremony was fini&s;hed in &s;ixty-&s;ix hours after the death of the late king: &s;o much was Henry afraid that Robert might arrive unexpectedly, and anticipate his de&s;ign.</P>

<P>As the people had too much rea&s;on, during the two la&s;t reigns, to think that a king is very apt to forget or di&s;regard his coronation oath, Henry, for the farther &s;atisfaction of his &s;ubjects, granted that &s;ame day a charter, con|firming their privileges, and redre&s;&s;ing &s;ome grievances under which they laboured. By this deed, which was authenticated in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, and tran|&s;cribed into a great number of copies di&s;per&s;ed all over the kingdom, he e&s;ta|bli&s;hed the churches in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all their immunities, and exempted them from all the hard&s;hips they had &s;u&s;tained from the tyranny of Rufus, e&s;pecially that of being kept vacant for the king's u&s;e, and afterwards put up to public &s;ale, without any regard to merit or capacity. He aboli&s;hed the exce&s;&s;ive fines which u&s;ed to be exacted from the heirs of noblemen for the livery of their lands; and at the &s;ame time exempted the va&s;&s;als of noblemen from the &s;ame impo&s;ition; he permitted all the va&s;&s;als of the crown to di&s;po&s;e of their children in marriage, ac|cording to their own plea&s;ure, except to the king's enemies; widows were inve&s;ted with the &s;ame privilege, without being obliged to pay for licences from the crown; he granted the ward&s;hip of minors to the mother or neare&s;t relation; he &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed the duty of moneyage, paid once in three years, in con&s;ideration of the king's pre&s;erving the value of the coin unaltered; he remitted all fines, mulcts, and debts in the exchequer, ari&s;ing from vexatious pro&s;ecution; allowed the ba|rons to bequeath their per&s;onal e&s;tates by will; and regulated the divi&s;ion of ef|fects belonging to tho&s;e who died inte&s;tate, among their wives, children, and neare&s;t relations; he mitigated the &s;ecurity given by per&s;ons charged with felony or mi&s;demeanour; pardoned all murders and other offences committed before his coronation; exempted the lands po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the military tenants of the crown from gelds, talliages, and benevolences; he re&s;tored the laws of St. Edward, and forgave all rapine and depredation, provided the offenders would make im|mediate re&s;titution. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth.

peculation.

As Henry had been greatly obliged to the citizens of London, in his acqui&s;ition of the crown, he gratified them with a charter of very ample privileges; and, in order to crown the &s;atisfaction of the people, he recalled An&s;elm archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury, who was become extremely popular in England, through the influence of the monks, by this time &s;ettled in almo&s;t all the benefices of the kingdom. That prelate accepted the invitation with tran&s;port, e&s;pecially as the king hinted that he &s;hould have the chief direction of affairs, and landed at Dover, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible joy of the whole nation; but Henry was a little confounded when he refu&s;ed to do him homage, adhering to the canons of the council of Bari, which forbad eccle|&s;ia&s;tics to receive inve&s;titures from the laity, or to pay them homage on any account. The conditions therefore of their living together in a good under&s;tanding were, that the king &s;hould relinqui&s;h the prerogative of inve&s;ting bi&s;hops and abbots, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">E$dmer.</NOTE> in every thing relating to the church, pay implicit obedience to the pope. Henry, though &s;hocked at the in&s;olent propo&s;als of this arrogant prie&s;t, who wanted to curtail his authority, was forced to temporize, becau&s;e not yet firmly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed on the throne; for he knew that An&s;elm, by throwing his intere&s;t into the &s;cale of Robert, might keep the balance in &s;u&s;pence, and perhaps make the other end preponderate. He therefore propo&s;ed that agents &s;hould be di&s;patched to Rome, with a remon&s;trance to the pope, de&s;iring his holine&s;s to di&s;pen&s;e with the canons about inve&s;titures, as &s;uch laws were diametrically oppo&s;ite to the cu&s;toms of the nation; and that in the mean time An&s;elm &s;hould enter into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his &s;ee. This expedient was approved, and a kind of truce concluded, until the deputies could obtain an an&s;wer from the Roman pontiff.</P>

<P>Henry's intere&s;t was concerned in another view to maintain the favour of the archbi&s;hop. He had acquired the reputation of a debauchee from the pro&s;ecution of promi&s;cuous amours; and he re&s;olved by one &s;tep to retrieve his character, and &s;trengthen his title to the throne. Maude, daughter of Mal|colm III. by Margaret, &s;i&s;ter to Edgar Atheling, had been brought from Scotland by her uncle, and educated in a nunnery at Winche&s;ter, under the eye of her aunt Chri&s;tian. This prince&s;s did the king propo&s;e to marry; but as &s;he had wore the veil, though not a pro&s;e&s;&s;ed nun, it was nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e the credit of the archbi&s;hop, who a&s;&s;embling a council at Lambeth, took cognizance of the affair in a judicial manner, and declared Maude free from any eccle&s;ia&s;tical re&s;trictions;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Id.

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions Robert, duke of Normandy, arrived in his dominions, and re&s;umed the reins of government without oppo&s;ition; for, although they had been mortgaged to the late king William, Henry did not choo&s;e<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

But Robert, far from thinking him&s;elf obliged by this forbearance, made no &s;ecret of his re&s;entment again&s;t his brother, who had &s;upplanted him in his ab&s;ence; and loudly declared he would take the fir&s;t opportunity of doing him&s;elf ju&s;tice. He was confirmed in this re&s;olution by the bi&s;hop of Durham, who had e&s;caped from the Tower;
<PB N="259" REF="2680">
and &s;everal Norman noblemen undertook to &s;upport his preten&s;ions; he even found means to rai&s;e a con&s;iderable party among the Engli&s;h, and began to make preparations for invading England. Henry could plainly perceive that his &s;ub|jects fluctuated in their inclinations between him and his brother; and that they made a wide di&s;tinction between Robert in Pale&s;tine and Robert in Normandy. In this emergency he had recour&s;e to An&s;elm, who employed all his credit in fixing him upon the throne; he convened the principal noblemen, Normans as well as Engli&s;h, and expatiated with &s;uch eloquence and energy upon the cala|mities of a civil war, and the &s;incerity of Henry's intention to make his people happy, that they &s;eemed intirely &s;atisfied, and determined to be quiet. Never|thele&s;s it was no &s;ooner known that Robert was ready to embark, than the majo|rity of the lords declared for him, and part of the fleet followed that example.</P>

<P>This defection facilitated his de&s;cent at Port&s;mouth, where he was joined by a great number of his brother's &s;ubjects, who promi&s;ed to ri&s;que their lives and fortunes in his &s;ervice; and a&s;&s;ured him that Henry in a little time would be abandoned by the whole nation. Mean while the king exerted him&s;elf in a&s;&s;embling his troops, and the archbi&s;hop employed his eloquence and emi&s;&s;aries &s;o effectually in repre&s;enting the impiety of violating oaths, e&s;pecially that of al|legiance to a king, who had made &s;uch conce&s;&s;ions to his people, that the whole army became &s;taunch to their cau&s;e, and a number of noblemen and officers who wavered, were by the&s;e harrangues confirmed in their fidelity to Henry. The king's forces thus a&s;&s;ured, advanced from Peven&s;ey towards Port&s;mouth, and the competitors were &s;oon in &s;ight of each other; though both equally unwil|ling to hazard a battle, becau&s;e Robert found him&s;elf di&s;appointed in his expecta|tion of being joined by the Engli&s;h, and Henry did not know how far he could confide in his &s;oldiers, though he fore&s;aw that his own perdition mu&s;t be the con|&s;equence of his defeat. An&s;elm took this opportunity of offering his mediation, which was reinforced by all the noblemen and prelates in both armies; and after &s;ome debate a treaty of peace was concluded, on condition that Robert &s;hould quit his claim to England, in con&s;ideration of Henry's paying him annually the &s;um of three thou&s;and marks, and giving up the Cotantin, with all that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in Nor|mandy, except Danfront, which he could not cede without breaking the oath he had taken to the inhabitants when they received him into the place; that the adherents of each party &s;hould be re&s;tored to the lands and honours they formerly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, whether in England or in Normandy; and that if either prince &s;hould die without i&s;&s;ue, the &s;urvivor &s;hould &s;ucceed to his dominions. This treaty be|ing &s;igned and ratified, the armies on each &s;ide were di&s;banded, and Robert, having lived two months in the utmo&s;t harmony with his brother, returned in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron.

<P>Henry, having e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf in the throne by virtue of this ac|commodation, could not without re&s;entment remember tho&s;e by whom his crown had been brought into &s;uch jeopardy; and though he had executed the articles of the treaty even &s;o as to permit the re&s;toration of Flambard to the &s;ee of Dur|ham, yet he re&s;olved to puni&s;h every per&s;on of importance, who had joined his bro|ther; and that puni&s;hment took place as &s;oon as he could find other pretexts for ex|erci&s;ing his revenge.

Here he attacked Bridgenorth, counted the &s;tronge&s;t place in England, and well &s;upplied with men, ammuni|tion, and provi&s;ion.

<P>This di&s;pute with the court of Rome did not divert Henry's atten|tion from his own intere&s;t in other particulars. One of his chief aims was to re|duce the exorbitant power of the nobility; and he became immen&s;ely rich by the confi&s;cation of the barons who had declared for his brother. Among the&s;e William de Warenne, earl of Surry, retiring to Normandy, and complaining to the duke of the great e&s;tate he had lo&s;t in his cau&s;e; Robert, who had a great &s;hare of knight-errantry in his compo&s;ition, came over immediately to England, with eleven followers, in order to per&s;uade his brother to make re&s;titution. Henry pretended to take umbrage at this vi&s;it, a&s;&s;embled a council extraordi|nary, to deliberate in what manner he &s;hould be treated, and &s;ent a formal me&s;|&s;age to know the cau&s;e of his arrival in England. When he expo&s;tulated with the king about the confi&s;cation of the earl of Surry, Henry upbraided him in very har&s;h terms with a breach of their treaty, in granting to Robert de Be|le&s;me his father's deme&s;nes in Normandy; and Robert began to find him&s;elf in a very tickli&s;h &s;ituation. The count de Meulant, Henry's prime mini&s;ter, hinted to him, that he had no other way of e&s;caping the danger, than that of relinqui&s;hing his annuity; and when Robert made a pre&s;ent of this pen&s;ion to the queen, Henry's countenance cleared up, the earl of Surry was re&s;tored to his honours, and Robert returned to his own dominions, cur&s;ing his own ra&s;h, un|premeditated conduct. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ord.

<P>In the cour&s;e of the &s;ucceeding year, Henry exhibited another fla|grant proof of his own avarice, and hatred to tho&s;e whom he knew or believed to be favourers of his brother's intere&s;t. William, count de Mortmain, and earl of Cornwal, his own cou&s;in german, claimed the earldom of Kent, as heir to Odo, bi&s;hop of Bayeux, who had accompanied the duke of Normandy in his expedition to the Holy land, and died at Palermo in Sicily. This demand was made of Henry at the very time of his being threatened with the la&s;t inva|&s;ion; and the king had amu&s;ed him with a favourable an&s;wer, until the &s;torm was blown over, that William might not be provoked to join his brother: the earl accordingly ob&s;erved a &s;trict neutrality; but when he repeated his claim af|ter the peace, Henry not only mortified him with a flat denial, but al&s;o called

him to account for &s;ome lands, which he affirmed William illegally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. He therefore in$ti$u$ed a proce&s;s again&s;t him; and the ju&s;ticiaries, after a formal tri|al, dive&s;ted him not only of the lands in que&s;tion, but al&s;o of his earldom and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An$ Ch. 110$</NOTE> whole fortune in England. William, enraged at this oppre&s;&s;ion, retired to his county of Mortmain, in Normandy, from whence he ravaged the territories which Henry had not yet relinqui&s;hed, according to the treaty with his brother: &s;o that the count and Robert de $word$ at the head of two &s;eparate troops of<NOTE PLACE="marg">G Malme&s;b.

The duke of Bretagne and the count of Anjou allowed Henry to put garri&s;ons into &s;ome of their frontier places, rather than make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the whole dutchy, becau&s;e they perceived that no peace could be made, except to their prejudice.

Robert, being by this time convinced of his bro|ther's de&s;ign to deprive him of his dutchy, and finding his affairs in a de&s;pe|rate &s;ituation, took the &s;trange re&s;olution of appealing to Henry's natural af|fection, which he e&s;timated according to the emotions of his own heart, and re|paired to England during the winter, in hope of prevailing upon his brother to de&s;i$t from his enterprize, and re&s;tore the towns he had taken; but he had &s;o far mi&s;reckoned upon his brother's good nature, that he found him&s;elf treated with the utmo&s;t in&s;olence and contempt; and Henry, far from complying with his reque&s;t, gave him to under&s;tand he might think him&s;elf extremely happy in being permitted to return.

<P>The campaign was opened with the &s;iege of Tenerchebray, belonging to the count de Mortagne, who had by this time e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of the duke; and as the place was &s;trongly fortified with &s;oldiers and provi&s;ion, it &s;u&s;tained a &s;iege until Robert was in a condition to march to its relief, with reinforcements he had received from Mortagne, Belle&s;me, the king of France, and &s;ome Norman noblemen, who dete&s;ted the &s;elfi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition of Henry, and were of con&s;e|quence aver&s;e to his government. Thus &s;upported, Robert re&s;olved to give his brother battle; and when the two armies were in &s;ight of each other, &s;ome monks employed their mediation to prevent the effu&s;ion of blood; but, as Henry in&s;i&s;ted upon the duke's renouncing the government of his dominions in|tirely, and one half of the revenue, the propo&s;al was rejected with di&s;dain, and a battle immediately en&s;ued. Robert charged the main body of the Engli&s;h with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, and was &s;o well &s;econded by the count of Mortagne, that they were broken and gave g ound; but Robert de Belle&s;me, who commanded one of the wings, was at the &s;ame time put to flight by the count de Maine, and the king advancing with a fre&s;h body of hor&s;e to &s;u&s;tain the center, the Engli&s;h and Bretons rallied immediately, and Robert's little army, weakened by the de|feat of Belle&s;me, and overpowered with numbers, was entirely routed, in &s;pite of all his efforts and acts of per&s;onal valour.

<P>The fir&s;t &s;tep he took after his arrival, was extremely agreeable to his &s;ubjects; this was the reformation of &s;ome abu&s;es which had crept into the regula|tion and oeconomy of his court. By the feudal tenure, the tenants, on the crown deme&s;nes, were obliged to furni&s;h the king and his retinue with all nece&s;&s;aries and provi&s;ions when he travelled, under the in&s;pection of the &s;teward of the hou&s;ehold, who attended him in his progre&s;s. Henry's followers made u&s;e of this pretext to commit all &s;orts of outrages; they wa&s;ted the country through which they pa&s;&s;ed; burned or &s;old publicly the &s;uperfluous provi&s;ions they found in their lodg|ings, wa&s;hed their hor&s;es with the liquors they could not con&s;ume, in&s;ulted their landlords, violated their wives and daughters, and acted with &s;uch brutality, that the people hearing of the king's approach, de&s;erted their habitations, and re|tired to the woods with their families and effects. To remedy the&s;e di&s;orders, Henry publi&s;hed an edict, by virtue of which the per&s;ons convicted of &s;uch of|fences were puni&s;hed with the lo&s;s of eyes, or hands, or &s;ome other member; and this law being vigorou&s;ly executed, &s;oon redre&s;&s;ed the grievance. At the &s;ame time he enacted another decree again&s;t coiners, who had long adulterated the currency, under the protection of the nobles, for whom they worked privately in their hou&s;es, to which the officers of ju&s;tice had no acce&s;s: by this edict it was ordained that fal&s;e coiners &s;hould, upon conviction, lo&s;e their eyes and their verility. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat.

<P>At this period too he impo&s;ed a grievous tax upon the kingdom, in order to maintain a war again&s;t Lewis, king of France, with whom he had been always at variance &s;ince that prince's acce&s;&s;ion to the throne.

one of his nobles took the liberty to ob&s;erve, his reputation would &s;uffer from his philo&s;ophy, when Henry replied very calmly, he had learned from his father, that the be&s;t way of dealing with the French was to let them &s;pend their fir&s;t fire. Perhaps he was perplexed in his own mind, becau&s;e he knew not whom he could tru&s;t in Normandy. He had &s;eized the per&s;ons of &s;ome who&s;e fidelity he &s;u&s;pected, and among others Hugh de Gourney, and Henry count D'Eu, who were not relea&s;ed until they had &s;urrendered their ca&s;tles, and who were no &s;ooner out of his power, than they took up arms again&s;t him. As he would not venture to employ the Normans, who, for the mo&s;t part, were di&s;|affected to his per&s;on, he had been obliged to carry on the war with the help of the Engli&s;h, and &s;ome Bretons he enli&s;ted in his &s;ervice; and he met with &s;everal checks, which &s;erved to increa&s;e his caution. Evreux had been &s;ur|prized by Amaury de Monfort, whom Henry attempted in vain to bribe over to his intere&s;t: the French had taken L'aigle; and the king, in attempting to recover it, had like to have lo&s;t his life: the count of Anjou had wor&s;ted Henry as he advanced to the relief of Alen&ccedil;on, which the count had inve&s;ted, and afterwards reduced: Baldwin, count of Flanders, had ravaged the whole country as far as Rouen, where the king lay with his troops, afraid to give him battle; &s;o that he had great rea&s;on to dread the i&s;&s;ue of another war. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron.

Baldwin died of a wound he received in the face with a lance. En|querrand de Chaumont, an enterpri&s;ing warrior, who had kept all the country as far as Rouen in continual alarms, was taken off by a natural death; and Fulk, count of Anjou, who had joined Lewis &s;ince the la&s;t treaty between Henry and him, was now again attached to the king of England, by means of a large &s;um of money, and the con&s;ummation of the marriage between young William and the count's daughter.</P>

<P>Thus freed from &s;uch a triumvirate of formidable enemies, he<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

While he exerted all his endeavours to rally his troops, he was &s;ingled out by a brave Nor|man knight, called William Cri&s;pin, who di&s;charged at his head two &s;uch fu|rious &s;trokes of a &s;abre, as penetrated his helmet and wounded him &s;everely; at the &s;ight of his own blood, which ru&s;hed down his vi&s;age, he was enraged to a double exertion of his &s;trength, and retorted the blows with &s;uch intere&s;t that his antagoni&s;t was unhor&s;ed and taken pri&s;oner.

<P>At this period the rights and independency of the Engli&s;h church were invaded by the pope, who, notwith&s;tanding the promi&s;es he had made Henry at their interview in Gifors, no &s;ooner found him&s;elf e&s;tabli&s;hed in the papacy by the captivity and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of Gregory the antipope, than he re&s;olved to exerci&s;e the authority of the Roman church to its full extent, and &s;ent cardinal de Crema as his legate a latere into England. That prelate was honourably re|ceived at his arrival by the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, in who&s;e place he officiated at divine &s;ervice, &s;itting in the highe&s;t feat and wearing the pontifical habit, to the amazement and indignation of the Engli&s;h people. As he was directed to in|quire into a controver&s;y which had ari&s;en between the archbi&s;hop of York and the Scotti&s;h bi&s;hops, who refu&s;ed to acknowledge the &s;upremacy of that &s;ee, he made a progre&s;s into the north as far as Roxburgh, where he had a conference on the &s;ub|ject with David, king of Scotland: at his return to London, he a&s;&s;embled a general council, in which he pre&s;ided on a throne rai&s;ed above the Engli&s;h archbi&s;hops; and enacted among other laws, a very &s;evere canon again&s;t the marriage of the cl$rg$, again&s;t which he declaimed with great intemperance, affirming it was a crime of the deepe&s;t dye for a man to con&s;ecrate the body of Chri&s;t immediately after leaving the arms of a &s;trumpet; an epithet which he $e&s;towed on the wives of the clergy. His own conduct very ill agreed with this declaration; for, the very next night, after having con&s;ecrated the euchari&s;t, he him&s;elf was caught in bed with a common pro&s;titute, and &s;o confounded at the detection, that he in the morning decamped very privately, and the council broke up abruptly on<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth.

<P>The untimely death of this young prince, who had already ex|hibited repeated proofs of extraordinary courage and ability, entirely di&s;pelled the fears of Henry. He made peace with Lewis; entered into a league with Thierry of Al&s;ace, who &s;ucceeded to the county of Flanders, and married Henry's daughter-in-law Sybilla; while the Normans, &s;eeing no hope of being delivered from his yoke, began to be reconciled to his dominion. Indeed he took &s;ome pains to reconcile them to his government. He extended his forgivene&s;s to all tho&s;e who implored his mercy; and attached &s;everal men of influence and cre|dit to his intere&s;t, by acts of kindne&s;s and genero&s;ity: among others relea&s;ing Mellent and Fitz-Gervai&s;e from the pri&s;ons in which they had been confined,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

The former of the&s;e accompanied him to England, where he became a great favourite, and &s;erved the king with uncommon zeal and fidelity. It was at this period that Henry altered the revenue of his deme&s;ne lands, the rents of which had been hitherto paid in kind. The tenants were &s;o impoveri&s;hed with taxes, and other hard&s;hips, from the nature of their tenure, that they took all opportunities of meeting him in his progre&s;s, and pre&s;enting their plough&s;hares as u&s;ele&s;s imple|ments. A dreadful famine en&s;ued; and the king at la&s;t appointed commi&s;&s;ion|ers to examine the e&s;tates, and fix a certain prince in money to be annually paid in lieu of the corn, provi&s;ion, and &s;ervice, which had been u&s;ually exacted.

<P>SO weak is human fore&s;ight, that &s;ome of the mea&s;ures which Henry took to &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of his crown to his daughter, contributed to her ex|clu&s;ion. In order to &s;trengthen the intere&s;ts of his family, he had heaped favours upon Stephen, the third &s;on of the count de Blois, by Adela, daughter of the Conqueror. He care&s;&s;ed him at his court, and not only be&s;towed upon him the honour of Eye and all the great e&s;tate of Robert Malet, but he had al&s;o effected a match between him and Maud, daughter and heire&s;s of Eu&s;tace, count de Boulogne, by Mary of Scotland, &s;i&s;ter to king Henry's fir&s;t queen. In right of this lady Stephen &s;ucceeded to the county of Boulogne, be&s;ides a va&s;t e&s;tate in England, which had been given to her ance&s;tors at the conque&s;t. Henry thinking he could not do too much for his own nephews, who would undoubtedly &s;upport the intere&s;t of the empre&s;s again&s;t all oppo&s;ition, created Stephen's younger brother Henry, abbot of Gla&s;tonbury and bi&s;hop of Winche&s;|ter; &s;o that the two brothers were by far the mo&s;t powerful &s;ubjects in the king|dom. Stephen, con&s;cious of his own importance and popularity, which was very great, could not re&s;i&s;t the temptation of appropriating the crown to him|&s;elf, in&s;tead of &s;ecuring it to Maud, who&s;e title he had &s;o &s;olemnly &s;worn to maintain. He reflected upon the ea&s;e with which Henry had &s;upplanted the ab&s;ent heir of blood, and he re&s;olved in this particular to follow his example. In matters of le&s;s importance he might have obeyed the dictates of his gratitude and duty to his benefactor, and re&s;pected the oath he had taken; but Henry him&s;elf, and many other princes of that age, had manife&s;ted by their whole conduct, how little they were re&s;trained by the ties of religion and morality, when a crown was the object in view. He therefore, in his uncle's life-time, began to form a party among the Engli&s;h noblemen, while his brother employ|ed all his influence to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s the clergy in his behalf. The endeavours of both &s;ucceeded even beyond their expectation. The Engli&s;h had been accu&s;tom|ed to &s;ee the heir of blood excluded from their throne; they loved the per&s;on and character of Stephen; did not much reli&s;h a female reign, which they had never experienced; and both Normans and Engli&s;h &s;aw the blood of the Con|queror<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden. $.

<P>Having thus paved the way to u&s;urpation he retired to Boulogne, from whence, on the fir&s;t news of Henry's death, he &s;et &s;ail for Dover, where he was treated with great di&s;re&s;pect by the burghers, who under&s;tood the cau&s;e and intent of his coming. He was likewi&s;e in&s;ulted by the inhabitants of Canterbury, who &s;hut their gates again&s;t him; but far from being di&s;couraged by the&s;e repul&s;es he proceeded to London, where he was received with great honours by the citi|zens, who &s;aluted him as king. Thence repairing to Winche&s;ter, his brother, who was bi&s;hop of that &s;ee, prevailed upon William de Pont-del Arche to de|liver up the late king's trea&s;ure, amounting to one hundred thou&s;and pounds in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron.

<P>Stephen, finding his pre&s;ence would be nece&s;&s;ary to quiet the&s;e di&s;|turbances, &s;et &s;ail for Normandy, and being joined at La Hogue by the count de Blois, vi&s;ited Lewis the young, king of France, with whom a treaty was con|cluded, on condition that Eu&s;tace &s;on of Stephen &s;hould marry the French king's &s;i&s;ter Con&s;tance, and be inve&s;ted by his brother-in-law with the dutchy of Norman|dy. Then Stephen, a&s;&s;embling his forces, re&s;olved to attack the count of Anjou, who had taken &s;everal places, and retired to Argentan, after having made an un|&s;ucce&s;sful attempt to &s;urprize Caen; but when the king had advanced as far as Li&s;ieux, a quarrel broke out between William d' Ypres, earl of Kent, and Renaud de St. Valery, about the chief command: the Boulonnois and Flemings in the army e&s;pou&s;ing the cau&s;e of William, and the Normans declaring for their countryman Renaud, a battle en&s;ued, and a great deal of blood was &s;hed on both &s;ides. Whether Stephen on this occa&s;ion favoured the foreign troops, in which he placed his chief confidence, or his favourite William d' Ypres was &s;o dete&s;ted by the Normans that they would not &s;erve under his command; certain it is, they abandoned his army; nor could Stephen, who overtook them at Ponteau de Mer, prevail upon their leaders Hugh de Gournay and young William de Warenne to return to their duty. Perplexed therefore in his own mind, and &s;u&s;|pecting the fidelity of all his Norman &s;ubjects, he was fain to purcha&s;e a truce for two years with Geoffrey Plantagenet, with an annuity of five thou&s;and marks for him, and another of two thou&s;and for his own brother Theobald de Blois, in lieu of his preten&s;ions to the dutchy. Notwith&s;tanding this accommodation, the civil war &s;till continued to rage among the Norman nobility; but Stephen, leaving William de Roumara and the vi&s;count Roger to appea&s;e the&s;e troubles, returned to England; while Robert, earl of Leice&s;ter, who had followed him into Normandy, &s;tayed behind, partly becau&s;e he did not care to tru&s;t him&s;elf in England with Stephen, who had already betrayed his jealou&s;y of Robert's con|duct,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch$ $word$ Ger. $word$ Wig.

This project was the effect of de&s;pair, to which the Engli&s;h were driven by the licentiou&s;ne&s;s and oppre&s;&s;ion exerci&s;ed by the foreign mercenaries, who plundered and burned the towns and villages, and impri&s;oned, tortured, and even murdered the wretched people with impunity, under chiefs who had built and erected ca&s;tles for the purpo&s;es of rapine.

<P>Mean while David, king of Scotland, having been formally refu&s;ed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Northumberland, to which he laid claim, invaded the northern parts of England; and Stephen marching with a &s;trong army to oppo&s;e his progre&s;s, the Scots retired to Roxburgh, where the king finding them too advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted to be attacked with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, and di&s;covering &s;ome treachery among his followers, retreated to the &s;outh, without having hazarded an action. The Scots were then at liberty to wa&s;te Northumberland with impunity; they took Norham, and dividing into different detachments, ravaged the whole country, committing every where the mo&s;t ba$barous outrages. At length, when the &s;um|mer was far advanced, their &s;cattered parties joining, they advanced as far as Bag|gamoor, about two miles from Northallerton in York&s;hire, where they were met by an Engli&s;h army, under the command of William, earl of Albemarle, accom|panied with Wa$ter E$pec, Roger Mowbray, Robert de Bruce, Bernard de Baliol, Walter de Gant, and all the northern barons. In a &s;ort of a wheel-car|riage they had erected a long pole, at the top of which was a cro&s;s, and under this a banner, from whence the battle that en&s;ued acquired the name of the bat|tle of the &s;tandard. Around this en&s;ign the Engli&s;h were drawn up in a firm compacted body, the front being compo&s;ed of pikemen and archers intermixed, to receive the fir&s;t &s;hock of the enemy. There was a di&s;pute in the Scotti&s;h army about the manner in which they &s;hould begin the attack: David and his princi|pal nobility were of opinion they &s;hould charge with their heavy-armed troops and bowmen; but the men of Galloway, who had no other than &s;light offen&s;ive weapons, in&s;i&s;ted upon the privilege of forming the van; and the di&s;pute grow|ing warm between Alan de Percy and the earl of Stratherne, the king, in order to prevent a mutiny, ordered the Gallovidians to take their po&s;t, and begin the battle. The &s;econd line was compo&s;ed of the borderers and lowlanders, com|manded by the prince of Scotland, under the direction of Eu&s;tace Fitzjohn, an Engli&s;h nobleman, who had been oppre&s;&s;ed by Stephen, and joined the Scots from re&s;entment. The body of re&s;erve con&s;i&s;ted of the highlanders and Mur|raymen, commanded by the king, attended by a body guard of Engli&s;h and Nor|man knights. The Gallo$idians marched up to the attack with three huzzas,
<PB N="283" REF="2920">
and charged the Engli&s;h lancemen with &s;uch fury that they gave ground; but they were &s;u&s;tained by the &s;econd line; and the a&s;&s;ailants, having no defen|&s;ive armour, were galled in &s;uch a manner by the Engli&s;h arrows and pu&s;h of pike, that their fir&s;t fire being exhau&s;ted, and their two chieftains Ulgerick and Donald &s;lain, they turned their backs and fled with great confu&s;ion. The prince of Scotland then advanced to the attack with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity that he bore down all before him, and even penetrated to the rear of the Engli&s;h, who, ter|rified at his &s;ucce&s;s, began to fall into di&s;order, and gave way, when their total defeat was prevented by the &s;tratagem of an old &s;oldier, who cutting off a man's $ead, erected it on the point of his &s;pear, and calling aloud, "Behold the head of the Scotch king," rallied the troops and renewed the battle. The Scots, con|founded at this apparition, and di&s;pirited by the flight of the Gallovidians, fought no longer with alacrity, but began to give ground on all quarters: nor could<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rieval de Bel.

<P>The fugitives, &s;eeing the royal banner &s;till di&s;played, were convinced of their king's being alive, and crouded around him in &s;uch numbers, that he was able to form a con&s;iderable body, with which he retreated in good order to Carlile, where he was on the third day after the battle, joined by his &s;on. The prince, finding him&s;elf with a few &s;oldiers in the heart of the Engli&s;h army during the engagement, had thrown away his badges of di&s;tinction, and mixed with the enemy, until he made &s;hift to e&s;cape through bye-ways to his father, who was di&s;con&s;olate at his being mi&s;&s;ing; and therefore thought him&s;elf happy in his return. David lo&s;t &s;ome thou&s;ands, not in the battle, but in the retreat of &s;cattered parties, who, in&s;tead of joining the royal banner, endeavoured to e&s;cape into their own country, and were ma&s;&s;acred by the inhabitants of the country through which they marched. Stephen was &s;o well plea&s;ed with this victory, that he conferred upon William of Albemarle the additional title of York&s;hire, and be&s;towed the earldom of Derby on Ferrers, by whom the other had been &s;o &s;trong|ly reinforced. David was not &s;o weakened or dejected by his defeat, but that he be&s;ieged the ca&s;tle of Werk; which he reduced by famine, nor would he be per|&s;uaded to make peace with Stephen, by all the remon&s;trances of the pope's legate Albericus, bi&s;hop of O&s;tia, &s;ent to England by Innocent II. to exerci&s;e a legatine juri&s;diction, and vi&s;it all the mona&s;teries and cathedrals in the kingdom. All that Albericus could obtain of David, was a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of ho&s;tilities for &s;ome months, during which, however, Stephen's queen Maud, who was David's niece, employed her good offices &s;o effectually that a treaty of peace was next year concluded at Durham, on condition that all the county of Northumberland &s;hould be ceded to Henry, prince of Scotland, except New-Ca&s;tle and Bamburgh, in lieu of which he &s;hould enjoy certain lands in the &s;outhern parts of the kingdom.

<P>The garri&s;on made &s;uch a vigorous defence that he was obliged to turn the &s;iege into a blockade, by rai&s;ing two forts in the neighbourhood; then he returned to Oxford, where he took a &s;tep that recovered his intere&s;t with the clergy. From the letter he had received in &s;uch outrageous terms from Robert, earl of Glouce&s;ter, he concluded that the &s;torm which had been long gathering was ready to bur&s;t; and that all the per&s;ons of di&s;tinction in England, who had been attached to the late king, were concerned in the con|&s;piracy again&s;t his crown. One of the mo&s;t powerful of the&s;e was Roger, bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury, who had been rai&s;ed by Henry from a &s;imple cure in Nor|mandy to the &s;ee of Sarum, and &s;uch a &s;hare of that king's confidence that he in a manner governed the whole kingdom, and acquired va&s;t wealth and influ|ence, which he afterwards employed again&s;t the daughter and heir of his be|nefactor, in favour of an u&s;urper, by whom he was neglected. At length, he incurred the &s;u&s;picion of Stephen, becau&s;e he had, in con&s;equence of the general permi&s;&s;ion, fortified old Sarum, and built the ca&s;tles of Sherburn, Malme&s;bury, and the Devizes; while his nephew Alexander, bi&s;hop of Lincoln, erected tho&s;e<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brompton.</NOTE> of Newark and Sleford. The king, therefore, at his return to Oxford, invited and required his pre&s;ence at court, on pretence of con&s;ulting him in &s;ome affair of con&s;equence: he accordingly went thither, accompanied by his two nephews the bi&s;hops of Lincoln and Ely, and was immediately taken into cu&s;tody with Alex|ander until they &s;hould deliver up their ca&s;tles. Nigel, bi&s;hop of Ely, who lodged in the &s;uburbs, made his e&s;cape to the Devizes, which William d'Ypres was &s;ent immediately to be&s;iege; but, the place making a &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance, Ro|ger was brought in per&s;on before it, and threatened with death, &s;hould they re|fu&s;e to &s;urrender. This expedient produced the de&s;ired effect. Nigel capitulated for his own liberty, and Stephen taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, found a trea&s;ure amounting<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ord.

<P>It was certainly the mo&s;t impolitic &s;tep he could have taken, at &s;uch a juncture, when he was threatened with &s;uch a dangerous inva&s;ion from abroad. The truce with Geoffrey Plantagenet being expired, that prince marched into the Contantin, the greate&s;t part of which he reduced to his obedience; Robert, earl of Glouce&s;ter, put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Caen and Bayeux; and he proceeded with long &s;trides towards an intire conque&s;t of Normandy.

Maud was obliged to connive at the violence and irregularity of her friends, to &s;ecure their adherence; and as Stephen could not pay his foreign mercenaries, they were allowed to live at free quarter, and commit the mo&s;t terrible outrages. In this deplorable anarchy, every moderate per&s;on in the kingdom &s;ighed for peace; and Henry, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, propo&s;ed a treaty.

<P>Robert immediately a&s;&s;embled his troops, and took the route to Lincoln, with his &s;on-in-law, at the head of his va&s;&s;als and &s;ome auxiliary Welch forces, and re&s;olving to &s;trike a deci&s;ive blow, pa&s;&s;ed a rivulet and mora&s;s, which Stephen deemed imprac$icable, and gave him battle without he&s;itation. The infantry, commanded by him&s;elf in per&s;on, compo&s;ed the center; the hor&s;e were formed into two wings, one of which con&s;i&s;ted of tho&s;e who had been de|prived of their honours and e&s;tates by Stephen; and the other was made up of Ralf's va&s;&s;als, under his own conduct; while the Welch, who were unprovided with defen&s;ive armour, con&s;tituted a &s;eparate body, po&s;ted at the extremity of the line. Stephen drew up his army in the &s;ame manner; one wing of Flemi&s;h and Breton c$valry, commanded by William d'Ypres and the earl of Albemarle; the other, compo&s;ed of Bretons and Engli&s;h, under count Alain of Dinan, Wal|leran de Mellent, Hugh Bigot, earl of Norfolk, Simon de Seules and William de Warenne, earls of Northampton and Surrey; and the king him&s;elf on foot,

in the center. William d' Ypres began the battle by attacking the Welch, who were ea&s;ily routed: but the earl of Che&s;ter &s;eeing them di&s;ordered in the pur&s;uit, charged them in flank, and broke them intirely, &s;o as that they never rallied. At the &s;ame time the Engli&s;h on the other wing of Glouce&s;ter's army, fired by their wrongs, threw away their lances, and fell in &s;word in hand among Ste|phen's cavaliers, who did not &s;tand the fir&s;t on&s;et, but fled in the utmo&s;t confu|&s;ion. Stephen, being thus left naked to the right and left, was &s;urrounded by the enemy; and though he acted the part of an able general, and for a long time &s;u&s;tained the battle again&s;t extraordinary odds and efforts, he was at length obliged to yield to the adver&s;e fortune of the day.

<P>Immediately after this deci&s;ive battle, William Peverel &s;urrendered the ca&s;tle of Nottingham to the empre&s;s; tho&s;e of the Devizes and Bedford were yielded to her at the &s;ame time; and the earl of Warwick and all England abandoned the captive king, except the city of London and the county of Kent, in which William of Ypres his favourite, and &s;ome other partizans, &s;till adhered to his queen, and &s;on Eu&s;tace. Such barons, as &s;till pre&s;erved their allegiance, entered into the corporations and common-council of London, and prevailed upon them to form an a&s;&s;ociation in favour of the king. Though the greate&s;t part of the kingdom had declared for Maud, &s;he found &s;till an ob&s;tacle to her a&s;cending the throne; and that was Henry, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, inve&s;ted by the pope with legatine power, which placed him at the head of the clergy, who&s;e re&s;olutions, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, would have a great influence on the people and the nobility. In order to detach this prelate from his brother's intere&s;t, &s;he vi|&s;ited him at Winche&s;ter, and promi&s;ed to be guided wholly by his coun&s;els, and even to leave the vacant bi&s;hoprics to his di&s;po&s;al. The&s;e were temp|tations which he could not re&s;i&s;t. He promi&s;ed to abandon his brother, and devote him&s;elf entirely to her &s;ervice; as a proof of his &s;incerity, he &s;wore allegiance to her in private, though it was a conditional oath, binding him no longer than &s;he &s;hould continue to act according to her promi&s;e. Next day he received her with great &s;olemnity in the cathedral church, where he ex|communicated all the parti&s;ans of Stephen, and offered ab&s;olution to all tho&s;e who &s;hould for&s;ake him, and e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of the empre&s;s. Henry's exam|ple was followed by the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who did not however take the oaths to Maud, until he had obtained the con&s;ent of the king, whom he vi|&s;ited<NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

<P>The legate having undertaken to bring the clergy over to Maud's intere&s;t, a&s;&s;embled a general council at Winche&s;ter, and before the opening of the &s;e&s;&s;ion conferred with every member in private, to prepare him for the de|claration he intended to make. The council being a&s;&s;embled, he pronounced a &s;tudied harangue, in which he ob&s;erved, that the tyranny, bad faith, and mi&s;conduct of Stephen, were the real &s;ources of all the troubles that afflicted the nation. He owned that he him&s;elf had engaged his word for him, when the circum&s;tances of affairs made it nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e him to the throne: but he had been grievou&s;ly mi&s;taken in his opinion of the man, and it was with unfeign|ed &s;orrow he found him&s;elf obliged to renounce that engagement. He remind|ed them of the fir&s;t oath he had taken to the empre&s;s; and &s;aid it was more righteous to obey the order of God almighty, who had declared in favour of that prince&s;s, than to &s;acrifice his duty to the intere&s;ts and ambition of a carnal brother, whom he had done all that lay in his power to reclaim, though with|out effect; that the judgment of heaven having overtaken him whom they had cho&s;en, they ought to make atonement for their fault, in re&s;toring the crown to the lawful heire&s;s; and that, after having deliberated with the principal members of the clergy, upon mea&s;ures for putting a &s;top to the calamities of the nation, he had, by virtue of the apo&s;tolic power with which he was inve&s;ted, thought proper to acknowledge Maud, daughter of the late king Henry, queen and &s;o|vereign of England.</P>

<P>All the members, who had not been privately clo&s;eted, were in|finitely &s;urpri&s;ed at this declaration; but as no individual would venture to ex|pre&s;s his di&s;like, the legate interpreted their &s;ilence into approbation, and gave them to under&s;tand, that he had &s;ummoned the Londoners to this council, where they promi&s;ed to appear. Next day the deputies from that city ar|rived; but, far from approving of the new election, they demanded, in the name of their con&s;tituents, that the king &s;hould be &s;et at liberty. The legate replied, that it ill became the citizens of London to a&s;&s;ociate with tho&s;e barons who had &s;o ba&s;ely abandoned their king in battle; and who&s;e &s;ole aim was to involve the country in fre&s;h troubles. The deputies demanded a categorical an&s;wer, which however they could not obtain; and therefore they prote&s;ted again&s;t the tran&s;actions of the council. A chaplain belonging to Stephen's queen pre&s;ented a letter to the legate from that prince&s;s; but as he did not choo&s;e to communicate the contents to the a&s;&s;embly, he re&s;tored it to the bearer, who read it aloud. The purport of this addre&s;s was to demand her hu&s;band's en|largement; but it met with no regard from the audience; and the &s;e&s;&s;ion was concluded with the &s;entence of excommunication denounced again&s;t all Stephen's adherents. <NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

He had a&s;ked the counties of Boulogne and Montague, for Stephen's &s;on Eu|&s;tace, and met with a peremptory denial, which was &s;o oppo&s;ite to the profe&s;|&s;ions of Maud before her election, that he perceived he had nothing to hope from her good-will or conde&s;cen&s;ion. He therefore deemed him&s;elf acquitted of his engagement, and began to project &s;chemes of revenge, which &s;he her&s;elf facilitated by her pride and imperious conduct. In&s;tead of conciliating the af|fections of her &s;ubjects by affability and popular conce&s;&s;ions, &s;he affected to treat them as &s;laves born for her &s;ervice.

The citizens did not fail to murmur at this in&s;tance of her haughty and inflexi|ble di&s;po&s;ition; the nation began to pity the di&s;tre&s;s of Stephen and his family; they recognized and trembled at the &s;pirit of the Conqueror, which manife&s;ted i$&s;elf &s;o early in the deportment of his grand-daughter; and they heartily repent|ed the &s;teps they had taken in her favour.</P>

With the&s;e he advanced into Surrey, and blocking up London on the &s;ide of Southwark, &s;ent detached parties to make excur&s;ions on the other &s;ide of the river, and ravage the country to the very &s;uburbs. In order to co-ope|rate with the&s;e proceedings, the Londoners, in&s;tigated by the bi&s;hop's emi&s;&s;a|ries, formed a con&s;piracy for &s;eizing the per&s;on of the empre&s;s, who being ac|cidently informed of their purpo&s;e, retired with great precipitation, attended by her uncle David, her brother Glouce&s;ter, and Mi$o, whom &s;he had by this<NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

The bi&s;hop, who at once perceived her drift, returned an ambiguous an&s;wer, that he was getting ready as fa&s;t as he could; but in&s;tead of going to the palace, he forthwith quitted the town, and a&s;&s;embled his friends, who were prepared to join him on the fir&s;t notice. The troops of Kent and the militia of London being already in the field under the command of Stephen's queen and his &s;on, directed by William d'Ypres, they marched forthwith to Winche&s;ter with &s;uch expedition, that Maud's uncle David and her brother, with the earl of Hereford, and a few troops a&s;&s;embled in a hurry, had &s;carce time to reinforce her in the ca&s;tle before &s;he found her|&s;elf be&s;ieged. Henry was joined by a number of young nobility, flu&s;hed with<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. Malme&s;b.</NOTE> &s;pirits and ambition, who &s;eized this opportunity of retrieving the reputation they had lo&s;t in the battle of Lincoln, and executed Henry's re&s;entment again&s;t the inhabitants of Winche&s;ter, who had exhibited &s;ome marks of affection for the empre&s;s. In order to puni&s;h them for this unlucky attachment, their good bi&s;hop ordered wildfire and combu&s;tibles to be thrown by engines from his ca&s;tle upon the town, &s;o as to produce a conflagration, that reduced great part of it to a&s;hes, and among other buildings, con&s;umed a nunnery and twenty churches within the walls, and in the &s;uburbs the abbey of Hyde, from which, however, the bi&s;hop re&s;erved for his own u&s;e a ma&s;&s;y golden cup &s;tudded with &s;tones, the gift of King Canute, and three royal diadems, with &s;tands of the pure&s;t Arabian gold, adorned with jewels, and curious workman&s;hip. While the holy legate thus rained fire and de&s;truction on his flock, William d' Ypres acted the &s;ame tragedy at Andover, and burned the nunnery of Warewell, to which &s;ome of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Contin.

<P>Tho' the ca&s;tle of Winche&s;ter was now clo&s;ely be&s;ieged by an army amounting to &s;ixty thou&s;and men, David, king of Scotland, and Robert, earl of Glouce&s;ter, made &s;uch a vigorous defence, that after the a&s;&s;ailants had carried on their operations above &s;ix weeks, they retained very little hope of reducing the be|&s;ieged by force of arms; the pious bi&s;hop therefore had recour&s;e to a &s;tratagem, by which he turned religion to good account. On the eve of Holy rood day, he ordered peace to be proclaimed in the town, and the gates to be &s;et wide open, inviting all per&s;ons foes as well as friends to celebrate that great fe&s;tival of chri&s;tianity without fear of interruption. Though earl Robert did not altogether depend upon the pre|late's &s;incerity, yet as their provi&s;ion was quite exhau&s;ted, and famine mu&s;t have compelled them to &s;urrender in a few days at di&s;cretion, he re&s;olved, with the con&s;ent of David, to make an attempt for conveying the empre&s;s to a place of &s;afety. With this view he committed her to the charge of her brother Reginald, earl of Cornwal, &s;upported by the be&s;t part of the garri&s;$n, with direction to make the be&s;t of their way towards the Devizes, while he him&s;elf followed with a choice party of two hundred men, to amu&s;e the enemy, in ca&s;e they &s;hould attempt to in|tercept her. With this guard the empre&s;s &s;et out on hor&s;eback, and had not proceeded a great way when William d' Ypres began the pur&s;uit. The earl of Glouce&s;ter and David interpo&s;ed, and made &s;uch a gallant defence that Maud ac|compli&s;hed her e&s;cape to the ca&s;tle of Lutger&s;hal in Wilt&s;hire; which finding un|provided and indefen&s;ible, &s;he was obliged to di&s;gui&s;e her&s;elf in man's apparel, and ride forward to the Devizes, where &s;he arrived &s;o fatigued that &s;he could not pro&s;e|cute

A body was immediately &s;ent in pur&s;uit of the empre&s;s, who finding no &s;afety at the Devizes, and under&s;tanding the whole adjacent country was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the enemy, allowed her&s;elf to be inclo&s;ed in a bier, which pa&s;&s;ed along unfu&s;pected, and conveyed her to Glouce&s;ter, where<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hagul$tad.

<P>Robert was no &s;ooner in the hands of Stephen's party than they exerted all their endeavours to debauch him from the cau&s;e of his &s;i&s;ter; they offered him the government of the whole realm, under Stephen, if he would em|brace the intere&s;t of that prince; and, finding him deaf to their promi&s;es, threatened to &s;end him beyond &s;ea, and commit him clo&s;e pri&s;oner in Boulogne. He was equally unmoved by their menaces and flattery, and bore his captivity with the mo&s;t heroic fortitude. Then they propo&s;ed that he &s;hould be exchanged for Stephen; but this propo&s;ition he rejected as an unfair exchange, unle&s;s they would at the &s;ame time relea&s;e all the per&s;ons of di&s;tinction they had taken; &s;o as to make up the difference between his rank and that of Stephen. This expedient, how|ever, was rejected by William d' Ypres, who would not part with the pro&s;pect of ran&s;om. At length, as Robert was the &s;oul of his &s;i&s;ter's cau&s;e, &s;he agreed that he &s;hould be exchanged for Stephen, whom neverthele&s;s &s;he would not relea&s;e un|til his queen &s;urrendered her&s;elf as an ho&s;tage for the liberty of Glouce&s;ter.

This nobleman on the contrary, no &s;ooner recovered his freedom than he applied him&s;elf with redoubled diligence to the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of his &s;i&s;ter's affairs: while the legate convoked a council, in which, after Stephen had made a &s;peech, complain|ing of his impri&s;onment and the infidelity of his &s;ubjects, the bi&s;hop made an aukward apology for the incon&s;i&s;tency of his own conduct, by imputing it to the nece&s;&s;ity of the times. He &s;aid the empre&s;s had not only broke the &s;tipulations &s;he had made with him before her election, but likewi&s;e formed de&s;igns again&s;t his life and dignity; and concluded with a &s;entence of excommunication denounced again&s;t all di&s;turbers of the peace, who favoured the cau&s;e of the counte&s;s of Anjou.

<P>About the time of the earl's departure from England, Stephen had been &s;eized with a dangerous fever, which reduced him to the brink of the grave; but, as &s;oon as he recovered, he a&s;&s;embled a body of troops, and marching to Wareham, burned the town, and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the ca&s;tle; then he di|rected his march to Oxford, and arrived at that place &s;o unexpectedly that he entered the city before any mea&s;ures could be taken for its defence, and immedi|ately inve&s;ted the ca&s;tle, in which the empre&s;s was cooped up with no other gar|ri&s;on than her ordinary guard and the officers of her hou&s;ehold. The noble|men, who had engaged to defend her in her brother's ab&s;ence, immediately a&s;&s;embled their forces, and advanced as far as Wallingford, to give battle to Ste|phen; but he would not quit the city of Oxford, which was too well fortified for them to be&s;iege with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. Robert, being appri&s;ed of Maud's danger, embarked immediately for England, with her &s;on Henry and four hun|dred men at arms, and landing at Wareham inve&s;ted the ca&s;tle without delay, in expectation that Stephen would rai&s;e the &s;iege of Oxford ca&s;tle, and march to its relief; but that prince was &s;o intent upon having the empre&s;s in his power that he would not interrupt his operations for one moment; &s;o that the ca&s;tle of Ware|ham capitulated. From thence the earl marched to Cirence&s;ter, which he had<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Maud, taking advantage of this relaxation, came out at a po&s;tern gate, attended by four knights dre&s;&s;ed in white, that they might not be ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from the &s;now, and cro&s;&s;ing the river upon the ice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ge&s;t.

<P>This officer's captivity was one of the greate&s;t con&s;equences of the victory, ina&s;much as the ca&s;tle of Sherburn was given up for his ran&s;om; and about the &s;ame time Henry de Tracy, who had hitherto kept alive a party for Stephen in Devon&s;hire, de&s;pairing of &s;eeing that prince firmly &s;ettled on the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Geft.

That part of Wales inhabited by the Engli&s;h, and the counties lying on the &s;ide of the Severne, had declared for Maud, and obeyed her government. The bi&s;hopric of Durham and the three northern counties po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by David, king of Scotland, acknowledged her &s;overeignty. William, earl of York&s;hire, who adhered to Stephen, was balanced by Alain, earl of Richmond; while Ralf, earl of Che&s;ter, Hugh Bigot, earl of Norfolk, and the noblemen of Ea&s;t-Anglia, maintained a &s;ort of independent regality within their &s;everal di&s;tricts, though they were contented to recognize Stephen for their &s;overeign. The &s;eat of the war therefore was chiefly confined to Berk|&s;hire and the parts adjacent, and carried on in &s;ieges and blockades of ca&s;tles, or &s;light &s;hirmi&s;hes of detached parties; for Stephen was by this time di&s;abled from<NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

The empre&s;s about the &s;ame time was afflicted with the lo&s;s of a faithful and con&s;ide|rable adherent in the death of Milo, whom &s;he had created earl of Hereford, a title that now devolved to his &s;on Roger, who, though a nobleman of courage and fidelity, wanted the weight and experience of his father.</P>

<P>Stephen &s;eems to have been infected with the rage of building ca&s;tles; for he &s;eldom attempted to take one fortre&s;s without building another, and the governors he appointed very often &s;et up for them&s;elves; &s;o that he not only multiplied tyrants to oppre&s;s the country, but rai&s;ed &s;o many bulwarks again&s;t his own intere&s;t. He was al&s;o very much addicted to jealou&s;y; and once his &s;u&s;picion was arou&s;ed, he never waited for conviction, but took immediate &s;teps for his own intere&s;t and convenience, without any regard to gratitude or ju&s;tice. Geoffry de Magneville, a nobleman of great parts and va&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, he had created earl of E&s;&s;ex, and appointed governor of the Tower of London; but Stephen, giving ear to the &s;ugge&s;tions of Geoffrey's enemies, who repre&s;ented him as a &s;ecret favourer of the empre&s;s, cau&s;ed him to be arre&s;ted at St. Alban's, on pretence of a tumult rai&s;ed on purpo&s;e, and refu&s;ed to relea&s;e him until he had given up the Tower, as well as his own ca&s;tles of Walden and Ple&s;hy, near Dunmow in E&s;&s;ex.

He was afterwards joined by Hugh Bigot, who declared for the empre&s;s; and the&s;e two noblemen ravaged the whole country, making excur&s;ions even to the neighbourhood of London, upon the citizens of which Stephen's chief dependence re&s;ted: at length Geoffrey was accidentally killed by an arrow at the &s;iege of Burwelle ca&s;tle: and Stephen marching again&s;t Bigot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ge&s;t.

Notwith&s;tand|ing the&s;e proofs of his &s;incerity and attachment, he could not overcome the &s;u&s;|picion of Stephen, who&s;e jealou&s;y was founded upon his omitting to re&s;ign &s;ome royal ca&s;tles that were in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. He therefore took the fir&s;t opportu|nity of Ralf's being at court, to demand immediate re&s;titution of the&s;e fortre&s;&s;es; and upon the earl's de&s;iring a little time to con&s;ult his friends upon the &s;ubject, he was charged with high trea&s;on and taken into cu&s;tody.

<P>Her friends did not de&s;i&s;t from action at her departure; becau&s;e by this time Stephen had rendered him&s;elf odious to the whole nation, and the no|bility knew how little they could depend upon his faith. Perhaps he might have profited by the ab&s;ence of Maud, notwith&s;tanding the enmity of tho&s;e no|blemen whom he had &s;o outrageou&s;ly injured, had not he involved him&s;elf in a quarrel with the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, which had very unfavourable con|&s;equences for his intere&s;t, and the kingdom in general. He and his brother Henry were exa$perated at pope Eugenius III. for having be&s;towed the legatine power upon Theobald, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, whom they dete&s;ted; and the chapter of York perceiving that the animo&s;ity was equal on both &s;ides, took this opportunity of complaining to his holine&s;s, that William, the nephew of Stephen, had been intruded into their &s;ee by royal authority, without a cano|nical election: that prelate was therefore deprived in the council held at Rheims, in Champaign. The pope having &s;ummoned Theobald of Canterbury, with the bi&s;hops of Worce&s;ter, Bath, Exeter, and Chiche&s;ter, to attend at this council, Stephen, at the in&s;tigation of his brother, forbad the metropolitan to leave the kingdom, hoping, that if he &s;hould forbear to go thither, he would be &s;u&s;pend|ed or deprived for contempt of the pope's order; and re&s;olving, if he &s;hould leave England, notwith&s;tanding the prohibition, to &s;eize his revenues, and treat him as an outlaw. Theobald under&s;tanding that the ports were guarded to pre|vent his voyage, embarked in an open boat, and arriving &s;afely on the continent, proceeded to the council; and after it broke up returned to Canterbury, where he found his revenues &s;eque&s;tered by order of the king, who went thither and commanded him to depart the kingdom. During his exile this prelate, in let|ters<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1148.</NOTE> which he wrote to &s;everal churches in England, threatened them with an interdict to commence at a certain day; and the monks of St. Augu&s;tine peti|tioning the pope to prevent it, were ordered to obey the archbi&s;hop's commands. Theobald, arriving in Suffolk, was honourably received and protected by Hugh Bigot, earl of Norfolk, and, at the appointed time, publi&s;hed the interdict again&s;t all the churches which acknowledged Stephen. Divine &s;ervice immediate|ly cea&s;ed in all the parts &s;ubjected to that king, while it was celebrated as u&s;ual in all tho&s;e which obeyed the empre&s;s; a di&s;tinction that produced a very &s;en|&s;ible effect among the people.

<P>Mean while Stephen, alarmed at the power and capacity of Henry, re&s;olved if po&s;&s;ible to anticipate the purpo&s;e of his coming to England, by de|priving him of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in a legal manner: for this purpo&s;e he convoked a great council at London, in order to procure their &s;anction to his de&s;ign of a&s;&s;o|ciating his &s;on Eu&s;tace in the government, and the lay nobility that were pre&s;ent a&s;&s;ented to the propo&s;al: but when he expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of proceeding immediately to the coronation of that prince, Theobald, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who had already received in&s;tructions from the pope on that &s;ubject, refu&s;ed to perform the ceremony, and the re&s;t of the bi&s;hops joined in this refu&s;al. Stephen, incen&s;ed at their pre&s;umption, ordered them to be locked up in an apartment, and en|deavoured to terrify them into compliance; but all his menaces proved ineffec|tual. The archbi&s;hop found means to e&s;cape from the place of his confine|ment, and, cro&s;&s;ing the Thames in a boat, travelled with great expedition to Dover, where he embarked for France.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the conferences for a peace, there was no ce&s;&s;a|tion of ho&s;tilities.

That Stephen &s;hould reign dur|ing life, and ju&s;tice be admini&s;tered in his name; though nothing of con&s;equence &s;hould be tran&s;acted without the advice and concurrence of Henry, who &s;hould &s;ucceed him on the throne, and in the mean time receive ho&s;tages for the deli|very of the royal ca&s;tles at his decea&s;e; and that Stephen's &s;on William &s;hould inherit all the lands his father po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in England and Normandy before he a&s;|cended the throne, together with the e&s;tate of William de Warenne, who&s;e daughter he had married, and &s;even hundred pounds a year in the county of Norfolk, for which he &s;hould do homage, and give pledge for his fidelity to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer's Foe|dera.</NOTE> Henry.</P>

<P>This accommodation, to the ob&s;ervance of which an oath was taken by all the nobility and prelates, filled the whole kingdom with unutterable joy, and the two princes entered London together, with the utmo&s;t pomp and mag|nificence: indeed it was a mo&s;t happy event to the nation, which had been &s;o long a prey to all the mi&s;eries of a civil war; nor was it le&s;s fortunate for Ste|phen, who now found him&s;elf a king in reality. Henry having received the ho|mage of the Londoners, as heir apparent to the throne, the king and he parted to &s;pend the Chri&s;tmas holidays in different places; but they &s;oon met again at Oxford in a great council of the nation, when all the nobility and bi&s;hops took the oath of allegiance to Henry, with a re&s;ervation of obedience to Stephen<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>The good under&s;tanding between the princes was not of long duration; for, at a &s;ub&s;equent a&s;&s;embly convened at Dun&s;taple, Henry complained of Stephen's having neglected to demoli&s;h all the ca&s;tles which had been built &s;ince
<PB N="300" REF="3090">
the war began, according to a &s;tipulation in the treaty; and Stephen flatly refu&s;|ed to give him &s;atisfaction upon this article. Neverthele&s;s Henry did not ex|pre&s;s any re&s;entment, and the king and he &s;et out together for Dover to receive Theodoret, earl of Flanders, and his dutche&s;s, who had arrived in England. During their re&s;idence in this place, a con&s;piracy is &s;aid to have been formed again&s;t Henry's life, by the Flemings, who had &s;ettled in great numbers under the protection of William d'Ypres, earl of Kent; and Stephen's &s;on William is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the author of this infamous de&s;ign. But, that prince's leg being fractured by a fall from his hor&s;e on Barham Downs, their mea&s;ures<NOTE PLACE="marg">C$$on. Norm.

<P>This con&s;piracy is of doubtful credit; ina&s;much as we cannot &s;uppo&s;e that Henry would have left the kingdom, where he had &s;uch powerful adherents, without taking any &s;tep towards a detection of the plot, that the accomplices might be p$ni$hed. His voyage to Normandy was occa&s;ioned by an inva&s;ion of the king of France, who had entered his Norman dominions and taken Ver|non; but being baffled in his attempt upon Vernueil, and &s;eeing Henry, at the head of a &s;trong army in the field, ready to oppo&s;e his progre&s;s, he thought proper to accept of peace, on condition of re&s;toring Vernon and Neumarch&eacute;, and receiving two thou&s;and marks of &s;ilver to defray the expence of fortifying the&s;e two places. After this peace Henry gradually re&s;umed the deme&s;nes of his dut|chy, which his father had alienated to engage the Norman barons in his intere&s;t; and the&s;e mea&s;ures he pur&s;ued in &s;uch a manner, that the tranquillity of his do|minions<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr.

<P>Mean while, Stephen having made another vi&s;it to the earl of Flan|ders, was on his return to Canterbury &s;eized with the iliac pa&s;&s;ion, which put an end to his life; and his body was interred by that of his wife Mathilda, in the abbey of Fever&s;ham, which he him&s;elf had founded. Stephen was a prince of great courage, fortitude, and activity; and might have reigned with the appro|bation of his people, had not he been harra&s;&s;ed by the efforts of a powerful com|petitor, which obliged him to take &s;uch mea&s;ures for his &s;afety, as were incon|&s;i&s;tent with the dictates of honour, which indeed his ambition prompted him to forego in his fir&s;t endeavours to a&s;cend the throne. His nece&s;&s;ities afterwards compelled him to infringe the charter of privileges he granted at his acce&s;&s;ion; and he was in&s;tigated by his jealou&s;y and re&s;entment to commit the mo&s;t flagrant outrages again&s;t gratitude and $ound policy. His vices as a king &s;eem to have been the effect of the troubles in which he was involved; for, as a man, he was brave, open, and liberal, and, during the &s;hort calm that &s;ucceeded the tempe&s;ts of his reign, he made a progre&s;s through the kingdom, publi&s;hed an edict to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brompton.

<P>After having taken all the&s;e precautions to &s;trengthen his own hands and ree&s;tabli&s;h the public tranquillity, he cho&s;e for his council, per&s;ons the mo&s;t eminent for their wi&s;dom, both of the clergy and laity: among others Theobald, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and Thomas Becket, archdeacon of the &s;ame church lately made high chamberlain, and Robert, earl of Leice&s;ter, high ju&s;ticiary of the kingdom. At the head of his privy council was his mother Mathilda, who, though re&s;iding on the continent, directed all the deliberations of con&s;equence from that &s;agacity which &s;he obtained by long experience and vici&s;&s;itude of for|tune. By the advice of the&s;e coun&s;ellors, he convoked a general a&s;&s;embly or parliament, in which &s;ome regulations were made for the intere&s;t of the realm; the ancient cu&s;toms and laws of Edward the Confe&s;&s;or, adopted by his grand|father Henry I. were re&s;tored; and a charter granted under the great &s;eal, con|firming to the church, the barons, and va&s;&s;als, all the cu&s;toms, donations, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

<P>Another extraordinary council was &s;ummoned at Wallingford, where the members &s;wore allegiance to Henry and his two &s;ons William and Henry as eventual &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, though then in the &s;tate of infancy; and other laws were enacted for the benefit of the people. The kingdom immediately a&s;&s;umed a new face, agriculture and manufacture returned with &s;ecurity, and every individual &s;eemed to enjoy the happy effects of the new government. Neverthele&s;s Henry found it impracticable to rule &s;o as to avoid the di&s;content of all his &s;ubjects. Several no|blemen re&s;ented the proclamation for demoli&s;hing the ca&s;tles, and among the&s;e the chief was William le Gro&s;s, earl of Albemarle, who had va&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the north, where he had acted, during Stephen's reign, with &s;overeign power; he was already deprived of the title of York, which he had received from that prince, and perhaps his re&s;entment partly influenced him in refu&s;ing to deliver up the ca&s;tle of Scarborough, which he had rendered almo&s;t impregnable. But the king marching into York&s;hire, he at length &s;ubmitted. Henry had another de&s;ign in going northward, which was to puni&s;h William Peverel for having poi&s;oned Ralf, earl of Che&s;ter. The murderer, con&s;cious of his crime, and dreading the ju&s;tice of the law, had already turned monk in the mona&s;tery of Linton; but, thinking him&s;elf un&s;afe in the protection of the habit, he fled from the country

at the approach of the king, who &s;eized all his ca&s;tles and e&s;tate, as the forfeiture of a felon. It was about this period that Henry, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, quitting the kingdom without leave, Henry ordered all his ca&s;tles to be levelled with the ground, though he could not &s;ecure the prelate's trea&s;ure, which he had found means<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron.

From the northern counties, Henry directed his march to the frontiers of Wales, where Hugh de Mortimer had fortified his ca&s;tles of Bridgnorth, Clebery, and Wigmore; and prevailed upon Roger, earl of Hereford, to join him in his re|volt, rather than part with his fortre&s;&s;es of Hereford and Glouce&s;ter. This no|bleman, however, was reclaimed by the remon&s;trances of his kin&s;man, Gilbert Foliat, bi&s;hop of Hereford, who procured the king's pardon in his behalf; and Hugh, after having &s;een his three ca&s;tles reduced by the royal forces, was fain to &s;ue for mercy, which he obtained in con&s;ideration of giving up all the crown<NOTE PLACE="marg">Id.</NOTE> deme&s;nes that were in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

This revolt was altogether as un&s;ucce&s;sful as the fir&s;t; for the king reduced and retained his ca&s;tles, though in lieu of the&s;e he gave him lands in the open country, a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in keeping po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Nantes, the people of which had cho&s;en him for their &s;ove|reign, and allowed him a very con&s;iderable annuity, in con&s;equence of his &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion. The king having quieted this di&s;turbance, and received homage from the nobility of Guienne, he returned to England, and rai&s;ed a great army, in order to make a conque&s;t of Wales, and marched into F$int&s;hire again&s;t Owen Guy|nath, prince of North Wales, who lay incamped at Be&s;ingwerk. When he under|&s;tood the Engli&s;h were advancing through a wood called Coel Eulo, he &s;uddenly attacked their van with &s;uch fury, that &s;everal officers of di&s;tinction were &s;lain, and the whole divi&s;ion would have been cut in pieces had not the king come &s;ea|&s;onably to their &s;uccour: the di&s;order among the Engli&s;h was in a great mea&s;ure owing to the cowardice of the earl of E&s;&s;ex, who threw away the &s;tandard, and fled with great precipitation, crying aloud the king was &s;lain. An in&s;tance of mi&s;conduct for which he was afterwards accu&s;ed of high trea&s;on by Simon de<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fowel's Hift. of Wale$.</NOTE> Montfort, who proving him guilty by vanqui&s;hing him in &s;ingle combat, he was &s;horn a monk, and confined to the mona&s;tery of Reading. Henry, find|ing how dangerous it was to march precipitately through unknown woods and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

By this method he continued his march without further di&s;turbance to Snowdun, where Guynath and his barons finding them&s;elves unable to oppo&s;e his progre&s;s, &s;ued for peace, &s;wore fealty, delivered ho&s;tages, and re&s;tored all the ca&s;tles and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron.

<P>On his arrival in his foreign dominions, he had a conference with Lewis VII. of France on the river Epte, which &s;eparated their territories, and there agreed upon a match between young Henry and Margaret daughter of Lewis, both infants. Thence Henry accompanied the French king to Paris; and the young prince&s;s being delivered into his hands, he committed the care of her education to Robert de Newbourg, ju&s;ticiary of Normandy. Such was the mutual confi|dence<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brompton.</NOTE> that reigned between the two princes on this occa&s;ion, that Henry was created grand &s;ene&s;chal of France; a title of which he availed him&s;elf in his de|&s;igns upon the county of Nantes, which he claimed as heir to his brother Geoffrey. He was the more able to undertake an enterprize of this kind, as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the territories that &s;urrounded Brittany, and acted as guardian to the young count of Flanders left under his tuition by count Thierry, when he departed on his expedition to Jeru&s;alem. Conan, count of Brittany, had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Nantes on the death of Geoffrey, who had no title to the country, but the &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion and choice of the inhabitants, after they had relinqui&s;hed their allegiance to their natural &s;overeign. Conan, notwith&s;tanding his title, which was un|que&s;tionable, &s;ubmitted to Henry upon being &s;ummoned to &s;urrender the inheri|tance of Geoffrey; becau&s;e he fore&s;aw that oppo&s;ition or non-compliance $ould bring upon him the re&s;entment of a powerful king, and infallibly deprive him of the earldom of Richmond, which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in England, of more value than the country in di&s;pute; he therefore ceded it to Henry, who&s;e next care was to &s;ettle all differences &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between him and the princes contiguous to Normandy; yet before he quitted Brittany he agreed with Conan upon a match between that prince's daughter Con&s;tance and his &s;on Geoffrey, who was now in the cradle: a marriage in con&s;equence of which Geoffrey became duke of Bretagne upon the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch.

<P>Henry, not yet &s;atisfied with this addition of Nantes, the exten&s;ive do|minions he formerly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and the pro&s;pect of his &s;on's &s;ucceeding to Brittany, re&s;olved to revive his queen's preten&s;ions to the county of Tholou&s;e, in right of her grandfather William, count of Poitiers, who married Philippa, heire&s;s of William IV. count of Tholou&s;e. The&s;e dominions had been alienated to Ray|mond de St. Gilles, the younger brother of William, for a certain con&s;ideration, and the count of Poitiers afterwards confirmed the &s;ale for a &s;um of money; but Lewis the young when he married Eleanor &s;ole daughter and heire&s;s of William IX. count of Poitiers, pretended that the fir&s;t alienation to Raymond de St. Gilles, was no other than a collu&s;ion between him and his brother; and that the con|firmation was an impo&s;ition upon the &s;implicity of the count de Poitiers: he therefore alledged that the whole tran&s;action was null and void; and that Eleanor ought to enjoy the inheritance of her grandmother Philippa, upon re&s;toring the &s;um which the count of Poitiers had received for the confirmation of the pre|tended &s;ale. Raymond V. then count of Tholou&s;e, in vain pleaded pre&s;cription, which was a weak plea again&s;t the power of the French king, who threatened to make his preten&s;ions good by force of arms. Neverthele&s;s, after a long negotia|tion, the difference was terminated by the marriage of count Raymond with Con|&s;tance, the &s;i&s;ter of Lewis, and widow of Eu&s;tace, the &s;on of king Stephen.

<P>But now that &s;he was married to Henry, the &s;ame rights devolved to that ambitious prince, who accordingly claimed the country; and Raymond plead|ing the &s;ale and pre&s;cription, he re&s;olved to reduce it by the power of his &s;word.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 11$9.</NOTE> To defray the expences of this important enterprize, he rai&s;ed a very con&s;iderable &s;um of money, by taxing every noble fief in Normandy and his other foreign domi|nions; he allowed his tenants to commute their per&s;onal &s;ervice in the expedition for a certain pecuniary con&s;ideration, known by the name of Scutage; and this amounted to a large collection with which he enli&s;ted a &s;trong body of mercenary &s;oldiers. Leaving commi&s;&s;aries to levy the&s;e volunteers during the winter, he came over to England, and pa&s;&s;ed the Ea&s;ter holidays at Worce&s;ter, where he and his queen approaching the offertory, laid their crowns upon the high altar, vowing they would never wear them again; &s;o that an end was put to the &s;olemn coronations on great fe&s;tivals, which had hitherto taken place. Henry's de&s;ign, in coming to England at this juncture, was to rai&s;e from his Engli&s;h &s;ubjects &s;uch a &s;cutage as he had e&s;tabli&s;hed abroad; and this being levied he ha&s;ted over to Guienne, ac|companied by Malcolm, king of Scotland, whom he knighted on this expedition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoveden. $word$ St. Thom.</NOTE> William, count of Boulogne, and a great number of Engli&s;h nobility, who wanted to &s;ignalize their courage, and &s;erved as volunteers at their own expence.</P>

<P>He was joined on the continent by the troops of William, lord of Montpelier, and Trincavel, vi&s;count of Bezieres and Ni&s;mes.

Thus prepared, Henry attacked Cahors, the capital of Quercy, which he &s;oon compelled to &s;ur|render; then invading the county of Tholou&s;e, he reduced a great number of places; &s;o that the capital was almo&s;t wholly blocked up, when the king of France, the count's brother-in-law, marched to his &s;uccour with a &s;mall body of troops, and threw him&s;elf into the city. Henry was not a little a&s;toni&s;hed at this act of ho&s;tility from a prince with whom he had lately contracted an alliance and intimacy of friend&s;hip: and as it was deemed in tho&s;e days a breach of honour and duty in a va&s;&s;al to fight again&s;t his &s;overeign, he would not a&s;&s;ault a place de|fended by the king of France in per&s;on, notwith&s;tanding the advice of chancel|lor Becket <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Fitz&s;tep$ens, in his life of Becket, &s;ays that prelate had &s;even hundred knigh$s in his $word$ that be&s;ides the&s;e he maintained at his table, for forty days$ twelve hundred hor&s;emen, each of whom received of him three &s;hillings a day to provide for his hor&s;es and &s;quires; and that the number of all his dependants amounted to four thou&s;and men able to carry arms.</NOTE>, who importuned him to take Lewis pri&s;oner; an exploit which he might have ea&s;ily atchieved before the re&s;t of the French army could advance.</P>

Lewis, incen&s;ed at this ab|rupt manner of proceeding, per&s;uaded Theobald, count of Blois, who&s;e &s;i&s;ter Adela he had lately married, to fortify Chaumont for the convenience of making incur&s;ions into Tourraine: but Henry marching thither, reduced the fortre&s;s, and committed it to the care of Hugh d'Amboi&s;e. At the &s;ame time, he put a &s;trong garri&s;on into Fretteval and Amboi&s;e, &s;ecured the ca&s;tles of the count d' Evreux, and gave orders for repairing all the fortifications on the frontiers of his territories towards France; while he him&s;elf retired to Mans, where he propo&s;ed to &s;pend the winter.

To oppo&s;e the&s;e incur&s;ions Henry took the field; and, in the cour&s;e of their motions, the armies were more than once in &s;ight of each other; but neither of the kings caring to hazard a battle, they agreed to a ce&s;&s;ation of arms, during which &s;ome overtures were made for a peace, and the&s;e terminated in a temporary accommodation: Gi&s;ors, Neafle, Neufchatel, and the other places allotted to Margaret as her dowry, being committed by way of &s;eque&s;tration to the hands of Totes de St. Omer and Ro|bert<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

His apartments glittered with gold and &s;ilver plate; the very bridles of his hor&s;es were of &s;ilver, and nothing could exceed his equipage in mag|nificence. He retained a prodigious number of knights in his &s;ervice; and the nobility &s;ent their children to be educated as pages in his family: Prince Hen|ry was committed to his care and tuition; and the king went frequently to &s;ee the pomp of his entertainments. He employed two and fifty clerks in keeping the accounts of vacant prelacies, and his own eccle&s;ia&s;tical preferments; and every day he received pre&s;ents of hor&s;es, ve&s;tments, plate, or money. When he cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea, he was always attended by five &s;hips; and in his emba&s;&s;y to Paris, concerning the marriage of the prince&s;s Margaret, he appeared with a thou&s;and per&s;ons in his retinue, di&s;playing &s;uch wealth and grandeur, as amaz|ed the &s;pectators. He diverted him&s;elf in hawking, hunting, che&s;s-playing, and tilting, at which he was &s;o expert, that, while he &s;erved in Normandy, he un|hor&s;ed a French nobleman of approved valour, and carried off his cour&s;er in triumph. Thus, Thomas lived as chancellor Becket, but when, contrary to the advice of Maud the empre&s;s, he was promoted to the archbi&s;hopric of Can|terbury, his whole conduct took a new turn; his di&s;po&s;ition &s;eemed to undergo a total change: he now practi&s;ed all the &s;everities of church di&s;cipline, and at his con&s;ecration appeared to imbibe that &s;pirit of turbulence and pre&s;umption, which de&s;cended like an inheritance in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of that primacy.</P>

<P>Thomas being, by the king's command, elected archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, ordered the day of the con&s;ecration to be kept as the folemn fe&s;ti|val of the Holy Trinity, contrary to the practice of all other nations, who ce|lebrate this fea&s;t according to the proper computation; and he &s;ent the &s;eals to Henry, who had not yet left his foreign dominions. The king took umbrage at this in&s;olent re&s;ignation, implying a refu&s;al to give him any farther a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the affairs of &s;tate; and when that prelate went to court at his return, Hen|ry received him with a remarkable coldne&s;s of civility. This mi&s;under&s;tanding was increa&s;ed by Becket's conduct when he returned from the council of Tours, where pope Alexander had received him with extraordinary honours, and granted all the privileges he de&s;ired. Here a canon was enacted again&s;t the u&s;urpation of eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tates by the laity; and, in con&s;equence of this arti|cle, he, at his arrival in England, demanded of the king the ca&s;tle of Roche&s;ter, and the manors of Saltwode and Hethe, as belonging to the church of Canter|bury.<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. N$$b. Chr. G$rv$$$</NOTE> He likewi&s;e claimed an e&s;tate in Kent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by William de Ros, which had been granted to his &s;ee by Stephen, and afterwards re&s;umed by Hen|ry, among the other alienations; and pretended to the ca&s;tle and honour of
<PB N="310" REF="3190">
Tunbridge, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Roger, earl of Clare, great-grand&s;on to Richard Fitz-Gilbert, to whom it had been granted by William the Conqueror, for a valuable con&s;ideration of lands to an equal extent in Normandy. This grant had been confirmed by the archbi&s;hops of Canterbury; but Becket pretending that his predece&s;&s;ors had no power to alienate the property of the church, &s;um|moned Roger to do him homage. This claim equally alarmed and di&s;obliged the nobility, and the king had great rea&s;on to take umbrage at his proceedings; when he be&s;towed the church of Eynesford, in Kent, upon a creature of his own, afferting, that it was the prerogative of the archbi&s;hop, to fill all vacant<NOTE PLACE="marg">D$et Coll.</NOTE> churches in the manors of his military tenants, as well as of the monks of Can|terbury. The agents of Laurence, to whom he had given the church of Ey|nesford, being expelled by William, lord of the manor, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the ad|vow&s;on, Becket immediately excommunicated the expul&s;or, though he held of the crown, and was entitled to the benefit of an act pa&s;&s;ed in the reign of the Conqueror, importing, that no military tenant of the crown &s;hould be excom|municated without the knowledge of the king. This pre&s;umption was an addi|tional cau&s;e of di&s;gu&s;t to Henry, who, in a letter to the archbi&s;hop, de&s;ired William might be ab&s;olved, and received a flat refu&s;al. After &s;ome altercation, however, he at length complied, with a very ill grace, rather than incur the pe|nalties of a law, the breach of which amounted to high trea&s;on. The&s;e were the preludes to an open rupture between the king and archbi&s;hop.</P>

<P>During the preceding reign, a great number of idle and illiterate per&s;ons had, in order to enjoy the protection of the church, received holy orders, by the indulgence of the bi&s;hops, who ordained all that pre&s;ented them&s;elves; and as the&s;e, having no benefices, belonged to no dioce&s;e, con&s;equently were &s;ub|ject to no juri&s;diction, they committed the mo&s;t flagrant enormities with impu|nity. Though the canons condemned pluralities, one clergyman frequently po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;even churches and prebends, be&s;towed by the indulgence of prelates, who had al&s;o introduced the practice of commuting for penance; &s;o that the mo&s;t &s;candalous crimes were excu&s;ed for money, and all eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;cipline neg|lected. Before the death of Theobald, the king had complained of the&s;e di&s;or|ders to the bi&s;hops, who paid no regard to his remon&s;trance; becau&s;e they had laid it down as a maxim to give no &s;atisfaction to the crown touching the irre|gularities of the clergy. Thus exempted from puni&s;hment, the offenders open|ly<NOTE PLACE="marg">G Newberg. i$p ft. S.

Another who had &s;tolen a &s;ilver chalice out of a church in London, was demanded by the king, and denied by the arch|bi&s;hop, who neverthele&s;s puni&s;hed the delinquent &s;everely, becau&s;e his crime af|fected the church, and was deemed unpardonable &s;acrilege. Yet even on this occa&s;ion he encroached upon the civil power, by ordering the prie&s;t to be branded in the face with an hot iron; whereas the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court had no right to in|flict corporal puni&s;hment: &s;o that it was a flagrant inva&s;ion of the royal autho|rity, and &s;uch a dangerous precedent as not only incen&s;ed the king$ but alarmed the whole nation.

<P>The king did not require much &s;timulation to put a &s;top to this tyranny and inju&s;tice, which was &s;o enormous, that, in a very &s;hort &s;pace of time, above an hundred per&s;ons had been murdered by eccle&s;ia&s;tical ruffians, who were &s;creened from the penalties of the law. He therefore a&s;&s;embled the bi&s;hops at We&s;tmin&s;ter, where after having enumerated the di&s;orders ari&s;ing from the corruption of the &s;piritual court, in which the penalties of every crime were commuted for money; and expatiated upon the barbarous murders, which had been &s;o frequently com|mitted by clerical a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, he de&s;ired that one of his judges &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t at the trial of every infamous offender before the archdeacons; and that every murderer &s;hould be degraded from the prie&s;thood, and delivered over to the &s;ecular arm. Becket retired with the prelates to deliberate upon this propo&s;al, which appeared highly rea&s;onable to his brethren, who exhorted him to comply with the king's de&s;ire; but he entrenched him&s;elf behind the papal decrees and canons: affirm|ing, that it was contrary to the law of God, and the in&s;titutions of the church, for a delinquent to undergo a double judgment for one offence; that they were forbid to be concerned in &s;entences of blood; and therefore he would never con|&s;ent to expo&s;e any criminal eccle&s;ia&s;tic to capital puni&s;hment. Henry being ap|prized of their ob&s;tinacy, demanded if they would ob&s;erve the cu&s;toms of the crown, and the laws of the kingdom; and the archbi&s;hop an&s;wered in the name of the re&s;t, that they would obey them in all points that did not interfere with the rights of their order. Henry, di&s;&s;atisfied with this eva&s;ive an&s;wer, in&s;i&s;ted upon their engaging &s;imply, without qualification and re&s;erve, to obey the laws of the realm; and they per&s;i&s;ting in their refu&s;al, he went away in the evening, fired with indignation. Though Becket had re&s;igned the office of chancellor, as incon&s;i&s;tent with his &s;acerdotal function, he &s;till retained the honours and ca&s;tles with which he had been intru&s;ted while he filled that &s;tation; and now that the king plainly perceived his intention was to rai&s;e the eccle&s;ia&s;tical power on the ruins of the royal authority, he deemed it highly imprudent to leave tho&s;e places of &s;trength in the hands of &s;uch an ambitious prelate, to who&s;e vio|lence of temper and affected popularity he was no &s;tranger: he therefore de|manded the re&s;titution of the ca&s;tles; and, they being &s;urrendered, quitted Lon|don without taking the lea&s;t notice of the a&s;&s;embly. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron.

Mean while the king, apprehen&s;ive of his e&s;caping to the continent, immediately commenced a &s;uit again&s;t him, on an appeal of a nobleman called John Mare&s;chal, who had &s;ued in the arch|bi&s;hop's court, for an e&s;tate at Mundeham, belonging to the &s;ee of Canterbu|ry; and being, as he apprehended, unju&s;tly ca&s;t, evoked the cau&s;e by a writ of appeal into the king's court. The archbi&s;hop was &s;ummoned to appear, but

in&s;tead of coming in per&s;on he &s;ent four of his knights with a letter of excu&s;e, pretending &s;ickne&s;s; and a certificate from the &s;heriff, &s;pecifying the defects in John's title and appeal.

<P>Be&s;ides this conviction, the king exhibited another charge again&s;t him, for having embezzled three hundred pounds he had received of the ho|nours of Eye and Berckham&s;tede. In an&s;wer to which impeachment, he alledged that he had laid out a greater &s;um in the repairs of the royal ca&s;tles; and wanted to wave the pro&s;ecution, becau&s;e he was not cited to the council on that account: but, the king denying his fir&s;t allegation, and demanding immediate judgment, he agreed to refund the money, and gave &s;ecurity for the payment. Next day an|other &s;uit was commenced again&s;t him at the in&s;tance of the king, for the &s;um of one thou&s;and marks, which he had borrowed of his maje&s;ty; and he was at the &s;ame time required to give an account of the revenues of the archbi&s;hopric, and all the &s;ees and abbeys which had fallen vacant, and been managed by him while he filled the po&s;t of chancellor. He ob&s;erved, as before, that as he had not been &s;ummoned on this account, he did not come prepared for &s;uch a reckoning; but that he would give &s;atisfaction on that &s;ubject at a proper time and place. This an&s;wer was not deemed &s;atisfactory; and the king in&s;i&s;ted upon his finding &s;e|curity to refund the &s;ums he &s;hould be found guilty of having appropriated to his own u&s;e. As he was accu&s;ed of having embezzled two hundred and thirty thou&s;and marks, he could find no-body in court that would undertake for the payment; but, in order to gain time, he de&s;ired leave to con&s;ult his &s;uffragans and clergy.</P>

<P>This reque&s;t being granted, he a&s;&s;embled the prelates at his own hou&s;e, and con&s;ulting them upon the emergency of his affairs, was advi&s;ed by the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter to make a compo&s;ition with the king for a large &s;um of money, with which he would &s;upply him for the purpo&s;e. Two thou&s;and marks were offered and refu&s;ed: then their con&s;ultation being renewed, the more moderate bi&s;hops propo&s;ed that he &s;hould re&s;ign his archbi&s;hopric, and implore the king's mercy; but others exhorted him to &s;hield him&s;elf with the eccle&s;ia&s;tical privi|leges, and plead that his being elected archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, di&s;charged him from all civil actions he might have incurred before his elevation, and all the debts he had contracted as chancellor. This &s;trange plea he adopted, as the mo&s;t flattering and conformable to his own violent and haughty di&s;po&s;ition: but the con&s;ultation was opened again next day, which being Sunday he did not &s;tir abroad; and on Monday he complained of the cholic, by which he was

hindered from appearing in court. This being the ca&s;e, Henry &s;ent all the earls to vi&s;it him, and he promi&s;ed to make his defence on the morrow in a judicial manner. He had by this time re&s;olved to plead his eccle&s;ia&s;tical privilege, becau&s;e indeed it was not in his power to account for the trea&s;ure he had em|bezzled; and with a view to intere&s;t the people in his behalf, he attempted to fa&s;cinate their eyes and judgments with the trompery of pomp and o&s;tentation. He in the morning celebrated the divine &s;ervice appointed for the fe&s;tival of St. Stephen the martyr, beginning with "Princes &s;at and &s;pake again&s;t me." He officiated in his pall, to render the ceremony more &s;triking, and propo&s;ed to walk barefoot to court in his pontificals, carrying the cro&s;s of Canterbury, as if the church had been threatened with a per&s;ecution: but, being diverted from this extravagant de&s;ign by the remon&s;trances of the clergy, he laid a&s;ide his pall and mitre; and mounting a-hor&s;eback in his ve&s;tments, proceeded to the king's court, with the cro&s;s carried before him. Alighting at the ca&s;tle-court, he took the cro&s;s in his own hand, and advanced into the king's chamber, where he &s;at down, holding up the &s;acred implement as a banner, to the amazement of all the &s;pectators, and the unutterable &s;hame of the bi&s;hops, one of whom told him that he &s;eemed to come prepared to &s;et the whole nation in a flame.</P>

<P>The king, who &s;at in an inner room, ordered by proclamation the prelates and nobility to attend him, and complained loudly of Becket's in|tolerable in&s;olence in entering his court in &s;uch a pre&s;umptuous manner, as if he came to bid him defiance. The whole council joined in condemning this in|&s;tance of his pride as an unpardonable in&s;ult upon his maje&s;ty: the prelates gave the king to under&s;tand, that Becket had in the morning reproached them with having concurred in the &s;entence by which his goods and chattels were forfeited; that he had appealed to the pope again&s;t the &s;entence; and inhibited them, by virtue of the papal authority, from &s;itting in judgment upon him for the future, in any part of his conduct previous to his primacy. The king was extremely provoked at this appeal in a civil cau&s;e, which &s;truck at the very ba&s;is of his regal authority; and ordered his barons to enquire of the arch|bi&s;hop him&s;elf, whether or not he had actually made an appeal &s;o contrary to the oath of fealty he had taken at Clarendon. Becket replied, that a &s;acerdotal oath always implied a re&s;ervation of obedience to God, his own eccle&s;ia&s;tical dig|nity, and the epi&s;copal honour of his per&s;on; that, as he had been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed freely from his &s;ecular charge, and promoted to the &s;ee of Canterbury, he was not obliged to give account of any previous tran&s;action; that he had no &s;ecurity to offer; that he had laid an inhibition on the bi&s;hops for his own &s;afety; and that he had appealed and did again appeal to the pope, putting his own per&s;on and the church of Canterbury under the protection of his holine&s;s. The king, being made acquainted with this in&s;olent an&s;wer, conjured the bi&s;hops by their homage and fealty to deliberate with the barons upon the &s;entence that &s;hould be pronounced again&s;t &s;uch a contumacious offender; but, they begged leave to acquie&s;ce in the inhibition, as they knew the violence of Becket, and &s;aw him prepared with his cro&s;s to denounce again&s;t them the &s;entence of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion or excommunication. Henry, in con&s;equence of the dangerous predicament in which they &s;tood, con&s;ented to their &s;itting and deliberating apart from the ba|rons; and when they had maturely con&s;idered the ca&s;e, they &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the archbi&s;hop, complaining of his having laid them under the nece&s;&s;ity of con|travening
<PB N="316" REF="3250">
the con&s;titutions of Clarendon; by one of which they were expre&s;ly bound to fit in judgment with the king's barons: they reminded him of his having been the fir&s;t who &s;wore to tho&s;e con&s;titutions; and appealed to the pope for the redre&s;s of the grievance to which he had &s;ubjected them by his unju&s;t prohibition, which, neverthele&s;s, they would for the pre&s;ent ob|&s;erve. He told them in an&s;wer, he would plead again&s;t their appeal at the court of Rome; that neither he nor they were bound by the con&s;titutions of Clarendon, becau&s;e their o$th implied a &s;alvo for their eccle&s;ia&s;tical dignities; and tho&s;e con&s;titutions had been condemned by the pope, who&s;e example they ought implicitly to follow.</P>

<P>Mean while the king ordered the earls and barons, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;ome high &s;heriffs of counties, to give judgment again&s;t Thomas Becket, arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury, who was declared guilty of perjury and trea&s;on. Then the earl of Leice&s;ter, one of the ju&s;ticiaries of the kingdom, advancing to Bec|ket, at the head of the earls and barons, told him, it was the king's plea&s;ure that he &s;hould either come before his maje&s;ty's court, and acquit him&s;elf of the crimes laid to his charge, or &s;ubmit to his &s;entence, which he was ready to pro|nounce. The archbi&s;hop &s;tarting up, &s;aid, when he was promoted to the &s;ee of Canterbury, he conceived him&s;elf freed from all engagements to the court; and therefore would not an&s;wer to any charge that related to his former conduct: that he being their father, they ought not to judge their parent, nor would he hear their &s;entence; ina&s;much as he had di&s;owned all courts of judicature but that of the pope, to whom he appealed, and under who&s;e protection he would now retire. So &s;aying, he walked with his cro&s;s to the door, which was imme|diately opened at his de&s;ire, but in pa&s;&s;ing through the ca&s;tle-yard, he was hooted along as a perjured wretch and a traitor, and retorted the&s;e reproaches with great virulence upon &s;ome per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, whom he branded with the epithets of liars and &s;ecundrels. He called earl Hammelin, the king's natural-brother, an impudent ba&s;tard, and reminded another nobleman of his kin&s;man's being hanged for felony.</P>

Nor did Henry's emba&s;&s;y &s;ucceed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Epi&s;t. S.

<P>Becket acquired &s;uch favour and influence with the pope, that he ventured to tell him in confidence, he had not been canonically elected, but in|truded into the &s;ee by the regal authority; he therefore made a formal re&s;ignation to his holine&s;s, who in con&s;ideration of his extraordinary merit and &s;ufferings on account of his attachment to the papal power, re&s;tored him to his archbi&s;hopric, and till &s;uch time as he could recover po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, recommended him to the abbot of Pontigny, where he was entertained at the expence of the mona&s;tery: but, he had &s;carce taken up his re&s;idence in this retreat, when reflecting that almo&s;t all his pre|dece&s;&s;ors had been monks, he was &s;eized with the de&s;ire of taking the habit, and wrote on this &s;ubject to the pope, from whom he received it, hallowed by the pa|pal benediction.

<P>Henry could not be too cautious in taking &s;teps to anticipate the re&s;entment of Becket, who&s;e violence of temper was hardly re&s;trained from the mo&s;t rancorous mea&s;ures of revenge by the authority of Alexander, who dreaded that if matters &s;hould be brought to extremity again&s;t the king or king|dom of England, Henry would join his new ally the emperor of Germany, who patronized Guy de Crema the antipope; and he was not yet &s;o firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed in the papal chair, as to &s;et &s;uch a conjunction at defiance. Influenced by the&s;e con&s;iderations, he &s;trongly recommended temperance to the archbi&s;hop, who was not without great difficulty and addre&s;s witheld from proceeding to the ex|tremity of church cen&s;ure. He rai&s;ed a terrible clamour in all places by his let|ters

and emi&s;&s;aries, a&s;&s;erting that his cau&s;e was the cau&s;e of God; and that Chri&s;t was judged in his per&s;on before a lay tribunal, and crucified again in his &s;$fferings. He wrote in&s;olent letters to the king him&s;elf, affirming that he derived all his power from the church; that prie&s;ts were exempted from human laws; and that the &s;ecular being &s;ubject to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical power, Henry ought to part with the ancient cu&s;toms and regalities of his crown. He obtained a grant of the primacy of all England from the pope, who writ in his favour to the Engli&s;h bi&s;hops, ordering them to procure a re&s;titution of all the benefices belonging to Becket's clergy, on pain of excommunication, without benefit of appeal. Alexan|der's affairs were no &s;ooner in a pro&s;perous condition, than he allowed the arch|bi&s;hop to follow the mo&s;t extravagant dictates of his re&s;entment. Accordingly that &s;urious prelate repaired to Soi&s;&s;ons, watched all night at the &s;hrine of St. Drau&s;ius, a ceremony which was &s;uppo&s;ed to render the probationer invincible; and thence hied him to Vezelai, re&s;olved to thunder out a &s;entence of excommuni|cation again&s;t the king of England and his mini&s;ters. Hearing, however, that Henry was dangerou&s;ly ill, he contented him&s;elf with &s;ending a letter to that monarch, threatening him with the cen&s;ures of the church, if he would not im|mediately repent and make reparation to the clergy whom he had injured; at the &s;ame time he denounced excommunication again&s;t the mini&s;ters by name; all that were concerned in &s;eque&s;tring the revenues of the &s;ee of Canterbury; that obeyed, favoured, or executed the con&s;titutions of Charendon, which he annulled; and he ab&s;olved all the prelates and barons from the oath they had<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vit.

Notwith&s;tanding the pains that were taken to guard the ports of England, the bi&s;hop of London, while he was at the high altar celebrating the fe&s;tival of St. Paul, received from an unknown hand a packet, containing authentic copies of Becket's letters, and a bull of legation granted to him by the pope, which he ordered the bi&s;hop to notify to all the prelates of the realm, with injunctions to re-e&s;tabli&s;h all his clergy in their benefices, within two months, on pain of excommunication, without benefit of appeal. This mandate, confirmed by the pope's authority, laid the bi&s;hop under great difficulties, becau&s;e by refu&s;ing to execute the order, he &s;hould incur the cen&s;ure of di&s;obedience: but he was &s;oon rid of his fears by the &s;ucce&s;s of John de Oxford and the other agents, who had been &s;ent to make the pope acquainted with the appeal of the Eng|li&s;h bi&s;hops and clergy, and beg the protection of his holine&s;s.

She was convinced of her &s;on's equitable intentions in his di&s;pute with the archbi&s;hop; &s;he ju&s;tified his zeal for the cu&s;toms and prerogatives of the crown; but &s;he di&s;approved of the written con&s;titutions, which &s;he imagined might have been omitted without any preju|dice to the regal authority.</P>

<P>The&s;e her &s;entiments, in all probability, induced the pope and Becket to &s;ollicit her mediation, which &s;he had promi&s;ed to employ; but this being an|ticipated by her death, the di&s;pute was left to the addre&s;s of William de Pavia, and Otho, the two legates a latere, &s;ent by the pope with full power to negoci|ate an accommodation. At lea&s;t when they departed from Rome, they were in|ve&s;ted with &s;uch power; but, in con&s;equence of Becket's complaints, importing that they were attached to the king, and that he would not adhere to their deci|&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

After a tedious journey they arrived at Caen in Normandy, where they found the king, with a good number of his prelates, in full hope of &s;eeing the di&s;pute terminated by a &s;entence that would confirm the con&s;titutions of Cla|rendon: but Henry was not a little chagrined, when they gave him to under|&s;tand that the archbi&s;hop was exempted from their deci&s;ion. Neverthele&s;s, as the pope had in a letter exhorted Becket to make hearty advances towards a peace, the legates met him at Planches, between Gi&s;ors and Trie, where they a&s;&s;ured him of the king's pacific di&s;po&s;ition, advi&s;ed him to make his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and de&s;ired to know upon what terms he was willing to treat: they propo&s;ed, that in order to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the peace of the church, he &s;hould re&s;ign his &s;ee, pro|vided the king would give up the con&s;titutions: but he rejected the expedient, renounced their arbitration, and declared he would enter into no treaty of accom|modation, until he and his clergy &s;hould be re&s;tored. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fitz Stephens Vit.

<P>The legates were equally un&s;ucce&s;sful in executing the other part of their commi&s;&s;ion, which related to a peace between the crowns of France and England, which in order to promote they &s;et out for Paris, where their pro|po&s;al met with in&s;urmountable difficulties. The barons of Poitou and Guienne, being di&s;gu&s;ted at Henry, who had invaded &s;ome of their privileges, li&s;tened to the &s;ugge&s;tions of Lewis, who inflamed their di&s;content, and encouraged them to revolt with promi&s;e of a&s;&s;i&s;tance. A good number of them having engaged in a private treaty with that monarch, and even given ho&s;tages that they would not lay down their arms without his con&s;ent, broke out in open rebellion and ravaged the country; though the truce between the two crowns was not yet ex|pired. Henry, putting him&s;elf at the head of his forces, marched again&s;t the rebels, took their ca&s;tles, de&s;troyed their towns, and reduced them to &s;uch a low condition, that nothing hindered their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, but their engagement to the king of France. In order to remove this ob&s;tacle, Henry having garri&s;oned the ca&s;tles, and committed the government of the country to his queen and Patrick<NOTE PLACE="marg">An$ Ch. 1168.</NOTE> D'Evereux, earl of Sali&s;bury, went to hold a conference with Lewis between Mante and Pacey, in hope of e&s;tabli&s;hing a peace, or at lea&s;t of renewing the truce, which was well nigh expired. At this congre&s;s he loudly complained of the French king's having debauched his &s;ubjects, and in&s;i&s;ted upon his re|&s;toring the ho&s;tages of the Poitivins: but, Lewis peremptorily refu&s;ed to comply with this demand, and all that he could obtain was a further ce&s;&s;ation from ho&s;tilities. In the mean time the barons of Poitou had again revolted, and &s;lain the earl of Sali&s;bury in a treacherous manner; and Henry had ju&s;t begun his march towards that country, with a view to take vengeance on Guy de Lu&s;ignan and the other accomplices in that murder, when he was obliged to &s;u&s;pend his indignation, and turn his arms again&s;t the barons of Brittany,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr. Trevel. Rob. de Mo$te.</NOTE> who had refu&s;ed to obey, when they were &s;ummoned to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Eudo, vi&s;count of Porhoet, a nobleman of an ambitious and turbulent di&s;po&s;ition, who claimed the government of the whole province, had been expelled by Hen|ry, and took refuge in the French court, where he was encouraged to form a con&s;piracy again&s;t the government of the king of England. He accordingly prevailed upon &s;everal lords of Brittany to engage in the de&s;ign. A treaty was con|cluded with France, and ho&s;tages were given, as in the ca&s;e of Poitou; &s;o that a univer&s;al rebellion en&s;ued. Henry no &s;ooner received information of this revolt, than he entered Brittany with his forces, took and demoli&s;hed Eudo's fortre&s;&s;es, reduced and ravaged all the country of Porhoet, Dinan, and St. Malo; pro|ceeding with great rapidity of conque&s;t, until he was obliged to give the king of France a meeting at La Ferte Bernard, where he hoped to renew the truce, if a &s;olid peace could not be effected. But, as the French knew the nobility of Le Maine were ripe for an in&s;urrection, to which they had been in&s;tigated by the Bretons, this interview proved ineffectual, and the war was renewed.</P>

<P>Henry finding him&s;elf expo&s;ed to the efforts of &s;o many enemies, re|&s;olved to gain over one of the mo&s;t trouble&s;ome, namely, Matthew, count of Boulogne, who having claimed the county of Mortagne, and met with a refu&s;al, had, in the cour&s;e of the preceding year, equipped an armament of &s;ix hun|dred ve&s;&s;els, for an inva&s;ion of England; though he was baffled in his attempt by the vigilance and conduct of Richard de Luce, chief ju&s;ticiary and guardian of the realm. This difference Henry thought proper to compromi&s;e, by allow|ing him a very con&s;iderable pen&s;ion, in con&s;equence of which he engaged to reinforce the king with a body of auxiliary knights. Being denied a pa&s;&s;age by land through the territories of John, count of Ponthieu, he was obliged to tran&s;port his troops by &s;ea; and Henry, re&s;enting the refu&s;al, entered John's do|minions, ravaged the country, and reduced above forty towns to a&s;hes. Mean while the king of France making a &s;udden incur&s;ion into Normandy, retorted the&s;e deva&s;tations; but, as Henry advanced again&s;t him, he retired, though not &s;o &s;peedily but that the king of England fell upon his rear, and took a good number of pri&s;oners. The war was carried on in &s;light incur&s;ions and &s;kir|mi&s;hes; for though the two kings commanded their re&s;pective armies in per&s;on, and were equally famed for courage and military &s;kill, they indu&s;triou&s;ly avoid|ed a general engagement. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Epi&s;t.

<P>The emperor and princes of Germany offered to make a diver&s;ion in favour of Henry, by invading France with a powerful army; but, as they ex|pected he would declare for the antipope Pa&s;chal, in con&s;ideration of the&s;e &s;uc|cours; he cho&s;e to confide in his own &s;trength, rather than run the ri&s;que of embroiling his dominions &s;till farther, by incurring the re&s;entment of Alexander, with whom he &s;till kept mea&s;ures, and from whom he had obtained a di&s;pen|&s;ation for the marriage of his &s;on Geoffrey with Con&s;tance, heire&s;s of Bretagne. Though the emperor and Henry differed in opinion or politics with regard to the pope, that difference did not retard the celebration of the marriage between his daughter Maud and the duke of Saxony. Queen Eleanor repaired to England, in order to make preparations for the departure of that prince&s;s, who was &s;ent into Germany with a prodigious &s;um, levied for her portion by a general tax,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr.

The earne&s;t &s;ollicitations of Lewis, and the importunities of Becket, at length prevail|ed upon pope Alexander to allow this rancorous prelate to denounce his cen&s;ures again&s;t the king and realm of England; and a day was appointed for excommuni|cating Henry, and laying the nation under an interdict, if, in the mean time, the king &s;hould refu&s;e to re&s;tore the archbi&s;hop and his clergy. Becket, accord|ing to this bull of permi&s;&s;ion, when the time arrived, fulminated a &s;entence of excommunication again&s;t &s;ome of the king's mini&s;ters, notwith&s;tanding the &s;e|cond appeal, and without form of law or citations; and Ralf, archdeacon of Landaff, was &s;ent to Rome to procure ab&s;olution for the per&s;ons thus cen|&s;ured. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Vit.

<P>About this period two nuncios from the pope arrived at Danfront in Normandy$ where they pre&s;ented letters from his holine&s;s to the king, pre&s;&s;ing him to re&s;tore Becket, and referring him to the bearers for a further explanation of his de&s;ires. Henry, having conferred with the&s;e repre&s;entatives, a&s;&s;embled his pre|lates at Bayeux, where he declared that out of regard to the pope, he would be reconciled to Becket and his clergy; but, in return for this conde&s;cen&s;ion, he
<PB N="324" REF="3330">
expected that the nuncios would ab&s;olve his mini&s;ters that were then pre&s;ent, and even cro&s;s the &s;ea to give ab&s;olution to tho&s;e that remained in England. Af|ter &s;ome di&s;pute they were prevailed upon to comply, on condition that the re|conciliation &s;hould take place within a certain limited time; and in this agree|ment, which was committed to writing, the king in&s;erted a &s;alvo for the dignity of his kingdom. The archbi&s;hop's partizans took exceptions to this clau&s;e, and the nuncios de&s;ired it might be expunged, otherwi&s;e they retracted their promi&s;e. Routrou, archbi&s;hop of Rouen, propo&s;ed, that another &s;hould be &s;ub&s;tituted in its place, importing, that Becket &s;hould be re&s;tored to his &s;ee, and the clergy retrieve their benefices in as full a manner, as that in which they had enjoyed them before their privation; and Henry agreed to this amendment, provided his &s;alvo &s;hould remain. Becket's friends in&s;i&s;ted upon its being removed, and the nuncio's finding both parties inflexible, departed without having &s;ucceeded in their negociation. The prelates wrote to the pope in favour of the clau&s;e, in de|fence of which the king &s;ent Reginald de Sali&s;bury and Richard Barre to the court of Rome, with orders to demand that the pope would ab&s;olve tho&s;e whom Becket had excommunicated, and prevent &s;uch cen&s;ures for the future, otherwi&s;e he &s;hould be obliged to provide for his own honour and &s;ecurity in an|oth$$<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr.

<P>Mean while &s;uppo&s;ing that the in&s;tances of the French court were the chief ob&s;tacles that retarded an accommodation with Alexander, he exerted all his endeavours to &s;ubdue the revolted barons, from who&s;e in&s;urrection Lewis hoped to derive great advantages, and their confederacy being altogether di&s;|&s;olved by Henry's activity, and the departure of Guy de Lu&s;ignan for Jeru&s;a|lem, of which he was created monarch, the king of France became more tractable, and in a conference at Montmirail, the two monarchs adju&s;ted all their diffe|rences. Henry had by this $ime made over Normandy, Le Maine, and Anjou, to his elde&s;t &s;on Henry; Poitou and Guienne, to his &s;on Richard; and Bre|tagne, to Geoffrey; who held it as a fief depending upon Normandy, and &s;wore fealty to his elder brother. Lewis, as &s;overeign of all the&s;e fiefs, confirmed this di&s;po&s;ition, and young Henry did homage to his father-in-law, and his young &s;on Philip Augu&s;tus, for Anjou, Maine, and Bretagne, having taken the oaths for Normandy on a former occa&s;ion. Richard, contracted to Adelais, another prince&s;s of France, did homage for Guienne; Henry him&s;elf was re&s;tored to the office of high$&s;teward, which had been hereditary in the counts of Anjou; and on Candlemas-day &s;erved the king of France at table in that capacity. As the king of England was not re&s;trained by any article of this treaty, from cha&s;ti&s;ing the revolted barons of Poitou and Guienne, he marched into tho&s;e counties, de&s;troyed their ca&s;tles, and reduced to obedience the counts of Ango$le&s;me and La Marche, together with all the le&s;&s;er nobility of tho&s;e pro|vinces. Then returning to Normandy, he built the &s;trong fortre&s;s of Beauvoir en lions: drew broad and deep trenches on the frontiers of his Norman domi|nions, to prevent the depredations of his neighbours; erected fi&s;heries in the ri|ver Mayenne; and ordered high banks to be rai&s;ed along the north-&s;ide of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> Loire, to keep that river within its channel.</P>

upon to avoid mentioning the con&s;titutions of Clarendon, as they were already condemned by the pope. The prelates had well nigh per&s;uaded him to throw him&s;elf at the king's feet, and refer the terms of reconciliation to his royal plea|&s;ure; but when he was introduced for this purpo&s;e, he clogged his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion with his old &s;alvo of the honour of God and the liberty of the church; and Henry was &s;o incen&s;ed at this re&s;ervation, that he told him he would allow of no &s;uch eva&s;ive &s;ubterfuge. Then turning to the king of France, he inveighed &s;everly again&s;t his pride, arrogance, and ambition; and to vindicate him&s;elf from the a&s;per&s;ions which the other had thrown upon his character, offered, in the hearing of all the &s;pectators, to re&s;tore him to the &s;ee of Canterbury, which he &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s with all the privilege and authority, that was ever ve&s;ted in the greate&s;t prelate that ever enjoyed that archbi&s;hopric, provided he would pro|mi&s;e to pay to Henry &s;uch regard as the mo&s;t powerful prelate had at any<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

The king of France, together with his prelates and nobility, could not help applauding the can|dour of this propo&s;al, which they exhorted Becket to embrace. But he refu&s;ed to part with a tittle of his &s;alvo; and &s;everal French noblemen made no &s;cruple of condemning his pride publicly, and exclaiming, that &s;ince he rejected &s;uch rea&s;onable terms, he de&s;erved no protection, and ought not to be &s;uffered to live within the dominions either of England or of France. The two kings parted at night, without taking the lea&s;t notice of the archbi&s;hop; and Lewis for &s;ome days neglected to vi&s;it or &s;upply him with provi&s;ions: but this &s;eems to have been a di&s;&s;embled di&s;gu&s;t; for he &s;oon readmitted him into his former place of friend&s;hip and familiarity.

<P>Alexander acted the more moderately on this occa&s;ion, as he perceived the interdict had produced very little effect in England, and the &s;entences of ex|communication were utterly di&s;regarded: he knew Henry to be a prince of great authority and re&s;olution, beloved by his &s;ubjects, and tenacious of his preroga|tive; and he began to fear that &s;hould matters come to extremity, the &s;ee of Rome might lo&s;e all the power and influence &s;he had acquired in England. He, on the&s;e con&s;iderations, made fre&s;h efforts towards a reconciliation of the king with the archbi&s;hop, and employed the bi&s;hop of Bellay and the prior of the Carthu&s;ians to per&s;uade Henry to a re&s;titution; but all their endeavours prov|ing ineffectual, he &s;ent a commi&s;&s;ion to Simeon, prior of Montdieu, and Ber|nard de Corilo, of the order of Grandmont, to labour at an accommodation; and they were furni&s;hed with two letters to the king, to be u&s;ed occa&s;ionally.

In the&s;e &s;entiments he pretended to make a kind of pilgrimage to St. Denis, hoping he &s;hould find an opportunity to broach his propo&s;al in an interview with the king of France, at Montmartre, in the neighbourhood of Paris. According to his expectation, in conver&s;ing with that prince and his prelates, the di&s;cour&s;e turning upon the liberties of the church, as not at all incompatible with the royal au|thority, the bi&s;hops interceded for the re&s;toration of Becket, to which Henry ex|pre&s;&s;ed no aver&s;ion. That this favourable di&s;po&s;ition might not be lo&s;t, they prevailed upon the archbi&s;hop, who was in an adjoining apartment, to prefer a petition, &s;pecifying all his demands, touching the re&s;toration of him&s;elf and his clergy; and as &s;ome di&s;putes aro&s;e, touching the vacant benefices which had been filled in his ab&s;ence, the king offered to pre&s;ent him with a thou&s;and marks to defray the expence of his return, and &s;ubmit the cau&s;e to the determination of the French peers, the Gallican church, or the univer&s;ity of Paris. Lewis and all the nobility, French as well as Engli&s;h applauded the propo&s;al; and Becket con&s;ented to wave his other demands, provided the king would grant &s;ecurity for the performance of the agreement. When they expo&s;tulated with him upon the indecency of requiring &s;ecurity from his lord and &s;overeign; he &s;aid, he would be &s;atisfied with a ki&s;s of peace: with which, however, the king refu&s;ed to indulge him, alledging he had &s;worn in his wrath, that he would never ki&s;s the archbi&s;hop, even though a reconciliation &s;hould be effected.</P>

<P>This refu&s;al, which looked a little &s;u&s;picious to Lewis and the media|tors, being reported to Becket, he rejected peace upon any other terms, and &s;eemed to feel a &s;ecret plea&s;ure in thinking he &s;hould by his ob&s;tinacy oblige Henry to comply at la&s;t, and own him&s;elf perjured in the pre&s;ence of &s;uch an augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly; for he concluded, that the king found a reconciliation indi&s;|pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to the intere&s;t of his affairs.

Lewis without having made any other propo&s;ition. He did not fail, however, to di&s;patch John of Oxford, dean of Sali&s;bury, and the archbi&s;hops of Rouen and Seez, on an emba&s;&s;y to the pope, with an account of what had pa&s;&s;ed at the conference, and an a&s;&s;urance of his readine&s;s to re&s;tore the archbi&s;hop; nay, in order to remove the only remaining objection, he propo&s;ed, that his elde&s;t &s;on &s;hould, in his &s;tead, give the ki&s;s of peace, which Becket &s;o eagerly de&s;ired; Alexander approved of the expedient, and, in order to take the advantage of this happy di&s;po&s;ition in Henry, he forthwith &s;ent a commi&s;&s;ion, empowering Routrou, archbi&s;hop of Rouen, and Bernard, bi&s;hop of Nevers, to execute the treaty. They were in&s;tructed to admoni&s;h Henry to grant the ki&s;s of peace to Becket, as the pope ab&s;olved him of the ra&s;h oath he had made; but, &s;hould he &s;till decline that conde&s;cen&s;ion, they were directed to per&s;uade the archbi&s;hop<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ar.

To redre&s;s the&s;e grievances, Henry convoked a great council at Wind&s;or, in which the kingdom was divided into circuits, and commi&s;&s;ioners were appointed to make a progre&s;s through the&s;e divi&s;ions, and take &s;ecurity from all &s;heriffs, their bailifis, and other officers, that they would appear at an appointed day before the king, and give an account of their management.

<P>The day on which the&s;e delinquents were puni&s;hed, was di&s;tingui&s;hed by another great &s;olemnity. William, king of Scotland, and his brother Da|vid, had been at court for &s;ome time, and all the nobility and prelates were &s;um|moned to meet at London, and a&s;&s;$&s;t at the coronation of prince Henry, now in the &s;ixteenth year of his age. He came over from Normandy for this pur|po&s;e, and was crowned in the church of We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey, in the mid&s;t of a more numerous a&s;&s;embly than had ever appeared on the like occa&s;ion. After the ceremony the Scotti&s;h king and his brother did homage to the young king, and all pre&s;ent &s;wore fealty to him, &s;aving that which was due to their lord the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bened$cti a$nas.</NOTE> king his father. Roger, archbi&s;hop of York, who was likewi&s;e legate for Scot|land, officiated in crowning this young prince, who was of a proud in&s;olent di&s;po&s;i|tion, of which he could not help exhibiting marks at the banquet that &s;ucceeded the &s;olemnity.

&s;on, that he might now boa&s;t of being &s;erved as honourably as any monarch upon earth. Young Henry, in&s;tead of making a proper reply to this compli|ment, turned towards the archbi&s;hop of York, and, in a low voice, ob&s;erved, that there was nothing &s;trange in &s;eeing a great king's heir &s;erved by the &s;on of a petty count.</P>

<P>The king &s;eems to have been very careful in keeping his de&s;ign &s;ecret, till the very day of execution; as if he had been apprehen&s;ive of &s;ome oppo&s;ition; for the nobility and prelates imagined they were a&s;&s;embled for no other purpo&s;e, than that of trying the &s;heriffs; and the young prince was igno|rant of his father's intention, until he arrived in England, two days before the coronation. Not but that a general report prevailed, of the king's having formed &s;uch a &s;cheme, though it was not &s;uppo&s;ed he had fixed any time for the execution of it: Becket had writ to the archbi&s;hop of York, and the other Engli&s;h prelates, forbidding them to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the coronation, and the pope$ at his de&s;ire, had confirmed the inhibition. Some of the&s;e mandates were actually brought over into England; but &s;uch was the &s;everity of the law, that no per&s;on would deliver them according to the direction. Becket, under&s;tand|ing they had mi&s;carried, &s;ent an order to the convent of Chri&s;t-church, to i&s;&s;ue out, by virtue of the papal authority, the like inhibition upon all the &s;uffra|grans of the church of Canterbury; to enter a prote&s;t in favour of its rights, and make an appeal for prevention of the intended injury: but this order was utterly di&s;regarded. Then Becket &s;ent his own inhibitions, confirmed by the pope, to Roger, bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, at that time re&s;iding in Normandy, who undertook to deliver them, and had reached Dieppe in his way to England, when the queen and Richard du Hommet, ju&s;ticiary of the Norman dominions, &s;u&s;pecting his de&s;ign, on account of his attachment to Becket, &s;ent an order for|bidding him to embark, and laid an embargo upon all the &s;hipping in the har|bour. The archbi&s;hop, baffled in all his &s;chemes, had recour&s;e to the king of France, who re&s;olved to &s;end a caveat to queen Eleanor, again&s;t the corona|tion of prince Henry, unle&s;s his daughter &s;hould be crowned at the &s;ame time; otherwi&s;e he would immediately declare war again&s;t England. But this project could not be executed in time to prevent the ceremony. Becket was extreme|ly mortified, when he found it impracticable to hinder this coronation, which he hoped would never take place until the prince &s;hould fir&s;t &s;wear, that he would maintain the liberties of the &s;ee of Canterbury, and rever&s;e the con&s;titu|tioons of Clarendon; and, in the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of his wrath, he wrote a letter to pope Alexander, affirming, that the young king had not only omitted the u&s;ual oath for pre&s;erving the liberties of the church; but even &s;wore that he would maintain the con&s;titions of Clarendon. The pope was &s;o incen&s;ed at this repre&s;en|tation, that he forthwith &s;upplied Becket with &s;entences of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion and excom|munication again&s;t all the Engli&s;h prelates who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the &s;olemnity: but the pope was undeceived by Gilles, bi&s;hop of Evreux, who attended at the coro|nation, and atte&s;ted that Henry had taken an oath in favour of the church; and that the con&s;titutions were not once mentioned on the occa&s;ion. The letters of &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion were qualified accordingly, and though granted again&s;t the archbi&s;hop of York, and the bi&s;hops of London and Sali&s;bury, never took effect in England. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ep.

<P>Mean while the pope's commi&s;&s;ion was delivered to Routrou and the bi&s;hop of Nevers, who had come to Caen in order to tran&s;act that accommo|dation; and the term was prolonged on account of Henry's ab&s;ence. That

prince had no &s;ooner &s;ettled the affairs of his kingdom, than he cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea, and in a conference at La Fert&eacute; in the Pais Chartrain, compromi&s;ed his dif|ference with the king of France, who had expre&s;&s;ed great re&s;entment, and even denounced war again&s;t him for the affront put upon his daughter, in omitting her coronation when her hu&s;band received the crown. The king of England made proper &s;atisfaction for this &s;uppo&s;ed in&s;ult; and while the princes were employed in e&s;tab$i&s;hing a &s;olid peace between the two crowns, the legates vi&s;ited B$cket at Sens, and prevailed upon him to wave the ki&s;s, and the $e&s;titution of the mean profits of his &s;ee, and accompany them to the conference. The ceremo|nial of the interview being regulated, Lewis ab&s;ented him&s;elf, that Henry's ge|nero&s;ity might appear more free and uncon&s;trained; though count Theobald and the greate&s;t part of the French nobility were pre&s;ent at this extraordinary reconciliation. When Becket approached, the king advanced to meet him in the mo&s;t gracious manner; and notwith&s;tanding the ran$our and violence with which that prelate had per&s;ecuted him &s;o long, he, to the amazement of all the &s;pe$ta|tors, talked to the archbi&s;hop with great ea&s;e, familiarity, and &s;eeming kindne&s;s, as if they had never been at variance. After the fir&s;t &s;alutation, they conferred with the archbi&s;hop of Sens apart, and then retiring by them&s;elves, pa&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t part of the day in private di&s;cour&s;e. All material points being adju&s;t|ed, Becket attended Henry on hor&s;eback, and, as they rode together, pro|po&s;ed, that the king &s;hould make &s;atisfaction to the church of Canterbury, who&s;e right had been invaded by the archbi&s;hop of York, who had officiated at young Henry's coronation. Though his maje&s;ty was of opinion that he had a right to chu&s;e the prelate who &s;hould perform that ceremony, yet, in order to manife&s;t h$s inclination for peace, he promi&s;ed that the &s;ee of Canter|bury &s;hould have &s;atisfaction: nay, as the queen of young Henry was not yet crowned, he a&s;&s;ured the archbi&s;hop he &s;hould perform that ceremony, at which he might likewi&s;e place the crown on her hu&s;band's head, as a right inherent in the &s;ee of Canterbury. Becket, tran&s;ported at this in&s;tance of the king's con|de&s;cen&s;ion, alighted in&s;tantly, and threw him&s;elf at the feet of his &s;overeign, who, leaping from his hor&s;e at the &s;ame time, lifted him from the ground, and helped him to remount. He, at the &s;ame time, extended his royal grace to the clergy who had attended Becket in his exile; but, when the bi&s;hop of Li&s;ieux propo&s;ed that the archbi&s;hop &s;hould likewi&s;e forgive tho&s;e who adhered to the king, he evad|ed the reque&s;t by fr$volous di&s;tinctions, which might have produced mi&s;chievous con&s;equences, had not Henry, to avoid the revival of animo&s;ity, put an end to the conference, and invited the archbi&s;hop to accompany him directly to Nor|mandy, where he would make &s;uitable provi&s;ion for him and his retinue. This invitation he declined, pretending it would be indecent to part &s;o abruptly with the king of France, and his other benefactors; though the real rea&s;on was a re|&s;olution he had taken to wait in France, until he &s;hould be certified that his agent<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ S.

<P>Henry, at his return from Normandy, was taken ill at La Mote Gar|nier near Danfront, and the di&s;temper gained &s;uch ground, that the phy&s;icians had little hopes of his recovery: he therefore made his wi$l, in which he be|queathed England, Normandy, and Anjou, to his elde&s;t &s;on, with &s;trong in|junctions to provide for his brother John; Guienne to Richard, and Bretagne to his third &s;on Geoffrey. But at length his con&s;titution triumphed over his di&s;ea&s;e; and when his health was re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, he went on a pilgrimage to
<PB N="331" REF="3400">
St. Mary of Roque-Madour in Quercy. As this indi&s;po&s;ition occa&s;ioned a delay in &s;igning the powers nece&s;&s;ary for Becket's agents, that prelate, dreading the &s;incerity of the king, &s;ollicited the pope to denounce his eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ures; and Alexander i&s;&s;ued his bulls accordingly, reviving the former &s;entences of excommunication and interdict again&s;t the kingdom of England, as well as Henry's foreign dominions, to take place if full &s;atisfaction &s;hould not be given to the archbi&s;hop within thirty days after the commonition. The king, in order to avert the&s;e trouble&s;ome cen&s;ures, propo&s;ed another meeting with Becket at Amboi&s;e, where every remaining ob&s;tacle was removed by the mediation of the French king; and the archbi&s;hop agreed to receive the ki&s;s of peace from young Henry. His agents were immediately impowered to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the arch|bi&s;hopric; and his clergy were re&s;tored to their benefices: but, as &s;ix dioce&s;es were vacant, the king re&s;olved to &s;upply them with prelates well affected to his per&s;on and government before the return of Becket, who had formed a &s;cheme to fill tho&s;e vacancies with his own creatures. In order to prevent &s;uch a dan|gerous acce&s;&s;ion of power, in a prie&s;t of his character, Henry ordered the bi|&s;hops of York, London, and Sarum, to repair into Normandy, with &s;ix deputies from each chapter of the vacant &s;ees, that proper per&s;ons might be cho&s;en for &s;uch important offices. Geoffrey Ridel, archdeacon of Canterbury, whom Becket looked upon as h$s bittere&s;t enemy, was promoted to the &s;ee of Ely, though he died before his con&s;ecration; Reginald, &s;on of the bi&s;hop of Sali&s;|bury, was elected in the dioce&s;e of Bath; and the other vacancies were filled with prelates who had no great devotion to the archbi&s;hop.</P>

<P>Another quarrel was kindled between France and England, by Hen|ry's purcha&s;ing of Henry de Vienne, Montmerail, and the ca&s;tle of St. Agnan in Berry, which was an appanage of the dutchy of Guienne. This &s;tep gave great umbrage to Theobald, count de Blois, who had a claim to tho&s;e places; and the king of France &s;upported his preten&s;ions at the head of an army, with which he invaded Auvergne. Henry had advanced with a body of troops to take<NOTE PLACE="marg">R. de Monte.</NOTE> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Bourges; but finding him&s;elf anticipated by the French forces, agreed to a truce with Lewis. While he was employed in this expedition, Bec|ket arrived at Rouen, where he found John of Oxford, dean of Sali&s;bury, ap|pointed to attend him into England. Embarking at Wit&s;and with a favourable wind, he arrived at Sandwich, where, in con&s;equence of the king's order, he was exempted from examination, by Gerva&s;e de Cornhill, high &s;heriff of Kent; and Reginald de Warenne, who, in quality of itinerant ju&s;ticiaries, guarded that port, with a number of armed officers. They treated the archbi&s;hop and his clergy with great re&s;pect, to which Becket was not intitled by his behaviour; for, upon hearing that the king intended to fill the vacancies, he had di&s;patched a per&s;on before him with letters to the archbi&s;hop of York, and the prelates of London and Sarum, to notify the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the fir&s;t, and the excommunica|tion of the other two; cen&s;ures under which they remained a whole year, though in the mean time, they pur&s;ued their voyage to Normandy. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Epi&s;t.

made a progre&s;s through Kent, in all the &s;plendour and magnificence of a &s;o|vereign pontiff, while the towns, through which he pa&s;&s;ed, welcomed him with &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ions and hymns of thank&s;giving. He had brought over three fine hor&s;es, as a pre&s;ent to the young king, who re$ided at Wode&s;toke, for which place he &s;et out in full a&s;&s;urance of a gracious reception. But that prince being informed of this ridiculous parade, calculated to dazzle the eyes of the vulgar, after he had broken the conditions of his reconciliation, violated the laws, and in&s;ulted the royal authority from the fir&s;t hour of his arrival, &s;ent Jocelin de Lovain, brother to the &s;econd queen of Henry I. and ance&s;tor of the Pe$cy fa|mily, to defire he would immediately return to his dioce&s;e. Becket had, by this time, advanced as far as Southwark, attended by all the knights that held of his &s;ee, and a great number of armed followers, to &s;upport his legatine authority, which he exerci&s;ed in &s;u&s;pending or depriving the clergy, and excommunicating the laity who had adhered to the laws of the kingdom in oppo&s;ition to the papal decrees. He did not think proper to di&s;pute the young king's order, which, however, he did not &s;cruple to &s;ay he &s;hould have di&s;obeyed, had it not been for the near approach of Chri&s;tmas, which he de&s;ired to celebrate at his own church in Canterbury: neverthele&s;s, he would not return directly, but in order to ma|nife&s;t his contempt of the royal authority, went to his manor of Harrow in Mid|d$$&s;ex, where he &s;ta$d &s;everal days. In his return to Canterbury, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t part of his retinue, and remained quiet at his own palace till Chri&s;t|mas-day, when, mounting the pulpit, he pronounced a &s;ermon calculated for inflaming the minds of the people again&s;t tho&s;e who had oppo&s;ed his mea&s;ures, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">F$tz$$e$ $ens.

<P>Advice of the&s;e proceedings being brought to Henry, during the fe&s;tival of the nativity, which he kept at Bures near Bayeux, with his prelates and barons, he was &s;o provoked at the unparallelled arrogance of Becket, that he could not help breaking forth into acrimonious expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t that turbu|lent prelate, whom he had rai&s;ed from the dunghill, to be the plague of his life and the continual di&s;turber of his government. He is &s;aid to have declared he &s;hould never enjoy a quiet hour while Becket &s;hould be alive, and lamented that he had no friends about him, otherwi&s;e he &s;hould not have been &s;o long expo&s;ed to the in&s;ults of a babbling prie&s;t. Whether he actually u&s;ed this expre&s;&s;ion in the fir&s;t tran&s;port of his wrath, or his &s;entiments were mi&s;interpreted by his do|me&s;tics, certain it is, four barons or knights of the hou&s;hold, namely William de Tracey, Reginald Fitzu$&s;e, Hugh de Moreville, and Richard Brito, engaged in a mu$ual o$th to revenge the king's quarrel, withdrew from court, took &s;hip|ing at different ports, and met next day at the ca&s;tle of Saltwode, within &s;ix miles of Canterbury. Mean while the king &s;u&s;pecting their de&s;ign, by the privacy of their departure, di&s;patched me&s;&s;engers to overtake, and forbid them, in his name, to commit any violence; but the con&s;pirators had already taken &s;hipping, and the king's orders arrived too late in England, to prevent the execution of their de&s;ign. Henry, having taken this precaution, &s;ummoned a council to de|liberate upon mea&s;ures for re&s;training the furious conduct of the archbi&s;hop, whom &s;ome of the a&s;&s;embly advi&s;ed him to pro&s;ecute and put to death as a tray|tor; but this propo&s;al he rejected, though it was re&s;olved to take Becket into

All the&s;e &s;teps, however, were rendered unnece&s;&s;ary by the di&s;patch of the four barons, who being joined by twelve other knights at the ca&s;tle of Saltwode, belonging to Ralf de Broke, they proceeded &s;orthwith to Canterbury. The a&s;&s;i&s;tants were intended to keep the citizens quiet, while the barons, entering the palace, &s;ecured the great gates, and &s;eized two or three of the knights belonging to the family; the&s;e they committed to the charge of their followers; then they advanced to Becket's apartment, and expo&s;tulated warmly with him about the ra&s;hne&s;s and in&s;olence of his conduct. He a&s;&s;erted, that the &s;piritualities of his &s;ee were derived from the pope; that he held nothing of the king but the temporalities; and upbraided three of them with their ingratitude to him who had retained them in his &s;ervice while he enjoyed the po&s;t of chancellor. The&s;e reproaches provoked them to &s;uch a de|gree, that they re&s;olved to deprive him of his life, and retired to put on their armour. During this interval he might have e&s;caped, but he either pre&s;umed too much on his &s;acred character, or a&s;pired to the glory of martyrdom. Not|with&s;tanding the intreaties of the monks, who apprehended mi&s;chief, he deter|mined to a&s;&s;i&s;t at ve&s;pers, and pa&s;&s;ed through the cloi&s;ter of the convent into the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vit.

<P>The circum&s;tances of the murder, which were extremely barbarous, the place in which it was perpetrated, and the fortitude with which he re&s;igned him&s;elf to his fate, con&s;pired to inhance his character in the opinion of the vul|gar, who now lamented him as a &s;aint, whom they had before dete&s;ted as a trai|tor. The doors of the church being left open by the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, the people ru&s;hed in to &s;ee the body, and dipping their fingers in his blood, cro&s;&s;ed their foreheads with great devotion, believing them&s;elves &s;anctified by the blood of a holy martyr. The monks had laid it upon the high altar; but hearing that the murderers intended to return and throw it into &s;ome indecent and unhallowed place, they buried it privately in a &s;tone coffin, near the &s;pot on which he &s;uf|fered; but it was afterwards, by order of pope Honorius II. taken up with great &s;olemnity, and depo&s;ited in a &s;umptuo $s &s;hrine, at the expence of arch|bi&s;hop Langton. As for the perpetrators of the fact they retired to the ca&s;tle of Knare&s;borough in York&s;hire, belonging to Hugh de Moreville, where they remained a whole year &s;ecluded from all &s;ociety; but, tired at la&s;t of &s;olitude, and commanded by the king to &s;ubmit to the pope's judgment, they went to Rome, and were ordered to make a pilgrimage to Jeru&s;alem. Thus fell the ce|lebrated<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt.

Pope Alexander, for the honour of the papacy, and the encou|ragement of other enthu&s;ia&s;ts, canonized him about two years after his death, without the u&s;ual proce&s;s, or any formal examination of his pretended miracles.

<P>Becket's death was no &s;ooner known on the continent, th$n the king of France, and Th$obald, count of B$ois, pre&s;&s;ed the pope to un&s;heath St. Pe|ter's &s;word, and revenge the &s;acrilegious murder; and the archbi&s;hop of Sens, by virtue of his legatine powers in France, laid all Henry's foreign dominions<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ep. S. Tho.</NOTE> under an interdict; which Alexander confirmed. Even the Engli&s;h nation looked upon the deed with horror; and the monks perceiving the di&s;po&s;i|tion<NOTE PLACE="marg">$n. Ch. 1171.</NOTE> of the people, inflamed it to &s;uch a degree with &s;tories of dieams, ap|paritions, and miracles, that &s;uper&s;tition triumphed over common &s;en&s;e, and Henry was no longer ma&s;ter of the kingdom: &s;o that this murder broke all his mea&s;ures, and forced him to compliances, which Becket, had he been alive, could not have extorted from him with all his &s;piritual artillery. He received the advice of this unlucky affair at Argentan, and, fore&s;eeing all the mi&s;chie|vous con&s;equences of it, could not help breaking forth into a mo&s;t bitter lamen|tation: nay, &s;o much was he affected with the news, that he &s;hut him&s;elf up three days in his chamber, and refu&s;ed all manner of &s;u&s;tenance and comfort. At length his nobility and prelates were with difficulty admitted, and repre&s;enting the nece&s;&s;ity of taking &s;ome &s;teps to prevent the mi&s;chiefs that might redound from this melancholy event, he appointed amba&s;&s;adors to vindicate his character at the court of Rome. They departed immediately, and, after a very dangerous and fatiguing journey, arrived at Fra&s;cati, where they found two of Becket's adherents &s;ol$i$iting again&s;t the king; and the pope &s;o incen&s;ed, that it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty they could obtain an audience. Maunday Thur&s;day being the fe&s;tival on which the pope denounces ecc$e&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ures, the amba&s;&s;adors were afraid, that he would excommunicate the king by name, and could find no other expedient to avert the &s;entence, than that of &s;wearing before a full con|&s;i&s;tory, that the king would &s;tand to the pope's judgment. Thus appea&s;ed, Alex|ander contented him&s;elf with fulminating the &s;entence again&s;t the actors, aiders, abettors, advi&s;ers, and approvers of Becket's death, and all that harboured or re|ceived the murderers: but the bi&s;hops of the emba&s;&s;y, with all their intreaties and remon&s;trances, could not prevent his confirming the interdict, which had been laid upon his Norman dominions. All the benefit they reaped from their negociation, was a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion from further proceedings, until the pope &s;hould &s;end two legates into Normandy to examine into the particulars of Becket's death, and take cognizance of the king's humiliat$on: even this was purcha&s;ed at the expence of forty thou&s;and marks of &s;ilver, and five thou&s;and of gold,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brady.</NOTE> which Henry was fain to defray, rather than incur the re&s;entment of the pope, at a juncture, when his &s;ubjects were on the point of renouncing their allegiance. The $egates p opo&s;ed for this commi&s;&s;ion were the cardinals Albert and Theo|dun, from whom the king expected nothing but &s;everity, con&s;idering the pre|&s;ent temper of the pope, irritated by the deed it&s;elf, and inflamed by the &s;ug|ge&s;tions

<P>He was now indeed obliged to exert all his policy and addre&s;s in avoiding a war with his neighbours on the continent, and in protracting the mi&s;&s;ion of the legates, until the novelty and horror of Becket's death &s;hould gradually dimini&s;h and decay. He thought it would be nece&s;&s;ary to divert the attention of his people from this melancholy &s;ubject, by engaging in &s;ome &s;pe|cious enterprize that would captivate their fancy, and enhance his own reputa|tion. He fore&s;aw that nothing could an&s;wer the&s;e purpo&s;es more effectually than a conque&s;t of Ireland; a de&s;ign which he had formed in the beginning of his reign, and towards the execution of which he had obtained a grant of that i&s;land from pope Adrian IV. under pretence of propagating the go&s;pel, and cor|recting the vices of the inhabitants. He now re&s;olved to embark in this expe|dition, which appeared the more ea&s;y, as &s;everal private adventurers had already made great progre&s;s in that country. The original pretext for this war, was that the Iri&s;h had taken &s;ome natives of England, and &s;old them for &s;laves: but the motives that induced Adrian, who was him&s;elf an Engli&s;hman, to in|dulge Henry with the brief, was, exclu&s;ive of a national partiality, the pro&s;|&s;pect of adding to the power and revenues of the Roman &s;ee; for it was expre&s;ly &s;tipulated, that he &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h the tribute of Peter-pence over all the i&s;land.</P>

<P>The conque&s;t of Ireland was facilitated by its own inte&s;tine divi|&s;ions. The inhabitants lived in &s;epts or clans under different chieftains; and a number of the&s;e owned the &s;overeignty of a &s;uperior, who extended his autho|rity over a large di&s;trict. The country was antiently divided into five &s;uch kingdoms; namely, Ul&s;ter, Meath, Mun&s;ter, Lein&s;ter, and Connaught; and of the five princes who ruled the&s;e divi&s;ions, he that was mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for his valour, wi&s;dom, and power, was, by the others, elected and acknowledged king or monarch of Ireland; who enjoyed the &s;ame preheminence of rank and prerogative of pre&s;iding in the general a&s;&s;embly, as had been formerly ve&s;ted in the monarch or chief of the Saxon confederacy: but, be&s;ides the&s;e principal &s;o|vereigns, a great number of le&s;&s;er potentates in Ireland a&s;&s;umed the appellation of king, which, in their language, implied no more than lord or &s;uperior. Ire|land was never &s;ubdued by the Romans, though it agreed to pay tribute to that people, for the conveniency of trade with different parts of the empire. It was invaded by Egfrid, king of Northumberland, who was obliged to de&s;i&s;t from his enterprize with precipitation and di&s;grace. The Danes afterwards made de&s;cents upon the country: though they were generally repul&s;ed, until the famous Tur|gis landed with a powerful army, and &s;ubdued the greate&s;t part of Connaught, Ul&s;ter, Meath, and Lein&s;ter. That prince triumphed about thirty years; but was at la&s;t &s;lain by Melachlin, king of Meath, in the i&s;le of Lochvair, and the greate&s;t part of his forces, di&s;per&s;ed in different provinces of the country, were cut off by the natives. The next de&s;cent was made by Aulaf and his two bro|thers, from Norway, who tran&s;ported a &s;trong body of forces to Ireland, and built the cities of Dublin, Waterford, and Limerick, as capitals of three di&s;|tinct kingdoms, comprehending a &s;mall extent of territory along the &s;ea-&s;ide, which they fortified with ca&s;tles, and maintained with occa&s;ional &s;upplies from Norway and the we&s;tern i&s;les of Scotland. The native Iri&s;h kings po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an
<PB N="336" REF="3450">
open country, without any other forts than their woods and bogs; and their people lived in a &s;avage manner, di&s;per&s;ed, half-naked, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ting upon roots, milk, and cattle, without engaging in agriculture; while the Danes, un|der the name of Ea&s;terlings, carried on different branches of traffic, which ena|bled them to purcha&s;e the nece&s;&s;aries of life. When the&s;e invaders landed, the Iri&s;h were renowned for learning; but$ the rage of the Danes falling chiefly on<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ware$$ Antiq. H$bern. Topogr.

Having no manufacture or mechanic art to employ their attention, they became &s;lothful and vicious; and the influ|ence of chri&s;tianity was almo&s;t quite extingui&s;hed; f$r their bi&s;hops and clergy were infected with the idlene&s;s of their countrymen, and took no pains to en|force duties of religion, or &s;uperintend the morals of the people.</P>

<P>Such was the &s;ituation of the Iri&s;h, when Dermot Macmorrogh, king of Lein&s;ter, carried off Dervogill, daughter of Melachlin, prince of Meath, and wife of Tigernac O Rourke, lord of Breany, who being joined by O Connor, king of Connaught, and monarch of Ireland, marched again&s;t the ravi&s;her, routed his forces, and compelled him to take refuge in England. Henry being at this time in Guienne, Dermot went thither, and offered to hold his kingdom of the Engli&s;h crown, if he &s;hould recover it by the king's a&s;&s;i&s;|tance. The propo&s;al was reli&s;hed, and Henry having other employment for his own forces, granted letters-patent, allowing any of his Engli&s;h &s;ubjects to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Iri&s;h prince. Dermot returning to Bri&s;tol, agreed to be&s;tow his only daugh|ter Eva in marriage upon Richard, &s;urnamed Strongbow, lord of Strigal and earl of Pembroke, and to declare him his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, in con&s;ideration of a body of forces which the earl furni&s;hed for his re&s;toration. He at the &s;ame time con|tracted for &s;uccours with Robert Fitz&s;tephens and Maurice Fitzgerald, whom he promi&s;ed to gratify with the city of Wexford, and the two adjoining di&s;tricts, though at that time in the hands of the Ea&s;terlings: then he retired privately to Ireland, and concealed him&s;elf during the winter in the mona&s;tery of Ferns, which he had founded.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; LXIX.</HEAD>
<P>In the &s;ucceeding &s;pring, Robert Fitz&s;tephens, with his nephew Meyler Fitzhenry, Milo Fitzdavid, and Hervey de Montmerency, landed in Bannogh Bay, in the county of Wexford, with &s;ixty knights, and three hundred archers, and being joined by Maurice de Prenderga&s;t with a &s;mall reinforce|ment, and afterwards by the troops of Dermot, they advanced to the &s;iege of Wexford; which was &s;oon reduced. The Iri&s;h king made it over immediately to Robert and Maurice, with the territories, according to promi&s;e; and be&s;towed two other di&s;tricts near the &s;ea, betwixt Wexford and Waterford, on Hervey de Montmerency, from whom they devolved to the hou&s;e of Ormond. Dermot's next expedition was again&s;t Donald, king of O&s;&s;ory, who was routed and &s;ub|dued by the valour of the Engli&s;h. Roderic, monarch of Ireland, alarmed at the&s;e conque&s;ts, &s;ollicited all the petty kings of the i&s;land to join their forces, and &s;top the progre&s;s of the&s;e invaders; but, in the mean time, endeavoured by a negociation to prevail upon them to leave the country. Failing in this attempt, he concluded a private treaty with Dermot, to who&s;e &s;on he agreed to give his daughter in marriage: but a new reinforcement arriving from England, under the command of Maurice Fitzgerald, he renounced his engagement, and
<PB N="337" REF="3460">
undertook the &s;iege of Dublin, which in a little time capitulated, and was left in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of A&s;culf, the Dani&s;h prince, to whom it belonged.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="70" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; LXX.</HEAD>
<P>Dermot not contented with the recovery of his lands in Lein&s;ter, re&s;olved to reduce Connaught al&s;o to his obedience; but Robert and Maurice being con&s;ulted on the &s;ubject, advi&s;ed him to wait for the arrival of further &s;uc|cours; and to remind Richard Strongbow of his promi&s;e. That nobleman, though prohibited by Henry to embark in this expedition, &s;ent over Remond le Gros with ten cavaliers and &s;eventy archers, who landed at Dundevil, in the neighbourhood of Waterford, where they were immediately attacked by a body of three thou&s;and Danes and Iri&s;h, whom they defeated with great &s;laughter, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Henry de Montmerency, who came accidentally with a party of his followers to vi&s;it Remond. In about three months after this action, Rich|ard in per&s;on made a de&s;cent, with two hundred knights and half that number of archers, near Waterford; which he took by a&s;&s;ault, and there he found Reynold, prince of the Dani&s;h inhabitants, and Malachias O Phelan, lord of Decies. In this city Richard's marriage was &s;olemnized with Eva, and he and his wife declared &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Dermot, who&s;e &s;on was, at that time, ho&s;tage with Roderic, for performance of the treaty which the father had concluded with that prince. From Waterford the earl advanced to Dublin, which he likewi&s;e took by &s;torm; while A&s;culf, with a great number of the inhabitants, e&s;caped by &s;ea to the Orkneys: then they ravaged the country of Meath, till the approach of winter, when leaving Miles Cogan with a garri&s;on in Dublin, Strongbow re|turned to Waterford, and Dermot retired to Ferns.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="71" TYPE="section">

<P>The&s;e conque&s;ts alarmed Henry, king of England, who took um|brage at the &s;ucce&s;s of Richard, already too powerful by his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Wales, his connections and alliances. A proclamation was therefore publi&s;hed, command|ing all the &s;ubjects of England to return to their own country, and forbidding any further &s;uccours to be &s;ent into Ireland. In con&s;equence of this order Rich|ard di&s;patched Remond to Normandy, with letters full of expre&s;&s;ions of duty and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the king, and offers to re&s;ign into his maje&s;ty's hands all the conque&s;ts he had atchieved. By the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions he retrieved the favour of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hibern. Ex|pug.</NOTE> Henry, who ordered his lands, which had been &s;eque&s;tered, to be re&s;tored, and created him &s;ene&s;chal of Ireland; and Dermot dying in the interim, he became<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gul.

A&s;culf having a&s;&s;embled a con&s;iderable body of forces in Norway, the Orkneys, and Hebrides, tran&s;ported them in three&s;core &s;hips to the mouth of the Liffy, and made an attempt upon Dublin; but, he was de|feated and taken by Miles Cogan, who ordered him to be put to death, for hav|ing reviled him in abu&s;ive language. Mean while Roderic was employed in making great preparations for the expul&s;ion of the Engli&s;h. He levied a numerous army in his own territories and tho&s;e of his neighbours, and was reinforced with a &s;trong body of auxiliaries, by Godred, king of Man and the We&s;tern I&s;lands; with the&s;e he inve&s;ted Dublin, into which Richard had thrown him&s;elf with a &s;mall &s;upply of forces. The place was blocked up in &s;uch a manner, that the be&s;ieged could receive no provi&s;ion; &s;o that famine mu&s;t have en&s;ued, had not Strongbow made a &s;ally one morning, and fallen &s;uddenly upon the enemy with &s;uch fury, that they were immediately routed with great &s;laughter. Then Richard marched to the relief of Robert Fitz&s;tephens, who was be&s;ieged in

Carrey, near Wexford, by the Danes of tho&s;e parts, and Donald, an illegiti|mate &s;on of king Dermot: but before the earl arrived, Fitz&s;tephens had &s;ur|rendered, on condition of being tran&s;ported to Wales.</P>

<P>By this time king Henry had re&s;olved to fini&s;h the conque&s;t in his own per&s;on.

In his progre&s;s through Wales, he had received the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of Re&s;e, and the &s;ons of Owen Guineth, among whom a civil war had broke out, from the conte&s;t about the government. This quarrel produced &s;uch mi&s;chief and effu&s;ion of blood, that Madoc, one of the brothers, re&s;olved to abandon his native country, and, having equipped a few &s;hips, &s;ailed with his adherents to the north of Ireland, in que&s;t of &s;ome new habitation; then &s;teering we&s;tward, arrived at an unknown land, which was in all probability the coa&s;t of America.

<P>But to return to Henry: he was no &s;ooner landed in Ireland, than the natives &s;ubmitted; and as for Strongbow, he had, in obedience to the king's order, conveyed by Hervey de Montmerency, returned to England and met the king at Newenham, in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, when he re&s;igned to his maje&s;ty all the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, in Ireland, which he held in right of his wife or by conque&s;t: and Henry reconvey|ed to him, as a fief of the crown, the whole province of Lein&s;ter, except the city of Dublin, with the adjacent countries, and &s;ome maritime towns and ca&s;tles. In Richard's ab&s;ence Tigernack O Rourke had made another attempt upon Dub|lin, and been defeated by Miles Cogan: and this was the la&s;t effort of the Danes and Iri&s;h to maintain their independency; for when the king landed, the whole country &s;ubmitted. He had &s;ent Robert Fitz-Bernard before him to take po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of Waterford, where Richard now did homage for his province of Lein&s;ter. There too, Dermot Maccarty, king of Corke, &s;wore fealty, and delivered ho&s;tages for the payment of an annual tribute. After a fortnight's &s;tay at Waterford, Henry marched to Le&s;more and Ca&s;hel, and received the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of Donald, king of O&s;$ory; Malachias or Melachlin O Phelan, king of Decies; Reynald, prince of Waterford, and Donald O Brian, king of Thomond or Limerick. The&s;e he received with great kindne&s;s, and enriched with valuable pre&s;ents: but at the &s;ame time he &s;ecured Corke, Limerick, and Wexford, with &s;trong garri&s;ons, in order to enforce their obedience. From Mun&s;ter he made a progre&s;s thro' O&s;$ory to Dublin, where he received the homage of Richard O Carol, king of Uriel or Ergall, Tigernack O Rourke, and other princes in the neighbourhood

of that metropolis; and their example was at la&s;t followed by Roderic O Conno$$ monarch of Ireland, who met Hugh de Lacey and William Fitz-Aldelm, as Henry's amba&s;&s;adors, on the banks of the Shannon, where he &s;wore fealty to Henry, king of England, and obliged him&s;elf to pay an annual tribute. Thus he became ma&s;ter of the greate&s;t part of Ireland without the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition; and all the&s;e tributary princes attended at his court, which was kept at Dublin, dur|ing<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hibern.

<P>All the bi&s;hops of Ireland had repaired to Waterford, at Henry's landing, to welcome him on his arrival, and take the oath of allegiance; for they expected from his piety, wi&s;dom, and ju&s;tice, a full reformation of the di&s;or|ders and immoralities, which their influence alone could not eradicate. The common people among the Engli&s;h, under the Saxon government, had been u&s;ed to &s;ell their children as &s;laves to the Iri&s;h; and this practice, though con|demned by the eccle&s;ia&s;tical canons, was &s;till carried on after the Norman conque&s;t, to the great &s;candal of Chri&s;tianity. The Iri&s;h bi&s;hops therefore, &s;uppo&s;ing this infamous traffic had drawn upon the Engli&s;h the judgement of God, in the Norman conque&s;t, and that Ireland, for encouraging it, was now en&s;laved in its turn, a&s;&s;embled a &s;ynod at Armagh, where, with the general con|&s;ent of the nobility, all the Engli&s;h &s;laves were ordered to be &s;et at liberty; a law, by which they effectually made their court to their new ma&s;ter. <NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>The winter he pa&s;&s;ed in Ireland was &s;o &s;tormy, that, for &s;everal months, all corre&s;pondence with England was interrupted, till the king re|moved from Dublin to Wexford, where he received advice that the cardinals Albert and Theodin had waited for him in Normandy, till their patience was quite exhau&s;ted; and then they threatened to excommunicate him for the mur|der of Becket, in ca&s;e he &s;hould not come over immediately, and clear him&s;elf of that accu&s;ation. At the &s;ame time he was informed of a dangerous con&s;pi|racy again&s;t his government, both in England and Normandy, as well as of en|deavours, which had been u&s;ed to alienate the affections of his own children.

Though he had propo&s;ed to pa&s;s the &s;ummer in Ireland, and make an expedition into Connaught, when the roads &s;hould be practicable, he no &s;ooner received tho&s;e alarming advices, than he ordered his troops to embark with the officers of his hou&s;hold, and &s;et &s;ail from Waterford to England, while he only kept three &s;hips for him&s;elf and his attendants, as he could not cro&s;s the &s;ea in per&s;on until he &s;hould have taken mea&s;ures for &s;ecuring his conque&s;ts, as well again&s;t the attempts of the Iri&s;h princes, as from the ambition of Richard Strongbow, whom he &s;till beheld with an eye of jealou&s;y. With this view he had detached Remond le gros, Miles Cogan, William Macarel, and others, from the earl's intere&s;ts, and committed the governments of all the fortified places to per&s;ons of known fidelity. He granted the hundred of Offaly to Robert Fitz&s;tephens; Waterford was entru&s;ted to Robert Poer; Wexford to William Fitz-Aldhelm; and Dublin to Hugh de Lacy; with &s;ufficient garri&s;ons under their command.

<P>This di&s;po&s;ition being &s;ettled, as well as the circum&s;tances of the time would permit, he embarked in the morning at Wexford, and landed that &s;ame day at Port&s;inan, near St. David's, in Pembroke&s;hire; and as it was his intere&s;t to give immediate &s;atisfaction to the legates, he pa&s;&s;ed through England without halting, till he reached Port&s;mouth, from whence he carried the young king with him into Normandy. His fir&s;t conference with the cardinals at Gor|ham, pa&s;&s;ed in compliment and ceremony; but next day, when they met at Sa|vigny, in pre&s;ence of the archbi&s;hop of Rouen, and a great number of prelates and nobility, the legates in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;uch unrea&s;onable terms, that the king withdrew in a great pa&s;&s;ion, declaring he would return to fini&s;h the conque&s;t of Ireland, and they might do what they plea&s;ed with their legatine commi&s;&s;ion. The cardinals pe$ceiving his fortitude and re&s;olution, were fain to abate in their demands, and de&s;ired another conference might be appointed at Avranches, where, after much altercation and debate, it was at la&s;t agreed, by both parties, that the king &s;hould pay to the knights templars, a &s;um of money &s;ufficient for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of two hundred knights, to be employed one year in the de|fence of the Holy Land: that he him&s;elf &s;hould take the cro&s;s, and &s;erve in per|&s;on again&s;t the in&s;idels, either in Pale&s;tine or Spain, if the pope &s;hould in&s;i&s;t up|on the performance of this article; that he &s;hould not interrupt the free cour&s;e of appeals to Rome, in eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es; nor enforce the ob&s;ervance of evil cu&s;toms, introduced &s;ince his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne; that he &s;hould re&s;tore all the lands which had been ahenated from the &s;ee of Canterbury, &s;ince the exile of Becker; and that he &s;hould re-e&s;tabli&s;h all per&s;ons who had &s;uffered for their adherence to that bi&s;hop, in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their e&s;tates. To the performance of the&s;e conditions, Henry and his &s;on &s;wore in the cathedral of Avranches; and the father, of his own accord, prote&s;ted upon oath, that he was in no &s;hape a willing acce&s;&s;ary to the death of Becket, which had overwhelmed him with grief and anxiety; but as the archbi&s;hop had been murdered, in con&s;equence of the di&s;plea&s;ure he had expre&s;&s;ed at that prelate's proceedings, he would perform the penance pre&s;cribed. He was then led out of the church by the legates, and,

falling upon his knees, received ab&s;olution, which was no &s;ooner granted, than they re-conducted him into the cathedral, without &s;ubjecting him to the di&s;ci|pline, and obliging him to &s;hift his clothes, or undergo any penitential ceremo|ny.

<P>THE cardinals, having &s;o happily &s;ucceeded in compleating this re|conciliation between his holine&s;s and Henry, re&s;olved to exert them|&s;elves in effecting another between that prince and Lewis king of France, who re&s;ented Henry's non-performance of the promi&s;e he had made to crown his daughter Margaret together with her hu&s;band. In con&s;equence of their media|tion, the young king and this prince&s;s were &s;ent over to England, with the arch|bi&s;hop of Rouen, who anointed and crowned her with her con&s;ort, in the church of St. Swithin at Winche&s;ter, being a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the ceremony by the bi&s;hops of Evreux and Worce&s;ter. Some time after this &s;olemnity, the young king and queen returned to Normandy, from whence they &s;et out on a vi&s;it to the king of France, at the earne&s;t reque&s;t of that monarch, who was extremely fond of his daughter.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; II.</HEAD>
<P>Henry's affairs were now in a mo&s;t flouri&s;hing condition: he had in|crea&s;ed the revenue of Normandy, which obeyed him without repining: he had made an acqui&s;ition of the kingdom of Ireland; was ma&s;ter of all Bretagne by the death of Conan, who&s;e daughter had e&s;pou&s;ed his &s;on Geoffrey: he had formed an alliance with Alphon&s;o, king of Ca&s;tile, to whom he had given his daughter Eleanor in marriage: he had projected a match between his younge&s;t &s;on John, and Adelais daughter of Humbert count of Savoy: he was delivered from all his eccle&s;ia&s;tical troubles, by his reconciliation with the pope; and he was beloved by all his &s;ubjects, who lived happily under his admini&s;tration. But his happi|ne&s;s was now poi&s;oned by dome&s;tic di&s;quiet. His &s;on Henry was a weak, vain, ambitious prince, who affected a popularity which he acquired by the mo&s;t pro|fu&s;e large&s;&s;es. His extravagance and exce&s;&s;es involved him in want and diffi|culties, which his &s;ettled appointments did not enable him to overcome: he found him&s;elf hampered by the oeconomy, and eclip&s;ed by the &s;uperior impor|tance of his father; he longed to reign without re&s;tra$nt; and his heart renounced the ties of natural affection. This di&s;po&s;ition was indu&s;triou&s;ly cultivated by his favourites and &s;ycophants, of which the chief were Hugh de St. Maure, and Ralf de Faye, the uncle of queen Eleanor, who, in all probability, acted in this particular as the emi&s;&s;aries of the French king, jealous of Henry's power and pro&s;perity. During the young king's re&s;idence at that court, every artifice was u&s;ed to inflame his di&s;content, and irritate him again&s;t his father. Lewis ob|&s;erved that he was no more than the &s;hadow of royalty; that his power was even more circum&s;cribed than that of a private nobleman; that his appointments were meanly par&s;imonious; that the re&s;trictions impo&s;ed upon his authority, were not
<PB N="344" REF="3530">
only inconveniences, but in&s;ults upon his under&s;tanding; and that he was in|titled to the independent government of the kingdom, ever &s;ince the ceremony of his coronation. When he had thus wrought upon the pa&s;&s;ions of the young prince, he undertook to &s;uperintend his conduct, and in&s;tructed him with regard to the mea&s;ures he &s;hould take for his own glory and advantage. Thus tutored he returned to Normandy at the de&s;ire of his father, who began to be unea&s;y at<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. Paris. G. Neub. Hoved. Rob. de Monte.</NOTE> his &s;taying &s;o long in a place, where he knew de&s;igns were often hatching to his prejudice; and immediately after his arrival, he demanded that the old king would re&s;ign to him the ab&s;olute government of England or Normandy: a pro|po&s;al with which the father refu&s;ed to comply.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; III.</HEAD>
<P>In the beginning of the &s;ucceeding year, the king, with Eleanor and his elde&s;t &s;on, proceeded to Limoges, where they were met by Raymond, count de St. Giles, who came to do homage for the county of Tholou&s;e; and Humbert, count of Savoy, to fini&s;h the treaty of marriage between prince John and his daughter Adelais. The portion of this young prince&s;s con&s;i&s;ted of very con&s;i|derable deme&s;nes in La Bre&s;&s;e, Dauphiny, Savoy and Piedmont; and the king agreed to be&s;tow upon John, be&s;ides a large &s;um of money, the ca&s;tles of Lou|dun, Mirebeau, and Chinon. This alliance would have proved very advan|tageous to the king of England, had it not been prevented by the death of the prince&s;s: but it was upon this occa&s;ion, that young Henry fir&s;t expre&s;&s;ed his di&s;content, by flatly refu&s;ing to join in the grant of tho&s;e ca&s;tles to his brother. The father now, for the fir&s;t time, di&s;covered his &s;on's aver&s;ion to his per&s;on and government, and imputing it to evil advice, removed A&s;culf de Hilaire, and &s;ome other young knights from his communication: a &s;tep which &s;erved only to ha&s;ten his retreat; for, when the court returned to Chinon, he privately withdrew into France, where Lewis had promi&s;ed to e&s;pou&s;e his quarrel. The king, extremely concerned at his di&s;appearing, &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to the French king, de&s;iring that he would not countenance a rebellious &s;on again&s;t his father, and offering to &s;ubmit all Henry's preten&s;ions to his arbitration: but the propo|&s;al was rejected with di&s;dain; and Lewis, in a taunting letter, affirmed that he had re&s;igned all his right to the crown of England, at his &s;on's coronation. Young Henry's retreat was the fir&s;t overtact of a con&s;piracy, which &s;eems to have been formed during the father's re&s;idence in Ireland. A great number of Norman barons, who, upon the late inqui&s;ition, had lo&s;t e&s;tates, which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by defective titles, now expected to recover their lands, and followed young Henry to the court of France: others more con&s;iderable &s;taid at home, but openly declared in his favour, and &s;urrendered their ca&s;tles for his &s;ervice. Guy and Geoffrey de Luzignan, with a number of the lords in Anjou and Guienne, followed their example; and an in&s;urrection was rai&s;ed in Brittany by Ralf de Fougeres and Eudo, vi&s;count Parhoet, father-in-law to the late duke Conan. The&s;e troubles were encouraged by queen Eleanor, who, as well as Richard and Geoffrey, had by this time embarked in the rebellion, not in&s;tigated by jealou&s;y of her hu&s;band's amour with the fair Ro&s;amond, daughter of Wal|ter de Clifford, a baron of Hereford&s;hire, as &s;ome hi&s;torians have alledged, but inflamed with re&s;entment at the king's leaving her no part of the admini&s;tra|tion of her own native po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions on the continent; and influenced by her partial fondne&s;s for her own off&s;pring. Ro&s;amond mu&s;t have been by this time in the wane of her beauty, ina&s;much as the younger of the &s;ons &s;he bore to

Henry was now turned of twenty years of age. Eleanor's &s;econd &s;on Richard had already given &s;pecimens of a turbulent di&s;po&s;ition, and thought him&s;elf entitled to the admini&s;tration of Poitou, becau&s;e he had received the in|ve&s;titure of that county; and Geoffrey, though but fifteen, had the &s;ame claim to Bretagne: but at pre&s;ent they acted under the immediate direction of their mother, who not only per&s;uaded them to e&s;cape into France, and join Henry, but attempted to follow their example. She di&s;gui&s;ed her&s;elf in man's apparel; but, before &s;he could accompli&s;h her retreat, was taken in that di&s;gui&s;e, and committed to clo&s;e pri&s;on, where &s;he was kept many years, as the principal cau&s;e of all this di&s;turbance. <NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

<P>Henry finding him&s;elf be&s;et with enemies in this manner, abandoned by his own wife and children, threatened with the vengeance of Lewis, king of France, who profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf the patron of the confederacy, &s;urrounded with in&s;urrections in all parts of his dominions, and even expo&s;ed to the ri&s;que of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination; he &s;ummoned all his fortitude and re&s;olution to oppo&s;e &s;uch a torrent of misfortune; &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to intere&s;t the pope in his behalf; filled the &s;ee of Canterbury with Richard, prior of Dover, a prelate of a mild di&s;po&s;ition, whom the pope afterwards con&s;ecrated and inve&s;ted with the primacy; and took into his &s;ervice twenty thou&s;and &s;oldiers of fortune, called Brabantins and Banditti, who &s;ub&s;i&s;ted upon plunder, and were ready to engage in the &s;ervice of any prince who could pay them punctually. They were generally natives of France, Germany, and the Low Countries, who, having &s;erved under different banners, were inured to danger, fatigue, and military di&s;cipline, and &s;o habituated to war, that they could not re&s;ume the employments and avocations of peace. Perhaps this was as wi&s;e a &s;tep as he could take at a time of general defection, when he could not tru&s;t his own &s;ubjects; for, by this time, the contagion had &s;pread into England, where the earls of Che&s;ter and Leice&s;ter had pub|licly avowed their attachment to young Henry: &s;everal barons, to whom he had committed the charge of &s;trong fortre&s;&s;es in Normandy, had betrayed their tru&s;t; and therefore he garri&s;oned the re&s;t with part of his mercenaries, and kept a body of the &s;ame troops ready to march where&s;oever their &s;ervice &s;hould be more immediately required.</P>

Henry, being furni&s;hed with a new &s;eal by the direction of his father-in-law, di&s;po&s;ed of the crown deme&s;nes with a lavi&s;h hand, to &s;everal princes who e&s;pou&s;ed his quarrel.

During the&s;e tran&s;actions the French king, at the head of a great army, invaded Normandy on the &s;ide of the Pais Chartrain, and undertook the &s;iege of Ver|nueil, which was gallantly defended by Hugh de Beauchamp and Hugh de La|cy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>Henry, who was encamped at Conches, being apprized of this agree|ment, immediately began his march, and though inferior in point of number to the French, re&s;olved to hazard an engagement.

<P>Such a blow could not fail to ruin their &s;cheme in Brittany, where all, who had taken arms, &s;ubmitted to Henry's mercy; and the fame of his &s;ucce&s;s, re-e&s;tabli&s;hed his affairs in other parts of his dominions. Some of the adherents of the young princes, di&s;appointed in their &s;anguine hopes, and ap|prehen&s;ive of being ruined by the revolt, advi&s;ed them to make propo&s;als of peace, to which Henry lent a willing ear. Conferences were opened near Gi&s;ors, between the kings of France and England, at which the young princes a&s;&s;i&s;ted, with a great number of prelates and nobility. Henry offered to &s;ettle upon his elde&s;t &s;on half of the revenue of England, with four places of &s;trength in that king|dom: or &s;hould he chu&s;e to re&s;ide in Normandy, half the revenue of the dutchy, the whole of Anjou, with &s;ix ca&s;tles. He propo&s;ed, that Richard &s;hould have half the revenue of Guienne, with four ca&s;tles; that Geoffrey &s;hould be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Conan's territories in Bretagne, provided the pope would grant a di&s;pen&s;ation for his marriage with the heire&s;s; and he declared that, if this pro|vi&s;ion &s;hould not be thought &s;ufficient, he would refer the di&s;pute to the arbitra|tion of the archbi&s;hop of Tarentai&s;e and the pope's legates; re&s;erving to him&s;elf, however, the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, with all the other branches of the regal prerogative. Lewis, who&s;e intere&s;t it was to &s;ee the empire of Henry di&s;|membred, began to &s;tart difficulties, and the young princes rejected the&s;e rea&s;on|able propo&s;als, chiefly at the in&s;tigation of Robert Blanches-Mains, earl of Lei|ce&s;ter, who was one of the fir&s;t projectors of this rebellion. He had come over from England with William de Tancarville, to &s;uccour the revolters with a large &s;um of money borrowed on his e&s;tate; and became the mo&s;t virulent parti&s;an of the whole faction. He, upon this occa&s;ion, broke out into the mo&s;t opprobri|ous invectives again&s;t the king, to whom he had lately renewed the oath of allegiance, and even laid his hand upon his &s;word, in order to excite a tumult; which put an end to the conference. The king and his &s;ons parted with great animo&s;ity: the latter became more and more attached to Lewis, who, about this period, knighted Richard in the &s;eventeenth year of his age; and this cam|paign<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoved.

<P>William, king of Scotland, in order to co-operate with the other confe|derates, invaded the northern counties in England, where his troops committed the mo&s;t barbarous outrages. After having made an un&s;ucce&s;$ful attempt upon Carli&s;le, he ravaged Northumberland, and penetrated as far as York&s;hire, from whence he carried off a va&s;t booty, and a great number of captives. He was pur&s;ued into his own country by Richard de Lacy, and Humphrey de Bohun, con&s;table of England, who followed him with a good army, burned Berwick, and wa&s;ted Lothian; but being informed of a de&s;cent in Suffolk, by the earl of Leice&s;ter, with a numerous body of Flemings, they agreed upon a truce with

During this interval, they marched again&s;t the invader, who was, by this time$ joined by Hugh Bigo$ with a multitude of his va&s;&s;als, and en|countring him on a mar&s;hy ground near Fernham, his forces were routed, he and his wife taken, and above ten thou&s;and Flemings killed upon the &s;pot.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rob. de.

<P>This ce&s;&s;ation from ho&s;tilities was employed in preparing for a vigo|rous renewal of the war.

<P>The truce with Scotland having expired, William, at the head of a numerous army, reinforced with a body of hor&s;e and foot from Flanders, made an irruption into Northumberland, where his Ga$lovidians committed horrible cruelties upon men, women, and children, laity as well as clergy, &s;ome of whom they ma&s;&s;acred even at the altar. David, earl of Huntingdon, was detached into Leice&s;ter&s;hire, to encourage an in&s;urrection in that country; while William re|mained in the north, where he reduced &s;everal &s;trong holds, and levied contri|but ons. During the&s;e tran&s;actions, Roger de Mowbray made excur&s;ions from his ca&s;tle of Kenard-Ferry over all Lincoln&s;hire; until his progre&s;s was &s;topped by Geoffrey the king's natural &s;on, now promoted to the &s;ee of Lincoln. This prela$e being exceedingly beloved by the people, a&s;&s;embled a body of forces, and &s;uddenly inve&s;ting the ca&s;tle of Kenard-Ferry, compelled Mowbray to &s;ur|render; then marching into York&s;hire, he reduced the ca&s;tle of Male&s;&s;art, which li$ewi&s;e belonged to this nobleman; compelled Hugh de Pu&s;ey, bi&s;hop of Durham, to take a new oath of allegiance; and advanced again&s;t the Scots, who had undertaken the &s;iege of Bowes, which however, they abandoned at his<NOTE PLACE="marg">I$. $b$d.</NOTE> approach.

In this emergency, Richard de Lacey, guardian of the realm, &s;ollicited the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Re&s;e, prince of South-Wales, who marched again&s;t earl Ferrers, and be&s;ieged his ca&s;tle of Tutbury in Stafford&s;hire, while Richard him&s;elf took the field with a numerous army, in order to oppo&s;e the young king and Philip, count of Flanders, who had a&s;&s;em|bled a formidable body of forces at Gravelines, with a view to invade England.</P>

<P>William, king of Scotland, had be&s;ieged Prudhaw ca&s;tle, until the Engli&s;h army under Ralf de Glanville, with a great number of other noblemen and York&s;hire barons, advancing to its relief, he thought proper to relinqui&s;h the enterprize, and retreat to Alnwick. There deeming him&s;elf &s;ecure from any attack, he detached the earl of Fife, Angus, and Richard de Moreville, con&s;ta|ble of Scotland, to ravage the adjoining countries, while he him&s;elf retained &s;carce any troops but tho&s;e of his hou&s;hold, for the defence of his own per&s;on. Ralf de Glanville being informed of this circum&s;tance, propo&s;ed to &s;ome of the principal barons, that they &s;hould &s;urprize William with four hundred hor&s;e; and the atchievement was undertaken by Robert d'E&s;touteville, Bernard de Ba|liol, William de Ve&s;ei, and Geoffrey of Lincoln, who &s;et out on this expedition with great &s;ecre&s;y.

<P>This exploit was of infinite con&s;equence to the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of Henry's affairs. The bi&s;hop of Durham had received a reinforcement of Flem|ings, and intended to declare his revolt immediately, when hearing of William's d$&s;a&s;ter$ he &s;ent them back to their own country, and remained quiet: David, earl of Huntington, rea&s;&s;embled the &s;cattered detachment of his brother's army, and reconducted them to Scotland, which was in&s;tantly involved in civil war and confu&s;ion, by a conte&s;t about the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Galloway; &s;o that the Engli&s;h rebels having no promi&s;e of further a&s;&s;i&s;tance from that country, &s;aw no &s;afety but in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The enterprize at Alnwick was celebrated with public re|joicings all over the kingdom; and Henry, in order to improve the advantage, before his enemies &s;hould recollect them&s;elves from the con&s;ternation occa&s;ioned among them by this unlucky event, marched immediately to the ca&s;tle of Hun|tingdon, which &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion: then he advanced again&s;t Hugh Bigot, who &s;ubmitted to the king's mercy, delivered his ca&s;tles, paid a thou&s;and marks, gave ho&s;tages, and took the oath of allegiance anew. The king having put gar|ri&s;ons in the forts, repaired to Northampton, where the bi&s;hop of Durham made his &s;ubmi&s;&s;$on, and re&s;igned his fortre&s;&s;es of Norham, Durham, and Northal|lerton. Roger de Mowbray, and the earl of Ferrers, threw them&s;elves at Hen|ry's feet, and were pardoned, upon yielding up the ca&s;tles of Thir&s;ke, Tutbury, and Duffield. Hither a$&s;o came Anchetel de Malory and William de Dive, con&s;tables of the earl of Leice&s;ter, to t$eat about their lord's liberty, and the &s;urrender of his &s;trong holds which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed: but the king giving them to under&s;tand that the earl had no favour to expect, but from their ab&s;olute &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, they &s;urrendered his ca&s;tles of Groby, Mont&s;orel, and Leice&s;ter: the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoved.

<P>While fortune wrought &s;uch wonders in behalf of Henry$ his &s;on and the count of Flanders, with their great armament, were detained for &s;ome time by contrary winds, and, when they at la&s;t ventured to &s;ea, di&s;per&s;ed in a &s;torm, which obliged them to p$t back to the port from whence they had taken their departure. There they received notice of William's capti$ity, and the old king's rapid &s;ucce&s;s$ by which their mea&s;ures being broken, they laid a&s;ide all thoughts of their ente$prize on England, and began their march to join the king of France$ who had entered Normandy with a va&s;t army, and inve&s;ted Rouen, the capital of the dut$$y. The city being very exten&s;ive, he found it impra$ticable, even after his junction with young Henry and the count of Flanders, to block it up entirely; and though he carried on his approaches with great vigour$ the inhabitants defended them&s;elves with &s;uch bravery and re&s;olution, that de&s;pairi$g of reducing it by open force, he had recour&s;e to a &s;$ratagem, which was not much for the honour of his reputation.

king's &s;incerity and devotion. While the citizens gave them&s;elves up to fea&s;t|ing, mirth and jollity, and their cavaliers cro&s;&s;ed the bridge to the &s;outh &s;ide of the river, where they divert$d them&s;elves in tilts and tournaments, in &s;ight of the enemy; a few prie&s;ts who did not chu&s;e to mix in the entertainments of the day, a&s;cended an high tower, in order to indulge their curio&s;ity with a pro&s;pect of the French camp. They were at fir&s;t &s;urprized at the unu&s;ual &s;ilence that prevailed over all their quarters; but, in a little time, perceiving detachments moving from different places to a general rendezvous, they began to &s;u&s;pect &s;ome treachery, and were &s;oon confirmed in that conjecture, by di&s;covering among them a number of ladders, and other implements for an a&s;&s;ault. They imme|diately rang the alarm bell, which happened to be in the very place from whence they made the&s;e ob&s;ervations. The citizens, &s;natching up their arms, ran di|rectly to the walls; and the hor&s;emen, exerci&s;ing on the other &s;ide of the river, repaired to their po&s;ts, with all imaginable expedition, though they were almo&s;t too late; for the enemy hearing the bell, had ha&s;tened their attack, applied their ladders; and &s;ome of the &s;oldiers had actually mounted the walls, before the defendants could take their &s;tations.

<P>This treacherous &s;cheme, was, in all probability, concerted to an|ticipate the diligence of Henry, who, being apprized of the danger that threatened his favourite capital, had immediately a&s;&s;embled his troops, and landed already at Barfleur with his Brabantins, reinforced by a thou&s;and Wel&s;h auxiliaries. He carried over with him the king of Scotland, the earls of Che&s;ter and Lei|ce&s;ter, and &s;ome other con&s;iderable captives, and &s;ecuring them at Caen and Falai&s;e, advanced to Rouen, which he entered in triumph on the Sunday that &s;uc|ceeded the perfidious attempt of the French. He forthwith ordered the gates to be thrown open, and the intrenchments between the city and the enemy's camp to be filled up, &s;o as to form a road of &s;ufficient breadth to admit a front of two hundred men, that he might have room enough to attack the be&s;iegers. He made &s;ome &s;ucce&s;sful &s;allies: his Wel&s;h troops intercepted a great convoy of provi&s;ions de&s;igned for the French camp: and Lewis was overwhelmed with con|&s;ternation; for he found him&s;elf in the mid&s;t of an enemy's country, de&s;titute of &s;upplies, &s;urrounded with woods and mountains, and expo&s;ed to the vigilance of an active monarch, at the head of veteran troops accu&s;tomed to victory. In this di&s;tre&s;s, he had recour&s;e to artifice and negotiation. He &s;ent the archbi&s;hop of Sens, and the count of Blois with overtures of peace; and though Henry had been duped on a former occa&s;ion, by the in&s;incere in&s;inuations of the&s;e very amba&s;&s;adors, he was &s;o aver&s;e to war, and unwilling to act again&s;t Lewis, whom he con&s;idered as his lord and &s;uperior, that he agreed to their propo&s;al of a con|ference to be held at Malauny, and a truce in the mean time, which they confirmed by oath in the name of their &s;overeign. On the faith of this agree|ment, Lewis retreated through the fore&s;t, unmole&s;ted, towards the place ap|pointed; but, in&s;tead of waiting for the conference, decamped at midnight, and marched homewards with &s;uch expedition, that next day, when his departure was known, it was with great difficulty that the Brabantins overtook the &s;trag|glers of his rear, who were cut in pieces. In a few days, however, the two amba&s;&s;adors returned to Rouen, and, after having made an apology for their

king's retreat, propo&s;ed another conference at Gi&s;ors, where a truce was con|cluded, after they had agreed upon a final $meeting at a place near Amboi&s;e, in order to adju&s;t the articles of a &s;olid peace, which could not now be e&s;tabli&s;hed on account of the ab&s;ence of prince Richard, who was employed in attacking his fath$r's ca&s;tles in Guienne. One of the articles of this truce imported that Henry &s;ho$ld be at liberty to reduce this rebellious &s;on, who &s;hould have no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Lewis or his brother. Thus left to his own efforts, he was hunted by his father from place to place; and finding him&s;elf abandoned by the French king, he repaired to Poitiers, where he humbled him&s;elf before his parent, who par|doned his unnatural conduct, and received him with all the warmth of paternal<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ma$ Pa$i$.

Far from offering hecatombs of the vanqui&s;hed to ju&s;tice or revenge, and deluging the land with the blood of his rebellious &s;ubjects, after the flames of civil war had been extingui&s;hed, his genero&s;ity and greatne&s;s of &s;oul di&s;dained &s;uch cruel victims; his compa&s;&s;ion operated in behalf o$ the di$tre&s;&s;ed offenders; he did not lay a&s;ide the father to exert the judge, but in his judgment remembred mercy. There was not one &s;caffold moi&s;tened with the blood of a nobleman; there was not one gibbet occupied by a rebel of plebeian rank. He relea&s;ed above nine hundred knights without ran&s;om; he be&s;towed a new grant of a yearly pen&s;ion upon the count of Flanders, who gave up the con|ventions he had made with young Henry; and he readmitted his own undutiful children into his favour, as if they had never tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed. When the princes of Galloway &s;hook off the Scotti&s;h yoke, and a&s;&s;erted their independency$ he had from the dictates of &s;ound policy, &s;upported them in their revolt; and Roger de Hoveden the hi&s;torian, who was one of his chaplains, had been &s;ent to treat with Gilbert, and the other chieftains of the country, who offered an annual tribute of money, cows and hogs, for his protection and a &s;$&s;tance, in re&s;cuing them from the dominion of the Scots; but, when Henry heard how barbarou&s;ly that prince had put his own brother Uchtred to death, he broke off all connexion with &s;uch inhuman people, and compromi&s;ed his difference with William, king of Scot|land.</P>

<P>The&s;e treaties being concluded and ratified, Henry had an interview with the king of France at Gi&s;ors, where all matters in di&s;pute between the two crowns, were &s;ettled to their mutual &s;atisfaction. The fortre&s;&s;es erected during the war were now demoli&s;hed, and the ca&s;tles of Anjou and Poitou &s;ecured with &s;trong garri&s;ons; but the king &s;till found his elde&s;t &s;on &s;ullen, and aver&s;e to a hearty reconciliation. He &s;eemed to doubt his father's &s;incerity; and re|fu&s;ed to obey when he was &s;ummoned to court: perhaps his father-in-law en|couraged<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1175.</NOTE> and infu&s;ed the&s;e &s;u&s;picions. Con&s;cious of his own ingratitude and mi&s;conduct, he could not believe him&s;elf heartily forgiven, and gave out that there was an intention to confine him to clo&s;e pri&s;on. He would not relea&s;e the pri&s;oners he had taken, without ran&s;om; and plainly demon&s;trated, both by his words and actions, that he wanted nothing but power to renew the rebellion. Henry was &s;hocked at his unnatural di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;ent &s;everal me&s;&s;ages to convince him of his paternal tenderne&s;s. At length he &s;eemed to be &s;atisfied, and coming to Bures, fell upon his knees, imploring the king's forgivene&s;s. He was joyfully received; took the oath of allegiance, at his own earne&s;t reque&s;t; was allowed to make a &s;hort vi&s;it to the court of France, and, at his return, accompanied his father to England. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Duet.

<P>At We&s;tmin&s;ter they found Richard, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, pre&s;iding in a &s;ynod, which enacted &s;everal canons for facilitating and inforcing the payment of tythes$ reforming the morals and habit of the clergy, and regu|lating pre&s;entations, rites and ceremonies. In this a&s;&s;embly, the king's letter, notifying his reconciliation with young Henry, was read in pre&s;ence of that prince, who took the oaths of homage and allegiance, and publicly renounced all a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the king of France and his brothers, the prelates and monks of England, Normandy, and Guienne, provided he &s;hould ever deviate for the future from his filial obedience. Upon this occa&s;ion, the di&s;pute was renewed between the archbi&s;hops of Canterbury and York touching the privileges of the two fees. Richard had obtained the primacy of all England, and a lega|tine power within his own province. Roger of York was ve&s;ted with the &s;ame authority over Scotland, and pretended to the right of carrying his cro&s;s erect within the juri&s;diction of Canterbury. They envied and took all occa&s;ions of mortifying each other. Richard excommunicated the clergy of a chapel be|longing to the province of York, for contempt of his orders. He &s;u&s;pended the dean of Waltham; and appointed an abbe&s;s at W nche&s;ter in &s;pite of the nuns, who had the right of election. The archbi&s;hop of York appealed to the pope, from &s;ome of his cen&s;ures and claims. Cardinal Hugozun was &s;ent over to ter|minate the&s;e di&s;putes. Richard was fain to retract his cen&s;ures, and re&s;ign his preten&s;ions. Godfrey, bi&s;hop of St. A&s;aph, relinqui&s;hed his &s;ee, becau&s;e it<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr. J. Abb. Petriburg.</NOTE> was not worth keeping. That of Norwich, and twelve abbeys being now al&s;o vacant, the king i&s;&s;ued writs, requiring the chapters and convents to &s;end depu|tations to Oxford at a certain day, to fill up tho&s;e vac$ncies, and in the mean time he vi&s;ited the marches of Wales.</P>

of the marches in a mutual oath, to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other in ca&s;e they &s;hould be at|tacked by the Wel&s;h, who did not own his royal authority. From hence Henry repaired to Wode&s;toke, where he held his court: the delegates of Nor|wich cho&s;e John de Oxford for their bi&s;hop; the vacant abbeys were &s;upplied, and the election of Geoffrey, the king's natural &s;on, to the &s;ee of Lincoln was confirmed. The king, at this juncture, &s;eems to have &s;u&s;pected a con&s;piracy again&s;t his life; for he publi&s;hed a proclamation, forbidding all per&s;ons to enter his court without permi&s;&s;ion, and tho&s;e who belonged to it, or came upon leave or &s;ummons, to remain after &s;un-&s;et, or approach it before &s;un-ri&s;e. Another ordinance was publi&s;hed at the &s;ame time, to prevent people from carrying bows, arrows, or pointed daggers, on the Engli&s;h &s;ide of the Severne.

<P>The peace with Scotland being firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, Henry returned to Wind&s;or, where he convoked a council, to deliberate upon the affairs of Ire|land, which were re-involved in confu&s;ion. Richard Strongbow, Robert Fitz|&s;tephens, and &s;ome others of the fir&s;t adventurers, had been called over to a&s;&s;i&s;t the king, and done &s;ignal &s;ervice both in England and Normandy. In their ab&s;ence, the Iri&s;h, provoked by the depredations of the &s;oldiers left under the command of Harvey de Montmorency, and encouraged by the weakne&s;s and dimini&s;hed number of their oppre&s;&s;ors, revolted in many places; &s;o that the whole country was thrown in confu&s;ion. Henry having triumphed over his enemies, &s;ent Richard back to Ireland, with the title of guardian, and a grant of Wexford and Wicklow, as a recompence for his &s;ervices. Raymond le Gros was, at his own de&s;ire, joined with him in the commi&s;&s;ion; and this colleague had no &s;ooner taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his po&s;t, than he made an incur&s;ion into the country of O Phelan, from whence he carried off a great boo$y. This was con|veyed by &s;ea to Waterford in a fleet of &s;hips, which, in their voyage, obtained a compleat victory over an armament equipped by the Ea&s;terlings of Corke. He him&s;elf marched by land with the re&s;t of the plunder, amounting to four thou&s;and head of cattle, and defeated Dermot Maccarty, prince of De&s;mond, in an engagement near Li&s;more. After the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es, he was, by the death of his father William Fitzgerald, obliged to cro&s;s the &s;ea into Wales; and at his departure, the command reverted to Harvey de Montmorency. This officer
<PB N="355" REF="3640">
prevailed upon Strongbow to undertake an expedition into the country of Lime|rick; but a reinforcement of four hundred Ea&s;terlings, recruited at Dublin for that &s;ervice, were, in their march to join him, &s;urpri&s;ed and cut in pieces by Donald Obryen, prince of Thomond; &s;o that the earl was forced to retire, in all ha&s;te, to Waterford, where he was in a manner be&s;ieged.</P>

<P>The Iri&s;h, elevated with this advantage, ran to arms in all quarters: Roderic, king of Connaught, pa&s;&s;ing the Shannon at the head of a numerous army, ravaged the country of Meath; while the Engli&s;h, abandoning the &s;mall garri&s;ons of Trim and Dulcke, retired to Dublin, without daring to face the natives in the field. Richard, alarmed at the&s;e proceedings, wrote a letter to Raymond, to whom he promi&s;ed his &s;i&s;ter in marriage, if he would return im|mediately with all the &s;uccours he could rai&s;e. The propo&s;al was embraced, and Raymond embarking with thirty knights, one hundred hor&s;e, and thrice the number of Wel&s;h archers, arrived at Waterford, from whence he accompanied the earl to Wexford, where his marriage with the fair Ba&s;ilea was con&s;ummated. Then he marched into Meath, compelled Roderic to retire, and repaired the ca&s;tles which had been di&s;mantled. The king of Connaught, dreading a vi&s;it from this enterprizing commander, in his own territories, &s;ent the archbi&s;hop of Tuam, and two other clergymen, as amba&s;&s;adors to the Engli&s;h monarch, to &s;ue for peace and renew his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. To the&s;e Henry granted an audience at Wind&s;or, where a treaty was effected, on condition that Roderic &s;hould own the king of England as his liege and &s;overeign, and pay every tenth hide of the cattle within his dominions; and that all his Iri&s;h &s;ubjects, holding under Roderic, &s;hould, on payment of the &s;ame tribute, be confirmed in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. Roderic<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hibern. Expug$. Bened. Abb.</NOTE> was, by virtue of this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, &s;ecured from the attacks of Raymond, who marched again&s;t Donald, prince of Thomond, pa&s;&s;ed the Shannon in the face of the enemy, and reduced Limerick by a&s;&s;ault. The fame of his exploits excited the envy of Montmorency, who in&s;inuated to the king, that Raymond har|boured a de&s;ign of conquering the kingdom for him&s;elf; and Henry, who was never deaf to &s;ugge&s;tions of this nature, &s;ent over four commi&s;&s;ioners, two of whom were ordered to return immediately with Raymond, and the others directed to remain in Ireland, and watch the conduct of Strongbow. The&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners having arrived in Ireland, and &s;ignified their orders, Raymond be|gan to prepare for his departure, and was ju&s;t ready to embark, when Richard received advice that Donald, prince of Thomond, had inve&s;ted Limerick; and that the garri&s;on, being very ill provided, &s;tood in need of immediate relief. Richard would have begun his march without lo&s;s of time; but the troops re|fu&s;ed to &s;erve under any other commander but Raymond, who, with the leave of the commi&s;&s;ioners, undertook the expedition. In his route he was joined by a body of Iri&s;h, under Murchard and Donald, kings of Kilkenny and O&s;&s;ory, while the prince of Thomond, being appri&s;ed of his motions, rai&s;ed the &s;iege, and advanced to meet him at a narrow pa&s;s, which he fortified with trees and trenches. Raymond forced his way through the&s;e difficulties at the fir&s;t on&s;et, routed the enemy, and entered Limerick in triumph. The princes of Con|naught and Thomond &s;ubmitted to the victor, &s;wore allegiance to king Henry, and gave ho&s;tages for their fidelity. Then Raymond marched to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Dermot Maccarty, prince of De&s;mond, who was in danger of being depo&s;ed by his own &s;on Cormac O Lechan: the Engli&s;h general advancing towards Corke,

<P>Richard Strongbow, earl of Pembroke, had been dangerou&s;ly ill for &s;ome time, and now dying at Dublin, without male i&s;&s;ue, his daughter I&s;a|bel became heire&s;s of all his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Lein&s;ter. His &s;i&s;ter Ba&s;ilea carefully concealed his death, until &s;he could &s;end advice of it to her hu&s;band Raymond, who finding it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to repair to Dublin, to a&s;&s;ume the reins of government, and draw thither the greate&s;t part of the forces, in ca&s;e an in&s;urrec|tion &s;hould en&s;ue, had no other chance for pre&s;erving Limerick, but that of leaving it in the hands of Donald, prince of Thomond, as a va&s;&s;al of the Eng|li&s;h crown, from whom, however, he exacted ho&s;tages, and a new oath to de|fend the place, and re&s;tore it to the king upon demand. In&s;tead of regarding this obligation, however, Raymond had &s;carce pa&s;&s;ed over the bridge, when the other part of it was broken down, and the city fired in four different places. The commi&s;&s;ioners, in con&s;equence of Richard's death, returned to England, to make the king acquainted with the alteration of affairs. Henry appointed William Fitzaldhelm and John de Courcy procurators, or ju&s;tices of Ireland, and they were accompanied by Robert Fitz&s;tephens and Miles Cogan. Fitz|aldhelm being the fir&s;t in commi&s;&s;ion, and &s;ene&s;chal, Raymond, at his arrival in Wexford, &s;urrendered to him the government, cities, forts, and garri&s;ons of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, Henry's attention was chiefly employed in regulating the civil policy of England. He &s;ummoned a great council at Northampton, where the con&s;titutions of Clarendon, with regard to laymen and criminal matters, were amended and confirmed; and &s;ome of the old Saxon laws revived: further mea&s;ures were taken to prevent murder, robbery, clipping and coining, and to puni&s;h incendiaries$ and harbourers of convicted criminals; it was decreed that they &s;hould lo&s;e the right hand as well as the foot; and that ru&s;tics &s;hould not e&s;cape, though acquitted by the water ordeal, but be bani&s;hed the king|dom, notwith&s;tanding this trial, provided they were reputed guilty in the opinion of the neighbourhood. That ju&s;tice might be duly admini&s;tered, the realm was di|vided into &s;ix circuits, and to each of the&s;e three ju&s;tices were a&s;&s;igned; that they might make a yearly progre&s;s, and determine pleas of the crown and civil cau&s;es. They were upon this occa&s;ion enjoined to enquire into all di&s;&s;ei&s;ins, &s;ince the king's la&s;t return to England; to admini&s;ter the oath of fealty to all noblemen, knights, freeholders, and hu&s;bandmen; to pro&s;ecute to an outlawry<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bened.

<P>To this council of Northampton the king of Scotland was &s;um|moned, with &s;everal abbots of that kingdom, to acknowledge their &s;ubjection to the Engli&s;h church; but this they refu&s;ed to profe&s;s, and a&s;&s;erted their own in|dependence. Roger, archb$&s;hop of York, produced in&s;tances of &s;uch &s;ubjec|tion to his &s;ee, payed of old by the bi&s;hops of Withorne and Gla&s;gow, and bulls of divers popes, e&s;tabli&s;hing and confirming the primacy of York over all the &s;ees of Scotland: but he was warmly oppo&s;ed by the archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury, who in&s;i&s;ted upon their being &s;ubject to his church, though he could ad|vance no plau&s;ible argument to &s;trengthen his claim; and Henry put an end to
<PB N="357" REF="3660">
the di&s;pute, by allowing the Scotti&s;h prelates to return to their own country, without having acknowleged the primacy of either. Another quarrel was re|vived between the two metropolitans, in their conte&s;t for precedency, which Richard claimed as the undoubted right of his church, by an antient and invariable cu&s;tom; while Roger pretended to it, from the priority of his con&s;ecration, according to a con&s;titution of Gregory the great. At a &s;ynod held in the chapel of St. Catherine, in We&s;tmin$ter, by Huguezun, the pope's legate, Roger, entering the place before his rival, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;eat on the cardinal's right-hand; but Richard coming, refu&s;ed to &s;it on the left-hand. The mo&s;t virulent altercation en&s;ued, though the king was pre&s;ent; and the &s;uf|fragans of Canterbury proceeding to immediate action, Roger was pulled from his place, thrown down, trampled under foot, and treated with other indigni|ties. Huguezun was &s;candali&s;ed at this violence and indecency, in con&s;equence of which the &s;ynod immediately broke up, and, &s;uppo&s;ing the outrage to have been preconcerted by the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury and his dependants, &s;um|moned him to an&s;wer for it before the pope, to whom Roger al&s;o appealed. But Richard with a &s;um of money appea&s;ed the legate; and the king called another council at Winche&s;ter to compromi&s;e the difference between the two prelates, who agreed to refer the di&s;pute to the arbitration of the archbi&s;hop of Rouen, and &s;ome other foreign prelates, and to wait five years for their deci&s;ion. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bened.

<P>Henry's eccle&s;ia&s;tical troubles were no &s;ooner pacified, than his do|me&s;tic di&s;gu&s;ts revived. His elde&s;t &s;on &s;till retained his jealou&s;y and aver&s;ion to his father's government; and this was fomented by the para&s;ites, who had in&s;inuated them&s;elves into his confidence. He could not re&s;ide with any plea&s;ure in Eng|land; and therefore, on pretence of devotion, de&s;ired to make a pilgrimage to James of Compo&s;tella: the old king endeavoured to divert him from his pur|po&s;e; but, finding him inflexible, granted the permi&s;&s;ion he de&s;ired, and he was already at Port&s;mouth, waiting for a fair wind, when his brother Richard arrived from the continent, to &s;ollicit &s;uccours for maintaining war with the ba|rons of Guienne, who refu&s;ed to part with their ca&s;tles, according to Henry's orders. The king immediately &s;ent for his elde&s;t &s;on to Winche&s;ter, where he per&s;uaded him to po&s;tpone his pilgrimage, and a&s;&s;i&s;t his brother in the reduction of Guienne, towards which he &s;upplied Richard with a large &s;um of money.

This young prince levying a &s;trong body of forces in Guienne, defeated the Brabantines in a pitched battle, between S. Megrin and Bouteville; then advancing into the Limou&s;in, reduced the ca&s;tle of Aixe, and the city of Limoges, and returned to Poitiers, to hold a council with his bro|ther Henry, about the further operations of the campaign.</P>

<P>The two brothers undertook the &s;iege of Chateauneuf, but Henry, after having &s;tayed about a fortnight in the camp, returned to Poitiers, and took into his family and &s;ervice a number of French and Norman knights, who had been the profe&s;&s;ed enemies of his father. The&s;e nece&s;&s;arily in&s;tigated him to renounce his duty and allegiance by another revolt; and one Adam de Cher|chedun, his chancellor, wrote an account of their conduct to be forwarded to the king; but his letters being intercepted, young Henry would have put him to death, had not he claimed the privilege of an eccle&s;ia&s;tic, which was a&s;&s;ert|ed by the bi&s;hop of Poitiers. This, however, could not &s;creen him from the

mo&s;t painful and ignominious puni&s;hment. He was ordered to be &s;tripped $tark naked, with his hands tied behind him, and &s;courged through the &s;treets of Poitiers: he underwent the &s;ame &s;hameful di&s;cipline in all the towns, through which he pa&s;&s;ed in his way to Argenton, where he was kept in clo&s;e pri&s;on, un|til the king, hearing of his misfortune, &s;ent four knights of his hou&s;hold, to bring him &s;afe into England.

The &s;iege was carried on with &s;uch vigour, that in &s;ix days they were fain to capitulate, and &s;urrender at di&s;cretion; and Richard &s;ent them over to his father, who remitted them to his cu&s;tody, until he him&s;elf &s;hould cro&s;s the &s;ea into Normandy.</P>

He took into his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion all the ca&s;tles belonging to his barons, and committed them to the care of his own<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoveden. Be$e$ict.</NOTE> warders. He gave his daughter Eleanor in marriage to Alphon&s;o, king of Ca&s;tile, and be&s;towed the other, who&s;e name was Jane, upon William, king of Sicily, to whom cardinal Huguezun had made a very advantageous report of her beauty and merit. This legate came over into England, to ab&s;olve Henry of the vow he had taken to go on a p$lgrimage to the Holy Land; and he was ordered by the pope to exerci&s;e his legatine power in a vi&s;itation of the churches in England, and by in&s;i&s;ting upon the execution of the &s;tipulations made at Henry's ab&s;olution, after the mur$er of Becket. The king had con&s;ented that no clergyman &s;hould be called to an&s;wer before a lay judge, for any crime or tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, except tho&s;e of the fore&s;t laws, and in ca&s;e of lay fees which owed &s;ervice to the &s;ove|reign or lord paramount: he had promi&s;ed, that no prelacy &s;hould be kept va|cant longer than one year; and exempted the clergy from the hard&s;hip of de|ciding their right by duel; a privilege which he had already granted to the laity, by the in&s;titution of the grand a&s;&s;ize. Hitherto the murderers of clergy|men were only puni&s;hed with excommunication; but now the king enacted a law, ordaining that the murderers of eccle&s;ia&s;t$cs &s;hould be tried in his court, before the ju&s;tic ary of the realm, in pre&s;ence of the bi&s;hop of the dioce&s;e or his official; and be&s;ides the u&s;ual puni&s;hment incurred by tho&s;e convicted of murder|ing laymen, forfeit for them&s;elves and their heirs, all their real e&s;tates and lands<NOTE PLACE="marg">D$$to.

In return for the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions in behalf of the clergy, the pope gave up the pretended exemption, in&s;i&s;ted upon by Becket when he refu&s;ed to plead in the king's court; and in a bull dated at Fra&s;cati, expre&s;ly declared, that all cau&s;es about e&s;tates and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions belonged to the cognizance of the royal tribunal.</P>

a licence, and hinder his proceeding, until he &s;hould promi&s;e, upon oath, to take no &s;tep to the prejudice of the Engli&s;h church.

<P>The next mea&s;ure of importance pur&s;ued by Henry, was an in|qui&s;ition into divided fiefs, their tenures in capite and &s;ervices; which was made by all the &s;heriffs and bailiffs of the kingdom, and the report delivered into the exchequer. He then i&s;&s;ued orders to all the earls, barons, and knights of the realm who held of him in capite, to meet him at London, with their hor&s;es and arms, in order to be tran&s;ported into Normandy, where they &s;hould &s;erve a whole year at their own expence. In all probability, he fore&s;aw a rupture with France; but, this not happening &s;o &s;oon as he expected, the rendezvous was po&s;tponed. In the interim Alphon&s;o, king of Ca&s;t$le, and his uncle Sanchez,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Be$ed.

The king a&s;&s;embled all his prelates, earls, and barons at London, to examine the merits of this extraordinary appeal; and the facts being fairly &s;tated on both &s;ides, he awarded to each party the territories which the other had u&s;urped; and the determination being approved by both kings, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the amba&s;&s;adors with magnificent pre&s;ents. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Brompton.</NOTE></P>

<P>By this time the mutual jealou&s;y and di&s;gu&s;t, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the kings of England and France, drew towards a rupture. Henry had &s;marted &s;o &s;everely by matching his elde&s;t &s;on in the family of Lewis, that he had no in|clination to fulfil the contract of marriage between Richard and the French king's daughter Alice, which had been &s;ettled at the pacification. He had a very good pretext for po&s;tponing this alliance, becau&s;e Lewis had not fulfilled his part of the agreement, in ceding the Vexin to young Henry, and the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bened.

The old king re&s;olved to avail him&s;elf of this handle; and delaying the rendezvous of his troops by a proclamation, &s;ent the archbi&s;hop of Rouen, with the bi&s;hops of Winche&s;ter and Ely, as his am|ba&s;&s;adors to the court of France, to demand the execution of the articles; and that his daughter-in-law Margaret, who had gone thither without his know|lege and con&s;ent, &s;hould be re-conducted to Normandy, as her pregnancy was then far advanced. To the&s;e demands no &s;atisfactory an&s;wer was returned; and all the affairs of the kingdom being &s;ettled in an a&s;&s;embly at Winche&s;ter, at which William, king of Scotland, a&s;&s;i&s;ted, in obedience to a royal mandate, Henry repaired to Stoke, in the neighbourhood of Port&s;mouth, where his fleet lay ready for the embarkation of his forces. There he was detained by contrary winds, until a me&s;&s;enger arrived with advice from Richard Giffard, whom he employed as an agent in France, that cardinal Peter, elect of Meaux, and le|gate in that kingdom, had received orders to lay his dominions under an inter|dict, unle&s;s he would immediately con&s;ent to the con&s;ummation of the marriage between Richard and Alice. He returned immediately to Winche&s;ter, where he con&s;ulted his prelates and friends upon this &s;ubject; and the archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury, with his &s;uffragans, appealed to the pope again&s;t this intended &s;entence of the legate; while a me&s;&s;enger was di&s;patched to the archbi&s;hop of York, de&s;iring he would take the &s;ame &s;tep in his province, without delay. Thus &s;e|cured again&s;t the bad effects of the papal cen&s;ure, he embarked at Port&s;mouth, with his &s;on Geoffrey, and landed next day in Normandy, from whence the young prince &s;et out immediately for Bretagne, to quell &s;ome di&s;turbances in that

province; while his father repaired to Rouen, where he was vi&s;ited by cardinal Peter. This prelate, having &s;ignified the orders of his holine&s;s, propo&s;ed an in|terview between Henry and the French king, who met accordingly at Gu&eacute; S.

Then he re&s;cued a rich heire&s;s, the daughter of Ralf de Deols, who had been carried off by the lord of La Cha&s;tre, and quelled an in&s;urrection in the Li|mou&s;in. Thence he repaired to Grei&s;&s;ac, in Auvergne, when, in the pre&s;ence of the French king, the a&s;&s;embled &s;tates of that province declared, that their country belonged of ancient right to the counts of Guienne, except the bi&s;hop|ric of Clermont, which was under the patronage of France. Lewis di&s;&s;enting from this verdict, the di&s;pute was left to the arbitration of twelve referees; and in the mean time, Henry took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ca&s;tle of Turenne, and received homage and allegiance from the barons and knights of La Marche, which he purcha&s;ed for &s;ix thou&s;and marks of &s;ilver, of count Audibert, who had engaged in an expedition to the Holy Land. His next care was to provide for the &s;ecurity of his Norman frontiers, towards which he procured letters of protection from the French king, according to the practice of tho&s;e times, in which mutual a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of this kind was never refu&s;ed by princes who had taken the cro&s;s to|gether. <NOTE PLACE="marg">R. de Monte.</NOTE></P>

Young Henry was &s;o fond of &s;uch atchievements, that they engro&s;&s;ed his whole attention for three years, during which he con&s;orted with knights only, and courted po|pularity, at a prodigous expence. Richard was more honourably engaged in oppo&s;ing the ravages of the banditti, compo&s;ed of Ba&s;ques, Navarrois, and other mounta$eers inhabiting the Pyrenees, who infe&s;ted Guienne, and occa|&s;ionally joined the barons when they revolted.

Thus &s;atisfied, he and his brothers accompanied their father to Angers, were they &s;wore to maintain perpetual amity with one another; and Geoffrey, having now obtained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Brittany by his mar|riage with Con&s;$ance, did homag&eacute; to his elder brother for that dutchy: but when the father propo&s;ed the like &s;ubmi&s;&s;on for Guienne, Richard at fir&s;t re|fu&s;ed to comply with his de&s;ire: he was at length, however, prevailed upon to offer homage to young Henry, by whom it was rejected with di&s;dain. High words en&s;ued, and this was the beginning of a quarrel, in con&s;equence of which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1183.</NOTE> Richard retired to his province and fortified his ca&s;tles. As he had ruled with great &s;everity, and debauched the wives and daughters of his barons, they now engaged in a con&s;piracy again&s;t him, and offered their allegiance to Henry, who countenanced their revolt, and, in conjunction with his brother Geoffrey, re&s;olved to drive Richard out of Guienne. With this view, Henry inve&s;ted it on one &s;ide, and Geoffrey on the other, while the barons appeared in open re|bellion. In this emergency, Richard had recour&s;e to his father, who forthwith rai&s;ed a numerous army, and marched to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He entered the town of Limoges, though the ca&s;tle was in the hands of his elde&s;t &s;on, who, finding it would be impracticable to cope with his father in the field, pretended to &s;ubmit and reconcile the barons of Guienne with his brother Richard: under pretence of effecting this accommodation, he and Geoffrey held private conferences with tho$e revolters, in which they concerted mea&s;ures for the king's de&s;truction. He was &s;o little apprehen&s;ive of their de&s;ign, that he had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t part of his forces; and while he &s;taid at Limoges in full &s;ecurity, the &s;oldiers in the ca&s;tle tutored for the purpo&s;e, &s;ent a flight of arrows again&s;t him, one day while he took the a$r on hor&s;eback, &s;u&s;pecting no danger.

<P>Young Henry, thus baffled in his $erfidious &s;cheme, took the cro&s;s, and in&s;i&s;ted upon going to the Holy Land; and the king con&s;ented to the expedition, a&s;&s;uring him, that his equipage &s;hould &s;urpa&s;s in magnificence, that of any prince who had embarked in &s;uch an enterprize. But, before he could execute his re&s;olution, he was taken ill of a fever at Martel, a ca&s;tle in Turenne, and apprehending that his life was near a period, earne&s;tly de&s;ired to &s;peak with his father. The king, &s;u&s;pecting &s;ome treachery$ &s;ent a bi&s;hop, who found him in extremity, and received his dying reque&s;t, that his father would forgive all his offences and ingratitude; pay the wages due to his knights and attendants, and deal mercifully with the barons of Guienne.

<P>This lady was like to occa&s;ion another rupture with France: for king Henry had &s;carce returned to Normandy, when her brother Philip de|manded<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1184.</NOTE> her jointure, and Gi&s;ors, with all its dependencies, which had been given with her in marriage. Henry alledged, that the &s;ettlement was void, as a&s;&s;igning lands which belonged to queen Eleanor, whom he now relea&s;ed; and he claimed Gi&s;ors as an appendage of Normandy. This di&s;pute produced a long negociation, which at length ended in an accommodation at Gi&s;ors, where both kings agreed, that Margaret &s;hould relinqui&s;h her claim to the dower, in con&s;ideration of an annuity amounting to two thou&s;and &s;even hundred livres; and that Gi&s;ors &s;hould be given to either of Henry's &s;ons, as the portion of Adelais or Alice, who had been de&s;igned for Richard, and educated at Win|che&s;ter. After this accommodation, Henry returned to England, where he was vi&s;ited by William, king of Scotland, who demanded in marriage Maud, the daughter of the duke of Saxony; and the propo&s;al was accepted, though the marriage did not take place, becau&s;e the parties were related within the prohi|bited degrees of con&s;anguinity, and the pope's di&s;pen&s;ation could not be ob|tained.

<P>At the death of young Henry, Richard &s;ucceeding as heir appa|rent to the throne, was de&s;ired by his father to re&s;ign Guienne to his younge&s;t brother John, who had been brought to Normandy for this purpo&s;e; but Rich|ard de&s;iring time to con&s;ult his friends, withdrew privately into his province, from whence he wrote a letter to his father, refu&s;ing to part with his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. When the king returned to England, Geo$$rey and John invaded Guienne, ravag|ing the country as they proceeded; and Richard, in revenge, made incur&s;ions into Brittany: till at length their father commanded them to &s;u&s;pend their ho&s;tili|ties, and come over to England, when they were reconciled, and Richard &s;ub|mitted to his determination. About this period the archbi&s;hop of Cologne ar|riving in this kingdom, on a pilgrimage to Becket's tomb, propo&s;ed a match between Richard and the emperor's daughter, which was actually &s;ettled, tho' rendered afterwards ineffectual by the death of that prince&s;s; and Henry &s;eized this opportunity of compromi&s;ing the difference between his &s;on-in-law the duke of Saxony, and this prelate, who not only forgave him for the injuries he had received at his hands, but al&s;o undertook to be his advocate with Fre|derick; at the &s;ame time he engaged in his behalf pope Lucius, whom he had

<P>The next affair that engaged the king's attention, was the va|cancy of the metropolitan &s;ee, by the death of archbi&s;hop Richard. Ralf de Glanville, the chief ju&s;ticiary, and &s;ome bi&s;hops, were &s;ent to prepare the convent for an election; and the monks pitched upon the abbot of Battel, and four other eccle&s;ia&s;tics, who were rejected by the king, at a council held at Reading. A di&s;pute en&s;ued, between the delegates of the convent and the &s;uf|fragan bi&s;hops, about the right of electing, and divers councils were convened before the matter could be brought to a determination. At length the bi&s;hops cho&s;e Baldwin, of Worce&s;ter, who was confirmed by the king; but, as the monks retired without giving their a&s;&s;ent, Henry went in per&s;on to Canterbury, and per&s;uaded them to acquie&s;ce in the choice, after they had been indulged with the formality of another election. In con&s;equence of this permi&s;&s;ion, the delegates a&s;&s;embling in the chapter-hou&s;e at We&s;tmin&s;ter, cho&s;e Baldwin, &s;ang Te Deum, led him to the altar, &s;aluted him on the cheek, and pre&s;ented him to the king and his &s;ons, who repeated the &s;alutation of the ki&s;s, which he had received at his fir&s;t election. Hitherto the fore&s;t laws had been very much neg|lected, through the indulgence of the king; but the &s;ubject abu&s;ed his lenity to &s;uch a degree, that in each department of the kingdom, he appointed two gen|tlemen of his hou&s;hold, as verdurers, with full authority over all his fore&s;ters, and tho&s;e belonging to his knights and barons. There was a new a&s;&s;ize of the fore&s;t, e&s;tabli&s;hed, cautioning all per&s;ons again&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the fore&s;t laws of Henry I. which he was determined thenceforward to put in execution; though he allowed his earls, barons, and free tenants, to cut wood for their own u&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr.

<P>Henry, while at peace with his neighbours, was generally employed in mea&s;ures for the advantage of his &s;ubjects, or of his own family; and no prince was more ungratefully treated by both. His younge&s;t &s;on John, having now attained the age of manhood, was knighted by him at Wind&s;or, in order to be &s;ent into Ireland, that he might make an entire conque&s;t, and enjoy the crown of that kingdom. The Iri&s;h affairs had been hitherto left chiefly to the ma|nagement of private adventurers, who, being di&s;united among them&s;elves, had not made &s;uch progre&s;s as he expected from their valour: they &s;eemed to aim rather at independent &s;ettlements, than at a national advantage. There was a &s;ort of jealou&s;y between the king's officers and the private proprietors of the con|quered lands, which much retarded the conque&s;t of the country; for their mutual jars and indifference towards one another, occa&s;ioned a relaxation of di&s;cipline, and a want of that punctual exertion of authority, which was nece&s;&s;ary to repre&s;s the incon&s;tant di&s;po&s;ition of the Iri&s;h. William Fitz-a$dhelm, appointed lord ju&s;tice, had employed him&s;elf in nothing but &s;chemes for curtailing the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of private adventurers, for his own ad|vantage: Miles Cogan, governor of Dublin, had made a &s;hort expedition into Connaught, but was obliged to retreat with precipitation, after having lo&s;t &s;e|veral
<PB N="368" REF="3770">
men in an ambu&s;cade near the Shannon. Philip de Braou&s;e remained in|active in Limerick: Robert Fitz&s;tephens and Miles Cogan planted &s;even can|treds near the city of Corke; and left the other twenty-four in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Der|mot Maccarty, prince of De&s;mond: but a quarrel happening on account of the death of Miles, and Ralf the &s;on of Robert, who were treacherou&s;ly mur|dered by Mactyre, Dermot a&s;&s;embled an army, and inve&s;ted Corke, which was bravely defended by Robert, until his nephew Raimund arrived with &s;ome troops from Wales, and rai&s;ed the &s;iege. This reinforcement, and another, under the command of Philip Barry and Richard, brother to Miles Cogan, enabled Robert to defeat the Iri&s;h in &s;everal encounters, until that part of the country was reduced to obedience. Hugh de Lacy &s;ettled colonies throughout the whole country of Meath, and bui$t a number of ca&s;tles for their protection: he re&s;tored tho&s;e who had been violently ejected from their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and governed with &s;uch equity and re&s;olution, that the people became happy under his admini&s;tra|tion; and, laying a&s;ide their barbaro$s cu&s;toms, began to live together in towns and villages. He &s;ucceeded Fitz-aldhelm, who was reca$led, as &s;ole guardian of the kingdom, and &s;ettled Lein&s;ter, as he had before cultivated Meath; en|couraging the arts of peace, and conciliating the affection of the Iri&s;h by his ge|nero&s;ity, affability, and equ$table government. At length he became extremely popular, and marrying the daughter of Roderic O Connor, king of Connaught, king Henry was &s;o alarmed at the alliance, that he &s;ent over John, con&s;table of Che&s;ter, and Richard de Pec, to a&s;&s;ume the admini&s;tration, and keep a watch|ful eye over Hugh's conduct: but perceiving he had nothing in view but the public good, they returned to England, and made &s;uch favourable report of his integrity, that he was re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in the government, and Robert de Shrew&s;bury joined with him in the commi&s;&s;ion. During the&s;e tran&s;actions, no attempt was made to extend the Engli&s;h conque&s;t, but by John de Courcy, a nobleman of gigantic &s;tature, great &s;trength, and the mo&s;t enterpri&s;ing courage, to whom Henry had granted a patent for all the lands he &s;hould conquer in the un&s;ubdued parts of Ireland, joining him at the &s;ame time with Fitz aldhelm in the government. John, leaving the civil power with his colleague, b$gan his march into the province of Ul&s;ter, with two and twenty knights and follow|ers, and three hundred private &s;oldiers. On the fourth day of his march he ar|rived at Downe, in which re&s;ided king Dunleve, who f$$d at his approach, &s;o that he took the town without re&s;i&s;tance. The legate Viv$an, who at that time held a council in the town, endeavoured to mediate a peace between John and Dunleve, which la&s;t promi&s;ed to pay a trib$te, if the other would $$ave the country; but his propo&s;al being rejected, he re&s;olved to hazard a battle, and, a&s;&s;embling a body of ten thou&s;and men, advanced to Downe, where De Cour$y lay encamped. The engagement was bloody and &s;evere, and the victory conti|nued long doubtful: but at length the half naked Iri&s;h, yielding to the arms and &s;uperior di&s;cip$ine of the Engli&s;h, were utterly defeated. Nevert$ele&s;s they afterwards returned with a &s;tronger army, and were routed in ano|ther battle; after which the victor erected two ca&s;tles, for the &s;ecurity of his conque&s;t, at Ferney, in the county of Monag$an. The&s;e he committed to the care of Macmahon, the chieftain of a &s;$pt who had &s;ubmitted and &s;worn fidelity; and Courcy's back was no &s;ooner turned, than he levelled them with the ground. John, incen&s;ed at this in&s;tance of perfidy, ravaged
<PB N="369" REF="3780">
his territories, and drove away his cattle, to an incredible number, in three di|vi&s;ions, taking up as many miles in length. In pa&s;&s;ing thro' deep roads, &s;urround|ed with bogs and woods, the Iri&s;h, who had concealed them&s;elves in ambu&s;h, ru&s;hed &s;uddenly from the bu&s;hes, with &s;uch hideous &s;houts as affrighted the cattle, which turned upon their drivers, and occa&s;ioned univer&s;al di&s;order among the Engli&s;h, who were di&s;per&s;ed and mo&s;tly cut in pieces. John de Courcy him&s;elf was obliged, with a few followers, to fight his way with incredible va|lour for two days together, until he reached a fort, which &s;erved as a rendez|vous for his &s;cattered party. This was immediately inve&s;ted by the enemy, who elated with their &s;ucce&s;s, encamped in a carele&s;s manner, without watches, guards, or patroles; and John, apprized of their ra&s;h &s;ecurity, &s;allied upon them in the night, when they were half a&s;leep; &s;o that making no re&s;i&s;tance, &s;uch a carnage en&s;ued, that not above two hundred of their whole number e&s;caped. They ventured two other battles, and were defeated in both, fir&s;t at Dundalk, and afterwards near the bridge of Ivory: then John married the daughter of Go|thred, king of Man and the i&s;les; and this alliance depriving the enemy of all hope of &s;uccour from that quarter, he, in a little time, completed the conque&s;t of Ul&s;ter. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hibern.

<P>King Henry hoping the pre&s;ence of his &s;on John would unite the Eng|li&s;h intere&s;t, and ha&s;ten the reduction of the country, &s;upplied him with four hundred knights, twice the number of hor&s;emen, and a &s;trong body of archers, with whom he began his march to Milford-haven, and there embarking arrived next day at Waterford. Immediately after his landing, he was vi&s;ited by the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the Iri&s;h nobility re&s;iding in tho&s;e parts, who had lived peaceably under the Engli&s;h government; but, in&s;tead of being graciou&s;ly re|ceived, they met with the mo&s;t indecent in&s;ults and deri&s;ion from his giddy fa|vourites, who laughed at their habit and addre&s;s, &s;hook them by their long beards, and committed other &s;uch outrages, that the natives, who were remark|ably proud and impatient, retired in the utmo&s;t indignation to their own homes, from whence they removed their families and cattle into the territories of Lime|rick, Corke, and Connaught. The report they made of the in&s;olence with which they had been treated, by the &s;tripling prince and his Norman compa|nions, had &s;uch an effect upon the princes of the&s;e dominions, that although they had re&s;olved to &s;ubmit, they now renounced all thoughts of &s;ubjection to the Engli&s;h government. In&s;tead of going to offer their &s;ervices and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to John, the petty princes hitherto at variance engaged in a league for their common defence, and the refugees &s;erved them as &s;pies and guides to the Eng|li&s;h quarters, into which they made repeated incur&s;ions. At the arrival of the fir&s;t adventurers, the Iri&s;h had no defen&s;ive armour, and u&s;ed no other wea|pons than &s;hort lances, &s;lender darts, and hatchets, managed with one hand: &s;o that they could not &s;tand the &s;hock of heavy armed troops, under|&s;tood nothing of hor&s;e &s;ervice, and dreaded the arrows, which wounded their na|ked bodies at a di&s;tance. But, by this time, they had profited by their expe|rience;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1185.</NOTE> they had procured &s;ome defen&s;ive armour and long &s;pears, and cautiou&s;ly avoiding a pitched battle, formed ambu&s;hes in woods and mora&s;&s;es, from whence they &s;allied out upon detached parties, encumbered by that very equipage which rendered them &s;o formidable in the open plain. The fir&s;t adventurers were
<PB N="370" REF="3790">
hardy Wel&s;hmen, bred up in woods, bogs, and mountains, and inured to danger and fatigue; but as the&s;e were &s;lighted by the young prince, all the mili|tary expeditions were undertaken by the Normans, who though addicted to lux|ury and aver&s;e to labour, were in&s;tigated to action by avarice, and in a little time greatly dimini&s;hed by tho&s;e &s;light &s;kirmi&s;hes, in which the enemy always obtained the advantage. Prince John was void of experience, reflection, and oeconomy; he &s;quandered away the money intended for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the &s;oldiers; &s;aw their number greatly reduced; and the enemy, emboldened by &s;uc|ce&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hove$e$. $ened. Abb.</NOTE> hampered his troops in &s;uch a manner, that they found great difficulty in procuring forage and provi&s;ion. The king, being informed of the&s;e circum|&s;tances, recalled John and his youthful coun&s;ellors, and left the management of affairs to John de Courcy, who, keeping his troops in continual action, attacked the enemy in all quarters, and &s;couring the countries of Corke, Limerick, and Connaught, in a little time compelled them to be quiet.</P>

<P>Immediately before John &s;et out on his Iri&s;h expedition, Heraclius, pa|triarch of Jeru&s;alem, and the great ma&s;ter of the Knights-ho&s;pitallers, arrived in England, with letters from pope Lucius, &s;olliciting Henry to go in per&s;on to the relief of the Holy Land, which was almo&s;t intirely reduced by Saladine. Baldwin IV. who &s;at upon the throne of Jeru&s;alem, was di&s;abled from acting by an inveterate lepro&s;y; his &s;on was a minor, and a competition between Guy de Lu&s;ignan, and Raimund, count of Tripoli, for the management of affairs, had well nigh excited a civil war among the chri&s;tians. Nothing could prevent the impending ruin of the kingdom of Jeru&s;alem, but the arrival of &s;ome power|ful European prince; and in this emergency, Baldwin turned his eyes upon Henry, to whom he was nearly related. He had begun a progre&s;s to the north, when the amba&s;&s;adors arrived; but no &s;ooner heard of their landing, than he returned to Reading, where he gave them audience, receiving from the patri|arch the keys of the holy &s;epulchre, and the royal banner of Jeru&s;alem, which he redelivered to Heraclius, to be kept until he &s;hould have con&s;ulted the pre|lates<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> and nobility of his kingdom. He accordingly convoked a great council at Clerkenwell, in which the king of Scotland and his barons a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and &s;ub|mitted the patriarch's propo&s;al to their con&s;ideration, when, after having duly de|l$berated on the &s;ubject, they were unanimous in their opinion, that the king, in accepting the crown of Jeru&s;alem, and engaging in an expedition to Pale&s;tine, would hazard the &s;afety of his own kingdom. The amba&s;&s;adors thus di&s;ap|pointed of the father, de&s;ired that he would at lea&s;t &s;end one of his &s;ons to their re$ief; and John, throwing him&s;elf at the king's feet, earne&s;tly begged he might be employed in that &s;ervice. But Henry's affection for his children witheld his con&s;ent; and indeed he had already projected that prince's armament for the conque&s;t of Ireland. He therefore offered a large &s;ome of money for pre&s;ent &s;uccour to the chr &s;tian cru&s;ades, but deferred taking any other re&s;olution, with regard to that affair, until he &s;hould have con&s;ulted with the king of France; $$r which purpo&s;e, Henry &s;et out with the patriarch for Normandy; and the two kings conferring upon the &s;ubject at Vaudreuil, agreed to &s;end large &s;upplies of men and money, but neither would go in per&s;on.</P>

<P>It would have been a very ra&s;h undertaking in Henry, and altogether incon&s;i&s;tent with his u&s;ual prudence, to embark per&s;onally in &s;uch an expedition,
<PB N="371" REF="3800">
while his family was divided by di&s;&s;entions, which, in his ab&s;ence, would have made his dominions &s;cenes of blood and de&s;olation. Richard had, in the be|ginning of the year, left England and returned to Guienne, where, forgetting the oath he had lately taken, he fortified his ca&s;tles, and invaded his brother's territories of Bretagne; &s;o that Henry was now obliged to levy an army to reduce him to obedience: though, in order to prevent the effu&s;ion of blood, he had re|cour&s;e to an expedient which an&s;wered his expectation. We have already ob|&s;erved, that queen Eleanor had been &s;et at liberty; and the king kept a court at Wind&s;or, for her and her daughter the dutche&s;s of Saxony. She was now brought over into Normandy, and Richard ordered to &s;urrender the whole county of Guienne as her inheritance, otherwi&s;e he &s;hould be compelled to do<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

The prince, though rough, violent, and head&s;trong, loved his mother with the mo&s;t warm affection, and the &s;ubjects of Guienne, re&s;pecting her as the heire&s;s of their antient princes, he ceded the whole country with all the fortre&s;&s;es to her officers, and &s;ubmitting to his father, took up his re&s;idence at the Engli&s;h court, where he conducted him&s;elf with &s;uch &s;eeming duty and moderation, that Henry re&s;olved to tru&s;t him again with the manage|ment of that province. Raimund, count of Tholou&s;e, had impri&s;oned &s;everal merchants of Guienne, and Richard was &s;ent to take &s;atisfaction for the injury: he forthwith rai&s;ed an army, and wa&s;ted the territories of the count, who in vain &s;ollicited the king of France for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Philip's hands were tied up by a treaty which he had lately concluded with the king of England. The annuity of his &s;i&s;ter Margaret was confirmed, together with the contract of marriage be|tween Richard and Adelais, and Philip renounced all claim to Gi&s;ors and its de|pendencies. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoved.

<P>Henry, having thus &s;ecured the peace of his foreign dominions, re|turned to England, where, in a council held at Oxford, he propo&s;ed to William, king of Scotland, that, as he could not marry Maud daughter of the Saxon, on account of con&s;anguinity, he would e&s;pou&s;e Ermengarde, grand-daughter of Ro&s;celin, vi&s;count of Beaumont le Roger, and Con&s;tance the natural daughter of Henry I. king of England. The propo&s;al was embraced by William, who, while amba&s;&s;adors were &s;ent for the lady, returned to his own country, in order to reduce Roland, the &s;on of Uchtred, who, at the death of his uncle Gilbert, had &s;eized the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Galloway, to the prejudice of Gilbert's &s;on Duncan, who re&s;ided at the Engli&s;h court as an ho&s;tage, under the protection of king Henry. This monarch no &s;ooner received intimation of his having u&s;urped his cou&s;in's dominions, and &s;laughtered all the barons who pre&s;umed to oppo&s;e his inva&s;ion, than he advanced, at the head of a numerous army, to Carli&s;le, where he was vi&s;ited by Roland in per&s;on, who &s;ubmitted and &s;wore fealty, on condition of being allowed to po&s;&s;e&s;s his paternal e&s;tate, and promi&s;ed to &s;tand to the award of the king's court, with regard to his claim to the dominions of Gilbert. The Scotti&s;h king, and his brother David, with the principal nobility of that kingdom, obliged them&s;elves by oath to make war on Roland, &s;hould he renounce the fealty he had &s;worn; and the bi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow engaged to &s;ubject him to the &s;entence of excommunication. William's marriage was afterwards &s;olemnized at Wode&s;toke; upon which occa&s;ion, Henry gave a rent of an hundred marks, with forty knights-fees, as a portion to Ermengarde, and, at the &s;ame time,

<P>Before the celebration of this marriage, the king of England was de|prived of his &s;on Geoffrey; a prince of equal pride, di&s;&s;imulation, and perfidy, who had been deeply engaged in all the unnatural &s;chemes of rebellion which had broke out in the cour&s;e of his father's reign. He had lately demanded the county of Anjou, and met with a denial, becau&s;e Richard would not con&s;ent to the alienation of that province. Exa&s;perated at the refu&s;al, he retired to the court of France, and agreed to hold Brittany in va&s;&s;alage of Philip, and &s;hake off all &s;ubjection to his father, provided the French monarch would a&s;&s;i&s;t him with an army to invade Normandy. But the execution of his perfidious de&s;ign was anticipated by death: he was unhor&s;ed in a tournament, and brui&s;ed in &s;uch a manner that he fell ill of a fever and died in a few days, very little regretted by his father's good &s;ubjects, among whom he was generally di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appellation of "the child of perdition," on account of his undutiful di&s;po&s;ition.<NOTE PLACE="marg">D$eto Col. Ma$. Paris.</NOTE> He left a daughter, named Eleanor, the ward&s;hip of whom was immediately claimed by Philip, as lord paramount of Brittany, who was incen&s;ed at this junc|ture again&s;t Henry, in con&s;equence of a fray that happened between Henry de Veir, governor of Gi&s;ors, and Ralf de Vaus, a French knight, who lo&s;t his life in the encounter. The French king, therefore, threatened to invade the pro|vince, in ca&s;e his demand &s;hould be rejected; and the Engli&s;h king &s;ent am|ba&s;&s;adors to terminate the affair in an amicable manner; &s;o that both parties agreed to a truce, which was afterwards prolonged. At the &s;ame time, a di&s;turbance was rai&s;ed in Brittany, by Guiomar de Leon and his brother; but the dutche&s;s Con&s;tance being delivered of a po&s;thumous &s;on, who was called Arthur, the Bre|tons were &s;o plea&s;ed with this event, that the rebellion immediately &s;ub&s;ided.</P>

<P>A conference being opened at Gu&eacute; St. Remi, between the kings of France and England, in which cardinal Octavian and Hugh Nonant, the pope's legates, acted as mediators for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a &s;olid peace, Philip's de|mands were &s;o unrea&s;onable, that the negociation broke off, and both princes prepared for ho&s;tilities. Henry levying a numerous army, divided it into four bodies, commanded by the princes Richard and John, the earl of Albemarle, and his natural &s;on Geoffrey; and the&s;e divi&s;ions were detached to defend the dif|ferent quarters of his dominions. The French king had recour&s;e to the arts of perfidy, and tampered with Ur&s;e de Fretteval and the count de Nevers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

The two armies were in &s;ight of each other, and actually ranged in order of battle, when the legates denounced anathemas again&s;t him who &s;hould fir&s;t begin the engagement; and by their mediation, &s;upported by the prelates and nobility of both kingdoms, a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chro$ Ge$.</NOTE> truce for two years was concluded.</P>

<P>Immediately after this agreement, Richard accompanied the king of France to Paris, where he was care&s;&s;ed in &s;uch an extraordinary manner, and &s;uch an intimacy en&s;ued between him and Philip, that Henry took the alarm, and &s;u&s;pected &s;omething was hatching to his prejudice. In the&s;e &s;entiments, he

&s;ent &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive me&s;&s;engers to recall Richard, whom he promi&s;ed to gratify with every thing he could demand in rea&s;on; but, in&s;tead of complying with the king's reque&s;t, he went and &s;eized his trea&s;ure at Chinon, and thence repair|ing to Guienne, fortified his ca&s;tles and &s;et his father at defiance, unle&s;s he would forthwith con&s;ent to his coronation. Henry had &s;uffered too much by the ex|periment of that &s;ort which he tried in favour of his elde&s;t &s;on, to repeat it in be|half of the proud imperious Richard, who &s;eemed &s;o &s;trongly connected with his inveterate foe: he therefore rejected the propo&s;al, and made &s;uch remon&s;trances to his &s;on upon the evil con&s;equences of his attachment to Philip, and his own undutiful behaviour, that he &s;eemed &s;en&s;ible of his errors, &s;ubmitted and did homage to his father, and promi&s;ed upon oath, that he would never deviate from his allegiance: yet, in a very little time after this reconciliation, he re|ceived the cro&s;s from the archbi&s;hop of Tours, without the king's con&s;ent or<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dueto Col.</NOTE> knowledge.</P>

<P>Henry pa&s;&s;ed the Chri&s;tmas at Caen, and had already proceeded<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1188.</NOTE> as far as Barfleur in his way to England, when he was given to under&s;tand that the king of France threatened to lay wa&s;te his dominions with fire and &s;word, if he would not immediately re&s;tore Gi&s;ors, or complete the marriage of Ri|chard with Adelais. In con&s;equence of this information, he propo&s;ed another conference, which was held as u&s;ual between Gi&s;ors and Trie, under a va&s;t elm that &s;haded &s;everal acres of ground. At this interview between the two kings, attended by Richard, the prelates and nobility of both nations, the archbi&s;hop of Tyre pronounced &s;uch a melancholy account of Saladine's &s;ucce&s;s in the Holy Land, and the mi&s;eries of the chri&s;tians in that country, that the whole audience was affected with the relation, and the two kings laying a&s;ide their animo&s;ity, agreed to convert their whole attention to the relief of tho&s;e adventurers. They received the cro&s;s from the hands of the archbi&s;hop, re&s;olving to go thither in per&s;on; and their example was followed by Philip, count of Flanders, and a great numher of the prelates and nobility then pre&s;ent. A plenary indulgence was publi&s;hed in the pope's name, for all that would make a fair confe&s;&s;ion of their &s;ins, and engage in the cru&s;ade. The different nations a&s;&s;umed cro&s;&s;es of dif|ferent colour; rules were e&s;tabli&s;hed for preventing riot, luxury, and di&s;order; the two monarchs re&s;olved to levy great armies for the occa&s;ion; and, in order to defray the expence of the expedition, impo&s;ed a tax of a tenth upon all rents and chattles belonging to the clergy as well as the laity, an impo&s;ition known by the name of the Saladine Tythe, which Henry gave immediate orders for levy|ing<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoved</NOTE> throughout his dominions on the continent.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; LIX.</HEAD>
<P>With a view to rai&s;e the &s;ame tax in England, and make the ne|ce&s;&s;ary preparations for his cru&s;ade, he took &s;hipping at Dieppe, and landing at Winchel&s;ea, &s;ummoned a general council at Gedington, where it was re&s;olved to levy a tenth of all rents and moveables belonging to Jews as well as Chri&s;tians; though every per&s;on, whether eccle&s;ia&s;tic or laic, that engaged in the cru&s;ade, was exempted from the tax, and even permitted to mortgage his e&s;tate. Hugh, bi&s;hop of Durham, and &s;ome other noblemen, were &s;ent to de&s;ire William, king of Scotland, would &s;ubject his kingdom to the &s;ame impo&s;ition, and he &s;eemed very well inclined to the expedient; but his prelates, earls, barons, and free tenants, being convened to deliberate on the &s;ubject, ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to &s;addle

<P>While Henry was thus employed in taking mea&s;ures for the relief of Pale&s;tine, his good brother Philip, king of France, who had &s;worn to &s;u&s;pend all ho&s;tilities with the king of England, and to protect his territories until the cru&s;ade &s;hould be fini&s;hed, di&s;regarding this &s;olemn obligation, began to tamper with the barons of Berry, a good number of whom he debauched from their al|legiance: Richard, who &s;eems to have acted in concert with him, pretended to quarrel with the count de Tholou&s;e, and made an incur&s;ion into his country, in order to afford a pretence to Philip, who being &s;ollicited to a&s;&s;i&s;t the count, in|vaded Berry, and was received without oppo&s;ition, into the mo&s;t important towns and fortre&s;&s;es of that dutchy. He made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the greate&s;t part<NOTE PLACE="marg">D$e o Col.</NOTE> of Auvergne in the &s;ame manner, and then entering Touraine, extended his conque&s;ts with &s;urpri&s;ing rapidity. Henry, alarmed at this breach of &s;tipulations, &s;ent Baldwin, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, with the bi&s;hops of Lincoln and Che&s;|ter, as amba&s;&s;adors to the court of France, to complain of tho&s;e ho&s;tilities, and demand re&s;titution of the places he had taken.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; LXI.</HEAD>
<P>Philip added in&s;ult to inju&s;tice, and refu&s;ed an audience to tho&s;e pre|lates; &s;o that Henry was obliged to arm in his own defence. Having a&s;&s;embled a &s;trong body of Engli&s;h, reinforced with &s;everal thou&s;ands of Wel&s;h infantry, he tran&s;ported them, without delay, into Normandy, where they were joined by the troops of that dutchy: but before he would commence ho&s;tilities, he di&s;patch|ed the archbi&s;hop of Rouen to Paris, with another demand of re&s;titution, or in ca&s;e of a refu&s;al to renounce all fealty to Philip, in Henry's name, and to de|clare,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Be$ed. Abb.</NOTE> that the king of England would, for the future, look upon him as his mortal enemy. To this me&s;&s;age Philip an&s;wered, that he was determined to pro&s;ecute the war, until he &s;hould have reduced Berry and the Vexin Nor|mand; and Henry, &s;eeing no pro&s;pect of a peace, began his march towards the French territories. Having burned S. Clair &s;ur Epte and &s;ome other towns, he adva$ced to Mante, where he under&s;tood the French army was encamped; but, Philip avoiding a battle, he marched to Ivry, from whence he &s;ent out detachments to ravage the French frontiers; and Danville with Dreux, and &s;eve|ral other places, were reduced to a&s;hes. The French king, finding him&s;elf un|able to cope with &s;uch an adver&s;ary, was fain to &s;ue for peace, and offered of his own accord to re&s;tore all the places he had taken in Berry. A conference was immediately opened, and continued three days, during which Philip, in all pro|babillity, took $mbrage at the nature of the debates; for the negociation did not &s;ucceed; and the king of France wreaked his re&s;entment on the &s;pread|ing elm, which, being within his territories, he ordered to be cut down, be|cau&s;e Henry delighted in &s;itting under it's &s;hade. The counts of Flanders and Blois, with &s;everal noblemen of France, di&s;gu&s;ted at the pride, ob&s;tinacy, and unrea&s;onable demands of Philip, laid down their arms, declaring they would never u&s;e them again&s;t Chri&s;tians, until they &s;hould have returned from Jeru&s;a|lem; and the French monarch, thus weakened, de&s;ired another conference, in order to make a parade of his pacific di&s;po&s;ition. This too proved ineffectual, from his in&s;olent demand of the ca&s;tle of Pacey, as a &s;ecurity for Henry's per|forming the other articles to which they agreed; a propo&s;al, which very ill be|came

<P>Though the conference did not produce an immediate accommo|dation, the parties &s;till negociated by deputies, with &s;uch a pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, that Henry &s;ent back his Welch troops, and di&s;banded the mercenaries, and another interview was appointed at Bon-Moulins, for putting the fini&s;hing &s;troke to the treaty. At this meeting Henry propo&s;ed, that in&s;tead of protracting a trouble&s;ome di&s;pute, they &s;hould re&s;tore what had been &s;eized on both &s;ides &s;ince they took the cro&s;s, and conclude at once a &s;olid and equitable peace. This propo&s;ition was warmly oppo&s;ed by Richard, who refu&s;ed to part with his conque&s;ts; and Philip, though he offered to give up the places he had taken, in&s;i&s;ted upon his &s;i&s;ter's being immediately married to Richard; and required that all the &s;ubjects of England, Normandy, and Henry's other dominions, &s;hould take the oath of allegiance to that young prince. The king of Eng|land replied, that the marriage &s;hould be immediately con&s;ummated, provided Philip would cede Bourges, and perform all the articles of the contract; but, the other demand he ab&s;olutely rejected, as an in&s;ult upon his authority. Rich|ard, hearing this refu&s;al, was tran&s;ported with fury and indignation, and throw|ing him&s;elf at Philip's feet, did in&s;tant homage for Normandy, and all the other provinces holding of France, of which he now received the inve&s;titure. While Henry &s;at motionle&s;s and confounded at this extraordinary &s;cene, Philip and his new va&s;&s;al retired, to the amazement of the &s;pectators, who now plainly perceived, that this was a preconcerted &s;cheme between the French king and Richard.</P>

<P>His father &s;oon recollected him&s;elf from his confu&s;ion; and, in or|der to prevent the de&s;igns of his enemies, marched immediately into Guienne, after having di&s;patched his chancellor Geoffrey to &s;ecure the ca&s;tles of Anjou again&s;t the attempts of the confederates. Cardinal Albano, &s;ent by pope Cle|ment III. as his legate, to con&s;olidate a peace between the two crowns, excom|municated Richard, as the chief ob&s;tacle to the treaty: and this prelate dying, the pope, unea&s;y at the delay of the expedition to Pale&s;tine, inve&s;ted the cardinal of Anagni with the legatine power, as well as with in&s;tructions to effect a reconciliation between the two monarchs. This new prelate ar|riving in France, prevailed upon both parties to refer their di&s;putes to the arbitration of him and the archbi&s;hop of Rheims, Bourges, Rouen, and Canterbury; and this la&s;t was, in the mean time, &s;ent to reclaim Richard with gentle remon&s;trances. But all his endeavours proved ineffectual: he had been infected with jealou&s;ies by his patron of France, and believed, or pretend|ed to believe, his father de&s;igned to di&s;inherit him in favour of his younger bro|ther. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this idle conceit, which had no foundation, and confident of his own merit, he rejected all overtures towards a reconciliation, and employ|ed all his intere&s;t in rai&s;ing up enemies again&s;t his father. He debauched from their allegiance, many noblemen of Normandy, Anjou, and Guienne, who took this opportunity of wor&s;hipping the ri&s;ing &s;un.

<P>At the expiration of the truce which had been agreed upon in the beginning of the la&s;t conference, this con&s;piracy manife&s;ted it&s;elf in action, and Richard made &s;ome incur&s;ions into his father's territories; but the&s;e were interrupted by a renewal of the truce, at the in&s;tance of the mediators; and Henry derived great hopes of a la&s;ting peace, from the abilities and good-will of the legate. By his interpo&s;ition another conference was held at La Fert&eacute; Ber|nard, where Philip not only repeated his former demands, but added another condition, namely, that prince John &s;hould accompany his brother to the Holy Land, an expedition from which the father was excu&s;ed on account of his age and infirmities. His pretence for making this propo&s;al was, that John might not take the advantage of Richard's ab&s;ence to mount the throne at his father's de|cea&s;e: but Philip's real motive for making this unrea&s;onable demand, &s;eems to have been a de&s;ire of ob&s;tructing the peace, and widening the breach between Henry and his heir, who&s;e jealou&s;y was confirmed by his father's rejecting the propo&s;ition. The king of England ob&s;erved, that Richard had taken the cro&s;s without his knowledge; and that if his &s;on had been guilty of an indi&s;creet ac|tion, it was no rea&s;on that he &s;hould commit a greater, in expo&s;ing his domini|ons to the ambition of a foreign invader, in ca&s;e he him&s;elf &s;hould die, during the ab&s;ence of both his children. The legate, who could not help a&s;&s;enting to the ju&s;tice of his plea, exerted all his eloquence towards a pacification: but finding the French king inflexible, he threatened to lay an interdict upon his do|minions. Philip heard him with &s;ilent &s;corn; but the furious Richard un&s;heath|ing his &s;word, would have &s;acrificed the cardinal on the &s;pot, had not the other members of the a&s;&s;embly interpo&s;ed; and prevented him from executing his frantic purpo&s;e. Henry, dubious of the event of this conference, had &s;ent Ralf de Glanville to England, to fetch over all his knights, in who&s;e loyalty he could confide, amid&s;t the defection of his Norman &s;ubjects, who dropped away daily at the pro&s;pect of his di&s;tre&s;s: but his enemies did not allow him time to avail him&s;elf of this reinforcement.</P>

<P>Immediately after the conference, Philip and Richard retired to No|gent de Rotrou, where their army was cantoned. There a&s;&s;embling their troops, they advanced with great expedition, and reduced La Fert&eacute; Bernard, Monfort, Male&s;table, Beaumont, and Balon. Then taking the route to Tours, wheeled about unexpectedly, and marched directly to Mans, where Henry was quartered with &s;even hundred knights, and a &s;mall body of forces. Their &s;udden appear|ance threw his followers into &s;uch confu&s;ion, that Stephen de Tours, &s;ene&s;chal of Anjou, &s;etting the &s;uburbs on fire, the flames were allowed to &s;pread over the walls, and occa&s;ion a conflagration in the city. Geoffrey de Bruilon endea|vouring to &s;top the progre&s;s of the enemy, by breaking down a &s;tone bridge built over the Sarte, was attacked, wounded, and taken pri&s;oner; and his men flying in di&s;order, were pur&s;ued by the French to the city, which they entered along with them pell-mell. Henry, &s;eeing it impracticable to rectify the di&s;or|der
<PB N="377" REF="3860">
occa&s;ioned by the fire and the enemy, retired with his troops towards Fre|nelles, leaving thirty knights and twice that number of &s;oldiers in the tower of Le Mans, which, after having been battered three days, was obliged to &s;ur|render. The king di&s;patched William Fitz-Ralf, &s;ene&s;chal of Normandy, with William Mandeville, earl of E&s;&s;ex, and Aumale, to defend that province; and ordered his chancellor Geoffrey to march with the bulk of his army to Alen&ccedil;on; while he him&s;elf repaired with a &s;mall train to Angers, and was in a little time joined by a reinforcement of knights at Savigny. Philip and Rich|ard, mean while, met with no oppo&s;ition. A number of towns and ca&s;tles &s;ub|mitted at the fir&s;t &s;ummons; till at length fording the river Loire, they inve&s;t|ed the city of Tours, which they took by &s;calade, while the inhabitants locked them&s;elves up in their hou&s;es, not dreaming of re&s;i&s;tance.</P>

<P>Conferences had &s;till been carried on at Azay, by the legate, pre|lates, and nobility of both kingdoms; and the count of Flanders, with the duke of Burgundy, and the archbi&s;hop of Rheims arrived at Tours with the articles of peace, which had been &s;ettled. The&s;e being qualified by Philip, were,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

He &s;aw his forces dimini&s;h daily by de&s;ertion, his cities and fortre&s;&s;es given up to the enemy; he &s;u&s;pected treachery on all &s;ides, and as he knew not whom to tru&s;t, agreed to ratify the articles. The&s;e obliged him to renew his homage to Philip, which he had renounced in the beginning of the war; and to deliver Adelais into the hands of five per&s;ons nominated by Rich|ard, who &s;hould e&s;pou&s;e that prince&s;s after his return from Pale&s;tine. He agreed that all his va&s;&s;als &s;hould take the oath of fealty to Richard, before his departure; and to pay twenty thou&s;and marks of &s;ilver to the king of France, for defraying the expence of fortifying Chateauroux. Philip, on the other hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ben. Abbas. Duet Coll. G. Brito. Philipiade. G.

<P>This treaty was fir&s;t concluded at Azay, and in a few days after the agreement &s;igned in another conference at the &s;ame place, from whence the king, in a very ill &s;tate of health, was removed to Chinon. He had been long infirm, and was now &s;eized with a fever, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to be the immediate effect of vexation. He had formerly &s;een his children rebel; but now he &s;aw his &s;on his conqueror; he &s;aw him&s;elf bere&s;t at once of his power, his authority, and faculties; reduced to the condition of a fugitive, and almo&s;t of a &s;uppliant in his old age, by the ingratitude of his own i&s;&s;ue; and to com|plete his chagrin, prince John, upon who&s;e fidelity and affection he had repo&s;ed him&s;elf with full confidence, de&s;erted him in his retreat from Le Mans, and joined his adver&s;aries. This was the &s;evere&s;t &s;troke he had hitherto felt, and doubtle&s;s co-operated with his di&s;temper, of which he died at Chinon, two days after the ratification of the treaty. His corp&s;e was conveyed by his natural &s;on Geoffrey to the nunnery of Fontevrault; and next day, while it lay in the abbey church, Richard chancing to enter, was &s;truck with horror at the &s;ight.

<P>Thus died Henry, in the fifty-&s;eventh year of his age, and thirty fifth of his reign; in the cour&s;e of which he had, on &s;undry occa&s;ions, di&s;played all the abilities of a politician, all the &s;agacity of a legi&s;lator, and all the mag|nanimity $f a hero. He lived revered above all the princes of his time; and his death was deeply lamented by his &s;ubjects, who&s;e happine&s;s &s;eems to have been the chief aim of all his endeavours. He not only enacted whole&s;ome laws, but &s;aw them executed with great punctuality. He was generous even to admiration, with regard to tho&s;e who committed offences again&s;t his own per&s;on, but he never forgave the injuries that were offered to his people; for atrocious crimes were puni&s;hed &s;everely, without re&s;pect of per&s;ons. He was of the middle &s;ta|ture, and the mo&s;t exact proportion; his countenance was round, fair, and rud|dy; his blue eyes were mild and engaging, except in a tran&s;port of pa&s;&s;ion, when they &s;parkled like lightening, to the terror of the beholders. He was broad che&s;ted, &s;trong, mu&s;cular, and inclined to be corpulent, though he prevented the bad effects of this di&s;po&s;ition, by hard exerci&s;e and continual fatigue; he was temperate in his meals, even to a degree of ab&s;tinence, and &s;eldom or never &s;at down, except at &s;upper; he was eloquent, agreeable, and facetious$ remark|ably courteous and polite; compa&s;&s;ionate to all in di&s;tre&s;s; &s;o charitable, that he con&s;tantly allotted one tenth of his hou&s;hold provi&s;ions to the poor; and in a time of dearth which prevailed in Anjou and Le Maine, he maintained ten thou&s;and in|digent per&s;ons, from the beginning of &s;pring till the end of autumn. His talents naturally good, he had cultivated with great a&s;&s;iduity, and delighted in the conver&s;ation of learned men, to whom he was a generous benefactor. His me|mory was &s;o &s;urpri&s;ingly tenacious, that he never forgot a face nor a circum&s;tance that was worth remembring. Though &s;uperior to all his cotemporaries in &s;trength, riches, true courage and military &s;kill, he never engaged in war with|out reluctance; and was &s;o aver&s;e to blood&s;hed, that he expre&s;&s;ed uncommon grief at the lo&s;s of every private &s;oldier. Yet was he not exempted from human frailties: his pa&s;&s;ions naturally violent, often hurried him into exce&s;s; he was prone to anger, tran&s;ported with the lu&s;t of power, and in particular accu&s;ed of inconti|nence, not only in the affair of Ro&s;amond, whom he is &s;aid to have concealed in a labyrinth at Wode&s;toke, from the jealous inquiry of his wife, but al&s;o in a &s;uppo&s;ed commerce with the French prince&s;s Adelais, who was bred in England as the future wife of his &s;on Richard. This infamous breach of honour and ho&s;pitality, if he was actually guilty, is the foule&s;t &s;tain upon his character, though the fact is doubtful, and we hope, the charge untrue. He was educated with high notions of the kingly prerogative, which he maintained with amazing fortitude, again&s;t all the artillery of Rome, and all the machinations of trea&s;on; for the cau&s;e of royalty happened to be connected with the independency of the Engli&s;h church, for which he manife&s;ted the mo&s;t inviolable attachment: yet his exertion of the prerogative never interfered with the liberties of his people, which
<PB N="379" REF="3880">
he intrenched with many excellent laws and regulations, that rendered their bur|thens ea&s;y and their property &s;ecure. In a word, he was the king, the prie&s;t, the father of his country, and one of the mo&s;t powerful and illu&s;trious monarchs that ever flouri&s;hed on the Engli&s;h throne <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">By his queen Eleanor he had five &s;ons and three daughters: namely, William, who died in his infancy; Henry, who&s;e hi&s;tory we have recorded; Richard, who &s;ucceeded to his fa|ther's throne; Geoffrey, who died at Paris, as we have mentioned above; and John, &s;urnam|ed Sans Terre, who a&s;cended the throne after Richard's death: Maude, married to Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony and Bavaria; Eleanor, wife of Alphon&s;us VIII. king of Ca&s;tile; Joane, matched with William II. king of Sicily, and, after his death, married to Raimund VI. count of Thoulou&s;e. Henry had likewi&s;e by the fair Ro&s;amond, William Longue E&s;p&eacute;e, created earl of Sali&s;bury; and Geoffrey, bi&s;hop elect of Lin|coln, and afterwards chancellor. There was al&s;o one Morgan, a Wel&s;hman, provo&s;t of Be|verly, who pretended to be his natural &s;on, by the lady of a knight named Ralf Bloet; but this pretence &s;eems to have been founded on nothing but the man's own vanity and madne&s;s.

<P>RICHARD, &s;urnamed Coeur de Lion or Lion's-heart, from his in|trepidity, &s;ucceeded without oppo&s;ition to his father's throne, and be|gan his reign with &s;uch an act of tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion, as mu&s;t have afforded a very uncomfortable omen to his &s;ubjects. His father's ob&s;equies were &s;carce performed, when he ordered Stephen de Tours, the late king's &s;ene&s;chal, to be arre&s;ted and loaded with &s;hackles, until he had delivered up, not only the trea&s;ure committed to his charge, but al&s;o his own fortune, amounting to five and forty thou&s;and Angeven livres: then he cau&s;ed him to be divorced from his wife, becau&s;e &s;he was a gentlewoman, and he of ignoble de&s;cent; and declared, he would by his own authority annul all &s;uch unequal marriages. This man, however, whom he knew to be a faithful &s;ervant of his father, he would not di&s;mi&s;s from his employment; for he continued &s;till to manage the revenue of Anjou; and indeed it mu&s;t be owned for the credit of Richard's good &s;en&s;e, that he retained in his &s;ervice all the loyal adherents of the late king; and di&s;carded tho&s;e who had de&s;erted their ma&s;ter, even in his own favour.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1189.</NOTE> The&s;e, whether eccle&s;ia&s;tic or laymen, he expelled from his court, and ever after de&s;pi&s;ed as perfidious traitors; and when &s;ome barons, who had &s;erved him in his la&s;t revolt, demanded re&s;titution of their lands and ca&s;tles, which they had forfeited in former rebellions, he ordered them to be re&s;tored according to his promi&s;e, but he ejected them the very next day, ob&s;erving, that tho&s;e who de|&s;erted<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brompton.

<P>The affairs of Guienne and Anjou being &s;ettled according to his plea|&s;ure, he repaired to Normandy, and was, by the archbi&s;hops of Canterbury and Rouen, ab&s;olved at Seez of the crime he had committed in taking up arms again&s;t his father, after having engaged in the cru&s;ade. After his ab&s;olution he was inve&s;ted with the ducal &s;word and banner, and received the homage of all the nobility in the province; upon which occa&s;ion he di&s;played his genero&s;ity in divers acts of favour. He be&s;towed his niece Maude upon Geoffrey, &s;on of Rotrou count de Perche: he gave the daughter of Richard Strongbow in mar|riage to his favourite William Mare&s;chal; and to Gilbert, the &s;on of Roger Fitz-Rainfray, Eloi&s;a, daughter and heire&s;s of William de Lanca&s;ter, baron of Ken|dal. He confirmed his brother John in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the four thou&s;and marks a year in England, and the county of Mortaign in Normandy, which had been been &s;ettled upon him by his father, be&s;ides the honour of Glouce&s;ter, by virtue of his marriage with the late earl's daughter; and gave the royal a&s;&s;ent to the election of his natural brother Geoffrey to the &s;ee of York, though he afterwards &s;eized his ca&s;tles in Normandy, which he obliged him to redeem with a con&s;i|derable &s;um of money. In a few days after his inauguration, he had an inter|view, between Chaumont and Trie, with the king of France, who re&s;tored the

<P>Having regulated his foreign affairs, he re&s;olved to vi&s;it his Briti&s;h do|minions, which, &s;ince his father's death, had been governed by his mother Eleanor, whom he had impowered to publi&s;h an act of grace, in favour of all pri&s;oners and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, except &s;uch as had turned evidence again&s;t their accompl ces, which informers had no benefit of this indulgence. Robert, earl of Leice&s;ter, now retrieved his ca&s;tles, which Henry had kept as &s;ecurity for his good behaviour; and other forfeited barons were indulged with the like re&s;titution. The appenage of prince John was con&s;iderably increa&s;ed by grants of lands and ca&s;tles, and by marrying the heire&s;s of the late earl of Glouce&s;ter, tho' within the prohibited degrees of con&s;anguinity, he became ma&s;ter of a ve|ry con&s;iderable part of the realm. All the freemen throughout the kingdom had, by order of the queen-mother, taken the oath of fealty to Richard before his arrival, and now the &s;ame was taken by the prelates and nobility at his coro|nation, which was &s;olemnized in the abbey of We&s;tmin&s;ter, Ralf de Dueto, dean of St. Paul's, officiating in the room of the bi&s;hop of London, becau&s;e the &s;ee happened to be then vacant.</P>

<P>Richard had i&s;&s;ued a proclamation forbidding, all Jews to enter the church, during the coronation &s;ervice, or intrude into the palace while he &s;hould be at dinner Notwith&s;tanding this prohibition, which &s;eems to have been in|tended merely for the prevention of a croud, a few wealthy Hebrews, in&s;tigated by cur o&s;ity, endeavoured to pa&s;s unob&s;erved in the multitude; but were detect|ed, and roughly repelled. This violence produced a fray, in which &s;everal Jews were trodden under foot and &s;lain, as that people were extremely odious at this juncture, when the &s;uper&s;tition of the Chri&s;tians was inflamed by the preaching of monks in favour of the cru&s;ade. The populace of London, hearing the king had ordered the Jews to be exterminated, immediately took to arms, and be&s;ieg|ed the merchants of that nation in their hou&s;es, after having murdered all the I&s;raelites that fell in their way. The king was no &s;ooner appri&s;ed of this tumult than he &s;ent Ralf de Glanville, the chief ju&s;ticiary, and other noblemen, into the city to quell the di&s;turbance and prevent further mi&s;chief; but all their en|deavours proved ineffectual; and they were obliged to fly for the &s;afety of their own lives. The rabble finding it impracticable to force the &s;trong hou&s;es to which the Jews had retired, &s;et them on fire; &s;o that a conflagration began at different corners of the city; and the mob taking advantage of the confu&s;ion and terror which they produced, plundered Jews and Chri&s;tians without di&s;tinction. The former peri&s;hed either by the flames or the fury of an enraged populace; a great number of citizens were burned out of their habitations, and utterly ruined; and the di&s;turbance continued till morning, when the rabble di&s;per&s;ed. Richard ordered the ringleaders of this outrageous tumult to be apprehended,<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. Neubrig. Bened Ab$a$. Matth. Par.</NOTE> and tried by the laws of the land: and they being convicted and executed, he publi&s;hed a proclamation, prohibiting &s;uch tumults for the future, and taking the Jews under his royal protection. Notwith&s;tanding this precaution, the Jews were afterwards ma&s;&s;acred at Lyme, Stamford, and York, though avarice &s;eems to have been more concerned than religious zeal, in tho&s;e in&s;tances of barbar$ty; for many gentlemen of the province were concerned in the carnage of

York, who, having been indebted to the Jews, no &s;ooner made an end of but|chering that unhappy people, to the number of five hundred, than they repaired to the cathedral, where their bonds were depo&s;ited, compelled the officer to deli|ver the&s;e obligations, and burned them in the church with great &s;olemnity. The king, incen&s;ed at this in&s;ult upon his authority, which al&s;o affected his revenue, ina&s;much as he was heir to the per&s;onal e&s;tates of u&s;urers, ordered the bi&s;hop of Fly, at that time ju&s;ticiary of the realm, to make &s;evere examples of the guilty: but, before he arrived in York&s;hire, the principal offenders had fled into Scotland; and the citizens of York imputing what had happened to the fury of the ungo|vernable multitude, the prelate contented him&s;elf with depriving the high &s;heriff and the governor of their offices, and levying fines upon the wealthie&s;t of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

<P>Richard, in the fir&s;t a&s;&s;embly of his prelates and nobility convened after his coronation, at the abbey of Pupewell, in Northampton&s;hire, filled up the vacant &s;ees of London, Winche&s;ter, Sarum, and Ely; and deliberated upon mea&s;ures for enabling him to equip a powerful armament again&s;t the infidels, who had over-run the Holy Land. Geoffrey Riddel, late bi&s;hop of Ely, dying inte&s;tate, the king had &s;eized his effects to a con&s;iderable value: he found in his father's trea&s;ury at Winche&s;ter, gold and &s;ilver, jewels, and rich uten&s;ils, to the amount of nine hundred thou&s;and pounds: but even this va&s;t &s;um was in&s;ufficient for the purpo&s;es of his expedition. He &s;old the earldom of Nor|thumberland to Hugh, bi&s;hop of Durham, for his natural life, and the honour of Sudberg to him and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in that &s;ee, for ever. He &s;et up to &s;ale the offices of high-&s;heriffs, keepers of fore&s;ts, and many other lucrative po&s;ts and dignities. He received con&s;iderable &s;ums from the barons of Bedford&s;hire, and the knights of Surry, for disfore&s;ting parts of their country, which he had converted into fore&s;t-ground. Liberties, charters, ca&s;tles, and manors of the crown, were given away to the highe&s;t bidders; and when &s;ome of his friends demon&s;trated to him the bad effects of &s;uch alienation, he told them he would &s;ell the city of London, if he could find a purcha&s;er. Ralf de Glanville, find|ing him deaf to all hone&s;t advice, and &s;quandering away the crown deme&s;nes in &s;uch a profu&s;e, unthrifty, and pernicious manner, re&s;igned his place of ju&s;ti|ciary, and engaged in the cru&s;ade; and his po&s;t was filled by Hugh, bi&s;hop of Durham, and William de Mandeville, earl of E&s;&s;ex and Albemarle, the former of the&s;e giving a thou&s;and marks for this employment. Be&s;ides the&s;e expedients<NOTE PLACE="marg">Duet. Coll.</NOTE> for rai&s;ing money, Richard obtained a bull from pope Clement, impowering him to excu&s;e from the cru&s;ade all tho&s;e whom he &s;hould judge nece&s;&s;ary to be le&s;t at home for the defence of the kingdom; and a great number of people who had taken the cro&s;s in the fir&s;t tran&s;port of enthu&s;ia&s;m, were now glad to em|brace this indulgence. By the&s;e means the king rai&s;ed a greater &s;um of money, than any one of his predece&s;&s;ors had been known to po&s;&s;e&s;s. The Welch, upon the death of the late king, had, under Re&s;e ap Griffith and his &s;on, reduced &s;everal ca&s;tles, and ravaged the counties of Pembroke and Carmarthen; but this prince afterwards obtained a &s;afe conduct from John, and came to make his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion in the king's court at Oxford; Richard, however, refu&s;ed to &s;ee him, and he returned to his own country meditating revenge. To anticipate his at|tempt, John was directed to march into Wales with a body of forces;

<P>While Richard was employed in making preparations for carrying his grand de&s;ign into execution, Rotrou, count of Perche, and other amba&s;&s;adors, came over to notify the re&s;olution of the French king and his barons, who had &s;worn in a general council held at Paris, to meet by the clo&s;e of Ea&s;ter at the general rendezvous near Vezelay; to which place, Richard and his people were &s;ummoned, that the two kings might &s;et out together for the cru&s;ade. The king immediately convoked a general a&s;&s;embly at London, where the earl of E&s;&s;$x &s;wore, in h$s name, that he would repair to the place of rendezvous, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">H$veden.</NOTE> meet Philip at the time appointed. A di&s;pute ari&s;ing at this period, between Baldwin, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and the monks of Chri&s;t-church, about a college o$ &s;ecular canons founded at Hakington, the monks complained to the pope, that this new foundation was intended to deprive them of the right of electing the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and throw that power into the hands of the fuffragans. Clement, e&s;pou&s;ing their cau&s;e, &s;ent a legate to determine the controver$y; but the king, unwilling to &s;ee &s;uch an in&s;tance of papal authority exerted in his domin$ons, prevailed upon the complainants to refer the di&s;pute to his own deci&s;ion. He forthwith repaired to Canterbury, with a va&s;t number of his prelates and nobility, and decreed that the new foundation &s;hould be demoli&s;hed: then the cardinal Anagni, legate from the pope, who had been detained a whole fortnight at Dover, by the king's expre&s;s order, was invited to Cant$rbury, and honourably received, though Richard would not allow him to exerci&s;e his legatine authority, except in removing the interdict, which Baldwin had laid upon the lands of prince John, when he married the heire&s;s of Gl$uce&s;ter.</P>

<P>During Richard's &s;tay at Canterbury, he was vi&s;ited by William, king of Scotland, who, taking advantage of his impatience to proceed on this expe|dition to the Holy Land, and his eager de&s;ire of ama&s;&s;ing money for that pur|po&s;e, pre&s;ented him with ten thou&s;and marks &s;terling, in con&s;ideration of his &s;ur|rendering the ca&s;tles of B$rwick and Roxburg, renouncing the &s;uperiority of the k$ngdom $f Scotland, delivering up the in&s;trument containing the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of him and all his barons, and receiving$William's homage for the northern coun|ties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Be$ed.

The guardian&s;hip of the kingdom he con|ferred on William Lo$gchamp, bi&s;hop of Ely, a Frenchman of low original, without influence or authority; and with him joined the bi&s;hop of Durham, as ju&s;ticiary in the northern counties.

<P>The&s;e precautions being taken, Richard, accompanied by the legate, &s;et sail from Dover, and landed the &s;ame day at Gravelines, where he was met by the count of Flanders, who attended him into Normandy. There he prac|ti&s;ed a low artifice which di&s;graced his character, though it an&s;wered his purpo&s;e of extorting money from his &s;ubjects. He pretended to have lost the great

seal, that he might have a pretence for i&s;&s;uing a proclamation, that no credit &s;hould be given to any deed, grant, or in&s;trument, until it &s;hould receive the &s;anction of the new &s;eal, which he ordered to be made for this purpo&s;e: at the &s;ame time he ordered all per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch grants to bring them in, that they might be &s;ealed anew, and levied large fines for this indulgence. To crown his avarice, he directed the bi&s;hop of Ely, ve&s;ted with the legatine power, as well as the royal authority, in England, Wales, and Ireland, to oblige every abbey and crown manor to furni&s;h one palfrey and &s;umpter hor&s;e, and every city<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bened. Abb. M. Paris.</NOTE> in the kingdom to find double the number, for the purpo&s;es of the expedition. The queen of France dying in the interim, the rendezvous was deferred till Mid|&s;ummer; but in order to adju&s;t matters in &s;uch a manner, as would prevent all di&s;putes, the two kings agreed to a conference at Gu&eacute; S. Remi, where they, and their prelates, and nobility, mutually &s;wore to maintain peace, and defend each others territories; and, in case either of the princes &s;hould die on the expe|dition, it was determined, that the &s;urvivor &s;hould &s;ucceed to the command of his troops and money, for the advantage of the &s;ervice. After this interview, Richard &s;ent for his mother Eleanor from England, together with Adelais, the &s;i&s;ter of Philip, his own brother John, the two archbi&s;hops, and all the other prelates, before whom he exacted an oath of John, and Geoffrey, archbi&s;hop of York, importing, that they &s;hould not &s;et foot in England for three years, be|fore the expiration of which he propo&s;ed to return from Pale&s;tine: but at the reque&s;t of his mother he relea&s;ed them both from this obligation. His large fleet a&s;&s;embled from different ports of the kingdom, being well manned, victu|alled, and &s;upplied with &s;tores for the expedition, he, by the advice of his pre|lates and nobility, enacted a body of regulations for the maintenance of peace, order, and di&s;cipline on board, appointing five ju&s;ticiaries to &s;ee them punc|tually executed, and i&s;&s;ued orders for its &s;ailing to Mar&s;eilles, where he pro|po&s;ed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoveden.

<P>When the time appointed for the rendezvous approached, he received the &s;crip and &s;taff from the archbi&s;hop of Tours, and marched to Vezelay, where he was joined by the king of France. From thence they took the route to Lyons at the head of one hundred thou&s;and men; but finding it ex|tremely inconvenient for &s;uch a va&s;t body to march together, the two kings parted at this city, Philip proceeding to Genoa, and Richard turning off to|wards Mar&s;eilles, where he found a great number of pilgrims, who, having &s;pent all their &s;ub&s;tance in waiting for a pa&s;&s;age, made him a tender of their &s;er|vice, and were retained. Having waited a whole week for the arrival of his fleet, he hired three large ve&s;&s;els and twenty gallies, for his hou&s;hold, with which he embarked for Sicily, and putting in at Salerno, remained in that place, until he was informed that his fleet had arrived in the harbour of Mefsina. Thi|ther he immediately followed it, and, finding the king of France lodged in the town, took up his quarters in the &s;uburbs. As he propo&s;ed to pa&s;s the winter in this i&s;land, he &s;eized two &s;trong ca&s;tles &s;ituated on the Fare, one of which he a&s;&s;igned for the accommodation of his &s;i&s;ter, widow of the late king of Sicily, and the other he converted into a magazine.</P>

who happened to be within the city, expelled them with great in&s;olence, &s;hut their gates, manned their walls, and &s;et Richard at defiance.

Richard, enraged at this in&s;ult, took to his arms immediately, and charging the citizens, not only repul&s;ed them to the gates, but a&s;&s;aulted the city it&s;elf with &s;uch fury, that notwith&s;tanding the re&s;i&s;tance of the inhabitants, reinforced by the French troops quartered within the walls, the place was taken by a&s;&s;ault, and the &s;tandard of England di&s;played upon the ram|parts.<NOTE PLACE="marg">D$$to Col.</NOTE> The king of France, who had entered the city immediately before the attack, exerted all his vigour in the defence of the place, and &s;hot three Eng|li&s;h &s;oldiers with a cro&s;s-bow from the walls; &s;o that Richard had great cau&s;e to complain of his behaviour; neverthele&s;s, his conduct on this occa&s;ion was remarkably moderate: far from mole&s;ting the French quarters, he quitted the city, and encamped within a fortification which he erected in the &s;uburbs. This conde&s;cen&s;ion, however, could not appea&s;e the re&s;entment of Philip, who re|garded the a&s;&s;ault as an affront offered to his dignity; and from this period con|ceived an implacable rancour again&s;t the king of England. This grudge how|ever be thought proper to conceal for the pre&s;ent, and agreed with Richard in making ordinances to be ob&s;erved by both armies, for the prevention of gam|ing, clipping money, and dearth of provi&s;ions; as al&s;o for the choice of whole|&s;ome victuals, the regulation of markets, and the reduction of immoderate pro|fit on merchandize. Richard, in order to render providence propitious to the undertaking, granted a charter in behalf of his Engli&s;h &s;ubjects who &s;hould &s;uf|fer by &s;hipwreck, giving up in their favour, the right which the crown had to the goods &s;aved in &s;uch di&s;a&s;ters: at the &s;ame time, he put him&s;elf in a cour&s;e<NOTE PLACE="marg">M.

<P>The Me&s;&s;ine&s;e had &s;marted &s;everely in their quarrel with the king of England, who had permitted the &s;oldiers to plunder the city; and their king Tancred found him&s;elf extremely incommoded by the di&s;pute, in con&s;equence of which an hundred thou&s;and &s;laves had e&s;caped to the mountains, from whence they made incur&s;ions, and ravaged the whole country. The Sicilian prelates had laboured to effect an accommodation, and the king, in effect an u&s;urper, who&s;e crown was di&s;puted by Henry VI. emperor of Germany, in right of his wife Con&s;tance, unwilling to incur the re&s;entment of &s;uch a powerful prince as Richard, made uncommon advances towards a treaty of peace. This was at length concluded, on condition that Tancred &s;hould pay to Richard twenty thou&s;and o&uacute;nces of gold, in lieu of legacies bequeathed to Henry of England, by the late king William II. who had married his daughter; that he &s;hould be&s;tow one of his daughters in marriage on young Arthur, duke of Brittany, whom Richard had declared his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, in ca&s;e he him&s;elf &s;hould die without i&s;&s;ue; and that twenty thou&s;and ounces of gold &s;hould be forthwith depo&s;ited as her<NOTE PLACE="marg">$bid.</NOTE> fortune, to be re&s;tored, provided the marriage &s;hould not take effect. As for the inhabitants of Me&s;&s;ina, Richard ordered the plunder to be re&s;tored; but
<PB N="387" REF="3960">
knowing them to be a faithle&s;s mongrel race, de&s;cended from Greeks, Lom|bards, and Saracens, he ordered them to pull down their gates, and deliver ho&s;|tages for their peaceable behaviour: then he built a &s;trong ca&s;tle upon the top of an high mountain that over-looked the city, di&s;tingui&s;hing it by the appella|tion of Mate-Griffon, or Griffon-Slayer, alluding to the name of Griffons, be|&s;towed as a term of reproach upon the inhabitants of Me&s;&s;ina. Here while he entertained Hugh, duke of Burgundy, and a great number of French noblemen on Chri&s;tmas-day, he and his gue&s;ts were obliged to ri&s;e from table and quell a tumult, ari&s;ing from a quarrel between &s;ome Engli&s;h and Pi&s;an &s;ailors: but it was next day renewed, upon a Pi&s;an's murdering an Engli&s;hman at church: both &s;ides fought with equal fury, and many lives were lo&s;t, before the kings of France and England could advance with their forces, and put an end to the battle. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bened.

<P>In a few days after this di&s;turbance, a trifling incident &s;erved to de|note the impetuo&s;ity of Richard's di&s;po&s;ition. Having rode out to take the air, accompanied by &s;everal French and Engli&s;h knights, of which number was William de Barre, famous for his courage and dexterity, the king, who had formerly taken this cavalier in a &s;kirmi&s;h near Mante, perceiving a man leading an a&s;s loaden with canes, di&s;tributed the&s;e among the company, and they began to tilt at one another in the Moori&s;h manner. In the cour&s;e of this pa&s;time Wil|liam happened to tear the king's coat; and Richard incen&s;ed at the pre&s;umption of a man who had formerly broke his parole with him in Normandy, ran at him with great fury; but, in&s;tead of di&s;mounting William, his own &s;addle gave way, and he came to the ground: a circum&s;tance which piqued the king's pride to &s;uch a degree, that he ordered de Barre to be gone, and never appear again in his pre&s;ence. At the interce&s;&s;ion, however, of the prelates and nobility, he was permitted to pro&s;ecute the voyage to the Holy-Land, where he &s;ignalized<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vine&s;auf.</NOTE> his valour in &s;uch a manner, as effectually retrieved the favour of Richard.</P>

<P>Mean while the French king di&s;gui&s;ed his animo&s;ity &s;o well, that the other never &s;u&s;pected his &s;entiments; but treated him as a particular friend and generous ally. He pre&s;ented Philip with divers Engli&s;h &s;hips, and half the money he had received from Tancred; and di&s;tributed his trea&s;ure among the French knights with &s;uch profu&s;ion, that he is &s;aid to have given away in one month more than any of his predece&s;&s;ors had be&s;towed in a whole year. At length he vi&s;ited the Sicilian king at Catanea, who received him with parti|cular marks of honour and re&s;pect, and was &s;o plea&s;ed with his open, frank de|meanor, that he made him acquainted with Philip's malevolence. This plainly appeared in a letter from the king of France to Tancred, a&s;&s;uring him, that Richard intended to deprive him of his crown; and propo&s;ing that the Sicilian &s;hould fall upon him &s;uddenly with his forces, in which ca&s;e he would &s;econd his attempt. The Engli&s;h monarch was confounded at this in&s;tance of $erfidy; the truth of which he had no rea&s;on to doubt, when he &s;aw Philip's &s;ignet, and Tancred offered to prove that he received it from the duke of Burgundy. He carefully pre&s;erved this evidence, and having been &s;plendidly entertained by the Sicilian monarch, to whom he pre&s;ented the famous &s;word of Arthur, celebrated under the name of Caliburne, he returned to Me&s;&s;ina with a hearty contempt of his French ally. Philip could not help perceiving a total alteration in his be|haviour, and &s;ent the count of Flanders to expo&s;tulate with him on the &s;ubject,

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1191.</NOTE> Richard had never been affianced to this prince&s;s, and never expre&s;&s;|ed the lea&s;t inclination for the match, except when his intention was to di&s;tre&s;s his father; for his heart had been captivated by the beauty of Berengaria, daugh|ter of Sanchez, king of Navarre, and he had already employed his mother Eleanor to make a journey into Guienne, and negociate a marriage between him and that amiable prince&s;s. The propo&s;al was immediately embraced, and the contract being ratified, the queen-mother and her future daughter-in-law tra|velled over land to Naples, having been joined on the road by the count of Flan|ders: they were thence conveyed to Brindi&s;i, becau&s;e Me&s;&s;ina, being already crouded, could not contain them with their numerous retinue. Philip was perfectly well acquainted with all the&s;e tran&s;actions, and threatened loudly to renounce all friend&s;hip with the king of England; but the di&s;pute was compromi&s;ed in an|other treaty; by which Richard was relea&s;ed from all pretended engagements to Adelais, who afterwards married William II. count of Ponthieu, who was the principal ho&s;tage given by Philip for his performance of articles. The French king ceded Gi&s;ors, Naufle, Neufchatel de S. Denys, and the Vexin Normand, to Richard, and the heirs male of his body; in default of which they &s;hould re|vert to Philip, and in ca&s;e of his death without i&s;&s;ue male, be re-united with the domain of Normandy: they agreed that Richard's elde&s;t &s;on, if heaven &s;hould ble&s;s him with male offspring, &s;hould hold the Norman dominions of Philip in capite; that the Engli&s;h king &s;hould pay ten thou&s;and marks of &s;ilver, at four different payments; and cede the fiefs Y&s;&s;adun and Gra&s;&s;ay, with all that was claimed in Auvergne by the king of France, who, on his &s;ide, &s;hould yield to Rich|ard, Cahors and Qu$r$y, except the two royal abbies of Figeac and Souillac.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> The treaty being &s;igned and ratified, the king of France took his de|parture from Me&s;&s;ina for the Holy Land, and Richard gave him a &s;hort con|voy with his gal$ies; then tacking about to Reggio, took on board his mother and Berengaria, with whom he returned that &s;ame evening to the place from whence he had &s;et &s;ail: Eleanor, in a few days, embarked on her return for England, and the prince&s;s of Navarre remained with Richard's &s;i&s;ter Jane, dowager of Si|cily, until he could a&s;&s;emble a&s;ufficient number of ve&s;&s;els for the tran&s;portation of his cavalry. The&s;e being procured, and every other nece&s;&s;ary prepared, he demoli&s;hed the fort of Mate-Griffon, and &s;ailed from Me&s;&s;ina with above two hundred &s;hips and gallies. In two days the fleet was di&s;per&s;ed in a $&s;torm, and the king obliged to put into the isle of Crete, from whence he &s;teered to Rhodes: while two of his large &s;hips were &s;tranded on the coa&s;t of Cyprus, and Roger, his vice-chancellor, drowned, with &s;everal knights and their atten|dants. Tho&s;e who reached the &s;hore were immediately &s;eized, &s;tripped, and impri&s;oned by I&s;aac, &s;tiling him&s;elf emperor of Cyprus, who would not &s;uf|fer a third ve&s;&s;el, having on board the queen of Sicily and Berengaria, to enter the harbour of Lime&s;ol. Richard being informed of their di&s;tre&s;s, advanced to their relief with his gallies, and found them lying at anchor on the open &s;hore, expo&s;ed to all the extremity of the weather. Incen&s;ed at the barbarity of this in|&s;olent

tyrant, he &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to demand his pilgrims, with all their effects which had been &s;eized; and, receiving an arrogant an&s;wer, immediately landed his men. I&s;aac did not decline an engagement, in which he was defeated; the town &s;oon capitulated, and the fleet was brought into the harbour. The Cypriots rea&s;&s;embled another body of forces, and, giving battle the next day to Richard, were routed again with great &s;laughter. This overthrow determined the fate of the i&s;land. All the ca&s;tles and towns admitted the conqueror, and I&s;aac him&s;elf &s;ubmitted at di&s;cretion. The conque&s;t of Cyprus being &s;o ea&s;ily atchieved, the king e&s;pou&s;ed Berengaria, who was crowned the &s;ame day at Lime&s;ol, by John bi&s;hop of Evreux, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the archbi&s;hops of Apamea and Auch, and the bi&s;hop of Bayonne. After this ceremony Richard received the homage of the nobility, and confirmed the laws, cu&s;toms, and privileges of the Cypriots, who having been oppre&s;&s;ed by I&s;aac, hailed the king of England as their deliverer. Nor was their gratitude confined to empty profe&s;&s;ions; they pre&s;ented him<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vine&s;auf. Benedict.

<P>Having regulated the affairs of Cyprus, and be&s;towed the govern|ment of the i&s;land upon Richard de Camville and Robert de Turnham, the king &s;et &s;ail for Acon, whither he had already di&s;patched the two queens and I&s;aac's on|ly daughter, with the be&s;t part of his fleet and forces. In his pa&s;&s;age he encoun|tered a prodigious large ve&s;&s;el, equipped by Saladine at Barut, containing fifteen hundred of his choice troops, commanded by &s;even admirals, and loaden with provi&s;ion and warlike &s;tores, for the garri&s;on of Acon. This huge un|weildy &s;hip he attacked and de&s;troyed, and arrived before the place, to the in|expre&s;&s;ible joy of the Chri&s;tian army, and the terror and di&s;may of the be&s;ieged, which increa&s;ed, even to de&s;pair, when they under&s;tood the lo&s;s of the ve&s;&s;el, in which all their hopes were centered. The &s;iege, which had hitherto langui&s;hed, was now carried on with &s;urpri&s;ing vigour. Richard's courage, liberality, and magnificence, not only engaged the hearts of the &s;oldiery, but totally eclip&s;ed the king of France, who became envious of his glory, and jealous of his great|ne&s;s. Though Richard had &s;hared with him the booty and pri&s;oners taken in the carrack, according to a convention made in Sicily, by which they agreed to divide the &s;poils of the infidels, Philip was not contented; but laid claim to one half of Cyprus, and the riches there acquired. To this demand Richard replied, that though their agreement related to Pale&s;tine only, he would divide his conque&s;t with Philip, provided that prince would act in the &s;ame manner towards him, with regard to the dominions and effects of the count of Flan|ders, and the Ca&s;tillan of St. Omers, lately decea&s;ed, who&s;e effects he had &s;eized for his own advantage. This an&s;wer effectually &s;ilenced the French king, who dropped his preten&s;ions; and they renewed their agreement about the acqui&s;itions that &s;hould be made in the Holy Land, appointing the Knights Templars and Ho&s;pitallers as umpires of the partition. By this time the be|&s;ieged<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gul. Neu|brig.</NOTE> were reduced to extremity, and Saladine finding it impracticable to rai&s;e the &s;iege, allowed them to &s;urrender, upon the be&s;t terms they could procure: the capitulation they obtained did not even &s;ecure their lives; for they obliged them&s;elves to remain in cu&s;tody until their heads &s;hould be redeemed with two hundred thou&s;and Byzantines, and in failure of this ran&s;om, within a certain time, they were to be at the mercy of the conquerors. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoved:</NOTE></P>

<P>The city being &s;urrendered, and Philip having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his &s;hare, according to the determination of the arbitrators, he de&s;ired Richard would con&s;ent to his return, as the air of A&s;ia did not agree with his con&s;titu|tion, and he &s;hould certainly die unle&s;s re&s;t$red to his own country. Under this pretext he harboured the de&s;ign of making him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Flanders, and perhaps of invading Normandy. All the princes of the army exclaimed again&s;t his de&s;erting them before the cru&s;ade &s;hould be fini&s;hed; but he per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;olution, and renewed his demand upon Cyprus, which he thought Richard would buy off with his con&s;ent to Philip's retreat. Accordingly he became &s;o importunate on both &s;ubjects, that the king of England granted his reque&s;t, upon his taking a public oath on the evangeli&s;ts, that he would ab&s;tain from all ho&s;tilities again&s;t the territories of Richard, and even protect them again&s;t all invaders to the utmost of his power. Having thus quieted the apprehen&s;ions of his rival, who accommodated him with two of his be&s;t gallies, he &s;e$ $ail from Acon, leaving his troops under the command of the duke of Burgundy; and, in his pa&s;&s;age through Italy, complained to pope Cele&s;tine III. that he could not act in concert with Richard, who&s;e in&s;olence was altogether intolera|ble: he therefore de&s;ired his ho$ine&s;s would ab$olve him of his original vow, which he had not performed, as well as of the oath he had &s;worn to the king of England, that he might revenge him&s;elf upon that haughty prince. The pope gratified him in the fir&s;t part of his demand, but forbade him to invade the territories of Richard, on pain of excommunication, a prohibition which he had<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> already re&s;olved to di&s;regard.</P>

<P>After Philip's departure, the whole charge of the war devolved up|on Richard, who found him&s;elf in a very perplexed &s;ituation, occa&s;ioned by the conte&s;t between Guy de Luzignan and Conrade, marquis of Montferrat, about the crown of Jeru&s;alem: an accommodation had been effected by the in|terpo&s;ition of the other princes, and it was agreed, that Guy &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the kingdom for life; that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;hould $all to Conrade and his heirs; and that in the mean time they &s;hould equally &s;hare the revenues. Notwith&s;tanding this pacification, Conrade &s;till maintained a corre&s;pondence wit$ Saladine, and avoided a junction with the king of England, who having repaired the fort$fi|cations of Acon, began his march for Joppa, along the &s;ea-coa&s;t, for the con|venience of being &s;upplied with provi&s;ions by the &s;hipping. Saladine hovered with his army upon the mountains, ready to attack him with the fir&s;t favourable opportunity, and at length gave battle to the Chri&s;tians, as they pa&s;&s;ed a river in the neighbourhood of Cae&s;area. Here he was routed with the &s;laughter of for$y thou&s;and men, chiefly by the valour and conduct of Richard; and he forthwith ordered Cae&s;area, Joppa, and A&s;calon to be demoli&s;hed. The king of England, howeve$, repaired the fortifications of the two fir&s;t of the&s;e towns, and repeopled them with part of the inhabitants of Acon. Then he advanced towards Jeru&s;alem, and defeated Saladine again, in the plains of Rama; when he might have made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the city, had not he been diverted<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

whom he had left guardian of the realm. In&s;tead of co-operating with the bi&s;hop of Durham as his colleague, he had arre&s;ted the per&s;on of that prelate, who was obliged to purcha&s;e his relea&s;e by delivering into his hands the ca&s;tles of Wind&s;or, Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, the manor of Sadberg, with the county of Northumberland; and giving his own &s;on and Gilbert de la Ley as ho&s;tages for his quiet &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Hugh complained of this treatment in letters to the king, who received them at Mar&s;eilles, and &s;ent orders to William to re&s;tore the places he had wre&s;ted from the bi&s;hop; but he refu&s;ed to comply with the&s;e in&s;truc|tions, on pretence of knowing the king's mind better than it could be explained in writing, and he demeaned him&s;elf in all re&s;pects with the mo&s;t intolerable pride and arrogance. He expo&s;ed every thing to &s;ale with the mo&s;t &s;hameful venality: he deprived both clergy and laity of their churches, lands, and po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions, with which he enriched his own relations and dependants: he exhau&s;ted the king's revenue by m$king purcha&s;es for him&s;elf; in&s;omuch that he bought every e&s;tate that was to be &s;old: the vacant churches and abbeys he either kept for his own u&s;e, or be&s;towed on his own creatures, among whom likewi&s;e he di|&s;tributed ca&s;tles and po&s;ts, which he extorted from others by dint of menaces and per&s;ecution. In his vi&s;itation of the religious hou&s;es he travelled with a party of fifteen hundred hor&s;e, and &s;uch a retinue of knights, clergy, &s;ervants, min|&s;trels, dogs and hor&s;es, that the convent in which he lodged could &s;carcely, in three years, recover the damage &s;u&s;tained in one night's entertainment. The nobility truckled to him with the mo&s;t abject complai&s;ance, expre&s;&s;ing the ut|mo&s;t ambition to marry his nieces and relations, tho' like him&s;elf &s;prang from the dregs of the people; and even prince John was treated by him with &s;uch indig|nity, that he appealed to his brother for redre&s;s. In a word, the civil and lega|tine<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. Paris. G.

<P>Richard, tho' informed of the&s;e particulars from different corre&s;pond|ents, while he re&s;ided at Me&s;&s;ina, was &s;o bigotted to his own choice, that he would not depo&s;e this haughty viceroy; but di&s;patched Walter, archbi&s;hop of Rouen, and William Mare&s;chal earl of Strigul, with po&s;itive orders to the chan|cellor, implying that nothing &s;hould be done in the admini&s;tration without their advice, and that of the coun&s;ellors whom he had appointed before his departure: but, when they arrived, they dur&s;t not deliver their credentials; &s;o that Wil|liam pro$eeded in his u&s;ual career. Among other acts of arbitrary power, he dive&s;ted Gerard de Camville of the &s;heriffdom of Lincoln&s;hire, and commanded him to &s;urrender the ca&s;tle of which he was hereditary ca&s;tellan. When he re|fu&s;ed to comply with this order, the chancellor began his march with a body of troops to redu$e it by force; but, before he could atchieve the enterprize, he received a me&s;&s;age from prince John, threatning to vi&s;it him at the head of an army, if he would not in&s;tantly de&s;i&s;t from his undertaking; and this was followed by another piece of intelligence, which effectually damped his courage. He received information of the pope's death, in con&s;equence of which his legatine power vani&s;hed &s;o, that he found him&s;elf deprived o$ the be&s;t half of his authority; and, perceiving that the noblemen in his army were well affected towards prince John, he the more willingly lent an ear to propo&s;als of accommodation. This was<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bened. Abb.</NOTE> accordingly effect$d, on condition that William &s;hould retain the ca&s;tles and the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">G$$. Neubrig. Bened. Ab$.</NOTE> The cruel and arbitrary di&s;po&s;ition of this up&s;tart, appeared in no|thing more flagrant than in his behaviour towards the king's natural brother Geoffrey, in who&s;e &s;ervice he had lived, and to whom he was bound by an oath of homage and fealty. That prelate had appointed him his official in the archdeaconry of Rouen, even contrary to the inclination of the late king, who always regarded Longchamp as a perfidious mi&s;creant. Geoffrey had been for &s;ome time elect of York; but Baldwin of Canterbury claiming the prerogative of con&s;ecrating the archbi&s;hops of that &s;ee, and the other refu&s;ing to give up its independancy, the &s;uffragans were forbid to perform the ceremonies of con&s;e|cration, and the temporalities were sequestered in the hands of the chancellor. When queen Eleanor parted with her &s;on Richard in Sicily, the king de&s;ired her to &s;olicit pope Cele&s;tine for the confirmation of Geoffrey's election: and that pontiff had ordered the archbi&s;hop of Tours to perform the office of his con&s;ecration, immediately after which he received the pall with a bull of privi|lege, exempting the &s;ee of York from the juri&s;diction of all legates, except tho&s;e who &s;hould be &s;ent occa&s;ionally into England a latere. Thus confirmed, Geoffrey proceeded for Wit&s;and, in order to embark for England; but, when he reached the ca&s;tle of Gui&s;nes, he under&s;tood that the counte&s;s of Flanders had, at the de&s;ire of Longchamp, given orders to prevent his pa&s;&s;age. As this re&s;triction did not extend to his retinue, they were &s;ent over in a Bologne &s;hip; and he him&s;elf going on board of a &s;mall Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el, landed at Dover, where he was immediately taken into cu&s;tody by the chancellor's directions. He made &s;hift, however, to e&s;cape from the party by which he had been arre&s;ted, and took refuge in the church of St. Martin, a privileged place belonging to the monks of Canterbury. Here he was inve&s;ted by a body of Brabantines, who at length dragged him in his ponti&s;icals from the altar, and impri&s;oned him in the ca&s;tle, after they had plundered his baggge and &s;ent his hor&s;es to the chan|cellor.</P>

<P>The whole nation exclaimed again&s;t this unprovoked violence, offered to the per&s;on of an archbi&s;hop who was univer&s;ally beloved. The bi&s;hop of Lincoln excommunicated all concerned in the outrage, a &s;entence which was afterwards confirmed by the re&s;t of the prelates at Reading, where prince John, commonly &s;tiled count of Mortaign, &s;ummoned a general a&s;&s;embly. He had likewi&s;e e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of Geoffrey; and the bi&s;hops of London, Coven|try, and Norwich, threatened the land with an interdict, in ca&s;e of his being de|tained in pri&s;on; &s;o that Longchamp thought proper to &s;et him at liberty, and he repaired with the other prelates to Reading. Here Walter, archbi&s;hop of Rouen, read the king's letters appointing him to &s;uperintend the election for filling up the &s;ee of Canterbury, and with his colleagues to a&s;&s;i&s;t William in the admini&s;tration. As the chancellor had prevented the vacancy from being filled, he refu&s;ed to admit him and his colleagues into his councils, in dia|metrical oppo&s;ition to the king's plea&s;ure; oppre&s;&s;ed the people, and, in parti|cular, treated the archbi&s;hop of York with &s;uch indignity; he propo&s;ed that Longchamp &s;hould be depo&s;ed from the government, according to the tenour of the king's letters, which he produced; and William, then re&s;iding at Wind|&s;or,

was &s;ummoned to meet them the next day at Lodbridge, between that place and Reading. William promi&s;ed to meet them at the appointed rendezvous, and had actually proceeded two or three miles with an armed force, when his heart failing him, he took the road to London and &s;hut him&s;elf up in the Tower, the fortifications of which he him&s;elf had repaired: but being inve&s;ted by the nobility and citizens before he could &s;upply the place with a &s;ufficient &s;tore of provi&s;ions, he endeavoured to engage prince John in his intere&s;t by dint of magnificent promi&s;es. That expedient mi&s;carrying, he was forced to &s;ubmit to the judgment of the prelates and nobility, who, after a full hearing, depriv|ed him of his po&s;ts and ca&s;tles, except tho&s;e of Dover, Cambridge, and Here|ford, which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed before the king's departure; and the places of chancel|lor and ju&s;ticiary were &s;upplied by the archbi&s;hop of Rouen, a prelate of uncom|mon abilities and untainted integrity. William, unwilling to part with the ca&s;tles which he had u&s;urped, retired to Dover, from whence he endeavoured to make his e&s;cape beyond &s;ea, in woman's apparel; but, being detected by the populace, to whom he had rendered him&s;elf extremely odious, they treated him with great indignity, and, at la&s;t, confined him to a dark cellar. The archbi&s;hop of Rouen pitying his condition, &s;ent an order to relea&s;e him, with a licence to leave the kingdom, in con&s;equence of which he cro&s;&s;ed over to Normandy, where he was<NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

<P>He no &s;ooner arrived on the continent, than he &s;ollicited pope Ce|le&s;tine to renew his legation, and complained in letters to his holine&s;s, and the king, that he had been deprived of the admini&s;tration by the faction of John, count de Mortaign, who had a de&s;ign upon the kingdom. The pope, believing his remon&s;trances, appointed him legate of England, and ordered the bi&s;hops of the realm to excommunicate the count and all that were concerned in the pri|vation of Longchamp. Of the&s;e William &s;ent over a li&s;t to Hugh, bi&s;hop of Lincoln, together with the pope's mandates; which, however, no prelate would execute. On the contrary, the ju&s;ticiaries &s;eized all the rents of the &s;ee of Ely, in the king's name, as &s;ome sort of &s;atisfaction for two years royal rev&eacute;nue which he had embezzled. Mean while he found means to purcha&s;e John's favours, and re&s;olved to repair to England with his legatine dignity. He accordingly took &s;hipping and landed at Dover, from whence he &s;ent me&s;&s;engers to the queen-mother to notify his legation and arrival. A council was immediately a&s;&s;embled, and John di&s;covered his partiality in &s;uch a manner as &s;candalized Eleanor, who reprimanded him publicly for his attachment to &s;uch a villain. It was judged proper, however, to take off the edge of this attachment with a &s;ub&s;idy of two thou&s;and marks from the Exchequer; then the prince viewed the matter in a different light; and it was unanimou&s;ly decreed that an appeal &s;hould be made to the pope again&s;t the legation of Longchamp, who was order|ed to quit the kingdom immediately as a di&s;turber of the public peace. Wil|liam, being informed of this determination, laid his own dioce&s;e under interdict, and returned in great confu&s;ion to Normandy, where he exerted all his endeavours<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bened.

<P>Philip the French king, immediately after his return from Pale&s;tine, propo&s;ed a conference with William Fitzralph, &s;ene&s;chal of Normandy, and the prelates and nobility of that dukedom; a conference was accordingly held in
<PB N="394" REF="4030">
the u&s;ual place, where he demanded his &s;i&s;ter Adelais, with the ca&s;tle of Gi&s;ors and the counties of Eu and Aumale, which he pretended were ceded to him by the treaty of Meffina. The Normans replied, that they had no orders on that &s;ubject, and therefore could not comply with his demand: he threatned to do him&s;elf ju&s;tice by force of arms; and they made preparations for a vigorous defence. Baffled in this project, he tampered with John, count de Mortaign, whom he invited to a conference, offering to be&s;tow upon him his &s;i&s;ter Ade|lais in marriage, and to put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all Richard's dominions on the continent immediately after the &s;olemnization of the nuptials. John was ripe for any de&s;ign again&s;t Richard, who had declared Arthur his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, not only in his treaty with Tancred, but in letters to Longchamp, who entred into a ne|gotiation with William king of Scotland in order to &s;ecure this &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. That prelate now changed his party, and employed all his addre&s;s to corroborate the propo&s;als of Philip, which John embraced without he&s;itation, and was on the point of cro&s;&s;ing the &s;ea in compliance with Philip's invitation; when his depar|ture was prevented by the remon&s;trances of the queen-mother, together with the menaces of the ju&s;ticiaries, who threatened to &s;eize all his lands and ca&s;tles &s;hould he pre&s;ume to leave the kingdom. At the &s;ame time, all the prelates and nobility were &s;ummoned to London, where they renewed their oath of fealty to Richard; a circum&s;tance which greatly damped the hopes which John had con|ceived. The French king, di&s;appointed in this quarter, formed the de&s;ign of invading Normandy; but his nobility would not join him in &s;uch an expedition, contrary to the oath they had taken. The pope had &s;ent Octavian, bi&s;hop of O&s;tia and Jordan, abbot of Fo&s;&s;a Nova, as his legates to compromi&s;e the dif|ference between the archbi&s;hop of Rouen and William Longchamp; but the &s;ene&s;chal of Normandy would not allow them to enter the dutchy, which, during the pilgrimage of the king, was exempted from all legatine juri&s;diction. Tho' Octavian, at the de&s;ire of Philip, excommunicated this officer and all his abettors, and laid the dominions under an interdict; Jordano refu&s;ed to join in the&s;e cen&s;ures, and for that rea&s;on was expelled from the territories of France; but his conduct was approved by the pope, who repealed the &s;entences, and re|fu&s;ed<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>The factions of Guy de Luzignan and Conrade divided the Chri&s;|tians in &s;uch a manner, that no effectual &s;ervice could be performed again&s;t the Saracens; and there was no other pro&s;pect of union, than that of Conrade's elevation to the throne of Jeru&s;alem; but, as Guy could not be expect|ed to re&s;ign his kingdom without an equivalent, Richard generou&s;ly pre|&s;ented him with the crown of Cyprus, which was enjoyed by him and his de|&s;cendants. This expedient removed all ob&s;tacles to an accommodation, and Conrade being perfectly well &s;atisfied with his fortune, re&s;olved to join the cru|&s;ards without further delay, when he was &s;tabbed in the &s;treets of Tyre by two a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, who for this purpo&s;e had in&s;inuated them&s;elves into his &s;ervice. They were &s;ubjects of a petty Saracen prince, who&s;e territories lay in the mountains of Phoenicia, and who was known by the name of the old Man of the Moun|tain. He was an artful prince who knew very well how to turn the &s;uper&s;tition of Mahomet to his own advantage. As he could not defend him&s;elf from the encroachments of his powerful neighbours, by open force, he contrived an ef|fectual
<PB N="395" REF="4040">
method to revenge the injuries he &s;hould &s;u&s;tain. He maintained a band of enthu&s;ia&s;ts, who implicitly obeyed his orders, tho' hedged with the mo&s;t im|minent danger, in full per&s;ua&s;ion, that &s;hould they die in the execution, Para|di&s;e would be their recompence. The&s;e he di&s;patched occa&s;ionally to murder tho&s;e princes who had done him wrong: and they pur&s;ued their aim with in|credible fortitude and per&s;everance; &s;o that all the potentates of that part of A&s;ia, were afraid of giving umbrage to the lord of the mountain. One of his &s;ubjects being driven by &s;tormy weather into the harbour of Tyre, was plun|dered and &s;lain by order of Conrade. The Scheic, or old man, demanded &s;atisfac|tion, and the blame was laid upon Reginald, lord of Sidon. This charge was examined, and found fal&s;e by the Scheic, who &s;ent another me&s;&s;enger for redre&s;s to Conrade, who not only refu&s;ed to do ju&s;tice, but was, with difficulty, re&s;trained from putting the me&s;&s;enger to death. In revenge for this outrage, the a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;ins were di&s;patched with in&s;tructions to murder the offender, and executed their orders with great deliberation. Being apprehended, they avowed the com|mand of their lord, who afterwards &s;ent a letter or manife&s;to to the European<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vine&s;auf. Neubrig. Rymer's Foe|dera.</NOTE> princes, explaining and ju&s;tifying his conduct, and clearing Richard from the imputation of being concerned in this murder, which had been fixed upon his character by his enemies. Conrade was &s;ucceeded in the throne by Henry, count of Champagne, who married his widow, and marched to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Rich|ard, who had ju&s;t reduced the &s;trong fortre&s;s of Darum, in the plains of Pale&s;|tine. Thus reinforced, he began his march to Jeru&s;alem, which he re&s;olved to be&s;iege; but, when they approached the city, the &s;iege was judged impractica|ble, from the difficulty of receiving &s;upplies of provi&s;ion; and the duke of Burgundy retreated with the French troops to Tyre, from whence he propo&s;ed to embark for Europe. The Engli&s;h troops being dimini&s;hed by continual fa|tigues and repeated engagements, all hope of making new conque&s;ts vani&s;hed, and Richard having received divers letters from the regency, &s;olliciting his im|mediate return to prevent the di&s;orders that threatned his kingdom, he re&s;olved to take his leave of Pale&s;tine, in which he had enacted miracles of valour to the terror and admiration of the infidels. Saladine &s;till commanded a va&s;t ar|my among the mountains, ready to fall upon the maritime towns as &s;oon as the king of England &s;hould quit the country; and accordingly Richard, on his arrival at Acon, under&s;tood that the town of Joppa was taken, and the ca&s;tle reduced to extremity. He no &s;ooner received this intelligence, than he order|ed his forces to march thither by land, while he him&s;elf with a handful of troops was tran&s;ported by &s;ea, and compelled the Saracens to rai&s;e the &s;iege, by the terror of his name, and a &s;eries of the mo&s;t daring exploits in which he expo&s;ed his per&s;on to the utmo&s;t danger. As he could not, however, remain in Pale&s;|tine, with any regard to his own intere&s;t, or, indeed, with any pro&s;pect of ac|compli&s;hing the great aim of the expedition, he agreed upon a truce of three years with Saladine, on condition that A&s;calon &s;hould be demoli&s;hed; that the Chri&s;tians &s;hould fortify Joppa, and inhabit all the places on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, while the Saracens &s;hould remain in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hilly country. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dueto Coll.</NOTE></P>

<P>The&s;e &s;tipulations being ratified, and the affairs of Pale&s;tine &s;ettled in the be&s;t manner the circum&s;tance of the times would permit, Richard returned to Acon, where he embarked for Europe. Not caring to pa&s;s through France, or the territories of Tholou&s;e, he directed his cour&s;e to Ragu&s;a, from whence
<PB N="396" REF="4050">
he determined to travel incognito through Germany; but, being di&s;covered in a village near Vienna, he was di&s;covered by Leopold, duke of Au&s;tria, who, glad of this opportunity to revenge an affront which he had &s;u&s;tained from Richard at Acon, ordered him to be arre&s;ted and loaded with &s;hackles, to the di&s;grace of honour and humanity. His avarice was, in all probability, as much con|cerned as his revenge in this ungenerous in&s;ult; for he expected a &s;hare of the ran&s;om, and even &s;tipulated for the &s;um of fifty thou&s;and marks, when he deli|vered him to the emperor Henry VI. who received the prize in a tran&s;port of joy, tho' the two nations were at peace with one another, and he could not find the &s;lighte&s;t pretence for detaining a prince who&s;e per&s;on ought to have been held &s;acred, con&s;idering the &s;ervice he had done to the chri&s;tian cau&s;e in Pale&s;|tine.

<P>Philip of France being informed of Richard's captivity, renewed all his offers to John, count of Mortaign; and &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to Canute V. king of Denmark, to demand his &s;i&s;ter Ingeburga in marriage, de&s;iring no other portion with that prince&s;s, than an a&s;&s;ignment of Canute's claim to England, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an armament in his endeavours to conquer that kingdom. The propo&s;al was accepted, and the lady married at Amiens to Phi|lip, who repudiated her the very next day, and a formal divorce was after|wards obtained on pretence of con&s;anguinity between this prince&s;s and Philip's former queen. This affront, in all probability, detached the Danes from the in|tere&s;t of the French king, who derived no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from that quarter; tho' prince John embarked in his mea&s;ures without he&s;itation, and cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea in order to confer more intimately with his ally. The &s;ene&s;chal and barons of the dutchy, having no &s;u&s;picion of his de&s;igns, invited him to a conference at An|jou, to con&s;ult about his brother's ran&s;om, and the defence of the dominions threatened by the French monarch; but he gave them to under&s;tand, that he would not concur in any mea&s;ures again&s;t Philip, unle&s;s they would &s;wear feal|ty to him as their &s;overeign; and this propo&s;al they ab&s;olutely rejected. He forthwith engaged in a treaty with the king of France, who agreed to give him his &s;i&s;ter Adelais in marriage, with the county of Artois, which had lately de|volved to France at the death of the count of Flanders, and John, in return, ceded to him all Normandy north of the Seine, except Rouen and &s;everal other places, and did homage for all his brother's foreign dominions; this con|tract<NOTE PLACE="marg">P.

<P>Philip having found his nobility &s;o aver&s;e to this expedition, when it was la&s;t propo&s;ed, had recour&s;e to a low artifice, by which he per&s;uaded them to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the execution of his &s;cheme. He affected to be afraid of his per|&s;on, rai&s;ed a company of life-guards armed with brazen maces, and would not allow any &s;tranger to appear in his pre&s;ence; having excited the wonder and cu|rio&s;ity of his &s;ubjects by this &s;trange alteration in his demeanour, he called an a&s;&s;embly of his peers at Paris, and expre&s;&s;ed his apprehen&s;ions of being a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nated by the emi&s;&s;aries of Richard, who he affirmed was the projector of Con|rade's
<PB N="397" REF="4060">
death; and, not contented with that murder, had hired a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins in the ea&s;t to di&s;patch him in the mid&s;t of his court at Paris. The wi&s;er part of the a&s;&s;embly doubted the truth of the imputation, and advi&s;ed that no ho&s;tilities &s;hould be committed again&s;t the dominions of the king of England, until that prince &s;hould return, as he &s;till wore the badge of the cru&s;ade; and an inva|&s;ion of his territories in his ab&s;ence, would not only &s;candalize all chri&s;tian powers, but al&s;o &s;ubject the invaders to the pope's cen&s;ure. This opinion was over-ruled by the majority of the council; and Philip entered Normandy at the head of a numerous army. As he and John carried on an intelligence with &s;ome barons of the country, he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Gi&s;ors and &s;everal &s;trong places, without oppo&s;ition; the governors not only betrayed their tru&s;t, but joined the enemy, who reduced the counties of Eu and Aumale, by trea|chery, and, advancing to Rouen, &s;ummoned the inhabitants to &s;urrender on pain of being put to the &s;word. The citizens, encouraged by the pre&s;ence of Ro|bert earl of Leice&s;ter, ju&s;t returned from Pale&s;tine, where he had &s;ignalized his valour in a very extraordinary manner, de&s;pi&s;ed the threats of Philip, and obliged him to rai&s;e the &s;iege, after he had been repul&s;ed in various a&s;&s;aults. He had met with indifferent &s;ucce&s;s in a negotiation with the emperor, whom he offered to bribe with a large &s;um of money, if he would deliver his va&s;&s;al Richard into his hands; but this &s;candalous contract was oppo&s;ed by the princes of the empire. The pope threatened to excommunicate Philip, and lay his kingdom under an interdict, if he would not immediately withdraw his troops from Normandy; and John had not &s;ucceeded according to his expectation in England. The&s;e concurring rea&s;ons induced the French king to hearken to the propo&s;als for a truce, which he granted, on condition that he &s;hould re|ceive twenty thou&s;and marks at different payments, to commence after Rich|ard's relea&s;e; and, in the mean time, be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of certain ca&s;tles by<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

<P>John had carried over to England a great number of foreigners, and expected a further reinforcement of French and Flemings: at his landing he &s;eized the ca&s;tles of Wind&s;or and Wallingford; and, pretending his brother was dead, required Walter, archbi&s;hop of Rouen, and the other ju&s;ticiaries, to take the oath of allegiance, and proceed to his coronation. The regency giving no credit to his a&s;&s;ertion, he &s;ollicited the nobility for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, fortified his ca&s;tles, and ravaged the deme&s;nes of his brother. The ju&s;ticiaries hearing his auxiliaries were ready to embark at Wit&s;and, ordered bodies of troops to march down to the &s;ea-&s;ide, and &s;ecured the ports in &s;uch a manner, that the merce|naries dur&s;t not venture to attempt a de&s;cent. They rai&s;ed another army, with which they be&s;ieged and took Wind&s;or. A third body was a&s;&s;embled in the North by Geoffrey, archbi&s;hop of York; the ca&s;tle of Tikehill was inve&s;ted by Hugh, bi&s;hop of Durham; and John, finding him&s;elf unable to cope with the power and authority of the regents, was fain to purcha&s;e a truce by giving up the ca&s;tles of Pec and Wallingford. During this ce&s;&s;ation, John withdrew into France, and Hubert Walter, bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury, arriving in England with letters of recommendation to the king, was, by the unanimous &s;uffrages of the bi&s;hops and monks, elected archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. This prelate was left<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr.

<P>Richard had been cruelly treated at his detention by a brutal prince devoid of honour and humanity, and by him delivered into the hands of the emperor, who was a very proper patron to countenance &s;uch barbarity and ba&s;ene&s;s. As the captive prince did not know to what extremities he might be reduced, and what conde&s;cen&s;ions he might be obliged to make, he wrote to the archbi&s;hop of Rouen, to obey no orders that &s;hould come from him, if they &s;eemed contrary to his honour and the good of the nation. At la&s;t, by the mediation of the princes of the empire, his ran&s;om was fixed in the diet of Worms, at one hundred and fifty thou&s;and marks of &s;ilver; and it was determined that he &s;hould be &s;et at liberty, on paying two thirds of that &s;um, and giving ho&s;tages for the remainder. Hubert, lately e&s;tabli&s;hed in the &s;ee of Canterbury, had attended the king in Pale&s;tine, and hearing of his di&s;a&s;ter, vi&s;ited him in his captivity; by this prelate he &s;ent a commi&s;&s;ion to rai&s;e money for his ran&s;om, and find ho&s;tages for the &s;ecurity of the la&s;t payment. Every military tenant was, by the feudal law, and the nature of his tenure, obliged to give aid for the ran&s;om of his lord from captivity. This &s;occage was accordingly rai&s;ed in England$ together with a talliage or hydage upon cities, boroughs and manors, belonging to the crown, or in the king's hands, by e&s;cheat. The&s;e taxes were a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the itinerant ju&s;tices; but, be&s;ides the&s;e, great &s;ums were rai&s;ed from the voluntary contributions of the people zealous for their king's relea&s;e. The parochial clergy granted one tenth of their tythes; the bi&s;hops, abbots, and nobility, freely parted with a fourth of their income; the Ce&s;ter|tians gave up all their revenue of wool for one year; the pari&s;hes melted down their &s;acred chalices; and the cathedrals and mona&s;teries &s;old their plate and trea&s;ures to the amount of thirty thou&s;and marks, on a promi&s;e of being reim|bur&s;ed after the king's return.</P>

<P>The king of France was very much mortified when he heard of the agreement touching the ran&s;om of Richard; and tampered with the em|peror to renounce the treaty. He propo&s;ed an interview at Vaucoleurs, where he offered to marry the daughter of Henry his uncle, the count Palatine, and to gratify him with a &s;um equal to the ran&s;om, if he would find &s;ome pre|text for detaining Richard even but another year. Henry was very well in|clined to this expedient, which, tho' perfidious to the la&s;t degree, flattered his avarice, to which he &s;acrificed every other con&s;ideration: but he was afraid of incurring the re&s;entment of the princes by whom Richard was beloved, and con|tinued fluctuating between different motives equally &s;ordid, until the day fixed<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1194.</NOTE> for the deliverance of Richard. This was performed with great ceremony at Mentz, in pre&s;ence of the German nobility; and the archbi&s;hop of Rouen, with the other ho&s;tages, were produced when the king was &s;et at liberty. Richard, however, had no &s;ooner taken the road to Cologn and Antwerp, than the em|peror, who could not bear the pro&s;pect of lo&s;ing the prize which Phi ip of|fered for his further detention, re&s;olved to take him again into cu&s;tody, and &s;ent immediate orders for &s;topping him at the port of Swyne, where he in|tenked to embark for England. Richard, apprized of the negotiation between Philip and Henry, had &s;ent for &s;hips from England, which he found waiting for him at the mouth of the Scheld, but the wind proving contrary, he would, in all probability, have been taken, had not a friend at the emperor's court &s;ent him advice of his danger. He, upon this notice, went ha&s;tily on board,
<PB N="399" REF="4080">
and put to &s;ea immediately; and, a favourable gale &s;pringing up, he arrived in &s;afety at Sandwich. The emperor, chagrined at his di&s;appointment, exhau&s;ted his re&s;entment upon the ho&s;tages, who were confined and treated with uncom|mon rigour; and the king of France was &s;o enraged at Richard's e&s;cape, that<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dueto Col.

<P>Richard was received by the Londoners with great rejoicings, and &s;uch o&s;tentation of wealth, as amazed the German noblemen who accompanied him to England &s;o much that one of the number &s;aid he would have paid much dearer for his ran&s;om had the emperor known the affluence of his &s;ubjects. John, immediately before his brother's arrival, had &s;ent over from Norman|dy his chaplain Adam de S. Edmund, with orders to his adherents to fortify his ca&s;tles, and attack the enemy. This amba&s;&s;ador was &s;o vain of his com|mi&s;&s;ion, that he talked openly of the intimate corre&s;pondence between his ma&s;ter and the king of France; &s;o that, being apprehended, his papers di&s;covered all the de&s;igns of prince John and his confederates. A council being immediately a&s;&s;embled, orders were given by the ju&s;ticiaries to be&s;iege his ca&s;tles, di&s;&s;eize him of all his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and the bi&s;hops excommunicated him and all his ad|herents. His fortre&s;&s;es being &s;cattered over all parts of the kingdom, the no|blemen, and even the bi&s;hops levied forces in their different di&s;tricts to be&s;iege the&s;e haunts of rebellion. Marlborough, Lanca&s;ter, and St. Michael's mount, were &s;oon reduced; but Nottingham and Tikehill held out till the arrival of the king, who approved of the &s;teps which had been taken, and, after having re|po&s;ed him&s;elf three days at London, appeared in per&s;on before them, and both ca&s;tles &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE></P>

<P>Immediately after the reduction of the&s;e sorts, Richard convoked a general council at Nottingham, where he de&s;ired judgment again&s;t John count of Mortaign, and Hugh Novant bi&s;hop of Coventry, one of his abettors. The fir&s;t forfeited all his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and a proce&s;s was in&s;tituted again&s;t the other, both as bi&s;hop and high-&s;heriff of the county. In this council a tax cal|led Hidage was laid upon every plough-land throughout England; and a day fixed for the &s;econd coronation of the king at Winche&s;ter. This was per|formed on pretence of wiping out the &s;tain of captivity; but the real de&s;ign was to furni&s;h a handle for new$modelling the kingdom, re&s;uming the grants, and annulling the &s;ales which had been made before the king's departure. He alledged that the purcha&s;ers had already profit enough by their bargains, which were detrimental to the crown; and that &s;ubjects ought never to make an advantage of their king's nece&s;&s;ities. No body cho&s;e to di&s;pute the ju&s;tice of this re&s;umption. Hugh, bi&s;hop of Durham, re&s;igned the earldom of Northumberland; Godfrey, bi&s;hop of Winton, gave up the &s;heriffalty of Hamp&s;hire, the ca&s;tle of Winche&s;ter, and the manors he had purcha&s;ed before the expedition to Jeru&s;alem; and all the other grantees and purcha&s;ers follow|ed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoveden.

William, king of Scotland, cho&s;e this un&s;ea&s;onable juncture to &s;ollicit a grant of Northumberland, Cumberland, We&s;tmoreland, and Lan|ca&s;hire, on pretence that the&s;e counties had been enjoyed by his ance&s;tors; and, his petition being refu&s;ed, he offered fifteen hundred marks for the coun|ty of Northumberland alone. The king would have embraced the propo&s;al, with a re&s;ervation of the ca&s;tles; but William would not receive it on the&s;e

terms; and went away di&s;&s;atisfied, tho' not before he had obtained a charter entitling him to a certain &s;um to defray his expences in coming up to attend<NOTE PLACE="marg">G N$$brig.</NOTE> the great council of the kingdom.</P>

<P>Richard, having received con&s;iderable &s;ums from York and o|ther cities, by way of free-gift and congratulation on his return, and per&s;uaded the Ce&s;tertians to part with another &s;hearing, re&s;olved to vi&s;it his foreign do|minions, and oppo&s;e the progre&s;s of the French king, who had invaded his ter|ritories in concert with prince John and his rebellious &s;ubjects. He accord|ingly embarked at Port&s;mouth with a &s;trong body of forces in a fleet of one hundred &s;hips, and landing at Barfleur, proceeded to his palace of Bures, near Bayeux. Next morning his brother John appeared in his pre&s;ence, and throw|ing him&s;elf at his feet, implored his maje&s;ty's pardon, which was granted at the interce&s;&s;ion of the queen-mother; tho' no part of his e&s;tate was re&s;tored 'till the &s;ucceeding year, when he obtained the re&s;titution of the counties of Mortaigne and Glouce&s;ter, with the honour of Eye, and an annuity of eight thou|&s;and livres, in lieu of his other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. The king having appointed the ren|dezvous of his troops at L'Aigle, went thither and advanced immediately to the relief of Vernueil, which was be&s;ieged by Philip, to whom he re&s;olved to give battle. But that prince declined an engagement, and retired in the night with precipitation. The breaches were immediately repaired: he directed his march to Montmirail, which the Angevins had already taken and demoli&s;hed: from thence he repaired to Tours, where he received a free gift of two thou|&s;and marks from the citizens; and, marching forward to Loches, took the place by a&s;&s;ault. The king of France propo&s;ed a conference, and the place was fixed; but, while the Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners waited for the French depu|ties, Philip took the ca&s;tle of Fontaines near Rouen, and in his retreat &s;urpriz|ed the earl of Leice&s;ter in the neighbourhood of Gournay: he afterwards burned the town of Evreux, and then made a motion to Fretteval. In this place Richard re&s;olved to attack him, and advanced as far as Vendome; but, the French king not daring to &s;tand the &s;hock, retired in great confu&s;ion; &s;o that he was overtaken and routed with great &s;laughter by Richard, and narrowly e&s;caped with his life. All his baggage and trea&s;ure, his &s;eal and portable<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dueto Col.

<P>Immediately after this victory, the king marched with incredible ex|pedition into Guienne, again&s;t the count of Engoule&s;me and Geoffrey de Rancone, lord of Pons, who had rai&s;ed an in&s;urrection in favour of Philip. In &s;ixteen days, he reduced all their towns and ca&s;tles, and the number of his pri&s;oners amounted to three hundred knights, and forty thou&s;and &s;oldiers; &s;o that the revolters were obliged to &s;ubmit; and Philip &s;ued for a truce of three years; but as Richard would not agree to &s;uch a long ce&s;&s;ation, it was concluded for a &s;horter term,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch. 1194. G. Ne$brig.</NOTE> to be in force from the latter end of July, to the fea&s;t of All-&s;aints in the fol|lowing year. The king of England employed this interval in regulating his re|venue, which, he had rea&s;on to believe, was mi&s;managed and embezzled in his ab&s;ence. The itinerant ju&s;tices were directed to make a minute &s;crutiny into the deme&s;nes of the crown, the lands of wards, e&s;cheats, and forfeitures, as al&s;o into the wealth of the Jews, who were obliged, on pain of forfeiture and impri|&s;onment, to deliver true inventories of their e&s;tates; and all their pawns, bonds,
<PB N="401" REF="4100">
and &s;ecurities were lodged in a public office, in order to prevent their frauds and exorbitant u&s;ury. The &s;ame &s;crutiny was carried on in his foreign dominions. The officers of his revenue in Anjou and Maine were &s;everely fined for their mi&s;ma|nagement and corruption. William, bi&s;hop of Ely, was deprived of his office of chancellor, and a new great &s;eal being made, all charters were renewed, and the fees produced a con&s;iderable &s;um of money. Though the pope had lent a deaf ear to the remon&s;trances which were made by the prelates and nobility again&s;t the legatine power of Longchamp; his holine&s;s no &s;ooner under&s;tood that he was in di&s;grace with the king, than he &s;uper&s;eded his commi&s;&s;ion, and created Hubert, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, his legate over all the realm, notwith&s;tanding the exemption which the late pope had granted to the church of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diceto.</NOTE> York.</P>

<P>Richard, on the very day of his deliverance at Mentz, had di&s;|patched Salt de Breuil, with letters to Henry, king of Jeru&s;alem, importing, that he would certainly return to the Holy-Land, before the expiration of the truce with Saladine; and as the war was chiefly carried on in that country with cavalry, he indulged his &s;ubjects with the practice of tournaments, which had been for &s;ome time forbidden in England; becau&s;e he fore&s;aw, that this exer|ci&s;e would qualify them for the &s;ervice of the campaign. The&s;e diver&s;ions had been prohibited in England and &s;ome other countries, on account of the mi&s;chiefs which they had produced; for exclu&s;ive of accidents, which often befel the combatants, individuals, who entertained private animo&s;ity again&s;t each other, took this opportunity of deciding the contention, and fought to extre|mity, becau&s;e no puni&s;hment was adjudged again&s;t him who flew his antagoni&s;t in the tournament: for, the law &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;uch death was the effect of acci|dent. It was in an exerci&s;e of this kind, that Leopold, duke of Au&s;tria, &s;u&s;|tained a fall, in which his foot was cru&s;hed to pieces, a gangrene en&s;ued, and he &s;uffered amputation without &s;ucce&s;s. De&s;pairing of recovery, he de&s;ired he might be ab&s;olved of the &s;entence of excommunication, which the pope had fulminat|ed again&s;t him, for his cruelty and inju&s;tice to the king of England. Before he could obtain this favour, he was obliged to relea&s;e Richard of all conventions made during his captivity; he ordered the money, which he had received for his ran&s;om, to be re&s;tored, and the Engli&s;h ho&s;tages to be &s;et at liberty. His &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or was very unwilling to execute the&s;e beque&s;ts, and allowed his father's corp&s;e to he a whole week unburied, before he would relea&s;e the ho&s;tages: but the clergy refu&s;ing to perform the funeral rites, until the&s;e articles &s;hould be ful|filled, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them at la&s;t, and made them a tender of four thou&s;and marks to be re&s;tored to Richard: but they refu&s;ed to charge them&s;elves with &s;uch a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr.

<P>During Richard's captivity, the emperor had offered to him the kingdom of Provence, and the countries about the Rhone, which had for|merly been imperial fiefs, provided he would take the trouble to conquer them from France. Since that period, Henry had marched into Italy, and conquer|ed Apuglia, Calabria, and Sicily, of which he was crowned king, in right of his wife Con&s;tance. Upon his return from this fortunate expedition, he formed a plan for re-uniting to his &s;way, all the kingdoms and provinces which
<PB N="402" REF="4110">
formerly held of the we&s;tern empire; and, con&s;idering Richard as a nece&s;&s;ary ally towards the execution of this project, he &s;ent an emba&s;&s;y with the pre&s;ent of a golden crown to that prince, and the propo&s;al of an offen&s;ive and de$en&s;ive league again&s;t Philip, who had provoked the king of England by divers in|fractions of the truce, and even hired fifteen Saracens to take away his life. Richard had found very little benefit from the pen&s;ions he had paid to &s;ome German princes for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t France, and was dubious of Henry's &s;incerity: but that he might not, on bare &s;u&s;picion, avoid an advantageous al|liance, he &s;ent the bi&s;hop of Ely to found his real &s;entiments, and adju&s;t the particulars of the treaty. Philip, di&s;covering the&s;e tran&s;actions, endeavoured to intercept the bi&s;hop in his pa&s;&s;age; but, failing in the attempt, he declared that this corre&s;pondence was a breach of the truce, which he therefore renounc|ed; and made &s;everal incur&s;ions in Normandy, where he demoli&s;hed divers ca&s;tles, of which he had made him&s;elf ma&s;ter by treachery in the beginning of the war. Vaudreuil was on the point of undergoing the &s;ame fate, when Richard advanced with an army, and Philip, afraid of contending with him in the field, had recour&s;e as u&s;ual to a mean &s;tratagem: he amu&s;ed the king of England with a conference, while his engineers were privately employed in un|dermining the fortifications, which tumbled down all at once with a hideous cra&s;h. Richard, hearing the noi&s;e, was tran&s;ported with indignation; he &s;tarted up with fury in his a&s;pect, and putting him&s;elf at the head of his troops, at|tacked the French &s;o &s;uddenly, that they had &s;carcely time to retreat beyond the Seine. Philip was almo&s;t drowned, in pa&s;&s;ing a bridge which broke down with<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoveden.

<P>His progre&s;s was a little interrupted by the arrival of amba&s;&s;a|dors from the king of Ca&s;tile, who having been routed, and afterwards be|&s;ieged in Toledo by a va&s;t army of Moors, &s;ollicited the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the chri&s;|tian powers. Another negociation was begun, between France and England, and the p$an of a treaty dige&s;ted; but as Richard did not know the emperor's real &s;entiments, he po&s;tponed the conclu&s;ion of the peace, and, in the mean time, delivered up the prince&s;s Adelais, who was immediately married to the count of Ponthieu. The two kings agreed to a conference, in the neighbour|hood of Verne$il; but Philip, in&s;tead of repairing to the place appointed, &s;ent the archbi&s;hop of Rheims to amu&s;e Richard, while the French troops took this opportunity of his being at a di&s;tance, to ravage part of Normandy, and burn the town of Dieppe, with all the &s;hi$s in the harbour. The war was in&s;tantly renewed. Richard's Brabantins to$k the count of Auvergne, and &s;urpri&s;ed Y&s;&s;odun. Philip marched thither to be&s;iege the place; the king of England ad|vanced to relieve it; and terms of accommodation were again propo&s;ed. By this time the bi&s;hop of Ely had returned from the court of the emperor, whom he found waveri$g and irre&s;olute, though he exhorted Richard to continue the war, and offered to remit &s;eventeen thou&s;and marks of the ran&s;om, that &s;till re|mained unpaid. The king of England cho&s;e to pay the money, rather than act as the in&s;trument of &s;uch a &s;ickle, uncertain ally. Though he had by a &s;adden march hemm$d in Philip &s;o, as that he could not retreat without immi|nent danger, he li&s;tened to the propo&s;als of that monarch, with whom he held a conference between Y&s;&s;odun and Charo&s;t: there the articles of peace were ad|ju&s;ted,

and the treaty afterwards ratified at Louviers, in a numerous a&s;&s;embly, compo&s;ed of the prelates and nobility of both kingdoms.

The limits of France and Normandy were marked by a line drawn from the Eure to the Seine. The king of England relinqui&s;hed his claim to Auvergne; the pri&s;oners on both &s;ides were relea&s;ed; and a penalty of fifteen thou&s;and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer. Hoveden. Gul.

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, the abbot of Caen had found means to per&s;uade the king, that great part of the revenue was embezzled by the officers of the crown: and that it might, by good oeconomy, be doubled without any grievance to the &s;ubject. He was accordingly &s;ent over to England with a commi&s;&s;ion, empowering him to in&s;pect the accounts of all concerned in the revenue; and orders were i&s;&s;ued, for all &s;heriffs and officers to come at an ap|pointed time with their accounts to London: but he died before the day, to the un&s;peakable &s;atisfaction of tho&s;e collectors; nor was his death much lament|ed by Hubert, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who, upon the abbot's arrival, had de&s;ired to re&s;ign his po&s;t, on account of his age and infirmities; and, at the death of that prelate, offered to retain his office of guardian of the realm. In order to efface the impre&s;&s;ions which the abbot's &s;ugge&s;tions had made upon Richard, he gave that prince to under&s;tand, that he had, in the two la&s;t years, remitted to him eleven hundred thou&s;and marks out of England; and the king, &s;truck with the greatne&s;s of the &s;um, was glad to leave the patrimony of the crown to the management of &s;uch a good oeconomi&s;t. Hubert indeed filled all his po&s;ts with dignity and prudence; though he took advantage of Geoffrey's ab&s;ence to exerci&s;e his legatine power in the province of York, which was now deprived of its exemption by pope Cele&s;tine, who was incen&s;ed at Geoffrey for the little regard he expre&s;&s;ed for the &s;ee of Rome.

The populace was headed by a chief, called William Longbeard, who had been bred to the law; but being an idle, profligate vagabond, he renounced his pro|fe&s;&s;ion, accu&s;ed his elder brother of trea&s;on, becau&s;e he refu&s;ed to &s;upply his extravagance; and having wriggled him&s;elf into the magi&s;tracy of London, af|fected

to e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of the poor with uncommon zeal and &s;eeming enthu|&s;ia&s;m. He &s;tiled him&s;elf their &s;aviour; and even went over to Normandy, where he repre&s;ented to the king, that the poorer &s;ort of citizens were oppre&s;&s;ed by an unequal a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment of the taxes, and obtained a mitigation. By the&s;e means he acquired a dangerous degree of popularity, and excited frequent tu|mults again&s;t the wealthy Londoners, who were be&s;ieged in their hou&s;es, and even a&s;&s;aulted in churches. A proclamation was i&s;&s;ued out again&s;t the&s;e di&s;tur|bances; but by this time, above fifty thou&s;and people had engaged in an a&s;&s;o|ciation, to defend and obey William, who murdered his fellow-citizens with|out remor&s;e; and provided a great quantity of iron tools to force open the doors of their warehou&s;es. Hubert, afraid of employing the civil power at once again&s;t &s;$ch a powerful con&s;piracy, convened a common-hall, and in a &s;peech to the citizens, after having complained of the di&s;orders daily committed within their precincts, and repre&s;ented the dangerous con&s;equences of &s;uch licence and irregu$arity, per&s;uaded them to give ho&s;tages, as a proof of their peaceable in|tention, which would convince the king of the fal&s;hood and malice of the re|ports he had heard to their prejudice. He no &s;ooner gained this point, than he &s;ummoned William to appear before the council, and an&s;wer to an accu&s;ation exhibited again&s;t him for murder and &s;edition; but he came with &s;uch a formi|dable train, that the trial was po&s;tponed. Hubert afterwards &s;ent two citizens, with a guard, to apprehend this de&s;perado, who &s;lew one of them, and fought his way with an halbert to the church of St. Mary le Bow, attended by his con|cubine, and &s;ome of his accomplices, who had, by this time, murdered the other citizen. There he was &s;upplied with arms and provi&s;ions, and expected to be joined by the populace; but the&s;e were intimidated on account of the ho&s;|tages they had given, as well as by a numerous body of well armed forces, by which the church was immediately inve&s;ted. William &s;till refu&s;ing to &s;ubmit to a legal trial, Hubert ordered the &s;oldiers to force the body of the church; &s;o that he and his men were obliged to retire into the &s;teeple, from whence he was driven by a &s;moke of wet &s;traw kindled for the purpo&s;e. He was then taken, tried, convicted, and, being drawn at a hor&s;e's tail through the &s;treets of London, was hung in chains, with nine of his accomplices. The lower cla&s;s of people revered him as a martyr, and began to believe reports of his having wrought miracles. The gibbet was &s;tolen as rivalling the cro&s;s in &s;anctity.

<P>Mean while Brittany became a &s;cene of confu&s;ion. Con&s;tance had, after the death of Geoffrey, married Ralf Blundeville, earl of Che&s;ter, who had under the late king admini&s;tered the affairs of that dutchy. He lived at variance with the prince&s;s, and his government was &s;o odious to the Bretons, that they drove him out of the country, and he had retired to his e&s;tate in Normandy. The king, de&s;irous of effecting a reconciliation between him and Con&s;tance, &s;ent for this prince&s;s, who was &s;urpri&s;ed on the road by her hu&s;band, and con|fined in his ca&s;tle of S. James de Bevron. Richard claimed the guardian&s;hip of her &s;on Arthur, now in the ninth year of his age; and certainly had the be&s;t title to that office, both as his uncle, and duke of Normandy, of which the dutchy of Brittany was a fief. But Con&s;tance, de&s;irous of re&s;erving to her&s;elf the charge of his education, recommended him to the protection of &s;ome lords who were in the French intere&s;t, who conveyed the young prince to S. Paul de Leon, in the Lower Brittany, and &s;ollicited Philip's a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Again&s;t tho&s;e noblemen Richard detached Murchadde with his Brabantins, and Stephen de Turnham, at the head of a body of forces rai&s;ed in Poitou, Anjou, and Le|maine, who were wor&s;ted in a battle fought near Carhaes, in the dioce&s;e of Cornouaille. Philip took this opportunity of Richard's being unfurni&s;hed of troops, to renew ho&s;tilities; and as the abbots of St. Denis, Marmoutier, and Cluny, with the prior of La Charit&eacute;, had been his &s;ureties for ob&s;erving the peace, he was no &s;ooner guilty of this infraction, than Richard &s;eized the lands belong|ing to tho&s;e convents in England, until they &s;hould pay the penalty of fifteen<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoveden.</NOTE> thou&s;and marks which they had forfeited. The French king invading Nor|mandy at this juncture, met with very little oppo&s;ition, and took Aumale with &s;everal other places, while Richard was obliged to act on the defen&s;ive, at the head of a &s;mall body, till towards the latter end of the campaign, when his af|fairs a&s;&s;umed a more favourable a&s;pect. The Bretons were fain to &s;ubmit and give ho&s;tages for their fidelity: Con&s;tance, being enlarged, was entru&s;ted with the guardian&s;hip of her &s;on, after &s;he had &s;worn to do nothing without the ad|vice of the king of England; and the long quarrel between Richard and Rai|mund,

<P>The peace of Guienne being thus &s;ecured, the king re&s;olved to &s;trengthen the frontiers of Normandy, and gave orders for erecting a fortre&s;s at Andely, through which the French had always found an ea&s;y entrance in their in|cur&s;ions. The ground belonged to the &s;ee of Rouen, and Richard offered to make rea&s;onable &s;atisfaction to the archbi&s;hop; but that prelate, inflexibly de|voted to the rights of the church, even when they cla&s;hed with the public good, rejected the equivalent, appealed to the pope, and laid all Normandy under an interdict. Richard &s;ent agents to Rome to ju&s;tify his conduct; and the cau&s;e being heard, his holine&s;s decreed that Andely &s;hould be conveyed to the king<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 11$7.</NOTE> for lands of an equal value. In conformity with this deci&s;ion, he granted to the &s;ee of Rouen, three towns and other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, to the amount of five hundred livres a year more than the revenue of Andely, the fortifications of which were completed; and this, together with the famous Chateau Gaillard erected at the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dic$t. Coll.</NOTE> &s;ame time, &s;erved on that &s;ide as the bulwark of Normandy. As a dreadful dearth, and its attendant pe&s;tilence, prevailed over all the we&s;tern parts of Eu|rope, it was impracticable to bring great armies into the field; con&s;equently the war was maintained in &s;light incur&s;ions. Richard, making an irruption into Picardy, took the town of St. Valery on the Somme, de&s;troyed the ca&s;tle, &s;eized all the &s;hips in the harbour, and among the&s;e, finding five corn Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;els, cau&s;ed the ma&s;ters to be hanged as traitors, for &s;upplying the enemy with provi&s;ion. The ca&s;tle of Melly in Beauvoi&s;is, was inve&s;ted by John, count of Mortaign, and Marcaddee, general of the Brabantins; and being taken, was demoli&s;hed. Peter de Dreux, bi&s;hop of Beauvais, and fir&s;t cou&s;in to the French king, advancing with a body of troops to its relief, fell into an ambu&s;h, was routed and taken pri&s;oner. Richard ordered this in&s;olent prelate to be clo&s;ely confined at Rouen, and even fettered him as a mark of di&s;grace: and two of his clergy petitioning that he might be u&s;ed with le&s;s &s;everity, the king told them, that he treated the bi&s;hop in this manner, by way of retaliation for the repeated injuries he had done him in the ea&s;t, and during his captivity; ob&s;erving that, in con&s;equence of Peter's admonitions to the emperor, he him&s;elf had been loaded with as many chains as an hor&s;e could carry. The bi&s;hop &s;ollicited the pope to interceed with Richard in his behalf; but that pontiff de|clined the office, becau&s;e he had been taken in arms like a &s;oldier; and the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hov$d$n.

<P>As Philip had taken all occa&s;ions to retrench the privileges and cru&s;h the exorbitant power of the nobility, a &s;pirit of di&s;content had diffu&s;ed it|&s;elf through &s;ome of the fir&s;t families in France, and Richard did not fail to take the advantage of this di&s;&s;atisfaction. Among the&s;e malecont$nts the mo&s;t powerful was Baldwin, count of Flanders and Hainault, a third part of who&s;e territories had been &s;eized by Philip, at the death of his predece&s;&s;or. With him the king of England engaged in an offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive league again&s;t France, that &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t for ever, and be obligatory on their de&s;cendants. Ri$hard immediately &s;upplied the count w$th a &s;um of money, that enabled him to rai&s;e a &s;trong body of forces, with which he reduced a number of fortre&s;&s;es, and at la&s;t inve&s;ted Arras. Philip advancing to the relief of the place, the count
<PB N="407" REF="4160">
rai&s;ed the &s;iege, and retired before him, until the French king had penetrated a great way into the country, when he found that Baldwin had very artfully &s;ent detachments to break down the bridges, open the &s;luices, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pa&s;&s;es in his rear, &s;o that he could neither be &s;upplied with provi&s;ion, nor retreat without the mo&s;t imminent danger. In this emergency, he propo&s;ed terms of accommodation to the count, reminding him of his duty as a va&s;&s;al of France, recapitulated the loyalty and &s;ervices of his ance&s;tors, and promi&s;ed to re&s;tore all he had taken from Flanders, if he would renounce his alliance with the king of England, the inveterate enemy of the French monarchy. Baldwin, thus cajoled, allowed him to retreat unmole&s;ted; but, being afraid of break|ing with Richard, to whom he had given ho&s;tages for the performance of ar|ticles, he acted the part of mediator, and per&s;uaded the king of England to agree to a conference, at a place between Gaillon and Andely, where, though the two monarchs, mutually exa&s;perated again&s;t each other, would not con&s;ent to a perfect reconciliation, the prelates and nobility, who bore the bur|den of the war, interpo&s;ed their authority &s;o effectually, that a truce for one year was concluded, and the pri&s;oners on both &s;ides were relea&s;ed, for a rea&s;onable<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr.

<P>By this time Richard perceived how little he could depend upon the count of Flanders; and his conduct, on this occa&s;ion, was not &s;o much in|fluenced by Baldwin's per&s;ua&s;ions, as by the remon&s;trances of Hubert, arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury, whom he had &s;ent for to the continent, to con&s;ult about the affairs of England. At that prelate's return, he i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, fix|ing the &s;tandard of the currency; and appointing one &s;et of weights and mea|&s;ures to be u&s;ed all over the kingdom, under &s;evere penalties; at the &s;ame time certain regulations were made for the prevention of frauds in the woollen ma|nufacture. Then he made a progre&s;s to the marches of Wales, changing the governors of the frontier ca&s;tles; thence repairing to Coventry, he turned the &s;ecular canons out of the priory, and re&s;tored the monks, who had been ex|pelled by Hugh Nonant, bi&s;hop of that dioce&s;e. While he thus exerci&s;ed lega|tine power, pop$ Cele&s;tine died, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;or Innocent III. would never renew his commi&s;&s;ion. This pontif was prejudiced again&s;t the archbi&s;hop, by the in&s;inu|ation of the monks of Chri&s;t-church, who &s;u&s;pecting Hubert of a de&s;ign again&s;t them &s;imilar to that of his predece&s;&s;or Baldwin, repre&s;ented him as an enemy to the papal authority. Innocent, alarmed at their &s;ugge&s;tions, ordered them to demoli&s;h a chapel he had fini&s;hed at Lambeth, and re&s;ign the po&s;t of chief ju&s;|ticiary, which by the canons was incompatible with the eccle&s;ia&s;tical character.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoveden.</NOTE> In this office he was &s;ucceeded by Geoffrey Fitz-piers, who had been ju&s;tice of the king's court, and inherited the barony of William de Mandeville, late earl of E&s;&s;ex. Under this new ju&s;ticiary's admini&s;tration, the a&s;&s;ize of the fore&s;t was publi&s;hed, re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the &s;evere penalties of the game-laws enacted by Henry &s;on of the conqueror; and a grievous talliage was exacted from the &s;ub|ject, at the rate of five &s;hillings for every hide or hundred acres of land in the kingdom. This was the &s;evere&s;t tax which had been impo&s;ed &s;ince the reign of William the conqueror; and falling upon the &s;occage tenants and farmers, pro|duced great clamour and di&s;tre&s;s. Then the clergy were &s;ubjected to the im|po&s;ition; though at fir&s;t they refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to the authority of the general

council, but being deprived of the protection of the king's courts, and di&s;abled from recovering debts and forfeitures, they at length con&s;ented to pay their proportion of the talliage. After this unpopular tran&s;action Geoffrey marched into South Wales, to rai&s;e the &s;iege of ca&s;tle Payen, in Radnor&s;hire, in which William de Braou&s;e was inve&s;ted by Gwenwynwyn, lord of Powis, who&s;e kin&s;man Vaughan had been treacherou&s;ly put to death by William's contrivance.

<P>The truce with Philip was no &s;ooner expired than Baldwin, count of Flanders, invaded Artois, and took St. Omer, while the French king ra|vaged the frontiers of Normandy, and ordered all his pri&s;oners to be deprived of their eye-&s;ight; a barbarous practice, which provoked Richard to a re|taliation. The two kings had now taken the field, in&s;pired with per&s;onal animo&s;ity again&s;t each other, and at length they met between Gamages and Vernon. They engaged immediately with great fury on both &s;ides; but vic|tory &s;oon declared for Richard, who routed his adver&s;ary, and pur&s;ued him to the very gates of Vernon, from whence he retired to Mante, in order to re|cruit his forces. The victor improved his advantage by the reduction of &s;eve|ral ca&s;tles, and at length took Courcelles by a&s;&s;ault: but the French king being ignorant of this event, and having by this time rea&s;&s;&s;mbled a numerous army, re&s;olved to attempt the relief of that important fortre&s;s. For this purpo&s;e he began his march from Mante, with four hundred knights, a thou&s;and e&s;quires on hor&s;eback, and a large body of militia; but when he had advanced to the neighbourhood of Courcelles, he was attacked by Richard, and, being again de|feated, fled in great di&s;order to Gi&s;ors.

This accident cutting off the retreat of the French forces, they were almo&s;t all killed or taken; and among the pri&s;oners were Matthew de Montmorency, Alan de Bou&s;&s;y, and Fulk de Gilerval, whom Richard unhor&s;ed and took by his own per&s;onal<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brompton.

<P>In con&s;equence of this victory, Marcaddee, with his Brabantins, made an incur&s;ion into Picardy, as far as Abbe Ville, where he found an im|men&s;e booty, and took a number of merchants, who paid large &s;ums for their ran&s;ome. Richard erected the fortre&s;s of Boutavant in an i&s;land of the Seine, and Philip, rai&s;ing a new army, burned the town of Evreux, and &s;even villages, in the neighbourhood. Tired, however, of an un&s;ucce&s;sful war, he made over|tures of peace, and offered very advantageous terms to Richard, who could expect no advantage from ho&s;tilities; he &s;ollicited the pope's interpo&s;ition to|wards an accommodation between him and the king of England; and Innocent knowing the Chri&s;tians of the Holy Land could not be effectually relieved, while the war between the two crowns continued, readily complied with his re|que&s;t, and &s;ent Peter, cardinal of Capua, as his legate to mediate a reconcilia|tion. Though Richard loudly complained, that the pope had refu&s;ed to excom|municate the king of France for having &s;eized his territories, while he was en|gaged in the cru&s;ade, he was plea&s;ed with an opportunity to oblige that pon|tiff, whom he wanted to engage in the intere&s;t of his nephew Otho, and con|&s;ented to the legate's prepo&s;al of an interview with Philip. They met between Vernon and Andely, Richard appearing in a boat, and the French king &s;itting on hor&s;eback, on the bank of the river. Here they agreed to accept the me|diation of the pope, and fixed the time and place for another conference, in pre&s;ence of the cardinal, prelates, and nobility, of both nations. At this &s;e|cond meeting they concluded a truce for five years, and the troops on both &s;ides were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. Marcaddee, in marching with his Brabantins to his quarters, was attacked by four French noblemen, at the head of a &s;trong body of forces, and &s;everal of his people were &s;lain. Richard, confiding in the truce, had repaired to Guienne, and Philip, taking the advantage of his ab&s;ence, erect|ed<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Richard was not a prince to put up with the&s;e indignities: he returned forthwith to Normandy, and &s;ent his chancellor Eu&s;tace, bi&s;hop of Ely, to demand &s;atisfaction, and declare that he would hold the truce as di&s;&s;olved, unle&s;s Philip would order the new ca&s;tle to be immediately demoli&s;hed. The French king di&s;avowed the injury done to the Brabantins, and promi&s;ed to di&s;mantle the fortre&s;s; but Richard in&s;i&s;ted upon a final di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of all di&s;putes. Several conferences were held, and at la&s;t both parties &s;ignified their approbation of a plan of pacification, propo&s;ing that the king of England &s;hould give his niece Blanche, of Ca&s;tile, in marriage to Philip's elde&s;t &s;on Lewis, together with Gi&s;ors and twenty thou&s;and marks of &s;ilver; that all the other places taken from Richard &s;hould be re|&s;tored; that as an indemnification for Gi&s;ors, Philip &s;hould convey to the king of England, the right of nomination to the archbi&s;hopric of Tours; and that the king of France &s;hould promi&s;e upon oath to a&s;&s;i&s;t Otho with all his power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth.

Upon this occa&s;ion the French king, with a view to &s;ow the &s;eeds of di&s;cord in the royal family of England, gave Richard to under&s;tand, that his brother John $ad courted his protection in private, and devoted him&s;elf en|tirely to the &s;ervice of France: in order to confirm the truth of this allegation, he produced a letter in John's own hand-writing, which in all probability he had received in the cour&s;e of their former corre&s;pondence. Richard, giving way

to the fir&s;t tran&s;port of his pa&s;&s;ion, ordered his brother's lands to be &s;eque&s;tred, without examining into the truth of the accu&s;ation; and John, being informed of the charge, &s;ent two knights to the court of France to defend his innocence, either in court or combat. Philip declined the challenge, and Richard being convinced of John's innocence, re-admitted him farther into his favour than he had ever advanced before; becau&s;e he had hitherto doubted his fidelity, and even &s;ign fi$d that doubt, when he pardoned him at the de&s;ire of his mother.</P>

<P>In the cour&s;e of this year, Richard was involved in a petty quarrel that co&s;t him his life. Aymar, vi&s;count of Limoges, refu&s;ing to deliver a trea&s;ure, found by a pea&s;ant in digging a field, upon its being claimed by the king of England as lord paramount, he a&s;&s;embled a body of troops and inve&s;ted the ca&s;tle of Chal$s, where he under&s;tood this curious trea&s;ure was lodged. On the fourth day of the &s;iege, as he rode about the place with Marcaddee, to ob&s;erve where the a&s;&s;$$lt might be given with the $aire&s;t pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, he was &s;hot in the &s;hou$der with an arrow from a cross-bow; and the un&s;kilful &s;urgeon endeavouring to di&s;engage it from the fle&s;h, mangled the part in &s;uch a manner, that a gangrene en&s;ued. When he sound his end approaching, he made a will, in which he bequeathed the kingdom of England with a$l his other dominions, and three fourths of h$s trea&s;ure, to his brother John; the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoveden. Brempton.</NOTE> other fourth of his trea&s;ure he di&s;tributed among his &s;ervants and the poor, and $is $ewels he left to his $ephew Otho, k$ng o$ Germany. After he had de|&s;paired of his recovery, he was vi&s;ited by the archb$&s;hop of Rouen, who a&s;&s;um|ing the privi$ege of a gho$$$y director, exhorted him to put away his three daughters, namely, price, coveto$&s;ne&s;s, and luxury. Richard replied, with great good humour, that he bequeathed his pride to the Knights Templars; his covetou&s;ne&s;s to the C$$ter$ans; and his luxury to the prelates. The ca&s;tle of Chalus being taken, he ordered Bertram de Gourdon, who had &s;hot the arrow, to be brought into his pre&s;ence, and a&s;ked, what injury he had done him, that he &s;hould take away his life? The other an&s;wered, with great deliberation, that he had, with his own hand, &s;la$n his father and two brothers, and that he &s;hould &s;uffer chearfully all the torments which could be inflicted, &s;ince he had been the in&s;trument of providence that delivered the world of &s;uch a tyrant, who had filled it with blood and carn$ge. Ri$ha$d$ &s;truck with th$s an&s;wer, order|ed the &s;$ldier to be pre&s;ented with one hundred &s;hillings, and &s;et at liberty; but Marcaddee like a true ruffian, command$d him to be flead alive, for having done his duty. The king having &s;ettled the concerns of his &s;oul, and given directions about his funeral, expired on the &s;ixth day of April, in the forty|&s;econd year of his age, and the tenth of his reign, leaving only one natural &s;on, called Philip, to whom he had given the ca&s;tle and honour of Cognac in Guienne; and this &s;on r$venged his father's death by &s;laying the vi&s;count of L$moges. Rich|ard's brain and bowels were, in con&s;equence of his own de&s;ire, interred in the abbey of St. Sau$eur de Charr$ux, in Poitou; his heart, which appeared of a &s;urpriz|ing magnitude, was depo&s;ited in a &s;ilver &s;hrine, in the cathedral of Rouen; and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ho$eden.</NOTE> his body was buried near his father, in the church of Fontevrault.</P>

<P>This renowned prince was tall, &s;trong, &s;traight, and well-proportioned. His arms were remarkably long, his eyes blue and full of vivacity. His hair was of a yellowi&s;h colour, his countenance fair and comely, and his air maje&s;tic. He was endued with a good natural under&s;tanding; his penetration was uncom|mon;
<PB N="411" REF="4200">
he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a fund of manly eloquence; his conver&s;ation was &s;pirited; and he was admired for his talent at repartee. As for his courage and ability in war, both Europe and A&s;ia re&s;ounded with his prai&s;e. The Saracens &s;tilled their children with the terror of his name; and Saladine, who was an accom|pli&s;hed prince, admired his valour to &s;uch a degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m, that immedi|ately after Richard had defeated him on the plains of Joppa, he &s;ent him a couple of fine Arabian hor&s;es in token of his e&s;teem; a polite compliment, which Richard returned with magnificent pre&s;ents. Tho&s;e are the &s;hining parts of his character, which, however, cannot dazzle the judicious ob&s;erver &s;o much, but that he may perceive a number of blemi&s;hes, which no hi&s;torian has been able to efface from the memory of this celebrated monarch. His ingrati|tude and want of filial affection are unpardonable. He was proud, haughty, ambitious, choleric, cruel, vindictive, and debauched. Nothing could equal his rapaciou&s;ne&s;s, but his profu&s;ion; and indeed the one was the effect of the other: he was a tyrant to his wife, as well as to his people, who groaned un|der his taxations to &s;uch a degree, that even the glory of his victories did not exempt him from their execrations: in a word, he has been aptly compared to a lion, a &s;pecies of animals which he re&s;embled, not only in his courage, but likewi&s;e in his ferocity.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; I.</HEAD>
<P>THE will that Richard made in favour of John to the prejudice of the heir of blood, and &s;o contradictory to his declaration and treaty of Me&s;&s;ina, was, in all probability, a &s;acrifice to the &s;ollicitation of his mo|ther Eleanor, who could not bear the thoughts of &s;eeing her influence eclip&s;ed by Con&s;tance of Brittany, which would have been the ca&s;e had Arthur &s;uc|ceeded to his uncle: &s;he had already made her own &s;tipulations with John; and her affections declared for her own &s;on, who had been bred under her eye, rather than in favour of a &s;tranger with who&s;e per&s;on &s;he was hardly acquaint|ed. Arthur was but ju&s;t turned of twe$ve at his uncle's decea&s;e. He lived under the tuition of his mother Con&s;tance, who, being weak, pa&s;&s;ionate, and indi&s;creet, had found it impracticable to form any party in his behalf. Her conduct was &s;o imprudent, that &s;he forfeited the e&s;teem of all tho&s;e who might have befriended her family. She was &s;u&s;pected of an amorous intercour&s;e with John, and her hu&s;band Ralf, earl of Che&s;ter, having obtained a d vorce on<NOTE PLACE="marg">I eland. $oveden.</NOTE> that account, &s;he married Guy, a younger brother of the vi&s;count de Thouars. Hered$tary right had been often &s;et a&s;ide in England both under the Saxon and Norman government; therefore the people could not be greatly &s;hocked at the ex|clu&s;ion of young Arthur, a foreigner, whom they had never &s;een, in favour of prince John, who had been educated among them, and who had already &s;e|cured the greate&s;t men of the kingdom in his intere&s;t.</P>
</DIV4>

<HEAD>&sect; II.</HEAD>
<P>Tho' nobody would e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of Arthur in England, he was not &s;o little regarded in all the other dominions that belonged to Richard. Thomas de Furnes delivered to him the town and ca&s;tle of Angers: All the pre|lates and nobility of Anjou, Touraine and Maine, acknowledged Arthur as their liege lord, and, by an act of their a&s;&s;embly, e&s;tabli&s;hed him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the go|vernment. Con&s;tance thought proper to put him under the protection of Phi|lip, king of France, who garri&s;oned all his towns and ca&s;tles, &s;ent the young prince to be educated with his &s;on Lewis at Paris; and, without any regard to the truce, invaded Normandy, which he wa&s;ted with fire and &s;word. Mean while John,
<PB N="414" REF="4230">
upon his brother's decea&s;e, repaired to Chi$on, where the trea&s;ure was depo&s;ited, and this was immediately delivered by the governor, Robert de Turnham, to|gether with all the fortre&s;&s;es in his cu&s;tody. This important &s;tep being taken, he di&s;patched Hubert, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and William Mare&s;chal to Eng|land, to concert mea&s;ures for &s;ecuring his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in that kingdom, with Geoffre$ Fitzpiers the chief ju&s;ticiary, and the other noblemen who&s;e intere&s;t he<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. Paris. T$$vet.</NOTE> had be&s;poke, while he him&s;elf &s;taid in Normandy to manage the affairs of his foreign dom$nions. The town of Le Mans having recognized the title of Ar|thur, John advanced with his forces again&s;t that city, which, together with the ca&s;tle, he reduced, and r$zed the walls in terrorem; thus impoliticly di&s;mant|ling the be&s;t frontier town in his dominions. After this exploit, he returned to Rouen, where he was inve&s;ted with the &s;word and ducal coronet of Normandy, by the archbi&s;hop of that capital, who admini&s;tred to him the oath u&s;ually taken on &s;uch occa&s;ions.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; III.</HEAD>
<P>While John was thus employed on the continent, his two deputies with Geoffrey Fitzpiers, exerted them&s;elves for his intere&s;t in England, where they exacted the oath of fealty in his behalf from all citizens, burghers, corporations, and military tenants of the crown: but, at the &s;ame time, the prelates and no|blemen ret red to their ca&s;t$es, which they fortified and &s;upplied, as if they had re&s;olved to maintain their own independency, or, at lea&s;t, di&s;own the authority of John Lackland count of Mortain Whether they had already formed the de&s;ign of a&s;certaining their liberty again&s;t the encroachment of the crown's prero|gative, or dreaded the re&s;entment and vindictive di&s;po&s;ition of John, who&s;e trea|&s;onable practices they had formerly oppo&s;ed; certain it is they kept aloof from the ju&s;ticiary and his confederates, and, had Arthur been in the kingdom, would, in all probability, have &s;upported his title. Hubert and his colleagues perceiving the nece&s;&s;ity of removing their doubts and &s;cruples, &s;ummoned them to an a&s;&s;embly at Northampton, where they a&s;&s;ured them of John's favour and pro|tection, and expatiated &s;o eloquently upon his genero&s;ity and munificence, which were proved by the grants of man$rs, ward&s;hips, and beneficial offices, that they were all won over to his intere&s;t, and took the oath of fealty on certain<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trivet.</NOTE> conditions which they &s;tipulated for their own &s;ecurity. At the &s;ame time they prevailed with David, earl of Huntingdon, to go and pacify his brother Wil|liam, king of Scotland, who&s;e envoys they had &s;topped in their way to John with a demand of Cumb$rland and Northumberland. They a&s;&s;ured him that, although they could not allow his deputies to pa&s;s, before he had taken the oath of fealty to the new king, they would u&s;e all their intere&s;t for his &s;atisfaction, if he would wait 'till John's arrival, without rai&s;ing any di&s;turbances in the mean time.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; IV.</HEAD>
<P>He had no opportunity of exerci&s;ing his patience on that &s;ubject; for John, under&s;tanding that the way was paved for his peaceable acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, embarked immediately for England with a &s;trong body of forces, that he might be prepared for all events, and landing at Shoreham, proceeded directly to London. Next day he was crowned at We&s;tmin&s;ter by Hubert, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, in a full a&s;&s;embly of the prelates, earls and barons, and took the accu&s;tomary oath to maintain the peace of the church and the peo|ple; to re&s;train rapine and other iniquities, and to be governed by equity and mercy in all his deci&s;ions. After the ceremony of his coronation, he conferred
<PB N="415" REF="4240">
the po&s;t of chancellor on archbi&s;hop Hubert; William Mare&s;chal and Geoffrey Fitz-piers were inve&s;ted with the &s;word, as earls of Pembroke and E&s;&s;ex: in a few days, William de Ferrers was created earl of Derby; Roger de Lacy re|ceived the ca&s;tle and honour of Pontefract; and other barons were favoured with di&s;tinctions of honour and advantage. The envoys of William king of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cart. Antiq.</NOTE> Scotland were amu&s;ed with general promi&s;es of doing ju&s;tice to their ma&s;ter, whom he invited to his court; and, in hope of an interview with that prince, he repaired to Nottingham. From thence he &s;ent the bi&s;hop of Durham to Ber|wick with his compliments of invitation to William, who, in&s;tead of accompa|nying the prelate to the place of John's re&s;idence, gave him to under&s;tand, that he expected a compliance with his demand in forty days; otherwi&s;e he would do him&s;elf ju&s;tice. In con&s;$quence of this declaration the counties of Northum|berland and Cumberland, with all the ca&s;tles, were committed to the charge of William d'E&s;touteville, a great baron of the north, &s;uppo&s;ed very capable of defending them from inva&s;ion. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoveden.</NOTE></P>

<P>This precaution being taken for the maintenance of the public peace, John returned to Normandy and a&s;&s;embled an army at Rouen to defend his domi|nions again&s;t the attempts of Philip, who propo&s;ed a truce, and both parties agreed to hold a conference during this interval for the determination of all their differences. In the mean time Baldwin, count of Flanders, repaired to Rouen, where he renewed the alliance he had made with Richard, and did homage for the continuance of his pen&s;ion. He was followed by the other French allies whom the late king had engaged in his intere&s;t, to the number of fifteen counts or noblemen, who now vi&s;ited king John, and their &s;ub&s;idies being paid, &s;wore they would never hearken to an accommodation without his con&s;ent; while he, on the other hand, promi&s;ed upon oath, that he would never conclude a treaty with France in which they &s;hould not be included. At the &s;ame time he received letters from Otho, de&s;i$ing he would not make a precipitate peace with Philip, as his affairs began to take a more favourable turn, and he &s;hould in a little time be able to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with the whole force of the empire. Queen Eleanor, after Richard's death, had done homage to the king of France at Tours for the dutchy of Gui|enne, of which &s;he then took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by a previous agreement with her &s;urviving &s;on; but John had never performed the duty of a va&s;&s;al for Nor|mandy, nor hinted the lea&s;t intention of acknowledging the &s;uperiority of the French king; an omi&s;&s;ion which Philip re&s;ented &s;o highly, that when the two<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rob. de Monte. Rigord. de Philip. Ge&s;t.</NOTE> kings met near Gaillon at the conference, he did not behave to the king of England with his u&s;ual politene&s;s$ and was moreover very unrea&s;onable in his demands. For he in&s;i&s;ted upon John's ceding all the Vexin Normand to him|&s;elf, and all Guienne, Anjou, Touraine and Maine, to prince Arthur; conditions which were rejected with di&s;dain. Had John po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his brother's talents for war, he could not have found a more favourable juncture for di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Philip, who was at this time greatly perplexed in con&s;equence of a quarrel with pope Innocent. The French king had, in a &s;kirmi&s;h near Lens, taken Philip count of Namur, and Peter de Corbeil, bi&s;hop elect of Cambray. This la&s;t having been preceptor to Innocent, that pontiff &s;ollicited his relea&s;e, which, however, the king of France refu&s;ed, on pretence that the pope had not interpo&s;ed in be|half of the bi&s;hop of Beauvais, who &s;till remained a pri&s;oner in Normandy. The pope's legate laid France and that dutchy under an interdict until both
<PB N="416" REF="4250">
prelates &s;hould be &s;et at liberty; and when they were exchanged for one ano|ther, this &s;entence was removed. But Philip ran the ri&s;k of another &s;entence of this kind, and even of excommunication, in con&s;equence of his divorce from the Dani&s;h prince&s;s, and his &s;ub&s;equent marriage with Mary, daughter of Ber|thold duke of Meranie, which were both declared null, tho' Mary had born a daughter, and was now pregnant with a &s;on, whom the father alterwards legi|timated. Innocent ordered him to put away this prince&s;s, and take back Ingel|burga, on pain of being excommunicated and &s;eeing his kingdom laid under an interdict; and this la&s;t &s;entence was actually pronounced by a council a&s;|&s;embled at Vienne in Dauphine. Philip was extremely chagrined at this cen|&s;ure; and tho&s;e who obeyed it, whether eccle&s;ia&s;tics or la$ty, were treated with great &s;everity: but, in &s;pite of all his endeavours, it had &s;uch an effect upon his &s;ubjects, and he was &s;o apprehen&s;ive of an excommunication, that he &s;ubmit|ted to the pope's order, renounced his latter marriage, and took Ingelburga again to wife, in a public council held at Ne&s;le by two cardinals delegated for<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rigord.</NOTE> determining this affair.</P>

<P>The conference between the kings of France and England having proved ineffectual, Philip invaded Normandy, reduced Conches, and then marching into Le Maine di&s;mantled Ballon, one of the &s;tronge&s;t fortre&s;&s;es of that country. William de Roches, hereditary &s;ene&s;chal of the dutchy, and general of Arthur's forces, complained of this demolition as an injury to the young prince, and was an&s;wered in a haughty manner by Philip, who advanced immediately to the &s;iege of Lavardin. The &s;ene&s;chal, apprehen&s;ive of this fort's being treated in the &s;ame manner, and plainly perceiving that the French king acted only for his own intere&s;t, re&s;olved to effect an accommodation be|tween Arthur and his uncle, to whom he made very acceptable overtures. John immediately marched to the relief of Lavardin with &s;uch an army, that Philip thought proper to raise the &s;iege and retire with precipitation. William had found means to conduct Arthur privately from Paris to Le Mans, which he now delivered up to the king of England; and John, having this capital, together with his nephew and Con&s;tance, in his power, &s;ent for Aimery, vi&s;|count of Thouars, whom he compelled to give up Chinon, of which he was go|vernor, and re&s;ign the po&s;t of &s;ene&s;chal of Anjou. Such infractions of the treaty ju&s;t concluded, could not fail to alarm Con&s;tance, who, receiving private inti|mation that John intended to &s;eize the per&s;on of Arthur, retired in the night to Angers with that young prince, the vi&s;count de Thouars, and a great num|ber<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoveden.</NOTE> of adherents.</P>

<P>Mean while Peter of Capua, the pope's legate, prevailed upon the kings of France and England to conclude a truce, in hope of adju&s;ting the ar|ticles of a treaty before it &s;hould expire. During this ce&s;&s;ation, Philip de|tached Baldwin, count of Flanders, from the intere&s;t of John; and the French nobility who were pen&s;ioners to the Engli&s;h monarch, de&s;pairing of &s;ucce&s;s, made their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Philip. This defection, added to the dread of Arthur and the advice of Eleanor, di&s;po&s;ed the king of England to a pacification, and Philip, un$er the terror of the interdict, was in all re&s;pects as peaceably in|clined. With the&s;e favourable di&s;po&s;itions, they met between Gaillon and An|dely, where the conferences were opened, and they &s;oon agreed to a peace on the following conditions: That Evreux &s;hould be ceded to France, and the boun|daries

be fixed between that city and Neubourg; that the fortifications of Portes and Landes &s;hould be demoli&s;hed; &s;o that there &s;hould be no ca&s;tles left be|tween Andely and Gamaches: that John &s;hould be&s;tow his $iece Blanche, daughter of Alfon&s;o king of Ca&s;tile, in marriage upon Lewis prince of France, together with Y&s;&s;oudun, Gra&s;&s;ay, Chateauroux; all the fiefs he claimed in Berry, to be put into his hands immediately and enjoyed during life, whether the marriage &s;hould or &s;hould not be con&s;ummated: but, failing i&s;&s;ue by Blanche, they &s;hould revert to John or his heirs at the death of Lewis; that if John &s;hould die without children, the fiefs of Hugh de Gournay, the counts of Aumale and Perche &s;hould devolve to Lewis; the king of England &s;hould hold of the crown of France, all the dominions on the continent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by his predece&s;&s;ors, except the Vexin Normand and the above-mentioned alie|nations; that he &s;hould pay to Philip, the &s;um of twenty thou&s;and marks for his relief, and the fiefs of Brittany; that Arthur &s;hould do homage for this dutchy to John; and that the king of England &s;hould grant no aid or a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance in money or troops, to his nephew Otho, without the con&s;ent of Philip. The counts of Flanders, Boulogne, and Engoule&s;me, wfith the vi&s;count of Li|moges, were included in this treaty, which was guaranteed by the nobility of France, England, and Normandy, who &s;wore to take arms again&s;t the vio|lator of the&s;e articles. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

<P>In the interval between the agreement and ratification of the treaty, John had come over to England, where, by his own authority, he laid a tax of three &s;hillings a hyde for rai&s;ing the money he had promi&s;ed to pay to Philip; and, after having taken this arbitrary mea&s;ure, he returned to Normandy, from whence, after the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the peace, he marched into Guienne, where he received the homage of Aimery de Thouars, whom Eleanor had gained over to his intere&s;t; and the oath of fealty from the counts of Tholou&s;e, Engoule&s;me, La Marche, Limoges, and all the barons of the country. But his right to this<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> dutchy was conte&s;ted by Otho, who had claimed Guienne and the earldom of York, by virtue of a grant from the late king, and being provoked at the peace with France, &s;ent his brother Henry, duke of Saxony, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e fiefs, and demand the legacy bequeathed to him by Richard. John rejected both his demands, and pleaded con&s;cience in defence of inju&s;tice, by &s;aying that he had re&s;tricted him&s;elf by oath from a&s;&s;i&s;ting Otho, either with money, jewels, lands, or men; a &s;ubterfuge, in all probability, &s;ugge&s;ted by Philip, whom he now con&s;ulted on all occa&s;ions.</P>

<P>Not but that he &s;ometimes acted from the &s;udden impul&s;e of his own un|ruly pa&s;&s;ions, which, at this period, hurried him into an act of inju&s;tice and in|di&s;cretion, that was attended with very trouble&s;ome con&s;equences. I&s;abel, daugh|ter of Aymar Taillefer, count of Angoule&s;me, was affianced to Hugh le Brun, count of La Marche; and John, chancing to &s;ee the young lady in this expedi|tion, was &s;o captivated with her beauty, that he demanded her in marriage of her father, who yielding his con&s;ent to &s;uch an advantageous match, renounced his treaty with the count of La Marche, from who&s;e cu&s;tody he conveyed his daughter to Engoule&s;me. John had been long tired of his own wife, and re|&s;olved to procure a divorce from her, on account of her barrenne&s;s; in pur&s;u|ance of this re&s;olution, he had &s;ent the bi&s;hop of Li&s;ieux, and three Engli&s;h noblemen, as amba&s;&s;adors, to demand the daughter of the king of Portugal in marriage: but now, without paying the lea&s;t regard to his honour or his in|tere&s;t, he obtained the &s;entence of divorce from the archbi&s;hop of Bourdeaux, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the bi&s;hops of Poitiers and Saintes, and was, by the fir&s;t of the&s;e pre|lates, married to I&s;abel of Engoule&s;me. This precipitate marriage incen&s;ed the king of Portugal to &s;uch a degree, that the &s;afety of the amba&s;&s;adors was endangered: the pope took umbrage at a match founded upon a divorce which he had not been &s;ollicited to confirm; and the count of La Marche, being rob|bed of a prince&s;s who had captivated his affection, was &s;o enraged at the injury and di&s;appointment, that he devoted his whole attention to revenge, and had<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoveden.

<P>The king of England, in his return from this expedition, vi&s;ited An|gers, where he exacted one hundred and fifty ho&s;tages from the citizens; and then repaired to England with his fair bride, who was crowned at We&s;tmin&s;ter, by Hubert, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who had lately held a &s;ynod in that place contrary to the orders of the ju&s;ticiary, and enacted &s;everal canons for the refor|mation of abu&s;es, which had crept into the admini&s;tration of eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs. Each of tho&s;e new regulations concluded with a &s;alvo of the honour and privi|leges of the church of Rome; a form that Hubert &s;eems to have adopted to ingratiate him&s;elf with pope Innocent, who was a pontiff of great re&s;olution and abilities, calculated for extending the papal authority. After having kindled the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the people by the &s;ermons of his emi&s;&s;aries, he, on pretence of re|lieving the chri&s;tians of the Holy Land, laid a tax of the fortieth part of all ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical revenues in Italy, Sclavonia, Germany, France, and the Briti&s;h i&s;les, for the maintenance of a new cru&s;ade to be undertaken again&s;t the Saracens; and &s;ent Philip, a Roman notary, to collect this impo&s;ition in England. While the pope thus exerci&s;ed his power over the clergy, he did not fail to exhort the laity to make a voluntary contribution for the &s;ame laudable purpo&s;e. The king of France rai&s;ed the &s;ame proportion in his territories; and John not only granted the fortieth part of his revenue for one year, but al&s;o authori&s;ed the &s;ame col|lection<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bar$r.

<P>Immediately after the new queen's coronation, John, who was ex|tremely de&s;irous of accommodating matters with William, king of Scotland, that, in&s;tead of a dangerous enemy, he might become a u&s;eful ally, &s;ent a &s;plen|did deputation of noblemen, to invite that prince to his court at Lincoln, where he propo&s;ed to receive his homage. The Scot obeyed the &s;ummons, and

arriving with Roland, lord of Galloway, did homage to John in public upon Bre|hill, &s;wearing on the cro&s;s of archbi&s;hop Hubert, that he would be his liegeman, and bear faith to him, of life, limb, and terrene honour again&s;t all men, &s;aving the rights of his own crown. This ceremony of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion was, in all probabi|lity, performed for the counties of Lothian and Galloway, which had formerly belonged to the Cumbrian kingdom, as William, at this time, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no fiefs in England; for his claim to the northern counties was not yet admitted, but the examination of that affair po&s;tponed to another opportunity, &s;o that the Scotti&s;h king retired, not a little di&s;&s;atisfied, to his own dominions. John had the le&s;s to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr. Heniers. Hoveden. Rad. Niger.

Having made a progre&s;s through the northern counties, he kept his Chri&s;tmas with great fe&s;tivity at Guilford, and repaired at Ea&s;ter to Canterbury, where, in imitation of the ancient kings, he and his queen were crowned at that fe&s;tival in the cathedral by Hubert, a&s;&s;i&s;ted with the bi&s;hops of Dublin, London, Roche&s;ter, Ely and Norwich. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Diceto.

<P>While John thus revelled in fea&s;ting, and the delights of his new marriage, the bad effects of that alliance began to appear in Guienne, where a commotion was rai&s;ed by the count of La Marche, and his brother Ralf de Y&s;&s;ou|dun, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the county of Eu in Normandy. John, appri&s;ed of the&s;e di&s;tur|bances, di&s;patched orders to Guerin de Glapion, &s;ene&s;chal of Normandy, to ra|vage Ralf's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and be&s;iege the ca&s;tle of Dreincourt, which was accord|ingly inve&s;ted; but the &s;iege was rai&s;ed by the king of France, who marched with an army to its relief. The king of England, alarmed at the interpo&s;ition of Philip, &s;ummoned the earls and barons of England to meet him at Port&s;mouth, well provided with arms and hor&s;es, to &s;erve him on the continent: but the no|bility, &s;ick of tho&s;e expeditions, in which neither the honour nor intere&s;t of their country was concerned, and under&s;tanding moreover that the pre&s;ent di&s;turbance was the effect of John's tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion, they a&s;&s;embled at Leice&s;ter, in order to deliberate upon the king's command, and con&s;idering the pre&s;ent &s;ervice as a grievance and inva&s;ion of their privileges, unanimou&s;ly agreed to refu&s;e attending him, unle&s;s he would re&s;tore their antient rights. Neverthe|le&s;s, as they had projected no plan of conduct, and cho&s;e no chief to command and direct their confederacy, this re&s;olution produced very little effect. John, being informed of their purpo&s;e, ordered them to deliver up their fortre&s;&s;es. William de Albiny, the fir&s;t nobleman to whom he intimated this demand, compounded for his ca&s;tle of Belvoir, by giving up his &s;on as an ho&s;tage; and the re&s;t were excu&s;ed from this expedition upon paying a certain &s;cutage for every knight's fee, and promi&s;ing to keep the peace of the kingdom. The earl of Pembroke and the con&s;table of Che&s;ter, were &s;ent over to the continent in the mean time, with two hundred men at arms, to repre&s;s the revolters: Hubert de Burgh, the king's chamberlain, was left to guard the marches of Wales with a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoveden.

<P>The fir&s;t &s;tep he took upon his landing, was to appoint a conference with Philip near Andely, where that monarch entered into a friendly expo&s;tula|tion with him, upon the grievances of the barons in Guienne, who had been

oppre&s;&s;ed by John's officers; and &s;ome of them, having lo&s;t their ca&s;tles and ap|plied in vain for redre&s;s, appealed to Philip as lord paramount of their fiefs, and received his protection. His remon&s;trance &s;eemed to make an impre&s;&s;ion upon John, who promi&s;ed to do them ju&s;tice; and he accompanied Philip to Paris, where he was magnificently entertained: from thence he repaired to Chinon, where he was vi&s;ited by the queen dowager Berengaria, to whom he a&s;&s;igned, in lieu of dower, the city of Bayeux, two ca&s;tles in Anjou, and an annuity of a thou&s;and marks. He was now at the head of a &s;ufficient force to &s;uppre&s;s the in&s;urrection in Guienne, and appea&s;e the troubles of that country; but, in&s;tead of going thither, he returned to Normandy, and left Robert de Turnham, to re|duce the revolters. As he di&s;covered no inclination to &s;atisfy the barons, they again complained to the king of France, who reminded him of his promi&s;e, and in&s;i&s;ted upon doing ju&s;tice to his va&s;&s;als, otherwi&s;e he &s;hould be obliged to e&s;|pou&s;e their quarrel in a more effectual manner. John renewed his promi&s;es, but, in&s;tead of indulging the barons with a fair hearing, he &s;ent among them a num|ber of profligate mi&s;creants, noted for &s;trength and agility, who profe&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves his champions, and offered to decide the di&s;pute by duel, according to the practice of the times. The count of La Marche and his brother rejected the challenge, becau&s;e tho&s;e champions were not their peers, and appealed from &s;uch determination once more to Philip, who &s;ent a very &s;evere reproof, mixed with menaces, to the king of England, reproaching him with perfidy and inju&s;tice.

He like|wi&s;e &s;upported the complaints of the barons of Guienne, and demanded ju&s;tice of Philip, with regard to his own pretentions touching that fief, as well as Nor|mandy and Anjou. The king of France, incen&s;ed at the little regard which had been paid to his remon&s;trances, actually prepared to &s;upport the complainants with force of arms; and John, alarmed at his de&s;ign, not only repeated his a&s;&s;u|rances of immediate redre&s;s, but agreed to &s;urrender the ca&s;tles of Tillieres and Boutavant, as pledges of his &s;incerity.

<P>The king of France immediately inve&s;ted Tillieres and Boutavant, which he reduced, with divers other ca&s;tles, and then &s;at down before Gournay, &s;ituated on the river Epte, and counted one of the &s;tronge&s;t places on the fron|tiers of Normandy. Philip, having little hope of reducing it in the u&s;ual way of
<PB N="421" REF="4300">
carrying on approaches, contrived an expedient which &s;ucceeded to his wi&s;h. He broke down the banks of a large pool in the higher ground, and the water ru&s;hed down upon the ca&s;tle with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that the garri&s;on and inhabi|tants were fain to &s;ave their lives by a precipitate flight; &s;o that when the tor|rent &s;ub&s;ided, Philip took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town, where he knighted Arthur, now in the &s;ixteenth year of his age, conferred upon him the inve&s;titure of Brittany, Guienne, and Anjou, and gave him his daughter Mary, yet an infant, in mar|riage. The young prince, ambitious of approving him&s;elf worthy of the&s;e marks of di&s;tinction, was furni&s;hed with a &s;um of money and two hundred knights, to attack Guienne; and hearing, as he pa&s;&s;ed through Poitou, that queen Eleanor was in the ca&s;tle of Mireleau, he marched thither and took it by a&s;&s;ault, his grandmother retiring into a tower, from whence &s;he found means to make John acquainted with her di&s;tre&s;s. Rou&s;ed from his &s;loth at this intelli|gence, he flew to her relief at the head of his Brabantins, and &s;urrounded Ar|thur's &s;mall body, before they had the lea&s;t intimation of his approach: they had been reinforced by a &s;mall party of Poitevin barons, and too confident of their own bravery, re&s;olved to engage the Brabantins in the open plain. For this purpo&s;e, they came forth and attacked John's forces with the utmo&s;t intrepidity; but, after a very ob&s;tinate and bloody action, they were obliged to yield to the numbers of the enemy, who not only repul&s;ed them to the ca&s;tle, but entered with the fugitives; and there the battle was renewed with great fury, till at length prince Arthur was totally defeated and taken pri&s;oner, with Hugh count of La Marche, Geoffrey de Lu&s;ignan, Andrew de Chavigny, the vi&s;count de Chatillerault, Savary de Maubon, and &s;everal other barons, and above two hundred knights. Philip, informed of this di&s;a&s;ter, abandoned the &s;iege of Arques, and marched directly to the Loire, in order to &s;upport the weakened party of Arthur; there having reduced the city of Tours, he &s;et the hou&s;es on fire, levelled the walls, and di&s;mantled the ca&s;tle, while John, contenting him|&s;elf with his victory, returned to Rouen, and relap&s;ed into his former indolence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann. Marga. M. Paris. Rob. de Monte.</NOTE> which, that he might be able to indulge, he, in a little time, executed a &s;cheme of barbarity, which no per&s;on, endued with humanity, can hear related without horror. In&s;tead of improving his victory in the field by activity and addre&s;s, he &s;et at liberty the count of La Marche, and Geoffrey de Lu&s;ignan, the two per|&s;ons from who&s;e activity and re&s;entment he had every thing to fear, even though they delivered their ca&s;tles into his hands; the re&s;t of his pri&s;oners he &s;ent to England, where they were clo&s;e confined in different ca&s;tles, and many of the brave&s;t among them fami&s;hed to death: as for Arthur, he was conveyed to the ca&s;tle of Falai&s;e, where John is &s;aid to have vi&s;ited him in per&s;on, and endea|voured to detach him from the king of France; in&s;tead of gaining his point, he was treated by the young prince with ineffable di&s;dain, upbraided as a tyrant and u&s;urper, and menaced with the vengeance of Philip and his allies. This beha|viour could not be well brooked by a prince of John's di&s;po&s;ition; and, in all probability, extingui&s;hed any &s;entiments of re&s;pect which he might have enter|tained for the per&s;on of Arthur. He was importuned by the king of France and the nobles of Brittany, to relea&s;e this pri&s;oner: he dreaded his talents, his title, and his revenge; and thus actuated, re&s;olved to deprive him of his life. He is &s;aid to have &s;ent an order for putting out the eyes of this unhappy prince, and rendering him incapable of propagation; but Hubert de Burgh, con&s;table of

the ca&s;tle, in&s;tead of obeying &s;uch a cruel command, gave out that he was dead, and the bells tolled for his &s;uppo&s;ed death all over Normandy. The Bre|tons, taking for granted that he was murdered, vowed revenge and eternal en|mity again&s;t John; and &s;uch a clamour was rai&s;ed through all his dominions on the continent, that Hubert, in order to prevent mi&s;chief, di&s;covered that he was<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rad.

A prince endowed with common policy, would have learned from this &s;pecimen of the people's &s;entiments, how dangerous it would be to make any attempt upon the life of Arthur; but John, in&s;tead of being cautioned by this experiment, ordered him to be removed from Falai&s;e to the ca&s;tle of Rouen, where he was inhumanly put to death; though the circum&s;tances of this cruel<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$$ Ch. 1$$3.</NOTE> tragedy, are not certainly known. John is &s;aid to have pre&s;&s;ed William de Bray, to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the young prince; and that officer an&s;wering, he was a gen|tleman and not an executioner, he tampered with others, who rejected the office in the &s;ame manner, and at la&s;t re&s;olved to &s;acrifice the victim with his own hands. He accordingly went in the night by water, to the tower of Rouen, ordered Arthur to be brought into the boat, thru&s;t his &s;word &s;everal times through his body, which was &s;unk, with an heavy &s;tone, in the river; from which it was afterwards dragged a&s;hore in the net of a fi&s;herman, and interred in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann Marga. Gul. Br$t$.</NOTE> the priory of Notre Dame du Pr&eacute;, without the knowledge of the tyrant. Be this as it may, the youth all at once di&s;appeared; and his uncle indu&s;triou&s;ly cir|culated a report of his having peri&s;hed in the river, in attempting to make his e&s;cape. All the world believed that the young prince was murdered by his con|trivance; and what &s;eemed to ju&s;tify that &s;uppo&s;ition, was its being committed two or three days after the death of his mother Eleanor, during who&s;e life he dur&s;t not have executed &s;uch a barbarous de&s;ign; be&s;ides, he, at this period, made an ha&s;ty voyage to England, and was crowned at Canterbury, as if, con|&s;cious of the murder, he thought that ceremony would con&s;ecrate him anew, and purify him from the guilt. On this occa&s;ion, he carried along with him Arthur's &s;i&s;ter Eleanor, now heire&s;s of Brittany, therefore &s;urnamed La Brette, who inheriting her brother's title to the crown, was now become the object of John's jealou&s;y, and clo&s;e confined at Bri&s;tol, under the guard of four knights,<NOTE PLACE="marg">D$gdale.</NOTE> that &s;he might have no opportunity of engaging in a clande&s;tine marriage.</P>

John, in con&s;e|quence of his nephew's death, demanded the admini&s;tration of that dutchy, as guardian of Eleanor, who was then in his power: but the &s;tates of the province received his propo&s;al with horror; and, far from complying with his demand$ they appointed Guy de Thouars, the la&s;t hu&s;band of Con&s;tance, the chief of their council of government, and guardian to his infant daughter Alice, whom they propo&s;ed to acknowledge as their dutche&s;s, provided her elder &s;i&s;ter Eleanor could not be delivered from captivity. They &s;trongly &s;ollicited the relea&s;e of this prince&s;s; and finding their remon&s;trances di&s;regarded, in an a&s;&s;embly at Vannes, drew up articles of impeachment again&s;t John, whom they accu&s;ed of murder and parricide, lodging their accu&s;ation in the court of peers of France, and deputing the bi&s;hop of Rennes, and Richard de Mare&s;chal, to carry on the proce&s;s. John was accordingly &s;ummoned to vindicate him&s;elf from the charge, and failing to appear, condemned by the unanimous &s;entence of the peers,

<P>Philip was extremely incen&s;ed again&s;t the author of &s;uch a cruel tragedy, which he determined in earne&s;t to revenge. He a&s;&s;embled a body of troops, and marching towards Anjou, almo&s;t all the barons of that province and Poitou, revolting from John, put them&s;elves under his protection: the tyrant had already been abandoned by &s;everal noblemen of approved fidelity, who would no longer &s;erve &s;uch an infamous ma&s;ter. Juhael de Mayenne, a power|ful lord in Bretagne, left him immediately after the murder, and joined his coun|trymen in the pro&s;ecution; and William de Roches, &s;ene&s;chal of Maine and Anjou, de&s;erted him on the &s;ame occa&s;ion, and took Angers by &s;urpri&s;e: in a word, the defection became general, and John, giving way once more to his brutal di&s;po&s;ition, ordered all their ho&s;tages to be put to death in the fury of revenge. Philip having, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Bretons and Poitevins, redu|ced<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trivet.</NOTE> a number of fortre&s;&s;es beyond the Loire, and on the borders of Normandy, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his forces; and John &s;eized this opportunity to inve&s;t Alen&ccedil;on, which the count had put into the hands of the French king. When he had made &s;ome progre&s;s in the &s;iege, Philip, under&s;tanding there was a va&s;t concour&s;e of knights at a tournament in the neighbourhood of Moret, went thither, and per&s;uaded them to march to the relief of Alen&ccedil;on; they were glad of &s;uch an opportunity to &s;ignalize their courage, and advanced with &s;uch expedition, that John rai&s;ed the &s;iege and retired with great precipitation, leaving his machines, tents, and baggage to the enemy.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XIX.</HEAD>
<P>The victor then turned his arms again&s;t Normandy, in which he took &s;everal fortre&s;&s;es, and was admitted into others; and about the middle of Augu&s;t, he undertook the &s;iege of Chateau Gaillard, on the banks of the Seine, built by Richard, and &s;uppo&s;ed impregnable. John, though at the head of an army equal in number to the French, was afraid of hazarding a battle, partly from cowardice, the con&s;equence of his guilt, and partly from a &s;u&s;picion of his &s;oldiers. He had &s;olicited the pope's mediation, and his holine&s;s &s;ent two abbots to negociate a peace. The&s;e deputies, by virtue of the papal authority and injunctions, commanded both princes to a&s;&s;emble their prelates and nobility, in order to adju&s;t the articles of a pacification, and to repair the churches and mona&s;teries, which had been demoli&s;hed in the cour&s;e of the war between the two kingdoms. Philip di&s;patched &s;ome of his prelates to Rome, where they repre&s;ented John in &s;uch colours, that Innocent was prevailed upon to &s;u&s;pend his interpo&s;ition in the quarrel; and the king of England, having nothing far|ther to expect from his holine&s;s, re&s;olved at length to make an effort to throw &s;upplies into the ca&s;tle of Gaillard. For this purpo&s;e, he detached the earl of Pembroke, with a &s;trong body of hor&s;e and foot, to attack and amu&s;e the be|&s;iegers, while a fleet of &s;eventy flat-bottomed ve&s;&s;els, loaded with provi&s;ion and ammunition, and manned with three thou&s;and Flemings, was rowed up the river, to de&s;troy a bridge of boats formed by the French, and &s;uccour the be|&s;ieged. The &s;cheme was well laid; but, this armament moving &s;lowly again&s;t wind and tide, the earl of Pembroke arrived at the &s;cene of action, long before
<PB N="424" REF="4330">
it reached the bridge; and attacking the enemy's camp in the night, filled it with di&s;order and con&s;ternation. His Brabantins, however, were more intent upon plunder, than de&s;irous of improving the advantage they had gained, and the French perceiving them di&s;per&s;ed and bu&s;y in pillaging the camp, rallied and charged them with &s;uch vigour, that they were immediately routed, and fled in great confu&s;ion. The fleet did not appear till day light, when the whole force of the French, being united again&s;t its efforts, the commander found it im|practicable, either to demoli&s;h the bridge, or throw &s;upplies into the place, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">G$l.

<HEAD>&sect; XX.</HEAD>
<P>This was the la&s;t attempt that John made for the defence of his fo|reign dominions: while Philip blocked up the ca&s;tle of Gaillard, took Andely, and even reduced Radepont, an important place in the neighbourhood of Rouen, the king of England indulged him&s;elf in riot and &s;loth, &s;aying, when re|minded of Philip's progre&s;s, "Let him proceed; I &s;hall recover more in one "day, than he can conquer in a whole twelvemonth." Such was his indo|lence and &s;eeming tranquillity, in this alarming &s;ituation, that people could not help believing he was bewitched: and the Engli&s;h nobility at his court, fore|&s;eeing nothing but di&s;grace and danger, as the re&s;ult of this infatuated beha|viour, de&s;ired leave to vi&s;it England, from whence they promi&s;ed, in a little time, to return. He would not, however, put them to that unnece&s;&s;ary trouble; for, after having di&s;mantled &s;everal &s;trong towns, &s;o as to lay the country open<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. Paris. Ann. Wav$r.</NOTE> to the incur&s;ions of the enemy, he ordered four &s;hips to be privately prepared for his pa&s;&s;age, and quitting Normandy, &s;et &s;ail for England. Philip did not fail to improve his opportunity; he now extended his conque&s;ts without oppo&s;ition; for the Normans con&s;idered John's departure as a renunciation of the dutchy to the lord paramount: be&s;ides, they were incen&s;ed at his leaving the command to Arches Martin, and Lupecaire, two of his Brabantin chiefs, under whom the Norman nobility di&s;dained to &s;erve upon any principle. Though all the Vexin frontier, and a great number of places were reduced by the French king, Cha|teau-Gaillard &s;till held out, through the courage and conduct of Roger de Lacy, con&s;table of Che&s;ter, who commanded the garri&s;on. At length Philip, with $n|credible labour, filled up a hollow way between this ca&s;tle and an oppo&s;ite rock, &s;o that he could bring his machines to act again&s;t the walls; and, at the &s;ame time, he employed a great number of miners to &s;ap the foundation. The&s;e en|deavours &s;ucceeded; the fort was taken after a &s;iege of &s;ix months, and the governor made pri&s;oner, with the remains of his garri&s;on, by this time reduced below two hundred fighting men. Philip treated him with great re&s;pect, for the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1204.</NOTE> gallant defence he had made, and even allowed him to live at liberty in Paris upon his parole; but he would not relea&s;e him entirely, until he had paid &s;ix thou&s;and marks for his ran&s;om.</P>

<P>The French king having reduced this important fortre&s;s, re&s;olved to be|&s;iege Falai&s;e, the bulwark of lower Normandy; but, before he had begun to open his batteries, Lupecaire the governor &s;urrendered the town and ca&s;tle, and, with his Brabantins, entered into the &s;ervice of France. All the other places in that part of the country &s;ubmitted without oppo&s;ition; while Guy de Thouars, with a numerous army of Bretons, invaded Normandy on the other &s;ide, reduced ca&s;tles and com|mitted terrible ravages. John, though he had not &s;pirit enough to oppo&s;e the French king in his conque&s;ts, was &s;o nettled at this incur&s;ion, that he equipped an ar|mament
<PB N="425" REF="4340">
of Engli&s;h, who made a de&s;cent upon Brittany in Guy's ab&s;ence, took &s;everal towns, pillaged the country, and, at the approach of Thouars, with a rein|forcement of French troops, re-embarked at Cancale with a con&s;iderable booty.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rad. Niger.</NOTE> The whole dutchy of Normandy was now &s;ubdued, except Vernueil, Arques, and Rouen, which engaged in a league for their mutual defence. Rouen, the capital, was the fir&s;t of the three which Philip inve&s;ted; it was a &s;trong popu|lous city, and extremely aver&s;e to the French government. When the king of France appeared with his army, the populace ma&s;&s;acred &s;ome of his &s;ubjects who happened to be in the place; when they were &s;ummoned to &s;urrender, they declared they would defend them&s;elves to the la&s;t extremity, and immediately &s;ent deputies to England to &s;ollicit a&s;&s;i&s;tance. John had, by an emba&s;&s;y to the court of France, &s;ued for peace, which Philip would not grant on any other con|dition, than that of his giving Eleanor in marriage to his younger &s;on, together with all the dominions that he held of the crown of France. Such terms the king of England would not embrace$ the negociation proved fruitle&s;s, and he had re&s;igned all thoughts of defending Normandy; &s;o that he de&s;ired the deputies of Rouen to &s;urrender upon the be&s;t terms they could obtain. Notwith&s;tanding this permi&s;&s;ion, the inhabitants &s;till continued to act bravely in their own defence, until the Barbacan, a fort that covered the bridge, being taken, they agreed with Philip to deliver up the city, if peace &s;hould not be made before the end of the month. As this was not the ca&s;e, they and the other two a&s;&s;ociated cities, took the benefit of the capitulation, and Normandy was re-united to the kingdom of France, after a &s;eparation of two hundred and ninety-two years. Philip likewi&s;e compleated the conque&s;t of Anjou, Maine, and Touraine, ex|cept the ca&s;tle of Chinon, which was gallantly defended by Hubert de Burgh, till the en&s;uing &s;ummer, when he was taken in the place, after having been<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rigord.

<P>Mean while, John &s;eemed utterly in&s;en&s;ible of the damage and di&s;grace which he incurred by the rapid progre&s;s of the French king. He gave him&s;elf up to the enjoyment of his young wife; and &s;eemed to renounce all ac|tive mea&s;ures, except tho&s;e of confi&s;cating the Engli&s;h e&s;tates of the Norman barons, who had &s;ubmitted to the king of France. He likewi&s;e con&s;oled him|&s;elf with the gratification of his per&s;onal animo&s;ity towards John de Courcy, the conqueror, and lord of Ul&s;ter, who had refu&s;ed to do him homage, and openly accu&s;ed him of murder and u&s;urpation. Walter de Lacy and his brother Hugh, were directed to &s;eize the per&s;on of this nobleman; and as they were unable to reduce him by open force, they had recour&s;e to &s;tratagem. Walter invited him to a conference, and fell &s;uddenly upon him with a body of troops prepared for the purpo&s;e; &s;o that after the greate&s;t part of his retinue was &s;lain, he took &s;hel|ter in Hugh's ca&s;tle, into which he was decoyed by the mo&s;t warm profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip. Here, however, Hugh detained him, until John's followers ravaged the lands of the Lacys in &s;uch a manner, that they were obliged to &s;et him at liberty. After his relea&s;e, he defeated them in a pitched battle; but they re|&s;olved to effect by treachery, what they could not obtain by valour. They cor|rupted the integrity of his people, who &s;eized him on Good Friday, while he was employed at his devotion in church, and being delivered to Hugh, he was brought over to England, and committed clo&s;e pri&s;oner to the Tower; while Lacy<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoveden.

<P>King John affected to complain loudly of the noblemen who had left him at Rouen, as if their retreat had occa&s;ioned the lo&s;s of Normandy; and, on this pretence, extorted from them a &s;eventh part of their moveables: he likewi&s;e contrived means for laying impo&s;ts on the convents and pari&s;h churches; and a&s;&s;embled a great council at Oxford, in order to deliberate upon mea&s;ures for retrieving his dominions on the continent. To defray the expence of this expedition, a &s;cutage was charged upon the nobles and military tenants; nor were the prelates and clergy exempted from this burthen. But the&s;e aids were<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. Paris.</NOTE> employed in &s;upplying his own extravagance. During the&s;e tran&s;actions, Ro|bert de Turnham, and Savary de Mauleon, &s;truggled manfully in Poitou,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

In this extremity, the few barons, that &s;till adhered to his intere&s;t in that county, &s;ollicited imme|diate &s;uccour; and John equipped a powerful armament, with a view to cro&s;s the &s;ea in per&s;on. He had already repaired to Port&s;mouth in order to embark, when the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury repre&s;ented the indi&s;cretion of tru&s;ting his per&s;on among the $ickle Poitevins; and of leaving his kingdom defencele&s;s, at a junc|ture when a de&s;cent was threatened by the duke of Louvaine and the count of Boulogne, &s;upported by the king of France. He lent a deaf ear to their re|mon&s;trances, and they entreated him on their knees to relinqui&s;h, or at lea&s;t po&s;tpone the expedition: but finding him &s;till inflexible, they changed their &s;train, and plainly threatened to detain him by force, rather than the country &s;hould be expo&s;ed to ruin by his departure. This menace had an in&s;tantaneous effect: he forthwith promi&s;ed to be ruled by their advice; which was to &s;end his brother William Longuepe&eacute;, earl of Sali&s;bury, with a &s;trong body of forces to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Poitevins. He accordingly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed great part of his troops and ve&s;&s;els; and repaired to Winche&s;ter: but repenting of the &s;tep he had taken, he returned to Port&s;mouth, and immediately embarked. However, his di&s;po&s;ition being more fickle than the weather, he landed near Wareham, in Dor|&s;et&s;hire; and of this attempt made a handle to &s;queeze large &s;ums of money from<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rad.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1206.</NOTE> Guy de Thouars, governor of Brittany, growing jealous of the power of Philip, who had not only conquered the adjoining provinces, but al&s;o formed a &s;trong party among the Bretons, began to wi&s;h that John was re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in the dominions he had lo&s;t, &s;o as to form a ballance again&s;t the exor|bitant power of the French monarch, and confirm Guy's own authority in Bre|tagne, which was at this time very precarious. He had conferred on this &s;ub|ject with his brother Aimery, vi&s;count of Thouars, whom Philip had created &s;ene$chal of the province; and he a&s;&s;enting to Guy's propo&s;al, they formed a &s;mall a&s;&s;ociation of barons, who entertained the &s;ame &s;entiments, and invited John to come over and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. A treaty was immediately concluded, and John embarking with a great army at Port&s;mouth, landed at Rochelle, where he was joined by the two brothers and their forces. But, in&s;tead of re|ducing Brittany to his obedience, he marched directly towards Montauban, in Querc$, belonging to his brother-in-law the count of Tholou&s;e, who had &s;ided with Philip, and, inve&s;ting the place, took it by a&s;&s;ault: on which occa&s;ion the
<PB N="427" REF="4360">

<P>Philip had, upon receiving intimation of John's treaty with Guy de Thouars, invaded Brittany, taken Nantes, and compelled the governor of the province to &s;ubmit: but immediately after his return from this expedition, be|ing informed of John's arrival at Rochelle, he directed his march into Poitou, when hearing the Engli&s;h army was employed in the &s;iege of Montauban, he fortified Mirebeau, Loudun, and &s;ome other places, and then retreated towards Paris. After the reduction of Montauban, John advanced to Angers, which he took and reduced to a&s;hes, after having ravaged all the adjoining country: then he undertook the &s;iege of Nantes; but abandoned the enterprize, and pe|netrated into Thouars, in order to protect Aimery from Philip's re&s;entment. While he lay encamped on this territory, the French king advanced to give him|battle; but John, in&s;tead of hazarding an engagement, &s;ent deputies with pro|po&s;als of peace; both princes agreed to a conference, and in the mean time, John retreated with his army to Rochelle, where he embarked for England. Notwith|&s;tanding this affront offered to Philip, the pope, who&s;e mediation the king of Eng|land<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. Brito. Hi&s;t. de Bret.

</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="26" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>But John, in&s;tead of improving this interval, either in negociation, or preparing for a vigorous war, relap&s;ed into his former idlene&s;s, and &s;eemed wholly to forget that he was at variance with any of his neighbours. Never|thele&s;s, when the truce expired, the Engli&s;h troops &s;urpri&s;ed the &s;trong ca&s;tle of Guerplic, conveniently &s;ituated on the coa&s;t of North Bretagne, for protect|ing troops in landing or embarking: but this place was &s;oon retaken, by Ju|hael de Mayenne, &s;ene&s;chal of Brittany, and the count of S. Pol, who had marched with a reinforcement of French troops to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Bretons. Mean while Philip, with another army, entered Poitou, where he reduced &s;eve|ral towns and ca&s;tles, and Henry Clement, his mare&s;chal, in a rencounter with John's party, took Hugh de Thouars, Henry de Luzignan, and &s;everal other Poitevin barons in the Engli&s;h intere&s;t. This would have proved an irrepa|rable blow, had not pope Innocent again interpo&s;ed his good offices for another truce, which was accordingly concluded. The pope, notwith&s;tanding his quar|tel with John, was very de&s;irous of effecting a durable peace between the two crowns; that the French might not be diverted from the pro&s;ecution of a war<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<HEAD>&sect; XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>Whatever inconvenience attended a war on the continent, it was &s;o far agreeable to John, as it afforded pretences to rai&s;e heavy exactions from his &s;ubjects, with which he gratified his own avarice and extravagance. At his return from Poitou, he a&s;&s;embled a general council, in which the prelates and nobility granted him a &s;ub&s;idy, amounting to a thirteenth of all rents and moveables throughout the nation; and this was levied from the tenants of the clergy, as well as from the laity. Geoffrey, archbi&s;hop of York, in&s;tead of &s;ubmitting to this impo|&s;ition, not only refu&s;ed to pay his proportion; but al&s;o excommunicated all per|&s;ons who &s;hould collect &s;uch a grievous tax upon the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the clergy
<PB N="428" REF="4370">
in his province, and all invaders of eccle&s;ia&s;tical effects; and then withdrew from the kingdom. Notwith&s;tanding this cen&s;ure and pretext, the talliage was actually levied, and Geoffrey's moveables confi&s;cated for his pre&s;umptuous behaviour; but the metropolitans remon&s;trated &s;o warmly again&s;t this expedient of rai&s;ing<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat.

<P>John's character was &s;o irregular and un&s;ettled, that his conduct could not be con&s;i&s;tent or uniform. He was by turns frightened into compli|ance, and provoked into the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate oppo&s;ition. This period gave birth to his quarrel with the pope, which involved him&s;elf and the nation in &s;uch ca|lamities. Hubert, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, dying at his palace, the younger monks of Chri&s;t-church, a&s;&s;embling that very night, cho&s;e Reginald, their &s;ub-prior, for his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, &s;ung Te Deum, and placed him upon the archie|pi&s;copal throne. This new elect &s;et out before morning, with &s;ome of the monks, for Rome, where he hoped to be confirmed; and all concerned in the clande&s;tine election took an oath of &s;ecrecy, on which their &s;ucce&s;s was &s;uppo&s;ed to depend. Reginald, without regarding this obligation, no &s;ooner arrived on the continent than giving way to the dictates of vanity, he promulgated his elevation, as well as the intent of his journey; and, when he arrived at Rome, Innocent refu&s;ed to confirm him, until he &s;hould be better informed of the affair. Mean while he &s;ent a bull to the &s;uffragans of Canterbury, de&s;iring they would not create a di&s;pute on this &s;ubject with the convent of Chri&s;t-church; and when they in&s;i&s;ted upon their right of electing the archbi&s;hop, he heard the cau&s;e before his own tribunal, and declared the right of election ve&s;ted in the convent alone. Mean while the monks concerned in Reginald's election, were incen&s;ed at his folly, in divulging the &s;ecret, and, as the whole order had not been convened for the ceremony, they now united in &s;etting him a&s;ide, and ap|plying to the king for leave to proceed to another election. John granted their reque&s;t without &s;ubjecting them to any re&s;triction; but gave them to under|&s;tand in private, that he &s;hould be extremely plea&s;ed if their choice &s;hould fall upon John de Grey, bi&s;hop of Norwich, who was accordingly elected in all the forms, approved by his maje&s;ty, and put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the temporalities of the archbi&s;hop. Twelve of the monks were deputed to Rome for his confirmation, which, however, the &s;uffragans oppo&s;ed, becau&s;e he had been elevated without their concurrence. Innocent, who&s;e aim was to &s;ubject the church of England to the papal authority, that he might govern and tax it without controul, took this opportunity of annulling both elections, and of preferring a prelate, whom he knew devoted to his de&s;ign.</P>

<P>This pontiff had already, on pretence of relieving the Chri&s;tians in the Holy-Land, laid a tax upon the Engli&s;h church, which being levied without murmurs, he was encouraged to exert the &s;ame power for his own pri|vate advantage. With this view he had, during the vacancy of the metropo|litan &s;ee, &s;ent John Ferentino, as his legate, into England, and a national &s;ynod was called at St. Alban's; though a royal mandate put a &s;top to their proceed|ings: but while John was abroad in Guienne, the legate convoked another at Reading, where he laid an impo&s;ition on the clergy, amounting to a con&s;ider|able &s;um, with which he made his retreat before the king's return.

<P>The ceremony being performed, the pope wrote a courtly letter of recommendation in his favour to the king, whom he pre&s;ented with a few bau|bles to avert his indignation: at the &s;ame time, the monks of Chri&s;t-church were enjoined upon their obedience to receive Langton, as their archbi&s;hop; and other letters were written to the chief nobility, &s;olliciting their good offices with the king, in behalf of that prelate. All the&s;e precautions were in&s;ufficient to appea&s;e the wrath of John, who forthwith &s;ent a body of troops to expel the monks of Canterbury, and hang them &s;hould they refu&s;e to quit the king|dom immediately. They were obliged to embark for Flanders, without delay; their effects were &s;eized, their tenants ejected, and their place &s;upplied with &s;ome monks belonging to the abbey of St. Augu&s;tine. In an&s;wer to the pope's letter, John gave him to under&s;tand, that he was determined to maintain the honour of his crown, and &s;upport the election of the bi&s;hop of Norwich; and that if his holine&s;s &s;hould thwart him in this particular, he would &s;uffer no ap|peals in eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;putes to be carried before any foreign court of judica|ture. Innocent, far from being intimidated by the&s;e menaces, &s;ent or|ders to the bi&s;hops of London, Worce&s;ter, and Ely, to exhort the king, in his name, to receive archbi&s;hop Langton, and recall the monks of Chri&s;t-church; and, in ca&s;e of his refu&s;al, to lay the kingdom under an interdict. John was terrified by the declaration of the&s;e prelates, and offered to obey the pope's order, with a &s;alvo of his rights, dignity, and prerogative: but Innocent would hear of no &s;alvos, or other terms, than his delivery of the regalia, with his own hand, to archbi&s;hop Langton, and his making immediate and full re&s;titution to the convent. The king rejected his propo&s;al, and the three prelates having laid the kingdom under an interdict, retired to the continent, whither they were followed by the bi&s;hops of Bath and Hereford. A &s;top was immediately put to divine &s;ervice, and the admini&s;tration of all the &s;acraments but bapti&s;m: church doors were &s;hut, and the dead buried in ditches and high-ways, with|out the u&s;ual rites or any funeral &s;olemnity. Notwith&s;tanding this interdict, the Ci&s;tertian order continued to perform divine &s;ervice publicly: the cen&s;ure<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann. Waver. Mat. Paris. Ann. Eccl.

<P>John was equally enraged and terrified at the pro&s;pect of being ex|communicated<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1208.</NOTE> by name, and &s;eeing his &s;ubjects ab&s;olved of their allegiance.

&s;u&s;pected of di&s;affection, to demand their children or relations, as ho&s;tages for their fidelity; and they generally complied with his demand: but when tho&s;e officers re$aired to the habitation of William de Braou&s;e, lord of Brecknock|&s;hire, on the &s;ame errand, his wife re&s;olutely told them, &s;he would never tru&s;t her children in the hands of a man who had &s;o ba&s;ely murdered his own nephew and rightful &s;overeign. John was &s;o provoked at this &s;tinging re|proach,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat Paris.</NOTE> that he &s;ent another body of forces to &s;eize the per&s;on of William, who fled into Ireland with his wife and family. The king, in pur&s;uance of his &s;cheme for preventing an in&s;urrection in England, in ca&s;e the pope &s;hould put his threats in execution, re&s;olved to compromi&s;e all di&s;putes with William, king of Scotland, that the rebels might find no a&s;&s;i&s;tance in that kingdom. The Scots being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Berwick, which was the key or pa&s;s to England, had &s;ome time ago committed depredations in Northumberland; and the Engli&s;h, in order to prevent the&s;e inroads, had, at divers times, attempted to erect a fortre&s;s on their own &s;ide of the river, at Twedemouth; but the work was twice inter|rupted by the Scots, who &s;urpri&s;ed the guards, and demoli&s;hed the fortification. William not only countenanced the&s;e outrages, but afforded &s;helter in his domi|nions<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$ Ch 1$$9.</NOTE> to the ma$econtents of England. John therefore made &s;ome overtures of accommodation, and, the&s;e being rejected, marched at the head of a great ar|my to do him&s;elf ju&s;tice by force of ar$s; the Scot po&s;ted him&s;elf at Roxburgh to cover his dominions from in&s;ult: but neither &s;ide being much inclined to a battle, they renewed the negociation, and a peace was concluded, on condition, that the unfini&s;hed ca&s;tle of Twedemouth &s;hould be demoli&s;hed; that John's &s;ons, Henry and Richard, &s;hould e&s;pou&s;e Margaret and I&s;abel, the daughters of William, who were immediately delivered to the king of England, to be educated at his court, together with fifteen thou&s;and marks by way of portion; and that the fealty and homage due to the Engli&s;h monarch, for the lands which the Scotti&s;h king po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in England, &s;hould, for the future, be paid by the prince of Scotland. In con&s;equence of this agreement, William made a for|mal re&s;ignation of tho&s;e lands to John, who be&s;towed the inve&s;titure of them upon young Alexander; and that prince did him homage at Alnewick.

<P>John &s;eemed to think this new &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of his &s;ubjects, entitled him to a de&s;potic power in his government: for he deprived his nobles of their favourite diver&s;ions, by i&s;&s;uing a &s;evere prohibition again&s;t hunting, hawking, and fowling; ordered all the mounds of his fore&s;ts to be levelled, and the ditches to be filled up, that his deer might have free liberty to range about, and eat up the corn and fruits of the hu&s;bandman; and a woman being killed by accident at Ox|ford, he granted a warrant to arre&s;t, and impri&s;oned three innocent clergymen, who were afterwards hanged without any form of trial: an act of oppre&s;&s;ion, in con&s;equence of which three thou&s;and &s;tudents immediately quitted Oxford, &s;o that the place was almo&s;t$totally abandoned. Such outrageous acts of tyranny would have been highly impolitic at any time; but they &s;eemed to be the effect of ab&s;olute frenzy at this juncture, when the &s;entence of excommunication hung over his head, and his people were on the brink of being ab&s;olved from their

allegiance. He had &s;ent the abbot of Beaulieu, a convent of Ci&s;tercians, which he had lately founded in Hamp&s;hire, as his emba&s;&s;ador, to Rome, to avert the pope's indignation, and accommodate all differences with the Roman &s;ee; and Innocent had given in&s;tructions to the bi&s;hops of London, Ely, and Worce&s;ter, to &s;ettle the terms of pacification. The&s;e prelates came over to England by virtue of a &s;afe conduct, and John appointed &s;ome bi&s;hops and no|blemen to treat with them at Can$erbury. The articles were &s;oon adju&s;ted and &s;igned by the deputies on both &s;ides: but John objecting to that, which obliged him to re&s;tore all that had been taken from eccle&s;ia&s;tics, the three prelates re|fu&s;ed to admit of any alteration, and retired to the continent. The king endea|voured to negotiate a more favourable treaty with Langton him&s;elf, who, ar|riving at Dover, was met by Geoffrey Fitzpiers and other noblemen, with pro|po&s;als from John, which he ab&s;olutely rejected, and left the kingdom immedi|ately. He was afterwards invited to return, with promi&s;e of full &s;atisfaction; but he refu&s;ed the invitation; and the three bi&s;hops, delegated by the pope for this purpo&s;e, denounced the &s;entence of excommunication again&s;t the per&s;on of John, king of England. It was publi&s;hed in France; but, though &s;everal Engli&s;h bi&s;hops and abbots were enjoined to promulgate the cen&s;ure in all conventical churches throughout the kingdom, no prelate or clergyman would venture to obey the order. Geoffrey, archdeacon of Norwich, and one of the barons of the Exchequer, ob&s;erving to his colleagues, that it was un&s;afe for be|neficed per&s;ons to continue in the &s;ervice of an excommunicated prince, retired from the bench; but, John, being informed of his declaration, ordered him to be apprehended, impri&s;oned, and loaded with a leaden cope, the intolerable weight of which is &s;aid to have put an end to his life. Hugh, archdeacon of Wells, being preferred to the &s;ee of Lincoln, and having obtained leave to go abroad, and receive con&s;ecration from the archbi&s;hop of Rouen, went directly<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr.

<P>It was on this occa&s;ion, that he exacted va&s;t &s;ums, on pretence of making an attempt to recover Normandy; and of &s;ettling the affairs of Ire|land, which were now in great confu&s;ion. How willing &s;oever the laity might have been to grant &s;ub&s;idies, the clergy were certainly fleeced by dint of violence and extortion: without impo&s;ing a regular tax, he exacted money, by way of compo&s;ition, from mona&s;teries, canons, templars, and ho&s;pitallers; and the Jews were oppre&s;&s;ed with great cruelty. By means of the&s;e extraordinary aids, he rai&s;ed a great army, with which he embarked at Wales for Ireland, and landed &s;afely at Dublin, where he received the homage of above twenty Iri&s;h lords, who went thither to meet and offer him their voluntary allegiance: but as Ca|thol, king of Connaught, refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit, he marched again&s;t that prince, and reduced his whole country.

<P>John, having regulated the affairs of Ireland, returned to Eng|land, and convoking an a&s;&s;embly of all the abbots and chiefs of religious orders through the kingdom, extorted from them above an hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. The Ci&s;tercians, pleading t$eir priviledge, and refu&s;ing to pay their proportion, he fleeced to &s;uch a degree, that almo&s;t all their hou&s;es were redu|ced to beggary, except the convent of Beaulieu in Hamp&s;hire, which he him|&s;elf had founded, as an act of penance for the murder of Arthur, and that of Margam in Glamorgan&s;hire, where he had been &s;umptuou&s;ly entertained in his way to Ireland, and at his return; the&s;e were exempted from the impo&s;itions: but all the other Ci&s;tercians were not only impoveri&s;hed, but debarred all cor|re&s;pondence with their order abroad. Indeed an embargo was laid upon the &s;hip|ping in all the ports of England, to prev$nt an intercour&s;e of per&s;ons between<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch 1211.</NOTE> this kingdom and the continent, without an immediate licence: and a procla|mation was publi&s;hed, requiring all Engli&s;h bi&s;hops and eccle&s;ia&s;tics, re&s;iding in foreign parts, to return at a certain time, otherwi&s;e their benefices would be &s;eized for the king's u&s;e; the prohibition was likewi&s;e renewed, again&s;t all ex|erci&s;e of the papal authority in England, on pain of corporal puni&s;hment. Not contented with &s;etting the pope at defiance, and the contributions he had already received, he laid another talliage on the clergy, to defray the expence of an ex|pedition again&s;t the Wel&s;h, who had made &s;ome incur&s;ions over the Engli&s;h borders.

<P>John, being apprized of this con&s;piracy, without knowing the particular per&s;ons concerned in it, exacted ho&s;tages from all the nobility he &s;u&s;|pected, and by means of the&s;e, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of their ca&s;tles. Stephen Ridel, late keeper of the great feal, was bani&s;hed, and Geoffrey de Norwich, one of John's own chaplains, confined to clo&s;e pri&s;on, where he died; Robert Fitzwalter, who&s;e daughter the king is &s;aid to have poi&s;oned, becau&s;e &s;he would not &s;ubmit to his embraces, fled into France, and Eu&s;tace de Ve&s;ci, his accom|plice in the plot, retired into Scotland.

Influenced by this apprehen&s;ion, he endeavoured to conciliate the affection of his people by &s;ome popular regulations. He made a &s;evere enquiry into the conduct of high &s;heriffs, who had embezzled great part of the public revenue. Some were impri&s;oned, &s;ome were fined, and others fled to avoid pro&s;ecution: he &s;et on foot an examination into the beha|viour of the fore&s;ters, who had committed flagrant acts of oppre&s;&s;ion: the fines they had impo&s;ed were remitted; and they promi&s;ed upon oath, to exact no more than what was u&s;ually paid in the reign of Henry II: a tax laid upon the &s;ea ports, which had produced great clamour, was withdrawn; and the king, affecting compa&s;&s;ion and humanity, received the petitions of the widows<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ C$ 1213.</NOTE> and the poor, and promi&s;ed graciou&s;ly to redre&s;s all their grievances. With a view to decoy the pope into a pacification, he &s;ent other agents to Rome, to $ol$icit an accommodation on the terms which the nuncios had propo&s;ed; and, with re&s;pect to the article of re&s;titution, produced acqu ttances from all the ab|bots, conve$ts, and $$cular clergy, which they had given upon compul&s;ion.

Langton, and his two &s;uffragans, having obtained their de&s;ire in the &s;entence of depo&s;ition, returned to France, in order to in&s;tigate Lewis to execute the pope's mandate; and they found that monarch as forward and &s;anguine as they could have wi&s;hed. He had already formed the de&s;ign of conquering England, and propo&s;ed the enterprize, in a general council of the prelates and nobility at Soi&s;&s;ons, where he found them very well di&s;po&s;ed to em|bark in the undertaking. He had effected a match between his cou&s;in Peter de Dreux, and Alice heire&s;s of Brittany, by which alliance, the whole naval force of that province was at his di&s;po&s;al; he employed a whole year in building &s;hips, and equipping a &s;ufficient armament for an expedition of &s;uch importance. Eu|&s;tace a pyrate, who had been in the &s;ervice of John, de&s;erted to Philip with five &s;tout ve&s;&s;els; he laid an embargo on all &s;hips that were in the ports of France; he a&s;&s;embled a fleet of &s;eventeen hundred &s;ail at Boulogne, and fixed the ren|dezvous of his army at Rouen, where all his barons and va&s;&s;als were or|dered to meet on the twenty-fir&s;t day of April, on pain of being deemed traitors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">M.

<P>Mean while, the king of England wreaked his revenge on Langton and the bi&s;hop of London, by cutting down the woods belonging to the &s;ee of Canterbury, and demoli&s;hing the ca&s;tle of Stor$ord; and having thus exhau&s;ted the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of his choler, began to prepare for oppo&s;ing the inva&s;ion. He ordered all the &s;hips of burthen in England to be brought, by their re&s;pective ma&s;ters, to Port&s;mouth, ready manned, armed, and victualled, there to enter into his pay and &s;ervice, on the twenty-fourth day of March. He appointed Dover, Fever&s;ham, and Ip&s;wich, as places of rendezvous, to which he &s;um|moned all his earls, barons, knights, e&s;quires, and va&s;&s;als, with hor&s;e and armour, before the twenty-fir&s;t day of April, on pain of being branded for cowards and degraded. Such numbers a&s;&s;embled on this occa&s;ion, that by far the greate&s;t part was &s;ent home as unnece&s;&s;ary, though the&s;e were mo&s;tly of the common people. The bi&s;hop of Norwich arrived from his government, with five hundred knights, and the &s;ame number of light cavalry; and the whole force a&s;&s;embled on Barham-Down near Canterbury, amounted to &s;ixty thou&s;and men, well armed and appointed: yet, powerful as this body was, he placed his

<P>During this pau&s;e of expectation, two knights templar arrived with a me&s;&s;age to the king from Pandulf, a&s;&s;uring his maje&s;ty of his hearty de&s;ire to employ his good offices in his behalf, and propo&s;ing a conference to &s;ettle the terms of his reconciliation with the church. John immediately embraced the propo&s;al, and met the legate at Dove$, where, in a conference, Pandulf ex|patiated upon the prodigious armament of Ph lip, the influence of the exiled prelates and nobility, who would accompany that monarch in his expedition, and the di&s;&s;atisfaction of the Engli&s;h, who had invited him to engage in &s;uch an undertaking. John, con&s;cious of his own gui$t and unpopular character, was frightened at the picture he drew: he forthwith &s;u&s;pected every nobleman in his court and army; and his apprehen&s;ions were augmented$ by an idle prophecy of a hermit called Peter of Pontefract, who pretended to foretell that John would be depo&s;ed before the end of the year; a prediction which, whether it was the effect of knavery or &s;uper&s;tition, made a very deep impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of the people, and operated &s;trongly to the prejudice of the king's affairs. In a word, John was &s;o terrified by the&s;e concurring con&s;iderations, that he agreed to the legate's propo&s;als of peace; and &s;wore to the ob&s;ervance of them, in pre&s;ence of the count of Boulogne, the earls of Sali&s;bury, Warrenne, and Ferers, who like|wi&s;e promi&s;ed, upon oath, to concur in the execution of the articles, to the fol|lowing effect: King John &s;hall admit into his favour archbi&s;hop Langton, and be reconciled to the exiled prelates, who &s;hall re&s;ume their functions, and exer|ci&s;e their authority without interruption; Robert Fitzwalter, Eu&s;tace de Ve&s;c$, and all others both of the clergy and laity, concerned in the a&s;&s;ociation, &s;hall be pardoned, and re&s;tored to their honours and e&s;tates; full re&s;titution &s;hall be made of all liberty and property, which hath been taken away in the cour&s;e of this di&s;pute; eight thou&s;and pounds &s;hall be immediately remitted in part of re|&s;titution to the exiled prelates, for the payment of their debts and the expence of their return; and their agents &s;hall be put into immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their effects and temporalities: John &s;hall relea&s;e all homage exacted from their va&s;|&s;als &s;ince the interdict; rever&s;e all &s;entences pronounced again&s;t clergymen or laymen on account of this di&s;pute; and oblige him&s;elf to refrain from i&s;&s;uing writs of outlawry again&s;t churchmen for the future; all di&s;putes about damages<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> &s;hall be determined by the legate, or be referred to the pope's deci&s;ion.</P>

<P>Though this reconciliation with the pope removed all eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ures from the king and kingdom, and freed John from all the odium and danger which attended the re&s;entment of the clergy, it could not prevent the in|va&s;ion of Philip, nor appea&s;e the di&s;contents of the nobility, who had engaged to a&s;&s;i&s;t that monarch in his endeavours to a&s;cend the Engli&s;h throne. The&s;e alarming circum&s;tances &s;till remained; and it required a very extraordinary ex|pedient to prevent the mi&s;chief that m ght en&s;ue. No &s;cheme occurred &s;o fea&s;i|ble as that of putting his kingdom under the protection of the Roman &s;ee, by which it would be &s;creened from all the attempts of chri&s;tian invaders; at lea&s;t it would tran&s;late the odium from John to his enemies; and perhaps the artillery of the church might become as terrible to the monarch of France, as it had been to the king of England. John, finding him&s;elf reduced to the alternative of reigning as a va&s;&s;al to the pope, or of being depo&s;ed altogether, and treated
<PB N="437" REF="4460">
as a murderer, u&s;urper, and tyrant, had no room for he&s;itation. He re&s;olved to do homage to Innocent; and the ceremony was performed in the hou&s;e of the Templars at Dover. He re&s;igned his crown to the pope's legate, and re|ceived it again as a pre&s;ent from the &s;ee of Rome, to which he &s;wore fealty as a va&s;&s;al and feudatory. He obliged him&s;elf and his heirs to pay an acknowledg|ment of the pope's &s;uperiority, and in lieu of &s;ervice, an annual tribute of &s;even hundred marks for the kingdom of England, and three hundred for Ireland: but, even in this act of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, he re&s;erved to him&s;elf and his heirs the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. Paris: Cart. 1$. Joh. Act. Pub.</NOTE> power of admini&s;tring ju&s;tice, and all his rights and regalities. This &s;hame|ful ceremony was performed on A&s;cen&s;ion day, in the mid&s;t of a great concour&s;e of people, who beheld it with &s;hame and indignation. John, in doing homage to the pope, pre&s;ented a &s;um of money to his repre&s;entative, which the proud legate trampled under his feet, as a mark of the king's dependence. Every &s;pectator glowed with re&s;entment, and the archbi&s;hop of Dublin exclaimed aloud again&s;t &s;uch intolerable in&s;olence. Pandulf, not &s;atisfied with this mor|tifying act of &s;uperiority, kept the crown and &s;cepter five whole days, and then re&s;tored them as the &s;pecial favour of the holy &s;ee. John was de&s;pi&s;ed before this extraordinary re&s;ignation; but now he was looked upon as a contemptible wretch, unworthy to &s;it upon the throne: while he him&s;elf &s;eemed altogether in&s;en&s;ible of his di&s;grace; nor did his pride and cruelty abate in con&s;equence of this humiliation: he &s;eemed to triumph in his having pre&s;erved his crown in &s;pite of the prediction of the hermit, who had been impri&s;oned with a view to puni&s;h him, in ca&s;e he &s;hould be found to have deceived the people with a fal&s;e pro|phecy; and now, though it was plainly verified, he ordered him to be hanged as an impo&s;tor.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="44" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XLIV.</HEAD>
<P>Pandulf having obtained this re&s;ignation, which was confirmed by the oaths of twelve principal barons, and three prelates, together with a char|ter exempting clergymen from outlawry, and the &s;um of eight thou&s;and pounds for the exiled bi&s;hops; he retired to the continent without removing the interdiction, or ab&s;olving John of his excommunication. Philip, who had un|dertaken this expedition at the in&s;tances of the pope, and expended an immen&s;e &s;um in the naval armament he had prepared for the conque&s;t of England, was extremely chagrined when the legate informed him of the tran&s;action be|tween him and John, at Dover, and cautioned him again&s;t invading the patri|mony of St. Peter. He knew the con&s;equence of an interdict, and &s;entence of excommunication. This very re&s;ignation was a recent example of the papal authority; but, at the &s;ame time, he was &s;en&s;ible of having a great advantage over John, in the affection and e&s;teem of his &s;ubjects; and re&s;olved to pro&s;e|cute the war in &s;pite of the pope and all his cen&s;ures. He would not, however, make a de&s;cent upon England, until he &s;hould reduce Ferrand, count of Flan|ders, John's ally, who might invade his dominions in his ab&s;ence; and there|fore he began his march along the coa&s;t from Calais, while his fleet &s;upplied him with provi&s;ions, as he advanced. Having reduced Ca&s;&s;el, Ypres, and &s;ome other places, he undertook the &s;iege of Bruges, and his navy lay at anchor at Damme, about two leagues from the place. Ferrand, in this emergency, &s;ollicited &s;uccours from England; and John &s;ent immediately to his relief, a fleet of five hundred large &s;hips, well provided, be&s;ides eight hundred &s;maller ve&s;&s;els, with &s;even hundred knights, and a great body of forces, under the com|mand
<PB N="438" REF="4470">
of W. Longue-Ep&eacute;e, earl of Sali&s;bury, and Renaud, count of Boulogne. When they approached the French fleet at Damme, it appeared &s;o numerous, that they were &s;tartled, and began to think it would be impracticable to attack it with any probability of &s;ucce&s;s; but, receiving i$t$lligence, that almo&s;t all the French forces were on &s;hore, employed in the &s;iege of Ghent, which Philip had undertaken after the reduction of Bruges, they attacked the &s;hipping with great fury, took above three hundred ve&s;&s;els laden with provi&s;ions, arms, and ammu|nition; burned an hundred that ran a$&s;h$re, while the re&s;t, being farther out at &s;ea, &s;aved them&s;elves by flight. The Engli&s;h, flu&s;hed w$th this &s;ucce&s;s, landed in order to reduce Damme, and de&s;troy the ve&s;&s;els that were in the harbour; but they met with &s;uch a warm reception from a body of French forces, which Philip had detached to the place at their fir&s;t appearance on the coa&s;t, that they were obliged to re-imbark with precipitation, and con&s;iderable lo&s;s. This advantage was too trivial to con&s;ole the French king for the damage he had $u&s;|tained. His de&s;ign upon England was ab&s;olutely de&s;eated: he ordered $ is re|maining &s;hips, that were in the harbour of Damme, to be unloaded and &s;et on fire, that they might not fall into the hands of the Engli&s;h: he exacted ho&s;|tages from Ghent, Ypres, and Bruges, for the payment of the ran&s;om to which<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer. Mat. Paris. R$gord. $nr Dunft. G. B$to.</NOTE> they agreed, and marched back to his own dominions. Ferrand, who had retired to Holland, imm$diately return$d with a body of forces, and recovered all the places which had been taken; a ta&s;k facilitat$d by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Engli&s;h, and the favour of the inhabitants.</P>

<P>Philip's expedition to E$gland being defeated for one year, John di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the troops he had a&s;&s;embled for the protection of the coa&s;t, and pro|jected, in his turn, an inva&s;ion o$ France on the &s;ide of Flanders, by Ferrand, reinforced with part of the Engli&s;h troops already in that country; and the emperor Otho promi&s;$d to furni&s;h a con&s;iderable army for that purpo&s;e; while John h$m&s;elf propo&s;ed to land in Po$tou, and attack France on that quar|ter. With this view he &s;ummoned his baro$s, knights, and va&s;&s;als, to meet him at Port&s;mouth; but they refu&s;ed to fight under $is banners, until he &s;hould be ab&s;olved from the &s;entence of excommunication. He, therefore, wrote to Langton, and the exiled bi&s;hops, to come over with all expedition; &s;ent an ho|nourable convoy to con$uct them into the ki$gdom, together with lette$s from four and twenty noblemen, who promi$e$ to pr$tect them from all damage or in&s;ult. Thus &s;oll cited, a&s;&s;ured, and attended, they landed at Dover, and$ re|pairing to Winche&s;ter, were, in their wa$ to the cathedral, met by the king, who accompained them to the chapter-hou&s;e of the conv$nt, wh$re the arch|bi&s;hop obliged the king to renew h$s oath of fealty to pope I$nocent, to &s;wear he would love, defend, and maintain church and cl$rgy, again&s;t all their adver|&s;aries; that he would revive the laws of k$ng Fdward; and make full re$titu|tion before Ea&s;ter to all concerned in the interdict, on pain of rel$p&s;ing into the &s;entence of excommunication. This oath b$ing taken, John was led to the church door, where he was publ$cly ab&s;olved; and next day he i&s;&s;ued out precepts, ordering four re&s;pon&s;ible men, with the reeve$ to come from every<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$$.

for the future to avoid intermeddling in their affairs. Whenever a &s;ee became vacant, he granted the Cong&eacute; d'Elire to fi$l it up, and left the election entirely to the chapters a$ convents, without pre&s;uming to recommend any particular per&s;on. Perhaps this tamene&s;s encouraged the in&s;olence of Langton, who, though he had never received the lea&s;t provocation from John, &s;eems to have come over with a view, not only to augment the papal authority, but al&s;o to embroil the nation, and di&s;tre&s;s the king's affairs. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the pride, arrogance, and turbulent di&s;po&s;ition, of Becket, who&s;e example he affected to imitate: he gra&s;ped at the di&s;po&s;al of all eccle&s;ia&s;tical dignities, and wanted to act as &s;overeign, even in civil affairs. The ceremony of John's ab&s;olution being performed, and every other nece&s;&s;ary &s;tep taken for the &s;atisfaction of the cler|gy, that prince returned to Port&s;mouth in order to pro&s;ecute his expedition; but his va&s;&s;als having already attended the greate&s;t part of the forty days they were obliged to &s;erve, gave him to under&s;tand, that their money was almo&s;t ex|hau&s;ted, and they could not proceed without a &s;upply from his exchequer. This propo&s;al he rejected, and on the &s;uppo&s;ition that they would follow him of their own accord, embarked with his own hou&s;hold, and &s;et &s;ail for the i&s;land of Jer&s;ey. He had appointed Geoffrey Fitzpiers, and Peter, bi&s;hop of Win|che&s;ter, regents of the realm in his ab&s;ence, and enjoined them to con&s;ult the arch$i&s;hop of Canterbury in all affairs of con&s;equence. The&s;e ju&s;ticiaries &s;um|moned a council at St. Albans, where the king's peace was proclaimed, reviv|ing the laws of Henry I. abrogating tho&s;e that were oppre&s;&s;ive, aboli&s;hing ale|&s;chots, or drinking booths, kept by fore&s;ters to extort money, on pretence of informing again$t the people for tran&s;gre$&s;ions; and forbidding, on &s;evere pe|nalties, all &s;heriffs, fore&s;ters, and other officers of the crown, to extort money, on any prete$$e what&s;oever.</P>

<P>Immediately after this council, John returned from Jer&s;ey tran&s;|ported with indignation again&s;t the barons, who had refu&s;ed to &s;erve in the ex|pedition; and as the&s;e were gene$ally from the north, he forthwith a&s;&s;embled an army in order to cha&s;ti&s;e them for their di&s;obe$ience. With this view he had advanced as far as Northampton, where he was overtaken by Langton, who forbade him to proceed, ob&s;erving, that he could not make war without the con&s;ent of his clergy, unle&s;s he had a mind to infringe the oath he had taken at his a$&s;olution. John replied, that this was a &s;ecular affair, in which the clergy had no concern, and next day continued his march to Nottingham; but thither $e was pur&s;ued by the archbi&s;hop, who threatened to excommunicate him and all his followers, unle&s;s they would immediately de&s;i&s;t from this enterprize; and John was fain to comply. He di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his troops, and &s;ummoned the barons to an&s;wer in his court, which was held at Wallingford; and t$ere he was recon|ciled to them through the mediation of cardinal Nich$las, bi&s;hop of Fra&s;cate, who had ju&s;t arrived in England, as the pope's legate a latere, to adju&s;t the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cler. $u$&s;t Ann.

<P>This prelate was &s;$nt over, at John's reque&s;t, by the bi&s;hop of Norwi$h, whom he had &s;ent amba&s;&s;ador to Otho, and directed to proce$d from the imperial court to Rome, with complaints again&s;t Langton, who had entered into a con&s;piracy with the nobility again&s;t the king. At a &s;y|nod of his prelates and clergy convened in St. Paul's, on pretence of examining the lo&s;&s;es of the exiled bi&s;hops, Langton had conferred privately with a number
<PB N="440" REF="4490">
of barorns, and formed an a&s;&s;ociation again&s;t John, from whom they intended to extort conce&s;&s;ions, in the name of their ancient liberties, according to the charter granted by Henry I. at his coronation. John had received &s;ome intima|tion of this con&s;piracy, which was confirmed by the oaths of all parties con|cerned, who &s;wore to a&s;&s;ert tho&s;e liberties with their lives and fortunes, while the archbi&s;hop promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t them with all his eccle&s;ia&s;tical power and influ|ence: this was the cau&s;e of the king's march, and this was the &s;pring that actu|ated Langton in his efforts to fru&s;trate the expedition. The pope, who&s;e inte|re&s;t it was to maintain this weak prince upon the throne, e&s;pou&s;ed h$s cau&s;e with great &s;incerity; ordered his legate Nicholas to de&s;troy the letters and bulls again&s;t John, which had been tru&s;ted to the charge of Langton, and wrote to the king, a&s;&s;uring him of his favour and protection, provided he would avoid all di&s;putes with the bi&s;hops and clergy: at the &s;ame time he &s;ent letters to the king of Scotland and the nobility, conjuring them to pre&s;erve their allegiance<NOTE PLACE="marg">$$mer's Foe|$$$$. $word$ P$$$.</NOTE> to John, as a prince under the immediate protection of the holy &s;ee; and the le|gate was directed to annul all con&s;piracies and a&s;&s;ociations formed on account of the interdict.</P>

<P>Nicholas, immediately after his arrival, received the king's homage in the church of St. Paul, together with the fir&s;t year's tribute of a thou&s;and marks, according to a new in&s;trument of John's r$&s;ignation and fealty, &s;ealed with a golden bu$l. The prelates and nobility were a&s;&s;embled, as well for this ceremony, as with a view to fix the e&s;timate of the damages, which was at|tended with &s;ome difficulty from the contradictory accounts that were produced by the king's officers, and the commi&s;&s;ioners of the exiled prelates. John of|fered to pay, in the mean time, an hundred thou&s;and marks, and give &s;ecurity for what further $$m &s;hould be found due, after a candid inqui&s;ition. But this propo&s;al was rejected by the bi&s;hops, who wanted to protract the affair, until the king &s;hould be tired into a compliance with all their demands. Accordingly, it was canva&s;ied in three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive councils, ti$l at length, in an a&s;&s;embly at Reading, the bi&s;hops accepted fifteen thou&s;and marks in part of their demands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>While the legate was employed in this vi&s;itation, John, being pro&s;&s;ed by his foreign allies to fulfil his engagements, re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute his expedi|tion to Poitou, according to the promi&s;e he had made to Raymund, count of Tholou&s;e, and Guy, count of Auvergne. Raymond, together with the counts of Flanders and Boulogne, had vi&s;ited him in the winter to receive their pen&s;ions, and concert the operations of the en&s;uing campa$gn. The emperor Otho had promi&s;ed to $oin the count of $lan$ers, in order to invade France from that quarter, and John re&s;olved to &s;end thither the earl of Sali&s;bury with a body of forces; while he him&s;elf &s;hould carry the war into Poitou, in conjunction with his friends of that province. Having therefore made the nece&s;&s;ary preparations, and left Peter, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;te$, as ju&s;ticia$y of the realm, which was likewi&s;e put under the legate's protection, he &s;et &s;ail from Port&s;mouth in the beginning of February, and about the middle of the month landed at Rochelle.

Thus did John lo&s;e by his cowardice all the footing he had gained in Anjou; while his allies in Flanders &s;u&s;tained a total defeat from Philip, at Bo|vines; where the emperor Otho, being vanqui&s;hed in a pitched battle, narrowly e&s;caped captivity; and the counts of Flanders, Holland, and Boulogne, with the earl of Sali&s;bury, were taken pri&s;oners. This victory, obtained over an ar|my of one hundred and forty thou&s;and men, effectually prevented a revolt, which had been concerted by &s;ome of the French nobility with the barons of Anjou, Maine, and Normandy. They now de&s;paired of &s;ucce&s;s; and Philip, marching immediately into Poitou, received at Loudun the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the vi&s;count de Thouars, to whom he was reconciled, by the mediation of Peter de Dreux, duke of Brittany. John, &s;eeing all his &s;chemes bla&s;ted, and terrified at Philip's progre&s;s, &s;ollicited the good offices of Robert de Cur&s;on, an Engli&s;h|man, who re&s;ided at the court of France as the pope's legate, a&s;&s;uring him that he intended to undertake an expedition for the relief of the Chri&s;tians in the Ho|ly Land. Robert employed his intere&s;t and remon&s;trances &s;o effectually, that the French king agreed to a truce for five years, during which every thing &s;hould remain, on each &s;ide, in its pre&s;ent &s;ituation; and, Robert de Dreux be|ing exchanged for the earl of Sali&s;bury, John returned to England, after a very<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

<P>During his ab&s;ence, a di&s;pute had ari&s;en between the legate Nicholas and the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, from which he reaped &s;ome advantage. Lang|ton taking umbrage at the other's filling up all the eccle&s;ia&s;tical vacancies, with|out his concurrence, a&s;&s;embled his &s;uffragans at Dun&s;taple, and, with their con|&s;ent, inhibited Nicholas from &s;upplying the vacancies within the province of Canterbury, appealing to the pope from any &s;tep he &s;hould take contrary to this exhibition. The legate paying no regard to this declaration, continued to fill up the vacant benefices; and, in the mean time, di&s;patched Pandulf to op|po&s;e the appeal at the court of Rome. Innocent was already prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed again&s;t Langton and his &s;uffragans, who, he under&s;tood, made a practice of embezz$ing the greate&s;t part of the Peter-pence, collected within their re&s;pective dioce&s;es;
<PB N="442" REF="4510">
he had even directed Nicholas to call them to account for this alienation, and compel them to refund, by dint of eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ures, if they &s;hould be found nece&s;&s;ary; and now Pandulf giving a favourable account of John's conduct, and a di&s;advantageous idea of Langton's turbulence and pride, the pope be|lieved every &s;ugge&s;tion to their prejudice. Indeed he was influenced by more &s;ub&s;tantial proofs than bare a&s;&s;ertion. He &s;aw the golden bull of re&s;ignation and homage; touched the fir&s;t annual payment, and was a&s;&s;ured that Nicholas freely exerci&s;ed his legarine powers, without any interruption from the crown. He therefore lent a deaf ear to all the repre&s;entations of the archbi&s;hop's bro|ther, Simon Langton, and the other agents &s;ent to ju&s;tify the appeal; and favoured John with a grant, exempting his per&s;on from excommunication, and his royal chapel from an interdict, without a &s;pecial mandate from his holi|ne&s;s;<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ P$r. $word$.</NOTE> &s;o that he could no longer be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the cen&s;ures of the metropo|litan. At the &s;ame time, he directed Nicholas to de$iver the nation from the interdict, upon John's giving &s;ecurity for paying twelve thou&s;and pounds a year to Langton and the other bi&s;hops who had been exiled, until the whole &s;hould amount to forty thou&s;and marks, at which he rated their damages. The legate, in con&s;equence of this order, convoked a council at St. Paul's, and John finding &s;ureties for what remained unpaid, the interdict, which had continued &s;ix years, was removed, to the un&s;peakable joy of the nation in general; though<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat.

<P>This di&s;pute was no &s;ooner terminated, than the nation was involved in other troubles of far greater con&s;equence. The barons of Langton's con&s;piracy a&s;|&s;embled, on pretence of devotion, at St. Edmund&s;bury, where they bound them&s;elves by oath at the great altar, to demand of the king the confi$mation of their liber|ties contained in the charter of Henry I. and the laws to which it referred; and to compel him to do them ju&s;tice by force of arms, &s;hould he refu&s;e to com|ply with their reque&s;t. Pur&s;uant to this obligation, they repaired in the begin|ning of January to London, in a military garb and equipage, and pre&s;ented their demand to the king, ob&s;erving, that he had promi&s;ed to grant it, when he<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$. C$. 1215</NOTE> was ab&s;olved at Winche&s;ter. Far from complying with their reque&s;t, the king re&s;ented their pre&s;umption, and in&s;i&s;ted upon their promi&s;ing under their hands and &s;eals, that they never would demand or ext$rt &s;uch liberties, either from him or his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors: but, finding that all the roblemen a$out his per&s;on, except two or three, refu&s;ed to obey this order, as an unprecedented act of power; and that the other barons were not only inflexible, but already prepared to &s;up|port their petition with force of arms; he began to be apprehen&s;ive of his per|&s;on, and, in order to gain time, de&s;ired he might defer his an&s;wer, upon &s;uch<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ma$ Paris.</NOTE> an important affair, till the latter end of Ea&s;ter, when they &s;hould have &s;ati&s;|faction. The reigns of weak princes have always been favourable to the na|tural rights of mankind. Liberty has often &s;prung from de&s;poti&s;m and u&s;ur|pation. A king con&s;cious of his own weak title to the throne, is glad to com|pound with his &s;ubjects. A tyrant drives them to de&s;pair, in con&s;equence of which they &s;ometimes recover their freedom. The Saxon barons enjoyed original priviledges from a fair compact between the people and the king, on whom they conferred the &s;overeign authority. The Normans had no title
<PB N="443" REF="4520">
to the benefit of tho&s;e laws, which were infringed by the very nature of their tenure; for they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed their lands by the ejectment of the rightful propri|etors; but Henry I. reconciled them to his u&s;urpation by granting this charter, which he never intended to ob&s;erve. The &s;ame bait had been offered to them by Stephen, for the &s;ame rea&s;on; and though he had likewi&s;e neglected the per|formance of his promi&s;e, they looked upon the&s;e grants and promi&s;es as legal rights to be a&s;&s;erted with the fir&s;t convenient opportunity. They could never have found a more favourable conjuncture, than the reign of a weak, capricious prince, like John, univer&s;ally hated and de&s;pi&s;ed by his &s;ubjects.</P>

<P>He was very &s;en&s;ible of the dangerous predicament in which he &s;tood, and began to take precautions again&s;t the impending mi&s;chief. He exacted a new oath of allegiance from all per&s;ons throughout England: he courted the fa|vour of the clergy by granting a charter, e&s;tabli&s;hing the right of free elections in all churches, mona&s;teries, cathedrals, and conventical &s;ocieties; a&s;&s;umed the cro&s;s that he might enjoy the benefit and priviledge annexed to tho&s;e, who dedi|cated them&s;elves to the &s;ervice of God again&s;t the infidels; and &s;ent William Mauclere to Rome, to complain of the con&s;piracy, and crave the pope's parti|cular protection. The barons, at the &s;ame time, di&s;patched Eu&s;tace de Ve&s;cy, and other agents, to ju&s;tify their conduct, and &s;oll$cit the mediation of his ho|line&s;s, towards the recovery of their undoubted rights and priviledges; they a&s;|&s;ured the pope, that not only the northern barons, who fir&s;t avowed the de|mand, were concerned in the confederacy, but it was the general cau&s;e of the whole nation; and in order to engage him in their behalf, they exaggerated their own merit in &s;upporting the liberty of the church, while the kingdom laboured under the interdict. Innocent, who con&s;idered John as his own pupil, whom he could at all times govern, wrote letters to the prelates and barons of England, reproaching Langton and the bi&s;hops for favouring the&s;e di&s;&s;en&s;ions, and com|manding them to promote peace between the parties: he exhorted the barons to &s;ue the king in humble manner, in which ca&s;e he would interpo&s;e his good offices in favour of all their ju&s;t petitions; but in the mean time he annulled their a&s;&s;ociation, and forbade them to engage in any &s;uch confederacy for the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

<P>Neither bi&s;hops nor barons paid the lea&s;t regard to the pope's remon|&s;trance, or to John's privilege of pilgrimage. They reviled him as a &s;canda|lous va&s;&s;al of the pope, to whom he had given up the independency of the kingdom. They employed all their arts and emi&s;&s;aries to kindle a &s;pirit of re|volt in the nation; and as every baron &s;aw his own advantage connected with the &s;ucce&s;s of their &s;cheme, there was hardly a nobleman of any con&s;equence in the kingdom, who did not either per&s;onally engage in the de&s;ign, or at lea&s;t wi&s;h well to the undertaking. The confederates appointed their rendezvous in Ea&s;ter-week at Stamford, where they a&s;&s;embled to a prodigious number of hor&s;e and foot; and marched to Bruckley, about five leagues di&s;tant from Ox|ford, where John at that time re&s;ided. Hearing of their approach, he &s;ent the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, the earl of Pembroke, and others of his coun|cil, to know the particulars of their demands, and they delivered a &s;chedule, containing their ancient rights and priviledges, extracted from Henry's charter, and the laws of Edward the Confe&s;&s;or. The&s;e were deemed &s;o exorbitant by

John, that he expre&s;&s;ed his wonder, they had not a&s;ked the kingdom and all; and flatly ref$&s;ed to comply with their de&s;ire. Then they cho&s;e Robert Fitz|walter for their general, cignifying him with the title of mare&s;chal, or con&s;table, of the army of God and h$ly church; and advanced to Northampton, the $a&s;tle of which they could not take for want of military engines. Thence they moved to Bedford ca&s;tle, into which they were admitted by Wil$iam Beau|champ: and there they received advices from London, importing, that if they could come directly to that capital, they might reduce it without oppo&s;ition. In pur&s;uance of this intelligence they made another motion to Ware, and marching a$l night arrived at Lon$on early on Sunday morning. Finding the gates open, they entered by Aldgate, and, being joined by their friends, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city, while great part of the inhabitants was employed at their devotions. Their guards and &s;tations being properly di&s;po&s;ed, and all &s;u&s;picious per&s;ons &s;e|cured, they wrote circular letters to all the nobility and gentlemen, who had not yet declared in their favour; inviting them to e&s;pou&s;e their cau&s;e, and fight for their liberties; and threatening in ca$e of refu&s;al, to de&s;troy their ca&s;tles and e&s;tates; an alternative which had &s;uch an effect upon tho&s;e to whom it was<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

<P>When they rejected John's offers to aboli&s;h any evil cu&s;toms which might have been introduced in his reign, or in that of his brother Richard, and to redre&s;s their grievances by the advice of his council, he appealed to Lang|ton and his &s;uffragans, de&s;iring them to fulminate the thunder of the church upon tho&s;e who had taken arms again&s;t a prince engaged in the cru&s;ade, who&s;e per&s;on and dominions were accounted &s;acred. Pandulph thought his reque&s;t was rea&s;onable: but the archbi&s;hop declared, he would not pa&s;s any cen&s;ure upon the barons, while John expre&s;&s;ed a &s;u&s;picion of the fidel$ty of his own &s;ubjects, in &s;ending for a body of mercenary auxi$iaries from the continent; tho' if he would d$mi&s;s tho&s;e foreigners, he would not only excommunicate his enemies, but even join him per&s;onally in oppo&s;ing them. Langton him&s;elf was at the head of the confederacy, and made this propo&s;al on purpo&s;e to deprive John of all foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The &s;cheme &s;ucceed$d. The k$ng di&s;banded a great body of Ger|mans and Flemings, whom he had retained in his &s;ervice: but &s;t$ll the arch|bi&s;hop refu&s;ed to excommunicate the revolt$ng barons. Finding him&s;elf thus $utwitted and betrayed, and the de$ection almo&s;t univer&s;al, he thought it was better to r$ign as a limited prince, t$an &s;$crifice his crown, and perhaps his life, to the pr$r$gative. He offered to refer the di&s;pute to four noblemen cho&s;en f$om each $arty, und$r the arbitrat on of the pope; and this propo&s;al being re|jected$ he &s;ubmitted at di&s;cretion, promi&s;ing to grant their demands, and de|&s;iri$g they would meet his commi&s;&s;ioners to conclude the treaty on Runnamede, between Staines and Wind&s;or. There the barons appeared with a va&s;t number of knights and warriors, on the fifteenth day of June, and commi&s;&s;ioners on b$th &s;id$s be$ng appointed, the conferences began: but as the king's agents were genera$ly in the intere&s;t of the barons, no debates en&s;ued; and, in a few days, by the medi$tion of Langton, they adju&s;t$d the articles o$ the two famous char|ters, called Magna Charta and Charta de Fore&s;ta, which are the found$tion of the Engli&s;h liberty and con&s;tituion; or rather the confirmation and augmenta|tion

<P>The&s;e articles being e&s;tabli&s;hed, a number of the nobility applied to John for the reftitution of lands, and the government of ca&s;tles which belonged to them by hereditary right, and he appointed an inqui&s;ition to examine their preten&s;ions; but, in the mean time, he gave up the ca&s;tle of Roche&s;ter to arch|bi&s;hop Langton, as a government which of old belonged to the &s;ee of Canter|bury.

Neverthele&s;s they would not comply with his de&s;ire, of having a certificate of this homage under their hands and &s;eals; and he was not a little alarmed at their refu&s;al.

<P>The more caution they had u&s;ed to hamper that prince, he grew the more impatient under his re&s;trictions, and burned with de&s;ire to &s;hake off the di&s;graceful fetters with which he had been &s;hackled.

he felt all the bitterne&s;s of di&s;appointed hate; he became contemptible in his own eyes; grew &s;olitary, &s;ilent, and re&s;erved; and was overwhelmed with the mo&s;t melancholy chagrin: this was encrea&s;ed by the outragious behaviour of &s;ome barons and other turbulent people, who, di&s;liking the treaty, endeavoured to re|involve the kingdom in confu&s;ion. They plundered the countries through which they pa&s;&s;ed; maltreated the &s;heriffs and other officers employed to collect the revenue; burned the king's hou&s;es, demoli&s;hed his park walls, cut down his woods, and &s;eemed intent upon provoking him to a renewal of ho&s;tilities. The&s;e violences, which were chiefly committed in the north, alarmed the bi&s;hops to &s;uch a degree, that they propo&s;ed a meeting with the king at Oxford, in order to take effectual mea&s;ures for the pre&s;ervation of the peace. There the barons ap|peared with a va&s;t train of followers; but John &s;ent deputies to complain of the injuries he had received, and excu&s;e his not coming in per&s;on to an a&s;&s;embly, in which he did not think his life would be &s;ecure. They afterwards met at Staines, where his commi&s;&s;ioners prote&s;ted, in his name, again&s;t the infractions of the treaty, and conjured the bi&s;hops to publi&s;h the &s;entence of excommuni|cation again&s;t all who di&s;turbed the peace of the king and kingdom; which &s;en|tence John had obtained of the pope, to whom he had appealed in private im|mediately after the confirmation of the charters.

That pontiff received the&s;e tidings with equal &s;urprize and indignation; he inveighed again&s;t the pre&s;umption of the barons, who had dared to extort &s;uch charters from a va&s;&s;al of the Roman &s;ee, and take arms again&s;t their own &s;ove|r$ign, even while he was intitled to a particular veneration as the &s;oldier of Chri&s;t. He &s;$ore that their in&s;olence &s;hould not pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed; he annulled the two charters, relea&s;ed the king from his oath, wrote letters to the barons, com|manding them to recede from the privileges they had extorted; and his orders being neglected, fulminated a &s;entence of excommunication again&s;t them, and di|rected cardinal Langton to publi&s;h the bull. This publication was what the king's agents now demanded: but Langton, pretending the pope had been mi&s;informed, refu&s;ed to o$$y the mandate, until he &s;hould have in&s;ormed his holine&s;s of the whole tran&s;action. Upon his refu&s;al, Pandulf and the bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, the pope's commi&s;&s;aries, publ$&s;hed the bull, and &s;u&s;pended the archbi&s;hop, accord|ing to the orders they had received.

Hugh de Boves is &s;$id to have en $&s;ted forty thou&s;and men, with whom he embarked at Calais; but, being overtaken by a &s;torm, the whole fleet was de&s;troyed, and every individual peri&s;hed. Notwith&s;tanding this di&s;a&s;ter, John a&s;&s;embled &s;uch an army of Germans, Brabantins, and Flemings at Dover, that he found him&s;elf in a conditien to take the field again&s;t the barons. With tho&s;e auxi iaries, he inve&s;ted the ca&s;tle of Roche&s;ter, which Robert Fitzwalter attempted ineffectual y to relieve; the bridges were brok$n down, and all the ports occupied in &s;uch a manner by the enemy, that he was obliged to return to London. William d'Albiney the governor, made an ob&s;tinate defence for two months, during which, provi&s;ions failing, the garri&s;on ate all the hor&s;es in the ca&s;tle; till at length, even this re|&s;ource was exhau&s;ted, and the defences being ruined by the military engines of the be&s;iegers, he &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion. John was &s;o incen&s;ed at the lo&s;s he had &s;u&s;tained before the place, that he would have put all the garri&s;on to death without exception, had not he been diverted from this barbarous purpo&s;e by Sa|vary de Mauleon, who repre&s;ented that the barons would undoubtedly make a retaliation, &s;o that a barbarous practice would be introduced to the di&s;grace of humanity, and the prejud ce of his maj$&s;ty's affairs. Thus advi&s;ed, he &s;$nt William d'Albiney, and the other pri&s;oners of quality, to different ca&s;tles, and ordered all the common &s;oldiers, except the c$o&s;s-bow men, to be hanged in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Knyghton.</NOTE> terrorem.</P>

<P>This was a terrible blow to the confederacy; and the pope's &s;econd bull of excommunication arriving at the &s;ame time, &s;truck &s;uch a damp upon the party, that it was de&s;erted by &s;ome of its mo&s;t con&s;iderable &s;upports, and in particular by Gilbert Fitz-Rainfroy, and the con&s;tab$e of Che&s;ter, who re|tu$ned<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> to the king's &s;ervice. John, after the reduction of Roche&s;ter, found his affairs in &s;uch a flouri&s;hing condition, that he formed two &s;trong armies, with one of which he marched to the northward, leaving the other under the com|mand of the earl of Sali&s;bury and Falca&s;ius de Breant, who reduced the ca&s;tles of Bed$ord, Hun&s;lape, and Tunbridge, and having &s;upplied tho&s;e of Wind&s;or, Berkham&s;tede, and Hertford, with &s;trong garri&s;ons, to hamper the Londoners,

marched into E&s;&s;ex, where they reduced the ca&s;tles and plundered the lands be|longing to the revolted barons. John proceeded in the &s;ame manner in his march, till he arrived at Nottingham, from whence he &s;ummoned the &s;trong ca&s;tle of Belvoir to &s;urrender, threatening, in ca&s;e of a refu&s;al, to put the owner, William d'Albiney, to death; and the governor delivered it up without capi|tulation. The foreign mercenaries committed horrible cruelties in their march, and ravaged the country in a dreadful manner. The&s;e outrages provoked and exa&s;perated the nobility of York&s;hire, who leaving their e&s;tates at the mercy of tho&s;e bloodhounds, retired to Scotland, where they did homage and &s;wore fealty, in the chapter-hou&s;e of Melro&s;s, to Alexander, king of that country. That prince, though no more than eighteen years of age, had already made an irruption into England, and received the oath from the malecontent barons of Northum|berland. John pur&s;ued them in their retreat, and, as if he had been marching in the territories of &s;ome barbarous de&s;potic enemy, laid wa&s;te the whole country as he advanced. The ca&s;tles of the fugitives were &s;ecured by garri&s;ons; the &s;eats, farms, villages, and towns, were pillaged and utterly de&s;troyed; the noblemen of Northumberland followed tho&s;e of York&s;hire into Scotland; the towns of Milford, Morpeth, Alnwick, and Werk, were reduced to a&s;hes; and Rox|burg, Berwick, Haddington, and Dunbar, underwent the &s;ame fate, by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch.

Hav|ing thus de&s;olated a va&s;t tract of country, and reduced all the ca&s;tles belonging to the northern barons, except one in York&s;hire belonging to Robert de Ros, he committed the government of the whole country, between the Tee&s;e and the Tweed, to Hugh de Baliol and Philip de Hulcote, with a good body of forces to over-awe the malecontents, and marched in per&s;on to the borders of Wales, where he reduced a good number of ca&s;tles, &s;ome of which he demoli&s;hed, and others he &s;ecured with &s;trong garri&s;ons.</P>

<P>The barons were now reduced to a deplorable &s;ituation. In&s;tead of recovering their privileges, they &s;aw their e&s;tates ravaged, and parcelled out among foreigners, and the king triumphing in the vengeance he had taken. In this emergency, they were in their turn in&s;pired with the fury of revenge, and took a de&s;perate re&s;olution which had well nigh been productive of their own &s;lavery and their country's ruin. They &s;ent deputies to Philip, king of France, with an offer of the crown to his &s;on Lewis, provided he would come over and a&s;&s;i&s;t them with a force &s;ufficient to dethrone the tyrant by whom they were op|pre&s;&s;ed. This was a very agreeable invitation to the French king, who waited only for an opportunity to re&s;ume the de&s;ign of annexing England to his dominions; he therefore embraced the propo&s;al of the barons, of whom, however, he de|manded five and twenty ho&s;tages for the performance of their promi&s;e, and the&s;e being &s;ent over, he began to prepare in earne&s;t for the expedition. John, at his<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai.</NOTE> return from the north, hovered about London, as if he meant to be&s;iege that city, &s;o that the barons demanded an immediate reinforcement. Philip &s;ent over a detachment of &s;even thou&s;and men, commanded by the Ca&s;tellans of St. Omer, Arras, and Giles de Melun, who arrived &s;afely at London, after hav|ing de&s;troyed a fleet of pyrates that blocked up the river. Then John, de&s;pairing of &s;ucce&s;s in his attempt upon the capital, marched into Kent, with a view to

engage the Cinque ports in his intere&s;t, and oppo&s;e the landing of Lewis, for who&s;e de&s;cent great preparations were making in the ports of France.</P>

<P>The pope, being informed of Philip's intention, di&s;patched one Gualo as his legate to the French court, with a mandate, forbidding the French king or his &s;on to invade England, which was part of the patrimony of St. Peter. But this prohibition had no effect upon the French monarch, who pro|ceeded with the equipment of his armament, which being compleated, his &s;on Lewis embarked the troops, and &s;etting &s;ail with a fleet of &s;even hundred ve&s;&s;els, landed without oppo&s;ition at Sandwich; John retreating from Dover to Win|che&s;ter, after having left a &s;trong garri&s;on in the ca&s;tle, under the command of Hubert de Burgh, a brave and tru&s;ty adherent. In this retreat, he met the pope's legate ju&s;t arrived from France, who excommunicated Lewis by name, together with all his followers and ab$ttors; and this cen&s;ure was extended to the clergy of London, and particularly to Simon Langton, who had encouraged them to perform divine &s;ervice in their churches, notwith&s;tanding an excommunication and interdict i&s;&s;ued again&s;t the city by the pope, and publi&s;hed by the abbot of Abingdon. Lewis had endeavoured to pacify the legate, and avert tho&s;e cen|&s;ures, by trumping up a lame title to the throne, in right of his wife Blanche of Ca&s;tile, who was grand-daughter to Henry II. &s;upported by the con&s;ent and in|vitation of the people, groaning under the tyranny of a u&s;urper, and convicted homicide: but Gualo paying no regard to the&s;e repre&s;entations, he re&s;olved to $et the pope at defiance, and marched immediately again&s;t the ca&s;tle of Roche&s;|ter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann.

Though he was never crowned king of England, he exerci&s;ed the &s;overeign au|thority, under the title of Domini Regis Franciae Primogenitus, granting char|ters for lands and honours, and created Simon Langton his high chancellor.<NOTE PLACE="marg">T$$v$t Ry$$r.</NOTE> This prince &s;aw the number of his parti&s;ans daily increa&s;e, while tho&s;e of John dimini&s;hed in the &s;ame proportion; for all the Flemings and va&s;&s;als of the crown of France, in the king's pay, abandoned his &s;ervice, rather than fight again&s;t the &s;on and heir of their natural &s;overeign; &s;o that John was di&s;abled from keeping the field, and having garri$oned his ca&s;tles, retired towards Bri&s;tol and Glouce&s;ter. Lewis did not fail to take the advantage of his weakne&s;s; he detached William Fitzpiers, Robert Fitzwalter, and William de Huntingfield, into E&s;&s;ex and Su$$olk, great part of which they &s;ubdued, while he him&s;elf reduced all the ca&s;tles of Su&s;&s;ex, and then marched to Winche&s;ter, where he received the homage of Hugh de Nevil$e, who delivered up the ca&s;tle of Marlborough.

he &s;allied upon the French, whom he defeated in different encounters; nor could all the power of Lewis &s;ubdue this bold adventurer. John's affairs &s;eem|ing de&s;perate, he was de&s;erted by the earls of Warenne, Sali&s;bury, Arundel, Albemarle, and Oxford; and Lewis, elevated by his pro&s;perity, convoked a ge|neral council at London, to exact the oath of allegiance from all the prelates and nobility of England. Among others, Alexander, king of Scotland, was &s;um|moned to this a&s;&s;embly, and, according to the order he received, rai&s;ed a &s;trong body of forces, with which he reduced the city of Carli&s;le; from thence he marched to London, and did homage to Lewis, after that prince and the Eng|li&s;h barons had &s;worn that they would not make peace without his concur|rence. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat.

<P>About this period, however, John's affairs began to put on a more favourable a&s;pect. The northern barons in be&s;ieging Barnard ca&s;tle, had the misfortune to lo&s;e Eu&s;tace de Ve&s;ci, who was the &s;oul of their confederacy; and though William Mare&s;chal the younger, had prevailed upon the city of Wor|ce&s;ter to declare for Lewis, it was afterwards recovered to John by that nobleman's own father the earl of Pembroke, who, in conjunction with the earl of Che&s;ter, and Fulk de Breant, retrieved al&s;o and fortified the I&s;le of Ely. The Cinque|ports, having equipped a fleet for the king's &s;ervice, intercepted a great reinforce|ment de&s;tined for the French prince, and cut off the communication with Lon|don by &s;ea, while Hubert de Burgh, governor of Dover ca&s;tle, made continual excur&s;ions and ravaged the lands of the barons. Lewis, after the reduction of Winche&s;ter, inve&s;ted this fortre&s;s, which was &s;o gallantly defended by the vigi|lant $a&s;tellan, that he made very little progre&s;s in the &s;iege; he was repul&s;ed in &s;everal attacks with great &s;laughter, and &s;o continually harra&s;&s;ed by the &s;allies of the be&s;ieged, that he &s;wore, in a tran&s;port of rage, he would not quit the place, until he &s;hould have taken the ca&s;tle and &s;een the garri&s;on hanged. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat.

<P>While he &s;pent his time in this fruitle&s;s enterprize, and another army commanded by the barons was employed in reducing the country of the Ea&s;t-Angles, John carried on the war in the marches of South Wales, again&s;t Reginald de Braou&s;e and Llewellyn, who had declared for his enemies. Having taken their ca&s;tles, and a&s;&s;embled an army in the we&s;t, upon who&s;e fidelity he could depend, he marched into Norfolk, ravaged the lands belonging to his ad|ver&s;aries, and compelled Gilbert de Gand, whom Lewis had created earl of that county, to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Lincoln. By this time, Lewis had lo&s;t the af|fection of the principal noblemen who had hitherto &s;upported his cau&s;e: he not only excluded them from his councils, but be&s;towed all his favours upon fo|reigners, and the&s;e treated the Engli&s;h with the mo&s;t &s;upercilious contempt. This partiality and in&s;olence was &s;o much re&s;ented by the barons, that they began to repent of having invited a foreign prince into the kingdom. He was de&s;erted by the earl of Sali&s;bury, William Mare&s;chal$ Walter Beauchamp, and &s;everal other noblemen; and their defection alarmed him with &s;u&s;picions con|cerning the fidelity of tho&s;e that remained. Thus actuated by jealou&s;y and re|&s;entment, he is &s;aid to have formed a plan of vengeance, which was di&s;covered to them by the vi&s;count de Melun, one of his chief confidents. That nobleman, de|&s;pairing of his recovery from a very dangerous di&s;temper, by which he was &s;eized at London, expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of &s;eeing &s;ome of the barons that were left
<PB N="452" REF="4610">
in the capital, and told them, that he could not die in peace until he &s;hould di&s;|charge his con&s;cience, by di&s;covering an affair in which they were deeply in|terefted: then he gave them to under&s;tand, that Lewis had re&s;olved to puni&s;h all the Engli&s;h barons, who had fought in his cau&s;e, as traitors to their natural prince, on who&s;e fidelity he could have no dependance. The barons, &s;tartled at this information, which &s;eemed to tally with their own remarks, communicated the dying words of this Frenchman to their friends and confederates, that they might be upon their guard, and take the fir&s;t convenient opportunity to detach them&s;elves from &s;uch a perfidious and ungrateful chief; they began to think &s;e|ricu&s;ly of reconciling them&s;elves to their own &s;overeign, and upwards of forty had already given John a&s;&s;urances of returning to their obedience, when death prevented him from reaping the fruits of their good intention.</P>

<P>That unfortunate monarch, after having ravaged the lands of the revolted barons in Norfolk, retired to Lynne, which was the rendezvous of all his forces, and, a&s;&s;embling a numerous army, re&s;olved to penetrate into the heart of the kingdom, and hazard a deci&s;ive battle, hoping to be joined in his march by tho&s;e who were di&s;contented with Lewis. Thus determined, he departed from Lynne, which, for its fidelity, he had di&s;tingui&s;hed with many marks of his favour: his route lying over the wa&s;hes between Lincoln&s;hire and Norfolk, which are overflowed at high water, he judged his time &s;o impru|dently, that the tide ru&s;hed in upon him, and he lo&s;t the greate&s;t part of his forces, together with all his trea&s;ure, baggage, and regalia. He him&s;elf hardly e&s;caped with life, and arrived at the abbey of Swine&s;tead, where he was &s;o deeply affected with his irreparable lo&s;s, that his grief produced a violent fever.

With re&s;pect to his di&s;po&s;ition, it is &s;trongly deli|neated in the tran&s;actions of his reign.

<P>JOHN had bequeathed the crown to his elde&s;t &s;on Henry; but that prince being but ten years of age, the kingdom was left without a rul|er, in a &s;tate of anarchy and di&s;traction; and the royal family had very little to hope from the very &s;mall number of noblemen who adhered to the late king, and a m$rcenary army of foreigners, in who&s;e fidelity John him&s;elf had never ful$y confided. The nation was aver&s;e to the memory of that unhappy prince; the barons were &s;ti$l under tho&s;e arms, which they had a&s;&s;umed for his de&s;truc|tion; and the greate&s;t part of the kingdom had &s;ubmitted an$ taken the oath of a$legiance to Lewis of France. It was well for the Engli&s;h that this impoli|tic prince made &s;uch an unpopular u&s;e of his pro&s;perity. Had he behaved with a &s;hew of impartiality and moderation, the country would, in all probability, have been en&s;laved; but he had already forfeited the e&s;teem of the people, by his haughty deportment, contempt of their per&s;ons and manners, and unju&s;t partiality to his own countrymen, at who&s;e in&s;olence and extortion he connived. The commonalty inveighed in public again&s;t the in&s;olence of tho&s;e &s;trangers; and the mutual confidence which at fir&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between Lewis and the nobi|lity, was now qu$te de&s;troyed. The majority of the barons had re&s;olved to re|nounce the French intere&s;t, even before the king's decea&s;e; and that event de|prived them of all cau&s;e of oppo&s;ition. As &s;oon as that prince expired, the earl of Pembroke$ who was well acquainted with the &s;entiments of both parties, &s;ummoned the barons to Glouce&s;ter, and tho&s;e that adhered to John being a&s;&s;em|bled, he pre&s;ented young Henry, &s;aying, "Behold your king." He ob&s;erved, that whatever cau&s;e the late king might have given for oppo&s;ition to his will, the innocent &s;on ought not to be charged w$th the $$ults of his father; that it would be u$ju&s;t to wre&s;t the crown from a f$mi$y $$ich had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it &s;o long, in order to be&s;tow it upon a thankle&s;s fore$g$er$ who woul$ not fail to en&s;lave the kingdom; and that nothing would &s;$cure them $g$in&s;t this impend$ng &s;la|very, but an unre&s;$rved union among them&s;elves, und$r a prince po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an heredita$y tit$e. With regard to the invitation Lewis had received, he alledg$d that prince had u&s;ed it to &s;uch bad purpo&s;$s by his arbitrary mann$$ of pr$ceed|ing, that he ought to forfeit all the ben$fit of their fir&s;t agreement; and be de|&s;ired to quit the kingdom, which he &s;eem$d &s;o ill qualified to govern. This remon&s;trance was &s;o well received by the a&s;&s;$mbly, that they unanimo$&s;ly ex|claimed, "Let Henry be king, let Henry be king." In con&s;equence of this declaration, he was cro$ned in the cathedral on the Eve of St. Simon and St.

The young king took the cu&s;to|mary oath at his coronation, and the legate in&s;i&s;ted upon his doing homage to the holy &s;ee; a demand which the few nobles there a&s;&s;embled did not think pro|per to refu&s;e: then the barons &s;wore fealty to his maje&s;ty, and his per&s;on was committed to the charge of the earl of Pembroke, who acted as regent of the kingdom.</P>

<P>This office could not have been conferred upon a nobleman of greater<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1216.</NOTE> honour and capacity. He had pre&s;erved his attachment to John, with the mo&s;t inviolable fidelity, even in the mid&s;t of all his misfortunes. He was perfectly well acquainted with the cau&s;e of the late troubles, as well as with the intere&s;ts and intrigues of tho&s;e by whom they had been excited. He knew how ill af|fected the barons were to the prince whom they had invited to the kingdom; was privy to the &s;ecret negotiation between the late king and the forty barons, who had promi&s;ed to renounce the party of Lewis; and he did not doubt but that the confederacy would di&s;&s;olve, as &s;oon as they &s;hould think them&s;elves &s;ecure from the penalties of rebellion. In this hope he, by circular letters, noti|fied young Henry's coronation to all the barons and communities of the king|dom; and promi&s;ed a general amne&s;ty to all tho&s;e who &s;hould return to their obedience. This a&s;&s;urance, and the known probity of the regent, made &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions upon many barons of the a&s;&s;ociation: and this was reinforced by the &s;entence of excommunication again&s;t Lewis, which the legate repeated every Sunday, and in which they them&s;elves were included; for however they might have &s;et tho&s;e cen&s;ures of excommunication at defiance, when their pa&s;|&s;ions were inflamed with the fir&s;t glowings of hope and re&s;entment, and their op|po&s;ition was encouraged by the vigorous union and &s;pirited mea&s;ures of a &s;trong confederacy, the&s;e impul$es and concurring motives were now con&s;iderably weakened, and the tender con&s;ciences of &s;ome among them began to feel the pangs of remor&s;e and the horrors of eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ure.</P>

<P>Lewis had long ago lo&s;t the affection of the barons, and now he became the object of their contempt. He had frequently attempted to corrupt the integrity of Hubert de Burgh, governor of Dover ca&s;tle, but &s;till found his honour and courage equally invincible. He was employed in the &s;iege of this fortre&s;s, at the death of John, which he thought would produce a change in Hubert's con|duct: he &s;ummoned him once more to &s;urrender, and repre&s;ented, in a parley, that as he was now di&s;engaged from the oath of allegiance he had taken, he ought to make no &s;cruple in acknowledging a prince whom his countrymen had received as their &s;overeign, and who would take plea&s;ure in giving him particular marks of his favour. The hone&s;t governor an&s;wered, that the late king had left a &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or, whom it was his duty to obey; that he would &s;erve the young prince to the la&s;t drop of his blood; and, with regard to the promi&s;es of Lewis, he &s;aid the e&s;teem of a magnanimous prince could never be purcha&s;ed by &s;uch infamous treachery. Lewis, finding him incorruptible, changed his battery, and threatened to take away the life of his brother, who was in his power. Hubert preferred his duty to his brother, and continued impregnable; &s;o that the be&s;ieger was obliged to abandon his enterprize. He <NOTE PLACE="marg">M. Pari$$</NOTE>
<PB N="458" REF="4670">
repaired to London, extremely chagrined at his mi&s;carriage, and having taken mea&s;ures for &s;ecuring his intere&s;t in that capital, marched again&s;t the ca&s;tle of Hert$$rd, which &s;urrendered, after a faint re&s;i&s;tance. The cu&s;tody of this for|tre&s;s belonged by hereditary right to Robert Fitz-walter, who demanded it ac|cordingly, and not only &s;uffered a repul&s;e, but had the mortification to &s;ee the government conferred on a Frenchman, and the ca&s;tle garri&s;oned with fo|reigners. This in&s;ulting act of inju&s;tice produced a great clamour among the Engli&s;h$ they were &s;tripped of their inheritances by aliens, and even re|viled as traitors, who could not be entru&s;ted with any place of importance: they now believed in good earne&s;t the truth of what the count de Melun had di&s;|covered on his death-bed, and looked upon them&s;elves as victims devoted to de&s;truction. Thus a general di&s;content prevailed among the Engli&s;h, who re&s;olved to make him feel the effects of their re&s;entment; mean while he pro|ceded in his conque&s;ts, and about the end of the year returned to London.</P>

<P>The regent on his &s;ide neglected nothing which could contribute to|wards the maintenance of his pupil's preten&s;ions. He notified his coronation to the pope, and &s;ollicited the protection of his holine&s;s, in favour of the young prince, &s;urrounded by foreign and dome&s;tic enemies; and Innocent, who was never wanting to his own intere&s;t, exerted him&s;elf for the pre&s;ervation of Eng|land, as the patrimony of St. Peter. He &s;ent new powers to the legate, to aggravate the excommunication of Lewis and his adherents; and that prince, being made acquainted with the mandate, prote&s;ted &s;olemnly again&s;t every<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. Pub.</NOTE> &s;tep which &s;hould be taken to his prejudice. In the mean time he appointed a day for receiving anew the homage of the Engli&s;h barons: but, notwith|&s;tanding this precaution, the legate a&s;&s;embled a &s;ynod at Bri&s;tol, where he re|peated the &s;entence of excommunication again&s;t Lewis; and &s;everal barons made this cen&s;ure a pretext for refu&s;ing the homage that was required. Lewis was now glad to accept the propo&s;al of a &s;hort truce, during which he held a general a&s;&s;embly at Oxford. The regent convoked another at Cambridge, and demanded a prolongation of the truce, which the prince of France at fir&s;t refu&s;ed, till hearing the pope intended to excommunicate him in full con&s;i&s;tory, he con&s;ented to a further &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of ho&s;tilities, that he might make a &s;hort tour to Paris, and con&s;ult the king his father. The earl of Pem|broke did not fail to &s;eize this opportunity of &s;trengthening his army with new levies, and making pro&s;elytes to the king's intere&s;t. Among others gained over on this occa&s;ion, was his own &s;on William Mare&s;chal, who had been a zealous parti&s;an of the barons; and the Cinque-Ports not only declared for Henry, but equipped a fleet, with which they attacked Lewis in his return, and de&s;troyed &s;ome of his ve&s;&s;els; an in&s;ult which provoked him to &s;uch a degree,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>At the expiration of the truce, the regent &s;ent the earl of Che&s;ter to be&s;iege Mont&s;orrel, in the county of Leice&s;ter, defended by a French garri&s;on; and Lewis detached the count de Perche, at the head of twenty thou&s;and men, to give him battle. The earl of Che&s;ter, being greatly inferior in point of number, abandoned the enterprize, and retired at his approach; and the French general advancing to Lincoln, inve&s;ted the ca&s;tle, which was held for the king, though the town declared for the barons. The regent re&s;olved to &s;uccour this important place, though at the expence of an engagement; he a&s;&s;embled his

forces with equal diligence and &s;ecrecy, and had marched as far as Newark, within twelve miles of Lincoln, before the count de Perche had the lea&s;t inti|mation of his approach. That general immediately held a council of war, in which &s;ome of the mo&s;t experienced officers advi&s;ed him to quit the town, and give the earl of Pembroke battle in the open plain, where he could u&s;e his ca|valry, which otherwi&s;e would be u&s;ele&s;s; but the majority were of opinion that having reduced the ca&s;tle to extremity, they ought not to give up that advan|tage, but continue the &s;iege and remain in the town, which was in no danger of being forced by the regent. In con&s;equence of this determination, they forti|fied the walls &s;o as to render the place defen&s;ible; and the regent, approaching without oppo&s;ition, threw into the ca&s;tle, by a po&s;tern, a choice body of troops, commanded by Fulk de Breant, who, according to the in&s;tructions he had re|ceived, made a furious &s;ally upon the be&s;iegers, while the earl of Pembroke a&s;&s;aulted one of the city gates. This double attack &s;oon produced confu&s;ion among the French forces, which were hampered for want of room, and &s;aw them&s;elves charged on all &s;ides with the mo&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;tic fury. The count de Perche having made &s;urpri&s;ing efforts to rally his troops and &s;u&s;tain the impetuo|&s;ity of the Engli&s;h, &s;aw him&s;elf at la&s;t entirely defeated; and di&s;daining to &s;urvive the di&s;grace, ru&s;hed upon the &s;words of the enemy. The earls of Winche&s;ter and Hereford, Gilbert de Ghent, and Robert Fitz-walter, with four hundred knights and a great number of e&s;quires and common &s;oldiers, were taken pri&s;oners; but no quarter was given to the French, who were all cut in pieces. The town, which from the beginning of the troubles had e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of the barons, was abandoned to pillage, and the &s;oldiers gained ine&s;timable booty; &s;o that they di&s;|tingui&s;hed<NOTE PLACE="marg">M.

As for all the prie&s;ts and per&s;ons belonging to the church, that were found in the place, they were treated as excommunicated wretches, by the expre&s;s de&s;ire of the legate, who had con|fe&s;&s;ed and given ab&s;olution to all the chiefs of the king's party, with full a&s;&s;u|rance of paradi&s;e to every man who &s;hould fall in battle again&s;t the enemies of the church; &s;o that even the common &s;oldiers fought with &s;urpri&s;ing ala|crity and re&s;olution.</P>

<P>Lewis had recommenced the &s;iege of Dover, in which he was em|ployed when he received the unwelcome tidings of this di&s;a&s;ter: he forthwith abandoned his enterprize, and returned to London, in order to take &s;ome imme|diate mea&s;ures for repairing the damage he had &s;u&s;tained. He di&s;patched let|ters to his father, &s;olliciting a &s;peedy r$in&s;orcement, without which he &s;aid he &s;hould not be able to re-e&s;tabli&s;h his affairs. Philip, loth to embroil him&s;elf fur|ther with the pope, affected to di&s;claim his proceedings, and declared in public that Lewis mu&s;t extricate him&s;elf as well as he could from the difficulties in which he was involved; but, at the &s;ame time, he enabled Blanche, his daughter-in|law, to equip an armament, in her own name, for the relief of her hu&s;band; and a &s;trong body of forces embarked at Calais for England. The commanders of the fleet fitted out by the Cinque-Ports, in the king's &s;ervice, being informed of th$&s;e preparations, waited for the French tran&s;ports in the channel, and attacking them in the pa&s;&s;age, took or &s;unk the greate&s;t part of the armament. This misfortune was the more &s;en&s;ibly felt by Lewis, as the Engli&s;h army ap|proached London, in which he immediately found him&s;elf blocked up by the regent, without any hope of relief: the people now expre&s;&s;ed their di&s;$$ntent

without re&s;erve; the chief barons of his alliance were taken pri&s;oners at Lin|coin; the re&s;t had either abandoned his party or were &s;u&s;pected of di&s;a$iection; the $word$ thunder began to sound terrible in his ears; his enemies were ma&s;t|ers of the sea; and he him&s;elf was be&s;ieged in a foreign country, cut off from all &s;ources of s$ccour and &s;upply. In this forlorn &s;ituation, he demanded an hono$rable peace of the regent, which &s;hould comprehend his allies, by whom he had been invited to England; otherwi&s;e he would li&s;ten to no terms of ac|commodation. The earl of Pembroke granted his reque&s;t, without he&s;itation, being equally unwilling to incur the re&s;entment of Philip, who would have doubtless exerted the whole power of France to &s;ave his &s;on from de&s;truction; and to drive the barons to de&s;pair, by which the nation might be involved in new troubles. Conferences were immediately begun, and in a little time a treaty of peace was concluded, on condition that all the adherents of Lewis &s;hould be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in the rights and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions they enjoyed before the troubles; that the antient pr$vileges of the city of London &s;hould be pre&s;erved; that all the pri&s;oners taken &s;ince the arrival of Lewis &s;hould be relea&s;ed, and com|mi&s;&s;aries apointed to regulate the terms upon which the re&s;t &s;hould be ran|&s;omed or exchanged; that all the Engli&s;h, without di&s;tinction, who had re|volted again&s;t John, &s;hould take the oath of allegiance to Henry; that the ho&s;tages delivered to Lewis for the ran&s;om of pri&s;oners, &s;hould be &s;et at li|berty, upon payment of the money; that all the places, towns, and ca&s;tles, occupied by Lewis in England, &s;hould be &s;urrendered to king Henry; that the king of Scotland might be comprehended in this treaty, on re&s;toring all that he had &s;eized during the war; and that the &s;ame re&s;titution &s;hould be made to him by the Engli&s;h monarch; that the prince of Wales &s;hould enjoy the benefit of the &s;ame &s;tipulation; that Lewis &s;hould relinqui&s;h all the i&s;les, which were occupied in his name; and renounce the homage which had been payed to him by the &s;ubjects of England. Be&s;ides the&s;e public articles, Lewis promi&s;ed to employ all his influence with his father, that the foreign<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. Pub. Mezera$. M.

<P>The treaty being &s;igned, ratified and confirmed by the pope's legate, Lewis received ab&s;olution, and &s;et &s;ail for France, after having borrowed five thou&s;and marks of the city of London for the payment of his debts; and he was no &s;ooner embarked than Henry made his public entrance into London, where he was received with great pomp and univer&s;al &s;atisfaction. Then he swore to maintain the nation in all its privileges; and in this voluntary oath the barons obtained more &s;olid advantages than ever they could have ex|pected from the victories of a foreign prince, by which in all appearance they would have effectually been en&s;laved. Of all the adherents of Lewis, the cler|gy were the only per&s;ons who &s;uffered by this pacification. Nothing had been &s;tipulated in their favour, except a re&s;titution of the lay-fees which they po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed; &s;o that they were left expo&s;ed to all the terrors of eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ure. The pope had been very much mortified to find his &s;entences de&s;pi&s;ed by the laity; but he was implacably incen&s;ed again&s;t the churchmen who had re|belled again&s;t his authority. The legate therefore, being now at liberty to act again&s;t tho&s;e rebellious eccle&s;ia&s;tics, &s;et on foot a &s;evere inquiry all over
<PB N="461" REF="4700">
the kingdom, by which he learned the names of tho&s;e who had di&s;obeyed the interbict; and they being convicted of this unpardonable crime again&s;t the ma|je&s;ty of the pope, were &s;u&s;pended, deprived, or obliged to attone their guilt with great &s;ums of money. The king of Scotland, who had been excommuni|cated for doing homage to Lewis, claimed the benefit of the treaty; and re|pairing to Northampton, received ab&s;olution of the legate, after having &s;worn fealty to king Henry for the fiefs he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in England.</P>

<P>It was not without great difficulty that the regent executed the treaty which had been made with Lewis. The barons who had &s;erved the late king could not, without great reluctance, part with the lands of the revolt|ers, which had been granted to them by John as a recompence for their attach|ment; and the clergy complained loudly of having been abandoned to the per|&s;ecutions of the Roman &s;ee. Neverthele&s;s, the earl of Pembroke, &s;eeing no other po&s;&s;ibil$$y of re&s;toring the peace of the kingdom, than that of punctually executing the articles of convention, in&s;i&s;ted upon the immediate re&s;titution of the alienated lands, and even compelled Robert Gawgy by force of arms to re&s;tore the ca&s;tle of Nottingham to the bi&s;hop of Lincoln its former owner. The re&s;t, &s;ubmitted without compul&s;ion; and as for the clergy, he could not in|termeddle<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1218.</NOTE> in their affairs, without embroiling him&s;elf with the pope, who&s;e pro|tection was very nece&s;&s;ary to the intere&s;ts of Henry. Far from oppo&s;ing his mea&s;ures, he, at the de&s;ire of the legate, publi&s;hed a proclamation, enjoining all excommunicated eccle&s;ia&s;tics who had not received ab&s;olution to quit the king|dom, on pain of impri&s;onment; &s;o that they were obliged to compound with the legate for the removal of his cen&s;ures. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Id. Brady.</NOTE></P>
<P>All the troubles of the nation being now happily appea&s;ed, the regent &s;ent or|ders to all the magi&s;trates of the kingdom, to execute the two charters of king John, and puni&s;h all tho&s;e who &s;hould refu&s;e to conform to the articles contained in the&s;e con&s;titutions. The earl of Pembroke acted, in all re&s;pects, like a great and good man, warmly attached to the intere&s;t of his country: in order to &s;pare the &s;ubjects the expence of men and money, for the reduction of Llewellyn, prince of Wales, who had acted as an auxiliary of the barons, he propo&s;ed honourable terms of accommodation, which were embraced by that prince, who was after|wards ab&s;olved by the legate, through the earl's interce&s;&s;ion. This was the la&s;t<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>In a little time after Gualo's departure, the nation &s;u&s;tained an irre|parable<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

As the king's coronation at Winche&s;ter had been performed in a defective and informal manner, it was thought proper to repeat the ceremony, in which cardinal Langton officiated, that prelate having, by this time, been freed from the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, in con&s;equence of which he had quitted the kingdom. Immediately after the coronation, Hen|ry, with his new regent, made a progre&s;s through the different counties of the kingdom, in order to enquire into the management of the &s;ervants belonging to the crown, and remove &s;uch governors as were thought aver&s;e to the pre|&s;ent admini&s;tration. None of the&s;e made any oppo&s;ition to the king's will,
<PB N="462" REF="4710">
except William de Albemarle, ca&s;tellan of Rockingham, who had erected him&s;elf into a &s;overeign, and affected to de&s;pi&s;e the orders of the government.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

After this expedition, the king returned to Lon|don, where, with his own hand, he laid the fir&s;t &s;tone of the new abbey church of We&s;tmin&s;ter, which remains to this day. In the cour&s;e of this year, the pope canonized Hugh, bi&s;hop of Lincoln, who died in the beginning of John's reign, and was &s;aid to have performed miracles; and Stephen Langton, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, in&s;pired with the mo&s;t profound veneration for his pr$dece&s;&s;or Thomas Becket, who&s;e genius was congenial with his own, ordered the body of that apo&s;tle to be removed from the &s;tone-coffin and vault, in which it was fir&s;t interred, to a rich &s;hrine of gold, be&s;et with precious &s;tones. This ceremony was performed in pre&s;ence of the king, and Pandulf, the pope's legate, with almo&s;t all the prelates and nobility of England, &s;urrounded by an incredible multitude of people, a great number of whom arrived from<NOTE PLACE="marg">M.

<P>Mean while William de Albemarle, thinking him&s;elf injured in the affair of Rockingham, in&s;tead of obeying the king's order, when &s;ummoned to a general council at We&s;tmin&s;ter a&s;&s;embled on national affairs, rai&s;ed a body of troops, with which he &s;urpri&s;ed the ca&s;tle of Fotheringay in Nor|thampton&s;hire. Leaving a &s;trong garri&s;on in the place, he returned to his own habitation at Biham, which he fortified again&s;t all oppo&s;ition, obliging all mer|chants and travellers that pa&s;&s;ed through the neighbourhood, to pay for his pa&s;&s;ports, on pain of being plundered by his detachments. The great coun|cil, informed of the&s;e violent and illegal proceedings, &s;ummoned him to ap|pear and ju&s;tify his conduct; and he refu&s;ing to obey, a&s;&s;embled an army to be&s;iege the ca&s;tle, re&s;olving to puni&s;h him with all the &s;everity of the law. William, under&s;tanding that the troops were in march again him, retired to the northern parts of the kingdom, leaving the command of Biham to a go|vernor, who did not &s;urrender until he was reduced to the utmo&s;t extremity: he him&s;elf afterwards found means to make his peace with the regent, who, at the interce&s;&s;ion of the archbi&s;hop of York, forgave his revolt, in con&s;idera|tion of his &s;ervices to the late king. This di&s;turbance being quelled, the king m$rched again&s;t Llewellyn, prince of Wales, who had inve&s;ted the ca&s;tle of Buelt, belonging to Reginald de Braou&s;e; but he relinqui&s;hed his enterprize, and r$$ir$$ at the approa$h of Henry, who pur&s;ued him to Montgomery, where a c$$$le was built to prevent future incur&s;ions. It was after his return from this expedition, that the king's &s;i&s;ter Joane, who had been betrothed to the &s;on of earl Marche, was removed from the cu&s;tody of that nobleman, and married $t York to Alexander, king of Scotland. That prince's &s;i&s;ter, about the<NOTE PLACE="marg">C$r. $word$.</NOTE> &s;$me time, e&s;pou&s;ed Hubert de Burgh, ju&s;ticiary of England; a match by which he incurred the envy and jealou&s;y of &s;ome noblemen, who took all op|portunities to di&s;turb him in the execution of his office.

<P>The tranquillity of the nation was not yet &s;o firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, but that &s;ome turbulent individuals took all occa&s;ions to excite civil broils and com|motions; nor was the party of Lewis as yet quite extingui&s;hed in the realm, as appeared about this period in a riot at We&s;tmin&s;ter. The citizens of Lon|don having obtained the prize in a wre&s;tling-match, appointed by the &s;tew|ard belonging to the abbot of We&s;tmin&s;ter, this man repined at the glory which had been won from his tenants, and re&s;olved to revenge the di&s;grace. With this view, he propo&s;ed a &s;econd contention, and a ram as the prize of the victors; the Londoners flocked in great numbers to this diver&s;ion, and were &s;uddenly attacked by the &s;teward, and a band of armed ru&s;tics, whom he had a&s;&s;embled for the purpo&s;e. The citizens, being repul&s;ed with great indignity, and a good number of them wounded in the fray, re&s;olved to take immediate vengeance upon the perfidious &s;teward, and took to their arms in a very tumultuous manner: Serle the mayor endeavoured to quell the com|motion, and advi&s;ed them to complain to the abbot, from whom they would receive proper &s;atisfaction; but this expedient was oppo&s;ed by Con&s;tantine Fitz-Arnulf, a rich, turbulent, and popular citizen, who had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf as a parti&s;an of Lewis and the barons. As he loved to fi&s;h in troubled waters, was ambitious of commanding the multitude, and believed that this di&s;turbance might produce &s;omething that would revive the civil di&s;&s;en&s;ions of the nation, he harrangued the rioters, and having inflamed their pa&s;&s;ions, propo&s;ed that they &s;hould march again&s;t the abbot and his &s;teward, and raze their hou&s;es to the ground. The &s;cheme being applauded, he put him&s;elf at their head, and proceeded to We&s;tmin&s;ter, exclaiming Mon joye St. Denis! which was the war word of the French; and having demoli&s;hed &s;everal hou&s;es belonging to the abbey, returned to the city in triumph. Hubert de Burgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1222.</NOTE> the ju&s;ticiary, being informed of this outrage, aggravated by the traiterous ex|pre&s;&s;ions of Con&s;tantine and the populace, repaired directly to the Tower with a body of troops, and &s;ummoned the citizens to appear and an&s;wer for tho&s;e riotous proceedings: Con&s;tantine going thither with great confidence, boldly ju&s;tified what he had done; declared he would repeat the &s;ame conduct on the like occa&s;ion; and pleaded the indemnity which had been &s;tipulated for the parti&s;ans of Lewis, by the treaty of pacification. Hubert gave him to under|&s;tand, that nothing was &s;tipulated in favour of tho&s;e who &s;hould commit acts of &s;edition; and that he, with his two chief accomplices, &s;hould be hanged next morning. This &s;entence was accordingly executed, notwith&s;tanding his offer to redeem his life with fifteen thou&s;and marks of &s;ilver; and many citizens, concerned in the tum$lt, were puni&s;hed with the amputation of their hands and feet: nay, the king further expre&s;&s;ed his re&s;entment again&s;t the city, by turning the magi&s;trates out of their offices, and appointing others by his &s;ole authority.</P>

<P>This exerci&s;e of &s;everity rai&s;ed an univer&s;al clamour among the peo|ple; e&s;pecially as it was practi&s;ed in direct oppo&s;ition to the charters which had been &s;o lately confirmed; for the puni&s;hments were inflicted by the arbitrary &s;entence of Hubert, without any previous trial or legal conviction. Lewis affected to complain of it as an in&s;ringement of the peace, in&s;omuch that,
<PB N="464" REF="4730">
when he a&s;cended the throne of France, he made this tran&s;action a pretence<NOTE PLACE="marg">M$ P$$$ R$$. W$$ $word$ $word$</NOTE> for refu&s;ing to re&s;tore Normandy and the other foreign dominions to Henry, ac$ording to his pr$m$&s;e. So ab&s;olute was the royal power, at this period, that the king exacted ho&s;tages for the peaceable behaviour of the citizens; and thirty of the principal inhabitants being nominated for this purpo&s;e, the corpo|ration obliged them&s;elves, by an authentic deed, to deliver them up whenever they &s;hould be demanded. This exertion of de&s;potic power, however, gave &s;uch umbrage to the nation in general, that, in a &s;ub&s;equent a&s;&s;embly held at Oxford, the members in&s;i&s;ted upon the king's executing the charters, to the ob&s;ervance of which he had &s;olemnly &s;worn. The court had, &s;ince the death of William, earl of Pembroke, adopted new maxims; and when this addre&s;s was pre&s;ented to the king, William Bruvere, one of his courtiers, &s;aid it was unr$a&s;onable to demand the performance of charters, which had been extorted by force. The archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, &s;tartled at this ra&s;h declaration, replied, that if he really loved the king, who&s;e intere&s;ts he pretended &s;o warmly to $&s;pou&s;e, he would not &s;eek to reinvolve the kingdom in fre&s;h troubles; and Henry him&s;elf, being then in the &s;ixteenth year of his age, &s;econded Langton, and a&s;&s;ured the deputies of his firm intention to ob&s;erve the charters with the utmo&s;t punctuality. He accordingly i&s;&s;ued orders all over the kingdom, for the exact execution of all the articles; and the a&s;&s;embly was &s;o well plea&s;ed with his behaviour on this occa&s;ion, that they indulged him with a very con|&s;iderable<NOTE PLACE="marg">M P$$$$.</NOTE> &s;ub&s;idy, that he might be enabled to relieve the chri&s;tians in the Holy Land.</P>

In this manner did the arbitrary di&s;po|&s;ition of the ju&s;ticiary injure his ma&s;ter, abroad as well as at home, where he a&s;&s;umed a prerogative, to which none of his predece&s;&s;ors in that employment had ever a&s;pired: nor was he contented with the great &s;hare of power and au|thority which he engro&s;&s;ed, as being &s;till obliged to receive orders from the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, who had been declared regent of the kingdom, during the minority of Henry. Hubert, in order to abridge the term of this pre|late's office, obtained a bull from the pope, declaring the king of age, au|thorizing him to take the reins of government in his own hands, and enjoin|ing all tho&s;e who fil$$d offices to re&s;ign them to their &s;overeign, that he might di&s;po&s;e of them as he &s;hould think proper. This mandate the barons ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to obey, becau&s;e it was directly contrary to the laws of the kingdom, which limited the king's minority to the age of one and twenty.</P>

Such a mean collu&s;ion, not only provoked them again&s;t Henry, but al&s;o impre&s;&s;ed them with an unfavourable opinion of his morals. They con&s;idered his favourite as the author of this unworthy contrivance: tho&s;e who enjoyed offices at court, unable to bear the in&s;olence of the ju&s;ticiary, re&s;igned their places, and retired to their re&s;pective homes, re&s;olving to embrace the fir&s;t opportunity of ex|pre&s;&s;ing their re&s;entment in a more effectual manner. Such barons as had not fallen into the &s;nare, Hubert endeavoured to intimidate, by threatening them with the &s;entence of excommunication; and &s;ome of them were thus ter|rified into compliance; but others de&s;pi&s;ed the&s;e menaces, and re&s;olved to maintain their rights and property, again&s;t all the efforts of the king and his<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abb. de Cogg$ M.

The principal malecontents were the earls of Che&s;ter and Albe|marle, Fulk de Bryant, and Robert de Vipont; the&s;e, with &s;ome other barons, held a council at Leice&s;ter, in order to concert mea&s;ures for their mutual defence, and refu&s;ed to appear at a general a&s;&s;embly convened at Nor|thampton, where the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury and his &s;uffragans fulminated a &s;entence of excommunication again&s;t all di&s;turbers of the public peace; and threatened them, in particular, with that &s;entence from the pope, unle&s;s they would immediately re&s;ign the ca&s;tles belonging to the crown, which were in their cu&s;tody. The cen&s;ures of the church were &s;o formidable, that, rather than incur them, the&s;e noblemen &s;ubmitted, and gave up the fortre&s;&s;es, though they did not lay a&s;ide their enmity to the ju&s;ticiary, nor the de&s;ire of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>Lewis was well informed of the&s;e inte&s;tine commotions, which &s;eemed to be the prelude of a new rebellion, that might turn out to his advantage: mean while, in&s;tead of fulfilling the articles of the peace, which he had &s;worn to ob&s;erve, he confi&s;cated all the lands belonging to Engli&s;h noblemen in his dominions, and marched into Saintonge, where he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of divers places: then he inve&s;ted Rochelle, which was immediately &s;urrendered by Savary Maulion, who embraced the intere&s;t of France, out of re&s;entment to the Engli&s;h government, which, when he demanded a &s;upply in money, &s;ent him a che&s;t full of old iron. This unprovoked inva&s;ion, which Lewis cloaked with the frivolous pretence of Henry's having omitted to appear at his con&s;ecration, plainly demon&s;trated the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ending an army abroad; and a general a&s;&s;embly was convoked at Northampton, to con&s;ider upon ways and means to equip an armament equal to an $nterprize of &s;uch importance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Paul.

The a&s;&s;embly promi&s;ed to grant this &s;ub&s;idy, provided the king would order the charters of John to be more punctually ob&s;erved; and he forthwith appointed commi&s;&s;aries to vi&s;it the different counties, and &s;ee the articles duly executed: a conce&s;&s;ion which operated &s;o favourably on the minds of the people, that the tax was paid with great chearfulne&s;s; and the bi&s;hops excommunicated all tho&s;e who &s;hould commit any frauds in the collection.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann.

Thus &s;upplied, the king levied an army, and equipped a fleet for an expedition into Guienne, under the command of his brother Richard, whom he had knighted and created earl of Cornwal. That young prince, accom|panied by the earl of Sali&s;bury and Philip d'Albiney, &s;et &s;ail from England with a fleet of three hundred &s;hips; and landing at Bourdeaux, was joined by a great number of adventurers whom he took into his &s;ervice. Thus reinforced, he marched into Guienne, where he reduced &s;everal places, and, at la&s;t, in|ve&s;ted the ca&s;tle of La Reole, which being &s;trongly fortified, held out until the count de la Marche, general of the French army, advanced to its relief. Richard, being too weak to hazard a battle, abandoned the &s;iege, and retreated to the other &s;ide of the river Dourdogne; and while he remained on the con|tinent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$egord.</NOTE> he attempted nothing further of any importance.</P>

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions in Guienne, Otho arrived as pope's legate; and an a&s;&s;embly being convoked at his de&s;ire, while the king lay dan|gerou&s;ly ill at Marlborough, he made a very extraordinary propo&s;al, in the name of his holine&s;s. He began his harrangue, by ob&s;erving that the holy &s;ee had long lain under the reproach of &s;elling her favours for money; and that it
<PB N="467" REF="4760">
was the duty of all good chri&s;tians to remove the cau&s;e of that imputation, which was no other than the extreme indigence of the Roman church. He therefore propo&s;ed, that in order to relieve the pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ities of the holy &s;ee, and enable it to di&s;tribute its indulgences with genero&s;ity and mode|ration, two prebends in every cathedral, and as many cells in every convent of England, &s;hould be granted to the pope, by an authentic deed, confirmed by an act of the general a&s;&s;embly. This demand was &s;o uncon&s;cionable, that the council, far from complying with it, would not even deign to an&s;wer the legate, until he complained of being treated with di&s;re&s;pect; then they told him, that the ab&s;ence of the king and &s;ome principal members, would not permit them to deliberate upon a propo&s;al of that nature. Otho, with a per&s;everance which<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1226.</NOTE> was truly pontifical, de&s;ired them to continue the &s;e&s;&s;ion, until his maje&s;ty and the ab&s;ent members &s;hould arrive; but they paid no regard to his intreaties, and broke up without even conferring upon the &s;ubject: &s;o that he found him|&s;elf obliged to exert his patience till another opportunity. During this inter|val, he made a progre&s;s into the north, where, under pretence of the right of procurations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was a right, which legates had to free entertainment, while they vi&s;ited churches and mona&s;teries; which entertainment they now commuted for money.</NOTE>, he fleeced and harra&s;&s;ed the churches in &s;uch a manner, that the clergy complained of him to the pope, who recalled him immediately, rather than run the ri&s;que of exa&s;perating the Engli&s;h at &s;uch a conjuncture. At the &s;ame time, he directed the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury to procure ano|ther convocation of the a&s;&s;embly, and demand a po&s;itive an&s;wer to the pro|po&s;ition which had been made by the legate. His mandate was obeyed by Langton; and the king, with the advice of his prelates, declared to his holi|ne&s;s, that, as the affair concerned all Chri&s;tendom as well as England, he would<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. Paris.</NOTE> conform to the re&s;olutions of his neighbour potentates. Mean while, Hen|ry continued his preparations again&s;t France, until he was obliged to interrupt them on account of the cru&s;ade again&s;t the Albegen&s;es, which Lewis undertook to command in per&s;on, while the pope expre&s;ly forbade all chri&s;tian princes to invade his dominions, to the prejudice of this expedition. Henry, by the ad|vice of his council, re&s;olved therefore to po&s;tpone all ho&s;tilities until the return of the French king, who was, by this time, employed in the &s;iege of Avignon; after the reduction of which he died, not without &s;u&s;picion of being poi&s;oned by the count de Champagne, who loved his queen to di&s;traction. Lewis IX. &s;ucceeded his father, under the tuition of Blanche of Ca&s;tile, who, though a foreigner, had intere&s;t enough to be declared regent of the kingdom.</P>

<P>In the mean time, Henry of England having been de|clared of age, before the time fixed by the laws of the realm, he began his reign with a &s;ample of government which impre&s;&s;ed the people with a very unfavourable opinion of his character. As he could not demand money from the a&s;&s;embly, after the large &s;ub&s;idies he had &s;o lately received, he re&s;olved to revive an expedient which had been practi&s;ed by his uncle Richard, after his return from Pale&s;tine. This was an order commanding all per&s;ons who enjoyed charters to pay a certain tax for their being renewed and confirmed; a griev|ance of which the mona&s;teries, and the nation in general, loudly complained: not that the king him&s;elf was &s;o much blamed for this extortion, as the ju&s;ti|ciary,
<PB N="468" REF="4770">
who had gained an ab&s;olute a&s;cendency over him, and attracted the $word$ of the people, which was not dimini&s;hed by the death of the earl of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch$ 122$.</NOTE> $word$ nat$ral &s;on of Henry II. This nobleman had performed many &s;ervices of the utmo&s;t importance to the late king, and was con&s;idered as a rival in power, or rather as a popular check upon the behaviour of Hubert, who invited him to an entertainment in his hou&s;e, immediately after which he was &s;eized with a langui&s;hing di&s;temper that conveyed him to his grave; &s;o that the people &s;u&s;pected he had not met with fair play from his entertainer. As Henry advanced in years he di&s;covered extreme avarice, incon&s;tancy, ca|price, w$akne&s;s of j$dgment, and irre$o$ution, mingl$d with the principles of $$ranny and oppre$$$on; which afford$d a v$ry di$agreeable pro&s;pect to his &s;ub|j$c$$. S$$h a $rince never gover$s in his own per&s;on: as he has neither maxims, $nowl$ge, nor re&s;olution, by $hich he can manage the helm of admini&s;tra|t$on, he nece&s;$$r$$y b$$omes a prey to &s;$me in&s;inuating, ambitious individual, who r$les him and the r$alm as f$vourite and prime mini&s;ter. Henry was a $$$ve of this $ort to H$bert de Burgh, who being impatient of any controul or partition of induence, pr$vailed upon the king to di&s;mi&s;s the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter from his councils; and that prelate was ordered to return to his d$oce&s;e. After his departure, the ju&s;ticiary per&s;uaded H$nry to render him|&s;$lf independent of tho&s;e re&s;trictions that hampered him in his admini&s;tration, and reign with ab&s;ol$te authority. He found the king very wel$ di&s;po&s;ed to follow his advice; the effects of which were &s;oon felt by the people of England. He exacted five thou&s;and marks from the city of London, on pretence of that community's having lent the like &s;um to Lewis when he departed from the kingdom. Northampton was compelled to pay twelve hundred pounds &s;terling, on &s;ome other frivolous pretext; and large &s;ums of money were &s;queezed from the mona&s;teries, notwith&s;tanding their appeals to his holine&s;s: but what entirely alienated the affections of the people, was the unexpec$ed revocation of the two charters which he had &s;o &s;olemnly &s;worn to ob&s;erve; and which he now renounced, alleging that he could not be legally bound by any tran&s;action of his minority. As for Hubert, he &s;eemed to laugh at the mur|murs<NOTE PLACE="marg">B$a$$. T$$$e$. $. Pa$$$.</NOTE> of the people, and was in the cour&s;e of this year inve&s;ted with the earldom of Kent, as a recompence for having freed his ma&s;ter from &s;uch unea&s;y $etters.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XIX.</HEAD>
<P>This conduct of the king and his mini&s;ter produced an univer&s;al &s;p$rit of di&s;&s;a$isfaction among the barons; and prince Richard, lately arrived from Guienne, took the advantage of this alienation to in&s;ult his brother, in con&s;e$uence of a quarrel about a German who&s;e name was Walleran, on whom king John had be&s;towed &s;ome lands in Cornwal. When Richard received the inve&s;titure of this county, he &s;ummoned Walleran to produce his title; and in the mean time &s;eized his e&s;tate. The German, in&s;tead of &s;hewing his charter, complained to the king, in his brother's ab&s;ence; and an order was i&s;&s;ued for putting him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his lands. The va&s;&s;als and agents of the earl eluded the execution of this order till the return of Richard, who a&s;&s;ured the king that he had no intention to injure Walleran; and that he wo$ld refer the di&s;pute to the judgment of his peers. Henry, incen&s;ed at this declaration, which he con&s;trued into an appeal from his determination, chid $im &s;everely for his pre&s;umption, and commanded him to re&s;tore the lands
<PB N="469" REF="4780">
or quit the kingdom immediately. Richard replied that he would neither do the one nor the other, without the deci&s;ion of his peers; and immediately retired to his own hou&s;e. The ju&s;ticiary advi&s;ed the king to arre&s;t him without de|lay; but, while he wavered in his re&s;olution, the earl &s;et out for Marlborough, where he communicated the tran&s;action to William Mare&s;chal, earl of Pem|broke, who approved of his behaviour, and undertook to form an a&s;&s;ociation for humbling the pride of the ju&s;ticiary. With this view they vi&s;ited the earl of Che$$er, and &s;ome other noblemen, who embraced their plan without $$|&s;itation, and appointed a rendezvous at Stamford, whe$e they we$e met by the earls of Glouce&s;ter, Warenne, Hereford, Ferrars, and War$i$k, with a great number of gentlemen, attended by a va&s;t multitude of armed va&s;&s;als. There they publi&s;hed a manife&s;to, containing their grievances; and demanded the confirmation of the charters, together with the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of Hubert from the king's councils. The ju&s;ticiary fore&s;eeing the dangerous con&s;equences that might en&s;ue from this in&s;urrection, advi&s;ed the king to convoke a general a&s;&s;embly at Northampton, with promi&s;e to redre&s;s the grievances of the na|tion; and in the mean time, to detach prince Richard from the confederacy, by ceding in his favour &s;ome claims to the effects of his mother, and adding to his appointments the lands which the count de Boulogne had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in England. The&s;e &s;ea&s;onable conce&s;&s;ions operated &s;o effectually upon the mind of the earl, that he renounced his engagements with the nobility, who, finding them&s;elves thus bere&s;t of their leader, laid a&s;ide their de&s;ign, and &s;ubmitted to the king, on his promi&s;e to govern according to the laws of the realm.</P>

<P>About this period Gregory IX. &s;ucceeded to the papacy, at the death<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1228$</NOTE> of Honorius III. who was &s;urvived but a few months by Stephen Langton, ar$hbi&s;hop of Canterbury. This prelate's eyes were no &s;ooner clo&s;ed than the monks of St. Augu&s;tin, in order to pre&s;erve their privilege, elected one of their brothers, called Walter de Hemi&s;ham, without even demanding the king's permi&s;&s;ion. Henry therefore refu&s;ed to confirm his election, on pretence of his father's having been hang'd for felony; and the &s;uffragans of Canterbury, who likewi&s;e pretended to the right of election, found a pretext for refu&s;ing to own this new archbi&s;hop, who it &s;eems had debauched a nun, by whom he had &s;everal children. Agents were &s;ent with appeals to Rome; but the pope declined deciding the di&s;pute, until he &s;hould be better informed of the parti|culars; and in the mean time the &s;ee remained vacant. His holine&s;s at that time could not attend to &s;uch petty conte&s;ts, &s;o much was he engro&s;&s;ed by his quarrel with Frederic II. emperor of Germany, whom he now excommuni|cated for having deferred his voyage to the Holy Land, according to the oath he had taken. This &s;entence excited &s;uch commotions in Germany and Italy, that Frederic was obliged to perform his vow. France was at the &s;ame time embroiled by the regency of Blanche; and had Henry been an enterprizing prince, he might have taken the advantage of this conjuncture, to retrieve his paternal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions on the continent. The Normans, who had engaged in the intere&s;t of the French barons, again&s;t the regency, a&s;&s;ured the king of England, that if he would cro&s;s the &s;eas, they would receive him with open arms. The Poitevins pre&s;&s;ed him to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their country; in which ca$e they would a&s;&s;i&s;t him in expelling the French garri&s;ons; and the Ga$cons deputed the archbi&s;hop of Bourdeaux to invite him to come and re|cover

the i$heritance of Guienne. Such pre&s;&s;ing invitations one would ima|gine &s;hould have been very acceptable to any prince of common courage and di&s;cretion; e&s;pecially to one who had no dome&s;tic troubles to fear: for Henry had ju&s;t concluded a peace with Llewellyn, a prince of Wales, who had made &s;ome incur&s;ions upon the Engli&s;h borders. Neverthele&s;s, he declined their pro|po&s;als, ob&s;erving he would chu&s;e a more proper opportunity; whereas, &s;uch another could not be expected during the whole cour&s;e of his reign; and he afterwards ra&s;hly undertook the expedition, without the lea&s;t probability of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">R$$er. M. Paris.</NOTE> Mean while, the pope &s;till delayed giving judgment in the di&s;pute concerning the archbi&s;hopric of Canterbury, until the king's envoys made an offer to the pope of the tenth of all moveables in England and Ireland. This propo&s;ition threw a new light upon the conte&s;t, and his holine&s;s immediately annulled the election of the monks; but, at the &s;ame time he arrogated to him&s;elf the power of filling up the vacancy, appointing by his own autho|rity Richard le Grant, chancellor of the church of Lincoln, to the archiepi&s;|copal dignity; and this prelate was recognized by the king and the &s;uffragans, who on this occa&s;ion betrayed the rights of the Anglican church. In a little time after this tran&s;action, the pope &s;ent over one of his chaplains to collect the promi&s;ed tythe, in order to &s;upport a war again&s;t the emperor; and he pre&s;ented the pontiff's letter to the great council of the kingdom, de&s;iring that this aid might be levied without delay. All the members were a&s;toni&s;hed at the propo&s;al, and turned their eyes upon the king, expecting that he would di&s;claim the conduct of his envoys, who had made &s;uch an extravagant pro|mi&s;e: but they &s;oon perceived by his &s;ilence, that the offer had been made by his direction; and, in the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of their indignation, re&s;olved that their va&s;&s;als &s;hould not be expo&s;ed to any &s;uch exaction. Neverthele&s;s, as a mark of their re&s;pect to his holine&s;s, they agreed to grant him a donation, without proceeding to an inquiry into the effects of individuals. They were, however, diverted from executing this re&s;olution, by the behaviour of Stephen Seagrave, one of the riche&s;t and mo&s;t popular members of the a&s;&s;embly, who voluntarily &s;ubmitted to the tax; and a great number was influenced by his example, till at la&s;t the whole council, including eccle&s;ia&s;tics as well as lay|men, acquie&s;$ed in the demand, rather than incur the wrath of the king, and the cen&s;ures of Gregory. This point being &s;ettled, the nuncio produced a commi&s;&s;ion inve&s;ting him with full power to levy the tax upon all moveables what&s;oever. He forthwith proceeded to the execution of his orders, and ex|acted the tythe with &s;uch rigour, that the people were obliged to pay ready money for the fruits of the earth even while growing: the prelates and abbots were compelled to advance the tax for their inferior clergy; and, as they could not conveniently rai&s;e the &s;ums demanded, they were &s;upplied by Italian u&s;urers, whom the nuncio had brought along with him for this purpose. The earl of Che&s;ter, however, in&s;i&s;ted upon his prerogative of palatine, and would not &s;uffer the nuncio, or any of his agents, to &s;et foot within his terri|tories.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch. Du$&s;taple. M.

<P>Before the people had time to breathe, after this grievous burden,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1229.</NOTE> they were again oppre&s;&s;ed with &s;ub$$dies, to enable the king to equip an arma|ment again&s;t France, now that he had no longer an opportunity to pro&s;ecute the war with advantage. He &s;ummoned all the nobility and gentlemen of England to attend him at Port&s;mouth, immediately after Michaelmas, where they a&s;&s;embled to a va&s;t multitude, from all parts of the kingdom, be&s;ides a great number of volunteers from Ireland, Wales, and Scotland. But, all the &s;uc|ce&s;s that might have been expected from &s;uch an army was prevented by the neglect of the ju&s;ticiary, who had not provided a &s;ufficient number of ve&s;&s;els for its tran&s;portation. Henry is &s;aid to have been &s;o much incen&s;ed at this omi&s;&s;ion, that he drew his &s;word, in order to &s;acrifice Hubert with his own hand, and was hardly witheld by the noblemen who interpo&s;ed. This is a circum&s;tance very incompatible with the di&s;po&s;ition of the king, who &s;tood in awe of the ju&s;ticiary, and could &s;carce have been provoked to &s;uch an effort of re&s;olution. The enterprize &s;eems to have been po&s;tponed for want of money to pay &s;uch a multitude of &s;oldiers, and in con&s;equence of what was &s;ugge&s;ted by the count of Brittany, who had by this time arrived at Port&s;|mouth, in order to conduct the expedition; and di&s;&s;uaded the king from hazarding a voyage in the winter &s;ea&s;on. The troops were accordingly di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed; and the count having obtained a grant of the honour of Richmond, with a &s;upply of five thou&s;and marks in ready money, returned to his own country, where he publi&s;hed a manife&s;to repre&s;enting his grievances, and renouncing his allegiance to the king of France.</P>

<P>The expedition being thus po&s;tponed, Henry made a progre&s;s to<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Then he convoked an a&s;&s;embly, and obtained a con&s;iderable &s;cutage for defraying the expence of another armament. The rendezvous of his army was appointed at Reading, for the beginning of April; from thence he marched to Port&s;mouth, and embarking about the latter end of the &s;ame month, arrived at St. Malo. There he was received by the count, who &s;urrendered &s;everal &s;trong places into his hands; and a great number of the nobility did homage to him as their &s;overeign. The king of France had already taken Angers, in the neighbourhood of which his army was po&s;ted to ob&s;erve the motions of the Engli&s;h, and oppo&s;e their irruption into Poitou; but &s;eeing Henry did not move from Nantes, he advanced towards Amiens on the Loire, which he inve&s;ted and took, together with &s;everal places in the neighbourhood of Henry's quarters, without meeting with the lea&s;t interrup|tion from that prince, who &s;pent his time in fea&s;ting and riot, as if he had cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea to take his diver&s;ion. Notwith&s;tanding the prudent admini&s;tra|tion of the queen regent of France, the di&s;contented noblemen, in hope of being &s;u&s;tained by Henry, took this opportunity of their own king's ab&s;ence, to excite fre&s;h commotions, which obliged Lewis to quit Anjou, that he might reduce tho&s;e malecontents; and this was a favourable juncture for Henry, to recover the dominions which his father had lo&s;t. The king of France had withdrawn his forces, and the Normans earne&s;tly &s;ollicited the king of Eng|land to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their country; but, in&s;tead of marching into Nor|mandy, he entered Poitou, where he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Mire$eau; then repaired to Guienne, to receive the homage of the Ga&s;con barons; and, la&s;tly,
<PB N="472" REF="4810">
returned into Brittany, where he relap&s;ed into his former indolence, as if he had re&s;tricted him&s;elf by oath from interrupting Lewis, in the pacification of his realms. His conduct was &s;o amazingly impolitic and ab&s;urd on this occa&s;ion, that his mini&s;ters were &s;u&s;pected of carrying on an intelligence with the enemy; and Lewis effected an accomodation with the confederated ba|rons, who &s;aw they had nothing to expect from the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of England. By this time Henry was heartily tired of the war, and his forces daily dimi|ni&s;hing from intemperance, he agreed to leave four hundred knights, and a body of hor&s;e, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the count of Brittany, while he &s;hould maintain the war with France, and to remit &s;ix thou&s;and marks for his &s;ervice, as &s;oon as he &s;hould arrive in England. His re&s;olution to quit Britanny was ha&s;tened by the mo|tions of the French king and the regent, who having appea&s;ed the inte&s;tine troubles of France, marched back to oppo&s;e the Engli&s;h; and Henry, at their approach, embarked &s;uddenly for England. Yet the earls of Che&s;ter, Albemarle, and Pembroke, who were left behind with the troops above|mentioned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$mer. M. Paris. D$cnery's Spi|$$$.</NOTE> exerted them&s;elves with great activity and re&s;olution, after the king's departure.

<P>During Henry's ab&s;ence Ireland had been involved in troubles. The king of Connaught knowing the be&s;t of the Engli&s;h troops were with|drawn from that kingdom, to &s;erve in the expedition again&s;t Brittany, re|&s;olved to take the advantage of their ab&s;ence, and a&s;&s;embling a va&s;t number of va&s;&s;als, invaded the lands of the Briti&s;h proprietors, which he wa&s;ted with fire and &s;word, until he was encountred by Geoffrey de Mari&s;co, ju&s;ticiary of Ireland, who took him pri&s;oner, after having routed his army with great<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

This event in &s;ome mea&s;ure con&s;oled the nation for the mi&s;carriage of Henry's foreign expedition, which he had &s;o di&s;gracefully mi&s;managed; and yet he u&s;ed it as a pretext for rai&s;ing further &s;ub&s;idies. He had exhau&s;ted his finances abroad in such an extravagant manner, that he was a meer beggar at his return; and what the great council would have refu&s;ed to his demand at another time$ they now granted to his indigence. There was nothing affable or engaging in the character of Henry; &s;o that he never could attach a noble|man to his intere&s;t by the ties of affection: but, as he &s;eized all opportunities of exerting the odious prerogatives of his royalty, Richard, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, having complained to him of the behaviour of Hubert de Burgh, who had &s;eized the ca&s;tle of Tunbridge, tho' it was a fief of the archbi&s;hopric, he replied, that the young earl of G$ouce&s;ter being a ward of the crown, he had a right to di&s;po&s;e of the ca&s;tle during his minority; and that Richard was pre&s;umpt$ous in pretending to di&s;pute that privilege.

<P>Henry's imperious di&s;po&s;ition was about this time manife&s;ted in another difference with one of the fir&s;t $span$ his kingdom. The earl of Pembroke dying in $rittany, was &s;ucce$ded by his brother Richard, who had accompanied him in the expedition, and di&s;tingui$h$d him&s;el$ on divers occa|&s;ions by his ga$lantry and conduct. $word$ his undoubted right and

&s;ervices, the king &s;eized the e&s;tate as &s;oon as he received the news of the bro|ther's death; and a truce being afterwards concluded with France, Richard returned to England, and demanded the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Henry at fir&s;t pretended, that the late earl's widow was pregnant; but that allegation being di&s;proved, he charged Richard with having carried on a trea&s;onable corre&s;pondence with the enemy; and ordered him to quit the kingdom in fifteen days. Such an arbi|trary and unju&s;t &s;entence mu&s;t have incen&s;ed any Engli&s;h nobleman; but it was particularly provoking to the &s;on of that earl of Pembroke who had placed the crown on his head, and &s;upported him again&s;t all the efforts of his ene|mies. Richard obeyed the order literally, in quitting the kingdom; but he retired into Ireland, where he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the lands belonging to his fa|mily; and a&s;&s;embling a body of troops, ravaged the crown deme&s;nes, and thus made him&s;elf amends for the damage he had &s;u&s;tained. This was the mo&s;t ef|fectual way of dealing with a prince of Henry's character. Alarmed at Richard's progre&s;s, he recalled him from exile, re&s;tored his e&s;tate, and inve&s;t|ed him with the office of earl mare&s;chal, which his brother had enjoyed. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat.

<P>Henry was timorous, ra&s;h, and irre&s;olute in every part of his conduct. Lllewellyn, prince of Wales, having renewed his incur&s;ions, the king allowed him to ravage the borders with impunity; and, after he had re|turned with his plunder, marched again&s;t him, at the head of a numerous ar|my: but, he no &s;ooner met with difficulties and oppo&s;ition, than his ardour cooled, and he returned, without having reduced the enemy, or done any thing worthy of notice. The &s;ame incon&s;tancy and irre&s;olution appeared in the dif|ferent &s;chemes of matrimony which he projected. He was now in the twenty|fifth year of his age, and had propo&s;ed marriage to &s;everal prince&s;&s;es: he had engaged him&s;elf by oath to Yolante, daughter of the count of Brittany; he had demanded the daughter of the duke of Au&s;tria; he had expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of uniting him&s;elf clo&s;ely with the empire, by means of a match with a prince&s;s of Bohemia; and now he re&s;olved to e&s;pou&s;e the &s;econd daughter of William, late king of Scotland. All the&s;e alliances mi&s;carried, through Henry's own levity, except the la&s;t, which was prevented by the remon&s;trances of the nobi|lity, who repre&s;ented the di&s;grace that would attend his marriage with the younger &s;i&s;ter of his ju&s;ticiary's wife.

<P>Richard, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who had repaired to Rome with complaints again&s;t John and his ju&s;ticiary, concerning the ca&s;tle of Tun|bridge, did not meet with the &s;ucce&s;s he expected: Henry had &s;ent over an agent to ju&s;tify his conduct; and the pope, who&s;e intere&s;t it was to oblige this weak prince, i&s;&s;ued a bull, forbidding the prelates of England to excommuni|cate the king's mini&s;ters and officers, for maintaining the rights of the crown to ca&s;tles and other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. Richard dying, on his return the monks of Canterbury proceeded immediately to a new election, and cho&s;e Ralf de Ne|ville, bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter and chancellor of the kingdom, to fill the vacant &s;ee; a choice &s;o agreeable to the king, that he forthwith approved of the election, and put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the temporalities; yet he could not ob|tain

the confirmation of the pope, to whom Simon Langton repre&s;ented him as a prelare devoted to the prerogatives of the crown, in oppo&s;ition to the autho|rity of the Roman church. His election was therefore &s;et a&s;ide; and the monks were ordered to choo&s;e another, who being as di&s;agreeable to his holi|ne&s;s as Ralf, they pitched upon a third, who was likewi&s;e rejected, and at la&s;t elected Edmund, trea&s;urer of the church of Salisbury, who was cho&s;en by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat$ Paris.</NOTE> pope's own recommendation.</P>
<P N="28">XXVIII. The court of Rome had by this time u&s;ed its influence in &s;uch an unpopular manner, that a general clamour aro&s;e all over England, again&s;t the practice of be&s;towing benefices upon Italian prie&s;ts, and inhibiting Engli&s;h bi|$hops and lay patrons to pre&s;ent natives, until tho&s;e foreigners &s;hould be pre|ferred. This was con&s;idered as a national in&s;ult and grievance, and a number of a&s;&s;ociations were formed for delivering the kingdom from &s;uch &s;hameful op|pre&s;&s;ion. Circular letters were &s;ent to bi&s;hops and chapters, warning them again&s;t favouring &s;uch encroachments, on pain of having their hou&s;es burned, and their farms de&s;troyed. Cincio, a Roman prebendary of St. Paul's, was apprehended, in the neighbourhood of St. Alban's, by a number of men in vi|zards, who confined him for five weeks, and obliged him to pay a con&s;iderable ran&s;om for his liberty: the barns of the Italian clergy were broke open, and their corn either given to the poor, or &s;old in public; and when the civil ma|gi&s;trate interpo&s;ed, counterfeit warrants were produced by the rioters, who ge|nerally appeared to the number of four&s;core, on all &s;uch occa&s;ions. In this manner they proceeded for &s;ome time, without oppo&s;ition, and the foreign ec|cle&s;ia&s;tics took refuge in convents, for the &s;ecurity of their per&s;ons. The pope being informed of this violence, wrote a letter to the king, in&s;i&s;ting upon his puni&s;hing the delinquents with the utmo&s;t rigour; otherwi&s;e he would excom|municate his per&s;on, and lay his dominions under an interdict. Henry, &s;tartled at the&s;e menaces, appointed inqui&s;itions in different parts of the kingdom, where tho&s;e di&s;orders had prevailed; and it &s;oon appeared, that they had been countenanced by every rank and degree of people in the kingdom. Bi&s;hops, abbots, knights, &s;heriffs, and e&s;quires, were found to have been concerned as acce&s;&s;ories or abettors, and the ju&s;ticiary him&s;elf was &s;u&s;pected of having con|nived at the pillage, and &s;creened the rioters from per&s;ecution. At la&s;t, Ro|bert<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1232.</NOTE> de Twange, a gallant young knight, who, under the name of W. Wither, had headed them in their excur&s;ions, appeared in the king's pre&s;ence, and owned him&s;elf the ringleader in all the&s;e expeditions again&s;t the Romans, who, he &s;aid, had endeavoured to deprive him of the only patronage he enjoyed. Henry was plea&s;ed with his appearance and frank confe&s;&s;ion; and as the bi&s;hop of London and another prelate had excommunicated all concerned in tho&s;e riots, he &s;ent him to Rome, with letters recommending him to the pope's indul|gence.</P>

<P>Though this young adventurer fully cleared Hubert of all &s;u&s;pi|cion, his profe&s;&s;ed enemy Peter de Roches, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, in&s;inuated to the pope, that the ju&s;ticiary was actually concerned in the outrages com|mitted again&s;t the Italian clergy; and by the&s;e in&s;inuations added the influence of his holine&s;s to the confederacy which was already formed at court to the prejudice of Hubert. This nobleman had, by his pride and arbitrary di&s;po&s;i|tion, not only di&s;gu&s;ted almo&s;t all the peers of the realm, but al&s;o become di&s;|agreeable
<PB N="475" REF="4840">
to the king, who&s;e ficklene&s;s di&s;po&s;ed him to novelty and alteration in mini&s;ters as well as mea&s;ures. The ju&s;ticiary's enemies no &s;ooner &s;ound Henry's ears open to their repre&s;entations, than they a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly calumniated the conduct and character of the mini&s;ter: they prevailed upon the king to re|call the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter to court; and that prelate captivated the heart and admiration of this weak prince by &s;umptuous entertainments and magnifi|cent pre&s;ents. As he gained ground in his maje&s;ty's favour, he filled the court with his relations and adherents; and now that he was e&s;tabli&s;hed in his good graces, re&s;olved to employ all his addre&s;s in augmenting his aver&s;ion to the ju&s;ticiary. The prince of Wales having made &s;ome incur&s;ions into the Engli&s;h territories with impunity, the bi&s;hop, who had &s;ignalized his courage and mi|litary capacity in the Holy Land, expo&s;tulated with the king upon the di&s;grace of &s;itting tamely, and &s;eeing his dominions ravaged by a handful of naked &s;a|vages. When Henry gave him to under&s;tand that his finances were &s;carce &s;ufficient to defray the expences of his hou&s;hold, much le&s;s to maintain a war again&s;t his neighbours, Peter loudly inveighed again&s;t the conduct of the prime mini&s;ter; affirming that his revenues were mi&s;managed and embezzled; that the ward&s;hips of the crown were be&s;towed upon individuals, without pro|ducing any advantage to the exchequer; that the income of vacant benefices was intercepted, as well as that of lands reverting to the crown by death or confi&s;cation; and that, by the help of hone&s;t officers and proper oeconomy, he might, like his predece&s;&s;ors, keep his coffers always full, and his &s;way inde|pendent of the general a&s;&s;embly. This was a doctrine that &s;ounded very agre|ably in the ears of Henry, who was equally indigent, rapacious, and aver&s;e to national councils: he forthwith ordered all his &s;heriffs and officers of the reve|nue to produce their accounts. Some of them being detected in frauds, were deprived of their offices, and impri&s;oned. Ralf Brito, trea&s;urer of the cham|ber, was fined in a thou&s;and pounds, and his po&s;t be&s;towed upon Peter de Ri|vaux, nephew to the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter. The&s;e were previous &s;teps which that prelate took to pave the way for the execution of his grand project. Hav|ing thus removed the dependents of Hubert, who&s;e credit daily dimini&s;hed, he at length prevailed upon the king to dive&s;t that mini&s;ter of his office of ju&s;ti|ciary, and confer it upon Stephen de Seagrave, the bi&s;hop's creature and chief favourite, although Hubert had enjoyed it by a patent for life. Not contented with this triumph over his rival, he per&s;uaded Henry to call him to account for the &s;ums of money which had pa&s;&s;ed through his hands during his admini&s;tra|tion; and Hubert endeavoured to avoid this inquiry, by producing a patent of king John, containing an ample di&s;charge for all the money he had received in the cour&s;e of his faithful &s;ervices to his &s;overeign. The bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, who was pre&s;ent, told him that &s;uch an acquittance could have no effect upon his admini&s;tration &s;ince the acce&s;&s;ion of his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty: and added, that this was not the only crime laid to his charge; for he was accu&s;ed of divers crimes and mi&s;demeanours; and, in particular, of having given the king per|nicious coun&s;el, to the un&s;peakable prejudice of his affairs. Hubert perceiv|ing that this prelate was bent upon his ruin, and that the king's heart was al|together alienated, de&s;ired that he might be indulged with time to prepare for his defence; and this demand the bi&s;hop could not refu&s;e, without running the risk of di&s;obliging the barons, by excluding Hubert $rom a privilege he en|joyed

in common with all the noblemen of the kingdom. The earl of Kent having intimation that Peter was determined upon bringing him to an igno|mi$$$$s death, and finding it very difficult to unravel a number of perplexed accounts, retired to the priory of Merton, in Surry, where he took &s;anctuary; and the king, who&s;e re&s;entment again&s;t him was now as rancorous as his for|mer confidence had been unbounded and implicit, ordered the mayor of Lon|don to bring him from his retreat, either dead or alive. This order being re|ceived in the evening, Roger Duke the mayor a&s;&s;embled the populace with the alarm ball; and having &s;ignified the king's command, directed them to pro|vide arms, &s;o as to march in the morning to execute the king's order. No|thing could be more agreeable than &s;uch an office to the vulgar, who hated Hubert ever &s;ince the execution of their favourite leader Con&s;tantine; and they di&s;per&s;ed with joy to make preparations for the enterprize. Mean while &s;everal citizens of di&s;tingui&s;hed note and di&s;cretion, dreading the con&s;equences of &s;uch a tumultuary meeting, repaired to the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter in South|wark, and even waked him from his &s;leep, to repre&s;ent the danger that might en&s;ue to the church of Merton and the city it&s;elf, from the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uch a di&s;orderly multitude. The prelate, in&s;tead of acting up to the duty of his function, by interpo&s;ing his influence with the king, to procure a revoca|tion of the order, told them, that whatever might be the con&s;equence, they ought to obey his maje&s;ty's command. Thus encouraged, the populace, to the amount of twenty thou&s;and armed men, marched out in the morning, with colours flying, towards the church of Merton, where Hubert &s;at on his knees before the altar, expecting his death with fortitude and re&s;ignation. What the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter ought to have procured without being &s;ollicited, was obtained by the remon&s;trances of the earl of Che&s;ter, who, though a pro|fe$$ed enemy of Hubert, repre&s;ented to the king, that &s;uch tumultuary pro|ceedings might produce a very dangerous &s;edition, and furni&s;h the world with a handle to reproach him with ingratitude to a nobleman who&s;e whole life had been dedicated, in a remarkable manner, to the &s;ervice of him&s;elf and his family. Henry, con&s;cious of the truth and hone&s;ty of this ob&s;ervation, and perhaps moved with the magnanimity of the earl, who could &s;o nobly &s;acra|$ice his re&s;entment to ju&s;tice and the intere&s;t of his country, &s;ent a counter|order to the mayor of London; and this, by the diligence of the bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter, was di&s;patched in time enough to prevent mi&s;chief; &s;o that the mul|titude returned to London extremely chagrined at their di&s;appointment. The archbi&s;hop of Dublin and the bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter were the only per&s;ons of note who adhered to the earl of Kent in his adver&s;ity; and they &s;econded the re|mon&s;trances of the earl of Che&s;ter with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that they obtained let|ters patent from the king, granting Hubert time to prepare for his trial before his peers. Tru&s;ting to the protection of this indulgence, he &s;et out for St. Edmund&s;bury on a vi&s;it to his wife; and the king, being informed that he intended to e&s;cape, &s;ent a detachment of three hundred men, to apprehend and bring him back pri&s;oner to the Tower. Godfrey de Craucombe, who commanded this party, $ound him in the chapel at Brentwood, with a cro&s;s in one hand, and the &s;acrament in the other: but, notwith&s;tanding the &s;anc|tity of his &s;ituation, he was dragged out by violence, and his feet being chained under a hor&s;e's belly, conveyed to pri&s;on like a common felon. Such indig|nities

offered to a nobleman, who had &s;ignalized his courage and fidelity above all his cotemporaries, and &s;at &s;o long at the helm of government, affected the very populace a&s;&s;embled on the occa&s;ion; even a black&s;mith, whom Crau|combe de&s;ired to fa&s;ten the fetters, refu&s;ed the employment with di&s;dain, and made an affecting &s;peech on the occa&s;ion. Next morning Roger, bi&s;hop of London, went to court, to complain of this breach of the church's privileges, and threatened all concerned in the outrage with excommunication, unle&s;s Hubert &s;hould be immediately relea&s;ed. The king accordingly ordered him to be carried back to the chapel; but, at the &s;ame time, the &s;heriffs of Hert|ford and E&s;&s;ex were directed to rai&s;e the po&s;&s;e, and &s;urround the place in &s;uch a manner, as that he &s;hould neither e&s;cape nor receive &s;u&s;tenance: nay, &s;uch was the virulence of Henry's hatred, that he forbade all his courtiers to inter|cede in his behalf; and the alternative he offered to Hubert was perpetual exile, perpetual impri&s;onment, or the confe&s;&s;ion of his trea&s;on. The earl, con&s;cious of his own merit and innocence, refu&s;ed to buy his life on &s;uch &s;can|dalous conditions; and, after having remained a whole month in the chapel, half fami&s;hed, he &s;urrendered him&s;elf to the &s;heriff, who reconveyed him to the tower in &s;hackles. The king being informed that he had depo&s;ited a con&s;ider|able trea&s;ure in the hands of the Templars, demanded it of the ma&s;ter, who refu&s;ed to deliver it without Hubert's order, which was immediately granted. Though this trea&s;ure furni&s;hed his enemies with a new pretence for expa|tiating upon his fraud and extortion, it appea&s;ed the indignation of Henry, who now affected to remember his great &s;ervices; and when he was urged to proceed again&s;t the earl with the utmo&s;t &s;everity, declared that he would never con&s;ent to the death of a nobleman to whom he and his father had owed &s;uch important obligations. He now li&s;tened to terms of compo&s;ition; and Hu|bert, after having conveyed to Henry all his per&s;onal e&s;tate, and the lands he held of the crown, was allowed to enjoy the re&s;t of his fortunes: in the mean time, the earls of Cornwal, Warrenne, Pembroke, and Lincoln, became &s;ureties for his good behaviour; but he was ordered to remain in the ca&s;tle of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann.

<P>The bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, in&s;tead of taking warning from the di&s;|grace<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1233.</NOTE> of Hubert de Burgh, &s;eemed to think his own power e&s;tabli&s;hed, by that event, beyond any po&s;&s;ibility of being &s;haken, and erected an ab&s;olute autho|rity upon the ruins of that mini&s;ter. He per&s;uaded the king, that very few of his nobility were well affected to his government; and that he &s;hould never render him&s;elf independent, while they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the great offices of the king|dom: he therefore advi&s;ed him to undermine their power gradually, by de|priving them of their lucrative po&s;ts and governments, which he might be&s;tow upon foreigners, who would always be devoted to his plea&s;ure. Henry, who hated the barons, reli&s;hed this advice, and, in a little time, above two thou|&s;and knights arrived in England from Ga&s;cony and Poitiers, the native coun|try of the bi&s;hop and his nephew Peter de Rivaux, who had invited them to &s;hare the &s;poils of the nation. The&s;e were provided with advantageous em|ployments, taken from the Engli&s;h barons, who could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to part with them in good humour: they were even intru&s;ted with the ward&s;hip of minors, by which they procured advantageous matches, to the prejudice of the

natives. The&s;e proceedings could not fail to produce clamours and di&s;content, among the nob$l$ty Richard, earl of Pembroke, was the fir&s;t who ventured to complain op$nly of this impolitic attachment to &s;trangers. He told the king, that this partiality to foreigners alienated the affections of his people, and produced &s;uch di&s;content as would be attended with dangerous con&s;equen|ces; and frankly a&s;&s;ured his maje&s;ty, that &s;hould he continue to lavi&s;h his fa|vours upon &s;trangers, in preference of his Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, the barons would be obliged to concert mea&s;ures for delivering the kingdom from &s;uch rapacious interlopers. The bi&s;hop, who was pre&s;ent at this expo&s;tulation, immediately replied, that his in&s;olence de&s;erved cha&s;ti&s;ement, for pretending to deprive his lovereign of the liberty to employ tho&s;e whom he judged mo&s;t proper for his &s;ervice; and that if the foreigners already in the kingdom were not &s;ufficient to reduce his rebellious &s;ubjects, a greater number &s;hould be brought over for that purpo&s;e. Such an arrogant declaration could not but be extremely &s;hocking to the noblemen of England: they forthwith retired from court, and began to form a&s;&s;ociations for their mutual defence; while the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter &s;eemed to de&s;pi&s;e their re&s;entment, confiding in his Poitevins, who now flocked over in great numbers. The earls and barons being &s;ummoned to an a&s;&s;embly or parliament at Oxford, to be held at Mid&s;ummer, they refu&s;ed to expo&s;e them|&s;elves to the in&s;ults and treachery of perfidious foreigners. They received a &s;e|cond and third citation, with promi&s;e that their grievances &s;hould be redre&s;&s;ed; but, under&s;tanding that fre&s;h &s;warms of aliens arrived every day with military accoutrements, they, in&s;tead of appearing per&s;onally, &s;ent a deputation to the king, de&s;iring he would remove Peter, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, and his Poite|vins from his councils and kingdom; otherwi&s;e they &s;hould be obliged to expel him from the throne, and find out &s;ome more worthy prince to &s;way the &s;cepter of England.</P>

<P>Henry him&s;elf was terrified at this me&s;&s;age; but the bi&s;hop &s;oon di&s;pelled his apprehen&s;ions, by exaggerating his own military capacity, and the valour of his Poitevins, with whom he undertook to &s;ubdue tho&s;e in&s;olent traitors, who treated their prince with &s;uch indignity. It was re&s;olved that they &s;hould immediately feel the weight of his re&s;entment and arbitrary power. Gilbert Ba&s;&s;et being di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a manour, and applying to Henry for ju&s;tice, was in&s;ulted with the appellation of traitor, and ordered to quit the court on pain of being hanged; his brother-in-law Richard Siward was impri&s;oned, on pretence of having married without the king's licence; and all the &s;u&s;pected noblemen were commanded to give ho&s;tages for their peaceable behaviour. The earl mare&s;chal receiving intimation from his &s;i&s;ter, the counte&s;s of Cornwal, of a de&s;ign again&s;t his life, retired to Wales; but the other confederates appeared in parliament, properly armed for their own &s;e|curity. No re&s;olution was taken in this a&s;&s;embly, on account of the earl's ab|&s;ence; but, in a little time after it broke up, Winche&s;ter and Seagrave, per|&s;uaded the king to &s;ummon all who owed him military &s;ervices, to meet him in arms at Glouce&s;ter, on the fourteenth day of Augu&s;t. The earl of Pem|broke and the con&s;ederates refu&s;ing to obey this cit$$ion, Henry ordered them to be pro&s;cribed as traitors; their towns w$$$ burned, their ca&s;tles be&s;ieged, their lands ravaged, and their e&s;tates give$ to the Poitevin &s;ub&s;idiaries.

Lincoln, by means of a thou&s;and marks artfully di&s;tributed: at the &s;ame time Baldwin, count de Gui&s;nes, landed at Dover with a &s;trong body of Flemings, who joined the king at Glouce&s;ter. By this time earl mare&s;chal finding him&s;elf abandoned by three &s;uch powerful confederates, engaged in a league offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive with Llewellyn, and the Wel&s;h noblemen who had been for &s;ome time on very precarious terms with England; and Henry, reinforced by his foreigners, advanced to Hereford, in order to be&s;iege one of the earl's ca&s;tles. The garri&s;on defended it &s;o courageou&s;ly, that the be&s;iegers began to be in want of provi&s;ions, before they had made any progre&s;s in the enterprize. The king &s;aw no pro&s;pect of taking the place by force of arms; and, as it would be di&s;graceful to rai&s;e the &s;iege, &s;ome prelates were &s;ent to treat with the earl mare&s;chal, who agreed to &s;urrender the ca&s;tle, on a &s;olemn promi&s;e that it &s;hould be re&s;tored in a fortnight, and every grievance redre&s;&s;ed at the meeting of the parliament, which was convoked for the beginning of October. Winche&s;ter and Seagrave &s;wore to the performance of the&s;e articles; but, notwith&s;tanding their oath, the ca&s;tle was not re&s;tored, until it was be|&s;ieged, and retaken by the owner. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat.

<P>The parliament a&s;&s;embling at We&s;tmin&s;ter, be&s;ought the king to be reconciled to his barons, and complained of his pro&s;cribing Engli&s;h noblemen as traitors, without trial or conviction. The bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter not only pretended to ju&s;tify the king's conduct, but was &s;o imprudent as to affirm, that the Engli&s;h noblemen were not intiled to the privileges enjoyed by the peers of France. He had &s;carce pronounced this hardy a&s;&s;everation, when all the bi&s;hops ro&s;e up, and threatened him with the &s;ent&egrave;nce of excommunica|tion. He told them he was not &s;ubject to their juri&s;diction, as having been con&s;ecrated by the pope, to whom he appealed from any &s;tep they might take to his prejudice; and though they did not cen&s;ure him by name, they excom|municated all tho&s;e who alienated the king's affection from his &s;ubjects: but, when Henry pre&s;&s;ed them to fulminate the &s;ame &s;entence again&s;e the earl ma|re&s;chal, who had retaken his ca&s;tle, they refu&s;ed to comply with his reque&s;t, ob&s;erving that it would be highly unju&s;t to cen&s;ure a man for recovering his own property. The king therefore, finding him&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of at|tacking him in the field, ordered all his troops to rendezvous at Glouce&s;ter, immediately after All-Saints, and from thence began his march into Wales; but the earl having taken the precaution to drive away the cattle, his army was, in a little time, &s;o de&s;titute of forage and provi&s;ions, that he was obliged to change his route and enter Monmouth&s;hire, to prepare magazines for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of his forces. The earl, under&s;tanding that the king, and his principal officers were quartered in the ca&s;tle of Gro&s;mont, while the army lay encamped without the walls, attacked them in the night, routed them at the fir&s;t on&s;et, and took about &s;ix hundred hor&s;es, with all the king's baggage; &s;o that he was fain to return to Glouce&s;ter. Then Pembroke undertook the &s;iege of Monmouth, which was defended by Baldwin de Gui&s;nes, a Flemi&s;h officer of great reputation, who laid an ambu&s;h for the earl, and actually took him pri&s;oner, while he rode round, ob&s;erving the place with a few attendants: but, luckily for the earl, Baldwin was mortally wounded with an arrow, as he con|ducted his pri&s;oner to the ca&s;tle. His troops halting in con&s;equence of this accident, Pembroke's forces came up, and not only delivered their gene|ral,

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, Hubert de Burgh, who &s;till con|tinued a pri&s;on$r in the ca&s;tle of the Devizes, received an intimation, that the bi&s;hop o$ Winche&s;ter was determiued to take away his life; and that he might execute this re&s;ol$tion with the greater facility, was &s;olliciting the king for the government of the ca&s;tle. Alarmed at this intelligence, he communicated the nature of his dangerous &s;ituation to &s;ome of the guards who attended him, and they commi&s;erating the fate of this gallant man, connived at his e&s;cape. Of this, however, the governor was no &s;ooner informed, than he detached a party in pur$uit of the fugitive, whom they found at the foot of the altar in a country church, and carried back to the ca&s;tle, after having buffetted and in&s;ulted him<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$ Ch. 1234.</NOTE> with the utmo&s;t indignity. The bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury, being informed of this violation, demanded him of the governor; and, upon his refu&s;al to &s;urrender the pri&s;oner, excommunicated the whole garri&s;on. His complaints to the king were &s;econded by the bi&s;hop of London, who repre&s;ented this affront offered to the church, as a matter of &s;uch con&s;equence to Henry, that he ordered Hu|bert to be reconveyed to the place from whence he had been taken, which was, at the &s;ame time, &s;urrounded by the &s;heriff and his po&s;&s;e comitatus: &s;o that the pri&s;oner would have reaped no benefit from his removal, had not he been re&s;cued by Richard Siward and &s;ome armed friends, with whom he retired to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch.

<P>This nobleman made great progre&s;s after the king's retreat. He defeated a body of troops commanded by John of Monmouth, ravaged the lands belonging to the king's coun&s;ellors, in the frontiers of Wales, and re|duced the town of Shrew&s;bury to a&s;hes; while Henry, in&s;tead of oppo&s;ing his career, retired to Winche&s;ter, leaving the counties, on the Severne &s;ide, to his mercy. He was advi&s;ed by the bi&s;hop to make an accommodation with the earl; but this advice he rejected, at the in&s;tigation of Winche&s;ter, unle&s;s that nobleman would throw him&s;elf at his feet, and own him&s;elf a traitor. Indeed this prelate had a re&s;ource, of which tho&s;e coun&s;ellors were ignorant; he wrote letters, in the king's name, to Maurice Fitzgerald, ju&s;ticiary of Ireland, Walter and Hugh de Lacy, Richard de Burgh, Geoffrey de Mareis, and others, giv|ing them to under&s;tand, that Richard, earl mare&s;chal, had been deprived, in the king's court, of all his honours and e&s;tate; and de&s;iring they would ravage his lands in Ireland, &s;o as to provoke him to go thither: in which ca&s;e, if they would take him dead or alive, all his Iri&s;h fortune &s;hould be divided among them. Before they would engage in this undertaking, they demanded a pa|tent to confirm the partition; and this being &s;ealed and &s;ent over, they began to wa&s;te the lands belonging to Richard. He no &s;ooner heard of this unpro|voked injury, than he cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea with fifteen attendants, and, at his land|ing, was received by Geoffrey de Mareis, one of his own va&s;&s;als, with all the exterior marks of fidelity and attachment. This traitor engaged to rai&s;e troops for his &s;ervice, again&s;t tho&s;e who had invaded his e&s;tate, and inve$gled him into a parley with his colleagues; on which occa&s;ion, being de&s;erted by all his followers, he received a mortal &s;tab in the back with a poignard, of which he<NOTE PLACE="marg">M$$.

<P>While the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter and his adherents employed their influence to &s;uch infamous purpo&s;es, the prelates, in order to avert the mi&s;chievous con&s;equences that mu&s;t have attended the male practices of this wicked mini&s;try, re&s;olved to exert them&s;elves in behalf of their country. In a parliament at We&s;tmin&s;ter, Henry taxed &s;everal bi&s;hops, and Alexander of Litchfield in particular, with being engaged, in concert with the earl mare&s;chal, and the rebellious barons. The bi&s;hop, in order to demon&s;trate the fal&s;ity of the charge, ro&s;e up, and, in a &s;olemn manner, excommunicated all tho&s;e who were concerned in &s;uch trea&s;onable practices, as well as the calumniators of the bi&s;hops. Edmund, elect of Canterbury, not &s;atisfied with that cen&s;ure, re|paired with his &s;uffragans to court, and explained to Henry the ruinous mea|&s;ures to which he had been in&s;tigated by his mini&s;ters: he accu&s;ed Peter, bi|&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, as the author of tho&s;e pernicious coun&s;els, which had dif|fu&s;ed a &s;pirit of di&s;content through the whole nation; he repre&s;ented the danger of entru&s;ting mercenary foreigners with the cu&s;tody of his own &s;i&s;ter as well as Eleanor of Brittany, together with his trea&s;ury and the chief fortre&s;&s;es of the kingdom; and finally in&s;i&s;ted upon his removing tho&s;e evil coun&s;ellors, on pain of being excommunicated, with all his adherents. The king, &s;tartled at this remon&s;trance, de&s;ired time to deliberate, and his eyes &s;eemed to be opened all at once, to the danger that threatened him from his mi&s;conduct and partiality: neverthele&s;s, he formed no re&s;olution during this &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament. Before the next meeting Edmund was con&s;ecrated; &s;o that he renewed his addre&s;s with greater authority, and the king granted him all the &s;atisfaction he could de&s;ire; the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter was &s;ent to his dioce&s;e; Peter de Rivaux was di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed from his po&s;t of high trea&s;urer, and ordered to give up his accounts, together with the ca&s;tles in his cu&s;tody; Seagrave was dive&s;ted of his po&s;t of ju&s;ticiary; the foreigners were obliged to quit the country, and the Engli&s;h prelates and noblemen readmitted into the privy council.</P>

<P>Mea&s;ures immediately took a new turn; three bi&s;hops were &s;ent as amba&s;&s;adors, to conclude a peace with Llewellyn and the earl ma|re&s;chal; and the king him&s;elf &s;et out for Glouce&s;ter, that he might be at hand to forward the negotiation. In his way to that city, he was informed of Pem|broke's death, and could not help &s;hedding tears, when he under&s;tood how that worthy nobleman had been betrayed. Llewellyn con&s;ented to the propo&s;als of peace, on condition that the barons of his alliance &s;hould be pardoned and re|&s;tored; and they repaired to court, where they met with a very favourable re|ception from his maje&s;ty, who, among the re&s;t, di&s;tingui&s;hed Hubert de Burgh, with particular marks of tenderne&s;s and favour. The outlawries again&s;t that nobleman and the other con&s;ederates, were, by proclamation, declared null and void: he recovered his honours, and his former favour with the king; Ba&s;&s;et and Siward were created privy coun&s;ellors; Gilbert, bro|ther to the earl of Pembroke, received the inve&s;titure of the Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h e&s;tates; and Henry, having fir&s;t knighted him, delivered in$o his hands the mare&s;chal's &s;taff, at a parliament held in Worce&s;ter. It was at this a&s;&s;embly that Edmund, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, produced copies of the letters and forgeries which had been contrived, written, and &s;ealed, for the de&s;truction of the earl of Pembroke; and the whole audience was fill$d with horror and in|dignation, when they heard them recited. The perfidious authors were &s;um|moned
<PB N="482" REF="4910">
to appear in court at Mid&s;ummer, and an&s;wer to this and other charges of male admini&s;tration: but, in&s;tead of obeying the citation, Winche&s;ter and Rivaux took &s;anctuary in the cathedral of Winton; Seagrave retired to the church of St. Mary Newark in Leice&s;ter; and Pa&s;&s;elewe, one of their accom|plices, concealed him&s;elf in a cellar in London. Edmund, being aver&s;e to all violent mea&s;ures, per&s;uaded the king to grant them a &s;afe conduct; in con&s;e|quence of which they came forth from the places of their retreat, and were brought before the king for their examination. Peter de Rivaux appeared in the habit of a clergyman, under which a coat of mail and a &s;tiletto were con|cealed; he fell upon his knees and &s;ued for mercy, and de&s;ired time to regu|late his accompts of ward&s;hips, e&s;cheats, and other branches of the crown re|venue. His reque&s;t was granted, though his lay po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were &s;eque&s;tred, and his per&s;on was delivered to the archbi&s;hop, who &s;ent him to the cathedral of Winche&s;ter. Seagrave, be&s;ides the other articles of his charge, was accu&s;ed by Henry, of having advi&s;ed him to put Hubert de Burgh to death, and bani&s;h the nobility. He and Pa&s;&s;elewe, trea&s;urer of the exchequer, endeavoured to palliate their offences, by alledging they only conformed to the direction of their &s;uperiors, to whom they were &s;ub&s;ervient. They were fined a thou&s;and marks each; and Seagrave was obliged to re&s;tore &s;everal manours which had been alienated from the crown in his favour. As for the ringleader of this &s;o|reign mini&s;try, Peter bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, he &s;heltered him&s;elf under his<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cla$&s;. $word$ Henry III. $ymer.</NOTE> character, and was &s;ent abroad in order to renew the truce with France; but, the pope, being at war with the citizens of Rome, &s;ummoned him into Italy, where he hoped to avail him&s;elf of Peter's military talents.</P>

<P>While the king of England was thus employed in regulating his dome&s;tic officers, the truce with France expired; and, as the overtures made for a renewal of the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion did not &s;ucceed, Lewis invaded the count of Brittany, who earne&s;tly &s;ollicited &s;uccours from England: but Henry, far from &s;upporting this ally with that vigour which $ound policy required, &s;ent<NOTE PLACE="marg">$n.

During this interval, he exerted all his indu&s;try and eloquence, to engage Henry in an expedition for his relief; but all his endeavours proving ineffectual, he did homage to Lewis for his dominions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. Paris. Rymer.</NOTE> having fir&s;t &s;olemnly renounced his allegiance to Henry, who confi&s;cated his Engli&s;h e&s;tate. Tho' the king neglected his affairs upon the continent, his coun|cil were employed in making whole&s;ome regulations at home: the fortre&s;&s;es of the kingdom were put into the hands of Engli&s;h noblemen, well affected to their country; the boundaries between the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical policy of the kingdom, were a&s;certained by certain re&s;trictions, that prevented a mutual incroachment; and proclamations were i&s;&s;ued, to enforce a due ob&s;ervance of the two charters of liberties. Henry, by advice of his council, granted to the parochial clergy the tythes of hay and mills, in all deme&s;nes of the crown throughout England; he paid the tribute regularly to the pope; and, by the mediation of his holine&s;s, another truce for five years was concluded with<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<PB N="483" REF="4920">
of eight hundred livres, in lieu of the i&s;le of Oleron, to which he laid claim. It was al&s;o by the negotiation of pope Gregory, that the king of Eng|land acquired a powerful ally in the per&s;on of the emperor Frederic II. who demanded Henry's &s;i&s;ter I&s;abel in marriage. The propo&s;al was embraced; the articles of the contract immediately &s;ettled; the nobility granted a &s;cutage, by which thirty thou&s;and marks were levied as her fortune; &s;he was &s;ent with a numerous retinue into Germany, and there received with the utmo&s;t mag|nificence; and the nuptials were celebrated at Worms with incredible pomp, in pre&s;ence of four kings, eleven dukes, thirty marqui&s;&s;es and earls, be&s;ides a va&s;t number of prelates and gentlemen. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat.

<P>Henry, having thus di&s;po&s;ed of his &s;i&s;ter, began to think in good earne&s;t upon a match for him&s;elf. We have already taken notice of four different negotiations on this &s;ubject, which mi&s;carried through his own levity; but, now having arrived at the years of di&s;cretion, and perceiving the expedi|ency of &s;ettling the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, in order to pre&s;erve the peace of the kingdom, he re&s;olved to marry Eleanor, the &s;econd daughter of Raymund Berenger, count of Provence, who had already di&s;po&s;ed of his elde&s;t daughter to the king of France. The prelates and nobility approving of this alliance, Henry &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors with formal propo&s;als, which were very acceptable to the fa|ther. The young lady was conducted by the amba&s;&s;adors into England, where<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>In the a&s;&s;embly, convoked for this coronation, &s;everal regula|tions were made, and, among the re&s;t, the famous &s;tatute of Merton, relating to the dowers and wills of widows, the improvement of wa&s;te, the exemption of heirs from u&s;ury, during their minority, for debts contracted by their fa|thers, the limitation of writs, and other articles calculated for the ea&s;e and &s;e|curity of the people. Upon this occa&s;ion too, the bi&s;hops propo&s;ed to e&s;ta|bli&s;h a con&s;titution of the canon law, by which all children born before the marriage of their parents &s;hould be deemed legitimate by that &s;ub&s;equent union: but, as &s;uch an alteration would affect the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of titles and e&s;tates, and introduce confu&s;ion into families, the lay nobility declared they would never alter the laws of England. The &s;ame fortitude and re&s;olution they manife&s;ted in per&s;uading the king to refu&s;e the reque&s;t of the emperor, who &s;ent an em|ba&s;&s;y to de&s;ire that Richard, earl of Cornwal, might be &s;ent over to the impe|rial court, where he &s;hould be &s;upplied with troops to attack France, already embroiled by the king of Navarre, and recover the territories that were wre&s;ted from his father. The nobility interpo&s;ed with great warmth, and even prote&s;ted again&s;t expo&s;ing the pre&s;umptive heir of the crown to the dangers of war in a foreign country; and the emperor's propo&s;al was accordingly rejected.</P>

<P>The weakne&s;s of Henry &s;oon reappeared, notwith&s;tanding all the pains which the new mini&s;try took to regulate his conduct. William de Savorie, bi&s;hop elect of Valence, and uncle to queen Eleanor, whom he had conducted into England, infinuated him&s;elf &s;o artfully into the king's confi|dence and affection, that he re&s;igned him&s;elf intirely to the guidance of this fo|reigner, and managed the helm of government by his &s;ole direction. The Eng|li&s;h were always impatient of foreign councils; and as the nation &s;till &s;marted
<PB N="484" REF="4930">
from the pernicious mea&s;ures of Winche&s;ter and his Poitevins, the nobility re|&s;olved to cru&s;h this new influence before it &s;hould increa&s;e &s;o as to affect the welfare o$ the nation. When the next parliament was convened at London, this was the fir&s;t object of their con&s;ideration; and they pre&s;ented a remon&s;trance to the king, who was &s;o terrified at the addre&s;s that he retired to the Tower, where he propo&s;ed to fini&s;h the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;e&s;&s;$$n; but the members re|tu&s;ing to a&s;&s;emble in a place commanded by the very &s;trangers again&s;t whom their addre&s;s was levelled, he returned to his palace; and affairs were carried on in the u&s;ual channel. Notwith&s;tanding the truce wich Wales, mutual incur|&s;ions had been made, and Llewellyn &s;$emed inclinable to an open rupture with England. Alexander, king of Scotland, cho&s;e this conjuncture to &s;end an emba&s;&s;y to Henry with a demand of the three northern counties, agree|able to a convention made with his father, and a declaration of war, in ca&s;e of a refu&s;al. The council, finding both parts of the alternative equally di&s;|agreeable, amu&s;ed him with a promi&s;e of examining his preten&s;ions; and a con|ference was afterwards opened on this &s;ubject at York, where, by the media|tion of Otho, the pope's legate, a final peace was concluded; and Alexander renounced his claim, in con&s;ideration of two hundred pounds a year, payable by the northern counties, for which he &s;wore fealty and did homage to the king<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> of England: and as for Llewellyn, who was by this time old, infirm, and pa|ralytic, he agreed to a truce, which ended in a pacification.</P>

<P>The foreigners who had in&s;inuated them&s;elves into the king's favour, perceiving how odious they were to the Engli&s;h nobility, and the nation in general, re&s;olved to &s;trengthen their party again&s;t the &s;torm that was brewing. They prevailed upon Henry to di&s;mi&s;s Ralph Fitz-Nicholas, the lord &s;teward, and other officers, from the hou&s;ehold and council, and to de|mand the &s;eals from the bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter, who had behaved as chancellor with remarkable integrity; but this prelate refu&s;ed to re&s;ign his office, except by order of the council from which he had received his authority. Rivaux, Seagrave, and Pa&s;&s;elewe, were recalled to court, where they were reconciled to Henry and recovered their influence. The mea&s;ures for which they had been di&s;graced were now revived; the ca&s;tle of Glouce&s;ter and Eleanor of Brit|tany was recommitted to their charge; and in a word, they engro&s;&s;ed all the benefactions which Henry had in his power to be&s;tow. One would be apt to think tho&s;e in&s;olent &s;trangers had been hired by &s;ome rival prince to bring Henry's character into contempt and dete&s;tation with his own &s;ubjects. They exhorted him to revoke all the alienations of the crown deme&s;nes and grants made to the nobility before his marriage; they engaged the pope in this pro|ject. That pontiff publi&s;hed a bull, repre&s;enting tho&s;e grants as injurious to the honour of the crown, detrimental to his right of &s;overeignty, ab&s;olving Henry from the oath by which they had been confirmed, and directing an im|mediate re&s;umption. This mandate was &s;ignified to the parliament a&s;&s;embled at Winche&s;ter; but the members rejected the propo&s;al with di&s;dain, ob&s;erving that a compliance with the bull would be an acknowlegement of &s;ubjection to the Roman &s;ee, of which they con&s;idered the kingdom intirely independent.</P>

other re&s;ource, another parliament was convoked at We&s;tmin&s;ter, where the king giving them to under&s;tand that his finances were quite exhau&s;ted, by the expences attending his own marriage and the queen's coronation, de&s;ired they would grant him a &s;ub&s;idy for the nece&s;&s;ary purpo&s;es of his government. To this propo&s;al they an&s;wered, that the aids which they had &s;o often granted, were never employed for the glory or advantage of the nation; that on the con|trary he had &s;uffered the extent of his dominions to be curtailed by his enemies, and &s;quandered away the &s;ums of money, which ought to have been employed for the defence of his territories, among worthle&s;s foreigners who &s;upplanted his &s;ubjects in his favour, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in oppre&s;&s;ing the people. Henry faithfully promi&s;ed to be ruled for the future by the coun&s;els of his natural &s;ubjects; and that if they would now indulge him with the thirtieth part of their moveables, he would never a&s;k another &s;upply that they &s;hould &s;ee any rea&s;on to refu&s;e. In order to facilitate their compliance, he di&s;avowed the pope's bull touching the re&s;umption of grants; declared he would inviolably ob&s;erve the liberties of the Magna Charta; and ordered a &s;entence of excommunication to be pronounced again&s;t all per&s;ons (him&s;elf not excluded) who &s;hould pre&s;ume to violate that &s;acred con&s;titution <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The con&s;tituent members of that parliament were the prelates, the magi&s;trates, or great ba|rons, &s;ummoned by &s;pecial writs, and the ordi|nary barons or nobles, &s;ummoned in general by the &s;heriff's proclamation; the&s;e la&s;t compre|hended all the gentry that held by military tenure, whether knights or e&s;quires; and accordingly, Matthew Paris &s;ays there was at this parliament an infinite multitude: &s;o that they did not choo&s;e repre&s;entatives, but every individual appeared or might have appeared in his own per&s;on, as a member of parliament.

<P>In &s;pite of the&s;e precautions, Henry lavi&s;hed away the money upon his foreign favourites and his wife's relations. Tho' he had &s;olemnly engaged to follow the advice of Engli&s;h coun&s;ellors, he was &s;till directed in all his mea&s;ures by W. de Valence, on whom he conferred the honour of Rich|mond, which had formerly been granted to his own brother, the earl of Corn|wal. The avarice and ambition of this favourite gra&s;ped at every po&s;t of ho|nour and advantage, and gave &s;uch umbrage to the Engli&s;h nobility, that a civil commotion would probably have en&s;ued, had not he thought proper to withdraw on pretence of vi&s;iting his own country, where however, he &s;tayed no longer than he heard the re&s;entment of the Engli&s;h barons had &s;ub&s;ided: then he returned to the kingdom, where he renewed his arbitrary practices. Never|thele&s;s,

he was not &s;o free of apprehen&s;ion, but that he prevailed upon Henry to de&s;ire the pope would &s;end over a legate, who&s;e authority co$operating with the power of the crown, might overawe the malecontents and en&s;ure the obe|dience of the common people. Otho was inve&s;ted with this character, and his commission extended into Scotland; and though his arrival produced an uni|ver&s;al clamour, he conducted him&s;elf with &s;uch prudence and moderation as acquired the e&s;teem and veneration of the public. Alexander, king of Scot|land, forbade him to cro&s;s the borders; and indeed he felt no inclination to vi&s;it that country, after he had been made acquainted with the ferocity of the natives. He &s;ummoned a council at St. Paul's in London, where &s;everal canons were enacted, touching the di&s;cipline of the church; forbidding the practice of farming churches and eccle&s;ia&s;tical dignities, non-re&s;idence, and the marriage of the clergy; but he did not exert any unpopular acts of autho|rity; and employed his good offices in effecting a reconciliation between the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter and Hubert earl of Kent, who had long been at vari|ance. Yet the pre&s;ence of this legate animated Henry to proceed in be&s;tow|ing all his favo$$s and confidence on a foreign mini&s;try, and to di&s;regard the remon&s;trance of the Engli&s;h nobility, among whom his own brother Richard endeavoured without effect to per&s;uade him to a change of mea&s;ures.</P>

<P>Though he rejected this advice, his favourites found it nece&s;&s;ary to gain over &s;ome leaders of the oppo&s;ition, and to engage in their intere&s;t John, earl of Lincoln, high-con&s;table of England, and Simon de Montfort, earl of Leice&s;ter, younge&s;t &s;on of the famous general who commanded the cru&s;ade again&s;t the Albigen&s;es. He inherited the honour of Hinckley, the &s;teward&s;hip of England, and the county of Leice&s;ter, by the re&s;ignation of his brother Amaury, in right of his mother, who was daughter and coheire&s;s to Robert Fitz-Parnal, earl of Leice&s;ter. This young nobleman had ingratiated him&s;elf with Henry to &s;uch a degree, that his ambition &s;urmounted all bounds; and thinking him&s;elf too great for a &s;ubject, he a&s;pired to the dignity of &s;o|vereign. With this view he had payed his addre&s;&s;es &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to the hei|re&s;&s;es of Boulogne and Flanders; but mi&s;carrying in both negotiations, he turned his eyes upon Eleanor, the &s;econd &s;i&s;ter of Henry and widow of William de<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1238.</NOTE> Mare&s;chal, earl of Pembroke. Though &s;he had, at the decea&s;e of that noble|man, made a vow of perpetual cha&s;tity, and taken the ring without the veil from Edmund, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, the foreign mini&s;ters re&s;olving to attach Simon to their intere&s;t at any rate, per&s;uaded the king to con&s;ent to the marriage; and he actually gave her away with his own hand, in the private chapel of his palace, where the ceremony was performed by one of his chap|lains. The king was &s;everely rebuked for this clande&s;tine match, by the arch|bi&s;hop; and the barons of the oppo&s;ition were &s;o much incen&s;ed at the de|fection of Montfort and the earl of Lincoln, who was likewi&s;e bribed by a marriage between his daughter and Richard de Clare, that they began to con|cert mea&s;ures for doing them&s;elves ju&s;tice. The earls of Cornwal and Mare&s;|chal, with almo&s;t all the nobility of England, engaged in a corfederacy again&s;t the foreign mini&s;try and the two de&s;erters of their country's cau&s;e; and the nation in general favoured their undertaking. They a&s;&s;embled in arms at Southwark; and being joined by the citizens of London, loud|ly demanded that Lincoln and Montfort, together with the foreign mi|ni&s;ters,

&s;hould be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the council-board. Henry, terrified at the&s;e proceedings, had recour&s;e to the good offices of the legate, who by the promi&s;e of large grants appea&s;ed the re&s;entment of Richard, earl of Cornwal; and a truce was concluded till the fir&s;t Monday of Lent, when all grievances were to be redre&s;&s;ed at a general council in London. There the barons appeared, at the time appointed: but by this time the earl of Cornwal being bought off, the grievances were but half redre&s;&s;ed; and the di&s;pute was compromi&s;ed by Otho's mediation. The two earls were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the council; and Simon afraid that his marriage would be di&s;&s;olved, by the repre&s;entations of Edmund, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, went privately to Rome, where by dint of money he obtained the pope's confirmation. Then he returned in triumph to England, where he was received with extraordinary marks of favour and affection by Henry, who &s;olemnly inve&s;ted him with the earldom of Leice&s;ter.</P>

<P>The pope's legate, after the accommodation which he effected be|tween the king and the barons, &s;et out on a vi&s;itation towards the north; and taking Oxford in his way, was &s;umptuou&s;ly entertained by the univer&s;ity in the abbey of O&s;iney. After dinner the &s;cholars, coming to pay their re&s;pects to his reverence, were refu&s;ed admittance by his Italian porter, and in&s;ulted in &s;uch a manner that they endeavoured to force their entrance. The legate's &s;ervants ran to &s;u&s;tain the porter, and an ob&s;tinate fray en&s;ued. A poor Iri&s;h &s;cholar, begging at the kitchen grate, was mi&s;erably &s;calded by the &s;teward, who was the legate's own brother; and a Wel&s;hman &s;eeing this outrage, was &s;o incen&s;ed that he &s;hot him dead with an arrow. The legate, terrified at this di&s;turbance, fled to the church, from whence he e&s;caped to Abingdon, where the king re&s;ided, and complained loudly of the unworthy treatment he had received. Henry forthwith &s;ent the earl of Warenne with a party of &s;oldiers to apprehend the rioters; and thirty being taken were committed pri&s;oners to the ca&s;tle of Wallingford. Otho, not yet &s;atisfied, laid the univer&s;ity under an interdict, and excommunicated all tho&s;e who had been concerned in the riot; but at the interce&s;&s;ion of the bi&s;hops tho&s;e cen&s;ures were removed, and the &s;cholars attoned for their pre&s;umption by walking barefoot in proce&s;&s;ion from St. Paul's to the legate's lodgings</P>

<P>In the cour&s;e of this year Peter de Roches, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, dying, Henry recommended William de Valence as his &s;ucce&s;&s;or; but the monks excepted to him as a foreigner odious to the Engli&s;h; and a man who from his want of learning, pa&s;&s;ionate temper, and &s;candalous morals, was altogether unfit for &s;uch a &s;acred function. Yet, in order to manife&s;t their inclination to act agreably to the king's de&s;ire, they pitched upon William de Ralegh and Ralf de Neville, bi&s;hop of Chi$he&s;ter, prelates of unblemi&s;hed characters, and &s;uppo&s;ed acceptable to his maje&s;ty. Henry was &s;o incen&s;ed at their pre&s;uming to di&s;pute his recommendation, that he turned Ralegh out of his &s;eat in coun|cil, deprived Neville of the &s;eals, prevailed upon the pope to annul both elec|tions, and appoint a new prior to the convent, who at la&s;t procured a majority in favour of William de Valence. This martial prelate had gone abroad with Henry de Turbeville, to make a campaign in the emperor's army; but, at<NOTE PLACE="marg">M$t. $span$ Brady.

<P>Henry payed &s;o little regard to the repre&s;entations of his people, that his admini&s;tration was dete&s;ted and his per&s;on de&s;pi&s;ed; and &s;ome indivi|duals, who&s;e affairs were rendered desperate by his tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion, concluded that the death of &s;uch a worthle&s;s prince would be looked upon as a ble&s;&s;ing to the kingdom. On this &s;uppo&s;ition they concerted a plan for de|priving $im of lite, and cho&s;e for their in&s;trument one Ribald, a per&s;on of family and learning. This man went to Wode&s;tock, while Henry re&s;ided at that place, and affecting the behaviour of a lunatic, de&s;ired the king to re&s;ign the crown, which he had u&s;urped from him to whom it of right belonged. When the officers in waiting would have forced him out of the pre&s;ence, and puni&s;hed him for his in&s;olence, Henry forbade them to u&s;e any violence to the poor wretch, who &s;eemed to have lo&s;t his &s;en&s;es; and this compa&s;&s;ion furni&s;hed him with me opportunity of gliding un&s;een into the king's bedchamber, where he lay concealed with a de&s;ign to murther his maje&s;ty. Luckily for Henry, he that night chanced to &s;leep with the queen; and the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, di&s;appoint|ed of h$s prey, ran about the apartments with a long knife in his hand, roaring<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

The guards, being alarmed at his outcries, took him into cu&s;tody, where he confe&s;&s;ed he was in&s;tigated to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the king by William de Marels; and that &s;everal per&s;ons were embarked in the &s;ame con&s;piracy. He was condemned to be hanged, drawn, and quartered; and the &s;entence was executed accordingly, though very little regard &s;eems to have been payed to his information; for none of the accomplices that he named were apprehended, and no &s;teps taken to di&s;cover the particulars of their com|bination. <NOTE PLACE="marg">M.

<P>Such omi&s;&s;ion might indeed have been the effect of Henry's own caprice, which often prompted him to actions equally malicious and ab|&s;urd. This very period produced &s;everal in&s;tances of this nature, which &s;erve to characteri&s;e the genius of this $rivolous monarch. As he had no fixed principles of action, he &s;ometimes heaped favours upon tho&s;e whom he had lately di&s;graced, and frequently in&s;ulted others immediately after he had loaded them with care&s;&s;es. We have already ob&s;erved, that on the death of Richard, earl of Pembroke, he had be&s;towed the inve&s;titure of earl mare&s;chal on that nobleman's brother Gilbert, who&s;e attachment and fidelity ju&s;tified this indul|gence. One day, however, when he repaired to court, according to cu&s;tom, he was denied admittance, and even repul&s;ed with indignity. Not a little &s;urprized at this reception, he complained of the affront to the king, by the interpo&s;ition of a friend: to whom Henry ob&s;erved, that the earl's brother had been a traitor, and even per&s;i&s;ted in his trea&s;on to his la&s;t moment; for which rea&s;on he blamed him&s;elf for having be&s;towed the office of great mare&s;chal upon Gilbert; but, as he had given, &s;o he would take away: a declaration which was no &s;ooner communicated to the earl, than he retired to the north, in order to &s;helter him&s;elf from the de&s;igns of his enemies, who, he &s;uppo&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1239.</NOTE> had prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the king with notions to his prejudice. A few days after he had be&s;towed the earldom of Lei$e&s;ter upon Simon Montfort, he reviled him in the mo&s;t abu&s;ive terms, branding him publicly as a traitor and
<PB N="489" REF="4980">
excommunicated wretch, who had debauched his wife before marriage, and afterwards procured, by bribes, the pope's confirmation. This in&s;ult, offered in pre&s;ence of the counte&s;s, who was his own &s;i&s;ter, alarmed her and her hu&s;band to &s;uch a degree that they immediately retired, and taking &s;hipping in the Thames, were conveyed to the continent, where they remained until Henry's unaccountable anger was appea&s;ed. Nor did Hubert de Burgh e&s;cape another per&s;ecution, from the king's levity or malevolence; tho' that nobleman, far from having given any cau&s;e of offence &s;ince his reconciliation, had almo&s;t &s;olely adhered to Henry in the la&s;t defection of the barons. A new pro|ce&s;s was in&s;tituted again&s;t him for the crimes of which he had been formerly accu&s;ed; and, in a &s;olemn hearing before his peers, he manife&s;ted his inno|cence by the mo&s;t inconte&s;table evidence; neverthele&s;s, he thought proper to &s;acrifice four of his be&s;t ca&s;tles to the rancour of the king, who, thus pacified, dropped the pro&s;ecution. Henry had almo&s;t embroiled him&s;elf with the pope, by &s;ending Ralph de Tuberville with a &s;mall reinforcement to the emperor, who was then at war with that pontiff; and now, from a &s;imilar caprice of di&s;po&s;ition, under&s;tanding that Frederic was &s;olemnly excommunicated by the pope, he, with uncommon eagerne&s;s, ordered the &s;entence to be publi&s;hed in all the churches throughout the kingdom, tho' Frederic was his own brother|in-law, and that alliance would have been a &s;ufficient excu&s;e for declining this publication; at lea&s;t he might have po&s;tponed it &s;o as to have expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome reluctance in complying with Gregory's mandate. Such incon&s;i&s;tency in his conduct was &s;ometimes the effect of his own whim&s;ical gu&s;ts of pa&s;&s;ion; tho' frequently &s;ugge&s;ted by the individuals of a motley mini&s;try, among whom he was continually agitated from error to indi&s;cretion. The&s;e unju&s;t and frantic proceedings had well nigh kindled another flame of civil di&s;turbance, when the indignation of the people was luckily &s;u&s;pended by the birth of his &s;on and heir, who was baptized by the legate, and named Edward, after the con|fe&s;&s;or,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat.

<P>By this time Otho had entirely altered his original conduct, and oppre&s;&s;ed the churches and clergy with &s;uch in&s;atiable avarice, that the bi&s;hops complained to the pope of his exactions; and that pontiff had twice &s;ent letters of revocation to the cardinal, which were as often &s;et a&s;ide, at the de&s;ire of the king, who con&s;idered him as the chief &s;upport of his admini&s;tration. At length the prelates, harra&s;&s;ed and exhau&s;ted by the continual extortions of that legate, a&s;&s;embled in order to concert mea&s;ures for redre&s;&s;ing this grievance; and they had &s;carce begun to deliberate, when Otho entering the convocation, demanded a new &s;ub&s;idy to relieve the pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ities of the holy $ee. The bi&s;hops were &s;o much irritated by this new propo&s;ition, that they told him they were re&s;olved to &s;uffer his tyranny no longer, and broke up in&s;tantly, without giving him time to reply: thus repul&s;ed, he had recour&s;e to the con|vents and religious hou&s;es, which were obliged to furni&s;h what the bi&s;hops had refu&s;ed. After having fleeced the kingdom of large &s;ums, he re&s;olved to fol|low the &s;ame practice in Scotland; and, notwith&s;tanding the caution he had received again&s;t entering that country, he directed his cour&s;e northwards, ac|companied by &s;ome Engli&s;h noblemen, who &s;till re&s;pected his character. When he arrived at the border, he found Alexander waiting, not with a

de&s;ign to conduct him to his court, but re&s;olved to prevent his proceeding farther. Otho, enraged at this oppo&s;ition, threat$ned him with the cen&s;ure of the church; and the Scot &s;et him and his cen&s;ures at defiance: &s;o that an open rupture mu&s;t have en&s;ued, had not the Engli&s;h noblemen interpo&s;ed their good offices, and prevailed upon Alexander to permit the legate to enter his dominions for that time only: yet this favour they could not obtain, until Otho agr$ed to acknowledge, under his hand and &s;eal, that he con&s;idered i$ as a compliment to his own per&s;on, and that it &s;hould not be drawn into a $word$ The difference being thus compromi&s;ed, he accompanied the $in$ $word$ Edinburgh, and found means to extort &s;ome $on$$$butions from the Sco$$$$$ clergy, in &s;pite of all the precautions that could be taken to prevent this ex|erci&s;e of his legatine authority.</P>

<P>While the pope's repre&s;entatives &s;queezed money from the eccle&s;ia&s;tics of England, the laity were plundered by the king's exactions. The pope, and his va&s;&s;al Henry, &s;eemed to vye with each other in pillaging the people; and nothing could have induced the Engli&s;h to &s;uffer &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ion under a king of Henry's contemptible character, but the dread of papal re&s;entment, and the remembrance of tho&s;e mi&s;eries in which civil war had &s;o lately involved the kingdom. The bi&s;hops held another convocation at London, where they pre|&s;ented a remon&s;trance to the king, complaining that he converted the vacant bi&s;hoprics to his own u&s;e, and retarded the elections by rai&s;ing unju&s;t ob&s;tacles, until his own choice was approved by the chapters; nay, they even proceeded &s;o far as to excommunicate tho&s;e who gave him &s;uch pernicious coun&s;el: but he placed &s;uch confidence in the protection of the pope, that very little regard was paid to their repre&s;entatives: he was even &s;o ba&s;e and degenerate as to glory in his dependence on the Roman &s;ee; and when the emperor &s;ent an emba&s;&s;y to expo&s;tulate with him about his having publi&s;hed the &s;entence of excommunica|tion, he replied that he was va&s;&s;al to the pope, who&s;e injunctions he dur&s;t not<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1240.</NOTE> di&s;obey. Mean while the legate, on his return from Scotland, renewed his ar|bitrary exactions, levying con&s;iderable &s;ums from churches and mona&s;teries, un|der the title of Procurations; and at length publi&s;hed a mandate, importing that he had a power not only to ab&s;olve from their vow, &s;uch as had taken the cro&s;s intending to vi&s;it the Holy Land, but al&s;o of compelling them to re|deem them&s;elves with money, on pain of excommunication. The&s;e extortions were countenanced and &s;econded by the pope's own immediate directions. He granted to the abbot and monks of Clugny, a tenth of the profits ari&s;ing from all benefices in England, for the term of three years. But even Henry was a&s;hamed of this impo&s;ition, and forbade the agents to collect it, on pain of incurring &s;evere penalties. His holine&s;s, far from being repul&s;ed by this prohibition, attempted to rai&s;e a fifth of all eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues, as an aid again&s;t the emperor, and accordingly exacted it from the Roman clergy &s;ettled in England, who dur&s;t not refu&s;e it to a power on which they altogether de|pended: it was afterwards propo&s;ed to the prelates, in a council at Reading, and granted by the advice and example of Edmund, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. But, immediately after this tran&s;action, Gregory bargained with the people of Rome for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the emperor, on condition of his providing their children and relations with Engli&s;h benefices; and he &s;ent orders to Edmund, and the bi&s;hops of London and Sarum, to re&s;erve for the Roman clergy three

hundred of the fir&s;t livings that &s;hould fall vacant in England, on pain of being &s;u&s;pended from the power of collating.

<P>Gregory not yet &s;atisfied, contrived another method for &s;punging the Engli&s;h clergy, which was no other than a fraudulent impo&s;ture. He employed Peter Rubens to collect money from one mona&s;tery to another, pretending that certain bi&s;hops and abbots, of whom he had produced a forged li&s;t , had already contributed a part, and others were drawn in by their example. He &s;aid the collection was intended for a particular purpo&s;e, which would be divulged in &s;ix months; and in the mean time he obliged the contributors to &s;wear &s;ecrecy, until the &s;cheme was fully executed. The abbots were no &s;ooner apprized of the deceit, than they complained to Henry, from whom they received no &s;ort of &s;atisfaction, but that of &s;eeing the prelates burdened with the like impo&s;ition. The&s;e the legate convened, in two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ynods, without being able to carry his point, until he tampered with them &s;ingly, and by cajoling care&s;&s;es &s;ecured a majority in favour of the propo&s;ition; then he convoked a &s;ynod at London, where he again propo&s;ed the contribution, which being warmly re|commended by the king, met with the approbation of the whole a&s;&s;embly, and was levied all over England, Ireland, Wales, and Scotland, notwith&s;tanding the truce concluded between the pope and the emperor. Such a contribution was likewi&s;e rai&s;ed in France; but Lewis being informed of the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of ho&s;tilities, and the negotiation for peace, would not allow it to be exported from his kingdom, le$t &s;uch a &s;upply &s;hould render the pope more inflexible and extravagant in his demands. Otho being recalled to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the conferences, departed from England about Chri&s;tmas, and is &s;aid to have carried off more money than was left in the kingdom; tho' neither that nor the French col|lection redounded to the advantage of his holine&s;s; for the two legates were intercepted at &s;ea by the Pi&s;ans, who acting as allies of the emperor, &s;eized the trea&s;ure and impri&s;oned the cardinals. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Angl.

<P>Papal exactions did not cea&s;e at Otho's departure. He left an indu&s;tri|ous &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the per&s;on of Peter de Rubens, who not only gleaned the remains of the contribution, which had not yet been levied, but endeavoured to ob|tain the gift of two prebends and corrodies from the cathedrals and convents, which the pope had formerly &s;olicited without &s;ucce&s;s. He made his fir&s;t at|tack upon the abbey of Peterborough, the example of which, he &s;uppo&s;ed, the re&s;t of the churches would follow. He tried to flatter and intimidate the monks alternately, into compliance; but they evaded his reque&s;t, on pretence of the ab&s;ence of their abbot Walter de S. Edmund, who had been &s;ummoned to the Roman council: and this prelate was no &s;ooner informed of the legate's de&s;ign, than he repre&s;ented to Henry the mi&s;chievous con&s;equences of &s;uch a conce&s;&s;ion, in the &s;tronge&s;t colours; &s;o that the king, as patron, &s;trictly in|hibited the convent from complying with the propo&s;al.

<P>About this period Peter de Savoye, one of the queen's uncles, ar|rived in England, and was received with great honour by Henry, who &s;o|lemnly knighted him in the abbey church of We&s;tmin&s;ter, and made for his entertainment a match at tournament, to be held at Northampton. As Henry's affections were always bia&s;&s;ed to foreigners, he on this occa&s;ion e&s;pou&s;ed their party with uncommon warmth; and that they might win the honours of the day, per&s;uaded a number of his nobility to e&s;pou&s;e their cau&s;e again&s;t Roger Bigod, earl of Norfolk, who engaged to enter the li&s;ts again&s;t Peter de Sa|voye. This ridiculous partiality incen&s;ed the Engli&s;h to &s;uch a degree as had almo&s;t produced a civil war; and both &s;ides were actually drawn up in order of battle, when Henry, convinced of his indi&s;cretion, &s;ent a po&s;itive order to for|bid the tournament. He could not, however, prevent another which was afterwards held at Ware near Hertford, where Gilbert earl mare&s;chal lo&s;t his life by an unruly hor&s;e, Robert de Say was &s;lain, and a good number of people dangerou&s;ly wounded. Henry exhibited convincing proofs of his affection to his queen's uncles, by granting the honour of Richmond to Peter, together with the cu&s;tody of the lands belonging to John earl of Warenne in Suffex and Surrey; and he rai&s;ed his brother Boniface to the archbi&s;hopric of Canterbury. Edmund had before his death excommunicated the monks of Chri&s;t-church, who thwarted him in the choice of a prior; and they had applied to the pope for ab&s;olution from this &s;entence, before they would proceed to a new election. Gregory had impowered the archdeacon of St. Albans, and the prior of Dun|&s;taple, to take off the cen&s;ure; but Simon de Langton, archdeacon of Canter|bury, appealing again&s;t that commi&s;&s;ion as &s;urreptitiou&s;ly obtained, the monks &s;ollicited Henry for his protection; in con&s;ideration of which they promi&s;ed to elect Boniface. The king embraced the propo&s;al, and u&s;ed &s;uch arguments with Langton as induced him to withdraw his appeal: &s;o that Boniface was<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ Dun|$$ple.</NOTE> cho&s;en without oppo&s;ition; tho' he could not be immediately confirmed, on account of the vacancy in the papal chair.</P>

<P>The king found another &s;ubject of triumph in the death of Eleanor of Brittany, the hereditary heire&s;s of the Engli&s;h crown, who had pa&s;&s;ed her days in continual confinement, and now died a virgin in the ca&s;tle of Bri&s;tol. The apprehen&s;ion of her title had been a continual thorn in the &s;ides of king John and his &s;on Henry, who on her account di&s;tru&s;ted the Engli&s;h, and had, in the cour&s;e of the preceding year, obliged all per&s;ons in England, above the age of twelve years, to take an eventual oath of allegiance in favour of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar.

In veneration to the memory of that prince, he rebuilt the church of We&s;tmin&s;ter, at a very great expence; he kept all his fe&s;tivals with the utmo&s;t &s;olemnity; and cau&s;ed a golden &s;hrine of exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip to be made for his relics. The king's extravagance and want of oeconomy were &s;uch as kept him always indigent and rapacious; and the chief bu&s;ine&s;s of his life was to contrive and execute &s;chemes for &s;queez|ing money from his people.

<P>Llewellyn, prince of Wales, dying in a very advanced age, left his principality to his &s;on David, who had made &s;ome petty incur&s;ions into the Engli&s;h territories, and &s;eemed aver&s;e to an accommodation with Henry. He had an illegitimate brother, older than him&s;elf, named Griffin, who was ex|tremely popular among the Wel&s;h; and therefore the object of his jealou&s;y and hatred. He had claimed part of his father's inheritance, to which he was in|titled by the law of the country; but David, in&s;tead of complying with his demand, committed him to clo&s;e pri&s;on. His wife had recour&s;e to Henry, who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;he &s;ollicited, with promi&s;e of paying to him a certain yearly &s;um out of her hu&s;band's e&s;tate. The king, allured by this bait, interpo&s;ed his good offices with David; but the&s;e proving ineffectual, he a&s;&s;embled an army, with which he entered Wales about Mid&s;ummer, when the mar&s;hes were dry and acce&s;&s;ible, and in a few weeks compelled him not only to relea&s;e his brother, but al&s;o to &s;ubmit to &s;uch terms of peace as he thought proper to propo&s;e. At the &s;ame time, dreading &s;ome commotion from the popularity of Griffin, &s;hould he allow him to enjoy his liberty, he committed him clo&s;e pri&s;oner to the Tower of London, where he continued above two years; till at length at|tempting to make his e&s;cape, the rope gave way, where falling down headlong, he da&s;hed his brains out on the ground, and immediately expired. Thus Henry's protection was converted into oppre&s;&s;ion, by the artifice of David, who gratified him with greater advantages than he had &s;tipulated with the un|fortunate Griffin.</P>

<P>While he pro&s;pered in this manner among the mountains of Wales, his brother Richard acquired great reputation for his courage, conduct, and li|berality, in Pale&s;tine, where he fortified A&s;calon, recovered Jeru&s;alem, and made an advantageous truce for ten years with the Saracens. After the&s;e tran|&s;actions he &s;et out on his return to England, and tarried two months at the im|perial court, with his &s;i&s;ter the empre&s;s, who died in childbed immediately after his departure. He had &s;carce arrived in his own country, when he was &s;ollicited by the Poitevins to undertake an expedition into Poitou, and a&s;&s;ert his right to that province. Before his pilgrimage to the Holy Land, he had been &s;olemnly inve&s;ted with the county &s;o called, tho' France po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a good part of it by the conque&s;ts of Philip Augu&s;tus; and the province being thus divided between the two crowns, Lewis thought he had as good a right to be&s;tow the inve&s;titure upon his own brother Alphon&s;o. Henry re&s;olved to revenge this in&s;ult; and engaged in the quarrel with the more eagerne&s;s, as it affected the intere&s;t of his mother, who had by this time e&s;pou&s;ed the count de la Marche, her former lover. As her hu&s;band's territories were in that part of Poitou which was po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by France, he had done homage for them to Lewis: but, when Al|phon&s;o received the inve&s;titure, her pride would not &s;uffer the count to kneel before the French king's brother. Thus animated, he refu&s;ed to take the u&s;ual oath; and that he might be prepared again&s;t the re&s;entment of Lewis, demanded the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Engli&s;h monarch. He repre&s;ented to Henry the facility with which the French might be expelled from Poitou, and a&s;&s;ured
<PB N="494" REF="5030">
him that the province it&s;elf would &s;upply a &s;ufficient number of men for that p$rpo&s;e, provided Henry would defray the expence of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The king f$attered with this hope, convoked a parliament, and demanded a &s;ub&s;idy<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$ Ch 1242.</NOTE> proportioned to the importance of the expedition. But, in&s;tead of complying with his reque&s;t, they reproached him with the di&s;&s;ipation of his revenue, and with the illegal impo&s;itions he had &s;o often laid upon the people; they loudly complained of his breach of promi&s;e with regard to the charters of liberties, which he had &s;o often &s;worn to maintain; and ob&s;erving that the truce with France was not yet expired, plainly told him he had nothing further to ex|$$ct<NOTE PLACE="marg">M$$. $word$ $word$ Carte.</NOTE> from their compliance. Neverthele&s;s, he practi&s;ed the method of cajoling the members in private, which had already &s;ucceeded on two or three different occa&s;ions; and prevailed upon a good number of individuals to contribute their intere&s;t towards the gratification of his de&s;ire. By the&s;e means a majority was &s;ecured; and they granted him a thirtieth of all moveables, for the &s;er|vice of this undertaking. But this fund being in&s;ufficient, he levied a talliage on the cities, burroughs, and crown deme&s;nes in Ireland, and demanded an aid from the clergy of that kingdom. Thus &s;upplied with money, he &s;um|moned all his military tenants to meet him with hor&s;es and arms at Win|che&s;ter, on the twenty-&s;eventh day of April; and in the mean time agreed to a match between his daughter Margaret, and Alexander, &s;on to the king of Scotland, who, in con&s;equence of this contract, undertook to pre&s;erve the peace in the northern parts of England. William, archbi&s;hop of York, was appointed guardian of the realm, a council a&s;&s;igned to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the admini|&s;tration; and Henry &s;etting &s;ail from Port&s;mouth with his queen, his brother Richard, &s;even earls, three hundred knights, and thirty hog&s;heads of &s;ilver,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$$.

<DIV4 N="57" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; LVII.</HEAD>
<P>To oppo&s;e this formidable armament, the French king had fitted out a fleet of eighty galleys, at Rochelle; and a&s;&s;embled an army of four thou|&s;and knights, and five times that number of gentlemen and bowmen, be&s;ides a va&s;t multitude of infantry. With the&s;e he invaded Poitou, where he reduced &s;everal places belonging to the count de la Marche; and at length inve&s;ted Fontenay, which after an ob&s;tinate defence was obliged to &s;urrender at di&s;cre|tion. He was employed in the &s;iege, when Henry landing at Royane, &s;ent emba&s;&s;adors to demand &s;atisfaction for attacking the count de la Marche, whom he repre&s;ented as the ally of England. Lewis replied that he was willing to re|new the truce with the Engli&s;h king upon rea&s;onable terms; but that Henry had no bu&s;ine&s;s to interpo&s;e between him and his rebellious &s;ubjects. This &s;en|&s;ible an&s;wer being con&s;trued into a refu&s;al, was followed by a formal declaration of war; and Henry advanced to Pons, where he was joined by the nobles of Ga&s;cony, tho' he was very much di&s;appointed in the number of tho&s;e auxili|aries. Th$n he marched to Saintes, where he remained about a fortnight in hope of further reinforcements; and afterwards made a motion to Toney on the Charente, with a view to interrupt the progre&s;s of Lewis, who had by this time taken almo&s;t all the ca&s;tles belonging to the count de la Marche. Here Henry engaged in a treaty with Geffrey de Rancone, lord of Taillebourg, in the neig$bourhood of which he took po&s;t, and had it in his power to &s;e|cure $word$ town and ca&s;tle, and break down the bridge, &s;o as to prevent the Fren$$ king from pa&s;&s;ing the river. But the count de la Marche, and Re|naud
<PB N="495" REF="5040">
de Pons, by who&s;e direction he acted, di&s;&s;uaded him from taking the&s;e precautions, which could not fail to di&s;oblige Geffrey, on who&s;e honour they told him he might depend with the mo&s;t perfect reliance: he therefore retired to Saintes; but hearing of the French king's approach, advanced again to Taillebourg, which he found already occupied by Lewis, who was likewi&s;e joined by Geffrey. As the Engli&s;h army was greatly inferior in number to that of the French king, Henry retreated with precipitation to Saintes; and Lewis pa&s;&s;ing the river, attacked his rear with &s;uch fury and expedition, that after an ob&s;tinate engagement, the Engli&s;h gave way, having &s;u&s;tained a con|&s;iderable lo&s;s. They were pur&s;ued to the neighbourhood of Saintes, where the count de la Marche making a &s;ally to cover their retreat, the earls of Cornwal, Norfolk, Sarum, and Leice&s;ter, rallied their forces, and another battle en|&s;ued, which was fought on both &s;ides with equal bravery and &s;ucce&s;s. But Henry's army being greatly dimini&s;hed, he quitted Saintes immediately, and made a ha&s;ty march to Pons, where leaving a good garri&s;on, he proceeded to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. Paris.

<P>The count de la Marche was confounded and di&s;mayed at the ex|traordinary &s;ucce&s;s of Lewis. He plainly perceived how little he could tru&s;t to the protection of the Engli&s;h king; and therefore re&s;olved to take other mea|&s;ures for his own &s;afety. He &s;ent his elde&s;t &s;on to &s;ue for &s;ome tolerable con|ditions of peace; and he met with &s;uch a favourable reception from Lewis, that he him&s;elf, and his family, repaired to the French camp, and &s;urrendered them|&s;elves at di&s;cretion. The French king generou&s;ly pardoned the count, of whom he exacted nothing but three of his ca&s;tles, which he kept as pledges of his promi&s;ed fidelity. In all probability he would have pur&s;ued his &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t the king of England, had not the plague broke out in his army, and him&s;elf been attacked by a langui&s;hing di&s;order that obliged him to de&s;i&s;t. Perhaps the&s;e rea&s;ons were reinforced by &s;ome &s;cruples of con&s;cience he had expre&s;&s;ed touching the oath which his father took to re&s;tore the dominions on the continent, that formerly belonged to the kings of England: be that as it will, he con&s;ented to a truce for five years, after having completed the conque&s;t of Poitou. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ryme$.</NOTE></P>

<P>Henry had by this time &s;een him&s;elf for&s;aken, and indeed betrayed, by almo&s;t all the Poitevins, on who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance and adherence he depended. He was in great danger of being be&s;ieged in Blaye, but now he was &s;afe in<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 124$.</NOTE> Bourdeaux, where he &s;pent the winter among the Ga&s;coigne nobility, in fea&s;t|ing and riot, which, with the large&s;&s;es he made to tho&s;e Ga&s;cons, &s;oon ex|hau&s;ted his finances; &s;o that he was obliged to write for a &s;upply to the arch|bi&s;hop of York, who received orders at the &s;ame time to confi&s;cate the e&s;tates of &s;ome noblemen who had returned to England without his permi&s;&s;ion. The regent complied with his in&s;tructions &s;o far as they regarded a remittance of money, which was immediately di&s;patched; but, he would not obey the other part of his orders, for fear of exciting a di&s;turbance in the kingdom. By that time the money arrived at Bourdeaux, it was all anticipated, and Henry directed the archbi&s;hop to demand a year's wool of the Ci&s;tercians; which they ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to grant; and the regent unwilling to u&s;e compul&s;ion, ob|tained a con&s;iderable &s;ub&s;idy from the parliament, in order to di&s;engage the $$$g entirely from the debts he had contracted. This was likewi&s;e mi&s;applied,
<PB N="496" REF="5050">
and the archbi&s;hop pre&s;&s;ed to u&s;e other expedients. He then attempted to bor|row money in the king's name from wealthy individuals; but this odious practice produced &s;uch di&s;content and clamour, that he gave the king to un|der&s;tand all re&s;ources were &s;topped, and that there was an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for his immediate return. Henry reduced to the&s;e circum&s;tances, re&s;olved in good earne&s;t to quit Bourdeaux, and ordered all the noblemen in England to a&s;|&s;emble at Port&s;mouth for his reception. Then he ratified the &s;hameful truce with France, $y which he bound him&s;elf to pay five thou&s;and pounds a year to Lewis; and, at his arrival in England, gave directions for a magnificent entry into London, as if he had returned from conque&s;t.</P>

<P>Before he embarked in this expedition, he had projected a match be|tween his brother Richard, and Sanchia, third daughter of the count de Pro|vence; and tho' this alliance was generally di&s;liked by the Engli&s;h, who fore|&s;aw it would &s;trengthen the intere&s;t of the Proven&s;als in England, where it was already too powerful, the contract was adju&s;ted, and the young lady ar|riving under the au&s;pices of her mother, the nuptials were pompou&s;ly &s;olem|nized at We&s;tmin&s;ter. The earldom of Cornwal, with the honours of Eye and Wallingford, were confirmed to Richard, with a grant of five hundred pounds yearly to him and his heirs by this marriage: and after the rejoicings on this occa&s;ion, the old counte&s;s returned to her own country, with four thou&s;and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>Henry was now more nece&s;&s;itous than ever: he was immer&s;ed in debt, and &s;o low in credit that he found it impracticable to borrow money for his mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ions. Reduced to this contemptible &s;ituation, he i&s;&s;ued writs directing his &s;heriffs to enquire into mi&s;demeanours and tre&s;pa&s;&s;es again&s;t the law, by widows and others who had married without a licence, and en|croachments upon royal fore&s;ts; and con&s;iderable &s;ums were rai&s;ed from the fines produced by this enquiry. In order to cha&s;ti&s;e the Ci&s;tercians and Pre|mon&s;trants, who had refu&s;ed him one year's wool, he forbade the exportation of that commodity; and this prohibition continued in force till they thought proper to comply with his demand. He extorted the &s;ub&s;tance of the Jews with &s;uch &s;everity, that one Aaron of York was compelled to pay four marks of gold, and as many thou&s;ands of &s;ilver. As a great many of the Norman noblemen enjoyed e&s;tates in England, he, in imitation of the French king, gave them to under&s;tand that they mu&s;t either become entirely French or Eng|li&s;h, and confi&s;cated the e&s;tates of tho&s;e who pre&s;erved their allegiance to<NOTE PLACE="marg">M$$.

<P>Yet all the&s;e expedients proved in&s;ufficient to relieve his wants, and &s;upply his extravagance; and he re&s;olved once more to &s;ollicit a &s;upply from parliament, which, tho' always aver&s;e to him in the beginning of every &s;e&s;&s;ion, he generally found means to convert to his purpo&s;e by promi&s;es of re|formation. At pre&s;ent he was furni&s;hed with a pretence by the king of Navarre, who had invaded Ga&s;cony, and &s;ome incur&s;ions of the Wel&s;h. The barons being a&s;&s;embled at We&s;tmin&s;ter, he him&s;elf made the motion for a &s;ub&s;idy, which was heard with manife&s;t &s;igns of di&s;content. The prelates and the laity retiring &s;eparately, re&s;olved that no grant &s;hould be made without their com|mon con&s;ent; and that a committee of twelve per&s;ons &s;hould be cho&s;en to con|&s;ider of proper mea&s;ures to prevent all encroachments on the two charters. They
<PB N="497" REF="5060">
complained that writs had been i&s;&s;ued out of chancery to the prejudice of their liberties; de&s;ired that they might have the nomination of the chancellor and ju&s;ticiary; propo&s;ed that four noblemen of the king's council &s;hould be ap|pointed con&s;ervators of the liberty of the kingdom, with power to in&s;pect the trea&s;ury, and the application of the public's money; to &s;ummon a parliament as often as nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould require; and arbitrate in all differences between the king and his &s;ubjects. They demanded that all writs contrary to the cu&s;tom of the realm &s;hould be revoked; that cen&s;ures &s;hould be publi&s;hed again&s;t all that oppo&s;ed the&s;e regulations; that the chancellor and ju&s;ticiary, cho&s;en by con&s;ent of parliament, &s;hould always be two of the four con&s;ervators; that in ca&s;e the king &s;hould deprive the chancellor of the &s;eals, all writs &s;igned by his &s;ucce&s;&s;or &s;hould be null; that be&s;ides the chancellor and ju&s;ticiary, the parlia|ment &s;hould nominate two judges in the common pleas, two barons in the exchequer, and a ju&s;tice of the Jews; and that all &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons &s;hould be removed from about the king's per&s;on. Henry was extremely alarmed at the nature of the&s;e demands, which did not at all &s;uit with his high notions of the prerogative. He was incen&s;ed at the pre&s;umption of his va&s;&s;als; but &s;uch was his character and &s;ituation, that he dur&s;t not avow his re&s;entment. He therefore evaded their propo&s;als with general promi&s;es of amendment, which he had no intention to perform; and after having tampered in vain with the mem|bers, thought proper to prorogue the parliament.</P>

<P>During this &s;e&s;&s;ion, one Martin was &s;ent over, as nuncio from pope Innocent, the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Gregory, to procure an aid of ten thou&s;and marks from the clergy, to maintain the war again&s;t the emperor, who at the &s;ame time di&s;patched emba&s;&s;adors to England, to ju&s;tify his own conduct, and remon&s;trate again&s;t the demand of Innocent. The nation was &s;o harra&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e harpies, that they were glad of any pretence for denying his reque&s;t; and this they were furni&s;hed with by the king; who forbade the prelates to lay im|po&s;ts on the fees, which they held of the crown, to the detriment of his &s;ervice. Martin, though baffled in this attempt, did not fail to exerci&s;e his legatine autho|rity with equal tyranny and &s;ucce&s;s; he exacted the arrears of a tenth of eccle|&s;ia&s;tical benefices, granted for the relief of the Holy-Land, as well as of the contributions for the &s;upport of the late pope Gregory; he laid grievous im|po&s;itions on the prelates and religious hou&s;es; &s;eized all the vacant benefices for the u&s;e of Innocent's chaplains and relations, and behaved with &s;uch de&s;|poti&s;m of eccle&s;ia&s;tical in&s;olence and tyranny, that the Engli&s;h began to harbour the thoughts of freeing them&s;elves entirely from the papal yoke.

This officer was immediately routed by David, who had the preceding day defeated a body of troops, commanded by the earl of Hereford and Ralph de Mortimer. The prince of Wales never doubted that Henry would employ all his forces again&s;t<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Tho' this propo&s;al was extremely agreeable to Innocent, he refu&s;ed to give a determinate an&s;wer, until he &s;hould have enquired into the merits of the cau&s;e, and in particular examined whether or not the la&s;t treaty between Henry and David was the effect of compul&s;ion, as the prince of Wales had alledged. For this purpo&s;e, he &s;ent a commi&s;&s;ion to two Wel&s;h abbots to &s;et on foot an en|quiry touching this pretended con&s;traint; and in ca&s;e it &s;hould &s;hould appear th$t David acted upon compul&s;ion, they were ve&s;ted with power to ab&s;olve him of his oath and annul the treaty. The two eccle&s;ia&s;tics, elated with this de|l$g$tion of papal authority, &s;ummoned the king of England to appear before them as if he had been a &s;imple villager, &s;ubject to their juri&s;diction; an exam|ple of infolence as which Henry and his &s;ubjects were equally incen&s;ed. And<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> now he heartily repented of having di&s;banded his army. Mean while he ordered $word$ to be levied, &s;o as to be in a condition to act in the &s;pring, and &s;um|mo$$d David, with all the nobility in North and South Wales, to appear in the king's court at We&s;tmin&s;ter on the fir&s;t Thur&s;day of Lent, there to do ho|mage<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> and an&s;wer for their depredations. David, alarmed at the &s;pirit of Henry and his council, who began to prepare for this inva&s;ion with uncommon vi|gour, and even &s;ent for a body of troops from Ireland, endeavoured to amu&s;e the king with a negotiation, which produced no effect. A great council was a&s;&s;embled at Whitfuntide, in which it was re&s;olved that his maje&s;ty &s;hould command the army in per&s;on. The military tenants of the crown were &s;um|moned to appear at a certain rendezvous, and about the middle of Augu&s;t, he began his march for North Wales, through which he penetrated with|out oppo&s;ition to the river Conway, where he built the &s;trong ca&s;tle of Garinac, to overawe the Wel&s;h and intercept their parties that &s;hould attempt to make incur&s;ions into the Engli&s;h territory. This fort effectually an|&s;wered all the purpo&s;es for which it was intended, and hampered the enemy &s;o much that they could draw no &s;upplies from Che&s;hire, while the troops from Ireland wa&s;ted the i&s;le of Angle&s;ey; and proclamation was made in all the marches, that no provi&s;ion or merchandize &s;hould be carried into Wales under &s;evere penalties; &s;o that tho&s;e ancient Britons were cooped up in the mountainous counties of Caernarvon and Merioneth, and reduced to a &s;tarving

Thus they continued till the death of prince David, which hap|pened in the beginning of the next year; and as he left no i&s;&s;ue the principa|lity ought to have devolved to his nephew Roger de Mortimer; but the Wel&s;h would not &s;ubmit to the government of an Engli&s;hman, again&s;t whom they &s;et up Llewellyn and David Goch, the two &s;ons of Griffin.

<P>The Wel&s;h expedition being happily terminated, the nobility of England conferred together upon the tyranny of Rome, which was become altogether in&s;upportable in the exactions of the nuncio Martin. They were mortified to &s;ee all the wealth of the nation exported to gratify the pope's ava|rice and ambition; and perceiving how the clergy always &s;uffered them&s;elves to be mollified by the artifice and eloquence of the legates, re&s;olved to exert them|&s;elves in putting a &s;top to &s;uch &s;candalous impo&s;ition. Without waiting for the protection of the king, upon which they could &s;o little depend, they, of their own authority, ordered the governors of ports to apprehend all tho&s;e who &s;hould bring bulls and mandates into the kingdom; and this order was &s;o well obeyed, that in a very little time a courier was arre&s;ted in his way to the nuncio, loaded with the&s;e commi&s;&s;ions, impowering him to levy money on divers pre|tences. The nuncio loudly complained of this violence and in&s;ult, to the king, who ordered the papers to be re&s;tored; but the nobility made &s;trong remon|&s;trances on the &s;ubject, and, in order to convince him of the prejudice done to his own &s;ubjects by favouring the papal innovations, pre&s;ented him with a &s;che|dule of the benefices enjoyed in England by Italian eccle&s;ia&s;tics; which exceeded the ordinary revenues of the crown. Henry was &s;upri&s;ed at this information, but as he would not, of his own authority, venture to reform the abu&s;e, for fear of incurring the pope's re&s;entment, he permitted the noblemen to &s;end amba&s;&s;a|dors in the name of the whole nation to the council at Lyon, with letters containing tho&s;e grievances, and demanding immediate redre&s;s. Mean while, as they knew how dextrou&s;ly the court of Rome invented delays and &s;ubter|fuges, they determined to do them&s;elves ju&s;tice; and a&s;&s;embling on pretence of a tournament, &s;ent a knight in their name to the nuncio, with a peremptory order to quit the kingdom without delay. Martin a&s;ked by who&s;e authority he brought &s;uch an in&s;olent me&s;&s;age; and he replied by the authority of the whole nation, giving him to under&s;tand, that if in three days he &s;hould &s;till be found in England, he mu&s;t expect to be hewn in pieces. The nuncio forth|with carried his complaints to the king; but finding Henry unable to protect him again&s;t his enemies, demanded a pa&s;&s;port and departed immediately, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction of the people. The pope was &s;o incen&s;ed at this affront that he could not help exclaiming, "I &s;ee plainly I mu&s;t make peace with the emperor, in order to humble tho&s;e petty princes; for the great dragon being once appea&s;ed, we &s;hall find no difficulty in cru&s;hing tho&s;e &s;maller &s;erpents."</P>

Poweric, an eccle&s;ia&s;tic, deputed by the nobility, arrived at Lyon, and pre|&s;ented their letter to the council, in which the pope him&s;elf pre&s;ided. The contents, which were publicly read, confounded his holine&s;s to &s;uch a degree t$$t he did not an&s;wer one word: and one of the amba&s;&s;adors, after having waited &s;ome time for his reply, began to explain more at large the grievances of the Engli&s;h nation. He complained of the tribute which John had engaged to pay to the pope, as an impo&s;ition which that prince had no right $$ lay up|on his people; and maintained that neither he nor any king of England could render his kingdom tributary, without the con&s;ent of his barons; and there|fore his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the &s;ee of Rome was null and void. He bitterly inveighed again&s;t the clau&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For example, when the pope di&s;po&s;ed of a be|nef$ce, he in&s;erted in his bull, `Notwith&s;tanding the right of patronage or other contrary privileges;' a clau&s;e which effectually de&s;troyed the rights of patronage ve&s;ted in bi&s;hops, abbots, convents, and lay patrons of benefices.</NOTE> Non Ob&s;tante in&s;erted by the pope in all his bulls, which en|tirely de&s;troyed the rights of patronage and all the privileges of the Anglicane church; and lastly, he expatiated upon the extortion of nuncios and legates, and in general on all the &s;pecies of papal tyranny which had lately been ex|ercised over the Engli&s;h nation. All the an&s;wer they received to the remon|$tr$nce was the pope's general promi&s;e to take their complaints into con&s;ideration; and finding his aim was to amu&s;e them with eva&s;ive excu&s;es, they prote&s;ted again&s;t the tribute, and returned to their own country. Immediately after their departure, Innocent, in order to fa&s;cinate the eyes of the council, upon which the complaints of the Engli&s;h had made &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion, declared that he would immediately reform tho&s;e abu&s;es; and publi&s;hed two bulls in favour of the Engli&s;h nation: the fir&s;t permitted patrons to enjoy the right of pre&s;en|tation; and the other implied that when an Italian incumbent &s;hould die, his benefice might be granted to a native. But with re&s;pect to the tribute, far from relinqui&s;hing that claim, he wrote menacing letters to the Engli&s;h pre|lates, expre&s;sly enjoining them to confirm and &s;ub&s;cribe the charter by which John acknowleged him&s;elf as a va&s;&s;al and tributary to the holy &s;ee. How|&s;oever the bi&s;hops were &s;hocked at this demand, they were intimidated into compliance by the threats of eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ure; though Henry him&s;elf<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr. D$n&s;t.

<P>Innocent, being exa&s;perated at the remon&s;trance of the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;adors, and the refractory behaviour of Henry, endeavoured to per&s;uade the king of France, during an interview at Cluny, to expel that prince from his dominions, or at lea&s;t reduce him to an ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the papal autho|rity. But Lewis excu&s;ed him&s;elf from engaging in &s;uch an undertaking, con|trary to the terms of his truce with England, his affinity with Henry, and the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

He, in his turn, pre&s;&s;ed the pope to a reconci|liation with the emperor; which that pontiff declined, and afterwards hired russians to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate Frederic, after having endeavoured to dethrone him, by rai&s;ing up a competitor in the per&s;on of Henry, landgrave of Thuringia, and rai&s;ed contributions to maintain his title as if it had been a war of religion. The Engli&s;h nation was, by this time, extremely irritated again&s;t the pope, who &s;eemed to de&s;pi&s;e their re&s;entment, and proceeded in his exactions with

redoubled vigour. He demanded of the Engli&s;h prelates, a number of knights to &s;erve in the army of the church a whole year at their own expence; and, by his &s;ole authority, granted the profits of all vacant benefices within the province of Canterbury, for one year to archbi&s;hop Boniface. He levied the &s;ix thou&s;and marks a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed on the prelates by his nuncio; the twentieth of all eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues, according to a decree of the council at Lyon; one third of the income of all benefices, exceeding the yearly rent of one hundred marks, and a mo$ety of the prebends and livings of non-re&s;ident canons and clergymen; exactions which, according to computation, amounted to eighty thou&s;and marks, a &s;um thought equivalent to the whole &s;pecie of the kingdom, and this to be exported for three years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Carte.</NOTE></P>

<P>A parliament meeting in Mid-lent at London, the&s;e grievances were taken into con&s;ideration; and, as they would not yet lay a&s;ide all re&s;pect for the pope, they re&s;olved to renew their complaints at the court of Rome, to which three letters of expo&s;tulation were immediately &s;ent by the king, the pre|lates, and the barons; and the&s;e were committed to the charge of William de Powick, and Henry de la Mare, who had in&s;tructions to &s;econd them with per|&s;onal remon&s;trances. Mean while, Innocent &s;eemed to be tran&s;ported with the de&s;ire of driving the Engli&s;h to de&s;pair. He claimed the per&s;onal e&s;tates of ec|cle&s;ia&s;tics who died inte&s;tate, all goods fraudulently acquired, provided the right owner did not appear, all effects ama&s;&s;ed by u&s;ury, and all legacies granted for re&s;titution and pious u&s;es. He appointed the Dominicans his commi&s;&s;ioners for levying the&s;e exactions, which the king him&s;elf had not power to prevent. He had ventured to prohibit the levy of the &s;ix thou&s;and marks, and the payment of any talliage or contribution to the pope, till the return of the agents: but, notwith&s;tanding this order, it was collected by &s;everal bi&s;hops, whom the pope had charged to excommunicate all recu&s;ants. At length the deputies returned; and, in a parliament held at Winche&s;ter, made &s;uch a report of their emba&s;&s;y, as plainly proved how little they were to expect from negotiation. Innocent had treated their envoys with contempt; and, in&s;tead of redre&s;&s;ing their grie|vances, declared that he would proceed to the &s;ame cen&s;ures with the king of England, which he had inflicted upon the emperor. The a&s;&s;embly, fired with indignation at the&s;e menaces, per&s;uaded the king to renew the prohibition under the mo&s;t &s;evere penalties; and this exa&s;perated the pope, in his turn, to &s;uch a degree, that he forthwith di&s;patched an order to W. de Canteloup, bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, to take mea&s;ures for the payment of the contribution-money to his nuncio, at the new temple, before a certain day, on pain of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion and ex|communication. Henry at fir&s;t appeared re&s;olute to maintain the liberties of the nation; but his courage was not proof again&s;t the menaces of this prelate and other bi&s;hops, who threatened the kingdom with an interdict; while his own brother Richard e&s;pou&s;ed, in a very in&s;olent and indecent manner, the in|tere&s;t of his holine&s;s, who had &s;ecured his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, by a grant of the money ari&s;ing from the commutation of vows made to engage in the cru&s;ade. The&s;e con&s;iderations were powerful enough to have &s;taggered the re&s;olution of a more courageous prince than Henry, who was therefore obliged to &s;ubmit; and the people were delivered over as a prey to the in&s;olence and rapine of a Roman pontiff. In vain did the abbots and clergy complain of the&s;e extortions, to the next parliament. There was not &s;ufficient vigour left among the barons, to

with&s;tand the faction of the pope, and the intere&s;t of Richard, who acted as his abettor; and all they could do in their own behalf, was to di&s;patch new agents with a &s;econd remon&s;trance to Innocent, declaring it impo&s;&s;ible for the kingdom<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch. 1247.

<P>Not but that Innocent relaxed in &s;ome trifles, with a &s;hew of mode|ration, which was, in all probability, owing to the unfavourable po&s;ture of his affairs. The landgrave of Thuringia, in &s;upport of who&s;e preten&s;ions he had expended above fifty thou&s;and pounds, was routed in a pitched battle, the lo&s;s of which he did not long &s;urvive. But this triumph of Frederic &s;eemed to in|crea&s;e the rancour of his holine&s;s, who now re&s;olved to &s;et up another competi|tor again&s;t him, in the per&s;on of William, count of Holland. In order to defray the expence of this new project, he &s;ent four legates into different coun|tries to rai&s;e contributions; and di&s;patched two fran&s;ci&s;can friars into England, where they did not pretend to u&s;e compul&s;ion, but obtained a licence from the king to beg as mendicants, for the pope's occa&s;ions. They had no &s;ooner gained this point, than they a&s;&s;umed powers of a very different nature; and &s;ent circu|lar letters to bi&s;hops, abbots, and mona&s;teries, demanding exorbitant &s;ums; which, however, the prelates refu&s;ed to pay, without the approbation of parlia|ment. The pope, incen&s;ed at their refu&s;al, &s;ent over one of his chaplains, called Marino, to enforce the demand by dint of legatine authority, from which the bi&s;hops appealed both to the pope and parliament; but, meeting with redre&s;s from neither, they and the mona&s;teries were fain to compound for a large &s;um of money. The forbearance of the Engli&s;h, under &s;uch grievous oppre&s;|&s;ion, appears amazing to tho&s;e who do not con&s;ider the &s;uper&s;tition of the times, and the mi&s;eries of a civil war, which were &s;till fre&s;h in the remembrance of the nation. Henry was a prince of &s;uch contemptible talents, that the &s;ub|jects would run no ri&s;que in his behalf, from any per&s;onal attachment to him or his family; and it was equally di&s;agreeable to them whether they &s;hould be<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>This impolitic monarch &s;till continued to exhibit marks of his odious partiality to foreigners. Peter de Savoye, earl of Richmond, arriving from Provence, with &s;ome maidens of that country, whom he brought over to be matched among the Engli&s;h nobility, two of them were immediately di&s;|po&s;ed in marriage to the king's wards, Edmund de Lacy, earl of Lincoln, and Richard de Burgh; and Peter him&s;elf was gratified with a grant of all the ho|nour of Aquila in Su&s;&s;ex. Henry's three uterine brothers, called Guy de Lu|&s;ignan, William and Aymer de Valence, arrived about the &s;ame time with their &s;i&s;ter Alice, to profit by the king's bounty. The fir&s;t received a con&s;i$er|able &s;um of money, with which he returned to his own country. William was knighted, and indulged with a grant of the honour of Hertford; Aymer being in orders, was provided with &s;everal wealthy benefices, and afterwards elected bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter; and Alice was married to the young earl of Warenne. The&s;e &s;trangers were followed by Beatr$x, counte&s;s of Provence, now a widow, and her brother Thomas, late count of Flanders, and were received with open arms by Henry, though he him&s;elf was unable to defray the ordinary expence of his hou&s;|hold.<NOTE PLACE="marg">T$rrel.</NOTE> For want of ready money, he was fain to plunder foreign merchants, as $word$ as his own &s;ubjects, of &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries and provi&s;ions as he wanted; and

his brother Richard took the advantage of his di&s;tre&s;s. The coin had been di|mini&s;hed one third in its value, by the villainy of Jews and Flemings, who traded in England for wool; and as this evil required an immediate remedy, people were forbidden to take damaged money, and ordered to bring it to the king's mint, where it &s;hould be changed. Richard knowing the profits of a re|coinage were very con&s;iderable, took this opportunity of demanding the pay|ment of a &s;um which he had lent to the king upon u&s;ury, and importuned him &s;o much, that in order to quiet his clamour, Henry be&s;towed upon him a grant for &s;even years, of the farm of the mint for a third part of the profits.</P>

<P>The&s;e large&s;&s;es and alienations reduced him to &s;uch indigence, that he was obliged to have recour&s;e again to his parliament, which had met in February at We&s;tmin&s;ter: but, when he demanded a &s;upply, they re|proached him with his profu&s;ion to foreigners and want of oeconomy, and ab|&s;olutely refu&s;ed to relieve his nece&s;&s;ities. They complained of his retaining vacant benefices in his own hands, di&s;couraging commerce by clogging it with heavy duties, and conferring the fir&s;t po&s;ts of the kingdom upon per&s;ons void of talents and integrity. They therefore in&s;i&s;ted upon the &s;ame demands which they had made in a former &s;e&s;&s;ion, touching the nomination of a chancellor and ju&s;ticiaries; and the king, perceiving from their complexion that they were not in a complying humour, prorogued them immediately, that he might prepare him&s;elf for their next a&s;&s;ault. During this interval, in&s;tead of taking popular mea&s;ures to appea&s;e the re&s;entment of the barons, he &s;eemed to attach him&s;elf more &s;trongly than ever to his foreign favourites, and doubtle&s;s by their advice, attempted to intimidate the parliament at their next meeting. He inveighed again&s;t them for endeavouring to impo&s;e laws upon him, which they them&s;elves would never endure: he ob&s;erved that every ma&s;ter of a pri|vate family cho&s;e his own confidants and coun&s;ellors, and retained or di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed his dome&s;tics at his own plea&s;ure; whereas he, though a king, was treated like a &s;lave by his own &s;ubjects: but, far from changing his officers according to their capricious humour, he was determined to be ma&s;ter in his own kingdom, and to teach them it was their province to obey. Then he pro|mi&s;ed, in general terms, to redre&s;s the grievances of the nation; and concluded with demanding an immediate &s;ub&s;idy, that might enable him, at the expiration of the truce, to recover the dominions on the continent which his ance&s;tors po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed. The barons, piqued at this &s;tately declaration, replied in the &s;ame &s;train, that, &s;eeing he was not di&s;po&s;ed to reform his conduct, they &s;hould not be &s;o indi&s;crect as to impoveri&s;h them&s;elves, to feed the avarice of foreigners, under the notion of imaginary conque&s;ts. From this an&s;wer Henry, de&s;pair|ing of obtaining &s;uccour from this quarter, di&s;&s;olved them immediately, le&s;t they &s;hould proceed to more di&s;agreeable re&s;olutions; and his coffers being quite exhau&s;ted, was fain to &s;ell his plate and jewels, which immediately found pur|cha&s;ers among the citizens of London: a circum&s;tance that mortified him ex|tremely, as they had &s;o often pleaded poverty whenever he demanded a &s;upply. He re&s;olved to manife&s;t his re&s;entment, by e&s;tabli&s;hing a new fair at We&s;tmin|&s;ter, during which he prohibited all trade in London; and, in&s;tead of regard|ing the repre&s;entations of the merchants on this &s;ubject, he pa&s;&s;ed the Chri&s;tmas holidays in their city, that he might have an opportunity to exact an exorbi|tant new-year's gift, which neverthele&s;s did not excu&s;e them from further impo|&s;ition;

<P>The fa&s;hion of taking the cro&s;s was &s;o prevalent at this junc|ture, that Henry him&s;elf, in the mid&s;t of all his nece&s;&s;ities, profe&s;&s;ed himself a &s;oldier of Chri&s;t: though, in all probability, this &s;tep was the effect of &s;ome<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$. Ch. 1250.</NOTE> other motive more cogent than his religion. Perhaps he &s;aw no other pro&s;pect of paying his debts, which were by this time become very burthen&s;ome and di&s;|graceful, than that of obtaining a &s;ub&s;idy on pretence of equipping an arma|ment for Pale&s;tine: or el&s;e he was de&s;irous of putting him&s;elf under the pope's protection, which he thought would &s;creen him from the de&s;igns that might be hatched to his prejudice. He &s;eemed to &s;u&s;pect &s;omething of this kind, from the ambition of his brother Richard, who had made a my&s;terious journey to Rome, accompanied by the earl of Glouce&s;ter, and &s;everal noblemen and prelates. He had been care&s;&s;ed by the pope at Lyon, who admitted him to several private conferences, the &s;ubject of which afforded great &s;peculation; and, as he had always been the chief of the malecontents, Henry might very naturally &s;u&s;pect him of &s;ome de&s;ign to his prejudice. When Henry took the cro&s;s, his example was followed by five hundred knights, &s;ome of whom had &s;old their e&s;tates to defray the expence of their voyage; and they expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t impatience to &s;et out upon the expedition: but as the king was not yet in a condition to perform his vow, he forbad them to cro&s;s the &s;ea, until he him&s;elf &s;hould depart; and this prohibition was, at his de&s;ire, confirmed by the pope. At the &s;ame time, his holine&s;s indulged him with the grant of a tenth of all eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues in England and Ireland for three years, to be levied and de&s;po&s;ited until the king &s;hould &s;et out upon his voyage. Henry endeavoured to &s;ave money, by retrenching the expences of his hou&s;hold: he &s;et on foot an inqui&s;ition into tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to examine into e&s;cheats and alienations of the crown-deme&s;nes, with a view to rai&s;e &s;ums by fines and re&s;umptions; and laid a talliage upon the Jews, who never failed<NOTE PLACE="marg">M.

Henry de Bathe, one of the judges, was amerced in a con&s;iderable &s;um, on pretence of his having allowed a criminal to e&s;cape; Philip Lovel was &s;everely fined on an accu&s;ation of bribery by the Jews, from whom he had collected the talliage; a company of Italian mer|chants

Simor de Montfort, earl of Leice&s;ter, had made con&s;ider|able progre&s;s in Guienne, and now returning to &s;ollicit a &s;upply of money for pro&s;ecuting his &s;ucce&s;s, received part of tho&s;e exactions, with which he went back and rai&s;ed a body of Brabantines and cro&s;s-bow men, who contributed to the reduction of the malecontent barons in that province.</P>

<P>Alexander, king of Scotland, dying, was &s;ucceeded by his &s;on of the &s;ame name, who, though &s;till a boy, began to &s;ecure &s;ome places on the border of England, and &s;eemed to threaten an inva&s;ion. Henry forthwith a&s;|&s;embled a numerous army, and began his march towards the north to oppo&s;e the progre&s;s of the Scotti&s;h king; but, before he proceeded to ho&s;tilities, John Man&s;el was &s;ent before to treat of an accommodation. This was ea&s;ily effected by means of the match between Margaret, daughter of Henry, and young Alexander, who repaired to York on a vi&s;it to the Engli&s;h monarch, by whom he was knighted; and the marriage-ceremony was performed with great &s;o|lemnity, in pre&s;ence of Henry and the queen-mother of Scotland, attended by the chief nobility of both kingdoms. Alexander, on this occa&s;ion, did homage to his father-in-law for Lothian, but ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to acknow|lege the dependence of his whole kingdom, until he &s;hould have deliberated with his parliament upon an affair of &s;uch con&s;equence; and Henry admitted the excu&s;e. The nuptials being &s;olemnized with great magnificence, Alexan|der received a bond for five thou&s;and marks as the portion of his wife, with whom he returned to his own country, whither &s;he was attended by Maude de Canteloupe, and &s;ome di&s;creet ladies appointed to &s;uperintend her education.</P>

<P>Having thus provided for the tranquillity of England, he con|verted<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

In the beginning of the year, he a&s;&s;em|bled all the prelates in London, and produced the pope's bull, commanding them to pay the tenth of their revenues; but they ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to com|ply with the impo&s;ition, or even compound the matter in any &s;hape, alledging they could take no &s;teps in the affair, without the concurrence of the two arch|bi&s;hops who were ab&s;ent. Innocent, in order to prevent delays, was no &s;ooner informed of their contumacy, than he accommodated Henry with fre&s;h bulls, granting him a twentieth of all eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues, a tenth of all the lands belonging to prelates, the cru&s;ade commutation money, and that which the pope claimed as ari&s;ing from &s;tolen goods, u&s;ury, and legacies for charitable u&s;es; at the &s;ame time, he took the king and his dominions under his imme|diate protection. Over and above the&s;e re&s;ources, Henry laid a talliage on all his deme&s;nes, as well as upon tho&s;e that had been alienated from the crown; nor were the late conque&s;ts in Wales exempted from this impo&s;ition.</P>

<P>After a &s;ufficient fund had been thus provided, the king's de|parture was delayed by the di&s;turbances of Ga&s;cony. Deputies arrived from that province, with complaints again&s;t the earl of Leice&s;ter, by whom the natives were oppre&s;&s;ed; and Simon him&s;elf came over to ju&s;tify his conduct. Not contented with denying the imputations ca&s;t upon his government, he, with great heat and indecency, upbraided the king for li&s;tening to &s;uch frivo|lous complaints again&s;t a man who had &s;erved him &s;o faithfully, and even ex|pended
<PB N="506" REF="5150">
his whole fortune in an employment, by which other governors had been enriched. Henry a&s;&s;ured him, that he did not believe the accu&s;ations; and that in order to manife&s;t his innocence, he would &s;end commi&s;&s;aries into Guienne, to examine into the conduct of the inhabitants; in the mean time, as a convincing proof of his confidence and regard, he &s;upplied him with a &s;um of money, and de&s;ired he would hold him&s;elf in readine&s;s to return and rea&s;&s;ume his admini&s;tration. The Ga&s;cons being informed of the king's intention, depu|ted the archbi&s;hop of Bourdeaux to repeat their complaints, and renew their pe|tition for another governor; and during this prelate's re&s;idence at London, the commi&s;&s;ioners returned from Ga&s;cony, where they had examined the di&s;pute between the earl and the people. Their report was favourable to Leice&s;ter: but as the archbi&s;hop a&s;&s;ured the king, that if he &s;hould return, there would be a total revolt in the province, Henry, rather than run the ri&s;que of &s;uch a re|bellion, re&s;olved to &s;acrifice Leice&s;ter to their re&s;entment; and ordered the ar|ticles of his impeachment to be carried before his peers, that he might be tried by the laws of the kingdom. The earl, knowing the king's caprice and incon|&s;tancy, had, by this time, engaged prince Richard, with the earl of Glouce&s;|ter, and &s;everal powerful noblemen in his intere&s;t; thus &s;upported he appeared in court, and vindicated him&s;elf in &s;uch a manner as &s;eemed &s;atisfactory to his judges, who were indeed re&s;olved to acquit him what&s;oever &s;hould happen. The archbi&s;hop of Bourdeaux was brow-beaten, and &s;o confounded by the partiality of the bench, that he could hardly proceed with his evidence: Henry him&s;elf was irritated to &s;uch a degree by the in&s;olence of Leice&s;ter, that, in the tran&s;port of his pa&s;&s;ion, he could not help venting &s;ome injurious expre&s;|&s;ions, which provoked Montfort to accu&s;e him of ingratitude, and demand, in the mo&s;t arrogant manner, the recompence he had &s;o often promi&s;ed, in con&s;i|deration of his manifold &s;ervices. The king an&s;wered, in a rage of indigna|tion, that he did not think him&s;elf obliged to perform his promi&s;e to a traitor: and this word was no &s;ooner pronounced, than the other told him he lied; that he believed he never went to confe&s;&s;ion, or if he did, it was not attended with repentance. <Q>&startq;I never repented any thing &s;o much (&s;aid the king) as my hav|ing lavi&s;hed &s;o many favours upon a man like you, &s;o de&s;titute of gratitude and decorum.&endq;</Q> So &s;aying, he intended to arre&s;t the earl upon the &s;pot; but perceiving a number of the barons ready to protect him, his indignation gave way to his fear, and he was fain to &s;mother his re&s;entment: he even li&s;tened<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron. Dun|$$$p$e. R$mer. Ma$. Paris.</NOTE> to propo&s;als of accommodation made by the nobility, and was outwardly re|conciled to Leice&s;ter, though the in&s;olence of that nobleman had made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon his mind, that he could never afterwards behold him with|out horror.</P>

<P>Notwith&s;tanding this re&s;entment, he &s;ent him back to Ga&s;|cony, partly becau&s;e he dur&s;t not venture to appoint another governor, and partly from his apprehen&s;ion of the earl's intrigues and ambition, which he could not pro&s;ecute at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the kingdom; but, in order to in|d$lge the Ga&s;cons with the pro&s;pect of being one day relieved from his ty|ranny, he, by an authentic deed, conveyed that province and the i&s;le of Ole|ron to his elde&s;t &s;on Edward, re&s;erving to him&s;elf the &s;overeignty for life; and &s;uch of the natives as were in England did homage to the young prince.

again&s;t the G$&s;cons, and, at his arrival, &s;et the whole province in a flame. He renewed the ho&s;tilities which the truce had interrupted, and attacked the nobility with implacable fury and revenge: but his pa&s;&s;ion hurried him into &s;uch indi&s;cretion and mi&s;conduct, that he at length found him&s;elf be&s;ieged in Montauban, and was obliged to purcha&s;e a capitulation by setting all his pri|&s;oners at liberty. Chagrined at this di&s;grace, he re&s;igned his government and retired into France; though not before he had delivered three of the &s;tronge&s;t ca&s;tles to the revolters, and involved the province in civil war, confu&s;ion, and anarchy. Alphon&s;o X. king of Ca&s;tile, taking the advantage of the&s;e di&s;tur|bances, trumped up a claim to &s;ome part of it, founded upon a grant of Hen|ry II. and Eleanor of Guienne, to Alphon&s;o VIII. who married their daugh|ter; he fou$d means to engage &s;everal noblemen in &s;upport of this preten&s;ion; and the whole province renounced its allegiance to Henry, except the city of Bourdeaux, and the adjoining territory, which was in the utmo&s;t danger of being lo&s;t for want of proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance from England. The pope excommu|nicated<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1253.</NOTE> Ga&s;ton de Bearne, and all the adherents of Alphon&s;o; and Henry re|&s;olved to go thither in per&s;on. With this view, he i&s;&s;ued writs for a general mu&s;ter of tho&s;e who were obliged to have arms, that they might be in a con|dition to keep watch and ward in all the towns and cities, and maintain the peace of the nation in his ab&s;ence; then he prepared a fund for defraying the expence of the expedition, by rai&s;ing an aid upon his own deme&s;nes, and &s;um|moning all who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed fifteen pounds a year by military tenure, to come and receive knighthood. He rai&s;ed money by di&s;pen&s;ing with the execution of &s;ome ordinances made again&s;t the Jews; and, as he had a right to demand a &s;cutage of all his military tenants for the knighting of his elde&s;t &s;on, he a&s;&s;em|bled a parliament at We&s;tmin&s;ter, in hope that the barons would &s;ettle it at a higher rate than he would chu&s;e to a&s;&s;e&s;s by his own authority.</P>

<P>Upon this occa&s;ion, he explained the &s;ituation of Ga&s;cony, and the nece&s;&s;ity for taking vigorous mea&s;ures for the recovery of that pro|vince. After long debates the laity agreed to the &s;cutage, and the prelates con&s;ented to the impo&s;ition, according to the pope's bull, which they had for|merly rejected. But they complained of the king's having over-ruled the elections of bi&s;hops and abbots, contrary to the fir&s;t article of the magna charta; and in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;atisfaction for the&s;e grievances. The king had ex|pected the demand, and prepared his an&s;wer accordingly. He owned that, upon &s;ome occa&s;ions, he had extended the royal prerogative too far; but that he had laid down a firm re&s;olution to reform his conduct, and would take care to ob&s;erve the charters with the utmo&s;t punctuality. In pur&s;uance of this de|claration, he, of his own accord, convened all the lords &s;piritual and temporal in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall, where every individual appeared with a lighted taper in his hand, while the king him&s;elf &s;tood with his hand upon his heart, in token of his &s;incerity. Then the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury pronounced aloud, a mo&s;t dreadful anathema again&s;t all tho&s;e who &s;hould directly or indirectly oppo&s;e the execution of the two charters; or violate, dimini&s;h, or change in any &s;hape, the laws and con&s;titutions of the kingdom.

<P>How &s;i$$$re &s;oev$r Henry might have been during this cere|mo$y, certa$n it is, the parliam$nt was no &s;ooner di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, than he endea|voured to free him&s;$lf from tho&s;e $ett$rs to which he had &s;o &s;olemnly &s;ubjected him$$$f. He was naturally incon&s;tant, and not at all &s;ubject to &s;cruples of con|$cience; and his favourites continually prompted him to renounce tho&s;e re&s;tric|tions that di&s;graced his &s;overeign dignity. Perceiving him unea&s;y at the con|&s;ideration of his oath, they advi&s;ed him to communicate his anxiety to the pope, who, for a pecuniary con&s;ideration, would di&s;engage him from that maze in which he was intangled; and this pernicious coun&s;el, &s;o contrary to the dic|tates of honour and religion, had too much influence over his future conduct. Mean while, he &s;ummoned his military tenants to meet him at Port&s;mouth, on the twenty-&s;econd of June, and laid an embargo on the &s;hipping for their tran&s;|portation to the continent: but, that he might leave no ill blood in the king|dom, he thought proper to reconcile him&s;elf to the citizens of London, whom he had provoked by the mo&s;t arbitrary acts of oppre&s;&s;ion. The fair he had in|&s;tituted at We&s;tmin&s;ter, was con&s;idered as &s;uch a grievance by the Londoners, that divers tumults en&s;ued, and the populace had more than once in&s;ulted the king's &s;ervants. Provoked at the&s;e outrages, he had &s;eized their charters, and appointed a guardian to rule over the city; &s;o that being thus en&s;laved, they could not be friends to his admini&s;tration: but he now made an atonement<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$t.

<P>This &s;alutary mea&s;ure being taken, he appointed the queen guar|dian of the realm, to be ruled by the direction of his brother Richard, in who&s;e cu&s;tody he left the great &s;eal; and embarking at Port&s;mouth on the &s;ixth day of Augu&s;t, arrived about the middle of the month at Bourdeaux, which he found very much hampered by the garri&s;ons of Fron&s;ac, Benanges, and La Reole. The&s;e had been given up treacherou&s;ly to the Ga&s;con revolters by Simon de Montfort, but they were &s;oon reduced by the Engli&s;h forces, who drove the rebels out of the province, and compelled their chief Ga&s;ton de<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

As this monarch threatened a new inva&s;ion of Ga&s;cony, Henry wrote to the queen and prince Richard for an immediate reinforcement; and a parliament was im|mediately &s;ummoned to meet at We&s;tmin&s;ter, where the lay nobility entered into a re&s;olution, to meet in the beginning of May at London, and proceed immediately to Port&s;mouth, where they would take &s;hipping for Ga&s;cony, provided the king of Ca&s;tile &s;hould invade that province. The prelates of Canterbury, Winche&s;ter, London, and Worce&s;ter, engaged to &s;erve in per|&s;on, and the other bi&s;hops promi&s;ed con&s;iderable &s;upplies of money. The military tenants of the crown in Ireland, were ordered to hold them&s;elves in readine&s;s to embark at Waterford immediately after Ea&s;ter; and an aid was demanded from the prelates and barons of that kingdom, a&s;&s;embled for the purpo&s;e at Dublin. In England the &s;ame mea&s;ures were pur&s;ued: all who held twenty pounds a year in capite of the king, or of minors in his ward&s;hip, were ordered to appear at Port&s;mouth on the day of rendezvous; and writs were i&s;&s;ued to the &s;heriffs, commanding them to return two legal and di&s;$reet knights, to rep$$&s;ent each county before the king's council at We&s;tmin&s;ter, to

<P>Henry, who&s;e genius was not at all calculated for war, propo&s;ed terms of accommodation to the king of Ca&s;tile, and even to engage in a league with him, cemented by a marriage between Alphon&s;o's half &s;i&s;ter Eleanor and prince Edward, on whom he now be&s;towed a grant of Ireland, with the earl|dom of Che&s;ter, the town and ca&s;tle of Bri&s;tol, and all his dominions on the continent, whether u&s;urped by foreign power or in actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown of England. This treaty was negotiated by Peter bi&s;hop of Hereford and John Man&s;el provo&s;t of Beverley, who &s;et out with the character of am|ba&s;&s;adors for the court of Ca&s;tile, where they met with &s;uch a favourable recep|tion, that in the beginning of April the marriage-contract was &s;ettled, together with the articles of a treaty offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, importing that Alphon&s;o &s;hould give up all claim to Ga&s;cony; that Henry &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his war again&s;t the king of Navarre, be&s;tow his daughter on Alphon&s;o's brother, and u&s;e his influence with the pope to commute his vow to &s;erve in Pale&s;tine, for an expedition again&s;t the infidels of Africa; that Ga&s;ton de Bearne and the other lords who adhered to the king of Ca&s;tile, &s;hould be re&s;tored to the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of their e&s;tates; and that prince Edward &s;hould be brought to Bour|deaux immediately, and proceed to Burgos, &s;o that he might be knighted by his Ca&s;tilian maje&s;ty, and married to his &s;i&s;ter within five weeks after Michael|mas. In con&s;equence of this treaty young Edward, being now in the &s;ixteenth year of his age, went over with his mother and &s;i&s;ter Beatrice to Bourdeaux, where he ratified the articles relating to his alliance, then proceeded to the court of Ca&s;tile, where he was received with great honours, and univer&s;ally ad|mired. Here he remained for &s;ome time after the &s;olemnization of his nup|tials, and returned to Bourdeaux before his father quitted that city. Henry, unwilling to run the ri&s;que of a long pa&s;&s;age by &s;ea, re&s;olved to travel by land to Calais; and taking Paris in his way, was &s;umptuou&s;ly entertained by Lewis ju&s;t then returned from Pale&s;tine. From that capital he continued his route to the &s;ea-&s;ide, and arrived at Dover about the latter end of December. He made a magnificent entry into London, the citizens of which pre&s;ented him with one hundred pounds, and a ma&s;&s;y piece of plate of curious workman&s;hip. But he<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat.

<P>During this expedition to Guienne, Henry had contracted a heavy load of debt, not only by the expence of his &s;on's marriage, but al&s;o by an incon&s;iderate contract with pope Innocent, who, not contented with per&s;e|cuting the emperor Frederic to his dying day, was re&s;olved to effect the ruin of his whole family. He had carried on a war again&s;t Frederic's two &s;ons Con|rad and Henry, and &s;ent his nuncio Albert into England, with an offer of the crown of Sicily to Richard, earl of Cornwal, who declined the propo&s;al of en|gaging in an expen&s;ive war again&s;t his own nephew. Henry was not &s;o &s;cru|pulous; for the &s;ame &s;cheme being offered to his con&s;ideration, in favour of his &s;econd &s;on Edmund, he &s;ubmitted to all the conditions impo&s;ed by his ho|line&s;s; engaged him&s;elf and his realm for unlimited &s;ums, &s;upplied him with

all the money in his own exchequer, as well as with what he could extort from the Jews, who were mi&s;erably oppre&s;&s;ed; together with the &s;ums he could bor|row from his brother Richard, and the Italian merchants, at exorbitant in|tere&s;t. By this time indeed his enterprize a&s;&s;umed a more honourable a&s;pect; for his nephew Henry had been a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated at Melphi by the direction of his own brother Conrad, who was in his turn poi&s;oned by his ba&s;tard brother Main$roy. This illegitimate &s;on of Frederic a&s;cended the throne of Sicily. What was before the effect of revenge, in pope Innocent, now adopted the colour of ju&s;tice: he a&s;&s;embled an army to dethrone the u&s;urper; but his troops were routed, and him&s;elf in danger of being be&s;ieged in Rome by the conqueror. It was on the back of this di&s;a&s;ter that he repeated his in&s;tances to Henry, who racked his own credit to the utmo&s;t &s;tretch, with a view to retrieve the affairs of his holine&s;s, and enable him to conquer Sicily for his &s;on Edmund.</P>

<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e tran&s;actions Innocent died, and was &s;uc|ceeded in the papacy by Alexander IV. who adopted the projects of his pre|dece&s;&s;or, maintained the war in Apuglia, and gratified Edmund with the in|ve&s;titure of the kingdom of Sicily, performed with the ring by the bi&s;hop of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

While the bi&s;hop was on the road, Alexander's forces were utterly defeated at Nocera by Mainfroy, who by this victory made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Apuglia, and was crowned king of the two Sicilies at Palermo. Though the bi&s;hop was well informed of this unlucky revolution in the affairs of Alexander, he men|tioned not a word of the defeat to Henry, who ordered the ceremony of the inve&s;titure to be performed with great magnificence, and vainly expected to extract con&s;iderable &s;ub&s;idies from his people for the &s;upport of this new dig|nity. In this hope he convoked a parliament, of which he demanded a &s;up|ply of money with as much confidence as if he had engaged in &s;ome important &s;cheme for the advantage of the nation. But the barons were very little in|tere&s;ted in the affairs of Sicily; though they promi&s;ed to grant a &s;ub&s;idy, on condition that the two charters &s;hould be punctually ob&s;erved, and the lord high trea&s;urer and ju&s;ticiary appointed by parliament, independent of the king's authority. Henry, aver&s;e to the&s;e propo&s;als, prorogued the parlia|ment, and repaired to Scotland to manage the intere&s;t of his daughter, who complained of the regency of that kingdom, involved in the troubles that com|monly attend a king's minority.</P>

<P>Having quelled the di&s;turbances of Scotland, he returned to his own dominions, where his pre&s;ence was nece&s;&s;ary to adju&s;t the particulars of his Sicilian project; and now he found it ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to pay the &s;ums which had been borrowed by the late pope in his name, for the reduction of that kingdom. He could not even hu&s;h the clamours of his creditors; and though Alexander was not ignorant of his di&s;tre&s;s, he practi&s;ed every method he could invent to drain more money from this exhau&s;ted kingdom. He &s;ent over a nuncio called Ru&s;tan, with bulls for rai&s;ing contributions on the clergy. The fir&s;t which this legate produced, impowered him to levy the tythes in England, Ireland, and even in Scotland, for the u&s;e of the pope and king

Henry. He afterwards publi&s;hed a &s;econd bull, propo&s;ing to commute the vow of a pilgrimage to Pale&s;tine, for another to &s;erve again&s;t Mainfroy as an enemy of the chri&s;tian name; and a cru&s;ade was preached up for this purpo&s;e, with promi&s;e of a general indulgence to all tho&s;e who &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t the holy &s;ee in depo&s;ing that excommunicated u&s;urper. The parliament being rea&s;&s;embled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat.

But he found this a&s;&s;embly &s;taunch to the &s;ame &s;entiments; and they even turned his own artifice again&s;t him&s;elf, by affirming they could not com|ply with his demand, in the ab&s;ence of tho&s;e who having a right to &s;it in parlia|ment, were not &s;ummoned to attend. Thus di&s;appointed, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the a&s;&s;embly, and converted his attention to other expedients. He in vain at|tempted to borrow &s;ums from his brother Richard, who was incen&s;ed at his engaging in &s;uch an enterprize, without his concurrence or advice; and this re&s;ource failing, he was obliged to depend upon the exactions of the pope, au|thorized by bulls which no per&s;on of candour or &s;en&s;ibility can read without indignation. This rapacious pontiff, not only oppre&s;&s;ed England with the mo&s;t &s;hameful impo&s;itions, but even burthened Scotland and Norway with contributions to maintain his own private intere&s;t. To this he &s;acrificed the chri&s;tians in Pale&s;tine, by converting the &s;ums and &s;oldiers de&s;tined for their relief to the conque&s;t of Sicily, to which he could have no ju&s;t preten&s;ion: practices &s;o little &s;uitable to the character of a patriarch, that they even di&s;grace humanity.</P>

<P>Henry him&s;elf was made a dupe to the avarice and villainy of Alexander; for the immen&s;e &s;ums levied on pretence of rai&s;ing Edmund to the throne of Sicily, were chiefly appropriated to the pope's own private oc|ca&s;ions, while Mainfroy enjoyed his crown without mole&s;tation. The debt contracted in the name of Henry for the atchievement of this enterprize, amounted according to Alexander's accompt to one hundred thirty five thou|&s;and five hundred and forty marks of &s;ilver, exclu&s;ive of intere&s;t; and as he knew the king's revenues were hardly &s;ufficient for the expence of his hou&s;ehold, he contrived a notable &s;cheme of fraud and oppre&s;&s;ion, to di&s;charge this incum|brance. A great number of obligatory bills were expedited, owning the re|ceipt of particular &s;ums of money from certain merchants of Sienna and Flo|tence; and the&s;e he propo&s;ed that the Engli&s;h clergy &s;hould &s;ub&s;cribe, for &s;ums proportioned to the benefices of each individual. When Ru&s;tan a&s;&s;embled the prelates on this occa&s;ion, and &s;ignified the demand of his holine&s;s, the bi&s;hop of London declared that he would rather lo&s;e his head than &s;ubmit to &s;uch tyranny. He was &s;econded by the bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter; and the whole a&s;&s;embly made an&s;wer that the clergy of England would not be en&s;laved by the pope. The nuncio complained of this refu&s;al to Henry, who told the bi&s;hop of London he would make him feel the effects of his indignation. The prelate, far from being di&s;mayed, replied that he knew the king and the pope were his &s;uperiors; but that &s;hould they deprive him of his mitre he would &s;upply its place with a helmet. The nuncio not yet repul&s;ed had re|cour&s;e to private negotiation. He with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the bi&s;hop of Here|ford, who had engaged in the project from the beginning, cajoled &s;ome pre|lates with promi&s;es, and intimidated others with threats of pro&s;ecutions and ex|communication,
<PB N="512" REF="5210">
t$$$ at length he had prepared th$m for implicit obedience. Then he convoked another a&s;&s;embly; but the ar$hbi&s;hop of Canterbury being abroad and the &s;ee of York vacant, the prelates made u&s;e of the&s;e pretences for po&s;tponing the det$rmination of this affair, and Ru&s;tan could not deny their reque&s;t; tho' he in&s;ulted in the mo&s;t virulent terms two eccle&s;ia&s;tics who vent$red to explain their &s;entiments on the inju&s;tice of &s;uch a demand. The d$$ay produced nothing favourable to the clergy. The term of re&s;pite which they ob$ain$d was no &s;ooner expired than they were again a&s;&s;embled at London, and the nuncio renewed his demand. Leonard, agent for the clergy, replied that $$eir poverty would not permit them to comply with the pope's mandate, which be&s;ides was highly unrea&s;onable and unju&s;t. Ru&s;tan alledged that all the churches belonged to his holine&s;s, who might therefore di&s;po&s;e of them according to his plea&s;ure. Leonard denied this po&s;ition, ob&s;erving that al|though the churches acknowledged the pope as their &s;uperior and protector, they never owned him as their proprietor; nor had he a better right to the effects of the clergy than the king had to the e&s;tates of his people. The nun|cio, enraged at this an&s;wer, which he could not refute, demanded aloud that every individual &s;hould &s;peak for him&s;elf; &s;o as that the &s;entiments of each might be known to his holine&s;s. His intention was to terrify the a&s;&s;embly; but this behaviour produced a contrary effect: the prelates incen&s;ed at his ar|rogance declared unanimou&s;ly that they neither could nor would &s;ubmit to &s;uch an unju&s;t exaction; and that they would &s;uffer death rather than alter their re|&s;olution. Ru&s;tan, con&s;cious of his own indi&s;cretion, changed his battery, and en|deavoured to appea&s;e their re&s;entment with &s;ofter expre&s;&s;ions. He &s;aid he would return to Rome, and endeavour to mitigate the demand of his holine&s;s; and the dean of St. Paul's was deputed by the clergy to explain the motives<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1256.</NOTE> of their refu&s;al. Alexander pretended that the &s;ums had been really borrowed for the &s;ervice of the king and the church of England; and propo&s;ed another expedient, from which he would not recede. He in&s;i&s;ted upon their paying the bills according to his fir&s;t calculation, but agreed that the &s;ums &s;hould be de|ducted from the tythes which might be granted to his maje&s;ty in the &s;equel; and to this determination the clergy of England were obliged to &s;ubmit. This di$ference was no &s;ooner compromi&s;ed, than the nuncio demanded one year's wool from the Ci&s;tercians for the pope's occa&s;ions; and they an&s;wered, that they could not comply with the demand until it &s;hould be con&s;idered in a general chapter of the order. Ru&s;tan, exa&s;perated at this eva&s;ion, &s;wore that &s;ince he could not per&s;uade them in a body, he would be revenged on each in particular; and began to pro&s;ecute the individuals for pretended faults, which he obliged them to attone by the payment of con&s;iderable &s;ums. But they com|plained<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. Paris. Act.

<P>During the&s;e di&s;putes between the pope and the clergy, the king exerted all his influence in &s;olliciting the barons to grant the &s;ub&s;idy he had demanded for elevating prince Edmund to the Sicilian throne. The arch|bi&s;hop of Me&s;&s;ina was &s;ent with letters from the pope to the nobility, exhort|ing them in the mo&s;t earne&s;t manner to comply with the reque&s;t of their &s;o|vereign. But the eagerne&s;s of his holine&s;s defeated the purpo&s;e which it was intended to &s;erve; for the barons perceived that the &s;ub&s;idy would pa&s;s

through the hands of Alexander, who&s;e integrity they had &s;o much rea&s;on to doubt; and they were extremely unwilling to &s;end forces into Italy, where they would be expo&s;ed to inevitable ruin. They, therefore, refu&s;ed to com|ply with the king's demand, alledging that the enterprize was dangerous, and the kingdom impoveri&s;hed; that they &s;hould run the ri&s;que of an inva|&s;ion by unfurni&s;hing the kingdom of its troops; that the &s;cheme was pro|jected without the con&s;ent of parliament; and that the gift of the kingdom of Sicily was clogged with &s;uch re&s;trictions by the pope, as rendered it altogether precarious, and unworthy of the expence with which it was attended. Thus repul&s;ed by the parliament, he renewed his attack upon the clergy; and, with the pope's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, extorted from them a continuation of the tythes which were granted at fir&s;t for the term of three years only. He likewi&s;e pro|ceeded with his exactions from the Londoners, and other cities of the king|dom; and even extended his acts of oppre&s;&s;ion to the Wel&s;h, whom he con|&s;idered as his own &s;ubjects, and fleeced accordingly. At length their patience being exhau&s;ted with their &s;ub&s;tance, they had recour&s;e to their arms, and in|demnified them&s;elves by carrying off a great booty from the territories of England; while the indigence of Henry obliged him to &s;it &s;till and behold his dominions thus ravaged with impunity. Mean while the pope, who&s;e avarice was in&s;atiable, continually importuned this weak prince for fre&s;h &s;up|plies of money, and even threatened to revoke his gift of Sicily, unle&s;s Henry would immediately perform his promi&s;e of &s;ending Engli&s;h forces into Italy. The king repre&s;ented his utter inability to defray the expence of &s;uch an ex|pedition; but accommodated him with five thou&s;and marks, and commanded prince Edward, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, to ratify the Sicilian convention: at the &s;ame time he complained of the inflexibility of his barons, who had ab&s;olutely re|fu&s;ed to &s;upport him in the pro&s;ecution of his de&s;ign.</P>

<P>Alexander concluding from this information that his influ|ence in England drew near a period, re&s;olved to improve the pre&s;ent oppor|tunity to the utmo&s;t of his power; and with this view &s;ent John de Die as his nuncio, with a fre&s;h cargo of bulls for rai&s;ing money to pay the king's pretended debts to his holine&s;s. By the fir&s;t, he ordered the bi&s;hops to pay the tythes granted to the king without the deduction which had been &s;tipulated: a &s;econd granted to the king all the revenues of vacant bi&s;hoprics, on pretence of helping to defray his voyage to the Holy Land, tho' he him&s;elf had already agreed to a commutation of this engagement. A third indulged him with all the revenues of &s;uch eccle&s;ia&s;tics as did not re&s;ide in their benefices: by a fourth he was intitled to the tythes of all eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues according to their ju&s;t valuation, whereas they were hitherto rated according to ancient taxation: a fifth impowered Ru&s;tan to adjudge in the king's favour the im|moveables of all eccle&s;ia&s;tics who &s;hould die inte&s;tate: a &s;ixth directed the nuncio to lay a tax upon all the clergy of the kingdom, for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their &s;overeign, notwith&s;tanding any privileges or exemptions granted by his predece&s;&s;ors, or any oppo&s;ition that &s;hould be made to his authority: in a &s;eventh he excommunicated all the prelates who &s;hould not pay their pro|portion within the term pre&s;cribed; and &s;everal other mandates concurred in pro&s;ecution of the &s;ame purpo&s;e of rai$ing money to &s;atisfy the pretended cre|ditors

<P>England &s;eemed devoted to beggary and di&s;tre&s;s, by a con|cu$ren$e of unfavourable events, which gratified the king's vanity and $word$ to foreign connexions. William, count of Holland, and king of t$e Roma$s, being &s;lain in Frie&s;land, the princes of the empire were divided in their choice of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or to that dignity: the majority voted in favour of Richard, earl of Cornwal, and the re&s;t elected Alphon&s;o, king of Ca&s;tile. The election of Richard was very di&s;agreeable to the king of France, &s;ituated between the two powers of England and Germany, which might unite again&s;t him, in order to recover the dominions which had formerly belonged to their<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ $h. 12$$.</NOTE> ance&s;tors. In this apprehen&s;ion he fortified his frontiers, and endeavoured to intercept the earl of Glouce&s;ter, and John Man&s;el, whom Richard had &s;ent to Germany to make their ob&s;ervations on the country and &s;tate of the prin|ces, before he would venture him&s;elf among them; for, tho' he had bribed a majority, the other electors were very clamorous, the bi&s;hop of Triers declared for Alphon&s;o, and even promi&s;ed great &s;ums to tho&s;e who would e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of that monarch. Richard having received a favourable account from his agents, re&s;olved to go thither in per&s;on; and knowing the venal di&s;po&s;ition of the Germans, he laid in &s;uch a &s;tore of money as no &s;overeign prince in Europe could have rai&s;ed on the like occa&s;ion. This he collected not only from his va&s;t e&s;tate, but al&s;o from his farm of the mint, and from the Jews, for whom he procured an exemption from talliage for the &s;pace of five years. Thus furni&s;hed, he embarked at Yarmouth, with the bi&s;hops of Cologne, Liege, and Utrecht, Florence count of Holland, and &s;everal Ger|man noblemen, who had come to England, in order to accompany him in his voyage; and he was attended by a good number of the Engli&s;h nobility. After having repo&s;ed him&s;elf two days at Dort, he proceeded to Aix la Cha|pelle, where he was crowned king of the Romans by Conrad, archbi&s;hop of Cologne, as the elector of Mentz, who&s;e right it was to perform this cere|mony, at that time lay under the &s;entence of excommunication. The coro|nation and knighthood of his elde&s;t &s;on Henry were &s;olemnized with &s;uch magnificence as could not but be agreeable to the mercenary Germans, who neverthele&s;s in&s;i&s;ted upon his &s;ending home all the Engli&s;h noblemen, tho' they had intended to &s;tay a whole year abroad; and having in le&s;s than<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat.

<P N="89">LXXXIX.

Notwith&s;tanding this national di&s;a&s;ter, Henry, &s;till infatuated by the Sicilian project, importuned the c$ergy for a new &s;ub&s;idy, a&s;&s;uring them that the former was not &s;ufficient to pay the debts he had con|tracted; and, in order to &s;often the hearts of the prelates, brought his &s;on Ed|mund into the a&s;&s;embly, in a Sicilian habit, vainly imagining they would be, like him&s;elf, charmed with the appearance.

Geffrey de Langley, go|vernor of the country between Che&s;hire and the river of Conway, which had been ceded to Henry at the la&s;t pacification, attempted to introduce the Eng|li&s;h laws, and courts of judicature, among the inhabitants of that di&s;trict. The Wel&s;h, who are extremely bigotted to their own cu&s;toms, took the alarm; and, as the peace had been already violated on both &s;ides by mutual depredations, Llewellyn a&s;&s;embled a &s;trong body of hor&s;e and foot, with which he obtained &s;everal advantages over the wardens of the Engli&s;h marches; he over-ran that part of Wales which was under the protection of Henry, and at length inve&s;ted the ca&s;tle of Gannock, which was built for the defence of that territory. The king had hitherto winked at his progre&s;s, which indeed he could not conveniently &s;top; but, now alarmed by the pro&s;pect of lo&s;ing the only conque&s;t he had ever made, he &s;ummoned his barons, and military at|tendants of the north, to attend him at Che&s;ter, and appointed a rendezvous at Bri&s;tol for the we&s;tern counties, re&s;olving to divide the forces of the enemy, by attacking them at once in different quarters: at the &s;ame time, he ordered a body of troops from Ireland to land upon the i&s;le of Angle&s;ey, which &s;upplied the Wel&s;h with the be&s;t part of their provi&s;ions. The&s;e precautions being taken, he entered North Wales with his army, and advancing to Gannock, remained inactive till Michaelmas, in expectation of the Iri&s;h forces, which never arrived; while the we&s;tern divi&s;ion, ordered to make a diver&s;ion in South Wales, delayed executing their orders, pretending they could not act in the ab&s;ence of their general, Richard de Clare, earl of Glouce&s;ter, who was &s;u&s;pected of holding a corre&s;pondence with Llewellyn: &s;o that Henry was obliged to return, after<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr.

<P>HENRY &s;oon furni&s;hed the barons with an opportunity to execute their de&s;ign; for he convoked a parliament; and, according to cu&s;tom, demanded a powerful &s;upply to carry on the conque&s;t of Sicily. He could not have touched them upon a more di&s;cordant &s;tring. They had been &s;o harra&s;&s;ed and exhau&s;ted by this ridiculcus &s;cheme, that they could not hear it mentioned without being filled with indignation. In&s;tead of complying with his demand, they bitterly complained of his breach of promi&s;e; and re|mon&s;trated in the &s;tronge&s;t terms again&s;t all the abu&s;es of his government. In vain he endeavoured to ca$ole them by an affectation of candour and &s;incerity, confe&s;&s;ing his indi&s;cretion, and vowing a reformation in his conduct. This expedient had lo&s;t its effect. They told him plainly they would not depend upon his word; and therefore were re&s;olved to rectify the abu&s;es of his reign in &s;uch a manner, that they &s;hould have nothing to fear for the future from his incon&s;tancy. Terrified at this declaration, he promi&s;ed to concur with them in every &s;tep that could be taken for the advantage of the nation; and
<PB REF="5280">
even granted a writing, &s;ub&s;cribed with his own hand, by which he $span$ to the nomination of four and twenty noblemen, cho&s;en by him&s;elf and the parliament, to draw up the articles of reformation, to which he would $word$ &s;ubmit; and, as a farther proof of his &s;incerity, he ordered his &s;on Edward to &s;ign this obligation. Henry's behaviour on this occa&s;ion was the immediate effect of per&s;onal fear; for, he perceived a &s;trong confederacy was formed again&s;t him by the mo&s;t powerful nobility of the realm, &s;uch as Simon de Montfort, earl of Leice&s;ter, high &s;teward of England, Humphrey de Bohun high con&s;table, Roger Bigod earl mare&s;chal, and Richard de Clare earl of Glouce&s;ter, &s;ome of whom were governed by private animo&s;ity again&s;t the king's per&s;on and favourites; and others, in&s;tigated by ambition or &s;elf-intere&s;t, to retrench the prerogative of the crown. On the third day of the &s;e&s;&s;ion they appeared in the parliament-hou&s;e, clad in armour; a &s;ight at which the king was &s;o much &s;tartled, that he a&s;ked if he was a pri&s;oner. To this interrogation Roger Bigod an&s;wered, that he was not a pri&s;oner; but they were determined to expel all the Poitevins, and other foreigners, from England, and rectify the di&s;orders of the &s;tate. It was this appearance and declaration that induced him to comply with their propo&s;al, the execution of which was deferred till the next meeting, which he appointed at Oxford. During this interval, the ba|rons<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. Paris. Rymer.</NOTE> knowing how little they could depend upon his mo&s;t &s;olemn prote&s;tations, levied a body of forces; and, at the time pre&s;cribed, repaired to Oxford, well armed and attended, and firmly re&s;olved to execute their de&s;ign. The fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;e&s;&s;ion was to choo&s;e the council of four and twenty; and Simon de Montfort was at the head of the twelve whom the barons elected. The&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners began to deliberate immediately upon the &s;ubject of their<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1258.</NOTE> meeting; and in a little time they agreed to the following articles. That the king &s;hould confirm the great charter which he had &s;o often &s;worn to ob&s;erve; that the office of high ju&s;ticiary &s;hould be conferred upon a per&s;on of talents and integrity, who &s;hould admini&s;ter ju&s;tice to the poor and rich, without di&s;|tinction; that the chancellor, trea&s;urer, judges, and other mini&s;ters of the public, &s;hould be cho&s;en annually by the council of four and twenty; and that the parliament &s;hould be a&s;&s;embled once at lea&s;t in three years, to enact laws for the benefit of the kingdom. The parliament having approved of the&s;e ar|ticles, which were known by the appellation of the Statutes of Oxford, they were confirmed by the a&s;&s;ent of the king and prince Edward, who &s;olemnly &s;wore to ob&s;erve, and cau&s;e them to be ob&s;erved, to the utmo&s;t of his power <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e that con&s;tituted the king's council were Fulk Ba&s;&s;et bi&s;hop of London, Aymer de Valence elect of We&s;tmin&s;ter, Henry, &s;on of Richard king of the Romans, Guy de Luzignan, William de Valence, John earl of Warrenne, John earl of Warwick, John Man&s;el ju&s;ticiary, J. de Derlington abbot of We&s;tmin&s;ter, and Henry de Wingham chancellor.

The earl of Leice&s;ter, &s;till in&s;olent and impetuous, gave him to under&s;tand, that &s;hould

his father refu&s;e to concur with the barons in &s;uch &s;alutary mea&s;ures, he &s;hould not pre&s;erve one foot of land in England. But the mo&s;t indu&s;trious oppo|&s;ers of the &s;tatutes were the king's uterine brothers, again&s;t who&s;e influ|ence the&s;e regulations were chiefly levelled. William de Valence having de|clared that he would never con&s;ent to &s;uch re&s;trictions as tended to dimini&s;h the king's honour and authority; Leice&s;ter threatened him with a re&s;umption of the lands and ca&s;tles he enjoyed by grants from the crown; and when he an&s;wered that he knew how to defend his own property, Simon told him his head &s;hould pay for his di&s;obedience. William and his brother Aymer, elect of Winche&s;ter, &s;uppo&s;ing from this declaration that a de&s;ign was formed again&s;t their lives, privately withdrew to the &s;ea-&s;ide, in hope of e&s;caping to the con|tinent; but, as they could not find a ve&s;&s;el for their purpo&s;e, they took re|fuge in the ca&s;tle of Wolve&s;ham, belonging to the &s;ee of Winche&s;ter. The barons were no &s;ooner apprized of their flight, than they took hor&s;e and pur&s;ued them to that city, where without any formal adjournment they re|&s;umed their deliberations and fini&s;hed the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament. As they could not, without violation of the privileges of the church, attack the ca&s;tle to which the four brothers had retired, they had recour&s;e to a negotiation, pro|po&s;ing they &s;hould quit the kingdom, and &s;tay abroad until the &s;tate &s;hould be reformed, when the king might with the con&s;ent of his council permit them to return. Henry interpo&s;ing in their behalf, and offering &s;ecurity for their continuing quiet, without attempting to oppo&s;e the articles of reformation, they agreed that Guy and Geffrey &s;hould go into exile; and that the other two might remain in the kingdom, under &s;uch cu&s;tody as the barons &s;hould appoint, until the pacification of the troubles. William and Aymer did not much reli&s;h the &s;cheme of confinement, but cho&s;e to go abroad with their brothers, even though their e&s;tates &s;hould be &s;eque&s;tred by the barons, who allowed them a certain proportion for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and promi&s;ed the re&s;t &s;hould be payed at their return. The particulars of this agreement being adju&s;ted, they were &s;upplied with a &s;afe conduct; and after having been &s;tripped of about &s;even thou&s;and marks in ready money, embarked at Dover for the continent. Sums of money which they had depo&s;ited in divers religious hou&s;es, were &s;eized and &s;eque&s;tred, their lands confi&s;cated, agents &s;ent to Rome with letters to the pope, de&s;ining his holine&s;s to deprive Aymer of the admini&s;tration of Win|che&s;ter;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

<P>The barons, having thus expelled the foreigners that were &s;o odious to the nation, a&s;&s;ociated them&s;elves by a &s;olemn oath to maintain the Statutes of Oxford, at the hazard of their lives and fortunes; and they invited the citi|zens of London to join their a&s;&s;ociation: a propo&s;al which was readily embraced by the Londoners, who had always been at variance with Henry. They appointed a committee of fourper&s;ons to &s;upply vacancies in the king's council, by virtue of one of the articles, which provided that if any of the twelve barons &s;hould be ab&s;ent, the re&s;t might fill up their places. Under this pretext they con&s;tituted a council of their own party; and the king being intirely in their hands, ma|naged the affairs of the realm according to their own plea&s;ure. They exacted oaths from the people that they would ob&s;erve their regulations; and re&s;olved that all who &s;hould oppose or neglect their ordinances &s;hould be treated as ene|mies of the public. In a word, they were intoxicated with power, and became
<PB N="521" REF="5300">
tyrants in their turn. They be&s;towed offices on their friends and relations, reduced the king's authority to a meer &s;hadow, and even a&s;&s;embled parliaments without his con&s;ent or knowledge. In one of the&s;e they proceeded judicially again&s;t the foreigners whom they had expelled, and by an authentic act con|demned them to perpetual bani&s;hment; then they &s;ent deputies to the pope to ju&s;tify their proceedings, giving his holine&s;s to under&s;tand that they could not comply with his de&s;ires touching the conque&s;t of Sicily, becau&s;e the king had em|barked in that enterprize, without con&s;ulting his parliament or con&s;idering the &s;tate of the kingdom, which could by no means &s;upport the expence of &s;uch an expedition; be&s;ides, the conditions of the donation were too hard and im|practicable: neverthele&s;s if his holine&s;s would mitigate the terms of his pro|po&s;al, they would pro&s;ecute the project with all their power. They communi|cated the Statutes of Oxford as expedients to which they had been reduced by the weakne&s;s and incapacity of the king, who was entirely governed by the coun&s;els of foreigners, who had no tie to bind them down to the intere&s;t of the nation; and they mentioned the bi&s;hop elect of Winehe&s;ter as the chief author of all the mi&s;chiefs with which the kingdom had been afflicted. They repre|&s;ented that prelate as guilty of enormous crimes, in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of which he had de&s;ired to quit England, left he &s;hould be called to ac|count for his male practices; they accu&s;ed him of having advi&s;ed the king to violate his oath and promi&s;e: &s;o that they looked upon him as an enemy to the kingdom, from which they had driven him into perpetual ba|ni&s;hment. The pope, far from being &s;atisfied with this ju&s;tification, was in|cen&s;ed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. Pub.</NOTE> at their pre&s;umption, in renouncing the favourite &s;cheme from which he had derived &s;uch advantages: but perceiving they were at pre&s;ent too proud and elevated to brook reproof or menaces, he delayed an&s;wering their remon|&s;trance; and in the mean time, encouraged Henry in private with a&s;&s;urances of protection. Yet he &s;till pre&s;&s;ed him to pay the arrears due to the Italian mer|chants, and fixed a time for the di&s;charge of that obligation, at the expiration of which he &s;ent orders to the bi&s;hop of London to excommunicate all the debtors of tho&s;e merchants, without di&s;tinction of rank or circum&s;tance. This order, however, un&s;upported by the royal authority, was never put in execution; and the conque&s;t of Sicily was con&s;idered as a dangerous and chi|merical project, tending to the ruin of England. So little was Henry able to execute that de&s;ign, that he now &s;aw him&s;elf de&s;poiled of all his regal power, at the mercy of the barons, who compelled him to &s;ign orders every day to the prejudice and even ruin of his prerogative. Of all tho&s;e noblemen, he whom he hated mo&s;t was Simon de Montfort, earl of Leice&s;ter, his own bro|ther-in-law: he had never forgot or forgiven the in&s;ult he received from that nobleman in parliament; and he looked upon him as the chief author of his pre&s;ent misfortune. The dangerous &s;ituation to which he was reduced could not hinder him from manife&s;ting his &s;entiments on this &s;ubject; one day in going by water to the Tower, he was &s;urprized with a &s;udden &s;torm of wind accompanied with thunder and lightening, and ordered his people to row him a&s;hore immediately. The neare&s;t landing-place was at Durham &s;tairs, where he was received by the earl of Leice&s;ter, who &s;eeing him in great perturbation, a&s;ked if he was afraid of the thunder and lightening. To which interrogation Henry replied, "I am afraid of the &s;torm; but, by God's head! I am more afraid of thee than of all the thunder and lightening in the univer&s;e."</P>

<P>During Henry's ab&s;ence, the four and twenty governors of England, applied an effectual remedy to an abu&s;e of the court of Rome, again&s;t which the nation had long clamoured. All the be&s;t benefices of the kingdom were in the hands of Italian eccle&s;ia&s;tics, who, without re&s;iding on the &s;pot, farmed their livings to the be&s;t bidders, and the money was remitted to Italy; &s;o that there was hardly any &s;pecie left in the i&s;land. In order to redre&s;s this grievance, the governors publi&s;hed a proclamation, ordering all per&s;ons who farmed be|nefices belonging to foreigners, to depo&s;it the rents in the hands of certain receivers appointed for the purpo&s;e, on pain of &s;eeing their hou&s;es razed to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$.

Although the barons had hitherto acted with unanimity, many of them now began to take umbrage at the great authority engro&s;&s;ed by the earl of Leice&s;ter, who in a manner erected him&s;elf into the &s;overeign of the four and twenty; and the earl of Glouce&s;ter endeavoured to form a party, in order to counterballance his intere&s;t and be a check upon his ambition. He fir&s;t of all depr$ciated his conduct in private; and in&s;inuated that he had entered into a league with prince Edward, whom he intended to rai&s;e to the throne even in the lifetime of his father. This report reaching the ears of Henry, who was then at St. Omer, he was &s;o a$$righted at the intimation, that he could not re&s;olve upon his return to England, left his liberty or his life &s;hould be in danger; unt$l Edward being informed of his &s;u&s;picions, cleared him&s;elf of the imputa|tion in &s;uch a man$$r, as left no d$ubts in the brea&s;t of his father. Glouce&s;ter,
<PB N="523" REF="5320">
di&s;appointed in this quarter, attacked Leice&s;ter openly, charging him with divers malver&s;ations in Guienne as well as in England; and demanded that a day might be appointed to examine the articles of impeachment: the time was accordingly fixed, and the earl of Leice&s;ter appeared in his own defence; when his ac$u&s;er, either con&s;cious of his own want of evidence, or dreading the power of the culprit, de&s;ired the trial might be deferred, becau&s;e &s;ome of his witne&s;&s;es were ab&s;ent.

Carele&s;s and indolent as he was, he could not but feel and re&s;ent the&s;e mortifications; but, as there was no body near his per&s;on to whom he could communicate his chagrin, or by who&s;e coun&s;el he could hope to extri|cate him&s;elf from &s;uch re&s;trictions, he privately invited his brother Aymer, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, to return to England, hoping that his own character and the protection of the pope, who had by this time confirmed his election, would &s;ecure him from the per&s;ecution of the barons. That prelate had ac|cepted the invitation, and actually &s;et out from Rome for England, where his pre&s;ence would have infallibly produced fre&s;h troubles, had not death intercepted him at Paris, to the un&s;peakable joy of the barons, who could not have re|fu&s;ed him entrance into the kingdom, without coming to an open rupture with the pope, which it was their intere&s;t to avoid. Notwith&s;tanding this di&s;appoint|ment, the king per&s;i&s;ted in his de&s;ign to free him&s;elf from the yoke of the four and twenty. He hoped to draw &s;ome advantage from the quarrel between the earls of Leice&s;ter and Glouce&s;ter, which he knew was but externally accommo|dated; and he de&s;ired the pope would ab&s;olve him from the oath he had taken to ob&s;erve the Statutes of Oxford. That reque&s;t was readily granted by the pontiff, who&s;e intere&s;t was concerned as well as that of Henry, in effecting a change of government; but, Alexander dying before the di&s;pen&s;ation could be

<P>His &s;cruples being thus removed, he re&s;olved to pull off the ma&s;k without delay; and, in the mean time, endeavoured to gain over to his intere&s;t &s;ome of tho&s;e whom the governors had appointed to exerci&s;e offices of tru&s;t in the nation. Having partly &s;ucceeded in the&s;e attempts, he, without communi|cating his intention to any per&s;on whatever, appeared unexpectedly in the par|liament which was a&s;&s;embled at London, and declared, to the un&s;peakable a&s;toni&s;hment of the members, that they had promi&s;ed to pay his debts and augment his revenue, when he &s;igned the Statutes of Oxford; but, as they had not performed their promi&s;e, he did not think him&s;elf obliged to keep the oath he had there taken; that he would no longer make u&s;e of the coun&s;ellors who had been impo&s;ed upon him, but was determined to free him&s;elf from<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1261.</NOTE> &s;uch inglorious bonds, and a&s;&s;ert the dignity of his prerogative. So &s;aying he retired to the Tower, which he had previou&s;ly &s;ecured for his purpo&s;e, &s;eized all the money in the mint, publi&s;hed a proclamation di&s;carding the officers ap|pointed by the four and twenty, and nominating others in their room; and acted with &s;uch vigour, as &s;eemed to be the effect of a &s;teady re&s;olution to re|trieve<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. Paris.</NOTE> his independence. Prince Edward, who was then at Paris, being in|formed of this tran&s;action, and apprehen&s;ive of mi&s;chievous con&s;equences, re|turned to England immediately, in order to employ all his intere&s;t and endea|vours for preventing a civil war; and his arrival was expected with impatience by the barons, who hoped to convince him of his father's mi&s;conduct, and en|gage him as a mediator at lea&s;t, to compromi&s;e the quarrel which they were not in a condition to maintain. Henry wi&s;hed for his return with the &s;ame eagerne&s;s, in full expectation of his adding &s;trength and importance to the royal cau&s;e; but he was extremely confounded, when he understood that Edward loadly blamed him for the violation of his oath; and his confu&s;ion was re|doubted by the reunion of the earls of Leice&s;ter and Glouce&s;ter, who now agreed to an hearty reconciliation, as the only expedient that could prevent the ruin of both, and &s;wore a &s;econd time to the Statutes of Oxford. The party of the barons being thus fortified, they gave the king to under&s;tand, that unle&s;s he would voluntarily remove from his per&s;on tho&s;e evil coun&s;ellors, who had given him &s;uch pernicious advice, they would find means to effect that removal by compul&s;ion. Henry, who had ra&s;hly embarked in this enterprize during a gu&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion, had by this time relap&s;ed into his native perplexity and irre|&s;olution; and, as he could not determine upon what an&s;wer he ought to make, he took no notice of the me&s;&s;age, but remained in the Tower, from an appre|hen&s;ion that his per&s;on would not be &s;afe in any other habitation. His fears, however, waxing &s;tronger and &s;tronger every day, he lived in the utmo&s;t ter|ror, and with a view to encrea&s;e the number of his parti&s;ans publi&s;hed the pope's bull, which ab&s;olved him from the obligation of his oath; an impru|dent &s;tep, by which he forfeited all the regard of the nation, and furni&s;hed his enemies with a plau&s;ible pretence for repre&s;enting him as a per&s;on, upon who&s;e faith and &s;incerity no dependence could be placed. The barons, who had hitherto hoped to accommodate matters before they &s;hould come to an open rupture, now laid a&s;ide all re&s;traint, and contrived a &s;cheme for &s;urprizing him at Winche&s;ter, to which city he had lately repaired on the faith of a ne|gotiation;

but, being appri&s;ed of their de&s;ign, he withdrew again to the Tower, from whence he &s;ent orders into all the counties to change the magi|&s;trates appointed by the four and twenty; and the&s;e directions filled the whole kingdom with confu&s;ion. The barons began to take effectual mea&s;ures for op|po&s;ing the king's de&s;igns, and engaged the governors of the Cinque-Ports to equip a fleet of &s;hips to &s;uccour the coa&s;t, and prevent his being &s;trengthened by foreign reinforcements.</P>

<P>Every thing &s;eemed to portend an immediate civil war, though both parties were afraid to plunge the nation into &s;uch a gulf of calamity, and each indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;ought to fix the odium of this di&s;&s;ention upon the other. At length the king of the Romans offered his mediation, which being accepted, he prevailed upon his brother to declare he would confirm the Statutes of Ox|ford, and at the &s;ame time, per&s;uaded the barons to relax in tho&s;e articles which were the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable to Henry. Not that they unanimou&s;ly agreed<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1262.</NOTE> to this qualification. The earl of Leice&s;ter prote&s;ted again&s;t the peace, alled|ging that they could never &s;afely confide in the profe&s;&s;ed &s;incerity of a prince who broke through the mo&s;t &s;acred ties for his convenience; and having made this declaration he retired to France. Several other barons expre&s;&s;ed their di&s;|like to the articles, but &s;uffered them&s;elves to be over-ruled by the majority, rather than run the ri&s;k of being reproached as the authors of inte&s;tine commo|tion; and by this treaty, the tranquility of England &s;eemed to be happily re|e&s;tabli&s;hed: yet, under this appearance of peace, the embers of di&s;cord &s;till glowed, &s;o as in a little time to bur&s;t out into a flame, that reged with un|common violence. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>After the ratification of this agreement, Richard, king of the Ro|mans, re-vi&s;ited Germany, upon a pre&s;&s;ing invitation of the princes, who &s;up|po&s;ed he had, by this time, recruited his finances, and was in a condition to feed their venality. Henry him&s;elf took this opportunity of the pacification, to go in per&s;on and regulate the affairs of Guienne, and was &s;eized with a dan|gerous di&s;temper at Bourdeaux, which detained him on the continent much longer than he had propo&s;ed to &s;tay, when he departed from England. Ri|chard, earl of Glouce&s;ter, dying in the mean time, his &s;on Gilbert made a voyage to Guienne to receive the inve&s;titure of the earldom; but Henry was &s;o irritated again&s;t Richard, that the &s;on was obliged to undergo the trouble of a tedious &s;ollicitation, and even pre&s;ent him with a con&s;iderable &s;um of money, before he could obtain his reque&s;t. During the king's ab&s;ence, the friends of Leice&s;ter, who&s;e turbulence and ambition no conce&s;&s;ions could appea&s;e or &s;a|tisfy, renewed their cabals, and endeavoured to re-unite the party which had been divided by the la&s;t accommodation. This talk was the le&s;s difficult, as Glouce&s;ter's death delivered him from the oppo&s;ition of a powerful rival, and as the king had furni&s;hed them with a plau&s;ible pretext, for complaining that he had not yet confirmed the Statutes of Oxford. The earl no &s;ooner under|&s;tood that his emi&s;&s;aries had &s;et the party in motion, than he returned to Eng|land, where his pre&s;ence revived the courage and animo&s;ity of all tho&s;e who had &s;ub&s;cribed the articles contrary to their own inclination; and the king re|ceiving intelligence of their mea&s;ures embarked for England immediately, in order to anticipate their de&s;igns: but before his arrival, the barons had con|certed a plan for &s;ecuring them&s;elves from all the bad effects of his incon&s;tancy.

<P>H$nry's co$rage was elevated upon this occa&s;ion, by a&s;&s;urances of &s;up|port to which th$y were as yet &s;trangers. During his re&s;idence in Guienne, he had engaged the king of the Romans and prince Edward in his intere&s;t: this la&s;t ha$, under pretence of a&s;&s;i&s;ting at a tournament in Paris, made &s;ome levies of foreign troops, which were brought over to England by that young prince, and led again&s;t Llewellyn, prince of Wales, who had made incur&s;ions into the Engli&s;h territories. The Wel&s;h prince was &s;uppo&s;ed to act in concert with the confederated barons, as he confined his depredations to the lands be|longing to Roger de Mortimer, and other noblemen who adhered to the king.<NOTE PLACE="marg">$$.

From this expedition he returned to London; and being de&s;titute of money to pay his forces, he marched at the head of a &s;trong detachment to the hou&s;e of the Templars, from whence he carried off ten thou&s;and pounds &s;terling belong|ing to the citizens, who had there depo&s;ited it as in a place of &s;afety.

Pope Urban, con&s;idering England as an exhau&s;ted fund, from which he could drain no more money, re&s;olved to play the &s;ame game with France, touching the crown of Sicily, and actually entered into a negotiation with Charles, count of Anjou, brother to the French king, a nobleman w$om he propo&s;ed to elevate to the Sicilian throne. To prepare Henry for this change $n his re&s;olution, he wrote a long letter to him, in which, after having re|proached him with his neglecting to fulfil his promi&s;e, he declared that he<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$t.

<P>Overtures of accommodation had been made by the moderate part of the nation, to prevent the quarrel between the king and the malecontents from proceeding to extremities; but their endeavours proving ineffectual, from the ob&s;tinacy of both parties, who &s;hifted the blame from each other, the earl of Leice&s;ter fearing that tho&s;e delays &s;erved only to debauch his parti&s;ans, re&s;olved to engage them beyond a power of retracting, by commencing ho&s;tilities with|out further he&s;itation. What quickened his re&s;olution was the indu&s;try of the king's party, who had exacted an oath of fealty to his &s;on Edward from all the citizens of London; and, in a parliament held at We&s;tmin&s;ter, all the nobility had &s;worn to maintain the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, except Gilbert de Clare, earl of Glou|ce&s;ter, who was a profe&s;&s;ed adherent of Leice&s;ter, and refu&s;ed to take the oath in the face of the parliament. Henry, alarmed at this refu&s;al, began to dread an in&s;urrection, and i&s;&s;ued out writs to all the &s;heriffs, enjoining them to de|mand
<PB N="527" REF="5360">
an oath from all per&s;ons at their county courts, implying that they would &s;tand by the king with their lives and fortunes, and after his death &s;up|port his &s;on Edward in his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne of his father. The prince had repaired in per&s;on to the i&s;le of Shepey, where he convened the barons of the Cinque-Ports, who &s;ubjected them&s;elves to the &s;ame oath at his de&s;ire; though the&s;e obligations were not at all binding on either &s;ide; for as the pope had more than once ab&s;olved the king of oaths which he pretended to have taken on compul&s;ion, &s;o now the inferior clergy, who were unanimou&s;ly in the intere&s;t of the barons, removed the &s;cruples o$ the people, and exhorted them to join in the defence of their liberties, again&s;t the tyranny of a king ruled by in&s;olent and rapacious foreigners.</P>

<P>The commonalty were thus inflamed to a degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m, while Leice&s;ter &s;eeing them ripe for his purpo&s;e, convoked his barons at Ox|ford, where they re&s;olved to maintain the &s;tatutes by force of arms, and cho&s;e the earl for their general. They had already levied &s;ome troops, which were now a&s;&s;embled, and augmented to a prodigious number. Peter, bi&s;hop of Hereford, a native of Burgundy, who had rendered him&s;elf odious to the clergy by oppre&s;&s;ing them in the Sicilian affair, was now the fir&s;t who $elt the re&s;e$$ment of the revolters; they &s;eized and impri&s;oned him in Erde&s;ley ca&s;tle, plundered his effects, and de&s;troyed his farms. The Italian eccle&s;ia&s;tics were pillaged and turned out of their livings: Geoffrey de Langley, Roger de Mortimer, and all the other noblemen who had oppo&s;ed the power of the four and twenty, &s;aw their lands and hou&s;es cruelly ravaged; and the $ury of the commons was in an e&s;pecial manner levelled again&s;t Simon de Walton, bi|&s;hop of Norwich, and John Man&s;el ju&s;ticiary, who had executed the pope's bulls for ab&s;olving the nation from the oath to ob&s;erve the provi&s;ions of Ox|ford. The earl of Leice&s;ter, having made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Glouce&s;ter, Worce&s;ter, and Bridgnorth, advanced about Mid&s;ummer towards London, with the royal &s;tandard, carried before him, and &s;ubduing all the king's ca&s;tles in his way, provided them with garri&s;ons and governors devoted to his in|tere&s;t. Henry at this time re&s;ided in the Tower; prince Edward lodged at Clerkenwell, de&s;titute of friends and money; and the city of London had de|clared for the barons, under the influence of Thomas Fitz-Th$mas the may$r, a &s;taunch adherent to Leice&s;ter. The populace formed them&s;elves into a&s;&s;ocia|tions again&s;t all foreigners, whom they per&s;ecuted with the utmo&s;t cruelty and malice; and prince Edward retired with his French knights to Wind&s;or, where he endeavoured to a&s;&s;emble a body of forces, with which he might be able to take the field again&s;t the barons. The queen thinking her&s;elf un&s;afe from the fury of the multitude, re&s;olved to follow her &s;on by water, and ac|cordingly went on board of a barge at the Tower; but as &s;he approached Lon|don-bridge, &s;he was in&s;ulted in the mo&s;t brutal manner by the populace, who, not contented with reviling her in the mo&s;t reproachful terms, endeavoured to &s;ink her boat and de&s;troy her li$e, by throwing a prodigious quantity of &s;tones into the ve&s;&s;el when the rowers attempted to pa&s;s through one of the arches; &s;o that &s;he was obliged to return to the Tower, which &s;he reached with great danger and difficulty, and was from thence conveyed to the palace of the bi&s;hop<NOTE PLACE="marg">M.

<P>This peace, which was proclaimed in London on the twenty-&s;e|cond day of July, was very di&s;agreeable to prince Edward, who could not bear to &s;ee the royal prerogative laid under &s;uch re&s;trictions. He had repaired to Bri&s;tol, with a view to provide the ca&s;tle of that place with a good garri&s;on and other nece&s;&s;aries for a vigorous defence, in ca&s;e the negotiation &s;hould not &s;ucceed; and he ordered the inhabitants to furni&s;h all the nece&s;&s;ary &s;tores and provi&s;ion at their own expence. The minds of the people being already irri|tated again&s;t his father, they were &s;o incen&s;ed at this arbitrary demand that a &s;edition en&s;ued; and Edward was fain to take refuge in the ca&s;tle, where he was immediately inve&s;ted. Unprovided as he was with men and ammunition, he had recour&s;e to a &s;tratagem, by which he delivered him&s;elf from the fury of the enraged populace. He de&s;ired to &s;peak with the bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, to whom he declared his intention was to e&s;pou&s;e the party of the barons; but that he wanted fir&s;t to try whether or not he could per&s;uade his father to grant them &s;atisfaction without coming to extremities. He therefore propo&s;ed that the bi&s;hop &s;hould interpo&s;e his influence with the populace, that he might have liberty to go and execute his de&s;ign; and he de&s;ired the bi&s;hop would accom|pany him in &s;uch a laudable undertaking, to direct him with his advice, and be an eye-witne&s;s of his conduct. The prelate, &s;atisfied with this declaration, repre&s;ented to the citizens, that it was of the greate&s;t detriment to the common|weal, to detain the prince at &s;uch a juncture: the blockade was immediately rai&s;ed; and Edward &s;et out for London, accompanied by the un&s;u&s;pecting bi&s;hop. When they arrived at Egham, the prince clapped &s;purs to his hor&s;e, and rode full &s;peed to the ca&s;tle of Wind&s;or, in which he thought him&s;elf &s;ecure; but the prelate, provoked at his e&s;cape and equivocation, proceeded to London, and complained of his behaviour to the barons, who re&s;olved to be&s;iege him immediately. Edward, knowing the place was not provided for a regular &s;iege, was no &s;ooner apprized of their march, than he rode forth to meet the earl of Leice&s;ter, in hope of amu&s;ing him with a negotiation, by which he might be allowed to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ca&s;tle; and he had a conference at King&s;ton with that nobleman, who did not chu&s;e to grant the conditions upon which he in&s;i&s;ted: he ther fore attempted to return, but found him&s;elf

arre&s;ted, and obliged to accept of &s;uch terms as the earl was plea&s;ed to pro|po&s;e. The ca&s;tle was delivered into the hands of the barons; the garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting wholly of foreign troops, was conducted to the &s;ea-&s;ide and em|barked for their own country, after their equipage had been &s;hamefully plun|dered. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron.

<P>Mean while the king, at the publication of the peace, had quitted the Tower, and repaired to his palace at We&s;tmin&s;ter, where he inwardly repined at the triumph of the barons, who did not u&s;e their &s;ucce&s;s with moderation. Hugh D' E&s;pen&s;er was created ju&s;ticiary; the &s;eals were given to Nicholas de Ely, while the earl of Leice&s;ter, at the head of his army, committed outrages with impunity, and in effect governed all England. His pride and in&s;olence had rai&s;ed him a number of enemies among the nobility, and now the people loudly murmured again&s;t the rapine and oppre&s;&s;ion which his &s;oldiers exerci&s;ed under his cognizance. They complained to the king, who could not redre&s;s their grievances; though, in order to prevent their taking arms in their own defence, they were amu&s;ed with hopes of receiving &s;atisfaction from the next parliament, which met in September. During this &s;hort &s;e&s;&s;ion, the charter for confirming the Oxford provi&s;ions was read in St. Paul's church; guardians of the peace were appointed all over the kingdom; a re&s;olution was taken to admini&s;ter ju&s;tice with punctuality for the future; and as Leice&s;ter refu&s;ed to make re&s;titution, the ca&s;e of the &s;ufferers was referred to the con&s;ideration of the en&s;uing parliament. Lewis, king of France, with a view to reconcile Henry and his barons, &s;ummoned this prince, together with the earl of Lei|ce&s;ter and other noblemen who enjoyed e&s;tates in his dominions, to meet him in the a&s;&s;embly of the e&s;tates at Boulogne, to deliberate on the coronation of his &s;on, and an expedition to Pale&s;tine, in which he propo&s;ed to embark. The barons would not con&s;ent to the king's departure until he had promi&s;ed in wri|ting, and upon the oath of Sir Geffrey Gatelin, that he would return within a week after Michaelmas. Then committing the government to the charge of Hugh D' E&s;pen&s;er, he took &s;hipping at Dover, with the queen, the two princes, and a great number of the nobility, and arrived in &s;afety at Boulogne, where Lewis endeavoured to per&s;uade the barons to de&s;i&s;t from their encroach|ments upon the prerogative, which had produced &s;o much di&s;turbance in their country, and &s;eemed &s;o &s;ubver&s;ive of all order and &s;ubordination. But Leice&s;ter, elated with his power and &s;ucce&s;s, rejected all propo&s;als of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and returned abruptly to England. He was in a little time followed by Henry, who left his queen in France, that &s;he might not be expo&s;ed to &s;uch in&s;ults as<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann. St. Aug.

<P>When the parliament met at We&s;tmin&s;ter, the earl appeared with a &s;trong body of Londoners; and as the original four and twenty governors were by this time partly dead, and partly converted to the king's intere&s;t, he re&s;olved to &s;upply their places with tho&s;e who adhered to the party of the ba|rons: but the people, whom he had di&s;obliged by his arrogance and tyranny, joining with Henry's friends, formed a &s;trong oppo&s;ition to his mea&s;ures; and di&s;putes ran high in parliament, when prince Edward, on pretence of vi&s;iting his wife, &s;urpri&s;ed Wind&s;or, to which the king next day retired, attended by &s;everal earls and barons, who had promi&s;ed to &s;tand by him with their lives and for|tunes. Henry called another parliament at Reading, where it could not be

overawed by the mil$tia of London. Leice&s;ter and his barons refu&s;ed to go thither; and the king, a&s;&s;embling a body of forces, marched directly to Do|ver, and tried to &s;urprize the ca&s;tle; but he mi&s;carried in the attempt, through the vigilance o$ Richard de Grey, the governor, who was a parti&s;an of the earl of Leice&s;ter. This recommencement of ho&s;til$ties furni&s;hed the malecontents with an handle to depreciate the character of Henry, whom they repre&s;ented as a per&s;on bound by no ties of agreement or accommodation; and they accu&s;ed him of a de&s;ign to introduce foreign troops to en&s;lave the &s;ubjects of England. In order to obviate the effects of this imputation, the king i&s;&s;ued a writ, to the citizens of London, and afterwards to all the &s;heriffs of England, declaring t$at he neither had nor would invite foreigners into the realm; charging the people to refu&s;e payment of any illegal taxes that might be laid upon them by t$e rebellious barons, and forbidding them to march out of their counties with|out his &s;pecial mandate: he likewi&s;e ordered the inhabitants of London to<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> remove the earl of Leice&s;ter and his followers from the city, where they had fixed their head-quarters.</P>

<P>Mean while, being baffled in his expectation at Dover, he vi&s;ited the Cinque-Ports; and having obliged the barons to renew their oath of fealty, advanced with his army towards London, where he &s;till had a good number of adherents, though the majority of the common people were in the intere&s;t of the barons. Le$ce&s;ter, hearing of his approach, took po&s;t in Southwark to oppo&s;e his entrance into the capital; and the king in his march was joined by prince Edward from Wind&s;or with a &s;trong body of forces; &s;o that he was now greatly &s;uperior in number to his adver&s;aries. He re&s;olved therefore to attack Leice&s;ter in his quarters; and his friends in London undertook to pre|vent that nobleman's retreat into the city. They accordingly locked up the bridge gates, and threw the keys into the river, while the royal army proceeded to the a&s;&s;ault. The earl, finding him&s;elf precluded, was obliged to &s;tand upon the defen&s;ive and maintain the engagement, until the populace, being informed of his &s;ituation, broke down the gates and barricadoes, and poured in va&s;t num|bers to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; &s;o that the king and prince Edward were fain to re|treat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$. W$$tmen.</NOTE> and Leice&s;ter entered London in triumph. The faction produced other overtures for an accommodation, and a truce was concluded, during which both parties agreed to refer their difference to the arbitration of the French king; and the reference was confirmed by the oaths of the king, barons, and all the principal per&s;ons concerned in the quarrel. Henry him&s;elf, with prince Ed|ward and &s;everal members of his council, &s;et out immediately for France, and were followed by the chiefs of the other party, except the earl of Leice&s;ter, who was prevented from going abroad on this occa&s;ion by a fall from his hor&s;e, in which his thigh$bone was fractured. Lewis accepted the office of arbitrator; and having heard the cau&s;e, in an a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates at Amiens,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$$. $h. 1264.</NOTE> decreed that the Statutes of Oxford &s;hould be annulled; that the king &s;hould recover all his rights and prerogatives, and have the liberty of appointing all the great officers of the crown; and that foreigners &s;hould be deemed capable o$ enjoying po&s;ts and dignities as well as Engli&s;h; but he added a clau&s;e, im|porting that his award &s;hould have no effect to the prejudice of the privileges which had been granted to the Engli&s;h be$ore the parliament of Oxford. The barons con&s;idered this &s;alvo as a manife&s;t contradiction, affirming that the

<P>The king was &s;carce returned from France, when Leice&s;ter &s;ent his two &s;ons Henry and Simon de Montfort with a &s;trong body of forces to ra|vage the lands of Roger de Mortimer; and afterwards being joined by Lle|wellyn, they reduced the ca&s;tle of Radnor: another party, commanded by Ro|bert Ferrers, earl of Derby, advanced to Worce&s;ter; and after &s;everal a&s;&s;aults taking the city, abandoned it to plunder. Edward, marching to the relief of Mortimer, &s;ubdued &s;everal ca&s;tles belonging to Humphry de Bohun, and pur&s;ued the two Montforts to Glouce&s;ter, where they &s;ued for a truce, which they obtained by the mediation of the bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter; before the expi|ration of which another treaty was brought upon the carpet at Brackley, in pre|&s;ence of John de Valence, the French amba&s;&s;ador: but the parties could not agree upon the articles. The &s;trength of the barons lay in the middle of Eng|land, where the earls of Leice&s;ter and Derby po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great e&s;tates; be&s;ides the city of London and the adjacent counties, which were greatly influenced by the earl of Glouce&s;ter. The king's intere&s;t prevailed in the north, in the Marches of Wales, and in the We&s;t, which was generally attached to the king of the Romans. As for London, it was &s;till governed by Thomas Fitz-Thomas, whom the populace elected from one year to another, contrary to all former precedents. It was under his au&s;pices that the citizens formed an a&s;&s;ociation to maintain their liberties again&s;t the arbitrary mea&s;ures of the king, and &s;up|port to the utmo&s;t of their power the intere&s;t of the confederated barons. All the people in the city, above twelve years of age, &s;wore to ob&s;erve this a&s;&s;o|ciation, which was &s;igned by the mayor and commons of London on one part, and by the earls of Leice&s;ter, Glouce&s;ter, and Derby, Hugh le D' E&s;pen&s;er, the chief ju&s;ticiary, and fourteen barons on the other; and in a little time the barons of the Cinque-Ports acceded to the &s;ame engagement. The populace were then divided into different bands; cho&s;e Thomas de Pievele&s;don for their con&s;table, created Stephen Bukerel their mare&s;chal; and obliged them&s;elves, on hearing the &s;ound of the great bell in St. Paul's, to come forth armed by day or by night, to follow the banners of the&s;e chieftains. Under &s;uch conductors, they made incur&s;ions into the neighbourhood of London, pillaging and de|&s;troying the hou&s;es and lands belonging to the king of the Romans and other noblemen of the king's party. In the week before Palm-Sunday, they broke open the hou&s;es and &s;hops belonging to the Jews, plundered their effects, &s;trip|ped them &s;tark naked, kept them in cu&s;tody for &s;ome hours, and then ma&s;&s;a|cred above five hundred of that wretched people, under the immediate di|rection of a powerful baron John Fitz-John, who with his own hand mur|dered Koh Ben Abraham, the wealthie&s;t Hebrew in England; and &s;eizing all his trea&s;ure divided it between him&s;elf and the earl of Leice&s;ter. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch$.

<P>The conferences for the peace having broke up, and the commi&s;|&s;ioners for the barons returned to London; the king &s;ummoned all his mili|tary tenants to attend him at Oxford, and he was joined by a very con&s;idera|ble body of forces from the north, commanded by John Comin, John Baliol lord of Galloway, Robert de Brus lord of Anandale, John de Vaux, Henry de Percy, and other noblemen from the Scotti&s;h border. With the&s;e he
<PB N="532" REF="5410">
marched to Northampton, where he under&s;tood a great number of barons had rendezvou&s;ed, in order to reinforce the earl of Leice&s;ter. Henry being refu&s;ed admittance, broke down a weak part of the walls; and Simon dc Montfort &s;allying out, was taken pri&s;oner by prince Edward, after his hor&s;e had fallen upon him. This accident di&s;concerted the a&s;&s;ociates in &s;uch a manner, that they threw down their arms, and &s;ubmitted to the mercy of the king, who afterwards made him&s;elf ma$ter of Leice&s;ter, Nottingham, Tutbury, and over|run<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. Paris. Brad$.</NOTE> the counties of Derby and Stafford, ravaging the lands belonging to his adver&s;aries. The earl of Leice&s;ter had begun his march from London to join the forces rendezvou&s;ed at Northampton; but, hearing of their di&s;a&s;ter, he retreated to the city, which he fortified with great diligence. Having taken this precaution, he re&s;olved to be&s;iege the ca&s;tle of Roche&s;ter, in which the earl of Warenne commanded for the king, though the earl of Arundel and &s;e|veral other noblemen were in the place. When he advanced to Strode, he found the bridge over the river Medway broke down, and the other &s;ide de|fended by a pali&s;ado and brea&s;twork, well manned with the inhabitants, deter|mined to oppo&s;e his pa&s;&s;age: but, he filled a ve&s;&s;el with combu&s;tibles, and &s;etting them on fire, pa&s;&s;ed the river under favour of the &s;moke. Having thus taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town, he inve&s;ted the ca&s;tle, which he would in all pro|bability have reduced, had not the king, in order to make a diver&s;ion, ad|vanced towards London. This motion alarmed the earl &s;o much, that he re|turned immediately to that city, leaving a &s;mall body of troops at Roche&s;ter, to block up the ca&s;tle. The&s;e were ea&s;ily defeated by the king, who now marched acro&s;s the country to the relief of the earl of Warenne. After having gained this advantage, he took the ca&s;tle of Tunbridge, and directing his route to Winchel&s;ea, compelled &s;ome of the barons of the Cinque-Ports to renew their oath of homage, while the re&s;t put to &s;ea, and intercepted all &s;upply of provi&s;ion from abroad, except &s;uch as were intended for the u&s;e of the male|contents. From Winchel&s;ea the king marched into Su&s;&s;ex, and fixed his quarters in the convent of Lewes, while prince Edward took up his lodging in the ca&s;tle.</P>

<P>Leice&s;ter being by this time reinforced by a body of fifteen thou|&s;and Londoners, re&s;olved to hazard a deci&s;ive engagement; and with that view, began his march towards the place where the king's army was encamped. He halted about two leagues from Lewes; and that he might throw the odium of whatever mi&s;chief &s;hould happen upon Henry, he &s;ent a re&s;pectful me&s;&s;age to the king, declaring that he and his followers had not taken up arms with a view to renounce their allegiance, but merely to remedy the di&s;orders of the government; he therefore conjured his maje&s;ty to concur with them in that &s;alutary work, prote&s;ting that he &s;hould find them as obedient as tho&s;e &s;yco|phants, who, under the pretext of re&s;pectful &s;ervice, &s;ought his ruin, in at|tempting, by their infamous calumnies, to alienate his affection from his faith|f$l $word$ This remon&s;trance gave &s;uch offence to prince Edward, and the king o$ the Romans, that they an&s;wered it with reproach and defiance; which th$ ba$o$s r$$orted with intere&s;t, renouncing their allegiance, and branding the king $word$ as an enemy to the nation. Both &s;ides now prepared for battle with th$ utmo&s;t rancour of animo&s;ity; and the earl of Leice&s;ter advanced to the neighbourhood of Lewes, where he found Henry's troops ready to give
<PB N="533" REF="5420" MS="Y">
him a warm reception. The royal army was formed in three divi&s;ions; prince Edward commanded on the right, the king of the Romans was po&s;ted in the left wing, and Henry him&s;elf remained in the centre. The barons were divided into four bodies: the fir&s;t was conducted by Henry de Montfort, &s;on of the ge|neral; the earl of Glouce&s;ter commanded the &s;econd; Simon, earl of Leice&s;ter, was at the head of the third; and the fourth, con&s;i&s;ting of Londoners, extended to the left, under the direction of Nicholas Seagrave. The battle was beg$n by prince Edward, who attacked the London militia with &s;uch fury, that they could not &s;u&s;tain the charge, but gave way, and fled immediately with great precipitation. He was &s;o tran&s;ported with the de&s;ire of revenging the in&s;ult they had offered to his mother, that he pur&s;ued them four miles from the field of battle, making a terrible &s;laughter. While he made this imprudent u&s;e of his victory, the earls of Leice&s;ter and Glouce&s;ter obtained the &s;ame advantage over Henry and the king of the Romans: the left wing was almo&s;t wholly cut in pieces, the king of the Romans with John Comyn, Robert de Brus, and other noblemen, being taken pri&s;oners; but the centre made a very gallant re&s;i&s;tance, being animated by the example o$ Philip Ba&s;&s;et, who per$ormed miracles of valour, until he was overpowered with numbers, after having received four and twenty wounds: the king him&s;elf was &s;lightly hurt and his hor&s;e killed under him, before he retired to the priory of Lewes, where he fell into the hands of the enemy. The royal army was totally routed when prince Edward returned from the pur&s;uit; and his followers were &s;truck with &s;uch con&s;ternation, that the earl of Warenne, W. de Valence, Guy de Lu&s;ignan, and Hugh Bigod, fled with &s;even hundred men to Peven&s;ey, where they em|barked for the continent. This defection di&s;abled prince Edward from execu|ting his fir&s;t re&s;olution, of falling upon the victors while they were yet di&s;per&s;ed in the pur&s;uit and pillage; at the &s;ame time it enabled the earl of Leice&s;ter to reduce his forces into &s;ome order, in ca&s;e he &s;hould be attacked. Perceiving, however, that they were unwilling to engage, he amu&s;ed Edward with propo|&s;als of accommodation, until he had &s;ent &s;ome detachments to cut off his re|treat; and the prince finding him&s;elf entangled in the &s;nare, was fain to &s;ubmit to whatever was propo&s;ed. The negotiation la&s;ted but a few minutes; and the treaty was concluded on the&s;e conditions: The Statutes of Oxford &s;hall be punctually ob&s;erved, though under &s;uch qualifications as may be judged pro|per by four bi&s;hops or barons appointed in parliament: If the&s;e four commi&s;|&s;ioners cannot agree, they &s;hall be referred to the arbitration of the count of Anjou, brother to the king of France, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by four French noblemen: And Edward him&s;elf, with his cou&s;in Henry &s;on to the king of the Romans, &s;hall<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

<P>This convention, which was called the Mi&s;e of Lewes, being &s;ettled, orders &s;ub&s;cribed by the king were &s;ent to the governors of all the ca&s;tles in which the barons who had been taken at Northampton were kept, to re|lea&s;e the pri&s;oners; and the garri&s;on of Tunbridge was di&s;banded.

who adhered to the king$ as fa&s;t as he could en&s;nare them into captivity. Writs were i&s;&s;ued in the king's name, forbidding all per&s;ons on the &s;evere&s;t pe|nalti$s to wear armour, without a &s;pecial licence from his maje&s;ty, which was granted to none but his own creatures: he obliged the king to commit the guardian&s;hip of all the counties to per&s;ons whom he him&s;elf nominated, and to deliver up all the royal towns and ca&s;tles; and then he re&s;tricted him to clo&s;er confinement: prince Edward was &s;ent pri&s;oner to Wallingford, but<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$$$r $word$ I Wykes.</NOTE> afterwards removed with his brother Henry to Dover ca&s;tle. As the chief aim of the barons in agreeing to the articles at Lewes was to &s;ecure the per&s;on of prince Edward, they never thought of executing the convention; on the contrary, they concerted a new plan of government, to be authorized by a parliament which they intended to a&s;&s;emble in the king's name about Whit|&s;untide. This &s;tep, however, was attended with &s;ome difficulties. They did not chu&s;e to &s;ummon any of the oppo&s;ite party; and they fore&s;aw that a parliament compo&s;ed wholly of their own creatures, would be thought defi|cient in point of legal authority. They therefore contrived a method to ren|der it more general and authentic. They compelled the king to &s;ign com|mi&s;&s;ions, appointing in every county certain officers or magi&s;trates, under the title of Con&s;ervators, for pre&s;erving the privileges of the people; and the&s;e being adherents of the barons, were inve&s;ted with a very exten&s;ive authority. Then the king &s;igned new writs to the&s;e con&s;ervators, commanding them to appoint four knights in every &s;hire, to &s;it and repre&s;ent it in the en&s;uing par|liament; and from this aera mo&s;t writers date the origin of that right which the commons have to &s;it in the great council of the nation, &s;ince the Norman conque&s;t. The parliament, packed in this manner, of members entirely de|voted to the barons, did not fail to approve the plan of government, which was projected to the following purpo&s;e: that the parliament &s;hould nominate three commi&s;&s;ioners of undoubted &s;agacity and di&s;cretion, impowered to chu&s;e a council of nine noblemen, to who&s;e care the admini&s;tration of pub|lic affairs &s;hould be entru&s;ted; and that the&s;e nine coun&s;ellors might be changed occa&s;ionally, with the con&s;ent of the king and the commi&s;&s;ioners: that in ca&s;e of di&s;agreement in opinion among the three commi&s;&s;ioners, touching the choice of the coun&s;ellors, the di&s;pute &s;hould be determined by the majo|rity: that the deliberations of the nine &s;hould be executed with the approbation of &s;ix of the number; but if that could not be procured, the affairs &s;hould be referred to the determination of the three great commi&s;&s;ioners: that the king &s;hould have power to di&s;mi&s;s or change the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners, with the con&s;ent of the barons; and that the nomination of all public officers &s;hould be at the di&s;po&s;ition of the nine coun&s;ellors: and the&s;e regulations &s;hould prevail until<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

The three commi&s;&s;ioners were the earls of Leice&s;ter and Glouce&s;ter, and the bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter; who con|tinued to govern the kingdom upon this new model, after having extorted the approbation of the king and prince Edward, by threatening both with per|petual impri&s;onment.</P>

<P>The queen, who re&s;ided in France, no &s;ooner heard of the un&s;or|tunate battle of Lewes, than &s;he began to borrow a &s;um of money to rai&s;e forces and equip a fleet, for relea&s;ing her &s;on and hu&s;band. An infinite num|ber of &s;old$ers of fortune flocked from Germany, Burgundy, and other coun|tries,

to Damme in Flanders, which was the place of rendezvous &s;he had ap|pointed; and at the &s;ame time the king of France was employed in &s;etting on foot a mighty armament, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to be intended again&s;t the barons of England, who had &s;o in&s;olently rejected his award. Leice&s;ter, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with this notion, obliged Henry to write a letter to Lewis, de&s;iring that prince would de&s;i&s;t from his martial preparations, and interpo&s;e his good offices in effecting a &s;olid peace between the crown and the barons. As the king of France paid very little regard to this addre&s;s from a prince in actual im|pri&s;onment; king Henry repeated his remon&s;trance, intreating that he would not &s;end or &s;uffer any of his &s;ubjects to come over to England, le&s;t &s;uch a &s;tep might be prejudicial to his &s;on Edward, and to his nephew Henry, who were ho&s;tages in the power of the barons; and reinvolve the kingdom in blood&s;hed and confu&s;ion. As Lewis had, in a letter to Henry, pre&s;&s;ed him to &s;end over amba&s;&s;adors to Boulogne, in order to di&s;cu&s;s the reference to which both &s;ides had agreed in the convention of Lewes, the king of England gave him to under&s;tand, that his chief coun&s;ellors were gone to take &s;ecurity from &s;ome lords of the Marches; but, if he would &s;end a &s;afe-conduct, his amba&s;&s;adors &s;hould be at Boulogne about the middle of Augu&s;t.</P>

<P>The noblemen of the Wel&s;h marches had declared openly again&s;t the proceedings of the la&s;t parliament; and Leice&s;ter had marched to that country, in order to &s;uppre&s;s them entirely, or compromi&s;e matters in &s;uch a manner as would prevent dome&s;tic di&s;turbances, while the nation was threatened with a foreign inva&s;ion. He accordingly reduced their ca&s;tles, and ravaged their lands, until they were obliged to give ho&s;tages for keeping the peace; then he returned towards London to oppo&s;e the de&s;cent of the enemy. He had i&s;&s;ued out writs in the king's name, &s;ummoning all the military te|nants to appear in arms on the third day of Augu&s;t at London: he demanded a certain number of armed infantry from every hamlet, according to its &s;ize, while the cities and borroughs were required to provide hor&s;e as well as foot, with maintenance for forty days, at the common expence of the inhabitants. Writs were likewi&s;e i&s;&s;ued to all the ports, cities, and towns, in Norfolk and Suffolk, to rai&s;e forces, and equip ve&s;&s;els, under the direction of Hugh le D' E&s;pen&s;er the new ju&s;ticiary, who undertook to guard that part of the coa&s;t, while the earl of Leice&s;ter took charge of the fleet fitted out by the Cinque|ports, to &s;creen the &s;outhern parts from inva&s;ion. But the fears of a de&s;cent<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot. Parl. 48.

But this was not the only apprehen&s;ion that di&s;turbed the barons in the enjoyment of their power. Cardinal Guido arrived at Boulogne, with orders from the pope to denounce eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ures again&s;t the earls of Leice&s;ter, Glouce&s;ter, Norfolk, and their adherents, unle&s;s they would immediately abjure the Statutes of Oxford, re&s;tore the king to the full enjoyment of his royal prerogative, and &s;et prince Edward and his cou&s;in at liberty. The barons had forbid the legate to enter the kingdom, on pain of death; and he had in his turn publi&s;hed an admonition at Boulogne, requiring them to give him admittance before a certain day; otherwi&s;e he would excommunicate them nominally, and lay their lands under an interdict. Then they thought proper to amu&s;e the cardinal, by &s;ending

<P>Hitherto Leice&s;ter had proceeded with uninterrupted pro&s;perity. He obliged Henry to confirm Thomas Fitz-Thomas in the mayoralty of Lon|don, and re&s;olved to reduce the lords of the Wel&s;h marches, who were &s;till aver&s;e to his admini&s;tration, and had begun to take mea&s;ures for reducing his exorbitant power. The&s;e were Roger de Mortimer, James Audeley, Roger de Leyburn, Hamon l'E&s;trange, Roger de Clifford, and Hugh de Truble|ville, again&s;t whom he now marched, carrying the king along with him as a &s;anction to the undertaking. They had &s;ecured or broken down all the bridges on the Severne; &s;o that he could not pa&s;s the river, until Llewellyn, his ally, made a diver&s;ion in his favour, by falling upon the lands of tho&s;e noble|men. Finding them&s;elves thus hemmed in between two enemies, they were obliged to &s;ubmit, and were pardoned on condition of delivering up their ca&s;tles, together with the cu&s;tody of their lands, to Simon earl of Leice&s;ter; who likewi&s;e received of prince Edward the ca&s;tle and county palatine of Che&s;ter, which he committed to the care of his &s;on Simon; and a peace be|tween Wales and Che&s;hire was immediately concluded, at Hawarden.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1265.</NOTE> The barons, who had taken up arms again&s;t the king on account of his arbitrary government, could not but be jealous of Leice&s;ter, who reigned as ab&s;olutely as any tyrant upon earth. The earl of Glouce&s;ter, in particular, was jealous of his power, and re&s;ented the arrogance of his behaviour. He looked upon him as an ambitious adventurer, making large &s;trides towards the throne, under the &s;pecious pretext of patrioti&s;m; and fore&s;aw infinitely more mi&s;chief in the &s;way of &s;uch an u&s;urper, than ever could be dreaded from the mi&s;conduct of a weak prince like Henry. He had already impri&s;oned the earl of Derby in the Tower, for &s;ome pretended mi&s;demeanor; and be|haved in &s;uch a cool indifferent manner to the earl of Glouce&s;ter, as &s;eemed the prelude of &s;ome &s;uch de&s;ign again&s;t that nobleman, who therefore began to take mea&s;ures for his own defence. He favoured the malecontents on the Wel&s;h marches, and employed all his influence in rai&s;ing a faction to counter|balance the power of Leice&s;ter. Simon perceived his drift, and i&s;&s;ued a pro|clamation commanding all tho&s;e who had lately taken arms again&s;t the e&s;tab|li&s;hed government, to retire into Ireland; but, in&s;tead of obeying this order, they repaired to the lands of the earl of Glouce&s;ter, who afforded them &s;helter and protection. Mean while the enemies of Leice&s;ter, in&s;inuated on all oc|ca&s;ions,

that the cruelty with which he treated the king and his brother, with their &s;ons, too plainly denoted the pernicious de&s;ign which he harboured in his bo&s;om; and the&s;e reports began to have &s;uch effect upon the minds of the nation, that he found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to take &s;ome &s;teps for his own exculpation. With this view, he convoked a parliment, on pretence to con|cert mea&s;ures for &s;etting prince Edward at liberty; and at this a&s;&s;embly every &s;hire was repre&s;ented by two knights, and two burge&s;&s;es appeared for every city and borough in the kingdom. When the parliament met at We&s;tmin|&s;ter, Leice&s;ter accu&s;ed Glouce&s;ter of having granted &s;helter and protection to the lords of the Wel&s;h Marches, and demanded ho&s;tages for his fidelity; but the earl, in&s;tead of complying with his demand, quitted the place abrubtly, and retired to the we&s;t, with a &s;trong body of his followers, among whom was John Giffard, one of the brave&s;t noblemen in England, whom Leice&s;ter had attempted to oppre&s;s. As this parliament had been convoked chiefly on account of prince Edward, the bi&s;hops of London, Worce&s;ter, and Chiche&s;ter, drew up a convention, containing the conditions of his relea&s;e, and the king was obliged to &s;wear to the performance. The prince parted with his palace at We&s;tmin&s;ter to Peter de Montfort; ceded his ca&s;tle of Bri&s;tol to the earl of Leice&s;ter; and promi&s;ed, in writing, to deliver all his ca&s;tles in the Marches of Wales, for three years, to &s;uch per&s;ons as &s;hould be named by the king's council; to per&s;uade or compel the noblemen of the Marches to &s;ubmit to the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration; to oppo&s;e the introduction of foreigners; to ob&s;erve the agreement, on pain of forfeiting his e&s;tate; to give up the cu&s;tody of all his ca&s;tles for the term of five years; and to con&s;ent that his cou&s;in Henry &s;hould be detained till the end of the year, as an ho&s;tage for his behaviour, in ca&s;e the kingdom &s;hould be invaded. This convention being &s;igned and ratified, Edward was brought into We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall, where the in&s;trument was read in public; and nine bi&s;hops joined in excommunicating all tho&s;e who &s;hould pre&s;ume to violate the agreement. Then the prince was declared free and at liberty, though like his father &s;urrounded by a &s;trong guard, which had particular orders to watch his motions; writs were i&s;&s;ued for exacting a new oath of allegiance from all the people of England; and the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch.

<P>All tho&s;e who were di&s;gu&s;ted at the pride, in&s;olence, tyranny, and extortion of Leice&s;ter, having now found a leader and patron in the earl of Glouce&s;ter, who was one of the mo&s;t powerful and popular noblemen of his time, rai&s;ed &s;uch a clamour again&s;t Simon, as &s;eemed to portend a very dan|gerous oppo&s;ition. In order to avert this &s;torm, he is &s;aid to have formed the de&s;ign of taking away the life of his antagoni&s;t; and for this purpo&s;e, de&s;ired his &s;on Henry de Montfort to proclaim a tournament at Northampton, to which all knights were invited without di&s;tinction. He knew the ambition and im|petuo&s;ity of young Glouce&s;ter, who had, on a former occa&s;ion, expre&s;&s;ed an eager de&s;ire of trying his dexterity and manhood again&s;t Henry; and he did not doubt but that the &s;ame eagerne&s;s &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, and would animate him to ap|pear in the li&s;ts; in which ca&s;e, it was &s;uppo&s;ed he would never have returned alive.

upon the young knights and gentlemen a&s;&s;embled at the tournament, to proceed immediately to the Marches of Wales, in hope of taking Glouce&s;ter by &s;ur|prize: that nobleman, however, was upon his guard, had already fortified his ca&s;ties, and engaged in a league with Mortimer and the other lords for their mutual &s;ecurity. Leice&s;ter arriving at Hereford, with the king and prince in his retinue, and perceiving his rival well prepared for his defence, propo&s;ed a treaty of accommodation, which was recommended to both parties by Henry, and managed by the bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter and &s;ome other noblemen, whom Glouce&s;ter knew to be devoted to the intere&s;t of his adver&s;ary; he therefore had no intention to depend upon any politic reconciliation, and amu&s;ed the managers with a negotiation, until the mea&s;ures he had concerted with Morti|mer were ripe for execution. He &s;aw no way &s;o effectual for humbling Lei|ce&s;ter, and preventing the dangerous con&s;equences of his ambition, as that of effecting the e&s;cape of prince Edward, and &s;upporting him with all his power and influence. He by means of his brother Thomas de Clare, who at|tended Edward as a companion, communicated his re&s;olution to that prince, who readily embraced the occa&s;ion of retrieving his liberty, and promi&s;ed to act according to the directions he received. In pur&s;uance of the&s;e, he one day rode forth in the afternoon to divert him&s;elf in Widmar&s;h near Hereford, ac|companied by his u&s;ual guards and attendants, and made running matches be|tween them until he had tired all their hor&s;es: in the evening the lord Croft appearing on the a&s;cent of Tulington-Hill, and waving his bonnet according to agreement, the prince mounted a &s;teed of incomparable fleetne&s;s, which he had re&s;erved for the purpo&s;e, and bad adieu to his keepers, who pur&s;ued him for<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> &s;ome time, until they &s;aw him received by Roger de Mortimer, with a party of men, who had concealed them&s;elves in a neighbouring wood, and now con|ducted him to the ca&s;tle of Wigmore.</P>

<P>Edward's deliverance was no &s;ooner known, than the lords of the Marches took to their arms, reduced all their own ca&s;tles which they had formerly given up, and over-ran all the country from Hereford to Che&s;ter. The earl of Glouce&s;ter took the field with all the forces he could a&s;&s;emble, and broke down the bridges of the Severne, to prevent the excur&s;ions of Leice&s;ter. Great numbers flocked from all quarters to &s;erve under the banners of prince Edward, who was joined by John Giffard, at the head of a &s;urpri&s;ing multitude of hor&s;e and foot, who followed the fortunes of that gallant chieftain; and he was reinforced by William de Valence, John earl of Warenne, and Hugh Bigod, who had a few days before landed at Pembroke, with a body of &s;tout warriors enli&s;ted upon the continent. Leice&s;ter was not a little confounded when he heard of Edward's e&s;cape; though at fir&s;t he believed the prince had fled into Pembroke&s;hire, in order to take &s;hipping for France; but he was &s;oon undeceived to his &s;orrow, when Edward, at the head of a numerous army, ad|vanced to Worce&s;ter, and found means to cut off his retreat into England. Montfort being thus caught in the &s;nare he had laid for the earl of Glouce&s;ter, &s;urrounded by enemies and at a great di&s;tance from London, which had hi|therto &s;upplied him with re&s;ources, &s;ummoned all the military tenants of the crown to meet the king at Glouce&s;ter with the utmo&s;t di&s;patch; but this order was ill obeyed, and before any body of militia appeared in his behalf, the city of Glouce&s;ter and the ca&s;tle were taken by prince Edward. Then Leice&s;ter had recour&s;e to his ally Llewellyn, prince of North Wales, who fell upon the lands
<PB N="539" REF="5480">
of the earl of Glouce&s;ter in Glamorgan, and &s;ent a body of Wel&s;h troops to join Montfort. Thus reinforced, he marched to Monmouth, whither he was fol|lowed by John Giffard, who challenged him to battle: but he declined an en|gagement and proceeded to Newport, where he expected to be &s;upplied with &s;hips from Bri&s;tol, according to the order he had &s;ent to that city, that he might tran&s;port his army thither, as he could not otherwi&s;e pa&s;s the Severne. The earl of Glouce&s;ter, however, blocking up the mouth of the Avon with a fleet of gallies, no ve&s;&s;el could come round to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance: and now he &s;aw him&s;elf in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s; for prince Edward had come up with his army to Newport, and waited only for day-light to begin the attack.</P>

<P>In this emergency, he decamped &s;ilently in the middle of the night, which, being dark and tempe&s;tuous, favoured his e&s;cape into North Wales; from whence he afterwards retreated through woods and over moun|tains to Hereford, where he fixed his quarters, till he &s;hould find an opportu|nity of cro&s;&s;ing the Severne. Mean while he ordered his &s;on Simon, who was engaged in the &s;iege of Peven&s;ey-ca&s;tle, to relinqui&s;h that enterprize, and march immediately to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In obedience to this order he returned to Lon|don, where he a&s;&s;embled a &s;trong body of troops, including &s;ixteen bannerets and their followers, and began his march for the banks of the Severne. In his route he took Winche&s;ter by &s;torm, was admitted without oppo&s;ition into Ox|ford and Northampton, from whence he proceeded to Kenilworth, where his forces lay encamped in the mo&s;t carele&s;s &s;ecurity. A man and a woman, who acted as &s;pies for Edward in Simon's army, &s;ent an account of their defencele&s;s &s;ituation to that prince, who advancing immediately from Worce&s;ter, found Montfort's troops a&s;leep, and took them all pri&s;oners without re&s;i&s;tance: his &s;oldiers were enriched with a prodigious booty, and he numbered among his captives, the earl of Oxford, W. de Montchen&s;y, Baldwin Wake, Hugh Neville, Adam de Neumarche, and many other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction. When he returned from this excur&s;ion to Worce&s;ter, he was informed that Leice&s;ter had pa&s;&s;ed the Severne in his ab&s;ence, encamped at Kem&s;ey, from whence he moved in the night to Eve&s;ham, in hope of being able to join his &s;on next day at Kenilworth. Edward having received intimation of his de&s;ign, put his army in motion about &s;un-&s;et, giving out that his march was directed to Bridg|north, that he might deceive the &s;pies of the enemy: he accordingly took that route, in which having proceeded about two or three miles, he faced about for Eve&s;ham, which he inve&s;ted in the morning before &s;un-ri&s;e.</P>

<P>Leice&s;ter at fir&s;t mi&s;took the prince's army for the forces under his &s;on, who&s;e di&s;a&s;ter he had not yet learned; but he was &s;oon undeceived by the banners of Glouce&s;ter and Mortimer, and a&s;cending a &s;mall eminence to ob&s;erve their number and di&s;po&s;ition, was &s;o &s;truck with both, that he could not help exclaiming, <Q>&startq;Lord have mercy upon our &s;ouls, for our bodies are doomed to de&s;truction.&endq;</Q> He did not, however, abandon him&s;elf to unmanly de&s;pair; but &s;eeing him&s;elf &s;urrounded on all &s;ides, drew up his men in a com|pact circle, and exhorted them to fight like brave men, who&s;e lives and liber|ties were at &s;take: at the &s;ame time he obliged the king to put on armour, that he might not be known, and expo&s;e him&s;elf in the front of the battle. Edward attacked his troops with incredible fury, &s;o that the Wel&s;h could not &s;u&s;tain his fir&s;t on&s;et, while Glouce&s;ter charged with equal intrepidity in ano|ther
<PB N="540" REF="5490">
quarter. Notwith&s;tanding the incredible efforts made by tho&s;e two impe|tuous commanders, and the precipitate flight of the Wel&s;h, Leice&s;ter main|tained the battle from two o'clock in the afternoon till night, with &s;urpri&s;ing ob&s;tinacy. The king was wounded in the &s;houlder, and in the mo&s;t imminent hazard of his life, when calling out he was Henry of Winche&s;ter their king, he was &s;aved by Adam de Mouhaut. Prince Edward hearing his voice, ran imme|diately to the &s;pot, and conducted him to a place of &s;afety; and before he re|turned Leice&s;ter was &s;lain. His hor&s;e had been killed under him; and when he demanded quarter as he fought on foot, it was refu&s;ed by his adver&s;aries, who told him there was no quarter due to &s;uch a traitor. His &s;on Henry did not long &s;urvive him; and his troops, &s;eeing their principal leaders killed, were &s;o di&s;heartened that they made no further re&s;i&s;tance: for by this time Hugh le D'E&s;pen&s;er, Ralf Ba&s;&s;et of Sapcote, Peter de Montfort, John de Beauchamp, W. de Mandeville, Guy de Bardolfe, and all the barons, had &s;hared the fate of the earl, except John Fitz-John, Nicholas de Seagrave, Henry de Ha&s;tings, Guy de Montfort, Humphrey de Bohun junior, and &s;even or eight others who were taken pri&s;oners. In a word, all the people of con&s;equence in that army, were either &s;lain or taken; a great number of gentlemen and common &s;oldiers fell in the field; and prince Edward obtained a complete victory,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. Paris. Ch. Abingd. Bradv.</NOTE> which did not co&s;t him above three lives of any con&s;ideration. The body of Leice&s;ter, being &s;ound among the dead, was barbarou&s;ly mangled and treated with indignity by Roger Mortimer, who ordered the head to be cut off and &s;ent to his wife, as a te&s;timony of his having completed this revenge upon his adver&s;ary.</P>

<P>The face of affairs was intirely changed by the i&s;&s;ue of this battle, which was fought on the fifth day of Augu&s;t, in the neighbourhood of Eve&s;|ham. Tho&s;e who were formerly per&s;ecuted became oppre&s;&s;ors in their turn, and the victors u&s;ed their &s;ucce&s;s with an uncommon rigour. The king, who was naturally vindictive and rapacious, re&s;olved to &s;acrifice his enemies to tho&s;e unkingly pa&s;&s;ions. He convoked a parliament at Winche&s;ter, in which the effects of the rebels were confi&s;cated for the u&s;e of the crown; and it was re&s;olved to be&s;iege and de&s;troy the city of London, which was always attached to the malecontents. The citizens being informed of this determination, and under&s;tanding they were adjudged to have forfeited their privileges, &s;ubmit|ted to the mercy of the king, who deprived London of its chains, barricadoes, gates, magi&s;trates, and charter, which the inhabitants were obliged to redeem with a large &s;um of money; and Fitz-Thomas the mayor, with &s;ome of his $word$ was impri&s;oned, until they purcha&s;ed a pardon with the be&s;t part of their &s;ub&s;tance. The confederated barons were per&s;ecuted with the utmo&s;t &s;e|verity: their effects were &s;eized, and their per&s;ons hunted about from one place to another, until they were almo&s;t driven to de&s;pair. Simon de Montfort, elde&s;t &s;on of the earl of Leice&s;ter, had endeavoured to &s;ecure a protector in the per|&s;on of Richard, king of the Romans, who was a pri&s;oner under his care in the ca&s;tle of Kenilworth, from whence he now relea&s;ed him without ran&s;om; and many other captives of note, who had been taken in the battle of Lewes, were &s;et at liberty in the &s;ame manner: but Simon reaped no immediate advantage from his genero&s;ity.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XXXI.</HEAD>
<P>The king was implacable; and prince Edward re&s;olved to extir|minate the very &s;eeds of oppo&s;ition: Simon therefore quitted the ca&s;tle of Kenil|worth, in which he left a good garri&s;on, and a&s;&s;embling the wreck of his fa|ther's army, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;le of Axholme in Lincoln&s;hire, which he fortified as a retreat for him&s;elf and his friends, who joined him to a con&s;ider|able number. Edward, judging it altogether improper to allow &s;uch a body<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1266.</NOTE> of enemies to maintain their footing in the middle of the kingdom, marched thither at the head of his forces, and found the place &s;trongly fortified both by art and nature: neverthele&s;s he carried on his attacks with &s;uch vigour, that the be&s;ieged, after an ob&s;tinate defence, were obliged to &s;urrender upon a&s;&s;urance of life and limb; but with re&s;pect to their e&s;tates, they agreed to &s;ub|mit to the judgment of the king of the Romans and prince Edward. In con|&s;equence of this capitulation, Montfort appeared before the king's court, where he found a warm advocate in the king of the Romans, who a&s;&s;ured Henry, that immediately after the battle of Eve&s;ham, the garri&s;on of Kenilworth would have murdered him, had not Montfort &s;aved his life at the hazard of his own, and &s;et him at liberty without ran&s;om; he therefore begged that he would indulge him with a free pardon. This reque&s;t was vehemently oppo&s;ed by the earl of Glouce&s;ter; and as they did not chu&s;e to di&s;oblige that nobleman, it was re&s;olved in council that Montfort &s;hould quit the kingdom, and enjoy an allowance of five hundred marks a year, provided he would &s;urrender the ca&s;tle of Kenilworth; though it was not in his power to fulfil this article, be|cau&s;e the garri&s;on would not obey his order. All the other rebels found in the i&s;le of Axholme were pardoned, upon &s;wearing that they would never carry<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch. T. Wykes Ch. $word$ Mat. Pari$.</NOTE> arms for the future again&s;t the king; an oath which was very ill ob&s;erved in the &s;equel. And thus the tranquillity of the kingdom was re&s;tored.</P>

<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e tran&s;actions, the queen, who had re&s;ided two years in France, arrived in England, accompanied by Ottoboni, cardinal of St. Adrian, the pope's legate, fraught with &s;everal bulls from Clement X. con|firming tho&s;e of his predece&s;&s;or again&s;t Leice&s;ter and his adherents, whom he now excommunicated whether dead or living: he likewi&s;e laid an interdict upon their lands; granted to Henry one year's tenth of all the revenues of the clergy; and &s;ummoned the bi&s;hops of Worce&s;ter, Chiche&s;ter, Winche&s;ter, and London, to appear before him, to an&s;wer for their crimes, in &s;upporting Leice&s;ter in all his rebellious mea&s;ures, and di&s;regarding the cen&s;ures which the pope had denounced again&s;t that arch rebel and his adherents. The bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter profe&s;&s;ed penitence, was ab&s;olved, and died; but the other three were &s;ent to Rome, in order to undergo &s;uch puni&s;hment as the p$$ &s;hould think proper to inflict. Mean while Simon de Montfort, who &s;eemed at fir&s;t pretty well &s;atisfied with his &s;ituation, withdrew privately from the prince's pa|lace, and joined a &s;et of pyrates belonging to the Cinque-Ports, who conferred upon him the command of their &s;hips, with which he pillaged all ve&s;&s;els that fell in his way; and as it plainly appeared that the&s;e pyracies were favoured by the inhabitants of the Cinque-Ports, the king &s;ent prince Edward to cha&s;ti&s;e them, not only for this inju&s;tice, but al&s;o for their continual attachment to the rebellious barons. He accordingly began his march for Winchel&s;ea, which he took by &s;torm; but the other ports &s;ubmitted, upon promi&s;e of a general<NOTE PLACE="marg">M.

<P>Though the barons had received a total overthrow at Eve&s;ham, and the king had in a manner de&s;troyed the roots of that confederacy, the peace of the kingdom was not yet perfectly re-e&s;tabli&s;hed; for the ca&s;tle of Kenilworth &s;t$$l held out again&s;t the royali&s;ts; and there was a body in arms in the northern counties, which committed depredations in defiance of his authority. He detached his nephew Henry, &s;on of the king of the Romans, again&s;t tho&s;e freebooters, whom he &s;urprized, defeated, and di&s;per&s;ed; but he could not &s;ecure the per&s;ons of their chiefs, who joining other malecontents, particularly tho&s;e who had been di&s;lodged from the i&s;le of Axholme, took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the $&s;le of Ely in Cambridge&s;hire, from whence they made incur&s;ions into the neighbouring counties.

<P>By &s;uch vigorous proceedings, all the little in&s;urrections and di&s;|turbances were quelled in different parts of England; but the malecontents &s;till kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;le of Ely; and Kenilworth ca&s;tle was maintained by Henry de Ha&s;tings and William de Pati&s;hulle, who confided &s;o much in the &s;trength of the fortification, the &s;tores of provi&s;ion and ammunition that were in the place, the bravery of the garri&s;on, that con&s;i&s;ted of &s;eventeen hun|dred men, and the promi&s;e of Simon de Montfort, who a&s;&s;ured them he would bring an army of foreigners to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, that they would not li&s;ten to terms of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The king marched again&s;t this fortre&s;s in per&s;on, and &s;ummoned the governor to &s;urrender, who, far from obeying his citation, was &s;o barbarous as to cut off the hand of the pur&s;uivant who delivered the me&s;&s;age. The ca&s;tle was immediately inve&s;ted; but the garri&s;on was &s;o well provided, and made &s;uch a gallant defence, that it &s;eemed impo&s;&s;ible to re|duce it any other way than by famine. As the&s;e troubles in a great mea&s;ure aro&s;e from confi&s;cating the e&s;tates of rebels, and be&s;towing them upon the king's adherents, Henry convoked a parliament in the town of Kenilworth, to miti|gate the ordinance which had been enacted on this &s;ubject; and it was de|creed in a new law, called the Dictum de Kenilworth, that all forfeited e&s;tates &s;hould be re&s;tored to the original owners, after a certain deduction for his ma|$e&s;ty's u&s;e, according to the nature of the tre&s;pa&s;s or delinquency of the pro|prietor. As for Henry de Ha&s;tings, he was, for his cruelty to the pur&s;uivant, fined in a &s;um equal to the revenue of his e&s;tate for &s;even years; and the earl of Derby, who had twice rebelled, was condemned to impri&s;onment for the &s;ame term, if he would not chu&s;e to throw him&s;elf altogether upon the king's mercy.

<P>The reduction of Kenilworth, and the pro&s;pect of &s;ubduing the rebels in the i&s;le of Ely, &s;eemed to efface all former misfortunes from the re|membrance of Henry; and though Edward had &s;worn, to the earl of Glou|ce&s;ter, when he fir&s;t e&s;pou&s;ed his cau&s;e, that he would u&s;e his be&s;t endeavours to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the antient laws, and drive the foreigners from the king's coun|cils, he now &s;eemed more intent upon reducing the malecontents than incli|nable to perform the articles of this obligation. As the affairs of Henry pro&s;|pered, both father and &s;on acted with le&s;s re&s;traint, and made the le&s;s &s;cruple to extend the royal prerogative beyond the limits which the laws pre&s;cribed. It was not &s;o much with a view to augment the regal power, as to prevent the earl of Leice&s;ter from u&s;urping the throne, that the earl of Glouce&s;ter had exerted him&s;elf in behalf of prince Edward; and now fore&s;eeing that &s;hould the malecontents be altogether oppre&s;&s;ed, the king would render him&s;elf in|tirely ab&s;olute, he thought it incumbent upon him to prevent &s;uch a calamity to the nation. With this view he demanded that the malecontents &s;hould be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their e&s;tates, according to the Dictum de Kenilworth: but Henry refu&s;ing to comply with the terms of his propo&s;al, he retired to his own e&s;tate on the frontiers of Wales; engaged in a treaty with Llewyllen, and &s;ome noblemen in the neighbourhood; and &s;ent promi&s;e of &s;uccour to the revolters of Ely. The court took umbrage at his ab&s;ence and preparations; but as he cloaked the&s;e la&s;t with the pretext of a quarrel with Mortimer, the king gave him&s;elf no trouble to appea&s;e the di&s;content of &s;uch a powerful noble|man, and bent all his thoughts towards the reduction of the rebels. He therefore a&s;&s;embled a parliament to concert mea&s;ures, and grant a &s;upply for this expedition; and as the earl of Glouce&s;ter did not appear, &s;ent &s;ome noblemen to per&s;uade him to come and take his place in the great a&s;&s;em|bly of the nation. They found him bu&s;ily employed in rai&s;ing troops; and when they expre&s;&s;ed their &s;urprize at &s;uch preparation, he a&s;&s;ured them tho&s;e levies were de&s;tined again&s;t his enemy Mortimer, and in a writing, &s;igned by his own hand, promi&s;ed that he would never take arms again&s;t his maje&s;ty. This obligation quieted the &s;u&s;picions of the king and parliament: they granted a &s;ub&s;idy for maintaining the war again&s;t the malecontents; and at the &s;ame time<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> defence in the fir&s;t attacks abated his courage in &s;uch a manner, that he re|solved to wa$$ the arrival of prince Edward, who was then engaged in an exped$tion again&s;t John de Ve$$y, a northern baron, who had &s;eized the ca&s;tle of Alnewick, which however the prince compelled him to &s;urrender at di&s;|cretion. While the king and his &s;on were thus employed, the earl of Glou|ce&s;ter put him&s;elf in motion with the troops he had a&s;&s;embled on his own e&s;tate and in the principality of Wales; and marched with &s;uch expedition, that he arrived in the neighbourhood of London before it was known whether he act|ed for the king or in behalf of the malecontents. The magi&s;trates who had been appointed by the king were doubtful of his de&s;ign, and con&s;ulted with the pope's legate, whom Henry had left in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Tower. The car|dinal advi&s;ed them to admit the earl, with a few attendants; and for &s;ome days he remained quiet, without betraying the lea&s;t hint of his intention: but John D' Eguille arriving with a party of rebels from the north, and taking up his quarters in Southwark; and he being followed by another party from Ely, under the command of Robert de Willoughby, the magi&s;trates, who could no longer mi&s;take his purpo&s;e, ordered the drawbridge to be drawn up, and the gates guarded for their own &s;ecurity. Things continued in this po&s;ture for a fortnight, during which the earl &s;ecured the inhabitants in his intere&s;t; then &s;eized the gates, and granted admittance to the troops of the malecontents. The populace cho&s;e a new &s;et of magi&s;trates; bulwarks and barbicans were erected between the Tower and the city; and Glouce&s;ter &s;ummoned the legate to &s;urrender that fortre&s;s. At fir&s;t he &s;tood upon the defen&s;ive; when all com|munication being cut off, &s;o that he could receive no &s;upplies of provi&s;ion, he excommunicated all in general who di&s;turbed the public peace, and laid an interdiction upon the churches of London. The&s;e cen&s;ures were totally di&s;re|garded; and when he &s;aw the earl making preparations to be&s;iege him in form, he was fain to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion. Glouce&s;ter having made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the Tower, no longer concealed his de&s;igns, but, on the contrary, publi&s;h|ed a manife&s;to, declaring that he had taken up arms to procure equitable con|ditions to the revolters; and that he would not lay them down until he &s;hould have obliged the king and prince Edward to perform their promi&s;es, which they had hitherto neglected.</P>

Then they advanced together towards Lon|don, and took po&s;t at Stratford, within three miles of that capital, where they were joined by a great number of people, de&s;irous of &s;ighting under the ban|ners of the prince, who was univer&s;ally beloved and admired for his valour. The earl of Glouce&s;ter was not a little di&s;appointed and chagrined when he under&s;tood how the royal army was continually reinforced; for, he had hoped that the whole kingdom would have e&s;pou&s;ed his cau&s;e, and that Henry would have been abandoned by his own forces; but now perceiving the royal army in|crea&s;ed to &s;uch a number, that he dur&s;t not hazard a battle, he remained within the walls of London, and re&s;olved to extricate him&s;elf by a negotia|tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$$.

<P>The troubles of the kingdom being thus appea&s;ed, the king<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

As the peace of England was now re&s;tored, prince Edward and his cou&s;in Henry received the cro&s;s from the hands of the legate, and their exam|ple was followed by the earls of Warwick and Pembroke, above one hundred and twenty knights, and an infinite number of inferior rank, inured to military &s;ervice during the war between the king and the barons. The tranquillity of the kingdom had been &s;ecured by certain regulations, e&s;tabli&s;hed in a late par|liament at Marlborough, known by the name of the Statute of Marlbridge.

The ceremony was performed with great pomp and &s;olemnity, the two kings bearing the relics on their &s;houlders, in pre&s;ence of all the prelates and nobility of the realm.

Yet his continence was prai&s;e-worthy, as well as his aver&s;ion to cruelty; for he contented him&s;elf with puni&s;hing the rebels in their effects, when he might have glutted his revenge with their blood.

<P>&sect; XLV. William I. may be &s;aid to have conquered the church as well as the &s;tate. Many &s;ees were filled with Norman prelates; many churches converted into lay-fees, and many abbeys be&s;towed upon the king's countrymen, to whom were appropriated the tythes of other churches held by the Engli&s;h. What|ever obligations William had to the pope, he under&s;tood his own importance too well to &s;uffer innovations of the court of Rome; he directed the conduct of his clergy in ca&s;es of a double election; nor could any eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ures of con&s;equence, be i&s;&s;ued without his warrant. The fir&s;t eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;ynod<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

The intention of this a&s;&s;embly was to depo&s;e Stigand, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who was accu&s;ed of holding that &s;ee and the bi&s;hopric of Winche&s;ter at the &s;ame time; of having worn, fir&s;t, the pall of Robert his predece&s;&s;or, and of having afterwards received one from Benedict X. who was an u&s;urper. The fir&s;t article was certainly an abu&s;e; for which, however, he did not de&s;erve privation: he pleaded that he only wore the pall of his predece&s;&s;or until ano|ther could be obtained for him&s;elf; and with re&s;pect to Benedict, that there was no other pontiff at that time in the papal chair. Notwith&s;tanding this defence, he was deprived of his bi&s;hoprics and thrown into pri&s;on, where he ended his days. Agilmar, bi&s;hop of the Ea&s;t-Angles, underwent the &s;ame fate.

This prelate, upon his promotion to the &s;ee of Canter|bury, impeached Wul&s;tan bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, before the &s;ynod, for in&s;uffi|ciency in his office; though the true cau&s;e of this pro&s;ecution was a claim put in by Wul&s;tan to certain lands which had been alienated from his &s;ee, when it was joined to that of York. The Saxon, however, made his claim good, and baffled all the arts of his antagoni&s;t. Thomas canon of Bayeux, was pro|moted to the archbi&s;hopric of York, and Walceline, one of William's chap|lains, to the &s;ee of Winche&s;ter: but the&s;e foreigners &s;oon quarrelled among them&s;elves.

The&s;e two prelates going afterwards to Rome to obtain the pall, were very differently received by his holine&s;s, who care&s;&s;ed Lanfranc, but deprived Thomas of his ring and pa&s;toral &s;taff, becau&s;e he was the &s;on of a prie&s;t; and he treated the bi&s;hop of Lincoln in the &s;ame manner for &s;imony; though they were afterwards re&s;tored by Lanfranc, whom the pope ve&s;ted with a legatine power for this and other purpo&s;es.</P>

<P>The di&s;pute about precedency between the two archbi&s;hoprics was now re&s;umed, and after a full hearing in an a&s;&s;embly of the clergy, decided in favour of Canterbury: the river Humber was fixed as the boundary between the two &s;ees, and the archbi&s;hop of York obliged to quit his preten&s;ions to the dioce&s;es of Lincoln, Litchfield, and Worce&s;ter. But it was decreed, that his juri&s;diction &s;hould extend over all the i&s;land to the north of the Humber. In a council held at Winche&s;ter, it was ordained, among other canons, that no bi&s;hop &s;hould hold two dioce&s;es; that the &s;acrament &s;hould not be admini&s;tred in beer, but in wine mixed with water; that dead bodies &s;hould not be buried in churches; and that chalices &s;hould not be made of wax or wood. About this time a certain penance was impo&s;ed upon every &s;oldier who had been in actual &s;ervice; and the pope's legate approved the ordinance, importing that a &s;oldier &s;hall do penance a year for every man he has &s;lain in battle; for every &s;ingle man he has &s;truck, forty days; and if he knows not the number of men he has &s;lain or &s;truck, he &s;hall do penance one day in every week, at the di&s;cretion of the bi&s;hop as long as he lives, or redeem it with perpetual alms, by build|ing or endowing a church.</P>

as an encroacher upon their privileges, remon&s;trated in &s;uch a manner, that the king would not allow the legate to exerci&s;e his authority in England. Henry had divers di&s;putes with the court of Rome on the &s;ame &s;ubject. Conon, legate in France, under the papacy of Pa&s;chal II. &s;ummoned the bi&s;hops of Nor|mandy to the councils which he convoked in that kingdom, and excommuni|cated them on their refu&s;al to obey his citation. Henry, incen&s;ed at the legate's pre&s;umption, &s;ent the bi&s;hop of Exeter with complaints to the pope, who thought proper to give the &s;atisfaction he demanded. This king being after|wards in Norm$ndy, the abbot An&s;elm, nephew to the archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury of the &s;ame name, pre&s;ented to him a commi&s;&s;ion, impowering him to exerci&s;e the legatine authority in England; and Henry con&s;ulting the bi&s;hops on this &s;ubject, they unammou&s;ly d$clared that this legation was contrary to the privileges of the Anglicane church.

He a&s;&s;embled a &s;ynod at London, touching the marriage of prie&s;ts; but, in the writs of &s;ummons it was expre&s;ly declared, that the council was convoked by the order and with the concurrence of the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. Altho' this legate knew his arrival was not at all agreeable to the Engli&s;h, he affected, in the exerci&s;e of his legation, an in&s;olence of deportment which not a little increa&s;ed their di&s;gu&s;t. He in&s;i&s;ted upon officiating in the church of Canter|bury, although he was not a bi&s;hop; and in the council at London he or|dered his &s;eat to be rai&s;ed like a throne, above the two archbi&s;hops and all the nobility of the kingdom. In the reign of Stephen, Alberic bi&s;hop of O&s;tia was received as the pope's legate in England, without oppo&s;ition, becau&s;e the king was &s;o precariou&s;ly &s;ituated that he dur&s;t not oppo&s;e the innovations of Rome. While this prince &s;at upon the throne, the pope inve&s;ted his brother Henry bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter with the legatine power, to the prejudice of Theobald archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. This di&s;tinction produced a quarrel be|tween the two prelates, from which the court of Rome derived great advan|tages; for, upon this occa&s;ion, both parties appealed to the Roman &s;ee, which be$ore that time had been very little troubled with Engli&s;h di&s;putes and $efe|rences. After a long conte&s;t, the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter was deprived of his legation by pope Cele&s;tin II. who conferred it upon his rival as a free gift of the holy &s;ee.

The&s;e expeditions furni&s;hed them with pretexts to intermeddle in all the affairs of Chri&s;tendom; to divert princes from other de&s;igns$ which were incompatible with the papal intere&s;t or ambition; to impo&s;e taxes on the clergy of different kingdoms; and to de&s;troy tho&s;e poten|tates who pre&s;umed to oppo&s;e their u&s;urpations; for they pretended that it was as nece&s;&s;ary for the glory of God, to exterminate heretics as to war again&s;t infidels; and as it was their peculiar prerogative to determine what was and what was not here&s;y, they had it always in their power to publi&s;h and preach up cru&s;ades again&s;t &s;uch princes as incurred their di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>

<P>After the murder of Thomas Becket, prince Henry, in his father's ablence, ordered Odo prior of Canterbury to proceed to a new election: and the prior making a voyage to Normandy to con&s;ult the king, was de&s;ired to u&s;e his intere&s;t in behalf of the bi&s;hop of Baycux, who did not, however, obtain that dignity. We have already ob&s;erved, in the hi&s;tory of Henry II. that the choice of the convent fell upon Roger abbot of Bec, who declined the honour; and then they cho&s;e Richard prior of Dover, again&s;t whom young Henry ap|pealed to the pope; &s;o that he was obliged to make a journey to Rome, where he was con&s;ecrated, and received the pall from his holine&s;s. This new arch|bi&s;hop<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1175.</NOTE> at his return convened a provincial &s;ynod at London; but Roger archbi&s;hop of York refu&s;ed to appear in this council, becau&s;e his cro&s;s was not allowed to be carried before him within the province of Canterbury; and the &s;ees of Lincoln, Che&s;ter, Worce&s;ter, and Hereford, were not con&s;idered as dioce&s;es annexed to the &s;ee of York. The clergy of this province demanded &s;atisfaction of the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury for excommunicating the clergy of St. O&s;wald in Glouce&s;ter, becau&s;e they would not &s;ubmit to him as their metropolitan; and the clergy of St. A&s;aph petitioned that their bi&s;hop Godfrey, who had been driven from his dioce&s;e by the commotions of the Wel&s;h, &s;hould be re&s;tored to his function. Godfrey however, who was guardian of the vacant abbey of Abingdon, re&s;igned the bi&s;hopric, and the king filled up the abbey with another per&s;on; &s;o that he found him&s;elf deprived of both livings. The decrees of this &s;ynod were levelled again&s;t the libertini&s;m of the clergy and &s;ymoniacal practices; enjoining the payment of tythes; regulating the number of prefaces in the &s;acred catalogue; the manner of admini&s;tering the euchari&s;t; and prohibiting private marriages, e&s;pecially between parties under the age pre&s;cribed by the canons. In the cour&s;e of the en&s;uing year, another &s;ynod was held at Northampton, to which Henry &s;ummoned the king of Scotland and his clergy to own the &s;uperiority of the Engli&s;h church. They accordingly appeared at the time appointed; and as each archbi&s;hop claimed this &s;uperiority, the Scot made a handle of their di&s;pute to refu&s;e the &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion; yet that he might not involve him&s;elf in a quarrel with Henry, he referred his cau&s;e to the determination of the pope, who &s;ent cardinal Vivian over to England, with power to di&s;cu&s;s and decide the controve&s;y. But the Scotti&s;h king perceiving that this legate was more bent upon extorting money than upon the arbitration of the difference, would not &s;uffer him to enter his country until he had &s;worn he would attempt nothing to the prejudice of his crown and kingdom. It was in the cour&s;e of this year that the indecent fray happened in a &s;ynod at We&s;tmin&s;ter, between the two archbi&s;hops, about pre|cedency, in pre&s;ence of Hugezun the pope's legate. We have already related that incident, and &s;hall only add, that by the interce&s;&s;ion of the king the two primates laid a&s;ide all animo&s;ity for five years, until the plea&s;ure of the pope &s;hould be known; and Alexander decreed, that neither metropolitan &s;hould claim precedency of the other, but according to the &s;eniority of their or|dination. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hov$den.

The Scotti&s;h clergy are &s;aid to have &s;ubmitted about this time to the archbi&s;hop of York as their metropolitan; but this dependency is ab&s;olutely denied by the writers and hi&s;torians of that country, who challenge the Engli&s;h to produce any authentic acknowlegement of this submi&s;&s;ion, or to prove that any Scotti&s;h prelate was then<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> con&s;ecrated by the archbi&s;hop of York, or his licen&s;e. The here&s;y of the Al|bigen&s;es now began to gain ground in France and England, notwith&s;tanding the king's endeavours; which proving ineffectual, they were excommunicated. Their tenets nearly re&s;embled tho&s;e that are at pre&s;ent profe&s;&s;ed by the pro|te&s;tants, though clouded over with the gloom of &s;uper&s;tition. The pope con|voked a lateran council to prevent abu&s;es ari&s;ing from the controverted elec|tions of popes; and a great number of prelates from England, Ireland, and Scotland, as well as from other countries, a&s;&s;i&s;ted at this a&s;&s;embly. It was here decreed that no pope &s;hould be deemed duly elected, without the concurrence of two thirds of the electing cardinals; that the heretics &s;hould be pro&s;cribed; that no per&s;on &s;hould be promoted to a bi&s;hopric, unle&s;s he was turned of thirty, and well recommended for his learning; that no benefice &s;hould be promi&s;ed away before a vacancy, or kept longer than &s;ix months vacant; that clergy|men &s;hould not intermeddle in &s;ecular affairs, nor parochial prie&s;ts enjoy plu|ralities; that bi&s;hops &s;hould maintain tho&s;e whom they have ordained, until they can be provided with livings; that Jews and Infidels &s;hall not be per|mitted to keep Chri&s;tian &s;laves; that u&s;urers, and tho&s;e who plundered people who had &s;uffered &s;hipwreck, &s;hould be held as excommunicated; that the re|tinue of archbi&s;hops &s;hould be limited to fifty hor&s;e, bi&s;hops to thirty, legates to five and twenty, and archdeacons to &s;even; that tilts and tournaments &s;hould be laid a&s;ide, on &s;evere penalties; that every cathedral &s;hould furni&s;h a &s;chool-ma&s;ter to teach the children gratis; that laymen &s;hould not grant tythes to one another; nor any clerk vi&s;it a nunnery without &s;ufficient cau&s;e. Imme|diately before this council, the abbot of St. Augu&s;tine's at Canterbury put him&s;elf and his &s;ociety under the protection of the pope, that he might be ex|empted from the profe&s;&s;ion of canonical obedience to the archbi&s;hop, who complained loudly of this encroachment upon his right, and wrote an ex|po&s;tulatory letter to his holine&s;s; in which he charges the court of Rome with a de&s;ign to &s;ubvert the power of the bi&s;hops in behalf of religious hou&s;es. This remon&s;trance had &s;uch an effect upon the pope, that although he granted the exemption to the abbot, it was clogged with a &s;alvo in favour of the arch|bi&s;hop's dignity and prerogative.</P>

<P>Geffrey the king's natural &s;on had been elected into the &s;ee of Lincoln, and enjoyed the revenues for &s;even years, without being con&s;ecrated; at la&s;t the pope offered him the alternative of receiving or relinqui&s;hing all
<PB N="557" REF="5660">
eccle&s;ia&s;tical preferment; and he accordingly re&s;igned his dioce&s;e into the hands of the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. A di&s;pute &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between that pre|late and the abbot of St. Augu&s;tine's, who pleaded an exemption from archi|epi&s;copal juri&s;diction, and refu&s;ed to produce his charters until he was expre&s;ly commanded by the pope; and then they appeared with &s;uch flagrant marks of forgery that no regard was paid to their contents. The bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter dying at this period, the metropolitan of Canterbury &s;eized the temporalities, in right of his &s;uperiority over that &s;ee; and his claim being allowed by Henry, who was then greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in Normandy, the archbi&s;hop filled the va|cancy with Walleran archdeacon of Bayeux. Pope Lucius being oppre&s;&s;ed by<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Vivian having &s;punged England and Scotland, had cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea to Ireland, where he laid the clergy under contribution, and even in&s;tigated the Iri&s;h to rebel again&s;t the Engli&s;h, who took the city of Downe while he re&s;ided in the place, and compelled him to take &s;anctuary in the cathedral: but, being furni&s;hed with pa&s;&s;ports from the court of England, he was treated with great re&s;pect, and af|terwards held a national council at Dublin, where he attempted to bring the church of Ireland to an entire conformity with that of Rome, and to exact money from the inhabitants. He was di&s;appointed however in both aims by the vigilance of the Engli&s;h government, and leaving that kingdom returned to Scotland.</P>

<P>As the &s;tate and church affairs were very much interwoven in this reign, we have in the civil hi&s;tory given a detail of the di&s;pute which happened between the monks of St. Augu&s;tine's and the &s;uffragans of Canterbury, about the election of a prelate to &s;ucceed Richard, together with Henry's de&s;ign of electing a &s;ociety of regular canons at Hackington, which was prevented by the pope's interpo&s;ition. Baldwin the new archbi&s;hop likewi&s;e formed a &s;cheme for bringing the monks of Chri&s;t-Church intirely under his &s;ubjection; but was baffled by their &s;uperior intere&s;t at the court of Rome. At Henry's death, the &s;ees of York, Winche&s;ter, Ely, Sali&s;bury, and London, were vacant;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1189.</NOTE> and at an eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;ynod held by Richard at Pipewell in Northampton|&s;hire, the archbi&s;hopric was conferred upon Geffrey, the king's natural brother, formerly elect of Lincoln; William Longchamp, chancellor and prime mi|ni&s;ter to Richard, was elected bi&s;hop of Ely; Winche&s;ter was be&s;towed upon Godfrey de Lucy; London was given to Richard, archdeacon of Ely; and Sali&s;bury to Hugh Walter, dean of York. Geffrey was obliged to pay a round &s;um to the king before he would approve of his election, and the arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury entered a claim to the privilege of giving him con&s;e|cration. This produced a di&s;pute that &s;till depended, when the cardinal of Anagni was &s;ent as legate by the pope, to adju&s;t the difference between the archbi&s;hop and the monks of Canterbury; but the king forbade him by a man|date to proceed farther than Dover, without his expre&s;s order. Yet when Ri|chard, in conjunction with the queen mother and the archbi&s;hops of Rouen and
<PB N="558" REF="5670">
Dublin, had effected a &s;ol$d accommodation, the legate was invited to Canter|bury. This was a revival of the former di&s;pute about the canonical obedience, building the church at Hackington, and forcing a prior upon the convent. By the pacification it was agreed that the church &s;hould be left unfini&s;hed, the prior laid a&s;ide, and the monks profe&s;s canonical obedience to the &s;ee of Can|terbury. The oppo&s;ition again&s;t Geffrey elect of York was now increa&s;ed; the bi&s;hops of Durham and Sali&s;bury prote&s;ted again&s;t the election, becau&s;e it was made in their ab&s;ence; the dean and trea&s;urer of York excepted to his per&s;on, becau&s;e he had been born in adultery, and concerned in blood&s;hed while he fought again&s;t the rebels in defence of his father's government. The&s;e prote&s;ts were followed by appeals to the pope, who impowered the legate to decide the affair. It was accordingly brought to a hearing, when he deter|mined in favour of the elect; the king prevailed upon his oppo&s;ers to with|draw their appeals, and the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury attending Richard in his expedition to Pale&s;tine, the di&s;putes concerning his con&s;ecration were removed. Baldwin dying at the &s;iege of Ptolemais, the king wrote to his mother in fa|vour of Hubert bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury, who likewi&s;e accompanied him in the cru&s;ade; and that prelate was cho&s;en as his &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the &s;ee of Canterbury. When Richard reterned, the clergy of York complained to the pope of their archbi&s;hop, whom they accu&s;ed of divers irregularities, and of di&s;couraging appeals to the court of Rome. His holine&s;s immediately granted a commi&s;|&s;ion to the bi&s;hop of Lincoln, the archdeacon of Northampton, and the prior of Pontefract, for trying the archbi&s;hop; and &s;u&s;pending him if guilty, unle&s;s he would in three months make his per&s;onal appearance at Rome. Geoffrey paid very little regard to this injunction, and as the bi&s;hop of Lincoln refu&s;ed to execute the pope's order, that pontiff &s;u&s;pended Geoffrey from all temporal and &s;piritual juri&s;diction.</P>

<P>Mean while Hubert archbi&s;hop of Canterbury was ve&s;ted with a le|gatine commi&s;&s;ion, by virtue of which he held an a&s;&s;ize and &s;ynod at York, where he enacted &s;ome canons to prevent and reform the avarice and corruption of prie&s;ts, as well as the practice of fal&s;e &s;wearing, again&s;t which they de|nounced<NOTE PLACE="marg">John&s;on'&s; Canons.</NOTE> the &s;entence of excommunication. After this progre&s;s the metropo|litan, as we have ob&s;erved in another place, erected a chapel at Lambeth, with a view to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ecular canons, according to the &s;cheme formerly projected at Hackington; but the monks of Canterbury having recour&s;e again to the &s;ee of Rome, the pope ordered him to de&s;i&s;t from his de&s;ign. Hubert had not &s;uch weight and influence with his holine&s;s at that time as he afterwards acquired under the &s;ucceeding reign, when Giraldus Cambren&s;is the hi&s;torian being elected bi&s;hop of St. David's, laid claim to the right of metropolitan over the &s;ees of Landaff, Bangor, St. A&s;aph, Che&s;ter, Hereford, and Worce&s;ter, and refu&s;ed to profe&s;s canonical obedience to the &s;ee of Canterbury; but Hu|bert's intere&s;t proved too powerful for Giraldus, who was obliged to renounce his election, and another was con&s;ecrated in his room. At the &s;ame time the di&s;pute between the archbi&s;hop and the monks was recon&s;idered and compro|mi&s;ed: he was allowed to build the chapel at Lambeth, but limited in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1200.</NOTE> number of canonries and in the value of the endowments. At the next national &s;ynod held at We&s;tmin&s;ter, &s;ome canons were made touching the celebration of bapti&s;m and the payment of tythes, which was always enforced in every
<PB N="559" REF="5680">
council; and all Templars, Ho&s;pitallers, or other religious, were forbidden to receive tythes from laymen, without the con&s;ent of the bi&s;hop. In the &s;uc|ceding year, one Eu&s;tace abbot of Flay, &s;uppo&s;ing that the Lord's day ought to begin at three o'clock in the afternoon of Saturday, and continue till Mon|day at &s;un$ri&s;ing, produced a forged letter pretended to be written by Chri&s;t him&s;elf again&s;t the practice of profaning the Sabbath, and found on the altar of St. Simeon at Golgotha near Jeru&s;alem. Though he him&s;elf contrived this impo&s;ture, his zeal got the better of his &s;en&s;es. In the actual belief that this letter was genuine, he preached all over England again&s;t the impiety of breaking the Lord's day, and wrought up his hearers to &s;uch a pitch of enthu&s;ia&s;m, that they looked upon him as an apo&s;tle; and all markets, fairs, and labour, which had been held or practi&s;ed on Sunday were now laid a&s;ide.</P>

<P>In the hi&s;tory of John's reign we have been &s;o circum&s;tantial in re|lating his di&s;putes with the pope, that very few eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs of any con|&s;equence remain to be recorded. The pope being de&s;irous of levying an ex|traordinary Rome&s;cot or St. Peter's penny, the bi&s;hops a&s;&s;embled a &s;ynod to<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Neverthele&s;s, a legate named Florentin convoked another council at Reading, upon the &s;ame &s;ubject; and as if the clergy had influenced the king's refu&s;al, he extorted from them a &s;ub|&s;idy in lieu of the extraordinary Rome&s;cot, which would have affected the whole kingdom. We have already mentioned the councils that were a&s;&s;embled to regulate the re&s;titution to the exiled bi&s;hops, after John's reconciliation with his holine&s;s; but we &s;hall take notice of the twelfth council of the lateran, held during this reign by pope Innocent III. at which four hundred and twelve bi&s;hops a&s;&s;i&s;ted. This a&s;&s;embly enacted four&s;core canons: one of which in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat.

It may be nece&s;&s;ary, however, to ob&s;erve, that the popes u&s;ed the &s;ame artifice in pa&s;&s;ing unpopular canons, which has been of late years frequently practi&s;ed to pa&s;s a mini&s;terial bill in parliament; they tacked them to a number of other u&s;eful laws, which no member could oppo&s;e without &s;ubjecting him&s;elf to the imputation of rai&s;ing ob&s;tacles to public utility. We likewi&s;e ob&s;erve with what indu&s;try the court of Rome endea|voured to e&s;tabli&s;h the celibacy of prie&s;ts; what difficulty they found in fixing that regulation, e&s;pecially in England, where we find married prie&s;ts, in the latter end of this reign, even a prelate the &s;on of a bi&s;hop; and in the time of Henry II. the pope expre&s;&s;ing his &s;urprize that the bi&s;hop of Ely had not gone to Rome to demand his confirmation, the Engli&s;h re&s;i|dent told his holine&s;s, the elect had an evangelical excu&s;e, for he had lately married a wife. We are told by Baronius, that a legate &s;ent into Poland by pope Innocent III. to e&s;tabli&s;h the celibacy of prie&s;ts, had &s;ucceeded in his commi&s;&s;ion; but that he ran the ri&s;k of his life, by endeavouring to &s;ettle the &s;ame cu&s;tom in Bohemia. There was another article of great importance to the popes, which they did not fail to labour at with the utmo&s;t a&s;&s;iduity. This was to give their ordinances or decretals the &s;ame authority which was in the canons of councils. One Gratian publi&s;hed a collection of decretals,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1150.</NOTE> containing all the ordinances which had been publi&s;hed to that time, that they might &s;erve as rules for the admini&s;tration of eccle&s;ia&s;tical ju&s;tice. To this collection was added a number of decrees made in the &s;equel, &s;o as to con&s;ti|tute a complete body of canon law. Raymond de Pignaford, penitentiary of Gregory IX. was employed to make this collection, which was intitled, The Second Part of the Canon Law; and to this he joined &s;ome con&s;titutions of councils, and deci&s;ions of doctors, po&s;terior to the period at which it begun. It was not only a &s;upplement, but al&s;o, in &s;ome places, an alteration of the anti$nt canon law: for example, it decrees that ba&s;tards cannot be admitted to eccle&s;ia&s;tical functions, without a di&s;pen&s;ation from the pope. Thus the court of Rome arrogated to it&s;elf the power of favouring ba&s;tards occa&s;ionally, though contrary to the antient con&s;titutions of councils. Indeed that court could not chu&s;e a more favourable conjuncture for publi&s;hing its decretals; for it was now at the very &s;ummit of its greatne&s;s. There was neither a prince or private per&s;on, who du$&s;t oppo&s;e the will of the pope when he was $word$ to be obeyed. He therefore enacted laws very often oppo&s;ite to tho$$ which had been formerly ob&s;erved. The civil law of England con|&s;idered children born before marriage, as illegitimate, even though their pa|rents &s;hould have been afterwards joined in wedlock; but the canon law legi|tim$ted all &s;uch children: and this very ordinance produced violent debates in the parliament a&s;&s;embled at Merton. <NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>The popes had no &s;ooner rendered them&s;elves ab&s;olute ma&s;ters of the church, than it was d$lug$d with an inu$dation of religious orders, which

$word$ be compared to different bands of an army, rai&s;ed to &s;upport the $word$ a$d grandeur of the Roman pontiffs. The council of the lateran had $span$ to prevent or reform this abu&s;e, by expre&s;sly forbidding the $span$ n$w order of monks. Neverthele&s;s, Dominick Gu&s;man, a $word$ who had long preached again&s;t the Albigen&s;es, formed the &s;cheme of a new order, under the name of the Friars Preachers, for which he de|manded the confirmation of pope Innocent III. That pontiff at fir&s;t made $word$ difficulty, on account of the prohibition; but he afterwards pretended to have had a cele&s;tial vi&s;ion, by which he was given to under&s;tand, that he could not take any &s;tep that would be more advantageous to the church. Neverthele&s;s, the order was not confirmed till the pontificate of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or Honorius, when it was in&s;tituted under the name of the Friars Preachers, or Preaching Brothers, becau&s;e the individuals were de&s;tined to preach again&s;t the heretics. They were likewi&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appellation of Domini|cans, from the name of their founder, and in France called Jacobins, from the &s;treet of St. Jaques, where they had their fir&s;t hou&s;e in Paris. They were intru&s;ted with the care of the inqui&s;ition, and rendered them&s;elves famous by the barbarities they committed again&s;t the pretended heretics: and they &s;ettled<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$ C$. $217.</NOTE> in England in a very little time after their in&s;titution. The order founded by Francis d'A&s;&s;i&s;i, was confirmed by the &s;ame pontiff, and, in the cour&s;e of the year that &s;ucceeded their confirmation, they were &s;ettled in England. The monks out of mode&s;ty a&s;&s;umed the name of Minor Brothers; and though, in the &s;equel, they were divided into different &s;ocieties, all of them owned St. Francis d'A&s;&s;i&s;i for their chief and founder. They were re&s;tricted, by their rules, from preaching or confe&s;&s;ing in any dioce&s;e, without the permi&s;&s;ion of the bi&s;hop. This re&s;triction, however, did not long continue: they repre|&s;ented to the pope, that many chri&s;tians were a&s;hamed to confe&s;s their &s;ins to their own pa&s;tors; that &s;everal per&s;ons &s;crupled to perform their duty, be|cau&s;e they knew the curates them&s;elves guilty of the &s;ame tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; and that tho&s;e prie&s;ts had not di&s;cretion to keep the &s;ecrets with which they were entru&s;ted. On the&s;e con&s;iderations, they de&s;ired and obtained a di&s;pen&s;ation for that rule of their order. The Dominicans and Franci&s;cans acquired &s;uch reputation for &s;anctity, that almo&s;t every per&s;on cho&s;e a director from one of tho&s;e orders; con&s;equently the churches they received, were very con&s;i|derable: for a long time, the popes were elected from one or other of the&s;e &s;ocieties; &s;o that, by their credit at the court of Rome, they frequently obtained effects belonging to other orders, on pretence of the nece&s;&s;ity for their being &s;ub&s;i&s;ted. They ama&s;&s;ed prodigious wealth from benefactions of devout people, even in their life-time, as well as from donations and legacies extorted from dying people, by the threats or promi&s;es of future mi&s;ery or<NOTE PLACE="marg">$n. $word$ 1244.</NOTE> &s;alvation. In a council held at Roche&s;ter, a new order of monks, called Cro&s;s-bearers, demanded permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ettle in England; and produced a bull from the pope, forbidding all per&s;ons what&s;oever to reproach or mole&s;t them, and empowering them to excommunicate tho&s;e who &s;hould violate that privilege. The &s;ynod did not think proper to grant their reque&s;t; but &s;ent them back, on pretence of adhering to the canon pa&s;&s;ed in the council of the lateran.</P>

<P>The mo&s;t remarkable eccle&s;ia&s;tics who lived in England from the conque&s;t to the death of Henry III. were the following: Aldred arch|bi&s;hop of York, who crowned William the Conqueror; he had been formerly bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter, and built the cathedral of that city: he was a pious and worthy prelate, and a great benefactor to the mona&s;tery of Beverley. Stigand archbi&s;hop of Canterbury was at fir&s;t very much re&s;pected by William the Conqueror, though he afterwards procured his depo&s;ition: this prelate, being deprived of his dignity, was thrown into pri&s;on, becau&s;e he refu&s;ed to di&s;cover the place where his trea&s;ure was depo&s;ited; he died in confinement, and, after his death, a &s;mall key was found hanging to his neck, together with a paper de&s;cribing the place where his wealth was concealed. Marianus Scotus, born<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1028.</NOTE> in Scotland, retired at the age of thirty, to the mona&s;tery of Cologne, from whence he was removed to the abbey of Fulde, where he wrote a chronicle, beginning at the creation, and ending in the year one thou&s;and and eighty|two of the chri&s;tian aera: the Scots were at that time very well received in Germany, where fifteen mona&s;teries were founded by a prince of their nation, who had &s;erved in the wars of Charlemagne, and all the abbots were natives of Scotland. Wul&s;tan bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter was renowned for his piety, and &s;aid to have worked miracles, both before and after his death: we have already ob&s;erved, that Lanfranc accu&s;ed him in a council of ignorance and incapacity: his chief merit &s;eems to have con&s;i&s;ted in an inoffen&s;ive life, and yet he had a con&s;iderable &s;hare of &s;elf-conceit; for when the monks, who attended him in his la&s;t moments, expre&s;&s;ed their affliction at the pro&s;pect of lo&s;ing &s;uch a pillar of the church, he bade them be of good cheer, for he &s;hould be able to patronize them more powerfully after his death, than ever he had been during the cour&s;e of his life. Lanfranc was born at Pavia; and,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. Pari$.</NOTE> after he had fini&s;hed his &s;tudies, made a monk in the abbey of Be$ in Nor|mandy, where he taught logic with great reputation: he treated his brother monks with &s;uch contempt for their ignorance, that they con&s;pired again&s;t him, and trumped up an accu&s;ation, which they pre&s;ented to William the Conqueror, before his expedition into England; he was therefore obliged to appear at court in his own ju&s;tification, and, upon that occa&s;ion, in&s;inuated him&s;elf &s;o far into the favour of his &s;overeign, that he made him abbot of St. Stephen's at Caen, from whence he was afterwards removed to the &s;ee of Canterbury. The credit which he maintained during the reign of the Con|queror, declined under William Rufus, whom he had actually rai&s;ed to the throne: he rebuilt the church of Canterbury, which had been burnt by the Danes, and limited the number of the monks of St. Augu&s;tine to one hundred and fifty; he likewi&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed a prior in that convent, whereas they were formerly governed by an abbot: he wrote a commentary on the epi&s;tles of St. Paul, and an eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, which is not extant; but the mo&s;t e&s;teemed of all his works, was a treati&s;e compo&s;ed again&s;t Berenger, in defence of the real pre&s;ence in the &s;acrament: notwith&s;tanding this proof of his orthodoxy, Gregory VII. &s;ummoned him to appear at Rome, and give an account of his faith, on pain of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion; but this order he never obeyed.</P>

<P>An&s;elm abbot of Bec, and afterwards archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, made more noi&s;e than all the prelates of the Engli&s;h church, by his quarrels with William Rufus and Henry I. Clement the antepope being &s;till alive,

w$en Urban II. was elected, England refu&s;ed to acknowledge either the one $word$ the other; till An&s;elm, embroiling him&s;elf with William Rufus, declared $word$ for Urban; in order to thwart the king, who &s;eemed to favour his com|p$t$tor. William, re&s;olving to humble him for his pre&s;umption, gave Urban to $nder&s;tand, that if he would &s;end to him the pall de&s;igned for An&s;elm, &s;o a$ that the bi&s;hop &s;hould receive it from his hands, he would reduce the c$urch of England to his obedience. The pope agreed to the propo&s;al, and &s;ent the bi&s;hop of Alba into England, to tran&s;act the affair: William executed h$s $ngagement by acknowledging Urban in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner; but, $word$ he demanded the pall, the nuncio told him, that no bi&s;hop could receive it from the hands of a layman; &s;o that he found him&s;elf outwitted by the craft of Rome. William never forgave the pope, nor the prelate, who was obliged to leave the kingdom, and continue abroad till the death of that mo|narch. During his re&s;idence at Rome, he a&s;&s;i&s;ted at a council, in which ex|communication was denounced again&s;t all eccle&s;ia&s;tics, who, for the future, &s;hould receive the inve&s;titure of their benefices from the hands of laymen; and it was in con&s;equence of this decree, that when he was recalled to England, by Henry I. he refu&s;ed to do homage to that prince, or con&s;ecrate the bi&s;hops who had been inve&s;ted by him. As this refu&s;al affected the king's preroga|tive, he re&s;ented it highly; but that he might not break with Rome, at a time when the papal power was very formidable, he &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to Pa&s;chal II. to complain of this encroachment, and de&s;ire he would order An&s;elm to con|form to the cu&s;toms of the kingdom. The pope refu&s;ed to grant a reque&s;t which was contrary to the decrees of &s;everal councils. Henry would not part with his rights; and commanded the archbi&s;hop to do him homage, and con&s;ecrate the prelates, who had received the inve&s;titure according to the u&s;ual form. An&s;elm &s;till held out, and the king ordered him to quit the realm. He rejected this command; and the king's council was of opinion, that Henry &s;hould bani&s;h the archbi&s;hop, and renounce all dependence upon the pope. It was re&s;olved, however, in a general a&s;&s;embly, that amba&s;&s;adors &s;hould be &s;ent to Rome, in order, if po&s;&s;ible, to prevail upon the pope to de&s;i&s;t from his preten&s;ions. The archbi&s;hop of York and two other prelates were charged with this commi&s;&s;ion; and An&s;elm &s;ent two agents at the &s;ame time to main|tain his cau&s;e before his holine&s;s. The amba&s;&s;adors told the pope, that he mu&s;t either relax in the article of inve&s;titure, or &s;ee An&s;elm bani&s;hed, and all England withdrawn from its obedience to the Roman &s;ee. Pa&s;chal replied, that he would rather forfeit his own dignity, than give up the lea&s;t tittle of his preten&s;ions. Negotiations were ineffectually &s;et on foot; and the di&s;pute was inflamed to &s;uch a degree of animo&s;ity, that Pa&s;chal threatened to excommu|nicate the king, and An&s;elm was obliged to retire to Lyons. The difference, however, was at length compromi&s;ed between Henry and the archbi&s;hop, by the mediation of Adela counte&s;s of Blois, the king's &s;i&s;ter, who procured an interview between them, at the ca&s;tle of L'Aigle in Normandy, where they di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the articles of agreement; and the pope confirmed the accommoda|tion. The king renounced the right of be&s;towing the inve&s;titure of benefices; and the pope permitted bi&s;hops and abbots to do homage to the &s;overeign, for the eccle&s;ia&s;tical fiefs in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. An&s;elm compo&s;ed &s;everal theological

<P>Gilbert bi&s;hop of London, in the reign of Henry I. was, on ac|count of his learning, int$tuled Univer&s;ali&s;t: he compo&s;ed a commentary on the P&s;alms of David, and an expo&s;ition of the Lamentations of Jeremiah. We have already mentioned O&s;mond bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury, who was earl of Dor&s;et and privy coun&s;ellor to William the Conqueror. The liturgy which he compo&s;ed, was adopted by all the dioce&s;es in England. Malachy archbi&s;hop of Armagh in Ireland was famous for his predictions about the popes that oc|cupied St. Peter's chair, after the time in which he lived. His prophecies are &s;till extant, and written in &s;uch an ambiguous manner, as to admit of any &s;ort of interpretation: his life was written by St. Bernard. Ingulph was known to William before his conque&s;t, when he vi&s;ited Edward the Confe&s;&s;or; he &s;erved that prince in the &s;tation of &s;ecretary, and afterwards went on a pil|grimage to Jeru&s;alem. At his return, he became a monk in the abbey of Fontevrand, from whence he was removed by William, who created him ab|bot of Croyland, where he died, after having writ the hi&s;tory of his convent, in&s;erted in the collection of old Engli&s;h hi&s;torians. Joffrid, his immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;or in that mona&s;tery, is &s;aid, by &s;ome authors, to have been the fir&s;t who opened &s;chools at Cambridge, where he &s;ettled four of his monks as profe&s;&s;ors. God|frid prior of the mona&s;tery of Winche&s;ter, was one of the be&s;t writers of the age. Among other works, he compo&s;ed a panegyric upon the primates of Eng|land: he reformed the &s;tile of the breviary, which abounded with barbari&s;ms; and is &s;aid by Alford, to have been the real corrector of the liturgy, which pa&s;&s;ed under the name of O&s;mund bi&s;hop of Sarum. John of Sali&s;bury was one of the ornaments of the Engli&s;h church, renowned for his knowledge, politene&s;s, and morality: he was the intimate friend of pope Adrian IV. who often complained to him of the cares and troubles that attended the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of St. Peter's chair; he attached him&s;elf to the fortune of Thomas Becket, whom he followed to France, and by who&s;e means he obtained the bi&s;hopric of Chartres: he wrote a book intituled Polycraticon, or de Nugis Curialium. As for Thomas Becket and Stephen Langton, we have el&s;ewhere de&s;cribed their characters at large. Baldwin archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who attended Richard to the Holy Land, pa&s;&s;ed for a good theologician; and &s;ome of his books &s;till extant ju&s;tify that encomium. Hugh bi&s;hop of Lincoln, a native of Grenoble, was one of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious prelates of the Anglicane church, under the reigns of Richard I. and John. His cen&s;ures were very much dreaded among his dioce&s;ans, becau&s;e they ob&s;erved that tho&s;e whom he excommuni|cated were generally overtaken, even in this life, by the judgment of heaven. He is &s;aid to have removed, by his &s;ole authority, the tomb of Ro&s;amond, mi&s;|tre&s;s of Henry II. from the church of God&s;tow in Oxford&s;hire, where it &s;tood in the middle of the choir, covered with black velvet, and &s;urrounded with wax tapers: though he was told that the tomb had been placed there by the king's order, he thought it was &s;candalous that the monument of a loo&s;e woman &s;hould maintain &s;uch a &s;acred place. He died in great reputation for &s;anctity, and was canonized by Honorius III. During the quarrel between king John and the pope, an eccle&s;ia&s;tic called Alexander Cementarius, who had been pro|fe&s;&s;or of theology in the univer&s;ity of Paris, publicly maintained in his &s;ermons,
<PB N="566" REF="5750">
that the pope had no power to deprive kings of their crowns; and by this $octri$e he brought upon him&s;elf the per&s;ecution of the &s;ee of Rome, which red$c$d him to the condition of a common beggar. Walter Gray archbi&s;hop of York, di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf as a mini&s;ter of &s;tate, enriched his dioce&s;e with the addition o$ the lands of Thorpe purcha&s;ed with his own money, and built a magni$$cent &s;tructure, which was at fir&s;t called York palace, but afterwards known by the name of Whitehall. Edmund, who from a canonicate of Sa|li&s;bury, was promoted to the archbi&s;hopric of Canterbury, after the pope had ann$l$ed three elections in his favour, was a prelate of great moderation and re|gular$ty of life. He would have oppo&s;ed the u&s;urpations of Rome, had not the pa$al power been then at its &s;ummit in England; but finding it irre&s;i&s;tible, he ret$red to the mona&s;tery of Pontigny in France, where he &s;hortened his days by his au&s;terities, and was canonized by pope Innocent IV. Richard P$or, at fir&s;t bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury, and from thence tran&s;lated to the &s;ee of Dur|h$m, per&s;$aded the inhabitants of Old Sarum to remove to the place which is now called Sali&s;bury, where he founded a noble church that remains to this day. He likewi&s;e compo&s;ed &s;ynodal con&s;titutions for the u&s;e of his church, in eighty-&s;even articles, by one of which it plainly appears that the laity at that time communicated in both &s;pecies. Alexander Hales, a native of Glouce&s;ter, &s;o deeply &s;ki$led in the canon law, that he acquired the title of the Irrefragable doctor, was profe&s;&s;or in the univer&s;ity of Paris; he compo&s;ed annotations on the bible and other works, that contain a great deal of logic and metaphy&s;ics. Siwald archbi&s;hop of York was an able theologician, of an irreproachable life$ he modelled his conduct on that of Edmund archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who had been his ma&s;ter; he was &s;o provoked at the extortion of Rome, that he wrote a letter to the pope complaining of his exactions; and among other things ob&s;erved, that when Je&s;us Chri&s;t gave charge of his &s;heep to St. Peter, he did not command him either to fleece or to flay his flock. In con&s;equence of this remon&s;trance, and his refu&s;ing to admit certain Italians who brought provi&s;ions from the court of Rome, he was &s;everely rebuked by his holine&s;s, and at length excommunicated. In his la&s;t moments he complained bitterly o$ the pope's inju&s;tice, from which he appealed to the judgment of God Almighty. Robert Kilwarby archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, was a prelate of ex|ten&s;ive learning for the age in which he lived; being rai&s;ed to the dignity of a cardinal he re&s;igned his archbi&s;hopric, and fixed his habitation in Rome. One of the mo&s;t famous eccle&s;ia&s;tics of this age, was Gro&s;ted bi&s;hop of Lincoln, a bold and re&s;olute prelate, whom the favours of the court could not allure, nor the menaces of the pope intimidate; &s;olely attached to the dictates of rea&s;on and equity, he had no re&s;pect of per&s;ons or circum&s;tances, and oppo&s;ed the king or the pope occa&s;ionally, according to the &s;ugge&s;tions of his own con|&s;cience: by this fortitude, h$ acquired great reputation among the people, ac|cu&s;tomed to &s;ee their bi&s;hops always &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to one or other of tho&s;e powers. Having one day excommunicated a &s;heriff, who refu&s;ed to impri&s;on a man who &s;coffed at the cen&s;ures of the church, Henry III. was incen&s;ed at his having neglected to addre&s;s him&s;elf on this occa&s;ion to the royal authority, and com|plained to the pope of his pre&s;umption. Gro&s;ted was obliged to make a jour|ney to Rome, in order to ju&s;tify his conduct, and there he was confirmed in his bad opinion of the papal power. He could not, without indignation, behold
<PB N="567" REF="5760">
the be&s;t benefices of the kingdom conferred upon Italians, who neither re&s;ided upon their livings, nor under&s;tood the language of the country; and becau&s;e he refu&s;ed to receive one of the&s;e foreigners into the riche&s;t living of his dioce&s;e, he was &s;u&s;pended by his holine&s;s. Neverthele&s;s he continued his functions at the de&s;ire of his flock, and &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing to admit the pope's provi|&s;ions in favour of other Italians, &s;aying, that to entru&s;t the care of &s;ouls with &s;uch mini&s;ters, would be to act in the name of the devil, rather than by the authority of God. The pope, rather than run the ri&s;k of a total revolt in the church of England, winked at the di&s;obedience of this prelate, who was ex|tremely beloved by the people. He endeavoured to win him over to his in|tere&s;t by gentlene&s;s and in&s;inuation; and as a mark of his e&s;teem, &s;ent him a commi&s;&s;ion to reform &s;ome abu&s;es which had crept into the mona&s;teries. Not|with&s;tanding this proof of his confidence and favour, Gro&s;ted afterwards in|flamed his re&s;entment, by making a calculation of the money drawn every year from England, by the Italian clergy who enjoyed livings in this king|dom: but as he would not venture to per&s;ecute the bi&s;hop upon this &s;ubject, which might have excited clamours dangerous to his intere&s;t, he &s;ent a threaten|ing brief to him, on account of his having refu&s;ed to receive the papal pro|vi&s;ions; and this the prelate tore and trampled under his feet, in &s;ight of all his clergy. Not contented with having expre&s;&s;ed his di&s;dain in this manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. Paris. Collier. John&s;on.</NOTE> he wrote a letter to the pope with &s;uch &s;pirit and freedom, as &s;eems almo&s;t in|credible, con&s;idering the &s;uper&s;tition of tho&s;e times, and the abject veneration with which the clergy in general obeyed the papal authority.</P>

<P>After this &s;hort &s;ketch of church-tran&s;actions, and the charac|ters of the prelates who di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves for their piety and learning, we &s;hall now take a tran&s;ient view of the hi&s;torians who flouri&s;hed in England, during this period of time. Florence monk of Worce&s;ter compo&s;ed a chroni|cle of the world, from the creation to the year of Chri&s;t 1118, &s;uppo&s;ed to be an epitome of a larger work of the &s;ame nature, compiled by Marinus. Alu|red or Alfred, trea&s;urer of the college of Beverley, began his hi&s;tory during the difference between Henry I. and An&s;elm archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. Eadmer was intimately connected with this prelate, and wrote the hi&s;tory of the two Williams and Henry I. In the &s;ame age lived William of Malmesbury, who&s;e chief work is intituled De Ge&s;tis Anglorum: he was patronized by Robert the renowned earl of Glouce&s;ter, of whom we have treated at large in the hi&s;tory of Stephen. Simeon of Durham was a monk of that place, of indefatigable in|du&s;try in collecting the principal monuments of learning, which had e&s;caped the Dani&s;h barbarity. He flouri&s;hed in the reigns of Henry I. and Stephen; and his hi&s;tory, which is chiefly taken from Florence of Worce&s;ter, reaches no farther than the year 1129. The chronicle of Melros was compo&s;ed by the abbot of Dundrainon, and contains many curious particulars relating to the kingdom of Northumberland. Henry archdeacon of Huntingdon lived in the reigns of Henry and king Stephen, to the end of who&s;e reign he has brought down his hi&s;tory, which is very defective in method, and interlarded with fabulous &s;tories tran&s;cribed from Geo&s;&s;iey of Monmouth. Ealred, Aethel|red, or Aldred, abbot of Rieve&s;bury in Lincoln&s;hire, was educated in Scot|land, with Henry &s;on to king David, and wrote the life of Edward the Con|$e&s;&s;or, the hi&s;tory of the battle of the Standard, and the genealogy of the kings

of England. $span$ G$$$$mus N$ubrigen&s;is, or William monk of $span$ brought down to the y$ar 1197. He was $word$ e$$g$nt $word$ and tr$ats the work or Geoffrey of Monmouth as a ro|mance. Jo$n $word$ o$ Hexham wrote a continuation of the hi&s;tory com|p$$ed by $word$ of Durham, to the year 1154: he lived in the reign of Richard I. and the &s;ame convent produced another hi&s;torian in the per&s;on of prior R$$hard, who compo&s;ed the hi&s;tory of king Stephen, and the war of the Standard. Ralph Diceto, dean of St. Paul's, lived in the reign of John, and wrote a chronicle of the Briti&s;h kings, from Brute to Cadwallader, and from Heng$$t to Harold: he was likewi&s;e author of Chronological Abbrevia|tions, chiefly relating to eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, and the Imagines Hi&s;toriarum, o$ a $$llection of hi&s;torical hints, containing a long digre&s;&s;ion concerning wars between parents and children, and the account of an interview between John of England and the king of France, in the year 1199. Roger Hoveden was chaplain to Henry II. and wrote annals, beginning at the year 732, and con|tinued down to the reign of king John: he borrowed largely from Simeon of Durham, and the writers that went before him; is confu&s;ed in his narration; but his $ule is intelli$ible, and his work contains very valuable materials. The chro$$cle of John Brompton, abbot of Scorewall in Richmond&s;hire, begi$s with the year 5$$, and ends with the death of Richard Coeur de Lion; though far from being a ma&s;terly performance, it contains the tran&s;actions of the Anglo-Saxon hi&s;tory, collected with great fidelity; and therefore it is con&s;idered as an authentic work: there is indeed a mixture of romance and improbability in his book, which was rather the fault of the age than of the writer; and he is ju&s;tly blamed for his negligence in chronology. John Wal|lingford, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been abbot of St. Alban's, wrote a &s;hort chronicle of the Saxon and Dani&s;h progre&s;s in England, which is in the Cottonian li|brary, though mi&s;erably m$tilated and defaced. Gerva&s;e, monk of Canter|bury, who lived in the reign of king John, is &s;aid to have been profoundly learned in the Briti&s;h and Saxon antiquities: he compiled a large hi&s;tory of the Brit$ns, Saxons, and Normans, from their origin to the reign of John, with an account of the divi$$$n of Old Britain, its epi&s;copal &s;eats and mona&s;|teries; the b$lk o$ this work is lo&s;t, though the remains, containing the reigns of Stephen, Henry, and Richard, are very valuable. Matthew Paris $$ved in the reign of Henry III. and was a monk of St. Alban's: his hi&s;tory b$g$ns with the Conqueror, and is carried on to the author's death, which happened in the year 1299; from thence it is continued to the end of Henry's reign, by William Ri&s;hanger, a monk of the &s;ame &s;ociety: his reputation for virtue was &s;o high, that pope Innocent employed him to reform the degene|rated monks of H$lme in Norway; at his return he became &s;o eminent for his parts and integrity, that he was honoured with the friend&s;hip of the greate&s;t $word$ in England, and received particular marks of favour and di&s;tinction from $word$ Henry, who retained him about his per&s;on, to record the tran&s;actions as they occurred; informed him of negotiations that were upon the carpet; $word$ him at his court; and, at his interce&s;&s;ion, pardoned the univer&s;ity $word$ Ox$ord, which had fallen under his di&s;plea&s;ure. He did not abu&s;e this $word$ by &s;ervile ad$$at$on; on the contrary, he never failed to take the $word$ freedom to &s;peak his &s;entiments, and find fault with what he found ami&s;s,

either on the admini&s;tration or the king's own private conduct. His work is the be&s;t account extant not only of Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, but al&s;o of Europe, during the period of which he wrote, and appealed to as &s;uch by all foreign writers. This performance in manu&s;cript is now in the king's library at St. James's, and the very &s;ame copy which he him&s;elf pre&s;ented to his abbey at St. Alban's. But be&s;ides this he wrote the lives of three and twenty abbots belonging to the &s;ame convent; though &s;ome authors make objections to the authenticity of that work. In the &s;ame reign lived Nicholas Trivet, prior of a mona&s;tery po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Dominicans at London, and &s;on of Sir Thomas Trivet, one of the itine|rant<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bale. Moreri. Leland. Gale. Nichol&s;on.</NOTE> ju&s;tices. He compo&s;ed a general hi&s;tory of Europe, from the acce&s;&s;ion of King Stephen to the year 1307. He was very accurate in his chronology; and though too conci&s;e, is a valuable hi&s;torian.</P>

<P>WE have already ob&s;erved that Edward I. embarked with his prince&s;s at Trapani, and arrived at Acon in Pale&s;tine, ju&s;t as the Saracens intended to be&s;iege that city. Though his troops did not exceed a thou&s;and men, his appearance not only animated the chri&s;tians, who had been greatly di&s;|pirited;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1271$</NOTE> but al&s;o di&s;concerted the infidels, who were alarmed at the arrival of a prince already renowned in arms, who&s;e veins were enriched with the &s;ame blood which warmed the heart of that Richard &s;o terrible to their fathers. They had already made a lodgment in the &s;uburbs of Acon, which they now abandoned; and Edward began to make preparations to attack them in his turn. He was immediately joined by &s;even thou&s;and chri&s;tians, ambitious of &s;erving under his banner; and his own troops being re&s;re&s;hed from the fatigue of the voyage, he marched to Nazareth, at the di&s;tance of twenty leagues from Acon, in order to be&s;iege that city. He &s;oon made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the place; and in his return fell into an ambu&s;cade of the Saracens, whom however he repul&s;ed. Then he directed his march towards a body of the infidels en|camped at Cakcow, whom he charged &s;o &s;uddenly that they were immediately routed, leaving a thou&s;and men dead upon the &s;pot, together with a very valu|able booty, with which Edward next day returned to Acon. He obtained ano|ther victory at St. George's; but as the&s;e were only advantages gained over incon&s;iderable detachments of the Saracens, and he found him&s;elf too weak to attempt any conque&s;t of importance, he &s;ollicited the government of Cyprus for a reinforcement; and they forthwith granted to the nephew of Richard their old ma&s;ter, what they had denied to the king of Jeru&s;alem. Edward's reputation was already &s;o di&s;&s;u&s;ed through the Ea&s;t, that Albaga king of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">H$n$ingford.</NOTE> Tartars, who had conquered great part of A&s;ia, and taken the la&s;t caliph in Baldac, wrote letters to the Engli&s;h prince, expre&s;&s;ing his e&s;teem and admira|$on of his character, and offering to &s;end an army to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>

<P>The Saracens being informed of the&s;e particulars, and dreading the consequences of Edward's commanding a numerous body of forces, had re|co$r&s;e to treachery, in order to deprive him of life, in the mo&s;t ba&s;e and cow|ardly manner. Though t$e Old Man of the mountain had been taken in his capital by the Tartars, and put to the &s;word, with all his followers that were found in the place, there &s;till remained an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in who had been educated un|der him, and undertook to murder the prince of England. This ruffian was furni&s;hed with letters from the governor of Joppa, propo&s;ing a negotiation; and by virtue of the&s;e obtained admittance to Edward, who conver&s;ed with him freely at different times in the French language, which the infidel under&s;tood. Having thus &s;ecured free egre&s;s and regre&s;s, he entered the prince's apartment on Fri$$y in Whit&s;$n-week; and the weather being extremely hot, found him &s;itting on his bed in a loo&s;e garment. There was no other per&s;on in the room but t$e a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, who thinking this a proper opportunity to perpetrate his de|&s;ign, &s;natched a dagger from his bo&s;om, and attempted to plunge it into the prince's belly. Edward endeavouring to parry the &s;troke, received a deep wound in his arm; and perceiving the infidel about to repeat his blow, &s;truck him with his foot on the brea&s;t &s;o forcibly that he fell upon the ground; then wre&s;ting the weapon from his hand, buried it in&s;tantly in his heart. The do|me&s;tics hearing a no$&s;e, broke into the room; and one of them, tran&s;ported with rage and apprehen&s;ion, &s;natched up a joint-&s;tool, with which he da&s;hed out the brains of the dead a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. The wound which Edward had received was the more dangerous as having been inflicted with a poi&s;oned dagger; and the fle&s;h beginning to exhibit &s;igns of a gangrene, he made his will and re&s;igned him&s;elf to his fate; but by the extraordinary &s;kill of an Engli&s;h &s;urgeon, the mortified parts were &s;carified, and the cure completed in little more than a<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. $$$2.</NOTE> &s;ortnight. The &s;oldan of Babylon &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to congratulate him upon his recovery, and in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner to di&s;claim any knowledge of the attempt. At the &s;ame time he propo&s;ed terms of accommodation &s;uch as Edward could not prudently reject, con&s;idering the &s;mall number of his fol|lowers, the va&s;t power of the enemy, and the letters of his father, pre&s;&s;ing his immediate return. He therefore received the &s;ultan's amba&s;&s;adors in an honou|rable manner, declared that he retained no &s;u&s;picion of their ma&s;ter touching the attempt which had been made upon his life, and concluded a truce with<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch. T. W$kes.</NOTE> him for ten years, ten weeks, and the like number of days, that the we&s;tern chri&s;tians might have lei&s;ure enough to return to their re&s;pective countries. This agreement being ratified, Edward &s;et &s;ail at Acra in Augu&s;t, and in Octo|ber arrived at Trappani in Sicily, where he had formerly embarked. While he &s;tayed at the court of his Sicilian maje&s;ty, he received the tidings of his father's decea&s;e, as well as of the death of his own &s;on John, in the &s;ixth year of his age. He bore the la&s;t with re&s;ignation, but appeared extremely af|flicted at his father's death; and when Charles of Anjou expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urprize that he &s;hould lament the lo&s;s of his father &s;o much more than he &s;eemed to mourn the decea&s;e of his own child, he replied, that the lo&s;s of a child might be made up, but that of a parent was irreparable.</P>

with his &s;on were now no more, Walter Giffard archbi&s;hop of York$ and the lords of the council$ managed affairs with &s;uch di&s;cretion that no bad con&s;equence en&s;ued. On the morning after the king's death, Edward was proclaimed at We&s;tmin&s;ter, and afterwards in Guild-hall; and all per&s;ons enjoined to keep the peace towards Jews as well as Chri&s;tians. Not|with&s;tanding the&s;e precautions, the city of London was filled with tumul$ and confu&s;ion, occa&s;ioned by a di&s;pute between the common-council and the populace, about the election of a mayor. The aldermen voted for Philip de Tailleur, and the common people declared they would obey no magi&s;trate but Walter Hervey, a turbulent man, who &s;et up for a demagogue or patron of the poorer citizens. This contention began during Henry's la&s;t illne&s;s; and both &s;ides repaired to We&s;tmin&s;ter, by way of appealing to his maje&s;ty, whom they di&s;turbed with their clamour in his la&s;t moments. The riot was repeated next day; and the common people had actually re&s;olved to plunder and de&s;troy the richer citizens, when, upon Henry's death, Walter de Merton and other members of the king's council went into the city, and compromi&s;ed the difference, by propo&s;ing a new election at St. Paul's Cro&s;s, where Hervey was cho&s;en mayor, after he had promi&s;ed upon oath that he would not oppre&s;$ or mole&s;t any per&s;on who had oppo&s;ed his elevation. This di&s;pute being accom|modated, the council gave directions touching Henry's funeral, and before his grave was filled up, ordered the great &s;eal to be broken, while another, purpo&s;ely made with an alteration in the name, was delivered to Walter de Merton as chancellor. All the noblemen pre&s;ent at the ob&s;equies took the oath of allegiance to Edward; the king's peace was republi&s;hed, and orders were &s;ent to proclaim them in their re&s;pective counties. In about a fortnight after the funeral, the great council of the kingdom was a&s;&s;embled in the new tem|ple, and the oath admini&s;tered to all the prelates, noblemen, and freeholders, in England. Tho&s;e of Ireland &s;wore fealty to Edward before Maurice Fitz-Maurice, the ju&s;ticiary of that kingdom; but Llewellyn ap Griffith, prince of North Wales, being &s;ummoned to appear and take the oath at the ford of Montgomery, declined meeting the commi&s;&s;ioners. The chief actor, in all<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer$</NOTE> the&s;e &s;teps that were taken to e&s;tabli&s;h the tranquillity of the kingdom, was Walter Merton the chancellor, who though an eccle&s;ia&s;tic never &s;crupled to oppo&s;e the encroachments of the clergy, when they interfered with the king's prerogative: he had been very active in preventing the mi&s;chievous con&s;e|quences of the di&s;turbance in the city of London, and exerted him&s;elf again&s;t the provi&s;ion of the late pope, who had nominated Robert de Kildwarby to the archbi&s;hopric of Canterbury, without a canonical election or the con&s;ent of the crown; nor would he &s;uffer the bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter to enter the king|dom, after having been ab&s;olved by his holine&s;s, becau&s;e he was accompanied by Amaury de Montfort. He likewife employed his vigilance and conduct in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing robbers who infe&s;ted the country, and in repleni&s;hing the king's exchequer by laying a talliage on the cities, boroughs, and towns of the crown deme&s;nes. <NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>Mean while Edward vi&s;ited Rome, in con&s;equence of an invitation from Gregory X. who attended him to Pale&s;tine, from whence he had been recalled to fill St. Peter's chair; and this pontiff now indulged him with the grant of two or three tenths of all eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues throughout England, to reimbur&s;e him for the expences of his expedition. In pa&s;&s;ing through Italy,
<PB N="574" REF="5830">
he was every where received with honours and acclamation. On the frontiers of Savoy he was met by &s;everal Engli&s;h prelates and noblemen; and his queen parting from him at Lyon, repaired directly to Ga&s;cony, where &s;he was in a little time delivered of a &s;on named Alphon&s;o. His renown excited the envy and emulation of the count de Chalons, who, when he arrived at that city, propo&s;ed a tournament, and even defied Edward to a trial of chivalry. The Engli&s;h monarch accepted the challenge, and with his knights, holding the field again&s;t all that would enter the li&s;ts, obtained the honour of the day; when the count, enraged at his &s;ucce&s;s, converted tho&s;e feats of dexterity into a real engagement. Some blood was &s;pilt; but the Engli&s;h &s;till maintained their &s;upenority. From Chalons Edward proceeded to Paris, where he was magnificently entertained by Philip king of France, to whom he did homage for Guienne and the other territories which he ought to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in that<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. We$$non. A$n. T$ve$.</NOTE> kingdom. Edward, after a &s;hort &s;tay at the French court, &s;et out for Ga&s;|cony; and Ga&s;ton vi&s;count de Bearne, who had rebelled in his ab&s;ence, fled at his approach to the mountains, to which he was pur&s;ued and taken in one of his fortre&s;&s;es. As Edward treated him with great lenity, and allowed him to ride about on his word and honour, Ga&s;ton took the fir&s;t opportunity to make his e&s;cape; and being &s;ummoned to appear at the court of Ga&s;cony held at St. Sever, without obeying the citation, he was condemned in the forfeiture of his towns, ca&s;tles, and effects, for the u&s;e of his maje&s;ty. The king en|tered his country with a body of forces to execute this &s;entence; and Ga&s;ton &s;eeing him&s;elf on the brink of de&s;truction, appealed to Philip as lord para|mount of the province. Edward immediately retired, and by a proclamation forbade any per&s;on to injure the vi&s;count or his va&s;&s;als, until the cau&s;e &s;hould be determined. The appeal was accordingly heard in the court of France, which decreed, that Ga&s;ton &s;hould repair to England, and throwing him&s;elf at Edward's feet, &s;ubmit to his maje&s;ty's mercy. The king would not act as judge in his own cau&s;e, which he referred to the king of France: but Ga&s;ton, di&s;&s;atisfied with the &s;entence, demanded of the court, that he might be allowed to decide the di&s;pute in &s;ingle combat with Edward. His in&s;olent demand was rejected; and he continued in a &s;tate of outlawry for &s;ix years, at the expira|tion of which he obtained his pardon, and was re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymes</NOTE> of his territories.</P>

<P>During Edward's re&s;idence in Ga&s;cony, he engaged in two alliances; one with Peter the elde&s;t infant of Arragon, and the other with Henry I. king of Navarre: they were cemented by contracts of marriage between the chil|dren of tho&s;e princes and the king of England, which however did not take effect. Peter's elde&s;t &s;on, contracted to Eleanor daughter of Edward, did not live to the age of puberty: and the king of Navarre dying in the cour&s;e of the &s;ucceeding year, the mother of the young prince&s;s de&s;tined for the prince of England, carried her to Paris, where &s;he was afterwards married to Philip<NOTE PLACE="marg">$n.

At Montre$$l he was vi&s;ited by Guy de Dam|pierre count of Flanders, who went thither to meet him, that they might ac|commodate a difference which, for &s;ome years, had interrupted the commerce between the Engli&s;h and Flemings. It had been cu&s;tomary for the kings of

England to grant pen&s;ions to the counts of Flanders, for certain &s;ervices which tho&s;e counts undertook to perform: and Margaret the pre&s;ent counte&s;s laid claim to the like annuity. Her demand being rejected at the court of Eng|land, &s;he &s;eized the effects of the merchants belonging to England and Ga&s;cony, which happened to be in her dominions; and reprifals were made upon her &s;ub|jects in England. Severe penalties were enacted again&s;t the exportation of wool to Flanders; &s;o that Margaret, finding her&s;elf di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by this prohibition, was fain to &s;ue for an accommodation, and ordered her &s;on to meet Edward at Montreuil for that purpo&s;e. The king &s;ent for &s;ome of the principal citizens of London to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the conferences; and a treaty of peace was concluded on condition that Margaret &s;hould relinqui&s;h all claim to the annuity, make good the damage &s;u&s;tained by the &s;eizure of the effects belonging to the Eng|li&s;h merchants; and that &s;ome of her chief nobility &s;hould be bound for the performance of this engagement.</P>

<P>This affair being &s;ettled, and a free trade opened with Flanders, Ed|ward took &s;hipping for England, and arrived at Dover in the beginning of Augu&s;t. On the nineteenth day of the &s;ame month he was crowned at We&s;t|min&s;ter, by Robert de Kilwarby archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, in the mid&s;t of a va&s;t concour&s;e of prelates, nobility, and people, which la&s;t were fea&s;ted a whole fortnight at the king's expence. Edmund earl of Lanca&s;ter, the bro|ther of Edward, officiated as high &s;teward of England on this occa&s;ion, and next day renounced all hereditary title to that office. Alexander III. king of Scotland was pre&s;ent at this &s;olemnity, and did homage for the lands he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed as depending on the crown of England. His queen Margaret likewi&s;e graced her brother's inauguration, as well as his other &s;i&s;ter Beatrix, married to John duke of Brittany: but both the&s;e ladies died in a few months after this ceremony; and he &s;u&s;tained the additional affliction of lo&s;ing his own &s;on Henry. At the coronation, which was extremely magnificent, five hundred hor&s;e were turned loo&s;e, as the property of tho&s;e who &s;hould catch them. The king was enabled to defray &s;uch extraordinary expence, by the tax upon eccle|&s;ia&s;tical revenues granted to him by pope Gregory; but as his exchequer was almo&s;t exhau&s;ted, his fir&s;t care, after he had received the crown, was to exa|mine the &s;tate of his own revenues. For this purpo&s;e, he appointed com|mi&s;&s;ioners of inque&s;t, to make a progre&s;s through all the counties of the king|dom, and not only take an exact information of every circum&s;tance relating to the crown fiefs, but al&s;o examine and puni&s;h the malver&s;ation of magi&s;trates and &s;heriffs, who had lately abu&s;ed their authority and oppre&s;&s;ed their fellow|&s;ubjects.</P>

<P>That he might take more effectual &s;teps for protecting his people<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 127$.</NOTE> from &s;uch extortion, he &s;ummoned a general parliament, in which &s;everal excellent laws were enacted for the ea&s;e and advantage of the &s;ubjects, who were &s;o well plea&s;ed with tho&s;e regulations, that they granted a fifteenth of all their moveables, to pay the debts which the king had contracted in his expe|dition to the Holy Land. The merchants, out of gratitude for the great care he had taken of their intere&s;t in the treaty with Flanders, as well as in freeing them from divers heavy duties and tolls, de&s;ired that a tax of half a mark &s;hould be laid on every &s;ack of wool, and twice as much upon three hundred &s;kins, and on a la&s;t of leather, to be levied for the benefit of the king and his heirs for ever. It was known by the name of the New Cu&s;tom,
<PB N="576" REF="5850">
in contradi&s;tinction to that which had been formerly paid, and is &s;aid to have been granted by the prelates and nobility, as well as by the merchants of the king|dom. Towards the latter end of the late reign, the Jews had, by bribing the king's council, been admitted to all the privileges of chri&s;tian natives: they purcha&s;ed hou&s;es, lands, and manors; &s;at on juries; enjoyed &s;ei&s;in and ward|&s;hips of chri&s;tian heirs, together with the right of pre&s;entation to livings. This indulgence rai&s;ed a clamour among the clergy, and gave great of|fence to all &s;orts of people. The king him&s;elf was &s;hocked at the &s;candalous connivance of his father in this particular; and at his de&s;ire a law was made in this parliament, rendering Jews incapable of holding fee or freehold; obli$ing them to wear a mark on their outward garments, to di&s;tingui&s;h them from Chri&s;tians; and prohibiting them, on &s;evere penalties, from lending money<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chro$. D$$&s;t.</NOTE> at u&s;ury. As di&s;content &s;till prevailed among the nobility and freeholders who had been concerned in the late troubles, and &s;ubjected to the &s;tatute<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1276.</NOTE> called the Dictum de Kenilworth, Edward enquired into the nature of their complaints; and finding that a great number of di&s;putes had ari&s;en from the uncertainty of the time within which they could claim the benefit of that law, he exempted all per&s;ons from the imputation of rebellion who had not ap|peared in arms from the month of April, when his father marched towards Northampton, till the &s;ixteenth day of September in the following year, when the peace was proclaimed in the parliament of Winche&s;ter.</P>

<P>While Edward was employed in making the&s;e laudable regulations for the good of his &s;ubjects, including the clergy as well as the laity; he was &s;ummoned, as a peer of France, to the trial of a great cau&s;e depending between Robert duke of Burgundy and the count of Nevers, concerning the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to that dutchy; but he &s;ent agents to excu&s;e his non-attendance, on account of the &s;ituation of his own affairs in England; and Philip admitted his apology. The pope likewi&s;e demanded eight thou&s;and marks, as the arrears of the annual tribute; which were paid accordingly, though Edward was a&s;hamed of this vile acknowlegement, and afterwards propo&s;ed to pope Nicho|las III. that in&s;tead of being i&s;&s;ued from the exchequer, it might be charged upon &s;ome abbeys and priories, which he would endow for that purpo&s;e: but the pope perceiving his drift, would not hearken to the propo&s;al, by which he might invalidate a claim to more important demands, when a proper opportu|tunity<NOTE PLACE="marg">$ymer.</NOTE> &s;hould occur.</P>

<P>When the parliament broke up, Edward re&s;olved to march again&s;t Llewellyn, prince of North Wales, who had refu&s;ed to do homage for his dominions, and &s;eemed bent upon renouncing his dependence upon the crown of England. At the death of Henry, he had been &s;ummoned to come and take the oath to the ab&s;ent king; but he paid no manner of regard to this in|timation. When Edward arrived, he was again required to do homage and a&s;&s;i&s;t at the coronation; but, in&s;tead of obeying the order, he demanded &s;atisfaction for &s;ome outrages which he &s;aid the Engli&s;h had committed upon the frontiers, contrary to the articles of the la&s;t treaty. That he might have no pretext for delaying his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, the king appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to examine and ad|ju&s;t all matters in di&s;pute, and &s;ummoned him again to appear and do homage. He &s;till refu&s;ed to comply; and, under&s;tanding that the archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury intended to excommunicate his per&s;on, and lay his dominions under an
<PB N="577" REF="5860">
interdict, he had recour&s;e to the protection of the pope, who forbade the metro|politan to pronounce tho&s;e cen&s;ures again&s;t him, as he offered to do homage in his own country; for he pretended that he was not obliged to perform that act of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, except to the king in per&s;on on the frontiers of his dominions. Edward was willing to receive it even on the&s;e terms, and actually &s;et out for Shrew&s;bury to meet Llewellyn upon the border, but he being taken ill on the road, the meeting was deferred till another opportunity. That prince was afterwards &s;ummoned to appear before the parliament, but he again refu&s;ed to come, alledging that as the king had always acted as his &s;worn enemy, he could not tru&s;t him&s;elf at the Engli&s;h court, but would do homage to the crown in his own dominions, if the king would &s;end thither commi&s;&s;ioners to receive it, or in any other neutral country: he even offered to appear at We&s;t|min&s;ter, if Edward would &s;end his elde&s;t &s;on, together with the earl of Glou|ce&s;ter and the chancellor into Wales, as ho&s;tages for the &s;ecurity of his per&s;on. The king, incen&s;ed at this in&s;olent me&s;&s;age, re&s;olved to reduce him to obedience by more effectual mea&s;ures; and in the mean time, proceeded with the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the nation: but that was no &s;ooner fini&s;hed, than he began to prepare for an expedition into Wales. In this interval, Eleanor de Mont$ort, daugh|ter<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. Pub.</NOTE> of the late earl of Leice&s;ter, being betrothed to Llewellyn, was, in her pa&s;&s;age from the continent to Wales, under the conduct of her brother Amaury, taken near the Scilly i&s;les by a cor&s;air of Bri&s;tol, and delivered to the king's officers. This young lady was detained in the queen's court; and her brother was confined in the ca&s;tle of Sherburn, until he was claimed as the pope's chaplain, and removed to an eccle&s;ia&s;tical pri&s;on. Llewellyn &s;ent letters to Edward, demanding his bride, and &s;ignifying that he would do homage at Montgomery, provided he might have a &s;afe-conduct &s;ub&s;cribed by the fir&s;t noblemen of the kingdom, and an a&s;&s;urance that the king would confirm the articles of the la&s;t peace, and amend tho&s;e that were defective. His in&s;olence excited the indignation of the parliament, which granted a &s;ub&s;idy for enabling the king to reduce him by force of arms. He was, by a &s;entence of the king's court, convicted of contumacy and rebellion. The military tenants of the crown were &s;ummoned to meet the king at Worce&s;ter, by Mid&s;ummer of the en&s;uing year; the Marches were guarded, the forts &s;upplied with &s;trong gar|ri&s;ons and &s;tore of ammunition; and all the &s;ubjects of Edward prohibited from holding any corre&s;pondence with Llewellyn or his adherents. The arch|bi&s;hop<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann. Waverl.</NOTE> of Canterbury and his &s;uffragans renewed their threats of excommu|nication and interdict, which were actually publi&s;hed again&s;t him in the begin|ning of next year. Roger de Mortimer was appointed commander of all the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. $277.</NOTE> forces in Hereford&s;hire, Salop, and the adjacent Marches; while William de Beauchamp earl of Warwick, and Pagen de Chaworth, who commanded in Che&s;hire, were empowered to pardon &s;uch of Llewellyn's adherents as &s;hould be willing to &s;ubmit and do homage to the king of England. This was the c$&s;e with Re&s;e ap Meredith, lord of Dynevour, who did homage on condition of holding his lands immediately of the crown: his example was followed by all the noblemen of South Wales; and the ca&s;tle of Stratywy was delivered to Chaworth, who erected another at Abery&s;twyth for the defence of the country. The king re&s;olved to make an entire conque&s;t of Wales; and that the admini|&s;tration of ju&s;tice might not &s;uffer while he &s;hould be engaged in this expedi|tion,
<PB N="578" REF="5870">
he removed the court of exchequer and the ju&s;tices of the bench to Shrew&s;bury. About Mid&s;ummer he invaded Wales, on the &s;ide of Che&s;hire, with a numerous army; and as Llewellyn chiefly depended upon his inacce&s;&s;ible woods and fa&s;tne&s;&s;es, the king ordered a large road to be opened through a long tract of woods, from the Marches as far as Caernarvon&s;hire, that his troops might penetrate with ea&s;e into the heart of the country. While the bulk of his army was employed in this work, he erected the ca&s;tles of Flint and R$thland as he advanced; and then marched forwards to the mountains of Snow|dun, to which the enemy had retired. Perhaps in that retreat the Wel&s;h prince might have &s;till &s;et him at defiance, could he have &s;creened him&s;elf from the attacks of famine; but Edward had not only cut off the communica|tion by land, between him and any country that could furni&s;h him with provi|&s;ions, but he was likewi&s;e attended by a fleet of the Cinque-Ports, which &s;coured the &s;ea and reduced the i&s;land of Angle&s;ey, from whence Llewellyn had been hitherto &s;upplied. Finding him&s;elf thus reduced to the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, he was obliged to &s;ue for peace, and even to comply with &s;uch terms as Edward thought proper to impo&s;e. The treaty was concluded at Aberconway, on con|dition that Llewellyn &s;hould pay fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, by way of &s;atis+faction for damages; that he &s;hould relinqui&s;h for ever all the country from Chefhire to the river Conway, and retain the i&s;le of Angle&s;ey as a grant from Edward, for which he &s;hould pay a thou&s;and marks annually; that all the Wel&s;h nob$$ity &s;hould &s;wear allegiance to the king of England, except four barons of Snowdun, who continued to hold of Llewellyn; that he &s;hould re|lea&s;e all the barons he had impri&s;oned, and do ju&s;tice to his own brothers, who had fled from his oppre&s;&s;ion to the Engli&s;h court; that Llewellyn, with his council, and twenty men out of every cant$ed in his dominions, &s;hould an|nually &s;wear to the performance of the&s;e articles; that ten of the principal no|bility &s;hould be delivered as ho&s;tages; and Llewellyn in per&s;on do homage to Edward, fir$t at Ruthland and afterwards at London. This pacification being ratified$ the king remitted the payment of the fifty thou&s;and pounds, and Llewellyn accompanied him to We&s;tmin&s;ter$ where he took the oath on Chri&s;t|mas<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch. 12$$.</NOTE> day, in pre&s;ence of the prelates and nobility of England. He failed, however, in coming to the next parliament which was held at Gla&s;tenbury, where the king ordered Arthur's tomb to be opened, in order to view the &s;kele|ton of that renowned monarch; and his ab&s;ence giving ri&s;e to &s;ome doubts of his intention, Edward advanced with a body of forces into the Marches. He &s;ummoned Llewellyn to Worce&s;ter, where he was vi&s;ited by that prince, who vindicated him&s;elf &s;o much to the king's &s;atisfaction, that he re&s;tored the ho&s;|tages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">C$.

<P>Immediately after this expedition, Edward &s;ettled the articles of a con|tract of marriage between his daughter Joan of Acra and Hartman, elde&s;t &s;on of Rodolphus of Hap&s;burg king of the Romans: but that young prince died before he was of age to con&s;ummate the nuptials. He likewi&s;e concluded a treaty of the &s;ame kind, between his third daughter Margaret, and John elde&s;t &s;on of the duke of Lorrain and Brabant; a match which was afterwards com|pleted when the prince&s;s attained the age of fifteen. About this period too, Alexander III. of Scotland, renewed his homage to Edward, before the parlia|ment
<PB N="579" REF="5880">
at We&s;tmin&s;ter, when the Scot profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf the king's liege va&s;&s;al, and Robert de Brus earl of Carrick took the oath of fealty in his name. In this a&s;&s;embly the &s;tatute of Glouce&s;ter, enacted during the Wel&s;h expedition, was confirmed: it was a compendium of &s;ome excellent laws, &s;ecuring the rights and liberties of the &s;ubjects, and providing for the better admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. His finances being exhau&s;ted, he i&s;&s;ued orders to the &s;heriffs for &s;ummoning all per&s;ons that held of him by knights &s;ervice in capite, and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed a fee of twenty pounds a year, to come and receive the honour of knight|hood. As the coin of the kingdom was almo&s;t ruined by the practice of clip|ping, a great number of the Jews, &s;u&s;pected of this crime, was apprehended in different parts of England; and being convicted upon trial, condemned to death. Two hundred and eighty were executed in London, be&s;ides tho&s;e that &s;uffered in other towns of England: their hou&s;es and effects were forfeited for the u&s;e of the king, who a&s;&s;igned one half of the produce for the mainte|nance of &s;uch as &s;hould be converted to chri&s;tianity.

<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e tran&s;actions, the county of Ponthieu devolved<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Edward &s;ub&s;cribed to the &s;ame renunciation; and, upon giving &s;ecurity for the payment of &s;ix thou&s;and livres to the French king, was put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Ponthieu, together with the Age|nois, and &s;ome lands in the Limo&s;in, Perigort, and Quercy, to which he ought to have &s;ucceeded at the death of Alphon&s;o count of Poitiers. Having &s;ettled the terms of this agreement, and received the homage of his new va&s;&s;als, he returned to England, to fini&s;h his plan of reformation. Great complaints had been made of the exce&s;&s;ive wealth of the clergy and convents, which daily increa&s;ed, to the prejudice of the laity, and indeed of the nation in general. Though care had been taken to in&s;ert, in the famous charter of king John, a clau&s;e, expre&s;ly forbidding the &s;ubjects to alienate their lands in favour of the church, this article had been entirely neglected; and now the abu&s;e was become &s;o dangerous, that the king plainly &s;aw the church mu&s;t in time engro&s;s all the lands of the kingdom, unle&s;s &s;ome remedy could be found for this growing evil. Edward a&s;&s;embled a parliament, to whom he explained his &s;entiments on this &s;ubject, ob&s;erving, that as the church neither died nor alienated, all their lands would be &s;wallowed up in that gulph, from which they could never emerge: he therefore de&s;ired they would deliberate maturely, and find out &s;ome remedy for a grievance of &s;uch importance. His propo&s;al was joy|fully received by the a&s;&s;embly; and the famous &s;tatute of Mortmain enacted, forbidding all per&s;ons whatever to di&s;po&s;e of their effects, in favour of religious &s;ocieties, without the expre&s;s permi&s;&s;ion of the king or lord of the fief. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ryley.</NOTE></P>

<P>Be&s;ides this con&s;titution, it was decreed that no per&s;on &s;hould come to parliament in armour: and John Peckham, nominated by the pope to the &s;ee of Canterbury on the promotion of Robert de Kilwarby lately created a cardinal, was called to account for &s;ome canons he had in&s;tituted at a &s;ynod
<PB N="580" REF="5890">
in Reading, encroaching upon the king's prerogative. He was &s;ummoned before the king's council, and obliged not only to revoke the particular arti|cles lard to his charge, but al&s;o to renounce all other canons that might be prejudicial to the royal prerogative, or interfere with the rights and privileges of the kingdom. This humiliation of the prelate was extremely agreeable to the archbi&s;hop of York, who had been long at variance with him, about the ceremony of carrying the cro&s;s erect in one another's province; and Henry converted their animo&s;ity to his own advantage. He now propo&s;ed that they &s;hould procure in his favour a fifteenth, for three years, of the revenues of their clergy. York was &s;o well plea&s;ed with the mortification to which Ed|ward had &s;ubjected his rival, that he agreed to the propo&s;al immediately; and the other was obliged to comply, le&s;t York &s;hould intirely &s;upplant him of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spelman.</NOTE> king's favour. The peace of the kingdom being now perfectly re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, Edward employed his good offices in compromi&s;ing the differences that di&s;|turbed the tranquillity of his neighbours. He mediated an accommodation between the kings of France and Ca&s;tile: Rodolph king of the Romans, and Philip count of Savoy compromi&s;ed their quarrel in con&s;equence of his inter|po&s;ition; and he appea&s;ed a di&s;pute which his aunt Margaret, queen-mother of France, had with her own &s;on Charles, king of Sicily, concerning her rights<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$.

<P>At home he made a progre&s;s through the different countries, to hear the complaints, and redre&s;s the grievances of his &s;ubjects; but, in the cour&s;e of the&s;e regulations, he took one &s;tep which might have produced in|finite mi&s;chief to the kingdom. During the late troubles, &s;everal people had u&s;urped lands, to which they had no lawful title, and the crown had &s;uffered by the&s;e appropriations: in order to reform this abu&s;e, the parliament a&s;&s;em|bled in the cour&s;e of this year, enacted a &s;tatute, called Quo Warranto, obliging all landholders to produce their charters and titles before &s;uch judges as &s;hould be appointed to examine their validity. This was a very ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary regulation, which, however, the king abu&s;ed for the gratification of his avarice. He knew that among the tenants of the crown, there was a good number of landholders who had lo&s;t their titles, and he re&s;olved to take advantage of their misfortune, on pretence of executing this &s;tatute Quo War|ranto. He publi&s;hed a proclamation, commanding all tho&s;e who held lands of the crown, to produce their titles before the judges of the kingdom; an order which was looked upon as the &s;ource of infinite mi&s;chief and oppre&s;&s;ion. Accordingly tho&s;e who were fir&s;t que&s;tioned, and could not produce original titles, although they pleaded long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, $ound them&s;elves obliged to pay large &s;ums to the king for the pre&s;ervation of their e&s;tates. But the progre&s;s of this evil was &s;topped by the re&s;olution of the earl of Warenne, who being required by the judges to produce his charter, un&s;heathed an old ru&s;ty &s;word, as the in&s;trument by which his ance&s;tors had acquired their lands, and with which he re&s;olved to pre&s;erve them to the la&s;t drop of his blood. This bold an&s;wer gave Edward to under&s;tand, that his inqui&s;ition would be attended with very dangerous con&s;equences; and, that the &s;pirit of independency which breathed defiance to his father, was not yet extingui&s;hed in the nation. Moved by the&s;e con&s;iderations, he revoked his proclamation; and the joy manife&s;ted

<P>Mean while prince Llewellyn, impatient of the Engli&s;h yoke, which his people began to find very &s;evere, re&s;olved to withdraw him&s;elf from the dominion of Edward, after he had in vain complained of oppre&s;&s;ion: his &s;ub|jects were &s;till more eager to renounce their dependence upon a nation they dete&s;ted; but, thinking it nece&s;&s;ary to effect a reconciliation between their prince and his brother David, whom Edward had created earl of Derby, before they would commence ho&s;tilities, the Wel&s;h noblemen interpo&s;ed their good offices. As David had rea&s;ons of complaint again&s;t the king of Eng|land, he readily a&s;&s;ented to their propo&s;al, and Llewellyn exacted no other condition of him, than an oath that he would never again enter into the &s;ervice of Edward, but always act again&s;t him as the inveterate enemy of his country. This agreement being ratified, David took the field with a body of forces;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1$8$.</NOTE> reduced the ca&s;tle of Harwarden, in which Sir Roger Clifford, ju&s;tice of the Marches, was found dangerou&s;ly wounded: then he ravaged the country, and laid &s;iege to the ca&s;tle of Ruthland. The king, being informed of the&s;e ho&s;|tilities, &s;ummoned his nobility and military tenants to meet him at Mid|&s;ummer, in Worce&s;ter; he removed his courts of ju&s;tice from We&s;tmin&s;ter to Shrew&s;bury; and, having a&s;&s;embled a numerous army, marched again&s;t Llewellyn and his brother, with full re&s;olution to exterminate the whole fa|mily, and reduce that people to &s;uch an abject &s;tate of &s;ubjection, that they &s;hould never be able in the &s;equel to excite a rebellion of any con&s;equence: what augmented his indignation, was the progre&s;s of Re&s;e Maelyon and Grif|fyth ap Owen, who, with other noblemen of South Wales, had taken &s;everal ca&s;tles, and wa&s;ted the lands of the Engli&s;h. At Edward's approach, Llew|ellyn and his brother abandoned the &s;iege of Ruthland, and retired to the mountains, which were found &s;o difficult of acce&s;s, that Edward's fury abated; and he allowed the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury to treat with the revolters con|cerning a peace.</P>

<P>That prelate expo&s;tulated with Llewellyn upon his having infringed the late treaty; and Llewellyn an&s;wered him in writing to this effect: That he was compelled to take arms in behalf of his people, who were oppre&s;&s;ed; and that if Edward would now grant him redre&s;s of grievances, he would im|mediately &s;ubmit, and live in perpetual amity with England. He ob&s;erved that the king had detained divers lands betwixt the rivers of Dyur and Dulus, and refu&s;ed to do him ju&s;tice, unle&s;s he would be judged according to the Engli&s;h law, contrary to the &s;tipulations of the la&s;t treaty: that the lord Re|ginald Gray, when appointed ju&s;tice, had pro&s;ecuted the Wel&s;h for tre&s;pa&s;&s;es committed in the late reign, notwith&s;tanding the general indemnity to which they were intitled at the la&s;t pacification; that Re&s;e ap Maelyon had been un|ju&s;tly deprived of his lands and cattle; that the ju&s;tice had introduced many new cu&s;toms into the four cantreds held by the king, though his maje&s;ty had expre&s;sly agreed that there &s;hould be no innovation of that nature; that the inhabitants of Angle&s;ey were tried by the Engli&s;h laws, condemned, fined, and impri&s;oned, contrary to the articles of the peace; that prince Llewellyn was compelled to pay &s;ums to the queen and queen-mother, under the name of Aurum Reginae, which was a grievous impo&s;ition; and that when his
<PB N="582" REF="5910">
nuptials were &s;olemnized at Worce&s;ter, the king obliged him to &s;ign and con|firm a writing, in which he promi&s;ed that he would never harbour or main|tain any per&s;on again&s;t the incl$nation of Edward; an article by which he might be deprived of his mo&s;t faithful friends and &s;ervants: that the ju&s;tice of Che&s;ter had levied a di&s;tre&s;s upon his goods, in lieu of a certain &s;hipwreck which he had &s;eized during the late war: that the king's officers, in&s;tead of doing ju&s;tice to the natives of Wales, oppre&s;&s;ed and impri&s;oned them, even out of wantonne&s;s of de&s;poti&s;m and partiality; and that the articles of the treaty, in favour of him&s;elf and his &s;objects, were never ob&s;erved, but in every in&s;tance infringed by tho&s;e who were intru&s;ted with the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. At the &s;ame time David, after having enumerated his important and faithful &s;ervices to Edward, complained that the king had deprived him of certain towns belonging to the cantreds, which had been be&s;towed upon him as the reward of his fidelity; that he was obliged to an&s;wer &s;uits, relating to Wales, in the king's court at Che&s;ter, contrary to the laws of the country; that the ju&s;tice of Che&s;ter had cut down his woods, oppre&s;&s;ed his tenants, ex|erci&s;ed an Engli&s;h juri&s;diction over the natives of Wales, and neglected his remon&s;trance, when he demanded &s;atisfaction in behalf of his own people: that he was threatened in the king's court with the lo&s;s of his woods, ca&s;tles, and children; and that in terror of &s;eeing his infants taken away as ho&s;tages, and him&s;elf condemned to death or perpetual impri&s;onment, he was fain to have recour&s;e to arms for his own &s;afety. The inhabitants of Ro&s;s and Pen|lyn at the &s;ame time pre&s;ented a li&s;t of grievances, including murthers, tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es, and extortion, to which they had been expo&s;ed; and Re&s;e ap Vauchan of Stratywy, with &s;everal other Wel&s;h noblemen, remon&s;trated again&s;t divers u&s;urpations upon their lands, privileges, and franchi&s;es, which the ju&s;tices had committed under the king's countenance, contrary to the dictates of equity, and the expre&s;s laws of Wales, which, by the late peace, they were left at li|berty<NOTE PLACE="marg">P$wel$$ Hi$t. o$ Wales.</NOTE> to enjoy.</P>

<P>The archbi&s;hop being convinced of the truth of the&s;e articles, in|terceded with the king in behalf of the Wel&s;h, and begged they might have free acce&s;s to his maje&s;ty, and liberty to depart without mole&s;tation. Edward told him, he was very well di&s;po&s;ed to do ju&s;tice unto all his &s;ubjects; that they &s;hould be freely admitted to his pre&s;ence with their complaints, and al|lowed to depart, &s;hould they appear worthy of that favour. He in&s;i&s;ted upon Llewellyn's ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and propo&s;ed the following terms, which the archbi&s;hop communicated to the Wel&s;h prince by the hands of Joannes Wal|len&s;is: The king will admit of no treaty concerning the four cantreds and the i&s;le of Angle&s;ey: Llewellyn &s;hall &s;ubmit at di&s;cretion; in which ca&s;e the king will be&s;tow upon him a pen&s;ion of one thou&s;and pounds, with &s;ome county or earldom in England, and make an honourable provi&s;ion for his daughter: The &s;ubjects of Llewellyn &s;hall be treated according to their condition, as the king &s;hall think proper to ordain: If David, brother to Llewellyn, will go to the Holy Land, he &s;hall be maintained by the king, according to his quality; but he &s;hall not return without being recalled. The archbi&s;hop exhorted them to embrace the&s;e offers, in order to avoid ruin and extirpation; and plainly told them, that, in ca&s;e of their refu&s;al, he &s;hould be obliged to lay them under the &s;entence of excommunication. To the&s;e propo&s;als Llewellyn an&s;wered,
<PB N="583" REF="5920">
that he was willing to &s;ubmit upon equitable terms; but that he could not agree to &s;uch articles, without laying a&s;ide all regard to his own &s;afety, and the welfare of his people, even though he &s;hould give up all con&s;iderations of honour and convenience. The Wel&s;h noblemen repre&s;ented, in behalf of their prince, that they would not agree to a peace, unle&s;s Edward would admit of a treaty concerning the four cantreds and the i&s;le of Angle&s;ey, the in|habitants of which dur&s;t not &s;ubmit to the king's mercy, becau&s;e he had ob|&s;erved no grant, covenant, or $$th, which he had even made with the prince and his &s;ubjects; and his officers had always tyrannized over the natives of Wales, with the utmo&s;t cruelty. David gave the archbi&s;hop to under|&s;tand, that when he &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed for &s;uch a pilgrimage, he would vi&s;it the Holy Land of his own free will, and not upon compul&s;ion; and that as he had taken up arms in defence of his life and liberty, he tru&s;ted that God would fight upon their &s;ide again&s;t the Engli&s;h, who had wantonly de&s;troyed their churches, profaned their &s;acraments, &s;lain their prie&s;ts at the altar, ma&s;|&s;acred their countrymen without di&s;tinction of age or &s;ex, and even murdered helple&s;s women in the act of &s;uckling their infants. The reader, who is not dazzled by the great talents and pro&s;perity of Edward, will plainly perceive from this detail, that he had injured and oppre&s;&s;ed this unfortunate people, without the lea&s;t provocation or &s;hadow of ju&s;tice, and connived at the out|rages of his officers, that the Wel&s;h might be driven to de&s;pair and rebellion, which would furni&s;h him with a pretext for reducing them to &s;lavery and &s;ubjection.</P>

<P>Llewellyn's an&s;wer was no &s;ooner brought to the archbi&s;hop, than<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 12$$.</NOTE> that prelate excommunicated the Wel&s;h prince and all his adherents; and$ in the beginning of the year, the king began to pro&s;ecute the war with vigour. It does not appear, however, that his endeavours were attended with his u&s;ual &s;ucce&s;s. In the cour&s;e of this campaign he was wor&s;ted in &s;everal &s;kir|mi&s;hes, with the lo&s;s of many per&s;ons of di&s;tinction; and, in the autumn, having returned to the ca&s;tle of Ruthland, he i&s;&s;ued writs for convoking two extraordinary councils, and the &s;ame number of &s;ynods, in the &s;outh and north of England, in order to deliberate upon more effectual means for carrying on the enterprize which he had undertaken. Mean while he marched with a great army towards the i&s;le of Angle&s;ey, and pa&s;&s;ed the river Conway on a bridge of boats: then his forces were tran&s;ported, by the fleet of the Cinque-Ports, to the i&s;land, which immediately &s;ubmitted to his dominion. From hence he cau&s;ed another bridge of boats to be laid acro&s;s the river Menay to the continent at Bangor; and, before this was completed, three hundred men at arms, under the command of lord William Latimer and Lucas de Thony, pa&s;&s;ed over to &s;ignalize their courage again&s;t the enemy. As &s;oon as the tide flowed in beyond the end of the bridge, the Wel&s;h poured down from the mountains with hideous out$ries, and attacked them in &s;uch a manner that they were immediately routed, and either killed, or d$owned in the river. Fifteen knights, two and thirty e&s;quires, and about a thou&s;and common &s;ol|diers peri&s;hed upon this occa&s;ion; indeed not one of the whole detachment e&s;caped but lord William Latimer, who&s;e hor&s;e &s;wam with him acro&s;s the channel. The Engli&s;h were &s;o di&s;heartened at this de$eat, that they neither fini&s;hed the bridge, nor proceeded with any other operation in that quarter.

At the &s;ame time the earl of Glouce&s;ter obtained a victory over the inhabi|tants of South Wales, though not without con&s;iderable lo&s;s; and, a$ter the earl's retreat, the prince of Wales ravaged the country of Cardigan, together with the lands belonging to Re&s;e ap Meredith, who &s;erved the king again&s;t his own countrymen.</P>

<P>Llewellyn and his adherents were &s;o much elevated with the ad|vantage they had gamed at the bridge, that they began to think heaven had declared in their favour; and that this prince was the per&s;on pointed out by one of the prophecies of Merlin, as the re&s;torer of Brute's empire in Britain: a &s;ooth&s;ayer had al&s;o progno&s;ticated that he &s;hould ride through the &s;treets of London with a crown upon his head. Thes$ ridiculous circum&s;tances had great weight with a &s;uper&s;titious people, who per&s;uaded Llewellyn to leave his brother David for the defence of Snowdun, and hazard a deci&s;ive battle again&s;t the Engli&s;h. With this view he marched into Radnor&s;hire, and, pa&s;&s;ing the river Wye, encountered a body of forces, commanded by Edmund Mortimer and John Giffard: Llewellyn him&s;elf, attended by one e&s;quire, had withdrawn from his army, to confer with &s;ome lords of that country, who had promi&s;ed to meet him in a private valley; and, in his ab&s;ence, the troops which he had po&s;ted at the bridge of Orewyn, were attacked and defeated by the Engli&s;h. The prince, in returning to rally his men, was killed by Adam de Francton, who, without knowing Llewellyn, ran a &s;pear through his heart; but after|wards<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1282.</NOTE> recognizing his countenance, &s;evered the head from the body, and car|rried it to the king, who was then quartered at the abbey of Conway. Edward &s;ent it immediately to London, where it was received with uncommon de|mon&s;trations of joy: the citizens carried it through Cheap&s;ide, upon the point of a lance, decorated with a &s;ilver circlet or crown, in order to fulfil the pre|diction of the &s;ooth&s;ayer; then it was placed in the pillory, that the inhabi|tants might glut their eyes with &s;uch an agreeable &s;pectacle; and afterwards, being crowned with a chaplet of ivy, it was expo&s;ed on the highe&s;t part of the Tower of London. Such a barbarous triumph over the body of a brave<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch.

<P>The Wel&s;h were &s;o di&s;pirited at the death of their beloved prince, that they made very little re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the forces of Edward, who, hav|ing fini&s;hed the bridge over the river Menay, penetrated into Snowd$n, where the ca&s;tle of that name, and &s;everal other fortre&s;&s;es, were immediately re|duced. David, who a&s;&s;umed the title of prince upon his brother's death, endeavoured to renew the war, and recover the principality; but the &s;ame &s;uper&s;tition that formerly animated his followers, now contributed to their de&s;|pondence: they either de&s;erted his cau&s;e, or &s;erved with fear and reluctance; &s;o that they were ea&s;ily defeated; and David being abandoned, was obliged<NOTE PLACE="marg">An$ Ch 1283.</NOTE> to conceal him&s;elf from the pur&s;uit of his enemy. At length one of his own c$u$trymen, employed as a &s;py by the king, di&s;covered the place of his retreat, where he was taken and brought to Edward, at Ruthland ca&s;tle. He earne&s;tly begged $span$ be admitted into the king's pre&s;ence; but this favour was d$nied. $span$ ordered him to be conveyed to Che&s;ter ca&s;tle; and, in the $span$ writs to convene the lords and commons at Shrew&s;bury,

where the pri&s;oner was tried and condemned as a traitor, to be drawn, hanged, and quartered; a &s;entence which was literally executed with cir|cum&s;tances of cruelty, never practi&s;ed before in any civilized country. His bowels were burned, his quarters expo&s;ed in the chief cities of England, and his head was placed upon the Tower, by that of his brother Llewellyn. Im|mediately after David was taken, Re&s;e ap Vaughan, a nobleman of South Wales, and all his adherents, &s;urrendered to the earl of Hereford, and were committed pri&s;oners to the Tower of London. Edward built two &s;trong ca&s;tles at Aberconway and Caernarvon; the whole principality of Wales &s;ub|mitted to his &s;way, and received the Engli&s;h laws; and then making a pro|gre&s;s<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch.

<P>The parliament, at Acton-Burnel in Shrop&s;hire, granted a con&s;ider|able aid to defray the expence of this war; and here al&s;o was enacted the &s;tatute known by the name of the place, enabling merchants to recover their debts by recognizances, in the three great cities of London, York, and Bri&s;tol: but the ordinances for the incorporation of Wales with England were made at Ruthland, which was the place of the king's re&s;idence during this whole expedition. He divided North Wales into counties, and appointed &s;heriffs and other officers, &s;uch as admini&s;tered ju&s;tice in England; but he decreed, that the Wel&s;h &s;hould not be &s;ued for debts and tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, except in their own country. He erected Ruthland, Caernarvon, Abery&s;twith, and other towns, into corporations, and endowed them with privileges to encou|rage trade, and allure the Wel&s;h from their mountains into a more &s;ociable way of life, that they might reap the &s;weets of indu&s;try, which would &s;oon divert their attention from &s;chemes of war and rebellion. He publi&s;hed a proclamation, offering peace and &s;ecurity to all tho&s;e who would put them|&s;elves into his protection. He left them in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame lands and liberties they had enjoyed under their own princes; but with re&s;pect to the bards, who kept up the &s;pirit of their countrymen by rehear&s;ing the glorious deeds of their ance&s;tors, he ordered them to be put to death, without mercy, as the &s;owers of &s;edition: another in&s;tance to prove how little Edward was re|&s;tricted by the ties of ju&s;tice and humanity, when they chanced to interfere with his ambition. Notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e precautions of indulgence and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1284.</NOTE> &s;everity, he could neither reconcile the Wel&s;h to his government, nor tame them into quiet &s;ubjection: they could not bear the thoughts of obeying a foreign prince, and &s;eeing their antient laws and cu&s;toms aboli&s;hed in favour of new regulations, which they did not under&s;tand, impo&s;ed upon them by a people whom they dete&s;ted as their inveterate enemies. Edward, in order to flatter their vanity, and amu&s;e their &s;uper&s;tition, is &s;aid to have left his queen to be delivered in the ca&s;tle of Caernarvon; and afterwards to have pre&s;ented young Edward, the fruit of that delivery, to the Wel&s;h lords, as a native of their country, who could not &s;peak a word of the Engli&s;h language. How childi&s;h &s;oever &s;uch an expedient may &s;eem to the unprejudiced reader, it might have &s;ucceeded very effectually, in tho&s;e days of ignorance, among a people who were &s;wayed by &s;uch trifling con&s;iderations, even in affairs of the greate&s;t importance. They con&s;idered this young prince as a native of Snow|dun, who would govern them as a di&s;tinct people from the Engli&s;h, as the

<P>Having taken proper mea&s;ures for pre&s;erving the tranquillity of Wales, he repaired to Bri&s;tol, and re&s;tored to its citizens the charter which they had for$eited by invading the rights of the con&s;table of the ca&s;tle. About<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1285.</NOTE> this time he was &s;trongly &s;ollicited by the king of France, to engage with him in a war again&s;t Peter king of Arragon, who was excommunicated by the pope, and, as far as eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ure would extend, deprived of his domi|nions, which his holine&s;s be&s;towed upon Charles count of Valois, younger &s;on of Philip the Hardy. This prince accepted of the pope's pre&s;ent, in the name of his &s;on, and began to make great preparations for invading Arragon. He not only invited Edward to join him in this expedition, but al&s;o &s;um|moned him as duke of Guienne. The king of England did not approve of the pope's a&s;&s;uming a power to dethrone princes; be&s;ides, he lived on terms of friend&s;hip with Peter, and had contracted an alliance with him touching a match between their children. He fore&s;aw that his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Guienne would have become very precarious, &s;hould Arragon have fallen into the hands of the French king; he therefore refu&s;ed to embark in the expedition. Neverthele&s;s Philip earne&s;tly de&s;ired a conference; and Edward had proceeded as far as Canterbury, in his way to France, when he was overtaken by a me&s;|&s;enger with the news of his mother's illne&s;s: he forthwith returned to vi&s;it her at Ambre&s;bury, and &s;ent an apology to Philip, who afterwards renewed his<NOTE PLACE="marg">$y$$r.</NOTE> &s;ollicitations; but he could not prevail upon Edward to undertake the voyage. The king having pa&s;&s;ed the Lent in devotion at St. Edmund&s;bury, returned to London, which he entered in triumph: but the citizens had no great rea&s;on to rejoice at his arrival; for he deprived them of their charter and mayor, and appointed a guardian, by whom they were ruled for ten years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. The rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for this deprivation, was the mayor's con|niving at the fraud of a certain baker; though this is &s;uch a frivolous pre|tence, that we mu&s;t look for another cau&s;e, which, in all probability, was the inveterate grudge that the king bore to the city, from his earlie&s;t youth, on account of its attachment to the earl of Leice&s;ter, and the in&s;ults which his mother &s;u&s;tained from the inhabitants. Immediately after Ea&s;ter he held a parliament at We&s;tmin&s;ter, in which &s;ome antient charters were exemplified and confirmed, and the &s;tatute of We&s;tmin&s;ter I. with &s;ome others, was in|troduced as a law into Ireland. At the next meeting, a fortnight after Mid|&s;ummer, &s;everal provi&s;ions were made to enforce the &s;tatute of Glouce&s;ter; amend and confirm laws which had lain dormant during the troubles of the kingdom; prevent the alienation of lands belonging to mona&s;teries; and to $$rrect &s;$ndry abu&s;es, mentioned in the&s;e regulations, which are known by the name of the &s;$$tute of We&s;tmin&s;ter II.

<P>While Edward thus exerted the abilities of a wi&s;e legi&s;lator, Philip king of France a&s;&s;embled an army of one hundred thou&s;and hor&s;e and foot, and entering Rou&s;&s;illon, reduced Perpignan and Elna; while Peter, unable to cope with him in battle, acted upon the defen&s;ive, by guarding the pa&s;&s;es, and endeavouring to cut off the enemy's convoys. Gironne, which Philip<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1286.</NOTE> inve&s;ted in the latter end of June, was valiantly defended by Raimond de Car|dona for ten weeks, during which the French army was ruined by the exce&s;|&s;ive heat and &s;carcity of provi&s;ion; for the place was at too great a di&s;tance from the &s;ea, for the be&s;iegers to be &s;upplied by their fleet, which lay at anchor in the bay of Ro&s;es. This fleet being divided into two &s;quadrons, one of them was encountered at &s;ea by Marquet, the admiral of Arragon, who took thirty of the French gallies; and the other was &s;urprized and ruined in the bay of Ro&s;es by Doria, who commanded the other divi&s;ion of the Arrago|nian fleet. As the French could no longer &s;ub&s;i&s;t in Catalonia, and Philip him&s;elf was attacked by a dy&s;entery, he retired to Rou&s;&s;illon, and died at Monte&s;quiou, after having lo&s;t a great number of men in this retreat; during which he was continually harra&s;&s;ed by Peter, who did not, however, long &s;urvive his &s;ucce&s;s; for he died in November, and was &s;ucceeded in his two kingdoms of Arragon and Sicily, by his two &s;ons Alphon&s;o and James. Philip the Fair &s;ucceeding to his father's crown, found him&s;elf engaged in a double war with Arragon and Ca&s;tile: he had but ju&s;t attained the age of &s;eventeen, and being de&s;irous of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing in quiet the kingdom of Navarre, which he enjoyed in right of his wife, he &s;ollicited the mediation of Edward king of England towards a peace with tho&s;e two potentates, who were allied to the Engli&s;h monarch. Edward accepted the office of mediator, &s;ent pro|po&s;als of accommodation to both kings; conferences were immediately begun, and the king having &s;ettled the affairs of the nation, in a parliament held immediately after Ea&s;ter, &s;et out for Paris about the middle of May, leaving the guardian&s;hip of the kingdom in his ab&s;ence, to his cou&s;in Edmund earl of Cornwall. He &s;oon concluded a truce between the powers at war; and, in con&s;ideration of his good offices, Philip indulged him with an exemption for life, from all penalty and forfeiture on account of appeals, from him&s;elf or his mini&s;ters, to the court of the French monarch, to whom he now did homage for the territories he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in that kingdom. A new treaty was ra|tified, confirming the la&s;t which had been concluded at Amiens: and then, repairing to Guienne, he convoked an a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates, to make &s;ome whol&s;ome regulations for the advantage of a country, which had lately mani|f$&s;ted uncommon zeal for his &s;ervice, in contributing both troops and money towards the conque&s;t of Wales. Neverthele&s;s, his gratitude to the Ga&s;cons did not prevent his putting to death the ringleaders of &s;ome turbulent indivi|duals of Bourdeaux, who had entered into a con&s;piracy for &s;urrendering that city to the French king. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tyrrel.</NOTE></P>

<P>Mean while a rebellion was rai&s;ed by Re&s;e ap Meredith, a power|ful nobleman in South Wales, who had &s;erved the king in the late war again&s;t his own countrymen. Edward had knighted him for his valour and fidelity, which he promi&s;ed to reward more effectually with the grant of certain lands and preferments. This promi&s;e was never performed, and Re&s;e became of con&s;equence a malecontent; yet he did not expre&s;s his di&s;gu&s;t, until he was &s;ummoned to appear in the king's court, by Payne Tiptoft, warden of the king's ca&s;tles, in that country. Meredith re&s;ented this citation, which was contrary to the antient privilege he enjoyed: a quarrel en&s;ued, and &s;everal &s;kirmi&s;hes were fought, with various &s;ucce&s;s, to the great annoyance of the neighbourhood. The king, appri&s;ed of the&s;e di&s;putes, wrote a letter to Re&s;e, commanding him to de&s;i&s;t from &s;uch violent mea&s;ures; but, in&s;tead of obey|ing this order, he &s;urprized divers ca&s;tles, and reduced &s;everal towns to a&s;hes. Then the earl of Cornwal &s;ummoned the military tenants of the crown; and, marching into Wales, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Dro&s;tan, the &s;tronge&s;t fortre&s;s belonging to Re&s;e, who retired to the woods, from whence he made incur|&s;ions into the adjacent country, and, falling upon detached parties of the Engli&s;h army, by &s;urprize, de&s;troyed &s;uch a number of men, that the earl of Cornwal was glad to conclude a truce, and return with di&s;grace from a very expen&s;ive expedition. Meredith, however, without regarding this agreement, renewed his depredations, until lord Robert Tiptoft a&s;&s;embled a body of forces, with which he routed this Wel&s;h nobleman in the field, and then &s;et a price upon his head; &s;o that, finding his life un&s;afe in his own country, he with|drew him&s;elf into Ireland, where he re&s;ided upon the e&s;tate of the earl of Glou|ce&s;ter, who in private had connived at his practices. After having re&s;ided four years in that kingdom, he returned to Wales, where he was di&s;covered and apprehended among the mountains; then he was conveyed to the king at<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch. T.

<P>The king &s;till continued at Bourdeaux, labouring at an accommo|dation between the king of Arragon and Charles prince of Salerno, who had been taken pri&s;oner in a &s;ea-engagement by Doria, the Arragonian admiral.
<PB N="589" REF="5980">
At length Alphon&s;o agreed to relea&s;e Charles, provided he would relinqui&s;h Sicily, Rhegio, the tribute of Tunis, and procure a revocation of all the mea|&s;ures which the court of Rome had taken to the prejudice of the hou&s;e of Ar|ragon. This treaty was condemned and declared null by pope Honorius IV. who died in the cour&s;e of this year. He entertained &s;anguine hopes from the armament of the count d'Artois, who had formed the de&s;ign of recovering Sicily, and actually invaded that i&s;land: but his attempt proved very un&s;uc|ce&s;sful; his fleet was &s;urprized, and the greate&s;t part of it taken by Doria, and his forces were obliged to retire with great lo&s;s to Italy. The &s;ee of Rome was, after a year's vacancy, filled with Nicholas V. who de&s;ired the king of Eng|land to procure the enlargement of Charles, before the treaty &s;hould be exe|cuted. For this purpo&s;e, Edward propo&s;ed that the prince of Salerno &s;hould<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1288.</NOTE> be &s;et at liberty, on giving his own three &s;ons and tho&s;e of forty noblemen in Provence as ho&s;tages, together with &s;ecurity for &s;eventy thou&s;and marks and the delivery of Provence, in ca&s;e he &s;hould not perform articles, or fail of re|turning within three years to his confinement. Edward not only propo&s;ed this expedient, but al&s;o took a journey to Iacca in Arragon, in order to facilitate the treaty, which was at la&s;t ratified; and then Charles obtained his liberty. But he paid very little regard to the agreement; for he no &s;ooner arrived in Italy, than he was ab&s;olved of his oath by the pope, and crowned king of the two Sicilies, which he endeavoured to conquer by force of arms, in direct violation of the treaty. When &s;ummoned to return to his confinement in Arragon, he marched to the frontiers of that kingdom, at the head of an army, in order to evade his promi&s;e: but another treaty was afterwards concluded, with the con|&s;ent of the pope, on condition that Alphon&s;o &s;hould not a&s;&s;i&s;t his brother James king of Sicily; and that Charles &s;hould renounce all claim to the kingdom of Arragon. This accommodation was followed by the death of Alphon&s;o, ju&s;t when he was about to marry Eleanor the daughter of Edward; and the king|doms of Arragon and Sicily being united under his brother James, the prince of Salerno found it a very difficult ta&s;k to execute his de&s;igns upon the la&s;t of the&s;e realms. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>Edward was &s;o much engro&s;&s;ed by his &s;chemes on the continent, that he &s;eemed to look upon England as a &s;econdary con&s;ideration. He had now re&s;ided in Guienne about three years, during which he had expended con|&s;iderable &s;ums of Engli&s;h money upon the continent; at length his finances being exhau&s;ted, he ordered the bi&s;hop of Ely his trea&s;urer to demand a &s;ub|&s;idy; and a parliament or great council of the nobility, being a&s;&s;embled at We&s;tmin&s;ter, he &s;ignified the king's plea&s;ure: but the earl of Glouce&s;ter, in<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Edward, &s;tartled at the peremptory refu&s;al of his nobility, thought it high time to return to England, which he found in great confu&s;ion, occa&s;ioned by the inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion of the judges and officers of the crown, while the nation was expo&s;ed to the depredations of armed banditti, who &s;et the laws at defiance.

<P>Having performed this act of reformation in behalf of the peo|ple, he, in two parliaments convened after the fea&s;ts of St. Hilary and Ea&s;ter, enacted &s;ome laws for the advantage of the nobility: the&s;e were contained in<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch 1290.</NOTE> the &s;tatute of We&s;tmin&s;ter III. They &s;ecured to lords paramount their rights in the marriages, ward&s;hips, and e&s;cheats of their va&s;&s;als, of which they had been long defrauded by the practice of feofments. He likewi&s;e pa&s;&s;ed the Quo Warranto, e&s;tabli&s;hing all the liberties which had been allowed in the preced|ing reign, enjoyed from time immemorial, or expre&s;ly contained in charters. The manner of levying fines was regulated on this occa&s;ion; and Edward, in order to conci$ate the affection of his &s;ubjects, and con&s;ult his own intere&s;t at the &s;ame time, publi&s;hed a proclamation for bani&s;hing all the Jews for ever out of the kingdom. They had rendered them&s;elves equally odious to the Engli&s;h, by their u&s;ury and by their religion; they were ordered to quit the kingdom on pain of death, before the fir&s;t day of November; and in the mean time, all their effects were confi&s;cated to the king, except as much money as would defray the expence of their voyage to the continent. He furni&s;hed them likewi&s;e with a &s;afe-conduct, in contempt of which they were plundered by the &s;eamen of the Cinque-Ports of the pittance they &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and of fifteen thou&s;and who obeyed the king's mandate, &s;ome hundreds were drowned out of mere wantonne&s;s of inhumanity. Be&s;ides the great &s;ums ari&s;ing from the confi&s;cation of their effects, the clergy were &s;o well plea&s;ed with the expul&s;ion of tho&s;e enemies to chri&s;tianity, that they granted a tenth of their benefices to the king, and afterwards joined with the nobility in obliging him with a fifteenth of their temporalities, to make &s;ome amends for the lo$s he &s;u&s;tained by the exile of the Jews, from whom he and his predece&s;&s;ors had exacted con&s;iderable<NOTE PLACE="marg">Knyghton.</NOTE> &s;ub&s;idies in the emergency of affairs.</P>

<P>This expul&s;ion was followed by the marriage of Gilbert earl of Glouce&s;ter with Edward's daughter Jane, which was &s;olemnized in April, after that powerful nobleman had obliged him&s;elf by oath to maintain the lineal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown of England. In July her &s;i&s;ter Beatrix was married to the elde&s;t &s;on of John duke of Brabant: but the &s;atisfaction ari&s;ing from the&s;e alliances was &s;oon damped, by the lamented death of queen Elea|nor, which happened in the cour&s;e of this year, in the neighbourhood of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ryme$.</NOTE> Grantham in Lincoln&s;hire. When Edward took the cro&s;s in Guienne, the pope immediately declared him general in chief of the cru&s;ade; but he was de|termined again&s;t embarking in &s;uch an expedition, without a proper fund for maintaining an army equal to the importance of &s;uch an enterprize. He de|manded the tenths of all eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland, to be levied for twelve years, together with all the charitable con|tributions that &s;hould be rai&s;ed during that period by his own &s;ubjects, for the r$lief of Pale&s;tine, as well as a moiety of what &s;hould be collected in the terri|tories of other princes, who had not engaged per&s;onally in the cru&s;ade.

danger of being intirely lo&s;t, Nicholas V. complied with the &s;ub&s;tance of his demand; fixed the time of the general embarkation, and i&s;&s;ued orders for rai&s;ing the tenths of the &s;econd &s;ix years in England. For this purpo&s;e, he directed his commi&s;&s;ioners to form a new valuation of all benefices, which is called the taxation of pope Nicholas; and was afterwards generally followed in the like a&s;&s;e&s;sments. Edward now declared his re&s;olution to &s;et out for Pa|le&s;tine at the time appointed; but before that arrived, Acra was lo&s;t, and the Holy Land entirely conquered by the Saracens: di&s;a&s;ters which put an end to all tho&s;e wild projects of enthu&s;ia&s;m and papal ambition, which had robbed Europe of infinite trea&s;ure and an incredible number of men, to the un&s;peak|able prejudice of the different countries to which they belonged. But even if<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prynne$</NOTE> tho&s;e misfortunes had not happened to the chri&s;tians in Pale&s;tine, Edward, in all probability, would have been hindered from embarking in the enterprize, by the troubles of Scotland, in which he was much more deeply intere&s;ted, and by which his attention was chiefly engro&s;&s;ed during the remaining part of his life.</P>

<P>Alexander III. king of Scotland had died by a fall from his hor&s;e, leaving no i&s;&s;ue but Margaret, married to Eric king of Norway; and &s;he was daughter to Margaret &s;i&s;ter of king Edward. She did not long &s;urvive her fa|ther, and dying left only one child of her own name, commonly called the Maid of Norway. This infant was acknowleged heire&s;s of the crown of Scot|land in a full parliament of that kingdom, who proclaimed her acce&s;&s;ion, and appointed guardians of the realm during her ab&s;ence. Edward projected an union of England and Scotland, by means of a match between his &s;on and this prince&s;s, which was agreeable to Eric, and approved by the guardians of Scotland, in a treaty at Sali&s;bury, where it was agreed between the king of England, Eric of Norway, and the Scotti&s;h deputies, that Margaret &s;hould be &s;ent to Scotland, as &s;oon as the guardians &s;hould give &s;ecurity that they would not di&s;po&s;e of her in marriage, without the con&s;ent of her father and great uncle. As prince Edward was related to Margaret within the prohibited degrees of con&s;anguinity, there was a nece&s;&s;ity for obtaining a di&s;pen&s;ation from the pope, which was immediately granted upon the king's paying the arrears of the tribute which had been for &s;ome years neglected. The guardians and parliament of Scotland &s;ent letters to Edward, congratulating him upon the removal of this ob&s;truction, expre&s;&s;ing their earne&s;t de&s;ire of &s;eeing the marriage completed, and &s;ignifying their re&s;olution of &s;ending deputies to the Engli&s;h parliament, to give their con&s;ent to this alliance, and regulate all the mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary for carrying it into execution. At the &s;ame time they wrote to the king of Norway, de&s;iring him to &s;end his daughter to England with all convenient expedition. Commi&s;&s;ioners were appointed to treat with the Scotti&s;h deputies; and the treaty of marriage was concluded on the fol|lowing &s;tipulations: That Scotland &s;hould for ever enjoy all its antient rights, liberties, and cu&s;toms; and the crown revert to the next heirs, free and inde|pendent, in ca&s;e Edward and Margaret &s;hould die without i&s;&s;ue: That Scot|land &s;hould remain &s;eparate from England by its e&s;tabli&s;hed boundaries: That the chapters of cathedral, collegiate, and conventual churches, &s;hould enjoy the freedom of election, without being obliged to go out of the kingdom, to a&s;k Conges d'Elire, pre&s;ent their elect, or take an oath of fealty to the king of

The crown of Scot|land was claimed by twelve competitors, and the nation divided into as many factions for the &s;upport of their different preten&s;ions: the guardians would not pre&s;ume to decide a di&s;pute of &s;uch importance; the nobility in parliament could not agree in their opinions; and the deci&s;ion by a majority would have been of very dangerous con&s;equence to the kingdom, as the minority would certainly have kindled a civil war in the bowels of their country.

Both<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> &s;ides are guilty of a wilful or involuntary mi&s;take; the Engli&s;h in pretending to a &s;uperiority over all Scotland, becau&s;e it extended over part of that king|dom; and the Scots in affirming the homage of their kings was payed for Cumberland, whereas in fact it was the Cumbrian kingdom, otherwi&s;e called Valentia, extending over the &s;hires of Kyle, Cunningham, Carrick, Renfrew, and Galloway, that antiently depended upon the crown of England. This country, inhabited by Britons, was intirely conquered and reduced by Edmund, who be&s;towed it upon Malcolm I. king of Scotland, as a fief to be held in fealty of the crown of England, by the &s;ervice of guarding the Northumbrian territories from the inva&s;ion of enemies: Malcolm renewed his oath of fealty to Edred, who &s;ucceeded his brother; Edinburgh was granted by Edgar to Indulf king of Scotland; and to this was afterwards added Lothian, compre|hending the country between the Tweed and the Forth, which Kenneth III. received upon the terms of homage and va&s;&s;alage to the crown of England. While the father did homage for this acce&s;&s;ion of territory, his &s;on Malcolm &s;wore fealty to Edgar for the Cumbrian principality, as heir apparent of the Scotti&s;h throne; Duncan, grand&s;on to Malcolm II. made the like &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Canute; and Malcolm III. during the u&s;urpation of Macbeth, found a &s;afe retreat in this Cumbrian kingdom. Thither too Fleance fled for refuge after the murder of his father; and marrying the daughter of one of tho&s;e Briti&s;h Reguli, tran&s;mitted the inheritance of Galloway to his po&s;terity. Mal|colm did homage to William the Conqueror, though he did not po&s;&s;e&s;s one acre of land in England; con&s;equently this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion mu&s;t have related to the country of Lothian, the grant of which was confirmed to him by that monarch. He afterwards recognized his va&s;&s;alage to William Rufus; and his &s;ucce&s;&s;or Edgar, in a charter to the church of Durham, acknowledged that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the county of Lothian by the grant of his lord, William king of England. David I. attended as a peer or va&s;&s;al of England at the courts and councils of his brother-in-law Henry I. and &s;wore to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Maude the Empre&s;s; Malcolm IV. did the &s;ame homage to Henry II. with a clau&s;e &s;aving his royal dignity; the &s;ame homage and fealty was payed and &s;worn by his brother and &s;ucce&s;&s;or William, at a time when he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no lands in England. We have already mentioned his captivity and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his conqueror, of whom he agreed to hold the kingdom of Scotland and all his other territories by liege homage and fealty: from this convention, though ratified by the parliament of Scotland, he was afterwards relea&s;ed by king Richard, who con&s;ented to receive his homage as it had been payed by his predece&s;&s;or Malcolm. He in the &s;equel &s;wore fealty to John at Lincoln, with the &s;aving clau&s;e, which was al&s;o retained in the homage done by his &s;ucce&s;&s;or Alexander II. to Henry III. at Northampton. When Alexander III. &s;olemnized his nuptials at York, he

From this &s;hort hi&s;torical deduction, it plainly appears that the Engli&s;h claim too much, and the Scots give up too little; that the kings of Scotland enjoyed their an|tient dominions in their own right, without va&s;&s;alage or dependance; and that they derived the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Cumbrian kingdom of Strathcluyd, as well as Lothian, from the grants of Engli&s;h monarchs, on condition of paying homage and &s;ervice for &s;uch conce&s;&s;ions.</P>

<P>Edward in all likelihood was very well acquainted with the&s;e par|ticulars, as he had ordered inquiries to be made on this &s;ubject, that he might be ma&s;ter of all the arguments and precedents that could be advanced in fa|vour of his claim; but he depended much more upon the influence of his ar|bitration, which he knew would enable him to obtain a recognition of his &s;u|periority from the competitors to the throne and their adherents. In a word, we may &s;afely affirm that he was determined at all events to &s;ubdue the whole kingdom to his &s;way, and for that purpo&s;e to manage the different factions into which it was divided. He had already made a conque&s;t of Wales, and the reduction of Scotland would have rounded his dominions. Could he have made him&s;elf unrivalled lord of Great Britain, he might with more advantage have pro&s;ecuted his de&s;igns upon the continent. Actuated by tho&s;e principles, he convened the claimants and nobility of Scotland at Norham on the river Tweed, where the conferences were opened; and in a general a&s;&s;embly, which met in the pari&s;h church, Roger de Braban&ccedil;on ju&s;ticiary of England declared to the competitors and Scotti&s;h nobility, that king Edward was come to quiet the troubles of their country, to do ju&s;tice between man and man, and take cognizance of the di&s;pute concerning the crown, by virtue of his own right of &s;uperiority over the kingdom of Scotland, which he now required them to ac|knowledge. They were not a little a&s;toni&s;hed at this propo&s;al; but being &s;ur|rounded by a &s;trong body of forces, a&s;&s;embled to overawe their deliberations, they dur&s;t not avow their &s;entiments: though they de&s;ired time to con&s;ult with the prelates and nobility that were ab&s;ent, before they would declare them&s;elves on a &s;ubject of &s;uch importance. Edward told them he expected their an&s;wer next day, when they made the &s;ame objection; and were indulged with three weeks, within which they were required to prepare whatever they might have to &s;ay to the prejudice of his preten&s;ions. This term being expired, they a&s;&s;embled on a plain in the pari&s;h of Up&s;et-lynton, on the Scotti&s;h &s;ide of the Tweed, op|po&s;ite to the ca&s;tle of Norham, where the king re&s;ided. The bi&s;hop of Bath and Wells was &s;ent to know their re&s;olution, and demand whether they had any charter or evidence to produce again&s;t his claim of &s;uperiority and direct do|minion over the kingdom of Scotland. As they made no an&s;wer, he interpreted their &s;ilence into con&s;ent; and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Robert de Brus lord of Anandale, and one of the mo&s;t powerful of the competitors, a&s;ked if he would acknowledge Edward as &s;overeign of Scotland, and &s;tand to his award in that quality. Robert replied in the affirmative. The &s;ame que&s;tion was put to Florence count of Holland, and John Ha&s;tings, who replied to the &s;ame pur|po&s;e; then Patrick Dunbar earl of March, William de Ro&s;s, William
<PB N="595" REF="6040">
Ve&s;cy by proxy, Robert de Pinkney, and Nicholas Soules, appeared &s;everally to claim the crown of Scotland by the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and agreed to abide by the deci&s;ion of Edward, as lord paramount of that kingdom. John Baliol was ab&s;ent; but, at the reque&s;t of his proxy, the meeting was adjourned till next day, in the church of Norham, where he joined the other competitors in &s;igning a recognition of Edward's &s;uperiority. The king of England was well acquainted with the merits of the cau&s;e, and knew very well that the conte&s;t would be between Brus and Baliol; but, in order to keep the&s;e candi|dates dependent upon his will and &s;ub&s;ervient to his views, he encouraged and in all probability rai&s;ed up the other competitors. He naturally concluded that no individual among them would preclude him&s;elf from all hope of &s;uc|ce&s;s by di&s;obliging the arbitrator of his cau&s;e; but, le&s;t any one or all of them &s;hould prove refractory, he had prepared a very &s;trong body of militia to extort their conce&s;&s;ion; and when the Scotti&s;h nobility &s;eemed to boggle at his pro|po&s;al, he &s;wore by St. Edward that he would venture his life in the pro&s;e|cution of his right, which he pretended to demon&s;trate by irrefragable proofs, which were no other than a collection of exploded fables, extorted deeds of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and monki&s;h forgeries. The pains he took to &s;upport his claim<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr. Abingd.</NOTE> betrayed the weakne&s;s of his preten&s;ions. He could not produce one authentic voucher, except the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of William during his confinement, which Richard relinqui&s;hed in the &s;equel. His &s;overeignty being thus acknowleged by the competitors, including John de Cumin, who at this meeting gave in his claim, which was admitted among the re&s;t; it was agreed, by the no|blemen and prelates of both nations, that he &s;hould be enabled to execute his &s;entence, by granting the kingdom to him who &s;hould appear to have the be&s;t right; and for that purpo&s;e it was determined that he &s;hould be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the fortre&s;&s;es in the kingdom. This was a &s;train of complai&s;ance which mu&s;t have been in&s;pired by the mo&s;t abject fear, or the mo&s;t &s;ervile flattery, after he had publicly declared that although he acted in this di&s;pute as lord paramount of Scotland, he did not mean to de&s;i&s;t from his own preten&s;ions to the crown of that kingdom; but re&s;erved to him&s;elf the liberty of pro&s;ecuting his rights in &s;uch manner and at &s;uch time as he &s;hould think proper to adopt. How di&s;agreeable &s;oever this acknowlegement mu&s;t have been to the body of the Scotti&s;h nation, they were obliged to &s;ubmit to the tran&s;action: all their nobles were either cajoled by the promi&s;es or intimidated by the threats of Edward; and his troops hovered about the borders, ready to fall upon their country, &s;hould they manife&s;t the lea&s;t tendency to oppo&s;ition. Neverthele&s;s the regents thought it was incumbent upon them to obtain &s;ome &s;ort of &s;atisfaction for the people; and demanded letters patent from Edward, declaring that the di&s;pute &s;hould be decided within the kingdom of Scotland; a favour which he readily granted, at their humble reque&s;t, con&s;idering their demand as a fur|ther acknowlegement of his &s;overeignty. The&s;e previous mea&s;ures being taken, they re&s;olved to proceed to the examination of the claims; and the com|petitors agreed that forty per&s;ons &s;hould be named by Robert de Brus, as many by John Baliol and John Cumin, and four and twenty by king Edward, to inve&s;tigate the different preten&s;ions of the claimants, and make their report to the umpire, after having duly con&s;idered the circum&s;tances of the di&s;pute. The commi&s;&s;ioners being cho&s;en, the town of Berwick was pitched upon as the place of meeting, and the time limited to the &s;econd day of Augu&s;t. But,
<PB N="596" REF="6050">
before they quitted Norham, the regents of Scotland and the governors of the ca&s;tles &s;urrendered their commi&s;&s;ions to Edward, who re&s;tored them with &s;ome little alteration, and appointed the bi&s;hop of Caithnes high chan|ce$$or of the kingdom, a&s;&s;ociated with one of his own &s;ecretaries called Walter de Hamonde&s;ham. Orders were i&s;&s;ued for all tho&s;e who enjoyed po&s;ts in Scotland to come and take the oath of allegiance to king Edward, who in the mean time exacted it from the competitors and all pre&s;ent; and then repair|ing to Berwick, even before the commi&s;&s;ioners a&s;&s;embled, he publi&s;hed a de|claration, importing that although he had con&s;ented to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion's being decided within the kingdom of Scotland, he did not mean to re&s;trict him|&s;elf to the &s;ame conde&s;cen&s;ion on any future occa&s;ion. The commi&s;&s;ioners meet|ing at the appointed day, in pre&s;ence of his maje&s;ty, received the claims of the different competitors; but, as the chief conte&s;t lay between Baliol and Brus, we &s;ha$l wave the preten&s;ions of the others, and only ob&s;erve that the fir&s;t of the&s;e pretended to the crown, as &s;on of Devergild the elde&s;t daughter of Mar|garet, the fir&s;t born child of David earl of Huntingdon, brother to king Wil|liam, who&s;e po&s;terity was extinct in the per&s;on of the la&s;t queen Margaret. Robert de Brus alledged that he was in a nearer degree of con&s;anguinity, as being the grand&s;on of David, whereas his competitor was no more than the great grandchild; that Alexander II. had declared him his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, in ca&s;e he &s;hould die without i&s;&s;ue; and that Alexander III. had always looked upon him as his pre&s;umptive heir; a circum&s;tance that he could prove by the evi|dence of &s;everal per&s;ons who had heard him explain his &s;entiments on that &s;ub|ject. The different claims being read and reported, by the commi&s;&s;ioners to the king, he, with the con&s;ent of the competitors, prorogued the a&s;&s;embly to the month of June in the &s;ucceeding year, when he propo&s;ed they &s;hould pro|ceed<NOTE PLACE="marg">C$.

<P>This rece&s;s was owing to the death of Edward's mother, who was interred at Ambre&s;bury with great &s;olemnity, the king in per&s;on attending her funeral, with all the prelates and nobility of the kingdom. The fifteenth granted at the expul&s;ion of the Jews having been levied only in tho&s;e parts of England which were immediately &s;ubject to the crown, commi&s;&s;ions were i&s;&s;ued for a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it upon the counties palatine of Che&s;hire and Pembroke, the principality of Wales, and the e&s;tates belonging to the Engli&s;h nobility in Ireland. At the &s;ame time all who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed forty pounds a year in land were &s;ummoned to come and receive the honour of knighthood at Chri&s;tmas. Gil|bert earl of Glo$ce&s;ter had lately erected a ca&s;tle on the lands belonging to Humphrey Bohun earl of Hereford, who complaining of this injury in the king's court, Edward re&s;erved the cognizance of the cau&s;e to him&s;elf, and forbade the p$rties to violate the peace of the country. Notwith&s;tanding this injunction, Gilbert's va&s;&s;als invaded Humphrey's territories in Brecknock|&s;hire, with banner di&s;played, and ravaged the country. The&s;e depredations were retorted by Humphrey's tenants; abundance of blood&s;hed en&s;ued, and the whole neighbourhood was expo&s;ed to the calamities of civil war. The king i&s;&s;ued a &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion for inquiring into the facts, which were a&s;|certai$ed by a verdict of jurors: and the inque&s;t being returned to his maje&s;ty, the two earls were $$mmoned to Ambre&s;bury to an&s;wer for their contempt<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1292.</NOTE> of his inhibition. Another inquiry was begun before the king him&s;elf and his council at Abergaveny; and both earls being found guilty were taken into
<PB N="597" REF="6060">
cu&s;tody, and their liberties &s;eized into the king's hands. They were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed however upon giving bail for their appearance; and the cau&s;e being tried be|fore the council, the king pronounced &s;entence, by which the liberties of Gla|morgan and Brecknock were forfeited during the lives of the earls, who were &s;ent to pri&s;on till ran&s;omed at the king's plea&s;ure. Hereford compounded for a thou&s;and marks; but Glouce&s;ter, having been found the aggre&s;&s;or, was obliged to give &s;ecurity for paying ten times that &s;um before he could procure his liberty. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Carte.</NOTE></P>

<P>After the deci&s;ion of this affair, Edward made a progre&s;s through Suffolk, Norfolk, and other northern counties; and in the beginning of June arrived at Berwick, where the prelates and nobility of both kingdoms were a&s;&s;embled, with the commi&s;&s;ioners, for examining the claims of the com|petitors. At the very beginning of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, the amba&s;&s;adors of Norway demanded the crown for their ma&s;ter, as heir to his own daughter Margaret; and his claim was admitted among tho&s;e of the other pretenders, after they had in their king's name acknowledged Edward's right of &s;overeignty over Scotland. As the examination of &s;uch a number of claims was attended with tedious di&s;putes and di&s;qui&s;itions, which protracted the determination of the cau&s;e, the king propo&s;ed that they &s;hould begin with the preten&s;ions of Brus and Baliol, without prejudice to tho&s;e of the other claimants, which &s;hould be afterwards di&s;cu&s;&s;ed; but warm debates ari&s;ing among the commi&s;&s;ioners, about the laws and cu&s;toms, according to which the di&s;pute &s;hould be determined, Edward adjourned the a&s;&s;embly to October, when they unanimou&s;ly agreed that the judgment ought to be regulated according to the laws and cu&s;toms prevailing in the king's dominions; and that the kingdom of Scotland &s;hould be con&s;idered as an indivi&s;ible fief. Then Brus and Baliol were a&s;ked if they had any thing further to &s;ay in behalf of their re&s;pective claims, which they endeavoured to corroborate by &s;everal plau&s;ible arguments and explanations. The&s;e being di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, the king propo&s;ed the following que&s;tion, "Whether the more di&s;tant i&s;&s;ue of the elde&s;t, or nearer offspring of the &s;econd daughter, ought to be preferred?" And the commi&s;&s;ioners unanimou&s;ly an&s;wered, that according to the laws and cu&s;toms of both kingdoms, the de&s;cendant of the elde&s;t was pre&s;erable to the other. After this deci&s;ion, Edward ordered them to canvas the point in his hearing, and then declared he would give judgment on the &s;ixth day of November, when he &s;olemnly pronounced the claim of Robert de Brus defective; but as the exclu&s;ion of this competitor did not a&s;|certain the title of Baliol, he ordered the examiners to take cognizance of the other pretenders. The conte&s;t between Baliol and Brus being determined, John Ha&s;tings alledged that Scotland as a fief was divi&s;ible; and therefore ought to be divided among the three de&s;cendants of David earl of Hunting|don, who&s;e younge&s;t daughter was his mother. He was &s;econded in this claim by Robert de Brus, who now demanded a third part of the kingdom, as &s;on and heir of the &s;econd daughter. Edward again demanded of the com|mi&s;&s;ioners, whether or not Scotland was an indivi&s;ible fief; and they an&s;wering as before, he adjourned the a&s;&s;embly to the &s;eventeenth day of the month, when &s;ummoning all the competitors to appear and ju&s;tify their preten&s;ions, the amba&s;&s;adors of Norway, Florence of Holland, William de Ve&s;cy, Dunbar, Ro&s;s, Pinkeney, and Soules, withdrew their claims; John Cumin was non|&s;uited, becau&s;e he did not appear; and the king pronounced that John
<PB N="598" REF="6070">
Ha&s;tings and Robert de Brus had no title to any &s;hare of the kingdom of Scotland, which was a fief indivi&s;ible. Baliol therefore &s;tanding without com|petitor, was declared king of Scotland, though Edward re&s;erved to him&s;elf and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors the right of pro&s;ecuting their own preten&s;ions. Orders were immediately i&s;&s;ued for putting him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the kingdom; and he took the oath of fealty, acknowledging the &s;overeignty of Edward and his &s;ucce&s;|&s;ors over Scotland, in the mo&s;t explicit and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive terms, enacted into an authentic con&s;titution: then he was in&s;talled at Scone with the u&s;ual forma|lities; and all the noblemen of Scotland &s;wore allegiance to him, except<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$t. de $word$ Reg.

<P>The king of England &s;eemed impatient for an opportunity to manife&s;t that right of &s;overeignty which he had been at &s;uch pains to e&s;tabli&s;h.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1293.</NOTE> While he re&s;ided at Newca&s;tle, a burgher of Berwick complained of an injury he had received from certain Engli&s;h officers, who had been &s;ent upon &s;ome commi&s;&s;ion to Scotland; and he ordered the cau&s;e to be tried before his own judges in England. The council of Scotland, alarmed at this arbitrary in|junction, &s;ent deputies to remind him of his promi&s;e and engagement, by which he was re&s;trained from evoking Scotti&s;h cau&s;es before the tribunal of any other kingdom. To this remon&s;trance he replied, that he could not allow &s;uch a &s;uit to be tried before any judge but him&s;elf, as it did not become va&s;&s;als to correct the faults of tho&s;e who repre&s;ented the per&s;on of their &s;ove|reign. In order to anticipate &s;uch complaints for the future, he &s;ent a decla|ration to the council of Scotland, giving them to under&s;tand, that although, while their throne was vacant, he had made &s;ome occa&s;ional promi&s;es, which were performed, he did not mean to be re&s;tricted by tho&s;e conde&s;cen&s;ions, now that they had a king of their own; nor to depart from his right of judg|ing all affairs that concerned their kingdom, at any time or place that he &s;hould think proper. He expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the &s;ame terms at his own court, in pre&s;ence of Baliol and many noblemen of both nations; and, more|over, declared his intention of &s;ending for the king of Scotland into England, as often as he &s;hould deem his pre&s;ence nece&s;&s;ary or expedient. He pro|nounced the&s;e words in a tran&s;port of pa&s;&s;ion; &s;o that Baliol did not think proper to expo&s;tulate upon the &s;ubject with a prince of his imperious temper: but, in a few days, he had another opportunity of exerci&s;ing his patience; for Edward obliged him to renounce, by an authentic deed, for him&s;elf and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, all the promi&s;es, conce&s;&s;ions, and ratifications, made by the king of England, during the vacancy of the Scotti&s;h throne; and to approve of all the &s;teps he had taken in that period. This bitter draught, however, he &s;weetened by granting letters patent, in which he relinqui&s;hed all other right but that of homage to the crown of Scotland; and gave up for him&s;elf and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, all claim to the ward&s;hip of minors, as well as the prero|gative<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. Public.</NOTE> of marrying them, according to his plea&s;ure. The&s;e were not all the in&s;tances which Edward exhibited of his de&s;ign to exerci&s;e his right, in its ut|mo&s;t extent, over the kingdom of Scotland. A merchant of Ga&s;cony pre|&s;ented to him a memorial, in which he repre&s;ented that Alexander, the la&s;t
<PB N="599" REF="6080">
king of Scotland, was indebted to him for a &s;um of money, which the new king refu&s;ed to pay; and therefore he had recour&s;e for ju&s;tice to king Edward, as lord paramount of Scotland. In con&s;equence of this petition, Edward &s;ummoned the king of Scotland to appear in per&s;on, and an&s;wer the charge of the merchant, before his court at We&s;tmin&s;ter. In a few days after this cita|tion, Baliol received another, on account of Macduff earl of Fife, who had been impri&s;oned for &s;eizing &s;ome lands unju&s;tly, by order of the fir&s;t parlia|ment a&s;&s;embled at Scone, after John's elevation to the throne: he was no &s;ooner &s;et at liberty than he preferred his complaint to Edward, and Baliol was &s;ummoned to appear at a certain time and place. In the month of June, he was a third time cited upon the following &s;ubject: the king of England had ordered Walter de Huntercombe, governor of the i&s;le of Man, to put Baliol in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that i&s;land; but afterwards a lady called Au&s;triga, claimed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion as heir at law, and her preten&s;ions being rejected, &s;he ap|pealed to Edward. David king of Scotland had formerly granted to the mo|na&s;tery of Reading, a priory dependent on the bi&s;hopric of St. Andrew's, which was afterwards alienated by the abbot of Reading, in favour of the &s;ee which had been di&s;membered: a &s;ucceeding abbot pretended the alienation had been made without the con&s;ent of the monks, and pre&s;ented a petition to the king, de&s;iring it might be re&s;tored. The bi&s;hop appealed to the pope; and his appeal being admitted at the court of Scotland, the abbot complained to Edward, who &s;ummoned Baliol to appear before him per&s;onally, fifteen days after Martinmas. In the cour&s;e of the &s;ucceeding year, that prince was again ordered to appear before the king of England, to acquit him&s;elf of the charge of having refu&s;ed to do ju&s;tice to the bi&s;hop of Durham, in an affair relating to his dioce&s;e. From &s;uch a &s;eries of citations, upon the mo&s;t frivo|lous<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1294.</NOTE> occa&s;ions, Baliol comprehended that Edward's de&s;ign was to render him a &s;lave rather than a va&s;&s;al: but as he was in no condition to &s;hake off his de|pendence, he found him&s;elf obliged to obey tho&s;e orders, and an&s;wer in per&s;on for the mi&s;demeanours laid to his charge. When he was accu&s;ed before the Engli&s;h parliament of having unju&s;tly impri&s;oned the earl of Fife, he propo&s;ed to an&s;wer by proxy; but he was not allowed that privilege, and appeared at the bar as a private &s;ubject. He then pleaded, that as he acted from the right of regality, in that affair for which he was now &s;ummoned before the king, he could not make a defence without having previou&s;ly con&s;ulted his &s;ubjects: this plea was over-ruled, and the parliament ordained, that three of his be&s;t ca&s;tles &s;hould be &s;eized by the king, and kept until he &s;hould have given ample &s;atisfaction. Baliol, however, prevented this &s;entence, by acknowledg|ing the direct &s;overeignty of Edward over Scotland, and humbly petitioning for time to con&s;ult his own parliament. His reque&s;t was granted, and a day being fixed for his appearance, he withdrew full of indignation and chagrin. Edward's aim in humbling the king of Scots, was, in all probability, to provoke that prince to a revolt, which would furni&s;h him with a pretence to &s;ubdue the whole kingdom, and &s;eize the property of it into his own<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

<P>Baliol re&s;olved to take the fir&s;t opportunity of freeing him&s;elf from &s;uch a &s;hameful and &s;lavi&s;h dependence; and he derived hopes from a rupture, which about this time happened between France and England.
<PB N="600" REF="6090">
This took its ri&s;e from a petty quarrel between a few mariners of each nation, which afforded a pretext to the French king to &s;ummon Edward to his court of peers, to an&s;wer for the ho&s;tilities committed on the natives of France, by his &s;ubjects. Edward, apprehen&s;ive of a war, immediately detached John de St. John to defend Guienne; and, at the &s;ame time, &s;ent his brother, Edmund earl of Lanca&s;ter, to Paris, with full powers to treat of an accommodation. Philip in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;atisfaction for the affront he had received, in the per&s;ons of his officers, who had been maltreated in Guienne. A private treaty was brought on the carpet, for a marriage between the king of England and Margaret of France, daughter of the late king Philip the Hardy. By the articles of this alliance, it was &s;tipulated that the &s;on of this marriage &s;hould, after his father's decea&s;e, enjoy Guienne for him&s;elf and the heirs of his body; and, that if he &s;hould die without i&s;&s;ue, the country &s;hould revert to the crown of England. As the&s;e articles could not be executed without a new feofment of that dutchy to Edward for life; and for the u&s;es &s;pecified, after his decea&s;e, it was nece&s;|&s;ary that the French king &s;hould have &s;ei&s;in of the whole province. The marriage-contract being &s;igned and ratified by Edward, and the king of France having promi&s;ed, on the word of a king, to ob&s;erve all the &s;tipulations, the earl of Lanca&s;ter &s;ent orders to the governors of Guienne to put him in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole dutchy. After all the towns and fortre&s;&s;es had remained forty days in his cu&s;tody, re&s;titution was demanded, together with a &s;afe-con|duct for Edward, that he might go over and complete the marriage: but Philip refu&s;ed both the one and the other; and, as the king of England had not obeyed the citation, he was pronounced contumacious, and judgment given again&s;t him by default. This judgment, however, was waved, as being founded on a citation which had been annulled; and Philip i&s;&s;ued an|other, requiring Edward to appear at Paris in three weeks after Chri&s;tmas.</P>

For the more ea&s;y accompli&s;hment of this end, he engaged in alliances with his own &s;ons-in-law, Henry count of Barre and John duke of Brabant, Amadeus count of Savoy, Adolphus of Na&s;&s;au, king of the Romans; the archbi&s;hop of Cologne, the counts of Guelderland and Catzenellenbogen, and &s;ome noblemen of Burgundy, who promi&s;ed to make a diver&s;ion in the provinces of France: Guy count of Flanders likewi&s;e undertook to invade the French domi|nions; and he him&s;elf began to prepare a fleet to tran&s;port his own army to the continent. In order to defray the expence of this armament, an addi|tional duty was laid upon merchandize in England and Ireland; the prelates and clergy, in a convocation at We&s;tmin&s;ter, granted a moiety of all their<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat.

The&s;e preparations, however, did not produce the de&s;ired effect. John duke of Brabant was killed by accident at a tourna|ment: the noblemen of Burgundy were over-awed by Humbert, dauphin of the Viennois, who had entered into Philip's &s;ervice: he received no a&s;&s;i&s;tance

from the German princes, though they drained him of great &s;ums of money: Guy count of Flanders was arre&s;ted at Paris, whither he had been &s;ummoned on an appeal to the parliament: &s;ome thou&s;ands of pri&s;oners and banditti, who had been pardoned by Edward on condition of &s;erving in this war, de|&s;erted before their embarkation; and his pa&s;&s;age was delayed by contrary winds, from Mid&s;ummer to the beginning of September, when his departure was prevented by an in&s;urrection in Wales.</P>

<P>The natives of that country, driven to de&s;pair by the heavy taxes with which they were &s;addled, ran to arms; and, &s;eizing the collector, hanged him, with &s;ome of his followers: then they ravaged the country, ma&s;|&s;acring all the Engli&s;h who fell in their way. The&s;e revolters were headed in South Wales by one Morgan, in We&s;t Wales by Maelgun Vaughan, and in North Wales they were commanded by Madoc, a kin&s;man of their beloved prince Llewellyn. Morgan drove the earl of Glouce&s;ter out of the country; Maelgun over-ran Cardigan and Pembroke&s;hire; Madoc &s;urprized Caernar|von, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the ca&s;tle, and afterwards reduced Snowdun and Angle&s;ey. The earls of Lanca&s;ter and Lincoln were detached into North Wales, with part of the forces intended for the expedition into Ga&s;cony; and, having advanced as far as Denbigh, were attacked and defeated. Edward, alarmed at this in&s;urrection, marched thither in per&s;on; and, after divers ren|counters with the Wel&s;h, who fought de&s;perately, compelled them to retire to the mountains of Snowdun, to which the king penetrated, even in the winter &s;ea&s;on. Madoc was then obliged to quit his po&s;t, and try his fortune in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 12$5.</NOTE> Marches, where he obtained the advantage in &s;everal &s;kirmi&s;hes; but, being at la&s;t routed on the hills near Caurs ca&s;tle, he &s;ubmitted to Edward, and was &s;ent pri&s;oner to the Tower of London. His example was followed by almo&s;t all the Wel&s;h barons, who were impri&s;oned in different ca&s;tles. The re&s;t of the rebels were pardoned: but Edward declared that he would extir|pate the whole race, &s;hould they ever excite another rebellion. He ordered the town and ca&s;tle of Beaumaris to be rebuilt, great part of the woods in the inland parts to be cut down; and, erecting &s;ome fortre&s;&s;es on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, returned in the latter end of July to London. Morgan &s;till continued in arms in the county of Glamorgan, which held of the earl of Glouce&s;ter, who had rendered him&s;elf &s;o odious to the natives by his pride and tyranny, that the Wel&s;h noblemen refu&s;ed to obey his &s;uperiority, though they offered to &s;ubmit on condition of holding their lands of the crown of England. They were accordingly, with their leader Morgan, indulged in this re&s;pect, laid down their arms, took the oath of allegiance, and delivered ho&s;tages for their fidelity.</P>

<P>The king, when he &s;et out on the Wel&s;h expedition, had &s;ent over a body of forces to Guienne, under the command of his nephew John de Bretagne earl of Richmond, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by John de St. John, Robert de Tibetot, and other experienced officers. They &s;ailed up the river Garonne, and were received into Blaye and Bourg, which having &s;ecured with garri&s;ons, they pa&s;&s;ed by Bourdeaux, occupied by the con&s;table de Ne&s;le, and landed at Rions, which with St. Macaire &s;ubmitted without re&s;i&s;tance: then they ex|tended their quarters along the Dordogne, and were joined by almo&s;t all the barons of the country. John de St. John, at the head of a detachment, took
<PB N="602" REF="6110">
B$yonne, Sordes, and &s;ever$l other towns and fortre&s;&s;es; and, being rein|f$rced by a good number of Ga&s;con troops, marched to St. Sever, &s;eated on t$e Ado$r, and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the place on the &s;eventh day of April. By this time Charles count de Valois, brother to the king of France, had tak$n the fi$ld with a numerous army, reduced Poden&s;ac, and inve&s;ted Rions, in whi$h John de Bretagne and Robert de Tibetot commanded a &s;trong gar|ri&s;o$ of E$g$$$h and Ga$cons: neverthel$&s;s, they re&s;olved to quit the place; and t$e inhabit$nts w$re &s;o exa$perated at their intention of leaving them to the mercy of th$ir enemy, that an in&s;urrection en&s;ued: Charles, taking advantage o$ the tumult, entered the place, where he took a good number of Engl$$h knights who had not time to retreat on board of the &s;hipping. From this place the count de Valois marched to St. Sever; from whence St. John re|t$red at his approach to Bayonne, after having left H$gh de Vere, with a good g$rri$on in t$e place. This officer made a noble de$ence, and repul&s;ed the French in &s;o many a&s;&s;aults, that their army was almo&s;t ruined; till at length he was compelled by famine to &s;$rrender upon a very honourable capitulation. Charl$s &s;e$$red the town with a numerous and well &s;upplied body of troops; but he had no &s;ooner retired into France with the &s;h$ttered rem$ins of his<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> army, than St. Sever was re-taken by the Engli&s;h. Mean while the fleet of the Cinque-Ports di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the Fren$h commerce in &s;uch a mann$r, there was h$rdly a &s;hip of that nation which would vent$re to quit their harbours. But as the &s;$amen of the Cinque-Ports acted more like pirates th$n the regular &s;ervants of the public, Edward equipped a navy of his own &s;hips, and, di|vid$ng it into three &s;quadrons, appointed John de Boutetourt admiral, from the mouth of the Thames to the north of England; W. de Leyburne com|m$$ded from that river &s;outh to Port&s;mouth, with the fleet o$ the Cinque-Po$$s added to his &s;quadron; and the third was intru&s;ted to an Iri&s;h nobleman, who commanded in the we&s;t, and had power over all the &s;hips from Ireland and St. George's channel. The northern divi&s;ion committed depredations on th$ coa$t of Normandy, where they burned Cherburg and &s;everal other towns, and rav$ged the adjacent country.</P>
<P N="39">XXXIX. On the other hand, the king of France fitted out a &s;trong fleet, which, under the c$mmand of Matthew de Montmorency and John de Har|c$u$$, in$eited the coa&s;ts of England, and even took Dover by &s;urprize; but the militia of the country a&s;&s;embling, and pouring down upon them before they had time to fortify the place, they were obliged to retire to their &s;hips with precipitation. Philip's intention was to invade England, that he might co-operate with John Baliol, who had already engaged in a league offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive with th$t monarch, to be cemented by a marriage between Jane, daughter of Charles de Valois, and Edward, &s;on to John Baliol. In order to fac$$$tate the &s;ucce&s;s of the projected expedition, the French king had con|tracted with Eric king of Norway, for two hundred gallies, half that number of tran&s;ports, and fifty thou&s;and land forces; but this treaty was never executed. He had likewi&s;e engaged an Engli&s;h knight ta$en at Rions, to ra$&s;e an in|&s;urrection in Glamorgan&s;hire, where he had a large e&s;tate and exten&s;ive in|fluence; and this man, who&s;e name was Thomas de Turbeville, $oming over to England, pretended that he had e&s;caped from a French pri&s;on. On his ar|rival at London, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the mini&s;try, and undertook to di&s;|cover
<PB N="603" REF="6120">
the de&s;igns and weakne&s;s of the French government. He told his tale &s;o plau&s;ibly, that he was admitted to &s;everal private conferences with Edward; but, in the mid&s;t of this communication, his corre&s;pondence with the enemy was detected, and he died the death of a traitor. The king, determined to pro|vide<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. We&s;tmon.</NOTE> again&s;t this threatened inva&s;ion, &s;ummoned a parliament to meet at We&s;t|min&s;ter, and i&s;&s;ued writs for the repre&s;entation of cities and boroughs, which were never regularly repre&s;ented before this period. At this a&s;&s;embly he de|manded a &s;ub&s;idy to carry on the war again&s;t France; and a con&s;iderable &s;up|ply was granted both by the clergy and the laity. The pope had offered his mediation for a peace or truce between the two nations; and two cardinals were &s;ent over with propo&s;als for a ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities, to which, however, Edward would not agree without the concurrence of his allies on the continent: yet he &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to Cambray, where conferences were opened under the mediation of the legates; but their endeavours did not &s;ucceed. Edward equipped a fleet of three hundred and fi&s;ty &s;ail, for the tran&s;portation of &s;even thou&s;and foot and a body of hor&s;e, under the command of his brother Ed|mund, accompanied by Henry de Lacey earl of Lincoln. They &s;et &s;ail from<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1290</NOTE> Plymouth in the beginning of March, and landed at Bourg and Blaye, on the river Garonne, where, being joined by a good number of Ga&s;cons, they en|camped within a league of Bourdeaux, which was &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the enemy. In a few days after they had occupied this po&s;t, the garri&s;on made a general &s;ally, in which they lo&s;t two thou&s;and men: but, Edmund being too weak to be&s;iege the place in form, he withdrew his forces from that neighbourhood, reduced Langon, recovered St. Macaire, and marched to Bayonne, where dying of a lingering d$&s;temper, the chief command devolved to the earl of Lincoln; but nothing of con&s;equence was tran&s;acted during the remaining part of the campaign. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>By this time Edward had received intimation of the league between Philip and Baliol, which la&s;t had, by means of his ally, obtained from pope Cele&s;tine, an ab&s;olution from the oath of homage he had taken to the king of England. John, together with Robert de Brus, and the earls of Marche and Buchan, had, by repeated me&s;&s;ages, been required to &s;end &s;uccours to Edward as va&s;&s;als of his crown; but they neglected to comply with the&s;e orders, and John did not attend at the Engli&s;h parliament. The king of England, wil|ling to be more certified of Baliol's intentions, demanded the ca&s;tles of Berwick, Roxburgh, and Jedburgh, by way of &s;ecurity for his behaviour, &s;o long as the war with Fra$ce &s;hould continue; but John evaded the propo&s;al, without rejecting the d$mand. Then he and his nobility were &s;ummoned to a parlia|ment convoked at Newca&s;tle upon Tyne; and, as they neither appeared in per|&s;on, nor &s;ent an excu&s;e, Edward was fully convinced of their di&s;&s;atis$action, and re&s;olved to attack them without $urther delay. He had already appointed the rendezvous of his military tenants at this place, and i&s;&s;ued orders $or levy|ing forces in Wales and Ireland, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the Scotti&s;h expedition. While he was employed at Newca&s;tle $word$ a&s;&s;emb$$$g his forces, the guardian of the Cor|deliers at Roxb$rgh, brought a letter $$om B$liol, complaining of the r$peated injuries he had r$c$ived at th$ $word$ o$ $$ward, and $enou$cing his d$pen|dence upon the crown of England. At the &s;ame time, Robert de Ros lo$d of Werk revolted to the enemy; t$ough h$$ b$o$$er William kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="604" REF="6130">
his ca&s;tle for Edward. A thou&s;and men being detached to reinforce the garri|&s;on, were intercepted in their march by Robert, at the head of &s;ome Scotti&s;h troops, and entirely defeated. The king was no &s;ooner apprized of this action, than he advanced with his whole army, amounting to five and thirty thou&s;and men, and encamped at Werk, from whence he propo&s;ed to march into<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 12$$.</NOTE> Scotland after the Ea&s;ter holidays. Mean while an army of Scots, commanded by the earls of Buchan, Monteith, and &s;everal other noblemen, invaded England; and having made an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt upon Carli&s;le, returned to Scotland, to oppo&s;e the progre&s;s of Edward. That prince pa&s;&s;ing the Tweed at Cold|&s;tream, inve&s;ted the town of Berwick; and the fleet of the Cinque-Ports enter|ing the harbour, were &s;o warmly received by the enemy, that, after an ob&s;ti|nate engagement, they were obliged to retire with the lo&s;s of &s;everal ve&s;&s;els. The king, perceiving the &s;moke of the burning &s;hips, ordered the a&s;&s;ault to be given; and the Scots were &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed at the valour of the a&s;&s;ailants, that they made no defence, but &s;uffered them&s;elves to be &s;laughtered without oppo|&s;ition. The Scotti&s;h hi&s;torians affirm, that Edward was repul&s;ed in &s;everal at|tacks, and at length had recour&s;e to &s;tratagem: that he withdrew his army as if he had meant to rai&s;e the &s;iege; and provided banners and en&s;igns like tho&s;e that were di&s;played by the Scotti&s;h kings and nobility; that he ordered his &s;ol|diers to wear S$$ Andrew's cro&s;&s;es above their armour, a mark by which the Sects di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in battle; then returning &s;uddenly, tho&s;e who belonged to the faction of Bruce advanced before the re&s;t, and told their coun|trymen, that king John was come with an army to their relief. The people and garri&s;on crediting this information, ran out in crouds to meet their &s;overeign; when a detachment of hor&s;e cutting off their retreat, and &s;eizing one of the gates, they were cut in pieces before they could put them&s;elves in a po&s;ture of defence. The Engli&s;h army immediately entered the town without oppo&s;ition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> and ma&s;&s;acred above &s;even thou&s;and men, women, and children. The Engli&s;h writers agree in the account of this carnage, which was made under the eye of Edward him&s;elf, not much to the credit of his humanity.</P>

<P>While he &s;tayed in this place to put it in a po&s;ture of defence, the Scotti&s;h army entered Rede&s;dale, and ravaged Northumberland as far as Hex|ham, burning churches and convents, and committing other acts of barbarity; but they &s;oon retreated to their own country, upon hearing that the king of England was upon his march to give them battle. The reduction of Berwick laid all the lowlands of Scotland open to the incur&s;ions of the Engli&s;h; for, be|tween this place and Edinburgh there was no other fortre&s;s but that of Dun|bar, belonging to the earl of Marche, who was in the &s;ervice of Edward. This nobleman was an adherent of Robert de Brus, &s;on of Baliol's competitor, who died in the cour&s;e of the preceding year. Edward, knowing the animo|&s;ity that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the&s;e two families, had, by this time, engaged Bruce in his intere&s;t, by an offer of the crown which he intended to wre&s;t from Baliol; and the influence of this nobleman, attached the mo&s;t powerful barons of Scotland to his &s;ervice. The nobility that adhered to John Baliol, knowing the importance of Dunbar, prevailed upon the wife of Patrick earl of Marche to deliver up the fortre&s;s into their hands, and &s;upplied it with a &s;trong garri|&s;on to retard the progre&s;s of the Engli&s;h. Edward, being informed of this tran&s;action, detached the earl of Warenne with a &s;trong body of forces to
<PB N="605" REF="6140">
be&s;iege the ca&s;tle, which was gallantly defended for &s;ome time, until the be&s;ieged, finding them&s;elves unable to with&s;tand the vigour of the a&s;&s;ailants, demanded a ce&s;&s;ation of three days, within which they might make their king acquainted with the nature of their &s;ituation; and they obliged them&s;elves to &s;urrender the fort, provided he &s;hould fail to march to their relief. Baliol, having a&s;&s;embled a numerous army, re&s;olved to hazard an engagement rather than give up a ca&s;tle of &s;uch con&s;equence; and, on the third day of the truce, he appeared in &s;ight of Dunbar, at the head of forty thou&s;and men. Warenne immediately advanced, and attacked them with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that the Scots were routed with great &s;laughter, and fled beyond the Forth, leaving all the &s;outhern parts to the mercy of the Engli&s;h. Dunbar immediately &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion; and the ca&s;tles of Jedburgh and Roxburgh followed the example of this garri&s;on.</P>

<P>Edward detached Robert de Brus, and his &s;on of the &s;ame name, to receive the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the barons of Annandale and Carrick; while he him&s;elf, advancing at the head of his army, reinforced by five and forty thou|&s;and men from Wales and Ireland, reduced the ca&s;tles of Edinburgh and Stir|ling, and then marched to Perth, where he gave audience to the agents of John Baliol, who implored his mercy in the mo&s;t abject terms of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Anthony Beck bi&s;hop of Durham was directed to treat with him at Kincar|din; and as he a&s;&s;ented to every thing that was propo&s;ed, his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion was performed in the church-yard of a place called Strickathroe, where he appeared meanly mounted upon a &s;orry hor&s;e, with a white rod in his hand, before Ed|ward, who received him with ineffable contempt. Then he profe&s;&s;ed his &s;or|row and penitence, for having engaged in a league with the king of France again&s;t his liege lord, whom he now be&s;ought to forgive him for his folly; and renounced his French alliance, in the name of him&s;elf, his &s;on Edward, and all the &s;ubjects of Scotland. An in&s;trument, containing the terms and manner of this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, was &s;ealed and authenticated by the nobility then pre&s;ent; and, as if this humiliation had not been &s;ufficient, Baliol repeated it in the ca&s;tle of Brechin, where he re&s;igned his per&s;on, crown, dignity, and private e&s;tates, into the hands of the conqueror, who &s;ent him under a guard to England. The great &s;eal of Scotland was now broken, as being of no further u&s;e; though another, with the Engli&s;h arms, was made and delivered to Walter de Agmon|de&s;ham. The king appointed Hugh de Cre&s;&s;ingham trea&s;urer, W. de Or|me&s;by ju&s;ticiary, Henry Piercy warden of Galloway, and John de Warenne, earl of Surrey, guardian of the kingdom. Edward having proceeded as far north as Murray, and finding the country quiet and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, returned by the way of Scone, from whence he carried off the famous &s;tone chair on which the kings of Scotland u&s;ed to be placed at their coronation; and this precaution, trivial as it may &s;eem to be, contributed in a great mea&s;ure to tame the people to the Engli&s;h yoke; for the chair was implicitly and univer&s;ally believed to be the palladium of their monarchy. At the &s;ame time he ordered all the records of the kingdom to be taken away or de&s;troyed, that the Scots might have no monuments of their former independency. Having thus fini&s;hed the conque&s;t of that kingdom, he marched back to Berwick, where he convened the pre|lates, nobility, freeholders, with the deputies of the royal boroughs and other communities of the realm, who renounced the alliance with France, did ho|mage
<PB N="606" REF="6150">
for their lands, &s;wore fealty to the king of England as their lord para|mount, and &s;ub&s;cribed an authentic deed, &s;pecifying all the&s;e articles of their &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion. Edward having &s;ubdued Scotland, and &s;ecured the tranquility of that country by prudent regulations, di&s;banded his forces, and returned to the &s;outhern parts of his dominions, accompanied by John Cumin of Badenogh, and &s;ome other S$otti&s;h noblemen, whom he thought proper to detain as pri&s;on|ers of war until his di&s;pute with France &s;hould be decided.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XLIII.</HEAD>
<P>As this expedition had been very expen&s;ive, and Edward had remit|ted great &s;ums to &s;upport the war in Ga&s;cony, he a&s;&s;embled a parliament at St. Edmund&s;bury, where he received a con&s;iderable &s;upply from the laity; but met with an ab&s;olute refu&s;al from the clergy, who pleaded a late bull of pope Boniface, $orbidding them to grant &s;ub&s;idies to princes without the pope's l$cen&s;e, and prohibiting all &s;overeigns from levying &s;uch &s;upplies, on pain o$ incurring the &s;entence of excommunication. This bull had been ob|tained by the intere&s;t of Robert de Winchel&s;ey archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, with the concurrence of the Engli&s;h clergy, that they might be protected from all taxation. Edward, equally inoen&s;ed and a&s;toni&s;hed at their refu&s;al, adjourned their meeting till January, that they might have time to deliberate upon his demand, and form their final re&s;olution on the &s;ubject. Mean while the king's daughter Elizabeth was married to John the young count of Hol|land, Zealand, and Frie&s;land; and the nuptials were &s;olemnized at Ip&s;wich. Guy count of Flanders having been relea&s;ed from his confinement in France, renewed his treaty with Edward, who agreed to &s;upply him with a con&s;iderable &s;ub&s;idy, that he might be enabled to levy a &s;trong body of forces, with which he intended to invade the dominions of Philip. It was likewi&s;e &s;tipulated that prince Edward &s;hould e&s;pou&s;e the count's daughter Philippa. The other con|federates, whom he had formerly engaged, continued &s;till &s;taunch to his in|tere&s;t; but as they could not be retained without repeated &s;ub&s;idies, he ex|pected with impatience the next meeting of the clergy, in hope of finding them well di&s;po&s;ed to relieve his nece&s;&s;ities. But, in&s;tead of receiving a favourable an&s;wer at their convocation, the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury told the king's com|mi&s;&s;ioners, in the name of his brethren, that they had two &s;uperiors, namely the pope and the king; and though they were bound to obey both, yet they owed the greater obedience to his holine&s;s, as their &s;piritual lord and ma&s;ter. Edward was not a prince to be treated in this manner with impunity: he re|&s;olved to be king in his own dominions without any competition; and he looked upon the power of the pope as an impudent u&s;urpation, which none but weak princes would endure. He thought tho&s;e who di&s;claimed or endeavoured to depre$s the royal authority, did not de&s;erve its protection; and that none &s;hould enjoy the benefit of the laws, except tho&s;e who contributed to relieve the ne|ce&s;&s;ities of the government. In the&s;e &s;entiments he &s;ent orders to all the &s;ea|ports, to prevent any per&s;on's leaving the kingdom without his &s;pecial licen&s;e; then he withdrew his protectior from the cle$gy, by a declaration publi&s;hed in all his courts, and &s;eized all their lay $ees, goo$s and chattels: but this &s;eve|rity extended no farth$r than the province of Ca$terbury, becau&s;e the clergy of York had alre d$ complied with the king's demands, and obtained a par|ticular w$$$ of protection. The recu&s;a$ts were now reduced to a deplorable condition: their effects were &s;eized, and their revenues &s;eque&s;tred; they were
<PB N="607" REF="6160">

Winchel&s;ey derived fre&s;h ob&s;tinacy from pro&s;ecution: he ordered the pope's bull to be publi&s;hed in all the churches of his province, and convened a &s;ynod of his &s;u$fragans at St. Paul's in London; but Edward i&s;&s;ued a writ, inhibiting them from enacting any con&s;titution to the prejudice of the king, his mini&s;ters, or faithful &s;ubjects: they were, in a particular manner, forbid to publi&s;h the &s;entence of excommunication again&s;t any per&s;on on pain of im|pri&s;onment; and Ither de Engoule&s;me archdeacon of Bath appealed, in the king's name, to the pope again&s;t their proceedings; an expedient which ef|fectually &s;u&s;pended their operations. Finding them&s;elves cut off from all re|medy but that which they might expect from Rome, and &s;eeing all their goods confi&s;cated in a &s;olemn manner by a parliament or convention of the nobility, they were obliged to &s;ue for protections, which they did not obtain without<NOTE PLACE="marg">M.

<P>Even the&s;e compo&s;itions were not &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;es of the king, who was pre$&s;ed by his allies to cro&s;s the &s;ea; but, as he could not put his army and auxil$aries in motion without con&s;iderable &s;upplies in money, and &s;aw no other way of rai&s;ing it in his dominions, he &s;eized and &s;old for his own u&s;e, great quantities of wool and leather, bought up by the merchants for ex|portation; and exacted two thou&s;and quarters of corn, be&s;ides other provi&s;ions, from every county in the kingdom, for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of his troops in Ga&s;|cony. Though he promi&s;ed to reimbur&s;e the proprietors of the wool when he &s;hould find it convenient, the&s;e arbitrary mea&s;ures excited an univer&s;al di&s;&s;atis|faction over the whole country. Under Edward they produced complaints; but in the reign of a le&s;s re&s;olute prince, they would have been attended with rebellion: not that his barons were totally degenerated from the &s;pirit of their fathers; he had occa&s;ion to perceive their fortitude and re&s;olution at this very period. In order to execute his projects on the continent, he a&s;&s;embled a par|liament at Sali&s;bury, to regulate the proportion of troops which every baron &s;hould furni&s;h for the expedition. His aim was to make a powerful diver&s;ion in Guienne by his &s;ubjects, while he him&s;elf &s;hould pre&s;s the enemy on the &s;ide of Flanders: but he found his noblemen unwilling to &s;erve in any place where he did not command in per&s;on. Each individual excu&s;ed him&s;elf from going abroad, though he did not refu&s;e to contribute his proportion of men for the &s;ervice. Edward, p$qued at their excu&s;es, threatened to give their lands to others who &s;hould be more obedient. The&s;e menaces gave great umbrage to the nobility: Humphrey Bohun, earl of Hereford, great con&s;table of the realm; and Hugh Bigod, earl of Norfolk, great mare&s;chal, told him plainly they were ready to accompany his maje&s;ty, but would not &s;erve except where he him&s;elf &s;hould be pre&s;ent. Edward, incen&s;ed at this declaration, exclaimed in a tran&s;port of anger, <Q>&startq;By the eternal God! you &s;hall either go or be hanged.&endq;</Q> The earl of Norfolk replied in the &s;ame &s;train, <Q>&startq;By the eternal God! I will neither go nor be hanged;&endq;</Q> and he and Hereford retired that &s;ame day from parliament, attended by a numerous body of armed men, who &s;eemed to &s;et his maje&s;ty at defiance. When they arrived in their own terri|tories, they would not &s;uffer the king's officers to collect the duties on wool or

leather, or take any thing by way of purveyance: they even expelled tho&s;e<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> collectors from their lands, and prepared for an open in&s;urrection.</P>

<P>Edward had &s;een &s;uch in&s;tances of union and per&s;everence among the barons in his father's reign, that he did not chu&s;e to ri&s;k his glory and repo&s;e upon the i&s;&s;ue of a war with his own &s;ubjects: be&s;ides, &s;uch a di&s;pute at this juncture would have di&s;abled him from pro&s;ecuting his revenge again&s;t Phi|lip king of France, or complying with the earne&s;t reque&s;t of his ally the count of Flanders, who pre&s;&s;ed him to cro&s;s the &s;ea with all po&s;&s;ible expedition; he therefore di&s;&s;embled his re&s;entment again&s;t the con&s;table and mare&s;chal, though he &s;oon found an opportunity to deprive them of their offices. The king &s;um|moned his nobility, and all who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed twenty pounds a year in land, to rendezvous on the fir&s;t day of July at London, with hor&s;e and arms, in order to accompany him to Flanders. Among&s;t others the earls of Hereford and Nor|folk were required to appear by particular mandates. The con&s;table came in per&s;on; but the earl of Norfolk excu&s;ed him&s;elf on account of &s;ickne&s;s, and &s;ent John de Seagrave as his proxy. It was re&s;olved in council, that a procla|mation &s;hould be i&s;&s;ued for mu&s;tering the forces next day at St. Paul's: though this was properly the bu&s;ine&s;s of the con&s;table and the mare&s;chal, they refu&s;ed to do their office; and the king be&s;towed their employments upon Tho|mas de Berkley and Geoffrey de Geyneville. The earls publi&s;hed a manife&s;to, ju&s;tifying their conduct, and repre&s;enting the grievances of the nation in the burden of taxes, the poverty of the &s;ubject, the intrenchment on franchi&s;es, and the neglect of Magna Charta, as well as of the a&s;&s;ize of the fore&s;t. Edward took the pains to an&s;wer this memorial; and, con&s;cious of the influence of the clergy, reconciled him&s;elf to the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, in an a&s;&s;embly of the nobility and people at We&s;tmin&s;ter. He excu&s;ed the taxes laid upon them for the maintenance of wars, in which he had been unavoidably engaged for the advantage of his country, and the recovery of his own inheritance: he a&s;|&s;ured them, on the word of a king, that he would redre&s;s all their grievances on his return from abroad; but in ca&s;e he &s;hould die in that expedition, he conjured them to pre&s;erve their fidelity to his &s;on Edward, whom he left under the care of archbi&s;hop Winchel&s;ey and Reginal de Grey, whom he appointed regents of the realm in his ab&s;ence. This metropolitan, and &s;ome of his &s;uffra|gans, having undertaken to compromi&s;e the difference between his maje&s;ty and the $$$contented earls, propo&s;ed a conference at Waltham, $o which place the con&s;table and mare&s;chal &s;ent their deputies, alledging that they did not think it &s;afe to appear in per&s;on. Safe-conducts were granted, but they &s;till declined the interview. Edward found means to revenge him&s;elf partly on Hereford, by relea&s;ing Ralf de Monthermer, who had married Jane counte&s;s of Glou|ce&s;ter without the knowlege of the king her father. He had been impri&s;oned at Bri&s;tol for that offence, but now was &s;et at liberty, and inve&s;ted with the honour of Glouce&s;ter, that he might watch the motions of Hereford, and fall upon him at once, if ever he &s;hould pre&s;ume to excite commotions on the Wel&s;h March$s.</P>

<P>The&s;e precautions being taken, he embarked at Winchel&s;ey for Flanders: and that very day the earls of Hereford and Norfolk appeared at the bar of the exch$q$$r, accompanied by a great number of knights and ban|$erets; where alter having complained of the &s;ub&s;idies lately granted, and the
<PB N="609" REF="6180">
duty and price of wool, as intolerable grievances, forbade the barons to levy the eighth granted by the boroughs without the king's knowledge, and de|manded redre&s;s of the other hard&s;hips under which the nation laboured. This eighth had been granted by the cities, boroughs, and towns, of the royal deme&s;ne, without the concurrence of the earls, barons, knights, and commu|nity, of the kingdom; and therefore the earls objected to it as a practice tend|ing to the di&s;heri&s;on of them and their heirs. The king being made acquainted with this remon&s;trance, declared, by proclamation, that the taxation of the eighth &s;hould not be drawn into a precedent; that though nece&s;&s;ity had obliged him to &s;eize upon the wool, for the common &s;afety of the realm, he would refund the value to the proprietors; and he a&s;&s;ured his people that &s;uch methods of rai&s;ing money &s;hould not be practi&s;ed for the future. Had the &s;ums<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wal&s;ingham. Rymer.</NOTE> &s;o rai&s;ed been employed for the defence or advantage of England, he might have been excu&s;ed for &s;uch an act of de&s;poti&s;m; but as they were immediately applied for the purpo&s;es of a foreign war, with which the intere&s;ts of England ought to have had no connection, the king could not expect that his &s;ubjects would pay much regard to his declaration. The Engli&s;h had been harra&s;&s;ed, without intermi&s;&s;ion, &s;ince the beginning of his reign, in executing the pro|jects of his ambition, from which they reaped nothing but di&s;a&s;ter. The war with France was a gulph that &s;wallowed up the lives and &s;ub&s;tance of the nation. He had, indeed, acquired glory in his conque&s;t of Wales and Scotland; yet this was but an un&s;ub&s;tantial recompence for the blood and trea&s;ure he had lo&s;t in tho&s;e two expeditions: nor was the reduction of tho&s;e countries &s;o com|plete, but that he had rea&s;on to expect continual revolts, in&s;urrections, and incur&s;ions, which would expo&s;e the conquerors to perpetual alarms, danger, and expence. The Scots had already begun to make efforts for the recovery of their freedom. Earl Warenne, guardian of that kingdom, di&s;liking the climate, had retired to the north of England; and a few Scots, who had fled to the mountains from the arms and &s;overeignty of Edward, took this oppor|tunity to retrieve their independence. They were headed by William Wallace, the younger &s;on of a gentleman who lived in the we&s;tern part of the kingdom. He was a per&s;on of gigantic &s;tature, incredible &s;trength, and amazing intre|pidity: his character was unblemi&s;hed; his heart glowed with the &s;entiments of liberty; and all the virtues of heroi&s;m were united in his character. Such is the portrait of Wallace, drawn by the hi&s;torians of his own country; where|as the Engli&s;h writers repre&s;ent him as a robber and an outlaw. Nor is there any difficulty in reconciling the&s;e accounts. Wallace thought he had a right to commit depredations upon the enemies of his country; and the Engli&s;h very naturally con&s;idered him as a rebel and a robber, who di&s;turbed the e&s;tabli&s;hed government, and attacked their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions without immediate pro|vocation. He was without que&s;tion outlawed by the admini&s;tration; and per|haps the greater part of tho&s;e who at fir&s;t attached them&s;elves to his fortune, were people who had incurred the cen&s;ures of the law, and fled from the exe|cution of ju&s;tice. His fir&s;t exploits were confined to petty ravages, and occa|&s;ional attacks upon the Engli&s;h officers and detached parties, in which he ac|quired &s;uch reputation, that in a little time his band was con&s;iderably aug|mented by tho&s;e who, like him&s;elf, were fired with the love of independence; as well as a good number of per&s;ons provoked by the in&s;ults and oppre&s;&s;ion they had &s;u&s;tained from Orme&s;by, the ju&s;ticiary, who was a man of an arbi|trary
<PB N="610" REF="6190">
and imperious di&s;po&s;ition. Wallace thus reinforced, formed a plan for &s;urpri&s;ing this mini&s;ter at Scone, where he u&s;ually re&s;ided; and though his per&s;on e&s;caped with great difficulty, all his effects, together with the adjoining country, were left as a prey to the enemy, who being about this time joined by Sir William Douglas, began to grow important and formidable. The bi&s;hop of Carlile, and &s;ome lords of the Marches, alarmed at this commotion, &s;um|moned Robert de Brus the younger, to come to that city and renew his oath to Edward; and he not only complied with the citation, but even wa&s;ted the lands of Douglas, in return to his own country of Carrick.</P>

<P>The king of England being informed of this in&s;urrection, or|dered the earl of Warenne to rai&s;e the military force of the northern counties, and attack the Scots, who had by this time cro&s;&s;ed the border, and begun to ravage the country. Warenne being old and infirm, &s;ent his grand&s;on Henry de Percy, and Robert de Clifford, with an army of forty thou&s;and men, into Anandale, where they &s;urpri&s;ed the Scotti&s;h forces, who being inferior in number, capitulated, and promi&s;ed to give ho&s;tages for their future fidelity. Richard de Lundy, upon this occa&s;ion, went over with his followers to the Engli&s;h army; and Robert de Brus, who had, notwith&s;tanding his late oath at Car$$le, joined his countrymen with James Steward of Scotland, was among the number of tho&s;e who &s;ubmitted. Mean while the earl of Warenne, with another army, advanced into Scotland again&s;t William Wallace, who lay with his forces advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted in the neighbourhood of Stirling, on the other &s;ide of the river Forth. Hugh Cre&s;&s;ingham, the trea&s;urer, a man of a proud, in&s;olent, over-bearing temper, pre&s;&s;ed the earl to pa&s;s the river and attack the enemy; and though Richard de Lundy offered to ford it with a detachment of hor&s;e and foot, and keep the Scots in play, until the re&s;t of his army &s;hould have cro&s;&s;ed by a narrow bridge which was in their front, his propo&s;al was rejected; and the earl Warenne, in&s;tigated by the &s;arca&s;ms of the trea&s;urer, ordered his troops to march along that wooden convenience. When Wallace perceived about half the army pa&s;&s;ed, he quitted his po&s;t, and attacked them with &s;uch fury that they were routed and cut in pieces. Hugh de Cre&s;&s;ingham, and above five thou&s;and Engli&s;h, were killed upon the &s;pot, be&s;ides tho&s;e who peri&s;hed in the river; and Warenne retired with the remains of his army to Berwick. Thither he was followed by Wallace, and his col|league Andrew Murray, at who&s;e approach he abandoned the place, which they entered in triumph; though they could not reduce the ca&s;tle. From thence they marched to Carlile, which they in vain attempted to reduce; and then ravaged the counties of Northumberland and Cumberland for a whole month, without oppo&s;ition. This was a very glorious campaign for Wallace, whom his followers had declared regent or guardian of the kingdom. He had, in the cour&s;e of a few months, reduced almo&s;t all the ca&s;tles and fortre&s;&s;es which the Engli&s;h held in Scotland; defeated their general, and invaded their country; from whence he returned laden with an immen&s;e booty, which di&s;pelled the pro&s;pect of famine that threatened the people of Scotland, from the neglect of agriculture.</P>

Hereford and Norfolk cho&s;e to engage in this &s;ervice. The archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and other prelates, con&s;idering the danger to which the country was expo&s;ed from inte&s;tine divi&s;ions, at &s;uch a critical juncture, exhorted prince Edward to compromi&s;e the difference with Hereford and Norfolk: writs were i&s;&s;ued for &s;ummoning the&s;e two noblemen particularly, together with eight lords of their party, and a number of prelates, to con&s;ider with the prince upon the pre&s;ent emergency of affairs; and afterwards a parliament was convened for confirming the two charters, agreeable to the king's promi&s;e in a late declaration. The earls accordingly appeared at London, attended by five hundred hor&s;e, and a great number of armed infantry, and not only in&s;i&s;ted upon a confirmation of the two charters, as fundamental con&s;titutions, but al&s;o procured a &s;tatute, enacting that no talliage nor aid &s;hould be levied in the kingdom without the con&s;ent of parliament; that no merchandi&s;e &s;hould be &s;eized for the future on any pretence what&s;oever; that the new tax or toll upon wool &s;hould be remitted; and that a general pardon &s;hould be granted to the earls of Hereford and Norfolk, John de Ferrers, and all their adherents.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hemingford.</NOTE> In con&s;ideration of the&s;e indulgences, the nobility and clergy granted &s;ub&s;idies for the defence of the kingdom; and the earls agreed to march into Scotland, or cro&s;s the &s;ea, to &s;erve according to his maje&s;ty's direction. Edward con|firmed and ratified the&s;e tran&s;actions, and &s;ent orders to the earls and nobility in England, to meet in arms at York, on the twentieth day of January, that they might be ready to march into Scotland.

<P>Edward's expedition to the continent had been very un&s;ucce&s;sful. Philip had engaged the king of Ca&s;tile and Arragon in his intere&s;t. The count de Bar, one of the allies of England, who invaded Champagne, was obliged to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion to Jane, queen of France and Navarre. Adolphus of Na&s;&s;au, and the duke of Au&s;tria, were debauched from Edward's intere&s;t, by the addre&s;s and liberality of Philip; and their example was followed by the dukes of Brabant and Luxemburg, and the counts of Guelderland and Beaumont. Then the French king entering Flanders, at the head of &s;ixty thou&s;and men, inve&s;ted Li&s;le; while Guy, unable to face him in the field, and depending entirely on the &s;uccours from England, employed the duke de Ju|liers to make a diver&s;ion in his favour. Again&s;t this general Philip detached the count D'Artois, who coming up with him in the neighbourhood of Furnes, a battle en&s;ued, in which the duke of Juliers was defeated and &s;lain. Guy was &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by this defeat, that he dur&s;t not &s;tir from Ghent, where he waited for Edward with great impatience and perplexity, ari&s;ing not only from the &s;trength of his enemy, but al&s;o from the factions that divided his country, one half of which was in the French intere&s;t. At length the king of England arrived with a body of troops, not at all equal to the importance of the enterprize, and found the city of Bruges in &s;uch confu&s;ion, occa&s;ioned by the different parties, that it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty he could appea&s;e their animo&s;ity, by granting them &s;ome particular immunities in their trade with his &s;ubjects. The &s;ame divi&s;ions reigned in Ghent, which, while Edward
<PB N="612" REF="6210">
endeavoured to compromi&s;e, the king of France made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Lille, Douav$ Courtray, and &s;everal other towns in the neighbourhood. Then he marched to Bruges, which &s;urrendered without re&s;i&s;tance; and he formed a plan for burning the Engli&s;h fleet which lay at anchor at Damme: but his de&s;ign taking air, they put to &s;ea and avoided de&s;truction. All the mea&s;ures of Edward were broken by the perfidy of his allies. He had very little a&s;|&s;i&s;tance to expect from the count of Flanders, the majority of who&s;e &s;ubjects was in the intere&s;t of France: his own troops were too weak to oppo&s;e the progre&s;s of the enemy; and the new troubles in Scotland rendered his pre|fence nece&s;&s;ary in his own dominions. In this emergency, he had recour&s;e to the good offices of the king of Sicily and the count of Savoy, who offered their mediation between him and Philip. Conferences were opened, and a truce concluded at Fi&s;mes in October, to be in force only for two months: but it was afterwards prolonged for two years, that the pope might have time to adju&s;t the articles of a &s;olid peace, which they agreed to accept upon the terms he &s;hould propo&s;e. This was accordingly effected in the month of June, when Beniface annulled the contract of marriage between prince Edward and I&s;abel, daughter of the count of Flanders; and decreed a double march between king Edward and Margaret of France, &s;i&s;ter to Philip the Fair, and between young Edward and Philip's daughter I&s;abel. The damages done before the com|mencement of the war were ordered to be repaired on both &s;ides: and all the places po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the contending parties, in each other's territories, were &s;e|que&s;trated into the hands of the pope, until all differences &s;hould be finally adju&s;ted between them and their re&s;pective allies, who were comprehended by<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> name in the truce and treaty.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch 1298.</NOTE> While this treaty was on the anvil, the Engli&s;h nobility met in par|liament at York; but as the Scots, who were &s;ummoned to that a&s;&s;embly, did not attend, a rendezvous was appointed at Newca&s;tle for the forces de&s;tined to $nvade Scotland. There they mu&s;tered two thou&s;and men at arms, twelve hundred light hor&s;e, and an infinite number of infantry, with which they ad|vanced to the relief of Roxburgh and Berwick, which were be&s;ieged by the Scots, who retired at their approach. It was now the middle of winter, &s;o that they proceeded no farther than Berwick, where they di&s;banded all their army but fifteen hundred cho&s;en men, and about twenty thou&s;and infantry, and re&s;olved to wait the king's arrival. Edward landed in March at Sand|wich, from whence repairing to London, he re&s;tored the franchi&s;es of that city. Then he i&s;&s;ued commi&s;&s;ions for enquiring into the grievances of his people; and gave orders for convoking a parliament at Carlile, to which the Scotti&s;h nobility were &s;ummoned, on pain of being declared traitors, and ene|mies to the public. If we may believe the hi&s;torians of that country, Edward a&s;&s;embled a multitude of raw troops at his fir&s;t arrival, and marched directly again&s;t Wallace, who had advanced as far as York&s;hire: that coming in &s;ight of the Scotti&s;h army, and &s;eeing the excellent order and good countenance with which they waited his attack, he thought proper to retire, without hazard|ing a battle, until he &s;hould have a&s;&s;embled an army on which he could have more dependence. The &s;ame writers likewi&s;e affirm, that the king &s;ent a threatening letter to Wallace, in which he told him that he dur&s;t not have re|volted in Scotland, much le&s;s invaded England, if he him&s;elf had not been ab&s;ent from his Briti&s;h dominions; and that the Scotti&s;h guardian replied, it was not

<P>The Scotti&s;h nobility refu&s;ing to attend the parliament at Carlile, Edward appointed the rendezvous of his army at Roxburgh; and in the mean time the earls of Hereford and Norfolk, &s;till diffident of his &s;incerity, in&s;i&s;ted upon his ratifying anew the charters of their liberties; nor would they proceed until the bi&s;hop of Durham, with the earls of Surrey, Warwick, and Glou|ce&s;ter, &s;wore in the king's name that they &s;hould have the &s;atisfaction they de|manded, at his return from this expedition. He was now fully determined to de&s;troy the Scotti&s;h name and nation. He had a&s;&s;embled an army of ninety thou&s;and men, and ordered his fleet to attend him in his march, to &s;upply him with provi&s;ions, which he could not expect to find in &s;uch a barren country. He invaded Scotland by the we&s;t border, and had like to have &s;uffered by the detention of his &s;hips, which were prevented by contrary winds from coming up; &s;o that he had marched three days into the country, and then advanced on the other &s;ide of the kingdom, with a view to be &s;upplied by a &s;econd &s;quadron, which he had directed to enter the frith of Forth, in ca&s;e he &s;hould find it nece&s;&s;ary to change his route. Wallace is &s;aid to have harra&s;&s;ed him in his march with a body of light troops; and to have obtained &s;everal advantages over detachments from the Engli&s;h army, which was by this time reinforced by the Gallovidians, and Robert de Brus, who envied the guardian's reputation, and &s;eemed to think that he a&s;pired at the crown. Al|mo&s;t all the noblemen of that country con&s;idered Wallace as an ambitious up|&s;tart, who had acquired a popularity dangerous and di&s;graceful to their intere&s;t and reputation. They looked upon his conduct as a reproach upon their pu&s;il|lanimity; and all the men of intere&s;t and family were either his &s;ecret or pro|fe&s;&s;ed enemies. In conjunction with James Stuart, and John Cumin, he had a&s;&s;embled thirty thou&s;and men, and encamped near Falkirk, by the wall of Antoninus. Thither Edward pur&s;ued his march, in order to bring them to a deci&s;ive engagement: and he found them already drawn up in three &s;eparate divi&s;ions, each forming a complete phalanx of pikemen, and the intervals lined with archers: their hor&s;e were placed in the rear, and their front was &s;ecured with pali&s;adoes. Edward having ob&s;erved the po&s;ture of the enemy, ordered the charge to be &s;ounded. And this was an&s;wered by the Scots with &s;uch a hideous yell, that the king's hor&s;e being frightened threw his rider, and afterwards kicked him on the ribs as he lay on the ground: notwith&s;tanding this accident, he mounted again with his u&s;ual alacrity, and ordered the Wel&s;h troops to begin the attack. The&s;e declining the &s;ervice, he advanced in per|&s;on, at the head of another battalion, and the pali&s;adoes being pulled up, charged the enemy with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity as they could not re&s;i&s;t. Wallace &s;eeing him advance, encouraged his men with a &s;hort &s;peech, and re&s;olved to &s;u&s;tain the attack on foot. He accordingly behaved with his u&s;ual courage, and his troops for &s;ome time followed his example: but, in the heat of the battle, the divi&s;ion commanded by Cumin quitted the field, in con&s;equence of their leader's treachery, or a previous quarrel with the guardian about the po&s;t of honour; and his retreat leaving Stuart's command expo&s;ed, they were &s;urrounded, and cut in pieces to a man. Wallace &s;till maintained the battle, till his pikemen, being galled by the Engli&s;h arrows, began to give way,

and he found him&s;elf in danger of being &s;urrounded: then he was obliged to relinqui&s;h the field; and, by the favour of the night, accompli&s;hed a retreat, with the remains of his army; leaving a complete victory to Edward, and about twelve thou&s;and of his countrymen dead on the &s;pot; whereas the lo&s;s of the Engli&s;h did not amount to one hundred men.</P>

<P>The king, immediately after this advantage, advanced to Perth and St. Andrews, ravaging the country without oppo&s;ition. Then turning back, he marched through the fore&s;t of Selkirk to Anandale, where he reduced the ca&s;tle of Lochmaban; and from thence continued his route to Carlile, where<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hemingford.</NOTE> he &s;ummoned a parliament to regulate the affairs of Scotland. He had already granted the i&s;le of Arran to Thomas Bi&s;et, who had come over with a body of troops from Ireland to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance: and at this a&s;&s;embly he gave away, among his followers, the e&s;tates belonging to tho&s;e Scotti&s;h noble|men who continued in rebellion: but, before the meeting of the parliament, the earls of Hereford and Norfolk, di&s;&s;atisfied with &s;ome circum&s;tances of Ed|ward's behaviour, a&s;ked leave, on pretence of fatigue, to return to their re|&s;pective e&s;tates; and the con&s;table died on the la&s;t day of the year. When the &s;e&s;&s;ion broke up at Carlile, the king repaired to Durham, and hearing the Scots were beginning to re-a&s;&s;emble their &s;hattered forces, he pa&s;&s;ed the Chri&s;t|mas holidays at Tinmouth. Then he proceeded for London, where he held a parliament, in which the pope's award was read and unanimou&s;ly approved.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1299.</NOTE> The two charters were confirmed, together with &s;ome other articles relating to the disfore&s;ting of certain lands; which he pa&s;&s;ed, however, with a &s;alvo to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. We&s;t.</NOTE> rights of his crown. At this period two friars arrived from France; and de|manded, in Philip's name, the relea&s;e of John Baliol, who, &s;ince his re&s;igna|tion, had been kept pri&s;oner in the Tower of London. The French king comprehended him in the number of his allies, and demanded his enlargement by virtue of the late treaty, in which it was &s;tipulated that the allies of each prince &s;hould have the benefit of the pacification. Edward alledged that Baliol was his va&s;&s;al, who had formally renounced his engagement with France, con|&s;equently could not be con&s;idered as one of Philip's allies. The French agents replied, that the counts of Flanders and Bar, though va&s;&s;als of the crown of France, had been &s;pecified in the treaties; and that the renunciation of Baliol was the effect of compul&s;ion. While this affair was &s;pun out into a negotiation, that contemptible prince was influenced to declare, in pre&s;ence of the bi&s;hop of Durham, con&s;table of the Tower, and a public notary, that he had found &s;o much malice, fraud, treachery, and deceit, in the Scots, while he &s;at upon their throne, that for the future he would never have the lea&s;t concern with<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> that kingdom or people. Neverthele&s;s, the di&s;pute was left to the deci&s;ion of the pope, and John was put into the hands of Boniface's nuncio, at Wit&s;and, near Calais, on the expre&s;s conditions that his holine&s;s was at liberty to decide as he &s;hould think proper, touching the per&s;on and Engli&s;h e&s;tate of the pri|&s;oner; but that he &s;hould not intermeddle in the affairs of Scotland, which Edward wholly re&s;erved for his own cognizance.</P>

<P>The Scots began to breathe after their late di&s;a&s;ter. Wallace per|ceiving how much he was envied by the nobility, and knowing how prejudicial that envy would prove to the intere&s;t of his country, had re&s;igned the regency of the kingdom, and humbled him&s;elf into a private &s;tation; in which, how|ever, he continued to take all opportunities of annoying the Engli&s;h, at the
<PB N="615" REF="6240">
head of a &s;mall body of friends, who would not for&s;ake him in adver&s;ity. The re&s;t of the Scots, who wi&s;hed to deliver them&s;elves from the yoke of Ed|ward, pitched upon Cumin to &s;upply his room; and that nobleman endea|voured to approve him&s;elf worthy of this preheminence. Under&s;tanding that a treaty was on the carpet between France and England at Montreuil, under the arbitration of the pope, he &s;ent deputies to Philip, de&s;iring that the Scots might be comprehended in the pacification. The conjuncture was favourable for them, becau&s;e Edward was impatient to recover Guienne: but all that the French king could obtain was a truce for &s;even months, in favour of the Scotti&s;h malecontents. This was &s;o ill ob&s;erved by the Engli&s;h; and the people of that country were oppre&s;&s;ed and in&s;ulted in &s;uch a manner, that they were animated by de&s;pair, and &s;eemed ready to peri&s;h in an attempt to recover their freedom. This &s;pirit was carefully cheri&s;hed by Cumin, who repre&s;ented to the barons of his party, that unle&s;s they &s;hould take &s;ome immediate mea&s;ures for their own pre&s;ervation, the king of England would reduce them to the mo&s;t wretched &s;tate of &s;lavery; and that they &s;till had it in their power to &s;hake off his yoke, by one generous effort during the winter, when their country was in a manner inacce&s;&s;ible to the forces of England. His remon&s;trance produced the de&s;ired effect. They unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved to take arms, and withdrew to their &s;everal habitations, in order to prepare for a general revolt. Their de|&s;ign was communicated to all the cities and boroughs in the kingdom, who joined in the con&s;piracy; and, at the appointed time, the whole nation ro&s;e as one man again&s;t the Engli&s;h garri&s;ons. The&s;e, unable to with&s;tand the rage and enthu&s;ia&s;m of a de&s;perate people, capitulated for their lives, and were per|mitted to leave the kingdom; and in a few days all the Engli&s;h were expelled, except tho&s;e that occupied &s;ome few of the &s;tronge&s;t fortre&s;&s;es, which the Scots were in no condition to be&s;iege.</P>

<P>Edward, who had ju&s;t con&s;ummated his nuptials with Margaret of France, in con&s;equence of the treaty, no &s;ooner heard of the&s;e commotions, than he i&s;&s;ued orders for a&s;&s;embling the troops of the northern counties, and &s;ummoned a parliament at York, to meet in November, where he under&s;tood that the ca&s;tle of Stirling was reduced to extremity. He re&s;olved forthwith to march to the relief of that fortre&s;s; but, when he had proceeded as far as Berwick, the nobility refu&s;ed to &s;erve in the expedition, alledging that the roads of Scotland were unpa&s;&s;ble in that &s;ea&s;on of the year. Thus hampered, he was obliged to de&s;i&s;t from the enterprize, and allow the garri&s;on to make the be&s;t capitulation they could obtain. He re&s;olved, however, to make &s;uch<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hemingford. Rymer.</NOTE> preparation for invading Scotland in the &s;ummer, as would &s;ave him the trouble of a winter campaign for the future. Mean while, he in this parlia|ment confirmed the two charters, and the &s;heriffs over all England were or|dered to publi&s;h them in the county courts every quarter. It was enacted that three knights &s;hould be cho&s;en by the freeholders in every county court, to enforce the execution of the&s;e charters, and puni&s;h tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors in a &s;ummary way, without the tedious forms of the common law. The &s;tatute of Win|ton was likewi&s;e confirmed; and a new law made, under the title of Articuli &s;uper Chartas, enacting that no goods or merchandi&s;e &s;hould be taken with|out payment, by the king's order, except &s;uch as might be nece&s;&s;ary for his hou&s;hold or wardrobe.

<P>The king having taken the&s;e mea&s;ures for the benefit of his &s;ubjects, began to prepare for the final de&s;truction of Scotland; and a&s;&s;embling a nu|merous<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> army, took the field about Mid&s;ummer. As &s;oon as he entered Galloway, he received a propo&s;al from the Scotti&s;h nobility, importing that they would lay down their arms, and &s;ubmit, on condition that he would &s;et their king at liberty, and allow them to ran&s;om their e&s;tates, which he had given away; otherwi&s;e they would defend them&s;elves to the la&s;t extremity. Their reque&s;ts being rejected with di&s;dain, they a&s;&s;embled a great number of men, without arms or di&s;cipline, in hope of finding &s;ome opportunity to &s;ur|prize him in his march; but he proceeded with &s;uch circum&s;pection as baffled all their endeavours; and pur&s;ued them &s;o clo&s;ely that they were at la&s;t obliged to &s;tand a battle, in which they were immediately routed, though not with great &s;laughter; for they fled into fa&s;tne&s;&s;es, through which they could not be pur&s;ued by heavy-armed troops, unacquainted with the &s;ituation of the country. The hopes they had repo&s;ed in their own valour being utterly bla&s;ted by this overthrow, they &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to implore the protection of pope Boniface, and offer him the &s;overeignty of the kingdom. That ambitious pontiff embraced the propo&s;al without he&s;itation, and ordering a bull to be ex|pedited on the &s;ubject, &s;ent it immediately with a letter to archbi&s;hop Win|chel&s;ey, directing him to deliver it into the hands of Edward without delay. The prelate no &s;ooner received this mandate of his holine&s;s, than he &s;et out in per&s;on for Galloway, and found his maje&s;ty in the abbey of Du&s;ques, where he received the papal claim with equal &s;urprize and indignation. The bull contained a great number of arguments to invalidate the preten&s;ions of Edward to the &s;overeignty of Scotland; reproached him with the cruelties he had committed in the pro&s;ecution of the war again&s;t that unfortunate country; and, in particular, with his having impri&s;oned divers bi&s;hops &s;till in confinement: it con&s;tituted the pope as the proper judge of the difference between the Engli&s;h and Scotti&s;h nations; and ordered the king to &s;end amba&s;&s;adors to Rome with proper in&s;truction&s;, within the term of &s;ix months; at the expiration of which he would pronounce a definitive &s;entence. Shocked, as a prince of Edward's haughty di&s;po&s;ition mu&s;t have been, at this in&s;olent addre&s;s, he knew his in|tere&s;t too well to engage in  a quarrel with the pope, at a time when Guienne was &s;eque&s;tred in the hands of that pontiff. Indeed, when he fir&s;t peru&s;ed the contents, he &s;wore, in a tran&s;port of anger, that if the pope per&s;i&s;ted in &s;uch preten&s;ions, he would de&s;troy Scotland from &s;ea to &s;ea; and the Scotti&s;h de|puties, who were pre&s;ent, could not hear &s;uch a menace without emotion. They told him he would find that work more difficult than he imagined; for there was not a Scot in the kingdom who would not &s;pend the la&s;t drop of his blood in defence of his country. This declaration was not a little extraor|dinary, con&s;idering the perfidy with which they had betrayed one another &s;ince the beginning of the war. The king's indignation gave way to his policy. He amu&s;ed the archbi&s;hop with a general an&s;wer, implying, that as it was an affair which concerned the rights of the Engli&s;h crown, he could not make a
<PB N="617" REF="6260">
proper reply until he &s;hould have con&s;ulted his parliament; but, as a proof of his regard for his holine&s;s, he ordered the bi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow to be &s;et at li|berty; returned to England, where he di&s;banded his forces; and, at the re|que&s;t of the French king, con&s;ented to a truce with the Scots until Whit&s;un|tide of the en&s;uing year. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>That Edward was extremely alarmed by this extravagant demand of Boniface, appears from the pains he took to invalidate his preten&s;ions. He convoked a parliament at Lincoln in the beginning of the year, to con&s;ult with them upon this extraordinary affair, and deliberate upon a proper an&s;wer to his holine&s;s. After &s;ome debates, it was re&s;olved that a letter &s;hould be writ|ten<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1301.</NOTE> to the pope, in the name of the barons of England, to this effect: that the crown of England had always enjoyed the right of &s;overeignty over Scot|land; and it was notoriou&s;ly known, that Scotland had never depended, with re&s;pect to temporal&s;, on the &s;ee of Rome: that the parliament would never &s;uffer the king to put his right in litigation, or to &s;end amba&s;&s;adors to Rome on this &s;ubject, even if he &s;hould be inclined to exhibit &s;uch proofs of com|plai&s;ance to his holine&s;s; they therefore de&s;ired he would not attempt to di&s;turb the king or kingdom, in the enjoyment of their prerogatives. This letter, &s;ub&s;cribed by one hundred barons, was followed by another from the king him&s;elf, accompanied with an ab&s;tract, like that which had been read in the a&s;&s;embly at Norham, to prove that the kingdom of Scotland had always been dependant upon the Engli&s;h crown. But with this difference; that whereas the fir&s;t deduced the pretended right from Edward the ancient, this writing traced it back to Brutus, the fir&s;t fabulous king of Albion; and brought it down through all the fictitious reigns recorded in the romance compo&s;ed by Geffrey of Monmouth. Though the&s;e antique fables could have no effect upon the natives of Scotland, he hoped they might make a favourable im|pre&s;&s;ion upon the pope and his Italians, who were not &s;o well ver&s;ed in the hi&s;tory of Britain. Edward's letter was couched in very re&s;pectful terms; &s;o that his holine&s;s could not take exceptions to one expre&s;&s;ion: an in&s;tance of moderation which could hardly have appeared upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, had not the king of England been at the mercy of the pope, with regard to the re&s;titution of Guienne. Neverthele&s;s, he took care to prote&s;t that he did not<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clau&s;. 25. Edw. I.</NOTE> mean this as an appeal in a judicial form, but wrote the detail merely with a view to inform the pope's con&s;cience.</P>

<P>This affair was not more intere&s;ting to the king, than another which now came upon the carpet, was of con&s;equence to the people. The perambulations of the fore&s;ts had been made in every county of England by the king's commi&s;&s;ioners; all exceptions were di&s;cu&s;&s;ed and an&s;wered, and the inque&s;ts and returns being read and approved in this parliament, the king con|firmed them by his letters-patent, declaring that the lands disfore&s;ted by tho&s;e perambulations &s;hould continue &s;o for ever, and the limits now fixed to all the fore&s;ts, remain for ever unaltered and invariable. The laity were &s;o well &s;a|tisfied with this deci&s;ion, which put a &s;top to infinite litigation and oppre&s;&s;ion, that they voted a &s;ub&s;idy of a fifteenth for the expence of the Scotti&s;h war; but archbi&s;hop Winchel&s;ey, at the head of the clergy, refu&s;ed to grant an aid with|out the pope's licence. This prelate, like almo&s;t all his predece&s;&s;ors, was a de&s;pe|rate bigot in every thing that related to the pope's u&s;urped authority. He had excommunicated the king's officers, particularly the warden of the Cinque-Ports,
<PB N="618" REF="6270">
for exerci&s;ing his right of judicature: he had denounced the &s;ame &s;en|tence again&s;t &s;eventeen monks of St. Augu&s;tine, and even impri&s;oned them becau&s;e they in&s;i&s;ted on their privileges: he arrogated to his own courts the cognizance of lay fees; and invaded on all occa&s;ions the rights of the crown, and &s;ecular juri&s;diction: &s;o that the king was continually employed in i&s;&s;uing writs to &s;top his proceedings. Upon his refu&s;al to grant the pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;idy, Edward made application to the pope, in &s;uch a manner that he obtained a tenth, for three years, of all eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues, on condition of its being<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$t. $word$ $or$$$. $word$ R$m$r.</NOTE> divided between the king and his holine&s;s. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the parliament being fini&s;hed, the king created his &s;on Edward prince of Wales and earl of Che&s;ter; and began to make preparations for pro&s;ecuting the war in Scotland: but as the manner of rai&s;ing the aids was too &s;low for the emergencies of the &s;er|vice, he extorted a loan from the trading towns, and compelled the people to pay their rents before they became due, that he might &s;eize this &s;ub&s;idy by anticipation.</P>

The campaign was &s;pent in the$e $$irm$&s;hes, and the reduction of a few incon&s;iderable ca&s;tles; and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

This truce was &s;ignified to the governor, prelates, and nobility of Scotland, who joyfully a&s;&s;ented to the &s;tipulation, which was confirmed and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pry$ne.</NOTE> ratified by Baliol him&s;elf. Edward, however, had privately agreed with the king of France to give up the Scots at the expiration of this truce, in con&s;i|deration of his &s;acrificing his own ally the count of Flanders; and, in confi|dence of this agreement, he carried on his preparations for completing the con|que&s;t of Scotland.

and even freed them&s;elves, in a great mea&s;ure from the Gallic yoke. They had cut in pieces four thou&s;and French troops quartered at Bruges, defeated the count of Artois at Courtray, in a pitched battle, and recovered all the towns and fortre&s;&s;es of Flanders, except Dendermond. Philip had marched again&s;t them in per&s;on without &s;ucce&s;s; and he &s;aw no pro&s;pect of reducing them to obedience, while they &s;hould be &s;upported by England, with which they carried on an advantageous commerce. He therefore expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of engaging in a league of friend&s;hip with Edward: plenipotentiaries were appointed on both &s;ides; and in a little time peace was concluded at Paris, on condition that the territories &s;eized by either party &s;hould be re&s;tored; and &s;a|tisfaction be made for captures: that the ho&s;tages of Guienne, and the pri|&s;oners on both &s;ides, &s;hould be relea&s;ed without ran&s;om. A treaty of free commerce, and a league offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, was e&s;tabli&s;hed: the pope's award for a marriage between the prince of Wales and I&s;abel of France, was confirmed; and the count of Savoy, and the earl of Lincoln, as Edward's proxies, e&s;pou&s;ed the young prince&s;s with great &s;olemnity. This la&s;t noble|man took an oath of fealty to Edward, in the king's name, for Guienne; and it was agreed that Edward &s;hould do homage in per&s;on at Amiens, where the two kings propo&s;ed to have an interview in September. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>While the&s;e affairs were in agitation, Edward &s;ent Seagrave with an army into Scotland rather to ruin the country than fight the natives, who he imagined were in no condition to make the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance. This general divided his forces into three bodies, that marched at the di&s;tance of &s;ome miles from one another; and, as he expected no oppo&s;ition, he proceeded in the mo&s;t carele&s;s &s;ecurity, till he reached Ro&s;lin, in the neighbourhood of Edin|burgh. There he was attacked unexpectedly by the Scotti&s;h army, under the command of Cumin and Frazer, who routed his fir&s;t divi&s;ion, and took him|&s;elf pri&s;oner. The next advanced to the relief of their general; and, as it equalled the Scots in number, charged them with great impetuo&s;ity, which, however, the enemy &s;u&s;tained; and, after an ob&s;tinate engagement, the Scots again proved victorious. When they had ju&s;t fini&s;hed the action, in which they &s;uffered con&s;iderable damage, and a great part of their army was exhau&s;ted with fatigue and lo&s;s of blood, the third divi&s;ion of the Engli&s;h appeared, advancing at a round pace, to retrieve the honour which their countrymen had lo&s;t; and, as their number was con&s;iderably augmented by tho&s;e who e&s;caped from the two former engagements, they approached in full confidence of victory. The Scots, di&s;mayed at their appearance, would have betaken them&s;elves to flight, had not they been re&s;trained by the remon&s;trances of their leaders, who exhorted them to make one effort more to augment the glory they had won, and pre&s;erve the &s;poils they had gathered.

<P>Edward, who entered Scotland about Whit&s;untide, advanced to Edinburgh without having met with any con&s;iderable oppo&s;ition. A party of the Scots &s;till kept the field under Wallace, and the ca&s;tle of Stirling had been taken by Cumin. Edward would not, however, &s;tay to inve&s;t that fortre&s;s; becau&s;e he wanted to penetrate into the northern &s;hires, in order to cut off the communication between the different parts of the country, and prevent the enemy from joining their forces. He did not expect to meet with any re|&s;i&s;tance in this progre&s;s; but he was mi&s;taken. The ca&s;tle of Brechin, com|manded by Thomas Maule, refu&s;ed to &s;urrender; and he was obliged to un|dertake a regular &s;iege, and ply all his engines for twenty days without &s;uc|ce&s;s. The governor &s;eemed to make light of his endeavours, and even pro|voked him by exhibiting &s;ome marks of contempt, which, however, co&s;t him his life; for, as he wiped the wall with his handkerchief, in deri&s;ion of Ed|ward's batteries, he was killed by a &s;tone from one of the&s;e engines; and his death produced &s;uch a con&s;ternation in the garri&s;on that they &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion. The king would have found it impracticable to pro&s;ecute his march in this barren and de&s;olate country, had not he been &s;upplied from his fleet, which attended him upon the coa&s;t: but, thus provided, he continued his route to the ca&s;tle of Urquhart, commanded by Alexander Wood, who &s;tood an a&s;&s;ault, and was put to the &s;word with his whole garri&s;on. He found no further oppo&s;ition in his progre&s;s to the nothern extremity of Scotland; from whence he returned to Dumfermling, and &s;ummoned William Oliphant to &s;urrender the ca&s;tle of Stirling, which he had before &s;o gallantly defended. That officer refu&s;ing to &s;ubmit, the king re&s;olved to be&s;iege the place in form, as &s;oon as the weather would permit; and during the winter prepared his mi|litary<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1304.</NOTE> engines for reducing that important fortre&s;s. In the beginning of May he appeared before the ca&s;tle, and carried on his operations with his u&s;ual im|petuo&s;ity: but, notwith&s;tanding all his efforts, the garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of three hundred men, defended it to the latter end of July, when the ditches being filled up, a con&s;iderable breach effected, and the Engli&s;h army ready to give the a&s;&s;ault, the governor, with about one hundred and forty of his people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ We&s;tmo$.

<P>After the reduction of this fortre&s;s, the Scots de&s;pairing of a&s;|&s;i&s;tance from the king of France, who had abandoned their intere&s;t, were fain to renew their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the conqueror; and Edward having found the bad effects of driving them to de&s;pair, thought proper to abate of his former &s;everity. Cumin the guardian &s;ent deputies to &s;ue for peace and pardon; and after &s;ome conferences, it was agreed that he and his friends &s;hould be pardoned, upon their payment of a ran&s;om or fine to be impo&s;ed in this next parliament, when the affairs of Scotland &s;hould be regulated; that all the
<PB N="621" REF="6300">
&s;trong holds &s;hould remain in the hands of the king; and that the pri&s;oners on both &s;ides &s;hould be relea&s;ed. Several per&s;ons who had been active in the re|volt again&s;t Edward, were excluded nominally from the benefit of this par|don, except upon certain hard conditions; and it was expre&s;sly &s;tipulated that Wallace &s;hould have no terms, but &s;ubmit entirely to the mercy of the king. By this agreement, which was &s;igned at Strathorde, the Scotti&s;h agents at Paris were allowed &s;ufficient time to return and make their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion: John Cumin, and his adherents, did homage and &s;wore fealty at Dumferling to Edward, who having &s;ubdued all oppo&s;ition in Scotland, ordered the ju&s;tices of his bench, with the courts of exchequer and chancery, to be removed from York to We&s;tmin&s;ter, while he him&s;elf &s;et out for England; and making a progre&s;s through the northern counties, repaired to Lincoln, where he pa&s;&s;ed the Chri&s;t|mas holidays. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ryley.</NOTE></P>

<P>During the king's ab&s;ence, England had been expo&s;ed to num|berle&s;s<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1305.</NOTE> di&s;orders, ari&s;ing from the licence of the time, and a defect in the civil polity of the kingdom. In the we&s;tern counties, bordering upon Wales, robberies, murders, and other outrages, were daily commited with impunity; for the perpetrators of tho&s;e enormities were &s;o numerous and formidable, as to &s;et the officers of ju&s;tice at defiance. In order to put a &s;top to &s;uch out|rages, the king called a parliament at We&s;tmin&s;ter, where commi&s;&s;ioners of inque&s;t were i&s;&s;ued to the ju&s;tices to examine into tho&s;e exce&s;&s;es; to try the authors by juries, in a &s;ummary way, and bring them immediately to condign puni&s;hment. In con&s;equence of the&s;e powers, known by the name of writs of Trayle-ba&s;ton, a great number of malefactors was put to death; many were puni&s;hed with &s;evere fines, and the re&s;t fled the kingdom. By this time Edward<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer. Ryley.</NOTE> had changed his plan of behaviour to the natives of Scotland. In&s;tead of that contempt and &s;everity with which he had treated them hitherto, he now adopted a more complai&s;ant demeanour, which was the effect of true policy. He not only allowed them to ran&s;om their lands, but re&s;olved to attach their chief noblemen and prelates to his intere&s;t, by offices of kindne&s;s. Robert de Brus, earl of Carrick, and &s;on to the competitor, dying at this period, his &s;on of the &s;ame name had livery of his lands upon doing homage to the king of England, who be&s;towed particular marks of favour upon him, and two of his countrymen, namely, John Mowbray and the bi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow; though all three had violently oppo&s;ed him in the la&s;t in&s;urrection. He now de&s;ired them to con&s;ider of a proper time and place for convening a par|liament, that &s;hould regulate the civil government of Scotland; and, in pur|&s;uance of their advice, ten deputies were appointed to come and treat with the Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners, at a parliament &s;ummoned to meet in September for that purpo&s;e. There it was agreed that eight ju&s;tices &s;hould be con&s;tituted to regulate the affairs of the nation. John de Bretagne, the king's nephew, was created guardian of the realm; and William de Bevercotes, and John de Sandale, both clergymen, were continued in the po&s;ts of chancellor and cham|berlain of the kingdom. It was re&s;olved that the laws and u&s;ages of the Scots &s;hould be aboli&s;hed; and that a parliament &s;hould be a&s;&s;embled in Scotland, under the eye of the guardian, to con&s;ider the laws of king David, and the amendments which had been made in them by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors: that without con&s;ulting the king they &s;hould alter and reform all &s;uch laws and cu&s;toms as
<PB N="622" REF="6310">
&s;hou$d appear incon&s;i&s;tent with religion and rea&s;on; and that tho&s;e articles in which his interpo&s;ition might be nece&s;&s;ary, &s;hould be ingro&s;&s;ed in writing, and &s;ent by deputies from the &s;tates of Scotland to the parliament of England, where they &s;hould be examined and di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, with the concurrence of tho&s;e deputies empowered for that purpo&s;e by their con&s;tituents. At the clo&s;e of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, Edward publi&s;hed an act of indemnity in favour of the Scots who had &s;ubmitted: yet this was clogged with certain re&s;trictions, that bore hard upon &s;ome individuals; and Bruce was obliged to &s;urrender the &s;trong ca&s;tle of Kil|drummy. The king was jealous of this earl's talents and influence; and for that rea&s;on took care that he &s;hould not be included in the li&s;t of commi&s;&s;ion|ers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> All the Scotti&s;h prelates and nobility then at London, together with the deputies, took an oath to ob&s;erve the&s;e regulations; but the earl of Carrick had been &s;ent to Scotland in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the convention which no|minated the deputies of that kingdom. There his ambition was &s;timulated, by re&s;entment of the wrong he had &s;u&s;tained in the lo&s;s of his ca&s;tle; and he began to form that plan which he afterwards executed with incredible fortitude and per&s;everance.</P>

<P>In all probability he would have a&s;&s;ociated Wallace in his coun|cils, had not that truly great man been delivered into the hands of the Eng|li&s;h by Sir John Monteith, Edward's Scotti&s;h favourite, and governor of the ca&s;tle of Dunbarton. The Scotti&s;h writers alledge that he was betrayed in the mo&s;t perfidious manner, and apprehended as he lay a&s;leep in the neighbourhood of Gla&s;gow. But although he was &s;urprized by a party under the command of Monteith, he cannot be ju&s;tly &s;aid to have been betrayed, as that officer was a profe&s;&s;ed adherent of king Edward. This renowned pri&s;oner was im|mediately conveyed to London, in the mid&s;t of infinite crouds of people, a&s;&s;embled to &s;ee the man who&s;e name had filled the whole country with terror. On the very next day he was brought to his trial at We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, where he was placed upon a high chair, and crowned with laurel in deri&s;ion. Being accu&s;ed of trea&s;on, he pleaded not guilty, and refu&s;ed to own the juri&s;diction of the court; affirming it was equally unju&s;t and ab&s;urd to charge him with trea&s;on again&s;t a prince who&s;e &s;overeignty he had never acknowledged; and that as he was a free-born native of an independent nation, he could not be deemed &s;ubject to the laws of England. The judges over-ruled his plea; and, upon the maxim of Edward's being the immediate &s;overeign of Scotland, found him guilty of high trea&s;on. He was condemned to die the death of a traitor; and the &s;entence being executed with all the circum&s;tances of barba|rity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ry$ey.</NOTE> his head and quarters were expo&s;ed in the chief cities of England. This was a mean triumph in Edward, over a man of who&s;e reputation he was en|vious. The Engli&s;h hi&s;torians repre&s;ent Wallace as a ruffian, who had com|mitted the mo&s;t &s;hocking cruelties upon women and infants, in the cour&s;e of his expeditions. The Scots extol him as an unblemi&s;hed hero. Had he been really guilty of &s;uch barbarities, it would have been much more for the repu|tation of Edward to try him on account of tho&s;e crimes, than to convict him upon an impeachment which has left an indelible &s;tain upon his own memory. Edward was a prince of great courage and abilities; but there was nothing liberal in his di&s;po&s;ition. He had &s;een repeated proofs of this man's invin|cible prowe&s;s and patrioti&s;m; he had made repeated efforts to corrupt his in|tegrity;
<PB N="623" REF="6320">
he mu&s;t have admired his character when he &s;acrificed him to his jealou&s;y and revenge. Edward condemned him as a traitor; Henry II. would have revered him as an hero.</P>

<DIV4 N="65" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; LXV.</HEAD>
<P>Robert de Brus, father to the pre&s;ent earl of Carrick, had al|ways con&s;idered Wallace as an ambitious up&s;tart, who a&s;pired to the crown of Scotland; and in this opinion per&s;ecuted him with uncea&s;ing hatred, until they had an occa&s;ional conference immediately after the battle of Falkirk. Bruce was then in the &s;ervice of Edward, and at the head of a &s;trong detach|ment endeavoured to cut off the retreat of the Scotti&s;h regent: but finding him&s;elf baffled by the conduct of Wallace, who by this time had pa&s;&s;ed the river Carron, he called aloud to him, and upbraided him with his &s;uppo&s;ed attempt upon the &s;overeignty of his country. The regent, from the other bank, made &s;uch a reply as the integrity of his own heart &s;ugge&s;ted, and in his turn reproached Bruce with his &s;ervile adherence to the implacable enemy of Scotland, who had already de&s;troyed the independency of that crown, which it was the duty of Bruce in a peculiar manner to defend. His words made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on the mind of Robert, who was never afterwards hearty in Edward's intere&s;t; and he communicated &s;uch a favourable idea of Wallace to his &s;on, that this noblemen would undoubtedly have had recour&s;e to his advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, had not his de&s;ign been anticipated by the un|worthy fate of that un&s;haken patriot. Thus di&s;appointed, he ca&s;t his eyes on Cumin, who had &s;ucceeded Wallace in the regency. He was a young nobleman of great power and intere&s;t, and Baliol, to whom he was related, having abdicated the throne, he &s;ucceeded as competitor with Bruce for the &s;o|vereignty. The earl of Carrick, con&s;cious of his own a&s;piring genius, which predominated over the fortune of his rival, found means to &s;ound the inclina|tions of Cumin, and to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch an under&s;tanding between them, that a treaty was concluded and ratified by oath, and an indenture drawn, by which Cumin engaged to &s;upport Bruce with all his intere&s;t, in his attempts to a&s;cend the throne. In con&s;ideration of which a&s;&s;i&s;tance, Bruce obliged him|&s;elf to acknowledge Cumin as fir&s;t prince of the blood, and be&s;tow upon him all the private patrimony which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as earl of Carrick. Cumin, either terrified at the dangerous confederacy in which he had engaged, or with a view to de&s;troy his rival, and conciliate the favour of Edward at the &s;ame time, &s;ent a tran&s;cript of his agreement with Bruce to the king of England, who re|ceived it ju&s;t as the earl of Carrick arrived in London, to concert mea&s;ures with &s;ome of the Scotti&s;h nobility who had come up to &s;ettle the affairs of their nation in the la&s;t parliament. Edward &s;ent for him to court, and pro|duced the indenture, which Bruce affirmed to be a forgery; and the king, who was a little &s;taggered in his opinion, did not think proper to commit him to clo&s;e cu&s;tody; though he ordered him to be &s;urrounded with &s;pies, in &s;uch a manner that all his words and actions reached the knowledge of the king, who at la&s;t re&s;olved to &s;ecure his per&s;on. Before he executed this re&s;olution, Robert's brother-in-law, the earl of Glouce&s;ter, being apprized of the king's intention, &s;ent a few pieces of money, and a pair of &s;purs, to the earl of Car|rick, on pretence of re&s;toring what he had borrowed. Bruce conceiving the meaning of the&s;e emblems, took hor&s;e immediately, and in &s;even days arrived in his own ca&s;tle at Lochmaban, where he found &s;ome of his particular friends, to whom he communicated the treachery of Cumin. Hearing that
<PB N="624" REF="6330">
nobleman was then at Dumfries, he went thither to expoftulate with him upon his perfidy; and meeting him in the cloi&s;ters of a mona&s;tery belonging to the Grey-friars, reproached him in &s;evere terms for his per&s;idious conduct. Cumin retorted his obloquy, and a virulent altercation en&s;uing, Bruce, in a tran&s;port of pa&s;&s;ion, plunged his poignard in the other's brea&s;t. After having com|mitted this a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, he retired and mounted his hor&s;e, when his atten|dants perceiving marks of confu&s;ion in his countenance, de&s;ired to know what<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1306.</NOTE> had pa&s;&s;ed in the interview with Cumin. He then recounted the particulars of the conver&s;ation; and Sir Chri&s;topher Seton, who, though an Engli&s;hman, was one of his mo&s;t zealous parti&s;ans, hearing the circum&s;tance of Cumin's being wounded, "What! (&s;aid he) "have you left the work half done." So &s;aying he repaired to the cloi&s;ters, with &s;ome followers, and under&s;tanding the monks had removed Cumin into the church, that he might confe&s;s his &s;ins and receive ab&s;olution, he advanced to the altar, which he &s;tained with the blood of that unhappy nobleman, and a knight of the &s;ame name who<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. We&s;t. Hemingford.</NOTE> came to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The behaviour of Bruce was &s;avage; but that of Seton was altogether impious and inhuman. Bruce &s;eeing all competition removed by the death of Cumin, began to take mea&s;ures for a&s;cending the Scotti&s;h throne, which had been vacant &s;ince the depo&s;ition of John Baliol; and to which Ro|bert thought he acquired a new claim by the death of that unhappy prince, which happened in France about this period. He had long ago lo&s;t the af|fection and e&s;teem of his &s;ubjects; and his &s;on Edward, who remained a pri|&s;oner in England, was unheeded and unknown on the north &s;ide of the Tweed; &s;o that his intere&s;t could not interfere$ with the projects of greatne&s;s formed by the earl of Carrick.</P>

<P>While this a&s;piring young nobleman employed his extraordinary talents and exten&s;ive influence, in &s;ecuring the &s;uffrages of his countrymen for rai&s;ing him to the &s;overeignty of Scotland, Edward's attention was engro&s;&s;ed by &s;ome unpopular mea&s;ures, which might have been productive of very mi&s;|chievous con&s;equences. He was &s;o jealous of his authority, that he never forgave any per&s;on who pre&s;umed to di&s;pute his prerogative, or di&s;obey his regulations. Nicholas Seagrave, one of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed knights of the age, being accu&s;ed of &s;ome mi&s;demeanour, appealed to the trial by &s;ingle combat, which the king refu&s;ing, he challenged his accu&s;er to meet him in another kingdom; and went abroad for that purpo&s;e. At his return he was apprehended by the king's order, and tried before the judges, who found him guilty of trea&s;on, and condemned him to death; though the &s;entence was qua|lified with a clau&s;e empowering the king to indulge him with a pardon. Ed|ward was incen&s;ed at their pre&s;umption, in attempting to limit his preroga|tive, and reviled them in the mo&s;t indecent terms: Seagrave, however, was pardoned and &s;et at liberty, by the interce&s;&s;ion of &s;ome noblemen, who under|took to be re&s;pon&s;ible for his future behaviour. The king was &s;o punctual with re&s;pect to the ob&s;ervance of the laws, that he puni&s;hed delinquents, with|out re&s;pect of per&s;ons. His own &s;on prince Edward, being influenced by his favourite Piers Gave&s;ton$ to in&s;ult the bi&s;hop of Che&s;ter, his father gave or|ders to commit him to the public pri&s;on, that he might learn to re&s;pect ju&s;tice before he &s;hould become her vicegerent: or rather that he might be deterred from revolting again&s;t the authority of his &s;overeign. All Edward's views were directed to the increa&s;e and e&s;tabli&s;hment of his own grandeur; and
<PB N="623" REF="6340">
all the &s;alutary laws which he enacted, were either extorted by the clamours of his people, whom he would not venture to exa&s;perate, or calculated for the purpo&s;es of his ambition. Boniface dying at this period, was &s;ucceeded by Clement V. a native of Bourdeaux, and creature of Edward, who &s;ollicited a di&s;pen&s;ation of the oath he had taken to ob&s;erve the two charters; and the new pope made no difficulty of ab&s;olving him from a promi&s;e which the king re|pre&s;ented as the effects of compul&s;ion. The Engli&s;h people were not a little<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. Public.</NOTE> alarmed at this di&s;pen&s;ation, which &s;eemed the prelude of arbitrary power; and Edward's &s;ub&s;equent conduct ju&s;tified their apprehen&s;ion. Finding the nation unwilling to grant &s;uch &s;ub&s;idies as he demanded to maintain the war, he had recour&s;e to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the pope, who granted a tenth upon the clergy for three years, on condition that he him&s;elf &s;hould retain one half for his own occa&s;ions. This &s;candalous traffic gave &s;uch offence to the kingdom, that the parliament remon&s;trated again&s;t it, and even forbade the collectors to levy the impo&s;ition: but the king was re&s;olved to be obeyed, and the col|lectors were commanded to proceed, on pain of his di&s;plea&s;ure. The&s;e funds being in&s;ufficient to defray the expence of the war, he re&s;olved to levy a &s;cutage on pretence of his &s;on's knighthood; and to render this tax the le&s;s unpalatable, he invited all the young gentlemen, who were ambitious of that honour, to come and be knighted with prince Edward at We&s;tmin&s;ter, where they &s;hould receive the robes &s;uited to that dignity. At the &s;ame time he &s;ummoned a parliament, from which he demanded a &s;upply; and received a thirtieth of temporalities belonging to the clergy and lay-noblemen, knights, and com|monalty, except the boroughs and towns of the king's deme&s;nes, which were obliged to pay a twentieth of all their moveables. Such a number of young noblemen, and others, a&s;&s;embled in con&s;equence of Edward's invitation, that the royal palace not &s;ufficing for their accommodation, they were entertained in tents and pavilions pitched in the garden of the New Temple. They after|wards kept their vigils in We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey with prince Edward, who was next day knighted by his father in the palace; and from thence repairing to the church of We&s;tmin&s;ter, conferred the &s;ame dignity at the high altar upon two hundred and fifty young noblemen, who being thus dubbed his companions, engaged to attend him in the expedition to Scotland, which the king could no longer defer with any regard to his own honour and advan|tage. <NOTE PLACE="marg">M.

<P>Bruce, immediately after the murder of Cumin, &s;urprized the ca&s;tle of Dumfries, and apprehended the Engli&s;h judges, who &s;at in the great hall to hear and determine cau&s;es. Then traver&s;ing the country with a body of his va&s;&s;als, he reduced a number of fortre&s;&s;$s, and expelled the Engli&s;h from the kingdom. In a little time he was joined by a majority of the Scotti&s;h nation, who were glad of an opportunity to &s;nake off the yoke of Edward, whom they dete&s;ted; and at length he was crowned at Scone, by the hands of the counte&s;s of Buchan, &s;i&s;ter to the earl of Fife, who was attached to the &s;ervice of Edward. This was a privilege inherent in that family; and the counte&s;s claimed the honour of the function, which &s;he performed in the pre|&s;ence of the bi&s;hops of St. Andrews, Gla&s;gow, Murray, and a good number of noblemen. Edward, apprized of the&s;e tran&s;actions, vowed revenge again&s;t the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heming$$rd.</NOTE> whole Scotti&s;h nation, which he re&s;olved to en&s;lave. He &s;ummoned his pre|la$es,

nobility, and all who held by knights &s;ervice, to meet him at Carlile, which was appointed as the general rendezvous; and con&s;tituted the archbi&s;hop of York, and $he bi&s;hop of Litchfield, guardians of England during his ab|&s;ence. Mean while he detached a body of forces into Scotland, under the command of Aymer de Valence, Henry de Percy, and Robert de Clifford, who advanced as far as Perth, where Robert de Brus challenged them to battle, which they thought proper to decline. After this bravado he encamped at M$thuen, and his &s;oldiers de&s;pi&s;ing an enemy who dur&s;t not meet them in the field$ began to enjoy their repo&s;e and refre&s;hment in the mo&s;t blind &s;ecurity, when the Engli&s;h attacked them in the evening &s;o &s;uddenly, that their leader had not time to draw them up in order of battle. Neverthele&s;s, he made a gallant re&s;i&s;tance, and was three times di&s;mounted, and as often relieved by the bravery of Simon de Fra&s;er. But at length his army being routed, he e&s;caped with a few followers to Dalree, on the frontiers of Argyle: a good number of his troops fled to the mountains; but a great number of per&s;ons of di&s;tinction were taken and executed on the &s;pot as traitors.</P>

<P>Immediately after this victory Edward entered Scotland, and divided his army into two &s;eparate bodies. One of the&s;e marched northward under the command of prince Edward, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the earls of Lanca&s;ter and Hereford, and &s;urprized the ca&s;tle of Kildrummy, in which they found the wife and &s;i&s;ter of Robert de Brus, with his brother Niel, and &s;everal per&s;ons of quality. His other two brothers, Thomas and Alexander, were afterterwards taken in the ca&s;tle of Lochryan in Cantyre, from which Robert him&s;elf e&s;caped with difficulty; and Edward met with no further re&s;i&s;tance in his progre&s;s through Scotland. His anger was di&s;appointed in the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the na|tives. He was a&s;hamed to extirpate tho&s;e who made no oppo&s;ition; and the blood of his pri&s;oners was not &s;ufficient to a&s;&s;uage the thir&s;t and fury of his indignation. The guardian and ju&s;tices were directed to proclaim in all cities, boroughs, or market towns, that all who were concerned in the la&s;t rebellion again&s;t the king, &s;hould be pur&s;ued with hue and cry, until apprehended dead or alive; and that tho&s;e who neglected to pro&s;ecute them in this manner, &s;hould forfeit their effects, and be impri&s;oned during his maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure; that tho&s;e concerned in the death of John Cumin &s;hould be put to death with|out mercy, as well as tho&s;e by whom they were harboured and entertained; that tho&s;e who acted again&s;t the king's peace &s;hould be impri&s;oned during the king's plea&s;ure; and that &s;uch as were pre&s;&s;ed into the rebellion, &s;hould be fined according to the judgment of the guardian. After having publi&s;hed the&s;e injunctions, under the &s;eal of Scotland, Edward gave a loo&s;e to vengeance, and under the &s;hadow of ju&s;tice &s;acrificed his captives to revenge. The &s;i&s;ter of Bruce, and counte&s;s of Buchan, were &s;hut up in wooden cages, and hung over the battlements of different ca&s;tles: the execution of private per&s;ons be|came &s;o common that it was no longer regarded. The bi&s;hops of St. Andrews and Gla&s;gow were loaded with chains, and committed to dungeons. The wife of Bruce was &s;ent captive into England, of which &s;he was a native; the earl of Athole was hanged at London: this was likewi&s;e the fate of Simon de Fra&s;er; Herbert Norham and Thomas Boyd were beheaded; Chri&s;topher de Seton was drawn, hanged, and quartered; and the two brothers of Bruce fell<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> by the hands of the common executioner. Edward fir&s;t compelled tho&s;e un|happy
<PB N="625" REF="6360">
happy people to take the oath of allegiance; then provoked them by op|pre&s;&s;ion to renounce that engagement; and la&s;tly puni&s;hed them as traitors. He ought to have con&s;idered that pope Boniface had as good a right to relea&s;e Bruce and his followers from the oath they had taken to Edward king of Eng|land, as pope Clement had to ab&s;olve Edward from the oath he had taken to his own &s;ubjects.</P>

<P>Edward having reduced Scotland to &s;uch an abject &s;tate of help|le&s;s mi&s;ery, as he thought would di&s;able the inhabitants from any future re|volt; and taking it for granted that Robert de Bruce had peri&s;hed by famine or the &s;word, returned to Carlile, where he &s;ummoned a parliament, to re|dre&s;s the grievances of mona&s;teries and religious hou&s;es, which were burthened with talliages, tributes, and other impo&s;itions, by the agents of the pope, on pretence of vi&s;itations contrary to the laws and cu&s;toms of the kingdom. The&s;e exactions were condemned as injurious to the crown, and prejudicial to the country; and a letter was written to the pope, in the name of the clergy and laity, complaining of the practice of his mini&s;ters, and de&s;iring his holine&s;s to prevent &s;uch abu&s;e for the future. Te&s;ta, the pope's chief agent, was &s;um|moned before the parliament, and forbid to levy any more money in his ma&s;ter's name. He was even ordered to keep what he had already collected, until the king &s;hould di&s;po&s;e of it by the advice of his council; and writs were i&s;&s;ued to &s;eize and impri&s;on all &s;uch per&s;ons as he had employed in tho&s;e and other extortions. The&s;e proceedings, however, were &s;topped at the interce&s;|&s;ion<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1307.</NOTE> of the new legate Peter D'E&s;pagne, whom his holine&s;s had &s;ent over to fini&s;h the marriage of the prince of Wales, which was retarded by a di&s;pute about the ca&s;tle of Mauleon in Ga&s;cony. This important fortre&s;s had been given by Philip to a certain knight, who now refu&s;ed to cede it without an equivalent; and Edward would not allow his &s;on to con&s;ummate the nuptials, until this ca&s;tle and its territory &s;hould be re&s;tored. The prince of Wales was not di&s;plea&s;ed at this delay of a match that could not but interfere with the gratification of his pa&s;&s;ions. He had already exhibited &s;igns of an idle, vicious, and di&s;olute di&s;po&s;ition; and his exce&s;&s;es &s;eemed to multiply as his years in|crea&s;ed. He had been bani&s;hed from court for in&s;ulting the bi&s;hop of Litch|field, and &s;everely reprimanded by his father for his profligacy and extrava|gance, &s;o oppo&s;ite to his own par&s;imony and love of order: but his irre|gularities becoming every day more and more intolerable, and Piers Gave&s;ton being &s;uppo&s;ed to be the author of the evil coun&s;el by which he was influ|enced, the king bani&s;hed this favourite from the realm; and one hundred marks a year, to be payed out of the revenue of Guienne, were allowed for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hemingford.</NOTE></P>

<P>During this &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, Edward being informed of fre&s;h commotions excited in the highlands by Robert de Brus, who was &s;till alive and indefatigable, prevailed upon the pope's legate to denounce the &s;entence of excommunication again&s;t him and all his abettors, and re&s;olved to march in per&s;on in the &s;pring to ferret him out of his lurking-places. After the battle of Methuen, Bruce had retired with the wreck of his forces to the borders of Argyle, where he was again routed by the lord Lorn, a tru&s;ty adherent of Ed|ward; and obliged to lurk in woods and caverns, attended by the earl of Len|nox and Gilbert Hay, who would not abandon him in his di&s;tre&s;s. In this
<PB N="626" REF="6370">
condition, he had no &s;u&s;tenance but that which he enjoyed in common with the bea&s;ts of the f$eld, and the fowls of heaven; and he was hunted by his own countrymen f$$m rock to rock, like an enemy to mankind. From this per|&s;ecution he withdrew to a little i&s;land called Raughrine, where he lay concealed until the report of his death prevailed over all the neighbouring country; and though he was expo&s;ed to all the mi&s;eries of want, and all the inclemencies of weather, he never betrayed the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of dejection, nor re&s;igned the hope of being one day able to re-a&s;cend the throne of Scotland, and vindicate the independence of his crown. When he heard that Edward had returned to Carlile, he found means to make his friends acquainted with his being alive; a &s;mall body of half armed troops being a&s;&s;embled by Sir James Douglas, and Sir Robert Boyd, he came forth from his retreat, and putting him&s;elf at their head, attacked and cut off an Engli&s;h detachment which guarded a con|voy of provi&s;ions. This was a very valuable acqui&s;ition, in a double re&s;pect; for he not only acquired &s;tore of provi&s;ions, at a time when he wanted &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence, but was enabled to arm his followers; with whom, though they did not exceed four hundred, he took the ca&s;tle of Turnberry, and obliged the lord Henry Percy, who commanded in tho&s;e parts, to retreat towards the bor|ders of England. Edward was no &s;ooner apprized of the&s;e exploits, which were performed in the &s;evere&s;t &s;ea&s;on of the year, than he ordered the earl of Pembroke, and the lord Lorn, who had defeated him in the preceding year, to take the field and cru&s;h him in the infancy of his good fortune; and this order they executed with &s;uch indu&s;try and expedition, that Bruce found him|&s;elf in danger of being &s;urrounded on a mountain, where he mu&s;t either have peri&s;hed by famine or &s;urrendered to his enemies, if he had not been able to accompli&s;h an e&s;cape. Perceiving the highlanders under lord Lorn taking a compa&s;s round the hill, in order to cut off his retreat, he harrangued his &s;mall body of troops, that did not yet amount to a thou&s;and, and repre&s;enting the inevitable de&s;truction to which they mu&s;t have been expo&s;ed by remaining in their entrenchments, he exhorted them to di&s;per&s;e into &s;mall parties, by which means they would vani&s;h imperceptibly from their enemies; and he de|&s;ired they would meet him at a certain time in the wood of Glentroule, near Cumnock. Having received the&s;e directions, they &s;eemed to melt away in|&s;en&s;ibly, and e&s;caped by the help of the rocks and &s;hrubs that &s;heltered them from the view of their adver&s;aries, who were not a little confounded at their di&s;appointment, when they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hill, and found the entrench|ments of Bruce entirely abandoned. The fugitive prince having re-a&s;&s;embled his friends at the place appointed, was joined by &s;mall reinforcements, which enabled him to maintain the footing he had gained. The earl of Pembroke following him from one retreat to another, he at la&s;t decoyed that nobleman into a di&s;advantageous &s;ituation, and fell upon him with &s;uch fury that the Engli&s;h troops were defeated. He afterwards attacked a detachment com|manded by the earl of Glouce&s;ter, who, after an ob&s;tinate di&s;pute, was obliged to take refuge in the ca&s;tle of Aire, which Robert immediately in|ve&s;ted. The&s;e atchievements revived the drooping &s;pirits of the Scots, who now flocked to his banner; &s;o that in a little time his army was encrea&s;ed to ten thou&s;and men, though they were generally unarmed, and utterly ignorant of di&s;cipline.</P>

<P>Mean while Edward remained at Carli&s;le, impatiently waiting for the troops he had &s;ummoned, in order to extirpate the Scotti&s;h name; and the fir&s;t that a&s;&s;embled were &s;ent immediately to relieve the earl of Glouce&s;ter. Bruce &s;eeing the Engli&s;h advance, thought proper to rai&s;e the &s;iege: but he could not retreat with &s;uch expedition but that he was attacked and routed; and obliged to fly for &s;helter to inacce&s;&s;ible fa&s;tne&s;&s;es, where he remained till the death of Edward. The period of this great prince's life now ap|proached. He was &s;eized with a dy&s;entery at Carlile; and though the di&s;tem|per was deemed extremely dangerous, he was inflamed with &s;uch a de&s;ire of wreaking his vengeance upon the enemy, that he began his march for Scot|land, and proceeded as far as a place called Burgh on the Sands, where, finding nature almo&s;t exhau&s;ted, he gave directions that even after his death he &s;hould be carried into Scotland, as a &s;ure pre&s;age of victory over a people whom he had always defeated. Then he regulated his &s;piritual concerns, and expired in the arms of his &s;ervants, while they rai&s;ed him up that he might take &s;ome nouri&s;hment. Thus died Edward I. king of England, on the &s;eventh day of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hemingford. Mat. We&s;t.</NOTE> July, after having reigned four and thirty years with great reputation and &s;ucce&s;s. He was a prince of a very dignified appearance; tall in &s;tature, re|gular and comely in his features, with keen piercing black eyes; and of an a&s;pect that commanded reverence and e&s;teem. His con&s;titution was robu&s;t; his &s;trength and dexterity perhaps unequalled in his kingdom; and his &s;hape was unblemi&s;hed in all other re&s;pects but that of his legs, which are &s;aid to have been too long in proportion to his body; whence he derived the epithet of Long Shanks. In the qualities of the head he equalled the greate&s;t monarchs who have &s;at on the Engli&s;h throne: he was cool, penetrating, &s;agacious, and cir|cum&s;pect. The remote&s;t corners of the earth re&s;ounded with the fame of his courage; and all over Europe he was con&s;idered as the flower of chivalry. Nor was he le&s;s con&s;ummate in his legi&s;lative capacity than eminent for his military prowe&s;s. He may be &s;tiled the Engli&s;h Ju&s;tinian: for, be&s;ides the excellent &s;tatutes that were enacted in his reign, he new-modelled the admini|&s;tration of ju&s;tice, &s;o as to render it more &s;ure and &s;ummary; he fixed proper bounds to the different courts of juri&s;diction; &s;ettled a new and ea&s;y method of collecting the revenue, and e&s;tabli&s;hed wi&s;e and effectual regulations for pre|&s;erving peace and order among his &s;ubjects. Yet, with all the&s;e good quali|ties, he cheri&s;hed a dangerous ambition, to which he did not &s;cruple to &s;acri|fice the good of his country: witne&s;s his ruinous war with Scotland, which drained the kingdom of men and money, and gave ri&s;e to that rancorous enmity which in the &s;equel proved &s;o prejudicial to both nations. That he was arbitrary in his di&s;po&s;ition appears in many in&s;tances of his reign, particularly that of &s;eizing for his own u&s;e the merchandize of his &s;ubjects; a &s;tretch of prerogative more &s;uitable to the conduct of an ea&s;tern emperor, than to that of an Engli&s;h monarch. The cruelty of his nature was manife&s;ted in every expedition he undertook, either in Wales or Scotland. His integrity may be que&s;tioned from the nature of his tran&s;actions with the competitors of the Scotti&s;h crown; and the renunciation of the oath he had taken to his &s;ub|jects. Though he is celebrated for his cha&s;tity and regular deportment, there is not, in the whole cour&s;e of his reign, one in&s;tance of liberality or munificence.

<P>THE glory of England &s;eemed to &s;et with Edward I. His &s;on and &s;ucc$&s;&s;or, Edward of Caernarvon, neither inherited his talents, nor took the lea&s;t pains to execute his de&s;igns, and follow his advice. In&s;tead of pro&s;ecuting the war again&s;t Scotland, according to the injunctions he had re|ceived from his father, he took no effectual &s;tep to check the progre&s;s of Bruce; and his march into that country was rather a proce&s;&s;ion of pageantry than an expedition. After having been proclaimed at Carlile, and received the oath of $llegiance from the prelates and nobility of England, he repaired to Rox|burgh and Dumfries, to receive the homage of the Scots; and &s;eemed to be hig$ly delighted with the ceremonies which attended the &s;olemnity. Then advancing at the head of his army as far as Chimmock, he empowered Aymer earl of Pembroke to treat with the Scots concerning a pacification, and ap|pointed him guardian of that kingdom; though that office was afterwards be|&s;towed upon John de Bretagne, and the po&s;t of chamberlain was conferred<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$mer.</NOTE> upon Eu&s;tace de Coti&s;bache. Edward having made this ridiculous parade, re|turned to England, where, in direct oppo&s;ition to the promi&s;e he had &s;olemnly made to his father, he recalled his favourite Piers Gave&s;ton, to whom he made a grant of the whole e&s;tate belonging to the late $arl of Cornwal. Not content with having exhibited this extravagant mark $f his favour and affection, he pre&s;ented him with the &s;um of two and thirty thou&s;and pounds, which the late king had re&s;erved for the maintenance of one hundred and forty knights, who had undertaken to carry his heart to Jeru&s;alem; and indeed his attachment to this foreigner &s;eemed to glow with all the ardor of a pa&s;&s;ionate admirer. Had Edward been a woman, &s;uch raptures would have been natural; for Gave&s;ton po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every per&s;onal accompli&s;hment. Actuated by the coun&s;els of this minion$ he removed from their offices the chancellor, trea&s;urer, judges, and baron$ of the exchequer, and filled their places with his creatures. Langton bi&s;hop of L$tchfield was impri&s;oned, and the temporalities of his &s;ee were &s;equ$$$red, until an enquiry could be made into his conduct and management as trea&s;urer to the late king; while P$$rs Gave&s;ton was appointed great cham|berlain, &s;ecretary of &s;tat$, and governed the whole kingdom as prime m$|ni&s;ter.</P>

<P>A parliament was &s;ummoned at Northampton, to regulate the late king's funeral, together with the marriage and coronation of the reigning prince, as well as to deliberate upon the &s;tate of the realm. A &s;ub&s;idy w$$ granted to defray the expence of the$e articles; and it was enacted that th$ adulterated coin, which would not pa&s;s in the la&s;t reign$ &s;hould now be current all over the kingdom.

to con&s;ummate his nuptials with the prince&s;s I&s;abel, he appointed Gave$$on guar|dian of the realm in his ab&s;ence, with power to grant cong&eacute;s d'elire for mini|&s;ters of cathedral and conventual churches; to take the oath from prelates at their elections; to re&s;tore temporalities; di&s;po&s;e of prebendaries and benefices that were in the gift of the crown; and be&s;tow ward&s;hips that might happen to fall while the king &s;hould be abroad.

After having fea&s;ted &s;ome days<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>The nation hoped that this marriage would have weaned the king from his affection to Gave&s;ton, or at lea&s;t divided his attention; but his love for that minion &s;eemed daily to encrea&s;e. He be&s;towed upon him all the &s;umptuous pre&s;ents he had received from his father-in-law; affected to call him brother; care&s;&s;ed him as if he had been a mi&s;tre&s;s; and publi&s;hed a pro|clamation enjoining all per&s;ons to call him earl of Cornwal. Piers could not bear this favour with moderation: intoxicated with power, he became proud and in&s;olent, and affected to treat the Engli&s;h nobility with &s;corn an$ deri&s;ion: the queen her&s;elf was not exempted from his ridicule and &s;lights. He was &s;o enamoured of his own qualities, that he payed no regard to tho&s;e of other people. He held tournaments, in which he was always victorious. He af|fected not only to out&s;hine the nobles of the land, but even to eclip&s;e his &s;ove|reign; and appeared with &s;uch fa&s;tidious pomp at the coronation, carrying the imperial crown, that one of the earls could hardly be prevented from &s;acrificing him to his re&s;entment. The nobility had &s;ignified to the king that they would not attend at the ceremony until Gave&s;ton &s;hould be bani&s;hed the kingdom; but he prevailed upon them to alter that re&s;olution, with a promi&s;e to grant their reque&s;t in the next parliament. In the interval, between the coronation and that a&s;&s;embly, Edward in vain tampered with individuals, in hope of making a &s;trong party in favour of his darling; and mi&s;carrying in all his at|tempts, began to fortify his towns and ca&s;tles, as if he meant to &s;et his &s;ub|jects at defiance. The nobility followed his example; and every thing &s;eemed to pre&s;age a civil war. At the parliament they appeared in arms, and renewed their in&s;tances for the bani&s;hment of Gave&s;ton. Some per&s;ons of moderation dreading the pro&s;pect of national calamities, interpo&s;ed their good offices to mediate an accommodation: but the barons &s;till in&s;i&s;ted upon the expul&s;ion of Gave&s;ton, though they con&s;ented to his enjoying his whole e&s;tate. They de|manded that he &s;hould abjure the realm before Mid&s;ummer; and the bi&s;hops denounced him excommunicated &s;hould he continue longer in the i&s;land. Ed|ward was obliged, though with un&s;peakable reluctance, to give up the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his confident; but, in order to con&s;ole him for his misfortune, he granted the honours of the High Pec, and Cockermouth, with &s;everal man$urs and
<PB N="634" REF="6430">
ca&s;tles, to him and his counte&s;s, and their heirs for ever. He likewi&s;e indulged him with the grant of a large e&s;tate in Ga&s;cony; and that his exile might &s;it as ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible upon him, he appointed him lord lieutenant of Ireland; a&s;&s;igned the whole revenue of that kingdom for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and convoyed him in per&s;on to Bri&s;tol. As he fore&s;aw that the&s;e &s;teps would give umbrage to the barons, he employed all his indu&s;try in gaining over a majority to his intere&s;t, by care&s;&s;es and acts of favour; and ordered, by proclamation, that none &s;hould appear armed at the en&s;uing parliament. The earls of Lincoln and Surrey being mollified by the king's conce&s;&s;ions and intreaties, de&s;i&s;ted from the per&s;ecution of Gave&s;ton; and the whole a&s;&s;ociation, except Guy earl of Warwick, laid a&s;ide their re&s;entment.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

The king &s;ollicited Clement to relea&s;e him from this re&s;triction; but his im|patience being too keen to brook the delay of the pope's an&s;wer, he recalled Gave&s;ton, and went as far as Che&s;ter to receive him in his return from Ireland. Then he expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch tran&s;ports at their meeting, that the people did not &s;cruple to &s;ay he was bewitched; and conveyed him to Langley in Hertford|&s;hire, where he enjoyed him for &s;ome time, without being interrupted by his<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mo$. M$lm. $$mer. $word$.</NOTE> queen or mini&s;ters. The barons being di&s;united in their councils, were obliged to &s;tifle their indignation at this &s;hameful pa&s;&s;ion of Edward, who, at the next parliament a&s;&s;embled at Stamford, prevailed upon the nobility to con&s;ent that his paramour &s;hould remain in England without mole&s;tation. He was &s;o well plea&s;ed with this in&s;tance of their conde&s;cen&s;ion, that he &s;quandered away great &s;ums of money upon balls, tournaments, and other public diver&s;ions, in which Gave&s;ton might have an opportunity to di&s;play his accompli&s;hments: but none of the barons appeared at the&s;e rejoicings; and the li&s;ts being inclo&s;ed at Ke|n$ngton for a tournament, the pillars were taken away, and the inclo&s;ure broken down in the night, by per&s;ons unknown. Gave&s;ton, whom no le&s;&s;on of ad|ver&s;ity could improve, re&s;umed all his in&s;olence and prodigality; and with a view to &s;ecure a &s;trong party in his favour, dive&s;ted a great number of people of their places, and be&s;towed them upon his own adherents. By which means he entailed upon him&s;elf the implacable hatred of all tho&s;e whom he had de|prived of their employments, without adding to the &s;trength of his own inte|re&s;t. This conduct revived the animo&s;ity of the whole nation: the nobles were &s;hocked at his pre&s;umption; and the earl of Lanca&s;ter vowed revenge again&s;t him for &s;ome private injury he had &s;u&s;tained at his hands. He &s;eemed to laugh at their di&s;&s;atisfaction; expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t contempt for the re&s;ent|ment<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. W$&s;t. Mon.

<P>The earls were more incen&s;ed at the&s;e per&s;onal indignities, than at any circum&s;tance of his public admini&s;tration. They renewed their con&s;ultations, and endeavoured to re-unite their party for his de&s;truction. With this view they appointed &s;everal tournaments &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, that their parti&s;ans might have an opportunity to a&s;&s;emble; but all the&s;e meetings were prohibited by procla|mation. The king convoked a parliament at York; but no bu&s;ine&s;s was tran&s;acted, becau&s;e the earls did not a&s;&s;i&s;t at the &s;e&s;&s;ion. Another was &s;um|moned
<PB N="635" REF="6440">
to meet at the &s;ame place; and as they &s;till declined appearing, on pre|tence of dreading Gave&s;ton's treachery, he de&s;ired his favourite to withdraw, and adjourned the parliament to We&s;tmin&s;ter. Being apprehen&s;ive of &s;ome violence, he i&s;&s;ued particular writs to the earls of Lanca&s;ter, Hereford, Pem|broke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1310.</NOTE> and Warwick, forbidding them to come armed to parliament; and the earls of Glouce&s;ter, Lincoln, Surrey, and Richmond, undertook for their &s;afe-conduct. Neverthele&s;s, the di&s;contented noblemen and barons appeared with numerous retinues, and re&s;olved to compel the king to redre&s;s the grie|vances of the nation. Edward, in order to &s;upply the nece&s;&s;ities of his hou&s;e|hold, had taken pri&s;e and purveyance, or in other words, plundered the &s;ub|jects of their merchandi&s;e, contrary to the expre&s;s law which had been enacted in his father's reign; and this exertion of arbitrary power furni&s;hed the barons with a popular &s;ubject of complaint. They repre&s;ented the damages &s;u&s;tained by the merchants who&s;e effects had been &s;eized: they expatiated upon the mi&s;eries of the kingdom, impoveri&s;hed by the prodigality of the king, and hara&s;&s;ed by &s;uch oppre&s;ive mea&s;ures: they drew a compari&s;on between the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of the kingdom in his father's time, and the con|temptible condition to which it was then reduced: they imputed this di&s;ho|nourable change to want of oeconomy and evil coun&s;els; and in&s;i&s;ted upon the king's empowering them to elect twelve per&s;ons authorized to make ordinances for regulating his hou&s;hold, and &s;ettling the affairs of the nation. At fir&s;t he &s;crupled to comply with this demand; but, as they were determined to carry their point, and threatened to proceed to extremities, he thought proper to &s;ubmit, and i&s;&s;ued a commi&s;&s;ion empowering the prelates, earls, and barons, to chu&s;e proper per&s;ons for making tho&s;e ordinances. Yet the power of electing the ordainers was not ve&s;ted in the whole parliament, but in eleven bi&s;hops, eight earls, and thirteen barons, who declared, in an authentic in&s;trument, that this grant proceeded entirely from the king's own free will, and &s;hould not be drawn into a precedent to the prejudice of his maje&s;ty, his heirs, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; and that their commi&s;&s;ions &s;hould expire at Michaelmas in the following year. This in&s;trument being &s;igned and ratified, the ordainers were cho&s;en, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ryley.

<P>Edward having thus reconciled him&s;elf to his &s;ubjects, re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute the war with Scotland, in which his intere&s;t was by this time almo&s;t totally decayed. Robert de Brus, who was perhaps the greate&s;t prince of his time, and ju&s;tly &s;tiled the re&s;torer of the Scotti&s;h monarchy, had been pre|vented from taking immediate advantage of the late king's death by a violent di&s;temper, which reduced him to extremity: and had young Edward improved this opportunity, he might have with great ea&s;e executed the de&s;ign which his father had projected; but his &s;udden return freed the Scots in a great mea&s;ure from that terror and perplexity under which they laboured. At his departure from Scotland, he left his forces under the command of John Cumin, the mo&s;t powerful of all the Scotti&s;h nobility, whom he knew to be the inveterate enemy of Bruce and his adherents. He was joined by a &s;trong reinforcement of his
<PB N="636" REF="6450">
countrymen, commanded by Mowbr$y; and as Bruce h$$ $ade great progre&s;s in the north before he was &s;eized with his $span$ marched again&s;t him at the head of a &s;trong army. They found him, $span$ &s;o advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted, that they dur&s;t not venture an attack; $span$ they could not retreat without giving him an oppor$unity of falling upon $word$ rear, they were fain to &s;ue for a truce, which he readily granted, $word$ his own men were raw$ undi&s;cip$ined, and ill armed, and gre$tly infer$or in number to his adver&s;aries. It was immediately after this tran&s;action that he was taken ill; and the news of his di&s;temper reaching Cumin, this nobleman re&s;olved to draw the Bru&s;&s;ian forces into an engag$ment, where they could not avail them&s;elves of the con|duct, nor be animated by the pre&s;ence of their leader. He accordingly marched to Inverury$ where they were encamped; and Robert being informed of his de&s;ign, ordered his a$$end$n$s to carry him into the field, where his army was drawn up under his eye, and by his immediate direction. Then he was &s;et upon hor&s;eback, &s;upported by two dome&s;tics, and conveyed to the front of the line, where he continued to direct the battle. His people fought with &s;uch alacrity in pre&s;ence of their beloved prince, that Cumin and Mowbray were &s;oon defeated; and the &s;atisfaction produced from this &s;ucce&s;s in all probability contributed to the recovery of the victor. He now &s;urprized the ca&s;tle of In|verne&s;s, over-ran Murray, from whence he drove the earl of Buchan before him; then entering Angus, reduced the ca&s;tles of Brechin and Forfar, and &s;ub|dued the whole country to the northward of the&s;e fortre&s;&s;es. Donald of the i&s;les, and John lord of Argyle, being the mo&s;t powerful enemies he had now to encount$r in his own country, he detached his brother Edward with a body of troops to reduce the fir&s;t, and he him&s;elf marched again&s;t the other. The &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s attended both expeditions. Donald was routed and taken, and John was defeated and obliged to retire into England. By the&s;e victories Brus became ma&s;ter of the we&s;tern coa&s;ts, and was enabled to equip a fleet of &s;hips for the protection of the i&s;les which he had conquered. Having reduced all Scotland to his obedience, he made incur&s;ions into Northumberland, where he ravaged the country without oppo&s;ition; Edward being &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the di&s;&s;$tisfaction of the nobility, and emptine$s of his exchequer, that he could no$ defend his dominions from this invader.</P>

<P>While he was thus re&s;tricted and hampered by his own &s;ubjects, as well as by the enemy, he li&s;tened to the &s;ugge&s;tions of his father-in-law the French king, who propo&s;ed a truce with the Scots, which was accordingly concluded by the negotiation of the earl of Glouce&s;ter and two papal nuncio$. This was a very convenient ce&s;&s;ation for Robert de Brus, who now found lei|$$re to e&s;tabli&s;h a regular form of government, and conciliate the affection of the nobility, who had been hitherto aver&s;e to his intere&s;t. After &s;uch repeated proofs of his valour and &s;agacity, the majority of tho&s;e who had formerly op|po&s;ed him were now inclined to acknowlege the deliverer of their country; and<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> his title was recognized in a full convention of the e&s;tates. What con&s;iderably tended to the confirmation of his authority, was an amba&s;&s;ador &s;ent to him in the per&s;on of Oliver des Roches, who pa&s;&s;ed through England by virtue of a &s;afe-conduct granted by Edward. He hoped that a &s;peedy peace would be the re&s;ult of the negociation: but the &s;ucce&s;s of his endeavours was prevent$d by the $$ro$ity of the S$ots, who renewed their incur&s;ions on the Engli&s;h bor|$$r without any regard to the truce; and Edward &s;ummoned his military te|na$t$
<PB N="637" REF="6460">
to meet him at Newca&s;tle upon Tyne by Michaelmas, that he might cha&s;ti&s;e the Scots for having violated the convention. The di&s;contented barons refu&s;ing to attend at the rendezvous, the expedition was laid a&s;ide, and the truce renewed: but the Scots recommencing ho&s;tilities, the king &s;ent for Richard de Burgh earl of Ul&s;ter, and a body of forces from Ireland; ordered a fleet to &s;ail towards the mouth of the Tay, for the &s;ecurity of Perth, which was &s;till in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and appointed another rendezvous at Berwick. Tho' the earls of Lanca&s;ter, Pembroke, Warwick, and Hereford, excu&s;ed them|&s;elves from going thither, on account of the ordinances about which the com|mittee was employed at London, Edward re&s;olved to proceed with his enter|prize; and entering Scotland, advanced as far as Linlithgow, without &s;eeing the face of an enemy. The &s;oldiers of Robert de Brus were not yet &s;ufficiently trained for a pitched battle; and therefore he retired before the Engli&s;h army, after having removed every thing that could &s;erve them for forage or &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence. He did not fail, however, to pour down from the mountains oc|ca&s;ionally, upon detached parties of the enemy, which he generally interrupted and de&s;troyed: &s;o that Edward &s;eeing his forces in&s;en&s;ibly dimini&s;h, and begin|ning to be in great want of provi&s;ion, retreated to Berwick, where he pa&s;&s;ed the winter.</P>

<P>He now gave directions for fortifying all his ca&s;tles in Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Piers penetrated beyond the frith of Forth; but, as he could not draw the Scots to a general engagement, he did not perform any con&s;iderable &s;ervice. When he returned to Berwick, the king &s;et out for Lon|don, where he had &s;ummoned a parliament to meet on the eighth day of Au|gu&s;t, that they might confirm the new ordinances. The&s;e were accordingly delivered to his council, and found &s;o injurious to the royal dignity, that Ed|ward at fir&s;t rejected &s;everal articles as contrary to the nature of the commi&s;&s;ion, by which they were re&s;tricted from doing any thing to his prejudice. The committee were as tenacious of every particular; and the king, in order to prevent mi&s;chief, at length gave his a&s;&s;ent, after having prote&s;ted, that if any article contained in tho&s;e ordinances &s;hould be found prejudicial to the king, or unauthorize$ by his commi&s;&s;ion, it &s;hould be deemed null and non-confirmed; and he re&s;erved to him&s;elf a power of correcting and reforming the articles, by the advice of the ordainers and others. The&s;e ordinances being peru&s;ed and approved by the parliament, the lords and commons, as well as the mayor and aldermen of London, bound them&s;elves by oath to ob&s;erve them: towards the latter end of September, they were publi&s;hed by the prelates, earls, and barons, in St. Paul's church-yard, and next day in the cathedral by the king's council. They provided that the church &s;hould enjoy her franchi&s;es; and the two charters be pre&s;erved: that the cu&s;toms &s;hould be collected by natives, and be payed into the exchequer: that Frenobalde and his partners$ by whom they had been hitherto farmed, &s;hould account for their receipts within a certain time, on pain of being arre&s;ted, and treated as enemies to the public: that no prizes &s;hould be taken by the king's officers without the owner's con|&s;ent: that the cu&s;tom or duty upon wine &s;hould be no longer collected: that the juri&s;di$tion of the mare&s;chal of the king's court &s;hould be limited to cau&s;e$ concerning the &s;ervants or officers of the hou&s;hold, or &s;uch as lived within the

To part with his darling Gave&s;ton was like tearing the &s;oul from the body; yet he was obliged to comply with that cruel clau&s;e, and perhaps he thought this &s;acrifice would prevail upon the parliament to mitigate the other articles at their next meeting: he was di&s;appointed in his expectation. The earls of Glouce&s;ter, Lanca&s;ter, Hereford, Pembroke, Warwick, and Arundel, appeared in arms with numerous retinues, and loudly complained that Ga|ve&s;ton &s;till lurked in Cornwal, or &s;ome of the we&s;tern counties.

The barons immediately took the alarm, and rai&s;ed a clamour over the whole nation.

That they might have no room to doubt his &s;incerity, he empowered the bi&s;hop of Norwich and others, to treat with the ordainers about correcting tho&s;e articles that were injurious to the crown, and contrary to the nature of the commi&s;&s;ion by virtue of which they had been enacted: but the di&s;contented party, though then a&s;&s;embled at London, refu&s;ed to treat upon the &s;ubject in the king's ab&s;ence; yet they profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves ready to treat with him in per&s;on, and comply with every $ea&s;onable demand for his &s;atisfaction. This, however, was no more than a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ryley$</NOTE> &s;hew of moderation; for by this time they had re&s;olved to humble the power of the crown, and for that purpo&s;e &s;ome of them are &s;aid to have favoured the progre&s;s of Robert de Brus in Scotland. They had certainly exceeded their com|mi&s;&s;ion in framing the ordinances, and in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;ome that were altogether uncon&s;titutional; but, as they knew their own &s;trength, they were determined to u&s;e it to the be&s;t advantage. Though the great offices of the crown were no longer in his di&s;po&s;al, yet even by the ordinances he was allowed to fill up the vacancies for the time being, till the meeting of the parliament; and by virtue of this power, he be&s;towed the po&s;t of trea&s;urer during that interval upon Walter bi&s;hop of Litchfield, whom he had formerly per&s;ecuted. After a &s;trict inqui&s;ition into his conduct, he had been found innocent and admitted into favour. While he was a pri&s;oner, the earls of the oppo&s;ition had inter|ceded in his behalf; but, now that he was re&s;tored to his former office, they took umbrage at his promotion. The earls of Pembroke and Hereford, at|tended by a number of $word$ entered the exchequer, where he $at for the di&s;patch of bu&s;ine&s;s, and a&s;ked whether or not he had taken an oath for ob&s;$$$$ng

<P>The di&s;contented ea$ls, joined by John de Warenne earl of Surry, whom they had found means to detach from the king's intere&s;t, having con|cer$$d mea&s;ures for accompli&s;hing their aim, began with a demand that Ga|ve&s;ton &s;hould either be delivered into their hands, or bani&s;hed the kingdom w$$$out del$y. The king refu&s;ing to comply with their addre&s;s, the arch|bi$hop thundered out the &s;entence o$ excommunication again&s;t the favourite; $word$ the barons re&s;olved to take arms, under the command of the earl of $word$ whom they cho&s;e for their general. Having a&s;&s;embled a number of $orces at different parts, on pretence of holding tournaments, they &s;uddenly united all their bodies, &s;o as to compo&s;e a numerous army, and began their march for Newca&s;tle, where the king re&s;ided, in full confidence of receiving a r$$$forcement of Ga&s;cons, before the barons would proceed to extremity. His &s;ecurity, however, was &s;o ill founded, that the earl of Lanca&s;ter had reached within a few miles of Newca&s;tle, before he had the lea&s;t intimation of his approach; &s;o that he was fain to retire with precipitation to Tinmouth, where he embarked with his retinue. He &s;et Gave&s;ton a&s;hore at the ca&s;tle of Scarborough, one of the &s;tronge&s;t fortre&s;&s;es in England, and he him&s;elf landed<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$mer. M$$. M$$$&s;.</NOTE> at Knare&s;borough; from whence he proceeded to York. The general of the barons no &s;ooner under&s;tood the place of Gave&s;ton's retreat, than he detached the earls of Surrey and Pembroke, Henry de Percy, and Robert de Clifford, with a body of forces to inve&s;t Scarborough, while he took po&s;t between that place and York, to cut off all communication between the king and his fa|vourite. Edward &s;ent orders to the barons to rai&s;e the &s;iege; but the&s;e were &s;$ighted, and the operations carried on with redoubled $igour. Gave&s;ton &s;tood &s;everal a&s;&s;aults; but &s;eeing no pro&s;pect of relief, and afraid of exa&s;perating the be&s;iegers by an ob&s;tinate defence, he de&s;ired to capitulate, and &s;urrendered him&s;elf to Aymer de Valence earl of Pembroke, on condition of being kept in &s;afe cu&s;tody till the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t; and in ca&s;e he &s;hould not con&s;ent to the re&s;olutions which the earls might take concerning his per&s;on, before that time, he &s;hould be re&s;tored to the &s;tate in which they found him, and put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ca&s;tle which he now re&s;igned. The king advi&s;ed him to comply with the&s;e terms, in hope of being able to rai&s;e an army for his relief; and the earl of Pembroke, with Henry de Percy, obliged them&s;elves to perform the ar|ticles, on pain of forfeiting all their lands and tenements. Aymer propo&s;ed to convey the pri&s;oner to his own ca&s;tle of Wallingford; but left him at Deding|ton in Oxfor$&s;hire, on pretence of pa&s;&s;ing a night with his lady, who re|&s;ided in the neighbourhood. Guy earl of Warwick having rai&s;ed the po&s;&s;e con$$tatus, be&s;et the hou&s;e in which Gave&s;ton lodged, and his guards refu&s;ing t$ de$$nd him again&s;t &s;uch a powerful aggre&s;&s;or, he was carried to the ca&s;tle of $word$ Thither the earls of Lanca&s;ter, Hereford, and Arundel, repaired $word$ $$$d a con&s;ultation about the pri&s;oner; and it being re&s;olved to put him to
<PB N="641" REF="6500">
death, as an enemy to the kingdom, he was conveyed to a place called Black|low-hill, now Gayer&s;ike, and beheaded by a Wel&s;hman provided for that pur|po&s;e. Lanca&s;ter is &s;aid to have viewed the head, when &s;evered from the body, with marks of barbarous triumph: and indeed the whole of this &s;cene was acted with cruelty and perfidiou&s;ne&s;s; for if Gave&s;ton was actually guilty of the crimes laid to his charge, he ought to have been fairly tried by the laws of his country. The body of this unfortunate nobleman was carried to the con|vent of the Dominican Friars at Oxford, where it lay unburied on account of the &s;entence of excommunication under which he died; but it was afterwards &s;umptuou&s;ly interred at Langley in Hertford&s;hire. The earl of Pembroke<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dugdale.</NOTE> being &s;u&s;pected of collu&s;ion with tho&s;e who deprived Gave&s;ton of his life, complained loudly of the injury he had &s;u&s;tained; and going to the earl of Glouce&s;ter, begged that nobleman's a&s;&s;i&s;tance in vindicating his honour, and &s;aving his lands from being forfeited. He expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the &s;ame pur|po&s;e in a convocation of the univer&s;ity of Oxford, and afterwards renounced the cau&s;e of the confederate barons. The king admitted his apologies, and gladly received him into his &s;ervice; but as Henry de Percy did not appear at court, he was reputed guilty: his lands were forfeited according to the te|nour of the bond he had given, and an order was i&s;&s;ued for apprehending his per&s;on.</P>

<P>The king had, upon Gave&s;ton's capitulation, quitted York, and pro|ceeded as far north as Berwick, where he received the tidings of his favourite's death. The tran&s;ports of his grief on this occa&s;ion were &s;uch as might have been expected from the extravagance of pa&s;&s;ion he had always expre&s;&s;ed for Gave&s;ton. He underwent the mo&s;t violent agitations, which might have en|dangered his life, if he had not found means to oppo&s;e his &s;orrow with his re|&s;entment. His grief was not &s;ilent and de&s;ponding, but loud and impetuous. He denounced vengeance again&s;t the murderers of his minion, and &s;et out immediately for London, where he was per&s;uaded by the earl of Pembroke, Hugh le D'E&s;pen&s;er, the lords Beaumont and Mauley, to levy forces and re|venge &s;uch a flagrant in&s;ult upon his royal authority. He &s;ummoned a par|liament to meet in Augu&s;t, repaired to Dover, where he fortified the ca&s;tle, re|ceived the oath of allegiance from the barons of the Cinque-Ports, demanded &s;uccours from France, and returning to London, a&s;&s;embled a con&s;iderable body of forces. He at the &s;ame time &s;ummoned all who were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mon. Malm.</NOTE> of forty pounds in land, to come and receive the honour of knighthood; and appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to treat about the ordinances at the en&s;uing parliament. The malecontents, however, paid no regard to the &s;ummons they had received; and, as they did not appear at the day appointed, orders were i&s;&s;ued, forbidding them to rai&s;e forces, and prohibiting all others from joining in their rebellious mea&s;ures. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e orders, the barons proclaimed tournaments in different counties, and levied &s;uch a number of troops as exceeded the king's army. At the head of the&s;e the earl of Lanca&s;ter advanced towards London; and a civil war mu&s;t have nece&s;&s;arily en&s;ued, had not the earls of Glouce&s;ter and Richmond, together wi$h the French amba&s;&s;ador and pope's nuncio, inter|po&s;ed their good offices to prevent &s;uch a dreadful calamity. By their media|tion a treaty was &s;et on foot, and a &s;afe-conduct granted to the earl of Hereford, and the lords $word$ and Botetourt, that they might come to court and treat about an accommodation. As th$&s;e deputies proceeded very &s;lowly in their
<PB N="$42" REF="6510">
d$$berations, the earl of Lanca&s;ter was furni&s;hed with a &s;afe-conduct; and the queen being delivered of her elde&s;t &s;on Edward at Wind&s;or, the king was &s;o overjoyed at this event, that he &s;eemed to have forgot the lo&s;s of Gave&s;ton, and &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the barons, importing that he would con&s;ent to any thing they could a&s;k in rea&s;on. They demanded a confirmation of all the or|dinances without exception; and a full pardon for the death of Gave&s;ton, whom they branded with the name of a traitor. Edward at fir&s;t rejected this condition; but at length the treaty was concluded on the&s;e terms: that the barons &s;hould come before the king in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, and a&s;k pardon on their knees: that they &s;hould re&s;tore the effects of Gave&s;ton which they had &s;eized at Newca&s;tle: that they and their adherents &s;hould have a full pardon, under the &s;anction of parliament, for the death of Gave&s;ton, and the ho&s;tilities they had committed again&s;t the king; and that a like pardon &s;hould be granted to the friends and adherents of that unhappy favourite: that a provi&s;ion &s;hould be made in parliament for preventing the barons from coming to &s;uch a&s;&s;emblies in arms, with a great number of followers, &s;o as to endanger the peace of the $word$ that immediately after the pacification a rea&s;onable &s;ub&s;idy &s;hould be granted for the maintenance of the war in Scotland; and that Henry de<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> P$r$y &s;hould be re&s;tored to his honours and e&s;tate.</P>

<P>In the cour&s;e of this year was held the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of the council of $word$ where Philip the Fair appeared in per&s;on, with three of his &s;ons, and his brother Charles de Valois. Pope Clement gave the a&s;&s;embly to under&s;tand that he had convened them to con&s;ult about the recovery of the Holy Land, and the fate of the Templars, who had been &s;eized and impri&s;oned all over Europe, in con&s;equence of being charged with crimes of the mo&s;t attrocious nature. In all probability, their great power and immen&s;e wealth excited the jealou&s;y and envy of the European princes; for by this time they enjoyed &s;ixteen thou|&s;and lord&s;hips in Chri&s;tendom. Such a &s;ociety, independent of all govern|ments, though their influence extended through every kingdom of Europe, could not but alarm every prince of &s;ound policy, e&s;pecially as the order gained ground every day, and increa&s;ed their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions either by purcha&s;e or bene|$$$$ion. Philip the Fair dreading the progre&s;s of their power, and allured by the hope of &s;haring their acqui&s;itions, found means to trump up an accu&s;ation again&s;t the whole order, containing &s;uch articles as intailed upon them the de|te&s;tation and abhorrence of mankind. Two infamous per&s;ons who had been expelled from the order, impeached them of renouncing Chri&s;t at their ad|mi&s;&s;ion, of &s;pitting and trampling upon the cro&s;s, and wor&s;hipping a wooden head with a large beard. They were likewi&s;e accu&s;ed of certain unnatural crimes, which it would be indecent to de&s;cribe; and their pride, in&s;olence, and voluptuous manner of living had rendered them &s;o odious to the world in general, that no power or advocate of con&s;equence would undertake their defence. Upon the information of tho&s;e two evidences, Philip ordered all the Templars in his dominions to be &s;eized in one day, and all their e&s;tates to be confi&s;cated. He then tampered with the mo&s;t di&s;&s;olute among the pri&s;oners, and chiefly by threats intimidated them into &s;uch a confe&s;&s;ion as would an&s;wer his purpo&s;e. He is even &s;aid to have forged confe&s;&s;ions, and to have fraudu|lently obtained the &s;ignature of the great ma&s;ter and other chiefs of the order, who being &s;o illiterate that they could neither read nor write, &s;et their marks to a paper which they were told was no more than an acknowledgment of &s;ome
<PB N="643" REF="6520">
trifling irregularities; whereas it was a full confe&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t enormous crimes. When this was afterwards read in their hearing, before the pope's commi&s;&s;aries, they were &s;eized with horror and indignation, and loudly di&s;|claimed the paper as a vile impo&s;ition. This declaration was deemed apo&s;ta&s;y$ and above three&s;core were publicly burned, profe&s;&s;ing their innocence to the la&s;t moment of their lives. Edward hearing of the&s;e proceedings, had writ in their favour to the pope, and the king of Ca&s;tile, Arragon, and Sicily; but his holine&s;s, with whom the king of France had concerted the de&s;truction of the order, &s;ent a letter to the king of England, de&s;iring that all the Knights-Templars of England and Ireland &s;hould be apprehended, and all their e&s;tates &s;eque&s;tred in both kingdoms. Edward complied with his reque&s;t, and the pope &s;ent over two commi&s;&s;aries to enquire into the crimes laid to their charge: examinations were taken in different parts of the realm; but nothing appeared again&s;t them which could ju&s;tify the di&s;&s;olution of their order. Archbi&s;hop Winchel&s;ey convened a provincial &s;ynod at London, in order to determine this affair, but the members could not be per&s;uaded to condemn them, or publi&s;h the pope's excommunication, according to the direction of his holine&s;s, in ca&s;e they &s;hould be found guilty. The archbi&s;hop being in ha&s;te to &s;et out for the council of Vienne, left the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the charge of here&s;y to Robert de Pykering, his vicar-general, who called a new convocation, and producing the extorted confe&s;&s;ions of &s;eventy-two Templars who were burned at Paris, the clergy were prevailed upon to pa&s;s a cen&s;ure again&s;t the knights as heretics. Each Templar was ordered to abjure all here&s;y; confe&s;s that he was rendered in|famous by the pope's bull, and &s;ubmit him&s;elf to the grace of God, and the ordinance of the council. In the very fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of this a&s;&s;embly, pope Cle|ment, in pre&s;ence of the kings of France and Navarre, having prohibited all per&s;ons, on pain of the greater excommunication, from &s;peaking one word in that council without his permi&s;&s;ion, declared the order of Templars di&s;&s;olved, by the plenitude of his power; and that he re&s;erved their lands and effects to his own di&s;po&s;al. The&s;e he afterwards granted to the Knights-Ho&s;pitallers, who had lately taken the i&s;le of Rhodes, and done great &s;ervice again&s;t the in|fidels. Two cardinals were &s;ent to &s;ee this bull executed in England; and the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hemi$$$o$d. Cont. B$ro$.</NOTE> knights of the Ho&s;pital petitioned, by their procurators, that they might be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the lands which had belonged to the other order; but the king deferred his an&s;wer until he could con&s;ult with his nobility. The barons<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 131$.</NOTE> had already &s;eized all the lands which their ance&s;tors had granted to the Tem|plars, alledging that the&s;e lands of right reverted to them as heirs of the foun|ders, on the di&s;&s;olution of the order; and ten years elap&s;ed before they were prevailed upon to cede them to the Ho&s;pitallers. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>While Edward was embroiled with his barons in England, Robert de Brus executed his projects without oppo&s;ition. He reduced the fortre&s;&s;es of Bute, Dumfries, and other ca&s;tles in Scotland, and ravaged the Engli&s;h bor|der, from whence he carried off great booty. During the &s;ucceeding winter, he took Perth by a&s;&s;ault; Sir James Douglas &s;urprized Roxburgh, and the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh was taken by Thomas Randolph earl of Murray. Robert having thus made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of all the &s;trengths in the kingdom, except Stirling, Dunbar, and Berwick, ordered his brother Edward to inve&s;t the fir&s;t of the&s;e; and he attempted to &s;urprize the latter, but mi&s;carried through the barking of a dog, which alarmed the garri&s;on. A treaty had been &s;et on foot
<PB N="644" REF="6530">
between Edward and Robert, by the mediation of the French king; but, be|fore he could be brought to an accommodation, Edward, who was intent upon being pre&s;ent at the knighthood and coronation of his queen's brother Lewis king of Navarre, &s;et out for Paris, leaving the negotiation with the Scotti&s;h king unfini&s;hed, and the whole oeconomy of his kingdom un&s;ettled and in&s;e|cure. During his re&s;idence at the court of France, he &s;ent over a commi&s;&s;ion for the bi&s;hops of Bath and Worce&s;ter, the earls of Glouce&s;ter and Richmond, to hold a parliament in July to confirm the acts of pardon and &s;ecurity$ but the great lords thinking them&s;elves &s;lighted by his ab&s;ence, returned to their own homes; and though he found the parliament &s;itting, at his return, no bu&s;ine&s;s was tran&s;acted, becau&s;e the earls upon who&s;e account it had been con|vened were withdrawn. He expected a &s;upply, but being di&s;appointed in that hope, di&s;&s;olved the a&s;&s;embly, and borrowed &s;ums of money from the bi&s;hops and abbots, to rai&s;e a body of forces again&s;t the Scots, who threatened the<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> kingdom with an inva&s;ion. The great lords attending at the next parliament, were graciou&s;ly received by the king, and a&s;&s;ured of a perfect reconciliation; the a$$s of pardon and &s;ecurity were pa&s;&s;ed and publi&s;hed; particular pardons under the great &s;eal were granted to the earls of Lanca&s;ter, Hereford, and Warwick$ and near five hundred of their adherents by name; and the barons gave their a&s;&s;ent to an ordinance, declaring it was part of the royal prerogative to prohibit all per&s;ons from coming in arms to parliament. In this &s;ea&s;on of good humour$ they voted a con&s;iderable &s;ub&s;idy to enable the king to maintain the war in Scotland$ where the natives that &s;till adhered to his intere&s;t were hard pr$&s;&s;$d by the Bru&s;&s;$ans, and had &s;ent Patrick earl of Marche, and Adam Gordon, to &s;ollicit immediate &s;uccours. Edward had already formed the re|&s;olution of marching to their relief, and rai&s;ed a con&s;iderable &s;um of money by mortgaging the revenues of Guienne to the pope. But all the&s;e funds being in&s;ufficient to defray the expence of the meditated enterprize, he bor|rowed two thou&s;and marks of cardinal Te&s;$a; and &s;ent briefs to almo&s;t all the individual eccle&s;ia&s;tics of England, requiring from each a &s;um proportioned to his abilities. He had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the Scotti&s;h deputies, with a&s;&s;urances of being at Berwick with all his forces by the fea&s;t of St. John the Bapti&s;t, and began to make mighty preparations for humbling Brus, who had by this time civi|lized has &s;ubjects, formed an excellent army, and reduced the i&s;le of Man to his obedience. His brother Edward had inve&s;ted Stirling, which was natu|rally &s;trong$ and &s;o gallantly defended by Mowbray, that after divers a&s;|&s;aults, in which the be&s;iegers were always repul&s;ed with great lo&s;s, both &s;ides agreed to a ce&s;&s;ation of arms for one year; at the expiration of which the ca&s;tle &s;hould be &s;urrendered, if not relieved before that time by the Engli&s;h. King Edward, in the mid&s;t of all his preparations, &s;ailed from Dover to Boulogne; though the cau&s;e of this extraordinary voyage is altogether unknown, and re|turning in a few days, i&s;&s;ued writs requiring his military tenants to meet him<NOTE PLACE="marg">$$mer.

<P>As the ordinances were not yet confirmed, a parliament was called for that purpo&s;e in January, when the friends of the king oppo&s;ed them &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly, as articles de&s;tructive of the prerogative, and &s;ubver&s;ive of the con&s;titution, that they were rejected by a majority; and for this rea&s;on the earl of Lanca&s;ter, and the barons of his party, refu&s;ed to attend the king in his expedition. About this period Edward received intelligence that the Scots had
<PB N="645" REF="6540">
made an irruption into England, where they burned Hexham, and &s;everal towns, and not only laid the country under contribution, but compelled the inhabitants to purcha&s;e a truce, on condition that they &s;hould not for the fu|ture oppo&s;e the Scots at any time in their inva&s;ions of England. The king was no &s;ooner apprized of the&s;e tran&s;actions, than he i&s;&s;ued orders to the Cinque-Ports, and maritime towns, to equip their fleet, and be at Berwick on the day of rendezvous. He &s;ent the earl of Pembroke, as guardian of Scotland, to check the progre&s;s of the enemy in the northern counties: he wrote to the earl of Ul&s;ter to rai&s;e the Iri&s;h chieftains, with their va&s;&s;als, and bring them to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance: he ordered new levies to be made in York&s;hire, and other parts of the kingdom; and a&s;&s;embled &s;uch an army as England had never brought into the field upon any former occa&s;ion. The king having kept his Ea&s;ter at Ely, &s;et out for York, and from thence proceeded to Berwick, which he reached about the beginning of June. As the time drew near for the &s;ur|render of Stirling, he began his march immediately for the relief of that fort|re&s;s; and entered Scotland at the head of one hundred thou&s;and fighting men, attended by an incredible number of waggons and camp followers, &s;o as to cover the whole face of the country. They marched without order, as to an a&s;&s;ured victory, and had already parcelled out the lands of the vanqui&s;hed. They were &s;uffered to advance without mole&s;tation from Robert de Brus, who had re&s;olved to hazard a battle; and for that purpo&s;e occupied an advantageous po&s;t in the neighbourhood of Stirling, where he did not doubt of being at|tacked by the Engli&s;h. His army con&s;i&s;ted of thirty thou&s;and cho&s;en men, trained up to war and hard&s;hip under his own eye and example, who were de|termined to conquer or die in defence of their king and country. With the&s;e he took po&s;t on a piece of ground bounded on one &s;ide by a mora&s;s, and on the other by an inacce&s;&s;ible mountain; &s;o that his flanks could not be at|tacked by the enemy's cavalry. A rivulet called Bannockburn ran in his front; and this he had rendered almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able, by digging holes in the bed or channel, in which he fixed &s;harpened &s;takes for the de&s;truction of the Engli&s;h hor&s;e. Large pits were likewi&s;e made between this rivulet and his camp, pro|vided with the &s;ame in&s;truments of annoyance, and artfully covered with turf and boughs to deceive the aggre&s;&s;ors. As the van of Edward's army ap|proached Stirling, under the command of the earls of Glouce&s;ter and Hereford, Henry de Bohun, perceiving a body of Scots at the &s;ide of a wood, ad|vanced again&s;t them with his Wel&s;h followers, and was drawn into an ambu&s;h by Robert de Brus, who &s;allied in per&s;on upon them from a thicket, and riding up to Bohun cleft his &s;kull with a battle$$x. The Engli&s;h being reinforced from their rear, a &s;harp di&s;pute en&s;ued, in which the earl of Glouce&s;ter was di&s;mounted, and the lord Clafford repul&s;ed with con&s;iderable damage. As fre&s;h &s;upplies of men arrived from both armies, in all probability this conflict would have ended in a general engagement, had not night parted the com|batants. The &s;oldiers lay upon their arms, and they, as well as the hor&s;es, were &s;o fatigued with their march, and the want of repo&s;e, that the mo&s;t expe|rienced officers in the army propo&s;ed to defer the attack until the people &s;hould be refre&s;hed. This advice was rejected by the young nobility, who were eager to &s;ignalize their courage; and it was re&s;olved to give battle to the enemy in the morning. The troops were accordingly drawn up in order of battle; the wings, con&s;i&s;ting of cavalry, being commanded by the earls of Glouce&s;ter and

Hereford$ and the king in per&s;on taking his &s;tation in the centre. Robert de Brus formed his army into three lines, and a body of re&s;erve, which was commanded by Douglas and the lord high &s;teward of Scotland. As he had little confidence in his hor&s;e, he ordered the troopers to di&s;mount: he placed his brother Edward at the head of the right wing, Randolph conducted the left, and he him&s;elf commanded the main body. When the Engli&s;h army was on the point of charging, a di&s;pute aro&s;e about the po&s;t of honour, be|tween the earls of Glouce&s;ter and Hereford; and the former, impatient of con|troul, advanced immediately to the charge with great impetuo&s;ity. But their career was &s;oon &s;topped by the hidden pits and trenches into which the hor&s;es tumbled headlong, and were &s;taked in a mi&s;erable manner. This unfore&s;een di&s;|a&s;ter produced the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion; and the Scots taking advantage of their $i&s;or$er, fell upon them &s;word in hand, with &s;uch fury that the greate&s;t part of them was cut in pieces. The earl of Glouce&s;ter's hor&s;e being killed, he fell to the ground, where he was immediately trodden to death; and Sir Giles de Ar|gent$$n &s;eeing him fall, $$rung forward to his re&s;cue: but that gallant officer was &s;lain, together with Robert de Clifford, Payen de Tibetot, and William $word$ While this havock was making in the right wing of cavalry, the $ngli&s;h archers advanced again&s;t the right wing of the enemy, and galled them &s;o effectually with their arrows that they were upon the point of giving ground, when Douglas and the &s;teward, making a wheel with their body of re&s;erve, fell upon the $ank of the Engli&s;h, and routed them with great &s;laughter. Mean while the centre, commanded by Edward, moved on again&s;t the main body of the Scots$ and met with a very warm reception from Robert de Brus, who fought in the front of the line with unequalled valour. The Engli&s;h were already di&s;pirited by the de&s;truction of their wings, and the lo&s;s of their brave&s;t offi|cers$ when the boys, and other followers of the Scotti&s;h camp, who viewed the battle from a neighbouring hill, perceiving the &s;ucce&s;s of Douglas and the &s;teward, began to &s;hout aloud, and run towards the field for the &s;ake of plun|$$r. The Engli&s;h, &s;tartled at their acclamations, and &s;eeing &s;uch a multi|r$de in motion, imagined they were &s;uccours coming to reinforce the enemy; and on this &s;uppo&s;ition betook them&s;elves to flight with the utmo&s;t precipita|tion. Tho&s;e who attended the king hurried him off the field towards the ca&s;tle of Stirling, into which, however the governor would not give him admittance, becau&s;e he was obliged by his capitulation to &s;urrender the ca&s;tle to the victor; &s;o that Edward fled to Dunbar, where he was cordially received by Patrick earl of Marche, who had always been a faithful adherent of his family. Mean while confu&s;ion, rout$ and con&s;ternation, prevailed among the Engli&s;h forces; and victory declared for the Scotti&s;h king, who improved it to the be&s;t advan|tage. A great number of his enemies were &s;lain upon the &s;pot, as well as in the pur&s;uit; and few or none would have e&s;caped, had not his &s;oldiers been &s;o intent upon the booty, which is &s;aid to have amounted in value to two hundred thou&s;and pounds. The earl of Hereford, with John Giffard, John de Wi|lyngton, the earl of Angus, the lords Mounthermer, Percy, Nevil, Scroope, Lucy, Acton, Latimer, Segrave, Berkley, Beauchamp, and other barons, to the number of five and twenty, were taken pri&s;oners, together with a great multitude of bannerets and knights. The number of the &s;lain amounted to about &s;even hundred lords, knights, and e&s;quires, and twenty thou&s;and com|mon &s;oldiers. Nor was the victory purcha&s;ed without blood&s;hed on the &s;ide

of Brus, who lo&s;t above four thou&s;and of his be&s;t men on the field of battle. Douglas was detached with four hundred cavalry to pur&s;ue Edward, who with great difficulty reached the ca&s;tle of Dunbar, in &s;uch trepidation that he made a vow to found a hou&s;e in Oxford for four and twenty Carmelite divines, in ca&s;e he &s;hould e&s;cape the danger by which he was encompa&s;&s;ed. As his pur&s;uer &s;till hovered in the neighbourhood, he would not venture to pro|&s;ecute his journey by land; but embarked on board of a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el, in which he was tran&s;ported to Berwick, where he thought him&s;elf &s;ecure. Robert de Brus treated the pri&s;oners with great humanity. He expre&s;&s;ed unfeigned &s;orrow for the death of Sir Giles de Argentein, to who&s;e worth he was no &s;tranger. The bodies of Glouce&s;ter and lord Clifford were &s;ent to the king of England: the lord Mounthermer, as the ancient friend of Brus, was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed without ran&s;om; the &s;lain were decently interred, the wounded care|fully attended; and the pri&s;oners a&s;&s;ured of liberty as &s;oon as a rea&s;on|able cartel could be e&s;tabli&s;hed. Robert's moderation was altogether admirable.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wal&s;ingham. Mon. Malm.

The conferences were opened at Durham; but the Scotti&s;h deputies in&s;i&s;ting, as a preliminary, upon the king's recog|nizing the title of Brus, and the independence of the Scotti&s;h crown, Edward refu&s;ed to treat upon &s;uch terms, and the negotiation proved ineffectual.</P>

<P>Mean while Edward having taken proper mea&s;ures for the &s;ecurity of Berwick, repaired to York, where he convoked a parliament, to deliberate upon the &s;tate of the nation, and rai&s;e a &s;upply adequate to the pre&s;ent emer|gency: but the barons, in&s;tead of an&s;wering his expectation, complained loudly of the non-ob&s;ervance of the ordinances, and imputed his ill &s;ucce&s;s to the advice of evil coun&s;ellors. The king finding him&s;elf involved in difficulty and di&s;tre&s;s, from which he had no pro&s;pect of being extricated, but by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of parliament, was fain to comply with their demands. Hugh D'E&s;pen&s;er, who had &s;ucceeded to Piers Gave&s;ton in the favour and affection of Edward, was obliged to ab&s;cond; the lord Beaumont was bani&s;hed from court; the chan|cellor, trea&s;urer, &s;heriffs, and other officers, were removed, and their places filled with per&s;ons recommended by the confederate barons. The con&s;ideration of mea&s;ures for the recovery of Scotland was po&s;tponed till the next parliament, on account of the ab&s;ence of the noblemen who were taken pri&s;oners at Ban|nockburn: and that this ob&s;tacle might not retard their operations, a cartel was &s;ettled with the Scots; in con&s;equence of which the Engli&s;h were ex|changed for the wife, &s;i&s;ter, and daughter of Robert de Brus, David earl of Mar, Robert earl of Gla&s;gow, and other per&s;ons of note, who had been taken in the preceding reign. During this &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, Edward<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> de Brus and Douglas, at the head of a &s;trong body of forces, invaded England on the &s;ide of Berwick. They ravaged all Northumberland, laid the bi&s;hopric of Durham under contribution, and penetrating into York&s;hire, de&s;troyed Appleby, Kirkwold, and other places. At the &s;ame time another detach|ment entered the kingdom by Redi&s;dale and Tindale, &s;ubdued all the country, and even compelled the inhabitants to &s;wear allegiance to the Scotti&s;h mo|narch.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1315.</NOTE> Edward finding the &s;ub&s;idy granted by this parliament unequal to his occa&s;ions, &s;ummoned another to meet at We&s;tmin&s;ter in January, where the melancholy &s;tate of the kingdom came under con&s;ideration. The country was not only ravaged by the enemy, but di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with famine; and the par|liament petitioned the king that an ordinance &s;hould be made again&s;t the mo|nopolizers of provi&s;ion. This was accordingly pa&s;&s;ed, but was next year re|pealed, becau&s;e it was &s;ound to de&s;troy the markets. The king confirmed the great charters, and even the late ordinances, and appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to make perambulations through the fore&s;ts. In con&s;ideration of the&s;e com|mi&s;&s;ions, the parliament granted a twentieth of moveables, by which he was enabled to rai&s;e a con&s;iderable army: but, as the &s;ub&s;i$y was in&s;ufficient for its maintenance, he demanded loans from the religious &s;ocieties of the kingdom, and i&s;&s;ued writs fixing the proportion of this extorted ben$volence, by which large &s;ums were brought into the exchequer. While Edward was thus em|ployed in recruiting his exhau&s;ted finances, the Scots di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the Engli&s;h merchants by depredations at &s;ea; and their land-forces entering England, plundered the whole bi&s;hopric of Durham. The king, alarmed at this inva|&s;ion, a&s;&s;embled &s;ome troops, and marched as far north as Berwick; from whence he i&s;&s;ued writs to the carl of Lanca&s;ter and Henry Percy, as well as to all his military tenants, to meet him in arms at Newca&s;tle, in the month of Augu&s;t, and attend him in his purpo&s;ed expedition into Scotland. His orders, however, were very ill obeyed; for the people had not yet recovered of their pannic occa&s;ioned by the defeat at Bannockburn: &s;o that finding him&s;elf too weak to carry on an offen&s;ive war, all he could do was to vi&s;it and put the frontier places in a po&s;ture of defence. Then he returned to London, after having appointed the earl of Pembroke his lieutenant on the northern borders; and empowered the lord Edmund le Botiller ju&s;ticiary of Ireland, to treat with the Iri&s;h chieftians for a body of forces to &s;erve in the purpo&s;ed inva&s;ion of Scotland. Tho&s;e people, far from being di&s;po&s;ed to contribute their a&s;&s;i&s;tance to &s;uch an undertaking, had already re&s;olved to &s;hake off the Engli&s;h yoke. They had long complained of the oppre&s;&s;ion under which they laboured; and the petitions which they had pre&s;ented for redre&s;s had been hitherto neglected by the king and his council. No Iri&s;hman could &s;ue in the king's court, or make a will to di&s;po&s;e of his effects. No female of that country, if married to an Engli&s;hman, could have her dower; the natives could not be admit|ted into any religious order; and if an Iri&s;hman was murdered by an Eng|li&s;hman, the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in was not liable to pro&s;ecution. The chiefs and nobles of Ireland had often petitioned that they might hold their lands in capite of the crown of England, and enjoy the benefit of the Engli&s;h laws; but their reque&s;t was &s;till r$fu&s;ed. Their properties were invaded, their per&s;ons in&s;ulted, their lives taken away, and all &s;atisfaction by the way of law and ju&s;tice had been denied. They had implored the mediation of the pope, which had proved fru$tl$&s;s, at length they &s;o$licited the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Robert de Brus, offering to acknowlege him or his bro$$er Edward as monarch of Ireland, and to join them with all their va&s;&s;als. Edward Br$s being fond of military glory, brave even to ra&s;hne&s;$$ and &s;till $ore ambitious than brave, prevailed upon his brother to let him un$$rta$e $$e $onqu$&s;t of Ireland; and was immediately furni&s;hed with $word$ a$d $$$&s;$$rts for that purpo&s;e. He embarked with &s;ix thou&s;and cho&s;en men, and landing in Ul&s;ter about the beginning of May, was
<PB N="649" REF="6580">
joined by a good number of the Iri&s;h, who con&s;idered him as their deliverer. His fir&s;t attempt was again&s;t Dundalk, which he reduced; then he ravaged Urgyle, and drove the Engli&s;h out of Ul&s;ter. The ju&s;ticiary a&s;&s;embled a body of forces to oppo&s;e his progre&s;s, and the&s;e taking the field under the command of the earl of Ul&s;ter, were defeated near Coleraine. Edward de Brus, after this victory, be&s;ieged and took Carrick-Fergus; and then almo&s;t all the native Iri&s;h in the kingdom, declared again&s;t the Engli&s;h government. Roger d$ Mortimer having levied a fre&s;h army, gave battle to the Scots at Henlis, in Meath, where he was routed with great &s;laughter. The victor reduced &s;eve|ral places in the neighbourhood, and afterwards &s;ubdued the county of Kildare, before the ju&s;ticiary was in a condition to take the field; at length he marched again&s;t him, and was defeated in a pitched battle near Skitheries.</P>

<P>While Edward de Brus proceeded with great rapidity in his con|que&s;t of Ireland, his brother Robert invaded Cumberland, and undertook the &s;iege of Carlile, which was &s;o gallantly defended by Andrew de Harcla, that he was obliged to abandon the enterprize, after having been repul&s;ed in divers a&s;&s;aults, and lo&s;t &s;everal officers of di&s;tinction. There &s;eems to have been a formed de&s;ign of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the Engli&s;h at this juncture, by attacking them in three different quarters; for, exclu&s;ive of the de&s;cent upon Ireland, an in&s;urrection was rai&s;ed in Glamorgan&s;hire by Llewellyn Bren, who had enjoyed a con&s;ider|able po&s;t under the late earl of Glouce&s;ter. Having been deprived of his of|fice at the death of that nobleman, he re&s;ented his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion &s;o highly, that he re&s;olved to employ all his influence, which was very exten&s;ive, in engaging the Wel&s;h in a rebellion. He in a little time found him&s;elf at the head of ten thou&s;and men, with whom he &s;urprized the ca&s;tle of Caer$illy: but the earl of Hereford, and the other lords of the Marches, a&s;&s;embling their va&s;&s;als; and being reinforced by a body of forces &s;ent thither by the king, under the com|mand of W. de Montacute, Llewellyn took refuge in the mountains; from whence he detached parties to fall upon the Engli&s;h &s;tragglers, till at length he was be&s;et on all hands, and propo&s;ed a capitulation; which being refu&s;ed, he &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion. The king, however, thought proper to pacify the di&s;contents of the Wel&s;h$ by granting them certain indulgencies and privi|leges which they had not formerly enjoyed. The fines paid by the tenants to their lords, for the marriages of their daughters, were moderated. Freeholders were allowed to put their &s;ons in holy orders without the king's licence, and to alienate their lands for three years; and orders were given to ob&s;erve the ordinances of Kennington all over the principality. Nor did Edward neglect<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mo$. Ma$m. Rymer.</NOTE> &s;uch mea&s;ures as he thought conducive to the pre&s;ervation of Ireland. He &s;ent a commi&s;&s;ion to John de Hotham for rai&s;ing money by the &s;ale of ward&s;hips and marriages belonging to the crown, in that country, to levy troops again&s;t the Scotti&s;h invaders; promi&s;ed encouragement to all tho&s;e who &s;hould &s;igna|lize them&s;elves in the cour&s;e of the war, and ordered the ju&s;ticiary to remove all officers that &s;eemed unqualified for the places they filled. At this p$ri$d too the king i&s;&s;ued a writ for expelling all the $lemings that were in the king|dom; and he &s;ent orders to all the magi$$rates of his French dominion$, to break o$f all in$ercour&s;e with that people, becau&s;e they were con&s;idered in the light of rebels to the king of France, with whom Edward was at this j$$cture very clo&s;ely conn$cted: but the expul&s;ion o$ the $lemings was grounded upon an article of the treaty between Edward I. of England, and Ph$lip the Fair

of France, who had died in the cour&s;e of the preceding year; a treaty by which the two parties were re&s;tricted from harbouring or &s;uccouring the enemies<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1316.</NOTE> of each other.</P>

<P>A parliament being &s;ummoned to meet at Lincoln, the king de|clared from the throne, that he had a&s;&s;embled them to con&s;ult about the mo&s;t proper means to reduce the rebels of Scotland: but his &s;peech was coldly re|ceived, and the members, without paying any regard to that &s;ubject, proceeded immediately to the con&s;ideration of means to mitigate the famine, which by this time raged all over England. Edward had procured leave from the king of France, for the merchants of Newca&s;tle to buy up provi&s;ions in his domi|nions; and now the act made in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion for regulating the price of pro|vi&s;ion was repealed. When this point was di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, the king, of his own free motion, i&s;&s;ued writs enforcing the ob&s;ervance of all the ordinances and peram|bulations; and the parliament granted a very extraordinary &s;upply for the maintenance of the Scotti&s;h war. Every village or hamlet in the kingdom was taxed at one &s;tout &s;oldier well armed and accoutred, and furni&s;hed with &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence for &s;ixty days; at the expiration of which, he &s;hould be maintained by his maje&s;ty. Market-towns were rated at a greater expence, according to their &s;ize and ability; but with an expre&s;s declaration that this aid &s;hould not be drawn into a precedent: and the towns, boroughs, and cities, of the king's de|me&s;nes were exempted from the impo&s;ition. The king &s;ummoned all the mi|litia of England to the rendezvous at Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, about Mid&s;um|mer; and to defray the expedition, the knights, citizens, and burge&s;&s;es, granted a fifteenth of all their moveables. Edward now acted by the advice of his parliament; and to convince them of his &s;incere intention to govern according to the fundamentals of the con&s;titution, and live in harmony with the noble|men and barons, he, by the mouth of the bi&s;hop of Norwich, propo&s;ed a re|conciliation between him&s;elf and the earl of Lanca&s;ter, whom he invited to pre&s;ide in his councils. That nobleman complied with the invitation, and was appointed commander in chief of all the forces de&s;tined for the Scotti&s;h expe|dition; and writs were i&s;&s;ued, commanding all per&s;ons who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a knight's fee, or fifty pounds a year in land, whether holding of the king or other &s;u|periors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$ot. $word$.</NOTE> to come and receive the order of knighthood. The clergy at this par|liament granted no &s;ub&s;idy, excu&s;ig them&s;elves on account of the famine, which by this time had filled the whole country with horror, death, and de&s;o|lation. The wealthie&s;t noblemen were obliged to di&s;mi&s;s the greate&s;t part of their dome&s;tics. The highways were infe&s;ted with robbery and murder: the &s;treets and public places exhibited the mo&s;t di&s;mal &s;cenes of mi&s;ery and di&s;|tre&s;s. Numbers of wretched creatures were &s;een fainting and dying for want of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and helple&s;s parents lying in the la&s;t agonies, &s;urrounded by their tender offspring, clamorous for food. The pri&s;ons were bur&s;t open, and the malefactors devoured by the de&s;perate populace; the dead became a prey to the living; the graves were robbed of their tenants to allay the rage of hunger; and to &s;uch a degree of horror did this calamity encrea&s;e, that even the mother was known to de&s;troy and feed upon the fruit of her own womb. This dreadful vi&s;itation could not fail to render the pro&s;ecution of the war im|practicable. A kind of army was levied, and marched, under the command of Lanca&s;ter, as far as New$$&s;tle; but this parade was not de&s;igned for &s;er|vice, &s;o much as for giving weight to a negociation which was now &s;et on foot
<PB N="651" REF="6600">
between the two nations. The earl of Angus, Maurice Berkley, and Richard Hor&s;ly, were commi&s;&s;ioned to conclude a truce with the enemy, and confe|rences began; but whether the Scots were too high in their demands, or Edward too inflexible, con&s;idering the mi&s;erable &s;ituation of his country, the treaty mi&s;carried, and the &s;ea&s;on was lo&s;t. The day of rendezvous had been &s;hifted from May till Augu&s;t, in hope that the truce would have rendered it un|nece&s;&s;ary; and &s;ome hi&s;torians alledge that the earl of Lanca&s;ter acted in concert with Robert de Brus, who did not fail to take advantage of the en|feebled &s;tate to which England was by this time reduced. About Mid&s;um|mer the Scotti&s;h forces penetrated into York&s;hire, and laid the inhabitants un|der contribution: then they ravaged the country for &s;ixty miles, in &s;uch a manner as rendered it impracticable for the Engli&s;h army to find the lea&s;t &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence in their march; and returning to Scotland with a va&s;t booty, com|pleted the mi&s;ery of England.</P>

<P>Robert was &s;o little afraid of any effort that Edward could make to the prejudice of his kingdom, that he left Douglas guardian or regent of the realm, and cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea to Ireland with a &s;trong body of forces, in order to complete the conque&s;t of that country. His brother had received a check from the ju&s;ticiary, and retired to Ul&s;ter, where he was detained by a famine equal to that of England, which di&s;abled him from pro&s;ecuting his &s;ucce&s;s. He had, however, a&s;&s;umed the title of king, and e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;y&s;tem of civil government; his brother Robert arriving with &s;uch a powerful reinforce|ment, he con&s;idered the expul&s;ion of the Engli&s;h as an enterprize already at|chieved, and was &s;olemnly crowned king of Ireland at Dundalk. They were joined by the O Neals, O Connors, and other Iri&s;h &s;epts, and penetrated into the heart of the country; but failed in their attempt upon Dublin: and far from reaping any advantage from the expedition, Robert had the mortification to &s;ee his forces daily dimini&s;hed by &s;ickne&s;s and famine, which was &s;o &s;evere that he and his troops were obliged to feed upon the fle&s;h of dogs and hor&s;es, till at length he thought proper to abandon the enterprize, and return to his domi|nions, leaving Edward &s;till in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Ul&s;ter. In all probability a prince of Robert's &s;agacity would not have embarked in &s;uch a romantic undertaking, if he had not received &s;ome a&s;&s;urances of his own kingdom's being left in quiet during his ab&s;ence. It was ob&s;erved$ that when the Scots ravaged the northern counties of England, they always &s;pared the lands and va&s;&s;als belonging to the earl of Lanca&s;ter; and this circum&s;tance &s;ubjected that nobleman to a &s;u&s;|picion that he corre&s;ponded with the king of Scotland. His &s;ub&s;equent conduct &s;eemed to confirm this conjecture: for he did not appear at the general rendez|vous in Augu&s;t; and the king's orders were neglected in the &s;ame manner by all the earl's adherents. Edward having repaired to Newca&s;tle, was provoked by this in&s;tance of di&s;obedience, at a time when &s;uch a fair opportunity offered of reducing Scotland, expo&s;ed as it was by the ab&s;ence of Brus and his ve|terans. He i&s;&s;ued new orders to Lanca&s;ter and the other barons, to appear at Newca&s;tle on the &s;ixth day of October, and &s;ummoned all freeholders to the northward of the Trent, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing fifty pounds a year and upwards, to come with their hor&s;es and arms to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the expedition to Scotland, on pain of forfeiture. Whether they obeyed this peremptory &s;ummons, hi&s;torians do<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot. Scot.

<PB N="653" REF="6620">
the earl of Lanca&s;ter, a prince of the royal blood, the fir&s;t &s;ubject in England, and a man of a proud, imperious temper; but what completed his mortifica|tion, and incen&s;ed him to the highe&s;t pitch of anger and revenge, was the be|haviour of the counte&s;s, who avowed her own &s;hame, and joined in the pro|&s;ecution. He looked upon the deformed knight as a tool of the earl of Surrey, and &s;u&s;pected the king of being concerned in this plot again&s;t his honour and his fortune. He denounced vengeance again&s;t both, and a&s;&s;embled an army of eighteen thou&s;and men, in order to cha&s;ti&s;e the ravi&s;her of his wife, and tho&s;e by whom he was countenanced and abetted. Edward being in no con|dition to cope with &s;uch an adver&s;ary, had recour&s;e to negotiation; and &s;ome efforts were made by moderate people to prevent the calamities of civil war: but the&s;e proving ineffectual, the queen de&s;ired the legates to interpo&s;e their good offices towards an accommodation; which was accordingly effected at Leice&s;ter, with all the exterior marks of &s;incerity. But this peace was not of long duration; for their mutual rancour was too per&s;onal and immoderate to admit of a thorough reconciliation; and the creatures of both fomented the animo&s;ity by fal&s;e in&s;inuations. Among other &s;tories calculated for this pur|po&s;e, the adherents of Lanca&s;ter pretended that he detected a certain knight in his way to Scotland, with a writing, in which the king offered Robert de Brus his own terms, if he would compa&s;s the death of the earl of Lanca&s;ter. This report, though extremely improbable, had great weight with the common people, as well as another circulated at the &s;ame time, and implying that Ed|ward had formed the de&s;ign of &s;urpri&s;ing the earl by treachery, at his ca&s;tle of Pontefract. Edward had the misfortune to be de&s;pi&s;ed, di&s;tru&s;ted, and even hated by his &s;ubjects, who complained that he had broken his engagements, and that therefore they could not depend upon his promi&s;e. They now de|&s;ired<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

He amu&s;ed them with a general an&s;wer, and i&s;&s;ued writs for a new parliament to meet at Lincoln, where he promi&s;ed his &s;ubjects &s;hould receive ample &s;ati&s;|faction; and the cardinals being &s;trangers to his character, as well as to the con&s;titution of the kingdom, were extremely well plea&s;ed with his conde&s;cen|&s;ion. They made &s;ome fruitle&s;s attempts in favour of the papal power, and even hinted that there was a bull on the anvil for prohibiting pluralities, and re&s;erving the benefices to be filled up by his holine&s;s; but finding this motion &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed both by king and people, they returned to Italy, after having &s;ulminated the &s;entence of excommunication and interdict again&s;t the king and the kingdom of Scotland.</P>

After the reduction of that important frontier, he over|ran Northumberland, in which he took the cartles of Werk, Harbottle, and Medford, together with an immen&s;e booty; and he was no &s;ooner returned to his dominions, than he &s;ent Douglas with a body of forces to make an irrup|tion into another part of England.

and Shipton to a&s;hes, and, together with their plunder, carried a great num|ber of pri&s;oners into Scotland. The king apprehending that the earl of Lan|ca&s;ter would come in arms to the parliament at Lincoln, in which ca&s;e &s;ome di&s;turbance might en&s;ue, re&s;olved if po&s;&s;ible to compromi&s;e all matters in di&s;|pute with that nobleman, by a treaty which was now &s;et on foot; the meeting of the parliament was prorogued to the month of July, the place altered to Northampton. In this interval, an impo&s;tor, in all probability di&s;tracted in his brain, laid claim to the crown by hereditary right, as the true &s;on of the late king, alledging that he had been exchanged while at nur&s;e, for the per&s;on who now &s;wayed the &s;ceptre. He made a public declaration to this effect at Oxford, where he was impri&s;oned by the chancellor of the univer&s;ity; and from thence removed to Northampton, where, &s;till per&s;i&s;ting in his extra|vagant<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trivet. Cont.</NOTE> a&s;&s;ertion, he was tried, condemned, and executed as a traitor. Ed|ward was extremely unwilling to confirm the ordinances; and the earl of Lan|ca&s;ter as ob&s;tinately in&s;i&s;ted upon that article as a preliminary of the treaty. Perhaps the negotiation would have proved fruitle&s;s, had not the inva&s;ion of the Scots alarmed the king to &s;uch a degree, that he thought he could not buy an accommodation too dear at &s;uch a critical conjuncture. He therefore agreed to confirm the ordinances, in whatever manner the barons &s;hould propo&s;e, and con&s;ent to a provi&s;ion, by which eight bi&s;hops, four earls, and as many barons, were appointed for his &s;tanding council; four of them to attend quarterly in their turns, and direct the king with their advice in all his tran&s;actions during the intervals of parliament. It was agreed that the earl and his adherents &s;hould have a free pardon for all breaches of the peace and felonies; and that he &s;hould grant relea&s;e and acquittance to all per&s;ons who had done him injury, excepting, however, all &s;uits and actions depending between him and the earl of Surrey. Several bi&s;hops, earls, and barons, undertook for the performance of the&s;e articles, which were &s;igned in Augu&s;t, and afterwards confirmed in parliament. Lanca&s;ter and Warenne were reconciled, Hugh D'E&s;pen&s;er the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer. Mon.

<P>After this accommodation was fini&s;hed, Edward, intent upon an expedition again&s;t the Scots, repaired to York, where he called a parliament, in which the agreement and pardon were ratified; and here he received the agreeable tidings of a total overthrow &s;u&s;tained by Edward de Brus in Ireland. The archbi&s;hop of Dublin having been ve&s;ted with the office of ju&s;ticiary, had appointed the lord John Bermingham general of the Engli&s;h forces in that king|dom, which were reinforced by &s;uccours from England. Brus &s;till continued in Ul&s;ter, and his brother Robert de&s;ired he would not quit his po&s;t, or hazard an encounter, until he &s;hould bring a body of forces to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Edward, over-boiling with an impetuo&s;ity of courage that bordered upon temerity, and intoxicated with the dreams of ambition, could not brook a participation of glory, and re&s;olved to &s;trike &s;ome grand &s;troke before his brother's arrival. With this view he advanced again&s;t the Engli&s;h at the head of a &s;mall body, not exceeding &s;ix thou&s;and Scots and Iri&s;h, and being encountered near Dun|dalk by Bermingham with a numerous army, was totally defeated, and lo&s;t<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annals of Ire|land.

<P>The king, animated by the news of this victory, which put an end to the Iri&s;h war, re&s;olved to improve his good fortune by making an im|mediate irruption into Scotland. He a&s;&s;embled a large body of forces, and a numerous fleet to &s;upply them with provi&s;ions in the enemy's country; but the barons were aver&s;e to a winter campaign, and the clergy refu&s;ed to grant a &s;ub&s;idy without the pope's licence: he was therefore obliged to delay his expe|dition till the &s;pring; and in the mean time &s;ent Hugh D'E&s;pen&s;er the elder to complain at the court of Rome, that the Scots were encouraged to expect a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the cen&s;ures they had incurred. Edward at the &s;ame time ex|po&s;tulated with the earl of Flanders, between who&s;e &s;ubjects and the Engli&s;h the former corre&s;pondence had been renewed, complaining that he countenanced Robert de Brus, and allowed the Scots to trade in his dominions: and he made bitter complaints to all his allies on the continent who recognized that prince as a &s;overeign. But his remon&s;trances had no effect to the prejudice of Robert, who was by this time acknowledged and e&s;teemed by the greate&s;t princes in Europe. In a parliament which met at York after Ea&s;ter, a large &s;ub&s;idy was<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1319.</NOTE> granted by the nobility, freeholders, cities, and boroughs; and the clergy in convocation voted a tenth of their revenues, having by this time obtained the pope's permi&s;&s;ion. The tenth day of June was fixed for the rendezvous of the army, and all the military va&s;&s;als of the crown were &s;ummoned to appear in arms at Newca&s;tle: all the great lords and barons attended with a great num|ber of hor&s;e; and as the king had by proclamation granted to every &s;oldier the booty he &s;hould take, not exceeding one hundred pounds, a prodigious multi|tude of infantry a&s;&s;embled at the time and place appointed. Edward began his march from Newca&s;tle in July, and inve&s;ted the town of Berwick by land, while it was blocked up by &s;ea in &s;uch a manner by the fleet of the Cinque-Ports, that it could not po&s;&s;ibly receive any &s;uccours or provi&s;ion. The ope|rations of the &s;iege were carried on with great vigour and alacrity, and the place was defended with equal courage by the great &s;teward of Scotland, &s;on|in-law of Robert de Brus, who &s;u&s;tained &s;everal de&s;perate a&s;&s;aults; in &s;ome of which the Engli&s;h had actually mounted the ramparts. They were &s;o ad|vantageou&s;ly po&s;ted, that Robert could not attack them with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s; and therefore he re&s;olved to make a diver&s;ion in favour of the be|&s;ieged. The queen re&s;ided in a village near York, little dreaming &s;he was in any danger from the Scots, who were &s;uppo&s;ed to be too much engro&s;&s;ed by the defence of their own country, to &s;pare troops for an expedition into Eng|land. Robert formed a plan for &s;urpri&s;ing this prince&s;s; and the lord Douglas being charged with the execution, advanced with a body of cho&s;en men to|wards the place of his de&s;tination. But the de&s;ign mi&s;carried: for one of his &s;pies being apprehended at York, was put to the torture, and di&s;clo&s;ed his in|tention; &s;o that the queen was removed to York, and from thence conveyed to Nottingham. The archbi&s;hip being determined to &s;urprize the Scots in his turn, a&s;&s;embled his tenants, va&s;&s;als, and clergy, to the number of ten thou|&s;and, and marched &s;ilently for York, towards Milton on the Swale, where, by the information of the &s;py, he knew the enemy would be quartered on that day. Douglas, however, was too vigilant an officer to &s;uffer him&s;elf to be &s;urprized. His men were already in order of battle; and, as the Engli&s;h ap|proached with the wind in their faces, he ordered a great quantity of wet &s;$raw to be kindled.

<P>The $word$ at Barwick gave great umbrage to the whole na|tion.

The Scots, not &s;atisfied with the booty they had obtained, made another incur&s;ion in November, ravaged all Gilli&s;land, as far as Burough under Stanmore, and left the three northern counties in a &s;tate of de&s;olation. The country was now &s;o exhau&s;ted, that the Scots had nothing further to expect from another inva|&s;$on; and therefore Robert de Brus li&s;tened to propo&s;als for a ce&s;&s;ation. Ed|ward granted a &s;afe-conduct to ten deputies of that kingdom, who &s;hould meet his commi&s;&s;ioners at Newca&s;tle, to treat of a truce; which, after much di&s;|pute and a$tercation, was concluded for two years, to the un&s;peakable &s;ati&s;+f$c$$on of Edward, who, in con&s;ideration of the lo&s;&s;es to which his northern $word$ had been expo&s;ed, excu&s;ed them from paying the tenth which had been granted in parliament.</P>

<P>The community of Scotland had writ a letter to the pope, &s;tating the difference between them and the Engli&s;h, and &s;olliciting his holine&s;s not only to remove the interdict which he had laid upon the kingdom, but al&s;o to ab&s;olve Robert de Brus, and employ his good offices to terminate in an equitable manner the war which had raged &s;o long, to the un&s;peakable preju|dice of both nations. Though the pope did not comply with the former part of their reque&s;t, he directed a bull to Edward, exhorting him to re&s;tore peace to the i&s;land; and he accordingly appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with the Scotti&s;h deputies. The king of France de&s;ired that his amba&s;&s;adors might a&s;&s;i&s;t at the conferences; but Edward declined granting this reque&s;t, becau&s;e he had rea&s;on to think Philip was bia&s;&s;ed in favour of the enemy; and the ne|gotiation proved ineffectual. The populace of London had ri&s;en again&s;t the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1321.</NOTE> magi&s;trates, on pretence of being unequally a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and other grievances; and in one of their riots a Lombard had lo&s;t his life. Some itinerant ju&s;tices were ordered to hold a court in the Tower, and enquire into the&s;e di&s;orders; when the ringleaders of the riots were tried and puni&s;hed according to their demerits. The mayoralty of the city was &s;eized into the hands of the king, and Robert de Kendal appointed guardian. Though the liberties were &s;oon re&s;tored, this tran&s;action produced loud clamours among the citizens, who looked upon their being &s;ummoned to a court in the Tower as an infringe|ment of their privileges, which they imputed to the evil coun&s;el of the two D'E&s;pen&s;ers, again&s;t whom they expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t implacable re&s;entment. The&s;e two mini&s;ters were now become odious to the whole nation. The fa|ther was a brave warrior, a wi&s;e coun&s;ellor, and of an unexceptionable cha|racter, in every other re&s;pect but his attachment to his &s;on, who trod in the foot|&s;teps of his predece&s;&s;or Gave&s;ton, and greatly re&s;embled that favourite in his per&s;onal endowments, as well as in his pride and ambition. He had been at fir&s;t forced upon the king by the earl of Lanca&s;ter, as chamberlain of the hou&s;hold; in which capacity he had ingratiated him&s;elf with Edward by his per&s;onal beauty and ob&s;equious behaviour, until he gained &s;uch an a&s;cendency over him as Gave&s;ton had formerly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Then he began to direct all the mea&s;ures of the government with the mo&s;t arbitrary influence; and, from a dependent, became the rival of Lanca&s;ter. Perhaps his greate&s;t crime was his oppo&s;ition to that popular and turbulent nobleman. Not but that he made a very bad u&s;e of his power. He had married Eleanor, one of the coheire&s;&s;es of Gilbert de Clare, late earl of Glouce&s;ter, and in right of this

lady, enjoyed the be&s;t part of Glamorgan&s;hire: but his avarice being in&s;atiable, he encroached upon the &s;hares of the other &s;i&s;ters; and even u&s;urped the lands belonging to other proprietors. He &s;eized the ca&s;tle of Newport from Hugh de Audeley, who married one of his &s;i&s;ters-in-law; and afterwards, by dint of threats, extorted a conveyance from him, to confirm his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions: he like|wi&s;e pre$ailed upon the king to re&s;ume the grants of &s;ome ca&s;tles he had be|&s;towed upon Roger de Mortimer, and appropriated them to his own u&s;e and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dugi$le</NOTE> convenience. But no part of his conduct gave &s;uch offence as his di&s;pute with John de Mowbray, who had had married Aliva, daughter of William de Braou&s;e, lord of Gower. This nobleman had, by a &s;pecial deed, granted the lands and honour of Gower to his daughter and &s;on-in-law Mowbray, and to the heirs of their bodies lawfully begotten, with remainder to Humphrey Bo|hun earl of Hereford$ and his heirs. Mowbray, by virtue of this deed, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion fo the land without any licence from the king, of whom it held in capite; and young D'E&s;pen&s;er made u&s;e of this pretence to obtain judgment, by which the lands were forfeited.</P>

Hugh de Audeley was glad of an opportunity to recover his ca&s;tle of Newport; Roger Damory, who had married the third coheire&s;s of Glouce&s;ter, &s;eemed to dread the &s;ame inju&s;tice; Roger de Mortimer re&s;ented the re&s;umption; John de Mowbray and the earl of Hereford were deeply intere&s;ted again&s;t him, for his attempt to &s;eize the land of Gower; Roger de Clifford thought him&s;elf injured in a tran&s;action between his mother and D'E&s;pen&s;er, about the e&s;tate of Thomas de Clare; and the other barons of the Marches e&s;pou&s;ed the quarrel of the&s;e noblemen, either out of fear and hatred of the mini&s;ter, or affection and attachment to the con|federates. As they could not expect redre&s;s in a legal way, they re&s;olved to take vengeance upon Hugh by force of arms, and &s;ollicited the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the earl of Lanca&s;ter, which was promi&s;ed without he&s;itation. They began to cabal among other noblemen, and a&s;&s;emble in different places, to concert mea&s;ures for the execution of their de&s;ign, notwith&s;tanding the orders of the king, who prohibited the&s;e &s;editious conventicles. At length they took the field, and &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the king, demanding that he would di&s;mi&s;s Hugh le D'E&s;pen&s;er, or commit him to &s;afe cu&s;tody, that he might be forthcoming to an&s;wer for the crimes and mi&s;demeanors laid to his charge; otherwi&s;e they would renounce their allegiance, and do ju&s;tice on the criminal by their own authority. Edward, &s;hocked at this intimation, repaired to Glouce&s;ter, where he ordered the malecontents to attend him; but they refu&s;ed to appear. Then he proceeded to Bri&s;tol, in order to provide for the &s;ecurity of tho&s;e parts, and cru&s;h the confederacy in the bud. But all he could do was to reduce an in|con&s;iderable ca&s;tle belonging to Roger Damory, and order the lands of Hugh de Audeley to be confi&s;cated. He no &s;ooner &s;et out on his return to London, than the malecontents be&s;ieged and took Newport-ca&s;tle, which they delivered to the right owner: they found no difficulty in reducing all the &s;trengths belonging to D'E&s;pen&s;er, who was &s;o dete&s;ted in Wales that the people, even his own va&s;&s;als, would not act in his defence. The barons there|fore ravaged all Glamorgan&s;hire without oppo&s;ition, and committed the mo&s;t barbarous exce&s;&s;es.</P>

<P>Some of the king's council advi&s;ed Edward to retort the&s;e vio|lences upon the lands of the barons; but the majority apprehending that &s;uch repri&s;als would inflar$e matters to a civil war, it was judged more expedient to i&s;&s;ue a proclamation to forbid the continuance of ho&s;tilities, and to call a par|liament at We&s;tmin&s;ter, where complaints might be heard, and ju&s;tice done to the injured. Mean while the confederate barons marched to Sherburn in York&s;hire, where they engaged in an a&s;&s;ociation with the earl of Lanca&s;ter and his adherents, and &s;igned an in&s;trument obliging them&s;elves to exert their ut|mo&s;t power in the pro&s;ecution of the two D'E&s;pen&s;ers. Then they advanced with a numerous army towards London, committing terrible ravages in their march; and when they reached St. Albans, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the king, in&s;i&s;t|ing upon the bani&s;hment of the father and &s;on, and an indemnity for them|&s;elves. Edward replied that the father was employed abroad, and the &s;on doing his duty at &s;ea, in guarding the Cinque-Ports; that he could not, with any regard to ju&s;tice, bani&s;h them before they were heard; that they were ready to an&s;wer for them&s;elves when legally charged with the breach of any law or &s;tatute; and that he him&s;elf was re&s;trained by his coronation-oath from pardoning rebels and perturbators of the public peace. The barons, incen&s;ed at this an&s;wer, marched immediately towards London, and took up their quar|ters about Clerkenwell and Holborn, while the king remained in a defencele&s;s condition at We&s;tmin&s;ter, to which he had &s;ummoned a parliament, that was then &s;itting. The confederates drew up articles of impeachment again&s;t the two D'E&s;pen&s;ers, charging them with having mi&s;led the king by their evil coun&s;els. They accu&s;ed the &s;on of an attempt to draw John de Giffard and Richard de Grey, two of the di&s;contented barons, into a con&s;piracy; for compelling the king to act according to his direction; of having put Llewellyn to death after he had &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion; of procuring unju&s;t grants of ward&s;hips; of in&s;olence to the king and the nobles; of turning good mini&s;ters and officers out of their places, and filling them with his own creatures; of &s;eizing the lands belonging to Hugh de Audeley; of pro&s;ecuting John de Mowbray on pretence of his having for&s;eited the land of Gower; and of per&s;uading the king to hinder the barons to re&s;ume the lands which their ance&s;tors had granted to the Knights-Templars. This impeachment being prepared, they carried it to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wal&s;ing$un. M. W. $$nt.</NOTE> the parliament, where it was read in pre&s;ence of the king and the nobility, who did not think proper to make any objections, as the hall was filled with armed people. When it had thus received the approbation of the a&s;&s;embly, it was enacted in form of a &s;tatute, that both the D'E&s;pen&s;ers had for&s;eited their e&s;tates, and &s;hould be condemned to perpetual exile, unle&s;s recalled by the common con&s;ent of the king, prelates, and lords in parliament. The male|contents, con&s;cious of the illegality of their proceedings, demanded a pardon and indemnity, which was granted in the mo&s;t ample form, and confirmed in parliament. The &s;entence again&s;t the D'E&s;pen&s;ers was publi&s;hed: the eld$$ continued abroad, and the younger committed pyracies at &s;ea; while the ba|rons returned to their homes, though they &s;till kept them&s;elves in a po&s;ture of defence. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>The king had not dige&s;ted this affront and violence offered to his per&s;on and prerogative, when his re&s;entment was &s;till more inflamed by a fre&s;h in&s;ult upon his royal dignity. The queen, in a journey of devotion to Can|terbury, &s;ent her officers to demand lodging at the ca&s;tle of Ledes, belonging
<PB N="660" REF="6690">
to B$$thol$m$w de Badle$mere$ who had been under manifold obligations to Edward, but had lately abandoned his intere&s;t and joined the di&s;contented ba|rons. He was not him&s;elf in the ca&s;tle; but his wife refu&s;ed admittance to the queen, or any per&s;on whatever, without an order from her hu&s;band; and told the dome&s;tics they might go and provide lodging for their mi&s;tre&s;s in &s;ome other place; for they &s;hould not enter her ca&s;tle. The queen went in per&s;on to the gate, and not only met with a repul&s;e, but &s;aw &s;ix of her attendants killed by the garri&s;on. Incen&s;ed at this outrage, &s;he complained to the king, and d$manded reparation for the affront &s;he had undergone. Edward readily entered into her re&s;entment, and a&s;&s;embling a body of forces, inve&s;ted the ca&s;tle, which was well provided with all nece&s;&s;aries to &s;u&s;tain a &s;iege. The barons of the Wel&s;h Marches advanced as far as King&s;ton in their way to the relief of the place: but the earl of Lanca&s;ter, who hated Badle&s;mere, refu&s;ing to &s;end the &s;uc|cours they &s;ollicited$ they found them&s;elves too weak to give the king battle: the$ they propo&s;ed that ho&s;tilities &s;hould cea&s;e until a parliament could be a&s;&s;embled; but this propo&s;al being rejected, they thought proper to retire. The ca&s;tle held out until their provi&s;ions were con&s;umed, and then &s;urrendered at di&s;|cretion. Walter de Colepepper the governor, and eleven of his officers were executed as traitors; the re&s;t of the defendants impri&s;oned in different places,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mon.

<P>The eld$r D'E&s;pen&s;er, encouraged by the &s;ucce&s;s of this enter|prize, which &s;eemed to denote &s;uch courage and re&s;olution in Edward as he had never ob&s;erved before, returned from exile in the beginning of November, and was very cordially received by his &s;overeign. The earl of Lanca&s;ter was no &s;ooner informed of his return, than he loudly inveighed again&s;t his pre|&s;umption, as well as the perfidy of Edward, upon who&s;e promi&s;e, and even oath, his &s;ubjects could not depend. He &s;ummoned all the barons to meet him at Donca&s;ter, and re&s;olved to call in a body of Scots to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Circular letters were &s;ent over all England to &s;pirit up the people to a revolt; and the ca&s;tle of Warwick, belonging to the king during the minority of earl Thomas, was &s;eized by the malecontents. The king, by proclamation, forbade all meetings and a&s;&s;ociations, contrary to law and the peace of the kingdom: the younger D'E&s;pen&s;er now returned to England, and pre&s;ented a petition, complaining of the illegal &s;entence which had been pronounced again&s;t him, and offering to a&s;&s;ert his own innocence again&s;t all accu&s;ation. He was com|mitted to cu&s;tody, and his e&s;tate taken into the royal protection, until he &s;hould have the benefit of a fair trial. His petition was con&s;idered by the prelates belonging to the province of Canterbury, a&s;&s;embled at London, who condemned the &s;entence as erroneous and unju&s;t: then Hugh was &s;et at liberty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> and re-admitted into the king's council. Edward finding him&s;elf &s;upported by the earls of Kent, Richmond, Pembroke, Arundel, Norfolk, Surrey, Athol, and many other noblemen of great influence, re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ert his authority and prerogative, by cha&s;ti&s;ing the confederate barons. He reduced all the ca&s;tles belonging to Badle&s;mere and his a&s;&s;ociates, in the neighbourhood of London; and having a&s;&s;embled a numerous army, marched in the middle of winter towards the frontiers of Wales, taking in his route all the fortre&s;&s;es po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by his enemies. The lords of the Marches had &s;eized the town and ca&s;tle of Glouce&s;ter, burned tho&s;e of Elm&s;ly and Henley, and ravaged the ad|jacent<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1$22.</NOTE> country. The king pa&s;&s;ed his Chri&s;tmas at Cirence&s;ter, then marched
<PB N="661" REF="6700">
to Worce&s;ter, and from thence to Shrew&s;bury; but in his route a detachment which he had &s;ent before him to Bridgnorth, was &s;urprized and cut off, and the town reduced to a&s;hes by the barons, who had drawn their forces on that &s;ide to oppo&s;e the king's progre&s;s. Neverthele&s;s they found them&s;elves too weak to hazard an encounter with Edward's army; and being afraid to coop them&s;elves up in ca&s;tles, le&s;t they &s;hould meet with the fate of the garri&s;on of Ledes, part of them &s;ubmitted to the king's mercy, while the earl of Hereford, with the remainder, marched northward to join the earl of Lanca&s;ter. Of tho&s;e who &s;ubmitted, the two Mortimers were &s;ent to the Tower; Maurice Berke|ley and Hugh Audeley were committed to the ca&s;tle of Wallingford, and the re&s;t impri&s;oned in different parts of the kingdom.</P>

<P>Edward having thus triumphed over all oppo&s;ition in the Marches of Wales, &s;eized into his own hands all the ca&s;tles and e&s;tates of the rebels, &s;ecured the peace of the country, and ordered all the prelates to &s;end their pro|portions of hor&s;e and foot to join his army at Coventry. In the mean time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mon. Malm.</NOTE> the truce with Scotland being expired, Thomas Randolph earl of Murray, and the lord James Douglas, entered Northumberland with a body of forces, and ad|vancing to Corbridge, de&s;olated the whole country. This incur&s;ion is &s;aid to have been made at the de&s;ire of the earl of Lanca&s;ter, who &s;ent John de Mow|bray, and Roger de Clifford, to conclude a formal treaty between Robert de Brus and the earls of Lanca&s;ter and Hereford, with their allies. This confe|deracy being e&s;tabli&s;hed, the earl of Hereford inve&s;ted the ca&s;tle of Tykehill, belonging to the crown; but the king advancing to the relief of the place, he rai&s;ed the &s;iege, and joining Lanca&s;ter, took po&s;t at Burton upon Trent, to prevent Edward's cro&s;&s;ing the river. They took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the bridge, which they maintained three days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively again&s;t the attacks of the royal army. At length the king forded the river a good way above the bridge, and Lanca&s;ter re&s;olved to give him battle. For that purpo&s;e he marched again&s;t him with great confidence and alacrity; but when he perceived the great &s;uperiority in the number of the enemy, which amounted to thirty thou&s;and, his heart failed him, and he retired northwards with great precipitation. Robert lord Holland coming up with a reinforcement of five hundred men to the earl immediately after his retreat, and concluding he was defeated and taken, &s;ubmitted to the king, and was &s;ent pri&s;oner to Dover. The ca&s;tles of Kenilworth and Tut|bury &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion; and the earls of Kent and Surrey pur&s;ued the fugitives to Pontefract-ca&s;tle, belonging al&s;o to the earl of Lanca&s;ter, who threw in a reinforcement, and continued his flight in hope of finding refuge in the Scotti&s;h army: but when he reached Borough-bridge, he found Sir Simon Warde, and Sir Andrew de Harcla, governors of York and Carlile, ready to oppo&s;e his pa&s;&s;age, at the head of an army which they had rai&s;ed for that pur|po&s;e by his maje&s;ty's order. Lanca&s;ter and Hereford finding them&s;elves thus hemmed in between two bodies of the enemy, re&s;olved to force the bridge be|fore their pur&s;uers &s;hould come up; and, though they mi&s;carried in their at|tempt, Hereford and his men forded the river; but he was &s;lain before he could mount his hor&s;e on the other &s;ide, and his followers repul&s;ed with Ro|ger de Clifford, who retired into the town very dangerou&s;ly wounded. Lan|ca&s;ter endeavoured to pa&s;s at another ford; but finding it guarded by the enemy, he attempted to bribe Harcla to connive at his pa&s;&s;age. That officer rejecting all his offers with di&s;dain, he concluded a truce with him till next
<PB N="662" REF="6710">
morning, and returned to Borough-bridge, in&s;tead of making a bold effort to r$p$l the enemy, to whom he was greatly &s;uperior in number. Harcia was joined in the night by the &s;heriff of York&s;hire, and entering the town early in the morning, took Lanca&s;ter, with above a hundred barons, bannerets, and knights, without the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance. Be&s;ides the&s;e, a great number of gentle|men were taken and conveyed to York; though many changed their apparel for rags, and e&s;caped in the di&s;gui&s;e of beggars.</P>

<P>Edward was now ble&s;&s;ed with an opportunity of glutting his revenge again&s;t his mo&s;t dangerous adver&s;ary; and he enjoyed it with all the triumph of a weak mind, that never harboured one &s;entiment of genero&s;ity. He proceeded to the earl's ca&s;tle of Pontefract, which &s;urrendered upon the fir&s;t news of his misfortune; and &s;ending for the pri&s;oner from York, ordered him to be lodged one night in a tower which he was &s;aid to have built as a pri&s;on for his maje&s;ty. He was now for&s;aken by his popularity, in &s;uch a manner that his own va&s;&s;als in&s;ulted him in the &s;treets of Pontefract, through which he was conveyed to the ca&s;tle. They reviled him in the mo&s;t abu&s;ive terms, and in deri&s;ion &s;tiled him king Arthur, a fictitious name which he a&s;&s;umed in his corre&s;pondence with Scotland. In the morning after his arrival, he was brought into the pre&s;ence of the king, who upbraided him with his pride, in|&s;olence, and trea&s;on. A kind of court-martial being con&s;tituted by the earls of Kent, Richmond, Pembroke, Surrey, Arundel, Athol, and Angus, he was found guilty of appearing in arms again&s;t the king at Burton and Bo|rough-bridge, and condemned to be drawn, hanged, and quartered, as a traitor. In con&s;ideration of his being a prince of the blood, the &s;entence was changed into decapitation, and executed immediately after condemnation, with all the marks of di&s;grace, by way of retaliation for the death of Gave&s;ton. He was mounted upon a meagre hor&s;e, without &s;addle or bridle, conveyed through Pontefract with a hood upon his head, to an eminence at the di&s;tance of a mile from the town; there he was ordered to &s;tand with his face towards Scot|land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wal$ingham. M. W$$. Mon. Ma$m.</NOTE> and beheaded by a Londoner. The &s;ame &s;entence was denounced again&s;t Warin de L'I&s;le, William Touchet, Thomas Maudnet, Henry de Brade|bourn, William Fitz-Williams, William Cheyney, Jo&s;&s;elin de Deinville, and the lords Mowbray and Clifford, who underwent the pains and penalties of the law without mitigation. The life of Hugh de Audeley was &s;aved, be|cau&s;e he had married the king's niece: John de Botetourt, John de King&s;ton, Nicholas de Piercy, John de Montravers, and William Tan&s;el, e&s;caped to the continent. The lord Badle&s;mere, and Bertram de A&s;hburnam, were hanged, drawn, and quartered at Canterbury. Sir T. Colepepper &s;uffered the &s;ame death at Winchel&s;ey; John Giffard and Sir Roger Elme&s;bruge were executed at Glouce&s;ter; Stephen Barret at Swane&s;eye; William Fleming at Cardiff; H. de Tyeys at London; Sir Francis Aldenham at Wind&s;or, and others<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leland.</NOTE> at different places of the kingdom. This hecatomb being devoted to the ven|geance of the king and his mini&s;ters, the earl of Pembroke was gratified with a grant of the New Temple, which had belonged to Lanca&s;ter; the lands of Clifford, Mowbray, and Damory, were divided between the earl of Richmond and the bi&s;hop of Durham; the lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained by the elde&s;t D'E&s;pen&s;er, from the depredations of the barons, were compen&s;ated by &s;everal rich manours; and the &s;on not only engro&s;&s;ed a great number of the forfeited e&s;tates, but al&s;o ex$orted immen&s;e &s;ums by way of compo&s;ition from tho&s;e who were pardoned.
<PB N="663" REF="6720">
His behaviour on this occa&s;ion di&s;played &s;uch cruelty and avarice as rendered him more odious than ever to the nation; and in the end proved the ruin of him&s;elf and his ma&s;ter, who&s;e favour he &s;o &s;hamefully abu&s;ed. Before the action at Borough-bridge, the king had i&s;&s;ued writs for a parliament to meet at York in May, when all the ordinances which he had been compelled to pa&s;s, were aboli&s;hed; and the proce&s;s again&s;t the two D'E&s;pen&s;ers was revi&s;ed and repealed. The elder was created earl of Winche&s;ter, and Andrew de Harcla rewarded for his &s;ervices with the earldom of Carlile.</P>

<P>Edward having re&s;olved upon an expedition into Scotland, &s;um|moned his military tenants to meet him at Newca&s;tle in July; and the parlia|ment voted a &s;ub&s;idy for the expence of that enterprize. Every village was taxed at one foot &s;oldier, and the great towns at a greater number, to be main|tained forty days at the expence of the inhabitants: the barons, knights, and freeholders, granted a tenth; and the cities, boroughs, and towns of ancient deme&s;ne, a &s;ixth of their moveables. Nor were the clergy backward in grant|ing an aid for the purpo&s;es of this armament. While Edward was employed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dugdale. Rymer. Mat. We&s;t.</NOTE> in making preparations, Robert de Brus and his two generals Murray and Douglas, entered England at different places, and penetrated as far as Lanca&s;hire, where they joined to ravage the country, from whence they carried off immen&s;e plunder by the way of Carlile. The king having a&s;&s;embled a numerous army, and equipped a powerful fleet, the command of which was given to Robert Ley|burn, a &s;ailor of great courage and experience, he marched into Scotland, where he found the country de&s;olated by order of Brus, who had removed all his &s;ub|jects, with their effects, to the northward of the Forth, that the Engli&s;h might find no &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in his country. Edward advanced as far as Edinburgh, without &s;eeing the face of an enemy; and his fleet being detained by contrary winds, he began to be grievou&s;ly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for want of provi&s;ions. After having wre&s;tled &s;ome time with that difficulty, he pillaged &s;ome convents, and re|turned towards his own country; attended by Robert de Brus, at the head of his forces, who harra&s;&s;ed him in his march, and even followed him into England, intercepting his convoys and &s;urpri&s;ing his detachments. At length both armies engaged near the abbey of Bycland, and Edward being routed, e&s;caped with difficulty to York: but all his furniture, plate, and money, together with the earl of Richmond, fell into the hands of the Scots, to whom the ca&s;tle of Norham &s;urrendered. They burned the town of Rippon, layed Beverley under contribution, ravaged the whole North-Riding, and in&s;ulted Edward under the walls of the city. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Wal&s;ingham.</NOTE></P>

<P>The people of the three northern counties were &s;o harra&s;&s;ed and exhau&s;ted by tho&s;e incur&s;ions, as well as the palatinate of Durham, that they &s;et on foot a treaty for a truce with the enemy; and it was actually concluded without the king's knowledge. Edward under&s;tanding that this affair was tran&s;acted with the privity of Andrew de Harcla earl of Carlile, &s;ummoned him to court to an&s;wer for his conduct; and he di&s;obeying the citation, an order was i&s;&s;ued to apprehend him, and the earl of Kent made warden of the Scotti&s;h Marches. Harcla by this time had deviated from his allegiance to Edward, either through hatred to the younger D'E&s;pen&s;er, or the ambition of a&s;piring at an alliance with Robert de Brus, who&s;e &s;i&s;ter he demanded in mar|riage. He had already engaged in a confederacy with that prince, and obliged him&s;elf by oath to maintain his title to the throne of Scotland again&s;t all per|&s;ons.

whatever. They agreed likewi&s;e to certain conditions of a la&s;ting peace $word$ be ob&s;erved by both nations; and as the terms were calculated for their mutual intere&s;t, re&s;olved to compel the king to embrace them, &s;hould he refu&s;e his voluntary a&s;&s;ent. Harcla over-rated his own merit and authority, and was probably intoxicated by the honour he had lately received. He took no pains to conceal this tran&s;action; and the articles of his alliance tran&s;piring, were very well reli&s;hed by the common people. But, in the mid&s;t of all his gay projects, he was taken by his own intimate friend Anthony Lucy, high &s;heriff of Cum|berland, and delivered to the king's ju&s;tices, by whom he was tried for high<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> trea&s;on, convicted and condemned to death. He was degraded from his knight|hood and dignity, and then drawn, hanged, and quartered, at Carlile. The king, by a late treaty with the count of Flanders, had precluded the Scots from any farther a&s;&s;i&s;tance from that country; he had re&s;olved to make an|other expedition into Scotland, during the en&s;uing &s;ummer, and &s;ent for the earl of Ul&s;ter, with a &s;trong body of Iri&s;h forces, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in that undertaking. Neverthele&s;s, he did not reject the overtures of peace, which were made in the name of Brus, by Henry de Sully the French envoy, who had been taken pri&s;oner by the Scots, and relea&s;ed. Conferences were opened at New|ca&s;tle between the deputies of both kingdoms; but as Brus in&s;i&s;ted upon being acknowledged king of Scotland, and Edward ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to grant him that title, becau&s;e in &s;o doing he mu&s;t have given up his preten&s;ions to the conque&s;t of his father, a treaty of peace &s;eemed altogether impracticable. A truce, however, was effected, to continue from March to Trinity|&s;unday, and afterwards prolonged for a fortnight; before the expiration of which, the commi&s;&s;ioners agreed to an accommodation, in the form of a truce, for thirteen years. By the articles of this agreement, it was &s;tipulated that a free commerce &s;hould be carried on between the two nations; but no other corre&s;pondence between the &s;ubjects, without a &s;pecial licence from the con&s;ervators of the truce: that no new ca&s;tles &s;hould be erected on the borders, nor old fortre&s;&s;es be repaired; but that the truce &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the two kingdoms, even though the king of England, or the lord Robert de Brus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

This agreement was concluded at Thorpe in York&s;hire, by the earl of Pembroke and Hugh D'E&s;pen&s;er the younger, and confirmed with the a&s;&s;ent of the king's council; though the lord Beaumont di&s;&s;ented from the other coun&s;ellors, and was im|pri&s;oned<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> for his contumacy. Immediately after this agreement, Edward coun|termanded the forces which he had be&s;poke from Ireland and Ga&s;cony, and laid a&s;ide all his other warlike preparations; while Robert de Brus renewed his application to the pope for annulling the &s;entence of excommunication which had been denounced again&s;t him and his kingdom. His people had been &s;o long u&s;ed to war and depredation, that he found it very difficult to re&s;train them from infringing the truce by ho&s;tilities; and in all probability he repented of having concluded a ce&s;&s;ation for &s;uch a length of time, during which the martial &s;pirit of his &s;ubjects would langui&s;h and expire. He therefore re&s;olved to ri&s;e in his demands upon England, and gave Edward to under&s;tand that the Scots expected the truce &s;hould be changed into a formal treaty of perpetual peace, otherwi&s;e he could not undertake to prevent their incur&s;ions. This in&s;inuation produced conferences at York, in which the Scots demanded an ab|&s;olute relea&s;e from all &s;ubordination or homage to the crown of England,

together with the property of all the northern counties as far as York; and the manours of Writtle and Notfield in E&s;&s;ex, which formerly belonged to Ro|bert de Brus. They likewi&s;e propo&s;ed a marriage between the daughter of their king and prince Edward; and that the&s;e articles &s;hould be confirmed before the pope and the French king, by the oaths of Engli&s;h noblemen. The&s;e de|mands were rejected with di&s;dain by the Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners; and Brus finding his menaces ineffectual, thought proper to ob&s;erve the truce, which he could not have infringed with any regard to his reputation.</P>

<P>The war with Scotland, which had produced infinite mi&s;chiefs to both kingdoms, was now happily fini&s;hed, and &s;alutary mea&s;ures were taken for re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the public tranquillity, by putting the laws in execu|tion again&s;t tho&s;e robbers and di&s;turbers of the commonwealth, who had been encouraged by the di&s;orders of the kingdom. Neverthele&s;s, the nation was not freed from trouble and di&s;quiet; for tho' the earl of Lanca&s;ter was dead, his party &s;till &s;urvived; and the &s;ubjects in general were exa&s;perated again&s;t the two D'E&s;pen&s;ers, who by this time engro&s;&s;ed the whole regal au|thority. An enterpri&s;ing partizan called Robert Lewen, who had been inured to war and rapine, a&s;&s;embled a number of de&s;perate people and plundered the lands belonging to the earl of Winche&s;ter. He made an attempt to &s;eize his per&s;on, but the earl took refuge in the ca&s;tle of Wind&s;or; and the king &s;ent the earl of Kent with a body of troops to his relief. Robert finding him&s;elf in no condition to oppo&s;e this detachment, retired at their approach; and being pur&s;ued from place to place, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his followers, with a view to retire beyond &s;ea with his wife and family. He was di&s;covered at Southampton, apprehended, and brought to his trial: but he refu&s;ed to an&s;wer, and was or|dered to be pre&s;&s;ed; a &s;pecies of torment which he bore without &s;peaking, un|til death put an end to his torture. This was not the only attempt again&s;t the power of Winche&s;ter and his &s;on. The Lanca&s;ter faction formed a plan for relea&s;ing all their confederates who were impri&s;oned in different parts of the kingdom, and &s;eizing the ca&s;tles in which they were confined. The ca&s;tle of Wallingford was &s;urprized by the friends of Maurice de Berkeley and Hugh de Audeley, who were kept in that fortre&s;s; but the town being alarmed be|fore their a&s;&s;ociates could be admitted, the place was blocked up by the militia, until the earls of Kent and Winche&s;ter arrived with a body of troops to re|duce it by force. Then the con&s;pirators de&s;pairing of being able to defend the ca&s;tle, &s;et the gates wide open, and fled for &s;anctuary to the chapel, from which they were violently dragged, and after trial executed as traitors. About this time Roger Mortimer of Wigmore made his e&s;cape from the Tower, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of one Gerard de Al&s;paye, a dome&s;tic of Stephen de Segrave the con&s;table. This man being gained over to his intere&s;t, mixed a &s;oporiferous medicine in the drink of the warders, and when they were fa&s;t a&s;leep, con|ducted him to the water-&s;ide, where he hired a boat which tran&s;ported him to the oppo&s;ite &s;hore. There his &s;ervants attended with hor&s;es, and he rode di|rectly<NOTE PLACE="marg">Knyghton. Chron. Bian l. M. We&s;t.

<P>Edward had &s;carce quelled the di&s;turbances within his own do|minions, when he was embroiled in a quarrel with the king of France. Charles le Bel, who &s;ucceeded his brother Philip le Long in the throne of that kingdom, had &s;ummoned Edward to a&s;&s;i&s;t at his coronation, and do homage
<PB N="666" REF="6750">
for Guienne and P$nthi$u. He had been amu&s;ed with various excu&s;es &s;ug|ge&s;ted by the D'E&s;pen&s;ers, who were aver&s;e to a voyage into France, be|cau&s;e con&s;cious to them&s;elves of having incurred the re&s;entment of queen I&s;a|bel, who was a prince&s;s of that country, and had been in&s;ulted by them upon many occa&s;ions. At length Charles &s;ent a peremptory citation, fixing a day for Edward's coming to Amiens, and &s;erved upon him a monition drawn by a public-notary, as a previous &s;tep to the confi&s;cation of Guienne, in ca&s;e the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. C$. 1$$$.</NOTE> &s;ummons &s;hould be &s;till di&s;regarded. The king being perplexed in his own mind, had recour&s;e to the advice of parliament, which being called in the be|ginning of Lent at We&s;tmin&s;ter, unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved that he &s;hould not go over in per&s;on, but &s;end amba&s;&s;adors to demand further re&s;pite of homage. Adam Orleton bi&s;hop of Hereford being called to account in this a&s;&s;embly, for &s;ending &s;uccours to Roger de Mortimer, and other barons, in the beginning of the late rebellion, refu&s;ed to an&s;wer without leave of the archbi&s;hop and the prelates, who interceded in his behalf; and finding the council bent upon bringing him to his trial, carried him out of the court in triumph, threatening all their oppo&s;ers with excommunication. The bi&s;hops of Bath and Lincoln had likewi&s;e been concerned in the revolt, and Edward de&s;ired the pope to de|prive them of their &s;ees on that account; but his holine&s;s refu&s;ed to proceed again&s;t them, becau&s;e trea&s;on was not a canonical offence. Edward &s;eeing no hopes of redre&s;s from the court of Rome, and the eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction, re|&s;olved to make u&s;e of his own prerogative in the ca&s;e of Orleton. A jury being impannelled at Hereford, found him guilty of all the crimes laid to his charge; then the king &s;eized his temporalities, and left the church to take cognizance of his per&s;on. It was in this parliament that the king prevailed upon the no|bility<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wal&s;ingham Rymer.</NOTE> to agree that the lands of the Templars &s;hould be given to the knights of St. John of Jeru&s;alem.</P>

<P>The earl of Kent and the archbi&s;hop of Dublin were &s;ent amba&s;|&s;adors to the court of France, where they met with a very honourable recep|tion; though Charles would not grant the reque&s;t of Edward, until &s;atisfaction &s;hould be made for &s;ome injuries he pretended to have &s;u&s;tained in Guienne. He had purcha&s;ed a &s;pot of ground in the Agenois, and built a town, the in|habitants of which, though under the juri&s;diction of that dutchy, paid no re|gard to the officers of Edward, confiding in the favour of the French king, to whom appeal lay as lord paramount of the country. Ralph lord Ba&s;&s;et of Drayton, &s;ene&s;chal of the dutchy, having for &s;ome time bore with their in&s;o|lence and di&s;obedience, at length marched again&s;t them with a body of forces, routed the inhabitants, and de&s;troyed the town. He was &s;ummoned before the parliament of Paris to an&s;wer for his conduct, and refu&s;ing to appear, bani&s;hed from France for ever. Without regarding this &s;entence, he took up his quarters in the &s;trong ca&s;tle of Montpezat, which was likewi&s;e the &s;ubject of a di&s;pute between the kings of France and England; and expecting to be attacked, prepared for a vigorous defence. Charles in&s;i&s;ted upon Ralph's being delivered up to him, together with the ca&s;tle, as a &s;atisfaction for the damage he had received; and the earl of Kent acquie&s;ced in his demand: but the archbi&s;hop refu&s;ed his a&s;&s;ent, until his maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure &s;hould be known; and while me&s;&s;engers were di&s;patched to England for that purpo&s;e, the earl proceeded to Guienne, to put that country in a po&s;ture of defence. Edward refu&s;ed to deliver up his officers, and Guienne was invaded by a great army under
<PB N="667" REF="6760">
the command of Charles count de Valois. All the Engli&s;h in France were &s;eized, with their &s;hips and effects, and a fleet was equipped for a de&s;cent upon England. Edward re&s;olved to &s;end over a body of troops for the defence of Guienne, and &s;ummoned all per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of forty pounds a year to come and receive the order of knighthood, that he might rai&s;e &s;ome money towards defraying the expence of this expedition. He retaliated the conduct of Charles, in confi&s;cat|ing all the &s;hips and effects belonging to the French in England, re&s;umed all the lands, and the whole county of Cornwal, which he had granted to his queen, that &s;he might not have an opportunity to favour the de&s;cent of her countrymen, to which the D'E&s;pen&s;ers affected to in&s;inuate that &s;he was very well di&s;po&s;ed. With great difficulty he equipped a fleet, on board of which he &s;ent a reinforcement of &s;even thou&s;and men for the defence of Guienne, under the command of the lords Segrave and Fitzwarin; but before they ar|rived, the count de Valois had &s;ubdued the Agenois, and demoli&s;hed the ca&s;tle of Montpezat: La Reole &s;urrendered about the latter end of September, and Puimerol and Penne were inve&s;ted; when a truce was concluded till Ea&s;ter, and afterwards prolonged to a month after Mid&s;ummer in the following year. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Du Tillet.</NOTE></P>

<P>This di&s;graceful &s;u&s;pen&s;ion and capitulation of La Reole were tran&s;acted by the earl of Kent, contrary to the &s;en&s;e of all the officers in the army; and are &s;aid to have been concluded at the in&s;tigation of the archbi&s;hop of Dublin, who was a &s;ecret enemy of the D'E&s;pen&s;ers. Indeed the rupture between the two crowns &s;eems to have been owing to the re&s;entment which Charles conceived again&s;t the&s;e favourites, for their arrogance and enmity to queen I&s;abel, from whom they alienated the king's affection, taking every op|portunity to mortify her pride and thwart her intere&s;t. Edward, notwith&s;tand|ing the truce, continued to levy troops, and make other preparations for main|taining the war, which he re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute in per&s;on: he gave public notice of his intention to cro&s;s the &s;ea in the beginning of Lent; but by the advice of parliament deferred his voyage till the A&s;cen&s;ion; and before that day arrived a treaty of peace was brought upon the carpet. The pope inter|po&s;ed his good offices, employing the archbi&s;hop of Vienne, and the bi&s;hop of Orange, to mediate an accommodation between the two monarchs: and the bi&s;hop of Norwich and Winche&s;ter, with the earl of Richmond and lord Beau|mont, were &s;ent to Paris as deputies to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the conferences. Charles &s;tarted a number of difficulties; but at the &s;ame time hinted that all ob|&s;tacles might be removed by the pre&s;ence and interce&s;&s;ion of his &s;i&s;ter queen I&s;abel. Both the nuncios, and even the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;adors, pre&s;&s;ed king Edward by letters to &s;end over the queen, who could not fail to bring the di&s;pute to an happy i&s;&s;ue: he agreed to the propo&s;al, and I&s;abel embarked in March for her native country, where &s;he re&s;olved to continue until the two favourites &s;hould be di&s;carded. Her hu&s;band, however, reaped but little be|nefit<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. We&s;t.</NOTE> from her interpo&s;ition; for in May a peace was concluded, on conditions<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

It was &s;ti|pulated that Charles &s;hould be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Guienne, until Edward &s;hould have done homage at Beauvais on the twenty-ninth day of Augu&s;t; and then it &s;hould be re&s;tored to the right owner: that Edward &s;hould &s;ubmit to the deci&s;ion of the court of peers in France, in the di&s;pute about the lands of Guienne, which were occupied by Charles: that the pri&s;oners on both &s;ides

The&s;e apprehen&s;ions had &s;uch an $word$ upon his imagination, that when Edward called a council at Winche&s;$er, to de$$berate upon this article of the treaty, he could not help exclaiming, <Q>&startq;Who&s;oever &s;hall advi&s;e the king to tru&s;t him&s;elf among his ene|mies, is a notorious traitor.&endq;</Q> This declaration deterred the coun&s;ellors from giving their opinions on the &s;ubject; and for this rea&s;on a parliament was con|voke$ at London, where the members unanimou&s;ly agreed in advi&s;ing his maje&s;ty to comply with that article; as no other expedient occurred, by which the total reduction of Guienne could be prevented. He therefore declared his re&s;olution to cro&s;s the &s;ea, and appoint prince Edward regent in his ab&s;ence. He removed the bi&s;hop of Exeter from the po&s;t of trea&s;urer, which he be|&s;towed upon William de Melton archbi&s;hop or York, and &s;et out for Dover, where he purpo&s;ed to take &s;hipping. Being taken ill at the abbey of Langton, he di&s;patched me&s;&s;engers to inform the king of France of his indi&s;po&s;ition, and de&s;ire that another day might be fixed for the homage; and in the mean time letters of protection and &s;afe-conduct were granted by Charles to the nobility and gentry of his retinue. The favourite was not more aver&s;e to the king's voyage than the queen her&s;elf, who fore&s;aw, that if Edward &s;hould come to France, &s;he could not avoid returning with him to England; and by this time her affections were &s;o entirely alienated from her hu&s;band, that &s;he could not conceive any misfortune greater than that of living with him as his wife: be&s;ides, her re&s;entment again&s;t the D'E&s;pen&s;ers was implacable; and while they continued in favour, &s;he had no rea&s;on to expect either comfort or convenience at the court of England. She had already laid a plan for their de&s;truction, in concert with the Engli&s;h refugees at Paris; and, among others, carried on &s;uch an intimacy with Roger Mortimer, as gave ri&s;e to reports that were pre|judicial to her reputation. It was by her &s;ugge&s;tion that her brother Charles &s;ent over an in&s;trument to Edward, declaring, that if he would make a con|veyance of his lands in France to his own &s;on, and &s;end him over to do ho|mage, he would re&s;t as well &s;atisfied as if it had been done by the father in per&s;on. This propo&s;al met with a favourable reception from the D'E&s;pen&s;ers, who were glad of any expedient to prevent the king's going abroad. And their advice being &s;econded by the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and &s;ome prelates that were in attendance, and perhaps favoured the queen's de&s;igns, the king made a formal conveyance of Ponthieu and Guienne to his &s;on Edward, who embarked at Dover, under the tuition of the bi&s;hop of Exeter, with a large<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

<P>Edward, in the whole cour&s;e of his reign, had never taken &s;uch an imprudent &s;tep as this, of parting with the heir apparent of his crown. Young Edward was &s;o care&s;&s;ed by his mother, that &s;he gained a total a&s;cendency over his affections: &s;he intere&s;ted him in her quarrel, and he refu&s;ed to return when

his father &s;ent for him to England. The queen declared &s;he would never re|vi&s;it the i&s;land until Hugh D'E&s;pen&s;er &s;hould be bani&s;hed the kingdom with di&s;grace. The revenues of the countries conveyed to her &s;on, not only &s;up|plied her with the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, but even enabled her, with the con|junction of young Edward, to take mea&s;ures for an inva&s;ion of England, which &s;he boa&s;ted of having planned in concert with the Lanca&s;trian faction, who were ready to take arms in her favour. Her behaviour on this occa&s;ion was the more &s;urpri&s;ing to Edward, as &s;he had parted &s;eemingly in friend&s;hip with the favourite, and even writ kind letters to him &s;ince her arrival in France. The king &s;ollicited her in the mo&s;t earne&s;t manner to come home, and promi&s;ed that her happine&s;s &s;hould be con&s;ulted in every re&s;pect. He intreated the king of France to in&s;i&s;t upon her leaving his dominions, and commanded his &s;on to return upon his duty and allegiance. The&s;e intreaties proving ineffectual, he &s;ummoned a parliament to meet at We&s;tmin&s;ter, and a&s;&s;i&s;t him with their advice in this perplexing &s;ituation; there it was re&s;olved that all the bi&s;hops &s;hould write &s;eparately to the queen, exhorting her to return to her hu&s;band, and remove the occa&s;ion of &s;candal, which &s;he had given by her fa|miliarity with Mortimer, and connexions with the fugitive rebels, who had endeavoured to &s;ubvert the con&s;titution. Edward him&s;elf renewed his impor|tunities and expo&s;tulation with her and her brother Charles, and ordered the bi&s;hop of Exeter to bring back the prince with all convenient expedition. I&s;abel pretended that her life was in danger from the machinations of D'E&s;pen&s;er; Charles ob&s;erved that decency and natural affection would not permit him to drive his &s;i&s;ter out of his dominions; and young Edward refu&s;ed to leave his mother in her affliction. The bi&s;hop of Exeter pre&s;&s;ed his pupil to return; and, from his attachment to the king, was &s;o odious to I&s;abel and her favourite Mortimer, who could not conceal their corre&s;pondence from his notice, that they re&s;olved to frighten him out of the kingdom of France. For that pur|po&s;e a &s;ham con&s;piracy was formed again&s;t his life. They took care that he &s;hould be apprized of the pretended de&s;ign, which the hone&s;t prelate no &s;ooner under&s;tood, than he retreated with equal &s;ecrecy and di&s;patch to England, where he made the king acquainted with the cabals and ho&s;tile intention of I&s;abel and the Engli&s;h refugees. Edward thinking it was high time to pre|pare for this impending &s;torm, i&s;&s;ued orders for &s;earching all pa&s;&s;engers at the &s;ea-ports, as well as for examining &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons all over the kingdom. The wardens of the Cinque-Ports and the admirals were directed to receive the queen and prince with due honour, &s;hould they come over in the ve&s;&s;els which the king had provided for their pa&s;&s;age; but to treat all their adherents as ene|mies of the kingdom, &s;hould they attempt to make a de&s;cent in a ho&s;tile man|ner. Proclamations were &s;ent into every county, ordering all per&s;ons to be ready to march again&s;t foreigners wherever they &s;hould land in the kingdom: they were enjoined to apprehend the emi&s;&s;aries of the queen's faction, and to put in execution the &s;tatute of Edward I. again&s;t &s;uch as &s;pread fal&s;e reports, tending to create di&s;cord between the king and the people. The king wrote a letter to the pope, de&s;iring his holine&s;s would not grant a di&s;pen&s;ation for the marriage of his &s;on Edward without his con&s;ent, but exert his influence in per&s;uading the king of France to &s;end the queen and prince of England out of his dominions; and la&s;tly, he employed Arnaud Caillon, a Ga&s;con nobleman, to treat in his name with the nobility of that province, that the queen &s;hould receive no &s;uccours from Guienne. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ad.

<P>While Edward was bu&s;ied in taking the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary precautions, reports were indu&s;triou&s;ly circulated to his prejudice, on the continent. He was &s;aid to have denounced a &s;entence of bani&s;hment again&s;t the queen and prince; and it was afterwards rumoured in France, that he had cau&s;ed all the &s;ubjects of that crown, who were in England, to be &s;eized and put to death. Con&s;idering that his own &s;on was at that time in the French court, and &s;uch a number of his trading people in that kingdom, Charles could not po&s;&s;ibly give credit to &s;uch an improbable a&s;per&s;ion: yet, on this pretence, he ordered all the Engli&s;h &s;ubjects in France to be apprehended, to the number of three|&s;core thou&s;and, confi&s;cated their effects, and renewed ho&s;tilities in Guienne. Perhaps the report was &s;pread by his own emi&s;&s;aries, that he might have a handle for invading Guienne and di&s;t$e&s;&s;ing the king of England; &s;o as that he might be the le&s;s able to oppo&s;e the de&s;cent which his &s;i&s;ter had projected. Edward being informed of the&s;e acts of violence, ordered his military tenants to rendezvous at Portche&s;ter, in order to embark for Guienne; and in the mean time &s;eized all the French &s;ubjects who were in England, together with their &s;hips and effects. This expedition, however, did not take effect, becau&s;e the king found it nece&s;&s;ary to employ all his power in the defence of England, which the queen threatened to invade. The pope re&s;enting this behaviour of Charles, who had infringed the peace which he had mediated, and &s;candalized at the familiarity which openly &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between his &s;i&s;ter I&s;abel and Mortimer, under the countenance of the French court, exhorted Charles to &s;end his &s;i&s;ter and her &s;on back to England; and even threatened him with excommunication, &s;hould he per&s;i&s;t in detaining them, contrary to all the rules of decency and good faith.</P>

<P>This declaration had &s;uch effect upon Charles and his council, that they would no longer openly countenance I&s;abel and her paramour. It was even debated among the peers, whether or not they &s;hould cau&s;e her and her &s;on to be apprehended and conveyed to king Edward; and her brother &s;ent her a copy of the pope's letter, with an order to leave his dominions without delay. Notwith&s;tanding this affectation of candour, and obedience to his ho|line&s;s, he certainly employed his intere&s;t clande&s;tinely in her behalf; and it was at the de&s;ire of Charles that Robert d'Artois treated with William count of Hainault and Holland, for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to I&s;abel queen of England. That prince's dominions lay very convenient for an embarkation; and his concurrence was &s;ecured by a contract of marriage between young Edward and one of his daughters. The articles of this alliance being &s;ettled, I&s;abel and the prince &s;et out from Paris for Ponthieu; from whence &s;he repaired to Valenciennes, where &s;he was very cordially received by count William and his brother John, who dedicated his life to her &s;ervice, and afterwards accompanied her to England; and as Edward, who was then ju&s;t turned of fourteen, &s;eemed captivated by the count's &s;econd daughter Philippa, the young couple were affianced, though the nuptials were not con&s;ummated. A body of forces being a&s;&s;embled, and a fleet of tran&s;ports equipped, the queen and her &s;on embarked at Dordrecht, accompanied by the earl of Kent, who had by this time declared in her favour; Roger de Mortimer, with &s;ome of the lords of her faction; and John de Beaumont, brother to count William, at the head of three thou&s;and men<NOTE PLACE="marg">W$$$ingham.</NOTE> at arms, be&s;ides a good number of infantry$ and after a dangerous pa&s;&s;age ar|rived at Orewell, near Walton in Suffolk, about the latter end of September$

The earl of Kent was not only fir&s;t cou&s;in to the queen, by his mother Margaret of France, but he had lately married the &s;i&s;ter of Thomas lord Wake, who had been a &s;taunch adherent of Lanca&s;ter. Kent's brother, Thomas earl of Norfork and Mare&s;chal, e&s;pou&s;ed the &s;ame cau&s;e for the &s;ame rea&s;on; and John de Bretagne earl of Richmond, who had been employed to negotiate the peace at the court of France, was debauched from his allegiance by the artifices of Charles and the care&s;&s;es of I&s;abel. This was likewi&s;e the ca&s;e with Henry lord Beau|mont, who owed his whole fortune to the bounty of the king and his father. The fir&s;t refu&s;ed to return, and his lands were &s;eized; the other came back, in order to promote the queen's intere&s;t in England; but his proceedings being di&s;covered, he was arre&s;ted and impri&s;oned in the ca&s;tle of Wallingford. All<NOTE PLACE="marg">Knyghton.</NOTE> tho&s;e who had formerly joined in the faction of Lanca&s;ter, were now ready to embark in the queen's undertaking; and all the relations of tho&s;e who had been put to death and forfeited for that rebellion, were eager to &s;eize this op|portunity of retrieving the honours and e&s;tates which their families had lo&s;t. The archbi&s;hop of Canterbury and the majority of the prelates were in her in|tere&s;t, as well as every individual who hated the younger D'E&s;pen&s;er, who&s;e in&s;olence, cruelty, and avarice, had incen&s;ed the whole nation. All the great earls abandoned Edward, except tho&s;e of Surrey and Arundel; the fir&s;t of whom was now in the north, guarding the Scotti&s;h Marches: the king him&s;elf was weak, indolent, and timorous, di&s;pirited by this defection of his nobles, and di&s;re|garded not only by his &s;ubjects in general, but even by his own officers and &s;ervants, who neglected his orders, and allowed the queen to land without mole&s;tation. She was immediately joined by the earl of Norfolk, and the bi&s;hops of Norwich, Ely, and Lincoln, with their followers; and at the &s;ame time &s;he received a &s;um of money from the metropolitan for the payment of her army. The earl of Lei|ce&s;ter, brother of the late earl of Lanca&s;ter, and other noblemen of his party, a&s;|&s;embled their va&s;&s;als, and repaired to her &s;tandard with a very &s;trong reinforce|ment. The pre&s;ence and concurrence of the prince was worth a whole army to the queen, becau&s;e it removed the terror of forfeitures, and afforded on op|portunity for enterpri&s;ing people to recommend them&s;elves to his future favour, when he &s;hould a&s;cend the throne. When the king heard of I&s;abel's landing, he i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, offering a reward of one thou&s;and pounds for Morti|mer's head; and ordered his liege &s;ubjects to fall upon and de&s;troy the foreign|ers by whom that traitor was attended. He granted commi&s;&s;ions to array men in Kent, and all the counties in England; and Robert de Wateville was em|powered to rai&s;e all the forces of E&s;&s;ex, and that country which con&s;tituted the old kingdom of the Ea&s;t Angles. But he betrayed his tru&s;t, and joining the prince with the troops he could a&s;&s;emble, became one of the queen's mo&s;t active parti&s;ans. I&s;abel exerted her&s;elf with great indu&s;try in writing circular letters to the noblemen and cities of the kingdom, and publi&s;hing manife&s;tos, in which &s;he declared that no injury &s;hould be offered to any per&s;on but the D'E&s;pen&s;ers, the chancellor Baldock, and their abettors, who were the &s;ource of the pre&s;ent di&s;turbances; that &s;he was come to ea&s;e the people of their burdens, a&s;&s;ert the liberties of the church, and reform the admini&s;tration. The bi&s;hops employed their whole influence in the &s;upport of her cau&s;e; they magnified the number of the forces, and the quality of the per&s;ons &s;ent over by the king of France to defend the rights of his &s;i&s;ter. A report was in|du&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread over all the kingdom, that the pope had ab&s;olved the &s;ubjects

<P>When he received the fir&s;t intelligence of the queen's arrival, he demanded a &s;upply of men from the city of London; but the magi&s;trates evaded his propo&s;al by a general profe&s;&s;ion of loyalty, and giving him to un|der&s;tand, that they &s;hould act contrary to their privileges, in &s;erving without the walls of the city, except for a &s;ingle day, &s;o as that they might return by &s;un-&s;et. Edward concluding from this dry, ambiguous an&s;wer, that he had nothing to expect from that quarter, and that his per&s;on was not &s;afe among people who had never been well affected to his family, retired to Bri&s;tol, in hope of finding more zeal and attachment among the inhabitants of that city and neighbourhood. He left his younger &s;on, and his niece, the wife of the younger D'E&s;pen&s;er, in the Tower, under the care of Walter Stapledon bi&s;hop of $xeter, who, together with tho&s;e of London and Winche&s;ter, had publi&s;hed at St. Paul's the pope's bull of excommunication again&s;t all who invaded the realm, or di&s;turbed the peace of the nation. Immediately after the king's de|parture from London, the populace ran to arms, &s;eized the mayor, who was attached to Edward, and compelled him to authori&s;e their proceedings; then they bound them&s;elves by an a&s;&s;ociation to kill and de&s;troy all per&s;ons, without di&s;tinction of rank and circum&s;tance, who &s;hould oppo&s;e the queen, or intrench upon the liberties of the city. Having formed this confederacy, they appre|hended John Mar&s;hal, who enjoyed an office under D'E&s;pen&s;er, put him to death, and plundered his effects. Then they pillaged the hou&s;e of the bi&s;hop of Exeter, who at that time was ju&s;t returning from his &s;eat in the country. Being informed of the tumult, he proceeded towards St. Paul's, in hope of reaching the Tower, but was &s;eized by the way, dragged violently from his hor&s;e, and conveyed to the great cro&s;s in Cheap&s;ide, where the furious mob &s;evered his head from his body. His nephew, with one of his attendants, un|derwent the &s;ame fate; their bodies were denied chri&s;tian burial; and the rioters &s;ent the bi&s;hop's head in a pre&s;ent to the queen. Next day, they &s;urprized John de We&s;ton, governor of the Tower, relea&s;ed all the pri&s;oners, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. We&s;t. Cont. Ang.

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, the queen had marched to Wallingford, and detached the earl of Kent and John de Hainault, with the flower of her troops, in pur&s;uit of the king, who was obliged to take &s;hipping at Bri&s;tol for Wales, where he thought he &s;hould be able to rai&s;e a body of his countrymen. Hugh D'E&s;pen&s;er earl of Winche&s;ter was left with &s;ome troops to defend the town and ca&s;tle of Bri&s;tol; but his garri&s;on being di&s;affected, he was obliged in three days to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion. I&s;abel, who had been joined at Glou|ce&s;ter by the lords Piercy and Wake, and other noblemen of the Wel&s;h Marches, no &s;ooner heard of Winche&s;ter's being taken, than &s;he marched to Bri&s;tol, in order to determine the fate of that nobleman, who was by this time turned of ninety. He was brought before Sir William Tru&s;&s;el, whom &s;he ap|pointed chief ju&s;tice on this occa&s;ion; and he, in pre&s;ence of the earls of Nor|folk, Kent, and Leice&s;ter, Roger de Mortimer, the lord Wake, and others, charged Hugh D'E&s;pen&s;er with introducing a cu&s;tom of condemning people

He was for the&s;e crimes condemned to die the death of a traitor; and the &s;entence was executed with great barbarity.

<P>Mean while the unhappy king, accompanied by the younger D'E&s;pen&s;er, repaired to C$$rfilly in Glamorgan&s;hire, where he &s;ummoned his military tenants in South Wales to ri&s;e in his defence. This order producing no effect, he embarked for Ireland; but, after having been tempe&s;t-beaten a whole week by contrary winds, he was obliged to land privately at Swan&s;ey, and took refuge in the mona&s;tery of Neath. From thence he &s;ent his own nephew Edward de Bohun, fourth &s;on of the late earl of Hereford, Re&s;e ap Griffith, and two other commi&s;&s;ioners, to treat with the queen and prince Ed|ward. At this juncture he had very little to expect from a negotiation of that nature. The queen advanced with her army to Hereford, from whence &s;he detached the earl of Leice&s;ter, with &s;ome Wel&s;h noblemen, and a body of marchers, to di&s;cover the place of Edward's retreat. This ta&s;k they performed by bribing the natives, who betrayed him to his enemies: he was taken in November, with the earl of Arundel, Robert de'Baldock, and Simon de Reding, in the ca&s;tle of Lantre&s;&s;an; and Hugh D'E&s;pen&s;er was apprehended in a neigh|bouring wood. Edward was removed to Lidbury, and afterwards to the ca&s;tle of Kenilworth, where he remained all the winter, in the cu&s;tody of the earl of Leice&s;ter, who had by this time a&s;&s;umed the title of Lanca&s;ter. Bal|dock, Reding, and D'E&s;pen&s;er, were carried to Hereford, where John, Daniel, and Thomas de Muchedeure, had already been beheaded as friends to the king, who was now compelled to deliver up the great &s;eal to his &s;on, as guardian of the realm. Hugh D'E&s;pen&s;er was arraigned before the &s;ame judges who con|demned his father, and underwent the &s;ame fate with uncommon fortitude. His head was &s;ent to London, where the citizens received it with brutal triumph, and fixed it on the bridge: but his elde&s;t &s;on Hugh, about nineteen years of age, defended him&s;elf &s;o gallantly in the ca&s;tle of Caerfilly, that he obtained an honourable capitulation, by which he and the garri&s;on were &s;ecured in their per&s;ons and effects. Arundel was beheaded, Robert de Baldock, the king's chancellor and canon of St. Paul's, was claimed as an eccle&s;ia&s;tic by the bi&s;hop of Hereford, who conveyed him to his own hou&s;e, near Old Fi&s;h-&s;treet-hill in London, from whence he was dragged by the bailiffs and populace, and lodged in Newgate, where he died in great mi&s;ery. The multitude was by this time become bloody and de&s;perate. They plundered the trea&s;ure belong|ing to the chancellor, the earl of Arundel, and a company of merchants called the Bardi, who acted as bankers to Hugh D'E&s;pen&s;er: Anthony D'E&s;pagne, an opulent merchant, concerned in farming the duty upon wine, was dragged
<PB N="674" REF="6830">
barefoot to a place called Nomen&s;land, where he was beheaded by the licentious $opulace. The hou&s;es of John lord Charleton, Sir William Cliff, and many others, were pillaged; the eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts were all &s;hut up, the mayor and &s;heriffs dur&s;t not $old their hu&s;tings or hear cau&s;es; the execution of ju&s;tice was totally ob$tructed: while anarchy, rapine, and murder, prevailed not only<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. W. Co$t. Wa$&s;$ngham An. Ch. 1327.</NOTE> in London, but likewi&s;e in all the great cities of the kingdom. The prince, as guardian of the kingdom, having convoked a parliament at We&s;tmin&s;ter in the king's name, the members a&s;&s;embled according to the writs, on the &s;eventh day of January. The hou&s;e was &s;urrounded by the mob of London, clamouring again&s;t the king and his adherents; and the bi&s;hop of Hereford having declared aloud, that the queen could not cohabit again with Edward, without running the mo&s;t imminent danger of her life, put the que&s;tion to the parliament, whether they would be governed by the father or the &s;on. The members were de&s;ired to con&s;ider the alternative, &s;o as to give their an&s;wer next day in the afternoon, to which the parliament was adjourned. When they met at the appointed time, the few friends of the king were &s;o intimidated by the tumults without doors, and the power of the faction within, that they dur&s;t not deliver their &s;entiments; and the &s;ame que&s;tion being repeated, it was re&s;olved that young Edward &s;hould be elevated to the throne. The lords did homage to him in con&s;equence of this re&s;olution: then he was led out into We&s;tmin&s;ter|hall, and pre&s;ented to the populace as their king: the archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury harangued the multitude on the maxim which faith, That the voice of the people is the voice of God; and the bi&s;hops of Winton and Hereford held forth to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Silence being commanded, the prince was pro|claimed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ang$. S$cr.</NOTE> king, and hymns were &s;ung to celebrate his inauguration. Some of the bi&s;hops, however, &s;crupled to take the oath of allegiance; and were forcibly con|veyed by the populace to Guildhall, where they thought proper to comply, and even &s;wear to defend and maintain the rights and privileges of the city of London. But as young Edward's authority could not be e&s;tabli&s;hed while his father con|tinued unimpeached, the queen and Mortimer re&s;olved to proceed to a formal depo&s;ition of that unfortunate monarch. Writs were i&s;&s;ued for returning eight and forty members from North and South Wales, as the repre&s;entatives of that principality; and this addition of Mortimer's creatures being made to the par|liament, the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter drew up &s;ix articles of impeachment again&s;t the king, importing that he wanted capacity to govern the realm, ina&s;much as he had been during the whole cour&s;e of his reign mi&s;led by evil coun&s;ellors, to his own di&s;honour, and the prejudice of the church and people, without giving ear to the advice of the greate&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t men of the kingdom: that he employed his time in pur&s;uits unworthy of his character, and neglected the affairs of the admini&s;tration: that by his mi&s;conduct he lo&s;t the kingdom of Scotland, together with lands and territories in Ga&s;cony and Ireland: that he di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the holy church, by pro&s;ecuting and impri&s;oning churchmen: and that he cau&s;ed many noblemen of the land to be impri&s;oned, bani&s;hed, di&s;|herited, and put to ignominious death: that, in&s;tigated by evil coun&s;el and his own avarice, he had broke his coronation-oath: that he abandoned his people; and did as much as in him lay to ruin the kingdom: and that the&s;e truths being notorious, he was altogether incorrigible, and therefore ought to be de|po&s;ed. The&s;e articles being read in pre&s;ence of the prince, &s;eated on the throne, it was re&s;olved that young Edward &s;hould a&s;&s;ume the regal power; and that

<P>When this vote pa&s;&s;ed, the queen acted an unworthy farce, in affecting to weep and wail, and even to &s;woon at the news of her hu&s;band's depo&s;ition; and young Edward was tutored to declare, that he would not a&s;|&s;ume the royal authority without his father's con&s;ent. On pretence of obviating this objection, as well as to give a kind of &s;anction to their irregular proceedings, the parliament deputed three bi&s;hops, two earls, the &s;ame number of barons, abbots, and ju&s;tices, with &s;ome repre&s;entatives of counties and boroughs, to go and notify their re&s;olution to the king at Kenilworth. The three prelates vi&s;ited him before the re&s;t, and after warm profe&s;&s;ions of regard and attach|ment, exhorted him to make a voluntary re&s;ignation of the crown: they a&s;&s;ured him of the mo&s;t honourable treatment, in ca&s;e he would re&s;ign, and gave him to under&s;tand that his refu&s;al would be attended with the wor&s;t con&s;equences to his family; for in that ca&s;e the parliament were re&s;olved to &s;et the crown on the head of a &s;tranger. The weak and irre&s;olute Edward &s;uffered him&s;elf to be per&s;uaded by their remon&s;trance, and complied with the propo&s;al; yet when the deputies entered his apartment, he was &s;o much affected with his own di&s;|grace, that he would have dropped down in a &s;woon had not he been &s;up|ported by his attendants. He &s;oon recollected his &s;pirits, however; and pro|fe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf deeply afflicted with the reflection of what his people had &s;uf|fered by his mi&s;conduct, for which he a&s;ked pardon of all pre&s;ent; but &s;eeing what was pa&s;t could not be recalled, he &s;aid all he could do was to thank them for &s;uffering his crown to de&s;cend upon the head of his elde&s;t &s;on. Then he formally &s;urrendered the regalia, which had been brought thith$$ for that pur|po&s;e; and William Truf&s;el, who acted as procurator for the parliament, did, in their name, renounce the homage and fealty they had &s;worn to Edward, de|claring that they would not hold any thing of him as king, nor pay him any further allegiance. The deputies having made a report of this tran&s;action at<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wal&s;ingham.</NOTE> their return to parliament, the queen pretended to be con&s;oled, and the prince con|&s;ented to his own elevation. The new king's peace and acce&s;&s;ion were proclaimed according to cu&s;tom, through all England: he was knighted by John de Hainault, and crowned on Sunday the fir&s;t of February, in We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey, by Wal|ter archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, in pre&s;ence of &s;even bi&s;hops, and almo&s;t all the nobility of the kingdom.</P>

<P>Immediately after the coronation a petition was pre&s;ented to par|liament, in behalf of all who had been concerned in the rebellion of Lan|ca&s;ter, praying that all &s;entences of bani&s;hment, outlawry, fines, ran&s;oms, or penalties, denounced again&s;t them, &s;hould be repealed, and that they &s;hould be re&s;tored to their forfeited e&s;tates. Their prayer was immediately granted, together with a general amne&s;ty for all offences committed by the queen's ad|herents, to the day of the coronation. The queen and Mortimer, not &s;atisfied with having deprived Edward of his royalty, are &s;aid to have contrived a &s;cheme for taking away his life. They perceived that a great number of tho&s;e who joined them in their vengeance again&s;t the two D'E&s;pen&s;ers, had no &s;u&s;|picion of their de&s;ign to depo&s;e the king, and con&s;equently were di&s;&s;atisfied at that mea&s;ure. They dreaded the compa&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h, which never fails to glow even in favour of an enemy in di&s;tre&s;s: they fore&s;aw a returning tide of affection towards the unfortunate &s;on of their ever-glorious Edward$ and

they &s;u&s;pected the d$$$o&s;ition of Lanca&s;ter, who treated his royal pri&s;oner with $span$ They therefore removed him from Kenilworth to Berkeley $span$ where he was committed to the care of Sir John $span$ by whom he was alternately guarded.

As they had b$$n informed of a de&s;ign to relea&s;e the unhappy prince, formed by one Wil|$$$$ A$mer$ and Thomas Dunhed, a Dominican, he was frequently moved about in the nig$t from one ca&s;tle to another, that his friends might not know $ow to c$$$ct their endeavours for his relea&s;e; and, in the cour&s;e of tho&s;e $word$ $$gra$$ons, he was treated with the mo&s;t barbarous indignities. His per&s;ecuters had hoped that confinement, and the violence of his grief and $word$ would have put a period to his life, as his di&s;po&s;ition was fickle and impatient: but, while he continued under the care of the earl of Lanca&s;ter, he began to be reconciled to his &s;ituation, and amu&s;ed him&s;elf in compo&s;ing elegies upon his misfortunes. But this re&s;ignation, by which his health was confirmed, tending to di&s;appoint the views of his enemies, the new keepers were in&s;tructed to harra&s;s him with in&s;ults and ill u&s;age. The mi&s;creants exe|cuted this order with the mo&s;t diabolical inventions and per&s;everance. They contrived horrid noi&s;es to prevent or interrupt his natural repo&s;e: they com|pelled him to eat of the mo&s;t un&s;avoury and di&s;agreeable food: he was lodged in a cold, damp tower of Berkeley-ca&s;tle, expo&s;ed not only to the inclemencies of the weather, but al&s;o to the intolerable &s;tench of putrid carca&s;&s;es, piled upon the roof of his chamber with a view to annoy his &s;en&s;e of &s;melling: the $$$erable apartment in which he lay was generally overflowed with rain-wa|ter$ and he was &s;ubjected to the mo&s;t provoking in&s;ults by &s;ervants and &s;cul|hons$ who were encouraged to treat him in that unworthy manner. All the&s;e $$$cu$&s;tances of torture and chagrin are &s;aid to have been devi&s;ed by the b$$hop of Hereford, who finding this method of proceeding le&s;s effectual than he had expected, and dreading the con&s;equences that might en&s;ue, &s;hould it be reported to young Edward, re&s;olved to anticipate &s;uch a di&s;covery by the immediate murder of the old king; for which he contrived an expedient that was executed by his two keepers on the twenty-fir&s;t day of September. About mid-night they entered his chamber, while he lay a&s;leep, and ordering the ruffians $$o attended them to hold him fa&s;t down to the bed, are &s;aid to have thru&s;t a re$-hot iron up his body, by &s;uch a conveyance as prevented any external marks of violence. They had no &s;ooner perpetrated their execrable purpo&s;e, than pre&s;uming upon the precautions they had taken to conceal the cau&s;e of his $eat$, they expo&s;ed the body to the in&s;pection of the public: but, though t$$ $word$ appeared without any wound or blemi&s;h, the mu&s;cles of his face were &s;o d$$$orted as plainly to denote the agonies he had undergone; and a number of people, even at a great di&s;tance, had heard the cries and groans which he uttered wh$$e under the torture of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e pre|&s;umptions, the body was buried without farther enquiry, in the abbey of St. Peter in Glouce&s;ter; and the regicides met with no other puni&s;hment than the<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> $et$$tation of their fellow-&s;ubjects. Thus peri&s;hed Edward II. after having a$$$ned by his &s;ufferings for all the errors of his conduct. He is &s;aid to have

re&s;embled his father in the accompli&s;hments of his per&s;on, as well as in his countenance: but in other re&s;pects he &s;eems to have inherited only the defects of his character; for he was cruel and illiberal, without his valour or capacity. He had levity, indolence, and irre&s;olution, in common with other weak princes; but the di&s;tingui&s;hing foible of his character, was that unaccountable pa&s;&s;ion for the reigning favourite, to which he &s;acrificed every other con&s;ideration of policy and convenience, and at la&s;t fell a mi&s;erable victim.
