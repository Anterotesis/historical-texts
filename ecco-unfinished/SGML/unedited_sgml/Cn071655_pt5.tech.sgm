<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the very favourable reception
which the Four former Volumes of
my Sermons have met with, both at home
and abroad, I had re&s;olved not to pre&s;ume
on offering any more to the Publick. To
this publication of another Volume, my
pre&s;ent &s;ituation gave ri&s;e. Being now, by
the infirmity of very advanced age, laid
a&s;ide from all the labours of the pulpit,
and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, of cour&s;e, more retirement
and lei&s;ure than formerly, it occurred to
me, &s;ometimes, to look back into Sermons,
mo&s;t of which had been compo&s;ed a great
many years ago, with a view to ob&s;erve
how far they agreed in the &s;train of
thought with tho&s;e which I had written
<PB N="iv" REF="4">
at a later period. In reviewing them,
pa&s;&s;ages &s;ometimes appeared which I ima|gined
might be &s;erviceable, either for ad|monition
or con&s;olation to various cla&s;&s;es
of per&s;ons; and the thought began to ari&s;e
in my mind, that by employing my pre&s;ent
lei&s;ure, as long as health allowed, in preparing
&s;ome of tho&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es for the pre&s;s, it might
be in my power to be &s;till of &s;ome u&s;e in
the world. Encouraged by this idea, I
went on to revi&s;e and correct one Sermon
after another, often making alterations and
additions, till the pre&s;ent Volume aro&s;e.</P>
<P>THOUGH the &s;ubjects of the&s;e Sermons
be different from tho&s;e which I formerly
publi&s;hed, &s;ome of the &s;ame &s;entiments and
expre&s;&s;ions may occa&s;ionally be found to be
repeated in them. This is apt to happen,
partly from that &s;imilarity of thought and
&s;tyle which will run through all the com|po&s;itions
of an Author who is not copying
<PB N="v" REF="5">
others, but writing from his own reflections;
and partly, from the coincidence of &s;ome
general topicks and allu&s;ions which recur
frequently in &s;erious di&s;cour&s;es of the prac|tical
kind. Where any in&s;tances of this
nature pre&s;ented them&s;elves to my me|mory,
I found, that without altering the
&s;train of the Sermon, I could not altogether
&s;uppre&s;s and omit them; and as it is not
often they occur, I did not think it requi&s;ite
that they &s;hould be omitted. If the &s;enti|ment,
where fir&s;t introduced, was in any
degree u&s;eful or important, the renewal of
it, when brought forth under &s;ome different
form, enlarged perhaps, or abridged, or
placed in connection with &s;ome other
topick, may be thought to &s;trengthen and
confirm the impre&s;&s;ion of it.&mdash;With re|gard
to errors or inaccuracies of any other
kind, the Author mu&s;t tru&s;t to the indul|gence
of the candid Reader.</P>

<BIBL>PROVERBS, x. 28.</BIBL>
<Q>The hope of the Righteous &s;hall be gladne&s;s;
but the expectation of the Wicked &s;hall
peri&s;h.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_ATTACHMENT to futurity has
a remarkable influence on the
operations of the human mind.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. I.</NOTE>
The pre&s;ent, whatever it be, &s;eldom en|gages
our attention &s;o much as what is to
come. Remembrance of the pa&s;t may
&s;ometimes occupy our thoughts; but what
for the mo&s;t part fills them, is the antici|pation
<PB N="2" REF="13">
of the future. The pre&s;ent is apt
to be con&s;idered as an evane&s;cent &s;cene, ju&s;t
about to pa&s;s away; and in the mid&s;t of
wi&s;hes and de&s;ires, of hopes and fears,
which all re&s;pect futurity, we may be &s;aid
to dwell. As on the&s;e the life of man is
&s;o much &s;u&s;pended, it becomes a very ma|terial
part both of wi&s;dom and of duty to
attend to any regulations by which they
may be properly conducted. For if ex|pectations
and hopes on one hand, and
fears and alarms on the other, are &s;uffered
to ari&s;e with groundle&s;s precipitancy, and
to acquire an undue a&s;cendant, it is evi|dent
that they will produce much delu&s;ion
in conduct, and often will engender much
vice and guilt. As there is a <HI>hope of the
Righteous which &s;hall be gladne&s;s,</HI> &s;o there
is <HI>an expectation of the Wicked which &s;hall
peri&s;h.</HI> The anticipations of the former,
conducted by prudence and regulated by
piety, mi&s;lead him not from his duty, and
afford him &s;atisfaction in the end. While
the expectations of the latter, ari&s;ing from
fanta&s;tic imaginary pro&s;pects, delude him
<PB N="3" REF="14">
for a while with vanity, and terminate in
mi&s;ery. It will therefore be an u&s;eful &s;ub|ject
of meditation, to con&s;ider, in a few
in&s;tances, of what we may, and of what we
may not, rea&s;onably expect from the world,
when we look forward to what is mo&s;t
likely to happen, in the ordinary cour&s;e of
human affairs.</P>
<P>I. WE are not to expect the uninter|rupted
continuance of any mea&s;ure of
health, pro&s;perity, or comfort which we
now enjoy. There is the greater rea&s;on
for beginning with this admonition, as there
is a &s;trong propen&s;ity in human nature to
imagine that what we at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;s
is always to remain. When no warnings
of any approaching change appear, we are
all inclined to look forward to futurity
with a &s;mile; and to indulge the hope that
<HI>to-morrow &s;hall be as this day</HI> and even
<HI>more abundantly.</HI> Hence, in the lives of
thoughtle&s;s men, there breaks forth &s;o much
folly and pre&s;umption, &s;o much pride and
levity, and often &s;o much impiety and con|tempt
<PB N="4" REF="15">
of religion. <HI>What is the Almighty that
we &s;hould &s;erve him? Or what profit &s;hall
we have, if we pray unto him? Our moun|tain
&s;tands &s;trong; and &s;hall never be moved.</HI></P>
<P>On the lot of &s;ome men Providence is
plea&s;ed to be&s;tow a longer continuance of
pro&s;perity than on that of others. But,
as the term of that continuance is hidden
from us, all flattering and confident ex|pectations
are without foundation. At
one period or another, it is certain that the
calm is to be troubled, and the dark cloud
is to ari&s;e; and how &s;oon that period is to
come, you cannot tell. In your health, or
your fortune, or among your connections
and friends, be a&s;&s;ured that &s;ome trial
awaits you. For human life never &s;tands
&s;till for any long time. It is by no means
a fixed and &s;teady object, like the mountain
or the rock which you always find in the
&s;ame &s;rtuation; it is a river continually
moving and flowing. Neither is it the &s;till
and &s;mooth &s;tream which glides along with
the &s;ame con&s;tant tenor; but a river which
for a time may hold a regular cour&s;e
<PB N="5" REF="16">
within its banks, till, being interrupted by
rocks, it foams into a torrent, or, &s;woln by
foreign currents, it lays wa&s;te the neigh|bouring
plains. Amid&s;t &s;uch vici&s;&s;itudes
of time and life, who has any title to
reckon upon the future?&mdash;To faults, all are
&s;ubject; to troubles, all are expo&s;ed. As
that man is the mo&s;t virtuous who can be
charged with the fewe&s;t faults, &s;o that life
is the happie&s;t which &s;uffers the fewe&s;t
troubles. To look for entire exemption
from them is to court di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, I do not mean to hold
it forth as any precept of religion or wi&s;|dom,
that we ought always to &s;adden the
pre&s;ent hour by dwelling on the thoughts
of future di&s;appointment. What is given
us, let us chearfully enjoy, and render thanks
to Him who be&s;tows it. Virtue, con|joined
with prudence, may rea&s;onably af|ford
the pro&s;pect of good days to come.
<HI>For God giveth to a man that is good in his
fight, wi&s;dom, and knowledge, and joy</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Ecclef. ii. 26.</NOTE>. Such
<PB N="6" REF="17">
a pro&s;pect therefore he may innocently in|dulge,
if he pre&s;erve always that temper|ance
and moderation, that mode&s;ty and
humility, which become one who knows
that his &s;tate is ever in hazard of changing.
But I mean to warn tho&s;e who, giving
way to the elation of giddy hopes, lo&s;e the
command of them&s;elves, that by this in|toxication
of mind they are preparing the
way for an alteration of &s;tate; they are
pu&s;hing forward the wheels of advancing
change; they are accelerating their own
downfall. To them belongs that admoni|tion
of the wi&s;e man, would they &s;eriou&s;ly
li&s;ten to it; <HI>If a man live many years and
rejoice in them all, yet let him remember the
days of darkne&s;s, for they &s;hall be many:
all that cometh is vanity</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. xi. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>II. WE are not to expect, from our in|tercour&s;e
with others, all that &s;atisfaction
which we fondly wi&s;h. What the indi|vidual
either enjoys or &s;uffers by him&s;elf,
<PB N="7" REF="18">
exhibits only an imperfect view of his
condition. In the pre&s;ent &s;tate of human
affairs, we are all &s;o clo&s;ely interwoven
with one another, that a very material part
of our happine&s;s or mi&s;ery ari&s;es from the
connections which we have with tho&s;e who
are around us, and the relations in which
we &s;tand to them. The&s;e, therefore, open
a field within which our wi&s;hes and expec|tations
find an ample range. One of the
fir&s;t objects of wi&s;h to every one, is to main|tain
a proper place and rank in &s;ociety;
not to fall behind his equals; but rather,
if he can, to &s;urpa&s;s them, &s;o as to com|mand
con&s;ideration and re&s;pect from his
neighbours. This, among the vain and
ambitious, is always the favourite aim.
With them it ari&s;es to immoderate expecta|tions,
founded on their &s;uppo&s;ed talents
and imagined merits. But perhaps, in the
hearts of all men, &s;ome wi&s;h of this nature
lurks; &s;ome wi&s;h not to be overlooked in
the crowd, but to attain that degree of
di&s;tinction which they conceive they might
rea&s;onably claim.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="19">
With re&s;pect to claims of this &s;ort it is
to be apprehended that, among per&s;ons of
all characters and de&s;criptions, many an
<HI>expectation mu&s;t peri&s;h,</HI> and many a di&s;ap|pointment
be endured. For &s;uch is the
power which the &s;ophi&s;try of &s;elf-love
exerci&s;es over us, that almo&s;t every one
may be a&s;&s;ured that he mea&s;ures him&s;elf
by a deceitful &s;cale; that he places the
point of his own merit at a higher degree
than others will admit that it reaches. All
are jealous of the high preten&s;ions of others.
He who &s;u&s;pects a rival in his neighbour,
will &s;tudy every method of bringing him
down to what he takes to be his proper
level; nay, often of depreciating him be|low
it. Hence the endle&s;s mortifications
which the vain and &s;elf-conceited &s;uffer.
Hence the &s;pleen and re&s;entment which is
&s;o often breaking forth, di&s;turbing the peace
of &s;ociety, and involving it in crimes and
mi&s;eries. Were expectations more mo|derate,
they would be more favourably re|ceived.
Did we more rarely attempt to
pu&s;h our&s;elves into notice the world would
<PB N="9" REF="20">
more readily allow us, nay &s;ometimes a&s;&s;i&s;t
us, to come forward. Were we content
&s;ometimes to remain in the &s;hade, we
would with more advantage come forth
into &s;un&s;hine, and find the brightne&s;s in|terrupted
by fewer clouds.</P>
<P>In the clo&s;er connexions which men
form of intimate friend&s;hip and dome&s;tic
life, there is &s;till more rea&s;on for due mo|deration
in our expectations and hopes.
For the nearer that men approach to each
other, the more numerous the points of
contact are in which they touch, the greater
indeed will be the plea&s;ure of perfect &s;ym|phony
and agreements of feelings; but, at
the &s;ame time, if any har&s;h and repul&s;ive
&s;en&s;ations take place, the more grating and
pungent will be the pain.&mdash;If you look for
a friend, or a partner of your life, in who&s;e
temper there is not to be found the lea&s;t
inequality, who upon no occa&s;ion is to be
hurt or offended by any frailties you di&s;|cover,
who&s;e feelings are to harmonize in
every trifle with yours, who&s;e countenance
is always to reflect the image of your own,
you look for a plea&s;ing phantom, which is
<PB N="10" REF="21">
never, or, at mo&s;t, very rarely, to be found;
and if di&s;appointment &s;our your mind, you
have your own folly to blame. You
ought to have con&s;idered that you live in
a region of human infirmity, where every
one has imperfections and failings. You
a&s;&s;uredly have your own. What rea&s;on had
you to imagine, that the per&s;on whom
you love and e&s;teem was to be the only
exception from the common fate? Here,
if any where, it becomes you to overlook
and forbear; and never to allow &s;mall fail|ings
to dwell on your attention &s;o much as
to deface the whole of an amiable cha|racter.
From trifling mi&s;under&s;tandings
ari&s;ing from the mo&s;t frivolous cau&s;es,
&s;prings much of the mi&s;ery of &s;ocial and
dome&s;tic life. Hence is bla&s;ted many a
plea&s;ing blo&s;&s;om of hope; and many an
<HI>expectation,</HI> which once promi&s;ed unbroken
harmony, is left <HI>to peri&s;h.</HI> I &s;hall only
mention,</P>
<P>III. ANOTHER in&s;tance of what we are
not to expect in the ordinary cour&s;e of
human affairs; that is, con&s;tant gratitude
<PB N="11" REF="22">
from tho&s;e whom we have mo&s;t obliged
and &s;erved. I am far from &s;aying that
gratitude is an unknown, or even a rare
virtue among mankind; I think not &s;o
ill of human nature. On the contrary, it
is my belief, that grateful &s;en&s;ations for
favours received are very generally felt; and,
when no &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion counteracts tho&s;e
&s;en&s;ations, that grateful returns are gene|rally
intended, and often are actually made.
But then, our expectations of proper re|turns
mu&s;t be kept within moderate
bounds. We mu&s;t not carry them &s;o far
as to imagine, that gratitude is to produce
unlimited compliance with every de&s;ire
which we chu&s;e to indulge; or that they
whom we have obliged will altogether
de&s;ert their own intere&s;t for the &s;ake of
their benefactors. Many circum&s;tances, it
is to be remembered, tend to cool the grate|ful
emotion. Time always deadens the
memory of benefits. Sometimes they are
con&s;idered as having been fully recom|pen&s;ed,
and the debt of gratitude repaid.
As benefits conferred are often under-rated
<PB N="12" REF="23">
by tho&s;e who receive them, &s;o they are
&s;ometimes over-valued by tho&s;e who con|fer
them. On per&s;ons of light and carele&s;s
minds, no moral &s;entiment makes any deep
impre&s;&s;ion; with &s;uch, the remembrance
of both benefit and benefactor is apt to
pa&s;s &s;peedily away. With the proud &s;pirit,
which claims every thing as its due, gra|titude
is in a great mea&s;ure incompatible.
From per&s;ons of this character, we are
never to expect it; and indeed from per|&s;ons
of any character we are not to be
&s;urpri&s;ed, if, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the
world, it ri&s;es not &s;o high as we thought
we had rea&s;on to hope.</P>
<P>HAVING thus &s;hown in &s;ome material
in&s;tances what we have no rea&s;on to ex|pect
in the ordinary cour&s;e of human af|fairs,
I turn next to the brighter &s;ide of
the &s;ubject, and &s;hall &s;how what a wi&s;e
and good man may rea&s;onably expect from
human life. <HI>His hope &s;hall be gladne&s;s,</HI> al|though
<HI>the expectation of fools &s;hall peri&s;h.</HI></P>

1. WHATEVER cour&s;e the affairs of the
world take, he may ju&s;tly hope to enjoy
peace of mind. I am &s;en&s;ible that by the
&s;ceptic and the pro&s;ligate, this will be held
as a very incon&s;iderable object of expecta|tion
or hope. To them every enjoyment
which is of mental and intellectual nature
appears of &s;mall value. Give them af|fluent
fortune and flouri&s;hing health, and
they account them&s;elves &s;ure of felicity.
But to the&s;e very per&s;ons I appeal, whe|ther
there have not been many occa&s;ions,
when the want of a peaceful and &s;elf|approving
mind has not bla&s;ted all the en|joyments
they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed? In the mid&s;t of
the pomp and luxuries of life, have they
never experienced the pangs of a <HI>wounded
&s;pirit?</HI> Have they never felt what it was
to be tormented by the &s;en&s;e of pa&s;t follies,
and to be &s;tung with the reproaches of an
angry con&s;cience? Dare they &s;ay that in
the mid&s;t of tho&s;e feelings they were happy?
Will they not be con&s;trained to own, that
in &s;uch moments of inward pain, they
would willingly have exchanged conditions
<PB N="14" REF="25">
with an innocent pea&s;ant? Let them then
learn the value of that object of hope
which they affect to contemn, by recol|lecting
what they have &s;uffered from the
want of it.&mdash;A&s;&s;uredly, the peace of an
approving con&s;cience is one of the chief
ingredients of human happine&s;s; one of
the mo&s;t grateful of all &s;en&s;ations to the
heart of man: provided always that this
&s;elf-approbation re&s;t upon proper grounds;
that it be tempered with due humility, and
regulated by Chri&s;tian faith; that it never
&s;well into an arrogant opinion of our vir|tue,
or into confidence in our own merits,
as if they were &s;ufficient, without any
higher intervention, to render us acceptable
to God.</P>
<P>He, who&s;e &s;tudy it is to pre&s;erve a con|&s;cience
void of offence towards God and
man, who upon ju&s;t principles can be &s;a|tisfied
that he is walking in the path which
was appointed by God, will have, in every
&s;tate of fortune, a ground of hope which
may ju&s;tly be denominated <HI>gladne&s;s;</HI> for
peace of mind will not for&s;ake him. Let
<PB N="15" REF="26">
the world vibrate around him as it will,
and repeat all its vici&s;&s;itudes, he will not
be &s;haken by them. He has always &s;ome|what
to re&s;t upon for comfort. Wrapped
up in his own integrity, he remains &s;ound
and entire within him&s;elf; and with a
firm mind awaits the coming &s;torm. <HI>He
is not afraid of evil tidings; for his heart
is fixed, tru&s;ting in the Lord</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;. cxii. 7.</NOTE>. As he can
look up to a Supreme Power with good
hope, &s;o he can look every man in the face
without unea&s;ine&s;s, when he is con&s;cious
that no man can reproach him with having
entrenched upon his neighbour's rights, or
having cau&s;ele&s;sly provoked and attacked
him. Hence, a calm mind by day, and
undi&s;turbed &s;lumbers by night. Hence,
the hope of that continued protection of
Heaven which watches over the righteous.
<HI>In the time of trouble He &s;hall hide me in

II. A GOOD man has ground to expect
that any external condition into which, in
the cour&s;e of human affairs, he may pa&s;s,
&s;hall, by means of virtue and wi&s;dom, be
rendered, if not perfectly agreeable, yet
tolerably ea&s;y to him. That di&s;tre&s;&s;es of
various kinds are &s;cattered through the life
of every mortal man, there can be no
doubt. But it is al&s;o to be remembered,
that to many di&s;tre&s;&s;es there are remedies
which it is in our power to apply; and
that with all &s;orrows &s;ome comforts are
mixed. So many loud complaints we hear
of the inequalities of fortune in the world,
that one would imagine the rich and the
great to be the only per&s;ons who had the
privilege of being happy; and that the
mean and the poor were doomed, without
exception, to be mi&s;erable. Be a&s;&s;ured,
my friends, that the inequality of real
happine&s;s is not to be mea&s;ured by the in|equality
of outward e&s;tate. When you
&s;ee the pea&s;ant chearful in his cottage, and
the labourer &s;inging in the fields, you may
di&s;cern that there is &s;ome power in the
<PB N="17" REF="28">
mind &s;uperiour to external condition; that
more depends on the man him&s;elf, than on
the &s;ituation in which the world has placed
him. Would you e&s;timate ju&s;tly the &s;um
of happine&s;s that he enjoys, or the degree
of unhappine&s;s that he feels? The que&s;|tions
you are to put, if the man be in pro&s;|perity,
are not, How much wealth does &s;uch
a man po&s;&s;e&s;s? but, How does he enjoy it?
If he be in adver&s;ity, not, What is his di&s;|tre&s;s?
but, How does he bear it?</P>
<P>Hence ari&s;es the hope to a wi&s;e and good
man of either finding, or making his &s;tate
tolerable to him&s;elf. If he be not wanting
to him&s;elf, he is never left without re|&s;ources
to a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e exertions which he
makes in his own behalf. Ro&s;es indeed
are not always &s;trewed in his path; but
from fields that are &s;eemingly wa&s;te, flowers
may be gathered by tho&s;e who look care|fully
around them. Seldom or never do
all good things for&s;ake, and all evils be&s;et
a man, at once. In &s;ome corner of our
lot there are always comforts that may be
found, if we be not &s;o fooli&s;h as to over|look
<PB N="18" REF="29">
them. Even in the intervals of &s;ick|ne&s;s
and pain, &s;atisfactions may be enjoyed.
Returns of relief are often felt with a more
lively &s;en&s;ation of plea&s;ure, than what we
ta&s;te in unbroken health. It has been often
ob&s;erved that what is very &s;evere of any
kind, &s;eldom la&s;ts long; and the unea&s;ine&s;s
which la&s;ts, we become accu&s;tomed to bear.
Time and continuance reconcile us gra|dually
to many things that were at fir&s;t
believed to be in&s;upportable. Providence
has in mercy provided this gentle opiate
to a&s;&s;uage various &s;orrows of human life.
What we behold others around us bearing,
we learn to think may al&s;o be borne by us.
<HI>The &s;pirit of man will long &s;u&s;tain his in|firmities:</HI>
From the trea&s;ures of his own
mind in reflection and meditation, much
relief will ari&s;e to the virtuous; and at the
bottom of the mo&s;t di&s;con&s;olate e&s;tate, there
lies always a &s;ecret hope that better days may
come.&mdash;From &s;uch circum&s;tances as the&s;e,
the expectation of pa&s;&s;ing through life
with &s;ome mea&s;ure of comfort, may rea|&s;onably
be entertained by &s;uch as are not
<PB N="19" REF="30">
wanting to them&s;elves in propriety of
conduct. In looking forward to futurity,
the pro&s;pect we are to take of the world
is not that which is &s;ometimes gloomily
indulged, of a for orn region where nothing
is to be beheld but dreary and inho&s;pitable
wa&s;tes, and no objects are to be met with
but &s;erpents that hi&s;s, and wild bea&s;ts that
devour. The pro&s;pect is rather that of a
mixed region, where indeed rugged rocks
are &s;een, and de&s;erts extend, over which
the tempe&s;t &s;ometimes &s;cowls; but where
al&s;o many peaceful habitations and fruitful
fields occur to refre&s;h the fight. Once
more,</P>
<P>III. We have ground to expect from
the ordinary cour&s;e of human affairs, that
if we per&s;evere in &s;tudying to do our duty
towards God and man, we &s;hall meet with
the e&s;teem, the love, and confidence of tho&s;e
who are around us. I before ob&s;erved, that
in our expectations of receiving what we
think due re&s;pect and con&s;ideration from
the world, we &s;hall be often di&s;appointed.
<PB N="20" REF="31">
But that ob&s;ervation was applied to the
claims we make on others, on account of
talents, abilities, and &s;uperiour merits. To
&s;uch claims the world is &s;eldom di&s;po&s;ed
to give a favourable reception. We live
amid&s;t rivals and competitors who&s;e &s;elf-e&s;timation
prompts them to depreciate us,
and of cour&s;e &s;ubjects us to many a morti|fication.
The ca&s;e is different with re&s;pect
to moral qualifications. There the world
is more ready to do ju&s;tice to character.
No man is hurt, at lea&s;t few are &s;o, by
hearing his neighbour e&s;teemed a worthy
and honourable man. This prai&s;e will be
be&s;towed without grudging, by many who
value them&s;elves on the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of quali|ties,
which they conceive to be of &s;uperiour
importance in the judgment of the world.</P>
<P>But whatever they may think, it is cer|tain
that the ba&s;is of all la&s;ting reputation
is laid in moral worth. Great parts and en|dowments
may &s;parkle for a while in the
public eye. The world looks up to them
with wonder, as to an extraordinary comet,
or a blazing &s;tar. Di&s;tingui&s;hed virtue and
<PB N="21" REF="32">
worth create le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hment; but, like
the fixed luminaries of heaven, they &s;hine
with more &s;teady and permanent lu&s;tre.
Unaffected piety conjoined with inviolable
uprightne&s;s and integrity in conduct, com|mand
a degree of re&s;pect which approaches
to veneration. Candour and fairne&s;s never
fail to attract e&s;teem and tru&s;t. Kindne&s;s
and benevolence conciliate love, and create
warm friend&s;hips.&mdash;The be&s;t character may
indeed for a time be accidentally ob&s;cured
and mi&s;under&s;tood. But the world com|monly
judges &s;oundly in the end. After
a man has acted his part for a while among
his fellows, he is known upon trial to be
what he is; and if his worth be real and
genuine, <HI>his righteou&s;ne&s;s comes forth as the
light, and his judgment as the noon day.</HI></P>
<P>This is what a good man has always
ground to look for, even in evil times;
and &s;urely, there are few things which he
can more de&s;ire than the pro&s;pect of being
valued and e&s;teemed by tho&s;e among whom
he lives. This counterbalances many a
di&s;advantage of outward fortune, and puts
<PB N="22" REF="33">
into his hand many opportunities of &s;atis|faction
and comfort. He is likely to po&s;|&s;e&s;s
many friends and well-wi&s;hers, and to
have few enemies. The more he is known,
the more will the favour of tho&s;e who &s;ur|round
him grow; and the pro&s;pect is before
him of having his <HI>hoary head crowned with
honour.</HI></P>
<P>THUS, in &s;everal in&s;tances, I have briefly
pointed out what may, or may not, be ex|pected
from the world, when we look for|ward
to the ordinary cour&s;e of human af|fairs:
Not an uninterrupted enjoyment of
all the comforts of pro&s;perity; not undi&s;|turbed
&s;atisfaction in our various inter|cour&s;es
with &s;ociety; not grateful returns
from all whom we have obliged or &s;erved:
But what we may expect, if we keep a
good con&s;cience and &s;tudy to do our duty,
is peace of mind; a tolerably ea&s;y and
comfortable &s;tate, amid&s;t the vici&s;&s;itudes of
life; and the love and e&s;teem of tho&s;e with
whom we are connected.&mdash;<HI>The hope of the
righteous &s;hall be gladne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="34">
THE pre&s;ent &s;ubject has led me to con|&s;ider
only what the righteous man has to
hope for in the ordinary cour&s;e of the
world. But I have now to ob&s;erve, that
he has before him a much high$$ object
of hope than any which I have yet men|tioned;
a hope which ari&s;es not from
the ordinary cour&s;e of human affairs, but
from an extraordinary interpo&s;ition of
divine grace and mercy conveyed to us
by the go&s;pel; even the <HI>hope which is
laid up for him in heaven;</HI> the a&s;&s;ured ex|pectation
of a better life, in a higher and
better world. Put the ca&s;e of the &s;ervant
of God being overwhelmed with all the
di&s;appointments which the world can bring
upon him, here is an <HI>expectation</HI> which will
be always <HI>gladne&s;s;</HI> with which he can
perpetually &s;olace him&s;elf. Through the
pre&s;ent &s;tate of exi&s;tence he is no more
than a pa&s;&s;enger. If he can render it in
any degree tolerable and ea&s;y to him&s;elf,
it is well; it is all that he expects. His
home, his place of re&s;t is in tho&s;e habita|tions
to which, through the merits of his
<PB N="24" REF="35">
Redeemer, he is taught and encouraged to
a&s;pire. He knows that <HI>in due &s;ea&s;on, he
&s;hall reap if he faint not</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Galat. vi. 9.</NOTE>. That when
the <HI>earthly hou&s;e of this tabernacle is di&s;&s;olved,
he &s;hall have a building of God, an hou&s;e

for <HI>to them who, by patient continuance in
well-doing, &s;eek for glory, honour, and im|mortality,
God will render eternal life</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. ii. 7.</NOTE>.
Hence, whether you con&s;ider him in this
life, or con&s;ider him as looking forward to
another, his hope is perpetual <HI>gladne&s;s,
while the expectations of the wicked &s;hall
peri&s;h.</HI></P>

Di&s;mi&s;&s;ing all delu&s;ions of this nature
as unworthy the attention of any rea&s;onable
unperverted mind; holding it for certain
that nothing can be more real than the

of cour&s;e from this belief, that there are
di&s;po&s;itions corre&s;pondent to Him which
ought to be found in every human mind,
among the young and the old, among the
high and the low, the rich and the poor.
It is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that while the re|lations
in which we &s;tand to our fellow-creatures,
whether as equals, &s;uperiours, or
inferiours, naturally call forth certain &s;en|timents

though we &s;ee him not, we all recogni&s;e;
to Him, <HI>in whom,</HI> as it is beautifully ex|pre&s;&s;ed
in my text, <HI>we live, and move, and
have our being.</HI></P>
<P>THE proper di&s;po&s;ition of mind with
re&s;pect to God, is generally expre&s;&s;ed by
the term of Love to him. This is very ju&s;tly
<PB N="28" REF="39">
founded on the &s;olemn injunction of our
ble&s;&s;ed Lord<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxii. 37.</NOTE>. <HI>Thou &s;halt love the Lord
thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy
&s;oul, and with all thy mind; this is the fir&s;t
and great commandment.</HI> Hence, it is com|mon
among religious writers to include
the whole of pious affections towards God
in Love. But when this term is applied
to the Almighty, we mu&s;t be careful to
under&s;tand aright what it imports. We
all know what it is to love any of our
fellow-creatures; but &s;uch an affection as
we bear to them, cannot in a literal &s;en&s;e
be transferred to God. Among them it
is &s;ometimes connected with the fervency
of pa&s;&s;ion; it commonly imports &s;ome &s;imi|larity
of nature, and &s;ome degree of fond
and intimate attachment; all which it were
highly improper in us to affect towards
the Supreme Being, <HI>who&s;e ways are not as
our ways, nor his thoughts as our thoughts.</HI>
I am afraid that the application of Love
in a &s;trict &s;en&s;e, and &s;ometimes in too &s;er|vent
<PB N="29" REF="40">
and pa&s;&s;ionate a &s;train towards God,
has, among &s;ome &s;erious and well di&s;po&s;ed
minds, given ri&s;e to no little enthu&s;ia&s;m in
religion.</P>
<P>When therefore we treat of Love as
applied to God, it mu&s;t be analy&s;ed or
re&s;olved into tho&s;e &s;entiments which are
proper and &s;uitable for us to encourage
towards the God whom we adore. That love
of him which religion requires, and which
our Saviour has &s;o &s;olemnly enjoined, is a
compounded affection, and the di&s;po&s;itions
which it includes are principally three;
reverence, gratitude, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Of the
nature and foundation of each of the&s;e I
am to treat in the &s;equel of this di&s;cour&s;e,
and &s;hall endeavour to illu&s;trate them as
forming that temper and di&s;po&s;ition of
mind which we ought always to pre&s;erve
towards the Great Author of our exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>I. THE foundation of every proper di&s;po|&s;ition
towards God mu&s;t be laid in Reve|rence,
that is, admiration mixed with awe;
what, in its lower degrees among men, is
<PB N="30" REF="41">
called Re&s;pect; but carried to its highe&s;t
point with relation to God, may be termed
profound veneration. In this di&s;po&s;ition
towards Him we ought habitually to be
found, not only in the exerci&s;es of imme|diate
devotion, but amid&s;t the ordinary oc|currences
of life. Every thing indeed that
we &s;ee around us gives perpetual occa&s;ion
for it. We find our&s;elves in an immen&s;e
univer&s;e, where it is impo&s;&s;ible for us,
without a&s;toni&s;hment and awe, to contem|plate
the glory and the power of Him who
hath created it. From the greate&s;t to the
lea&s;t object that we behold, from the &s;tar
that glitters in the heavens to the in&s;ect
that creeps upon the ground, from the
thunder that rolls in the &s;kies to the flower
that blo&s;&s;oms in the fields, all things te&s;tify
a profound and my&s;terious wi&s;dom, a
mighty and all powerful hand, before
which we mu&s;t tremble and adore. Nei|ther
the cau&s;es nor the i&s;&s;ues of the events
which we behold, is it in our power to
trace: neither how we came into this
world, nor whither we go when we retire
<PB N="31" REF="42">
from it, are we able of our&s;elves to tell;
but in the meantime find our&s;elves &s;ur|rounded
with a&s;toni&s;hing magnificence on
every hand. We walk through the earth,
as through the apartments of a va&s;t palace,
which fill every attentive &s;pectator with
wonder. All the works which our power
can erect, all the ornaments which our
art can contrive, are feeble and trifling in
compari&s;on with tho&s;e glories which nature
every where pre&s;ents to our view. The
immen&s;e arch of the heavens, the &s;plendor
of the &s;un in his meridian brightne&s;s, or
the beauty of his ri&s;ing and &s;etting hours,
the rich land&s;cape of the fields, and the
boundle&s;s expan&s;e of the ocean, are &s;cenes
which mock every rival attempt of human
&s;kill or labour. Nor is it only in the &s;plendid
appearances of nature, but amid&s;t its rude&s;t
forms, that we trace the hand of the Divi|nity.
In the &s;olitary de&s;ert, and the high
mountain, in the hanging precipice, the
roaring torrent, and the aged fore&s;t, though
there be nothing to cheer, there is much
to &s;trike the mind with awe, to give ri&s;e to
<PB N="32" REF="43">
tho&s;e &s;olemn and &s;ublime &s;en&s;ations which
elevate the heart to an Almighty, all
Creating Power.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, we can no where ca&s;t our eyes
around us without meeting what is &s;uffi|cient
to awaken reverence of the Deity.
This reverence becomes the more profound
that the great Being who is the object of
it, is to us invi&s;ible and unknown. We
may &s;eek to di&s;cover him, but he hides him|&s;elf
from us; his foot&s;teps we clearly trace,
but his face we can never behold. <HI>We go
forward, but he is not there, and backward,
but we cannot perceive him; on the left hand
where he worketh, but we cannot behold him;
he hideth him&s;elf on the right hand that we
cannot &s;ee him</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Job, xxiii. 8, 9.</NOTE>. We know that <HI>he is not
far from every one of us;</HI> yet he &s;hrouds
him&s;elf in the darkne&s;s of his pavilion; <HI>he
an&s;wereth from the &s;ecret place of thunder</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;. lxxxi. 7.</NOTE>.
Before this incomprehen&s;ible Being, this
God terrible and &s;trong, we become in a
manner annihilated; we are &s;en&s;ible that
<PB N="33" REF="44">
in his &s;ight we are only as the <HI>drop of the
bucket</HI> and the <HI>&s;mall du&s;t in the balance;</HI> and
in his pre&s;ence can only <HI>rejoice with trem|bling.</HI>
For we know that the mighty arm
which upholds the univer&s;e, and which
&s;urrounds us with wonders on every &s;ide,
can in a moment cru&s;h us to the du&s;t, if
we become objects of di&s;plea&s;ure to heaven.
Awful are the operations of the Divine
Power which we are con&s;tantly beholding
in the moral as well as in the natural world.
The Almighty rules among the nations,
as well as over individuals: on his plea&s;ure
depend all the great revolutions of the
earth; the interpo&s;itions of his Providence
are frequently apparent to the world, in
bringing down the mighty, and rai&s;ing up
the fallen. In the books of the law and
the prophets, we hear his threatenings
again&s;t rebellious &s;inners denounced with
a tremendous voice; and in the di&s;pen&s;ation
of the go&s;pel, a mo&s;t &s;triking in&s;tance is
exhibited to us of the &s;trict ju&s;tice of his
government, in the expiation that was re|quired
for the apo&s;tacy of a guilty world.
<PB N="34" REF="45">
So that both the law and the go&s;pel, the
works of nature and the conduct of Provi|dence,
unite in uttering that &s;olemn voice
which ought often to re&s;ound in our ears: <HI>Be
&s;till, and know that I am God. I will be
exalted among the heathen; I will be exalted
in the earth. Fear before him, all ye nations:
Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his
name. For honour and maje&s;ty are before
him; &s;trength and beauty are in his &s;anctuary.
He alone doth great things and unfearachable;
marvellous things without number</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;. xlvi. 10. P&s;. xcvi. 6&mdash;8. Job, v. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On this head of di&s;cour&s;e I have in&s;i&s;ted
the more, becau&s;e I apprehend that &s;uch
&s;entiments as I have now been inculcating
occur too rarely among many profe&s;&s;ed
Chri&s;tians. Did an awful reverence for the
Supreme Being dwell on all our minds
with a properly impre&s;&s;ive &s;en&s;e, its effects
would oftener appear in conduct. On
many occa&s;ions it would check a wanton
levity of &s;pirits. It would infu&s;e more &s;o|lemnity
into our religious acts. It would
<PB N="35" REF="46">
in&s;pire greater re&s;pect for the temples of
God, and for all the forms of &s;acred wor|&s;hip.
It would bani&s;h that profanation of
the name of God which we &s;o often hear
from unhallowed lips.&mdash;Let it be remem|bered
that the <HI>fear of God</HI> is, throughout
much of the &s;cripture, employed as the
term de&s;criptive of the whole of religion.
It is not the fear which &s;laves are con|&s;trained
to feel for a tyrant, but the reve|rence
which children have for the be&s;t
parent, or &s;ubjects for the be&s;t &s;overeign;
the veneration which nece&s;&s;arily enters into
the love we bear to a Being of &s;uperiour
order: it is to <HI>fear the Lord and his good|ne&s;s,</HI>
as it is emphatically expre&s;&s;ed by one
of the prophets<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Ho&s;ea, iii. 5.</NOTE>. This fear of God,
therefore, is not only con&s;i&s;tent with the
love of him, but forms a material part of
it. The pretended love of God disjoined
from reverence of him, would no longer
be genuine loye, but would ri&s;e into ar|rogant
pre&s;umption. I proceed to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="47">
II. THAT gratitude forms an e&s;&s;ential
part of that di&s;po&s;ition which we ought to
bear towards God. This implies an af|fectionate
&s;en&s;e of God upon the mind,
and enters directly into love, under&s;tood
in its mo&s;t common acceptation. It were
a gro&s;s mi&s;take to imagine that the reve|rence
of which I have di&s;cour&s;ed has any
tendency to check gratitude: on the con|trary
it heightens it, by uniting the &s;en&s;e
of our benefactor's conde&s;cen&s;ion with the
benefits which he conveys. The more
eminent the qualities of a benefactor are,
and the higher the rank is in which he
&s;tands, our hearts are warmed the more by
the feeling of his goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to think of God at all, with|out
conceiving him as the benefactor of man|kind.
My&s;terious as this world is in many,
of its appearances, it neverthele&s;s carries,
on the whole, a &s;trongly marked charac|ter
of goodne&s;s and benignity in its author.
We behold a va&s;t &s;y&s;tem obviou&s;ly con|trived
to provide, not food and nouri&s;h|ment
only, but comfort al&s;o and enjoyment
<PB N="37" REF="48">
to an infinite number of inhabitants. The
more that philo&s;ophy has enlarged our
views of nature, the more it has been di&s;|covered
that, throughout the wide extent
of creation, there is no u&s;ele&s;s profu&s;ion of
magnificence, but that every thing has been
rendered &s;ub&s;ervient to the welfare of the
rational or &s;en&s;ible world; nay, that many
objects, which were once con&s;idered as not
only &s;uperfluous but noxious, hold an u&s;e|ful
place in the general &s;y&s;tem. Such pro|vi&s;ion
has been made for our entertainment
on this earth, &s;uch care has been taken to
&s;tore the world with a variety of plea&s;ures
to cheer our &s;en&s;es and enliven our ima|gination,
that he who&s;e eye opens on all
the beauty of nature, mu&s;t be of in&s;en&s;ible
heart indeed if he feels no gratitude to that
Being who has brought him forth to enjoy
this wonderful &s;cene.</P>
<P>But the gratitude of a good man will
naturally go farther than this. He will
think not only of the benefits which he
enjoys in common with the re&s;t of his
fellow-creatures, but of tho&s;e which are
<PB N="38" REF="49">
appropriated particularly to him&s;elf.&mdash;Who
is there among&s;t us, my brethren, but in
fairly reviewing the events of his life from
infancy to this day, in thinking of the com|forts
he enjoys, and recollecting the dangers
from which he has been delivered; who
is there, I &s;ay, that has not cau&s;e to ac|knowledge
an invi&s;ible guardian, who has
all along watched over his frail e&s;tate, has
protected and ble&s;&s;ed him?&mdash;Perhaps of
the ble&s;&s;ings which you enjoy, or the de|liverances
you have received, you are more
di&s;po&s;ed to trace &s;ome human cau&s;e; one
favourable di&s;tinction you a&s;cribe to your
birth, your parents, or your education; for
&s;ome other happy circum&s;tance you think
your&s;elf &s;olely indebted to the kindne&s;s of
an earthly friend, or you refer it to the
exertions of your own dexterity and ta|lents.
&mdash;Thoughtle&s;s and incon&s;iderate man!
Have you forgotten that there is a fir&s;t
Cau&s;e of all, a Supreme Lord, who, from
the beginning, has arranged and prepared
the whole &s;eries of cau&s;es and effects, of
who&s;e de&s;tination and agency men are no
<PB N="39" REF="50">
more than the &s;econdary in&s;truments? To
what but to the original plan of his good|ne&s;s,
do you owe the favourable circum|&s;tances
of your birth or your education,
the kindne&s;s which he ordained to &s;pring
up in the brea&s;t of your friend, or the ta|lents
and abilities which he implanted
within you, in order to favour your &s;ucce&s;s?</P>
<P>But an exhortation to gratitude you per|haps
con&s;ider as coming un&s;ea&s;onably in
your pre&s;ent &s;ituation. The time was,
when the light of the divine countenance
&s;hone upon you, and looking up to a Bene|factor
in heaven, with a grateful heart you
acknowledged your ble&s;&s;ings to be derived
from Him; but that time is now pa&s;t; you
are left de&s;olate and for&s;aken, bereaved of
the chief comforts on which you had &s;et
your hearts.&mdash;And, becau&s;e many of the
favours of heaven are pa&s;t, ought they to
be gone from your remembrance? Are
there not &s;till &s;ome others remaining for
which you have rea&s;on to give thanks?
Have you forgotten all the ble&s;&s;ings you
have continued to enjoy ever &s;ince the day
<PB N="40" REF="51">
that you came forth a helple&s;s infant into
the world? Be a&s;&s;ured that a gratitude of
that &s;ort, which dies away as &s;oon as it
cea&s;es to be fed by the u&s;ual &s;tream of be|nefits,
which has regard to pre&s;ent favours
only, and none to tho&s;e that are pa&s;t, is not
true gratitude, but the &s;ymptom of a &s;elfi&s;h
and mercenary &s;pirit. If you be di&s;po&s;ed
to thank God only when he is giving you
all the de&s;ires of your hearts, what prai&s;e
have ye? Do not publicans and &s;inners
the &s;ame? men who have little either
of religion or &s;en&s;ibility of heart. But
when Providence &s;hrouds it&s;elf in a dark
cloud, and &s;ome of your favourite enjoy|ments
are carried away, if &s;till, with calm
and patient mind, you continue to ble&s;s
the name of the Lord, and &s;till retain a
thankful &s;en&s;e of the ble&s;&s;ings you have &s;o
long, and &s;o far beyond your de&s;erts, been
permitted to enjoy; this is to be truly
grateful; this is to &s;how your&s;elves the du|tiful
children of a Father in Heaven.</P>
<P>In reviewing the grounds which we
have for gratitude to God, it becomes us
<PB N="41" REF="52">
to attend, not only to tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings which
appertain individually to each of us, but to
tho&s;e al&s;o which we enjoy in common with
others of our brethren. How much rea&s;on
have we, for in&s;tance, to ble&s;s God for
having ca&s;t our lot in a land where we
enjoy all the advantages of mild and equal
government, and all the comforts of tran|quillity
and peace, while many a nation
around us is oppre&s;&s;ed by the hand of
tyrannical power, di&s;turbed with the alarms
and terrors of war, or &s;uffering from the
ravages of the ho&s;tile &s;poiler? What higher
rea&s;on &s;till to be grateful for having our
lot ca&s;t where the joyful &s;ound of the go&s;|pel
is heard, where the glad tidings <HI>of
peace upon earth and good will to the &s;ons
of men</HI> are announced to us by the Son
of God, who came to bring pardon and
&s;alvation to a guilty world? What ever|la&s;ting
ground of thankfulne&s;s is afforded
by the ble&s;&s;ed hope that is given us of life
immortal; of <HI>a hou&s;e not made with hands
eternal in the heavens, when the earthly
hou&s;e of this tabernacle &s;hall be di&s;&s;olved;
<PB N="42" REF="53">
of an inheritance, incorruptible, undefiled, and
that fadeth not away,</HI> a&s;certained to all good
men by the death and the re&s;urrection of
our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer! <HI>Ble&s;s the Lord, O
my &s;oul! and all that is within me, ble&s;s his
holy name, and forget not all his benefits;
who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who
healeth all thy di&s;ea&s;es; who redeemeth thy
life from de&s;truction; who crowneth thee
with loving kindne&s;s and tender mercies</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;. ci. 1, 2, 3.</NOTE>.
Let us now add,</P>
<P>III. ENTIRE and profound &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion
as a di&s;po&s;ition mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to be pre|&s;erved
on our part towards God. This in|cludes
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the under&s;tanding to
the di&s;coveries which God has been plea&s;ed
to make; &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the inclinations to
the laws which he has promulgated for our
conduct; &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the will to the di&s;|pen&s;ations
of his Providence, as they affect
the events of our life. It is not &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion
con&s;trained merely by a power again&s;t
<PB N="43" REF="54">
which we know that it is in vain to
&s;truggle; it is &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion ari&s;ing from re|verence
compounded with gratitude; &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion
to One who&s;e &s;upreme perfection
entitles Him to ab&s;olute obedience, who&s;e
experienced goodne&s;s affords ground for
implicit tru&s;t.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent imperfect &s;tate of human
nature, there will be often found no &s;mall
reluctance to that entire re&s;ignation to God
which religion requires. The pride of
human under&s;tanding will &s;ometimes revolt
again&s;t the di&s;coveries which God has
made in his word, as deficient and un&s;ati&s;|factory;
the &s;truggles of pa&s;&s;ion will fre|quently
ri&s;e again&s;t the re&s;traints impo&s;ed
on us by his laws, and the &s;everities in|flicted
by his Providence. But in the heart
of a pious man all &s;uch oppo&s;ition is
checked and borne down, by a &s;teady faith
that, under the admini&s;tration of the Al|mighty,
all is ordered for the be&s;t, though
for &s;everal &s;teps of that high admini&s;tration
we are unable at pre&s;ent to account.
Hence that calm tranquillity he pre&s;erves,
<PB N="44" REF="55">
and that re&s;olute and magnanimous &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion
he maintains, amid&s;t the mo&s;t unpro|mi&s;ing
circum&s;tances. He knows that in
this &s;tupendous univer&s;e there mu&s;t be
many things that lie beyond our compre|hen&s;ion.
&mdash;As yet thou fee&s;t no more than
the ri&s;e of the divine government, the be|ginnings
of a great plan which is not to be
completed until the cour&s;e of ages &s;hall
end. Meanwhile darkne&s;s mu&s;t be allowed,
for wi&s;e rea&s;ons, to remain upon many
things; &s;evere re&s;traints mu&s;t be impo&s;ed
on conduct, and occa&s;ional &s;ufferings mu&s;t
be endured. If thou &s;uffere&s;t, &s;igh, and be
&s;ilent: wait, and be patient. Pre&s;ume not
to exalt thy weak rea&s;on again&s;t the reve|lations
of heaven, nor to give vent to thy
impatient complaints again&s;t the ordinations
of thy Supreme Governour. Think with
awe, and &s;peak with caution, of what is &s;o
much above thee. Wait till thy being
&s;hall be unfolded; till it &s;hall have pa&s;&s;ed
through the nece&s;&s;ary &s;teps that &s;hall gra|dually
prepare thee for beholding the &s;e|crets
of the univer&s;e; for under&s;tanding
<PB N="45" REF="56">
the coun&s;els of the God who made it. In
the mean time, be content to &s;ubmit and
to adore. Let no other voice be heard
from thee but this; &startq;Thou ha&s;t made me,
O God! and I am thine, for <HI>in thee I live,
and move, and have my being.</HI> Where|ever
thou commande&s;t me to go, I fol|low.
Whatever thou appointe&s;t me to
&s;uffer, I bear without murmur. It is my
part to per&s;evere in my duty; all the
re&s;t I leave to Thee; to Thee, who&s;e
wi&s;dom I revere, who&s;e goodne&s;s I have
&s;o often experienced; in whom therefore
I repo&s;e implicit tru&s;t that all &s;hall end
well, and the righteous be made finally
happy.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Good is the word which the
Lord hath &s;poken. Not my will, but His be
done. Behold h$re I am. Let him do to
his &s;ervant as &s;eemeth good to him</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">2 Kings, xx. 19. Luke, xxii. 4. 2 Sam. xv. 26.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Such are the principal di&s;po&s;itions which
it becomes us to pre&s;erve towards God; to
pre&s;erve towards Him at all times; not in
the &s;olemn hours of devotion only, but
<PB N="46" REF="57">
when we act in the bu&s;y world, or when
we walk in retirement amid&s;t the &s;cenes of
nature. If this union of reverence, gra|titude,
and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, habitually po&s;&s;e&s;s our
minds, they will of cour&s;e &s;hoot forth into
what is termed <HI>delighting our&s;elves in
God;</HI> thinking of him with peculiar com|placency
and warmth of affection; and
elevating us &s;ometimes into a &s;acred tran&s;|port
when we draw nigh to him in acts of
immediate wor&s;hip, in prayer and prai&s;e.
Then is the &s;ea&s;on when the fulne&s;s of the
&s;oul gives ri&s;e to tho&s;e &s;ublime and pathetic
effu&s;ions of piety which are recorded of
&s;aints in former times: <HI>My &s;oul thir&s;teth for
God; for the living God: when &s;hall I
come and appear before him? I will lift up
my hands in thy name; my &s;oul &s;hall be &s;atis|fied
as with marrow and with fatne&s;s, when
I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate
on thee in the night watches. Ble&s;&s;ed is the
man whom thou choo&s;e&s;t, and cau&s;e&s;t to ap|proach
unto thee. O that I knew where to
find him, that I might come even to his &s;eat</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;. xlii. 2. P&s;. lxiii. 5, 6. P&s;. lxv. 4. Job, xxiii. 3.</NOTE>!</P>

When &s;uch &s;entiments as the&s;e, of ardent
affection towards God, cha&s;tened by re|verence
and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, as well as warmed
by gratitude, predominate in our hearts,

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THERE are two great a&s;pects under
which we may contemplate the appear|ance
of our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord on the earth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. III.</NOTE> One
is, his coming into the world in order to
make expiation to divine ju&s;tice, by his
&s;ufferings and death for the guilt of the
human race. The other is, his coming to
act as the enlightener and reformer of the
world, by his doctrine and his life. The
fir&s;t of tho&s;e views is the mo&s;t &s;ublime; as
<PB N="49" REF="60">
on the atonement which he made for us,
depend all our hopes of the pardon of &s;in,
and of life eternal. In the other view, it
is al&s;o of high importance that all chri&s;|tians
&s;hould frequently con&s;ider him, in
order to the proper regulation of their
conduct; the ob&s;ervation of his example
is no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary for this purpo&s;e, than
attention to his doctrine; as by his doc|trine
he taught us what we are bound to
do, &s;o in his example he &s;howed us what
we ought to be.</P>
<P>Hence the example of our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord
has been ever held up by &s;erious writers
to chri&s;tians for their in&s;truction and imi|tation.
It obviou&s;ly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es many ad|vantages
above any other &s;tandard of con|duct.
It carries peculiar obligations from
gratitude, intere&s;t, and duty, to enforce the
imitation of it; and it is the only example,
in following which, we are certain never
to err. It has al&s;o another peculiar ad|vantage
attending it, which is not &s;o com|monly
thought of; that is, the univer&s;ality
of its u&s;e. It evidently appears that our
<PB N="50" REF="61">
Lord him&s;elf had this benefit to his fol|lowers
in view from the train of living
which he cho&s;e to adopt. Had he pitched
upon any one &s;tation of life, the influence
of his example would have been much
more limited. The integrity, for in&s;tance,
of Samuel as a judge, the devotion of
David on the throne, the fortitude of Daniel
in the mid&s;t of a corrupt court, hold forth
indeed &s;plendid in&s;tances of virtue, but
they hold them out only to a few:
whereas when Chri&s;t appeared on earth,
he confined him&s;elf to no one &s;tate of for|tune
or line of life; he did not addict him&s;elf
to any particular calling; he did not even
fix his re&s;idence in one place, but he gives
us opportunity of viewing him in different
places and &s;ituations, in all that variety of
lights which indi&s;criminately regard the
bulk of mankind: his life was divided be|tween
the contemplative and the active;
devotion and bu&s;ine&s;s equally &s;hared it.
We behold him in private life among his
di&s;ciples, like a father in the mid&s;t of his
family. We behold him in public life,
<PB N="51" REF="62">
acting with authority in the di&s;charge of
his high commi&s;&s;ion, a&s;&s;uming the dignity
which belonged to his office, and boldly
reproving the great and the powerful.
We &s;ee him &s;ometimes in poverty and ob|&s;curity,
contemned and per&s;ecuted. We
&s;ee him at other times elevated into public
favour, followed by applauding crowds,
and entering Jeru&s;alem in triumph. We
can challenge all hi&s;tory &s;acred or profane,
to &s;how us any eminent per&s;onage, &s;aint,
philo&s;opher, or hero, who&s;e character was
&s;o thoroughly tried, and &s;o fully exhibited
to admiration, as that of our Saviour. What
adds greatly to the lu&s;tre of his example,
it was marked by no affected &s;ingularities
nor peculiar au&s;terities. He did not &s;eclude
him&s;elf from ordinary &s;ociety, but con|ver&s;ed
among men with that &s;ort of mode&s;t
piety and virtue which &s;uits it&s;elf to the
level of human infirmity, and is con&s;pi|cuous
for the di&s;charge of the plain and
&s;ub&s;tantial duties of a good life.</P>
<P>It is not my intention at pre&s;ent to at|tempt
a full &s;urvey of all the graces and
<PB N="52" REF="63">
virtues which di&s;tingui&s;hed our Lord's life,
and ennobled his &s;ufferings and death; as
this would lead into a field too exten&s;ive
for one di&s;cour&s;e: I mean to confine my|&s;elf
to the manner in which he fulfilled the
&s;ocial duties, and exerci&s;ed his benevolence
as a man among men. This will afford an
in&s;tructive view of what may be termed
the moral character of Chri&s;t in his ordi|nary
intercour&s;e with the world, and will
point out a proper model of our behaviour
towards one another. The mo&s;t &s;tudied
and laboured encomiums never drew a
more amiable character than what is con|tained
in the few and plain words of the
text; <HI>Je&s;us of Nazareth went about, doing
good.</HI> Let us con&s;ider in what manner He
fulfilled this character.</P>
<P>I. WE are to attend to his a&s;&s;iduity and
alacrity in &s;eeking out and embracing every
opportunity of doing good: this is the
mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial part of the great virtue of
charity. There is a &s;ort of negative good|ne&s;s
with which mo&s;t men are ready to be
<PB N="53" REF="64">
&s;atisfied; they appland them&s;elves if they
have kept their hands free from unju&s;t
deeds, and no man can reproach them for
working mi&s;chief to their neighbour; but
with re&s;pect to his welfare they are totally
indifferent. They remain in a &s;ort of
torpid apathy about the concerns of others,
without either rejoicing in their pro&s;perity,
or being affected with their di&s;tre&s;&s;es: this
is far below what is required of a good
man. We were all de&s;igned by our Creator
to be parts of one body, members of one
great &s;ociety, where every one was to con|tribute
his part towards the common be|nefit,
and to be made happy by &s;tudying
to make others &s;o. In proportion indeed
as our ability and influence extend, the
obligation to be exten&s;ively beneficial al&s;o
grows; but hardly is there any &s;phere &s;o
narrow and circum&s;cribed, as not to afford
&s;ome opportunities of being u&s;eful.&mdash;In
thy humble and ob&s;cure &s;tation, thou
art apt to think thy&s;elf entirely in&s;ig|nificant
and lo&s;t to the world. To thee,
indeed, it may not belong to heal the di&s;|ea&s;ed,
<PB N="54" REF="65">
to rai&s;e the fallen, to &s;upply the in|digent,
or to bring forward the de&s;erving.
But is there none who&s;e &s;pirit thou can&s;t
cheer, or who&s;e infirmities thou can&s;t help
to lighten? Ha&s;t thou no parent, no child,
no brother, no friend, to whom thou can&s;t
&s;peak the words of comfort in the hour of
&s;orrow, who&s;e mi&s;takes thou can&s;t rectify,
or who&s;e erring &s;teps thou can&s;t turn into
the right path?</P>
<P>Here let the example of Chri&s;t, as far
as thy &s;phere admits it, be before, thine
eyes to quicken thine activity and ani|mate
thy zeal. The whole hi&s;tory of his
life is the hi&s;tory of active and diffu|&s;ive
benignity. Wherever he was pre|&s;ent,
we find him employed in doing
good; either relieving men from their di&s;|tre&s;&s;es,
or making them wi&s;e and happy
by his in&s;tructions. The whole country
around him &s;eemed to be his family, and if
in a literal &s;en&s;e he had been the father of
them all, they could not have exerci&s;ed his
care, or &s;hared his bounty more. The hun|gry
were fed, and the &s;ick were cured, the
<PB N="55" REF="66">
blind &s;aw, and the lame walked, wherever he
came. His miracles never were mere often|tations
of power, but always expre&s;&s;ions of
goodne&s;s. Often he prevented the &s;uppli|cations
of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and, una&s;ked, con|ferred
his favours; but never did any per&s;on
apply to him for aid and relief without
receiving it, whether he was Jew or Hea|then,
friend or foe. What is e&s;pecially re|markable
in his bene&s;icence is, that it was
continued and per&s;evering in the mid&s;t of
ingratitude. This is one of the harde&s;t trials
of virtue, not to be &s;oured by the perver&s;ity
of men, and which per&s;ons even of generous
&s;pirits find it the mo&s;t difficult to bear. But
though Chri&s;t had to deal with a mo&s;t un|toward
and &s;tubborn generation, whom no
evidence could convince, and no goodne&s;s
could mollify; though of all the great num|bers,
who had been objects of his benefi|cence,
we read of few who thankfully ac|knowledged
his kindne&s;s, fewer who be|came
his followers, and none who ro&s;e up
to a&s;&s;ert his cau&s;e when borne down by
unju&s;t per&s;ecution; yet, &s;eeking to do good
<PB N="56" REF="67">
only for its own &s;ake, he per&s;evered to the
la&s;t in unwearied beneficence. He <HI>overcame
evil with good:</HI> it had been his principle,
and, it would appear, a noted &s;aying of his,
which his di&s;ciples remembered and quoted
after his death; <HI>it is more ble&s;&s;ed to give,
than to receive</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Acts, xx. 35.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>II. WE ought to propo&s;e for imitation
that humanity of manners, that gentlene&s;s
and affability which appeared in the whole
of our Lord's behaviour. This relates to
the manner of conferring benefits, which
is often as material as the benefits them|&s;elves
are. The&s;e are &s;ometimes conferred
&s;o ungraciou&s;ly, as to carry the air of in&s;ults
rather than benefits; whereas, when they
bear the marks of proceeding from real
kindne&s;s, their value is heightened, and
they are received with double plea&s;ure.
There are numberle&s;s occa&s;ions, when the
di&s;covery of a humane temper, and the le&s;&s;er
offices of obliging and courteous behaviour,
<PB N="57" REF="68">
contribute e&s;&s;entially to the happine&s;s of
others, and &s;upply the place of greater be|nefits,
which may not be in our power to
be&s;tow.&mdash;For this amiable &s;pirit our Lord
was remarkably di&s;tingui&s;hed. He was open
and affable to all, and ea&s;ier of $word$ than
his own di&s;ciples. On different $ ca&s;ion$
we find him checking his di&s;ciples, when
they re&s;trained the forwardne&s;s of the mul|titude
who pre&s;&s;ed upon him, &s;eeking relief.
Nay, he rebuked them for forbidding little
children to come to him, whom the fond|ne&s;s
of the parents &s;ought to introduce to
his pre&s;ence. He took the children into his
arms and ble&s;&s;ed them, and propounded
them to his di&s;ciples as emblems of that
innocence and &s;implicity which are requi&s;ite
for our entering into the kingdom of
heaven<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mark, x. 14.</NOTE>.&mdash;He conver&s;ed familiarly with
all &s;orts of people, and readily an&s;wered
the que&s;tions they put to him. He had
nothing of that haughty and di&s;tant re&s;erve
which we &s;o often &s;ee maintained by men
<PB N="58" REF="69">
of the world, and which prevents them
from holding intercour&s;e with any whom
they con&s;ider as their inferiours in repu|tation
or in rank. On the contrary, as our
Lord was ready to do good to all, &s;o he
di&s;dained not to receive kindne&s;s from
others; complying chearfully with the de|&s;ire
of tho&s;e who invited him to their
hou&s;es, and accepting in good part the
pro&s;&s;ered tokens of their well-intended re|&s;pect.
For &s;uch in&s;tances of courte&s;y he
was reproached by the Jews as one who
wanted that external &s;everity of manners
which they imagined to belong to a pro|&s;e&s;&s;ed
reformer of the world. But He,
who knew what was in the heart of man,
&s;aw that gentlene&s;s and conde&s;cen&s;ion were
more effectual methods of gaining men
over to goodne&s;s, than har&s;hne&s;s and au&s;te|rity;
and therefore did not decline all con|ver&s;ation
with men of doubtful or ble|mi&s;hed
lives, as long as there was any hope
of making them better. It was indeed
true that he was, as they reproached him,
<HI>a friend to publicans and &s;inners;</HI> for he was
<PB N="59" REF="70">
a friend to every one to whom he could
do good.&mdash;At the &s;ame time, it is of im|portance
to remark, that this benignity of
our Lord's manners never betrayed him
into the oppo&s;ite extreme, never degene|rated
into that ea&s;ine&s;s of good nature,
which too often leads men to &s;lide into the
manners and habits of tho&s;e with whom
they conver&s;e, though they cannot ap|prove
of them. Wherever the intere&s;ts of
virtue were concerned, our Saviour was
inflexibly firm. He boldly lifted up his
voice, and te&s;tified again&s;t vice and cor|ruption
wherever he beheld them. He
freely reproved the greate&s;t men of the
nation for their hypocritical and a&s;&s;umed
&s;hews of &s;ancity; and the civility, with
which he was entertained in the hou&s;e of
a Phari&s;ee, did not prevent him from in|veighing
&s;everely again&s;t the vices of that
&s;ect in their own pre&s;ence<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Luke; xi. 37.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>III. WE are to con&s;ider our Lord in the
light of a faithful and affectionate friend,
<PB N="60" REF="71">
and his example as the pattern of all the
offices that belong to virtuous friend&s;hip.
The Apo&s;tles whom he cho&s;e for his inti|mate
companions and friends, were men
of hone&s;t and candid minds, and of great
plainne&s;s and &s;implicity of character; men
who, from real e&s;teem, and from conviction
of the truth of his mi&s;&s;ion, had become his
followers, and who, notwith&s;tanding the
di&s;advantages of his fortune in the world,
continued to follow him to the la&s;t. At the
&s;ame time, together with tho&s;e e&s;&s;ential
principles of worth, they had al&s;o great
defects. They were mo&s;t of them of timid
and fearful di&s;po&s;ition, of &s;low under&s;tand|ing,
backward to apprehend &s;piritual things,
and &s;till prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the favourite
prejudice of their nation, that the promi&s;ed
Me&s;&s;iah was to be a great conqueror, who
was to re&s;cue their country from foreign
&s;ubjection, and rai&s;e it to empire and gran|deur.
&mdash;Among the&s;e men our Lord pa&s;&s;ed
all the hours of his private life, acting
every part of an affectionate and faithful
friend, commending, advi&s;ing, and reprov|ing
<PB N="61" REF="72">
with great &s;incerity, and at the &s;ame
time with great tenderne&s;s. In his manner
of living he put him&s;elf perfectly on a level
with them. Some of them he honoured
with greater intimacy than others; but like
a prudent father in his family, he allowed
none of them to affect &s;uperiority over the
re&s;t, and checked all that tended to rivalry
among them. He never flattered them in
their failings. He never &s;oothed them with
vain hopes. He never concealed the di&s;a|greeable
con&s;equences that would &s;ollow
from adherence to his cau&s;e. Again and
again he inculcated what they were back|ward
and unwilling to believe concerning
him&s;elf; and though the que&s;tions they put
often di&s;covered a degree of gro&s;s ignorance,
he an&s;wered them all without pa&s;&s;ion or
impatience, training them up by degrees
to the events that were to happen after his
decea&s;e, and to the high part they were de&s;|tined
then to act in the world.</P>
<P>How happy would it be for mankind if
more attention were given to this noble pat|tern
of fidelity and complacency which
<PB N="62" REF="73">
ought to prevail among friends, and of the in|dulgence
due to the failings of tho&s;e who are,
in their general character, worthy and e&s;ti|mable
per&s;ons! This amiable indulgence he
carried &s;o far, that in one of the mo&s;t critical
&s;ea&s;ons of his life, during his agony in the
garden, when he had left his di&s;ciples for
a &s;hort time, with a &s;trict charge to watch
till he &s;hould return, but upon his return|ing
found them a&s;leep, all the reproof which
their negligence at &s;o important a juncture
drew from him, was no more than this,
<HI>What, could ye not watch with me for one
hour</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxvi. 40.</NOTE>?&mdash;Of the tenderne&s;s of our Lord's
affections, and the con&s;tancy of his friend|&s;hip,
we have a very memorable in&s;tance,
in that mixture of friend&s;hip and &s;ilial
piety which he di&s;covered during the
cruelty of his la&s;t &s;ufferings. It is recorded
that when he hung upon the cro&s;s, behold|ing
John his beloved di&s;ciple, and Mary
his mother, &s;tanding as &s;pectators below,
he &s;aid to John, <HI>Behold thy mother;</HI> and
to Mary, <HI>Behold thy &s;on;</HI> thus, committing
<PB N="63" REF="74">
his forlorn mother to the charge of his
friend John, as the mo&s;t &s;acred and honour|able
pledge he could leave him of their
antient friend&s;hip. The heart of his friend
melted; and from that hour, we are told,
<HI>he took her home with him to his own hou&s;e.</HI>
It is John him&s;elf who has recorded to us
this honourable te&s;timony of his ma&s;ter's
friend&s;hip<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">John, xix, 26, 27.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IV. THE example of Chri&s;t holds forth
for our imitation his &s;teady command of
temper amid&s;t the highe&s;t provocations,
and his ready forgivene&s;s of injuries.
Though he had revenge always in his
power, he con&s;tantly declined it. On one
occa&s;ion when his di&s;ciples wi&s;hed him to
call down fire from heaven to puni&s;h the
inho&s;pitality of the Samaritans, <HI>he turned
and rebuked them, &s;aying, ye know not what
manner of &s;pirit ye are of; for the Son of
Man is not come to de&s;troy men's lives, but
to &s;ave them</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke, ix. 55.</NOTE>. When he was <HI>reviled, he
<PB N="64" REF="75">
reviled not again; when he &s;uffered, he
threatened not.</HI> The in&s;ults, which he often
received from a brutal multitude, had no
power to alter the meekne&s;s and genero&s;ity
of his di&s;po&s;ition: he continued to be&s;eech
and intreat them, when they &s;ought to
cha&s;e him away from among&s;t them. When
they accu&s;ed him of being in confederacy
with evil &s;pirits, he an&s;wered their injurious
defamation only with mild and calm rea|&s;oning,
that if he by means <HI>of Satan did
ca&s;t out Satan, his kingdom mu&s;t be divided
again&s;t it&s;elf, and could not &s;tand.</HI> At his
trial before the High Prie&s;t, when he was
mo&s;t injuriou&s;ly treated, and contrary to all
law was, in face of the court, &s;truck by one
of the High Prie&s;t's officers, what could
be &s;poken more meekly and rea&s;onably
than his return to this u&s;age, at a time
when all circum&s;tances concurred to exa&s;|perate
the &s;pirit of an innocent man; <HI>if I
have &s;poken evil, bear witne&s;s of the evil;
but if well, why &s;mite&s;t thou me</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">John, xviii. 27.</NOTE>?&mdash;When
<PB N="65" REF="76">
his enemies were completing the la&s;t &s;cene
of their cruelty in putting him to death,
all their barbarous u&s;age and &s;currilous
taunts on that occa&s;ion, provoked not one
revengeful thought in his brea&s;t, nor drew
from his lips one mi&s;becoming expre&s;&s;ion;
but, on the contrary, the la&s;t accents of his
expiring breath went forth in that affec|tionate
prayer for their forgivene&s;s; <HI>Father,
forgive them, for they know not what they
do!</HI>&mdash;Shall we, my friends, who have before
our eyes &s;uch an example of generous
magnanimity, of continued &s;elf-command
amid&s;t the mo&s;t trying &s;ituations, not be
a&s;hamed of giving vent to pa&s;&s;ion on every
trifling provocation, and &s;iercely demand|ing
reparation for the &s;malle&s;t injury; we,
who, from the remembrance of our own
failings, have &s;o many motives for mutual
forbearance and forgivene&s;s; while He,
on the other hand, had done no wrong,
had never given offence to any, but had
the ju&s;te&s;t title to expect friend&s;hip from
every human being?</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="77">
V. LET us attend to the &s;ympathy and
compa&s;&s;ion which our Lord di&s;covered for
the &s;ufferings of mankind. It was not with
a cold unfeeling di&s;po&s;ition that he per|formed
the office of relieving the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.
His manner of be&s;towing relief clearly
&s;howed with what &s;en&s;ibility he entered
into the &s;orrows of others. How affecting,
for in&s;tance, is the account of his re&s;toring
to life the &s;on of the widow of Nain, as it
is related in the beautiful &s;implicity of the
evangelical hi&s;torian? <HI>When be came nigh
to the gate of the city, behold there was a
dead man carried out, the only &s;on of his
mother; and &s;he was a widow; and much
people of the city was with her.</HI> All the
circum&s;tances in this incident are moving
and affecting; and it pre&s;ently appeared
with what tender &s;en&s;ibility our Lord was
touched at the fight of &s;o mournful a pro|ce&s;&s;ion.
<HI>And when the Lord &s;aw her, he
had compa&s;&s;ion on her, and &s;aid unto her,
Weep not; and he came and touched the
bier, (and they that bare him &s;tood &s;till,)
and he &s;aid, Young man, I &s;ay unto thee,
<PB N="67" REF="78">
ari&s;e. And he that was dead, &s;at up and
began to &s;peak; and he delivered him to his
mother</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Luke, vii. 12&mdash;16.</NOTE>. The whole &s;cene of rai&s;ing La|zarus
from the grave, places our Saviour's
&s;ympathy in the &s;tronge&s;t light. As &s;oon
as he came among the mourning friends,
although he knew the cau&s;e of their
mourning was &s;peedily to be removed,
he could not forbear partaking of their
&s;orrow; <HI>He groaned, and was troubled in
&s;pirit;</HI> and when &s;urrounded by a crowd
in tears, he approached to the grave of his
decea&s;ed friend, it is expre&s;sly recorded, to
the eternal honour of his feelings, <HI>Je&s;us
wept; and the Jews &s;aid, Behold how he
loved him</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John, xi. 35.</NOTE>!&mdash;In like manner, when, for
the la&s;t time, he was about to enter into
Jeru&s;alem, though the certain knowledge
of all the cruelties which were prepared
for him there, would have filled the brea&s;t
of any ordinary per&s;on with indignation
and hatred, in&s;tead of &s;uch emotions, the
<PB N="68" REF="79">
fore&s;ight of the direful calamities which
hung over that devoted city melted his
heart; and when he drew near to it and
beheld it, <HI>he wept;</HI> pouring forth that pa|thetic
lamentation; <HI>O Jeru&s;alem, Jeru&s;alem,
thou that kille&s;t the Prophets and &s;tone&s;t
them that are &s;ent unto thee, how often would
I have gathered thy children together, as a
hen doth gather her brood under her wings,
and ye would not! If thou had&s;t known,
at lea&s;t in this thy day, the things which
belong unto thy peace, but now they are
bid from thine eyes</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Luke, xiii. 31. Luke, xix. 42.</NOTE>!. Thus, as a man, he
indulged all the amiable feelings of
our nature, teaching us that it is our duty
to regulate our pa&s;&s;ions, not to extirpate
them.</P>
<P>SUCH was Je&s;us of Nazareth, the founder
of our religion. A part only of his cha|racter
I have now attempted to delineate:
many other of his eminent graces and vir|tues
<PB N="69" REF="80">
have been left in the &s;hade. But in
what we have now contemplated of his
behaviour as a man among men, we behold
a perfect model of the conduct we ought
to hold in the ordinary intercour&s;e of &s;o|ciety
with one another. We have &s;een
him attentive to every opportunity of being
beneficent and u&s;eful; in his behaviour to
all men, a&s;&s;able and obliging; to his friends,
faithful and indulgent; to his enemies,
generous and forgiving; to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed,
full of tenderne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion. I might
al&s;o have dwelt upon the peaceable &s;pirit he
di&s;played on all occa&s;ions; his re&s;pect, as
a &s;ubject, to the civil laws and government
of his country; di&s;couraging a factious and
mutinous &s;pirit; paying tribute when de|manded;
exhorting his followers to render
unto Ce&s;ar the things which are Ce&s;ar's,
as unto God tho&s;e which are God's.
Enough has been &s;aid to &s;how what a
ble&s;&s;ing it would prove to the world, if
this illu&s;trious example were generally fol|lowed.
Men would then become happy
<PB N="70" REF="81">
in all their connexions with one another.
This world would be a ble&s;&s;ed dwelling;
and the &s;ociety of human beings on earth,
would approach to the joy and peace of the
&s;ocieties of the ju&s;t in heaven.</P>

are vi&s;ible and &s;triking objects, on which
our &s;en&s;es and imagination are accu&s;tomed
to dwell. But to procure an equal atten|tion
to what is inward and &s;piritual, is much
more difficult. It is not ea&s;y to convince
men that the &s;oul hath intere&s;ts of its own,
quite di&s;tinct from tho&s;e of the body, and
is liable to di&s;ea&s;es and wounds as real as
any which the body &s;uffers, and often much
more grievous. What pa&s;&s;es within the
hearts of men, is always invi&s;ible to the
public eye. If it be of the plea&s;ing and
&s;atisfactory kind, they have no occa&s;ion to
di&s;clo&s;e it; and if it be of a painful nature,
it is often their intent to conceal it. In the
mean time, <HI>the heart knoweth its own bit|terne&s;s:</HI>
and from its being &s;ecreted from
public ob&s;ervation and concentrated within
the brea&s;t, it is felt the more deeply.&mdash;<HI>The
&s;pirit of a man will &s;u&s;tain his infirmity;</HI>
the natural vigour and courage of his mind
may enable him to &s;urmount the ordinary
di&s;tre&s;&s;es of life; to bear with patience
poverty, &s;ickne&s;s, or pain, as long as he is
con&s;cious that all is right and found within.
<PB N="73" REF="84">
But if within him, the di&s;ea&s;e rankles in
his mind and his heart; if that which
&s;hould &s;u&s;tain him &s;erves only to gall and
torment him; to what quarter can he then
look for relief, or to what medicine apply,
when that which &s;hould have cured his other
wounds is it&s;elf di&s;ea&s;ed and wounded?
<HI>A wounded &s;pirit who can bear?</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;pirit or &s;oul of man is wounded
chiefly by three cau&s;es; by Folly, by
Pa&s;&s;ion, by Guilt.</P>
<P>I. IT is wounded by Folly; that is, by
$ain, light, and improper pur&s;uits; by a
conduct, which though it &s;hould not be
immediately criminal, yet is un&s;uitable to
one's age, character, or condition in the
world. Good &s;en&s;e is no le&s;s requi&s;ite in
our religious and moral behaviour, than it
is in our worldly affairs. Whoever de|parts
far from the plain track of &s;ober and
rea&s;onable conduct, &s;hall, &s;ooner or later,
undergo the con&s;equences of a di&s;ea&s;ed and
wounded &s;pirit.&mdash;It often happens, that
under the notion of innocent plea&s;ure and
amu&s;ement, of only following their hu|mour
<PB N="74" REF="85">
and indulging their ta&s;te, while, as
they &s;ay, they hurt no man, and violate no
material duty, many go on, for a time, in
a cour&s;e of the mo&s;t egregious follies, and
all along conceive them&s;elves to be, if not
very virtuous, at lea&s;t very inoffen&s;ive men.
The ca&s;e is the &s;ame with the di&s;ea&s;es of
the mind, as with the di&s;ea&s;es of the
body. They lurk for a time unperceived.
The &s;eeds of them may be working
within, while the per&s;on affected imagines
him&s;elf to be in perfect health: but at
length a cri&s;is comes, which brings the
&s;ecret venom forth, and makes all its ma|lignity
be felt.</P>
<P>In this age of di&s;&s;ipation and luxury in
which we live, how many avenues are con|&s;tantly
open that lead to the Temple of
Folly? To how many temptations are all,
but e&s;pecially the young and the gay, ex|po&s;ed,
to &s;quander their whole time amid&s;t
the circles of levity, and haunts of plea&s;ure?
By idlene&s;s and extravagance, and the vain
ambition of emulating others in the &s;plendid
&s;how of life, multitudes run into expence
beyond their fortune. The time which
<PB N="75" REF="86">
&s;hould be employed in training them for
future &s;ignificance in the world, they lo&s;e
in frivolous amu&s;ements and pur&s;uits; or,
in the mid&s;t of the&s;e, bury the fruits of any
good education they had already received.
Idle a&s;&s;ociates are ever at hand to aid them
in inventing new plans of de&s;troying the
time. If that fatal engine of mi&s;chief, the
gaming table, then attracts and en&s;nares
them, their career of folly will &s;oon be com|pleted;
the gulph of de&s;truction opens,
and ruin is at hand.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing &s;ome incident to befal, as
befal at &s;ome time it mu&s;t, which &s;hall
awaken per&s;ons of this de&s;cription from their
dreams of vanity; which &s;hall open their
eyes to the time that they have mi&s;pent,
and the follies which they have committed;
then, alas! what mortifying and di&s;quieting
views of them&s;elves will ari&s;e? How many
galling remembrances will crowd upon
their minds? They &s;ee their youth thrown
away in di&s;honourable or trivial pur&s;uits;
tho&s;e valuable opportunities which they
once enjoyed, of coming forward with di&s;|tinction
<PB N="76" REF="87">
in the world, now irretrievably lo&s;t;
their characters tarni&s;hed and &s;unk in the
public eye; and the fortune, perhaps,
which they had inherited from their an|ce&s;tors,
wa&s;ted among idle companions.
They behold around them the countenances
of their friends, angry and di&s;plea&s;ed. To
the grave and the re&s;pectable, they dare
not look up. They, with whom they once
&s;tarted in the race of life as their equals,
have now got far before them; they are
obliged to re&s;pect them as their &s;uperiours,
and with &s;hame to view them&s;elves left be|hind,
di&s;graced and di&s;honoured.&mdash;Can any
&s;ituation be more humbling and mortifying
than this? Is not this to &s;uffer in a high
degree the mi&s;ery of a wounded &s;pirit,
when a man &s;ees that by mere thoughtle&s;s|ne&s;s
and folly, he has expo&s;ed and degraded
him&s;elf; beholds his character, his health,
his intere&s;t, &s;inking in the world; and is
&s;en&s;ible that with his own hands, and by
his own blind and ill-judged conduct, he
has brought this ruin on him&s;elf?&mdash;Con|&s;cience
now begins to exert its authority,
<PB N="77" REF="88">
and lift its &s;courge. At every &s;troke it in|flicts,
the wounds of the heart open and
bleed: and though it exerci&s;e not the &s;ame
dread &s;everity as when it upbraids us with
notorious crimes, yet &s;till it is the voice
of God within, rebuking and puni&s;hing
rea&s;onable creatures for folly as well as
for guilt; nor indeed are follies of &s;uch a
kind as have been de&s;cribed, ever free from
many &s;tains of guilt.</P>
<P>II. IF by Folly the &s;pirit is thus liable to
be wounded, it is expo&s;ed by Pa&s;&s;ion to
wounds &s;till more &s;evere. Pa&s;&s;ions are tho&s;e
&s;trong emotions of the mind which impel
it to de&s;ire, and to act, with vehemence.
When directed towards proper objects, and
kept within ju&s;t bounds, they po&s;&s;e&s;s an
u&s;eful place in our frame; they add vigour
and energy to the mind, and enable it, on
great occa&s;ions, to act with uncommon
force and &s;ucce&s;s; but they always require
the government and re&s;traint of rea&s;on.
It is in the mind, ju&s;t as it is in the body.
<PB N="78" REF="89">
Every member of the body is u&s;eful, and
&s;erves &s;ome good purpo&s;e. But if any one
&s;well to an enormous &s;ize, it pre&s;ently be|comes
a di&s;ea&s;e. Thus, when a man's pa&s;|&s;ions
go on in a calm and moderate train,
and no object has taken an inordinate
hold of any of them, his &s;pirit is in this part
&s;ound, and his life proceeds with tranquil|lity.
But if any of them have been &s;o far
indulged, and left without re&s;traint, as to
run into exce&s;s, a dangerous blow will then
be given to the heart.&mdash;Suppo&s;ing, for in|&s;tance,
that &s;ome pa&s;&s;ion, even of the nature
of tho&s;e which are reckoned innocent, &s;hall
&s;o far &s;eize a man as to conquer and over|power
him, his tranquillity will be de|&s;troyed.
The balance of his &s;oul is lo&s;t;
he is no longer his own ma&s;ter, nor is
capable of attending properly to the offices
of life which are incumbent on him, or of
turning his thoughts into any other direc|tion
than what pa&s;&s;ion points out. He may
be &s;en&s;ible of the wound. He feels the dart
that is fixed in his brea&s;t, but is unable to
extract it.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="90">
But the ca&s;e becomes infinitely wor&s;e,
if the pa&s;&s;ion which has &s;eized a man be
of the vicious and malignant kind. Let him
be placed in the mo&s;t pro&s;perous &s;ituation of
life; give him external ea&s;e and affluence to
the full; and let his character be high, and
applauded by the world: yet, if into the
heart of this man there has &s;tolen &s;ome
dark jealous &s;u&s;picion, &s;ome rankling envy,
&s;ome pining di&s;content, that in&s;tant his
temper is &s;oured, and poi&s;on is &s;cattered
over all his joys. He dwells in &s;ecret upon
his vexations and cares, and while the
crowd admires his pro&s;perity, he envies
the more peaceful condition of the pea&s;ant
and the hind. If his pa&s;&s;ions chance to be
of the more fierce and outrageous nature,
the painful feelings they produce will be
&s;till more inten&s;e and acute. By violent
pa&s;&s;ions the heart is not only wounded, but
torn and rent. As long as a man is under
the workings of raging ambition, di&s;ap|pointed
pride, and keen thir&s;t for revenge,
he remains under immediate torment. Over
his dark and &s;cowling mind, gloomy ideas
<PB N="80" REF="91">
continually brood. His tran&s;ient &s;its of
merriment and joy, are like beams of light
breaking, occa&s;ionally, from the black cloud
that carries the thunder.&mdash;What greatly
aggravates the mi&s;ery of &s;uch per&s;ons is,
that they dare make no complaints. When
the body is $word$ or $word$ to our
friends we naturally fly; and from their
&s;ympathy or a&s;&s;i&s;tance expect relief. But
the wounds given to the heart by ill-go|verned
pa&s;&s;ions, are of an opprobrious na|ture,
and mu&s;t be &s;tifled in &s;ecret. The &s;lave
of pa&s;&s;ion can unbo&s;om him&s;elf to no friend;
and, in&s;tead of &s;ympathy, dreads meeting
with ridicule or contempt,&mdash;How intoler|ably
wretched mu&s;t the condition of Haman
have been, when, before all his a&s;&s;embled
friends, he was reduced to make this
humbling confe&s;&s;ion of his &s;tate; that, in
the height of royal favour, and in the
mid&s;t of the utmo&s;t magnificence and grandeur,
&startq;all availed him nothing, &s;o long as
he &s;aw his rival, Mordecai the Jew, &s;it|ting
at the King's gate!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="92">
III. THE wounds which the heart re|ceives
from guilt, are productive of &s;till
greater pain and mi&s;ery, than any which
have been already mentioned. If beyond
being mi&s;led by folly, or overcome by pa&s;|&s;ion,
a man be con&s;cious to him&s;elf of hav|ing
deliberately committed deeds of in|ju&s;tice
or cruelty; of having, perhaps, by
wicked arts, &s;educed the innocent and un|wary,
to fall the mi&s;erable victims of his li|centious
plea&s;ures; of having ruined, by his
di&s;hone&s;ty, the un&s;u&s;picious tru&s;ting friend;
of having ama&s;&s;ed wealth to him&s;elf, by
fraud and oppre&s;&s;ion, from the &s;poils of
the indu&s;trious: in &s;uch and &s;imilar ca&s;es,
deep and la&s;ting is the &s;ting which is &s;ent
into the heart.</P>
<P>I am aware of the arts which have been
devi&s;ed by criminal men to &s;helter them|&s;elves
from the attacks of con&s;cience; of
the &s;ceptical principles to which they have
recour&s;e; and of the &s;elf-deceiving opinions
with which they flatter them&s;elves concern|ing
their own character, concerning the
goodne&s;s of God, and the allowances which
<PB N="82" REF="93">
they hope will be made for human in|firmity
and &s;trong temptations. But all
tho&s;e palliatives of guilt are no other to
the &s;oul, than the empirick medicines that
are applied to the di&s;ea&s;es of the body;
which di&s;gui&s;e the di&s;ea&s;e, without removing
it; which procure a little temporary ea&s;e,
and conceal from the patient the danger
of his &s;tate; but drive the di&s;temper to the
vitals, and make it break forth in the end
with redoubled force. Thus may tho&s;e
dangerous opiates of con&s;cience &s;oothe a
man for a while, in the days of his pro&s;|perity.
Amid&s;t the bu&s;tle of active life,
and as long as the flu&s;ter of gay and youth|ful
&s;pirits la&s;ts, he may go on in the com|mi&s;&s;ion
of many crimes with &s;moothne&s;s
and &s;eeming peace. But let the &s;ober and
&s;erious hour come, which, &s;ooner or later,
mu&s;t come to all; let the amu&s;ements of
life be withdrawn, and the man be left
alone to his own reflections; the power of
truth will &s;oon prove too &s;trong for all that
is oppo&s;ed to it, and pierce into his heart.
&mdash;The voice of nature, of con&s;cience,
<PB N="83" REF="94">
and of God, will make it&s;elf be heard
within him. He will feel that he is a
wretch. He will become de&s;picable in his
own &s;ight. He will become &s;en&s;ible that
all good men have rea&s;on to hate him, and
that the ju&s;t governor of the world has
rea&s;on to puni&s;h him. Con&s;cience, bring|ing
to remembrance all his &s;ecret crimes,
will held them up to his view with this
fearful in&s;cription written upon them, <HI>God
will bring every work into judgment.</HI>&mdash;
Hence the haggard look, and the re&s;tle&s;s
couch, days never free from bitterne&s;s, and
nights given up to remor&s;e.</P>
<P>This remor&s;e will prey the deeper on
the bad man's heart, if it &s;hall happen, as
it &s;ometimes does, that there was a period
in his life when he was a different man;
when, having been educated by virtuous
parents in &s;ober and religious principles,
and being as yet uncorrupted by the world,
he pa&s;&s;ed his days without reproach or
blame. The recollection of what he then
felt, compared with the &s;tate into which
he has now brought him&s;elf by forfeited
<PB N="84" REF="95">
integrity and honour, will wring his heart
with &s;ad remembrance. &startq;Once I knew
what it was to enjoy all the comforts of
innocence, and to take plea&s;ure in the
thoughts of heaven, when my hands
were un&s;tained and my mind was pure.
Then I was ever cheerful, ea&s;y, and free.
Heaven and earth &s;eemed to &s;mile upon
me. My nights were peaceful, and my
days were plea&s;ant. Innocent joys and
comfortable hopes were ever at hand to
entertain my &s;olitary hours.&mdash;Where now
are the&s;e gone? Why am I thus &s;o al|tered
and changed from what I was, and
&s;o unea&s;y to my&s;elf? What, alas! have I
gained by tho&s;e worldly pur&s;uits and am|bitious
plans which &s;educed me from
the plain and &s;afe paths of integrity and
virtue!&endq;</P>
<P>SUCH are the wounds of the &s;pirit, occa|&s;ioned
either by folly, by pa&s;&s;ion, or by guilt,
and too often by a complication of all the
three together. For though they be of &s;epa|rate
con&s;ideration, and each of them may be
<PB N="85" REF="96">
felt in a different degree, yet they are &s;eldom
parted wholly a&s;under from one another.
Folly gives ri&s;e to unre&s;trained and di&s;|orderly
pa&s;&s;ions. The&s;e betray men into
atrocious crimes; and the wretched &s;inner
is &s;tung as by a three-headed &s;nake; at
once, reproached by rea&s;on for his folly,
agitated by &s;ome &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion, and tor|tured
with a con&s;cious &s;en&s;e of guilt.&mdash;
When the&s;e di&s;orders of the mind ari&s;e to
their height, they are, of all mi&s;eries, the mo&s;t
dreadful. The vulgar misfortunes of life,
poverty, &s;ickne&s;s, or the lo&s;s of friends, in
compari&s;on with them, are trivial evils.
Under &s;uch misfortunes, a man of tolerable
&s;pirit, or of a moderate &s;hare of virtue, will
be able to find &s;ome con&s;olation. But
under the other, he can find none. What
is but too deci&s;ive as to the degree in which
they &s;urpa&s;s all external evils, they are
tho&s;e wounds of the &s;pirit, the &s;hame of
folly, the violence of pa&s;&s;ion, and the re|mor&s;e
for guilt, which have &s;o frequently
produced that fatal crime, &s;o much the re|proach
of our age and our country; which
<PB N="86" REF="97">
have driven men to the mo&s;t abhorred of
all evils, to death by their own hand, in
order to &s;eek relief from a life too embit|tered
to be endured.&mdash;Far from each of
us be &s;uch de&s;perate calamities!&mdash;But, if
it be the certain tendency of tho&s;e
wounds of the heart, to introduce the
greate&s;t di&s;quietude and mi&s;ery into the
life of man, then, from what has been &s;aid,
let us be taught,</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, to give the mo&s;t
&s;erious and vigilant attention to the go|vernment
of our hearts. It may be
thought by &s;ome, that the formidable re|pre&s;entation
I have given of the mi&s;erable
effects of a wounded &s;pirit, attaches only
to them who have gone to the utmo&s;t
lengths in folly or pa&s;&s;ion; but that, by
&s;ome more temperate regulation of con|duct,
indulgence may be given, without
harm, to the free gratification of certain
favourite de&s;ires.&mdash;Be a&s;&s;ured, my brethren,
that, under ideas of this kind, there lies
much &s;elf-deception. Suppo&s;ing it in your
<PB N="87" REF="98">
power to &s;top at &s;ome given point without
ru&s;hing into the greate&s;t di&s;orders, &s;till you
would &s;uffer from the licence you had taken
to drop the government of your hearts.
The le&s;&s;er criminal never e&s;capes without
his &s;hare of puni&s;hment. In proportion
to the quantity you have drunk out of the
poi&s;oned cup of plea&s;ure, you will feel
your inward health and foundne&s;s im|paired;
or, to follow the metaphor of the
text, not by a deep wound only, but
by every &s;lighter hurt given to the heart,
you will &s;uffer in that peace and tranquil|lity
which makes the comfort of life.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides this con&s;ideration, &s;trict at|tention
is the more requi&s;ite to the govern|ment
of the heart, as the fir&s;t introduction
to tho&s;e di&s;orders which &s;pread their con&s;e|quences
&s;o deep and wide, is for the mo&s;t part
gradual and in&s;en&s;ible, and made by latent
&s;teps. Did all the evil clearly &s;how it&s;elf
at the beginning, the danger would be le&s;s.
But we are imperceptibly betrayed, and
from one incautious attachment drawn on
to another, till the government of our hearts
<PB N="88" REF="99">
be at la&s;t utterly lo&s;t; and wounds in|flicted
there, which are not to be healed
without much &s;hame, penitence, and re|mor&s;e.&mdash;How much does this call for the
attention of youth in particular, who&s;e
raw and unexperienced minds are &s;o apt
to be caught by every new and enticing
object that is held forth to their pa&s;&s;ions?
How much does it concern them to be|ware
of the commencements of evil, and
to li&s;ten to the admonitions of the grave
and the wi&s;e, who have gone through
tho&s;e dangerous paths on which they are
beginning to enter? Let them never give
up their hearts profu&s;ely to any attachment,
without the countenance of rea&s;on and
religion. Let them &s;hut their ears to the
&s;eductions of folly and vice, and look with
wary eye to tho&s;e rocks on which &s;o many
others have &s;plit.&mdash;Nor is it only to youth
that this admonition belongs. To the
levities and pa&s;&s;ions of youth &s;ucceed the
more &s;ober follies of advancing years;
which, under a graver appearance, are no
le&s;s liable to &s;eize and wound the heart.

occa&s;ion to &s;end forth de&s;troying angels
again&s;t them; the thunder which is ever
in his hands, needs not be pointed at the
heads of the guilty. He need only leave
them to them&s;elves; and pre&s;ently their
<HI>wickedne&s;s begins to reprove them, and their
back&s;lidings to correct them,</HI> till they fully &s;ee
and feel what an <HI>evil thing and bitter it
was, to depart from the Lord their God.</HI>
Con&s;cious, while their hearts are bleeding
within them, that they are only <HI>reaping
the fruit of their own doings,</HI> the &s;en&s;e of
de&s;erving what they &s;uffer, both aggravates
the &s;uffering, and forces them to acknow|ledge
the ju&s;tice of it.</P>
<P>When we behold &s;uch plain marks of
wi&s;e and ju&s;t government taking place
among men, who &s;hall take upon him to
&s;ay that all things come alike to all men,
and that there is no more than a promi&s;|cuous
di&s;tribution of good and evil by Pro|vidence
<PB N="92" REF="103">
on earth? However it may &s;eem
in appearance, it is far from being &s;o in
reality. We look to the out&s;ide of things.
We are dazzled with that tin&s;el glare which
pro&s;perity &s;ometimes throws around the
worthle&s;s and the wicked. But what is
that to true happine&s;s and &s;elf-enjoyment?
often, how little connected with it? Could
you look into the hearts of men, another
&s;cene would open. You would &s;ee many
a heart wounded and bleeding in &s;ecret,
from a guilty con&s;cience and remembered
crimes, while gay looks were affectedly put
on before $he world. Comparing this
galled and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;tate of mind, with
the free and ea&s;y, the light and di&s;encum|bered
&s;pirit of a worthy and virtuous man,
even under the pre&s;&s;ures of life, you would
forbear to charge Providence, and would
readily acknowledge, that though the exter|nal
di&s;tribution of the world's goods be pro|mi&s;cuous,
the internal allotment of happine&s;s
is mea&s;ured by the real characters of men.
&mdash;On the whole, let us hold fa&s;t by this
great truth, and by it govern our lives,
<PB N="93" REF="104">
that every man's real happine&s;s or mi&s;ery
is made, by the appointment of the Creator,
to depend more on him&s;elf, and on the
proper government of his mind and heart,
than upon any external thing, or than
upon all external things put together; that
for tho&s;e who &s;erve God, and &s;tudy to keep
their con&s;cience clear from guilt, God hath

<Q>We know that all Things work together for
Good to them that love God, to them who
are the Called according to his purpo&s;e.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AMONG many antient philo&s;ophers it
was a favourite tenet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. V.</NOTE> that all &s;eeming
di&s;orders in the world are rendered &s;ub|&s;ervient
to the order and perfection of the
univer&s;e; or, that all things work to|gether
for the good of the whole: But to
this good of the whole, they conceived the
intere&s;t of individuals to be oft-times
<PB N="95" REF="106">
obliged to yield. The revelation of the
Go&s;pel has opened to us a higher and more
comfortable pro&s;pect. For it a&s;&s;ures us not
only of the direct tendency of all things to
general order, but to the con&s;ummate hap|pine&s;s
of every individual who loves and
&s;erves God. While the Deity is ever car|rying
on the general &s;y&s;tem of things to its
proper perfection, the intere&s;t of no one
good man is &s;acrificed in any point to pro|mote
this end&punc; but his life is, at the &s;ame
time, a &s;y&s;tem complete within it&s;elf, where
all things are made to con&s;pire for bringing
about his felicity. <HI>We know,</HI> &s;ays the
Apo&s;tle in my text, that is, we are a&s;&s;ured,
not by doubtful rea&s;onings with regard to
which the wi&s;e&s;t might be perplexed, but
by a divine promi&s;e on which the &s;imple
can firmly rely, that <HI>all things work together
for good to them that love God, to them who
are the called according to his purpo&s;e.</HI>&mdash;This
is that capital encouragement of re|ligion,
which virtually contains in it&s;elf all
the other promi&s;es made in Scripture to
the righteous, and, like a full and exuberant
<PB N="96" REF="107">
fountain, divides it&s;elf into a thou&s;and
&s;treams to refre&s;h the life of man with con|&s;olation
and joy. It will therefore de&s;erve
our very full and particular con&s;ideration,
both as to the extent of encouragement
given, and the evidence on which our a&s;|&s;urance
of it re&s;ts.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t thing which &s;hould here draw
our attention is, the character of tho&s;e to
whom the encouragement of the text is
appropriated. For it is evidently not given
indi&s;eriminately to all, but limited to &s;uch
as <HI>love God,</HI> and <HI>are the called according to
his purpo&s;e;</HI> that is, cho&s;en by him to eternal
life. But left the latter part of this de|&s;cription
&s;hould appear too &s;ecret and my&s;|terious
to afford the encouragement in|tended,
it is cleared up by the fir&s;t and ex|planatory
character, <HI>them that love God.</HI>
Here is &s;omething plain and &s;atisfactory on
which we can re&s;t. We need not &s;ay, Who
&s;hall a&s;cend into heaven in order to bring us
down from thence any information, whe|ther
our names be written in the book of
<PB N="97" REF="108">
life? It is &s;ufficient to look into our&s;elves,
and the &s;tate of our heart. <HI>The word is
very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth and in thy
heart, that thou maye&s;t do it</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxx. 14.</NOTE>. They that
<HI>love God,</HI> and they who are <HI>the called ac|cording
to his purpo&s;e,</HI> are the &s;ame. Di|vine
love is the &s;acred character which
marks tho&s;e who are <HI>&s;ealed unto the day
of redemption.</HI>&mdash;This love of God is not to
be under&s;tood as &s;ignifying merely &s;ome
occa&s;ional ardour of affection: it imports
that &s;teady principle of goodne&s;s which
becomes the &s;pring of a pure and virtuous
life. The &s;ame character is here meant,
which is de&s;cribed in other pa&s;&s;ages of
&s;cripture, by <HI>fearing and &s;erving God.</HI> They
who truly love God, are they who love and
imitate the divine perfections; they who
love and obey the divine laws; they who
love and pur&s;ue the divine approbation,
as the great aim of their life.&mdash;Keeping
this important article ever in view as a
nece&s;&s;ary limitation of the gracious decla|ration
<PB N="98" REF="109">
in the text, let us proceed to exa|mine
the full extent of that encourage|ment
which it affords.</P>
<P>WE begin with con&s;idering what the
<HI>good</HI> is, for which it is here &s;aid that all
things work in favour of the righteous.
It is a term &s;u&s;ceptible of very different
acceptations. For many things appear good
to &s;ome, which do not appear &s;o to others;
nay, the &s;ame things which have appeared
to our&s;elves good at one time, have been
far from appearing good at another. A&s;|&s;uredly
that <HI>good</HI> which God promi&s;es as
the reward of his &s;ervants, mu&s;t be &s;ome|what
worthy of God to be&s;tow; &s;ome|what
that depends not on the fluctuation
of fancy and opinion, and that is not liable
to change with the change of times. It
mu&s;t be &s;ome good of a fixed and perma|nent
nature, which will be felt as &s;uch in
every &s;ituation and period of our exi&s;tence.
But it is evident that &s;uch characters are
not applicable to the external advantages
of the world, riches, &s;ame, and honours.
<PB N="99" REF="110">
The&s;e may occa&s;ionally be de&s;irable, and at
&s;ome times confer &s;atisfaction on the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or.
But be&s;ides their uncertain and tran|&s;ient
duration, they are far from conferring
&s;atisfaction at all times, even when they la&s;t.
On the contrary, it is a certain fact, and ma|nife&s;t
to general ob&s;ervation, that a man may
po&s;&s;e&s;s all the external advantages of fortune,
and lead withal a very mi&s;erable life. Sup|po&s;e
him to be di&s;quieted in his own mind
by envy, jealou&s;y, revenge, or other violent
pa&s;&s;ions, and hara&s;&s;ed with a guilty con|&s;cience,
&s;uch a man cannot be &s;aid to have
attained what is <HI>good.</HI> Would it have been
worthy of the Supreme Being to have
flattered his &s;ervants with the hope only
of a good &s;o fallacious, that in certain cir|cum&s;tances
it might be con&s;i&s;tent with the
greate&s;t mi&s;ery?&mdash;No: that good, for the
&s;ake of which he makes all things work to
tho&s;e that love him, mu&s;t be founded in
the improvement and perfection of their na|ture
in wi&s;dom, grace, and virtue; in their
good con&s;idered as rational and immortal
beings; productive of a felicity which is
within them, and &s;hall abide with them
<PB N="100" REF="111">
for ever. While we look only to a pre|&s;ent
momentary &s;atisfaction, the Divine
Being, in con&s;ulting our welfare, provides
for the whole of our exi&s;tence in time and
eternity; connects the pre&s;ent with the
future; and by his beneficent decree, ordains
for each of his &s;ervants, that which, upon
the whole, is <HI>the be&s;t.</HI>&mdash;While <HI>to the &s;inner
he giveth &s;ore travel, to gather and to heap
up; he giveth to a man that is good in his
&s;ight, wi&s;dom, and knowledge, and joy</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. ii. 26.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HAVING a&s;certained the &s;en&s;e in which
we are to under&s;tand <HI>the good</HI> for which God
maketh all things to work, we proceed to
con&s;ider what is included in the extent of
the expre&s;&s;ion, of <HI>all things working for this
good.</HI> In general, it includes all that hap|pens
to good men in this world; every
&s;tation and condition in which they are
placed; every circum&s;tance in their lot,
from the beginning to the end of their
lives. Nothing be&s;als them fortuitou&s;ly,
nothing happens in vain or without a
<PB N="101" REF="112">
meaning; but every event po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es its
proper and de&s;tined place, and forms a link
in that great chain of cau&s;es which is ap|pointed
to carry on their improvement
and felicity. As all the rivers upon the
face of the globe, however circuitous they
may be in their progre&s;s, and however
oppo&s;ite in their cour&s;e, yet meet at la&s;t in
the ocean, and there contribute to increa&s;e
the ma&s;s of waters; &s;o all the &s;eemingly
di&s;cordant events in the life of a good man
are made to pre&s;erve, upon the whole, an
unerring tendency to his good, and to
concur and con&s;pire for promoting it at the
la&s;t. What a noble and &s;ublime view does
this pre&s;ent of the &s;upreme dominion of
Providence, and of its care exerci&s;ed over
every righteous man!</P>
<P>When we de&s;cend to a more particular
examination of what is included in the ex|pre&s;&s;ion
here u&s;ed, of <HI>all things,</HI> we may
ob&s;erve, fir&s;t, that it includes a &s;tate of
worldly pro&s;perity. For &s;ometimes this is
appointed to fall to the &s;hare of God's &s;er|vants;
nay, their worth and virtue have
<PB N="102" REF="113">
often been the means of bringing it about.
But it is not one of tho&s;e things which
are good in their own nature, till God
makes it work for that purpo&s;e. What
numbers of men has it poi&s;oned and de|&s;troyed,
cheri&s;hing the growth of wanton|ne&s;s
and folly; and implanting in their
brea&s;ts the &s;eeds of tho&s;e bad pa&s;&s;ions which
&s;pring up into many a crime! From &s;uch
evils, the pro&s;perity of good men is guarded
by God. The poi&s;on is extracted from
it, and the &s;alutary part only left. It is
rendered to them a comfortable and u&s;eful
enjoyment of life, affording opportunity for
the exerci&s;e of many virtues, which other|wi&s;e
would not have come within their
&s;phere.</P>
<P>But, <HI>among all things that work for good,</HI>
it is probable that the evils of this life were
particularly de&s;igned to be included, as
what we might have lea&s;t expected to be
&s;ub&s;ervient to that purpo&s;e. It is never|thele&s;s
certain, that from the di&s;cipline of
adver&s;ity, the mo&s;t &s;alutary improvements
of human nature have been often derived.
<PB N="103" REF="114">
In that &s;evere &s;chool the predominant errors
of the mind have been corrected, the in|temperance
of the giddy &s;pirit has been
allayed and reformed, and that manly &s;e|riou&s;ne&s;s
acquired which is the foundation
of true wi&s;dom. By the <HI>&s;adne&s;s of the
countenance, the heart</HI> of the &s;ufferer <HI>has
been made better;</HI> he has been trained up to
fortitude of mind, improved in humanity
to men, and formed to the habits of de|votion
and re&s;ignation to God.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, it is only <HI>if need be,</HI>
as the Apo&s;tle Peter &s;peaks<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 6.</NOTE>, that the
righteous <HI>are left for a &s;ea&s;on in heavine&s;s.</HI>
If it be certain that all things work for their
good, it follows of cour&s;e, that there is no
&s;uperfluous &s;everity, no needle&s;s or unne|ce&s;&s;ary
trouble to them, in the con&s;titution
of things. Their afflictions never befal
without a cau&s;e, nor are &s;ent but upon a
proper errand. The&s;e &s;torms are never al|lowed
to ri&s;e, but in order to di&s;pel &s;ome
noxious vapours, and to re&s;tore &s;alubrity
<PB N="104" REF="115">
to the moral atmo&s;phere.&mdash;Herein ap|pears,
if we may be allowed &s;o to &s;peak,
the wonderful art and &s;kill of the Supreme
Artificer, the profound depth of the divine
wi&s;dom, in extracting, from di&s;tre&s;&s;es and
&s;orrows, the materials of peace and felicity.
Nor are only the external calamities of
good men &s;ub&s;ervient to this purpo&s;e; but
their internal in$irmiti$s, their very failings
and errors, are made, by the powerful in|fluence
of God's grace, to contribute ulti|mately
to their good. They are thereby
in&s;tructed in the knowledge of them&s;elves;
they are properly humbled by the di&s;co|very
of their own weakne&s;s; and trained
to that becoming &s;pirit of contrition and
returning repentance, which is repre&s;ented
as giving joy to the angels in heaven. He
who <HI>maketh the wrath of man to prai&s;e him,</HI> is
not deficient in wi&s;dom and power, to make
even the failings of his &s;ervants, in this im|perfect
&s;tate of human nature, redound at
la&s;t to his own glory, and to their good.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not e&s;cape ob&s;ervation, that the
text &s;ugge&s;ts, not merely that all things
<PB N="105" REF="116">
prove good in the i&s;&s;ue, or eventually turn
out to the benefit of the righteous, but that
they <HI>work for it.</HI> This expre&s;&s;ion carries
particular energy. It imports that <HI>all
things</HI> are &s;o formed by God, as to become
active cau&s;es of happine&s;s to tho&s;e who
love him. His infinite wi&s;dom gives to
things in them&s;elves mo&s;t unapt, an apti|tude
and fitne&s;s to fulfil his own great
ends; di&s;po&s;es and prepares them for their
proper effects; and makes dangers and evils
his in&s;truments for accompli&s;hing the fe|licity
of his &s;ervants. There is a certain
operation and proce&s;s always going on, by
which, though we are in&s;en&s;ible of it, all
things are con&s;tantly advancing towards a
happy i&s;&s;ue. In the &s;ame manner as the
operation of natural cau&s;es, though &s;low
and unperceived, is &s;ure; as the &s;eed
which is &s;own in the ground is every mo|ment
unfolding it&s;elf; and though no eye
can trace the &s;teps of its progre&s;s, yet, with
a &s;ilent growth, is ripening and &s;hooting
forth its &s;talks; &s;o in the moral world,
throughout all the di&s;pen&s;ations of Provi|dence,
<PB N="106" REF="117">
there is the &s;ame latent, but certain
progre&s;s of the &s;eeds of virtue and holine&s;s,
tending towards perfection in the end.
<HI>Light is &s;$wn for the righteous,</HI> as the
P&s;almi&s;t beautifully employs this metaphor,
<HI>and gladne&s;s for the upright in heart</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;. xcvii. $word$.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid in the text, not only that all
things thus work, but that they <HI>work toge|ther
for good;</HI> intimating that they are
made to con&s;pire and concur with one
another, for bringing about what is be&s;t
on the whole. Taken &s;ingly and indivi|dually,
it might be difficult to conceive
how each event wrought for good. They
mu&s;t be viewed in their con&s;equences and
effects; con&s;idered in all their dependencies
and connections, as links hanging together
to form one exten&s;ive chain. It is by
adju&s;ting into one con&s;i&s;tent whole, the
various events that fill up human life;
arranging in the happie&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;ion all the
occurrences of that complicated &s;eene; and
bending to his own purpo&s;e things which
<PB N="107" REF="118">
appear mo&s;t oppo&s;ite and contrary, that the
Almighty accompli&s;hes his great plan in
behalf of tho&s;e who <HI>love him, and are the
called according to his purpo&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH is that great edifice of encourage|ment
and hope, which the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t
hath reared for the con&s;olation of tho&s;e
who &s;incerely love and &s;erve God. It re|mains
now that we examine what the pil|lars
are on which &s;o mighty an edifice re&s;ts.
The Apo&s;tle &s;peaks, you &s;ee, in a &s;train of
full a&s;&s;urance. He does not &s;ay, we be|lieve,
or we hope, but <HI>we know,</HI> that all
things work together for good.&mdash;Let us
con&s;ider,</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, the evidence in &s;up|port
of this doctrine, which ari&s;es from
the perfections of the divine nature. In
general, that God is good to all, and that
his goodne&s;s is e&s;pecially exerted in behalf
of the righteous, is a principle of religion,
which none will di&s;pute. The only que&s;|tion
is, how far that goodne&s;s extends,
<PB N="108" REF="119">
and whether we can conceive it as ex|tending
to all that is implied in the text.
Something, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, there is
a&s;toni&s;hing, and on fir&s;t view almo&s;t incre|dible
in the a&s;&s;ertion, that amid&s;t that in|finite
combination of events which carry on
the general order of the univer&s;e, nothing
&s;hall ever happen but what advances the hap|pine&s;s
of each good man; and which &s;hall
tend to his private intere&s;t, as much as if his
exi&s;tence had formed a &s;y&s;tem by it&s;elf.
But how a&s;toni&s;hing &s;oever this may &s;eem
to us, let us fir&s;t reflect, that this &s;uppo&s;es
no effort beyond the power of Him who
is Almighty, or beyond the &s;kill of Him
who is infinite in wi&s;dom. We mu&s;t not
mea&s;ure divine operations by the feeble
energies of man. God is the fir&s;t cau&s;e of
all that exi&s;ts and acts. All events are, at
every moment, in his hands. Nothing
can make any re&s;i&s;tance to his purpo&s;e,
or fall out in any way be&s;ide, or beyond
his plan. At one glance he perceives how
all things are going on throughout his uni|ver&s;e.
Not the minute&s;t object is over|looked
<PB N="109" REF="120">
by Him. No multiplicity of affairs
di&s;tracts Him: for to the &s;upreme intelli|gence,
all things are pre&s;ent at once; and to
the concerns of every good man, his ob|&s;ervation
and attention reach as fully as if
there were no other object under his go|vernment.</P>
<P>As there is nothing, therefore, in the pro|mi&s;e
of the text, which divine power and
wi&s;dom cannot effect, &s;o neither is there
any thing in it but what divine goodne&s;s
gives us rea&s;on to believe &s;hall be fulfilled.
The goodne&s;s of the Supreme$ Being is
very different from that of men. Among
them, it is a principle occa&s;ionally operating,
but always limited, and always &s;ubject to
alteration and change. Their benefits,
though liberally be&s;towed at one time, will
at another time be &s;topped by the inter|vention
of contrary pa&s;&s;ions. Their bene|volence
decays; &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and indifference
&s;ucceed. But in the nature of the Deity,
there is no principle which can produce
alteration or change in his benevolent pur|po&s;e
once formed. <HI>Without variablene&s;s or
<PB N="110" REF="121">
&s;hadow of turning,</HI> whom he hath once
<HI>loved he loveth to the end. The gifts and
calling of God are without repentance.</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">John, xiii. 1. Rom, xi. 29.</NOTE>.
His goodne&s;s therefore con&s;i&s;ts, not in a
mere temporary effu&s;ion of ble&s;&s;ings, but
is permanent and &s;teady; leading him, not
&s;imply to be&s;tow &s;ome things that are
good, and then to &s;top, but to carry his
gracious purpo&s;e to the utmo&s;t; in every
in&s;tance to do what is be&s;t for his &s;ervants
on the whole, or in the words of the text,
to make <HI>all things work for their good.</HI></P>
<P>Let us now con&s;ider what it would im|port,
if any &s;ingle occurrence were to
happen in the cour&s;e of human affairs,
which had not a good de&s;ign; which did
not, in one form or other, promote the
benefit of the righteous. What would it
import, but that in &s;uch an in&s;tance, either
the divine power and wi&s;dom had fallen
&s;hort of their effect, or the divine goodne&s;s
had neglected and for&s;aken the virtuous?
It were bla&s;phemous to &s;uppo&s;e that the
<PB N="111" REF="122">
nature of the Deity was changed; or that
there were, in his government of the
world, &s;ome vacant &s;paces, or neglected in|tervals,
in which he &s;uffered the reins of
admini&s;tration to drop out of his hands,
and &s;ome evil principle to counteract his
general &s;y&s;tem. But as all &s;uch &s;uppo&s;i|tions
are manife&s;tly incon&s;i&s;tent with the
nature of that God in whom Chri&s;tians
believe, there appears to follow, from the
con&s;ideration of his perfections, evidence
next to demon&s;tration, for the truth of that
doctrine which the text contains.</P>
<P>BUT that we may not re&s;t its evidence
on our own rea&s;onings only, let us next
con&s;ider what di&s;covery of his high de&s;igns
God hath been plea&s;ed to make in the Re|velation
of the Go&s;pel. Here it is amply
&s;ufficient to have recour&s;e to one &s;ignal di&s;|pen&s;ation
of his government, the redemp|tion
of the world by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Hence
ari&s;es an argument which carries the mo&s;t
convincing force; and which accordingly,
in a few ver&s;es after the text, is employed
<PB N="112" REF="123">
by the Apo&s;tle in &s;upport of that doctrine
I have been illu&s;trating. <HI>He that &s;pared
not his own Son, but delivered him up for
us all, how &s;hall be not with him al&s;o, freely
give us all things?</HI>&mdash;Can we in any in|&s;tance
di&s;tru&s;t Him who hath given us
this highe&s;t proof of his love? If he
&s;crupled not to be&s;tow this be&s;t gift, is
there any other ble&s;&s;ing he will be inclined
to withhold? Having already done &s;o much,
will he leave incomplete his own great
work?&mdash;By the death of Chri&s;t, we are
taught in &s;cripture, that atonement was
made for &s;in. He underwent in his &s;uf|ferings
the puni&s;hment due to us. He is
&s;aid to have been <HI>wounded for our tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions,
and brui&s;ed for our iniquitics; to have
borne our &s;ins in his own body on the tree.</HI>
From this view of the doctrine of redemp|tion,
it naturally follows, that Chri&s;t having
purcha&s;ed for his followers the pardon of
their &s;ins, the afflictions they now undergo
are not properly to be con&s;idered as puni&s;h|ments,
but as cha&s;ti&s;ements intended for
their good&punc;&mdash;Add to this, that it is the pe|culiar
<PB N="113" REF="124">
province of our Lord in his pre&s;ent
exalted &s;tate, to admini&s;ter all things for
the good of his church. For this end his
regal power is employed. To this end
his mediation and interce&s;&s;ion are directed;
and either the&s;e mu&s;t in &s;ome ca&s;es prove
ineffectual, or it mu&s;t follow that all things
work for the good of them who love him.
As much evidence then as we have for
tho&s;e capital truths on which the whole of
Chri&s;tianity re&s;ts, the &s;ame we have for that
high encouragement afforded by the text.</P>
<P>It remains to take notice, in the la&s;t
place, of the expre&s;s and multiplied pro|mi&s;es
of the &s;acred Scripture to the &s;ame
purpo&s;e with that in the text. Though
the text alone might have appeared &s;uf|ficient
for our encouragement; yet, as re|peated
a&s;&s;urances of the &s;ame thing come
home with greater weight to the mind,
it hath plea&s;ed God to make this full pro|vi&s;ion
for confirming the tru&s;t and hope
of his &s;ervants: and there can be no doubt
that the plain and explicit words of the di|vine
promi&s;es have had the mo&s;t comfort|able
<PB N="114" REF="125">
influence on many who could not
&s;o well have &s;upported them&s;elves under
the trials of life, either by rea&s;onings taken
from the divine perfections, or by infer|ences
drawn from the doctrine of redemp|tion.
Accordingly, we are not left merely
to rea&s;on or to infer, but are in expre&s;s
terms told by God him&s;elf, that <HI>godline&s;s
&s;hall be pro&s;itable unto all things; that God
the Lord is a &s;un and a &s;hield, giving grace
and glory, and withholding no good thing
from them that walk uprightly; that no evil
&s;hall happen to the ju&s;t; for the Lord is their
keeper, who never &s;lumbers nor &s;leeps; that
his eyes are ever on the rig$$$ous; that
when they pa&s;s through the waters, be
will be with them, and through the rivers
they &s;hall not overflow them;</HI> and in fine
<HI>that all his paths are mercy and truth to
&s;uch as fear him, and keep his covenant</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">$ Tim. iv. 8. P&s;. lxxxiv. $i. P&s;. c$xi. 3, 4, &amp;c.</NOTE>.
The&s;e promi&s;es, and many more to the
&s;ame effect, with which the Scripture
abounds, plainly expre&s;s a particular care
<PB N="115" REF="126">
of Heaven exerci&s;ed about every &s;ingle
good man; they &s;ignify as real an interpo|&s;ition
of Providence, as if the laws of nature
had been &s;u&s;pended on his account.</P>
<P>The opinion entertained by &s;ome, that
the Providence of God ext$nds no farther
than to a general &s;uperintendance of the
laws of nature, without interpo&s;ing in the
particular concerns of individuals, is con|trary
both to rea&s;on and to &s;cripture. It
renders the government of the Almighty
altogether loo&s;e and contingent, and would
leave no ground for repo&s;ing any tru&s;t
under its protection. For the majority of
human affairs would then be allowed to
fluctuate in a fortuitous cour&s;e, without
moving in any regular direction, and
without tending to any one &s;cope. The
uniform doctrine of the &s;acred writings is,
that throughout the univer&s;e nothing hap|pens
without God; that his hand is ever
active, and his decree or permi&s;&s;ion inter|venes
in all; that nothing is too great or
unwieldy for his management, and nothing
&s;o minute and incon&s;iderable as to be below
<PB N="116" REF="127">
his in&s;pection and care. While he is
guiding the &s;un and the moon in their
cour&s;e through the Heavens; while in this
inferiour world he is ruling among empires,
<HI>&s;$illing the ragings of the waters and the
tumults of the people,</HI> he is at the &s;ame time
watching over the humble good man, who,
in the ob&s;curity of his cottage, is &s;erving
and wor&s;hipping Him. In order to ex|pre&s;s
this vigilance of Providence in the
&s;tronge&s;t terms, our Saviour him&s;elf has
&s;aid, that the very <HI>bairs of our head are all
numbered by God;</HI> and that <HI>while two &s;par|rows
are &s;old for a farhing, not one of
them falls to the ground without his plea|&s;ure.</HI>
The con&s;olation which this affords,
he applies to his di&s;ciples in what follows:
<HI>Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value
than many &s;parrows</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Matth. x. 30, $1.</NOTE>. It is on this doc|trine
of a &s;pecial and particular Providence
he grounds that exhortation again&s;t worldly
&s;olicitude and anxiety, which accords &s;o
fully with the argument we have been
<PB N="117" REF="128">
pur&s;uing; <HI>your Heavenly Father knoweth
what things ye have need of; take therefore
no thought for the morrow; but &s;eek fir&s;t
the kingdom of God, and his righteou&s;ne&s;s; and
all the&s;e things &s;hall be added unto you</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Matth. vi. 33.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THUS it has been &s;hown on what
grounds our a&s;&s;ured belief re&s;ts of the de|claration
in the text, that all things are
made to work for the good of the righteous.
It is not a promi&s;e which admits of ambi|guity,
and which we might be afraid to
interpret to its full extent. It is on every
&s;ide confirmed by the mo&s;t &s;ober rea&s;onings
we can form from the divine perfections;
by the whole tenour of the di&s;pen&s;ation of
redemption; by many repeated a&s;&s;urances
given us in the &s;acred writings.</P>
<P>THE great objection, I am aware, that
will be &s;tarted by many again&s;t the whole
of what has been advanced in this di&s;cour&s;e,
is founded on the &s;eeming prevalence of
<PB N="118" REF="129">
evil and di&s;order in the world. This, it
will be &s;aid, is &s;o con&s;picuous, as to be
incon&s;i&s;tent with the repre&s;entation that
has been given of a Supreme Being, who
attends, in every in&s;tance, to the welfare
of every good man. The pre&s;ent &s;tate of
the world may be &s;u&s;pected to carry more
the appearance of a conflict between two
oppo&s;ite principles of good and evil, who
divide the empire of the world, and of
cour&s;e create a mixture of &s;ome good things
with more that are evil. How often, it
will be &s;aid, are the be&s;t men in&s;en&s;ible of
any &s;uch gradual improvement, or any &s;uch
tendency in the general cour&s;e of things,
as has been repre&s;ented, to promote their
intere&s;t; but on the contrary, left comfort|le&s;s
and forlorn, in the mid&s;t of &s;urround|ing
pro&s;perous vice, to mourn over di&s;ap|pointed
hopes and bitter &s;orrows, without
receiving the lea&s;t mark of favourable in|tentions
from Heaven? Hence the excla|mations
they have often uttered; &startq;Where
is the Lord, and where the &s;ceptre of
righteou&s;ne&s;s and truth? Doth God in|deed
<PB N="119" REF="130">
&s;ee, and is there knowledge in the
Mo&s;t High? Or hath He <HI>forgotten to be
gracious, and in anger &s;hut up his tender
mercies?&endq;</HI></P>
<P>Now, in an&s;wer to &s;uch objections, let us
con&s;ider how much rea&s;on there is for
a&s;cribing tho&s;e dark and doubtful appear|ances,
to the narrow and confined views
which our &s;tate allows us to take. The
de&s;igns of the Almighty are enlarged and
va&s;t. They comprehend not only the
whole of our pre&s;ent exi&s;tence, but they
include worlds unknown, and &s;tretch for|wards
into eternity. Hence much dark|ne&s;s
and my&s;tery mu&s;t of cour&s;e re&s;t at
pre&s;ent on the admini&s;tration of God; and
we, who &s;ee only &s;o &s;mall a portion of a
great and complicated &s;y&s;tem, mu&s;t be
very inadequate judges, both of the ten|dency
of each part, and of the i&s;&s;ue of the
whole. We behold no more than the out|&s;ide
of things. Our views glide over the
&s;urface; and even along that &s;urface, they
extend but a &s;hort way. But under the &s;ur|face
there lie hidden &s;prings, that are &s;et
<PB N="120" REF="131">
in motion by a &s;uperiour hand, and are
bringing forwards revolutions unfore&s;een
by us. There are <HI>wheels moving within
wheels,</HI> as the prophet Ez$kiel beheld in
my&s;terious vi&s;ion<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Ez$k. x. 10.</NOTE>.&mdash;We, mea&s;uring all
things by the &s;hortne&s;s of our own dura|tion,
are con&s;tantly accelerating our de|&s;igns
to their period. We are eager in
advancing rapidly towards the completion
of our wi&s;hes. But it is not &s;o with God.
In his &s;ight, <HI>a thou&s;and years are as one day:</HI>
and while his infinitely wi&s;e plans are con|tinually
advancing with &s;ure progre&s;s, that
progre&s;s to our impatience appears &s;low.
Let us have patience for a while, and
the&s;e plans &s;hall in due time be developed,
and will explain them&s;elves. His language
to us is, <HI>What I do thou knowe&s;t not now;
but thou &s;halt know hereafter</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John, xiii. 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Let us attend to the analogy of Nature.
We &s;hall find it to hold very generally,
both in the moral and natural world, that
nothing ari&s;es &s;uddenly to the perfection
<PB N="121" REF="132">
of its &s;tate; that all improvement is carried
on by lei&s;urely gradations; and that mo&s;t
frequently it is through har&s;h and unpro|mi&s;ing
beginnings, things are brought to a
favourable conclu&s;ion. This might be il|lu&s;trated
by many examples.&mdash;Take, for
one in&s;tance, the progre&s;s of the &s;ea&s;ons.
Who that for the fir&s;t time beheld the
earth, in mid&s;t of winter, bound up with
fro&s;t, or drenched in floods of rain, or
covered with &s;now, would have imagined
that Nature, in this dreary and torpid &s;tate,
was working towards its own renovation
in the &s;pring? Yet we by experience know
that tho&s;e vici&s;&s;itudes of winter are nece&s;|&s;ary
for fertilizing the earth; and that
under wintry rains and &s;nows lie concealed
the &s;eeds of tho&s;e ro&s;es that are to blo&s;&s;om
in the &s;pring; of tho&s;e fruits that are to
ripen in &s;ummer; and of the corn and
wine, which are, in harve&s;t, to make glad
the heart of man. We perhaps reli&s;h not
&s;uch di&s;agreeable commencements of the
plea&s;ing &s;ea&s;on. It would be more agree|able
<PB N="122" REF="133">
to us, to be always entertained with a
fair and clear atmo&s;phere, with cloudle&s;s
&s;kies, and perpetual &s;un&s;hine: while yet,
in &s;uch climates as we have mo&s;t know|ledge
of, the earth, were it always to re|main
in &s;uch a &s;tate, would refu&s;e to yield
its fruits; and in the mid&s;t of our imagined
&s;cenes of beauty, the &s;tarved inhabitants
would pcri&s;h for want of food.&mdash;Let us
therefore quietly &s;ubmit to Nature and to
Providence. Let us conceive this life, of
who&s;e evils we &s;o often complain, to be
the winter of our exi&s;tence. Then the
rains mu&s;t fall, and the winds mu&s;t roar
around us. But, &s;heltering our&s;elves, as we
can, under a good con&s;cience, and under
faith and tru&s;t in God, let us wait till the
&s;pring arrive. For a &s;pring, an eternal
&s;pring, awaits the people of God. In the
new heavens and the new earth no &s;torms
&s;hall any more ari&s;e, nor any unplea&s;ing
vici&s;&s;itudes of &s;ea&s;on return. It &s;hall then
at la&s;t appear how former &s;ufferings have
produced their proper effect; how the
<PB N="123" REF="134">
tempe&s;ts of life have tended to bring on an
everla&s;ting calm; in fine, how <HI>all things
have wrought together for good to them
that love God, and who are the called ac|cording
to his purpo&s;e.</HI></P>

of the highe&s;t ble&s;&s;ings is apt to de|preciate
<PB N="125" REF="136">
them in our e&s;teem. This un|happy
weakne&s;s &s;hows it&s;elf, not only with
re&s;pect to the light of the &s;un, and the
beauties of nature, which we have been long
accu&s;tomed to behold, but al&s;o with re|&s;pect
to health, peace, religion, and liberty.
Let any one of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings have been
long familiar to us; let a tract of time
have effaced the remembrance of the di&s;|tre&s;s
which we &s;uffered from the want of

&s;edition?&mdash;When government has now,
for wi&s;e and proper rea&s;ons, called us to|gether
in a religious a&s;&s;embly, our thoughts
cannot be more &s;uitably employed than in
reviewing the grounds on which, as good
Chri&s;tians and faithful citizens, we have
rea&s;on to entertain the warme&s;t affection
for our native country, and to put a ju&s;t
value on that con&s;titution of government,
civil and &s;acred, under which it is placed.
&mdash;In the words of the text, you &s;ee with
what zeal the heart of the pious P&s;almi&s;t
glowed for the pro&s;perity of his country.
By the accumulation of expre&s;&s;ions which
he employs, and the variety of topics he
&s;ugge&s;ts, you &s;ee the fervour with which
this &s;ubject animated his heart.&mdash;It will be
proper to con&s;ider, fir&s;t, the grounds on
which love for our country re&s;ts; and next,
the duties to which this affection naturally
gives ri&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT, before entering on any of tho&s;e
topics, it may be proper to take notice of
the &s;peculations of &s;ome pretended philo|&s;ophers,
<PB N="127" REF="138">
who repre&s;ent the love of our
country as hardly entitled to any place
among the virtues. They affect to con|&s;ider
it as a mere prejudice of education;
a narrow attachment, which tends to ope|rate
again&s;t more enlarged intere&s;ts. We
ought, &s;ay they, to view our&s;elves as citi|zens
of the world, and extend our benevo|lence,
equally, to all nations and all man|kind.
&mdash;Nothing can be more empty and
$utile than &s;uch rea&s;onings. The wi&s;dom
of our Creator hath linked us by the ties
of natural affection, fir&s;t to our families
and children; next to our brothers, rela|tions,
and friends; then to our acquaint|ance,
and to the &s;everal &s;ocieties and com|munities
to which we belong. By in&s;tincts
implanted in our nature, He has formed
our hearts to enter readily into their
intere&s;ts; and has thus directed our
benevolence to act primarily within that
&s;phere, where its exertions can be mo&s;t
powerful and mo&s;t u&s;eful. It is evident,
that by acting on this plan, the general
welfare is promoted in a much higher de|gree,
<PB N="128" REF="139">
than if our &s;ocial affections had no
particular direction given them, but were
to float, as it were, in empty &s;pace, with|out
any more determined object on which
to act than the whole human race, where
they never could act with any effect. He
who contends that he is not bound to have
any more concern for the intere&s;ts of Great
Britain, than for tho&s;e of France, or any
other country, ought to hold, on the &s;ame
grounds, that he is under no obligation to
con&s;ult the welfare of his children and
family, his brothers and friends, more than
that of the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;tranger; being
equally connected, as he holds, with all, by
the common brotherhood of the human
race. It is much to be &s;u&s;pected, that this
wonderful exten&s;ive philanthropy is only
the language of tho&s;e who have no affec|tions
at all; or perhaps, that it is the
language a&s;&s;umed by &s;ome, who, bearing
in their hearts a &s;ecret preference to
the intere&s;ts of another country above
their own, but a preference which they
choo&s;e not to avow, affect to cover it
<PB N="129" REF="140">
under this di&s;gui&s;e, of a liberal, enlarged
&s;pirit.</P>
<P>Let us, my friends, di&s;claiming all &s;uch
refinements of fal&s;e philo&s;ophy, and fol|lowing
the dictates of plain good &s;en&s;e, and
natural affection, re&s;olve to love our native
country, and in every proper way to &s;how
our attachment to it. This was the &s;pirit
which &s;o honourably di&s;tingui&s;hed patriots,
heroes, and legi&s;lators of old, and has tran&s;|mitted
their names with veneration to po&s;|terity;
while they, who felt no affection
for the country to which they belonged, or
who were treacherous to its intere&s;ts, have
been &s;tigmatized with infamy among
all civilized nations. I admit that there
have been occa&s;ions, on which attachment
to a particular country has been pur&s;ued
to a very unju&s;tifiable length. Wherever
it has led the natives of one country to
&s;tate them&s;elves as enemies to the re&s;t of
mankind, and to endeavour at aggrandizing
them&s;elves by ruining all around them, the
pretended love of their country is then be|come
no other than a con&s;piracy again&s;t all
<PB N="130" REF="141">
other nations, and in&s;tead of being a virtue is
the offspring of ambition, pride, and vanity.</P>
<P>I proceed now to &s;how the ju&s;t grounds
on which it becomes us to be zealous for
the welfare of that happy i&s;land, to which
we have the honour and the ble&s;&s;ing to
belong. Let us con&s;ider our native coun|try
in three lights; as the &s;eat of private
enjoyment and happine&s;s; as the &s;eat of
true religion; as the &s;eat of laws, liberty,
and good government.</P>
<P>I. As the &s;eat of all our be&s;t enjoyments
in private life. There, my brethren, after
we fir&s;t drew breath, was our tender in|fancy
reared with care; there, our inno|cent
childhood &s;ported; there, our carele&s;s
youth grew up amid&s;t companions and
friends; there, our deare&s;t connexions were
formed; there, after having pa&s;&s;ed the
happie&s;t years of our life, we look forward
for our old age to re&s;t in peace.&mdash;The&s;e
are circum&s;tances which endear, and ought
to endear a home, a native land, to every
human heart. If there be any names
<PB N="131" REF="142">
known among men that awaken tender
&s;entiments in the brea&s;t, the names of fa|ther,
mother, &s;pou&s;e, child, brother, &s;i&s;ter,
or friend, the&s;e all recall our thoughts to
our native land, and cannot, even in idea,
be &s;eparated from it. When we name our
own country, we name the &s;pot of the
earth within which all that is mo&s;t dear
to us lies. To be long ab&s;ent from it, is
a circum&s;tance of di&s;tre&s;s; but to be ex|cluded
from the hope of ever returning to
it, &s;inks the &s;pirits of the worthy and the
brave into extreme depre&s;&s;ion. Its very
du&s;t appears to them to be precious. Its
well-known fields, and mountains, and
rivers, become, in their eyes, a &s;ort of con|&s;$crated
ground; the remembrance of
which often touches the heart with &s;en&s;a|tions
of more tender joy, than can be rai&s;ed
by &s;cenes more rich, and objects more
&s;plendid, in any foreign land.</P>
<P>The&s;e are feelings, which nature, or ra|ther
the God of nature, has implanted in
the mind of man; and ba&s;e and vile is he
who &s;tudies to craze them, intimately con|nected
<PB N="132" REF="143">
as they are with our very be&s;t af|fections.&mdash;Can
we think, my friends, how
long we have fat <HI>under our vine and our
fig-tree,</HI> in peace and joy, encircled by our
families and friends, in that happy land we
po&s;&s;e&s;s; and, with this plea&s;ing remembrance
dwelling on our minds, can we think with
indifference of any danger which threatens
the welfare of that country which has been
the mother, the nur&s;e, the guardian of us
all? Can we think without horror, of fo|reign
inva&s;ion laying wa&s;te our fruitful
and &s;miling fields, or of lawle&s;s anarchy
and tumultuary mobs attacking our peace|ful
habitations?&mdash;No! <HI>Peace be within thy
walls, and pro&s;perity within thy palaces,</HI> will
ever be the earne&s;t prayer of every vir|tuous
man; <HI>for my brethren and compa|nions'
&s;ake, I will ever &s;ay, Peace be within
thee!</HI></P>
<P>II. WE love our country as the &s;eat
of true religion. Freed from the domi|nion
of Popi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition and darkne&s;s
which &s;o long over&s;pread the earth, here
<PB N="133" REF="144">
the light of the ble&s;&s;ed reformation con|tinues
to &s;hine in its greate&s;t &s;plendour.
Here the forms of religious wor&s;hip are
encumbered with no pageantry of vain
rites; but, agreeably to God's word, are
plain and &s;imple, yet &s;olemn and venerable.
Religion has among us neither been the
engine of eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyranny, nor the
in&s;trument of princely de&s;poti&s;m. It has
maintained a proper alliance with the re|gular
government of the &s;tate, and the
order of public tranquillity. The church
that has been e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, in the
two &s;eparate divi&s;ions of the i&s;land, is &s;uited
to the genius and di&s;po&s;itions of the people
in each. While to the e&s;tabli&s;hed church
is given that protection and &s;upport from
government, which both the intere&s;ts of
religion and the welfare of the &s;tate render
proper and due; yet no rigid conformity
to it is exacted. All per&s;ecution for con|&s;cience
&s;ake, is unknown. They who, in
their modes of thinking, or in their religious
forms, differ from the e&s;tabli&s;hed church,
are at full liberty, without reproach, to
<PB N="134" REF="145">
wor&s;hip God according to their own opi|nions
and the rites of their fathers, as long
as they infringe not the public tranquillity,
nor di&s;turb the &s;tate.</P>
<P>I now a&s;k, what e&s;tabli&s;hment of religion
more friendly to public happine&s;s$ could
be de&s;ired or framed? How zealous ought
we to be for its pre&s;ervation? How much
on our guard again&s;t every danger which
threatens to trouble or overthrow it?&mdash;
Can there be any among us &s;o infatuated
as to wi&s;h to exchange it for that new
form of things which has produced &s;uch
fatal effects on a neighbouring land? Were
it ever to be introduced among us, it is
not the return of antient &s;uper&s;tition, it is
not the bondage of the church of Rome
we would have to dread; evils great in
them&s;elves, but &s;mall in compari&s;on of what
&s;uch a revolution would produce. As &s;oon
as under the gui&s;e of philo&s;ophy, and with
the pretence of unlimited toleration, the
e&s;tabli&s;hed forms of religion were demo|li&s;hed
in France, the flood-gates were
opened to pour a torrent of avowed in|fidelity,
<PB N="135" REF="146">
athei&s;m, and all the gro&s;&s;e&s;t im|moralities,
over that devoted country. We
have beheld the throne and the altar over|thrown
together; and nothing but a
wretched ruin le&s;t, where once a &s;tately
&s;abric &s;tood. We have &s;een the venerable
$word$ of $$ngion, &s;tripped of their &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence,
torn from their churches, driven
from their homes, and forced to wander
as exiles, and beg their bread in a foreign
land.&mdash;We have &s;een the la&s;t con&s;olation
of the wretched de&s;troyed, and the grave
&s;ealed again&s;t their hope, by the public de|claration
that death is an eternal &s;leep.&mdash;Such
have been the ble&s;&s;ed fruits of that new
order of things which boa&s;ted of being to
re&s;tore happine&s;s to all the nations. Such
are the con&s;equences we have to expect
among our&s;elves, if ever the like dangerous
opinions &s;hall prevail in Britain.&mdash;With
horror let us turn away from the thought.
With earne&s;tne&s;s let us <HI>pray for the peace
of our Jeru&s;alem; and for the hou&s;e of the
Lord our God, let us zealou&s;ly &s;eek its good.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="147">
III. WE love our country as the &s;eat of
liberty and laws; a mild, wi&s;e, and happy
government. This opens a much wider
field of di&s;cour&s;e than the bounds of a
&s;ermon admit. But on this part of the
&s;ubject being happily anticipated by &s;o
many excellent publications which have
lately appeared, I &s;hall content my&s;elf with
making a few leading ob&s;ervations.&mdash;The
ends for which men unite in &s;ociety and
&s;ubmit to government are, to enjoy &s;ecurity
to their property, and freedom to their
per&s;ons from all inju&s;tice or violence. The
more completely tho&s;e ends are obtained,
with the lea&s;t diminution of per&s;onal li|berty,
the nearer &s;uch government ap|proaches
to perfection: I &s;ay, approaches
to it; for a perfect government is a mere
chimera. Before we can expect it to take
place, we mu&s;t wait till we &s;ee any one
thing whatever arrive at perfection on
earth. The two extremes to be guarded
again&s;t are, de&s;poti&s;m, where all are &s;laves;
and anarchy, where all would rule, and
none obey.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="148">
The Briti&s;h government may appear at
different periods to have inclined &s;ometimes
to the one, and &s;ometimes to the other of
tho&s;e extremes. In its pre&s;ent &s;tate, it may
ju&s;tly be accounted to be removed to an
equal di&s;tance from either of tho&s;e evils;
and therefore to have approached nearer
to the perfection of &s;ocial order, than any
other government, antient or modern. To
this point it has arrived in the progre&s;s of
ages, not in con&s;equence of theories formed
by &s;peculative men, &s;uch as our modern
reformers, but in con&s;equence of experi|ments
made, and trials undergone. Expe|rience,
that great parent of all, but e&s;pe|cially
of political, wi&s;dom, taught a brave,
generous, and high-&s;pirited people, how to
correct, by degrees, preceding evils, and
to form the wi&s;e&s;t plan for liberty and &s;e|curity.
In this &s;tate we now find the
Briti&s;h con&s;titution. It &s;tands among the
nations of the earth, like an antient oak in
the wood, which, after having overcome
many a bla&s;t, overtops the other trees of
the fore&s;t, and commands re&s;pect and vene|ration.
<PB N="138" REF="149">
All foreigners look to it with
wonder, and with envy, as the happie&s;t
&s;y&s;tem that ever was devi&s;ed for uniting
dignity in the magi&s;trate and liberty in the
&s;ubject, with protection and &s;ecurity to all.
Ju&s;tly may we challenge tho&s;e who attempt
to critici&s;e it, to produce, from the annals
of hi&s;tory, any example of &s;uch a multitude
of men as the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, held together
in the bonds of civil &s;ociety, under &s;o few
re&s;traints, and with &s;uch full enjoyment of
freedom as we po&s;&s;e&s;s: ble&s;&s;ed too for a
whole century pa&s;t with a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
princes, who made the laws of the land the
rule of their government; ble&s;&s;ed now with
a Sovereign at the head of the empire, to
whom faction it&s;elf cannot impute, through|out
his long reign, any acts of tyranny,
cruelty, or oppre&s;&s;ion; who&s;e per&s;onal vir|tues
and who&s;e dome&s;tic conduct hold forth
to the nation &s;uch a high example of piety,
decency, and good order, as, if generally fol|lowed,
would render all his &s;ubjects happy.</P>
<P>In oppo&s;ition to &s;uch &s;entiments as I
have now delivered in favour of the con|&s;titution
<PB N="139" REF="150">
of our country, we are called
upon, by a certain &s;et of men, to look to a
republic as the glory of all governments.
There, we are told, every man comes forth
to act his part with vigour; and by the
exertion of his talents, has opportunities of
ri&s;ing to the highe&s;t di&s;tinction and power.
&mdash;In reply to this, let it be ob&s;erved, fir&s;t,
that there are no advantages claimed by a
republic, but what under the Briti&s;h con|&s;titution
are enjoyed to the full. On the
exertion of any laudable and honourable
talent whatever, no re&s;traint is laid; no
odious di&s;tinctions take place between the
nobility and the people; no &s;evere ex|clu&s;ive
privileges are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the former
to the prejudice of the latter; but merit
in every rank has the free&s;t &s;cope, and
examples abound of per&s;ons ri&s;ing by their
talents from ordinary rank and humble
birth to high di&s;tinction in the &s;tate.</P>
<P>But next, it may be boldly a&s;&s;erted, that
of all the forms of government which have
been e&s;tabli&s;hed on the earth, the republican
is attended with the greate&s;t di&s;advantages
<PB N="140" REF="151">
to tho&s;e who live under it. In a &s;mall
&s;tate, where the people re&s;emble the in|habitants
of one family, the management
of their concerns can more &s;afely be carried
on by their own joint coun&s;els, without
any &s;upreme magi&s;trate. But if govern|ment
be extended over a large territory,
and over numerous inhabitants of different
orders and fortunes, it has ever been found
impo&s;&s;ible to pre&s;erve any well-regulated
balance of power under a republican con|&s;titution.
It has ever been, and never
can be, any other, than a perpetual con|te&s;t
between oligarchy and democracy;
between the rich and the poor; between
a few popular leaders who a&s;pire to the
chief influence, and the unruly violence of
a turbulent multitude. In &s;uch $$ates an
internal warfare of this kind has been al|mo&s;t
always carried on, with &s;uch vio|lent
convul&s;ions and party animo&s;$ties, as
have given ri&s;e to more mi&s;eries than have
been &s;uffered under any other form of go|vernment
whatever.&mdash;To no purpo&s;e are
quoted to us the heroes of Greece and
<PB N="141" REF="152">
Rome. Amid&s;t the agitations of popular
government, occa&s;ions will &s;ometimes be
afforded for eminent abilities to break forth
with peculiar lu&s;tre. But while public agi|tations
allow a few individuals to be un|commonly
di&s;tingui&s;hed, the general con|dition
of the people remains calamitous
and wretched. Under de&s;potic govern|ments,
mi&s;erable indeed is the condition of
tho&s;e who are near the throne. But while
they are often the &s;port, and the victims
of capricious cruelty, the ordinary ma&s;s of
the people, at a di&s;tance from the thunder
of power, are l$$t, for the mo&s;t part, in
their inferiour &s;ituations, unmole&s;ted.
Whereas, under a multitude of popular
governours, oppre&s;&s;ion is more exten&s;ively
felt. It pen$$rates into the interiour of
families; and by republican tyranny the
humble and ob&s;cure are liable to be as
much hara&s;&s;ed and vexed as the great and
the wealthy.</P>
<P>If any one doubt of tho&s;e facts, let him
look at the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the republic
e&s;tabli&s;hed in that country to which we
<PB N="142" REF="153">
have &s;o often been unfortunately obliged to
allude. He will there behold a memorable
example &s;et forth to the world; but an
example, not for imitation, but for in&s;truc|tion
and caution; an example, not of ex|ploits
to be copied, or of advantages to be
gained, but of all the evils again&s;t which men,
joined in &s;ociety, ought to &s;tand on their
guard. He will behold the republican
halls hung round with monuments of pro|&s;criptions,
ma&s;&s;acres, impri&s;onments, requi|&s;itions,
domiciliary &s;earches, and &s;uch other
trophies of the glorious victory of repub|licani&s;m
over monarchical power. <HI>O my
&s;oul, come not thou into their &s;ecret; into their
a&s;&s;embly, mine honour, be not thou united;
for their anger was fierce, and their wrath
was cruel</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Gene&s;is, xlix. 6, 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ENOUGH has now been &s;aid to convince
every rea&s;onable &s;ubject of the Briti&s;h go|vernment,
that he has good grounds for
loving and re&s;pecting his country. It re|mains
<PB N="143" REF="154">
to point out the duties to which the
love of our country gives ri&s;e. Though
the&s;e branch out into many particulars,
they may be compri&s;ed under two general
heads; the duties which are required of us
in our character as private men, and tho&s;e
which belong to us in a political capacity
as &s;ubjects and citizens.</P>
<P>FIRST, as private men and Chri&s;tians,
let us cultivate tho&s;e virtues which are e&s;|&s;ential
to the pro&s;perity of our country.
The foundation of all public happine&s;s
mu&s;t be laid in the good conduct of indi|viduals;
in their indu&s;try, &s;obriety, ju&s;tice,
and regular attention to the duties of their
&s;everal &s;tations. Such virtues are the
&s;inews and &s;trength of the &s;tate; they are
the &s;upports of its pro&s;perity at home, and
of its reputation abroad; while luxury,
corruption, venality, and idlene&s;s, unnerve
the public vigour, di&s;grace the public cha|racter,
and pave the way to general ruin.
Every vice, however fa&s;hionable, that be|comes
prevalent, is the infu&s;ion of &s;o much
<PB N="144" REF="155">
poi&s;on into the public cup; and in propor|tion
to the degree of its prevalence, will the
health and &s;trength of the nation be impaired.
Few of us by our arms, and fewer &s;till by our
coun&s;els, can have influence in promoting
that welfare of our country which all pro|fe&s;s
to de&s;ire. But there is one &s;phere in
which all of us can act as benefactors to
it; by &s;etting a good example, each in his
own line, and performing a worthy and
honourable part. <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> will <HI>ever
exalt a nation;</HI> and <HI>wickedne&s;s</HI> will be, fir&s;t,
the reproach, and then the <HI>ruin of every
people.</HI></P>
<P>Among tho&s;e virtues to which the love
of our country calls us, let us not forget
piety to God. Without a proper &s;en&s;e of
religion, and a due acknowledgment of that
&s;upreme Power which rules among the
kingdoms, no nation was ever found to
pro&s;per long. Let tho&s;e &s;ophi&s;tical rea|&s;oners,
who would teach us that philo&s;ophy
ought now to &s;uper&s;ede the antient preju|dices
of Religion, look to the hi&s;tory of
tho&s;e republics which they &s;o highly
<PB N="145" REF="156">
admire, e&s;pecially to the hi&s;tory of the
Romans. They will there find, that,
during the free&s;t and mo&s;t flouri&s;hing
periods of the republic, the Romans were
the mo&s;t religious of all nations. The
Senate at no time a&s;&s;embled, no Con&s;ul
entered on his office, no great public mea|&s;ure
was ever undertaken, without previous
religious &s;ervices, without prayers and &s;a|crifice.
After every victory, &s;olemn thank&s;|givings
were offered to the gods; and upon
any defeat that was &s;u&s;tained, public hu|miliations
and proce&s;&s;ions were decreed, in
order to deprecate the di&s;plea&s;ure of
Heaven. That much &s;uper&s;tition and
folly entered into what they called reli|gion,
will be readily admitted; but &s;till it
implied reverence to a &s;upreme Power in
Heaven, which ruled all the affairs of men,
and was entitled to their homage. Hence
that &s;acred re&s;pect to an oath, as an in|violable
obligation, which long di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
the Romans; and hi&s;torians have
remarked, that when the reverence for an
oath began to be dimini&s;hed, and the loo&s;e
<PB N="146" REF="157">
epicurean &s;y&s;tem which di&s;carded the belief
of Providence to be introduced, the Ro|man
honour and pro&s;perity from that
period began to decline.&mdash;The&s;e are
things that belong to our admonition, on
whom <HI>the ends of the world are come.</HI></P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place, as we would &s;how
our love to our country, let us join to the
virtues of private men, tho&s;e which belong
to us in a political capacity as &s;ubjects and
citizens. The&s;e mu&s;t appear in loyalty to
our &s;overeign, in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the autho|rity
of rulers and magi&s;trates, and in rea|dine&s;s
to &s;upport the mea&s;ures that are
taken for public welfare and defence.
Without regard to &s;uch duties as the&s;e, it is
evident, not only that the &s;tate cannot
flouri&s;h, but even that it cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t.
Accordingly they are &s;trongly bound upon
us by the authority of &s;cripture. Let every
&s;ou! be &s;ubject to the higher powers; who|&s;oever
re&s;i&s;teth the power, re&s;i&s;teth the ordi|nance
of God. For rulers are not a terror
to good works, but to the evil. Wherefore
<PB N="147" REF="158">
ye mu&s;t needs be &s;ubject, not only for wrath,
but al&s;o for con&s;cience &s;ake<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii. 1&mdash;6.</NOTE>. Such pa&s;&s;ages
as the&s;e, there is little danger of our mi&s;un|der&s;tanding
at pre&s;ent, as if they enjoined
a &s;lavi&s;h &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to authority in things
unlawful. This is by no means the ex|treme
to which the &s;pirit of the times
points, or to which the nature of our civil
con&s;titution leads. The full opportunity
that is given for the voice of the people
being at all times heard, the freedom of
di&s;cu&s;&s;ion on all political matters that is al|lowed
both in di&s;cour&s;e and writing, is a
&s;ufficient guard again&s;t all approaches to
unwarrantable &s;tretches of power in the
ruler, and to unlimited &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion in the
&s;ubject.</P>
<P>But while we duly value this high ad|vantage
of the liberty of the pre&s;s and the
freedom of political di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and when
we behold it perpetually acting as a cen|&s;orial
check on all who are in power, let us
beware, le&s;t, abu&s;ing our liberty, we &s;uffer it
<PB N="148" REF="159">
to degenerate into licentiou&s;ne&s;s. The
multitude, we well know, are always prone
to find fault with tho&s;e who are &s;et over
them, and to arraign their conduct; and
too often this &s;pirit appears when public
dangers ought to &s;ilence the voice of di&s;|content,
and to unite every heart and hand
in the common cau&s;e.&mdash;The management
of a great empire, e&s;pccially in difficult
times, is the conduct of an unwieldy and
intricate machine, in directing the move|ments
of which, where is the hand &s;o &s;teady
as never to err? In&s;tead of the violent cen|&s;ures
which the giddy and pre&s;umptuous
are &s;o ready to pour forth, moderation in
di&s;cu&s;&s;ing matters of which they are very
incompetent judges, would be much more
wi&s;e and becoming. The art of govern|ment
and legi&s;lation is undoubtedly the
mo&s;t nice and difficult of all the arts in
which the human mind can be engaged;
and where the greate&s;t preparation of know|ledge,
experience, and ability are ab&s;o|lutely
requi&s;ite to qualify men for the ta&s;k.
But in times when legi&s;lation is con&s;idered
<PB N="149" REF="160">
as a trade which every man is qualified to
take up; when the manufacturer quits his
loom, and the arti&s;an lays down his tools,
in order to contrive plans for reforming
the &s;tate, and to con&s;titute &s;ocieties for car|rying
his plans into execution; what can
be expected to follow from &s;uch a &s;pirit, if
it were to become prevalent, but the mo&s;t
direful confu&s;ion?&mdash;Were the ra&s;hne&s;s of
&s;ome, who&s;e intentions are innocent, the
only evil to be dreaded, the danger would
be le&s;s. But it is always to be apprehended
that the operations of &s;uch per&s;ons are di|rected
by men who have deeper de&s;igns in
view; who &s;eek to embroil the &s;tate in
order to bring forward them&s;elves; who&s;e
aim it is to ri&s;e into eminence, though it
were on the ruins of public tranquillity and
order. Let &s;uch men, if any &s;uch there
be, con&s;ider well what the con&s;equences
may be of fomenting the &s;pirit of pre&s;ump|tuous
innovation. It is a dangerous wea|pon
which they attempt to wield. By the
agitation which they rai&s;e among a blind
multitude, they are giving impul&s;e to the
<PB N="150" REF="161">
motions of a violent engine, which often
di&s;charges its explo&s;ions on the heads of
tho&s;e who fir&s;t touched its &s;prings.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, let us, my brethren, be
thankful that our grounds of di&s;content, whe|ther
founded on real or imaginary grievances,
are &s;o few; and that for &s;o great a number
of public ble&s;&s;ings, we have rea&s;on to ble&s;s
the God of Heaven. We live in a land
of pure religion, of liberty, and laws, and
under a ju&s;t and mild government. How|ever
the opinions of men may differ about
this or that political mea&s;ure adopted by
government, it may with confidence be
&s;aid, that we have much rea&s;on to re&s;pect
tho&s;e rulers, under who&s;e admini&s;tration
the empire, though engaged in a hazardous
and expen&s;ive war, has all along continued
to hold a high rank among the nations of
Europe, and has attained to that flou|ri&s;hing
&s;tate of commerce, opulence, and
&s;afety, in which we behold it at this day:
in&s;omuch that perhaps the greate&s;t dangers
we have to apprehend, ari&s;e from the jea|lou&s;y
<PB N="151" REF="162">
with which rival nations behold our
&s;uperiority at &s;ea, and our wealth and
&s;trength at home.&mdash;Let our prayers a&s;cend
frequently to Heaven for the continuance

<Q>Say now unto her, &startq;Behold thou ha&s;t been
careful for us with all this care; what
is to be done for thee? Would&s;t thou be
&s;poken for to the King, or to the Captain

<P>A PIOUS and re&s;pectable woman of
Shunem had exerci&s;ed great ho&s;pita|lity
to the prophet Eli&s;ha.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. VII.</NOTE> In order to ac|commodate
him in his various journeyings,
&s;he had cau&s;ed a chamber to be built for
him, adjacent to her hou&s;e, where he might
<PB N="153" REF="164">
be furni&s;hed with all that, according to the
&s;implicity of tho&s;e times, was wanted for
his entertainment. In the text, the pro|phet,
by his &s;ervant Gehazi, acknowledges
the obligations he lay under to this good
woman for her care and attention; and
being at that time in favour with the king of
I&s;rael, de&s;ires to know, whether, in return
for her kindne&s;s, he &s;hould apply to the
king, or the captain of the ho&s;t, in her be|half,
and procure advancement to her in
rank and fortune. Her an&s;wer be&s;peaks all
the mode&s;ty of one who was &s;atisfied and
contented with her pre&s;ent lot. Without
any affectation of uncommon virtue, or
any haughty contempt of the prophet's
offers, &s;he mildly replies, &startq;<HI>I dwell among
mine own people.</HI>&endq; &startq;I dwell in the con|dition
to which I was born; in my native
land; among my original connections,
and per&s;ons of my own rank; and living
there in peace, I have no de&s;ires of a&s;pir|ing
to a higher rank.&endq;</P>
<P>The temper of this worthy Shunamite,
who could &s;o properly &s;et bounds to her de|&s;ires,
<PB N="154" REF="165">
and enjoy her pre&s;ent condition with
contentment, is what I now propo&s;e to your
imitation. It &s;tands in oppo&s;ition to that
re&s;tle&s;s and di&s;contented &s;pirit which &s;o
often &s;ets men at variance with their
condition in the world, makes them
look with contempt on that &s;tate of life
and &s;phere of action which Providence
has allotted them; and encouraging every
real or &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;couragement to prey
upon their minds, makes them pine for
&s;ome change of fortune.</P>
<P>It is proper, however, to ob&s;erve, that
this moderation of &s;pirit which I am now
recommending, is not incon&s;i&s;tent with our
having a &s;en&s;e of what is unea&s;y or di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing
in our lot, and endeavouring, by
fair means, to render our condition more
agreeable. Entire apathy, or pa&s;&s;ive indif|ference
to all the circum&s;tances of our
external &s;tate, is required by no precept
of religion. What a virtuous degree of
contentment requires and &s;uppo&s;es, is, that
with a mind free from repining anxiety,
we make the be&s;t of our condition whatever
<PB N="155" REF="166">
it is; enjoying &s;uch good things as God
is plea&s;ed to be&s;tow upon us, with a thank|ful
and cheerful heart; without envy at
tho&s;e who appear more pro&s;perous than us;
without any attempt to alter our condition
by unfair means; and without any mur|muring
again&s;t the Providence of Heaven.
&mdash;&startq;In that &s;tate in which it plea&s;ed God
to place me at my birth, I am ready to
remain, as long as it &s;hall be his plea&s;ure
to continue me there. He has placed me
among my equals. Such comforts as he
&s;aw meet for me to po&s;&s;e&s;s, he has be|&s;towed.
The&s;e I &s;hall &s;tudy to improve;
and by his kind Providence favouring
my indu&s;try and application, I may hope
they will be increa&s;ed. In the mean time,
I re&s;t &s;atisfied; and complain not. <HI>I
dwell among mine own people.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>But if this acquie&s;cence in our condition
is to be con&s;idered as belonging to that
contentment which religion requires, what
becomes, it will be &s;aid, of that laudable
ambition, which has prompted many boldly
to a&s;pire with honour and &s;ucce&s;s far be|yond
<PB N="156" REF="167">
their original &s;tate of life?&mdash;I readily
admit, that on &s;ome among the &s;ons of men,
&s;uch high talents are be&s;towed, as mark
them out by the hand of God for &s;uperiour
elevation; by ri&s;ing to which, many, both
in antient and modern times, have had the
opportunity of di&s;tingui&s;hing them&s;elves as
benefactors to their country and to man|kind.
But the&s;e are only a few &s;cattered
&s;tars that &s;hine in a wide hemi&s;phere; &s;uch
rare examples afford no model for general
conduct.&mdash;It is not to per&s;ons of this de&s;crip|tion,
that I now &s;peak. I addre&s;s my&s;elf
to the multitude; to the great body of men
in all the various walks of ordinary life.
Them I warn of the danger of being mi&s;led,
by vanity and &s;elf-conceit, to think them|&s;elves
de&s;erving of a much higher &s;tation
than they po&s;&s;e&s;s. I warn them, not to
nouri&s;h a&s;piring de&s;ires for objects beyond
their power of attaining, or capacity of
enjoying; and thereby to render them&s;elves
unhappy in their pre&s;ent condition, and
di&s;&s;atisfied with all that belongs to it.&mdash;By
this re&s;tle&s;s di&s;contented temper, I &s;hall pro|ceed
<PB N="157" REF="168">
to &s;how that they incur much guilt,
and involve them&s;elves in great folly and
mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>FIRST, di&s;content carries in its nature
much guilt and &s;in. With this con&s;idera|tion
I begin, becau&s;e I am afraid that di&s;|contentment
is commonly treated, in a reli|gious
view, more &s;lightly than it de&s;erves.
A contented temper, we are apt to &s;ay, is a
great happine&s;s to tho&s;e who have it; and
a di&s;contented one, we call an unlucky turn
of mind; as if we were &s;peaking of a
good or bad con&s;titution of body, of &s;ome|thing
that depended not at all on our&s;elves,
but was merely the gift of Nature.&mdash;
Ought this to be the &s;entiment, either of a
rea&s;onable man, or a Chri&s;tian; of one who
knows him&s;elf to be endowed with powers
for governing his own &s;pirit, or who believes
in God and in a world to come? What, I
be&s;e$ch you, do all the ri&s;ings of di&s;content
within you import, but &s;o much concealed
rebellion again&s;t the government of that
&s;upreme Being, who hath appointed your
<PB N="158" REF="169">
place in the world? When you repine at
your &s;tate, as below what you de&s;erved, do
you not inwardly tax Him with inju&s;tice
and partiality, for conferring his favours on
others more unworthy of them, and leav|ing
you neglected and humbled? By treat|ing
with contempt the ble&s;&s;ings he allows
to your &s;tate, do you not, in effect, tell him
that his ble&s;&s;ings are not worthy of being
enjoyed, and merit no thanks, becau&s;e he
does not give you more?&mdash;The outward
expre&s;&s;ions of &s;uch &s;entiments, you may
&s;uppre&s;s. You may affect to appear reli|gious,
by &s;hows of reverence and homage;
but &s;uch appearances deceive not God.
Every habitually di&s;contented per&s;on is, and
mu&s;t be, ill affected towards Him: nay,
though he would wi&s;h to conceal it from
him&s;elf, he is a &s;ecret bla&s;phemer of the
Almighty.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides impiety, di&s;content carries along
with it, as its in&s;eparable concomitants,
&s;everal other &s;inful pa&s;&s;ions. It implies
pride; or an unrea&s;onable e&s;timation of
our own merit, in compari&s;on with others.
<PB N="159" REF="170">
It implies covetou&s;ne&s;s, or an inordinate
de&s;ire for the advantages of external for|tune,
as the only real goods. It implies,
and always engenders, envy, or ill nature,
and hatred towards all whom we &s;ee ri&s;ing
above us in the world. Dare we treat that
as a &s;light infirmity, or a con&s;titutional
weakne&s;s merely, which imports &s;ome of
the wor&s;t di&s;po&s;itions and pa&s;&s;ions of the
human heart?&mdash;The di&s;contented man
is never found without a great &s;hare of
malignity. His &s;pleen irritates and &s;ours
his temper, and leads him to di&s;charge its
venom on all with whom he &s;tands con|nected.
He can act his part well, in no
relation of life. In public affairs, and in
private bu&s;ine&s;s, he is always given to fret|fulne&s;s
and complaint. While the man of
contented mind, ea&s;y and happy in him&s;elf,
is di&s;po&s;ed for living well with others, and
&s;preads around him that cheerfulne&s;s which
he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es; the re&s;tle&s;s di&s;contented per&s;on
is always a troubler of the world; neither
a good friend, nor a good neighbour, nor
a good &s;ubject or citizen.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="171">
IN the &s;econd place, as this di&s;po&s;ition
infers much &s;in, &s;o it argues great folly, and
involves men in many mi&s;eries. If there
be any fir&s;t principle of wi&s;dom, it is un|doubtedly
this: the di&s;tre&s;&s;es that are re|moveable,
endeavour to remove; tho&s;e
which cannot be removed, bear with as
little di&s;quiet as you can: in every &s;ituation
of life there are comforts; find them out
and enjoy them. But this maxim, in all
its parts, is di&s;regarded by the man of di&s;|content.
He is employed in aggravating
his own evils; while he neglects all his
own comforts.&mdash;What is it to you, though
others are &s;uppo&s;ed to be happier? Very
po&s;&s;ibly they are not &s;o; for wide is the
difference between being what the world
calls pro&s;perous, and being happy. You
&s;ee no more than the impo&s;ing out&s;ide of
glittering fortune; while, under that gaudy
cover, there may be lurking many a bitter
&s;orrow.&mdash;But &s;uppo&s;ing others to be in
truth as happy as they &s;eem to be, is there
any rea&s;on, except mere viciou&s;ne&s;s of di&s;|po&s;ition,
why their happine&s;s &s;hould be a
<PB N="161" REF="172">
cau&s;e of your di&s;content and mi&s;ery? Cannot
you be at your ea&s;e in the &s;hade, becau&s;e
others are ba&s;king in the &s;un? What is this
but the unhappy art of extracting from
objects that ought to be indifferent to you,
materials for your own torment?</P>
<P>&startq;Such rea&s;onings as the&s;e,&endq; &s;ays one,
may be &s;pecious and plau&s;ible; but what
avail rea&s;onings to &s;et me at ea&s;e, who
every day feel my&s;elf hurt and &s;ore from
the &s;corn of tho&s;e above me; who am
condemned to behold them &s;hining in all
the pomp and &s;plendour of life; while I,
through the inju&s;tice of the world, am
left in ob&s;curity of toil for a &s;eanty &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence?&endq;
&mdash;Accu&s;e not the world, my
brother. Imagine not, that it is entirely
the inju&s;tice of the world which produces
your unhappine&s;s. The di&s;ca&s;e lies within
your&s;elf. It originates from your pride
and &s;elf-conceit, joined with the fal&s;e opi|nions
you have allowed your&s;elf to enter|tain
of the di&s;tinctions of fortune. Tho&s;e
di&s;tinctions mu&s;t take place in every e&s;tab|li&s;hed
&s;ociety. There mu&s;t be inequality
<PB N="162" REF="173">
of ranks; and of cour&s;e a diver&s;ity of
outward appearance among men. But it
is in the outward appearance that the diver|&s;ity
lies, far more than in what is intrin&s;ic
to happine&s;s and well-being.&mdash;You <HI>dwell
among your own people.</HI> In that rank where
Providence had placed you, you are living
among your friends and equals; and pur|&s;uing
that train of life to which you have
been bred. But you are eager and re&s;tle&s;s,
till from this quiety ob&s;curity you can ri&s;e
to &s;ome higher elevation, to which you
fancy your&s;elf entitled.&mdash;Are you aware of
the dangers and troubles that would await
you there? Suppo&s;ing you to be in &s;ome
degree &s;ucce&s;sful, yet, with your new rank
of life would not new burdens begin to
oppre&s;s you, and new and unknown cares
to vex you? How many rivals would you
have to encounter? how many &s;landerers to
decry you? how many enemies to combine
in oppo&s;ing you? What mortification would
you endure on every di&s;appointment you
met with? and on every &s;mall &s;tep of ad|vancement,
what envy would &s;till remain
<PB N="163" REF="174">
in looking up to tho&s;e who continued above
you? till at la&s;t, tired with the vexations of
competition, you &s;hould be forced to regret
the day when di&s;content drove you away
from <HI>dwelling among your own people.</HI>&mdash;
Awake then, in time, from the dreams of
ambition and vanity. In&s;tead of a&s;piring
beyond your proper level, bring down your
mind to your &s;tate; le&s;t, by aiming too
high, you &s;pend your life in a train of
fruitle&s;s pur&s;uits, and bring your&s;elf at la&s;t
to a &s;tate of entire in&s;ignificance and con|tempt.</P>
<P>Let it be farther con&s;idered, in order to
&s;how the folly of a di&s;contented temper,
that the more it is indulged, it di&s;qualifies
you the more from being freed from the
grounds of your di&s;content. Fir&s;t, you
have rea&s;on to apprehend that it will turn
the di&s;plea&s;ure of God again&s;t you, and
make him your enemy. For what have
you to expect from that Providence towards
which you are &s;o &s;ullen and unthankful;
from that God, who&s;e perfections you in|jure
by your repining and accu&s;ing
<PB N="164" REF="175">
thoughts? How much is it in his power to
render you ten times more unhappy than
you are at pre&s;ent, by taking away tho&s;e
remaining comforts, which, by your con|tempt
of them, you &s;how your&s;elf unworthy
to enjoy?&mdash;Next, by your &s;pleen and
di&s;content, you are certain of bringing your|&s;elf
into variance with the world as well as
with God. Such a temper is likely to
create enemies; it can procure you no
friends. Proud, jealous, and di&s;&s;atisfied
with tho&s;e around you, you will, in return,
be avoided, di&s;liked, and looked upon by
them with an evil eye; the di&s;couragements
from the world, of which you complain,
will daily increa&s;e; while the humble, the
cheerful, and contented, will, on every oc|ca&s;ion,
get before you, and attract the good|will
of all who can a&s;&s;i&s;t them.</P>
<P>SUCH being the mi&s;chiefs, &s;uch the guilt
and the folly of indulging a di&s;contented
&s;pirit, I &s;hall now &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome con&s;idera|tions
which may a&s;&s;i&s;t us in checking it, and
in reconciling our minds to the &s;tate in
<PB N="165" REF="176">
which it has plea&s;ed Providence to place us.
Let us, for this purpo&s;e, attend to three great
objects; to God, to our&s;elves, and to the
world around us.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Let us &s;peak of God, of his per|fections,
and government of the world;
from which, to every per&s;on of reflection
who believes in God at all, there cannot
but ari&s;e &s;ome cure to the di&s;contents and
griefs of the heart. For had it been left to
our&s;elves what to devi&s;e or wi&s;h, in order
to &s;ecure peace to us in every &s;tate, what
could we have invented &s;o effectual as the
a&s;&s;urance of being under the government of
an Almighty Ruler, who&s;e conduct to his
creatures can have no other object but their
good and welfare?&mdash;Above all, and inde|pendent
of all, He can have no temptation
to inju&s;tice or partiality. Neither jealou&s;y
nor envy can dwell with the Supreme
Being. He is a rival to none, he is an
enemy to none, except to &s;uch as, by re|bellion
again&s;t his laws, &s;eek enmity with
him. He is equally above envying the
<PB N="166" REF="177">
greate&s;t, or de&s;pi&s;ing the meane&s;t, of his
&s;ubjects.&mdash;His di&s;pen&s;ations, it is true, are
often dark and unaccountable to us; but
we know the rea&s;on of this to be, that we
&s;ee only a part of them, and are not yet
able to comprehend the whole. This we well
know, that we our&s;elves are often the very
wor&s;t judges of what is good or ill for us
in this life. We gra&s;p at the pre&s;ent, with|out
due regard to con&s;equence$; and whe|ther
the&s;e con&s;equences are to carry the
advantages we had promi&s;ed our&s;elves, or
be pregnant with future evils, is what we
cannot fore&s;ee. Experience has taught us
a thou&s;and times, that God judges better
for us, than we judge for our&s;elves. Often
have we &s;een that what we con&s;idered at the
time as a &s;ore di&s;appointment, has proved
in the i&s;&s;ue to be a merciful providence;
and that, if what we once eagerly wi&s;hed
for had been obtained, it would have been
&s;o far from making us happy, that it would
have produced our r$in.&mdash;The reflexion
of Solomon. <HI>who know$th what is good for
man in this life, all the days of his vain life,
<PB N="167" REF="178">
which he &s;pendeth as a &s;hadow</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. vi. 12.</NOTE>? &s;hould often
occur to every one who is given to di&s;con|tent.
Placed as we are, in the mid&s;t of &s;o
much ignorance with re&s;pect to the means
of happine&s;s, and at the &s;ame time under
the government of a wi&s;e and gracious$
Being, who alone is able to effect our hap|pine&s;s,
acquie&s;cence in his di&s;po&s;al of our
lot, is the only di&s;po&s;ition that becomes us
as rational creatures. To fret and repine
at every di&s;appointment of our wi&s;hes, is
to di&s;cover the temper of froward children,
not of men, far le&s;s of chri&s;tians. Chri&s;|tians,
amid&s;t all their grievances, have ever
the&s;e promi&s;es to comfort them; that if they
<HI>ca&s;t their care$ upon God, he will care for them;</HI>
that out of evil, he bringeth forth good;
nay, that at la&s;t <HI>he &s;hall make all things
work together for good to them who love
him.</HI></P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place, in order to correct
di&s;content, let us attend to our&s;elves and our
<PB N="168" REF="179">
own &s;tate. Let us con&s;ider two things
there; how little we de&s;erve, and how much
we enjoy. As to de&s;erving, in the &s;ight of
God, the Great Di&s;po&s;er of our lot, we
know that we have no claim. We are all
&s;inners; who are &s;o far from having a title
to challenge favours as our due, that we
mu&s;t acknowledge it to be of God's mercies
that we are not con&s;umed. As to de&s;erving
from the world, we are apt indeed &s;ome|times
to make high and unrea&s;onable pre|ten&s;ions;
yet, &s;urely, very conceited we
mu&s;t be, if we be not di&s;po&s;ed to admit,
that there are many of at lea&s;t equal merit
with us, who&s;e condition in the world is
no better, perhaps much wor&s;e than ours;
who yet make no complaints, who&s;e di&s;|contents
are not heard. How much &s;plen|did
genius is buried in forgotten neglect
and ob&s;curity? How much real worth and
merit is driven forth to &s;uffer all the hard|&s;hips
of a &s;tormy life, while we <HI>dwell among
our own people?</HI>&mdash;Look into your &s;tate,
my brethren, and, before you give vent to
peevi&s;hne&s;s, make a fair and ju&s;t e&s;timate
<PB N="169" REF="180">
of all the ble&s;&s;ings you enjoy, in compari&s;on
with others. You would willingly, I know,
exchange your condition, in part, with
many. You would gladly have the wealth
of this man; you would have the high re|putation
and honour of another; the health
perhaps, and firm vigour of a third. But
I a&s;k, Who is there with whom you would
wi&s;h to make a total exchange? to forego
altogether your pre&s;ent &s;elf; and to be ju&s;t
what he is, in mind, and in body, as well
as in outward e&s;tate? If this be an exchange,
which few, I apprehend, are willing to
make, does not this argue, that each man,
on the whole, is &s;ufficiently plea&s;ed with
him&s;elf; that there are, in every &s;ituation,
certain comforts, and certain grounds of
&s;elf-complacency and &s;atisfaction, which
ought in rea&s;on to be employed as remedies
again&s;t di&s;content?</P>
<P>IN the la&s;t place, con&s;ider the &s;tate of the
world around you.&mdash;You are not happy.
You <HI>dwell,</HI> you admit, <HI>among your own
people.</HI> But there, &s;ay you, &startq;How many
<PB N="170" REF="181">
vexations do I occa&s;ionally experience?
Sometimes di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for want of health;
&s;ometimes di&s;appointed in my plans, and
&s;traitened in my circum&s;tances; at other
times, afflicted with dome&s;tic troubles:
&s;o that I am far from being as I would
wi&s;h to be.&endq;&mdash;Pray, my brother, who
is there that lives in every re&s;pect ju&s;t as he
would wi&s;h to live? Fir&s;t, find out &s;uch
a per&s;on; look through all conditions and
ranks, and try if you can di&s;cover one who
will tell you that he has no complaint or
unea&s;ine&s;s whatever, before you allow your|&s;elf
to repine at your pre&s;ent &s;ituation.
Do you pre&s;ume to indulge di&s;content,
merely becau&s;e you are included in the
common lot; becau&s;e you are not exempted
from bearing your &s;hare of the common
burden? What is human life to all, but a
mixture of &s;ome &s;cattered joys and plea|&s;ures,
with various cares and troubles?</P>
<P>You have, perhaps, &s;et your heart on

<BIBL>PSALM $xxiii. 28.</BIBL>
<Q>It is good for me to draw near to God.&mdash;</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN this p&s;alm the pious author de&s;cribes
him&s;elf as &s;uffering a great conflict within
his mind.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. VIII.</NOTE> His ob&s;ervation of the cour&s;e
of Providence, did not pre&s;ent to him &s;uch
an order of things as was to have been
expected from the ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s of
Heaven. The wicked appeared flouri&s;hing
and triumphant, while the worthy were
de&s;titute and oppre&s;&s;ed; and much di&s;order
<PB N="174" REF="185">
and darkne&s;s &s;eemed to prevail in the cour&s;e
of human affairs. Hence his mind fluctuated
for a while amid&s;t doubts and fears. His
tru&s;t in the divine admini&s;tration was even
&s;o far &s;haken as to create a &s;u&s;picion, that
in <HI>vain he had clean&s;ed his heart, and wa&s;hed
his hands in innocency:</HI> till at la&s;t he <HI>went
into the &s;anctuary of God,</HI> and was there
taught to view the &s;tate of human things
in a ju&s;ter and truer light. He then &s;aw
the vanity of that earthly pro&s;perity which
bad men appear to enjoy; and the happy
i&s;&s;ue of all things at the la&s;t to the pious
and good. He &s;aw the divine pre&s;ence
ever &s;urrounding them, and though with
invi&s;ible guidance, yet with unerring hand,
bringing them, in the end, to glory. His
mind returned to tranquillity; and, &s;truck
with compunction for his pa&s;t errors, he
ro&s;e into tho&s;e high and memorable ex|pre&s;&s;ions
of devotion, which we find in the
ver&s;es preceding the text. <HI>Thou &s;halt guide
me with thy coun&s;el, and afterward receive
me to glory. Whom have I in heaven but
thee? and there is none on earth that I
<PB N="175" REF="186">
de&s;ire be&s;ides thee. My fle&s;h and my heart
faileth; but God is the &s;trength of my heart,
and my portion for ever.</HI> His &s;ixed prin|ciple
and re&s;olution, upon the whole, he
declares in the words of the text, <HI>It is good
for me to draw near to God;</HI> words which
will immediately occur to you as particu|larly
&s;uited to the &s;olemn &s;ervice in which
we are to be engaged this day. In di&s;|cour&s;ing
from them, I &s;hall endeavour to
&s;how what is implied in <HI>drawing near to
God;</HI> and what rea&s;on we have, to agree
with the P&s;almi&s;t in judging this to be <HI>good
for us.</HI></P>
<P>To <HI>draw near to God,</HI> is an expre&s;&s;ion of
awful and my&s;terious import; in explain|ing
which, we have much rea&s;on to be
&s;ober and mode&s;t, and to guard with care
again&s;t every enthu&s;ia&s;tic exce&s;s; remem|bering
always, that ri&s;e as high as we can,
an immea&s;urable and infinite di&s;tance mu&s;t
ever remain between us and the Supreme
Being. There are two &s;en&s;es in which
we may be &s;aid to <HI>draw near,</HI> in &s;uch a de|gree
as mortality admits, <HI>to God:</HI> either by
<PB N="176" REF="187">
the general cour&s;e of a pious and virtuous
life; or in &s;olemn acts of immediate de|votion.</P>
<P>I. By the practice of holine&s;s and virtue
throughout the general tenor of life, we
may be &s;aid to <HI>draw near to God;</HI> for it is
&s;uch an approach as we can make to
the re&s;emblance of his moral perfections.
After the image of God, man was created.
That image was defaced by our &s;in and
apo&s;tacy. By a return to God and our
duty, that image, through the intervention
of our Saviour, is renewed upon the &s;oul;
man is &s;aid to be regenerated or born
again, and is in &s;ome degree re&s;tored to
that connexion with God which ble&s;&s;ed
his primaeval &s;tate. He who lives in the
exerci&s;e of good affections, and in the re|gular
di&s;charge of the offices of virtue and
piety, maintains, as far as his infirmity al|lows,
conformity with the nature of that per|fect
Being, who&s;e benevolence, who&s;e purity
and rectitude, are con&s;picuous, both in his
works and his ways.&mdash;Worldly and corrupt
<PB N="177" REF="188">
men, on the contrary, e&s;trange them&s;elves
from all that is divine. They degrade
their nature by unworthy pur&s;uits, and
are perpetually &s;inking in the &s;cale of being.
By &s;en&s;uality, they de&s;cend to the rank
of the brute creation; by malignity, envy,
and other bad pa&s;&s;ions, they connect them|&s;elves
with devils and infernal &s;pirits.
Hence they are &s;aid in Scripture, to be
<HI>alienated from the life of God;</HI> to be <HI>without
God in the world.</HI> Though in one &s;en&s;e,
God is ever near them, as he &s;urrounds
and encompa&s;&s;es them on all hands; yet,
in a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e, they are farther removed
from him than any di&s;tance of place can
&s;eparate bodies from one another.&mdash;
Whereas a virtuous man, who&s;e plea&s;ure
it is to do good, and his &s;tudy to pre&s;erve
him&s;elf upright and pure, is in the cour&s;e
of con&s;tant approach towards cele&s;tial na|ture.
He is the lover of order, the fol|lower
of that righteou&s;ne&s;s of which God
is the author and in&s;pirer. He accords
with the great laws of the univer&s;e, and
&s;econds the de&s;igns of its Almighty Go|vernour.
<PB N="178" REF="189">
He is, if we may &s;o &s;peak, in
uni&s;on with God. Hence piety and virtue
are de&s;cribed in Scripture as friend&s;hip with
God, as introducing us into his family,
and rendering us <HI>members of his hou&s;ehold.</HI>
Strong expre&s;&s;ions are u&s;ed on this &s;ubject
by the &s;acred writers. A good man is &s;aid
<HI>to dwell in God, and God in him</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">$ John, iii. 24.&mdash;iv. 13.</NOTE>. <HI>If a man
love me,</HI> &s;ays our Lord, <HI>he will keep my
words; and my Father will love him; and
we will come, and make our abode with him</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John, xiv. 23.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The&s;e high and magnificent views of re|ligion,
as an approach to God, may ea&s;ily
&s;atisfy us how much it mu&s;t be <HI>good for us
to draw near to God,</HI> in this &s;en&s;e of the ex|pre&s;&s;ion.
It is vi&s;ibly the honour and dig|nity
of man to re&s;emble his Creator; and
&s;urely his chief happine&s;s will be ever found
to lie, where his highe&s;t dignity and honour
are found. <HI>With God is the fountain of life.</HI>
With him re&s;ide complete beatitude and per|fection;
and from him are derived all the
<PB N="179" REF="190">
portions of happine&s;s and comfort, which are
any where to be found among the creatures
he has made. In exact proportion, there|fore,
as they approach to, or deviate from
him, mu&s;t the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of all
rational creatures be. As light and heat
flow from the &s;un as their centre, &s;o bli&s;s
and joy flow from the Deity; and as with
our di&s;tance from that glorious luminary,
darkne&s;s and cold increa&s;e; &s;o, according as
by alienation of nature we are removed
from God, ruin and mi&s;ery advance in the
&s;ame degree upon the &s;oul.</P>
<P>Now con&s;ider, my brethren, that there is
one or other cour&s;e which you mu&s;t pur&s;ue.
If it be not your &s;tudy to <HI>draw near to God</HI>
by a religious and virtuous life, be a&s;&s;ured
that you are departing from him; for there
is no middle cour&s;e between &s;in and right|eou&s;ne&s;s;
and let every thinking being
&s;eriou&s;ly reflect what is included in this
&s;tate of being far from God, and cut off
from every kindly influence that de&s;cends
from heaven. With &s;hadows of plea&s;ure,
per&s;ons in this unhappy &s;ituation may be
<PB N="180" REF="191">
&s;urrounded and amu&s;ed; but &s;hadows only,
and not realities, they mu&s;t be, as long as
men have no connection with Him who is
the origin of all good. Can the &s;tream
continue to flow when it is cut off from the
fountain? Can the branch flouri&s;h when
torn away from the &s;tock which gave it nou|ri&s;hment?
No more can dependent &s;pirits
be happy, when parted from all union with
the Father of Spirits and the Fountain of
Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>A good man, who is always endeavouring
to draw near to God, lives under the &s;miles
of the Almighty. He knows that he is
under the protection of that God towards
whom he a&s;pires. He can look up to him
with plea&s;ing hope; and tru&s;t that he &s;hall
receive illumination and aid in his progre&s;s
to perfection. His virtues may as yet be
imperfect, and attended with many failings;
but his approach towards God is begun.
The &s;teps by which he draws near to him
may be &s;low; but that progre&s;s is com|menced,
which in a future &s;tate &s;hall be
more &s;ucce&s;sfully carried on, and which
<PB N="181" REF="192">
&s;hall continue to advance through all eter|nity.
<HI>They go on,</HI> &s;ays the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>from
&s;trength to &s;trength; every one of them ap|peareth
before God in Zion.</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;. lxxxiv$ 7.</NOTE>. Hence, by a
very beautiful and in&s;tructive metaphor, the
<HI>path of the ju&s;t,</HI> is de&s;cribed in Scripture to be
<HI>as the &s;hining light, that &s;hineth more and
more unto the perfect day</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. iv. 18.</NOTE>. It is the dawn
of a glorious morning, which increa&s;es by
degrees to meridian &s;plendour; and as the
morning dawn, though dim and feeble, is
neverthele&s;s a ray of the &s;ame light which
forms the brightne&s;s of noon-day, we are
hereby taught to conceive, that the piety and
virtue of good men now, is a degree of ce|le&s;tial
nature already imparted to their &s;ouls,
and differs from its perfection in a higher
world, only as the twilight is inferiour to
noon. The path of the wicked man, is
directly the rever&s;e of all this. Degraded
by his vices, he is con&s;tantly declining more
and more in a downward cour&s;e. His path,
in&s;tead of being as the &s;hining light, is the
<PB N="182" REF="193">
du&s;k of evening begun: that darkne&s;s of the
infer$$l regions to which his nature is tend|ing,
increa&s;es upon him gradually, till the
&s;hadows of night clo&s;e upon his head at la&s;t,
with endle&s;s and impenetrable gloom.&mdash;
Thus fully is verified what the P&s;almi&s;t had
a&s;&s;erted in the ver&s;e preceding the text, <HI>Lo$
they that are far from thee &s;hall peri&s;h;</HI> while
his own fixed &s;entiment he immediately de|clares&mdash;
<HI>but it is good for me to draw near to
God.</HI>&mdash;I proceed</P>
<P>II. To con&s;ider the other &s;en&s;e in which
we may be &s;aid to draw near to God; that
is, in acts of immediate devotion.</P>
<P>There are two ways by which the&s;e con|tribute
to bring us near to God. The fir&s;t
is, by their &s;trengthening in the &s;oul that
power of vital godline&s;s and virtue, in which
con&s;i&s;ts our chief re&s;emblance to God: for
it is never to be forgotten that all our devo|tional
exerci&s;es are &s;ub&s;ervient to this great
end. Herein con&s;i&s;ts their, whole virtue
and efficacy, that they purify and improve
the &s;oul, rai&s;e it above low pa&s;&s;ions, and
<PB N="183" REF="194">
thereby promote the elevation of the human
nature towards the divine. When they are
con&s;idered merely a$ external &s;ervices which
we are obliged to perform, but to which we
addre&s;s our&s;elves with cold and backward
hearts; $word$ when the glow of affection which
they $word$ is merely moment$$y and &s;oon
forgotten, they cannot be held to have any
influence in bringing $word$ near to God. It is
only when they are the &s;ervice of the heart,
when they are the genuine voice of the &s;oul
to God, when they &s;erve to kindle tho&s;e
&s;acred a&s;pirations which continue to breathe
throughout the re&s;t of life, that they a&s;&s;i&s;t
us in u&s;ing towards heaven, and alliance
with God.</P>
<P>When our acts of devotion are of this
nature, they form the other &s;en&s;e in which
the words of the text are to be under&s;tood.
We therein <HI>draw near to God,</HI> as we enter
into the mo&s;t immediate intercour&s;e with
him, which the nature of our &s;tate admits.
In one &s;en&s;e, we cannot be &s;aid to be nearer
to God at any one time than another; as at
all times his pre&s;ence equally &s;urrounds us;
<PB N="184" REF="195">
in the fields, as in the temple; in the mid&s;t
of the world, as much as in the retirement
of the clo&s;et. But when with &s;erious and
devout affections we addre&s;s our&s;elves to
God, in prayer, and prai&s;e, and &s;olemn wor|&s;hip,
we then bring home that divine pre|&s;ence
to our feelings, and formally place
our&s;elves in it. We may then be truly &s;aid
to <HI>draw near to God;</HI> approaching to him
through a great Mediator and Interce&s;&s;or;
&s;ending up tho&s;e prayers to which we are
encouraged to believe that the Almighty is
lending a gracious ear; re&s;igning our&s;elves
to his conduct, and offering up our &s;ouls to
him; exerci&s;ing, in &s;hort, all tho&s;e acts of
faith, love, and tru&s;t, which become de|pendent
creatures towards their Sovereign
and Father.</P>
<P>This intellectual corre&s;pondence of the
heart with our Maker and Redeemer, is
termed, in the language of divines, com|munion
with God. And, if there be truth
in religion at all; if a Supreme Being exi&s;t,
who is in any degree acce&s;&s;ible to his
creatures, and who is gracious to the good,
<PB N="185" REF="196">
it mu&s;t be admitted to have a foundation
in rea&s;on and truth. There mu&s;t be ju&s;t
ground to think, that the wor&s;hip of pure
and holy hearts is acceptable to him; and
the go&s;pel gives us full rea&s;on to believe,
that the energy of his &s;pirit is concerned in
&s;tirring up within them the &s;entiments of
devotion.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time it is incumbent on me
to warn you, that the &s;atisfaction which on
&s;uch occa&s;ions we feel, mu&s;t not be grounded
merely on a belief which we allow our|&s;elves
to entertain, of &s;ome communication
which we had received directly from God.
In the warn, and tran&s;porting moments of
devotion, there is always a hazard of our
mi&s;taking the exalted efforts of our own
imagination, for &s;upernatural impre&s;&s;ions
from Heaven. It is much &s;afer to judge
of the acceptance of our &s;ervices, by an in|ference
which we can warrantably draw
from the &s;tate of our hearts and life, com|pared
to God's written word. <HI>To the law
and the te&s;timony</HI> we mu&s;t always have re|cour&s;e
in judging of our &s;tate; and then
<PB N="186" REF="197">
only the <HI>te&s;timony of God's &s;pirit witne&s;&s;eth
with our &s;pirits</HI> that we are the children of
God, when we can di&s;cern in our&s;elves
tho&s;e declared <HI>fruits of the Spirit,</HI> which are
<HI>love, joy, peace, long-&s;uffering, gentlene&s;s,
goodne&s;s, faith, meekne&s;s, temperance</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Galat. v. 22.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Carrying along with us this caution, it
will be found that, on many accounts, it
will be <HI>good for us, to draw near to God</HI>
in exerci&s;es of &s;olemn devotion.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, it is evidently <HI>good for us,</HI> to di&s;|charge
tho&s;e duties of wor&s;hip, and to give
proof of tho&s;e pious affections, which are
unque&s;tionably due from us to our Heaven|ly
Father. If we be wanting in the&s;e, we
are clearly deficient in one e&s;&s;ential part of
religion. Morality without piety, con&s;ti|tutes
a very imperfect character. It is
neither &s;table in its foundation, nor uni|ver&s;al
in its influence; and gives us no
ground to look for the rewards of tho&s;e,
who&s;e <HI>prayers, together with their alms, come
up in memorial before God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="198">
But, be&s;ides the obligations from duty
which we are laid under to &s;uch religious ex|erci&s;es,
it can clearly be &s;hewn that they are
in them&s;elves good for us, on account of the
improvement, the &s;atisfaction, and comfort,
they enable us to enjoy, in a devout elevation
of the heart towards God and cele&s;tial objects.</P>
<P>When we reflect on the languor that
attends the ordinary circulation of the little
occupations of life; on the in&s;ipidity of
many of its amu&s;ements; and the depre&s;|&s;ion
of &s;pirits that follows after them; we
cannot but be &s;en&s;ible that occa&s;ional inter|cour&s;e
with God and divine things, mu&s;t
furni&s;h a comfortable relief to the mind.
It is not, indeed, an intercour&s;e for which we
are at all times equal; but neither was the
human mind formed to grovel at all times
among low cares and objects. It has a
demand for &s;omething higher and greater,
than what the common round of the world
affords. Hence the extravagant and eccen|tric
pur&s;uits into which we &s;ometimes deviate.
We attempt &s;ome higher bli&s;s, than what we
find here. But the attempt which is made
<PB N="188" REF="199">
by folly, can only be &s;ucce&s;sfully executed by
a wi&s;e and good man, in the elevation of his
&s;oul towards God. Some, indeed, are &s;unk
&s;o low in worldly gratifications, that no|thing
has any reli&s;h with them, but what
either breathes the air of giddy di&s;&s;ipation, or
ta&s;tes of the impure &s;tream of &s;en&s;ual plea|&s;ure.
But this vitiated ta&s;te, contracted
by long corrupt habits, is unnatural in
it&s;elf, and by proper di&s;cipline can be cor|rected
and reformed. Let the mind be
re&s;tored to its &s;ound and natural &s;tate, and
its reli&s;h for what is more great and noble,
will return.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the imperfection and emptine&s;s of
the ordinary plea&s;ures of the world, many
pains and di&s;tre&s;&s;es are always mingled with
them. No more effectual relief from them can
be found, than that which may be enjoyed in
drawing near to God. Pa&s;&s;ions corrode the
mind. Cares and anxieties fe&s;ter in it. We
are fretted by the ingratitude of friends;
&s;oured by the calumnies of enemies;
hara&s;&s;ed with the competition of rivals.
The very bu&s;tle and agitation of the world,
<PB N="189" REF="200">
wear out and oppre&s;s the mind that longs
for tranquillity. In religious retirement,
and in tho&s;e exerci&s;es of devotion that
bring us near to God, we attain a plea&s;ing
region of calm and repo&s;e. There, worldly
pa&s;&s;ions are &s;ilent; worldly cares are hu&s;hed
and forgotten. The mind retires as within
it&s;elf; and remains alone with God. It
is only as afar off that the noi&s;e and di&s;turb|ance
of the world is heard, like the found
of a di&s;tant tumult.</P>
<P>By the perplexity of our worldly concerns,
we may have been involved in trouble. By
the death of our deare&s;t friends, we may
have been overwhelmed with &s;orrow. By
the &s;ituation of public affairs, we may be
alarmed with dangers that threaten our
country. In all &s;uch &s;ituations, is there
any con&s;olation equal to that which the
devout man enjoys in drawing near to
God? He looks up to a Father and a
Friend, in whom he can place his tru&s;t in
every time of need. He hears a voice i&s;&s;uing
from the divine &s;anctuary, which &s;ays,
<HI>Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will

of <HI>drawing near to God,</HI> approaches,
in &s;ome degree, to my&s;tici&s;m and enthu|&s;ia&s;m.
I admit, that if religion were repre|&s;ented
as con&s;i&s;ting wholly of internal devout
emotions, the repre&s;entation of it would be
imperfect and fal&s;e. It is de&s;igned to be
an active principle, regulating the conduct
of life, and exerting it&s;elf in good works. But
very ignorant he mu&s;t be of human nature,
who perceives not, that in order to pro|duce
&s;uch effects, it is of high importance
to engage the affections and the heart on
the &s;ide of virtue. It is not by rea&s;onings
addre&s;&s;ed &s;olely to the under&s;tanding, that
men's characters are formed, or their
general conduct actuated. If you wi&s;h to
work any con&s;iderable effect on their life,
<PB N="193" REF="204">
you mu&s;t bring over the affections and
inclinations to your &s;ide. You mu&s;t not
only &s;hew them what is right and true, but
make them feel what is de&s;irable and good.
If you attempt to make religion &s;o very
calm and rational, as to exclude from it all
warmth of &s;entiment, all affectionate and
devotional feelings, you will leave it in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of &s;mall influence on conduct. <HI>My
&s;on, give me thy heart,</HI> is the voice of God;
and the voice of rea&s;on is, that according
as the heart is affected and di&s;po&s;ed, &s;uch
will be the general character and conduct.</P>
<P>The application of the whole &s;ubject to
the holy &s;acrament which we are now to
celebrate, is natural and obvious. No more
&s;olemn opportunity can be afforded us of
drawing near to God, than what we there
enjoy. All that is encouraging and com|forting
in Chri&s;tian faith is &s;et before us,
in this mo&s;t effectual proof of God's mercy
to mankind, giving up his &s;on to the death
as a &s;acrifice for our &s;ins. In celebrating
the memorial of this great event, we are
<PB N="194" REF="205">
placed as under the immediate brightne&s;s
of heavenly light, and under the warme&s;t
ray of divine love. If there be <HI>any con&s;ola|tion
in Chri&s;t, any fellow&s;hip of the Spirit,</HI>
any plea&s;ing hope of eternal life and joy, it
ought on &s;uch an occa&s;ion to be drawn forth,
and deeply felt. Let us endeavour to kindle,
at the altar of the Lord, that &s;acred fire,
which &s;hall continue to diffu&s;e its vivifying
influence over our hearts, when we go
abroad into the world, and mingle again in
the ordinary concerns of life. We are now
to <HI>draw near to God.</HI> Let us draw near
to him as our Father; but with that reve|rence
and humility which becomes us on
approaching to a Father <HI>who is in Heaven.</HI>
Let us draw near through that great Media|tor,
by who&s;e merits and interce&s;&s;ion alone
our &s;ervices find acceptance at the divine

line of action which is likely to terminate
<PB N="196" REF="207">
according as we wi&s;h; and another which,
for certain, will land us in di&s;appointment.
If, in the ordinary tran&s;actions of life, we
cannot pro&s;per without a due exerci&s;e of
wi&s;dom and prudence, a higher degree of it
is certainly nece&s;&s;ary in tho&s;e momentous
parts of conduct which regard our everla&s;t|ing
welfare.</P>
<P>It is indeed confe&s;&s;ed, that in religious
conduct the fundamental and mo&s;t im|portant
article is &s;incerity of heart, and
goodne&s;s of intention. At the &s;ame time,
let the intentions be ever &s;o pure and &s;in|cere,
they will be in hazard of falling into
&s;ome wrong direction, unle&s;s they be pro|perly
guided by wi&s;dom. Too many in|&s;tances
have appeared, of per&s;ons, who, &s;etting
out in life with fair and virtuous purpo&s;es,
have been &s;o far bewildered by mi&s;taken
forms of goodne&s;s, as to be betrayed, fir&s;t
into errors, and then into vices and crimes.
In order to act our parts with propriety and
&s;teadine&s;s, there mu&s;t be a due proportion
of light in the under&s;tanding, as well as of
warmth and goodne&s;s in the heart. The
<PB N="197" REF="208">
P&s;almi&s;t was &s;en&s;ible of this when he de|clares
in the text his re&s;olution, of not only
<HI>walking in a perfect,</HI> or upright, <HI>way,</HI> but
of <HI>behaving him&s;elf wi&s;ely</HI> in that perfect
way. Of the wi&s;dom or prudence which
is nece&s;&s;ary to guide and &s;upport virtue, I
purpo&s;e to treat in this di&s;cour&s;e. I &s;hall
adventure, with great plainne&s;s and &s;impli|city
of language, to propo&s;e &s;ome practical
rules and directions for that purpo&s;e; which
may be of &s;ervice to per&s;ons, who, with
good di&s;po&s;itions and intentions, are begin|ning
the career of life; and which may, per|haps,
de&s;erve attention from per&s;ons in every
period of age.&mdash;I begin by ob&s;erving,</P>
<P>I. That it is mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to lay down
principles on which we are to form our
general conduct. If we &s;et out without
principles of any kind, there can be no re|gular
plan of life, nor any firmne&s;s in con|duct.
No per&s;on can know where they
are to find us; nor on what behaviour of
ours they are to depend. If the principles
which we pitch upon for determining our
<PB N="198" REF="209">
cour&s;e, be of a variable nature; &s;uch, for
in&s;tance, as popular opinion, reputation, or
worldly intere&s;t; as the&s;e are often &s;hifting
and changing, they can impart no &s;teadi|ne&s;s
or con&s;i&s;tency to conduct. Other
principles there are, which &s;ome affect to
adopt, founded on a &s;en&s;e of honour, on
the beauty and excellency of virtue, and
the dignity of human nature. But, how|ever
fair the&s;e may be in appearance, they
will be found ineffectual in many trying
&s;ituations; unable to repre&s;s the violence of
contending pa&s;&s;ions, or to &s;upport the heart
under many di&s;couragements and &s;orrows.</P>
<P>The only &s;ure principles we can lay
down for regulating our conduct, mu&s;t
be founded on the Chri&s;tian religion,
taken in its whole compa&s;s; not confined
to the exerci&s;es of devotion, nor to the
mere morality of &s;ocial behaviour; but ex|tending
to the whole direction of our con|duct
towards God and towards man. The
foundation is to be laid in faith in Chri&s;t
as the Saviour of the world, through who&s;e
merits only we can look for final accept|ance
<PB N="199" REF="210">
with God. We mu&s;t evince the
&s;incerity of our faith by good works; that
is, by a faithful di&s;charge of all the duties
incumbent upon us in our &s;everal &s;tations
of life: continually looking up to divine
grace for a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the part a&s;&s;igned
us to act; and tru&s;ting to that recompence
of our pre&s;ent labours, which is promi&s;ed to
the virtuous in a future and better world.&mdash;Suppo&s;ing,
that having laid the found|ation
in &s;uch principles, we &s;et forth to act
a worthy and virtuous part; re&s;olved, that
whatever may befal us, <HI>till we die, we will
not remove our integrity from us; that our
hearts &s;hall not reproach us &s;o long as we
live</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Job, xxvii. 5, 6.</NOTE>. I proceed to advi&s;e,</P>
<P>II. That we begin with reforming what|ever
has been wrong in our former be|haviour.
This coun&s;el is the more im|portant,
becau&s;e too many, in their endea|vours
towards reformation, begin with
attempting &s;ome of the highe&s;t virtues, or
<PB N="200" REF="211">
a&s;piring to the mo&s;t &s;ublime performances
of devotion, while they &s;uffer their former
accu&s;tomed evil habits to remain ju&s;t as
they were. This, I apprehend, is begin|ning
at the wrong end. We mu&s;t fir&s;t,
as the prophet has exhorted, <HI>put away the
evil of our doings from before God's eyes;</HI> we
mu&s;t <HI>cea&s;e to do evil, before we learn to do
well</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah, i. 16.</NOTE>. All attempts at reformation of
manners are vain, where this is not &s;tudied.
Let us remember, that as long as the weeds
and tares are allowed to remain in the
ground, the &s;oil is vitiated by their roots
&s;preading deep and wide; and no good
grain will have room to &s;pring up.&mdash;Every
man who in&s;pects his own character,
may learn that there are certain failings,
to which, from con&s;titution, circum&s;tances,
or long habit, he is prone; termed in
Scripture the <HI>&s;ins that mo&s;t ea&s;ily be&s;et us.</HI>
To di&s;cover the&s;e, mu&s;t be his fir&s;t care; and
his fir&s;t purpo&s;e, if he in truth wi&s;hes to be|come
a good man, mu&s;t be gradually to check,
<PB N="201" REF="212">
and finally to extirpate them, of whatever na|ture
they are; whether, perhaps, habits of
intemperance, unlawful indulgences of plea|&s;ure,
indirect methods of acquiring gain,
or propen&s;ions to malice, re&s;entment, or
envy. To overcome tho&s;e evils when they
have become inveterate, to pluck up tho&s;e
thorns by the roots, is perhaps the mo&s;t
difficult part of reformation, and therefore
what we are generally the mo&s;t backward
to undertake. At the &s;ame time it is cer|tain,
that as long as, by this tender indul|gence
to favourite vices, men remain in a
divided &s;tate between good re&s;olutions and
evil habits, they are &s;o far from behaving
<HI>wi&s;ely in a perfect way,</HI> that they can
&s;carcely be accounted to have entered on
that <HI>perfect way;</HI> irre&s;olution will be &s;pread
over their conduct, and incoherence will
mark their character.&mdash;In order to facilitate
&s;o nece&s;&s;ary a &s;tep in the progre&s;s towards
virtue, let me advi&s;e you,</P>
<P>III. To &s;hut up, as much as po&s;&s;ible,
the avenues which lead to the return of
<PB N="202" REF="213">
former evil habits. Here is required that
exerci&s;e of vigilance, &s;elf-di&s;tru&s;t, and &s;elf-denial,
which is &s;o often recommended to us
in &s;cripture. There is always &s;ome one
&s;ide on which each of us is more vulnerable
than on another. There are places, there
are times, there are circum&s;tances, which
every man who knows any thing of him&s;elf
at all, mu&s;t know will prove the occa&s;ions
of calling forth his latent frailties, and
bringing him into &s;ome fatal &s;nare. Then
ought that caution of the apo&s;tle to
&s;ound in his ears; <HI>Let him that thinketh
be &s;tandeth, take heed le&s;t he fall</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">1 Corinth. x. 12.</NOTE>. Let
him not only <HI>walk circum&s;pectly,</HI> but rather
altogether fly the dangerous ground; aware
of the viper which lurks under the gra&s;s,
ready to &s;ting. But pre&s;umption to flatter
our&s;elves, and to think that we are able
to with&s;tand every danger, is a weakne&s;s
inherent in man. It is on a moderate
and humble e&s;timation of our abilities,
that wi&s;dom directs us to form our
<PB N="203" REF="214">
conduct. As in civil and political life, he
who believes him&s;elf equal to every ta&s;k,
and on all occa&s;ions comes forward with
ra&s;h audacity, is likely to meet with many
a humiliation and repul&s;e; &s;o, in moral
behaviour, he who, tru&s;ting to the &s;trength
of his virtuous re&s;olutions, expo&s;es him&s;elf
incon&s;iderately to every occa&s;ion of tempta|tion,
is &s;ure of being often betrayed into evil.</P>
<P>All the various and dangerous avenues to
vice, with which, in great cities e&s;pecially,
modern life abounds, it cannot be expected
that I am here to point out. Wealth, lux|ury,
and idlene&s;s, are the great nouri&s;hers of
every frailty; the great fomenters of every
bad inclination and pa&s;&s;ion. To the children
of Idlene&s;s, the haunts of Di&s;&s;ipation open
many a wide and inviting gate by night
and by day. When within tho&s;e gates they
carele&s;sly enter, &s;urrounded with loo&s;e com|panions,
how often does it happen, that
from the halls of plea&s;ure and hou&s;es of
gaming, they come forth, as from caverns
of de&s;truction, overwhelmed with lo&s;&s;es and
mi&s;eries, and pining with bitter remor&s;e?&mdash;
<PB N="204" REF="215">
Much does it concern every one who &s;eeks
to <HI>walk wi&s;ely in a perfect way,</HI> to be parti|cularly
guarded in the choice of his a&s;&s;o|ciates
and companions. How often among
the gay and the giddy will he meet with
tho&s;e who &s;mile and betray! <HI>He only who
walketh with wi&s;e men, &s;hall be wi&s;e: while
the companion of fools &s;hall be de&s;troyed.</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xiii. 20.</NOTE>. Ob|&s;erve
the attention which, in the ver&s;es im|mediately
following the text, King David
declares him&s;elf to have given to this rule
of conduct; <HI>I will &s;et no wicked thing before
mine eyes; I will not know a wicked per&s;on.
Mine eyes &s;hall be on the faithful of the land.
He that worketh deceit, &s;hall not dwell within
my hou&s;e. He that telleth lies, &s;hall not tarry
in my pre&s;ence.</HI> Such was the wi&s;dom that
a&s;&s;i&s;ted him to continue in a perfect way.&mdash;This
wi&s;dom requires farther,</P>
<P>IV. THAT con&s;i&s;tency and uniformity be
pre&s;erved in character; that not by pieces
and corners only we &s;tudy goodne&s;s, but
that we carry one line of regular virtue
<PB N="205" REF="216">
through our whole conduct. Without this
exten&s;ive regulation of behaviour, we can
never hold on &s;ucce&s;sfully in a perfect way.
Almo&s;t all men, even the loo&s;e and profli|gate,
lay claim to &s;ome one virtue or other,
and value them&s;elves on &s;ome good moral
di&s;po&s;ition, which they boa&s;t of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing.
It is in vain, therefore, that we re&s;t our
character on one or a few e&s;timable quali|ties,
which we imagine our&s;elves to po&s;&s;e&s;s
in a high degree, while in other points of
virtue we are relaxed and deficient. True
virtue mu&s;t form one complete and entire
&s;y&s;tem. All its parts are connected; piety
with morality, charity with ju&s;tice, bene|volence
with temperance and fortitude. If
any of the&s;e parts be wanting, the fabric
becomes disjointed; the adver&s;e parts of
character corre&s;pond not to each other, nor
form into one whole. It is only when we
<HI>have re&s;pect unto all God's commandments,</HI> as
the P&s;almi&s;t &s;peaks, that we have rea&s;on <HI>not
to be a&s;hamed.</HI></P>
<P>The apology for many of tho&s;e breaches
of con&s;i&s;tency is always at hand, that the
<PB N="206" REF="217">
tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion is &s;mall, and can ea&s;ily be
repaired on a future occa&s;ion; and &s;mall
&s;ins, we imagine, may be compen&s;ated by
great and di&s;tingui&s;hed virtues. But no
&s;eduction is more dangerous, than this di&s;|tinction
which men are &s;o ready to make
between great and &s;mall &s;ins. Nothing is
more difficult, than to draw the line of this
di&s;tinction with any warrantable preci&s;ion.
Wherever inclination gives a &s;trong bias to
any indulgence, we may be a&s;&s;ured that we
&s;hall be always mi&s;led in mea&s;uring the
quantity of guilt. No &s;in is to be ac|counted
&s;mall, by which the dictate of con|&s;cience
is counteracted, and its authority is
weakened and impaired. It may &s;oon draw
con&s;equences after it, which will affect our
whole conduct. Suppo&s;ing the matter of
the&s;e tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions to be ever &s;o &s;mall in its
own nature, yet the moral characters of
men become &s;tained and bloated by their
frequent accumulations; ju&s;t as many &s;mall
ulcers, when allowed to form and &s;pread,
will grow by degrees into a great di&s;ea&s;e.&mdash;At
the &s;ame time, when I thus advi&s;e
<PB N="207" REF="218">
you to &s;tudy entire and con&s;i&s;tent virtue,
and to guard &s;trictly again&s;t &s;mall tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ions,
let me warn you,</P>
<P>V. AGAINST unnece&s;&s;ary au&s;terity, as
forming any part of religious wi&s;dom. This
is the meaning of the precept of Solo|mon,
<HI>Be not righteous overmuch; neither
make thy&s;elf over wi&s;e; why &s;hould&s;t thou
de&s;troy thy&s;elf</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. vii. 16.</NOTE>? Too &s;trict and &s;crupulous,
indeed, we cannot be in our adherence to
what is matter of clear duty. Every dic|tate
of con&s;cience is to be held &s;acred, and
to be obeyed without re&s;erve. But wi&s;|dom
requires that we &s;tudy to have con|&s;cience
properly enlightened with re&s;pect to
what really belongs to duty, or infers &s;in.
We mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h with care the everla&s;t|ing
commandments of God, from the &s;uper|&s;titious
fancies and dictates of men. We
mu&s;t never overload con&s;cience with what
is frivolous and unnece&s;&s;ary, nor exhau&s;t on
trifles, that zeal which ought to be re&s;erved
<PB N="208" REF="219">
for the weightier matters of the law. In all
ages, it has been the great characteri&s;tic of
fal&s;e pretenders to piety and religion, to
arrogate to them&s;elves uncommon &s;anctity,
by affected &s;trictne&s;s and &s;everity of man|ners;
paying tithes, like the Phari&s;ees of
old, of mint, ani&s;e, and cummin, while
they overlook righteou&s;ne&s;s, judgment, and
mercy. That religion which is connected
with true wi&s;dom, leads to a very different
&s;pirit. It will teach us to be neither rigid
in tri&s;les, nor relaxed in e&s;&s;entials; not to
aim at impracticable heights, nor to fall
below the &s;tandard of attainable duty;
never to make o&s;tentation of our righteou&s;|ne&s;s,
nor to &s;et our&s;elves up as patterns and
&s;tandards to others, but to be gentle and
una&s;&s;uming; without har&s;hne&s;s in our
manners, or &s;everity in our cen&s;ures, when
others depart in &s;ome particulars from our
mode of thinking on religious &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, we are to remember
that, in order to avoid au&s;terity, it by no
means follows that we &s;hould run into an
unlimited compliance with the manners of
<PB N="209" REF="220">
others around us. This is a danger to
which they are often expo&s;ed, who&s;e tem|pers
are mild, and who&s;e manners are con|de&s;cending.
In that mixed and various
intercour&s;e, which the pre&s;ent &s;tate of
&s;ociety forces upon us, few things, indeed,
are more difficult, than to a&s;certain the
preci&s;e degree of compliance with the world
which virtue allows. To pre&s;erve a ju&s;t
medium between a formal au&s;terity on the
one hand, and that weak and tame facility
on the other, which betrays men into many
vices, is one of the mo&s;t important and
arduous exerci&s;es of religious wi&s;dom. A
manly &s;teadine&s;s of conduct, is the object
which we are always to keep in view;
&s;tudying to unite gentlene&s;s of manners
with firmne&s;s of principle, affable beha|viour
with untainted integrity.</P>
<P>VI. In order to walk wi&s;ely in a perfect
way, it is of importance that we &s;tudy pro|priety
in our actions and general behaviour.
There are few preci&s;e rules of conduct that
can be applied alike to all men. In &s;ome
<PB N="210" REF="221">
of the fundamental virtues, indeed, no cir|cum&s;tances
can admit the lea&s;t variation.
There are no &s;ituations, for in&s;tance, in
which truth, ju&s;tice, and humanity, are
not required equally from all. But, in a
great number of the duties of life, the
manner of di&s;charging them mu&s;t vary,
according to the different ages, charac|ters,
and fortunes of men. To &s;uit our
behaviour to each of the&s;e; to judge of
the conduct which is mo&s;t decent and
becoming in our &s;ituation, is a material
part of wi&s;dom. Without this attention
to propriety, virtue will lo&s;e much of
its grace and efficacy; nay, good di&s;|po&s;itions
may degenerate into mere weak|ne&s;&s;es
and follies. The behaviour, for
in&s;tance, which would be engaging in
youth, is un&s;uitable to advanced years.
What is innocent gaiety in the one, be|comes
culpable levity in the other; and to
a&s;&s;ume in youth that authority and dignity
to which years only give any title, is im|pertinent
affectation. In like manner, to
the different ranks of men in &s;ociety, there
<PB N="211" REF="222">
belongs a different &s;train of manners.
Whatever is either above or below that
line of life in which Providence has placed
us, hurts every impartial ob&s;erver, and
&s;uits not the propriety of virtue. What
is proper dignity in one &s;tation, may, in
another, be pre&s;umptuous arrogance; and
while &s;uitable dependance belongs to
tho&s;e of inferiour rank, it ought not to
&s;ink into a degrading &s;ervility. With a
change in the &s;ituation of our fortunes,
our duties obviou&s;ly change. What was
commendable frugality in one condition,
may become &s;ordid par&s;imony as our e&s;tate
ri&s;es; and the genero&s;ity required of the
affluent, turns into extravagance and inju&s;|tice
when our circum&s;tances are impaired.&mdash;In
all tho&s;e attentions to propriety, &s;ome
regard will, of cour&s;e, be had to the opi|nions
which the world forms of us. No
man has a title to de&s;pi&s;e altogether what
the world thinks, and what it expects from
him. But this regard to the &s;entiments
of others, mu&s;t never go &s;o far as to en|croach
on what a man's own con&s;cience
<PB N="212" REF="223">
tells him, it is his duty either to do, or to
forbear doing. In the &s;cale by which we
mea&s;ure the propriety of our conduct, the
opinion of the world mu&s;t never be the
preponderating weight.&mdash;Let me recom|mend,</P>
<P>VII. THE ob&s;ervance of order and
regularity in the whole of conduct<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vide on this &s;ubject, Vol. ii. Sermon I.</NOTE>.
This may, at fir&s;t appearance, &s;eem an ar|ticle
of inferiour importance, and hardly de|&s;erving
to be ranked among moral duties.
But I am per&s;uaded that it is more nearly
connected with virtue than many per&s;ons
imagine; and that it maintains an import|ant
place in that wi&s;dom which directs a
perfect way. If ever you mean to carry a
con&s;i&s;tent line of virtue throughout your
conduct, you mu&s;t allot to every tran&s;action
its place and its &s;ea&s;on. Hurry and tumult,
di&s;order and confu&s;ion, are both the cha|racteri&s;tics
of vice and the parents of it.
Let your time be regularly di&s;tributed, and
<PB N="213" REF="224">
all your affairs be arranged with propriety,
in method and train. Thus, and thus
only, can you be ma&s;ters of your&s;elves;
your time and your life will be your own;
and what is &s;erious and important, will not
be ju&s;tled out of its place, by that crowd
of inferiour cares, which are for ever pre&s;&s;|ing
on the di&s;orderly, and fru&s;trating the
plans which they had formed for the wi&s;e
and proper regulation of life.&mdash;Con&s;ider
too, that if order be not &s;tudied, there can
be no prudent oeconomy in the manage|ment
of your fortune and worldly affairs;
and oeconomy, be a&s;&s;ured, is a great guar|dian
of all the private and dome&s;tic virtues.
When order and oeconomy are neglected,
you are in hazard of being fir&s;t involved
in di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and then inveigled into crimes;
whereas, under the direction of regular
conduct, both your worldly and your re|ligious
concerns will be more in the cour&s;e
of pro&s;pering.&mdash;I have now only to add,</P>
<P>VIII. THAT we &s;hould give attention
to all the auxiliary means which religion
<PB N="214" REF="225">
offers for a&s;&s;i&s;ting and guiding us to walk
wi&s;ely in a perfect way. The&s;e open a
large &s;ield to the care of every good man.
We mu&s;t always remember that virtue is
not a plant which will &s;pontaneou&s;ly grow
up and flouri&s;h in the human heart. The
&s;oil is far from being &s;o favourable to it;
many &s;hoots of an adver&s;e nature are ever
&s;pringing up, and much preparation and
culture are required for cheri&s;hing the
good &s;eed, and rai&s;ing it to full maturity.&mdash;
Among the means for this purpo&s;e, let me
fir&s;t mention the &s;erious reading of the holy
Scripture. That &s;acred book, as the &s;tand|ard
of our belief and practice, claims, on
every account, our frequent peru&s;al. In
the New Te&s;tament, the brighte&s;t di&s;play
of our Lord's energetic example, joined
with his &s;imple, affecting, and in&s;tructive
di&s;cour&s;es, illu&s;trated by the writings of
his in&s;pired followers; in the Old Te&s;ta|ment,
the variety of matter, the ardent
glow of devotion in &s;ome parts, and the
my&s;terious &s;ublimity of others; all con&s;pire
to affect the mind with &s;erious and &s;olemn
<PB N="215" REF="226">
emotions. Pa&s;&s;ages impre&s;&s;ed on the me|mory
from tho&s;e &s;acred volumes, have often,
from their recurrence, had a happy effect.
In our early years, mo&s;t of us were accu&s;|tomed
to look with re&s;pect upon tho&s;e ve|nerable
records; and woe be to them, who,
looking back upon the days of their father's
hou&s;e, can trample with &s;corn on the me|mory
of tho&s;e, who&s;e pious cares were em|ployed
in forming them to good principles,
and teaching them to reverence the word
of God!&mdash;Let me next recommend a
&s;erious regard to all the e&s;tabli&s;hed means
of religious in&s;truction; &s;uch as, attending
regularly the preaching of the word, par|taking
frequently of the holy &s;acrament, and
pre&s;erving a &s;acred reverence for the Lord's
day. Whenever all regard to the Lord's
day becomes aboli&s;hed; when on it we are
allowed to mingle without any di&s;tinction
in our common affairs, and even in our
ordinary diver&s;ions and amu&s;ements, we
may account this a certain &s;ymptom of
declining virtue, and of approaching ge|neral
immorality. We have beheld in a
<PB N="216" REF="227">
neighbouring kingdom, how fatally it proved
the forerunner of an entire di&s;&s;olution both
of moral and civil order in &s;ociety. What|ever
di&s;regard certain modern refiners of
morality may attempt to throw on all the
in&s;tituted means of public religion, a&s;|&s;uredly
they mu&s;t, in their lowe&s;t view,
be con&s;idered as the outguards and fences
of virtuous conduct; and even in this view,
mu&s;t de&s;erve the e&s;teem and re&s;pect of
all good men. We know, and are often
enough told, that the <HI>form of godline&s;s</HI> may
&s;ub&s;i&s;t without the <HI>power</HI> of it. But de|pend
upon it, wherever <HI>the form of godline&s;s</HI>
is entirely gone, the ruin of its <HI>power</HI> is
not far off. Whoever has &s;tudied the
human mind may &s;oon be &s;atisfied of this
truth.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides attention to the public means
of religious improvement, much will de|pend
on our own private exerci&s;es of devo|tion
and &s;erious thought. Prayer, in par|ticular,
operates to our high advantage, both
by the immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance which we may
hope it will procure from Him who is the
<PB N="217" REF="228">
authour and in&s;pirer of virtue, and by its
native influence in &s;oftening, purifying, and
exalting the heart. In vain would he at|tempt
to behave him&s;elf wi&s;ely in a perfect
way, who looks not frequently up to God
for grace and aid; and who would pre|&s;umptuou&s;ly
attempt to &s;eparate moral virtue
from devotion, its natural and original ally.
Be&s;ides the exerci&s;es of religious wor&s;hip
both public and private, &s;ea&s;onable returns of
retirement from the world, of calm recol|lection
and &s;erious thought, are mo&s;t im|portant
auxiliaries to virtue. He who is
without intermi&s;&s;ion engaged in the bu&s;tle
of &s;ociety and worldly occupation, becomes
incapable of exerci&s;ing that di&s;cipline over
him&s;elf, and giving that attention to his
temper and character which virtue requires.
<HI>Commune with your own hearts on your
bed, and be &s;till. Offer the &s;acrifices of
righteou&s;ne&s;s, and put your tru&s;t in the Lord</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm iv. 4, 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BY the ob&s;ervance of &s;uch rules and
maxims as have been now pointed out, it may
<PB N="218" REF="229">
be hoped that, through divine grace, we may
be enabled to <HI>behave our&s;elves wi&s;ely in a
perfect way,</HI> until, in the end, we receive
the reward of &s;uch behaviour. The wi&s;|dom
here &s;poken of as conjoined with
virtue, is that <HI>wi&s;dom from above,</HI> which
is appointed by God to enlighten and guide
the cour&s;e of integrity. It opens to us
that <HI>path of the ju&s;t,</HI> which is now as <HI>the
&s;hining light,</HI> and which will <HI>&s;hine more and

their hope; <HI>we know,</HI> that if our <HI>earthly
hou&s;e be di&s;&s;olved, we have a building of

<P>I. THE text gives a full de&s;cription of
our pre&s;ent embodied &s;tate; as an <HI>earthly
hou&s;e,</HI> an <HI>earthly hou&s;e of this tabernacle,</HI>
and a tabernacle which is to <HI>be di&s;&s;olved.</HI></P>
<P>We dwell in an <HI>earthly hou&s;e.</HI> Within

&s;aid in Scripture, to have <HI>our foundation in
the du&s;t,</HI> and to <HI>dwell in hou&s;es of clay.</HI>
<PB N="221" REF="232">
During its continuance in this humble
abode, the &s;oul may be ju&s;tly con&s;idered as
confined and impri&s;oned. It is re&s;trained
from the full exertion of its powers by
many ob&s;tructions. It can perceive and act
only by very imperfect organs. It looks
abroad as through the windows of the
&s;en&s;es; and beholds truth as <HI>through a gla&s;s
darkly.</HI> It is be&s;et with a numerous train
of temptations to evil, which ari&s;e from
bodily appetites. It is obliged to &s;ympa|thize
with the body in its wants; and is
depre&s;&s;ed with infirmities not its own. For
it &s;uffers from the frailty of tho&s;e materials
of which its earthly hou&s;e is compacted.
It langui&s;hes and droops, along with the
body; is wounded by its pains; and the
&s;lighte&s;t di&s;compo&s;ure of bodily organs is
&s;ufficient to derange &s;ome of the highe&s;t
operations of the &s;oul.</P>
<P>All the&s;e circum&s;tances bear the marks
of a fallen and degraded &s;tate of human
nature. The man&s;ion in which the &s;oul is
lodged, corre&s;ponds &s;o little with the powers
and capacities of a rational immortal &s;pirit,
<PB N="222" REF="233">
as gives us rea&s;on to think that the &s;ouls of
good men were not de&s;igned to remain
always thus confined. Such a &s;tate was
calculated for an&s;wering the ends propo&s;ed
by our condition of trial and probation in
this life; but was not intended to be la&s;t|ing
and final. Accordingly the Apo&s;tle, in
his de&s;cription, calls it the earthly hou&s;e <HI>of
this tabernacle;</HI> alluding to a wayfaring or
&s;ojourning &s;tate, where tabernacles or tents
are occa&s;ionally erected for the accommo|dation
of pa&s;&s;engers. The &s;ame metaphor
is here made u&s;e of, which is employed
in &s;everal other pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture, where
we are &s;aid to be <HI>&s;trangers and &s;ojourners
on earth before God, as were all our fathers.</HI>
This earth may be compared to a wide
field &s;pread with tents, where troops of
pilgrims appear in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion and pa&s;s away.
They enter for a little into the tents pre|pared
for them; and remain there to un|dergo
their appointed probation. When
that is fini&s;hed, their tents are taken down,
and they retire, to make way for others,
who come forward in their allotted order.
<PB N="223" REF="234">
Thus <HI>one generation pa&s;&s;eth away, and ano|ther
generation cometh;</HI> and the <HI>earthly hou&s;e</HI>
is to all no other than the <HI>hou&s;e of their
pilgrimage.</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm exix. 54.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The <HI>earthly hou&s;e of this tabernacle,</HI> the
Apo&s;tle, proceeding in his de&s;cription, tells
us, is <HI>to be di&s;&s;olved.</HI> Clo&s;e as the union
between the &s;oul and body now appears
to be, it is no more than a temporary
union. It &s;ub&s;i&s;ts only during the con|tinuance
of a tabernacle of du&s;t, which, by
its nature, is tending towards ruin. The
<HI>du&s;t mu&s;t</HI> &s;oon <HI>return to the du&s;t, and the
&s;pirit to God who gave it.</HI>&mdash;The di&s;&s;o|lution
of the <HI>earthly hou&s;e of this tabernacle,</HI>
is an event full of di&s;may to wicked men.
Beyond that period they &s;ee nothing but
a dark unknown, which, as far as they
can di&s;cern, is peopled with objects full
of terrour; even to the ju&s;t, this di&s;&s;o|lution
is a &s;erious and awful event. Pro|vidence
has wi&s;ely appointed, that burdened
as our pre&s;ent &s;tate is, with various ills and
<PB N="224" REF="235">
frailties, we &s;hould, however, be naturally
attached to it. Its final clo&s;e is always at|tended
with &s;everal melancholy ideas.&mdash;
Thou who now flouri&s;he&s;t mo&s;t in health
and &s;trength, mu&s;t then have thy head laid
low. From thy clo&s;ing eyes the light of
the &s;un &s;hall di&s;appear for ever. That light
&s;hall continue to &s;hine, the &s;ea&s;ons to re|turn,
and the earth to flouri&s;h; but to thee
no more, &s;eparated from the dwellings of
men, and cut off from all thou wert accu&s;|tomed
to love, as though thou had&s;t never
been.&mdash;Such is the fate of man con&s;idered
merely as mortal; as dwelling in an earthly
hou&s;e which is about to be di&s;&s;olved. The
con&s;olatory corrective of tho&s;e humbling
ideas, the ray that is to di&s;&s;ipate this gloom,
we behold in the &s;ub&s;equent part of the text;
that when this earthly hou&s;e is di&s;&s;olved,
there is prepared for the righteous <HI>a build|ing
of God, an hou&s;e not made with hands,</HI>
But before proceeding to this part of the
&s;ubject, let us pau&s;e for a little, and make
&s;ome reflections on what has been already
&s;aid.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="236">
LET the di&s;tinction between the &s;oul and
the body, which is &s;o clearly marked in
the text, be deeply imprinted on our minds.
Few things in religion or morals are en|titled
to make a &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion than
this di&s;tinction; and yet, with the bulk of
men, the impre&s;&s;ion it makes appears to
be &s;light. They &s;eem to think and act as
if they con&s;i&s;ted of no more than mere
fle&s;h and blood, and had no other concerns
than what re&s;pect their embodied &s;tate. If
their health be firm, if their &s;en&s;es be gra|tified,
and their appetites indulged, all is
well with them. Is not this to forget that
the body is no more than an <HI>earthly hou&s;e</HI>
or <HI>tabernacle</HI> of the &s;oul? The &s;oul, that
thinking part which they feel within them,
and which it is impo&s;&s;ible for them to con|found
with their fle&s;h or their bones, is
certainly far nobler than the tenement of
clay which it inhabits. The &s;oul is the
principle of all life, and knowledge, and
action. The body is no more than its in|&s;trument,
or organ; and as much nobler as is
the part which belongs to him who employs
<PB N="226" REF="237">
an in&s;trument, than to the in&s;trument
which is employed, &s;o much is the &s;oul of
greater dignity than the body. The one
is only a frail and peri&s;hable machine; the
other &s;urvives its ruin, and lives for ever.
&mdash;During the time that the union con|tinues
between tho&s;e two very different
parts of our frame, I by no means &s;ay that
it is incumbent upon us to di&s;regard all
that relates to the body. It is not po&s;&s;ible,
nor though it were po&s;&s;ible, would it be
requi&s;ite or &s;it, for man to act as if he were
pure immaterial &s;pirit. This is what the
condition and laws of our nature permit
not.&mdash;But mu&s;t not the greate&s;t &s;en&s;uali&s;t
admit, that if the &s;oul be the chief part of
man, it mu&s;t have intere&s;ts of its own,
which require to be carefully attended to?
Can he imagine that he truly con&s;ults either
his intere&s;t or his plea&s;ure, if he employs
the thinking part of his nature only to
&s;erve, and to mini&s;ter to the bodily part?
Mu&s;t not this infer, not merely a degra|dation
of the &s;uperiour part, but an entire
perver&s;ion of that whole con&s;titution of
<PB N="227" REF="238">
nature which our Maker hath given us?
Be a&s;&s;ured, my brethren, that the &s;oul hath
a health and a &s;ickne&s;s, hath plea&s;ures and
pains of its own, quite di&s;tinct from tho&s;e
of the body, and which have a powerful
influence on the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of
man. He who pays no attention to the&s;e,
and neglects all care of pre&s;erving the
health and &s;oundne&s;s of his &s;oul, is not
only preparing final mi&s;ery for him&s;elf when
he &s;hall enter into a di&s;embodied e&s;tate,
but is laying, even for his pre&s;ent &s;tate,
the foundation of many a bitter di&s;tre&s;s.
By folly and guilt he is <HI>wounding his &s;pirit.</HI>
Its wounds will often bleed when his body
appears &s;ound, and will give ri&s;e to inward
pangs which no animal comforts &s;hall be
able to a&s;&s;uage or heal.</P>
<P>When we impre&s;s our minds with a
&s;en&s;e of this important di&s;tinction between
the body and the &s;oul, let us not forget,
that clo&s;ely united as they now are in our
frame, their union is &s;oon to terminate.
<HI>The earthly hou&s;e of this tabernacle is to
be di&s;&s;olved;</HI> but the &s;oul which inhabits
<PB N="228" REF="239">
it remains. Let us therefore dwell in our
earthly hou&s;e with the &s;entiments of tho&s;e
who know they are about to di&s;lodge.
The endowments and improvements of
the &s;oul are the only po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions on which
we can reckon as continuing to be our
own. On every po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion which belongs
to our bodily e&s;tate, we ought to view this
in&s;cription as written by God; &startq;This is
art earthly hou&s;e which is tottering to its
fall; This is a tabernacle which is about
to be taken down.&endq;&mdash;Let us with plea|&s;ure
turn our thoughts towards tho&s;e higher
pro&s;pects that are &s;et before us, when
this change &s;hall have taken place in the
human condition; which naturally brings
us to the</P>
<P>IId Head of di&s;cour&s;e,&mdash;the great object
of the hope of good men in a &s;ucceeding

of God, an hou&s;e not made with hands,</HI>
are expre&s;&s;ions of a my&s;terious import.
They &s;ugge&s;t to us things which we cannot
now conceive, far le&s;s de&s;cribe. Into that
hou&s;e which is above, tho&s;e habitations
of eternity, no living man has entered, to
explore them, and to report to us tidings
of what he there beheld. A &s;acred veil
conceals the man&s;ions of glory. But, in
general, the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of the text plainly
import that the &s;pirits of good men &s;hall,
upon death, be tran&s;lated from an im|perfect
to a glorious &s;tate. Whether we
explain <HI>the building of God, the hou&s;e not
made with hands,</HI> to &s;ignify the incor|ruptible
bodies which the ju&s;t &s;hall animate
at the re&s;urrection, or the habitations of
cele&s;tial glory into which they enter, they are
terms which convey ideas of high magnifi|cence
and felicity. This earth on which we
dwell, is no more than an exteriour region
of the great kingdom of God. It is but an
entrance, through which, after &s;uitable pre|paration,
<PB N="230" REF="241">
we pa&s;s into the palace of an
Almighty Sovereign. Admitted there, we
may hope to behold far greater objects
than we now can behold; and to enjoy
in perfection tho&s;e plea&s;ures which we
here view from afar, and pur&s;ue in vain.
Such degrees of plea&s;ure are allowed us at
pre&s;ent as our &s;tate admits. But a &s;tate of
trial required that pains &s;hould be inter|mixed
with our plea&s;utes, and that infir|mity
and di&s;tre&s;s &s;hould often be felt. The
remains of our fall appear every where in
our condition. The ruins of human na|ture
pre&s;ent them&s;elves on all hands. But
<HI>when that which is perfect is come, that
which is in part &s;hall be done away.</HI> With
the fall of the earthly hou&s;e, all its rotten
and corruptible materials &s;hall di&s;appear.
<HI>It is &s;own in corruption,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle,
&s;peaking of the happy change made upon
good men at the re&s;urrection, <HI>it is rai&s;ed
in incorruption; it is &s;own in di&s;honour, it
is rai&s;ed in glory; it is &s;own in weakne&s;s, it
is rai&s;ed in power; it is &s;own a natural, it
is rai&s;ed a &s;piritual body:&mdash;for this corrup|tible
<PB N="231" REF="242">
&s;hall put on incorruption, and this mortal,
put on immortality.</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">1 Corinth xv. 42&ndash;53.</NOTE>&mdash;Into that <HI>hou&s;e not
made with hands, that building of God,</HI>
we have every rea&s;on to believe that
there will be no room for &s;uch gue&s;ts
to intrude as care or &s;orrow. Nothing
can be admitted to enter there, but what
contributes to the felicity of tho&s;e whom
the Almighty hath allowed to dwell in
his pre&s;ence, and to <HI>behold his face in
righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the glory and perfection of this
future &s;tate, the text &s;ugge&s;ts its perma|nency.
This hou&s;e <HI>not made with hands,</HI>
is <HI>a hou&s;e eternal in the heavens.</HI> The ta|bernacle
which we now inhabit is every
moment liable to fall: above, is the fixed
man&s;ion, the &s;eat of perpetual re&s;t. Be|yond
doubt, the certain pro&s;pect of death
renders every thing incon&s;iderable which
we here po&s;&s;e&s;s. Every enjoyment is &s;ad|dened,
when we think of its end approach|ing.
We become &s;en&s;ible that we are
<PB N="232" REF="243">
always building on &s;and, never on a rock.
Fluctuation and change characteri&s;e all
that is around us; and at the moment
when our attachment to any per&s;ons or
objects is become the &s;tronge&s;t, they are
beginning to &s;lide away from our hold.
But in the man&s;ions above, alteration and
decay are unknown. Every thing there
continues in a &s;teady cour&s;e. No &s;chemes
are there begun, and left unfini&s;hed; no
plea&s;ing connexions ju&s;t formed, and then
broken off. The trea&s;ures po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed there
&s;hall never be dimini&s;hed; the friends we
enjoy there &s;hall never die, and leave us to
mourn. In tho&s;e cele&s;tial regions, &s;hines
the &s;un that never &s;ets; the calm reigns,
which is never di&s;turbed; the river of life
flows with a &s;tream, which is always un|ruffled
in its cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Such are the pro&s;pects, imperfectly as
we can now conceive them, which are &s;et
forth to good men in a future world. But
how, it may be a&s;ked, &s;hall we be &s;atisfied
that &s;uch pro&s;pects are not mere illu&s;ions
with which our fancy flatters us. Upon
<PB N="233" REF="244">
what foundations re&s;ts this mighty edifice
of hope, which the Apo&s;tle here rears up
for the con&s;olation of Chri&s;tians, and of
which he &s;peaks &s;o con&s;idently as to &s;ay,
<HI>We know that if our earthly hou&s;e of
this tabernacle were di&s;&s;olved, we have a
building of God?</HI>&mdash;To enquire into this
was the</P>
<P>IIId propo&s;ed Head of di&s;cour&s;e, to which
we now proceed. And as the &s;ubject is in
it&s;elf &s;o important, and &s;o plea&s;ing to all
good men, I &s;hall take a view of the dif|ferent
kinds of evidence, upon which our
faith of a happy immortality is grounded.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t ob&s;erve, in the fir&s;t place, that
the di&s;&s;olution of the earthly tabernacle at
death, affords no ground for thinking that
the &s;oul at the &s;ame time peri&s;hes, or is ex|tingui&s;hed.
I begin with this ob&s;ervation,
becau&s;e the &s;tronge&s;t prejudices again&s;t the
&s;oul's immortality, ari&s;e from what is &s;ome|times
found to happen at that period. The
&s;oul and the body are at pre&s;ent united by
the clo&s;e&s;t &s;ympathy. When one &s;uffers,
<PB N="234" REF="245">
the other is affected. Both &s;eem to grow
up together to the maturity of their powers;
and together both &s;eem often to decay.
Such a &s;hock is apparently &s;uffered by the
&s;oul at death, as at fir&s;t view might lead
us to &s;u&s;pect that it was &s;haring the &s;ame
fate with the body. Notwith&s;tanding this,
there are clear proofs that the body and the
&s;oul, though at pre&s;ent clo&s;ely connected by
divine appointment with one another, are,
however, &s;ub&s;tances of different and di&s;&s;i|milar
natures. Matter, of which the body
is compo&s;ed, is a &s;ub&s;tance altogether dead
and pa&s;&s;ive, and cannot be put in motion
without &s;ome external impul&s;e. Whereas
the &s;oul hath within it&s;elf a principle of
motion, activity and life. Between the
laws of matter, and the action of thought,
there is &s;o little re&s;emblance, or rather &s;o
much oppo&s;ition, that mankind in general
have agreed in holding the &s;oul to be an
immaterial &s;ub&s;tance; that is, a &s;ub&s;tance
the nature of which we cannot explain or
define further than that it is a &s;ub&s;tance
quite di&s;tinct from matter. This being
<PB N="235" REF="246">
once admitted, it clearly follows, that &s;ince
thought depends not on matter, from the
di&s;&s;olution of the material part we have no
ground to infer the de&s;truction of the think|ing
part of man. As long as by the ordi|nation
of the Creator the&s;e different &s;ub|&s;tances
remain united, there is no wonder
that the one &s;hould &s;uffer from the di&s;order
or indi&s;po&s;ition of the other.</P>
<P>It is &s;o far from following that the &s;oul
mu&s;t cea&s;e to act on the di&s;&s;olution of the
body, that it &s;eems rather to follow, that it
will then act in a more perfect manner.
In its pre&s;ent habitation, it is plainly limited
and confined in its operations. When it is
let loo&s;e from that earthly hou&s;e, it is
brought forth into greater liberty. To
illu&s;trate this by an in&s;tance which may be
conceived as analogous; let us &s;uppo&s;e a
per&s;on &s;hut up in an apartment, where he
&s;aw light only through &s;ome &s;mall windows.
If the&s;e windows were &s;oul or dimmed, he
would &s;ee le&s;s; if they were altogether
darkened, he could &s;ee none at all. But
were he let out from this confinement into
<PB N="236" REF="247">
the open air, he would be &s;o far from being
deprived of &s;ight, that though at fir&s;t over|powered
by a &s;udden glare, he would &s;oon
&s;ee around him much more completely
than before. The &s;en&s;es are as &s;o many
windows or apertures, through which the
&s;oul at pre&s;ent exerci&s;es its powers of per|ception.
If the &s;en&s;es are di&s;ordered, the
powers of the &s;oul will be ob&s;tructed. But
once &s;eparated from its earthly tenement,
the &s;oul will then exerci&s;e its powers with|out
ob&s;truction; will act with greater liberty,
and in a wider &s;phere.&mdash;I admit this ar|gument
only goes as far as to &s;how, that
although the body peri&s;h, there remains
with the &s;oul a capacity for &s;eparate ex|i&s;tence.
Whether that exi&s;tence &s;hall be
actually continued to it after death, mu&s;t
depend on the will of Him who gave
it life, and who certainly at his plea&s;ure
can take that life away. It is nece&s;&s;ary,
therefore, to enquire into what, we have
any rea&s;on to believe, may be the in|tention
of our Creator concerning a future
life.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="248">
I argue then, in the next place, that if
the &s;oul were to peri&s;h when the body dies,
the &s;tate of man would be altogether un|&s;uitable
to the wi&s;dom and perfection of the
Author of his being. Man would be the
only creature that would &s;eem to have been
made in vain. All the other works of God
are contrived to an&s;wer exactly the pur|po&s;es
for which they were made. They
are either incapable of knowledge at all;
or, they know nothing higher than the
&s;tate in which they are placed. Their
powers are perfectly &s;uited and adju&s;ted to
their condition. But it is not &s;o with man.
He has every appearance of being framed
for &s;omething higher and greater than what
he here attains. He &s;ees the narrow bounds
within which he is here confined; knows
and laments all the imperfections of his
pre&s;ent &s;tate. His thir&s;t for knowledge,
his de&s;ires of happine&s;s, all &s;tretch beyond
his earthly &s;tation. He &s;earches in vain for
adequate objects to gratify him. His nature
is perpetually tending and a&s;piring towards
the enjoyment of &s;ome more complete feli|city
<PB N="238" REF="249">
city than this world can afford. In the
mid&s;t of all his &s;earches and a&s;pirations, he
is &s;uddenly cut off. He is but of ye&s;terday,
and to-morrow is gone. Often in the
entrance, often in the bloom of life, when
he had ju&s;t begun to act his part, and to
expand his powers, darkne&s;s is made to
cover him.&mdash;Can we believe, that when
this period is come, all is finally over with
the be&s;t and the worthie&s;t of mankind?
Endowed with &s;o noble an apparatus of
rational powers, taught to form high views
and enlarged de&s;ires, were they brought forth
for no other purpo&s;e, than to breathe this
gro&s;s and impure air for a &s;hort &s;pace, and
then to be cut off from all exi&s;tence? All
his other works, God hath made in <HI>weight,
number, and mea&s;ure;</HI> the hand of the Al|mighty
artificer every where appears. But
on man, his chief work here below, he
would, upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, appear to
have be&s;towed no attention; and after
having erected a &s;tately palace in this
univer&s;e, framed with &s;o much magnifi|cence,
and decorated with &s;o much beauty,
<PB N="239" REF="250">
to have introduced man, in the gui&s;e of a
neglected wanderer, to become its inhabitant.</P>
<P>Let us farther con&s;ider the confu&s;ed and
promi&s;euous di&s;tribution of good and evil
in this life. The enjoyments of the world,
&s;uch as they are, are far from being always
be&s;towed on the virtuous and the worthy.
On the contrary, the bittere&s;t portion is
often their lot. In the mid&s;t of infirmities,
di&s;ea&s;es, and &s;orrows, they are left to drag
their life, while ea&s;e and affluence are
allowed to the ungodly.&mdash;I mu&s;t a&s;k, if
&s;uch an arrangement of things, owing to
the ordination, or, at lea&s;t, to the permi&s;|&s;ion
of Providence, be con&s;onant to any
ideas we can form of the wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s
of a Supreme Ruler, on the &s;uppo&s;ition
of there being no future &s;tate?&mdash;But as
&s;oon as the immortality of the &s;oul, and a
&s;tate of future retribution are e&s;tabli&s;hed, all
difficulties vani&s;h; the my&s;tery is unra|velled;
&s;upreme wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice, and good|ne&s;s,
are di&s;covered to be only concealed
for a little while behind the curtain. If
that curtain were never to be withdrawn,
<PB N="240" REF="251">
and immortality never to appear, the ways
of God would be utterly inexplicable to
man. We would be obliged to conclude
that either a God did not exi&s;t; or though
he exi&s;ted, that he was not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch
perfections as we now a&s;cribe to him, if
when a worthy and pious man had &s;pent
his whole life in virtuous deeds, and perhaps
had died a martyr to the cau&s;e of religion
and truth; he &s;hould, after long and &s;evere
&s;ufferings, peri&s;h finally, unrewarded and
forgotten; no attention &s;hown to him by
the Almighty; no <HI>building of God</HI> erected
for him; no <HI>hou&s;e eternal</HI> prepared in the
Heavens!</P>
<P>THESE rea&s;onings are much &s;trengthened
by the belief that has ever prevailed among
all mankind, of the &s;oul's immortality. It is
not an opinion that took its ri&s;e from the
thin &s;pun &s;peculations of &s;ome ab&s;tract phi|lo&s;ophers.
Never has any nation been di&s;|covered
on the face of the earth &s;o rude
and barbarous, that in mid&s;t of their wilde&s;t
&s;uper&s;titions there was not cheri&s;hed among
<PB N="241" REF="252">
them &s;ome expectation of a &s;tate after death,
in which the virtuous were to enjoy happi|ne&s;s.
So univer&s;al a con&s;ent in this belief,
affords ju&s;t ground to a&s;cribe it to &s;ome
innate principle implanted by God in the
human brea&s;t. Had it no foundation in
truth, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that the Creator
found it nece&s;&s;ary, for the purpo&s;es of his
government, to carry on a principle of
univer&s;al deception among his rational &s;ub|jects.
Many of the &s;tronge&s;t pa&s;&s;ions of
our nature are made to have a clear re|ference
to the future exi&s;tence of the &s;oul.
The love of &s;ame, the ardent concern which
&s;o often prevails about futurity, all allude to
&s;omewhat in which men &s;uppo&s;e them&s;elves
to be per&s;onally concerned, after death.
The con&s;ciences, both of the good and the
bad, bear witne&s;s to a world that is to
come. Seldom do men leave this world
without &s;ome fears or hopes re&s;pecting it;
&s;ome &s;ecret anticipations and pre&s;ages of
what is hereafter to befal them.</P>
<P>But though the rea&s;onings which have
been adduced to prove the immortality of
<PB N="242" REF="253">
the &s;oul and a future &s;tate, are certainly of
great weight, yet rea&s;onings &s;till they are,
and no more; and in every human rea&s;on|ing,
&s;u&s;picions may ari&s;e of &s;ome fallacy or
error. In a point &s;o momentous to us, as
our exi&s;tence after death, we never could,
with ab&s;olute certainty and full &s;atisfaction,
have re&s;ted on any evidence except what
was confirmed by the declaration of God
him&s;elf.&mdash;For many and high ble&s;&s;ings we
are indebted to the Chri&s;tian revelation;
for none more than for its having <HI>brought
life and immortality to light.</HI> The re|velations
made by God to the world in
early ages, gave the fir&s;t openings to this
great article of faith and hope. In fu|ture
periods, the light dawned more and
more; but it was not until the &s;un of
righteou&s;ne&s;s aro&s;e by the appearance of
Chri&s;t on earth, that the great di&s;covery
was completed. Then, indeed, were made
known the <HI>city of the living God,</HI> the <HI>new
Jeru&s;alem</HI> above, the <HI>man&s;ions</HI> prepared for
the <HI>&s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect.</HI> Nor
was a &s;tate of future felicity only proclaimed
<PB N="243" REF="254">
by Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles to good men,
but was repre&s;ented as purcha&s;ed for them
by the death of their Redeemer. <HI>I give,</HI>
he was authori&s;ed to &s;ay, <HI>unto my &s;heep
eternal life. In my father's hou&s;e are many
man&s;ions. I go to prepare a place for you</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">John, x. 28.&mdash;xiv. 2.</NOTE>.
Accordingly, he lay down in the grave;
ro&s;e as the <HI>fir&s;t fruits of them that &s;lept;</HI>
and a&s;cending into Heaven, entered there
within the veil, as the <HI>forerunner</HI> of his
followers, to a&s;&s;ure them of all being
friendly and well-di&s;po&s;ed towards them in
tho&s;e upper regions. All therefore who
live and die in the faith and obedience of
Je&s;us, are entitled to &s;ay with the Apo&s;tle,
<HI>we know;</HI> not only we hope and we rea|&s;on,
but <HI>we know, that if our earthly hou&s;e of
this tabernacle were di&s;&s;olved, we have a
building of God, an hou&s;e not made with
hands, eternal in the Heavens.</HI></P>
<P>THE fir&s;t and mo&s;t natural improvement
of all that has been &s;aid, is to produce in
<PB N="244" REF="255">
our hearts the mo&s;t la&s;ting gratitude, love,
and reverence, towards that great benefactor
of mankind, who not only hath made
known and publi&s;hed the ble&s;&s;ings of a
future &s;tate to the righteous, but by his
great undertaking for their redemption
hath erected in their behalf the <HI>hou&s;e eternal
in the heavens.</HI>&mdash;The next improvement
we &s;hould make, is to conduct our own life
and behaviour as becomes tho&s;e who have
an intere&s;t in this happine&s;s and this hope.
From &s;uch per&s;ons a&s;&s;uredly is to be ex|pected
a pure, correct, and dignified beha|viour
in every &s;ituation; not a contempt of
the employments, nor a renunciation of all
the comforts of their pre&s;ent life. Opinions
that produce &s;uch effects are connected
only with the &s;pirit of &s;uper&s;tition and fal&s;e
religion. But to them it belongs, in mid&s;t
of the affairs, enticements, and temptations
of the world, to regulate their conduct
as becomes the heirs of a divine inherit|ance;
never deba&s;ing them&s;elves among
what is mean, nor de&s;iling them&s;elves with
what is corrupt in the pre&s;ent &s;tate; but
<PB N="245" REF="256">
&s;erving God with that &s;idelity, and behav|ing
to men with that &s;teady magnanimity
of virtue, that generous beneficence and
humanity, which &s;uits immortal beings,
who are a&s;piring to ri&s;e in a future &s;tate to
the perfection of their nature, in the pre|&s;ence
of God.</P>

<Q>Be not overcome of evil; but overcome evil
with good.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN this world,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XI.</NOTE> we all know that we mu&s;t
reckon upon a mixture of goods and
evils. Some of the evils are owing to the
appointment of Providence in this &s;tate of
trial; many of them are the fruits of our
own guilt and mi&s;conduct. The goods
and the evils of our &s;tate are &s;o blended, as
often to render the whole of human life a
&s;truggle between them. We have to con|tend
both with the evils of fortune, and
<PB N="247" REF="258">
with the evils of our own depravity; and
it is only he who can in &s;ome mea&s;ure
overcome both, that is to be e&s;teemed the
wi&s;e, the virtuous, and the happy man.
At the &s;ame time, amid&s;t the evils of dif|ferent
kinds which a&s;&s;ault us, there is a
principle of good, derived from Heaven,
by which we may hope to acquire &s;trength,
and through divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance be enabled to
overcome the evils of our &s;tate. This is the
&s;ubject of the exhortation in the text, <HI>Be
not overcome of evil: but overcome evil with
good.</HI> Taken in its mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e,
as re&s;pecting the different kinds of evil
which we have to overcome, the exhorta|tion
may be under&s;tood to compri&s;e the
three following particulars. In the fir&s;t
place, Be not overcome by the injuries you
meet with in the world, &s;o as to pur&s;ue
revenge. Secondly, Be not overcome by
the di&s;a&s;ters of the world, &s;o as to &s;ink into
de&s;pair. Thirdly, Be not overcome by the
evil examples of the world, &s;o as to follow
them into &s;in. But in all tho&s;e ca&s;es,
<HI>overcome evil with good.</HI> Overcome in|juries,
<PB N="248" REF="259">
by forgivene&s;s. Overcome di&s;a&s;ters,
by fortitude. Overcome evil examples, by
firmne&s;s of principle.</P>
<P>I. BE not overcome by the injuries you
meet with in the world, &s;o as to pur&s;ue
revenge. It appears from the context, that
this was the primary object which the
Apo&s;tle had in his view in this exhortation.
He refers to the injuries which the pri|mitive
Chri&s;tians were con&s;tantly &s;uffering
from their per&s;ecutors. In&s;tead of being
&s;o much overcome by the&s;e as to be intent
on revenge, his exhortation in the ver&s;es
preceding the text is, <HI>Dearly beloved,
avenge not your&s;elves, but rather give place
unto wrath; for it is written, vengeance is
mine, I will repay, faith the Lord. There|fore,
if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he
thir&s;t, give him drink; for in &s;o doing thou
&s;halt heap coals of fire on his head. Be not
overcome of evil; but overcome evil with
good.</HI> But it is not in times only of per|&s;ecution
and general di&s;tre&s;s, that this ex|hortation
is needful. We mu&s;t in every

&s;tate of &s;ociety reckon upon meeting with
unrea&s;onable men, and encountering their
bad u&s;age. This is one of the evils in&s;e|parable
from our pre&s;ent &s;tate. No &s;tation
is &s;o high, no worth &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed, no
innocence &s;o inoffen&s;ive, as to &s;ecure us
entirely again&s;t it. Sometimes the violence
of enemies, &s;ometimes the ingratitude of
friends, will ruffle our &s;pirits. Where we
think that we have merited prai&s;e, we will
be in hazard of meeting reproach. Envy
will ri&s;e unprovoked; and calumny, from its
&s;ecret place, will dart its envenomed &s;hafts
again&s;t the mo&s;t de&s;erving. Such is the
con&s;equence of the pre&s;ent depravity of
our nature, and of the di&s;ordered &s;tate in
which human affairs lie.&mdash;The fondne&s;s
of &s;elf-love is always apt to amu&s;e us with
too flattering pro&s;pects of what life is to
produce for us, beyond what it produces
for others. Hence our impatience and
irritation upon every injury we &s;uffer; as
if &s;ome new and unheard-of thing had
befallen us; and as if we alone were pri|vileged
to pa&s;s through the world, un|touched
<PB N="250" REF="261">
touched by any wrong. Whereas, if we
were di&s;ciplined to think of the world, and
of the tempers of tho&s;e around us, as a wi&s;e
man ought to think, the edge of this im|patience
would be taken off. When we
engage in any undertaking, we ought to
&s;ay to our&s;elves, that in the cour&s;e of it we
will have to do, more or le&s;s, with &s;elfi&s;h,
cra&s;ty, unprincipled men. The&s;e men
will naturally act as their evil nature
prompts them. They are the thorns and
brambles that we mu&s;t expect to encumber
and to gall us in many of the paths of life.
We mu&s;t not hope to <HI>reap grapes of thorns,
nor figs of thi&s;tles.</HI> Wild dogs will naturally
bark; and bea&s;ts of prey naturally &s;eek to
devour.</P>
<P>Now, when thus &s;ituated, how are we to
act for overcoming the evils we have al|ready
endured, or are in hazard of &s;till
farther enduring from others? To provide
for &s;afety and defence, is unque&s;tionably al|lowable
and wi&s;e. But are we al&s;o to lay
plans for future revenge?&mdash;Were this the
cour&s;e to be followed, what would the
<PB N="251" REF="262">
con&s;equence be, but to render the life of
man a &s;tate of con&s;tant ho&s;tility, where
provocations and re&s;entments, injuries and
retaliations, would &s;ucceed one another
without end; till the world became like
a den of wild bea&s;ts, perpetually attack|ing
and devouring one another? No,
&s;ays the Apo&s;tle, <HI>overcome evil with good.</HI>
Di&s;arm and overcome your enemies, by
forgivene&s;s and genero&s;ity. This is the
principle of <HI>good,</HI> which you are to oppo&s;e
to their <HI>evil.</HI> Teach them thereby, if not
to love, at lea&s;t to honour and re&s;pect
you. While you take proper precau|tions
for pre&s;ent &s;afety, provide for the
future, not by &s;tudied plans of revenge,
but by fortitude of mind, by prudent be|haviour,
and &s;uperiour virtue. Herein you
&s;how no unmanly tamene&s;s or coward|ice.
Religion means not to &s;uppre&s;s the
proper &s;eelings of honour, nor the &s;en&s;e
which every man ought to have of dig|nity
of character, and the rights which
belong to him. The&s;e may be &s;upported
to the full, without a mean thir&s;t for re|venge,
<PB N="252" REF="263">
and a fierce de&s;ire of returning evil
for evil.</P>
<P>By the magnanimity of forgivene&s;s, you
gain an important victory in overcoming,
not perhaps your enemy, but your own
wrathful and violent pa&s;&s;ions. Whereas
he, who in &s;uch conjunctures knows no
other method of proceeding but that of
gratifying re&s;entment, is, in truth, the per|&s;on
who is overcome. For he has put it
in the power of his enemy to overthrow
his repo&s;e, and to gall and embitter his
mind. By forgiving and de&s;pi&s;ing injuries,
you a&s;&s;ume a &s;uperiority over your adver|&s;ary,
which he will be obliged to feel.
Whereas, if you allow his provocations to
blow you up into fierce revenge, you have
given him the advantage. You confe&s;s
your&s;elf hurt and fore. His evil has over|come
your good. He has fixed a dart
within you, which in vain you endeavour
to pull out; and by the attempts you
make, you only exa&s;perate and inflame
the &s;ore. Seldom is there any puni&s;hment
which revenge can inflict, more &s;evere than
<PB N="253" REF="264">
is &s;uffered by him who inflicts it. The
bitterne&s;s of &s;pirit, the boilings of fierce
pa&s;&s;ions, joined with all the black ideas
which the cruel plans of revenge excite,
produce more acute &s;en&s;ations of torment,
than any that are occa&s;ioned by bodily
pain.&mdash;When bad men have behaved
injuriou&s;ly towards us, let us leave them
to them&s;elves, and they will be &s;ufficiently
puni&s;hed by their own vices. Their
wickedne&s;s is no rea&s;on why we &s;hould
render our&s;elves unhappy, or afford them
the gratification of having it in their power
to deprive us of peace.&mdash;I &s;hall only add
farther on this head, that a pa&s;&s;ion for
revenge has been always held to be the
characteri&s;tic of a little and mean mind.
Never was any man di&s;tingui&s;hed as a hero,
or recorded in the annals of hi&s;tory as a
great man, to whom this quality of gene|rous
forgivene&s;s of evil did not con&s;pi|cuou&s;ly
belong. We know how eminently
it &s;hone in the character of Him whom
we ju&s;tly venerate as the model of all
perfection; who&s;e dying breath was em|ployed
<PB N="254" REF="265">
in apologi&s;ing and praying for tho&s;e
who were &s;hedding his blood.</P>
<P>II. BE not overcome by the misfortunes
of life, &s;o as to &s;ink into de&s;pair. This is
another view of that <HI>evil</HI> which we are
called upon to <HI>overcome by good;</HI> and is the
&s;en&s;e in which <HI>evil</HI> is mo&s;t generally un|der&s;tood,
and is mo&s;t dreaded by men.
Although by inoffen&s;ive and blamele&s;s be|haviour
we &s;hould e&s;cape, in a great degree,
from the injuries of bad men; yet, to e&s;cape
altogether from the &s;troke of misfortune
and di&s;tre&s;s, is what none of us can expect.
In one way or other, in our per&s;on, or
fortune, or families and friends, it is the
doom of all, more or le&s;s, to &s;uffer. From
what cau&s;es this appointment of Providence
ari&s;es, and to what purpo&s;es it is rendered
&s;ub&s;ervient, it belongs not to our &s;ubject
at pre&s;ent to inquire; the fact is too cer|tain
and obvious.&mdash;The principle of
good which we mu&s;t oppo&s;e to tho&s;e evils
of our lot, and by means of which we may
hope to overcome them, is inward forti|tude,
<PB N="255" REF="266">
grounded on religion and tru&s;t in
God; forming that &s;tate of mind, which,
re&s;ting on it&s;elf, and the witne&s;s of a good
con&s;cience, ri&s;es &s;uperiour to the trials of
the world.</P>
<P>When the &s;ky begins to lour around
thee; when thy gay pro&s;pects begin to
di&s;appear, thy friends to fail, or thy for|tune
to decline; or when, as years ad|vance,
the chief comforts on which thy
heart was &s;et, and on which thou had&s;t
conceived thy happine&s;s to depend, are
unexpectedly cut off; &s;ay not then within
thy&s;elf, &startq;The evil time has now over|taken
me; the gates of hope are all
&s;hut; the days are come wherein I &s;hall
have no plea&s;ure; enjoyment is fled;
nothing remains for me now, but to
clo&s;e my days in melancholy, to de&s;pair,
and to die.&endq;&mdash;This is to be <HI>overcome of
evil</HI> indeed. He who thus allows him&s;elf
to &s;ink under the misfortunes of life, di&s;|honours
the character of a man, &s;till more
that of a chri&s;tian. He &s;hows that what|ever
plau&s;ible appearances he may at former
<PB N="256" REF="267">
times have made before the world, at
bottom he not only wanted &s;trength and
firmne&s;s of mind, but was deficient al&s;o in
religious faith and principle. For it is
impo&s;&s;ible that he who allows him&s;elf to
be &s;o entirely overcome by the evils of the
world, can entertain ju&s;t notions of God,
and of his government of the world. He
hath ca&s;t a&s;ide all reliance on Providence,
and &s;et at nought the promi&s;es of the
go&s;pel. He may &s;uppre&s;s all outward ex|pre&s;&s;ions
of impious di&s;content; he may
even affect the language of re&s;ignation;
but his heart in &s;ecret will murmur and
repine again&s;t the Lord.</P>
<P>The&s;e, therefore, are the occa&s;ions when
it particularly behoves us to call to mind
all tho&s;e principles which &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t us
&s;o to po&s;&s;e&s;s our minds in patience, as to
overcome evil with good.&mdash;Recall, my
brethren, all the former experience you
have had of the goodne&s;s of the Almighty,
and the ground which this affords for tru&s;t
and hope in him now. Recall to remem|brance
all the promi&s;es he has made to
<PB N="257" REF="268">
good men; as the words of Him <HI>who
changes not;</HI> who <HI>is not a man that he &s;hould
lie, nor the &s;on of man that he &s;hould repent.</HI>
Recollect the general tenour of that Pro|vidence,
who&s;e cour&s;e it has ever been, &s;ince
the creation of the world, &s;o to chequer
the life of men with unfore&s;een vici&s;&s;itudes,
as often to make unexpected goods &s;uc|ceed
evils; nay, to make them &s;pring from
evils. Recollect, that whatever fortune
may rob you of, it cannot take away what
is mo&s;t valuable, the peace of a good con|&s;cience,
the plea&s;ing &s;en&s;e of having acted
honourably and done your duty, and the
cheering pro&s;pect of a happy conclu&s;ion to
all the trials of life in a better world. Con|&s;ider,
that as long as virtue remains, there
are always, even in the mo&s;t unfavourable
&s;ituations, &s;ome comforts &s;till left open,
did we not overlook them. For it is &s;eldom
or never that all good things for&s;ake a
man at once, and all evils overtake him
together. If he is bereaved of &s;ome friends
whom he tenderly loved, there are others
yet remaining to whom he may look for
<PB N="258" REF="269">
comfort. If, by infirmity, or old age, he
be excluded from the enjoyments of active
life, the gratifications which lei&s;ure and
repo&s;e afford, are &s;till left to him. If his
fortune be &s;hattered, and poverty threaten
to be&s;et him, yet, even in very &s;traitened
circum&s;tances, many of the &s;imple and be&s;t
plea&s;ures of nature, and many of the &s;atis|factions
of &s;ocial life, can &s;till be enjoyed.
Nay, the mind of a good man can &s;till be
a kingdom to it&s;elf; and though confined
in a pri&s;on, or &s;tretched on a &s;ick-bed, peace|ful
and plea&s;ing thoughts will occa&s;ionally
ari&s;e to him, and fair pro&s;pects of futurity
will pre&s;ent them&s;elves to his view.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;uch con&s;iderations as the&s;e,
let us enliven faith, &s;trengthen patience, and
animate hope, till we be enabled to <HI>over|come
evil with good:</HI> always looking for|ward
to better days; nouri&s;hing tru&s;t in the
gracious government of the univer&s;e; and
li&s;tening to Him who hath &s;aid of old, and
who &s;till &s;ays to all his &s;ervants, <HI>Fear not,
for I am with thee; be not afraid for I am
thy God. Call upon me in the day of trouble,
<PB N="259" REF="270">
and I will an&s;wer thee; wait on the Lord,
be of good courage; and he &s;hall &s;trengthen
your hearts, all ye that wait upon the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>III. BE not overcome by the evil ex|amples
of the world, &s;o as to follow them
into &s;in. This undoubtedly is one of the
mo&s;t dangerous evils which good men are
called to overcome; and where it is mo&s;t
difficult to gain the victory. He who, in
the former in&s;tances that have been men|tioned,
can <HI>overcome evil with good;</HI> who
can generou&s;ly forgive injuries, and mag|nanimou&s;ly
bear up under misfortunes,
will be often in hazard of being overcome
by evil, under this form. After having
maintained his ground again&s;t many a
rough bla&s;t, he may be in danger of being
betrayed by a flattering gale, in the days
of his ea&s;e and pro&s;perity; of being in&s;en|&s;ibly
carried down the &s;tream by that mul|&s;itude
of evil-doers who &s;urround and de|ceive
him. For the character of <HI>the world</HI>
too certainly is, that it <HI>lieth in wickedne&s;s.</HI>
Fa&s;hions of vice may change with the
<PB N="260" REF="271">
times. In one age, one &s;et of corrupt ha|bits
may prevail; and in another, the pa&s;|&s;ions
of men may take a different turn.
But, in every age, the multitude of men
will be prone to indulge vicious de&s;ires.
On the &s;urface of behaviour, vice may be
di&s;gui&s;ed under a plau&s;ible and poli&s;hed ap|pearance,
while at bottom there lies the
poi&s;oned root of evil. Plea&s;ure will ever
captivate the young and unthinking.
Riches and advancement en&s;nare the more
&s;ober and &s;tayed. Attached to their dif|ferent
pur&s;uits, and connecting with them
the ideas of wi&s;dom and importance, the
multitude will ridicule tho&s;e who go not
along with them, as formal and preci&s;e,
as raw, uneducated, and ignorant of the
world. A&s;&s;ailed by &s;uch reproaches, the
timid become afraid; the mode&s;t are
aba&s;hed; the complai&s;ant and good-natured
&s;ubmit to their &s;uppo&s;ed friends. They
begin to imagine that the general opinion
of the world cannot but have &s;ome rea&s;on
on its &s;ide; and, half &s;educed by per&s;ua&s;ion,
half compelled by ridicule, they &s;urrender
<PB N="261" REF="272">
their former convictions, and con&s;ent to
live as they &s;ee others around them living.</P>
<P>Such are the evils which we mu&s;t &s;tudy
to overcome by good, if we wi&s;h to be
e&s;teemed either honourable men, or faithful
chri&s;tians. And how are we to overcome
them? <HI>This is the victory,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle
John, <HI>that overcometh the world, even our
faith</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">1 John, v. 4.</NOTE>. It is the &s;teadine&s;s of firm and
rooted principle, of belief in God and
Chri&s;t, of belief in the everla&s;ting import|ance
of religion and virtue, which you are
to oppo&s;e to the ho&s;t of evil-doers.&mdash;
Con&s;ider, I be&s;eech you, that no fa&s;hions
nor opinions of men can affect that unalter|able
law of God, which re&s;ts on the eternal
ba&s;is of rectitude and truth. Men, if they
plea&s;e, may call evil, good, and good, evil;
but as they cannot change the nature of
things, their voice gives no &s;anction to any
plan of conduct as right and wi&s;e<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See this &s;ubject fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in Sermon XIX. of
Vol. iv.</NOTE>. So far
are you from having any chance of hold|ing
<PB N="262" REF="273">
either a wi&s;e or a &s;afe cour&s;e by going
along with the multitude, that he who
implicitly follows them may be ju&s;tly
pre&s;umed to be in the path of error and
of danger. For in every age the multitude
have enquired &s;uperficially, have judged
ra&s;hly, and acted incon&s;iderately. Con|currence
with general practice, neither af|fords
ju&s;tification of conduct, nor promi&s;es
impunity in what is evil. The Righteous
Lord of all will never &s;uffer his laws to be
&s;ubjected to the capricious fancies of his
creatures. Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors will neither be
&s;creened by their numbers, nor e&s;cape by
being hidden in a crowd.</P>
<P>In times, therefore, when corruption is
prevalent, when vice under any of its modes
is fa&s;hionable, we are particularly called
upon to &s;how that we have within us a
<HI>good,</HI> which we can oppo&s;e to this <HI>evil;</HI> to
&s;how that we have fixed principles of our
own, which we will &s;urrender to no man,
but upon which we will act, and will
&s;tand by them to the la&s;t. It ought to be
no part of our character, that we &s;eek to
<PB N="263" REF="274">
di&s;tingui&s;h our&s;elves by affected au&s;terity,
and a marked &s;ingularity in frivolous
and in&s;ignificant matters. Our di&s;tinc|tion
mu&s;t re&s;t upon a &s;teady adhe|rence
to rational religion and the uncon|trovertible
rules of virtue, when the mul|titude
around us, whether the high or the
low, are deviating into licentious and cri|minal
conduct. Depend upon it you may,
that even that multitude, though they may
attempt to turn you into ridicule, honour
you at the bottom of their hearts. They
will be compelled to acknowledge, or at
lea&s;t to feel, whether they acknowledge it
or not, that your un&s;haken firmne&s;s in what
you e&s;teem to be honourable and worthy,
mu&s;t proceed from &s;ome principle within,
of a higher nature than that from which
they act. At any rate, by thus maintain|ing,
in every &s;ituation, the cau&s;e of religion
and truth, and thereby overcoming evil
with your good, you &s;hall obtain honour
from the great Judge of the earth, and
your reward &s;hall be great in Heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="275">
THUS, in &s;everal important in&s;tances, I
have &s;hown how the exhortation in the
text is to be complied with, and in what
manner our good &s;hould overcome evil;
overcoming injuries by generous forgive|ne&s;s;
overcoming misfortunes by patience
and re&s;ignation; overcoming the tempta|tions
of evil examples by &s;teady adherence
to con&s;cience and duty. In many of the&s;e
ca&s;es, the conflict we are called to maintain
may be ardu$us and difficult; inclined, as
we too often are, by the bent of our nature
to the evil &s;ide. But, if we wi&s;h and de|&s;ire
to do well, let us not be di&s;couraged,
nor de&s;pair of victory. Weak in our|&s;elves,
we have ground to be <HI>&s;trong in
the Lord, and in the power of his might.</HI>
For the principle of good, feeble though
it may be at pre&s;ent in human nature,
is never left unbefriended by God. It is a
principle derived from Heaven, and par|takes
of heavenly efficacy. If it once take

allowed him, for his portion on earth.
He is placed in a world, where, whatever
his rank or &s;tation be, a certain part is
allotted him to act; there are duties
which are required of him; there are &s;e|rious
cares which mu&s;t employ his mind,
how to perform properly the various offices
of life, and to fill up the place which be|longs
to him in &s;ociety.&mdash;He who, laying
a&s;ide all thoughts and cares of this kind,
finding him&s;elf in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of ea&s;y or
a&s;&s;luent fortune, and in the bloom of life,
<PB N="269" REF="280">
&s;ays within him&s;elf, &startq;What have I to do,
but to &s;eek out every plea&s;ure and amu&s;e|ment
which the world can afford me?
Let others toil in the common walks of
life, who have to make their fortunes by
&s;ober and dull application. But to me
labour is &s;uperfluous, the world is open.
Wherever amu&s;ement invites, or plea&s;ure
calls, there I go. By pa&s;&s;ing my days
and nights in whatever can entertain
my fancy or gratify my &s;en&s;es, life &s;hall,
to me, be rendered delightful.&endq;&mdash;He, I
&s;ay, who thinks thus, vainly endeavours to
counteract the intention of nature, and the
decree of Providence. He attempts to
render his &s;tate on earth, what it was never
de&s;igned to be. He might as well expect
that the phy&s;ical laws of nature &s;hould be
altered on his account; and that, in&s;tead of
being confined to walk like ordinary men
on the ground, he &s;hould obtain the pri|vilege
of treading on the air, as expect to
enjoy a &s;tate of perpetual plea&s;ure, by de|voting
him&s;elf to plea&s;ure wholly, and &s;et|ting
a&s;ide all the &s;erious cares and duties
<PB N="270" REF="281">
of life. Troubles, he may be well a&s;&s;ured,
are prepared for him, and await him.
Where he expected &s;atisfaction, he &s;hall
meet with di&s;appointment; and in him
&s;hall be verified the &s;aying in the text,
that <HI>even in laughter the heart is &s;orrowful,
and the end of that mirth is heavine&s;s.</HI>&mdash;
But le&s;t, to per&s;ons of this de&s;cription, &s;uch
general rea&s;oning, from the e&s;tabli&s;hed con|&s;titution
of Providence, may not be &s;atis|factory,
I proceed to &s;how them how clearly
it is confirmed by facts. For this purpo&s;e
let us ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, the obvious con&s;e|quences
of a life of plea&s;ure and di&s;&s;ipation,
to health, fortune, and character. To each
of the&s;e, it is an enemy, preci&s;ely according
to the degree to which it is carried.&mdash;
Character is &s;oon affected by it. As the
man of di&s;&s;ipation often makes his appear|ance
in public, his cour&s;e is marked, and
his character is quickly decided by general
opinion, according to the line which he is
ob&s;erved to pur&s;ue. By frivolity and levity,
<PB N="271" REF="282">
he dwindles into in&s;ignificance. By vicious
exce&s;&s;es, or criminal plea&s;ures, he incurs di&s;|approbation
or contempt. The fair pro&s;pects
which his friends had once entertained of
him die away, in proportion as his idlene&s;s
or extravagance grows; and the only hope
which remains is, that &s;ome fortunate in|cident
may occur to check his career, and
reclaim him to a better mind. In the
mean time, the re&s;pectable and the grave
&s;mile at his follies, and avoid his company.
In the mid&s;t of &s;ome fa&s;hionable a&s;&s;emblies
he may &s;hine; by &s;ome of his fellows he
may be admired; but in the world he is
of no &s;ignificance or con&s;equence, any
more than the little animals that &s;port
around him.&mdash;Health, the mo&s;t valuable
of all temporal ble&s;&s;ings, is known to be
pre&s;erved by temperance and a regular
life. But by the men of di&s;&s;ipation, it is
readily &s;acrificed at the &s;hrine of plea&s;ure.
To years of health and &s;oundne&s;s, they are
often &s;o fooli&s;h as to prefer a few hours
of &s;en&s;ual gratification. Suppo&s;ing that no
extravagant exce&s;&s;es, or vicious plea&s;ures,
<PB N="272" REF="283">
cut &s;hort their health and life, yet what
con&s;titution can &s;tand the irregular hours,
the di&s;orderly living, the carele&s;s indul|gence,
into which the love of plea&s;ure
draws tho&s;e who devote them&s;elves to it?
Hence the &s;hattered and debilitated body,
and the premature old age. The native
vigour and &s;prightline&s;s of youth, is melted
down by effeminacy and &s;en&s;uality. The
&s;pirits are weakened and enervated, if not
&s;unk and lo&s;t for ever.&mdash;The &s;tate of
their fortune may, for a while, enable
them to indulge their plea&s;ures, and to
maintain the figure they wi&s;h to keep up
in the world; but let fortune be ever &s;o
affluent, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch per&s;ons,
it is in the high road to decay. For to
them, attention to bu&s;ine&s;s, or to the ma|nagement
of their affairs, becomes a burden,
which they &s;tudiou&s;ly &s;hun. Prudent oeco|nomy
is di&s;dained, as a mean attention,
belonging only to vulgar and narrow
minds. Their habits of licentioufne&s;s re|quire
unlimited indulgence. The demands
of pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be immediately &s;upplied,
<PB N="273" REF="284">
whatever the con&s;equences be. Hence de|livering
them&s;elves up to tho&s;e who can fur|ni&s;h
&s;upply for their expence, or who pretend
to take charge of their affairs, they become
the prey of the crafty, who fatten on their
&s;poils: till at la&s;t, in the mid&s;t of thoughtle&s;s
extravagance, and of general wa&s;te and
&s;u&s;ion, they &s;ee nothing remaining to them,
but the ruins of a broken fortune.</P>
<P>Such are &s;ome of the mi&s;eries attending
habits of di&s;&s;ipation, and the intemperate love
of plea&s;ure. We &s;ee them daily exemplified
in the world, throughout all the &s;tages
of this character, from the frivolous and
the giddy, up to the rake and the profligate;
in &s;ome &s;tages, only impairing health and
fortune; in others, entirely overthrowing
them; in their beginnings, ca&s;ting a &s;hade on
the characters of men; in their completion,
expo&s;ing them to di&s;grace and mi&s;ery.&mdash;
Even ab&s;tracting from tho&s;e ultimate con|&s;equences
in which irregular plea&s;ures ter|minate,
the gratification which, in the mean
time, they be&s;tow, is dearly paid for. A
temporary &s;atisfaction, it is admitted, they
<PB N="274" REF="285">
afford. They rai&s;e the &s;pirits to a degree
of elevation above their u&s;ual tone, but in
that forced elevation they can never long
remain; and in proportion to the elevation
to which they were rai&s;ed, is the degree of
depre&s;&s;ion to which they &s;ub&s;ide. Expe|rience
has &s;hown, that no &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure,
except what is regulated by temperance, can
be la&s;ting. Every plea&s;ure that is carried
beyond it, is no more than a momentary
explo&s;ion; a tran&s;ient gu&s;h; a torrent that
comes down impetuou&s;ly, &s;parkling and
foaming in its cour&s;e, but that &s;oon runs
out, and leaves a muddy and polluted
channel. Who knows not the languor and
dejection that follow every exce&s;&s;ive indul|gence
of plea$ure, or a long continuation
of amu&s;ement of any kind? From whom
do we hear &s;uch frequent complaints of
low &s;pirits, as from tho&s;e who &s;pend mo&s;t
of their time in the circles of di&s;&s;ipation
and gaiety, or in the revelry of the world?
To what wretched and pernicious re&s;ources
are they obliged to fly, in order to recruit
their &s;pirits, and re&s;tore &s;ome life to their
<PB N="275" REF="286">
deadened &s;en&s;ations? What melancholy &s;pec|tacles
do they at length exhibit of a worn|out
frame, and an exhau&s;ted mind? So well
founded is the a&s;&s;ertion in the text, that
there is <HI>a mirth, the end of which is heavine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>LET us con&s;ider, in the &s;econd place,
the ruin which a life of plea&s;ure and di&s;&s;i|pation
brings upon the moral &s;tate and
character of men, as well as on their
external condition. This de&s;erves the
more attention, as the pur&s;uit of plea&s;ure
&s;ometimes &s;ets out at the beginning with
a fair and innocent appearance. It pro|mi&s;es
to be&s;tow &s;atisfactions unknown to a
duller race of mortals; and, at the &s;ame
time, to allow virtue and honour to remain.
With a great part of mankind, e&s;pecially
with tho&s;e who are mo&s;t likely to run the
race of plea&s;ure, &s;uch as are well born, and
have been regularly educated, &s;ome attach|ment
to good principles at fir&s;t is found.
They cannot as yet bear the reproach of any
thing that is di&s;honourable or ba&s;e. Re|gard
to their word, genero&s;ity of &s;entiment,
<PB N="276" REF="287">
attachment to their friends, and compa&s;&s;ion
for the unhappy, prevail for a while in
their hearts.&mdash;But, alas! as the love of
plea&s;ure gains ground, with what in&s;idious
&s;teps does it advance towards the abolition
of all virtuous principles? It has been ever
found, that without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of re|flection,
and of &s;erious thought, virtue
cannot long &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the human mind.
But to reflection and &s;erious thoughts, the
men of di&s;&s;ipation are &s;trangers. Ab&s;orbed,
as they are, in the whirlpool of fa&s;hionable
life, and hurried along by a rapid &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
of amu&s;ements, reflection is lo&s;t, and good impre&s;&s;ions gradually decay. No|thing
is regarded but pre&s;ent enjoyment,
and plans of improving on that enjoyment in future. As their ta&s;te, and their ac|quired
habits, carry them into the &s;ociety
of licentious company, they mu&s;t follow the more trained votaries of plea&s;ure who
naturally take the lead. They become a&s;|&s;imilated
to the manners of their loo&s;e a&s;|&s;ociates;
and, without perceiving it them|&s;elves, their whole character by degrees
<PB N="277" REF="288">
is changed. Former re&s;traints are now laid
a&s;ide; and in order to pre&s;erve the rank
of equality with their companions in every
expence, prodigality is the nece&s;&s;ary con|&s;equence.
Prodigality pre&s;ently opens a
way to the wor&s;t vices. They become both
covetous and profu&s;e; profu&s;e in &s;pending,
but covetous to acquire. In order to carry
on the &s;plendour of life, and to indulge
their inclinations to the full, they now &s;ub|mit
to what, at their fir&s;t out&s;et in life, they
would have rejected as mean and ba&s;e.
Now is the creditor defrauded; the tenant
racked and oppre&s;&s;ed; the trade&s;man fru&s;|trated
of the reward of his hone&s;t indu&s;try;
and friends and relations, on whom any
impre&s;&s;ion can be made, are plundered
without mercy.&mdash;In this manner all the
bland and &s;miling appearances which
mirth and gaiety once carried, are tran&s;|formed
into the blacke&s;t &s;hapes of vice;
and from a character originally &s;tamped
only with giddine&s;s and levity, &s;hoots
forth a character compounded of di&s;|hone&s;ty,
inju&s;tice, oppre&s;&s;ion, and cruelty.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="289">
Is there any one who will deny, that the
intemperate pur&s;uit of plea&s;ure leads fre|quently
into all the vices now mentioned,
and that &s;ome of them it carries always in
its train? I &s;hall not dwell on certain
crimes, which none but the mo&s;t atrocious
devotees of plea&s;ure will pretend to ju&s;tify,
though all who partake of that character
make too light of them; &s;uch as, the vio|lation
of the marriage-bed, the &s;eduction
of the innocent, and the introduction of
mi&s;ery into families once happy and flou|ri&s;hing.
The&s;e are crimes that require
the interpo&s;ition of the lawgiver and the
judge, more than the admonition of the
preacher.&mdash;Let us only think for a little of
that reproach of modern times, that gulph
of time and fortune, the pa&s;&s;ion for gaming,
which is &s;o often the refuge of the idle
&s;ons of plea&s;ure, and often al&s;o the la&s;t
re&s;ource of the ruined. To how many
bad pa&s;&s;ions, to how many ba&s;e arts, does
it give ri&s;e? What violent agitations of the
mind, &s;ometimes bur&s;ting into rage and
frenzy, does it occa&s;ion? What a &s;hameful
<PB N="279" REF="290">
traffick of gain does it form among per&s;ons,
whom their rank in life, and their connec|tions
in &s;ociety, ought to have rai&s;ed above
the thoughts of enriching them&s;elves by
&s;uch di&s;honourable means? How many
friend&s;hips has it broken? How many
families has it ruined? In what deadly
cata&s;trophes has it often terminated? The
game&s;ter &s;its down at the fatal table with
eager &s;pirits and mighty hopes. Behold
him when he ri&s;es,&mdash;a wretch, haggard and
forlorn, cur&s;ing his fate, and, from de&s;pair
of retrieving his ruined fortune, driven
perhaps to entertain the horrid thought of
ending his own exi&s;tence!&mdash;Di&s;mi&s;&s;ing
&s;o melancholy a theme, let us,</P>
<P>IN the third place, attend to the di&s;|quieting
&s;en&s;ations which are apt to intrude
upon the men of plea&s;ure, even in the
mid&s;t of their enjoyments. Not only is
the <HI>end of their mirth heavine&s;s,</HI> but <HI>in
laughter,</HI> as it is expre&s;&s;ed in the text, <HI>the
heart is &s;orrowful.</HI> Often is laughter af|fected,
when the heart is galled within.
<PB N="280" REF="291">
A &s;how of mirth is put on to cover &s;ome
&s;ecret di&s;quiet. When you enter into a
gay and fe&s;tive a&s;&s;embly, you behold every
appearance of &s;parkling felicity. Alas!
could you look into the brea&s;ts of this
&s;eemingly happy company, how incon&s;ider|able
would the proportion be found of
tho&s;e who were truly happy! how great
the proportion of tho&s;e who, either in their
minds, were entirely vacant and languid;
or who fled to &s;cenes of gaiety in order to
fly from them&s;elves, from dome&s;tic unea&s;i|ne&s;s,
or corroding cares, and in the tumult
of company and forced mirth, to drown
their &s;orrows!&mdash;At the be&s;t, the fla&s;hes
of joy, which bur&s;t from the di&s;&s;ipated and
carele&s;s, are of a tran&s;ient and broken kind,
interrupted by reflections which they cannot
altogether avoid. For at the bottom of
the hearts of mo&s;t men, even amid&s;t an
irregular life, there lies a &s;ecret feeling of
propriety, a &s;en&s;e of right and wrong in
conduct. This inward &s;en&s;e is frequently
&s;o much borne down by appetites and pa&s;|&s;ions,
as to lo&s;e its power of guiding men
<PB N="281" REF="292">
to what is right, while yet it retains as
much influence as to make them &s;en&s;ible
that they have been doing wrong; that
they have not acted that part in life which
they ought to have acted, and which their
friends, and the world, had a title to ex|pect
from them. Though con&s;cience be
not &s;trong enough to guide, it &s;till has
&s;trength to dart a &s;ting.&mdash;Together with
this con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of ill de&s;ert, there will be
at &s;ome times joined a humbling &s;en&s;e of
their own in&s;ignificancy, when they behold
others meeting with e&s;teem and honour for
having acted a manly and worthy part in
life. Their &s;uperiority they are obliged
to acknowledge, and to look up to them
with re&s;pect; while the retro&s;pect of their
own life affords nothing but &s;hame, and
the bitter remembrance of time they have
mi&s;pent, and opportunities they have
thrown away.&mdash;In the mid&s;t too of mor|tifying
reflections of this kind, it will not
be in their power to e&s;cape altogether from
a dread of certain con&s;equences which are
in hazard of befalling from their carele&s;s
<PB N="282" REF="293">
conduct. Scarcely is any fortune &s;o &s;table
as to be beyond the reach of accidents that
will dimini&s;h it. To none &s;o readily as to
the men of plea&s;ure, are &s;uch accidents likely
to happen; and fond as they are of their
pre&s;ent &s;uperb train of living, the dread
that it may not be in their power always
to continue it, will, in &s;pite of all their en|deavours
to avoid &s;uch thoughts, occa|&s;ionally
force it&s;elf upon them, and ca&s;t a
cloud over many a &s;cene of projected mer|riment.</P>
<P>Can you reckon that to be &s;incere joy,
which is liable to be interrupted and mingled
with &s;o many &s;en&s;ations of the mo&s;t di&s;a|greeable
nature? In the cup of intemper|ance,
or in the tumult of loo&s;e &s;ociety, the
man of plea&s;ure &s;tudies to drown them.
But often his efforts are vain. When he
pu&s;hes to the utmo&s;t his &s;cenes of criminal
revelry, they will carry the re&s;emblance of
Bel&s;hazzar's fea&s;t; at which, while the im|pious
monarch was drinking among&s;t his
lords and concubines, he beheld the fingers
of a man's hand-writing in unknown cha|racters
<PB N="283" REF="294">
on the wall over again&s;t him; <HI>and
his countenance changed, and his heart &s;unk
within him</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Daniel, v. 5.</NOTE>. Thus, in the mid&s;t of riot,
imagined &s;pectres have been known to
haunt the man of guilty plea&s;ure. He &s;ees
hands coming forth to write on the wall
again&s;t him. The very portraits of his
ance&s;tors which hang in his hall, appear to
him to look with frowning a&s;pect, and to
upbraid him with wa&s;ting in licentious
plea&s;ures the fortune which their honour|able
labours or virtuous indu&s;try had ac|quired.
&mdash;Of all the cla&s;&s;es of &s;inners, it has
been found, that none are &s;o liable, in &s;ome
period of their lives, or at lea&s;t when life
is drawing to its clo&s;e, to be &s;mitten with
&s;evere remor&s;e, as tho&s;e who have &s;acri|ficed
to plea&s;ure all the calls of con&s;cience
and of duty.</P>
<P>LET us con&s;ider, in the la&s;t place, how un|&s;uitable
a life of di&s;&s;ipation and plea&s;ure is to
the condition of man in this world, and how
<PB N="284" REF="295">
injurious to the intere&s;ts of &s;ociety. In the
world, we are &s;urrounded with &s;cenes of di&s;|tre&s;s.
We behold the greate&s;t part of the
human race doomed to hard labour and penu|rious
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence. We hear the cries of indi|gence.
We know that every day thou&s;ands
are yielding up their breath, and thou&s;ands
are attending their dying friends. Our own
lives are fleeting fa&s;t away. Flouri&s;hing as
our &s;tate may at pre&s;ent &s;eem, we know
there is but a &s;tep between us and death.
The younge&s;t and the healthie&s;t cannot tell
whether they may not, within the &s;pace of
a few days, be called to undergo the judg|ment
of God.&mdash;Is this a time, is this a
place, where no other thing is to be pur|&s;ued
but giddy amu&s;ement and perpetual
plea&s;ure?&mdash;Have you, my friends, who
are &s;pending your days in this wanton abu&s;e
of pro&s;perity, no &s;en&s;e of the un&s;uitablene&s;s
of &s;uch conduct to the condition of mortal
man? Do you &s;ee nothing in the &s;tate of
human life to cha&s;ten and temper your
mirth; to bring &s;erious reflexions home to
your bo&s;om; to admoni&s;h you that it is
<PB N="285" REF="296">
better to go &s;ometimes <HI>to the hou&s;e of
mourning,</HI> than to dwell always <HI>in the hou&s;e
of fea&s;ting?&mdash;</HI> Do you feel no compunc|tion
at the thought that, by your luxury
and extravagance, you are adding to the
&s;cenes of &s;orrow which already abound in
this afflicted world? For you, and your fol|lies,
the aged parent, or the re&s;pectable re|lation,
mourn. To &s;upply the oppre&s;&s;ive
demands of your plea&s;ures, families are
driven from their habitations, and left to
poverty and want. Your mirth forces the
widow and the fatherle&s;s to weep.&mdash;At
the &s;ame time, you are &s;cattering poi&s;on in
&s;ociety around you. You are corrupting
the public manners by the life which you
lead. You are propagating follies and
vices; and by the example which you &s;et,
are en&s;$aring many to follow you into ruin.
&mdash;Con&s;ider with how much di&s;centent
and indignation the poorer cla&s;&s;es of men,
all the while, behold you. E&s;pecially, if in
times of &s;carcity and of war, &s;uch as tho&s;e
in which I now write, they &s;ee you in|dulging
in wa&s;tefulne&s;s and thoughtle&s;s pro|fu&s;ion,
<PB N="286" REF="297">
when they and their families, are
not able to earn their bread. As long as
wealth is properly employed, per&s;ons in
low &s;ituation naturally look up to their
&s;uperiours with re&s;pect. They re&s;t con|tented
in their &s;tation. They are even
di&s;po&s;ed to ble&s;s the hand which fur|ni&s;hes
them with employment on rea|&s;onable

&s;ea&s;onable relief. But if they feel them|&s;elves
oppre&s;&s;ed merely that a few may
be enabled to &s;quander at plea&s;ure, and
to revel in wa&s;teful exce&s;s, their di&s;contents

work.</P>
<P>SUCH are &s;ome of the con&s;equences
which flow from di&s;&s;ipation and the in|temperate
love of plea&s;ure. Let not the

&s;in within pre&s;cribed bounds, may reckon
with certainty on their bearing a &s;hare of
the evils and mi&s;eries which I have de|&s;cribed.
Not only &s;o, but having once
entered on an irregular cour&s;e, they cannot
tell where they are to &s;top. They have
drunk from the cup of the enchantre&s;s; and
being fairly brought within the magic circle,
their powers of reflection are laid a&s;leep,
and to make an e&s;cape may not be in their
power.</P>
<P>To &s;ome, it may perhaps appear, that
the whole &s;train of this di&s;cour&s;e refers
only to the rich and the great; and that
per&s;ons of moderate fortune, and of the
middle ranks of life, who form the great
body of &s;ociety, have little or no concern
in it. But this is entirely a mi&s;take. Splen|did
fortune, and high birth or rank, afford,
beyond doubt, the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t fre|quent
<PB N="288" REF="299">
temptations to the loo&s;e indulgence
of every enjoyment. But throughout all
ranks the danger extends of being mi&s;led
by plea&s;ure in &s;ome of its forms. In this
country, where wealth and abundance are
&s;o much diffu&s;ed over all &s;tations; where
it is well known that the inferiour orders
of men are perpetually pre&s;&s;ing upon tho&s;e
who are above them, and following them
in their manners, a life of di&s;&s;ipation is
perhaps not le&s;s frequent among the mid|dle
than among the higher cla&s;&s;es of &s;o|ciety.
The modes of amu&s;ement may not
be &s;o refined. The entertainments and
plea&s;ures may be of a gro&s;&s;er kind. But
in many an inferiour circle, there prevails
as much love of pomp and &s;how, as much
proportional extravagance in expence, as
much rivalry in the competition of pa&s;&s;ions
and plea&s;ures, as in the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable and
courtly a&s;&s;emblies. Sober reflections are as
much laid a&s;ide; the gratification of vanity,
and the indulgence of plea&s;ure, are pur|&s;ued
with equal eagerne&s;s.&mdash;Let us there|fore,
my brethren, in whatever rank of
<PB N="289" REF="300">
life we are placed, proceed upon this as
our great principle, that to &s;erve God, to
attend to the &s;erious cares of life, and to
di&s;charge faithfully the duties of our &s;tation,
ought to be the fir&s;t concern of every man
who wi&s;hes to be wi&s;e and happy; that
amu&s;ement and plea&s;ure are to be con|&s;idered
as the relaxation, not the bu&s;ine&s;s, of
life; and that if from tho&s;e &s;entiments we
depart, and give our&s;elves up to plea&s;ure as
our only object, <HI>even in laughter the heart
&s;hall be &s;orrowful, and the end of our mirth
&s;hall be heavine&s;s.</HI></P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>ACTS, xxiv. 16.</BIBL>
<Q>Herein do I exerci&s;e my&s;elf, to have always
a con&s;cience void of offence toward God
and toward men.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE words were &s;poken by the
Apo&s;tle Paul,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XIII.</NOTE> in the cour&s;e of that
manly and &s;pirited defence which he made
for him&s;elf, when accu&s;ed of &s;edition and
impiety before Felix, the Roman Gover|nour.
He vindicates him&s;elf from the
charges brought again&s;t him; but boldly
avows his principles, conceals no part he
had acted, gives up no doctrine he had
<PB N="291" REF="302">
taught, and, with the firm con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of
innocence, appeals to his enemies them|&s;elves
for the unblemi&s;hed integrity of his
life and character.</P>
<P>To maintain <HI>always a con&s;cience void of
offence toward God and toward men,</HI> is a
degree of virtue, to which, in its full extent,
none can lay claim. For who is there
among the &s;ons of men that can pretend,
on every occa&s;ion, throughout his whole
life, to have pre&s;erved a faultle&s;s conduct?
How few days, indeed, go over our heads
wherein &s;omething does not pa&s;s, in which
our behaviour has not been altogether cor|rect,
or free from every offence? In the
pre&s;ent imbecility and fallen &s;tate of human
nature, he is the worthie&s;t per&s;on who is
guilty of the fewe&s;t offences towards God
or towards man. But though the character
referred to in the text be not attainable
by us in a complete degree, it is the cha|racter
to which we mu&s;t all &s;tudy to ap|proach;
to come as near to it as the weak|ne&s;s
of our nature admits; &s;o that neither
in piety towards God, nor in &s;ocial duties
<PB N="292" REF="303">
towards men, we may be found remarkably
de&s;icient.&mdash;You will ob&s;erve, that this
great Apo&s;tle does not boa&s;t of having
fully attained to a con&s;cience void of every
offence. His words are, that <HI>herein he
exerci&s;ed him&s;elf;</HI> that is, this was his object
and his &s;tudy, to this he formed and trained
him&s;elf, to have <HI>always a con&s;cience void
of offence towards God and men.</HI>&mdash;A&s;|&s;uredly,
there is nothing in human life
more amiable and re&s;pectable than &s;uch a
character. Wherever it appears, it com|mands
univer&s;al reverence in every &s;tation,
whether high or low. It is indeed what
all men would wi&s;h to gain; at lea&s;t, they
wi&s;h that others &s;hould believe them to
po&s;&s;e&s;s it. Even the mo&s;t corrupted look
to it, from afar, with a &s;igh; and however
obliged to condemn them&s;elves for having
fallen &s;hort of it, cannot help e&s;teeming
and re&s;pecting others who are dignified by
the attainment of it.&mdash;Let us then con|&s;ider,
fi$&s;t, what is implied in <HI>exerci&s;ing</HI>
or forming our&s;elves to maintain the con|&s;cience
void of offence; and next, what the
<PB N="293" REF="304">
effects will be of having, in &s;ome degree,
attained it.</P>
<P>I. IN <HI>exerci&s;ing</HI> our&s;elves for this purpo&s;e,
our fir&s;t care mu&s;t be to have our con&s;cience
well informed, or properly in&s;tructed, as to
what is, or is not, real ground of offence to|wards
God or towards men. Con&s;cience is
the guide, or the enlightening and directing
principle of conduct; and as our Saviour
has warned us, <HI>If the light which is in thee
be darkne&s;s, how great will that darkne&s;s
be?</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Matth. vi. 23.</NOTE>? If that which &s;hould guide us be
it&s;elf mi&s;led, how widely mu&s;t we wander
a&s;tray?&mdash;There are two extremes here, to
each of which, different &s;ets of men are
apt erroneou&s;ly to incline. One &s;et of men
are apt to be minutely &s;erupulous about
matters of &s;maller importance; <HI>tithing,</HI> as
the Scripture de&s;cribes them, <HI>mint, ani&s;e,
and cumin, while they neglect the weightier
matters of the law.</HI> Punctual in their ob|&s;ervance
of all the forms and ceremonies
<PB N="294" REF="305">
of religion, they hope by this means to
compen&s;ate for allowing them&s;elves in
unlawful plea&s;ures or unrighteous gains.
Another, and perhaps a more numerous
&s;et of men, err from loo&s;e ca&s;ui&s;try in
matters of moral duty. They admit the
obligation they are under to virtuous prac|tice;
but they lay the whole &s;tre&s;s of virtue
on &s;ome particular good di&s;po&s;itions to
which their temper inclines them. On
the&s;e they highly value them&s;elves; but
breaches of other parts of duty, they are
apt to con&s;ider as &s;mall and venial tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions.
They have balances of their
own, in which they weigh every tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion;
and if any of the offences they
have committed, either again&s;t God or their
neighbour, weigh light in the &s;cale of
fa&s;hion or general practice, they appear to
them as &s;carcely any offences at all.&mdash;Both
the&s;e extremes we mu&s;t carefully guard
again&s;t; and &s;tudy to regulate our conduct
by the pure un&s;ophi&s;ticated laws of God;
re&s;ting our character neither on a &s;trict
ob&s;ervance merely of the external forms of
<PB N="295" REF="306">
religion, nor on a partial regard to its moral
duties; but attending to all that God has
required from us as men and Chri&s;tians.&mdash;
The truth is, &s;uch errors as I have pointed
out, always have their &s;ource in &s;ome corrup|tion
of the heart. It is not from inability
to di&s;cover what they ought to do, that men
err in practice. It is from &s;ome oblique
regard to their intere&s;ts or their plea&s;ures,
to their reputation or their gain, that they
deviate into by-paths, while they affect to
a&s;&s;ume &s;ome appearance of principle. Fair|ne&s;s
and uprightne&s;s of mind are the chief
requi&s;ites for directing our con&s;cience how
to avoid offences towards God or man.
He who, with an hone&s;t intention, &s;eeks
in every ca&s;e to know what it is his duty
to do, will &s;eldom or never be at a lo&s;s to
di&s;cover it.</P>
<P>IN the next place, it belongs to every one
who &s;tudies to attain to a con&s;cience void
of offence, to make reparation for whatever
wrong he is con&s;cious of having formerly
done. This is the mo&s;t difficult, but at
<PB N="296" REF="307">
the &s;ame time the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory te&s;t,
of our &s;incerity in de&s;iring to have a clear
con&s;cience before God and man. How
can he be &s;incere in this de&s;ire, who allows
him&s;elf to remain quiet, while loaded with
the &s;en&s;e that all he $ow enjoys has been
obtained by inju&s;t $word$ fraud? If he con|tinues,
without remor&s;e, to fatten upon the
gains of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s; to fea&s;t on the
&s;poils of the indu&s;trious; to revel in luxu|ries
purcha&s;ed by oppre&s;&s;ion or treachery;
dare he hold up his face, and utter the
name of Con&s;cience? <HI>Woe to $im that build|eth
his hou&s;e in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, and his
chambers by wrong</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Jerem. xxii. 13.</NOTE>. In the mid&s;t of his
&s;tately habitation, <HI>the &s;tone,</HI> in the expre&s;&s;ive
language of Scripture, <HI>&s;hall cry out of the
wall again&s;t him; and the beam out of the
timber &s;hall an&s;wer it</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">$$bak ii. 11.</NOTE>.&mdash;It may not be
always in a man's power to make exact
re&s;titution of every unlawful gain he has
acquired; but to make reparation to the
utmo&s;t of his power, for every wrong $e
<PB N="297" REF="308">
has done to others, is the duty of every
one who lays any claim to principle or
hone&s;ty. If this be entirely neglected, it
is the mark of a con&s;cience that is become
dead to all &s;en&s;e of right and wrong. In
vain we pretend t$ clear our con&s;cience,
by affecting to co$$$&s;ate for fraud or
cruelty, either by acts of &s;trict religious
homage towards God, or by &s;ome partial
virtues and &s;hows of genero&s;ity towards
men. With re&s;pect to men, we ought to
learn that we mu&s;t begin with being ju&s;t,
before we can attempt to be generous.
With re&s;pect to God, we know that he
delights in <HI>mercy more than &s;acrifice;</HI> and
rejects with contempt the hypocritical
wor&s;hipper. <HI>I will come near to you in
judgment, faith the Lord; and I will be a
&s;wift witne&s;s again&s;t tho&s;e that oppre&s;s the
$ireling, the widow, and the &s;atherle&s;s; and
that turn a&s;ide the &s;tranger from his right.&mdash;
The Lord will plead their cau&s;e, and &s;poil
the &s;oul of tho&s;e that &s;poiled them</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Malachi, iii. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="309">
AFTER making reparation for the wrongs
he has committed, the next &s;tudy of every
one who is <HI>exerci&s;ing him&s;elf to have the
con&s;cience void of offence,</HI> &s;hould be to
guard again&s;t tho&s;e particular &s;nares which
have formerly led him into evil.&mdash;If, for
in&s;tance, covetou&s;ne&s;s has on many oc|ca&s;ions
tempted him to defraud or oppre&s;s,
that he might increa&s;e his worldly &s;tore,
it ought to be his fir&s;t care to correct in
future this inordinate pa&s;&s;ion for wealth,
by bringing down in his e&s;timation the
acqui&s;itions of fortune to their proper
value; &s;o that he may remain &s;atisfied with
a moderate &s;hare of the world's goods, and
become &s;en&s;ible of what &s;mall importance
great riches are to real happine&s;s. If am|bition
has impelled him to ri&s;e into con|&s;ideration
by crooked policy and intrigues,
let him impre&s;s his mind with all the con|&s;iderations
that will &s;how him the emptine&s;s
and vanity of worldly honours. If a loo&s;e
and carele&s;s life has brought him into
habits of di&s;&s;ipation, and led him to neglect
tho&s;e religious duties which he owed to
<PB N="299" REF="310">
his Maker, let him return to the regular
wor&s;hip of God; and nouri&s;h an awful
fear and reverence of that Almighty Being,
on whom his all depends in time and eter|nity.
&mdash;In this manner it mu&s;t be his
care to begin, by eradicating tho&s;e cor|ruptions
which, on different occa&s;ions, have
tempted him to violate con&s;cience. This
&s;tudy to reform all known errors in former
life, will be one of the mo&s;t &s;atisfying marks
of a &s;incere de&s;ign to pre&s;erve in future a
con&s;cience void of offence. For if any of
the old vitiated parts of the di&s;po&s;ition be
allowed to remain in their former &s;tate,
in vain will any man apply him&s;elf to a
thorough reformation of character. The
favourite ruling pa&s;&s;ion, if it be &s;uffered to
keep its a&s;cendant, will not fail to drag the
life after it.</P>
<P>IN the la&s;t place, in order to carry on
this di&s;cipline which I have been recom|mending
for obtaining a good con&s;cience,
it will be highly nece&s;&s;ary, that we fre|quently
examine our&s;elves, and bring our
<PB N="300" REF="311">
conduct under review. No day ought to
pa&s;s over our head, without &s;ome exerci&s;e
of this kind. Every evening before we
go to re&s;t, we &s;hould &s;ubject to &s;erutiny
the tran&s;actions in which we have been
engaged. &startq;What have I done this day,
by which I may either have ju&s;tly of|&s;ended
any man, or have &s;hown neglect
of God? What duty have I tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed?
Wherein have I omitted to act the part
which my Maker, or my fellow-creatures,
had a title to expect from me?&endq;&mdash;Be
a&s;&s;ured, my friends, that only by thus pre|&s;erving
con&s;cience in the frequent exerci&s;e
of its natural juri&s;diction, you can &s;upport
its rights. If you do not lead it in this
manner often to a&s;&s;ume its due &s;$ation, its
authority will gradually decline. There
willbe no accuracy in your moral conduct.
Corruptions will grow upon you unawares.
You will forget that you are creatures ac|countable
for your actions, to a higher tri|bunal
than that of the world.&mdash;It is a
carele&s;s train of living, that is the general
ruin of mankind. It is not &s;o much from
<PB N="301" REF="312">
having adopted evil principles that men
become wicked, as from having adopted
no principles at all. They follow their
inclinations, without examining whether
there be any principles which they ought
to form for regulating their conduct. The
chief corrective of this mi&s;chief is that
which has been &s;ugge&s;ted; by bringing
con&s;cience into a frequent exerci&s;e of its
power, and thereby awakening its authority
over our life.&mdash;Bitterly it may at times re|prove
us for our &s;ins and follies. Sharply
it may &s;ting. But tho&s;e reproofs and tho&s;e
&s;tings are &s;alutary in their effect; and
tend to prevent us from proceeding head|long
in a downward cour&s;e. If ever con|&s;cience
become altogether dead and &s;till,
the &s;ymptom is ominous of our having
contracted from hardened vice that mortal
lethargy, from which we are only to be
awakened at the day of judgment.</P>
<P>II. HAVING thus &s;ugge&s;ted &s;ome of the
particulars which appear mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential in
<HI>exerci&s;ing</HI> or forming <HI>our&s;elves to attain to
<PB N="302" REF="313">
a con&s;cience void of offence towards God and
men,</HI> I come next to recommend this di&s;|cipline
by &s;howing the happy effects it will
produce. The&s;e happy effects are mani|fold;
to avoid prolixity, I &s;hall compri&s;e
them under two general heads. Such a
clear con&s;cience &s;ets us free from the ter|rors
of another world; it exempts us from
a multitude of di&s;quietudes in this.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, the con&s;cience void of offence tends
to procure freedom from the terrors of
another world. Many, I know, in the
gaiety of their hearts, pretend to make
light of terrors of this kind; yet nothing
is more certain, than that they are capable
of a&s;&s;ailing and di&s;maying the &s;toute&s;t heart.
Con&s;cience is too great a power in the nature
of man to be altogether &s;ubdued. It may
for a time be repre&s;&s;ed and kept dormant.
But conjunctures there are in human life
which awaken it; and when once awakened,
it fla&s;hes on the &s;inner's mind with all the
horrors of an invi&s;ible Ruler and a future
judgment. It has been &s;o ordered by Pro|vidence,
<PB N="303" REF="314">
that it is always in the evil day,
at the &s;ea&s;on when men &s;tand mo&s;t in
need of con&s;olation and &s;upport, that con|&s;cience
exerts its vengeance on the guilty.
I might mention what is &s;uffered in the
lonely hours of &s;olitude and &s;ilence, when
the &s;inner's mind is humbled and depre&s;&s;ed
by &s;ome recent di&s;grace, or &s;ome di&s;ap|pointment
in his criminal pur&s;uits. But
let me only lead your thoughts to what
mu&s;t await us all, when we &s;hall have ar|rived
at the decline of life; when we feel
the hand of death upon us, and cannot any
more flatter our&s;elves that it will long
delay giving the fatal &s;troke. <HI>Sufficient,</HI>
and more than &s;ufficient, <HI>for that day will
be the evil thereof,</HI> even &s;uppo&s;ing that no|thing
within &s;hall alarm us with dark fore|bodings
of what is to follow. But if at the
time when we are oppre&s;&s;ed with &s;ickne&s;s
or pain upon our bed, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed perhaps
with the &s;ituation of our family and worldly
affairs, and ju&s;t about to take the la&s;t fare|well
of our friends and of all we have
ever loved on earth; if, in the mid&s;t of
<PB N="304" REF="315">
this &s;cene of di&s;tre&s;s, we &s;hall be al&s;o tor|mented
with the thought of what is to
become of us in that next world which is
ju&s;t opening to our view; if we depart
from life, con&s;cious that we de&s;erve puni&s;h|ment
for the manner in which we have
lived; and dreading that the hour of our
being to receive that puni&s;hment is at hand;
&s;uch a &s;tate of complicated mi&s;ery who
can endure? <HI>The &s;pirit thus wounded</HI> and
bleeding, when it is going forth from the
body, <HI>who can bear?</HI></P>
<P>I by no means &s;ay, that he, who during
his life has taken the greate&s;t care to pre|&s;erve
his con&s;cience void of offence, can
upon that plea re&s;t with confidence; or
upon this ground alone leave this life with|out
unea&s;ine&s;s or fear. No man's con|&s;cience
was ever entirely clear from all
reproach. We daily offend; and the be&s;t
have much rea&s;on to implore mercy and
forgivene&s;s from their Judge. The whole
&s;train of the Go&s;pel tends to humble and
depre&s;s tho&s;e who vainly tru&s;t to their own
imperfect righteou&s;ne&s;s. It teaches us that
<PB N="305" REF="316">
the ultimate ground on which we are to
re&s;t for acceptance with God, is the righteou&s;|ne&s;s
and merit of our great Redeemer.&mdash;
But this I &s;ay, and te&s;tify to you, that
the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory evidence you can
po&s;&s;e&s;s, of having an intere&s;t in the Re|deemer's
merits, and being finally accepted
through him, mu&s;t ari&s;e from the te&s;timony
of a con&s;cience, which you have &s;tudied to
keep <HI>void of offence towards God and to|wards
men.</HI> This will be the be&s;t proof
of your belonging to the number of the
&s;ons of God. It will be the witne&s;s of the
divine &s;pirit within you; the day-&s;tar
ari&s;ing in your hearts, and preparing the
approach of a more perfect day.&mdash;Without
the &s;tudy of attaining a good con&s;cience,
be a&s;&s;ured, that all other grounds of hope
will prove fallacious: not the mo&s;t &s;ervent
zeal, nor the highe&s;t pretences to intercour&s;e
with God, will be of any avail. They will
have no more &s;tability than the hou&s;e built
on the &s;and, which, in the day of trial, falls
to the ground. He only who&s;e con&s;cience
bears witne&s;s to his faithfulne&s;s, his integrity,
and &s;incerity, in di&s;charging all the duties
<PB N="306" REF="317">
of life, can, with a &s;teady mind, and a firm
but humble tru&s;t in his Saviour, look for|ward
to all that awaits him in a future
unknown world.</P>
<P>IN the next place, while the con&s;cience
void of offence thus delivers us, in a great
degree, from the terrors of a future life, it
keeps us free, at the &s;ame time, from in|numerable
di&s;quietudes in this life. All
the offences for which con&s;cience condemns
us, become, in one way or other, &s;ources
of vexation. Never did any man long for|&s;ake
the &s;traight and upright path, without
having cau&s;e to repent of it. Whether it
be plea&s;ure, or intere&s;t, or ambition, that
leads him a&s;tray, he is always made to pay
dear for any &s;uppo&s;ed advantage he gains.
Warily and cautiou&s;ly he may at fir&s;t &s;et
out, and lay many re&s;traints on him&s;elf
again&s;t proceeding too far. But having
once for&s;aken con&s;cience as his guide, his
pa&s;&s;ions and inclinations &s;oon take the lead
of his conduct, and pu&s;h him forward
ra&s;hly. One bad &s;tep betrays him into
another; till, in the end, he is overtaken,
<PB N="307" REF="318">
if not by poverty and di&s;ea&s;e, at lea&s;t by
di&s;honour and &s;hame, by the lo&s;s of friends,
and the forfeiture of general e&s;teem. <HI>He
who walketh uprightly,</HI> has been always
&s;ound to <HI>walk &s;urely:</HI> while in the dark
and crooked paths of fraud, di&s;hone&s;ty, or
ignoble plea&s;ure, a thou&s;and forms of trouble
and di&s;a&s;ter ari&s;e to meet us. In the mean
time, to a bad man, con&s;cience will be al|ways
an unea&s;y companion. In the mi$&s;t
of his amu&s;ements, it will &s;requently break
in upon him with reproach. At night,
when he would go to re&s;t, holding up to
him the deeds of the former day, putting
him in mind of what he has lo&s;t and what
he has incurred, it will make him often
a&s;hamed, often afraid.&mdash;Cowardice and
ba&s;ene&s;s of mind are never failing conco|mitants
of a guilty con&s;cience. He who
is haunted by it, dares never &s;tand forth to
the world, and appear in his own character.
He is reduced to be con&s;tantly &s;tudying
concealment, and living in di&s;gui&s;e. He
mu&s;t put on the &s;miling and open look,
when dark de&s;igns are brooding in his
<PB N="308" REF="319">
mind. Con&s;cious of his own bad pur|po&s;es,
he looks with di&s;tru&s;t on all who are
around him, and &s;hrinks from the &s;crutiny
of every piercing eye. He &s;ees, or fancies
that he &s;ees, &s;u&s;picion in many a counte|nance;
and reads upbraiding in looks
where no upbraiding was meant. Often
he <HI>is in great fear, where no &s;ear is.</HI></P>
<P>Very different from this, is the &s;tate of
the man who&s;e con&s;cience is void of offence.
He is manly and intrepid in every &s;itua|tion.
He has never &s;educed the innocent
by guilty arts. He has deluded no one with
fal&s;e promi&s;es. He has en&s;nared no man
to tru&s;t him by a deceitful account of his
affairs; nor taken any advantage of the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es
of others to enrich him&s;elf. With|out
unea&s;ine&s;s he can look every man
boldly in the face; and &s;ay with the good
Prophet Samuel; <HI>Behold, here I am; wit|ne&s;s
again&s;t me. Who&s;e ox have I taken?
or, who&s;e a&s;s have I taken? or, whom
have I defra$ded? Whom have I op|pre&s;&s;ed?
Of who&s;e hand have I received
any bribe? Declare, and I will re&s;tore it to
<PB N="309" REF="320">
you</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">1 Samuel, xii. 3.</NOTE>. He who can thus take God and the
world to witne&s;s for his integrity, may de|&s;pi&s;e
popular accu&s;ation or reproach. Tho&s;e
cen&s;ures and rumours whi$h are con&s;tantly
di&s;quieting the man of guilty con&s;cience,
pa&s;s by him unheeded. <HI>His witne&s;s is in
heaven; and his record is on high.</HI> Inno|cence
and uprightne&s;s form a tenfold &s;hield,
again&s;t which the darts of the world are
aimed in vain. Of neither God as his
Judge, nor of men as his companions, is
&s;uch a man afraid. With no unquiet nor
terrifying &s;lumbers will his couch be
haunted. <HI>I will both lay me down in peace,
and &s;leep; for the Lord maketh me dwell in
&s;afety.</HI></P>
<P>LET tho&s;e con&s;iderations which have
been now briefly &s;ugge&s;ted, contribute to
render the character in the text, <HI>of a con|&s;cience
void of offence towards God and man,</HI>
amiable and e&s;timable in our eyes. If in its
fulle&s;t extent we cannot attain to it, let us
<PB N="310" REF="321">
at lea&s;t endeavour to approach to it, and
herein with the great Apo&s;tle <HI>exerci&s;e our|&s;elves.</HI>
We may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that the more
we partake of this character, the happier
and more honourable &s;hall our life be on
earth, and the nearer &s;hall it bring us to
Heaven. Con&s;cious of our innumerable
frailties, let it be our daily prayer to God,
that by his powerful &s;pirit he would rectify
what is corrupted in our nature; would
guard us by his grace again&s;t the tempta|tions
that &s;urround us; <HI>keep us from the
path of the de&s;troyer, and lead us in his way
everla&s;ting.</HI></P>

<Q>And he led them out as far as to Bethany;
and he lift up his hands and ble&s;&s;ed them:
And it came to pa&s;s while be ble&s;&s;ed them,
he was parted from them and carried up
into Heaven.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE &s;acred Scriptures not only &s;et before
us a complete rule of life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XIV.</NOTE> but give weight
and authority to the precepts they deliver,
by the information they communicate of
certain great and important facts, in which
<PB N="312" REF="323">
all the human race have a deep concern.
Of tho&s;e facts one of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious
is the a&s;cen&s;ion of our Saviour to Heaven,
after having completed the work of our
redemption. This is a &s;ubject on which
it is at all times plea&s;ing to a Chri&s;tian to
meditate; but e&s;pecially after the cele|bration
of that &s;olemn ordinance in which
we were this day engaged. We there re|newed
the memorial of our Saviour &s;uffer|ing
and dying in the cau&s;e of mankind.
Let us now take part in his &s;ucceeding
triumphs. Let us with plea&s;ure behold
him ri&s;ing from the grave, as the conqueror
of death and hell, and a&s;cending into
heaven, there to reign in glory, and to
act as the protector and guardian of his
people, to the end of time.&mdash;It will be
proper to begin with taking a particular
view of all the circum&s;tances that attend|ed
this memorable event in the hi&s;tory
of our Saviour's life; as they are related
in the text, compared with the accounts
of other Evangeli&s;ts. The circum&s;tances
will all be found to be both beautiful
<PB N="313" REF="324">
and &s;ublime in them&s;elves, and in&s;tructive
to us.</P>
<P>WE are informed,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Acts, i. 3.</NOTE> that it was not until
forty days after his re&s;urrection from the
grave, that this event took place. During
this &s;pace he had <HI>&s;hown him&s;elf alive after
his pa&s;&s;ion, by many infallible proofs, being
often &s;een by his di&s;ciples, and conver&s;ing
with them of things pertaining to the king|dom
of God.</HI> All being now concluded
which he had to do on earth; the guilt of
mankind having been expiated by his death,
and his Apo&s;tles fully in&s;tructed in the
part they were henceforth to act, and the
character they were to a&s;&s;ume; one day, we
are told, he <HI>led them out of the city as far as
to Bethany.</HI>&mdash;With the utmo&s;t propriety
was this place &s;elected for the &s;cene of his
a&s;cen&s;ion. Near Bethany was the Mount
of Olives, to which our Lord was wont &s;o
often to retire for the exerci&s;e of private
devotion; and there al&s;o was the garden
<PB N="314" REF="325">
of Geth&s;emane, where his &s;ufferings com|menced
with that agony in which his <HI>&s;oul
was exceeding &s;orrowful even unto death.</HI>
At the &s;pot where his generous &s;ufferings
on our account began, there al&s;o was his
glory to commence; and tho&s;e fields which
&s;o long had been his fa$$urite retreat, and
&s;o often had been con&s;ecrated by him to
meditation and prayer, were now to be
dignified with his la&s;t and parting &s;teps
towards heaven; a &s;ort of &s;ymbol, of devo|tion
and virtuous &s;ufferings being &s;teps that
prepare for a&s;cent to heaven.&mdash;There, we
are told, <HI>He lift up his hands, and ble&s;&s;ed
his di&s;ciples; and while he ble&s;&s;ed them,
he was parted from them.</HI> How beautiful
is this attitude of our departing Lord! How
well did &s;uch a conclu&s;ion &s;uit the re&s;t
of his life! <HI>Having loved $is own which
were in the world, he loved them to the end.</HI>
While he lived, he <HI>went about doing good:</HI>
He died, praying for his enemies; and
when he a&s;cended into heaven, it was in
the act of lifting up his hands and ble&s;&s;ing
his friends; like a dying parent giving his
<PB N="315" REF="326">
la&s;t benediction to his children and family.
A worthy pattern is here &s;et before us, of
the manner in which every good man
&s;hould wi&s;h to &s;pend his la&s;t moments, in
acts of devotion to God, and expre&s;&s;ions
of kindne&s;s and affection to his friends.&mdash;
While our Saviour was thus employed, he
was <HI>parted from his di&s;ciples; a cloud,</HI> it is
&s;aid, <HI>received him cut of their &s;ight</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Acts, i. 9.</NOTE>, <HI>and he
was carried up into heaven.</HI> Here were no
whirlwinds, no thunders, no chariots of
fire. Supernatural appearances of old, had
been accompanied with maje&s;ty of a terrible
kind. The law was given in the mi$&s;t
of lightnings and thunders. Elijah was
caught up into heaven in a fiery chariot.
But the Saviour of the world was gently
<HI>received up in a cloud;</HI> with that &s;ort of meek
and calm magnificence, which be&s;peaks the
peaceful genius of the Go&s;pel and its Author.
&mdash;Angels likewi&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;ted at this &s;o|lemnity,
as in every di&s;pen&s;ation friendly
to mankind the&s;e benevolent &s;pirits are re|pre&s;ented
<PB N="316" REF="327">
as taking part. At the creation
of the world, <HI>the morning &s;tars,</HI> it is &s;aid,
<HI>&s;ang together, and all the &s;ons of God &s;houted
for joy</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Job, xxxviii. 7.</NOTE>. At the birth of our Lord, we
hear of their &s;ongs of prai&s;e and joy; we
find them pre&s;ent at his re&s;urrection from
the dead; and now again at his a&s;cen&s;ion
into heaven. <HI>While his di&s;ciples looked &s;ted|fa&s;tly
towards heaven, as he went up, behold,
two men &s;tood by them in white apparel;
which al&s;o &s;aid, Ye men of Galilee, why &s;tand
ye gazing up into heaven? This &s;ame Je&s;us
which is taken up from you into heaven,
&s;hall &s;o come in like manner as ye have &s;een
him go into heaven</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts, i. 10, 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SUCH were the circum&s;tances which
accompanied that great and &s;ignal event
of Chri&s;t's a&s;cen&s;ion into heaven; all of
them very &s;olemn and &s;triking, and calcu|lated
to leave a deep impre&s;&s;ion on the
minds of his di&s;ciples.&mdash;Let us now pro|ceed
to con&s;ider the ends and purpo&s;es of
<PB N="317" REF="328">
our Saviour's a&s;cen&s;ion, as far as they are
revealed and made known to us; and, to|gether
with them, the effects which ought
thereby to be produced on our minds.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, by our Saviour's a&s;cen|&s;ion
into heaven, it was made to appear
that the great de&s;ign for which he de|&s;cended
to the earth was completely ful|filled.
A &s;olemn atte&s;tation was thus given
by God, to the virtue and efficacy of that
great &s;acrifice which he offered by his
death for the &s;ins of the world: It was de|clared
that, in con&s;ideration of the high
merits and generous &s;ufferings of the Son
of God, pardon and grace were to be
extended to the fallen race of men. There|fore,
<HI>God rai&s;ed him up from the dead, and
gave him glory, that our faith and hope might
&s;tand in God.</HI></P>
<P>Hence, the a&s;cen&s;ion of our Lord is to be
con&s;idered as a di&s;play from heaven of the
olive branch to mankind. It is a mo&s;t au|gu&s;t
ratification of that covenant of grace,
on which are founded all our hopes of
<PB N="318" REF="329">
acceptance with God. We lay under the
&s;entence of condemnation as an offending
guilty race, till Chri&s;t undertook our cau&s;e,
and by his re&s;urrection and a&s;cen&s;ion proved
that he &s;ucceeded in what he had under|taken.
As &s;oon as he was received up
into heaven, and &s;at down at the right
hand of God, the terrors of the law were
withdrawn. Antient prophecies were
ful$illed, which repre&s;ented the coming of
the Me&s;&s;iah as the renovation of the world,
as the aera of declared grace and peace to
mankind. The a&s;cen&s;ion of Chri&s;t was the
&s;ignal of his triumph over all the powers
of darkne&s;s. Long they had meditated
our r$in, and maintained the reign of
idolatry among the nations. But the pe|riod
was now come when their power was
to be overthrown. When Chri&s;t, as it
was predicted of old by the in&s;pired
P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>a&s;cended up on high, he led cap|tivity
captive, and gave gifts unto men.</HI> He
then &s;poiled <HI>principalities and powers</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Coleff. ii. 15.</NOTE>
<PB N="319" REF="330">
He <HI>de&s;troyed him that had the power of
death, that is the devil</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">$word$. ii. 14.</NOTE>; and the <HI>gifts</HI>
which, as tokens of victory, he be&s;towed
among his followers, were no le&s;s than
peace, pardon, and eternal life.&mdash;While
our Lord's a&s;cen&s;ion thus &s;erves to e&s;tabli&s;h
our faith in the Go&s;pel,</P>
<P>IT is, in the next place, to be viewed
by us, with re&s;pect to Chri&s;t him&s;elf, as
a merited re&s;toration to his original felicity.
As the Son of God, all glory belonged to
him for ever. The divine nature could
neither &s;uffer any real depre&s;&s;ion, nor re|ceive
any additional advancement. But
it was as a man, that he appeared and acted
on earth; that he &s;uffered and died. What
he had done in that character, enti$led him,
as a man, to the highe&s;t rewards. Ac|cordingly
it is in this view of merited re|compence,
that his a&s;cen&s;ion and exaltation
at the right hand of God, is always &s;et
forth in Scripture. Becau&s;e <HI>he made him|&s;elf
of no reputation, and took upon him the
<PB N="320" REF="331">
form of a &s;ervant; and being found in &s;a&s;$ion
as a man, he humbled him&s;elf, and became
obedient unto death, even the death of the
cro&s;s; therefore God hath highly exalted him,
and given him a name which is above every
name; that at the name of Je&s;us every knee
&s;hould bow&mdash;and every tongue confe&s;s that
Je&s;us Chri&s;t is Lord, to the glory of God
the Father</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Philipp. ii. $. &amp;c.</NOTE>.&mdash;In this con&s;titution of Pro|vidence,
an illu&s;trious te&s;timony was de|&s;igned
to be given of God's regard and
love to eminent righteou&s;ne&s;s. <HI>We &s;ee Je&s;us,</HI>
as the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks, <HI>for the &s;uffering of
death crowned with glory and honour</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. ii. 9.</NOTE>.
We &s;ee &s;ignal pre-eminence made the re|ward
of &s;ignal conde&s;cen&s;ion for the &s;ake
of mankind; and &s;elf-aba&s;ement and hu|miliation
made the road to glory. We
are taught, in this great in&s;tance, that God
never de&s;erts the cau&s;e that is his own, nor
leaves worth and piety to be finally op|pre&s;&s;ed;
though for a while he may allow
trials and hard&s;hips to be undergone by the
be&s;t men. No per&s;on could appear more
<PB N="321" REF="332">
neglected and for&s;aken by God, than our
Saviour was, for a &s;ea&s;on, when in the
hands of his foes. Important purpo&s;es of
Providence were, during that &s;ea&s;on, carried
on; but as &s;oon as tho&s;e purpo&s;es were
accompli&s;hed, God came forth in &s;upport
of righteou&s;ne&s;s and truth, and by the
high honours be&s;towed on Chri&s;t, e&s;tabli&s;hed
his eternal triumph over all his foes.</P>
<P>While we thus view our Saviour's a&s;|cen&s;ion
as a glorification ju&s;tly merited on
his own account, we cannot but on our
part highly rejoice in it from a &s;en&s;e of
the obligations we lie under to him. De|void
of every ju&s;t and honourable &s;enti|ment
mu&s;t he be, who partakes not with
cordial &s;atisfaction in the &s;ucce&s;s and
triumph of a generous benefactor, who,
for his &s;ake, had expo&s;ed him&s;elf to much
di&s;tre&s;s and danger.&mdash;In that holy Sacrament
which we this day celebrated, we beheld our
ble&s;&s;ed Saviour de&s;pi&s;ed and rejected of
men; we &s;aw him treated as the vile&s;t of
malefactors, led to the hill of Golgotha
with &s;corn and contempt, and there under|going
<PB N="322" REF="333">
all that the cruelty of his enemies could
contrive to inflict. All this we beheld him
patiently and cheerfully enduring for our &s;ake,
in order to accompli&s;h our redemption.&mdash;
Now, when at his next appearance we be|hold
&s;uch a glorious revolution; when we
behold him ri&s;ing from the dead, a&s;cending
into the highe&s;t heavens, &s;itting down there
at the right hand of God, and all things
in heaven and earth made to bow before
him, &s;hall not we, my brethren, with
thankful and devout hearts, partake joyfully
in his exaltation and felicity?&mdash;Thou,
O divine Benefactor! O illu&s;trious Re|&s;torer
of the lo&s;t hopes and happine&s;s of
mankind! Thou art mo&s;t worthy to be
thus rai&s;ed above all beings. Our &s;orrows
once were thine. <HI>For our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions
thou wert brui&s;ed; and for our iniquities,
wounded.</HI> Now, in thy joy we rejoice;
and in thine honours we triumph. We
with lifted hands will ever ble&s;s thee. Pro&s;|trate
at thy feet, we will join with all the
heavenly ho&s;ts in celebrating thy prai&s;es;
in a&s;cribing to <HI>Him that loved us, and
<PB N="323" REF="334">
wa&s;hed us from our &s;ins in his own blood,</HI> all
power, and glory, and dominion for ever!</P>
<P>IN the third place, Chri&s;t a&s;cended into
heaven that he might act there, in the
pre&s;ence of God, as our High Prie&s;t and
Interce&s;&s;or. This office which he per|forms,
was pre-&s;ignified under the Jewi&s;h
di&s;pen&s;ation, by the high prie&s;t entering
once every year, on the great day of atone|ment,
into the holie&s;t place in the temple,
and there &s;prinkling the blood of the &s;a|crifice
before the mercy-&s;eat. <HI>But Chri&s;t
being come, an High Prie&s;t of good things
to come, by a greater and more perfect ta|bernacle
not made with bands, neither by
the blood of goats and calves, but by his own
blood, he entered in once into the $oly place,
having obtained eternal redemption for us; be
is not entered into the holy places made with
hands, which are the figures of the true; but
into $eaven it&s;elf, now to appear in the pre|&s;ence
of God for us.&mdash;There,</HI> we are told, <HI>he
ever liveth to make interce&s;&s;ion for his
people</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Heb. ix. 11, 12. 14. Heb. vii. 25.</NOTE>&mdash;By his appearing in the human
<PB N="324" REF="335">
nature, while he is acting as interce&s;&s;or
for mankind, an everla&s;ting memorial is
pre&s;ented to the Almighty of the Re|deemer's
love to men. That &s;acrifice which
was offered on Mount Calvary, &s;till con|tinues
to a&s;cend before the throne; and
that blood which was &s;hed on the cro&s;s,
flows for ever in the &s;ight of God.</P>
<P>CONCERNING the nature of this inter|ce&s;&s;ion,
which our Saviour is repre&s;ented
as making in heaven, and his continuing to
appear in the human nature for that purpo&s;e,
I am aware that difficulties and objections
may be rai&s;ed by &s;ome. I readily admit, that
the whole doctrine revealed to us in Scrip|ture
relating to the incarnation of Chri&s;t,
the atonement made by his death, and the
nature of his interce&s;&s;ion for us in heaven,
is of a my&s;terious kind. It is what we
on comprehend in a very imperfect man|ner;
and when we attempt too particularly
to explain or di&s;cu&s;s any of the&s;e doctrines,
we are apt <HI>to darken coun&s;el by words
without knowledge</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Job, xxxviii. 2.</NOTE>&mdash;Let us not however
<PB N="325" REF="336">
imagine that the my&s;terious nature of tho&s;e
doctrines furni&s;hes any ju&s;t objection again&s;t
the truth of the chri&s;tian revelation. It
mu&s;t be con&s;idered, that this revelation pro|fe&s;&s;es
to give us &s;uch a di&s;covery of the
&s;piritual invi&s;ible world, and of the admi|ni&s;tration
of the divine government, as was
proper to be at pre&s;ent communicated to us.
In &s;uch a revelation of things invi&s;ible and
divine, and which &s;tretch far beyond the
reach of human knowledge or capacity,
it was naturally to be expected that matters
would occur which &s;hould be my&s;terious,
and incomprehen&s;ible by us. Indeed, it
would have been &s;trange and incredible if
it had been otherwi&s;e; if nothing had ap|peared
on &s;uch &s;ubjects, but what was level
to our apprehen&s;ion.&mdash;In the pre&s;ent ma|terial
&s;y&s;tem, in mid&s;t of which we live,
and where the objects that &s;urround us are
continually expo&s;ed to the examination of
our &s;en&s;es, how many things occur that are
my&s;terious and unaccountable? The philo|&s;opher,
age after age, has continued his
re&s;earches into matter. After all his re|&s;earches,
<PB N="326" REF="337">
will he, at this day, refu&s;e to ac|knowledge,
that, in material &s;ub&s;tances, qua|lities
have been di&s;covered, powers and
properties have been found, which it is
beyond his power to reconcile to the com|monly
received laws and operations of mat|ter,
and which he cannot bring within the
compa&s;s of any e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;tem and
theory? Shall this philo&s;opher then, who
finds him&s;elf &s;o often baffled in his en|quiries,
by meeting with wonders in matter
which he cannot explain, pre&s;ume to reject
a religious &s;y&s;tem, merely becau&s;e in treating
of an invi&s;ible world, and the admini|&s;tration
of government there carried on
by the Father of Spirits, particulars occur
which appear incomprehen&s;ible to him?&mdash;
My brethren, let us be a little more humble
and $ober in our attempts to philo&s;ophi&s;e.
Let us be thankful, that having received a
revelation, which, upon rational grounds,
&s;tands well atte&s;ted and confirmed, the
my&s;terious doct$$nes which occur in it are
all of them &s;uch as to be perfectly recon|cilable
with godline&s;s and virtue; nay,
<PB N="327" REF="338">
&s;uch as have a direct tendency to promote
the moral influence of virtue on the lives
of men; and to bring powerful con&s;olation
to them under many troubles.</P>
<P>THIS is remarkably exemplified in that
doctrine of which we are now treating, of
the office performed by o$r Lord upon his
a&s;cen&s;ion into heaven. A mediator and
interce&s;&s;or with God, is what mo&s;t nations
and religions have anxiou&s;ly &s;ought to ob|tain.
It has been at all times the favourite
wi&s;h and hope of men; and from their
earne&s;tne&s;s to have this wi&s;h gratified, they
contrived &s;ome form or other of mediation
and interce&s;&s;ion, on which they re&s;ted; &s;ome
favourite hero, or &s;aint, or tutelary &s;ubor|dinate
god, through who&s;e intervention
they &s;ought to obtain favour from the Su|preme
Governour of the univer&s;e. This
is an idea which we find prevailing under
mo&s;t of the modes of Pagan wor&s;hip. Men
were generally &s;en&s;ible that they were
guilty of offences again&s;t the Deity; that
their own &s;ervices were in&s;ufficient to ap|pea&s;e
<PB N="328" REF="339">
him; and that therefore they had no
title to expect his favour, unle&s;s &s;ome me|diator
of high merit was to e&s;pou&s;e their
intere&s;t and plead their cau&s;e.&mdash;This re|lief,
which the bewildered nations &s;ought
after in vain, is fully afforded us by the
go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. A real mediator is there
revealed, inve&s;ted with &s;uch characters as
give encouragement and &s;atisfaction to
every pious wor&s;hipper. The divine nature
of which he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, gives infinite merit
and efficacy to every cau&s;e which he under|takes;
and his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, at the &s;ame time,
the human nature, gives us the ju&s;te&s;t
ground to tru&s;t, that with compa&s;&s;ion and
tenderne&s;s he undertakes the cau&s;e of man|kind.</P>
<P>The di&s;covery therefore of Chri&s;t's acting
as our Interce&s;&s;or in heaven, is in the
highe&s;t degree favourable to religion and
virtue. It is &s;o far from being a doctrine
repugnant to the rea&s;on or to the natural
ideas and notions of mankind, that it ac|cords,
as has been ob&s;erved, in the general
view of it, with what has ever been their
<PB N="329" REF="340">
wi&s;h and their hope; and the evangelical
di&s;covery of the true Mediator, while it
bani&s;hes all the &s;uper&s;tition and idolatry
which heathen ignorance had attached to
a mediatory wor&s;hip, fulfils to Chri&s;tians
every purpo&s;e both of encouragement and
con&s;olation. It encourages the humble vir|tuous
man, who might be apt to look up
with di&s;tru&s;t to the awful Maje&s;ty of
Heaven. It brings con&s;olation to the pe|nitent
returning &s;inner, from the belief that,
unworthy as he is in him&s;elf, Chri&s;t the
Saviour is worthy, by his powerful inter|ce&s;&s;ion,
to procure his &s;alvation.&mdash;What
plan of religion could have been given more
&s;uited than this to the circum&s;tances of
man, in his pre&s;ent &s;tate of weakne&s;s and
infirmity? What more animating to every
&s;incere wor&s;hipper?&mdash;Let us &s;tudy to do
our be&s;t; and if our endeavours be faithful,
and our hearts be upright, we have an
advocate with the Father in heaven, on
who&s;e interce&s;&s;ion we can rely; One <HI>who
is able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t, all who come
unto God through him. We have not an
high prie&s;t which cannot be touched with the
<PB N="330" REF="341">
feeling of our infirmities; but who was
in all points tempted like as we are, yet
without &s;in. Let us therefore come boldly
to the throne of grace, that we may obtain
mercy, and find grace to help in time of
need</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Heb. vii. 25.&ndash;iv. 15, 16.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the la&s;t place, our Saviour a&s;cended
into heaven in order to exerci&s;e there the
office of our King, as well as of our High
Prie&s;t and Interce&s;&s;or. His a&s;cen&s;ion was
a &s;olemn inve&s;titure in that royal authority
with which he was to act as <HI>Head of the
Church,</HI> till the end of time. All power
in heaven and earth was committed to
him. In token of his being the Sovereign
of both worlds, in triumph he ro&s;e from
his earthly grave, and in triumph a&s;cended
into heaven. <HI>Therefore let all the hou&s;e of
I&s;rael know a&s;&s;uredly, that God hath made
him both Lord and Chri&s;t</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts, ii. 36.</NOTE>. <HI>I have &s;et my
king upon my holy hill of Zion. I will give
him the heathen for his inheritance, and the
uttermo&s;t parts of the earth for his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm ii. 6. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="342">
This view of our Lord's a&s;cen&s;ion and
exaltation obviou&s;ly commands, from all
Chri&s;tians, the mo&s;t profound reverence
and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. No longer let the humble
appearance he made on earth, vilify him to
our apprehen&s;ion. Never let the con&s;ider|ation
of his grace and goodne&s;s as our In|terce&s;&s;or
in heaven, be &s;eparated from the
thoughts of that awful maje&s;ty with which
his a&s;cen&s;ion clothes him. With impunity
none can offend him. If all the heavenly
ho&s;ts adore him, if the whole univer&s;e obey
him, what mu&s;t be the fate of tho&s;e, who,
being of all creatures the mo&s;t highly in|debted
to his goodne&s;s, revolt again&s;t his
government, and refu&s;e obedience to his
laws?</P>
<P>But while with awe and reverence the
a&s;cen&s;ion and regal character of our Saviour
is fitted to in&s;pire us, it communicates al&s;o
the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction and comfort to our
hearts. <HI>Let the children of Zion be joyful
in their king</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm cxlix. 2.</NOTE>. They have a Sovereign to
<PB N="332" REF="343">
who&s;e protection they can, with firm tru&s;t,
commit all their intere&s;ts in life and death.
There is no temptation, under which his
grace cannot be &s;ufficient for them; no di&s;|tre&s;s,
from which it is not in his power to
deliver them; no darkne&s;s, but he can en|lighten
by a ray &s;ent down from his eternal
throne. <HI>Lo! I am with you always, even
to the end of the world</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxviii. 20.</NOTE>. From that eminence
of cele&s;tial glory in which he re&s;ides, he
beholds and remarks whatever is carried
on throughout all his dominions. No &s;ecret
con&s;piracy can e&s;cape his view; no fraud
of wicked men or evil &s;pirits can baffle his
de&s;igns. <HI>The heathen may rage, and the
people imagine a vain thing. Kings of the
earth may &s;et them&s;elves, and the rulers take
coun&s;el together again&s;t the Lord and his
anointed. But he that &s;itteth in the heavens
&s;hall laugh; the Lord &s;hall have them in
deri&s;ion.</HI> As his watchful eye is ever open
to ob&s;erve, &s;o his almighty arm is ever
extended to guard, his church and people.

&mdash;The &s;ame characters of wi&s;dom and
power, of ju&s;tice and mercy, which we
a&s;cribe to the providence and dominion of
God the Father, belong, in their fulle&s;t
extent, to the kingdom and government of
Chri&s;t the Son of God. This peculiar &s;ati&s;|faction
his government affords us, that in
the mid&s;t of &s;overeign authority, we know
that he &s;till retains the &s;ame mild and com|pa&s;&s;ionate
&s;pirit which he &s;howed as our
High Prie&s;t. The meane&s;t of his &s;ubjects
is not overlooked by him. The inhabitant
of the mo&s;t ob&s;cure cottage, equally as the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the mo&s;t &s;plendid palace, dwells
under his protection. He li&s;tens to the
prayer of the poor, and de&s;pi&s;es not the
&s;ervices they yield him. The <HI>widow's
mite</HI> is in his &s;ight an acceptable offering;
and even a <HI>cup of cold water given to a
di&s;ciple in his name,</HI> pa&s;&s;es not without its
reward.&mdash;Hence the characters of his
regal admini&s;tration cannot be better de|&s;cribed
than in the beautiful language of
the prophetical P&s;almi&s;t: <HI>He &s;hall judge the
people with righteou&s;ne&s;s and the poor with
<PB N="334" REF="345">
judgment. The righteous &s;hall flouri&s;h in
his days. He &s;hall &s;ave the children of the
needy, and break in pieces the oppre&s;&s;or. He
&s;hall deliver the needy when be crieth; the
poor al&s;o, and him that hath no helper. His
name &s;hall endure for ever. It &s;hall be con|tinued

<P>WE have now under &s;everal views con|&s;idered
the a&s;cen&s;ion of Chri&s;t, and the
important purpo&s;es which were an&s;wered
by it. In going along, I have pointed out
&s;ome of the chief effects which ought to
be produced on us by this object of our
faith. Much more might be &s;aid on this
&s;ubject, did the bounds of a di&s;cour&s;e permit
it. One improvement of the &s;ubject
which the &s;acred writers often point out,
mu&s;t not be forgotten. <HI>If ye be ri&s;en with
Chri&s;t, &s;eek tho&s;e things which are above,
where Chri&s;t &s;itteth on the right hand of God.
Set your affections on things above, and not
<PB N="335" REF="346">
on things on the earth</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Coloff. iii. 1, 2.</NOTE>. A certain con|formity
with Chri&s;t, their great leader, in all
the circum&s;tances of his hi&s;tory, is in Scrip|ture
exacted from Chri&s;tians. As they
mu&s;t <HI>die with him to &s;in,</HI> they mu&s;t <HI>ri&s;e
with him unto newne&s;s of life;</HI> and with him
a&s;cend in heart to heaven, and dwell in
their affections where he is. The elevated
hopes which Chri&s;t, by his re&s;urrection and
a&s;cen&s;ion, has &s;et before us, ought to in&s;pire
Chri&s;tians with &s;uitable elevation of &s;enti|ment
above this pre&s;ent world.&mdash;As Chri&s;t
<HI>is in you the hope of glory, let every one who

<P>IT cannot but occur to every one who
has read the New Te&s;tament, even in
a cur&s;ory manner, that there is nothing
more warmly and more frequently incul|cated
in it, than peace and love, union and
&mdash;under&s;tanding among men. Were a
per&s;on to form to him&s;elf an idea of the
&s;tate of the chri&s;tian world, merely from
reading our &s;acred books, and thence in|ferring
how they would live who believed
<PB N="338" REF="349">
tho&s;e books to be divine, he would draw,
in his fancy, the faire&s;t picture of a happy
&s;ociety: he would expect to meet with
nothing but concord, harmony, and order;
and to find the voice of clamour and con|tention
for ever &s;ilent. But were &s;uch a
per&s;on, fond to be him&s;elf a witne&s;s and a
partaker of &s;uch a bli&s;sful &s;tate, to come
among&s;t us from afar, how mi&s;erably,
alas! would he be di&s;appointed, when in
the actual conduct of Chri&s;tians he di&s;co|vered
&s;o little corre&s;pondence with the mild
and peaceful genius of their profe&s;&s;ed re|ligion;
when he &s;aw the fierce &s;pirit of
contention o$$en raging unre&s;trained in
publick; and in private, the intercour&s;e of
men embittered, and &s;ociety di&s;ordered and
convul&s;ed with quarrels about trifles! Too
ju&s;tly might he carry away with him this
opprobrious report, that &s;urely tho&s;e Chri&s;|tians
have no belief in that religion they
profe&s;s to hold &s;acred, &s;eeing their practice
&s;o openly contradicts it.</P>
<P>In order to prevent, as much as we can,
this reproach from attaching to us, let us
<PB N="339" REF="350">
now &s;et our&s;elves to con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly the
importance and the advantages of <HI>living
peaceably with all men.</HI>&mdash;This duty may
be thought by &s;ome to po&s;&s;e&s;s a low rank
among the chri&s;tian virtues, and the phra&s;e
a <HI>peaceable man</HI> to expre&s;s no more than a
very inferiour character. I admit that gen|tlene&s;s,
candour, &s;en&s;ibility, and friend&s;hip<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vide Di&s;cour&s;es on the&s;e virtues in the preceding
Volumes.</NOTE>,
expre&s;s a higher degree of re$inement and
improvement in the di&s;po&s;ition; and that
a good Chri&s;tian ought to be di&s;tingui&s;hed
by active benevolence, and zeal for reme|dying
the mi&s;eries and promoting the fe|licity
of others. But let it be remembered,
that the love of peace is the foundation
of all tho&s;e virtues. It is the fir&s;t article
in the great chri&s;tian doctrine of charity;
and its obligation is &s;trict, in proportion as
its importance is obvious. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the
peace-makers; for they &s;hall be called the
children of God</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matth. v. 9.</NOTE>.&mdash;I &s;hall fir&s;t &s;how what
is included in the precept of <HI>living peaceably
<PB N="340" REF="351">
with all men;</HI> and next, what arguments
recommend our obedience to this precept.</P>
<P>I. THIS precept implies, in the fir&s;t place,
a &s;acred regard to the rules of ju&s;tice, in
rendering to every man what is his due.
Without this fir&s;t principle, there can be
no friendly commerce among mankind.
Ju&s;tice is the ba&s;is on which all &s;ociety
re&s;ts. Throw down its obligation, and at
that in&s;tant you bani&s;h peace from the
earth; you let rapine loo&s;e, and involve
all the tribes of men in perpetual ho&s;tility
and war. To live peaceably, therefore,
requires, as its fir&s;t condition, that we con|tent
our&s;elves with what is our own, and
never &s;eek to encroach on the ju&s;t rights
of our neighbour; that in our dealings,
we take no unfair advantage; but con|&s;cientiou&s;ly
adhere to the great rule of
doing to others, according as we wi&s;h they
&s;hould do to us. It &s;uppo&s;es that we never
knowingly abet a wrong cau&s;e, nor e&s;pou&s;e
an unju&s;t &s;ide, but always give our coun|tenance
to what is fair and equal. We
<PB N="341" REF="352">
are never to di&s;turb any man in the en|joyment
of his lawful plea&s;ure; nor to
hinder him from advancing his lawful pro|fit.
But under a &s;en&s;e of our natural
equality, and of that mutual relation which
connects us together as men, we are to
carry on our private intere&s;t in con&s;i&s;tency
with what is requi&s;ite for general order and
good. <HI>Render tribute to whom tribute is
due; fear to whom fear; honour to whom
honour. Covet not what is thy brother's.
Owe no man any thing, but to love one
another.</HI></P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place, the duty of living
peaceably, not only prohibits all acts of
open inju&s;tice, but requires us carefully to
avoid giving unnece&s;&s;ary provocation or
offence to others. When we con&s;ider from
what &s;mall beginnings di&s;cord often ari&s;es,
and to what a&s;toni&s;hing heights from &s;uch
beginnings it will grow, we will &s;ee much
cau&s;e to watch with care over our words
and actions, in our intercour&s;e with the
world. It ought to be an object of atten|tion
<PB N="342" REF="353">
&s;o to behave as never needle&s;sly to
exa&s;perate the pa&s;&s;ions of others. In par|ticular,
we are to guard again&s;t all improper
liberties of &s;peech, and contumelious re|flections
on per&s;ons and characters.&mdash;
The man of peace is mild in his demeanour,
and inoffen&s;ive in his di&s;cour&s;e. He ap|pears
to de&s;pi&s;e no man. He is not fond
of contradicting and oppo&s;ing, and is always
aver&s;e to cen&s;ure and to blame. He never
erects him&s;elf into the character of a dic|tator
in &s;ociety. He never officiou&s;ly &s;eeks
to intermeddle in the affairs of others, nor
to pry into their &s;ecrets; and avoids every
occa&s;ion of di&s;turbing the good will which
men appear to bear to one another.&mdash;
Oppo&s;ite to this, &s;tands the character of the
man of unpeac$able and quarrel&s;ome &s;pirit;
who, him&s;elf ea&s;ily provoked by every
tri&s;$e, is continually offending and pro|voking
others by the har&s;hne&s;s of his be|haviour.
He is loud in his cen&s;ures, po|&s;itive
in his opinions, and impatient of all
contradiction. He is a <HI>bu&s;y body in other
men's matters;</HI> de&s;cants on their characters,
<PB N="343" REF="354">
enquires into their conduct, and on the
authority of his own &s;u&s;picions, a&s;&s;igns
what motives he plea&s;es to their actions.
Into the violence of party-&s;pirit he never
fails to enter deeply; and con&s;idently a&s;|cribes
the wor&s;t principles to all who differ
from him in opinion. Such per&s;ons are
the pe$ts of &s;ociety, and the troublers of all
good order in human life. <HI>Let every man
&s;tudy to be quiet,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, <HI>and to do
his own bu&s;ine&s;s. Who art thou that judge&s;t
another man's &s;ervant? To his own ma&s;ter
he &s;tandeth or falleth</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">1 The&s;&s;. iv. 11. Rom. xiv. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the third place, the &s;tudy of peace
requires, that on &s;ome occa&s;ions we &s;cruple
not to give up our own opinion, or even
to depart from our &s;trict right, for the &s;ake of
peace.&mdash;At the &s;ame time, for preventing
mi&s;takes on this &s;ubject, it is proper to
ob&s;erve, that a tame &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to violence
and wrongs, is not required by religion.
We are not to imagine that the love of
<PB N="344" REF="355">
peace is only another name for cowardice;
or that it &s;uppre&s;&s;es every proper exertion
of a manly &s;pirit. The expre&s;&s;ions em|ployed
in the text, <HI>if it be po&s;&s;ible, as much
as lieth in you,</HI> plainly in&s;inuate, that there
are ca&s;es in which it may not be in our
power to <HI>live peaceably with all men.</HI>
Every man is allowed to feel what is due
to him&s;elf and his own character, and is
entitled to &s;upport properly his own rights.
In many ca&s;es the welfare of &s;ociety re|quires
that the attacks of the violent be
checked and re&s;i&s;ted.&mdash;What belongs to a
good and a wi&s;e man is, to look forward
coolly to the effects that are likely to follow
the rigorous pro&s;ecution of any private
rights of his own. If the&s;e appear to be
pregnant with mi&s;chiefs to the &s;ociety with
which he is connected, in a much greater
proportion than any advantage they can
bring to him&s;elf, it then becomes his duty
rather quietly to &s;uffer wrong, than to
kindle the flames of la&s;ting di&s;cord. But
how many are there, who, having once
begun a claim, e&s;pou&s;ed a &s;ide, or engaged
<PB N="345" REF="356">
in a controver&s;y, are determined to pur&s;ue
it to the la&s;t, let the con&s;equences be what
they will? Fal&s;e notions of honour are
brought in to ju&s;tify their pa&s;&s;ions. Pride
will not allow them to yield, or to make
the lea&s;t conce&s;&s;ion, when the true point
of honour would have led to generous ac|knowledgments
and conde&s;cen&s;ion. They
never make the fir&s;t advances to returning
reconciliation and peace. They are haughty
in their claims, and require great &s;ubmi$$ion
before they can be appea&s;ed.&mdash;The
lover of peace, on the other hand, looks
upon men and manners in a milder and
&s;ofter light. He views them with a philo|&s;ophick,
or rather a chri&s;tian eye. Con|&s;cious
that he him&s;elf has been often in
the wrong; &s;en&s;ible that offence is fre|quently
thought to be given, where no
injury was intended; knowing that all men
are liable to be mi&s;led by fal&s;e reports into
unju&s;t &s;u&s;picions of their neighbours; he
can pa&s;s over many things without di&s;turb|ance
or emotion, which, in more com|bu&s;tible
tempers, would kindle a flame.
<PB N="346" REF="357">
In all publick matters in which he is en|gaged,
he will not be pertinaciou&s;ly adhe&s;ive
to every mea&s;ure which he has once pro|po&s;ed,
as if his honour were nece&s;&s;arily
engaged to carry it through. If he &s;ee
the pa&s;&s;ions of men beginning to ri&s;e and
&s;well, he will endeavour to allay the grow|ing
&s;torm. He will give up his favourite
&s;chemes, he will yield to an opponent,
rather than become the cau&s;e of violent
embroilments; and, next to religion and
a good con&s;cience, the cau&s;e of peace and
union will be to him mo&s;t &s;acred and dear.</P>
<P>IN the fourth place, our &s;tudy of peace,
in order to be effectual, mu&s;t be of an ex|ten&s;ive
nature. It mu&s;t not be limited to
tho&s;e with whom by intere&s;t, by good
opinion, or by equality of &s;tation, we are
connected. <HI>Live peaceably with all men,</HI>
&s;ays the Apo&s;tle. No man is to be con|temned
becau&s;e he is mean, or to be treated
with incivility becau&s;e he is one in whom
we have no concern. Even to tho&s;e whom
we account bad men, the obligation of liv|ing
<PB N="347" REF="358">
at peace extends. This is not incon|&s;i&s;tent
with that ju&s;t indignation which we
ought to bear again&s;t their crimes. Without
entering into any clo&s;e connection with
them, without admitting them to be our
friends and companions, it is certainly po&s;|&s;ible
to live among&s;t them in a peaceable
manner. Human &s;ociety is at pre&s;ent com|po&s;ed
of a confu&s;ed mixture of good and
evil men; and from our imperfect know|ledge
of characters, it is often not ea&s;y to di&s;|tingui&s;h
the one cla&s;s of men from the other.
We are commonly prejudiced in favour
of tho&s;e who concur with us in our modes
of thinking; and are prone to look with
an evil eye on tho&s;e who differ from us
in &s;ubjects of importance. But if all the
&s;uppo&s;ed blemi&s;hes of tho&s;e with whom we
differ in opinion; if the heretical doctrines
which we a&s;cribe to them, or the bad prin|ciples
with which we charge them, were
&s;u$ficient to ju&s;tify the breach of peace,
very little harmonious corre&s;pondence would
remain among men. Appearances of re|ligious
zeal have been too often employed
<PB N="348" REF="359">
to cover the pride and ill-nature of turbu|lent
per&s;ons.&mdash;The man of peace will
bear with many who&s;e opinions or practices
he di&s;likes, without an open and violent
rupture. He will con&s;ider it as his duty
to gain upon them by mildne&s;s, and to
reclaim them as far as he can from what
is evil, by calm per&s;ua&s;ion, rather than to
attempt reforming them by acrimony and
cen&s;ure.&mdash;Neither indeed is it every
man's office to &s;et up for a reformer of
the world. Every man, it is true, is bound
to promote reformation by his per&s;onal
example. But if he a&s;&s;ume a &s;uperiority
to which he has no title; and with rude
and indi&s;creet zeal, admini&s;ter reproofs, and
thru&s;t him&s;elf forward into the concerns
of others, he is likely to do much more
hurt than good; to break the peace of the
world, without doing &s;ervice to the cau&s;e of
true religion.</P>
<P>If it thus appears to be our duty to ex|tend
our &s;tudy of peace throughout the
wide &s;phere of all who are around us, it
will naturally occur that there is a certain
<PB N="349" REF="360">
narrower &s;phere within which this &s;tudy
ought to be particularly cultivated; to|wards
all tho&s;e, I mean, with whom Nature
or Providence has joined us in clo&s;e union,
whether by bonds of friend&s;hip, kindred,
and relation, or by the nearer ties of do|me&s;tick
and family connection. There, it
mo&s;t highly concerns every one to put in
practice all the parts of that peaceable and
amicable behaviour which I before have
de&s;cribed; to guard again&s;t every occa&s;ion
of provocation and offence; to overlook
accidental &s;tarts of ill-humour; to put the
mo&s;t favourable interpretation on words
and actions. The clo&s;er that men are
brought together, they mu&s;t unavoidably
rub, at times, the more on one another.
The mo&s;t delicate attentions are requi&s;ite,
of cour&s;e, for preventing tempers being
ruffled, and peace being broken, by tho&s;e
&s;light failings from which none are exempt.
It is within the circle of dome&s;tick life, that
the character of the man of peace will be
particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed as amiable; and
where he will mo&s;t comfortably enjoy the
fruits of his happy di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P><PB N="350" REF="361">
HAVING now explained the precept in
the text, and &s;hown what is included in
living peaceably with all men, I come next to
&s;ugge&s;t &s;ome con&s;iderations for recommend|ing
this peaceable di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>LET us recollect, in the fir&s;t place, as a
bond of union and peace, the natural re|lation
which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts among us all as men,
&s;prung from one father, connected by one
common nature, and by fellow&s;hip in the
&s;ame common nece&s;&s;ities and wants; con|nected
as Chri&s;tians clo&s;er &s;till, by acknow|ledgment
of the &s;ame Lord, and partici|pation
of the &s;ame divine hopes. Ought
le&s;&s;er differences altogether to divide and
e&s;trange tho&s;e from one another, whom &s;uch
ancient and &s;acred bonds unite? In all
other ca&s;es, the remembrance of kindred,
or brotherhood, of a common parent, and
common family, tends to &s;often the har&s;her
feelings, and often has influence, when
feuds ari&s;e, to melt and overcome the heart.
Why &s;hould not a remembrance of the
&s;ame kind, have &s;ome effect with re&s;pect
to the great brotherhood of mankind?&mdash;
<PB N="351" REF="362">
How unnatural and &s;hocking is it, if, on
occa&s;ion of &s;ome angry expre&s;&s;ion or trifling
affront, to which &s;udden pa&s;&s;ion or mi&s;|taken
report has given ri&s;e, a man &s;hall de|liberately
go forth with the barbarous pur|po&s;e
of plunging his &s;word into his brother's
brea&s;t? What a reproach to rea&s;on and hu|manity,
that a ridiculous idea of honour, de|rived
from times of Gothick gro&s;&s;ne&s;s and
ignorance, &s;hould &s;tain the annals of modern
life with &s;o many tragical &s;eenes of horror!</P>
<P>Let the &s;entiment of our natural con|nection
with each other as men, di&s;po&s;e
us the more to peace, from a reflection on
our common failings, and the mutual al|lowances
which tho&s;e failings oblige us to
make. A &s;en&s;e of equity &s;hould here ari&s;e, to
prompt forbearance and forgivene&s;s. Were
there any man who could &s;ay that he had
never, in the cour&s;e of his life, &s;uffered
him&s;elf to be tran&s;ported by pa&s;&s;ion, or
given ju&s;t ground of offence to any one,
&s;uch a man might have &s;ome plea for im|patience,
when he received from others un|rea&s;onable
treatment. But if no &s;uch per|fectly
<PB N="352" REF="363">
unexceptionable characters are to be
found, how unju&s;t is it not to give to others
tho&s;e allowances which we, in our turn, mu&s;t
claim from them?&mdash;To our own failings
we are always blind. Our pride and &s;elf-conceit
render us quarrel&s;ome and conten|tious,
by nouri&s;hing a weak and childi&s;h
&s;en&s;ibility to every fancied point of our
own honour or intere&s;t, while they &s;hut up
all regard to the honour or intere&s;t of our
brethren. From the high region of ima|ginary
&s;elf-e&s;timation, let us de&s;cend to
our own ju&s;t and proper level. Let us
calmly reflect on the place we hold in &s;o|ciety,
and on the ju&s;tice that is due to
others. From &s;uch reflections we will learn
to be more humble in our claims, and more
moderate in our preten&s;ions; and many of
the cau&s;es of animo&s;ity and contention will
die away.</P>
<P>LET us con&s;ider, in the next place, how
trifling and incon&s;iderable, for the mo&s;t
part, the cau&s;es are of contention and di&s;|eord
among mankind, and how much they
<PB N="353" REF="364">
de&s;erve to be overlooked by the wi&s;e and
the good. When we view the eagerne&s;s
with which conte&s;ts are agitated in &s;ociety,
and look to the bitterne&s;s and wrath they
&s;o oft occa&s;ion, one would think that all
were at &s;take, and that there could be no
life, no happine&s;s on earth, unle&s;s to him
who was victorious in the conte&s;t, And
yet, in how few in&s;tances has there been
any ju&s;t ground for this mighty ferment
of &s;pirits?&mdash;You have been &s;lighted, per|haps,
by a &s;uperiour; you have been un|gratefully
treated by a friend; a rival has
over-reached you by fraud; or overcome
you by more powerful intere&s;t. Amid&s;t
the bu&s;tle of life, amid&s;t the interfering and
cro&s;&s;ing of various pur&s;uits and intere&s;ts,
are not &s;uch incidents to be expected by
every one? Ought you not to have been
prepared for encountering them without
pa&s;&s;ion or violence, as evils belonging to
the common lot of humanity? As light
bodies are &s;haken and torn by every breath
of wind, while tho&s;e that are &s;olid re&s;i&s;t
the bla&s;t; &s;o it is only the little and mean
<PB N="354" REF="365">
mind that lo&s;es po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it&s;elf on every
trifling provocation; while a great and
firm &s;pirit keeps its place, and re&s;ts on a
ba&s;is of its own, un&s;haken by the common
di&s;turbances of life.&mdash;Of what &s;mall mo|ment
to your real happine&s;s, are many of
tho&s;e injuries which draw forth your re|&s;entment?
They may affect in &s;ome de|gree
your worldly intere&s;ts; but can they
affect your true honour as a man? Can
they deprive you of peace of con&s;cience,
of the &s;atisfaction of having acted a right
part, of the plea&s;ing &s;en&s;e of being e&s;teemed
by men, and the hope of being rewarded
by God, for your genero&s;ity and forgive|ne&s;s?&mdash;
In the moments of eager contention,
all is magnified and di&s;torted in its appear|ance.
A fal&s;e light is thrown on every
object. Nothing appears to be what it
really is. But let the hour of violence pa&s;s
over; let the cour&s;e of time bring for|ward
recollection and calmne&s;s, and you will
wonder at your former violence. Objects
which once were &s;o formidable, will then
have di&s;appeared. A new &s;cene has taken
<PB N="355" REF="366">
place; and the grounds of former conten|tion
will &s;eem as dreams of the night, which
have pa&s;&s;ed away.&mdash;Act then now the part
of a man, by anticipating that period of
coolne&s;s, which time will certainly bring.
You will then cea&s;e to break the peace of
&s;ociety with your angry contentions. You
will &s;how that magnanimity which belongs
to tho&s;e who depend not for their hap|pine&s;s
merely on the occurrences of the
world. <HI>He that is &s;low to anger, is better
than the mighty; and he that ruleth his &s;pirit,
than he that taketh a city</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xvi. 32.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LET us now con&s;ider the different con|&s;equences
of a contentious &s;pirit, and of a
peaceable di&s;po&s;ition, with re&s;pect to our
happine&s;s and enjoyment. The founda|tion
of happine&s;s mu&s;t certainly be laid
within our brea&s;ts. If one be pained and
unea&s;y there, external circum&s;tances, how
flouri&s;hing &s;oever, avail him nothing: And
what feelings are more unea&s;y and painful
<PB N="356" REF="367">
than the workings of four and angry pa&s;|&s;ions?
Great and manifold as the natural
and unavoidable di&s;tre&s;&s;es of our pre&s;ent
&s;tate are, they are &s;mall in compari&s;on of
the evils which men bring upon them|&s;elves,
and bring upon one another, by
variance and di&s;eord. I &s;peak not now of
public calamities, of faction and ambition
raging through the world, and ho&s;tile
armies laying wa&s;te the earth with de&s;ola|tion
and blood&s;hed. Confining our views
&s;olly to private life, how mi&s;erably is all
its comfort and order de&s;troyed by tho&s;e
jealou&s;ies, feuds, and animo&s;ities, that &s;o
often break the peace of families, tear
a&s;under the bonds of friend&s;hip, and poi&s;on
all that &s;ocial intercour&s;e which men were
formed to entertain with one another?
From a &s;mall chink, which &s;ome rude
hand has opened, the bitter waters of &s;trife
ea&s;ily flow. But of this we may be a&s;|&s;ured,
that a full portion of their bitterne&s;s
&s;hall be ta&s;ted by him who has let them
forth. Never was any man active in di&s;|quieting
others, who did not at the &s;ame
<PB N="357" REF="368">
time di&s;quiet him&s;elf. While the tempe&s;t
which he has rai&s;ed may be bur&s;ting on
his neighbour, he will be obliged to feel
the hurricane raging in his own brea&s;t:
and from his re&s;tle&s;$ne&s;s, impatience, and
eagerne&s;s, joined with anxious trepidations
and fears, will often &s;uffer more than all
that he can in&s;$ict on his adver&s;ary.</P>
<P>From &s;uch painful &s;en&s;ations the man of
peace is free. A mild, unruffled, &s;elf-po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing
mind is a ble&s;&s;ing more important
to real felicity, than all that can be gained
by the triumphant i&s;&s;ue of &s;ome violent
conte&s;t. Never was a truer axiom pro|nounced
by any mouth, than what was
uttered by the wi&s;e man of old; <HI>Better is
a dinner of herbs where love is, than a
&s;talled ox and hatred therewith</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xv. 17.</NOTE>. With a
&s;canty provi&s;ion of the good things of this
world, a wi&s;e man may be contented and
happy; but without peace, all the luxuries
of the rich lo&s;e their reli&s;h.&mdash;While
among the &s;ons of &s;trife all is tempe&s;tuous
<PB N="358" REF="369">
and loud; the &s;mooth &s;tream, the &s;erene
atmo&s;phere, the mild zephyr, are the proper
emblems of a gentle temper, and a peace|able
life. Nor is this merely a poetical
allu&s;ion. The ordinary language of di&s;|cour&s;e,
where the terms are &s;o often em|ployed
of a &s;torm of pa&s;&s;ion, a calm mind,
a rough or a fiery temper, plainly &s;how
that all men are &s;en&s;ible of &s;ome analogy
between a peaceable di&s;po&s;ition, and tho&s;e
&s;cenes of external nature that are uni|ver&s;ally
agreeable and plea&s;ant. The con|dition
of tho&s;e who are living in unity
with their brethren, is likened by the
p&s;almi&s;t David <HI>to the dew of Herm$n; the
dew that de&s;cended on the mountains of
Zion, where the Lord commanded the ble&s;&s;|ing,
even life for evermore</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm cxxxiii. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>While the man of this di&s;po&s;ition is
happy within him&s;elf, let it not be for|gotten,
that he is at the &s;ame time gaining
on all around him. From the quarrel&s;ome
and rude, all men naturally recoil; and,
<PB N="359" REF="370">
except when nece&s;&s;ity obliges them, avoid
their intercour&s;e. But the lover of peace
conciliates gener$l good-will; and is both
re&s;pected and beloved. Though no ab&s;o|lute
&s;ecurity can be devi&s;ed again&s;t the
malice and inju&s;tice of the world, yet, for
the mo&s;t part, it will be found that there is
no more effectual guard again&s;t violence,
no &s;urer road to a &s;afe enjoyment of life,
than an e&s;tabli&s;hed character for benignity
and regard to peace. The man of this
character, if unju&s;tly attacked, will have
many to defend him and take his part. In
his pro&s;perity he will be unenvied, and his
misfortunes will be alleviated by general
&s;ympathy.</P>
<P>LET us con&s;ider, in the la&s;t place, how
&s;trongly the precept in the text is enforced
by the mo&s;t &s;acred religious obligations.
You all know what a high place charity,
under all its forms of meekne&s;s, forbearance,
and forgivene&s;s, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in the Chri&s;tian
&s;y&s;tem. To bring authorities in &s;upport
of this, were to recite a great part of the
<PB N="360" REF="371">
New Te&s;tament before you.&mdash;The God
whom we wor&s;hip, is known by the title
of <HI>the God of Peace.</HI> That evil &s;pirit who
is oppo&s;ite to him, is de&s;cribed with all
the characters which expre&s;s malignity;
<HI>the enemy, the accu&s;er, the liar, the de&s;troyer.</HI>
When Chri&s;t came into the world as our
Saviour, he is &s;tyled the Prince of Peace.
The ble&s;&s;ings which were proclaimed at
his birth were, <HI>peace upon earth, and good|will
towards men.</HI> The whole of his life
was one continued exemplification of all
the virtues that characterize the meek, the
peaceable, and forgiving &s;pirit. Never was
any one's temper tried by &s;o many and &s;o
great provocations; never did any one
retain, under the&s;e provocations, &s;uch a
calm and unruf$led tenour of mind; in&s;o|much
that the Apo&s;tle Paul, on an occa&s;ion
of earne&s;t intreaty to the Corinthians, <HI>be|&s;eeches</HI>
them <HI>by the weakne&s;s and gentlene&s;s
of Chri&s;t,</HI> as the mo&s;t noted and well-known
parts of his character<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">2 Corinth. x. 1.</NOTE>. What can be &s;aid
<PB N="361" REF="372">
higher of any virtue than that it is the qua|lity,
under the denomination of which,
the Son of God cho&s;e to be known when
he dwelt on earth? Let us add, that it is
al&s;o the di&s;tingui&s;hing character of God's
own &s;pirit. The Holy Gho&s;t is called the
<HI>Spirit of Peace. Meekne&s;s, gentlene&s;s, and
long &s;uffering,</HI> are expre&s;sly denominated
<HI>his fruits;</HI> and on a certain memorable
occa&s;ion, his appearance was marked with
&s;ignals that expre&s;s the mild and quiet
&s;pirit as di&s;tingui&s;hed from violence. When
Elijah the great prophet was called to go
forth and &s;tand before the Lord, <HI>behold a
great and &s;trong wind rent the mountains,
but the Lord was not in the wina; and after
the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was
not in the earthquake; and after the earth|quake
a fire, but the Lord was not in the
fire. After that, there came forth a &s;till
&s;mall voice. When Elijah heard it,</HI> he
knew the &s;ymbol of God's &s;pirit; <HI>he
wrapped his face in his mantle,</HI> and wor|&s;hipped<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">1 King$, xix. 11, 12, 13.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="373">
AFTER &s;o many te&s;timonies given by the
&s;acred writings to the high importance of
a meek and peaceable &s;pirit, what &s;hall we
think of tho&s;e, who, in their &s;y&s;tem of
religion, make &s;light account of this virtue;
who are ready to quarrel with others on the
mo&s;t trifling occa&s;ions; who are conti|nually
di&s;quieting their families by peevi&s;h|ne&s;s
and ill-humour; and by malignant
reports, ra$$$ng di&s;&s;en&s;ion among friends
and neighbours? Can any claims to &s;ound
belief, or any &s;uppo&s;ed attainments of
grace, &s;upply the defect of &s;o cardinal a
virtue as charity and love?&mdash;Let &s;uch
per&s;ons particularly bethink them&s;elves how
little the &s;pirit which they po&s;&s;e&s;s, &s;its them
for the kingdom of heaven, or rather how
far it removes them from the ju&s;t hope of
ever entering into it. Hell is the proper
region of enmity and &s;trife. There dwell
unpeaceable and &s;iery &s;pirits, in the mid&s;t
of mutual hatred, wrath, and tumult. But
the kingdom of heaven is the kingdom
of peace. There, <HI>charity never &s;aileth.</HI>
There, reigneth the God of Love; and
<PB N="363" REF="374">
in his pre&s;ence, all the ble&s;&s;ed inhabit|ants
are of one heart and one &s;oul. No
&s;tring can ever be heard to jar in that ce|le&s;tial
harmony; and therefore the con|tentious
and violent are, both by their own
nature and by God's decree, for ever ex|cluded
from the heavenly &s;ociety.&mdash;As the
be&s;t preparation for tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed man&s;ions,
let us ever keep in view that direction
given by an Apo&s;tle; <HI>Follow peace with all
men, and holine&s;s, without which no man
&s;hall &s;ee the Lord.</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii. 14.</NOTE>. To the cultivation of
amity and <HI>peace</HI> in all our &s;ocial intercour&s;e,
let us join <HI>holine&s;s;</HI> that is, piety and active
virtue: and thus we &s;hall pa&s;s our days com|fortably

in the practice of religious duties there is
found an inward joy, here &s;tyled the <HI>joy
of the Lord;</HI> and in the next place, that
this joy is ju&s;tly denominated the <HI>&s;trength</HI>
of the righteous.</P>
<P>I. JOY is a word of various &s;ignification.
By men of the world, it is often u&s;ed to
expre&s;s tho&s;e fla&s;hes of mirth which ari&s;e
from irregular indulgences of &s;ocial plea|&s;ure;
and of which it is &s;aid by the wi&s;e
<PB N="366" REF="377">
man, that in &s;uch <HI>laughter the heart is &s;or|rowful,
and the end of that mirth is hea|vine&s;s</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xiv. 13.</NOTE>.
It will be ea&s;ily under&s;tood that
the <HI>joy</HI> here mentioned partakes of nothing
akin to this; but &s;ignifies a tranquil and
placid joy, an inward complacency and &s;a|tisfaction,
accompanying the practice of
virtue, and the di&s;charge of every part of
our duty. A joy of this kind is what we
a&s;&s;ert to belong to every part of religion;
to characteri&s;e religion wherever it is ge|nuine,
and to be e&s;&s;ential to its nature.&mdash;In
order to a&s;certain this, let us con&s;ider the
di&s;po&s;ition of a good man with re&s;pect to
God; with re&s;pect to his neighbours; and
with re&s;pect to the government of his
own mind.</P>
<P>WHEN we con&s;ider in what manner re|ligion
requires that a good man &s;hould
&s;tand affected towards God, it will pre|&s;ently
appear that rational enlightened piety
opens &s;uch views of him as mu&s;t commu|nicate
<PB N="367" REF="378">
joy. It pre&s;ents him, not as an
awful unknown Sovereign, but as the
Father of the univer&s;e, the Lover and Pro|tector
of righteou&s;ne&s;s, under who&s;e go|vernment
all the intere&s;ts of the virtuous
are, &s;afe. With delight the good man
traces the Creator throughout all his works,
and beholds them every where reflecting
&s;ome image of his &s;upreme perfection. In
the morning dawn, the noontide glory, and
the evening &s;hade; in the fields, the moun|tains,
and the flood, where worldly men
behold nothing but a dead, unintere&s;ting
&s;cene; every object is enlivened and ani|mated
to him by the pre&s;ence of God.
Amid&s;t that divine pre&s;ence he dwells with
reverence, but without terror. Con&s;cious
of the uprightne&s;s of his own intentions,
and of the &s;idelity of his heart to God, he
con&s;iders him&s;elf, by night and by day, as
under the protection of an invi&s;ible guar|dian.
He <HI>lifts up his eyes to the hills from
whence cometh his aid;</HI> and commits him|&s;elf
without di&s;tru&s;t to the <HI>Keeper of I&s;rael,
who never &s;lumbers nor &s;leeps.</HI> He li&s;tens
<PB N="368" REF="379">
to the gracious promi&s;es of his word. With
comfort he receives the declarations of his
mercy to mankind through a Great Re|deemer;
in virtue of who&s;e atonement pro|vi&s;ion
is made for pardon to human infir|mities,
and for our reception in the end
into a happier world. All the various de|votional
exerci&s;es of faith and tru&s;t in God,
all the cordial effu&s;ions of love and gratitude
to this Supreme Benefactor in the acts of
prayer and prai&s;e, afford &s;cope to tho&s;e
emotions of the heart which are of the
mo&s;t plea&s;ing kind; and which diffu&s;e a
gentle and &s;oftening tenderne&s;s over the af|fections.
In a word, a truly pious man,
who has always before him an object &s;o
&s;ublime and intere&s;ting as this great Father
of the univer&s;e, on whom his thoughts can
dwell with &s;atisfaction, may be truly &s;aid
to partake highly in the <HI>joy of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>But it may here be objected, are there
no mortifications and griefs that particu|larly
belong to piety? What &s;hall we &s;ay
to the tear of repentance, and to that hu|miliation
of confe&s;&s;ion and remor&s;e, which
<PB N="369" REF="380">
may, at times, be incumbent on the mo&s;t
pious, in this &s;tate of human infirmity?&mdash;
To this I reply, fir&s;t, that although there
may be &s;ea&s;ons of grief and dejection in
a cour&s;e of piety, yet this is not incon&s;i&s;tent
with the joy of the Lord, being, on the
whole, the predominant character of a
good man's &s;tate; as it is impo&s;&s;ible that,
during this life, perpetual brightne&s;s can
remain in any quarter, without &s;ome dark
cloud. But I mu&s;t ob&s;erve next, that even
the penitential &s;orrows and relentings of a
pious heart, are not without their own
&s;atisfactions. A certain degree of plea&s;ure
is mingled with the tears which the return|ing
offender &s;heds, in the hours of com|punction;
the ingenuous contrition that he
feels, relieves his heart, at the &s;ame time
that it gives it pain. If we attend to the
workings of human nature on other oc|ca&s;ions,
we &s;hall find that it is no unu&s;ual
thing for a &s;ecret my&s;terious plea&s;ure to be
mixed with painful feelings. This we all
know to be the ca&s;e in tho&s;e exerci&s;es of
pity and commi&s;eration to which we are
<PB N="370" REF="381">
led by &s;ympathy with the afflicted. We
grieve and are pained for their di&s;tre&s;s;
yet we chu&s;e to indulge that grief; &s;atis|faction
is felt in the indulgence; and we
are unwillingly &s;eparated from the object
which has occa&s;ioned this painful, but
tender &s;ympathy. A mixture &s;omewhat
&s;imilar, of plea&s;ure and pain, takes place in
the &s;entiments of penitential &s;orrow, which
good men &s;ometimes feel. In the mid&s;t
of their di&s;tre&s;s, they are &s;oothed by an
internal con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that they are affected
as it becomes them to be; that they feel
as they ought to feel; and they are gra|dually
relieved by the hope ri&s;ing in their
brea&s;t, of finding mercy and acceptance with
their Creator and Redeemer. Where the
mind is properly in&s;tructed in religion, it
will not long be left in a &s;tate of over|whelming
dejection, but will return to
tranquillity, and repo&s;&s;e&s;s again the <HI>joy of
the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN we con&s;ider, next, the di&s;po&s;ition
of a good man towards his fellow-creatures,
<PB N="371" REF="382">
we &s;hall find here the joy of the Lord
exerting its in$luence fully. That mild and
benevolent temper to which he is formed
by virtue and piety; a temper that is free
from envious and malignant pa&s;&s;ions, and
that can look with the eye of candour and
humanity on &s;urrounding characters, is a
con&s;tant &s;pring of cheerfulne&s;s and &s;erenity.
Indeed, if there be joy at all in human life,
it is, perhaps, in this &s;tate of the mind that it
is mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly felt, and felt with the lea&s;t
check or allay. It is truly &s;aid, <HI>to the wicked
there is no peace.</HI> In proportion as any
one of the bad pa&s;&s;ions predominates in the
brea&s;t, it never fails, in the &s;ame proportion,
to corrode the heart, and to &s;hed over all
the comforts of life a poi&s;onous and bane|ful
influence. Whereas all tho&s;e exerci&s;es
of friend&s;hip, compa&s;&s;ion, and genero&s;ity,
which are e&s;&s;ential to the di&s;po&s;ition of a
virtuous man, are to him lively enjoyments
of plea&s;ure in them&s;elves, and increa&s;e the
&s;atisfaction which he ta&s;tes in all the other
innocent plea&s;ures of life. He knows that
he enjoys them along with the good-will
<PB N="372" REF="383">
and the ble&s;&s;ings of all to whom he has
&s;tudied to do good. When he can cheer
the dejected or gladden the &s;orrowful, he
is cheered and gladdened him&s;elf. If his
circum&s;tances allow him not to do all the
good he wi&s;hes to have done, yet in the
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of good intentions there is
always an inward &s;atisfaction; and in tho&s;e
le&s;&s;er offices of kindne&s;s and humanity
which are within the &s;phere of every man
to perform, he enjoys innumerable oc|ca&s;ions
of being plea&s;ed and happy.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to that part of religion
which con&s;i&s;ts in the government of a man's
own mind, of his pa&s;&s;ions and de&s;ires, it
may be thought that much joy is not to be
expected. For there religion appears to
lay on a &s;evere and re&s;training hand. Strict
temperance and &s;elf-denial are often requi|&s;ite;
and much is on &s;ome occa&s;ions
abridged, of what is apt to be reckoned the
full and free enjoyment of life. Yet, here
al&s;o it will be found, that the <HI>joy of the Lord</HI>
takes place. To a per&s;on ju&s;t reclaimed
<PB N="373" REF="384">
from the exce&s;&s;es of &s;en&s;ual indulgence, the
re&s;traints impo&s;ed by virtue will, at fir&s;t,
appear uncouth and mortifying. But let
him begin to be accu&s;tomed to a regular
life, and his ta&s;te will &s;oon be rect$fied, and
his feelings will change. In purity, tem|perance,
and &s;elf-government, there is
found a &s;atisfaction in the mind, &s;imilar to
what re&s;ults from the enjoyment of perfect
health in the body. A man is then con|&s;cious that all is found within. There is
nothing that gnaws his &s;pirit; that makes
him a&s;hamed of him&s;elf; or di&s;compo&s;es
his calm and orderly enjoyment of life.
His con&s;cience te&s;tifies that he is acting
honourably. He enjoys the &s;atisfaction of
being ma&s;ter of him&s;elf. He feels that
no man can accu&s;e him of degrading his
character by ba&s;e plea&s;ures or low pur&s;uits;
and knows that he will be honoured and
e&s;teemed by tho&s;e who&s;e honour and e&s;|teem
he would mo&s;t de&s;ire; all which are
&s;en&s;ations mo&s;t plea&s;ing and gratifying to
every human heart.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="385">
FROM this &s;light &s;ketch it plainly appears,
that there is an inward &s;atisfaction, ju&s;tly
termed <HI>the joy of the Lord,</HI> which runs
through all the parts of religion. This is
a very different view of religion from what
is entertained by tho&s;e who con&s;ider it as
a &s;tate of perpetual penance; to which its
votaries unwillingly &s;ubmit, merely from
the dread of puni&s;hment in hell; and who
bargain for the rewards of another world,
by a renunciation of all that is agreeable
or comfortable to man in this world. Such
conceptions of religion are contradicted by
the experience of every truly virtuous man,
and are directly oppo&s;ite to the views of
religion given us in the word of God;
wherein its ways are termed <HI>ways of plea|&s;antne&s;s
and paths of peace;</HI> and where we
are a&s;&s;ured that <HI>in the keeping of God's com|mands,</HI>
there is an immediate <HI>great reward.</HI></P>
<P>But what it concerns us at pre&s;ent to
remark is, that &s;ome experience of this
<HI>joy of the Lord</HI> which I have de&s;cribed,
enters as an e&s;&s;ential part into the character
of every good man. In proportion to the
<PB N="375" REF="386">
degree of his goodne&s;s, to his improvement
and progre&s;s in virtue, will be the degree
of his participation in the plea&s;ure and joy
of religion. But wherever &s;uch plea&s;ure
is entirely unknown; wherever there is no
&s;atisfaction and delight in the di&s;charge of
virtuous duties, there we are obliged to
conclude, that religion does not &s;ub&s;i&s;t in
its genuine &s;tate. It is either a &s;anctimo|nious
&s;how merely; a forced appearance
of piety and virtue, tinctured, perhaps,
with &s;ome deep &s;hades of &s;uper&s;tition; or,
at be&s;t, it is religion in its mo&s;t weak and
imperfect &s;tate. It is de$icient in the re|generation
of the heart. The man him&s;elf
is in a divided and hovering &s;tate, between
two oppo&s;ite principles of action; partly
a&s;&s;ecting to be obedient to God's com|mands,
and partly a &s;lave to the world.
The truth and importance of this ob&s;erv|ation
will more fully appear, when we pro|ceed
to what was propo&s;ed for the</P>
<P>I$d Head of di&s;cour&s;e,&mdash;to &s;how in what
re&s;pects the joy of the Lord is ju&s;tly &s;aid
to be <HI>the &s;trength of the righte$us</HI></P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="387">
IN the fir&s;t place, it is the animating
principle of virtue; it &s;upports its influence,
and a&s;&s;i&s;ts it in becoming both per&s;evering
and progre&s;&s;ive. Experience may teach us
that few undertakings are la&s;ting or &s;uc|ce&s;sful,
which are accompanied with no
plea&s;ure. If a man's religion be con&s;idered
merely as a ta&s;k pre&s;cribed to him, which
he feels burden&s;ome and oppre&s;&s;ive, it is
not likely that he will long con&s;train him|&s;elf
to act again&s;t the bent of inclination.
It is not until he feels &s;omewhat within
him which attracts him to his duty, that
he can be expected to be con&s;tant and
zealous in the performance of it. Was it
ever found that a per&s;on advanced far in
any art or &s;tudy, whether of the liberal or
mechanical kind, in which he had no plea|&s;ure,
to which he had no heart, but which,
from motives merely of intere&s;t or fear,
he was compelled to undertake? Is it then to
be thought that religion will prove the only
exception to what holds &s;o generally, and
will continue an actuating principle of con|duct,
whether we love it for its own &s;ake,
or not? It is true, that a &s;en&s;e of duty may
<PB N="377" REF="388">
&s;ometimes exerci&s;e its authority, though
there be no &s;en&s;ations of plea&s;ure to a&s;&s;i&s;t
it. Belief of tho&s;e religious principles in
which we were educated, and dread of
future puni&s;hment, will, in ca&s;es where no
&s;trong temptation a&s;&s;ails us, re&s;train from
the commi&s;&s;ion of atrocious crimes, and
produce &s;ome decent regularity of external
conduct. But on occa&s;ions when incli|nation
or intere&s;t prompt to &s;ome tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion
of virtue, which &s;afety or &s;ecrecy
encourages, and which the example of the
world &s;eems to countenance; when the
pre&s;ent advantage or plea&s;ure appears to be
all on one &s;ide, and no &s;atisfaction ari&s;es
to counterbalance it on the other; is it to
be thought that con&s;cience will then &s;tand
its ground, with one who never was at|tached
to virtue on its own account, and
never experienced any joy in following its
dictates?&mdash;But the&s;e are the occa&s;ions
when the <HI>joy of the Lord</HI> proves the <HI>&s;trength
of the righteous man.</HI> Accu&s;tomed to take
plea&s;ure in doing his duty; accu&s;tomed to
look up to God with delight and com|placency,
<PB N="378" REF="389">
and to feel him&s;elf happy in all
the offices of kindne&s;s and humanity to men
around him; accu&s;tomed to rejoice in a
clear co$&s;cience, in a pure heart, and the
hope of heavenly bli&s;s; he cannot think of
parting with &s;uch &s;atisfactions for the &s;ake
of any worldly bribe. There is &s;omething
within his heart, that pleads for religion
and virtue. He has &s;een their beauty; he
has ta&s;ted their &s;weetne&s;s: and having &s;uch
plea&s;ures within him&s;elf, to oppo&s;e to all the
plea&s;ures of &s;in, he is enabled to maintain
his integrity inviolate; or if in any degree
he has deviated from it, &s;peedy remor&s;e is
awakened, and he cannot be &s;atisfied with
him&s;elf till he returns back to the right
path. Thus, through <HI>the joy of the Lord,</HI>
religion becomes in him <HI>the &s;pirit of love,
and power, and of a &s;ound mind</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. i. 7.</NOTE>. It is the
<HI>peace of God, which pa&s;&s;eth under&s;tanding,
keeping his mind and heart</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Philipp. iv. 7.</NOTE>. It is the
<HI>path of the ju&s;t, which is as the light, &s;hining
more and more unto the perfect day.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="390">
IN the next place, the joy of the Lord
is the <HI>&s;trength of the righteous,</HI> as it is their
great &s;upport under the di&s;couragements
and trials of life. In the days of their
ea&s;e and pro&s;perity, it guards them, as has
been &s;hown, again&s;t the temptations of
vice; and in the general tenor of con|duct,
attaches them to the &s;ide of virtue:
and when the evil days come, wherein
they &s;hall have no plea&s;ure from the
world, it &s;upplies them with plea&s;ures of
another kind, to pre&s;erve them from im|proper
de&s;pondency, or from entering into
evil cour&s;es for the &s;ake of relief.&mdash;A
good man's friends may for&s;ake him; or
may die, and leave him to mourn. His
fortune may fail, or his health decay. Ca|lumny
and reproach may unju&s;tly attack
his character. In circum&s;tances of this
kind, where worldly men become peevi&s;h,
di&s;pirited, and fretful, he who is acquainted
with the plea&s;ures, of religion and virtue,
can po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf calm and undi&s;turbed.
He has re&s;ources within unknown to the
world, whence light <HI>ari&s;es to him in dark|ne&s;s.</HI>
<PB N="380" REF="391">
From the gloom or turbulence of ex|ternal
evils he can retreat to the enjoyment
of his own mind. In the exerci&s;es of
devotion, his heart is elevated, and the
cares of the world are forgotten. In his
regular di&s;charge of all the &s;ocial duties of
life, he finds cheerfulness and plea&s;ure.
Hence his temper is not &s;oured. He ac|cu&s;es
neither God nor man for the un|avoidable
misfortunes of life. He &s;ubmits
with patience to the common lot; looking
forward with good hope to better days;
retaining always honourable thoughts of
God's providence, and &s;entiments of can|dour
towards men.&mdash;In this manner, his
experience of the joy of the Lord becomes
<HI>his &s;trength;</HI> as in$u&s;ing into his mind a
principle of firmne&s;s and &s;tability, and
enabling him, in every &s;ituation of fortune,
to continue the &s;ame.</P>
<P>FROM the view which we have now
taken of the &s;ubject, it mu&s;t clearly appear,
that to every one who wi&s;hes to po&s;&s;e&s;s
the &s;pirit, and to &s;upport the character of
<PB N="381" REF="392">
genuine goodne&s;s and virtue, it is an object
mo&s;t de&s;irable and important, to acquire a
prevailing reli&s;h for the plea&s;ures of reli|gion.
As this is a mo&s;t important object,
&s;o al&s;o it is an attainable one by every man
who&s;e intentions are &s;incerely upright. For
let it be remembered, that the <HI>joy of the
Lord,</HI> which I have de&s;cribed as <HI>the &s;trength
of the righteous,</HI> is not to be under&s;tood as
a privilege belonging only to &s;aints of the
highe&s;t order, who can a&s;&s;uredly tru&s;t to
their being the cho&s;en of God. It is not
to be under&s;tood of high raptures, and
tran&s;ports of religious fervour. It is not
even confined to the &s;ole plea&s;ures of inter|cour&s;e
with God in devotion; though a&s;|&s;uredly
the&s;e con&s;titute one great part of
the <HI>joy of the Lord,</HI> and are auxiliary to
its exerci&s;e on every other occa&s;ion. The
<HI>joy of the Lord</HI> is to be under&s;tood of that
joy, which accompanies the whole of reli|gious
and virtuous practice; that &s;atisfac|tion,
which a good man feels in the di&s;|charge
of his duty, which accompanies the
performance of all the offices which be|long
<PB N="382" REF="393">
to the &s;tation of life in which he is
placed; whether the&s;e be of a publick na|ture
or private; &s;ocial and dome&s;tick, or
relating particularly to the exerci&s;es of re|ligious
wor&s;hip and devotion.</P>
<P>To attain this &s;pirit, of con&s;idering the
di&s;charge of our duty as our plea&s;ure and
happine&s;s, is certainly not incompatible
with our pre&s;ent &s;tate of infirmity. It is
no more than what good men have often
attained and have te&s;ti$ied of it; that <HI>their
delight was in the law of God;</HI> that his
<HI>&s;tatutes were &s;weet to their ta&s;te;</HI> that <HI>they
had taken them as an heritage for ever, for
they were the rejoicing of their heart. I
delight to do thy will, O my God; thy law is
within my heart</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;. x$. 8. cxix. 111.</NOTE>.&mdash;According to the pro|&s;iciency
which men have made in virtue,
will be the degree of &s;atisfaction which
they receive from the performance of it:
but where no plea&s;ures or &s;atisfactions of
this kind are known, men have much
ground to di&s;tru&s;t their preten&s;ions to god|line&s;s
or chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="394">
It is therefore of high importance, that
all proper means be employed to form our
internal ta&s;te to a proper reli&s;h for this joy
of the Lord. For it is not to be di&s;|&s;embled,
that much is again&s;t us in our
endeavours to have our di&s;po&s;ition formed
for reli&s;hing virtuous plea&s;ures. We breathe
in this world a &s;ort of vitiated air, very
unfriendly to the health and foundne&s;s of
all our moral feelings. From our earlie&s;t
youth we are bred up in admiration of the
external advantages of fortune; and are
accuftomed to hear them extolled as the
only real and fub&s;tantial goods. We mu&s;t
therefore begin by &s;tudying to correct
the&s;e fal&s;e ideas, and per&s;uading our&s;elves
that there are other things be&s;ides riches,
honours, and &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures, that are
good for man; that there are joys of a
&s;piritual and intellectual nature, which di|rectly
affect the mind and heart, and
which confer a &s;atisfaction both more
refined and more la&s;ting than any worldly
circum&s;tances can confer. In order to have
a fair trial of the value and effect of tho&s;e
<PB N="384" REF="395">
&s;piritual enjoyments, we mu&s;t forbear pol|luting
our&s;elves with gro&s;s and guilty plea|&s;ures;
we mu&s;t even refrain from indulg|ing
worldly plea&s;ures that appear innocent,
in a profu&s;e and intemperate degree, le&s;t
they &s;en&s;ualize and deba&s;e our feelings.
By pre&s;erving a wi&s;e and manly temper|ance
in lower plea&s;ures and pur&s;uits, we
will then allow tho&s;e of a higher kind to
occupy their proper place; and &s;hall be in
a &s;ituation fairly to compare the pure &s;en|&s;ations
of plea&s;ure which ari&s;e from the
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of di&s;charging our duty, with
the tran&s;ient and turbid gratifications of
&s;in and the world. To &s;uch endeavours
of our own, for rectifying and improving
our ta&s;te of plea&s;ure, let us join frequent
and &s;ervent prayer to God, that he may
enlighten and reform our hearts; and by
his &s;pirit communicate that joy to our
&s;ouls, which de&s;cends from him, and which
he has annexed to every part of religion
and virtue as the <HI>&s;trength of the righteous.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">On the Folly of the Wi&s;dom of the World.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>1 CORINTH. iii. 19.</BIBL>
<Q>The wi&s;dom of this world is fooli&s;hne&s;s with
God.&mdash;</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE judgment which we form of our|&s;elves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XVII.</NOTE>
often differs widely from that
which is formed of us by God, who&s;e
judgment alone is always conformable to
the truth. In our opinion of the abilities
which we imagine our&s;elves to po&s;&s;e&s;s,
there is always much &s;elf-flattery; and in
the happine&s;s which we expect to enjoy in
this world, there is always much deceit.
As there is a worldly happine&s;s, which God
<PB N="386" REF="397">
perceives to he no other than concealed
mi&s;ery; as there is a worldly honour,
which in his e&s;timation is reproach; &s;o, as
the text informs us, there is a <HI>wi&s;dom of
this world,</HI> which <HI>is fooli&s;hne&s;s with God.</HI>
A&s;&s;uredly there is nothing in which it im|ports
us more that our judgment &s;hould
agree with the truth, than in what relates
to wi&s;dom. It is the qualification upon
which every man is inclined to value him|&s;elf,
more than on any other. They who
can with patience &s;uffer imputations on
other parts of their character, are ready to
lo&s;e their temper, and to feel &s;ore and hurt
when they are attacked $or deficiency in
prudence and judgment. Wi&s;dom is ju&s;tly
con&s;idered as the guide of conduct. If
any capital error &s;hall take place re&s;pecting
it; if one &s;hall mi&s;take that for wi&s;dom
which at bottom is mere folly, &s;uch a
mi&s;take will pervert the fir&s;t principles of
conduct, and be perpetually mi&s;leading a
man through the whole of life.&mdash;As the
text plainly intimates that this mi&s;take does
often take place in the world, and as it
<PB N="387" REF="398">
materially concerns us all to be on our
guard again&s;t &s;o great a danger, I &s;hall
endeavour to &s;how, fir&s;t, what the nature
and &s;pirit of that <HI>wi&s;dom of the world</HI> is,
which is here condemned; and next, in
what &s;en&s;e and on what account it is &s;tyled
<HI>fooli&s;hne&s;s with God.</HI></P>
<P>I. LET us con&s;ider the nature of that
wi&s;dom which is reprobated in the text as
fooli&s;hne&s;s with God. It is &s;tyled the
<HI>wi&s;dom of this world;</HI> that is, the wi&s;dom
which is mo&s;t current, and mo&s;t prized in
this world; the wi&s;dom which particularly
di&s;tingui&s;hes the character of tho&s;e who
are commonly known by the name of <HI>men
of the world.</HI> Its fir&s;t and mo&s;t noted di&s;|tinction
is, that its pur&s;uits are confined
entirely to the temporal advantages of the
world. Spiritual ble&s;&s;ings, or moral im|provements,
the man of this &s;pirit rejects as
a &s;ort of airy un&s;ub&s;tantial enjoyments,
which he leaves to the &s;peculative and the
&s;imple; attaching him&s;elf wholly to what
he reckons the only &s;olid goods, the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
<PB N="388" REF="399">
of riches and influence, of reputa|tion
and power, together with all the con|veniencies
and plea&s;ures which opulent
rank or &s;tation can procure.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uit of the&s;e favourite ends he is
not in the lea&s;t &s;crupulous as to his choice
of means. If he prefer tho&s;e which are
the faire&s;t, it is not becau&s;e they are fair,
but becau&s;e they &s;eem to him mo&s;t likely
to prove &s;ucce&s;sful. He is &s;en&s;ible that it
is for his intere&s;t to pre&s;erve decorums,
and to &s;tand well in the publick opinion.
Hence he is &s;eldom an openly profligate
man, or marked by any glaring enormities
of conduct. In this re&s;pect, his character
differs from that of tho&s;e who are com|monly
called <HI>men of plea&s;ure.</HI> Them he
con&s;iders as a thoughtle&s;s giddy herd, who
are the victims of pa&s;&s;ion and momentary
impul&s;e. The thorough-bred man of the
world is more &s;teady and regular in his
pur&s;uits. He is, for the mo&s;t part, compo&s;ed
in his manners, and decent in his vices.
He will often find it expedient to be e&s;|teemed
by the world as worthy and good.
<PB N="389" REF="400">
But to be thought good, an&s;wers his pur|po&s;e
much better than &s;ubjecting him&s;elf
to become really &s;uch; and what he can
conceal from the world, he conceives to be
the &s;ame as if it had never been.&mdash;Let
me here remark in pa&s;&s;ing, that the cha|racter
which I am now de&s;cribing, is one
le&s;s likely to be reclaimed and reformed, than
that of tho&s;e whom I mentioned above as
the men of plea&s;ure. With them, vice
breaks forth in occa&s;ional fits and &s;tarts;
with the other, it grows up into a hardened
and confirmed principle. In the mid&s;t of
the gro&s;s irregularities of plea&s;ure, circum|&s;tances
often force remor&s;e on the &s;inner's
mind. Moments of compunction ari&s;e,
which may be &s;ucceeded by conviction and
reformation. But the cool and temperate
plan of iniquity, on which the man of
worldly wi&s;dom proceeds, allows the voice
of con&s;cience to be longer &s;ilent. The
alarm which it gives, is not &s;o loud and
violent as to awaken him at once from his
evil cour&s;es, and in&s;tantly to prepare him
for a better mind.</P>
<P><PB N="390" REF="401">
The man of the world is always a man
of &s;elfi&s;h and contracted di&s;po&s;ition. Friends,
country, duty, honour, all di&s;appear from
his view, when his own intere&s;t is in que&s;|tion.
He is of a hard heart; he choo&s;es
indeed to be &s;o, le&s;t at any time the un|guarded
effu&s;ions of kind affections &s;hould
carry him beyond the line of worldly wi&s;|dom.
The more thoroughly that the &s;pirit
of the world has taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him,
the circle of his affections becomes always
the narrower. His family will perhaps
find place, as connected with his own im|portance,
and with his plans either of power
or wealth; but all beyond that circle are
excluded from any particular regard. It
is his great principle never to embark &s;e|riou&s;ly
in any undertaking, from which
he fore&s;ees no benefit likely to redound to
him&s;elf. Publick &s;pirit he con&s;iders either
as a mere chimera created by the &s;imple,
or a pretence employed by the artful for
their own purpo&s;e. Judging of the re&s;t
of the world by what he feels within him|&s;elf,
he proceeds on the &s;uppo&s;ition that
<PB N="391" REF="402">
all men are carrying on intere&s;ted de&s;igns
of their own, and of cour&s;e is ever on his
guard again&s;t them. Hence, to the cor|dialities
of friend&s;hip he is an entire
&s;tranger; too much wrapt up in him&s;elf,
indeed, to be a friend to any one; and if
his prudence re&s;trains him from being an
open and violent enemy, yet he is always
an unforgiving one.</P>
<P>Candour, openne&s;s, and &s;implicity of
manners, are ridiculed by the man of this
de&s;cription, as implying mere ignorance of
the world. Art and addre&s;s are the qua|lities
on which he values him&s;elf. For
the mo&s;t part, he would choo&s;e to &s;upplant
a rival by intrigue, rather than to overcome
him by fair oppo&s;ition. Indeed, what men
call policy and knowledge of the world, is
commonly no other thing than di&s;&s;imulation
and in&s;incerity. The world is a great &s;chool,
where deceit in all its forms is one of the
le&s;&s;ons that is fir&s;t learned, and mo&s;t eagerly
caught by &s;uch as a&s;pire to be pro&s;icients
in worldly wi&s;dom. A man of the world,
in &s;hort, is one, who, upon any call of in|tere&s;t,
<PB N="392" REF="403">
flatters and deceives you; who can
&s;mile in your face, while he is contriving
plans for your ruin; who, upon no oc|ca&s;ion,
thinks of what is right, or fit, or
honourable; but only of what is expedient
and u&s;eful to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I HAVE dwelt the more fully on the
delineation of this character, that each of
us might learn whether there be any fea|ture
in it that applies to him&s;elf; as it is a
character too frequently met with in the
world, and not always &s;o &s;everely repro|bated
as it ought to be. Let me now a&s;k,
whether &s;uch a character as I have de|&s;cribed
be in any re&s;pect an amiable one?
Is the man of the world, poli&s;hed, and
plau&s;ible, and courtly, as in his behaviour
he may be, one whom you would choo&s;e
for a companion and bo&s;om-friend? Would
you wi&s;h him for a &s;on, a brother, or a
hu&s;band? Would you reckon your&s;elf &s;afe
in con&s;iding your intere&s;ts to him, or en|tru&s;ting
him with your &s;ecrets? Nay, let
me a&s;k, if he be one whom in your hearts
<PB N="393" REF="404">
you re&s;pect and honour? His &s;hrewdne&s;s
and abilities you may perhaps admire;
&s;tand in awe of him you may; and for
the &s;ake of advantage, may wi&s;h him to be
on your &s;ide. But could you honour him
as a parent, or venerate him as a magi&s;|trate;
or would you wi&s;h to live under
him as a &s;overeign? Of what real value
then, let me a&s;k, is that boa&s;ted wi&s;dom of
the world, which can neither conciliate
love, nor produce tru&s;t, nor command in|ward
re&s;pect?&mdash;At the &s;ame time, I
admit that the man of the world may be a
man of very con&s;iderable abilities. He
may di&s;play talents of many different &s;orts.
Be&s;ides art and &s;agacity, he may po&s;&s;e&s;s
genius and learning; he may be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
for eloquence in &s;upporting his
own cau&s;e; he may have valour and cou|rage
to defend him&s;elf again&s;t his enemies.
&mdash;But ob&s;erve, I entreat you, a con&s;e|quence
that follows. You &s;ee in this in|&s;tance,
that the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed human
abilities, when they are &s;eparated from
virtue and moral worth, lo&s;e their chief
<PB N="394" REF="405">
eminence and lu&s;tre, and are deprived of
all valuable efficacy. They dwindle into
de&s;picable talents, which have no power to
command the hearts, nor to en&s;ure the re|&s;pect
and honour of mankind. Let it be
carefully ob&s;erved, and always remembered,
that integrity, probity, and moral worth,
are e&s;&s;entially req$$&s;ite to give the &s;tamp
of real excellence to any powers or
abilities which the human mind can po&s;|&s;e&s;s.&mdash;Having
now con&s;idered the nature
and effect of worldly wi&s;dom with re&s;pect
to men, let us enquire,</P>
<P>II. How it &s;tands with re&s;pect to God.
It is &s;aid in the text, to be <HI>fooli&s;hne&s;s with
God.</HI> It is &s;o in three re&s;pects: It is con|temptible
in God's &s;ight; it is ba&s;&s;led in its
attempts by God; or, when its attempts
are &s;ucce&s;sful, they are allowed to produce
nothing but di&s;appointment and vanity.</P>
<P>FIRST, it is contemptible in God's &s;ight.
Plea&s;ed and &s;atis&s;ied as the wi&s;e man of
the world may be with him&s;elf, and ho|noured
<PB N="395" REF="406">
as he may fancy him&s;elf to be by
the multitude, let him be morti&s;ied with
reflecting that, in the eye of him who is the
Supreme Judge of all worth, his character
is mean and wretched. That which God
declares him&s;elf to love and honour, is
<HI>truth in the inward parts;</HI> the fair, &s;incere,
and candid mind. He who <HI>walketh up|rightly
and worketh righteou&s;n$&s;s,</HI> is the per|&s;on
who &s;hall <HI>abide in his tabernacle, and
dwell in his holy hill.</HI> When our ble&s;&s;ed
Lord de&s;igned to mark one of his followers
with peculiar di&s;tinction and honour, he
&s;aid of him, <HI>Behold an I&s;raelite indeed, in
whom there is no guile</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">John, i. 47.</NOTE>; a character &s;o di|rectly
the rever&s;e of worldly wi&s;dom, that
from this circum&s;tance alone you may
judge in what rank that wi&s;dom &s;tood with
him.</P>
<P>But it is not only from the declarations
of the Scripture, but from the whole cour&s;e
of Providence, that we learn the contempt
in which God holds the wi&s;dom of the
<PB N="396" REF="407">
world. Who were they on whom he con|ferred
the highe&s;t marks of di&s;tinction
which ever honoured mankind; whom he
&s;ingled out to be the companions of Chri&s;t,
the workers of miracles, the publi&s;hers of
everla&s;ting happine&s;s to mankind? Were
they the wi&s;e men of the world, the refined,
and the politi$$$, who were employed as
the in&s;truments of God on this great oc|ca&s;ion?
No: he cho&s;e a few plain, &s;imple,
unde&s;igning men, in order to make fooli&s;h
the <HI>wi&s;dom of the world,</HI> and by their means
to overthrow the e&s;tabli&s;hments of the
artful, the learned, and the mighty.&mdash;
To this day, God in the cour&s;e of his
Providence be&s;tows tho&s;e external advan|tages
which the men of the world &s;o ear|ne&s;tly
pur&s;ue, with apparent di&s;regard of
worldly wi&s;dom. He allows no fixed nor
regular connexion to &s;ub&s;i$$$ between an
artful political conduct, and riches, repu|tation,
or honours; he allows them not
this mark of value; he does not always
give the race to the &s;wift, nor the battle
to the &s;trong, nor riches to men of under|&s;tanding;
<PB N="397" REF="408">
but, on the contrary, &s;catters the
advantages of fortune with a promi&s;cuous
hand; and often allows them to be attained
by the vile&s;t and lowe&s;t of men, who nei|ther
by worldly wi&s;dom, nor any other ta|lent
whatever, had the &s;malle&s;t title to de|&s;erve
them.&mdash;Judge then, ye wi&s;e men of
this world, whether your characters and
pur&s;uits be not mo&s;t contemptible in God's
&s;ight, when you behold tho&s;e &s;piritual ble&s;&s;|ings
which he e&s;teems, withheld from you,
and be&s;towed only on the good and the
pious; and tho&s;e worldly ble&s;&s;ings which
you covet, when at any time they are al|lowed
to you, yet allo$ed only as a portion
in common to you with the refu&s;e of man|kind,
with many ch$racters &s;o infamous
that you your&s;elves de&s;pi&s;e them?</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place, the wi&s;dom of the
world <HI>is fooli&s;hne&s;s with God,</HI> becau&s;e it is
baffled by him. Some triumphs he has oc|ca&s;ionally
allowed it to gain, in order to carry
on &s;ome &s;pecial purpo&s;e that his Providence
had in view. Hence a &s;plendid conqueror,
<PB N="398" REF="409">
or a &s;ucce&s;sful con&s;pirator, dazzle at times
the publick eye, and attract imitators of
their characters and exploits. But, if you
exten&s;ively con&s;ult hi&s;torical annals, and
much more, if you will attentively con&s;ider
what is known to happen in private life,
you will find the examples to be few and
rare, of wicked, unprincipled men attaining
fully the accompli&s;hment of their cra&s;ty de|&s;igns.&mdash;It
is true, that the ju&s;tice of Heaven
is not, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate, fully manife&s;ted,
by rendering to every man according to
his deeds. But I believe it will be found
by attentive ob&s;ervers, that there are two
ca&s;es in which, perhaps more than in any
other, the divine government has, through|out
all ages, rendered it&s;elf apparent and
&s;en&s;ible to men. The&s;e are, humbling the
high imaginations of the proud, and taking
the wi&s;e in their own craftine&s;s. By many
&s;ignal in&s;tances of the intervention of Pro|vidence
in both the&s;e ca&s;es. God hath deep|ly
marked the traces of an awful govern|ment,
even in this introductory &s;tate; and
forced a reverence of his ju&s;tice upon the
<PB N="399" REF="410">
minds of men. As he will not permit any
greatne&s;s to lift it&s;elf up again&s;t his power,
&s;o neither will he permit any art to prevail
again&s;t his coun&s;els. While the crafty pro|ject
many a di&s;tant plan, and wind their
way mo&s;t warily and cunningly, as they
think, to &s;ucce&s;s; how often does the Al|mighty,
by means of &s;ome &s;light and
&s;eemingly contingent event, &s;top the wheel
at once from farther motion, and leave
them to the bitterne&s;s of humbling di&s;ap|pointment?
<HI>He that &s;itteth in the heavens
&s;hall laugh; the Lord &s;hall have them in de|ri&s;ion.
Then,</HI> it is immediately added, <HI>&s;hall
he &s;peak to them in wrath, and vex them in
&s;ore di&s;plea&s;ure</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. ii. 4, 5.</NOTE>. The edifice of crooked
policy which they had erected again&s;t his
decree, was an edifice of du&s;t: no &s;ooner
does he blow upon it with the breath of
his mouth, than it falls to the ground. <HI>The
wicked are &s;nared in their own devices.
They are caught in the pit which their hands
had digged. This is the purpo&s;e that is pur|po&s;ed
<PB N="400" REF="411">
upon the whole earth; and this is the
hand that is &s;tretched out upon all the nations</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah, xiv. 26.</NOTE>!</P>
<P>IN the third place, the wi&s;dom of the
world is <HI>fooli&s;hne&s;s with God;</HI> becau&s;e,
though it &s;hould be allowed by Providence
to run, without di&s;turbance, its fulle&s;t ca|reer,
and to compa&s;s &s;ucce&s;sfully whatever
it had projected, yet it can produce nothing
in the i&s;&s;ue, worthy of the pur&s;uit of a truly
wi&s;e man. It is a wi&s;dom which over|reaches
and counteracts it&s;elf; and in|&s;tead
of expected happine&s;s, ends in mi|&s;ery.
&mdash;If the exi&s;tence of another world
be admitted, can he be accounted wi&s;e,
who frames his conduct &s;olely with a view
to this world, and beyond it has nothing
to look for but puni&s;hment? Is he a wi&s;e
man, who exchanges that which is eternal,
for that which is temporary; and though
it were to gain the whole world, expo&s;es
him&s;elf to lo&s;e his own &s;oul?&mdash;But laying
another world out of the que&s;tion, taking
things on the footing of this life only, &s;till
<PB N="401" REF="412">
it can be clearly &s;hown, that the crooked
wi&s;dom of the world is no better than fool|i&s;hne&s;s.
For what is the amount of all that
this wi&s;e man hath gained, or can gain,
after all the toil he has undergone, and all
the &s;acrifices he has made, in order to at|tain
&s;ucce&s;s? He has &s;upplanted a rival;
he has defeated an enemy; he has ob|tained,
perhaps, a &s;plendid e&s;tabli&s;hment
for him&s;elf and his family. But how is
all this &s;ucce&s;s enjoyed? with a mind often
ill at ea&s;e; with a character dubious at the
be&s;t, &s;u&s;pected by the world in general,
&s;een through by the judicious and di&s;cern|ing.
For the man of the world $latters
him&s;elf in vain, if he imagines that by the
plau&s;ible appearances of his behaviour, he
can thoroughly conceal from the world
what he is, and keep them ignorant of the
hollow principles upon which he has acted.
For a &s;hort time the world may be deceiv|ed;
but after a man has continued for a
while to act his part upon the publick
&s;tage, and has been tried by the different
occurrences of life, his real character never
<PB N="402" REF="413">
&s;ails to be di&s;covered. The judgment of
the publick on the character of men, as to
their worth, probity, and honour, &s;eldom
errs. In the mean time, the advantages of
fortune or &s;tation, which the man of the
world has gained, after having been en|joyed
for a while, become in&s;ipid to him;
their fir&s;t reli&s;h is gone, and he has little
more to expect. He finds him&s;elf em|barra&s;&s;ed
with cares and fears. He is &s;en|&s;ible
that by many he is envied and hated;
and though &s;urrounded by low flatterers,
is con&s;cious that he is de&s;titute of real
friends. As he advances in years, all the
enjoyments of his troubled pro&s;perity are
dimini&s;hed more and more, and with many
apprehen&s;ions he looks forward to the de|cline
of life.</P>
<P>Compute now, O wi&s;e man, as thou
art! what thou ha&s;t acquired by all thy
&s;elfi&s;h and intricate wi&s;dom, by all thy re|fined
and double conduct, thy dark and
de&s;igning policy? Can&s;t thou &s;ay that thy
mind is &s;atisfied with thy pa&s;t tenour of
conduct? Has thy real happine&s;s kept pace,
<PB N="403" REF="414">
in any degree, with the &s;ucce&s;s of thy
worldly plans, or the advancement of thy
fortune? Are thy days more cheerful and
gay, or are thy nights more calm and free
of care, than tho&s;e of the plain and upright
man, whom thou ha&s;t &s;o often treated with
&s;corn? To thine own con&s;cience I appeal,
whether thou dare&s;t &s;ay, that ought which
thou ha&s;t gained by the wi&s;dom of the
world, be a &s;ufficient compen&s;ation for in|curring
the di&s;plea&s;ure of thy Creator, for
forfeiting &s;elf-approbation within thy brea&s;t,
for lo&s;ing the e&s;teem of the wi&s;e&s;t and

<P>FROM what has been &s;aid of the nature

to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits,
without partiality, and without bypocri&s;y</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">James, iii. 15. 17.</NOTE>.&mdash;This,
and this only, is $word$ wi&s;dom,
which it is both our duty and our intere&s;t
to cultivate. It carries every character of
being far &s;uperior to the wi&s;dom of the
world. It is ma&s;culine and generous; it
is magnanimous and brave; it is uniform
and con&s;i&s;tent. The wi&s;e man of the
world is obliged to &s;hape and form his
cour&s;e according to the changing occur|rences
of the world; he is un&s;teady and
perplexed; he trembles at every po&s;&s;ible
con&s;equence, and is ever looking to fu|turity
with a troubled mind. But the wi&s;e
man in God's &s;ight, moves in a higher
&s;phere. His integrity directs his cour&s;e
without perplexity or trouble. He en|quires
only what is right, becoming, and
honourable for him to do. Being &s;atisfied
<PB N="405" REF="416">
as to this, he a&s;ks no farther que&s;tions.
The i&s;&s;ue it is not in his power to direct;
but the part which is a&s;&s;igned to him,
he will act; &s;ecure, that come what will,
in life and $word$, the Providence of that
God $word$ &s;erves, will effectually
guard all his great intere$ts. At the &s;ame
time, the &s;pirit of this wi&s;dom is per|fectly
con&s;i&s;tent with proper fore&s;ight,
and vigilant attention. It is oppo&s;ed to
art and cunning, not to prudence and
caution. It is the mark, not of a weak
and improvident, but of a great and noble
mind; which will in no event take re|fuge
in fal&s;ehood and di&s;&s;imulation; which
&s;corns deceit, becau&s;e it holds it to be
mean and ba&s;e; and &s;$$ks no di&s;gui&s;e,
becau&s;e it needs none to hide it.&mdash;Such
a character is both amiable and vene|rable.
While it ennobles the magi&s;trate
and the judge, and adds honour and
dignity to the mo&s;t exalted &s;tations, it
commands re&s;pect in every rank of life.
When the memory of artful and crooked

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MANY devices there are,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XVIII.</NOTE> and much
exerci&s;e of thought and coun&s;el ever
going on among mankind. When we look
abroad into the world, we behold a very
bu&s;y and active &s;cene; a great multitude
always in motion, actuated by a variety of
pa&s;&s;ions, and engaged in the pro&s;ecution
of many different de&s;igns, where they
<PB N="408" REF="419">
commonly flatter them&s;elves with the
pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. But, much of this
labour we behold at the &s;ame time falling
to the ground. <HI>The race is far from being
always to the &s;wi&s;t, or the battle to the
&s;trong, or riches to men of under&s;tanding.</HI>
It plainly appears, that the efforts of our
activity, how great &s;oever they may be, are
&s;ubject to the control of a &s;uperiour in|vi&s;ible
power; to that Providence of Heaven
which works by &s;ecret and imperceptible,
but irre&s;i&s;tible means. Higher coun&s;els than
ours, are concerned in the i&s;&s;ues of human
conduct. Deeper and more exten&s;ive plans,
of which nothing is known to us, are car|ried
on above. The line is let out, to al|low
us to run a certain length; but by that
line we are all the while invi&s;ibly held, and
are recalled and checked at the plea&s;ure of
Heaven.&mdash;Such being now the condition
of man on earth, let us con&s;ider what in|&s;truction
this &s;tate of things is fitted to afford
us. I &s;hall fir&s;t illu&s;trate a little farther the
po&s;ition in the text, that though a <HI>man's heart
may devi&s;e his way, it is the Lord who directeth
<PB N="409" REF="420">
his &s;teps;</HI> and then point out the practical
improvement to be made of this doctrine.</P>
<P>AMONG all who admit the exi&s;tence of a
Deity, it has been a general belief that he
exerci&s;es &s;ome government over human
affairs. It appeared al$ogether contrary to
rea&s;on, to &s;uppo&s;e that after God had erect|ed
this &s;tupendous fabri$k of the univer&s;e,
had beautified it with &s;o much ornament,
and peopled it with &s;uch a multitude of ra|tional
beings, he &s;hould then have thrown
it out from his care, as a de&s;pi&s;ed, neglected
offspring, and allowed its affairs to float
about at random. There was indeed one &s;et
of ancient philo&s;ophers who adopted this
ab&s;urd opinion; but though they nominally
allowed the exi&s;tence of &s;ome beings whom
they called gods, yet as they a&s;cribed to
them neither the creation nor the govern|ment
of the world, they were held to be in
reality Athei&s;ts.</P>
<P>In what manner Providence interpo&s;es in
human affairs; by what means it influences
the thoughts and coun&s;els of men, and,
<PB N="410" REF="421">
notwith&s;tanding the influence it exerts,
leaves to them the freedom of will and
choice, are &s;ubjects of dark and my&s;te|rious
nature, and which have given occa|&s;ion
to many an intricate controver&s;y. Let
us remember, that the manner in which
God influences the motion of all the hea|venly
bodies, the nature of that &s;ecret
power by which he is ever directing the &s;un
and the moon, the planets, &s;tars, and comets,
in their cour&s;e through the heavens, while
they appear to move them&s;elves in a free
cour&s;e, are matters no le&s;s inexplicable to
us, than the manner in which he influences
the coun&s;els of men. But though the
mode of divine operation remains un|known,
the fact of an overruling influence
is equally certain in the moral, as it is in the
natural world. In ca&s;es where the fact is
clearly authenticated, we are not at liberty
to call its truth in que&s;tion, merely becau&s;e
we under&s;tand not the manner in which it
is brought about. Nothing can be more
clear from the te&s;timony of Scripture, than
that God takes part in all that happens
<PB N="411" REF="422">
among mankind; directing and overruling
the whole cour&s;e of events &s;o as to make
every one of them an&s;wer the de&s;igns of
his wi&s;e and righteous government. This
is di&s;tinctly and explicitly a&s;&s;erted in the
text. Throughout all the &s;acred writings,
God is repre&s;ented as on every occa&s;ion,
by various di&s;pen&s;ations of his Providence,
rewarding the righteous, or cha&s;tening
them according as his wi&s;dom requires,
and puni&s;hing the wicked. We cannot
indeed conceive God acting as the gover|nor
of the world at all, unle&s;s his govern|ment
were to extend to all the events that
happen. It is upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of a
particular Providence, that our wor&s;hip
and prayers to him are founded. All his
perfections would be utterly in&s;ignificant to
us, if they were not exerci&s;ed on every oc|ca&s;ion,
according as the circum&s;tances of
his creatures required. The Almighty
would then be no more than an uncon|cerned
&s;pectator of the behaviour of his
&s;ubjects, regarding the obedient and the re|bellious
with an equal eye.</P>
<P><PB N="412" REF="423">
It were needle&s;s to pro&s;ecute any farther
the argument in favour of a particular Provi|dence.
The experience of every one mu&s;t,
more or le&s;s, bear te&s;timony to it. We
need not for this purpo&s;e have recour&s;e to
tho&s;e &s;udden and unexpected vici&s;&s;itudes,
which have &s;ometimes a&s;toni&s;hed whole na|tions,
and drawn their attention to the con|&s;picuous
hand of Heaven. We need not
appeal to the hi&s;tory of the &s;tate&s;man and
the warrior; of the ambitious and the en|terprizing.
We confine our ob&s;ervation
to tho&s;e who&s;e lives have been mo&s;t plain
and &s;imple, and who had no de&s;ire to de|part
from the ordinary train of conduct.&mdash;
In how many in&s;tances, my friends, have
you found, that you are held in &s;ubjection
to a higher Power, on whom depends the
accompli&s;hment of your wi&s;hes and de|&s;igns?
Fondly you had projected &s;ome fa|vourite
plan. You thought that you had
foreca&s;t, and provided for all that might
happen. You had taken your mea&s;ures
with &s;uch vigilant prudence, that on every
&s;ide you &s;eemed to your&s;elf perfectly guarded
<PB N="413" REF="424">
and &s;ecure. But, lo! &s;ome little event
hath come about, unfore&s;een by you, and
in its con&s;equences, at the fir&s;t &s;eemingly
incon&s;iderable, which yet hath turned the
whole cour&s;e of things into a new direc|tion,
and bla&s;ted all your hopes. At other
times, your coun&s;els and plans have been
permitted to &s;ucceed. You then a$plauded
your own wi&s;dom, and &s;at down to fea&s;t
on the happine&s;s you had attained. To
your &s;urpri&s;e you found, that happine&s;s was
not there; and that God's decree had ap|pointed
it to be only vanity. We labour
for pro&s;perity, and obtain it not. Unex|pected,
it i$ &s;ometimes made to drop upon
us, as of its own accord. The happine&s;s
of man depends on &s;ecret &s;prings, too nice
and delicate to be adju&s;ted by human art.
It requires a favourable combination of
external circum&s;tances with the &s;tate of his
own mind. To accompli&s;h on every oc|ca&s;ion
&s;uch a combination, is far beyond
his power; but it is what God can at all
times effect; as the whole &s;eries of exter|nal
cau&s;es are arranged according to his
<PB N="414" REF="425">
plea&s;ure, and the hearts of all men are in
his hands, <HI>to turn them where&s;oever be wills,
as rivers of water.</HI> From the imperfection,
of our knowledge to a&s;certain what is
good for us, and from the defect of our
power to bring about that good when,
known, ari&s;e all tho&s;e di&s;appointments
which continually te&s;tify, that the <HI>way of
man is not in him&s;elf;</HI> that he is not the
ma&s;ter of his own lot, that though he
may <HI>devi&s;e,</HI> it is God who <HI>directs;</HI> God,
who can make the &s;malle&s;t incident an ef|fectual
in&s;trumcnt of his Providence for
overturning the mo&s;t laboured plans of
men.</P>
<P>Accident, and chance, and fortune, are
words which we often hear mentioned,
and much is a&s;cribed to them in the life of
man. But they are words without mean|ing;
or, is far as they have any &s;igni|fication,
they are no other than names for
the unknown operations of Providence.
For it is certain, that in God's univer&s;e
nothing comes to pa&s;s cau&s;ele&s;sly, or in
vain. Every event has its own determined
<PB N="415" REF="426">
direction. That chaos of human affairs
and intrigues, where we can &s;ee no light;
that ma&s;s of di&s;order and confu&s;ion which
they often pre&s;ent to our view, is all clear|ne&s;s
and order in the &s;ight of Him who is
governing and directing all, and bringing
forward every event in its due time and
place. <HI>The Lord &s;itteth on the flood. The
Lord maketh the wrath of man to prai&s;e
him,</HI> as he maketh the <HI>hail and the rain
obey his word. He hath prepared his throne
in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over
all. A mans heart devi&s;eth his way, but the
Lord directeth his &s;teps.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING illu&s;trated the doctrine of the
text, I proceed to &s;how how it is to be
improved by us. I mu&s;t begin with warn|ing
you, that the doctrine I have illu&s;|trated
has no tendency to &s;uper&s;ede coun|&s;el,
de&s;ign, or a proper exertion of the
active powers of man. Becau&s;e Providence
is &s;uperiour to us, it does not follow that
therefore man has no part to act; or be|cau&s;e
our indu&s;try is &s;ometimes di&s;appoint|ed,
<PB N="416" REF="427">
that therefore it is always vain. It is
by the u&s;e of ordinary means, that Provi|dence,
for the mo&s;t part, accompli&s;hes its
de&s;igns, Man <HI>devi&s;ing his own way,</HI> and
carrying on his own plans, has a place in
the order of means which Providence em|ploys.
To exertions therefore of his own,
he is called by God. His Maker framed
him for action; and then only he is happy,
when in action he is properly employed.
To &s;upine idlene&s;s, to a vain and pre&s;ump|tuous
tru&s;t in Providence, while we neglect
what is incumbent on us to perform, no
encouragement is given in Scripture; on
the contrary, threatenings are denounced
again&s;t it. But the doctrine of the text is to
be improved,</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, for correcting anxious
and immoderate care about the future
events of our life. This anxiety is the
&s;ource of much &s;in, and therefore is often
rebuked in Scripture, as alienating the mind
from God, and from the higher objects of
virtue and religion, and filling the heart
<PB N="417" REF="428">
with pa&s;&s;ions which both annoy and cor|rupt
it. If it be the parent of much &s;in,
it is certainly al&s;o the offspring of great
folly. For in &s;uch a &s;tate as human life
has ju&s;t now been repre&s;ented to be, what
means this mighty bu&s;tle and &s;tir, this re&s;t|le&s;s
perturbation of thought and care, as if
all the i&s;&s;ues of futurity re&s;ted wholly on
our conduct?&mdash;Something depends upon
thy&s;elf; and there is rea&s;on, upon this ac|count,
for acting thy part with prudence
and attention. But upon a hand un&s;een it
depends, either to overturn all thy projects,
or to crown them with &s;ucce&s;s; and there|fore,
when the i&s;&s;ue is &s;o uncertain, thine
attention &s;hould never run into immoderate
care. By di&s;quieting thy&s;elf &s;o much
about futurity, thou take&s;t upon thy &s;houl|ders
a lead which is net thine, and which
indeed thou art unable to bear.</P>
<P>The folly of &s;uch anxiety is aggravated
by this con&s;ideration, that ail events are
under a much better and wi&s;er direction
than we could place them. Perhaps that
evil which we hare dreaded &s;o much in
<PB N="418" REF="429">
pro&s;pect, may never be &s;uffered to arrive.
Providence may either have turned into a
quite different cour&s;e, that black cloud
which appeared to carry the &s;torm; or be|fore
the &s;torm bur&s;t, our heads may be
laid &s;o low as to be out of its reach. Per|haps,
al&s;o, the &s;torm may be permitted to
come upon us, and yet under its dark wings
may bring to us &s;ome &s;ecret and unexpected
good. <HI>Who knoweth what is good for man
all the days of his vain life, which he &s;pend|eth
as a &s;hadow?</HI> Who knoweth this, my
brethren, except God? And who con&s;ult|eth
it &s;o effectually as He, who by his in|finite
wi&s;dom <HI>maketh all things work toge|ther
for good to them who love him?</HI> Is it
not, then, our greate&s;t happine&s;s, that when
<HI>man devi&s;eth, God directeth?</HI> Is it not far
ter for us than if the ca&s;e were rever&s;ed;
if the all wi&s;e God were only ineffectually
to devi&s;e, and man, blind, and ignorant,
and ra&s;h as he is, were to have the full di|rection
of his own &s;teps?&mdash;Wherefore vex
not thy&s;elf in vain. To the unavoidable
evils of life, add not this evil of thine own
<PB N="419" REF="430">
procuring, a tormenting anxiety about the
&s;ucce&s;s of thy de&s;igns. The great rule
both of religion and wi&s;dom is, Do thy
duty, and leave the i&s;&s;ue to Heaven.
<HI>Commit thy way unto the Lord.</HI> Act thy
part fairly, and as wi&s;ely as thou can&s;t, for
thine apparent intere&s;t: and then, with a
&s;teady and untroubled mind, wait for what
God &s;hall &s;ee meet to appoint. This is
wi&s;dom: all beyond this is vanity and folly.</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place, the doctrine of the
text is calculated not only to repre&s;s anx|iety,
but to enforce moderation of mind
in every &s;tate; it humbles the pride of
pro&s;perity, and prevents that de&s;pair which
is incident to adver&s;ity.&mdash;The pre&s;umption
of pro&s;perity is the &s;ource both of vices
and mi&s;chiefs innumerable. It renders
men forgetful of God and religion. It in|toxicates
them with the love, and immer&s;es
them in the indulgence of plea&s;ure. It
hardens their hearts to the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of their
brethren. Now, con&s;ider, how little ground
the real &s;ituation of the mo&s;t pro&s;perous
<PB N="420" REF="431">
man affords for this vain elation of mind.
He is dependent every moment on the
plea&s;ure of a &s;uperiour; and knows not, but
Providence may be ju&s;t preparing for him
the mo&s;t unfore&s;een rever&s;es. Shall he <HI>boa&s;t
him&s;elf of to-morrow,</HI> who <HI>knoweth not
what a day may bring forth?</HI> He hath per|haps
&s;aid in his heart, <HI>my mountain &s;tands
&s;trong;</HI> I &s;hall never be moved. But God
needeth only to <HI>hide his face,</HI> and pre&s;ently
<HI>be is troubled.</HI> That little eminence on
which be &s;tood, and from which he &s;ur|veyed
with pride his fellow creatures below
him, was no more than an eminence of
du&s;t. The Almighty blows upon it with
the breath of his mouth, and it is &s;cattered.
Belongs it to him who&s;e tenure of pro&s;|perity
is &s;o in&s;ecure, to utter the voice of
contempt, or to lift the rod of oppre&s;&s;ion
over his fellows, when over his own head
is &s;tretched that high arm of Heaven, which
levels, at one touch, the mighty with the
low?</P>
<P>The government of God is accompanied
with this &s;ignal advantage, that at once it
<PB N="421" REF="432">
humbles the proud, and revives the di&s;tre&s;&s;|ed.
As long as we believe in one higher
than the highe&s;t, to whom all mu&s;t look up,
the greate&s;t man is taught to be mode&s;t,
and to feel his dependence; and the lowe&s;t
man has an object of continual re&s;ource
and hope. Injured by men, he can fly to
that righteous governour who rules the
earth, and, from his interpo&s;ition, hope for
better days. Providence is the great &s;anc|tuary
to the afflicted who maintain their
integrity. Con&s;olation they always find in
the belief of it; and often there has i&s;&s;ued
from this &s;anctuary the mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onable re|lief.
There i&s;&s;ues from it, at all times, this
voice of comfort; <HI>Tru&s;t in the Lord and do
good; and &s;o thou &s;halt dwell in the Land, and
verily thou &s;halt be fed</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm xxxvii. 3.</NOTE>. Thine enemies
may con&s;pire; <HI>the Heathen may rage, and the
people imagine a vain thing. $ut he that
&s;itteth in the heavens &s;hall laugh; the Lord
&s;hall hold them in deri&s;ion.</HI> For the Lord is
<HI>the keeper of I&s;rael;</HI> he is the <HI>&s;hield of the
<PB N="422" REF="433">
righteous. As the mountains are round about
Jeru&s;alem, &s;o the Lord is round about his
people from henceforth and for ever</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm. cxxv. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the third place, the doctrine that has
been illu&s;trated of the interpo&s;al of Provi|dence
in all human affairs, places the vanity
and folly of all &s;inful plans in a very &s;trong
light.&mdash;All &s;in, in every view of it, mu&s;t
be attended with danger. He who em|barks
in any unju&s;t or criminal enterprize,
be&s;ides the manife&s;t peril to his own &s;oul,
incurs the ri&s;que of his character being di&s;|covered,
and of meeting with hatred, con|tempt,
and ju&s;t re&s;entment from the world.
One would think that when the con&s;e|quences
on one &s;ide are &s;o dangerous, the
bribe on the other &s;ide mu&s;t be very high,
and the pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s very fair and
promi&s;ing. Now, con&s;ider how this mat|ter
truly &s;tands. The &s;inner hath again&s;t
him, $ir&s;t, that general uncertainty which I
before &s;hewed to take place in all the de|&s;igns
<PB N="423" REF="434">
and projects formed by men. Could
the mo&s;t artful and be&s;t devi&s;ed means al|ways
en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s to the end we &s;ought to
obtain, &s;ome apology might then be made
for departing occa&s;ionally from the path of
rectitude. But it is far from being true,
that any &s;uch road to &s;ure &s;ucce&s;s can, on
any occa&s;ion, be found. On the contrary,
we every day &s;ee the mo&s;t plau&s;ible and
be&s;t concerted plans baffled and thrown to
the ground; and there is nothing which
on many occa&s;ions has been more remarked,
than Providence &s;eeming to make &s;port of
the wi&s;dom of man.</P>
<P>This view of things alone were &s;ufficient
to &s;how to the &s;inner the in&s;ecurity and
danger of the &s;y&s;tem on which he acts.
But there is much more again&s;t him than
this. For he, by his guilty plans, hath en|gaged
again&s;t him&s;elf one certain and mo&s;t
formidable enemy, to whom he hath great
rea&s;on to look up with terror. He cannot
po&s;&s;ibly believe that the righteous Gover|nour
of the univer&s;e, beholds with an equal
eye the de&s;igns of the virtuous who honour
<PB N="424" REF="435">
him, and the de&s;igns of the guilty who de|&s;pi&s;e
his laws, and do inju&s;tice to his &s;er|vants.
No; again&s;t the&s;e latter, Providence
hath pointed its darts, hath bent its bow
in the heavens; <HI>the face of the Lord is
again&s;t them that do evil</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm. xxxiv. 16.</NOTE>. Other de&s;igns
may fail; but tho&s;e of the wicked, God is
concerned in overthrowing. It is true, that
this life is not the &s;ea&s;on of rendering to
every man according to his works. But
though retribution does not on every occa|&s;ion
take place at pre&s;ent, yet neither is the
exerci&s;e of divine ju&s;tice always delayed.
The hi&s;tory of the world is continually fur|ni&s;hing
us with examples of the wicked
<HI>taken in their own devices;</HI> of the crafty
<HI>&s;nared in the works of their own hands;</HI> of
&s;inners <HI>falling into the pit which them&s;elves
bad digged.</HI> How often when &s;ignal crimes
were ready to be perpetrated, hath God re|markably
interpo&s;ed; hath &s;pread his &s;hield
before the ju&s;t, unnerved the arm of the
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, or &s;truck a &s;udden damp into his
<PB N="425" REF="436">
mind at the critical moment?&mdash;Obnoxious
then as the &s;inner is to &s;o many dangers;
expo&s;ed perpetually to the di&s;appointment
of his de&s;igns by the uncertainty of human
events; expo&s;ed, over and above, to the
avenging interpo&s;ition of Heaven; what
&s;trange in&s;atuation has tempted him to de|part
from the plain and &s;afe path of inte|grity?</P>
<P>IN the la&s;t place, from all that has been
&s;aid on this &s;ubject, we clearly &s;ee how
much it concerns us to perform tho&s;e duties
which a proper regard to Providence re|quires,
and to obtain protection from that
power which directeth and di&s;po&s;eth all.
A more incontrovertible axiom there can|not
be than this, that if man only devi&s;eth
his way, while God overrules his devices
and directs his &s;teps, an intere&s;t in God's
favour is far more important than all the
wi&s;dom and ability of man. Without his
favour, the wi&s;e&s;t will be di&s;appointed and
baffled; under his protection and guid|ance,
the &s;imple are led in a plain and &s;ure
<PB N="426" REF="437">
path.&mdash;In vain would the giddy and pro|fane,
throw Providence out of their
thoughts, and affect to think and act, as
if all depended on them&s;elves. This bold|ne&s;s
of &s;elf-&s;ufficiency is affectation, and
no more. For, moments there are, when
the man of &s;toute&s;t heart feels the &s;trong
&s;ubjection under which he is held, and
would gladly gra&s;p at the aid of Heaven.
As long as human affairs proceed in a
&s;mooth train, without any alarming pre|&s;ages
of change or danger, the man of the
world may remain plea&s;ed with him&s;elf,
and be fully confident in his own powers.
But who&s;e life continues long &s;o undi&s;|turbed?
Let any uncommon violence &s;hake
the elements around him, and threaten him
with de&s;truction; let the a&s;pect of publick
affairs be &s;o lowering as to forebode &s;ome
great calamity; or in his private concerns,
let &s;ome &s;udden change arrive to &s;hatter his
fortune, or let &s;ickne&s;s, and the harbingers
of approaching death, &s;how him his frailty;
and how ready will he then be to &s;end up
prayers from the heart, that Providence
<PB N="427" REF="438">
would befriend and relieve him? Religion,
my friends, is not a matter of theory and
doubt. Its foundations are laid deep in the
nature and condition of man. It lays hold
of every man's feelings. In every man's
heart and con&s;cience it has many witne&s;&s;es
to its importance and reality.</P>
<P>Let us then neglect no means which may
be of avail for procuring the grace and fa|vour
of that divine Providence on which
&s;o much depends. Let no duties be over|looked
which belong to us as &s;ubjects of
God; devout wor&s;hip, and grateful prai&s;es
for all his ble&s;&s;ings; humble tru&s;t in his
goodne&s;s, and implicit &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his
will; and con&s;tant and cheerful obedience
to his laws. Let us be thankful that God
hath clearly made known all that he requires
of us in order to be accepted in his &s;ight;
and that not only he has revealed the rule
of duty, but al&s;o hath pointed out to us in
the go&s;pel, the direct method of reconci|liation
with him, through faith in the Lord
Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Providence hath conde&s;cend|ed
to become our in&s;tructor in this great
<PB N="428" REF="439">
article; hath taught us in what way our
&s;ins may be forgiven, our imperfect &s;ervices
be accepted, and an intere&s;t in the divine
grace be attained by means of our Re|deemer.
Inexcu&s;able we mu&s;t be, if all this
offered grace we &s;hall wantonly throw at our
feet. In a world &s;o full of vici&s;&s;itudes and
uncertainty, let us take pains to &s;ecure to our|&s;elves
one re&s;ting place; one habitation that
cannot be moved. By piety and prayer, by
faith, repentance, and a good life, let us &s;eek
the friend&s;hip of the Mo&s;t High; &s;o &s;hall he
who <HI>directeth the &s;teps of man</HI> now, conduct
our path in &s;uch a cour&s;e as &s;hall bring us
in the end to him&s;elf.</P>

<Q>O Thou that heare&s;t prayer, unto Thee

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Supreme Being is repre&s;ented under
many amiable characters in the &s;acred
writings; as the <HI>Father of Mercies,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XIX.</NOTE> the
<HI>God of Love,</HI> the <HI>Author of every good and
perfect gift.</HI> But there is no character
which carries more comfort, or which ren|ders
God &s;o properly the object of con|fidence
and tru&s;t, as this, of his being the
<HI>Hearer of Prayer.</HI> This view of the Al|mighty
accommodates his perfections to
<PB N="430" REF="441">
our nece&s;&s;ities and wants, and in our pre|&s;ent
frail and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;tate affords a con|&s;tant
refuge to which we can fly. <HI>Unto
Thee &s;hall all fle&s;h come.</HI> To Thee, &s;hall an
indigent world look up for the &s;upply of
their wants; to Thee, &s;hall the proude&s;t

to bow; to Thee, &s;hall the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and
afflicted have recour&s;e, as to their la&s;t
relief and hope.</P>
<P>Prayer is a duty e&s;&s;ential to natural re|ligion.
Wherever the light of nature taught
men to acknowledge the being of a God,
to that God al&s;o it directed them to pray.
In the Chri&s;tian revelation great &s;tre&s;s is
laid upon this duty, and great encourage|ment
given to it. Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour not
only &s;et the example him&s;elf, and enjoined
the practice to his followers, but thought it
worthy his expre&s;s in&s;truction to teach them
in what manner to pray, and even to put
words in their mouth. We are a&s;&s;ured
that prayers are not in vain; but that as
<HI>the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous,
&s;o his ears are open to their cry;</HI> that if we
<PB N="431" REF="442">
a&s;k aright, <HI>we &s;hall receive; if we &s;eek, we
&s;hall find; if we knock, it &s;hall be opened to
us.</HI> It is, indeed, hard to &s;ay, whether
prayer is to be mo&s;t properly con&s;idered
as a duty incumbent on all, or as a privilege
allowed to them. But a ble&s;&s;ed circum|&s;tance
it is, that our duty and our privilege
thus concur in one; that we are com|manded
to do what our wants naturally
dictate to be done; even to a&s;k what is
good from God, who <HI>giveth to all men li|berally,
and upbraideth not.</HI>&mdash;In treating of
this &s;ubject, it will be proper to con&s;ider
fir&s;t, the nature and the &s;ubjects of prayer;
next, its proper qualifications; and la&s;tly,
the advantages and ble&s;&s;ings which at|tend
it.</P>
<P>I. THE Nature of Prayer &s;uppo&s;es, in
the fir&s;t place, that we have a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e
of our own wants and mi&s;eries, and of
our dependence on God for relief. To
be &s;uitably impre&s;&s;ed with this &s;en&s;e, we
need only think what our pre&s;ent &s;ituation
is. We live in a world where every
<PB N="432" REF="443">
thing around us is dark and uncertain.
When we look back on the pa&s;t, we
mu&s;t remember that there we have met
with much di&s;appointment and vanity.
When we look forward to the future, all
is unknown. We are liable there to many
dangers which we cannot fore&s;ee; and to
many which we fore&s;ee approaching, yet
know not how to defend our&s;elves again&s;t
them. We are often ignorant what cour&s;e
we can &s;teer with &s;afety; nay, &s;o imperfect
is our own wi&s;dom, and &s;o great the dark|ne&s;s
which covers futurity, that while we
imagine that we are in the road to pro|&s;perity,
we are often ru&s;hing blindly into
the mo&s;t fatal evils.&mdash;Be&s;ides the&s;e con|tingencies
of life, which make us feel &s;o
deeply the nece&s;&s;ity of looking up to &s;ome
more powerful Guide and Protector, there
are other circum&s;tances in our &s;tate which
lead to reflections &s;till more alarming.
We know that we are the &s;ubjects of a
&s;upreme righteous Governour, to whom
we are accountable for our conduct. We
were &s;ent into this world by his appoint|ment,
<PB N="433" REF="444">
and we are removed from it at his
decree. How &s;oon the call for our removal
may be given, none of us know; but this
we profe&s;s to believe, that upon our going
hence we are to be brought into new and
unknown habitations, &s;uitable to our beha|viour
here. Who among&s;t us can &s;ay that
he is perfectly ready to appear before his
Creator and Judge, and to give an account
to him for all the actions of his life? How
much do the be&s;t of us &s;tand in need of
mercy and forgivene&s;s for our offences pa&s;t,
and of direction and a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Heaven
to guide us in our future way? What
rea&s;on to dread that if we be left entirely
to our&s;elves, we will be in the utmo&s;t dan|ger
of departing from virtue and from hap|pine&s;s,
and of leaving life under the di&s;|plea&s;ure
of Him who is to judge us?&mdash;
While with this &s;en&s;e of our imperfections,
our dangers, and our guilt, we come to the
Hearer of prayer, we mu&s;t, in the next
place.</P>
<P>Pray to God, in the belief that with
him there is power which can give us relief,
<PB N="434" REF="445">
and goodne&s;s which will incline him to
give it. Prayer &s;uppo&s;es a full per&s;ua&s;ion
that his Providence rules and governs all;
that through all futurity his eye penetrates;
that there are no events of our life in which
he interpo&s;es not; that he knows the mo&s;t
&s;ecret motions of our hearts; and that to the
hearts of all men he has acce&s;s, by avenues
unknown to us, and can turn them accord|ing
to his plea&s;ure. It &s;uppo&s;es, at the &s;ame
time, a firm confidence in the declarations
he has made in his word, that a plan is
e&s;tabli&s;hed for di&s;pen&s;ing grace to fallen
and guilty mankind, through a great Re|deemer.
It &s;uppo&s;es a humble hope that,
as he <HI>knows our frame and remembers we
are du&s;t,</HI> he will not reject the &s;upplications
of the penitent returning &s;inner; that he
is one who hath no plea&s;ure in our &s;or|rows
and di&s;tre&s;s, but de&s;ires the happine&s;s
of his creatures, and beholds with compla|cency
the humble and &s;incere wor&s;hipper.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e things being &s;uppo&s;ed, this
ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of our own imperfections and
guilt, and this proper impre&s;&s;ion of the
<PB N="435" REF="446">
divine nature, when the &s;oul is in this po&s;|ture
of devotion, breathing forth its &s;or|rows
and its wants before its Creator, and
imploring from him protection and aid,
it cannot but give vent to the high con|ceptions
with which it will then be affected,
of God's &s;upreme perfection. This of
cour&s;e becomes the foundation of that part
of devotion which is &s;tyled adoration or
prai&s;e.&mdash;As it is the experience of pa&s;t
goodne&s;s which warms the heart of the
wor&s;hipper, and encourages his pre&s;ent
&s;upplication, he will naturally be led to
a grateful celebration of the mercies of
Heaven; whence thank&s;giving becomes an
e&s;&s;ential part of his devotion.&mdash;As he cannot
put up petitions without acknowledging
his wants, and as his wants are clo&s;ely con|nected
with his frailty and ill-de&s;erving,
hence the mo&s;t humble confe&s;&s;ion of guilt
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily enter into prayer.&mdash;If
there be any terms on which we may ex|pect
the Deity to be mo&s;t propitious; if
there be any meritorious Interce&s;&s;or through
whom we may prefer our reque&s;t to him,
<PB N="436" REF="447">
this a&s;&s;uredly will be the method which the
pious wor&s;hipper will choo&s;e for addre&s;&s;ing
the Almighty; and this will be the ground
of his praying in the name of Chri&s;t, &s;end|ing
up his petitions to God through his be|loved
Son, whom he heareth always.</P>
<P>Thus it appears that there is a ju&s;t found|ation
for prayer in all its parts, naturally
laid in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of man,
and in the relation in which he &s;tands to
God. But as petition is the chief and
mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing part of prayer, it will
be requi&s;ite that we con&s;ider particularly
what tho&s;e reque&s;ts are, which are proper
to be offered up to God. The&s;e way all
be cla&s;&s;ed under three heads: fir&s;t, reque&s;ts
for temporal ble&s;&s;ings; next, for &s;piritual
mercies; and la&s;tly, interce&s;&s;ions for the
welfare of others.</P>
<P>WITH regard to temporal ble&s;&s;ings,
though men may lay a re&s;traint upon them|&s;elves
in the expre&s;&s;ions which they utter in
prayer, yet it is much to be &s;u&s;pected, that
the inward wi&s;hes of their hearts for &s;uch
<PB N="437" REF="448">
ble&s;&s;ings are often the mo&s;t fervent of any.
To wi&s;h and pray for the advantages of
life, is not forbidden. Our Saviour hath
&s;o far countenanced it, as to command
us to pray that God would <HI>give us our
daily bread;</HI> that is, as his words have
been always under&s;tood, that he would
be&s;tow what is nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;u&s;tenance
and comfort of life. Yet the very &s;ound
of the words retrenches every &s;uperfluous
and extravagant wi&s;h. Not for riches and
honours, for great advancement or long
life, or for numerous and flouri&s;hing fa|milies,
has he given us any encourage|ment
to pray. Foreign are &s;uch things to
the real improvement, foreign very often
to the true happine&s;s of man. Fooli&s;hly
they may be wi&s;hed for, when the wi&s;h
accompli&s;hed would prove our ruin. Let
health and peace, contentment and tran|quillity.
bound the humble prayer which
we &s;end up to Heaven; that God may <HI>feed
us with food convenient for us;</HI> that what|ever
our outward circum&s;tances are, they
may be ble&s;&s;ed to us by him, and accom|panied
<PB N="438" REF="449">
with a quiet mind. Even health
and peace them&s;elves may not always prove
ble&s;&s;ings. Sweet and de&s;irable as they
&s;eem, God may, at certain times, fore&s;ee
their tendency to corrupt our hearts, and
may, in mercy, reject a prayer for them,
which, on our part, may be allowably put
up. For the nature of all temporal things
is &s;uch, that they have not one fixed and
&s;table character, but may be convertible on
different occa&s;ions either into good or ill;
and therefore, &s;ome re&s;erve in our wi&s;h
mu&s;t always be maintained; and to the
wi&s;er judgment of God, it mu&s;t be left to
determine what is fit to be be&s;towed, and
what to be withheld.&mdash;But this we may
lawfully pray, that, as far as to God &s;eems
meet, he would make our &s;tate comfortable,
and our days ea&s;y and tranquil; that he
would &s;ave us from falling into any &s;evere
and extreme di&s;tre&s;s; that he would pre|&s;erve
to us the enjoyment of tho&s;e friends
and comforts that we mo&s;t love; or if he
bereave us of any of them, that he would
in mercy a&s;&s;i&s;t and &s;upport us under the
<PB N="439" REF="450">
lo&s;s; in fine, that he would &s;o order our
lot, that we may be kept as free from pain,
trouble, and angui&s;h, as &s;hall be con&s;i&s;tent
with the higher improvements of our &s;ouls,
in piety, virtue, and wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>IN the next place, with regard to &s;pi|ritual
mercies, we are unque&s;tionably al|lowed
to be more &s;ervent and explicit in
our reque&s;ts at the throne of grace. God
can never be di&s;plea&s;ed in hearing us im|plore
from him tho&s;e graces and endow|ments
of the &s;oul, that beautify us in his
&s;ight, that are good for all men, good at
all times, indeed the only certain and im|mutable
goods; and therefore to the&s;e only
pertains that earne&s;tne&s;s, that urgency of
prayer, which is repre&s;ented as acceptable
to the Almighty&mdash;Our petitions of this
nature, our Saviour has ranked under the
two great heads, of forgivene&s;s for pa&s;t
offences, and deliverance from future tempt|ations.
It is chiefly for the&s;e important
ble&s;&s;ings, that we are to pro&s;trate our&s;elves
before our Father in Heaven; begging of
<PB N="440" REF="451">
him, who knows our heart with all its
frailties, that he would accept our &s;incere
repentance, and pardon our errors for the
&s;ake of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. We mu&s;t earne&s;tly
pray, that he would &s;trengthen us by his
grace to re&s;i&s;t the temptations that here|after
may a&s;&s;ault us; and whatever he
appoint to befal us without, may enable
us to pre&s;erve a good con&s;cience within;
that he may teach us to know our&s;elves,
and a&s;&s;i&s;t us to control and govern our
pa&s;&s;ions; that he may endow us with
temperance in pro&s;perity, and re&s;ignation
under adver&s;ity; that in no &s;ituation of life
we may be allowed to forget what we owe
to our Maker and Redeemer; and that
after having di&s;charged the duties of life,
through the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Divine grace,
with &s;ome mea&s;ure of integrity and ho|nour,
we may be prepared for going
through the la&s;t &s;cene of life without di&s;|may;
and when we have made a decent
and peaceful retreat from this world, we
may then find our&s;elves in &s;ome better and
happier &s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="441" REF="452">
IN the la&s;t place, it is to be remembered
that interce$$ions for the welfare of others
form a material part of prayer. The
&s;incere wor&s;hipper is not to con&s;ider him|&s;elf
as a &s;ingle and &s;eparate being, con|fining
his concern wholly to him&s;elf. Our
Saviour has initiated us into a more noble
and enlarged &s;pirit of devotion, when he
taught us to begin with praying that the
kingdom of God may be advanced over
all, and that mankind may be rendered as
happy by doing his will, as the angels are
in Heaven. When we bow our knee to
the common Father, let it be like affec|tionate
members of his family, de&s;iring the
pro&s;perity of all our brethren. In parti|cular,
the happine&s;s of our friends and re|lations,
of tho&s;e whom we love, and by
whom we are loved, ought then to be near
our heart; praying that the Almighty may
be our God, and the God of our friends
and family, for ever; that he may watch
over them, and ble&s;s them; and may make
us long happy in mutual comfort and
affection. We ought to remember our
<PB N="442" REF="453">
benefactors before God, and pray for a
return of divine ble&s;&s;ings on their head.
The di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and a$$licted ought to &s;hare
our &s;ympathy; remembering them <HI>who
&s;uffer adver&s;ity, as being our&s;elves in the
body;</HI> and &s;hedding the friendly tear at the
thought of human woe. Our enemies
them&s;elves ought not to be forgotten in
our prayers: in fine, our prayers ought to
be an exerci&s;e of exten&s;ive benevolence of
heart; a &s;olemn te&s;timony offered up to
the God of Love, of our kind and charit|able
affection to all men.</P>
<P>BUT now, after what has been &s;ugge&s;ted
concerning the proper &s;ubjects of prayer,
I am aware that it may be &s;aid by &s;ome,
To what purpo&s;e is all this detail?&mdash;Do
we propo&s;e, by our prayers, to give to the
Supreme Being any new information, re|garding
our &s;ituation, of which be is not
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed? Does He not already know all
our wants and di&s;tre&s;&s;es; and will He not
be prompted by his goodne&s;s and wi&s;dom to
do for us in &s;uch circum&s;tances, whatever
<PB N="443" REF="454">
is fit and proper to be done? Do we
imagine that, by the importunity of our
folicitations and reque&s;ts, He can be pre|vailed
upon to alter his purpo&s;e, or depart
from his &s;y&s;tem in the government of the
world, in order to gratify our de&s;ires?&mdash;
Such objections again&s;t the rea&s;onablene&s;s
of prayer, have been often urged with all
the parade of &s;ceptici&s;m. Though, on the
fir&s;t view, they may carry &s;ome appearance
of &s;peciou&s;ne&s;s, yet on a &s;light di&s;cu&s;&s;ion
they fall to the ground; for they all re&s;t
on a mi&s;taken idea of the nature and
de&s;ign of prayer. No man in his &s;ober
&s;en&s;es could ever believe that, by lifting his
feeble voice to Heaven, he could convey to
the ear of the Almighty any new know|ledge
or information. None but the mo&s;t
ignorant could imagine, that, by his prayers
he could rai&s;e any new emotions in the
unchangeable Sovereign of the univer&s;e,
and prevail upon him to alter his decrees
in con&s;equence of his reque&s;ts.&mdash;The
efficacy of prayer lies, not in working a
change upon God, but in working a
<PB N="444" REF="455">
change upon our&s;elves; in begetting or
improving right di&s;po&s;itions of heart, and
thereby making us fit &s;ubjects of the Di|vine
mercy. It is not for the &s;ake of our
a&s;king, that God grants the reque&s;ts we
prefer in prayer; but as our a&s;king, with
proper di&s;po&s;itions, produces that frame of
mind which qualifies us to receive.&mdash;He$ce
prayer has been appointed by God
as an in&s;trument for improving our nature,
and is required on our part as a condition
of receiving his favours. Thus, when
upon a certain occa&s;ion he had by his
Prophet predicted and promi&s;ed circum|&s;tances
of pro&s;perity to the Jewi&s;h nation,
the Prophet was directed to add, <HI>Thus &s;aith
the Lord God, I will yet for this be enquired
of by the hou&s;e of I&s;rael to do it for them</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Ezekil, xxxvi. 37.</NOTE>.
&mdash;Is there any one who will &s;ay, that it
is not incumbent on all rational creatures
to feel their dependence on the God who
has formed them, and to refer to him all
the bleffings which they either enjoy or
<PB N="445" REF="456">
hope to receive? Would not the want of
&s;uch becoming &s;entiments be altogether
unworthy and &s;inful? And if they are
&s;uch &s;entiments as ought to be entertained,
mu&s;t it not be proper to expre&s;s them by
words in prayer, and thereby to &s;trengthen
the impre&s;&s;ion of them on our minds?</P>
<P>But in truth there is no occa&s;ion for
entering into any long di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of argu|ment
in order to evince the rea&s;onablene&s;s
of prayer. It is the natural dictate of the
human heart. Though in the days of
pro&s;perity and $a&s;e it may, like other du|ties,
have been neglected and forgotten,
yet on all great and trying occa&s;ions, men
are prompted by an irre$i&s;tible impul&s;e to
lift their eyes, and addre&s;s their voice to
Heaven. Who is there, for in&s;tance, that
feeling him&s;elf cruelly oppre&s;&s;ed by inju&s;|tice
and violence, without any pro&s;pect of
procuring redre&s;$, can forbear appealing to
a Power that rules above, and invoking
Divine interpo&s;ition to vindicate his in|nocence,
and avenge his wrongs? Who
that is &s;tanding by the death-bed of a be|loved
<PB N="446" REF="457">
friend, of a &s;pou&s;e, a brother, or a
&s;on, and &s;ees them &s;truggling with the la&s;t
agonies, but finds him&s;elf impelled to look
up to Heaven, and to pray from the heart,
that where men can give no aid, God
would in his mercy &s;upport the dying
man? Was there ever a &s;inner &s;o hardened,
that when he finds him&s;elf leaving the
world, and &s;tanding on the brink of an
unknown eternity, is not di&s;po&s;ed with
earne&s;t and trembling voice to pray that
God would forgive his errors, and receive
in peace his departing &s;pirit? In &s;uch &s;itua|tions
as the&s;e, man feels what he truly is,
and &s;peaks the native unadulterated lan|guage
of the heart.&mdash;Accordingly,
throughout all ages and nations, the ob|ligation
to prayer as a duty has been re|cogni&s;ed,
and its propriety has been felt.
Over all the world, even among the mo&s;t
&s;avage tribes, temples have been built,
wor&s;hippers have a&s;&s;embled in crowds;
and the wilde&s;t &s;uper&s;tition has, by the
various forms of homage which it adopted,
borne te&s;timony to this truth, that there is
<PB N="447" REF="458">
&s;ome God, to whom, as <HI>the hearer of prayer,
all fle&s;h &s;hould come.</HI></P>
<P>IN order that prayer may produce its
proper effect, there are certain qualifications
nece&s;&s;arily belonging to it, which come next
to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>One of the fir&s;t and chief of the&s;e is &s;e|riou&s;ne&s;s,
or an attentive and &s;olemn frame
of mind, in oppo&s;ition to thoughts that
wander, and to words that drop forth un|meaning
from the lips. One would think
it unnece&s;&s;ary to mention &s;uch a qualifica|tion
to be requi&s;ite, when we are to be em|ployed
in &s;o &s;olemn an act as an immediate
addre&s;s to our Maker. Yet there is ground
to apprehend, that an admonition of this
nature is nece&s;&s;ary to be given to many
profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians. Men from their child|hood
have been &s;o oft accu&s;tomed to repeat
certain expre&s;&s;ions, which they call, &s;aying
prayers, with little under&s;tanding, and le&s;s
attention to what they &s;ay, that the habit
of it is apt to be continued throughout life;
as if the mere uttering of words, or pre|&s;enting
<PB N="448" REF="459">
them&s;elves, at &s;et times, in a certain
po&s;ture before God, had &s;ome charm in it
to attract the ble&s;&s;ings of Heaven.&mdash;My
brethren, this is tri$ling with one of the
mo&s;t important exerci&s;es in which the
human mind can be employed; it is turn|ing
devotion into childi&s;h folly. Let us
never forget that it is the heart which mu&s;t
pray. The heart may pray, when no words
are uttered. But if the heart be not en|gaged
in prayer, all the words we can utter
are no better than rude offen&s;ive &s;ounds in
the ear of the Almighty.&mdash;Collect then thy
mind within it&s;elf, before thou preferre&s;t a
&s;ingle petition; nay, before thou pro|nounce&s;t
the name of God in prayer. Be
alone with him, and thine own &s;oul; under
the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ion as if thou wert ju&s;t
about to appear before the judgment-&s;eat
of that God, to whom thou praye&s;t.</P>
<P>To &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, we mu&s;t join affection
in prayer; I mean that devotion of the heart
which is in&s;pired by gratitude and love, in
di&s;tinction from forced prayer; or what is
unwillingly preferred from &s;ervile fear, or
<PB N="449" REF="460">
mere regard to decency. We mu&s;t come
into the pre&s;ence of God, as to a Father in
heaven; not to a hard and oppre&s;&s;ive
ma&s;ter, to whom we are obliged to pay
obei&s;ance to prevent him from de&s;troying
us.&mdash;Profound humility is perfectly con|&s;i&s;tent
with this affectionate &s;pirit in prayer.
No pre&s;umptuous familiarity mu&s;t enter into
our addre&s;&s;es to God. We are enjoined to
&s;erve him <HI>with reverence and godly fear.</HI>
Our devotion will be moft &s;ervent and
affectionate, when we entertain the humble&s;t
thoughts of our&s;elves, joined with the mo&s;t
exalted conceptions of that God to whom
we pray. <HI>Remember that God is in heaven,
and thou art on earth; therefore let thy
words be few</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. v. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Faith is a qualification of prayer ex|pre&s;sly
required in Scripture. He that
prayeth, &s;ays the Apo&s;tle James, <HI>let him
a&s;k in faith, nothing wavering</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jame$, i. 6.</NOTE>.&mdash;By faith
in prayer, two things are meant; fir&s;t, a
general per&s;ua&s;ion that God is a Being of
<PB N="450" REF="461">
infinite goodne&s;s and mercy; to whom,
therefore, the prayers of his creatures are
not put up in vain. <HI>He that cometh unto
God mu&s;t believe,</HI> not only that he is, but
that he <HI>is a rewarder of them that diligently
&s;eek him</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Heb. xi. 6.</NOTE>: without &s;ome belief of this kind,
prayers were altogether &s;uperfluous. For
who would &s;end up &s;upplications to a God
who was believed to be$ inacce&s;&s;ible to his
creatures, and to have no regard to their
circum&s;tances and wants?&mdash;At the &s;ame
time, much ground we have to be con&s;cious
of our own unworthine&s;s, and to tremble
at the remembrance of it, when we addre&s;s
our&s;elves to Heaven; and therefore, &s;econdly,
to pray in faith is, in the &s;cripture &s;en&s;e of
it, to pray in the name of Chri&s;t; that is,
in the faith that it is through his merits and
mediation only we can find acceptance
with God. We acknowledge our guilt;
we di&s;claim all tru&s;t in our own righteou&s;|ne&s;s;
and implore grace from God on ac|count
of what his Son has done and &s;uffered
<PB N="451" REF="462">
for us. This is the clear and expre&s;s doc|trine
of the New Te&s;tament. <HI>We have
boldne&s;s to enter into the holie&s;t by the blood
of Je&s;us. We have this new and living
way which he hath con&s;ecrated for us within
the veil. Having this High Prie&s;t over the
hou&s;e of God, let us draw near with a true
heart in full a&s;&s;urance of Faith</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Heb. x. 19&ndash;22.</NOTE></P>
<P>HAVING thus pointed out the chief and
mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential qualifications of prayer, it
remains that I lay &s;ome con&s;iderations be|fore
you, to &s;how the importance and ad|vantages
of it.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, prayer is one of the mo&s;t
powerful means of recalling our minds
from the vanities of life to &s;erious thoughts;
to a proper &s;en&s;e of God, and our duty;
and to all the high objects with which we
are intimately connected as rational and
immortal beings. Surrounded, as we are,
with the objects and plea&s;ures of the world;
bu&s;ied with its avocations, and continually
<PB N="452" REF="463">
immer&s;ed in its pur&s;uits, man would be|come
altogether the victim of &s;en&s;e, and a
prey to its temptations; if there were not
&s;ome &s;tated occa&s;ions which brought him
home to him&s;elf, and to the thoughts of
another world. Prayer has a much more
impre&s;&s;ive effect for this purpo&s;e, than can
be expected from &s;imple meditation. An
immediate and &s;olemn addre&s;s to an omni|&s;cient
Being, in who&s;e pre&s;ence we con&s;ider
our&s;elves as then particularly &s;i&s;ted, tends
to produce a higher degree of &s;erious and
awful recollection, than would ari$e from
a mere &s;oliloquy of the mind with it&s;elf.
In prayer, the &s;oul approaches to the bor|ders
of an invi&s;ible world, and acts as a
&s;pirit holding intercour&s;e with the Father
of Spirits. It drops for a time the remem|brance
of its earthly connections, to dwell
among everla&s;ting objects. Prayer, by this
means, both compo&s;es and purifies the
heart; it gives the &s;oul its proper elevation
towards God, and has a happy effect to
counterwork the dangerous impre&s;&s;ions
made by the corruptions of the world
around us.</P>
<P><PB N="453" REF="464">
IN the next place, Prayer is u&s;eful, not
only as a corrective of our natural levity
and forgetfulne&s;s of God, but as an actual
exerci&s;e of the be&s;t affections of our na|ture,
which are thereby confirmed and
&s;trengthened. As far as prayer is not a
mere emi&s;&s;ion of empty words, but &s;peaks,
as it ought to do, the language of the heart,
it is an a&s;&s;emblage of all the affections
which con&s;titute piety. It implies the
highe&s;t &s;entiments of reverence and ado|ration,
of love and gratitude to God, of
tru&s;t in his mercy, and of faith in our ble&s;&s;ed
Redeemer, all animating the heart. What|ever
nouri&s;hes &s;uch affections as the&s;e in
the &s;oul, gives &s;trength and &s;upport at the
&s;ame time to active virtue; and thereby
prepares and a&s;&s;i&s;ts us for every duty of
life.&mdash;With re&s;pect to our&s;elves, the view
which prayer gives, of our nece&s;&s;ities and
wants, of our &s;ins and offences again&s;t God,
and of the dangers which we have thereby
incurred, produces becoming humility of
mind. Pro&s;trate before that Great Being
whom we have &s;o much offended, all the
<PB N="454" REF="465">
pride of man is laid in the du&s;t. He is
impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of what he truly is,
and taught how far removed from what he
ought to be. By the prayers he puts up
for being a&s;&s;i&s;ted to repent of pa&s;t follies,
and to make improvements for the future
in virtue, the de&s;ire of virtue is cheri&s;hed,
and the pur&s;uit of it excited; and if this
de&s;ire after virtue which is expre&s;&s;ed in
prayer he genuine, it is a degree of good|ne&s;s
already in &s;ome mea&s;ure begun within
the heart.&mdash;Prayer is, at the &s;ame time,
an exerci&s;e of benevolence towards men,
as well as of piety towards God; when,
as was before ob&s;erved, not merely as indi|viduals,
but as members of the great family
of God, we come before our heavenly
Father, and expre&s;s our affectionate wi&s;hes
for all our brethren.&mdash;While prayer in this
manner gives exertion to many of the
highe&s;t parts of goodne&s;s, it is attended
moreover with this great advantage, that it
tends to $ortify the wor&s;hipper in the prac|tice
of all his duties. For it impre&s;&s;es him
with a &s;en&s;e of God as the great friend and
<PB N="455" REF="466">
protector of righteou&s;ne&s;s in the world; to
whom, therefore, all righteous men may
look up with confidence and hope; who&s;e
&s;trength is more than &s;ufficient for their
weakne&s;s; who&s;e gracious aid none that
&s;erved him ever implored in vain.</P>
<P>IN the la&s;t place, Prayer is important,
not only as a means of high improvement
in religion, but as an in&s;trument of con&s;o|lation
and relief under the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of life.
How many &s;ituations are found in the
world, where men have no re&s;ource left to
them but prayer to God? How forlorn
would the per&s;ecuted and afflicted, the &s;ad
and the &s;orrowful be, if even this la&s;t &s;anc|tuary
were &s;hut again&s;t them; if they had
no Protector in heaven to whom they could
look up in the hours of angui&s;h?&mdash;We all
know what a relief it is to be able to un|bo$om
our griefs to &s;ome friend whom we
believe compa&s;&s;ionate and kind, even though
it be not in his power to give us any ef|fectual
aid. In our Heavenly Father we
can look up not only to One in whom <HI>com|pa&s;&s;ions
<PB N="456" REF="467">
flow,</HI> who <HI>knows our frame, remem|bers
we are du&s;t, and pities us as a father
pitieth his children;</HI> but to One who&s;e arm
is all-powerful, either to &s;upport us under
our di&s;tre&s;s, or, if to his wi&s;dom it &s;eem
meet, to relieve us altogether from it.&mdash;
Hence, Prayer is &s;o often the la&s;t retreat
of the mi&s;erable. Where men can give them
no aid, <HI>God is their pre&s;ent help.</HI> To him
they can pour forth tho&s;e &s;ecret griefs, which
to men they &s;ometimes cannot di&s;clo&s;e. He
hears tho&s;e groans of the labouring heart,
which no words can utter; and circum|&s;tances
which would expo&s;e our reque&s;ts to
be de&s;pi&s;ed by the world, prevent not our
prayers from finding acceptance with God.
It is his character to <HI>hear the cry of the
poor, and to regard the prayer of the de&s;ti|tute:</HI>
He is the <HI>helper of them who have no
help of man.</HI>&mdash;Hence, prayer may be
termed the Temple of Tranquillity to the
unhappy; where their minds are &s;oothed,
and their cares and &s;orrows are, for a time,
hu&s;hed and forgotten. It may ju&s;tly be
&s;aid, that there only, on this &s;ide of the
<PB N="457" REF="468">
grave, <HI>the wicked cea&s;e from troubling, and
the weary are at re&s;t. There, the pri&s;oners
re&s;t together; they hear no more the voice of
the oppre&s;&s;or. The &s;mall and the great are
there; and the &s;ervant it free from his
ma&s;ter</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Job, iii. 17&ndash;19.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE rea&s;onablene&s;s of prayer as a duty,
and the advantages attending it, being &s;uch
as I have now endeavoured briefly to &s;et
forth, there is no wonder that &s;o many re|peated
recommendations of it occur in the
&s;acred writings; and that we are enjoined
to be <HI>fervent in prayer,</HI> to be <HI>in&s;tant in
prayer;</HI> nay, to <HI>pray without cea&s;ing.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">$ The&s;&s;. v. 17.</NOTE>&mdash;By
&s;uch precepts I do not under&s;tand that we
are bound to frequent repetitions of long
and tedious prayers. Our Saviour, in his
excellent di&s;cour&s;e on this &s;ubject<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matth. vi.</NOTE>, has &s;uf|ficiently
cautioned us again&s;t the hypocri&s;y
of tho&s;e who <HI>u&s;e vain repetitions, and think
that they &s;hall be heard for their much
&s;peaking.</HI> But be&s;ides the &s;tated times of
<PB N="458" REF="469">
both public and private prayer which we
ought devoutly to ob&s;erve, there is a habit
of devotion, in occa&s;ional elevations of the
&s;oul towards God, which highly de&s;erves
to be cultivated. A thou&s;and occurrences
which happen when we are engaged in the
affairs of the world, and a thou&s;and objects
which pre&s;ent them&s;elves to our view in
the earth and the heavens when we are
&s;olitary and alone, may &s;ugge&s;t matter of
devout ejaculation towards God. By che|ri&s;hing
&s;uch a habit, we pre&s;erve on our
minds the native &s;pirit of prayer. We
correct tho&s;e evil di&s;po&s;itions which inter|cour&s;e
with the world is always apt to in|troduce;
we improve our contemplation
of the objects which &s;urround us, into an
act of devotion; and either from the
crowded city, or the &s;olitary field, can &s;end
up to Heaven that homage of the heart,
which is no le&s;s acceptable to the Almighty,
than if it aro&s;e in vocal form from the mid&s;t
of the temple. In this &s;en&s;e I under&s;tand
the injunction given to <HI>pray without cea&s;ing.</HI>
&mdash;And &s;urely, my brethren, when we
<PB N="459" REF="470">
con&s;ider the high value of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings
for which we depend on Heaven, it mu&s;t
appear to every reflecting mind, that we
cannot be too earne&s;t in our &s;upplications to
obtain them. To what purpo&s;e tend all
our pre&s;ent &s;olicitude and care; all the ap|plication
of the thoughtful, and all the in|du&s;try
of the active and diligent? Is it not
in order to pa&s;s through life, contented,
ea&s;y, and happy? But can you pa&s;s through
life with contentment and happine&s;s, unle&s;s
you enjoy peace within, a good con&s;cience,
and a comfortable hope of a future exi&s;t|ence?
Are not all the&s;e things directly and
immediately the gifts of God, imparted by
him to the &s;ouls of men? And can you
expect to receive &s;uch gifts, unle&s;s you con|fe&s;s
your dependance on Him who be&s;tows
them, and implore them from that gracious
God, who <HI>giveth to all men liberally, and
upbraideth not?</HI></P>

<PB N="461" REF="472">
It adds &s;olemnity to every part of religion;
it introduces an awful &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s into our
thoughts, by placing in the mo&s;t &s;triking
light, the clo&s;e connexion between our
pre&s;ent behaviour and our everla&s;ting
happine&s;s or mi&s;ery. In the Go&s;pel, it is
de&s;cribed with &s;o many circum&s;tances of
awe and terror, as may, to many, render
the con&s;ideration of this &s;ubject dark and
di&s;agreeable. But we mu&s;t remember, that
though religion be often employed to &s;oothe
and comfort the di&s;tre$&s;ed, and though this
be one of its mo&s;t &s;alutary effects, yet this is
not the only purpo&s;e to which it is to be
applied by mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel. In
the mid&s;t of that levity and di&s;&s;ipation
with which the world abounds, it is nece&s;|&s;ary
to awaken the giddy and unthinking,
by &s;etting before them, in full view, all the
dangers they incur by their conduct.&mdash;
<HI>Knowing the terror of the Lord,</HI> adds the
Apo&s;tle in the ver&s;e immediately following
the text, <HI>we per&s;uade men.</HI>&mdash;In treating
of this &s;ubject, I &s;hall, in the fir&s;t place,
&s;tate the arguments which rea&s;on affords
<PB N="462" REF="473">
for the belief of a judgment to come; and
&s;hall next &s;how the improvements which
we ought to make of the particular di&s;|coveries
the Go&s;pel hath made to us con|cerning
it.</P>
<P>I. BY taking a view of the arguments
which rea&s;on affords for the belief of a
general judgment, ou$ faith in the di&s;|coveries
of the Go&s;pel will receive con|firmation,
from di&s;cerning their con&s;onance
with the natural &s;entiments of the human
heart.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, and as the foundation
of all, I begin with ob&s;erving, that there is
in the nature of things a real and eternal
difference between right and wrong, be|tween
a virtuous and an immoral conduct;
a difference which all men di&s;cern of them|&s;elves,
and which leads them unavoidably
to think of &s;ome actions as de&s;erving blame
and puni&s;hment, and of others as worthy
of prai&s;e and reward. If all actions were
conceived as indifferent in their nature, no
<PB N="463" REF="474">
idea of ju&s;tice and retribution would be
found among men; they would not con|&s;ider
them&s;elves as in any view accountable
for their actions to any &s;uperiour. But
this is far from being the ca&s;e. Every man
feels him&s;elf under a law; the law of his
being, which he cannot violate without
being &s;elf-condemned. The mo&s;t ignorant
heathen knows and feels, that when he has
committed an unju&s;t or cruel action, he
has committed a crime, and de&s;erves
puni&s;hment. Never was there a nation on
the face of the earth, among whom there
did not prevail a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that, by in|humanity
and fraud, they ju&s;tly expo&s;ed
them&s;elves to the hatred of tho&s;e around
them, and to the di&s;plea&s;ure of any &s;ecret
invi&s;ible power that ruled the world. This,
therefore, may be a&s;&s;umed as an incontro|vertible
principle, that the difference of
good and evil in actions, is not founded on
arbitrary opinions or in&s;titutions, but in
the nature of things, and the nature of
man; and accords with the univer&s;al &s;en&s;e
of the human kind. This being the ca&s;e,
it is certainly rea&s;onable,</P>
<P><PB N="464" REF="475">
IN the &s;econd place, to think that the
Ruler of the world will make &s;ome di&s;|tinction
among his creatures according to
their actions; and if this di&s;tinction be not
made, or only imperfectly made in this
life, there will be &s;ome future &s;tate of
exi&s;tence in which he will openly reward
and puni&s;h. To &s;uppo&s;e God to be a
mere indifferent &s;pectator of the conduct
of his creatures, regarding with an equal
eye the evil and the good, is in effect to
annihilate his exi&s;tence; as it contradicts
every notion which mankind have enter|tained
of a Supreme Being as ju&s;t and
good. It would repre&s;ent him as inferiour
in character to many of his creatures on
earth; as there is no man of tolerable
virtue and humanity who is not &s;hocked at
the commi&s;&s;ion of atrocious crimes, and
who does not de&s;ire to &s;ee the guilty
puni&s;hed, the innocent protected, and the
virtuous rewarded.&mdash;If there exi&s;t at all
a God who governs the world, (and what
nation has not acknowledged him to exi&s;t?)
as a governour he undoubtedly will act;
and as &s;uch, will, &s;omewhere, and at &s;ome
<PB N="465" REF="476">
period or other, reward and puni&s;h, accord|ing
as his creatures obey, or violate, that
law which he originally implanted in their
hearts.&mdash;Whether this be completely
done in the pre&s;ent world, is not a point
that requires long di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. The expe|rience
of all ages has &s;hown, that pain and
plea&s;ure, pro&s;perity and adver&s;ity, are not
at pre&s;ent di&s;tributed by Providence exactly
according to the mea&s;ure of men's probity
and worth, but are apparently &s;cattered
with a promi&s;cuous hand. Hence the
antient complaint, that <HI>all things come alike
to all men; that there is one event to the
righteous and the wicked; that</HI> to poverty
and di&s;appointment the righteous are often
left, while <HI>the tabernacles of robbers pro&s;per.</HI>
&mdash;An inference from hence might at
fir&s;t view ari&s;e not favourable to the doc|trine
we now &s;upport; but we have to
ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>IN the third place, that although full
retribution be not as yet made to the good
and to the evil, yet plain marks appear of
<PB N="466" REF="477">
a government already begun and carried
on by God in the univer&s;e, though not
fully completed; marks of his favouring
and taking part with virtue, and of his
providing puni&s;hments for vice. This ob|&s;ervation
de&s;erves to be particularly attend|ed
to, as it is one of the chief arguments
for a future judgment.&mdash;In the pre&s;ent
&s;y&s;tem of things, had the righteous been
uniformly happy, and the wicked at all
times mi&s;erable, future judgment might
have appeared unnece&s;&s;ary, as ju&s;tice had
already taken place. On the other hand,
had no di&s;tinction whatever taken place in
the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem between the righteous
and the wicked as to happine&s;s and mi&s;ery,
there might have been ground to &s;u&s;pect
that, &s;ince univer&s;al di&s;order at pre&s;ent
prevailed, di&s;order would ever continue,
and never be rectified by any future judg|ment.
But neither of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions
is founded in fact. The pre&s;ent &s;tate of
the moral world is neither a &s;tate of com|plete
ju&s;tice and order, nor of ab&s;olute
di&s;order, but a &s;tate of order and ju&s;tice
<PB N="467" REF="478">
begun and carried to a certain length,
though left as yet imperfect.&mdash;Ob&s;erve,
my brethren, that in the whole &s;tructure
and con&s;titution of things, God hath &s;hown
him&s;elf to be favourable to virtue, and
inimical to vice and guilt. He hath made
a fixed provi&s;ion for happine&s;s to virtue,
by the powerful recommendation which it
carries to univer&s;al e&s;teem and love; by the
manifold benefits which it procures to &s;o|ciety;
by the health, peace, and comfort of
mind which it brings to the virtuous man.
At the &s;ame time, from the crimes of the
wicked, a multitude of mi&s;eries is made in|fallibly
to &s;pring; lo&s;s of character and
e&s;teem, and of confidence and regard in
&s;ociety; health always impaired by vice;
and all comfortable enjoyment of life di&s;|turbed
by an unea&s;y companion, which the
&s;inner carries about with him in his own
con&s;cience, upbraiding him for his crimes,
and threatening him with the di&s;plea&s;ure of
the Almighty.</P>
<P>The&s;e are not things of ca&s;ual or acci|dental
occurrence, but of univer&s;al expe|rience,
<PB N="468" REF="479">
taking their ri&s;e from the con&s;titu|tion
of our nature, and from the &s;ixed laws
which regulate human events. They &s;how
us what the direct tendency of virtue and
vice is appointed by Providence to be; and
if this tendency be not, in every in&s;tance,
carried into effect, owing to circum&s;tances
which belong to our pre&s;ent &s;tate of proba|tion
and di&s;cipline, yet &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hed
natural tendency carries a &s;ufficient intima|tion
of the will and plea&s;ure of our Creator.
We &s;ee his <HI>throne already &s;et for judgment.</HI>
By his beginning in this world both to
reward and to puni&s;h, we clearly behold
him acting as a governour and a judge,
and are led to progno&s;ticate what cour&s;e he
will hereafter hold. By the con&s;titution
of things which he has fixed here, he has
as plainly &s;ignified that he favours the vir|tuous
and is di&s;plea&s;ed with the wicked, as
if he had declared it to us by a voice from
the clouds.&mdash;Although the pre&s;ent &s;tate of
mankind requires that the ju&s;t &s;hould &s;ome|times
&s;uffer, and the &s;inner be allowed to
pro&s;per, the &s;tronge&s;t pre&s;umption &s;till re|mains
<PB N="469" REF="480">
that there is a period to come, when
God will complete his righteous govern|ment
by making the one fully ble&s;t, and
rendering the other as mi&s;erable as they de|&s;erve
to be; e&s;pecially as we can ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>IN the fourth place, that a &s;atisfactory
account may be given why judgment is at
pre&s;ent po&s;tponed, and complete retribution
not made, either to the good or the bad.
We are to take notice, that even among
men, the wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice of government
do not con&s;i&s;t in immediately rewarding
and puni&s;hing on every occa&s;ion, but in
exerci&s;ing tho&s;e acts of government pub|lickly,
at &s;uch times and with &s;uch circum|&s;tances
as may have the mo&s;t powerful
effect for the benefit of &s;ociety. A &s;imilar
con&s;ideration perfectly accounts for the full
execution of ju&s;tice being delayed by God in
this world; for rewards and puni&s;hments
being only begun here, but left unfini&s;hed.
Were they completed in this world to their
full extent, all the purpo&s;es of a &s;tate of trial
and di&s;cipline would be defeated. No
<PB N="470" REF="481">
room would be left for exerci&s;e and im|provement
to the good in many virtues,
if they were never to under go any trials;
if they felt full reward immediately con|ferred
on every righteous action they per|formed,
and &s;aw the wicked in&s;tantly cut
off, as &s;oon as a crime was committed.
For &s;alutary di&s;cipline, therefore, to the
good, in order to improve their virtues; and
from patience to the bad, in order to give
them room for repentance, it was $it and
wi&s;e that final judgment &s;hould at pre&s;ent
be po&s;tponed. Divine ju&s;tice &s;tands for a
while, as behind the veil, and leaves men
at full &s;cope to act according to their dif|ferent
di&s;po&s;itions, that their real characters
may be fully di&s;played; the $idelity of the
upright be tried and proved, and the ob&s;ti|nately
wicked left without excu&s;e.&mdash;The
delay of judgment, therefore, and the &s;eem|ing
inequality that now takes place in the
ways of Providence, is &s;o far from forming
any ground of &s;u&s;picion that judgment
will never come, that, on the contrary, it is
an argument of the wi&s;dom of the divine
<PB N="471" REF="482">
government, and nece&s;&s;arily enters into the
plans it is now carrying forward.</P>
<P>Such are the pre&s;umptions which rea&s;on
furni&s;hes, for rendering it more than pro|bable
that, at the conclu&s;ion of human things,
God will <HI>render to every one according to
his works.</HI> They may &s;erve to &s;trengthen
our faith; but on mere rea&s;onings our
faith re&s;ts not. God in his mercy has given
us &s;urer light in an article of &s;o great im|portance.
To the con&s;ideration, therefore,
of the di&s;coveries which the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t
hath made to us, we now proceed.</P>
<P>II. You all know how often we are
a&s;&s;ured in the New Te&s;tament, that God
hath <HI>appointed a day in which he will judge
the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> a day and an
hour which no man knoweth, but which
is fixed in the coun&s;els of Heaven. In the
&s;acred writings a very particular account is
given us of the whole procedure of that
&s;olemn day, accompanied with an a&s;&s;em|blage
of circum&s;tances of the mo&s;t awful
and terrifick nature. The &s;cene is &s;uch as
<PB N="472" REF="483">
forbids all attempts to heighten, or even to
do it ju&s;tice by human de&s;cription. Be|neath
&s;uch a &s;ubject all imagination &s;inks.
The efforts of the declaimer or the poet
are here alike in vain.&mdash;We are in|formed
that the la&s;t day &s;hall be u&s;hered in
by <HI>&s;igns in the &s;un, and &s;igns in the moon and
&s;tars; upon the earth, di&s;tre&s;s of nations with
perplexity; the &s;ea and the waves roaring;
men's hearts failing them for fear, and for
looking after the things which are coming on
the earth, for the powers of Heaven &s;hall be
&s;haken. The &s;ound of a trumpet &s;hall be
heard, at which the dead &s;hall ri&s;e out of
their graves. The &s;ign of the Son of Man
&s;hall appear. He &s;hall come in a cloud with
power and great glory, and all the holy An|gels
with him. A great white throne &s;hall
be &s;et, and He &s;hall &s;it thereon in his glory.
Before Him &s;hall be gathered all nations.
Books &s;hall be opened, and the dead &s;hall be
judged out of the things which are found
written in the books. He &s;hall &s;eparate the
righteous from the wicked as a &s;hepherd
divideth the &s;heep from the goats; and he &s;hall
<PB N="473" REF="484">
&s;et the righteous on his right hand, and the
wicked on his left! The$ &s;hall he &s;ay to them
on his right hand, Come, ye ble&s;&s;ed of my
Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you
from the foundation of the world. To them
on his left hand be &s;hall &s;ay, Depart from me,
ye cur&s;ed, into everla&s;ting fire, prepared for
the Devil and his angels; and the&s;e &s;hall go
into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, but the righteous
into life eternal</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Luke, xxi. 25. Daniel, vii. 9. Matth. xxv. 31.</NOTE>.&mdash;Whether every one
of the circum&s;tances here &s;et forth is to be
under&s;tood in a &s;trictly literal &s;en&s;e, or with
&s;ome mea&s;ure of my&s;tical and allegorical
interpretation, it is not ea&s;y to determine,
nor is it e&s;&s;ential for us to know. Regard
mu&s;t be had to the figurative &s;tyle fre|quently
employed by the &s;acred writers, of
which we find &s;o many examples in the
prophetical writings and the Book of Re|velations,
wherein tho&s;e &s;piritual divine
things which are above our conception,
are &s;et forth under &s;uch repre&s;entations of
&s;en&s;ible objects and appearances as are mo&s;t
<PB N="474" REF="485">
calculated to &s;trike and impre&s;s our minds.
The circum&s;tance, for in&s;tance, of books
being opened before the Judge, as contain|ing
a regi&s;ter of every man's actions, and
of the dead being judged from what had
been written in tho&s;e books, is plainly a
metaphorical allu&s;ion to what is practi&s;ed
among men; de&s;igned merely to convey
the &s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ion of God's &s;trict and
accurate ob&s;ervation of the minute&s;t par|ticulars
of men's behaviour on earth. It
is &s;ufficient for us to be &s;atisfied, that what|ever
tremendous grandeur may attend the
judgment of the la&s;t day, it will be con|ducted
in &s;uch a manner as &s;hall be per|fectly
&s;uitable to the perfections of the
Almighty.&mdash;Re&s;ting on &s;uch facts as are
plainly and explicitly revealed on this &s;ub|ject,
let us con&s;ider,</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, the Per&s;on who is to
act as Judge, even the eternal Son of God.
We mu&s;t all, &s;ays the text, <HI>appear before
the judgment-&s;eat of Chri&s;t.</HI> This is re|peated
in many pa&s;&s;ages of the New Te&s;|tament.
<PB N="475" REF="486">
The day of judgment is termed
<HI>the day of the Son of Man. The Father,</HI>
we are told, <HI>ju$geth no man, but hath com|mitted
all judgment to the Son</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">John, v. 22.</NOTE>.&mdash;This con|&s;titution
of Providence is, in many re|&s;pects,
wi&s;e, fit, and gracious. It was
highly proper that He who once, in the
cau&s;e of God and mankind, &s;tood as a
criminal before impious judges on earth,
&s;hould be thus &s;ignally vindicated and ho|noured,
by appearing in the illu&s;trious
character of the Judge of all the earth. It
was fit that the character of Judge and
Sovereign &s;hould be made known, as added
to the other characters he bore, of Prie&s;t
and Prophet, in order to give weight and
authority to all his precepts, from the
awful con&s;ideration that on our obedience
to him depends our everla&s;ting fate.&mdash;But
the mo&s;t &s;triking and important circum|&s;tance
in this appointment of Providence is,
the a&s;&s;urance which it affords us of the
perfect equity of this final judgment. For
<PB N="476" REF="487">
here we behold a Judge who is taken, as
we may &s;ay, from among our&s;elves. He
dwelt among&s;t us on earth, and did not
di&s;dain to call us brethren. He knows ex|perimentally
what human pa&s;&s;ions and hu|man
frailties are; and what the Apo&s;tle to
the Hebrews &s;ays of him as a Prie&s;t, may
be as fully applied to him as a Judge. <HI>We
have not a Judge who cannot be touched
with the feeling of our infirmities; but One
who was in all points tempted like as we are,
yet without &s;in.</HI> The infinite maje&s;ty of
the Supreme Being is an object at all times
overwhelming to the mind. In the &s;itua|tion
of a Judge particularly, it might fill
us with di&s;may. But in the per&s;on of our
ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer, that maje&s;ty is placed in
a milder light. The attribute of mercy
comes forward in &s;o con&s;picuous a manner,
as to allay the dread we would otherwi&s;e
entertain. To the ob&s;tinate and hardened
&s;inner, the judgment of our Saviour may
indeed ju&s;tly occa&s;ion terror. Well may
they be afraid of appearing before the judg|ment-&s;eat
of Chri&s;t, who have &s;corned and
<PB N="477" REF="488">
de&s;pi&s;ed him and his religion. But to the
pious and the humble, no con&s;ideration can
carry more comfort than that they are to
appear in judgment before him who &s;o
loved the human race as to die for them;
and from whom, therefore, may be ex|pected
every favourable allowance which
their ca&s;e will admit.&mdash;From the contem|plation
of the Judge, let us</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place, turn our thoughts
towards the per&s;ons who are to be judged.
The&s;e, we are again and again informed,
&s;hall be all mankind; both the quick and
the dead; tho&s;e who &s;hall then he found
upon the earth; and all the pa&s;t generations
who have fini&s;hed their cour&s;e, and been
long ago gathered unto their fathers. We
<HI>$$$mu&s;t all,</HI> &s;ays the text, <HI>appear before the
judgment-&s;eat of Chri&s;t.</HI>&mdash;No privilege &s;hall
exempt the great, no ob&s;curity &s;helter the
low from the judgment of God. All the
frivolous di&s;tinctions which fa&s;hion and
vanity had introduced among men, &s;hall at
that day be annihilated. No longer &s;hall
<PB N="478" REF="489">
we then appear under the per&s;onated cha|racters
of high and low, of rich and poor.&mdash;
Under the &s;imple character of men and
&s;ubjects of God, we &s;hall be brought forth
to be judged according to our works. In
the one great di&s;tinction of good and bad,
of righteous or wicked, all other di&s;tinctions
&s;hall then be eternally lo&s;t.&mdash;Let the fore|&s;ight
of this humble the pride of the o&s;ten|tatious
and the great. Thou who now car|rie&s;t
thy head &s;o high, &s;halt, upon the &s;ame
footing with thy lowe&s;t dependent, &s;tand
before the tribunal of the Almighty. Thou
who now oppre&s;&s;e&s;t thy weak brother with
impunity, &s;halt then tremble for thine own
&s;afety as much, perhaps more than he.
For <HI>there is no re&s;pect of per&s;ons with God.</HI>
&mdash;The la&s;t day is ju&s;tly &s;tyled the <HI>day of
the revelation of the &s;ecrets of all hearts.</HI>
Stripped of all di&s;gui&s;e, the character of
every man &s;hall be unveiled to public view.
Then &s;hall the fal&s;e friend be detected, the
concealed &s;landerer be expo&s;ed, the &s;ecret
adulterer, the treacherous enemy, the hypo|critical
pretender, be all brought to light&mdash;
<PB N="479" REF="490">
What a check &s;hould the thoughts of this di&s;|covery
give to the arts of di&s;&s;imulation and
fal&s;ehood? What avails it thee, O wi&s;e man of
the world! to pa&s;s for a &s;hort time with fair
colours before the eye of men, if by the
eye of God thou art already di&s;covered, and
&s;halt, at la&s;t, be di&s;covered to the view of
all mankind? If now thou art &s;o &s;olicitous
to conceal thy real character from the world,
and can&s;t not bear that the de&s;igns and
intrigues which have pa&s;&s;ed through thy
mind in the cour&s;e of but one day &s;hould
be all made known, do&s;t thou not tremble
at the thought of the whole machinations
of thy life being brought forth and pro|claimed
before a&s;&s;embled men and angels?
&mdash;At this great day too, when &s;ecret
vice is made known in order to be pu|ni&s;hed,
&s;ecret virtue &s;hall be di&s;clo&s;ed and
rewarded. The humble good man, who
pa&s;&s;ed unnoticed through the ob&s;curity of
private life; who&s;e days, if not marked by
any &s;plendid deeds, were ennobled by vir|tuous
actions, &s;hall then be &s;ingled out
from the crowd, and brought forward as
the friend of God and Heaven.&mdash;The an|gui&s;h
<PB N="480" REF="491">
of the wicked, upon the di&s;covery
and compari&s;on of the life of &s;uch a per&s;on
with their own, is thus beautifully de&s;cribed
by one of the Apocryphal writers; <HI>This
was he whom we had &s;ometimes in deri&s;ion,
and a proverb of reproach. We fools ac|counted
his life madne&s;s, and his end to be
without honour. Now he is numbered among
the children of God, and his lot is among the
&s;aints. But we wearied our&s;elves in the
way of de&s;truction. What hath pride pro|fited
us? Or what good hath riches with
our vaunting brought us? All tho&s;e things
are pa&s;&s;ed away like a &s;hadow, and as a po&s;t
that ha&s;ted by. But the righteous live for
evermore. Their reward al&s;o is with the
Lord; and the care of them with the Mo&s;t
High</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Wi&s;dom of Solomon, v. 3&ndash;15.</NOTE>.&mdash;From this view of the per&s;ons
who are to appear before the judgment-&s;eat
of Chri&s;t, let us</P>
<P>IN the third place, go on to the con|&s;ideration
of the things for which they are
to be judged. The&s;e, we are told in the
text, are all <HI>the things done in the body,
<PB N="481" REF="492">
whether they be good or bad.</HI> This is the
con&s;tant tenor of Scripture, that men are
to be judged <HI>according to their actions.</HI> It
is not &s;aid that men are to be finally judged
according to their principles or belief, but
<HI>according to their works.</HI> This does not
lead to any conclu&s;ion that principles or
belief are not e&s;&s;ential in forming a cha|racter.
Without good principles it cannot
be expected there can be any regular tenor
of good actions. But actions are the te&s;t
of principles. Whatever we may pretend
as to our belief, it is the &s;train of our
actions that mu&s;t &s;how whether our prin|ciples
have been good or bad; and &s;up|po&s;ing
them ever &s;o good, whether we
have allowed them to exert a proper in|fluence
on our conduct. The con&s;tant
doctrine of the Go&s;pel is, <HI>by their fruits ye
&s;hall know them. Not every one that &s;aith
unto me, Lord, Lord, but he that doeth the
will of my Father &s;hall enter into the king|dom
of heaven</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Matth. vii. 21.</NOTE>.&mdash;Of all the actions we
<PB N="482" REF="493">
have done, it is repre&s;ented that, in the day
of judgment &s;trict examination &s;hall be
taken. Not our public conduct only, and
what we reckon the momentous parts of
our life, but the indulgence of our private
plea&s;ures, the amu&s;ements of our &s;ecret
thoughts and idle hours, &s;hall be brought
into account. According to that emble|matical
repre&s;entation given in the Go&s;pel,
which I before mentioned as an expre&s;&s;ive
&s;igure, there is an invi&s;ible pen always
writing over our heads, and making
an exact regi&s;ter of all the tran&s;actions of
our life.&mdash;How careful and circum&s;pect
ought this to render us over every part of
our behaviour? If any of our actions were
of a tran&s;ient and fugitive nature; if they
were to die with us, and to be forgotten
as &s;oon as we are gone, there might be
&s;ome excu&s;e for a loo&s;e and incon&s;iderate
conduct. But we know the ca&s;e to be
widely different; and that what we are
doing now, we do for eternity. None of
our actions peri&s;h and are forgotten. They
will all accompany us to the tribunal of
<PB N="483" REF="494">
God. They will there te&s;tify, either for,
or again&s;t us; and however much we

<P>It will now be &s;aid, if &s;o &s;evere a &s;crutiny
mu&s;t be undergone for all we have done
and thought, who &s;hall be able to &s;tand
before God in judgment? How far from
innocence &s;hall the be&s;t of us be found at
that day?&mdash;The thought is undoubtedly
alarming. But let us not de&s;pond; we are
a&s;&s;ured, there <HI>is forgivene&s;s with God, that
he may be feared. He is not extreme to mark
iniquity; for he knows our frame and re|members
we are du&s;t.</HI> Powerful is the atone|ment
of our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer to procure
pardon for the greate&s;t &s;inner who has been
penitent. We have all rea&s;on to believe,
that amid&s;t numberle&s;s in$irmities which
attend humanity, what the great Judge will
chiefly regard, is the habitual pre$ailing
turn of our heart and life; how far we
<PB N="484" REF="495">
have been actuated by a &s;incere de&s;ire to
do our duty. This we know for certain,
that all the mea&s;ures of this judgment &s;hall
be conducted with mo&s;t perfect equity.
God will not exact from any man what he
had never given him. He will judge him
according to the degree of light that was
afforded him, according to the means of
knowledge and improvement that were
put into his hands. $ence, many a vir|tuous
heathen &s;hall be preferred before
many mere profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tian faith.
<HI>They &s;hall come from the ca&s;t and the we&s;t,
the north and the &s;outh, and &s;it down in
the kingdom of God; when the children of
the kingdom are ca&s;t out</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Luke, xiii. 29. Matth. viii. 11.</NOTE>. For, as the
Apo&s;tle to the Romans hath taught us,

In the account given by our Lord of the
procedure of the la&s;t judgment, in the 25th
chapter of the Go&s;pel of Matthew, parti|cular
&s;tre&s;s is laid upon works of benefi|cence
and mercy; on the hungry being fed,
the naked being cloathed, and the &s;ick
being vi&s;ited by the righteous. But though,
in that parable, no virtues of any other
kind are particularized, we are certainly
not to infer any exclu&s;ion of other parts
of duty; of piety, ju&s;tice, temperance, and
purity; as requi&s;ite to the character of the
man, who, at the la&s;t day will be accepted
by God. The &s;cope of the parable was to
impre&s;s that covetous and &s;elfi&s;h nation of
the Jews, to whom the parable was ad|dre&s;&s;ed,
with a deep &s;en&s;e of the import|ance
of tho&s;e virtues in which they were
remarkably de&s;icient, and which are, in
them&s;elves &s;o e&s;&s;ential, compa&s;&s;ion and hu|manity

that final definitive &s;entence which is to

are by the Great Judge called to eternal
life and happine&s;s; and the wicked ap|pointed
to go into everl&s;ting puni&s;hment.
&mdash;Into tho&s;e future habitations of the good

<HEAD>A
SHORT ACCOUNT
OF THE
LIFE and CHARACTER
OF
DR. HUGH BLAIR.</HEAD>
<P>DR. HUGH BLAIR was born in Edin|burgh,
on the 7th day of April, 1718.
His father, John Blair, a re&s;pectable merchant
in that city, was a de&s;cendant of the ancient
family of Blair, in Ayr&s;hire, and grand&s;on of
the famous Mr. Robert Blair, Mini&s;ter of St.
Andrew's, Chaplain to Charles I and one
of the mo&s;t zealous and di&s;tingui&s;hed clergy|men
of the period in which he lived. This
worthy man, though firmly attached to the
cau&s;e of freedom, and to the Pre&s;byterian form
of church government, and though actively en|gaged
<PB N="492" REF="502">
in all the mea&s;ures adopted for their &s;up|port;
yet, by his &s;teady, t$mperate conduct,
commanded the re&s;pect even of his opponents.
In preference to all the other eccle&s;ia&s;tical
leaders of the cov$nanting party, he was &s;elected
by the King him&s;elf to $ill an office which, from
the circum&s;tances of the time, gave frequent
acce&s;s to the Royal Per&s;on; &startq;becau&s;e,&endq; &s;aid
his Maje&s;ty, &startq;that man is pious, prudent,
learned, and of a meek and moderate calm
temper.&endq;&mdash;His talents &s;eem to have de&s;cended
as an inheritance to his po&s;terity. For, of the
two &s;ons who &s;urvived him, David, the elde&s;t,
was a clergyman of eminence in Edinburgh,
father to Mr. Robert Blair, Mini&s;ter of Athel|&s;tonford,
the celebrated author of the poem
intitled <HI>The Grave;</HI> and grandfather to his
Maje&s;ty's Solicitor General for Scotland, who&s;e
ma&s;culine eloquence and profound knowledge
of law have, in the public e&s;timation, placed
him indi&s;putably at the head of the Scotti&s;h bar.
From his younge&s;t &s;on $ugh, who engaged in
bu&s;ine&s;s as a merchant, and had the honour to
fill a high &s;tation in the magi&s;tracy of Edinburgh,
&s;prung the learned clergyman, who is the &s;ub|ject
of this narrative.</P>
<P><PB N="493" REF="503">
THE views of Dr. Blair, from his earlie&s;t
youth, were turned towards the Church, and
his education received a &s;uitable direction.
After the u&s;ual grammatical cour&s;e at &s;chool,
he entered the Humanity Cla&s;s in the Univer&s;ity
of Edinburgh, in October 1730, and &s;pent
eleven years at that celebrated &s;eminary, a&s;&s;idu|ou&s;ly
employed in the literary and &s;cientific
&s;tudies pre&s;cribed by the Church of Scotland to
all who are to become candidates for her licence
to preach the Go&s;pel. During this important
period, he was di&s;tingui&s;hed among his com|panions
both for diligence and pro$iciency; and
obtained from the Profe&s;&s;ors under whom he
&s;tudied, repeated te&s;timonies of approbation.
One of them de&s;erves to be mentioned particu|larly,
becau&s;e in his own opinion, it determined
the bent of his genius towards polite literature.
An e&s;&s;ay, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> or, <HI>On the Beautiful,</HI>
written by him when a &s;tudent of logic in the
u&s;ual cour&s;e of academical exerci&s;es, had the
good fortune to attract the notice of Profe&s;&s;or
Steven&s;on, and, with circum&s;tances honourable
to the author, was appointed to be read in public
at the conclu&s;ion of the Se&s;&s;ion. This mark
<PB N="494" REF="504">
of di&s;tinction made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on his
mind; and the e&s;&s;ay which merited it, he ever
after recollected with partial affection, and pre|&s;erved
to the day of his death as the fir&s;t earne&s;t
of his fame.</P>
<P>AT this time Dr. Blair commenced a method
of &s;tudy which contributed much to the ac|curacy
and extent of his knowledge, and which
he continued to practi&s;e occa&s;ionally even after
his reputation was fully e&s;tabli&s;hed. It con&s;i&s;ted
in making ab&s;tracts of the mo&s;t important works
which he read, and in dige&s;ting them according
to the train of his own thoughts. Hi&s;tory, in
particular, he re&s;olved to &s;tudy in this manner;
and, in concert with &s;ome of his youthful a&s;&s;o|ciates,
he con&s;tructed a very comprehen&s;ive
&s;cheme of chronological tables, for receiving into
its proper place every important fact that &s;hould
occur. The &s;cheme devi&s;ed by this young
&s;tudent for his own private u&s;e was afterwards
improved, filled up, and given to the Public by
his learned friend Dr. John Blair, Prebendary of
We&s;tmin&s;ter, in his valuable work, &startq;The
Chronology and Hi&s;tory of the World.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="495" REF="505">
IN the year 1739, Dr. Blair took his degree
of A. M. On that occa&s;ion he printed and de|fended
a the&s;is <HI>De Fundamentis et Obligatione
Legis Naturae,</HI> which contains a &s;hort, but ma&s;|terly
di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this important &s;ubject, and
exhibits in elegant Latin an outline of the moral
principles, which have been &s;ince more fully
unfolded and illu&s;trated in his Sermons.</P>
<P>THE Univer&s;ity of Edinburgh, about this
period, numbered among her pupils many young
men who were &s;oon to make a di&s;tingui&s;hed
figure in the civil, the eccle&s;ia&s;tical, and the
literary hi&s;tory of their country. With mo&s;t
of them Dr. Blair entered into habits of intimate
connection, which no future competition or jea|lou&s;y
occurred to interrupt, which held them
united through life in their views of public good,
and which had the mo&s;t beneficial influence on
their own improvement, on the progre&s;s of ele|gance
and ta&s;te among their cotemporaries, and
on the general intere&s;ts of the community to
which they belonged.</P>
<P>ON the completion of his academical cour&s;e,
he underwent the cu&s;tomary trials before the
<PB N="496" REF="506">
Pre&s;bytery of Edinburgh, and received from that
venerable body a licence to preach the Go&s;pel, on
the 21&s;t of October 1741. His public life now
commenced with very favourable pro&s;pects.
The reputation which he brought from the
Univer&s;ity was folly ju&s;tified by his fir&s;t appear|ances
in the pulpit; and, in a few months, the
fame of his eloquence procured for him a pre|&s;entation
to the pari&s;h of Cole&s;&s;ie in Fi$e, where
he was ordained to the office of the holy mini&s;|try,
on the 23d of September 1742. But he
was not permitted to remain long in this rural
retreat. A vacancy in the &s;econd charge of the
Canongate of Edinburgh furni&s;hed to his friends
an opportunity of recalling him to a &s;tation
more &s;uited to his talents. And, though one
of the mo&s;t popular and eloquent clergymen in
the Church was placed in competition with him,
a great majority of the electors decided in favour
of this young orator, and re&s;tored him in July
1743 to the bounds of his native city.</P>
<P>IN this &s;tation Dr. Blair continued eleven
year, di&s;charging with great $id$lity and &s;uc|ce&s;s
the various duties of the pa&s;toral office.
<PB N="497" REF="507">
His di&s;cour&s;es from the pulpit in particular at|tracted
univer&s;al admiration. They were com|po&s;ed
with uncommon care; and, occupying a
middle place between the dry metaphy&s;ical di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion
of one cla&s;s of preachers, and the loo&s;e
incoherent declamation of another, they blended
together, in the happie&s;t manner, the light of
argument with the warmth of exhortation, and
exhibited captivating &s;pecimens of what had
hitherto been rarely heard in Scotland, the po|li&s;hed,
well-compacted, and regular didactic
oration.</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of a call from the Town-Council
and General-Se&s;&s;ion of Edinburgh, he
was tran&s;lated from the Canongate to Lady
Ye&s;ter's, one of the city churches, on the 11th
of October 1754: and on the 15th day of June
1758, he was promoted to the High Church of
Edinburgh, the mo&s;t important eccle&s;ia&s;tical
charge in the kingdom. To this charge he was
rai&s;ed at the reque&s;t of the Lords of Council and
Se&s;&s;ion, and of the other di&s;tingui&s;hed official
characters who have their &s;eats in that church.
And the uniform prudence, ability and &s;ucce&s;s
<PB N="498" REF="508">
which, for a period of more than forty years,
accompanied all his mini&s;terial labours in that
con&s;picuous and difficult &s;tation, &s;ufficiently
evince the wi&s;dom of their choice.</P>
<P>HITHERTO his attention &s;eems to have been
devoted almo&s;t exclu&s;ively to the attainment
of profe&s;&s;ional excellence; and to the regular
di&s;charge of his parochial duties. No production
of his pen had yet been given to the world by him|&s;elf,
except two &s;ermons preached on particular
occa&s;ions, &s;ome tran&s;lations, in ver&s;e, of pa&s;&s;ages
of Scripture for the P&s;almody of the Church, and
a few articles in the Edinburgh Review; a pub|lication
begun in 1755, and conducted for a
&s;hort time by &s;ome of the able&s;t men in the
kingdom. But &s;tanding as he now did at the
head of his profe&s;&s;ion, and relea&s;ed by the labour
of former years from the drudgery of weekly
preparation for the pulpit, he began to think
&s;eriou&s;ly on a plan for teaching to others that
art which had contributed &s;o much to the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment
of his own fame. With this view, he
communicated to his friends a &s;cheme of Lec|tures
on Compo&s;ition; and, having obtained the
<PB N="499" REF="509">
approbation of the Univer&s;ity, he began to
read them in the College on the 11th of De|cember
1759. To this undertaking he brought
all the qualifications requi&s;ite for executing it
well; and along with them a weight of repu|tation,
which could not fail to give effect to the
le&s;&s;ons he &s;hould deliver. For, be&s;ides the te&s;|timony
given to his talents by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ive pro|motions
in the Church, the Univer&s;ity of St.
Andrew's, moved chiefly by the merit of his
eloquence, had in June 1757 conferred on him
the degree of D. D. a literary honour which, at
that time, was very rare in Scotland. Accord|ingly
his fir&s;t Cour&s;e of Lectures was well at|tended,
and received with great applau&s;e. The
patrons of the Univer&s;ity, convinced that they
would form a valuable addition to the &s;y&s;tem of
education, agreed in the following &s;ummer to
in&s;titute a rhetorical cla&s;s, under his direction, as
a permanent part of their academical e&s;tabli&s;h|ment:
and, on the 7th of April 1762, his Ma|je&s;ty
was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed &startq;To erect and en|dow
a Profe&s;&s;or&s;hip of Rhetoric and Belles
Lettres in the Univer&s;ity of Edinburgh, and
to appoint Dr. Blair, in con&s;ideration of his
<PB N="500" REF="510">
approved qualifications, Regius Profe&s;&s;or there|of,
with a &s;alary of &pound;. 70.&endq; The&s;e Lectures
he publi&s;hed in 1783, when he retired from the
labours of the office; and the general voice of
the Public has pronounced them to be a mo&s;t
judicious, elegant, and comprehen&s;ive &s;y&s;tem of
rules for forming the &s;tyle and cultivating the
ta&s;te of youth.</P>
<P>ABOUT the time in which he was occupied
in laying the foundations of this u&s;eful in&s;titution,
he had an opportunity of conferring another im|portant
obligation on the literary world, by the
part which he acted in re&s;cuing from oblivion
the poems of C&s;&s;ian. It was by the &s;olicitation
of Dr. Blair and Mr. John Home that Mr. Mac|pher&s;on
was induced to publi&s;h his <HI>Fragments
of Ancient Poetry;</HI> and their patronage was of
e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice in procuring the &s;ub&s;cription
which enabled him to undertake his tour through
the Highlands for collecting the materials of
Fingal, and of tho&s;e other delightful produc|tions
which bear the name of O&s;&s;ian. To the&s;e
productions Dr. Blair applied the te&s;t of genuine
critici&s;m, and &s;oon after their publication gave
<PB N="501" REF="511">
an e&s;timate of their merits in <HI>a Di&s;&s;ertation,</HI>
which, for beauty of language, delicacy of ta&s;te,
and acutene&s;s of critical inve&s;tigation, has few
parallels. It was printed in 1763, and &s;pread
the reputation of its author throughout Europe.</P>
<P>THE great objects of his literary ambition
being now attained, his talents were for many
years con&s;ecrated &s;olely to the important and
peculiar employments of his &s;tation. It was not
till the year 1777 that he could be induced to
favour the world with a volume of the Sermons
which had &s;o long furni&s;hed in&s;truction and de|light
to his own congregation. But this volume
being well received, the public approbation en|couraged
him to proceed: three other volumes
followed at different intervals; and all of them
experienced a degree of &s;ucce&s;s of which few
publications can boa&s;t. They circulated rapidly
and widely wherever the Engli&s;h tongue ex|tends;
they were &s;oon tran&s;lated into almo&s;t all
the languages of Europe; and his pre&s;ent Ma|je&s;ty,
with that wi&s;e attention to the intere&s;ts of
religion and literature which di&s;tingui&s;hes his
reign, was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to judge them
<PB N="502" REF="512">
worthy of a public reward. By a royal mandate
to the Exchequer in Scotland, dated July 25th,
1780, a pen&s;ion of <HI>L.</HI> 200 a-year was conferred
on their author, which continued unaltered till
his death.</P>
<P>THE motives which gave ri&s;e to the pre&s;ent
volume are &s;ufficiently explained by him&s;elf in
his Addre&s;s to the Reader. The Sermons which
it contains were compo&s;ed at very different periods
of his life; but they were all written out anew in
his own hand, and in many parts re-compo&s;ed,
during the cour&s;e of la&s;t &s;ummer, after he had
completed his eighty-&s;econd year. They were
delivered to the publi&s;hers about &s;ix weeks before
his death, in the form and order in which they
now appear. And it may grati$y his readers to
know, that the la&s;t of them which he compo&s;ed,
though not the la&s;t in the order adopted for pub|lication,
was the Sermon on <HI>a Life of Di&s;&s;ipation
and Plea&s;ure</HI>&mdash;a &s;ermon written with great dignity
and eloquence, and which &s;hould be regarded as
his &s;olemn parting admonition to a cla&s;s of
men, who&s;e conduct is highly important to
the community, and who&s;e reformation and
<PB N="503" REF="513">
virtue he had long laboured mo&s;t zealou&s;ly to
promote.</P>
<P>THE Sermons which he has given to the
world are univer&s;ally admitted to be models in
their kind; and they will long remain durable
monuments of the piety, the genius, and &s;ound
judgment of their author. But they formed
only a &s;mall part of the Di&s;cour&s;es he prepared
for the pulpit. The remainder, mode&s;ty led him
to think unfit for the pre&s;s; and, influenced by
an excu&s;able &s;olicitude for his reputation, he left
behind him an explicit injunction that his nu|merous
manu&s;cripts &s;hould be de&s;troyed. The
greatne&s;s of their number was creditable to his
profe&s;&s;ional character, and exhibited a convincing
proof that his fame as a public teacher had been
honourably purcha&s;ed, by the mo&s;t unwearied
application to the private and un&s;een labours of
his office. It re&s;ted on the uniform intrin&s;ic
excellence of his Di&s;cour&s;es, in point of matter
and compo&s;ition, rather than on foreign attrac|tions;
for his delivery, though di&s;tinct, &s;erious,
and impre&s;&s;ive, was not remarkably di&s;tingui&s;hed
by that magic charm of voice and action which
<PB N="504" REF="514">
captivates the &s;en&s;es and imagination, and which,
in the e&s;timation of &s;uperficial hearers, con&s;titutes
the chief merit of a preacher.</P>
<P>IN that department of his profe&s;&s;ional duty
which regarded the government of the church,
Dr. Blair was &s;teadily attached to the cau&s;e of
moderation. From diffidence, and perhaps from
a certain degree of inaptitude for extemporary
&s;peaking, he took a le&s;s public part in the con|te&s;ts
of eccle&s;ia&s;tical politics than &s;ome of his
cotemporaries; and, from the &s;ame cau&s;es, he
never would con&s;ent to become Moderator of the
General A&s;&s;embly of the Church of Scotland.
But his influence among his brethren was ex|ten&s;ive:
his opinion, guided by that &s;ound up|rightne&s;s
of judgment, which formed the pre|dominant
feature of his intellectual character,
had been always held in high re&s;pect by the
friends with whom he acted; and, for many of
the la&s;t years of his life, it was received by them
almo&s;t as a law. The great leading principle
in which they cordially concurred with him, and
which directed all their mea&s;ures, was to pre|&s;erve
<PB N="505" REF="515">
the church, on the one &s;ide, from a &s;lavi&s;h,
corrupting dependance on the civil power; and,
on the other, from a greater infu&s;ion of demo|cratical
influence than is compatible with good
order, and the e&s;tabli&s;hed con&s;titution of the
country.</P>
<P>THE reputation which he acquired in the
di&s;charge of his public duties, was well &s;u&s;tained
by the great re&s;pectability of his private character.
Deriving from family a&s;&s;ociations a &s;trong &s;en&s;e
of clerical decorum, feeling on his heart deep
impre&s;&s;ions of religious and moral obligation, and
guided in his intercour&s;e with the world by the
&s;ame correct and delicate ta&s;te which appeared
in his writings, he was eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed
through life by the prudence, purity, and dig|nified
propriety of his conduct. His mind, by
con&s;titution and culture, was admirably formed
for enjoying happine&s;s. Well-balanced in it&s;elf
by the nice proportion and adju&s;tment of its
faculties, it did not incline him to any of tho&s;e ex|centricities,
either of opinion or of action, which
are too often the lot of genius:&mdash;free from all
<PB N="506" REF="516">
$incture of envy, it delighted cordially in the
pro&s;perity and fame of his companions: &s;en&s;ible
to the e&s;timation in which he him&s;elf was held,
it di&s;po&s;ed him to dwell at times on the thought
of his &s;ucce&s;s with a &s;atisfaction which he did
not affect to conceal: inacce&s;&s;ible alike to gloomy
and to peevi&s;h impre&s;&s;ions, it was always ma&s;ter
of its own movements, and ready, in an uncom|mon
degree, to take an active and plea&s;ing in|tere&s;t
in every thing, whether important or trifling,
that happened to become for the moment the
object of his attention. This habit of mind,
tempered with the mo&s;t un&s;u&s;pecting &s;implicity,
and united to eminent talents and inflexible in|tegrity,
while it &s;ecured to the la&s;t his own reli&s;h
of life, was wonderfully calculated to endear
him to his friends, and to render him an invalu|able
member of any &s;ociety to which he be|longed.
Accordingly there have been few men
more univer&s;ally re&s;pected by tho&s;e who knew
him, more &s;incerely e&s;teemed in the circle of his
acquaintance, or more tenderly beloved by tho&s;e
who enjoyed the ble&s;&s;ing of his private and do|me&s;tic
connection.</P>
<P><PB N="507" REF="517">
IN April 1748, he married his cou&s;in Katharine
Bannatine, daughter of the Rev. James Banna|tine,
one of the Mini&s;ters of Edinburgh. By
her he had a &s;on who died in infancy, and a
daughter, who lived to her twenty-fir&s;t year,
the pride of her parents, and adorned with all
the accompli&s;hments that became her age and
&s;ex. Mrs. Blair her&s;elf, a woman of great good
&s;en&s;e and &s;pirit, was al&s;o taken from him a few
years before his death, after &s;he had &s;hared with
the tendere&s;t affection in all his fortunes, and
contributed near half a century to his happine&s;s
and comfort.</P>
<P>DR. BLAIR had been naturally of a feeble
con&s;titution of body; but as he grew up his
con&s;titution acquired greater firmne&s;s and vigour.
Though liable to occa&s;ional attacks from &s;ome
of the &s;harp$$t and mo&s;t painful di&s;ea&s;es that
afflict the human frame, he enjoyed a general
&s;tate of good health; and, through habitual
cheerfulne&s;s, temperance, and care, &s;urvived the
u&s;ual term of human life.&mdash;For &s;ome years he
had felt him&s;elf unequal to the fatigue of in&s;truct|ing
his very large congregation from the pulpit;
<PB N="508" REF="518">
and, under the impre&s;&s;ion which this feeling
produced, he has been heard at times to &s;ay
with a &s;igh, &startq;that he was left almo&s;t the la&s;t
&startq;of his cotemporaries.&endq; Yet he continued to
the end in the regular di&s;charge of all his other
official duties, and particularly in giving advice
to the afflicted, who, from different quarters of
the kingdom, &s;olicited his corre&s;pondence. His
la&s;t &s;ummer was devoted to the preparation of
this volume of Sermons; and, in the cour&s;e of
it, he exhibited a vigour of under&s;tanding and
capacity of exertion equal to that of his be&s;t days.
He began the winter plea&s;ed with him&s;elf on
account of the completion of this work; and his
friends were flattered with the hope that he
might live to enjoy the acce&s;&s;ion of emolument
and fame which he expected it would bring.
But the $eeds of a mortal di&s;ea&s;e were lurking
unperceived within him. On the 24th of De|cember
1800, he complained of a pain in his
bowels, which, during that and the following day,
gave him but little unea&s;ine&s;s; and he received
as u&s;ual the vi&s;its of his friends. On the after|noon
of the 26th, the &s;ymptoms became violent
and alarming:&mdash;he felt that he was approaching
<PB N="509" REF="519">
the end of his appointed cour&s;e: and retaining
to the la&s;t moment the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his
mental faculties, he expired on the morning of
the 27th, with the compo&s;ure and hope which
become a Chri&s;tian pa&s;tor.</P>
<P>THE lamentation for his death was uni|ver&s;al
and deep through the city which he
had &s;o long in&s;tructed and adorned. Its Magi&s;|trates,
participating in the general grief, ap|pointed
his church to be put in mou$ning; and
his colleague in it, the writer of this Narrative,
who had often experienced the ine&s;timable value
of his coun&s;el and friend&s;hip, delivered on the
Sabbath after his funeral a di&s;cour&s;e to his con|gregation,
with an extract from which this ac|count
&s;hall be clo&s;ed. It is in&s;erted here at the
particular reque&s;t of that very re&s;pectable body
of men who compo&s;ed his Kirk Se&s;&s;ion, and who,
by their public approbation of this tribute to his
memory, are de&s;irous of tran&s;mitting, with his
Sermons, to po&s;terity a memorial of the vene|ration
and e&s;teem with which his conduct had
in&s;pired them.&mdash;After exhorting to contemplate
and follow the patriarchs and faints of former
<PB N="510" REF="520">
ages, <HI>who, through faith and patience, inherit the
promi&s;es,</HI> the Preacher thus proceeded:</P>
<P>&startq;IN this competition for virtuous attainment
it may be often u&s;eful to bring down your
eye, from contemplating the departed worthies
of di&s;tant times and countries, towards pat|terns
of imitation that are endeared to you by
more tender ties. If, in the relations of life,
you have had a connection,&mdash;if, in the circle
of your own family, you have had a father,
a hu&s;band, or a brother, who di&s;charged with
exemplary $idelity the duties of his &s;tation,
whom every tongue ble&s;&s;ed as the friend of
God and man, and who died as he lived, full
of faith and hope, place him before you as
the model of your conduct,&mdash;conceive him
bending from his &s;eat in the &s;kies, plea&s;ed with
your attachment, deeply intere&s;ted in your
&s;ucce&s;s, and cheering you in your labours of
love. His image will be as a guardian angel,
to admoni&s;h you when dangers approach, to
rou&s;e within you every principle of virtuous
exertion, and to in&s;pire you with &s;trength to
overcome.</P>
<P><PB N="511" REF="521">
OUR hearts, Chri&s;tians, have been deeply
pierced with the lo&s;s of a mo&s;t valuable con|nection,
of a venerable pa&s;tor, who watched
long for our &s;ouls, and, with the mo&s;t un|wearied
fidelity, pointed out to us the path
of happine&s;s. To you, and to the general
intere&s;ts of pure religion, he was attached by
many powerful obligations. A native of this
city, and de&s;cended from a family which, in
former times, had given &s;everal bright orna|ments
to the Church of Scotland, he felt the
warme&s;t tendencies of nature co-operating
with the principles of duty, to call forth all
his powers in the &s;acred &s;ervice to which he
was devoted. And, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God
on his indu&s;try, he ro&s;e to an eminence in
profe&s;&s;ional merit, which has reflected di&s;|tingui&s;hed
honour on the city, on the church,
and on the country which produced him.</P>
<P>IT was the fortune of Dr. Blair to appear
at a period when the literature of his country
was ju&s;t beginning to receive poli&s;h and an
u&s;eful direction; and when it was emulou&s;ly
cultivated by a bright con&s;tellation of young
<PB N="512" REF="522">
men who were de&s;tined to carry it to high
perfection. In concert with them he applied
him&s;elf with diligence and a&s;&s;iduity to all
tho&s;e branches of &s;tudy which could con|tribute
to form him for the eloquence of the
pulpit. This was the department in which he
cho&s;e to excel; to which all the force of his
genius was directed; and in which he &s;oon
felt that his efforts were to be &s;ucce&s;sful. For
from the very commencement of his theolo|gical
&s;tudies, he gave pre&s;ages of his future
attainments; and, in the &s;ocieties of his
youthful companions, laid the foundations of
that &s;plendid reputation which, through a long
life of meritorious &s;ervice, continued to in|crea&s;e;
and which has procured for him as a
religious in&s;tructor, acce&s;s to the under&s;tand|ings
and the hearts of all the mo&s;t cultivated
inhabitants of the Chri&s;tian world.</P>
<P>To you, my brethren, who have long en|joyed
the ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing of his immediate
in&s;truction, it will not be nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;cribe
the qualities of that luminous, fa&s;cinating elo|quence,
with which he was accu&s;tomed to
<PB N="513" REF="523">
warm, and ravi&s;h, and amend your hearts.
You may have heard others who equal|led,
or even excelled him in &s;ome of the
requi&s;ites of pulpit oratory, in occa&s;ional pro|foundne&s;s
of thought, in vivid fla&s;hes of ima|gination,
or in pathetic addre&s;&s;es to the heart.
But there never was a public teacher in
whom all the&s;e requi&s;ites were combined
in ju&s;ter proportions, placed under the di|rection
of a more exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;e of propriety,
and employed with more uniform &s;ucce&s;s to
convey u&s;eful and practical in&s;truction. Stand|ing
on the foundation of the Apo&s;tles and
Prophets, he exhibited the doctrines of Chri&s;t
in their genuine purity, &s;eparated from the
dro&s;s of &s;uper&s;tition, and traced with inimi$$$$$
elegance, through all their beneficial influence
on the con&s;olation, on the order, and on the
virtue both of public and private life. Hence
his di&s;cour&s;es, uniting in the mo&s;t perfect form
the attractions of utility and beauty, gave a
new and better tone to the &s;tyle of in&s;truction
from the pulpit; and contributed in a remark|able
degree to correct and refine the religious,
the moral, and the literary ta&s;te of the times
in which he lived.</P>
<P><PB N="514" REF="524">
THE univer&s;al admiration which attended
his mini&s;terial labours, was &s;ome recompence
to him for the exertions they had co&s;t. But
his chief recompence aro&s;e from the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of having contributed &s;o eminently
to edi&s;y the Church of Chri&s;t, and from the
improving influence which his labours had &s;hed
on his own heart. For he was at home and
in him&s;elf the perfect image of that meekne&s;s,
&s;implicity, gentlene&s;s, and contentment, which
his writings recommend. He was long happy
in his dome&s;tic relations; and, though doomed
at la&s;t to feel, through their lo&s;s in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,
the heavie&s;t &s;trokes of affliction; yet his mind,
forti&s;ied by religious habits, and buoyed up
by his native tendency to contentment, &s;u&s;|tained
it&s;elf on God, and enabled him to per|&s;evere
to the end in the active and cheer|ful
di&s;charge of the duties of his &s;tation; pre|paring
for the world the ble&s;&s;ings of elegant
in&s;truction; tendering to the mourner the
le&s;&s;ons of divine con&s;olation; guiding the
young by his coun&s;els; aiding the meritorious
with his influence; and &s;upporting, by his
voice and by his conduct, the civil and eccle|&s;ia&s;tical
in&s;titutions of his Country.</P>
<P><PB N="515" REF="525">
WITH &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions and habits it was
natural that he &s;hould enjoy a di&s;tingui&s;hed
portion of felicity. And perhaps there never
was a man who experienced more completely
that <HI>the ways of wi&s;dom are ways of plea&s;antne&s;s,
and that all her paths are peace.</HI> His Country
was proud of his merits, and at different times
conferred on him, through the hands of the
Sovereign, the mo&s;t honourable and &s;ub&s;tan|tial
proofs of her approbation: foreign lands
learned from him the way of &s;alvation: he
&s;aw marks of deference and re&s;pect wherever
he appeared: and he felt within him&s;elf the
gratulations of a good con&s;cience, and the
hope of immortality. It was peculiarly de|lightful
to &s;ee him in the late&s;t period of his
life, at the venerable age of eighty-two, look|ing
back on almo&s;t three&s;core years &s;pent in
the public &s;ervice of his God, plea&s;ed with the
recollections which it gave, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a mind
&s;till vigorous and clear, the delight of his
friends, &s;en&s;ible to the attentions which they
paid to him, burning with zeal for the good of
the Church, and, with all the ardour of youth|ful
ambition, preparing the materials of a new
claim to the gratitude and admiration of po&s;te|rity.
<PB N="516" REF="526">
In this active &s;late of preparation, with
the lamp of life &s;till clear and bright, he was
found by the Great Lord of all when he came
to &s;ay It is enough;r' and, after a &s;ingle
night of pain, to call him gently to his re&s;t.</P>
<P>&startq;HE has gone to give an account of his
&s;teward&s;hip.&mdash;The Church mourns in him the
lo&s;s of her brighte&s;t ornament.&mdash;Let us &s;ub|mit
to the &s;troke with re&s;ignation and rever|ence;
and, as the mo&s;t acceptable proof of
re&s;pect to his memory, let us learn to practi&s;e
the le&s;&s;ons which he taught.&endq;</P>
