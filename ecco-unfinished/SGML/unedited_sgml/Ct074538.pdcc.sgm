<P>WERE I to addre&s;s you in the accu&s;tomed declamatory &s;train which has long been adopted as the <HI>univer&s;al lan|guage</HI> of dedications, viz.

<P>Permit me to indulge the plea&s;ing hope, that when I a&s;&s;ert my mind is deeply im|pre&s;&s;ed with the mo&s;t grateful &s;en&s;e of the obligation, I &s;hall be honoured with credit. If this opinion be well founded, to enlarge on the &s;ubject were &s;uperfluous&mdash;if other|wi&s;e, the &s;tronge&s;t arguments, the mo&s;t &s;plendid and forcible language could convey, would not en&s;ure conviction; I therefore de&s;i&s;t, fully per&s;uaded that the mo&s;t &s;atisfac|tory demon&s;tration I can po&s;&s;ibly exhibit of the &s;incerity of this declaration, will be, an inviolable adherence to that uniform line of

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>CUSTOM, it has been repeatedly ob&s;erved by many of my worthy (and &s;ome per|haps <HI>unworthy</HI>) predece&s;&s;ors in author&s;hip, has rendered a preface almo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary; while others again have as fre|quently remarked, that "<HI>cu&s;tom is the law of fools</HI>." The&s;e con&s;iderations induced me to he&s;itate whether I &s;hould u&s;her my perform|ance into the world with a preface, and thus hazard being cla&s;&s;ed with the adherents to that law, or by omitting it, e&s;cape the op|probrium, for "<HI>who &s;hall decide when doctors di&s;agree?</HI>" Now though I would not take upon me to decide in every point in which doctors di&s;agree, yet after giving the pre&s;ent &s;ubject that mature con&s;ideration which &s;o important a concern required, I thought my|&s;elf fully competent to decide, if not to general &s;atisfaction, at lea&s;t &s;o as fully to &s;a|tisfy
<PB N="x" REF="9">
one particular per&s;on, for whom I pro|fe&s;s to have a very great regard, though per|haps few are to be found who would be equally conde&s;cending to him, who that per|&s;on is I do not wi&s;h publicly to declare, as (being a very mode&s;t man) it might offend him, I &s;hall only &s;ay, the more you read the memoirs contained in the following pages, the better you will become acquainted with him; I grounded my deci&s;ion on the&s;e argu|ments; I concluded as mo&s;t of my brethren of the quill do of their labours, that my performance po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;o much intrin&s;ic me|rit, as would occa&s;ion it to be univer&s;ally admired by all good judges, as a prodigious effort of human genius, and that this ap|probation mu&s;t naturally excite the envy of &s;ome authors, who had not met with that high applau&s;e <HI>they</HI> deemed them&s;elves entitled to, and incline them to &s;earch for imperfections in my work, and though I was per&s;uaded of the impo&s;&s;ibility of their finding
<PB N="xi" REF="10">
any, yet being thus foiled, they might catch at the want of a preface, and con&s;true <HI>that</HI> into an omi&s;&s;ion, &s;o that in order to di&s;arm them, I re&s;olved to have one, e&s;pe|cially as tho&s;e who deem prefaces unnece&s;&s;ary, may, if they choo&s;e, decline reading it, whil&s;t tho&s;e on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion, if there was none, might be di&s;appointed, and have cau&s;e for complaint; but to be &s;erious (if I can.)</P>
<P>Almo&s;t every author on producing the effu&s;ions of his pen (and his brain if he has any) thinks it prudent to introduce him&s;elf by a kind of <HI>Prologue</HI>, as it may be called, &s;tating his rea&s;ons with due preci&s;ion for intruding him&s;elf on his readers (whether true or otherwi&s;e, is not always material to enquire) be&s;peaking their candour towards his weakne&s;&s;es and imperfections (which by the bye, few authors are &s;o &s;en&s;ible of as their readers) and not unfrequently endeavouring to &s;oothe tho&s;e GOLIAHS
<PB N="xii" REF="11">
in literature ycleped <HI>critics</HI> (with whom not many little Davids are found hardy enough to contend) believing thus to coax them into good humour, or perhaps if his vanity preponderates, he throws the gaunlet of defiance, with a view of terrifying them either to hold their peace, or do ju&s;tice to tho&s;e mighty abilities <HI>he</HI> is confident he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, in a degree eminently &s;uperior to mo&s;t of his brethren.</P>
<P>For my own part, I di&s;claim adopting either of the&s;e modes, convinced, that in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, every reader, whatever the author may plead, will (and indeed ought) to judge for him&s;elf, and with regard to profe&s;&s;ed critics, were I &s;o di&s;po&s;ed (which I am not) neither my natural or acquired abilities enable me to <HI>bully</HI> tho&s;e who mu&s;t be very ill qualified for their ta&s;k, if they were thus to be intimidated from declaring their real &s;entiments; and on the other hand to effect a degree of humility, and by flattery
<PB N="xiii" REF="12">
to aim at warping their minds, is in my opinion, paying them a very bad com|pliment.</P>
<P>So much for others&mdash;now for my&s;elf:</P>
<P>Never &s;hould I have ventured to appear in this habit before the public, had not the following motives urged me thereto:</P>
<P>Many friends have frequently expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of obtaining from my&s;elf &s;uch par|ticulars as they could rely on, of my pa&s;&s;age through life, and many enemies (for &s;uch I have in common with other men, from the monarch down to the poor cobler) have been indu&s;trious in propagating what|ever reports they thought would be&s;t tend to impede my farther progre&s;s; among the re&s;t, the editors of a periodical publication now on the decline (whether de&s;ervedly or not, let others determine) thought proper to exhibit me as they have done many much more eminent and di&s;tingui&s;hed characters, in a literary portrait, containing a few out|lines
<PB N="xiv" REF="13">
it is true, but with &s;ome features which they mu&s;t have known to be fal&s;e.</P>
<P>After having been repeatedly <HI>threatened</HI> by a very particular friend and others, that if I declined drawing up a narrative, they were determined to do it for me, the fir&s;t mentioned gentleman prevailed on me (as the mo&s;t likely mode to bring it to a period) to devote now and then a &s;pare hour in mi|nuting down &s;ome of the mo&s;t material oc|currences of my life, and to &s;end them to him in an epi&s;tolary form, intending to dige&s;t the whole into a regular narrative for pub|lication, that gentleman however, on pe|ru&s;al was of opinion that it would be additionally acceptable to the curious part of the public, if exhibited to them in the plain and &s;imple manner in which they were written, as thus tending to di&s;play &s;uch traits and features of a &s;omewhat original character, as would give a more perfect idea of "I, great I, the little hero of each
<PB N="xv" REF="14">
tale," than any other mode that could have been adopted, e&s;pecially as many <HI>intelligent</HI> per&s;ons were confident I could not write at all, while others <HI>kindly</HI> attributed to me what I never wrote.</P>
<P>If among the multitude of memoirs under which the pre&s;s has groaned, and with which it &s;till continues to be tortured, the following &s;heets &s;hould afford &s;ome degree of entertainment, as a relaxation from more grave and &s;olid &s;tudies, to an inqui&s;itive and candid reader (tho&s;e of an oppo&s;ite de&s;crip|tion are not to be plea&s;ed with the able&s;t performance) and he &s;hould deem it not the wor&s;t, nor the mo&s;t expen&s;ive among the numerous tribe, I &s;hall e&s;teem my&s;elf amply rewarded; had I, however, been di&s;po&s;ed to be more attentive to entertainment, and le&s;s to veracity, I might to many have ren|dered it much more agreeable, though le&s;s &s;atisfactory to my&s;elf, as I believe the ob&s;er|vation
<PB N="xvi" REF="15">
long &s;ince made to be ju&s;t, that few books are &s;o ill written, but that &s;omething may be gleaned from their peru&s;al.</P>
<P>Should the in&s;ignificance of <HI>my</HI> life in|duce any per&s;on better qualified to pre&s;ent the world with <HI>his,</HI> big with intere&s;ting events, my di&s;po&s;ing of &s;everal large edi|tions of that performance will afford me more <HI>&s;olid</HI> &s;atisfaction as a <HI>book&s;eller,</HI> than any &s;ucce&s;s or emolument which can po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e from this, my fir&s;t, and mo&s;t probably la&s;t, e&s;&s;ay as an <HI>author.</HI></P>
<P>If unfortunately any of my kind readers &s;hould find the book &s;o <HI>horrid dull</HI> and <HI>&s;tupid,</HI> that they cannot get through it, or if they do, and wi&s;h not to travel the &s;ame road again, I here declare my perfect readine&s;s to &s;upply them with abundance of books, much more learned, much more en|tertaining, much more witty, much more &mdash;whatever they plea&s;e, they never &s;hall
<PB N="xvii" REF="16">
want books while L. is able to a&s;&s;i&s;t them; and whether they prefer one of his writing, or that of any other author, he prote&s;ts he will not be in the &s;malle&s;t degree offended: let every author make the &s;ame declaration if he can.</P>
<P>Should my memoirs be attended with no other benefit to &s;ociety, they will at lea&s;t tend to &s;hew what may be effected by a per&s;evering habit of indu&s;try, and an upright con&s;cientious demeanour in trade towards the public, and probably in&s;pire &s;ome one of perhaps &s;uperior abilities, with a laudable ambition, to emerge from ob&s;curity, by a proper application of tho&s;e talents with which Providence has fa|voured him, to his own credit and emolument, as well as the benefit of the community. To &s;uch an one I ever have, and ever &s;hall wi&s;h every po&s;&s;ible &s;ucce&s;s, as it has uniformly been my opinion, that whatever is thus acquired, is more honourable to the parties than the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of wealth obtained with|out any intrin&s;ic merit or exertion, and,
<PB N="xviii" REF="17">
which is too frequently con&s;umed with rapi|dity in the pur&s;uit of vice and di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
<P>One word to my old <HI>friends</HI> the book&s;ellers under <HI>number three</HI> of my dedication. This publication it is to be expected will tend to excite &s;ome degree of mirth in them. Con|&s;cious that I have often been the cau&s;e (however unintentional on my part) of ex|citing le&s;s plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations in them, I will readily allow them full &s;cope; however, ac|cording to the well known adage, <Q>&startq;Let &endq;them laugh who win,</Q> I hope they will indulge me in the &s;ame propen&s;ity of laugh|ing if not <HI>at</HI> them, at lea&s;t <HI>with</HI> them.</P>
<P>As a proof of my friendly di&s;po&s;ition, I &s;hall here add a piece of advice, which I do not he&s;itate to pronounce will, if attended to, entitle them to promotion into my <HI>fir&s;t</HI> cla&s;s of book&s;ellers, and eventually prove more beneficial than a con&s;tant per&s;everance in the mode of conduct they have hitherto pur&s;ued; and tho&s;e who have children will
<PB N="xix" REF="18">
I hope &s;ee the propriety of inculcating the &s;ame doctrine to them for their future benefit; and as I flatter my&s;elf my advice will prove equally productive of benefit to great num|bers of the community at large as to book|&s;ellers. It is this,</P>
<P>If they ob&s;erve any per&s;on by indu&s;try and application endeavouring to obtain an hone&s;t livelihood in that line for which his talents or di&s;po&s;ition have qualified him, never to attempt by dark inuendos, &s;ly hints, and fal&s;e a&s;per&s;ions to injure him, as, if he hap|pens to be a man of a becoming &s;pirit, &s;uch conduct will only tend to increa&s;e his exer|tions, and render him &s;till more cautious to obtain a good character, in &s;o doing their weapons will recoil on them&s;elves, and they will have the mortification to &s;ee him flouri&s;h, whil&s;t they become objects of contempt in the eyes of the public, and will of cour&s;e be avoided by them.</P>
<P><PB N="xx" REF="19">But I forget my&s;elf, from debating whether a preface was really nece&s;&s;ary or not, if I proceed thus I &s;hall produce one as long as my book, as indeed &s;ome of my &s;eniors in author&s;hip have done before me, though not altogether con&s;i&s;tent with pro|priety.</P>
<P>I will therefore conclude with a wi&s;h that my readers may enjoy the fea&s;t with the &s;ame good humour with which I have prepared it; they will meet with &s;ome <HI>&s;olid</HI> though not much <HI>coar&s;e</HI> food, and the major part I hope light and ea&s;y of dige&s;tion; tho&s;e with keen appetites will partake of each di&s;h, while others more delicate may &s;elect &s;uch di&s;hes as are more light and better adapted to their palates; they are all genuine Briti&s;h fare, one di&s;h of French con&s;titution <HI>ragout</HI> ex|cepted. But le&s;t they &s;hould be at a lo&s;s to know what the entertainment con&s;i&s;ts of, I beg leave to inform them that it contains forty-five di&s;hes of various &s;izes, which (if
<PB N="xxi" REF="20">
they calculate the expence of their <HI>admi&s;&s;ion tickets)</HI> they will find does not amount to <HI>three halfpence</HI> per di&s;h; and what I hope they will con&s;ider as <HI>immen&s;ely</HI> valuable, (in compliance with the precedent of a modern author, eminent in the culinary &s;cience) a &s;triking likene&s;s of their <HI>Cook</HI> into the bar|gain.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o prepared a bill of fare&mdash;here it is, they are heartily welcome, and much good may it do them.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have often reque&s;ted me to devote what few lei&s;ure moments I could &s;pare in mi|nuting down &s;ome of the principal occur|rences of my life, with a view, &s;ooner or later, of exhibiting the account to the public eye; who, as you were plea&s;ed to &s;ay, could not but be &s;omewhat curious to learn &s;ome well-authenticated
<PB N="2" REF="33">
particulars of a man, well known to have ri&s;en from an ob&s;cure origin to a degree of notice, and to a participation of the favor of the Public, in a particular line of bu&s;ine&s;s, I may without vanity &s;ay, hitherto unprecedented.</P>
<P>Ever willing to pay a becoming deference to the judgment of a per&s;on of your acknow|leged merits, and whom I have the felicity of numbering among my firme&s;t friends, yet being le&s;s anxious to appear as an adventurer among the numerous tribe of authors, than to continue a con&s;iderable vender of the pro|duce of their labors, I have continually de|layed complying with your kind wi&s;hes.&mdash; By the bye, does the publication of a Cata|logue of Books entitle the compiler to the name of <HI>Author</HI>? If it does, many Book&s;ellers have long had a claim to that di&s;tinction, by the annual publication of their Catalogues, and my&s;elf, as <HI>author</HI> of a very voluminous one every &s;ix months. The rea&s;on for my a&s;king this que&s;tion, is, I la&s;t year ob&s;erved a

certain book&s;eller publi&s;hed his fir&s;t Catalogue with this introduction:&mdash;"As this is the fir&s;t Catalogue ever the AUTHOR made, and is done in great ha&s;te, he hopes inaccuracies will be treated with lenity."</P>
<P>But to return from this digre&s;&s;ion. I &s;hould probably have &s;till delayed compiling my narrative, if the editors of a certain periodi|cal publication, who monthly labor to be wit|ty, had not deemed me of &s;ufficient con&s;e|quence to introduce into their work, what they are plea&s;ed to call a <HI>Portrait</HI> of me! and though it was by them intended as a caricatura, yet I am per&s;uaded it will appear to tho&s;e who be&s;t know me, as a daubing more characteri|&s;tic of the heavy bru&s;h of a manufacturer of &s;igns, than the delicate pencil of a true por|trait painter; and on that account I &s;hould mo&s;t certainly have con&s;idered it as unworthy notice, had they not daubed me with fal&s;e features. This at once determined my wavering re&s;olution, and I am now fully re&s;olved to mi|nute down &s;uch particulars of my pa&s;&s;age
<PB N="4" REF="35">
through life, as, though not adorned with an elegance of &s;tile, will I a&s;&s;ure you po&s;&s;e&s;s, what, to you, I flatter my&s;elf, will be a greater recommendation, viz. a &s;trict adherence to truth. And though no doubt you will meet with &s;ome occurrences in which you may find cau&s;e for cen&s;ure, yet I hope others will pre&s;ent them&s;elves, which your candour will induce you to commend. Should you be able to afford the whole a patient peru&s;al, and think the account meriting the public eye, I &s;hall cheerfully &s;ubmit to your deci&s;ion, con|vinced that you will not,
<Q><L>"With mean complacence e'er betray your tru&s;t,</L>

<P>John Dunton, a brother <HI>Bibliopole,</HI> long &s;ince exhibited a whole volume of dullne&s;s, which he called his "Life and <HI>errors."</HI> The latter term I believe might be a very proper appendage to the title page of the innumera|ble lives which have been, and which will be publi&s;hed: For what man will dare to &s;ay of him&s;elf, his life has not been loaded with er|rors?
<PB N="5" REF="36">
That mine has been &s;uch, I readily ac|knowledge: And &s;hould this narrative be pub|li&s;hed, many perhaps may deem that act another (po&s;&s;ibly the greate&s;t) error. To tho&s;e I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that "to err is human, to forgive divine."</P>
<P>As an additional &s;timulus, I can a&s;&s;ure you as an ab&s;olute fact, that &s;everal gentlemen have at different periods (one very lately) in|timated to me their intentions of engaging in the ta&s;k, if I longer declined it.</P>

<P>IN my la&s;t I hinted that I &s;hould confine my&s;elf to a plain narrative of facts unem|belli&s;hed with the meretricious aid of lofty figures, or repre&s;entations of things which
<PB N="7" REF="38">
never had exi&s;tence, but in the brain of the author. I &s;hall therefore not trouble you with a hi&s;tory of predictions which foretold the future greatne&s;s of your humble &s;ervant, nor with a minute account of the a&s;pects of the Planets at the very au&s;picious and important cri&s;is when fir&s;t I inhaled the air of this bu&s;t|ling orb; for, extraordinary as it may appear, it has never yet occurred to me that any of the adepts in the a&s;trological &s;cience have made a calculation of my nativity; 'tis probable this high honor is by the planets de&s;tined to adorn the &s;ublime lucubrations of the very ingenious Mr. SIBLEY, in the next edition of his &s;tup&mdash; endous work! And here, for the honor of the craft, let me remark, that this mo&s;t &s;ublime genius, has with my&s;elf, to boa&s;t (and who would not boa&s;t of their genealogy in having a prince for their ance&s;tor?) in being a Son of the renowned PRINCE CRISPIN.</P>
<P>A Volume has been written with the title of "The Honor of the Taylors; or the Hi&s;|tory of Sir JOHN HAWKWOOD." But were

<P>But to begin:</P>
<P>Were I inclined to pride my&s;elf in genealogical de&s;cent, I might here boa&s;t that the family were originally &s;ettled at White Lackington, in Somer&s;et&s;hire, which obtained its name from one of my famous ance&s;tors, and give you a long detail of their grandeur, &amp;c. but having as little lei&s;ure as inclination to boa&s;t of what if true would add nothing to my merits, I &s;hall for the pre&s;ent only &s;ay, that I was born at Wellington in Somer&s;et&s;hire, on the 31&s;t of
<PB N="9" REF="40">
Augu&s;t, (old &s;tyle) 1746. My father George Lackington, was a Journeyman Shoemaker, who had incurred the di&s;plea&s;ure of my grand|father for marrying my mother, who&s;e maid|en name was Joan Trott. She was the daughter of a poor weaver in Wellington; a good hone&s;t man, who&s;e end was remarkable, though not very fortunate; in the road be|tween Taunton and Wellington, he was found drowned in a ditch, where the water &s;carcely covered his face: He was, 'tis conjectured,
<Q>"&mdash;Drunk when he died."</Q>
This happened &s;ome years before the mar|riage of my Father and mother.</P>
<P>My Grandfather George Lackington had been a Gentleman Farmer at Langford, a vil|lage two miles from Wellington, and acquired a pretty con&s;iderable property. But my fa|ther's mother dying when my father was but about thirteen years of age, my Grand|father, who had two daughters, bound my father an apprentice to a Mr. Hordly, a ma&s;ter &s;hoe-maker, in Wellington, with an intention
<PB N="10" REF="41">
of &s;etting him up in that bu&s;ine&s;s at the expi|ration of his time. But my father worked a year or two as a journeyman, and then di&s;|plea&s;ed his father by marrying a woman with|out a &s;hilling, of a mean family, and who &s;up|ported her&s;elf by &s;pinning of wool into yarn, &s;o that my mother was delivered of your friend and humble &s;ervant, her fir&s;t-born, and hope of the family, in my grandmother Trott's poor cottage; and that good old woman car|ried me privately to church, unknown to my father who was (nominally) a Quaker, that being the religion of his ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>About the year 1750, my father having three or four children, and my mother prov|ing an excellent wife, my grandfather's re|&s;entment had nearly &s;ub&s;ided, &s;o that he &s;up|plied him with money to open a &s;hop for <HI>him&s;elf.</HI> But that which was intended to be of very great &s;ervice to him and his family eventually proved extremely unfortunate to him&s;elf and them. For as &s;oon as he found he was more at ea&s;e in his circum&s;tances he
<PB N="11" REF="42">
contracted a fatal habit of drinking, and of cour&s;e his bu&s;ine&s;s was neglected; &s;o that after &s;everal fruitle&s;s attempts of my grandfather to keep him in trade, he was, partly by a very large family, but more by his habitual drunkenne&s;s, reduced to his old &s;tate of a jour|neyman &s;hoemaker: Yet &s;o infatuated was he with the love of liquor, that the endearing ties of hu&s;band and father could not re&s;train him: by which baneful habit him&s;elf and family were involved in the extreme&s;t poverty.
<Q><L>"To mortal men great loads allotted be;</L>
<L>"But of all packs, no pack like poverty."</L>
<BIBL>Herrick.</BIBL></Q>

<Q><L>"Children, the blind effects of Love and chance</L>

But to our mother we are indebted for every thing. "She was a woman, take her for all in all, I &s;hall not &s;ee her like again." Never did I know or hear of a woman who worked and lived &s;o hard as &s;he did to &s;upport Eleven chil|dren: and were I to relate the particulars, it would not gain credit. So I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that for many years together, &s;he worked generally nineteen or twenty hours out of every twenty-four; even when very near her time, &s;ometimes at one hour &s;he was &s;een walking backwards and forwards by her Spinning-wheel, and her midwife &s;ent for the next.</P>
<P>Out of love to her family&punc; &s;he totally ab|&s;tained from every kind of Liquor, water excepted, her food was chiefly broth, (little better than water and oatmeal) turnips, pota|toes, cabbage, carrots, &amp;c. her children fared

<P>AS I was the elde&s;t, and my father being for the fir&s;t few years a careful hard|working man, I fared &s;omething better than my brothers and &s;i&s;ters. I was put for two or three years to a day-&s;chool kept by an old woman; and I well remember how proud I u&s;ed to be to &s;ee &s;everal ancient dames lift up their hands and eyes with a&s;toni&s;hment, while I repeated by memory &s;everal chapters out of the New Te&s;tament, concluding me from this &s;pecimen to be a prodigy of &s;ci|ence. But my career of learning was &s;oon at an end, when my mother got &s;o poor that &s;he could not afford two-pence per week for
<PB N="15" REF="46">
my &s;chooling. Be&s;ides I was obliged to &s;up|ply the place of a nur&s;e to &s;everal of my brothers and &s;i&s;ters. The con&s;equence of which was, that what little I had learned was pre&s;ently forgot; and in&s;tead of learning to read, &amp;c. it very early became my chief delight to excel in all kinds of boyi&s;h mi&s;|chiefs: and I &s;oon arrived to be the captain and leader of all the boys in the neighbour|hood, &s;o that if any old woman's lanthorn was kicked out of her hand, or drawn up a &s;ign-po&s;t, or if any thing was fa&s;tened to her tail, or if her door was nailed up, I was &s;ure to be accu&s;ed as the author, whether I really were &s;o or not.</P>
<P>But one of my tricks had nearly proved fatal to me. I had ob&s;erved that <HI>yawning</HI> was infectious; and with a determination to have &s;ome &s;port, I collected &s;everal boys to|gether one market-day evening, and in&s;truct|ed them to go among&s;t the butchers; whi|$her I accompanied them. We placed our|$elves at proper di&s;tances, and at a &s;ignal
<PB N="16" REF="47">
given, all began to yawn as wide as we could: which immediately had the de&s;ired effect; the whole butcher row was &s;et a yawning; on which I and my companions bur&s;t out into a hearty laugh, and took to our heels. The trick plea&s;ed us &s;o well, that two or three weeks after, we attempted to renew it. But one of the butchers, who was half drunk, perceiving our intention, &s;natched up his cleaver and threw it at me, which knocked off my hat without doing me any harm.</P>
<P>I was about ten years of age, when a man began to cry <HI>apple-pies</HI> about the &s;treets, I took great notice of his methods of &s;elling his pies, and thought I could do it much better than him. I communicated to a neighbouring baker my thoughts on the &s;ubject in &s;uch a manner as gave him a very good opinion of my abili|ties for a pie merchant, and he prevailed on my father to let me live with him. My man|ner of crying pies, and my activity in &s;elling them, &s;oon made me the favorite of all &s;uch as purcha&s;ed halfpenny apple-pies, and
<PB N="17" REF="48">
halfpenny plumb-puddings, &s;o that in a few weeks the old pie-merchant &s;hut up his &s;hop. I lived with this Baker about twelve or fifteen months, in which time I &s;old &s;uch large quantities of pies, puddings, cakes, &amp;c. that he often declared to his friends, in my hearing, that I had been the means of extricating him from the embarra&s;&s;ing circum&s;tances in which he was known to be involved prior to my en|tering his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>During the time I continued with this Ba|ker, many complaints were repeatedly made again&s;t me for the childi&s;h follies I had been guilty of, &s;uch as throwing &s;now-balls, fright|ening people by flinging &s;erpents and crackers into their hou&s;es, &amp;c. I al&s;o happened one day to overturn my ma&s;ter's &s;on, a child about four years old, whom I had been driving in a wheel-barrow. Dreading the con&s;equences, I immediately flew from my ma&s;ter's hou&s;e, and (it being evening) went to a glazier's, and pro|cured a parcel of broken gla&s;s; I al&s;o provided
<PB N="18" REF="49">
my&s;elf with a pocketful of peas; and thus e|quipped made fine diver&s;ion for my&s;elf and my unlucky companions, by going to a number of hou&s;es one after another, di&s;charging a handful of pea&s;e at the windows, and throw|ing down another handful of gla&s;s in the &s;treet at the &s;ame in&s;tant, which made &s;uch a noi&s;e as very much frightened many people, who had no doubt of their windows being bro|ken into a thou&s;and pieces. This adventure, together with throwing the child out of the wheel-barrow, produced &s;uch a clamour again&s;t me among&s;t the old women, that I would not return to my ma&s;ter, and not knowing what el&s;e to do, I went home to my father, who, you may ea&s;ily conceive could not afford to keep me idle, &s;o I was &s;oon &s;et down by his &s;ide to learn his own Trade; and I con|tinued with him &s;everal years, working when he worked, and while he was keeping <HI>Saint Monday,</HI> I was with boys of my own age fighting, cudgel playing, wre&s;tling, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Mu&s;t not forget an odd adventure that happened when I was about twelve years of age, as it tends to &s;hew in part my dauntle&s;s di&s;po&s;ition, which di&s;covered it&s;elf on many occa&s;ions in the very early part of my life.</P>
<P>I had one day walked with my father to Holy-well lake, a village two miles from Wellington, where meeting with &s;ome good ale, he could not find in his heart to part from it until late at night. When we were returning home by the way of Rockwell-Green, (commonly called Rogue-Green,
<PB N="20" REF="51">
from a gang of robbers and hou&s;e breakers which formerly lived there) having ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed the bridge, we were met by &s;everal men and women, who appeared to be very much frightened, being in great agitation. They informed us that they were returning back to Rogue-Green, in order to &s;leep there that night. They having been prevented from going home to Wellington by a dreadful Apparition, which they all had &s;een in the hollow way, about a quarter of a mile di&s;tant; adding, that a per&s;on had been murdered there formerly, and that the gho&s;t had walked there ever &s;ince; that they had never before paid much attention to the well-known report; but now they were obliged to credit it, having had ocular demon&s;tration. My father had drank too large a quantity of ale to be much afraid of any thing, and I (who could not let &s;lip &s;uch an opportunity of &s;hewing my courage) &s;econded matters for the poor terrified people to return with us;
<PB N="21" REF="52">
and as I offered to lead the van, they were pre|vailed on to make the attempt once more; but &s;aid, that it was rather pre&s;umptuous, and hoped that no dreadful con&s;equence would en&s;ue, as all the company, they tru&s;ted, were hone&s;t-hearted, and intended no harm to any per&s;on: they moreover added, that "God certainly was above the Devil." I then ad|vanced, and kept before the company about fifty yards.
<Q>"Whi&s;tling aloud to bear my courage up."</Q>
But when we had walked about a quarter of a mile, I &s;aw, at &s;ome di&s;tance before, in the hedge, the dreadful apparition that had &s;o terrified our company. Here it is! (&s;aid I) "Lord have mercy upon us!" replyed &s;ome of the company, making a full &s;top; and would have gone back again, but &s;hame pre|vented them. I &s;till kept my di&s;tance before, and called out to them to follow me,&mdash;a&s;&s;ur|ing them that I was determined to &s;ee what it was. They then fell one behind another,
<PB N="22" REF="53">
and advanced in &s;ingle files. As I proceeded I too was &s;eized with a timid apprehen&s;ion, but dur&s;t not own it; but &s;till kept on be|fore, although I perceived my hair to heave my hat from my head, and my teeth to chat|ter in my mouth. In fact I was greatly agi|tated at what I &s;aw, the object much re&s;em|bled the human figure as to &s;hape, but the &s;ize was prodigious. However, I had promi&s;|ed to &s;ee what it was, and for that purpo&s;e, I ob&s;tinately ventured on about thirty yards from the place where I fir&s;t had &s;ight of it. I then perceived that it was only a very &s;hort tree, who&s;e limbs had been newly cut off, the doing of which had made it much re&s;em|ble a giant. I then called to the company, and informed them, with a hearty laugh, that they had been frightened at the &s;tump of a tree.</P>
<P>This &s;tory cau&s;ed excellent diver&s;ion for a long time afterwards in Wellington, and I was mentioned as an hero.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="54">The plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction I received from the di&s;covery, and the honour I acquired for the courage I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in making it, has, I believe, had much influence on me ever after; as I cannot recollect that in any one in&s;tance I have ever ob&s;erved the lea&s;t fear of appari|tions, &s;pirits, &amp;c. &s;ince.

<P>While I am on this &s;ubject, I cannot re&s;i&s;t the temptation of relating a truly ridicu|lous affair that happened about this time at Taunton.</P>
<P>In the work-hou&s;e belonging to the Pari&s;h of St. James, there lived a young woman who was an idiot: This poor creature had a great aver&s;ion to &s;leeping in a bed, and at bed-time would often run away to a field in the neigh|bourhood called the Priory, where &s;he &s;lept in the cow-&s;heds.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="56">In order to break her of this bad cu&s;tom, two men agreed to try if they could not fright|en her out of it. And one night, when they knew that &s;he was there, they took a white &s;heet with them, and coming to the place, one of the men concealed him&s;elf to &s;ee the event, while the other wrapped him&s;elf up in the &s;heet, and walked forwards and back|wards clo&s;e before the cow&s;hed in which &s;he was laid. It was &s;ome time before Molly paid any attention to the apparition; but at la&s;t up &s;he got." Aha!" (&s;aid &s;he) "a white devil!" and by her manner of expre&s;&s;ing her|&s;elf &s;he thought it was very &s;trange to &s;ee a <HI>white</HI> devil. And &s;oon after &s;he exclaimed, "a black devil, too! a black devil, too!" With that the man who had the &s;heet on, looked over his &s;houlder, and &s;aw (or ima|gined that he &s;aw) a per&s;on all over black be|hind him; the &s;ight of which made him take to his heels. Molly then clapped her hands as fa&s;t as &s;he could, crying out at the &s;ame time,
<PB N="26" REF="57">
"Run, black devil, and catch white devil! Run, black devil, and catch white devil!" and was highly diverted. But this proved a &s;erious adventure to the white devil, as he expired within a few minutes after he had reached his own hou&s;e; and from that time poor Molly was left alone to &s;leep in peace.</P>
<P>About ten years after the above affair, at Wilk&s;come, nine miles from Taunton, a gentleman farmer's hou&s;e was alarmed every night between twelve and one o'clock. The chamber doors were thrown open, the bed cloaths pulled off the beds, and the kitchen furniture thrown with violence about the kitchen, to the great terror of the family, in&s;omuch that the &s;ervants gave their ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s warning to leave their places, and &s;ome of them actually quitted their &s;ervice. This dreadful affair had la&s;ted about &s;ix weeks, when a young gentleman who was there on a vi&s;it, being in bed one night, at the u&s;ual hour he heard his chamber door thrown open, and a
<PB N="27" REF="58">
very odd noi&s;e about his room. He was at fir&s;t frightened, but the noi&s;e continuing a long time, he became calm and laid &s;till, revolving what he had be&s;t do. When on a &s;udden he heard the &s;pirit creep under his bed, which was immediately lifted up, &amp;c. This convinced him that there was &s;ome &s;ub&s;tance in the &s;pirit; on which he leaped out of bed and &s;ecured the door, and with his oaken &s;taff belaboured the gho&s;t under the bed as hard as he could, until he heard a female voice imploring for mercy. On that he opened his chamber door, and called aloud for a light. The family all got up as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, and came to his room. He then informed them that he had got the &s;pirit under the bed; on hearing which, mo&s;t of them were terribly frightened, and would have run off fa&s;ter than they came, but he a&s;&s;ured them, they had nothing to fear: then out he dragged the half-murdered &s;pirit from under the bed. But how great was their &s;urpri&s;e and &s;hame, when
<PB N="28" REF="59">
they di&s;covered that this tormenting devil was no other than one of their &s;ervant girls, about &s;ixteen years of age, who had been confined to her bed &s;everal months by illne&s;s.</P>
<P>This gho&s;t was no &s;ooner laid, than two o|thers alarmed the neighbourhood; one of which for a long time &s;hook a hou&s;e every night, and terribly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the family; at length they all re&s;olved one night to go over the whole hou&s;e in a body, and &s;ee what it was that &s;o agitated the building. They examined every room; but in vain, as no cau&s;e could be di&s;covered. So they very &s;eriou&s;ly as well as unanimou&s;ly concluded, that it mu&s;t be <HI>the devil.</HI></P>
<P>But about a fortnight after this, one of the family being out late in the garden, &s;aw a great boy get in at the window of an old hou&s;e next door, (part of which was in ruins) and &s;oon after the hou&s;e began to &s;hake as u&s;ual, on which the family went out of their own habitation and entered the old hou&s;e where the boy was &s;een to get in; yet for a long
<PB N="29" REF="60">
time they could not di&s;cover any per&s;on, and were ju&s;t turning to come out again, when one of the company ob&s;erved the boy over their head, &s;triding over the end of a large beam that ran acro&s;s both hou&s;es.</P>
<P>It was then apparent that the violent agi|tation of the adjoining hou&s;e was occa&s;ioned by nothing more than his leaping up and down on the un&s;upported end of this beam.</P>
<P>Another apparition had for a long time &s;tole many gee&s;e, turkeys, &amp;c. and although it had been &s;een by many, yet nobody would ven|ture to go near it: until at length one per|&s;on a little wi&s;er than the re&s;t of his neigh|bours, &s;eeing the famous apparition all over white &s;tealing his fowls, was determined to be fully &s;atisfied what kind of &s;pirit it could be that had &s;o great a predilection for poultry. He accordingly went round the yard, and as the apparition was coming over the wall, he knock|ed it down, and found that this terrible gho&s;t was a neighbouring woman, who had put on her &s;hroud, in order to deter any per&s;ons &s;hould
<PB N="30" REF="61">
they by chance &s;ee her, from coming near her. Thus, though &s;he had for a long time &s;ucce&s;&s;|fully practi&s;ed this new way of procuring poul|try, the old fox was caught at la&s;t.</P>
<P>This is &s;o prolific a &s;ubject, that I could fill many pages with relations of dreadful &s;pectres, which for a while have reigned with tyrannic &s;way over weak minds, and at length when calm Rea&s;on was &s;uffered to a&s;&s;ume its power, they have been di&s;covered to be no more ob|jects of terror than tho&s;e I have here noticed. But doubtle&s;s many &s;uch in&s;tances mu&s;t have occurred to you.</P>
<P>It has indeed often a&s;toni&s;hed me, that in this enlightened age, there &s;hould yet remain numbers, not in the country only, but even in the Metropolis, who &s;uffer them&s;elves to be made mi&s;erable by vain fears of preter|natural occurrences, which generally owe their origin to the knavery of &s;ome ill-di&s;po&s;ed per|&s;on, who has a &s;ini&s;ter purpo&s;e to an&s;wer there|by, or to the fooli&s;h de&s;ire of alarming the
<PB N="31" REF="62">
minds of weak people: a practice &s;ometimes (though intended as <HI>fun</HI>) productive of very &s;erious con&s;equences. Now and then, indeed, the&s;e terrors are owing to accident and ridicu|lous cau&s;es. As an in&s;tance, I &s;hall give you the account of a terrible alarm which &s;ome years &s;ince took place in an Ho&s;pital of this city, as related to me by a Gentleman then re&s;ident in the hou&s;e, who was compleating his Medical education, and on who&s;e veracity I can confidently rely.</P>
<P>For &s;everal nights &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, a noi&s;e had been heard in the lower part of the building; like the continual tapping again&s;t a window; which led the night nur&s;es <HI>wi&s;ely</HI> to conclude it mu&s;t certainly be occa&s;ioned by the Spirit of one of the bodies depo&s;ited in the dead-hou&s;e, wi&s;hing to make its e&s;cape that way, the &s;ound &s;eeming to proceed from that particular quar|ter. The dread of the&s;e <HI>&s;agacious ladies</HI> at la&s;t became &s;uch, as totally to prevent their going from ward to ward to do their duty,
<PB N="32" REF="63">
and determined my friend to attempt to lay this perturbed &s;pirit; which however he apprehended would more &s;peedily, as well as effectually be performed by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a good cudgel, than by any exorci&s;ms; he therefore in&s;tead of con&s;ulting the Chap|lain, gave orders the next night as &s;oon as the u&s;ual <HI>dreadful &s;ound</HI> was heard, to give him notice. This you may &s;uppo&s;e they did not neglect doing, though at the &s;ame time they were &s;hocked at his temerity, and appre|hen&s;ive for the con&s;equences. He immediately &s;allied forth, with a candle in one hand, and a good tough twig in the other, accompanied by two of the men &s;ervants of the Ho&s;pital, ac|coutred in the &s;ame manner. The dead-hou&s;e was pa&s;&s;ed; the noi&s;e continued; though it evi|dently proceeded from a window at &s;ome di&s;|tance in the area. When the cavalcade came near the &s;cene of action, the window &s;uddenly and violently broke, without any thing being &s;een. This my friend confe&s;&s;ed, for a moment
<PB N="33" REF="64">
occa&s;ion his making a halt; but as nothing vi|&s;ible had e&s;caped through the area, it occurred to him &s;omething might have made an entrance that way: accordingly he proceeded to the internal part of the building, and on opening the door, the apparition immediately not only appeared, but di&s;appeared, and that &s;o in&s;tan|taneou&s;ly as not to afford time to apply the remedy intended. And what, think you, was this dreadful &s;pirit? That you may exerci&s;e your ingenuity at gue&s;&s;ing, I will here con|clude, with, Dear Friend,</P>

We had been there about a fortnight, when my father in|formed our ma&s;ter, George Bowden, that he would return to Wellington again. Mr. Bowden was then plea&s;ed to inform my fa|ther that he had taken a liking to me, and advi&s;ed him to bind me an apprentice to him, I &s;econded Mr. Bowden's motion (as I had a better pro&s;pect in continuing with Mr. Bow|den
<PB N="37" REF="68">
than in returning to Wellington with my father) and as he offered to take me without any premium and to find me in every thing, my father accepted his offer, and I was im|mediately bound an apprentice for &s;even years to Mr. George and Mrs Mary Bowden, as hone&s;t and worthy a couple as ever carried on a trade.

They carefully attended to their &s;hop &s;ix days in the week, and on the &s;eventh went with their family twice to an anabapti&s;t meeting; where little attention was paid to &s;peculative doctrines; but where &s;ound mo|rality was con&s;tantly inculcated.

<P>AT the time that I was bound an Ap|prentice, my Ma&s;ter had two &s;ons, the elde&s;t about &s;eventeen years old, the younge&s;t fourteen. The elde&s;t had ju&s;t been baptized, and introduced as a member of the dipping Community where my ma&s;ter and his family attended. The boy was a very &s;ober indu&s;|trious youth, and gave his father and mother much plea&s;ure. The younge&s;t was al&s;o a good lad. Thus every thing continued well for &s;ome time after I had been added to the fami|ly. Both of the boys had very good natural parts, and had learned to read, write, keep ac|counts,
<PB N="40" REF="71">
&amp;c. But they had been at &s;chools where no variety of books had been introduc|ed; &s;o that all they had read was the Bible: My ma&s;ter's whole library con&s;i&s;ted of a &s;chool-&s;ize Bible, Watts's P&s;alms and Hymns, Foot's Tract on Bapti&s;m, Culpepper's Herbal, The Hi&s;tory of Gentle Craft, an old im|perfect volume of Receipts in Phy&s;ic, Sur|gery, &amp;c. and the Ready Reckoner. The ideas of the family were as circum&s;cribed as their Library; my Ma&s;ter called attention to bu&s;ine&s;s and working hard, <HI>minding "the main-chance."</HI> On Sundays all went to meet|ing. My Ma&s;ter, on that day, &s;aid a &s;hort grace before dinner, and the boys read a few chapters in the Bible, took a walk for an hour or two, then read a chapter or two more, &s;upped, and went early to bed, perfectly &s;a|tisfied with having done their duty; and each having a quiet con&s;cience &s;oon fell into the Arms of
<Q>"Tir'd nature's &s;weet re&s;torer, balmy &s;leep."</Q>
<PB N="41" REF="72">
I cannot here omit mentioning a very &s;ingular cu&s;tom of my ma&s;ter's. Every morning, at all &s;ea&s;ons of the year, and in all weathers, he ro&s;e about three o'clock, took a walk by the river's &s;ide round Trenchware fields, &s;topt at &s;ome place or other to drink half a pint of ale, came back before &s;ix o'clock and called up his people to work, and went to bed again about &s;even.</P>
<P>Thus was the good man's family jogging ea&s;ily and quietly on; no one doubting but he &s;hould go to heaven when he died, and every one hoping it would be a good while fir&s;t.</P>
<P>But alas! the dreadful cri&s;is was at hand, that put an end to the happine&s;s and peace of this little family. I had been an apprentice about twelve or fifteen months, when my ma&s;ter's elde&s;t &s;on George happened to go and hear a &s;ermon preached by one of Mr. We&s;|ley's Preachers, who had left the plow-tail to preach the <HI>pure</HI> and <HI>unadultered</HI> Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. By this &s;ermon the fallow
<PB N="42" REF="73">
ground of poor George's heart was harrowed up, he was now per&s;uaded that the innocent and good life he had led would only &s;ink him deeper into hell: in &s;hort he found out that he had never been converted, and of cour&s;e was in a &s;tate of damnation, without benefit of Clergy. But he did not long con|tinue in this damnable &s;tate, but &s;oon became one of tho&s;e
<Q><L>"&mdash;Errant Saints, whom all men grant</L>

He per&s;uaded him&s;elf that he had pa&s;&s;ed through the <HI>New Birth,</HI> and was quite &s;ure that his name was regi&s;tered in the Book of Life, and (to the great grief of his parents) he was become a <HI>new creature.</HI></P>
<P>George had no &s;ooner made things &s;ure for him&s;elf, than he began to extend his concern to his father, mother, brother, and me; and very kindly gave us to under&s;tand, that he was &s;ure we were in a very deplorable &s;tate,

"without hope, and without God in the world," being under the cur&s;e of the Law. In the long winter nights, as we &s;at at work together, he proved (in his way) that every man had original &s;in enough to damn a thou|&s;and &s;ouls; and a deal was &s;aid on that &s;ub|ject: Quotations were made from &s;ome <HI>deep</HI> author who had a&s;&s;erted, that there were "infants in hell but a &s;pan long;" and that "Hell was paved with infant &s;culls," &amp;c. As to Morality, George a&s;&s;ured us it was of no avail; that as for good works, they were only &s;plendid &s;ins; and that in the be&s;t good work that any creature could perform, there was &s;in enough to &s;ink the doer to the nether|mo&s;t hell: That it was <HI>Faith</HI> alone that did every thing, without a grain of morality; but that no man could have one particle of this my&s;terious Faith, before he was ju&s;tified; and that <HI>ju&s;tification</HI> was a &s;udden opera|tion on the &s;oul, by which the mo&s;t execrable wretch that ever lived might in&s;tantaneou&s;ly

be a&s;&s;ured of all his &s;ins being pardoned; that his body from that very moment became the living temple of the Holy Gho&s;t, that he had fellow&s;hip with the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and that Spirit was to be their con&s;tant and infallible guide: and that

Unfortunately the good woman had no great talents for controver&s;y; however, George had a very tenacious memo|mory, and employed all his thoughts on the&s;e &s;ubjects, &s;o that John his younger brother, and I al&s;o (two competent judges no doubt) thought that he had the be&s;t of the arguments on the&s;e edifying &s;ubjects, and about five months after George's conver&s;ion John went to hear tho&s;e only true Amba&s;&s;adors from Heaven,

John &s;ung to me, and &s;aid to me a deal in this wonderful &s;tile, of which I did not compre|hend one &s;yllable. But the&s;e extraordinary accounts and di&s;cour&s;es, together with the controver&s;ies between the mother and the &s;ons, made me think that they knew many matters of which I was totally ignorant. This creat|ed in me a de&s;ire for knowledge, that I might know who was right, and who was wrong.
<PB N="47" REF="78">
But to my great mortification, I could not read. I knew mo&s;t of the letters, and a few ea&s;y words, and I &s;et about learning with all my might. My mi&s;tre&s;s would &s;ometimes in&s;truct me; and having three-halfpence per week allowed me by my mother, this money I gave to John (my ma&s;ter's younge&s;t &s;on) and for every three-halfpence he taught me to &s;pell one hour. And this was done in the dark, as we were not allowed a candle, after we were &s;ent up&s;tairs to bed.</P>
<P>I &s;oon made a little progre&s;s in reading; and in the mean time I al&s;o went to the Method|i&s;t meeting, to hear one Thomas Bryant, known in Taunton by the name of the <HI>dam|nation preacher</HI>; (he had ju&s;t left off cobling <HI>&s;oles</HI> of another kind.) His &s;ermon fright|ened me mo&s;t terribly.

At la&s;t, by &s;inging and repeating enthu&s;ia&s;tic amorous hymns, and pre&s;umptuou&s;ly applying particular texts of &s;cripture, I got my imagi|nation to the proper pitch, was born again in an in&s;tant, became a very great favourite of heaven, and was as familiar with the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, as any old woman in Mr. We&s;ley's connection.</P>

<P>THE enthu&s;ia&s;tic notions which I had im|bibed, and the de&s;ire I had to be talking about religious my&s;teries, &amp;c. an&s;wered one valuable purpo&s;e; as it cau&s;ed me to embrace every opportunity to learn to read; &s;o that I could &s;oon read the ea&s;y parts of the Bible, Mr. We&s;ley's Hymns, &amp;c. and every lei&s;ure minute was &s;o employed.</P>
<P>In the winter I was obliged to attend my work from &s;ix in the morning until ten at
<PB N="50" REF="81">
night. In the &s;ummer half year, I only worked as long as we could &s;ee without can|dle; but notwith&s;tanding the clo&s;e attention I was obliged to pay to my trade, yet for a long time I read ten chapters in the Bible every day, I al&s;o read and learned many hymns, and as &s;oon as I could procure &s;ome of Mr. We&s;ley's Tracts, Sermons, &amp;c. I read them al&s;o; many of them I peru&s;ed in <HI>Cloa|cina's</HI> Temple, (the place where my Lord Che&s;terfield advi&s;ed his &s;on to read the cla&s;|&s;ics.) But I did not apply them after reading to the farther u&s;e that his Lord&s;hip hints at.)</P>
<P>I had &s;uch good eyes, that I often read by the light of the Moon, as my ma&s;ter would ne|ver permit me to take a candle into my room, and that prohibition I looked upon as a kind of per&s;ecution, but I always comforted my&s;elf with the thoughts of my being a child of God; and as &s;uch, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to e&s;cape per&s;ecution from the children of the devil, which I very piou&s;ly applied to my
<PB N="51" REF="82">
good ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s. And &s;o ignorantly and imprudently zealous was I for the good of their <HI>precious</HI> &s;ouls, as &s;ometimes to give them broad hints of it, and of the dangerous &s;tate they were in. Their pious good old mini&s;ter, the Reverend Mr. Harri&s;on, I called <HI>"a blind leader of the blind;"</HI> and I once a&s;&s;ured my mi&s;tre&s;s, that both he and his whole flock were in a &s;tate of damnation, being "&s;trang|ers to the hope of I&s;rael, and without God in the world." My good mi&s;tre&s;s wi&s;ely thought that a good &s;tick was the be&s;t way of arguing with &s;uch an ignorant infatuated boy as I was, and had often recour&s;e to it; but I took care to give her a deal of trouble; for whenever I was ordered in my turn to read in the Bible, I always &s;elected &s;uch chapters as I thought militated again&s;t Arians, Socinians, &amp;c. and &s;uch ver&s;es as I deemed favourable to the doc|trine of Original Sin, Ju&s;tification by Faith, imputed Righteou&s;ne&s;s, the doctrine of the Trinity, &amp;c. On &s;uch parts I always placed
<PB N="52" REF="83">
a particular empha&s;is, which puzzled and teazed the old lady a good deal.</P>
<P>Among other places I thought that the &s;ix|teenth chapter of Ezekiel very much favoured the doctrines of original &s;in, imputed righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, &amp;c. and that chapter I often &s;elected and read to her, and &s;he as often read the eighteenth chapter of the &s;ame prophecy, for the &s;ake of the parable of the Father's eating <HI>&s;our grapes.</HI></P>
<P>As often as I read in St. Paul's Epi&s;tles on ju&s;tification by faith alone, my good mi&s;tre&s;s would read in the Epi&s;tle of St. James, &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages as &s;ay that a man is not ju&s;tified by faith alone, but by faith and works, which often embara&s;&s;ed me not a little. However I comforted my&s;elf with the conceit of having more texts of Scripture on my &s;ide of the que&s;tion than &s;he had on her &s;ide. As to St. James, I was almo&s;t ready to conclude, that he was not quite orthodox, and &s;o I did not much mind what he &s;aid.</P>
<Q><PB N="53" REF="84">

<L>"In controverted points can rea&s;on &s;way,</L>
<L>"When pa&s;&s;ion or conceit hurries us away?"</L></Q>
<P>Hitherto I had not frequented the metho|di&s;t meetings by the con&s;ent or knowledge of my ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s; nor had my zeal been &s;o great as to make me openly violate their commands. But my zeal increa&s;ed much fa&s;ter than my knowledge, and I &s;oon di&s;re|garded their orders, and without he&s;itation ran away to hear a methodi&s;tical &s;ermon as often as I could find opportunity. One Sun|day morning at eight o'clock my mi&s;tre&s;s &s;ee|ing her &s;ons &s;et off, and knowing that they were gone to a methodi&s;t meeting, determined to prevent me from doing the &s;ame by locking the door, which &s;he accordingly did; on which, in a &s;uper&s;titious mood, I opened the Bible for direction what to do, (ignorant methodi&s;ts often practi&s;e the &s;ame pre&s;umptuous method) and the fir&s;t words I read were the&s;e. "He has giv|en his angels charge concerning thee, le&s;t at
<PB N="54" REF="85">
any time thou &s;houlde&s;t da&s;h thy foot again&s;t a &s;tone." This was enough for me. So without a moment's he&s;itation, I ran up two pair of &s;tairs to my room, and out of the window I leap|ed, to the great terror of my poor mi&s;tre&s;s. I got up immediately, and ran about two or three hundred yards, towards the meeting-hou&s;e; but alas! I could run no farther; my feet and ancles were mo&s;t intolerably brui&s;ed, &s;o that I was obliged to be carried back and put to bed; and it was more than a month before I recovered the u&s;e of my limbs. I was igno|rant enough to think, (I mention it with horror and remor&s;e!) that the Lord had not u&s;ed me very well, and re&s;olved not to put &s;o much tru&s;t in him for the future.</P>
<P>This ra&s;h adventure of mine made a great noi&s;e in the town, and was talked of many miles round. Some few admired my amazing &s;trength of faith, but the major part pitied me, $s a poor ignorant, deluded and infatuated boy; which did not at all plea&s;e,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the fourth year of my apprentice&s;hip, my ma&s;ter died, and although he was a good hu&s;band, a good father, and a good ma&s;ter, &amp;c. yet as he had not the methodi&s;tical faith, and could not pronounce the <HI>Shibboleth</HI> of that &s;ect, I <HI>piou&s;ly</HI> feared that he was gone to hell.</P>
<P>As I had been bound to my mi&s;tre&s;s as well as my ma&s;ter, I was of cour&s;e an apprentice &s;till. But after my ma&s;ter's death I obtained more liberty of con&s;cience, (as I called it) &s;o
<PB N="56" REF="87">
that I not only went to hear the methodi&s;t &s;ermons, but was al&s;o admitted into their So|ciety: and I believe they never had a more devout enthu&s;ia&s;tical member; &s;o that for &s;everal years I regularly attended every &s;er|mon, as well as all their private meetings.</P>
<P>As you are probably unacquainted with the nature of their private meetings, a &s;hort account of them may perhaps afford you &s;ome amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>The late Mr. We&s;ley in&s;tituted among&s;t his people, be&s;ides the public preachings, &s;everal kinds of private meetings; and as the <HI>prayer-meeting</HI> is the lea&s;t private of any of them, I will fir&s;t take notice of that.</P>
<P>To the prayer-meetings they often invited people who were not of their &s;ociety; an hymn was fir&s;t &s;ung, and then they all knelt, and the fir&s;t per&s;on that felt a motion, made an extemporary prayer, when he had done ano|ther began, and &s;o on, for about two hours.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="88">But it &s;o happened &s;ometimes, that one of the brethren began to pray without having <HI>the gift</HI> of prayer (as they call it), and then he often &s;tuck fa&s;t, like &s;ome of the young orators at Coach-maker's Hall, &amp;c. Prayer-meetings were held in &s;uch high e&s;teem a|mong&s;t them that they a&s;&s;erted, more were <HI>"born again,"</HI> and more <HI>"made free</HI> from all the remains of &s;in," or in other words of their own, "made <HI>perfect</HI> as God is perfect," in the&s;e kinds of meeting, than at public preaching, &amp;c. Thus, as Pomfret &s;ays,
<Q>"The &s;pirits heated will &s;trange things produce."</Q></P>
<P>But 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for you, my friend, to form any ju&s;t idea of the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies, except you had been pre&s;ent at them: one wheedles and coaxes the Divine Being, in his addre&s;&s;es; another is amorous and lu&s;cious; and a third &s;o rude and commanding, he will even tell the Deity that he mu&s;t be <HI>a liar</HI> (dreadful!) if he does not grant all they a&s;k. In this manner will they work up one another's imaginations until
<PB N="58" REF="89">
they may actually be &s;aid to be in a &s;tate of intoxication.</P>
<P>They have another kind of private meeting after the publick preaching on Sunday even|ings, in which the preacher meets all the members of the &s;ociety, who &s;tay behind after the general congregation is di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. To this &s;ociety Mr. We&s;ley gave &s;uch advice as he deemed better &s;uited to a godly few than to a promi&s;cuous multitude of <HI>"outward court</HI> wor&s;hippers."</P>
<P>Their <HI>Love-fea&s;t</HI> is al&s;o a private meeting of as many members of the community as plea&s;e to attend; and they generally come from all parts, within &s;everal miles of the place where love-fea&s;ts are held.</P>
<P>When all are met they alternately &s;ing and pray; and &s;uch among&s;t them as think that their <HI>experience</HI> (as they call it) is remarka|ble, &s;tand up in their place and relate all the tran&s;actions between God, the devil, and their &s;ouls. At &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons as this I have
<PB N="59" REF="90">
heard many of them declare they had ju&s;t received the pardon of all their &s;ins, while Brother &s;uch-a-one was in prayer; another would then get up and a&s;sert that he was ju&s;t at that in&s;tant made perfectly free from &s;in; and then the Spirit is &s;uppo&s;ed to be very powerfully at work among&s;t them; and &s;uch a <HI>uni&s;on</HI> of &s;ighing and <HI>groaning</HI> &s;ucceeds, that you would think they had all lo&s;t their &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>In the Love-fea&s;t they have <HI>buns</HI> to eat, which are mutually broken between each brother and &s;i&s;ter, and they have al&s;o <HI>water</HI> to drink, which they hand from one to ano|ther. The&s;e meetings begin about &s;even o'clock and la&s;t until nine, or after.</P>
<P>In London, Bri&s;tol, and other large places, they have &s;ome <HI>private</HI> meetings, unknown to the community at large. The&s;e meetings con&s;i&s;t of all married men at one time, young and unmarried men at another time: the mar|ried women by them&s;elves, and the &s;ingle women by them&s;elves; and to each of the&s;e

cla&s;&s;es Mr. We&s;ley went, and gave &s;uch advice or exhortations as he thought &s;uitable to their &s;ituation in life, &s;eldom failing to &s;peak much in prai&s;e of celibacy, to the <HI>Maids</HI> and <HI>Batche|lors</HI> under his pa&s;toral care, &amp;c.

<P>THE <HI>Watch-night</HI> begins about &s;even o'clock. They &s;ing hymns, pray, preach, &s;ing, and pray again; then exhort, &s;ing and pray alternately, until twelve o'clock; and then they depart in peace, according to the word.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="93">Mr. We&s;ley, in every place where his peo|ple were numerous, had divided them into <HI>cla&s;&s;es,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of twelve or fourteen bro|thers or &s;i&s;ters. Sometimes men and women met together in the &s;ame <HI>cla&s;s,</HI> (as they called it) and other cla&s;&s;es con&s;i&s;ted of all men or all women. Each of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es had one in it who was called the <HI>leader.</HI> In &s;uch cla&s;&s;es where men and women meet together, the leader was always a brother: and &s;o of cour&s;e when the cla&s;s con&s;i&s;ted of men alone. But in the womens cla&s;&s;es a Si&s;ter was always the leader.</P>
<P>When they met together, the Leader fir&s;t gave out an hymn, which they all &s;ang: after the hymn they all kneeled down, and their leader made an extemporary prayer; after which they were &s;eated, and when the leader had informed them of the &s;tate of his own mind, he enquired of all pre&s;ent, one after another, how they found the &s;tate of their &s;ouls. Some he found were full of faith
<PB N="63" REF="94">
and <HI>a&s;&s;urance,</HI> others had dreadful doubts and fears; &s;ome had horrid temptations; others complained of a lukewarm &s;tate, &amp;c. To each of the&s;e the leader gave a word of com|fort, or of correction in the be&s;t manner he was able. They then &s;ang and prayed again. This la&s;ted about one hour. And every one in Mr. We&s;ley's connexion did, or was expect|ed to meet, each in his own cla&s;s once in a week. In the&s;e cla&s;&s;es each made a weekly contribution towards the general &s;upport of the preachers, &amp;c. Such as were very poor contributed a penny per week, others two-pence, and &s;ome who could afford it &s;ixpence. This money was entered in a book kept for that purpo&s;e, and one in every cla&s;s called the Steward, had the care of the ca&s;h.</P>
<P>I now come to &s;peak of the <HI>Bands,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ted only of <HI>ju&s;tified</HI> per&s;ons; that is &s;uch as had received the <HI>a&s;&s;urance</HI> of their &s;ins being pardoned. In the cla&s;&s;es, both the <HI>awakened</HI> (as they call them) and the ju&s;ti|fied,
<PB N="64" REF="95">
and even tho&s;e that were made <HI>perfect,</HI> met all together, as did the married and the &s;ingle, and often men and women. But none were admitted into any <HI>band</HI> but &s;uch as were at lea&s;t in a ju&s;tified &s;tate, and the married of each &s;ex met by them&s;elves, and the &s;ingle by them&s;elves. About Ten was the number generally put in one Band; all the&s;e mu&s;t belong to and meet in &s;ome Cla&s;s, once a week, when not hindered by &s;ickne&s;s, &amp;c. and they were al&s;o to meet weekly in their Band. When met, they fir&s;t &s;ung, then made a &s;hort prayer: that done, the <HI>Band-leader</HI> informed them of the &s;tate of his mind during the la&s;t week, &amp;c. He then made inquiry in|to the &s;tate of all pre&s;ent, and each related what had pa&s;sed &s;ince they la&s;t met; as what vi&s;itations they had received from God, what temptations from the devil, the fle&s;h, &amp;c. And it is a maxim among&s;t them, that by expo&s;ing to one another what the devil has particularly tempted them to commit will
<PB N="65" REF="96">
make the old fellow more careful how he tempts, when he knows that all his &s;ecrets will be told the next meeting.</P>
<P>The la&s;t time I met in band was in Lon|don; where an old man (near &s;eventy years of age) informed us that he had for &s;everal weeks together laboured under a very griev|ous temptation of the devil, who all this time had been con&s;tantly tempting of him to commit adultery; he farther informed us, that having let too much of his hou&s;e to lodgers, they were obliged to put the maid's bed in the room where he and his wife &s;lept; and that one morning he had &s;een the maid lying a&s;leep, nearly or quite uncovered, and he again a&s;&s;ured us that ever &s;ince that time the devil had been every day tempting him to do that which was nought with the maid. I could not help thinking the old gentleman was right in charging it on <HI>the devil,</HI> as there was little rea&s;on to think it was any tempta|tion of <HI>the fle&s;h.</HI> Permit me to add, that this
<PB N="66" REF="97">
old Buck had a wife about half his own age. By this time I &s;uppo&s;e you have had enough of <HI>band-meetings.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. We&s;ley in&s;tituted another kind of pri|vate meeting for the highe&s;t order of his peo|ple, called the <HI>&s;elect bands</HI>; to which none were admitted but &s;uch as were &s;anctified, or made perfect in love, and freed from all the remains of &s;in. But as I never profe&s;&s;ed <HI>per|fection,</HI> I was not permitted to enter into this holy of holies.</P>
<P>Four times every year new <HI>Tickets</HI> are di&s;|tributed to all Mr. We&s;ley's people through|out the three kingdoms. Their ticket is a very &s;mall &s;lip of paper, with a text of &s;crip|ture on it, which is exchanged every quarter for &s;ome other text. Such as are only in a <HI>cla&s;s,</HI> have a different text from &s;uch as are in a <HI>band,</HI> &s;o that no one can be admitted into any general meeting of the bands, appointed by any of the preachers when he intends to give them an exhortation, nor into any
<PB N="67" REF="98">
particular band, by a common &s;ociety ticket. On the common tickets are &s;uch texts as the&s;e: "Now is the accepted time"&mdash; "Awake thou that &s;leepe&s;t," and &s;uch like. But tho&s;e for the <HI>bands</HI> are in a higher &s;train; as, "Be ye perfect as your heavenly father is perfect"&mdash;or, "Go on unto perfection"&mdash;Ye are children of the light"&mdash;"Your bodies are temples of the Holy Gho&s;t;" and other texts of a &s;imilar tendency.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU now &s;ee what &s;ort of a Society I was got into. In country places particular|ly, they con&s;i&s;t of farmers, hu&s;bandmen, &s;hoemakers, woolcombers, weavers, their wives, &amp;c. I have heard Mr. We&s;ley remark that more Women are converted than men; and I believe that by far the greate&s;t part of his people are females; and not a few of them &s;our, di&s;appointed old maids, with &s;ome o|thers of a le&s;s prudi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="100">There are thou&s;ands in this Society who will never read any thing be&s;ides the Bible, and books publi&s;hed by Mr. We&s;ley. For &s;everal years I read very little el&s;e, nor would I go (at lea&s;t very &s;eldom) to any other place of wor&s;hip; &s;o that in&s;tead of hearing the &s;en&s;i|ble and learned mini&s;ters of Taunton, I would often go four, five, or &s;even miles, to &s;ome country village, to hear an in&s;pired hu&s;band|man, &s;hoemaker, black&s;mith, woolcomber, &amp;c. And frequently in fro&s;t and &s;now have I ro&s;e a little after midnight (not knowing what time of night it was) and have wan|dered about the town until five o'clock, when the preaching began; where I have often heard a &s;ermon preached to not more than ten or a dozen people. But &s;uch of us as did attend at this early hour, u&s;ed afterwards to congratulate each other on the great privilege we enjoyed, then off we went to our work, &s;hivering with cold.</P>
<P>I was fir&s;t converted to methodi&s;m when I
<PB N="70" REF="101">
was about &s;ixteen years of age, and from that time until I was twenty-one, I was a very &s;in|cere enthu&s;ia&s;t, and every &s;pare hour I enjoyed I dedicated to the &s;tudy of the Bible, reading methodi&s;tical books, learning hymns, hearing &s;ermons, meeting in Societies, &amp;c. My me|mory was very tenacious, &s;o that every thing I read I made my own. I could have repeated &s;everal volumes of hymns; when I heard a &s;ermon, I could have preached it again, and nearly in the &s;ame words; my bible had hun|dreds of leaves folded down, and thou&s;ands of marks again&s;t &s;uch texts as I thought favour|ed the doctrines (or whims) which I had im|bibed. So that I &s;tood forth as the champion of methodi&s;m wherever I came.</P>
<P>But alas! my godly &s;trict life &s;oon &s;uffered interruption.</P>
<P>The election for two members of Parlia|ment was &s;trongly conte&s;ted at Taunton, ju&s;t as I attained my twenty-fir&s;t year; and being now of age, the &s;ix or &s;even months, which
<PB N="71" REF="102">
I had to &s;erve of my apprentice&s;hip were pur|cha&s;ed of my mi&s;tre&s;s by &s;ome friends of two of the contending candidates; &s;o that I was at once &s;et free in the mid&s;t of a &s;cene of riot and di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
<P>As I had a vote, and was al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a few ideas above tho&s;e of my rank and &s;ituation, my company was courted by &s;ome who were in a much higher &s;phere; and (probably what they partly intended) in &s;uch company I &s;oon forgot my godly or method|i&s;tical connections, and ran into the oppo&s;ite extreme: &s;o that for &s;everal months mo&s;t of my &s;pare hours were devoted to the
<Q><L>"Young-eyed God of Wine! Parent of joys!</L>
<L>"Frolic and full of thee, while the cold &s;ons</L>
<L>"Of temperance, the fools of thought and care,</L>
<L>"Lay &s;tretch'd in &s;ober &s;lumbers."</L>
<BIBL>Mallet's Eurydice.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Here I had like to have &s;unk forever into meanne&s;s, ob&s;curity and vice; for when the Election was over, I had no longer open hou&s;es to eat and drink in at free co&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="103">However I did not &s;ink quite &s;o low as the commonality of journeymen &s;hoemakers, but in general worked very hard, and &s;pent my money in better company.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding, at times I was very un|ea&s;y, and although I had not been at any methodi&s;tical meeting during the time that I had lived this di&s;&s;ipated life, yet my mind was not freed intirely from the &s;uper&s;titious fears I had there imbibed: &s;o that whenever any per&s;on a&s;ked me, what would become of me (that had lived &s;uch an holy life) if I &s;hould die in the &s;tate of <HI>back&s;liding</HI> from the good old way?" I always acknowledged that I &s;hould be eternally damn'd, were that to be the ca&s;e. But I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I was not much afraid of dying in &s;uch a &s;tate, as I was too much prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the methodi&s;tical no|tions of <HI>free-grace,</HI> that would not let me finally be lo&s;t. So that I waited as it were for a <HI>&s;econd call</HI> to repentance, ju&s;tifica|tion, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="104">I often privately took the bible to bed with me, and in the long &s;ummer mornings I read for hours together in bed. But this did not in the lea&s;t influence my conduct.</P>
<P>I was twenty-one years of age the 11th of September 1767, the election was over the latter end of March 1768. It was in this year that my new ma&s;ter's wife in&s;i&s;ted on my purcha&s;ing milk of a milk-maid that was a cu&s;tomer at the &s;hop; which I refu&s;ed to comply with, as I had a &s;mart little milk|maid of my own. But as my mi&s;tre&s;s wore the breeches, my ma&s;ter was obliged, by his wife's order, to inform me that I mu&s;t comply with the commands of my mi&s;tre&s;s or get ano|ther ma&s;ter. I left him without he&s;itation; and the &s;ame afternoon went to Wellington, to take leave of my father and mother, and to inform them of my intention to go to Bri&s;tol. I did &s;o, and after two or three days I returned back to Taunton, where I &s;tayed a day or two more. In which time I became enamoured
<PB N="74" REF="105">
with, or infatuated by the beautiful <HI>Nancy Trott</HI>: and although I &s;aw the impropriety of the mea&s;ure, yet I could not re&s;i&s;t the fair tempter, who prevailed with me to permit her to accompany me in my journey.</P>

<P>We re&s;ted a week in Bridgewater, where I worked and got money to convey us to Ex|bridge, &s;eventeen miles on this &s;ide Bri&s;tol; and there I &s;aw my conduct in &s;uch a point of view as made me re&s;olve to leave her.

My finances amounted to three &s;hillings and one penny, out of which I gave her half-a-crown,
<PB N="75" REF="106">
and with the remaining &s;even-pence, without informing her of my purpo&s;e, I &s;et off for Bri&s;tol; where I arrived in a few hours, and got work the &s;ame evening.</P>
<P>A few days after, I went to the inn where the Taunton carrier put up, to enquire after Mi&s;s Trott, as I wanted to know if &s;he had returned &s;afe to Taunton. But I was inform|ed that &s;he was in Bri&s;tol nearly as &s;oon as I was, and as I knew but little of the world, and very little of women of her de&s;cription, I was quite unhappy on her account, for fear that being in a &s;trange place, &s;he might be in want and di&s;tre&s;s; which thought induced me to offer to &s;everal of my countrymen, five &s;hillings to the fir&s;t who &s;hould bring me an account where I might find her; but I did not &s;ee her until &s;everal weeks after that.</P>
<P>The Taunton carrier gave me a letter from my good Mi&s;tre&s;s Bowden, (who by marry|ing again had changed her name to Dingle.) The contents of this letter very much &s;ur|pri&s;ed
<PB N="76" REF="107">
me. It informed me that a day or two before I fell out with my la&s;t mi&s;tre&s;s, (which was the trifling cau&s;e of my leaving Taunton) Betty Tucker, a common la&s;s, had &s;worn a child to me; that the pari&s;h officers had been to my ma&s;ter's &s;hop, within an hour after I had left it to go to Wellington, and that they had been at Wellington ju&s;t as I had, lef$ that place, and afterwards hearing that I was in Bridgewater they had pur&s;ued me there. But the morning on which they arrived there, I had &s;et off for Exbridge; and believing that I had intentionally fled before them, they had given over the cha&s;e for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Reflecting on this affair, although my con|duct was &s;o far from entitling me to any par|ticular favour from heaven, yet I was then weak enough to imagine that a kind of mira|cle had been wrought to &s;ave me from a pri|&s;on, or from marrying a woman that I could not bear the idea of living a &s;ingle week with; and as I had not any knowledge of her being
<PB N="77" REF="108">
with child (not having &s;een her for three months before) I had not taken any mea&s;ure to avoid the con&s;equence, but put my&s;elf in the way of the officers: For, as I have ju&s;t told you, after I had taken leave of my father and mother, I went back to Taunton, and walked about publickly one whole day, and part of another.</P>
<P>This girl was delivered about two months afterwards of a &s;till-born child, &s;o that I was never troubled for expences. Methinks you are ready to &s;ay with Pomfret:
<Q><L>"'Tis ea&s;y to de&s;cend into the &s;nare,</L>
<L>"By the pernicious conduct of the Fair:</L>
<L>"But &s;afely to return from their abode</L>
<L>"Requires the wit, the prudence of a God."</L></Q>
This recalls to my mind a ridiculous affair, which excited much mirth in that part of the country.</P>
<P>During the Election at Taunton, a Gentle|man one day came in a po&s;t-chai&s;e to the White-hart Inn, kept by Mr. Bowren, and after having refre&s;hed him&s;elf, &s;trolled into
<PB N="78" REF="109">
the yard, and &s;eeing the ho&s;tler, a&s;ked him if he could inform him where they took in the <HI>news</HI>? The ho&s;tler under&s;tanding him in a li|teral &s;en&s;e, directed him to a Book&s;eller's &s;hop on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the way: this &s;hop was kept by Mi&s;s A&mdash;d&mdash;n, a beautiful young lady of irreproachable character, and one who&s;e fine under&s;tanding and poli&s;hed ta&s;te did ho|nour to the profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Our gentleman on entering the &s;hop enquir|ed of the &s;hopmaid for her mi&s;tre&s;s: but the maid being u&s;ed to &s;erve in the &s;hop, and knowing that her mi&s;tre&s;s had &s;ome ladies with her, informed the gentleman that &s;he could help him to any thing that he wanted. But on his &s;aying he had &s;ome private bu&s;i|ne&s;s with her mi&s;tre&s;s, he was &s;hewed into a back parlour, and the mi&s;tre&s;s being in|formed that a gentleman in the back parlour wanted to &s;peak to her, &s;he went directly to him. The moment &s;he entered the room, he cla&s;ped her in his arms, called her a divine
<PB N="79" REF="110">
creature, &amp;c. This &s;o alarmed mi&s;s A&mdash;d&mdash;n, that &s;he &s;creamed aloud: on hearing of which the ladies, preceeded by the hou&s;emaid and &s;hopmaid repaired to the parlour, where they found mi&s;s A&mdash;d&mdash;n almo&s;t in fits. The gen|tleman thinking that it was only a trick to rai&s;e her price, took but little notice: on which one of the maids ran out and called in &s;everal of the neighbours, who on coming into the parlour, &s;aw with a&s;toni&s;hment our Sir Harry Wildair taking improper liberties with Mi&s;s A&mdash;d&mdash;n, and de&s;ired him to de&s;i&s;t. But he de&s;ired them not to attempt to put tricks on travellers, and ordered them to leave the room. In&s;tead of quitting the room, they in a re&s;olute tone ordered our &s;park to go in&s;tantly about his bu&s;ine&s;s. However he &s;till kept his ground, until the mayor of the town, who happened to live ju&s;t by, was called in. Mr. Mayor demanded to know why he took &s;uch freedom with the lady? Our gentle|man, &s;eeing that the affair began to look very
<PB N="80" REF="111">
&s;erious, now became calm, and informed the company that having an inclination for a fro|lic, he had enquired for a bad hou&s;e, and had been directed there; and added, that if there had been any mi&s;take, he was very &s;orry for it, and would beg the lady's pardon. On hearing this, the company was more &s;urprized than before, and demanded of the gentleman, who had informed him that that hou&s;e was a bawd-hou&s;e? He replied, The <HI>ho&s;tler</HI> at the White Hart. Upon this the ho&s;tler was &s;ent for, and on his being a&s;ked, if he had directed that gentleman, to mi&s;s <HI>A&mdash;d&mdash;n's</HI> as to a bawd-hou&s;e? The poor fellow, with marks of terror and &s;urpri&s;e an&s;wered, "No. The Gentleman never a&s;ked me for a <HI>bawd-hou&s;e,</HI> he only a&s;ked me for a hou&s;e where they <HI>took in</HI> the <HI>news."</HI> So that the ho&s;tler's under|&s;tanding him in a literal &s;en&s;e, cau&s;ed all the confu&s;ion. The affair had got &s;o much air that our &s;park was glad to leave the town immediately.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I TOOK a lodging in a &s;treet, called (I think) Ca&s;tle-ditch, at the hou&s;e of a Mr. <HI>James</HI>; a much genteeler re&s;idence, than com|only falls to the lot of Journeymen Shoe|makers.</P>
<P>In this hou&s;e I found a Mr. John Jones, a genteel young man, ju&s;t turned of twenty-one years of age: He was al&s;o a &s;on of <HI>Cri&s;pin,</HI> and made women's &s;tuff &s;hoes; which he &s;old by the dozen to warehou&s;es. This Mr. Jones and I were &s;oon very intimate; we
<PB N="82" REF="113">
kept our&s;elves decently dre&s;&s;ed, and in gene|ral worked hard, &s;pending our money chiefly in the company of women. As,
<Q><L>"All men have follies, which they blindly trace,</L>
<L>"Thro' the dark turnings of a dubious maze.</L>
<L>"But happy tho&s;e, who by a prudent care,</L>
<L>"Retreat betimes from the fallacious &s;nare."</L>
<BIBL>Pomfret.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>We followed this cour&s;e about four months. During this time Mr. Jones once per&s;uaded me to go with him to the Playhou&s;e, where we &s;aw Shake&s;pear's fine comedy of "As you like it." This was a fea&s;t indeed to me, who had never before &s;een nor read any theatrical production. Words are inadequate to de&s;cribe my &s;en&s;ations on the occa&s;ion. Between the play and the entertainment, (which was the Mayor of Garrat) Mr. Edward Shuter per|formed a &s;hort piece called, "The Drunken Man." This was the only time that I ever &s;aw that extraordinary genius, but he made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on my mind, that 'tis impo&s;&s;i|ble I &s;hould ever forget him.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="114">It is &s;ingular enough, that about this time, although I could not write, yet I compo&s;ed &s;everal &s;ongs, one of which was &s;old for a guinea, &s;ome were given to the Bri&s;tol Print|ers, who printed them, and the ballad-&s;ingers &s;ung them about the &s;treets; on which oc|ca&s;ions I was as proud as though I had compo|&s;ed an opera. My friend Mr. Jones was my &s;ecretary, who before I came to live with him had not the lea&s;t reli&s;h for books, and I had only read a few enthu&s;ia&s;tic authors, and Pomfret's poems; this la&s;t I could almo&s;t re|peat by memory; however I made the mo&s;t of my little &s;tock of literature, and &s;trongly recommended the purcha&s;ing of books to Mr. Jones. But &s;o ignorant were we on the &s;ub|ject, that neither of us knew what books were fit for our peru&s;al, nor what to enquire for, as we had &s;carce ever heard or &s;een even any <HI>title-pages,</HI> except a few of the religious &s;ort, which at that time we had no reli&s;h for. So that we were at a lo&s;s how to increa&s;e our
<PB N="84" REF="115">
&s;mall &s;tock of &s;cience. And here I cannot help thinking, that had fortune thrown proper books into our way, we &s;hould &s;oon have acquired a ju&s;t ta&s;te for literature, and have made &s;ome tolerable progre&s;s, but &s;uch was our ob&s;curity, that it was next to impo&s;&s;i|ble for us ever to emerge from it.</P>
<P>As we could not tell what to a&s;k for, we were a&s;hamed to go into the book&s;ellers &s;hops, and I a&s;&s;ure you, my friend, that there are thou&s;ands now in England in the very &s;ame &s;ituation; many, very many have come to my &s;hop, who have di&s;covered an enquiring mind, but have been totally at a lo&s;s what to a&s;k for, having no friend to direct them.</P>

<BIBL>Thom&s;on.</BIBL></Q>
<P><PB N="85" REF="116">One day as my friend Jones and I were &s;trolling about the fair that is annually held in and near St. James's church-yard, we &s;aw a &s;tall of books, and in looking over the title pages, I met with Hobbes's Tran&s;lation of Homer. I had &s;ome how or other heard that Homer was a great Poet, but unfortunately I had never heard of Pope's tran&s;lation of him, &s;o we very eagerly purcha&s;ed that by Hobbes. At this &s;tall I al&s;o purcha&s;ed Walker's Poeti|cal paraphra&s;e of Epictetus's morals; and home we went, perfectly well plea&s;ed with our bargains.</P>
<P>We that evening began with Hobbes's Ho|mer; but found it very difficult for us to read, owing to the ob&s;curity of the tran&s;lation, which together with the indifferent language, and the want of poetical merit in the tran&s;lator &s;omewhat di&s;appointed us: however we had from time to time many a hard puzzling hour with him.</P>
<P>But as to Walker's Epictetus, although it
<PB N="86" REF="117">
had not much poetical merit, yet it was very ea&s;y to be read, and as ea&s;ily under&s;tood; and the principles of the <HI>Stoic</HI> charmed me &s;o much, that I made the book my companion wherever I went, and read it over and over in raptures, thinking that my mind was &s;ecured again&s;t all the &s;miles or frowns of fortune.</P>
<P>I now began to think of employing my &s;pare hours in &s;omething more &s;atisfactory; and for want of &s;omething to do, I went one evening to hear Mr. John We&s;ley preach in Broad-mead, and as I was compleatly tired of the di&s;&s;ipated way of life I had lived (more or lo&s;s) ever &s;ince I had been out of my appren|tice&s;hip, and as I happened to have no other pur&s;uit or hobby hor&s;e, there was a kind of va|cuity in my mind: In this &s;tate I was very &s;u&s;ceptible of any impre&s;&s;ions, &s;o that when I came to hear Mr. We&s;ley, my old fanatical notions returned full upon me, and I was once more carried away by the ride of enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="118">My friend Mr. Jones &s;oon &s;aw with grief and indignation the wonderful alteration in me, who from a gay, volatile, di&s;&s;ipated young fellow, was at once metamorpho&s;ed into a dull, moping, praying, p&s;alm-&s;inging fanatic, continually reprehending all about me for their harmle&s;s mirth and gaiety.

<BIBL>Hudibras</BIBL></Q>
Nothing is more common than to &s;ee mankind run from one extreme to another: which was my ca&s;e once more.</P>
<P>About this time we left our habitation in Ca&s;tle-ditch, and took lodgings of Mr. Jones's mother, on St. Philips Plain, where lived a Brother of Mr. Jones, who was about &s;even|teen years of age. Soon after we had removed to this place, the Brother, who&s;e name was Richard Jones, was permitted to work in the &s;ame room with my friend and me. They had al&s;o a &s;i&s;ter about twenty years of age,
<PB N="88" REF="119">
who frequently joined our company.</P>
<P>Our room overlooked the Church-yard, which contributed to increa&s;e my gloomy ideas, and I hid &s;o much of the &s;piritual quix|oti&s;m in me, that I &s;oon began to think that it was not enough for me to &s;ave my own Soul, but I ought in con&s;cience to attempt the con|ver&s;ion of my companions, who (I really be|lieved) were in the high road to Hell, and eve|ry moment liable to eternal damnation. And of this charitable di&s;po&s;ition are almo&s;t all the methodi&s;ts, who, as Hudibras &s;ays,
<Q><L>"Compound for &s;ins they are inclin'd to</L>
<L>"By damning tho&s;e they have no mind to."</L></Q>
The frequency of newly-opened graves, which we &s;aw from our windows, furni&s;hed me with opportunities for de&s;canting on the uncertain|ty of life and all &s;ublunary enjoyments, I a&s;|&s;ured them that nothing de&s;erved our atten|tion but what related to our everla&s;ting &s;tate; and that they might, on their repentance, re|ceive in one moment the pardon of all their
<PB N="89" REF="120">
&s;ins, have a foreta&s;te of the joys of Heaven, and know their names were enrolled in the book of life. I farther prote&s;ted that they had no time to lo&s;e; and they all &s;tood on the very verge of hell, and the breaking-brink of eternal torments; and a great deal more of &s;uch edifying &s;tuff.</P>
<P>The younge&s;t brother &s;oon became a con|vert; and Mi&s;s Bet&s;ey was <HI>born again</HI> &s;oon after. But I had a tight job to convert my friend John; he held out, and often cur&s;ed me heartily, and &s;ung profane &s;ongs all day long.</P>
<P>But about four or five weeks after my re|conver&s;ion, John was al&s;o converted, and be|came a favourite of heaven, &s;o that we con&s;i|dered our&s;elves as a holy community.</P>

<P>MR. John Jones and my&s;elf were now greater friends than ever, &s;o that one would on no account &s;tir out of the hou&s;e without the other.</P>
<P>Mr. Jones had the advantage of me in tem|porals, he could get more money than I could.
<PB N="91" REF="122">
But as to grace and &s;piritual gifts, I had much the advantage of all our community; &s;o that I was their &s;piritual director, and if they thought that any of their acquaintance held any opinions that were not quite &s;ound and orthodox, &s;uch were introduced to me, in or|der that I might convince them of their errors. In fact I looked upon my&s;elf as an apo&s;tle, &s;o that whatever I a&s;&s;erted was received as pure go&s;pel; nor was any thing undertaken with|out my advice.</P>
<P>We all worked very hard, particularly Mr. John Jones and me, in order to get money to purcha&s;e books; and for &s;ome months every &s;hilling we could &s;pare was laid out at old book-&s;hops, &s;talls, &amp;c. in&s;omuch that in a &s;hort time we had what <HI>we</HI> called a very good li|brary. This choice collection con&s;i&s;ted of Polhil on precious Faith; Polhil on the De|crees; Shepherd's &s;ound Believer; Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progre&s;s; Bunyan's Good News for the vile&s;t of Sinners; Bunyan's Heavenly

Collings's Divine Cordial for the Soul; Pear&s;e's Soul's E&s;pou&s;al to Chri&s;t; Er&s;kine's Go&s;pel Sonnets; The Death of Abel; The Faith of God's Elect; Manton on the epi&s;tle of St. James; Pamble's Works; Baxter's Shove for a <HI>heavy-a$&s;ed</HI> Chri&s;tian; his Call to the Unconverted; Mary Magdalen's Funeral Tears; Mrs. Moore's Evidences for Heaven; Mead's Almo&s;t a Chri&s;tian; The Three Steps to Heaven; Brooks on A&s;&s;urance; God's Revenge again&s;t Murder; Heaven up|on Earth; The Pathway to Heaven; Wil|cox's Guide to eternal Glory; Derham's Un|&s;earchable Riches of Chri&s;t; his Expo&s;ition of

<P>We had indeed a few of a better &s;ort, as Gay's Fables; Pomfret's Poems; Milton's Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t; be&s;ides Hobbes's Homer, and Walker's Epictetus, mentioned in my former letter.</P>
<P>But what we wanted in judgment in choo&s;|ing our library, we made up in application; and &s;o anxious were we to read a great deal, that we allowed our&s;elves but about three hours &s;leep in twenty-four, and for &s;ome months together we never were all in bed at the &s;ame time, (Sunday nights excepted). But le&s;t we &s;hould over&s;leep the time allowed, one of
<PB N="94" REF="125">
us &s;at up to work until the time appointed for the others to ri&s;e, and when all were up, my friend John, and your humble &s;ervant, took it by turns to read aloud to the re&s;t, while they were at their work.</P>
<P>But this mad &s;cheme of ours had like to have been attended with very &s;erious con&s;e|quences. One night it being my turn to watch; I removed to the fire-&s;ide, to read &s;ome particular pa&s;&s;age, and the candle&s;tick which we worked by not being convenient to move about, and there being no other at that time in the room, I &s;et up the candle again&s;t the handle of a pewter pot, and was &s;o extremely heavy (owing to much watch|fulne&s;s) that I fell fa&s;t a&s;leep and had liked never to have awaked again; for the candle burned down to the handle of the pot, melted it off, and then fell on the chair on which it &s;tood; &s;o that Mr. Jones found me in the morning, fa&s;t a&s;leep, and part of the chair
<PB N="95" REF="126">
con&s;umed; which alarmed us all very much, and made us more cautious.</P>
<P>But &s;till we continued our plan of living, &s;o that we made a rapid progre&s;s in what we called &s;piritual and divine knowledge; and were &s;oon ma&s;ters of the various arguments made u&s;e of by mo&s;t polemical divines, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The better to guard my pupils from what I called <HI>fal&s;e doctrines,</HI> I u&s;ed often to engage them in various controver&s;ies in which I &s;ometimes took one &s;ide of the que&s;tion, &s;ome times the other, in order to make them well ver&s;ed in controver&s;y, and acquainted with the &s;trength of their adver&s;aries. So that I was by turns, a Calvini&s;t, an Arminian, an Arian, a Socinian, a Dei&s;t, and even an Athei&s;t. And after they had &s;aid all they could to confute me, I would point out where they had failed, adding &s;uch arguments as I was ma&s;ter of, and in general we were all &s;atisfied. But when we happened to have any doubts, we had re|cour&s;e

to the Bible and commentators of our own &s;ide of the que&s;tion; and I a&s;&s;ure you, my dear friend, this was a very fine hobby-hor&s;e, which like Aaron's &s;erpent, &s;wallowed up all the other hobby-hor&s;es,</P>

<P>IN the cour&s;e of my reading, I learnt that there had been &s;ects of Philo&s;ophers among&s;t the Greeks, Romans, &amp;c. and I well remem|bered the names of the mo&s;t eminent of them. At an old Book-&s;hop I purcha&s;ed Plato on the Immortality of the Soul, Plutarch's Morals, the Morals of Confucius the Chine&s;e Philo&s;o|pher, and a few others. I now can &s;carce help thinking that I received more real benefit from reading and &s;tudying them and Epictetus than from all other Books that I had read be|fore, or have read &s;ince that time.</P>
<P>I was but about twenty-two years of age, when I fir&s;t began to read them, and I a&s;&s;ure
<PB N="98" REF="129">
you, my friend, that they made a very deep and la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion on my mind. By reading them I was taught to bear the unavoidable evils attending humanity, and to &s;upply all my wants by contracting or re&s;training my de&s;ires.</P>
<P>It is now twenty-three years &s;ince I fir&s;t read them; during which time I do not recollect that I have ever felt one <HI>anxious</HI> painful wi&s;h to get money, e&s;tates, or any way to better my condition: and yet I have never &s;ince that time let &s;lip any fair opportunity of doing it. So that all I mean is that I have not been <HI>over &s;olicitous</HI> to obtain any thing that I did not po&s;&s;e&s;s; but could at all times &s;ay, with St. Paul, that I have learned to be contented in all &s;ituations, although at times they have been very gloomy indeed.

<P><PB N="99" REF="130">The plea&s;ures of eating and drinking I en|tirely de&s;pi&s;ed, and for &s;ome time carried this di&s;po&s;ition to an extreme. The account of Epicurus living in his garden, at the expence of about a halfpenny per day, and that when he added a little chee&s;e to his bread on particular occa&s;ions, he con&s;idered it as a luxury, filled me with raptures. From that moment I began to live on bread and tea, and for a con|&s;iderable time did not partake of any other viand, but in that I indulged my&s;elf three or four times a day. My rea&s;ons for living in this ab&s;temious manner were in order to &s;ave money to purcha&s;e Books, to wean my&s;elf from the gro&s;s plea&s;ures of eating, drink|ing, &amp;c. and to purge my mind, and make it more &s;u&s;ceptible of intellectual plea&s;ures. And here I cannot help remarking, that the term <HI>Epicure</HI> when applied to one that makes the plea&s;ures of the table his chief good, ca&s;ts an unju&s;t reflection on <HI>Epicurus,</HI> and conveys a wrong idea of that contemplative and very
<PB N="100" REF="131">
ab&s;temious philo&s;opher: for although he a&s;&s;ert|ed that plea&s;ure was the chief or &s;upreme good, yet he al&s;o as &s;trongly a&s;&s;erted, that it was the the tranquillity of the mind, and intellectual plea&s;ure, that he &s;o extolled and recommended.</P>

<P>I continued the above &s;elf-denying life un|til I left Bri&s;tol, which was on Whit&s;unday in 1769. I had for &s;ome time before been pointing out to my friend John Jones &s;ome of the plea&s;ures and advantages of travelling, &s;o that I ea&s;ily prevailed on him to accompa|ny me towards the we&s;t of England; and in the evening we arrived at Bridgewater, where Mr. Jones got work. He was employed by Mr. Ca&s;h, with whom he continued near twelve months, and in the end married Mr. Ca&s;h's daughter, a very pretty and very amiable little
<PB N="101" REF="132">
woman, with &s;ome fortune. When my friend was offered work by Mr. Ca&s;h I prevailed on him to accept of it, by a&s;&s;uring him that I had no doubt of my being able to get work at Taunton. But in that I was di&s;appointed, nor could I get a con&s;tant &s;eat of work until I came to Exeter, and of that place I was &s;oon tired; but being informed that a Mr. John Taylor of Kingsbridge (forty miles below Exeter) wanted &s;uch a hand, I went down and was gladly received by Mr. Taylor, who&s;e name in&s;pires me with gratitude, as he never treated me as a &s;ervant, but made me his com|panion: Nor was any part of my time ever &s;pent in a more agreeable plea&s;ing manner than that which I pa&s;&s;ed in this retired place, or I believe more profitable to a ma&s;ter; I was the fir&s;t man he ever had that was able to make Stuff and Silk Shoes, and it being al&s;o known that I came from Bri&s;tol, this had great weight with the country ladies, and procured my ma&s;ter cu&s;tomers, who generally
<PB N="102" REF="133">
&s;ent for me to take mea&s;ure of their feet, and I was looked upon by all to be the be&s;t work|man in the Town, altho' I had not been brought up to Stuff-work, nor had ever en|tirely made one Stuff of Silk Shoe before. Neither &s;hould I have pre&s;umed to proclaim my&s;elf a Stuff-man, had there been any &s;uch workmen in the place; but as there were none, I boldly ventured, and &s;ucceeded very well; nor did any one in the town ever know that it was my fir&s;t attempt in that branch.</P>
<P>During the time that I lived here, I as u&s;ual was obliged to employ one or another of my acquaintance to write my letters for me; this procured me much prai&s;e among the young men as a good inditer of letters; (I need not inform you that they were not good judges) My ma&s;ter &s;aid to me one day, he was &s;urprized that I did not learn to write my own letters, and added, that he was &s;ure that I could learn to do it in a very &s;hort time. The thought plea&s;ed me much. Without any
<PB N="103" REF="134">
delay I &s;et about it, by taking up pieces of paper that had any writing on them, and imi|tating the letters as well as I could. I employ|ed my lei&s;ure hours in this way for near two months, after which time I wrote my own letters, in a bad hand, you may be &s;ure; but it was plain and ea&s;y to read, which was all I cared for: nor to the pre&s;ent moment can I write much better, as I never would have any per&s;on to teach me, nor was I ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of patience enough to employ time &s;ufficient to learn to write well; and yet as &s;oon as I was able to &s;cribble, I wrote ver&s;es on &s;ome trifle or other every day for years together.</P>
<P>But I always wrote as fa&s;t as I could, with|out endeavouring to write well, and that this is my pre&s;ent practice I need not inform you.</P>
<P>I came to this place in but a weak &s;tate of body, however the healthy &s;ituation of the town, together with bathing in the &s;alt water, &s;oon re&s;tored me to perfect health. I pa&s;&s;ed thirteen months here in a very happy manner;
<PB N="104" REF="135">
but the wages for work being very low, and as I had &s;pent much time in writing hymns to every &s;ong-tune that I knew, be&s;ides a number of love-ver&s;es, letters, &amp;c. I was very poor; and to complete all, I began to keep a deal of company, in which I gave a loo&s;e to my natural gaiety of di&s;po&s;ition, much more than was con&s;i&s;tent with the grave, &s;e|date ideas which I had formed of a religious character, all which made me re&s;olve to leave Kingsbridge, which I did in 1770.</P>
<P>I travelled as far as Exeter the fir&s;t day, where I worked about a fortnight, and &s;av|ed &s;ufficient to carry me to Bridgewater, where I worked two or three weeks more. Before I arrived there Mr. John Jones had gone back to re&s;ide at Bri&s;tol, but as &s;oon as he heard of my being in Bridgewater, he and his brother Richard &s;ent me an invitation to come to Bri&s;tol again and live with them.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I MUST now reque&s;t you to go back with me a few years, as I have not yet made you acquainted with my amours. I was about &s;eventeen years of age when an adventure di&s;|covered, that altho' I was &s;o very &s;piritual, as I before informed you, yet &s;till I was &s;u&s;cep|tible of another kind of impre&s;&s;ion. For be|ing at farmer Gamlin's at Charlton, four miles from Taunton, to hear a methodi&s;t &s;ermon,
<PB N="107" REF="138">
I fell de&s;perately in love with the farmer's hand&s;ome dairy-maid.</P>
<Q><L>"Her home-&s;pun dre&s;s in &s;imple neatne&s;s lies,</L>
<L>"And for no glaring equipage &s;he &s;ighs</L>

<L>"Her reputation, which is all her boa&s;t,</L>

<L>"No midnight ma&s;querade her beauty wears,</L>

<L>"An equal pa&s;&s;ion warms her happy &s;wain."</L>
<BIBL>Gay.</BIBL></Q>
<P>At that time I abounded in &s;piritual gifts, which induced this hone&s;t ru&s;tic maid to be very kind to me, and to walk &s;everal fields with me in my road back to Taunton, talk|ing all the way of her &s;piritual di&s;tre&s;s and godly concerns; while I poured heavenly comfort into her &s;oul, and talked &s;o long of <HI>divine</HI> Love, until I found that my affection for her was not altogether of that <HI>&s;piritual</HI> nature. And yet, <Q><PB N="108" REF="139">
<L>"We lov'd without tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing Virtue's bounds;</L>

<P>After this you may be &s;ure that I did not let &s;lip any opportunity of hearing &s;ermons at farmer Gamlin's; and I generally prevailed with Nancy Smith, my charming &s;piritual dairy maid, to accompany me part of the way home, and at every gate I ratified my &s;piri|tual advice with a ki&s;s.</P>

<P>But alas! the&s;e comfortable Sunday walks were &s;oon at an end; as my charming Nancy Smith, for &s;ome rea&s;on or other (I have for|got what) left her place, and went to live as

dairy-maid with a farmer in the mar&s;h coun|try, between Bridgewater and Bri&s;tol, &s;even|teen miles from Taunton. So that I did not &s;ee her for near two years afterwards; du|ring which time I gave advice to another ho|ly &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e name was Hannah Allen.</P>
<P>I prevailed on this lovely maid to attend the methodi&s;t preaching at five o'clock on Mon|day mornings, and we often met at three or four; &s;o that we had an hour or two to &s;pend in walking and conver&s;ation on &s;piritual af|fairs: and had you &s;een and heard us on the cold fro&s;ty mornings, it would have put you in mind of Milton's <HI>Devils,</HI> whom he repre|&s;ents as at times &s;tarving with cold:</P>

<P>But I a&s;&s;ure you, my friend, that we were &s;ometimes like the Galatians of old; we

began in the <HI>&s;pirit,</HI> and ended in the <HI>fle&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>With this dear girl I &s;pent all my lei&s;ure time, for two or three years: &s;o that we en|joyed together hundreds of happy innocent hours.</P>
<Q><L>"My Time, O ye Mu&s;es, was happily &s;pent,</L>

<P>'Tis true I had the greate&s;t love for Nancy Smith. But Hannah Allen had the advantage of Nancy, as I could &s;ee Hannah almo&s;t every day, and Nancy only once or twice in about three years.

<P>After having worked on &s;tuff-work in the country, I could not bear the idea of returning to the leather branch; &s;o that I attempted and obtained a &s;eat of Stuff in Bri&s;tol. But better work being required there than in Kingsbridge, &amp;c. I was obliged to take &s;o much care to plea&s;e my ma&s;ter, that at fir&s;t I could not get more than nine &s;hillings a week, and my wife could get but very little, as &s;he was learning to bind &s;tuff-&s;hoes, and had never been much u&s;ed to her needle; &s;o that what with the expence of ready-fur|ni&s;hed lodging, fire, candles, &amp;c. we had but little left for purcha&s;ing provi&s;ions.</P>

I was not convinced of the ju&s;tice of the claim, but to avoid di&s;pute, I paid him in about two months, during nearly the whole of which time it was extremely &s;evere weather, and yet we made four &s;hillings and &s;ixpence per week pay for the whole of what we con&s;umed in eating and drinking. Strong beer we had none, nor any other liquor, (the pure element excepted) and in&s;tead of tea, or rather coffee, we toa&s;ted a piece of bread; at other times we fried &s;ome wheat, which when boiled in water made a tolerable &s;ub&s;titute for coffee; and as to ani|mal food, we made u&s;e of but little, and that little we boiled and made broth of.</P>

<P>IN a few days after we had paid the la&s;t five &s;hillings of the debt claimed by my friend Mr. Jones, we were both together taken &s;o ill as to be confined to our bed, but the good woman of the hou&s;e, our Landlady, came to our room and did a few trifles for us. She &s;eemed very much alarmed at our &s;ituati|on, or rather for her own, I &s;uppo&s;e, as thinking we might in &s;ome mea&s;ure become burthen&s;ome to her. We had in ca&s;h two &s;hil|lings and nine-pence, half a crown of which we had carefully locked up in a box, to be &s;aved for a re&s;ource on any extraordinary emer|gence.
<PB N="119" REF="150">
This money &s;upported us two or three days, in which time I recovered without the help of medicine: but my wife continued ill near &s;ix months, and was confined to her bed the greate&s;t part of the time; which illne&s;s may very ea&s;ily be accounted for.</P>
<P>Before &s;he came to Bri&s;tol, &s;he had ever been u&s;ed to a very active life, and had al|ways lived in the country, &s;o that in coming to dwell in a populous city, &s;he had exchanged much exerci&s;e and good air for a &s;edentary life and very bad air; and this I pre&s;ume was the cau&s;e of all her illne&s;s from time to time, which at length, as unfortunately as effectu|ually undermined her con&s;titution. During her fir&s;t &s;ix months illne&s;s, I lived many days &s;olely on water-gruel; for as I could not af|ford to pay a nur&s;e, much of my time was taken up in attendance on her, and mo&s;t of my money expended in procuring medicines, together with &s;uch trifles as &s;he could eat and drink. But what added extremely to my ca|lamity
<PB N="120" REF="151">
was the being within the hearing of her groans, which were cau&s;ed by the excru|ciating pains in her head, which for months together defied the power of medicine.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible for words to de&s;cribe the keenne&s;s of my &s;en&s;ations during this long term; yet as to <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> my poverty and being obliged to live upon water-gruel gave me not the lea&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s.

How I &s;upported this long, dreary &s;cene, I

know not; the bare recollection of which is painful, even at this di&s;tance of time. At la&s;t, when every thing that &s;eemed to promi&s;e relief had been tried in vain, &s;ome old woman recom|mended <HI>Cephalic</HI> &s;nuff. I own I had not much faith in it; however I procured it, and in a &s;hort time after &s;he was much relieved from the into+lerable pain in her head, but yet continued in a very bad &s;tate of health; her con&s;titution hav|ing &s;uffered &s;uch a dreadful &s;hock, I thought that no means could be u&s;ed &s;o likely to re&s;tore it, as a removal to her native air. According|ly I left my &s;eat of work at Bri&s;tol, and re|turned with her to Taunton, which is about &s;even miles from Petherton, her native place. But in Taunton I could not procure &s;o much work as I could do; &s;o that as &s;oon as I thought &s;he could bear the air of Bri&s;tol, we returned thither, where &s;he &s;oon relap&s;ed, and we again went back to Taunton.

<P>AT this time I was as vi&s;ionary and &s;uper|&s;titious as ever I had been at any preced|ing period, for although I had read &s;ome &s;en|&s;ible Books, and had thereby acquired a few rational ideas, yet having had a methodi&s;tical wife for near four years, and my keeping methodi&s;tical company, together with the gloomy notions which in &s;pite of rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy I had imbibed during the frequent, long and indeed almo&s;t con&s;tant illne&s;s of my wife, the con&s;equence was, that tho&s;e few ra|tional or liberal ideas which I had before trea|&s;ured

<P>But it was &s;everal weeks before I could firmly re&s;olve to continue in London; as I really was &s;truck with horror for the fate of it; more particularly on Sundays, as I found &s;o few went to church, and &s;o many were walking and riding about for plea&s;ure, and the lower cla&s;s getting drunk, quarrelling, fighting, working, buying, &s;elling, &amp;c.

However I at length con|cluded, that if London was a &s;econd <HI>Sodom,</HI> I was a &s;econd <HI>Lot</HI>; and the&s;e comfortable ideas reconciled me to the thought of living in it. Be&s;ides, &s;ome of Mr. We&s;ley's people gave me great comfort by a&s;&s;uring me, that "the Lord had much people in this city:" which I &s;oon di&s;covered to be true, as I got acquainted with many

I a&s;ked the price; but how great was my a&s;toni&s;hment, when the hone&s;t &s;lop|man told me, that he was &s;o taken with my hone&s;t indu&s;trious looks, that he would let me have it cheaper than he would his own brother, &s;o in one word he would oblige <HI>me</HI> with it for five and twenty &s;hillings, which
<PB N="128" REF="159">
was the very money that it co&s;t him. On hearing this, I cro&s;&s;ed the &s;hop in a trice, in order to &s;et off home again, but the door had a fa&s;tening to it beyond my comprehen&s;ion, nor would the good man let me out before I had made him an offer. I told him, I had &s;o little money about me that I could not offer any thing, and again de&s;ired that he would let me out. But he per&s;i&s;ted, and at la&s;t I told him that my landlord had informed me that he had purcha&s;ed &s;uch another coat for ten &s;hillings; on which he began to give him|&s;elf airs, and a&s;&s;ured me that however &s;ome people came by their goods, that for his part, he always paid for his. I heartily wi&s;hed my|&s;elf out of the &s;hop, but in vain; as he &s;eem|ed determined not to part with me until I had made &s;ome offer. I then told him that I had but ten &s;hillings and &s;ixpence, and of cour&s;e could not offer him anymore than I had got. I now expected more abu&s;e from him, but in&s;tead of that the patient good man told me, that as he
<PB N="129" REF="160">
perhaps might get &s;omething by me another time, I &s;hould have the coat for my half guinea, although it was worth more than double the money.</P>
<P>About the end of November I received an account of the death of my grandfather; and was al&s;o informed that he had left a will in favour of my Grandmother-in-law's relati|ons, who became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all his effects, except a &s;mall freehold e&s;tate, which he left to my younge&s;t brother, becau&s;e he happened to be called George, (which was the name of my Grandfather) and ten pounds a piece to each of his grand-children.</P>
<P>So totally unacquainted was I with the modes of tran&s;acting bu&s;ine&s;s, that I could not point out any method of having my ten pounds &s;ent up to London to me, at lea&s;t no mode that the executor of the will would approve of; it being &s;uch a <HI>prodigious</HI> &s;um, that the greate&s;t caution was u&s;ed on both &s;ides, &s;o that it co&s;t me about half the money in going
<PB N="130" REF="161">
down for it, and in returning to town again. This was in extremely hard fro&s;ty weather (I think &s;ome time in December, and being on the out&s;ide of a &s;tage-coach, I was &s;o very cold, that when I came to the inn where the pa&s;&s;engers dined, I went directly to the fire, which &s;truck the cold inward, &s;o that I had but a very narrow e&s;cape from death. This happened in going down. In returning back to town, I had other misfortunes. The cold weather &s;till continuing, I thought the ba&s;ket warmer than the roof, and about &s;ix miles from Sali&s;bury, I went back into the ba&s;ket. But on getting out of it, in the Inn yard at Sali&s;bury, I heard &s;ome money jingle, and on &s;earching my pockets, I di&s;covered that I had lo&s;t about &s;ixteen &s;hillings, two or three of which I found in the ba&s;ket, the re&s;t had fal|len through on the road; and no doubt the whole of what I had left of my ten pounds would have gone the &s;ame way, had I not (for fear of highwaymen) &s;ewed it up in my
<PB N="131" REF="162">
cloaths. The lo&s;s of my &s;ilver I bore with the temper of a &s;toic, and like Epictetus rea|&s;oned, that I could not have lo&s;t it, if I had not at fir&s;t had it; and that as I had lo&s;t it, why it was all the &s;ame as though it had not been given to me at all.</P>
<P>But a more dreadful misfortune befel me the next morning; the extreme &s;evere wea|ther &s;till continuing, in order to keep me from dying with cold, I drank &s;ome purl and gin, which (not being u&s;ed to drink any thing &s;trong) made me &s;o drunk, that the coach|man put me in&s;ide the carriage for fear I &s;hould fall off the roof. I there met with &s;ome of the jovial &s;ort, who had al&s;o drank to keep out the cold, &s;o that I found them in high glee; being a&s;ked to &s;ing them a &s;ong, I im|mediately complied, and forgot that I was one of the holy brethren, &s;o that I &s;ung &s;ong for &s;ong with the merrie&s;t of them; only &s;eve|ral times between the acts, I turned up the whites of my eyes, and uttered a few ejacula|tions,
<PB N="132" REF="163">
as "Lord forgive me!" "O Chri&s;t! What am I doing?" and a few more of the &s;ame pious &s;ort. However, after eating a good dinner, and refraining from liquor, I became nearly &s;ober, and by the time I arrived in town quite &s;o; though in a terrible agitation of mind, by reflecting on what I had done, and was &s;o a&s;hamed of the affair, that I concealed it from my wife, that I might not grieve her righteous &s;oul with the knowledge of &s;o dread|ful a fall: &s;o that &s;he with great plea&s;ure ripped open the places in my cloaths, which contained my trea&s;ure, and with an heart full of gratitude, piou&s;ly thanked Providence for affording us &s;uch a &s;upply, and hoped that the Lord would enable us to make a good u&s;e of it.

<P>WITH the remainder of the money we purcha&s;ed hou&s;hold goods, but as we then had not &s;ufficient to furni&s;h a room, we worked hard, and lived hard, &s;o that in a &s;hort time we had a room furni&s;hed with our own goods; and I believe that it is not po&s;&s;i|ble for you to imagine with what plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction we looked round the room and &s;urveyed our property: I believe that Alexan|der the Great never reflected on his immen&s;e acqui&s;itions with half the heart-felt enjoyment which we experienced on this capital attainment.</P>
<P>After our room was furni&s;hed, as we &s;till enjoyed a better &s;tate of health than we did at Bri&s;tol and Taunton, and had al&s;o more
<PB N="134" REF="165">
work and higher wages, we often added &s;ome|thing or other to our &s;tock of wearing apparel. Nor did I forget the old book-&s;hops: but fre|quently added an old book to my &s;mall col|lection, and I really have often purcha&s;ed books with the money that &s;hould have been expended in purcha&s;ing &s;omething to eat, an in&s;tance of which follows:</P>
<P>At the time we were purcha&s;ing hou&s;hold goods, we kept our&s;elves very &s;hort of money, and on Chri&s;tmas-eve we had but half-a-crown left to buy a Chri&s;tmas dinner. My wife de|&s;ired that I would go to market, and purcha&s;e this fe&s;tival dinner, and off I &s;et for that pur|po&s;e&punc; but in the way I &s;aw an old book-&s;hop, and I could not re&s;i&s;t the temptation of going in; intending only to expend &s;ixpence or nine|pence out of my half-crown. But I &s;tumbled upon Young's Night Thoughts&mdash;down went my half-crown&mdash;and I ha&s;tened home, va&s;tly delighted with the acqui&s;ition. When my wife a&s;ked me where was our Chri&s;tmas
<PB N="135" REF="166">
dinner? I told her it was in my pocket.&mdash; "In your pocket! (&s;aid &s;he) that is a &s;trange place. How could you think of &s;tuffing a joint of meat into your pocket?" I a&s;&s;ured her that it would take no harm. But as I was in no ha&s;te to take it out, &s;he began to be more particular, and enquired what I had got, &amp;c. On which I began to harangue on the &s;uperiority of intellectual plea&s;ures over &s;en|&s;ual gratifications, and ob&s;erved that the brute creation enjoyed the latter in a much higher degree than man &mdash;</P>
<P>I was proceeding in this &s;train: "And &s;o, (&s;aid &s;he) in&s;tead of buying a dinner, I &s;up|po&s;e you have, as you have done before, been buying <HI>books</HI> with the money?" I then con|fe&s;&s;ed I had bought Young's Night Thoughts: "And I think (&s;aid I) that I have acted wi&s;ely; for had I bought <HI>a dinner,</HI> we &s;hould have eaten it to-morrow, and the plea&s;ure would have been &s;oon over, but &s;hould we live fifty years longer, we &s;hall have the <HI>Night
<PB N="136" REF="167">
Thoughts</HI> to fea&s;t upon." My wife was con|vinced. Down I &s;at, and began to read with as much enthu&s;ia&s;m as the good doctor po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed when he wrote it: and &s;o much did it ex|cite my attention as well as approbation, that I retained the greate&s;t part of it in my me|mory.</P>
<P>Sometime in June 1775, as we &s;at at work in our room, Mr. Boyd, one of Mr. We&s;ley's people, called and informed me that a little &s;hop and parlour were to be let in Feather|&s;tone &s;treet, and added, that if I was to take it I might there get &s;ome work as a ma&s;ter. I without he&s;itation told him that I liked the idea, and hinted that I would &s;ell books al&s;o. Mr. Boyd then a&s;ked me, how I came to think of &s;elling books? I informed him that until that moment it had never once entered into my thoughts; but that when he propo&s;ed my taking the &s;hop, it in&s;tantaneou&s;ly oc|curred to my mind, that for &s;everal months pa&s;t I had ob&s;erved a great increa&s;e in a cer|tain
<PB N="137" REF="168">
old book &s;hop; and that I was per&s;uaded I knew as much of old books as the per&s;on who kept it. I farther ob&s;erved, that I loved books, and that if I could but be a book&s;eller, I &s;hould then have plenty of books to read, which was the greate&s;t motive I could con|ceive to induce me to make the attempt. My friend on this a&s;&s;ured me, that he would get the &s;hop for me, and with a laugh added, "when <HI>you</HI> are Lord mayor, you &s;hall u&s;e all your intere&s;t to get <HI>me</HI> made an Alderman. Which I engaged not to forget to perform.</P>
<P>My <HI>private library</HI> at this time con&s;i&s;ted of Fletcher's Checks to Antinomiani&s;m, &amp;c. 5 volumes; Watts's Improvement of the Mind; Young's Night Thoughts; Wake's Tran&s;lation of the Apo&s;tolical Epi&s;tles; Fleet|wood's Life of Chri&s;t; the fir&s;t twenty num|bers of Hinton's Dictionary of the Arts and Sciences; &s;ome of We&s;ley's Journals, and &s;ome of the pious lives, publi&s;hed by him; and about a dozen other volumes of the latter &s;ort,
<PB N="138" REF="169">
be&s;ides odd magazines, &amp;c. And to &s;et me up in this &s;tile, Mr. Boyd recommended me to the friends of an holy brother lately gone to heaven, and of them I purcha&s;ed a bagful of old books, chiefly divinity, for a guinea.</P>
<P>With this &s;tock, and &s;ome odd &s;craps of leather, which together with all my books were worth about five pounds, I opened &s;hop on Mid&s;ummer day, 1775, in Feather&s;tone-Street, in the Pari&s;h of St. Luke; and I was as well plea&s;ed in &s;urveying my little &s;hop with my name over it, as was Nebuchadnez|zar, when he &s;aid "Is not this great Baby|lon that I have built?" and my good wife often perceiving the plea&s;ure that I took in my &s;hop, piou&s;ly cautioned me again&s;t &s;etting my mind on the riches of this world, and a&s;&s;ured me that it was all but vanity. "You are very right, my dear, I &s;ometimes replied, and to keep our minds as &s;piritual as we can, we will always attend our cla&s;s and band meetings, hear as many &s;ermons, &amp;c. at the

We will &s;till attend the preaching at five o'clock in the morning; at eight go to the prayer meeting; at ten to the public wor&s;hip at the foundry; hear Mr. Perry at Cripplegate, at two; be at the preaching at the Foundry, at five; meet with the general Society at &s;ix; meet in the united bands at &s;even, and again be at the prayer meeting at eight; and then come home and read and pray by our&s;elves."</P>

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the ob&s;curity of the &s;treet, and the mean appearance of my &s;hop, yet I &s;oon found cu&s;tomers for what few books I had, and I as &s;oon laid out the money in other old tra&s;h which was daily brought for &s;ale.</P>
<P>At that time Mr. We&s;ley's people had a &s;um of money which was kept on purpo&s;e to
<PB N="141" REF="172">
lend out, for three months, to &s;uch of their &s;ociety who&s;e characters were good, and who wanted a temporary relief. To increa&s;e my little &s;tock, I borrowed five pounds out of this fund, which was of great &s;ervice to me.</P>
<P>In our new &s;ituation we lived in a very frugal manner, often dining on potatoes, and quenching our thir&s;t with water, being ab&s;o|lutely determined if po&s;&s;ible to make &s;ome provi&s;ion for &s;uch di&s;mal times as &s;ickne&s;s, &s;hortne&s;s of work, &amp;c. which we had been &s;o frequently involved in before, and could &s;carce help expecting to be our fate again. My wife foreboded it much more than I did, being of a more melancholy turn of mind.</P>
<Q>"A &s;ad prophetic Spirit dwells with woe."</Q>
<P>I lived in this &s;treet &s;ix months, and in that time increa&s;ed my &s;tock from five pounds, to twenty-five pounds. This &s;tock I deemed too great to be buried in Feather&s;tone-Street; and a &s;hop and parlour being to let in Chi&s;well-Street, No. 46, I took them. This was at
<PB N="142" REF="173">
that time, and for fourteen years afterwards a very dull and ob&s;cure &s;ituation; but &s;till it was much better adapted for bu&s;ine&s;s than Feather&s;tone-Street.</P>
<P>A few weeks after I came into Chi&s;well-Street, I bade a final adieu to the <HI>gentle croft,</HI> and converted my little &s;tock of leather, &amp;c. into old books; and a great &s;ale I had, con|&s;idering my &s;tock; which was not only very &s;mall, but contained very little variety, as it principally con&s;i&s;ted of Divinity; for as I had not much knowledge, &s;o I &s;eldom ventured out of my depth. Indeed, there was one cla&s;s of books, which for the fir&s;t year or two that I called my&s;elf a Book&s;eller, I would not &s;ell, for &s;uch was my ignorance, bigotry, &s;uper&s;ti|tion, (or what you plea&s;e) that I con&s;cien|tiou&s;ly de&s;troyed &s;uch books as fell into my hands which were written by free-thinkers: for really &s;uppo&s;ing them to be dictated by the devil, I would neither read them my&s;elf, nor &s;ell them to others.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="174">You will perhaps be &s;urpri&s;ed when I in|form you, that there are in London, (and I &s;uppo&s;e in other populous places) per&s;ons who purcha&s;e every article which they have occa|&s;ion for, (and al&s;o many articles which they have <HI>no</HI> occa&s;ion for) at &s;talls, beggarly &s;hops, pawnbrokers, &amp;c. under the idea of purcha&s;ing <HI>cheaper</HI> than they could at re&s;pectable &s;hops, and of men of property. A con&s;iderable num|ber of the&s;e kind of cu&s;tomers I had in the beginning, who for&s;ook my &s;hop as &s;oon as I began to appear more re&s;pectable, by intro|ducing better order, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing more valuable books, and having acquired a better judg|ment, &amp;c. Notwith&s;tanding which, I declare to you, upon my honour, that the&s;e very bar|gain hunters have given me double the price that I now charge for thou&s;ands and tens of thou&s;ands of volumes. For as a trade&s;man increa&s;es in re&s;pectability and opulence, his opportunities of purcha&s;ing increa&s;e propor|tionably, and the more he buys and &s;ells, the
<PB N="144" REF="175">
more he becomes a judge of the real value of his goods. It was for want of this experience and judgment, Stock, &amp;c. that for &s;everal years I was in the habit of charging more than double the price I now do for many thou|&s;and articles. But profe&s;&s;ed bargain hunters often purcha&s;e old <HI>locks</HI> at the &s;talls in Moor|&s;ields, when half the wards are ru&s;ted off and taken out, and give more for them than they would have paid for new locks to any repu|table ironmonger. And what numerous in|&s;tances of this infatuation do we meet with daily at &s;ales by auction, not of books only, but of many other articles! Of which I could here adduce a variety of glaring in&s;tan|ces: but (not to tire you) a few of recent date &s;hall &s;uffice.&mdash;At the &s;ale of Mr. Rigby's books at Mr. Chri&s;tie's, Martyn's Dictionary of Natural Hi&s;tory &s;old for <HI>fifteen guineas,</HI> which then &s;tood in my catalogue at <HI>four pounds fifteen &s;hilling,</HI> Pilkington's Dictionary of Painters, at <HI>&s;even guineas,</HI> u&s;ually &s;old at

<P>At that time I only kept a boy to help in my &s;hop, &s;o that I fear, while I lay ill, my wife had too much care and anxiety on her mind. I have been told that before &s;he was confined to her bed &s;he walked about in a delirious &s;tate; in which &s;he did not long continue, but contrary to all expectation died, in enthu&s;ia&s;tic rant, on the ninth of No|vember, &s;urrounded with &s;everal methodi&s;tical preachers.</P>

but a friend of mine, of who&s;e veracity I enter|tain the highe&s;t opinion, has favored me with an account of a lady, who has to the full as much of the &s;pirit, but without the good-nature of Nancy Lackington. The fact is as follows:</P>
<Q><L>"'Tis true 'tis pity: and pity 'tis its true.</L>
<L>"And tho' &s;trange the &s;tory, yet by G&mdash; 'tis true."</L></Q>
<P>Mr. R&mdash;t, a genteel trade&s;man with whom I am acquainted, having lo&s;t his &s;econd wife early in 1790, courted and married one of the holy &s;i&s;ters a few months afterwards. They had lived together about &s;ix months, when Mr. R&mdash;t, one Sunday, being a &s;ober reli|gious man, took down Doddridge's Lectures, and began to read them to his wife and family. But this holy Si&s;ter found fault with her hu&s;|band for reading &s;uch learned rational di&s;|cour&s;es, which &s;avoured too much of human rea&s;on and vain philo&s;ophy, and wi&s;hed he would read &s;omething more &s;piritual and edi|fying. He attempted to convince her that
<PB N="148" REF="179">
Dr. Doddridge was not only a good rational divine, but to the full as &s;piritual as any di|vine ought to be; and that to be more &s;piri|tual he mu&s;t be le&s;s rational, and of cour&s;e become fanatical and vi&s;ionary. But the&s;e ob&s;ervations of the hu&s;band &s;o di&s;plea&s;ed his &s;piritual wife, that &s;he retired to bed, and left her hu&s;band to read Doddridge's Lectures as long as he cho&s;e to his children by a former wife.</P>
<P>The next morning while Mr. R&mdash;t was out on bu&s;ine&s;s, this holy &s;i&s;ter, without &s;ay|ing one &s;yllable to any per&s;on, packed up all her cloaths, crammed them into a hackney coach, and away &s;he went. Mr. R&mdash;t, poor &s;oul! on coming home di&s;covered his immen&s;e lo&s;s, and in an almo&s;t frantic &s;tate, &s;pent the fir&s;t fortnight in fruitle&s;s attempts to di&s;cover her retreat.</P>
<P>"Three weeks after her elopement, I was (&s;ays Mr. R&mdash;t) <Q>&startq;going down Cheap&s;ide one day, and &s;aw a lady &s;omething like my
<PB N="149" REF="180">
wife, but as &s;he was &s;omewhat di&s;gui&s;ed, and I could not &s;ee her face, I was not &s;ure. At la&s;t I ventured to look under her bonnet, and found, that, &s;ure enough, it was &s;he.

<P>BECAUSE &s;ome of the holy &s;i&s;ters are in their amours altogether &s;piritual, you are by no means to under&s;tand that they are <HI>all</HI> &s;o totally dive&s;ted of the carnal propen&s;ity.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e good creatures are &s;o far from thinking that their hu&s;bands are too carnal in their affections, that they really think that they are not enough &s;o; and in&s;tances are not wanting, in which, owing to their having hu&s;bands too &s;piritual, they have been obliged to receive a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the hu&s;bands of other women.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="183">It is but about a year &s;ince a certain cele|brated preacher u&s;ed to admini&s;ter carnal con|&s;olation to the wife of his clerk. This holy communication was repeated &s;o often, and &s;o open that at la&s;t it came to the clerk's ears, who watching an opportunity, one day &s;ur|prized the pious pair at their <HI>devotion,</HI> and &s;o <HI>belaboured</HI> the preacher with his walking-&s;taff, that the public were for near a month deprived of the benefits re&s;ulting from his remarkable gift of eloquence.</P>
<P>As I am got into the &s;tory-telling way, I cannot re&s;i&s;t the temptation of telling another.</P>
<P>A certain holy &s;i&s;ter who lately kept an hou&s;e in a country village near London, and <HI>took in</HI> (as they called it) Mr. We&s;ley's preachers, [by taking <HI>in</HI> is only meant, that when they came in their turn to preach in the village &s;he u&s;ed to &s;upply each with vic|tuals and a bed; <HI>no doubt</HI> but they &s;lept <HI>alone.</HI>] This lady was &s;o very remarkable for her &s;piritual <HI>experience</HI> and divine gifts, that
<PB N="153" REF="184">
&s;he attracted many to her hou&s;e, be&s;ides &s;uch as came in the regular cour&s;e of their duty, and among the former a preacher from Lon|don, from whom I learnt the affair. This preacher happening to want a wife, and being very &s;piritually-minded, actually married her in December 1790, merely for her great gifts and grace, as her fortune was not above the fiftieth part as much as his own; and as to per&s;on, &s;he is &s;carce one degree above ugline&s;s it&s;elf; although her hu&s;band is well-propor|tioned, and upon the whole a hand&s;ome man. They had not been married a week, when this &s;imple preacher di&s;covered this gifted gracious &s;aint was an incarnate devil, who had mar|ried him only to rob, plunder, and cuckold him. For between her and her gallants, they had bullied him out of a &s;ettlement to the amount of four times the &s;um &s;he brought him, and the poor pious preacher thinks that he has cheaply got rid of her.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on why I intere&s;t my&s;elf in his be|half
<PB N="154" REF="185">
is, becau&s;e I am confident that he really is an hone&s;t well-meaning man at the bottom; but withal one that does not po&s;&s;e&s;s the great|e&s;t &s;hare of under&s;tanding, and who being formerly but a mean mechanic, never had any education, &s;o that although he is a great en|thu&s;ia&s;t, yet he is one of the good-natured inoffen&s;ive &s;ort, who will do no harm to any per&s;on, but will do all the good in his power. I am only &s;orry, as he lately was an hone&s;t u&s;eful trade&s;man, that he &s;hould have &s;o much &s;piritual quixoti&s;m in him, as at thirty years of age to &s;hut up his &s;hop and turn preacher, without being able to read his primer; which upon my honour, is the ca&s;e. But here, my friend, you &s;ee I forgot that the&s;e heavenly teachers only &s;peak as the &s;pirit giveth utter|ance, and that of cour&s;e all human learning is entirely &s;uperfluous.</P>

<P>A few years &s;ince the methodi&s;t-preachers got footing in Wellington, (the famous birth-place of your humble &s;ervant) and e&s;tabli&s;h|ed a &s;ociety there, &s;oon after which one of their preachers (at Collopton, a neighbouring town) happened to like a young &s;ervant girl, who was one of the holy Si&s;ters, &s;he having gone through the new birth, better than his wife, becau&s;e &s;he was an unenlightened, un|converted woman. But this &s;ervant girl hap|pening to be with child, the news &s;oon reached Wellington; and a very wealthy gentleman who entertained the preachers there, followed the preacher of Collopton's example, and got his own pious maid with child. After this

&s;ome of the Society in Wellington began to have all things in common, and &s;everal more of the holy Si&s;ters proved prolific: which &s;o alarmed the pari&s;h, that &s;ome of the heads of it in&s;i&s;ted that the preachers &s;hould not be permitted to preach there any longer.

<P>AFTER a long digre&s;&s;ion, I mu&s;t now return to my own affairs.</P>
<P>I continued in the above-mentioned dread|ful fever many weeks, and my life was de|&s;paired of by all that came near me. During which time, my wife, whom I affectionate|ly loved, died and was buried, without my once having a &s;ight of her. And what added much to my misfortunes, &s;everal nur&s;es that were hired to take care of me and my wife, proved &s;o abandoned and depraved as to have lo&s;t all &s;en&s;e of moral obligation, and every
<PB N="158" REF="189">
tender feeling for one who to all appearance was ju&s;t on the point of death: &s;everal of the&s;e mon&s;ters in female &s;hape robbed my drawers of linnen, &amp;c. and kept them&s;elves drunk with gin, while I lay unable to move in my bed, and was ready to peri&s;h, partly owing to want of cleanline&s;s and proper care. In this &s;tate I mu&s;t inevitably have peri&s;hed, had it not been for my &s;i&s;ter Dorothy, wife of Mr. Northoun of Lambeth, and my &s;i&s;ter Elizabeth, wife of Mr. Bell in Soho. The&s;e kind &s;i&s;ters, as &s;oon as they were informed of the deplorable &s;tate in which I lay, notwith|&s;tanding &s;ome mi&s;under&s;tanding which &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted between us, and prevented me from &s;ending for them, ha&s;tened to me, and each &s;at up with me alternately, &s;o that I had one or the other with me every night; and, con|trary to all expectation, I recovered. But this recovery was in a very &s;low manner.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I was able to enquire into the &s;tate of my affairs, I found that Mr. Wheeler,
<PB N="159" REF="190">
&s;ack and rope-maker in Old-&s;treet, and Me&s;&s;rs. Bottomley and Shaw, carpenters and &s;a&s;h-makers in Bunhill-row, had &s;aved me from ruin, by locking up my &s;hop, which contained my little <HI>all.</HI> Had not this been done, the nur&s;es would no doubt have contrived means to have emptied my &s;hop, as they had done my drawers.</P>
<P>The above gentlemen not only took care of my &s;hop, but al&s;o advanced money to pay &s;uch expences as occurred; and as my wife was dead, they a&s;&s;i&s;ted in making my will in favour of my mother.</P>
<P>The&s;e worthy gentlemen belong to Mr. We&s;ley's Society, (and notwith&s;tanding they have imbibed many enthu&s;ia&s;tic whims) yet would they be an honour to any &s;ociety, and are a credit to human nature. I hope that I never &s;hall recollect their kindne&s;s without being filled with the warme&s;t &s;entiments of gratitude towards them.</P>
<Q><PB N="160" REF="191">

<P>On my recovery I al&s;o learnt that Mi&s;s Dorcas Turton, (the young woman that kept the hou&s;e, and of whom I then rented the &s;hop, parlour, kitchen and garret) having out of kindne&s;s to my wife, occa&s;ionally a&s;&s;i&s;ted her during her illne&s;s, had caught the &s;ame dreadful di&s;order, and was then very danger+ou&s;ly ill, and that people &s;hunned the hou&s;e as much as though the plague was in it. So that when I opened my &s;hop again, I was &s;tared at as though I had come back from the other world; and it was a con&s;iderable time before many of my former cu&s;tomers could credit that I really was in exi&s;tence, it having been repeatedly reported that I was dead.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="192">Mi&s;s Dorcas Turton, was a charming young woman, and you mu&s;t now be made farther acquainted with her. She was the daughter of Mr. Samuel Turton of Stafford|&s;hire, her mother did not by marrying change her name, which was Mi&s;s Jemima Turton, of Oxford&s;hire, Mr. Samuel Turton had a large fortune of his own, and about twenty thou|&s;and pounds with his wife Mi&s;s Jemima, but by an unhappy turn for gaming he di&s;&s;ipated nearly the whole of it, and was obliged to have recour&s;e to trade to help to &s;upport his family.</P>
<Q><L>"'Tis lo&s;t at dice, what ancient honour won,</L>
<L>"Hard, when the father plays away the &s;on!</L></Q>
<P>He opened a &s;hop as a Sadler's Ironmonger, but as he was but little acquainted with trade, and as his old propen&s;ity to gaming never quitted him, it is no wonder that he did not &s;ucceed in his bu&s;ine&s;s; and to crown all his other follies, he was bound for a fal&s;e friend in a large &s;um; this compleated his ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="193">His wife died in Jan. 1773, and his final ruin en&s;ued a few months after; &s;o that from that time to his death he was partly &s;upported by his daughter Mi&s;s Dorcas Turton, who cheerfully &s;ubmitted to keep a &s;chool, and worked very hard at plain work, by which means &s;he kept her father from want. The old gentleman died a few months after I came into the &s;hop. Being partly acquainted with this young lady's goodne&s;s to her father, I concluded that &s;o good a daughter was very likely to make a good wife; I al&s;o knew that &s;he was immoderately fond of books, and would frequently read until morning; this turn of mind in her was the greate&s;t of all recommendations to me, who having acquir|ed a few ideas, was at that time re&s;tle&s;s to increa&s;e them: &s;o that I was in raptures with the bare thoughts of having a woman to read with, and al&s;o to read to me.</P>

<P>I AM now in February 1776, arrived at an important period of my life. Being lately recovered from a very painful, dangerous, and hopele&s;s illne&s;s, I found my&s;elf once more in a confirmed &s;tate of health, &s;urrounded by my little &s;tock in trade, which was but ju&s;t &s;aved from thieves, and which to me was an immen&s;e trea&s;ure. Add to the above, my having won a &s;econd time in a game where the odds were &s;o much again&s;t me; or to u&s;e ano|ther &s;imile, my having drawn another prize in the lottery of wedlock, and thus repaired the

<BIBL>Hayward.</BIBL></Q>
<P>On reflecting on the above united circum|&s;tances, I found in my mind an unu&s;ual &s;en|&s;ation, &s;uch as until then I was a &s;tranger to: my mind began to expand, intellectual light add plea&s;ure broke in and di&s;pelled the gloom of fanatical melancholy; the &s;our|ne&s;s of my natural temper (which had been much increa&s;ed by &s;uper&s;tition, which Swift calls, "the &s;pleen of the &s;oul,") in part gave way, and was &s;ucceeded by cheerfulne&s;s, and &s;ome degree of good-nature.</P>
<P>It was in one of the&s;e cheerful moods that I one day took up the Life of John Bun|cle;
<PB N="166" REF="197">
and it is impo&s;&s;ible for my friend to imagine with what eagerne&s;s and plea&s;ure I read through the whole four volumes of this &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ing work; it was wrote by the late Mr. Amory of Wakefield, and I know not of any work more proper to be put into the hands of a poor ignorant bigotted &s;uper&s;titious methodi&s;t; but the misfortune is, that &s;carce any of them will read any thing but what &s;uits with their own narrow notions, &s;o that they &s;hut them&s;elves up in darkne&s;s, and ex|clude every ray of intellectual light; which puts me in mind of the enthu&s;ia&s;ts on the banks of the Ganges, who will not look at any thing beyond the tip of their no&s;es. By the time I had gone through the la&s;t volume,
<Q>"My &s;oul had took its freedom up." <BIBL>Green.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>I now began to enjoy many innocent plea|&s;ures and recreations in life, without the fear of being eternally damn'd for a laugh, a joke, or for &s;pending a &s;ociable evening with a few friends, going to the play-hou&s;e, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>

<P>I am not in the lea&s;t unea&s;y on that head, as I have no doubt of being in my la&s;t mo|ments able to adopt the prayer of one of the greate&s;t men that ever exi&s;ted:</P>

<L>"The God who&s;e favours made my bli&s;s o'erflow,</L>
<L>"Has doom'd me, after death, to endle&s;s woe.</L></Q>
<P>Having begun to think rationally, and rea|&s;on freely on religious matters, you may be &s;ure I did not long remain in Mr. We&s;ley's Society; and what is remarkable, I well re|member that &s;ome years before, Mr. We&s;ley told his Society in Broadmead, Bri&s;tol, in my hearing, that he could never keep a book&s;eller &s;ix months in his flock. He was then pointing out the danger that attended clo&s;e rea&s;oning in matters of religion and &s;piritual concerns, in reading controver&s;ies, &amp;c. at that time I had not the lea&s;t idea of my ever becoming a Book&s;eller: but I no &s;ooner began to give &s;cope to my rea&s;oning faculties than the above remarkable a&s;&s;ertion occurred to my mind.</P>
<P>But that which rather ha&s;tened my de|parture from methodi&s;m was this. The
<PB N="169" REF="200">
methodi&s;t preachers were continually repro|bating the practice of ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es keeping &s;ervants at home on &s;undays, to dre&s;s dinners, which prevented them from hearing the Word of God (by the Word of God they mean their own jargon of non&s;en&s;e), a&s;&s;uring them if the &s;ouls of &s;uch &s;ervants were damn|ed, they might in a great mea&s;ure lay their damnation at the doors of &s;uch ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, who rather than eat a cold dinner, would be guilty of breaking the &s;abbath, and ri&s;king the &s;ouls of their &s;ervants. But how great was my &s;urprize on di&s;covering that the&s;e very men who were continually preaching up fa&s;ting, ab&s;tinence, &amp;c. to their congrega|tions, and who wanted others to dine off cold dinners, or eat bread and chee&s;e, &amp;c. would them&s;elves not even <HI>&s;up,</HI> without roa&s;ted fowls, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This I found to be fact, as I &s;everal times had occa&s;ion after preaching to go into the kitchen behind the <HI>old Foundry</HI> (which at
<PB N="170" REF="201">
that time was Mr, We&s;ley's preaching hou&s;e;) there I &s;aw women who had been kept from hearing the &s;ermon, &amp;c. by being employed in roa&s;ting fowls, and otherwi&s;e providing good &s;uppers, for the preachers.</P>
<P>So &s;aid I, "you lay burthens on other men's &s;houlders, but will not &s;o much as touch them your&s;elves with one of your fin|gers."

Many would call in and take me a&s;ide, and after making rueful faces, would addre&s;s me with,

"Oh, brother Lackington! I am very &s;orry to find that you who begun in the Spirit are now like to end in the fle&s;h. Pray Brother, do remember Lot's wife." Another would interrupt me in my bu&s;ine&s;s, to tell me, that "he that putteth his hand to the plough, and looketh back, is unfit for the kingdom." Another has ju&s;t called as he was pa&s;&s;ing by, to caution me again&s;t the bewitching &s;nares of pro&s;perity. Others again called to know if I was as happy then as I was when I con|&s;tantly &s;ought the Lord with my brethren, in prayer meeting, in cla&s;s, in band, &amp;c. When I a&s;&s;ured them that I was more happy, they in a very &s;olem manner a&s;&s;ured me, that I was under a very great delu&s;ion of the devil; and when I by chance happened to laugh at their enthu&s;ia&s;tic rant, &s;ome have run out of my &s;hop, declaring that they were afraid to &s;tay under the &s;ame roof with me, le&s;t the hou&s;e &s;hould fall on their heads.

<P>Mr. E. a gentleman of my acquaintance, going through &s;ome alley, one Sunday, hear|ing a very uncommon noi&s;e, was led by curi|o&s;ity to the hou&s;e from whence it proceeded, and there he &s;aw elevated above an a&s;&s;embly of old women, &amp;c. this taylor, &s;tript in his &s;hirt, with his wig off, &s;weating, foaming at the mouth, and bellowing like a baited bull.

Others advi&s;ed me to take care of &s;inning again&s;t light and knowledge, and piou&s;ly hoped that it was not quite <HI>too late</HI>; that I had not (they hoped) committed the <HI>unpardonable</HI> &s;in again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t.

<P>IT being generally known that I had for many years been a &s;trict methodi&s;t, &s;ince I have freed my&s;elf from their &s;hackles, I have been often a&s;ked if I did not believe or rather know, that the methodi&s;ts were a vile &s;ect of hypocrites altogether? My reply has been uni|formly in the negative. I am certain that they are not in general &s;o. The major part of them indeed are very ignorant, (as is the ca&s;e with enthu&s;ia&s;ts of every religion.) But I
<PB N="180" REF="211">
believe that a great number of the methodi&s;ts are &s;incere, hone&s;t, friendly people. It may however be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that many artful, &s;ly, de&s;igning people, having noticed their character, connections, &amp;c. and know|ing that a religious per&s;on is in general &s;up|po&s;ed to be hone&s;t and con&s;cientious, have been induced to join their &s;ocieties, and by a&s;&s;um|ing an appearance of extraordinary &s;anctity, have the better been enabled to cheat and de|fraud &s;uch as were not guarded again&s;t their hypocritical wiles.</P>

<P>I have al&s;o rea&s;on to believe that there are not a few, who think that they can as it were afford to cheat and defraud, on the &s;core of having right notions of religion in their <HI>heads,</HI> hearing what they deem orthodox teachers, going to prayer-meetings, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="212">There are again, others, who think, that grace is &s;o free and &s;o ea&s;y to be had, or in other words, that as they can have pardon for all kinds of &s;ins, and that at any time whenever they plea&s;e, they under this idea make very little con&s;cience of running up large &s;cores, to which practice I fear &s;uch doctrines as I noticed in my la&s;t, from the pen of Mr. Hill, have not a little contributed.</P>
<P>I have often thought that great hurt has been done to Society by the methodi&s;t preach|ers, both in town and country, attending condemned Malefactors, as by their fanatical conver&s;ation, vi&s;ionary hymns, bold and impious applications of the &s;criptures, &amp;c. many dreadful offenders again&s;t law and ju&s;|tice, have had their pa&s;&s;ions and imaginations &s;o worked upon, that they have been &s;ent to the other world in &s;uch raptures, as would better become martyrs innocently &s;uffering in a glorious cau&s;e, than criminals of the fir&s;t magnitude.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="213">A great number of narratives of the&s;e &s;ud|den conver&s;ions and triumphant exits have been compiled, many of them publi&s;hed, and circulated with the greate&s;t avidity, to the private emolument of the editors, and doubt|le&s;s to the great edification of all &s;inners, long habituated to a cour&s;e of villainous depreda|tions on the lives and properties of the hone&s;t part of the community; and many &s;uch ac|counts as have not appeared in print, have been a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly proclaimed in all the method|i&s;t chapels and barns, throughout the three kingdoms; by which the good and pious of every denomination have been &s;candalized, and notorious offenders encouraged to per&s;evere, tru&s;ting &s;ooner or later, to be honoured with a &s;imilar degree of notice, and thus by a kind of legerdemain be &s;uddenly transformed into &s;aints.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t ob&s;erve farther, that the unguarded manner in which the methodi&s;t preachers make tenders of pardon and &s;alvation, has in|duced
<PB N="183" REF="214">
many to join their fraternity, who&s;e con&s;ciences wanted very large plai&s;ters indeed! many of tho&s;e had need to be put under cour&s;es of mortification and penance; but they generally adopt another method, and make them&s;elves as ridiculous by affecting to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;queami&s;h con&s;ciences, as they had before rendered them&s;elves odious by di&s;playing a very oppo&s;ite di&s;po&s;ition. As a friend, per|mit me to advi&s;e you never to purcha&s;e any thing at a &s;hop where the ma&s;ter of it crams any of his pious non&s;en&s;e into his &s;hop-bill, &amp;c. as you may be a&s;&s;ured you will nine times out of ten find them, in the end, errant hypo|crites; and as &s;uch, they make no &s;cruple of cheating in the way of trade, if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>This puts me in mind of one of the&s;e pious brethren in Petticoat-lane, who wrote in his &s;hop-window, "Rumps and Burs &s;old here, and Baked Sheep's heads will be continued every night, <HI>if the Lord permit."</HI> The Lord had no objection; &s;o Rumps, Burs, and Baked

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is very remarkable, that while I was writing the la&s;t five lines of my former letter to you, on Wedne&s;day the 2d of March 1791, I received the news of the death of Mr. John We&s;ley, who I am informed, died that morning at his own hou&s;e, in the City-road, Moorfields, in the Eighty-eighth year
<PB N="187" REF="218">
of his age. He had no illne&s;s, but the wheels of the machine being worn out, it &s;topt of cour&s;e. As I am on the &s;ubject of Method|i&s;m, I hope you will not deem it impertinent, if I devote a few lines to this great parent of a numerous &s;ect, whom I well knew, and feel a plea&s;ure in &s;peaking of with &s;ome re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Several days preceding his interment, being laid in his coffin, in his gown and band, he was expo&s;ed to the view of his friends and the public; and I &s;uppo&s;e that forty or fifty thou|&s;and per&s;ons had a &s;ight of him. But the concour&s;e of people was &s;o great, that many were glad to get out of the crowd without &s;eeing him at all; and although many con|&s;tables were pre&s;ent, yet the pick-pockets contrived to ea&s;e numbers of their pur&s;es, watches, &amp;c.</P>
<P>To prevent as much as po&s;&s;ible the dread|ful effects of a mob, he was interred on Wed|ne&s;day March the 9th, between five and &s;ix
<PB N="188" REF="219">
o'clock in the morning, in the burial-ground behind his own chapel in the City-road. After which Dr. Whitehead (the phy&s;ician) preach|ed his funeral &s;ermon; but notwith&s;tanding the early hour, many thou&s;ands attended more than the chapel would hold, although it is very large.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as it was known that Mr. We&s;ley was decea&s;ed, a number of needy brethren deemed it a fair opportunity of profiting by it, and each immediately &s;et his ingenuity to work to compo&s;e what he cho&s;e to call a <HI>Life</HI> of him; and for &s;ome weeks &s;ince the funeral the Chapel-yard and its vicinity has exhibited a truly ludicrous &s;cene, on every night of preaching, owing to the different writers and venders of the&s;e ha&s;ty performances exerting them&s;elves to &s;ecure a good &s;ale; one bawling out, that <HI>his</HI> is the <HI>right</HI> life, a &s;econd with a pious &s;hake of the head, declares <HI>his</HI> the real life, a third prote&s;ts <HI>he</HI> has got the <HI>only genuine</HI> account; and a fourth calls them all
<PB N="189" REF="220">
vile cheats and impo&s;tors, &amp;c. &s;o that between all the&s;e competitors, the &s;aints are &s;o divided and perplexed in their opinions, that &s;ome de|cline purcha&s;ing either, others willing "to try all and keep that which is good," buy of each of the&s;e re&s;pectable venders of the life and la&s;t account of that celebrated character; while the unintere&s;ted pa&s;&s;enger is apt to form a conclu&s;ion that the hou&s;e of prayer, is again become a den of thieves. Thus we &s;ee tho&s;e holy candidates for heaven are &s;o influenced by &s;elf-intere&s;t, that it

<P>I cannot help thinking that Mr. John We&s;ley, the Father of the Methodi&s;ts, was one of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable enthu&s;ia&s;ts that ever lived; as he unque&s;tionably believed all that he taught others, and lived the &s;ame truly pious exemplary life, that he would have his followers practi&s;e. The &s;ale of his
<PB N="190" REF="221">
numerous writings produced nett profits to the amount of near two THOUSAND POUNDS per annum; and the weekly collection of the cla&s;&s;es in London and We&s;tmin&s;ter amounted to about a THOUSAND POUNDS per annum; be|&s;ides this, great &s;ums were collected at the &s;acraments and love-fea&s;ts, for quarterly tic|kets, private and publick &s;ub&s;criptions, &amp;c. &amp;c. The &s;ame kind of collections are made in all his Societies throughout the three king|doms, &s;o that Mr. We&s;ley might have ama&s;&s;ed an immen&s;e fortune, had riches been his ob|ject. But in&s;tead of accumulating wealth, he expended all his own private property: and I have been often informed, from good au|thority, that he never denied relief to a poor per&s;on that a&s;ked him. To needy trade&s;men I have known him to give ten or twenty pounds at once. In going a few yards from his &s;tudy to the pulpit, he generally gave away an handful of half-crowns to poor old people of his Society. He was indeed charitable to an
<PB N="191" REF="222">
extreme, as he often gave to unworthy objects, nor would he keep money &s;ufficient to hold out on his journies. One of his friends in|forms me that he left but &pound;4. 10s. 0. behind him: and I have heard him declare that he would not die worth twenty pounds, except his Books for &s;ale, &amp;c.</P>
<P>His learning and great abilities are well known. But I cannot help noticing that in one of his publications (&s;tepping out of his line) he betray'd extreme weakne&s;s and cre|dulity, though no doubt his intentions were good. What I allude to is his <HI>"Primitive Phy&s;ic;"</HI> a work certainly of a dangerous ten|dency, as the majority of remedies therein pre&s;cribed are mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly inefficacious, and many of them very dangerous, if admini&s;tred. The con&s;equence of the fir&s;t is, that while poor ignorant people are trying the&s;e remedies, (be&s;ides the very great probability of their mi&s;|taking the ca&s;e) the di&s;ea&s;es perhaps become &s;o inveterate as to re&s;i&s;t the power of more
<PB N="192" REF="223">
efficacious remedies properly applied, and with regard to tho&s;e of a highly dangerous nature, how ra&s;h to tru&s;t them in the hands of &s;uch uninformed people as this book was almo&s;t &s;olely intended for, e&s;pecially when &s;anctioned by the name of an author who&s;e influence impre&s;&s;ed the minds of the unfor|tunate patients with the mo&s;t powerful con|viction. Many fatal effects, I fear, have been produced by a blind adherence to this com|pilation; which carries with it more the ap|pearance of being the production of an ignorant opinionated old woman, than of the man of &s;cience and education. One melancholy in|&s;tance is fre&s;h in my memory; a much e&s;teem|ed friend having fallen an immediate &s;acrifice to an imprudent application of one of the&s;e remedies.</P>
<P>A very worthy Pyh&s;ician, to whom the Community are highly indebted for his inde|fatigable and &s;ucce&s;sful exertions in the cau&s;e of humanity, publi&s;hed &s;ome judicious re|marks
<PB N="193" REF="224">
on the <HI>"Primitive Phy&s;ic,"</HI> which however, for obvious &s;ea&s;ons, did not meet with that general attention the &s;ubject de|&s;erved; as almo&s;t all the admirers of Mr. We&s;ley's work con&s;i&s;ted of his followers, (&s;ufficiently numerous indeed to en&s;ure a very exten&s;ive &s;ale) the&s;e were too bigoted to con|de&s;cend to peru&s;e any production tending to enlighten their under&s;tandings; and the pub|lic at large, not having paid much attention to it; did not conceive them&s;elves &s;o materi|ally intere&s;ted in the Remarks.</P>
<P>Should you, my dear friend, be de&s;irous of peru&s;ing a variety of remedies, equally <HI>judici|ous</HI> as well as <HI>efficacious</HI> with tho&s;e of Mr. We&s;ley, you will meet with ample &s;atisfaction by turning to <HI>"Dom Pernetty's Voyage to the Falkland I&s;lands"</HI> page 153 to 162.</P>
<P>It was a circum&s;tance peculiarly happy for the practitioners of Phy&s;ic, though no doubt a terrible misfortune to the public, that the difference in religious principles of the&s;e two
<PB N="194" REF="225">

<P>ALTHOUGH Mr. We&s;ley was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a very great &s;hare both of natural and acquired abilities, yet I &s;uppo&s;e it &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to inform you, that this is by no means the ca&s;e with his preachers in general: For although there are among&s;t them &s;ome truly &s;en&s;ible, intelligent men, yet the major part are very ignorant and extremely illiterate: many of the&s;e excellent &s;piritual guides can|not even read a chapter in the Bible, though containing the deep my&s;teries which they have the ra&s;hne&s;s and pre&s;umption to pretend
<PB N="198" REF="229">
to explain. Many others cannot write then own names. But &s;o great is the ignorance of Mr. We&s;ley's people in general, that they often neglect the more rational and &s;en&s;ible of their preachers, and are better plea&s;ed with &s;uch as are even de&s;titute of common &s;en&s;e; really believing that the incoherent non&s;en&s;e which they from time to time pour forth, is dictated by the Holy Spirit; for which &s;everal rea&s;ons may be a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P>It is always ob&s;ervable, that the more igno|rant people are, the more confidence they po&s;|&s;e&s;s. This confidence, or <HI>impudence,</HI> pa&s;&s;es with the vulgar, as a mark of their being in the right; and the more the ignorance of the preachers is di&s;covered, the more are they brought down to their own &s;tandard. Again, the more ignorant preachers having very con|tracted ideas of real religion and manly vir|tue, of cour&s;e &s;upply the want of it with a ridiculous fu&s;s about trifles, which pa&s;&s;es with the ignorant for a more &s;anctified deportment,
<PB N="199" REF="230">
and hence ari&s;es much of the mi&s;chief which has been &s;o ju&s;tly charged on the Methodi&s;ts. For by making the path to Heaven &s;o very narrow, many de&s;pairing to be ever able to walk in it, have thrown off all religion and morality, and &s;unk into the aby&s;s of vice and wickedne&s;s. Others have their tempers &s;o &s;oured as to become lo&s;t to all the tender connexions of hu&s;band, wife, father, child, &amp;c. really believing that they are <HI>literally</HI> to <HI>hate</HI> father, mother, &amp;c. for Chri&s;t's &s;ake. Many have in a fit of de&s;pondency put a period to their exi&s;tence, it having become a burthen too intolerable to be borne. Some have been &s;o infatuated with the idea of fa&s;t|ing to mortify the fle&s;h, that their &s;trict per|&s;everance in it has been productive of the mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;equences: Two in&s;tances of which lately occurred in one family, in the City road&mdash;The Mi&s;tre&s;s was deprived of her &s;en&s;es, and the Maid <HI>literally</HI> fa&s;ted her&s;elf to death!</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="231">A few years &s;ince, I &s;aw in a field, not &s;even miles from town, a man to&s;&s;ing up his Bible in the air. This he often repeated, and raved at a &s;trange rate. Among&s;t other things, (pointing to a building at &s;ome di&s;tance) <Q>&startq;<HI>That</HI> (&s;aid he) is the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Hou&s;e, and it &endq;&s;hall not &s;tand three days longer!</Q> On the third day after this I &s;aw with &s;urprize an account in one of the public papers of that very building having been &s;et on fire, and burnt to the ground.</P>
<P>This maniac &s;oon after preached very often in Smithfield and Moorfields; but he did not wholly depend on the operations of the holy &s;pirit, as at la&s;t he &s;eldom began to preach until he was nearly drunk, or filled with another kind of &s;pirit, and then he was "a very powerful preacher indeed." But the good man happening &s;everal times to exert him&s;elf rather too much, had nearly tumbled headlong out of his portable pulpit, the&s;e ac|cidents the mob <HI>uncharitably</HI> a&s;cribed to the
<PB N="201" REF="232">
liquor that he had drank, and with mud, &s;tones, dead cats, &amp;c. drove him off every time he came, until at la&s;t our preacher took his leave of them with &s;aying "that he per|ceived it was in vain to attempt their conver|&s;ion, as he &s;aw that God had given them over to the hardne&s;s of their hearts."</P>
<P>But although this holy man de&s;erted them, yet other &s;piritual knights-errant were not wanting, &s;o that a little time before the heaps of &s;tones which lay for years in Moor|fields were removed for the purpo&s;e of build|ing on the &s;pot, I have &s;een five or &s;ix in a day preaching their initiation &s;ermons from tho&s;e elevated &s;ituations, until they could col|lect a &s;ufficient &s;um of money to purcha&s;e pulpits. Some of the&s;e excellent preachers re|ceived the whole of their divine education and took up their degrees in Moorfields, and in due time, after having given ample and &s;atisfactory proofs of being properly qualified, have been admitted to profe&s;&s;or&s;hips in the noble College

&s;ituated on the &s;outh &s;ide of tho&s;e fields, gene|rally known by the name of <HI>Bethlem.</HI> You mu&s;t know, &s;ir, that many of the lazy &s;ort of the community &s;et up &s;talls in Moorfields to buy and &s;ell apples, old iron, &amp;c. &s;everal of the&s;e having heard many &s;uch edifying di&s;|cour&s;es&punc; as they &s;at at their &s;talls, and ob&s;erv|ing the &s;ucce&s;s which tho&s;e kind of preach|ers met with, boldly re&s;olved to make trial of their &s;piritual gifts on the heaps of &s;tones, and have now totally abandoned their &s;talls, and are gone forth as emba&s;&s;adors of heaven, tho' without being furni&s;hed with any diplomas as &s;uch. One of the&s;e who cannot read, lately in|formed me that he had quitted all temporal concerns for the good of poor ignorant &s;inners. However after all, "there is (po&s;&s;ibly) a plea|&s;ure in being mad, which none but madmen know." The &s;ubject of methodi&s;m is &s;o fer|tile a one, that were I di&s;po&s;ed to enlarge thereon, my corre&s;pondence would be extend|ed to a very con&s;iderable length; but in&s;tead

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY new wife's attachment to books was a very fortunate circum&s;tance for us both, as it was not only a perpetual &s;ource of ratio|nal amu&s;ement, but al&s;o as it tended to pro|mote my trade; her extreme love for books made her delight to be in the &s;hop, where &s;he &s;oon became perfectly acquainted with every part of it, and (as my &s;tock increa&s;ed) with other rooms where I kept books; and could readily get any article that was a&s;ked for. So that when I was out on bu&s;ine&s;s, my &s;hop was well attended; this con&s;tant attention and good u&s;age procured me many cu&s;tomers, and I &s;oon perceived that I could &s;ell double and treble the
<PB N="205" REF="236">
quantity of books if I had a larger &s;tock. But how to enlarge it, I knew not, except by &s;low degrees, as my profits &s;hould enable me; for as I was almo&s;t a &s;tranger in London, I had but few acquaintances, and the&s;e few were not of the opulent &s;ort. I al&s;o &s;aw that the town abounded with cheats, &s;windlers, &amp;c. who under fal&s;e pretences obtained money and other property, of which the credulous were defrauded, which often prevented me from endeavouring to borrow, le&s;t I &s;hould be &s;u&s;|pected of having the &s;ame bad de&s;igns.</P>
<P>Soon after I commenced book&s;eller, I became acquainted with what Pope calls "the noble&s;t work of God," an HONEST man. This was Mr. JOHN DENIS, an oil-man in Cannon-&s;treet, (father of the pre&s;ent Mr. John Denis, Book|&s;eller.) This gentleman had often vi&s;ited me during my long illne&s;s, and having &s;een me tranquil and &s;erene when on the very point of death, he formed a favourable conclu&s;ion that I too mu&s;t be an hone&s;t man, as I had &s;o quiet
<PB N="206" REF="237">
a con&s;cience at &s;uch an awful period. Having retained the&s;e ideas of me after my recovery, and being perfectly well acquainted with my circum&s;tances, he one day offered to become a partner in my bu&s;ine&s;s, and to advance mo|ney in proportion to my &s;tock. This confi|dential offer I &s;oon accepted, early in 1778 he became partner, and we very &s;oon laid out his money in &s;econd hand books, which encrea&s;ed the &s;tock at once to double.</P>
<P>I &s;oon after this propo&s;ed printing a Sale Catalogue, to which, after making a few ob|jections, Mr. Denis con&s;ented. This Cata|logue of Twelve thou&s;and volumes (&s;uch as they were) was publi&s;hed in 1779. My partner's name was not in the title-page, the addre&s;s was only J. LACKINGTON &amp; Co. No. 46, Chi&s;well-&s;treet. This our fir&s;t pub|lication produced very oppo&s;ite effects on tho&s;e who peru&s;ed it; in &s;ome it excited much mirth, in others an equal proportion of anger. The major part of it was written by me, but
<PB N="207" REF="238">
Mr. Denis wrote many pages of it; and as his own private library con&s;i&s;ted of &s;carce old my&s;tical and alchymical books, printed above a century ago, many of them were in bad condition; this led him to in&s;ert <HI>neat</HI> in the Catalogue to many articles, which were only neat when compared with &s;uch as were in very bad condition; &s;o that when we produc|ed &s;uch books as were called <HI>neat</HI> in our Cata|logue, we often got our&s;elves laughed at, and &s;ometimes our <HI>neat</HI> articles were heartily damn'd. We had al&s;o a deal of trouble on another &s;core: Mr. Denis in&s;erted a number of articles without the author's names, and a&s;&s;ured me that the books were well known, and to mention the authors was often u&s;ele&s;s. The fact was, Mr. Denis knew who wrote tho&s;e articles; but was &s;oon convinced that many others did not, as we were often obliged to produce them merely to let our cu&s;tomers &s;ee who were the authors: we however took twenty pounds the fir&s;t week the books were on &s;ale,
<PB N="208" REF="239">
which we thought a large &s;um. The increa&s;e &s;tock augmented our cu&s;tomers in proportion, &s;o that Mr. Denis finding that his money turn'd to a better account in Book&s;elling than in the Funds, he very &s;oon lent the &s;tock near two hundred pounds, which I &s;till turned to a good account. We went on very friendly and pro&s;perou&s;ly for a little more than two years, when one night Mr. Denis hinted that he thought I was making purcha&s;es too fa&s;t, on which I grew warm, and reminded him of an article in our partner&s;hip agreement by which I was to be &s;ole purcha&s;er, and was at liberty to make what purcha&s;es I &s;hould judge proper. I al&s;o reminded him of the profits which my purcha&s;es produced, and he reminded me of his having more money in the trade than I had. We were indeed both very warm, and on my &s;aying, that if he was di&s;plea&s;ed with any part of my conduct, he was at liberty to quit the partner&s;hip, he in great warmth replied that he would. The above
<PB N="209" REF="240">
pa&s;&s;ed at Mr. Denis's hou&s;e in Hoxton-&s;quare, I then bade him good night; when Mr. De|nis called at the &s;hop the next day, he a&s;ked me if I continued in the &s;ame mind I was in the preceding night? I a&s;&s;ured him that I did. He then demanded of me whether I in|&s;i&s;ted on his keeping his word to quit the partner&s;hip? I replied, I did not <HI>in&s;i&s;t</HI> on it, as I had taken him a partner for three years, nearly one third part of which time was un|expired; but, I added, that, as I had always found him &s;trictly a man of his word, I &s;up|po&s;ed he would prove him&s;elf &s;o in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, and not a&s;&s;ert one thing at night and another in the morning. On which he ob|&s;erved that as he was not provided with a &s;hop, he mu&s;t take &s;ome time to look for one. I told him that he might take as long a time as he thought nece&s;&s;ary. This was in March 1780. He appointed the twentieth of May, following. On that day we accordingly di&s;|&s;olved the partner&s;hip, and as he had more
<PB N="210" REF="241">
money in the trade than my&s;elf, he took my notes for what I was deficient. We parted it great friend&s;hip, which continued to the day of his death; he generally called every morning to &s;ee us, and learn our concerns, and we con|&s;tantly informed him of all that had pa&s;&s;ed the preceding day; as how much ca&s;h we had taken, what were the profits, what purcha&s;es we had made, what bills we had to pay, &amp;c. and he &s;ometimes lent me money to help to pay them.</P>
<P>At his death he left behind him in his pri|vate library the be&s;t collection of &s;carce valua|ble, my&s;tical, and alchymical books that ever was collected by one per&s;on. In his lifetime he prized the&s;e kind of books above every thing; in collecting them he never cared what price he paid for them. This led him to think, after he became a book&s;eller, that other book-collectors &s;hould pay their money as freely as he had done his, which was often a &s;ubject of debate between him and me, as
<PB N="211" REF="242">
I was for &s;elling every thing cheap, in order to keep and increa&s;e our cu&s;tomers.</P>
<P>Mr. Denis was, at the time of his death, about fifty years of age. He informed me that in his childhood and youth he was weakly to an extreme, &s;o that no one who knew him ever thought he could live to be twenty; however he enjoy'd an uninterrupted &s;tate of health for nearly the la&s;t thirty years of his life; this he a&s;cribed to his &s;trictly adhering to the rules laid down by <HI>Cornaro</HI> and <HI>Tryon</HI> in their books on Health, Long Life, and Happine&s;s. His unexpected death was in con&s;equence of a fever caught by &s;itting in a cold damp room.</P>

<P>IT was &s;ometime in the year &s;eventeen hun|dred and eighty, that I re&s;olved from that period to give no per&s;on whatever any credit. I was induced to make this re&s;olution from various motives: I ob&s;erved that where credit was given, mo&s;t bills were not paid within &s;ix months, many not within a twelvemonth, and &s;ome not within two years. Indeed many trade&s;men have accounts of &s;even years
<PB N="213" REF="244">
&s;tanding; and &s;ome bills are never paid. The lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained by the intere&s;t of money in long credits, and by tho&s;e bills that were not paid at all; the inconveniences attending not hav|ing the ready-money to lay out in trade to the be&s;t advantage; together with the great lo&s;s of time in keeping accounts, and collecting debts, convinced me, that if I could but e&s;tab|li&s;h a ready-money bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>without any ex|ceptions,</HI> I &s;hould be enabled to &s;ell every arti|cle very cheap. When I communicated my ideas on this &s;ubject to &s;ome of my acquaint|ances, I was much laughed at and ridiculed; and it was thought, that I might as well attempt to rebuild the tower of Babel, as to e&s;tabli&s;h a large bu&s;ine&s;s without giving credit. But notwith&s;tanding this di&s;couragement, and even <HI>You,</HI> my dear friend, expre&s;&s;ing your doubts of the practicability of my &s;cheme, I re&s;olved to make the experiment; and I began it by marking in every book the lowe&s;t price that I would take for it; which being much
<PB N="214" REF="245">
lower than the common market prices, I no$ only retained my former cu&s;tomers, but &s;oo$ increa&s;ed their numbers. But, my dear &s;ir you can &s;carce imagine what difficulties I en|countered for &s;everal years together. I even &s;ometimes thought of relinqui&s;hing this my favourite &s;cheme altogether, as by it I was obliged to deny credit to my very acquaintance; I was al&s;o obliged to refu&s;e it to the mo&s;t re&s;pectable characters, as <HI>no exception</HI> was, or now is made, not even in favour of Nobility; my porters being &s;trictly enjoined, by one general order, to bring back all books not previou&s;ly paid for, excepting they receive the amount on delivery. Again many in the country found it difficult to remit &s;mall &s;ums that are below Bankers notes, and others to whom I was a &s;tranger, did not like to &s;end the money fir&s;t, as not knowing how I &s;hould treat them, and &s;u&s;pecting by the price of the articles, there mu&s;t certainly be &s;ome deception. Many unacquainted with my plan
<PB N="215" REF="246">
of bu&s;ine&s;s, were much offended, until the advantages accruing to them from it were duly explained, when they very readily ac|ceded to it. As to the anger of &s;uch, who though they were acquainted with it, were &s;till determined to deal on credit only, I con|&s;idered that as of little con&s;equence, from an opinion that &s;ome of them would have been as much enraged when their bills were &s;ent in, had credit been given them.</P>
<P>I had al&s;o difficulties of another nature to en|counter; when fir&s;t I began to &s;ell very cheap, many came to my &s;hop prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed again&s;t my goods, and of cour&s;e often &s;aw faults where none exi&s;ted, &s;o that the be&s;t editions were merely from prejudice deemed very bad editions, and the be&s;t bindings &s;aid to be infe|rior workman&s;hip, for no other rea&s;on, but becau&s;e I &s;old them &s;o cheap; and I often re|ceived letters from the country, to know if &s;uch and &s;uch articles were <HI>really</HI> as I &s;tated them in my catalogues, and <HI>if they</HI> REALLY
<PB N="216" REF="247">
<HI>were the be&s;t editions, if</HI> REALLY <HI>in calf; and</HI> REALLY <HI>elegantly bound</HI>; and many other <HI>reallys.</HI> Oh my friend! I <HI>really</HI> was afraid for &s;ome years that I &s;hould be <HI>really</HI> mad with vexation. But the&s;e letters of <HI>reallys</HI> have for years happily cea&s;ed, and the public are now <HI>really</HI> and thoroughly convinced that I will not a&s;&s;ert in my catalogues what is not <HI>really</HI> true. But imagine, if you can, what I mu&s;t have felt, on hearing the very be&s;t of goods depreciated, on no other account whatever, but becau&s;e they were not charged at a higher price.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o worth ob&s;erving, that there were not wanting among the book&s;ellers, &s;ome who were mean enough to a&s;&s;ert that all my books were bound in &s;heep; and many other unmanly artifices were practi&s;ed, all of which &s;o far from injuring me, as ba&s;ely intended, turned to my account; for when gentlemen were brought to my &s;hop by their friends, to purcha&s;e &s;ome trifling article, or were led
<PB N="217" REF="248">
into it by curio&s;ity, they were often very much &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee many thou&s;and volumes in ele|gant and &s;uperb bindings. The natural con|clu&s;ion was, that if I had not held forth to the Public better terms than others, I &s;hould not have been &s;o much envied.

<P>IN the fir&s;t three years after I refu&s;ed to give credit to any per&s;on, my bu&s;ine&s;s increa&s;ed much, and as the whole of my profit (after paying all expences) was laid out in books, my &s;tock was continually enlarged, &s;o that my Catalogues in the year Seventeen hundred and eighty-four, were very much augmented in &s;ize. The fir&s;t contained Twelve thou&s;and, and the &s;econd thirty thou&s;and volumes: this increa&s;e was not merely in numbers, but al&s;o in value, as a very great part of the&s;e volumes were <HI>better,</HI> that is, books of an higher price. But notwith&s;tanding the great increa&s;e of my bu&s;ine&s;s, I &s;till met with many difficulties on
<PB N="219" REF="250">
account of my &s;elling books cheap; one of the&s;e I confe&s;s I did not fore&s;ee: as the more con|vinced the public were of my acting &s;trictly conformable to the plan I had adopted, the more this objection gained ground, and even to the pre&s;ent day is not <HI>entirely</HI> done away. This diffi|culty was, In making private purcha&s;es of libra|ries and parcels of books, many of my cu&s;tomers for &s;everal years had no objection to <HI>buying</HI> of me becau&s;e I &s;old cheap, but were not equally inclined to <HI>&s;ell</HI> me &s;uch books as they had no u&s;e for, or libraries that were left them at the death of relations, &amp;c. They rea&s;oned (very plau&s;ibly, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed) thus: <Q>&startq;Lack|ington &s;ells very cheap; he therefore will not give much for what is offered him for &s;ale. I will go to tho&s;e who &s;ell very dear; as the more they &s;ell their books for, the &endq;more they can afford to give for them.</Q></P>
<P>This mode of rea&s;oning, however &s;pecious it &s;eems at fir&s;t, will on due reflection appear nugatory and erroneous, for the following rea|&s;ons;</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="251">I believe no one ever knew or heard of a covetous man that would &s;ell his goods <HI>cheap:</HI> But every one has heard of &s;uch characters &s;elling <HI>very dear</HI>; and when a covetous per|&s;on makes a purcha&s;e, is it likely that he &s;hould offer a generous price? Does he not when buying po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame avaritious tem|per as when &s;elling? And on the other hand, I cannot help thinking (I am aware of the inference) that one who has been con|&s;tantly &s;elling cheap for a &s;eries of years mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome degree of genero&s;ity; and that this di&s;po&s;ition has prevailed in me when I have been called to purcha&s;e libraries or par|cels of books, thou&s;ands in the three king|doms can witne&s;s. And however paradoxical it may appear, I will add, that I can afford to give more for books now, than I could if I &s;old them much dearer. For, were I to &s;ell them dear, I &s;hould be ten times longer in &s;elling them; and the warehou&s;e-room, in|&s;urance from fire, and the intere&s;t of the
<PB N="221" REF="252">
money lying long in a dead &s;tock, would pre|vent my giving a large price when books were offered for &s;ale.</P>
<P>But it did not appear in this point of view to the public in the more early &s;tages of my bu&s;ine&s;s, until being often &s;ent for after other book&s;ellers had made offers for libraries, and finding that I would give more than they had offered, it was communicated from one to ano|ther until it became publickly known; and the following method which I adopted &s;ome years &s;ince has put the matter beyond the &s;hadow of a doubt.</P>
<P>When I am called upon to purcha&s;e any libra|ry or parcel of books, either my&s;elf or my a&s;|&s;i&s;tants carefully examine them, and if de&s;ired to fix a price, I mention at a word the utmo&s;t that I will give for them, which I always take care &s;hall be as much as any book&s;eller can afford to give: but if the &s;eller entertains any doubt re&s;pecting the price offered, and choo&s;es to try other book&s;ellers, he pays me
<PB N="222" REF="253">
five per cent. for valuing the books; and as he knows what I have valued them at, he tries among the trade, and when he finds that he cannot get any greater &s;um offered, on re|turning to me, he not only receives the price I at fir&s;t offered, but al&s;o a return of the five per cent. which was paid me for the valua|tion.</P>
<P>But to &s;uch as fix a price on their own books I make no charge.</P>
<P>This equitable mode I have the plea&s;ure to find has given the public the utmo&s;t &s;atis|faction.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I was fir&s;t initiated into the vari|ous manoeuvres practi&s;ed by book&s;ellers, I found it cu&s;tomary among them, (which practice &s;till continues) that when any books had not gone off &s;o rapidly as expected, or &s;o fa&s;t as to pay for keeping them in &s;tore, they would put what remained of &s;uch articles into private &s;ales, where only book&s;ellers are ad|mitted, and of them only &s;uch as were in|vited by having a catalogue &s;ent them. At one of the&s;e &s;ales I have frequently &s;een Seventy or eighty thou&s;and volumes &s;old after dinner, including books of every de&s;cription,
<PB N="224" REF="255">
bad and indifferent; by this means they were di&s;tributed through the trade.</P>
<P>When fir&s;t invited to the&s;e Trade-&s;ales, I was very much &s;urpri&s;ed to learn, that it was common for &s;uch as purcha&s;ed remainders, to de&s;troy one half or three fourths of &s;uch books, and to charge the full publication price, or nearly that, for &s;uch as they kept on hand; for a &s;hort time I cautiou&s;ly complied with this cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>But I &s;oon began to reflect that many of the&s;e books &s;o de&s;troyed, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed much me|rit, and only wanted to be better known; and that if others were not worth &s;ix &s;hillings, they were worth three or two, and &s;o in proportion for high$r or lower priced books.</P>
<P>From that time I re&s;olved not to de&s;troy any books that were worth &s;aving, but to &s;ell them off at half, or a quarter of the publi|cation prices. By &s;elling them in this cheap manner, I have di&s;po&s;ed of many hundred thou&s;and volumes, many thou&s;ands of which
<PB N="225" REF="256">
have been intrin&s;ically worth their original prices. This part of my conduct, however, though evidently highly beneficial to the com|munity, created me many enemies among the trade; &s;ome of the meaner part of whom, in|&s;tead of attending to the increa&s;e of their own bu&s;ine&s;s, aimed at reducing mine; and by a variety of pitiful in&s;inuations and dark inu|endoes, &s;training every nerve to injure the reputation I had already acquired with the Public, determined, (as they <HI>wi&s;ely</HI> conclud|ed) thus to effect my ruin; which indeed they daily progno&s;ticated, with a demon-like &s;pirit, mu&s;t inevitably very &s;peedily follow. This conduct, however, was far from inti|midating me, as the effect proved directly op|po&s;ite to what they expected, and I found the re&s;pect and confidence of the Public con|tinually increa&s;ing, which added very con&s;i|derably to the number of my cu&s;tomers: It being an unque&s;tionable fact, that before I adopted this plan, great numbers of per&s;ons
<PB N="226" REF="257">
were very de&s;irous of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;ome particu|lar books, for which however (from various motives) they were not inclined to pay the original price; as &s;ome availed them&s;elves of the opportunity of borrowing from a friend, or from a circulating library, or having once read them, though they held the works in e&s;teem, might deem them too dear to purcha&s;e, or they might have a copy by them, which from their own and family's frequent u&s;e, (or lending to friends) might not be in &s;o good a condition as they could wi&s;h, though rather than purcha&s;e them again at the full price, they would keep tho&s;e they had; or again, they might be de&s;irous to purcha&s;e them to make pre&s;ents of; or they might have a com|mi&s;&s;ion from a corre&s;pondent in the country, or abroad, and wi&s;h to gain a &s;mall profit on the articles for their trouble.</P>
<P>Thou&s;ands of others have been effectually prevented from purcha&s;ing, (though anxious &s;o to do) who&s;e circum&s;tances in life would
<PB N="227" REF="258">
not permit them to pay the full price, and thus were totally excluded from the advantage of improving their under&s;tandings, and en|joying a rational entertainment. And you may be a&s;&s;ured, that it affords me the mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;atisfaction, independent of the emo|luments which have accrued to me from this plan, when I reflect what prodigious numbers in inferior or <HI>reduced</HI> &s;ituations of life, have been e&s;&s;entially benefited in con&s;equence of being thus enabled to indulge their natural propen&s;ity for the acqui&s;ition of knowledge, on ea&s;y terms: nay I could almo&s;t be vain enough to a&s;&s;ert, that I have thereby been highly in|&s;trumental in diffu&s;ing that general de&s;ire for READING, now &s;o prevalent among the inferior orders of &s;ociety; which mo&s;t certainly, if it does not prove equally in&s;tructive to all, keeps them from employing their time and money, if not to <HI>bad,</HI> at lea&s;t to <HI>le&s;s rational</HI> purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>How happy &s;hould I have deemed my&s;elf in the earlier &s;tage of my life, if I could have
<PB N="228" REF="259">
met with the opportunity which every on$ capable of reading may now enjoy, of obtain+ing books at &s;o ea&s;y a rate! Had that been the ca&s;e, the Catalogue of my <HI>juvenile Library</HI> with which I pre&s;ented you in a former letter would have made a more re&s;pectable appear|ance, and I might po&s;&s;ibly have been enabled when I purcha&s;ed Young's Night Thoughts for a <HI>Chri&s;tmas dinner,</HI> to have at the &s;ame time bought a joint of meat, and thus enjoyed both a mental and corporeal fea&s;t, as well as plea&s;ed my wife, (which I need not inform you the ladies &s;ay every good hu&s;band ought to do.) But after all, quere, Whether if I had enjoyed &s;uch an advantage, &s;hould I ever have thought of commencing book&s;eller?

<P>ALTHOUGH the re&s;ult of the plan which I adopted for reducing the price of books, as mentioned in my la&s;t, was a va&s;t increa&s;e of purcha&s;ers, yet at the &s;ame time I found a prodigious accumulation of my expences;
<PB N="230" REF="261">
which will not appear &s;trange, when I inform you that I made proportionably large pur|cha&s;es, &s;uch as two hundred copies of one book, three hundred of another, five hun|dred of a third, a thou&s;and of a fourth, two thou&s;and of a fifth, nay &s;ometimes I have purcha&s;ed &s;ix thou&s;and copies of one book, and at one time I had no le&s;s than TEN THOU|SAND COPIES of Watts's P&s;alms, and the &s;ame number of his Hymns in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. In ad|dition to the&s;e, I purcha&s;ed very large numbers of many thou&s;and different articles, at trade|&s;ales of all &s;orts, as bankrupt &s;ales, &s;ales of &s;uch as had retired from bu&s;ine&s;s, others cau&s;ed by deaths of book&s;ellers, &s;ales to reduce large &s;tocks, annual &s;ales, &amp;c. &amp;c. not to reckon tho&s;e purcha&s;ed of authors and town and coun-book&s;ellers, by private contract, &amp;c. to a very con&s;iderable amount. My expences were al&s;o ex|ceedingly increa&s;ed by the nece&s;&s;ity I was under of keeping each article in a variety of different kinds of bindings, to &s;uit the various ta&s;tes of
<PB N="231" REF="262">
my cu&s;tomers: Be&s;ides paying my bills for the above, I was always obliged to find ready mo|ney to pay for libraries and parcels of &s;econd|hand books, which after a while poured in upon me from town and country. So that I often look back with a&s;toni&s;hment at my courage (or temerity, if you plea&s;e) in pur|cha&s;ing, and my wonderful &s;ucce&s;s in taking money &s;ufficient to pay the exten&s;ive de|mands that were perpetually made upon me, as there is not another in&s;tance of &s;ucce&s;s &s;o rapid and con&s;tant under &s;uch circum&s;tances. Some indeed there have been, who for two or three years, purcha&s;ed away very fa&s;t, but could not per&s;evere, as they were unable to &s;ell with equal rapidity: for no one that has not a quick &s;ale can po&s;&s;ibly &s;ucceed with large numbers. For &s;uppo&s;ing that a book|&s;eller expends a thou&s;and pounds in the pur|cha&s;e of four articles (I have often done that in one article) and the&s;e are bought at a quar|ter the u&s;ual price, the intere&s;t of the money is fifty pounds a year; be&s;ides which &s;ome al|lowance
<PB N="232" REF="263">
mu&s;t be made for warehou&s;e-room, in&s;urance from fire, &amp;c. &s;o that granting he might &s;ell a few of each article every year at four times the pricehe fir&s;t gave for them, yet if he does not &s;ell enough to pay the intere&s;t and other expences of tho&s;e that remain, he is, after all, on the lo&s;ing &s;ide; which has been the ca&s;e with the major part of &s;uch as have purcha&s;ed a large number of one book.</P>
<P>For &s;everal years together I thought I &s;hould be obliged to de&s;i&s;t from purcha&s;ing a large number of any one article; for although by not giving any credit I was enabled to &s;ell very cheap, yet the heavy &s;tock of books in &s;heets often di&s;heartened me, &s;o that I more than once re&s;olved to leave off purcha&s;ing all &s;uch articles where the number was very large. But, &s;omehow or other, a torrent of bu&s;ine&s;s &s;uddenly poured in upon me on all &s;ides, &s;o that I very &s;oon forgot my re&s;olution of not making large purcha&s;es, and now find my ac|count in firmly adhering to that method; and
<PB N="233" REF="264">
being univer&s;ally known for making large purcha&s;es, mo&s;t of the Trade in town and country, and al&s;o authors of every de&s;cription are continually furni&s;hing me with opportuni|ties. In this branch of trade it is next to im|po&s;&s;ible for me ever to have any formidable rivals, as it requires an uncommon exertion, as well as very uncommon &s;ucce&s;s, and that for many years together, to ri&s;e to any great degree of eminence in that particular line. This &s;ucce&s;s mu&s;t be attained too, without the aid of <HI>novelty,</HI> which I found to be of very great &s;ervice to me: And &s;hould any per&s;on begin on my plan and &s;ucceed extremely well, he could never &s;uper&s;ede me, as I am &s;till enlarging my bu&s;ine&s;s every year, and the more it is ex|tended the cheaper I can afford to &s;ell; &s;o that though I may be pur&s;ued, I cannot be overtak|en, except I &s;hould (as &s;ome others have done) be &s;o infatuated and blinded by pro&s;perity, as to think that the Public would continue their favors, even though the plan of bu&s;ine&s;s were
<PB N="234" REF="265">
rever&s;ed. But as the fir&s;t king of Bohemia kept his country &s;hoes by him, to remind him from whence he was taken, I have put a mot|to on the doors of my carriage, con&s;tantly to remind me to what I am indebted for my pro&s;perity, viz.

<P>IT has been a&s;ked, times innumerable, how I acquired a tolerable degree of knowledge, &s;o as to enable me to form any ideas of the merits or demerits of books; or how I became &s;uffi|ciently acquainted with the prices that books were commonly &s;old for, &s;o as to be able to buy
<PB N="236" REF="267">
and &s;ell; particularly books in the learned and foreign languages. Many have thought that from the beginning I always kept &s;hop|men to furni&s;h me with in&s;tructions nece&s;&s;ary to carry on my bu&s;ine&s;s; but you and all my old friends and acquaintances well know that not to have been the ca&s;e; as for the fir&s;t thir|teen years after I became a book&s;eller, I never had one &s;hopman that knew any thing of the worth of books, or how to write a &s;ingle page of a catalogue properly, much le&s;s to compile the whole. I always wrote them my&s;elf, &s;o long as my health would permit: Indeed I con|tinued the practice for years after my health was much impaired by too con&s;tant an appli|cation to that and reading; and when I was at la&s;t obliged to give up writing them, I for &s;eve|ral catalogues &s;tood by and dictated to others; even to the pre&s;ent time I take &s;ome little part in their compilation; and as I ever did, I &s;till continue to fix the price to every book, except I am out of town. I have now many a&s;&s;i&s;tants
<PB N="237" REF="268">
in my &s;hop, who can compile catalogues, buy, &s;ell, and in &s;hort tran&s;act the major part of my bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>As to the little knowledge of literature I po&s;&s;e&s;s, I acquired that by dint of application. In the beginning I attached my&s;elf very clo&s;e|ly to the &s;tudy of divinity and moral philo&s;o|phy; &s;o that I became tolerably acquainted with all the points controverted between the Divines; after having read the great cham|pions for Chri&s;tianity, I next read the works of Lord Herbert, Tindal, Chubb, Morgan, Collins, Wool&s;ton, Annet, Mandeville, Shafte&s;bury, Bolingbroke, Williams, Voltaire, and many other Free-thinkers. I have al&s;o read mo&s;t of our Engli&s;h poets, and the be&s;t tran&s;lations of the Greek, Latin, Italian and French poets; nor did I omit Hi&s;tory, Voyages, Travels, Natural Hi&s;tory, Biography, &amp;c. At one time it was my intention to learn French, but as &s;oon as I was enabled to make out and abridge title-pages, &s;o as to in&s;ert them right
<PB N="238" REF="269">
in my catalogues, I left off for what appeared to me more plea&s;ing as well as more nece&s;&s;ary pur&s;uits; con&s;idering that as I began &s;o late in life, and had probably but a very &s;hort period to live, I had no time to be&s;tow on the attainment of languages. I therefore content|ed my&s;elf with reading all the tran&s;lations of the cla&s;&s;ics, and in&s;erting the originals in my Catalogues as well as I could; and when &s;ometimes I happened to put the <HI>Genitive</HI> or <HI>Dative</HI> ca&s;e in&s;tead of the <HI>Nominative</HI> or <HI>Accu&s;ative,</HI> my cu&s;tomers kindly con&s;idered this as a venial fault, which they readily pardoned, and bought the books notwith|&s;tanding.</P>
<P>As I have indefatigably u&s;ed my be&s;t en|deavours to acquire knowledge, I never thought I had the &s;malle&s;t rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed on ac|count of any deficiency, e&s;pecially as I never made preten&s;ions to great erudition, or affect|ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s what I knew I was deficient Dr. Young's couplet, you will therefore think

<P><Q>&startq;On Sunday, May 24, 1789, died at his hou&s;e in Wor&s;hip-&s;treet, Moorfields, aged 50. Mr. Ralph Tinley; one who had not dignity of birth or elevated rank in life to boa&s;t of, but who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed what is far &s;u|perior to either, a &s;olid under&s;tanding, miable manners, a due &s;en&s;e of religion, and an indu&s;trious di&s;po&s;ition. In&s;tead of riches, Providence ble&s;&s;ed him with a good &s;hare of health, and a mind contented with an humble &s;ituation. Tho&s;e hours which he could &s;pare from a proper attention to the duties of a hu&s;band and a father, and
<PB N="242" REF="273">
manual labour as a &s;hoemaker, were ince&s;|&s;antly employed in the improvement of his mind in various branches of &s;cience; in many of which he attained a proficiency, totally dive&s;ted of that affectation of &s;uperi|ority which little minds a&s;&s;ume. The&s;e qualities rendered him re&s;pected by all who knew him, as an intelligent man, and a mo&s;t agreeable companion. Among other acqui&s;itions, ENTOMOLOGY was his pecu|liar delight. Thus far the pro&s;pect is plea&s;|ing. It is a painful ta&s;k to add, that this amiable per&s;on fell a victim to an unhappy error in taking a medicine. The evening previous to his decea&s;e he &s;pent in a philo&s;o|phical Society, of which he had many years been a member, and where his attendance had been con&s;tant; but finding him&s;elf in|di&s;po&s;ed, he in the morning early had re|cour&s;e to a phial of antimonial wine, which had long been in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and of which only a &s;mall part remained. This,
<PB N="243" REF="274">
mo&s;t unfortunately! he &s;wallowed; and it having by long maceration, acquired an extraordinary degree of &s;trength, and being rendered turbid by mixing with the metal|lic particles, it produced the effect of a violent poi&s;on, occa&s;ioning almo&s;t in&s;tan|taneous death. May his fate prove a warn|ing to others to be careful how they ven|ture to confide in their own judgement in &s;o intricate a &s;cience as medicine!&mdash;His va|luable cabinet of in&s;ects, both foreign and dome&s;tic, &s;uppo&s;ed to be one of the com|plete&s;t (of a private collection) in the king|dom, all &s;cientifically arranged with pecu|liar neatne&s;s, and in the fine&s;t pre&s;ervation, will (if it falls into proper hands,) remain a monument of his knowledge and ap|plication.&endq;</Q> &mdash; But to proceed.</P>
<P>I cannot help regretting the di&s;advantages I labor under by having been deprived of the benefits of an early education, as it is a lo&s;s can &s;carcely be repaired, in any &s;ituation. How
<PB N="244" REF="275">
much more difficult then was it for me to attain any degree of proficiency, when in|volved in the concerns of a large bu&s;ine&s;s?

The in&s;tructions that I received from men and books were often like the &s;eeds &s;own among thorns, the cares of the world choked them So that although I under&s;tand a little of many branches of literature, yet my knowledge is, af|ter all, I freely confe&s;s, but &s;uperficial; which indeed I need not have told you. However, &s;uperficial as it is, it not only affords me an endle&s;s &s;ource of plea&s;ure, but it has been of very great u&s;e to me in bu&s;ine&s;s, as it enabled me to put a value on thou&s;ands of articles, before I knew what &s;uch books were com|monly &s;old at: 'tis true I was &s;ometime$ mi&s;taken, and have &s;old a very great number of different articles much lower than I ought even on my own plan of &s;elling very cheap
<PB N="245" REF="276">
yet that gave me no concern; But if I found out that I had (as &s;ometimes was the ca&s;e) &s;old any articles too dear, it gave me much unea&s;ine&s;s; for whether I had any other motives I will leave to &s;uch as are ac|quainted with me to determine, but I rea&s;on|ed thus; If I fell a book too dear, I perhaps lo&s;e that cu&s;tomer and his friends for ever, but if I &s;ell articles con&s;iderably under their real value, the purcha&s;er will come again and recommend my &s;hop to his acquaintances, &s;o that from the principles of &s;elf-intere&s;t I would &s;ell cheap; I always was inclined to rea&s;on in this manner, and nine years &s;ince a very tri|fling circum&s;tance operated much upon my mind and fully convinced me my judgment was right on that head. Mrs. Lackington had bought a piece of linen to make me &s;ome &s;hirts; when the linen-draper's man brought it into my &s;hop, three ladies were pre&s;ent, and on &s;eeing the cloth opened, a&s;ked Mrs. L. what it co&s;t per yard: on being told the price, they
<PB N="246" REF="277">
all &s;aid it was very cheap, and each lady went and purcha&s;ed the &s;ame quantity, to make &s;hirts for their hu&s;bands, tho&s;e pieces were again di&s;play'd to their acquaintances, &s;o that the linen-draper got a deal of cu&s;tom from that very circum&s;tance; and I re&s;olved to do likewi&s;e. However trifling this anecdote may appear, you will pardon me for introducing it, when you reflect that it was productive of very beneficial con&s;equences, and that many great effects have ari&s;en from as trivial cau&s;es.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT has been long &s;ince remarked, that a per|&s;on may be well acquainted with books, or in other words, may be a very learned man, and yet remain almo&s;t totally ignorant of men and manners. Hence many fine chimerical &s;y&s;tems of Law, Government, &amp;c. have been &s;pun out of the prolific brains of the learned, which have only &s;erved to amu&s;e others as learned and as unacquainted with mankind as
<PB N="248" REF="279">
the authors, and have frequently produced a number of Replies, Ob&s;ervations, &s;evere, (not to &s;ay &s;currilous) Critici&s;ms, and new Sy&s;|tems and Hypothe&s;es; the&s;e again gave birth to fre&s;h Remarks, &amp;c. <HI>ad&mdash;&mdash; (infinitum,</HI> I was going to &s;ay&mdash;but I beg pardon, having promi&s;ed to give you no more Latin.) The&s;e learned men, after tiring them&s;elves and the Public, have too often left them ju&s;t as wi&s;e on the &s;ubject as when they began. The reading and &s;tudying of Hi&s;tory, Voyages, Travels, &amp;c. will no doubt contribute much to that kind of knowledge, but will not alone be &s;ufficient. In order to become a proficient in that u&s;eful branch of knowledge, "MAN, KNOW THYSELF!" was a precept of the an|tient philo&s;ophers. But I can &s;carce think it po&s;&s;ible for any man to be well acquainted with him&s;elf, without his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a tole|rable degree of knowledge of the re&s;t of mankind. In the former part of my life I &s;aw a deal of what is called <HI>low life,</HI> and be|came
<PB N="249" REF="280">
came acquainted with the cu&s;toms, manners, di&s;po&s;itions, prejudices, &amp;c. of the labouring part of the community, in various cities, towns and villages; for years pa&s;t, I have &s;pent &s;ome of my lei&s;ure hours among that cla&s;s of people who are called opulent or genteel trade&s;men; nor have I been totally excluded from higher circles; but among all the &s;chools where the knowledge of mankind is to be ac|quired, I know of none equal to that of a <HI>bookseller's &s;hop,</HI> e&s;pecially if the ma&s;ter is of an inqui&s;itive and communicative turn, and is in a con&s;iderable line of bu&s;ine&s;s: His &s;hop will then be a place of re&s;ort for men, wo|men, and children, of various nations, and of as various capacities, di&s;po&s;itions, &amp;c.</P>

<P>But it would be an endle&s;s talk to &s;et down the various and oppo&s;ite articles that are con|&s;tantly called for in my &s;hop. To talk to the&s;e different pur&s;uers after happine&s;s, or amu&s;e|ment, has given me much plea&s;ure, and afforded me &s;ome knowledge of mankind, and al&s;o of Books: and to hear the debates that frequently occur between the different purcha&s;ers is a fine amu&s;ement; &s;o that I have &s;ometimes compared my &s;hop to a &s;tage. And I a&s;&s;ure you that a variety of characters, &s;trong|ly mark'd con&s;tantly make their appearance.</P>
<P>Would my health permit my con&s;tant at|tendance, I &s;hould prefer it, to every thing in life, and you may recollect that for &s;ome years I &s;ought no other amu&s;ement whatever.</P>
<P>Having been long habituated to make re|marks on whatever I &s;aw or heard, is another rea&s;on why I have &s;ucceeded &s;o well in my
<PB N="253" REF="284">
bu&s;ine&s;s. I have for the la&s;t &s;even years &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively told my acquaintances before the year began, how much money I &s;hould take in the cour&s;e of it, without once failing of tak|ing the &s;um mentioned. I formed my judg|ment by ob&s;erving what kind of &s;tock in trade I had in hand, and by con&s;idering how that &s;tock was adapted to the different ta&s;tes and pur&s;uits of the times; in doing this I was obliged to be pretty well informed of the &s;tate of politics in Europe, as I have always found that <HI>Book-&s;elling</HI> is much affected by the political &s;tate of affairs. For as mankind are in &s;earch of amu&s;ement, they often take the fir&s;t that of|fers; &s;o that if there is any thing is the news-papers of con&s;equence, that draws many to the coffee-hou&s;e, where they chat away the evenings, in&s;tead of vi&s;iting the &s;hops of Book&s;ellers (<HI>as they ought to do, no doubt</HI>) or <HI>reading</HI> at home. The be&s;t time for Book-&s;elling, is when there is no kind of news &s;tir|ring; then many of tho&s;e who for months
<PB N="254" REF="285">
would have done nothing but talk of war or peace, revolutions, and counter-revolutions, &amp;c. &amp;c. for want of other amu&s;ement will have recour&s;e to Books; &s;o that I have often experienced that the report of a war, or the tryal of a great man, or indeed any &s;ubject that attracts the public attention, has been &s;ome hundreds of pounds out of my pocket in a few weeks.</P>
<P>Before I conclude th$s letter, I cannot help ob&s;erving, that the &s;ale of books in general has increa&s;ed prodigiou&s;ly within the la&s;t twenty years. According to the be&s;t e&s;timation I have been able to make, I &s;uppo&s;e that more than four times the number of books are &s;old now than were &s;old twenty years &s;ince. The poorer &s;ort of farmers, and even the poor coun|try people in general, who before that period &s;pent their winter evenings in relating &s;tories of witches, gho&s;ts, hobgoblins, &amp;c. now &s;horten the nights by hearing their &s;ons and daughters read tales, romances, &amp;c. and on

entering their hou&s;es, you may &s;ee Tom Jones, Roderick Random, and other entertaining books &s;tuck up on their bacon racks, &amp;c. and if <HI>John</HI> goes to town with a load of hay, he is charged to be &s;ure not to forget to bring home "Peregrine Pickle's adventures;" and when <HI>Dolly</HI> is &s;ent to market to &s;ell her eggs &s;he is commi&s;&s;ioned to purcha&s;e "The hi&s;tory of Pamela Andrews." In &s;hort all ranks and degrees now READ. But the mo&s;t rapid in|crea&s;e of the &s;ale of books has been &s;ince the termination of the late war.</P>
<P>A number of book-clubs are al&s;o formed in every part of England, where each member &s;ub&s;cribes a certain &s;um quarterly to purcha&s;e Books; in &s;ome of the&s;e clubs the Books after they have been read by all the &s;ub&s;cribers, are &s;old among them to the highe&s;t bidders, and the money produced by &s;uch &s;ale, is expended in fre&s;h purcha&s;es, by which prudent and ju|dicious mode, each member has it in his pow|er to become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the work of any par|ticular

author he may judge de&s;erving a &s;upe|rior degree of attention; and the members at large enjoy the advantage of a continual &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of different publications, in&s;tead of being re&s;tricted to a repeated peru&s;al of the &s;ame authors; which mu&s;t have been the ca&s;e if &s;o rational a plan had not been adopted.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sunday-Schools</HI> are &s;preading very fa&s;t in mo&s;t parts of England, which will accelerate the diffu&s;&s;ion of knowledge among the lower cla&s;&s;es of the community, and in a very few years exceedingly increa&s;e the &s;ale of Books. &mdash;Here permit me earne&s;tly to call on every hone&s;t book&s;eller, (I tru&s;t my call will not be in vain,) as well as on every friend to the ex|ten&s;ion of knowledge, to unite (as <HI>You,</HI> I am confident will) in a hearty AMEN, with,</P>

<P>THE Public at large, book&s;ellers in parti|cular, have beheld my increa&s;ing &s;tock with the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment, they being in|tirely at a lo&s;s to conceive by what means I have been enabled to make good all my pay|ments; and for &s;everal years, in the beginning of my bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;ome of the trade repeatedly a&s;&s;erted, that it was totally impo&s;&s;ible that I could continue to pay for the large numbers of books that I continually purcha&s;ed; and nine years &s;ince, being induced to take a jour|ney
<PB N="258" REF="289">
into my own country, with a view to the re&s;toration of my health, which had been materially injured by inten&s;e application to catalogue-making, too much reading, &amp;c. during the &s;ix weeks that I retired into the we&s;t, Mrs Lackington was perpetually inter|rogated re&s;pecting the time that I was expect|ed to return. This was done in &s;uch a manner as evidently &s;hewed that many thought I never intended to return at all. But how great was their &s;urprize, when as a prelude to my re|turn, I &s;ent home &s;everal waggon loads of Books which I had purcha&s;ed in the country.</P>
<P>As I never had any part of the <HI>mi&s;er</HI> in my compo&s;ition, I always proportioned my ex|pences according to my profits; that is, I have for many years expended two thirds of the profits of my trade; which proportion of expen|diture I never exceeded.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE open manner of &s;tating my profits will no doubt appear &s;trange to many who are not acquainted with my &s;ingular conduct in that and other re&s;pects. But you, Sir, know that I have for fourteen years pa&s;t kept a &s;trict account of my profits. Every book in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, before it is offered to &s;ale is marked with a private mark, what it co&s;t me, and with a public mark of what it is to be &s;old for; and every article, whether the price is &s;ix-pence or &s;ixty pounds, is en|tered in a day-book as they are &s;old, with the price it co&s;t and the money it &s;old for: and
<PB N="266" REF="297">
each night the profits of the day are ca&s;t up by one of my &s;hopmen, as every one of them under&s;tands my private marks. Every Satur|day night the profits of the week are declared before all my &s;hop-men, &amp;c. the week's pro|fits, and al&s;o the expences of the week are then entered one oppo&s;ite the other, in a book kept for the purpo&s;e: the whole &s;um taken in the week is al&s;o &s;et down, and the &s;um that has been paid for books bought. The&s;e accounts are kept publickly in my &s;hop, and ever have been &s;o, as I never &s;aw any rea&s;on for concealing them. By keeping an account of my profits, and al&s;o of my expences, I have always known how to regulate the latter by the former; and I have done that, without the trifling way of &s;etting down a halfpenny|worth of matches, or a penny for a turnpike. I have one per&s;on in the &s;hop who&s;e con&s;tant employment it is to receive all the ca&s;h, and di&s;charge all bills that are brought for pay|ment, and if Mrs. Lackington wants money
<PB N="267" REF="298">
for hou&s;e-keeping, &amp;c. or if I want money for <HI>hobby-hor&s;es,</HI> &amp;c. we take five or ten gui|neas, pocket it, and &s;et down the &s;um taken out of trade as expended; when that is gone we repeat our application, but never take the trouble of &s;etting down the <HI>items.</HI></P>
<P>It may not be improper here to take a little notice of &s;ome very late in&s;inuations of my old envious <HI>friends.</HI> It has been &s;ugge&s;ted that I am grown <HI>immen&s;ely rich,</HI> and that having already more property than I can rea&s;onably expect to live to expend, and no young fami|ly to provide for, I for the&s;e rea&s;ons ought to decline my bu&s;ine&s;s, and no longer engro&s;s trade to my&s;elf that ought to be divided into a number of channels, and thus &s;upport many families. In an&s;wer to which I will ob&s;erve, that &s;ome of the&s;e objectors were in trade be|fore me, and when I fir&s;t embarked in the profe&s;&s;ion of a book&s;eller, de&s;pi&s;ed me for my mean beginning; and when afterwards I adopted my plan of &s;elling cheap, and for
<PB N="268" REF="299">
ready money only, made them&s;elves very merry at my expence, for expecting to &s;uc|ceed by &s;o <HI>ridiculous</HI> a project, (as they in their con&s;ummate wi&s;dom were plea&s;ed to term it) &s;o that no doubt I ought to comply with any thing they de&s;ire, however unrea&s;onable it may appear to me.</P>
<P>To deny that I have a competence, would be unpardonable ingratitude to the Public, to go no higher; but to in&s;inuate that I am getting money for no good purpo&s;e, is fal&s;e. The great apo&s;tle St. Paul, who was an hum|ble follower of CHRIST, thought that he might be permitted to boa&s;t of him&s;elf a little; after which I &s;uppo&s;e it will not be thought very pre&s;umptuous in me, if I &s;hould &s;tate a few facts, merely to ju&s;tify my conduct in carrying on my trade beyond the time that certain per|&s;ons would pre&s;cribe to me.</P>
<P>It is now about five years &s;ince I began to entertain &s;erious thoughts of going out of bu&s;ine&s;s on account of the bad &s;tate of health
<PB N="269" REF="300">
which both Mrs. Lackington and my&s;elf have laboured under; but it was then &s;ugge&s;ted by &s;everal of my friends, that as I had many poor relations, a great number of whom are children, others are old and nearly helple&s;s, and that all had ju&s;tly formed &s;ome expecta|tions from me: therefore to give up &s;uch a trade as I was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, before I was ab&s;olutely obliged to do it, would be a kind of <HI>inju&s;tice</HI> to tho&s;e whom by the ties of blood I was in &s;ome mea&s;ure bound to relieve and protect. The&s;e and other con&s;iderations in|duced me to wave the thoughts of precipi|tating my&s;elf out of &s;o exten&s;ive and lucrative a bu&s;ine&s;s; and in the mean time I apply a part of the profits of it to maintain my good old Mother, who is alive at Wellington in Somer&s;et&s;hire, her native place. I have two aged men and one aged woman, whom I &s;up|port: and I have al&s;o four children to main|tain and educate, three of the&s;e children have lo&s;t their father, and al&s;o their mother, (who
<PB N="270" REF="301">
was my &s;i&s;ter) the other child has both his parents living, but they are poor; many others of my relations are in the &s;ame circum|&s;tances, and &s;tand in need of my a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But&mdash;&mdash;

<P>It has al&s;o been frequently &s;aid, that by &s;elling my books very cheap, I have materially injured other book&s;ellers both in town and country. But I &s;till deny the charge: and here I will fir&s;t ob&s;erve, that I have as ju&s;t a rea&s;on to complain of them for giving credit, as they can have for my &s;elling cheap and giv|ing <HI>no</HI> credit; as it is well known that there are many thou&s;ands of people every where to be found who will decline purcha&s;ing at a &s;hop where credit is denied, when they can find many that will readily give it; and as I frequently lo&s;e cu&s;tomers who having always been u&s;ed to have credit, will not take the trouble to pay for every article as &s;ent home;
<PB N="271" REF="302">
the&s;e of cour&s;e deal at tho&s;e &s;hops who follow the old mode of bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;o that in &s;uch ca&s;es, I might &s;ay to the proprietors of the&s;e &s;hops, <Q>&startq;You ought not to give any per&s;on credit: becau&s;e by &s;o doing you are taking &endq;cu&s;tomers from me.</Q> As to my <HI>hurting the trade</HI> by &s;elling <HI>cheap,</HI> they are, upon the whole mi&s;taken; for although no doubt &s;ome in&s;tances will occur, in which they may ob|&s;erve that the preference is given to <HI>my</HI> &s;hop, and the books purcha&s;ed of me on account of their being cheap, they never con&s;ider how many books they di&s;po&s;e of on the very &s;ame account. As, however, this may ap|pear rather paradoxical, I will explain my meaning farther:</P>
<P>I now &s;ell more than one hundred thou&s;and volumes annually; many who purcha&s;e part of the&s;e, do &s;o &s;olely on account of their cheap|ne&s;s; many thou&s;ands of the&s;e books would have been de&s;troyed, as I have before remark|ed, but for my &s;elling them on tho&s;e very
<PB N="272" REF="303">
moderate terms; now when thou&s;ands of the&s;e articles are &s;old, they become known by being handed about in various circles of ac|quaintances, many of whom wi&s;hing to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ame books without enquiring the price of their friends, &s;tep into the fir&s;t book&s;eller's &s;hop, and give their orders for ar|ticles which they never would have heard of, had not I, by &s;elling them cheap, been the original cau&s;e of their being di&s;per&s;ed abroad; &s;o that by means of the plan pur&s;ued in my &s;hop, whole editions of books are &s;old off, and new editions printed of the works of au|thors, who but for that circum&s;tance would have been &s;carce noticed at all.</P>
<P>I could relate much more on this &s;ub|ject, but will not unnece&s;&s;arily take up your time, as I tru&s;t what is here advanced will convey full conviction to your mind, and as I believe it is univer&s;ally allowed that no man ever promoted the &s;ale of books in an equal degree, with,</P>

it mu&s;t be evident, the engagements which from time to time have fully engro&s;&s;ed my attention, have not furni&s;hed me with any opportunity of making the tour of Europe, or tracing the &s;ource of the river Nile, much le&s;s circumnavigating the globe. And even &s;up|po&s;ing I had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed both of the time and inclination for &s;uch exten&s;ive undertak|ings, the di&s;advantages which I labour un|der for want of having received a proper edu|cation, would have di&s;qualified me from ma|king &s;uch remarks and ob&s;ervations as natu|rally pre&s;ent them&s;elves to tho&s;e who have been fortunate enough to po&s;&s;e&s;s that advan|tage, and of cour&s;e are qualified to pre&s;ent the world with a variety of &s;ubjects equally curi|ous and in&s;tructive; 'though it is not without reluctance I think it nece&s;&s;ary here to ob&s;erve, that &s;ome of the&s;e gentlemen, not content with giving a true account of what actually occurred to them, and &s;uppo&s;ing that plain matter of fact would not be &s;ufficiently inte|re&s;ting
<PB N="275" REF="306">
to excite that &s;uperior degree of atten|tion and admiration which they were ambi|tious as authors to acquire, they have thought proper to intermix &s;o much of the <HI>marvellous</HI> into their narrations, as has been the occa&s;ion of many per&s;ons reading them with &s;uch diffi|dence, as to doubt the truth of many rela|tions, which though really &s;trictly con&s;i&s;tent with veracity, yet being novel and uncom|mon, they were unwilling to credit, le&s;t they &s;hould incur the cen&s;ure of being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;uperior degree of weakne&s;s and credulity. This I am al&s;o confident has induced many a mode&s;t author to omit pa&s;&s;ages, which though really true, he was cautious of publi&s;hing, from a fear of being &s;ubjected to the &s;ame &s;e|vere animadver&s;ions, or what is &s;till wor&s;e, being &s;u&s;pected of wilfully impo&s;ing on his readers. Recent in&s;tances of which, were it nece&s;&s;ary, I could adduce; but I &s;hall proceed with cautioning you from being alarmed le&s;t I &s;hould fall into either of the&s;e errors; no|thing
<PB N="276" REF="307">
<HI>very marvellous</HI> will occur in what I mean to pre&s;ent you with; though I &s;hall not be intimidated from relating <HI>real facts,</HI> from the apprehen&s;ion of not being credited.

But you, my dear friend, are not &s;o fa&s;tidious a critic: although you may find the whole very <HI>dull,</HI> it &s;hall not be very <HI>long</HI>; &s;o that if it does not act as a cordial to enliven your &s;pi|rits, it may (if read in the evening) prove a powerful <HI>narcotic,</HI> and afford you &s;ome plea|&s;ing dreams, when <Q><PB N="277" REF="308">

I &s;hall therefore not trouble you with a detail of bad roads, the impo&s;itions of innkeepers, what food I partook of, how many bottles of wine were drank, the height of &s;teeples, &amp;c. a &s;ufficiency of this, I tru&s;t, has already ap|peared in different writers. Thus much by way of preparation for my journies. I now &s;et out.</P>
<P>In <HI>September,</HI> Seventeen hundred and eighty-&s;even, I &s;et off for Edinburgh; and in all the principal towns through which I pa&s;&s;ed, was led from a motive of curio&s;ity, as well as with a view towards obtaining &s;ome valuable purcha|&s;es, to examine the Book&s;ellers &s;hops for &s;carce and curious books; but although I went by the way of York, Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, &amp;c. and returned through Gla&s;gow, Carli&s;le, Leeds, Lanca&s;ter, Pre&s;ton, Manche&s;ter, and other con&s;iderable places, I was much &s;urpri|zed, as well as di&s;appointed, at meeting with
<PB N="278" REF="309">
very few of the works of the mo&s;t e&s;teemed authors; and tho&s;e few con&s;i&s;ted in general of ordinary editions, be&s;ides an a&s;&s;emblage of common trifling books, bound in &s;heep, and that too in a very bad manner. It is true, at York and Leeds there were a few (and but very few) good books; but in all the other towns between London and Edinburgh no|thing but tra&s;h was to be found: in the latter city indeed, a few capital articles are kept, but in no other part of Scotland.</P>
<P>In Seventeen hundred and ninety, I re|peated my journey, and was much mortified to be under a nece&s;&s;ity of confirming my for|mer ob&s;ervations. This remarkable deficien|cy in the article of books, is however not pe|culiar to the northern parts of England; as I have repeatedly travelled into the we&s;tern parts, and found abundant cau&s;e for di&s;atisfac|tion on the &s;ame account, &s;o that I may ven|ture without fear of contradiction to a&s;&s;ert, that London, as in all other articles of com|merce,
<PB N="279" REF="310">
is likewi&s;e the grand emporium of Great Britain for books, engro&s;&s;ing nearly the whole of what is valuable in that very exten|&s;ive, beneficial, and I may add lucrative branch of trade. As to Ireland, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that if the book&s;ellers in that part of the empire do not &s;hine in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of va|luable books, they mu&s;t certainly be allowed to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uperior indu&s;try in reprinting the works of every engli&s;h author of merit, as &s;oon as publi&s;hed, and very liberally endeavouring to di&s;&s;eminate them, in a &s;urreptitious manner through every part of our I&s;land, though the attempt frequently proves abortive, to the great lo&s;s and injury of the projectors.</P>
<P>At Newca&s;tle, I pa&s;&s;ed a day or two in the year 1787, where I was much delighted with viewing a &s;ingular phoenomenon in natural hi&s;|tory, namely the celebrated <HI>crows-ne&s;t</HI> affixed above the weather-cock, on the upper extre|mity of the &s;teeple in the market-place. In the year 1783, as I was well informed, the crows
<PB N="280" REF="311">
fir&s;t built this curious ne&s;t, and &s;ucceeded in hatching and rearing their young. In the fol|lowing year they attempted to rebuild it: but a conte&s;t en&s;uing among &s;ome of the &s;able fra|ternity, after a fierce engagement they were obliged to relinqui&s;h it, and the ne&s;t was de|moli&s;hed by the victorious party before it was fini&s;hed. This bad &s;ucce&s;s, however, did not deter the original builders and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors from returning in the year 1785, when they took quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their freehold, rebuilt the premi&s;es, and reared another family. This they repeated the three following years with equal &s;ucce&s;s, and when I was there in the year 1790, much of the ne&s;t remained, but the crows had for&s;aken it. The above occur|rence, though to many it may appear incredi|ble, is an undoubted fact. That <HI>crows</HI> &s;hould come into the center of a populous town to build their ne&s;ts, is of it&s;elf remarkable; but much more &s;o, that they &s;hould prefer a wea|thercock to any other &s;ituation, where the
<PB N="281" REF="312">
whole family, and their habitation turned round with every puff of wind, though they were perfectly &s;ecured from falling, by the &s;pike of iron which ro&s;e above the fane, a|round which the whole made their revolutions; and as on one &s;ide the ne&s;t was higher than on the other, that part being always to wind|ward, by this ingenious contrivance of the feathered architects, the in&s;ide of the ne&s;t was con&s;tantly kept in a proper degree of warmth. I never recollect the&s;e various circum&s;tances, without being lo&s;t in admiration at the extra|ordinary &s;agacity of the&s;e birds.</P>
<P>In this town however, I met with a great|er curio&s;ity, as well as a more amiable &s;ubject of it than a crow's ne&s;t, to excite my a&s;toni&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fi&s;her</HI> the book&s;eller introduced me to his daughter, a charming young lady, who being unfortunately born deaf, was con&s;e|quently dumb, till a gentleman a few years &s;ince taught her to under&s;tand what was &s;aid
<PB N="282" REF="313">
to her by the motion of the lips. I had the plea&s;ure of conver&s;ing with her &s;everal times&punc; and found that &s;he had much of the Scotch dialect, which as Mr. Fi&s;her informed me, &s;he acquired of the gentleman who taught her not only to under&s;tand the conver&s;ation of others, but to <HI>&s;peak,</HI> he being a native of that country; he remarked al&s;o, that &s;he never had &s;poken the Newca&s;tle dialect. This young lady, I was al&s;o informed, dances exceedingly well, keeping exact time with the mu&s;ic, whether it is played &s;low or quick. When it is con&s;idered what an inten&s;e application mu&s;t have been u&s;ed, both on the part of the teacher and his fair pupil, to produce &s;uch a happy effect, it &s;urely reflects great credit on each of the parties.</P>
<P>In the year 1790, when I again vi&s;ited New|ca&s;tle with Mrs. Lackington, &s;he became the fir&s;t object of inquiry, and we were both in|troduced to her.</P>
<P>Being on the &s;ubject of <HI>Curio&s;ities,</HI> and hav|ing

<P>At the town-hall I was &s;hewn a piece of antiquity called a <HI>Brank.</HI> It con&s;i&s;ts of a com|bination of iron fillets, and is fa&s;tened to the head by a lock fixed to the back part of it; a thin plate of iron goes into the mouth, &s;uf|ficiently

The u&s;e of this piece of machinery is to puni&s;h notorious <HI>&s;colds.</HI> I am plea&s;ed to find that it is now con&s;idered merely as a matter of curio&s;ity, the ladies of that town happily having not the &s;malle&s;t occa&s;ion for the application of &s;o har&s;h an in&s;trument: whether it is that all ladies, apprehen&s;ive of being included in <HI>that</HI> de&s;crip|tion, have travelled Southward, to avoid the danger of &s;o degrading an exhibition, or what|ever other rea&s;on is a&s;&s;igned, I forgot to in|quire. It however affords me plea&s;ure to re|flect, that the ladies of Newca&s;tle are left at liberty to adopt a head-dre&s;s of their own choo&s;ing, confident that they po&s;&s;e&s;s a more refined ta&s;te than to &s;ix upon one by no means calculated to di&s;play their lovely countenances to advantage, as I am per&s;uaded the <HI>Brank</HI> would ca&s;t &s;uch a gloom on the faire&s;t of them, as would tend much to dimini&s;h the influence

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my fir&s;t journey to Scotland I &s;ometimes travelled po&s;t, but often entered the diffe|rent, &s;tage-coaches, &amp;c. for a &s;tage or two, when I happened to &s;ee any &s;etting out &s;o as to &s;uit my time and inclination: But at la&s;t I had pretty nearly paid dear for it, as the dri|ver of the Diligence from Darlington to Dur|ham happened to be much inebriated and be|fore
<PB N="288" REF="319">
his quitting Darlington had almo&s;t over&s;et us. Not ob&s;erving that the man was drunk, we attributed the fault to the hor&s;es, but we were very &s;peedily undeceived in that re|&s;pect by many convincing circum&s;tances, &s;o that we were one minute nearly in the ditch on the right hand, and the next but ju&s;t e&s;cap|ed that on the left; at other times we experi|enced <HI>&s;triking proofs</HI> of the inability of our con|ductor again&s;t the numbers of one-hor&s;e <HI>coal-carts,</HI> not to mention their frequently running foul of us for being on the wrong &s;ide of the road; (for drivers of coaches and carts can be to the full as &s;avage towards each other there, as in London): however notwith&s;tand|ing all the&s;e "hair-breadth e&s;capes," we re|tained our &s;eats, till we arrived within three quarters of a mile of Durham, when at length the &s;pecific gravity of the driver's head prepon|derating over all the other parts of his frame united, precipitated him with violence from the elevated &s;tation he till then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed,
<PB N="289" REF="320">
(though with difficulty) to his parent earth. There were three unfortunate pa&s;&s;engers in the carriage, left to the di&s;cretion of the hor&s;es, viz. a gentleman, an innkeeper's wife, and your humble &s;ervant: the lady in &s;trict com|pliance with the practice of her &s;ex in &s;imilar &s;ituations, on &s;eeing the rapid de&s;cent of our charioteer, immediately honoured us with a loud and &s;hrill &s;hriek; this, the <HI>quadrupeds,</HI> not accu&s;tomed to this pretty female note &s;o much as the &s;onorous voice of a coachman, mi&s;took for a &s;ignal to mend their pace, and they, habituated to pay all due obedience to the commands of their &s;uperiors of the biped creation, when under&s;tood by them, and finding no check, in&s;tantly proceeded to a full gallop; and we, however reluctantly, fol|lowed them down a gentle de&s;cent, not at a <HI>gentle</HI> rate, but with prodigious velocity. As I was quite calm and collected, I coolly recon|noitred the road before us, and ob&s;erving that it was perfectly clear, as for half a mile not a
<PB N="290" REF="321">
coal-cart was to be &s;een, although we had pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal &s;cores, I began to rea&s;on with my companions, and they &s;peedily became calm enough to a&s;&s;i&s;t in holding a council what was be&s;t to be done in our critical &s;itua|tion. Our debates were quickly ended, as we were unanimous in opinion that if we once entered the city of Durham, the carriage mu&s;t inevitably be torn to pieces, owing to the va|riety of turnings and ob&s;tructions we &s;hould have to encounter, we therefore entered into an immediate re&s;olution, <HI>nem. con.</HI> that to open the doors, and exhibit our agility by leaping out, was, of "two evils, choo&s;ing the lea&s;t:" this we in&s;tantly did, in as careful a manner as po&s;&s;ible; we fir&s;t alighted on our feet, and next complimented the ground with our no&s;es, without receiving much injury. Our female companion indeed, by being ra|ther too precipitate, alighted in a manner which on any other occa&s;ion would not have appeared &s;trictly decent, of which &s;he, poor
<PB N="291" REF="322">
lady! was &s;o &s;en&s;ible, that &s;he immediately "hoped <HI>as how</HI> we were both <HI>married</HI> gentle|men;" which was quickly replied to by both in the affirmative; and thus we &s;aved our fair one the trouble of exerting her&s;elf in another &s;cream, and our&s;elves the puni&s;hment of hear|ing it.</P>
<P>Being no longer parties concerned in the danger, it afforded us &s;ome entertainment to ob&s;erve the progre&s;s of our vehicle now con&s;i|derably lightened by our e&s;cape from it, and becoming every moment &s;till lighter by the exclu&s;ion of &s;mall trunks, boxes, parcels, great coats, &amp;c. they, in imitation of our ex|ample making leaps, &s;ome from the in&s;ide of the carriage, and others from the boot; whether occa&s;ioned by the <HI>repul&s;ion</HI> of the car|riage and its appendages, or the <HI>attraction</HI> of the earth, I am not &s;ufficiently ver&s;ed in phi|lo&s;ophy to decide. Po&s;terity when they pe|ru&s;e my labours, no doubt will determine this <HI>weighty</HI> point, and tran&s;mit it to the remote&s;t
<PB N="292" REF="323">
period of time, properly dignified by <HI>F. R. S.</HI> in <HI>Phil. Tran&s;.</HI></P>
<P>The hor&s;es finding them&s;elves le&s;s incum|bered and urged on by the noi&s;e of the doors continually flapping, increa&s;ed their &s;peed: happily however the carriage was &s;topped be|fore it entered the city, and no damage was &s;u&s;tained either by the hor&s;es or the carriage. Before we left the inn, our careful <HI>&s;on of the whip</HI> arrived, not in the lea&s;t injured, but ra|ther benefited by his di&s;a&s;ter, being &s;uddenly transformed into a &s;tate of perfect &s;obriety; after him followed two countrymen laden with the &s;everal articles which had been &s;o violently ejected. As I reflected that this un|guarded man might not always be equally &s;ucce&s;sful, either to him&s;elf or his pa&s;&s;engers, as in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, I obtained a promi&s;e from the innkeeper never to permit him to drive any carriage in future, in the manage|ment of which he had any concern.</P>
<P>It is a&s;toni&s;hing what a number of fatal ac|cidents
<PB N="293" REF="324">
continually happen from carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and the want of &s;obriety in this thoughtle&s;s race of beings. I was informed that only two days previous to my arrival at Durham, a coachman quitting his box to &s;tep into an adjacent hou&s;e, in his ab&s;ence the hor&s;es be|gan to move gently, and a Lady in the car|riage giving a loud &s;cream, the noi&s;e occa&s;ion|ed the hor&s;es to &s;et off full gallop, in con&s;e|quence of which a lady of Durham, happen|ing unfortunately at that in&s;tant to be cro&s;&s;ing the way, was thrown down, and the wheels pa&s;&s;ing over her, &s;he died on the &s;pot.&mdash;One of the many melancholy effects re&s;ulting from the ridiculous practi&s;e of &s;creaming. But I crave pardon of the ladies; when I begin pa&s;&s;|ing cen&s;ure on them, 'tis high time to clo&s;e my epi&s;tle, (which if not very long will per|haps be deemed &s;ufficiently impertinent) with,</P>

<P>IT is reported of a very eminent author, that he never blotted a line of what he had once written: on which it has been remark|ed, that it was a pity he had not blotted a thou&s;and. Now though my extreme mode&s;ty will not permit me to put my&s;elf on a level with that great man as an author, whatever
<GAP DESC="MISSING" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="295" REF="326">
the impartial world may think of our compara|tive merits, I mu&s;t confe&s;s I do not like to blot what I have once written, fearful le&s;t when I begin, (another proof of my mode&s;ty,) I &s;hould deface the major part of my manu&s;cripts and thus deprive the public of the great ad|vantages which may re&s;ult from them. What I allude to, is an unfortunate &s;lip of the pen in my la&s;t; however, as "confe&s;&s;ion of a fault makes &s;ome amends," and I immediate|ly checked my&s;elf, craved pardon, abruptly clo&s;ed my letter, and threw the offending pen from me with &s;ome degree of anger, I hope tho&s;e lovely fair ones, who might think I meant to affront them, will with their accu&s;|tomed benignity forgive, and indulge me with a &s;mile on my future labours; and as a convincing proof how &s;en&s;ible I am of their kind conde&s;cen&s;ion, I here engage never more to expre&s;s my di&s;like of their <HI>&s;creaming,</HI> except they &s;hould omit pur|cha&s;ing books of me, which I am &s;ure every
<PB N="296" REF="327">
candid fair (and what <HI>fair</HI> one is not can|did?) will think &s;ufficiently provoking.</P>
<P>But in order to remind them that every great man does not always conduct him&s;elf with equal politene&s;s towards the Ladies, I beg permi&s;&s;ion to introduce a <HI>very</HI> great man to them: no le&s;s a per&s;onage than Doctor JOHN|SON. Of whom indeed &s;o much hath already been &s;ung and &s;aid, that the &s;ubject may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be nearly exhau&s;ted; which is, however, &s;o far from being the ca&s;e, that not|with&s;tanding two quarto volumes of his life by Mr. Bo&s;well are ju&s;t publi&s;hed, we are taught to expect another life by a different hand. In|deed until &s;ome other great man makes his exit (my&s;elf out of the que&s;tion) we are likely to be entertained with fre&s;h anecdotes of him; but when that period once arrives, then farewell <HI>John&s;on</HI>!</P>
<P>The Doctor, who&s;e extreme fondne&s;s for that agreeable beverage <HI>Tea,</HI> is well known, was once in company with a number of ladies
<PB N="297" REF="328">
a&s;&s;embled to partake with him of the &s;ame refre&s;hment. The lady of the hou&s;e happen|ed to be one of tho&s;e particularly attentive to punctilio, and had exhibited her fine&s;t &s;et of china for the entertainment of her gue&s;ts; the Doctor, who drank large quantities, and with con&s;iderable expedition, could not always wait with becoming patience ceremoniou&s;ly to a&s;k for and receive in due form the addition of a lump of &s;ugar when nece&s;&s;ary; he there|fore without permi&s;&s;ion put his finger and thumb into the &s;ugar-di&s;h, tumbling the con|tents over, till he met with a piece of the pro|per &s;ize; the lady kept her eye fixed on him the whole time, and deeming his conduct a great breach of decorum, re&s;olved to make him &s;en&s;ible of it, by immediately ordering the &s;ervant to change the &s;ugar-di&s;h. The Doctor, tho' apparently attentive only to his tea, noticed it, and as &s;oon as he had emptied the cup, put it together with the &s;aucer under the fire-place, with due care, however, not to
<PB N="298" REF="329">
break them. This was too &s;evere a trial for the poor lady, who, apprehen&s;ive for the fate of her dear china, after a decent &s;cream, with warmth demanded the rea&s;on of his treating her in &s;o rude a manner. <Q>&startq;Why, my dear madam, (replied he) I was alarmed with the idea that whatever I touched was there|by contaminated, and impre&s;&s;ed with anxi|ous de&s;ire to contribute towards your felicity, I removed the object &s;o defiled from your &endq;pre&s;ence with all po&s;&s;ible expedition.</Q> This reply, though it extorted a &s;mile from all the company pre&s;ent, did not &s;atisfy the lady to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed, who notwith&s;tanding &s;he exerted her&s;elf to appear in good humour, was too much offended to forget the affront.&mdash; This anecdote has been related to me with &s;ome <HI>addenda</HI> which heighten the &s;tory, though more to the di&s;advantage of the Doctor; but I believe as here related, it may be depended on as the real fact.</P>
<P>During my continuance in Scotland, which
<PB N="299" REF="330">
was about three weeks the fir&s;t time, and about a month the la&s;t, I often reflected with pain on the illiberal, not to &s;ay brutal treatment the inhabitants received from the Doctor. At Edinburgh I heard various anecdotes related of him, which were perfectly novel to me, and in all probability will be &s;o to you. I &s;hall therefore give you a &s;pecimen:</P>
<P>Being one day at a gentleman's hou&s;e in Edinburgh, &s;everal ladies and gentlemen came in to pay their re&s;pects to him; and among others the then Lord Provo&s;t went up to the Doctor, bowing repeatedly, and expre&s;&s;ing the highe&s;t re&s;pect for him, to all which the Doc|tor paid not the lea&s;t attention. Exceedingly hurt at &s;o flagrant a mark of di&s;re&s;pect, he turned round, putting a &s;hilling into the hand of the gentleman of the hou&s;e: On being a&s;ked what the &s;hilling was intended for, he replied, "Have not I &s;een your <HI>bear?"</HI></P>
<P>The Doctor being drinking tea at another gentleman's hou&s;e, the lady a&s;ked him if he
<PB N="300" REF="331">
did not choo&s;e another cup: It &s;eems &s;he had forgot her having before a&s;ked him the &s;ame que&s;tion; and on her repeating it he replied, <Q>&startq;Woman, have I not already told you that &endq;I had done?</Q> On which the lady an&s;wer|ed him in his own gruff manner. During his continuance in her hou&s;e &s;he always talked to him without ceremony, and it was remark|ed that &s;he had more influence with him than any other per&s;on in Scotland.</P>
<P>I was much plea&s;ed with the politene&s;s of the gentleman who related me this &s;tory of the Doctor, as he appeared anxious to excu&s;e him for his want of due decorum, and thus to palliate one of the mo&s;t obvious blemi&s;hes in the character of one of the mo&s;t eminent of my countrymen. I could wi&s;h the compilers of the biographical department of that truly great and u&s;eful work, the <HI>"Encyclopoedia Britannica"</HI> would ob&s;erve the &s;ame polite|ne&s;s. And I hope that this hint will al&s;o in|duce them in &s;ome &s;ub&s;equent edition, when
<PB N="301" REF="332">
I am gone to
<Q>"That Bourne from whence no traveller returns,"</Q>
to do ju&s;tice to my <HI>great and a&s;toni&s;hing me|rits,</HI> by way of compen&s;ation for having fal|len &s;hort in &s;peaking of other <HI>great men</HI>; and &s;hould I happen to be <HI>out of print</HI> by the time the editors of the <HI>Biographia Britannica</HI> ar|rive at letter <HI>L.</HI> which &s;eems extremely pro|bable, according to the very deliberate pro|gre&s;s of that work, I hope they will not &s;lightly pa&s;s <HI>me</HI> over. If they &s;hould, let them take the con&s;equence: as I here give them fair and timely notice, and they have not to plead as an excu&s;e, the want of ma|terials.</P>
<P>One word more concerning our great Lexi|cographer. It mu&s;t be allowed by every candid and impartial per&s;on, that the ex|treme contempt and prejudice he entertained towards our friends of <HI>North</HI> Britain reflected a very &s;trong &s;hade on his character, which his warme&s;t admirers cannot ju&s;tify.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="333">Were I, as a South Briton, called upon to give my fair and unprejudiced opinion re&s;pecting national character of the natives of Scotland and tho&s;e of England, and I flatter my&s;elf I have had ample opportunities of ob&s;erving the peculiar traits of both countries, I would &s;ay, that if we in England excel them in &s;ome virtues, they no le&s;s &s;hine in others, and if the North-Britons po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome peculiar frail|ties and prejudices, we of the South are not intirely free from others; &s;o that were the virtues and vices of a certain number of each country placed in an hydro&s;tatical balance (it mu&s;t however be a pretty large one), I believe it very difficult to progno&s;ticate which of the two would preponderate. It is true, I have met with one very great villain in Scotland, in Mr. S. which only tends to prove there are probably <HI>&s;cound$els</HI> to be found every where, and that without taking the trouble which Diogenes did, in &s;earch of an <HI>hone&s;t man</HI>; and I am much afraid, were I to enquire of &s;ome
<PB N="303" REF="334">
North Britons, they could without any great difficulty point out to me &s;ome of my own countrymen as bad.</P>
<P>For my part I dete&s;t all national prejudices, as I think it betrays great weakne&s;s in the par|ties who are influenced by them. Each nation of the habitable globe, nay each province of tho&s;e countries has certainly &s;ome peculiar traits belonging to it which di&s;tingui&s;hes it from its neighbours. But if we are di&s;po&s;ed to view one another with the &s;everity of critici&s;m, how ea&s;y, nay how frequent it is to di&s;cover &s;u|perior virtues (as we think) as well as abilities in that particular &s;pot which gave birth to our|&s;elves, and equally dive&s;ted of that &s;trictim|partiality which alone can enable us to judge properly, di&s;cover proportionable blemi&s;hes in the natives of other countries. In &s;aying thus much, I do not mean to infer, that we ought not to be in&s;pired with a laudable ambition to excel, not ho&s;e of other countries only, but even tho&s;e with whom we are more intimately
<PB N="304" REF="335">
connected: but that &s;hould be done without drawing invidious compari&s;ons of the merits or demerits of others. In &s;hort, let it be the earne&s;t endeavour of each country, and every individual of that country in particular, united under our amiable monarch, to &s;trive which &s;hall have a &s;uperior claim to the title of be|ing GOOD MEN, u&s;eful members of Society, Friends to the whole human race, and peace|able Subjects of a Government, which though not ab&s;olutely in a &s;tate of <HI>perfection</HI>&mdash;(and can that man be really deemed <HI>wi&s;e</HI> who ex|pects to meet with perfection in any human e&s;tabli&s;hment?) is &s;till happily &s;uperior to every other in the known world, not forget|ting our neighbours the French, our <HI>natural enemies,</HI> according to the long adopted language of national prejudice: but I hope that narrow minded di&s;po&s;ition will henceforth cea&s;e; certainly nature never de&s;igned us as enemies, it has placed our &s;tations near to each other, and &s;urely there is not &s;o great a di&s;&s;imilarity
<PB N="305" REF="336">
in our national traits of character, as to occa|&s;ion us to be in perpetual enmity! The contra&s;t now is le&s;s than ever. Like Britons, they have caught the &s;park of freedom, and nobly eman|cipated them&s;elves from a &s;tate of abject and degrading &s;lavery, to a di&s;tingui&s;hed and ho|nourable rank among nations. Long as time &s;hall la&s;t, may they, with us, enjoy the ble&s;|&s;ing &s;o gloriou&s;ly obtained, with that due mode|ration which always properly di&s;tingui&s;hes be|tween <HI>liberty</HI> and <HI>licentiou&s;ne&s;s</HI>! The friends of <HI>liberty</HI> merit the full enjoyment of every ad|vantage attending it; tho&s;e of <HI>licentiou&s;ne&s;s</HI> are unworthy the &s;malle&s;t &s;hare of it.</P>
<P>But whither am I <HI>travelling</HI>? I am imper|ceptibly got into the road of politics. Coach|man! turn off immediately into another road.&mdash; 'Tis done, and happy am I to get out of &s;o dangerous a track unhurt, which has broke the necks of numbers of clever fellows, and deprived many a bright genius of that &s;uperior part of HIM from whence all his bright effu|&s;ions
<PB N="306" REF="337">
for the good of his country were emit|ted. For <HI>patrioti&s;m</HI> (as you know) is always the motive which impels tho&s;e worthies to &s;uch hazardous expeditions as have &s;o fre|quently in the event proved fatal to them. For proofs we need not con&s;ult hi&s;tory; in|&s;tances are, alas! fre&s;h in our memories: wit|ne&s;s London, 1780. and Birmingham, 1791!</P>
<P>At all events, it is certainly too rugged a road for a book&s;eller to travel, it being already crowded with many much abler adventurers. And whil&s;t Mr. Burke, of the "Monarchy" (late of the "Fox") Inn, and Mr. Paine, at the &s;ign of "the RIGHTS of MAN" provide rich and ample entertainment for "men and cat|tle," let the public take their choice, or if they plea&s;e (which indeed is the mo&s;t rational mode), try them both, as &s;ome con&s;titutions find one kind of food more ea&s;y of <HI>dige&s;tion,</HI> &s;ome the other; and I remain fully &s;atisfied with the &s;ubordinate character of continuing an humble di&s;tributor of the viands provided by
<PB N="307" REF="338">
tho&s;e and other very able caterers, and that upon ea&s;ier terms than the admirers of &s;uch food will meet with el&s;ewhere, according to the elegance or plainne&s;s of the <HI>di&s;hes</HI> they are <HI>&s;erved up</HI> in. Some preferring <HI>rich foreign china, elegantly gilt</HI>; others, good &s;ub&s;tantial <HI>Engli&s;h porcelain</HI>; others, again being plea&s;ed with <HI>Queen's ware</HI>; and many more content with a <HI>Welch di&s;h,</HI> or common <HI>earthen ware.</HI></P>
<P>I am now &s;uddenly conveyed again to Edin|burgh. The old town, &s;o called, has not much to boa&s;t of; but the new town is by far the mo&s;t compleat and elegant I ever &s;aw. In various towns of England and Scotland, I have indeed &s;een &s;ome good &s;treets, and many good hou&s;es, but in this the whole is uni|formly fine: not one hou&s;e, much le&s;s a whole &s;treet that can be termed indifferent in the whole town.</P>
<P>And here let me do ju&s;tice to North-Briti&s;h ho&s;pitality, and their very polite attention to &s;uch Engli&s;hmen who happen to travel to the
<PB N="308" REF="339">
"land of cakes." I can truly &s;ay, that the polit$ and friendly behaviour of the inhabitants to+wards Mrs Lackington and my&s;elf, claims ou$ warme&s;t gratitude and &s;incere&s;t thanks.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my la&s;t I expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome diffidence re|&s;pecting the propriety of committing to paper my thoughts on a particular &s;ubject, I have &s;ince weighed it with due caution, and the con&s;ideration of my having during
<PB N="310" REF="341">
the long cour&s;e of my epi&s;tolary corre&s;pon|dence always declared my &s;entiments freely on every &s;ubject, &s;oon determined me not to degrade my&s;elf by &s;hrinking back, now it is &s;o near drawing to a conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject then is&mdash;that bright lovely part of the creation, WOMAN!&mdash;the &s;ource of all our joys, the a&s;&s;uagers of all our griefs; deprived of who&s;e powerful and attractive charms, man would be a wretch indeed. But alas! the utmo&s;t efforts of my abilities are far inadequate to do ju&s;tice to their me|rits: happily that plea&s;ing theme has en|gaged the attention of the able&s;t and worthie&s;t of men, from the remote&s;t period down to the pre&s;ent time; and I tru&s;t ever will, nay mu&s;t, &s;o long as a &s;park of virtue remains to dwell in the human brea&s;t. And when I reflect, that
<Q>"They are not only FAIR, but JUST as fair,"</Q>
I have nought to fear.</P>
<P>I therefore proceed with cheerfulne&s;s to &s;ay,
<PB N="311" REF="342">
that in Edinburgh, Gla&s;cow, Sterling, &amp;c. there are more really fine women to be found than in any place I ever vi&s;ited. &mdash; I do not mean to infer, we have not as many hand|&s;ome women in England; but the only idea I wi&s;h to convey is, we have not &s;o many <HI>in proportion</HI>: that is, Go to any public place where a number of Ladies are a&s;&s;embled, in either of the above towns, and then go to any place in England where an equal number are met, and you will notice a greater number of fine women among the former, than among the latter. It mu&s;t be obvious that in making this declaration, I allude to the genteeler part; for among the lower cla&s;&s;es of women, the majority are very homely, and the want of the advantages of apparel, (which tho&s;e in a higher &s;phere can avail them&s;elves of, and know how to apply) together with their &s;lut|ti&s;h and negligent appearance, does not tend in the lea&s;t to heighten their charms.</P>
<P>Having both read and heard much related of
<PB N="312" REF="343">
the manner of wa&s;hing their linen, which I mu&s;t confe&s;s I would not credit without hav|ing ocular demon&s;tration; during my conti|nuance at Gla&s;cow, curio&s;ity led me to the mead by the river &s;ide. For the poor women here, in&s;tead of the water coming to them, as in London, are obliged to travel loaded with their linen to the water; where you may daily &s;ee great numbers wa&s;hing, in <HI>their</HI> way; which if &s;een by &s;ome of our London prudes, would incline them to form very unju&s;t and uncharitable ideas of the mode&s;ty of the&s;e Scotti&s;h La&s;&s;ies. Many of them give a trifle to be accommodated with the u&s;e of a large wa&s;h-hou&s;e near the water, where about a hundred may be furni&s;hed with every conve|nience for their purpo&s;e. But by far the great|e&s;t part make fires, and heat the water in the open air, and as they fini&s;h their linen, they &s;pread it on the gra&s;s to dry; which is the uni|ver&s;al mode of drying throughout Scotland.</P>
<P>I had walked to and fro &s;everal times, and
<PB N="313" REF="344">
began to conclude that the cu&s;tom of getting into the tubs and treading on the linen, either never had been practi&s;ed, or was come into di&s;u&s;e; but I had not waited more than half an hour, when many of them jumped into the tubs, without &s;hoes or &s;tockings, with their &s;hifts and petticoats drawn up far above the knees, and &s;tamped away with great compo|&s;ure in their countenances, and with all their &s;trength, no Scotchman taking the lea&s;t no-notice, or even looking towards them.</P>
<P>On conver&s;ing with &s;ome gentlemen of Gla&s;cow on this curious &s;ubject, they a&s;&s;ured me that the&s;e &s;ingular laundre&s;&s;es (as they ap|peared to me) were &s;trictly mode&s;t women, who only did what others of unblemi&s;hed repu|tation had been accu&s;tomed to for a long &s;eries of years; and added, that at any other time a pur&s;e of gold would not tempt them to draw the curtain &s;o high. By way of contra&s;t, let me ob&s;erve that many of our London &s;ervant-<HI>maids,</HI> though not always &s;o nice in other
<PB N="314" REF="345">
re&s;pects, would not be &s;een thus habited <HI>in public</HI> on any terms, le&s;t their precious cha|racters &s;hould be called in que&s;tion. A &s;trik|ing in&s;tance of the powerful influence of habit!</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the female &s;ervants in Edinburgh, Gla&s;cow, &amp;c do all their work, and run about the town the fore part of the day without &s;tays, &s;hoes or &s;tockings; and on Sundays I &s;aw the country-women going to Ward's Kirk, in the &s;ame manner (&s;tays excepted); however they do not go into kirk, till they have dre&s;&s;ed their legs and feet; but they &s;eat them&s;elves on the gra&s;s, &s;omewhere near, and put on their &s;hoes and &s;tockings, and garter up very deliberately. Mo&s;t of the&s;e poor young country-women go without any caps or hats; they have in ge|neral fine heads of hair, many plat it, others let it hang loo&s;e down their backs; and I a&s;&s;ure you, my friend, they look very agree|able.</P>
<P>I returned each time through Buxton, where
<PB N="315" REF="346">
&s;taying a week or two, I vi&s;ited Ca&s;tleton, and &s;pent &s;everal hours in exploring that &s;tupen|dous cavern, called The Devil's A&mdash; in the Peake. I al&s;o &s;urveyed Poole's Hole, near Buxton, and &s;pent &s;ome days in that truly romantic village, where we purcha&s;ed petri|factions, &amp;c.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DID not intend to trouble you or the pub|lic with an account of any more of my <HI>wonderful travels,</HI> but being now at Lyme,
<PB N="317" REF="348">
for want of other amu&s;ements this rainy morning, I thought that a &s;hort account of this journey might afford you &s;ome entertain|ment.</P>
<P>My &s;tate of health being but indifferent, and Mrs. Lackington's &s;till wor&s;e, I was in|duced to try what effect a journey would pro|duce; and it being immaterial what part I tra|velled to; as I had not for &s;o long a time &s;een my native place, and perhaps might not be fur|ni&s;hed with another opportunity, we re&s;olved to vi&s;it it. Accordingly in July la&s;t we &s;et out from Merton, which I now make my chief re&s;idence, taking Bath, Bri&s;tol, &amp;c. in our way to my native place Wellington.</P>
<P>In Bri&s;tol, Exbridge, Bridgewater, Taunton, Wellington, and other places, I amu&s;ed my|&s;elf in calling on &s;ome of my ma&s;ters, with whom I had about twenty years before work|ed as a journeyman &s;hoe-maker. I addre&s;&s;ed each with, <HI>"Pray Sir, have you got any oc|ca&s;ion?"</HI> which is the term made u&s;e of by
<PB N="318" REF="349">
journeymen in that u&s;eful occupation, when &s;eeking employment. Mo&s;t of tho&s;e hone&s;t men had quite forgot my per&s;on, as many of them had not &s;een me &s;ince I worked for them: &s;o that it is not ea&s;y for you to conceive with what &s;urprize and a&s;toni&s;hment they gazed on me. For you mu&s;t know that I had the vani|ty (I call it <HI>humour</HI>) to do this in my chariot, attended by my &s;ervants; and on telling them who I was, all appeared to be very happy to &s;ee me. And I a&s;&s;ure you, my friend, it afforded me much real plea&s;ure to &s;ee my old acquaintances alive and well.</P>
<P>At Taunton and Wellington it &s;eemed to be the unanimous determination of all the poorer &s;ort, that I &s;hould by no means be de|ficient in <HI>old acquaintance.</HI> Some poor &s;ouls declared that they had known me for <HI>fifty</HI> years (that is, years before I was born); others had danced me in their arms a thou|&s;and times; nay, better &s;till, &s;ome knew my grandmother; but, be&s;t of all, one old man
<PB N="319" REF="350">
claimed acquaintance with me, for having &s;een me many times on the top of a &s;ix-and-twenty round ladder, balanced on the chin of a merry andrew! The old man was however egregi|ou&s;ly mi&s;taken, as I never was &s;o precariou&s;ly exalted, my ambition, as you well know, tak|ing a very different turn. But that was of no con&s;equence: all the old fellow wanted was <HI>a &s;hilling</HI>&mdash;and I gave it him. No matter (as Sterne &s;ays) from what motive. I never ex|amine into the&s;e things. This I ob&s;erved, that <HI>&s;mall matters have made many happy,</HI> and I was &s;upremely &s;o, to be the means of con|tributing to their comfort. And indeed who would he&s;itate at being the means of diffu&s;ing happine&s;s on &s;uch ea&s;y terms, and with &s;o little trouble?</P>
<P>The bells rang merrily all the day of my arrival. I was al&s;o honoured with the atten|tion of many of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable people in and near Wellington and other parts: Some of whom were plea&s;ed to inform me, that the
<PB N="230" REF="351">
rea&s;on of their paying a particular attention to me was their having heard, and now having them&s;elves an opportunity of ob&s;erving, that I did not &s;o far forget my&s;elf, as many proud up&s;tarts had done; that the notice I took of my poor relations and old acquaintance merited the re&s;pect and approbation of every real gen|tleman. They were al&s;o plea&s;ed to expre&s;s a wi&s;h, that as &s;oon as I could di&s;po&s;e of my bu&s;ine&s;s, I would come down and &s;pend the remainder of my days among them.</P>
<P>William Jones, E&s;q. of Foxdowne, near Wellington, informed me of a remarkable <HI>progno&s;tication</HI> in my favour; He told me that when I was a boy, about twelve years of age, Mr. Paul, then a very con&s;iderable whole|&s;ale linen-draper, in Friday-&s;treet, London, (I believe &s;till living) pa&s;&s;ing by my father's hou&s;e, one day &s;topped at the door, and a&s;ked various que&s;tions about &s;ome guinea pigs which I had in a box. My an&s;wers it &s;eems plea&s;ed and &s;urprized him, and turning to|wards
<PB N="321" REF="352">
Mr. Jones, &s;aid, <HI>"Depend upon it, &s;ir, that boy will one day ri&s;e far above the &s;ituation that his pre&s;ent mean circum&s;tances &s;eem to pro|mi&s;e."</HI> So who knows what a great man I may yet be?</P>
<P>Give me leave to introduce another predic|tion, though not altogether &s;o plea&s;ing as that ju&s;t related. An Italian gentleman, by birth, was &s;ome years &s;ince looking at &s;ome books of <HI>palmi&s;try</HI> in my &s;hop, and at the &s;ame time was endeavouring to convince me of the reali|ity of that &s;cience. In the mid&s;t of his di&s;|cour&s;e, he &s;uddenly &s;eized my right hand, and on looking &s;ome time with great attention on the various lines, he informed me that I had twice been in danger, once by water and once by a wound in my head; he was very right, but I believe by chance, as I have many other times been in very great danger. He added, that I had much of the godde&s;s <HI>Venus</HI> in me, but much more of <HI>Mars</HI>; and he a&s;&s;ured me that I &s;hould go to the wars, and arrive at
<PB N="322" REF="353">
great honour. He likewi&s;e a&s;&s;ured me, that I &s;hould die by fire-arms pointed over a wall. &mdash;How far the former part of this gentle|man's prediction may be relied on, I will not pretend to decide, but the la&s;t part of it was lately very near coming to &s;uch a deci&s;ion as would have proved the fallibility of that part of his progno&s;tication, though even in that ca&s;e he might have pleaded his being pretty near the matter of fact, only &s;ub&s;tituting <HI>gun|powder</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>fire-arms,</HI> and I &s;hould not have had it in my power to contend the point with him. I will endeavour to render this intelligible: On Tue&s;day the fifth of July la&s;t, I very nearly e&s;caped being blown up with the powder-mills belonging to Mr. Bridges, at Ewell, near Merton in Surrey. A quarter of an hour before that event took place, I was riding out within one mile of the mills, and having enquired of Mr. Ro&s;s at Coom-Hou&s;e, for the way that leads round by the mills, I actually rode part of the way, with an in|tent
<PB N="323" REF="354">
of vi&s;iting them. But &s;ome how or other, I &s;carce knew why, I turned my hor&s;e about, and a few minutes after I had done &s;o, I &s;aw the fatal cata&s;trophe; which happening by day re&s;embled a large cloud of &s;moke, of a very light colour, and the report reached my ears &s;oon after. I immediately concluded, it could be nothing le&s;s than the powder-mills blown up; and on my return to my hou&s;e at Merton I &s;oon learnt that it was the identical powder-mills that in all probability I &s;hould have been in, or very near to, at the time of the explo|&s;ion. By this accident it &s;eems four men were killed, &s;ome of whom had large families. The bodies were &s;o much mangled by the explo&s;ion that they could not be di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other, and the head of one of them was thrown to a great di&s;tance.</P>
<P>But to proceed with my journey. I e&s;teem my&s;elf peculiarly happy, on one account in particular, that I undertook it; and have only to regret it did not take place &s;ooner, as it
<PB N="324" REF="355">
tended to undeceive me in a matter in which I had long been in an error. The ca&s;e was this: I had for &s;even years pa&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed that the parents of my fir&s;t wife were both dead; and on enquiring after them of Mr. Ca&s;h at Bridgwater, he confirmed the report. How|ever, as we pa&s;&s;ed through South Petherton, being but a mile from the place where they formely lived, I could not help &s;topping to find out the time when they died, and what other particulars I could learn relative to them, but to my very great &s;urprize, I was informed that they were both living at Newton, two miles di&s;tant. On this information I gave the coach|man orders to drive us there, but &s;till could &s;carcely credit that they really were alive.&mdash; But, O my dear Friend, it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible for me to de&s;cribe the &s;en&s;ations of Mrs. Lack|ington and my&s;elf, on entering the cottage which "with ragged wall of mold'ring mud" contained them! There we found&mdash;two poor
<PB N="325" REF="356">
"human ruins, tottering o'er the grave!"&mdash; The dim light on our entrance &s;eemed a little to fla&s;h in the &s;ocket, and every moment threatened to di&s;appear for ever.</P>
<P>While their "pale wither'd hands were &s;tretched out towards me, trembling at once with eagerne&s;s and age." I never before felt the full force of Shak&s;pear's de&s;cription,
<Q><L>"&mdash;La&s;t &s;cene of all</L>

<L>"Sans teeth, &s;ans eyes, &s;ans ta&s;te: &s;ans every thing."</L></Q>
from &s;uch a &s;tate of poverty and wretchedne&s;s, Good God, deliver me!</P>
<P>The old man is ninety years of age, and the good old woman eighty. The old man's in|tellects are much impaired; he for a moment knew me, and then his recollection for&s;ook him. The old woman retained her &s;en&s;es and knowledge during the whole of the time we were with them. On inquiry I found, that
<PB N="326" REF="357">
what little property they had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, had been all expended for &s;ome years.
<Q><L>"How many, once in Fortune's lap high fed,</L>
<L>"Solicit the cold hand of Charity!</L>
<L>"To &s;hock us more&mdash;&s;olicit it in vain!"</L>
<BIBL>Dr. Young.</BIBL></Q>
Amid&s;t this dreary &s;cene, it was &s;ome allevia|tion to learn that their pious &s;on had given them weekly as much as he could afford from his own little family, and I have added enough to render them as comfortable as their great age can po&s;&s;ibly admit of. But for your &s;ake and my own, I will drop this gloomy &s;ub|ject; which to me proved one of the mo&s;t affecting &s;cenes that ever I experienced during the whole cour&s;e of my life.</P>
<P>During our continuance at Wellington, I one morning rode over to Black Down, on purpo&s;e to in&s;pect an immen&s;e heap of &s;tones on the top of the hill, &s;trait before the town. The di&s;tance from Wellington is about two miles. Tho&s;e &s;tones cover about an acre of ground, and ri&s;e to a great height. The
<PB N="327" REF="358">
country people informed me with great gravity, that "the Devil brought them there in one night in his <HI>leathern apron."</HI> But the name of it, as well as the form, prove what it was. It Is called Symmon's <HI>Borough,</HI> or <HI>Barrow</HI>; which, you know, &s;ignifies a burial-place. I &s;hould not have taken any notice of it here, had I ever &s;een any Barrow of &s;tones be&s;ides this, and five other &s;maller Barrows, about half a mile from the large one. The country people informed me that the <HI>devil</HI> brought the five heaps in his <HI>glove.</HI> I al&s;o ob&s;erved the remains of a large camp near the &s;pot. Camden has taken notice of a large camp at Roach Ca&s;tle, three or four miles from hence; it is &s;trange that he &s;hould not take any no|tice of &s;o &s;ingular a Barrow as this certainly is.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEING now at one of tho&s;e places u&s;ually called <HI>watering-places,</HI> that is, a place where invalids re&s;ort in great numbers for the
<PB N="329" REF="360">
purpo&s;e of drinking the waters for which each particular &s;ituation is in repute, and bathing in them with a view to the re&s;toration of their health, I &s;hall trouble you with a few ob&s;er|vations which have occurred to me on the &s;ubject. I cannot entertain a doubt but many by &s;uch a practice have been highly benefited; but at the &s;ame time I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that &s;uch relief is only to be rea&s;onably expected where the parties po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;ufficient &s;hare of prudence to conform to &s;uch rules as are laid down to them by tho&s;e who are be&s;t acquainted with the nature of their &s;everal complaints, the &s;trength or weakne&s;s of their con&s;titutions, and the different virtues tho&s;e &s;everal waters po&s;&s;e&s;s, &s;o as properly to adapt them to each particular ca&s;e, and to drink the waters at proper &s;tated periods, as well as in proper do&s;es; be&s;ides conforming to &s;uch a regimen as &s;hall co-operate with them in producing the de&s;ired effect. But where invalids neglect all, or in|deed any of tho&s;e rules, is it not rather an
<PB N="330" REF="361">
ab&s;urdity to expect relief?&mdash;I will endeavour to explain my&s;elf:</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Waters either po&s;&s;e&s;s powerful vir|tues, or they do not. If they do, is it not ob|obvious that &s;ome judgment and caution is nece&s;&s;ary in the u&s;e of them? which mu&s;t either produce good or bad effects, according to the prudence with which they are applied. If on the other hand, they are of &s;o in&s;ignifi|cant a nature, that they may be u&s;ed at any time, and in any proportion without injury; and that too in di&s;orders and con&s;titutions very much varying from each other, then &s;urely the inference mu&s;t be, that no depend|ance is to be placed on them, and con&s;equent|ly it matters not if they are ever u&s;ed at all. For what purpo&s;e then do &s;uch numbers put them&s;elves to the inconvenience, expence, and trouble of travelling (frequently from di&s;tant parts of the kingdom), and that too, when many of them are in &s;o debilitated a &s;tate, that their very removal is attended with extreme
<PB N="331" REF="362">
danger, and &s;ometimes proves fatal? But that tho&s;e waters are not inactive, I am well con|vinced, having &s;een the bad effects ari&s;ing from the imprudent u&s;e of them, in many in|&s;tances, as well as the happy con&s;equences attending their being u&s;ed with due caution.</P>
<P>I was fir&s;t led into the&s;e reflections by having been highly diverted, when I vi&s;ited Buxton &s;everal &s;ummers, with the prepo&s;terous and ab&s;urd conduct of &s;ome of the company who re&s;orted thither for the purpo&s;e of re&s;tor|ing their health. I remember &s;ix or &s;even gentlemen informing me, that they were vio|lently afflicted with the gout and rheumati&s;m, and had undertaken this journey in hopes of receiving benefit by the waters. The&s;e gentle|men often rode or walked about the cold dreary hills, in very damp wet mornings, and after|wards drank claret from three o'clock in the afternoon to three the next morning: But I did not continue there long enough to be a witne&s;s of the happy effects which mu&s;t inevi|tably

<P>I al&s;o vi&s;ited Free&s;tone, near Bo&s;ton in Lin|coln&s;hire: to which place a number of trade&s;|men and farmers re&s;orted with their wives, in hopes of receiving benefit from the u&s;e of the &s;alt water, in a variety of complaints; which they had been advi&s;ed to do by the fa|culty, for a month, with particular directions to bathe every other day, and on the interme|diate days to drink half a pint of the water in the cour&s;e of that day. But the&s;e wi&s;e people on duly con&s;idering the matter, were fully convinced that this would detain them from their families and bu&s;ine&s;s longer than was al|together convenient; and al&s;o (which they &s;uppo&s;ed their medical friends never thought of) that they could bathe the full number of time$, $nd drink the pre&s;cribed quantity of the water, in a week or a fortnight at farthe&s;t, and thus not only expedite the cure, but likewi&s;e enable them to return to their families and

bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o much earlier, as well as &s;ave the nece&s;&s;ary expences attending their continuing for &s;uch a length of time at the watering place. The&s;e united con&s;iderations appeared to them &s;o con&s;i&s;tent with prudence and oeco|nomy, that they re&s;olved to put them into immediate practice. I remon&s;trated with &s;e|veral of the&s;e good people on the impropriety of their conduct; but whether they concluded I was a party intere&s;ted in detaining them on the &s;pot, or whether they deemed my judge|ment inferior to their own, I know not; but I ob&s;erved that &s;ome of them bathed &s;everal times in a day, and drank &s;alt water by the quart, the con&s;equence of which was, that they left the place when the time expired which they had pre&s;cribed to them&s;elves, much wor&s;e than they came. Some indeed were &s;o very weak, that I am per&s;uaded they could with difficulty reach their homes alive&punc; And in the&s;e ca&s;es the want of &s;ucce&s;s, in&s;tead of being attributed to the <HI>folly</HI> of the patients,
<PB N="334" REF="365">
is generally transferred to the <HI>waters,</HI> and to the want of judgment in tho&s;e who advi&s;ed the u&s;e of them.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you, my dear friend, this is pretty much the ca&s;e at Lyme. My rooms com|manding a view of the &s;ea, I have this and &s;everal other days noticed many decent looking men going down the beach three or four times in as many hours, and drinking a pint of wa|ter each time. I have made the &s;ame ob&s;erva|tion at <HI>Seaton, Charmouth</HI> and other places, &s;o that the ob&s;ervation of Crab&s;haw's nur&s;e in "the adventures of Sir Lancelot Greaves" have frequently occurred to me: "Ble&s;&s;ed be G&mdash; (&s;aid &s;he) my patient is in a fair way! his apozem has had a ble&s;&s;ed effect! five and twen|ty &s;tools &s;ince three o'clock in the morning!"</P>
<P>Relating the&s;e particulars to a medical friend, he informed me that &s;uch &s;pecimens of ignorance and ob&s;tinacy were by no means confined to the watering places; as he had in the cour&s;e of his practice met with repeated
<PB N="335" REF="366">
in&s;tances, where patients with a view of ha&s;t|ening the cure, and <HI>getting out of the doctor's hands</HI> (whom the vulgar <HI>charitably</HI> &s;uppo&s;e wi&s;h to retain them there as long as po&s;&s;ible) have &s;wallowed a half pint mixture intended for &s;everal do&s;es at once, and a whole box of pills in the &s;ame manner. The con&s;equences of which have been, that they have remain|ed <HI>in his hands</HI> a con&s;iderable time, &s;ome &s;o long as life (thus fooli&s;hly trifled with) la&s;ted.</P>
<P>But here are many of another cla&s;s; &s;ome of whom, though not <HI>all,</HI> came on purpo&s;e to bathe, but during the whole of their con|tinuance here, never found time to bathe once. The&s;e ha&s;ten to the billiard-room as &s;oon as they are out of their beds in the morn|ing, and there they continue until bed-time again. Some of the&s;e are indeed much bene|fited, being cured of <HI>con&s;umptions,</HI> while o|thers become proportionably much emaciated &mdash;<HI>in their pockets.</HI> And a great number, both of ladies and gentlemen devote the whole of
<PB N="336" REF="367">
their time to dre&s;&s;ing, eating, and playing at whi&s;t. Charming <HI>exerci&s;e</HI> it mu&s;t be! as they frequently &s;it &s;till in their chairs, for eight or ten hours together.</P>
<P>Here are others again, who, like the gen|tlemen at Buxton, &s;it drinking until three or four in the morning; making a delightful noi&s;e, to <HI>compo&s;e</HI> tho&s;e in the &s;ame hou&s;e who are real <HI>invalids,</HI> and who de&s;irous of obtaining re&s;t, retire early, though frequently to very little purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o ob&s;erved, that all the above places are as healthy for <HI>hor&s;es,</HI> as they are for their ma&s;ters. For as the innkeepers depend almo&s;t entirely on the &s;ea&s;on, they take great care, and do all they can to make the&s;e places comfortable. So that if gentlemen who have fat, lazy, prancing hor&s;es, and want to reduce them in &s;ize and temper, he may be &s;ure to have it done in &s;ome of the inns and &s;tables at the various watering places: Where &s;uch <HI>hay</HI> is procured as mu&s;t infallibly an&s;wer the
<PB N="337" REF="368">
purpo&s;e even though they be allowed a double portion of Corn.</P>
<P>There is yet another very great advantage (which I had like to have forgot) re&s;ulting from attending the watering places. Such gen|tlemen who happen to have &s;ervants too hone&s;t, too indu&s;trious, too attentive, too cleanly, too humble, too &s;ober, &amp;c. by taking them to any of the&s;e places where they have &s;o much lei&s;ure time, and where the&s;e party-coloured gentry meet together &s;o often, and in &s;uch numbers, no one can go away unimprov|ed, except he is a very dull fellow indeed. &mdash;This is not merely my own ob&s;ervation: for &s;everal gentlemen of my acquaintance a&s;|&s;ured me that they had always found their &s;ervants improved prodigiou&s;ly after all the&s;e excur&s;ions.</P>
<P>We purpo&s;e &s;etting out for Weymouth in a day or two: but as I intend that this &s;hall be my la&s;t epi&s;tle, I will not conclude it until I arrive at Merton.</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="369"><HI>Merton,</HI> Sep. 11th. We arrived here &s;afe la&s;t night, being my birth-day. At Weymouth we had the honour of walking &s;everal even|ings on the E&s;planade, with their maje&s;ties and the four prince&s;&s;es. His maje&s;ty &s;eems in per|fect health and &s;pirits, and diffu&s;es life and &s;pirits to all around him. Long, very long may he continue to enjoy the &s;ame degree of health and happine&s;s! But I could not help pitying Mr. Hughes, the manager of the The|atre there; as the company in general &s;eem to pay but very little attention to plays, while they can partake of the plea&s;ure of walking and breathing the &s;ea air with &s;o many of the royal family. But his maje&s;ty, who&s;e, huma|nity is by no means the lea&s;t of his many vir|tues, will no doubt con&s;ider Mr. Hughes, who is indu&s;trious to an extreme, as he is &s;carce a moment idle. For be&s;ides managing his company, performing him&s;elf &s;ix, &s;ometimes eight characters in a week, he paints all his own &s;cenes, and attends to many other &s;ub|jects;
<PB N="339" REF="370">
and although he has had a large expen|&s;ive family (nine children), the theatre there, and that al&s;o at Exeter is his own. Weymouth theatre he rebuilt about four years &s;ince; eve|ry thing is very neat; his &s;cenes are fine, and his company a very good one. I &s;aw them perform four pieces with a deal of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>In our road home, within half a mile of Dorche&s;ter, we &s;topt and &s;pent half an hour in looking round the famous Roman Amphi|theatre. It is clo&s;e to the road, on the right hand &s;ide, and covers about an acre of ground. It is judged that ten thou&s;and people might without interruption have beheld &s;uch exer|ci&s;es as were exhibited in this &s;chool of the ancients; it is called Mambury, and is &s;up|po&s;ed to be the compleate&s;t antiquity of the kind in England.</P>
<P>I al&s;o amu&s;ed my&s;elf, as I travelled through Dor&s;et&s;hire and Wilt&s;hire, in &s;urveying many of the numerous camps, fortifications, and barrows; which la&s;ting monuments of anti|quity
<PB N="340" REF="371">
are to be &s;een in abundance in the&s;e counties, a great number of them remain in a perfect &s;tate.</P>
<P>Nor could I any longer omit the opportu|nity of &s;eeing that &s;tupendous piece of anti|quity on Sali&s;bury plain, the famous <HI>Stone|henge,</HI> two miles from Ame&s;bury. We &s;pent near two hours there in a&s;toni&s;hment; and had not night came on, we &s;hould not have been able to have parted from it &s;o &s;oon. We found a very good inn at Ame&s;bury, which proves very convenient to &s;uch as curio&s;ity may detain on this wonderful &s;pot until it is late. It is remarkable, that although &s;o many able antiquaries have devoted their time and attention to the inve&s;tigation of Stonehenge, it remains &s;till a matter undecided when and for what purpo&s;e this amazing pile was formed; nor is there le&s;s cau&s;e of admiration, how &s;tones of &s;uch magnitude were brought hither! I &s;hall not pre&s;ume, either to decide on this curious point, or offer any conjectures of my own.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="372">I have now, Sir, not only given you &s;ome of the mo&s;t material circum&s;tances of my life, but have al&s;o &s;uper-added a &s;hort &s;ketch of &s;ome of my <HI>travels.</HI> And &s;hould the fine air of Merton pre&s;erve the &s;tock of health and &s;pirits which I have acquired in this la&s;t excur&s;ion, I intend to &s;pend a few hours in the middle of three or four days in every week in Chi&s;well-&s;treet, during the remainder of the &s;ummer; and during the winter I pur|po&s;e &s;pending mo&s;t of my time there: where I hope again to enjoy the company of you, Sir, and &s;ome others of our old philo&s;ophical friends.

<P><HI>P. S.</HI> I &s;hould deem my&s;elf deficient in point of ju&s;tice to the ingenious arti&s;t who painted the portrait from whence the engrav|ing affixed as a frontispiece to this volume is taken, if I did not embrace this opportunity of acknowledging the approbation it has been

<P>Before the portrait was fini&s;hed, Mrs. L. called on the painter to view it.
