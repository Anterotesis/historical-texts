<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE following traiterous <HI>Epi&s;tle</HI> from his Holine&s;s to the Reverend Doctor in the Title Page, was no le&s;s &s;urprizingly than happily inter|cepted by the Ma&s;ter of a &s;mall <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el not far off from the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Coa&s;t. The Manner and Circum&s;tances of it will, I doubt not, in due time, be communicated to the Publick by Authority: So that it &s;hall be my Bu&s;ine&s;s at pre&s;ent only to inform the World how it came into my Hands, and for what Rea&s;ons I make &s;o Seditious a Libel pub|lick. It was tran&s;mitted to me by one of His Maje&s;ty's Principal Secretaries of State, to whom it was delivered when fir&s;t taken, with Leave to make what u&s;e of it I &s;hould judge be&s;t for the
<PB REF="3">
Intere&s;t of the Nation. I thought that if it were publi&s;h'd, it would &s;tand for an unque&s;tionable Te&s;timony of the clo&s;e Conjunction of the Parti|zans at <HI>Rome</HI> to &s;ome among&s;t us in <HI>England;</HI> and that it would particularly &s;erve for a Clue to the pre&s;ent Controver&s;y. The&s;e were the Rea&s;ons which chiefly induc'd me to publi&s;h it. The Ori|ginal is in <HI>Latin</HI> Hexameter Ver&s;e; but for &s;everal Political Rea&s;ons, which &s;hall remain &s;ecret, as well as becau&s;e it would be otherwi&s;e very unpo|pular, I have been at the trouble of tran&s;lating it, as well as I could with &s;ufficient Expedition, into <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> The Original is indeed admirably fine, and di&s;covers through almo&s;t every Line of it the Marks of a more than ordinary In&s;piration: But in the Tran&s;lation, my main De&s;ign in it being to ex|po&s;e the Enemies of our happy E&s;tabli&s;hment in Church and State to the mo&s;t vulgar Eye, I have had Regard rather to the Matter of it, than to tho&s;e numerous, unu&s;ual Flights and Delicacies of Poetry, with which an Imagination, profe&s;&s;edly Infallible, and therefore more than Humane, mu&s;t naturally abound.</P>
<P>I know very well, that the Doctor will &s;tifly de|ny any &s;uch Corre&s;pondence, &s;olemnly declare this Epi&s;tle to be maliciou&s;ly forged again&s;t him,
<PB REF="4">
and endeavour to extricate Him&s;elf from the Con|&s;equences of it, by amu&s;ing the World with <HI>an Account</HI> of his <HI>Loyalty,</HI> and Aver&s;ene&s;s to <HI>Popery,</HI> &s;upported by <HI>ample Te&s;timonies of Gentlemen, Clergy, and others;</HI> and perhaps even <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> Them&s;elves: But I do hereby before-hand advi&s;e him to get &s;uch <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> &s;uch <HI>Clergy,</HI> and &s;uch <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> in his behalf, as &s;tand in the Eye of the World un|&s;u&s;pected of any the like Practices and De&s;igns with him&s;elf. The Fact is openly produced again&s;t him; and Facts are, he knows very well, <HI>&s;tubborn, unmanageable Things.</HI> If what I have already &s;aid will not convince him, and the World, that this Piece is Genuine, what I have farther to propo&s;e, <HI>mu&s;t.</HI> If then he be really curious to know whether Ju&s;|tice be done him in this Matter, and de&s;ires a ful|ler Satisfaction in it, and if he will acquaint my Book&s;eller therewith, he &s;hall meet me at any proper Place, which he &s;hall appoint, and &s;ee the <HI>Latin</HI> Original in his Holine&s;s's own Hand-writing: <HI>Provided</HI> (which I think very fair) he will bring along with him the genuine, original Copy of <HI>Mr. Pillonniere</HI>'s Letter to the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> which He publi&s;h'd in his <HI>Vindication.</HI></P>
<P>Having made this generous Propo&s;al to remove all manner of Doubts, I will however for once &s;up|po&s;e
<PB REF="5">
it not to be (what I have proved it to be) genuine; I will &s;uppo&s;e it forged purpo&s;ely to re|flect on the Doctor, and yet, I am per&s;uaded, the impartial World would notwith&s;tanding acquit me of the Scandal: For if the Doctor's own late Anti-chri&s;tian Attempts utterly to ruin the good Name of two innocent Per&s;ons (a pious Bi&s;hop, and a learn|ed and valuable Fugitive, from the Ab&s;urdities and Cruelties of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church) will not &s;uf|ficiently ju&s;tify a Satyrical Cha&s;ti&s;ement; then Re|bellion, and Athei&s;m it &s;elf, Murder, Rapine, Drunkenne&s;s, Debauchery, and all the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Wickedne&s;&s;es in the World, ought for the &s;ame Rea&s;on to go unpuni&s;hed and uncondemn'd. His in&s;olent Behaviour towards the Bi&s;hop; and his unnatural, barbarous Treatment of a &s;incere Con|vert to the Religion which he <HI>profe&s;&s;es,</HI> who had given him no Provocation, is, I may &s;afely &s;ay, unparallel'd as well as unju&s;tifiable. His own heartie&s;t Well-wi&s;hers, and the heartie&s;t Well-wi&s;hers to that Cau&s;e which he has undertaken, mu&s;t, whether they will or no, in this Ca&s;e, una|nimou&s;ly abhor &s;uch Proceedings in their Hearts, tho' they care not openly to avow it, for fear of di&s;countenancing the great <HI>Achilles</HI> of their Party, and le&s;&s;ening the Intere&s;t which he is &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly
<PB REF="6">
&s;erving: For let the mo&s;t partial, the mo&s;t bigot|ted and intere&s;ted Man upon Earth look back, if he can, upon this long, continued Series of Ini|quity, without at lea&s;t a tacit, con&s;cientious In|dignation; Let him behold it fir&s;t beginning in the Heat and Hurry of Pa&s;&s;ion, by a ra&s;h A&s;&s;ertion, which this Reverend Divine, embara&s;s'd on all &s;ides with Difficulties, made at random without any Proof, or any po&s;&s;ible well-grounded Hopes of Proof, and again&s;t the Light and inward Con|viction of his own Mind: Let him behold it carried on by the &s;ame wicked, unaccountable Me|thods of Revenge, and blind Fury; and at la&s;t, when nothing el&s;e could be done, confirm'd by the Evidence of a <HI>profligate, perjur'd</HI> Wretch, confe&s;|&s;ed &s;o on both &s;ides, an <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Knight of the Po&s;t,</HI> who was re&s;olved to turn a Penny in this Af|fair, and &s;wear for him that Paid be&s;t. I &s;ay, the mo&s;t prejudic'd of all Men, if he has yet any Re|mains of Tenderne&s;s left, if he has but one poor Spark of Humanity unextingui&s;h'd in his Brea&s;t, if he calls him&s;elf a Man or a Chri&s;tian, will make the Ca&s;e of this <HI>unhappy Stranger</HI> his own, and &s;hare in all the Bitterne&s;s and Severity of his Enemies. For my own Part, I do indeed think my &s;elf at Liberty to per&s;i&s;t in the Defen&s;e of <HI>Innocence</HI> and
<PB REF="7">
<HI>Virtue,</HI> and to animadvert on the different Cha|racters of <HI>Vice,</HI> in what&s;oever <HI>&s;anctified Shapes</HI> it &s;hall make its Appearance, and under what&s;oever popular Di&s;gui&s;es it &s;hall in&s;inuate it&s;elf into the Pa&s;&s;ions of the unthinking or de&s;igning Part of Mankind. I am re&s;olved, upon all Occa&s;ions, as far as I am able, to detect and expo&s;e the &s;candalous Artifices of an enraged, di&s;appointed and revenge|ful <HI>Party:</HI> I am re&s;olved to vindicate the Reputa|tion of an innocent and eminently pious and learn|ed Bi&s;hop from the A&s;per&s;ions unde&s;ervedly thrown upon him by Per&s;ons who are under the greate&s;t Obligations to him for his excellent (I may &s;ay) unan&s;werable Writings in Defen&s;e of <HI>Prote&s;tanti&s;m</HI> in general, and of the <HI>Church of England</HI> in par|ticular; and who for that Rea&s;on ought, in&s;tead of the ungrateful Returns of Envy, Malice and Defamation, to join their Hands and their Hearts with him in the &s;ame Cau&s;e, again&s;t the Common Enemy. And this I &s;hall do, notwith&s;tanding all the hard Names and unju&s;t Imputations which I mu&s;t expect to meet with; notwith&s;tanding all the Enemies I &s;hall by this means rouze up again&s;t me, and (what with me weighs more than every thing el&s;e put together) notwith&s;tanding it &s;hould prove di&s;gu&s;tful to the very Man for who&s;e Service it is
<PB REF="8">
intended: for that the Bi&s;hop is unwilling any of his Adver&s;aries &s;hould experience any Severities upon his Account, he has often told us, and that he di&s;|approves &s;uch Methods of Controver&s;y equally on both &s;ides: And this is the only thing in which I could prevail with my&s;elf to give him any Pain and Unea&s;ine&s;s. But &s;hall a peaceable, good-natur'd Man be torn to Pieces, meerly becau&s;e he is &s;o? Shall the be&s;t inward Di&s;po&s;ition, and the mo&s;t candid outward Behaviour meet with nothing but Affronts and In&s;olences? And &s;hall it become unju&s;t to u&s;e Men in the &s;ame manner, that they u&s;e others? No, no: For tho' they have found it impo&s;&s;ible to provoke his Lord&s;hip to any indecent Returns of ill Treatment, and therefore are continually railing and reviling without any Fears of the like U&s;age from him; they mu&s;t however expect, that the Spectators of their Behaviour will ri&s;e up in De|fen&s;e of Mode&s;ty, Virtue and Good-nature, and re|buke the <HI>proud and haughty Scorner, who dealeth in proud Wrath.</HI> The&s;e &s;ort of Men indeed have been &s;o long u&s;ed to receive Argument and Rea&s;on in return for <HI>Billing&s;gate</HI> and Impudence; Pity and Forgive|ne&s;s, for Injuries and Abu&s;es; Civility, for Reproach; and in &s;hort, the be&s;t Treatment for the wor&s;t; that they &s;eem at length to e&s;teem it a Privilege belonging
<PB REF="9">
peculiarly to them&s;elves; and will in time, if not check'd in their Arrogance, plead for it by Pre|&s;cription and Charter.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with a&s;&s;uring the Doctor, that when he &s;hall think fit to de&s;i&s;t from his In|&s;ults on Innocence and Merit, I will de&s;i&s;t from (what he may call, if he plea&s;es) in&s;ulting him; and that I will &s;till follow his Example, whether he be inclin'd to Peace or War. And this is what I thought proper to &s;ay as the Publi&s;her of the fol|lowing Poem; and &s;o I take my leave.</P>
