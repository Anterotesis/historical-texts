<HEAD>THE LIFE OF T. SMOLLETT. M. D.</HEAD>
<P>DR. Tobias Smollett, an author who&s;e writings will tran&s;mit his name with honour to po&s;te|rity, and who&s;e virtues as a man de&s;erve to be com|memorated, was born about the year 1720 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Travels through France and Italy, Vol. I. p. 177; he &s;peaks of his age in the year 1763, thus: <Q>&startq;Annum aetatis po&s;t qua|drage&s;imum tertium.&endq;</Q></NOTE>, at a &s;mall village, within two miles of Cameron, on the banks of the river Leven <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Humphry Clinker, Vol. III. p. 41&punc;</NOTE>. He appears to have received a cla&s;&s;ical education, and was bred to the practice of phy&s;ic and &s;urgery. It is a trite remark, that the lives of authors are little more than an enu|meration and account of their works; they are ge|nerally &s;o deficient in incident, that, after a com|pleat catalogue of their writings is produced, nothing more can be added, except the times of their births
<PB N="ii" REF="40">
and deaths. If fame is in the lea&s;t to be depended upon, this ob&s;ervation will not apply to Dr. Smollett. It is &s;aid, and probably with &s;ome truth, that the chief incidents in the early part of his life were given to the public in one of the fir&s;t and be&s;t of his pro|ductions, the novel of Roderick Random; however, whether that report is well founded or not, certain it is that he was at the &s;iege of Carthagena in the capacity of a &s;urgeon, or &s;urgeon's mate, and in the before-mentioned novel has given a faithful, though no very plea&s;ing, account of the manage|ment of that ill-conducted expedition which he cen&s;ures in the warme&s;t terms, and from circum|&s;tances which fell under his own particular ob&s;erva|tion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Smollett is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the editor of <Q>&startq;A Com|pendium of authentic Voyages, dige&s;ted in a Chronological Series,&endq;</Q> 7 vol. 12mo&punc; publi&s;hed in 1756; among&s;t which is in&s;erted a &s;hort narrative of the expedition to Carthagena, 1741; written with great &s;pirit, but abounding with too much acrimony. This narrative we conceive to be a production written by the &s;uppo&s;ed editor.</NOTE>. His connection with the &s;ea &s;eems not to have had a long continuance, and it is probable that he wrote &s;everal pieces before he became known to the public by his capital productions. The fir&s;t piece we know of with certainty is a Satire in two parts, printed fir&s;t in the year 1746 and 1747,
<PB N="iii" REF="50">
and now reprinted in this collection of his poetical pieces <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See p. 203.&mdash;About this period, or &s;ome time before, he wrote for Mr. Rich an opera, intitled Alce&s;te, which has never been performed nor printed. The mu&s;ic to it was compo&s;ed by Mr. Han|del, who finding that no u&s;e was intended to be made of it, after|wards adapted it to Mr. Dryden's le&s;&s;er Ode for Saint Cecilia's Day&punc; <HI>Hawkins's Hi&s;tory of Mu&s;ic,</HI> Vol. I. p. 28. Vol. V. p. 324.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Very early in life (at the age of eighteen) he wrote a tragedy intitled The Regicide, founded on the &s;tory of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of James I. of Scot|land. In the Preface to the publication of this piece, by &s;ub&s;cription in the year 1749, he bitterly exclaimed again&s;t fal&s;e patrons, and the duplicity of theatrical managers. The warmth and impetuo&s;ity of his temper hurried him on this occa&s;ion into unju&s;t reflections again&s;t the late Lord Lyttelton, and Mr. David Garrick; the character of the former he &s;atirifed in his novel of Peregrine Pickle, and he added a burle&s;que of the monody written by that nobleman on the death of his Lady. Again&s;t Mr. Garrick he made illiberal ill-founded critici&s;ms, and in his novel of Roderick Random, gave a very un|fair repre&s;entation of his treatment of him re&s;pect|ing this tragedy. Of this conduct he afterwards re|pented and acknowledged his errors, though in the &s;ub&s;equent editions of the novel, the pa&s;&s;ages which
<PB N="iv" REF="60">
were the ha&s;ty effu&s;ions of di&s;appointment, are not as we think they &s;hould have been omitted. De|&s;irous, however, of <Q>&startq;doing ju&s;tice in a work of truth for wrongs done in a work of fiction&endq;</Q> (to u&s;e his own expre&s;&s;ion) in giving a &s;ketch of the liberal arts in his Hi&s;tory of England, he remarked, <Q>&startq;&endq;the exhi|bitions of the &s;tage were improved to the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite entertainment by the talents and ma|nagement of Garrick, who greatly &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all his predece&s;&s;ors of this and perhaps every other nation in his genius for acting, in the &s;weetne&s;s and variety of his tones, the irre&s;i&s;tible magic of his eye, the fire and vivacity of his action, the elegance of attitude, and the whole pathos of expre&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<Q>&startq;Candidates for literary fame appeared even in the higher &s;phere of life embelli&s;hed by the ner|vous &s;en&s;e and exten&s;ive erudition of a Corke, by the delicate ta&s;te, the poli&s;hed mu&s;e, and tender feelings of a Lyttelton.&endq;</Q>
<P>Not &s;atisfied with this <HI>public</HI> declaration of his &s;entiments, he wrote in &s;till &s;tronger terms to Mr. Garrick;</P>

<P>In the year 1757, Dr. Smollett's Comedy of the Repri&s;als, an after-piece of two acts, was performed at Drury-lane theatre. He acknowledged him&s;elf

The imputation is altogether fal&s;e and malicious. Exclu&s;ive of other con&s;iderations, I could not be &s;uch an ideot to talk in that &s;train when my own intere&s;t &s;o immediately required a different &s;ort of conduct.

<P>In the year 1748 he publi&s;hed his novel of Ro|derick Random, a book which &s;till continues to have a mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;ale, and fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed the Doctor's reputation. All the fir&s;t volume, and the beginning of the &s;econd, appear to con&s;i&s;t of real incident and character, though certainly a good deal heightened and di&s;gui&s;ed. The judge, his grandfather, Crab and Potion, the two apotheca|ries, and 'Squire Gawkey, were characters well known in that part of the kingdom where the &s;cene was laid. Captains Oakhum and Whiffle, Doc|tors Mack&s;hane and Morgan, were al&s;o &s;aid to be real per&s;onages; but their names we have either ne|ver learned, or have now forgotten. A bookbinder
<PB N="iii" REF="100">
and barber long eagerly contended for being &s;hadow|ed under the name of Strap. The Doctor &s;eems to have enjoyed a peculiar felicity in de&s;cribing &s;ea characters, particularly the officers and &s;ailors of the navy. His Trunnion, Hatchway, and Pipes, are highly-fini&s;hed originals; but what exceeds them all, and perhaps equals any character that has yet been painted by the happie&s;t genius of ancient or modern times, is his Lieutenant Bowling. This is indeed nature it&s;elf; original, <HI>unique,</HI> and <HI>&s;ui generis.</HI> As well as the ladder of promotion, his very name has long become proverbial for an hone&s;t blunt &s;ea|man, unacquainted with mankind and the ways of the world.</P>
<P>By the publication of that work the Doctor had acquired &s;o great a reputation, that henceforth a certain degree of &s;ucce&s;s was in&s;ured to every thing known or &s;u&s;pected to proceed from his hand. In the cour&s;e of a few years the adventures of Pe|regrine Pickle appeared <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1751.</NOTE>; a work of great inge|nuity and and contrivance in the compo&s;ition, and in which an uncommon degree of erudition is di&s;|played, particularly in the de&s;cription of the enter|tainment given by the Republican Doctor, after the manner of the ancients. Under this per&s;onage the late Dr. Aken&s;ide, author of a famous poem, in|titled, The Plea&s;ures of the Imagination, is &s;up|po&s;ed
<PB N="ix" REF="110">
to be typified; and it would be difficult to de|termine whether profound learning or genuine hu|mour predominate mo&s;t in this epi&s;ode. Butler and Smollett &s;eem to be the only two who have united things, &s;eemingly &s;o di&s;cordant, happily together; for Hudibras is one of the mo&s;t learned works in any language; and it requires no common &s;hare of reading, a&s;&s;i&s;ted with a good memory, thoroughly to reli&s;h and under&s;tand it. Another epi&s;ode of The Adventures of a Lady of Quality, likewi&s;e in&s;erted in this work, contributed greatly to its &s;ucce&s;s, and is indeed admirably well executed. Yet, after giv|ing all due prai&s;e to the merit and invention di&s;|played in Peregrine Pickle, we cannot help think|ing it is inferior, in what may be called <HI>na&iuml;vet&eacute;,</HI> a a thing better conceived than expre&s;&s;ed, to Rode|rick Random.</P>
<P>The&s;e were not the only original compo&s;itions of this &s;tamp with which the Doctor has favoured the public. Ferdinand Count Fathom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Publi&s;hed in the year 1754.</NOTE> and Sir Launcelot Greaves <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fir&s;t printed in the Briti&s;h Magazine, and afterwards in 2 vols. 12mo, 1762.</NOTE>, are &s;till in the li&s;t of what may be called reading novels; but there is no inju&s;tice in placing them in a rank far below the former. No doubt invention, character, compo&s;ition, and contrivance, are to be found in both; but then &s;ituations are de|&s;cribed
<PB N="x" REF="120">
which are hardly po&s;&s;ible, and characters are painted, which, if not altogether unexampled, are at lea&s;t incompatable with modern manners; and which ought not to be, as the &s;cenes are laid in mo|dern times.</P>
<P>The la&s;t work which the Doctor publi&s;hed, was of much the &s;ame &s;pecies, but ca&s;t into a different form&mdash;The Expedition of Humphry Clinker <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Printed in 3 vols. 1771.</NOTE>. It con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;eries of letters, written by different per&s;ons to their re&s;pective corre&s;pondents. He has here carefully avoided the faults which may be ju&s;tly charged to his two former productions. Here are no extravagant characters, nor unnatural &s;ituations. On the contrary, an admirable knowledge of life and manners is di&s;played; and mo&s;t u&s;eful le&s;&s;ons are given applicable to intere&s;ting, but to very common &s;itu|ations.</P>
<P>We know not that ever the remark has been made, but there is certainly a very obvious &s;imilitude be|tween the characters of the three heroes of the Doctor's chief productions. Roderick Random, Peregrine Pickle, and Matthew Bramble, are all brothers of the &s;ame family. The &s;ame &s;atirical, cynical di&s;po&s;ition, the &s;ame genero&s;ity and bene|volence, are the di&s;tingui&s;hing and characteri&s;tical
<PB N="xi" REF="130">
features of all three; but they are far from being &s;ervile copies or imitations of each other. They differ as much as the Ajax, Diomed, and Achilles of Homer. This was undoubtedly a great effort of genius; and the Doctor &s;eems to have de&s;cribed his own character at the different &s;tages and &s;ituations of his life.</P>
<P>Before he took a hou&s;e at Chel&s;ea, he attempted to &s;ettle as practitioner of phy&s;ic at Bath; and, with that view, wrote a treati&s;e on the waters <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Intitled, <Q>&startq;An E&s;&s;ay on the external U&s;e of Water, in a Letter to Dr.&mdash;, with particular Remarks upon the pre&s;ent Method of u&s;ing the Mineral Waters at Bath, in Somer&s;et&s;hire, and a Plan for rendering them more &s;afe, agreeable, and efficacious.&endq;</Q> Quarto. 1752.</NOTE>; but was un&s;ucce&s;sful, chiefly becau&s;e he could not render him&s;elf agreeable to the women, who&s;e favour is certainly of great con&s;equence to all candidates for eminence, whether in medicine or divinity. This, however, was a little extraordinary; for tho&s;e who remembered Dr. Smollett at that time, cannot but acknowledge that he was as graceful and hand&s;ome a man as any of the age he lived in; be|&s;ides, there was a certain dignity in his air and man|ner which could not but in&s;pire re&s;pect wherever he appeared. Perhaps he was too &s;oon di&s;couraged; in all probability, had he per&s;evered, a man of his
<PB N="xii" REF="140">
great learning, profound &s;agacity, and inten&s;e ap|plication, be&s;ides being endued with every other external as well as internal accompli&s;hment, mu&s;t have at la&s;t &s;ucceeded, and, had he attained to com|mon old age, been at the head of his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Abandoning phy&s;ic altogether as a profe&s;&s;ion, he fixed his re&s;idence at Chel&s;ea, and turned his thoughts entirely to writing. Yet, as an author, he was not near &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful as his happy genius and acknowledged merit certainly de&s;erved. He never acquired a p$tron among the great, who, by his favour or beneficence, relieved him from the nece&s;&s;ity of writing for a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The truth is, Dr. Smollett po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a loftine&s;s and elevation of &s;entiment and character which appears to have di&s;|qualified him from currying favour among tho&s;e who were able to confer favours. It would be wrong to call this di&s;po&s;ition of his, pride or haugh|tine&s;s; for to his equals and inferiors he was ever polite, friendly, and generous. Book&s;ellers may therefore be &s;aid to have been his only patrons; and from them he had con&s;tant employment in tran&s;lating, compiling, and reviewing. He tran&s;|lated Gil Blas and Don Quixote <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Printed in 4to. 2 vols. 1755. Since his death a tran&s;lation of Telemachus has al&s;e appeared.</NOTE>, both &s;o happily, that all the former tran&s;lations of the&s;e excellent
<PB N="xiii" REF="150">
productions of genius are in a fair way of being &s;u|per&s;eded by his. His name likewi&s;e appears to a tran&s;lation of Voltaire's pro&s;e works, but little of it was done by his own hand; he only revi&s;ed it, and added a few notes. He was concerned in great va|riety of compilations. His Hi&s;tory of England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fir&s;t printed in 4 vols. 4to&punc; 1757.</NOTE> was the principal work of that kind. It has in it&s;elf real intrin&s;ic merit; but, con&s;idering the time and circum&s;tances in which it was written, it is indeed a prodigy of genius, and a great effort of application. It had a mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;ale, and the Doctor is &s;aid to received &pound; 2000, for writing it and the Continua|tion. He was employed, during the la&s;t years of his life, in preparing a new edition of the Ancient and Modern Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory, great part of which he had originally written him&s;elf, particularly the Hi&s;tories of France, Italy, and Germany. He lived nearly to compleat this work, and it is &s;aid it will &s;oon be publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>In the year 1755 he &s;et on foot the Critical Re|view, and continued the principal manager of it, till he went abroad for the fir&s;t time in the year 1763. To &s;peak impartially, he was, perhaps, too acrimonious &s;ometimes in the conduct of that work, and at the &s;ame time too &s;ore, and di&s;played too much &s;en&s;ibility when any of the unfortunate au|thors
<PB N="xiv" REF="160">
who&s;e works he had, it may be, ju&s;tly cen|&s;ured, attempted to retaliate.</P>
<P>Among other controver&s;ies which his engage|ments in this publication involved him, the mo&s;t material in its con&s;equences was that which was oc|ca&s;ioned by his remarks on a pamphlet publi&s;hed by Admiral Knowles. That gentleman, in defence of his conduct, on the expedition to Rochfort, pub|li&s;hed a vindication of him&s;elf, which falling under the Doctor's examination, produced &s;ome very &s;e|vere &s;trictures both on the performance as well as on the character of the writer of it. The Admiral immediately commenced a pro&s;ecution again&s;t the printer; declaring, at the &s;ame time, that he de|&s;ired only to be informed who the writer was, that, if he proved to be a gentleman, he might obtain the &s;atisfaction of one from him. In this affair the Doctor behaved both with prudence and with &s;pirit. De&s;irous of compromi&s;ing the di&s;pute with the Ad|miral in an amicable manner, he applied to his friend Mr. Wilkes, to interpo&s;e his good offices with his opponent, in the following letter:</P>

<P>The Admiral continued inflexible; and ju&s;t as &s;entence was going to be pronounced again&s;t the printer, the Doctor came into court, avowed him|&s;elf the author of the Strictures, and declared him|&s;elf ready to give Mr. Knowles any &s;atisfaction he cho&s;e. The Admiral immediately commenced a fre&s;h action again&s;t the Doctor, who was found guilty, fined &pound; 100, and condemned to three months impri&s;onment in the King's Bench.

<P>From the commencement of the Review, Dr. Smollett was always con&s;idered as the author of it: by this means he became frequently cen&s;ured on ac|count of articles in which he had no concern.

retorted with great &s;pirit in his excellent poem intituled An Apology to the Critical Reviewers, it appears however he was mi&s;taken in his &s;u&s;picion; for Dr. Smollett hearing that Mr. Colman had al&s;o accu&s;ed him of having made an attack on his moral character in the Review, the Doctor exculpated him|&s;elf from the charge, in a letter to Mr. G.</P>

I am old enough to have &s;een and ob&s;erved that we are all play-things of for|tune; and that it depends upon &s;omething as in|&s;ignificant and precarious as the to&s;&s;ing up of a halfpenny, whether a man ri&s;es to affluence and honours, or continues to his dying day &s;truggling with the difficulties and di&s;graces of life.

<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e many other di&s;putes aro&s;e with dif|ferent writers who con&s;idered them&s;elves injured by the &s;everity of the Doctor's critici&s;ms; indeed it may be affirmed that &s;eldom a month pa&s;&s;ed with|out a complaint on that head, and tho&s;e not often couched in the mo&s;t decent terms. But whatever rea&s;on he had to complain on that account, he &s;oon after found that the revenge of an author was nothing compared to the rancour of the politician. In the year 1762 Lord Bute took the reins of go|vernment into his hands. His promotion was at|tended with many unpopular mea&s;ures, great di&s;&s;a|tisfaction aro&s;e among&s;t many orders of men, and his lord&s;hip found it nece&s;&s;ary to employ &s;ome able writers to palliate and defend the &s;teps which had led to his advancement. Among&s;t others Dr. Smollett was pitched upon, and he entered on the ta&s;k ap|pointed for him with great &s;pirit. In defence of his patron he immediately began a weekly paper which he called The Briton. The fir&s;t number made its appearance on the 29th of May, 1762, and was immediately followed by the publication of the North Briton, which in the end entirely routed

The Briton continued to be publi&s;hed until the 12th of Februrary, 1763, when it was laid down; and very &s;oon after the per&s;on, in who&s;e defence it was &s;et on foot, finding the &s;tream of popular di&s;content too &s;trong to be re|&s;i&s;ted, relinqui&s;hed the po&s;t which had excited &s;o much envy and clamour, and on his re&s;ignation it is &s;aid entirely neglected all the per&s;ons whom he
<PB N="xxi" REF="230">
had employed to write for him. Be&s;ides the Briton Dr. Smollet is &s;uppo&s;ed to have written other pieces in &s;upport of the cau&s;e he e&s;pou&s;ed. The Adven|tures of an Atom, in two volumes, are known to be his productions.</P>
<P>His con&s;titution being at la&s;t greatly impaired by a &s;edentary life, and a&s;&s;iduous application to &s;tudy, he went abroad for his health in the month of June 1763, and continued in France and Italy two years. He wrote an account of his travels in a &s;e|ries of letters to &s;ome friends, which were afterwards publi&s;hed in two volumes, octavo, 1766. During all that time he appears to have laboured under a con&s;tant fit of chagrin <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A very &s;light peru&s;al of the&s;e letters will &s;ufficiently evince that this ob&s;ervation is founded in fact, and is indeed a melancholy in|&s;tance of the influence of bodily di&s;temper over the be&s;t di&s;po&s;ition. To this cynical relation of his Travels Mr. Sterne is &s;uppo&s;ed to al|lude, in the following pa&s;&s;age of his Sentimental Journey, vol. I. p. 86. <Q>&startq;&endq;The learned Smelfungus travelled from Bologne to Paris&mdash;from Paris to Rome&mdash;and &s;o on&mdash;but he &s;et out with the &s;pleen and jaundice, and every object he pa&s;&s;ed by was di&s;coloured and di&s;torted&mdash;He wrote an account of them, but it was nothing but the account of his mi&s;erable feelings.&mdash;I met Smelfungus in the grand portico of the Pantheon&mdash;he was ju&s;t coming out of it.</Q>&mdash;`It is nothing but a huge cockpit,' "&s;aid he."&mdash;<Q>&startq;I wi&s;h you had &s;aid nothing wor&s;e of the Venus of Medicis,&endq;</Q> <Q>&startq;replied I&mdash;for in pa&s;&s;ing through Florence I had heard he had fallen foul upon the godde&s;s, and u&s;ed her wor&s;e than a common &s;trumpet, without the lea&s;t provocation in nature.&mdash;I popped upon Smelfungus again at Tu|rin, in his return home, and a &s;ad tale of &s;orrowful adventures had he to tell, wherein he &s;poke of moving accidents by flood and field, and of the cannibals which each other eat: the Anthropo|phagi&mdash;He had been flayed alive, and bedeviled, and wor&s;e u&s;ed than St. Bartholomew, at every &s;tage he had come at.&mdash;`I'll tell it,' cried Smelfungus,&endq;</Q> `to the world.'&mdash;`You had better tell it,' "&s;aid I," `to your phy&s;ician.'</NOTE>. But the &s;tate of his mind
<PB N="xxii" REF="240">
will be be&s;t learned from him&s;elf. Thus he writes in his fir&s;t letter: <Q>&startq;In gratifying your curio&s;ity I &s;hall find &s;ome amu&s;ement to beguile the tedious hours; which without &s;ome &s;uch employment, would be rendered in&s;upportable by di&s;temper and di&s;quiet. You knew and pitied my &s;itua|tion, traduced by malice, per&s;ecuted by faction, abandoned by fal&s;e patrons, and overwhelmed by the &s;en&s;e of a dome&s;tic calamity, which it was not in the power of fortune to repair.&endq;</Q> By this do|me&s;tic calamity he means the lo&s;s of his only child, a daughter, whom he loved with the tendere&s;t af|fection. The Doctor, after his return to his native country, finding his health continuing to decline, and meeting with fre&s;h mortifications and di&s;appoint|ments, he went back to Italy, where he died on October the 21&s;t, 1771, and &s;ince his death a monu|ment hath been erected to his memory near Leghorn, on which is in&s;cribed the following epitaph written

<P>THE REGICIDE: OR, JAMES THE FIRST OF SCOTLAND; A TRAGEDY.</P>

<PB REF="340">
<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHATEVER reluctance I have to trouble the public, with a detail of the mortifica|tions I have &s;uffered, in my attempts to bring the en&s;uing performance on the &s;tage, I think it a duty incumbent upon me, to declare my rea&s;ons for pre|&s;enting it in this extraordinary manner; and, if the explanation &s;hall be found either tedious or trifling, I hope the candid reader will charge my impertinence upon tho&s;e who drove me to the nece&s;&s;ity of making &s;uch an ineffectual appeal.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, I flatter my&s;elf, that a fair repre&s;entation of the u&s;age I have met with, will be as a beacon, to caution other inexperienced authors again&s;t the in&s;incerity of managers, to which they might other|wi&s;e become egregious dupes; and, after a cajoling
<PB N="xxxvi" REF="350">
dream of good fortune, wake in all the aggravation of di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>Although I claim no merit from having fini&s;hed a Tragedy at the age of eighteen, I cannot help thinking my&s;elf intitled to &s;ome &s;hare of indulgence, for the humility, indu&s;try and patience I have ex|erted during a period of ten years, in which this unfortunate production hath been expo&s;ed to the cen&s;ure of critics of all degrees; and in con&s;equence of their &s;everal opinions, altered, and (I hope) amended, times without number.</P>
<P>Had &s;ome of tho&s;e who were plea&s;ed to call them|&s;elves my friends, been at any pains to de&s;erve the character, and told me ingenuou&s;ly what I had to expect in the capacity of an author, when I fir&s;t profe&s;&s;ed my&s;elf of that venerable fraternity, I &s;hould, in all probability, have &s;pared my&s;elf the incredible labour and chagrin I have &s;ince undergone: but, as early as the year 1739, my play was taken into the protection of one of tho&s;e little fellows who are &s;ometimes called great men; and, like other or|phans, neglected accordingly.</P>
<P><PB N="xxxvii" REF="360">
Stung with re&s;entment, which I mi&s;took for con|tempt, I re&s;olved to puni&s;h this barbarous indiffe|rence, and actually di&s;carded my patron; con&s;oling my&s;elf with the barren prai&s;e of a few a&s;&s;ociates, who, in the mo&s;t indefatigable manner, employed their time and influence in collecting from all quar|ters ob&s;ervations on my piece, which, in con&s;equence of tho&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions, put on a new appearance al|mo&s;t every day, until my occa&s;ions called me out of the kingdom.</P>
<P>&mdash;Soon after my return, I and my production were introduced to a late Patentee, of courteous memory, who (re&s;t his &s;oul!) found means to amu&s;e me a whole &s;ea&s;on, and then declared it impractica|ble to bring it on till next year; advi&s;ing me to make my application more early in the winter, that we might have time to concert &s;uch alterations as &s;hould be thought nece&s;&s;ary for its &s;ucce&s;sful appearance on the &s;tage.&mdash;But I did not find my account in fol|lowing this whole&s;ome advice; for, to me, he was always le&s;s and le&s;s at lei&s;ure. In &s;hort, after &s;undry promi&s;es, and numberle&s;s eva&s;ions, in the cour&s;e of which he practi&s;ed upon me the whole art of pro|cra&s;tination,
<PB N="xxxviii" REF="370">
I demanded his final an&s;wer, with &s;uch ob&s;tinacy and warmth, that he could no longer re&s;i&s;t my importunity, and refu&s;ed my Tragedy in plain terms.&mdash;Not that he mentioned any material objec|tions to the piece it&s;elf, but &s;eemed to fear my in|tere&s;t was not &s;ufficient to &s;upport it in the repre&s;en|tation; affirming, that no dramatic compo&s;ition, however perfect, could &s;ucceed with an Engli&s;h au|dience by its own merit only; but mu&s;t entirely de|pend upon a faction rai&s;ed in its behalf.&mdash;Incen&s;ed at this unexpected declaration, I reproached him bitterly for having trifled with me &s;o long; and, like my brother Bayes, threatened to carry my per|formance to the other hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This was actually my intention, when I was given to under&s;tand by a friend, that a nobleman of great weight had expre&s;&s;ed an inclination to peru&s;e it; and that, as intere&s;t was requi&s;ite, I could not do better than gratify his de&s;ire with all expedition. I com|mitted it accordingly to the care of my coun&s;ellor, who undertook to give me a good account of it in le&s;s than a fortnight: but four months elap&s;ed be|fore I heard any tidings of my play; and then it
<PB N="xxxix" REF="380">
was retrieved by pure accident (I believe) from the mo&s;t di&s;honourable apartment of his lord&s;hip's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Enraged at the behaviour of this &s;upercilious peer, and exceedingly mortified at the mi&s;carriage of all my efforts, I wreaked my re&s;entment upon the in|nocent cau&s;e of my di&s;graces, and forthwith con|demned it to oblivion, where, in all probability, it would have for ever &s;lept, like a mi&s;erable abortion, had not a young gentleman of learning and ta&s;te waked my paternal &s;en&s;e, and per&s;uaded me not only to re&s;cue it from the tomb, where it had lain two whole years, but al&s;o to new model the plan, which was imperfect and undige&s;ted before, and mould it into a regular tragedy, confined within the unities of the drama.</P>
<P>Thus improved, it fell into the hands of a gen|tleman who had wrote for the &s;tage, and happened to plea&s;e him &s;o much, that he &s;poke of it very cor|dially to a young nobleman, &s;ince decea&s;ed, who, in the mo&s;t generous manner, charged him&s;elf with the care of introducing it to the public; and, in the

mean time, honoured me with his own remarks, in conformity to which, it was immediately altered, and offered by his lord&s;hip to the new manager of Drury-lane theatre. It was about the latter end of the &s;ea&s;on when this candid per&s;onage, to whom I owe many obligations for the exerci&s;es of patience he has &s;et me, received the performance, which, &s;ome weeks after, he returned, a&s;&s;uring my friend that he was pre-engaged to another author, but if I could be prevailed upon to re&s;erve it till the en&s;uing winter, he would bring it on.&mdash;In the interim, my noble patron left London, whither he was doomed never to return; and the con&s;cientious manager next &s;ea&s;on, in&s;tead of fulfilling his own promi&s;e and my expectation, gratified the town with the production of a player, the fate of which every body knows.</P>
<P>I &s;hall leave the reader to make his reflections on this event, and proceed to relate the other particulars of fortune, that attended my unhappy i&s;&s;ue, which in the &s;ucceeding &s;pring, had the good luck to ac|quire the approbation of an eminent wit, who pro|po&s;ed a few amendments, and recomended it to a
<PB N="xli" REF="400">
per&s;on, by who&s;e influence, I laid my account with &s;eeing it appear at la&s;t, with &s;uch advantage as &s;hould make ample amends for all my di&s;appoint|ments.</P>
<P>But here too, I reckoned without my ho&s;t. The ma&s;ter of Covent Garden theatre, bluntly rejected it, as a piece altogether unfit for the &s;tage; even after he had told me, in pre&s;ence of another gentle|man, that he believed he &s;hould not venture to find &s;ault with any performance which had gained the good opinion of the honourable per&s;on who ap|proved and recommended my play.</P>
<P>Baffled in every attempt, I renounced all hopes of its &s;eeing the light, when a humane lady of quality interpo&s;ed, &s;o urgently in its behalf, with my worthy friend the other manager, that he very complai&s;antly received it again, and had recour&s;e to the old my&s;tery of protraction, which he exerci&s;ed with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that the &s;ea&s;on was almo&s;t con|&s;umed, before he could afford it a reading. My patience being by this time quite exhau&s;ted, I de|&s;ired a gentleman, who intere&s;ted him&s;elf in my
<PB N="xlii" REF="410">
concerns, to go and expo&s;tulate with the vaticide: and indeed, this piece of friend&s;hip he performed with &s;o much zeal, upbraiding him with his eva&s;ive and pre&s;umptuous behaviour, that the &s;age politician was enraged at his reprimand; and in the mettle of his wrath, pronounced my play a wretched piece, deficient in language, &s;entiment, character, and plan. My friend, who was &s;urpri&s;ed at the hardine&s;s and &s;everity of this &s;entence, a&s;king how he come to change his opinion, which had been more favourable when the tragedy was fir&s;t put into his hands; he an&s;wered, that his opinion was not al|tered, neither had he ever uttered an expre&s;&s;ion in its favour.</P>
<P>This was an unlucky a&s;&s;ertion&mdash;For, the other immediately produced a letter which I had received from the young nobleman two years before, be|ginning with the&s;e words&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Sir, I have received Mr. L&mdash;'s an&s;wer; who &s;ays, he thinks your play has indubitable merit, but has prior promi&s;es to Mr. T&mdash;n, as an hone&s;t man, cannot be evaded.&endq;</Q>&mdash;And
<PB N="xliii" REF="420">
concluding thus; <Q>&startq;As the manager has promi&s;ed me the choice of the &s;ea&s;on next year, if you'll be advi&s;ed by me, re&s;t it with me.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>After having made &s;ome remarks &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion, my friend left him to chew the cud of re|flection, the re&s;ult of which was, a me&s;&s;age to my patrone&s;s, importing, (with many expre&s;&s;ions of duty) that neither the circum&s;tances of his compa|ny, nor the advanced &s;ea&s;on of the year, would permit him to obey her command, but if I would wait till next winter, and during the &s;ummer, make &s;uch alterations as I had agreed to, at a conference with &s;ome of his principal performers, he would a&s;&s;uredly put my play in rehear&s;al, and in the mean time give me an obligation in writing, for my fur|ther &s;atisfaction&mdash;I would have taken him at his word, without he&s;itation, but was per&s;uaded to di&s;|pen&s;e with the proffered &s;ecurity, that I might not &s;eem to doubt the influence or authority of her lady&s;hip.&mdash;The play, however, was altered and pre&s;ented to this upright director, who renounced his engagement, without the lea&s;t &s;cruple, apology, or rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P><PB N="xliv" REF="430">
Thus have I in the mo&s;t impartial manner, (per|haps too circum&s;tantially) di&s;played the conduct of tho&s;e playhou&s;e managers with whom I have had any concern, relating to my tragedy: and what|ever di&s;putes have happened between the actors and me, are &s;uppre&s;&s;ed as frivolous animo&s;ities unworthy of the reader's attention.</P>
<P>Had I &s;uffered a repul&s;e when I fir&s;t pre&s;ented my performance, I &s;hould have had cau&s;e to complain of my being excluded from that avenue to the pub|lic favour, which ought to lie open to all men of genius; and how far I de&s;erve that di&s;tinction, I now leave the world to decide; after I have, in ju&s;tice to my&s;elf, declared that my hopes of &s;ucce&s;s were not derived from the partial applau&s;e of my own friends only, but in&s;pired (as &s;ome of my greate&s;t enemies know) by the approbation of per|&s;ons of the fir&s;t note in the republic of ta&s;te, who&s;e countenance, I vainly imagined, would have been an effectual introduction to the &s;tage.</P>
<P>Be that as it will, I hope the unprejudiced ob|&s;erver will own, with indignation and di&s;dain, that every di&s;appointment I have endured, was an accu|mulated
<PB N="xlv" REF="440">
injury; and the whole of my adver&s;ary's conduct, a &s;eries of the mo&s;t unju&s;tifiable equivoca|tion and in&s;olent ab&s;urdity: for, though he may be excu&s;able in refu&s;ing a work of this kind, either on account of his ignorance or di&s;cernment, &s;urely, neither the one nor the other can vindicate his di&s;|&s;imulation and breach of promi&s;e to the author.</P>
<P>Abu&s;e of prerogative, in matters of greater im|portance, prevails &s;o much at pre&s;ent, and is &s;o ge|nerally overlooked, that it is almo&s;t ridiculous to la|ment the &s;ituation of authors, who mu&s;t either, at once, forego all opportunities of acquiring reputa|tion in dramatic poetry, or humble them&s;elves &s;o, as to &s;oothe the pride, and humour the petulance of a meer Goth, who, by the mo&s;t prepo&s;terous dele|gation of power, may become &s;ole arbiter of this kind of writing.</P>
<P>Nay, granting that a bard is willing to pro&s;titute his talents &s;o &s;hamefully, perhaps he may never find an occa&s;ion to practice this vile conde&s;cen&s;ion to ad|vantage: for, after he has gained admi&s;&s;ion to a pa|tentee (who is often more difficult of acce&s;s than a
<PB N="xlvi" REF="450">
&s;overeign prince) and even made &s;hift to remove all other objections, an in&s;urmountable ob&s;tacle may be rai&s;ed by the manager's avarice, which will di&s;|&s;uade him from hazarding a certain expence on an uncertain i&s;&s;ue, when he can fill his theatre without running any ri&s;k, or di&s;obliging his principal actors, by putting them to the trouble of &s;tudying new parts.&mdash;</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, he will be apt to &s;ay within him&s;elf, <Q>&startq;If I mu&s;t entertain the town with variety, it is but natural that I &s;hould prefer the productions of my friends, or of tho&s;e who have any friends worth obliging, to the works of ob&s;cure &s;tran|gers, who have nothing to recommend them but a doubtful &s;uperiority of merit, which, in all like|lihood, will never ri&s;e in judgment again&s;t me.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>That &s;uch have been the reflections of patentees, I believe no man of intelligence and veracity will deny; and I will venture to affirm, that on the &s;trength of intere&s;t or connection with the &s;tage, &s;ome people have commenced dramatic authors,
<PB N="xlvii" REF="460">
who otherwi&s;e would have employed their faculties in exerci&s;es better adapted to their capacity.</P>
<P>After what has been &s;aid, any thing by way of application would be an in&s;ult on the under&s;tanding of the public, to which I owe and acknowledge the mo&s;t indelible obligation for former favours as well as for the uncommon encouragement I have received in the publication of the following play.</P>

<P>Ay, little did I think, when I was flogged for ne|glecting my Accidence, that ever my learning would turn to &s;uch account&mdash;Captain Maclaymore was &s;ur|prized to hear me &s;peak Latin: yes he found fault with my pronunciation.&mdash;He &s;hook me by the hand, though I was a little &s;hy of that compliment, and &s;aid he did not expect to find flowers under a nettle: but I put him in mind of the &s;ingat cat, for I was better than I was bonny&mdash;then he carried me to his cabin, where we might di&s;cour&s;e more freely; told me the captain was "a light-headed gu&s;e," and expre&s;&s;ed his concern at your captivity, which he &s;aid was a flagrant infraction of the treaty of Aix la Chapelle.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ON DR. SMOLLETT's ODE TO INDEPENDENCE.</HEAD>
<P>LYRIC POETRY imitates violent and ardent pa&s;&s;ions. It is therefore bold, various, and impe|tuous. It abounds with animated &s;entiments, glowing images, and forms of &s;peech often unu&s;ual, but com|monly nervous and expre&s;&s;ive. The compo&s;ition and arrangement of parts may often appear di&s;ordered, and the tran&s;itions &s;udden and ob&s;cure; but they are always natural, and are governed by the movements and va|riations of the imitated pa&s;&s;ion. The foregoing ode will illu&s;trate the&s;e ob&s;ervations.</P>
<LG>
<L>The Introduction is poetical and abrupt.</L>
<L>"Thy &s;pirit, Independence, let me &s;hare!</L>
<L>"Lord of the lion-heart and eagle-eye,</L>
<L>"Thy &s;teps I follow with my bo&s;om bare,</L>
<L>"Nor heed the &s;torm that howls along the &s;ky."</L>
</LG>
<P>The picture exhibited in the&s;e lines is &s;triking, becau&s;e the circum&s;tances are happily cho&s;en, briefly, and di&s;tinctly delineated. It is &s;ublime, becau&s;e the images are few, and in them&s;elves great and magnificent. The
<PB N="267" REF="3110">
"lion-heart and eagle-eye" &s;ugge&s;t an idea of the high &s;pirit and commanding a&s;pect of Independence: and the poet following with "bo&s;om bare" denotes, in a picture&s;que manner, the eagerne&s;s and enthu&s;iam of the votary. The la&s;t circum&s;tance is peculiarly happy.</P>
<P>"Nor heeds the &s;torm that howls along the &s;ky". It marks the &s;cene: it is unexpected, and excites &s;ur|prize: it is great and awful, and exites a&s;toni&s;hment. Combined with the preceding circum&s;tance, it con|veys a beautiful allegorical meaning; and &s;ignifies, that a mind truly independent is &s;uperior to adver&s;ity, and unmoved by external accidents. We may ob&s;erve too, in regard to the diction, that the notions of &s;ound and motion communicated by the words "howl" and "along," contribute, in a peculiar manner, to the &s;ublimity of the de&s;cription.</P>
<LG>
<L>"Lord of the lion-heart and eagle-eye,</L>
<L>`Thy &s;teps I follow with my bo&s;om bare,</L>
<L>`Nor heed the &s;torm that howls along the &s;ky.'</L>
</LG>
<P>The&s;e lines are written in the true &s;pirit of Lyric poe|try. Without preparing the mind by a cool artificial introduction, ri&s;ing gradually to the impetuo&s;ity of pa&s;|&s;ion, they a&s;&s;ail the imagination by an abrupt and &s;ud|den impul&s;e; they vibrate through the &s;oul, and fire us in&s;tantaneou&s;ly with all the ardour and enthu&s;ia&s;m of
<PB N="268" REF="3120">
the poet. Many of the odes of Horace are compo&s;ed in the &s;ame &s;pirit, and produce &s;imilar effects. With|out any previous argument or introduction, in the ful|ne&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion and imagination, he breaks out in bold, powerful, and impetuous figures.</P>
<LG>
<L>"Quo me, Bacche, rapis, tui</L>
<L>"Plenum? Quae nemora aut quos agor in &s;pecus</L>
<L>"Velox mente nova?&mdash;</L>
<L>"Qualem mini&s;trum fulminis alitem"&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<P>The poet, full of enthu&s;ia&s;m and admiration, continues his pro&s;opopeia; and, in a &s;train of poetry exceedingly wild and romantic, gives us the genealogy of Inde|pendence.</P>
<LG>
<L>"A godde&s;s violated brought thee forth,</L>
<L>"Immortal Liberty, who&s;e look &s;ublime</L>
<L>"Hath bleached the tyrant's cheek in every varying clime."</L>
</LG>
<P>According to the acceptation of our author, Liberty means the &s;ecurity of our lives and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and freedom from external force: Independence is of higher import, and denotes that internal &s;en&s;e and con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of freedom which beget magnanimity, fortitude, and that becoming pride which leads us to re&s;pect our|&s;elves, and do nothing unworthy of our condition. Li|berty therefore is, with perfect propriety, &s;aid to be
<PB N="269" REF="3130">
the mother of Independence, and Di&s;dain his father&mdash;Di&s;dain ari&s;ing from indignation again&s;t an oppre&s;&s;or, and triumph on having fru&s;trated or e&s;caped his ma|lice. This &s;tern per&s;onage is &s;trongly characterized in the following direct de&s;cription.</P>
<LG>
<L>"Of ample front the portly chief appear'd:</L>
<L>"The hunted bear &s;upply'd a &s;haggy ve&s;t;</L>
<L>"The drifted &s;now hung on his yellow beard;</L>
<L>"And his broad &s;houlders braved the furious bla&s;t."</L>
</LG>
<P>Men may enjoy liberty without independence: they may be &s;ecure in their per&s;ons and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, without feeling any uncommon elevation of mind, or any &s;en&s;e of their freedom. But if their liberty is attacked, they are alarmed, they feel the value of their condition, they are moved with indignation again&s;t their oppre&s;&s;ors, they exert them&s;elves, and if they are &s;ucce&s;sful, or e&s;cape the danger that threatened them, they triumph, they reflect on the happine&s;s and dignity conferred by freedom, they applaud them&s;eves for their exertions, be|come magnanimous and independent. There is therefore no le&s;s propriety in deducing the origin of Independence from Di&s;dain and Liberty, than in fixing the aera of his birth. The Saxons, according to our author, free, &s;imple, and inoffen&s;ive, were attacked, e&s;caped the violence of their adver&s;ary, reflected on the felicity of their condition, and learned independence.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="3140">
The education of Independence, and the &s;cene of his nativity, are &s;uited to his illu&s;trious lineage, and to the high atchievements for which he was de&s;tined.</P>
<LG>
<L>"The light he &s;aw in Albion's happy plains,</L>
<L>"Where under cover of a flowering thorn,</L>
<L>"While Philomel renewed her warbled &s;trains,</L>
<L>"The au&s;picious fruit of &s;tol'n embrace was born&mdash;</L>
<L>"The mountain Dryads &s;eized with joy,</L>
<L>"The &s;miling infant to their charge con&s;ign'd;</L>
<L>"The Doric mu&s;e care&s;&s;ed the favourite boy;</L>
<L>"The hermit Wi&s;dom &s;tored his opening mind.'&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<P>The imagery in the&s;e lines is &s;oft and agreeable, the language &s;mooth, and the ver&s;ification numerous.</P>
<P>Independence thus de&s;cended, and thus divinely in|&s;tructed and endowed, di&s;tingui&s;hes him&s;elf accordingly by heroic and beneficent actions.</P>
<LG>
<L>"Accompli&s;h'd thus, he winged his way,</L>
<L>"And zealous roved from pole to pole,</L>
<L>"The rolls of right eternal to di&s;play,</L>
<L>"And warm with patriot thoughts the a&s;piring &s;oul."</L>
</LG>
<P>The ode may be divided into three parts. The poet &s;ets out with a brief addre&s;s to Independence, imploring his protection. He &s;ees, in idea, the high object of his adoration, and, tran&s;ported by an ardent and irre&s;i&s;tible impul&s;e, he rehear&s;es his birth, education, and quali|ties.
<PB N="271" REF="3150">
He proceeds, in the &s;econd place, to celebrate his office and mo&s;t renowned atchievements; and re|turns, at the end of the third &s;trophe, to acknowledge with gratitude the protection he had reque&s;ted, and the power of Independence in pre&s;erving him untainted by the deba&s;ing influences of Grandeur, and the admira|tion of vain magnificence. Animated with this reflec|tion, and con&s;cious of the dignity annexed to an inde|pendent &s;tate of mind, he inveighs again&s;t tho&s;e <Q>&startq;Mi|nions of Fortune&endq;</Q> who would impo&s;e upon mankind by the o&s;tentation of wealth, and the parade of pa|geantry.</P>

</LG>
<P><PB N="272" REF="3160">
The&s;e lines, embelli&s;hed by fancy, and recommended to the heart by harmony, are the invective of truth and hone&s;t indignation.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t anti&s;trophe the poet de&s;cends from his en|thu&s;ia&s;m; he is le&s;s impetuous; the illu&s;trious pa&s;&s;ions that animated and impelled him are exhau&s;ted; but they leave his mind full of their genuine and benign influences, not agitated and di&s;ordered, as if their tendency had been vicious, but glowing with &s;elf-ap|probation, &s;oft, gentle, and compo&s;ed.</P>
