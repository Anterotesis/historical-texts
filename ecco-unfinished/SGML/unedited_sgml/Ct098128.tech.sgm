<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Court of Ea&s;t-India Directors, having, perhaps
indu&s;triou&s;ly, involved the affairs of the Carnatic in
ob&s;curity, by their voluminous Defence, the Author of the fol|lowing
Work found him&s;elf obliged to deduce his accounts,
from an early period of time. To extricate the &s;ubject from
difficulty, he has connected the controver&s;ial part of the
di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, with an authentic and impartial narrative of the
mo&s;t important tran&s;actions, on the coa&s;t of Coromandel.
His arguments and rea&s;onings are only &s;uch, as naturally
re&s;ult from his facts; and his facts are founded upon the
mo&s;t incontrovertible evidence, to which the Reader is
referred, at the bottom of every page.</P>
<P>The Directors, in the volumes of Original Papers, pub|li&s;hed
under their in&s;pection, have furni&s;hed the Author,
with authentic materials, &s;ufficient to over&s;et entirely the
&s;y&s;tem, which they wi&s;hed to defend. He has al&s;o availed
him&s;elf of the information of other papers of EQUAL AU|THORITY,
which a Gentleman employed by the Crown, for
&s;ome years, in a public capacity on the Coa&s;t, was plea&s;ed
to place in his hands. Private papers and documents, to|gether
with written evidences of a PRIVATE nature, which
unveil the &s;prings of many mea&s;ures, have come into his
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. But as his object has been, to expo&s;e PUBLIC
<PB REF="5">
inju&s;tice, and not to trace the delinquency of INDIVIDUALS,
he has made no u&s;e of &s;uch information. Though &s;ome
may think or, at lea&s;t, allege, that public bodies, as well
as public mea&s;ures, are treated with a degree of &s;everity,
in the following Volume, the Writer cannot be accu&s;ed of
har&s;hne&s;s to private characters. Should any of the actors,
in the &s;cene, which he has cho&s;en to exhibit, complain of
their parts, the Author of the piece a&s;&s;ures them and the
Public, that much of the bu&s;ine&s;s is concealed, behind
the curtain.</P>
<P>The labour and toil, which attended the &s;election of the
materials, upon which this Volume is founded, employed
a con&s;iderable portion of time. The facts and authorities
were weighed, with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous attention to truth
and impartial ju&s;tice. The relation of tran&s;actions is &s;up|ported,
every where, by a cloud of witne&s;&s;es; and where
the conduct of the Company is mo&s;t blamed, the founda|tion
of cen&s;ure is placed, on their own records, as pub|li&s;hed
by their Directors. In the printing, and even in the
compo&s;ition, of the Work, the &s;hortne&s;s of the time al|lotted
to both may have been productive of errors. But
as the arrangement has not been &s;ubject to that inconveni|ence,
it is to be hoped, the matter of fact is e&s;tabli&s;hed,
beyond the reach of any ju&s;t reply.</P>
<P>Without pre&s;umption, we tru&s;t, it may be affirmed,
that the &s;y&s;tem, which the Directors endeavoured, with &s;o much
<PB N="4" REF="6">
labour and expence, to defend, has been completely over|turned.
That they have not only failed &startq;in refuting any
one of the heavy charges brought again&s;t them,&endq; in
former publications relative to Tanjore; but that many
other charges equally heavy are e&s;tabli&s;hed, on their own
evidence. That it only remains for them to retrieve their
characters, by acknowledging their errors and doing ju&s;tice.
That a contrary conduct will probably remind the nation of
their &s;olemn appeal to the Public, in their Declaration of
the 26th of March 1777. Their words were, &startq;That could
the heavy charges brought again&s;t them be proved, tho&s;e
charges would not only render them unfit to conduct
the affairs of the Company, but utterly unworthy of
every degree of public tru&s;t and confidence.&endq; If the
charges are actually proved, the World will draw the in|ference.</P>
<P>In the authorities, at the bottoms of the pages, the pa|pers
publi&s;hed by the Directors, in their own defence, are
cited, under the title of Mr. Rous's Appendix. This ap|pellation
was adopted merely to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e papers,
from others publi&s;hed by the Directors. As the Court had
di&s;avowed Mr. Rous's pamphlet, by refu&s;ing to authenticate
it, that gentleman, &s;trictly &s;peaking, had no <HI>legal</HI> right to
an Appendix, printed at the expence of the Company.</P>
<P>The writers, who have e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of the Di|rectors,
are &s;eldom alluded to, and never mentioned, in
<PB REF="7">
the cour&s;e of the following Volume. This &s;eeming neg|lect
proceeded neither from any di&s;re&s;pect for their genius,
nor any want of attention to their labours. Their toil has
&s;urely been rewarded, by their employers, in proportion to
the badne&s;s of their cau&s;e. With that boon they ought to
&s;it down contented; and to add to the account of profit,
their pre&s;ent e&s;cape from cen&s;ure. To pur&s;ue phantoms,
through the foggy regions of romance, was no part of the
labour, which the Author impo&s;ed on him&s;elf. Truth, and
only truth, was his object; and the advocates of his oppo|nents
are completely an&s;wered, if he has attained his end.</P>
<P>The wading through the &s;ink of Ea&s;t-India corruption
and mi&s;management is a ta&s;k, which adds di&s;gu&s;t to toil.
But the Author fears he has gone too far, not to go further
&s;till. Bengal is a fruitful &s;cene of peculation, inju&s;tice,
and even death; and the Northern Circars, though &s;carcely
twelve years, in our hands, pre&s;ent oppre&s;&s;ions proportion|able
to their extent and <HI>our</HI> time. The &s;ecret intrigues in
Leadenhall-Street, though le&s;s important and in&s;tructive,
than the revolutions of kingdoms, merit &s;ome attention;
and the world may chu&s;e to be made acquainted with the
actors in the &s;ecret &s;cenes of dome&s;tic management. The&s;e
con&s;iderations may, perhaps, induce the Author, to give a
SECOND VOLUME to the Public, in the cour&s;e of a few
months.</P>

<P>DURING the decline and after the fall of the Roman Empire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. I</NOTE>
the we&s;tern provinces received, in a certain degree, new in|habitants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Eu|rope after the fall of the Ro|mans.</NOTE>
and con&s;equently new manners, from tho&s;e va&s;t
countries, which comprehend the northern divi&s;ions of Europe and
A&s;ia. The fierce nations who triumphed over Rome had &s;carcely
brought any virtue, except valour, from home; and, therefore,
their ravages were too general and too de&s;tructive to leave any ex|amples
of that civilization, which in &s;ome degree atones for the
de&s;olations of war. In the mid&s;t of that barbarity, which had
cramped the liberal exertions of their minds in the north, the
invaders &s;at down in the regions of the &s;outh; where many ages
pa&s;&s;ed over them, without having been di&s;tingui&s;hed by any of tho&s;e
improvements, which, by rendering life comfortable, enlarge the
<PB N="2" REF="11">
views of mankind. The peculiar opinions, which annexed every
honour to the &s;word, threw contempt on the arts of civil life; and
the in&s;ecurity of property prevented even avarice, which di&s;regards
contempt, from pur&s;uing indu&s;try and commerce, as they could
produce nothing but toil.</P>
<P>Europe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Revival of arts and com|merce.</NOTE> however, was not de&s;tined to remain always under that
gloomy barbari&s;m, which had clouded its annals for near a thou&s;and
years. The fir&s;t dawn of improvement aro&s;e in Italy, where its la&s;t
ray had &s;et. The revival of letters, in that country, was followed by
the encouragement of genius. Men becoming acquainted with the
improvements of former ages, began to transfer their di&s;coveries to
their own times. The human mind, being &s;oftened by the acce&s;|&s;ion
of knowledge, acquired a ta&s;te for the &s;weets of peace and the
comforts of life. Government, relaxing its habitual &s;everity, and
laying a&s;ide its former pride, gave &s;ecurity to property, and &s;ome
protection to indu&s;try. A free intercour&s;e of commerce was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
at home; its communication with foreign &s;tates became le&s;s
ob&s;tructed; and either rival&s;hip or imitation &s;oon extended a degree
of the &s;ame kind of improvement to the re&s;t of Europe.</P>
<P>A commercial intercour&s;e had been opened between Europe and
India,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Progre&s;s of Indian com|merce in an|cient times.</NOTE> in remote antiquity. The Greeks knew it, when the Per&s;ian
empire flouri&s;hed; and they continued it, during the exi&s;tence of
their own. The Syrians, under the Seleucidae, who were the im|mediate
&s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Alexander, in his A&s;iatic conque&s;ts, brought
the manufactures of India to the we&s;tern markets, through the
gulph of Per&s;ia. The Egyptians, when &s;ubject to the Ptolemies,
&s;upplied Europe, in the &s;ame manner, by the Red Sea. The Ro|mans
&s;ucceeded both, in their commerce, as well as in their power;
and transferred the trade of India, with the &s;eat of their empire, to
Con&s;tantinople. During the decline of the ea&s;tern empire, the Ita|lian
&s;tates, particularly the Venetians, engro&s;&s;ed the commerce of
<PB N="3" REF="12">
A&s;ia. The Portugue&s;e had the merit, by exploring a new pa&s;&s;age
to the Ea&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Portu|gue&s;e the fir&s;t who found a new cour&s;e to India.</NOTE> to lay open, though contrary to their inclination, that
beneficial trade to the re&s;t of Europe. The &s;ubjects of John the
Second, after coa&s;ting the we&s;tern &s;ide of Africa, doubled the Cape
of Good Hope; and Emanuel improved the plan e&s;tabli&s;hed by his
predece&s;&s;or. In the reign of the latter prince, the famous Va&s;co
de Gama, with four &s;hips, penetrated, beyond the Cape, into &s;eas
before unknown, and arrived on the coa&s;t of Malabar in 1498, about
&s;ix years after Columbus had di&s;covered America.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of the Portugue&s;e on the coa&s;t of India,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rea&s;ons why they were the fir&s;t.</NOTE> and the rich
cargoes which they imported from that country, rai&s;ed the envy,
but did not immediately excite the imitation of the re&s;t of Europe.
A whole century pa&s;&s;ed before tho&s;e nations, who now, in a man|ner,
engro&s;s the commerce of the Ea&s;t, turned their eyes to that
part of the world. The veil of &s;ecrecy, with which the Portu|gue&s;e
had indu&s;triou&s;ly covered their cour&s;e to India, was not the
only cau&s;e which prevented them from having rivals in their con|que&s;ts
as well as their commerce. The principles of navigation and
internal policy were &s;till in their infancy in England. France was
only ju&s;t emerging from the &s;avage rudene&s;s of its feudal &s;y&s;tem;
and the Dutch had not yet emancipated them&s;elves from the &s;tern
tyranny of the heirs of the hou&s;e of Burgundy, &s;trengthened by
their acce&s;&s;ion to the crown of Spain.</P>
<P>The Dutch, &s;en&s;ible of the advantages of an Indian commerce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Dutch were the next.</NOTE>
from the &s;ucce&s;s of the Portugue&s;e, had turned their &s;peculations to|wards
a new and a more expeditious pa&s;&s;age to India, than that
which the latter had found, by doubling the &s;outhern point of Africa.
They endeavoured to make their way, by the north-ea&s;t, to the &s;eas
of China and Japan; and to arrive fir&s;t on tho&s;e coa&s;ts, which to
<PB N="4" REF="13">
the Portugue&s;e were the mo&s;t remote in the Ea&s;t-Indies<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Di&s;cours &s;ur le Pa&s;&s;age par le Nord-e&s;t de I' Europe, dans les Mers des Indes.&mdash;Grot. Annal. Le Clerc, Ba&s;nage.</NOTE> A di&s;co|very
of that kind would not only &s;horten the voyage, but dimini&s;h
its dangers; as the commerce of the Portugue&s;e, together with the
dominion of their country, had fallen to Philip the Second, the
mortal enemy of the Dutch nation. Their attempts to find a north-ea&s;t
pa&s;&s;age were &s;uddenly undertaken, and as &s;uddenly laid a&s;ide.
But an accident &s;upplied what their indu&s;try bad, in vain, endea|voured
to acquire. A Dutch &s;eaman, who&s;e name was Houtman,
and who had been &s;eized in Portugal, in the year 1594, di&s;covered
the route of the Portugue&s;e, by the Cape of Good Hope<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Averti&s;&s;ement &agrave; la t&ecirc;te de Recueil de Voy|ages de la Compagnie, p. 27.</NOTE> Under
the direction of Houtman a fleet was equipped, and in the year
1596 &s;ailed from the Texel<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vide Journal of this Voyage, printed a$ London, 1601.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h nation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">After them the Engli&s;h.</NOTE> like the Dutch, had attempted to find a new
pa&s;&s;age to India. Before their neighbours on the continent had
turned their attention to the north-ea&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Origin of the India Com|pany.</NOTE> they had made three differ|ent
attempts to explore a pa&s;&s;age to Tartary and China, by the
north-we&s;t. But the lights furni&s;hed by Drake, Cavendi&s;h, and
other eminent navigators,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1600.</NOTE> pointed out a more direct way to the
trade of India. Encouraged by their di&s;coveries, &s;everal wealthy
merchants of London petitioned Queen Elizabeth for a charter em|powering
them to undertake this trade. On the 31&s;t of December
1600, the prayer of their petition was granted. They were erected
into a body corporate, by the &s;tile of &startq;The Governor and Company
of Merchants of London, trading to the Ea&s;t Indies.&endq; The charter
granted a common &s;eal: Thomas Smith, an alderman, was ap|pointed
Governor, with twenty Directors, to be cho&s;en annually on
the 1&s;t of July, or &s;ix days after. They were ve&s;ted with powers
<PB N="5" REF="14">
to make bye-laws, to export goods free from cu&s;tom, for four years,
to &s;end to India by every voyage 30,000 l. in foreign coin, provided
they brought that &s;um by their commerce from foreign countries.
The charter was exclu&s;ive; the Queen bound her&s;elf to grant none
to other merchants, for the &s;pace of fifteen years; but a provi&s;ion
was made, that if it appeared the new Corporation &s;hould prove, in
any re&s;pect, detrimental to the Public, the charter, upon two years
warning, under the Privy Seal, &s;hould become void. The exclu|&s;ive
commerce, granted in the charter, extended to all places of A&s;ia,
Africa, and America, beyond the Cape of Good Hope, and the
Streights of Magellan; and to execute the de&s;ign, a joint &s;tock of
72,000 l. was quickly &s;ub&s;cribed and paid into the trea&s;urer's hands.</P>
<P>This capital enabled the Company to equip and man five &s;hips
of &s;mall burden;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their fir&s;t&punc; ex|pedition to In|dia &s;ucce&s;sful.</NOTE> and to &s;end a con&s;iderable &s;um in money and
goods, as a trading &s;tock, The fleet put to &s;ea, under the command
of Captain James Lanca&s;ter; and after a tedious and &s;ickly pa&s;&s;age,
came to anchor in the road of Achin, in the i&s;land of Sumatra, on
the 5th of June 1602. The voyage was, however, &s;o pro&s;perous,
in point of commerce, that a &s;econd trading expedition, to India,
was undertaken in the year 1604, under the conduct of Sir Henry
Middleton. The &s;ucce&s;s of Middleton was &s;till greater than that of
Lanca&s;ter. But both yielded, in good fortune, to Captain Keeling,
who returned in May 1610, with three &s;hips committed to his care,
richly laden, and without the lo&s;s of a man.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the profit derived from the&s;e voyages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But &s;till they labour under us uncon|veniences $word$.</NOTE> the
trade to India was &s;till incon&s;iderable, and liable to great incon|veniency.
The &s;ucce&s;s of the adventurers depended entirely on
chance, on the civility of the natives, or on the addre&s;s of their
officers. Without &s;ettlements to accommodate their factors, de&s;ti|tute
of defences to protect their per&s;ons and property, they were
&s;ubject to di&s;appointment, and expo&s;ed to in&s;ult. Other nations
<PB N="6" REF="15">
had harbours, which they could command; forts, which they had
either built them&s;elves, or had bought from the Indians; and even
territories, acquired by treachery or conque&s;t. On the other hand,
the Company were &s;o far from commanding re&s;pect abroad, that
they were ill-provided with re&s;ources at home. Though the
Engli&s;h nation had already exhibited a great deal of &s;pirit, and a
con&s;iderable degree of knowledge in navigation, they had made but
little progre&s;s in the art of &s;hip-building. The Company, during
the fir&s;t ten years of their de&s;ultory commerce to A&s;ia, had even been
obliged to purcha&s;e their &s;hips from the <HI>Han&s;e</HI> Towns of Germany.</P>
<P>Though the Company laboured under the&s;e di&s;advantages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their com|merce, con&s;i|dering the times valu|able.</NOTE> their
profits, if compared to their capital, were very con&s;iderable; and,
con&s;idering the &s;tate of commerce in tho&s;e times, an acqui&s;ition to
the wealth of the nation. Government, therefore, enlarged the
time of their charter; and, encouraged by the countenance of the
State, they them&s;elves began to build their own &s;hips. In the year
1609,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1609.</NOTE> they launched a &s;hip of twelve hundred tons, in the pre&s;ence
of King James, and his &s;on the Prince of Wales. This &s;hip,
together with two others of con&s;iderable burden, under the conduct
of Sir Henry Middleton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their quarrel with the Por|tugue&s;e.</NOTE> &s;ailed for Surat; where the jealou&s;y of the
Portugue&s;e fru&s;trated the intention of the voyage. Middleton made
up for his lo&s;s in trade, by a &s;pecies of piracy. He &s;eized &s;ome
rich &s;hips belonging to the Portugue&s;e, on the coa&s;t of Malabar;
and, &s;teering his cour&s;e to the Red Sea, plundered the trade of
Mocha, under the pretence of procuring &s;atisfaction for damages he
had formerly &s;u&s;tained at that place.</P>
<P>The inju&s;tice and power of the Portugue&s;e had,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1610.</NOTE> hitherto, pre|vented
the Engli&s;h from e&s;tabli&s;hing them&s;elves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Engli&s;h, in a manner, ex|cluded from the continent of India.</NOTE> or even from pur|&s;uing
commerce, with any degree of &s;ucce&s;s, on the coa&s;t of Hin|do&s;tan.
The hou&s;e of Tamerlane, who had reigned near a century
at Delhi, had uniformly encouraged foreigners to trade in their do|minions.
<PB N="7" REF="16">
But, as they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no naval power, they could
not enforce their authority beyond their own &s;hores, or prevent
ho&s;tilities at &s;ea, between the rivals for their trade. Though in the
year 1608, the third of the reign of Jehangire, an envoy from the
Company had obtained the u&s;ual privileges of &s;ettlement and com|merce
from that prince, they had been debarred from the advan|tages
of both,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They defeat the Portu|gue&s;e.</NOTE> by the intrigues of the Portugue&s;e. Force only could
obtain ju&s;tice from that jealous nation, who claimed, from their
long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, a kind of exclu&s;ive right to the commerce of India.
Four &s;hips of con&s;iderable burden were, therefore, put under the
command of Captain Thomas Be&s;t, a re&s;olute officer. He arrived at
Surat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1612.</NOTE> in September 1612; and having defeated, in two actions,
the Portugue&s;e &s;quadron, enabled the factors of the Company to
avail them&s;elves of the privileges, which they had obtained in the
Empire.</P>
<P>To &s;ecure the advantages obtained by the victory of Be&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1614.</NOTE> the Com|pany
prevailed with King James the Fir&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An amba&s;&s;a|dor &s;ent by King James I. to the Mogul.</NOTE> to &s;end a royal amba&s;&s;a|dor
to the court of Hindo&s;tan. The per&s;on ve&s;ted with this high
character, was Sir Thomas Roe, who arrived in the end of 1614, at
Ajmere, the capital of the province of that name, where the Em|peror
Jehangire, at that time, kept his court. But though the am|ba&s;&s;ador

which, at its be&s;t, depended merely on lucky adventures.
The Hi&s;tory of the Company, from this period forward, con&s;i&s;ts of
in&s;tances of misfortunes in trade, and in&s;tances of &s;pirit in adventure
and &s;eats of valour in war. Rivalled, and even ruined a&s;hore, by the
Portugue&s;e and Dutch, they revenged them&s;elves of the former at &s;ea;
but the latter, by their barbarous feverities at Amboyna, in the year
1622, put, in a manner, an end to their trade with the i&s;lands of A&s;ia.
On the coa&s;ts of Hindo&s;tan, and even in &s;ome inland cities of that
great empire, they continued to carry on a languid commerce for
&s;everal years. The government of the Moguls had, then, arrived
at a degree of vigour, &s;ufficient to command peace, and even ju&s;tice,
between the Europeans under its protection. The advantages de|rived
from the commerce of foreigners, had even procured for them

the throne, one Boughton, an Engli&s;h &s;urgeon, &s;ent from Surat to
Agra, had the good fortune to cure the emperor's favourite daugh|ter,
who laboured under an illne&s;s, which had baffled the &s;kill of the
natives. Among other favours, Boughton was gratified with a pa|tent,
or Du&s;tue, for a free trade throughout the empire. Having
proceeded to Bengal, his &s;kill in phy&s;ic procured for him the friend|&s;hip
of the Nabob of that province; who extended the privileges
given to Boughton, to the whole Engli&s;h nation<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Orme, vol. ii. p. 8.</NOTE>. The Company's
&s;ervants at Surat, availing them&s;elves of the influence of Boughton,
built a factory at Hughley, on the we&s;tern branch of the Ganges,
one hundred miles from the mouth of the river.</P>
<P>But the privileges obtained by Boughton, for his countrymen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their com|merce lo&s;t during the civil war.</NOTE>
were incapable of re&s;toring vigour to a commerce, which had fallen
into an irrecoverable decline. Hara&s;&s;ed abroad by European rivals,
who, from their &s;uperior advantages, could bring their imports
cheaper to market at home, the Company lo&s;t their &s;pirit with their
&s;ucce&s;s. To ha&s;ten their fate, the civil commotions, which after|wards
terminated in the &s;ubver&s;ion of the con&s;titution of the &s;tate,
engaged the whole attention, and employed the whole exertion of
the nation. The Dutch, availing them&s;elves of the decline of the
Portugueze, and the di&s;tractions in England, engro&s;&s;ed the com|merce
of the Ea&s;t; and even Cromwell, though he gained a &s;upe|viority
over them in war, neglected, as perhaps he under&s;tood not,
the intere&s;ts of the nation in India, in a peace, the conditions of
which he dictated him&s;elf. He, however, renewed to the Company
their ancient privileges in 1657;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1657.</NOTE> but before they could avail them|&s;elves

The revolution, which re&s;tored England to its ancient con&s;titu|tion,
brought back,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1661.</NOTE> &s;oon after, the commerce of India to its former
channel.<NOTE PLACE="marg">New charter granted by Charles II.</NOTE> Charles the Second, though addicted to plea&s;ure, was ca|pable
of u&s;eful exertions, and he loved commerce. His brother, the
Duke of York, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of le&s;s ability, was endued with
greater per&s;everance; and, by a peculiar felicity, placed his chief
amu&s;ement in commercial &s;chemes, whil&s;t he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the whole in|fluence
of the &s;tate. Under his au&s;pices, a new charter was i&s;&s;ued,
on the 3d of April 1661. The animo&s;ity of the two royal brothers
again&s;t the Dutch, the manife&s;t advantage to the revenue, as
well as to the nation, which was likely to be derived from the
commerce of India, in&s;ured the &s;upport of government to the
Company.</P>
<P>The charter which had been granted by Queen Elizabeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great privi|leges and powers granted.</NOTE> in the
forty-third year of her reign, inve&s;ted the Company with an exclu|&s;ive
right of commerce for fifteen years. They had been erected
into a perpetual body-politic, by a charter which they had obtained
in the &s;eventh of James the Fir&s;t. In that of April 3, 1661, new
privileges were added to the old, which were all confirmed. The
Company were inve&s;ted with a civil juri&s;diction and a military
authority, with a power of making war or concluding peace with
the INFIDELS of India; the &s;tate re&s;erving to it&s;elf, by this di&s;tinc|tion,
tho&s;e prerogatives, with re&s;pect to Europeans. They were
al&s;o impowered to export bullion to the amount of 150,000 l. in
every voyage, provided they re-exported foreign goods to the &s;ame
amount. The clau&s;e in the charter granted by Elizabeth was
re&s;erved, which declared, that it &s;hould become void and of no
effect, after three years notice given, &s;hould the privileges granted
prove detrimental to the general intere&s;t of the nation. A capital of
369, 890 l. was &s;ub&s;cribed, though only one half was paid, to derive
<PB N="11" REF="20">
immediate advantage from privileges as exten&s;ive in them&s;elves, as
they were liberally be&s;towed by the Crown.</P>
<P>Charles the Second,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Company much favour|ed by the King and Duke of York.</NOTE> having e&s;pou&s;ed the Infanta of Portugal in
1662, obtained the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;land of Bombay in the year
1663, as a part of the portion of that Prince&s;s. Finding that the
revenues of the place were unequal to its expence, the King ceded
it, in fee-tail, to the Company, in the twentieth year of his reign;
and, five years after, he al&s;o granted to them the i&s;land of St. He|lena.
To this ce&s;&s;ion of territory, Government added its whole &s;up|port,
in the encouragement and protection of the Company's trade.
The injuries which they had received from the jealou&s;y of the Dutch
Company, had formed one of the o&s;ten&s;ible rea&s;ons for entering into
the fir&s;t Dutch war. The Commons, by the management of Govern|ment,
which then was &s;wayed by the Duke of York, addre&s;&s;ed the
Crown, again&s;t the wrongs and indignities done to the Ea&s;t-India
Company. The Duke him&s;elf, who &s;pent half his time in the bu|&s;ine&s;s
of commerce in the city, pre&s;ided frequently at the meetings
of the Court of Directors. In &s;hort, no aid was wanting to the
pro&s;perity of the Company, that either the a&s;&s;iduity of the Duke or
his influence in the &s;tate could procure.</P>
<P>The encouragement and protection of government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their &s;ucce&s;s rai&s;es jealou|&s;ies.</NOTE> joined to their
own indu&s;try, rai&s;ed the Company, in outward appearance, to a &s;tate
of amazing affluence in the &s;pace of a few years. In 1680 and the
three &s;ucceeding years, the price of India &s;tock was 360 per cent.
with proportionable dividends. Circum&s;tances &s;o favourable could
not fail to rai&s;e the jealou&s;y of foreigners, and to inflame the avarice
of individuals at home. The mercantile intere&s;t and the court be|came,
at length, divided, on a &s;ubject of &s;o much importance. The
fir&s;t were prompted, by their eagerne&s;s for gain, to invade the
exclu&s;ive rights contained in the charter; the latter, won by the
influence, and perhaps the money, of the Company, as eagerly op|po&s;ed
their de&s;igns.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="21">
During the latter years of the life of Charles the Second, the vic|tory
obtained by the court over the city, repre&s;&s;ed the complaints
of the merchants of London,<NOTE PLACE="marg">More ample privileges given by Charles II.</NOTE> as they were likely to produce no good
effect again&s;t a &s;ociety favoured by government. Charles had re|newed
the charter, in the twenty-eighth year of his reign; he had
extended the privileges of the Company in the thirty-fifth; but when
his brother James the Second acceded to the throne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">James II. grants &s;till more exten|&s;ive powers.</NOTE> he poured his
favours, with a very lavi&s;h hand, on a body whom he had before
patronized. To rai&s;e them into an equality with the Dutch Com|pany,
and, perhaps, to give them a &s;uperiority over their republican
rivals, he not only increa&s;ed their immunities, but even transferred
to them many of his own prerogatives. He impowered them to
build fortre&s;&s;es, to levy troops, to determine cau&s;es, under the form
of courts martial, and to coin money. Encouraged by &s;o many
privileges, under the patronage of a Prince, who both knew and
loved trade, the Company not only a&s;&s;umed the pride, but even the
tyranny of &s;overeignty. In&s;tead of repre&s;&s;ing the encroachments of
their foreign rivals,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1686.</NOTE> they per&s;ecuted &s;uch of their countrymen as
&s;eemed inclined to invade their exclu&s;ive commerce. The principal
&s;ervants abroad, encouraged and protected by tho&s;e who managed
the affairs of the Company at home, carried in&s;olence, oppre&s;&s;ion,
and inju&s;tice into every department of their government.</P>

is &s;eldom &s;wayed by re&s;traints of either kind. As they derive,

no generous inducements to follow virtue, the mo&s;t fordid pa&s;&s;ions
frequently lead them into vice. It is from this circum&s;tance, that the

revenge. The&s;e ob&s;ervations may be applied, without the
lea&s;t inju&s;tice, to the actions of the India Company both at home
and abroad. Avarice, the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate and hardened pa&s;&s;ion of
the human mind, being the fir&s;t principle of commerce, was the
original bond of their union; and humanity, ju&s;tice, and even policy,
gave way to the pro&s;pect or love of gain<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Be&s;ide that want of generous principle, which &s;eems excluded from the very in&s;titution of a &s;overeign corporation of commerce, the great di&s;tance of their admini&s;tration in India &s;ecured the Company from a general in&s;pection into their conduct, and con&s;equently furni&s;hed ample opportunities for a wanton and uncon|trolled exerci&s;e of power. All re&s;i&s;tance, there|fore, to their arbitrary edicts, whether they regarded their own &s;ervants or the natives of the country, was con&s;idered as trea&s;on, and puni&s;hed with &s;everity. The rulers at home had their favourites abroad, whom they pro|tected in the mo&s;t cruel and oppre&s;&s;ive mea|&s;ures by their authority. Hence it happen|ed that private re&s;entments and &s;elfi&s;h views were too frequently the only rules of their conduct; and that their admini&s;tration had &s;carce any other principle of union, than a mutual permi&s;&s;ion to commit inju&s;tice. Even the exclu&s;ive privilege, which was thought ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the pro&s;perity of their commerce, became an engine of tyranny again&s;t all tho&s;e whom they con&s;idered as interlopers; and &s;uch in&s;tances of their barbarity might be pro|daced, &s;upported by facts, as would excite horror.</NOTE>.</P>

joint &s;tock had &s;uffered a lo&s;s to near one half of its original
amount. That when, by embezzlement, avarice, and inattention

their con&s;tituents, by unju&s;t and unrea&s;onable dividends, to give
the fallacious appearance of health to a body fallen into a deep
decline. That, though in pro&s;ecution of the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem of de|ception,
they had doubled their capital, in the year 1682, they had
not taken in but one half of the &s;um at fir&s;t &s;ub&s;cribed. That,

whil&s;t they were making extravagant dividends to the proprietors,
the Company was langui&s;hing under a debt of two millions at in|tere&s;t.
That, in&s;tead of an&s;wering legal demands, the Directors had
fixed a paper on the Trea&s;ury-door, declaring that they could pay
no more till a certain period; and all this at a time, when they

factors to borrow large &s;ums in India on the credit of the Company.
Their conduct, upon this occa&s;ion, was treacherous, ba&s;e and un|worthy
of the &s;ubjects of any civilized &s;tate. In their letters to
their factors they intimated, that as &s;oon as they had pu&s;hed their

quarrelling with the creditors, and of putting a &s;top to their trade<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hamilton, vol. i. p. 187.&mdash;Harris, vol. ii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The commands of the Directors were faithfully executed by

goods of their creditors and benefactors. One Sir John Child, a
repre&s;entative worthy of a vicious &s;ociety, without any declaration,
without the lea&s;t pretence to ju&s;tify ho&s;tilities, &s;eized thirteen rich

into that i&s;land. The conduct of the governor was as pu&s;illanimous
in war, as it had been in&s;olent and unju&s;t in time of peace. Being
pre&s;&s;ed by a &s;iege, three deputies, in the name of the Company,

Hou&s;e of Commons, having examined the &s;ubject in three different
&s;e&s;&s;ions, had propo&s;ed regulations for carrying on, in future, the
commerce with the Ea&s;t Indies. But the Company had eluded all the
endeavours of that a&s;&s;embly, by procuring a new charter from Queen
Mary, who managed the affairs of the kingdom in the ab&s;ence of King
William,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1694. September.</NOTE> in September 1694. The Hou&s;e of Commons having,
in the beginning of 1695,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1695.</NOTE> detected various flagrant abu&s;es in
the management of public affairs, were led to conclude, that the
court, the camp, the city, and even parliament, had been infected
with one general contagion of bribery, corruption, and venality.
The Ea&s;t India Company, having had the influence to remove the
con&s;ideration of their affairs from the legi&s;lature to the privy coun|cil,
were naturally &s;u&s;pected of having gained the King's principal
&s;ervants by bribes. The Commons, therefore, ordered a committee
to in&s;pect the books of the Company.<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are de|tected in bribery and corruption.</NOTE> The ab&s;tracts of the &s;ums

had &s;carcely exceeded 1200 l.; but in the year 1693, when the

Cooke, the governor of the Company, on who&s;e notes the money

the Commons, made a di&s;covery which was not &s;atisfactory. Ten

might have been borrowed upon common intere&s;t from individuals,
Parliament was ready to grant to the Company whatever privileges

declared between France and England, in the year 1744. The
French having failed, for near eighty years, in all their attempts to
erect and &s;upport an Ea&s;t-India Company, at length accompli&s;hed
their object about the year 1720. The regular returns made by the
French, ever &s;ince their complete e&s;tabli&s;hment in India, had been
&s;o con&s;iderable, that the jealou&s;y of the Briti&s;h Company was rai&s;ed.
Government, entering with &s;ome degree of warmth into that jea|lou&s;y,
turned a part of their attention towards the Ea&s;t, when war
<PB N="23" REF="32">
was likely to ari&s;e between the two nations. The French, fearing
ho&s;tilities, as they were anxious to promote a commerce &s;till in its
infancy, had propo&s;ed a neutrality between the two Companies, as
early as the year 1742. The Court of Directors, at fir&s;t, accepted
and then rejected the propo&s;al; but, whether in&s;tigated by Govern|ment,
or &s;wayed by their own ver&s;atility, is uncertain. When,
therefore, war commenced in Europe, its flame &s;pread to A&s;ia.
Their re&s;pective &s;overeigns a&s;&s;i&s;ted each Company; and, thus, the
bu&s;ine&s;s of commerce yielded to the occupations of arms. New
&s;cenes were opened; and events aro&s;e, which became the founda|tion

di&s;dained to permit the appearance of any &s;overeignty but their own.
Even the conque&s;ts and forts of the Portugue&s;e in India, had been
con&s;ined to the dominions of petty Rajahs, to whom the Moguls
had never extended their inva&s;ions. But as the nature of the com|merce

were permitted to erect &s;uch &s;light defences, as might protect the
per&s;ons of their Factors from the in&s;ults of invaders or in&s;urgents,
without rendering them formidable to the Empire.</P>
<P>MADRAS,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Madras.</NOTE> which commands the factories on the coa&s;t of Coro|mandel,
owed its origin to the gallantry of Sir William Langhorne;
who &s;ixed on a &s;terile and inconvenient &s;pot, merely on account of
its vicinity to the Portugue&s;e &s;ettlement of St. Thomas, where he
had a mi&s;tre&s;s. This injudicious choice was made, during the great

<P>BOMBAY,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Bombay.</NOTE> which has long pre&s;ided over the factories on the coa&s;t

fir&s;t arrival in Hindo&s;tan. Secured by the force which acquired it,
Bombay had &s;carcely any defences but the &s;ea, by which it was &s;ur|rounded.
Being a part of the portion a&s;&s;igned to the Infanta of
Portugal, when &s;he became Queen of England in 1662, it fell into
the hands of Charles II. in the end of 1663. That prince, finding
that it was not worth its expence to the State, transferred it, in fee|tail,
to the Company, about the year 1669.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Bengal.</NOTE> extending their commerce to Bengal, under the pa|tronage
of Boughton, a &s;urgeon, were permitted, about the year
1640, to build a kind of factory at Hughley, a port on the we&s;tern
branch of the Ganges. But &s;uch was the jealou&s;y of the Mogul
Government, that, for the &s;pace of forty years, the Company were
only allowed to retain thirty &s;oldiers and an en&s;ign in their pay, to
do honour to their principal agents. The war kindled by Sir John
Child, on the coa&s;t of Malabar, extending it&s;elf to Bengal, the
Engli&s;h were obliged to quit Hughley; and, &s;oon after, to retire to
Madras. Upon the pacification made in 1689, with the Court of
Delhi, the factory was permitted to return, fir&s;t to Soota-nutty, and
afterwards to &s;ettle at the village of Calcutta. Upon an in&s;urrection
of the Rajahs, on the we&s;tern &s;ide of the river Hughley, in the year
1696, the factory declared for the Mogul Government. The Nabob
of Bengal ordered them to defend them&s;elves again&s;t the enemy;

martial character of Ackbar had impre&s;&s;ed with &s;uch terror the
mind of Mubarick Shaw, king of Chandez, that in the year 1563
he paid homage at Mendu, the capital of Malava, which the emperor

In 1585, the brother of Murtiza Nizam, king of Golconda, flying

<P>The new city,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its depend|ence on the Mohamme|dans.</NOTE> becoming the capital, communicated its name to
the dominions of Bellaldeo; which, for &s;ome centuries, were di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
by the title of the empire of Bigenagur. When the Decan
was lo&s;t to the crown of Delhi in 1347, the dependence of the tri|butary
Rajahs pa&s;&s;ed to the new &s;overeignties, erected by the Mogul
mercenaries, who had revolted. The intermediate hi&s;tory of the
Carnatic, between the revolt and the middle of the &s;ixteenth cen|tury,
is involved in darkne&s;s, which has not hitherto been pene|trated.

and $eized the provinces along the coa&s;t of Coromandel. The war

It appears, however, that Aurungzebe had retained, during his reign,

was conquered by the kings of Bijapour and Golconda. When
Doo&s;t Ali acceded to the government, upon the death of his uncle
Sadatulla, his &s;on Sipadar Ali was arrived at man's e&s;tate; and, to

whom he owed his elevation<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Revolutions of Tanjore, MS.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The internal troubles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Naigs of Tanjore re|main long obedient to the Nabobs of Arcot.</NOTE> ari&s;ing from the&s;e di&s;puted &s;ucce&s;&s;ions, did

<P>The preceding chain of facts has,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Recapitula|tion of facts, relative to the ab&s;olute de|pendence of Tanjore,</NOTE> it is hoped, rendered more clear
a &s;ubject hitherto very imperfectly under&s;tood. It appears, that the
Mahommedans acquired that mo&s;t indi&s;putable of all rights, the
right of conque&s;t, in a regular and &s;olemn war, to the Carnatic and
its dependencies. That the province of Tanjore had always been
con&s;idered a divi&s;ion of the Carnatic, and an appendage or rather
a part of its &s;overeignty. That the Naigs of that country had been
originally the &s;ubjects of the kings of the Carnatic of the Indian
race. That their allegiance had been transferred, by a particular as
well as a general conque&s;t, to the kings of Golconda and Bijapour.
That the Moguls, as the conquerors of tho&s;e princes, acquired an
undoubted general title to all their claims of dominion, over their
dependents. That, in enforcing that title, they had acquired the &s;till
<PB N="61" REF="72">
more inconte&s;tible right of particular conque&s;t to the territory of Tan|jore.
That the pre&s;ent race of Rajahs obtained, by treachery, and not
by war, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that country, &s;everal years after the Moguls had
acquired a right of conque&s;t to the Carnatic and its dependencies.
That the &s;eizure of Tanjore by Ecko-j&icirc; was con&s;idered, as it actually
was, an inva&s;ion of the rights of the Moguls. That the emperor,
in a&s;&s;erting tho&s;e rights, &s;tript the &s;on of Ecko-j&icirc; of his govern|ment.
That his receiving back that government, upon the condi|tions
on which it was received, was e&s;tabli&s;hing a con&s;titution and
tenure, rendering him, his po&s;terity and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, va&s;&s;als of the
empire. That, by breaking the conditions upon which that con|&s;titution
and that tenure were founded, &s;ub&s;equent Rajahs had been
&s;ubjected to puni&s;hments, to fines and even to deprivation. That
they owed the continuance of their authority and government to
favourable accidents, and neither to any acquie&s;cence in their rights,
or opinion of their power.</P>
<P>It has,<NOTE PLACE="marg">on the empire of the Mo|guls.</NOTE> upon the whole, appeared, that the Rajahs of Tanjore of
the race of Ecko-j&icirc; were, in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word, feuda|tories,
liable to lo&s;e their territories to their &s;overeign, upon any
breach of their duty, as &s;ubjects. It has been &s;hewn, that the em|peror
of the Moguls was their undoubted &s;overeign, who governed
them through the medium of his deputy, the Nabob of the Carna|tic.
It has been proved, that the emperor po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed various and ir|refragable
titles to their allegiance. That he had been lord para|mount
of their territories, before they wre&s;ted them, by inju&s;tice
and treachery, from the hereditary Naig. That he had acquired a
fre&s;h right to their duty, as &s;ubjects, in a regular war, which ter|minated
in conque&s;t. That they them&s;elves had placed that right
beyond the power of cavil, in written te&s;timonies of their &startq;humi|liation,
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, penitence, and dejection.&endq; That, whil&s;t they
acknowledged the condition of &s;ubjects, they had performed their
<PB N="62" REF="73">
duty as &s;uch, without murmuring, for more than thirty years.
That, when they deviated from their obedience, they were deprived
of their lands, and even &s;ubjected to corporal puni&s;hment. That
they were &s;o far from a&s;&s;uming the &s;tate and independence of &s;ove|reignty,
that they &s;olicited and obtained, from the emperor, the
title of Rajah for their family; and that, by this act, they not only
acknowledged their dependence on the empire, but likewi&s;e, that,
neither by birth nor acqui&s;ition, they had any right to that dignity.</P>
<P>Such was the real &s;tate of Tanjore in the year 1744,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mogul government the only ac|knowledged and effective &s;overeignty in the Carnatic.</NOTE> though &s;ome
late writers, blinded by zeal, mi&s;led by faction, or &s;wayed by in|tere&s;t,
have erected that province into a kingdom, and encircled the
brows of its Naig with a crown. The truth is, that there was no
acknowledged, no effective, no independent, no &s;overeign power in
the Carnatic, at that time, except the Mogul, who had delegated
his authority,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anwar-ul-dien the legal repre&s;entative of that &s;ove|reignty.</NOTE> in a regular and legal manner, to the Nizam. That
viceroy, according to the con&s;titution of the empire, had inve&s;ted
Anwar-ul-dien, in the &s;ame regular and legal manner, with the go|vernment
of the province. All per&s;ons of every nation, and of
every degree, who held lands or pur&s;ued trade in that province,
were therefore &s;ubject to his authority, according to the tenures,
by which they held their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or the privileges, by which
they carried on their commerce. Being inve&s;ted with all the autho|rity
of the crown, the Nabob had a right to enforce the performance
of all the duties which &s;ubjects owe to the &s;overeign power; and,
in the execution of that high privilege, he naturally involved the
prerogative of making peace and war. Every ho&s;tility, committed
without his con&s;ent, mu&s;t, therefore, have been an act of rebellion.</P>
<P>The &s;ervants of the Ea&s;t-India Company had not yet extended
their ambition to the renown attainable by &s;eats of arms.<NOTE PLACE="marg">State and te|nure of the Engli&s;h Com|pany in that country.</NOTE> Confined
within the circle of a few miles of a &s;andy beach round Madras, the

they had been indulged with the privilege of forti&s;ying them&s;elves,
they had neglected that fir&s;t of all duties, &s;elf-defence. They had
works, but &s;uch as &s;eemed rather built by chance, than de&s;ign.
They had ba&s;tions, but they were placed contrary to all rule; and
the curtain was no better than a long, unflanked garden-wall<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Commodore Barnets Account.</NOTE>. Ill-provided
with implements of war, yet de&s;titute of &s;kill and even
courage to u&s;e the few they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, they naturally tru&s;ted their
protection to the Moguls, under who&s;e government they had lived
&s;o long in &s;ecurity. They, therefore, congratulated, with &s;incerity,
Anwar-ul-dien, on his arrival in his government. They prai&s;ed
his valour, celebrated his wi&s;dom, and hoped every thing from his
ju&s;tice; and they thought them&s;elves favoured by Almighty God,

<P>The intriguing abilities of M. Dupleix,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Re&s;lexions on the character and views of M. Dupleix.</NOTE> who governed for the
French Ea&s;t-India Company at Pondicherry, had already begun to
plan or to fore&s;ee the di&s;turbances, which &s;oon after followed, on the
coa&s;t of Coromandel. The circum&s;cribed circle of commerce was too
narrow for his talents, too confined for his ambition. Perceiving
the declining &s;tate of the empire of the Moguls, he wi&s;hed and
hoped for a &s;hare of its &s;poils. With a &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, which is
too often blended with good parts, he fore&s;aw no difficulties which
he thought he could not &s;urmount. Conver&s;ant in the character of
the Indians, he had imbibed their &s;pirit for management and in|trigue;
and, by combining the informations he had received from
various quarters, he hoped to obtain a principal influence in the
affairs of Hindo&s;tan. A de&s;ire to gratify his exce&s;&s;ive vanity had
tinctured his mind with avarice; and the vehement demands of his
ambition had unfettered his mind, from tho&s;e ties of &s;incerity and
honour, which bind more moderate men. But the pa&s;&s;ions, as well
as the talents of M. Dupleix, lay hitherto concealed within the walls

<P>The Nizam left five &s;ons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His family.</NOTE> &s;ome of whom inherited his talents,

<P>The languor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ra&s;hne&s;s of Lally breaks the treaty.</NOTE> with which his part of the treaty was executed by
Pretaupa Sing, inflamed the ira&s;cible &s;pirit of Lally, into a re|newal

the natural timidity of the Rajah into de&s;pair. He re&s;olved to de|fend
him&s;elf to the la&s;t extremity. He redoubled his &s;olicitations for
aid from Tritchinopoly. Captain Calliaud, who was no &s;tranger to

more troops in the Rajah's power, whil&s;t making engagements to
a&s;&s;i&s;t the French, in the reduction of Tritchinopoly<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Orme, vol. ii. p. 326.</NOTE>.&endq; But, being
convinced, from this la&s;t rupture, that the time of negociation was
pa&s;t, he detached on the 6th of Augu&s;t a con&s;iderable reinforcement
to Tanjore. Lally, having opened his batteries on the 2d, had on
the 7th made a breach in the wall.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He rai&s;es the &s;iege.</NOTE> But, having expended his am|munition,

induced the Briti&s;h to confine them&s;elves within their forts. The
Count de Lally, with all the intemperance and impatience of his
violent mind, quarrelled with his friends, whil&s;t he made rapid pre|parations
for attacking his enemies. His di&s;appointment, rather
than defeat, before Tanjore, had rou&s;ed his indignation, as having

had originally &s;prung from the &startq;adherence of the family of Anwar-ul-dien,
to their cau&s;e. Had the Nabob continued to ob&s;erve the

M. Dupleix would not, probably, have had recour&s;e to a pri&s;on at
Satarah, to rai&s;e a rival, for the government of the Carnatic. But
when Fort St. David was threatened, in March 1747, the Nabob,
&s;tudious to pre&s;erve the peace of the province, made preparations,
which plainly indicated his determined re&s;olution, to &s;upport the

of Anwar-ul-dien<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">V$de Dupleix's Letter to Naz$$ Jang.</NOTE>. Be that as it will, it is certain, that the pre|&s;ent

<P>When the French were inclo&s;ed within the bound-hedge of Pon|dicherry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nabob thinks &s;eri|ou&s;ly of an agreement between him and the Eng|li&s;h.</NOTE>
in 1760, the Nabob began &s;eriou&s;ly to think of forming
a new government, or rather a new con&s;titution, between him&s;elf
and his &s;ucce&s;sful allies. The ravages of the French, My&s;oreans
and Marattas; the public calamities in&s;eparable from a long &s;eries of
ho&s;tilities; the refractory conduct of Rajahs, Polygars and Kille|dars,
in not only with-holding their ju&s;t tribute, but even aiding the
enemies of the lawful government, had impoveri&s;hed the country,
and ruined the finances of the prince. The trea&s;ure of Anwar-ul-dien
had been long exhau&s;ted, by the misfortunes of his family.
The precarious revenue, irregularly collected, from &s;uch di&s;tricts, as
had not been entirely ruined, by the depredations, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by
the power of the enemy, had been expended, as &s;oon as received.
But the late defeat of the French, and the almo&s;t certain pro&s;pect of
their being driven entirely from the country, &s;eemed to promi&s;e
times of tranquillity and pro&s;perity, which, with proper manage|ment,
might &s;upply the wa&s;te made by a war of near fifteen years.</P>
<P>On the 13th of June 1760,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Terms of that agreement.</NOTE> the Nabob wrote a letter to Mr. Pigot,
the Company's Pre&s;ident at Madras, containing terms, which, though
le&s;s than his gratitude wi&s;hed to give<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Nabob's Papers, pa&s;&s;im.</NOTE>, were greater than his abili|ties.
His propo&s;itions were, that twenty-eight lacks of rupees,
charged upon the gro&s;s revenue of the Carnatic, &s;hould be paid <HI>per
annum</HI> to the Company, till his debts &s;hould be extingui&s;hed: That
this annual allowance &s;hould commence, on the 11th of July 1760:
That, be&s;ides the &s;um mentioned, which was to be paid at Madras,
<PB N="115" REF="128">
the Nabob &s;hould advance annually three lacks of rupees to the pay|ma&s;ter
at Tritchinopoly, &startq;for defraying the expence of the Com|pany's
people in that garri&s;on.&endq; That &s;hould Pondicherry be re|duced,
the whole money, due to the Company, &s;hould be paid, in
one year, provided the Engli&s;h &s;hould add a proper force to the
troops of the Nabob, to bring to account &s;uch va&s;&s;als of the Carna|tic,
as had with-held their tribute and allegiance, during the late
troubles<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pigot to the Nabob, June 23d, 1760. Nabob's Papers, vol. iii. p. 44, 45.</NOTE>. That, as the &s;um re&s;erved for the expences of his govern|ment
was the lea&s;t, to which tho&s;e expences could be reduced, he ex|pected,
in ca&s;e any of the di&s;tricts, between Nellore and Tinnevelly,
&s;hould either be lo&s;t to him&s;elf, or plundered by the French or Marat|tas,
the amount of &s;uch lo&s;s, being fairly and rea&s;onably &s;ettled, &s;hould
be deducted from the twenty-eight lacks, a&s;&s;igned to the Company.</P>
<P>In return for this large a&s;&s;ignment on his revenues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His demands on that ac|count</NOTE> the Nabob
declared, that he expected the Company were not to countenance
the refractorine&s;s of dependents, Killedars or Polygars. That the
Engli&s;h officers, in the different garri&s;ons, &s;hould not interfere in the
affairs of the country, nor the di&s;putes of the inhabitants. That the
Pre&s;idency &s;hould write to &s;uch chiefs as depended, by different te|nures,
on the Carnatic, announcing the pre&s;ent agreement. That
the Company &s;hould aid, upon requi&s;ition, the different renters, in

Nabob of the Carnatic and the Rajah of Tanjore. The quarrel was
not between two independent &s;tates. Had that even been the ca&s;e,
Mr. Pigot was neither an independent prince him&s;elf, nor the repre|&s;entative
of an independent &s;tate, to give him a colour of right to
interpo&s;e. The Rajah was a tributary, a feudatory, a va&s;&s;al, to the
Mogul empire; the Nabob was the deputy of that empire in the
Carnatic, the mediate power, to whom the Rajah was accountable,
for his duty to the throne. The Nabob, finding that the Rajah had
failed in that duty, had an undoubted right by his office, to require
the performance of the terms of his tenure. Should the Rajah's
ob&s;tinacy render ho&s;tility nece&s;&s;ary, it could not be called a war, but
a rebellion, on his part. Should even the demands, made by the
Nabob, have been unju&s;t, he was alone accountable for his conduct
to the emperor, his &s;overeign, and not to Mr. Pigot, who was him|&s;elf
an inferior &s;ubject to the Mogul. The truth is, the Nabob had
no right, &s;trictly &s;peaking, to dimini&s;h, either by treaty or com|promi&s;e,
the tribute or the feudal duties, which the Rajah owed
to the empire; and had he even con&s;ented to Mr. Pigot's me|diation,

right the Rajah had to &s;uch favourable conditions, they pleaded their
own inability to bring him to ju&s;tice, as their chief motive to the
treaty<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 83.</NOTE>. Their want of a &s;ufficient force, the expence of an expe|dition,
the danger of rai&s;ing other enemies, in ca&s;e of a rupture
with the Rajah, the incapacity of the Nabob to recover a &s;ingle ru|pee,
without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Company, were the arguments
produced, to ju&s;tify their conduct<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. But what nece&s;&s;ity was there,

<P>Such is the hi&s;tory of the treaty of 1762,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Recapitula|tion of facts, concerning the treaty of 1752.</NOTE> faithfully extracted from
the papers, which the Court of Directors have publi&s;hed, in ju&s;tifi|cation
of their own conduct. It has appeared, that the Pre&s;idency,
in&s;tead of aiding a friend and ally, in the recovery of his ju&s;t de|mands
upon a va&s;&s;al, depending on his government, &s;upported that
va&s;&s;al, in his refractory conduct, though he had uniformly acted,
during a long &s;eries of ho&s;tility and public calamity, an undutiful
part towards his &s;uperior and had been treacherous to them&s;elves.
That, when they ought to have made him pay his proportion of the
expences of a war, which protected him and his dominions, they
not only permitted him to &startq;&s;it rent-free<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pigot's expre&s;&s;ion, in his letter to the Rajah, dated Jan. 30th, 1762. Rous's Ap|pendix, p. 55.</NOTE>,&endq; but had reduced his cu&s;|tomary
tribute, to le&s;s than one-half of the &s;um u&s;ually paid, in the
mo&s;t regular and peaceable times. That, though he was bound, by
the nature of his tenure, as well as the laws of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, to
give his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the war, they allowed him to &s;et off again&s;t the
un&s;ettled arrears of his tribute, a kind of exemption, which he had
extorted from the Nabob in his di&s;tre&s;s; and that merely as an in|ducement
<PB N="130" REF="143">
to do his duty, which he otherwi&s;e refu&s;ed to perform. That,
when they &s;tripped &s;maller delinquents, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing equal rights
with him by the con&s;titution of the country, of their territories, and
deprived them of their liberty, they &s;oothed, flattered, and favoured
Pretaupa Sing, more guilty&mdash;but more wealthy than them all. That
the Pre&s;ident, either ignorant of the nature of his &s;tation, or a&s;&s;uming
powers, to which he had no title, had arbitrarily taken to him&s;elf
the office of mediator, without any authority from the parties, upon
who&s;e differences he was to decide. That, under this u&s;urped cha|racter,
he concluded a treaty, without either the communication or
con&s;ent of the Nabob; and that to give it validity, he had forcibly
&s;eized the chop of that prince, and affixed it to the paper, with his
own hand.</P>
<P>But though the treaty of 1762 was evidently forced upon the Na|bob,<NOTE PLACE="marg">General ob|&s;ervations.</NOTE>
as he afterwards acquie&s;ced under the terms, he was certainly
bound to pay attention to its due performance on his part<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XXII. p. 673.</NOTE>. This
circum&s;tance neither he him&s;elf, nor any who has e&s;pou&s;ed his cau&s;e,
has ever once denied. The treaty had but two objects, the liquida|tion
of pa&s;t arrears of Pei&s;hcui&s;h, and the &s;ettling the amount of
the future tribute. The very gentleman, who negociated the treaty
it&s;elf, has declared, that it &startq;related only to matters of account<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Du Pie's Vindication, p. 16.</NOTE>,&endq;
and could not &startq;preclude the Nabob from his con&s;titutional claims<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>&endq;
upon the Rajah of Tanjore, as a va&s;&s;al and dependent. The gua|rantee
of the Company went only to the point of Pei&s;hcui&s;h. &startq;If
there exi&s;ted in both, or either of the parties, any <HI>original, con|&s;titutional</HI>
RIGHTS, which were not the &s;ubject of the treaty, the
Company were not bound,&endq; they had no right, &startq;to interfere<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 11.</NOTE>.&endq;
But, &s;hould the Nabob demand a greater tribute than that &s;ettled by
the treaty, or the Rajah either neglect or refu&s;e to pay the &s;tipulated
<PB N="131" REF="144">
&s;um, then the Company, though they had arbitrarily con&s;tituted
them&s;elves umpires, were obliged to adhere to their <HI>own</HI> agreement,

<PB N="157" REF="170">
truth is, that the war had proceeded from the rooted re&s;entment of the
Subah again&s;t the Company, for their manner of &s;tripping him of
the northern provinces. The Nabob appealed to them&s;elves that this
was the ca&s;e; but, as they &s;eemed to think that his pre&s;ence might
be u&s;eful to their affairs, he promi&s;ed to join the army<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Sir John Lind&s;ay's Narrative, Oct. 13th, 1770.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The object of the Pre&s;idency,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their artifice to &s;ix upon him tho&s;e ex|pences.</NOTE> in &s;ending Mahommed Ali to the
camp, was to make a war, which the ambition of the Company had
kindled, the war of the Nabob; to furni&s;h a colour of ju&s;tice, for
their charging him with the expence. Though he was &s;en&s;ible of
their artifice, he thought it prudent to comply. He accordingly
joined the army; but the hands of the commanding officer being
tied up,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An inactive campaign.</NOTE> by the timidity and ignorance of field-deputies, the whole
&s;ummer of 1768 pa&s;&s;ed in inactivity and fruitle&s;s negociations for
peace. Though, by the original agreement, between the Nabob and
the Company it had been &s;tipulated, that no bu&s;ine&s;s with the coun|try
powers &s;hould be tran&s;acted, without his participation, the field|deputies,
at the in&s;tigation of Hyder's vackeel, excluded him from
having any &s;hare,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pre&s;idency wi&s;h for peace.</NOTE> in the conferences. But Hyder, being well in|formed,
that the Pre&s;idency wi&s;hed eagerly for peace, only amu&s;ed
their deputies, to &s;top the progre&s;s of the war; till the impatience
or terror of his enemies &s;hould enable him to dictate the terms.
Though he affected to wi&s;h, for an accommodation, he did not neg|lect
&s;uch ho&s;tilities, as promi&s;ed &s;ucce&s;s. He took the important fort
of Mulwaggle. He gained &s;ome advantages over Colonel Wood,
who had attempted in vain to take the place<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Though the&s;e ho&s;tilities might have convinced the Pre&s;idency at
Fort St. George,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hyder not &s;incere in his pacific propo|&s;als.</NOTE> and their deputies in the field, that Hyder meant
nothing le&s;s, than to negociate, on equal terms, they &s;till continued
in a manner to &s;olicit peace. The deputies, thinking that the pre|&s;ence
<PB N="158" REF="171">
of the Nabob impeded their negociations, pre&s;&s;ed him to re|turn
to Madras. The Nabob argued in vain, that his pre&s;ence in
the army would contribute to keep the Polygars and commanders of
forts &s;teady to the Engli&s;h intere&s;t. The Pre&s;idency, entering into
the views of their deputies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In&s;olence and inju&s;tice of the Pre&s;i|dency.</NOTE> COMMANDED him to return. They
had even threatened him with deprivation, in a letter to the field|deputies<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sir John Lind&s;ay's Narrative, Oct. 13th,

and, when he wrote to them complaining of this in&s;ult,
they refu&s;ed to receive his letter<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. He thought it prudent to return
to Madras; where he arrived, in the month of November 1768.
Colonel Donald Campbell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mi&s;manage|ments and misfortunes.</NOTE> a gallant and experienced officer, was ob|liged
to quit the field, on account of his health; and he was, &s;oon
after, followed by the field-deputies. All the&s;e things di&s;couraged
the army, and added &s;pirit to the enemy. Hyder attacked Colonel
Wood, plundered his baggage, and recovered all the conquered coun|tries,
except a few places of &s;trength. Thus ended the year 1768,

Carnatic have been &s;upported and their countries pre&s;erved to them
by the operations of our forces, employed in his cau&s;e, and that
nothing was more notorious, than that three former princes of
the Carnatic had received from the Tanjore Rajah &s;eventy, eighty,
nay, even one hundred lacks of rupees at a time; that to the pre|ceding
Nizam he had paid a contribution of fifty lacks; and the
pre&s;ent, if he had met with &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t our army, would not

bear &s;ome part of the expence of tho&s;e mea&s;ures, to which he
owes his &s;ecurity and the peace of his country! We, therefore,
enjoin you to give the Nabob &s;uch &s;upport in his preten&s;ions on
the Rajah of Tanjore, as may be effectual; and if the Rajah re|fu&s;es

negociators, weakne&s;s and deficiency as politicians. They affirm|ed,
that though they had ra&s;hly dared to rou&s;e the jealou&s;y of the
country powers, they had not di&s;covered, on trying occa&s;ions, the
becoming firmne&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the dignity of the Engli&s;h

<P>Proceeding from this general cen&s;ure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Full of indig|nation at the Rajah of Tanjore's being comprehend|ed in the treaty.</NOTE> they dwelt with particular
&s;everity on the article in the treaty with Hyder, which compre|hended,
at the recommendation, or rather at the command, of that
chief, the Rajah of Tanjore. &startq;Had you indeed obtained,&endq; &s;ay the

you &s;olicited; had he thereby drawn upon him&s;elf the re&s;ent|ment

to have appea&s;ed Hyder, there might have been &s;ome merit, in
procuring the Rajah &s;afe terms. But we do not conceive that
<PB N="169" REF="182">
Hyder has di&s;covered &s;o much want of penetration, in his tran&s;|actions
with you, as to warrant a &s;uppo&s;ition, that he could
him&s;elf be impo&s;ed upon by &s;uch an artifice; and his <HI>warm at|tachment</HI>
to the Rajah of Tanjore, manife&s;ted by &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;t|ing
he &s;hould be included in the treaty, could &s;carcely be un|known

whom they had reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of practi&s;ing arts of this
nature, it is not difficult to determine.&mdash;We cannot di&s;cern any
advantage gained, by this extraordinary effort of your &s;kill in
negociation, which you make matter of &s;o much merit. The
plain fact is, that the Rajah of Tanjore, who, as tributary to the
Nabob, <HI>ought</HI> to have furni&s;hed his quota towards carrying on
the war, which he has <HI>not</HI> done, is &s;till &s;tyled by you, a <HI>friend</HI>
to the Carnatic; and by Hyder's adherence to him, for <HI>refu&s;ing</HI>
to a&s;&s;i&s;t you, he is, as we conceive, effectually &s;heltered by the
faith of a treaty, from being compellable to contribute a &s;ingle
rupee,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pretend|ed u&s;pen&s;ion of the orders of 1769.</NOTE> towards defraying the expence of the war. Our former

<P>The concluding paragraph of the above quotation has been held

however, by the &s;ub&s;equent conduct of the Court of Di|rectors,
that they them&s;elves did not extend the meaning of their
own words to the pitch, to which they have been &s;ince wound

letter was received in July, ju&s;t four months after the pretended

paragraph, as revoking their orders of the 17th of March 1769,
&startq;the Directors never thought proper to take notice of the &s;ubject
directly or indirectly.&endq; The Pre&s;idency, therefore, had every
rea&s;on to con&s;ider the paragraph, which is now &s;et up as a revoca|tion

at the article of the treaty with Hyder, which, as they
conceived, oppo&s;ed the execution of tho&s;e orders. The truth is,
the part of the paragraph, which factious writers con&s;true into a

Nabob of Arcot, who had become an ally of the crown of Great Bri|tain,

the affairs of the Company at home, as well as their &s;ervants abroad,
had indu&s;triou&s;ly concealed, from that prince, the nature and im|port

&s;ecret was pre&s;erved, furni&s;hes an irrefragable proof, that every in|dividual
thought it his own intere&s;t, to keep the Nabob in a &s;tate

grievances were the only channels, through which he could convey
his complaints; and &s;elf-pre&s;ervation effectually prevented them,

giving offence to a body of men, who&s;e in&s;olence, tyranny, rigour

was near and &s;ure of &s;eizing every opportunity, to wreck their
re&s;entment upon an unfortunate man, who pre&s;umed to appeal
for protection, from the dictates of in&s;olence and the demands
of rapacity.</P>
<P>The event &s;hewed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The event &s;hewed his fears were ju&s;t.</NOTE> that the Nabob's fears were better founded
than the hopes of &s;upport pre&s;ented by the plenipotentiary. In a
government, &s;ubject to frequent changes of men and con&s;equently
liable to fluctuations in opinions, promi&s;es of protection are, at be&s;t,
but unintentional deceptions, which may lead the credulous into
ruin. This ob&s;ervation has actually been verified, in the per&s;on of
Mahommed Ali, Nabob of the Carnatic. The oppre&s;&s;ions of the
Company, the imperious rapacity of its &s;ervants, had forced him to
throw him&s;elf under the protection of the &s;tate. The &s;tate, in
<PB N="174" REF="187">
the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, promi&s;ed its protection; and, in the
per&s;on of an amba&s;&s;ador, ve&s;ted by the &s;eal of Great Bri|tain
with every legal power to pledge the public faith, a&s;|&s;ured
the Nabob, that it was only nece&s;&s;ary for him to &s;pecify
his grievances to have them redre&s;&s;ed. He accordingly &s;pecified
his grievances; but, after having been amu&s;ed during three years,
with the vain parade of an emba&s;&s;y, he found him&s;elf, in a much
wor&s;e condition than before. The royal commi&s;&s;ion was recalled,
without having accompli&s;hed the lea&s;t article of the avowed ob|ject,
for which it had been granted. The plighted faith of the
Crown was broken; the credit due to the great &s;eal of one of
the fir&s;t &s;tates in the world was de&s;troyed, at the requi&s;ition of a
body, who had tarni&s;hed the honour of a free nation, by in|numerable
acts of tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion. To this &s;ource may
be traced all the late misfortunes of the Nabob of the Carnatic.
Government, in&s;tead of fulfilling engagements, which every &s;tate
holds &s;acred, remanded back the wretched fugitive to the fetters,
from which he had attempted to e&s;cape. The Company enraged
at the PRESUMPTION of his defection, have added revenge to tho&s;e
&s;ordid and unju&s;tifiable pa&s;&s;ions, from which he had already &s;uf|fered
&s;o much; and with a peculiar refinement on cruelty, whil&s;t
they dive&s;t him of his rights, they deprive him of his reputation,

<P>The Nabob had &s;ufficient di&s;cernment to fore&s;ee a part of tho&s;e

Though that gentleman's rea&s;onings are not &s;o forcibly expre&s;&s;ed, in the following ab&s;tract, as in his own work, &s;ome advantage may be de|rived from their being compendiou&s;ly collected into one point of view. Whoever will be at the trouble of reading the ENORMOUS volumes publi&s;hed by the Court of Directors, in their own de&s;ence, will readily allow, that Mr. Du Pr&egrave; is, at lea&s;t, an IMPARTIAL authority, in whatever regards the intere&s;ts of the Nabob of Arcot. <HI>Sub&s;tance of Mr. Du Pr&egrave;'s Vindication, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The motives to the expedition of 1771 were partly in obedience to particular orders; partly to fulfil the guarantee of the treaty of 1762; but chiefly from ju&s;t apprechen&s;ions that the ge|neral peace of the Carnatic, and even the im|mediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Nabob and Company would be endangered, &s;hould not the power of the Rajah of Tanjore be checked.</P>
<P>The temporizing and deceitful conduct of the Rajah, in the My&s;ore war, had excited the re&s;entment of the Court of Directors. This they expre&s;s in very pointed terms, in their letters to Madras, of the 17th of March 1769. In the 7th paragraph of <HI>that</HI> to the Select Committee, after animadverting &s;everely on the conduct of the Rajah, for not contributing to the defence of the Carnatic, which he ought to have done as a tributary, they enjoin them to give the Nabob &s;uch &s;upport in his preten&s;ions on the Rajah, as he might think con&s;i&s;tent with the ju&s;tice and dignity of his govern|ment.</P>
<P>The&s;e orders were <HI>po&s;itive.</HI> But before the Committee had taken any mea&s;ures in con&s;e|quence of them, they had the mortification to find that the indignation of the Court of Direc|tors, &s;o lately expre&s;&s;ed again&s;t the Rajah of Tanjore, was transferred to them&s;elves. In the treaty with Hyder Ali, at the clo&s;e of the My&s;ore war, the Pre&s;ident and Council of Ma|dras had, for political rea&s;ons, included the Ra|jah, on the part of the Carnatic, though his conduct de&s;erved no attention to his intere&s;t. From their mi&s;taking the nature and extent of this tran&s;action, it was condemned by the Court of Directors, in terms full of acrimony and re|proach. In their letter to the Pre&s;ident and Council, of March 23, 1770, after &s;ome &s;ar|ca&s;tic ob&s;ervations on the &s;kill of their &s;ervants in negotiation, they &s;ay, that the King of Tan|jore, who, as tributary to the Nabob, ought to have furni&s;hed his quota towards carrying on the war, is effectually &s;heltered by the faith of a treaty from being compellable to contribute a &s;ingle rupee; and that, therefore, their former orders, relative to the King of Tanjore, were nece&s;&s;arily &s;u&s;pended, as being rendered utterly impo&s;&s;ible to be carried into execution.</P>
<P>The chagrin rather than the conviction of the Directors, relative to the con&s;equences of the treaty with Hyder, is evident. The Pre&s;idency, in their own vindication, wrote their &s;entiments very fully in their letter of January 31, 1770. They explained the motives of the war and peace with Hyder, and declared it as their opi|nion, that the &s;tipulation with re&s;pect to the Rajah could neither be an ob&s;tacle to the exe|cution of the orders of the 17th of March 1769, nor &s;helter him from any con&s;titutional claims of the Nabob for military &s;ervice or otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;ame &s;entiments were repeated at differ|ent times. If, therefore, the Court thought them inadmi&s;&s;ible, they ought to have &s;ignified their di&s;approbation, and thereby have prevent|ed the execution of orders which appeared to them incon&s;i&s;tent with the treaty. So far from that, however, they took no further notice of the matter. The Pre&s;idency, therefore, thought them&s;elves warranted, from the &s;ilence of the Company, to con&s;ider the orders of 1769 as &s;till &s;tanding in force, whenever the &s;ituation of affairs &s;hould demand their execution. They accordingly mentioned them in their di&s;patches of the 20th of July 1771, as one rea&s;on, among others, for calling the Rajah to account. Tho&s;e di&s;patches were received in England in January 1772; and the Court of Directors ap|proved of the conduct of their &s;ervants to that period.</P>
<P>From the&s;e circum&s;tances, it is &s;ubmitted, whether the Pre&s;idency had not rea&s;on to un|der&s;tand the &s;ilence of the Court of Directors as an acquie&s;cence in their explanations on that &s;ubject; and whether they judged ami&s;s in con|&s;idering the angry paragraph, which is now &s;et up as a revocation of the orders of 1769, to be rather a motive for their enforcement. The Court &s;ignify much di&s;plea&s;ure with their &s;er|vants for a certain article in their treaty with Hyder; but what they &s;ay is evidently more expre&s;&s;ive of their <HI>fears</HI> left that article &s;hould prove an ob&s;tacle to the execution of their for|mer orders, than of a <HI>wi&s;h</HI> that tho&s;e orders &s;hould be &s;u&s;pended. Were one permitted to hazard a conjecture, it might be &s;uppo&s;ed that there was not an intention to <HI>&s;u&s;pend,</HI> much le&s;s to <HI>revoke,</HI> tho&s;e orders, until the <HI>new</HI> arrange|ments for re&s;toring the Rajah in 1775 render|ed a di&s;approbation of <HI>old</HI> mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>With what colour of ju&s;tice, therefore, can the Court of Directors pa&s;s &s;o &s;evere a cen&s;ure upon their &s;ervants as to tell them that, in the expedition of 1771, they had departed from the letter and &s;pirit of the Company's orders? If the duplicity of the Rajah's conduct in the My|&s;ore war appeared to the Company in &s;uch a light, as to warrant the deci&s;ive orders which they had given to their &s;ervants in 1769; how much more forcibly did both the <HI>letter</HI> and <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of tho&s;e orders &s;peak, when the Rajah not only refu&s;ed to pay to the Nabob the ar|rears of a tribute &s;tipulated by the treaty of 1762, and for the performance of which the Company had made them&s;elves the guarantees; but when, at the &s;ame time, in defiance of all remon&s;trances, and in direct violation of the treaty with Hyder, he became an aggre&s;&s;or, and took up arms again&s;t the dependents of the Car|natic!</P>
<P>Had the treaty with Hyder &s;tipulated any thing in favour of the Rajah which could even be <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> to impede the execution of the or|ders of 1769, his following conduct plainly re|moved the ob&s;tacle. By a breach of the treaty, he forfeited all right to its benefits; and con&s;e|quently the orders, in&s;tead of being any longer <HI>doubtful,</HI> became in&s;tantly clear and deci&s;ive, and re&s;umed the &s;ame force and vigour as if no &s;uch treaty had ever exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>But the Pre&s;idency have no need to appeal to <HI>&s;uppo&s;itions,</HI> and the deductions ari&s;ing from them, in their own vindication. They can plead the expre&s;s declaration of the Company them&s;elves for the ju&s;tice of their proceedings. The Directors, in their letter to the Nabob of March 25, 1772, acknowledge, that the ra&s;h|ne&s;s of the Rajah in taking up arms again&s;t the Marawar and Nalcooty would, at all events, have urged them to un&s;heath the &s;word in or|der to cha&s;tife him, had the Nabob en&s;ured the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ources. When, therefore, the Nabob did <HI>en&s;ure</HI> the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ources, the expedition had their &s;anction.</P>
<P>Such was their own &s;en&s;e in 1772, of the principle upon which their &s;ervants had pro|ceeded in 1771. They avow the &s;pirit of the orders of 1769 in its fulle&s;t extent. Whatever, therefore, may be now alleged to invalidate tho&s;e orders, it is evident that a different mode of con&s;truction was not adopted till after that period. But the expedition of 1773 made a very material change in the &s;tate of the Carna|tic. That change of circum&s;tances &s;eems to have &s;ugge&s;ted a change of mea&s;ures; and, to ju&s;tify the <HI>new</HI> &s;y&s;tem, it became nece&s;&s;ary to condemn the old.</P>
<P>Enough, it is hoped, has been now produced, both from the records of the Company and their &s;ervants, to convince the impartial public that the expedition of 1771 was &s;trictly conformable to the orders of 1769. But there were other motives, be&s;ides an obedience to tho&s;e orders, which rendered that mea&s;ure not only expedient but even nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The Rajah of Tanjore refu&s;ed to pay the tribute &s;tipulated by the treaty of 1762, for which the Company were re&s;pon&s;ible; he would not contribute his quota towards the charges of the My&s;ore war; he had rebelliou&s;ly invaded the rights of other &s;ubjects of the Car|natic, by force of arms; and there were the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;ons to &s;u&s;pect, that he had been in negociation with the Marattas, Hyder, the Dutch, Danes, and French. From all the&s;e circum&s;tances collected together, the &s;ervants of the Company thought they &s;aw &s;ufficient cau&s;e, not only to be upon their guard, but even to make u&s;e of compul&s;ive mea&s;ures, &s;hould the refractory conduct of the Rajah continue to render them nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>They proceeded, however, with deliberation. Being aver&s;e to a deci&s;ion by arms, if it po&s;&s;ibly could be avoided, they fir&s;t had recour&s;e to le|nient methods. They remon&s;trated to him on the impropriety of his behaviour, and repre|&s;ented the con&s;equences to which it mu&s;t ex|po&s;e him. They promi&s;ed him the protection of the Company, as &s;oon as he &s;hewed that he de&s;erved it; but a&s;&s;ured him, at the &s;ame time, that a regular payment of the pei&s;hcui&s;h, and a &s;trict compliance, in all other re&s;pects, with the treaty of 1762, were the only conditions on which he could either hope to obtain their friend&s;hip, or even e&s;cape their re&s;entment. But nothing would do. Per&s;ua&s;ion and threats were equally employed in vain. The Rajah was not to be moved by the one, nor intimidated by the other. The former he treated either with contempt or neglect, and he &s;eemed to &s;et the latter at defiance; for he &s;ometimes carried the in&s;olence of his an&s;wers &s;o far as to exceed all bounds of forbearance.</P>
<P>Had the Rajah di&s;covered any &s;ymptoms of a conciliatory di&s;po&s;ition, there might have been hopes of an amicable accommodation. But his ob&s;tinate and contemptuous behaviour, not only precluded every expectation of that kind, but naturally gave ju&s;t alarm. It &s;eemed clearly to point out, that he had a dependence on foreign connections; as it was not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that he could rely on his own force alone again&s;t the united power of the Nabob and the Company. In &s;uch a &s;ituation, what were the &s;ervants of the Company to do? The &s;afety of the Carnatic was in imminent danger. The Nabob &s;olicited the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Com|pany, both as their own ally and as the ally of the Crown. The Company were bound to protect his government and rights; and the &s;ecurity of their own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions added weight to that obligation. As, therefore, no hopes of an accommodation were left, there remained no other alternative, but to reduce the power of the Rajah to &s;uch a degree as to be no longer dangerous.</P>
<P>Compelled by the&s;e con&s;iderations, the Com|mittee, at length, yielded to the Nabob's &s;oli|citations. He agreed to bear the expences of the war; and they, as auxiliaries, gave him the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Company's troops, to &s;upport the demands of his elde&s;t &s;on, who was &s;ent to Tritchinopoly, with powers to propo&s;e terms to the Rajah. He remained ob&s;tinate. His ca|pital was be&s;ieged; but, when the breach be|came almo&s;t practicable, he &s;ubmitted to the Nabob's propo&s;itions, and the army returned to Tritchinopoly.</P>
<P>It was ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, however, that this compromi&s;e would not be of long duration; at lea&s;t, on the part of the Rajah. Accordingly, fre&s;h differences &s;oon ari&s;ing between the Na|bob and him, a &s;econd expedition was under|taken again&s;t him in 1773, which ended in the total reduction of his country. In the letter of the Court of Directors of the 12th of April 1775, both expeditions have been much cen&s;ured, though the fir&s;t was once ap|proved. But, as the &s;ame principal &s;ervants were not in office at Fort St. George, at tho&s;e different periods, it is only to vindicate the ex|pedition of 1771 that the pre&s;ent ob&s;ervations are &s;ubmitted to the public. Tho&s;e gentle|men, who are chargeable for the &s;ucceeding mea&s;ures, can, no doubt, if nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ufficiently an&s;wer for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It is therefore to be hoped, that enough has been &s;aid to vindicate the government of Fort St. George, on that occa&s;ion. But, &s;hould any thing further be wanting, to &s;atisfy the mind of the reader, it is &s;upplied by the Court of Di|rectors them&s;elves, in their minute of the 18th of Augu&s;t 1773; wherein their Chairman, in their name, complimented the Governor on his return to England, in very high terms of ap|probation, for his wife and upright manage|ment of their affairs; for his good conduct to|wards their ally the Subah of the Carnatic; and, in particular, for his invariable regard to their orders in all ca&s;es.</P></NOTE>.&endq;</P>

<PB N="195" REF="208">
the French power had been annihilated on the coa&s;t. That, as allies,
auxiliaries, or mercenaries, they could acquire no inherent right to any
territory, they might over-run, to no fortre&s;s, they might &s;eize. That
the keeping po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Tanjore, which is a part of the Carnatic,
would have been a direct breach of the treaty of Paris, by which
Mahommed Ali is guaranteed in the entire and exclu&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of that country. That &s;hould it be granted, a conce&s;&s;ion which we
are, by no means, inclined to make, that Tanjore was <HI>not</HI> a part of
the Carnatic, yet, if conquered in a regular and &s;olemn war, it mu&s;t
have become &s;uch, as that war was the war of the Nabob, not the war
of his auxiliaries and mercenaries, the Company. That, as the Com|pany
neither were nor could be principals in ho&s;tilities, which might
terminate in the capture of Tanjore, their taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that
place for them&s;elves, or for any other than the Nabob, who was the
principal, would have been an act of private inju&s;tice, if not robbery,
puni&s;hable by the common law of the &s;tate, of which they are the
&s;ubjects. That, granting they may have had a right, in &s;ome ca&s;es, to
become principals in war in the Carnatic, they had evidently no &s;uch
right, in the pre&s;ent di&s;pute; for though the Rajah had broken the
treaty of 1762, by his refu&s;ing to pay, for the la&s;t two years, the &s;tipu|lated
pei&s;hcui&s;h, that treaty was not <HI>their</HI> treaty, and they had no right

from the month of February to September, proceeds thus,
in his letter to the Earl of Rochford: &startq;The country of Tanjore
was then, as I have been informed, unprepared. The fort was
unprovided with the means of defence, the Rajah's troops were
neither formed nor di&s;ciplined. On the contrary, the Company's
&s;ervants po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed plenty of &s;tores and ammunition; and an army
lay idle and inactive at Tritchinopoly, within a very &s;hort march
of Tanjore<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Sir Robert Harland to the Secretary of State, February 15th, 1772.</NOTE>.&endq; After &s;pecifying the unaccountable delays in un|dertaking
the expedition, the Plenipotentiary &s;tates the equally in|explicable
treaty, which terminated the war. &startq;The army was
thirty-&s;ix days before Tanjore. The walls were breached, and
di&s;po&s;itions made for &s;torming the place, when the whole was &s;et|tled
by negociation. The Nabob di&s;avowed his &s;hare in that ne|gociation.
The Governor was di&s;&s;atisfied. The Nabob's &s;on, in
his letters to his father, which I have read, &s;ays, that it was with
the advice, con&s;ent, knowledge, and approbation of the general,
he agreed to terms. The general, denying this charge, con|&s;iders

concerned in fru&s;trating the object of the expedition, Sir Robert

in a manner, rai&s;ed them from the rank of &s;ubjects, to that of rivals
to the crown. Their principal &s;ervants, con&s;cious of their own for|mer
con&s;equence, could not permit them&s;elves to be deprived of any
part of that con&s;equence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Intemperance in corre&s;pon|dence and con&s;ultations.</NOTE> without re&s;entment. This circum&s;tance
introduced a degree of intemperance into their con&s;ultations and
<PB N="207" REF="220">
corre&s;pondence; and gave birth to unnece&s;&s;ary complaints of
the conduct of the Nabob to their Superiors at home.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Complaints proceeding from jealou&s;y made the foundation of inju&s;tice.</NOTE> Tho&s;e com|plaints

pretexts of coercive mea&s;ures again&s;t the Nabob; which mea&s;ures
&s;prung, in fact, from an unforgiving jealou&s;y, and &s;elf-intere&s;ted mo|tives.
But the&s;e were the mea&s;ures of &s;ucceeding times. The Directors
of 1771, though they expre&s;&s;ed their jealou&s;y of the interference of the
crown, were &s;en&s;ible of the independent rights of the Nabob. In
their di&s;patch of the 10th of April, they u&s;ed the following remark|able
words:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Direc|tors own, that they have no right to in|terfere in the Nabob's af|fairs.</NOTE> &startq;We have no natural ally but the Nabob.&mdash;Our con|nection

they appear totally repugnant to our intere&s;ts, &s;o, on the other

to him: All we have, therefore, left, is to expo&s;tulate with him.
He mu&s;t determine for him&s;elf, and we for our&s;elves<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XVII. p. 401.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>In the pa&s;&s;age ju&s;t cited,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Yet jealous of the interfe|rence of the Crown.</NOTE> the Directors defined the limits of the
Company's power, with re&s;pect to the affairs of the Carnatic.
How a &s;ucceeding Court trampled down this fence &s;hall be, here|after,
both explained and expo&s;ed. The Directors of 1771, not|with&s;tanding
their moderation, with regard to the independent
rights of the Carnatic, were, at the very moment of writing their
opinion on that &s;ubject, &s;apping the foundation of tho&s;e rights, by
endeavouring to remove the &s;upport of the Crown from the Nabob.
They lamented,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They lament that a royal commi&s;&s;ion is &s;ent.</NOTE> that an unu&s;ual commi&s;&s;ion had been granted,
without any communication with them&s;elves; and con&s;equently
without previous &s;teps being taken, for the prevention of tho&s;e jea|lou&s;ies,
which might naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e from &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 403.</NOTE>.
Though they did not chu&s;e then to deny the <HI>right</HI> of
<PB N="208" REF="221">
the Crown to &s;end repre&s;entatives to its allies, they in&s;inuated, that
the rights and privileges of the Company re&s;ted upon as high autho|rity
as the King's commi&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XVII. p. 403.</NOTE>. The&s;e &s;entiments, expre&s;&s;ed to their
Servants, prove, that they had already made applications to Govern|ment,
for the redelivering the fugitive Nabob into the hands of his
former keepers.</P>
<P>In a country to&s;&s;ed by faction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections on the di&s;po&s;ition of govern|ment.</NOTE> and &s;tunned by clamour, mini&s;ters
de&s;titute of ambition, and fond of ea&s;e, too frequently become little
&s;olicitous, about the honour of the &s;tate. When the dog of di&s;content
growls at the door of the Cabinet, they throw to him a fragment of
the prerogative, as a &s;op, to procure his &s;ilence; and, with a pernici|ous
want of dignity, they hope to dimini&s;h their cares, by le&s;&s;ening
their authority. This torpid di&s;po&s;ition of mind is terrified at an ex|ten&s;ion
of power, as it is accompanied by an increa&s;e of labour; and in|formation
is di&s;agreeable and irk&s;ome, as it may bring on the trouble
of doing ju&s;tice. Each demand, for circum&s;cribing the con&s;equence
of the &s;tate and the rights of the crown, is heard by &s;uch men with
avidity, as every diminution of power contracts the circle of public
bu&s;ine&s;s. This ruinous &s;y&s;tem of frigid policy, they endeavour to im|po&s;e
upon the world under the name of moderation; but, by pro&s;e|cuting
it too far, the honour of the &s;tate is tarni&s;hed, and the pledged
faith of the &s;overeign violated.</P>
<P>The Ea&s;t-India Company might have felt this &s;elf-denying princi|ple
in government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ea&s;t-India Company had experienced the &s;elf-deny|ing principle of the &s;tate.</NOTE> almo&s;t during the whole of the pre&s;ent reign.
That Company had obtained countries, provinces, and kingdoms,
under the protection and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the power of the &s;tate. But go|vernment,
in&s;tead of a&s;&s;erting the State's claim of &s;overeignty, &s;eemed
afraid to que&s;tion the Company's rights; for fear the trouble of a
revenue of near &s;ix millions a year &s;hould fall into their own hands.
The anxiety of the Court of Directors, about a royal commi&s;&s;ion to
<PB N="209" REF="222">
Indian princes, was vain and &s;uperfluous. The &s;tate had permitted
them to ri&s;e from the rank of &s;ubjects to that of &s;overeigns, to hold
dominions more exten&s;ive, and &s;carcely le&s;s valuable, than its own;
to maintain an army more numerous than that of Great-Britain; to
appoint their relations, dependents and &s;ervants, to offices of more
power and emolument, than any in the gift of the Crown; to carry
in&s;olence and oppre&s;&s;ion to every quarter of A&s;ia; to dethrone
princes, and to inve&s;t mean per&s;ons with the pomp and authority of
royalty. It was, therefore, highly improbable, that a government
&s;o indulgent to the Company,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nabob de&s;erted by government, and delivered back to the Company.</NOTE> would refu&s;e one poor Nabob to his
former lords. It accordingly happened, that when the Directors
mu&s;tered &s;ufficient courage to demand the truant, the royal commi&s;|&s;ion
was immediately withdrawn; and he was delivered into their
hands, to be puni&s;hed for his credulity in the &s;upport of govern|ment,
as well as his defection from the authority of the Company.</P>
<P>But had the royal commi&s;&s;ion continued in India,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Royal com|mi&s;&s;ion nuga|tory.</NOTE> unle&s;s the pro|mi&s;e
of the Crown to redre&s;s grievances, and to draw clear lines be|tween
the power of the Nabob and that of the Company, had been
al&s;o performed, it was not worth the price of the &s;heep-&s;kin, on
which it was written. Though the managers of the affairs of the
Company,<NOTE PLACE="marg">yet alarms the Company,</NOTE> both in England and abroad, were at fir&s;t alarmed, they
&s;oon found, that a commi&s;&s;ion, neither &s;upported nor followed by an
enquiry, was no more than a paper-kite, &s;u&s;pended over their heads.
Unfortunately for the Nabob,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and deceives the Nabob.</NOTE> having been accu&s;tomed to the validity
of &s;eals in India, he repo&s;ed implicit confidence in the faith of that
of Great-Britain. This confidence was encouraged and confirmed,
by the paper-war, which was carried on between the plenipoten|tiaries
and the Pre&s;idency; for he was then to learn, that the autho|rity
of a king, to which his principles had annexed the idea of in|vincibility,
was de&s;tined to yield to that of trading &s;ubjects.</P>

&s;ubject to the Rajah of Tritchinopoly, long before the country fell
by conque&s;t into the hands of the Mahommedans. The &s;tate of
the &s;ubjection of the Marawars to the government of Tritchinopoly

a certain number of troops into the field, at their own ex|pence,
when their &s;uperior was engaged in war<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. No. XXVI. p. 941.</NOTE>. In ca&s;e of either

The Directors of 1773 had, in the mo&s;t public and deci&s;ive

in ju&s;tice nor propriety from that of 1773. They had thanked
Mr. Du Pr&egrave;, who had concerted and executed the mea&s;ure, for his
eminent &s;ervices to the Company, in every part of his conduct,
during his government, and, in particular, in his SUPPORT of the
rights of the Nabob. They had rewarded Mr. Ha&s;tings, who
had been Second in Council at Fort St. George, when the expedition
of 1771 was planned and executed, with the government of Ben|gal.
For near thirteen months after intelligence of taking Tanjore
was received, at the India-Hou&s;e, the Court of Directors, like their
predece&s;&s;ors in 1773, &s;eem to have entirely approved of the mea|&s;ure,

&s;tigmatized, and rever&s;ed not only the mea&s;ures of their pre|dece&s;&s;ors
but even their own. How and from whence this &s;udden
light fell on the India-Hou&s;e, and kindled in the minds of the
Directors, when their power was ju&s;t expiring, &s;uch a fervour

of their own want of every right to interfere, they acquie&s;ced
in a treaty, which they declared to be in&s;ecure; and withdrew their

which hopes to preclude rivals, by a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of its profits. When
&s;tates and kingdoms, by &s;carcely accountable revolutions, came un|der

The principal &s;ervants, having fabricated fortunes under a my&s;te|rious

peculation, inju&s;tice, and vice; to avoid the di&s;grace, which the

ears of the nation, and rouzed, in &s;ome degree, the attention of
government.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ob&s;ervations on parliamen|tary enquiries.</NOTE> The matter, when &s;et afloat in parliament, was to&s;&s;ed
and tumbled, with all that vehemence and indeci&s;ion, which are the
characteri&s;tics of numerous a&s;&s;emblies. A &s;ubject rude and without
form, exten&s;ive in it&s;elf, and rendered &s;till more intricate and per|plexed,
by tho&s;e who dreaded an enquiry, was not likely to receive
much light or benefit, from the de&s;ultory examination of men aver&s;e
to application and labour. Committees were appointed to interrogate
witne&s;&s;es, and to examine records. Much time was lo&s;t, but little
information gained.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A bill for the regulation of India affairs.</NOTE> A bill was, at length, introduced and pa&s;&s;ed,
which was &s;o much amended in its progre&s;s, that it fell &s;hort of its

Court of Directors.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The COAST left <HI>clear</HI> to the Directors.</NOTE> But the le&s;s fortunate coa&s;t of Coromandel was

<P>The principal di&s;covery made by the Committees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A permanency given to the members of that court,</NOTE> who examined
the affairs of India, was, in all appearance, conveyed to them, by
&s;ome members of the Court of Directors, who were di&s;plea&s;ed, at
the &s;hort duration of their own power. They repre&s;ented, that the
mi&s;managements abroad aro&s;e chiefly, from that di&s;regard to the or|ders
&s;ent from home, which had been naturally encouraged, by tho&s;e
&s;luctuations in men and opinions, which had &s;prung from a frequent
choice of Directors. To give permanency to the power of Directors,
was the only way to &s;ecure the obedience of Pre&s;idencies. This &s;ug|ge&s;tion
was &s;eized with eagerne&s;s, by men aver&s;e to the labour of an
<PB N="251" REF="266">
annual exertion of influence. Vainly imagining that gratitude was
a &s;tronger pa&s;&s;ion than fear, they hoped to gain by a favour, per&s;ons
whom that very favour placed beyond their controul. The perma|nency
&s;o much recommended and reque&s;ted was accordingly given
to the Court of Directors;<NOTE PLACE="marg">which, in&s;tead of amending, perpetuates error and ab|&s;ordity.</NOTE> but, in&s;tead of producing amendment, it
&s;erved to confirm, and perpetuate the old &s;y&s;tem, with all its errors
and ab&s;urdity. The Court became, at once, independent of Go|vernment
and the Proprietors.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The proprie|tors reduced to cyphers.</NOTE> The latter were, in fact, reduced to
mere cyphers, though they were &s;till amu&s;ed, with the yearly mockery
of voting for &s;ix Directors; who had actually &s;ecured their election,
by an agreement with the eighteen brethren, whom they had left
behind the bar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Directors elect them|&s;elves.</NOTE> the year before. Thus the Directors them&s;elves, like
the parliament of Paris, became their own electors; whil&s;t an im|provident

of mea&s;ures, which they could not prevent, and which were too
trouble&s;ome to be rever&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Court feeling their own independence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They think of turning their independence to advantage.</NOTE> began to think of the
means of turning it to the be&s;t advantage. The law, which had

The intrigues of Leadenhall-Street are frequently too dark to be

St. George, in the beginning of 1775, their nomination was rever&s;ed
by the Proprietors, by a &s;till &s;maller &s;uperiority of votes. The object
of the Company's choice was Lord Pigot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord Pigot.</NOTE> who, before he attained

Such parts of the conduct of Mr. Pigot, in that &s;tation, as &s;uited the

the misfortunes, which attended the latter part of Lord Pigot's life,

<P>Mr. Pigot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ri&s;e of Lord Pigot.</NOTE> having returned to Europe, &s;oon after the conclu|&s;ion

probably &s;ugge&s;ted this re&s;olution to his Lord&s;hip. The treaty of

and his va&s;&s;al the Rajah of Tanjore, had been, for various rea|&s;ons,
the favourite mea&s;ure of his former government. The vague
reports, concerning the deprivation of the Rajah, had been con|firmed
to his Lord&s;hip,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mondeo|Ki&s;tna wries a letter.</NOTE> by a letter from Moodoo-Ki&s;tna, a Duba&s;h,
who&s;e &s;teady friend&s;hip had remained unimpaired, during an ab&s;ence of

many years. This faithful Duba&s;h, having rented lands to a very
con&s;iderable amount from Tulja-j&icirc;<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Original Papers, vol. iii. p. 124.</NOTE>, lamented the fall of that
Rajah, with all the &s;incerity of a grateful tenant. In the warmth
of his zeal, he probably repre&s;ented to his noble friend, the ca&s;e of

<P>To his repre&s;entations of the inju&s;tice of the reduction of Tan|jore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His zeal car|ries him to the regions of fiction.</NOTE>
Moodoo-Ki&s;tna probably added tho&s;e reports of the cruelties of
the Nabob, which were indu&s;triou&s;ly circulated in the beginning of
1775, in Leadenhall-Street. It was alleged that Tulja-j&icirc; was clo&s;ely
confined in a dungeon at Tanjore; and, at the &s;ame time, that
he was in irons at Tritchinopoly.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rajah in a <HI>dungeon</HI> at Tanjore and in <HI>irons</HI> at Tritchinopo|ly at the &s;ame time.</NOTE> Though the&s;e two &s;tories could

annexed to the office remained unpaid. The Nabob, it &s;eems, had

to be given, where no &s;ervice is performed;&endq; and had con&s;e|quently
been UNPARDONABLY negligent, in his remittances.</P>
<P>Though a majority of the Court of Directors had voted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Lord|&s;hip's party pur&s;ue their victory.</NOTE> for an|other

The party, who had oppo&s;ed the nomination of Mr.
Rumbold, acquired credit and con&s;equently influence, by the deci|&s;ion
of the Proprietors, in favour of Lord Pigot. The event of the

to have appealed to a Government, who had &s;uffered a &s;ignal defeat,

framed, le&s;s con&s;i&s;tent with the former conduct of the Directors, than
&s;uitable to their pre&s;ent views. The&s;e views were &s;o powerful, in
their effect, that, in the pur&s;uit of them, all regard to matter of fact,

it, why was the treaty &s;ent to Tanjore, to be confirmed by the &s;igna|ture

for deviating from the treaty, what meaning do the Directors annex

<P>Although your Highne&s;s has, from the be|ginning, &s;hewed kindne&s;s to the Rajah; yet, without the lea&s;t forethought, he has given ear to the advice of &s;ome &s;ervants, and has failed to act conformably to your Highne&s;s's plea&s;ure, and &s;o has become guilty of a great fault; hence his affairs were thrown into confu&s;ion, and he now labours under bad con&s;equences.

Your Highne&s;s, in con&s;ideration of the friend&s;hip which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between you and the decea&s;ed Maha Rajah, has been plea&s;ed to pardon my fault, and to &s;end a letter to Nabob Madaur ul Mulk Bahauder, the contents of which he explained to me word by word, in which letter you have been plea&s;ed to &s;ignify very particularly your intention to protect me at all events, which did me great honour. It is now my re&s;olution to act in every re&s;pect con|formably to your Highne&s;s's plea&s;ure, that I may merit an increa&s;e of your favour from you day by day; your Highne&s;s is more dear to me in my e&s;teem than the decea&s;ed Maha Rajah was, for your Highne&s;s has manife&s;ted a greater degree of kindne&s;s than he ever did.

<P>I am a&s;toni&s;hed at what your Highne&s;s men|tions.

Carnatic was the only &s;pot left by the legi&s;lature to the management
of the leaders of the Company; and as the &s;oil is poor, it mu&s;t
be <HI>cultivated,</HI> to yield any thing of a good harve&s;t. An irritated
<PB N="266" REF="281">
Nabob, and a re&s;tored <HI>monarch,</HI> had a chance of creating an auction
for favour, which might be turned to a good account. Be&s;ides, it was
but equitable, at any rate, that as the State had got a <HI>Nabob</HI> on the
Coa&s;t, the Company &s;hould have a <HI>King</HI> to keep up &startq;the balance
of power<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>It has been ob&s;erved in a late publication, that if intere&s;ted views had influenced the late proceedings relative to Tanjore, the obvious arrangement would have been to &s;upport the Nabob, who had made large offers, public as well as private, and not the Rajah who was a mere pri&s;oner &s;tript of every re&s;ource, and con&s;equently could have no favours to confer.</P>
<P>A free examination of mea&s;ures, and not a di&s;&s;ection of party-mi&s;repre&s;entations, has been the object of our di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. There might be an indelicacy, perhaps, in any illu&s;ions to a corrupt influence, when it points to individuals. But when a public body, &s;uch as the India Company, acts with &s;o much &s;eeming incon|&s;i&s;tency and inju&s;tice, as to leave no explana|tion of their conduct but upon grounds of un|fair influence, the charge may be brought with more freedom, as being attended with pre|&s;umptions to e&s;tabli&s;h it&s;elf. The mi&s;con|duct of individuals may &s;ometimes be excu&s;ed, as proceeding more from error than de&s;ign. But the &s;ame indulgence cannot be allowed to large &s;ocieties of men; who&s;e mea&s;ures, from the greater variety of opinions upon which they are formed, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as the re|&s;ult of a more poi&s;ed and deliberate re&s;olu|tion.</P>
<P>To determine more clearly on the merits of the Court of Directors in this bu&s;ine&s;s, it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate a few facts, relative to the re|&s;pective &s;ituations of the Nabob and the Rajah at the time of transferring Tanjore to the latter.</P>
<P>1&s;t, The Nabob has declared, and the de|claration is known to be true, that, upon the reduction of Tanjore, he paid all the Rajah's debts to the Engli&s;h and others; and that he redeemed tho&s;e di&s;tricts of country, which the Rajah had &s;old or mortgaged to the Dutch. He, in the &s;ame manner, &s;ettled with the Danes about their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions at Tranquebar, as likewi&s;e with the French about their &s;ettle|ments of Carical. The&s;e are facts which can|not be controverted; and regular treaties, un|der the &s;anction of the Company, and that of the Plenipotentiary of Great Britain, were con|cluded between the Nabob and tho&s;e foreign powers, on the &s;ubject of their re&s;pective po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions in the Tanjore country.</P>
<P>2dly, But the di&s;bur&s;ements of the Nabob, at that period, were not con&s;ined to tho&s;e pur|po&s;es alone. Be&s;ides the payment of the Ra|jah's debts, and the redemption of the di&s;tricts which had been mortgaged, what was given as prize-money to the army, as well as the whole expence of a long campaign, mu&s;t be taken into the account. All the&s;e together amounted to an immen&s;e &s;um; and the money was bor|rowed, by the Nabob, from the inhabitants of Madras, and the country bankers or Souc&acirc;rs, at a very high rate of intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The advocates of the Rajah have a&s;&s;erted, that the&s;e loans were only a political manoeuvre of the Nabob to get the property of the coun|try into his own hands.</P>
<P>It is generally more ea&s;y to di&s;prove the a&s;|&s;ertions of party than to conquer their ob|&s;tinacy; for the &s;ame bold po&s;ition continues often to be advanced, when there is not even a colour of probability, to &s;upport it. In the pre|&s;ent in&s;tance, this is evidently the ca&s;e. If his adver&s;aries &s;peak truth, it was certainly a very extraordinary kind of policy in the Nabob, to borrow millions of Pagodas at an exorbitant in|tere&s;t, if there was no occa&s;ion for the loan. It was not certainly by a policy like this, that he could have ama&s;&s;ed the hidden &s;tores, which he has been &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s. But &s;o far were the Nabob's finances from being in the flouri&s;h|ing &s;tate repre&s;ented by his enemies, that, long before the Tanjore orders arrived, and even before they were thought of in Leadenhall|&s;treet, he was obliged, for want of money, to &s;ubmit to the daily clamours and in&s;ults of his Madras creditors; and the whole power of the Pre&s;idency was denounced again&s;t him, unle&s;s he a&s;&s;igned his country to di&s;charge their de|mands.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, and perhaps not without &s;ome foundation, that the Nabob him&s;elf once told a <HI>certain</HI> India Governor, who was &s;peak|ing of his &s;ecret wealth, that there was but one way of convincing the Engli&s;h of that matter, and that he was <HI>ready,</HI> if the Company and their &s;ervants <HI>approved</HI> of it, to give the Engli&s;h Parliament that conviction, which was to lay before them his receipts and <HI>particular</HI> di&s;|bur&s;ements &s;ince his acce&s;&s;ion to the Nabob|&s;hip. The officious Governor &s;eemed &s;tartled at &s;o unexpected a reply; and, for <HI>obvious</HI> rea&s;ons, no doubt, he was never heard to &s;ay any more upon that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>But to return to the public point in this af|fair. It is certain, when the orders for the re&s;toration of Tanjore arrived, that the revenues of the country, together with tho&s;e of the Carnatic, were a&s;&s;igned, by orders and mortgage, to the Nabob's different cre|ditors, and to the Souc&acirc;rs of the country. This is the common manner in which the princes of India anticipate their revenues. They borrow money, through the Souc&acirc;rs, up|on a&s;&s;ignments of the Government &s;hare of the crop and produce of the ground for the en&s;uing year; and it is wed known, how effectual is the validity of a Souc&acirc;r &s;ecurity to the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ors of the lands. Even a conqueror<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Orme upon Soucars.</NOTE> never attempts to invade or annu' it; as that would be de&s;troying the very <HI>medium</HI> by which his conque&s;t was to become u&s;eful to him&s;elf after|wards. We are &s;orry to ob&s;erve, however, that the very rever&s;e of that conduct, which would have been ob&s;erved by a conqueror, has taken place in the affair of Tanjore. The con&s;equence has been, that the Nabob, who was reduced be|fore to the utmo&s;t &s;tate of di&s;tre&s;s by his cre|ditors, was not only deprived of the be&s;t part of his dominions, but his credit, in rai&s;ing mo|ney upon the part that was le&s;t, was utterly de&s;troyed. For who would lend him upon any a&s;&s;ignments upon countries that might be wre&s;ted from him, in the &s;ame manner as Tan|jore had been? On the contrary, the nume|rous merchants and Souc&acirc;rs, who attended at the re&s;toration of Tanjore, &s;aw that the only real &s;ecurity in the country was that of the Rajah, who had many advantages on his &s;ide. He, at that time, had not a &s;hilling of debt; and, without being burdened with any of the expences of royalty, he was in&s;tantly put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of 800,000 l. a-year, out of which he only paid the Company 160,000 l. for their military charges. Be&s;ide all this income, the particular &s;ituation of his country, which &s;e|cured it again&s;t the incur&s;ions of an enemy, en|abled the Rajah to anticipate his revenues for not only the en&s;uing year, but for <HI>years</HI> there|after.</P>
<P>Thus, on the one hand, do we &s;ee the old and faithful ally of the Company, with whom their pro&s;perity began, and who, for his &s;ervices, was guaranteed by the treaty of Paris, ruited and de&s;erted by tho&s;e who ought to have &s;up|ported him, and le&s;t without money, credit, or re&s;ource; and that too at a time when he was loaded with a heavy debt of near<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Nabob's Tanjore debts, lately con&s;olidated, are near three millions, as appears by the Company's records.</NOTE>
<HI>four millions</HI> &s;terling to Engli&s;h &s;ubjects alone. But this is not all. In&s;ult has been added to mis&s;ortune; and, by an an uncommon wantonne&s;s of power, the Company have further charged that injured Prince with the pay and maintenance of tho&s;e very troops whom they had employed in de|priving him of his dominions. Oppre&s;&s;ed and borne down by &s;o many calamities, his Durbar became a &s;cene of mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s. His army, having large arrears due to them, muti|nied and &s;urrounded his palace. His own life and the lives of his family were in danger. And nothing was to be heard, in every quarter, but the threats of a tumultuous &s;oldiery, mingled with the clamours of creditors whom he could not &s;atisfy, and the cries of &s;ubjects whom he could not relieve.</P>
<P>On the other hand, we &s;ee the Rajah, a man, who, &s;o far from having ever rendered any &s;er|vice to this country, has always proved its mo&s;t determined and inveterate enemy; a man, who has long enjoyed, in the interior parts of the Carnatic, a perfect &s;ecurity derived from tho&s;e wars which have ruined his &s;uperior, and in which much of the blood of Britain has been &s;hed; a man, who never had an Engli&s;h gar|ri&s;on in any of his forts, who paid not a &s;hil|ling towards our expences, and in who&s;e good or bad fortune England has not an intere&s;t; and yet this very man, this Rajah, has been cheri&s;hed by the Company's favour, exalted by their power, and now triumphs in the &s;poils of his lawful ma&s;ter and &s;uperior.</P>
<P>Such are the outlines of the mea&s;ures which the Company have adopted, and of the con&s;e|quences which have en&s;ued; and &s;uch is a &s;aint &s;ketch of the merits and preten&s;ions of two men whom they have thought proper to treat in &s;o very different a manner. Can we behold &s;uch a &s;triking contra&s;t of characters and fortunes, with|out equal wonder and re&s;entment? Can we think on the authors of &s;o much unde&s;erved inju&s;tice on the one hand, and ill-placed &s;avour on the other, without an equal mixture of indignation and contempt? Or can we po&s;&s;ibly give any but one rea&s;on for a conduct &s;o diametrically oppo&s;ite to every principle of policy and vir|tue?</P>
<P>But the evil will cure it&s;elf. The Nabob's creditors for &s;o immen&s;e a &s;um, feel their own di&s;tre&s;s, and know who are its authors. The effects of their di&s;tre&s;s extend, with their con|nexions, to almo&s;t every corner of Great Bri|tain. They are entitled to redre&s;s; and it is the opinion of the be&s;t lawyers, that they can force it from the contrivers and managers of the or|ders for re&s;toring Tanjore.</P>
<P>From a moment's &s;urvey of the genuine &s;tate of facts we have here given, it will be ea&s;y to determine, on who&s;e &s;ide remained the power of procuring an unju&s;t influence in the Ea&s;t, that of the Nabob or the Rajah. But, if future proofs are wanted, they may be found, perhaps, in the zeal and amazing exertions which the Rajah's <HI>virtues</HI> have been able to create for him, in re&s;erve, in this country: while the cau&s;e of the Nabob, who has made the fortunes of thou&s;ands, both in his &s;ervice and by his genero&s;ity, has hardly an advocate to &s;tand up in his defence.</P>
<P>We will not, however, anticipate this &s;ub|ject; but hope that ju&s;tice will be effectually rendered to the Nabob, that his creditors may be &s;ecured; and even that the Rajah him&s;elf, in|&s;tead of his pre&s;ent mock royalty, may be placed on &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;ecurity, as may be mo&s;t &s;uited to his real rappine&s;s. In a word, we wi&s;h he may find the deputies of the India Company, in who&s;e hands he now is, as faithful guardians of his life and honour, as he found that very Nabob, again&s;t whom he has been made to complain, but who, during his power over him, contrary to the cu&s;tom of the Ea&s;t, &s;aved not only his life, but left him undi&s;turbed in his palace, with the mo&s;t ample allowances for his &s;upport.</P></NOTE>.&endq;</P>

The&s;e public-&s;pirited motives, joined to that humane &s;ympathy

&s;hall abide. To tho&s;e who may chu&s;e to examine the &s;ubject with
attention, it will appear extraordinary, that, amid&s;t all the u&s;urpa|tions
of the arms of the Company, the only conque&s;t made by the
orders of the Court of Directors, is that which they have cho&s;en to
&s;elect as an exhibition of their retributive ju&s;tice.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Signal <HI>virtue</HI> of the Direc|tors.</NOTE> Not &s;atisfied with

of their ravaging wars in India, they could produce but one in&s;tance
in which their SOVEREIGN, both by his plenipotentiary and per|&s;onal
approbation, had given a &s;anction to their ho&s;tilities. That
was the act which <HI>they</HI> thought the mo&s;t worthy of being &s;tigma|tized.<NOTE PLACE="marg">U&s;ual pro|gre&s;s of the Company's wars.</NOTE>
The u&s;ual progre&s;s of the Company, in their military tran&s;|actions,
had been to begin as allies, to grow into Duans, to con|clude
as u&s;urpers. In the bu&s;ine&s;s of Tanjore their conduct has
<PB N="270" REF="285">
been more my&s;terious, and of cour&s;e le&s;s &s;uitable to their common
principles. They began as guarantees, remon&s;trated as advi&s;ers,
aided as allies, fought and conquered as auxiliaries. In the cour&s;e
of a few years they affected to relent; and with peculiar feeling,
knowledge, and propriety, re&s;tored, as PRINCIPALS, what they
and their &s;ervants had been paid for reducing as MERCENARIES.</P>
<P>Where was the black chronicle of Indian deva&s;tations when the
Honourable Court began to relent? Had they,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their <HI>public virtue</HI> had va|rious oppor|tunities to be exerci&s;ed.</NOTE> in the hour of
affected &s;ympathy, thrown their eyes on the melancholy hi&s;tory of
the Company's ambition, they might find many acts more worthy
of being redre&s;&s;ed than the reduction of Tanjore; acts committed by
their &s;ervants, not executed by their OWN ORDERS. From the
banks of the Nirbidda, where the unfortunate Nabob of Broach
commenced his alliance and ruin under their au&s;pices: from the
Cri&s;tna to the mouths of the Ganges, a field fruitful in the SILENT
change and de&s;truction of Rajahs; from the mouths of the Ganges
to its &s;ource, a tract marked with the blood and wreck of Nabobs and
Rajahs; and blackened with the mo&s;t horrid treachery to the un|fortunate
Emperor, who&s;e &s;ervants they pro&s;e&s;s them&s;elves. In
all that exten&s;ive &s;cene of de&s;olation, was there no object that called
for redre&s;s, no Prince worthy of being re&s;tored, but the Rajah of
Tanjore, whom, for his own PERFIDY, they them&s;elves had
ordered to be cha&s;tifed? Perhaps not&mdash;where the Company act a

<P>But to do ju&s;tice to the Court of Directors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their real motives.</NOTE> let it be &s;uppo&s;ed for a
moment, that all the Nabobs, Rajahs, and Princes, over who&s;e
dominions the hand of ambitious rapacity has pa&s;&s;ed, are &s;till alive.
That the Nabob of Broach had an early claim upon the friend&s;hip
of any gentleman, or, if the Directors are fond of a title, any
NOBLEMAN, appointed to the government of Bombay. That &s;uch
gentleman or &s;uch nobleman had received a letter from India,
<PB N="271" REF="286">
de&s;cribing the &s;ituation of the Nabob; expre&s;&s;ing, at the &s;ame time,
his remembrance of pa&s;t favours and a&s;&s;urances of future gratitude.
Let it al&s;o be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the deprived Rajahs and Zemindars of
the northern Circars had &s;imilar claims on gentlemen, about to be
&s;ent from Leadenhall-&s;treet to be Chiefs in the&s;e provinces. That
the JAFFIERS, the SINGS, the COSSIMS, the SHAW ALLUMS,
along the banks of all the branches of the Ganges, had preten&s;ions
to the favour and hopes from the &s;upport of &s;ome old friends
preparing to embark for India as Governors in or near their
re&s;pective countries. In &s;uch an intelligible &s;ituation, who could
doubt the relentings of the leaders among the Directors, or the
RESTORING influence of the India-Hou&s;e cabinet? Who could
&s;u&s;pect their integrity, or who refu&s;e his applau&s;e to their PUBLIC
VIRTUE?</P>
<P>Should it unfortunately happen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Relative to Tanjore ex|plained.</NOTE> that the RESTORING Chief, or
Governor, &s;hould throw di&s;credit on that public virtue, by his capri|cious,
violent, and arbitrary conduct upon his arrival at the &s;cene
