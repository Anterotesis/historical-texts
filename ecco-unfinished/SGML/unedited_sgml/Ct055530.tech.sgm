<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<L>COrrupting Votes has &s;o prevail'd this Age,</L>
<L>That Bribery at length has reach'd the Stage;</L>
<L>And I, a Sacrifice, before am &s;ent,</L>
<L>Your Vengeance on the Poet to prevent.</L>
<L>Wit all the Year we give, and hope with Rea&s;on</L>
<L>Thin Food may pa&s;s in the Repenting Sea&s;on.</L>
<L>Our Author thence di&s;creetly took the Hint,</L>
<L>And now pre&s;ents a Play&mdash;with nothing in't:</L>
<L>But Trifles &s;till with you have mo&s;t Succe&s;s,</L>
<L>And ri&s;e in Value as in Emptine&s;s:</L>
<L>That Vnde&s;igning Thing they call a Beau,</L>
<L>The pretty Gentleman of Cringe and Bow;</L>
<L>None e'er believ'd the Ladies &s;trive to win him</L>
<L>For any thing, alas! that is within him.</L>
<L>But here the Scene &s;hou'd all its wants &s;upply,</L>
<L>For Wit is not the growth of <HI>Mu&s;covy:</HI></L>
<L>Tho', faith, of late &s;o flat your Ta&s;t is grown,</L>
<L>That <HI>Mo&s;co</HI> may refine upon this Town,</L>
<L>Where the rude Race mind Ornaments nor Fa&s;hion;</L>
<L>There's not a powder'd Wig in all the Nation;</L>
<L>No Fop nor Snuff-box there the Fair to move;</L>
<L>Their Women give 'em Ea&s;e, but never Love.</L>
<L><PB REF="3">
Yet $word$ rude Brea&s;t can always be &s;evere,</L>
<L>'Tis known how very civil one was here:</L>
<L>For his Sake then may this be not accurst;</L>
<L>We hope you'll find (if to his Name you're ju&s;t)</L>
<L>A Second <HI>Czar</HI> obliging as the Fir&s;t.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written <HI>by</HI> Mr. <HI>Burnaby.</HI></BYLINE>
<L>EXpect no fawning, Sirs! the Poet's Champion, I,</L>
<L>Have &s;worn to &s;tand, and every Judge defie.</L>
<L>But you the bull$ying Criticks I'll not name,</L>
<L>Judges, who&s;e only Bu&s;ine&s;s 'tis to damn.</L>
<L>Howe'er we thought you once, the wi&s;e and &s;trong;</L>
<L>Know we have born your Impotence too long.</L>
<L>You that above your Sires pre&s;ume to &s;oar,</L>
<L>And are but Copies daub'd in M$nature;</L>
<L>You that have nothing right in Heart or Tongue,</L>
<L>But only to be re&s;olute in Wrong;</L>
<L>Fal&s;e is your Wit and Judgment. Now I &s;wear</L>
<L>By all the Virgins of each Theatre,</L>
<L>The Poets for the future &s;hall not &s;tand</L>
<L>Like Shrovetide-Cocks, the Pault of every vulgar Hand:</L>
<L>Nor let the purblind Criticks Sentence pa&s;s,</L>
<L>That &s;ho$ts the Beauties through an Optick-gla&s;s;</L>
<L>Nor barbarous Noi&s;es from the Gallery come,</L>
<L>Nor Mask below to clap, or hi&s;s pre&s;ume:</L>
<L>Let the Mask cackle at the Fops that flout her,</L>
<L>Or cluck the Squires that hovering peep about her.</L>
<L>&mdash;For the great Dons of Wit,</L>
<L>To them is given full Privilege alone</L>
<L>To damn all others, and cry up their own.</L>
<L>The Ladies in their Eyes a killing Pow'r bear,</L>
<L>They can de&s;troy; but nobler 'tis to &s;pare</L>
<L>An humble Victim offer'd to the Fair.</L>

her Love &s;urmounted by her Pride, to be for&s;aken by him who
always had been dearer to her than Life and Empire; the Ar|tifice,
(for &s;o <HI>I</HI> now blieve it,) &s;ucceeded to his Wi&s;h, and &s;he
in Rage and Scorn of your Perfidy, promis'd a blind Obedi|ence
to her Father's Will; but did you &s;ee the Sadne&s;s of her
Soul amid&s;t her pompous Glories, you would not brand her
with Incon&s;tancy? For tho' &s;he hates and loaths your ba&s;e Di&s;|loyalty,

<P>Ob&s;erve me then: His Father's Name was <HI>Smyrna O|tropeia,</HI>
de&s;cended from an ancient Family of <HI>Gere&s;&s;au,</HI> who
for his voluptuous and vicious Life confin'd him to a Mona&s;tery
under my Tuition; where I, unhappy as I was, &s;purr'd his
Ambition, by often in&s;inuating to him, the Re&s;emblance he
bore to that <HI>Demetrius,</HI> who by Duke <HI>Boris</HI> Cruelty was &s;lain.
This in a pregnant working Genius, which he always had,
urg'd him to own him&s;elf to be the lawful and only &s;urviving
Heir of <HI>John Ba&s;ilovitz:</HI> He &s;oon after gain'd admittance into
the Family of the Patriarch, where being for a Fault cha|&s;tiz'd,
the fal&s;e <HI>Demetrius</HI> (weeping) told him, <HI>If he knew his
Birth, he wou'd not u&s;e him &s;o.</HI> The Patriarch pre&s;s'd him to
di&s;cover who he was. He did, and in &s;uch cunning and pa|thetick
Terms, as he who not &s;u&s;pecting Artifice, believ'd
him: The good Old Man, I &s;ay, affected with the Wrongs
he thought was done this fal&s;e <HI>Demetrius,</HI> promis'd his Prote|ction,
and gave him Countenance, which &s;oon reach'd to the
Ear of <HI>Boris,</HI> who from the Patriarch then demanded him:
He not having Force &s;ufficient to &s;upport his Intere&s;t, &s;ent
him to <HI>Sendomiria,</HI> where you my Lord <STAGE>[<HI>To</HI> Manz.]</STAGE> can tell
the Noble U&s;age which he there did meet, receiv'd by all as
