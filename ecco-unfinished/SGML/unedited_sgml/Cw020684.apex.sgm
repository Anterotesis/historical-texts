<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Celebrated Dean of St. Patrick's &s;ome|where ob&s;erves, that a man of talents no &s;ooner emerges from ob&s;curity than all the block|heads are in&s;tantly up in arms again&s;t him. Fully per&s;uaded of the truth of this ob&s;erva|tion, I &s;hould have been prepared for ho&s;tility, had I imagined my&s;elf a man of talents; but, knowing the contrary too well, I little expect|ed that the harmle&s;s e&s;&s;ays from my pen would have conjured up again&s;t me this numerous and &s;tupid ho&s;t. It is their misfortune, never to form a right conception of any per&s;on or thing, and therefore their abu&s;e is not always a cer|tain proof of merit in the object on which it is be&s;towed: their ignorance le&s;&s;ens the honour conferred by their envy, hatred and malice.</P>
<P>I have long been the butt of the &s;illy a&s;per|&s;ions of this grovelling tribe; <Q>but their &s;pite never di&s;covered it&s;elf in its deepe&s;t colours, till they &s;aw me, as they imagined, &startq;i&s;&s;ue from poverty to the appearance of better condi|tion.&endq;</Q> Then it was that their gall ran over, and jaundiced their whole countenances; then it was that the &s;tupide&s;t of all &s;tupid gazettes, that lewd and common &s;trumpet, the <HI>Aurora,</HI> became pregnant with the following <HI>ba&s;tard,</HI> as abundant in fal&s;ehood as any one that ever &s;prang from the Ioins of <HI>Poor Richard.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>"Mr. BACHE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><Q>&startq;As the people of America may not be informed who PETER PORCUPINE is, the celebrated manufacturer of <HI>lies,</HI> and retaile$ of <HI>filth,</HI> I will give you &s;ome little account o$ this pe&s;tiferous animal. This wretch was obliged to <HI>ab&s;cond</HI> from his darling <HI>Old Eng|land</HI> to avoid being turned off into the othe$ world before, what he &s;uppo&s;ed, his time&punc; It may be well imagined, that in a land o$ liberty and flowing with milk and honey, hi$ <HI>precipitate retreat</HI> could not have been owing to any offence committed again&s;t the govern|ment very honourable to him&s;elf. Gnawed by the worm that never dies, his own wretch|edne&s;s would ever prevent him from making any attempt in favour of human happine&s;s&punc; His u&s;ual occupation at home was that of a <HI>garret-&s;cribbler,</HI> excepting a little <HI>night-bu&s;i|ne&s;s</HI> occa&s;ionally, to &s;upply unavoidable ex|igencies; Grubb-&s;treet did not an&s;wer his purpo&s;es, and being &s;cented by certain tip|&s;ta&s;&s;s for &s;omething more than &s;cribbling, he took a <HI>French leave</HI> for France. His evil$ genius pur&s;ued him here, and <HI>as his finger$ were as long as ever,</HI> he was obliged as &s;ud|denly to leave the Republic, which has now
<PB N="5" REF="5">
drawn forth all his venom for her attempt to do him <HI>ju&s;tice.</HI> On his arrival in this coun|try, he figured &s;ome time as a <HI>pedagogue;</HI> but as this employment &s;carcely furni&s;hed him &s;alt to his porridge, he having been li|terally without hardly bread to eat, and not a &s;econd &s;hirt to his back,&endq;</Q> <Q>he re&s;umed his old &startq;occupation of &s;cribbling, having little chance of &s;ucce&s;s in the other employments which drove him to this country. His talent at <HI>lies</HI> and <HI>Billingsgate rhetoric,</HI> introduced him to the notice of a certain foreign agent, who was known during the Revolution by the name of <HI>traitor.</HI> This &s;aid agent has been &s;een to pay frequent vi&s;its to PETER. To atone for his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions in the mother country, as well as to get a little more bread to eat than he had been accu&s;tomed to, he enli&s;ted in the cau&s;e of his gracious Maje&s;ty. From the extreme of poverty and filth, he has &s;uddenly &s;prouted into at lea&s;t the ap|pearance of better condition; for he has tak|en a hou&s;e for the &s;ale of his large poi&s;on, at the enormous rent of <HI>twelve hundred dollars a year,</HI> and has <HI>paid a year's rent in advance!!</HI> The public will now be enabled to account for the overflowings of his gall again&s;t the Republic of France, and the Republicans of this country, as well as his devotion to the cau&s;e of tyranny and of Kings. From the frequency of vi&s;its paid him by the agent already mentioned, and his &s;udden change o&s; condition, <HI>&s;ecret &s;ervice-money</HI> mu&s;t have been liberally employed; for his zeal to make atonement to his mother country &s;eems
<PB N="6" REF="6">
proportioned to the magnitude of his of|fence, and the <HI>guineas</HI> advanced. As this <HI>fugitive felon</HI> has crept from his hole, his <HI>quills</HI> will now become harmle&s;s; for hither|to they have only excited apprehen&s;ion be|cau&s;e the bea&s;t who &s;hot them was conceal|ed. I have a number of anecdotes re&s;pect|ing him, that I will &s;oon trouble you with, for the amu&s;ement of the public. This &s;tate|ment will convince PETER, that I know him well, and that I have only di&s;clo&s;ed a&endq; part of the truth.</Q></P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>"PAUL HEDGEHOG."</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<P>This <HI>Paul Hedgehog</HI> I know nothing of. I can hardly &s;uppo&s;e that he is one of my cou|&s;ins at New-York: if he be, for the honour of our family, I hope that he is a ba&s;tard. But, let Paul be what he will, he is not the only one who has attempted to &s;ink me in the opinion of a public that has ever honoured my e&s;&s;ays with di&s;tingui&s;hed marks of approba|tion. I have been well informed, that it is currently reported, that Mr. Thomas Bradford, the Book-&s;eller, "put a coat upon my back," and that, when I was fir&s;t favoured with his patronage, I had not a "&s;econd &s;hirt to my "back."</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="7">
Were I to calculate upon the u&s;ual opera|tions of truth and gratitude, I &s;hould look up|on it as impo&s;&s;ible that in&s;inuations of this kind had ever been thrown out by Mr. Brad|ford, or any of his family; but, now-a-days, in this happy age of rea&s;on and liberty, we &s;ee &s;uch extraordinary things happen in the world, that to doubt, at lea&s;t, does not argue an exce&s;s of credulity or incredulity.</P>
<P>Let the propagators of all the&s;e fal&s;ehoods be who they may, I am much obliged to them for giving me this opportunity of publi&s;hing the Hi&s;tory of my Life and Adventures, a thing that I was determined to do, whenever a fair occa&s;ion offered, and which never could have been &s;o well timed as at the moment when I am &s;tepping into a &s;ituation, where I may probably continue for the re&s;t of my life.</P>
<P>I here remember well what I &s;aid in my <HI>Ob|&s;ervations on the Emigration of Doctor Prie&s;tley.</HI> <Q>&startq;No man has a right to pry into his neigh|bour's private concerns; and the opinions of every man are his private concerns, while he keeps them &s;o; that is to &s;ay, while they are confined to him&s;elf, his family and parti|cular friends; but, when he makes tho&s;e opi|nions public; when he once attempts to make converts, whether it be in religion, politics, or any thing el&s;e; when he once comes forward as a candidate for public ad|miration, e&s;teem or compa&s;&s;ion, his opinions, his principles, his motives, every action of
<PB N="8" REF="8">
his life, public or private, become the fair &s;ubject of public di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>This is a principle I laid down in the fir&s;t original page I ever wrote for the pre&s;s. On this principle it is, that I think my&s;elf ju&s;tifi|ed in the pre&s;ent publication, and that I am ready to approve of others for publi&s;hing what|ever they may know concerning me. Let them write on, till their old pens are worn to the &s;tump: let the devils &s;weat; let them fire their balls at my reputation, till the very pre&s;s cries out murder. If ever they hear me whine or complain, I will give them leave to fritter my carca&s;s and trail my guts along the &s;treet, as the French &s;ans-culottes did tho&s;e of Thomas Mauduit.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PETER PORCUPINE.</HEAD>
<P>TO be de&s;cended from an illu&s;trious fami|ly certainly reflects honour on any man, in &s;pite of the &s;ans-culotte principles of the pre&s;ent day. This is, however, an honour that I have no preten&s;ion to. All that I can boa&s;t of in my birth, is, that I was born in Old Eng|land; the country from whence came the men who explored and &s;ettled North America; the country of Penn, and of the father and mo|ther of General Wa&s;hington.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to my ance&s;tors, I &s;hall go no further back than my grand-father, and for this plain rea&s;on, that I never heard talk of any prior to him. He was a day-labourer, and I have heard my father &s;ay, that he worked for one farmer from the day of his marriage to
<PB N="10" REF="10">
that of his death, upwards of forty years. He died before I was born, but I have often &s;lept beneath the &s;ame roof that had &s;heltered him, and where his widow dwelt for &s;everal years af|ter his death. It was a little thatched cottage with a garden before the door. It had but two win|dows; a dam&s;on tree &s;haded one, and a clump of filberts the other. Here I and my brothers went every Chri&s;tmas and Whit&s;untide, to &s;pend a week or two, and torment the poor old woman with our noi&s;e and dilapidations. She u&s;ed to give us milk and bread for break|fa&s;t, an apple pudding for our dinner, and a piece of bread and chee&s;e for &s;upper. Her fire was made of turf, cut from the neighbour|ing heath, and her evening light was a ru&s;h dipped in grea&s;e.</P>
<P>How much better is it, thus to tell the naked truth, than to de&s;cend to &s;uch mi&s;erable &s;hifts as Doctor Franklin has had recour&s;e to, in or|der to per&s;uade people, that his fore-fathers were men of wealth and con&s;ideration. Not being able to refer his reader to the herald's office for proofs of the fame and antiquity of his family, he appeals to the etymology of his name, and points out a pa&s;&s;age in an ob&s;olete book, whence he has the con&s;cience to in&s;i&s;t on our concluding, that, in the Old Engli&s;h lan|guage, a <HI>Franklin</HI> meant a man of <HI>good reputa|tion and of con&s;equence.</HI> According to Doctor John&s;on, a Franklin was what we now call a gentleman's &s;teward or land-bailiff, a per&s;onage one degree above a bumbailiff, and that's all.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="11">
Every one will, I hope, have the goodne&s;s to believe, that my grandfather was no philo|&s;opher. Indeed he was not. He never made a lightning rod nor bottled up a &s;ingle quart of &s;un-&s;hine in the whole cour&s;e of his life. He was no almanac-maker, nor quack, nor chimney-doctor, nor &s;oap-boiler, nor amba&s;&s;a|dor, nor printer's devil: neither was he a de|i&s;t, and all his children were born in wedlock. The legacies he left, were, his &s;cythe, his reap|hook, and his flail; he bequeathed no old and irrecoverable debts to an ho&s;pital: he never <HI>cheated the poor during his life,</HI> nor <HI>mocked them in his death.</HI> He has, it is true, been &s;uffered to &s;leep quietly beneath the green-&s;ord; but, if his de&s;cendants cannot point to his &s;tatue over the door of a library, they have not the mor|tification to hear him daily accu&s;ed of having been a whorema&s;ter, a hypocrite and an in|fidel.</P>
<P>My father, when I was born, was a farmer. The reader will ea&s;ily believe, from the pover|ty of his parents, that he had received no ve|ry brilliant education: he was, however, learn|ed, for a man in his rank of life. When a little boy, he drove plough for two-pence a day, and the&s;e his earnings were appropriated to the expen&s;es of an evening &s;chool. What a village &s;chool-ma&s;ter could be expected to teach, he had learnt, and had be&s;ides con&s;iderably improved him&s;elf in &s;everal branches of the mathematicks. He under&s;tood land &s;urveying well, and was often cho&s;en to draw the plans of di&s;puted territory: in &s;hort, he had the re|putation
<PB N="12" REF="12">
of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing experience and under &s;tanding, which never fails, in England, t$ give a man in a country place, &s;ome littl$ weight with his neighbours. He was hone&s;t, in+du&s;trious, and frugal; it was not, therefore, won+derful, that he &s;hould be &s;ituated in a good farm, and happy in a wife of his own rank like him, beloved and re&s;pected.</P>
<P>So much for my ance&s;tors, from whom, i$ I derive no honour, I derive no &s;hame.</P>
<P>I had (and I hope I yet have) three bro+thers: the elde&s;t is a &s;hop-keeper, the &s;econ$ a farmer, and the younge&s;t, if alive, is in th$ &s;ervice of the Honourable Ea&s;t India company a private &s;oldier, perhaps, as I have been i$ the &s;ervice of the king. I was born on th$ ninth of March 1766: the exact age of m$ brothers I have forgotten, but I remember hav+ing heard my mother &s;ay, that there was bu$ three years and three quarters difference be+tween the age of the olde&s;t and that of th$ younge&s;t.</P>
<P>A father like ours, it will be readily &s;uppo$+ed did not &s;uffer us to eat the bread of idlene&s;$ I do not remember the time when I did n$ earn my living. My fir&s;t occupation was, dri$+ing the &s;mall birds from the turnip &s;eed, an$ the rooks from the peas. When I fir&s;t trudge a-field, with my wooden bottle and my &s;atch$$ &s;wung over my &s;houlders, I was hardly able climb the gates and &s;tiles, and, at the clo$$ of the day, to reach home was a ta&s;k of in$$+nite
<PB N="13" REF="13">
difficulty. My next employment was weed|ing wheat, and leading a &s;ingle hor&s;e at har|rowing barley. Hoeing peas followed, and hence I arrived at the honour of joining the reapers in harve&s;t, driving the team and hold|ing plough. We were all of us &s;trong and la|borious, and my father u&s;ed to boa&s;t, that he had four boys, the elde&s;t of whom was but fif|teen years old, who did as much work as any three men in the pari&s;h of Farnham. Hone&s;t pride, and happy days!</P>
<P>I have &s;ome faint recollection of going to &s;chool to an old woman, who, I believe, did not &s;ucceed in learning me my letters. In the winter evenings my father learnt us all to read and write, and gave us a pretty tolerable knowledge of arithmetic. Grammar he did not perfectly under&s;tand him&s;elf, and there|fore his endeavours to learn us that, nece&s;&s;ari|ly failed; for, though he thought he under&s;tood it, and though he made us get the rules by heart, we learnt nothing at all of the princi|ples.</P>
<P>Our religion was that of the Church of Eng|land, to which I have ever remained attach|ed; the more &s;o, perhaps, as it bears the name of my country. As my ance&s;tors were never per&s;ecuted for their religious opinions, they never had an opportunity of giving &s;uch a &s;in|gular proof of their faith as Doctor Franklin's grand$ather did, when he kept his Bible under the lid of a clo&s;e-&s;tool. (What a book-ca&s;e!) If I had been in the place of Doctor Franklin,
<PB N="14" REF="14">
I never would have related this ridiculous cir|cum&s;tance, e&s;pecially as it mu&s;t be con&s;trued into a boa&s;t of his grandfather's having an ex|traordinary degree of veneration for a book, which, it is well known, he him&s;elf <HI>durst</HI> not believe in.</P>
<P>As to politics, we were like the re&s;t of the country people in England; that is to &s;ay, we neither knew or thought any thing about the matter. The &s;houts of victory or the mur|murs at a defeat, would now-and-then break in upon our tranquillity for a moment; but I do not remember ever having &s;een a news-paper in the hou&s;e, and mo&s;t certainly that privation did not render us le&s;s indu&s;trious, happy or free.</P>
<P>After, however, the American war had con|tinued for &s;ome time, and the cau&s;e and nature of it began to be under&s;tood, or rather mi&s;un|der&s;tood, by the lower cla&s;&s;es of the people in England, we became a little better acquainted with &s;ubjects of this kind. It is well known, that the people were, as to numbers, nearly equally divided in their opinions concerning that war, and their wi&s;hes re&s;pecting the re&s;ult of it. My father was a partizan of the Ame|ricans: he u&s;ed frequently to di&s;pute on the &s;ubject with the gardener of a nobleman who lived near us. This was generally done with good humour, over a pot of our be&s;t ale; yet the di&s;putants &s;ometimes grew warm, and gave way to language that could not fail to attract our attention. My father was wor&s;ted without
<PB N="15" REF="15">
doubt, as he had for antagoni&s;t, a &s;hrewd and &s;en&s;ible old Scotchman, far his &s;uperior in political knowledge; but he pleaded before a partial audience: we thought there was but one wi&s;e man in the world, and that that one was our father. He who pleaded the cau&s;e of the Americans had an advantage, too, with young minds: he had only to repre&s;ent the king's troops as &s;ent to cut the throats of a peo|ple, our friends and relations, merely becau&s;e they would not &s;ubmit to oppre&s;&s;ion, and his cau&s;e was gained. Speaking to the pa&s;&s;ions is ever &s;ure to &s;ucceed on the uninformed.</P>
<P>Men of integrity are generally pretty ob&s;ti|nate in adhering to an opinion once adopted. Whether it was owing to this, or to the weak|ne&s;s of Mr. Martin's arguments, I will not pre|tend to &s;ay, but he never could make a convert of my father: he continued an American, and &s;o &s;taunch a one, that he would not have &s;uffered his be&s;t friend to drink &s;ucce&s;s to the king's arms at his table. I cannot give the reader a better idea of his ob&s;tinacy in this re&s;pect, and of the length to which this difference in &s;entiment was carried in England, than by relating the following in&s;tance.</P>
<P>My father u&s;ed to take one of us with him every year to the great hop-fair at Wey-Hill. The fair was held at Old Michaelmas-tide, and he journey was, to us, a &s;ort of reward for the abours of the &s;ummer. It happened to be my $$rn to go thither the very year that Long-I&s;land $$s taken by the Briti&s;h. A great company
<PB N="16" REF="16">
of hop-merchants and farmers were ju&s;t &s;itting down to &s;upper as the po&s;t arrived, bringing in the extraordinary Gazette which announced the victory. A hop-factor from London took the paper, placed his chair upon the table, and began to read with an audible voice. He wa$ oppo&s;ed, a di&s;pute en&s;ued, and my father re+tired, taking me by the hand, to another apart+ment, where we &s;upped with about a doze$ others of the &s;ame &s;entiments. Here Wa&s;hing+ton's health, and &s;ucce&s;s to the Americans were repeatedly toa&s;ted, and this was the fir$$ time, as far as I can recollect, that I ever hear$ the General's name mentioned. Little did then dream, that I &s;hould ever &s;ee the man and &s;till le&s;s that I &s;hould hear &s;ome of his ow$ countrymen reviling and execrating him.</P>
<P>Let not the reader imagine, that I wi&s;h t$ a&s;&s;ume any merit from this, perhaps mi&s;take$ prejudice of an honoured and beloved paren$ Whether he was right or wrong is not no$ worth talking about: that I had no opinion $$ my own is certain; for, had my father been $$ the other &s;ide, I &s;hould have been on the oth$$ &s;ide too, and &s;hould have looked upon th$ company I then made a part of as malco$|tents and rebels. <Q>I mention the&s;e circu$+&s;tances merely to &s;how that I was not &startq;nur&s;$ in the lap of ari&s;tocracy,&endq; and that I d$ not imbibe my principles, or prejudices, fro$ tho&s;e who were the advocates of blind &s;ubm$+&s;ion.</Q> If my father had any fault, it was $Word$ being &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive enough, and I am mu$$
<PB N="17" REF="17">
afraid my acquaintance have but too often di&s;|covered the &s;ame fault in his &s;on.</P>
<P>It would be as u&s;ele&s;s as unentertaining to dwell on the occupations and &s;ports of a coun|try boy; to lead the reader to fairs, cricket-matches and hare-hunts. I &s;hall therefore come at once to the epoch, when an accident hap|pened that gave that turn to my future life, which at la&s;t brought me to the United States.</P>
<P>Towards the autumn of 1782 I went to vi|&s;it a relation who lived in the neighbourhood of Port&s;mouth. From the top of Port&s;down, I, for the fir&s;t time, beheld the &s;ea, and no &s;oon|er did I behold it than I wi&s;hed to be a &s;ailor. I could never account for this &s;udden impul&s;e, nor can I now. Almo&s;t all Engli&s;h boys feel the &s;ame inclination: it would &s;eem that, like young ducks, in&s;tinct leads them to ru&s;h on the bo&s;om of the water.</P>
<P>But it was not the &s;ea alone that I &s;aw: the grand fleet was riding at anchor at Spithead. I had heard of the wooden walls of Old Eng|land: I had formed my ideas of a &s;hip and of a fleet; but, what I now beheld &s;o far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed what I had ever been able to form a conception of, that I &s;tood lo&s;t between a&s;toni&s;hment and admiration. I had heard talk of the glorious $eeds of our admirals and &s;ailors, of the defeat of the Spani&s;h Armada, and of all tho&s;e me|$orable combats that good and true Engli&s;h|men never &s;ail to relate to their children about
<PB N="18" REF="18">
a hundred times a year. The brave Rodne$ victories over our natural enemies, the Fren$ and Spaniards, had long been the theme our prai&s;e, and the burthen of our &s;ongs. T$$ &s;ight of the fleet brought all the&s;e into my min$ in confu&s;ed order, it is true, but with irre&s;i&s;$+ble force. My heart was inflated with nation pride. The &s;ailors were my countrymen, t$$ fleet belonged to my country, and &s;urely I ha$ my part in it, and in all its honours: yet, the honours I had not earned; I took to my&s;elf &s;ort of reproach for po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing what I had $Word$ right to, and re&s;olved to have a ju&s;t claim $ &s;haring in the hard&s;hips and the dangers.</P>
<P>I arrived at my uncle's late in the evenin$ with my mind full of my &s;ea-faring proje$ Though I had walked thirty miles during $Word$ day, and con&s;equently was well wearied, I fle$ not a moment. It was no &s;ooner day-light th$ I aro&s;e and walked down towards the old ca&s;$ on the beach of Spithead. For a &s;ixpen$ given to an invalid I got permi&s;&s;ion to go up the battlements: here I had a clo&s;er view $ the fleet, and at every look my impatience be on board increa&s;ed. In &s;hort, I went fro$ the ca&s;tle to Port&s;mouth, got into a boat, a$ was in a few minutes on board the Pega&s;us m$ of war, commanded by the Right Honou$$+ble George Berkley, brother to the Earl $ Berkley.</P>
<P>The Captain had more compa&s;&s;ion than generally met with in men of his profe&s;&s;io$ he repre&s;ented to me the toils I mu&s;t underg$
<PB N="19" REF="19">
and the puni&s;hment that the lea&s;t di&s;obedience or neglect would &s;ubject me to.

The things in which I had take the mo&s;t delight were neglected; the &s;inging $$ the birds grew in&s;ipid, and even the heart-chee$+ing cry of the hounds, after which I formerly u&s;e to fly from my work, bound o'er the fields, an$ da&s;h through the brakes and coppices, was hea$ with the mo&s;t torpid indifference. Still, ho$+ever, I remained at home till the followin$ &s;pring, when I quitted it, perhaps, for ever.</P>
<P>It was on the &s;ixth of May 1783, that like Don Quixotte, &s;allied forth to &s;eek a ventures. I was dre&s;&s;ed in my holiday cloth$ in order to accompany two or three la&s;&s;es Guildford fair. They were to a&s;&s;emble at hou&s;e about three miles from my home, wh$ I was to attend them; but, un&s;ortunately $ me, I had to cro&s;s the London turnpike road. T$ &s;tage-coach had ju&s;t turned the &s;ummit of a h$ and was rattling down towards me at a me$ rate. The notion of going to London ne$ entered my mind till this very moment, yet &s;tep was completely determined on, before coach came to the &s;pot where I &s;tood. U$ got, and was in London about nine o'cl$ in the evening.</P>
<P>It was by mere accident that I had mo$$ enough to defray the expen&s;es of this d$ Being rigged out for the fair, I had three
<PB N="21" REF="21">
four crown and half-crown pieces (which mo&s;t certainly I did not intend to &s;pend) be&s;ides a few &s;hillings and half-pence. This my little all, which I had been years in ama&s;&s;ing, melt|ed away, like &s;now before the &s;un, when touch|ed by the fingers of the inn-keepers and their waiters. In &s;hort, when I arrived at Ludgate-Hill, and had paid my fare, I had but about half a crown in my pocket.</P>
<P>By a commencement of that good luck, which has hitherto attended me through all the &s;itua|tions in which fortune has placed me, I was pre&s;erved from ruin. A gentleman, who was one of the pa&s;&s;engers in the &s;tage, fell into conver&s;ation with me at dinner, and he &s;oon learnt that I was going I knew not whither nor for what. This gentleman was a hop-merchant in the borough of Southwark, and, upon clo&s;|er inquiry, it appeared that he had often dealt with my father at Wey-Hill. He knew the danger I was in; he was him&s;elf a father, and he felt for my parents. His hou&s;e became my home, he wrote to my father, and endeavoured to prevail on me to obey his orders, which were to return immediately home. I am a&s;ham|ed to &s;ay that I was di&s;obedient. It was the fir&s;t time I had ever been &s;o, and I have repent|ed of it &s;rom that moment to this. Willingly would I have returned, But pride would not &s;uffer me to do it. I feared the &s;coffs of my acquaintances more than the real evils that threatened me.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="22">
My generous pre&s;erver, finding my ob&s;tina|cy not to be overcome, began to look out for an employment for me. He was preparing an adverti&s;ement for the news-paper, when an ac|quaintance of his, an attorney, called in to &s;ee him. He related my adventure to this gen|tleman, who&s;e name was Holland, and who, happening to want an under&s;trapping quill|driver, did me the honour to take me into his &s;ervice, and the next day &s;aw me perched up|on a great high &s;tool, in an ob&s;cure chamber in Gray's Inn, endeavouring to decypher the crabbed draughts of my employer.</P>
<P>I could write a good plain hand, but I could not read the pot-hooks and hangers of Mr. Holland. He was a month in learning me to copy without almo&s;t continual a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and even then I was of but little u&s;e to him; for, be&s;ides that I wrote a &s;nail's pace, my want of knowledge in orthography gave him infinite trouble: &s;o that, for the fir&s;t two months I was a dead weight upon his hands. Time, how|ever, rendered me u&s;eful, and Mr. Holland was plea&s;ed to tell me that he was very well &s;atisfied with me, ju&s;t at the very moment when I began to grow extremely di&s;&s;atisfied with him.</P>
<P>No part of my life has been totally unattended with plea&s;ure, except the eight or nine months I pa&s;&s;ed in Gray's Inn. The office (for &s;o the dungeon where I wrote was called) was &s;o dark, that, on cloudy days, we were obliged to burn candle. I worked like a galley-&s;lave from five
<PB N="23" REF="23">
in the morning till eight or nine at night, and &s;ometimes all night long. How many quarrels have I a&s;&s;i&s;ted to foment and perpetuate be|tween tho&s;e poor innocent fellows, John Doe and Richard Roe! How many times (God for|give me!) have I &s;et them to a&s;&s;ault each other with guns, &s;words, &s;taves and pitch-forks, and then brought them to an&s;wer for their mi&s;deeds before Our Sovereign Lord the King &s;eated in His Court of We&s;tmin&s;ter! When I think of the <HI>&s;aids</HI> and <HI>&s;oforths</HI> and the counts of tautolo|gy that I &s;cribbled over; when I think of tho&s;e &s;heets of &s;eventy-two words, and tho&s;e lines two inches a part, my brain turns. Gracious heaven! if I am doomed to be wretched, bury me beneath Iceland &s;nows, and let me feed on blubber; &s;tretch me under the burning line and deny me thy propitious dews; nay, if it be thy will, &s;uffocate me with the infected and pe&s;ti|lential air of a democratic club room; but &s;ave me from the de&s;k of an attorney!</P>
<P>Mr. Holland was but little in the chambers him&s;elf. He always went out to dinner, while I was left to be provided for by the <HI>Laundre&s;s,</HI> as he called her. Tho&s;e gentlemen of the law, who have re&s;ided in the Inns of court in London, know very well what a <HI>Laundre&s;s</HI> means. Ours was, I believe, the olde&s;t and uglie&s;t of the officious &s;i&s;terhood. She had age and experience enough to be Lady Abbe&s;s of all the nuns in all the convents of Iri&s;h-Town. It would be wronging the witch of Endor to compare her to this hag, who was the only $reature that deigned to enter into conver&s;a|tion
<PB N="24" REF="24">
with me. All except the name, I was in pri&s;on, and this Weird Si&s;ter was my keeper. Our chambers were, to me, what the &s;ubter|raneous cavern was to Gil Blas: his de&s;crip|tion of the Dame Leonarda exactly &s;uited my Laundre&s;s; nor were the profe&s;&s;ions, or rather the practice, of our ma&s;ters altogether di&s;|&s;imilar.</P>
<P>I never quitted this gloomy rece&s;s except on Sundays, when I u&s;ually took a walk to St. James's Park, to fea&s;t my eyes with the &s;ight of the trees, the gra&s;s, and the water. In one of the&s;e walks I happened to ca&s;t my eye on an adverti&s;ement, inviting all loyal young men, who had a mind to gain riches and glory, to repair to a certain rendezvous, where they might enter into His Maje&s;ty's marine &s;er|vice, and have the peculiar happine&s;s and ho|nour of being enrolled in the Chatham Divi&s;ion&punc; I was not ignorant enough to be the dupe o$ this mor&s;el of military bomba&s;t; but a chang$ was what I wanted: be&s;ides, I knew that ma|rines went to &s;ea, and my de&s;ire to be on tha$ element had rather increa&s;ed than dimini&s;he$ by my being penned up in London. In &s;hor$ I re&s;olved to join this glorious corps; and, t$ avoid all po&s;&s;ibility of being di&s;covered by m$ friends, I went down to Chatham and enli&s;te$ into the marines as I thought, but the ne$$ morning I found my&s;elf before a Captain of marching regiment. There was no retreating&punc; I had taken a &s;hilling to drink his Maje&s;ty health, and his further bounty was ready fo$ my reception.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="25">
When I told the Captain (who was an Iri&s;h|man, and who has &s;ince been an excellent friend to me), that I thought my&s;elf engaged in the marines: "By Ja&s;es, my lad," &s;aid he, "and you have had a narrow e&s;cape." He told me, that the regiment into which I had been &s;o happy as to enli&s;t was one of the old|e&s;t and bolde&s;t in the whole army, and that it was at that moment &s;erving in that fine, flou|ri&s;hing and plentiful country, Nova Scotia. He dwelt long on the beauties and riches of this terre&s;trial Paradi&s;e, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me, per|fectly enchanted with the pro&s;pect of a voyage thither.</P>
<P>I enli&s;ted early in 1784, and, as peace had then taken place, no great ha&s;te was made to &s;end recruits off to their regiments. I remained upwards of a year at Chatham, during which time I was employed in learning my exerci&s;e, and taking my tour in the duty of the garri&s;on. My lei&s;ure time, which was a very con&s;iderable portion of the twenty-four hours, was &s;pent, not in the di&s;&s;ipations com|mon to &s;uch a way of life, but in reading and &s;tudy. In the cour&s;e of this year I learnt more than I had ever done before. I &s;ub&s;cribed to a circulating library at Brompton, the greate&s;t part of the books in which I read more than once over. The library was not very con&s;i|derable, it is true, nor in my reading was I di|rected by any degree of ta&s;te or choice. Novels, plays, hi&s;tory, poetry, all were read, and nearly with equal avidity.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="26">
Such a cour&s;e of reading could be attended with but little profit: it was &s;kimming over the &s;urface of every thing. One branch of learn|ing, however, I went to the bottom with, and that the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential branch too, the gram|mar of my mother tongue. I had experienced the want of a knowledge of grammar during my &s;tay with Mr. Holland; but it is very pro|bable that I never &s;hould have thought of en|countering the &s;tudy of it, had not accident placed me under a man who&s;e friend&s;hip ex|tended beyond his intere&s;t. Writing a fair hand procured me the honour of being copyi&s;t to Colonel Debieg, the commandant of the garri&s;on. I tran&s;cribed the famous corre&s;pond|ence between him and the Duke of Richmond&punc; which ended in the good and gallant old Colo|nel being &s;tripped of the reward, be&s;towed on him for his long and meritorious &s;ervitude.</P>
<P>Being totally ignorant of the rules of gram|mar, I nece&s;&s;arily made many mi&s;takes in copying, becau&s;e no one can copy letter by letter, nor even word by word. The Colone$ &s;aw my deficiency, and &s;trongly recommende$ &s;tudy. He enforced his advice with a &s;ort o$ injunction, and with a promi&s;e of reward i$ ca&s;e of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>I procured me a Lowth's grammar, and ap+plied my&s;elf to the &s;tudy of it with uncea&s;i$ a&s;&s;iduity, and not without &s;ome profit; fo$ though it was a con&s;iderable time before I &s;ull comprehended all that I read, &s;till I read an$ &s;tudied with &s;uch unremitted attention, that,
<PB N="27" REF="27">
la&s;t, I could write without falling into any very gro&s;s errors. The pains I took cannot be de|&s;cribed: I wrote the whole grammar out two or three times; I got it by heart; I repeated it every morning and every evening, and, when on guard, I impo&s;ed on my&s;elf the ta&s;k of &s;ay|ing it all over once every time I was po&s;ted &s;entinel. To this exerci&s;e of my memory I a&s;cribe the retentivene&s;s of which I have &s;ince found it capable, and to the &s;ucce&s;s with which it was attended, I a&s;cribe the per&s;everance that has led to the acquirement of the little learning of which I am ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>This &s;tudy was, too, attended with another advantage: it kept me out of mi&s;chief. I was always &s;ober, and regular in my attendance; and, not being a clum&s;y fellow, I met with none of tho&s;e reproofs, which di&s;gu&s;t &s;o many young men with the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>There is no &s;ituation where merit is &s;o &s;ure to meet with reward as in a well di&s;ciplined army. Tho&s;e who command are obliged to reward it &s;or their own ea&s;e and credit. I was &s;oon rai&s;ed to the rank of Corporal, a rank, which, however contemptible it may appear in &s;ome people's eyes, brought me in a clear two-pence <HI>per diem,</HI> and put a very clever wor&s;ted knot upon my &s;houlder too. Don't you laugh now, Mr. Swanwick; a wor&s;ted knot is a much more honourable mark of di&s;tinction than a <HI>Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e badge;</HI> though, I con&s;e&s;s, the king mu&s;t have &s;uch people as Tide-waiters as well as Corporals.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="28">
As promotion began to dawn, I grew impa|tient to get to my regiment, where I expected &s;oon to ba&s;k under the rays of Royal favour. The happy day of departure at la&s;t came: we &s;et &s;ail from Grave&s;end, and, after a &s;hort and plea|&s;ant pa&s;&s;age, arrived at Hallifax in Nova Scotia. When I fir&s;t beheld the barren, not to &s;ay hide|ous, rocks at the entrance of the harbour, I be|gan to fear that the ma&s;ter of the ve&s;&s;el had mi&s;taken his way; for I could perceive no|thing of that fertility that my good recruiting Captain had dwelt on with &s;o much delight.</P>
<P>Nova Scotia had no other charm for me than that of novelty. Every thing I &s;aw was new: bogs, rocks and &s;tumps, mu&s;quitoes and bull-frogs. Thou&s;ands of Captains and Colo|nels without &s;oldiers, and of 'Squires without &s;tockings or &s;hoes. In England, I had never thought of approaching a 'Squire without a mo&s;t re&s;pectful bow; but, in this new world though I was but a Corporal, I often ordered a 'Squire to bring me a gla&s;s of grog, and even to take care of my knap&s;ack.</P>
<P>We &s;taid but a few weeks in Nova Scotia being ordered to St. John's, in the Province o$ New Brun&s;wick. Here, and at other places i$ the &s;ame Province, we remained till the mont$ of September, 1791, when the regiment wa$ relieved, and &s;ent home.</P>

People may &s;ay what they plea&s;e about the mi&s;ery of the French pea&s;antry, under the old government; I have conver&s;ed with thou&s;ands of them, not ten among whom did not regret the change.

<P>My determination to &s;ettle in the United States was formed before I went to France, and even before I quitted the army. A de&s;ire of &s;eeing a country, &s;o long the theatre of a war of which I had heard and read &s;o much; the flattering picture given of it by Raynal; and, above all, an inclination for &s;eeing the world, led me to this determination. It would look a little like coaxing for me to &s;ay, that I had im|bibed principles of republicani&s;m, and that I was ambitious to become a citizen of a free &s;tate, but this was really the ca&s;e. I thought that men enjoyed here a greater degree of li|berty than in England; and this, if not the principal rea&s;on, was at lea&s;t one, for my coming to this country.</P>

<P>I will ju&s;t ob&s;erve on this letter, that it was $$ankfully received, and that, had I &s;tood in $Word$ of Mr. Jeffer&s;on's &s;ervices, I &s;hould have $$plied to him; but as that did not appear $Word$ to be the ca&s;e, I wrote him a letter &s;ome $ months afterwards, reque&s;ting him to a&s;&s;i&s;t $Word$ man, the bearer of it, and telling him
<PB N="36" REF="36">
that I &s;hould look upon the a&s;&s;i&s;tance as given to my&s;elf. I dare &s;ay he complied with my reque&s;t, for the per&s;on recommended was i$ deep di&s;tre&s;s, and a <HI>Frenchman.</HI></P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the authenticity of this lette$ there can be no doubt. I have &s;hown the ori+ginal, as well as tho&s;e of the other document here tran&s;cribed, to more than fifty gentleme$ of the city of Philadelphia, and they may, $Word$ any time, be &s;een by any per&s;on of credit, wh$ wi&s;hes a &s;ight of them. Nor have I confine$ the peru&s;al of them to tho&s;e who have the mi$+fortune to be deemed ari&s;tocrats. Among pe$+&s;ons of di&s;tant places, I have &s;hown them $Word$ Mr. <HI>Ketlatas</HI> of New York, who, I mu&s;t $Word$ him the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, had the candour to e$+pre&s;s a becoming dete&s;tation of the ba&s;e c$$throat author of the threatening letter &s;ent $Word$ Mr. Oldden.</P>
<P>I have now brought my&s;elf to the Unit$$ States, and have enabled the reader to jud$$ of me &s;o far. <Q>It remains for me to negati$$ two a&s;&s;ertions which apply to my authori$$ tran&s;actions: the one is, that &startq;Mr. Bradfo$$ <HI>put a coat upon my back;&endq;</HI></Q> <Q>and the other, t$$ I am, or have been, &startq;in the pay of a Briti$$ Agent.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>In the month of July, 1794, the &s;am$ Unitarian Doctor, &s;ellow of the <HI>Royal</HI> Socie$$ London, <HI>citizen</HI> of France, and delegate $Word$ the <HI>Grande Convention Nationale</HI> of notori$$ memory, landed at New-York. His landi$$
<PB N="37" REF="37">
was nothing to me, nor to any body el&s;e; but the ful&s;ome and con&s;equential addre&s;&s;es, &s;ent him by the pretended patriots, and his canting replies, at once calculated to flatter the peo|ple here, and to degrade his country and mine, was &s;omething to me. It was my bu&s;ine&s;s, and the bu&s;ine&s;s of every man who thinks that truth ought to be oppo&s;ed to malice and hy|pocri&s;y.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> on the Emigration of this "martyr to the cau&s;e of liberty" were ready for the pre&s;s, I did not, at fir&s;t, offer them to Mr. Bradford. I knew him to retain a rooted hatred again&s;t Great con|cluded, that his principles would prevent him from being in&s;trumental in the publication of any thing that tended to unveil one of its mo&s;t bitter enemies. I therefore addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to Mr. Carey. This was, to make u&s;e of a culinary figure, jumping out of the frying-pan into the fire. Mr. Carey received me as book|&s;ellers generally receive authors (I mean au|thors whom they hope to get but little by): he looked at the title from top to bottom, and then at me from head to foot.&mdash;"No, <HI>my lad,"</HI> &s;ays he, "I don't think it will &s;uit"<HI>&mdash;My lad!&mdash;</HI>God in heaven forgive me! I believe that, at that moment, I wi&s;hed for another yellow fever to &s;trike the city; not to de&s;troy the inhabi|tants, but to furni&s;h me too with <HI>the &s;ubject of a pamphlet,</HI> that might make me rich.&mdash;Mr. Carey has &s;old hundreds of the <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> &s;ince that time, and therefore, I dare &s;ay he highly approved of them, when he came to a
<PB N="38" REF="38">
peru&s;al. At any rate, I mu&s;t not forget to &s;ay, that he behaved honourably in the bu&s;ine&s;s; for, he promi&s;ed not to make known the au|thor, and he certainly kept his word, or the di&s;covery would not have been re&s;erved for the mouth of June, 1796. This circum&s;tance, con|&s;idering Mr. Carey's politics, is greatly to his honour, and has almo&s;t wiped from my me|mory that contumelious <HI>"my lad."</HI></P>
<P>From Mr. Carey I went to Mr. Bradford, and left the pamphlet for his peru&s;al. The next day I went to him to know his determi|nation. He he&s;itated, wanted to know if I could not make it a little <HI>more popular,</HI> adding that, unle&s;s I could, he feared that the publi&s;h|ing of it would endanger <HI>his windows. More popular</HI> I could not make it. I never was of an accommodating di&s;po&s;ition in my life. The only alteration I would con&s;ent to was in the title. <Q>I had given the pamphlet the double ti|tle of, <HI>&startq;The Tartuffe Detected;</HI> or, <HI>Ob&s;erva|tions,</HI> &amp;c.&endq;</Q> The former was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, though, had I not been pretty certain that eve|ry pre&s;s in the city was as little free as that to which I was &s;ending it, the <HI>Tartuffe Detected</HI> &s;hould have remained; for, the per&s;on on whom it was be&s;towed merited it much better than the character &s;o named by Moli&eacute;re.</P>
<P>The&s;e difficulties, and the&s;e fears of the book|&s;eller, at once opened my eyes with re&s;pect to the boa&s;ted liberty of the pre&s;s. Becau&s;e the laws of this country proclaim to the world, that every man may write and publi&s;h freely,
<PB N="39" REF="39">
and becau&s;e I &s;aw the news-papers filled with vaunts on the &s;ubject, I was fool enough to imagine that the pre&s;s was really free for every one. I had not the lea&s;t idea, that a man's windows were in danger of being broken, if he publi&s;hed any thing that was <HI>not popular.</HI> I did, indeed, &s;ee the words <HI>liberty</HI> and <HI>equality,</HI> the <HI>rights of man,</HI> the <HI>crimes of kings,</HI> and &s;uch like, in mo&s;t of the book&s;eller's windows; but I did not know that they were put there to &s;ave the gla&s;s, as a free republican Frenchman puts a cockade tricolor in his hat to &s;ave his head. I was ignorant of all the&s;e <HI>arcana</HI> of the liber|ty of the pre&s;s.</P>
<P><Q>If it had &s;o happened that one of the Whi&s;key-Boys had went over to England, and had re|ceived addre&s;&s;es from any part of the people there, congratulating him on his e&s;cape from a nation of ruffians, and be&s;eeching the Lord that tho&s;e ruffians might &startq;tread back the paths of <HI>infamy</HI> and <HI>ruin;&endq;</HI></Q> and if this emigrating <HI>"Martyr"</HI> in the cau&s;e of whi&s;key had echoed back the hypocritical cant, and if he and all his palavering addre&s;&s;ers had been detected and expo&s;ed by &s;ome good American, in London, would not &s;uch an American have received the applau&s;e of all men of virtue and &s;en&s;e? And what would, or rather what would not, have been &s;aid here again&s;t the pro&s;tituted pre&s;s of Great Britain, had an Engli&s;h book&s;eller te&s;ti|fied his fears to publi&s;h the truth, le&s;t his win|dows &s;hould be da&s;hed in?</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="40">
The work that it was feared would draw down puni&s;hment on the publi&s;her, did not contain one untruth, one anarchical, indecent, immoral, or irreligious expre&s;&s;ion; and yet the book&s;eller feared for his windows! For what? Becau&s;e it was not <HI>popular enough.</HI> A book&s;el|ler in a <HI>de&s;potic</HI> &s;tate fears to publi&s;h a work that is <HI>too popular</HI> and one in a <HI>free</HI> &s;tate fears to publi&s;h a work that is not <HI>popular enough.</HI> I leave it to the learned philo&s;ophers of the "Age of Rea&s;on" to determine in which of the&s;e &s;tates there is the mo&s;t liberty of the pre&s;s; for, I mu&s;t acknowledge, the point is too nice for me: fear is fear, whether in&s;pired by a Sovereign Lord the King, or by a Sovereign People.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be told, that Mr. Bradford's fears were groundle&s;s. It may be &s;o; but he ought to be a competent judge of the matter; he mu&s;t know the extent of the liberty of the pre&s;s better than I could. He might be mi&s;taken but that he was &s;incere appeared clearly from his not putting his name at the bottom of the title page. <Q>Even the <HI>Bone to Gnaw for the De+mocrats,</HI> which did not appear till about &s;i$ months afterwards, was &startq;Publi&s;hed for the Purcha&s;ers.&endq;</Q> It was not till long after th$ public had fixed the &s;eal of approbation o$ the&s;e pamphlets, that they were honoure$ with the book&s;eller's name. It was &s;omethin$ curious that the &s;econd and third and fourt$ editions &s;hould be entitled to a mark of re&s;pec$ that the fir&s;t was not worthy of. Poor littl$ innocents! They were thrown on the pari&s;$
<PB N="41" REF="41">
like foundlings; no &s;oul would own them, till it was found that they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the gift of bringing in the pence. Another &s;ingularity, is, they got into better paper as they advanced. So the prudent matron changes the little dirty ragged wench into a fine mademoi&s;elle, as &s;oon as &s;he perceives that the beaux begin to ca&s;t their eyes on her.</P>
<P>But, it is time to return, and give the read|er an account of my gains. The pecuniary concerns of an author are always the mo&s;t in|tere&s;ting.</P>
<P>The terms on which Mr. Bradford took the <HI>Ob&s;ervations,</HI> were what book&s;ellers call <HI>pub|li&s;hing it together.</HI> I beg the reader, if he fore|&s;ees the po&s;&s;ibility of his becoming author, to recollect this phra&s;e well. <HI>Publi&s;hing it toge|ther</HI> is thus managed: the book&s;eller takes the work, prints it, and defrays all expen&s;es of paper, binding, &amp;c. and the profits, if any, are divided between him and the author.&mdash;Long after the Ob&s;ervations were &s;old off, Mr. Bradford rendered me an account (undoubtedly a very ju&s;t one) of the &s;ales. According to this account, my &s;hare of the profits (my &s;hare only) amounted to the &s;um of <HI>$ne &s;hilling and &s;even-pence half-penny,</HI> curren|cy of the State of Penn&s;ylvania (or, about eleven-pence three farthings &s;terling), quite entirely clear of all deductions what&s;oever!</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="42">
Now, bulky as this &s;um appears in words $ length, I pre&s;ume, that when 1##7&frac12; is reduce to figures, no one will &s;uppo&s;e it &s;ufficient t$ put a coat upon my back. If my poor bac$ were not too broad to be clothed with &s;uch $ &s;um as this, God knows how I &s;hould bear al$ that has been, and is, and is to be, laid on i$ by the unmerciful democrats. Why! 1##7$ would not cover the back of a Lilliputian$ no, not even in rags, as they &s;ell here.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, this clothing &s;tory will at once fal$ to the ground, when I a&s;&s;ure the reader (an$ Mr. Carey will bear witne&s;s to the truth $$ what I &s;ay), that, when I offered this work fo$ publication, I had as good a coat upon m$ back, as ever Mr. Bradford or any of his bro+ther book&s;ellers put on in their lives; and, wh$$ is more, this coat was my own. No taylor no &s;hoemaker ever had my name in his books.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Ob&s;ervations,</HI> Mr. Bradford and <HI>publi&s;hed it together</HI> no longer. When a pam+phlet was ready for the pre&s;s, we made a ba$+gain for it, and I took his note of hand, pa$+able in one, two, or three months. That $Word$ public may know exactly what gains I ha$ derived from the publications that i&s;&s;ued fro$ Mr. Bradford's, There &s;ubjoin a li&s;t of the$ and the &s;ums received in payment.</P>

<P>The be&s;t way of giving the reader an idea of the genero&s;ity of my book&s;eller, is, to tell him, that upon my going into bu&s;ine&s;s for my&s;elf, I offered to purcha&s;e the copy-rights of the&s;e pamphlets at the &s;ame price that I had &s;old them at. Mr. Bradford's refu&s;ing to &s;ell, is a clear proof that they were worth more than he gave me, even after they had pa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal editions. Let it not be &s;aid, then, that he put a coat up|on my back.</P>
<P>My concerns with Mr. Bradford clo&s;ed with <HI>The Pro&s;pect from the Congre&s;s-Gallery,</HI> and, as our &s;eparation has given ri&s;e to conjectures and reports, I &s;hall trouble the reader with an ex|planation of the matter.</P>
<P>I propo&s;ed making a mere collection of the debates, with here and there a note by way of $emarks. It was not my intention to publi&s;h $t in Numbers, but at the end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, in $ne volume; but Mr. Bradford, fearing a want $f &s;ucce&s;s in this form, determined on publi&s;h|ing
<PB N="44" REF="44">
in Numbers. This was without my appro|bation, as was al&s;o a &s;ub&s;cription that was open|ed for the &s;upport of the work. When about half a Number was fini&s;hed, I was informed that many gentlemen had expre&s;&s;ed their de|&s;ire, that the work might contain a good deal of original matter, and few debates. In con|&s;equence of this, I was reque&s;ted to alter my plan; I &s;aid I would, but that I would by no means undertake to continue the work.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Number, as it was called (but not by me), was publi&s;hed, and its &s;ucce&s;s led Mr. Bradford to pre&s;s for a continuation. His &s;on offered me, I believe, a hundred dollars $ Number, in place of eighteen; and, I &s;hould have accepted his offer, had it not been for $ word that e&s;caped him during the conver&s;ation&punc; He ob&s;erved, that their cu&s;tomers would be much di&s;appointed, for that, his <HI>father ha$ promi&s;ed</HI> a continuation, and <HI>that it &s;hould b$ made very intere&s;ting.</HI> This &s;lip of the tongue$ opened my eyes at once. What! a book&s;elle$ undertake to promi&s;e that I &s;hould write, an$ that I &s;hould write to plea&s;e his cu&s;tomers too$ No; if all his <HI>cu&s;tomers,</HI> if all the Congre&s;s with the Pre&s;ident at their head, had come an$ &s;olicited me; nay, had my &s;alvation depende$ on a compliance, I would not have written ano+ther line.</P>
<P>I was fully employed at this time, having $ tran&s;lation on my hands for Mr. Mor$a$ de S$ Mery as well as another work which took u$ a great deal of my time; &s;o that, I believe, $
<PB N="45" REF="45">
&s;hould not have publi&s;hed the <HI>Cen&s;or,</HI> had it not been to convince the <HI>cu&s;tomers</HI> of Mr. Bradford, that I was not in his pay; that I was not the puppet and he the &s;how-man. That, whatever merits or demerits my writings might have, no part of them fell to his &s;hare.</P>
<P>When Mr. Bradford found I was preparing to publi&s;h a continuation of the remarks on the debates, he &s;ent me the following note:</P>

Here ended the corre&s;pondence, except that it might be &s;aid to be continued for about five minutes longer by the hearty laugh, that I be|&s;towed on this <HI>correct</HI> and polite billet.</P>
<P>It is &s;omething truly &s;ingular, that Mr. Brad|ford &s;hould threaten me with a pro&s;ecution for not writing, ju&s;t at the moment that others threatened me with a pro&s;ecution for writing. It &s;eemed a little difficult to &s;et both at open defi|ance, yet this was done, by continuing to write, and by employing another book&s;eller.</P>
<P>Indeed the&s;e book&s;ellers, in general, are a cru|el race. They imagine that the &s;oul and body of every author that falls into their hands, is their exclu&s;ive property. <Q>They have adopted the bird|catcher's maxim: &startq;a bird that can &s;ing, and wont &s;ing, ought to be made &s;ing.&endq;</Q> When|ever their devils are out of employment, the drudging goblin of an author mu&s;t &s;harpen up his pen, and never think of repo&s;e till he is relieved by the arrival of a more profitable job. Then the wretch may remain as undi&s;turbed as a &s;leep-mou&s;e in winter, while the &s;tupid dolt whom he has clad and fattened, receives the applau&s;e.</P>
<P>I now come to the a&s;&s;ertion, that I am, or have been, in the pay of the Briti&s;h govern|ment.</P>
<P><Q>In the fir&s;t place the democrats &s;wear that I have been &startq;frequently vi&s;ited by a certain Agent,&endq; meaning I &s;uppo&s;e Mr. Bond:</Q> to
<PB N="48" REF="48">
this I an&s;wer, that it is an abominable lie. I never &s;aw Mr. Bond but three times in my life, and then I had bu&s;ine&s;s with him as the inter|preter of Frenchmen, who wanted certificates from him, in order to &s;ecure their property in the conquered colonies. I never in my life &s;poke to, corre&s;ponded with, or even &s;aw, to my knowledge, either of the Briti&s;h Mini&s;ters, or any one of their retinue. Mr. Bradford once told me, that Mr. Allen, the father-in-law of Mr. Hammond, &s;aid he was acquainted with me. If this gentleman did really &s;ay &s;o, he joked, or he told a lie; for he never &s;aw me in his life, that I know of.</P>
<P>A little while after the New Year's Gift was publi&s;hed, an attack was made in the <HI>Argus</HI> o$ New York, on the &s;uppo&s;ed author of it; i$+con&s;equence of which, this &s;uppo&s;ed author or &s;ome one in his behalf, took occa&s;ion to ob+&s;erve, in Mr. Claypoole's paper, that it wa$ uncandid to attribute to a gentleman of irre+proachable character, what was well known t$ be the work of a democrat. I had a grea$ mind to &s;ay at that time, what I &s;hall now &s;ay and that is, that let this gentleman be who h$ will, I think my&s;elf as good as he, and of as goo$ a character too; and that, as to the di&s;hono$$ attached to the publication, I am willing $$ take it all to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>It is hard to prove a negative; it is what $ man is expected to do; yet, I think I c$$ prove, that the accu&s;ation of my being in B$$+ti&s;h
<PB N="49" REF="49">
pay is not &s;upported by one &s;ingle fact, or the lea&s;t &s;hadow of probability.</P>
<P>When a foreign government hires a writer, it takes care that his labours &s;hall be di&s;tributed, whether the readers are all willing to pay for them or not. This we daily &s;ee verified in the di&s;|tribution of certain bla&s;phemous gazettes, which, though kicked from the door with di&s;dain, flies in at the window. Now, has this ever been the ca&s;e with the works of Peter Porcupine? Were they ever thru&s;ted upon people in &s;pite of their remon&s;trances? Can Mr. Bradford &s;ay that thou&s;ands of the&s;e pamphlets have ever been paid for by any agent of Great Britain? Can he &s;ay that I have ever di&s;tributed any of them? No; he can &s;ay no &s;uch thing. They had, at fir&s;t, to encounter every difficulty, and they have made their way &s;upported by public approbation, and by that alone. Mr. Brad|ford, if he is candid enough to repeat what he told me, will &s;ay, that the Briti&s;h Con&s;ul, when he purcha&s;ed half a dozen of them, in&s;i&s;ted upon having them <HI>at the whole&s;ale price!</HI> Did this look like a de&s;ire to encourage them? Be&s;ides, tho&s;e who know any thing of Mr. Bradford, will never believe, that he would have lent his aid to a Briti&s;h Agent's publicati|ons; for, of all the Americans I have yet con|ver&s;ed with, he &s;eems to entertain the greate&s;t degree of rancour again&s;t that nation.</P>

lea&s;t, of my publications. <Q>I happened to be in a book&s;eller's &s;hop, un&s;een by him, when he had the goodne&s;s to &s;ay, that I was a <HI>&startq;wild fellow.&endq;</HI></Q> On which I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that when the King be&s;tows on me about five hun|dred pounds &s;terling a year, perhaps, I may become a <HI>tame fellow,</HI> and hear my ma&s;ter, my countrymen, my friends and my parents, be|lied and execrated, without &s;aying one &s;ingle word in their defence.</P>
<P>Had the Mini&s;ter of Great Britain employed me to write, can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that he would not furni&s;h me with the means of living well, without becoming the retailer of my own works? Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that he would have &s;uffered me ever to appear on the &s;$ene&punc; It mu&s;t be a very poor king that he &s;erves, if he could not afford me more than I can get by keeping a book-&s;hop. An Amba&s;|&s;ador from a king of the Gyp&s;ies could no$ have acted a m$$$er part. What! where wa$ all the "gold of Pitt?" That gold which tempt+ed, according to the democrats, an America$ Envoy to &s;ell his country, and two-thirds o$ the Senate to ratifiy the bargain: that gol$ which, according to the Convention of Franc$ has made one half of that nation cut the throa$ of the other half; that potent gold could n$ keep Peter Porcupine from &s;tanding behind$ counter to &s;ell a pen-kni&s;e, or a quire of pape$&punc;</P>
<P>Mu&s;t it not be evident, too, that the kee$+ing of a &s;hop would take up a great part of $$ time? Time that was hardly worth a payi$$

for at all, if it was not of higher value than the profits on a few pamphlets. Every one knows that the Cen&s;or has been delayed on ac|count of my entering on bu&s;ine&s;s; would the Mini&s;ter of Great Britain have &s;uffered this, had I been in his pay? No; I repeat, that it is downright &s;tupidity to &s;uppo&s;e, that he would ever have &s;uffered me to appear at all, had he even felt in the lea&s;t intere&s;ted in the fate of my works, or the effect they might produce. He mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that, &s;eeing the uncon|querable prejudices exi&s;ting in this country, my being known to be an Engli&s;hman would operate weightily again&s;t whatever I might ad|vance. I &s;aw this very plainly my&s;elf; but, as I had a living to get, and as I had deter|mined on this line of bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;uch a con&s;ider|ation was not to awe me into idlene&s;s, or make me &s;orego any other advantages that I had rea&s;on to hope I &s;hould enjoy.</P>
<P>The notion of my being in Briti&s;h pay aro&s;e from my having now-and-then taken upon me to attempt a defence of the character of that nation, and of the intentions of its government towards the United States. But, have I ever teazed my readers with this, except when the &s;ubject nece&s;&s;arily demanded it? And if I have given way to my indignation when a hy|poeritical political divine attempted to degrade my country, or when its vile calumniators call|ed it "an in&s;ular Ba&s;tile," what have I done more than every good man in my place would have done? What have I done more than my $Word$&punc; th$$ obeyed the feelings of my heart?
<PB N="52" REF="52">
When a man hears his country reviled, does it require that he &s;hould be paid for &s;peaking in its defence?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, had my works been intended to in|troduce Briti&s;h influence, they would have a&s;|&s;umed a more conciliating tone. The author would have flattered the people of this coun|try, even in their exce&s;&s;es; he would have en|deavoured to gain over the enemies of Britain by &s;mooth and &s;oothing language; he would have "&s;tooped to conquer;" he would not, as I have done, rendered them hatred for hatred, and &s;corn for &s;corn.</P>
<P>My writings, the fir&s;t pamphlet excepted, have had no other object than that of keeping alive an attachment to the Con&s;titution of the United States and the ine&s;timable man who is at the head of the government, and to paint in their true colours tho&s;e who are the enemies of both; to warn the people, of all ranks and de&s;criptions, of the danger of admitting among them, the anarchical and bla&s;phemous princi|ples of the French revolutioni&s;ts, principles as oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e of liberty as hell is to hea|ven. If, therefore, I have written at the in|&s;tance of a Briti&s;h agent, that agent mu&s;t mo&s;$ certainly de&s;erve the thanks of all the rea$ friends of America. But, &s;ay &s;ome of the hal$ democrats, what right have you to meddl$ with the defence of our government at all?&mdash;The &s;ame right that you have to exact my obe+dience to it, and my contribution towards it &s;upport.

the country as I had been, &s;erved in the mili|tia again&s;t the we&s;tern rebels, and, had I been called on, I mu&s;t have &s;erved too. Surely a man has a right to defend with his pen, that which he may be compelled to defend with a mu&s;quet.</P>
<P>As to the real, bloody, cut-throats, they carry their notion of excluding me from the u&s;e of the pre&s;s &s;till further. <Q>"While" (&s;ays one of them) &startq;While I am a friend to the <HI>unlimited</HI> freedom of the pre&s;s, when exerci&s;ed by <HI>an American,</HI> I am an implaca|ble foe to its pro&s;titution to a <HI>foreigner,</HI> and would at any time a&s;&s;i&s;t in hunting out of &s;oci|ety, any meddling foreigner who &s;hould dare to interfere in our politics.

<P><HI>"An American."</HI></P>
<P>Are not you, Mr. Swanwick, the Pre&s;ident of the Emigration Society? Well, then, Sir, as your in&s;titution is &s;aid to be for the informa|tion of per&s;ons emigrating from foreign coun|tries, be &s;o good as to in&s;ert the little extract, above quoted, in your next di&s;patches for a cargo of emigrants. Above all, Sir, be &s;ure to tell tho&s;e who are di&s;po&s;ed to emigrate from England, tho&s;e martyrs in the cau&s;e of liberty; be &s;ure to tell them that this is the land of <HI>equal</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="54">
liberty; <Q>that here, and here alone, they will find the true unlimited freedom of the pre&s;s, but that, if they dare to make u&s;e of it, <HI>&startq;ju&s;tice, honour,</HI> national <HI>gratitude,</HI> will call for ex|emplary <HI>vengeance</HI> on their heads.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>I &s;hould not have noticed this di&s;tinction be|tween <HI>foreigners</HI> and <HI>Americans,</HI> had I not per|ceived, that &s;everal per&s;ons, who are, general|ly &s;peaking, friends to their country, &s;eem to think that it was impertinent in me to meddle with the politics here, becau&s;e I was an Eng|li&s;hman. I would have the&s;e good people to recollect, that the laws of this country hold out, to foreigners, an offer of all that liberty of the pre&s;s which Americans enjoy, and that, if this liberty be abridged, by whatever means it may be done, the laws and the con&s;titution and all together is a mere cheat; a &s;nare to catch the credulous and enthu&s;ia&s;tic of every other nation; a downright impo&s;ition on the world. If people who emigrate hither have not a right to make u&s;e of the liberty of the pre&s;s, while the natives have, it is very ill done to call this a country of <HI>equal</HI> liberty. <HI>Equal</HI> above all epithets, is the mo&s;t improper that can be applied to it; for, if none but Ameri+cans have acce&s;s to the pre&s;s, they are the ma&s;+ters and &s;oreigners are their &s;ubjects, nay thei$ &s;laves. An honourable and comfortable &s;itua+tion upon my word! <Q>The emigrants from &s;om$ countries may be content with it, perhaps: would not &s;ay, that the &startq;Martyrs in the cau&s;$ o&s; liberty&endq; from England, would not quietl$ bend beneath the yoke, as, indeed, they ar$

in duty bound to do;</Q> but, for my part, who have not the ambition to a&s;pire to the crown of martyrdom, I mu&s;t and I will be excu&s;ed. Ei|ther the laws &s;hall be altered, or I will con|tinue to avail my&s;elf of the liberty that they held out to me, and that partly tempt|ed me to the country. When an act is pa&s;&s;|ed for excluding Engli&s;hmen from exerci&s;|ing their talents, and from promulgating what they write, then will I defi&s;t; but, I hope, when that time arrives, no act will be pa&s;&s;ed to prevent people from emigrating back again.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay a word or two about the mi&s;erable &s;hift, which the democrats have had recour&s;e to, re&s;pecting the infamous letter of <HI>Citizen Hint.</HI> They now pretend, that I fabricated it my&s;elf, though I have publicly declared, that it was deliver|ed into my hands by a gentleman of reputati|on, who&s;e name I have mentioned. Can any one be &s;tupid enough to imagine, that I would, particularly at this time, have run the ri&s;k of being detected in &s;uch a &s;hameful bu&s;ine&s;s? And, how could it have been undertaken without run|ning that ri&s;k? Had I written it my&s;elf, there would have been my hand-writing again&s;t me, and had I employed another, that other might have betrayed me; he might have ruined me in the opinion of all tho&s;e, whom it is my in|tere&s;t as well as my pride to be e&s;teemed by; or, at be&s;t, I &s;hould have been at his mercy for ever afterwards.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="56">
Be&s;ides the great ri&s;k of detection, let any one point out, if he can, what end I could propo&s;e to my&s;elf by &s;uch a device. As to making my &s;hop and my&s;elf known, I pre&s;ume I did not &s;tand in need of a &s;care-crow, to ef|fect that, when the kind democrats them&s;elves had publi&s;hed to the whole Union, that I had taken the hou&s;e in which I live, for the purpo&s;e of retailing my "poi&s;on," as they called it, and had even had the candour to tell the world, that I had paid my rent in advance. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It was to Mr. Franklin Bache's creditable and in+corruptible Gazette, that I was indebted for this volun+teer adverti&s;ement. This was generous in a declare$ foe; but tho&s;e will not be a&s;toni&s;hed at the editor's can+dour and <HI>tolerating principles,</HI> who are acquainted wit$ the following anecdote.</P>
<P><HI>From the European Magazine, for Sept.</HI> 1795, <HI>page</HI> 156.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;When Voltaire arrived at Paris, an interview too place between him and Franklin. After the fir&s;t co$+pliments, which by the way were more adulative th$ comported with the character of an American, a$ above all of a &s;tern Republican, the Doctor pre&s;ent his grand&s;on to Voltaire, in &s;oliciting for him <HI>ble&s;&s;ing.</HI> The philo&s;opher of impiety reli&s;hed the pl$+&s;antry; and to render the farce complete, he $Word$ from his chair, and with a patriarchal air, laid hands on the head of <HI>the child,</HI> and &s;olemnly p$+nounced, in a loud voice, the&s;e three words: <HI>$Word$ Liberty,</HI> and <HI>Toleration.</HI> All the pious were &s;hoe$ at the American, who, they &s;aid, burle&s;qued Relig$ in a&s;king the <HI>ble&s;&s;ing</HI> of Voltaire.&endq;</Q></P></NOTE> They affect to believe, &s;ometimes, that the letter was a mere trick to bring in the pence, and, in one of their late&s;t paragraphs, they call me a

"catch-penny author." But, let them recol|lect, that I am now a book&s;eller, who&s;e trade it is to get money; and if I am driven to &s;uch &s;hifts as the Scare-Crow, to get a living, let them reconcile this circum&s;tance with their a&s;&s;ertions concerning my being liberally paid by Great Britain. A man in Briti&s;h pay, rolling in "the Gold of Pitt," could certainly never be &s;o reduced as to venture every thing for the &s;ake of collecting a few eleven-penny bits. It is the misfortune of the democrats ever to fur|ni&s;h arguments again&s;t them&s;elves.</P>
<P><Q>Tho&s;e who rea&s;on upon the improbability of the democrat's &s;ending the threatening letter, do not recollect the extract I have above quoted from the <HI>Aurora,</HI> in which the people of Phi|ladelphia are called upon to murder me, and are told, that <HI>&startq;ju&s;tice, honour,</HI> and national <HI>gratitude</HI> demand it.&endq;</Q> Is it very improba|ble that men, capable of writing paragraphs like this, &s;hould, upon finding the people deaf to their <HI>honourable</HI> in&s;inuations, attempt to in|timidate my landlord by a cut-throat letter?</P>
<P>Their great object is to &s;ilence me, to this all their endeavours point: lies, threats, &s;pies and informers, every engine of Jacobinical invention is played off. I am &s;orry to tell them, that it is all in vain, for I am one of tho&s;e who&s;e ob&s;tinacy increa&s;es with oppo&s;i|tion.</P>
