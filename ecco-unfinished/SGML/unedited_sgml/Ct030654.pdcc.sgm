<L>Both have been wrong'd: Prevent their guilty Joy,</L>
<L>Who wou'd your mutual Amity de&s;troy.</L>
<L>Wou'd you pre&s;erve your Freedom? guard his Throne,</L>
<L>Who makes your Peace and Happine&s;s his own.</L>
<L>Wou'd you be grateful? let your Monarch know</L>
<L>Which Way you wou'd be be&s;t, and make him &s;o.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But &s;oft! methinks, I hear &s;ome Fops complain;</L>
<L>Who came prepared to give the Ladies Pain,</L>
<L>That they have dre&s;s'd and &s;pent&mdash;Gad's Cur&s;e&mdash;three Hours in vain.</L>
<L>No Hints ob&s;cene, improved by their broad Stare,</L>
<L>Have given Confu&s;ion to the tortured Fair.</L>
<L>We own the Charge. Let Mon&s;ieur <HI>Harlequin</HI></L>
<L>And his trim Troop your loo&s;e Applau&s;es win:</L>
<L>Too much already has each mode&s;t Ear</L>
<L>Been there in&s;ulted; we'll protect them here.</L>

<L>SACRED to Virtue, Liberty, and Truth,</L>
<L>The Mu&s;es bloom in Everla&s;ting Youth.</L>
<L>Pre&s;s'd, like the Palm, they ri&s;e beneath their Weight,</L>
<L>And &s;oar above the Reach of Time, or Fate.</L>
<L>When Bra&s;s, or Marble, faithle&s;s to their Tru&s;t,</L>
<L>No longer bear the Name, nor guard the Du&s;t</L>
<L>Of Kings, or Heroes, to their Charge con&s;ign'd,</L>
<L>But yield to Age, and leave no Track behind;</L>
<L>The Poet's Pen, with never dying Lays;</L>
<L>Pre&s;erves their Fame and celebrates their Prai&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let Artful <HI>Maro,</HI> or bold <HI>Lucan</HI> tell,</L>
<L>How regal <HI>Troy,</HI> or <HI>Rome,</HI> more awfull, fell;</L>
<L>Nations de&s;troy'd revive, lo&s;t Empires &s;hine,</L>
<L>And Freedom glows in each immortal Line.</L>
<L>In vain would Faction, War, or lawle&s;s Power,</L>
<L>Which marr the Patriot's Scheme, his Fame devour;</L>
<L>When Bards, by their Superior Force, can &s;ave,</L>
<L>From dark Oblivion and defeat the Grave.</L>
<L>Say, <HI>Britons,</HI> mu&s;t this Art for&s;ake your I&s;le,</L>
<L>And leave to vagrant Apes, her native Soil?</L>
<L>Mu&s;t She, the deare&s;t Friend that Freedom knows,</L>
<L>Driv'n from her Seat, &s;eek Refuge with her Foes?</L>
<L>Forbid &s;o great a Shame, and &s;ave the Age</L>
<L>From &s;uch Reproach, You Patrons of the Stage.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Since well we know, there's not a Theme &s;o dear,</L>
<L>As virtuous Freedom, to a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Ear;</L>
<L>T' indulge &s;o ju&s;t a Ta&s;te, to Night we &s;ing</L>
<L>A Pious Hero, and a Patriot King;</L>
<L>By Nature form'd, by Providence de&s;ign'd</L>
<L>To Scourge Ambition, and to right Mankind:</L>
<L>Such <HI>Ca&s;triot</HI> was. O might it but appear,</L>
<L>That he retains the lea&s;t Re&s;emblance here!</L>
<L>Should but the &s;malle&s;t Portion of that Fire,</L>
<L>Which fill'd his ample Brea&s;t our Scenes in&s;pire:</L>
<L>The abject Slave, to his Reproach, &s;hall &s;ee,</L>
<L>That &s;uch as dare de&s;erve it, may be free:</L>
<L>And con&s;cious Tyranny confe&s;s, with Shame,</L>
<L>That blind Ambition wanders from her Aim&punc;</L>
<L>While Virtue leads her Votaries to Fame.</L>
