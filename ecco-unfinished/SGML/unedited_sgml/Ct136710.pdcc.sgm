<HEAD>ADDENDA, To Page 25.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Enquiry was printed off before we met the following Particulars, which be|ing, as we judge, very remarkable, the Reader is de&s;ired to add 'em to Page the 25th, after the Certificate of the <HI>Formo&s;an</HI> Cha|racters.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;The I&s;le <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> called by the <HI>Chine&s;e Pac|cande</HI>, a hundred and thirty Leagues in Cir|cuit, is full of populous villages, <HI>governed by &endq;&s;everal Lords at War one with another</HI>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The I&s;le is divided into Eleven Provinces, or Shires. <HI>The Fir&s;t</HI> contains the Towns of <HI>Sinkan</HI>, and Eleven more, formerly under the <HI>Hollanders. The Second</HI> is <HI>Kabelany</HI>, and con|tains Seventy Two Towns and Villages, which the <HI>Hollanders could not &s;ubdue, but made Peace with them, The Third</HI> belongs to the King of <HI>Middag</HI>, and is <HI>North Ea&s;t of Taya|van</HI>, &s;outhward of the River <HI>Patientia</HI>, has Seventeen Towns. <HI>The Fourth, Pimaba</HI>,
<PB REF="6">
Eight Towns, and &s;everal Villages. <HI>The Fifth, Sapat</HI>, on the other &s;ide <HI>Formo&s;a</HI>, [Ea&s;t of <HI>Tayavan</HI>] has Ten Towns. <HI>The Sixth, Taka|bolder</HI>, has eight Towns, and &s;everal Villages, <HI>Here is a Mountain that may be &s;een from</HI> Tayavan. <HI>The Seventh, Cardeman</HI>, has Five Villages, and was governed by a Woman, <HI>who &s;ent the</HI> Hollanders <HI>Provi&s;ions when they march|ed into the Field. The Eighth</HI> has Twelve Vil|lages. <HI>The Ninth, Tokodekal</HI>, has Seven Towns, and Seven Villages. <HI>The Tenth, Puk|kall</HI>, is one City. <HI>The Eleventh, Percuzzi</HI> and <HI>Perguni</HI>, Two Towns. Be&s;ides all the&s;e, <HI>there &endq;are abundance of Lord&s;hips in the Mountains</HI>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;For the Privilege of Fi&s;hing under this I&s;le, <HI>the Chine&s;e u&s;ed to pay the Tyth of all Fi&s;h for &endq;Cu&s;tom to the</HI> Hollanders.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Again&s;t the North-Ea&s;t Part of <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> lies a great and rich Gold Mine,&mdash;at the Foot [of the Mountain] runs a River with many winding Reaches; &s;o that they who go in que&s;t of the Gold mu&s;t cro&s;s the Stream above twen|ty times, and with great Danger from the &endq;Stones that fall from the Rocks.</Q></P>
<P>"<HI>The&s;e Mountains have not hitherto been con+quer'd "by any.</HI></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The <HI>Hollanders</HI> have often endeavour'd to go &s;ome Ground on the&s;e Highlands, but were re+&endq;pul&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;<HI>The Men</HI> of <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> are very large, in the plain Country.&mdash;They <HI>of the Mountains are $+&endq;le&s;&s;er Stature</HI>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;When any dye, the Friends of the Deceas'd flock together, and bring with 'em Store o$ &endq;<HI>Man's Fle&s;h</HI>, and &s;everal intoxicating Liquors.</Q></P>
<P><PB REF="7">"In the Winter they wear <HI>Bears and other "wild Bea&s;ts Skins</HI>.</P>

<P><Q>&startq;Their Hou&s;es built of Wood, and &s;plit Cane. &mdash;The foremo&s;t Part of the Foundation <HI>re|&s;embles a Semicircle, or half Moon</HI>; and like|wi&s;e the Roof over the Front. <HI>Every Hou&s;e is almo&s;t Sixty Foot broad, and Two Hundred Foot &endq;long, with only one Room, and one Story.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;<HI>All the</HI> Formo&s;ans much differ from one ano|ther in Speech, &s;o that you &s;hall &s;eldom find two or three Villages, tho' but three or four Leagues a&s;under, where their dialect does not vary &s;o very much that they are forced to u&s;e Inter|&endq;preters.</Q></P>

<P><Q>&startq;A Bow &s;hot di&s;tant lies a &s;trong out-work, being the Key to the Ca&s;tle called <HI>Utrech</HI>;&mdash; Ea&s;tward of which &s;tands <HI>a Town built al&s;o by the</HI> Netherlanders, <HI>called by the Name of the &endq;I&s;le</HI> [Tayavan] <HI>about a Mile in Circumference</HI>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Mo&s;t of the Inhabitants of <HI>Tayavan</HI> are at pre&s;ent outlaw'd <HI>Chine&s;e</HI>, who will not acknow|ledge the <HI>Tartar</HI>, the&s;e taking it from the <HI>Hol|landers, Anno</HI> 1661, brought all under the &endq;Subjection of their General <HI>Coxinga</HI>.</Q></P>

<P>It is plain from hence, that the I&s;land <HI>Formo|&s;a</HI> is very populous; has many Kingdoms; was not under <HI>China</HI> when the <HI>Dutch</HI> were there, for they had Toll from the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI>; that the <HI>Dutch</HI> never &s;ubdued more than a &s;mall part of the Coa&s;t, and could make Peace with but a few of the other Princes, but could never get to the Gold Mines.

For the South being about one fourth of the whole is capable of containing all the&s;e Provinces and Towns, which could not lie far a&s;under. For a Mountain in the Sixth is &s;een at <HI>Tayavan</HI>, and the Queen of the Seventh &s;ent Provi&s;ion to the <HI>Dutch</HI> in their Marches, and they reach from Sea to Sea, and yet the <HI>Dutch</HI> got no ground up|on the <HI>Highlands</HI>.</P>

<HEAD>An Impartial ENQUIRY INTO THE OBJECTIONS Again&s;t <HI>George P&s;almanaazaar</HI>.</HEAD>
<P>HAD this Inquiry been intended to vin|dicate <HI>Geo. P&mdash;r</HI> farther than he &s;hall appear to merit it, a different Method &s;hould have been per&s;ued, and &s;ome very eloquent Per&s;on procured to have undertaken his Defence. And, no doubt, we might have had as good Succe&s;s as others in the u&s;e of the &s;ame means to contrary purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>But our Intent being only to find out the Truth concerning him, we did not think it nece&s;|&s;ary to engage any Advocates. Tho' we have no Schollars among us, yet we thought an ho|ne&s;t indu&s;trious natural Rea&s;on &s;ufficient both to manage our Inquiry, and direct our Judgment up|on it. E&s;pecially, &s;ince we do not direct others,
<PB N="2" REF="11">
but leave every Reader to judge for him&s;elf. And &s;ince we look for no other return than to be told whether we are mi&s;taken, and in what Par|ticular.</P>
<P>Were it only that the Re&s;pect &s;hewn by us to <HI>P&mdash;r</HI> might not be mi&s;placed, we &s;hould never trouble the World with asking any thing about him. The debate is of far greater Con&s;equence, as we think. The Reputation of our Church, and the propagating our Religion &s;eem very much concerned in it. If <HI>P&mdash;r</HI> be &s;incere, he is as no|ble an In&s;tance of the Excellency of our Church above any particular Church of Chri&s;tendom as can be wi&s;ht; and he may carry this excellent Re|ligion to <HI>Japan</HI> and all its dependencies.</P>
<P>Their more immediate Concerns both Eccle&s;i|a&s;tick and Civil have, as we &s;uppo&s;e, rendred it impracticable for the mo&s;t proper Judges to make this Inquiry, which &s;ome have perplext as much as they could. The many Objects of Charity, concerning who&s;e Merit there can be no debate, have made it &s;eem unnece&s;&s;ary to many others, who think his fitne&s;s to receive their Benefactions the only Rea&s;on they have to inquire about him. And it &s;eems the more Curious have been di&s;cou|raged from it by not attending to the different Cir|cum&s;tances of things called by the &s;ame Names, and to &s;ome things in the common Accounts of <HI>Formo&s;a</HI>, which go a great way to clear up the matter. And therefore we thought our &s;elves the only Per&s;ons that would undertake this Affair; and hope our Sincerity may atone for want of E+loquence and all other Endowments nece&s;&s;ary for the better &s;etting forth this Inquiry.</P>
<P>Had we known as much of the World as the Gentlemen la&s;t named before we had been at al$ acquainted with <HI>P&mdash;r</HI>, we &s;hould very probably
<PB N="3" REF="12">
have let him pa&s;&s;ed as they do: But he was brought among us by a pious Member of the Church, who without any de&s;ign, &s;ave the Service of Piety, had made him&s;elf acquainted with him; and none of us had heard any Objections again&s;t him before we &s;aw his Chri&s;tian Behaviour, which made us thus zealous to inquire into the Validity of the&s;e Objections. And here we omitted no|thing that was thought any way conducing to our fuller Information. We got all the printed Ac|counts we could hear of, and inquired of as ma|ny Travellers as we met with; we talkt with Friends and Enemies, we put out publick No|tices of our Inquiry, and intreated, and as far as good Manners permitted, even challenged the World to &s;end us what they have to &s;ay again&s;t him; and &s;hall faithfully &s;et down all we met with upon every hand, and hope if any thing yet remains, it will fall under the Rules by which we have been able to make our Judgments of tho&s;e we met with. And therefore the World from henceforth may fully determine about <HI>P&mdash;r</HI>, and the Church make u&s;e of him if not for propaga|ting the Faith, yet as an in&s;tance of the Good|ne&s;s and Excellency of her Doctrine and Con&s;ti|tution.</P>
<P>For the better making this Determination, the Objections &s;hall be di&s;po&s;ed into three general Heads.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t</HI>, Such as are rai&s;ed from the Difference betwixt his and our Accounts of <HI>Formo&s;a</HI>, which as &s;ome &s;ay are &s;o very incon&s;i&s;tent as to render his whole Account &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly</HI>, Such as ari&s;e from the Particulars in his Account, which &s;ay others mu&s;t be allowed fal&s;e tho' we &s;hould admit his Account to be true in the main.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="13"><HI>La&s;tly</HI>, Such as are taken from the Colour of his Skin, his Hair, his Mien, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which &s;ay others are &s;ufficient to di&s;prove his being of <HI>Formo&s;a</HI>, tho' his Account and all the Parts be true.</P>
<P>Under the fir&s;t Head will come to be con&s;ider'd (1) All our printed Accounts of <HI>Formo&s;a</HI>, and (2) two MSS. Letters from a Merchant of <HI>Suf|folk</HI>, and (3) the Account given <HI>viva voce</HI> by the Rev.&mdash; of <HI>Oxford</HI>, who has lately been in <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> upon curious Inquiries, and this among the re&s;t.</P>
<P>To the &s;econd Head will be reducible an Ac|count of two Letters from <HI>Avignon</HI> (2) all the Ob|jections we received in Writing. (3) The printed Eclairci&s;&s;ements of Mr. <HI>D. Amalvy</HI> the <HI>Calvini&s;t</HI> Teacher of <HI>Sluice</HI>. And (4) mo&s;t of the Obje|ctions we at any time have met in our verbal In|quiries about him.</P>
<P N="1">&sect;. I. <HI>Fir&s;t</HI>, It &s;eems mo&s;t proper to begin with that Objection which is the mo&s;t formidable, and &s;trikes at his whole Story, becau&s;e of the manife&s;t Difference between it and all our Accounts of the &s;ame place. For if this be &s;o, if they do indeed differ &s;o very much it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be true on both &s;ides, and then we mu&s;t give the Preference to our own Accounts, as being ma|ny, and well atte&s;ted, and always received.</P>
<P>Now tho' the Learned do not need it, yet we hope they will pardon us, if for the &s;ake of others we &s;et down a &s;hort Hi&s;tory of <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> from our own Accounts both Printed and Written, and of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Settlement upon it.</P>
<P N="1">1. We find that before the <HI>Dutch</HI> came thither there was an Emporium very near it upon a &s;mall I&s;land called <HI>Tyavan</HI>, who&s;e Bigne&s;s, Site and
<PB N="5" REF="14">
Conveniency for Trade may appear to the Reader from the Map annext.</P>
<P>This Map we have from a Copy brought from the <HI>Ea&s;t Indias</HI>, by the ingenious Author of the <HI>Malayan</HI> Grammar and Dictionary <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Captain <HI>Bowry</HI>'s Map of <HI>Formo&s;a</HI>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Occa&s;ion of this <HI>Emporium</HI>, was a Prohi|bition of the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Emperor, forbidding the <HI>Jappone&s;e</HI> to come to <HI>China</HI>, and the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> to go to <HI>Japan</HI>, upon which both by con&s;ent to ward off the Severity of the Edict found out a Third place, namely <HI>Tayavan</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Erat tunc temporis in China multi Japponii &mdash;hi totam ali|quam urbem dev$&s;tarunt &mdash; Cae&s;ar Chinae &mdash; Itaque &mdash; omnes Jap|ponen&s;es regno &s;uo ejecit &amp; in perpetuum ab&s;tinere illo Ju&s;&s;it &mdash; Edictum quoque promulgavit &s;ub poen&acirc; mortis ne quis Chinen&s;ium in Japponiam navigaret &mdash; Exclu&s;i ex China Japponen&s;es in&s;tituerunt navigationes ad <HI>Tayavan</HI> ubi a Chinen&s;ibus merces accipiebant &s;u|i&s;que permutabunt &mdash; &s;ed Cae&s;ar Chinae Re comperta prohibuit &s;ub|ditis &s;uis illuc loci ire. <HI>Vareni de&s;cript Japon.

<P N="2">2.

And the&s;e had eight Cantons or Towns upon the Coa&s;ts, cal|led <HI>Sincan, Mandauw, Soulang Backeloang, Taffucan, Tiffulucan, Teopang</HI>, and <HI>Teffurang</HI>; all within one Days Journey of the Fort, &s;ave the la&s;t, which was one Day and half's Journey <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Candidius <HI>and</HI> Grevius.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="7">7. The I&s;le of <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> is &s;ituated from 21 De|grees 20 Minutes, to 25 Degrees 10 Minutes, North Lat. which is 3 Degrees 50 Minutes, and amounts to 230 Miles in length, if it lay direct North and South, whereas the declining makes it

more. So that the&s;e <HI>Coa&s;ters</HI> of <HI>Sincan, &amp;c.</HI> had but a &s;mall part of the whole, and &s;eem to be the old Inhabitants drawn to the Sea-&s;ide by &s;ome Invaders, as the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> in <HI>Britain</HI> by our <HI>Saxon</HI> Ance&s;tors. And therefore to bring the Matter to &s;ome Certainty, and that our Inquiry may be put to an end, we think we may lay down this Rule by which to guide our &s;elves, namely,</P>
<P><HI>That &s;ince the&s;e</HI> Sideis Formo&s;aan&s;che, <HI>the&s;e Coa&s;ters of</HI> Formo&s;a <HI>are by</HI> Candidius <HI>di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the other People of</HI> Formo&s;a, <HI>and have no Corre&s;pondence with them; and &s;ince we do not yet know tho&s;e other People who are the principal and greate&s;t part of the Inhabitants of the I&s;le</HI>. Therefore, <HI>&s;uch Accounts as relate only to tho&s;e Coa&s;ters do not contradict</HI> P&s;&mdash;r, <HI>who de&s;cribes the other parts of the I&s;le, and the principal Inha|bitants thereof</HI>.</P>
<P>So that here's a Rule, by which any En|quiry for the future, may be directed. <HI>Do you &s;peak of the People whom the</HI> Dutch <HI>had to do with when they were &s;ettled upon</HI> Tayavan, <HI>or of the whole I&s;land?</HI> If <HI>the former</HI>, then <HI>P&s;&mdash;r</HI> may be right; for no Accounts of them do at all interfere with his. And we have now no occa|&s;ion to go after this or the other Gentleman that has been in <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI>, or heard, or read of it. Every one for him&s;elf may direct his own Judg|ment, and for the future prevent any Error in this Affair.</P>
<P>However, we &s;hall ask leave to tell the Rea|der what we farther find in the Accounts of <HI>Taya|van</HI> and <HI>Formo&s;a</HI>.</P>
<P N="8">8. It is very remarkable, the &s;trange Jealou&s;ie the&s;e <HI>I&s;landers</HI> have one of another. As an In|&s;tance of which take the following Story.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="17">There is a &s;mall I&s;land, called by the Dutch <HI>the golden Lyon I&s;land</HI>, but by the <HI>A&s;ians Tugin</HI>; it lyes upon that &s;ide of <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> next <HI>China</HI>, South from <HI>Tayavan</HI> <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Tabula A&s;iae Orientalis emendata per F.

<Q>&startq;The People maintain'd conti|nual War with the Dutch, and were &s;o jealous of Strangers as not to &s;uffer them to &s;et Foot on Shore. They have &s;ome Traffick with the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI>, who don't come a&s;hore, but remain in &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, the I&s;landers come out to 'em in Boats, and take with the right hand what they are to have, while they give with the left their Portion to the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI>, and are &s;ure not to let go their hold before they are &s;atisfy'd &endq;in the other <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Candidius.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P N="9">9. It is farther remarkable, that tho&s;e People were not under <HI>China</HI> at this time, <HI>viz.</HI> 1630. And hence one would be tempted to think the <HI>Formo&s;ans</HI> were not then Tributaries to <HI>China</HI>. If &s;uch a &s;mall I&s;land could maintain its own Sove|reignty, much more <HI>Formo&s;a</HI>; and if <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> had then been under <HI>China</HI>, could <HI>Tugin</HI>, a &s;mall I&s;land between <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Formo&s;a</HI>, and &s;o near to the latter, remain unconquer'd?</P>
<P N="10">10. It is yet farther remarkable, that the <HI>Dutch, Anno</HI> 1630. had not this &s;mall I&s;le <HI>Tugin</HI> under their Juri&s;diction, and that the Coa&s;ters, <HI>Formo|&s;ans</HI>, had it not under theirs; for thus the Story goes on,</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Not long ago, about 60 Men belonging to <HI>Soulang</HI> &s;ailed thither di&s;gui&s;ed like <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Merchants&mdash;whereupon &s;ome of the I&s;landers coming out, they (the <HI>Soulang</HI> Men) took hold of the Arm of one of 'em, as he was &s;tretching

it out to lay hold of what was offered him, and forced him into their Ve&s;&s;el, cut him in pie|ces, brought him home as a Token of a mo&s;t &s;ignal Victory<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Candid. ubi. &s;upra.</NOTE>; and he had &s;aid before that the&s;e <HI>Tuginers</HI> were in a continual War with &endq;the <HI>Dutch</HI>.</Q></P>
<P N="11">11. And we think we may conclude from them, that &s;ince the Coa&s;ters of <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> and the Natives of <HI>Tugin</HI> are thus at Enmity, there may be the &s;ame between the principal <HI>Formo&s;ans</HI> and the&s;e Coa&s;ters; and that &s;ince the <HI>Dutch</HI> could not get this &s;mall I&s;land, much le&s;s the great I&s;land of <HI>Formo&s;a</HI>, tho' they had the Coa&s;ters to help them.</P>
<P N="12">12. And accordingly we find one <HI>Junius</HI> ma|king great Conver&s;ions upon <HI>Formo&s;a, Anno</HI> 1640. But it was among the People of <HI>Sincan</HI>, and the other Towns named by <HI>Candidius</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">The Account in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> by <HI>H. Je&s;&s;e. Lond.</HI> 1650.</NOTE>. So that the principal Inhabitants are left unconverted and unknown.</P>
<P N="13">13. And when the <HI>Dutch</HI> were driven from <HI>For|mo&s;a</HI> by <HI>Coxinga</HI>, it is plain, <HI>Coxinga</HI> &s;udued at that time no more than the <HI>Dutch</HI> Settlement<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> the Account of this in <HI>Baldeus, apud Churchil</HI>. Vol. 3. Pag. 633.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There is an odd Story told of this Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Coxinga</HI> by more Authors than one, as if he made <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> his Refuge, when he was driven out of <HI>China</HI> by the <HI>Tartar</HI>; and if it were &s;o, then <HI>For|mo&s;a</HI> mu&s;t be under <HI>China</HI> then and &s;ince. But this Story &s;eems told on purpo&s;e to hide a Su&s;pi|cion of &s;ome ill Practices of the <HI>Dutch</HI>, for the Fact was thus; at that time.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="19"><HI>Coxinga</HI> had &s;ent two Ships of Money from the South Part of <HI>China</HI> by Sea, to pay his Taxes in the North; the&s;e Ships were intercepted, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> of <HI>Tayavan</HI> had or were &s;u&s;pected to have had a Hand in the Bu&s;ine&s;s. Upon this <HI>Coxinga</HI> draws down a mighty Force to the I&s;les of <HI>Ey</HI> and <HI>Quemoy</HI>, over again&s;t <HI>Tayavan</HI>. This gives Umbrage to the Governour of <HI>Tayavan</HI>, he obtains a Squadron of Men of War from <HI>Batavia</HI>, and &s;ends an Envoy <HI>(John Newhoffe)</HI> to <HI>Coxinga</HI> to know his De&s;ign in his Preparations.</P>
<P><HI>Coxinga</HI> amu&s;es 'em with a Letter &s;ent to the Go|vernour, upon which he &s;ends back the Squadron, and then <HI>Coxinga</HI> routed 'em from <HI>Tayavan</HI>, and from <HI>Sincan</HI>, and al&s;o <HI>Formo&s;a</HI>.</P>
<P>Now this was the Occa&s;ion of <HI>Coxinga</HI>'s expel|ling the <HI>Dutch</HI>, and not that he might make his retreat thither.</P>
<P>He could not then think of &s;uch a Place as <HI>Tayavan</HI> to retreat to, he calls it in his Letter <HI>An incon&s;i|derable I&s;land that produces nothing but Gra&s;s</HI>, a Character agreeing with it but not with <HI>Formo&s;a</HI>, which it's plain he never aimed at <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide Newhoffe</HI>'s Voyages <HI>apud Churchill</HI>. Vol. 2. P. 204.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>And now one would admire that all our People of <HI>Europe</HI> &s;hould not mind the Difference &s;o plain|ly expre&s;s'd by <HI>Candidius</HI>, and ob&s;erved by all the Authors &s;ince; but it &s;eems the <HI>Dutch</HI> had named <HI>Tayavan Formo&s;a</HI>, and &s;o it mu&s;t be called. But for our Parts, unle&s;s the modern <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> extend it &s;elf farther than that of <HI>Candidius</HI>, we are &s;till, as we think, ju&s;t where we were, when we part|ed with that hone&s;t Gentleman.</P>
<P N="14">14. It is many Years &s;ince the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had a &s;ort of a Factory upon <HI>Tayavan</HI>, but our Com|merce extended not &s;o far as the <HI>Dutch</HI>, not far
<PB N="11" REF="20">
enough upon the main I&s;land of <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> to di&s;co|ver any Rivers; which yet, one would think, might have been di&s;cover'd without going far up the Country. We have an Account of this Factory of ours in the two following Letters from a Gen|tleman who has been there.</P>
<P>The Gentleman who wrote 'em expre&s;s'd no De&s;ire to have 'em kept private, and he who re|ceiv'd 'em, &s;hew'd 'em to any body, and they are all already as publick as they well can be, even by this our putting 'em in print. For that Rea&s;on, and becau&s;e the&s;e Letters have occa&s;ion'd great Mi&s;takes about <HI>Formo&s;a</HI>, for want of the Di|&s;tinction afore&s;aid, it is nece&s;&s;ary the World &s;hould &s;ee 'em. They have occa&s;ion'd mighty Su&s;|picion about <HI>P&s;&mdash;r</HI>, and &s;hould they be now corrected, our Enquiry could not be made about the Rea&s;ons of the Su&s;picions hence occa&s;ion'd. Therefore we hope we may be pardon'd, though we cannot &s;uppo&s;e he intended 'em for the Pub|lick, yet it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to make 'em publick; and we dur&s;t not ask leave, le&s;t he &s;hould in&s;i&s;t to correct 'em.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e they are thus publi&s;h'd without leave, we thought our &s;elves obliged to omit the Names, but they who have heard of any Letters &s;ent from <HI>Suffolk</HI> about <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> may be a&s;&s;ur'd the&s;e are the Letters; and indeed the&s;e are all the Letters, that we can learn, ever were &s;ent from any one in <HI>England</HI> to any one in <HI>London</HI> a|bout <HI>Formo&s;a</HI>.</P>

<P><Q>&startq;IN an&s;wer to your Queries of the 29<HI>th</HI> pa&s;t to the be&s;t of my Remembrance. The Dimen&s;ion, (&s;uppo&s;e Circumference) of the I&s;le <HI>Formo&s;a</HI>, I am not able to a&s;certain. It is com|monly reputed large. <HI>Francoy</HI> of Southermo&s;t Land is very high to be &s;een. I have heard Mariners &s;ay 40 or 50 Leagues of in about 23 Degrees. <HI>Keylong</HI> the North part in about 27. The Soil Clay, but more Sand, which is the Rea&s;on that the frequent Earth-quakes finding the Ground porous do not the Damage as in other places. It is very mountanous midland to the Ea&s;tward. I believe no Chri&s;tians trade with the <HI>Formo&s;ans</HI>, neither heard of any Prohibition. (9) The Habits of what I have &s;een is meer Para|dice, &s;ome, I hear, wear a Linnen Clout, or &s;ome Skin; as for Bears and other <HI>ferae naturae</HI>, I re|member no Di&s;cour&s;es. This I am &s;atisfied of, that no I&s;land abounds more with Deer, which at a Sea&s;on, the piratical <HI>Chine&s;e</HI>, that were Ma&s;ters of the place, hunt, with the help of the <HI>Formo&s;ans</HI>, killing, as them&s;elves have &s;aid 10000: The Fle&s;h is cut into pieces &s;alted and dried in the Sun, and is called <HI>Loeba</HI>, that is Deer's Fle&s;h, &s;erves them at Sea in their Voy|ages. The Skins are carefully dried, and a &s;ta+ple Commodity at <HI>Japan</HI>. I have not heard of any Coins the <HI>Formo&s;ans</HI> have. Some Bars not many, I have &s;een of twenty three Carats but no other Mettal. The Produce is Sugar in Quantities, as well, (I think better) grain'd than <HI>Brazile</HI>. Sugar Candy white and brown

They are &s;o far, I am of Opinion, from any Lectures in Greek or Latin, that I que&s;tion whether any <HI>Formo&s;an</HI> knows what either word means, never heard of any thing, like <HI>China</HI> or <HI>Japan</HI> Ware made there.

<P>The&s;e are the Letters which we hope we have Liberty to read over again, and make two Ob&s;erva|tions upon 'em.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t</HI>, We think they do not contradict <HI>P&mdash;r</HI>'s Account.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly</HI>, We think they partly confirm it.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t</HI>, The <HI>Emporium</HI> is <HI>Tyavan</HI>, the then Fa|ctory of the Engli&s;h, (n^o (2) (10). The extent or rather Confinement of our Merchants upon that Factory, not admitting the Knowlege of any Rivers (n^o (3) nor Towns (n^o (4) &s;hews that
<PB N="16" REF="25">
we did not go &s;o far upon the main I&s;land of <HI>For|mo&s;a</HI>, as the <HI>Dutch</HI> heretofore, who had Com|merce in eight Towns, and were re&s;trained by the &s;ame Bounds as <HI>the Coa&s;ters</HI> them&s;elves. The Name by which the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Merchants call this Place <HI>Sonvenchou</HI>, is either <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> or <HI>Malayan</HI>, if the fir&s;t, then it mu&s;t mean the part of <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> belonging to the <HI>Coa&s;ters</HI> for we have already proved the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> call the whole I&s;land <HI>Paccando</HI>. But if the word be <HI>Mallayan</HI>, as we rather con|clude, becau&s;e they call the People by a <HI>Mallayan</HI> Name (n^o 6) then we are to &s;eek whether they mean <HI>Tayavan</HI> or <HI>Formo&s;a</HI>. For the <HI>Mallayan</HI> is a &s;ort of <HI>Lingua Franca</HI>, a Language made by Agreement of the trading People of the Ea&s;t. And then we may conclude <HI>Sonvenchew</HI> to be the Name of the <HI>Emporium</HI>, and that is <HI>Tayavan</HI> &s;ays our Author of the&s;e Letters (n^o (2). And the Rea|&s;on this Gentleman gives that <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> does not belong to <HI>Japan</HI>, becau&s;e the <HI>Japone&s;e</HI> have no Navy, and the Subjects don't go abroad, (n^o (5) we think &s;hews his &s;mall Knowledge of the true Governours thereof. Had he certainly known the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> have the whole, he need not have added this Rea&s;on, which we think no Argument, be|cau&s;e the <HI>Japone&s;e</HI> Emperor mu&s;t have a Navy &s;ufficient to manage his own Empire, that being made up of many I&s;lands, and he may &s;end this Navy out, &s;o that we think the&s;e Letters contain+ing an Account of <HI>Tayavan</HI> does not contradict <HI>P&s;&mdash;r</HI>'s Account of <HI>Formo&s;a</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly</HI>, Some things in the&s;e Letters we judge confirm his Account. Such is the Character of <HI>Formo&s;a</HI>, that it is a large and plentiful I&s;land (n^o (1) And therefore could not be <HI>the Place whence</HI> Coxinga <HI>expelled the</HI> Dutch, for that was <HI>Tayavan a barren I&s;land bearing nothing but Gra&s;s</HI>

<P><HI>Secondly</HI>, We have a concuring Te&s;timony. The noble Prince <HI>John Albert Lubomirski</HI>, one who has been twelve Years a Mi&s;&s;ionar in <HI>China</HI>, of the Order of the Franci&s;cans, and during that time was three Years with one <HI>Ba&s;ilius</HI> a Mi&s;&s;ionar of that Order, and now Bi&s;hop of <HI>Xanton</HI> in <HI>China</HI>. The Bi&s;hop has been there about forty Years, and during that &s;pace was upon <HI>Formo&s;a</HI>. This <HI>Lu|bomirski</HI> being now a Prote&s;tant, came hither upon the Recommendation of the Anti&s;tes of <HI>Zuric</HI>, a Per&s;on of good Authority well known to my Lord of <HI>London</HI>. It was as &s;oon as he came hither, that this Account was given by him. He was no way led into any Particulars of it. The Conver&s;ation was managed by one Mr. <HI>B.</HI> a <HI>Dutch</HI> Man, one that had no Opinion of <HI>P&s;&mdash;r</HI> till he heard what <HI>Lubomirsky</HI> affirmed of <HI>Formo|&s;a</HI>. Mr. <HI>B.</HI> was to wait upon him by Order from a Gentleman beyond Sea; and as &s;oon as he had declared the Occa&s;ion of his coming, po&s;tponed his own Bu&s;ine&s;s, and inquired whether <HI>Lubomir|ski</HI> knew <HI>Formo&s;a?</HI> when he heard he knew the place, he asked farther, whether he had been upon it? but finding he had not, he enquir'd the
<PB N="20" REF="29">
Rea&s;on &mdash;<HI>Lubomirsky</HI> &s;aid it was becau&s;e <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> was not under <HI>China</HI>, but under <HI>Japan</HI>, and by the Laws of <HI>Japan</HI>; no Chri&s;tian may come thi|ther on pain of Death. Mr. <HI>B.</HI> was &s;urprized to hear this, but <HI>Lubomirski</HI> affirmed it, and went on to tell &s;everal things more; agreeing with <HI>P&s;&mdash;r</HI> in all he &s;aid.</P>
<P>Upon which he was de&s;ired to give us the&s;e Par|ticulars in Writing, which he promi&s;ed, and after|wards in part performed. He writ in Latin, but we have put it into <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>, and left the Latin Copy at the Book&s;ellers for any one to compare our Ver|&s;ion with it. <HI>Lubomirsky</HI> had not &s;een <HI>P&s;&mdash;r</HI> when he told us the Particulars, that induced us to de&s;ire his writing 'em. And tho' indeed he did &s;ee him before he gave us the Paper, yet the Dif|ferences between his and <HI>P&s;&mdash;r</HI>'s Account are &s;ufficient to &s;hew they had no Combination.</P>
<P>We wi&s;h <HI>Lubomirsky</HI> had made good the Character given him by the Anti&s;tes of <HI>Zuric</HI>, for he pretended to him that he would go back to convert the Popi&s;h <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> to the Pro|te&s;tant Religion, which he has now made impra|cticable by his Marriage; but &s;till he is as we think, a credible Witne&s;s in this Ca&s;e. He had no manner of &s;ugge&s;tions to tell a Lye; he was de&s;ired to &s;ay the truth; he has &s;ince adhered to his Te&s;timony, tho' he has had Temptation to &s;neak out of it, and whil&s;t he was in Town, had no manner of Promi&s;es from any of us to induce his &s;tanding to it. And we are content any Body, i$ they can, &s;hould induce him to retract it, and the$ we will not rely upon it. And therefore tho' w$ &s;hould admit him lap&s;ed into Faults, not con&s;i+&s;tent with his Character, does that weaken thi$ Te&s;timony? at this rate, what Cau&s;es can be tr$+ed till the Day of Judgment?

<P>Their chief Idol is called <HI>Moloch</HI>, made of pure Gold, and placed in the middle of the City. Every Year they &s;acrifice Children to it very &s;olemnly in this manner. (1) They make the Idol very hot, them (2) the Sacrificers and Soldiers for three Days toge|ther, dance, &s;ing, beat Drums, and play divers fooli&s;h Tricks, &s;ome about the Idol, others about the Chil|dren to be &s;acrificed.

<PB N="23" REF="32">
They that Day dre&s;s the Children in very rich cloaths, &s;et out with Gold and Jewels, and put 'em into a triumphal Chariot. Some of the Sacrificers and Soldiers are placed about this Chariot, and weep bitterly, and make lamentable Moan, others &s;ing before the Chariot, others follow it with the Mul|titude drumming, playing upon Cymbals, and Trum|pets, and upon Trumpets &s;ix Cubits long. When they come to the Idol, and have fini&s;h'd their Rites, the Chief Prie&s;t takes the Infants out of the Cha|riot, and puts 'em into the burning Idol, which immediately con&s;umes 'em. And to prevent their Parents and Kindred from hearing their Cries, Some beat Drums, others &s;ing, &s;ome dance, others cry and play fooli&s;h Tricks.</P>

The manner of the Sacrifice is thus, One of the Prie&s;ts holds him by the Head, another by the Tail, and a third cuts off his Head with a Sword; the Fle&s;h they di&s;tribute among them&s;elves, and eat it raw with great Devotion; then with the Blood they &s;prinkle their Weapons, their Hou&s;es, Temples, and City-Walls; and are per&s;uaded

Each of who&s;e Brea&s;ts the Chief Prie&s;t at one Blow cleaves a&s;under, and pulls out his Heart, fre&s;h, and yet alive; then the Corps are carried out with great Solemnity to a Place for that Purpo&s;e, where they are burnt with divers &s;uper&s;titious Ceremo|nies, and the Per&s;ons thus offered are reputed Saints.

<P>If they who give the Cau&s;e of Separation be the Separati&s;ts, then we think it proved over and over by our Writers, that the Papi&s;ts &s;eparate from us and not we from them. Tho' to &s;peak properly, the Church of <HI>England</HI> did not make any Separa|tion at all. She only Reformed, as &s;he both might and ought. But, indeed, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Papi&s;ts are Separati&s;ts to all intents, they &s;eparate from their own Bi&s;hops, with whom they ought to commu|nicate, and to whom it is their undoubted Duty to pay canonical Obedience, and yet they make this Seperation at the Command of a Bi&s;hop, who has no Authority over 'em at all. Thus having di&s;patcht the Queries we hope.</P>
<P>The Conclu&s;ion of all will be that your Criticks will both be &s;atisfied that <HI>P&mdash;r</HI> is a <HI>Formo&s;an</HI>, and a true Convert to that Church, to which it is <HI>your and their</HI> indi&s;pen&s;able Duty faithfully to

<P>Thus having di&s;po&s;ed of this Squadron of Ob|jections, we are at lea&s;ure to meet the re&s;t, which are mo&s;t of 'em &s;ingle, and therefore for the Rea|ders greater &s;atisfaction we &s;hall put 'em in the Order of <HI>P&mdash;r</HI>'s Hi&s;tory as it came out in the &s;econd Edition.</P>
<P N="1">1. It has been urged, that Pere Fountenay, <HI>when in</HI> London, <HI>affirmed</HI> Formo&s;a <HI>to be under</HI> China, <HI>and that he &s;aw in</HI> China <HI>a</HI> Mandarin <HI>go|ing thither</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> We admit this, as to <HI>Tayavan</HI>, which <HI>Pere Fountenay</HI> &s;ays, was the I&s;le he meant. But this we have proved to be di&s;tinct from our <HI>For|mo&s;a</HI>, which the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> call <HI>Paccando</HI>.</P>
<P N="2">2. Some &s;ay <HI>the Habits P&mdash;r</HI> gives us are all a Fiction, and &s;uch as the Stage Players u&s;e, and taken thence. Others that <HI>the Cro&s;&s;es upon the bottom of the Queen's Petticoat</HI>, are a mark of the Papi&s;t in <HI>P&mdash;r</HI>, and if not yet more incon&s;i|&s;tent with that Abhorrence of the Cro&s;s he tells us of in <HI>Japan</HI> and <HI>Formo&s;a</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> When we inquired about this, <HI>P&mdash;r</HI> tells us he gave only general Directions to the Engra|ver, who added &s;ome Ornaments to the Habits; and tho&s;e Cro&s;&s;es in particular of his own accord, and that he had put one of the Ladies a Cro&s;s of Diamonds upon her Brea&s;t, but <HI>P&mdash;r</HI> made it be put out, tho' it &s;eems the&s;e were not mended by him.</P>
<P N="3">3. We have been told <HI>the Revenue of the Angon or King of</HI> Formo&s;a, is incredible, being 400000 Copans, each weighing one Pound of Gold.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w. P&s;&mdash;r</HI> in this very Book tells us, that a Copan, tho' of that weight is but of 30<HI>s.</HI> Value, and then the Revenue pay'd by the Emperour of <HI>Japan</HI> to this his Deputy of <HI>Formo&s;a</HI>, is but
<PB N="36" REF="45">
600000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling <HI>per Annum</HI>. And the Depu|ty maintains the Army of 15000 Soldiers, and pays the General 105000 <HI>per Annum</HI> out of it. Neither is this great Salary any Charge to <HI>Japan</HI>, becau&s;e the third part of the Mines, all the Cu&s;toms, and all the Tribute of the Knognioskaas, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are pay'd to the Emperor, and amount to much more.</P>
<P N="3">3. There <HI>is a Grammar of the</HI> Japan <HI>Language in Town</HI>, from whence &s;ome words have been tran&s;crib'd and &s;hew'd <HI>P&mdash;r</HI>, but he knew nothing of 'em, tho' he &s;ays his Language is a Dialect of the <HI>Japan</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> We find the <HI>Japan</HI> Language has Dialects not very intelligible to the Natives them&s;elves, by the Account given by <HI>Varenius</HI> of it out of <HI>Maffeus, Sermo Japponen&s;ium unus</HI>, &amp;c. <HI>There is one com|mon Language of all</HI> Japan, <HI>but &s;o different and manifold, that they may very well be accounted ma|ny; there being many ways of expre&s;&s;ing the &s;ame things. One way for contempt, another way for Re&s;pect: One way with the Court, another way with the People, one way for the Men, another way for the Women. Add, that they write one way, and &s;peak another; and in their Writing they have one way for Letters, and another for Books, Varen. Ch.</HI> 25<HI>th.</HI> Now if this be &s;o a Native of <HI>Japan</HI> mu&s;t be &s;poke too in his <HI>proper Dialect</HI>, and the words mu&s;t be pronounced <HI>by proper Rules</HI>, pecu|liar to the <HI>general</HI> and <HI>particular</HI> Method of Wri|ting, before they can be under&s;tood by a Native. So tho' we go no farther here, we could not think this any Objection.</P>
<P N="4">4. There is a <HI>Ver&s;ion of the Lord's Prayer</HI> in a Book extant, called <HI>the Lord's Prayer in a hundred Languages</HI>, which Book <HI>P&mdash;r</HI> refers to in his fir&s;t Preface, and yet this Ver&s;ion is quite different from that of <HI>P&mdash;r</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="46"><HI>An&s;w.</HI> We find this Ver&s;ion to be of the Lan|guage of the <HI>Formo&s;an Coa&s;ters</HI>, the People of <HI>Sinkan, &amp;c.</HI> for it agrees very much with that which <HI>Grevius</HI> has tran&s;lated for tho&s;e People, as may appear to any one who will be at the pains to compare 'em. And as for the Differences between 'em, it mu&s;t allow'd. (1.) That the Language of the&s;e People being taken by <HI>Grevius</HI> and others from Pronunciation only, mu&s;t be written by our Europeans diver&s;ely according to our different manner of Writing the &s;ame Word, when expre&s;t by People of divers Countries, if we &s;pell as they &s;peak. And hence it is not probable that we &s;pell the <HI>Formo&s;an</HI> Words the &s;ame way. (2) It is pro|bable that <HI>Grevius</HI> who under&s;tood both the Peo|ple, and al&s;o the Language &s;o very well as to be able to teach it to others, took &s;ome Pains to ren|der the Lord's Prayer rather by way of Paraphra&s;e and not literally. And hence it may be the Tran|&s;lation in his Catechi&s;m has more Words than that in the Book fir&s;t mentioned. And (3.) if this be &s;o, it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to render &s;ome of the Words diver&s;ly even where we might ex|pect the &s;ame. Thus for In&s;tance, tho' both a|gree in the fir&s;t Sentence, u&s;ing the Word [<HI>Vullum</HI>] And one of 'em afterwards u&s;es the &s;ame Word about the Place where in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> we repeat the word [<HI>Heaven</HI>], which makes us &s;uppo&s;e the Word <HI>Vullum</HI> to &s;ignifie <HI>Heaven</HI>, yet the other does not repeat it, but has more Words than one in that place, which we take to be a Pa|raphra&s;e either <HI>of the place</HI> or the <HI>Inhabitants of Heaven</HI>.</P>
<P>And therefore we conclude (as &s;ome who doubt of <HI>P&s;&mdash;r</HI> have done before us) that the Ver&s;ion of the Lord's Prayer in both Books, namely that of the Lord's Prayer in one hundred Languages, and
<PB N="38" REF="47">
that in <HI>Grevius</HI>'s Catechi&s;m is the &s;ame Lan|guage.</P>
<P>And we know the latter is the Language of the <HI>Formo&s;an</HI> Coa&s;ters. The People which <HI>Candidius</HI> and all our People &s;peak of. And therefore our Judgment of the former is this.</P>
<P>Tho' we admit this Ver&s;ion to be <HI>Formo&s;an</HI>, yet it does not affect <HI>P&mdash;r</HI> any more than <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> does <HI>the Engli&s;h</HI>.</P>
<P N="5">5. It has been objected that <HI>P&mdash;r</HI> has been caught once <HI>by giving a different Name to a</HI> Chine&s;e <HI>Coin, when &s;hewn by a different Hand</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> We have inquired into the matter, and find it thus.</P>
<P>There are two &s;orts of <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> &s;mall Coins <HI>in|ter alia</HI> current at <HI>Formo&s;a</HI>, one Copper &s;tampt but on one &s;ide, called <HI>Bingo</HI>, the other Bra&s;s &s;tampt on both &s;ides, called <HI>Khoudyin</HI>.</P>
<P>The Piece &s;hew'd <HI>P&s;&mdash;r</HI> has no Rever&s;e, and yet is Bra&s;s, tho' it looks reddi&s;h like Copper, and therefore <HI>P&mdash;r</HI> now judges it to be &s;ome Copy made by our Medal Copiers.</P>
<P>When it was &s;hew'd him the fir&s;t time he judg|ed it by the Mettal, which being, as he thought, Bra&s;s, he never examin'd the Rever&s;e, and &s;aid it was a <HI>Khoudyin</HI>. When it was &s;hew'd him again, he examin'd it, and thought the Impre&s;&s;ion the true way to di&s;tingui&s;h the Mettal, which ap|pear'd then in a full light dubious, and &s;aid it was a <HI>Bingo</HI>.</P>
<P>This we have to &s;ay, that we have other Pieces of much the &s;ame &s;ort of <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Coins, but they are perfect Bra&s;s, and &s;tampt on both &s;ides. And we have obtained this very Piece from the Gentle|man who fir&s;t &s;hew'd it, and it has a Ca&s;t of the Copper. We have left all with the Book&s;eller for farther Satisfaction.</P>

Which Narrative we thus tran&s;late for their &s;akes who do not read <HI>French</HI>.</P>
<LETTER>
<P><Q>&startq;IT was about 5 Years ago, being then in <HI>Orange</HI>, I was told by a Merchant of <HI>Avignion</HI>, that there was in that City a <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> lately arrived, who &s;poke Latin. I de&s;ired that Merchant, who was to go back, to contrive &s;ome way to bring him to <HI>Orange</HI>, being not a|bove 4 Leagues off. He promi&s;ed it, but at his Return &s;ent me Word that the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> had withdrawn him&s;elf from thence, no body knew &endq;whither.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="52">
<Q>&startq;About two Years after [this] I was driven from <HI>Orange</HI> by the Per&s;ecution of the <HI>French</HI> King, and came to <HI>England</HI> to &s;olicit a Colle|ction for the Refugees of that Principality, and under&s;tood that the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> I heard of at <HI>Orange</HI> was then in <HI>London</HI>. I had the Curio&s;ity to &s;ee him, <HI>and after divers Conver&s;ations which I had with him, I knew that he had effectually been at</HI> Avignion, <HI>and that he was the &s;ame Man I was told of</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Reader will plea&s;e to remember this Te&s;timony, for <HI>P&s;&mdash;r</HI> is <HI>po&s;itive</HI> as to his <HI>being at</HI> Avignion, <HI>being there reputed a</HI> Chine&s;e, <HI>and thither then lately arrived</HI>, and <HI>thence privately withdrawn</HI>. And we &s;ubmit it, whether any thing but <HI>like po&s;itive and direct Proof</HI> of the contrary can invalidate this.</NOTE>. But he told me he was not a <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> &endq;but a <HI>Jappone&s;e</HI>, a Native of the I&s;le <HI>Formo&s;a</HI>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;There was then a great Di&s;cour&s;e in Town about that young Man, and every body was willing to know the Truth of his Story. And I was order'd by divers Per&s;ons of Quality, and particularly by my Lord&mdash;of&mdash;, to inform my &s;elf as exactly as I could; and in particular, whether it was true that one <HI>Pere de Rhode</HI>, a Je&s;uit, had arrived at <HI>Avignion</HI> &endq;from <HI>Formo&s;a</HI>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;And becau&s;e I knew Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Lubieres</HI>, the la&s;t Governour of <HI>Orange</HI>, was then at <HI>Ge|neva</HI>, and had divers Friends and Acquaintance at <HI>Avignion</HI>.

<P><Q>&startq;Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Lubieres</HI> &s;ent me tho&s;e Letters, which I delivered to my Lord&mdash;of&mdash; who keeps 'em. This is all I can &s;ay in Par|&endq;ticular of this young Man<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vid.</HI> Object. 11.</NOTE>.</Q></P>

<P><Q>&startq;The other Reflections which I have made, and which make me believe the young Man in|vented his Hi&s;tory<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">It appears already <HI>he did not invent</HI> all <HI>his Hi&s;tory</HI>; his be|ing at <HI>Avignion</HI> is part of it, and that this Gentleman an&s;wers for.</NOTE>, are what all the World &endq;may make, and therefore I pa&s;s 'em by.</Q></P>
<P>Now any Body that reads this Account of the&s;e Letters, will wonder they could ever prejudice
<PB N="45" REF="54">
<HI>P&s;&mdash;r</HI> at all. (1) <HI>That he was at Avignon</HI> all <HI>Orange</HI> knew. (2) <HI>That he e&s;cap'd thence</HI> this Merchant te&s;tifies. (3) <HI>That</HI> P&s;&mdash;r <HI>was the Man who was there</HI>, and thus e&s;cap'd, this Gentleman is &s;atisfied; and yet this <HI>P&s;&mdash;r</HI> mu&s;t be an Im|po&s;tor, becau&s;e one <HI>Pere de Rhode</HI> a Mi&s;&s;ioner died at <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> twenty Years ago, and <HI>another Pere de Rhode</HI>, who is now in the College, never was a Mi&s;&s;ionar; but it does not &s;ay that there was no Mi&s;&s;ionar at all, either of that or any o|ther Name, who came from <HI>Goa</HI> or <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> the time named by <HI>P&mdash;r</HI>, and brought with him this or any other <HI>Formo&s;an</HI>. Strange! <HI>That &s;uch an imperfect An&s;wer &s;hould be allow'd to &s;tifle &s;uch a known Truth.</HI> But we think that no An&s;wer whatever, from a Je&s;uit, &s;hould be admitted in a Cau&s;e in which they are alarm'd, that it mu&s;t be to their Prejudice to &s;peak Truth, in which they are told the <HI>Queen of</HI> England <HI>is plea&s;ed to concern her&s;elf</HI>, &s;ince no Prote&s;tant would hang a Dog upon &s;uch Evidence. Had the An&s;wer been per|fect, we know they can deny a Name; but when their An&s;wer is &s;o very imperfect, &s;o very Je&s;ui|tical, what Credit can we give it?</P>
<P><HI>Note</HI>, The Original Account under the Gentle|man's Hand, who wrote to <HI>Geneva</HI>, is at the Book&s;eller's for Satisfaction.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>Why do you not write again?</HI> &s;ay others.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> The Je&s;uits are now alarm'd, and will go thorow &s;titch. Had <HI>P&s;&mdash;r</HI> been acquain|ted with their Writing, he could have directed 'em to &s;ome body would have told Truth; but now, we fear, the Je&s;uits will over-awe every body there.</P>
<P N="11">11. This very Gentleman &s;ays, it appears to him, <HI>That</HI> P&s;&mdash;r <HI>learn'd Latin from a</HI> Dutch <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="55"><HI>An&s;w.</HI> The Language of <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> chiefly em|ploys tho&s;e Organs of Speech, which becau&s;e they are about the Throat, we ask leave to call <HI>Guttural</HI>. The &s;everal Languages of <HI>Europe</HI> make principal U&s;e of the other Organs, and for the mo&s;t part differ from each other. Some u&s;e the Lips more, &s;ome le&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now &s;ince <HI>P&s;&mdash;r</HI> &s;peaks both the <HI>Formo&s;an</HI>, and mo&s;t of the <HI>Euro|pean</HI> Languages; his pronouncing every one mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be a little toucht with an Accent which re&s;ults from all the re&s;t. And tho' in &s;ome Latin words he may more imitate one &s;ort of Pronun|ciation than in others, yet it requires better skill than mo&s;t Men pretend to in any who, in this ca&s;e, relie upon the manner of <HI>P&mdash;r</HI>'s Pro|nunciation as a Mark &s;ufficient to di&s;tingui&s;h his Country.</P>
<P N="11">11. Others object <HI>P&mdash;r's Ignorance of the</HI> Chine&s;e <HI>Language</HI>, which they take to be the po|lite Language of tho&s;e Parts of the Ea&s;t, as <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Europe</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> But <HI>Varenius</HI> tells us, the <HI>Jappone&s;e</HI> have an utter Aver&s;ion for the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI>. <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Varen. Lib. 1. Cap. 3.</NOTE> And therefore we cannot &s;uppo&s;e this to be an Obje|ction. It confirms him in our an Opinion.</P>
<P N="12">12. Some object his <HI>Staying here</HI>, as an Argument he never came from <HI>Formo&s;a</HI>, for then &s;ay they, he would de&s;ire to return and convert his Friends. Others on the contrary think <HI>his de&s;iring to re|turn</HI>, upon an Attempt &s;o very di&s;couraging, looks as if he meant to re&s;tore him&s;elf to Pagani&s;m.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w. To the fir&s;t of the&s;e</HI>, we beg leave to af|firm his Return is concerted, and will be effected in proper time. And we hope <HI>the &s;econd</HI> will be convinced by the happy Effects that nothing but
<PB N="47" REF="56">
the Hopes of the Conver&s;ion of <HI>Formo&s;a</HI>, and all the good Con&s;equences of that have moved <HI>P&mdash;r</HI> to think of returning to his own Country.</P>
<P N="12">12. His Zeal for the Church of which he is a Member, has induced him <HI>to medle in our Contro|ver&s;y. And this</HI> is alledged by &s;ome as an Argu|ment, of his being in the Intere&s;t of <HI>Rome</HI>, who&s;e Policy to de&s;troy us by Divi&s;ions is known to eve|ry Body.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> But for our Parts, we think otherwi&s;e, and becau&s;e the Di&s;cernment of &s;uch as we may be que&s;tioned, we here &s;ubjoin our Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t</HI>, The Rule we take to know <HI>the Friends of</HI> Rome in any Controver&s;ie about Religion is <HI>the depreciating the Divine Authority of the holy Scrip|tures</HI>. For unle&s;s Mankind could be per&s;uaded to lay a&s;ide all Religion, we take it, they will na|turally fly to the greate&s;t Authority in religious Matters. And we do not know any that bids &s;o fair for this greate&s;t Authority as <HI>Rome</HI>, if the ho|ly Scriptures could be lay'd a&s;ide.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly</HI>, And by this Rule we judge <HI>P&mdash;r</HI> no Friend to <HI>Rome</HI>. For his Arguments, all tend to prove the divine Authority of the holy Scriptures, parti|cularly his Dialogue lately publi&s;h'd, which can be prov'd to be wrote by him&s;elf, without any other In&s;tigation than Love to Truth.</P>
<P>So that if by any impo&s;&s;ible Suppo&s;ition we ad|mit <HI>P&mdash;r</HI> in the Intere&s;t of <HI>Rome</HI>, we mu&s;t at the &s;ame time admit him to carry on his De|&s;igns by Means directly de&s;tructive of any end he can propo&s;e for the Service of <HI>Rome</HI>.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the material Objections we at any time met, which are reduceable to this Head, &s;ave only Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI>'s Book, and that we have re|ferred to <HI>P&mdash;r</HI> him&s;elf. It contains a&s;&s;er|tion of Facts, which are propere&s;t for him to an|&s;wer;
<PB N="48" REF="57">
&s;ince Mr. <HI>Innes</HI> is ab&s;ent. And therefore we proceed to the la&s;t Head of Objections again&s;t him.</P>
<P N="3">&sect;. III. And here we confe&s;s our &s;elves at the greate&s;t lo&s;s: His Hair &s;hould be black; his Face yellow, or Olive, or Tawny; his Mien a little more diver&s;e from any, to denote him &s;uch a Stran|ger as he pretends.</P>
<P>But we con&s;ider here that in all places there are &s;ome who are contrary to the general Co|lour, &amp;c. of the Country. Some fair in <HI>Afric</HI>, &s;ome black in <HI>England</HI>.</P>
<P>And as to his Hair we know not what Influence the Climate he is now in, may have upon the Co|lour of that. We find many here, who&s;e Hair changes from white to black, and then to white, and this in different Years of their Ages, as the vigour of their Bodies has increa&s;ed and decayed. Hence we argue, that this Climate may have &s;ome Effect upon <HI>P&mdash;r</HI>'s Body, and con&s;equently upon the Colour of his Hair; different from his native Country, and &s;o too upon the Colour of his Skin.</P>
<P>The Features of his Face are plainly different from any of <HI>Europe</HI>, and by them he was known to be of <HI>India</HI> by an ingenious Gentleman, who has been many Years there.</P>
<P>And his Soul the principal Part of him, if that may be &s;aid to be a part, which has in it &s;elf no parts, is certainly agreeable to the Character of the <HI>Japone&s;e</HI>.</P>
<P>Such a ready Apprehen&s;ion, &s;uch an Accuracy in guiding his Judgment; &s;uch a con&s;tant adhere|ing to what he judges right; &s;uch Contempt of the World and all its Promi&s;es, and Threats when they interpo&s;e, and would bya&s;s his Judg+ment,
<PB N="49" REF="58">
are indeed to be found in <HI>Japan</HI> common enough, even natural to the Inhabitants of that Empire. But if the Character of the People of <HI>Europe</HI> (our Queen's Dominions being excluded) may be taken from their natural and acquired En|dowments, and their Steddine&s;s to that Truth which contradicts their Intere&s;ts, we may venture any Body to prove <HI>P&mdash;r</HI> has a <HI>European</HI> Soul, let his Body be of what part of the World &s;oever, unle&s;s he be of our country, as &s;ome are plea&s;ed to affirm.</P>
<P>And now we may expect it will be inquired <HI>how P&mdash;r came to be at all &s;u&s;pected</HI>, &s;ince all the Objections again&s;t him are &s;o very ea&s;ily an|&s;wer'd? And truly we find this the harder Que|&s;tion to re&s;olve, unle&s;s we may be allowed to &s;ay <HI>His fir&s;t Enemies were the Je&s;uits, and to them chiefly the Lo&s;s of his Reputation is owing</HI>. And this Opinion we are induced to by the Rea&s;ons fol|lowing.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> It was <HI>Pere Fountenay a Je&s;uit</HI>, who made the fir&s;t Oppo&s;ition again&s;t him before the Royal Society; and who there &s;hew'd a re&s;olve to contradict every thing <HI>P&mdash;r</HI> &s;hould a&s;&s;ert, and carry'd on this Re&s;olve to affirming even that which every one knew to be fal&s;e. He deny'd the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> to have any Words ending with a Con&s;onant, that he might deny <HI>P&mdash;r</HI>'s &s;aying the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> call <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> Pac-Ando, <HI>i. e.</HI> the beautiful I&s;land. Tho' by the way we prove they do by Authorities indubitable, and tho' the Names of their own Cities, <HI>Canton, Xanton, Nan|king, Peking</HI>, &amp;c. all ending with Con&s;onants, abundantly confute the Je&s;uit.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly</HI>, It is <HI>the Je&s;uits</HI> who would have <HI>P&mdash;r</HI> to be an Impo&s;tor, becau&s;e as they &s;ay <HI>one</HI> Pere de Rhode <HI>is no Mini&s;&s;ionar</HI>, as is noted
<PB N="50" REF="59">
already, tho' do but in&s;inuate this by an An&s;wer purely Je&s;uitical.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly</HI>, It is <HI>a Gentleman of the Roman Church</HI>, who &s;ent us the twenty Queries, as manife&s;tly ap|pears from the Queries them&s;elves. And tho' by <HI>his Spelling one would think him no Je&s;uit</HI>, yet Father <HI>Poulton</HI> the Je&s;uit in King <HI>James</HI>'s Reign &s;pelt much after the &s;ame Rate in his Letters to Dr. <HI>Tenni&s;on</HI> the pre&s;ent Mo&s;t Reverend Arch-Bi|&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI>.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>th.</HI> Tho' the <HI>great and the noble, the pious and the Learned</HI> among us, who at pre&s;ent &s;u&s;pect <HI>P&mdash;r</HI> are not in the Intere&s;t of <HI>Rome</HI>, yet even tho&s;e may be &s;o far <HI>prejudiced by the Je&s;uits fal&s;e Reports</HI>, as to be made very capable of being led a&s;ide by Arguments of no real Weight. It has been reported <HI>P&mdash;r</HI> is in the Intere&s;t of the Je|&s;uits, or is a Je&s;uit. And after this any true Prote|&s;tant that loves the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> In&s;titution, has Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect a Man concerning whom &s;uch things are reported. It is no new thing to our Church to find Enemies in all Shapes. We find even the Character of Churchman has been &s;ometimes made u&s;e of as a Cloak to hide the mo&s;t inveterate E|nemies of the Church, and therefore well may we &s;u&s;pect any man who is reported a Je&s;uit, tho' he &s;eems never &s;o good a Churchman.</P>
<P>But then his works would di&s;cover the Cloven|&s;oot. Such Men as the&s;e always under Colour of advancing &s;ome &s;eeming good have done, or &s;hew'd De&s;igns of doing a real Mi&s;chief to our Church. But what does <HI>P&mdash;r</HI> do that manife&s;ts any &s;uch De&s;ign? He is upon all Occa&s;ions <HI>a zea|lous Defender of Epi&s;copacy, and our Liturgy</HI>; and by <HI>his con&s;tant regular Behaviour</HI> adorns his holy Profe&s;&s;ion. He receives <HI>the Holy Commu|nion</HI> with a Frequency more than u&s;ual among or|dinary
<PB N="51" REF="60">
Profe&s;&s;ors. He diligently <HI>attends tho&s;e Preachers, who&s;e Sermons have</HI> the greate&s;t Pro|bability of being mo&s;t edifying; &s;uch as have the be&s;t compo&s;ition, that <HI>of Piety and Learning</HI>. He has <HI>appeared in Print in behalf of</HI> that holy Book to which we owe our pre&s;ent Happine&s;s and future Hopes <HI>The holy Bible</HI>, which one thing alone does <HI>with us</HI> argue him <HI>no Je&s;uit</HI>, nor at all in their Intere&s;t, for they and their Abettors as much as po&s;&s;ible <HI>run down the holy Scriptures</HI>, and &s;et up &s;ome other Authorities, well fore&s;eeing all other Authority about Religion mu&s;t at la&s;t end in that of the Roman Tradition. It may be &s;aid that <HI>his being reported a Je&s;uit could not come from the Je&s;uits</HI>, but they who &s;ay this &s;hew only their own Ignorance of the Je&s;uits management, who for the mo&s;t part make the loude&s;t Noi&s;e again&s;t the Pope to render them&s;elves le&s;s &s;u&s;pected, while under the Pretence of farther Reformation they divide, and as far as they can de&s;troy us. And therefore we hope it will not be thought Irrational to &s;uppo&s;e the Je&s;uits to ruin our Convert may be the Authors of the Slander that he is a Je&s;uit.</P>
<P>Therefore that we may detain the Reader no longer, we &s;hall conclude our Enquiry with re|peating an Apology for the Plainne&s;s and want of Eloquence that we are very con&s;cious has appear'd in every Page. We are <HI>Plebeians</HI>, and the utmo&s;t of our Education has been confined to the Grammar School. If any Logick appears it is purely natural, and as for Rhetorick we have not the lea&s;t Pretence to it.</P>
<P>It is confe&s;&s;ed we wi&s;h heartily we had &s;ome De|gree of that la&s;t named Science, for then this En|quiry &s;hould have been &s;et off with a neat Conclu&s;i|on, which might have induced the World to have once more entertain'd a good Opinion of the Man

We could al&s;o have told you in proper Words, tho' not adequate, becau&s;e not &s;ufficient to expre&s;s the Indowments natural and acquired, and the Merit and real Worth of the Man, thus by God's Pro|vidence hither conducted; and the Honour that redounds to our Church by &s;uch a Conver&s;ion.

<P>And here we might have reviewed all the Ob|jections again&s;t him, and reflected upon the Suc|ce&s;s of &s;uch pitiful and mean Indeavours to ruin &s;uch a Man's Reputation, upon which not only his Quiet, but his very Life depends, and a great Addition both to the Glory of our Church, and to the Number of its Members, by the Conver&s;ion of the great and populous, the Rich, and the potent Empire of <HI>Japan</HI>, of which <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> is a very con|&s;iderable dependant, and the only door by which our Religion can enter as things now are.</P>

<HEAD>GEORGE PSALMANAAZAAR'S ANSWER TO M. <HI>d'AMALVY</HI>.</HEAD>
<P>THE Book that I am now an&s;wering, having been &s;een by &s;o few here in <HI>England</HI>, and it being hardly worth the while to copy it throughout, I thought it the be&s;t way to take a &s;hort Ab&s;tract of all the Objections made by the Author, and an|&s;wer them, leaving his Book at my Book&s;ellers for any who think it worth their while to exa|mine it. Therefore without any farther Preamble I come to</P>
<P>Pag. 1<HI>&s;t.</HI> Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> thinking it was Mr. <HI>Innes</HI> that wrote my Book in French, takes an Oppor|tunity of expo&s;ing him thus.
<Q>&startq;The Author, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> of <HI>P&s;almanaazaar</HI>'s Hi&s;tory either wanted Hone&s;ty or good Memoires, that he did therefore endeavour to conceal his Name under the Letters of <HI>S. N. F. D. B. R.</HI> for fear People &s;hould think &endq;he has &s;aid too much in his own Prai&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="67">I think Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> will not be very well plea&s;ed when I come to undeceive him. All <HI>Eng|land</HI> knows that I fir&s;t writ the Book in Latin, that afterwards it was done into Engli&s;h, then a French Gentleman turned it into French, and the afore&s;aid Letters &s;pell neither more nor le&s;s than <HI>Sieur Nicolas Francois Du Bois Refugie</HI>.</P>
<P>But however he &s;ays that <HI>this French Author</HI>, (Tran&s;lator he &s;hould call him) <HI>wanted either Hone&s;ty or good Memoirs</HI>, I &s;ay, perhaps, he want|ed neither. For <HI>fir&s;t</HI>, as to the former, &s;ome gro&s;s Blunders he has made in his Tran&s;lation, but has for the mo&s;t part faithfully followed my &s;en&s;e in every thing el&s;e. And by the way I mu&s;t acquaint the Reader that as to tho&s;e Faults which are in the French; I will by no means be accountable for them, and therefore &s;hall refer him to my own Original, to be &s;een at the Book&s;ellers, or to the Engli&s;h Tran&s;lation. But the&s;e Mi&s;takes I do not think willful. And, <HI>&s;econdly</HI>, As to his want <HI>of good Memoirs</HI>, is what I &s;hall con|&s;ult Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> in: <HI>Pag.</HI> 4. he &s;ays, that "<HI>when one thinks &s;eriou&s;ly upon what pa&s;t among&s;t the great Multitude of Pro&s;elytes he cannot for|bear &s;aying, me ve&s;tigia terrent</HI>. But any Body that had &s;een what pa&s;&s;ed in my Conver&s;ion can very well perceive that this is only <HI>a very mali|cious Reflection</HI>. For he could be informed from my Captain how I had been bani&s;h'd the Elector of <HI>Colen</HI>'s Service, becau&s;e I would not turn Pa|pi&s;t. All my Regiment could certifie him how I was there courted by <HI>Papi&s;ts, Lutherans</HI>, and <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> to turn, and even very richly offer'd, whether by way of treat, or in good earne&s;t, I know not; but however I refu&s;ed all other means to be converted, but the right one, which was arguing. In <HI>Sluice</HI> I was, as he &s;ays, for long
<PB N="61" REF="68">
time unknown by all except tho&s;e of my Regi|ment. I did not go to look after him, but he af|ter me; and I &s;hould then have been very glad if he would have let me alone as I was, tho' I now ble&s;s God he found me out.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides if he was &s;o &s;u&s;picious of me, why was <HI>he &s;o hot and de&s;irous to convert me?</HI> Why <HI>with me for not going to him when he would have me?</HI> But of this enough.</P>
<P><HI>Ibid.</HI> He employs all his Eloquence <HI>in vindica|ting the Learning of the Mini&s;ters of</HI> Boi&s;leduc: But he might as well have employed it in vindicating their Eye-&s;ight as their Learning, for as I never did call 'em blind, neither did I ever call 'em ignorant, either in Di&s;cour&s;e or Writing, to which I dare challenge all the World.</P>
<P><HI>Pag.</HI> 5. He begins <HI>the Hi&s;tory of my Conver&s;ion from the Day I was &s;ent for by Brigadier Lawder</HI>. Very well! Only he omits this Circum&s;tance, that <HI>he al&s;o was invited</HI>, and came accordingly, but having heard what he was &s;ent for, <HI>he excu&s;ed him|&s;elf, and went away again without &s;peaking a word to me</HI>. Wherefore, <HI>Mr.</HI> Innes <HI>&s;upplied his place</HI>, but the Di&s;cour&s;e ran more upon the Relation of my Country than Di&s;putes of Religion; but two Days after I was invited by Mr. <HI>Innes</HI> to his Chamber, where <HI>Mr.</HI> d'Amalvy <HI>came al&s;o, and with whom I had that Conference I &s;peak of in my Book</HI>, pag. 207<HI>th.</HI> &s;o that his not being at the Bri|gadier <HI>Lawder</HI>'s was no fault of mine.</P>
<P><HI>Pag.</HI> 6<HI>th.</HI> he nameth <HI>the &s;everal Gentlemen that were pre&s;ent at our Conference</HI>, 'tis more than I could do, and goes on very right <HI>pag.</HI> 7, 8, and 9<HI>th.</HI> and agrees very well with my Engli&s;h Book. As for the French, as I have already &s;aid, I have no|thing to do with the Mi&s;takes made by the Tran|&s;lator.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="69">Pag. 10. He informs the Reader
<Q>&startq;that after I had told him the chief Heads of my Religion he objected again&s;t them, becau&s;e they did not an|&endq;&s;wer the Notions we had premi&s;ed of a God, <HI>but he &s;ays not a word of what the&s;e were he obje|cted again&s;t</HI>.</Q>
But they were <HI>the Sacrifices of Chil|dren</HI>, and <HI>the Apparition of our God in the Shape of a Bull</HI>, &amp;c. upon which I retorted to him <HI>his ab&s;olute Prede&s;tination</HI>, and <HI>the Appearance of the Holy Gho&s;t in the Shape of a Dove</HI>, which he did not an&s;wer, neither would he let any Body el&s;e an&s;wer.</P>
<P>After this the Reader may judge whether <HI>I had any great Encouragement to go to him any more</HI>. However, as he &s;aid, <HI>Pag.</HI> 11. <HI>he did de&s;ire me to meet him at his Hou&s;e, for he was of opinion a private Conference between him and me</HI>, Mr. <HI>Innes</HI>, how|ever admitted, <HI>would be better than one where there are &s;o many</HI>. However, tho' I did not then refu&s;e the Appointment, yet when the Day was come I could not find in my Heart to keep it, for I was per&s;uaded he could not an&s;wer my Objections, and therefore <HI>was very willing to be quiet, and conti|nue as I was</HI>. However <HI>private</HI> this Company was to be, yet he complains that <HI>I did di&s;appoint a great many Gentlemen and Ladies</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>Pag.</HI> 12. He tells you "<HI>of my having been car|ried before the Con&s;i&s;tory of</HI> Sluice. Right! And when we have abated the Eloquence with which he prai&s;es him&s;elf, and the Con&s;i&s;tory, it amounts to no more than this, that they <HI>did not think fit to honour me with their Attention</HI>, which how ju&s;t and rea&s;onable Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> may call it, yet it does not appear &s;o to me, neither does he give any Rea&s;on in his Book, nor they then, why they would not hear me; &s;aving, that it was too &s;oon for me to an&s;wer for my Conver&s;ion, which by the way, they could not be judges of. Be&s;ides there
<PB N="63" REF="70">
was no Obligation either on Mr. <HI>Innes</HI>'s &s;ide or mine to appear before the &s;aid Con&s;i&s;tory, there|fore he ought not to be &s;o very angry with me for refu&s;ing to repeat the &s;ame voluntary Act. Wherefore, in the &s;tead of it Mr. <HI>Innes</HI> &s;ent to them a Letter, whereof he now in <HI>Portugal</HI> has the Copy, therefore I can &s;ay but little of the Ab&s;tract, which Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> has took out of the Acts of his Con&s;i&s;tory, in which, fir&s;t they <HI>cen&s;ure Mr.</HI> Innes <HI>for &s;aying in the &s;aid Letter, that he did not carry me to the Con&s;i&s;tory with a De&s;ign of making them Judges, but only Wit|ne&s;&s;es of my Conver&s;ion</HI>. Now I don't &s;ee where the harm of that is; for fir&s;t, <HI>the Rea&s;on why Mr.</HI> Innes <HI>did carry me to them</HI>, was becau&s;e they were di&s;&s;a|tisfied at my Conver&s;ion, and whi&s;pered about that it was too ha&s;ty to be &s;incere, therefore they &s;eem'd affraid lea&s;t Mr. <HI>Innes</HI> had u&s;ed <HI>&s;ome other Means</HI> than Arguments to convert me. Wherefore to prevent <HI>their fal&s;e Su&s;picion and Slander</HI>, I de|&s;igned <HI>they them&s;elves &s;hould &s;ee they were in the wrong</HI>.</P>
<P>And <HI>2dly, Mr.</HI> Innes <HI>would have been very im|prudent had he &s;ubmitted to their Judgement in this Ca&s;e</HI>, for they who think and call the Church of <HI>England</HI> Heterodox would never have thought me qualified for Bapti&s;m, tho' I had believed all the &s;aid Church affirms.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly</HI>, in this ab&s;tract
<Q>&startq;they complain of Mr. <HI>Innes</HI> for writing a Letter &s;o unworthy a Mi|&endq;ni&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
I have no Copy of the &s;aid Letter, therefore all I can &s;ay is, that I don't remember any <HI>thing in it that de&s;erved &s;uch Epi|thets</HI>. But why was not Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> &s;o kind as either to tran&s;cribe or tran&s;late it, and put it in his Book that the Reader might have judged of it him&s;elf.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="64" REF="71">3<HI>dly, They complain of "the Brigadier</HI> Lawder "<HI>that he would not meddle in this Affair</HI>.

But I thought the Brigadier <HI>Lawder</HI> had given them &s;ufficient Rea&s;on why he would not have a Hand in it, in &s;aying <HI>that he was a Sol|dier, and not a Bi&s;hop, and therefore &s;uch things were out of his Power, and out of his way</HI>.</P>

Thirdly, <HI>That the Ceremony was performed, without any Nece&s;&s;ity in an unknown Languague</HI>, viz. <HI>in Latin, which was under&s;tood but by &s;ome of 'em that were pre&s;ent</HI>, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And 1<HI>&s;t, As to the time</HI> I do think it indiffe|rent, neither do I know of any Articles, or any Canons of the Church of <HI>England</HI> that appoints any certain time for it.</P>

<Q>&startq;P&s;almanaazaar &s;ays that I went the next Morning to beg a Conference with him, which is fal&s;e, for it was Mr. <HI>Innes</HI> that did &endq;it.</Q>
Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> is in the right, but it is not me but the <HI>French</HI> Tran&s;lator, who is in the wrong, and had he well looked to the Original, he would not have committed that Error contrary to my A&s;|&s;ertion, <HI>p.</HI> 207.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="74"><HI>Pag.</HI> 24. He complains, and that very ju&s;tly too, of an A&s;&s;ertion in the <HI>French</HI>, which &s;ays thus,
<Q>&startq;that at our fir&s;t meeting Mr. d'Amalvy promi|&s;ed me that he would turn of my Religion, if he &endq;could not make a Chri&s;tian of me,</Q>
but this is a horri|ble blunder of the <HI>French</HI> Tran&s;lator, for my <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> runs thus,
<Q>&startq;He made me this Promi&s;e before them all, that if I could &s;hew more Evidence for the Truth of my Religion than he could for the Truth of his, he would gladly renounce his, and embrace &endq;mine; <HI>which A&s;&s;ertion Mr.</HI> d'Amalvy <HI>owns to have &s;aid</HI> vide <HI>his Book,</HI> p. <HI>7</HI>th.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Pag.</HI> 26. He is very &s;harp upon me for calling Mr. <HI>Innes</HI>'s little pitiful Chamber, as he calls it, <HI>a publick a&s;&s;embly</HI>, and for calling the Number of Six <HI>a great Number of Per&s;ons</HI>.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> in the &s;tead of criticizing upon Words and Expre&s;&s;ions, would mind &s;ome more momentous Bu&s;ine&s;s, then there would be le&s;s Time and Paper wa&s;ted, but then he &s;hould have lo&s;t this favourable Opportunity of telling the World that Mr. <HI>Innes</HI> had <HI>a little pittiful Cham|ber</HI>.

<P>And as for my Calling tho&s;e that were pre&s;ent <HI>a multitude of Per&s;ons</HI>, tho' it does not run well in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>French</HI>, yet in <HI>Latin</HI> it might pa&s;s. For <HI>multitudo hominum</HI>, and <HI>multi homines</HI>, do not

<P><HI>Ibid.</HI> He denies that I made any &s;uch Retortion to him as I have affirmed, and is angry at the Ex|pre&s;&s;ions, which are indeed of the <HI>French</HI> Tran|&s;lator's own putting, for he words it thus, <HI>at which the Mini&s;ter was &s;urprized, puzled and confounded</HI>, whereas my <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ays that <HI>to the&s;e Retortions he could not an&s;wer</HI>, which appears by his not an&s;wering.

<P>But as for his pre&s;ent <HI>Denial</HI>, I think he does take but an indifferent Method of arguing.

<Q>&startq;<HI>P&s;almanaazaar</HI> is in the wrong for calling the Doctrine of Prede&s;ti|nation, and Reprobation frightful Doctrines, and &endq;contrary to all Laws of Religion.</Q>
If I was the fir&s;t that ever &s;ay'd &s;o, I &s;hould think my &s;elf oblig'd to &s;ay &s;omewhat for my &s;elf, but &s;ince I have &s;uch great Number of learned Men, who not only called it &s;o, but proved it &s;uch before me, therefore my be&s;t way, I think, is to &s;tand be|hind them, and hold my Tongue.</P>

But I would be glad to &s;ee Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> &s;hew a little of that Charity to|wards the Churches of <HI>England</HI>, which upon a Fault of mine he did but now banter with his Alle|gory of Spectacles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Neither do I remember that ever I perceived the lea&s;t <HI>Glimp&s;e of it in him towards Mr.</HI> Innes, for he was &s;o far from that, that he would <HI>oppo&s;e</HI> him in every thing; call him <HI>a Heretick</HI>, and publickly condemn him as <HI>a &s;candalous Man, an unworthy Mini&s;ter</HI> for pow|dering of his Hair, and playing upon Mu&s;ical In|&s;truments, and &s;uch like innocent things; and which is more, did <HI>pro&s;ecute him</HI> before the States, for having baptized a Child of one of his own Re|giment, and of the Church of <HI>England</HI>.

<P><Q>&startq;I will believe, <HI>&s;aith he,</HI> p. <HI>38.</HI> That this Do|ctrine of Prede&s;tination is contrary to the Rea|&s;on of Mr. <HI>P&s;almanaazaar,</HI> but the Que&s;tion is, whether his Rea&s;on be deci&s;ive in this Particu|&endq;lar.</Q>

<P>I mu&s;t refer Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> to <HI>Limburgh</HI>'s <HI>Theolo|gia Chri&s;tiana</HI>, in which he proves clearly all the Pa&s;|&s;ages of the Scriptures, made u&s;e of by <HI>the Pre|de&s;tinarians</HI> to prove that Doctrine, are &s;crewed out of their proper Sen&s;e, and contrary to the De|&s;ign of the Holy Gho&s;t; which Book Mr. <HI>Innes</HI> recommended to me that I might be a&s;&s;ured that <HI>there is nothing in the Bible that does prove that Doctrine</HI>. And the Article of the Church of <HI>Eng|land</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Nothing can be receiv'd as of Faith, but what can be proved there</HI>.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly, God's Power over his Creatures</HI>, in my Opinion, does not prove that he can exert the &s;ame in making &s;ome of 'em mi&s;erable without their having de&s;erved it by their Deeds.</P>
<P>But 3<HI>dly, Mr.</HI> d'Amalvy <HI>has forgot my Retorti|on</HI>, for <HI>the more he vindicates the Doctrines of Re|probation the more he ju&s;tifies the Sacrifices of Chil|dren</HI>; for if a ju&s;t and merciful God can without Breach of the&s;e Attributes condemn &s;o many Men to eternal Mi&s;eries, without regard to their Acti|ons, much more can he require the Death of a Number of Children, when they are &s;ure to gain an eternal Life by it. So that Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> has &s;aid nothing to my Argument.</P>
<P><HI>Pag.</HI> 41. He endeavours to in&s;inuate me no true Convert, becau&s;e I do not hold Prede&s;tination.
<Q>&startq;P&mdash;r, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> declareth War with the Church of <HI>England</HI> it &s;elf, who has in one of the &endq;<HI>39</HI> Articles declared for that Doctrine.</Q>
And then he repeats that Article. But had he attended to that and the re&s;t he would have found the Church
<PB N="72" REF="79">
of <HI>England</HI> doth not hold Prede&s;tination. And the very Article he quotes could have &s;hew'd him, that &s;he never propo&s;ed to be thought a Favourer of &s;uch Doctrine. For,</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t</HI>, In Article 2 and 31, are the&s;e words, <HI>the Offering of Chri&s;t, is that perfect Redemption, Pro|pitiation and Satisfaction for all the Sins of the whole World, both original and actual</HI>. And in the 16<HI>th</HI> even in the very next before that of Prede&s;ti|nation we find this A&s;&s;ertion, <HI>that after</HI> we have received the Holy Gho&s;t, we may <HI>depart from Grace given, and fall into Sin</HI>. Now what can Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> &s;ay to this, if Chri&s;t <HI>died for all the World</HI>, then not <HI>for the Elect only</HI>; if they, <HI>who have received the holy Gho&s;t</HI> may fall away, then no one can <HI>be ab&s;olutely prede&s;tinated</HI>, unle&s;s, to receive the Holy Gho&s;t, in the 16<HI>th</HI> Article be dif|ferent from the &s;ame, in the 17 Article. Some other Spectacles than any Chri&s;tian, not to &s;ay <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>|man u&s;es, mu&s;t be found out to di&s;cover how the&s;e Articles can be &s;aid <HI>to affirm Prede&s;tination</HI>.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly</HI>, And in the very Article quoted by Mr. <HI>d'A|malvy</HI>, it is plain, <HI>that the Church of</HI> England <HI>ne|ver intended to be thought a Favourer of that Do|ctrine</HI>. She has indeed <HI>defined</HI> the Word, but not <HI>affirmed</HI> the thing; &s;o far from that is &s;he, that &s;he cautions the Generality of Men again&s;t &s;o much as thinking at all of it. Let Mr. <HI>d' A|malvy</HI> read her Words,
<Q>&startq;for curious and carnal Per&s;ons lacking the Spirit of God to have conti|nually before their Eyes the Sentence of God's Prede&s;tination, is a mo&s;t dangerous Downfal, whereby the Devil doth thru&s;t them into de&s;pera|&endq;tion, <HI>or</HI> wretchle&s;ne&s;s of mo&s;t unclean Living.</Q>
Let him &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider whether <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Hy|pocri&s;ie, Envy</HI> and <HI>Malice</HI>, be not the &s;piritual
<PB N="73" REF="80">
Impurities, and Uncleanne&s;s here meant. Let him if he can a&s;&s;ign any other Cau&s;e, why a Gentleman, his own Name-&s;ake, was thru&s;t into this <HI>mo&s;t dan|gerous downfal</HI>, other than <HI>his having continually before his Eyes the Sentence of God's Prede&s;tina|tion</HI>. What el&s;e could move Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> to be &s;o angry at my not being baptized by him, and owning my Conver&s;ion to the Chri&s;tian Religion to be by his Arguments; unle&s;s becau&s;e he thinks him&s;elf <HI>a cho&s;en Ve&s;&s;el elected to do every thing he thinks honourable and great</HI>; and is not this <HI>Pride?</HI> And does he not in this prefer his own Honour to that of our common Lord and Saviour? He had rather, as is now plain, that I had never been bap|tized, than him&s;elf thus affronted thereby, and yet at the &s;ame time he pretends a mighty Zeal for the Faith. Do I mi&s;cal this, when I &s;ay 'tis <HI>Hy|pocri&s;ie</HI>; and if his Practices, then and &s;ince are not In&s;tances of Malice and Envy, and if that and tho&s;e do not proceed from the &s;ame bitter Root, that proud Opinion of his being elected, let the Rea|der judge, or rather let Mr. <HI>d'Amalvy</HI> him&s;elf think upon it, as for me I am little di&s;turbed at his Proceeding, but rather pray God to forgive him.</P>
<P>And that the Reader may &s;ee I had Rea&s;on to &s;tand off from the Church of <HI>Geneva</HI>, I have here incerted that part of their Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, in which the Doctrine of Prede&s;tination is a&s;&s;er|ted, which take as follows.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;We believe that from the general Corruption and Condemnation, in which all Men are plunged, God does draw tho&s;e, whom by his eternal and unchangeable purpo&s;e he has elected by his alone Goodne&s;s and Mercy in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, without any Con&s;ideration of their Work, <HI>leaving

the Re&s;t in the &s;ame Corruption and Condem|nation to manife&s;t his Ju&s;tice in them, as upon the fir&s;t he makes to &s;hine the Richne&s;s of his Mercy</HI>. For you are not better than the other, <HI>until God has made the Difference</HI> according to his immutable Purpo&s;e, which he has determined in Je&s;us Chri&s;t before the Foundation of the World. And al&s;o no one is able to put him&s;elf into &s;o great a Good <HI>by his own proper Vertue,</HI> for as much as of our Nature we cannot have any good Motion, nor Will, nor Thought, unle&s;s God has &endq;di&s;po&s;ed us thereto.</Q>
Art. 12th.</P>
<P>And I do here again declare, that had the Church of <HI>England</HI> maintained the &s;ame I could never have joined with it.</P>
<P>Pag. 44. <HI>He al&s;o denies the Retortion I made to him of the Apparition of the Holy Gho&s;t</HI>, tho' with as little Rea&s;on as he denies that of ab&s;olute Pre|de&s;tination, and I appeal to the&s;e Gentlemen that were pre&s;ent, let them declare who is right.
<Q>&startq;But, <HI>quoth he,</HI> granting he had made the &s;aid Retortion, why? is it &s;o bad with me, that am a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, that I could not have an&s;wered it when any of our Students would be able to do it.

<P>Now let any Soul alive judge whether this is an&s;wering my Argument, for I never told him that <HI>either that Bull, Lion</HI>, &amp;c. were <HI>Gods to whom we ought to pay any Homage</HI>, but rather, that they
<PB N="75" REF="82">
were only <HI>Signs of the more immediate Pre&s;ence of our God</HI>, and of his being either <HI>angry or well plea&s;ed with his People</HI>. I pa&s;s by his accu&s;tomed Language, when his Argument is wrong.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Mr. <HI>P&s;almanaazaar, &s;ays he,</HI> Pag. <HI>41.</HI> Will make me pa&s;s for a mightier Man than I am, when he &s;ays that my bare &s;aying hold your Tongue, could &s;ilence the whole Company in a Cau&s;e, where|in the Truth of the Go&s;pel was to run &s;uch great &endq;hazard, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>

<P><HI>Why</HI>, &s;ays he, <HI>pag.</HI> 49 <HI>and</HI> 50, <HI>Ought any Body</HI>

But, Sir, you have neither an&s;wered my Argument, nor own'd your &s;elf embarra&s;&s;ed. I &s;hall pa&s;s by all the fal&s;e Reflections he maketh from what he has &s;aid here, and the divers Slan|ders he throws both at Mr. <HI>Innes</HI> and me. He's too wi&s;e, and too innocent to mind them, and as for me, whether I do de&s;erve this Language or not, let the Reader judge. However, to his prai&s;e be it, that gives it, for he gives it very very heartily, but God grant him better Marks of his being prede&s;tinate.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="83"><HI>Pag.</HI> 52. He comes again upon me, becau&s;e I &s;ay in my Book, that

To which among other things, not worth being here incerted, he &s;ays,
<Q>&startq;That I mu&s;t be very penetrating to have di&s;covered any Pride in him at one &s;ingle meeting: But, however, that I ought to have &s;hewed more of a true Pro&s;elyte in me, and not have gone and ex|po&s;ed a Mini&s;ter, whom one cannot expo&s;e with|out expo&s;ing his Mini&s;try, and con&s;equently the &endq;Truth of the Go&s;pel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But fir&s;t, I think, I needed not to be &s;o &s;harp-&s;ighted to have di&s;covered him &s;uch as I repre|&s;ent him, and if I had been then mi&s;taken, he &s;hould have done &s;omething &s;ince to have con|vinced me of it.

<P>I own I have tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed upon that Charity, which all Chri&s;tians ought to have; and that in more In&s;tances than this, but then I beg of him not to make my Fault greater than it is, in &s;aying that I re|flected con&s;equently upon the Mini&s;try and Go&s;pel it &s;elf, for I don't think it does follow: Faults be|ing per&s;onal. And if the bad Lives of Chri&s;tians and Mini&s;ters was any Argument again&s;t the Chri|&s;tian Religion, I am afraid that it ould be far from being the be&s;t in the World, and the onely true one. But I don't think any Body &s;o &s;imple, even of his Congregation that would think wor&s;e of the Go|&s;pel, becau&s;e the Mini&s;ter does not live according to it.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;However, <HI>&s;aith he,</HI> p. <HI>54.</HI> I do promi&s;e the Author and Mr. <HI>P&s;almanaazaar</HI> I will make a good u&s;e of his Reproach, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For was it a &s;econd

<P>This is all I have found that &s;eemed to carry any Argument with it, as for the re&s;t of the Book, <HI>i. e.</HI> from pag. 59 to 64, which is the la&s;t Page, there is nothing but a Mixture of <HI>S&mdash; M&mdash; S&mdash; P</HI>&mdash;, and what&s;oever the Reader &s;hall be plea&s;ed to call it.</P>
<P>But I will not conclude without telling him that all he has done &s;hall never hinder me from being in perfect Charity with him. Neither &s;hould I have an&s;wered his Book, had he not in it ca&s;t &s;ome Reflections on the Church of <HI>Eng|land</HI> which could by no means admit of any Si|lence in me; for were it &s;uch as he has repre&s;en|ted
