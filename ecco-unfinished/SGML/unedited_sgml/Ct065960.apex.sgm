<HEAD>SOME CONSIDERATIONS ON A LAW FOR Triennial Parliaments.</HEAD>
<P>LAW is the mo&s;t valuable Pri|vilege of the People: 'Tis the Limit of the Soveraign Au|thority, and the Rule of the Peoples Obedience: 'Tis not only their Security from the Tyranny of their Princes, but 'tis the Pledge of their mutual Peace; it pre&s;erves Order, &s;up|ports all Kinds of Subordination, che|ri&s;hes Vertue, prompts and encourages Arts, Indu&s;try, Learning, and all the nece&s;&s;ary Parts of humane Improve|ment: 'Tis the Guard of Honour, the Sanctuary of Innocence, and the la&s;t Refuge of every hone&s;t Man.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
As this is to be &s;aid of the Law in every well Government; &s;o there is &s;omething to be added with re&s;pect to the People of the&s;e Nations, that is not to be &s;aid of mo&s;t, if it is of any Nation in the World, <HI>Great-Britain</HI> excepted, <HI>viz.</HI> That no Laws can be made, or when made, can be &s;u&s;pended and repealed, but by the Con&s;ent of the People.</P>
<P>This Solemn Word Law, is expre&s;s'd in different Terms, and bears a diffe|rent Signification, according to the Na|ture of the Thing it has re&s;pect to. But that I may not enter into a long Debate about the Branch of the Law I am now to &s;peak of, I lay it down thus beforehand, <HI>viz.</HI> That I am &s;peak|ing now of Laws re&s;pecting Civil Po|licy, and the Government of a Nation. The&s;e with us are call'd the Con&s;titu|tion, and contain the Prerogatives of the Crown, and the Peoples Liberties.</P>
<P>As it is ju&s;t we &s;hould, &s;o in this Nation we are the mo&s;t chary of the&s;e of any Nation in the World; and we have carry'd Things very high, even to War and Death, Revolution of Govern|ment, and Dethroning our Kings, when the Laws, by which they ought to go|vern,
<PB N="5" REF="4">
have been invaded, or the Execu|tion of them di&s;pens'd with by the Le|gal Authority.</P>
<P>By the &s;ame Rule, we ought to be very chary on our own Side: And tho' the Right to &s;u&s;pend the Laws of every Kind is undoubtedly lodg'd in the Peo|ple, that is to &s;ay, in Parliament; and they may, upon extraordinary Occa|&s;ions, con&s;ent to it; yet it is but upon very great and extraordinary Occa&s;ions, and oftentimes not without Difficulty, that the People are brought to con&s;ent to it, and always with lawful Re&s;tri|ctions, and for as little Time as po&s;&s;i|ble.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Things I thought it was nece&s;&s;ary to lay down, as an Introdu|ction to the following Di&s;cour&s;e; be|cau&s;e I am next to advance a Maxim in our Con&s;titution, <HI>viz.</HI> That there is not only a Right lodg'd in the Con&s;ti|tution, for the &s;u&s;pending the Execution of the Laws; but that there may be a Time when it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to do &s;o; and this mu&s;t be under&s;tood even of tho&s;e Laws which are the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to the Peoples Liberties, and the mo&s;t fundamental Part of their Pri|vileges,
<PB N="6" REF="5">
as well as of others le&s;s &s;igni|ficant.</P>
<P>To prove there may be &s;uch a Cir|cum&s;tance or Nece&s;&s;ity, it is to the Purpo&s;e, fir&s;t, to &s;hew, that there have been &s;uch in Time pa&s;t; and, &s;econd|ly, that there is &s;uch a one depending at this very Time.</P>
<P><HI>We need not run back into Anti|quity for Examples: The Militia Bill is the fir&s;t I &s;hall bring upon the Stage; it is a very &s;ignificant Article in the Law, made 13.</HI> Car. <HI>II. for &s;ettling the Militia,</HI> That to prevent the harra&s;&s;ing the Country, and putting them to Extra|ordinary Charges for arming and march|ing the Train'd-Bands, or County Troops, on Pretence of defending the Country, as often as a timorous or a vexatious Prince may think fit, that Provi&s;ion is made, that after the Militia has been once rai&s;ed, and a Month's Pay advanc'd to them by the Country, as that Law di|rects, the &s;aid Country &s;hall not be oblig'd to rai&s;e the Militia again, let the Occa|&s;ion be what it will, until the Month's Pay, formerly advanc'd, be repaid them by the Crown.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be acknowledg'd, that this is a mo&s;t valuable Privilege of the Peo|ple
<PB N="7" REF="6">
of this Nation, and &s;ecures them again&s;t an infinite Number of Encroach|ments and Oppre&s;&s;ions, which they might otherwi&s;e be &s;ubject to: Nay, it prevents the De&s;truction of all their o|ther Liberties, which their King's hav|ing the ab&s;olute Di&s;po&s;al of the Militia might bring upon them, making the People cut the Throat of the Con&s;titu|tion with their own Hands, making the very Militia a Standing-Army in Time of Peace, and at the Country's Expence al&s;o, by putting in &s;uch Under-Officers as they plea&s;e, and commanding them by &s;uch Lord Lieutenants as the King &s;hould find for his Purpo&s;e, and as are never wanting, let the Purpo&s;e be ne|ver &s;o wicked; an eminent In&s;tance of which is fre&s;h in the Memory of many yet living, when the Train'd-Bands of the City of <HI>London,</HI> in the Time of Sir <HI>John Moor</HI>'s being Lord Mayor, were made the Tools to offer Violence to the Privileges of the City, and to Garri&s;on the <HI>Guild-Hall,</HI> to keep the Livery-men, &s;uch only as they plea&s;ed to admit, from the Freedom of their Votes.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things &s;hew the Value of this Law, for &s;ettling the Militia, and
<PB N="8" REF="7">
how e&s;&s;ential it is to the Liberties of the People of <HI>England;</HI> and yet we find this Law &s;u&s;pended in its Execution from Year to Year, for almo&s;t the la&s;t 20 Years, by Acts of Parliament brought in every Se&s;&s;ion, Entituled thus; <HI>An Act for rai&s;ing the Militia for the Year .... notwith&s;tanding the Month's Pay formerly advanc'd be not repaid,</HI> &amp;c. The Rea|&s;ons and Nece&s;&s;ity of thus &s;u&s;pending the Execution of the former Law are &s;o evident, that I need &s;ay nothing, but refer the Reader to the long Con|tinuance of an expen&s;ive War, which made the Repayment of the &s;aid Month's Pay a Burthen, and the Dan|ger of Inva&s;ions from a powerful Ene|my very imminent.</P>
<P><HI>The Habeas Corpus Act</HI> is another In&s;tance. The Value of this Law to the People of <HI>England,</HI> the Bulwark that it is to their Liberties, the Sen&s;e the People have always had of the U&s;eful|ne&s;s of it. The&s;e all &s;peak for them|&s;elves; yet upon extraordinary Occa|&s;ions, and that long before this la&s;t un|happy Occa&s;ion now &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, this Law has frequently been &s;u&s;pended for a Time, by the Con&s;ent, nay, at the very Motion and De&s;ire of the People
<PB N="9" REF="8">
them&s;elves, for who&s;e Security, and for the Defence of who&s;e Liberties that Law was made, the &s;everal Precedents are needle&s;s to repeat; but one is very &s;ingular, <HI>viz.</HI> the Impri&s;oning Captain <HI>Counter,</HI> and the five other Gentlemen, commonly known by the Name of the <HI>A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inators,</HI> in <HI>Newgate,</HI> without Bail, and without Tryal, which has now been continued for near 20 Year, &s;ometimes for a certain Time, &s;ometimes without a Limitation, a thing without Example, during the Soveraign's Plea&s;ure. This, I &s;ay, is an eminent In&s;tance of the &s;u&s;|pending that Law; a Law, which, as it was ever e&s;teem'd one of the ine&s;tima|ble Branches of our Liberties, &s;o it is a Law, which of all other Laws &s;eems to be the mo&s;t dangerous to give up into the Hands of the Soveraign; the lea&s;t Mi&s;u&s;e of which Power opens a Door to the wor&s;t kind of Oppre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Penal Laws are another Example of the Practice of &s;u&s;pending the Exe|cution of Law by Parliament, the <HI>Di&s;|&s;enters</HI> being di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the Act of Exemption, commonly call'd the <HI>Tolera|tion Act,</HI> from the Penalty of tho&s;e Laws, which yet are in them&s;elves thought to be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to
<PB N="10" REF="9">
the Safety and Pre&s;ervation of the Pro|te&s;tant Religion.</P>
<P>The late Occa&s;ion of &s;u&s;pending the <HI>Habeas Corpus Bill,</HI> in order to em|power the King to &s;ecure the Per&s;ons of Traytors, practi&s;ing to rai&s;e a Rebellion in this Nation, is an Example too noto|rious to need any mention, or to be ca|pable of any An&s;wer. All the&s;e Things make good what was at fir&s;t laid down, <HI>viz.</HI> That there has been a Time, when the Wi&s;dom of the Parliament have thought it nece&s;&s;ary, for the Good of the People them&s;elves, to &s;u&s;pend, for &s;ome time, the Force, and di&s;pen&s;e with the Execution, even of tho&s;e Laws, which have been thought the mo&s;t E&s;&s;ential to the pre&s;erving the Peoples Liberties.</P>
<P>It remains, that I de&s;cend to the Ca&s;e now in hand, and to enquire, whether a Bill, for the Triennial Calling of Par|liaments in <HI>England,</HI> may not be &s;ubject to the &s;ame Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Not whether the Parliament have the &s;ame Power to &s;u&s;pend it, for that is out of the Que&s;tion; but whether there may not be a Time, in which &s;uch a Law may not be found inconvenient and dan|gerous, and con&s;equently that it ought to be con&s;ider'd of, whether the Execu|tion
<PB N="11" REF="10">
of, or &s;trict adhering to it, may not be thought nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;u&s;pended for a Sea&s;on, and whether it is pro|per at this very Time or no.</P>
<P>It is true, &s;uch an Enquiry at this Time may be thought very pre&s;um|ptuous in a private Per&s;on, and many will cen&s;ure the Attempt, as done in Fa|vour of a Party; but the &s;ame Argu|ments that prove the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Thing, will certainly defend the Author from Cen&s;ure, and his Zeal for the Pub|lick Good will at lea&s;t plead for him, if he is &s;uppo&s;ed to go beyond the Mo|de&s;ty of a Subject. However, I &s;hall endeavour to perform this critical Task with &s;o much Circum&s;pection, as to give no Handle to Enemies, and no Offence to Friends; and let tho&s;e who di&s;like it, from their Di&s;affection to the Govern|ment, fir&s;t an&s;wer it, and then I give them free Leave to accu&s;e me to whom they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Before I proceed, I &s;hall grant what I pre&s;ume any Objector would much dwell upon, <HI>viz.</HI> the U&s;efulne&s;s, Ad|vantage, and Value of the Law for Triennial Parliaments, and let them &s;pend as many Compliments and Pane|gyricks as they plea&s;e upon the Law it|&s;elf,
<PB N="12" REF="11">
the Zeal of tho&s;e worthy Patriots that pu&s;h'd it at fir&s;t into a Law, if we may call it pu&s;hing, for it was &s;tre|nuou&s;ly oppos'd, and once refu&s;ed by King <HI>William</HI> and his be&s;t Friends; let them repeat all the Rea&s;ons given for pre&s;&s;ing it at that Time, and the Rea|&s;ons given in general why &s;uch a Law was always nece&s;&s;ary to the People; let them enlarge upon the great Topick of Debauching Members by Places and private Engagements, &amp;c. All which, together with the Hi&s;tory of the Pen|&s;ion Parliament in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. were largely in&s;i&s;ted upon, and large Speeches made upon that Sub|ject by &s;ome Members, who were called the Country Party at the Time this Bill was depending in the Hou&s;e: I &s;ay, let the&s;e, and all further that can be &s;aid in behalf of this Law, be brought out, and I &s;hall readily grant and a&s;&s;ent to it all, and that Impeachment of the pre&s;ent Argument, which indeed is not at all affected with tho&s;e Things, and amounts to no more than this, <HI>viz.</HI> That there may be a Time when, and the Publick Affairs may be &s;o circum&s;tanc'd, as that it may be nece&s;&s;ary, even for the Good of the People them&s;elves, to &s;u&s;pend the
<PB N="13" REF="12">
Execution of &s;uch a Law as this for a Sea&s;on, and with &s;uch Re&s;triction of Clau&s;es, and for &s;o long Time, as to the Wi&s;dom of Parliament &s;hall &s;eem meet.</P>
<P>This, and the Enquiry whether this is not the Time when &s;uch a Su&s;pen&s;ion is nece&s;&s;ary, I &s;hall &s;peak of together, to avoid, as much as po&s;&s;ible, multiply|ing Heads of Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>It has formerly been &s;aid of this Law, for the Triennial Meeting of Parliaments, by a very great State&s;man, that tho' it was an excellent Law, and had &s;o many other good Things nece&s;&s;arily attending it, as made it well worth our while to bear with &s;ome Inconveniencies in the Practice of it: Yet, that there was one thing which would be &s;o much the na|tural Con&s;equence of it, and was in it|&s;elf &s;o mi&s;chievous to the Publick, that it would one time or other oblige the Parliament to think of Repealing it; <HI>and this was,</HI> That it was the only Thing that would render perpetual the Divi|&s;ions among the People, and make Fa|ction eternal. I'll explain immediately what they meant by this Saying: I &s;hall only add, that if this Time the &s;ame Law is in Danger of being a Means to make Rebellion &s;o, the Argument will
<PB N="14" REF="13">
be &s;till &s;trong for what I have to &s;ay about it.</P>
<P>It has been found too true, that the Triennial Elections of Parliament have been a con&s;tant Means of keeping up the Factions and Divi&s;ions of Parties in the Counties and Corporations through the whole Kingdom; nor was it le&s;s &s;o by tho&s;e who lo&s;t, than by tho&s;e who gain'd in their Elections, which has been thus expre&s;s'd formerly: <Q>&startq;&endq;He that had lo&s;t his Election in a Country Town, made it his Bu&s;ine&s;s to form and increa&s;e his Intere&s;t, and make new Friends; employing Agents all the while for that Purpo&s;e, knowing that in 3 Years he &s;hould have a new Tryal of Skill for it. He that gain'd an Election, had nothing to do but to cultivate his Intere&s;t, keep up his Friends, pre&s;erve the good Opinion the People had of him, and &s;ecure them to be firm in their Votes, knowing very well that he mu&s;t have all the Work to do over again in 3 Year more, and that the other Candidate would &s;lip no Opportunity, nor &s;pare any Expence, to get away his Friends, and weaken his Intere&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14">
Thus, &s;ays that Author, the Factions were kept alive in the Country, and Party Feuds are handed down to Po&s;te|rity, from Age to Age, <HI>in Aeternum.</HI></P>
<P>The Government has been very &s;en|&s;ible of this; nor has it been po&s;&s;ible to alter it, without lo&s;ing that Bill, which was always of &s;o much Con&s;equence to the Kingdom, that it was better to bear the Inconvenience of the other, than to &s;trike at the Root of &s;o e&s;&s;ential a Pil|lar of the Peoples Liberty. Indeed it may be &s;aid, that every Reign has not been equally willing to have tho&s;e Di|vi&s;ions cur'd, and therefore not equally anxious about the Method, tho' it is certain the Hou&s;e of Commons have been frequently &s;en&s;ible of the ill Con|&s;equence; and therefore, tho' they would not touch this Bill on tho&s;e Occa&s;ions, partly becau&s;e not a &s;u&s;pending the Ex|ecution only, but a total Repeal of the Act it&s;elf, would have been requir'd to have an&s;wer'd the End in that Ca&s;e; yet they often made Attempts to pre|vent the Mi&s;chiefs of tho&s;e Divi&s;ions, by making Laws to prevent Bribery and Corruption in Elections of the Mem|bers. Whether tho&s;e Things have been
<PB N="16" REF="15">
effectual or not, in this Ca&s;e, is not to our Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>We are now come to a new and very &s;ingular Ca&s;e, in which, perhaps, this Act of Parliament is like to be more concern'd than ever before, and in which we are to enquire, whether there may not be &s;ome Nece&s;&s;ity to break in upon &s;ome of our own Privileges for a Sea&s;on, to prevent the Enemy's break|ing in upon the whole Con&s;titution, for want of the prudential Stop I am &s;peak|ing of.</P>
<P>To enquire into the Ca&s;e, I mu&s;t give a brief Ab&s;tract of <HI>the State of the Nation</HI> thus. We are at this Time in the Infancy of a &s;econd happy Revolu|tion: A Family is placed upon the Throne, hated for their Zeal to the Pro|te&s;tant Intere&s;t; their effectual and powerful Capacity to &s;uppre&s;s <HI>Jacobi|ti&s;m,</HI> and their exten&s;ive Intere&s;t in the other Prote&s;tant Powers of <HI>Europe,</HI> to engage them again&s;t the Friends of the <HI>Pretender:</HI> A Prince fills the Throne, always formidable to <HI>France,</HI> by his own Merit, and now dreadful to all the <HI>Po|pi&s;h</HI> Powers of <HI>Europe,</HI> by the Addition of the&s;e rich and powerful Domini|ons.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16">
His Maje&s;ty has entred upon the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, in a quiet, peaceable, and a legal Manner; and the Parliament in Being have appear'd &s;o &s;incerely, and dutifully attach'd to his Intere&s;t, that they have hitherto encouraged all the faithful Part of his Maje&s;ty's People to do their Duty, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing and defeating, or otherwi&s;e di&s;appointing, all the De|&s;igns of the Enemies to his Succe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But be it by what &s;ecret Arts and Ma|chinations it will; whether of Hell, or of the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party, or of both in Con|federacy, it is not to the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e to enquire. The Endeavours of a wicked Sett of Men among us, who yet call them&s;elves Prote&s;tants, and many of whom have taken the Oaths, as well of Allegiance, as that mo&s;t &s;olemn of all Oaths, the Abjuration of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> have, with too much Succe&s;s, pur&s;ued a Helli&s;h De&s;ign of &s;preading the Poi&s;on of Di&s;affection among the common Peo|ple of this Nation; who being abu&s;ed and impo&s;ed upon by innumerable Fal&s;$|ties, Sugge&s;tions, and Mi&s;repre&s;entations, as well of the Per&s;on of his Maje&s;ty, as of his real De&s;igns, which it is evident have been all calculated for the Publick Peace and Pro&s;perity of the&s;e Kingdoms,
<PB N="18" REF="17">
in&s;inuating the Danger, as well of our Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Con&s;titution, as of our Li|berties.</P>
<P>By the&s;e Arts mi&s;leading the poor ignorant People, they have pu&s;h'd them upon all Manner of Di&s;orders, Tumults, Violences; and even at la&s;t into an open and actual Rebellion, having taken up Arms again&s;t the Prote&s;tant Settlement, by which all our Liberties, as well Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical as Civil, are e&s;tabli&s;hed; and again&s;t our Prote&s;tant King, by whom tho&s;e Prote&s;tant E&s;tabli&s;hments are pro|tected, and have run the poor deluded People headlong into tho&s;e Contradi|ctions, which common Sen&s;e, had it been li&s;ten'd to, would have been their Protection from; &s;uch as taking up Arms for a Popi&s;h <HI>Pretender,</HI> in order to &s;ecure a Prote&s;tant Con&s;titution, and bringing in a <HI>French</HI> Tyranny for the Protection of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Liber|ties.</P>
<P>This Rebellion is &s;till in Being; and tho', by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, and the Conduct and Vigilance of the Govern|ment, they have been every where de|feated, beaten, and di&s;pers'd, and the ob&s;tinate Remains of them having their Hopes in the Refuge of inacce&s;&s;ible
<PB N="19" REF="18">
Mountains, keep together in Arms, ra|ther becau&s;e they have no rea&s;on to ex|pect Mercy and Pardon from a Prince, in &s;o gro&s;s a Manner offended, than from any Expectation of Succe&s;s; and &s;eve|ral of the Ring-leaders have been, or will be, brought to open Ju&s;tice; yet the Spirit of Rebellion &s;till remains in its full Vigour and Fury, rather animated and exa&s;perated by its Lo&s;&s;es, than &s;up|pre&s;s'd, and reduc'd to Temper, and a dutiful Subjection.</P>
<P>This Spirit of Rebellion, <HI>as is &s;aid,</HI> is &s;till in Being, and far from being &s;up|pre&s;s'd by the &s;uperior Power of the Go|vernment, is rather increa&s;ed than a|bated, &s;ince the Defeat of the Forces the Rebels had brought together; and if we enquire into the many Schemes which the Agents of the Rebellious Party have form'd to them&s;elves, and from which they promi&s;e them&s;elves great Advantages, we &s;hall find that the Termination of the pre&s;ent Parliament, at the End of 3 Years from the Te&s;t of the late Writs of Election, and which by that Rule mu&s;t happen after the next Se&s;&s;ion, or Sitting, is their pre&s;ent De|pendance, and the Thing from which they promi&s;e them&s;elves Succe&s;s in their
<PB N="20" REF="19">
De&s;igns; pre&s;uming, that by rea&s;on of the Spirit of Delu&s;ion and Di&s;affection afore&s;aid, the en&s;uing Elections might have been bya&s;s'd in Favour of their Party; and that the Members of the next Parliament &s;hould have been le&s;s zealous, and le&s;s hearty in the Service of their Country, and the Intere&s;t of our Prote&s;tant King, than the&s;e now &s;itting. In a word, it is evident, that the only Hopes of the di&s;affected Party at Home re&s;ts in keeping up the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Faction in the Countries; and the Pro&s;pect of that Scheme con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in the car|rying the next Election again&s;t the In|tere&s;t of the pre&s;ent Government, by the Force of the Deli&s;iom which they have &s;pread among the People, and by which they have poi&s;on'd their Princi|ples, and made them to wi&s;h Succe&s;s to tho&s;e De&s;igns, which would end in the Ruin of the Prote&s;tant Religion, and the Liberties and Privileges of their Country.</P>
<P>Nothing is more frequent in their Di&s;cour&s;es throughout the whole Nati|on, at this Time, than this: <Q>&startq;&endq;That the pre&s;ent Government have the Advan|tage for a while, by having a H&mdash;of C&mdash;to their Purpo&s;e; but that whenever they (the <HI>Tories)</HI> come to
<PB N="21" REF="20">
a new Election, which, <HI>&s;ay they,</HI> mu&s;t be within little more than a Year, we are &s;ure we have &s;o prepared the Peo|ple, and &s;o filled them with Prejudices again&s;t the pre&s;ent Government, that they will choo&s;e quite another Kind.</Q></P>
<P>That this is Fact, that the&s;e are the Hopes of the Party, and that this is di&s;|cover'd in their daily Di&s;cour&s;e, I think, even them&s;elves being Judges, there will be no occa&s;ion to prove; the Thing is not done or &s;aid in a Corner, as far as they dur&s;t, they have even printed the &s;ame Thing; and they are &s;o far from being backward, or a&s;ham'd in acknow|ledging the&s;e Things, that it is well known they boa&s;t of it, as a Thing they are well a&s;&s;ur'd of: Nay, if I have not very bad Intelligence, they bouy up their Friends Abroad with the Expecta|tion of it; and the Mini&s;ters of State in <HI>France</HI> are told, that if they can put off the Importunities of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Mini|&s;ters for one Year more, till the pre&s;ent Parliament has worn out its Time, and till they come to a new Election in <HI>England,</HI> they will &s;ee a quite different Face of Things appear here; that the Court will be &s;o embarra&s;s'd with the Parliament, that the Publick Affairs

will be in a quite different Scituation, and take a new Turn; that the People will then have a &s;afer and &s;urer Way, than that of Arms, to &s;hew their Aver|&s;ion to the Party who are now upper|mo&s;t; that they are &s;ure to beat them at Elections, tho' they could not in the Field; and that having once return'd but a Majority in the Hou&s;e of C&mdash;, it will &s;oon appear whether a King can rule in <HI>England</HI> again&s;t the Good Will of the People or no.</P>
<P>Now altho' this is made up of Rho|domontade and Blu&s;ter, and much of the Sub&s;tance of it would be void in its own Nature, <HI>even &s;uppo&s;ing the Par|liament &s;hould di&s;&s;olve at the Time, as by Virtue of the &s;aid Law it mu&s;t do;</HI> and tho' we are &s;atisfy'd that the pre&s;ent Go|vernment might maintain it&s;elf, in De|fiance of this Party, and make it appear that they are not &s;o much Ma&s;ters of the common People as they pretend to be: I &s;ay, tho' all the&s;e Things &s;eem to be vi&s;ible to us, who &s;ee the happy Suc|ce&s;s of the King's Affairs, the Vigour of his Maje&s;ty's Councils, and the &s;ure Steps taken in all his Mea&s;ures; yet &s;omething is to be &s;aid on the other hand, which makes the&s;e Things &s;eem of more Weight, at this Time, than o|therwi&s;e
<PB N="23" REF="22">
they might be, and that make it worth while to con&s;ider, whether &s;ome Mea&s;ures ought not to be taken, effectu|ally to di&s;appoint the Enemy in the Hopes they have rai&s;ed upon the&s;e Sug|ge&s;tions.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, it may be affirm'd, That while the Party have a View of the Deter|mination of this Parliament in the u&s;ual Cour&s;e, and of the great Things they may be able to do in a new Election, they will never give over their Attempts of debauching the Principles of the Country People, in order to &s;ecure their Intere&s;t in the approaching Elections. It is their Boa&s;t, that the Court has lo&s;t the People; perhaps it is our Opinion they have not: But to make it be be|liev'd they have, is in &s;ome Mea&s;ure to make it be &s;o; at lea&s;t, it is to help &s;uch a horrid Ca&s;e forward. They have then nothing to do, but to cultivate the wicked De&s;ign, to increa&s;e by all means po&s;&s;ible the Delu&s;ions and Di&s;affections of the common People, that if it be not true, they may make it true; and if it be true, they may increa&s;e it. This Occa&s;ion mu&s;t be taken from them, or they mu&s;t &s;ome way or other be di&s;|abled from making an Advantage of it:
<PB N="24" REF="23">
For, doubtle&s;s, while the Pro&s;pect re|mains, of the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party having a Majority in the next Parliament, they have an Argument that can never be re|futed, to keep up the Spirit of Faction and Fury among the People: I &s;ay, it is an Argument never to be an&s;wer'd, but by removing the Foundation, <HI>viz.</HI> the Hopes of having, in &s;o little Time, ano|ther Parliament more in their Intere&s;t, and which &s;hall give a Turn to the Pub|lick Affairs, in favour of their Party. This alone can put a Stop to their In|vention.</P>
<P>For, on the other hand, as they have now Lei&s;ure to &s;pread the Di&s;affection of their Party, and to lay a firm Foun|dation for future Mi&s;chiefs in the Mad|ne&s;s of the Rabbles; &s;o we may pa&s;s our Word for them, that they are no ill Husbands of the Time; that they &s;lip no Opportunities; nor are they want|ing in the lea&s;t to them&s;elves, or &s;lack in their Diligence. We have found they improve every Advantage with the ut|mo&s;t Application; nay, they &s;tudy for Occa&s;ions, and make them; rai&s;ing perpetual Rumours and Amu&s;ements at the Expence of Truth, and calculated for the main Work of impo&s;ing on the
<PB N="25" REF="24">
People. The&s;e they hand about as chary Di&s;coveries, tho' they are no more than the Product of a wicked Invention.</P>
<P>It would be endle&s;s to enter into the Particulars of the Clamours they have rai&s;ed, without the lea&s;t Foundation of Truth, as well again&s;t the Royal Family in general, as again&s;t the Per&s;on of the King, the Government in general, and the Mini|&s;try in particular. The&s;e Things were not worth Notice: His Maje&s;ty, as all ju&s;t Princes are, being above the Power of Slander, I mean as to his Per&s;on, would ra|ther pity, than puni&s;h the Weakne&s;s of his Enemies Malice, were it not that there are, on the other hand, a poor wandring Mul|titude, who&s;e Heads being intoxicated with the Trea&s;onable Vapours of the&s;e Mens Imaginations, are thereby turn'd delirious, and are ripen'd up for all Manner of Mi&s;|chief.</P>
<P>It is in Compa&s;&s;ion to the&s;e, and to pre|&s;erve them from de&s;troying them&s;elves, by driving them into the Hands of Ju&s;tice: I &s;ay, it is in Compa&s;&s;ion to the&s;e, if there were nothing el&s;e in it, that the Schemes and Projects of the other &s;hould be ex|pos'd and defeated, that, if it be po&s;&s;ible, Peace may be re&s;tored to a divided and abu&s;ed People, and that the People may be left at Liberty to &s;ee Things by a true Light, and with their own Eyes, unpre|judiced
<PB N="26" REF="25">
by the Artifice of the <HI>Jacobites,</HI> or of their In&s;truments, the Clergy.</P>
<P>Again, while the High-Flying Party have this Pro&s;pect, while they expect the Termination of the Parliament at the u&s;u|al Time, and while they believe the Influ|ence of their Delu&s;ions, and the Secrecy of their Teachers will obtain upon the People; and that it may be in their Power, by the&s;e Helps, to influence the Votes at the next Election: I &s;ay, if they have the&s;e Expectations, it cannot be expected that they will give over the horrid Practice of debauching the Principles of the Country People, and drawing them from their Duty: While their Hopes of Succe&s;s re|main, their Endeavour cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to cea&s;e; nay, as tho&s;e Hopes rather increa&s;e by the Approach of the Time, &s;o in Proportion will their malicious Contri|vances increa&s;e, and their Diligence quic|ken in the Work.</P>
<P>It is no uncommon Thing for the High Party to expo&s;e them&s;elves by their own Inadvertency, and ra&s;h boa&s;ting Speeches; nor do they oftner &s;peak the Truth of their own De&s;igns, than when they think they are Bullying and Ga&s;conading the <HI>Whigs:</HI> and I know nothing they do it more in, than in this very Ca&s;e I am &s;peaking of: Nothing is more frequent, than for them to tell us; <HI>That the Mini&s;try ought to im|prove</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="26">
<HI>the three Years they have in their Hands; that they have gotten a Parliament now to their Minds; but that they will ne|ver get &s;uch another: That now the People are of another Mind; their Eyes are opened, and they have different Opinions, both of Per&s;ons and Things, from what they had be|fore: That Mea&s;ures have been taken to do their Bu&s;ine&s;s in another Election; and that the People will take Care who they give their Votes for,</HI> &amp;c. If this is not true, <HI>as is ob&s;erv'd before,</HI> yet it is a good Argument to the Party, who talk after this Manner, to ju&s;tify taking them at their Word, and acting for the Prevention of it, ju&s;t as we &s;hould act, if we believ'd it to be true.</P>
<P>As their Expectation lies now all this Way, &s;o I think it may be truly &s;aid, it is the only Expectation, and all the Pro|&s;pect, of any Significance, that they have left. When this is over, they have &s;prung their la&s;t Mine: They have try'd all other Methods in vain; nothing has an&s;wer'd their End. Let us trace them in the Steps of their Di&s;affection: They fir&s;t try'd Tu|mult and Rabble; and at fir&s;t it &s;tood them in &s;ome &s;tead, as it rai&s;ed the Spirits of their Faction, to think them&s;elves a lit|tle formidable, and &s;o ripen'd them up for Rebellion and Civil War. But when both the Civil and Military Power took hold of them, and aw'd their Mobbs, they then
<PB N="28" REF="27">
tried open Rebellion; embarking a great many Gentlemen of Fortunes and Figure, who were blinded with <HI>Jacobite</HI> Zeal, and <HI>Popi&s;h,</HI> or wor&s;e, Principles; flatter'd and made vain with fal&s;e Encouragements both from Abroad, and at Home of powerful A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and Numbers of Revolters; em|barking them, I &s;ay, in a bold and bloody De&s;ign of depo&s;ing the pre&s;ent Settlement, and the King al&s;o, and &s;etting up a Foreign Idolater, a <HI>Pretender</HI> indeed by Progeny and by Principle; of a Religion incon&s;i|&s;tent, of Birth di&s;puted, and of a Branch hated and expell'd.</P>
<P>In this wicked Attempt they have been defeated by the Valour and Vig$lance of the Government, and the King's faithful Friends: They have not been able to exe|cute their own De&s;igns, neither by their Councils or Forces; they have been di&s;|cover'd in their Cabinet, and the Chain of their Trea&s;ons has been taken hold of Link by Link, before they had been able to perfect their Schemes, or concert their Mea&s;ures; as their Councils have been pe|netrated, &s;o their Expeditions have been overthrown till at la&s;t, tho' their Number has been &s;uperior, they have neither dared to put the I&s;&s;ue of their Cau&s;e to the Ar|bitration of the Sword, nor to the Voice of Heaven; but have quitted all they po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd; and abandoning the poor People
<PB N="29" REF="28">
they had drawn into their Snare, they have fled for Sanctuary to the remote Parts of the World, leaving the mi&s;erable Example of their for&s;aken Abetters, as a good Warning to all the People of <HI>Britain,</HI> to con&s;ider what is the certain End of li|&s;tening to the In&s;inuations of the&s;e Decei|vers, and how much more able they are to draw the poor People into De&s;truction, than to deliver them out of it.</P>
<P>And tho' it be a Digre&s;&s;ion here, yet I cannot omit recommending it to all the common People of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to look back upon the I&s;&s;ue of this unnatural At|tempt, and &s;ee, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> with what Blu&s;ter, what haughty Behaviour, what in&s;olent Boa&s;ts, the late Rebellion was undertaken; how they &s;upported the Delu&s;ions with improbable Stories, Forgeries and Fiction; and how, by this means, together with o|ther Artifices, Thou&s;ands were drawn in to join in their De&s;ign. And then, on the other hand, with what abject Ba&s;ene&s;s they de&s;erted their own Cau&s;e, for&s;ook tho&s;e who would have fought and died for them, and &s;hew'd the World, that tho' their Souls were &s;ufficiently infected with the Poi&s;on of Rebellion, yet that they had neither Heads or Hands for the Execution; that they had neither Council to direct, or Courage to execute, the great Undertaking they were engaged in. If this were duly
<PB N="30" REF="29">
reflected on, it would a&s;&s;i&s;t to expo&s;e the Party, and to undeceive the unhappy Peo|ple, who they are now dealing with, to carry on their De&s;igns again&s;t the Peace of their Country, and the Per&s;on of the King.</P>
<P>As they have been di&s;cover'd in their Councils, and defeated in their Camps; &s;o they have been di&s;appointed in their Friends; they entred into Negotiations A|broad, and Combinations at Home; but all their <HI>Achitophels</HI> have been defeated, and have had little left them to do, but to follow the Example of that fir&s;t <HI>Achito|phel,</HI> and <HI>go</HI> and <HI>Jet their Hou&s;es in Order,</HI> &amp;c. All their Negotiations for Foreign A&s;&s;i&s;tances have been counter-acted, and render'd abortive: The <HI>Spaniards</HI> will not, the <HI>French</HI> dare not, and other Princes cannot, a&s;&s;i&s;t them. They had obtained &s;ome Connivance in <HI>France;</HI> but the Re|gent was fain to di&s;own it again. This they call Temporizing in that Prince, and flatter them&s;elves, that he will alter his Mind upon &s;ome other Occa&s;ion: But the Chimera of this has been too weak to &s;upport them; and they begin to know now, that the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Court is too formi|dable in <HI>France,</HI> and the Report of the Weakne&s;s of the Rebels too certain al&s;o, to make it rational for the Regent to do any thing in their Favour, at lea&s;t, any
<PB N="31" REF="30">
thing incon&s;i&s;tent with his Engagements to us, or any thing that the King of <HI>Great Britain</HI> can have Rea&s;on to re&s;ent.</P>
<P>Thus &s;tand their Circum&s;tances with relation to what is pa&s;t: Every thing they have hoped for, has failed them; eve|ry thing they have undertaken, has mi&s;|carried; all their Friends have promi&s;ed them, has done them no Good; and all they have promis'd to others, has prov'd Chimerical and Whim&s;ical; all their Trea|&s;ons have been abortive in the Contri|vances, or deficient in their carrying on: And now they are at the Foot&s;tool of their Injur'd Soveraign, imploring his Clemency and Pardon, tho' <HI>even THAT</HI> they do al&s;o with &s;uch an imperfect Submi&s;&s;ion, &s;uch Reluctance, and with &s;uch evident Tokens of Minds fill'd with the &s;ame Ran|cour, and only wanting Power to execute their wicked Purpo&s;es, that 'tis not a Won|der only that they &s;hould find any Favour from his Maje&s;ty: <HI>Nor could that be, if his Maje&s;ty's Clemency and Goodne&s;s was not quite different from that of mo&s;t Princes in the World:</HI> But 'tis really wonderful, that they &s;hould have &s;o little Mode&s;ty as to ask it, or &s;o little Sen&s;e as to expect it.</P>
<P>Their Expectations being thus cro&s;s'd on every Side, and their Cau&s;e now &s;unk below any probable View of Succe&s;s, they have only one Card left to play; the Na|ture
<PB N="32" REF="31">
of the Thing admits of no other Turn to their De&s;igns; nothing el&s;e is be|fore them but this, <HI>viz.</HI> That, if po&s;&s;ible, they may keep up the Ferment and Di&s;af|fection in the Minds of the People, till the Election of a new Parliament; and then, if they can carry their Point, they will find that they &s;hall be able to fight the Government better in the Field of Ele|ctions, than in the Field of Battle; and wound the Con&s;titution deeper by the Clamours and Huzza's of the Mobs, in the re&s;pective Corporations, than by the Can|non and Bombs in a War.</P>
<P>This is the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e; <HI>and I hope it is impartially &s;tated.</HI> It remains then only to enquire, whether this is not one of tho&s;e critical Times, when it may be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;u&s;pend the Execution of the only Law, in which the&s;e malicious Peo|ple have placed all their remaining Expe|ctations. Whether the Rea&s;ons of their Boa&s;ting, are well founded or no. Why &s;hould we not take them at their Words? If their Hopes are built upon Chimera's, let us remove tho&s;e Chimera's; but if their Tru&s;t is in Shadows, even tho&s;e Shadows &s;hould be removed, that tho&s;e Hopes might vani&s;h, and that they may have no more room to tru&s;t in any thing; then they will have nothing to do but to &s;ub|mit.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="32">
I will not enter here into the Que&s;tion, whether there is any real Danger of their prevailing &s;o much by the Poy&s;on of their In&s;inuations, as to keep up the wicked Impre&s;&s;ions they have made among the People; I'll rather &s;uppo&s;e it as I would have it, <HI>viz.</HI> that it is not probable. But while they imagine otherwi&s;e, tho' they may be under a Delu&s;ion in that Point, yet there are many little Advantages to their Cau&s;e, and many Inconveniencies to the Government, to have them but able to keep alive their Expectations: And the Conque&s;t they make upon the Publick Peace by it is of Con&s;equence, tho' no|thing el&s;e were &s;o be&s;ides. In Matters of &s;uch Con&s;equence, what Rea&s;on is there to put any thing in hazard? What wi&s;e Man will run Ri&s;ques, that can be &s;ure? No Man is in Love with Danger, or fond of expo&s;ing what is valuable, without a valuable Con&s;ideration for his Ri&s;que. It is evident, the &s;u&s;pending this Law would as entirely extingui&s;h their Hopes, and lead them by the Hand to &s;uch Accommo|dations and Capitulations with the pre&s;ent Government as they could obtain; know|ing, that being able to &s;tand out no longer, they had be&s;t come in with as much Ad|vantage to them&s;elves as they can; know|ing, that the longer they delayed making their Peace, the harder it would be to
<PB N="34" REF="33">
bring it to pa&s;s, and the meaner the Con|ditions will be that they will be able to obtain; for Men always capitulate on &s;o much wor&s;e Terms, as bear a Proportion to the Length of Time that they held out.</P>
<P>It might be Time well employ'd, to en|ter into a Di&s;cour&s;e of the Particular Rea|&s;ons or Objections brought again&s;t &s;uch a Propo&s;al; but it would be only, that Time would be &s;pent in expo&s;ing the Ab|&s;urdity and Folly of the &s;eparate Rea&s;ons which are given always again&s;t it: <HI>Such as</HI> making dangerous Precedents, the Diffi|culty of bringing the Courts of our Princes to con&s;ent to re&s;toring a Law, which in|vades &s;o much the Power of Proroguing, and Di&s;&s;olving or Continuing a Parliament; a Right, which few of our Kings would have parted, for the Ea&s;e of his People, <HI>the</HI> Parting with &s;o e&s;&s;ential a Branch of the Privileges of <HI>Great Britain</HI> as this is, and on the enjoying which, &s;o much of our Safety depends.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Objections are effectually an|&s;wer'd, by &s;tating the Difference between &s;u&s;pending the Force of a Law for a cer|tain limited Time only, and the ab&s;olute r$pealing &s;uch a Law; nor is there any Occa&s;ion to &s;ay a Word more about it, only to let the Reader know, that not one Word in this Tract is to be under&s;tood to mean an ab&s;olute Repeal of &s;uch an Act,
<PB N="35" REF="34">
but a Temporary Su&s;pen&s;ion of the Law; the Limitation to expire at a certain Time, and the Law then to return to its full Force, unle&s;s tho&s;e Limitations &s;hould be farther extended by the &s;ame Authority, and upon the like Nece&s;&s;ity; of which Nece&s;&s;ity, the Parliament are always to be the Judges.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething offer'd indeed by the Enemies of this Propo&s;al, which I think may be &s;aid to be the only thing, at lea&s;t that I have met with, that has any Weight in it; and this is, That it is a dangerous Precedent, and may be made u&s;e of to the Prejudice of our Liberties in the Reigns of &s;ucceeding Princes: To this may be &s;aid, that if the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Ca&s;e be allow'd now, and that it ought to be done, we can &s;ay no more to Precedents than this, That when the Nece&s;&s;ity is the &s;ame, and a Prince upon the Throne equally to be de|pended upon, and equally concern'd for the Liberties of his People, as we all, without Flattery, believe his pre&s;ent Ma|je&s;ty to be; then we think the &s;ame thing may be done by our Po&s;terity. In the mean time, it is &s;ufficient to us to prove, that we are now in Circum&s;tances, which render it nece&s;&s;ary at this Time. If that be granted, we cannot an&s;wer for what our Po&s;terity may do with le&s;s Nece&s;&s;ity; the Fault will be theirs, not ours; and our
<PB N="36" REF="35">
Ca&s;e will be very unhappy indeed, if we &s;hall be oblig'd to refrain Things nece&s;&s;ary for the Publick Safety, in a Time of Dan|ger and of open Rebellion, becau&s;e our Po&s;terity may make an ill U&s;e of it. This might be argued again&s;t all the mo&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ary Things that a Nation can be called upon to do, and would make Government it&s;elf in many Ca&s;es impracticable.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this Argument with proving, that as nothing but &s;uch a Step as this can, at this Time, give a Check to the Faction, and effectually extingui&s;h their Hopes; &s;o this Step, if the Govern|ment &s;hould think proper to come into it, would effectually di&s;courage it, and indeed would give the <HI>Coup de Grace,</HI> or the mortal Blow to <HI>Jacobiti&s;m</HI> in this Na|tion.</P>
<P>It is no Compliment to the pre&s;ent Hou&s;e of Commons, to &s;ay of them, that the like Body of Gentlemen, for their Una|nimity in the Pro&s;ecution of the Rebels, their Steddine&s;s to the Intere&s;t of King <HI>George,</HI> and their Zeal for the Good of their Country, has not for many Years met within tho&s;e Walls; and perhaps the <HI>Jaco|bites</HI> may in this &s;ay true, that &s;uch another Election never can be made. If $$$&s;e Gentlemen continue, the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> may &s;ing their <HI>Dirges</HI> over the Corps of de|parted <HI>Jacobiti&s;m,</HI> and give Money to pray
<PB N="37" REF="36">
for the Soul of Rebellion. They may take their Leaves of them for this Reign; they can never revive in this Nation: A King &s;o e&s;tabli&s;h'd, &s;o &s;upported, and a Parlia|ment &s;o attach'd to his Intere&s;t, Family, and Per&s;on, can never be, and was never yet &s;upplanted in this Nation.</P>
<P>Nothing is more frequent, than to hear the High-Church Men &s;ay, We mu&s;t not do our Work this Way: We mu&s;t take o|ther Mea&s;ures; there is nothing to be done while this Parliament is in Being; the Hou&s;e of Commons act with &s;o much Vigour and Steddine&s;s with the King, that they make them&s;elves a Terror to all the Foreign Powers of <HI>Europe,</HI> many of whom would otherwi&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;t us openly: We mu&s;t wait, therefore, a while, the Days of their Di&s;&s;olution are at hand; then we hope to have a Hou&s;e to our Minds, and an Intere&s;t that &s;hall prevent their running thus glibly on. If we carry our Point there, all is our own; but, as it is, we can|not make any Attempt.</P>
<P>The&s;e are their Speeches; nor is the Fact to be doubted. If this Parliament conti|nue, the <HI>Jacobites</HI> are gone, entirely lo&s;t; and their Cau&s;e can never have a Re&s;urre|ction in this Country. If this Parliament goes off, they have another Game for it; and if they &s;hould out-wit us in &s;huffling the Cards, and bring all the Trumps into
<PB N="38" REF="37">
their own Hands, the be&s;t Cau&s;e in the World may be lo&s;t; and &s;o the Nation may be again put to the Hazard of fight|ing all the&s;e Battles over again.</P>
<P>But if the Parliament be now continued for &s;uch a Time as &s;hall be thought proper, <HI>the Game</HI> is then <HI>&V; P,</HI> the Show is over, the <HI>Pretender</HI> may e'en go and buy Land in <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland,</HI> or in <HI>Mountbelliard,</HI> or where|ever he plea&s;es; he will never &s;ind any more in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> than what his Cof|fin &s;hould take up when they came to bury him.</P>
<P>It is indeed next to impo&s;&s;ible, that with &s;uch a King to reign, and &s;uch a Parlia|ment to &s;tand by him, the <HI>Pretender,</HI> or his Friends at Home, much le&s;s tho&s;e A|broad, can any way &s;hake the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Con|&s;titution.</P>
<P>It would be imitating our <HI>Tories</HI> in that very Thing which renders them the mo&s;t contemptible, if I &s;hould <HI>Ga&s;conade them</HI> upon this Subject; declaring the Con&s;ti|tution invulnerable, and bidding Defiance to all the Enemies of our Government to do their wor&s;t. NO, NO, <HI>Cae&s;ar's</HI> Rule is to be ob&s;erv'd here, never to de&s;pi&s;e an Enemy: Our way is, not to harbour any needle&s;s Apprehen&s;ions; but at the &s;ame time not to imagine our Con&s;titution to be invulnerable, and &s;o become &s;ecure. We have the Watch, and 'tis our Duty to be
<PB N="39" REF="38">
vigilant again&s;t the lea&s;t Occa&s;ion of En|couragement given our Enemies, and to take all imaginable Care to make them De&s;pair.</P>
<P><HI>I &s;peak it with due Re&s;erve to Provi|dence.</HI> Nothing el&s;e can &s;o effectually bring the Enemy to de&s;pair of Succe&s;s, at this Time, as giving a new Life to this Parliament. This Hou&s;e of Commons is the Terror of Rebels, and the Dread of all their Foreign Alliances. While this Parli|ament &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, Foreign Powers, tho' they &s;hew their Teeth, yet keep their Di&s;tance; if the Allies of the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party are wil|ling to help them, yet they are not a&s;ham'd to acknowledge, that they care not to em|broil them&s;elves with the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parlia|ment. Even King <HI>George</HI> him&s;elf is made more Terrible by the Acce&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a Hou&s;e of Commons. While the&s;e remain, what A&s;&s;i&s;tance the Rebel Intere&s;t obtain, is by Stealth, Connivance, and with all po&s;&s;ible Concealment. If the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> En|voy does but remon&s;trate, they tremble, eat their Words, deny to have known what is charg'd upon them, pretend to puni&s;h tho&s;e, that even before they encourag'd; and, like a Servant under Correction, make Promi&s;es to offend no more.</P>
<P>At Home 'tis the &s;ame: This Hou&s;e of Commons is the Dread of <HI>Jacobiti&s;m;</HI> their very Breath &s;trikes Rebellion with Convul&s;ions and Death. The Rebels, even
<PB N="40" REF="39">
in their Pro&s;perity, tremble at the unani|mous Re&s;olutions of the Hou&s;e: Upon the bare Votes of a&s;&s;i&s;ting and &s;upporting King <HI>George,</HI> the Arms fell out of their Hands, they quit their Advantages, &s;catter and di&s;|per&s;e, flying for Life to every Corner of the World.</P>
<P>This is the Hou&s;e of Commons, of whom the High Party &s;ay, We &s;hall never have &s;uch another: To which I know no An&s;wer more proper to be given than this; That then it is our Bu&s;ine&s;s to keep them while we have them. They, <HI>the Tories,</HI> &s;ay, if this Hou&s;e of Commons <HI>Die,</HI> we are undone: To which <HI>the Whigs</HI> may an|&s;wer them, That if this Hou&s;e of Com|mons <HI>Lives,</HI> they are undone; with this Addition, that we do not grant the fir&s;t, and they cannot deny the la&s;t.</P>
<P>If <HI>this Hou&s;e</HI> be voted longer liv'd, we may give one another Joy of a &s;ure E&s;ta|bli&s;hment, at lea&s;t as to <HI>Jacobiti&s;m;</HI> not all the Devils in Hell, nor all the Powers of Men; nor all the Contrivances of St. <HI>Germains, Rome,</HI> or <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> can be able to wound the E&s;tabli&s;hment of this Na|tion.</P>
