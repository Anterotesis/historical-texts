James call up the carriages, and &s;ee the company di&s;po&s;ed of. I'm &s;o fatigued!&mdash;heigh-ho!&mdash;&s;even o'clock again!&mdash;I hav'nt been to bed any &s;ooner this fortnight.</P>

<P>&mdash;Here's my fretful hu&s;band ju&s;t got up!&mdash;he's &s;o old fa&s;hion'd, and &s;o &s;our; he's never plea&s;ed, but when others are vexed; and never unhappy, but when his friends are happy.</P>

<P>&mdash;P&s;ha! you've no idea of life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;No; but I have of death. It would kill me in a fortnight; be&s;ides every body laughs at you. Not one of your acquaintance, who by the bye have loved and hated each other all round, but on leaving the room exclaims, "Well, it's very fine, mighty grand; but will it la&s;t; won't there be a cru&s;h by and bye."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady A</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;Ridiculous, Sir Andrew. An't I vi&s;itted by
<PB N="4" REF="4">every body? Don't all the beau monde attend Lady Acid's parties?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;The beau monde! Why they'll vi&s;it any body that is fool enough to invite them; let who will give an expen&s;ive entertainment, they'll flock to it, like rooks about a ruin&mdash;but this won't do; it's &s;even o'clock, and I mu&s;t be eating. Here&mdash;you, Sir, bring my break|fa&s;t,</P>

<P>&mdash;Yes, here, &s;ir. I'm &s;ure the beau monde, as your Lady&s;hip calls them, will have no objection to &s;omething &s;ub&s;tantial. Poor Devils! at the&s;e &s;ort of parties, they get nothing to feed on but &s;candal and Faro.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady A</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;Provoking, Sir Andrew, you're always teaz|ing and vexing me, and I in&s;i&s;t on knowing what part of my conduct&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;Hold&mdash;don't &s;uppo&s;e I &s;u&s;pect your charac|ter; no, 'mid&s;t all your gaieties, I &s;till believe you to be &s;o con&s;tant and honourable, that there's no indulg|ing one's &s;elf in finding fault with you.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady A</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;If you don't think &s;o, your cou&s;in Colonel Hubbub does, or he never would have tru&s;ted me with the care of his niece Honoria. But I leave you to your ill-nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;Aye; go to bed. You to your pillow, I to my coffee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady A</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;Mind me, Sir. If you &s;ee Honoria, give her the advice I de&s;ired you. Tell her the Colonel has written for his Ward Mr. Nominal, to challenge that wretch Clairville, and that I &s;hall do all in my power to give her to Lord Jargon; and &s;o good night, mo&s;t good humour'd hu&s;band.</P>

<P>&mdash;Do they! take &s;ome breakfa&s;t</P>
<STAGE><HI>[offering her &s;ome.]</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon</SPEAKER>
<P>What have I been doing to-night, Sir! talking to men I dete&s;t, and li&s;tening to women I de&s;pi&s;e; mix|ing with people who have neither feeling, amity, nor &s;en&s;e. This I have done for years, and this I mu&s;t &s;till per&s;evere in; for my education has taught me to &s;mile when I was mi&s;erable, and to be fa&s;hionable at the ex|pence of my peace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;Sweet creature; how prettily &s;he prattles, Go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;Yes, Sir; with a mind naturally attached to dome&s;tic happine&s;s, I am compelled to deride all peace|ful &s;cenes, becau&s;e my uncle the Colonel, who has cruelly delivered me to the care of your wife, &s;ir&mdash;but I interrupt you, I &s;ee I do&mdash;I'll keep my &s;orrows to my&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;Don't&mdash;don't keep them to your&s;elf. I like to hear you talk about &s;orrow and mi&s;ery; and if you know of any more el&s;ewhere, you'll not offend me by imparting it. But now I think on't, tell me that un|lucky &s;tory of the fellow a&s;cending your window by a rope-ladder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;Fellow! Sir Andrew&mdash;when you are more
<PB N="6" REF="6">re&s;pectful, I'll talk to you&mdash;till when&mdash;</P>
<STAGE><HI>[Going.]</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A&mdash;<HI>[Stopping her]</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Stay be not offended: I'll &s;ym|pathize with you, Honoria; I'll give you &s;igh for &s;igh, and tear for tear. Come, make me your confidant, and you &s;han't repent it; nay, you mu&s;t, you &s;hall. I do love to hear a tale of woe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon&mdash;<HI>[Sighing]</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh &s;ir! How have I been &s;landered and defamed. I never knew Mr. Clairville, but as a friend, as a protector. That we had &s;ecret meetings I cannot deny: but I was never alone; your Ward Sophia was always pre&s;ent, and &s;he will witne&s;s to the world, that he was too honourable to make ba&s;e propo&s;als, and I too unfa&s;hionable to accept them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;Go on; I like to hear you, Honoria; if I re|member, your acquaintance began at the Colonel's villa in the I&s;le of Wight, when you were &s;ailing and fell from the ve&s;&s;el.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;Yes, Sir; and while his brother Lord Jargon and other foplings of the party, who before had offered up their lives to &s;erve me, while they &s;tood idly on the deck, and &s;aw me ju&s;t expiring. Clairville, then a &s;tran|ger, leap'd from another ve&s;&s;el, and plunging 'mid&s;t the waves, caught me in his arms, and brough me &s;afe to land. Then came the conflict. The Colonel's boat, by adver&s;e winds was blown from &s;hore, and I and my Deliverer remained part of that day alone. I &s;aw, com|par'd, and lov'd. His heart beat in uni&s;on with mine; and now, &s;ir, do you pity or condemn me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;I pity you, pity you &s;incerely, and cur&s;e the Colonel for placing you under the care of my wife, be|cau&s;e I know &s;he de&s;igns you for Lord Jargon. But Nominal, whom your uncle intends for your hu&s;band, who is hourly expected from France.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;Talk not of that, &s;ir; for I dread the con|&s;equences of his arrival. The night Clairville was di&s;|covered in my apartment, the Colonel told him, he would &s;end for his Ward Nominal, to avenge the in|jured honour of his family. Ah, &s;ir! if a duel &s;hould en&s;ue&mdash;yet if Clairville receives my letter, that and other ills may be prevented <STAGE><HI>[a&s;ide]</HI></STAGE> but &s;omebody is coming, &s;ir; allow me to retire.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="7" REF="7">
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;Do, and depend on my pro$ection, Honoria; I am always a friend to the unhappy. Good morning.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Honoria exit&punc;</HI></STAGE>
<P>So there goes another long face.&mdash;Here's my Ward the celebrated Mi&s;s Alltrade; &s;he is an authore&s;s, an actre&s;s, a mu&s;ician, a painter, and in &s;hort, every thing. I know &s;he's in love with me, and I'll have the &s;atisfaction of teazing her &s;oul out.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Mi&s;s</HI> STRANGEWAY, <HI>with a Paper in her hand.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sophia</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;Po&s;itively I will be revenged. The Colonel does nothing but make love to me&mdash;heigh-ho!&mdash;I'm &s;o fatigued, Gaurdy&mdash;and it's vain going to bed, for I've &s;o many places to call at</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;What! all over the town, as u&s;ual.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;Yes; fir&s;t I'm going to Lady Bu&s;tle's, to fini&s;h my picture of her little French lap-dog: then to call at the book&s;eller's, and correct the pre&s;s; then to leave this farewel ode to my dear Jugglamintha, at the new&s;paper office,</P>

</SP>
<Q><L>"Oh! thou who&s;e amaranthine feelings know,</L>
<L>"The iron agonies of copper woe."</L></Q>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;Iron agonies of copper woe&mdash;that's a fine line, and charmingly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;Yes&mdash;then I'm going to rehear&s;e a new Tra|gedy at the private Theatre, and if you'll believe me, my dying &s;cene is yet un&s;ettled.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;That's a great pity, Sophia; for I think the dying &s;cene the be&s;t part of the play.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;Yes; but one in&s;i&s;ts on my dying on one &s;ide of the &s;tage; another on the other&mdash;now what am I to do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;Why what many great politicians have done before you! die between both &s;ides. But, my angel, when am I to be honour'd with an a&s;&s;ignation&mdash;a-tete-a-tete&mdash;heh!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;Fie, Guardy; you know I told you I lov'd you better than the old Colonel, and&mdash;that I'd make fools of you both, before I'd done with you,</P>
<STAGE><HI>[a&s;ide.]</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Whack&mdash;<HI>without,</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Arrah! &s;tand by now!&mdash;I am the valet de chambre de Mr. Nominal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;As I live, Nominal is arrived. This is his Iri&s;h &s;ervant, who to his brogue has joined a &s;mattering
<PB N="8" REF="8">of French&mdash;do &s;tay, and hear him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>&mdash;What! mix Iri&s;h with French.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;So it &s;eems&mdash;but here he comes.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> O'WHACK, <HI>followed by</HI> JAMES.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'W</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;Blood and ounds! don't you know me by my Polite&s;&s;e!&mdash;Jontleman and Lady, your mo&s;t obedient. By the red no&s;e of St. Patrick, I am toute nouveau; and d'ye &s;ee, I would be after &s;peaking to my ma&s;ter's Guar|dian Colonel Hubbub.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;How is your ma&s;ter? Is he as &s;ingular as his Guardian de&s;cribes him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;Singular! What, is he like the Colonel, Sir Andrew?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;The image of him. While at College his love of Notoriety fir&s;t di&s;played it&s;elf, but by living entirely with Engli&s;h abroad, he is become as eccentric and ab|&s;urd as the Colonel wi&s;hes him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'W</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;By Ja&s;us, you've hit it&mdash;ma foi&mdash;he is toujours wanting to get into notice, and between our three &s;elves, he keeps me as his Valet, Fri&s;&s;eur, and all that, only beca&s;e I perplex, make a noi&s;e, and am quite au fait at botheration wherever I go!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;Pray what brings Mr. Nominal &s;o &s;uddenly from France? Is'nt it &s;omething about an affair of honour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'W</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;Oui&mdash;you may &s;ay that. He is come to chal|lenge one Clairville, for getting into the window of Madamoi&s;elle Honoria; and to be &s;ure he won't give the young &s;educer a little &s;nug dejeune of cold lead.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;'Tis &s;o, then&mdash;poor Clairville.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;Tell us now, had you a plea&s;ant journey?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'W</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;Plea&s;ant!&mdash;Oh by the eternal Powers, toute au contraire, my dear: we were &s;topp'd and robb'd and murder'd&mdash;that is, we &s;hould have been, but for a fine young haro who came and <HI>re&s;cued</HI> us; Mardleu! he made them &s;kip like frogs!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir A</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;A robbery and duel: this journey may produce much plea&s;ing di&s;tre&s;s. Pray, who was this young hero?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'W</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;Je ne &s;ais pas lioney&mdash;but you may talk of your Cae&s;ars, Cleopatras and Paddy Whacks; he beats all your champions of po&s;terity. Oh! had you &s;een when
<PB N="9" REF="9">my ma&s;ter and I were &s;prawling, how he laid about him with his bit of timber. Depend on't, as our Fille de Chambre &s;aid, the Shillaly is the true je ne &s;ais quoi after all!</P>
