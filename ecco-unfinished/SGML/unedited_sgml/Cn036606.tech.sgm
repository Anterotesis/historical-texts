<HEAD>Tenth VISION.</HEAD>
<P>BY what A&s;pect our u&s;ual Appearances have
at our Tenth Ob&s;ervation, I &s;ee Hopes
that the End of the Year clo&s;es with <HI>Peace,</HI> and
for that rea&s;on I give you but <HI>Ten Vi&s;ions</HI> for
this Year, whereas before it was in <HI>Twelve.</HI>
The Allies of <HI>Britain</HI> concluding, or not conclu|ding,
we allow our &s;elves to be in <HI>Peace:</HI> The
General Treaty eminently manag'd by the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
Influence, may not yet have effectually been fi|ni&s;hed,
but the <HI>Peace</HI> as entertain'd by the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI>
Sovereign, appears made for our &s;elves, and
&s;uch of our Allies as &s;tand with us; the re&s;t
complain loudly, and talk high, but &s;ee a Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of Complying, and putting an End to the
War which now every Body think better of than
they did before.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="22">
Many of my Second-Sighted Friends &s;ay openly
that they &s;ee farther than I have done into the&s;e
Things, which I will not deny; they pretend
to &s;ee that the <HI>Peace</HI> was made &s;ome time &s;ince,
with ill Views and ill Pro&s;pects, and by ill Men,
and will but ill la&s;t, and that many ill Con&s;e|quences
&s;hall happen from it; but I &s;hall rather
publi&s;h my own Views, and what my own Sight
di&s;covers, than what the&s;e Men &s;ay: I cannot &s;ay
with Verity that I have &s;uch black Sights beyond
the Peace as they have, and therefore &s;ay to my
Countrymen and Friends, That if the ill Things
do follow the Peace which the&s;e Men predict, it
mu&s;t, very much of it, be the Mi&s;-management of
our own &s;elves at Home that may procure it, and
that therefore, if they plea&s;e, the <HI>Peace</HI> &s;hall be
well or ill for them: Among tho&s;e who have
it &s;o much in their Power to better to us the
Effects of <HI>Peace,</HI> none &s;o much as tho&s;e who
make it; who, if they will prevent the Influences
of <HI>France</HI> over Affairs in <HI>Britain,</HI> and in the re&s;t
of <HI>Europe,</HI> que&s;tionle&s;s may cau&s;e the Effects of
this <HI>Peace</HI> to be le&s;s hurtful to <HI>Britain</HI> than o|therwi&s;e
it would be: The&s;e Men can, no doubt,
prevent the Dangers of the Party who favour a
Wrong Succe&s;&s;ion, and can bring the Nation to
a more &s;ettled Condition in that Affair than we
are in at pre&s;ent: Whether they &s;hall do this or
not; whether they &s;hall take Effectual Care or
no to prevent the Fears of the People, and farther
to &s;ecure us after a <HI>Peace,</HI> I &s;hall give a more
direct Account of in my next Year's Predictions.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="23">
The two la&s;t Months of this Year threaten
great Lo&s;s and De&s;truction in <HI>Europe</HI> by unu&s;ual
Tempe&s;ts, e&s;pecially about <HI>November,</HI> the ga|thering.
Torrents I &s;ee evidently in the Air, and
all the Heats of Summer furni&s;h Vapour for this
Irruption; it is probable the &s;ame &s;hall be attend|ed
with great Innundations of Water.</P>
<P>Some great Calamity threatens <HI>Germany</HI> and
<HI>Hungary;</HI> whether the <HI>Northern</HI> War &s;hall break
out again, or whether the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;hall fall in upon
the Empire, does not yet appear, but it &s;eems that
the War in the <HI>North,</HI> notwith&s;tanding all the
Endeavours of the Princes of <HI>Germany</HI> to put an
End to it, &s;hall not be finally concluded during
the length of the&s;e Predictions.</P>
<P>The Plague, as is u&s;ual at this Sea&s;on of the
Year, cea&s;es, or rather takes Breath only to re|vive
with the more Fury, and if my <HI>Second Sight</HI>
&s;ays true to me, the next Year it &s;hall begin in
