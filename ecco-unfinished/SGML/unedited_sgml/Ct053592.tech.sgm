<HEAD>Dr. CHEYNE's
Own ACCOUNT of
HIMSELF.</HEAD>
<P>_I Was born of healthy Parents, in the <HI>Prime</HI>
of their Days, but di&s;po&s;ed to <HI>Corpulence</HI>
by the whole Race of one Side of my Fa|mily.
I pa&s;&s;ed my Youth in clo&s;e Study,
and almo&s;t con&s;tant Application to the
<HI>ab&s;tracted Sciences,</HI> and con&s;equently in
great Temperance and a &s;edentary Life; yet not &s;o
much, but that I &s;ometimes kept <HI>Holyday,</HI> diverted
my&s;elf with the Works of Imagination, and rouzed
Nature by ageeable Company and good Cheer.</P>
<P>Upon my coming to <HI>London,</HI> I, all of a &s;udden,
chang'd my whole Manner of Living: I found the
<HI>Bottle Companions,</HI> the <HI>younger Gentry,</HI> and <HI>Free-livers,</HI>
to be the mo&s;t ea&s;y of <HI>Acce&s;s,</HI> and mo&s;t quickly &s;u&s;|ceptible
of <HI>Friend&s;hip</HI> and <HI>Acquaintance;</HI> nothing being
nece&s;&s;ary for that Purpo&s;e, but to be able to <HI>eat</HI> lu&s;ti|ly,
and &s;wallow down much <HI>Liquor;</HI> and being natu|rally
of a large Size, a chearful Temper, and tolera|ble
lively <HI>Imagination;</HI> and having, in my Country
Retirement, laid in Store of <HI>Ideas</HI> and <HI>Facts;</HI> by the&s;e
Qualifications I &s;oon became care&s;&s;ed by them, and
grew daily in <HI>Bulk</HI> and in <HI>Friend&s;hip</HI> with the&s;e gay
Gentlemen and their Acquaintances.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="6">
I was tempted to continue this Cour&s;e, no Doubt
from a Liking, as well as to force a <HI>Trade,</HI> which
Method I had ob&s;erved to &s;ucceed with &s;ome others;
and thus con&s;tantly dining and &s;upping in <HI>Taverns,</HI>
and in the Hou&s;es of my Acquaintances of <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> and
<HI>Delicacy,</HI> my Health was in a few Years brought into
great Di&s;tre&s;s, by &s;o &s;udden and violent a Change. I
grew exce&s;&s;ively <HI>fat, &s;hort-breath'd, lethargic,</HI> and
<HI>li&s;tle&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He then gives an</HI> Account <HI>of a violent</HI> Fever <HI>he was
&s;eized with, and proceeds,</HI> p. 327.</P>
<P>At this Time I left off <HI>Suppers</HI> of all Kinds, even
at <HI>Dinner</HI> eating but a &s;mall Quantity of <HI>Animal Food,</HI>
and drinking very little fermented Liquor, well know|ing
that <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es</HI> mu&s;t always be cured by their Con|traries.
On this Occa&s;ion, all my <HI>bouncing, prote&s;t|ing,
undertaking</HI> Companions for&s;ook me, and dropp'd
off like Autumn Leaves: They could not bear, it
&s;eems, to &s;ee their Companion in &s;uch Mi&s;ery, but
retired to comfort them&s;elves with a <HI>cheerupping</HI> Cup,
leaving me to pa&s;s the melancholy Moments with my
own Apprehen&s;ions and Remor&s;e. Even tho&s;e who
had &s;hared the be&s;t Part of my Profu&s;ions, who, in
their Nece&s;&s;ities, had been a&s;&s;i&s;ted by my fal&s;e Gene|ro&s;ity,
and, in their Di&s;orders, relieved by my Care,
did now entirely abandon me; &s;o that I was forc'd
to retire into the Country quite alone, being reduced
to the State of Cardinal <HI>Wol&s;ey,</HI> when he &s;aid, that
<HI>if he had &s;erved his</HI> Maker <HI>as faithfully and warmly as
he had his</HI> Prince, <HI>he would not have for&s;aken him in
that Extremity:</HI> And &s;o will every one find, when <HI>U|nion</HI>
and <HI>Friend&s;hip</HI> is not founded on <HI>&s;olid Virtue,</HI> and
in Conformity to the <HI>divine Order,</HI> but in <HI>&s;en&s;ual Plea|&s;ures</HI>
and mere <HI>Jollity.</HI> This Circum&s;tance I mention,
<PB N="3" REF="7">
becau&s;e I thought then, it had &s;ome Share in my &s;uc|ceeding
<HI>Melancholy,</HI> p. 330.</P>
<P>While I was thus for&s;aken by my <HI>Holiday</HI> Friends,
and my Body was, as it were, melting away like a
<HI>Snow-ball</HI> in Summer, being dejected, <HI>melancholy,</HI> and
much confined at Home, by a Cour&s;e of <HI>mineral</HI> Me|dicines,
and Country Retirement, I had a long Sea|&s;on
for <HI>Meditation</HI> and <HI>Reflection,</HI> (my Faculties being
then as clear and quick as ever) which I was the
more readily led into, that I concluded my&s;elf infalli|bly
entering into an <HI>unknown State of Things.</HI></P>
<P>Having had a <HI>liberal</HI> and <HI>regular</HI> Education, with
the In&s;truction and Example of pious Parents (who
at fir&s;t had de&s;igned me for the <HI>Church</HI>) I had pre|&s;erved
a firm Per&s;ua&s;ion of the great and fundamental
Principles of all <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Morality; viz.</HI> The <HI>Ex|i&s;tence</HI>
of a <HI>&s;upreme</HI> and <HI>infinitely perfect Being,</HI> the
<HI>Freedom</HI> of the <HI>Will,</HI> the <HI>Immortality</HI> of the <HI>Spirits</HI> of
all <HI>intelligent Beings,</HI> and the Certainty of <HI>future Re|wards</HI>
or <HI>Puni&s;hments.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Doctrines I had examined carefully and had
been confirmed in, from <HI>ab&s;tracted Rea&s;onings,</HI> as well
as from the be&s;t <HI>natural Philo&s;ophy,</HI> and &s;ome clearer
Knowledge of the <HI>material Sy&s;tem</HI> of the World in ge|neral,
and the Wi&s;dom, Fitne&s;s, and beautiful Con|trivance
of particular Things, animated and inanima|ted;
&s;o that the Truth and Nece&s;&s;ity of the&s;e <HI>Prin|ciples</HI>
was &s;o riveted in me (which may be &s;een by the
fir&s;t Edition of my <HI>Philo&s;ophical Principles,</HI> publi&s;hed
&s;ome Years before that happen'd) as never after to be
&s;haken in all my Wanderings and Follies: And I had
then the Con&s;olation to reflect, that in my loo&s;e&s;t
Days, I had never <HI>pimp'd</HI> to the <HI>Vices</HI> or <HI>Infidelity</HI> of
<PB N="4" REF="8">
any, but was always a determined Adver&s;ary to
both.</P>
<P>But I found, that the&s;e alone were not &s;ufficient
to quiet my Mind at that Juncture, e&s;pecially when
I began to con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly, whether I might not
(thro' <HI>Carele&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Self-Sufficiency, Voluptuou&s;ne&s;s</HI>
and Love of <HI>Sen&s;uality,</HI> which might have impaired
my <HI>Spiritual</HI> Nature) have neglected to examine
with &s;ufficient Care; if there might not be more
required of tho&s;e who had had proper <HI>Opportunities</HI>
and <HI>Lei&s;ure;</HI> if there might not, I &s;ay, be higher,
more noble, and more enlightening <HI>Principles</HI> re|vealed
to Mankind <HI>&s;ome where;</HI> and if there were
not more encouraging and enlivening <HI>Motives</HI> propo|&s;ed,
to form a more exten&s;ive and <HI>heroic</HI> Virtue upon,
than tho&s;e ari&s;ing from <HI>Natural Religion</HI> only (for then
I had gone little farther than to have taken <HI>Chri&s;tia|nity</HI>
and <HI>Revelation</HI> on Tru&s;t) and la&s;tly, if there were
not likewi&s;e &s;ome clearer Accounts di&s;coverable of
that <HI>State</HI> I was then (I thought) apparently going
into, than could be obtained from the mere Light of
<HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Philo&s;ophy.</HI></P>
<P>Such were my Reflections in this my <HI>melancholy</HI> Re|tirement;
and this led me to call to Mind, which of
all my numerous and various <HI>Acquaintances</HI> I could
wi&s;h to re&s;emble mo&s;t, now in the&s;e my (to me
&s;eemingly approaching) la&s;t Moments; and who, a|mong
all tho&s;e of my particular Acquaintances, was
<HI>he,</HI> who being of &s;ound <HI>natural,</HI> and duly <HI>cultivated</HI>
Parts, had mo&s;t &s;trictly and con&s;tantly liv'd up to
their Convictions under the commonly received Prin|ciples,
and plain Con&s;equencies of <HI>Chri&s;tianity:</HI> In
a Word, who it was I could remember to have
received, and lived up to the plain Truths and
<PB N="5" REF="9">
Precepts contain'd in the <HI>Go&s;pels,</HI> or more particu|larly
in our <HI>Saviour's Sermon</HI> on the <HI>Mount.</HI></P>
<P>At that Time, among many whom my Memo|ry
&s;ugge&s;ted to me, I fix'd on one, a worthy and
learned <HI>Clergyman</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> &s;uffici|ently
known and di&s;tingui&s;hed in the <HI>Philo&s;ophical</HI>
and <HI>Theological</HI> World (whom I dare not name, be|cau&s;e
he is &s;till living, tho' now extremely old;)
and as in &s;tudying <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> and in running
over (as I was able) Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>'s <HI>Philo&s;ophical</HI>
Works, I had always pick'd out, and mark'd down,
the <HI>Authors</HI> and Writings mo&s;tly u&s;ed and recom|mended
by tho&s;e others, and by Him, becau&s;e I
thought they could be&s;t judge of &s;uch; &s;o in this
Ca&s;e, the more quickly to &s;ettle my Mind, and
quiet my Con&s;cience, I re&s;olved to purcha&s;e, &s;tudy,
and examine carefully, &s;uch <HI>Spiritual</HI> and <HI>Dogmatick</HI>
Authors, as I knew this <HI>venerable Man</HI> did mo&s;t
approve and delight in.</P>
<P>In this Manner I collected a Set of religious Books
and Writers, of mo&s;t of the fir&s;t Ages &s;ince <HI>Chri&s;ti|anity,</HI>
recommended by him, with a few others of the
mo&s;t <HI>&s;piritual</HI> of the <HI>Moderns,</HI> which have been my
<HI>Study, Delight,</HI> and <HI>Entertainment,</HI> in my Retirements
ever &s;ince: And on the&s;e I have formed my <HI>Ideas,
Principles,</HI> and <HI>Sentiments;</HI> &s;o as under all the Varie|ties
of <HI>Opinions, Sects, Di&s;putes,</HI> and <HI>Controver&s;ies,</HI>
that of late, and &s;ince the earlie&s;t Ages, have been
canva&s;&s;ed and bandied in the World, I have &s;carce e|ver
&s;ince been the lea&s;t &s;haken, or tempted to change
my Sentiments or Opinions, or &s;o much as to he&s;itate
in any material Point.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="10">
This tedious, perhaps, impertinent Circum&s;tance
I mention, becau&s;e the <HI>Fright, Anxiety, Dread,</HI> and
<HI>Terror,</HI> which, in Minds of &s;uch a Turn as mine (e&s;|pecially
under a broken and <HI>cachectick</HI> Con&s;titution,
and in &s;o atrocious a <HI>nervous</HI> Ca&s;e) ari&s;es, or at lea&s;t,
is exa&s;perated from &s;uch Reflections, being once &s;et|led
and quieted, <HI>That</HI> after becomes an excellent <HI>Cor|dial,</HI>
and a con&s;tant Source of <HI>Peace, Tranquillity,</HI> and
<HI>Chearfulne&s;s,</HI> and &s;o greatly contributes to forward
the Cure of &s;uch <HI>nervous</HI> Di&s;ea&s;es: For I never found
any &s;en&s;ible Tranquillity or Amendment, 'till I came
to this firm and &s;etled Re&s;olution in the main; <HI>viz.
To neglect nothing to &s;ecure my eternal Peace, more than
if I had been certified I &s;hould die within the Day; nor
to mind any Thing that my &s;ecular Obligations and Duties
demanded of me, le&s;s, than if I had been en&s;ured to live
fifty Years more.</HI> This, tho' with infinite Weakne&s;s

<HEAD>THE
CHARACTER
OF
Dr. CHEYNE.</HEAD>
<P>THE extraordinary Circum&s;tances of his Life
in a medical Sen&s;e may be be&s;t collected from
his various Works.&mdash;As a Phy&s;ician he
&s;eemed to proceed, like <HI>Hippocrates</HI> of old
and <HI>Sydennam</HI> of late, upon a few perceptible Truths.
&mdash;He writ chiefly to the Studious, the Voluptu|ous,
and tho&s;e who inherited bad Con&s;titutions from
their Parents, and con&s;equently mu&s;t have been
greatly mi&s;repre&s;ented by tho&s;e who needed not his
Aid, therefore ridicul'd him. A Man, who com|bates
human Plea&s;ures and Pa&s;&s;ions, will never want
Enemies.&mdash;That he might be mi&s;taken in &s;ome
Parts may be readily allowed, but it plainly ap|pears,
that he writ from the full Conviction of his
Heart.&mdash;But to come nearer to the Point, and
within the common Judgment of Mankind, his
<HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> has a peculiar Tendency to promote <HI>Virtue</HI>
and <HI>Religion,</HI> to calm the Pa&s;&s;ions, refine the Mind,
and purify the Heart.</P>
<P>It has been the common, nay a proverbial Phra&s;e,
to charge the Profe&s;&s;ors of Phy&s;ic with Irreligion,
it is hoped, fal&s;ely: However, Dr. <HI>Cheyne</HI> had a
peculiarly &s;incere and vital Warmth for <HI>Chri&s;tianity.</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="13">
He con&s;idered it in the primitive Ages as it was
practi&s;ed, and not in the pre&s;ent as 'tis taught.
He made his Writings all &s;ub&s;ervient to Virtue
and the Glory of God. He lo&s;t not his Creator
in the infinite Works of Creation; he lov'd the
Clergy, and was beloved by them. He died, as
he ever wi&s;h'd and be&s;ought God, calm and with|out
a Pang. His la&s;t Hours were entirely &s;pent
in Prayer, grounded on a full Confidence of <HI>Chri&s;t's</HI>
all-&s;ufficient Merit.</P>

<HEAD>Dr. CHEYNE's
Own ACCOUNT of his
WRITINGS.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t Time I adventured to appear in Print,
was on the Account of my great Ma&s;ter and
generous Friend, Dr. <HI>Pitcairn.</HI> He thought
him&s;elf ill-u&s;ed by &s;ome of his Brethren of the Pro|fe&s;&s;ion
who then were at inte&s;tine War on the Subject
of <HI>Fevers;</HI> and fancied the hand&s;ome&s;t Way to bring
them down, was to exhibit a more &s;pecious Account
of this Di&s;ea&s;e, than any of them had &s;hewn. His
Bu&s;ine&s;s then in the Practice of Phy&s;ick was &s;o great,
as not to allow him &s;ufficient Time for &s;uch a Work.
Two others therefore, with my&s;elf, were joined to
manage the Affair: In which he was to cut and carve,
and to add the practical Part. My Province was the
Theory. I was then very young in the Profe&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="10" REF="14">
and living in the Country. But in a few Days I brought
in my Part fini&s;hed, as it now appears, under the Ti|tle
of <HI>The New Theory of Fevers.</HI> The others either
&s;uppre&s;s'd or forgot theirs; and mine, without the
lea&s;t Alteration, but in a few Words, was order'd for
the Pre&s;s. I could not re&s;i&s;t the Commands of my
Friend; but would not &s;uffer my Name to be put to
it, being con&s;cious it was a raw and unexperienced
Performance. There are tho', &s;ome Things in it,
which may be of U&s;e to Beginners, both as to the
Method of Philo&s;ophi&s;ing on the Animal Oeconomy,
and in the Account of the Manner of the Operation
of the greater Medicines. The Foundations al&s;o and
the Cau&s;es a&s;&s;igned for acute and &s;low Fevers, I &s;till
think &s;olid and ju&s;t, and more particular and limited
than tho&s;e of any other <HI>Theory</HI> yet publi&s;hed. But it
wants &s;o much filing and fini&s;hing, &s;o many Alterati|ons
and Additions, as would co&s;t me more Labour
and Pains than the writing a new <HI>Treati&s;e</HI> on the &s;ame
Subject: So that out of mere Lazine&s;s and Inappe|tency,
I have thrown it by as unripe Fruit, and &s;uf|fered
it to be as if it never had been.</P>
<P>My next Sally was in a Book of ab&s;tracted Geo|metry
and Algebra, entitled, <HI>Methodus Fluxionum in|ver&s;a,</HI>
brought forth in Ambition and bred up in Va|nity.
There are &s;ome Things in it tolerable for the
Time, when the Methods of Quadratures, the Men|&s;uration
of Ratio's, and Transformation of Curves,
into tho&s;e of other Kinds, were not advanced to &s;uch
Heights as they now are. But it is a long Time &s;ince
I was forced to forgoe the&s;e barren and airy Studies
for more &s;ub&s;tantial and commodious Speculations:
Indulging and Rioting in the&s;e &s;o exqui&s;itely bewitch|ing
Contemplations, being only proper for publick
Profe&s;&s;ors, and tho&s;e born to E$$ates, and who
<PB N="11" REF="15">
are under no outward Nece&s;&s;ities. Be&s;ides, to own
a great but grievous Truth, tho' they may quicken
and &s;harpen the Invention, &s;trengthen and extend the
Imagination, improve and refine the reas'ning Facul|ty,
and are of U&s;e both in the nece&s;&s;ary and the lux|urious
Refinement of mechanical Arts; yet having
no Tendency to rectify the Will, &s;weeten the Tem|per,
or mend the Heart, they often leave a Stiffne&s;s,
Po&s;itivene&s;s, and Sufficiency on weak Minds, much
more pernicious to Society, and the Intere&s;ts of the
great End of our Being, than all the Advantages
they bring them can recompence. They are indeed
Edge-Tools, not to be tru&s;ted in the Hands of any,
but tho&s;e who have already acquired an humble Heart,
a lowly Spirit, and a &s;ober and teachable Temper.
For in others they are very apt to beget a &s;ecret and
refined Pride, an over-weening and over-bearing Va|nity
(the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite Temper to the true Go&s;pel-Spirit,
which, without Offence, I may &s;uppo&s;e to be
the be&s;t Di&s;po&s;ition of Mind) that tempts them to
pre&s;ume on a Kind of Omni&s;cience, in Re&s;pect of
their Fellow-Creatures, that have not ri&s;en to their
Elevation; and to &s;et up for an Infallibility, or at
lea&s;t a deci&s;ive Judgment, even in Matters which do
not admit of a <HI>more</HI> or <HI>le&s;s</HI> (their proper Object) of
which Kind what&s;oever relates to the infinite Author
of our Being mo&s;t certainly is. Upon all which Ac|counts,
con&s;cious of my own Weakne&s;s, I have long
&s;ince bid them an Adieu, farther than as they &s;erve
to amu&s;e, or are u&s;eful in the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ities of
Life.</P>
<P>The Defence of that Book again&s;t the learned and
acute Mr. <HI>Abr. de Moivre,</HI> being written in a Spirit
of Levity and Re&s;entment, I mo&s;t &s;incerely retract,
and wi&s;h undone, &s;o far as it is per&s;onal or peevi&s;h,
<PB N="12" REF="16">
and a&s;k him and the World Pardon for it; as I do
for the <HI>Defence</HI> of Dr. <HI>Pitcairn</HI>'s <HI>Di&s;&s;ertations,</HI> and the
<HI>New Theory of Fevers,</HI> again&s;t the late learned and in|genious
Dr. <HI>Oliphant.</HI> I heartily condemn and dete&s;t
all per&s;onal Reflections, all malicious and unmannerly
Turns, and all fal&s;e and unju&s;t Repreientations, as
unbecoming Gentlemen, Scholars, and Chri&s;tians;
and di&s;prove and undo both Performances, as far as
in me lies, in every Thing that does not &s;trictly and
barely relate to the Argument.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Part of the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Principles,</HI> that
of <HI>Natural Religion,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts merely of Di&s;cour&s;es and
Lectures of <HI>Natural Philo&s;ophy,</HI> and of its Con&s;equen|ces
on <HI>Religion,</HI> occa&s;ionally read or di&s;cour&s;ed to that
mo&s;t noble and great Per&s;on, the Duke of <HI>Roxburgh,</HI>
&s;o great an Ornament to his Country, and his high
Employments, to whom they were in&s;crib'd. I thought
they might be of U&s;e to other young Gentlemen,
who, while they were learning the Elements of natu|ral
Philo&s;ophy, might have thereby the Principles of
natural Religon in&s;en&s;ibly in&s;tilled into them. And
accordingly it has been and &s;till is u&s;ed for that Purpo&s;e
at both Univer&s;ities.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Part of the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Principles,</HI> to
wit, that of <HI>Revealed Religion,</HI> was added afterward,
to &s;hew, that all our Knowledge of Nature was by
Analogy, or the Relations of Things only, and not
their real Nature, Sub&s;tance, or internal Principles:
That from this Method of Analogy (the only Medi|um
of human Knowledge) we &s;hould be nece&s;&s;arily
led to conclude the Attributes or Qualities of the
&s;upreme and ab&s;olute Infinite, were indeed analo|gous
to the Properties or Qualities of finite Beings,
but only in &s;uch a Manner as the Difference bet|ween
<PB N="13" REF="17">
Infinite and Finite requires; and that there|fore,
not being able to know preci&s;ely the&s;e Diffe|rences,
we ought implicitely to believe without rea|&s;oning,
what is revealed to us concerning the Na|ture
of the infinite Being; or bring our Rea&s;on to
&s;ubmit to the My&s;teries of Faith. How I have &s;uc|ceeded
is not for me to determine. As the End
was hone&s;t, I am &s;ecure the great Principles and
the fundamental Propo&s;itions are true and ju&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>E&s;&s;ay on the Gout and</HI> Bath <HI>Waters</HI> was brought
forth by mere Accident. The fir&s;t Draught being, as I
there mentioned, only a Paper of Directions for a
Gentleman, my Friend and Patient, troubled with
the Gout. It was enlarged upon different Occa&s;ions,
and publi&s;hed to prevent its being pyrated; &s;everal Co|pies
having been given out to others in the &s;ame Cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P>As to my <HI>E&s;&s;ay of Health and Long Life,</HI> its Ori|gin
was as ca&s;ual as that of my former. My good and
worthy Friend, Sir <HI>Jo&s;eph Jekyl,</HI> having been at <HI>Bath</HI>
for a Confirmation of his Health, at his Departure
de&s;ired me to draw up &s;ome In&s;tructions in Writing
to direct him in the Conduct of his Health for the
future, and in the Manner of &s;upporting his Spirits
free and full, under the great Bu&s;ine&s;s he was engag'd
in. I was then in the Hurry of our Sea&s;on, and could
not &s;o &s;oon an&s;wer his Expectation, as his real Worth,
and my &s;incere E&s;teem required. I thought my&s;elf
therefore the more obliged, as &s;oon as I had Lei&s;ure,
to exert my&s;elf to the uttermo&s;t in Obedience to his
Commands. At fir&s;t I drew up mo&s;t of the&s;e Rules
at the End of the &s;everal Chapters; but, upon Re|flection,
thought it not Re&s;pect enough to his good
Ta&s;te and Capacity to judge of the Rea&s;ons of Things,
<PB N="14" REF="18">
to pre&s;cribe him bare and dry Directions in Matters of &s;o
great Moment. I added therefore the philo&s;ophical
Account and Rea&s;ons of the&s;e Rules, which make up the
Bulk of the Chapters them&s;elves. He, out of Love to
his Fellow-Citizens (which was one &s;hining Part of his
Character, and which I ought to &s;uppo&s;e had in this
In&s;tance only impo&s;ed on his better Judgment) de|&s;ired
they might be made publick. Upon which Ac|count
&s;everal Things have been &s;ince added, to make
the whole of more general U&s;e. If therefore any
Thing in this Treati&s;e be tolerable, or if any Per&s;on
receive Benefit by it, they owe it entirely to that ex|cellent
Per&s;on, upon who&s;e Account &s;olely it was un|dertaken,
and at who&s;e Reque&s;t it is publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>I know not what may be the Fate and Succe&s;s of
this Performance; nor am I &s;ollicitous about it, being
con&s;cious the De&s;ign was hone&s;t, the Subject weighty,
and the Execution the be&s;t my Time, my Abilities,
and my Health would permit, which cannot bear the
Labour of much Fileing and Fini&s;hing. Being careful
not to incroach on the Province of the Phy&s;ician, I
have concealed nothing my Knowledge could &s;ugge&s;t to
direct the Sufferer, in the be&s;t Manner I could, to pre|&s;erve
his Health, and lengthen out his Life: And I have
held out no fal&s;e or delu&s;ory Lights to lead him a&s;tray,
or torment him unnece&s;&s;arily.</P>
<P>If it were po&s;&s;ible any Set of Men could be offend|ed
at my Performance, it might be my Brethren of
the Profe&s;&s;ion, for endeavouring to le&s;&s;en the <HI>Materia
Morbifica.</HI> But as this would be the mo&s;t malicious,
unju&s;t, and unworthy Reflection could be thrown on
Scholars and Gentlemen of a liberal Education; &s;o I
never entertain'd the mo&s;t remote Vanity to think a|ny
Endeavour of mine would make &s;o con&s;iderable a
<PB N="15" REF="19">
Change in the Nation; e&s;pecially when the Devil, the
World, and the Fle&s;h were on the other Side of the
Que&s;tion, which have &s;tood their Ground even again&s;t
the Rules of Life and Immortality brought to Light
by the <HI>Go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P>All I can &s;ay as an Apology is, that of what&s;oever
Indifference my Concerns as an Author may be to my
Reader, yet they were not &s;o to me; this being the
only Place and Time I may have to adju&s;t them in,
and it being the Heighth of my Ambition,</P>

<P><HI>THE Title</HI> I have cho&s;en for this <HI>Treati&s;e,</HI> is a <HI>Re|proach</HI>
univer&s;ally thrown on this <HI>I&s;land</HI> by Fo|reigners,
and all our Neighbours on the <HI>Continent,</HI> by
whom <HI>nervous</HI> Di&s;tempers, <HI>Spleen, Vapours,</HI> and <HI>Low|ne&s;s
of Spirits,</HI> are in Deri&s;ion, called the ENGLISH
MALADY. And I wi&s;h there were not &s;o good
Grounds for this Reflection. The <HI>Moi&s;ture</HI> of our <HI>Air,</HI>
the Variablene&s;s of our <HI>Weather,</HI> (from our Situation
amid&s;t the <HI>Ocean</HI>) the <HI>Rankne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Fertility</HI> of our
Soil, the <HI>Richne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Heavine&s;s</HI> of our Food, the
<HI>Wealth</HI> and <HI>Abundance</HI> of the Inhabitants, (from
their univer&s;al Trade) the <HI>Inactivity</HI> and <HI>&s;edentary</HI>
Occupations of the better Sort, (among whom
<PB N="16" REF="20">
this <HI>Evil</HI> mo&s;tly rages) and the Humour of living in
great, populous, and con&s;equently unhealthy Towns,
have brought forth a <HI>Cla&s;s</HI> and <HI>Set</HI> of Di&s;tempers, with
atrocious and frightful <HI>Symptoms,</HI> &s;carce known to our
Ance&s;tors, and never ri&s;ing to &s;uch fatal <HI>Heights,</HI> nor
afflicting &s;uch <HI>Numbers</HI> in any other known Nation.
The&s;e <HI>nervous</HI> Di&s;orders being computed to make al|mo&s;t
one <HI>Third</HI> of the Complaints of the People of
<HI>Condition</HI> in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Work</HI> has lain fini&s;h'd by me, as it now ap|pears
(at lea&s;t in the main) the&s;e &s;everal Years pa&s;t,
and was intended as a <HI>Legacy</HI> and <HI>Dying-Speech,</HI> only
to my <HI>Fellow-Sufferers</HI> under the&s;e Complaints. And
had certainly never appear'd, (till its Author had di&s;|appear'd)
had it not been for the perhaps indi&s;creet
<HI>Zeal</HI> of &s;ome of my warme&s;t Friends, who (upon the
late Frequency and daily Encrea&s;e of wanton and un|common
Self murderers, produc'd mo&s;tly by this <HI>Di|&s;temper,</HI>
and their <HI>bla&s;phemous</HI> and <HI>frantick Apologies</HI>
grafted on the Principles of the <HI>Infidels,</HI> and propa|gated
by their <HI>Di&s;ciples</HI>) extorted it from me, to try
what a little more ju&s;t and &s;olid <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> join'd to
a Method of <HI>Cure,</HI> and proper Medicines could do,
to put a Stop to &s;o univer&s;al a <HI>Lunacy</HI> and <HI>Madne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>What I pretend to have done in &s;ome Degree in
the following Treati&s;e, is, That I hope I have ex|plain'd
the Nature and Cau&s;es of <HI>Nervous Di&s;tempers</HI>
(which have hitherto been reckon'd <HI>Witchcraft, En|chantment,
Sorcery</HI> and <HI>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,</HI> and have been the
con&s;tant Re&s;ource of Ignorance) from Principles ea|&s;y,
natural and intelligible, deduc'd from the be&s;t and
&s;ounde&s;t <HI>Natural Philo&s;ophy;</HI> and have by the plaine&s;t
Rea&s;oning, drawn from the&s;e <HI>Cau&s;es</HI> and this <HI>Philo&s;o|phy,</HI>
a <HI>Method of Cure</HI> and a <HI>Cour&s;e of Medicines</HI> &s;pe|ci&s;ically
<PB N="17" REF="21">
obviating the&s;e Cau&s;es, confirm'd by long Ex|perience
and repeated Ob&s;ervations, and conformable
to the Practice of the able&s;t and be&s;t Writers on the&s;e
Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>There are two Sorts of Readers I have not the mo&s;t
remote Hopes of convincing or giving Satisfaction to;

begin to feel violent <HI>Pain,</HI> long <HI>Sickne&s;s,</HI> habitual <HI>Low
Spirits,</HI> or enter upon the <HI>Limits of both Worlds,</HI> they
may be convinced. For, in the main, I believe the
Cau&s;e of the&s;e Di&s;tempers here a&s;&s;ign'd, <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>ade|quate,</HI>
and on the Succe&s;s of the <HI>Methods of Cure</HI> laid

<HEAD>II. An E&s;&s;ay on Regimen. Together with Five

<P>THE following <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> was written to in&s;truct all

their Di&s;tempers, the <HI>Time</HI> of Life, the <HI>Nature</HI> of

the &s;ame Degrees of <HI>Light</HI> not being equally <HI>lu|minous</HI>

and Valetudinarians e&s;pecially, become, as it were,
<HI>Children</HI> a &s;econd Time, and, in their <HI>&s;econd Childhood,
tho&s;e</HI> mu&s;t have their <HI>Rattles</HI> as well as <HI>the&s;e;</HI> I thought
it &s;afer, as I am &s;ure it is much more entertaining, to
play with <HI>Ideas, philo&s;ophic Conjectures,</HI> and &s;uch <HI>A|mu&s;ements,</HI>
how weakly &s;oever founded, as tend to
make <HI>Virtue</HI> and its <HI>Sour&s;e</HI> amiable, ju&s;tify the <HI>Conduct
of Providence,</HI> and mend and rejoice the <HI>Heart</HI> with|out
hurting the <HI>Head,</HI> than to dwell on the dark Side
of Things, that lead to <HI>Pyrrhoni&s;m, Fatali&s;m, Infide|lity,</HI>
and <HI>De&s;pair.</HI> If I thought I had advanced any
thing <HI>derogatory</HI> from the <HI>Amiablene&s;s</HI> of infinit Per|fection,
<HI>contrary</HI> to the Doctrine of the earlie&s;t and
pure&s;t Times of <HI>Chri&s;tianity, contradictory</HI> to the <HI>Ana|logy</HI>
of Faith, and the <HI>Form of &s;ound Words,</HI> I had
<PB N="20" REF="24">
committed the&s;e <HI>Sheets</HI> to the <HI>Flames,</HI> with the <HI>Hand</HI>
of their <HI>Author,</HI> before I had publi&s;hed them. But,
on the contrary, I hoped they might agreeably enter|tain

the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ages</HI> from <HI>this</HI> to <HI>that Man&s;ion;</HI> by endeavour|ing
to <HI>illu&s;trat,</HI> from not &s;o common a Set of <HI>Princi|ples</HI>

no Po&s;&s;ibility of Happine&s;s here or hereafter, without
<HI>Purity</HI> of <HI>Heart</HI> and <HI>Life;</HI> and that the true <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> of
the pre&s;ent <HI>Darkne&s;s,</HI> both in <HI>Providence</HI> and <HI>Revelati|on,</HI>
is the Difficulty of recovering this <HI>Purity of Heart

con&s;i&s;tent with their <HI>Liberty,</HI> and the <HI>Har|mony</HI>
of the Divine Attributes, which infinit <HI>Power</HI>
and <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> will not, I might &s;ay, cannot, counteract.</P>
<P>I apprehend le&s;s Quarter from the oppo&s;it <HI>Set</HI> of
Men, who may honour me with <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m, Roman|ceing,</HI>
and <HI>Ca&s;tle-building,</HI> without any &s;olid Foundati|on.
All I have to &s;ay is, that perhaps my Manner of
explaining &s;ome great Truths, and a few of the Con|&s;equences
I draw by my <HI>Method,</HI> may be defective:
And perhaps, from &s;ome of the <HI>Links</HI> being dropt,
and from Faults in the <HI>wording,</HI> the <HI>Chain</HI> of the Rea|&s;oning
may not be always <HI>clear</HI> and <HI>&s;trong;</HI> but I am
&s;ure the <HI>Foundation</HI> is <HI>&s;olid</HI> and <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> and allowed to be

Perhaps the <HI>Method,</HI> when manag'd by a <HI>clearer Head,</HI>

of <HI>divine Knowledge,</HI> and a <HI>&s;ublime Philo&s;ophy. Mathe|matitians</HI>

<P>I take <HI>common Happine&s;s,</HI> in our natural State at pre|&s;ent,

will pre&s;erve all the Opulent healthy from every mor|tal

Aphori&s;ms, <HI>which we &s;hall here beg Leave to tran&s;|cribe,
for the Benefit of tho&s;e who may have not yet &s;een
that Book, and as a</HI> Specimen <HI>of the whole.</HI> viz.</P>
<P>I. A Con&s;tant Endeavour after the <HI>lighte&s;t</HI> and
the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> of Meat and Drink a Man can be
tolerably ea&s;y under, is the <HI>&s;horte&s;t</HI> and mo&s;t infallible
<HI>Mean</HI> to pre&s;erve <HI>Life, Health,</HI> and <HI>Serenity.</HI></P>
<P>II. He that would pre&s;erve a <HI>clear Head,</HI> and equal
Spirits, mu&s;t keep his <HI>Stomach</HI> clean, his <HI>Bowels</HI> mo|deratly
empty and uncompre&s;t.</P>
<P>III. On <HI>bad Nights, Lowne&s;s, Flatulence</HI> and Op|pre&s;&s;ion
of <HI>Spirits,</HI> of any Continuance, the only cer|tain
<HI>Reliefs</HI> are, a &s;mall <HI>Phlebotomy,</HI> a gentle <HI>Vomit,</HI> a
<HI>dome&s;tic Purge, rideing</HI> a Hor&s;e-back, and a <HI>Regimen</HI> of
the <HI>lighte&s;t</HI> and the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> per&s;i&s;ted in.</P>
<P>IV. Small frequent <HI>Phlebotomies</HI> are the quicke&s;t and
mo&s;t effectual Mean to mend the <HI>Blood,</HI> and to cure
<HI>Cachochymy,</HI> if a <HI>Regimen</HI> of the lighte&s;t and lea&s;t be
joined.</P>
<P>V. Gentle and repeated Evacuation upwards and
downwards, (e&s;pecially, and perhaps only, <HI>Vomits</HI>) by
<PB N="26" REF="30">
the Medicines mo&s;t familiar and experienced, (the
<HI>Action</HI> and Exerci&s;e of Vomiting is its chief U&s;e) are
the <HI>&s;ure&s;t, quicke&s;t,</HI> and mo&s;t effectual Mean to prevent
or remedy the ill Effects of Gluttony, Over-loading,
and Repletion, (that is, almo&s;t all chronical Di&s;tem|pers)
provided the <HI>lighte&s;t</HI> and the lea&s;t be join'd
afterwards.</P>
<P>VI. <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es</HI> are always to be cured by their <HI>Con|traries,</HI>
the <HI>high Diet</HI> by the <HI>low,</HI> the <HI>hot</HI> by the <HI>cool,</HI>
the <HI>&s;apid</HI> by the <HI>in&s;ipid,</HI> the <HI>thiek</HI> and gro&s;s by the <HI>thin</HI>
and poor, <HI>Repletion</HI> by <HI>Fa&s;ting, Inactivity</HI> by <HI>Exerci&s;e.</HI>
Health acquir'd and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed lies in the middle Re|gimen,
between the&s;e two <HI>Extremes.</HI></P>
<P>VII. <HI>Perfect Health</HI> and <HI>good Spirits</HI> depend chiefly,
if not only, on the ea&s;y and plea&s;ant Play or Perfor|mance
of the <HI>Animal Functions, viz.</HI> the <HI>Dige&s;tion, Cir|culation,
Re&s;piration, Per&s;piration, mu&s;cular Motion,</HI>
and the <HI>Secretions.</HI></P>
<P>VIII. He that would be &s;oon <HI>well,</HI> mu&s;t be long <HI>&s;ick,</HI>
that is, treat him&s;elf as a <HI>Valetudinarian</HI> in mo&s;t things.</P>
<P>IX. <HI>Exerci&s;e</HI> and <HI>gentle Evacuation</HI> will &s;upply the
Place of <HI>Ab&s;tinence,</HI> and <HI>Ab&s;tinence</HI> will &s;upply the
Place of <HI>Evacuation;</HI> but the fir&s;t two are &s;till prefera|ble,
becau&s;e they damage the <HI>Solids</HI> lea&s;t.</P>
<P>X. <HI>Quantity</HI> in Food will &s;upply <HI>Quality,</HI> and <HI>Qua|lity</HI>
will &s;upply the Place of <HI>Quantity;</HI> but in very bad
Ca&s;es it is mo&s;t &s;ecure to join <HI>both.</HI></P>
<P>XI. There is but little in a <HI>&s;pecifick Regimen</HI> of <HI>Di|et</HI>
to remedy or antidot a <HI>&s;pecifick Di&s;temper; Ab&s;tinence</HI>
in general, or a con&s;tant Endeavour after the <HI>lighte&s;t</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="31">
and the <HI>lea&s;t,</HI> will con&s;tantly &s;upply the Place of any
<HI>&s;pecific</HI> particular <HI>Regimen</HI> of Diet: But in very bad
Ca&s;es, a particular <HI>Choice</HI> of the mo&s;t <HI>&s;pecific Regimen</HI>
that <HI>Art, Experience</HI> and <HI>Philo&s;ophy</HI> &s;hew to be mo&s;t
proper, is not to be neglected.</P>
<P>XII. The <HI>Regimen of Diet</HI> by which one is cured
of a particular Di&s;temper, ought to be continued, at
lea&s;t in &s;ome Degree, e&s;pecially if the Per&s;on is not
much under <HI>Fifty,</HI> el&s;e the Di&s;temper will return with
more &s;evere and wor&s;e <HI>Symptoms</HI> than at fir&s;t, as <HI>Ex|perience</HI>
has con&s;tantly &s;hew'd.</P>
<P>XIII. Every <HI>wi&s;e</HI> Man, after <HI>Fifty,</HI> ought to begin
to le&s;&s;en at lea&s;t the <HI>Quantity</HI> of his <HI>Aliment;</HI> and if he
would continue free of great and dangerous Di&s;temp|ers,
and pre&s;erve his <HI>Sen&s;es</HI> and <HI>Faculties</HI> clear to the
<HI>la&s;t,</HI> he ought every &s;even Year go on, abateing gra|dually
and &s;en&s;ibly, and at la&s;t <HI>de&s;cend</HI> out of Life as
he <HI>a&s;cended</HI> into it, even into the Child's Diet.</P>
<P>XIV. He that is <HI>old</HI> when he is young, that is,
treats him&s;elf as a wi&s;e <HI>old Man</HI> does, or ought to do,
by great <HI>Temperance, Air</HI> and <HI>Exerci&s;e,</HI> if he lives pa&s;t
Thirty-five, will be young when he grows old in Years.</P>
<P>XV. No Per&s;on of any Fortune ever died, or &s;uf|fer'd
<HI>acute</HI> Pains, or mortal Di&s;tempers, by the <HI>too
cool, too little,</HI> or too <HI>in&s;ipid</HI> in Diet; all by the <HI>too hot,
high</HI> and <HI>&s;avoury:</HI> But Virtue and Health lie in the
<HI>golden Mean,</HI> &s;o difficult to be found, and only to be
&s;ecur'd by the <HI>lighte&s;t</HI> and the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> a Man can be tole|rably
ea&s;y under.</P>
<P>XVI. The eternal <HI>Law</HI> of Nature, by inten&s;e Pai$
in <HI>Craveing</HI> and <HI>Hunger,</HI> will never &s;uffer a Per&s;on in
<PB N="28" REF="32">
his right Sen&s;es to go on long ob&s;tinatly, and to his
Hurt, in the <HI>too little.</HI></P>
<P>XVII. <HI>Water pure, clear and in&s;ipid,</HI> is the &s;ole <HI>Be|verage</HI>
that can procure or continue <HI>Health,</HI> and a <HI>clear
Head,</HI> being the <HI>&s;ole</HI> Fluid that will pa&s;s through the
&s;malle&s;t animal <HI>Tubes</HI> without Re&s;i&s;tance; next to it
are <HI>aqueous,</HI> or weak fermented Liquors.</P>
<P>XVIII. <HI>Water tepid or cold,</HI> or impregnated with
the <HI>&s;pecific Vegetables,</HI> or <HI>Minerals,</HI> that Experience
has found proper to <HI>antidot</HI> a given Di&s;temper, is the
true <HI>Panacea</HI> in both <HI>acute</HI> and <HI>chronical Di&s;tempers:</HI>
Nature has prepared no other <HI>Medicin</HI> for us, but Wa|ter
impregnated with <HI>Vegetables</HI> in their <HI>Juices,</HI> or na|tural
<HI>Mineral</HI> Waters on the Surface of the Earth.</P>
<P>XIX. <HI>Milk</HI> is the only <HI>Food</HI> prepared by Nature
for young, that is, weak and tender <HI>animal</HI> Bodies;
and there is no real Difference between a <HI>young, tender,
animal Body,</HI> and a di&s;ea&s;ed grown <HI>Animal,</HI> but that,
of the <HI>two,</HI> the <HI>la&s;t</HI> is the wor&s;t; but it will co&s;t La|bour
and Patience to make <HI>Milk</HI> agree in <HI>bilious</HI> Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>XX. <HI>Milk</HI> and &s;weet &s;ound Blood differ in nothing
but in <HI>Colour: Milk</HI> is <HI>Blood,</HI> which almo&s;t directly
comes from the Chyle into the Teats of the <HI>Animal;</HI>
and <HI>Blood</HI> is <HI>Milk</HI> which has gone many Rounds in the
<HI>Circulation,</HI> and is ground a little in the <HI>Lungs,</HI> where
being mixt with the <HI>Nitre</HI> of the Air, it receives its
<HI>Scarlet</HI> Colour; it is a Medium between <HI>animal</HI> and
<HI>vegetable</HI> Food.</P>
<P>XXI. <HI>Whey</HI> &s;weet, or medicated with the Juice of
any <HI>&s;pecific</HI> Plant, Sage, Balm, or Orange, or anti|&s;corbutic,
vulnerary, or pulmonic Plants, will &s;upply
<PB N="29" REF="33">
the Place, and are preferable to mo&s;t Decoctions, of
Plants, Infu&s;ions, <HI>Apozems</HI> and <HI>Diet-Drinks</HI> what&s;o|ever,
except tho&s;e of the &s;trong Detergents, as <HI>Hor&s;e-Radi&s;h,
Mu&s;tard-Seed,</HI> and the like, where nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>XXII. <HI>Goats Whey</HI> being a natural Infu&s;ion from
gentle Heat, and gentle <HI>Triture,</HI> of the fine <HI>aromatic</HI>
and <HI>nitrous</HI> Vegetables on which <HI>Goats</HI> feed only, is
one of the very be&s;t Diluents, Detergents, Clean&s;ers
and Sweetners of <HI>&s;corbutic</HI> and <HI>&s;alin Cachochymies.</HI></P>
<P>XXIII. <HI>Friction</HI> Morning and Night, and in Win|ter
Wa&s;hing with warm, and Drying before a Fire,
and in Summer with cold Water, is an excellent <HI>Mean</HI>
to facilitat and promote the Per&s;piration; to clean the
<HI>Cuticle,</HI> and cure <HI>cutaneous</HI> Uncleanne&s;s and <HI>Defedati|ons,
cold Batheing</HI> is excellent, and preferable to every
Wa&s;hing in Ca&s;es where the Blood is &s;weet and thin,
the Solids too lax only.</P>
<P>XXIV. <HI>Cincture</HI> with a broad quilted Belt about
the Loins, to keep the <HI>Bowels</HI> in their natural Situati|ons,
and the <HI>chylous Ve&s;&s;els</HI> in their be&s;t <HI>Locality,</HI> and
in flabby Con&s;titutions, weak <HI>Bowels</HI> and <HI>Atrophies,</HI>
is of great Benefit.</P>
<P>XXV. <HI>Rideing</HI> is the be&s;t of all Exerci&s;es to get
Health, and to promote the <HI>Dige&s;tions,</HI> e&s;pecially in
<HI>nervous Di&s;tempers,</HI> where the <HI>Abdomen</HI> and the <HI>Me&s;e|raic
Glands</HI> are principally affected: But <HI>Walking</HI> is be&s;t
to pre&s;erve Health already got, becau&s;e it is the mo&s;t
natural, and the mo&s;t univer&s;al Promoter of all the
Excretions.</P>
<P>XXVI. In <HI>Nature</HI> or <HI>Art</HI> there is no &s;uch immedi|at
Cure for low Spirits, Anxiety, and Want of Sleep,
<PB N="30" REF="34">
as rideing a Hor&s;e-back, long Journies with Fa&s;ting,
or rather a very &s;oft light Feeding with warm thin
Liquors at Re&s;ting-Places, but that the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible
that actual <HI>Fainting</HI> will permit.</P>
<P>XXVII. Next to <HI>Rideing,</HI> is either a <HI>Vomit,</HI> or Fa&s;t|ing
almo&s;t to Faintne&s;s, and then only a little &s;piced
Wine and Water warm, and a Mouthful or two of
<HI>dry Bi&s;ket</HI> every 5th or 6th Hour, with continued <HI>Fri|ction,</HI>
with a cour&s;e Cloth, warm Flannel, or a Fle&s;h-Bru&s;h,
e&s;pecially on the <HI>Spine,</HI> in <HI>Faintings</HI> and ex|treme
<HI>Lowne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>XXVIII. To procure <HI>natural Re&s;t,</HI> nothing is like
four or five middling Pills of true <HI>A&s;&s;afoetida,</HI> with
four or five Grains of pure &s;uccatrine Aloe, taken
going to Bed.</P>
<P>XXIX. The only Way to &s;ecure tolerable <HI>Spirits</HI>
in very low Ca&s;es, is a con&s;tant Endeavour to make
Hunger the greate&s;t Pain, and to cheat the <HI>Appetite</HI>
and Craveing with little, warm, light Liquors at
large Intervals.</P>
<P>XXX. <HI>Good Hours</HI> will be always a mo&s;t beneficial
Mean to pre&s;erve Health and Spirits, to go to Bed
by Ten, and ri&s;e by Six.</P>
<P>XXXI. Who&s;oever would pre&s;erve his Health
and Spirits to the la&s;t, even when he is in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of it, ought to pa&s;s through the great Operations of
<HI>Phy&s;ic</HI> in the <HI>Spring, viz.</HI> To <HI>bleed, vomit</HI> and <HI>purge,</HI>
whether he have apparent Nece&s;&s;ity or not; for <HI>Scur|vy,</HI>
or <HI>&s;corbutic Juices,</HI> is the great chronical and fun|damental
Di&s;temper of <HI>Britain;</HI> all the re&s;t are but
Sprouts and Branches of it. And therefore,</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="35">
XXXII. <HI>Vomits</HI> often repeated, at lea&s;t as often as
the Symptom of any Ail aggravats, increa&s;es or ex|a&s;perats,
are the &s;ole <HI>univer&s;al Antidote</HI> and <HI>Panacea</HI> of
<HI>Britain;</HI> an ailing Per&s;on cannot repeat <HI>them</HI> too of|ten,
they will always prove beneficial and <HI>&s;alutary.</HI></P>
<P>XXXIII. In <HI>cold Feet</HI> nothing like batheing them
in tepid Water a little before going to Bed.</P>
<P>XXXIV. A <HI>low Diet</HI> &s;eldom extirpats, or totally
cradicats, any <HI>hereditary chronical</HI> Di&s;temper, unle&s;s it
be in the young, the middling aged, or the &s;trong
and healthy, who have otherwi&s;e tolerable <HI>Stamina;</HI>
in the very <HI>puny,</HI> delicat and <HI>&s;lender,</HI> in the <HI>old,</HI> and
far advanced in Life, even after Fifty, in the &s;trong|e&s;t,
it only abates the Violence of their <HI>Symptoms,</HI>
makes them le&s;s &s;evere, and the Returns &s;eldomer,
and only prolongs the Duration of their Lives.</P>
<P>XXXV. The natural Di&s;ea&s;es of the <HI>Poor</HI> and <HI>Ne|ce&s;&s;itous</HI>
are generally owing to a <HI>bad,</HI> unwhole&s;ome,
un&s;ound Diet, and the Want of due Care of the o|ther
<HI>Non-naturals,</HI> Cleanne&s;s and Shelter; and are
generally cured by their <HI>Contraries, viz.</HI> a good,
<HI>whole&s;ome,</HI> plain Diet, and a due Cleanne&s;s, Shelter
from the Inclemency of Sea&s;ons, and an ea&s;y Mind.</P>
<P>XXXVI. If it happen that the <HI>Poor,</HI> and tho&s;e ha|ving
no Property of their <HI>own,</HI> by <HI>Stealth, Robbery,</HI>
or <HI>unlawful</HI> Means, enter on and pur&s;ue the <HI>Luxury</HI>
of the <HI>Rich</HI> and Opulent, not having the other Ne+ce&s;&s;aries
and Conveniences of Life, neglecting, or not
being able to afford, or being inured to want the ne|ce&s;&s;ary
Care of the other <HI>Non-naturals,</HI> their Di&s;ea&s;es
are then the mo&s;t <HI>atrocious,</HI> painful and mi&s;erable of
<PB N="32" REF="36">
any; which is the Rea&s;on that the <HI>acute</HI> and <HI>contagi|ous</HI>
Di&s;tempers begin fir&s;t, &s;pread fa&s;ter, and are more
<HI>mortal</HI> among <HI>them,</HI> than tho&s;e of the better Sort.</P>
<P>XXXVII. <HI>Diet;</HI> a proper well regulated and par|&s;imonious,
cool Diet, is the far greate&s;t <HI>Article</HI> of long
Life and Health; but the other <HI>Non-naturals</HI> are to be
carefully attended to, and guarded again&s;t, el&s;e it will
not avail alone, which is the Ca&s;e in <HI>Mona&s;teries, De|&s;arts,</HI>
and long <HI>Sea Voyages.</HI></P>
<P>N. B. <HI>Before we come to give an</HI> Account <HI>of the
la&s;t</HI> Article <HI>of Dr.</HI> CHEYNE'<HI>s</HI> Writings, <HI>we
thought it not improper to &s;ubjoin to the foregoing</HI> Apho|ri&s;ms,
<HI>His</HI> Method <HI>of</HI> curing <HI>a</HI> COLD, <HI>taken from
his</HI> E&s;&s;ay on Health and Long Life; <HI>where (in</HI> Pages
29 <HI>and</HI> 30 <HI>of the 8th</HI> Edition <HI>of that</HI> Book) <HI>he &s;ays,</HI></P>
<P>THAT Dr. <HI>James Keill,</HI> in his <HI>Statica Britannica,</HI>
has made it out, beyond all Po&s;&s;ibility of doubt|ing,
that <HI>catching of Cold,</HI> is nothing but <HI>&s;ucking</HI> in,
by the Pa&s;&s;ages of <HI>Per&s;piration,</HI> large <HI>Quantities</HI> of
<HI>moi&s;t Air,</HI> and <HI>Nitrous Salts,</HI> which, by the thicken|ing
the Blood and Juices, (as is evident from Bleed|ing
after catching Cold) and thereby <HI>ob&s;tructing,</HI> not
only the <HI>Per&s;piration,</HI> but al&s;o all the other &s;iner <HI>Se|cretions,</HI>
rai&s;es immediately a &s;mall <HI>Fever</HI> and a <HI>Tu|mult</HI>
in the whole <HI>Animal Oeconomy:</HI> and, neglected,
lays a Foundation for <HI>Con&s;umptions, Ob&s;tructions</HI> of the
great <HI>Vi&s;cera,</HI> and univer&s;al <HI>Cachexies.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Tender</HI> therefore, and <HI>Valetudinary,</HI> ought cau|tiou&s;ly
to avoid all Occa&s;ions of <HI>catching Cold;</HI> and if
they have been &s;o unfortunate as to <HI>get one,</HI> to &s;et a|bout
its Cure immediately, before it has taken too
deep <HI>Root</HI> in the <HI>Habit.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="37">
From the <HI>Nature</HI> of the Di&s;order thus de&s;crib'd,
the <HI>Remedy</HI> is obvious; to wit, <HI>lying</HI> much <HI>a Bed;
drinking</HI> plentifully of &s;mall, warm <HI>Sack-Whey,</HI> with
a few <HI>Drops</HI> of <HI>Spirits</HI> of <HI>Hart's Horn; Po&s;&s;et-Drink;
Water-Gruel,</HI> or any other <HI>warm, &s;mall Liquor;</HI> a Scru|ple
of <HI>Ga&s;$$igne</HI>'s <HI>Powder,</HI> Morning and Night, living
<HI>low</HI> upon <HI>Spoon-Meats, Pudding,</HI> and <HI>Chicken,</HI> and <HI>drink|ing</HI>
every Thing <HI>warm:</HI> In a Word, treating it at fir&s;t
as a &s;mall <HI>Fever,</HI> with gentle <HI>Diaphoreticks;</HI> and after|wards,
if any <HI>Cough</HI> or <HI>Spitting</HI> &s;hould remain, (which
this Method generally prevents) by <HI>&s;oftening</HI> the <HI>Brea&s;t</HI>

<HEAD>III. The Natural Method of Curing the Di&s;ea&s;es
of the Body, and the Di&s;orders of the Mind
depending on the Body. In Three Parts.</HEAD>
<P>IN my <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> on <HI>Regimen,</HI> I promi&s;ed the World
my Thoughts concerning, <HI>The natural Method of
cureing the Di&s;ea&s;es of the Body, and the Di&s;orders of
the Mind re&s;ulting from &s;uch Di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> on the Principles
of <HI>Philo&s;ophy</HI> laid down in that <HI>E&s;&s;ay,</HI> which, by a
Cour&s;e of fifty Years Study, I have di&s;cover'd to be
the mo&s;t <HI>Rational,</HI> and in forty Years <HI>Practice</HI> of <HI>Phy|&s;ic,</HI>
have found them to be the mo&s;t <HI>Effectual.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="38">
This <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> I have in the <HI>following Sheets</HI> endea|vour'd
to perform, whether to the <HI>Satisfaction</HI> and <HI>Be|nefit</HI>
of the <HI>Public, Time</HI> and <HI>Experience</HI> mu&s;t &s;hew.
To a <HI>Delicacy</HI> of <HI>Sentiment</HI> and <HI>Correctne&s;s</HI> of <HI>Style,</HI> I
have &s;mall Preten&s;ions; to convey my own <HI>Thoughts</HI>
to others, with as much <HI>Plainne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Per&s;picuity</HI> as
my Subject would admit of, has been my <HI>principal
View;</HI> and if the &s;erious attentive <HI>Reader</HI> finds him|&s;elf
in&s;tructed, the Intention of the Writer is an&s;wer'd,
and his Credit, as a <HI>Pen-man,</HI> is of &s;mall Import.</P>
<P><HI>Nature</HI> and her <HI>Laws,</HI> a competent Knowledge of
the <HI>animal Oeconomy,</HI> and the be&s;t <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> which
I have been capable of makeing on my own <HI>Succe&s;s</HI>
in Practice, or on that of the able&s;t of my <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion,</HI>
are the Foundation of every thing by me advanced.
<HI>Theory</HI> I have given into as far only as &s;eemed nece&s;&s;a|ry
to reconcile the <HI>Method</HI> and <HI>Medicins</HI> by me recom|mended,
to the true&s;t <HI>Idea</HI> which I could frame of
the Di&s;temper to be cured: For the re&s;t, the <HI>Reader</HI>
is referred to the <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> above-mentiond, and its <HI>Ap|pendages.</HI></P>
<P>In a De&s;ign exten&s;ive as this, it will not be expect|ed
that I &s;hould de&s;cend either into <HI>Forms</HI> of <HI>Medi|cins,</HI>
or the particular Circum&s;tances of every <HI>Di&s;tem|per</HI>
under Con&s;ideration; this will be the nece&s;&s;ary
Duty of the <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI> in ordinary, who, if he ap|proves
the general Directions by me given, will readi|ly
adapt them to any particular Ca&s;e, its <HI>Degrees</HI> and
<HI>Symptoms.</HI></P>
<P>It cannot, I &s;hould hope, give any rea&s;onable <HI>Of|fence,</HI>
if in a Work of this Kind, many particular
Things &s;hould occur, which probably I may have al|ready
<PB N="35" REF="39">
advanced in &s;ome former <HI>Treati&s;es;</HI> my <HI>Apology</HI>
for which is, that in all I know of <HI>Phy&s;ic,</HI> I have but
one general <HI>Sy&s;tem; Nature</HI> being ever <HI>one</HI> and the
&s;ame, and proceeding in all <HI>animal Functions</HI> and Ope|rations
by the <HI>&s;ame,</HI> or at lea&s;t by analogous <HI>Laws.</HI></P>
<P>What I learned from <HI>Books, Speculation</HI> and <HI>Philo|&s;ophy,</HI>
by Trial and Experience I have found to be
greatly <HI>defective,</HI> as well in many Di&s;tempers, where|of
I my&s;elf have felt the Weight, as in the Ca&s;es of
my <HI>Patients;</HI> and this <HI>Experience</HI> has led me to throw
off all <HI>un&s;ucce&s;sful</HI> Methods and <HI>Medicins,</HI> and to con|fine
my&s;elf to <HI>&s;uch</HI> only, by which I had Rea&s;on to
think the principal <HI>Point</HI> in View, <HI>viz.</HI> a <HI>la&s;ting Cure,</HI>
might be obtained. This Method of proceeding re|duces
the <HI>Practice</HI> of <HI>Phy&s;ic</HI> into a narrow Compa&s;s,
<HI>viz.</HI> 1. To proper <HI>Evacuations</HI> of the &s;everal proper
Kinds. 2. To <HI>attenuating</HI> and <HI>deob&s;truent</HI> Medicins,
of which I find the <HI>mild pondero&s;e</HI> to be generally the
be&s;t; and after a due U&s;e of the&s;e, 3. The gentle <HI>A&s;|tringents</HI>
and <HI>Strengthners</HI> of the Solids, 4. A proper
and <HI>&s;pecific Diet,</HI> with <HI>Air</HI> and <HI>Exerci&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>This is my general <HI>Sy&s;tem:</HI> This, if ju&s;t and &s;olid,
brings all that can be pertinently &s;aid on the <HI>Cure</HI> of
Di&s;tempers, into an ea&s;y and intelligible View, and
makes many of the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Methods and Medicins com|mon
to different <HI>Ca&s;es</HI> and <HI>Patients.</HI> Whatever
exceeds, is <HI>calculated</HI> either for the ea&s;y Death, or to
keep up the Courage and Hopes, of the <HI>Patient.</HI></P>
<P>It would not become me to &s;ay, that the Method
here laid down, how judiciou&s;ly &s;oever applied, will
in every <HI>Ca&s;e</HI> ab&s;olutely cure or &s;ave: This, however,
I venture to affirm, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Continuance of this
Method for a due Time, has done, in very bad Ca|&s;es,
<PB N="36" REF="40">
and, by <HI>GOD's Ble&s;&s;ing,</HI> will do more than any
other which has yet been &s;o &s;trongly and clearly en|forced
and explained, or is commonly u&s;ed.</P>
<P>I may be deceiv'd my&s;elf, but, if I know my own
Heart, have not a &s;ingle <HI>Temptation</HI> to deceive others.
My <HI>Age</HI> is little &s;hort of &s;eventy Years, at which
Time in Life, a <HI>Thought</HI> of adding to my <HI>Reputation,</HI>
or to my <HI>Pur&s;e,</HI> would be extreme Folly: The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> is
now at the Di&s;po&s;al of the <HI>Public,</HI> the <HI>latter</HI> will &s;oon
be in the Hands of my <HI>Executors.</HI></P>
<P>But after all, though I &s;hould <HI>convince</HI> the World,
I mu&s;t not expect to <HI>convert</HI> it: Le&s;&s;ons of <HI>Ab&s;tinence</HI>
and <HI>Self denial</HI> loo&s;e their <HI>Weight,</HI> when offered to
&s;trong <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> and <HI>high Spirits;</HI> and the greate&s;t Part
of my <HI>Di&s;ciples</HI> will probably always be &s;uch, as have
labour'd through the tedious <HI>Cour&s;es</HI> of <HI>Phy&s;ic</HI> with|out
Succe&s;s, who&s;e Sufferings have &s;oured the <HI>fal&s;e
Plea&s;ures</HI> re&s;ulting from <HI>&s;en&s;ual Appetites,</HI> and who are
at length willing to renounce <HI>Luxury,</HI> in order to le&s;|&s;en
<HI>Mi&s;ery.</HI> To the&s;e I <HI>&s;eriou&s;ly</HI> affirm, that this <HI>Me|thod,</HI>
&s;trictly and for Time &s;ufficient pur&s;ued, will af|ford
all the <HI>Ea&s;e</HI> which human <HI>Art</HI> can give, or hu|man
<HI>Nature</HI> receive; and as the <HI>Time</HI> is hourly &s;teal|ing
on, when <HI>Art</HI> can do no more, an Ob&s;ervance of
the&s;e <HI>Rules</HI> will be the calme&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t Way of <HI>ly|ing
down in Death.</HI></P>
<P>Let this &s;ingle Con&s;ideration then recommend the

<P>II. <HI>Cornaro,</HI> who was po&s;&s;ibly a &s;ingle In&s;tance, a|mong&s;t
Men of Rank and <HI>Affluence,</HI> of a long Life,
high Health and Spirits to the <HI>la&s;t,</HI> &s;ecured the&s;e va|luable
Ble&s;&s;ings by the mere Force of <HI>Regimen,</HI> even
after a luxurious, and con&s;equently an unhealthy and
di&s;pirited <HI>Youth.</HI> At Forty, he began to curb his Ap|petites,
and to manage his <HI>Diet,</HI> which, after &s;everal
<HI>E&s;&s;ays,</HI> he fixed at twelve Ounces of <HI>Food,</HI> and four|teen
of <HI>Wine</HI> in twenty-four Hours; from this Time,
(<HI>viz,</HI> the Age of Forty) gradually le&s;&s;ening his <HI>Diet,</HI>
till he reduced it to the Yolk of an Egg (<HI>i. e.</HI> about
an Ounce of &s;olid Food in twenty-four Hours, and
probably did the &s;ame by his <HI>Wine</HI>). He enjoyed a
perfect State of Health, and was at the &s;ame time in
<HI>high Spirits</HI> to the Age of an Hundred, or, as &s;ome
Authors &s;ay, an Hundred and Twenty: A very ex|traordinary
In&s;tance this, in a Man of <HI>Cornaro</HI>'s <HI>Rank</HI>
in <HI>Life,</HI> who had in his Youth indulged in <HI>high</HI> Food,
and <HI>rich</HI> Wine. Now it is highly probable, that from
the Time of the fir&s;t Reduction of his Food &s;o, at
the Age of Forty, he mu&s;t gradually have le&s;&s;ened
the daily <HI>Quantity,</HI> about two Ounces every ten Years,
till he had at Length reduced it to an Ounce a Day.
The happy Re&s;ult of this gradual <HI>Reduction</HI> &s;hews,
that he mu&s;t naturally have had &s;trong Solids: For I
am quite per&s;uaded, that if in&s;tead of this <HI>&s;tinted</HI>
Quantity of <HI>animal</HI> Food, he had, at the Age of For|ty,
confined him&s;elf to Cow's Milk and Bread, to
Vegetables and Water only, he might probably have
lived to a much greater Age, with a clearer <HI>Head,</HI>

Quantity of Bread, dureing all the Time, with a little
<HI>Sack</HI> and Water, of which, without any Regulation,
he took as he found a Craving, or <HI>Failure</HI> of Spirits.

was a Gentleman, who, in this corrupt Age,
did Honour to human Nature, and was a great In|&s;tance

<HI>Efficacy</HI> of the <HI>Grace, Wi&s;dom,</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> of the

<P>At one and the &s;ame Time he was a mo&s;t <HI>zealous

<HEAD>Some ACCOUNT of Dr. ARCHI|BALD
PITCAIRN, and his Wri|tings,
by Dr. SEWEL.</HEAD>
<P>DR. PITCAIRN was one of the fir&s;t, who
leaving the <HI>Old</HI> Conjectural Method of Phy|&s;ical
Writers, &s;truck into a <HI>New</HI> and more
Solid Way of Rea&s;oning, grounded upon Ob&s;ervati|ons
and Mathematical Principles.</P>
<P>He &s;tudied many Years abroad, where his great
Learning, and &s;ucce&s;sful Practice, procured him the
E&s;teem of all Foreigners, and &s;pread his Reputation
into as many different Countries, as the Variety of
Students of Phy&s;ic in <HI>Holland</HI> owed their Birth to, e|very
one carrying home a high Opinion of Dr PIT|CAIRN's
u&s;eful Knowledge in that Science.</P>
<P>The&s;e Qualifications in his Art rai&s;ed him in a little
Time to the Profe&s;&s;or&s;hip at <HI>Leyden,</HI> unto which he
was cho&s;e in the Year 1691, as much to the Reputa|tion
of the <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Nation as his own. Here he be|gan
his excellent Lectures, in a Manner, which con|firmed
his Auditors in the ju&s;t Notions they had con|ceived
of him, as of one who was to bani&s;h the Old
fal&s;e Maxims of Phy&s;ic, and lay more certain and
infallible Fundamentals of the mo&s;t comprehen&s;ive
Art the Mind of Man is capable of attaining. It were
needle&s;s to inform the Reader what <HI>Errors</HI> he reform|ed,
what <HI>new Lights</HI> he &s;pread over the Face of Phy|&s;ic,
and what <HI>admirable Hints</HI> he gave for its future
<PB N="45" REF="49">
Improvement, &s;uch as the Genius of a <HI>&s;econd</HI> PIT|CAIRN,
or a <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> MEAD, might indeed carry to
that de&s;ireable Pitch, which other Learned Men have
hitherto labour'd at in vain. There is no Page in his
<HI>Di&s;&s;ertations</HI> wherein &s;omething of this Nature may
not be ob&s;erved, and the Book it &s;elf will be the be&s;t
Evidence of the Truth we a&s;&s;ert.</P>
<P>He continued in the Chair at <HI>Leyden</HI> &s;ometime, and
publi&s;hed a great many of his curious Pieces in that
Place, all which were admired by the Learned of the
Faculty; and though &s;ome of his Opinions met with
<HI>Adver&s;aries,</HI> the Doctor had no Occa&s;ion to give him|&s;elf
the Trouble of a <HI>Vindication,</HI> the Ju&s;tne&s;s of his
Rea&s;oning rai&s;ing him up <HI>Advocates</HI> wherever Truth
prevailed over Sophi&s;try, and good Sen&s;e was prefer|red
to the Jargon of unintelligible Terms.</P>
<P>He had in all Probability continued longer at this
Place, but &s;ome private Concerns obliged him to re|tire
into his own Country, where his Fame had alrea|dy
made Way for an honourable Entertainment a|mong
all Per&s;ons of the be&s;t Sen&s;e and Quality. Here
he continued his Practice with equal Applau&s;e and
Succe&s;s, keeping at the &s;ame Time a Corre&s;pondence
with mo&s;t of the great Men of the Faculty in all Parts
of <HI>Europe,</HI> whom either his Writings or Conver&s;ation
at <HI>Leyden</HI> had made his Friends and Admirers. Indeed
he was the free&s;t and mo&s;t communicative of his Ad|vice
of any Per&s;on, perhaps, that ever made &s;o emi|nent
a Figure in his Profe&s;&s;ion, never refu&s;ing either
to &s;atisfy by Letter the Curio&s;ity, or inform the Mind
of the Enquirer. His <HI>Friend&s;hip</HI> with the great <HI>Belli|ni,</HI>
and Mon&s;. <HI>Hecquet,</HI> mu&s;t never be forgotten; and
it is evident from their Writings, that they &s;eemed
<PB N="46" REF="50">
to be proud of <HI>that Name,</HI> and took all Occa&s;ions to
do Ju&s;tice to the Merit of their <HI>Friend.</HI></P>
<P>This may lead us into &s;ome Part of his private
CHARACTER, of which there are too many Wit|ne&s;&s;es
living to make us &s;ay any Thing but &s;trict
Truth.</P>
<P>In the Bu&s;ine&s;s of his Profe&s;&s;ion he was always rea|dy
to &s;erve every one to the utmo&s;t of his Power,
and even to contribute to their Health at the Danger
of his own. He was a Man of too good Sen&s;e to be
a Humouri&s;t in Phy&s;ic, or refu&s;e Attendance out of
Pique, or Prejudice, or Affectation: He under&s;tood
the Value of Life too well to &s;acrifice it to Caprice
and Humour. There is one Thing more remarkable
of him; That he was not at all concern'd about Fees,
and frighted from his Duty by the Sight of Poverty
in his Patient, nay, he went with greater Chearful|ne&s;s
to tho&s;e from whom he could expect nothing but
good Will, than to Per&s;ons of the highe&s;t Conditi|on.
Be&s;ides, in Ca&s;es which &s;eemed to require that
A&s;&s;i&s;tance, he not only gave away his Skill and Me|dicines,
but extended his Genero&s;ity for the Provi&s;ion
of other Conveniences for the Sick, and left the
Marks of his Charity, as well as of the Liberality of
his Art, behind him. The Virtue of Charity was re|ally
&s;o much his own, in the U&s;e of it, that he con|trived
a mo&s;t &s;ecret and decent Manner of conveying
his Benevolence, and relieved many who knew not
their Benefactor.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, he was one of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t u&s;e|ful
Men in his Profe&s;&s;ion this Age has produced, of
a free and univer&s;al Genius, a good Orator, Poet,
and Philo&s;opher. He was of a plea&s;ant, engaging Hu|mour.
<PB N="47" REF="51">
Life &s;ate very ea&s;y upon him in all its Circum|&s;tances.
He de&s;pi&s;ed many, but hated none. He
loved his Friends, and laughed at his Enemies. Thus
he drew out Life to about &s;ixty Years: And it was
not long before he died, that he gave us that excel|lent
Picture of him&s;elf in a Copy of Ver&s;es, which
are at lea&s;t equal, both in their Ea&s;ine&s;s, Simplicity,
and Elegance of Thought and Stile, to any of CA|TULLUS,
and far &s;uperior to any modern Compo|&s;ition
of that Kind. They have been printed by Mr.

<HEAD>Some EXTRACTS from LEWIS CORNARO,
a Noble Venetian, concerning the Pre&s;ervation
of Health.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas &s;everal Per&s;ons, who&s;e weak Con&s;titu|tion
required great Care in the Management
of it, have been well &s;atisfied with what I
have written concerning Sobriety, the Experience which
they have had of the U&s;efulne&s;s of my Coun&s;els, and
the Acknowledgments which they have made thereof;
encourage me to take up my Pen again, that I may
convince tho&s;e, who meet with no Inconvenience from
Intemperance, that they are in the wrong in relying
&s;o much on the Strength of their Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Let it be ever &s;o well compos'd, yet it holds not
good but to &s;uch an Age. The&s;e Per&s;ons &s;eldom ar|rive
to Sixty, but they decay all of a &s;udden, and
perceive them&s;elves loaded with a Complication of Di&s;|tempers.
Some are Gouty, Drop&s;ical, and Rheuma|tical:
Others are &s;ubject to Cholicks, the Stone and
Piles; la&s;tly, to abundance of Di&s;tempers, which
would probably never have happen'd to them, if they
had been &s;o wife as to have taken Care of them&s;elves
in their Youth. If they die infirm at Four&s;core Years
of Age, they might have lived in Health to an Hun|dred,
and &s;o have run out the Term of Life, which
Nature has left open to all Men.</P>
<P>It is to be &s;uppo&s;ed that this common Parent wi&s;h|es
that all her Children might live at lea&s;t a Century;
and &s;ince &s;ome among them have lived to a longer
Date, why &s;hould not others have a Right of expect|ing
the &s;ame Advantage?</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="56">
I do not di&s;agree, but that we are &s;ubject to the
Stars which were predominant at our Birth. Their
good or bad A&s;pects, enfeeble or &s;trengthen the
Springs of our Life; but Man being endued with
Judgment and Rea&s;on, ought to repair by his prudent
Conduct, the Harm which his Planet may have done
him; he may prolong his Days by the Means of a
&s;ober Life, to as long a Period, as if he had been
born Strong and Lu&s;ty. Prudence prevents and cor|rects
the Malignity of the Planets; they give us cer|tain
Inclinations, they carry us out to certain Pa&s;&s;ions;
but they lay no Violence upon us, we may re&s;i&s;t 'em,
and in this Sen&s;e a wife Man is above the Stars.</P>
<P>I was born very Cholerick and Ha&s;ty; I flew out
into Pa&s;&s;ion for the lea&s;t Trifle; I huffed all Mankind,
and was &s;o intolerable, that a great many Per&s;ons of
Repute avoided my Company. I apprehended the
Injury which I did my &s;elf; I knew that Anger is a
real Frenzy; that it di&s;turbs our Judgment, that it
tran&s;ports us beyond our &s;elves, and that the Differ|ence
between a pa&s;&s;ionate and a mad Man, is only
this, that the latter has lo&s;t his Rea&s;on for ever,
and the former is only deprived of it by Fits. A
&s;ober Life cured me of this Frenzy; by its A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
I became &s;o moderate, and &s;o much Ma&s;ter
of my Pa&s;&s;ion, that no Body could perceive that
it was born with me.</P>
<P>A Man may likewi&s;e with Rea&s;on, and a regu|lar
Life, correct a bad Con&s;titution; and notwith|&s;tanding
the Tenderne&s;s thereof, may live a long
Time in good Health. I &s;hould never have &s;een Forty
Years, had I followed all my Inclinations, and yet I
am in the Eighty Sixth Year of my Age. If the long
and dangerous Di&s;tempers which I had in my Youth,
had not con&s;umed a great deal of the Radical Moi&s;t|ure,
the Lo&s;s of which is irreparable, I might have
<PB N="53" REF="57">
promis'd my &s;elf to have liv'd a compleat Century.
But without flattering my &s;elf, I find it to be a great
Matter to have arrived to Forty Six Years more than
I ever expected, and that in my Old Age my Con&s;ti|tution
is &s;till &s;o good, that not only my Teeth, my
Voice, my Memory, and my Heart, are in as good
a Condition, as ever they were in the bri&s;ke&s;t Days
of my Youth; but likewi&s;e my Judgment has lo&s;t
nothing of its Clearne&s;s and Force.</P>
<P>I am of the Opinion, that this proceeds from the
Abridgment I make of my Food, proportionably to
my growing into Years. Experience, which tells us,
that Infants have a greater Appetite, and are more
often hungry, than grown Men, ought likewi&s;e to
teach us, that in Old Age we have le&s;s need of Nour|i&s;hment,
than in the Beginning of Life. A Man who
is very old, can hardly eat, becau&s;e he can &s;carce di|ge&s;t
what he eats; a little &s;erves his Turn, and the
Yolk of an Egg is a good Meal to him. I &s;hall be
&s;atisfied therewith to the End of my Days, hopeing,
by this Conduct, neither to dye with Violence, nor
with Pain, not que&s;tioning but that they who will
imitate me, will meet with as ea&s;y an Exit, &s;ince we
are all of the &s;ame <HI>Species,</HI> and made up of the &s;ame
Materials.</P>
<P>Since nothing then is more advantageous for a Man
upon Earth, than to live long; he is obliged to pre|&s;erve
his Health as far as po&s;&s;ible, and this he cannot
do without Sobriety. 'Tis true, indeed, that there
are &s;everal who eat and drink plentifully, and yet live
to an Hundred Years of Age. 'Tis by their Exam|ple
that others flatter them&s;elves with the Hopes of
attaining to the &s;ame Age, without any Occa&s;ion of
laying a Re&s;traint upon them&s;elves. But they are in
the wrong upon the&s;e two Accounts: Fir&s;t, becau&s;e
there is hardly one in a Thou&s;and, that has &s;o &s;trong
<PB N="54" REF="58">
a Con&s;titution. Secondly, becau&s;e &s;uch Men do gene|rally
end their Lives by &s;uch Di&s;tempers, as put them
into great Agonies by dying, which would never hap|pen
to tho&s;e that have the &s;ame Government of them|&s;elves
that I have. A Man runs the Ri&s;que of not
attaining to Fifty Years of Age, for not daring to
undertake a regular Cour&s;e of Life; which is no im|po&s;&s;ible
Thing, &s;ince 'tis what I, and &s;everal others,
have practi&s;ed, and do practi&s;e. And a Man becomes
in&s;en&s;ibly a Murderer of him&s;elf; becau&s;e he cannot
be per&s;uaded, that notwith&s;tanding the fal&s;e Charms
of a voluptuous Life, a wi&s;e Man ought not to look
upon it as any Hard&s;hip, to put in Practice what his
Rea&s;on advi&s;es him.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on, if we hearken to it, will tell us, that a
good Regimen is nece&s;&s;ary for the prolonging of our
Days; and that it con&s;i&s;ts in Two Things: Fir&s;t, in
taking Care of the Quality; and, Secondly, of the
Quantity; &s;o as to eat and drink nothing that offends
the Stomach, nor any more than what we can ea&s;ily
dige&s;t. Our Experience ought to be our Guide in the&s;e
Two Principles, when we are arriv'd to Forty, Fifty,
or Three&s;core Years of Age. He who puts in Prac|tice
that Knowledge which he has of what is good for
him, and goes on in a frugal way of Living, keeps
the Humours in a ju&s;t Temperature, and prevents
them from being alter'd; tho' he &s;uffer Heat and
Cold, tho' he be fatigu'd, tho' his Sleep be broke;
provided there be no Exce&s;s in any of them. This
being &s;o; what an Obligation does a Man lie under
of living &s;oberly? And ought he not to free him&s;elf
from the Fears of &s;inking under the lea&s;t Intempera|ture
of the Air, and under the lea&s;t Fatigue, which
make us &s;ick upon every &s;light Occa&s;ion?</P>
<P>'Tis true, indeed, the mo&s;t &s;ober may &s;ometimes
be indi&s;po&s;ed, when they are unavoidably oblig'd to
<PB N="55" REF="59">
tran&s;gre&s;s the Rules which they have been u&s;ed to ob|&s;erve:
But then, they are certain, that their Indi&s;po|&s;ition
will not la&s;t above Two or Three Days at mo&s;t;
nor can they fall into a Fever. Wearine&s;s and Faint|ne&s;s
are ea&s;ily remedied by Re&s;t and good Diet. The
Malignancy of the Stars cannot put the malignant
Humours in a Ferment, in Bodies which have them
not: Tho' Di&s;tempers which proceed from Intempe|rance,
have an internal Cau&s;e, and may be dangerous;
tho&s;e which are deriv'd from the Influences of the
Planets, affect us only externally, and cannot produce
any great Di&s;orders.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome who feed high, and maintain, that
what&s;oever they eat is &s;o little Di&s;turbance to them,
that they cannot perceive in what Part of their Body
their Stomach lies; but I aver, that they do not &s;peak
as they think; nor is it natural. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible, that
any created Being &s;hould be of &s;o perfect a Compo&s;i|tion,
as that neither Heat nor Cold, Dry nor Moi&s;t,
&s;hould have any Influence over it; and that the Vari|ety
of Food which they make u&s;e of, of different
Qualities, &s;hould be equally agreeable to them. Tho&s;e
Men cannot but acknowledge, that they are &s;ome|times
out of Order: If it is not owing to a &s;en&s;ible
Indige&s;tion, yet they are troubled with Head-achs,
want of Sleep, and Fevers; of which they are cur'd
by a Diet, and taking &s;uch Medicines as are proper
for Evacuation. It is therefore certain, that their
Di&s;tempers proceed from Repletion, or from their
having eat or drank &s;omething which did not agree
with their Stomachs.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t old People excu&s;e their high Feeding, by &s;ay|ing,
that it is nece&s;&s;ary for them to eat a great deal,
to keep up their natural Heat, which dimini&s;hes pro|portionably
as they grow in Years; and, to create an
Appetite, 'tis requi&s;ite to find out proper Sauces, and
<PB N="56" REF="60">
to eat whatever they have a Fancy for; and that
without thus humouring their Palates, they &s;hould
be &s;oon in their Graves. To this I reply, That Na|ture,
for the Pre&s;ervation of a Man in Years, has
&s;o compos'd him, that he may live with a little Food;
that his Stomach cannot dige&s;t a great Quantity; and
that he has no need of being afraid of dying for want
of eating, &s;ince when he is &s;ick, he is forc'd to have
Recour&s;e to a regular Sort of Diet, which is the fir&s;t
and main Thing pre&s;crib'd him by his Phy&s;icians.
La&s;tly, That if this Remedy is of &s;uch Efficacy, as
to &s;natch us out of the Arms of Death, 'tis a Mi&s;t|ake
to &s;uppo&s;e, that a Man may not, by eating a lit|tle
more than he does when he is &s;ick, live a long
Time without ever being &s;ick.</P>
<P>Others had rather be di&s;turb'd Twice or Thrice a
Year with the Gout, the <HI>Sciatica,</HI> and other Epide|mical
Di&s;tempers, than to be always put to the Tor|ment
and Mortification of laying a Re&s;traint upon
their Appetites; being &s;ure, that when they are in|di&s;po&s;ed,
a regular Diet will be an infallible Remedy
and Cure. But let them be inform'd by me, that as
they grow up in Years, their natural Heat abates:
That a regular Diet, de&s;pis'd as a Precaution, and
only look'd upon as Ph&s;iyc, cannot always have the
&s;ame Effect nor Force to draw off the Crudities, and
repair the Di&s;orders, which are cau&s;ed by Repletion;
and, la&s;tly, that they run the Hazard of being cheat|ed,
by their Hope and their Intemperance.</P>
<P>Others &s;ay, that it is more eligible to feed high,
and enjoy them&s;elves, tho' a Man lives the le&s;s
while. It is no &s;urprizing Matter, that Fools and
Madmen &s;hould contemn and de&s;pi&s;e Life; the World
would be no Lo&s;er, whenever they go out of it: But
'tis a con&s;iderable Lo&s;s, when wi&s;e, virtuous, and
holy Men drop into the Grave. If one of them were
<PB N="57" REF="61">
a Bi&s;hop, he might have been an Archbi&s;hop, in
growing older: If he were in &s;ome con&s;iderable Po&s;t
in the State, he might have arrived to the highe&s;t: If
he were learned, or excelled in any Art, he would
have been more excellent, and done more Honour to
his Country and him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Others there are, who perceiving them&s;elves to
grow old, tho' their Stomach becomes le&s;s capable of
dige&s;ting well every day than other, yet will not, on
that Account, abate any Thing of their Diet. They
only abridge them&s;elves of the Number of their Meals;
and becau&s;e they find two or three times a day is troub|le&s;ome,
they think their Health is &s;ufficiently provi|ded
for, by making only one Meal; that &s;o the time
between one Repa&s;t and another, may (as they &s;ay)
facilitate the Dige&s;tion of tho&s;e Aliments, which they
might have taken at twice: For this Rea&s;on, they eat
at this one Meal &s;o much, that their Stomach is over|charg'd,
and out of Order, and converts the Super|fluities
of its Nouri&s;hment into bad Humours, which
engender Di&s;ea&s;es and Death. I never knew a Man
that liv'd long by this Conduct. The&s;e Men would
doubtle&s;s have prolong'd their Days, had they abridg'd
the Quantity of their ordinary Food, proportionably
as they grew in Years, and had eaten a great deal le&s;s,
and a little oftner.</P>
<P>Some again are of Opinion, That Sobriety may in|deed
pre&s;erve a Man in Health, but does not prolong
his Life: To this we &s;ay, That there have been Per|&s;ons
in pa&s;t Ages, who have prolong'd their Lives by
this Means; and &s;ome there are at pre&s;ent, who &s;till
do: It &s;hortens not our Days, as the Infirmities con|tracted
by Repletion do. A Man of an ordinary Reach
may perceive, that, if he de&s;ires to live long, it is
better to be well than &s;ick; and that, con&s;equently,
<PB N="58" REF="62">
Temperance contributes more to a long Life, than an
exce&s;&s;ive high Feeding.</P>
<P>What&s;oever the Sen&s;uali&s;ts may &s;ay, Temperance
is of infinite Benefit to Mankind: To it he owes his
Pre&s;ervation: It bani&s;hes from his Mind the di&s;mal
Apprehen&s;ion of dying: 'Tis by its Means that he
becomes wi&s;e, and arrives to an Age, wherein Rea&s;on
and Experience furni&s;h him with A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to free
him&s;elf from the Tyranny of his Pa&s;&s;ions, which have
lorded it over him for almo&s;t the whole Cour&s;e of
his Life.</P>
<P>O happy State of Life! which, be&s;ides other Ble&s;|&s;ings
with which thou favoure&s;t an Old Man, do&s;t
pre&s;erve his Stomach in &s;o perfect a Tone, as to make
him reli&s;h a Piece of dry Bread, better than the Vo|luptuous
do all their dainty Mor&s;els, and be&s;t &s;ea&s;on'd
Di&s;hes. The Appetite which thou gave&s;t us for Bread,
is ju&s;t and rea&s;onable; &s;ince 'tis the mo&s;t proper Food
for Mankind, when attended with a De&s;ire of Eating.
A &s;ober Life is never without &s;uch an Appetite. So
that by eating a little, my Stomach is often craving
after the Manna; which I &s;ometimes reli&s;h with &s;o
much Plea&s;ure, that I &s;hould think I tre&s;pa&s;s upon the
Duty of Temperance, did I not know that one mu&s;t
eat it to &s;upport Life; and that one cannot make u&s;e
of a plainer, and a more natural Diet.</P>
<P>My Spirits are not injur'd by what I eat; they are
only reviv'd and &s;upported by it. I always find my
&s;elf in an even Temper, always chearful; and more
&s;o after, than before Meals. I u&s;e my &s;elf, pre&s;ently
upon ri&s;ing from Table, to write or &s;tudy, and never
find, that this Application of Mind, after Eating, is
prejudicial to me: For I am equally capable at all
Times of doing it, and never perceive my &s;elf drow|$$y,
as a great many People do. The Rea&s;on of this
is, becau&s;e the little I eat is not &s;ufficient to &s;end up
<PB N="59" REF="63">
the Fumes from the Stomach to the Head, which fill
the Brain, and render it uncapable of performing its
Functions.</P>
<P>What I eat, is as follows; <HI>viz.</HI> Bread, Soop, new|laid
Eggs, Veal, Kid, Mutton, Partridges, Pullets,
and Pidgeons. Among the Sea-fi&s;h, I chu&s;e <HI>Goldenis,</HI>
and of the River-fi&s;h, the Pike. All the&s;e <HI>Aliments</HI>
are proper for old Men; who, if they be <HI>wi&s;e for
them&s;elves,</HI> would be contented with the&s;e, and &s;eek
for no other.</P>
<P>A poor old Man, who has not wherewith to pur|cha&s;e
all the&s;e, &s;hould be &s;atisfied with Bread, Broth,
and Eggs; but not to eat much of them at a Time;
and &s;o to regulate him&s;elf, with re&s;pect to the Quan|tity
of his Diet, as that he may not die but by a meer
Di&s;&s;olution. For it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that a Stab,
or the like, is the only violent Death; Fevers, and a
great many other Di&s;tempers, of which one dies in
Bed, are to be counted as &s;uch, being cau&s;ed by tho&s;e
Humours, again&s;t which Nature would not &s;truggle,
if they were Natural.</P>
<P>I cannot under&s;tand how it comes to pa&s;s that
&s;o many, otherwi&s;e prudent and rational, cannot re|&s;olve
upon laying a Re&s;traint upon their in&s;atiable
Appetites, at Fifty or Three&s;core Years of Age,
or at lea&s;t when they begin to feel the Infirmities
of old Age coming upon them. They might rid
them&s;elves of them by a &s;trict Diet; but they be|come
incurable, becau&s;e they will not ob&s;erve a
<HI>Regimen.</HI> I do not wonder &s;o much, that young
People are &s;o hardly brought to &s;uch a Re&s;olution;
they are not capable enough of reflecting, and their
Judgment is not &s;olid enough to re&s;i&s;t the Charms
of Sen&s;e: But at Fifty, a Man ought to be go|vern'd
by his Rea&s;on, which would convince us,
if we would hearken to it, that to gratify all our
<PB N="60" REF="64">
Appetites, without any Rule or Mea&s;ure, is the
way to become infirm, and to die young. Nor does
the Plea&s;ure of Ta&s;te la&s;t long, it hardly begins,
but 'tis gone and pa&s;t; the more one eats, the more
one may, and the Di&s;tempers which it brings along
with it, la&s;t us to our Graves. Now &s;hould not a
&s;ober Man be very well &s;atisfied, when he is at
Table, upon the A&s;&s;urance, that as often as he ri&s;es
from it, what he eats will do him no Harm?</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>MAXIMS for the prolonging of LIFE.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS not good to eat too much, or to fa&s;t too
long, or to do any thing el&s;e that is preter|natural.</P>
<P>Whoever eats or drinks too much, will be &s;ick.
The Di&s;tempers of Repletion are cur'd by Ab|&s;tinence.</P>
<P>Old Men can fa&s;t ea&s;ily; Men of ripe Age can
fa&s;t almo&s;t as much; but young Per&s;ons, and Chil|dren,

<P>Growing Per&s;ons have a great deal of Natural
Heat, which requires a great deal of Nouri&s;hment,

<P>Human Breath, &s;ays M. <HI>Cohau&s;en,</HI> is no other than
Air expre&s;&s;ed by the Lungs, and, con&s;equently, &s;atu|rated
with Particles from the Blood of the Per&s;on
di&s;charging it. As a Per&s;on labouring under an in|fectious
Di&s;ea&s;e may communicate it by his Breath;
&s;o the pure Breath, and in&s;en&s;ible Tran&s;piration, of a
healthy young Girl, may contribute to rou&s;e the &s;lug|gi&s;h
Motion of an old Man's Blood, and give it a
bri&s;k and &s;trong Circulation. There are various Ex|amples
of the great Power of Air and Odours, in
nouri&s;hing human Bodies, and at lea&s;t, in &s;upporting
and maintaining the Lamp of Life, when almo&s;t ex|tingui&s;hed.
And he &s;hews, from natural Rea&s;on, that
the human Breath may bring People out of a Swoon.</P>
<P>Having laid down the&s;e Principles, he &s;tates his
Hypothe&s;is thus in the Platonick Style; When <HI>Thy&s;he</HI>
emits her Breath, &s;he throws off, with that Air, cer|tain
Spirits or Vapours from her Blood. <HI>Hermippus</HI>
re&s;piring them, they ea&s;ily mix with his Blood. Thus
the Vapour excited by the vital Heat of <HI>Thy&s;be,</HI> pa&s;&s;es
thro' the Aether into the Lungs and Blood of <HI>Her|mippus;</HI>
without a Metaphor we may &s;ay, that the
Spirits of <HI>Thy&s;be</HI> warm the Heart of the old Man.
For the&s;e Spirits being vigorous, full of Life and
Vivacity, they mu&s;t naturally re-animate the half-frozen
Blood of <HI>Hermippus.</HI> We may even go &s;o far
as to &s;ay, that with his own he enjoys a borrow'd Life;
and therefore we need not wonder, that he &s;hould <HI>la&s;t</HI>
twice as long as other Men.</P>
<P>The Condition of Life, therefore, which is mo&s;t
capable of furni&s;hing &s;uch a con&s;tant Supply of young
and whol&s;om Breaths, mu&s;t be very eligible. Our
Doctor &s;ugge&s;ts that of a Director of a College of
young Women, or, in other Words, a Confe&s;&s;or of
<PB N="63" REF="67">
youthful Nuns; and in &s;upport of this Notion, he re|marks,
that &s;uch as have had the Education of young
People, have frequently reach'd a very advanc'd Age.</P>
<P>The Sophi&s;t <HI>Gorgias</HI> lived to be 108, the Sophi&s;t
<HI>Protagoras</HI> to 90, the celebrated Philo&s;opher and Rhe|torician,
<HI>I&s;ocrates,</HI> to 98, the Grammarian <HI>Euphranor</HI>
taught at upwards of 100, and <HI>Orbilius,</HI> who was fa|mous
for his ill Nature, lived a Century. To the&s;e
he adds <HI>Lewis Cornaro,</HI> a Nobleman of <HI>Venice,</HI> who
had been always infirm to his 35th Year, and then
abandoning Medicines, prolong'd his Life to 90 by
Dint of a wi&s;e Regimen. Among&s;t other Particulars
he tells us this; That he bred up 11 of his Nephews,
all Sons of the &s;ame Father and Mother, and all &s;tout
healthy Youths; that with the&s;e, after he return'd
from the Senate, he us'd to play and dance. He adds,
that little Children made always a Part of his Amu&s;e|ments,
and that he look'd upon them, till they were
upwards of Five Years old, as &s;o many little Players,
to whom he owed the greate&s;t Plea&s;ure he enjoyed in
the latter Part of his Life, and, which is more to our
Purpo&s;e, the Pre&s;ervation of his Health.</P>
<P>In the Maidens, which he would have bred up un|der
his <HI>Hermippus,</HI> the Doctor requires that they
&s;hould be all young, innocent, cha&s;te, healthy, and
have &s;weet Breaths. Such, he &s;uppo&s;es, was <HI>Abi&s;hag</HI>
the Shunamite, whom the Phy&s;icians recommended
to King <HI>David</HI> to warm his Blood, by lying with him
in the Night, and &s;erving him in the Day. He like|wi&s;e
&s;uppo&s;es, that the innocent Pa&s;times, the cha&s;te
Care&s;&s;es, the humourous Frolicks of the&s;e young
People, &s;hould rejoice and revive the Spirits of the
old Man; who, he takes it for granted, mu&s;t be of
a gentle, chearful Di&s;po&s;ition, and equally ready to
indulge, and even to &s;hare in their Plea&s;ures.</P>
