<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HE that has Truth and Ju&s;tice, and the Intere&s;t of <HI>Eng|land</HI>
in his De&s;ign, can have nothing to fear from an
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament.</P>
<P>This makes the Author of the&s;e Sheets, however De&s;|picable
in him&s;elf, apply to this Honourable Hou&s;e, without any
Apology for the Pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>Truth, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> however meanly dre&s;s'd, and in what&s;oever
bad Company &s;he happens to come, was always entertain'd at
your Bar; and the Commons of <HI>England</HI> mu&s;t cea&s;e to act like
them&s;elves, or which is wor&s;e, like their Ance&s;tors, when they
cea&s;e to entertain any Propo&s;al, that offers it &s;elf at their Door, for
the general Good and Advantage of the People they Repre&s;ent.</P>
<P>I willingly grant, That 'tis a Crime in good Manners to in|terrupt
your more weighty Councils, and di&s;turb your Debates;
with empty nau&s;eous Trifles in Value, or mi&s;taken Schemes,
and whoever ventures to Addre&s;s You, ought to be well a&s;&s;ur'd
he is in the right, and that the Matter &s;uits the Intent of your
meeting, <HI>viz. To di&s;patch the weighty Affairs of the Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>And as I have premis'd this, &s;o I freely &s;ubmit to any Cen&s;ure
this Honourable A&s;&s;embly &s;hall think I de&s;erve, if I have broke
in upon either of the&s;e Particulars.</P>
<P>I have but one Petition to make with re&s;pect to the Author,
and that is, That no freedom of Expre&s;&s;ion, which the Argu|ments
may oblige him to, may be con&s;tru'd as a want of Re&s;pect,
and a breach of the due Deference every <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man owes to the
repre&s;enting Power of the Nation.</P>
<P>It would be hard, that while I am hone&s;tly offering to your
Con&s;ideration &s;omething of Moment for the general Good, Pre|judice
<PB N="4" REF="3">
&s;hould lay Snares for the Author, and private Pique make
him an Offender for a Word.</P>
<P>Without entring upon other Parts of my Character, 'tis enough
to acquaint this A&s;&s;embly, that I am an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Freeholder, and
have by that a Title to be concern'd in the good of that Commu|munity
of which I am an unworthy Member.</P>
<P>This Honourable Hou&s;e is the Repre&s;entative of all the Free|holders
of <HI>England;</HI> you are A&s;&s;embl'd for their Good, you &s;tudy
their Intere&s;t, you po&s;&s;e&s;s Hearts, and you hold the Strings
of the general Pur&s;e.</P>
<P>To you they have Recour&s;e for the Redre&s;s of all their Wrongs,
and if at any time one of their Body can offer to your A&s;&s;i&s;tance,
any fair, legal, hone&s;t and rational Propo&s;al for the publick Be|nefit,
it was never known that &s;uch a Man was either rejected or
di&s;courag'd.</P>
<P>And on this Account I crave the Liberty to a&s;&s;ure you, That the
Author of this &s;eeks no Reward; to him it &s;hall always be Re|ward
enough to have been capable of &s;erving his native Country,
and Honour enough to have offer'd &s;omething for the publick
Good worthy of Con&s;ideration in your Honourable A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P><HI>Pauper &V;hique jacet,</HI> &s;aid our famous Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> when in
her Progre&s;s thro' the Kingdom &s;he &s;aw the va&s;t Throngs of the
Poor, flocking to &s;ee and ble&s;s her; and the Thought put her
Maje&s;ty upon a continu'd &s;tudy how to recover her People from
that Poverty, and make their Labour more pro&s;itable to them|&s;elves
in Particular, and the Nation in General.</P>
<P>This was ea&s;ie then to propo&s;e, for that many u&s;eful Manu|factures
were made in foreign Parts, which our People bought
with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Money, and Imported for their u&s;e.</P>
<P>The Queen, who knew the Wealth and va&s;t Numbers of Peo|ple
which the &s;aid Manufactures had brought to the neighbouring
Countries then under the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> being not yet
Revolted, never left off endeavouring what &s;he happily brought
to pa&s;s, <HI>viz.</HI> the tran&s;planting into <HI>England</HI> tho&s;e Springs of Riches
and People.</P>
<P>She &s;aw the <HI>Flemings</HI> prodigiou&s;ly Numerous, their Cities &s;tood
thicker than her Peoples Villages in &s;ome parts; all &s;orts of u&s;eful
Manufactures were found in their Towns, and all their People
<PB N="5" REF="4">
were rich and bu&s;ie, no Beggars, no Idlene&s;s, and con&s;equently
no want was to be &s;een among them.</P>
<P>She &s;aw the Fountain of all this Wealth and Workman&s;hip, I
mean the Wool, was in her own Hands, and <HI>Flanders</HI> became the
Seat of all the&s;e Manufactures, not becau&s;e it was naturally
Richer and more Populous than other Countries, but becau&s;e it
lay near <HI>England,</HI> and the Staple of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Wool which was
the Foundation of all their Wealth, was at <HI>Antwerp</HI> in the Heart of
that Country.</P>
<P>From hence, it may be &s;aid of <HI>Flanders,</HI> it was not the Riches
and the number of People brought the Manufactures into the
<HI>Low Countries,</HI> but it was the Manufactures brought the People
thither, and Multitudes of People make Trade, Trade makes
Wealth, Wealth builds Cities, Cities Enrich the Land round
them, Land Enrich'd ri&s;es in Value, and the Value of Lands En|riches
the Government.</P>
<P>Many Projects were &s;et on foot in <HI>England</HI> to Erect the Wool|len
Manufacturer here, and in &s;ome Places it had found Encou|ragement,
before the Days of this Queen, e&s;pecially as to mak|ing
of Cloath, but Stuffs, Bays, Says, Serges, and &s;uch like
Wares were yet wholly the Work of the <HI>Flemings.</HI></P>
<P>At la&s;t an Opportunity offer'd perfectly unlook'd for, <HI>viz.</HI> The
Per&s;ecution of the Prote&s;tants, and introducing the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> In|qui&s;ition
into <HI>Flanders,</HI> with the Tyranny of the Duke <HI>D'Alva.</HI></P>
<P>It cannot be an ungrateful Ob&s;ervation, here to take notice how
Tyranny and Per&s;ecution, the one an Oppre&s;&s;ion of Property,
the other of Con&s;cience, always Ruine Trade, Impoveri&s;h Nati|ons,
Depopulate Countries, Dethrone Princes, and De&s;troy
Peace.</P>
<P>When an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man reflects on it, he cannot without infi|nite
Satisfaction look up to Heaven, and to this Honourable
Hou&s;e, <HI>that</HI> as the &s;pring, <HI>this</HI> as the Stream <HI>from</HI> and <HI>by</HI> which
the Felicity of this Nation has obtain'd a Pitch of Glory, Superior
to all the People in the World.</P>
<P>Your Councils e&s;pecially, when ble&s;t from Heaven, <HI>as now we
tru&s;t they are,</HI> with Principles of Unanimity and Concord, can
never fail to make Trade Flouri&s;h, War Succe&s;sful, Peace cer|tain,
<PB N="6" REF="5">
Wealth flowing, Ble&s;&s;ings probable, the Queen Glorious,
and the People Happy.</P>
<P>Our unhappy Neighbours of the <HI>Low Countries</HI> were the very
Rever&s;e of what we <HI>ble&s;s our &s;elves for in You.</HI></P>
<P>Their Kings were Tyrants, their Governours Per&s;ecutors, their
Armies Thieves and Blood-hounds.</P>
<P>Their People Divided, their Councils Confus'd, and their Mi|&s;eries
Innumerable.</P>
<P><HI>D'Alva</HI> the <HI>Spami&s;h</HI> Governor, Be&s;ieg'd their Cities, Deeimated
the Inhabitants, Murther'd their Nobility, Pro&s;crib'd their Princes
and Executed 18000 Men by the Hand of the Hang-man.</P>
<P>Con&s;cience was trampl'd under foot, Religion and Reformati|on
hunted like a Hare upon the Mountains, the Inqui&s;ition threat|ned,
and Foreign Armies introduc'd.</P>
<P>Property fell a Sacrifice to Ab&s;olute Power, the Countrey was
Ravag'd, the Towns Plunder'd, the Rich Con&s;i&s;cated, the Poor
Starv'd, Trade Interrupted, and the <HI>10th.</HI> Penny demanded.</P>
<P>The Con&s;equence of this was, <HI>as in all Tyrannies and Per&s;ecuti|ons
it is,</HI> the People fled and &s;catter'd them&s;elves in their Neigh|bours
Countries, Trade langui&s;h'd, Manufactures went abroad,
and never returne'd, Confu&s;ion reign'd, and Pover$y &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>The Multitude that remain'd, pu&s;h'd to all Extremities, were
forc'd to obey the Voice of Nature, and in their own ju&s;t Defence
to take Arms again&s;t their Governours.</P>
<P><HI>De&s;truction it &s;elf has its u&s;es in the World,</HI> the A&s;hes of one Ci|ty
Rebuilds another, and God Almighty, who never acts in vain,
brought the Wealth of <HI>England,</HI> and the Power of <HI>Holland</HI> into
the World from the Ruine of the <HI>Flemi&s;h Liberty.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> in defence of their Liberty revolted, renounc'd
their Tyrant Prince, and pro&s;per'd by Heaven and the A&s;&s;i&s;tance
of <HI>England,</HI> erected the greate&s;t Com$ion-wealth in the World.</P>
<P>Innumerable Ob&s;ervations would flow from this part of the
pre&s;ent Subject, but Brevity is my &s;tudy, I am not teaching, for
I know who I &s;peak to, but relating and ob&s;erving the Connex$|on
of Cau&s;es, and the wonderous Births which <HI>lay then</HI> in the
Womb of Providence, and are &s;ince come to life.</P>
<P>Particulary how Heaven directed the Oppre&s;&s;ion and Tyranny
of the Poor &s;hould be the Wheel to turn over the great Machine
of Trade from <HI>Flanders</HI> into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">
And how the Per&s;ecution and Cruelty of the <HI>Spiniards</HI> again&s;t
Religion &s;hould be directed by the &s;ecret Over-ruling Hand, to be
the Foundation of a People, and a Body that &s;hould in Ages then
to come, be one of the chief Bulwarks of that very Liberty and
Religion they &s;ought to de&s;troy.</P>
<P>In this general Ruine of Trade and Liberty, <HI>England</HI> made
a Gain of what &s;he never yet lo&s;t, and of what &s;he has &s;ince en|creas'd
to an inconceivible Magnitude.</P>
<P>As <HI>D'Alva</HI> worried the poor <HI>Flemings,</HI> the Queen of <HI>England</HI> en|tertain'd
them, cheri&s;h'd them, invited them, encourag'd them.</P>
<P>Thou&s;ands of innocent People fled from all Parts from the Fu|ry
of this Mercile&s;s Man, and as <HI>England, to her Honour</HI> has al|ways
been the Sanctuary of her di&s;tre&s;s'd Neighbours, &s;o now
&s;he was &s;o to her &s;pecial and particular Profit.</P>
<P>The Queen who &s;aw the Opportunity put into her hands which &s;he
had &s;o long wi&s;h'd for, not only receiv'd kindly the Exil'd <HI>Flemings,</HI>
but invited over all that would come, promi&s;ing them all po&s;&s;ible
Encouragement, Priviledges and Freedom of her Ports and the like.</P>
<P>This brought over a va&s;t multitude of <HI>Flemings, Walloons,</HI>
and <HI>Dutch,</HI> who with their whole Families &s;ettled at <HI>Norwich,</HI> at
<HI>Ip&s;wich, Colche&s;ter, Canterbury, Exeter,</HI> and the like. From the&s;e
came the <HI>Walloon</HI> Church at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Churches
<HI>Norwich, Colche&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Yarmouth;</HI> from hence came the True
born <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Families at tho&s;e Places with Foreign Names; as
the <HI>De Vinks</HI> at <HI>Norwich,</HI> the <HI>Rebows</HI> at <HI>Colche&s;ter,</HI> the Papilons,
&amp;c. at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> Families to whom this Nation are much in
debt for the fir&s;t planting tho&s;e Manufactures, from which we
have &s;ince rais'd the greate&s;t Trades in the World.</P>
<P>This wife Queen knew that number of Inhabitants are the
Wealth and Strength of a Nation, &s;he was far from that Opinion,
we have of late &s;hown too much of in complaining that Foreigners
came to take the Bread out of our Mouths, and ill treating on
that account the <HI>French</HI> Prote&s;tants who fled hither for Refuge in
the late Per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>Some have &s;aid that above 50000 of them &s;ettled here, and
would have made it a Grievance, tho' without doubt 'tis ea&s;ie to
make it appear that 500000 more would be both u&s;eful and pro|fitable
to this Nation.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">
Upon the &s;etling of the&s;e Forreigners, the Scale of Trade vi&s;i|bly
turn'd both here and in <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Flemings</HI> taught our Women and Children to Spin, the
Youth to Weave, the Men entred the Loom to labour in&s;tead of
going abroad to &s;eek their Fortunes by the War, the &s;everal
Trades of <HI>Bayes</HI> at <HI>Colche&s;ter, Sayes</HI> and <HI>Perpets,</HI> at <HI>Sudbury,
Ip&s;wich,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Stuffs</HI> at <HI>Norwich, Serges</HI> at <HI>Exeter, Silks</HI> at <HI>Canterbu|ry,</HI>
and the like, began to flouri&s;h. All the Counties round felt
the Profit, the Poor were &s;et to Work, the Traders gain'd Wealth,
and Multitudes of People flock'd to the &s;everal Parts where the&s;e
Manufactures were erected for Employment, and the Growth of
<HI>England,</HI> both in Trade, Wealth and People &s;ince that time, as it
is well known to this Honourable Hou&s;e; &s;o the Cau&s;es of it ap|pear
to be plainly the Introducing of the&s;e Manufactures, and no|thing
el&s;e.</P>
<P>Nor was the Gain made here by it more vi&s;ible than the lo&s;s to
the <HI>Flemings,</HI> from hence, and not as is vainly &s;ugge&s;ted from
the building the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fort of <HI>Lilto</HI> on the <HI>Scheld,</HI> came the De|cay
of that flouri&s;hing City of <HI>Antwerp.</HI> From hence it is plain
the <HI>Flemings,</HI> an Indu&s;trious Nation, finding their Trade ruin'd
at once, turn'd their Hands to other things, as making of <HI>Lace,
Linnen,</HI> and the like, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> to the Sea Affairs and Fi&s;h|ing.</P>
<P>From hence they become <HI>Poor,</HI> thin of People, and <HI>weak</HI> in
Trade, the Flux both of their Wealth and Trade, running
wholly into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I humbly crave leave to lay, this long Introduction &s;hall not be
thought u&s;ele&s;s, when I &s;hall bring it home by the Proce&s;s of the&s;e
Papers to the Subject now in hand, <HI>viz. The Providing for and
Employing the Poor.</HI></P>
<P>Since the Times of <HI>Queen Elizabeth</HI> this Nation has gone on to
a Prodigy of Trade, of which the Encrea&s;e of our Cu&s;toms
from 400000 Crowns to two Millions of Pounds Sterling, <HI>per Ann.</HI>
is a Demon&s;tration beyond the Power of Argument; and that this
whole Encrea&s;e depends upon, and is principally occa&s;ion'd by the
encrea&s;e of our Manufactures is &s;o plain, I &s;hall not take up any
room here to make it out.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8">
Having thus given an Account how we came to be a rich, flou|ri&s;hing
and populous Nation, I crave leave as conci&s;ely as I can to
examine how we came to be Poor again, if it mu&s;t be granted that
we are &s;o.</P>
<P>By Poor here I humbly de&s;ire to be under&s;tood, not that we
are a poor Nation in general; I &s;hould undervalue the bounty of
Heaven to <HI>England,</HI> and act with le&s;s Under&s;tanding than mo&s;t
Men are Ma&s;ters of, if I &s;hould not own, that in general we are <HI>as
Rich a Nation</HI> as any in the World; but by Poor I mean burthen'd
with a crowd of clamouring, unimploy'd, unprovided for poor
People, who make the Nation unea&s;ie, burthen the Rich, clog our
Pari&s;hes, and make them&s;elves worthy of Laws, and peculiar
Management to di&s;po&s;e of and direct them how the&s;e came to be
thus is the Qu$&s;tion.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t I humbly crave leave to lay the&s;e Heads down as
fundamental Maxims, which I am ready at any time to Defend
and make out.</P>
<P>1. There is in <HI>England</HI> more Labour than Hands to perform it, and
con&s;equently a want of People, not of Employment.</P>
<P>2. No Man in <HI>England,</HI> of &s;ound Limbs and Sen&s;es, can be Poor meer|ly
for want of Work.</P>
<P>3. All our Work-hou&s;es, Corporations and Charities for employing the
Poor, and &s;etting them to Work, as now they are employ'd, or any
Acts of Parliament to empower Over&s;eers of Pari&s;hes, or Pari&s;hes
them&s;elves, to employ the Poor, except as &s;hall be hereafter excepted,
are, and will be publick Nau&s;ances, Mi&s;chiefs to the Nation which
&s;erve to the Ruin of Families, and the Encrea&s;e of the Poor.</P>
<P>4. That 'tis a Regulation of the Poor that is wanted in <HI>England,</HI> not
a &s;etting them to Work.</P>
<P>If after the&s;e things are made out, I am enquir'd of what this
Regulation &s;hould be, I am no more at a lo&s;s to lay it down than I
am to affirm what is above; and &s;hall always be ready, when call'd
to it, to make &s;uch a Propo&s;al to this Honourable Hou&s;e, as with
their Concurrence &s;hall for ever put a &s;top to Poverty and Beg|gery,
Pari&s;h Charges, A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments and the like, in this Nation.</P>
<P>If &s;uch offers as the&s;e &s;hall be &s;lighted and rejected, I have the
Satisfaction of having di&s;charg'd my Duty, and the Con&s;equence
mu&s;t be, that complaining will be continued in our Streets.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9">
'Tis my misfortune, that while I &s;tudy to make every Head &s;o
conci&s;e, as becomes me in things to be brought before &s;o Honoura|ble
and Augu&s;t an A&s;&s;embly, I am oblig'd to be &s;hort upon Heads
that in their own Nature would very well admit of particular Vo|lumes
to explain them.</P>
<P>1. I affirm, <HI>That in</HI> England <HI>there is more Labour than Hands
to perform it.</HI> This I prove,</P>
<P><HI>I&s;t.</HI> From the dearne&s;s of Wages, which in <HI>England</HI> out goes
all Nations in the World; and <HI>I know no greater Demon&s;tration in
Trade.</HI> Wages, like Exchanges, Ri&s;e and Fall as the Remitters
and Drawers, the Employers and the Work-men, Ballance one
another.</P>
<P>The Employers are the Remitters, the Work-men are the Draw|ers,
if there are more Employers than Work-men, the price of
Wages mu&s;t Ri&s;e, becau&s;e the Employer wants that Work to be
done more than the Poor Man wants to do it, if there are more
Work-men than Employers the price of Labour falls, becau&s;e the
Poor Man wants his Wages more than the Employer wants to
have his Bu&s;ine&s;s done.</P>
<P>Trade, like all Nature, mo&s;t ob&s;equiou&s;ly obeys the great Law
of Cau&s;e and Con&s;equence; and this is the occa&s;ion why even all
the greate&s;t Articles of Trade follow, and as it were pay Homage
to this &s;eemingly Minute and Incon&s;iderable Thing, <HI>The poor
Man's Labour.</HI></P>
<P>I omit, with &s;ome pain, the many very u&s;eful Thoughts that
occur on this Head, to pre&s;erve the Brevity I owe to the Dignity
of that A&s;&s;embly I am writing to. But I cannot but Note how
from hence it appears, that the Glory, the Strength, the Riches,
the Trade, and all that's valuable in a Nation, as to its Figure in
the World, depends upon the Number of its People, be they ne|ver
&s;o mean or poor; the con&s;umption of Manufacturers encrea&s;es
the Manufacturers; the number of Manufacturers encrea&s;es the
Con&s;umption; Provi&s;ions are con&s;um'd to feed them, Land Im|prov'd,
and more Hands employ'd to furni&s;h Provi&s;ion: All the
Wealth of the Nation, and all the Trade is produc'd by Num|bers
of People; but of this by the way.</P>
<P>The price of Wages not only determines the Difference between
the Employer and the Work-man, but it rules the Rates of every
Market. If Wages grows high, Provi&s;ions ri&s;e in Proportion, and
<PB N="11" REF="10">
I humbly conceive it to be a mi&s;take in tho&s;e People, who &s;ay La|bour
in &s;uch parts of <HI>England</HI> is cheap becau&s;e Provi&s;ions are cheap,
but 'tis plain, Provi&s;ions are cheap there becau&s;e Labour is cheap,
and Labour is cheaper in tho&s;e Parts than in others; becau&s;e being
remoter from <HI>London</HI> there is not that extraordinary Di&s;proportion
between the Work and the Number of Hands; there are more
Hands, and con&s;equently Labour cheaper.</P>
<P>'Tis plain to any ob&s;erving Eye, that there is an equal plenty
of Provi&s;ions in &s;everal of our South and We&s;tern Counties, as in
<HI>York&s;hire,</HI> and rather a greater, and I believe I could make it out,
that a poor labouring Man may live as cheap in <HI>Kent</HI> or <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> as in
the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Durham;</HI> and yet in <HI>Kent</HI> a poor Man &s;hall earn
7 <HI>s. 10 s. 9 s.</HI> a Week, and in the North 4 <HI>s.</HI> or perhaps le&s;s; the
difference is plain in this, that in <HI>Kent</HI> there is a greater want of
People, in Proportion to the Work there, than in the North.</P>
<P>And this on the other hand makes the People of our northen
Countries &s;pread them&s;elves &s;o much to the South, where Trade, War
and the Sea carrying off &s;o many, there is a greater want of Hands.</P>
<P>And yet 'tis plain there is Labour for the Hands which remain
in the North, or el&s;e the Country would be depopulated, and the
People come all away to the South to &s;eek Work; and even in <HI>York|&s;hire,</HI>
where Labour is cheape&s;t, the People can gain more by their
Labour than in any of the Manufacturing Countries of <HI>Germany,
Italy</HI> or <HI>France,</HI> and live much better.</P>
<P>If there was one poor Man in <HI>England</HI> more than there was Work
to employ, either &s;omebody el&s;e mu&s;t &s;tand &s;till for him, or he
mu&s;t be &s;tarv'd; if another Man &s;tands &s;till for him he wants a
days Work, and goes to &s;eek it, and by con&s;equence &s;upplants a|nother,
and this a third, and this Contention brings it to this;
no &s;ays the poor Man, <HI>That is like to be put out of his Work,</HI> rather
than that Man &s;hall come in I'll do it cheaper; nay, &s;ays the other,
but I'll do it cheaper than you; and thus one poor Man wanting
but a Days work would bring down the price of Labour in a
whole Nation, for the Man cannot &s;tarve, and will work for any
thing rather than want it.</P>
<P>It may be Objected here, This is contradicted by our Number
of Beggars.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry to &s;ay I am oblig'd here to call begging an Employ|ment,
&s;ince 'tis plain, if there is more Wor$ than Hands to perform
<PB N="12" REF="11">
it, no Man that has his <HI>Limbs</HI> and his <HI>Sen&s;es</HI> need to beg, and tho&s;e
that <HI>have not</HI> ought to be put into a Condition not to want it.</P>
<P>So that begging is a meer &s;candal in the General, <HI>in the Able</HI> 'tis
a &s;candal upon their Indu&s;try, and <HI>in the Impotent</HI> 'tis a &s;candal
upon the Country.</P>
<P>Nay, the begging, as now practic'd, is a &s;candal upon our Cha|rity,
and perhaps the foundation of all our pre&s;ent Grievance&mdash;How
can it be po&s;&s;ible that any Man or Woman, who being
found in Body and Mind, may as 'tis apparent they may, have
Wages for their Work, &s;hould be &s;o ba&s;e, &s;o meanly &s;pirited, as
to beg an Alms for God-&s;ake&mdash;Truly the &s;candal lies on our
Charity; and People have &s;uch a Notion in <HI>England</HI> of being pit|tiful
and charitable, that they encourage Vagrants, and by a mi|&s;taken
Zeal do more harm than good.</P>
<P>This is a large Scene, and much might be &s;aid upon it; I &s;hall
abridge it as much as po&s;&s;ible&mdash;. The Poverty of <HI>England</HI> does
not lye among the craving Beggars but among poor Families,
where the Children are numerous, and where Death or Sickne&s;s
has depriv'd them of the Labour of the Father; the&s;e are the
Hou&s;es that the Sons and Daughters of Charity, if they would or|der
it well, &s;hould &s;eek out and relieve; an Alms ill directed may
be Charity to the particular Per&s;on, but becomes an Injury to the
Publick, and no Charity to the Nation. As for the craving Poor,
I am per&s;waded I do them no wrong when I &s;ay, that if they
were Incorporated they would be the riche&s;t Society in the Na|tion;
and the rea&s;on why &s;o many pretend to want Work is, that
they can live &s;o well with the pretence of wanting Work, they
would be mad to leave it and Work in earne&s;t; and I affim of my
own knowledge, when I have wanted a Man for labouring work,
and offer'd 95. <HI>per</HI> Week to &s;trouling Fellows at my Door, they
have frequently told me to my Face, they could get more a beg|ging,
and I once &s;et a lu&s;ty Fellow in the Stocks for making the
Experiment.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, in its proper place, bring this to a Method of Tryal,
&s;ince nothing but Demon&s;tration will affect us, 'tis an ea&s;ie matter
to prevent begging in <HI>England,</HI> and yet to maintain all our Impo|tent
Poor at far le&s;s charge to the Pari&s;hes than they now are ob|lig'd
to be at.</P>
<P>When Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> had gain'd her Point as to Manufactories
<PB N="13" REF="12">
in <HI>England,</HI> &s;he had fairly laid the Foundation, &s;he thereby found
out the way how every Family might live upon their own Labour,
like a wi&s;e Prince&s;s &s;he knew 'twould be hard to force People to
Work when there was nothing for them to turn their Hands to;
but a&s;&s;oon as &s;he had brought the matter to bear, and there was
Work for every body that had no mind to &s;tarve, then &s;he apply'd
her &s;elf to make Laws to oblige the People to do this Work, and
to puni&s;h Vagrants, and make every one live by their own La|bour;
all her Succe&s;&s;ors followed this laudable Example, and from
hence came all tho&s;e Laws again&s;t &s;turdy Beggars, Vagabounds,
Stroulers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which had they been &s;everely put in Execution by
our Magi&s;trates, 'tis pre&s;um'd the&s;e Vagrant Poor had not &s;o en|creas'd
upon us as they have.</P>
<P>And it &s;eems &s;trange to me, from what ju&s;t Ground we proceed
now upon other Methods, and fancy that 'tis now our Bu&s;ine&s;s to
find them Work, and to Employ them rather than to oblige them
to find them&s;elves Work and go about it.</P>
<P>From this mi&s;taken Notion come all our Work-hou&s;es and Cor|porations,
and the &s;ame Error, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, I pre&s;ume was
the birth of this Bill now depending, which enables every Pari&s;h
to erect the Woollen Manufacture within it &s;elf, for the employ|ing
their own Poor.</P>
<P>'Tis the mi&s;take of this part of the Bill only which I am en|quiring
into, and which I endeavour to &s;et in a true light.</P>
<P>In all the Parliaments &s;ince the Revolution, this Matter has
been before them, and I am ju&s;tified in this attempt by the Hou&s;e
of Commons having frequently appointed Committees to receive
Propo&s;als upon this Head.</P>
<P>As my Propo&s;al is General, I pre&s;ume to offer it to the Gene|ral
Body of the Hou&s;e; if I am commanded to explain any part
of it, I am ready to do any thing that may be &s;erviceable to this
great and noble De&s;ign.</P>
<P>As the former Hou&s;es of Commons gave all po&s;&s;ible Encou|ragement
to &s;uch as could offer, or but pretend to offer at
this needful thing, &s;o the imperfect E&s;&s;ays of &s;everal, whether for
private or publick Benefit. I do not attempt to determine which
have &s;ince been made, and which have obtain'd the Powers and
Conditions they have de&s;ir'd, have by all their Effects demon&s;tra|ted
the weakne&s;s of their De&s;ign; and that they either under&s;tood
<PB N="14" REF="13">
not the Di&s;ea&s;e, or know not the proper Cure for it.</P>
<P>The Imperfection of all the&s;e Attempts is acknowledg'd, not
only in the Preamble of this new Act of Parliament, but even in
the thing, in that there is yet occa&s;ion for any new Law.</P>
<P>And having &s;urvey'd, not the nece&s;&s;ity of a new Act, but the
Contents of the Act which has been propos'd as a Remedy in this
Ca&s;e; I cannot but offer my Objections again&s;t the Sufficiency of
the Propo&s;al, and leave it to the Con&s;ideration of this Wi&s;e A&s;|&s;embly,
and of the whole Nation.</P>
<P>I humbly hope the Learned Gentlemen, under who&s;e Dire|ction
this Law is now to proceed, and by who&s;e Order it has
been Printed, will not think him&s;elf per&s;onally concern'd in this
Ca&s;e, his Endeavours to promote &s;o good a Work, as the Re|lief,
Employment, and Settlement of the Poor merit the Thanks
and Acknowledgment of the whole Nation, and no Man &s;hall
be more ready to pay his &s;hare of that Debt to him than my &s;elf.
But if his Scheme happen to be &s;omething &s;uperficial, if he comes.
in among the number of tho&s;e who have not &s;earch'd this Wound
to the bottom, if the Methods propos'd are not &s;uch as will either
an&s;wer his own De&s;igns or the Nations, I cannot think my &s;elf ob|lig'd
to di&s;pen&s;e, with my Duty to the Publick Good, to pre|&s;erve
a Per&s;onal Value for his Judgment, tho' the Gentleman's
Merit be extraordinary.</P>
<P>Wherefore, as in all the Schemes I have &s;een laid for the Poor,
and in this Act now before your Honourable Hou&s;e; the general
Thought of the Propo&s;ers runs upon the Employing the Poor by
Work-hou&s;es, Corporations, Hou&s;es of Correction, and the
like, and that I think it plain to be &s;een, that tho&s;e Propo&s;als come
va&s;tly &s;hort of the main De&s;ign. The&s;e Sheets are humbly laid
before you, as well to make good what is alledg'd, <HI>viz.</HI> That
all the&s;e Work-hou&s;es, &amp;c. Tend to the Encrea&s;e, and not the
Relief of the Poor, as to make an humble Tender of mean plain,
but I hope, rational Propo&s;als for the more effectual Cure of this
grand Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>In order to proceed to this great Challenge, I humbly de&s;ire
the Bills already pa&s;s'd may be review'd, the Practice of our Cor|poration
Work-hou&s;es, and the Contents of this propo&s;ed Act
examin'd.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14">
In all the&s;e it will appear that the Method chiefly propo&s;ed
for the Employment of our Poor, is by &s;etting them to Work on
the &s;everal Manufactures before mention'd; as <HI>Spinning, Weaving,</HI>
and Manufacturing our <HI>Engli&s;h Wool.</HI></P>
<P>All our Work-hou&s;es, lately Erected in <HI>England;</HI> are in gene|ral
thus Employ'd, for which without enumerating Particulars,
I humbly appeal to the Knowledge of the &s;everal Members of this
Honourable Hou&s;e in their re&s;pective Towns where &s;uch Corpo|rations
have been erected.</P>
<P><HI>In the pre&s;ent Act now preparing, as Printed by Direction of
a Member of this Honourable Hou&s;e, it appears,</HI> that in order to
&s;et the Poor to Work, it &s;hall be Lawful for the Over&s;eers of <HI>every
Town,</HI> or of one or more <HI>Towns joyn'd together to</HI> occupy any
Trade, My&s;tery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And rai&s;e Stocks for the carrying them on for
the &s;etting the Poor at Work, and for the purcha&s;ing Wool, Iron,
Hemp, Flax, Thread, or other Materials for that Purpo&s;e. Vide
the Act Publi&s;h'd by Sir <HI>Humphry Mackworth.</HI></P>
<P>And that Charities given &s;o and &s;o, and not exceeding <HI>zool$
per Annum</HI> for this Purpo&s;e, &s;hall be Incorporated of Cour&s;e for
the&s;e Ends.</P>
<P>In order now to come to the Ca&s;e in hand, <HI>it is nece&s;&s;ary to
premi&s;e,</HI> that the thing now in debate is not the Poor of this or that
particular Town. The Hou&s;e of Commons are acting like them|&s;elves,
as they are the Repre&s;entatives of all the Commons of
<HI>England,</HI> 'tis the Care of all the Poor of <HI>England</HI> which lies be|fore
them, not of this or that particular Body of the Poor.</P>
<P>In proportion to this great Work; I am to be under&s;tood that
the&s;e Work-hou&s;es, Hou&s;es of Correction, and Stocks to Em|ploy
the Poor may be granted to le&s;&s;en the Poor in this or that
particular part of <HI>England;</HI> and we are particularly told of that
at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> that it has been &s;uch a Terror to the Beggars that none
of the &s;touling Crew will come near the City. But all this al|low'd,
in general, 'twill be felt in the main, and the end will be
au Encrea&s;e of our Poor.</P>
<P>1. The Manufactures that the&s;e Gentlemen Employ the Poor
upon, are all &s;uch as are before exercis'd in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>2. They are all &s;uch as are manag'd to a full Extent, and the
pre&s;ent Accidents of War and Forreign Interruption of Trade
con&s;ider'd rather beyond the vent of them than under it.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15">
Suppo&s;e now a Work-hou&s;e for Employment of Poor Children,
&s;ets them to &s;pinning of Wor&s;ted.&mdash;For every Skein of Wor&s;ted
the&s;e Poor Children Spin, there mu&s;t be a Skein the le&s;s Spun by
&s;ome poor Family or Per&s;on that &s;pun it before; &s;uppo&s;e the Ma|nufacture
of making Bays to be erected in <HI>Bi&s;hopsgate-&s;treet,</HI> unle&s;s
the Makers of the&s;e Bays can at the &s;ame time find out a Trade or
Con&s;umption for more Bays than were made before. For every
piece of Bays &s;o made in <HI>London</HI> there mu&s;t be a Piece the le&s;s made
at <HI>$word$.</HI></P>
<P>I humbly appeal to the Honourable Hou&s;e of Commons what
this may be call'd, and with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, I think it is nothing at all
to Employing the Poor, &s;ince 'tis only the tran&s;po&s;ing the Manu|facture
from $word$ to <HI>London,</HI> and taking the Bread out of
the Mouths of the Poor of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> to put it into the Mouths of the
I'cor of <HI>$word$.</HI></P>
<P>If the&s;e worthy Gentlemen, who &s;how them&s;elves &s;o commen|dably
forward to Relieve and Employ the Poor, will find out &s;ome
new Trade, &s;ome new Market, where the Goods they make &s;hall
be &s;old, where none of the &s;ame Goods were &s;old before; if they
will &s;end them to any place where they &s;hall not interfere with the
re&s;t of that Manufacture, or with &s;ome other made in <HI>England,</HI>
then indeed they will do &s;omething worthy of them&s;elves, and
may employ the Poor to the &s;ame glorious Advantage as Queen
<HI>$word$</HI> did, to whom this Nation, as a trading Country, owes
its peculiar Greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>If the&s;e Gentlemen could e&s;tabli&s;h a Trade to <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> for <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
Serges, or obtain an Order from the <HI>Czar,</HI> that all his Sub|jects
&s;hould wear Stockings who wore none before, every poor
Child's Labour in Spining and Knitting tho&s;e Stockings, and all the
Wool in them would be clear gain to the Nation and the general
Stock would be improved by it, becau&s;e all the growth of our
Country, and all the Labour of a Per&s;on who was Idle before, is
&s;o much clear Gain to the General Stock.</P>
<P>If they $word$ Employ the Poor in &s;ome Manufacture which was
no. made in <HI>England</HI> before, or not bought with &s;ome. Manufacture
made here before, then they offer at &s;omething extraordinary.</P>
<P>But to &s;et Poor People at Work, on the &s;ame thing which o|ther
poor People were employ'd on before, and at the &s;ame time
$word$ the Con&s;umption, is giving to one what you take
<PB N="17" REF="16">
away from another; enriching one poor Man to &s;tarve another,
putting a Vagabond into an hone&s;t Man's Employment, and put|ting
his Diligence on the Tenters to find out &s;ome other Work to
maintain his Family.</P>
<P>As this is not at all profitable, &s;o <HI>with Sabmi&s;&s;ion for the Expre&s;|&s;ion,</HI>
I cannot &s;ay 'tishone&s;t, becau&s;e 'tis tran&s;planting and carry|ing
the poor Peoples Lawful Employment from the Place where
was their Lawful Settlement, and the hard&s;hip of this <HI>our Law
con&s;ider'd</HI> is intolerable. For Example.</P>
<P>The Manufacture of making Bays is now E&s;tabli&s;h'd at <HI>Col|che&s;ter</HI>
in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> &s;uppo&s;e it &s;hould be attempted to be Etected in
<HI>Middle&s;ex,</HI> as a certain Worthy and Wealthy Gentleman near
<HI>Hackney</HI> once propos'd, it may be &s;uppos'd if you will grant the
Skill in Working the &s;ame, and the Wages the &s;ame, that they
mu&s;t be made cheaper in <HI>Middle&s;ex</HI> than in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and cheapne&s;s
certainly will make the Merchant buy here rather than there, and
&s;o in time all the Bay making at <HI>Colche&s;ter</HI> Dyes, and the Staple
for that Commodity is temov'd &s;o <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>What mu&s;t the Poor of <HI>Colche&s;ter</HI> do, there they buy a Paro|chial
Settlement, tho&s;e that have numerous Families cannot fol|low
the Manufacture and come up to <HI>London,</HI> for our Parochial
Laws Impower the Church wardens to refu&s;e them a Settlement,
&s;o that they are con&s;in'd to their own Countrey, and the Bread
taken out of their Mouths, and all this to feed Vegabonds, and
to &s;et them to Work, who by their choice would be idle, and
who merit the Correction of the Law.</P>
<P>There is another Grievance which I &s;hall endeavour to touch at,
which every Man that wi&s;hes well to the Poor does not fore&s;ee, and
which, with humble Submi&s;&s;ion to the Gentlemen that contriv'd
this Act, I &s;ee no notice taken of.</P>
<P>There are Arcanas in Trade, which though they are the Na|tural
Con&s;equences of Time and ca&s;ual Circum&s;tances, are yet
become now &s;o E&s;&s;ential to the Publick Benefit, that to alter or
di&s;order, them would be an irreparable Damage to the Publick.</P>
<P>I &s;hall explain my &s;elf as conci&s;ely as I can.</P>
<P>The Manufactures of <HI>England</HI> are happily &s;ettled in different
Corners of the Kingdom, from whence they are mutually con|vey'd
by a Circulation of Trade to <HI>London</HI> by Whole&s;ale, like the
Blood to the Heart, and from thence di&s;per&s;e in le&s;&s;er quantities
<PB N="18" REF="17">
to the other parts of the Kingdom by Retail. For Example.</P>
<P>Serges are made at <HI>Exeter, Taunton,</HI> &amp;c. Stuffs at <HI>Norwich; Bays,
Sayes, Shaloons,</HI> &amp;c. at <HI>Colche&s;ter, Bocking, Sudbury,</HI> and Parts adjacent,
Fine Cloath in <HI>Somer&s;et, Wilts, Glouce&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Wer$e &s;ter&s;hire,</HI> Cour&s;e
Cloath is <HI>Tork&s;hire, Kent, Surry,</HI> &amp;c. Druggets at <HI>Farnham, New|bury,</HI>
&amp;c. All the&s;e &s;end up the Gro&s;s of their Quantity to <HI>London,</HI>
and receive each others Sorts in Retail for their own u&s;e again.
<HI>Norwich</HI> Buys <HI>Exeter</HI> Serges, <HI>Exeter</HI> Buys <HI>Norwich</HI> Stuffs; all at
<HI>London, York&s;hire</HI> Buys Fine Cloths, and <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> Cour&s;e, &s;till at
<HI>London;</HI> and the like, of a va&s;t Variety of our Manufactures.</P>
<P>By this Exchange of Manufactures abundance of Trading Fa|milies
are maintain'd by the Carriage and Re-carriage of Goods,
vaft number of Men and Cattle are employed, and numbers of
Inholders, Victuallers, and their Dependencies &s;ub&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>And on this account I cannot but ob&s;erve to your Honours, and
'tis well worth your Con&s;ideration, that the already Tran&s;po&s;ing
a va&s;t Woollen Manufacture from &s;everal Parts of <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
is a manifeft detriment to Trade in general, the &s;everal Wool.
len Goods now made in <HI>Spittle&s;ields,</HI> where within this few Years
were none at all made, has already vi&s;ibly affected the &s;everal Parts,
where they were before made, as <HI>Norwich, Sudbury, Farnham,</HI>
and other Towns, many of who&s;e Principal Trade&s;men are now
remov'd hither, employ their Stocks here, employ the Poor here,
and leave the Poor of tho&s;e Countries to &s;hift for Work.</P>
<P>This Breach of the Circulation of Trade mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily Di|temper
the Body, and I crave leave to give an Example or two.</P>
<P>I'll pre&s;ume to give an Example in Trade, which perhaps the
Gentlemen concern'd in this Bill may, without Reflection upon
their knowledge, be ignorant of.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Norwich,</HI> and parts adjacent, were for &s;ome Ages
employ'd in the Manufactures of Stuffs and Stockings.</P>
<P>The Latter Trade, which was once con&s;iderable, is in a man|ner
wholly tran&s;pos'd into <HI>London,</HI> by the va&s;t quanties of wor&s;t|ed
Ho&s;e Wove by the Frame, which is a Trade within this 10
Years almo&s;t wholly new.</P>
<P>Now as the knitting Frame perform that in a Day which would
otherwi&s;e employ a poor Woman eight or ten Days, by con&s;e|quence
a few Frames perform'd the Work of many Thou&s;and poor
People: and the Con&s;umption being not increa&s;ed, the Effect im|mediately
<PB N="19" REF="18">
appear'd; &s;o many Stockings as were made in <HI>London</HI> &s;o
many the fewer were demanded from <HI>Norwich,</HI> till in a few Years
the Manufacture there wholly funk, the Ma&s;ters there turn'd their
hands to other Bu&s;ine&s;s; and whereas the Ho&s;e Trade from <HI>Nor|folk</HI>
once return'd at lea&s;t 5000 <HI>s. per</HI> Week, and as &s;ome &s;ay twice
that Sum, 'tis not now worth naming.</P>
<P>'Tis in fewer Years, and near our Memory, that of <HI>Spittle-fields</HI>
Men have fallen into another branch of the <HI>Norwich</HI> Trade, <HI>viz.</HI>
making of Stuffs, Drugets, &amp;c.</P>
<P>If any Man &s;ay the People of <HI>Norfolk</HI> are yet full of Employ, and
do not Work; and &s;ome have been &s;o weak as to make that Re|ply,
avoiding the many other Demon&s;trations which could be gi|ven,
this is pa&s;t an&s;wering, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Combers of Wool in
<HI>Norfolk</HI> and <HI>Suffolk,</HI> who formerly had all, or ten Parts in eleven
of their Yarn Manufactur'd in the Country, now comb their
Wool indeed, and &s;pin the Yarn in the Country, but &s;end va&s;t
Quanties of it to <HI>London</HI> to be woven; will any Man que&s;tion
whether this be not a Lo&s;s to <HI>Norwich;</HI> Can there be as many Wea|vers
as before? And are there not abundance of Work-men and
Ma&s;ters too remov'd to <HI>London?</HI></P>
<P>If it be &s;o at <HI>Norwich, Canterbury</HI> is yet more a melancholy In|&s;tance
of it, where the Hou&s;es &s;tand empty, and the People go
off, and the Trade dye, becau&s;e the Weavers are follow'd the Ma|nufacture
to <HI>London;</HI> and whereas there was within few Years 200
broad Looms at Work, I am well a&s;&s;ur'd there are not 50 now
Employ'd in that City.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Effects of tran&s;po&s;ing Manufactures, and inter|rupting
the Circulation of Trade.</P>
<P>All Methods to bring our Trade to be manag'd by fewer hands
than it was before, are in them&s;elves pernicious to <HI>England</HI> in gene|ral,
as it le&s;&s;ens the Employment of the Poor, unhinges their
Hands from the Labour, and tends to bring our Hands to be &s;u|perior
$o our Employ, which as yet it is not.</P>
<P>In <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire</HI> there always has been a very con|&s;iderable
Manufacture for Stockings, at <HI>Colche&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Sudbury</HI> for
Bayes, Sayes, &amp;c. mo&s;t of the Wool the&s;e Countries u&s;e is bought
at <HI>London,</HI> and carried down into tho&s;e Counties, and then the
Goods being Manufactur'd are brought back to <HI>London</HI> to Market;
upon tran&s;po&s;ing the Manufacture as before, all the poor People
<PB N="20" REF="19">
and all the Cattel who hitherto were Employ'd in that <HI>Voiture,</HI> are
immediately disbanded by their Country, the Inkeepers on the
Roads mu&s;t Decay, &s;o much Land lye for other u&s;es, as the Cattle
Employ'd, Hou&s;es and Tenement on the Roads, and all their De|pendencies
&s;ink in Value.</P>
<P>'Tis hard to calculate what a blow it would be to Trade in ge|neral,
&s;hould every County but Manufacture all the &s;everal &s;orts
of Goods they u&s;e, it would throw our Inland Trade into &s;trange
Convul&s;ions, which at pre&s;ent is perhaps, or has been, in the great|e&s;t
Regularity of any in the World.</P>
<P>What &s;trange Work mu&s;t it then make when every Town &s;hall
have a Manufacture, and every Pari&s;h be a Ware-hou&s;e; Trade
will be burthen'd with Corporations, which are generally equally
de&s;tructive as Monopolies, and by this Method will ea&s;ily be made &s;o</P>
<P>Pari&s;h Stocks, under the Direction of Ju&s;tices of Peace, may &s;oon
come to &s;et up petty Manufactures, and here &s;hall all u&s;eful things
be made, and all the poorer &s;ort of People &s;hall be aw'd or bya&s;s'd
to Trade there only. Thus the Shop-keepers, who pay Taxes.
and are the Support of our inland Circulation, will immediately
be ruin'd, and thus we &s;hall beggar the Nation to provide for the
Poor.</P>
<P>As this will make every Pari&s;h a Market Town, and every Ho&s;|pital
a Store-hou&s;e, &s;o in <HI>London,</HI> and the adjacent Parts, to which
va&s;t quantities of the Woollen Manufacture will be thus tran&s;plan|ted
thither, will in time too great and di&s;proportion'd Numbers
of the People a&s;&s;emble.</P>
<P>Tho' the &s;ettled Poor can't remove, yet &s;ingle People will &s;trou
about and follow the Manufacturer; and thus in time &s;uch va&s;t
numbers will be drawn about <HI>London,</HI> as may be inconvenient to the
Government, and e&s;pecially Depopulating to tho&s;e Countries where
the numbers of People, by rea&s;on of the&s;e Manufactures are very
con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>An eminent In&s;tance of this we have in the pre&s;ent, Trade to <HI>Mu
covy,</HI> which however de&s;ign'd for an Improvement to the <HI>English</HI>
Nation, and boa&s;ted of as &s;uch, appears to be Converted into a Mo|nopoly,
and proves Injurious and De&s;tructive to the Nation. The
Per&s;ons concern'd removing and carrying out our People to teach
that unpoli&s;h'd Nation the Improvements they are capable of</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20">
If the bringing the <HI>Flemings</HI> to <HI>England</HI> brought with them their
Manufacture and Trade, carrying our People abroad, e&s;pecially
to a Country where the People work for little or nothing, what
may it not do towards In&s;tructing that populous Nation in &s;uch
Manufactures as may in time tend to the de&s;truction of our
Trade, or the reducing our Manufacture to an Abatement in Va|lue,
which will be felt at home by an abatement of Wages, and
that in Provi&s;ions, and that in Rent of Land; and &s;o the general
Stock &s;inks of Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>But as this is preparing, by eminent Hands, to be laid before
this Hou&s;e as a Grievance meriting your Care and Concern, I
omit in&s;i&s;ting on it here.</P>
<P>And this removing of People is attended with many Inconveni|encies
which are not ea&s;ily perceived, as</P>
<P>1. The immediate fall of the Value of all Lands in tho&s;e Coun|tries
where the Manufactures were before; for as the numbers of
People, by the Con&s;umption of Provi&s;ions, mu&s;t where ever they
encrea&s;e make Rents ri&s;e, and Lands valuable; &s;o tho&s;e People
removing, tho' the Provi&s;ions would, if po&s;&s;ible, follow them,
yet the Price of them mu&s;t fall by all that Charge they are at for
Carriage, and con&s;equently; Lands mu&s;t fall in Proportion.</P>
<P>2. This Tran&s;planting of Families, in time, would introduce
great and new Alterations in the Countries they removed to, which
as they would be to the Profit of &s;ome Places, would be to the De|triment
of others, and can by no means be ju&s;t any more than it
is convenient; for no wi&s;e Government &s;tudies to put any Branch
of their Country to any particular Di&s;advantages, tho' it may be
found in the general Account in another Place.</P>
<P>If it be fair where will be Manufactures in every Pari&s;h, and that
will keep the People at home,</P>
<P>I humbly repre&s;ent what &s;trange Confu&s;ion and particular De|triment
to the general Circulation of Trade <HI>mention'd before</HI> it mu&s;t
be, to have every Pari&s;h makes its own Manufactures.</P>
<P>1. It will make our Towns and Counties independent of one
another, and put a damp to Corre&s;pondence, which all will allow
to be a great Motive of Trade in general.</P>
<P>2. It will fill us with various &s;orts and kinds of Manufactures,
by which our &s;tated &s;orts of Goods will in time dwindle away in
Reputation, and Foreigners not know them one from another
<PB N="22" REF="21">
Our &s;everal Manufactures are known by their re&s;pective Names;
and our Serges, Bayes and other Goods, are bought abroad by the
Character and Reputation of the Places where they are made;
when there &s;hall come new and unheard of Kinds to Market,
&s;ome better, &s;ome wor&s;e, as to be&s;ure new Undertakers will vary
in kinds, the Dignity and Reputation of the <HI>English</HI> Goods abroad
will be lo&s;t, and &s;o many Confu&s;ions in Trade mu&s;t follow, as are
too many to repeat.</P>
<P>3. Either our Pari&s;h-&s;tock mu&s;t &s;ell by Whole&s;ale or by Retail,
or both; If the fir&s;t 'tis doubted they will make &s;orry work of it,
and having other Bu&s;ine&s;s of their own make but poor Merchants;
it by Retail, then they turn Pedlars, will be a publick nu&s;ance
to Trade, and at la&s;t quite ruin it.</P>
<P>4. This will ruin all the Carriers in <HI>England,</HI> the Wool will be
all Manufactured where it is &s;heer'd, every body will make their
own Cloaths, and the Trade which now lives by running thro'
a multitude of Hands, will go then through &s;o few, that thou&s;ands
of Families will want Employment, and this is the only way to
reduce us to the Condition &s;poken of, to have more Hands than
Work.</P>
<P>'Tis the excellence of our <HI>English</HI> Manufacture, that it is &s;o plant|ed
as to go thro' as many Hands as 'tis po&s;&s;ible; he that contrives
to have it go thro' &s;ever, ought at the &s;ame time to provide Work
for the re&s;t&mdash;As it is it Employs a great multitude of People, and
can employ more; but if a con&s;iderable number of the&s;e People
be unhing'd from their Employment, it cannot but be detrimen|tal
to the whole.</P>
<P>When I &s;ay we could employ more People in <HI>England,</HI> I do not
mean that we cannot do our Work with tho&s;e we have, but I
mean thus:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, It &s;hould be more People brought over from foreign Parts.
I do not mean that tho&s;e we have &s;hould be taken from all com|mon
Employments and put to our Manufacture; we may une|qually
di&s;po&s;e of our Hands, and &s;o have too many for &s;ome
Works, and too few for others; and 'tis plain that in &s;ome parts of
<HI>England</HI> it is &s;o, what el&s;e can be the rea&s;on, why in our Southern
Parts of <HI>England, Kent</HI> in particular, borrows 20000 People of
other Counties to get in her Harve&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="22">
But if more Forreigners came among us, if it were 2 Millions
it could do us no harm, becau&s;e they would con&s;ume our Provi|&s;ions,
and we have Land enough to produce much more than we
do, and they would con&s;ume our Manufactures, and we have
Wool enough for any Quantity.</P>
<P>I think therefore, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, to erect Manufactures in e|very
Town to tran&s;po&s;e the Manufactures from the &s;ettled places
into private Pari&s;hes and Corporations, to parcel out our Trade to
every Door, it mu&s;t be ruinous to the Manufacturers them&s;elves,
will turn thou&s;ands of Families out of their Employments, and
take the Bread out of the Mouths of diligent and indu&s;trious Fami|lies
to feed Vagrants, Thieves and Beggars, who ought much ra|ther
to be compell'd, by Legal Methods, to &s;eek that Work which
it is plain is to be had; and thus this Act will in&s;tead of &s;etting and
relieving the Poor, encrea&s;e their Number, and &s;tarve the be&s;t
of them.</P>
<P>It remains now, according to my fir&s;t Propo&s;al Page 9. to con|&s;ider
from whence proceeds the Poverty of our People, what Ac|cident,
what Decay of Trade, what want of Employment, what
&s;trange Revolution of Circum&s;tances makes our People Poor, and
con&s;equently Burthen&s;om, and our Laws Deficient, &s;o as to make
more and other Laws Requi&s;ite, and the Nation concerned to ap|ply
a Remedy to this growing Di&s;ea&s;e. I An&s;wer.</P>
<P>1. Not for want of Work; and be&s;ides what has been &s;aid on
that Head, I humbly de&s;ire the&s;e two things may be con&s;ider'd.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, 'Tis apparent, That if one Man, Woman, or Child, can
by his, or her Labour, earn more Money than will &s;ub&s;i&s;t one
body, there mu&s;t con&s;equently be no want of Work, &s;ince any
Man would Work for ju&s;t as much as would &s;upply him&s;elf rather
than &s;tarve&mdash;What a va&s;t difference then mu&s;t there be between
the Work and the Work-men, when 'tis now known that in <HI>Spit|tle-fields,</HI>
and other adjacent parts of the City, there is nothing
more frequent than for a journey-man Weaver, of many &s;orts, to
gain from 155. to 305. <HI>per</HI> Week Wages, and I appeal to the Silk
Throw&s;ters, whether they do not give 85. 95. and 105. <HI>per</HI> Week
to blind Men and Cripples, to turn Wheels, and do the meanelt
and mo&s;t ordinary Works.</P>

of Tile making from 165. to 205. <HI>per</HI> Week Wages, and
all that time would hardly have a pair of Shoes to his Feet, or

<P>The meane&s;t Labours in this Nation afford the Work-men &s;uf|ficient

be if there was a want of Work.</P>
<P>2. I humbly de&s;ire this Honourable Hou&s;e to con&s;ider the pre&s;ent
Difficulty of $word$ Solders in this Kingdom; the va&s;t Charge
the Kingdom is at to the Officers to produce Men; the many little
and no! <HI>over hone&s;t Methods</HI> made u&s;e of to bring them into the Ser|vice,
the Laws made to compel them; Why are Goals rumag'd for
Malefactors, and the Mint and Pri&s;ons for Debiors, the War is an
Employment of Honour, and &s;uffers &s;ome &s;candal in having Men
taken from the Gallows, and immediately from Villains and Hou&s;e|breakers
made Gentlemen Soldiers. If Men wanted Employ|ment,
and con&s;equently Bread, this could never be, any Man
would carry a Mu&s;quet rather than &s;tarve, and wear the
Queens Cloth, or any Bodies Cloth, rather than go Naked,
and live in Rags and want; 'tis plain the Nation is full of
People, and 'tis as plain our People have no particular aver&s;ion
to the War, but they are not poor enough to go abroad; 'tis Po|verty
makes Men Soldiers, and drives crowds into the Armies, and
the Difficulties to get <HI>English</HI>-men to Li&s;t is, becau&s;e they live in
Plenty and Ea&s;e, and he that can earn 205. <HI>per</HI> Week at an ea&s;ie,
&s;teady Employment, mu&s;t be Drunk or Mad when he Li&s;ts for
a Soldier, to be knock'd o'th'Head for 35. <HI>6d. per</HI> Week; but if
there was no Work to be had, if the Poor wanted Employment,
if they had not Bread to eat, nor knew not how to earn it, thou|&s;ands
of young lu&s;ty Fellows would fly to the Pike and Mu&s;quet,

From all the&s;e Particulars, and innumerable unhappy In&s;tances
which might be given, 'tis plain, the Poverty of our People
which is &s;o burthen&s;ome, and increa&s;es upon us &s;o much, does not
ari&s;e from want of proper Employments, and for want of Work,
or Employers, and con&s;equently,</P>

<P>The Poverty and Exigence of the Poor in <HI>England,</HI> is plainly

<Q>Ca&s;ualty <HI>or</HI> Crime.</Q>
<P>By Ca&s;ualty, I mean Sickne&s;s of Families, lo&s;s of Limbs or
Sight, and any, either Natural or Accidental Importance as to
Labour.</P>
<P>The&s;e as Infirmities meerly Providential are not at all con|cern'd
in this Debate; ever were, will, and ought to be the Charge
and Care of the Re&s;pective Pari&s;hes where &s;uch unhappy People
chance to live, nor is there any want of new Laws to make Pro|vi&s;ion
for them, our Ance&s;tors having been always careful to
do it.</P>
<P>The Crimes of our People, and from whence their Poverty
derives, as the vi&s;ible and direct Fountains are,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Luxury.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Sloath.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Pride.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Good Husbandry is no <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Vertue, it may have been
brought over, and in &s;ome Places where it has been planted it has
thriven well enough, but 'tis a Forreign Species, it neither loves,
nor is belov'd by an <HI>Engli&s;h-man;</HI> and 'tis ob&s;erv'd, nothing is
&s;o 'univer&s;ally hated, nothing treated with &s;uch a general Con|tempt
as a Rich Covetous Man, tho' he does no Man any Wrong,
only &s;aves his own, every Man will have an ill word for him, if a
Misfortune happens to him, hang him a coverous old Rogue,
'tis no Matter, he's Rich enough, nay when a certain great
Man's Hou&s;e was on Fire, I have heard the People &s;ay one to a|nother,
let it burn and 'twill, he's a covetous old mi&s;erly Dog, I
wo'nt trouble my head to help him, he'd be hang'd before he'd
give us a bit of Bread if we wanted it.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="25">
Tho this be a Fault, yet I ob&s;erve from it &s;omething of the
natural Temper and Genius of the Nation, generally &s;peaking,
they cannot &s;ave their Money.</P>
<P>'Tis generally &s;aid the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> get E&s;tates, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;ave
them; and this ob&s;ervation I have made between Forreigners
and <HI>Engli&s;h-men,</HI> that where an <HI>Engli&s;h-man</HI> earns 20 <HI>s. per</HI> Week,
and <HI>but ju&s;t lives,</HI> as we call it, a <HI>Dutch-man</HI> grows Rich, and
leaves his Children in very good Condition; where an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> la|bouring
Man with his <HI>9s. per</HI> Week lives wretchedly and poor,
a <HI>Dutch-man</HI> with Wages will live very to$erably well, keep
the Wolf from the Door, and have every thing hand&s;ome about
him. In &s;hort, he will be Rich with the &s;ame Gain as makes
the <HI>Engli&s;h-man</HI> poor, he'll thrive when the other goes in Rags,
and he'll live when the other &s;tarves, or goes a begging.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on is plain, a Man with good Husbandry, and
Thought in his Head, brings home his Earnings hone&s;tly to his
Family, commits it to the Management of his Wife, or otherwi&s;e
di&s;po&s;es it for proper Sub&s;i&s;tance, and this Man with mean Gains
lives comfotably, and brings up a Family, when a &s;ingle Man
getting the &s;ame Wages, Drinks it away at the Ale-hou&s;e, thinks
$ot of to morrow, layes up nothing for Sicken&s;s, Age, or Di&s;after,
and when any of the&s;e happen he's &s;tarv'd, and a Beggar.</P>
<P>This is &s;o apparent in every place, that I think it needs no Ex|plication;
that <HI>Engl&s;h</HI> Labouring Peoplo eat and drink, but e&s;peci|ally
the latter three times as much in velue as any &s;ort of Forreig|ners
of the &s;ame Dimen&s;ions in the World.</P>
<P>I am not Writing this as a Satyr on our People, 'tis a &s;ad Truth;
and Worthy the, Debate and Application of the Nations Phy$ians
A&s;&s;embled in Parliament, the pro&s;u&s;e Extravagant Humour of our
poor People in eating and drinking, keeps them low, cau&s;es their
Children to be left naked and &s;tarving, to the care of the Pari&s;hes,
whenever either Sickne&s;s or Di&s;a&s;ter befalls the Parent.</P>
<P>The next Article is their <HI>Sloath.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="27" REF="26">
But there is a general Taint of Slothfulne&s;s upon our Poor, there's
nothing more frequent, than for an <HI>Engli&s;h-man</HI> to Work till he
has got his Pocket full of Money, and then go and be idle, <HI>or
perhaps drunk,</HI> till 'tis all gone, and perhaps him&s;elf in Debt; and
ask him in his Cups what he intends, he'll tell you hone&s;tly, he'll
drink as long as it la&s;ts, and then go to work for more.</P>
<P>I humbly &s;ugge&s;t this Di&s;temper's &s;o General, &s;o Epidemick,
and &s;o deep Rooted in the Natured and Genius of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that
I much doubt it's being ea&s;ily redre&s;s'd, and que&s;tion whether it
be po&s;&s;ible to reach it by an Act of Parliament.</P>
<P>This is the Ruine of our Poor, the <HI>Wife mourns,</HI> the Children
<HI>starves,</HI> the Husband <HI>has Work before him,</HI> but lies at the Ale|hou&s;e,
or otherwi&s;e <HI>idles away</HI> his time, and won't Work.</P>
<P>'Tis the Men that <HI>wont work,</HI> not the Men that <HI>can get no work,</HI>
which makes the numbers of our Poor; all the Work-hou&s;es in
<HI>England,</HI> all the Over&s;eers &s;etting up Stocks and Manufactures
won't reach this Ca&s;e; and I humbly pre&s;ume to &s;ay, if the&s;e two
Articles are remov'd, there will be no need of the other.</P>
<P>I make no Difficulty to promi&s;e on a &s;hort Summons, to pro|duce
above a Thou&s;and Families in <HI>England,</HI> within my particu|lar
knowledge, who go in Rags, and their Children wanting
Bread, who&s;e Fathers can earn their 15 to <HI>25s.</HI> per Week, but
will not work, who may have Work enough, but are too idle to
&s;eek after it, and hardly vouch&s;a&s;e to earn any thing more than
bare Sub&s;i&s;tance, and Spending Money for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I can give an incredible number of Examples in my own
Knowledge among our Labouring Poor. I once paid 6 or 7 Men
together on a <HI>Saturday</HI> Night, the lea&s;t <HI>10s.</HI> and &s;ome <HI>30s.</HI> for
Work, and have &s;een them go with it directly to the Ale-hou&s;e,
lie there till <HI>Monday,</HI> &s;pend it every Penny, and run in Debt to
boot, and not give a Farthing of it to their Families, tho' all of
them had Wives and Children.</P>
<P>From hence comes Poverty, Pari&s;h Charges, and Beggary, if e|ver
one of the&s;e Wretches falls &s;ick, all they would ask was a
Pa&s;sto the Pari&s;h they liv'd at, and the Wife and Children to the
Door a Begging.</P>
<P>If this Honourable Hou&s;e can find out a Remedy for this part of
the Mi&s;chief; if &s;uch Acts of Parliament may be made as may ef|fectually
cure the Sloth and Luxury of our Poor, that &s;hall make

Drunkards take care of Wife and Children, &s;pendthrifts, lay up
for a <HI>met Day;</HI> Idle, Lazy Fellows Diligent; and Thoughtle&s;s
So$i&s;h Men, Careful and Provident.</P>
<P>If this can be done, I pre&s;ume to &s;ay there will be no need of
tran&s;f$po$mag and confounding our Manufactures, and the Circulati|on
of our Trade; they will &s;oon find work enough, and there will
&s;oon be le&s;s Poverty among us, and if this cannot be done, &s;eeting
them to work upon Woolen Manufactures, and thereby encroach|ing
upon tho&s;e that now work at them, will but ruine our Trade,
and con&s;equently increa&s;e the number of the Poor.</P>
<P>I do not pre&s;ume to offer the Schemes I have now drawn of
Methods for the bringing much of this to pa&s;s, becau&s;e I &s;hall not

Attempt now making m&s;ufficient; and doubt not but in your

Matter in a clearet Light, and on a right Foot.</P>
<P>And if this obtains on the Hou&s;e to examine farther into this
