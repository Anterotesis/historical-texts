<HEAD>A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE Pacifick Campaign IN <HI>FLANDERS,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_I Shall u&s;e very little Apolo|gy in beginning this brief Hi&s;tory; my de&s;ign is to make it u&s;eful to the Pub|blick: As the Secret and Unaccountable <HI>Steps</HI> of it, are the fir&s;t Motives of leading the Parliament into
<PB N="2" REF="3">
an Enquiry after all our <HI>Misfortunes</HI> by &s;triking at the very <HI>Root</HI> of them, <HI>The fatal Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms.</HI> Hence &s;prung up the general Calamity of <HI>Europe;</HI> and that more particular and dangerous One to <HI>Great-Britain:</HI> And that every hone&s;t <HI>Briton</HI> may be ne|ce&s;&s;arily apprized of the&s;e Things, when the Examination of them in Parliament &s;hall be a chief and gene|ral &s;ubject of Di&s;cour&s;e, I will here &s;et them in the mo&s;t clear and impartial Light po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I will not mention our great Succe&s;|&s;es of former Campaigns, nor the pitch of Glory we then &s;tood in, becau&s;e I think it would rai&s;e in the Reader a too Melancholly Idea at beginning; but will pa&s;s briefly to the Evolutions of that fatal and inglorious Campaign.</P>
<P>Give me leave however to remem|ber that the Commons had Voted all the nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Supplies</HI> for a vigorous and offen&s;ive Campaign; and that the Queen had a&s;&s;ured the Parliament, <HI>She de&s;igned to carry on the War with Vigour, in Conjunction with her Allies;</HI> as well as what &s;he had Wrote to the
<PB N="3" REF="4">
States General before; and all con|firmed by the <HI>Declaration</HI> of Her Am|ba&s;&s;ador the Earl of <HI>Stra&s;&s;ord,</HI> to their High Mightine&s;&s;es at the <HI>Hague,</HI> who on the 18th of <HI>April,</HI> preceding this Campaign, told them, <HI>That Her Maje|&s;ty de&s;igned their Troops &s;hould act with the &s;ame vigour again&s;t</HI> France, <HI>as if no Negotiation had been on Foot.</HI> I might add the &s;ame promi&s;e made to Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> here in <HI>England</HI> at that time, both by the Queen, the General, and the Mini&s;ters; but I need not u&s;e other Arguments or Quotations to prove what will of it &s;elf appear, the high|e&s;t breach of Faith and In&s;incerity, that was ever charged upon Chri&s;tian People, and which none but Men abandon'd to the di&s;truction of their Country could have given into, tho' even the be&s;t Rea&s;ons they are capable of giving for it, were to be depended on.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, At the very time that we were making all the&s;e warm <HI>Promi|&s;es,</HI> and deceitfully &s;haking Hands with our Allies, we were with the other Hand dealing a favourable Game to the common Enemy: This was by u&s;ing
<PB N="4" REF="5">
all the Secret Endeavours in our Power to prevent the States of <HI>Brabant</HI> from &s;upplying that great Body of Imperial Troops then Marching to the <HI>Nether|lands;</HI> thereby to hinder, or at lea&s;t, retard their coming into the Country, without whom the <HI>French</HI> knew the Allies wou'd be able to make but a &s;lender Figure that Campaign; and wou'd the more naturally fall into the di&s;tructive Arcana's of Peace. The particular hand we had in this, the Tran&s;actions of tho&s;e Times will plain|ly &s;hew; and I &s;hall now pa&s;s over, and come to the Campaign.</P>
<P>The Confederates Troops, accord|ing to their Orders, begun about the middle of <HI>April</HI> to March into the Field; and the Prince of <HI>Savoy,</HI> not long be|fore arriv'd from <HI>England,</HI> &s;et out to Command them, and wait the arrival of the Duke of <HI>Ormond;</HI> who being accompanied by Sir <HI>Thomas Hanmer,</HI> a Man of Figure in his Country, and in Parliament, was looked upon as an ill pre&s;age; becau&s;e it was not only un|u&s;ual for an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> General to bring with him a <HI>Deputy,</HI> or <HI>Comptroller,</HI> but that People, being before inclinable to
<PB N="5" REF="6">
too many Fears, were apt to catch at every little incident that &s;eemed to make again&s;t them, and perhaps more &s;ometimes than was real; but I think they were hardly deceived as to their Doubts and Fears from <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>But let me now &s;ay, that from the beginning of the War, we never &s;tood on a greater Emminence of Power, nor had &s;o fair a Pro&s;pect of Succe&s;s. The Imperial Troops had broke through all Difficulties, and were ar|rived in the Army, and the fir&s;t &s;cene of a Glorious Campaign had been opened very early, by burning and de|&s;troying the general Magazines of the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Arras,</HI> and &s;triking &s;ufficient Terror to the Enemy.</P>
<P>The two chief Generals, the Prince of <HI>Savoy</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> ha|ving held the nece&s;&s;ary Conferences concerning the Campaign, and all the mutual Favours and Civilities pa&s;&s;ed on both &s;ides, they &s;et out together for the Army, then encamp'd between <HI>Doway</HI> and <HI>Marchiennes,</HI> and four Days after broke up, as if to enter on offen|&s;ive Mea&s;ures; the Army, to the num|ber
<PB N="6" REF="7">
122250 Men, divided into two Com|mands. The Prince encamped with his Right at <HI>Noyelles,</HI> and his left at <HI>Montrecourt,</HI> and the Duke with his Right at &s;ome di&s;tance from the Prince's Left; and his Left at <HI>Bria&s;e</HI> on the River <HI>Selle.</HI> The Troops under General <HI>Fagel</HI> at the &s;ame time join'd the Grand Army; thirteen Battalions, and thirty Squadrons were left for the Security of our Bridges, and to &s;ecure a Communication with <HI>Marchiennes</HI> where our chief Magazines lay.</P>
<P>By all which Di&s;po&s;itions it &s;eem'd plain that the De&s;ign was to attack the Enemy, who, with an inferior Army, ventur'd to encamp as if they had in|vited us to attempt a Battle; but alas! they knew their Security lay in quite other Means, and too well under&s;tood our in&s;incerity.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and the States Deputies &s;oon perceiv'd an Advantage if all was right; but were doubtful of &s;ome underhand Dealing, more e&s;pe|cially when they &s;aw the <HI>French</HI> &s;o hardily inclined to &s;tand them. But to lo&s;e no time, and to &s;ound the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="8">
General, they propo&s;ed fir&s;t &s;ending out a Detachment to view the &s;ituation of the Enemy, to which the Duke very readily con&s;ented. This was the 27th of <HI>May,</HI> and the Imperial General <HI>Felz,</HI> who was &s;ent on this occa&s;ion, brought Word, <HI>That the Spring-head of the</HI> Schelde <HI>and the</HI> Somme, <HI>was large enough for Twenty Squadrons to March a brea&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>This fired the Prince of <HI>Savoy,</HI> as it did all the other Generals to whom it was related: His Highne&s;s inwardly re&s;olved to fight them without lo&s;s of time; the <HI>Dutch</HI> concurr'd, and Di&s;po|&s;itions were made to that purpo&s;e: But now came the Tryal, for the Prince came to the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> the next Morning, and told him in a very plea&s;ing manner, <HI>That &s;uch an Opportunity now pre&s;ented to Fight the Ene|my, as he knew his Grace could not but ap|prove, &s;ince it promis'd &s;o fair an I&s;&s;ue of Succe&s;s and &s;o much Honour to him.</HI> But the Duke, like a Man unre&s;olved, did not an&s;wer it with any readine&s;s of Ex|pre&s;&s;ion, always con&s;picuous in Men of Glory; but with &s;omething of Con|cern, told the Prince, <HI>He could not im|mediately
<PB N="8" REF="9">
re&s;olve on this, till he had had the Opininon of his Officers, but would do it in the Afternoon;</HI> and for this pur|po&s;e invited the Prince, Count <HI>Tilly,</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Field Deputies to Dine with him.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Duke, to make a &s;hew of doing &s;omething, de|tach'd all the Grenadiers of his Army, under the Command of a Tru&s;ty Ge|neral, with a De&s;ign, as it was given out, to drive the Enemy from &s;ome advanced Po&s;ts, but they returned, as 'tis remarkable, without the lea&s;t Act of Ho&s;tility, not being able, as they pretended, to come at the Enemy for &s;ome Defiles; and added, That the <HI>French</HI> had rai&s;ed &s;ome Works to hin|der the Confederates from pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Schelde;</HI> when indeed the mo&s;t probable Cau&s;e was, That they had thereby an opportunity of gaining &s;ome Advice from Mar&s;hal <HI>Villars.</HI></P>
<P>This Report, which was then thought to be nothing but meer Con|trivance, however, furni&s;hed the Duke of <HI>O&mdash;d</HI> with a plau&s;ible Ex|cu&s;e to object again&s;t the Prince's Mea|&s;ures,
<PB N="9" REF="10">
who was perfectly out of Pati|ence, as perceiving the &s;light, urged the Matter &s;o far, as well as the States Deputies, that they left this poor Great Man no &s;helter, or farther Eva|&s;ion, but forced him openly to declare, <HI>That he had receiv'd po&s;itive Orders from the Queen not to agree to a Battle;</HI> where|upon the Prince, without any great &s;urprize, made An&s;wer, <HI>That indeed, after what had been &s;aid to him, he could not have expected &s;uch an An&s;wer; but however, if his Grace was under &s;uch Orders, they did not wholly di&s;appoint the Succe&s;s of the Campaign, for they might &s;till, in Obedience to tho&s;e Orders, under|take the Sieges of</HI> Landrecy <HI>and</HI> Que&s;noy, <HI>and after penetrate to</HI> Paris <HI>through the Country of</HI> Champaign. But alas the Duke had an An&s;wer ready for this too, viz. <HI>That his Orders &s;orbad him to enter into any Action again&s;t the Enemy, either by Battle or by Siege.</HI></P>
<P>At which the Prince is &s;aid to have an&s;wer'd, and very probably, <HI>My Lord, What d' ye here then?</HI> But waving all farther Reflection, his Highne&s;s and the Deputies expo&s;tulated further with the Duke, adding that the Confederate
<PB N="10" REF="11">
Army having now pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Schelde</HI> and <HI>Selle,</HI> and being advanced into the middle of the Enemies Garri&s;ons, they could not retreat without the hazard of receiving a Blow, and that it would have been better &s;ince it was &s;o, that he had di&s;covered his Orders before they had drawn them&s;elves into that hazard.</P>
<P>With what Contempt this An&s;wer of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> General mu&s;t be receiv'd let any one imagine; however, it was kept as &s;ecret as po&s;&s;ible, both to pre|vent &s;uch Di&s;orders as might have hap|pen'd in the Army, as to take &s;uch o|ther Mea&s;ures and Precautions as might be nece&s;&s;ary to prevent the fatal Con&s;equences. In order to which, the States Deputies immediately di|&s;patch'd an Expre&s;s to the <HI>Hague,</HI> of what had happen'd; and 'tis ea&s;y to &s;uppo&s;e what a Con&s;ternation it rai&s;ed there: They fir&s;t &s;ent a Complaint of this to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> at <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> who an&s;wer'd, <HI>That he knew nothing of the Matter, and would repre&s;ent it to the Queen;</HI> but took an occa&s;ion at the &s;ame time, to upbraid them with their Conduct in not complying with the
<PB N="11" REF="12">
Peace, and in the end, to let them know, <HI>That her Maje&s;ty thought her&s;elf di&s;engaged from all Alliances and Engage|ments with the States.</HI></P>
<P>There needed no Wings to &s;peed this Me&s;&s;age to the <HI>Hague;</HI> all <HI>Holland,</HI> and even the whole Confederacy was under the greate&s;t Alarm; they began to &s;u&s;pect, that either the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had made a &s;eparate Peace, or at lea&s;t intend|ed to do it; nor was they wholly free from &s;ear, that they &s;hould join the Ar|my of the Enemy. At the <HI>Hague,</HI> the Mini&s;ters of all the Allies, were call'd together, and &s;everal Conferences were held, and private Mea&s;ures concerted, e&s;pecially, between the States, the Elector of <HI>Hanover</HI> our pre&s;ent Sove|reign, the <HI>Landgrave</HI> of <HI>He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el,</HI> and &s;ome other <HI>German</HI> Princes, for &s;ub&s;i&s;ting the Foreign Troops in <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Pay; &s;o that the Army might &s;uffer no other Diminution than by the Na|tive Troops of <HI>Britain,</HI> amounting to about Twelve Thou&s;and Men.</P>
<P>The States General, in the mean time, wrote a long and moving Letter to the Queen, which does very ju&s;tly
<PB N="12" REF="13">
expo&s;e the wavering and faithle&s;s Con|duct of a ba&s;e and treacherous Mini&s;try; to which the Queen an&s;wer'd:</P>

<P><Q>&startq;THere is nothing dearer to us than the Pre&s;ervation of a good Under&s;tanding and a Perfect U|nion with your State.

<Q>&startq;We &s;uppo&s;e the Alarms which you took on Account of the Declarations made by the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> and the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> are now over; and we repeat to you what we have &s;o often declared, That it will be your own Fault, as it has been in the time pa&s;t, if all our Mea&s;ures about War or Peace be not taken in Concert&endq; with your State.</Q></P>

<P>I am unwilling to reflect on this An|&s;wer of the Queen's, becau&s;e there is &s;uch a clutter made about her Memory; but I cannot help &s;aying there is &s;omewhat in it very poor and artificial. After be|traying a Confederacy, and lo&s;ing the mo&s;t Glorious Opportunity that ever offer'd, we come to &s;ay, <HI>We &s;uppo&s;e the</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="15">
<HI>Alarms which you took on account of the Declarations of the Duke of</HI> Ormond, <HI>and the Bi&s;hop of</HI> Bri&s;tol, <HI>are now over;</HI> What wretched Foible and Prevarica|tion is this? And what mean Spirits mu&s;t they be, what &s;huffling vile Poli|ticians, that could Dictate to a victo|rious Monarch any thing &s;o poor, &s;o cajoling, and in&s;incere? But to return to the Army.</P>
<P>The <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> General having made the afore&s;aid Declaration, That he could not Engage in any Action, ei|ther by Battle or Siege, again&s;t the Enemy, the Confederate Army was obliged to lye inactive and wa&s;te many Days in the prime of the Summer, in tedious Expectations of a final An&s;wer from the Court of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and giving the Enemy an opportunity to improve their Army, provide their Towns, and to &s;ecure them&s;elves a|gain&s;t the wor&s;t: But there was no re|medy but a little Patience. Had we been &s;o ingenuous with them at fir&s;t, to have re&s;olved them, that we did not intend to make the Campaign again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> it would have been an Advan|tage to the Allies to have known it,
<PB N="15" REF="16">
and they might have taken the Field with an Army &s;ufficient to have made an offen&s;ive Campaign without the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Troops; but the making the Enemy Ma&s;ter of the Secret, and not the Allies, was of the highe&s;t Service to <HI>France;</HI> and the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Forces only a Check or Comptroll upon the Con|federates; a Burden and Inconvenien|cy that ruined the Campaign, the Alli|ance, and the Peace, and &s;et the Enemy in a condition to Brave us, and from whom ever after, even Tho&s;e who had been the Means of their attaining this Power, were not able to obtain the lea&s;t Point toward accompli&s;hing that Peace, which they had pretendedly &s;et up for Dictators of. Now was the time that <HI>France</HI> held a winning Game; they had the Confederates at Mercy, and nothing to fear from the Pu&s;ilani|mous <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> the Necks of who&s;e Mi|ni&s;try their King had under his Girdle. He knew that they were out of all manner of Credit of re&s;toring them|&s;elves with the Allies, without carry|ing on the War, and breaking off the Negotiations, and that this could not be done with any &s;ecurity to them|&s;elves, for it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be attend|ed
<PB N="16" REF="17">
with a Change of the Mini&s;try, the&s;e having publickly, as well as pri|vately, gone &s;uch lengths in the Peace, that there was no turning back; and to &s;ecure them&s;elves, wou'd not &s;tick to grant any Conce&s;&s;ions that could be demanded of them. To which mi&s;er|able Rea&s;ons we owe all our Misfor|tunes; for it was certainly as much the Intere&s;t of the&s;e Wretches to make a good Peace as a bad one, had they gone hone&s;tly and fairly about it. For the &s;ame Rea&s;ons, had they been pu&s;hed a little farther by the Whigs, who led them but an unea&s;y kind of Life, they would at length have gone roundly to work to have brought in the Pretender, under whom they might plau&s;ibly have dated their Security; many of them having regretted &s;ince that they drove it off &s;o long.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Army lay gaping for News from <HI>England,</HI> and exclaiming with open Mouths again&s;t the Proceed|ings of the <HI>British</HI> General; the News of what had been done in <HI>Flanders</HI> &s;truck a general &s;urprize through the whole Nation; the Guilt of which the Mini&s;ters were &s;o Con&s;cious of, that it
<PB N="17" REF="18">
was made a Crime, that one of the News Papers, <HI>The Flying Po&s;t,</HI> had ventur'd to a&s;&s;ert it in Print, as if they were a&s;hamed to own, what they had not been a&s;hamed to act.</P>
<P>However, it could not e&s;cape the cognizance of Parliament, The Hou&s;e of Lords had a particular meeting upon it; and the Mini&s;try had no other way to allay the heat it was like to rai&s;e, but by a cajoling Promi&s;e, which we &s;hall &s;ee they were as little inclined to keep as any of the Engage|ments they had made before. The Lord Trea&mdash;er therefore, to &s;top the Mouths of the Hou&s;e, told them, <HI>That Orders had been &s;ent away to the Duke of</HI> Ormond <HI>to join with the Allies in a Siege; and that in a few days Her Maje&s;ty, according to Her Promi&s;e will lay before them, the Conditions on which a General Peace might be had; which he doubted not would give entire &s;atisfaction to every Member of that A&s;&s;embly, and to all true Engli&s;hmen.</HI> By which di&s;|&s;imulated Declaration the Mini&s;ters pre|vailed to have the Debate adjourned: But the hone&s;t Party in the Hou&s;e &s;ent &s;uch a Sting after it in the following
<PB N="18" REF="19">
Prote&s;t, as made them very re&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;ie; and 'tis certain no Men were ever under a greater perplexity than the Mini&s;try were at this time, which as I have ob&s;erv'd, they were driven on by the indefatigable Conduct of the Whigs, whom they were unable to deal withal, even when they were in the highe&s;t Power.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The Prote&s;t of the Lords of the 27th of</HI> May, 1712.</HEAD>
<P><Q>&startq;WE conceive &s;uch an Order as is propos'd in the Que&s;tion, to be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e we are fully convinc'd, that the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> do's lye under &s;ome Order of Re&s;traint, from acting Offen&s;ive|ly, not only from the Accounts which are publick both here and in <HI>Holland,</HI> of his declaring it to Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> and to the Deputies of the States at their late Con&s;ultation, when both Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> and tho&s;e Deputies, earne&s;tly pre&s;s'd him to joyn in attacking the <HI>French</HI> Army, <HI>which was then known to be much Inferior to that of the Allies, both in the Number and Condition of the Troops;</HI> but al&s;o,

for that nothing of this whole Mat|ter was deny'd by tho&s;e Lords who have the Means of knowing the&s;e Facts, as undoubtedly wou'd have been without Scruple, had not the &s;aid Facts been true; &s;ince no Scruple was made of Acquainting the Hou&s;e with a &s;ub&s;equent Order very lately &s;ent to the Duke of <HI>Ormond, allowing him to join in a Siege,</HI> which is a fur|ther Evidence that he had before &s;ome Order of Re&s;traint, for other|wi&s;e this la&s;t Order would be unne|ce&s;&s;ary and ab&s;urd; it being a gene|ral, con&s;tant, and &s;tanding In&s;tructi|on to every Commander in Chief, by Land or Sea, to do his utmo&s;t Endea|vour to annoy the Enemy. And it is manife&s;t by this la&s;t Order, that even in the Opinion of the Mini&s;ters, it was expedient to take off this Re&s;traint to &s;ome degree; and the leaving the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> &s;till under a Re|&s;traint from giving Battle to the <HI>French,</HI> &s;eems mo&s;t unaccountable, and incon&s;i&s;tent with the Liberty in|dulg'd to him of joyning in a Siege, and renders it altogether u&s;ele&s;s: For no Place, when taken, will be of &s;uch Advantage to the Allies, as <HI>Cam|bray,</HI>

<P N="4">4. <Q>&startq;Her Maje&s;ty having with great Wi&s;dom declared to this Parliament, <HI>That the be&s;t means of obtaining a Good</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="23">
<HI>Peace, is to make early Preparations for War, and a vigorous Pro&s;ecution of it;</HI> and &s;ince the Parliament has with great Duty and Deference to Her Maje&s;ty, and a Zeal for the Inte|re&s;t of their Country, and of <HI>Eu|rope, given very great Supplies for that Purpo&s;e,</HI> We conceive that &s;uch an Order of Re&s;traint being very different from that Declaration of Her Maje&s;ty, <HI>mu&s;t be the Effect of very ill Advice;</HI> by which the Parliament's good Intentions will be defeated, and all tho&s;e heavy Loads of Taxes, which they have for &s;o good Purpo&s;es chear|fully given, render'd fruitle&s;s and un|nece&s;&s;ary, and may, in Conclu&s;ion, after having thus trifled away our Wealth and Time, bring Us into the Nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>accepting &s;uch a Peace, as &s;hall plea&s;e an in&s;olent and domineering&endq; Enemy to give Us.</HI></Q></P>
<P>If the Lords &s;aw rea&s;on to u&s;e this la&s;t Expre&s;&s;ion, what &s;hall be &s;aid when we come to the end of this fatal Campaign: But I &s;hall now follow the&s;e new repeated Orders to <HI>Flanders,</HI> by which the Lords were with &s;uch Confidence made to believe, the Duke
<PB N="23" REF="24">
of <HI>Ormond</HI> had full Power to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Allies in a Siege; which, if &s;incere, was a very conclu&s;ive and clande&s;tine way of Dealing with Confederates; But even this we &s;hall &s;ee was not du|ly performed.</P>
<P>That &s;uch Orders were &s;ent, there is no doubt; but the Prevarication and Re&s;traint they carried with them, is ju&s;tly becoming &s;o tricking and &s;huffling a Mini&s;try. Upon the re|peated In&s;tances of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Mini&s;ter here, as well as of the Baron <HI>de Hohen|dorf,</HI> Adjutant General to Prince <HI>Eu|gene,</HI> &s;ent over on purpo&s;e to repre&s;ent that Matter here; they at length, as a very great Boon, obtained Satisfaction of the Trea&s;urer to know that Orders had been &s;ent to the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> to concur with the Allies in a Siege; and this too had another Rea&s;on, for the Lords being to meet the &s;ame Day, &s;uch a Declaration might be readily affirm'd to appea&s;e the Storm that was like to gather in the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Accordingly we &s;hall find the&s;e Or|ders di&s;patch'd away the 27th of <HI>May</HI> 1712. and that they arrived in the Ar|my
<PB N="24" REF="25">
the 3d or 4th of <HI>June.</HI> This be|ing known to the Prince of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and the nece&s;&s;ary Conferrences held, it was re&s;olved that the Siege of <HI>Qne&s;noy,</HI> &s;hould be formed, and that the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> General &s;hould cover the Siege.</P>
<P>But let me here fir&s;t take notice, that the Prince of <HI>Savoy</HI> and the States General wi&s;ely conjecturing, that by the former Declaration of the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> and the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters had privately agreed upon a Su&s;pen&s;ion of Arms with <HI>France,</HI> but had rea&s;on to conceal it as long as they could, and would impo&s;e it on the Allies, if they could draw away from them the Auxilliaries in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pay; they had taken &s;uch Mea&s;ures as had &s;ecured tho&s;e Troops in the Inte|re&s;t of the Common Cau&s;e; an incident &s;o well known, that I need not &s;ay more of it.</P>
<P>To proceed: <HI>Que&s;noy</HI> was inve&s;ted the 19th of <HI>June,</HI> and vigorous Prepa|rations made for carrying on the Siege: But &s;carce were the Trenches begun to be open'd, but the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> General re|lap&s;ed again. The <HI>French</HI> having no|tice
<PB N="25" REF="26">
of the Orders &s;ent to the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t in a Siege, could not away with it; it was, tho' a &s;mall Place, a Po&s;t of Con&s;equence, and laid the Heart of their Country open. Our new Friends therefore mu&s;t be grati|fied; and for fear it &s;hould come too late, Orders it &s;eems were not long arriving, for on the 21&s;t of <HI>June,</HI> bare|ly two Days after the Inve&s;titure of the Place, the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> General being invi|ted to a Conference between the Prince of <HI>Savoy,</HI> Count <HI>Tilly,</HI> and the States Deputies, excu&s;ed him&s;elf by rea&s;on of a &s;mall Indi&s;po&s;ition; but indeed, that he might avoid concerting any farther Mea&s;ures with them.</P>
<P>This added much to their former Su|&s;pitions, however, they re&s;olved to pu&s;h on the Siege, and order'd Matters &s;o, that if the Duke &s;hould draw off, the Siege might not want to be duly co|ver'd, which, in the mean time, they pu&s;hed on zealou&s;ly, and render'd it high time, for the Duke to make his private Orders known; for tho&s;e which ju&s;t before they had fooled the Nation with, and made the Pretence to &s;top the Mouths of the Lords, were
<PB N="26" REF="27">
already countermanded, or wholly for|got.</P>
<P>The Duke therefore to put him&s;elf and the Confederates out of Pain, on the 24th of <HI>June,</HI> having acted full five days again&s;t the common Enemy, with that Zeal and Conduct becoming a Paci|fick General, &s;ent to de&s;ire a Conference with the Prince of <HI>Savoy,</HI> the States Field Deputies, wherein, good Man he declared, that he had receiv'd Or|ders from the Queen his Mi&s;tre&s;s, to publi&s;h within three days a Su&s;pen&s;ion of Arms for two Months, between his Army and the <HI>French,</HI> and to make a Detachment to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Dunkirk.</HI></P>
<P>Here we may &s;ee we were arrived to &s;uch a pitch of In&s;incerity and Trick|ing, that to keep our Faith a Month together was impracticable, nay, even a Week, for 'twas no more, between our undertaking to cover the Siege, and our telling the Allies that we were fair|ly going to abandon them, at a time &s;o &s;hort, that 'tis evident &s;uch Contradicti|on of Orders had a nearer Source than what came from <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and
<PB N="27" REF="28">
that very often the breath of a <HI>French</HI> Trumpeter turn'd the Scale of all our Re&s;olutions, and cool'd all our Va|lour into nothing.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t extraordinary piece of Conduct and Policy was, that the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> General propo&s;ed the like Su&s;pen&s;i|on of Arms &s;hould be publi&s;h'd through|out the whole Confederate Army; for which the Prince of <HI>Savoy</HI> and the De|puties had an An&s;wer ready: <HI>That they de&s;ired time to write to their re&s;pective So|vereigns,</HI> in which they would to be &s;ure, have included time enough to have taken the Town; but the Duke replied, that what they demanded was not in his Power to grant; and if they per&s;i&s;ted to carry on the Siege, he could cover the &s;ame no longer, but would March off with his Troops in three Days.</P>
<P>But the principal Card was yet to Play, which was the carrying off the Foreign Troops in <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Pay; who, being acquainted by the Duke, that they mu&s;t obey his Orders, otherwi&s;e they were not to expect to have Bread, Pay, or their Arrears; their Generals,
<PB N="28" REF="29">
Hone&s;tly and Couragiou&s;ly an&s;wer'd, that by Orders from their <HI>Principals,</HI> they were commanded to act again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> and that they could not dero|gate from tho&s;e Orders without fir&s;t ac|quainting their Ma&s;ters; declaring at the &s;ame time, that till they receiv'd any new Commands, they were ob|liged and re&s;olved to continue with the Prince of <HI>Savoy.</HI></P>
<P>This An&s;wer was a very great rub in the Mea&s;ures concerted with <HI>France;</HI> and the March of Ten <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Batta|lions to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> was &s;topt by a Trumpeter from Mar&s;hal <HI>Villars:</HI> The Rea&s;on alledged was, to give time to the re&s;t of the Allies to a|gree to the Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms; but really on other Conditions. It was indeed agreed, that we &s;hould be put into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> on the Pro|vi&s;o of withdrawing our Troops from the Confederates, by which the <HI>French</HI> knew they would be unable to carry on the Siege, which the Mar&s;hal <HI>Villars</HI> would have been in a Condition to have razed, and had already laid Bridges over the <HI>San&s;et</HI> to that End, in ca&s;e (and which the <HI>French</HI> pretended to
<PB N="29" REF="30">
under&s;tand by withdrawing our Troops) that the Auxilliaries had &s;eparated with us: But this not being fulfilled, the Scheme concerted between <HI>Great Bri|tain</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> or the Generals of the two Nations, was overthrown.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Siege of <HI>Que&s;|noy</HI> was carried on with extraordinary Vigour and Succe&s;s: And the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> General irre&s;olute what to do, his Mea|&s;ures with the Mar&s;hal <HI>de Villars</HI> being di&s;concerted, and not having time to &s;end to <HI>Britain,</HI> and receive an An&s;wer before the Town of <HI>Que&s;noy</HI> was like to be in the Confederates Hands, which he fore&s;aw would &s;well their Hopes and leave them at Liberty to make a hand&s;ome Campaign without him, he e'en re&s;olv'd to try what cajoling wou'd do, a Property he had &s;ometimes &s;een practi&s;ed with Succe&s;s by the Mini|&s;try at Home; and therefore &s;ent the Prince of <HI>Savoy</HI> word, <HI>That he would continue with his Troops in the Army, provided he would give over the Siege of Que&s;noy.</HI> Which Me&s;&s;age the Prince re|ceived with the Di&s;dain it de&s;erv'd; and an&s;wer'd, <HI>That in&s;tead of putting a &s;top to that Siege, he would let his Grace &s;ee</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="31">
<HI>he would &s;oon be Ma&s;ter of it, and would after undertake another Expedition, that &s;hould be of greater Moment;</HI> the former of which he &s;oon after fulfilled.</P>
<P>From this time all Corre&s;pondence cea&s;ed between the Prince and the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> General, and time it was; for the frequent Expre&s;&s;es that went and came between the Duke and the <HI>French</HI> Ar|my, did not promi&s;e any good to the Confederate Cau&s;e; and the Prince ex|pre&s;s'd him&s;elf very willing to be rid of them, whom he look'd on only as a Burthen to the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> &s;ince they had declared they would not act again&s;t <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The Auxilliaries refu&s;ing to March off with the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> gave great unea&s;ine&s;s to the <HI>French,</HI> becau&s;e it render'd the lo&s;s of <HI>Que&s;noy</HI> inevita|ble; and the Sollicitations and Impor|tunities from thence, made the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters &s;harers in their Concern. The Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> then in <HI>England,</HI> was di&s;patched over with &s;mart Orders toward accompli&s;hing their Mea&s;ures; who being come to the <HI>Hague,</HI> had &s;e|veral Conferences with the States on
<PB N="31" REF="32">
the Subject in hand, <HI>viz.</HI> the Su&s;pen|&s;ion of Arms; and tho' he talk'd in a Language &s;omewhat natural to him, and &s;ometimes conde&s;cended to &s;often his Voice, yet neither had any effect on the re&s;olute <HI>Dutch,</HI> who being Ma&s;ters of <HI>Que&s;noy,</HI> and a&s;&s;ured of the Foreign Troops, thought them&s;elves in a Con|dition to tell him in plain Terms, <HI>That they could not agree to a Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms, without the &V;nanimous Con&s;ent of all their Allies.</HI> Which made the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador reply with &s;ome heat, <HI>That he would go to the Army and execute his Orders.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> &s;till continued in his former Camp, expecting the I&s;&s;ue of the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI>'s Negotia|tions at the <HI>Hague,</HI> or his Company in the Army, to help him out of the Labyrinth he &s;eemed to be got into; where he found it high time to &s;epa|rate the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Forces from the <HI>Ger|mans,</HI> between whom there was a great Animo&s;ity, and frequent Duels were fought among the Officers and Soldiers, and many were killed on both &s;ides; for the Name of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man, once held in the highe&s;t e&s;teem
<PB N="32" REF="33">
among Foreigners, began now to be a Name of Reproach. But the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> finding he was not like to &s;ucceed better here than at the <HI>Hague,</HI> attempted nothing, but what private Orders he gave to the the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Gene|ral, or what he tran&s;acted with Mar|&s;hal <HI>Villars,</HI> to who&s;e Camp, our Ac|counts at that time made out that he went <HI>Incognito.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Savoy</HI> having re&s;olved in a general Council to undertake the Siege of <HI>Landrecy,</HI> gave the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> notice, <HI>That he de&s;igned to March the next Day, both for want of Forage, and to pro&s;ecute the Operations of the Campaign; and if his Grace intended to do the like, his Highne&s;s was ready to con|&s;er with him in what Place &s;oever the Duke &s;hould appoint.</HI> The Duke an&s;wer'd in Writing, <HI>That he thought it &s;trange &s;uch a Me&s;&s;age &s;hould be &s;ent to him by an ordi|nary Aid de Camp, and that only Twelve Hours before, the Prince was to March, becau&s;e no Mea&s;ures had been concerted be|tween them, relating either to their Motions, or to any further &V;ndertaking; for which Rea&s;ons his Highne&s;s ought not to expect that he &s;hould accompany him, or be a&s;&s;i&s;ting in</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="34">
<HI>any Opperations wherein he had not been previou&s;ly con&s;ulted.</HI></P>
<P>This was only looked on as a matter of Form, and a &s;pecious Pretence for marching away. Accordingly on the 16th of <HI>July,</HI> a Day which will ever be famous in Hi&s;tory for the Separation of the Confederate Army, and decla|ring <HI>The Fatal Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms.</HI> The Prince of <HI>Savoy</HI> broke up fir&s;t from his Camp at <HI>Ha&s;pre,</HI> and March|ed off with the Troops under his Com|mand, being followed by all the <HI>Danes, Pru&s;&s;ians, Saxons, Hanoverians,</HI> and other Auxilliaries in <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Pay, ex|cept Four Squadrons of <HI>Vandarnath,</HI> and a Battalion of <HI>Berner,</HI> and <HI>Walef</HI>'s Regiment of Dragoons: He Encamp|ed the fame Night at <HI>Atre</HI> near <HI>Lan|drecy,</HI> which Place he immediately In|ve&s;ted.</P>
<P>The <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> General Decamped the &s;ame Morning, and in his March cau&s;ed a <HI>Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms</HI> to be Proclaimed for Two Months, between the Queen's Forces and tho&s;e of <HI>France;</HI> at which the Troops were &s;o far from Rejoycing,
<PB N="34" REF="35">
that they cou'd not forbear &s;hewing the utmo&s;t concern at Parting; and it is agreed, that it was not without Tears among &s;everal of the Officers and Soldiers, who had been longe&s;t to|gether. The &s;ame Evening Mar&s;hal <HI>de Villars</HI> &s;ent an <HI>Aid de Camp</HI> to ac|quaint the Duke that he had that Day likewi&s;e declared a Su&s;pen&s;ion of Arms, with Her <HI>Britanick</HI> Maje&s;ties Troops, pur&s;uant to <HI>the Agreement &s;ettled with his Grace.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Mini&s;try had not compleated the Drudgery they were doing for <HI>France,</HI> and performed all they had Covenanted for; yet as they had acted like good Boys, and &s;hewn a willingne&s;s to go through &s;titch, it was re&s;olved to keep them in Counte|nance, and a &s;hew was made of put|ting them in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and &s;ome Troops were &s;ent from <HI>England</HI> to be put in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but on &s;uch precarious Security, as that if we had failed in the Performances expected, the Bargain was yet to be di&s;puted; for the Sloops, Gallies, and Marines were allowed to &s;tay in the Town, a
<PB N="35" REF="36">
Number more than equal to the Forces we had &s;ent thither.</P>
<P>There were Views by which we might make &s;ufficient amends to <HI>France,</HI> for leaving the Auxilliaries in the Ser|vice of the Confederates, a well as for the Lo&s;s of <HI>Que&s;noy;</HI> their Army being March'd to a good di&s;tance, and the Duke having all the Country open to him, might in his March &s;ecure <HI>Douay,</HI> or <HI>Tournay,</HI> which would make up the Equivalent for the &s;ole Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Dunkirk;</HI> but this the wi&s;e Precautions of the Prince of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Generals, had prevented, by refu&s;ing the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pa&s;&s;age through them; For it is to be ob&s;erved that the Duke could not now &s;pare Ten Battalions to March to <HI>Dunkirk</HI> as they were once de&s;ign'd; tho' unle&s;s, upon &s;uch Occa&s;ion as Securing the&s;e, or &s;ome other Towns, it can't be imagined what u&s;e he could have for 12 or 14000 Men, who had declared a Su&s;pen&s;ion of Arms with the <HI>French,</HI> and was at perfect Tranquility with the whole Country.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="37">
It is ea&s;y to deny that they had &s;uch a De&s;ign as Seizing <HI>Douay</HI> or <HI>Tournay,</HI> becau&s;e the Occa&s;ion cuts of all manner of Proof; but it is certainly plain, that if this miscarried, <HI>Bruges</HI> and <HI>Ghent</HI> were to &s;erve the turn. And that this was concerted with the Mar&s;hal <HI>de Villars</HI> in his Camp, before the <HI>Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms</HI> was proclaimed, is no le&s;s True than &s;urprizingly Treacherous; by which means the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Troops making them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the Na|vigation of the <HI>Lys</HI> and the <HI>Schelde,</HI> would be able to put an effectual &s;top to any farther Progre&s;s of the Confede|rate Army, in ca&s;e the <HI>French</HI> General &s;hould find it impracticable to relieve <HI>Landrecy.</HI> This was called one of the mo&s;t glorious and be&s;t concerted Pro|jects that ever was laid; and I have heard, that to rob the Earl of <HI>Str&mdash;d</HI> of the Honour of having concerted it with Mar&s;hal <HI>Villars,</HI> &s;ome of the Mi|ni&s;try were &s;o fond of it, as to claim the &s;ole Invention of it; and indeed it &s;eems very natural to be a&s;cribed to them, it is &s;o much of a piece with the re&s;t of their tricking and perfiddious Conduct. By this good Office we were
<PB N="37" REF="38">
admitted to the &s;ole Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Dun|kirk,</HI> and &s;ix Battalions were now &s;ent from the Army to be put into the Place; who had before March'd &s;o many Leagues a quite contrary way.</P>
<P>This Tran&s;action gave a little Ea&s;e to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Court, and they look'd upon them&s;elves now as perfectly Ma|&s;ters of the Negotiations of Peace; which was their chief aim. Her Ma|je&s;ty, as they termed it, being fully re&s;olved not to depart from the Scheme &s;he had laid down, whatever was the Con&s;equence, and indeed the Con&s;e|quence was fatal enough; the ruin of the Confederacy, and of the Trade and Welfare of <HI>Britain</HI> having been the I&s;&s;ue of it; and from which no human Re|lief could be expected, but the &s;ea&s;on|able, and almo&s;t unexpected Ble&s;&s;ing of his Maje&s;ty's happy Acce&s;&s;ion to the Throne.</P>
<P>What follow'd of the Campaign our Enemies will tell with Plea&s;ure.&mdash;I &s;hall only ob&s;erve farther, that it af|forded the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters a great deal of Plea&s;ure, to &s;ee <HI>France</HI> triumph o|ver
<PB N="38" REF="39">
the Allies; and that they acted a more domineering part in the Negocia|tion of Peace than ever; in&s;i&s;ted on the admi&s;&s;ion of King <HI>Philip</HI>'s Pleni|potentiary, or threaten'd to remove the Congre&s;s from <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> to &s;ome Town where they might come with|out oppo&s;ition; with &s;everal other marks of their great Authority. But as I am not of the &s;ubject of Peace, I &s;hall mention it no farther.</P>
<P>I am now come to the la&s;t Trea&s;ona|ble &s;tep of <HI>The fatal Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms:</HI> What was before called the <HI>Su&s;pen&s;ion of Arms,</HI> Proclaimed in the Army, ha|ving had an Effect &s;o welcome to the Contrivers, being near expiring, it was judged nece&s;&s;ary to prolong it; for which end <HI>B&mdash;ke,</HI> who had had the greate&s;t Hand in all the Vil|lainous Management, was pitched on to go to the Court of <HI>France</HI> incog|nito, both to prolong the <HI>Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms,</HI> and to &s;ettle &s;ome important Points yet depending to put the fini&s;h|ing Hand to the Ruin of his Country. Accordingly, with his Under Secretary <HI>Hare,</HI> Mr. <HI>Prior,</HI> and the Abbot <HI>Gaul|tier,</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="40">
he &s;et out for <HI>France</HI> the begin|ning of <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI> I need not tell you of the Grand Reception he met with there, it has been too much talked of already; and the Obligations the <HI>French</HI> lay un|der to him, were of much greater va|lue to them, than the <HI>Briliant</HI> which was the Price of his Journey thither; his Services being repaid in a more Li|beral and Private way.</P>
<P>Let me give him the ju&s;t Infamy of Agreeing the <HI>fatal Ce&s;&s;ation;</HI> of his Conferring with the Queen Dowager of <HI>England;</HI> and his Interview with the Pretender; with other Points and Overtacts of Trea&s;on that fall to his &s;ingle &s;hare in the general Ruin and Prejudice acquired to his Country: Which the Parliament has generou&s;ly promi&s;ed to bring him and others to <HI>Condign Puni&s;hment</HI> for, from the Guilt of which he is now fled.</P>
<P>I believe, that whoever Reads the Hi&s;tory of this Campaign, and of the &s;teps to <HI>The Fatal Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms,</HI> the Source and Origin of all our Mis|fortunes, will very little doubt the
<PB N="40" REF="41">
Proof which a certain Great Per&s;on in Parliament has affirmed to be in his Hands, <HI>viz. That the</HI> Briti&s;h General, <HI>for &s;everal Months before the Terms of Peace were known or concluded, had pri|vate Orders to regulate his Conduct accor|ding to the In&s;tructions he &s;hould receive from the General of</HI> France; which is the only Evidence wanting to make good a Charge of High Trea&s;on again&s;t Tho&s;e who either advi&s;ed their Sove|raign (or dur&s;t of them&s;elves) to &s;end Orders of &s;uch a heinous Nature.
