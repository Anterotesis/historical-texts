The Duke and Dutche&s;s
OF
O&mdash;S.
WITH
The Amorous Intrigues and Ad|ventures
of divers of the mo&s;t

of France.</HEAD>
<P>THE Marriage of his Royal
Highne&s;s the Duke of
<HI>O&mdash;s</HI> with the Prince&s;s of
<HI>England,</HI> Si&s;ter to King
<HI>Charles</HI> II. afforded a thou&s;and fre&s;h
Opportunities of Diver&s;ion to the
<PB N="2" REF="6">
<HI>French</HI> Court; nothing was to be
&s;een there, but Entertainments, Hun|ting
Matches, Balls, Opera's and Plays
to divert the Lords and Ladies of
that Court, at &s;o agreeable a Con|juncture;
but the God of Love, the
Great Conqueror of the Univer&s;e,
who makes every thing &s;ubmit to
his Empire, ca&s;ting his Eyes upon &s;o
fair an A&s;&s;embly, immediately laid a
de&s;ign of making the Hearts of the&s;e
Gallant Per&s;ons &s;en&s;ible of the force
of his Darts. The Dutche&s;s of&mdash;
as her ill Stars would have it, who
was not very fond of her Husband,
happened to be among the number of
tho&s;e that were conquered by his
Arms, and &s;oon knew her Conqueror.
This was the Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI> a Man
ambitious to the highe&s;t degree, the
Son of the Ma$&s;hal <HI>de Grammont,</HI> and
<HI>Mai&s;tre de Camp</HI> of the Regiment of
<HI>French</HI> Guards, who being one of the
King's Favourites, wanted not Vanity
to rai&s;e his Amorous Thoughts to
the highe&s;t Pitch, being &s;o far entan|gled
by her Charms, and extraordi|nary
<PB N="3" REF="7">
Merits, that he re&s;olved to pur|cha&s;e
her Favour at the Expence of
all his Fortune. The Count in the
very fir&s;t beginning of his Pa&s;&s;ions
appearing one day at a Fea&s;t, the King
gave to the Ladies at <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> in a
very melancholy Air, the Dutche&s;s,
with a very engaging Look; <HI>Ala$
Count</HI> (&s;aid &s;he) <HI>pray tell me without
di&s;gui&s;e, what grand Projects you are
framing at this time, which takes up all
your Thoughts, and makes you &s;o penfive?</HI>
The Count <HI>de Guiche</HI> quite amazed at
his unexpected good Fortune, was &s;o
far from being able to return an im|mediate
An&s;wer, that he was ready
to drop down at her Feet; however,
having recovered him&s;elf a little, he
made the Dutche&s;s &s;en&s;ible, in a lan|gui&s;hing
Tone, that he was touch'd
to the Heart beyond expre&s;&s;ion. The
Dutche&s;s, who was of a tender Di&s;po|&s;ition,
and knew very well, that the
King's Addre&s;&s;es to her had afforded
no &s;mall Subject of Jealou&s;ie to the
Count, told him with a Smile; <HI>You
are very agreeable in Point of Love,
<PB N="4" REF="8">
there are not many who can compare with
you, your Addre&s;&s;es will not fail to meet
with a grateful return.</HI> The Count was
going to return his humble Thanks to
the Prince&s;s, in the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive
and pa&s;&s;ionate Terms that could be,
when our Great Monarch drawing
near, follow'd her clo&s;e into a Clo&s;et,
where &s;he was &s;eeking for a litle Re|tirement.
Seating him&s;elf by her,
the Count, who was got behind the
Tape&s;try, had the Mortification to be
an Ear-witne&s;s of the Addre&s;&s;es the
King made to her. The Dutche&s;s,
who knew that the Count was in a
Corner behind the Tape&s;try, vex'd at
the King's Pre&s;ence with Eyes &s;park|ling
with Anger, entertain'd his Pa&s;|&s;ion
with Raillery; which made his
Maje&s;ty tell her with a Serious Air, he
could not imagine what could move
her to turn his Sufferings into Ridi|cule.
<HI>Sir,</HI> (reply'd &s;he with a low
Voice, but not without Laughing
more heartily than before) <HI>I have per|haps
&s;ome Rea&s;ons to my &s;elf not to re|ceive
your Addre&s;&s;es without &V;nquiet|ne&s;s.</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="9">
That Prince who hitherto had
thought he had nothing to fear, ari|&s;ing
from his Seat, drew his Sword,
and began to &s;earch every Corner of
the room, while the Prince&s;s trembling
with fear, made a &s;ign to the Count,
to get away as fa&s;t as he could, to a|void
falling into the King's Hands: He
was no &s;ooner gone, but bur&s;ting out
a Laughing, <HI>Sir,</HI> cry'd &s;he, <HI>I believe
you are drawing your Sword again&s;t
Shades and Spectres; What makes your
Maje&s;ty to be in &s;uch a Rage? You &s;ee
we are alone, nothing in the World di|&s;turbs
us. Madam,</HI> (reply'd the King,
with a loud Voice;) <HI>&V;nle&s;s I am
&s;trangely mi&s;taken, I &s;aw &s;omebody be|hind
the&s;e Tape&s;tries, who, I fear, might
partake of the Secrets of my Heart. O!
what is it you fear,</HI> &s;aid the Dutche&s;s
Blu&s;hing; <HI>when nothing can di&s;turb you
here. I am &s;en&s;ible of that, Madam,</HI> &s;aid
that Prince, ca&s;ting a tender Look at
her, <HI>yet &s;hould I be ready to run di&s;tra|cted,
if any body had overheard me; for
Love being a nice Pa&s;&s;ion, I &s;hould lo&s;e
one half of my Plea&s;ure; Secre&s;y en|crea&s;es
<PB N="6" REF="10">
the Charms of Love, and 'tis in
her we mu&s;t &s;earch for our true Satisfa|ction.
I can't deny it to be &s;o,</HI> &s;aid the
Dutche&s;s &s;omewhat Di&s;compo&s;ed,
<HI>without the aid of Secre&s;y, Tenderne&s;s
is not very agreeable nor durable.</HI> One
of her Ladies coming in at the &s;ame
time to tell her, that the Duke of
<HI>O&mdash;s</HI> was a coming, they rejoyn'd
the re&s;t of the Company, and the King
appearing &s;omewhat di&s;turbed, pa&s;s'd
part of his time in reading a Book.
The next day following the King gave
a Ball, where all the Ladies appear'd
in their utmo&s;t Lu&s;tre, and the Dutch|e&s;s
of&mdash;in particular &s;urpa&s;s'd all
the re&s;t in her engaging Deportment.
The Duke of <HI>O&mdash;s,</HI> who had for &s;ome
time pa&s;t look'd upon the Counte&s;s of
<HI>Olone</HI> as the mo&s;t Aimable Per&s;on of
the Court, entertain'd her that Even|ing
with his Sighs and a thou&s;and o|bliging
Expre&s;&s;ions, to the no &s;mall
Mortification of Madam <HI>Monte&s;pan,</HI>
who had flatter'd her &s;elf with the
hopes of making that Prince her
Conque&s;t; but now &s;eeing him to
<PB N="7" REF="11">
make his Addre&s;&s;es to her, &s;he was rea|dy
to bur&s;t with &s;pite and envy a|gain&s;t
her Rival. That Prince un|willing
to act the Arbitrator betwixt
them, withdrew for &s;ome time, and
being a great Admirer of &s;trange Ad|ventures
and Stories, he &s;oon after
gave them a long Relation of the <HI>Em|peror
of the Sun,</HI> a Title a&s;&s;umed by a
certain pretended famous A&s;trologer,
reported to be come lately from the
<HI>Ea&s;t</HI> to <HI>Paris,</HI> to exerci&s;e his admira|ble
Art in <HI>France.</HI> The Prince of
<HI>Conde,&punc;</HI> whom the Duke of <HI>O&mdash;s</HI> had
made his Confident in this Matter,
told them &s;uch &s;urprizing Things of
this Great A&s;trologer, that the whole
Company began to &s;hew an Inclinati|on
of vi&s;iting him, each in particular,
to learn from him their good or ill
Fortune, except Madam <HI>de Olone,</HI>
who hated all &s;orts of Conjurers, be|cau&s;e
&s;he dreaded the Di&s;covery of
her Amorous Intrigues told the
Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> with a &s;cornful Air,
<HI>Alas! what is &s;uch an unhappy Wretch|able
to tell of tho&s;e that &s;ubmit them&s;elves
<PB N="8" REF="12">
to Providence? If he can &s;ay any thing
to the purpo&s;e he mu&s;t deal with the De|vil!
O! Madam,</HI> return'd the Prince,
<HI>this &s;tupendious Mortal erects the Horo|&s;cope
of the whole World, nothing can
be conceal'd from him, as well of what
is pa&s;t as what is to come. Then I will
take care,</HI> &s;aid &s;he to the Duke of
<HI>Candalle,</HI> who &s;tood hard by, <HI>how I
come near this</HI> Emperor of the Sun,
<HI>who dives thus far into the Secrets of all
the World. No, Madam,</HI> reply'd the
Duke with a plea&s;ant Air, <HI>you mu&s;t
go and &s;ee him, as well as the other La|dies,
this &s;urprizing A&s;trologer will per|haps
tell you &s;uch things as will highly
plea&s;e you. Sir,</HI> return'd the Counte&s;s
with a grave Air, <HI>People are &s;eldom
fond of being told of their Follies and
Misfortunes, &s;uch as the&s;e Wretches com|monly
&s;peak off. Who has made you be|lieve,
Madam,</HI> reply'd the Duke of
<HI>Candalle</HI> briskly, <HI>that you &s;hall be &V;n|fortunate?
Ladies &s;o hand&s;om as you,
have, mo&s;t commonly, Fortune at their
own Di&s;po&s;al, and &s;ail with a fair Gale
upon the Ocean of Felicity. Well, we will
<PB N="9" REF="13">
put it to the Tryal,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, interrupt|ing
the Duke, and &s;o went out of the
Room. The Count <HI>de Guiche</HI> hap|pening
to meet her alone in a very
pen&s;ive po&s;ture, in one of the Galle|ries,
whi&s;per'd her in the Ear, <HI>Fair
Hermit, afford me a &s;hare in your &s;oli|tary
Thoughts, and give me a place in
your Heart, for as long a time as you
have taken up in mine; What is it that
could engage you, to leave &s;o agreeable
an A&s;&s;embly to abandon your &s;elf to your
Melancholy Thoughts? I can't well tell
you,</HI> reply'd Madam <HI>de Olone</HI> carele&s;s,
<HI>I am &s;ometimes di&s;turbed at any
Company,</HI> added &s;he &s;ighing; <HI>All their
Di&s;cou$&s;e this Evening at Court runs
upon a certain Conjurer, who coming
from the</HI> Country of the Sun, <HI>can by
one's Phy&s;iognomy di&s;clo&s;e all our mo&s;t
hidden Thoughts, and determine our
De&s;tinies, as if he were beyond a Mor$al
Man.</HI> A certain A&s;trologer, &s;aid the
Count by way of Critici&s;m, <HI>don't you
know that the fir&s;t of the&s;e Words is &s;ure
and infallible, but the &s;econd is very un|certain.
I little trouble my head,</HI> reply'd
<PB N="10" REF="14">
the Counte&s;s with much indifferency,
<HI>about the &s;ignification of Words, I will
only tell you, Sir,</HI> continu'd this Fair
Lady h$lf angry, <HI>that I mortally hate all
the&s;e Animals call'd</HI> A&s;trologers, <HI>who
build Ca&s;tles in the Air, and pull them
down again at plea&s;ure. And I,</HI> reply'd
the Count coldly, <HI>love them dearly,
becau&s;e they &s;ometimes di&s;clo&s;e to us our
Happine&s;s: As for in&s;tance, if this God|like
Man &s;hould tell me that I was be|lov'd
by you, what a Satisfaction, what
a Joy would not that be to me? How,
Sir,</HI> reply'd the Counte&s;s, <HI>can't you
re&s;t contented with the Favours of the
mo&s;t Lovely Lady in the World, with|out
envying another Man's Happine&s;s,
and betraying your Infidelity?</HI> The
Count <HI>de Guiche</HI> finding him&s;elf alone
with Madam <HI>de Olone,</HI> whom at that
very in&s;tant he thought as hand&s;om
as an Angel by the Light of the Moon,
in&s;tead of an&s;wering was going to
embrace her, but &s;he di&s;engaging her
&s;elf out of his Arms, told him, <HI>Pray
an&s;wer me immediately, Do you always
improve the fir&s;t Opportunity? What
<PB N="11" REF="15">
would you have me tell you, O Incom|parable
Lady,</HI> cry'd he with a mo&s;t Pa&s;|&s;ionate
Air, <HI>Love tyranni&s;es over me
on all &s;ides. But tell me, Incon&s;tant Man,</HI>
continued the Counte&s;s with a Smile,
<HI>have not you, on your Knees, made a thou|&s;and
Vows to the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;to
Love her as long as you live, and to let
no body el&s;e have a &s;hare in your Tender|ne&s;s?
No, Madam,</HI> &s;aid the Count
with a Blu&s;h, <HI>I am not &s;o far advanced
as you imagine. Ah! &s;imple Man,</HI> cry'd
the Counte&s;s bur&s;ting out a Laughing,
<HI>he be$rays him&s;elf, are not tho&s;e Perfi|dious
Oaths, whereby you treacherous
Men triumph over our Liberty, the fir&s;t
&s;tep made by Lovers? Let us leave that
Cau&s;e, Madam,</HI> reply'd the Count, <HI>the
very Walls have Ears here; be&s;ides that,
this Lady is &s;oon tired with an old Lo|ver,
and it is above a Year &s;ince I have
made my Addre&s;&s;es to her, which me$
with no favourable Reception. Sir, you
are a Man of Honour,</HI> &s;aid the Coun|te&s;s
with a malicious Smile, <HI>your Di&s;|cretion
de&s;erves to be rewarded by the
Ladies, who can't be&s;tow their Favours
<PB N="12" REF="16">
upon a more de&s;erving Per&s;on than you.
Then let me have &s;ome &s;hare in yours,</HI> re|ply'd
the Count tran&s;ported with
Pa&s;&s;ion, and ki&s;&s;ing her Hands, <HI>Per|mit
me, Madam,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>to Love you,
and to tell you, that I do &s;o, if you
intend to make me happy. Alas! Dear</HI>
Count, return'd Madam <HI>de Olone,</HI> with
a langui&s;hing Air, <HI>let us not talk of
Loving, I tremble at the very Name of
Love, being &s;en&s;ible how dearly I have
paid for it, and what&mdash;And &s;o
do I,</HI> &s;aid the Duke <HI>de Candalles,</HI> in|terrupting
them (having left the Room
where they Danced, on purpo&s;e to &s;ee
what was become of her) <HI>I thought it
could be no le&s;s than a Nocturnal A&s;&s;ig|nation,
that robb'd us of your Company;
a very fine piece indeed, for a Vertuous
Lady,</HI> continued he, <HI>to be catch'd &s;in|gled
from the Company with &s;o di&s;creet
a Per&s;on that never brags of the $adies
Favours. But after all, unle&s;s you have
a mind to be &s;een al&s;o by others, your
be&s;t way is, to chu&s;e a more &s;olitary
place, &s;uch a one as may be more &s;uita|ble
to your pre&s;ent Intentions. &V;nfor|tunate
<PB N="13" REF="17">
Woman as I am,</HI> cry'd the Coun|te&s;s
in a Surprize, <HI>I know not what &s;e|cret
Sentiments foreboded to me your
unju&s;t Jealou&s;ie, 'twas no more than an
accidental Meeting, you make &s;uch a
noi&s;e about: Great God, how unfortu|nate
am I, to meet with nothing but what
are my Enemies, where ever I come!</HI>
And &s;o leaving the Duke and Count
together in the Gallery, went into
the Queen's Apartment, who ask'd
her where &s;he had been. <HI>I have been,</HI>
&s;aid &s;he to her Maje&s;ty, with a mo&s;t
re&s;pectful Air, <HI>in one of the Galleries,
to take a little fre&s;h Air;</HI> and the Queen,
who was one of the be&s;t natur'd Prin|ce&s;&s;es
in the World, made no fa: ther
enquiry into the Matter. The two
Gentlemen, having given one another
an account of their Adventures, laugh|ed
at the oddne&s;s of the thing, and &s;o
parted.</P>
<P>The Count <HI>de Guiche</HI> &s;oon re-a&s;&s;u|ming
his wonted &s;erious Air and Sighs,
placed him&s;elf behind the Dutche&s;s
of&mdash;Chair, and &s;he who had not
&s;een him &s;ince he was forced to get
<PB N="14" REF="18">
away out of the Clo&s;et for fear of the
King, &s;oon perceiving him, and turn|ing
her &s;elf towards him with an En|gaging
Air, <HI>Where have you been Count,</HI>
&s;aid &s;he, <HI>'tis &s;ome Years &s;ince I have not
&s;een you. Madam,</HI> reply'd the Count
<HI>de Guiche</HI> with a profound re&s;pect, <HI>I
was afraid of being too trouble&s;ome. A
weak rea&s;on indeed,</HI> return'd the Dutch|e&s;s
of&mdash;<HI>Come, tell me without
di&s;&s;embling the Matter, What is it that
has fix'd the&s;e doleful melancholy Sym|ptoms
in your Eyes and Countenance?</HI>
The King happening to enter the
Room at the &s;ame time, their Di&s;|cour&s;e
and the whole Company broke
off at the &s;ame time, and their Royal
Highne&s;&s;es return'd to the <HI>Palace
Royal.</HI></P>
<P>However, the Duke of <HI>O&mdash;s</HI> per|&s;i&s;ting
in his Re&s;olutions of acting the
A&s;trologer at Court, told the Prince
of <HI>Conde,</HI> who was to introduce him,
that his Feminine Voice and Air would
&s;erve him in good &s;tead, to pur&s;ue
his de&s;ign of erecting the Horo&s;cope
of &s;ome Ladies, but that he was at a
<PB N="15" REF="19">
&s;tand how to di&s;gui&s;e his Face. <HI>Don't
trouble your &s;elf upon that Score, Dear
Cou&s;in,</HI> &s;aid the Prince Laughing, <HI>do
you your be&s;t, and leave the re&s;t to
Chance.</HI> The Duke approved of the
Prince's Advice with a Smile, and &s;o
they went the &s;ame Day to St. <HI>Clou,</HI>
where his Highne&s;s had prepared a
magnificent Fea&s;t, with all manner of
Diver&s;ions for the Entertainment of
the Court. Night being come, and
our pretended A&s;trologer having e|very
thing in readine&s;s for his Di&s;|gui&s;e,
told the Company, That being
troubled with the Head-ach, he would
take an Hour or two's re&s;t; and he
being then in an ill Humour, every
Body was glad to &s;ee him gone. He
was no &s;ooner gone into an adjacent
room, but he put on his Di&s;gui&s;ing
Apparel, being a large Robe of Blue
Cloath embroidered with Suns, Moons
and Stars, and a Turbant of various
Colours upon his Head, with a long
reddi&s;h curl'd Beard and a Gla&s;s Eye
that cover'd all the remaining part
of his Face, attended by the Duke of
<PB N="16" REF="20">
<HI>Longueville,</HI> who was no le&s;s di&s;gui&s;ed
than him&s;elf: He wore a Gown and
Ve&s;t of a Violet Colour, with great
hanging Sleeves, after the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Fa|&s;hion;
a large Pearl fa&s;tned to the tip
of his No&s;e, and he had fal&s;e Ears as
long as tho&s;e of King <HI>Midas,</HI> and in
his Hands a &s;mall Box containing Re|medies
again&s;t all Di&s;tempers. In this
Equipage the Duke of <HI>O&mdash;s</HI> entred the
Appartment where the Lords and La|dies
were, and no &s;ooner did the
Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> get &s;ight of the <HI>Em|peror
of the Sun,</HI> but he cry'd, the <HI>God
of Light</HI> is appearing, and ri&s;ing to
meet him, conducted him to an El|bow-Chair,
brought in for that pur|po&s;e.
Never was any Surprize like
this, the whole Court gazing upon
one another, without &s;aying one
word, and the Duke of <HI>O&mdash;s</HI> ca&s;ting
his mo&s;t furious and daring Looks on
all &s;ides, muttered &s;everal unintelligi|ble
Words, &s;ometimes lifting up a lit|tle

at this &s;ight, ask'd the Prince of
<HI>Conde,</HI> whether this A&s;trologer could
&s;peak <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French? Yes, yes,
Madam,</HI> an&s;wer'd the Necromancer,
making many wry Faces, <HI>I am &s;uffi|ciently
acquainted with your De&s;tiny,
to let you know what you are de&s;irous to
be &s;atisfy'd in. I &s;hould be very glad
to hear that, Sir,</HI> &s;aid the Prince&s;s, <HI>is
it po&s;&s;ible you &s;hould be able to dive into
the &s;ecret De&s;tinies of Men? Very Well,
Madam,</HI> reply'd the Dukeof <HI>O&mdash;s</HI> in a
mild Tone, <HI>I foretold</HI> Charles I. <HI>King
of</HI> England, <HI>all his Misfortunes. Then
you have been at</HI> London, reply'd the
Dutche&s;s of&mdash;much &s;urpriz'd,
<HI>How Old pray were you when you fore|told
this Prince his Misfortune? Alas!
why would not you put him in the way
to avoid them? You ask me, Madam,
if I have been at</HI> London, reply'd the
A&s;trologer in a feign'd Surprize, <HI>me,
who am able to run the whole Circuit of
the Earth in a Minute, and what Age
I am off? A fine Question indeed to an</HI>
Emperor of the Sun, <HI>who&s;e Subjects
continue for ever in the &s;ame &s;tate of
<PB N="18" REF="22">
Youth; I was then of the &s;ame Age,</HI>
continu'd he, turning his Gla&s;s Eye
on both &s;ides, <HI>I am now in. How,
Sir,</HI> &s;aid the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;
Laughing, <HI>are you not &s;ubject to Age
and its Infirmities, which puts an end
to even the mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd things in
this World. Madam,</HI> &s;aid the Duke of
<HI>O&mdash;s</HI> with an Au&s;tere Voice, <HI>I am
forbidden by the Stars, to enlarge my
&s;elf upon this Point, as well as to go
about to prevent tho&s;e Evils mortal Men
are threatned with by the Planets.</HI>
Charles I. <HI>has fulfill'd the Scheme of
his De&s;tiny, as other Mortals do, its
Decrees being irrevocable, and directed
by Providence. And Sir,</HI> reply'd the
Dutche&s;s of&mdash;&s;ighing, <HI>can you
ca&s;t my Nativity, by the permi&s;&s;ion of the
Stars? I promi&s;e you, I will, Madam,</HI>
an&s;wer'd the di&s;gui&s;ed Duke with his
Eyes fix'd on the Ground, <HI>but it mu&s;t
be done without Witne&s;&s;es, and you mu&s;t
put an entire Confidence in my Predicti|ons.
Suppo&s;ing they &s;hould be fatal, Sir,</HI>
reply'd the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;with
a melancholy Air, <HI>mu&s;t I give ab&s;olute
<PB N="19" REF="23">
Credit to them? But be it as it will,</HI>
continued &s;he, <HI>I will take Courage and
lead the way.</HI> The A&s;trologer then be|ing
conducted into a Clo&s;et, where
&s;everal Lights were burning, the
Dutche&s;s of&mdash;follow'd him
thither alone, not doubting but that
&s;he might tru&s;t her Per&s;on without
the lea&s;t hazard, with a Per&s;on of &s;o
advanced an Age. The fir&s;t thing the
Necromancer did, was to examine her
Phy&s;iognomy; which done, he told
her with a mild Air, <HI>Charming Lady,
'tis not &s;urprizing to &s;ee you di&s;pute with
the Angels them&s;elves for the Beauties
both of Mind and Body; when I con&s;i|der

by</HI> Jupiter <HI>and</HI> Mars, <HI>who&mdash;Alas!
Sir,</HI> &s;aid the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;in|terrupting
him, <HI>pray &s;peak to me in a
more intelligible Language, that I may

be able to under&s;tand you, let us not
trouble our &s;elves with the Stars, but
with the good and ill Accidents of my
Life; with tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions that exerci&s;e
their Dominion over the Hearts of
Mankind. I mu&s;t rightly examine your
Con&s;titution, which to all appearance is
endued with all the Qualities requi&s;ite to
render your Health compleat, and your
Inclination very good. The Eyes, as a
$ertain Great Author ob&s;erves, are the
Lookingla&s;s of the Soul, for which rea|&s;on,
Nature has thought fit to place them
in the uppermo&s;t part of Creatures, to
&s;erve as faithful Interpreters of what
is in our Hearts. Mo&s;t common|ly
Women that have Blue and Lan|gui&s;hing
Eyes, &s;uch as yours, have a|bundance
of Wit and Good Nature, and
al&s;o much Tenderne&s;s, and are &s;carce
proof again&s;t the great Qualifications
and Merits of a Lover. Fair and
curl'd Hairs, are a &s;ign that their In|clinations
are Vertuous and for good
Actions: A Fair and Vermillion Com|plexion,
is the Herald who proclaims all
the Indications of a perfect good Tem|perature,

and who animates our Vital
Spirits by a &s;ufficient &s;hare of Natural
Heat. The Prince of Philo&s;ophers, as
well as all the Phy&s;iognomi&s;ts agree in
this, That a round No&s;e di&s;covers a
certain Inclination to Plea&s;ures and hu|man
Tenderne&s;s. O! my mo&s;t Admi|rable
and and almo&s;t Divine Man,</HI> cry'd
the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;interrupting
him, <HI>is it in your Power to tell me
&s;omething concerning the true &s;tate of
my Heart? Yes, Madam,</HI> reply'd he,
drawing his Gla&s;s-Eye a little on
one &s;ide, <HI>you are prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd with a
&s;trong Pa&s;&s;ion for a certain Gentleman,
which makes you not to be very fond of
that Spou&s;e Heaven has bestow'd upon
you; but if you continue &s;o to do, I fore|&s;ee
by the Stars, $word$ fatality that will
attend both you and him who adores
you. 'Tis enough, Sir,</HI> &s;aid the Dutche&s;s
of&mdash;, and &s;o went out of the
Clo&s;et, fearing lea&s;t he &s;hould tell her
more than &s;he was willing to hear,
and returning to the Apartment
where the Company was told them,
not without &s;ome di&s;turbance, <HI>O!
<PB N="22" REF="26">
what a skilful Necromancer! This &s;tu|pendious
Man very well de&s;erves the In|cen&s;es
offer'd him by all the World; he
no &s;ooner &s;aw me, but knew part of my
Inclinations; but what is more &s;urpri|zing,
and even beyond what is well to

<P>The Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI> who had

Duke acted that Part, would needs
be the next who &s;hould make tryal

Floor; <HI>Yes, yes, I &s;hall,</HI> reply'd the
Count abruptly, <HI>your Sentences are no
Oracles, a Man is bound to receive

Power that governs our Fortunes; Know
then, ambitious Man,</HI> added the A|&s;trologer
with a &s;cornful Air, <HI>that I

Con&s;equences of &s;o dangerous an Engage|ment,
which will prove the Ruine of
thy Fortune.</HI> The Duke of <HI>O&mdash;s</HI>
was ready to bur&s;t with Laughing un|der
his long red Beard, to have put
the Count in &s;uch a Fright, for he
had no kindne&s;s for him, becau&s;e he
would always be at the Dutche&s;&s;es
Elbow, &s;o he turn'd his Back to him,
as if he had no more to &s;ay to him,
but in effect, for fear of being di&s;|covered
&s;ooner than he de&s;igned.
The Count went out of the Clo&s;et
very much di&s;&s;atisfy'd, and as pale
as if he had been at the la&s;t Ga&s;p,
and returning to the Ladies, told
them, That <HI>if all the A&s;trologers were
as impudent as this Fellow, they would
have but few Cu&s;tomers. This famous
Necromancer has told me abundance of
Stories, which I look upon no otherwi&s;e
than Phanta&s;ms; the old Fool, as far
as I can &s;ee, hates Men like Mon&s;ters,

Pray what has he told you, Sir,</HI> cry'd
Madam <HI>d' Olone, what is it that vexes

as much dejected as the</HI> Hugenot. <HI>He

Count very much di&s;turb'd, <HI>a thou|&s;and
things, which he put what Inter|pretation

reply'd the Counte&s;s Laughing, <HI>I will
for once &s;et a&s;ide my aver&s;ion to Conju|rers,

this incomparable Man will tell me.
Madam,</HI> return'd the Count merrily,

and Jealou&s;ie are in&s;eparable Compa|nions,
and that true Love can ad|mit
of no Partner&s;hip. <HI>Alas, Sir,</HI>
reply'd &s;he, <HI>don't crack my Brains
with &s;uch like premeditated Di&s;cour&s;es,
wherewith you think to en&s;nare me; no,
I am re&s;olved to throw off your Fet|ters,
and will never pardon that &s;ignal
Affront you put upon me before the Count</HI>
de Guiche, <HI>who mu&s;t certainly take me
for a &s;trange Creature. Madam, be not
di&s;turbed,</HI> &s;aid the Duke, endeavour|ing
to embrace her, <HI>I took care to ex|plain
the matter to him, and my Anger
was of no long continuance. How im|portunate
you are,</HI> reply'd Madam <HI>d'
Olone,</HI> with much Indifferency, <HI>let me
alone, withdraw from hence, and bid
me farewel for ever. How, Cruel &V;n|grateful
Woman,</HI> &s;aid our di&s;&s;atisfy'd
Lover interrupting her, and pretend|ing
to be much more concern'd than
<PB N="35" REF="39">
actually he was, <HI>will you reduce me to
De&s;pair, and not afford me your Par|don!
I am ready to expiate my Fault
before your Eyes, in &s;pite of all you can
do.</HI> He had no &s;ooner &s;aid tho&s;e
Words, but drawing his Sword with
much eagerne&s;s, he was going to
thru&s;t the Point into his Bo&s;om;
but alas! Who is able to expre&s;s the
real Sentiments of the Counte&s;s at
the &s;ight of &s;o violent and &s;o fatal a
Re&s;olution, &s;he ca&s;t her &s;elf betwixt
her Lover's Sword and Body, &s;he
Ki&s;s'd, &s;he Care&s;s'd him; and at la&s;t,
getting the Sword out of his Hands,
remon&s;trated to him the heinou&s;ne&s;s
of the Sin he intended to commit, in
making attempt upon his own Life.
The Duke, who was well acquainted
with the Accompli&s;hments of Gallan|try,
and knew all the Roads leading
to the Empire of Love, was much
plea&s;ed with him&s;elf, for having &s;o
well &s;ucceeded in his de&s;ign of find|ing
out the Endearments of his Mi|&s;tre&s;s,
and to act his Part to the ut|mo&s;t
perfection, pretended not to
<PB N="36" REF="40">
hearken to her Councils, but to per|&s;i&s;t
in his former Re&s;olution. Ma|dam
<HI>d' Olone</HI> oppo&s;ed him with all
her might, crying to him, <HI>My Dear,
I pardon you a thou&s;and times, whate|ver
you have committed again&s;t me;
Pre&s;erve a Life that is &s;o precious to
me, let us enjoy the Fruits rather of
a delightful Peace, than &s;ee the dread
of a terrible Death, which would rob us
for ever of the Charms and Delights
that attend Lovers: Alas!</HI> continu|ed
the Counte&s;s ca&s;ting a tender
glance at him, and &s;queezing his
Hands, <HI>the very Idea of what you was
going about, has &s;omething very dread|ful
and melancholy in it. Then, Ma|dam,</HI>
reply'd the Duke, like one ama|zed
and recovered out of a Swoon,
<HI>you would have me live, to love you the
longer, and to be yours more than ever?
Yes, my Dear Duke,</HI> reply'd &s;he, ha|ving
her Arms about his Neck, <HI>let
us Love for ever, let no Quarrels di|&s;turb
our Love for the future, Di&s;&s;enti|ons
betwixt Lovers do not reli&s;h with
me, a plea&s;ing &V;nion has much more
<PB N="37" REF="41">
Charms and Delights. I can't deny it,
my Incomparable Lady,</HI> &s;aid the Duke
<HI>de Candalle</HI> with a more contented
Air, <HI>neverthele&s;s it &s;eems almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible,
but that a certain mixture of
Jealou&s;ie and Fear of lo&s;ing the only
Object of our de&s;ires will intervene,
when we lea&s;t think of it. It &s;eems as
if Love were attended by certain Vexa|tions
and Mi&s;chiefs which are unavoid|able,
like all things in this World have
their allays of bitterne&s;s, which almo&s;t
reduce us to De&s;pair, and bring us to
the brink of Ruine.</HI> The Counte&s;s by
this time &s;eeing her Gallant recover|ed
from his Tragical Re&s;olution,
told him with a Smile, <HI>Pray Sir, tell
me &s;incerely, were you actually re&s;olved
to die, or was it only a feign'd de&s;ign
$o frighten and to draw a &s;incere Con|fe&s;&s;ion
from me? My Re&s;olution was
for the fir&s;t, my Dear,</HI> &s;aid the Duke,
acting the &s;incere part to the Life,
<HI>&s;ince you refu&s;ed either to &s;ee or to hear
me: What plea&s;ure do you think, Ma|dam,
can a Man po&s;&s;e&s;s$d with a &s;trong
Pa&s;&s;ion find in the World, after being
<PB N="38" REF="42">
bani&s;h'd his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Thoughts and
Pre&s;ence? For my part I think there is
no pain comparable to this, and there|fore
nothing but Sword or Dagger can
deliver us from &s;uch in&s;upportable Tor|ments.
As far as I can &s;ee, Duke,</HI> re|ply'd
the Counte&s;s Laughing aloud,
<HI>you love like the Heroes in the Roman|ces,
that is to &s;ay, you would &s;hare the
&s;ame fate with the &V;nfortunate</HI> Pyra|mus,
<HI>who kill'd him&s;elf, unle&s;s &s;ome
charitable</HI> Thysbe, <HI>&s;tops your Hand;
and who could &s;ee a Lover in &s;uch a
furious Re&s;olution, without oppo&s;ing his
Violence? But without je&s;ting, I am
apt to believe, you acted the dead, ra|ther
the dying Man only in your ima|gination,
as a certain Lover did, re|pre&s;ented
in a Picture on the top of a
Mountain, with a pale Countenance in
a langui&s;hing Condition, with the point
of his Dagger towards his Brea&s;t, be|cau&s;e
his Mi&s;tre&s;s would &s;ee him no more
than twice a Day, and had refu&s;ed him
certain Flowers &s;he had wore in her
Bo&s;om.</HI> The Duke, who&s;e Pain and
Trouble was only in outward ap|pearance,
<PB N="39" REF="43">
could not forbear Laugh|ing
outright, to &s;ee how naturally he
had acted his part, whereat the
Counte&s;s was &s;o di&s;plea&s;ed, that &s;he
told him with an Air full of Anger
and Indifferency, <HI>Sir, you think per|haps
I don't di&s;cern your Deportment,
for a Per&s;on who pretends to make me
&s;en&s;ible, that he owes me &hellip;.</HI>
The Duke perceiving his charming
Mi&s;tre&s;s di&s;contented, thought fit to
give her no further cau&s;e of Vexati|on,
but on a &s;udden turning his
Mirth into Sighs and Complaints,
threw him&s;elf at her Feet, conjuring
her by all the mo&s;t tender Expre&s;&s;i|ons
that could be, to Love him for
ever, and not to be di&s;quieted at
the&s;e in&s;ignificant Trifles, which
Love, (who is a Child for ever) puts
upon even the mo&s;t re&s;erved of his
Subjects. The Counte&s;s overcome
by the Arguments of her Lover made
him &s;en&s;ible by an engaging Smile,
that a Woman has but little &s;trength
to re&s;i&s;t the Tenderne&s;s of him &s;he
Loves, and that her natural Inclina|tions
<PB N="40" REF="44">
prompt her to pardon in him
the wor&s;t of Faults, in &s;pite of a thou|&s;and
Rea&s;ons and all her Vertues,
which oppo&s;e them and &s;tand up in
her defence. At la&s;t, the&s;e two illu|&s;trious
Lovers, after &s;o agreeable a
Reconciliation, entertain'd one ano|ther
with the mo&s;t tender and mo&s;t
charming Words that can be &s;uppo|&s;ed
to proceed from two Hearts
newly re-united, and the Counte&s;s
touch'd to the quick by the Duke's
Care&s;&s;es, had a mind to pu&s;h on the
Conver&s;ation to a much higher and
more agreeable Point, had her Lo|ver
improved his Opportunity on the
&s;pot, and had they not been di&s;ap|pointed
by an unfore&s;een Accident.
For while they were entertaining one
$span$ the Counte&s;&s;es Husband came
home, $long with the Marqui&s;s of
&hellip;.. his intimate Friend;
wi$h an intention to &s;hew him his
Lady's Picture that hung in her Clo|&s;e$,
where the Duke and Counte&s;s
were look'd together at the &s;ame
time; no &s;ooner heard they &s;ome
<PB N="41" REF="45">
Body at the Door, but the Coun|te&s;s,
tho almo&s;t half dead with fear,
ran that way, and <HI>My dear Honey, my
&s;weet Child,</HI> &s;aid &s;he to him, <HI>pray
make no noi&s;e, my little Bitch is Pup|ping
and full of pain, &s;he has not re&s;ted
a Minute all this Night, and wants a
little Sleep.</HI> The Count fell a Laugh|ing
at the affectionate Air of his La|dy
for her <HI>Jolley,</HI> and to plea&s;e her,
went into another Room with the
Marqui&s;s, whither the Picture was
brought to be viewed by them,
whil&s;t <HI>Jolley</HI> was in Labour; &s;he had
&s;oon after three very fine Puppies,
and the Duke took the fir&s;t Opportu|nity
of &s;ecuring them. The Counte&s;s
took care to have the Bitch with her
Puppies carry'd into the Clo&s;et;
which done, &s;he left the Door open
and going into the Room where her
Husband and the Marqui&s;s were walk|ing
together. <HI>Well, Madam,</HI> &s;aid
the Count, perceiving his Lady to
be in a good Humour&punc; <HI>how does</HI> Jolley
<HI>do? Have you &s;ent for a Midwife?
My Lord,</HI> reply'd &s;he &s;miling, <HI>there
<PB N="42" REF="46">
is no need for one, &s;he has brought forth
three charming Puppies. Poor little
Creature,</HI> cry'd the Count <HI>d' Olone,
Nature has taken care to deliver her of
her Pain.</HI> The Count and his Friend
&s;pent &s;ome Hours at play, and in the
mean while the Counte&s;s returning
into her Clo&s;et, writ the following
Letter to the Duke of <HI>Candalle.</HI></P>
<P>&startq;'TIS impo&s;&s;ible for me, dear
Duke, to forbear Laughing
at every turn, when I reflect upon
the Method I made u&s;e of to im|po&s;e
upon my Good, Lovely and
Credulous Spou&s;e, who is the be&s;t
qualify'd Husband for our Times,
when hand&s;ome Women make it
their Bu&s;ine&s;s to try their Husbands
Goodne&s;s by their Conver&s;ation
with others: Ala&s;s! 'tis impo&s;&s;ible
to expre&s;s my fear for you, when
I &s;aw the Count at the Clo&s;et-door,
but thanks to Heaven, who &s;o un|expectedly
has delivered me from
this danger, and upon the &s;o ha|zardous
an occa&s;ion, I am convin|ed,
<PB N="43" REF="47">
that Love protects and crowns
my &s;incere Intentions in re&s;pect to
you. Come then, my Dear, let us
enjoy the Fruits of our good For|tune
this Evening; whil&s;t my lit|tle
Spou&s;e is abroad, we will make
our &s;elves an amends for the delay
he has given us; and endeavour to
encrea&s;e what we have grafted on
his Head: Adieu, I expect your
coming by the Light of the Moon,
in my little Bed-Chamber, pray
come without making the lea&s;t
noi&s;e; My Woman <HI>Ayme</HI> will let
you in, and take care to per&s;wade
the good Man, my Spou&s;e, that I
lie with the Marchione&s;s of &hellip;.
You may be &s;ure I always am, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Candalle,</HI> who was
not a little unea&s;ie to know how
things had been carry'd on at the
Counte&s;&s;es &s;ince his Ab&s;ence, was o|verjoy'd
at the &s;ight, and reading of
this Letter, the Contents whereof be|ing
very advantageous to him, he
returned the following An&s;wer.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="48">
Madam,</P>
<P>&startq;IF you were well plea&s;ed with
the Game you play'd your Love|ly
Spou&s;e, I have no le&s;s rea&s;on to
be &s;atisfy'd, to &s;ee my &s;elf thus
happily delivered of his un&s;ea&s;ona|ble
Pre&s;ence. Certainly nothing
can be more trouble&s;ome, than a
Husband who interrupts the En|joyments;
and by his pre&s;ence di|&s;turbs
the A&s;&s;ignations of Lovers.
My Dear, I am a thou&s;and times
more taken with your Merits now,
than ever I was before, and there|fore
&s;hould almo&s;t run di&s;tracted, if
this Night, whil&s;t we are together,
the good Man &s;hould come in, and
break the edge of my Sword, which
is not at all times ready for action;
improve the Opportunity to the
utmo&s;t, I will not fail to be at the
appointed place; and in the mean
while am a doing what you know,
that is, I am preparing to receive
your Commands, and to do my be&s;t
to &hellip;. and to give you
<PB N="45" REF="49">
full &s;atisfaction, for what I &s;tand
indebted to you, that I may have
no Reproaches from you on that
account: Adieu, Madam, you are
too much concern'd in the Matter,
to give me any Abatement.&endq;</P>
<P>'Twas not long after the Delivery
of the Letter, the Duke came and
&s;tay'd all Night with Madam <HI>d' Olone,</HI>
who about &s;ix a Clock the next
Morning, di&s;gui&s;ed in a Gentleman's
Habit, came to the Marchione&s;s of
&hellip;. where having &s;tay'd for
&s;ome &s;mall time, &s;he came home a|gain,
and entertain'd the good Man,
with a thou&s;and little Stories, &s;uch
as &s;he thought mo&s;t &s;uitable to divert
him from taking any in&s;ight into her
Conduct.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>O&mdash;s,</HI> who had left
her without taking his leave of her,
came to give her another Vi&s;it the
&s;ame Afternoon, their Conver&s;ation
was full of Tenderne&s;s, but without
coming to the Point, and her Hus|band
being at home that Evening,
<PB N="46" REF="50">
the Duke as he was returning to his
Palace, met upon the Stair-ca&s;e which
leads to the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;Lodg|ings
the Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI> who in all
probability de&s;cending from the Hill
of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> was wrapt up in a
Scarlet Cloak, and pa&s;s'd by clo&s;e to
the Duke without &s;peaking one
word, perhaps the Lovely God,
who pre&s;ided in that place, had en|joyn'd
him to Secrefie. The Duke
who knew him, was &s;o far exa&s;pe|rated
at this bold and unaccountable
Deportment of the Count, that the
next day he made his Complaints
thereof to the King, in &s;uch pre&s;&s;ing
and lively terms, that his Maje&s;ty
could not forbear to compa&s;&s;ionate
his Ca&s;e, and looking &s;tedfa&s;t upon
the young Duke, whom he knew to
love the Dutche&s;s his Spou&s;e in a
mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate Manner, this Mo|narch
told him with a free Air: <HI>Sir,
had you no Attendance along with you,
when you met him, why did you not
cau&s;e him to be thrown out of the Win|dow;
Be at re&s;t &s;ome time longer, if
<PB N="47" REF="51">
he continues in his Impudence, I know
how to rid my Hands of him, and how
to teach him, what re&s;pect is due to a
Per&s;on of your Rank.</HI> The Duke of
<HI>O&mdash;s,</HI> who always abounds in fri|volous
Arguments, teez'd the King
for &s;everal Hours after, dwelling con|tinually
upon the &s;ame Subject, till
at la&s;t he told him with a Smile:
<HI>Duke of</HI> O&mdash;s <HI>be &s;atisfied with what I
have promi&s;ed you, I am &s;en&s;ible you
mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionately Love your Spou&s;e, you
have given &s;ome proofs of it even to
my &s;elf, before you Marry'd her, but
you may be a&s;&s;ured I will find a way to
give you &s;atisfaction, and remove your
Enemies at a greater di&s;tance. 'Tis
true, Sir,</HI> reply'd the Duke with a
more a&s;&s;ured Countenance, <HI>I have a
thou&s;and Ob&s;ervations to your Goodne&s;s,
but you know there is no Love without
&s;ome Intermixture of Jealou&s;ie. I know
it very well,</HI> reply'd the King with a
Smile, <HI>but be at re&s;t, I will talk to the
Dutche&s;s if you think fit, and to the
Mare&s;chal</HI> de Grammont, <HI>to keep his
Son at home, and provide him an A|mu&s;ment
<PB N="48" REF="52">
&s;uitable to his Inclinations, or
el&s;e I will &s;end him in the Quality of
my Envoy into</HI> Poland, <HI>to Compliment
that King upon his Acce&s;&s;ion to the
Throne. This la&s;t Expedient, Sir,</HI> &s;aid
the Duke &s;miling, <HI>is the be&s;t of all,
but knowing you to bare a great Re&s;pect
to the Mar&s;hal his Father, you will be
very unwilling to per&s;i&s;t in that Re&s;olu|tion.
Not &s;o much as you think for,</HI>
with an engaging Air, <HI>when it is to
do you &s;ervice, to &s;top at nothing; and
were it not that I am unwilling to have
&s;o nice a matter to make a noi&s;e in the
World, and what I am apt to believe,
the Dutche&s;&s;es Complai&s;ance for this bold
Fellow not to have exceeded the limits
of Indifferency, I would &s;oon give you
very convincing Proofs of it.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>O&mdash;s</HI> appear'd well
&s;atisfy'd with what the King had told
him, who conducted him into the
Queen's Apartment, where the Dut|che&s;s
was then playing at Cards with
&s;everal other Ladies. Madam <HI>de
Monte&s;pan</HI> no &s;ooner &s;aw the Duke
of <HI>O&mdash;s</HI> come into the Room, but &s;he
<PB N="49" REF="53">
told him with a very plea&s;ant Air,
<HI>Sir, You mu&s;t come in with us, becau&s;e
whenever you are not on my &s;ide, I am
&s;ure to lo&s;e, one would almo&s;t believe
you playd booty to let me win. I am
ready to joyn with the Company,</HI> re|ply'd
the Duke, with a very Compli|&s;ant
Air, <HI>there is a great deal of Plea|&s;ure
and Satisfaction in playing with
&s;uch Fair Ladies as you are.</HI></P>
<P>Whil&s;t they were taken up a$
Cards, the King went out of the
Room to Vi&s;it Madam <HI>La Valiere,</HI>
who was then very Ill. This Mo|narch
would &s;it a whole Day toge|ther
at her Bed&s;ide, to give her rei|terated
a&s;&s;urances of the Force of his
Love, and Ardour of his Pa&s;&s;ion;
never was there a more &s;trict Union,
or &s;o well cemented a Pa&s;&s;ion &s;een
betwixt Lovers.</P>
<P><HI>The Count</HI> de Guiche, <HI>who dur&s;t
not appear at Court ever &s;ince his
meeting the Duke of</HI> O&mdash;s <HI>upon the
Stair-ca&s;e, was almo&s;t reduced to De|&s;pair,
the only thing that afforded
him &s;ome Con&s;olations, was, when
<PB N="50" REF="54">
he found the Duke of</HI> O&mdash;s <HI>to make
his Addre&s;&s;es to the Marchione&s;s of</HI>
Monte&s;pan; <HI>this made him tell one
of his Friends, who brought him the
fir&s;t News of it:</HI> If I could but once
&s;ee him enter into an Intrigue with a
Lady, I am a happy Man; when he is
once engaged in an Amorous Amu&s;ement,
he will have no lei&s;ure to think of inter|rupting
my Satisfaction by his Pre&s;ence.
Alas, Sir, <HI>reply'd his Friend,</HI> you are
not &s;o &s;ecure of this Good Fortune, as
you imagine. I am too well acquainted
with his Temper, he never is in earne&s;t
with Ladies, he loves only to act the
Lover in outward &s;hew, and to be re|puted
a Man of Gallantry, and what
are the Ladies much the better for that?
You are altogether in the right of it,
Sir, <HI>reply'd the Count with a &s;erious
Air,</HI> 'tis a hard matter to find out his
Temper and Inclinations. Not &s;o hard
neither us you thing for, <HI>&s;aid the Che|valier
with a Smile,</HI> first of all, he is
Jealous without Love, can keep a Secret,
and &s;ays little, full of Su&s;picion and a
great Di&s;&s;embler, and you know what
<PB N="51" REF="55">
el&s;e. Yes, I under&s;tand your meaning,
Sir, <HI>an&s;wered the Count,</HI> and be&s;ides
this, he never pardons a Fault. I am
quite lo&s;t in his Favour, &s;ince our meet|ing
upon the Stair-ca&s;e. You u&s;ed to
be very intimate together, <HI>return'd the
Chevalier,</HI> this was a &s;udden Rupture,
and perhaps he has forgot it by this time.
O, Sir, I find you are but little ac|quainted
with his Humour, <HI>&s;aid the
angry Count interrupting him,</HI> he
has the be&s;t Memory of any Man li|ving,
e&s;pecially if he bear a Grudge to
any Body, he takes a particular Plea|&s;ure
in not forgetting the lea&s;t thing in
the World. The Dutche&s;s of&mdash;unto
swhom I am not altogether indiffe|rent,
has told me &s;o a thou&s;and times.
A <HI>Propos</HI> to the Dutche&s;s, my dear
Friend, <HI>reply'd the Chevalier with
much eagerne&s;s,</HI> I think you are the
happie&s;t Man in the World, to &s;tand &s;o
well in the Heart and Opinion of &s;o
Charming a Lady, &s;o Adorable &s;o Ami|able
a Per&s;on, I can never look at her

Air, which challenges and van|qui&s;hes
<PB N="52" REF="56">
the Hearts of all &s;uch as &s;ee her;
but alas! This is a dangerous and &s;lip|pery
Path to venture upon. I am too
&s;en&s;ible of it, my dear Friend, <HI>an&s;wer|ed
the Count</HI> de Guiche <HI>with a deep
Sigh,</HI> but if it &s;hould co&s;t me my Life,
I will not retreat, my Flame is too pure
ever to &s;uffer me to repent of it; let
wor&s;t come to the wor&s;t, I can but &s;poil
my Fortune, <HI>continued he rubbing his
Forehead,</HI> and, after all, &s;ome certain
Charming Eyes flatter me at every turn,
that I &s;hall continue for ever in the &s;ame
happy State. Don't put too much Con|fidence,
Sir, in &s;uch Chimerical and
deceitful Notions, <HI>added the Cheva|lier,</HI>
Fortune and Love are very fickle
and incon&s;tant, the be&s;t way to &s;ecure
your Repo&s;e, will be to leave off an In|trigue,
the Con&s;equences whereof will be
fatal to your Fortune. Hah! Sir, what
would the Dutche&s;s &s;ay, <HI>reply'd the
Count much &s;urpriz'd,</HI> in ca&s;e I &s;hould
take your advice; hah! dear Friend?
And what will the Duke and the whole
Court &s;ay, <HI>reply'd the Chevalier,</HI> when|ever
the&s;e Gallantries are di&s;covered?

Avoid, as I told you before, an En|gagement
attended with &s;o much dan|ger.
I know not what I had be&s;t to do,
<HI>reply'd the Count in a melancholy
Tone,</HI> 'tis too late to retreat, but I will
endeavour to carry on matters with as
much Circum&s;pection as po&s;&s;ibly I can:
Adieu, I mu&s;t leave you. Oh! Count,
<HI>cry'd the Chevalier &s;haking him by
the Hand,</HI> Lewis <HI>the Great has too
many</HI> Argos'<HI>s in his Palace, 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible
to deceive him.</HI> Let us not
dwell any longer upon that Subject, <HI>&s;aid
the Count,</HI> let us go to the Opera, I
hear <HI>Mariamne</HI> is to &s;ing divers very
tender Airs to day. Yes, yes, Sir, <HI>an|&s;wered
the Chevalier laughing aloud,</HI>
that hits you exactly, you want nothing
to fortifie your Amorous Inquietudes,

<P><HI>The Duke of</HI> O&mdash;s <HI>after Play was

or ambulatory Shopkeeper, lately
come from</HI> England, <HI>who had &s;ome
very fine Ribons and Laces to &s;ell.
The Counte&s;s, who little dream'd of
<PB N="54" REF="58">
&s;uch a di&s;gui&s;e, acco&s;ted him like
what he appear'd to be, and among
other things, bought a great many
Yards of Yellow Ribbons, which</HI>
Henry, <HI>the pretended Pedlar &s;aid,
were the fine&s;t and be&s;t he had, and
that the Duke of</HI> O&mdash;s <HI>had bought
&s;ome of the &s;ame Piece.</HI> How, <HI>&s;aid
the Counte&s;s interrupting him,</HI> were
you admitted into his Pallace? Yes,
Madam, <HI>reply'd the Pedlar very con|fidently,</HI>
I was ordered to come thi|ther.
That is very much, <HI>reply'd the
Lady,</HI> but let me &s;ee &s;ome of your fine&s;t
La$es for a Head-dre&s;s. I envy the
future happine&s;s of my Laces, Ma|dam,
<HI>reply'd</HI> Henry <HI>&s;ighing,</HI> here,
are the very be&s;t. Truly, <HI>return'd Ma|dam</HI>
d' Olone, <HI>without taking notice
of his words,</HI> they are very fine, how
do you &s;ell them Friend? I &s;hall put
no Price upon them to you, Madam,
<HI>&s;aid the Pedlar with a mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate
and obliging Air,</HI> provided you &hellip;
What do&s;t thou mean by this Friend?
<HI>added the Fair Lady laughing,</HI> I
mean, my Adorable Counte&s;s, that if
<PB N="55" REF="59">
you will Love me, you &s;hall have them
for nothing. Certainly, <HI>&s;aid the Coun|te&s;s
with a &s;cornful Air,</HI> this Fellow
is Mad, and fit for <HI>Bedlam.</HI> Alas!
Madam, <HI>cry'd poor</HI> Henry, <HI>ki&s;&s;ing
her Hand mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionately,</HI> don't
treat me ill, were you &s;en&s;ible what I
&s;uffer for you, you would pity me. <HI>Ma|dam</HI>
d' Olone <HI>then ca&s;ting her Eyes
fully upon him, knew him to be the
Duke of</HI> O&mdash;s, What is your meaning,
Sir, <HI>&s;aid &s;he much &s;urpr$zed,</HI> thus to
impo&s;e upon me? You may well be call'd
<HI>Protheus,</HI> who appears in all manner
of Shapes; I think this Di&s;gui&s;e be|comes
you as well as the former. What
would you have me do, <HI>reply'd the
Duke, di&s;covering him&s;elf, and act|ing
the di&s;turbed and imaginary Lo|ver.</HI>
When one is ready to die for
Love, you &s;eem to try every thing to
plea&s;e you, and to find the way to your

&s;he with a Gallant Air,</HI> to find
the way you look'd for, by di&s;gui&s;ing
your &s;elf like a Pedlar? No, no, you
are mi&s;taken; this Dre&s;s does not very

well become you, the Path to my Heart

&s;omething that comes in a much greater

all, <HI>&s;aid the Duke,</HI> could not you ac|cept
of &s;uch a Man's Heart as I am,
and of his portable Shop together?
<HI>The Counte&s;s, who had a great
mind to the Ribbons and Laces the
Duke had &s;hew'd her, cry'd out</HI> Yes,
<HI>two or three times. So the Duke
pre&s;ented her with his whole Shop,
which &s;he freely accepted of, and
pay'd for it with the Coin of the
Court, that is, without disbur&s;ting
one Farthing; and the Duke being
much prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd with her Beauty,
thought after all, he had a good
Market of it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The next Day the Count</HI> de Guiche
<HI>having been taken up for &s;ome time
with the Thoughts upon what his
Friend had advi&s;ed him, came to
pay his Re&s;pects to the Dutche&s;s of
&mdash;whom he found by good
chance attended by one other Lady,
who withdrew as &s;oon as the Count
<PB N="57" REF="61">
came in. The Dutche&s;s no &s;ooner
ca&s;t her Eyes upon her Favourite,
but finding a con&s;iderable alteration
in his Countenance, &s;he ask'd him the
rea&s;on of it, with a great deal of
Compa&s;&s;ion and Tenderne&s;s: Where|upon
the Count, without the lea&s;t di&s;|gui&s;ing
the matter, confe&s;s'd his Fears
and the Apprehen&s;ion he was under.</HI>
What a frait Man are you Count, <HI>&s;aid
&s;he looking &s;tedfa&s;tly on him,</HI> what
occa&s;ion have you to fear, as long as you
are belov'd by me? 'Tis true, Madam,
<HI>reply'd the Count</HI> de Guiche <HI>quite
tran&s;ported,</HI> that being under the Pro|tection
of &s;o Illu&s;trious a Lady as you
are. I ought to expect all the Favours
that Fortune can be&s;tow upon me, and a
plea&s;ing Repo&s;e; but mo&s;t Divine and
Admirable Lady, pardon the fearful
Sentiments, which &s;eem &s;o contrary
to your Genero&s;ity and the Grandure of
Soul; a poor Mortal who is &s;o fortu|nate
to be belov'd by you, conceives &s;o
high an Opinion of his good Fortune,
that it &s;urpa&s;&s;es even his own knowledge,
and makes him always dread the lo&s;s of
<PB N="58" REF="62">
it; and being continually tormenied
with the&s;e Thoughts, he is always &V;n|fortunate.
And pray Count, <HI>reply'd
the Dutche&s;s in a very obliging
manner,</HI> what is to be done to &s;ettle
your good Fortune, and render you le&s;s
&V;nfortunate? I am not able to tell,
my Incomparable Lady, <HI>reply'd the
Count ki&s;&s;ing her Hand,</HI> my De&s;tiny
is at your Di&s;po&s;al, and 'tis in your
Power to &hellip;. Say no more,
Count, <HI>interrupting him with a &s;mile,</HI>
you are a Fool with all your Rhetorick,
Figures and Hyperbolical Expre&s;&s;ions.
I am very willing to own it, Madam,
<HI>&s;aid the Count in a mo&s;t re&s;pectful
manner,</HI> I am almo&s;t reduced to de&s;pair,
that I &s;hould di&s;cover you my Pa&s;&s;ion
in &s;uch rough and vulgar Language, but
was not able to pitch upon any other,
tho I have &s;tudied the Language of the
<HI>God of Love,</HI> and peru&s;ed the mo&s;t po|lite
and tender parts of it for a con&s;i|derable
time. O Count, <HI>added the
Dutche&s;s with a Charming Voice,</HI>
I am not ignorant, that true Love is not
the mo&s;t Eloquent, nor ver&s;ed in the
<PB N="59" REF="63">
Rules of Oratory, it commonly di&s;co|covers
its &s;trength and &s;incerity in di&s;|orderly
Words, and a Man who is truly
in Love, makes the odde&s;t Figure that
can be, before the Per&s;on who has en|gaged
his Heart; it &s;eems, as if his
Pa&s;&s;ion renders him fearful, ba&s;hful,
and if I may &s;ay &s;o, were not very a|greeable
at certain intervals. <HI>The
Count</HI> de Guiche, <HI>who had taken
particular notice, how nicely the
Dutche&s;s had drawn his Picture, an|&s;wered
her only by a very deep
Sigh, which &s;et her a Laughing for
&s;ome time. At la&s;t, &s;he told him in
a$mo&s;t obliging manner;</HI> Count, con|&s;ider
what is to be done, that I may
have the Satisfaction to &s;ee you every
Day; I expect a certain Young Lady
ont of <HI>England,</HI> who is to be one of
any Ladies, and who, as I am told, is
very like you; no Body knows her at
this Court, &s;o I will privately &s;end her
word &s;he mu&s;t not come as yet, becau&s;e
I am provided already at this time: In
the mean while you &s;hall di&s;gui&s;e your
&s;elf in the &s;ame Apparel intended for
<PB N="60" REF="64">
her, and &s;o pa&s;s for my Maid, and act
her Part. <HI>The Count, tho he took
no &s;mall &s;atisfaction in what he
heard the Dutche&s;s propo&s;e to him,
yet could not forbear, with all the
Symptoms of Melancholy in his Face,
to repre&s;ent the dangers and hazards
that were likely to attend &s;uch a
Di&s;gui&s;e; however he accepted the
Offer, co&s;t what it would, and &s;o
took his Leave of her for that
time.</HI></P>
<P>Some Days after the Count ha|ving
taken his Leave of the Court,
under pretence of an intended Voy|age,
put on his Womans Apparel,
which &s;uited him to a Miracle, e&s;pe|cially
when he was in a loo&s;e Dre&s;s,
wherein his Mi&s;tre&s;s much delighted
to &s;ee him, and it was taken notice
of at Court, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lady
was in extraordinary E&s;teem with
the Dutche&s;s. The Count, who un|der&s;tood
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> very well, ta&s;ted a
thou&s;and Plea&s;ures not to be expre&s;s'd
by tho&s;e who were never in Love
and beloved; having the &s;atisfacti|on
<PB N="61" REF="65">
to entertain, at all Hours, the
hand&s;ome&s;t and mo&s;t amiable of all
Women living. His Happine&s;s con|tinued
thus for about a Month, but
as even the mo&s;t perfect of all his
near Affairs draw to a Period, &s;o his
Felicity was overturn'd by an unfore|&s;een
Accident. Mrs. <HI>Degine,</HI> this was
the Name the Count had taken, be|ing
to attend at her Levy, and the
Duke happening to be there, took
particular notice of a Head-dre&s;s,
which became her very well, at la&s;t
fixing his Eyes on her, whil&s;t &s;he ca&s;t
hers down to the Ground, out of a
pretended Mode&s;ty, the Duke, who
is naturally mi&s;tru&s;tful, told his
Spou&s;e, That this young Lady was
&s;o like the Count <HI>d' Guiche,</HI> that he
believed her to be his Si&s;ter: He had
no &s;ooner &s;aid the&s;e words, but he
began to play with her, and under
that pretence put his Hand into her
Bo&s;om. The Count counterfeiting
the Maid, according to his Mi&s;tre&s;|&s;es
Command, Blu&s;h'd, not &s;o much
out of Mode&s;ty, as out of fear of
<PB N="62" REF="66">
being di&s;covered; and the Duke,
who was ignorant of the true cau&s;e
of it, pur&s;ued his Game, and told
her merrily; <HI>Don't Blu&s;h, Fair Maid,
'tis only Curio&s;ity that makes me de&s;irous
to be &s;atisfy'd in a thing I have heard
them tell me for a certain Truth,</HI> viz.
<HI>That the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Ladies are well pro|vided
with Bubbies, and I find no
&s;uch thing by you.</HI> The Dutche&s;s,
who was not well plea&s;ed with his
Court&s;hip, gave him to under&s;tand,
that &s;he could not &s;ee &s;uch like Acti|ons
in her Pre&s;ence, which made him
leave the Room. He was no &s;ooner
gone, but the Count &s;eeing him&s;elf
at liberty to talk to the Dutche&s;s,
told her with a very pen&s;ive and me|lancholy
Air; <HI>Madam, I am lo&s;t for
ever &s;hould the Duke di&s;cover me under
this Di&s;gui&s;e. I am almo&s;t di&s;tracted
with the Thoughts of it, my dear Count,</HI>
reply'd &s;he with a Sigh, <HI>I find Envy
will not &s;uffer me to enjoy the Satisfa|ction
I take in your Company, and that
even the mo&s;t innocent Plea&s;ures in the
World, mu&s;t &s;erve to di&s;turb my Re|po&s;e;
<PB N="63" REF="67">
who could have imagined, that
the Duke's Mi&s;tru&s;t and Curio&s;ity would
have reach'd &s;o far, as to think in the
lea&s;t of it? Alas! Madam,</HI> cry'd
the Count with a very pa&s;&s;ionate Air,
<HI>my Happine&s;s was too great, and too
much &s;ubject to Envy, to continue for
any long time; &s;uch Charming Plea|&s;ures
as the&s;e are &s;eldom attended with
Tranquillity. I mu&s;t confe&s;s it, Count,</HI>
reply'd the Dutche&s;s, with a Lan|gui&s;hing
Air, <HI>the highe&s;t Felicities are
never without an allay of Troubles and
Vexation: But,</HI> continued &s;he with a
Tender Air, <HI>I don't repent of what I
have done; let us carry on this Ad|venture
as far as it will bear, and leave
the re&s;t to the Favour and Conduct of
Love. Ah! mo&s;t Divine Lady,</HI> re|ply'd
the Count <HI>de Guiche</HI> trembling
and throwing him&s;elf at her Feet,
<HI>is there any Felicity like mine? No,</HI>
cry'd he, embracing them, <HI>all the pre|tended
Enjoyments of the World, are
nothing but Chimerical Notions in com|pari&s;on
to mine &hellip;..</HI> The
Count was in &s;uch a Rapture, that
he could &s;ay no more, which being
<PB N="64" REF="68">
very well ob&s;erved by the Dutche&s;s,
&s;he was moved with Compa&s;&s;ion, and
would doubtle&s;s have lent him a
helping hand, had not the Counte&s;s
<HI>de Soi&s;ons</HI> happened to come in,
which made Mrs. <HI>Degine</HI> rea&s;&s;ume
her &s;erious Countenance and to re|tire
into the Dutche&s;&s;es Clo&s;et, un|der
pretence of looking for &s;ome|thing
&s;he had left there, whil&s;t the
Dutche&s;s advanced towards the
Counte&s;s with a merry Air, &s;inging
the&s;e Words: <HI>Oh! how &s;weet are
the&s;e hidden Plea&s;ures, to two Hearts
entirely united. Are you &s;en&s;ible, as
well as my &s;elf, Madam,</HI> &s;aid the
Counte&s;s &s;miling, <HI>that Love managed
in private, is a thou&s;and times more
charming, than when it makes a noi&s;e
in the World. I can't tell that, my
Dear,</HI> reply'd the Dutche&s;s di&s;&s;em|bling
her real Sentiments, <HI>they are
Words I once heard in an Opera, which
run in my Head, becau&s;e I think them
very plea&s;ant.</HI> Their Di&s;cour&s;e run
&s;oon after upon divers other Points,
and the Vi&s;it being not very long,
<PB N="65" REF="69">
the Dutche&s;s went into the Clo&s;et,
where &s;he entertain'd her Favourite
with abundance of Freedom and Ca|re&s;&s;es,
treating him no otherwi&s;e
than if &s;he had been of her own Sex,
and telling him in a mo&s;t engaging
manner: <HI>I wonder what this Woman
wanted, to come here to di&s;turb our Di|ver&s;ions,
&s;he is one of tho&s;e that mu&s;t be
every where, where her Company is not
much de&s;ired.</HI> The Count who &s;aw
him&s;elf care&s;s'd with &s;uch an Exce&s;s
of Tenderne&s;s, return'd no An&s;wer,
dreading the Con&s;equence, and that
his Satisfaction would be of no lon|ger
Continuance; and the Dutche&s;s
gue&s;&s;ing at the cau&s;e of his Silence,
told him with a Smile; <HI>How, fair</HI>
Minerva, <HI>are you &s;o bu&s;ie as not to
&s;peak one word? Would it plea&s;e Hea|vens,
Madam,</HI> cry'd the Count quite
tran&s;ported, <HI>I was Ma&s;ter of the Ta|lent
belonging to that Godde&s;s, I would
transform my &s;elf in what &s;hape I
thought mo&s;t favourable to my Love, and
con&s;equently would make my &s;elf the
mo&s;t happy Mortal on Earth. Could
<PB N="66" REF="70">
you, Count,</HI> reply'd the Dutche&s;s,
<HI>borrow that Cloud wherein this Daugh|ter
of</HI> Jupiter <HI>&s;aved</HI> Uly&s;&s;es <HI>from the
Per&s;ecutions of a Nymph who kept him
&s;hut up in her Grotto for fear of lo&s;ing
him, you would have opportunity enough
to deceive abundance of mi&s;tru&s;tful Per|&s;ons,
and e&s;pecially the Duke. Madam,</HI>
&s;aid the Count not without &s;ome
heat, <HI>when he might &s;earch at Plea|&s;ure,
he would gra&s;p at a Shadow only.
But after all, my Dear,</HI> reply'd the
Dutche&s;s Laughing aloud, <HI>I would
not have you dwell always in a Cloud,
Love is for more &s;ub&s;tantial things.
That is true, adorable Lady,</HI> reply'd
the Count with a pa&s;&s;ionate Air, <HI>but
had I the Power of taking what &s;hape I
plea&s;e, I would often transform my &s;elf
into a</HI> Golden Rain, <HI>or &s;ome &s;uch
like thing. Alas!</HI> added the Dutche&s;s
with a Sigh, <HI>why don't we live in that
happy Age, when &hellip;.</HI> The
Duke coming in, but overhearing
only the&s;e la&s;t words, without being
able to gue&s;s at the re&s;t of what had
been talk'd betwixt them, continued
<PB N="67" REF="71">
their Di&s;cour&s;e with a malicious Air;
<HI>when People liv'd in Tranquility and
without Inquietudes. You are in the
right of it, Sir,</HI> reply'd the Dutche&s;s,
ari&s;ing from her Seat, and ordering
Mrs, <HI>Degine,</HI> with a very &s;erious Air,
to take care to have &s;omething alter|ed
in her <HI>Toilet.</HI></P>
<P>Dinner being over, the Duke was
very unea&s;ie to know what was be|come
of the Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI> went
to <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> where he con&s;ulted with
the King and &s;ome great Lords of the
Court about it, but could learn no|thing
that was &s;atisfactory among
them. For, tho this Prince was o|verjoy'd
at his Ab&s;ence, neverthele&s;s
he could not forbear making his
Enquiry after him, moved by a cer|tain
Curio&s;ity, which is natural to
him. But not being able to hear any
certain Account of him, and meeting
with the Mar&s;hal <HI>de Grammont,</HI> ju&s;t as
he was coming out of his Maje&s;ties
Clo&s;et, he ask'd him concerning his
Son, who an&s;wer'd him in a melan|choly
Tone, That his Son had con|ceal'd
<PB N="68" REF="72">
his Voyage from him, &s;o that
he did not know what Cour&s;e he
had taken. <HI>'Tis likely,</HI> reply'd the
Duke &s;miling, <HI>this Gallant Cavalier
thought it bi&s;t to be beforehand with the
Court, who de&s;igned to &s;end him to
&hellip;.</HI> The Mar&s;hal, who very
well under&s;tood the Duke's meaning,
thought fit to di&s;&s;emble the matter,
<HI>and therefore you are,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>doubtle&s;s
better acquainted with the My&s;tery than
my &s;elf: I am ignorant in mo&s;t of my
Sons Affairs, and willing, as far as in
me lies, not to be troubled with them.
You are in the right of it,</HI> reply'd the
Duke with a &s;mile, <HI>a Per&s;on of the
Count</HI> de Guiche'<HI>s Character, often
carries Matters beyond what he thinks
of, nay, even beyond what he ought to
do. What can I do in &s;uch a ca&s;e,</HI>
&s;ays the Mar&s;hal much vex'd, <HI>I hope
you will have &s;o much Goodne&s;s, Sir,
as to excu&s;e his Faults, and that want
of Re&s;pect he has been guilty of towards
your Per&s;on. Yes, Mar&s;hal,</HI> reply'd
the Duke as he was going away, <HI>I
will excu&s;e and pardon every thing for
<PB N="69" REF="73">
your &s;ake; but if he is forgetful of
what he owes me, he mu&s;t not expect
either to make his Fortune through my
Means, or hope for any other Favours
from me.</HI> The Mar&s;hal <HI>de Grammont</HI>
had no &s;ooner parted from the Duke
but he went to one whom he knew
to be his Sons Confident, and rela|ted
to him what had pa&s;s'd betwixt
the Duke and him, and entreating
him to let him know where he was,
becau&s;e he intended to write to him
concerning &s;ome Matters of the la&s;t
Con&s;equence: But the Marque&s;s of
&hellip;. who was acquainted with
every &s;tep the Count <HI>de Guiche</HI> made
in all his Affairs, would notwith|&s;tanding
all the Earne&s;t Intreaties of
the Mar&s;hal, not tell him one word of
his Concerns, but &s;o &s;oon as he was
gone, took care to write the follow|ing
Lines to the Count his Friend.</P>

Lady of the whole World, that
you little think of tho&s;e Misfor|tunes
which mu&s;t inevitably befal
you, unle&s;s you take immediate
care of, and reflect &s;eriou&s;ly on your
pre&s;ent Condition; having Sworn
an inviolable and con&s;tant Friend|&s;hip
to you, 'tis that that has obli|ged
me to put Pen to Paper, to
<PB N="71" REF="75">
to forewarn you of the danger,
and to tell you, that I pity any
Body that is thus by the Snares of
Love drawn to the very Brink of
&s;o high a Precipice: But, perhaps
you will tell me, this Advice is di|rectly
oppo&s;ite to your Satisfaction,
and that I being Blind my &s;elf,
pretend to Lead another Blind Man,
and that unle&s;s Fortune thinks fit
to favour us, we &s;hall be, both in
the &s;ame degree: I am very &s;en&s;ible
what you are able to tell me on
that Head, but I be&s;eech you, be|fore
you do it to con&s;ider what a
va&s;t difference there is betwixt the
Dutche&s;s of &hellip;. and the
Counte&s;s of &hellip;. So con|cluding
my Letter, I remain,&endq;</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="70" REF="76">
<HI>The Count, who happened to be
alone when this Letter was delivered
to him, was ready to die for Vexati|on,
when he perceived his &s;ini&s;ter
De&s;tiny to croud upon him on all
&s;ides:</HI> Alas! <HI>&s;aid he to him&s;elf in
a mo&s;t doleful Po&s;ture;</HI> mu&s;t I for
ever abandon the Charms and Enjoy|ments
of my Life? No, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible,
<HI>continued he,</HI> unle&s;s it be with the
Lo&s;s of my Life, which would be very
indifferent to me without the enjoyment
of the &s;ame Felicity: But alas! I talk
at random, and was not born for the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch precious Things; I
mu&s;t take leave of my Charming Mi|&s;tre&s;s,
who has at all times given me
&s;uch &s;ignal Proofs of her Goodne&s;s, that
I find my &s;elf too weak by far to put in
execution &s;o weak a Re&s;olution, and &s;o
oppo&s;ite to my Repo&s;e. O! Love, who
ha&s;t kindled &s;o bright a Flame, which
has almo&s;t con&s;umed me, pray afford
me &s;trength to &s;upport. But I lo&s;e all
my Sen&s;es in the very Idea of this fatal
Parting; nothing is able to afford me
<PB N="73" REF="77">
any Con&s;olation for &s;o great a Lo&s;s;
But what is to be done? I had better
part with this Incomparable Lady for
&s;ome time, than be for ever debarr'd
from &s;eeing her. <HI>The Count was &s;till
bu&s;ied in talking thus, when the
Dutche&s;s of&mdash;who had
been abroad a vi&s;iting with the
Counte&s;s of</HI> Soi&s;ons, <HI>and &s;ome La|dies,
entered the Room alone, and
finding the Count quite buried in his
Complaints, &s;he drew nearer, and
told him with a Smile,</HI> What is the
matter, dear Mrs <HI>Degine?</HI> You &s;eem
to be quite dejected, and do nothing
but &s;igh. O Heavens! Madam, can
you ask what is the matter, after that
fatal Order I am forced to obey, to be
&s;eparated from you, mo&s;t Divine Lady,
is not that enough to make me die a
thou&s;and Deaths? Nay, 'tis certain,
this fatal &s;troak will co&s;t me my Li$e.
<HI>The Count could not pronounce
the&s;e words without &s;hedding &s;ome
Tears, which being very precious to
the Dutche&s;s, &s;he ask'd him in a mo&s;t
tender manner, Whether he had
<PB N="74" REF="78">
heard any other ill Tidings, and what
made him give way thus to his Pa&s;|&s;ion.
The Count was not in a con|dition
to &s;ay one word, his Sobs and
Sighs had &s;top'd the free Cour&s;e of
his Voice; which the Dutche&s;s per|ceiving,
told him with a very pa&s;&s;i|onate
Air;</HI> What means this Silence,
my dear Count? Alas! I am as much
afflicted as your &s;elf when I think of
our cruel &s;eparation; but take Comfort,
this &s;hall not be, till there is no further
Remedy again&s;t it. Madam, <HI>reply'd
he with a melancholy Air,</HI> you know
that great Afflictions are &s;peechle&s;s,
whereas indifferent ones make a great
noi&s;e; the Duke leaves no Stone un|turn'd
to know what is become of me:
A certain Friend of mine has given me
notice of it, and if I &s;hould be found
out, I am undone for ever: And &s;o
am I Count, <HI>reply'd the Dutche&s;s full
of Sadne&s;s,</HI> but can the Duke carry his
Mi&s;tru&s;t &s;o far, as to imagine that you
are here under the Di&s;gui&s;e of a Young
Lady? Notbing more certain, Madam,
<HI>&s;aid the Count</HI> de Guiche, <HI>&s;hewing
<PB N="75" REF="79">
her the Letter that was &s;ent him:</HI>
This is what the mo&s;t faithful of all
my Friends writes to me. And who
is this Friend, Count? <HI>reply'd the
Dutche&s;s looking on him &s;tedfa&s;tly,
and having peru&s;ed the Letter,</HI> Don't
di&s;&s;emble with me, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> I dare en|gage
it is your &s;incere Confident <HI>De|ward?</HI>
No, Madam, 'tis the Mar|qui&s;s
of &hellip;. who loves me as
dear as his own Brother, and who would
run di&s;tracted, &s;hould any misfortune
befal me. Oh! I know him, my Dear,
<HI>an&s;wered &s;he,</HI> he is a Man of Honour,
and is Ma&s;ter of a va&s;t &s;hare of Sen&s;e;
we mu&s;t then be forced to follow his
Advice, to part, which can't be done
without an infinite deal of trouble and
pain on either &s;ide; but we mu&s;t give
way to nece&s;&s;ity, without any further
Con&s;ideration; that &s;o we may hope to
enjoy the Satisfaction of &s;eeing one ano|ther
again. <HI>At la&s;t it was agreed,
that Mrs.</HI> Degine <HI>&s;hould go back into</HI>
England, <HI>under pretence of want of
Health, and that the Air of</HI> France
<HI>was not agreeable to her Con&s;tituti|on;
<PB N="76" REF="80">
and that afterwards the Count
&s;hould appear again at Court, pre|tending
he had taken a Tour to &s;ome
of the mo&s;t remote Provinces. This
was done accordingly &s;ome Weeks
after, &s;carce any Body &s;u&s;pecting the
matter, except very few who got
&s;cent of all the chief Circum&s;tances
relating to this Affair.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>O&mdash;s</HI> being now
&s;omewhat ea&s;ed of his Jealou&s;ie,
thought of nothing el&s;e but how to
divert him&s;elf, went two or three
Days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to the Play: The
fourth Day, when the whole Court
was there pre&s;ent, he got upon the
Stage, and told the Comedians, that
he would be one of the Actors that
Day, which they ea&s;ily con&s;ented to;
they happened in this Play to di|vert
the Company with an Entry
compo&s;ed of di&s;gui&s;ed Lovers;
wherein the Duke of <HI>O&mdash;s</HI> repre|&s;ented
the Part of a di&s;gui&s;ed Shep|herde&s;s,
courted by a good number
of Rural Cupids, whil&s;t her Shepherd
was in &s;earch after her in a &s;olitary
<PB N="77" REF="81">
Wood: The Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI> who was
at the Play-hou&s;e, Blu&s;h'd &s;everal times
whil&s;t they were a dancing, fearing
le&s;t &s;ome Body or other had found
out, what a Part he had acted of late
at Court. The Play being done,
the Duke of <HI>O&mdash;s,</HI> who was very
de&s;irous to hear the Approbation of
the Court concerning the Rural De|portment
of the Sphepherde&s;s, began
the Di&s;cour&s;e, and ask'd every one
his Opinion. <HI>Truly,</HI> &s;aid the King
Laughing, <HI>the Shepherde&s;s &s;eem'd to
me agreeable enough, tho all Ornaments
they had were nothing but Flowers; but
after all, I liked be&s;t of all her Coun|try
like ways when her Lover came to
her, and &s;he frankly and &s;incerely told
him, &s;he had loved him before &s;he had
known him, relying upon the account
&s;he had received from one of her Compa|nions,
of his &s;ingular Merits, before all
the other Shepherds of the Village. And
for my part,</HI> &s;aid the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;coldly,
<HI>I was much plea&s;ed
with the Shepherds mo&s;t tender Decla|ration
to his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and with his
<PB N="78" REF="82">
Country like Expre&s;&s;ions; he call'd the
Meadows and Woods a thou&s;and times
to be Witne&s;&s;es of his Oaths, and with
the&s;e Savage Lovers, who writ their
Names on the Barks of Trees, and be&s;t
of all with that ugly Satyr, who lay
conceal'd in a hollow Tree to ob&s;erve
their Court&s;hip; I had not ea&s;ily laugh'd
&s;o much as I did, when I &s;aw this Sa|tyr
bur&s;t out into mo&s;t dreadful Cries,
&s;o &s;oon as he ob&s;erved</HI> Damon <HI>to take
his Mi&s;tre&s;s by the Hand, and to ki&s;s
it mo&s;t tenderly. That old jealous
horned Bea&s;t,</HI> reply'd the Duke &s;mi|ling,
<HI>could not be an Eye Witne&s;s of
the&s;e innocent Plea&s;ures, without being
envious at them There are many others,</HI>
continued the Dutche&s;s Laughing, <HI>of
the &s;ame Opinion, tho they are no Sa|tyrs,
unle&s;s it be by their Heads: To
put a mark upon them, they ought to
bear the Weapons of that Creature.
Alas!</HI> reply'd the King with a mali|cious
Smile, <HI>there are enough of tho&s;e
that wear them without knowing it.</HI>
The Conver&s;ation had not ended
here, but that Supper was &s;erved up,
<PB N="79" REF="83">
after which they went to Play till
pretty late in the Night.</P>
<P>The Dutche&s;s of&mdash;who
was fal'n into a very deep Melancho|ly
ever &s;ince the Count de <HI>Guiche</HI>
had left off his Female Apparel, went
home pretty early, being &s;carce able
to di&s;pen&s;e with any Merry Compa|ny.
The Count, on his &s;ide, was
not in a better condition; for after
having ta&s;ted the Charms and Ra|vi&s;hments
of Love, he call'd to his
Remembrance, without intermi&s;&s;ion,
the Plea&s;ures he had lo&s;t by his Ab|&s;ence,
and that nothing in the World
was comparable to the Pre&s;ence of
his incomparable Dutche&s;s: The&s;e
langui&s;hing and doleful Reflections
reduced him to &s;o low a &s;tate, that
he wax'd Ill, and was almo&s;t in&s;up|portable
in Company: His ordinary
place of Retirement was in the Wood
of <HI>Vincennes,</HI> where he &s;pent the
greate&s;t part of his time in rumina|ting
upon his Misfortune. One Day
when the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;was
taking the Air, in the Company of
<PB N="80" REF="84">
the Counte&s;s of <HI>Soi&s;ons</HI> near the &s;aid
Wood, they e&s;py'd at a di&s;tance a
certain Per&s;on well attired, lying up|on
the Gra&s;s near a &s;mall Brook, ut|tering
mo&s;t dreadful Complaints,
Women being naturally inclin'd to
Curio&s;ity, they ordered the Coach|man
to drive that way, and the
Counte&s;s &s;oon knowing him to be
the Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI> cry'd out aloud
&s;o as to frighten the Dutche&s;s of
&mdash;<HI>Oh! What is the matter with
you, Counte&s;s,</HI> &s;aid the Dutche&s;s, <HI>are
you frightned at a Gentleman. O!
Madam,</HI> reply'd my Lady <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons,</HI>
&s;omewhat &s;urpriz'd, <HI>'tis the Count</HI> de
Guiche, <HI>whom we heard to utter tho&s;e
Sighs and Complaints. Alas! my dear,</HI>
an&s;wered the Dutche&s;s with &s;ome
Emotion, <HI>what fatal Accident has be|faln
him? Come let us go near, I be|&s;eech
you.</HI> The Ladies alighting out
of the Coach, went to the place
where they &s;aw this afflicted Lover,
who being amazed at the &s;ight of
the Object of his Vows, heard her
&s;ay to him &s;miling; <HI>What do you
<PB N="81" REF="85">
Count, your Thoughts carry you to very
remote places.</HI> The Gentleman, who
very well under&s;tood the Dutche&s;&s;es
meaning, aro&s;e and paid his Re|&s;pects
to her, in the mo&s;t langui&s;h|ing
manner in the World: <HI>My In|quietudes,</HI>
&s;aid he, <HI>Madam, draw me
hither in &s;pite of my &s;elf, and triumph
over my weakne&s;s. I find Count,</HI> re|ply'd
the Dutche&s;s Laughing, <HI>you
are fal'n in Love with &s;ome Nymph or
other of this Wood, who doubtle&s;s has
given you a tender A&s;&s;ignation in this
delightful place. Alas! Madam,</HI> &s;aid
the Count, ca&s;ting a tender Look at
her, and fetching &s;everal deep Sighs,
<HI>Did you but know how indifferent all
A&s;&s;ignations are to me, ever &s;ince&hellip;
I under&s;tand your meaning, Sir,</HI> &s;aid
the Dutche&s;s interrupting him, for
fear lea&s;t he &s;hould &s;ay more than
he ought to do before the Counte&s;s,
who was very well ver&s;ed in the
Game of Love, <HI>come into our Coach to
divert your Splenatick Thoughts; the
Air of this Wood is accounted very
whol&s;ome for Langui&s;hing Lovers, &s;uch
<PB N="82" REF="86">
as you are at this time.</HI> The Count
being ready to obey, took &s;everal
Turns with them in the Coach, and
the next day paid a Vi&s;it to the
Dutche&s;s at her Palace; &s;he being
then engaged in Company, the Count
retired into one of the mo&s;t remote
Corners of the Room, to amu&s;e him|&s;elf
in compo&s;ing &s;ome Ver&s;es, till
the Company were gone. Every mo|ment
&s;eem'd no le&s;s than a Year to
him, but at la&s;t &s;eeing his admired
Lady alone, he ha&s;tned to meet her,
and &s;he conducted him into her Clo|&s;et,
where they were together for
two hours, and as 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed, did
not &s;pend all their time in trifling
Di&s;cour&s;es. The Duke then hap|pening
to come to the Clo&s;et Door,
and his Spou&s;e not knowing what to
do at &s;o unexpected an Exigency of
Affairs, put her Lover into a Ward|robe,
and putting the Key into her
Pocket, went to open the Door to
the Duke, who with a merry Coun|tenance
told her, <HI>Madam, you are in|vited
to a mo&s;t magnificent Fea&s;$, the
<PB N="83" REF="87">
King is to give this Evening, and are
to be the Queen of the Ball, but you
mu&s;t come along with me immediately,
becau&s;e the whole Company &s;tays for your
coming. Sir, why would not you let
me know of it, for now,</HI> reply'd the
Dutche&s;s with much indifferency, <HI>I
did not expect no &s;uch thing. Nor I
neither, Madam,</HI> continued the Duke,
<HI>but this Surprize is &s;o agreeable in it
&s;elf, that you can't well be di&s;plea&s;ed
with it, con&s;idering you love Dancing,
and good Dancers &s;o dearly; and you
will be &s;ure to meet there with all the
Gallants of the Court, e&s;pecially the
Duke of &hellip;. who, in your
Opinion, is capable of charming the
mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible Heart in the World. You
have an excellent Memory, Sir,</HI> reply'd
the Dutche&s;s with &s;ome &s;corn, <HI>to re|member
&s;till what I &s;aid the other Day,
certainly you have thought more of him
&s;ince, than I. Come, let us not di&s;&s;em|ble
with one another,</HI> return'd the
Duke, <HI>you have at lea&s;t as much kind|ne&s;s
for him, as for the Count</HI> de &hellip;.
<HI>who is your Bo&s;om Favourite: But
<PB N="84" REF="88">
pray what is become of him, methinks I
&s;ee him not &s;o often as I u&s;ed to do.
You know more of him, Sir,</HI> &s;aid &s;he
Blu&s;hing, <HI>than any body el&s;e, and I
wonder your Curio&s;ity &s;hould not lead
you to learn every thing concerning him,
you want to know. Well, let us call
another Cau&s;e, &s;ince this vexes you,</HI> re|ply'd
the Duke, <HI>and make ha&s;te to
the Ball. Pray go you before,</HI> &s;aid the
Dutche&s;s coldly, <HI>I have &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s
to do that admits of no delay, before I
go.</HI> There needed no more to rai&s;e
the Duke's Curio&s;ity, who is always
ready to lay hold even of the mo&s;t
in&s;ignificant occa&s;ions; &s;o that the
poor Lady &s;eeing not the lea&s;t Pro|bability
of ridding her hands of him,
was fixed to go forward &s;orely a|gain&s;t
her Will, and leave the Count
&s;hut up in the Wardrobe. The
Dutche&s;s, who was a mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate
Lover of Dancing, and all the other
Delights of our Sen&s;es, &s;eeing her
&s;elf adored by all the Princes and
great Lords there pre&s;ent, thought
no more on her poor Count, who
<PB N="85" REF="89">
found his Quarters &s;o unea&s;ie, that
he had &s;everal times a mind to call
out for help; had not his fear of be|ing
di&s;covered and lo&s;ing his adored
Beauty, withheld, and, as it were, &s;ti|fled
his Voice. <HI>&V;nto what innume|rable
Troubles does not my Love expo&s;e
me,</HI> &s;aid he to him&s;elf, whil&s;t &s;hut up
in the Cage, <HI>every Day furni&s;hes me
fre&s;h Matter of Vexation; but,</HI> added
he, <HI>I &s;ometimes al&s;o reap the Fruits of
my Pains and Trouble; and &s;ince my
adorable Mi&s;tre&s;s is not come to me, I
ought to conquer my Impatience, and
expect with con&s;tancy my Delivery;
this will be look'd upon as a Sacrifice
of Sufferings I am again to offer to her
Charms.</HI> Thus the Count pa&s;s'd a|way
his tire&s;ome Hours, each of
which &s;eem'd an Age to him: About
Day Break, the Dutche&s;s, who had
been very Merry all that while, re|membring
her Pri&s;oner. <HI>Alas!</HI> cry'd
&s;he in a Fright, <HI>what have I done?</HI>
The King and Prince <HI>de Conde,</HI> who
&s;ate next to her, &s;urprized to &s;ee her
thus change on a &s;udden, our Mo|narch
<PB N="86" REF="90">
whi&s;pering her, ask'd, What
could be the cau&s;e of &s;o unexpected
an Emotion; <HI>I will tell you, Sir,</HI> re|ply'd
&s;he with a melancholy Air;
<HI>this is the remaining Idea of a Fright,
which happened to me &s;ome time ago,
the remembrance whereof always troubles
me. And Madam,</HI> an&s;wered the King
pa&s;&s;ionately, <HI>may not one know what
it is; perhaps there may be a way found
to cure you of it? No, Sir,</HI> reply'd
the Dutche&s;s, <HI>pray don't urge me any
further, it will be over as &s;oon as I re|turn
to the</HI> Palace Royal. His Ma|je&s;ty,
who at all times is highly
Complai&s;ant to the Fair Sex, &s;aid no
more; and &s;he no &s;ooner &s;aw the
King gone another way, but went a|way
<HI>incognito,</HI> in order to deliver
the Count from his Impri&s;onment.
After having made a thou&s;and Excu|&s;es
for her forgetfulne&s;s, &s;he de&s;ired
him, with a mo&s;t charming and ten|der
Air, to depart for fear of &s;uch
another &s;ini&s;ter Accident, which he
&s;aw him&s;elf obliged to do, tho his
Love pleaded never &s;o &s;trong again&s;t
<PB N="87" REF="91">
it. The Duke happening to come
within a quarter of an hour into
the Dutche&s;&s;es Apartment, did feel
&s;omething under his Feet, ju&s;t at the
very Door, which being taken up,
he found it to be the Count's Pocket
Book he had let drop for ha&s;te, as he
was going away, and contain'd, a|mong
other things, the before men|tioned
Ver&s;es, and &s;ome of his pa&s;&s;i|nate
Letters he had &s;hewn to the
Dutche&s;s. The Duke, who had been
too much acquainted with the Count
not to know his Hand Writing, was
going to the Candle to peru&s;e them,
but the Dutche&s;s who ob&s;erved his
Motions, in a &s;eeming compo&s;ed
Air, came and &s;natch'd them from
behind out of his Hands. <HI>Let me
alone, Madam,</HI> &s;aid the Duke &s;ome|what
angry, <HI>I have here the Secrets of
the Count</HI> de Guiche, <HI>I &s;uppo&s;e 'tis not
very long ago &s;ince he was here. 'Tis
above a Month ago,</HI> &s;aid the Dutch|e&s;s
much di&s;turbed, <HI>&s;ince I &s;poke a
word to him; and it was I who took
the Table Book from him, becau&s;e he
<PB N="88" REF="92">
told me that contain'd the exact Por|traiture
of his Mi&s;tre&s;s. Let us &s;ee it
then,</HI> &s;aid the Duke Laughing <HI>perhaps
it is the Prince&s;s of &hellip;..
who in&s;piries into him the&s;e Amorous
Fits, and who has turn'd his Brains.
Not long ago I &s;aw him in</HI> Tuillery,
<HI>talk to him&s;elf in a &s;olitary place, re|mote
from the Company, like a</HI> Man|hater.
<HI>You know much more of him
than I do, Sir,</HI> reply'd the Dutche&s;s
with a &s;eeming Indifference, <HI>he ne|ver
communicated his Secrets to me;
you know that Men in general make
&s;uch My&s;teries of their Amorous In|trigues,
that one can't intermeddle in
tho&s;e Affairs, without offending them.
And, Madam,</HI> &s;aid the Duke, <HI>are not
the Ladies guilty of the &s;ame fault?
If di&s;&s;embling in this kind be a Crime,
certainly it belongs a thou&s;and times
more to your Sex than ours; you make
My&s;teries of every thing, witne&s;s your
pre&s;ent Deportment, for you will nei|ther
let me &s;ee the Count's Pocket Book,
nor make me a Confident of his Incli|nations.
I beg your pardon, Sir,</HI> re|ply'd
<PB N="89" REF="93">
the Dutche&s;s with a flattering
Air, <HI>I have promi&s;ed him a thou&s;and
times upon my Honour, not to reveal his
Secrets, and &s;ince you have &s;o little
re&s;pect for him, what good will it do
you? I &s;hould be very glad to divert
my &s;elf at his Book,</HI> reply'd the Duke,
<HI>with my Friends, who would be very
well plea&s;ed with &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;ion.</HI>
The Dutche&s;s, who was very unea|&s;ie
at the Pocket Book, wherein &s;he
was not a little concern'd, lock'd
them up very &s;ecure, and the Duke
before &s;he could get into Bed, came
again to teaze her about it for a con|&s;iderable
time, but in vain, &s;o he left
her Chamber in Di&s;content, and
continued in &s;o ill a Humour for ma|ny
Days after, that &s;carce any Body
dur&s;t &s;peak to him.</P>
<P>The Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI> in the mean
while, went to &s;earch for his Pocket
Book in every Place, and was ready to
run di&s;tracted when he con&s;idered
that he might perhaps have dropt it
in the <HI>Palace Royal,</HI> and that &s;ome
Body or other of the Duke's Family
<PB N="90" REF="94">
might have taken it up. To be &s;a|tisfy'd
in the matter, he went the
next Day in a very &s;erious Po&s;ture
to vi&s;it the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;,
who told him with a malicious Air,
<HI>Alas! Count, we are undone, you have
dropt your Table Book, and the Duke
of&mdash;has found it, con&s;ider into
what Troubles you have plunged me.</HI>
The Count, at this dreadful News,
was ready to drop down at her Feet,
for fear the whole Intrigue &s;hould be
unravell'd; <HI>Take Courage, my Dear,</HI>
&s;aid the Dutche&s;s &s;eeing him thus
dejected; <HI>&s;uch Timorous Lovers as you
&s;tand frequently in need of a Comforter.
'Tis certain, Madam,</HI> reply'd he ki&s;|&s;ing
her Hand, <HI>tho&s;e charming Words
coming from your fair Mouth, are e|nough
to revive me from the Dead,
without which my Misfortunes has long
ago carry'd your &V;nfortunate Slave to
the Grave. How, Count,</HI> return'd the
Lady, <HI>and you think your &s;elf Vnfor|tunate,
after what I have done for you.
Alas! I am afraid you are &V;&V;ngrateful
and little de&s;erving of my Favours and
<PB N="91" REF="95">
Care. Madam,</HI> an&s;wered the Count
<HI>de Guiche</HI> in a mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Po|&s;ture,
<HI>you did not very well apprehend
my meaning; I think my &s;elf &V;nfor|tunate
in re&s;pect of my Birth, being
&s;o much inferiour to yours, but in re|&s;pect
of your Goodne&s;s toward me, all
the World is not able to furni&s;h me
with words &s;uitable to the Acknowledg|ment
I owe you, and the Satisfaction I
&s;eek within me. This is a very fair
Confe&s;&s;ion, Count,</HI> &s;aid the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;with
a &s;mile, <HI>let us talk no
more of our Vexations and Troubles.</HI>
The Count &s;pent the whole Day and
half the Night with her, in &s;uch
Diver&s;ions as be&s;t &s;uited her pre&s;ent
Inclinations; but great was their
Surprize, when about two a Clock
in the Morning, the Gentleman who
had made the be&s;t of his time in the
ab&s;ence of the Duke of&mdash;heard
him coming towards the
Room where they were, and the
Lady who heard his Tongue, &s;aid
to the Count, who was in Bed with
her; <HI>Good Heavens, my dear Count,
<PB N="92" REF="96">
we are undone, I hear the Duke's Voice,
what mu&s;t we do to hide our &s;elves from
his Jealous Eyes?</HI> The Count trem|bling
from Head to Foot without
being able to return one word in
An&s;wer to his Godde&s;s, got out of
her Arms under the Bed in his Shirt
only; and the Duke of&mdash;be|ing
re&s;olved not to go into his own
Bedchamber, before he had &s;een his
Lady in hers, went thither accord|ingly
without a Candle, and very
&s;oftly, for fear of making a noi&s;e and
di&s;turbing her, it being a bright
Moon light Night; finding her awake,
he &s;eated him&s;elf upon her Bed&s;ide,
where he entertain'd her with divers
trifling Matters, whil&s;t the poor La|dy
was under the greate&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s
in the World for her Lover, who
lay all this while upon the Boards to
&s;ave him&s;elf. She did all &s;he could
to get rid of him, but finding all her
Endeavours in vain, &s;he pretended
to be a&s;leep, de&s;iring him, at the
&s;ame time to let her re&s;t a little, be|cau&s;e
&s;he had not &s;lept all that Night,
<PB N="93" REF="97">
being very much troubled at his long
&s;tay; <HI>but now,</HI> added &s;he, <HI>I have
&s;een you here, pray let me take a little
re&s;t, Not &s;o, Madam,</HI> reply'd the
Duke of&mdash;<HI>I don't intend to lie
alone this Night, and to convince you
of it, I am just now coming into Bed
to you. Oh! I did believe as much,
Sir.</HI> reply'd the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;vex'd
to the Heart; <HI>We Marry'd Wo|men
now adays have but a &s;lender In|fluence
upon our Husbands. And tru|ly,
Madam,</HI> return'd he &s;miling, <HI>we
Husbands, have much le&s;s upon our
Wives. How! for a Woman to refu&s;e
to her Husband the Lawful Priviledges
of Marriage. To tell you the Truth,
nothing can be more Vexatious and
Afflicting to a Husband, than to &s;ee
him&s;elf treated in &s;uch a manner.</HI>
The Dutche&s;s &s;eeing it was but in
vain to make more words; and that
he was re&s;olved to come into Bed
to her, &s;ubmitted with Patience,
and the poor Count was forced to
creep clo&s;e in his Quarters, under|neath
till Day light. You may
<PB N="94" REF="98">
gue&s;s at his Vexation, e&s;pecially
when he perceived his Mi&s;tre&s;s to
receive the Care&s;&s;es of a Man in the
World he hated mo&s;t. As good For|tune
would have it, the Duke of
&hellip; having a mind to ri&s;e ear|ly
in the Morning, and his Gentle|man
happening to light upon the
Count <HI>de Guiche</HI>'s Coat he had left
near the Bed&s;ide, was going to pre|&s;ent
it to him, had not one of the
Dutche&s;s of &hellip; Lady's who was
acquainted with the whole Intrigue,
&s;natch'd it out of his Hands, and
with much dexterity, he put the
Duke's Cloaths into his Hands, tel|ling
him, <HI>the Duke would wear a
Blue Coat that Day;</HI> and the Young
Gentleman being innocent in the
Matter, took the Cloaths and dre&s;s'd
his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P><HI>He was no &s;ooner gone, but the
poor Count came creeping out from
under the Bed, trembling with cold
from Head to Foot, as if he had an
Ague; but care was taken to put
&s;ome fre&s;h heat into him, which
<PB N="95" REF="99">
done, they laugh'd heartily at the
dexterity of</HI> Tinote, <HI>and the Game
&s;he had play'd with the Duke of
&hellip; Gentleman.</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s,
Madam, &s;aid the Count as he &s;at, <HI>af|ter
being &s;omewhat recovered,</HI> that
the name of a Hear&s;e, which I had
given to this Young Lady, &s;uits exact|ly
with her Genius, Wit, and Activity,
without which we had been all undone,
without any Reprieve. You &s;ee, Count,
<HI>reply'd the Lady &s;miling,</HI> That Love
has always &s;ome hidden Re&s;erve or
other, to &s;ave us Lovers; and that we
mu&s;t hope the &s;ame God will be our
Protector for the future: But I can ne|ver
be at Ea&s;e, till I put a Trick up|on
this Jealous Pated Duke. What
Trick do you intend to play him, Ma|dam,
<HI>&s;aid the Count, looking &s;tead|fa&s;t
upon her,</HI> It will not be long be|fore
you &s;hall &s;ee it, be at re&s;t, your Cu|rio&s;ity
&s;hall be &s;atisfy'd at our next
Meeting.</P>
<P><HI>'Twas not long after, that the
Count</HI> de Guiche <HI>took his leave of
the Dutche&s;s of &hellip; with a
<PB N="96" REF="100">
very melancholy Countenance, which
being &s;oon taken notice of by her,
&s;he told him with a Charming and
Engaging Air,</HI> whence proceeds this
langui&s;hing, dear Count, in your Eyes;
Take care you don't fall Sick, and pray
never dye any other Death but that of
Love, if you Love me. I will do all
that in me lies, Madam, <HI>reply'd the
Count very pa&s;&s;ionately,</HI> to pre&s;erve
my Life, &s;ince it is &s;o happy as to be
Dear and Precious to you. Go, go,
that's enough, Count, <HI>&s;aid the Dut|che&s;s,</HI>
Remember, and prepare your
&s;elf for another Adventure, where Love
&s;hall have its full Lu&s;tre of Plea&s;ures,
and where you may &hellip; without any
Intermi&s;&s;ion. Very well, Madam, <HI>&s;aid
the Count</HI> de Guiche <HI>&s;miling,</HI> I will
endeavour to improve the next Time
and Opportunity to the utmo&s;t, and
to give you the m$&s;t convincing proofs
in the World, of my readine&s;s to &s;erve
you.</P>
<P><HI>No &s;ooner had the Count left
his Fair Mi&s;tre&s;s, but he went to pay
a Vi&s;it to the Marquis of &hellip; his
<PB N="97" REF="101">
faithful Confident, unto whom he
gave a &s;incere Relation of all that
had happened. His Friend quite
&s;urpriz'd at the oddne&s;s of the Ad|venture,</HI>
I can't but tell you, Dear
Friend, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> that you run incre|dible
hazards, and that perhaps you
will pay at a very dear Rate for the&s;e
&s;ecret Plea&s;ures and Enjoyments. How
to venture in &s;uch a manner your &s;elf
in a Royal Palace, to Hornifie a Prince
of the Blood, who, to be even with you,
ought to repay you in your own Coin, &s;o
&s;oon as ever you are Married, and to
take no le&s;s care of your Wife, than you
have done of his. I &s;hould not trouble
my Head much about the&s;e Fooleries,
<HI>reply'd the Count Laughing out a|loud;</HI>
a Man may be a very hone&s;t
Gentleman, tho he wears a &s;mall pair
of Horns on his Front; becau&s;e Horns
are the Emblem of Strength and Ho|nour;
and never do any harm unle&s;s
you &s;et them on fire. You &s;ay right,
Sir, <HI>an&s;wered the Marquis with a
plea&s;ant Air,</HI> if all the Cul$k$l'd,
Horns &s;hould take fire $word$ once, it
<PB N="98" REF="102">
would &s;et the whole World in a Flame;
and for fear you &s;hould have the Mis|fortune
of being comprehended in this
&V;niver&s;al Conflagration, I would ad|vi&s;e
you never to think of Marrying,
becau&s;e Marriage is a very dangerous
thing for Gentlemen of your Kidney.
Don't divert your &s;elf, Sir, any longer,
<HI>an&s;wer'd the Count coldly,</HI> at the
expence of your Friend, who keeps no|thing
from you, rather congratulate my
Felicity and Happine&s;s. I wi&s;h I could,
dear Friend, <HI>reply'd the Marquis,
rubbing his Forehead,</HI> I am &s;o very
nice in that point, which you call
<HI>Fooleries,</HI> that I fancy already I feel
them tickling and coming out on my
Forehead. O! dear Marquis, whate|ver
you do, never take a Wife, <HI>cry'd
the Count,</HI> for it will certainly be
your fate, 'tis an Inheritance belonging
to all Men. Plague on the&s;e Women,
<HI>an&s;wer'd the Marquis,</HI> they are tick|li&s;h
things. The&s;e Cocquets know too
well how to en&s;nare us whil&s;t they are
Maidens, by their pretended good Hu|mour
and Vertue, and &s;ome &s;ecret
<PB N="99" REF="103">
Charms Nature has be&s;tow'd upon them.
To convince you of this Truth, dear
Friend, <HI>continu'd the Marquis with
much eagerne&s;s,</HI> I mu&s;t tell you, that
ju&s;t now I come from <HI>Mademoi&s;elle
de la Bi&s;que,</HI> who in my Eyes appears
to be as fair as an Angel, and this per|fection
of her Body joyn'd to &s;o charm|ing
a Mode&s;ty, has put my Liberty in
danger, and rob'd my Heart of a great
part of its u&s;ual Tranquility. O! were
you but &s;en&s;ible what various Agitations
I feel within my Heart, in the pre&s;ence
of &s;o redoubtable an Object; Then pray
be &s;incere, Sir, <HI>&s;aid the Count,</HI> and
at la&s;t be free to own, that I am not
&s;o much to blame, as you imagine, but
rather to be pity'd. Truly, Sir, <HI>reply'd
the Marquis,</HI> I &s;carce know whether
you are to blame or to be pity'd; for it
is your own fault not to make your
utmo&s;t re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t a Pa&s;&s;ion,
which is likely to draw you into an A|by&s;s
of Mi&s;eries; I won't deny, but that
my Heart is not altogether proof again&s;t
the powerful Charms of a hand&s;om Wo|man;
but &s;o &s;oon as I find my Heart
<PB N="100" REF="104">
wounded by <HI>Cupid</HI>'s Dart, I retreat in
&s;pight of all the Charms Love can lay
in my way to oppo&s;e it. I fight him
like a bold Soldier, and oftentimes lay
him at my Feet. Alas, Sir, <HI>reply'd
the Count with a deep Sigh,</HI> you
never were as yet wounded to the quick,
by his Darts, if this Deity &s;hould once
give you a home &s;troak, you would talk
at a quite different rate from what you
now do. The greate&s;t Philo&s;ophers in the
World, are frequently put to a nonplus,
and u&s;e all their Strength upon &s;uch like
an occa&s;ion in vain. I find then that all
the Precepts of Vertue and Wi&s;dom, I
have given you, are lo&s;t upon you, <HI>re|ply'd
the Marquis ari&s;ing from his
Seat, and taking his Hat and put|ting
it clo&s;e to his Head,</HI> Then
pu&s;h on your Pa&s;&s;ion as far as it will
go, and as for me I will take care to
enjoy my happy Indifferency and Tran|quility
as long as po&s;&s;ibly I can. <HI>So
the&s;e two Gentlemen embracing one
another, parted for that time. The
Count</HI> de Guiche <HI>took his Road to|wards
the Wood of</HI> Vincenne, <HI>his
<PB N="101" REF="105">
&s;ual Solitude, where he &s;pent his
time in ruminating upon the Advice
his Friend had given him, but 'tis in
vain to talk to a Lover of Danger;
wherefore we will leave him to his
own Thoughts, and &s;ee what the
Dutche&s;s of&mdash;writ to him.</HI></P>
<P>&startq;ALas! Dear Count, to Love
&s;uch a Per&s;on as you, what
Inconveniencies is one not obliged
to undergo! My whole Mind is
taken up with the Impre&s;&s;ions you
have made there, and which pur|&s;ue
me wherever I go, and will
not leave me; let me do what I
can to keep them at a di&s;tance.
The&s;e Impre&s;&s;ions, tho never &s;o a|greeable
to my Inclinations, never|thele&s;s
are Enemies to my Repo&s;e
and Tranquility; Remember, my
Lovely Count, at what a rate I
purcha&s;e the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing
you, and don't forget the Obliga|tion
you owe me, becau&s;e it &s;tands
me in more than you. Make ha&s;te

ask'd him, Whether he would &s;end

I am very glad of it, my Dear, <HI>&s;aid

<P><HI>The Duke of</HI> O&mdash;s <HI>being ex|treamly
plea&s;ed with his late Di&s;|gui&s;e
in a Pedlars Habit, when he
went to Madam</HI> d' Olone, <HI>had the
Curio&s;ity of contriving another,
which he believed would be no le&s;s
becoming to him than the other had
been. Knowing that Madam</HI> de

Monte&s;pan <HI>wanted a Chamber maid,
he dre&s;s'd him&s;elf in Womens Appa|rel,
pretending to be not long
ago come out of the Country; and
being ask'd by the Lady what &s;he
wanted with her;</HI> Good Morrow,
Madam, <HI>&s;aid Mrs.</HI> Pierette, I was told
you wanted one to wait on you in your
Chamber, and am come to offer you my
Service. Where did you live before,
<HI>&s;aid Madam</HI> Monte&s;pan <HI>looking her
in the Face,</HI> I lived, Madam, <HI>&s;aid
&s;he, making a low Reverence,</HI> at the
Counte&s;s of &hellip;. a Lady the
harde&s;t to be plea&s;ed of any Woman
living, and who will have every thing
done to the greate&s;t nicety; For all
this, I had not left her Service, had it
not been for a great lu&s;ty Page of hers,
who would be always playing the Fool
with me, and dirty my Linnen, let me
do what I would: You know, Madam,
nothing ought to be &s;o precious to a
Young Woman as her Reputation, and
how careful we mu&s;t be in not hearken|ing
to the Impertinent Di&s;cour&s;es of
Men. You are in the right of it, <HI>&s;aid
<PB N="110" REF="114">
the Marchione&s;s Laughing,</HI> but after
all, do you imagine, that the Females
in my Family are not as game&s;ome as
the Males? Don't deceive your &s;elf,
they love a little Play as well as the
great lu&s;ty Page you &s;ay loved you.
Alas, Madam, <HI>reply'd Mrs.</HI> Pierret,
<HI>with much re&s;ervedne&s;s,</HI> call you that
Love, when a Fellow tells his Foole|ries
to a Young Woman like my &s;elf. I
am no Diet for Pages, and would I
have given the lea&s;t Ear to the Imperti|nencies
of their Ma&s;ters, I know &s;ome
of the fir&s;t Quality, who &hellip;.
What is it you call Impertinencies?
<HI>return'd my Lady like one &s;urpriz'd.</HI>
I mean, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Pierette,</HI> their
tender Words and Expre&s;&s;ions, when
they tell us, we are very hand&s;ome,
infinitely Charming, I am in Love with
you, my pretty Child, Could you Love
me again, if I &s;hould Love you?
And a thou&s;and other &s;uch like Foole|ries.
How, Mrs. Pierette, <HI>reply'd
Madam</HI> de Monte&s;pan, call you the&s;e
Honey Words Fooleries? Certainly
you know not the difference, it mu&s;t be
<PB N="111" REF="115">
either for want of Judgment or good
Sen&s;e. That may be, Madam, <HI>an|&s;wered</HI>
Pierette, but be that as it will,
I can't di&s;pen&s;e with the Addre&s;&s;es of
Men. You are a Rarity indeed, my
Dear, <HI>reply'd the Marchione&s;s,</HI> a
Young Woman as you are, not to be A|morous!
I am nothing like it, Madam,
<HI>reply'd the di&s;gui&s;ed Duke with a
feign'd Mode&s;ty,</HI> I never found any
Inclination in my &s;elf that way, and I
can &s;afely &s;wear, that my Fle&s;h and
Sen&s;es were never in Rebellion on that
account. At that rate you are a Saint,
<HI>&s;aid Madam</HI> de Monte&s;pan <HI>je&s;tingly,</HI>
or el&s;e Nature mu&s;t have &s;poil'd in you,
what it has be&s;tow'd as a Gift upon other
People: For, the greate&s;t Saints
tell us, that every Body of this World
is &s;ubject to Temptations and Human
Frailties. I can't tell, Madam, <HI>re|ply'd</HI>
Pierette <HI>with a Blu&s;h,</HI> I have
felt my &s;elf all over, and can't find but
that I am like other People, except my
Heart, who&s;e only Inclinations are for
&s;uch Lovely Ladies as you are. Oh!

this is the fir&s;t time you &s;ee me, <HI>re|ply'd
the Marchione&s;s with a &s;corn|ful

none of her Maids at hand, com|ply'd

pulling off her Night-gown, and
&s;hewing her naked Neck and Bo&s;om,
(which was Beautiful to a Miracle)
he forgot the Part he was to act,
and</HI> Alas! <HI>cry'd he,</HI> Madam, no Man,
thanks be to Heaven, was ever able to

good Woman, <HI>an&s;wered Madam</HI> de

I verily believe you are &s;omething more

Madam, <HI>reply'd the pretended Young
Woman ki&s;&s;ing her Shoulders, which
happened to be naked,</HI> it is not in my
power to hurt your lovely Sex. Alas!
my Dear, <HI>return'd the Marchione&s;s
much &s;urpriz'd,</HI> I dare lay odds you
are an Hermaphrodite, and that is the
rea&s;on why you are not fond of Man|kind,
or at lea&s;t you &s;hare your Incli|nations

I never lo&s;t my Maidenhead, as yet.
Would you take your Oath upon it,

<HI>Laughing,</HI> Women of your Age &s;el|dom

for a Woman to part with &s;o

&s;erious Air,</HI> thanks to St. <HI>Lucerne,</HI>

I congratulate my &s;elf, <HI>added

you to undervalue your own Me|rits

I Love you to a degree of Folly,
<HI>cry'd he,</HI> and unle&s;s you remove by

other Lovers do, Sir, <HI>&s;aid the Lady
Laughing,</HI> I mean in their Letters,
when they die and are revived again
when they plea&s;e, or at lea&s;t according

the ab&s;ence of his adored Beauty, coming
frequently to a &s;mall Rivulet, to bewail
his Misfortunes, his Tears &s;well'd the

de Monte&s;pan, <HI>who is none of

her Head to dive into the meaning
of this Riddle; &s;he thought it &s;uffi|cient

&s;tead to increa&s;e and fix the Duke of</HI>
O&mdash;s <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion, who generally loved
the Fair Sex only by Fits. The&s;e
two Lovers, after having &s;pent &s;ome
time longer in Tender Expre&s;&s;ions, and
given one to the other certain proofs
of their new Engagement took leave
of one another for that time.</HI></P>
<P>'Twas not long before it was
known at Court, that the Duke of
<HI>O&mdash;s</HI> was fal'n in Love with this
Lady; whereat &s;ome were plea&s;ed,
others di&s;plea&s;ed. Among the fir&s;t
was the Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI> who flat|ter'd
him&s;elf, that this Amorous A|mu&s;ement
would divert the Duke
from his Jealou&s;ie, and in the mean
while took care to improve the
Duke's Ab&s;ence to his Advantage.
The Dutche&s;s of&mdash;who had
promi&s;ed the Count to play the Duke
a Trick at their next Meeting, to be
<PB N="120" REF="124">
even with him for his Mi&s;tru&s;tful
Temper, cau&s;ed two Wooden Heads
to be made, one whereof re&s;embling
a Man, the other that of a Woman.
The&s;e were laid in her Bed, their
Heads neatly dre&s;s'd. The Duke
happening to come home pretty late
that Night from Playing at Cards,
went &s;oftly into the Dutche&s;&s;es
Chamber, drew near to the Bed, and
&s;eeing two Heads there lying clo&s;e
together A&s;leep, as he &s;uppo&s;ed, did
not in the lea&s;t doubt, but that it
was his Spou&s;e whom he had thus
catch'd. <HI>Now I have you,</HI> &s;aid the
Duke, <HI>you have play'd this Game, I
&s;uppo&s;e often before, but now I am re|&s;olved
to revenge my &s;elf: I am re&s;ol|ved,
Traytor,</HI> added he, ca&s;ting a
mo&s;t furious Look at one of the
Heads (which he thought re&s;embled
the Count <HI>de Guiche) to run my
Sword in a thou&s;and Places through
thy Body, to make thee expiate thy Crime.
And as for you, faithle&s;s Spou&s;e, who
thus Sacrifice me to a Man &s;o little de|&s;erving
your Favours, what mu&s;t I do,
<PB N="121" REF="125">
to puni&s;h you according to your De|&s;erts,
for &s;o enormous a Sin. Yes, yes,</HI>
continued the Duke almo&s;t di&s;tra|cted
with Fury, <HI>you de&s;erve both to
be Sacrific'd together, and nothing &s;hall
hinder me from &s;hedding your Blood.</HI>
At the&s;e words &s;topping a little, and
advancing to touch their Bodies, he
had only &s;een thro' the opening of
the Curtains hitherto, he found them
to be hard and without motion:
<HI>Alas!</HI> cry'd he, <HI>they have play'd me a
Trick,</HI> and &s;o went to his own Bed-chamber
as &s;oft as he could, without
any Attendance, in hopes that in &s;o
doing his folly might remain undi&s;|covered.</P>
<P><HI>The Dutche&s;s of&mdash;and the
Count</HI> de Guiche, <HI>who were lock'd
up together in a Clo&s;et adjacent to
the Bed-chamber where the Heads
were laid, were ready to bur&s;t with
Laughing, and &s;aid one to another
with a low Voice,</HI> The Fox is catch'd,
the Fox is catch'd, we have at la&s;t de|ceived

<PB N="122" REF="126">
Madam, <HI>&s;aid the Count Laughing,</HI>
the Duke to have been of &s;o jealous and

&s;hould be very glad to know what were
his real Thoughts, when he &s;aid, <HI>Tray|tor,
I will run my Sword thro' thy

Count, <HI>reply'd the Dutche&s;s Smiling,</HI>
without all doubt he &s;uppo&s;ed it was

for you? No&punc; Madam, <HI>an&s;wer|ed

part. I am very &s;orry for it Count,
<HI>an&s;wered &s;he with a Sigh.</HI> And what
is it, mo&s;t Divine Lady, <HI>reply'd he
with a mo&s;t Pa&s;&s;ionate Air,</HI> that makes
you imagine that the&s;e Reproaches,
which doubtle&s;s would have touch'd me

a Charming Air,</HI> and Mademoi&s;elle

than your due, when &s;he told me t'other
day that you were the mo&s;t gallant and
the mo&s;t engaging Per&s;on at Court.
How much am I indebted to you, my
Incomparable Lady, <HI>cry'd the Count</HI>
de Guiche, <HI>quire tran&s;ported with
Joy,</HI> to rai&s;e the Value of what this
Young Woman was plea&s;ed to &s;ay of
me, to &s;o high a rate; her Incen&s;e is
very incon&s;iderable in compari&s;on to
yours, Madam; the lea&s;t grain of
yours, &s;ends forth a mo&s;t odoriferous
Scent, which revives and rejoyces our
Hearts. And what Sweets, what In|cen&s;es
are the&s;e, my dear Count, <HI>&s;aid
the Lady Laughing,</HI> I am obliged to
you for? I know not how I &s;hall be a|ble

favourable Look, Madam, <HI>reply'd this

more than enough to pay a Debt not

make a return for your Charming Good|ne&s;s
and Infinite Favours: But alas, I
fear &hellip;. What is it you fear,
Count? <HI>reply'd the Dutche&s;s looking
at him, and gue&s;&s;ing at his meaning,</HI>
When one has truly engaged ones Heart
'tis no ea&s;ie Task to have it again at
ones own di&s;po&s;al. Madam, <HI>reply'd
the Count full of Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> your Me|rits
ought to challenge an infinite Ac|knowledgment;
&s;uch a one as a mortal
Man is incapable of giving you, &s;ince
the Homage and Incen&s;e of the World

plea&s;e. So that after all, Sir, <HI>&s;aid the
Dutche&s;s in a Maje&s;tick manner,</HI> you
had but a very ill Opinion of this Ge|nerous
Spou&s;e, &s;o that if &s;he &s;hould
have put upon you, it was doubtle&s;s to
be even with you, for all tho&s;e ill
grounded and unju&s;t Notions you had
conceived of her: To be &s;hort, it was
conceived, that the Count <HI>de&mdash;</HI>
kept Company with the Dutche&s;s of

Gallant Per&s;on, has a &hellip;. for
ingratiating him&s;elf with the Ladies
&hellip;. I know it very well, Ma|dam,
<HI>reply'd the Duke coldly,</HI> and
that you &s;ay nothing but what is actu|ally
<PB N="127" REF="131">
the Truth, tho it be &s;poken in je&s;t;
'tis for this rea&s;on this &s;o charming

and Bi&s;hops of Fortune, who are
&s;tiled the <HI>Black Dragoons of Gallan|try,</HI>
becau&s;e abundance of Ladies pa&s;s
thro' their hands; and it was under
this Sanctify'd Habit, the Count <HI>de</HI>
&mdash;Dragoon'd the other Night,
the Counte&s;s <HI>of the Green;</HI> whom he
run almo&s;t thro' the Body, tho without
doing her any con&s;iderable harm; and
I can tell you why he did not, it was
becau&s;e this Gallant Dragoon found the
Hole made to his Hand by his Collo|nel,
who had mounted the Breach be|fore
him.</P>
<P><HI>The Duke of&mdash;who had
related this enigmatical Story; $$ief|ly
to di&s;compo&s;e the Dutche&s;s on
account of the Count</HI> de Guiche,
<HI>thought him&s;elf in &s;ome mea&s;ure
reveng'd for the Trick they had play'd
him; and tho the Dutche&s;s wanted
not Sen&s;e to gue&s;s at his Intentions,
yet could &s;he not forbear to enter|tain
a &s;trong Su&s;picion, that the
<PB N="128" REF="132">
Count was Unfaithful, and that he
often vi&s;ited the Counte&s;s</HI> de Olone,
<HI>unto whom they had given the Ti|tle
of the Counte&s;s</HI> of the Green <HI>at
Court, becau&s;e &s;he always hoped
for &s;ome fre&s;h Favours from her Gal|lants,
tho they treated her never &s;o
indifferently, and that the Collonel
of the</HI> Black Dragoons, <HI>was the Duke
of</HI> O&mdash;<HI>who &s;hared her Fa|vours
with him without his Know|ledge.
The&s;e Su&s;picions having put
the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;into a very
ill Humour, (tho &s;he di&s;&s;embled it
as much as po&s;&s;ibly &s;he could) &s;he
took this Opportunity of continuing
her Raillery in regard to the Game
&s;he had play'd her Spou&s;e, by way
of retaliation for his mi&s;tru&s;ting her
Fidelity, which &s;he &s;aid, was proof
again&s;t the mo&s;t powerful Charms in
the World.</HI> 'Tis a difficult Task,
<HI>&s;aid the Duke with a Smile,</HI> to in|dulge
ones Sen&s;es, without feeling the
Effects of their Enchantments; e&s;peci|ally
&s;uch a Lady as you, who being all
Charms, whenever &s;he attempts to re&s;i&s;t
<PB N="129" REF="133">
tho&s;e Temptations, &s;he never fails to
meet with &s;omething or other which
deceives and draws her away into
the &s;umptuou&s;ne&s;s and Plea&s;ures of &s;o
engaging a Court as ours is; Remem|ber
what a va&s;t number of Sighs and
Addre&s;&s;es are made to; what Homage
are paid you, and how often they meet
with an agreeable Reception from you.
From me, Sir, <HI>reply'd the Dutche&s;s
with a deal of Mode&s;ty,</HI> I never
minded any others but yours, tho' you
are very &s;paring with them. I am too
well ver&s;ed in the Art of Love, Madam,
<HI>reply'd the Duke,</HI> not to under&s;tand
that it is no more than a charitable
Piece of Morality to give a favourable
acceptance to &s;ome Sighs that fall acci|dentally
in ones way. Then, Sir, <HI>re|ply'd
the Dutche&s;s with much Indif|ferency,</HI>
you may make u&s;e of this Gal|lant
Morality, be &s;ure to catch up all
the Sighs the Ladies &s;end to you, both
from the right and left &s;ide. Yes, &s;o I
will, Madam, <HI>reply'd the Duke mer|rily,</HI>
when I think them worth my
while, and that they de&s;erve it, becau&s;e
<PB N="130" REF="134">
I intend to lay up good &s;tore of them.
But, <HI>continued he &s;ighing,</HI> I &s;hould
be extreamly plea&s;ed, if the Dutche&s;s
and Counte&s;s of &hellip;. would
afford me &s;ome of their Sighs, I would
be ready to return them, without &s;uffer|ing
them to remain in a langui&s;hing
Condition, and all this purely out of a
Motive of Charity, a Man can't well
refu&s;e to the&s;e Fair Ladies, who aim at
every Heart that comes in &s;ight of them,
I promi&s;e you, Sir, <HI>&s;aid the Dutche&s;s
of&mdash;with a pretended In|gaging
Air,</HI> I will, out of another
Motive of Charity acquaint them with
it, if you think fit, perhaps they are not
&s;en&s;ible as yet of tho&s;e advantageous
Sentiments you have for them. That
may be, <HI>reply'd the Duke,</HI> I return
you many thanks for your mo&s;t extra|ordinary
and obliging care; but I have
$word$ to let them know it my &s;elf, I
will be the Me&s;&s;enger that carries this
News; I don't care for a third Per&s;on,
nor for any Confidents in Love. You
take it to a nicety, Sir, <HI>added &s;he &s;mi|ling,</HI>
for at that rate you need not fear
<PB N="131" REF="135">
to be brtray'd, provided you can but
keep your Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Favours to your
&s;elf. Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, <HI>&s;aid the Duke with
a &s;eeming Surprize,</HI> for a Per&s;on of
my Temper, Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, I &s;ay once more!
The Counte&s;s <HI>d' Olone</HI> has not been
&s;paring to &s;ay, I am no Lover of Wo|men,
and that my Inclinations are for
a wor&s;e Game&punc; Nay, &s;he has told it to
Father <HI>Anet</HI> and Father <HI>Bovanne,</HI> who
have &s;poke to me about it. And will
you pardon her &s;uch a piece of Impu|dence,
<HI>&s;aid the Dutche&s;s Laughing,</HI>
certainly &s;he has found out a way of en|dearing
you to her, becau&s;e you treat
her &s;o tenderly, whereas, if any Body
el&s;e had done &s;o, there would have been
not the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of a Reconciliation.
What would you have me do with her,
Madam, <HI>&s;aid the Duke,</HI> &s;he is a Wo|man
that will talk of every thing, whe|ther
&s;he knows any thing of the Matter,
or not; and for that rea&s;on, I never
mind her. Sir, <HI>reply'd the Dutche&s;s
&s;miling,</HI> I would have you give a more
agreeable Turn to the Matter, &s;ay with
a Tender Air, I forgive her every
<PB N="132" REF="136">
thing, becau&s;e I Love and Adore her,
and none but the Counte&s;s of <HI>the Green</HI>
is able to reach your Heart. I now no
more doubt, but that you was the Collo|nel
of the <HI>Black Dragoons,</HI> who has
Dragoon'd her &s;o often, which I never
knew before; but, <HI>continued &s;he,</HI> the
Mouth will &s;peak what the Heart is full
of; you have been &s;o good as to tell it
me, before I enquired after it, imagin|ing,
perhaps, I had not wit enough to
unfold &s;o intricate a Riddle; the Fair
Lady has wounded you with her affect|ed
Inticements, and you have given her
a Wound another way. Come, come,
Sir, another time keep your Love My|&s;teries
clo&s;er, and don't divulge them
in Figures to &s;uch a one as my &s;elf,
who has &s;o near a Concern in it.
<HI>She had no &s;ooner &s;aid the&s;e words,
but &s;he went out of the Room, lea|ving
the Duke alone in a very deep
Study, and not a little vex'd at him|&s;elf,
for having &s;aid more than he
&s;hould have done; for whil&s;t he
thought to put upon the Dutche&s;s,
in relating to her on$ of the Count's
<PB N="133" REF="137">
Gallantries, and reproaching her for
hers, he was catch'd in the Snare
him&s;elf; &s;o that he was &s;carce in a
good Humour for a Month after.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Dutche&s;s of&mdash;who
had conceal'd hither what had been
told her concerning the Count, could
not forbear one Night, when they
were indulging their Pa&s;&s;ion, by the
light of the Moon, to reveal it to
him. The Count extreamly &s;urpri|zed
at what he heard her &s;ay,</HI> Madam,
<HI>an&s;wer'd he with a mo&s;t Sincere Air,</HI>
you charge me with the blacke&s;t Infide|lity
in the World; is it po&s;&s;ible to ima|gine
I &s;hould betray the Goodne&s;s and
Favours of the mo&s;t Adorable Lady li|ving?
No, no, entertain more advan|tageous
Sentiments of my Heart, mo&s;t
Divine Lady, and don't wrong me &s;o
far, as to believe me &V;nfaithful. I
know not what to &s;ay to the Matter,
Count, <HI>reply'd the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;
with a Langui&s;hing Air,</HI> you are of
the &s;ame Stamp as all other Men are;
they love Change, tho' they were belo|ved
by an Angel, 'tis Variety that
<PB N="134" REF="138">
Charms them, and &s;ea&s;ons all their
Plea&s;ures: We mu&s;t have &s;omething
that is new, &s;ay they, to move and
rou&s;e our Spirits, a thing not to be ex|pected,
from a worn out Pa&s;&s;ion and
Sighs. I can't deny, Madam, <HI>reply'd
the Count</HI> de Guiche <HI>Smiling,</HI> that
the fir&s;t beginning of a Pa&s;&s;ion, has &s;ome|thing
that is very Charming in it, but
when a Man once is in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the Heart of &s;o incomparable a Lady as
you are, all Novelties lo&s;e their force
and Charms; there is no Engagement
on Earth &s;o &s;trong, but what would
break its Chains to change them with
Joy for yours; and put the highe&s;t
pitch of his Felicity in wearing them:
The Greate&s;t Kings of the World, <HI>ad|ded
he with a very Pa&s;&s;ionate Air,</HI>
would envy my Happine&s;s, were they
&s;en&s;ible of it. Without Di&s;&s;imulation
or Flattery, Count, <HI>&s;aid the Dutche&s;s
with a mo&s;t ingaging Air,</HI> tell me
&s;incerely, does not this Lady do you a
Favour now and then? How many A|morous
Robberies have you committed
upon her? If you will make an inge|nuous
<PB N="135" REF="139">
Confe&s;&s;ion, you will much oblige
and plea&s;e me. Would you have me
tell you, Madam, without di&s;&s;embling
the Matter, <HI>reply'd the Count Laugh|ing,</HI>
her Favours are too common to co|vet
or to be fond of them; &s;he is one
of tho&s;e who are not very nice in a Gal|lant,
provided he &hellip;. I un|der&s;tand
what you would &s;ay, Sir, <HI>re|ply'd
the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;Laugh|ing,</HI>
but pray be good humour'd, and
give me a relation of one of your Noctur|nal
A&s;&s;ignations, becau&s;e I am inform|ed,
that whenever you go there, it is
in the Night time, under the Di&s;gui&s;e
of one of the <HI>Black Dragoons,</HI> or of
an <HI>Hermit.</HI> What is the meaning,
Madam, <HI>reply'd the Count interrup|ting
her,</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Black Dragoons?</HI>
I never knew Gallantry to be Mar&s;hal'd
into a Regiment. I am apt to believe
it mu&s;t be &s;o, Count, <HI>an&s;wered the
Dutche&s;s coldly,</HI> becau&s;e they put, as
it &s;eems you <HI>Cavalier Adventurers</HI> in|to
the &s;ame Rank with the <HI>Black Coats
with little Bands,</HI> this is the Character
the Wits of the Town be&s;tow upon you.
<PB N="136" REF="140">
A pretty Compari&s;on! Madam, <HI>reply'd
the Count laughing aloud;</HI> but not
to forget your Ladi&s;hips Commands of
relating to you one of my A&s;&s;ignations
with <HI>the Counte&s;s of the Green.</HI> I
will tell you, I had the Curio&s;ity one
Night to di&s;gui&s;e my &s;elf like an Abbot,
knowing this Lady to be exceeding
fond of the&s;e Favourites of <HI>Venus;</HI> &s;he
did not in the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pect it to be me,
notwith&s;tanding which, I never came
&s;o much.. to the <HI>Critical Minute,</HI>
in all my Life time before, as I did at
time, had I been in a humour to im|prove
it to the utmo&s;t of her Wi&s;h; be|cau&s;e
&s;he actually mi&s;took me for one of
tho&s;e <HI>Black Divinities,</HI> who u&s;ed to
bring along with them the &s;ame Golden
Rain, which <HI>Jupiter</HI> pour'd upon <HI>Dia|na;</HI>
but &s;uch was her forwardne&s;s, &s;uch
was her Confident Depertment, that
it quite check'd my Inclinations, could
I have had any for &s;uch a Woman as
&s;he is. She lay in a loo&s;e Garb upon a
Couch, in &s;o indecent a po&s;ture as was
enough to check a Man of my Kidney;
&s;he had nothing but a Gaw&s;e Yellow
<PB N="137" REF="141">
Night-Gown wrapt about her, through
which you might &s;ee her Body almo&s;t
half naked, and her curl'd Hair &s;pread
about her Neck and Bo&s;om, which in|deed
is none of the wor&s;t. She embra|ced
me mo&s;t tenderly, believing me to
be the Abbot <HI>de Bois,</HI> whom &s;he is ex|ceeding
fond of, tho he has not &s;een
him above twice or thrice in all her
Life. But 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to tell you
how &s;he loaded me with Reproaches and
Injurious Words, when &s;he found me
not ready for her turn; &s;o that I had
no other way left me than to decamp in
good time, and get out of her &s;ight,
which I did, and &s;wore heartily I
would never come near her again.</P>
<P>And have you kept this Oath, Count,
<HI>reply'd the Dutche&s;s looking in his
Face,</HI> Lovers you know, will be Per|jur'd
and &V;nfaithful: Dont Blu&s;h,
<HI>continn'd &s;he,</HI> for tho' it be not Day|light,
I &s;ee your Heart betrays you in
&s;pite of your &s;elf, and that now and
then you improve the <HI>Critical Minute,</HI>
under your Sanctify'd Habit.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="142">
Not in the lea&s;t, Madam,, <HI>&s;aid the
Count Laughing aloud;</HI> but I will
tell you another Adventure, the mo&s;t
delightful I ever met with &s;ince I was
born: I had di&s;guis'd my &s;elf like an
<HI>Hermit,</HI> and in that Habit was &s;urpri|&s;ed
in her Company by the Count <HI>de
Olone,</HI> her Husband, whil&s;t I was en|deavouring
to make a Convert of her,
and to infu&s;e into her &s;uch Sentiments
as might lead her to a Holy Life; but
Alas! If you had but &s;een what a fright
my Penitent Lady was in, when &s;he &s;aw
him come in! However &s;he had imme|diate
recour&s;e to her u&s;ual Inventions,
to amu&s;e the poor Man, whom &s;he told,
with a great deal of fawning Ingenui|ty:
Sir, this is the &s;o much celebrated
Father of the Order of St. <HI>Augu&s;tin,</HI>
for his &s;ingular Vertues and Morality,
who having left his Convent, is retired
into a &s;olitary Grotto, to lead a more
Au&s;tere and Holy Life: He is, <HI>added
&s;he,</HI> a true Saint in all re&s;pects; he
comes from time to time <HI>incognito</HI> to
<HI>Paris,</HI> to preach Penitence to Sinners,
and e&s;pecially to &s;uch Sinners, as being
<PB N="139" REF="143">
addicted altogether to the Plea&s;ures of
this World, are like lo&s;t Sheep, who
being gone a&s;tray, are upon the Brink of
tumbling into the Precipice of Hell.
<HI>The good Man being very ready to
believe every word &s;he told him,
gave me a favourable Reception, and
you may imagine, I took care to act
the Hypocrite and Father of Peni|tence
to the Life, and that when he
ask'd my Ble&s;&s;ing, I was &s;ure to give
it him very plentifully, wi&s;hing him
a thou&s;and Temporal and Spiritual
Pro&s;perities, and an Encrea&s;e of
Riches and Honours in his Family.
He was &s;o well plea&s;ed with my ten|der
Expre&s;&s;ions, that ki&s;&s;ing my
Hand, he pray'd me mo&s;t earne&s;tly
to &s;tay at his Hou&s;e for &s;ome days,
which I liked extreamly well, being
at that time in Love with the Coun|te&s;s,
as &s;he &s;aid &s;he was with me.</HI>
Madam, I give you leave to gue&s;s, <HI>con|tinued
he Laughing,</HI> what ble&s;&s;ed Re|formation
of Life I preach'd, and what
glorious Precepts of Morality I infu&s;ed
into her; for I pretended to addre&s;s
<PB N="140" REF="144">
my Prayers every Day to the Saints,
and all the happy Intelligences of the
Paradice after the Sanctification of all
&s;uch good Souls as the Count and Coun|te&s;s's
were.</P>
<P>One Night, Madam, as we were at
Supper, after having imparted them my
Benediction, <HI>the Count</HI> d' Olone <HI>ask'd
me with a Pious Look,</HI> unto what
Saint belonged that Holy Relick I wore
fastned to a thick Cord, wherewith I
ty'd my upper Garment in&s;tead of a
Girdle; and whether I found not a
great Inconveniency in my long Beard?
No, Sir, <HI>&s;aid I, lifting up my Eyes
towards Heaven,</HI> the hopes of attain|ing
to Cele&s;tial Beatitude, makes us
poor <HI>Hermits</HI> in&s;en&s;ible of every thing
on Earth, our whole time being taken
up with nothing but Pious and Sancti|fy'd
Thoughts. Father, <HI>cry'd the
Count</HI> d' Olone <HI>touch'd to the Heart,</HI>
'tis true, we poor Mortals can't &s;uffici|ently
admire tho&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings Heaven
pours out upon &s;uch Per&s;ons as you are,

of this World, and of your Sen&s;es.
You are plump, have a fre&s;h Colour, and
live with Content, tho' you feed in your
Hermitage upon nothing but Roots and
Milk Meats; the&s;e are &s;trange Won|ders,
pa&s;t the Apprehen&s;ion of &s;o mi&s;e|rable
a Sinner as I am. Sir, <HI>an&s;wered
I,</HI> I don't live at all times upon &s;uch
&s;pare Dyet, it happens pretty often that
I feed upon all &s;orts of Meats, without
di&s;tinction, &s;uch as the Creator of Na|ture
has be&s;tow'd upon Mankind for
their Benifit; we are not forbidden by
the Rules of our Order, to eat Fle&s;h and
other things upon an occa&s;ion, provided
we ab&s;tain from Women, a Woman be|ing
the forbidden Fruit to us. But pray
Father, <HI>reply'd the Count with a
Compa&s;&s;ionate Air,</HI> what can you do
when you feel the Temptations of the
Fle&s;h within you? You, who are in the
Bloom of your Youth, aud in perfect
Health, certainly you undergo a kind
of Martyrdom in that re&s;pect, and
therefore this your Cha&s;te and Glorious

good Father, who&s;e is this little Skin?
Sir, <HI>reply'd I coldly,</HI> this is the Mai|denhead
of St. <HI>Hypolita,</HI> who has gi|ven
it into the Cu&s;tody of the Founder
of the <HI>Hermits,</HI> who keep it each in
turn by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and who are bound
to pre&s;erve it entire as a mo&s;t Holy and
Precious Relick. Oh! Father, <HI>cry'd
the Count,</HI> a mo&s;t Sacred and Valua|ble
Piece, you are entru&s;ted with; &s;ure|ly
no Body mu&s;t touch it except your
&s;elf, for fear of defiling it. Neither
do I &s;uffer every Body to touch it, <HI>&s;aid
I,</HI> unle&s;s I know them to be Holy, and
not &s;ubject to the Temptations of the
Fle&s;h. You are very much in the right
on't, Father, <HI>reply'd the Counte&s;s
acting the Zealot,</HI> to pre&s;erve the&s;e
precious Relicks undefiled, for every
Body is de&s;irous to have &s;ome Relicks
of Saints, becau&s;e they have a great
Vertue of curing People of many other|wi&s;e
<PB N="145" REF="149">
incurable Di&s;tempers. I am very
&s;en&s;ible of that by my &s;elf, Madam,
<HI>cry'd I with a Pious Tran&s;port,</HI> alas!
had it not been for that very Relick
you now have in your Hand, how often
would my human Frailties have been
forced to &s;uccumb under the Burthen of
my Carnal Temptations; and how of|ten
has this little Skin when I look at
it and con&s;idered of its Vertues, rai&s;ed
and &s;upported my Strength and Rea&s;on,
which was ready to drop and almo&s;t at
the la&s;t ga&s;p. I believe it, Father,
<HI>&s;aid the Count</HI> d' Olone, pray let me
&s;tand &s;o far indebted to you, as to have
from your Hands one of your Relicks,
which I will promi&s;e to keep for your
&s;ake, and to make u&s;e of upon occa&s;ion.
<HI>I unty'd immediately a &s;mall Box
hanging on my Cord, wherein were
&s;ome of St.</HI> Francis de Salle'<HI>s Hairs,
which I pre&s;ented him with, where|at
the good Man was &s;o rejoyced,
(as imagining no otherwi&s;e than
that he had a great Booty) that he
return'd me a thou&s;and Thanks and
Civilities.</HI> Where had you the&s;e Re|licks,
<PB N="146" REF="150">
Sir, <HI>&s;aid the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;
Smiling,</HI> you made &s;o much noi&s;e of,
on purpo&s;e to put upon &s;uch poor &s;imple
Wretches as the Count <HI>d' Olone</HI> is.
They were of my own making, Madam,
return'd <HI>the Count</HI> de Guiche <HI>coldly,</HI>
I &s;pent, <HI>continued he,</HI> &s;ome Days lon|ger
very merrily with the Counte&s;s, be|ing
very kindly entertain'd by her <HI>good
Spou&s;e,</HI> who often would give me an
Opportunity of being with her in pri|vate,
in hopes I might make her a Con|vert;
and to &s;peak the truth, I gave
her mo&s;t excellent Precepts of Morality
over the Left Shoulder, and put &s;uch
plea&s;ing In&s;tructions into her Mind,
that &s;he &s;oon became a very learned Scho|lar,
and outdid me in little time in
the Practical part, having been under
the Tuition of &s;everal able Masters be|fore:
At la&s;t, being obliged to take my
leave of my dear Scholar, her Husband
gave me a thou&s;and Thanks for tho&s;e
Pious Le&s;&s;ons I had be&s;tow'd upon his
Lad$; in retaliation of which, I gave
him my Ble&s;&s;ing, and of many other
Saints, and &s;o ended the Story.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="151">
And can you believe otherwi&s;e, Count,
<HI>reply'd the Dutche&s;s with a Serious
Air,</HI> that Heaven will not puni&s;h you
for thus acting your Fooleries under the
Cloak of Religion, and thus impo&s;ing
upon the Credulity of others, who mean
no harm? Truly I would not be in your
place for all the World. Lord, Ma|dam,
<HI>reply'd the Count Laughing,</HI>
what would you have Young People do,
when they are in Love? Love and
Devotion &s;eldom agree, long together,
and Young Lovers &s;eldom trouble their
Heads much with Religion. I find it
is &s;o, <HI>reply'd the Dutche&s;s,</HI> by what
you have told me. But does the Coun|te&s;s
&s;till receive &s;o many Vi&s;its as &s;he
u&s;ed to do, from the Marquis <HI>de
Beuveron,</HI> and Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Ca&s;tille,</HI>
that Young Rampant Bully. I believe,
Madam, <HI>reply'd the Counte&s;s Smi|ling,</HI>
for I was told not long ago, that
at this time &s;he is in Love with Abbots
to a high degree of Folly; and that the
two Abbots <HI>Villerceau</HI> and <HI>Fouqnet</HI>
attend her Day and Night; the&s;e
Gentlemen with little Bands are better
<PB N="148" REF="152">
Ma&s;ters in the Art of Love, than poor
<HI>Jack de Ca&s;tille</HI> is; with whom &s;he
was forced to act her part to a Tutor,
and to in&s;truct him what he was to do.
To &s;peak the truth, <HI>continued he mer|rily,</HI>
I pity a Woman of her Temper
when &s;he is &s;o hard put to it, as to be
forced to teach her Gallant his Le&s;&s;on,
and guide him with her own Hand to
his Bu&s;ine&s;s. You are very unlucky,
Count, <HI>&s;aid the Dutche&s;s with a plea|&s;ing
Air,</HI> thus to run upon the poor
Novices of Love; you would not have
every Body be as expert in that Art as
you? Tho, if I may freely tell you my
Sentiments upon that Point, I &s;hould
not much fancy &s;uch a raw and rough|hew'd
Lover, it requires &s;ome Know|ledge
and Experience, to venture upon
a Woman who has a tender Heart. You
&s;ay nothing but what is very true, Ma|dam,
<HI>&s;aith the Count</HI> de Guiche, a
Man that pretends to Gallantry, ought
to make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of that Art, if
he intends to act with good &s;ucce&s;s:
But, Madam, <HI>added he,</HI> what is your
Opinion, concerning Madam <HI>de Cha|tillon,</HI>
<PB N="149" REF="153">
and her Love Intrigues? who
not &s;atisfied with the tender Addre&s;&s;es
of the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> makes not the
lea&s;t Con&s;cience of entertaining &s;everal
other Rivals, that are far below him in
every re&s;pect. And who do you think,
my dear Count, <HI>&s;aid the Dutche&s;s,</HI>
are the&s;e Rivals; are they the Duke of
<HI>Nemours,</HI> and my Lord <HI>Coadjutor,</HI>
who rivals the Prince of <HI>Conde?</HI> O!
Madam, <HI>reply'd the Count,</HI> the&s;e are
taken in only to make up the number of
her other Gallants; I know her Favou|rite
Lover, 'tis Father <HI>Jambiac;</HI> &s;he
Loves him as dearly as her own Life,
and &s;hews all the Duke of <HI>Nemours,</HI>
and the <HI>Coadjutor's</HI> Letters to him. I
am &s;trangely &s;urprized at what you
&s;ay, <HI>Count, reply'd the Dutche&s;s,</HI>
and were it not &s;o very late, I would
de&s;ire you to relate me the whole Story
of it, with all its Circum&s;tances.
<HI>Soon after Day-break beginning to
appear, made the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;
&s;en&s;ible that the Pre&s;ence of a belo|ved
Lover, is &s;eldom trouble&s;ome to
a Woman, and at the &s;ame time that
<PB N="150" REF="154">
it was time to part, for fear of being
&s;urprized by the Duke of&mdash;
who was abroad at Play, and ex|pected
home every Minute.</HI></P>
<P>The Count being withdrawn, and
the Dutche&s;s got into Bed, enter|tain'd
her &s;elf with the plea&s;ing I|dea's
of the great and rare Qualifi|cations
of her Lover, his ple&s;ant and
diverting Humour, his engaging
Air, his Submi&s;&s;ion, his Re&s;pect;
and to be &s;hort, with every thing
that had engaged her Heart to love
him to that degree as &s;he did. The
greate&s;t part of her time, whil&s;t &s;he
was in Bed, being taken up with
the&s;e delightful Thoughts, &s;he did
not ri&s;e the next Day till pretty
late.</P>
<P>On the other hand the Duke of
<HI>O&mdash;s,</HI> &s;eemingly reflecting on
what the Dutche&s;s had told him in
their late Quarrel, meaning the Coun|te&s;s
<HI>d' Olone,</HI> re&s;olved to break off
that Intrigue, which was no hard
matter for him to do, con&s;idering his
Temper, which was not &s;trongly in|clined
<PB N="151" REF="155">
to Women: But to make his
Appearance at Court, in the &s;tation
of a Man of Gallantry, he would
needs act the Lover <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant,</HI> and
make his Addre&s;&s;es to the Counte&s;s
<HI>de Mora,</HI> who was &s;o much admired
by the King him&s;elf, that he would
often &s;ay, in pre&s;ence of many other
Fair Ladies, that were he not pre|ingaged,
he would make his Love
Addre&s;&s;es to none but her &s;elf; for
which he was &s;ometimes cen&s;ured a|mong
the Ladies, who would look up|on
his Expre&s;&s;ions, as &s;omewhat di&s;o|bliging
in a Monarch, who always
profe&s;s'd a great deal of Gallantry
and Pa&s;&s;ion for the Fair Sex.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>O&mdash;s,</HI> encourag'd
by the King, offer'd all his Addre&s;&s;es
and Sighs to the Counte&s;s, and made
her &s;everal mo&s;t magnificent Pre&s;ents.
One Day when the Ladies were a|broad
a Hunting along with the
King, the Duke, di&s;gui&s;ed in a Gyp|&s;ies
Habit, placed him&s;elf in a Wood,
pretending to tell them their good
Fortunes. The Prince <HI>de Conti,</HI> and
<PB N="152" REF="156">
the Count <HI>de Lude,</HI> happen'd to come
by that way with &s;ome of the La|dies,
call'd the Fortune-teller to
them, who told abundance of plea|&s;ing
Curio&s;ities to &s;everal Ladies and
Lords, but more e&s;pecially to the
Dutche&s;s of&mdash;and the Coun|te&s;s
<HI>de Mora,</HI> who were both very
de&s;irous to know of her what was
to be&s;al them, to their Satisfaction,
in the future cour&s;e of their Lives.
She was &s;eated under an old crooked
Tree all covered with Mo&s;s, (where
&s;he &s;aid &s;he u&s;ed often to take her
re&s;t) and ri&s;ing at la&s;t from her Seat,
took hold of the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;
Hand; <HI>Thou art born,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>un|der
a happy Con&s;tellation; the</HI> Sun of
France <HI>was in its highe&s;t Exaltation
at the time of your Nativity; both the
great Luminaries, one whereof governs
the Day and the other the Night, were
in a favourable A&s;pect.</HI> The Dutch|e&s;&s;es
Colour came into her Face, fear|ing
le&s;t this Sorcere&s;s &s;hould tell her

her A&s;&s;ignations with the Count <HI>de
<PB N="153" REF="157">
Guiche,</HI> took the fir&s;t opportunity of
going from her, and putting the

&s;he &s;omewhat di&s;compo&s;ed, <HI>here look

the pretended Sorcere&s;s, <HI>draw nearer,
I have &s;omething more to &s;ay to you,
and which I can't forbear to tell you;
I read in your Phy&s;iognomy, that you
have a Heart full of Tenderne&s;s. How
can&s;t thou tell that, good Woman?</HI>
return'd the Dutche&s;s Laughing.
<HI>Madam,</HI> &s;aid &s;he looking &s;tedfa&s;tly
at her, <HI>I can tell it by your Hairs and
Eyes, which di&s;cover the true Inclina|tions
of mo&s;t People; Our Authors have
written abundance of things concerning
the difference of Hairs and Eyes; which
are, as</HI> Ari&s;totle <HI>tells us, the Looking|gla&s;&s;es
of the Soul, and the faithful
Interpreters of the Motions of our
Hearts. As far as I can &s;ee, good Wo|man,
thou art a Learned Gyp&s;ie,</HI> &s;aid
the Dutche&s;s interrupting her with
a $mile, <HI>where was it thou did&s;t go

Hearts, whereby and by the Conver&s;ati|on
I have had with the mo&s;t Famous
Magicians in the World, who obliged
me with their In&s;tructions, I have at|tained
to the full and perfect knowledge

Dutche&s;s of&mdash;retreating backwards,
<HI>Thou'rt a very dangerous Woman. Not

cry'd the Fortune-teller, <HI>I am very
Complai&s;ant to Per&s;ons of Merit, and
&s;hall be &s;o in particular, to a Lady &s;o

continued &s;he, <HI>indues us with Mild|ne&s;s
and an ea&s;ie Temper, and makes
us never to do evil but but to &s;uch as
are &s;o unfortunate as to de&s;erve it;
then give me leave to tell you, what I
was going to &s;ay concerning your Hairs,
which are Fair, and your Eyes Blue;
&s;uch Per&s;ons are mo&s;t commonly full of

&s;o much in Fa&s;hion in the World.</HI> The
Duke, who had forbore laughing
hitherto, could not contain him&s;elf
any longer from bur&s;ting out into a
laughter at the fooli&s;h Curio&s;ity of
the&s;e Women, which made &s;ome of
the Company &s;ay, <HI>this Sorcere&s;s plays
the Fool with us:</HI> The King, who is
always very generous, ordered &s;ome
Pi&s;toles to be given her, after which
every body gets on Hor&s;eback and
into their Coaches again.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>O&mdash;s</HI> who had
cau&s;ed his Hunting Apparel to be
brought to a place at a great di|&s;tance
from the Wood, &s;oon threw
off his <HI>Gyp&s;ies</HI> Habit and put on his
own, which done he got on Hor&s;e|back,
and overtaking the Company
<PB N="156" REF="160">
in a full Gallop, told them, <HI>he was
heartily &s;orry, &s;ome very important
Bu&s;ine&s;s had detained him, much a|gain&s;t
his will, at home, and robb'd
him for &s;ome time of the Enjoyment of
&s;o charming a Company. O! Sir,</HI> cry'd
the Counte&s;s <HI>de Mora, what pity 'tis
you did not come a few moments &s;oon|er,
you wou'd have bur&s;t your &s;elf with
laughing, to hear what Tricks we were
told by a certain Gyp&s;ie, whom we met
with in the mid&s;t of the next Wood;
and what good News did &s;he tell you,
Madam,</HI> an&s;wer'd the Duke with
much indifferency, <HI>who was it, that
diverted you &s;o well.</HI> The Dutche&s;s
of &hellip; who began to mi&s;tru&s;t it
might be the Duke who had play'd
the Sorcere&s;s, tipp'd the wink upon
the Counte&s;s, to &s;ay no more of the
matter, and &s;o no more was heard
of the Gyp&s;ie.</P>
<P>They went &s;trait to <HI>St Clere,</HI> where
the Duke of <HI>O&mdash;s</HI> had prepared
a mo&s;t magnificent Repa&s;t, and a
Ball, whereat appeared abundance
of Ma&s;ters. The Duke, who&s;e In|clinations
<PB N="157" REF="161">
were at that time altoge|ther
bent upon the Counte&s;s, was
always at her Elbow, which was
no &s;mall addition to her Vanity, the
re&s;t of the Lady's, who &s;oon percei|ved
it, from that time conceived a
mo&s;t mortal &s;pite again&s;t her, a
thing frequently to be ob&s;erved a|mong
Women, who can't without
a great heartburning &s;ee a gallant
Man offer his Incences and Homage
to their Companions. The Duke
delighted no le&s;s in his growing
Pa&s;&s;ion, than the Counte&s;s glory'd
in her Vanity; and 'twas this which
made the mo&s;t refined at Court &s;oon
make their Ob&s;ervations, that &s;he
acted a Votive of Vain Glory, and
he out of a de&s;ire of being look'd
upon as a Man of Gallantry, and to
regain his Reputation in the Court,
&s;ome of whom entertain'd but very
indifferent Sentiments of him on that
account. 'Tis no wonder then, if
this Love Intrigue which had no|thing
that was &s;olid, or &s;uitable to
its nature, to &s;upport it, was of no
<PB N="158" REF="162">
long continuance: Madam <HI>de Mon|te&s;pan</HI>
and the Counte&s;s <HI>de Mora,</HI>
unto whom the Duke had given
&s;ome account of this Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;eeing
their Quarrel revenged in &s;ome mea|&s;ure,
by finding their Rival in the
&s;ame Rank with them&s;elves, were
not &s;paring to enlarge upon the
Matter in their Di&s;cour&s;es, which
coming to the King's Ear, he gene|rou&s;ly
took the Counte&s;&s;es part &s;o
far, as to order them not to &s;peak
of it any more, unle&s;s they intend|ed
to di&s;oblige him.</P>
<P>Mademoi&s;elle de la Valiere, <HI>hap|pening
to be one day in Company,
where they talk'd with much heat
of this Adventure, told them with a
loud Voice but a very engaging Air,
in the King's Pre&s;ence;</HI> Sir, Our Sex
may now call them&s;elves truly happy
and fortunate, becau&s;e it enjoys the
Protection of the Mo&s;t Potent King of
the &V;niver&s;e. O! <HI>Mademoi&s;elle, re|ply'd
this Monarch with a Tender
and Gallant Air,</HI> were all Ladies like
you, there would be no great occa&s;ion
<PB N="159" REF="163">
for taking their Part, and giving them
Protection: Their Merits alone would
be &s;ufficient to &s;upport them again&s;t all
the attempts of the wor&s;t of their Ene|mies
and to plead in their behalf.
Alas, Sir, <HI>reply'd &s;he with a Lan|gui&s;hing
Tone,</HI> it were to be wi&s;h'd,
that all Men had the &s;ame Heroick
Sentiments as your Maje&s;ty has; we
&s;hould not make &s;uch a de&s;pi&s;able and
unhappy Figure in the World; but
good Heavens! How few are there who
can pretend to the &s;ame Character, and
treat us in an honourable manner!
This ought neverthele&s;s, <HI>Mademoi&s;elle,
reply'd the King looking &s;tedfa&s;t on
her,</HI> to be the Character of a Man of
Honour, to act with Probity and Sin|cerity
in reference to the Fair Sex;
what Advantage does a Man get in de|ceiving
a Woman, and afterwards to
divert him&s;elf at her Co&s;t? Certainly
nothing in the World can be more di&s;|ingenuous
than &s;uch a manner of pro|ceeding,
directly contrary to all the
Rules of Genero&s;ity, which ought to be
the in&s;eperable Companion of Per&s;ons
<PB N="160" REF="164">
of a high Extraction; and therefore
we &s;ee, that the&s;e ill de&s;igning Methods
are mo&s;t commonly practi&s;ed by Per&s;ons
of a mean Spirit and Birth. <HI>The Duke
of</HI> O&mdash;s <HI>happening to come in,
no more was &s;aid upon that Head,
becau&s;e he made the Conver&s;ation
run (according to his wonted Cu|&s;tom)
upon &s;everal trifling Matters;
&s;oon after they went to Cards, till
the Company parted.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke who was very &s;en&s;ible
what a noi&s;e his Pa&s;&s;ion for the
Counte&s;s <HI>de Mora</HI> had made at Court,
thought it his be&s;t way to pa&s;s it off
by giving it merry turn; be&s;ides
that he told &s;ome entertaining Pa&s;|&s;ages
relating to this Affair to Ma|dam
<HI>de Longueville,</HI> where happen|ing
to meet with Madam <HI>de Precy,</HI>
he made his Addre&s;&s;es to her, but
met with a cold Reception, that La|dy
di&s;daining &s;o much as to return
an An&s;wer to his di&s;&s;embling Sighs,
to his &s;o much di&s;&s;atisfaction, being
not u&s;ed to &s;ee his Pa&s;&s;ion check'd at
&s;uch a rate. To divert his Mind
<PB N="161" REF="165">
from his Amorous Inquietudes, and
to put him&s;elf into a better Hu|mour,
he thought fit to entertain
&s;ome of the Court Ladies with a
Diverti&s;ement upon the River, unto
which they gave the Name of <HI>Nep|tune</HI>'s
Fea&s;t. The Duke of <HI>O&mdash;s</HI>
here repre&s;ented the God of the Seas
with a Trident in his Hand, &s;eated
on a great Shell drawn by Dolphins,
and follow$d by a great number of
<HI>Tritons,</HI> who play'd upon a Seahorn
with Fi&s;h Bones. The De&s;erts were
&s;erved upon the River <HI>Seine</HI> by the
Nymphs and <HI>Najades</HI> adorned with
Green, and certain <HI>Syrens</HI> &s;eem'd to
catch with Nets what was to be &s;er|ved
up. They brought to the Ta|ble
variety of Di&s;hes of fry'd Fi&s;h
deliciou&s;ly dre&s;s'd, the Di&s;hes being
garni&s;h'd with Flowers, which the
Godde&s;s <HI>Flora</HI> had pre&s;ented them
with for that grand Fea&s;t. No &s;ooner
were the Tables clear'd, but Angling
Rods were brought to each of the
Ladies in &s;mall Enamell'd Baskets of
different Colours; &s;ome of them ca&s;t
<PB N="162" REF="166">
the Angling Hook and Line, in hopes
of catching &s;omething, but in&s;tead
of Fi&s;hes, they &s;aw &s;everal Hearts
link'd to one another fa&s;ten'd to
their Hooks, as likewi&s;e certain A|morous
Billets, two of which we
have thought fit to in&s;ert here.</P>

to the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;</HEAD>
<OPENER>Beauty,</OPENER>
<P>&startq;YOU who have fill'd our Wa|tery
Pallace with &s;o agreea|ble
a murmuring Sound, which
without intermi&s;&s;ion puts me in
mind of your powerful Charms
and Enchantments, give me leave
to let you know what Charming
Impre&s;&s;ion this plea&s;ing Murmuring
noi&s;e has made in my Heart;
which in the mid&s;t of the cool
Element, is all on Fire, and &s;uch a
Fire, as you your &s;elf have rai&s;ed
into &s;o fierce a Flame, that unle&s;s
you take care to extingui&s;h it, I
<PB N="163" REF="167">
&s;hall &s;oon be reduc'd to A&s;hes.
Godde&s;s of Hearts, Perhaps you
will tell me, 'tis in my Power to
extingui&s;h it: No, the whole O|cean
is not enough &s;o much as to
cool, or to dimini&s;h its Ardour.
One of our Rivers, one of the
mo&s;t Gallant ones that belongs to
our Empire told me t'other day,
of your bright &s;hining Perfections,
and dwel't upon that Subject much
longer than I could have wi&s;h'd.
Alas! how do I read this redoubt|able
Rival? Should he but for
once get out of this Watry Road
to entertain you, I am undone, I
have lo&s;t all my Hopes at once;
you will give ear &s;ooner to his
Murmuring Addre&s;&s;es, than to
mine: But remember, my Adora|ble
Dutche&s;s, there is a va&s;t diffe|rence
betwixt Hearts; and, that
tho we were both made of the
&s;ame Mould, we differ very much
in our Qualifications, the one is
a con&s;tant, the other a fickle Lo|ver.
The fir&s;t is a Mind of rari|ty
<PB N="164" REF="168">
in this Age, when the Gods, as
well as Men, take delight in chang|ing
their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. I leave the
Choice to your Di&s;cretion. Fare|wel,
Charming Lady: Remember
that the Tender Pa&s;&s;ion of a Deity,
&s;uch a one as I am, ought not to
be rejected.&endq;</P>

<HEAD>The Second Letter to the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;SO long as I have carry'd my
Current thro' the World, In|comparable
Dutche&s;s, I never &s;aw
&s;o much Beauty, as that which is
natural to you. <HI>Venus</HI> who was
Born from the Ocean, can't chal|lenge
the Precedency to you, and
I am apt to imagine, that the Gra|ces
them&s;elves, her Favourites,
have left her, to enjoy your Com|pany:
Her own Son told me &s;o
this very Morning when he &s;aw
you, and at the &s;ame time &s;truck a
mo&s;t dangerous Dart into my very
Heart, one of tho&s;e this Malicious
<PB N="165" REF="169">
Child had pitch'd upon a very
great number of others he always
carries about him to di&s;per&s;e them
over the Univer&s;e, and to make it
&s;ubmit to his Empire. Alas!
Lovely Godde&s;s, this &s;troak has
touch'd me &s;o to the Quick, as to
find it almo&s;t in&s;upportable. How|ever,
&s;ince I have ob&s;erved a cer|tain
Charming Sweetne&s;s in your
Eyes, which &s;eem to promi&s;e Tran|quility
to &s;uch Unfortunate Men,
as you have been plea&s;ed to make
&s;o, I have not lo&s;t my hopes:
Don't therefore turn away tho&s;e
Langui&s;hing Stars which afford us
&s;uch great and plea&s;ing Influences,
and which &s;peak &s;o much in my
behalf; I can't forbear to tell you,
to my Grief, that all our Rivers
are fallen in Love with you; and
that in the va&s;t extent of our Em|pire,
we hear &s;carce any thing Day
and Night, but their tender Mur|murings,
every one of them &s;hew|ing
a great Eagerne&s;s of knowing
and &s;erving you. But, amid&s;t all
<PB N="166" REF="170">
the&s;e Applications &s;o full of Ar|dour
and Tenderne&s;s, believe me
Fair Dutche&s;s, there is none who
either in his Pa&s;&s;ion or Submi&s;&s;ion
exceeds him of the River&mdash;
who will be yours for ever, with|out
Re&s;erve or Change, if you
will but Love him.&endq;</P>
</LETTER>
<P>How! I, <HI>&s;aid the Dutche&s;s after
having read the Billet,</HI> I Love Ri|vers;
no, no, they are not for my pur|po&s;e;
I don't like &s;uch Phlegmatick
and Fickle Gallants; I don't Love &s;o
much Coldne&s;s: And be&s;ides this, how
can the&s;e Deities who are always in
motion, talk of Con&s;tancy? They, I
&s;ay, who $nange without intermi&s;&s;ion,
and who run through the whole Earth
with their rapid, and always moving
Currents; they were made for Sea and
River Nymphs, and not for &s;uch real
Terre&s;tial Numphs, &s;uch as I am.
How Madam, <HI>reply'd a certain Gen|tleman
who &s;tood near her,</HI> do you
imagine, that the Deities of the Seas
and Rivers Love only in Imagination?
<PB N="167" REF="171">
Pray be not thus mi&s;taken, but take my
word for it, they u&s;ed not to gra&s;p the
Shadow in&s;tead of the Sub&s;tance; we
will leave the Matter to the Deci&s;ion of
the Duke of <HI>O&mdash;s,</HI> he &s;hall be our
Arbitrator. <HI>The Duke who had cau|&s;ed
the&s;e Billers to be fa&s;tned to the
Hooks, with no other intention than
to ca&s;t them among the Ladies, like
the Apples of Di&s;cord, to &s;ow Di|vi&s;ions
betwixt them, every one of
which flatter'd her &s;elf to meet with
a</HI> Paris, <HI>who would decide in her
behalf, could not forbear Laughing,
to &s;ee what Jealou&s;ie this Piece of
Gallantry had kindled among the
Ladies, who look'd upon the Dutch|e&s;s
as their Common Enemy. This
made the Duke, who had kept at
a di&s;tance from her hitherto, draw
nearer, and tell Madam</HI> de Lile <HI>and</HI>
de Lude <HI>with a Smile:</HI> Well, Fair
Ladies, what is your Opinion of the
Charms of the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;
which make &s;o much noi&s;e on the <HI>Oce|an,</HI>
and have engaged the Hearts of all
the <HI>Rivers?</HI> My Opinion, Sir, is,
<PB N="168" REF="172">
<HI>return'd the fir&s;t with a great deal of
Mode&s;ty,</HI> that &s;he is no le&s;s powerful
on Earth, as on the Water, and that
wherever &s;he comes, &s;he proves dange|rous
to Mens Hearts, and they are &s;ure
to lo&s;e their Liberty. Perhaps, Sir,
<HI>added &s;he Smiling,</HI> yon have made
a trial of it, notwith&s;tanding your u&s;u|al
Indifferency for our Sex. Who can
que&s;tion it, Madam, <HI>reply'd Madam</HI>
de Lude <HI>with an Envious Air,</HI> be|cau&s;e
you di&s;gui&s;e your &s;elf for no other
rea&s;on, than to have a fair opportunity
of declaring to her the tender Senti|ments
&s;he has in&s;pired you with, which,
as it &s;eems, are of a fiery nature. Alas!
it belongs only to the Dutche&s;s of
&mdash;<HI>continued this Lady merri|ly,</HI>
to &s;et Men's Hearts on Fire to
&s;uch a degree, and to lay the whole
World in A&s;hes, before all the Waters
of the Ocean are capable to extingui&s;h
it. Who has told you, Madam, <HI>re|ply'd
the Duke,</HI> that it was on her
Account I took this Di&s;gui&s;e? I know
it, Sir, <HI>&s;aid the Counte&s;s with a pre|tended
Gravity,</HI> by a certain Fore|&s;ight,
<PB N="169" REF="173">
and by the trouble you give your
&s;elf, knowing you to be very backward
in entring the Li&s;t of the Champions of
Love. So, &s;o, Madam, <HI>reply'd the
Duke laughing aloud,</HI> then you think
I am at this time advanced a great
way in the Road of <HI>Venus;</HI> you think
I am come already to that fine &s;mall
Path where we often lo&s;e our &s;elves as
well by Day as by Night, let a Man be
never &s;o expert a Traveller in the Em|pire
of this Godde&s;s. <HI>The Dutche&s;s
who was retired into a private
Room, to write an An&s;wer to the
Letters addre&s;s'd to her, by the Wa|tery
Diety's, returned to the Com|pany,
and told them with a merry
Air, &s;he had found out a lovely</HI>
Triton, <HI>who being the prittye&s;t Lad
in the World, would &s;erve her in
the quality of a Page. Soon after,
the &s;ame</HI> Triton) <HI>who was one of her
Co&s;ins) appeared di&s;gui&s;ed under
the Habit of one of</HI> Neptunes <HI>Sub|j$cts,
and pre&s;ented to the</HI> God of
Jupiter <HI>a Letter neatly folded toge|ther;
<PB N="170" REF="174">
and the Duke going to one
corner of the Room, read the fol|lowing
Lines,</HI></P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>A Letter to the mo&s;t Potent God
of the Seas and Rivers.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;I Am much &s;urprized, great Prince,
how tho&s;e Diety's that are &s;o
redoubtable upon the Waters,
&s;hould Sigh for a Mortal, beyond
who's Power it is to make them a
&s;uitable Return. Doubtle&s;s you
don't call to your Remembrance,
that in the va&s;t extent of your
Kingdoms and in your Palaces,
you are not de&s;titute of Beauties,
a thou&s;and times more engaging
than I am, and con&s;equently much
more capable of inflaming your
Hearts, that do cry continually
among the Caves. What you
mention concerning your Con|&s;tancy,
I can &s;carce imagine it a
Virtue belonging to you, unle&s;s
you appear under the Di&s;gui&s;e of
<PB N="171" REF="175">
&s;ome Watery God or River. You
your &s;elf told me, that the Wa|tery
Deities as well as tho&s;e of
the Heavens, are addicted to
Change, and that <HI>Jupiter,</HI> the God
of Thunder, and the Head of all
the re&s;t, has not been exempted
from this frailty. Farewell, I take
my leave of you, with this Pro|te&s;tation,
that I &s;hall never be in
Love with them, becau&s;e &s;uch
liquid and cold Lovers, are not
very &s;uitable to my reli&s;h.&endq;</P>

<DIV2>
<HEAD>The Dutche&s;s of &hellip;.</HEAD>
<P><HI>The Duke of</HI> O&mdash;s <HI>could not
forbear laughing for &s;ome time, after
the reading of this Letter, not que|&s;tioning
but that the Dutche&s;s, who
was Mi&s;tre&s;s of a great &s;hare of it,
had very well apprehended the
whole My&s;tery of his De&s;ign, which
was to make her believe, if he could,
that he was in Love with her; for
this Lady who had been overcro&s;s'd
<PB N="172" REF="176">
with Lovers, &s;ome &s;incere, others
incon&s;tant, knew by experience how
to di&s;cern a true Lover from a pre|tended
one; &s;o that it was no ea&s;ie
matter to impo&s;e upon her in point
of Love, no more than in any other
Bu&s;ine&s;s of Moment. The Duke
being &s;en&s;ible that his Godde&s;s had
very hand&s;omely upbraided him with
his Boldne&s;s and Incon&s;tancy, by
di&s;gui&s;ing the Stile in the &s;ame man|ner
as he had done before, rejoyn'd
the Company with a merry Coun|tenance,
&s;inging the Fir&s;t words of a
certain</HI> Opera, <HI>which begins thus:</HI>
We are frequently deceived in our
Hopes and Fancies. That is very true
Sir, <HI>reply'd the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;
with much indifferency, and mo&s;t
e&s;pecially in Love Affairs, where
our hopes being built upon</HI> un|&s;teady
Foundations are frequently
&s;ubject to Change. I can't deny that
<HI>&s;aid the Duke of</HI> O&mdash;s <HI>laughing,</HI>
when one thinks one has &hellip;:
Heart in ones own Hand, it often gives
you the &s;lip in &s;pight of all your Care
<PB N="173" REF="177">
and Care&s;&s;es to keep it. What a dread|ful,
what a capricious thing this Love
is, which very rarely &s;uits it&s;elf to our
Inclinations, but &s;uffers us to langui&s;h,
the better to obtain its own ends. I
can't imagine, Sir, <HI>reply'd &s;he with
a &s;mile,</HI> that ever you received any
dangerous Wounds in the Field of <HI>Ve|nus,</HI>
becau&s;e I &s;uppo&s;e you never laid
&s;o near Siege to any Place of &s;trength,
How do you know that, Madam, <HI>&s;aid
the Duke with a forced Complai|&s;ant
Air,</HI> I much doubt it, <HI>reply'd the
Dutche&s;s turning at him, and laugh|ing
as loud as &s;he could,</HI> you are ve|ry
unlucky and malicious, Madam,
<HI>return'd the Duke, throwing him|&s;elf
at her Feet with a mo&s;t pa&s;&s;io|nate
Air,</HI> will you treat me thus in|human
for ever? will you have no
Compa&s;&s;ion upon a God, whom you have
compelled to make his Appearance here
on Earth, to declare to you, that he
Loves you beyond all the Godde&s;&s;es of
his Empire; and that none of his
Beauties of the Watry Element, could
ever touch his Heart as you have done.
<PB N="174" REF="178">
I can't imagine it to be Love, Sir, <HI>&s;aid
the Dutche&s;s, coldly laughing, and
fixing her Eyes on him;</HI> what wou'd
you have me do, cruel I ady, <HI>&s;aid the
Duke of</HI> O&mdash;s <HI>interrupting her,
and &s;etching &s;ome very deep Sighs,
whil&s;t he ki&s;s'd her Hands with
much Tran&s;port,</HI> your pre&s;ent De|portment
&s;eems to be without Di&s;gui&s;e,
and to proceed from a &s;incere Heart,
<HI>added &s;he with an engaging Air,</HI> but
you would doubtle&s;s pa&s;s for the <HI>Phe|nix</HI>
of our Age, could you oblige the
Fair Sex with what they have &s;earch'd
for &s;o long in vain. I mean the <HI>Philo|&s;ophers
Stone.</HI> You meant, <HI>&s;aid the
Duke, turning the Sen&s;e another
way,</HI> &s;uch as have never &s;een or known
it: But take my word for it, Madam,
I will give it you to touch, and make
you &s;en&s;ible of all its Vertues, when it
is apply'd as it ought to be. Sir, <HI>&s;aid
Madam</HI> de Lude, <HI>with a &s;eeming In|nocence,</HI>
is this Stone good for Di&s;ea|&s;es?
O! mo&s;t admirable, good Ma|dam,
<HI>an&s;wered the Duke Laughing,</HI>
but e&s;pecially for Women in a Langui&s;h|ing
<PB N="175" REF="179">
Condition, it has a particular Ver|tue
to open the Ob&s;tructions of the
Spleen, and rejoyce the Heart; nay, it
cures all external and internal Di&s;tem|pers.
What the Duke of <HI>O&mdash;s</HI> is
plea&s;ed to tell you, Madam, is nothing
but the Truth, <HI>&s;aid the Count</HI> de Vi|ronne;
there is not a more Sovereign
Remedy in the World again&s;t Pale Fa|ces
and &hellip; At that rate Count,
<HI>&s;aid the Dutche&s;s of &hellip; je&s;t|ingly,</HI>
this Medicine would be very
proper for one of my Young Ladies,
who is always Langui&s;hing and out of
Order. Put her into my Hands, Ma|dam,
<HI>reply'd the Count Laughing,</HI>
provided &s;he be but Hand&s;ome, I will
promi&s;e to Cure her, and it &s;hall not
co&s;t you a Farthing: I am a Phy&s;itian,
who at fir&s;t &s;ight can dive into the Di|&s;ea&s;es
of a Young Woman, and never
fail in my Cure. Very well, Good
Doctor, <HI>&s;aid this Lady,</HI> provided &s;he
is Hand&s;ome, then &s;he plea&s;es you; but
what if &s;he &s;hould prove not &s;o by
chance, then the poor Creature mu&s;t die
a Martyr without Relief: You are an
<PB N="176" REF="180">
odd &s;ort of a Phy&s;itian, who have no
Remedies but for Young and Hand|&s;ome
Women. I don't know what to
&s;ay to that, Madam, <HI>reply'd the Count
ari&s;ing from his Seat,</HI> but this I know,
that my Art will not go beyond its
Bounds. Pu&s;h on your Knowledge to
the utmo&s;t Point, Count, <HI>&s;aid the
Duke of</HI> O&mdash;s <HI>laughing and clap|ping
him upon the Shoulder,</HI> let us
&s;ee what fine Cures you are like to per|form.
This is my daily Bu&s;ine&s;s, Sir,
this is all my Cure, <HI>reply'd he &s;miling,</HI>
and if I meet with good &s;ucce&s;s, I will
not fail to let you know it, in hopes
you will congratulate my good Fortune.
I judge you will have a care of that,
<HI>reply'd the Duke merrily,</HI> &s;uch Phy|&s;itians
as you, are &s;eldom fond of a
Confident, or of a third Per&s;on when
they perform their Operations, or are
making &s;ome plea&s;ing Compo&s;ition for
the Ladies. <HI>Mon&s;ieur</HI> de Turenne,
<HI>and the Prince</HI> de Conde, <HI>who had
been talking very &s;eriou&s;ly in one of
the Green Walks, concerning Mat|ters
of State, then coming into the
<PB N="177" REF="181">
Apartment where the Company was,
made the Conver&s;ation &s;oon run up|on
the Affairs of War, and &s;ome o|ther
Concerns of Moment, whil&s;t
the Duke of</HI> O&mdash;s <HI>and tho&s;e that
had attended him laid by the Di&s;|gui&s;e,
after which they diverted
them&s;elves with walking in a Mea|dow
covered with Flowers, in the
mid&s;t whereof was a very curious
Spring, unto which Madam</HI> de Lude
<HI>gave the Name of</HI> N$rci&s;&s;us, <HI>becau&s;e
&s;he ob&s;erved the Count</HI> de Vironne
<HI>bu&s;ie in looking into and admiring
his Beauty in an adjacent Brook,
which had its ri&s;e from thence. The
Dutche&s;s of</HI> Nemours, <HI>who was not
unacquainted with the Count's Amo|rous
Inquietudes, who was indulg|ing
his Splenetick Thoughts, joyn'd
her agreeable Voice with the melo|diou&s;ne&s;s
of the Birds, under &s;ome
Trees, and Sung the following
Words:</HI></P>
<Q><PB N="178" REF="182">
<L>Whence proceeds this Extremity of
my Misfortunes?</L>
<L>My Heart is not &s;atisfy'd with
whatever I do:</L>
<L>Oh! Little <HI>Cupid,</HI> who once was the
Object of my Scorn,</L>
<L>Are not the&s;e Misfortunes the Ef|fects
of thy Revenge?</L></Q>
<P>No, Madam, <HI>&s;aid the Count</HI> de
Vironne <HI>acco&s;ting her,</HI> my Complaints
are founded upon another Motive, Love
has not as yet triumph'd over my Heart
nor &s;ubdued my Strength. Then you
are very happy, Sir, <HI>cry'd the Dutche&s;s
with a Sigh,</HI> among all the Pa&s;&s;ions
unto which Mankind are &s;ubject to,
none is &s;o dreadful and powerful as
Love; even its Plea&s;ures have an in|termixture
of Cruelty; not with&s;tanding
which, they are the chief Objects of all
our Wi&s;hes, and all other Plea&s;ures,
without the&s;e, make but a &s;lender Im|pre&s;&s;ion.
Don't di&s;&s;emble the Matter,
<HI>continued &s;he Laughing,</HI> were not
the&s;e Sighs I heard you &s;end forth near
<PB N="179" REF="183">
the Banks of this Brook, the effects of
a tender Pa&s;&s;ion? And I know very
well, that Charming Per&s;on to whom
they were directed: But perhaps, you
are afraid, as indeed it is natural to all
Tender Hearts to be, that even the
&s;tronge&s;t Tyes and Knots may be worn
out in time, and that even the mo&s;t A|morous
Heart that can be, may recover
its Tranquility or change for a new
Pa&s;&s;ion. <HI>The Count was ju&s;t going
to make a &s;uitable return to the
Dutche&s;s, when the Company com|ing
up with them, they &s;aw them|&s;elves
obliged to break off this Con|ver&s;ation,
and Night beginning to
draw near, every one prepared for
their return home.</HI></P>
<P>The Dutche&s;s of&mdash;who
had no inclination to be pre&s;ent at
this Fea&s;t upon the Water, becau&s;e
&s;he intended to be&s;tow the&s;e precious
Hours in the Duke's Ab&s;ence, in en|tertaining
the Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI> who
did not leave her for one moment
all that while; in retaliation of
which, &s;he told him all the mo&s;t
<PB N="180" REF="184">
Tender and mo&s;t Pa&s;&s;ionate Things
in the World, as that &s;he loved him,
if it were po&s;&s;ible, even beyond her
own &s;elf, that &s;he had never loved
any thing like him in all her Life:
The Count returning the&s;e Demon|&s;trations
of Tenderne&s;s with the mo&s;t
Gallant Expre&s;&s;ions that can be con|ceived,
the&s;e two Lovers, full of
Content, enjoy'd all the Happine&s;s
&s;o uncommon a Love as theirs, is
of, when they heard the Duke of
<HI>O&mdash;s</HI> was come. You may gue&s;s
at their Di&s;quiet, when they found
them&s;elves thus di&s;turbed in the
mid&s;t of their Plea&s;ures, the Count
being then at the Feet of his Ado|rable
Dutche&s;s. This made him fetch
a very deep Sigh, and then ari&s;ing
from the Ground, he made all the
ha&s;te he could to get away (accord|ing
to the Dutche&s;&s;es Directions) by
a pair of private Back Stairs, belie|ving
that the Door had been open;
but as ill Fortune would have it, the
Duke of <HI>O&mdash;s</HI> having taken the
Key along with him, was ju&s;t then
<PB N="181" REF="185">
coming up the Stairs, with an Inten|tion
to come unawares upon the
Dutche&s;s, whom he &s;uppo&s;ed to be
alone. The Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI> who
knew his Steps, had no other way
left him, than to go back to the
Dutche&s;s of&mdash;Apartment,
which &s;he had Lock'd, being gone
into another Room, as not doubt|ing,
but that he was got away &s;afe
enough; &s;o that the poor Count,
&s;eeing not the lea&s;t Opportunity to
conceal him&s;elf, leap'd out of the
Window into a Gallery, and &s;o run
away as fa&s;t as Lightning, wrapt up
in his Cloak: In this Po&s;ture, he
pa&s;s'd &s;everal Centinels, who know|ing
him by &s;ight, and gue&s;&s;ing, tho'
at a di&s;tance, at the matter, let him
e&s;cape undi&s;turbed. The Duke
of&mdash;who had heard &s;ome
noi&s;e on the top of the Stair-ca&s;e,

&s;earch every corner thereabouts, and
calling for Candles, as they were
brought up, and looking upon the
<PB N="182" REF="186">
Stairs, whether &s;ome Trouble&s;ome
Spirit had not taken up his Re&s;idence
there, the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;Pi|cture
was found there enclo&s;ed in an
Enamell'd Ca&s;e with the Count's
Name in Cyphers above it, be&s;ides
a mo&s;t Pa&s;&s;ionate <HI>Billet deux,</HI> the
Dutche&s;s had &s;ent him that Morn|ing;
and which the Count, dread|ing
the Duke's Pre&s;ence no le&s;s than
a Burnt Child does the Fire, had
dropt, together with the Picture, as
he was running away. As good
Fortune would have it, this Precious
Jewel happened to fall into the
Hands of one of the Dutche&s;s of
&mdash;Ladies, who had the Wit
to hide it, as &s;oon as &s;he found it.
One of the Duke of <HI>O&mdash;s</HI> Gentle|men
&s;eeing her put it up in her
Pocket, urged her much to let him
&s;ee what good thing &s;he had met
with, but &s;he remembring that it
mu&s;t belong to the Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI>
who had been all that Day with the
Dutche&s;s, would not grant his Re|que&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="187">
<HI>The Duke of&mdash;was no &s;oon|er
a little appea&s;ed, and the noi&s;e
over, but this Young Woman, who
was very tru&s;ty to the Dutche&s;s, ha|ving
look'd upon the Picture, and
finding who&s;e it was, went to the
Lady's Apartment, and told her with
a Smile;</HI> Madam, you can't imagine
how ill an Humour the Duke is in
to Night; I believe he fancies he is
haunted with Vi&s;ions, he has &s;earch'd
every corner in this part of the Palace;
and had it not been for me, he had
found upon the little Back Stairs, a
Picture-ca&s;e, belonging to the Count <HI>de
Guiche,</HI> which he lo&s;t as he was going
away. Alas! what do you tell me, <HI>re|ply'd
the Dutche&s;s blu&s;hing;</HI> poor
Count, has he dropt the Ca&s;e wherein he
put my Picture with &s;o much care?
Pray who has found it? Madam, <HI>re|ply'd
the Young Lady Smiling,</HI> I
gue&s;s 'tis in the Hands of a Per&s;on,
where Fortune thought fit to put it.
Perhaps in yours, my Dear, <HI>reply'd
the Dutche&s;s looking in her Face.</HI>
Yes, Madam, thanks to Heaven, Chance
<PB N="184" REF="188">
would order it &s;o, <HI>return'd &s;he pre|&s;enting
it to her.</HI> 'Tis certain, Ma|demoi&s;elle,
<HI>&s;aid the Dutche&s;s,</HI> the
Duke is of a very odd Temper, his Jea|lou&s;ie
and Mi&s;tru&s;t will never leave
him, till he goes to the Grave; what
could come in his Head to make him
come up by this pair of Stairs to my
Apartment, and to rai&s;e &s;uch a di&s;tur|bance
there; but after all I can't for|bear
Laughing, when I con&s;ider what
a Fright he put the poor Count in, who
no more than my &s;elf expected his com|ing
home &s;o early; O how heartily he
vexes by this time, when he mi&s;&s;es his
Picture-ca&s;e out of his Pocket. No
doubt on't, Madam, <HI>reply'd the young
Lady,</HI> we are often much concerned for
things of le&s;s Value, and this is of the
greate&s;t con&s;equence to him; for &s;ince
you had &s;o much Goodne&s;s as to be&s;tow
your Picture upon him, it mu&s;t needs
be very dear and precious to him. I
could wi&s;h my &s;elf at this time, my
Dear, <HI>reply'd the Dutche&s;s of</HI>&mdash;
to be the &s;ame Picture the Duke fancied
was upon the Stairs, that &s;o I might be
<PB N="185" REF="189">
a Witne&s;s of his Inquietude and Vexa|tion;
what pretty Names, I warrant
you, he gives to him&s;elf, how he calls
his De&s;tiny &V;nfortunate, how often he
accu&s;es his Ill Fortune with being dull,
blind, without di&s;cretion, and I know
not what all, becau&s;e, for&s;ooth, &s;he would
treat him at that rate? I dur&s;t &s;ay,
never was a Man as he thinks at this
time, born under &s;o malignant a Pla|net,
which makes every thing he under|takes
to turn to his Destruction. The&s;e
extravagant and hyperbolical Expre&s;&s;i|ons,
Madam, <HI>&s;aid Mrs.</HI> Mantales
<HI>Laughing,</HI> are frequent among Courti|ers,
and Pa&s;&s;ionate Lovers, who are &s;ure
to magnify every thing at lea&s;t by one
half. They never feel any indifferent
Pains, nor &s;light Puni&s;hments; in the
Empire of Hearts, the Men &s;eldom
&s;hed any Tears in any le&s;&s;er Quantity
than what would make us a good hand|&s;ome

and his Mi&s;eries, his infallible Fate is
at hand, that he mu&s;t die a Martyr

very cruel and inhuman Nature, to
be in&s;en&s;ible and without Pity for a
Lover in De&s;pair.</HI> The&s;e are the dai|ly
Offerings the&s;e Gentlemen regale us
withal, were we but Fools enough to
believe what they &s;ay, their Sighs would

frankly tell you, <HI>continued &s;he,</HI> that
nothing vexes me more, than when I &s;ee
&s;ome of your Sex thus cajoled away by
the&s;e Grimaces of a Gallant: I wi&s;h to

who delighted extreamly in the
Company of this young Woman,
who had a great deal of Wit, and
was highly beloved by her Mi&s;tre&s;s,
could not forbear Laughing, and
told her,</HI> At that rate, my Dear, you
would be very cruel to your Lovers;
they would be very &V;nfortunate, and
not very long liv'd under &s;o Rigorous
a Government as yours. Madam, <HI>re|ply'd
&s;he with a plea&s;ing Air,</HI> I ne|ver
had many Adorers, but &s;uch as
De&s;tiny &s;ent in my way, I took care to
make them &s;en&s;ible, that nothing is
actually Charming, unle&s;s it be dearly
bought; a Rigorous and fierce Deport|ment
are infinitely becoming a Woman,
e&s;pecially if they are Aimable and
Charming: 'Tis one of the mo&s;t com|mendable
and mo&s;t peculiar Ingredients
to keep their Gallants; I think nothing
more ea&s;ier in the World, than for a
Woman to get a whole Tribe of Sigh|ing
Admirers, but 'tis a difficult Task,
<PB N="188" REF="192">
'tis a Rarity to keep them for any time.
The&s;e are the chief Qualities of Gal|lants,
in like Trifles they be&s;tow their
Talent, <HI>&s;aid the Dutche&s;s Smiling,</HI>
but after all, don't you believe, that
one Sex as well as the other, are tired
out with tho&s;e old worn out Sighs, they
have been pe&s;ter'd with for many Years
together, and which being nothing but
Repetitions of the &s;ame thing, make no
further Impre&s;&s;ion upon us. You know
there is but one God of Love in the
World, who infu&s;es his Sentiments,
which are unalterable and not to be re|new'd;
whence it is, that old Lovers
have always the &s;ame Notions, and

Actions, which are exceeding delight|ful.</P>
<P><HI>The Dutche&s;s of&mdash;had

to Supper; &s;o &s;oon as he &s;aw
<PB N="189" REF="193">
her, he went to meet her, and con|ducting
her to the Table,</HI> Where was
you, Madam, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> about an Hour
ago, I look'd for you in your own
Lodging Room, in hopes to &s;urprize
you, and to give you an account of my
Di&s;gui&s;ement, and what plea&s;ure I took
in putting upon the Ladies. Sir, <HI>re|ply'd
the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;cold+ly,</HI>
I was then in my little Clo&s;et at
Prayers, reflecting upon the Vanity of
the World, and was not a little &s;ur|pri&s;ed,
when I heard a dreadful noi&s;e
in my Chamber, you are &s;o often trou|bled
with the&s;e Fancies, that I can't
for my Life gue&s;s at the rea&s;on of it;
I &s;uppo&s;e you think I have a certain
Spectre there, I keep in my own Pay.
'Tis mo&s;t certain, Madam, <HI>reply'd the
Duke not without &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> that
I heard a noi&s;e in your Room, and upon
the Stairs as I was coming up, but could
not find out who it was that made it;
but one of your Young Women, who was
one of tho&s;e that &s;earch'd every corner
among the re&s;t, can witne&s;s it: For
my part, Madam, <HI>added the Duke
<PB N="191" REF="194">
Laughing,</HI> I am apt to believe, that
the Spectre you ju&s;t now &s;poke of, has
his Re&s;idence there in your Ab|&s;ence.
Perhaps it may be &s;o, Sir,
<HI>reply'd the Dutche&s;s with a fierce
Countenance,</HI> you had be&s;t put &s;ome
Centinels thereabouts to catch it if you
can; but it is no ea&s;ie matter to find
out a Spirit that appears no where, ex|cept
in our Imagination. You take me
for a Fanta&s;tical Man, Madam, <HI>re|ply'd
the Duke laughing;</HI> you are
addicted that way I am afraid, Sir,
<HI>&s;aid the Dutche&s;s with a &s;mile,</HI> be|cau&s;e
when ever you have been abroad
upon your Diver&s;ions, you always fancy
upon your return home, to &s;ee &s;ome|thing
in your way. The&s;e, Madam,
are the Remnants, <HI>reply'd the Duke
very obligingly,</HI> of the plea&s;ant Ideas
I conceive in the Company of my Friends,
which don't leave me &s;o &s;oon, but fol|lowing
me where ever I go, cau&s;e the&s;e
Chimerical Vi&s;ions in my Brain. Be
that as it will, <HI>reply'd &s;he with much
indifferency,</HI> the&s;e Fancies are not ve|ry
becoming a Per&s;on of your Rank in
<PB N="190" REF="195">
the World; if you will take my word
for it, I would bani&s;h the&s;e Notions
out of my Thoughts; I will do it Ma|dam,
becau&s;e you de&s;ire it, <HI>reply'd the
Duke laughing,</HI> in hopes to oblige you
for ever. That is well, Sir, <HI>&s;aid the
Dutche&s;s interrupting him, &s;itting
down at Table, and eating her Sup|per,
without &s;carce &s;peaking one
word. Supper being over, each of
them went to their Apartments,
where they &s;pent part of the Night
in recollecting the Adventures of the
Day. The Duke thought of no|thing
el&s;e but his Di&s;gui&s;e, and the
Dutche&s;s of what Inquietudes the
Count</HI> de Guiche <HI>in all probability
labour'd under, for having lo&s;t his
Picture and Ca&s;e &s;he had pre&s;ented
him with. The next Day in the
Morning, this Lover full of Impa|tience,
pay'd her a Vi&s;it</HI> incognito,
<HI>whil&s;t &s;he was yet in Bed; where he
kneel'd upon the Ground with all
the Marks of a mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate Sub|mi&s;&s;ion.
The Dutche&s;s of&mdash;
who always bore a &s;hare in his Af|fections,
<PB N="192" REF="196">
when &s;he &s;aw him in that
Po&s;ture, offer'd him her Snow white
Hand, and told him with a charm|ing
Air,</HI> ari&s;e Count, I can't &s;ee you
thus, come &s;eat your &s;elf in that Elbow
Chair ju&s;t by the Bed. Mo&s;t Incom|parable
Lady, <HI>reply'd he, fa&s;tning his
Mouth to her fair Hands with an
exce&s;s of Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> permit me to enjoy
for &s;ome Minutes longer, the plea&s;ure
I feel in this Po&s;ture, which is beyond
my Power to expre&s;s at this time. What
then is it you have to? tell me, dear
Count, <HI>reply'd &s;he with a tender and
engaging Air?</HI> What I would &s;ay,
Madam, <HI>reply'd he &s;ighing;</HI> alas!
I lo&s;t ye&s;terday as I went from you,
that precious Pledge of your Love you
were plea&s;ed to be&s;tow upon me; but I
know not what lucky thought fore|tells
me, I &s;hall once more &s;ee this
charming Piece again. Your Stars
Count, <HI>an&s;wered the Dutche&s;s of
&mdash;with a&s;&s;urance,</HI> has deceiv'd
you, for I have not &s;een the things you
look for; and what is it you have lo&s;t,
that &s;o nearly afflicts and vexes you:
<PB N="193" REF="197">
O! Madam, you know it well, <HI>cry'd
he looking &s;teadfa&s;t on her,</HI> 'tis
what I value beyond any thing el&s;e in
the World, pray re&s;tore it to me, if you
would have me live for a few Hours
longer. If your Life depends on a
Picture-ca&s;e, poor Langui&s;hing Man,
<HI>&s;aid the Dutche&s;s merrily,</HI> come take
it, but be more careful of it another
time. Mrs. <HI>Montalet</HI> found it upon
the Back Stairs, and had it not been
for her, the Duke, who you know is of|ten
a hunting of Spirits, becau&s;e you
are like them, had certainly found it:
Con&s;ider what Troubles and Vexations
you would have occa&s;ioned me, if &s;uch
a Misfortune had befal'n us? 'Tis
very true, Madam, <HI>&s;aid the Count
with an engaging Air,</HI> but if you did
but know, how I dread the Duke of
&mdash;Pre&s;ence, nay, even when I
do but hear him coming, I actually
forget my &s;elf. I know not who or where
I am, and therefore have the greater
Obligations to the Lovely <HI>Finote,</HI> who
has already more than once delivered me
from &s;uch like Dangers. I have given
<PB N="194" REF="198">
her the right Name; and am glad I
hit it &s;o well.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Montalet,</HI> who had heard e|very
word the Count &s;aid of her,
came running on a &s;udden into the
Dutche&s;s of&mdash;Chamber; <HI>I
have another Opportunity of &s;erving
you, Count,</HI> cry'd &s;he, <HI>hide your &s;elf
in this By-place, el&s;e you will certainly
be catch'd by his Highne&s;s.</HI> So the
Count went into the Place the young
Lady &s;hew'd him, where they u&s;ed
to keep &s;ome of their Gla&s;&s;es and
Bottles. The Duke no &s;ooner came
into the Room, but &s;eeing a <HI>China</HI>
Orange lying upon her Table, he
cut it, and was going to throw the
Peel into that place where the Count
was, it being near the Chimney;
but the young Lady perceiving his
Intention, drawing near him with a
&s;ingular Dexterity; <HI>Pray, Sir,</HI> &s;aid
&s;he Laughing, <HI>give it me, I love it
extreamly, it is mo&s;t excellent for the
Stomach.</HI> The Duke, who little
dream'd of the Count's being in
that place &s;o early in the Morning,
<PB N="195" REF="199">
willingly gave it her. <HI>I thank you,
Sir,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Montalet,</HI> making a pro|found
Reverence, and ca$ing it with
all the pretended Eagerne&s;s in the

is,</HI> added &s;he. <HI>E&s;pecially,</HI> &s;aid the
Dutche&s;s Loughing, <HI>when it comes
from the Duke. Very true, Madam,</HI>
reply'd &s;he very obligingly, <HI>I am apt
to believe, that its delicious $word$ is
owing to him, becau&s;e he has eat of it.
You have a mind to make your &s;elf
merry, you charming pretty Eyes, I
&s;hall take Revenge of your Complai&s;ance.
O! Sir, I hope,</HI> reply'd the young
Woman mode&s;tly, <HI>your Revenge will
keep within the bounds of Moderation,
and do me no hurt, I can't promi&s;e
you that, my Dear,</HI> &s;aid the Dutche&s;s
interrupting and looking at her, <HI>the
Duke is more dangerous than you think
for; &s;ometimes a &s;mall matter troubles

you in the Night time he would certain|ly
take you for a Spectre or for a

in the lea&s;t wonder, that Men leave
their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, no more than I do
at their abandoning their Gallants:
A new Pa&s;&s;ion contains the true Re|l$&s;h
of Love: How many engaging
and tender Diver&s;ions does it not
carry along with it? Whereas Old
and Langui&s;hing Sighs, and thread|bare
Addre&s;&s;es, are only tire&s;ome
and Vexatious. The&s;e were the
Dutche&s;&s;es Thoughts upon this Sto|ry,
which perhaps you may &s;ee her
put in practice in good time.</P>
<P>Now let us Enquire what is be|come
of the Duke of&mdash;who,
we told you, had been relating his
Comical Adventures to the Marchio|ne&s;s
<PB N="201" REF="205">
of <HI>Monte&s;pan.</HI> This Lady &s;ee|ing
the Duke to per&s;i&s;t in his Addre&s;|&s;es
to her, frankly own'd that &s;he
Lov'd him, and to keep her Heart
only for him, had rejected the Of|fers
made her by &s;everal Eminent
Lords. <HI>I believe it, Madam,</HI> an|&s;wered
the Duke Laughing&punc; <HI>even not
excepting my little Cou&s;in the Count</HI> de
Lau&s;un, <HI>who is quite &s;poil'd, becau&s;e
the King allows him &s;o much freedom;
I am &s;en&s;ible he does not want Wit nor
Gallantry, and may compare in that
point with any of the King's Favou|rites;
but after all, the King loving
him to &s;uch a degree, makes him too
bold. O$ Sir,</HI> &s;aid the Marchione&s;s
with a Serious Air, <HI>did you but know
with what de$$$erity he can ma|nage
our Monarch, you would &s;tand
amazed at it: Fir&s;t, he is his Con|fident,
who knows how to repre&s;ent to
him all the great Heroick Qualifica|tions
of</HI> De la Valiere, <HI>and that in
the fine&s;t Colours in the World, and
thus in&s;inuates him&s;e$f into his Confi|dence;
the&s;e are the Artifices the Fa|vourites
<PB N="102" REF="206">
make u&s;e of, to bring the King
ab&s;olutely over to his Intere&s;t. I will
tell you &s;incerely, Madam,</HI> reply'd
the Duke, <HI>that my Cou&s;in</HI> de Mon|pen&s;ier
<HI>is very fond of him, and this
is another Rea&s;on, why he &s;tands &s;o
fair in the King's Book, becau&s;e &s;he
takes all Opportunities of extolling
&s;ometimes his Wit, &s;ometimes his Per|&s;on
before him, &s;o that the&s;e continual
Prai&s;es coming from the Mouth of &s;uch
a Per&s;on as &s;he, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for his
Maje&s;ty to forbear having a great E|&s;teem
for him; and what you mentio|ned
ju&s;t now, &s;tand him in no &s;mall
&s;tead to pre&s;erve the King's good Opi|nion
for him, becau&s;e he honours with
his E&s;teem and Good Will, all tho&s;e
that have either a &s;incere or pretended
Inclination for Mademoi&s;elle</HI> de Va|lieres,
<HI>and he is &s;o far prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd
with the powerful Charms of this young
Lady, that he can di&s;cern Fal&s;hoods
from Truth in that point. That is true
enough, Sir,</HI> reply'd Madam <HI>Monte|&s;pan</HI>
Laughing, <HI>but it is not her hand|&s;ome
Body that Enchants the King;
<PB N="103" REF="207">
the Count</HI> de Lau&s;une <HI>is a better Judge,
and has a much nicer Reli&s;h, than to
know better; but to &s;peak the Truth,
when he &s;peaks in her prai&s;e he is obliged
to make u&s;e of all his Dexterity and
feign'd Complai&s;ance,</HI> continued &s;he
with a jealous and m$licious Smile,
<HI>his Aim reaches a great way be$ond of|fering
his Incen&s;es to our Gallant Mo|narch's
Beauty. However, this very
Beauty, Madam,</HI> &s;ay you what you
plea&s;e of her, continued the Duke
with a merry A$r, <HI>has a certain</HI> je ne
&s;cay quoy, <HI>which Charms and Enga|ges
this Prince to &s;o high a degree;
and whether it be in her Body or Mind,
he di&s;covers in her &s;omething beyond
what he meets with in other $adies.
It mu&s;t be in her Body then, Sir,</HI> re|ply'd
the Marchione&s;s Laughing,
<HI>that Nature has plac'd this extraordi|nary</HI>
Je ne &s;cay quoy; <HI>for were it in
her Mind, this would not &s;atisfie the
Amorous King, for in Love, the Bo|dy
bears a greater &s;hare than the Mind,
unle&s;s we have only an Imagination.
What you &s;ay, Madam, is agreeable to
<PB N="204" REF="208">
Rea&s;on, your Thoughts are very agree|able
to Truth,</HI> &s;aid the Duke inter|rupting
her with a Smile, <HI>but I am
very ready to leave his Maje&s;ty in the
quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his unknown God|de&s;s,
and his</HI> Je ne &s;cay quoy, <HI>which
Nature perhaps has fram'd on purpo&s;e
for his Plea&s;ure: For my part, all my
Thoughts are taken up with yours, which
&s;trikes with &s;o high a Lu&s;tre into my
Heart and Eyes: Pray then tell me,
whether I have no Rival, and whether
your Heart is not divided? No, no,
dear Sir,</HI> cry'd &s;he with a Tender
Air, <HI>don't fear any thing of that kind,
I Love no Body but your &s;elf; and I
don't be&s;tow my</HI> Je ne &s;cay quoy <HI>upon
any Body living unle&s;s &hellip;.
and tho', Sir, you are plea&s;ed to &s;ay,</HI>
It &s;hines in your Eyes, <HI>it lies hid|den,
and is hard to come at. Incompa|rable
Lady,</HI> reply'd the Duke coldly,
<HI>did the Count</HI> de Lau&s;un <HI>never find,
nor come at it, who &s;earches into the
mo&s;t dark and difficult places, and en|ters
the &s;traite&s;t and &s;malle&s;t Pa&s;&s;ages,
without much oppo&s;ition, as he him&s;elf
<PB N="205" REF="209">
will often tell us when he has a Gla&s;s
or two of Wine in his Head.</HI> The
Marchione&s;s Blu&s;h'd at the&s;e words
believing no otherwi&s;e than that the
Count had made his Brags of her
Favours to the Duke, which he,
who ob&s;erv'd every Motion, &s;oon
taking notice of, told her with a
Smile; <HI>Madam, I find your Heart be|trays
you, and that the Count</HI> de Lau|&s;un,
<HI>with his piercing Eyes has found
out the way to that</HI> Je ne &s;cay quoy,
<HI>&s;o many Philo&s;ophers have &s;earch'd af|ter
in vain: How, could you be&s;tow
your Favours upon &s;o incon&s;tant a
Per&s;on as he is? Certainly this is
to be to prodigal of tho&s;e Charms Na|ture
has be&s;tow'd upon you with &s;o
much Liberality. And why do you be|lieve,
Sir,</HI> reply'd Madam <HI>de Monte&s;pan</HI>
with a fierce Air, <HI>I have be&s;tow'd my
Favours upon the Count</HI> de Lau&s;un? <HI>I
mu&s;t have little el&s;e to do, to &s;pend my
time with the mo&s;t fickle and mo&s;t in|con&s;tant
of all Men living: For tho'
he is in the ab&s;olute po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of</HI> Made|moi&s;elle'<HI>s
Favour, he has an almo&s;t
<PB N="106" REF="210">
infinite Number of Mi&s;tre&s;&s;$s be&s;ides,
whom he cajoles into his Snare, by his
deceitful Language: At this time when
he has an Intrigue with a</HI> Coun&s;ellor's
Wife, <HI>for a few Days perhaps, and the
next Week, doubtle&s;s he will be for a
fre&s;h one; &s;o that one mu&s;t be half mad
and bereaved of Common Sen&s;e, to have
a Man of &s;o odd a Character. To tell
you the Truth,</HI> &s;aid the Duke, <HI>I think
him the happie&s;t Man on Earth; he is
not &s;en&s;ible of tho&s;e Pains in his Love
Intrigues, which are the con&s;tant At|tendants
of a well &s;ettled and con&s;tant
Love, nor tho&s;e Inquietudes which
torment a true Lover. Do you call
that Love, Sir,</HI> &s;aid the Marchio|ne&s;s
with a &s;eeming Surprize? I
<HI>&s;hould not much care to be beloved at
that rate; and I would rather chu&s;e to
be without a Gallant as long as I Live,
than have one of that Kidney. What
Qualities then mu&s;t a Man be Ma&s;ter
of, Madam,</HI> reply'd the Duke draw|ing
nearer to her, <HI>to be beloved by you,
and to plea&s;e you con&s;tantly. Sir,</HI> cry'd
&s;he, <HI>Felicity, Tenderne&s;s, Sincerity, a
<PB N="107" REF="211">
nice Pa&s;&s;ion without &s;elf Intere&s;t, and
in &s;hort, every thing that makes up a
perfect and accompli&s;h'd Gallant. Where
my Dear,</HI> reply'd the Duke with a
pa&s;&s;ionate Air, <HI>where did ever you &s;ee
the Original of this beautiful Picture?
Don't you know that the defects you
&s;ee in us, are like the &s;hades which &s;et
off and embelli&s;h our Merits, and that
if there were no Charms at all in Love,
its Plea&s;ures would &s;oon fade and lo&s;e
their reli&s;h. Is this your real Opinion
then of your chargeable Sex,</HI> added the
Marchione&s;s with much Gravity, <HI>is
Incon&s;tancy your Talent, go and try
whether you can meet with &s;ome body
el&s;e that is fond of your frailties, which
you extol for a Virtue: For my part,
my Heart &s;hall rather be without a Pa&s;|&s;ion,
as long as it endures, than to &s;hew
you the lea&s;t Countenance; &s;o that we
have forfeited all your good Opinion,
Madam,</HI> cry'd the Duke with a court|ly
Air, <HI>'tis high time to reconcile you
to our Sex, lea&s;t you &s;hould conceive
a hatred again&s;t us: What an unfor|tunate
Accident would that prove to
<PB N="208" REF="212">
me,</HI> continued he, <HI>if you &s;hould hate
me, to me, who loves you beyond my
own Life, and who have often told you
&s;o, if you will own the Truth. I am
very doubtful, Sir,</HI> reply'd Madam <HI>de
Monte&s;pan</HI> with much indifferency,
<HI>what to think of it, Great Men are no
le&s;s Politick and Incon&s;tant in Love
than other People; you have &s;aid the
&s;ame thing to the Counte&s;s</HI> d' Olone,
<HI>who at this very time exclaims again&s;t
your Incon&s;tancy and &s;udden Change,
and &s;o do &s;everal other hand&s;ome La|dies.
I don't think fit to name for Mo|de&s;ty's
&s;ake, and for fear of doing them
a Prejudice. Your Frankne&s;s and Re|&s;ervedne&s;s,
Madam,</HI> reply'd the Duke
with much Gravity, <HI>are highly Com|mendable,
but you &s;hould &s;et bounds to
them, and not take me for &s;o &s;ickle
and incon&s;tant a Per&s;on. I am &s;en|&s;ible
what you have told Madam</HI> d' O|lone
<HI>upon that head, who is a fooli&s;h
indi&s;creet Per&s;on, whom I &s;carce &s;hould
have as much as named to you, had not
you begun the Di&s;cour&s;e; I de&s;ire you
to believe, I make a va&s;t Difference
<PB N="209" REF="213">
betwixt you and her.</HI> He had no
&s;ooner &s;aid the&s;e words, but (being
a Per&s;on who is very captious) he
took his Leave very coldly, which
not a little &s;urpri&s;ed the Marchio|ne&s;s,
who intended not to have
parted with him at &s;o ea&s;ie a rate,
nor to be &s;atisfy'd with words,
which are not the only thing Ladies
of her Temper expect from their
Gallants. However, the Count <HI>de
Lau&s;un,</HI> again&s;t who's incon&s;tant and
Fickle Humour &s;he had exclaimed &s;o
much but a few Moments before,
took care to repair the lo&s;s &s;he had
&s;uffered by the Duke of&mdash;
Ab&s;ence, and freely pre&s;ented her
with what it perhaps was not in the
others power to give. The Count
pa&s;s'd the Evening with her in all man|ner
of Diver&s;ions the time and place
could afford him and this Lady, who
is as fickle and changeable as any
Man well can be, could not forbear
railing at the Count again&s;t the
Duke, telling him, he would be a
Child as long as he lived, and never
<PB N="110" REF="214">
come to an Age capable of &s;triking
up a good Bargain with a fair Lady,
when &s;he offered him the be&s;t thing
that belonged to Her. <HI>Madam,</HI> ad|ded
the Count laughing, <HI>there is as
much difference betwixt the King's
Galantry, and that of the Duke of
O&mdash;s, as there is betwixt the Sun
and an ordinary Star; Every Action
of this Great Monarch, in Relation to
the fair Sex is charming, and rai&s;es
an Emulation in others; whereas on the
contrary, the Duke of O&mdash;s has no|thing
in his way of Court&s;hip (which
ought to have &s;omething of Vivacity and
Briskne&s;s in it) but what favours Dul|ne&s;s
and Langui&s;hment. 'Tis very true
what you &s;ay, Sir,</HI> reply'd the Mar|chione&s;s
with a &s;mile, <HI>he has &s;pent
above two whole hours in asking me
whether I loved him, and whether he
had any Rivals, be&s;ides a thou&s;and
quibbles concerning a certain</HI> Jene&s;cay
quoy, <HI>which I believe he was afraid
he &s;hould not find out, unle&s;s one was
to &s;hew him the way to it. What &s;ig|nifies
trifling away ones time at that
<PB N="111" REF="215">
rate when a Man propo&s;es to make &s;ure
of a Womans Heart; all th$&s;e del$ys
&s;erve only to co$l our Pa&s;&s;ions&punc; and to
check the de&s;igns of a Lover. Accord|ing
to the rules I &s;hould give to a
Soldier in the Wars of</HI> Venus, con|tinued
&s;he laughing, <HI>be ought to At|tack
the Place he intends to t$ke with
the utmo&s;t fury, and not to rai&s;e the
Siege till it has &s;urrendred upon good
Terms. I believe, Madam, no Ge|neral
in</HI> Europe, &s;aid the Count
<HI>de Lau&s;un</HI> with a mo&s;t gallant Air,
<HI>could have given a better &hellip; to
his Soldiers than you have done,</HI> viz.
<HI>to Attack a Place with the utmo&s;t Vi|gour,
and not to &s;tir from before it till
it &s;urrenders upon very good Conditi|ons:
This is as much as the be&s;t Ge|neral
could do, for we know that the
greate&s;t Captains have &s;ometimes been
lo&s;t during the heat of an Engagement.
The Wounds we receive in the
Battles of Love,</HI> reply'd &s;he merrily,
<HI>are &s;eldom &s;o dangerous as to prove in|curable;
that God who protects them
always, takes care of his Subjects, and
<PB N="212" REF="216">
furthers the taking of the Place; &s;ome|times
we get the Victory, and remain
Masters of the Field of Battel before
we are aware of it, and obtain the Gar|land
Love has prepared for us. Ma|dam,</HI>
reply'd the Count laughing a|loud,
<HI>you have a very pretty way of
convincing and reviving the Courage of
&s;uch Volunteers, as are inclined to li&s;t
them&s;elves under the Standard of the
God of Love; &s;uch plea&s;ing hopes and
promi&s;es, are &s;ufficient to rou&s;e the
Courage even of a Coward, and to make
him out brave danger with Sword in
hand, even with the utmo&s;t hazard of
his Life. O! Count, you will ea&s;ily
lo&s;e your &s;elf there,</HI> &s;aid &s;he with a
malicious &s;mile, <HI>you will take care of
it I'll warrant you for &s;ome time longer.
I de&s;ire it &s;hould be &s;o,</HI> continued he,
<HI>that I may love you the longer and
&hellip;. Madam</HI> de Monte&s;pan.
Then ari&s;ing from her Seat, after
having obliged the Count with a
ki&s;s, began to Sing certain Words
out of a certain Opera &s;he had been

<P>The Count <HI>de Lau&s;un,</HI> well &s;a|tisfy'd
to have &s;o exactly hit the
Critical Minute with this Lady, em|brac'd
her at parting, and the next
Morning went to make Love at the
Feet of <HI>Mademoi&s;elle,</HI> who was not
a little Jealous of his other Mi&s;tre&s;|&s;es,

<P>The Duke of <HI>O</HI>&mdash;<HI>s,</HI> who was
very ea&s;ily put out of Humour, and
had lett the Marchione&s;s of <HI>Monte|&s;pan,</HI>
as we told you, in a very ab|rupt
manner, did not pay her a Vi|&s;it
for &s;ome time after, looking for
his Diverti&s;ements in Playing, and
in the Company of &s;ome of his Flat|terers,
who to in&s;inuate them&s;elves
into his Favour, left nothing unat|tempted

to create a new Jealou&s;ie in

The&s;e In&s;inuations prevail'd &s;o far
upon the Duke, that he not only
&s;et certain Per&s;ons to watch all her
Motions, but al&s;o became &s;o for|getful
of his high Rank and Extra|ction,
as to bend all his Thoughts to
Revenge, whereof the poor Count

out of the Chappel without &s;peak|ing

Friend, mu&s;t I part with thee for ever?
Don't be &s;o much afflicted,</HI> an&s;wered
the Marquis giving him a Ki&s;s, <HI>I will
endeavour by the Acce&s;&s;ion of my
Friends, to make your Peace in your
Ab&s;ence, which perhaps may be of no
$ong Continuance. Would it plea&s;e
Heaven,</HI> reply'd he &s;queezing his
Hand, <HI>you may &s;peak true, and prove
<PB N="219" REF="223">
$ good Prophet, how happy &s;hould I be
$f you</HI> &hellip;. Some more Com|pany
coming in, the&s;e two Friends

<P>The Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI> who had
taken his leave of his Father before
he went to his Friend, after having
&s;pent a few Minutes in ruminating
upon his Misfortune, re&s;olved not
to depart without &s;eeing the Dutch|e&s;s
of&mdash;to effect which, he
ventured upon a thing which no Bo|dy
but what was as Amorous as him|&s;elf
would have undertaken. He
knew the Dutche&s;s to have a great
E&s;teem for a certain <HI>Religio&s;o,</HI> who
&s;ometimes u&s;ed to come to her:
The Count having di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf
under his Habit, went without any
more Ceremony to the Palace, where
in the height of his Misfortune he
had the Satisfaction of entertaining
his dear Dutche&s;s for a con&s;iderable
time, and to tell her at length, every
thing a Man is capable of &s;aying,
or feeling, when he is to be &s;epara|ted
<PB N="220" REF="224">
from what he Loves. <HI>Is it po&s;|&s;ible,
my dear Count,</HI> &s;aid &s;he embra|cing
him very tenderly, <HI>I &s;hould ne|ver
&s;ee you again? Alas!</HI> continued
&s;he with a Charming Voice, <HI>your
Acquaintance will co&s;t me abundance of
Tears; and 'twill be very hard for me
to outlive, alas, that touches me to the
Quick. O! Madam,</HI> reply'd the
Count <HI>de Guiche</HI> throwing him&s;elf
at her Feet, <HI>how much do I &s;tand in|debted
to your Goodne&s;s, &s;ince you are
plea&s;ed to withdraw from me &s;o preci|ous
a Gift as your Love at the la&s;t mo|ment?
But after all this,</HI> added he,
&s;hedding &s;ome Tears he was no
longer able to retain, <HI>I am at the
Point of lo&s;ing the mo&s;t Agreeable and
mo&s;t Charming Happine&s;s of my Life;
which for the future will be indifferent
to me without</HI> &hellip;. The poor
Count, at the&s;e la&s;t words, found
him&s;elf &s;o far overwhelm'd with his
Afflictions, that he fell into a
Swoon at the Dutche&s;s's Feet, who
ordered Mrs. <HI>Montalet</HI> to throw &s;ome
fair Water in his Face, whil&s;t &s;he
<PB N="221" REF="225">
rubb'd his Temples and Hands with
&s;ome <HI>Hungary Water.</HI> This la&s;t Re|medy
proved the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful,
becau&s;e the Dutche&s;s her &s;elf had
apply'd it, and there is not a more
Sovereign Medicine in the World to
recover a Lover fallen into a Love
Fit, than the Fair Hand of his Mi|&s;tre&s;s,
which 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for him
to re&s;i&s;t, unle&s;s he be actually
dead.</P>
<P>The Count being recovered out
of his Swoon, fix'd his Eyes full of
Langui&s;hment, and a deadly Melan|choly,
on the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;
but continued for a con&s;iderable
time longer without &s;peaking one
word: His Sighs, which on this oc|ca&s;ion
were the faithful Interpreters
of his afflicted Heart, delivered
them&s;elves with much more El$|quence
in this Dumb Language, than
the mo&s;t Polite Expre&s;&s;ions in the
World could have. At la&s;t the
Dutche&s;s, tired with &s;o long a &s;i|lence,
told him with a mo&s;t Pa&s;&s;io|nate
Air, <HI>Lovely Count, have you lo&s;t
<PB N="222" REF="226">
the u&s;e of your Tongue? What makes you
&s;ilent at this Juncture when you &s;hould
make u&s;e of all your Strength to a&s;&s;ure
me of your Heart's being mine for ever,
and to comfort me for your Ab&s;ence,
by giving me a&s;&s;ured hopes, that you will
never forget me. I am &s;en&s;ible,</HI> con|tinued
&s;he &s;queezing his Hands, <HI>that
h$avy Afflictions are dumb, and that
little ones make a much greater noi&s;e:
O! mo&s;t Divine Dutche&s;s,</HI> cry'd the
Count quite tran&s;ported, with Eyes
full of Langui&s;hment, <HI>then you will
Love me after I am gone? What good
Fortune is there like mine in the mid&s;t
of my mo&s;t Cruel Exilement? O mo&s;t
rigorous Fate, who &s;natcheth me, in
&s;pight of all my re&s;i&s;tance, from the
Feet of my Adorable Queen, and which
for ever deprives me of tho&s;e dear and
&s;weet Moments I u&s;ed to enjoy with
her: My Life will be odious to me,
&s;o &s;oon as I &s;ee my &s;elf ab&s;ented from
you, and 'tis po&s;&s;ible time will efface me
out of your Remembrance; a Remem|brance
mo&s;t charming and precious,
if I may be &s;o happy, as to keep a place
<PB N="223" REF="227">
there for ever. Can you doubt, Count,</HI>
reply'd the Dutche&s;s in a mo&s;t ten|der
and engaging manner, <HI>but th$t I
&s;hall continue to Love you after once
having known you &s;o well? O! 'tis
a hard Task, my Dear,</HI> added &s;he, <HI>to
withdraw ones Heart, after it is once
in your Power; one may try the utmo&s;t
of ones Strength in vain to recover it,
$et it will remain the Conqueror and
triumph over it. In &s;pite of my De|&s;tiny,
which will not permit me to &s;ee
you any more, I &s;hall always bear an
implacable Hatred to all tho&s;e that have
betray'd you, and been the occa&s;ion of
your Exilement: Re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that if
ever it is in my Power to render you
more Fortunate, I will omit nothing
that may contribute towards it; and
that I never can forgive the King and
&s;everal other Lords, who have given
and procured this cruel Command. Ma|dam,</HI>
an&s;wered the Count &s;ighing,
<HI>you are &s;en&s;ible 'tis a con&s;iderable time,
&s;ince I fore&s;aw this Misfortune, and
that I told my &s;elf I was not born for
the Enjoyment of &s;o exce&s;&s;ive a Happi|ne&s;s;
<PB N="224" REF="228">
Envy could not look without a
Malicious Eye upon me, and has &s;pit
out all his Rage and Venom again&s;t
even the mo&s;t Innocent Actions of my
Life, in order to render me odious to
the Duke of&mdash;who ever &s;ince
hates me,</HI> as he told my Father the
Mar&s;hal <HI>de Grammont, no otherwi&s;e,
than if I were the greate&s;t Villain on
Earth. The mo&s;t violent Reprimands
my Father</HI> (exa&s;perated again&s;t me
pa&s;t all Reconciliation) <HI>gave me, were
like &s;o many Stroaks that pierced to my
Heart; and I prote&s;t to you, I could
have wi&s;h'd rather to die on the Spot,
than to be forced to &s;ubmit to &s;o har&s;h
a Treatment: How, &s;encele&s;s, ambiti|ous
Wreth,</HI> &s;aid he tran&s;ported with
Rage, <HI>how dur&s;t thou have the Impu|dence
to lift up thy Eyes to a Per&s;on
of &s;o high a Rank in the World? I
thought it my be&s;t way to return him
no An&s;wer, knowing my &s;elf guilty of
having rai&s;ed my Thoughts too high.
But pardon, mo&s;t Divine Dutche&s;s,</HI>
continued this Pa&s;&s;ionate Lover ki&s;|&s;ing
her Hands, <HI>pardon the Ambition
<PB N="225" REF="229">
of a &s;econd</HI> Jeanes <HI>who&s;e Wings were
melted becau&s;e he came too near the
piercing Beams of the Sun,</HI> &s;aid the
Dutche&s;s, interrupting him with
a Smile, becau&s;e &s;he began to
be tired, to &s;ee the Count in &s;o
Langui&s;hing a State, without mak|ing
the lea&s;t Motion of giving her
her la&s;t Farewel. Truly never did
a Man appear in a wor&s;e condition,
to act like a Man, than the poor
Count did upon this Occa&s;ion. I
can't tell whether his Religious Ha|bit,
or the apprehen&s;ion of parting
with his Mi&s;tre&s;s, had extingui&s;h'd
in him that Natural Heat, which
mo&s;t Gentlemen are &s;en&s;ible of when
they are in Love with a Fair Lady;
but certain it is, that his Incompa|rable
Godde&s;s, &s;eeing him in &s;uch a
Condition, which very much de&s;er|ved
her Pity and Compa&s;&s;ion, told
him more than once, he &s;hould thru&s;t
his good Fortune as foreward as he
could, and that &s;he would take care
to &s;upport it as long as &s;he could;
unto which I &s;uppo&s;e the poor
<PB N="226" REF="230">
Count return'd no An&s;wer, at lea&s;t
not as far as ever I could learn. At
la&s;t the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;taking
no great Satisfaction in his Dying
Conver&s;ation, gave him leave to de|part,
telling him at parting, and
looking at him with a mo&s;t Com|pa&s;&s;ionate
Air, that &s;he would for|give
his &s;mall Faults both of the
Body and Mind, and that &s;he would
Love him neverthele&s;s, tho he had
been wanting in his &hellip;..
and in a thou&s;and other things re|quired
from a true Lover. The
Count ready to run di&s;tracted, be|cau&s;e
he had no &s;ooner apprehended
the Dutche&s;s's meaning, began now
to feel &s;ome certain Motions of Ac|knowledgment,
&s;uch as the Fle&s;h
mo&s;t commonly in&s;pires into all A|morous
Hearts, and would fain have
pu&s;h'd on the Conver&s;ation to a more
&s;en&s;ible Point, but that the Dutch|e&s;s,
who began to be tired with his
Sighs and Tears, told him with a
&s;eeming endearing Air; <HI>Don't &s;tay,
Count, go, go, I am &s;atisfy'd with your
<PB N="227" REF="231">
Pa&s;&s;ion; take care of your &s;elf, and&punc;
rely upon every thing I have promi&s;ed
to you; be gone without any further
delay, lea&s;t you &s;hould be catch'd here
by the Duke, and then your Ca&s;e would
be more deplorable than ever.</HI></P>
<P>Within a Minute after the Count
was gone, the Duke of&mdash;paid
a Vi&s;it to the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;
in her Bed Chamber, having not
&s;poken one word to her ever &s;ince
he left her the la&s;t time at Ma&s;s,
and the Dutche&s;s, who was vex'd
to the Soul, whereof &s;he knew the
Duke to be the chief Occa&s;ion, gave
him but a cold Reception, pretend|ing
&s;he intended to retire into her
Clo&s;et, to avoid his Company: But
the Duke who was extreamly fond
of her, &s;eating him&s;elf near her,
and looking at her, <HI>what have I done
to you, Madam,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>which de|&s;erves
your hatred, you &s;hun me as if
I were your Enemy. You are not un|acquainted
with it, Sir,</HI> reply'd the
Dutche&s;s abruptly, <HI>I am &s;urprized
how you can ask me &s;uch a que&s;tion.
<PB N="228" REF="232">
$f it is the Count</HI> de Guiche'<HI>s Ab&s;ence,
Madam,</HI> reply'd the Duke &s;miling,
<HI>that puts you into &s;o ill a humour, and
makes you &s;o aver&s;e to my Care&s;&s;es, I
will rather chu&s;e to make him come
back co&s;t it what it will; but what do
I &s;ay,</HI> added the Duke checking
him&s;elf, <HI>perhaps he is not gone yet.
You know that better than I,</HI> &s;aid the
Dutche&s;s with a great deal of indif|rency,
<HI>I don't que&s;tion but he has rea|dily
obey'd your Orders in every thing.</HI>
The Duke, who as often as he &s;aw
the Dutche&s;s, found her in a mo&s;t
&s;erious and pen&s;ive Po&s;ture, and who
had flatter'd him&s;elf, that after the
Counts Bani&s;hment from her &s;ight,
&s;he would &s;hew more fondne&s;s to
him; when he found him&s;elf mi&s;ta|ken
in his hopes, he fell into a very
deep Melancholy, which continued
for a con&s;iderable time, nothing be|ing
able to divert him, becau&s;e he
ob&s;erved the Dutche&s;s's Indifferency
increas'd almo&s;t every Day. 'Tis
certain, &s;ince the Count <HI>de Guiche</HI>'s
Exilement, &s;he never &s;hew'd any real
<PB N="229" REF="233">
Tenderne&s;s to the Duke, whom &s;he
did not Love very much before:
But this la&s;t Action having touch'd
her to the Heart indeed, &s;he con|ceived
a &s;ecret hatred again&s;t the
Duke and the whole court, tho &s;he
did all &s;he could to conceal it. How|ever,
at la&s;t, as time wears out the
Remembrance of every thing, and
that even the greate&s;t Pa&s;&s;ions don't
continue for ever, the Dutche&s;s be|gan
to forget the Tender Addre&s;&s;es
of the Count, and the Duke by de|grees
accu&s;tom'd him&s;elf to di&s;pence
with her Indifferency.</P>
<P><HI>One Day the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;
being alone with the Dutche&s;s</HI> de
Crequi <HI>(a Lady &s;he loved extreamly,
and whom &s;he made the Confident
of her Amorous Secrets)</HI> St Cloudi,
<HI>&s;he began to talk to her concerning
him;</HI> 'tis certain, <HI>&s;aid &s;he with a
Langui&s;hing Voice,</HI> that all Men are
Incon&s;tant and addicted to Change, I
have not heard one word of the Count
<HI>de Guiche</HI> &s;ince his Departure: O!
ungrateful Man, <HI>continued &s;he &s;igh|ing,</HI>
<PB N="230" REF="234">
he has got &s;ome other Intrigues
upon his Hands; what is become of all
the Oaths his Treacherous Heart has
offer'd up to me, never to forget me,
after what I had done for him. Ma|dam,
<HI>reply'd the Dutche&s;s</HI> de Crequi,
'tis po&s;&s;ible he dares not venture to
write to you under his pre&s;ent unfortu|nate
Circum&s;tances; you are in je&s;t I
believe, <HI>an&s;wered the Dutehe&s;s of
&mdash;Laughing,</HI> as if this were
the fir&s;t time he has run &s;uch a hazard?
Be&s;ides all this, Love knows how to
&s;urmount all ob&s;tacles, and to open it|&s;elf
an ea&s;ie way, if &s;upported by a real
Tenderne&s;s: But let us talk of him no
more, come we had better divert our
&s;elves with your fair Cardinal; pray
let us know how matters &s;tand betwixt
you and him, and whether you conti|nue
to be con&s;tant to him; to tell you
the truth, <HI>continued &s;he laughing,</HI>
I look upon the Cardinal as a very gal|lant
Prelate, and the mo&s;t charming
Per&s;on in the World; for he has a
way to accommodate every thiug to the
Will of Heaven, and his Precepts of
<PB N="231" REF="235">
Morality are very ea&s;ie, would but all
the re&s;t of the &s;ame Profe&s;&s;ion follow
his Foot&s;teps, the Mona&s;teries and the
Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks would not appear &s;o odious
to the World as now they do: And
don't you believe, Madam, <HI>&s;aid the
Dutche&s;s</HI> de Crequi <HI>with a plea&s;ant
Air,</HI> that mo&s;t of our Religious Men,
'tho never &s;o re&s;erved and au&s;tere in
outward Appearance, frame them&s;elves
Moral Rules &s;uitable to their own In|clinations,
and reli&s;h the &s;en&s;ual Plea|&s;ures
at the &s;ame time when they pre|tend
to pray for the poor Sinners. De|votion
is the be&s;t Cloak in the World
whrewith to hide their Gallantry's. I
know one who always will not give his
Ab&s;olution to a young Penitent, unle&s;s
&s;he be&s;tows beforehand her Favours upon
him, which are di&s;counted when he
gives her his Benediction, which, as
you may ea&s;ily gue&s;s, mu&s;t needs be ve|ry
Holy. But my dear, <HI>&s;aid the
Dutche&s;s of&mdash;interrupting
her with a &s;mile,</HI> in what manner does
your lovely Cardinal impart his Bene|dictions
to you, when he &s;tays whole
<PB N="232" REF="236">
Days with you to perform his Devo|tions.
O! Madam, <HI>cry'd the Dut|che&s;s</HI>
de Crequi <HI>with a &s;eeming bi|gotted
and pious Air,</HI> one may &s;ay he
is an Angel when he is in private with
one, the Charms of his Conver&s;ation are
beyond Expre&s;&s;ion, and very benefi|cial.
I did believe as much, <HI>&s;aid the
Dutche&s;s of&mdash;Laughing,</HI> but e&s;|pecially
when this good natur'd Legate
offers &s;ome Vows at the Feet of &s;ome
Female Saint, and prays her to be fa|vourable
and propititious to him in his
De&s;igns; I am apt to imagine there
are very few of the&s;e good Souls, who
are capable of refu&s;ing the Incence of|fered
to them by &s;o Holy a Man, and
of not Leaning to his Prayers with
plea&s;ure, that would be no le&s;s than to
commit an unpardonable Crime. To
confe&s;s the Truth, Madam, <HI>&s;aid the
Dutche&s;s</HI> de Crequi, without je&s;ting,
that con&s;idering his uncommon Deport|ment
in all his Actions, 'tis a very
hard Tryal, not to give ear and be|lieve
him in every thing he &s;ays; I
don't believe, that among all the Cardi|nals,
<PB N="233" REF="237">
there is one who is &s;o Aimable

well acquainted with him, before you
can rightly known him. My Dear, <HI>re|ply'd
the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;with

the Cardinal's Picture like an Accom|pli&s;h'd

How Fortunate you are to meet with &s;o
many Charms and Merits centred in
one Man; their Sex is mo&s;t common|ly
no more than a Compo&s;ition of Pride
and Di&s;&s;imulation, &s;ubject to continual
Change, and in whom you dare not put
much confidence. I am very &s;en&s;ible
of that Madam, <HI>return'd the Dutch|e&s;s
of</HI> Crequi <HI>&s;ighing,</HI> but I can a&s;&s;ure
you, tho&s;e Faults you &s;peak of don't
belong to our Legate, it may be &s;aid of
him, that he is the <HI>Phenix</HI> among
Men, being the only one in his kind.
Then make the be&s;t, <HI>reply'd the
Dutche&s;s of</HI>&mdash;of the&s;e incom|parable

<HI>reply'd the Dutche&s;s</HI> de Crequi <HI>mer|rily;</HI>
the place where he takes his re&s;t,
and where we put him, is kept very
clo&s;e, and the Entrance to it is very

he will continue there for a great while.

they were coming back, they &s;aw at
a di&s;tance, &s;ome Hor&s;emen and

of &s;everal Princes and Prince&s;&s;es, who
were come from Court &s;ooner than
ordinary, to &s;urpri&s;e the Dutche&s;s

in&s;upportable to me in my Exile|ment,

it upon an Unfortunate Man, who
has Sacrificed every thing to plea&s;e

which will never cea&s;e to be yours.
O Heavens! who are Witne&s;&s;es of
what Pains I undergo, Can any
Martyrdom be comparable to mine,
being deprived of the Object that
&s;et my Heart on Fire; that mo&s;t
dreadful Death would be prefer|able
to tho&s;e in&s;upportable Inqui|etudes,
which I feel both Day and
Night; I fear lea&s;t, (but perhaps
<PB N="238" REF="242">
without rea&s;on) my mo&s;t Adora|ble
Dutche&s;s &s;hould have forgot
and bani&s;h'd me from her Remem|brance;
alas! this would prove
the fini&s;hing Stroak to put a Peri|od
to my Life, which I linger out
for &s;ome time, but will &s;oon be
lo&s;t, unle&s;s you &s;upport it, <HI>Madam,</HI>
by &s;ome agreeable Hopes which
will &s;till receive its Native Vigour.
Pray don't refu&s;e to give &s;ome
Con&s;olation to the mo&s;t Langui&s;h|ing

who would think my &s;elf above
every thing that may be call'd
Great and Sublime, could he be
once more &s;o Fortunate at one time

at your Feet, that nothing but
Death was capable to efface you

<HEAD>The Count de&hellip;.</HEAD>
<P>Now the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;was
by this time &s;ufficiently inclined
<PB N="239" REF="243">
to forget the Count, &s;eeing every
day a World of new Admirers at
her Feet; &s;he was neverthele&s;s very
well plea&s;ed when &s;he peru&s;ed his
Letter, out of a piece of Vanity Na|tural
to all Women, who when they
are to lo&s;e their Lovers; nay, tho
they are not very fond of their Gal|lants,
they are always very Ambiti|ous
of having a great number of
Admirers, and love to keep them as
long as they can. This was, as I
&s;uppo&s;e, the true Motive which in|duced
the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;to
be plea&s;ed with the Count <HI>de Gui|che</HI>'s
Letter; perhaps they might be
&s;lender Remnants of kindne&s;s &s;he

as it will, &s;he &s;eem'd to be very well
&s;atisfy'd with the Letter, nay, &s;he
ki&s;s'd and read it over &s;everal times,
and upon enquiry that &s;he might
&s;afely entru&s;t the Bearer thereof
with an An&s;wer, &s;he went into her

<HEAD>The Dutche&s;s of&mdash;Letter, to the
Count de Guiche.</HEAD>
<OPENER>My Dear Count,</OPENER>
<P>&startq;TO tell you true, I did believe
you had forgot me for ever;
but now am convinced I was in
the wrong, and that I have been
unju&s;t to call in que&s;tion the Fide|lity
of a Heart you pre&s;erve, as you
&s;ay, entirely for me. I &s;uffer a
thou&s;and Mortal Inquietudes &s;ince
you have been ab&s;ent, a thing that
touches me to the Heart, and I do
all that lies in my Power to make
your Peace at Court. I de&s;ire you
<HI>Count,</HI> to re&s;t &s;atisfy'd of my good
Intentions for you, and of my de|&s;ire
of &s;eeing you once more in my
Life. The Duke of&mdash;and
all the re&s;t, whom I don't think
fit to name, have had their full
&s;hare of Vexation, by my Indiffe|rency
towards them; I know it is
a Sin not to forgive our Neigh|bour,
<PB N="241" REF="245">
and that it is a Precept of
Chri&s;tian Morality we ought mo&s;t
of all to put in practi&s;e; but I
know not how to bring my &s;elf to
do it; I am not able to bani&s;h
from my Heart, the hatred I have
conceived again&s;t the&s;e Enemies of
my Repo&s;e and Satisfaction. Fare|wel,
<HI>dear Count,</HI> be &s;atisfy'd that I
have always been very Affectionate
to your Intere&s;t, and to every thing
that concerns you &hellip;.&endq;</P>
</LETTER>
<P>I give you leave to gue&s;s at the
Count <HI>de Guiche</HI>'s Satisfaction, when
he received the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;
Letter, which revived him as it were
from the Dead, according to the u|&s;ual
Style of Lovers, and once more
rai&s;ed his drooping hopes, which at
certain Intervals, were reduced to a
very low condition. Never did a
Man appear &s;o well contented in the
mid&s;t of his Pain; his only delight
u&s;ed to entertain his Melancholy
Thoughts in &s;ome Solitary Woods,
<PB N="242" REF="246">
and now he pitch'd upon the &s;ame
place, and &s;pent &s;everal days &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively
in reli&s;hing the Plea&s;ures of
his Love in his Imaginations, and
to recal to his Mind tho&s;e happy
Moments he had enjoy'd at the
Feet of his Dutche&s;s. The&s;e were
the daily Occupations of the Count
in his Exilement. But let us leave
him to his Imaginary Enjoyments,
and &s;ee whether the Dutche&s;s of
&mdash;did in the mean while take
&s;ome more real Plea&s;ures, &s;uch as
were more proper to give Satisfacti|on
to her Sen&s;es. The Dutche&s;s of
&mdash;&s;eeing her &s;elf without a
Love Intrigue, &s;oon re&s;olved to en|ter
upon another Engagement of
that nature; for the God of Love,
who is more Jealous of his Glory
than any other Deity, thought it not
for his Intere&s;t, to let &s;o Fair a
Conque&s;t &s;lip out of his Hands, to
the great Detriment of his Empire;
the Lord <HI>Grave,</HI> and the Count <HI>de
Lude,</HI> did not &s;igh long in vain at
her Feet, but met with a favourable
<PB N="243" REF="247">
Reception at her Hands, in &s;pite of
all the Duke's Envy and Jealou&s;ie,
which almo&s;t exceeded the Bounds
of Rea&s;on; but being tired with the
Dutche&s;s's Indifferency, he amu&s;ed
him&s;elf with his Coque$$$es among
the Ladies, making his Addre&s;&s;es to
all that would but accept of them.
One day the Duke being more A|morous
than commonly he u&s;ed to
be, and entertaining the Barone&s;s of
&mdash;he had a great Inclination in
the fir&s;t heat of his Pa&s;&s;ion, to a|&s;cend
the Hill of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> and
vi&s;it the dwelling place of the Mu|&s;es:
But this Lady, who had a great
many Gallants, who took up all her
time, and &s;eldom fail'd to attend
her, would not &s;uffer the Duke of
<HI>O</HI>&mdash;<HI>s</HI> to get footing in her Domi|nions;
whereat he being entirely
di&s;&s;atisfy'd, made him re&s;olve to
take up once more with the Coun|te&s;s
<HI>d'Olone.</HI> This Lady being at that
time not over crowded with Gal|lants,
was then lying upon a Green
Bank in a carele&s;s Nightdre&s;s; the
<PB N="244" REF="248">
Duke entring the Garden without
much Ceremony, and taking her by
the Chin, found it wet all over; <HI>O!
Madam,</HI> &s;aid he to her withdrawing
his Hand, <HI>who was it, that has water|ed
your Grounds, it is overflowed eve|ry
where, I intended to have planted
&s;omething there, but find it impractica|ble?
Let not that hinder you, Sir,</HI>
reply'd &s;he with a langui&s;hing Look,
<HI>from pur&s;uing your De&s;igns, we will
take care to drain it, and make it fit
to cheri&s;h the Plant you intend to plant
there.</HI> The Duke of <HI>O</HI>&mdash;<HI>s,</HI> who&s;e
Inclinations were check'd by this
Accident, thought it his be&s;t way to
defer the Bu&s;ine&s;s to another more
convenient time, leaving the Ground
to be Cultivated by the Count <HI>de</HI>
&mdash;who was an excellent Gardi|ner,
and who knew the Art of plea|&s;ing
her Lady&s;hip, who was the Mi|&s;tre&s;s
of it. The Duke of <HI>O</HI>&mdash;<HI>s</HI>
had no &s;ooner left the Counte&s;s, but
he return'd to his Palace, di&s;tracted
with variety of Thoughts, where
he gave an account of his whole
<PB N="245" REF="249">
ventures to the Prince <HI>de Conde,</HI> who
came to pay him a Vi&s;it; <HI>Did you
but know, dear Cou&s;in,</HI> &s;aid he with
his u&s;ual Ingenuity, <HI>how far I was
di&s;gu&s;ted at the Impudence of this Wo|man,
which put &s;uch a Check upon me,
that it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to come
near her; you would &s;tand amazed at
it. O!</HI> cry'd he with a Scornful
<HI>Look,</HI> how nau&s;eous is the Female Sex,
and how impotent are their Charms,
when once they have bid farewel to Mo|de&s;ty
and Moderation, and have not
the power to refu&s;e a good Turn. How,
Cou&s;in, would you have a Woman &s;tand
it out to the la&s;t Extremity in an A|morous
<HI>Siege,</HI> reply'd the Prince <HI>de
Conde,</HI> Laughing as loud as he cou'd,
<HI>certainly you are of a different Opini|on
from mo&s;t People, who look upon
tho&s;e that are pretty pliable as the mo&s;t
Aimable and mo&s;t Engaging. I don't
under&s;tand that,</HI> return'd the Duke
of <HI>O</HI>&mdash;<HI>s</HI> Smiling, <HI>I like a little
Oppo&s;ition, when I make my Addre&s;&s;es
to a Lady, methinks it makes Love re|li&s;h
the better: There is &s;omething in
<PB N="246" REF="250">
what you &s;ay, Sir, but there is a con&s;i|de$able
difference betwixt the beginning
and the end of a thing,</HI> reply'd the
Prince Laughing, <HI>in point of Gallan|try;
&s;o &s;oon as a Lady has let the
Mou&s;e dig a hole in the Chee&s;e, all
Di&s;&s;imulation and Compliments are
out of Sea&s;on: Vpon &s;uch Occa&s;ions as
th$&s;e I would have them follow the
Advice of my Female Acquaintance,
who &s;eeing two Lovers that had a Ten|derne&s;s
for one another, care&s;&s;ing toge|ther
without coming to the Point, What
makes you thus trifle away your Time,</HI>
&s;aid &s;he, <HI>&s;ince your Love is reciprocal.</HI>
The Duke, who is always &s;tarting
Difficulties, and very irre&s;olute in
every thing, did &s;till perfi&s;t in his
Opinion in oppo&s;ition to the Prince
<HI>de Conde,</HI> till at la&s;t they parted.</P>
<P>The la&s;t having a mind to divert
him&s;elf with one of his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es at
the Duke's co&s;t, told her the Subject
of their Conver&s;ation, and this La|dy
having not Di&s;cretion enough to
keep it to her &s;elf, communicated it
to &s;ome others of their Acquain|tance,
<PB N="247" REF="251">
till at la&s;t it came to the
Duke's Ear, who ever &s;ince concei|ved
a Grudge again&s;t the Prince <HI>de
Conde;</HI> and he being naturally of
an unequal and fickle Temper, he
likewi&s;e broke off with &s;ome of his
Friends, who Laugh'd in private at
his Folly. Some Months after, the
Duke, capricious even in his Devo|tions,
made a new Vow to a certain
Saint he had made choice of, among
all the re&s;t of the&s;e happy Intelli|gences;
him he cho&s;e for his Patron,
and kept pretty con&s;tant to him for
a con&s;iderable time, if we may gue&s;s
at it by the va&s;t number of Prayers
addre&s;s'd to him; whereof we
thought fit to in&s;ert one, which
happened to fall into our Hands, a|mong
&s;ome other Memoirs of the
Duke of <HI>O&mdash;s</HI>'s Life, written
with his own Hand.</P>

<HEAD>A Pr$yer to St. Remy, the Martyr.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;GReat Saint, who illuminates to
the highe&s;t Degree, the Re|bellious
and Vicious Eyes of the
Fle&s;h, pre&s;erve my Soul, thro' thy
Goodne&s;s and Sufferings, from the
Temptations of the Devil, and the
piercing Sting of Sin, which com|municates
its Poi&s;on to us poor
Mortals, and &s;preads within us a
Poy&s;onous Scent, de&s;tructive to our
Salvation: This Mercy I hope for
from you, good Saint, who&s;e Com|pa&s;&s;ion
is infinitely beyond all
Bounds; not one of your Brother
Saints has hitherto been plea&s;ed to
give Ear to my Prayers, in &s;uch a
manner as I could have wi&s;h'd it,
either for Power or Good Will:
This has made me often change
my Patron, after having thrown
away upon them, abundance of In|cen&s;e,
which I heartily repent of
&s;ometimes: But as for you who
<PB N="249" REF="253">
are the Favourite of Heaven and
Angels, and beloved by the whole
Spiritual and Ble&s;&s;ed Ho&s;t, I don't
in the lea&s;t doubt, but that you
will hearken to my Prayers, and
fill my Heart with Satisfaction and
Joy.&endq; <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>By this well fram'd Prayer you
may &s;ee, that the Duke of <HI>O&mdash;s</HI>
takes abundance of care of the Wel|fare
and Tranquility of his Soul, the
greate&s;t Happine&s;s a Man can enjoy.
The Catholick Religion teaches us,
that we mu&s;t obtain Paradi&s;e by
good Works, and that without them
there is no Salvation; this makes
him &s;ometimes tell his Intimate
Friends, that to forbear going into
the Wars, is a Charitable Action,
for fear you &s;hould kill one of your
own Kind, and this is his Rea&s;on,
why he does not appear at the head
of any of his Maje&s;ty's Armies; fir&s;t
of all, for fear of being kill'd him|&s;elf,
which is Self-Murther, according
<PB N="250" REF="254">
to St. <HI>Remy</HI>'s Doctrine, who expre&s;|ly
forbids it; and &s;econdly, for fear
he &s;hould kill any Body el&s;e. The&s;e
are the &s;pecious Rea&s;ons which
has made the Duke of <HI>O&mdash;s</HI> lead
an Idle Life, and be u&s;ele&s;s to the
State. But to return to the Vow
he had made to his beloved Saint.
A few Days after the Conclu&s;ion of
<HI>Lent,</HI> our Duke, to make him&s;elf a|mends
for &s;everal Weeks Devotion,
went abroad a Fi&s;hing for divers
Days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, dre&s;s'd up like an
Apo&s;tle, in Company of &s;ome of his
Brethren, who wore a loo&s;e Gown,
as well as him&s;elf, and a Leather
Girdle, with many Knots in it, by
way of Penance. The&s;e Fi&s;hermen
row'd in &s;everal Boats upon the
<HI>Seine,</HI> &s;ome with Fi&s;hing Rods, o|thers
with Ca&s;ting Nets; After they
had for a con&s;iderable time row'd up
and down in the River, by good
chance they catch'd abundance of
Fi&s;h of all &s;orts in the Net, to the
great &s;atisfaction of the Duke of
<HI>O&mdash;s,</HI> the Founder of the Fea&s;t.
<PB N="251" REF="255">
He return'd his unfeigned Thanks a
thou&s;and times to St. <HI>Remy,</HI> and ki&s;|&s;ed,
in the Pre&s;ence of his Brethren,
his little Image he wore in his Hat
as well as they did, making a mo&s;t
&s;incere promi&s;e to him, as <HI>Lewis</HI> XI.
did, who wore the Image of our
Lady in Lead, on the foremo&s;t part
of his Crown, that he would always
remember him as long as he lived.
The Fea&s;t being ended, each of the&s;e
Di&s;ciples return'd to his own home,
in his Apo&s;tles Garb. The Dutche&s;s
of&mdash;&s;eeing the Duke enter the
Palace under this Di&s;gui&s;e (&s;he be|ing
a Lady of a Merry Di&s;po&s;ition)
could not forbear Laughing hearti|ly,
which the Duke full of his Zeal
perceiving, took very ill, and with
a Look of Indifferency, told her;
<HI>Madam, you pay but little Re&s;pect to
tho&s;e that imitate the Saints: Do you
know that this loo&s;e Gown has a Ver|tue
of curing &s;everal Di&s;tempers, and
keep us from Sinning. Then I don't
wonder, Sir, that you wear it,</HI> reply'd
the Dutche&s;s Laughing more hearti|ly
<PB N="252" REF="256">
than &s;he did before, <HI>you that dread
&s;o much the Temptations of the Fle&s;h,
and a Habit of &s;inning in that kind,
and this I &s;uppo&s;e is the rea&s;on that
makes you change your Inclinations and
Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es &s;o often. 'Tis true, Madam,</HI>
an&s;wered the Duke in a milder Tone,
and with a Smile, <HI>If I were to fol|low
the Advice of my Father Confe&s;&s;or,
I mu&s;t be obliged to change oftner &s;till,
than I do: The Good Father is &s;o nice
and &s;evere again&s;t cu&s;tomary Sins, that
at his rate, one mu&s;t have a new one
every Month, or every Week. Truly,</HI>
reply'd the Dutche&s;s Laughing a|loud,
<HI>the&s;e Charitable Le&s;&s;ons of the
Religious Father, are enough to make
Men incon&s;tant, if tho&s;e that are guil|ty
of that frailty of Loving the Fair
Sex, are either &s;incere or Fools enough
to let them know every thing they do,
or think. At that rate, Madam,</HI> re|ply'd
the Duke with an angry Coun|tenance,
<HI>you call Auricular Confe&s;&s;ion
a Folly; what would become of the</HI>
Catholick Religion <HI>without this Mor|tification,
which curbs our Inclinations
<PB N="253" REF="257">
and hinders us from abandoning our
&s;elves entirely to our Lu&s;t: I know
very well what I &s;aid,</HI> reply'd the
Dutche&s;s interrupting him, <HI>my mean|ing
was, that in a ca&s;e of Gallantry,
or &s;ome other in&s;ignificant Trifles, one
need not be &s;o &s;incere and open hearted
to ones Confe&s;&s;or; for their Inclinati|ons
being very often on the wrong &s;ide
as well as our own, being &s;inful Men,
as well as the re&s;t of Mankind, they
divert them&s;elves with &s;uch like Con|fe&s;&s;ions,
at our co&s;t.</HI> The Duke of
<HI>O&mdash;s</HI> who always paid a blind O|bedience
to Religious Men, and the
Fathers of the Church, left the
Dutche&s;s alone abruptly, and all the
time they were at Dinner would not
&s;o much as &s;ay one word to her. He
was in the &s;ame Humour at Supper,
till the Dutche&s;s breaking &s;ilence
fir&s;t, ask'd how he liked the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Wine. <HI>'Tis admirable good, Madam,</HI>
reply'd he, &s;carce minding what &s;he
&s;aid, and ta&s;ting only a little of it.
<HI>Father</HI> Amelot'<HI>s Health,</HI> return'd &s;he
&s;miling, <HI>he is a Confe&s;&s;or that knows
<PB N="254" REF="258">
how to accommodate him&s;elf to the in|con&s;tant
Temper of Men, who could have
thought that this Saint like Father,
could give &s;uch charitable Advice to his
Penitents, to change their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es
once a Month, or once a Week; and
then &s;urely,</HI> added the Dutche&s;s cold|ly,
<HI>they will commit no cu&s;tomary Sin,
nor of any great con&s;equence.</HI> The
Duke of <HI>O</HI>&mdash;<HI>s,</HI> who found the
Dutche&s;s in a Je&s;ting Humour, would
not return her one word in an&s;wer,
but aro&s;e from the Table &s;ooner
than he u&s;ed to do, and &s;hut him|&s;elf
up in his Bed Chamber, without
making her the u&s;ual Compliments.
The next day following the Dutch|e&s;s
of&mdash;tired with the Duke's
Capricious Temper, had a mind to
divert her Dome&s;tick Vexations in
the Company of the Count <HI>de $ude,</HI>
and the Lord <HI>Grave:</HI> This la&s;t of
the&s;e two entertain'd her all that day
with abundance of Tenderne&s;s, and
repre&s;ented his Pa&s;&s;ion to her in its
true Natural Colours; his Addre&s;&s;es
were not altogether received with
<PB N="255" REF="259">
Indifferency; for the Dutche&s;s told
him, that if he proved as &s;incere as
he pretended to be, he might hope
to be believed. <HI>Can you que&s;tion it,
Madam,</HI> cry'd the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lord,
throwing him&s;elf at her Feet with a
mo&s;t Pa&s;&s;ionate Air, <HI>what Mortal on
Earth could be guilty of &s;uch a piece
of Di&s;&s;imulation to the Faire&s;t Lady in
the World, unle&s;s, out of Re&s;pect, he
&s;hould not dare to di&s;cover his real
Sentiments. O!</HI> added he &s;ighing,
<HI>I am perhaps too &s;incere for my Re|po&s;e.
Sincerity, my Lord,</HI> reply'd the
Dutche&s;s with a tender Look, <HI>is &s;$l|dom
blamed in a Lover, e&s;pecially &s;ince
it is &s;uch a Rarity among Men at this
time. Madam,</HI> &s;aid my Lord quite
tran&s;ported, <HI>this Qualification is not
&s;o rarely to be met with in</HI> England,
<HI>as it is in</HI> France; <HI>our</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Gen|tlemen
take a Pride in being &s;incere
and faithful in all their Actions. Some
of them my Lord,</HI> reply'd the Dutch|e&s;s
of&mdash;Smiling, <HI>for I have
known others of that Nation, who are
not &s;o nice in point of Con&s;cience, and
<PB N="256" REF="260">
who will not be &s;crupulous to deceive a
Woman, as well as the</HI> French, <HI>who
have their Tears, Sighs and Complaints
at hand, whenever they are inclined to
weep, &s;igh and complain: You know,</HI>
continued &s;he with a Charming
Air, <HI>the Duke</HI> de la Fayette? <HI>I be|lieve
I have &s;een him a thou&s;and times
Weeping at the Feet of a certain Fair
Lady, whom he pretended to Love,
from the very bottom of his Heart and
Soul, and Laughing within a Moment
after, as loud as he could, like a Fool.
Is not this an in&s;upportable Piece of
Extravagancy, which would make one

that all the&s;e Faints are not plea|&s;ing

who had not &s;poke one word to the
Dutche&s;s of&mdash;&s;ince the other

to take every day a Solitary Walk
in the Wood, he happened to come
back from one of the&s;e Walks at
this time, attended only by a few,
and meeting with one of his Inti|mate
Friends, who had more Malice
than good Sen&s;e, he was told by
him, That the Lord <HI>Grave</HI> had at|tended
his Spou&s;e the whole After|noon,
which put him into a very bad
humour, and made him ask his
Friend, (rubbing his Forehead all
the while) whether he was there
&s;till; <HI>yes, Sir,</HI> reply'd he, <HI>if you make
ha&s;te you will meet with him,</HI> &s;o on he
went as fa&s;t as he could, hoping to

Spies abroad as well as he, de&s;ired
him in good time to be gone, &s;o

her that the Duke was coming home.
The Duke had no &s;ooner &s;et his
Foot within the Palace, but &s;trait
he runs up to the Dutche&s;&s;es Apart|ment,
who was reading &s;ome Novel
for her Diver&s;ion; but his Head be|ing
full of tho&s;e Notions that were
told him by his Friend, he would
not &s;tir out of the Room for a con|&s;iderable
time, and at la&s;t his Curio|&s;ity
went &s;o far as to de&s;ire her to
let him have the Key of her Clo&s;et,
pretending he left &s;omething there
that he wanted. The Dutche&s;s
who knew her Gallant to be out of
reach, frankly opened the Clo&s;et,
and &s;eeing him peeping into every
corner, reproach'd him, tho in very
hand&s;ome Terms, with his Jealous
Temper; and the Duke was not a

took his Opportunity when the

Meadow near the Banks of the</HI>

her whither &s;he was going.</HI> Madam,

agreeable Air,</HI> I am to go to the next
Village, to carry to the Dutche&s;s of

&s;he taking him by the Hand,</HI> who
thought to have met you here in this
Country Di&s;gui&s;e; truly you have been
too hard for me, I verily took you for
a Country Maid. This is a very pretty
Device enough, to &s;urprize Ladies, &s;uch
a one as I &s;hould not have &s;o much as
dream'd of. See and mind Ladies,
<HI>&s;aid my Lord in a very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive
manner,</HI> what a true and &s;incere Love
is capable of undertaking. I believe it
my Lord, <HI>&s;aid the Dutche&s;s of</HI>&mdash;

you are come to &s;ee whether &s;ome Amo|rous
Shepherd or other does not endea|vour

that has brought me hither, <HI>re|ply'd
this Lover with a deep Sigh,</HI>
is in a Station far beyond me, and wor|thy
the Adoration of the Vniver&s;e.
Then my Lord, <HI>reply'd the Dutche&s;s
of&mdash;Laughing,</HI> it &s;eems it is
no le&s;s than a Deity, that has known
<PB N="263" REF="267">
how to Charm you at &s;uch a rate; for
we know that formerly, Men u&s;ed to
fall de&s;perately in Love with the Cele|&s;tial
Powers. Thus <HI>Endymion,</HI> that
famous A&s;trologer, whom <HI>Ovid</HI> &s;o fre|quently
introduces in his Works, was
&s;o pa&s;&s;ionately in Love with the Moon,
call'd otherwi&s;e <HI>Diana,</HI> that he got &s;oon
acquainted even with the lea&s;t Move|ment
of that Planet. Do you que&s;tion,
Madam, <HI>&s;aid the Dutche&s;s</HI> de Crequi
<HI>coldly,</HI> that my Lord does not hope
for the &s;ame Advantages as <HI>Endymion</HI>
had in re&s;pect to <HI>Diana.</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e the
&s;ecret Motions of his Godde&s;s are as

were to this A&s;trologer. As far as I
&s;ee, <HI>&s;aid the Counte&s;s</HI> de Soi&s;&s;ons,
there is abundance of Learning and
Conjuration in Love, notwith&s;tanding
its being a Pa&s;&s;ion which is natural to
the mo&s;t ignorant; nay, the unrational
Creatures them&s;elves teach to Love,
and a Man mu&s;t not be of the Offspring
of <HI>Adam,</HI> if he loves not a Woman;
and a Female mu&s;t not be a Woman, if
&s;he is able to re&s;i&s;t the Artificial In&s;inu|ations
<PB N="264" REF="268">
of Men. For my part, <HI>&s;aid the
Dutche&s;s</HI> de Crequi, <HI>interrupting her
and Laughing aloud,</HI> I am actually of
Opinion, that the <HI>Serpent</HI> who in&s;inu|ated
him&s;elf into the Womans good
Opinion in the Terre&s;tial Paradi&s;e,
appeared to her under the Shape of a
Man, for otherwi&s;e I am apt to believe
&s;he would not have been &s;o weak, to give
credit to what he &s;aid, and to be thus
bewitch'd by his Di&s;cour&s;e. I am of
the &s;ame Opinion, <HI>&s;aid the Dutche&s;s
of&mdash;ari&s;ing from the Ground,</HI>
this flattering <HI>Serpent</HI> made u&s;e of the
Deceitfulne&s;s of Men, to &s;educe the

out of Re&s;pect to the Ladies,</HI>
will you give me leave Ladies, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI>
to give you my Opinion, which is not
incongruous to what &s;ome Authors
have maintained long ago, That <HI>Adam</HI>
being very &s;olitary one Day in the
Garden, and having an Inclination
<PB N="265" REF="269">
to try his Wife's Con&s;tancy and Re&s;olu|tion,
transform'd him&s;elf into the
&s;hape of this cunning Devil. An ad|mirable
Thought, <HI>cry'd Madam</HI> de

to this day mo&s;t of the nature of
Serpents, which you know have a long
Tail, the true Emblem of the Treache|ry,
Di&s;&s;imulation and Flattery of Man|kind.
You had better told us, <HI>&s;aid
the Counte&s;s</HI> de Soi&s;&s;ons <HI>in a Je&s;t,</HI> that
this part has &s;ome re&s;emblance to what

words, and told her,</HI> Counte&s;s, as far
as I can &s;ee, 'tis not without rea&s;on
you have the Reputation of being a Lo|ver
of Tails. <HI>Madam</HI> de Soi&s;&s;ons <HI>did
not think fit to return the lea&s;t An|&s;wer,
perceiving &s;he had been be|tray'd
by the Marque&s;s</HI> de Varde, <HI>(an
intimate Friend of the Count</HI> de
Guiche'<HI>s) and &s;ome others of her Fa|vourites,
when &s;he had got the By-Name

<HI>But to return to our Ladies, the&s;e
went back to the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;

with them, without allowing the
liberty to lay a&s;ide his Country
Maids Dre&s;s, which they liked &s;o
extreamly well, he acting his Part to

pretty in her Straw Hat. Love be|ing
a thing that is catching, and gains

it was the Dutche&s;s de Crequi</HI>'s <HI>Mis|fortune

to fall in Love with the</HI> Engli&s;h

with them in his Country Habit, and
u&s;ed the &s;ame freedom there, as if he

of&mdash;&s;he told him with a ten|der
Look, <HI>Go, go, my Lord, it &s;hall
be remembred to your Advantage;
as well as</HI> &hellip;. The Duke of
<HI>O&mdash;s</HI> who come in at that in&s;tant
in a pen&s;ive Condition, put the
Dutche&s;s a little out of Countenance,
while her Lover went his way, as
well &s;atisfy'd as po&s;&s;ibly can be ima|gin'd.
The Duke of <HI>O&mdash;s</HI> went
into the Dutche&s;&s;es Bed Chamber
without &s;peaking one word to her,
which made her &s;ay with a &s;mile to
one of her Ladies, <HI>that the Duke had
got &s;ome new whim&s;y in his head.</HI> In
the Afternoon the Duke of&mdash;
who ever &s;ince his late Vow he had
made to <HI>St. Remi,</HI> had taken a di|&s;ta&s;te
at the World, but e&s;pecially
<PB N="275" REF="279">
at the Fair Sex, (who never were
his be&s;t Favourites) got on Hor&s;e|back
in company of 3 of his inti|mate
Friends to go a Hunting with
him, and after that to pa&s;s away
&s;ome time at St. <HI>Clou,</HI> as merrily as
po&s;&s;ibly they could, as &s;uch a di|&s;tance
from Court. The&s;e 3 Gen|tlemen,
who&s;e Names I will forbear
to mention here, had perhaps as
weighty Motives to ab&s;ent them|&s;elves
from Court as the Duke him|&s;elf
had: One of the&s;e Three had
had the misfortune to pre&s;ent to one
of the mo&s;t Fanta&s;tical Ladies of
our Times, a piece of Meat at a
Fea&s;t which &s;he did not like; and
the other having apply'd him&s;elf for
his Diver&s;ion to the Study of Chi|rurgery,
had put a Tent in the
Wound of a Lady of Quality, which
did produce an unexpected Operati|on;
and the third affected a &s;ort of
neglect of every thing he &s;aw, be|ing
re&s;olved to turn <HI>Man hater;</HI> &s;o
happy an Union of Tempers could
not but make them very merry, and
<PB N="276" REF="280">
they were not &s;paring for delicious
Liquors or Meats to encrea&s;e their
Mirth; when one of the&s;e Members
of the Society of Reformation, in|terrupted
their pious Conver&s;ations
which run upon the Excellency of
<HI>Bacchus,</HI> and told them with an Air,
which &s;ufficiently di&s;covered his Re|&s;olution
of falling out with the
World. <HI>O!</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>how happy are
we at this time, to be out of the noi&s;e
of the Court, and remote from the&s;e
Vanities which di&s;turb the Hearts of
Mankind, and make them Slaves to
their Chimerical Notions: But,</HI> added
he &s;ighing, <HI>a Man mu&s;t be induced
with peculiar Graces from above, to
take his farewell of the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions,
which Tyrannize over our Hearts, and
$ntangle us into ine&s;timable Errors.
Nothing can be more charming than to
confine all our de&s;ires to plea&s;e him
who has given us our Being; let us
work out our Salvation with fear and
trembling, yet &s;o as not to deprive our
&s;elves of the Enjoyments of good Chear,
<PB N="277" REF="281">
or to &s;poil our Eyes with continual
weeping for our Sins.</HI> This la&s;t Opi|nion
having the Approbation of the
Duke and his Company, they &s;pent
the whole Night in Drinking, and
the next day they went abroad a|gain
a Hunting. After Supper they
were diverted with a Con&s;ort of
Mu&s;ick, &s;uch a one as was not very
&s;uitable to check the Concupi&s;cencies
of our Sen&s;es; and after this our
<HI>Penitential Brethren</HI> run roaring
thro' the Streets in the Apo&s;tles
Dre&s;s, like a Company of Mad-men,
knocking at every Door they pa&s;s'd
by. The Duke of&mdash;who
felt &s;till &s;ome Remnants of the Re|bellious
Fle&s;h, being at &s;ome di&s;tance
after the re&s;t, and e&s;pying a Light
in a little Window, drew nearer,
and happening to &s;ee through the
Gla&s;s a very hand&s;ome young Wo|man,
he had not &s;ufficient Power to
keep under the&s;e Carnal Commoti|ons
of his vigorous Body, in &s;pite
of all the Re&s;i&s;tance and Addre&s;&s;es
<PB N="278" REF="282">
he was able to make to that Saint,
the Image whereof he wore in his
Hat, to <HI>protect him again&s;t all Tem|tations
of the Fle&s;h.</HI> But being inter|rupted
and call'd for by the Duke
of <HI>O&mdash;s</HI> and his Companions, they
went to hear Ma&s;s in 2 or 3 Places
as &s;oon as it was day break, and ha|ving
dipt their Faces all over in <HI>Ho|ly
Water,</HI> and fortify'd them&s;elves
with a good number of Sings of the
Cro&s;s, they took a mo&s;t plentiful
and delicious Breakfa&s;t, and after
this, taking a Walk in the Park,
and the Diver&s;ion of a &s;et of Vio|lins,
they retired into a Wood, with
the&s;e Marks of Tranquility and Ea&s;e
in their Countenances, as are com|monly
ob&s;erved in tho&s;e who ea&s;ily
&s;et their Con&s;ciences at re&s;t, their
di&s;cour&s;e all this while running up|on
nothing el&s;e but how to de&s;pi&s;e
the World, and to try the Conver|&s;ation
of Mankind. Being well
tired with the&s;e frivolous Reflecti|ons,
the Duke of&mdash;who &s;till
<PB N="279" REF="283">
retained in his Remembrance the
Fair one he happened to &s;ee the
Night before, took a Re&s;olution to
go to the &s;ame Place again at the
&s;ame hour, and to try whether he
could not come to the Speech of her,
while the Family was a&s;leep, which
he did without much difficulty;
for this pretty Girl had a Gallant,
whom &s;he dur&s;t not &s;ee but in the
Night time, for fear of her Friends;
but &s;o it happened by good Chance,
that mi&s;&s;ing to come that Evening at
the u&s;ual time, the Duke had an
Opportunity of talking to her; and
the young Wench, who thought no
otherwi&s;e by his Apo&s;tles dre&s;s, but
that he had been &s;ome hone&s;t Fryar,
who had lo&s;t his way, was &s;o Cha|ritable
as to take him in, and not
long after fell a&s;leep: The Duke,
who &s;aw her lie in a little Bed, being
mightily &s;mitten with her Charms,
went after her into the Chamber,
and finding her half a&s;leep, had
&s;ufficient Time and Opportunity to
<PB N="280" REF="284">
commit &s;ome Amorous Robberies,
without the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance on her
&s;ide, imagining no otherwi&s;e than
that it was really her Gallant, who
u&s;ed to entertain her thus all the
Night long. The Duke &s;oon found
out her Mi&s;take, (while he cla&s;p'd
her in his Arms and Ki&s;'d her)
when he heard her &s;ay; <HI>My dear</HI>
Troil, <HI>you Squeeze me to Death, but
your Care&s;&s;es are very engaging;</HI> (this
being the Name of her Gallant) but
our Apo&s;tle, who was no Novice in
Gallantry, was not forward to un|deceive
his Fair Companion, but
got as many Favours as he could of
his Fair unknown, who was not ve|ry
covetous of them, being ignorant
upon whom &s;he be&s;tow'd them, be|cau&s;e
<HI>in the Dark all Cats are Grey.</HI>
Day break now beginning to appear,
the Duke got out of his Quarters as
well &s;atisfy'd as if he had been a
King, tho not without &s;ome regret
to &s;ee him&s;elf obliged to leave a
Place, which had afforded him &s;uch
<PB N="281" REF="285">
Enjoyments; for he own'd after|wards,
that he never met with &s;o
&s;weet and plea&s;ant a Road in the
whole Empire of <HI>Venus,</HI> as this. The
Duke of <HI>O&mdash;s</HI> did al&s;o not fail to
take his own Diver&s;ions, and being
&s;omewhat tired, fell a&s;leep towards
Morning, when the Duke of&mdash;
came home and went to Bed, with
as much Privacy, as if he had been
there all Night: For the Count of
&mdash;who lay in the &s;ame Cham|ber,
being &s;o fa&s;t a&s;leep, as well as
their Dome&s;ticks, as if they had ta|ken
a Do&s;e of <HI>Opium,</HI> no Body knew
of his coming into the Hou&s;e. In
the Forenoon the Duke went into
the Duke of&mdash;Chamber, and
finding him &s;till in Bed, <HI>I don't ima|gine,</HI>
&s;ays he, <HI>Sir, that the Road you
cho&s;e is that which is to lead you to
Glory:</HI> And the Duke was &s;o frank
as to confe&s;s his Frailty in that kind,
telling him, That they mu&s;t addre&s;s
them&s;elves in a peculiar Prayer to
the Pious St. <HI>Remi,</HI> to de&s;ire him,
<PB N="282" REF="286">
not to enter into his Book this Fault,
which was owing to human Frailty,
for want of &s;ufficient &s;trength to re|&s;i&s;t
the Force and Temptations of
Sin: The Propo&s;ition meeting with
a general Approbation, our Penitents
were no &s;ooner got out of Bed, but
upon their Marrowbones recited the
following &s;hort Prayer.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="prayer">
<HEAD>The Prayer.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;INcomparable Saint, the Faire&s;t
and Brighte&s;t of all tho&s;e that
dwell in Heaven; &s;ee here we are
at your Feet, mo&s;t humbly be&s;eech|ing
you, not to call us to an ac|count
for all the Sins of our Youth.
You are doubtle&s;s not ignorant,
Great Martyr, how Rebellious a
thing the Fle&s;h is, and how diffi|cult
a Task it is, to bridle it. The
De&s;ires of Concupi&s;cency are revi|ved
in me daily, in &s;pight of all
our Endeavours to keep them un|der.
<PB N="283" REF="287">
Alas! Favourite of Heaven,
how often have we attempted to
check the Titillations of the Fle&s;h,
which from time to time in&s;inuate
them&s;elves into our Hearts. The
Plea&s;ures of the Sen&s;es are the dead|ly
Enticements to Vice, which are
common to all Men, and will, good
Saint, entirely play the Ma&s;ters o|ver
us, unle&s;s you take pity of us
poor Sinners, and &s;helter us under
your Shade, which is the Refuge
of afflicted Souls.&endq; <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides this &s;hort Prayer, they had
recour&s;e al&s;o to other Mortifications
and Actions of Devotion, &s;uch as
the &s;courging of their Sinful Parts
with Rods: After this, they went
to Dinner, where they took care to
eat and drink, like Penitents, who
&s;tood in need of good and comfor|table
Refre&s;hments, after their Pe|nances.
The Afternoon was &s;pent,
in making Reflections upon the tran|&s;itorine&s;s
<PB N="284" REF="288">
of Human Affairs, and up|on
certain Points of Morality, as
al&s;o in making a &s;erious Application
of their Penance, towards the ob|taining
of their Salvation. Toward
the Evening the good Company, af|ter
having embraced one another,
return'd to <HI>Paris</HI> every one to his
own home, in order to recollect in
their re&s;pective Retirements, what
Satisfaction and Vexation they had
received in their Progre&s;s; the Duke
of <HI>O&mdash;s</HI> prote&s;ting to them at part|ing,
that he would from that Mi|nute
begin to endeavour to procure
the Peace of his Soul, in hopes that
by the Pious and Wonderful Con|duct
of his Life, he might obtain a
Place in the Calendar among the
Saints.</P>
<P>But the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;who
had improved her Husband's Ab|&s;ence
to her own Advantage, had
pa&s;s'd her time plea&s;antly enough
with the Count <HI>de Lude;</HI> and the Sa|tisfaction
&s;he had taken in his Con|ver&s;ation,
<PB N="285" REF="289">
being &s;uch as &s;erved only
to whet her Appetite, &s;he was re|&s;olved
not to let &s;lip the next op|portunity
that &s;hould offer, which
happen'd &s;oon after: For the Duke
of&mdash;being at his Devotions in
the <HI>Chappel Royal,</HI> the Count <HI>de
Lude</HI> fail'd not to make a Vi&s;it at
the Dutche&s;s's, who was as yet in her
<HI>Di&s;habilee.</HI> His Reception was very
favourable, and as &s;oon as &s;he was
Dre&s;s'd, &s;he conducted him into a
large Clo&s;et, ordering her Women
(that were her Confidents) to tell
the Duke when he came home, that
&s;he was gone abroad a Vi&s;iting. <HI>So
early,</HI> &s;aid the Duke not without
&s;ome Surprize when he was told &s;o,
<HI>it is not late enough yet to be &s;een a|bout
the Streets;</HI> and &s;o went into
his Clo&s;et, and took a Book of De|votion
to read in. The Dutche&s;s
in the mean while being very unea|&s;ie,
while the Count entertain'd her
with the mo&s;t Charming and mo&s;t
Tender Expre&s;&s;ions in the World,
<PB N="286" REF="290">
embracing her Knees with inexpre&s;|&s;ible
Tran&s;ports of Plea&s;ure: <HI>Alas,
Count,</HI> &s;ays &s;he with an engaging
Voice, <HI>we dread that mo&s;t we do not
care to &s;ee: The Duke is Jealous to a
degree of Madne&s;s; and I &s;hould run
di&s;tracted, if he &s;hould hear that you
are here.</HI> My Lord <HI>Grave</HI> happen|ing
to pa&s;s by that way in a Coach,
and e&s;pying the Count's Livery, be|gan
to mi&s;tru&s;t the matter, that he
was become his Rival, and was at
that very time with the Dutche&s;s of
&mdash;which was a &s;ufficient Mo|tive
for him to pay a Vi&s;it to her
likewi&s;e; but the Dutche&s;s was in|vi&s;ible
that Morning to every Body
el&s;e, but the Count <HI>de Lude,</HI> who
took his leave of her &s;oon after, ha|ving
fir&s;t conducted her to the
Church of <HI>our Lady;</HI> whither &s;he
went to hear a famous Preacher,
that was to Preach there that day.
The Duke &s;eeing her come home|ward,
being exceedingly troubled at
that time with his old Di&s;temper,
<PB N="287" REF="291">
<HI>Jealou&s;ie,</HI> told her, while he was
rubbing his Forehead. <HI>Well, Madam,
how do you like Father</HI> Archangel'<HI>s
Sermon, have you received any Benefit
by his Moral Precepts, and by that
dreadful Judgment he denounced to
Sinners. I prote&s;t to you, Sir,</HI> reply'd
the Dutche&s;s acting the Bigot to the
Life, <HI>I never heard a more Learned
and Judicious Man in all my Life:
Oh! what a mo&s;t &s;urprizing way he
had,</HI> continued &s;he lifting up her
Eyes towards Heaven, <HI>to ravi&s;h our
Souls and rai&s;e them up to the Cele&s;tial
Paradi&s;e. Will you be plea&s;ed to tell
me, Madam,</HI> &s;aid the Duke, <HI>where he
took his Text? Yes, Sir,</HI> reply'd &s;he
coldly, <HI>it was out of the Lamentations
of the Prophet</HI> Jeremiah, Chap. 3.
v. 10. <HI>where this Holy Man laments
his being abandon'd by Heaven.</HI> They
lived together after this for &s;ome
time in a tolerable State of Tranqui|lity,
the Duke's Jealou&s;ie being
&s;omewhat allay'd by the Dutche&s;s's
dextrous An&s;wer, when a Journey
<PB N="288" REF="292">
for <HI>Flanders</HI> was hotly talk'd of at
Court. the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;be|ing
at that time very de&s;irous once
more to &s;ee her Brother King <HI>Charles</HI>
the II. of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> left the
Court at <HI>Li&s;le,</HI> attended by her own
Dome&s;ticks, and the Count de <HI>Lude</HI>
and my Lord <HI>Grave,</HI> who had al&s;o
an Inclination to take a turn into
<HI>England.</HI> The King of <HI>Great Bri|tain</HI>
went to meet them at <HI>Dover,</HI>
and the Interview pa&s;s'd with ex|ce&s;&s;ive
Demon&s;trations of mutual
Tenderne&s;s, as if they had been
foretold, that this was to be the
la&s;t time they &s;hould &s;ee one ano|ther.
Upon the coming back of
the Court to <HI>Paris,</HI> the Dutche&s;s of
<HI>O&mdash;s</HI> fell into a very deep Melan|choly,
which was taken notice of
by every body, for &s;he &s;hew'd in all
her Actions a certain carele&s;sne&s;s for
all the Vanities and Plea&s;ures of the
World; tho in the mid&s;t of this
Langui&s;hment, &s;he continued to be
the Object of Adoration of all that
<PB N="289" REF="293">
beheld her, without producing a|ny
thing but Indifferency on her
&s;ide. One day, the King, who&s;e
Inclinations were &s;till for her, ap|pointed
a Ball on purpo&s;e to divert
her, and had taken her out to Dance
&s;everal times; &s;he went into ano|ther
Room, and de&s;ired &s;omething
to Drink, being exce&s;&s;ive&punc; dry:
A Gla&s;s of Lemonade was brought
her, which &s;he took off very ha&s;ti|ly,
and was &s;uppo&s;ed to be the
Cau&s;e of her Death.</P>
<P>During her Sickne&s;s, which was
of no long Continuance, &s;he decla|red
to all that had the Honour to
&s;ee her, That &s;he was willing to
leave the World, without the lea&s;t
regret.</P>
<P>The King, was highly afflicted at
her Death, and &s;o was the whole
Court, at lea&s;t in outward appear|ance:
She was Interr'd at St. <HI>Dennis</HI>
among the Royal Tombs. While
the Court was in Mourning, no Di|ver&s;ions
were allow'd of there, un|le&s;s

for &s;ome time; till at la&s;t the Mar|riage
that was propo&s;ed betwixt
