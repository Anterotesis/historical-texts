<HEAD>A LETTER, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>UPON your con&s;ecration to the &s;ee of Landaff, your lord&s;hip has taken a very early opportunity of publi&s;hing certain propo&s;als for the benefit, as you conceive, of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church; and you have addre&s;&s;ed them to the head of the church, under the title of <HI>A Letter to His Grace the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, by Richard lord bi&s;hop of Landaff.</HI> A few copies of this pamphlet you had circulated in print &s;ome months ago, but for rea&s;ons not nece&s;&s;ary to be explained, a more general publication
<PB N="2" REF="4">
of it has been po&s;tponed from November to March.</P>
<P>The regulations recommended by your lord&s;hip in this pamphlet are propo&s;ed to be carried into effect by the introduction of a bill or bills into parliament. It is from your lord&s;hip's authority we are given to under&s;tand that you did not think fit to &s;ubmit the&s;e propo&s;als, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, to the judgement of his Grace of Canter|bury and the bench at large; and, if any one &s;hould be of opinion, this would have been a mea&s;ure more re&s;pectful to your right reverend brethren, than the &s;tep you have now taken, you &s;ignify your di&s;&s;ent from &s;uch opinion: You profe&s;s a <HI>di&s;po|&s;ition not to be wanting in re&s;pect to any of your brethren, but you cannot give up a de|cided opinion out of re&s;pect to any man or &s;et of men; and as to the utility of making the objects of your Letter publicly known, you have not the lea&s;t doubt or he&s;itation of mind.</HI> You ob&s;erve, that <HI>if you had previou&s;ly con&s;ulted the bench of bi&s;hops, you might have run the ri&s;que of treating them with apparent di&s;re|&s;pect; for had they advi&s;ed you to &s;uppre&s;s what you now make public, you would have</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="5">
<HI>been under the nece&s;&s;ity of neglecting their ad|vice:</HI> You inform us moreover, <HI>that you much di&s;like all private caballing in matters of pub|lic import.&mdash;</HI>The world at large is &s;o apt to be edified and entertained by every thing that falls from your lord&s;hip's pen, that any rea|&s;ons which &s;atisfy you in the ca&s;e would in all probability content the majority of man|kind: but as you have entered into a di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion of the motives why you did not think fit to communicate this Letter to his Grace of Canterbury or any others of the bench; many of your readers, who would not el&s;e have concerned them&s;elves in the que&s;tion, will now be tempted to take it into confideration, and as it is not impro|bable but &s;ome per&s;ons may be found to maintain opinions oppo&s;ite to your lord&s;hip's, &s;o it is po&s;&s;ible there may be &s;ome maintainers of tho&s;e opinions who (like your lord&s;hip) may not be di&s;po&s;ed <HI>to give them up out of re&s;pect to tho&s;e of any other man,</HI> though ever &s;o much <HI>decided</HI> in the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Some may be &s;o tenacious as to maintain, that it would have been more re&s;pectful in the junior bi&s;hop of the bench to have communi|cated his ideas to his &s;enior brethren, in a
<PB N="4" REF="6">
matter of eccle&s;ia&s;tical arrangement materially affecting the intere&s;ts of the hierarchy. <Q>&startq;If the new-made bi&s;hop of Landaff is &s;o deci|dedly convinced of the expediency of this reform, if it is &s;o clear,&endq; the&s;e rea&s;oners may &s;ay,</Q> <Q>&startq;to the intellects of this novice in the prelacy, why might not tho&s;e of more experience and equal talents view it with the &s;ame degree of per&s;picuity?&endq;</Q> But this kind of rea&s;oning will not impo&s;e upon your &s;agacity; you &s;u&s;pected that the judgement of your brethren would not be with you in this propo&s;al, el&s;e you would not have excluded them from their &s;hare of credit in the mea&s;ure; neither would you have lo&s;t the grace of doing that with their concurrence previou&s;ly obtained, which ul|timately cannot be done without it. This would at lea&s;t have given them an opportu|nity of acceding with dignity to a &s;elf-de|nying plan, and not <HI>compelling them to come in</HI> by the terrors of the laity and the invec|tives of the pre&s;s. If they had agreed with you in the great outline of the reform, they might po&s;&s;ibly have done &s;ome little unim|portant underwork in the modification of it for parliament; in the wording and forma|tion
<PB N="5" REF="7">
of a bill perhaps they might, by them|&s;elves or their connexions, have worked under your lord&s;hip's au&s;pices to &s;ome u&s;e and ac|count; for I hope I &s;hall not offend in &s;up|po&s;ing, that the compilation of a bill for par|liament may have been among&s;t the very few branches of &s;tudy that did not come under your contemplation <HI>inter &s;ylvas academi,</HI> as you expre&s;s it; or in plain Engli&s;h, at the univer&s;ity of Cambridge. However, of this it is fit I &s;peak doubtingly, as you tell us you had revolved this plan of reform in va|rious ways, whil&s;t you was there, and had canva&s;&s;ed it in conver&s;ation with your learned and pious companions in that &s;eat of eru|dition; though you think it might have been deemed great pre&s;umption in you to have pre&s;ented your thoughts to his Grace of Canterbury from your &s;tation there, before you was elevated to the rank you now hold in the church.</P>
<P>In&s;tances of humility in men of merit have a peculiar grace; but how it could have been deemed pre&s;umption in the profe&s;&s;or of divinity, to offer his &s;entiments to the head of the church, with a mode&s;t intention to promote the honour and &s;ervice of the
<PB N="6" REF="8">
e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, I am at a lo&s;s to divine; and I am &s;o unfortunate as to think, in op|po&s;ition to your lord&s;hip's better judgement, that if the mode you have now taken of pub|li&s;hing this Letter as a pamphlet without communicating it to the per&s;on it is addre&s;&s;ed to, was in either ca&s;e to be adopted, it would have been more excu&s;able in a pri|vate churchman &s;o to have acted towards the archbi&s;hop, than in a member of his own fraternity. A man may be well capable of projecting &s;chemes and &s;y&s;tems of reform <HI>inter &s;ylvas academi,</HI> but if he is in a pri|vate and &s;ubordinate &s;tation, he cannot &s;o readily call the elders of the church together, or induce them to &s;it in council on his pro|po&s;als. Having no official acce&s;s to the bench or to the &s;enate, &s;uch a man will of nece&s;&s;ity addre&s;s him&s;elf to the public, and through the channel of the pre&s;s u&s;her his ideas to the attention of the legi&s;lature; but that a prelate, who can at all times call upon his brethren for their collected opinions, that a lord of parliament, who in his place can produce and put in motion his own &s;ugge&s;tions for the benefit of church or &s;tate, &s;hould think it more re&s;pectful to his
<PB N="7" REF="9">
brother bi&s;hops, and more becoming of him&s;elf, to make public his opinions for re|forming the church through the channel of the pre&s;s, rather than through his own or|gans in that &s;enate to which he belongs, is a refinement in propriety to which my com|prehen&s;ion does not reach.</P>
<P>If the bench of bi&s;hops had in part or whole rejected your &s;ugge&s;tions; if the legi&s;|lature had wanted the will, or not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the virtue, to adopt and make efficient your propo&s;als, the pre&s;s was &s;till open, and as your lord&s;hip's opinion was peremptory and decid|ed for re&s;orting to publication, though any man or every man was oppo&s;ed to you in opi|nion, there was no danger but that in the la&s;t in&s;tance the&s;e ine&s;timable re&s;earches, revolved in &s;o many various ways, and canva&s;&s;ed in the cour&s;e of &s;o many learned conver&s;ations among&s;t the groves of Cambridge, would have &s;een the light. You would then at lea&s;t have known what your right reverend brethren had to &s;ay upon the &s;ubject, and to which branch of the legi&s;lature to have imputed the ob|&s;truction of your reform; indeed it is &s;o hard to find any rea&s;on for pa&s;&s;ing over your brethren, and re&s;orting to publication in the
<PB N="8" REF="10">
very fir&s;t in&s;tance, if you could have &s;up|po&s;ed they would have joined you in the mea&s;ure, that I mu&s;t believe you took for granted they would not be with you in it. It is at lea&s;t a fair imputation to the contrary; it is a mode of dealing that mo&s;t certainly implies &s;u&s;picion, and therefore, until a want of confidence can be made appear to be a mark of re&s;pect, I cannot think your lord|&s;hip has cho&s;en the happie&s;t method of ex|pre&s;&s;ing that courte&s;y to the bench which you are plea&s;ed to profe&s;s, and no doubt in|tended to ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>There is one kind of &s;u&s;picion, which your lord&s;hip's want of confidence in the bench of bi&s;hops, and indeed the tenour of your publication, will naturally in&s;inuate to the world, and yet I am loth to believe it weighed in your thoughts, which is that of worldly-minded prejudices in favour of the unequal di&s;tribution of epi&s;copal revenues, or, as your lord&s;hip expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>of a mean attention to the emoluments of the pre&s;ent mode of church government.</HI> Now, as you have in your own per&s;on pointedly di&s;avowed <HI>any mean attention</HI> of this &s;ort, and expect with ju&s;tice that we &s;hould believe you, it would
<PB N="9" REF="11">
be hard indeed to &s;uppo&s;e, with any &s;ha|dow of Chri&s;tian charity in our bo&s;oms, that you &s;hould arrogate to your&s;elf alone a &s;pi|ritual purity, for which you do not credit the re&s;t of your fraternity. But then again it is ju&s;t as hard to account, if you had credited the bench for this &s;piritual purity, why you &s;hould not have tru&s;ted them with your plan of reform; a plan, which can only be carried into execution by their aid, and the &s;anction of the legi&s;lature: it is as hard to di&s;cover a motive for your conduct in &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing this plan, whil&s;t you was a private divine, when no &s;uch imputation would have attended it's publication, and &s;eizing that very moment for doing it, when the in|ference could not fail of being made in their disfavour and contempt.</P>
<P>Your lord&s;hip, among&s;t other good plans that you are meditating for the honour and advantage of the church, wi&s;hes to reduce the bi&s;hoprics to a level in point of income; and though you have long conceived this plan of levelling the richer mitres with the poorer, you will not broach it, whil&s;t you are a private man, unintere&s;ted in the pro|po&s;al: but no &s;ooner do you &s;tep into the
<PB N="10" REF="12">
poor &s;ee of Landaff than out comes a pam|phlet, in which you call upon the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, as head of the church, to adopt your plan; or rather I &s;hould &s;ay, you call upon the people to &s;hame his Grace, and the re&s;t of the bench, into a compelled ac|cordance to your ideas. A bi&s;hop proclaims to the people, through the organs of the pre&s;s, what it is right for his own order to do, and he holds it for a mark of re&s;pect to his own order, not to let them into the &s;ecret beforehand. A lord of parliament harangues the world, without doors, upon a plan of reform, which he him&s;elf is competent to propo&s;e to the &s;upreme hereditary coun&s;el|lors of the nation in his own place, within doors. This is very polite to the people, my lord; but I much doubt it's courte&s;y to your brother peers: to the &s;piritual part of them, at lea&s;t, it will convey a &s;u&s;picion, that you doubted either their virtue or their under&s;tanding. By the &s;ame rule of conduct any &s;enator, in either hou&s;e, having a plan to propo&s;e for the benefit of church or &s;tate, may walk out of the doors of the &s;e|nate to which he belongs, and proclaim it from the hu&s;tings, or publi&s;h it from a new&s;|paper,
<PB N="11" REF="13">
and tell us in excu&s;e, that he thinks this the mo&s;t re&s;pectful manner of acting towards that &s;enate, which he thus de&s;erts. <Q>&startq;I tell you without doors,&endq; he might &s;ay,</Q> <Q>&startq;what I and all within doors ought to do.&endq;</Q> "Have they refu&s;ed to do it?" one might an&s;wer; <Q>"No," he will &s;ay, &startq;for I was re&s;olved to communicate it to you in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and then, if they do it afterwards, the merit will be your's, for mobbing them into the mea&s;ure.&endq;</Q> <Q>&startq;This is very civil to us, the people,&endq; one of their number may reply,</Q> <Q>&startq;but how does it look towards your brethren?&endq;</Q> <Q>&startq;Per|fectly polite and con&s;iderate; I mean it as the greate&s;t mark of re&s;pect I can &s;hew them: for if they had not agreed to it, I was determined to tell you, and it is only making &s;hort work by beginning where I mu&s;t have fini&s;hed.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit to ob&s;erve upon one other remark, which your lord&s;hip has thrown out by way of ju&s;tification for pa&s;&s;ing over the bi&s;hops; viz. <HI>that you much di&s;like all private caballing in matters of public import.</HI> This method of excu&s;ing your neglect is of the &s;ame complexion with the neglect it&s;elf. If the omi&s;&s;ion was an in&s;tance of re&s;pect, &s;o may
<PB N="12" REF="14">
be al&s;o this rea&s;on for it. When you was a private man, you held it no di&s;grace to take into your council <HI>men of di&s;intere&s;ted probity, true Chri&s;tian &s;implicity, and excellent erudi|tion, inter &s;ylvas academi;</HI> when you became a bi&s;hop, you con&s;idered a council of bi&s;hops as <HI>a private cabal, which you much di&s;like.</HI> Is it becau&s;e <HI>that di&s;intere&s;ted probity, Chri&s;tian &s;implicity, and excellent erudition,</HI> which you found among&s;t your fellow-&s;tudents at Cam|bridge, is not to be found among&s;t your brother bi&s;hops in London? God forbid! If it be &s;o, you do well to reform them; if it be not &s;o, you do not well to neglect them. As to <HI>levelling</HI> them, you have effectually done that already by the word <HI>cabal;</HI> and I find you make a very &s;en&s;ible di&s;tinction in favour of your Cambridge friends; in their in&s;tance, it is a con&s;ultation of good and learned men; in that of the bi&s;hops, it is private cabal, from which you revolt with di&s;like.</P>
<P>So much for the motives: it will now be proper to examine the matter of your publi|cation.</P>
<P>Your lord&s;hip, in the out&s;et of your pam|phlet, takes &s;ome pains to defend the zeal of the clergy of England, for the church
<PB N="13" REF="15">
e&s;tabli&s;hment, again&s;t the imputation of an intere&s;ted attention to the <HI>craft, by which they have their livelihood;</HI> and this you do by contending, that they would in general procure as good, or a better provi&s;ion for them&s;elves and families in other profe&s;&s;ions, if there was no church e&s;tabli&s;hment. This is an a&s;&s;ertion, my lord, for which the clergy will not thank you, &s;uch of their number at lea&s;t who have a zeal for their religion; for if they could thrive &s;o well in the libe|ral profe&s;&s;ions without an e&s;tabli&s;hed church, it &s;hould &s;eem as if your lord&s;hip admitted that the liberal profe&s;&s;ions, and of cour&s;e the &s;tate in general, were not dependant upon that e&s;tabli&s;hment for their pro&s;perity; in fewer words, you a&s;&s;ert that the &s;tate could exi&s;t and flouri&s;h without the church, a doctrine rather novel for a member of the right reverend bench. You &s;ay it is a rare thing to &s;ee a churchman lifting his po&s;te|rity above the common level, by the profits of his profe&s;&s;ion: this allegation experience contradicts by numerous in&s;tances, and I hope the example of your lord&s;hip's po&s;terity will add to the number. You &s;ay, that an exertion of the &s;ame talents, which &s;erve to
<PB N="14" REF="16">
place a man on the bench of bi&s;hops, might have placed him on the bench of judges, and the genius of an archbi&s;hop might have rai&s;ed him to the dignity of a lord high chancellor. This is another allegation, I conceive, for which your brethren, and the religion they profe&s;s, will have no cau&s;e to thank you; it is to be hoped that &s;ome bi|&s;hops have been elevated to that order by the purity of their morals and the exemplarine&s;s of their piety; I have not hitherto under|&s;tood that the&s;e are requi&s;ites to the pro|motion of a lawyer: an acutene&s;s of talents, and an adroitne&s;s in defending either &s;ide of a cau&s;e, or even making the be&s;t of a bad one, are recommendations at the bar, but I did not know they were &s;o con&s;idered in the pulpit. The defenders of religion it is pre|&s;umed never argue but on the &s;tronge&s;t &s;ide; and the talents of a country par&s;on may be as di&s;&s;imilar from tho&s;e of a coun|try attorney, as his principles may be, with|out any derogation from his under&s;tanding or profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In times pa&s;t, it is true, the great &s;eal has been frequently in the hands of churchmen, but I believe few in&s;tances occur of men
<PB N="15" REF="17">
making their way to the mitre through the medium of the law. We need not, however, go back to times pa&s;t for in&s;tances of genius in the profe&s;&s;ion of the prie&s;thood; the whole circle of arts and &s;ciences bears te&s;timony to their talents and erudition. Whether we &s;peak of them individually or collectively, it is not po&s;&s;ible to &s;ay too much in their prai&s;e: the &s;tate is indebted to them as to &s;ubjects of the mo&s;t valuable &s;ort, and they have a claim upon its protection in a pecu|liar degree: no hone&s;t man can envy them their revenues, no prudent man would wi&s;h to &s;ee them dimini&s;hed; by their manners they ornament &s;ociety, by their morals they amend it. When I compare them with the illiterate lazy &s;warm that I have met in countries of another profe&s;&s;ion of faith, I have felt a national pride of heart in the com|pari&s;on: when I &s;ee their children &s;pread through all the liberal profe&s;&s;ions, when I meet them in our fleets and armies, in our public offices and &s;enate, I cannot but con|&s;ider every thing that threatens their pro&s;|perity, as a danger, in which every good &s;ub|ject has an intere&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="18">
In your next paragraph you admoni&s;h his Grace of Canterbury not to let the <HI>mere term innovation</HI> alarm him, or as your lord&s;hip more <HI>fully</HI> expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>alarm his apprehen&s;ion;</HI> that if &s;uch was the tendency of your pro|po&s;als, you would have thrown them and your pen into the fire.&mdash;I beg your lord&s;hip's pardon for rever&s;ing the order of your ex|pre&s;&s;ion in this quotation, for though you are plea&s;ed to declare that you <HI>would have thrown your pen fir&s;t and your propo&s;als after it,</HI> it would perhaps have been a more na|tural cour&s;e to have de&s;troyed the work fir&s;t and the tool afterwards, as it is not alto|gether &s;o clear how you would have written the propo&s;als after you had burnt your pen. You remark, <HI>that it is commonly &s;aid wi&s;e and good men look upon every attempt to reform what is ami&s;s in church or &s;tate as a matter of dangerous tendency;</HI> but you expre&s;s a doubt, whether <HI>there is not as much timi|dity as wi&s;dom, as much indolence as goodne&s;s in this caution.</HI> I think you have not ri&s;qued much in the a&s;&s;ertion of this doubt, for I am at a lo&s;s to under&s;tand how any <HI>wi&s;e</HI> or <HI>good</HI> man can knowingly reject any <HI>wi&s;e</HI> or
<PB N="17" REF="19">
<HI>good</HI> reform. Mere &s;peculative &s;chemes of Utopian policy will not impo&s;e upon the &s;agacity of a <HI>wi&s;e</HI> man, though they glitter in idea; becau&s;e he will weigh the con&s;e|quences, and fore&s;ee the inconveniences which the &s;hallow &s;hort-&s;ighted projector did not apprehend: but convince &s;uch a man of the <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> of a propo&s;al, and if he does not adopt it he is no longer a <HI>wi&s;e</HI> man. It does not follow that he has as much <HI>timidity</HI> as <HI>wi&s;dom; timidity</HI> may not have been his mo|tive for rejecting the propo&s;al, and in that ca&s;e he has none of either quality. If it was his motive, &s;o far is he from bringing the&s;e two qualities to a balance, that it is evi|dent he abounds in one and is devoid of the other. The &s;ame remark will hold good in the ca&s;e of oppo&s;ers to reforms in the church.</P>
<P>Your lord&s;hip next proceeds to &s;tate to the archbi&s;hop the propo&s;als you have in con|templation; <Q>but before you do this, you re|mind his Grace of a maxim of Solomon, &startq;not to meddle with them who are given to change;&endq;</Q> in which maxim your lord|&s;hip agrees with that wi&s;e king; and you add a pious ejaculation to God, <HI>to forbid</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="20">
that either the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury or your&s;elf &s;hould be induced <HI>to meddle with them who would wi&s;h you to change your fear of God into impiety, or your reverence for the king and con&s;titution into anarchy or rebellion.</HI> Since the penning of this ejaculation, the worthy metropolitan has been gathered to his ance&s;tors, and it is univer&s;ally under&s;tood his Grace was never guilty of the crime you warn him to avoid; the cautionary prayer therefore re&s;ts only with your lord&s;hip, and to that <HI>let all the people &s;ay Amen!</HI></P>
<P>The propo&s;als are two, viz. one re&s;pect|ing the revenues of the bi&s;hops; the other re&s;pecting tho&s;e of the inferior clergy, for the better-apportioned di&s;tribution of what the &s;tate allows for the maintenance of the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the bi&s;hoprics, you decline the trouble of entering into the hi&s;tory of the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the &s;everal archbi&s;hop|ricks and bi&s;hopricks, though you ob&s;erve <HI>it would be an ea&s;y matter to di&s;play much eru|dition on the &s;ubject;</HI> and you content your|&s;elf with ob&s;erving, that the fact is certain, that the revenues and patronages of the &s;ees are very unequal in value. On this fact you
<PB N="19" REF="21">
ground a propo&s;al, that a bill &s;hould be brought into parliament <HI>to render the bi&s;hop|ricks more equal to each other, both with re|&s;pect to income and patronage, by annexing part of the e&s;tates and part of the preferments of the richer bi&s;hopricks to the poorer, as they become vacant:</HI> by which latter provi&s;o you ob&s;erve that <HI>no injury is propo&s;ed to be done to the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the richer bi&s;hopricks.</HI></P>
<P>The advantages re&s;ulting from this plan are; fir&s;t, the relea&s;ing the poorer bi&s;hops from the nece&s;&s;ity of holding eccle&s;ia&s;tical preferments <HI>in commendam</HI> with their bi&s;hop|ricks; <HI>a practice, which bears hard upon the rights and expectations of the re&s;t of the clergy; is di&s;agreeable to the bi&s;hops them&s;elves, and which expo&s;es them to much, perhaps, unde|&s;erved obloquy.</HI></P>
<P>It is undoubtedly to be wi&s;hed, that the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;upporting the poorer bi&s;hop|ricks by the aid of preferments <HI>in commen|dam</HI> did not exi&s;t; and &s;o long as it does ex|i&s;t, care &s;hould be taken to prevent abu&s;e and exce&s;s in the practice; certainly they might be u&s;ed with more moderation than they are in &s;ome in&s;tances at pre&s;ent.

the dignity of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, may ea&s;ily be enumerated; in &s;ome of the&s;e ca&s;es, and perhaps in all, mea&s;ures might be taken for aiding the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, without &s;tripping the church at large of any of its parochial bene|fices or livings; <HI>a cure of &s;ouls</HI> need in no ca&s;e to be annexed <HI>in commendam</HI> to a bi|&s;hoprick, and it is certainly to be wi&s;hed it was not. Bi&s;hops, who&s;e revenues do not reach the annual income of two thou&s;and pounds, or near upon, might be relieved in various modes without <HI>the cure of &s;ouls.</HI> When I except <HI>the cure of &s;ouls</HI> from pre|ferments held <HI>in commendam,</HI> I hope I may without pre&s;umption add, that the <HI>care of education,</HI> and <HI>&s;uperintendence of di&s;cipline,</HI> ought al&s;o to be excepted; and it has always &s;truck me, that ma&s;ter&s;hips of colleges in our univer&s;ities are not con&s;i&s;tently tenable with the duties of a dioce&s;e. If in any in|&s;tances the&s;e are held with bi&s;hopricks com|petent to maintain their incumbents, the practice is condemnable upon the face of it. Neither do I &s;ee how a profe&s;&s;or&s;hip in either univer&s;ity is compatible with the pa&s;toral duties, e&s;pecially of a di&s;tant dio|ce&s;e: what between parliament and the
<PB N="21" REF="23">
functions of his profe&s;&s;or&s;hip, &s;uch a prelate will find little time to dedicate to a re&s;idence among&s;t his clergy.</P>
<P>If the&s;e objections &s;hould appear to your lord&s;hip, as if I was yielding to the nece&s;&s;ity of the reform you have propo&s;ed, I beg to &s;ay, in arre&s;t of any &s;uch con&s;truction, that though I admit the abu&s;e of preferments held <HI>in commendam,</HI> I do not admit that this abu&s;e can no otherwi&s;e be remedied than by levelling the bi&s;hopricks.</P>
<P>The &s;tate and condition of every bi&s;hop ought in all rea&s;on to be &s;uch as &s;hould rou&s;e and encourage the inferior clergy to emulate their &s;uperiors in tho&s;e laudable and di&s;tingui&s;hing attainments, to which alone it is to be pre&s;umed they owe their elevation. There never was, in any period of our hi&s;tory, a bench of bi&s;hops filled by men of more acknowledged merit, than the pre&s;ent; there never was a monarch on the throne, who has kept the fountain of eccle&s;ia&s;tical honour purer than the reigning &s;overeign has done from the period of his acce&s;&s;ion. If how|ever, any one of the pre&s;ent bench accumu|lates in his per&s;on eccle&s;ia&s;tical preferments <HI>in commendam</HI> with a bi&s;hoprick &s;ufficient,

as I before ob&s;erved, of it&s;elf to &s;upport his dignity, it is to be wi&s;hed, (if any &s;uch there be) that prelatical monopolizer were reduced, and that one &s;hould be dimini&s;hed rather than the whole order be di&s;graced. No man, my lord, can di&s;pute the advantages of &s;end|ing back into circulation among&s;t the in|ferior clergy tho&s;e preferments which are generally and actually held <HI>in commendam:</HI> I am humbly of opinion mo&s;t of the&s;e might be di&s;charged; but if this cannot be done, and the bi&s;hopricks left upon their pre&s;ent footing, &s;till I cannot &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity or the prudence of doing it by your mode of le|velling the epi&s;copal revenues, for rea&s;ons, which I &s;hall hereafter &s;ubmit. In the meantime, till I am better advi&s;ed, I mu&s;t believe, that if tho&s;e bi&s;hopricks only were aided, which cannot duly be &s;upported with|out aid, the re&s;t of the clergy would have no cau&s;e for complaint, and the bi&s;hops would furni&s;h no occa&s;ion for obloquy. I hope I &s;hall not be mi&s;under&s;tood to &s;peak per&s;onally on this occa&s;ion; the &s;tate has thought fit to adopt a civil reform in this time of public exigency, but I could never without deep regret be &s;pectator of a reduc|tion
<PB N="23" REF="25">
of the revenues of the clergy, whether dignified or undignified. I am aware that your lord&s;hip's propo&s;al does not go gene|rally to this point, but partially and par|ticularly it does; an innovation, which, with &s;ome popular features to recommend it to the world upon a fir&s;t view, involves &s;uch con&s;equences as threaten ruin to the hierarchy. When I &s;ay this, let it not be under&s;tood that I a&s;cribe any but the be&s;t intention to your lord&s;hip: and if in the cour&s;e of the&s;e remarks I treat your argu|ments with a freedom that the pre&s;s admits of, and in fact demands, when truth is our pur&s;uit, I hope I &s;hall not be accounted wanting in that per&s;onal re&s;pect, which I have long and &s;incerely entertained for you.</P>
<P>The &s;econd argument, which your lord|&s;hip u&s;es in recommendation of your pro|po&s;al, is, that it would be a means of pro|moting the independence of the bi&s;hops in the hou&s;e of lords, and of preventing the influence, which either actually affects, or is &s;u&s;pected to affect, their minds too power|fully by the pro&s;pect of tran&s;lation, and <HI>induces them to pay too great an attention to the</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="26">
<HI>beck of a mini&s;ter.</HI> This is a con&s;ideration of your lord&s;hip's &s;tarting, and of which I am follower and not leader: I hope to treat it, notwith&s;tanding, with all becoming de|cency, though I &s;ee no rea&s;on for &s;hrinking from the inve&s;tigation in any particular. Here is a charge, or (if you plea&s;e) a &s;u&s;|picion of &s;ecularity and corruption of prin|ciple in the &s;piritual lords, &s;tated in the way of argument by one of the bench, as a motive for levelling their revenues, for the purpo&s;e among&s;t others, of removing out of &s;ight the tempting lure of a tran&s;lation, by which any one or more of the bi&s;hops may be in|duced to follow <HI>the beck of a mini&s;ter.</HI> This ob&s;ervation met you in the academic groves of Cambridge, for your own experience of their lord&s;hips in parliament, at the time of writ|ing this pamphlet, could not well have fur|ni&s;hed you with foundation either for adopt|ing or rejecting the imputation. It is worthy ob&s;ervation, that you &s;tate the influence as operating, to no other evil bia&s;s than that of following <HI>the beck of a mini&s;ter.</HI> It is the crime of &s;upporting his Maje&s;ty's govern|ment, not that of following any factious leader into oppo&s;ition, that your lord&s;hip levels at;

and yet if we are, for the &s;ake of argument, to &s;uppo&s;e the bench of bi&s;hops &s;ubject to be corrupted in their parliamentary duty by the expectation of tran&s;lations, that expecta|tion may in many ca&s;es be derived from the leaders in oppo&s;ition, as well as from the mini&s;ters in immediate office. The tran&s;i|tions of power in our government have been &s;o frequent, that worldly-minded men are as likely to <HI>oppo&s;e</HI> out of motives of &s;elf|intere&s;t, as they are to <HI>&s;upport.</HI> You have therefore either overlooked this part of the danger, or you think it no danger at all; yet I am unwilling to believe that you think every man who oppo&s;es a mini&s;ter, gives an unequivocal proof to the world, that he does it with a clear con&s;cience, and acts for the good of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>There is another &s;pecies of parliamentary attachment (to give it no harder name) which you either had not in contemplation, or have not taken any mea&s;ures to prevent; and this is, the partiality of gratitude, the political attachment, which &s;ome are &s;u&s;|pected to have to their patrons and benefac|tors. I can hardly per&s;uade my&s;elf that, in your commerce with mankind, you have
<PB N="26" REF="28">
taken up that unfriendly opinion, which gives them no credit for the principle of gra|titude; and yet your &s;cheme makes no pro|vi&s;ion again&s;t the attachments that may be &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e from it. Can a lord &s;piri|tual act in political concert with a lord tem|poral, for no other rea&s;on but the expecta|tion of future promotion on the bench? May he not be &s;u&s;pected of following the mea&s;ures, and &s;upporting the politics, of his friend, in gratitude for promotion pa&s;t? And if he follows <HI>the beck of any man,</HI> is he not equally a follower, whether the man who <HI>beckons</HI> to him be a mini&s;ter, or the oppo|nent of a mini&s;ter? Is not the &s;tate robbed of his free opinion and advice in both ca&s;es alike?</P>
<P>It mu&s;t occur, from the nature of things, that many &s;piritual lords enter parliament with connexions very apt to give a bia&s;s to the human mind: &s;ome of them will be found to be the cadets of noble families; &s;ome al|lied by marriage or otherwi&s;e, to men in power and office; &s;ome are advanced to the bench by particular patrons; and in&s;tances will occur, of bi&s;hops who owe their eleva|tion to tho&s;e who have been their pupils, and
<PB N="27" REF="29">
for whom they have contracted habits of attachment, little &s;hort of parental affection. It is not within the compa&s;s of human wit to invent a regulation to re&s;train the influ|ence that will be apt to &s;pring from the&s;e connexions. The propo&s;als &s;ugge&s;ted by your lord&s;hip have nothing of this &s;ort in view; and I mu&s;t beg you to ob&s;erve, that they are framed to no other purpo&s;e than that of di&s;abling the lords &s;piritual from fol|lowing impul&s;es of the ba&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t mer|cenary &s;ort; impul&s;es, &s;uppo&s;ed to re&s;ult from the &s;ordid principle of &s;elling their con&s;ciences to a mini&s;ter, in the hope of ob|taining promotions in the &s;acred function to which they belong. In&s;tances of this de|&s;cription may have exi&s;ted, to the di&s;grace of the church; but let any &s;erious and expe|rienced per&s;on que&s;tion him&s;elf ingenuou&s;ly on the &s;ubject, and, I am certain, he will acknowledge, that for one example, where he can fix the imputation alluded to by your lord&s;hip, many will occur to his recollection of the nature I point at, and for which your &s;cheme makes no provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion therefore, as far as it re&s;pects the <HI>&s;ecularity</HI> of the bench, turns upon this
<PB N="28" REF="30">
&s;ingle point&mdash;whether it is worth while to re|ver&s;e the e&s;tabli&s;hed order of the epi&s;copal re|venues, and reduce the incomes of Winche&s;|ter and Sali&s;bury, for in&s;tance, though di&s;tin|gui&s;hed with the in&s;ignia of the Garter, to the level of Landaff and Bangor, and to equalize the epi&s;copal palatine of Durham with Sodor and Man, for the purpo&s;e of pre|venting tho&s;e inferior prelates from an act of ba&s;ene&s;s, which it is to be pre&s;umed is not, and will not be in their contemplation; and which, after all, if it does, or ever &s;hall exi&s;t in the per&s;ons of &s;uch prelates, cannot be remedied by the &s;cheme recommended by your lord&s;hip, or by any other &s;cheme with|in the reach of man's invention. Why &s;hould we not conclude, that the language which flows from your lord&s;hip's pen, pa&s;&s;es in other men's hearts in the &s;ame predicament with you? <HI>I &s;hould think my&s;elf utterly un|worthy the favour I have received from his Maje&s;ty, and the &s;acred office to which I have been appointed, if either fear of offending, or expectation of plea&s;ing, or any other con&s;idera|tion on earth, could influence me to di&s;gui&s;e my &s;entiments on any &s;ubject of civil or religious importance.</HI> The&s;e are your lord&s;hip's words,

Either you think better of your&s;elf than you do of your brethren, or you are propo&s;ing regulations upon a rea&s;on that has no foundation.

It might indeed be prudent not to attack the

mitre till you had one on your own head; but it &s;urely was not a prudence, which aro&s;e from re&s;pect to the bench, from can|dour towards others, or humility with re|&s;pect to your&s;elf. Your own character you have di&s;played to the world in colours of the mo&s;t &s;elf-flattering ca&s;t; your brethren you have &s;hadowed in the darke&s;t tints of meanne&s;s and corruption. If you had com|municated your propo&s;als to the bi&s;hops, or &s;ubmitted them in your place to the legi&s;la|ture, in &s;hort, if you had cho&s;en any other method, or any other time and &s;tation in your life, than you have now cho&s;en for publi&s;hing the&s;e opinions, the invidious part of them might have been avoided; the bene|ficial (if there is any part that an&s;wers to the idea) might have been as effectually re|commended. Shall we &s;uppo&s;e your lord|&s;hip to have been actuated by worldly views in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the&s;e opinions, whil&s;t you was a candidate for the mitre? that would be to call in que&s;tion the veracity of your decla|ration, and to &s;uppo&s;e you capable of being influenced by <HI>the fear of offending,</HI> when you have publicly profe&s;&s;ed from the pre&s;s, that you have a &s;oul &s;uperior to &s;uch &s;ordid in|fluence:

Nay, I &s;hould be warranted in a&s;&s;erting that the allurements, which the crown (or, if you plea&s;e, the mi|ni&s;ter) has to hold out to the judges, are greater than he has to offer to the con&s;ciences of the bi&s;hops; for the peerage, which in the latter in&s;tance is an annexation to the order, in the former ca&s;e is a temptation to enhance the influence of the court above the intere&s;ts of the &s;ubject.

On the contrary, is it not much to their re|putation to be found united in the &s;upport of his Maje&s;ty's government upon general que&s;tions of civil import, and not &s;plitting and dividing into petty factions upon every contentious matter that oppo&s;ition &s;tarts, in its determined animo&s;ity again&s;t mini&s;try. I hope my words will not be carried further
<PB N="39" REF="43">
than they mean. Few men in my &s;phere of life have le&s;s cau&s;e to confide in mini&s;ters, and none, I hope, have more occa&s;ion to la|ment the having tru&s;ted them, and &s;erved them. I hope there will ever be found wi&s;e men to watch them, good men to oppo&s;e them, and re&s;olute men to puni&s;h them: but I would have no men teaze them or cripple them for mi&s;chief's &s;ake; and lea&s;t of all would I have &s;uch a &s;pirit of ob&s;truc|tion find a place within a bi&s;hop's bo&s;om. Upon the vacancy of Canterbury, more than one prelate was found, who declined the offer of the primacy of all England; and a bi&s;hop has been rai&s;ed to that high &s;tation, who owes his elevation to his merit. Though it would be a very plea&s;ing ta&s;k to &s;peak of every individual of a bench &s;o re&s;pectably fil|led as the pre&s;ent, I forbear to &s;tate further particulars, for rea&s;ons too obvious to need an explanation.</P>
<P>Taking it for granted, that the bi&s;hops are under the influence of the crown, your lord|&s;hip infers, that this bill will tend to le&s;&s;en that influence; and you enter upon a &s;pecu|lative di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the many evil con&s;e|quences incident to &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of govern|ment.
<PB N="40" REF="44">
In doing this, you guard the public from &s;u&s;pecting that you have any wi&s;h at heart of lowering the legal prerogative, or of &s;eeing a preponderation in the people's or nobles &s;cale of the con&s;titution over that of the monarch. It is again&s;t that part only of the regal influence your wi&s;hes point, that extends it&s;elf to the deliberations of the he|reditary coun&s;ellors of the crown, or the parliamentary repre&s;entatives of the people; and you in&s;tance the late pernicious effects of that influence, by who&s;e predominancy for a cour&s;e of years, <HI>the brighte&s;t jewel of his Maje&s;ty's crown is now become tarni&s;hed, and the &s;tronge&s;t limb of the Briti&s;h empire rudely &s;evered from its parent &s;tock.</HI> This in|&s;tance, without doubt, refers to the conduct of the late war re&s;pecting America; which began with the revolt, and terminated in the lo&s;s of the colonies. Your lord&s;hip imputes all the&s;e misfortunes to the influence of the crown over the deliberations of its public coun&s;ellors; which, if they had been left free and unbia&s;&s;ed, would have produced &s;uch mea&s;ures, as in the end had prevented tho&s;e misfortunes you deplore.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="45">
Weak or wicked mu&s;t be that &s;overeign, and unworthy to be called the father of his people, who a&s;&s;igns over his influence to a mini&s;ter for the crooked purpo&s;e of forcing mea&s;ures upon a parliament again&s;t the in|tere&s;ts and the judgement of his &s;ubjects. This is the implication of your lord&s;hip's charge, and a very &s;erious one it is. Not con|tent to attack with plain pro&s;e, you draw the weapon of the drama on this occa&s;ion, and quote the following lines, viz.</P>
<Q><L>It is the cur&s;e of kings, to be attended</L>
<L>By &s;laves, who take their humours for a warrant,</L>
<L>And who, to be endeared to a king,</L>
<L>Make it no con&s;cience to de&s;troy his honour.</L></Q>
<P>This quotation follows your prote&s;t again&s;t the fatal predominancy of the crown's in|fluence in the late in&s;tance of the American war: your application therefore is too pointed to be mi&s;taken. If you had painted the mini&s;ter as the tyrant over the king, the king, being a &s;lave, had not been re&s;pon&s;ible for the abu&s;e of his influence; but your quo|tation
<PB N="42" REF="46">
&s;tates the king to be the tyrant, and the mini&s;ter the &s;lave, who takes <HI>his hu|mours for a warrant.</HI> Your's is an unqua|lified accu&s;ation; I may add, it is al&s;o an unprovoked one; for it was not by nece&s;&s;ity that the reduction of the bi&s;hopricks &s;hould lead you to the revolt of America: neither would it have been any impeachment to your di&s;cretion, after the recent bounty of the crown, if you had &s;pared your bene|factor.</P>
<P>Permit me to add&mdash;as your lord&s;hip has helped us to the example of St. Chry&s;o&s;tom for &s;leeping with an Ari&s;tophanes under his pillow, and given us the above quotation from the drama after his example, it may not be impertinent in me to offer another pa&s;&s;age from the &s;tage, though I do not ven|ture to recommend you to put it like a bridal cake under your pillow, as it might chance to &s;et you a dreaming. It runs pretty nearly in the &s;ame words with the pa&s;&s;age you have &s;elected, though not from the &s;ame author; viz.</P>
<Q><PB N="43" REF="47">
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;It is the cur&s;e of kings to be in&s;ulted</Q></P>

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;And who, to be endeared to the people,</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Make it no con&s;cience to arraign their ma&s;ter.&endq;</Q></P></Q>
<P>I &s;hall not enter far into this que&s;tion with your lord&s;hip, becau&s;e you have &s;tarted it in the mo&s;t unfavourable moment for its agi|tation. There needed not your lord&s;hip's authority for imputing the misfortunes of this fatal war to the influence of the &s;ove|reign; the emi&s;&s;aries of America have re|ported this inflammatory doctrine, and echoed it in her ears repeatedly: the incen|diaries of England have circulated it; but rea&s;on, truth, and loyalty reject the hateful a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>You have &s;tirred a que&s;tion, my lord bi|&s;hop, too complicated to be under&s;tood, ex|cept by tho&s;e who are furni&s;hed with an in|timate knowledge of the proceedings, with great impartiality, and acute di&s;cernment. The lea&s;t that can be &s;aid, is, that in thus pronouncing on the fact you have <HI>begged the que&s;tion</HI> in &s;ome very material points. And
<PB N="44" REF="48">
fir&s;t I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, before it can be pro|nounced that the &s;eparation of America was owing to the predominancy of his Maje&s;ty's influence over the two hou&s;es of parliament, it &s;hould be proved that the revolt was owing to it: this alone, my lord, would be a di&s;qui&s;ition that no man could manage without complete official information. It is not <HI>inter &s;ylvas academi,</HI> this point can be properly &s;ifted; it is not within the re&s;earches of erudition, or the &s;peculations of literary theori&s;ts, to decide upon this po&s;ition: it mu&s;t turn upon hi&s;torical evidences; and the&s;e can be known only by men who have been intimately conver&s;ant in the affairs of the colonies from times long pa&s;t. Events of notoriety all men of ob&s;ervation will agree upon; but nice attention mu&s;t be paid to the leading cau&s;es of tho&s;e events, el&s;e we &s;hould &s;pend our words in the air without any fixt object of controver&s;y. If there was a pre|meditation of revolt, whether that preme|ditation was or was not precipitated into overt acts of revolt by the mi&s;conduct of government, &s;till it cannot be pronounced that the colonies would not have been &s;e|vered from the empire, though the influence
<PB N="45" REF="49">
of the crown had not been unduly exerted to corrupt the judgement of the legi&s;lature. If there was an original independant motive for attempting the &s;eparation, we may di&s;|pute upon the propriety or impropriety of the means pur&s;ued for fru&s;trating that at|tempt; but we cannot fairly pronounce that it would not have been carried through but for the in&s;ufficiency and unfitne&s;s of tho&s;e means. How does it appear that the war with America was not the war of the people, but of the king and his mini&s;ters? If your lord|&s;hip cannot prove that there was no nece&s;|&s;ity for <HI>coercion,</HI> the point in que&s;tion will re&s;t between the deliberative and the execu|tive &s;ervants of the public; and, though you have thought proper to decide again&s;t the mini&s;ter only, others may have &s;ome|thing to oppo&s;e in extenuation of your &s;en|tence. In &s;hort, a thou&s;and dubious points pre&s;ent them&s;elves to a di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate enquirer, which mu&s;t all be cleared away, and made to &s;tand in charge again&s;t the mini&s;ter, before you can with ju&s;tice place to his account, and to the evil influence of the crown, the revolt and lo&s;s of the American colonies.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to prove that the colonies never
<PB N="46" REF="50">
meditated a revolt from the mother country; that, if they did, human prudence could have dictated means for it's prevention; that the mea&s;ures which were taken, were taken again&s;t the &s;en&s;e and conviction of the ma|jority of the legi&s;lature, and over-ruled by the uncon&s;titutional influence of the crown; and la&s;tly, that the exertions called forth from the nation by the mini&s;ter, and by him com|mitted to the executive agents, were in fact &s;o mi&s;calculated and inadequate, that they mu&s;t have failed, though managed with the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible addre&s;s and ability in ope|ration. Men are &s;ubject to errors in action, as well as errors in judgement: of the for|mer you make no account, to the latter you impute the whole. Demon&s;trate, therefore, that no misfortunes are imputable to the exe|cutive conductors of the war, or prove that the deliberative conductors were &s;o erroneous, that the like misfortunes mu&s;t have en&s;ued from mere nece&s;&s;ity, and without mi&s;manage|ment in point of operation. When this is done, you will bring the charge completely home to the mini&s;ter; and, having e&s;tabli&s;h|ed this po&s;tulatum to your &s;atisfaction, you mu&s;t convince your readers that the &s;en&s;e of
<PB N="47" REF="51">
parliament was again&s;t the mea&s;ure, and that the crown by its influence overruled and per|verted the better judgement of the legi&s;la|ture. This is a que&s;tion that cannot be de|cided by any one man's decree; hi&s;torians it is to be hoped will faithfully record the facts, and po&s;terity will give judgement when pa&s;&s;ion is extinct.</P>
<P>Your lord&s;hip has declared your&s;elf in the following words, viz. <HI>Not one jot of the legal prerogative did I ever wi&s;h to &s;ee aboli&s;hed.&mdash;</HI>All good men, anxious for the maintenance of our civil liberties, will accord to this wi&s;h. Times have been, when the royal prerogative was a topic held to be too &s;acred in its nature to be profaned by the di&s;cu&s;&s;ions of a &s;ubject. Elizabeth told her parliaments to forbear di&s;cour&s;ing upon matters of &s;tate; that they <HI>ought not to deal, to judge, or to meddle with her prerogative royal.</HI> King James, with a pedantic circumlocution &s;uitable to his character, laid it down as a propo&s;ition in his &s;peeches, that <HI>as it is athei&s;m and bla&s;|phemy in a creature to di&s;pute what the Deity may do, &s;o it is pre&s;umption and &s;edition in a &s;ubject to di&s;pute what a king may do in the height of his power; good Chri&s;tians will be</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="52">
<HI>content with God's will, revealed in his word; and good &s;ubjects will re&s;t in the king's will, revealed in his law.</HI> We now hold a lan|guage more &s;uitable to our con&s;titution, and the limits of regal authority are defined, canva&s;&s;ed, and laid down with preci&s;ion. Farther to contract and narrow the&s;e limits, would be to de&s;troy the equipoi&s;e of our con&s;titution and throw it from its hinges. The object which modern patrioti&s;m views with jealou&s;y, is the <HI>influence</HI> of the crown; whether regulations lately enforced have cir|cum&s;cribed this <HI>influence</HI> &s;ufficiently, or too much, time will di&s;cover, without my pre|&s;uming to obtrude an in&s;ignificant opinion. Hone&s;t men cannot differ in their &s;entiments upon the principle of political corruption; they mu&s;t unite in abhorring the idea. But to conceive that government will be carried on by the loo&s;e opinions and advice of extra-official members of council or parliament, may be a very pretty &s;peculation <HI>inter &s;ylvas academi,</HI> but will never hold in practice. The hired &s;ervants of the crown mu&s;t do the bu&s;ine&s;s of the crown: if a mini&s;ter &s;hall attempt to govern by the opinions of the public, this country will &s;oon be found in
<PB N="49" REF="53">
a &s;tate of anarchy and confu&s;ion: reduced as the king's prerogative now is, his in|fluence in the &s;tate &s;hould be touched with a very tender hand, otherwi&s;e it may prove, that whil&s;t we think we are lopping off only the rotten branches of corruption, we may find to our co&s;t that we have de&s;troyed the root and &s;ap of the tree: the vigour and energy of execution mu&s;t be left entire, and in which of the three branches that exi&s;ts we need not be reminded. The knife perhaps has pruned too deep already; if this be &s;o, the con&s;equences will be &s;oon apparent: and the&s;e will be, a turbulent interference of the people; intemperate alterations in the con|&s;titution under &s;pecious titles of reform; quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of admini&s;tration; &s;ece&s;&s;ion and revolt from office, and a dread of re&s;pon|&s;ibility in men of &s;tation and experience; &s;udden elevation of new people, whom cla|mour rai&s;es into con&s;equence, and de&s;peration forces upon undertakings above their ta|lents, their condition, or experience; every revolution of the mini&s;try will be an arrant &s;cramble for office, and as few can be fed, though all will be hungry, the mouths that are left empty, will be left open, and loude&s;t

in the cry of di&s;content. The tenure of office being rendered vague and fugitive, men will plunder with rapacity what they po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of by violence; like tenants warn|ed from a lea&s;e, they will rack the &s;oil for a crop, convinced they &s;hall not wait the &s;ow|ing of another; or, to borrow an allu&s;ion from your lord&s;hip's publication now before me, they will treat their places with that kind of neglect, which your plan imputes to bi&s;hops in inferior &s;ees; and con&s;ider them only as the &s;tepping-&s;tones of ambition, and baiting-places in the road to preferment.</P>
<P>When this turns out to be the ca&s;e, it will appear that tho&s;e mi&s;taken mea&s;ures, which were taken on the plea of preventives again&s;t corruption, have ultimately been the pro|moters of it, and that by reducing the in|fluence of the crown, they have impaired the vital &s;trength of the &s;tate: when <HI>this</HI> turns out to be the ca&s;e, the &s;taff of office will tremble in each hand that holds it; the &s;overeign will find him&s;elf &s;urrounded by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of faces new to the court, and his body under guard of tho&s;e, who are even &s;trangers to his per&s;on. A king without in|fluence will have a mini&s;ter without power,
<PB N="51" REF="57">
and an impotent mini&s;ter will make an im|potent nation. The great earl of Chatham &s;aid, <HI>he quitted councils which he could no longer guide;</HI> the language indeed was high, but it was the language of efficiency: a &s;hort time will &s;how whether the&s;e are con&s;e|quences to be apprehended, or not. Upon the whole, I &s;ee no demon&s;trative rea&s;on to accu&s;e the bi&s;hops of worldly-minded mo|tives, becau&s;e in general they &s;upport the mea&s;ures of the crown; for if oppo&s;ition be, as &s;ome men believe, the re&s;ult of party, and a &s;truggle for civil employment, the bi&s;hops, who have no civil employment to &s;truggle for, have not tho&s;e motives for oppo&s;ing as the temporal peers have, and will of cour&s;e in general divide with government, though you could level their revenues with &s;uch nicety, as to leave no preference in the choice of preferments, that might influence the con&s;ciences even of the mo&s;t pliant.</P>
<P>Another probable con&s;equence of the pro|po&s;ed plan, is &s;tated by your lord&s;hip to be, the <HI>longer</HI> re&s;idence of the bi&s;hops in their re&s;pective dioce&s;es. By <HI>longer</HI> re&s;idence, it is to be pre&s;umed you mean <HI>longer</HI> in pro|portion to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or in other words,
<PB N="52" REF="58">
clo&s;er and more con&s;tant re&s;idence: and you moreover think, <HI>they would be induced to ren|der their places of re&s;idence more comfortable and commodious.</HI> This opinion merits &s;ome examination.</P>
<P>In all duties and profe&s;&s;ions, men require &s;ome &s;pur to quicken their exertions for the at|tainment of excellence in their particular vo|cations; in other words, they mu&s;t be rou&s;ed by emulation, and the pro&s;pect of ri&s;ing to more di&s;tingui&s;hed honours and advantages than they already enjoy: &s;hut this pro&s;pect, and their ardour cools. Every man's ex|perience in life confirms this ob&s;ervation; it does not want to be explained, and it can|not be di&s;puted. Rewards in&s;pire a zeal for virtuous attainments, as puni&s;hments deter from the commi&s;&s;ion of evil deeds. Tell a man he is at the end of his race, that he has nothing further to contend for, and he runs no further, he contends no longer; he &s;inks into the languor of content, or ru&s;ts in &s;ul|lenne&s;s and negligence. It appears to me that your lord&s;hip's propo&s;al is open to this general objection, that it is calculated to ex|tingui&s;h that degree of emulation, which is created by the hope of profit and promotion.
<PB N="53" REF="59">
That you can &s;uppo&s;e a bi&s;hop &s;ubject to be acted upon by the&s;e motives is evi|dent, from your apprehen&s;ion of their being influenced by the crown, the fountain of honours: grant only that the crown is capable of be&s;towing honours according to de&s;ert (and your lord&s;hip cannot well deny what your own example proves) you admit my rea&s;oning in its utmo&s;t force of objection. Reduce the bi&s;hops to the level condition of a convent of monks, you render them at once a &s;warm of drones; and whether they &s;leep within or without the pale of their own dioce&s;e will be a matter of &s;mall con|cern. As the ca&s;e now &s;tands, if a young a&s;piring prelate enters a new dioce&s;e, he looks around him for occa&s;ions of di&s;tin|gui&s;hing him&s;elf; his zeal communicates it|&s;elf to the &s;ubordinate clergy that fall with|in his notice; they look up to him as a ri&s;ing man, and &s;trive to recommend them&s;elves by peculiar a&s;&s;iduity and good conduct; thus life and &s;pirit circulate from his center, and his ambition gives a &s;pring to all around it: the contrary to this mu&s;t happen, if your lord&s;hip's regulations were adopted. Ex|amine how it &s;tands in other callings and profe&s;&s;ions. Tell the clerk in office, he is
<PB N="54" REF="60">
at the utmo&s;t of his earnings, and you will &s;oon find him at the end of his exertions; if he drudges through his daily ta&s;k, 'tis as much as you can look for; change the &s;cene before him, by holding out the hope of ad|vancement, and he becomes alert. In the military profe&s;&s;ion 'tis the expectation of <HI>a &s;tep;</HI> 'tis <HI>young ambition's ladder</HI> that &s;ets men to climbing: convince him that he has no more to look to, and, like <HI>Lucullus's &s;oldier&mdash;po&s;thaec ille catus.</HI> <Q>Tis a coar&s;e and vulgar &s;aying, but a good one, that &startq;new brooms &s;weep clean.&endq;</Q> And if ever I &s;hould hear of any attempts to alter and reform the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed church, I would ri&s;que a gue&s;s that it originates with &s;ome young a&s;piring pre|late, hot in zeal and new in office, who, by correcting others, wants to &s;ignalize him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>As to that part of your lord&s;hip's expecta|tion, which &s;uppo&s;es that the bi&s;hops under your bill would &s;et about improving their places of re&s;idence and rendering them more comfortable and commodious, I believe the very rever&s;e would inevitably follow. Many of the wealthy bi&s;hopricks are endowed with &s;tately palaces, erected and maintained at
<PB N="55" REF="61">
great expence, and &s;everal with pluralities of man&s;ions, which, upon your propo&s;ed &s;cale, could not be kept up, much le&s;s improved by their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. How would the reduced bi&s;hops of Winche&s;ter, Durham, London, Worce&s;ter, &amp;c. be able upon their revenues to &s;upport &s;uch expen&s;ive palaces in any decent condition? and who but would &s;hun a bi&s;hoprick &s;o encumbered, unle&s;s he was a man of independent fortune?</P>
<P>Upon a review of this argument, it ap|pears in the fir&s;t place doubtful, if your lord&s;hip's propo&s;ed bill would induce the bi&s;hops to a clo&s;er re&s;idence. In the &s;econd place, I hold it certain, that, if it did, they would re&s;ide in their dioce&s;es with infinitely le&s;s effect than they do at pre&s;ent, for the rea|&s;ons above given. And in the la&s;t place, it is a contradiction in terms to &s;uppo&s;e that a bi|&s;hop will maintain and improve his place of re&s;idence upon a reduced income, better than he will upon an extended one.</P>
<P>As your lord&s;hip profe&s;&s;es a di&s;inclination from &s;pending any further time in delineat|ing a &s;cheme, <HI>which either the more compre|hen&s;ive wi&s;dom, or the more efficient prejudices of other men, may qua&s;h at once,</HI> I &s;hall al&s;o

decline any further remarks, though very many occur in objection to the propo&s;al. It may not be ami&s;s however to premi&s;e, that I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to come back again to the con&s;ideration of this <HI>levelling bill,</HI> in the cour&s;e of my remarks upon your lord&s;hip's &s;econd propo&s;ition.</P>
<P>This propo&s;ition your lord&s;hip &s;tates to be for the introduction of a bill into parlia|ment, <HI>for appropriating, as they become va|cant, one third, or &s;ome other definite part of the income of every deanery, prebend, or ca|nonry, of the churches of We&s;tmin&s;ter, Wind&s;or, Chri&s;t Church, Canterbury, Worce&s;ter, Dur|ham, Norwich, Ely, Peterborough, Carli&s;le, &amp;c. to the &s;ame purpo&s;es, mutatis mutandis, as the fir&s;t-fruits and tenths were appropriated by the act pa&s;&s;ed in the fifth of Queen Anne.</HI> You ob&s;erve that this mu&s;t be done with the &s;pecial con&s;ent of the crown, many of the &s;aid preferments being in his Maje&s;ty's gift; by this I pre&s;ume is meant the <HI>previous</HI> con|&s;ent of the crown, which it will certainly be nece&s;&s;ary in the fir&s;t in&s;tance to obtain, and to &s;tate in the bill.</P>
<P>Having &s;tated the purport of your bill to his Grace of Canterbury, your lord&s;hip pro|ceeds

to addre&s;s him in the following words: <HI>This propo&s;al will, I am &s;en&s;ible, be very diffe|rently received by different &s;orts of men;</HI> SOME <HI>will con&s;ider it as an attack upon the hierarchy, as tending to lower the church e&s;tabli&s;hment;</HI> OTHERS <HI>will think that it does not go far enough, they will prefer levelling to lowering, the abolition of deans and chapters to their re|duction. So much may rea&s;onably be &s;aid on both &s;ides, that I cannot on this occa&s;ion &s;top to &s;ay any thing on either &s;ide; and my bu&s;ine&s;s indeed is not &s;o much with deans and chapters, as with a very u&s;eful, with what</HI> SOME <HI>will not &s;cruple to call the mo&s;t u&s;eful part of the clergy&mdash;the parochial clergy.</HI></P>
<P>This, my lord, is a very extraordinary pa&s;&s;age in many particulars, and demands a more minute examination than I would ge|nerally wi&s;h to give to what your lord&s;hip has thought fit to publi&s;h.</P>
<P>You tell the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury that you are &s;en&s;ible <HI>&s;ome</HI> people will con|&s;ider your propo&s;al as an attack upon the hierarchy; <HI>others</HI> will think it ought to be extended to the abolition of deans and chap|ters: in &s;hort, that the whole public (in|cluded under the oppo&s;ite di&s;tinctions of

You &s;tate two orders of people in the extremes of opinion touching your propo&s;al; each of them ad|ver&s;e to the mea&s;ure of your bill.

Your right reverend brethren al&s;o may well be &s;uppo&s;ed to hold the fir&s;t opinion; and probably the good metropolitan, now de|cea&s;ed, to whom your pamphlet is addre&s;&s;ed, was of that way of thinking.</P>
<P>Let us con&s;ider how your lord&s;hip treats the&s;e opinions, which you have &s;tated to the archbi&s;hop as being adver&s;e to your pro|po&s;al. You tell him that &s;o much may rea|&s;onably be &s;aid on both &s;ides, that you can|not on this occa&s;ion &s;top to &s;ay any thing on either &s;ide. This is a &s;ingular mode of treating the per&s;on you write to, and the &s;ubject you write upon. You addre&s;s the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury by a printed pam|phlet, propo&s;ing to him a very important alteration in the church e&s;tabli&s;hment; you tell him that <HI>&s;ome</HI> people object to your propo&s;al as going too far, <HI>other</HI> peo|ple object to it as not going far enough, that there is much rea&s;on on both &s;ides, and on that very account you cannot &s;top to &s;ay any thing to his Grace on either &s;ide. Had the objections been trifling or contemptible, you might have &s;o di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them; nay, you might more probably have forborn to &s;tate them at all; but this is not the ca&s;e, even
<PB N="60" REF="66">
by your own confe&s;&s;ion. 'Tis more than pro|bable, as I before ob&s;erved, that your bre|thren of the bench are included in one of the&s;e two cla&s;&s;es, and yet you cannot or you will not &s;top to an&s;wer their objections. Is this fair to your &s;ubject; is it re&s;pectful to your corre&s;pondent? Is the topick upon which you write, a matter of &s;mall con&s;e|quence to church or &s;tate, that you &s;hould run from it in &s;uch a hurry? And what &s;pe|cies of hurry is this, which gives you time to object, and leaves you none to defend? What kind of avocations are the&s;e, which allow you lei&s;ure to &s;tart difficulties, and none to tell us how tho&s;e difficulties may be got rid of? You do not come out by com|pul&s;ion as a reformer of the church e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, you are a volunteer in the office. If you had taken a little more time and ex|perience of your new dignity; if you had con&s;ulted your brethren, and ripened tho&s;e ideas, which you conceived <HI>inter &s;ylvas aca|demi,</HI> by the conver&s;ation of men of bu|&s;ine&s;s and of practice in the &s;tate, with whom your elevation now enables you to commu|nicate, the world would not have reproached you for indolence in office; and if you had
<PB N="61" REF="67">
then thought fit to have printed your pro|po&s;als for the reform of the e&s;tabli&s;hment at large, or of that order in particular to which you per&s;onally belong, tho&s;e propo&s;als would not have been the le&s;s mature in judgement, the le&s;s re&s;pectful to the public, or the le&s;s becoming of your&s;elf, if they had appeared after due deliberation and experience, &s;eri|ou&s;ly weighed and fully explained. In few words, my lord, I conceive nobody would have thought you had been too late in time, though you had been le&s;s in a hurry; nor would any one have found fault with your indolence, though you had delayed publi&s;h|ing till you under&s;tood your &s;ubject.</P>
<P>In the pa&s;&s;age above quoted, you are plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that your bu&s;ine&s;s is not &s;o much with deans and chapters, as with a <HI>very u&s;eful part</HI> of the clergy, the parochial clergy. If I could &s;uppo&s;e your lord&s;hip ca|pable of a leaning to tho&s;e opinions, which are for the abolition of deans and chapters, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e it from this pa&s;&s;age; in which you plainly and pointedly di&s;tin|gui&s;h the deans and chapters from what you call the <HI>u&s;eful part</HI> of the clergy. I would not force a meaning on you that is not your
<PB N="62" REF="68">
own; but what other interpretation will this pa&s;&s;age bear, but that it is with <HI>the u&s;e|ful part</HI> of the clergy, and not with the deans and chapters, you concern your&s;elf? And yet I &s;hould be humbly of opinion, when you take property from one man and give it to another, you have equal bu&s;ine&s;s with both; it would not be ea&s;y to convince the lo&s;ing party, or any party, of the con|trary; the thing &s;peaks for it&s;elf: and I am apt to think it is rather a conci&s;e way of dealing with any order of men, to &s;ugge&s;t propo&s;als for &s;tripping them of their incomes, and then di&s;mi&s;s them by &s;aying, that your bu&s;ine&s;s does not lie with them, but with <HI>the very u&s;eful people</HI> to whom you be&s;tow the plunder of their revenues.</P>
<P>Not content with thus di&s;tingui&s;hing the devoted deans and chapters from <HI>the very u&s;eful</HI> parochial clergy, you go on to &s;ay, that <HI>&s;ome</HI> people will not &s;cruple to call the &s;aid parochial clergy <HI>the mo&s;t u&s;eful</HI> part of the whole body. Here you find a word to fling at your brethren the bi&s;hops, and, by ca&s;ting my eye back a few pages in your pamphlet, <HI>&s;ome</HI> people &s;tare me again in the face, who are for driving the bi&s;hops out of
<PB N="63" REF="69">
the hou&s;e of lords. The pa&s;&s;age is as fol|lows: <HI>Some, I doubt not, will be ready enough to think that the &s;tate would receive little in|jury by the perpetual ab&s;ence of the bi&s;hops from the hou&s;e of lords.</HI> 'Tis well for the&s;e <HI>&s;ome</HI> peo|ple, <HI>who are &s;o ready to think</HI> of the bi&s;hops expul&s;ion, that they have found a man <HI>&s;o ready to &s;peak of it.</HI> I &s;u&s;pect, my lord, that the&s;e <HI>&s;ome folks</HI> are the &s;ame as tho&s;e <HI>other folks,</HI> that prefer the abolition of deans and chapters to their reduction. One thing however is clear, that between the two, our poor church and its e&s;tabli&s;hment are com|pletely di&s;po&s;ed of. Farewell to all its dig|nitaries at once! The &s;chi&s;matics will not &s;ay nay. <HI>The di&s;&s;enting clergy</HI> (whom, &s;ays your lord&s;hip, <HI>I cannot look upon as inferior to the clergy of the e&s;tabli&s;hment, either in learning or morals)</HI> will, I dare &s;ay, repay you the fine compliment you have made them; and when you have effected your re|form, and &s;ignalized your&s;elf as <HI>the great le|veller of the hierarchy,</HI> they will, I hope, ad|mit you to the honour of an equality with that <HI>learned and moral</HI> &s;et of &s;ectaries, who, for good rea&s;ons, no doubt (el&s;e they could not be &s;o learned) and for hone&s;t ones (el&s;e
<PB N="64" REF="70">
they could not be &s;o moral) di&s;&s;ent and &s;e|parate from the e&s;tabli&s;hed church.</P>
<P>My lord, I tell you as your friend, the&s;e are new-fangled tenets and opinions, which, in &s;pite of all the echo of applau&s;e, will not abide the te&s;t of rea&s;on and di&s;cretion, and which your cooler and corrected judgement will in time repent of and condemn.</P>
<P>When objections are &s;tated &s;o frequently, and left unan&s;wered, in a publication, ad|dre&s;&s;ed indeed to the head of the church, but which, in effect, is an appeal to the laity, they are in fact &s;ugge&s;tions, they have all the malice of opinions, and all the mi&s;|chief of authority. What need of bring|ing in the di&s;&s;enting clergy at all? What call for this unnece&s;&s;ary exertion, this vo|luntary parade of candour? Your &s;ubject does not require it; no tittle of your pro|po&s;al points that way, nor does the hurry and precipitation with which you write, ju&s;tify the digre&s;&s;ion. When deans and chap|ters are to be aboli&s;hed, you have no bu&s;ine&s;s with them, you cannot &s;top to &s;ay one word in arre&s;t of their extinction; the &s;cape-goats may peri&s;h in their &s;talls for what you care. So great is your hurry to get through the ta&s;k of reducing them, that if any one thinks
<PB N="65" REF="71">
it better to annihilate them, you have no|thing to &s;ay to the contrary. How comes this hurry in one ca&s;e, to be contra&s;ted by &s;o much lei&s;ure in another? When the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed church is to be cried down, you can|not &s;top to defend it; when the di&s;&s;enting clergy are to be cried up, you can &s;top, and &s;tay the breaking off of your &s;ubject, to hook in their panegyric, though at the expence of a digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>After having &s;tated the purport of your pro|po&s;ed bill, your lord&s;hip proceeds to explain what I &s;uppo&s;e will be a&s;&s;erted in the pream|ble; viz. that the general provi&s;ion for the pa|rochial clergy is inadequate and in&s;ufficient. You ob&s;erve, that the revenue of the church of England is not well under&s;tood, and that <HI>you have met a great many very &s;en&s;ible men of all profe&s;&s;ions and ranks, who did not under&s;tand it:</HI> that the&s;e &s;en&s;ible men have expre&s;&s;ed great &s;urprize at being told by your lord&s;hip that the whole income of the church, in|cluding even the two Univer&s;ities, did not amount, upon the mo&s;t liberal calculation, to 1,500,000 <HI>l.</HI> a year: and that upon this e&s;timate, which you have good rea&s;on to be|lieve to be near the truth, there would not remain to each individual, rating the clergy

at ten thou&s;and, above 150 <HI>l.</HI> a year, &s;uppo&s;|ing that we had <HI>no bi&s;hops to in&s;pect and govern the church; no deaneries, prebends, or canon|ries to &s;timulate the clergy to excel in literary attainments; nor any colleges or univer&s;ities to in&s;truct our youth.</HI> This provi&s;ion, you ob|&s;erve, is &s;o mean and &s;canty, that there can &s;urely be no impropriety in wi&s;hing it to be encrea&s;ed.&mdash;Certainly none; the principle of the bill is laudable; my exceptions are to the provi&s;ions of it. <HI>Apothecaries and attornies,</HI> you ob&s;erve, <HI>make as much by their profe&s;&s;ions, though in very moderate practice; and unle&s;s the &s;tate will be contented with a beggarly and illiterate clergy, too mean and contemptible to do any good, either by precept or example; un|le&s;s it will conde&s;cend to have taylors and cob|lers for its pa&s;tors and teachers, the whole pro|vi&s;ion for the church is as low as it can be.</HI> If there was any intention in the &s;tate to lower the general revenue of the church, this ob|&s;ervation would be more pertinent than it appears to be at pre&s;ent; but if this is not the ca&s;e, and if, on the contrary, the revenue of the church is a ri&s;ing revenue, then where is the occa&s;ion for complaint or apprehen|&s;ion?

cla&s;s of men? Are they too mean and contemptible to do any good by precept or example?

If they are not this beggarly and illiterate race of men (and that they are not, your lord|&s;hip and the whole kingdom will admit) where then is the proof that their revenues are inadequate and in&s;ufficient? Our churches are not &s;erved by <HI>taylors and coblers;</HI> the &s;tate is not purpo&s;ed to lower their revenue; on the contrary, every year brings augmentation to that revenue; whence then does your lord|&s;hip derive that nece&s;&s;ity for encrea&s;ing their incomes, &s;o urgent and immediate as to &s;ug|ge&s;t to you the propo&s;al of taking from the deaneries, prebends, and canonries tho&s;e emoluments, which you your&s;elf acknow|ledge are the very objects that <HI>&s;timulate the clergy to excel in literary attainments?</HI> This is a very extraordinary mode of arguing for the reduction of benefices, by proving the u&s;e of them. Deaneries, &amp;c. &s;timulate our clergy to excel in learning. You propo&s;e to reduce tho&s;e deaneries, &amp;c. fearing that the clergy, if their incomes were lowered, would
<PB N="68" REF="76">
be <HI>taylors and coblers.</HI> By your mode of arguing I might retort, that you would make the deans, prebendaries, and canons <HI>taylors</HI> and <HI>coblers,</HI> to &s;ave the parochial clergy from being &s;uch; and I might a&s;k how &s;uch me|chanic dignitaries would <HI>&s;timulate</HI> to litera|ture: but to &s;ay the truth, I do not like your lord&s;hip's way of rea&s;oning well enough to make u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>A nobler u&s;e you could not find for any department of the clergy, than this which you point out, of giving emulation to the inferior order to excel in erudition and the &s;cience of their own profe&s;&s;ion. How are the&s;e worthy u&s;es brought about, and why do the&s;e dignities in the church <HI>&s;timulate</HI> to eru|dition? By their honour only, or jointly by their honour and emolument? Certainly by joint attraction. Le&s;&s;en tho&s;e emoluments, &s;pread them thinly through the body of the poor parochial clergy, what is the con&s;e|quence? Plainly this, they will either cea&s;e to <HI>&s;timulate,</HI> or <HI>&s;timulate</HI> in a le&s;s degree. The principle of emulation being cru&s;hed, the <HI>literary attainments</HI> will decline in proportion as their encouragements are dimini&s;hed: let it be once more repeated on this occa&s;ion,
<PB N="69" REF="77">
that the &s;ame rea&s;oning applies to the re|duction of the bi&s;hopricks; the bench may &s;till be an object for the inferior clergy to look up to, but it will no longer <HI>&s;timulate</HI> the bi&s;hops them&s;elves to that laudable emu|lation, which gives life to every order and profe&s;&s;ion; and unle&s;s your lord&s;hip is of opinion, that a bi&s;hop, by the act of con&s;e|cration, becomes at once in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all human excellence and perfection <HI>ex officio,</HI> I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that the bench it&s;elf may, like their inferior brethren, profit by the &s;pur of emulation, and owe perhaps &s;ome part of their pre&s;ent merit to that zeal for excelling, which the unequal di&s;tribution of preferment by natural con&s;equence in&s;pires. I would therefore earne&s;tly recommend to your lord&s;hip to recall your a&s;&s;ertion re&s;pect|ing the good effects of deaneries, prebends, and canonries, and before you propo&s;e to re|duce them in value, convict them of inutili|ty; let them be proved <HI>&s;timulatives</HI> to idle|ne&s;s, in&s;tead of <HI>&s;timulatives</HI> to excellence, and you will find your inference follow much ea&s;ier than it does at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>But as your lord&s;hip is unlucky in giving te&s;timony in your own cau&s;e, &s;o you are not
<PB N="70" REF="78">
more fortunate in procuring it. The words of Dr. <HI>Bentley,</HI> which you quote from his <HI>Phileleutherus Lip&s;ien&s;is,</HI> make directly again&s;t your po&s;itions<HI>&mdash;Do but once level all your preferments, and you will &s;oon be as level in your learning.</HI> This is part of the pa&s;&s;age your lord&s;hip has &s;elected in &s;upport of your propo&s;al; which, in the opinion of your own witne&s;s, may as well be called a bill for levelling learning, as for levelling prefer|ments. You have really anticipated me in this quotation, and I know not whether I am mo&s;t obliged to your lord&s;hip for the honour you have done me in my ance&s;tor, or the advantage you have given me in my ar|gument. You have referred your&s;elf to an umpire, to whom, on every account, I wil|lingly &s;ubmit my cau&s;e. Doctor Bentley, in this pa&s;&s;age &s;elected by your lord&s;hip, ex|pre&s;&s;es his wonder why parents &s;hould de|&s;ign their &s;ons for the church, under &s;uch mean encouragements in point of pay, till he recollects that <HI>a few &s;hining dignities in the church, prebends, deaneries, bi&s;hopricks, are the pious fraud that induces and decoys the parents to ri&s;k their children's fortune in it&mdash;</HI>and con|cludes (&s;peaking in the character of a <HI>fo|reigner)</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="79">
that <HI>it is this part of our e&s;tabli&s;hment that makes our clergy excel his:</HI> then follow the words above quoted, viz. <HI>Do but once level all your preferments, and you will &s;oon be as level in your learning: for in&s;tead of the flower of the Engli&s;h youth, you will have only the refu&s;e &s;ent to your academies; and tho&s;e too cramped and crippled in their &s;tudies, for want of aim and emulation; &s;o that if your Free|thinkers had any politics, in&s;tead of &s;uppre&s;|&s;ing your whole order, they &s;hould make you all alike.</HI> Few pa&s;&s;ages can be quoted more in point again&s;t your lord&s;hip's <HI>levelling</HI> propo|&s;als; for though it is true you do not mean to <HI>level</HI> the orders, your bills will operate as if you had: the fir&s;t, by reducing the bi&s;hop|ricks to a very moderate <HI>level,</HI> and throwing out the <HI>commendams;</HI> the &s;econd, by &s;trip|ping the deans and chapters, and di&s;tributing the better part of their income among&s;t the poorer clergy. Dr. Bentley ob&s;erves, that a few &s;hining dignities allure men to the &s;er|vice of the church, as a few glittering prizes tempt adventurers to a &s;tate-lottery; and to the allurements of the&s;e dignities he a&s;cribes all the advantages of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, and the excellence of the clerical character.
<PB N="72" REF="80">
Your lord&s;hip propo&s;es to melt down the&s;e prizes into the gro&s;s &s;um that compounds the &s;mall &s;hares, and con&s;equently mu&s;t maintain a very contrary opinion to the au|thority you quote; for, unle&s;s it can be made appear that a &s;mall augmentation to certain poor livings, by your propo&s;ed di&s;|tribution, will operate as a greater encourage|ment to the profe&s;&s;ion of the church, than the temptation which its undimini&s;hed re|venues now holds forth to adventurers in that profe&s;&s;ion, it will be impo&s;&s;ible to convince mankind of the advantages and good policy of your propo&s;als; nay, in fact, conviction will make directly again&s;t your &s;cheme, as tending to reduce tho&s;e dignities, which Dr. Bentley appo&s;itely ob&s;erves, are the <HI>glitter|ing prizes</HI> which allure our youth, and tho&s;e who have the care of them, to direct their pur&s;uits to the profe&s;&s;ion of the prie&s;t|hood. And what renders your &s;cheme &s;till more objectionable, and even fatal to the in|tere&s;ts and honour of the church, is, that it directly tends to deter the youth of the be&s;t talents, birth, and education, from the pro|fe&s;&s;ion; who certainly will not take orders with a view to fit down upon one of your
<PB N="73" REF="81">
poor livings, though augmented to a bare provi&s;ion with the &s;poils of the dignitaries; whil&s;t at the &s;ame time it invites the mean, the needy, and illiterate, to thru&s;t them&s;elves into a gown, from the a&s;&s;urance of a &s;upport, however &s;canty. It is not therefore with|out good rea&s;on we may venture to predict the declen&s;ion and di&s;grace of the prie&s;t|hood, in the talents and characters of its profe&s;&s;ors, if ever the legi&s;lature &s;hould be &s;o perverted in its judgement, as to adopt a &s;cheme which you too ha&s;tily, and without communicating with your brethren, have laid before the public. Should that ever obtain, <HI>Voe victis! voe victori!</HI> the purer your intentions are in the propo&s;al, the more poignant will be your di&s;appointment and remor&s;e, when you experience its effects.</P>
<P>You &s;ay the revenues of the church ought not to be reduced, and will not, with &s;afety to the e&s;tabli&s;hment, admit of it. I agree with you in the a&s;&s;ertion: the &s;tate has agreed and &s;till agrees. The revenues are not in dan|ger of a reduction, they are annually in ad|vance; a great fund is rolling for their aug|mentation, and a va&s;t &s;um lies ready in hand, at public intere&s;t, waiting for purcha&s;es, and
<PB N="74" REF="82">
accumulating in the mean time. The bounty of Queen Anne has been in operation and re|ceipt near &s;eventy years: but this, with other great re&s;ources, that you have either over|looked or neglected to explain, will de&s;erve a more particular inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>Your lord&s;hip quotes the pa&s;&s;age above referred to from Dr. Bentley, for the purpo&s;e of evincing the inadequacy of the church's preferments. It is true, he &s;peaks of the cheapne&s;s of the prie&s;thood; but he al&s;o &s;ays, that its temptations were &s;ufficient to en|gage men of talents and education in its &s;er|vice. If it was adequate to this purpo&s;e, at the time of his publi&s;hing the <HI>Phileleutherus Lip&s;ien&s;is,</HI> it mu&s;t be much more &s;o at pre|&s;ent, and con&s;equently his te&s;timony, as far as it goes, witne&s;&s;es again&s;t you. As for your lord&s;hip's other quotation from Archbi&s;hop Whitgift, in the time of Queen Elizabeth, as found in Bi&s;hop Kennet's <HI>ca&s;e of impro|priations,</HI> it is much le&s;s in point to prove the pre&s;ent poverty of the church, than this pa&s;&s;age from Dr. Bentley; but neither one nor the other have any thing to do with the ca&s;e in que&s;tion.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="83">
The computations of the number of poor livings, which you collect from Dr. Warner and Dr. Burn, &s;o widely differ from each other, that they only &s;erve to bring calcula|tions of this nature into doubt. The former of the&s;e calculators reckons 6000 livings not above 40 <HI>l.</HI> a year, and he &s;ays he &s;peaks from the be&s;t authority: the latter reckons only 4713 under the &s;ame de&s;cription. Here is a difference of 1287 livings; which are we to believe? When therefore Dr. Warner &s;ays, <HI>that it will be</HI> 500 <HI>years before every living can be rai&s;ed to</HI> 60 l. <HI>a year by Queen Anne's bounty, &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;ame money to be di&s;tri|buted, as there has been for &s;ome years pa&s;t;</HI> and when Dr. Burn a&s;&s;ures us, <HI>that it will be</HI> 339 <HI>years before all the &s;aid livings can ex|ceed</HI> 50 l. <HI>a year,</HI> I think my&s;elf warranted in giving no credit to either of their calcu|lations: but if any man thinks otherwi&s;e, and chu&s;es to adopt either of the&s;e calcula|tions, or to make his own upon the &s;ame premi&s;es, &s;till I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that &s;uch cal|culation will not give any adequate e&s;timate of the future po&s;&s;ible rate of augmentation, becau&s;e no allowance is made for many con|current cau&s;es of augmentation, which come
<PB N="76" REF="84">
in aid of that fund, upon which alone they found their calculations.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e cau&s;es is the benefactions of private patrons, which, in all the ca&s;es of livings under that de&s;cription, keeps pace with the augmentations from Queen Anne's bounty. It &s;hould &s;eem that neither Dr. Warner nor Dr. Burn take the&s;e benefactions into their calculations, which alone mu&s;t make them gro&s;sly erroneous. Dr. Warner grounds his calculation expre&s;sly and &s;olely upon Queen Anne's bounty, &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;ame money to be di&s;tributed as there has been for &s;ome years pa&s;t. This at once de|&s;troys all the evidence of his account, as will hereafter be made appear. Dr. Burn com|putes the clear amount of the bounty to make 55 augmentations yearly, by which terms he expre&s;sly throws out of his account pri|vate benefactions: his calculation therefore is as erroneous as the former. Your lord|&s;hip, &s;en&s;ible of the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of the&s;e mi&s;|calculations, computes <HI>that half of &s;uch aug|mentations may be made in conjunction with other benefactors,</HI> though you think this pro|portion too large; and upon this pre&s;ump|tion you reduce Dr. Burn's calculation of
<PB N="77" REF="85">
339 years to 226 years (of which 70 are nearly expired) before all livings will exceed the &s;aid &s;um of 50 <HI>l.</HI> a year. But what a loo&s;e mode of computing is this! Your lord&s;hip mu&s;t know there are other cau&s;es co-operat|ing for the encrea&s;e of the church revenues, and you mu&s;t be well aware that this method of computing will not give us any thing near the true progre&s;s of the augmentation of livings. As it is no doubt in your power to re&s;ort to the governors of the fund, you might have informed us with preci&s;ion what purcha&s;es have been made in mortmain from the fund in que&s;tion, what &s;ums have been paid in conjunction by private patrons, and (which is another cau&s;e of augmentation you do not touch upon) what beque&s;ts and do|nations have within that period been given in aid to the church. Your lord&s;hip knows, or may know, what the&s;e have actually been; I can only know that they have been too con&s;iderable to be left out of the account. One gentleman of the county of Kent <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Philip Butler.</NOTE>, if I am rightly informed, lately bequeathed the &s;um of twelve thou&s;and pounds to the church: other in&s;tances might be given;

but enough has been &s;aid to &s;hew how &s;hort and erroneous all calculations mu&s;t be that turn &s;ingly upon the operation of Queen Anne's bounty, and how little we can depend upon loo&s;e gue&s;&s;es at private benefactions.</P>
<P>But there is yet another cau&s;e of encrea&s;e, from which the church has already reaped great benefit, and is in train to reap much more. Can it have e&s;caped your lord&s;hip's recollection to &s;tate the great augmentation to livings, which the improvement of lands by inclo&s;ure and otherwi&s;e has occa&s;ioned, particularly in the northern and inland counties, where tho&s;e improvements have mo&s;tly obtained? If this has not in all ca&s;es fallen where your lord&s;hip, and all good men, could wi&s;h it, upon the poore&s;t livings only, &s;till it has fallen to the church, and may contribute as &s;uch to prevent, what your lord&s;hip &s;o piou&s;ly wi&s;hes to prevent, the nece&s;&s;ity of our pulpits being &s;erved by <HI>tay|lors and coblers.</HI> Let the number of inclo&s;|ing acts, pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the year 1714, be rec|koned up, and a calculation taken of the advance made in the incomes of the paro|chial clergy, in con&s;equence of this and other improvements in the value of lands, within
<PB N="79" REF="87">
the period of 70 years, and the augmenta|tion to the church revenues from this cau&s;e alone will be found prodigious. I my&s;elf have met with in&s;tances of livings, that have been augmented by Queen Anne's bounty under one incumbent, rai&s;ed by a &s;ucceeding one to comfortable incomes. New modes of cultivation, and a better &s;y&s;tem of agricul|ture throughout the i&s;land, have improved the value of lands prodigiou&s;ly, and (to u&s;e Lord Chatham's words, as quoted by your lord&s;hip) <HI>the church, God ble&s;s it! has a pit|tance</HI> out of all men's labour, and advances <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> with the &s;tate.</P>
<P>Many other collateral cau&s;es come in aid of the revenues of the church. The many new chapels erected upon private &s;peculation, in the rich and overgrown pari&s;hes of the capital, contribute in no incon&s;iderable de|gree: and in time of war the chaplain&s;hips in our fleets and armies bring a temporary acce&s;&s;ion of revenue, and give employment to very many of the young and enterprizing mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel. The &s;tipends now given by our nobility and gentry of fortune, to the clerical preceptors and tutors of their &s;ons, and the advantages derivable from the
<PB N="80" REF="88">
patronage of tho&s;e families, operate &s;en&s;ibly as general aids and encouragements to the profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Upon examining the &s;tatutes I find, that from 1775 to 1780 inclu&s;ive, which is a pe|riod of &s;ix years only, 342 acts of inclo&s;ure were pa&s;&s;ed; a number far exceeding my gue&s;s, though I was prepared to believe them very numerous. In the la&s;t two years they amounted only to 36; but from the year of Queen Anne's bounty to 1775, I find 841 bills brought in for inclo&s;ures, though of the bills pa&s;&s;ed I did not take the pains to make a correct reckoning. Let any man, who has lei&s;ure and curio&s;ity enough, make the calculation of profit to the church upon the&s;e inclo&s;ing acts, &s;ince the operation of Queen Anne's bounty, and I am &s;ure it will turn out a very con&s;iderable aid; e&s;pecially if it &s;hould appear that church livings in ge|neral have been rai&s;ed in their value propor|tionably to the decrea&s;e upon the value of money throughout the kingdom. Upon this article of inclo&s;ures your lord&s;hip is totally &s;ilent; it makes again&s;t the nece&s;&s;ity of your plan, but I &s;hould hope that was not your rea&s;on for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing it.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="89">
I have already hinted at the <HI>accumulation fund</HI> in the hands of the church, ari&s;ing from the &s;urplu&s;age of the revenue yet undi&s;po&s;ed of in the purcha&s;e of lands. As purcha&s;es can|not in many ca&s;es be found, either from the indi&s;po&s;ition in the land-owners to &s;ell, or from difficulties attending titles (in which the church, perhaps, is nice to an exce&s;s) it has been the prudent oeconomy of the cor|poration, to reduce the intere&s;t to two per cent. only on the money de&s;tined to the augmentation of certain livings, till &s;uch time as the incumbent &s;hall find a purcha&s;e &s;uitable to the purpo&s;e of the church. Hence it has ari&s;en, that a great &s;urplu&s;age has for many years been rolling; which being ve&s;ted in the public funds at full intere&s;t, produces a &s;econdary income, co-operative with the revenue of the fir&s;t-fruits and tenths. Be this fund what it may, the balance of intere&s;t upon intere&s;t is now become part and parcel of Queen Anne's bounty; and it is evident, therefore, that all calculations, formed upon the bare income of the fir&s;t-fruits and tenths, mu&s;t be &s;hort and errone|ous upon the face of them. Dr. Warner and Dr. Burn found their calculations upon

the money actually di&s;tributed for &s;ome years pa&s;t; and now it appears that the money di&s;tributed has, for the above rea&s;ons, &s;o far fallen &s;hort of the money collected by the bounty, and the intere&s;t upon the funded &s;tock, that a va&s;t &s;urplu&s;age has accumulated, as a fund for the future u&s;es of the church, which bids fair, in a &s;hort cour&s;e of time, to rival its parent &s;tock. And in that ca&s;e, it will no doubt be the wi&s;dom of the church, and the wi&s;h of the &s;tate, to put this money to its proper u&s;es, by giving to the poor liv|ings the full amount of the benefit intended for them originally; and as for the &s;urplu|&s;age of intere&s;t above two per cent. which has accumulated in the &s;everal ca&s;es where purcha&s;es could not be found, it will be matter of con&s;ideration, whether that &s;hould go to the re&s;pective benefices upon which it has accumulated, or in aid of the general fund to the u&s;es of the church at large.</P>
<P>I love the church too well to pre&s;s any que&s;tion further than it's intere&s;ts may war|rant; but, informed as I am upon this &s;ub|ject, I am bold to &s;ay, and pledge my&s;elf for what I &s;ay, that the church of England&punc; is not at pre&s;ent &s;o de&s;titute of re&s;ource, as to
<PB N="83" REF="93">
make it nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;ort to your lord&s;hip's &s;cheme of reduction for the &s;upport of it's poorer mini&s;ters; and therefore, if your lord&s;hip's &s;cheme is not recommendable upon it's own merits, as matter of reform, it ought not to be adopted upon motives of nece&s;&s;ity. In plainer words, my lord, the funds of the church applicable to the aug|mentation of poor livings, I do contend are &s;ufficient to augment tho&s;e livings, without reduction of it's dignities, in a much le&s;s compa&s;s of time than the calculations you refer to, and greatly &s;ooner than men in general are aware of. If therefore the&s;e dignities, which you would reduce, were con&s;idered &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the pro&s;perity of the church by doctor Bentley, who&s;e authority you quote for it's poverty; how much more rea&s;on is there now again&s;t reducing tho&s;e dignities, when the poverty of the church at large, cannot be urged as a plea for the re|duction you propo&s;e?</P>
<P>It has been the policy of the body corpo|rate, in whom the revenues of the fir&s;t-fruits and tenths are ve&s;ted, to make a my&s;|tery of their proceedings. It would be more for the honour of the church that this board
<PB N="84" REF="94">
&s;hould not withhold from the friends of the church, &s;uch rea&s;onable information as &s;hould be required from them: and if there is any immediate probability of the&s;e bills pro|jected by your lord&s;hip taking place, it will behove them, in their own defence, to be more explicit. They are tru&s;tees for the di&s;tribution of a bounty granted by the crown to the church, and they act under powers ve&s;ted in them by act of parliament: I am at a lo&s;s to find any good rea&s;on why a corporation &s;o con&s;tituted, and to &s;uch pur|po&s;es, &s;hould refu&s;e to communicate &s;uch in|telligence touching the application of their tru&s;t, as is for the intere&s;ts of the church to be known.</P>
<P>By the act of the 5th of Queen Anne, pa&s;&s;ed &s;ub&s;equent to the bounty-act, the bi&s;hops were directed to certify into the ex|chequer the clear yearly value of &s;mall bene|fices with cure of &s;ouls, within their re|&s;pective dioce&s;es, in order that &s;uch benefices as did not exeeed &pound;. 50 <HI>per annum,</HI> &s;hould be di&s;charged from payment of fir&s;t-fruits and tenths for ever. It would be &s;atisfactory to compare the&s;e returns with the pre&s;ent re|turns of &s;mall benefices not exceeding &pound;. 50;
<PB N="85" REF="95">
it would be &s;atisfactory to know the amount of monies ve&s;ted in the funds, accumulated from the unapplied &s;urplu&s;age of the fir&s;t-fruits, &amp;c.; for the&s;e data would enable us to correct the errors of calculators, which mi&s;lead the public judgement and give an air of nece&s;&s;ity to propo&s;als for levelling and reducing dignities, which nece&s;&s;ity I am &s;atisfied does not exi&s;t, and which propo&s;als I am &s;ure are in their nature ruinous and fatal to the hierarchy.</P>
<P>Dr. Burn computes the clear amount of the bounty to make 55 augmentations yearly. He does not tell us what he calls the <HI>clear amount;</HI> but I rate it at 20,000 <HI>l.</HI> per annum. It was about thirty years ago, upon a certain occa&s;ion, it appeared, that the corporation of Queen Anne's bounty had 300,000 <HI>l.</HI> in the funds: how that may have &s;ince en|crea&s;ed, I know not; but if we add the &s;ur|plu&s;age of intere&s;t above two per cent. upon this capital, and take into account be&s;ides, the contribution of one moiety from the private patrons of all &s;mall livings augmented by the church, this computation of 55 augmen|tations yearly will be &s;hort of the truth. With re&s;pect to the annual income of the
<PB N="86" REF="96">
bounty, I believe I am correct; as to the amount of the &s;urplu&s;age, if I am mi&s;taken, it is to be hoped, they at lea&s;t who withhold the information, will excu&s;e the error.</P>
<P>Though it is probable your lord&s;hip's publication will not exactly produce the ends propo&s;ed, yet it is likely to be followed by con&s;equences that will bring to light the&s;e <HI>arcana</HI> of the church. An innovating &s;pirit is &s;o prevalent in this age, and the word <HI>re|form</HI> is a word &s;o popular, that the church will be driven to it's defence. The current of the times, my lord, is in your favour, and the weak efforts of an individual to &s;tem the fa&s;hionable propen&s;ity, is at be&s;t but an un|thankful office. Other &s;chemes, I have rea|&s;on to believe, are in projection; the &s;ignal for conflict is thrown out, and the &s;truggle mu&s;t finally be decided by &s;tronger hands.</P>
<P>If I am well informed, there is an egg in the ne&s;t, and one is brooding it, who will hatch a cockatrice: the time may be at hand when your lord&s;hip, with the re&s;t of your brethren, may fly to your nur&s;ing-father the King, the &s;upreme head of the church, and &s;eek protection under that fo&s;tering influ|ence which you now arraign:

Upon the &s;ubject of <HI>mortmain,</HI> which your lord&s;hip has &s;lightly touched, I have only to ob&s;erve, that if the difficulties of purcha&s;ing lands for the augmentation of &s;mall bene|fices have already been &s;uch as to occa&s;ion an accumulation &s;o great as I &s;uppo&s;e it is, it may be for the wi&s;dom of the church to provide &s;ome means of prevention in future, &s;o that the revenue of the fir&s;t-fruits and tenths may have its full operation; and this perhaps cannot be better done than by al|lowing the clergy to accept of certain pay|ments from the funds, in lieu of rents from lands held in mortmain, according to your lord&s;hip's idea; and this I think will call for &s;peedy con&s;ideration, both from church and &s;tate.</P>
<P>And now, my lord, in conclu&s;ion, I a&s;&s;ure you, that my motive for addre&s;&s;ing this publication to you, has ari&s;en &s;olely from &s;incerity of opinion, and a &s;trong per&s;ua&s;ion of the evil con&s;equences of di&s;turbing the dignities and revenues of the church as now e&s;tabli&s;hed. A love of controver&s;y, or a vain conceit of trying &s;trength with your lord|&s;hip in this or any other que&s;tion, never en|tered my mind. What may follow from it

time will &s;hew; at all events, I hope it will not give di&s;plea&s;ure to your lord&s;hip: if upon revi&s;al I had found the pa&s;&s;age that could ju&s;tly give it, I had &s;truck it out.

<P>Taking the numbers as above, without de|ducting the &s;mall livings augmented &s;ince his calculation, it appears that 55 augmenta|tions of 400 <HI>l.</HI> each, make 22,000 <HI>l.</HI> yearly.</P>
<P>If we e&s;timate the income of the bounty at 20,000 <HI>l.</HI> this leaves only the &s;um of 2,000 <HI>l.</HI> annually for benefactions of pri|vate patrons, bounties and beque&s;ts, &amp;c.
