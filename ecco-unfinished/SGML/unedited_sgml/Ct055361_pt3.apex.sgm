<HEAD>BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS county is &s;ituated in the very heart of the kingdom, and is bounded on the ea&s;t by the counties of Bedford and Hunting|don; on the &s;outh by tho&s;e of Buckingham and Oxford; on the we&s;t by Warwick&s;hire; and on the north by the counties of Leice&s;ter, Rutland, and Lincoln, which are &s;eparated from it by the le&s;&s;er Avon, and the Welland. Its greate&s;t length is about fifty miles, its greate&s;t breadth about twenty, and its circumference about one hundred and thirty. It contains thirty-three pari&s;hes, in which are one city, eleven market towns, and one hundred and fifty thou&s;and inhabitants. Nine mem|bers are returned to parliament for this county, viz. two knights for the &s;hire, two for the city of
<PB N="4" REF="30">
Peterborough, two for each of the towns of North|ampton and Brockley, and one for Higham Fer|rers. It lies in the Midland-circuit, and the dio|ce&s;e of Peterborough.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>As this county is dry, well cultivated, free from mar&s;hes, except the fens about Peterborough, in the centre of the kingdom, and of cour&s;e at a di&s;tance from the &s;ea, it enjoys a very pure and whole&s;ome air. In con&s;equence of this, it is very populous, and &s;o full of towns and churches, that thirty &s;pires, or &s;leeples, may be &s;een in many places at one view: and even in the fens, the inhabitants &s;eem to enjoy a good &s;tate of health, and to be little affected by the water, which fre|quently overflows their grounds, e&s;pecially in winter, but is never &s;uffered to remain long upon it. Its &s;oil ix exceeding fertile, both in corn and pa&s;turage; but it labours under a &s;carcity of fuel, as it doth not produce much wood, and by lying at a di&s;tance from the &s;ea, cannot be ea&s;ily &s;up|plied with coal. Its commodities, be&s;ides corn, are &s;heep, wool, black-cattle, and &s;alt-petre; and its manufactures, &s;erges, tammies, &s;halloons, boots, and &s;hoes.</P>

<HEAD>RIVERS.</HEAD>
<P>Be&s;ides many le&s;&s;er brooks and &s;treams, it is well watered by the rivers Nen, Welland, Ou&s;e, and Leam, the three fir&s;t of which are large, and for the mo&s;t part navigable.</P>

<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Peterborough city was antiently called Mede&s;|well-ham&s;ted, from a &s;pring in the middle of the
<PB N="5" REF="40">
river Nen, oppo&s;ite the town, but afterwards Pe|terborough, from a mona&s;tery built and dedicated to St. Peter, by Wolpher, king of the Mercians. This mona&s;tery being de&s;troyed by the Danes, was rebuilt about the year 960, by Ethelwold, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter. At the di&s;&s;olution of the abbeys, Henry VIII. erected a bi&s;hopric here, a&s;&s;igning this county and Rutland&s;hire for its dioce&s;e. The cathedral, which is very antient, is a mo&s;t &s;tately Gothic fabric. The we&s;t front in particular, with its arches and columns, is much admired, as is al&s;o the painting of the windows; and the mo&s;t remarkable monuments are tho&s;e of Catharine of Spain, queen to Henry VIII. and of Mary, queen of Scots. It is a hand&s;ome well built town. The river Nen running hard by, and being navi|gable, they export by it a great deal of malt and woollen manufactures, and import coal and corn, &amp;c. By a charter from Henry VIII. the corporation con&s;i&s;ts of a mayor, recorder, and aldermen; but the city officers are elected by the dean and chapter, who are lords of the manor. They have plenty of good water; but their air, on account of the fens in the neighbourhood, is not e&s;teemed very whole|&s;ome. Be&s;ides the bi&s;hop, dean, and chapter, con|&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix prebendaries, there are eight petty canons, four &s;tudents in divinity, one epi&s;tler, one go&s;peller, a &s;ub-dean, &s;ub trea&s;urer, a chanter, eight choiri&s;ters, eight &s;inging men, two chancel|lors, a ma&s;ter, u&s;her, and twenty &s;cholars at a grammar-&s;chool, be&s;ides a &s;teward, organi&s;t, and other inferior officers. This city gives the title of earl to the family of the Mordaunts.</P>
<P>Northampton was formerly, as Cambden affirms, called North-afandon, from its &s;ituation to the north of the river Nen, called antiently Aufona, by which, and another le&s;&s;er river, it is almo&s;t in|clo&s;ed. Dr. Gib&s;on &s;ays, that the antient Saxon
<PB N="6" REF="50">
annals called both it and Southampton, &s;imply Hamtun, and afterwards, to di&s;tingui&s;h them, called the one, from its &s;ituation, Southamtun, and the other Northamtun, but never North|afandon. Tho' it does not appear to be a place of great antiquity, yet here was a ca&s;tle, and a church dedicated to St. Andrew, built by Simon de Sancto Licio, commonly called Senlez, the fir&s;t earl of Northampton of that name. It is &s;aid to have been burnt down during the Dani&s;h depre|dations; but in the reign of St. Edward it appears to have been a con&s;iderable place. It was be&s;ieged by the barons in their war with king John, at which time that military work, called Hun&s;hill, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been rai&s;ed. In the time of Henry III. it &s;ided with the barons, when it was be&s;ieged and taken by the king. Here the bloody battle was fought in which Henry VI. was taken pri&s;oner; and &s;everal parliaments have been held in this town. It was entirely con&s;umed by a mo&s;t dreadful fire in 1675, yet, by the help of liberal contributions from all parts of the king|dom, it hath &s;o recovered it&s;elf, that it is now one of the neate&s;t and be&s;t built towns of the kingdom. Among the public buildings, which are all lofty, the mo&s;t remarkable are the church called All|hallows, the &s;e&s;&s;ions and a&s;&s;ize hou&s;e, and the George inn, which belongs to the poor of the town. There was formerly a nunnery in the neighbouring meadows. A county ho&s;pital, or infirmary, has been lately built here, after the manner of tho&s;e of Bath, London, Bri&s;tol, &amp;c. It has a con&s;idera|ble manufacture of &s;hoes and &s;tockings, and its fairs are noted for hor&s;es both for draught and &s;addle; be&s;ides, it is a great thoroughfare for the north and we&s;t roads. It is governed by a mayor, two bailiffs, four aldermen, twelve magi&s;trates,
<PB N="7" REF="60">
a recorder, a town-clerk, a common-council, forty eight burge&s;&s;es, and five &s;erjeants. It gives title of earl to the family of Compton.</P>
<P>Higham Ferrers is a &s;mall, but neat, clean town. The fir&s;t part of its name is derived from its &s;itu|ation on a ri&s;ing ground, and the other from the family of Ferrers, who had once a ca&s;tle here. It &s;tands on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Nen, and is an antient borough and corporation, governed by a mayor, &s;teward, recorder, &s;even aldermen, thirteen capi|tal burge&s;&s;es and commonalty. It has a free|&s;chool and alms-hou&s;e, a college for &s;ecular clerks and prebendaries, and an ho&s;pital for the poor, founded by Henry Chicheley, archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury.</P>
<P>Brackley, that is a place full of brakes or fern, is &s;aid to be the third borough in England in point of antiquity. It &s;tands near the head of the Ou&s;e, and was once a noted market for wool; but that advantage it hath lo&s;t. Its corporation con|&s;i&s;ts of a mayor, cho&s;en every year at the court|leet of the lord of the manor, and returned by the &s;teward, &s;ix aldermen, and twenty-&s;ix bur|ge&s;&s;es. It has a free-&s;chool, and two pari&s;h churches.</P>
<P>Oundale, or Oundle, a contraction of Avon|dale, as being almo&s;t &s;urrounded by the Avon, is a neat little town. Here are two &s;tately &s;tone bridges over the river, a free-&s;chool, an alms-hou&s;e founded by Sir William Laxton, lord mayor of London, of which the grocers company in Lon|don are tru&s;tees; and a well, that &s;ometimes makes an odd kind of rumbling noi&s;e, the forerunner, as the common people imagine, of war, or &s;ome other calamity.</P>
<P>Wellingborough, a large market town upon the Nen, antiently called Wedlingborough. It
<PB N="8" REF="70">
was once de&s;troyed by the Danes; and afterwards king John, at the reque&s;t of the monks of Croy|land, to whom the manor belonged, granted it a market. In 1738 it &s;uffered greatly by a fire; but hath been &s;ince rebuilt. Its mineral waters were formerly much frequented; and Mary, king Charles 1&s;t's queen, was here &s;everal weeks drink|ing them. It has a good market for corn, and a very con&s;iderable manufacture of lace.</P>
<P>Thorp&s;ton, commonly pronounced Thrap&s;ton, is &s;ituated in a plea&s;ant valley upon the Avon, which has been made navigable to the town. It is a charming place for &s;uch as delight in &s;olitude and rural &s;cenes.</P>
<P>Daventry, or Daintry. This town's chief de|pendance is upon travellers to and from the north|we&s;t counties, for who&s;e accommodation it hath many inns. Upon a high hill are the remains of a Roman camp, four &s;quare, taking up two hun|dred acres, or thereabouts, in which a great many Roman coins have been found. The Roman high|way, called Watling-&s;treet, pa&s;&s;ed thro' this town, and is yet plainly di&s;tingui&s;hable in &s;everal places. Here was formerly a mona&s;tery of Augu&s;tine friars. The government of the town is ve&s;ted in a mayor, aldermen, &s;teward, and twelve freemen.</P>
<P>Towce&s;ter is a large town upon the highway to Che&s;ter, con&s;i&s;ting of one long &s;treet. From the three bridges over as many branches of a little river, the Roman military way that pa&s;&s;es by it, and the coins &s;ometimes found about it, this town is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the <HI>Tripontium</HI> of Antoni|nus. The inhabitants are all employed in the manufacture of &s;ilk and lace.</P>
<P>Rockingham gives title of earl and marquis to the family of Wat&s;on-Wentworth, and &s;tands on the Willand. Here was formerly a ca&s;tle upon a hill,
<PB N="9" REF="80">
&s;urrounded by a fore&s;t, extending fourteen miles in length, and four in breadth, in the year 1640, and before it was much larger; but now it is inter&s;per&s;ed with towns, fields, and lawns.</P>
<P>Kettering is a hand&s;ome town, and plea&s;antly &s;ituated. It has a manufacture of &s;halloons, &s;erges, and tammies, in which a great many hands are employed.</P>
<P>Rothwell, or Rouwell, is a pretty good town, has a noted hor&s;e-fair, and a market-hou&s;e, em|belli&s;hed with the arms of mo&s;t of the gentlemen of the county.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES.</HEAD>
<P>Be&s;ides the antiquities we have mentioned al|ready, we mu&s;t not omit the following: at Chip|ping-wardon, on the &s;outh-we&s;t &s;ide of the coun|ty, they often dig up the foundations of antient buildings and Roman coins; and at Charleton, not far from thence, there is a camp, with a dou|ble fortification, called Ram&s;borough. Green's Norton, near Lacy fore&s;t, was antiently held in capite of the king, for the &s;ervice of lifting up the right hand towards the king yearly on Chri&s;tmas|day, in what place &s;oever he then happened to be. Several antient fortifications have been ob&s;erved upon the river Nen, as at Mill-Cotton, Che&s;ter, and Clifford-hill, which appear to have been the work of the Romans by the coins, urns, &amp;c. found there. At Gild&s;borough, near Daintrey, the re|mains of Roman military works are likewi&s;e to be &s;een; and between Cate&s;by and Badby, there is a large encampment, the area of which is about ten acres. More ea&s;tward, upon the Nen, &s;tands Wedon on the Street, once the royal &s;eat of Wol|pher, king of the Mercians, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be the <HI>Bennavenna</HI> of Antoninus. Within the de|me&s;nes
<PB N="10" REF="90">
of Boughton is a &s;pring, which incru&s;teth wood, or any thing that falls into it, with a &s;tony &s;ub&s;tance. At Ca&s;ter, and on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river, the <HI>Durobrevae</HI> of the Romans, and the <HI>Dormanche&s;ter</HI> of the Saxons, &s;eems to have &s;tood; chequered pavements, and great quantities of Roman coins have been found here, and from hence went two high-ways, the remains of which are &s;till vi&s;ible, the one called Forty-foot-way, from its being forty foot broad, to Stamford; the other called Long-ditch and High-&s;treet, by Lol|ham bridges, thro' We&s;t-Deeping into Lincoln|&s;hire. Cordyke, a contraction of Caer-dyke, near Peterborough, is a huge fo&s;&s;e or ditch, which &s;eems to have been made by the Romans for draining the fens. Na&s;eby, eleven miles from Northampton, is noted for the bloody battle fought June 14, 1645, between Charles I. and the parliament. At Culworth, not far from Towce&s;ter, the &s;tones call|ed a&s;troites are found; and at A&s;trop are mineral waters, &s;aid to be good in &s;corbutic and other ca&s;es. At Oxenden, near Kettering, is a re|markable echo. At Che&s;ter, near Higham-Fer|rers, are the remains of a Roman camp, fortified with a &s;tone wall, within which many coins, pave|ments, &amp;c. have been found. Near Northamp|ton is Holmeby-hou&s;e, where Charles I. was im|pri&s;oned. Fotheringay-ca&s;tle, where Richard III. was born, and Mary queen of Scots beheaded, is upon a branch of the Nen, near Oundle. In the church are the monuments of Edward and Richard, dukes of York; and its windows are finely painted.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>It has Bedford&s;hire on the &s;outh, Northampton|&s;hire on the we&s;t and north, where they are part|ed by the river Avon, and Cambridge&s;hire on the ea&s;t. It is but of &s;mall extent, not exceeding twenty-five miles in length, twenty in breadth, and &s;eventy in circumference. It is divided into four hundreds, and &s;eventy-nine pari&s;hes, containing about two hundred and forty thou&s;and acres, &s;ix market-towns, and about fifty thou&s;and inhabi|tants. As this county, Cambridge&s;hire, and the i&s;le of Ely, have but one &s;heriff, he is cho&s;en out of them by turns. It is a part of the dioce&s;e of Lincoln, and in the Norfolk circuit. It &s;ends four members to parliament, two for the county, and two for Huntingdon, the archdeacon of which is ve&s;ted with the eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction of the county.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>In the low mar&s;hy grounds the air cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to be very whole&s;ome, e&s;pecially to &s;trangers; but the &s;oil is rich, producing plenty of corn and gra&s;s. In the higher grounds, the air is very good; and tho' the &s;oil is not &s;o fertile as in the lower, yet it is very proper for &s;heep, and accordingly great flocks are grazed there. Herds of cows and black cattle are kept in the fens, which yield al&s;o plenty of fi&s;h, water-fowl, and turf for fuel. In the fenny ground grow great quantities
<PB N="13" REF="120">
of willows, whence the county is &s;ometimes nick|named Willow&s;hire.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>RIVERS.</HEAD>
<P>The chief rivers are the Ou&s;e and Nen. There are &s;everal meers or lakes in the county, which yield abundance of fi&s;h, but are &s;aid to be &s;ome|times greatly agitated, even in calm weather, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be owing to &s;ubterraneous winds. Medicinal &s;prings too are found in &s;ome parts of it.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Huntingdon is the chief town of the county, and gives name to it. It was by the Saxons called Hunter's Down, becau&s;e in tho&s;e times the greate&s;t part of the county was a fore&s;t; but it was di&s;|fore&s;ted by Henry II. and III. and Edward I. It is a well built town, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of one long &s;treet, on the north &s;ide of the Ou&s;e, which is na|vigable as high as Bedford by barges, and has a bridge over it. This town was formerly more con&s;iderable, for it had once fifteen churches, which are now reduced to two, an abbey founded by the empre&s;s Maud, and a ca&s;tle, which was demoli&s;hed by Henry II. It had its fir&s;t charter from king John; tho' it is not governed according to that charter at pre&s;ent, but by a mayor, twelve aldermen, and burge&s;&s;es. Here the a&s;&s;izes are always held; and here al&s;o is the county gaol, and a good grammar &s;chool. The meadows that &s;ur|round the town are very beautiful, and are ren|dered more &s;o by the numerous flocks and herds that are fed in them. This town formerly gave title of earl to &s;everal princes of Scotland, and was the birth-place of the famous Oliver Crom|well. At pre&s;ent it gives title of earl to the fa|mily
<PB N="14" REF="130">
of Ha&s;tings, and has ever &s;ince the reign of Henry VIII.</P>
<P>Godmanche&s;ter, antiently called Gormanche&s;ter, from Gorman the Dane, who obtained the&s;e parts from king Alfred, by an article of the peace con|cluded between them. The place con&s;i&s;ts almo&s;t entirely of wealthy hu&s;bandmen, who being obliged, by their tenure, to attend the king with their ploughs, when he vi&s;its the&s;e parts, upon &s;uch occa&s;ions always make a very fine appearance. When James I. pa&s;&s;ed this way to London, they met him with &s;eventy ploughs and teams, with which he was &s;o well plea&s;ed, that he incorpo|rated them by the name of two bailiffs, twelve a&s;&s;i&s;tants, and the commonalty of the borough of Godmanche&s;ter. They boa&s;t that they have for|merly entertained the kings of England in their progre&s;s, with a ru&s;tic &s;hew of nine &s;core of ploughs. It &s;eems to be the &s;ame place which Antoninus calls <HI>Duroliponte,</HI> as <HI>Duro&s;iponte,</HI> which differs from the other only by one letter, &s;ignifies in the Briti&s;h, a bridge over the Ou&s;e, and it &s;tands on the other &s;ide the Ou&s;e, over again&s;t Huntingdon. Upon the London road, between Huntingdon and Caxton, and not far from Godmanche&s;ter, is the famous tree called the Beggar's-bu&s;h. From the name of this tree, it is commonly &s;aid of a &s;pend|thrift in the county, that he is in the way to Beg|gar's-bu&s;h.</P>
<P>St. Neots, or St. Needs, was &s;o called from one Neotus, a learned and pious per&s;on, who &s;pent his life in propagating the Chri&s;tian religion, and had a mona&s;tery here dedicated to him, and richly en|dowed, which was burnt by the Danes. It is a large town, has a hand&s;ome church and &s;teeple, and &s;ome trade by means of the Ou&s;e, on which it &s;tands, and over which it has a bridge. It gives title of baron to the earl of Sandwich. At Hael|we&s;ton,
<PB N="15" REF="140">
a &s;mall village not far off, are two &s;prings, of which one, that is bracki&s;h, is &s;aid to give re|lief in cutaneous di&s;orders, and the other to the dim-&s;ighted.</P>
<P>St. Ives &s;tands upon the Ou&s;e, in the middle of plea&s;ant meadows, and is large and well built, with a fine &s;tone bridge over the river. It derives its name from Ivo, a Per&s;ian, who after travelling over England, and preaching the go&s;pel with great zeal, about the year 600, is &s;aid to have died here. It &s;eems to have had a mint in former times, and was once famed for its medicinal waters. Not many years ago it &s;uffered greatly by a fire; but hath been &s;ince rebuilt.</P>
<P>Kimbolton is a neat town, &s;eated in a bottom, in the we&s;t part of the county, and was called by the Romans Kinnebantum. A noble &s;eat is erected upon the foundations of the ancient ca&s;tle by the Montagues, fir&s;t earls, and now dukes of Man|che&s;ter, to whom the town gives the title of baron.</P>
<P>Ram&s;ey is noted for its market for fat cattle and water-fowl. Its name &s;ignifies the Rams-i&s;le, as it is &s;eparated on all &s;ides from terra firma by lakes and fens, except where it is joined to it by a long cau&s;ey. Formerly it had a famous mona&s;tery dedicated to St. Dun&s;tan, who&s;e abbot was mitred, and &s;at in parliament. This abbey was founded by Alwyn, cou&s;in to king Edgar, and was one of the riche&s;t in England, on which account the place was called Ram&s;ey the rich. The gardens, corn-fields, and rich pa&s;tures, with which it is &s;urrounded, make it very plea&s;ant in &s;ummer. An antient cau&s;ey pa&s;&s;es from hence to Peterborough, called King's-Delf. In 1720 a va&s;t many Roman coins were found; and in 1730 a fire de&s;troyed a great number of hou&s;es. Nothing of the abbey is now left, except a part of the gatehou&s;e, and a muti|lated
<PB N="16" REF="150">
&s;tatue of Alwyn, thought to be one of the olde&s;t now extant made in England.</P>
<P>Yaxley is a little town, pretty well-built, among the fens. There is another of the &s;ame name upon Wittle&s;ey-meer.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>CURIOSITIES and ANTIQUITIES.</HEAD>
<P>Wittle&s;ey-meer is a lake &s;ix miles long, and three broad, the water of which is clear, and well &s;tored with fi&s;h, but often agitated when no wind is &s;tirring. The air about it is intolerable to &s;trangers, but agrees with the native well enough. One of the&s;e &s;hakes, to which the water is &s;ubject, had like to have been fatal to king Canute, as he was pa&s;&s;ing it with his family.</P>
<P>Henry of Huntingdon &s;ays, there was once a city called Caer-Dorm, and Dormecea&s;ter, upon the Nen, nigh Walmsford; but that it was all in ruins before his time. It is now called Darnford. From the re&s;emblance of the names, from the old coins found about it, and other marks of antiquity, it appears to be the Durobriva of Antoninus. From hence there runs a Roman way directly to Huntingdon, which the Saxons called Ermin|&s;treet. Above Stilton it appears with a bank, and runs thro' the middle of a &s;quare fort, defended on the north-&s;ide with walls, on the re&s;t with ramparts of earth, near which &s;tone coffins have been dug up.</P>

<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The air is very different in different parts of the county. In the fens it is moi&s;t and foggy, and therefore not &s;o whole&s;ome; but in the &s;outh and ea&s;t parts it is very good, the&s;e being much drier than the other: but both, by late improvements, have been rendered very fruitful, the former by draining, and the latter by cinque-foil; &s;o that it produces plenty of corn, e&s;pecially barley, &s;affron, and hemp, affords the riche&s;t pa&s;tures, and in con&s;equence of that, cattle and butter. The rivers abound with fi&s;h, and the fens with wild fowl. The principal manufactures of the county are malt, paper, and ba&s;kets.</P>

<HEAD>RIVERS and FENS.</HEAD>
<P>The chief rivers are the Ou&s;e, which divides the county into two parts, and is navigable from Cambridge to Lynn in Norfolk; the Cam, which in the Briti&s;h &s;ignifies crooked, to denote its winding; the Welland, the Glene, the Witham, and that called Peterborough river, which is na|vigable to that city from Wi&s;bech.</P>
<P>The fens called Bedford Level con&s;i&s;t of about three hundred thou&s;and acres of mar&s;hy ground, lying in Cambridge&s;hire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Hun|tingdon&s;hire, Northampton&s;hire, and Lincoln&s;hire, and &s;urrounded on all hands, except towards the &s;ea, with high lands. As it appears to have been dry land formerly, the great change it has under|gone mu&s;t have been owing either to a violent breach and inundation of the &s;ea, or to earth|quakes. As the towns in and about the fens were great &s;ufferers by the &s;tagnation of the waters in &s;ummer, and want of provi&s;ions in winter, many attempts were made to drain them, but without &s;ucce&s;s, until the time of Charles I. in which, and that of his &s;on, the work was happily compleated, and an act of parliament pa&s;&s;ed, by which a cor|poration was e&s;tabli&s;hed for its pre&s;ervation and government. By the &s;ame act, eighty-three thou|&s;and acres were ve&s;ted in the corporation, and ten thou&s;and in the king. In the&s;e fens are a great many decoys, in which incredible numbers of ducks, and other wild fowl, are caught during the &s;ea&s;on. Whoever de&s;ires a more particular ac|count of them, may con&s;ult Sir Jonas Moor's map and hi&s;tory, Sir William Dugdale's account, and that printed for Mo&s;es Pitt in 1685.</P>

<P>Cambridge derives its name from the bridge over the Cam, which divides the town into two parts. Either it, or a place in the neighbourhood, was &s;tiled Camboritum, in the time of the Romans. It &s;uffered much during the wars with the Danes. Here was a ca&s;tle built by William the Conqueror, of which the gatehou&s;e yet remains, and is now the county gaol. By Doom&s;day-book it appears, that it then had ten wards, containing three hun|dred and eighty-&s;even hou&s;es. In William Rufus's reign it was quite de&s;troyed by Roger de Mont|gomery; but Henry I. be&s;towed many privileges upon it, particularly an exemption from the power of the &s;heriff, on condition of its paying yearly in|to the Exchequer one hundred marks (equivalent to one thou&s;and pounds now) and from tolls, la&s;t|age, pontage, pa&s;&s;age, and &s;tallage, in all fairs of his dominions. There is a ditch, &s;till called the King's-ditch, made by Henry III. during the ba|rons wars, to &s;ecure it again&s;t the rebels in the i&s;le of Ely. In the rebellion of Wat Tyler and Jack Straw, in the reign of Richard II. the Univer&s;ity|records were burnt. The place now called the Jewry was formerly inhabited by Jews. The glory of Cambridge is its univer&s;ity, but when it had its beginning is uncertain. At fir&s;t there was no public provi&s;ion for the accommodation or maintenance of the &s;cholars; but afterwards inns began to be erected by pious per&s;ons for their

of the archives, three e&s;quire-beadles, one yeoman-beadle, and a library-keeper. Each col|lege has its &s;chools and library, as at Oxford, of which tho&s;e of Trinity and St. John are the mo&s;t con&s;iderable. King George I. purcha&s;ed, for one thou&s;and pounds, the library of Dr. Moor, bi&s;hop of Ely, con&s;i&s;ting of thirty thou&s;and volumes, and made a pre&s;ent of it to the univer&s;ity, which, out of gratitude, erected in 1739, a fine marble &s;tatue of that prince in the &s;enate-hall of King's|college. A profe&s;&s;or of modern languages and hi&s;tory was al&s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed here and at Oxford, with a &s;alary of four hundred pounds for him&s;elf and two to teach under him, by king George I. in 1724. In 1728 a profe&s;&s;or&s;hip for natural philo|&s;ophy was erected by Dr. Woodward, a profe&s;&s;or at Gre&s;ham college, London, with a &s;alary of one hundred and fifty pounds a-year. The &s;ame gen|tleman left them al&s;o his collection of fo&s;&s;ils, and a part of his library. The ma&s;ter and fellows of Catharine-hall are tru&s;tees of an ho&s;pital for the cure of poor di&s;ea&s;ed people gratis, for the build|ing and furni&s;hing of which Dr. Addenbroke left four thou&s;and pounds. Each college has its cha|pel for wor&s;hip; but public &s;ermons are preached at St. Mary's church. The following are the mo&s;t remarkable &s;tructures: 1&s;t, the chapel of King's|college, which for its contrivance and extent, fine carved work in wood and &s;tone, and painted win|dows, is hardly to be equalled in the world. It is entirely of free-&s;tone, roof and all, without one pillar to &s;upport it. 2d, Trinity-college and li|brary, wonderful both for the de&s;ign and execu|tion. We mu&s;t not omit to ob&s;erve, that a fellow&s;hip was founded at Magdalen-college, called the travelling Norfolk fellow&s;hip, becau&s;e it is appropriated to gentlemen of that county. Any per&s;on, that is qualified, may borrow what|ever

book he has occa&s;ion for, from the libraries at Cambridge; and any one that is qualified may &s;tudy in tho&s;e of Oxford. The privilege of &s;end|ing members to parliament was fir&s;t granted to the univer&s;ity by James I. The town is governed by a mayor, high-&s;teward, recorder, thirteen alder|men, of whom the mayor is one, twenty-four common council men, a town-clerk, and other inferior officers. The mayor, when he enters on his office, takes an oath to maintain the privileges of the univer&s;ity. The town has fourteen pari&s;h churches, and is pretty large; but the &s;ituation is low and dirty.</P>
<P>Ely is an antient city, and took its ri&s;e from a famous nunnery and mona&s;tery &s;eated there in former times. Henry I. made it an epi&s;copal &s;ee; and the civil government, both of the city and i&s;le, belongs to the bi&s;hop, who appointeth a judge to hear and determine all cau&s;es ari&s;ing within the &s;ame. Tho' a city, it &s;ends no members to par|liament. It is pretty large, but not populous, by rea&s;on of its fenny &s;ituation and unwhole&s;ome air. The cathedral and bi&s;hop's palace are &s;tate|ly &s;tructures, and it has a free-&s;chool for twenty|four boys. The name of the town is derived either from the cels, which are very plentiful here, or the willows, which are no le&s;s &s;o, and which in Saxon are called Helyz. The ground about it being very rich, and laid out chiefly in gardens, &s;upplies the neighbouring country for a great way with its produce. From this i&s;le the prince of Wales takes the title of marquis.</P>
<P>Wi&s;bich is a well built town in the northern ex|tremity of the i&s;le of Ely. It had formerly a ca&s;tle built by William the Conqueror, and re|built by cardinal Moreton, bi&s;hop of Ely. In the year 1236, it &s;uffered much by an inundation of the &s;ea; but it is now a place of good trade, &s;end|ing

a great deal of oil, oats, and butter, to Lon|don, and bringing back a variety of commodities, with which it &s;upplies the neighbouring country.</P>
<P>Newmarket is a hand&s;ome town, and &s;tands in a good air. Part of it is in this county, and part in Suffolk. Though it is a great thoroughfare, its chief dependence is upon the races, which are the mo&s;t noted and frequented of any in England. The cour&s;e upon the heath is a very fine one, where a prodigious crowd of all ranks a&s;&s;embles in the months of April and October, and where great &s;ums are lo&s;t and won. At the&s;e times the town gets a great deal of money, lodgings and every kind of provi&s;ion being at an extravagant rate. Charles II. u&s;ed always to be pre&s;ent at the&s;e races, and had a hou&s;e built for his re&s;idence during the continuance of them.</P>
<P>Thorney-abbey, &s;o called from a famous abbey that &s;tood formerly here among bu&s;hes and thorns, is &s;ituated among the fens to the north-we&s;t. It was fir&s;t called Ankeridge, from the anchorites dwelling there. The abbey was de&s;troyed by the Danes, but rebuilt by Ethelwold, bi&s;hop of Win|che&s;ter. In William of Malm&s;bury's time, it &s;eems, by his de&s;cription of it, to have been a perfect paradi&s;e; but it hath undergone a great change &s;ince, by being overwhelmed by the &s;ea.</P>

<P>Barnwell, a &s;mall village near Cambridge, &s;o called, as Cambden tells us, from the wells, and the boys, or bairns, and other young people, that u&s;ed to a&s;&s;emble here for &s;port and exerci&s;e on St. John's-eve; whence the fair, that is kept there at Mid&s;ummer, took its ri&s;e. A mo&s;t deplorable accident happened, September 1727, in a barn, in which a great number of people, &s;ome of them of fa&s;hion, were a&s;&s;embled to &s;ee a puppet-&s;hew, having been &s;et on fire.

Sturbridge-fair, kept by a &s;mall brook called the Sture, nigh Cambridge, was once reckoned the greate&s;t in Europe, and is &s;till very con&s;iderable. Prodigious quantities of wool, and woollen manu|factures, are bought and &s;old here. It is kept in a large corn-field near the Cam, by which goods of all &s;orts, to an immen&s;e value, are tran&s;ported to it, and from it, to all parts of England, and even Scotland, be&s;ides what goes by land. The dealers in hops, which is a great article at this fair, occupy a particular part of the field, as the clothiers and dealers in wool do others. There is a &s;treet of booths called Cheap&s;ide, in which are &s;hops with wares of all &s;orts, coffee-hou&s;es, taverns, eat|ing hou&s;es, &amp;c. Large commi&s;&s;ions for goods are negotiated, over and above what is &s;old in the fair. The magi&s;trates of Cambridge keep a court of ju&s;tice in the fair, and proceed in a &s;ummary way, which prevents all that di&s;order and confu|&s;ion that would otherwi&s;e take place. Hackney coaches, from London, ply by land, and wherries upon the Cam, during the fair. After the hurry of bu&s;ine&s;s is over, the neighbouring gentry all round vi&s;it it, and lay out a great deal of money in toys and diver&s;ions.</P>

<P>Suffolk, a contract of Southfolk, &s;o called from its &s;ituation in re&s;pect of Norfolk. It is bounded on the we&s;t by Cambridge&s;hire, on the &s;outh by E&s;&s;ex, from which it is parted by the river Stour;
<PB N="31" REF="310">
on the ea&s;t by the German ocean; and on the north by Norfolk, &s;eparated from it by the le&s;&s;er Ou&s;e and the Waverley. It is upwards of forty miles in length, about twenty-five, at a medium, in breadth, and one hundred and fifty-&s;ix in cir|cumference. It contains twenty-two hundreds, thirty-two market-towns, two hundred and &s;even|ty-five pari&s;hes, thirty-four thou&s;and four hun|dred and twenty-two hou&s;es, and two hundred and &s;ix thou&s;and inhabitants. The whole is di|vided into two parts, viz. the liberty of St. Ed|mund, and the Geldable; the former of which contain the we&s;t parts of the county, and the other the ea&s;t; and there is a grand jury for each at the a&s;&s;izes.</P>

<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The air is reckoned as whole&s;ome and plea&s;ant as any in the kingdom; nor is it otherwi&s;e upon the &s;ea-coa&s;t, which is dry and &s;andy, and free from &s;alt mar&s;hes. The &s;oil, except to the we&s;t and upon the &s;ea-coa&s;t, is very rich, being a com|pound of clay and marle. Towards the &s;ea there are large heaths and tracts of &s;and; but the&s;e pro|duce hemp, rye, and pea&s;e, and feed great flocks of &s;heep. About Newmarket, the &s;oil is much the &s;ame; but in high Suffolk, or the woodlands, be&s;ides wood, there are very rich pa&s;tures, where abundance of cattle are fed. In other parts of the county, as about Bury, there is plenty of corn. As this county is noted for the richne&s;s of its pa&s;tures, &s;o is it for butter and chee&s;e, e&s;pecially the former, which is &s;aid to be extraordinary fine; &s;o that be|ing packed up in firkins, it is &s;old for all u&s;es, both by &s;ea and land, and conveyed to many parts of England, e&s;pecially to London. The inland parts of the county are well &s;upplied with wood
<PB N="32" REF="320">
for fuel, and tho&s;e upon the &s;ea-coa&s;t with coals from Newca&s;tle. The manufactures of the county are chiefly woollen and linen cloth. It lies in the dioce&s;e of Norwich; has two archdeacons, viz. of Sudbury and Suffolk; gives title of earl to a branch of the Howards; &s;ends two members to parlia|ment for the county; and two for each of the fol|lowing places, Ip&s;wich, Dunwich, Orford, Ald|borough, Sudbury, Eye, and St. Edmund's-Bury.</P>

<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Ip&s;wich comes from the Saxon Gype&s;wick, that is, a town &s;ituated upon the Gyppen, now called Orwell. It had once twenty-one churches, but now only twelve. It was plundered by the Danes in 991, and afterwards be&s;ieged by king Stephen. It had charters and a mint in the reign of king John, but its la&s;t charter was from Charles II. The remains of a wall and &s;ix or &s;even religious hou&s;es are &s;till to be &s;een. Though it is not in &s;o flouri&s;hing a &s;tate as formerly, when the har|bour was more commodious, yet it is &s;till a large well built town. Be&s;ides the churches al|ready mentioned, it has &s;everal meeting-hou&s;es, two chapels, a town-hall, council-chamber, a large market-place with a cro&s;s in the middle of it, a &s;hire-hall for the county-&s;e&s;&s;ions, a library, &s;eve|ral ho&s;pitals, a free-&s;chool, a hand&s;ome &s;tone bridge over the river, &s;tately &s;hambles in the mar|ket-place
<PB N="33" REF="330">
built by cardinal Wol&s;ey, who was a native of the town, and a butcher's &s;on, and who al&s;o began to build a college here, on the ruins of a &s;mall college of black canons, which &s;till bears his name, though it was never fini&s;hed. Here are al&s;o &s;everal alms-hou&s;es, three charity-&s;chools, and a convenient key and cu&s;tom-hou&s;e. By vir|tue of Charles II's charter, the town is governed by two bailiffs, a recorder, twelve portmen, of whom the bailiffs are two, a town-clerk, two co|roners, and twenty-four common-council. The bailiffs and twenty-four of the portmen are ju&s;tices of the peace. The town enjoys a great many privileges,. as pa&s;&s;ing fines and recoveries, trying criminal, and even crown and capital cau&s;es, among them&s;elves, &s;ettling the a&s;&s;ize of bread, wine, and beer. No freeman is obliged to &s;erve on juries out of the town, or bear any office for the king, except that of &s;heriff, or to pay tolls or duties in any other part of the kingdom. They have an admiralty juri&s;diction beyond Harwich on the E&s;&s;ex coa&s;t, and on both &s;ides the Suffolk coa&s;t, by which they are intitled to all goods ca&s;t on &s;hore. The bailiffs even hold an admiralty-court beyond Landguard-fort. By a trial in king Ed|ward III's time, it appears that the town had a right to the cu&s;tom-duties for all goods coming into Harwich haven. They claim a right al&s;o to all waifes and &s;trays, &amp;c. The manufactures of the town are chiefly woollen and linen cloth. It has &s;till a con&s;iderable foreign trade. The tide ri&s;es pretty high, and brings great &s;hips within a &s;mall di&s;tance of the town. They export a great deal of corn to London, and &s;ometimes to Holland. Formerly they had a great trade in &s;hip-building; but that having declined, they now &s;end great quantities of timber to the king's yard at Chatham. It has &s;everal great fairs for cattle, chee&s;e, and but|ter;
<PB N="34" REF="340">
and is admirably &s;ituated for the trade to Greenland, becau&s;e the &s;ame wind that carries them out of the river will carry them to Green|land. It is worth remarking, that it is one of the be&s;t places in England for per&s;ons in nar|row circum&s;tances, hou&s;e rent being ea&s;y, provi|&s;ions cheap and plentiful, the pa&s;&s;age by land or water to London, &amp;c. convenient, and the com|pany of the place good. It gives title of vi&s;count, as well as Thetford, to the duke of Grafton.</P>
<P>Dunwich, that is, a town upon a hill, is very antient, and was once a bi&s;hop's &s;ee, and before that, &s;eems to have been a Roman &s;tation, from the coins &s;ometimes found here. In the reign of William I. it had two hundred and thirty-&s;ix burge&s;&s;es, and one hundred poor. Afterwards it had a mint, and in Henry II's reign, William of Newburrow, tells us, it was a famous village, and well &s;tored with riches of all &s;orts; but by the lo&s;s of its bi&s;hop and mona&s;teries, and the in|roads of the &s;ea, it is now reduced to a parcel of &s;orry cottages. It is a town corporate, governed by two bailiffs and inferior officers, and has &s;ent burge&s;&s;es to parliament &s;ince Edward I&s;t's reign. The free burge&s;&s;es gave king John three hundred marks of &s;ilver, ten falcons, and five gerfalcons for his charter, by which they were made a free borough, with power to try cau&s;es within their own precincts, and other privileges. They pur|cha&s;ed al&s;o a grant of wrecks of the &s;ame king with two hundred marks and five hundred eels.</P>
<P>Orford, at the mouth of the Ore, was once a large populous town, but it has &s;uffered much by the &s;ea's retiring. It had formerly a ca&s;tle, and a nunnery, of both which the ruins are &s;till to be &s;een, particularly of the ca&s;tle, who&s;e towers, and tho&s;e of the church, are a &s;ea-mark. At the Ne&s;s there is a light-hou&s;e, very u&s;eful to &s;eamen. It
<PB N="35" REF="350">
is a corporation by a charter from Henry III. con|&s;i&s;ting of a mayor, eighteen portmen, twelve chief burge&s;&s;es, a recorder, town-clerk, and two &s;erjeants at mace; and gives title of earl to a grand|&s;on of Sir Robert Walpole, created earl of Orford by king George II.</P>
<P>Eye &s;urrounded by a brook, and &s;tanding on the road between Ip&s;wich and Norwich, is but a mean place, the inhabitants being employed chiefly in the manufacture of bone-lace and &s;pin|ning. King John made it a corporation, to con|&s;i&s;t of two bailiffs, ten principal burge&s;&s;es, twenty-four common council men, a recorder, and town|clerk; the bailiffs are cho&s;en out of the principal burge&s;&s;es. It has a large church, and gives title of baron to lord Cornwallis.</P>
<P>Aldborough, an antient and pretty large town, con&s;i&s;ting of two &s;treets, near a mile in length. There is a hand&s;ome church to the we&s;t up|on a hill, and is defended by &s;everal pieces of cannon. Great quantities of &s;oles, &s;prats, and lob&s;ters, are caught here, with which, and with coals and corn, the town drives a pretty good trade. It is a corporation, con&s;i&s;ting of twelve &s;uperior and twenty-four inferior members, and the latter elect two bailiffs out of the former.</P>
<P>Sudbury, that is, the South Borrough, &s;up|po&s;ed to be &s;o called in re&s;pect of Norwich. It has three hand&s;ome churches and other buildings; but the &s;treets, not being paved, are very dirty in bad weather. Its manufactures are &s;ays, &s;er|ges, perpetuanas, &amp;c. in which it drives a con&s;i|derable trade. The river Stour, by act of parlia|ment in queen Anne's reign, made navigable to Maningtree, in E&s;&s;ex, has been of great ad|vantage to it. It is governed by a mayor, recor|der, &s;even aldermen, of whom the mayor is one, twenty-four common-council men, and two &s;er|jeants
<PB N="36" REF="360">
at mace. It gives name to one of the two archdeaconries into which the county is divided, and the title of baron to the duke of Grafton. Here Simon Theobald, archdeacon of Canterbury, who was a native of the town, and beheaded in Wat Tyler's rebellion, lies buried in a chapel of his own building at St. Gregory's church; and here it was where Edward III. placed the Flemings, who fir&s;t brought the woollen manufacture into England.</P>
<P>St. Edmund's-Bury, or Bury St. Edmund's, was &s;o called after the body of St. Edmund, king of the Ea&s;t Angles, whom the Danes had put to death in a very cruel manner, was brought hither and buried in a &s;tately church. Soon after, an abbey was founded in honour of him, which is &s;aid to have been one of the large&s;t and riche&s;t in the world. The gate of it is &s;till remaining, and is a very noble piece of antiquity. This place is often mentioned in hi&s;tory. Sueno, the Dane, it is &s;aid, laid it all in a&s;hes. In king Henry II's time, the Jews, for murdering a boy here, in de|ri&s;ion of our Saviour's crucifixion, and other &s;uch offences el&s;ewhere, were bani&s;hed the kingdom. Near this town the army of the &s;ame Henry twice rendezvou&s;ed during his conte&s;t with his &s;on. Here the barons met, and made their league again&s;t king John. Here a parliament was held in the reign of Henry III. and another in that of Edward I. in who&s;e time, and that of Edward II. there was a mint; and it is &s;aid there was one in the reign of king John. At a parliament held here the 25th of Henry VI. Humphrey, duke of Glouce&s;ter, was murdered, which gave occa|&s;ion to the war between the hou&s;es of Lan|ca&s;ter and York. Gardiner, the per&s;ecuting bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, was a native of this town, and &s;o was Sir Nicholas Bacon, father of Sir Ni|cholas,
<PB N="37" REF="370">
the fir&s;t baronet of England, and of the great lord Verulam. Ledgate too, a famous poet about the year 1440, was a monk of this town. In Charles I's reign, the town was &s;o depopulated by a plague, that the gra&s;s grew in the &s;treets, and four hundred families were &s;ick of it at the &s;ame time. It is a hand&s;ome well-built town, and is called the Montpellier of England, not only for its good air, but al&s;o for the pro&s;pect it commands of a fine open country, and is &s;o regularly built, that almo&s;t all the &s;treets cut one another at right angles. It is reckoned three miles in circuit with|in the walls, and contains five wards, five gates, and thirty-four &s;treets, &s;trait, &s;pacious, and well paved. There are abundance of fine buildings in the town, the mo&s;t remarkable of which are the two pari&s;h churches, which are large and &s;tately, have beautiful windows, neat pillars, and noble roofs. In St. James's is the tomb of Mary II. of France, &s;i&s;ter to Henry VIII. At the re|formation, there were five ho&s;pitals, one college, and forty churches and chapels in it, all well en|dowed. Here is a grammar-&s;chool founded by Edward VI. There is little or no manufacture here, but &s;pinning. It has &s;everal great fairs; but the chief of them, and perhaps the mo&s;t noted in England, is that on St. Matthew's day, which la&s;ts a fortnight, during which the neighbouring gentry come to it every afternoon, when they raffle, go to the play, and then to an a&s;&s;embly at &s;ome gentleman's hou&s;e; for a great many gentle|men live in and about the town. From James I. it obtained the privilege of &s;ending members to parliament, and a charter of incorporation, in con&s;equence of which, it is governed by an al|derman, recorder, town-clerk, coroner, twelve capital burge&s;&s;es, and twenty-four common-coun|cil. In Edward III's time, the town&s;men forced
<PB N="38" REF="380">
the abbey, and made the abbot and monks their pri&s;oners, till they had &s;ealed a charter of incor|poration for the town, given it the cu&s;tody of all its gates, and the ward&s;hips of all its pupils and orphans; for which nineteen of the rioters were tried and executed, the re&s;t fled, the town was fined &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds (for which however two thou&s;and marks were accepted) and all the writ|ings which had been extorted from the abbots and monks made void.</P>

<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, PRODUCE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>The air of the country is very whole&s;ome, but the face of it is very different in different parts; for the ea&s;tern part is hilly, and is called Cotte&s;|wold; the we&s;tern woody, and called the Fore&s;t of Dean; and the re&s;t is a fruitful valley, thro' which the Severn rolls his mighty flood. This river is in &s;ome places between two and three miles broad, and its cour&s;e through the country, including its windings, is not le&s;s than &s;eventy miles. The tide of flood, called the Boar, ri&s;es very high, and is very impetuous. It is remarkable, that the greate&s;t tides are one year at the full moon, and the other at the new; one year the night-tides, and the next the day. This river affords a noble convey|ance for goods and merchandi&s;e of all &s;orts, to and from the county; but it is watered by &s;everal others, as the Wye, the Avon, the I&s;is, the Le|den, the Frome, the Strond, and Windru&s;h, be|&s;ides le&s;&s;er &s;treams, all abounding with fi&s;h, the Severn in particular with &s;almon, conger-eels, and lampreys. The &s;oil is in general very fertile, tho' pretty much diver&s;ified, yielding plenty of corn, pa&s;ture, fruit, and wood. In the hilly part of the county, or Cotte&s;wold, the air is &s;harper than in the lowlands, and the &s;oil, though not &s;o fit for grain, produces excellent pa&s;ture for &s;heep; &s;o that of the four hundred thou&s;and that are com|puted to be kept in the county, the greater part are fed here. Of the&s;e &s;heep the wool is ex|ceeding fine, and hence it is that this &s;hire is &s;o eminent for its manufacture of cloth, of which fifty thou&s;and pieces are &s;aid to have been made yearly, before the practice of clande&s;tinely exporting our wool became &s;o common. In the vale, or lower part of the county, thro' which the Severn pa&s;&s;es,
<PB N="51" REF="510">
the air and &s;oil are very different from tho&s;e of the Cotte&s;wold; for the former is much warmer and richer, yielding the mo&s;t luxuriant pa&s;tures; in con&s;equence of which numerous herds of black cattle are kept, and great quantities of that excellent chee&s;e, for which it is &s;o much cele|brated, made in it. The remaining part of the county, called the Fore&s;t of Dean, was formerly almo&s;t entirely over-run with wood, and extended twenty miles in length, and ten in breadth. It was then a ne&s;t of robbers, e&s;pecially towards the Severn; but now it contains many towns and vil|lages, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of miners, employed in the coal-pits, or in digging for, or forging iron ore, with both which the fore&s;t abounds. The&s;e miners have their particular laws, cu&s;toms, courts, and judges; and the king, as in all royal fore&s;ts, has a &s;wain-mote, for the pre&s;ervation of the vert and veni&s;on. This fore&s;t was antiently, and is &s;till noted for its oaks, which thrive here &s;urpri|&s;ingly; but as there is a prodigious con&s;umption of wood in the forges, it is continually dwindling way. <Q>There were &s;o many religious hou&s;es in the county before the reformation, that it gave occa|&s;ion to the proverb, &startq;As &s;ure as God is in Glo|ce&s;ter&s;hire.&endq;</Q></P>

<P>Gloce&s;ter, the capital, is an antient city, and by Antoninus is called Clevum, or Glevum, which Cambden thinks was formed from the Briti&s;h Caer-Glowe, &s;ignifying a fair city. It was built by the Romans to curb the Silures, and a colony was placed there called Colonia Glevum. It &s;tands upon the bank of the Severn, and ex|cept on the &s;ide next the river, is &s;urrounded by a wall. Towards the &s;outh there was antiently a ca&s;tle built in the time of William the Conqueror,
<PB N="52" REF="520">
the remains of which is now the common gaol for debtors and felons. Ceaulin, king of the We&s;t Saxons, fir&s;t took it from the Britons in 570; but it afterwards became &s;ubject to the Mer|cians. The pre&s;ent cathedral was erected by Al|dred, archbi&s;hop of York, and bi&s;hop of Wor|ce&s;ter after the conque&s;t, but hath been greatly improved and adorned &s;ince. In the &s;outh i&s;le Edward II. lies interred in an alaba&s;ter tomb; and not far from him, in the middle of the quire, Ro|bert Curt ho&s;e, elde&s;t &s;on of William the Con|queror. This city &s;uffered much in the barons wars, was plundered by Edward, the &s;on of Henry III. and not long after almo&s;t entirely de&s;troyed by an accidental fire. King John made it a borough; and Henry III. who was crowned here, a corporation. Richard III. made it a county of it&s;elf, adding two hundreds to it, and gave it his &s;word and cap of maintenance. It had once eleven pari&s;h churches, but five of them were demoli&s;hed, when it was be&s;ieged by Charles I. again&s;t whom it had &s;hut its gates. In the reign of Charles II. its walls were pulled down, and two hundreds taken from its county by act of parliament. It was erected into an epi&s;copal &s;ee by Henry VIII. on the &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion of the abbey of St. Peter, with a dean and &s;ix prebends. About the time of the conque&s;t, its chief bu&s;ine&s;s &s;eems to have been forging of iron; for in Doom&s;day-book it is &s;aid, that the only tribute required of it was &s;o many icres, or bars of iron. At pre&s;ent it has ten incorporated companies, a &s;tone-bridge over the river, with a key and wharf; and tho' it is &s;o well &s;ituated for trade, yet its traffic is not con&s;iderable, having been much impaired by the neighbourhood of Bri&s;tol. One of its chief manufactures now is pin|making. Several parliaments were antiently held here, particularly by Richard II. and III. and in
<PB N="53" REF="530">
the town are many cro&s;&s;es and &s;tatues of the kings of England. By a charter from Charles II. it is governed by a &s;teward, mayor, recorder, twelve aldermen, a town clerk, two &s;heriffs cho&s;en yearly out of twenty-&s;ix common-council men, a &s;word|bearer, and four &s;erjeants at mace. Cambden &s;ays, the Roman-way, that extends from St. David's in Wales to Southampton, pa&s;&s;es thro' this city. It gives title of duke to the &s;econd brother of his pre|&s;ent maje&s;ty George III.</P>
<P>Cirence&s;ter takes its name from the river Churn, on which it &s;tands. It is very antient, being by Ptolemy called Corinium, and by Antoninus Du|rocornovium. That it was a con&s;iderable place in the time of the Romans, is manife&s;t from the in&s;criptions in marble, coins, chequered pavements, baths, and highways that have been di&s;covered. It is &s;aid to have been taken from the Britons by Ceaulin, king of the We&s;t Saxons. Penda, the Mercian, afterwards laid &s;iege to it with a great army, but was defeated by Cinegli&s;e, king of the We&s;t-Saxons. It afterwards became &s;ubject to the Mercians, and &s;uffered much from the Danes. Henry III. ordered the ca&s;tle to be razed to the ground. Richard I. was a great benefactor to the town and abbey; as was al&s;o Henry IV. who granted them &s;everal privileges. It was formerly very large, as appears by the walls, which would contain four towns as big as the pre&s;ent. It had al&s;o three churches antiently, of which only one remains, much admired for its lofty tower, chapels, and painted gla&s;s. Its fairs and markets are among the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in the kingdom for wool and cloth, of which a great deal is manufactured in this town. It has had charters from &s;everal kings, and is governed at pre&s;ent by two high|con&s;tables, and fourteen ward&s;men over &s;even wards, cho&s;en yearly at the court-leet. Here is
<PB N="54" REF="540">
a free-&s;chool, and &s;everal alms-hou&s;es. In a mount on the we&s;t-&s;ide, called Gri&s;mund's tower, human bones of a gigantic &s;ize have been found.</P>
<P>Tewk&s;bury &s;tands at the conflux of the Severn and Avon, and had its name from one Theocus, who led the life of a hermit in this place. Here was antiently a famous mona&s;tery, founded in the year 715, by Odo and Dodo, two brothers; and in the year 1470, was fought a bloody battle at this place, betwixt the hou&s;es of York and Lan|ca&s;ter, in which the Lanca&s;trians were defeated. It is a large, populous, well built town, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of three &s;treets, with three bridges leading to it over three rivers, a free-&s;chool, ho&s;pital, and a very large and noble church, in which are &s;eve|ral monuments of great men, particularly of Ed|ward, &s;on of Henry VI. and of the duke of Cla|rence, brother to Edward IV. This corporation was di&s;&s;olved by a proclamation of James II. but at pre&s;ent it is governed by twenty-four burge&s;&s;es, two of whom are cho&s;en bailiffs yearly, who, with two others, are the ruling magi&s;trates, and &s;ole ju&s;tices of the peace within the town. It is famous for the manufacture of woollen-cloth, &s;tockings, and mu&s;tard.</P>
<P>Campden, on the edge of the county next Wor|ce&s;ter&s;hire. The Saxon kings are &s;aid to have had a congre&s;s here in 689, to con&s;ult how to carry on the war again&s;t the Britons. It is a market-town, and has a great manufacture of &s;tockings. Sir Bapti&s;t Hicks, created by Charles I. vi&s;count Campden, was a great benefactor to it, and lies buried in the &s;outh-i&s;le of the church, in which, be&s;ides his, are many other noble monuments of marble. It has a right to the tolls of the fairs on A&s;h-Wedne&s;day and St. Andrew's day, but that of the others belong to the lord of the manor. This town had its charter from James I. and is governed by two
<PB N="55" REF="550">
bailiffs, twelve burge&s;&s;es, and a &s;teward, who have authority to chu&s;e twelve inferior burge&s;&s;es, and to determine in actions for debt not exceed|ing &s;ix pounds thirteen &s;hillings and four-pence. It gives the title of vi&s;count to the earl of Gain&s;|borough.</P>
<P>Newent, in the Fore&s;t of Dean, has its name from an inn, built for the reception of travellers to and from Wales. It &s;tands on a river that falls into the Severn, and is navigable by boats. It is a pretty large place, and has a pari&s;h twenty miles in compa&s;s, containing &s;everal hamlets.</P>
<P>Dean, alias Michael-Dean, is al&s;o in the Fore&s;t, and con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of one &s;treet, with a good church. Pins are its principal manufacture.</P>
<P>Cheltenham, or Chiltenham, is &s;o named from the brook Chilt, which runs thro' the pari&s;h. It is noted chiefly for its malt and mineral waters, which are &s;aid to be of much the &s;ame quality as tho&s;e of Scarborough. There are two other par|ticulars worth mentioning in relation to this place. The fir&s;t is, that the mini&s;ter of the pari&s;h mu&s;t be a fellow of Je&s;us-college, Oxford, nominated by that &s;ociety, and approved of by the earl of Gain&s;|borough, and can hold the living only &s;ix years. The next is, that the manor paid to Edward the Confe&s;&s;or nine pounds a-year, and three thou&s;and loaves for his dogs; and to William the Conqueror twenty pounds a-year, and twenty-five pounds a-year for bread to his dogs.</P>
<P>Stow, on the Would, is a large market-town, &s;aid to have but one element, viz. air; there being neither wood, common-field, nor water belong|ing to it. The forces of Charles I. were routed at this place by tho&s;e of the parliament, March 21, 1648. It has an ho&s;pital, alms-hou&s;e, and free-&s;chool; and its fairs are much frequented for chee&s;e, hops, and &s;heep. The Roman fo&s;&s;e-way pa&s;&s;es thro' it.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="560">
North-leche, on the river Leche, is governed by a bailiff, and two con&s;tables. It has a neat church, &s;everal alms-hou&s;es, and a well endowed free-&s;chool. It is &s;aid that the founder, being in want afterwards, applied to the tru&s;tees to be ap|pointed ma&s;ter of it, but his &s;uit was refu&s;ed</P>
<P>Pain&s;wick, which takes its name from its an|tient lords of the &s;ur-name of Paine, is &s;ituated upon the river Stroud, in a whole&s;ome air. Its &s;ituation is advantageous for carrying on the wool|len manufacture.</P>
<P>Stroud is on the &s;lope of a hill, at the bottom of which is Stroud-water. This water being of a quality that makes it very proper for dying &s;car|let, and other grain colours, is the occa&s;ion that its banks, and this town in particular, are inhabi|ted chiefly by clothiers, who have erected many fulling-mills upon it. It has a hand&s;ome church, a free-&s;chool, and work-hou&s;e in it.</P>
<P>Berkley, an antient borough governed by a mayor and aldermen. The mayor is &s;worn at the court-leet of the earl of Berkley, who is lord of the manor and ca&s;tle, from which he derives both his name and title. It gives name al&s;o to the pa|ri&s;h, which is the large&s;t in the county, and to the hundred, mo&s;t of the towns of which depend up|on it, be&s;ides many others in the &s;hire. The family of Berkley had hardly its equal for antiquity and illu&s;trious de&s;cent, for they have been barons ever &s;ince the reign of Henry II. and quarter in their arms the coats of twenty noble families. Of the great value of the manor to the lord, we may form &s;ome judgment by the fee-farm rent paid to the crown, &s;o early as the reign of Henry II. which was five hundred pounds. Here Edward II. was impri&s;oned, and the little room in the ca&s;tle in which he was murdered, is &s;till to be &s;een. The town and pari&s;h, lying low upon the Severn, are not reckoned very healthy.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="570">
Dur&s;ley, a market-town, famous for cloathing, is a corporation, and is governed by a bailiff and four con&s;tables, but &s;ends no members to par|liament. Here was antiently a ca&s;tle, and there is a field near the town &s;till called Ca&s;tle-field. Here is al&s;o a rock of &s;tone, called by the inhabi|tants puff-&s;tone, which, though &s;oft and ea&s;y to hew, is yet &s;urprizingly durable, as appears from the ca&s;tle of Berkley, which is built with it, and which, though above &s;ix hundred years old, yet di&s;covers no &s;ymptoms of decay. The town gives the title of vi&s;count to the earl of Berkley.</P>
<P>Fairford &s;tands on the Coln, over which it has two large bridges. The church is remarka|ble for its painted gla&s;s, de&s;igned by Albert Du|rer, and taken by one Tame, a merchant, on board a &s;hip bound to Rome, who afterwards pur|cha&s;ed the manor of Henry VIII. and built the church. In the pari&s;h, which is ten miles in com|pa&s;s, are many barrows; and medals and coins are often found in it.</P>
<P>Thornbury is two miles from the Severn, has four &s;mall alms-hou&s;es, a free-&s;chool, and a large church in form of a cathedral. Here a ca&s;tle was begun, but never fini&s;hed, in the reign of Henry VIII. by Edward, duke of Buckingham. It has a titular mayor, twelve aldermen, and two con|&s;tables.</P>
<P>Lechlade, &s;o called from its &s;tanding at the con|flux of the Lech and Thames, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been antiently a Roman town. It is now popu|lous, being a great thoroughfare, and &s;ending butter, chee&s;e, and other goods to London, by the Thames, which begins to be navigable for barges here. In 1670, Laurence Bathur&s;t, e&s;&abque; gave the whole rectory impropriate, to the value of two hundred and forty pounds per annum, to the vicarage of this place.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="580">
Au&s;t &s;tands on a craggy cliff on the banks of the Severn. Here, till very lately, was a ferry over the Severn, which is now two miles lower. As the pa&s;&s;age was antiently at Oldbury, it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Trajectus of Antoninus, oppo|&s;ite to Abone, or Avone, now, probably, the lit|tle village Aventon, or Alvington.</P>
<P>Tetbury &s;tands on a ri&s;ing ground, and is a large hand&s;ome town, but ill provided with water. Here is a great market for yarn, a free-&s;chool, and alms-hou&s;e, and the inhabitants have a right to the tolls of their fairs and markets. A bailiff is cho&s;en yearly for the management of their reve|nues. At King&s;cot near this place, Roman coins have been frequently found, and there is a large camp, called Bury-hill, not far off.</P>
<P>Wotton under Edge is a hand&s;ome town, noted for its woollen manufactures. The chief magi&s;|trate, who is called a mayor, is cho&s;en yearly at the earl of Berkley's court leet. Here is a &s;tately church with &s;ome monuments of the Berkley fa|mily, a free-&s;chool, and alms-hou&s;e. Hugh Per|ry, e&s;quire, an alderman of London, and a na|tive of this place, was a great benefactor to it; as was al&s;o Sir Jonathan Daws and his family.</P>
<P>In the hundred to which this town gives name, lies King&s;wood, a fore&s;t formerly of great extent, but now containing only about five thou&s;and acres, which have been granted to &s;everal gentlemen by patent from the crown, and con&s;i&s;t mo&s;tly of coal mines. The pari&s;h of King&s;wood is tithe-free, in con&s;equence of a grant to an abbey that formerly &s;tood in it, and, though &s;urrounded by Gloce&s;ter|&s;hire, is in the county of Wilts.</P>
<P>At a place called Conham, about a mile from Bri&s;tol, and on the edge of the fore&s;t, are great works for &s;melting copper, making bra&s;s, which are &s;upplied with coal from the fore&s;t, and with the ore from Cornwall and Ireland.</P>

Chipping Sudbury, an antient borough and great thoroughfare. It has a con&s;iderable trade likewi&s;e in coal, lime, chee&s;e, and corn; and it has al&s;o a free-&s;chool. The bailiffs and burghers have a power to a&s;&s;ign eighty-eight cow-pa&s;tures to as many of the inhabitants, and eight acres of meadow for their own lives and tho&s;e of their widows, and to grant them to others as they fall.</P>
<P>Mar&s;hfield is con&s;iderable for its manufacture of malt and cloth, and is famous for cakes. It is governed by a bailiff, who has power to puni&s;h delinquents within its liberties.</P>

<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES and CURIOSITIES.</HEAD>
<P>The pari&s;h of Clifton near Bri&s;tol, is noted for the hot-well, and tho&s;e &s;tupendous rocks upon the Avon, called St. Vincent's rocks, on the top of which is a fortification and a camp. Near Tewke&s;|bury, on the top of a hill called Towbery-hill, is an encampment; and in the Severn is the i&s;le of Alney, where Edmund, king of the Engli&s;h, and Canute, king of the Danes, agreed to deter|mine their right to the kingdom by &s;ingle com|bat. Not far from Stroud, in the pari&s;h of Bi&s;|ley, was born the famous friar Bacon, and edu|cated at St. Mary's chapel, now St. Bury-mill, on Stroud-water. On the hills near Alderley, at the head of the little river Avon, are &s;tones re&s;em|bling cockles and oy&s;ters. At Alderley was born the famous Sir Matthew Hale, lord chief ju&s;tice of England. In the pari&s;h of Avel&s;ton near Au&s;t, is a large round camp, and another, not far frem thence, at Ca&s;tle hill. In the pari&s;h of Puckle-church, was antiently a royal villa, where Edmund, king of England, was killed with a dagger, as he interpo&s;ed between his &s;ewer and one Leof, a notorions outlaw. About three

miles from Bri&s;tol, is Penpark-hole, which is a va&s;t cavity, &s;eventy-five yards in length, forty in breadth, and nineteen in height, the mouth of which is forty yards deep, but very narrow. At Woodche&s;ter, not far from Gloce&s;ter, was di&s;covered anno 1722, a curious mo&s;aic pave|ment, repre&s;enting birds and bea&s;ts in their natu|ral colours, and another &s;ince at Cromhall, &s;ix|teen miles from Gloce&s;ter. At Henbury, two miles from St. Vincent's rocks, is a camp with three rampires, or trenches. Near Derham, in the pari&s;h of Old Al&s;ton, a hole, like the tunnel of a chimney, was di&s;covered in ploughing, thro' which, &s;ome per&s;ons being let down, found a ca|vity extending half a mile. At Tormarton, a lit|tle to the north of Derham, are &s;tones re&s;embling bullets, others with cockle-&s;hells incorporated into them, and a petrifying &s;pring. Coins are often ploughed up at Lemington, where there &s;eems to have been a &s;tation of the Romans. In the garden of the manor-hou&s;e at Wickmar, is a che&s;nut-tree, which mea&s;ures nineteen yards about, and at Slymbridge, on the Severn, is a family of the name, which, for many generations, has had five fingers and a thumb upon each hand. At Farmington, near North Lech, is an exceeding large Roman camp called Norbury.</P>

<P>Oxford, &s;o celebrated for its univer&s;ity, is plea|&s;antly &s;eated in a plain with a fine fruitful country all around. The compo&s;ition of the name is ob|vious. In the Briti&s;h times it &s;eems to have been a place of &s;tudy; but in the Saxon aera, it was noted only for a religious hou&s;e dedicated to St. Fride&s;wide, till Alfred built three colleges, one for grammarians, another for philo&s;ophers, and a third for divines. Learning continued to flou|ri&s;h till the city was &s;acked and burnt by the Danes in the reign of Etheldred, and after that Harold, &s;urnamed Harefoot, treated it with great &s;everity upon &s;ome provocation he had received. It &s;eems to have been be&s;ieged and taken by Wil|liam the Conqueror, and to have been de&s;erted by the learned from that time till about the year 1129, when one Robert Pulein began to read lectures in divinity; and &s;uch was the re&s;ort of &s;tu|dents to it, that in the reign of king John, there were not fewer than three thou&s;and. Robert d'Oily, a Norman, to whom William the Con|queror had given the greate&s;t part of it, built a ca&s;tle on the we&s;t &s;ide in 1071; and he is al&s;o &s;up|po&s;ed to have &s;urrounded it with walls. In a pa|lace built by Henry I. was born Richard I. commonly called Coeur de Lion. About the tenth of king John, there happened a quarrel between the citizens and &s;tudents, in con&s;equence of which many of the latter quitted it, but returned again
<PB N="65" REF="650">
a few years afterwards. Here Henry III. held a parliament to &s;ettle the differences betwixt him and his barons, when he confirmed the privileges granted to the univer&s;ity by his predece&s;&s;ors, and added others of his own. In this reign the &s;tu|dents are &s;aid to have been thirty thou&s;and, who were all excommunicated by the pope for &s;ome rudene&s;s to his legate. In Edward III's time, they were &s;plit into two factions, called the northern and &s;outhern men, a divi&s;ion which was attended with many di&s;orders and much violence, but in a &s;hort time concord and harmony again prevailed. As colleges began about this time to be founded and endowed, we &s;hall here pre&s;ent our readers with a li&s;t of them, together with the time when, and per&s;ons by whom they were founded.</P>

<P>Worce&s;ter was called Glouce&s;ter-hall till lately, that it was endowed by Sir Thomas Coke, and made collegiate.</P>
<P>Hartford was Hart-hall till 1740, that it was erected into a college.</P>
<P>All the&s;e are richly endowed, and have fine gardens, libraries, chapels, &amp;c. The halls, in which the &s;tudents maintain them&s;elves, except a few that have exhibitions, are the&s;e: St. Ed|mund's, belonging to Queen's college; Magda|len, to Magdalen-college; St. Alban's, to Mer|ton; St. Mary's, to Oriel; New-Inn, to New|college. Several per&s;ons have been great bene|factors to particular colleges, as Dr. Ratcliffe to Univer&s;ity-college; colonel Codrington and Dr. Clarke, to All-Souls; queen Caroline, to Queen's; the before-mentioned Dr. Clarke and Mrs. Eaton, to Worce&s;ter; Dr. Wake, archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury, to Chri&s;t-Church. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the&s;e colleges are Magdalen's and Chri&s;t-Church, which are as noble foundations as any in the world. The church of the latter is the ca|thedral, and has a dean, eight canons, eight chaplains, eight &s;inging men, eight choiri&s;ters, a teacher of mu&s;ick, and an organi&s;t. Each of the colleges has its vi&s;itor appointed by its &s;tatutes, except Chri&s;t-Church, which is &s;ubject to the vi|&s;itation of the &s;overeign alone. The other remark|able buildings belonging to the univer&s;ity are; fir&s;t, the public &s;chools; &s;econdly, the Bodleian or pub|lic library; thirdly, Ratcliffe's library, a mo&s;t ele|gant &s;tructure, for building and furni&s;hing which Dr. Ratcliffe left forty thou&s;and pounds; fourthly,
<PB N="66" REF="670">
the theatre, built by Sheldon, archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury; fifthly, the mu&s;eum, in which is an ela|boratory and a repo&s;itory for natural and artificial rarities and antiquities; &s;ixthly, the Clarendon printing hou&s;e, &s;o called, becau&s;e it was built partly with the money ari&s;ing to the univer&s;ity by the &s;ale of lord Clarendon's hi&s;tory. To the &s;outh of Mag|dalen college lies the phy&s;ic garden, in&s;tituted by the earl of Danby, and much improved by Dr. Sherrard. It contains five acres, in which is a compleat &s;eries of &s;uch plants as grow naturally, di&s;po&s;ed in their re&s;pective cla&s;&s;es; together with two neat and convenient green-hou&s;es, &s;tocked with a valuable collection of exotics, and a hot|hou&s;e, where various plants brought from the warmer climates are rai&s;ed. The whole body of the univer&s;ity, including profe&s;&s;ors, fellows, and &s;tu|dents of all &s;orts, exceeds three thou&s;and. Each college has its particular &s;tatutes and rules for its government. There are four terms in the year for public exerci&s;es, &amp;c. and particular days and hours for public lectures by the &s;everal profe&s;&s;ors. The univer&s;ity is governed by a chancellor, high-&s;teward, vice-chancellor, two proctors, a public orator, a keeper of the archives, a regi&s;ter, three '&s;quire|beadles, and three yeomen-beadles. As to the city, it has had the &s;ame privileges granted to it as London, particularly an exemption from toll all over England. It is governed by a mayor, high-&s;teward, recorder, four aldermen, eight a&s;|&s;i&s;tants, two bailiffs, a town-clerk, two chamber|lains, all that have borne the office of bailiff and chamberlain, and twenty-four common-council men; but the&s;e are &s;ubject to the chancellor or vice-chancellor of the univer&s;ity in all affairs of moment: and not only the mayor, but the prin|cipal citizens, and &s;heriff of the county, take an oath to maintain the privileges of the univer&s;ity. The city, including the colleges, is one of the
<PB N="67" REF="680">
large&s;t in England, having thirteen pari&s;h churches, be&s;ides the cathedral, well-built, clean, and re|gular. At the entrance of the town from the Wood&s;tock and Banbury roads, a neat ho&s;pital hath been lately erected by the tru&s;tees of Dr. Ratcliffe's benefaction, out of the &s;urplus money remaining after defraying the expence of his library. The male|line of the family of Vere, to whom the city had given the title of earl for five hundred years, failing in Aubrey de Vere, who was twentieth earl, queen Anne conferred the title upon Robert Harley, a de&s;cendant of the Veres, in who&s;e family it &s;till continues. The chief trade of the city is in malt, conveyed in barges to London.</P>
<P>New Wood&s;tock, &s;ignifying a woody place, is &s;eated upon a &s;mall brook that falls into the Even|lode. In this town king Etheldred is &s;aid to have held an a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates, and Alfred to have tran&s;lated Boetius de Con&s;olatione Philo&s;ophiae. King Henry I. built a palace here, and enclo&s;ed a large park with a &s;tone wall, which &s;ome think to have been the fir&s;t that was rai&s;ed in England. Henry II. is &s;aid to have built a labyrinth here to conceal the fair Ro&s;amond from the re&s;tle&s;s jea|lou&s;y of his queen. The park and manor conti|nued in the crown, till queen Anne, by act of parliament, be&s;towed them upon the duke of Marlborough, as a reward for his eminent and un|paralleled &s;ervices. A very noble and magnifi|cent hou&s;e was al&s;o erected for him at the public expence within the manor, called, from the great victory obtained over the French and Bavarians at Blenheim, upon the Danube, Blenheim-hou&s;e, or ca&s;tle. The gardens and other ornaments are in all re&s;pect &s;uited to the grandeur and magnifi|cence of the hou&s;e, the furniture of which is al&s;o extremely fine, e&s;pecially the tape&s;try hangings, repre&s;enting the duke's battles. For the manor and ca&s;tle the duke's de&s;cendants are obliged, by
<PB N="68" REF="690">
way of homage, to pre&s;ent yearly a &s;tandard to the &s;overeign on the day on which the battle of Blenheim was fought. Upon a va&s;t obeli&s;k in the park is in&s;cribed a &s;hort account of the duke's exploits and character; and at the principal en|trance from the town is a &s;tately triumphal arch erected to his memory. The Roman highway, called Akeman &s;treet, pa&s;&s;es through this park. The town is large and well built, has a manu|facture of poli&s;hed &s;teel wares and gloves; and is governed by a mayor, high &s;teward, recorder, four aldermen, two chamberlains, and &s;ixteen com|mon-council. It is noted for being the birth|place of Edmund, &s;on to Edward I. &s;urnamed of Wood&s;tock; of Edward the Black Prince, and his brother Thomas of Wood&s;tock; and the poet Chaucer. Here queen Elizabeth was confined by her &s;i&s;ter queen Mary. His grace the duke of Portland takes the title of vi&s;count from hence.</P>
<P>Banbury &s;tands upon the Cherwell. Here was a ca&s;tle built by Alexander, bi&s;hop of Lincoln; and about three miles from hence was fought that battle, in which the earl of Warwick defeated Edward IV. and the Lanca&s;trian party. The an|tiquity of the place appears from the coins of Ro|man emperors often found in the adjoining fields. It had its fir&s;t charter from queen Mary, the next from James I. and the third and la&s;t, from George I. in con&s;equence of which, it is now go|verned by a mayor, high-&s;teward, recorder, &s;ix capital burge&s;&s;es, and thirty a&s;&s;i&s;tants. Being &s;urrounded with rich meadows, it was antiently, and is &s;till, noted for excellent chee&s;e.</P>
<P>Whitney &s;tands upon the Windru&s;h, and is an antient town. It &s;ent members to parliament till the thirty-third of Edward III. So much wool is &s;pun here for rugs and blankets, for which the town is noted, that above a hundred packs are
<PB N="69" REF="700">
&s;aid to be con&s;umed in a week. Their rugs and blankets are greatly admired, and employ a va&s;t number of hands in and about the town. They have al&s;o a manufacture of duffils, of tilts for bargemen, and cuts for hammocks. Great quantities of &s;heep-&s;kins are likewi&s;e dre&s;&s;ed and &s;tained here, and made into breeches and jackets. Near this place lies Whichwood-fore&s;t, antiently of great extent, but now much reduced.</P>
<P>Henley &s;tands upon the Thames, in the extre|mity of the county. Dr. Plot &s;uppo&s;es it to be the olde&s;t own in it, and Dr. Gale will have it to be the Galleva Atrebatum of Antoninus, on ac|count of the Roman coins found here, and the military way that runs from Spinae to this place. The inhabitants are mo&s;tly malt&s;ters, bargemen, and mealmen; and va&s;t quantities of corn, malt, meal, and wood, are conveyed from hence to London. Its market is one of the greate&s;t in England for corn. It is a thriving well built town, governed by a warden, burge&s;&s;es, and other officers; and has two free-&s;chools and an alms-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Dorche&s;ter &s;tands upon the Tame, and appears from the coins frequently found about it, to have been a Roman &s;tation. In the Saxon times it was the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, which was removed in the time of William the Conqueror to Lincoln. Here was antiently an abbey of regular canons. It is &s;aid no &s;nakes or venemous creatures have ever been &s;een about it. However, it is now but a mean incon&s;iderable place.</P>
<P>Burford is &s;ituated upon the Windru&s;h. Near this town at a place, &s;till called Battle-Edge, Athelbald, king of the We&s;t Saxons, as it is thought, was entirely defeated by Cuthred, king of the Mercians. Here too a council was con|vened in 685 by the kings Etheldred and Berth|wald. It had a charter from Henry II. and is go|verned
<PB N="70" REF="710">
at pre&s;ent by two bailiffs and other inferior officers. Its market is noted for &s;addles, and the neighbouring downs for hor&s;e-races, by which the town is much benefited. It was the birth-place of Dr. Heylin, author of the Co&s;mography, &amp;c. and gives title of earl to the duke of St. Albans.</P>
<P>Chipping-Norton &s;eems to derive the fir&s;t part of its name from the Saxon word ceapan, to cheapen, and to have been antiently a market. It is now governed by two bailiffs and inferior officers, who have power to determine actions under four pounds value. It is &s;aid to have had both a ca&s;tle and mona&s;tery formerly, and Roman coins are often found about it.</P>
<P>Tame is &s;eated plea&s;antly on the river from which it derives its name. It was much indebted to Lexington, bi&s;hop of Lincoln, who brought the great road through it, which before lay at &s;ome di&s;tance. It has a free-&s;chool and alms-hou&s;e founded by lord Williams, of Tame, in the reign of queen Elizabeth, and is a large town, with a good market, the river being navigable to it by barges.</P>

<P>Hogs-Norton is memorable for the &s;laughter of the Engli&s;h by the Danes in 917. Its inhabitants

<P>At Wood-Eaton, four miles from Oxford, &s;ome of the coins of Cunobeline have been found, hav|ing on one &s;ide a hor&s;e with an ear of corn over him, and the word Cuno under him; and on the re|ver&s;e another &s;uch ear, with Camu for Camulodu|num, or Malden, in E&s;&s;ex, where they were &s;truck.</P>
<P>In the we&s;t corner of the county, near Chip|ping-Norton, the four counties of Oxford, Glo|ce&s;ter, Worce&s;ter, and Warwick meet; and the boundaries of each are marked by a &s;tone, which are therefore called the four &s;hire &s;tones.</P>

<HEAD>BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>This county, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to derive its name from the Saxon word Buc, denoting a hart or buck, is bounded on the &s;outh by Berk&s;hire, from which it is parted by the Thames; on the we&s;t by Oxford&s;hire; on the north by Northamp|ton&s;hire; on the ea&s;t by Bedford&s;hire, Hertford|&s;hire, and Middle&s;ex. Its length is thirty-nine miles, breadth eighteen, and circumference one
<PB N="74" REF="750">
hundred and thirty-eight, in which &s;pace it con|tains four hundred and forty-one thou&s;and acres, eight hundreds, three to the &s;outh and five to the north of the Chiltern, eleven market-towns, &s;ix parliamentary boroughs, one hundred and eighty|five pari&s;hes, and about one hundred and eleven thou&s;and three hundred &s;ouls. The boroughs are Buckingham, Chipping - Wycomb, Ayle&s;|&s;bury, Agmonde&s;ham, Wendover, and Great-Marlow, each of which &s;ends two members to parliament, and the county two, in all fourteen. It lies in the dioce&s;e of Lincoln, and Norfolk cir|cuit, and gives the title of earl to the family of Hobart.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The air is good, e&s;pecially upon the Chiltern: but tho' in the vale the air may not be altogether &s;o pure and &s;erene as upon the hills, the &s;oil is much more fruitful; yet that of the Chiltern is far from being barren, for, be&s;ides feeding large flocks of &s;heep, it produces very good wheat and barley. The meadows of the vale are among the riche&s;t pa&s;tures of England, as the &s;heep are among the large&s;t, tho' the mutton is not &s;o good as that of the Downs, nor the beef equal to that of So|mer&s;et&s;hire. The Chiltern was formerly over-run with wood, and infamous for being a harbour for thieves; but it hath been long cleared both of the one and the other. The graziers of the vale are as con&s;iderable as any in England; and their herds of cattle as numerous and of as large a &s;ize. The county is al&s;o well furni&s;hed with wood and water, &s;o that it is inferior to few in England. The chief manufactures are paper and bone|lace; the la&s;t of which is almo&s;t equal to that of Flanders.</P>

<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Buckingham, the county town, &s;tands on the Ou&s;e, by which it is almo&s;t &s;urrounded. Edward the Elder fortified it in the year 918 with a ram|part and turrets, again&s;t the incur&s;ions of the Danes. It &s;eems, however, to have been but an incon&s;iderable place at the conque&s;t; for, accord|ing to Doom&s;day-book, it paid only for one hide, and had but twenty-&s;ix burge&s;&s;es. It had former|ly a ca&s;tle in the middle of the town, of which &s;carce any ve&s;tiges now remain. The &s;hrine of St. Rumbald, the patron of fi&s;hermen, pre&s;erved in its church, was held in great veneration. The town is now large and populous, has three bridges over the Ou&s;e, a free-&s;chool, and town-hall, a hand&s;ome &s;tructure, in which the weights and mea&s;ures of the county are kept by act of parliament. The county gaol &s;tands in this town, and here the a&s;&s;izes are &s;ome|times kept. It was formerly a &s;taple for wool, but taht advantage it hath now lo&s;t. It is governed by a bailiff, and twelve burge&s;&s;es, who are the &s;ole electors of the members. In its neighbourhood are many paper-mills upon the Ou&s;e.</P>
<P>Chipping-Wycomb, or High-Wickham, is &s;i|tuated upon a &s;mall river, in a low ground, &s;ur|rounded with plea&s;ant hills. It is an antient, large, well-built, wealthy town, was made a free borough by Henry I. and began to &s;end members to parliament the 28th of Edward I. The manor is held of the dean and canons of Wind&s;or, to whom the corporation pay a quit-rent of twenty|&s;ix
<PB N="76" REF="770">
pounds per annum. It is governed by a mayor, recorder, twelve aldermen, a town-clerk, and two bailiffs, with a common-council. Its market is &s;o con&s;iderable, e&s;pecially for corn, that the toll of it was many years ago let for a hundred and fifty pounds, be&s;ides one hundred pounds fine. It is a great thoroughfare upon the Oxford-road, and there are many mills for paper and corn in the neighbourhood. Mo&s;t of the flour made here is conveyed in barges from Marlow to London. There is a free-grammar-&s;chool, with &s;everal alms-hou&s;es, endowed with lands that formerly belonged to a mona&s;tery and an ho&s;pital of St. John of Jeru&s;alem. The a&s;&s;izes are &s;ometimes kept at this place; and near the town, in 1724, was di&s;covered a curious te&s;&s;elated pavement.</P>
<P>Ayle&s;bury &s;tands at the ea&s;t-end of the vale, not far from the river Tame, on a ri&s;ing ground, &s;ur|rounded by rich meadows and pa&s;tures. It was antiently famous for St. Adith, who was &s;o cele|brated for her &s;anctity, that &s;he is reported to have performed many miracles. Some lands, we are told, were antiently held here, on condition that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or &s;hould provide &s;traw for the king's bed three times a-year, if he &s;hould come &s;o often thither. If he came in winter, he was al&s;o to &s;traw his chamber, and find him three eels; if in &s;um|mer, he was to provide &s;weet herbs for his cham|ber, and two green gee&s;e. Chief-ju&s;tice Baldwin was a great benefactor to this town; for he not only built the town-hall, and made a cau&s;ey for three miles towards London, but brought the a&s;&s;izes and &s;e&s;&s;ions hither, much to the advantage of the inhabitants. The corporation, by virtue of its charter from queen Mary, in January 1553-4, con&s;i&s;ts of a bailiff, ten aldermen, and twelve capital burge&s;&s;es.

<P>Bedford, the county town, &s;tands on each &s;ide of the Ou&s;e, over which it has a &s;tone bridge. It is an antient town, and plea&s;antly &s;ituated, but not very large nor well built; tho' the buildings are much improved of late, and the river made navigable. It has two weekly markets, the one on Tue&s;day for live cattle, and the other on Sa|turday for corn; of which the former is held on the &s;outh &s;ide of the river, and the other on the north. At this place the Britons were overthrown in a great battle, in 572, by Cuthwulf, the Saxon king; and here was a &s;trong ca&s;tle, built in the time of the Normans by Pagan de Beauchamp, the third baron of Bedford. It was reduced by king Stephen after a long &s;iege, and afterwards by king John, after a &s;iege of &s;ixty days, from Fulco de Brent, who rebelled again&s;t his &s;overeign, notwith&s;tanding he had taken this ca&s;tle before from the barons, and had it be&s;towed upon him by the king. The town is a very antient corporation, and has long &s;ent members to parliament. It is governed at pre&s;ent by a mayor, recorder, two bailiffs, twelve aldermen, two chamberlains, a town-clerk, and three &s;erjeants. The neighbouring country is

<P>Hartford, &s;ignifying, as is commonly thought, the ford of Harts, &s;tands on the river Lea. In Wil|liam the Conqueror's time, as we find in Doom&s;|day-book, there were twenty-&s;ix burge&s;&s;es in it. It has a ca&s;tle upon the Lea, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been built by Edward the Elder, which Edward III. granted to his &s;on John, duke of Lanca&s;ter, to|gether with the town and honour of Hartford, that (as it is expre&s;&s;ed in the grant) he might keep a hou&s;e &s;uitable to his quality, and have a decent habitation. Here the Ea&s;t Saxon kings often kept their court; and where, in 673, was held a &s;y|nod. King Edward the Elder built a village for his tenants, and fortified it with a wall of turf for their defence, which is what was originally meant by a burgh, whence the hou&s;es were called burgages, and the inhabitants burghers or burge&s;&s;es. The ma|nor of this town was an honour and a royal manor,
<PB N="87" REF="880">
and even the town and ca&s;tle were held of the king in capite; of the latter of which the &s;heriffs of Hartford&s;hire and E&s;&s;ex were u&s;ually governors. The manor was granted by queen Elizabeth to lord Burleigh, who&s;e de&s;cendants &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s it. The town &s;ent members to parliament in Edward the I&s;t's time, but after the &s;eventh of Henry V. the bailiff and burge&s;&s;es petitioned the parliament to be excu&s;ed, on account of their poverty. It has had &s;everal charters and grants of privileges from different kings, particularly &s;everal fairs and markets. In Henry VII's reign, the &s;tandards of weights and mea&s;ures were ordered to be kept here. Here was antiently a mona&s;tery, founded by a ne|phew of William the Conqueror's, and five churches, which are now reduced to two. As the town is re|markable for its plea&s;ant dry &s;ituation and whole|&s;ome air, the governors of Chri&s;t's ho&s;pital have fitted up a large building for the reception of their &s;ickly or &s;upernumarary children. It is governed at pre&s;ent by a mayor, high-&s;teward, recorder, nine aldermen, a town-clerk, chamberlain, ten capital burge&s;&s;es, and &s;ixteen a&s;&s;i&s;tants; and it has two &s;erjeants at mace. Its markets are very con&s;iderable for wool, wheat, and malt, of which, e&s;pecially the la&s;t, great quantities are conveyed to London by the river Lea. The town has had a great many benefactors; but to particularize them and their benefactions, would require more room than we can allow. It gives the title of earl to the noble family of Seymour-Conway.</P>
<P>St. Alban's ro&s;e out of the ruins of the antient city of Verolamium, upon Offa, king of the Mer|cians, founding a mona&s;tery near it, about the year 795, in a place called Holmehur&s;t, to the memory of St. Alban, who was the fir&s;t Briti&s;h martyr in the reign of Diocle&s;ian. Together with the mona&s;tery, a town grew up, which from
<PB N="88" REF="890">
the &s;aint took the name of St. Alban's. From the veneration paid to this &s;aint, and the great po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and immunities be&s;towed by kings and popes in con|&s;equence thereof upon the mona&s;tery, it became one of the wealthie&s;t and mo&s;t eminent in Britain, if not in the world. Pope Adrian, who was born near it, gave the abbot the precedence of all the other abbots in England, u&s;ing the&s;e words: "As St. Alban is well known to have been the proto mar|tyr of the Engli&s;h nation, &s;o the abbot of his mo|na&s;tery &s;hould in all times be reputed the fir&s;t in dignity of all the abbots of England." Here two battles were fought between the hou&s;es of York and Lanca&s;ter; in the fir&s;t, Richard, duke of York, defeated the Lanca&s;trian party with great &s;laughter, and took king Henry VI. pri&s;oner; but four years after, the Lanca&s;trians, under the conduct of queen Margaret, routed the Yorki&s;ts, and recovered the king. The church, a large, beautiful, antient pile, was purcha&s;ed at the di&s;&s;o|lution of mona&s;teries, by the inhabitants for four hundred pounds, and converted into a pari&s;h church. How amazingly durable the Roman bricks are, appears from this church, which, tho' built in 793, from the walls of Old Verulam, is &s;till &s;tanding. In it are a great number of in&s;crip|tions and monuments of kings, &amp;c. particularly tho&s;e of Offa, the Saxon king, St. Alban, and Humphrey, duke of Gloce&s;ter. There are three other pari&s;h churches, in one of which, St. Mi|chael's, is an alaba&s;ter monument of the illu&s;|trious Bacon, lord vi&s;count Verulam. The town has had &s;everal charters, by the la&s;t of which it is governed by a mayor, high-&s;teward, recorder, twelve aldermen, and twenty-four a&s;&s;i&s;tants. One of its weekly markets is among the greate&s;t in England for wheat. To the liberty of this town belongs both a civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction

over a great many neighbouring pari&s;hes, with a gaol and gaol-delivery held at St. Alban's four times a year. Not far from the town are the re|mains called vulgarly Oe&s;ter-hills, as is &s;uppo&s;ed from O&s;torius the propraetor.

<P>At Roy&s;ton was formerly a cro&s;s built by a lady of the name of Roy&s;ia, and thence called Roy&s;ia's cro&s;s; but a mona&s;tery having been after|wards built in the &s;ame place, and in con&s;equence of that a town, it took the name of Roy&s;ton. Richard I. granted it a fair and market, which was once one of the greate&s;t in the kingdom for corn and malt. It is a neat town, &s;tanding at the extremity of the county, on the confines of Cambridge&s;hire. The church, which antiently belonged to the pri|ory, and has many fine monuments in it, was purcha&s;ed by the inhabitants at the di&s;&s;olution, and converted, by act of parliament, into a pari&s;h church. The rectory, of which the dean and chapter of St. Paul's are patrons, is very valua|ble, con&s;i&s;ting of five pari&s;hes reduced into one. Here, we are told by Norden, that the be&s;t wheat was &s;old for a &s;hilling a quarter in Henry VI's time. The Roman way, called Ermine-&s;treet, pa&s;&s;es thro' this hundred; and that called Icken|ing-&s;treet a little to the ea&s;t of the town, along which, and in the fields about the town, are a great many barrows.

<P>Hitchin, or Hitching, a corruption of Hitchend, from its &s;tanding at the end of Hitch-wood, is e&s;teemed the &s;econd town of the county, for its extent and number of inhabitants. It is governed by a bailiff and four con&s;tables. The market is very con&s;iderable for malt and corn, and the more &s;o, as no toll is paid for grain of any kind. The town and manor belonged formerly to the Baliol family; but when John Baliol became king of Scotland, they reverted to the crown, in which, or in &s;ome of the royal family, they have ever &s;ince continued. It has a hand&s;ome church, free-&s;chool, and &s;everal alms-hou&s;es well endowed. About the town is found marle of &s;everal &s;orts.</P>
<P>Buntingford is a &s;mall town, &s;ituated upon Er|mine-&s;treet.

<P>Bi&s;hops-Stortford is a con&s;iderable place, with four &s;treets pointing to the four quarters, good inns, and a market. It takes the name of Stortford from its &s;ituation on the Stort, and the epithet of Bi&s;hops from its having belonged to the bi&s;hops of Lon|don ever &s;ince the conque&s;t. There was antiently a ca&s;tle belonging al&s;o to the bi&s;hop, for the guard of which he had certain rents a&s;&s;igned him out of &s;everal manors, and in which was a pri&s;on, called the convicts pri&s;on, becau&s;e the bi&s;hops u&s;ed to put &s;uch as were convicted of here&s;y into it. King John incorporated the town, and al&s;o authorized it to &s;end members to parliament; but it hath &s;ince lo&s;t the&s;e privileges.

<P>Berkham&s;ted, a corruption of Bergham&s;ted, that is, a village or town upon a hill, is an antient town. In 697 was held at this place a &s;ynod of the clergy; and, in the time of William the Conqueror, the nobles had a meeting about throwing off the Nor|man yoke, to which William came in per&s;on, and &s;wore upon the reliques of the church of St. Alban's, and the holy Evangeli&s;ts, that he would inviolably ob&s;erve all the good, approved, and antient laws of the kingdom; but to this oath he &s;hewed little regard afterwards. Henry II. kept his court here, and granted the town a great many privileges and immunities. Robert, earl of Morton, half-brother to the Conqueror, is &s;aid to have built a ca&s;tle in it. The town and honour have been con&s;tantly in the crown &s;ince the year 1308; and his royal highne&s;s the duke of Cum|berland derives his title of marquis from hence. In the manor and honour are comprized no fewer than fifty-three town&s;hips, partly in this county, partly in Bucks, and partly in Northampton&s;hire. The town is pretty large, and a corporation, though a poor one. It has a &s;tately church, an alms-hou&s;e, and free-&s;chool, well endowed, of which the king is patron, and the warden of All-&s;ouls college, Oxford, vi&s;itor.</P>

Ware, &s;o called, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, from a &s;ort of dam antiently made there to &s;top the current, commonly called a wear, is a flouri&s;hing place, being a great thoroughfare, and &s;tanding on the river Lea, which is navigable from hence. This town never began to make any figure till the time of king John, when, under the protection of its lord Sayer de Quincy, earl of Winche&s;ter, it turn|ed the high road hither: for before that time it was only a &s;mall village, and no waggons could pa&s;s the bridge by rea&s;on of a chain acro&s;s it, the key whereof was kept by the bailiff of Hartford. From hence the New-river water is conveyed for &s;ixty miles, taking in the windings to London, and greatly contributes to its cleanline&s;s, health, and convenience. The town has a weekly market, and pye-powder court, view of frank pledges, waife and &s;tray, free-warren, and the neighbouring park. Its market is a very great one for corn, of which and malt prodigious quantities are conveyed in barges to London by the river Lea. Here is a famous bed, much vi&s;ited by travellers, and is &s;o large, that twenty couple may lie at ea&s;e in it. Be&s;ides a church, there are &s;everal alms-hou&s;es, and a charity &s;chool.</P>

It is one of the greate&s;t mar|kets in England for wheat, a con&s;iderable quantity of which is ground here, and conveyed to London, and has be&s;ides a manufacture of &s;traw-hats, which employs and &s;upports a great number of hands.</P>

<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES.</HEAD>
<P>The principal place for antiquities in this county is the antient Verulamium near St. Alban's, which was formerly a very famous city. In Nero's time it was e&s;teemed a municipium, that is, a town who&s;e inhabitants enjoyed the rights and privi|leges of Roman citizens. When the Britons re|volted from the Romans under Boadicea, they de&s;troyed it entirely; but afterwards it flouri&s;hed again, and aro&s;e to a great degree of eminence. Roman antiquities of all &s;orts have been found here, and many are &s;till found to this day.</P>

<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Colche&s;ter, thought by &s;ome to be the place mentioned by Antoninus under the name of Co|lonia, different from Colonia Camaloduni, and by the Saxons called Caer Colin, is a beautiful, po|pulous, plea&s;ant town, the capital of the county, extended on the brow of a hill from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and adorned with ten churches. It had formerly &s;trong walls and a ca&s;tle, but now there are hard|ly any remains of either. From the coins and Roman bricks found here, it appears very plainly to have been a Roman &s;tation. This place is &s;aid to have given birth to Fl. Julia Helena, mother to Con&s;tantine the Great, and daughter to king Coelus, &s;o much celebrated for her piety and zeal in propagating the Chri&s;tian religion. Here, and in the neighbouring towns, is a great manu|facture of bays and &s;ays, which employs a va&s;t number of hands in carding, &s;pinning, and wea|ving, and yields very valuable returns. This town is al&s;o famous for oy&s;ters, in pickling and barrel|ling of which the inhabitants excel. The render|ing navagable the river Colne, on which it &s;tands, has greatly contributed to the promoting its trade and manufactures. It is a liberty of it&s;elf, and by virtue of its la&s;t charter from king William, is governed by a mayor, high-&s;teward, recorder, or his deputy, eleven aldermen, a chamberlain, town-clerk, eighteen a&s;&s;i&s;tants, and eighteen com|mon-council men. There was formerly an abbey here, who&s;e abbot was mitred, and &s;at in parliament. In the time of the civil wars it was be&s;ieged by the parliament's troops, and reduced by famine.

There are two free-grammar &s;chools in it, a work|hou&s;e, and two charity &s;chools. The woollen manufacturers are &s;uch devourers of &s;prats, that the&s;e fi&s;h commonly go here by the name of the weavers beef of Colche&s;ter.</P>
<P>Malden, or Maldon, is an antient city, and was the chief &s;eat of Cunobeline, the Briti&s;h king, but was reduced by the emperor Claudius, and made a Roman colony, called Colonia Camalodu|num; but when the Britons revolted under Boa|dicia, it was plundered and burnt: however, the Romans rai&s;ed it out of its a&s;hes again, for it is mentioned by Antoninus long after. It was ruined again in the Dani&s;h wars, but repaired and fortifi|ed with a ca&s;tle by Edward, &s;on to king Alfred. In William the Conqueror's time, we find by Doom&s;day-book, that it had one hundred and eighty hou&s;es, held by burghers, and eighteen man&s;ions laid wa&s;te. It is now a con&s;iderable town, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of one &s;treet, and has a pretty convenient harbour. It is al&s;o a liberty of it&s;elf, and a corporation, governed by two bailiffs, &s;ix alder|men, eighteen headboroughs, a &s;teward, recorder, and four hundred burge&s;&s;es, who vote for its mem|bers of parliament. Here is a grammar-&s;chool, a work-hou&s;e, a large library for the u&s;e of the clergy of the town and neighbourhood; and a con&s;idera|ble trade is carried on in coals, iron, corn, and deals. In a neighbouring bay are bred tho&s;e delicate oy&s;ters, called Walfleet oy&s;ters, from a wall of earth rai&s;ed to keep out the &s;ea. The cu&s;tom called Bo|rough Engli&s;h takes place here, by which the younge&s;t &s;on &s;ucceeds his father in his lands and tenements if he dies inte&s;tate.</P>

Here is a dock belonging to the government, with all conveniences for building, cleaning, and re|fitting men of war. A little way from the town, on a high hill, called Beacon-hill, is a very fine light hou&s;e, which is &s;een at a great di&s;tance, and is very u&s;eful on this dangerous coa&s;t. At this place the packet-boats, that pa&s;s between England, Holland, and Germany, are &s;tationed, and the town is much benefited by the pa&s;&s;engers. The government, by a charter from king James I, is ve&s;ted in a mayor, eight aldermen, twenty-four capital burge&s;&s;es, the electors, and recorder. The town has al&s;o an admiralty juri&s;diction within its liberties, and the return of all writs, fines, &amp;c. At Walton, about five miles to the &s;outh of Har|wich, there are works for making copperas; and at Warbne&s;s, in its neighbourhood, in 1701, bones of an extraordinary &s;ize were found, &s;up|po&s;ed to be the bones of &s;ome of tho&s;e elephants that were brought into Britain by the emperor Claudius. In Thorp, Kirby, and Walton, to the &s;outh of Harwich, no man can be arre&s;ted but by the bailiff, with the con&s;ent of the lord, they be|ing within that which was antiently called the li|berty of this Soke.</P>

In the reign of king John, bi&s;hop William pro|cured for it the privilege of a market and fair; and then the road, that before lay through Writtle, the antient Canonium, began to pa&s;s thro' this town. It is pretty large, and &s;tands almo&s;t in the middle of the county, on which account it is the

<P>Saffron-Walden has the epithet of Saffron, from the great quantities of &s;affron rai&s;ed in its neigh|bourhood.

The roots being taken up about July, and replanted, in about three weeks there appears a blui&s;h flower, within which are three yellow chives, which are picked out and dried by a gentle fire. The pro|duce of an acre, when dried, is about twenty pounds. It is a hand&s;ome town, and by virtue of a charter from Edward VI. is governed by a mayor and twenty-four aldermen, out of whom is yearly cho&s;en a trea&s;urer, who is the chief officer for that year, and two chanberlains his a&s;&s;i&s;tants.</P>

In a grotto &s;everal Roman antiquities have been found, particularly an urn, in&s;cribed Coccilli M. i. e. Manibus to Coccillus's gho&s;t; and from him, perhaps, the town had its name.</P>
<P>Bocking. The deanry of this town, as it is called, is worth &s;ix or &s;even hundred pounds a|year, and in the gift of the archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury. There is a &s;pecies of bays peculiar to this place, called Bockings, which render it a very flouri&s;hing place.</P>

<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES and CURIOSITIES.</HEAD>
<P>Hornchurch. Here was formerly a mona&s;tery, called the Horned Mona&s;tery, from a pair of huge leaden horns fa&s;tened to it.</P>
<P>Barking. In this town was antiently a mona&s;tery of Benedictines, the olde&s;t and riche&s;t in England; and here William the Conqueror re&s;ided for &s;ome time after his coronation. It is chiefly inhabited by fi&s;hermen, who &s;end their fi&s;h in boats to Bil|ling&s;gate.</P>
<P>There are two pari&s;hes in this county of the name of Tilbury, oppo&s;ite to Grave&s;end, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the epithets of ea&s;t and we&s;t. In the former are &s;ome &s;pacious caverns in a chalky cliff, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been dug by the antient Britons, either for chalk to manure the ground, or for granaries to &s;ecure their corn again&s;t their ene|mies and the weather. In the latter is Tilbury-fort, which commands the river, and has a con&s;tant gar|ri&s;on. It is encompa&s;&s;ed by a double ditch, of which the innermo&s;t is one hundred and eighty feet wide, and towards the river, be&s;ides the guns on the curtain and ba&s;tions, there is a platform mounting above one hundred guns. Towards the land are two redoubts, and in ca&s;e of the approach of an enemy, they can lay the level under water.</P>
<P>Witham, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the old An&s;am in Antoninus's Itinerary, is a neat town, and a great thoroughfare.</P>
<P>Waltham. Here in antient times was a famous mona&s;tery built by Harold, the &s;on of earl God|win, in honour of the holy cro&s;s, in which he made his &s;olemn vows for &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t the Nor|mans, and in which, after his death, he was in|terred. In the gardens of the abbey is a fine tulip tree, much vi&s;ited by the curious.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of this town, is a royal

<P>At A&s;&s;ington, near Bellerica, was fought a de&s;|perate battle between Edmund Iron&s;ide and the Danes, in which the former was defeated.</P>
<P>At Bartlow, on the confines of Cambridge&s;hire, are four great barrows.</P>
<P>At Che&s;terford, near Walden, the ruins of a Roman town have been di&s;covered.</P>
<P>At Rochford, which gives title of earl to Wil|liam Henry Zule&s;tein de Na&s;&s;au, the lord of the honour of Raleigh, is held a court at cock-crow|ing, called lawle&s;s-court, on the Wedne&s;day after Michaelmas. The &s;teward and &s;uitors whi&s;per each other; they are not allowed either fire or candle; a piece of coal &s;erves in&s;tead of pen and ink; and whoever owes &s;ervice to the court, and does not attend, forfeits double his rent for every hour. Cambden tells us, this penance was im|po&s;ed on the tenants for having met at &s;uch an hour, to con&s;pire again&s;t their lord.</P>
<P>At Sterbury-Hill, a mile we&s;t from Walden, many Roman antiquities have been found. In Hartlow hundred, near Hallingbury, is an old military vallum called Walberg.</P>
<P>In the Thames, and &s;ea along the E&s;&s;ex coa&s;t, are &s;everal i&s;lands, as Mer&s;ey, between Maldon and Colche&s;ter waters; O&s;ey, or O&s;yth, below Maldon, which at certain &s;ea&s;ons is covered with wild|fowl; Canvey-i&s;le, in the Thames, by which it is &s;ometimes overflowed, called by Ptolemy Connos, and by other more ancient writers Convennos. Over-again&s;t it is a place called the Hope. In the mouth of the river, and along the E&s;&s;ex coa&s;t, are very dangerous flats and &s;ands, often fatal to mariners.

<HEAD>BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>This county has its name from Somerton, for|merly its chief town, and is bounded on the we&s;t by Devon&s;hire, on the &s;outh by Dor&s;et&s;hire, on the north by Bri&s;tol channel, or the Severn &s;ea, on the north-ea&s;t by a &s;mall part of Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, and on the ea&s;t by Wilt&s;hire. It is one of the large&s;t counties in England, extending in length from ea&s;t to we&s;t about &s;ixty miles; in breadth, where broade&s;t, from &s;outh to north, about fifty; and one hundred and fifty in circumference. It is divided into forty-two hundreds, in which are three cities, thirty market towns, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred villages, three hundred and eighty|five pari&s;hes, of which one hundred and thirty|two are vicarages, containing more than a million of acres, and about two hundred and eighty thou&s;and &s;ouls. It &s;ends eighteen members to parliament, viz. two for the county, two for Bri&s;tol, two for Bath, two for Wells, two for Taunton, two for Bridgewater, two for Ilche&s;ter, two for Milbourn|port, and two for Minehead.</P>

<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The air of this county is very mild and whole|&s;ome, e&s;pecially that of the hilly part. The &s;oil in general is exceeding rich, &s;o that &s;ingle acres very commonly produce forty or fifty bu&s;hels of wheat, and there have been in&s;tances of &s;ome pro|ducing &s;ixty of barley. As there is very fine pa|&s;ture both for &s;heep and black cattle, it abounds in both, which are as large as, and their fle&s;h of a finer grain, than tho&s;e of Lincoln&s;hire. In con|&s;equence of this abundance of black cattle, great quantities of chee&s;e are made in it, of which that of Cheddar is thought equal to Parme&s;an. In the hilly parts are found coal, lead, copper, lapis calaminaris, and okre. Wood thrives in it as well as in any county of the kingdom. It a|bounds al&s;o in pea&s;e, beans, beer, cyder, fruit, wild fowl, and &s;almon, and its mineral waters are celebrated all over the world.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>TRADE and MANUFACTURES.</HEAD>
<P>The riches of this county, both natural and ac|quired, exceed tho&s;e of any other in the kingdom, Middle&s;ex and York&s;hire excepted. The woolen manufacture in all its branches is carried on to a very great extent; and in &s;ome parts of the county great quantities of linen are made. If to the&s;e, the produce of various other commodities in which it abounds, is added, the amount of the whole mu&s;t, undoubtedly, be very great. Its foreign trade mu&s;t al&s;o be allowed to be very ex|ten&s;ive, when it is con&s;idered that it has a large trade for &s;ea-coal, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, be&s;ides other ports, that of Bri&s;tol, a town of the greate&s;t trade in Eng|land, next to London.</P>

<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Bri&s;tol, the capital, for trade, wealth, and num|ber of inhabitants, is inferior to none but Lon|don. Bri&s;tol is a corruption of Bright&s;tow, as it was called by the Saxons. It is thought to have &s;tood antiently altogether upon the we&s;t, or So|mer&s;et&s;hire, &s;ide of the Avon, before the bridge was built; but after that, it came to be partly in Somer&s;et&s;hire, and partly in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, until it was made a county of it&s;elf, though even before that, in the parliament rolls, it was always placed in Somer&s;et&s;hire. At pre&s;ent the ea&s;t &s;ide is by much the large&s;t and mo&s;t populous. It had antiently a ca&s;tle, built by-Robert, earl of Glou|ce&s;ter, natural &s;on to Henry I. which was demo|li&s;hed by Cromwell; and the ground is now laid out into &s;treets. The corporation con&s;i&s;ts of a mayor, recorder, twelve aldermen, of whom the recorder is one, two &s;heriffs, and twenty-eight common-council men. The recorder is generally a &s;erjeant at law, and &s;its as judge in capital and all other criminal cau&s;es. The mayor, to &s;upport his dignity, and defray his extraordinary expence, is entitled to certain fees from &s;hips, which up|wards of forty years ago amounted to five or &s;ix hundred pounds. Be&s;ides the cathedral, which was antiently the church of the Augu&s;tine mona&s;tery, there are eighteen pari&s;h churches. Here
<PB N="112" REF="1140">
are di&s;&s;enters of all denominations, of whom the quakers are very re&s;pectable, both for their wealth and numbers. When Henry VIII. di&s;&s;olved the mona&s;tery, he applied its revenues to the mainte|nance of a bi&s;hop, dean, &s;ix prebendaries, and other officers. Of the pari&s;h churches, St. Mary Ratcliff is reckoned one of the fine&s;t, not only here, but in the whole kingdom. In this church, be&s;ides two monuments of the founder, William Can|nings, who had been five times mayor of this city, one in the habit of a magi&s;trate, and another in that of a prie&s;t (for in his latter days he took or|ders) there is one of Sir William Pen, father to the famous quaker. The old bridge over the Avon con&s;i&s;ted of four broad arches with hou&s;es on both &s;ides, like tho&s;e formerly on London-bridge; but this has been lately pulled down, and another is erecting in its place. No carts or waggons are admitted into Bri&s;tol, for fear of damaging the vaults and gutters made under-ground, for carrying the filth of the city into the river. Queen's-&s;quare, in this city, is larger than any in London, except Lincolns-inn-fields, and has in the centre an eque&s;trian &s;tatue of king William III. All the gates of the city remain intire, and a part of the walls; the re&s;t were razed in the reign of William Rufus. It is almo&s;t as broad as long, about &s;even miles in circumference, and contains about ninety-five thou&s;and inhabitants. Of the ho&s;pitals, the chief are, fir&s;t, that called Queen Elizabeth's, in which one hundred boys are taught reading, writing, arithmetic, and naviga|tion; &s;ix of whom, when they go out, have ten pounds, and the re&s;t eight pounds eight &s;hillings, to bind them apprentices: the ma&s;ter is allowed four hundred and fifty pounds a year for the maintenance of the boys. Second, Col&s;ton's ho&s;pital, in which one hundred boys are maintained for &s;even years, and taught and apprenticed, as in queen Elizabeth's.
<PB N="113" REF="1150">
Third, Another founded by the &s;ame gentleman in 1691, for twelve men and twelve women, with an allowance of three &s;hillings per week, and twen|ty-four &s;acks of coals in the year. This charity co&s;t the founder twenty-five thou&s;and pounds. Four, Another founded partly by Mr. Col&s;ton, and partly by the merchants, in which eighteen men on account of the merchants, and twelve men and women on account of Mr. Col&s;ton, are maintained. Five, An infirmary, which was opened in 1736, for the &s;ick, lame, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed poor of this city, which is maintained by &s;ub&s;crip|tion, be&s;ides five thou&s;and pounds bequeathed to it by John Eldridge, e&s;&abque; formerly comptroller of the cu&s;toms at this port. There are, be&s;ides the&s;e, a bridewell, &s;everal alms-hou&s;es, and charity-&s;chools. There is al&s;o a guildhall for the &s;e&s;&s;ions and a&s;&s;izes; the mayor's and &s;heriffs courts; a council-hou&s;e, where the mayor and aldermen meet every day, except Sundays, to admini&s;ter ju&s;tice; a hand&s;ome new exchange, with three entrances, about two|thirds as large as that in London; and a key half a mile in length, the mo&s;t commodious in England for &s;hipping and landing goods, for which pur|po&s;e it is provided with &s;everal cranes. In col|lege-green is a &s;tately high cro&s;s, with the effigies of &s;everal kings round it. In Winch-&s;treet is a guard-hou&s;e, with barracks for &s;oldiers. As to the trade of this city, it was computed many years ago to be much greater, in proportion, e&s;pecially to America and the We&s;t Indies, than that of London. Fifty &s;ail, &s;ome of them &s;hips of con&s;i|derable burden, have arrived here at one time, or very near one another, from the We&s;t Indies. For this trade, and that to Ireland, it is much better &s;ituated than London, be&s;ides the great advan|tages it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es of an inland navigation by the Wye and Severn. Their trade is not confined
<PB N="114" REF="1160">
to the We&s;t Indies and America, but extends to the Baltic, Norway, Holland, Hamburgh, Guinea, and the Streights. The large&s;t &s;hips are di&s;charged at Hungroad, four miles below the city, and the goods brought to the key by lighters. For build|ing, equipping, and repairing &s;hips, there are docks, yards, rope-walks, and &s;hipwrights. Here are &s;ome con&s;iderable woollen manufactures, and no le&s;s than fifteen gla&s;s-hou&s;es, for which King&s;wood and Mendip furni&s;h the coals. The city compa|nies are thirteen: 1&s;t, The merchant adventurers. 2d, The merchant taylors. 3d, The mercers. 4th, The &s;oap-boilers. 5th, The tobacconi&s;ts. 6th, The butchers. 7th, The barbers. 8th, the tylers 9th, The holliers, who are the &s;led|men. 10th, Shoemakers. 11th, Coopers. 12th, Bakers. 13th, Smiths. For &s;upplying the city with water there are &s;ix public conduits; and hand|&s;ome hackney coaches may be hired at very rea|&s;onable rates, but they do not ply in the &s;treets. There are al&s;o &s;tage coaches, which &s;et out every day for Bath, London, and other places. A mile below the city, clo&s;e by the river, is the hot well, who&s;e waters are &s;pecific for the diabetes, and good in pthi&s;ical, &s;corbutic, and inflamma|tory di&s;orders. Hither is a great re&s;ort in the &s;ummer of invalids, as well as other company, for who&s;e accommodation and entertainment there is a pump-room, ball-room, coffee-hou&s;e, with ta|verns, and a great number of elegant lodging|hou&s;es, both below on a level with the well, and above, in the delightful village of Clifton, which is &s;ituated on the brow of a hill, from whence there are downs extending &s;everal miles, where the company ride out for exerci&s;e. Nothing can be more pure and &s;alutary than the air of the&s;e downs, which afford a variety of the mo&s;t roman|tic and agreeable pro&s;pects, comprehending King|road,

with the &s;hips at anchor, the mouth of the Severn, and the mountains of Wales. In the rocks above the well are found tho&s;e &s;ix cornered &s;tones, called Bri&s;tol &s;tones; but they are not &s;o plentiful now as in Cambden's days, when, he &s;ays, whole bu&s;hels might have been ea&s;ily ga|thered. In this city is a theatre, where plays are acted almo&s;t every night during the rece&s;s of the comedians from the metropolis. There are two annual fairs, to which the concour&s;e is &s;o great, that the neighbouring inns have filled one hundred beds a-piece with their gue&s;ts. In the winter &s;ea|&s;on there is an a&s;&s;embly every Thur&s;day for the gayer part of the citizens of both &s;exes. About half way betwixt Bri&s;tol and Bath, at a place called Warmly, a company of Bri&s;tol merchants have erected a noble manufacture of pins, and other bra&s;s uten&s;ils, which employs a great number of hands, including above two hundred children of both &s;exes from &s;even to twelve or thirteen years of age. All the different operations of melting, &s;plitting, drawing, hammering, turning, &amp;c. are performed by wheels worked with water, which is rai&s;ed by two fire-engines of a very curious me|chani&s;m. The contriver and manager of this great work is one Mr. Champion, a quaker of Bri&s;tol, who has an elegant hou&s;e and gardens on the &s;pot. The city of Bri&s;tol gives the title of earl to the family of Hervey. It is worth ob&s;erving, that whoever marries a citizen's daughter becomes free of the city.</P>
<P>Bath. All the different names that this city has borne in different ages and languages, have been taken from its medicinal waters, as the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or hot waters of Ptolomy: the aquae &s;olis, or waters of the &s;un, of Antoninus: the Caer Baden, and Caer Ennant, i. e. the city of Baths, and the city of Ointment, of the Britons:
<PB N="116" REF="1190">
and the Ackmanche&s;ter, i. e. the city of Valetudi|narians, of the Saxons. The baths con&s;i&s;t of the King's-bath, the Queen's-bath, the Cro&s;s-bath, the Hot-bath, the Leper's-bath, and the duke of King&s;ton's-bath. This place was of old a re&s;ort only for cripples and di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;ons; but now it is more frequented by the &s;ound for plea&s;ure, than the &s;ick for health. The waters are very plea&s;ant to the ta&s;te, and impregnated with a vitriolic prin|ciple, yielding upon evaporation, a little neutral &s;alt, and a calcarious earth and iron. They are very efficacious in &s;trengthening the bowels and &s;tomach, bracing the relaxed fibres, and invigo|rating the circulation. In bilious complaints they are counted &s;pecific, and prove &s;erviceable in mo&s;t nervous, paralytic, rheumatic, and gouty com|plaints. At the King's-bath is a hand&s;ome pump|room, where the gentlemen and ladies go in a morning to drink the waters; and there is a band of mu&s;ic that plays all the time. In the Cro&s;s bath is a monument of marble, repre&s;enting the de&s;cent of the Holy-Gho&s;t attended by angels, erected by the earl of Melfort (who was &s;ecretary of &s;tate for Scotland) when king James II. met his queen here. The King's-bath is a large ba&s;on of &s;ixty-five feet ten inches, by forty feet ten inches, containing three hundred and forty-&s;ix tuns, two hog&s;heads, and thirty-&s;ix gallons of water, when filled to its u&s;ual height. In the middle is a wooden building with niches and &s;eats for the accommodation of the bathers. There are al&s;o iron rings all round for them to hold by, and guides, both male and fe|male, to attend them in the bath. The per&s;on intending to bathe puts on, at his own lodgings, a bathing dre&s;s of brown canvas hired for the pur|po&s;e, and is carried in a clo&s;e chair, of a particular make, to one of the &s;lips which open into the bath. There he de&s;cends by &s;teps into the water, where
<PB N="117" REF="1200">
he is attended by a guide. Having &s;tayed his &s;tated time in the bath, he a&s;cends again into the &s;lip, where he puts off his bathing-dre&s;s, and being wrapt up in blankets, is carried home to bed, where he lies for &s;ome time to encourage per&s;pi|ration. The King's-bath is overlooked by the company in the pump-room; and adjoining to it are places furni&s;hed with pumps to pour the hot &s;treams on any particular part of the body. The Queen's-bath communicates with the King's, from which it is filled; therefore the water of it is not &s;o hot, being at a greater di&s;tance from the &s;ource. As the heat is here more moderate, the bathers de&s;cend fir&s;t into the Queen's-bath, and advance gradually to the centre of the other. In the year 1755, the abbey-hou&s;e, or priory, belong|ing to the duke of King&s;ton, was taken down, in order to erect a more commodious pile of building, and in digging for the foundation, the work men di&s;covered about twenty-feet below the &s;urface of the earth, the remains of Roman baths and &s;uda|tories con&s;tructed upon an elegant plan, with floors &s;u&s;pended on pillars, and &s;urrounded with tubu|lated bricks, for the conveyance of heat and va|pour. The&s;e were &s;upplied by a &s;pring of hot water, of the &s;ame properties and temperature with tho&s;e of the King's-bath; and the &s;ewer was found &s;till entire, that conveyed the wa&s;te water into the river. The duke, having cleared the &s;pring and the &s;ewer, has erected &s;everal convenient baths and &s;udatories on the &s;pot, where invalids may be ac|commodated at all hours, by night as well as by day. The two &s;ea&s;ons are the &s;pring and fall; but tho&s;e who take the waters purely for their health, do not regard the &s;ea&s;ons, but drink them all the year round. There are a number of genteel &s;edan chairs, which carry people to any di&s;tance, not exceeding half a mile, for &s;ixpence. The
<PB N="118" REF="1210">
company a&s;&s;emble in the afternoon, alternately, at two &s;tately rooms, to conver&s;e together, or play at cards. At a very pretty new theatre near the parades, plays are acted every other night; and there are balls twice a week, for which and the rooms, and books at the libraries, the gentry generally &s;ub&s;cribe. The city is &s;urrounded with hills on all &s;ides, except a little opening to the ea&s;t and we&s;t, thro' which the Avon runs. This river, which has been made navigable to Bri&s;tol by act of parliament, wa&s;hes the city on the ea&s;t and &s;outh &s;ides, and there is an elegant bridge over it. This city hath formerly had a &s;light wall, of which &s;ome part &s;till remains, as well as one or two of its gates; but almo&s;t all the new buildings, and much the greate&s;t and fine&s;t part of the city, is without the walls, particularly the fine &s;quare called Queen's|&s;quare, in the middle of which is a &s;mall garden, with gravel walks, and an obeli&s;k in the centre: but the greate&s;t ornament in Bath is the circus. It is of a circular form, con&s;i&s;ting of hou&s;es built on an uniform plan, with three openings at equal di&s;tances to the &s;outh, ea&s;t, and we&s;t, leading into as many &s;treets. The fronts of the hou&s;es, which are all three &s;tories high, are adorned with three rows of columns in pairs, of the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders, the frize embelli&s;hed with &s;culpture. The whole has an air of magnificence, which cannot fail to &s;trike the mo&s;t indifferent &s;pectator. In the centre of the area is a re&s;ervoir, or ba&s;on, filled by two or three &s;prings ri&s;ing in the neighbouring hills; whence the &s;treets in this di&s;trict are &s;upplied with water. On the &s;outh|&s;ide of the town, are the north and &s;outh parades, two noble walks, paved with hewn &s;tone, rai&s;ed upon arches, facing each an elegant row of hou&s;es on one &s;ide, and having a &s;tone balu&s;trade on the other. The&s;e, with the two &s;treets that join them,
<PB N="119" REF="1220">
were planned and executed by one Mr. Wood, an able architect, who likewi&s;e built the &s;quare, and projected the circus. The two public rooms &s;tand betwixt the north parade and Orange-grove; which la&s;t is a &s;quare planted with trees, having in the middle a &s;tone obeli&s;k, in&s;cribed in Latin to the late prince of Orange, who recovered his health in con&s;equence of drinking the Bath waters, and gave his name to this part of the town. Several new &s;treets and rows have of late years been built on the north &s;ide of Bath, in the neighbourhood of the &s;quare, &s;uch as Gay-&s;treet, Mil&s;om-&s;treet, Edgar-row, Harlequin-row, Bla|dud's-buildings, King's-mead-&s;treet, and Brock|&s;treet. A cemicircular range of buildings is ju&s;t begun near the Circus, to be called from its form the Cre&s;cent. Behind the Circus al&s;o is a fine riding-&s;chool ju&s;t fini&s;hed. In a word, new hou&s;es ap|pear in every corner, and Bath is continually ex|tending it&s;elf through all its different avenues. If this rage for building continues; and people per|&s;i&s;t in flocking thither from all quarters, Bath will &s;oon become one of the large&s;t and mo&s;t populous cities in England. Their advantages for building here are very great, having excellent free-&s;tone, lime&s;tone, and &s;late in the neighbourhood. One &s;ort of their lime is as white as &s;now. The guild|hall of Bath &s;tands in the market place, and is &s;aid to be built on a plan of Inigo Jones, which, how|ever, exhibits nothing worthy of that great archi|tect: be&s;ides, one end of it has been rebuilt in a different &s;tile. The hall is ornamented with &s;ome portraits of the late prince of Wales and other re|markable per&s;onages: but the greate&s;t curio&s;ity of the place is a Minerva's-head in bronze, a real antique, dug up in Stall-&s;treet, in the year 1725. Bath boa&s;ts a noble infirmary, or general ho&s;pital, for the reception of the &s;ick and lame from all
<PB N="120" REF="1230">
parts of the three kingdoms. It extends one hun|dred feet in front, and ninety in depth, being capa|ble of receiving one hundred and fifty patients. Here was antiently a mona&s;tery, of which the pre|&s;ent cathedral was the church. It is a venerable pile; the principal front of which is adorned with angels a&s;cending and de&s;cending. The bi&s;hop of the dioce&s;e is nominated both from Bath and Wells; yet he and his chapter always re&s;ide at Wells. There are three other churches in Bath, and &s;everal chapels and meeting-hou&s;es. Be&s;ides the infirmary, there are &s;everal other ho&s;|pitals, alms-hou&s;es, and charity-&s;chools. The corporation con&s;i&s;ts of a mayor, eight aldermen, of whom two are ju&s;tices of the peace, and twenty-four common-council men. The city is extremely well provided with &s;tage-coaches, po&s;t-coaches, chai&s;es, machines, and waggons. Bath is the general ho&s;pital of the nation, and a great num|ber of invalids find benefit from the waters: but as the city lies in a bottom &s;urrounded by very high hills, the air is con&s;tantly &s;urcharged with damps, and indeed this place is more &s;ubject to rain than any other part in England. The mar|kets are remarkably well &s;upplied with provi&s;ions of all kinds at rea&s;onable rates, particularly fi&s;h and poultry. They al&s;o afford excellent mutton fed upon Lan&s;down, one of the highe&s;t hills that over|look the city. This down, remarkable for its pure air, extends about three miles, and at the ex|tremity of it, there is a &s;tone monument, with an in&s;cription, erected to the memory of Sir Bevil Granville, who was here killed in a battle which he fought with the parliament's army, in the reign of Charles I. On the downs to the &s;outh, about a mile from Bath, is a very fine &s;eat, called Prior|park, which was built by the late Mr. Allen, a gentleman &s;o eminent both for his virtues and abi|lities,
<PB N="121" REF="1240">
that his memory will be ever dear to this place. St. James's pari&s;h gave birth to Mr. Hales, a man greatly celebrated for his learning, tem|perance, probity, and piety, who&s;e chamber, Dr. Heylin &s;ays, was a church, and his chair a pulpit. At Swain&s;wic, in this neighbourhood, was born the famous William Prynne, who repre&s;ented this city in parliament from the re&s;toration to the death of Charles II. and wrote one hundred and &s;eventy-two folios, quartos, octavos, and duodecimos. A|bout a mile to the &s;outh of the city is a chalybeate mineral water, called Lyncombe-Spaw. The hou&s;e at the Spaw is u&s;ed at pre&s;ent for inoculation. A little way from the north-parade, on the other &s;ide the river, is a public garden much frequented in &s;ummer. The fle&s;h and green markets are now removed from the &s;treet, and particular places al|lotted for them. The foundations al&s;o of a new guildhall have been laid, a fine chapel, called the Octogon chapel, has been lately built in Mil&s;om|&s;treet, and a methodi&s;t-chapel, in Harlequin-row, called Lady Huntingdon's.</P>
<P>Wells is a neat little city, with broad &s;treets, containing about four thou&s;and inhabitants. It has its name from the wells that &s;pring up in all parts of it. It was erected into a bi&s;hop's &s;ee, anno 905, and the cathedral was repaired, or ra|ther rebuilt, upwards of five hundred years ago, by bi&s;hop Fitz-Joceline. Its front is much ad|mired for its imagery and carved &s;tone-work. The bi&s;hop's palace is one of the hand&s;ome&s;t in the kingdom, and has a fine chapel built by the abovementioned Fitz-Joceline. By an act pa&s;&s;ed in the thirty-fifth of king Henry VIII. it was ordained, that the dean and chapter of Wells &s;hould make one &s;ole chapter for the bi&s;hop. Be|&s;ides the bi&s;hop and dean, to this church belong twenty-&s;even prebendaries, nineteen petty canons,
<PB N="122" REF="1250">
a precentor, a trea&s;urer, a chancellor, and three archdeacons, viz. of Bath, Wells, and Taunton. Here are &s;everal ho&s;pitals founded by their bi&s;hops, a charity-&s;chool, and four alms-hou&s;es. A manu|facture of bone-lace is carried on at Wells; but the poor are chiefly employed in knitting ho&s;e. The town is governed by a mayor, &s;even ma&s;ters or aldermen, &s;ixteen gown&s;men, or common-coun|cil men. In the great &s;torm that happened in the night in 1703, bi&s;hop Kidder and his lady were killed in their beds at this place, by the fall of a &s;tack of chimnies.</P>
<P>Bridgewater is a corruption of Brugge-walter, or Walter's-borough, it having been given to one Walter a Norman after the conque&s;t. Here was antiently a &s;trong ca&s;tle, and priory of friars|minors. It &s;tands on the Bri&s;tol-channel at the mouth of the Parret, over which it has a bridge, and which is navigable from hence to Taunton, and abounds with fi&s;h, e&s;pecially &s;almon. The town is a corporation with great privileges, as freedom from inque&s;ts out of the town, power to make bye-laws and free burge&s;&s;es, to purcha&s;e lands, to have a court of record within the bo|rough, an admiralty court, and pye-powder court, during their fairs and markets, of which it has &s;everal very con&s;iderable for corn, cattle, hogs, &s;heep, chee&s;e, &amp;c. King Charles I. extended the juri&s;diction and privileges of the corporation to the whole pari&s;h of Bridgewater. The &s;tile of the corporation is a mayor, aldermen, and burge&s;&s;es. The town &s;uffered greatly in the civil wars, and by the duke of Monmouth's ill-concerted enter|prize; but after the revolution the trade of this town increa&s;ed con&s;iderably, and the key &s;o much enlarged, that &s;hips of two hundred tons may now come up to it. The tide runs &s;trong ten miles above the town, and at &s;pring comes in roaring and &s;oaming
<PB N="123" REF="1260">
very furiou&s;ly, whence it is called the boar. Such tides ri&s;e twenty-two feet at the key. An e&s;timate may be made of its trade by the receipt of the cu&s;toms, which amount to upwards of three thou|&s;and pounds a year, clear of &s;alaries and incidental charges. Be&s;ides its coa&s;ting trade to Bri&s;tol, Wales, and Cornwall, it has a con&s;iderable foreign trade to Ireland, Portugal, Newfoundland, and &s;ometimes to the Streights, Virginia, and the We&s;t Indies. The town has a revenue of ten thou&s;and pounds; its freemen are free in all the ports of England, except London, and of Ireland, except Dublin; and its bailiffs have the authority of &s;heriffs within the borough, which was made a county of it&s;elf by Henry VIII. It contains about four thou&s;and &s;ouls, has &s;ome good inns, a &s;paci|ous town-hall, church, and free-&s;chool, a private academy for &s;uch of their youth as are intended for preachers, and a fine meeting-hou&s;e, with this peculiarity, that it has an advanced &s;eat for the mayor and aldermen, who happen to be di&s;&s;enters. The famous admiral Blake was a native of this town, as was al&s;o John Oldmixon, e&s;quire, who wrote that admiral's life, together with the hi&s;tory of the Stuarts. Four miles below Bridgewater is the lord&s;hip of Powlet, which gave name to the dukes of Bolton and earls Powlet.</P>
<P>Minehead &s;tands on the Bri&s;tol channel, has a &s;afe harbour, and is much frequented by pa&s;&s;engers to and from Ireland. It is divided into the upper and lower, middle and key towns, containing about two thou&s;and &s;ouls. It is well built and the har|bour is capable of receiving &s;hips of the greate&s;t burden. Its chief trade is with Ireland and South Wales, for both which it is very conveniently &s;itu|ated, importing great quantities of wool from the former, and of coals from the latter; it has al&s;o a corre&s;pondence with the merchants of Bri&s;tol and
<PB N="124" REF="1270">
Barn&s;taple, &s;ends &s;hips &s;ometimes to Virginia and the We&s;t-Indies, and &s;everal thou&s;and barrels of herrings to the Mediterranean every year. It was made a corporation, and had large privileges grant|ed to it by queen Elizabeth, on condition of keep|ing the key in repair; but that having been ne|glected, it has lo&s;t them, and is now governed by two con&s;tables, cho&s;en at the court-leet of the Lut|terels, who are lords of the manor, and who have made a fine key and piers, in con&s;equence of an act of parliament, by which they were entitled to the profits of certain duties for a number of years.</P>
<P>Taunton, or Thonton, is a large populous town, the number of its inhabitants amounting to twenty-thou&s;and. It is &s;ituated on the Thone, which was made navigable to Bridgewater by an act of parliament in the reign of William III. and has here a bridge over it of &s;ix arches. The &s;treets are &s;pacious and clean, but the &s;mell of the oil u&s;ed about the wool is offen&s;ive to &s;trangers; for here is a great woollen manufacture, which employs &s;everal thou&s;and of the inhabitants. In this town is an academy to train up di&s;&s;enters for the mini&s;try, two churches, &s;everal alms-hou&s;es, and a well en|dowed free-&s;chool. Di&s;&s;enters of all denomina|tions have meeting-hou&s;es in this place. The a&s;&s;izes for the county are generally held in the hall of a ca&s;tle built by one of the bi&s;hops of Winche&s;ter, to whom the town belonged before the conque&s;t. There was once another ca&s;tle built by Ina, king of the We&s;t Saxons. The corporation con&s;i&s;ts of a mayor, recorder, ju&s;tice, two aldermen, twenty-four capital burge&s;&s;es, a town-clerk, two con&s;ta|bles, two portreves, and two &s;erjeants at mace. The community has no lands or hou&s;es, or &s;tock of money, and the mayor very trifling privileges, in compari&s;on of tho&s;e of other towns: therefore, tho' the town is the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing, the corpo|ration
<PB N="125" REF="1280">
is the poore&s;t in the county. The inhabi|tants of Taunton were among the fir&s;t that joined the prince of Orange at his landing, and are &s;till counted among the mo&s;t zealous whigs of Eng|land. Every pot-walloner in this town, that is all who dre&s;s their own victuals, have a vote for members of parliament; for which rea&s;on the lodgers, a little before the election comes on, take care to boil their victuals in the &s;treet, that they may be intitled to vote. In the vale of Taunton, vul|garly called Taunton-Dean, the lands are &s;aid to be &s;o exceeding rich, as to need no manure; but the inhabitants are very boori&s;h. The bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter has great intere&s;t in Taunton, his quit|rents and fines amounting to about one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred pounds a-year. All the lands are re|gi&s;tered, and tho' &s;ubject to fines, quit-rents, &s;uit and &s;ervice, commonly &s;ell at twenty years purcha&s;e. Near this place is the i&s;le of Athelney, formed by the conflux of the Parret and Thone, where king Alfred, with a few of his nobles, concealed them|&s;elves, when the Danes had over-run the whole country to the fore&s;t of Selwood. Here he was en|tertained by a poor &s;wine-herd, whom he after|wards made bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter.</P>
<P>Ilche&s;ter, or Ivelche&s;ter, had its name from its &s;ituation on the river Ivel. It is very antient, being the I&s;chalis of Antoninus, where Roman coins are often found. It appears to have been much larger formerly than it is now, and to have had a ca&s;tle and double walls. Here is the county gaol, and the county courts are held at this place. The knights of the &s;hire are al&s;o cho&s;en at this town. It is governed by two bailiffs and twelve burge&s;&s;es, who are lords of the manor; and it gives title of earl to Stephen Fox, brother to lord Hol|land. This was the birth-place of the famous friar Bacon, who lived in the reign of Henry III. and was &s;o learned, that he pa&s;&s;ed for a conjurer
<PB N="126" REF="1290">
in that dark illiterate age. As &s;uch he was taken up by order of pope Nicholas IV. and kept clo&s;e pri&s;oner many years.</P>
<P>Milbourn-Port is &s;o antient a borough, that it is mentioned in Doom&s;day-book. It is governed by two &s;ub-bailiffs, under nine capital bailiffs: there are al&s;o two con&s;tables of great power, and two &s;tewards, cho&s;en out of &s;even others, who have the cu&s;tody of the common &s;eal of the borough, and the di&s;tribution of the rents of the lands given to the poor. The two bailiffs return the members of parliament, and the number of the inhabitants is about eleven hundred.</P>
<P>Next to the parliamentary towns, Gla&s;tenbury, on account of its antiquity, claims the fir&s;t place. The abbey, which gave ri&s;e to the town, &s;eems to have been the fir&s;t and olde&s;t foundation of that kind in Britain. The monks pretend that it was the re|&s;idence of Jo&s;eph of Arimathea and St. Patrick; but for this a&s;&s;ertion they produce no good autho|rity. The king of the We&s;t Saxons erected a church here, which he, and the &s;ucceeding kings, enriched to &s;uch a degree, that the abbot lived like a prince, had the title of lord, and &s;at among the barons in parliament, and no per&s;on, not even a bi&s;hop or prince, dur&s;t &s;et foot on the i&s;le of Avalon, in which the abbey &s;tands, without his leave. The revenue of the abbey was above forty thou&s;and pounds a-year, be&s;ides &s;even parks well &s;tocked with deer. The la&s;t abbot, Richard Whi|ting, who had a hundred monks, and three hun|dred dome&s;ticks, was hanged in his pontificals, with two of his monks, on the Torr, a high hill in the neighbourhood, for refu&s;ing to take the oath of &s;upremacy to Henry VIII. and &s;urrender his abbey when required. He was al&s;o charged with &s;eizing the church plate to &s;upport the rebellion in York&s;hire, and with having in his clo&s;et a manu|&s;cript

again&s;t the king's divorce. The &s;tory of the Gla&s;tenbury thorn, and of its budding always upon Chri&s;tmas-day is well known; however, that circum&s;tance is fal&s;e, tho', if the winter is mild, it always buds about the latter end of December, but later, if the winter is &s;evere. Edgar, and many other Saxon kings, were buried here, and, as &s;ome will have it, Arthur the Briti&s;h king. By the ve|nerable remains of this antient abbey and church, which are now mo&s;tly over-grown with ivy, they appear to have been very &s;pacious and magnificent. The town, who&s;e name &s;ome derive from Gla&s;tum, woad, which is &s;aid to grow hereabouts &s;pontane|ou&s;ly, was in the time of its abbots both a parlia|mentary borough and a corporation; but &s;ince that period it remained without the&s;e privileges, till Sir Peter King, afterwards lord chancellor, pro|cured a charter of incorporation for it from queen Anne. There is a manufacture of &s;tockings; but the chief dependence of the place is upon &s;trangers, who&s;e curio&s;ity brings them to &s;ee the ruins of the abbey. The &s;cite of the abbey now belongs to the duke of Devon&s;hire.</P>
<P>Wellington is chiefly noted for its fairs for cat|tle, and its manufacture of &s;erges, druggets, &amp;c. It was al&s;o the &s;eat of that upright judge, lord chief ju&s;tice Popham, who founded an ho&s;pital in it for &s;ix poor men and as many women.</P>
<P>Dulverton is a pretty town on the London road to Truro, in Cornwall. In its neighbourhood are mines of lead. It is governed by a portreve and recorder, who keep a court of record, and have power of arre&s;ts.</P>

Watchet is a &s;mall harbour, having a few ve&s;&s;els belonging to it. The pier was built by the late Sir William Wyndham, for which he was allowed the key duties, by act of parlia|ment. The inhabitants burn abundance of &s;ea|weed for the gla&s;s-hou&s;es at Bri&s;tol, and make lime, both for building and manuring their land, of pebbles fetched from the &s;ea coa&s;t. A great deal of alaba&s;ter is wa&s;hed down from the &s;ea-cliffs here, and conveyed to Bri&s;tol.</P>
<P>Yeovil is a large town, containing above two thou&s;and inhabitants, governed by a portreve and twelve burge&s;&s;es. Here is a manufacture of cloth and gloves, and one of the greate&s;t markets in the county for corn, chee&s;e, hemp, flax, linnen, and &s;ail cloth. At Camelet and Che&s;terton, in its neighbourhood, are the remains of a Roman camp; and many coins and other antiquities have been dug up there.</P>
<P>At Somerton, as we ob&s;erved before, from which the county derives its name, and once its capital, was antiently a &s;trong ca&s;tle, in which John, king of France, was &s;ome time confined. Near the town is a common of twenty thou&s;and acres, where mo&s;t of the cattle brought to its fairs and markets are fed.</P>
<P>Axbridge, a borough under Mendip-hills, up|on the river Axe, from which it derives its name, is a neat clean little town, and a corporation, con&s;i&s;ting of a mayor, aldermen, and burge&s;&s;es, who are lords paramount of the manor. The un|der-lords are called and &s;it as judges in the court|leet. Teazles, a kind of thi&s;tles u&s;ed in dre&s;&s;ing cloth, are more cultivated here than in any other place in England.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of Axbridge is the pa|ri&s;h of Chedder, which is noted for its fine large chee&s;es, &s;ome of which weigh one hundred or a
<PB N="129" REF="1320">
hundred and fifty pounds, and co&s;t &s;ixpence a pound on the &s;pot. The pari&s;h is twenty-three miles in compa&s;s; and abounds &s;o much with ap|ple-trees, that three thou&s;and hog&s;heads of cyder have been made in a &s;ea&s;on, and thirty-nine hor&s;e|loads of apples &s;ent every week to Shipton-Mallet for &s;ale, for twenty-nine weeks running. Above the town is a gap, between two hills or rocks, two or three hundred feet high, for a mile together, called Cheddar-cliffs. At the foot of the&s;e cliffs ri&s;es a &s;pring, which within a quarter of a mile of its &s;ource drives twelve mills.</P>
<P>Chard con&s;i&s;ts of four &s;treets, which terminate near the market-place. It has a good market for corn and butcher's meat, and a woollen manu|facture, but not very con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Keyn&s;ham, or Cane&s;ham, lies between Bath and Bri&s;tol, has a bridge of fifteen arches over the Avon, and a con&s;iderable trade in malt. Here was antiently a priory of black canons, and a royal deer-park. In its neighbourhood is a quarry, where &s;tones, called &s;nake's-&s;tones, are found, be|cau&s;e they have the re&s;emblance of a &s;erpent, ex|cept that they want the head, and are of all &s;izes. Betwixt this town and Bri&s;tol are mines of coal, like tho&s;e of Newca&s;tle. At Staunton Drew, not far from this place, is a monument called the Wedding, &s;omething like Stonhenge; and on the top of a hill a camp named Stantonbury.</P>
<P>Bruton. Here was antiently a priory, and now there is a hand&s;ome church, free-&s;chool, alms-hou&s;e, and a great manufacture of &s;erges and &s;tockings.</P>
<P>Ca&s;tle-Carey is a &s;mall town, and of note only for its mineral water, de&s;cribed by Dr. Guidot in his account of tho&s;e of Bath. Here was antiently a ca&s;tle, as its name imports.</P>
<P>Shepton-Mallet is a large town, but very irre|gular,
<PB N="130" REF="1330">
by being &s;ituated on &s;teep hills. It is go|verned by a con&s;table, and has &s;ome con&s;iderable clothiers in it.</P>
<P>Cro&s;comb is a pretty neat town on a river, in the road to Wells. Some cloth is made here; but the principal manufacture is that of &s;tockings.</P>
<P>Froome-Selwood is a very large town, a great thoroughfare, and the chief of that di&s;trict antient|ly called Selwood&s;hire, which was one continued fore&s;t in the ea&s;t part of this county, and the we&s;t of Wilt&s;hire Here, tho' the town is larger than &s;ome cities, is but one church, which is very hand|&s;ome, and has a good organ; but there are &s;ix or &s;even meeting-hou&s;es, &s;ome of them very large and neat, be&s;ides a free-&s;chool and an alms-hou&s;e. Tho' the inhabitants are reckoned to be about thirteen thou&s;and, it is no corporation, but is governed by two con&s;tables cho&s;en at the court-leet. The woollen manufacture, in this town and its neigh|bourhood, was formerly &s;o con&s;iderable, that &s;even waggons, containing each one hundred and forty pieces worth fourteen pounds, one piece with an|other, were &s;ent out weekly for Blackwell-hall. The&s;e manufactures &s;till flouri&s;h here, tho', perhaps, not in &s;uch an extraordinary manner as in times pa&s;t. This town is al&s;o noted for its fine beer; as a neigh|bouring &s;olitary village called Agford is for the re&s;idence of the late celebrated Mrs. Rowe. She was born at Ilche&s;ter; but here &s;he compo&s;ed mo&s;t of her pieces, both in pro&s;e and ver&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CURIOSITIES.</HEAD>
<P>Mendip-Hills extend a great way, are very &s;teep, and noted for lead and coals. Any Eng|li&s;hman may work in the lead mines, unle&s;s he has forfeited his right by &s;tealing any of the ore or tools. Whoever is found guilty of the&s;e, is &s;hut
<PB N="131" REF="1340">
up in a hut, &s;urrounded with fern, which is &s;et on fire. As his hands and feet are at liberty, he is allowed to open him&s;elf a way thro' the hut and flames, but mu&s;t never be &s;een there again. This is called burning the hill. The lead of the&s;e hills, not being &s;o &s;oft and pliant as that of Derby&s;hire, is not &s;o proper for &s;heeting, but is generally ex|ported, and ca&s;t into bullets and &s;mall &s;hot. Tho&s;e employed in melting the lead are &s;ubject to a di&s;ea&s;e in the bowels, which frequently proves fatal, and the &s;moke often kills the cattle that feed in the neighbourhood: nor can tho&s;e who live near the place where the lead ore is wa&s;hed, keep either cat or dog, or any &s;ort of fowl, for they all die in a &s;hort time, and even their children &s;ometimes expire &s;uddenly. The air near the mines is thick, cold, and foggy, and the &s;oil red and &s;tony. The trees have their tops bla&s;ted, their leaves and bark di&s;coloured and &s;corched, and they grow to no con&s;iderable &s;ize. Fro&s;t and &s;now melt quickly near the mines, tho' they remain longer upon other parts of the hills than any where el&s;e in the adjacent country. Thunder-&s;torms, nocturnal|lights, and fiery meteors, are more common here than el&s;ewhere. For a &s;upply of air, the miners have elm-boxes, exactly clo&s;ed, by which they carry it down above twenty fathom. Thirty-&s;ix hundred of the be&s;t ore will yield above a ton of lead, which when formed into what the miners call &s;ows and pigs, is conveyed to Bri&s;tol, and exported. In the pari&s;h of Workey, on the &s;outh-&s;ide of the hill, is a famous cave called Workey-hole. The water, that is continually dropping from the roof of it, and con&s;olidating into a gla&s;&s;y &s;ub&s;tance, pre&s;ents a great many chimerical figures, e&s;peci|ally to &s;trong imaginations. The darkne&s;s of the place, the height of the vault, the hollow mur|mur of the waters thro' the rocks, and the echo,
<PB N="132" REF="1350">
which is very &s;urpri&s;ing to tho&s;e who are unac|quainted with the nature of &s;ounds, render it very awful and tremendous. To the roof of it, at cer|tain places, hang multitudes of bats. Near the hills are &s;ome veins of magne&s;ia and yellow okre; and at Bi&s;hop's-Chew is dug up a red bolus, which is u&s;ed all over England for marking &s;heep, and by the apothecaries for bolus armenus. In Bi&s;hop's Chew, or Chew-magna pari&s;h, the hou&s;es, even of the poore&s;t people, are extremely neat, being generally whited over, and accommodated with neat gardens. On the top of the hill, in the &s;ame pari&s;h, from whence there is a very noble pro&s;pect, are the remains of a camp, trebly forti|fied, and of a circular form, for which rea&s;on it is called Bow-ditch.</P>

<HEAD>BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>This county is bounded on the we&s;t by So|mer&s;et&s;hire, on the ea&s;t by Berk&s;hire and Hamp|&s;hire, on the north by Gloce&s;ter&s;hire, and on the &s;outh by Dor&s;et&s;hire and part of Hamp&s;hire. The length amounts to thirty-nine miles, its breadth to thirty, and its circumference to one hundred and forty. It contains twenty-nine hun|dreds, twenty-three market towns, three hundred and four pari&s;hes, and about eight hundred and &s;eventy-&s;ix thou&s;and &s;ouls. Be&s;ides two members for the &s;hire, and two for the city of Sali&s;bury, each of the following towns &s;ends two to parliament, viz.

<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, PRODUCE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>The air of this county is very healthy, not only in the more low and level parts, but al&s;o on the hills. The &s;oil of the vales is very rich, and pro|duces corn and gra&s;s in great plenty. The beau|tiful downs in the &s;outh yield the fine&s;t pa&s;ture for &s;heep, with which they are over&s;pread. The greate&s;t di&s;advantage the county labours under is want of fuel, as there are no coal-pits, and but little wood. This county is noted for great quan|tities of very fine chee&s;e, and for its manufacture of broad cloth, to which it was invited by the great plenty and finene&s;s of its wool. Be&s;ides le&s;&s;er &s;treams not a few, it is watered by the rivers I&s;is, Kennet, Upper and Lower Avon, Willy,

<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Sali&s;bury, the capital, is large and well built. It owed its ri&s;e to its cathedral, which was begun in 1219, and fini&s;hed in 1258. According to an e&s;timate delivered in to Henry III. it co&s;t forty thou&s;and marks. It is a Gothic building, and is certainly the mo&s;t elegant and regular in the king|dom. The doors and chapels are equal in num|ber to the months, the windows to the days, and the pillars and pila&s;ters to the hours in a year. It is built in the form of a lantern, with a &s;pire in the middle, and nothing but buttre&s;&s;es, and gla&s;s windows on the out&s;ide. The &s;pire is the highe&s;t in the kingdom, being four hundred and ten feet, which is twice the height of the monument in Lon|don. The pillars and pila&s;ters in the church are of fu&s;ile marble, the art of which is now either intirely lo&s;t, or little known. The roof of the chapter-hou&s;e, which is fifty feet in diameter, and one hundred and fifty in circumference, bears all upon one &s;lender pillar, which is &s;uch a curio&s;ity as can hardly be matched in Europe. The turning of the we&s;tern road thro' the city in the reign of Ed|ward III. was a great advantage to it. The chan|cellor&s;hip of the mo&s;t noble order of the Garter, which is annexed to this &s;ee, was fir&s;t conferred on bi&s;hop Richard Beauchamp. The ho&s;pital of St. Michael's, near this city, was founded by one of its bi&s;hops. Dr. Seth Ward, bi&s;hop of this &s;ee, in the reign of Charles II. contributed great|ly to the making the river Avon navigable to Chri&s;t-church in Hamp&s;hire. The &s;ame prelate in 1683 built an ho&s;pital for the entertainment of the widows of poor mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel. There are three other churches be&s;ides the cathedral,
<PB N="136" REF="1400">
which is without the liberty of the city, and a greater number of boarding-&s;chools, e&s;pecially for young ladies, than in any other town in England. Here is a manufacture of druggets, flannels, bone|lace, and tho&s;e cloths called Sali&s;bury-whites; in con&s;ideration of which, and its fairs, markets, a&s;&s;izes, boarding-&s;chools, and clergy, the city may be ju&s;tly &s;aid to be in a flouri&s;hing condition. It was incorporated by Henry III. and is governed by a mayor, high-&s;teward, recorder, deputy-re|corder, twenty-four aldermen, and thirty a&s;&s;i&s;t|ants, or common-council men. The number of &s;ouls is about ten thou&s;and. That called the clo&s;e, where the canons and prebendaries live, is like a fine city of it&s;elf. Here is an a&s;&s;embly for the la|dies every Tue&s;day, and coaches &s;et out from hence to London every day. In the cathedral is the figure of one Bennet, who endeavoured to fa&s;t forty days and forty nights, in imitation of our Saviour, but fell a victim to his enthu&s;ia&s;tical folly. In this town are &s;everal charity-&s;chools; the expence of one them is entirely defrayed by the bi&s;hop. The city gives title of earl to the noble family of Cecil.</P>
<P>Old Sarum, though now only a farm-hou&s;e, was antiently a very con&s;iderable place. It was a Roman &s;tation, and in Antoninus's Itinerary, is called Sorbiodunum. Some of the latter Roman emperors are &s;aid to have re&s;ided here &s;ome time, particularly Severus. King Edgar, in 960, held a council here; but Swain, king of Denmark, plundered and burnt the town. In 1078, the bi|&s;hop's &s;ee was removed hither from Sherburn, and not long after the cathedral was built. Hither William the Conqueror &s;ummoned all the &s;tates of the kingdom to &s;wear allegiance to him; and his &s;on, Henry I. a&s;&s;embled in this town the lords &s;piritual and temporal. But not long after, it
<PB N="137" REF="1410">
began to be de&s;erted, and a new town was began in the vale below, which was better accommo|dated, both with re&s;pect to air and water, than the former. This, as well as three other poor vil|lages not far from Sali&s;bury, &s;end two members to parliament. The number of the electors are about ten, who have lands adjoining, and are &s;tyled burge&s;&s;es and freeholders.</P>
<P>Wilton was once the chief town of the county, to which it al&s;o gave name, though at pre&s;ent but a &s;mall place. It was very populous in the time of the Saxons, when it had a mona&s;tery and a great many churches. It was al&s;o &s;ome time the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, but it began afterwards to decline, e&s;pe|cially after the we&s;tern road was turned through Sali&s;bury. Its greate&s;t glory now is the magni|ficent &s;eat of the earl of Pembroke and Montgo|mery, built out of the &s;uppre&s;&s;ed abbeys, and called Wilton-hou&s;e. The hou&s;e was mo&s;tly de|&s;igned by Inigo Jones; and the gardens are &s;o no|ble, the furniture, the pictures, &s;culptures, the &s;tatues and bu&s;tos, both Greek and Roman, are &s;o exqui&s;itely fine and numerous, that it would require a volume to give any tolerable account of them.</P>
<P>Downton, plea&s;antly &s;ituated upon the Avon, is an antient borough by pre&s;cription, and its mayor is cho&s;en at the court leet of the lord of the manor.</P>
<P>Hindon, another &s;mall borough, governed by a bailiff and burge&s;&s;es, but a con&s;iderable tho|roughfare, has a market, chiefly for cattle, and a manufacture of fine twi&s;t.</P>
<P>Heyte&s;b ury is an antient borough, and &s;tands on the river Willy, has a collegiate church with four prebendaries, a free-&s;chool, and is govern|ed by a bailiff and burge&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>We&s;tbury, a &s;mall borough, deriving its name from its &s;ituation, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have ri&s;en out

of the ruins of the old Roman town about half a mile to the north, which &s;ome think was the Ver|lucio of Antoninus. It is governed by a mayor, recorder, and twelve aldermen, and has a manu|facture of coar&s;e broad cloth.</P>
<P>Calne is a &s;mall, but populous, well-built town. On the other &s;ide of the river, on which it &s;tands, near Studley, was antiently a Roman colony, from which this town is &s;uppo&s;ed to have ri&s;en, where Roman coins are often found. The We&s;t Saxon kings had a palace, and, it is probable, there was once a ca&s;tle, from a &s;treet and field &s;till called by that name. Here, in 997, was held a great &s;ynod to put an end to the di&s;putes between the monks and &s;ecular prie&s;ts about the celibacy of the clergy and the monks holding benefices; when, in the middle of the debates, the hou&s;e in which the &s;tates were a&s;&s;embled &s;uddenly fell to the ground, together with the bi&s;hops and no|bility of the kingdom. Many were killed by the fall, and others brui&s;ed; St. Dun&s;tan alone, who pre&s;ided in the &s;ynod, and favoured the monks, e&s;caped unhurt: in con&s;equence of which e&s;cape, that party triumphed. The manor, prebend, and par&s;onage of Calne, are held by lea&s;es for &s;everal lives from the dean, chapter, and trea&s;urer of Sa|rum.</P>
<P>Devizes is a large populous town, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of two &s;treets running parallel to one an|other. It is thought to have been a &s;tation of the Romans, from the many coins, urns, and other antiquities dug up, and from the &s;quare camp on Roundway-hill, that overhangs the town. It derives its name from Devitiacus, a Briti&s;h prince, who re&s;ided in this part of the country. Here was antiently one of the &s;tronge&s;t ca&s;tles in Eng|land, either improved or erected by Roger, bi&s;hop of Sarum, in the time of king Stephen. A dif|ference
<PB N="139" REF="1430">
afterwards ari&s;ing between the king and the bi&s;hop, the ca&s;tle was be&s;ieged, and when it was &s;urrendered by the bi&s;hop's nephew, forty thou&s;and marks of &s;ilver, be&s;ides plate, gold, and jewels, were found in it. In the late civil wars, after it had been be&s;ieged &s;everal times, it was taken by the parliament forces, and demoli&s;hed. The town has a great market for corn, wool, hor&s;es, and all &s;orts of cattle, and its malt-trade and woollen manufacture are very con&s;iderable; but it is but ill &s;upplied with water. The corpo|ration con&s;i&s;ts of a mayor, recorder, eleven ma&s;|ters, and thirty-&s;ix common-council.</P>
<P>Chippenham is a large well built town upon the Avon, over which it has a bridge of &s;ixteen arches. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been a market from the beginning, its name in the Saxon im|porting as much. It was one of the chief towns of the We&s;t Saxons, but queen Mary fir&s;t incor|porated it, by the &s;tile of bailiff and burge&s;&s;es. Be&s;ides being a great thoroughfare between Lon|don and Bath, it has a well frequented market, and a manufacture of cloth. On the walls and windows of the church are the arms of the Hungerfords.</P>
<P>Malm&s;bury is almo&s;t &s;urrounded by the Avon and a brook that runs into it, over which are &s;ix pridges. Here was antiently a ca&s;tle, and the greate&s;t abbey in Wilt&s;hire, who&s;e abbot was mitred, and &s;at in parliament. It was fir&s;t called Ingleborn, and afterwards Maildulphbury, from Maildulphus, who lived as a hermit in a wood under the hill. Maildulphbury was after|wards contracted into Malm&s;bury. Maildulph founded the mona&s;tery; but it was greatly en|larged by his &s;cholar Aldhelm, who was held in &s;uch veneration by king Athel&s;tan, that he grant|ed the town large immunities for his &s;ake, en|riched the mona&s;tery, and was at la&s;t buried under
<PB N="140" REF="1440">
the high altar of the church, where his monument is to be &s;een at this day. It had its fir&s;t charter of incorporation from Edward, king of the We&s;t Saxons, and its la&s;t from William III. A great part of the abbey church &s;till remains, and is u&s;ed as the pari&s;h church. This town carries on a con|&s;iderable trade in the woollen manufacture, and is noted for being the birth-place of William, &s;urnamed of Malme&s;bury, and Mr. Hobbes, the author of the Leviathan. It is a neat town, and governed by an alderman, cho&s;en annually, twelve capital burge&s;&s;es, four a&s;&s;i&s;tants, landholders, and commoners.</P>
<P>Cricklade &s;tands at the influx of the Churn and Rey into the Thames, and contains near fourteen hundred hou&s;es. It is an antient borough by pre&s;crip|tion, and is governed by a bailiff.

Here was antiently a ca&s;tle, the ditches of which are &s;till vi&s;ible in the &s;outh part of the town; and here was born that famous phy|&s;ician Dr. Thomas Willis, of Oxford. In the church, which is a &s;tately fabric, among other monuments, is one of Sir John Seymour, father of the Protector. The town is governed by a portreve, cho&s;en by a jury at the court-leet of the lord Bruce, lord of the manor; and the portreve chu&s;es a bailiff and other officers.</P>
<P>Ludger&s;hall, another antient borough by pre|&s;cription, though now no better than a hamlet, is &s;ituated in a delightful country near the fore&s;t of Chute. It is governed by a bailiff annually cho&s;en at the court-leet of the lord of the manor.
<PB N="141" REF="1450">
Wooton-Ba&s;&s;et is a borough both by charter and pre&s;cription. It takes its name from the fa|mily to which it antiently belonged. Though governed by a mayor, aldermen, and burge&s;&s;es, yet it is &s;o mean a place, that the mayor is gene|rally &s;ome poor mechanic.</P>
<P>Marlborough is thought to take its name from the hill of chalk at the foot of which it &s;tands, chalk having been antiently called marle. It was one of the Roman &s;tations, called Cunitio by An|toninus, and had afterwards a ca&s;tle, in which, in Henry III's time, was held a parliament, which enacted tho&s;e laws called the Marlborough-&s;tatutes. It formerly gave title of earl to a family of the name of Ley; but now that of duke to a de|&s;cendant of the ever-victorious general, John, fir&s;t duke of Marlborough, who was advanced to that honour for his great &s;ervices by her maje&s;ty queen Anne. It is a great thorough|fare betwixt London and Bath, has &s;everal com|modious inns, and con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of one broad &s;treet pretty well built. There are &s;till &s;ome remains not only of the ca&s;tle, but al&s;o of a priory, and of the Roman Ca&s;trum, where coins are often found. There is little trade or ma|nufactures in the town, though the Kennet was made navigable &s;ome years age from hence to Reading. It is a corporation by charter from &s;e|veral kings, and the lord Bruce is lord of the ma|nor.</P>
<P>Trowbridge, which had its name from the &s;tone|bridge at the we&s;t end of it, over the river Were. Here was antiently a ca&s;tle, of which nothing now remains; but a con&s;iderable manufacture of fine broad cloth is carried on in this town.</P>
<P>Bradford &s;tands upon the Lower Avon, over which it has a bridge. Here was once a mo|na&s;tery,

near which a bloody battle was fought between Kenelwachius, king of the We&s;t Saxons, and his kin&s;man Cuthred. A &s;ynod was al&s;o held here in the tenth century. This town, as well as others in its neighbourhood, is noted for the ma|nufacture of broad cloths, by which many great e&s;tates and families have been rai&s;ed. Betwixt this and Bath lies Holt, famous for its mineral waters.</P>
<P>Co&s;ham is a very healthy plea&s;ant village, and a thoroughfare from London to Bath, from which it is only nine miles di&s;tant. Near this &s;pot the Saxon king Ethelred had a palace, and kept his court; and here lady Mary Hungerford founded an alms-hou&s;e and free &s;chool. In the &s;outh &s;ide of this place is an old hou&s;e, in which Sir Richard Black|more, the poet and phy&s;ician, was born. The woollen manufacture is carried on here by &s;everal con&s;iderable clothiers. From Kingdown, in the neighbourhood, is a mo&s;t charming pro&s;pect.</P>

<P>Maiden-bradley had antiently a priory founded by Man&s;er Bi&s;&s;et, &s;ewer to king Stephen. In this town was born the famous republican and regicide, Edmund Ludlow, lieutenant-general of the armies of the commonwealth of Eng|land, and lord deputy of Ireland. Here is a fine &s;eat of the duke of Somer&s;et's; and at Longleat, in this neighbourhood, is one of the noble&s;t in the kingdom, belonging to lord Weymouth.</P>
<P>Mere. There is a hundred which takes its name from this place, of which it was once the principal town. It had antiently a ca&s;tle, and is now a &s;taple for wool. In Stourton-park, in its neighbourhood,

are the remains of a Dani&s;h camp; and there are &s;everal villages about it, that take their names from the little river Deveril, as King&s;ton-Deveril, Monckton-Deveril, Brixton-Deveril, Hill-Deve|ril, and Deveril-Longbridge.</P>
<P>Warmin&s;ter is a very antient town, which Camb|den &s;uppo&s;es to be the Verlucio of Antoninus, tho' no coins, or other remains of the Romans, have ever been di&s;covered about it. On the downs on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the town are two camps, one called Battlebury, thought to be Dani&s;h, from its double works; and another Scratchbury, which is a &s;quare fortification, with a &s;ingle trench. It has a great market for corn, and a greater malt-trade than any town in the we&s;t of England, be&s;ides its cloth and wool-trade. It has moreover good inns, and is a very populous thriving place. This, with &s;everal other towns in the county, was antiently the e&s;tate of the Hungerfords, and afterwards was given by Richard III. to Howard, duke of Nor|folk. We&s;t of the town is a high hill, call|ed Clay-hill, which on Palm Sunday is covered from top to bottom with young people from the adjacent towns and villages, who&s;e chief diver&s;ion is to &s;ee one another &s;lip and tumble to the bottom. On the &s;outh, north, and ea&s;t &s;ides of this town are the downs generally called Sali&s;bury plain. They extend near fifty miles from Sali&s;bury to Wey|mouth in Dor&s;et&s;hire. Formerly they were thought incapable of producing grain, and only fed &s;heep; but now, tho' they &s;till feed innumerable flocks of &s;heep, by turning up the land fir&s;t with the plough, and then folding their &s;heep on it, they have been made to yield plentiful crops of wheat, barley and rye On the&s;e plains is Wardour-ca&s;tle, which gives title of baron to lord Arundel of Wardour, a Roman catholic family.</P>

<HEAD>CURIOSITIES and ANTIQUITIES.</HEAD>
<P>On the ea&s;t &s;ide of Sali&s;bury is Clarendon-park, which gave title of earl to Sir Edward Hyde, lord|chancellor, in the reign of Charles II. It is very large and beautiful, and has twenty groves in it, each a mile in compa&s;s. Here were &s;everal palaces antiently, one built by king John, another called the King's-manor, and a third the Queen's, which is &s;till in being, as are &s;ome remains of the others. Al&s;o a &s;ynod was held here in the reign of Henry II. when archbi&s;hop Becket, and the other bi&s;hops, &s;wore to the ob&s;ervance of certain articles drawn up by the king, and called from hence the Con|&s;titutions of Clarendon. On a dry chalky-hill, half a mile from hence, between Old Sarum and Winche&s;ter, is a Roman camp, &s;aid to have been made or repaired by Chlorus, father of Con&s;tan|tine.</P>
<P>Stonehenge, reckoned one of the wonders of this i&s;land, is &s;ix miles to the north of Sali&s;bury. It con&s;i&s;ts of two circles and two ovals, re&s;pec|tively concentric, inclo&s;ed in a circular ditch. Some of the &s;tones weigh above forty tons, and would require above one hundred and forty oxen to draw them. They are not factitious, but were undoubtedly brought from among tho&s;e called the Grey Wethers, near Abury, on Marlborough downs, except the altar, which is a compo&s;ition of red, green, and white chry&s;tals, cemented by nature with opaque granules of a flinty or &s;tony matter. It &s;tands on the &s;ummit of a hill, or at lea&s;t pretty near it. Of the outer circle, which, when perfect, con&s;i&s;ted of thirty uprights, and thirty impo&s;ts, &s;eventeen uprights are left &s;tand|ing, and &s;ix impo&s;ts. Of the other uprights and impo&s;ts, &s;ome are lying upon the ground, entire
<PB N="145" REF="1490">
or broken, and &s;ome have been carried off. The inner circle con&s;i&s;ted originally of forty uprights, at the di&s;tance of eight feet from the outer circle, and lower by the half; but out of the forty, nine|teen only are left: the walk between is three hun|dred feet in circumference. The great oval con|&s;i&s;ts of ten uprights and five impo&s;ts; and the inner, with the altar, of twenty uprights, but &s;ome of the&s;e are broken or fallen. The whole number of which Stonehenge was compo&s;ed amounted to one hundred and forty. Dr. Stukely, to who&s;e Di&s;&s;ertation we refer tho&s;e who de&s;ire a more particular account, has made it more than probable, that it was the chief temple of the druids in this i&s;land. All round Stonehenge, and in &s;ight of it, are a great number of barrows, of a very elegant bell-like form, generally &s;urrounded with a ditch. They are almo&s;t all of them upon ri&s;ing-grounds, and in &s;ome places there are rows of them equidi&s;tant. Some have thought that there have been great battles upon the plain, and that the&s;e are the burial-places of the &s;lain; but they are really no other than the &s;epulchres of kings and great per&s;onages, buried in peace, and &s;et near this temple for the &s;ame rea&s;on that we bury in church-yards and con&s;ecrated ground. This county, be&s;ides other monuments of anti|quity, exhibits a va&s;t number of camps and forti|fications, Briti&s;h, Roman, Saxon, and Dani&s;h, e&s;pecially upon the downs. Of one of the&s;e at Aubery, on Marlborough downs, Dr. Stukely has given a very particular and curious de&s;crip|tion.</P>
<P>At Ambre&s;bury, a place of great antiquity, was antiently a famous mona&s;tery, afterwards con|verted into a nunnery, to which Eleanor, queen of King Henry III. retired, and in which &s;he died. In 1285, Mary, daughter of Edward I. and the
<PB N="145" REF="1500">
daughters of thirteen noblemen, took the veil; and here Aurelius and &s;everal Briti&s;h princes were buried. In the river Avon, on which the town &s;tands, a little fi&s;h called a loach is taken, which is u&s;ually put into a gla&s;s of &s;ack, and &s;wallowed alive.</P>
<P>Acro&s;s the &s;hire, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, runs a won|derful ditch, called Wan&s;dyke. Mr. Cambden thinks it was ca&s;t up for a boundary between the We&s;t Saxons and Mercians; but others are of opinion it was made by Cerdic, the fir&s;t king of the We&s;t Saxons and his &s;on Kenric, again&s;t the incur&s;ions of the Britons; the rampire and graft are very large. There are a great many more upon the plain, e&s;pecially about Stonehenge.</P>

<P>This county is bounded on the &s;outh by Hamp|&s;hire, on the we&s;t by Wilt&s;hire and Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, on the north by the Thames, which &s;eparates it from Buckingham and Oxford&s;hires, and on the ea&s;t by Middle&s;ex and Surrey. The origin of its name is uncertain, and therefore &s;hall not detain us. Its
<PB N="148" REF="1520">
length extends to thirty-nine miles, its breadth to twenty-nine, and its circumference to one hundred and twenty, within which it contains about five hundred and twenty-&s;even thou&s;and acres, eighty-five thou&s;and inhabitants, one hundred and forty pari&s;hes, of which &s;ixty-two are vicarages, twenty hundreds, &s;ixty-&s;even villages, and twelve market|towns.

<P>This county is one of the plea&s;ante&s;t in Eng|land, the air in general being good, and the &s;oil fertile, e&s;pecially in the vale of White Hor&s;e, &s;o called from the figure of that animal, cut out of a chalky rock, as it is thought, by the Saxons, who bore a white hor&s;e for their arms. The more barren parts of it lie upon the ea&s;t &s;ide, where are many woods and fore&s;ts, abounding with game, and the fine&s;t oak and beech. The principal rivers are the Thames and Kennet, which are well &s;tored with fi&s;h, particularly trout and cray-fi&s;h. The manufactures are chiefly woollen cloth, &s;ail cloth, and malt.

<P>In de&s;cribing the towns, we &s;hall begin, as u&s;ual, with the parliamentary boroughs.</P>
<P>Wind&s;or is thought to derive its name from the winding of the &s;hore of the Thames. It was given by Edward the Confe&s;&s;or to the monks of We&s;tmin&s;ter; but William the Conqueror brought
<PB N="149" REF="1530">
it back, by exchange, to the crown. It con&s;i&s;ts at pre&s;ent of &s;everal &s;treets, has great privileges and immunities, and is governed by a mayor, high|&s;teward, under-&s;teward, town-clerk, two bailiffs, and other officers &s;ubordinate to them. By a grant from James I. of the manor or honour of Wind&s;or to the corporation, it has authority over &s;everal lord|&s;hips, as the dean and canons have over many pe|culiars. William the Conqueror fir&s;t built a ca&s;tle here, with lodges in the adjoining fore&s;t; Henry I. rebuilt and fortified it. The bi&s;hop of Durham, who was one of the regents of the king|dom during Richard I's ab&s;ence in the Holy Land, re&s;ided in the ca&s;tle; and Eleanor, wife to Edw. I. had four children born in it. Edward III. who was born here, and on that account called Edward of Wind&s;or, built the palace-royal and chapel, St. George's hall and chapel, the lodgings on the ea&s;t and &s;outh-&s;ides of the inner court, the tower in the middle, the hou&s;es for the dean and canons in the outer-court, with all the walls, towers, and gates; all which he fortified with ditches, ram|parts, towers, and &s;everal other places of &s;trength. The whole con&s;i&s;ts of two large courts, with a tower betwixt them, and is about a mile in com|pa&s;s. <Q>William of Wickham, then the court archi|tect, afterwards bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, planned and directed the work; whence upon the inner wall of the little tower are the&s;e words: &startq;This made Wickham.&endq;</Q> Edward IV. rebuilt St. George's-chapel, and the hou&s;es of the dean and canons. Henry VII. added the fine building joining to the king's lodgings; Henry VIII. the great gate that opens into the outer court; Ed|ward VI. and queen Mary erected a curious foun|tain in the middle of the inner court; and queen Elizabeth made the noble terrace, faced withfree|&s;tone ramparts, like tho&s;e of a fortified city,
<PB N="150" REF="1540">
where &s;he u&s;ed to walk an hour before dinner, if the weather was not windy. This terrace affords one of the fine&s;t pro&s;pects in the world, extending along the river on one &s;ide to London, and on the other to Oxford. King Charles II. laid out great &s;ums in further improvements and embelli&s;hments of the palace, as did king James II. and William, e&s;pecially in the article of paintings, of which there is a great variety by the mo&s;t eminent ma&s;|ters, &s;o numerous, that it would require a volume to de&s;cribe all the pictures and rich furniture. The apartments for &s;tate, beauty, and convenience, are as fine as any in Europe, and larger and loftier than tho&s;e of the &s;o much boa&s;ted palace of Ver|&s;ailles. The hall, de&s;igned from the fir&s;t in&s;titu|tion of the noble order of the Carter for enter|taining the knights at their in&s;tallation, is one of the fine&s;t rooms in the world, and the paintings &s;uitable to its magnificence. The royal chapel is one of the neate&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful in England, and the carved work exceeds any thing of the kind in this i&s;land. The tower above-mentioned is the habitation of the governor or con&s;table of the ca&s;tle, fitted up &s;uitable to his dignity; and as often as he or the court is at Wind&s;or, the &s;tandard is erected on the top of it. St. George's chapel is one of the mo&s;t beautiful and &s;tately Gothic buildings to be &s;een at this day, and di&s;plays not only the grandeur of the court in tho&s;e times, but the &s;pirit and genius of its magnanimous founder. There is nothing remaining of the kind &s;o antient and &s;o beautiful, both within and without, it having with&s;tood the attacks of time to admiration. The yearly revenue of this church, before it was &s;et apart to be the chapel of the order, was above one thou&s;and pounds, a prodigious &s;um in tho&s;e days. In the choir are the &s;talls of twenty-&s;ix knights of the order, and their banners over them,
<PB N="151" REF="1550">
with a throne for the &s;overeign. As the knights die, their banners are taken down, and their coats of arms and titles, engraved on little copper-plates, are nailed to the &s;talls. It appears from the re|gi&s;try of the order, that there have been eight emperors of Germany, thirty kings, ten electors of the empire, thirteen other &s;overeign princes, &s;ix princes of Orange, peers of France, grandees of Spain, &amp;c. companions of this mo&s;t noble order, be&s;ides our own kings, and tho&s;e of our no|bility and gentry; of the former of which the Ratcliffs, Talbots, Howards, de Grays, Manners, Ha&s;tings, Nevils, Spencers, Montagues, Browns, Savilles, Sheffields, Mohuns, Herberts, Bridgets, and Wallops; and of the latter, the Hollands, Wingfields, Fal&s;taffs, Stapletons, are the chief. Here is al&s;o a college, con&s;i&s;ting of a dean, twelve &s;ecular canons, thirteen prie&s;ts or vicars, four clerks, &s;ix choiri&s;ters, and twenty-&s;ix alms-knights, be&s;ides other officers, founded by Edward III. and incorporated by the name of the dean and ca|nons of the free-chapel of St. George within the ca&s;tle of Wind&s;or, by Edward IV. The alms|knights are now only eighteen, and are &s;tiled the poor knights of Wind&s;or, and have forty pounds a year. They are obliged by their order to go in their robes, twice a day, to church, to pray for the &s;o|vereign and the knights of the Garter. In the chapel lie interred the bodies of Hen. VIII. and one of his queens, as al&s;o tho&s;e of Henry VI. of Edward IV. who has a fine monument of &s;teel over him, and of Charles I. In a little chapel lies the dukes of Beaufort, de&s;cended from the dukes of Lanca&s;ter. At the we&s;t end of the &s;quare are the hou&s;es of the &s;inging men, with each a little gar|den behind it, the apartments of the canons, &amp;c. and at the bottom of the &s;quare is the library. On the &s;outh &s;ide of the chapel is an oratory, in which
<PB N="152" REF="1560">
prayers are read twice a day. There are two parks, the great and the little, the former fourteen, and the latter not much more than three miles in circumference, which has fine walks, a charm|ing lodge for the keeper, and is well &s;tocked with deer. In the hou&s;e of office in the lodge is the hi&s;tory of the expedition to Mexico by Cortez, painted on mother of pearl, and pre&s;ented to ad|miral Churchill out of the &s;poils taken at port St. Mary and Vigo. The great park is extremely beautiful, and full of game. In it are &s;everal fine lodges, particularly that of the keeper, and the one called Cranburn, or the duke's lodge, from his late royal highne&s;s the duke of Cumberland, who generally re&s;ided there, b$ing ranger of both parks: at pre&s;ent his maje&s;ty's third brother, the duke of Cumberland, is ranger. Though the lodge was extremely beautiful before, both by art and nature, as it &s;tands on the top of a hill, and commands a mo&s;t inchanting pro&s;pect, with very large and elegant gardens, yet his late royal high|ne&s;s made it &s;till more delightful by various em|belli&s;hments.</P>
<P>Reading is &s;uppo&s;ed to have derived its name from the fern which grew hereabouts, called in the Briti&s;h tongue Redin. The Thames almo&s;t enclo&s;es the town, and hard by receives the Kennet, over which are &s;even bridges in or near the town. Here was formerly a &s;trong ca&s;tle, which was demoli&s;hed by Henry II. The Danes are &s;aid to have retreat|ed to it, when they were defeated by king Ethel|wolph, at Inglefield, in this neighbourhood. Near the &s;pot where the ca&s;tle &s;tood, Henry I. pulled down a nunnery, and erected a mo&s;t mag|nificent abbey, and endowed it with great revenues for the refre&s;hment of travellers. He and his queen, and, as &s;ome think, his daughter Maud, were buried in it. After the di&s;&s;olution of the mona&s;teries it was converted into a royal &s;eat,
<PB N="153" REF="1570">
which is now in ruins. Its la&s;t abbot, Faringdon, was hanged, drawn, and quartered, with two of his monks, for refu&s;ing to &s;urrender it on demand. In the civil wars it declared for the king; but was reduced, after a &s;iege of ten days, by the parlia|ment forces. It is now a very large and flouri&s;hing town, being a great thoroughfare, and carrying on a con&s;iderable trade in malt, meal, and timber, which is conveyed to London by the Thames. It was formerly very eminent in the cloathing trade. Archbi&s;hop Laud, who founded an ho&s;pital here, was de&s;cended from a family of clothiers of this town. Some of the barges in which their malt is &s;ent to London will carry one thou&s;and or twelve hundred quarters. They bring back from thence coals, &s;alt, tobacco, grocery-wares, oils, &amp;c. The number of inhabitants is computed at eight thou|&s;and. Here in 1688 began the cry, called the Iri&s;h cry, that the Iri&s;h were plundering, burning, and cutting throats, wherever they came, which occa&s;ioned &s;uch an univer&s;al con&s;ternation, that every place was up in arms to defend it&s;elf. There is a great natural curio&s;ity near this town, viz. a continual &s;tratum of oy&s;ter-&s;hells for five or &s;ix acres, of which a particular account is given in the &s;econd volume of Lowthorp's Abridgement. The corporation con&s;i&s;ts of a mayor, twelve aldermen, and as many burge&s;&s;es, be&s;ides other officers. At this town the a&s;&s;izes are &s;ometimes held: it al&s;o boa&s;ts of a &s;tately county infirmary; and here lord chief-ju&s;tice Holt was born.</P>
<P>Wallingford is a very pretty town upon the Thames. It is, according to Cambden, the Gal|lena of Ptolemy and Antoninus, and the capital of the Attribatii. Of Gallena, a little altered, and of Ford, its pre&s;ent name, he thinks, it is compound|ed. It had formerly no le&s;s than fourteen churches, be&s;ides a collegiate chapel in its ca&s;tle, which was one of the large&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t in England,
<PB N="154" REF="1580">
and was annexed, with the honour, to the earldom of Cornwall. Cambden was of opinion, that it was a work of the Romans, being intire in his days, but now altogether in ruins. The town &s;uffered greatly by a plague in the reign of Edward III. and afterwards by the lo&s;s of the road to Gloce&s;ter, when the bridges were built at Abing|don and Dorche&s;ter: notwith&s;tanding which, it is at this day a large, hand&s;ome town, governed by a mayor, high-&s;teward, recorder, five aldermen, who are ju&s;tices of the peace within the borough, a town-clerk, two bailiffs, a chamberlain, and eighteen a&s;&s;i&s;|tants. Here are two churches, a hand&s;ome town hall, two good &s;treets, and a free-&s;chool. The town has a right to the rents and profits of its markets, and the a&s;&s;izes are &s;ometimes held in it. Its manufac|ture of malt, and the convenience of &s;ending that and other commodities to London by water, are its chief &s;upport. Near it is Cho&s;eley farm, &s;aid to be one of the greate&s;t in England, being let at one thou&s;and pounds a-year.</P>
<P>Abingdon took its pre&s;ent name from an abbey built there by Ci&s;&s;a, king of the We&s;t Saxons, which grew by degrees to &s;uch magnificence, as to vie with any abbey in Britain for riches and grandeur. The town, which at fir&s;t had its chief dependence upon the abbey, became con&s;ider|able after Henry V. had built bridges over the Ou&s;e, and turned the high-road hither for a &s;horter cut. Before the abbey was built it was called Sheove&s;ham. When the bridges were erected, the be&s;t artificers had but a penny a day, wheat being then at a &s;hilling a quarter. In the Saxon times &s;everal &s;ynods were held in it. Henry II. was educated in the abbey, of which nothing is now left &s;tanding but the We&s;t-gate. One Mr. Barbour was a great benefactor to this town, par|ticularly by promoting the building of the bridges
<PB N="155" REF="1590">
and cau&s;eways between them. The a&s;&s;izes are often held here, and the public bu&s;ine&s;s of the county is tran&s;acted in a large hall above the market hou&s;e, &s;tanding upon lofty pillars of mo&s;t curious a&s;hler-work. The corporation, con&s;tituted by queen Mary, con&s;i&s;ts of a mayor, two bailiffs, nine aldermen, called principal bur|ge&s;&s;es, an high-&s;teward, recorder, town - clerk, and &s;ixteen, or more, &s;econdary burge&s;&s;es, who, &s;ince the di&s;&s;olution of the abbey, are entitled to the profit of its market and fairs. The chief trade of the town is in malt, which they &s;end, with other commodities, to London. It gives title of earl to a younger branch of the Bertie family; and has two churches, two alms-hou&s;es, a free and a cha|rity-&s;chool, be&s;ides an ho&s;pital called St. Helens. Here Whitlock, author of the Memoirs, is &s;aid to have been born.</P>
<P>The other places in this county worth mention|ing are, Farringdon, a hand&s;ome town upon a hill, at one end of the vale of White-hor&s;e. It has a large church, and is governed by a bailiff.</P>
<P>Wantage, a pretty neat town. Here was an|tiently a royal &s;eat, where king Alfred was born. Its downs, about a mile off, are noted for hor&s;e|races.</P>
<P>Hungerford, tho' &s;ituated upon a great road, and the river Kennet, is not con&s;iderable. Its trouts and cray-fi&s;h are reckoned very fine. The town formerly gave name and title to the barons of Hungerford: of which family, Sir Thomas was the fir&s;t &s;peaker of the hou&s;e of commons, in the reign of Edward III. Walter, his &s;on, who was the fir&s;t baron and &s;teward of the hou&s;hold to Hen|ry V. held the ca&s;tle and barony of Homet, in Nor|mandy, by this tenure, that he &s;hould find the king and his heirs at the ca&s;tle of Roan a lance with a fox's tail hanging to it. The con&s;table of the town
<PB N="156" REF="1600">
is now lord of the manor, and holds it immediate|ly of the king. They have a horn, holding about a quart, given them, as the in&s;cription &s;ays, by John of Gaunt, together with the royal fi&s;hery in a certain part of the river.</P>
<P>Newbery or Newbury, i. e. the new borough, which name it acquired from its growing up as the antient Spinae of the Romans decayed. The latter is now a village in the neighbourhood, called Spinham land. Notwith&s;tanding its name, it is as old as the conque&s;t, was formerly noted for its manufacture of broad cloth, and &s;till makes a great quantity of &s;halloons and druggets; in con|&s;equence of which, and its lying upon the Bath road, with the river Kennet running thro' the town, it is far from feeling any &s;ymptoms of age or decay. At this place were two bloody engagements be|tween Charles I. and the parliament, at both which the king him&s;elf was pre&s;ent. Fine trout, eels, and cray fi&s;h are caught in the Kennet; and at the &s;and-pits near the town &s;everal prote&s;tants are &s;aid to have been burnt in the reign of queen Mary. It is governed by a mayor, high-&s;teward, recorder, aldermen, and capital burge&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>I amborn, or Langborn, has its name from a little river that runs by it, and &s;tands on the &s;outh-&s;ide of White-hor&s;e-hill. The river is re|markable for being always full in &s;ummer, but en|tirely lo&s;t in winter, the winter going off about Michaelmas. At Dennington, or Dunnington, in the neighbourhood, Chaucer is &s;aid to have lived, and to have compo&s;ed many of his poems under an oak, which was &s;tanding about twenty or thirty years ago.</P>
<P>Sunning, a village &s;ituated on the Thames, was antiently the &s;ee of eight bi&s;hops, who had a palace and park here; but it was tran&s;lated
<PB N="157" REF="1610">
fir&s;t to Sherburn and then to Sali&s;bury, to who&s;e bi&s;hops this village &s;till belongs.</P>
<P>Maidenhead, a pretty large well built town upon the Thames, over which it has a wooden bridge, maintained by the corporation, who, for that end, are allowed the tolls both over and under, and three trees yearly out of Wind&s;or fore&s;t, towards keeping it in repair. It is governed by a high|&s;teward, a mayor, a &s;teward, and ten aldermen; and out of the latter are cho&s;en every year two bridge-ma&s;ters. The mayor is clerk of the market, coroner, judge of the court, which is holden once in three weeks, a ju&s;tice of the peace, together with his predece&s;&s;or and the &s;teward, and, in conjunc|tion with the aldermen, has power to make bye|laws. The revenue of the town con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of the tolls of the bridge and market. It has a gaol both for debtors and felons, a great trade in malt, meal, and timber, which are &s;ent in barges to London; and is a con&s;iderable thoroughfare upon the Bath-road. There is a wood in the neigh|bourhood noted for robberies, called Maiden|head-thicket.</P>
<P>Bray, where, as Cambden thinks, was the ha|bitation of the Bibroci, who &s;ubmitted to Cae&s;ar when he cro&s;&s;ed the Thames, and from whom he imagines the place had its name: but it owes its pre&s;ent fame more to its vicar than to its an|tient inhabitants. This vicar was twice a papi&s;t and twice a prote&s;tant, in the reigns of Henry VIII. Edward VI. queen Mary, and queen Elizabeth. Being a&s;ked how he came to change his principles &s;o often, he replied, that he was determined to live and die vicar of Bray.</P>
<P>Okingham, the chief place in Wind&s;or fore&s;t, is a pretty large town, and has a manufacture of &s;ilk &s;tockings. It has a free-&s;chool and ho&s;pi|tal, and the corporation con&s;i&s;ts of an alderman,
<PB N="158" REF="1620">
recorder, and capital burge&s;&s;es. The fore&s;t in which it &s;tands gave birth to Mr. Alexander Pope, who out of filial duty, affection, and grati|tude, has given a mo&s;t beautiful de&s;cription of it.</P>

<HEAD>ANTIQUITIES.</HEAD>
<P>The antiquities of this county, be&s;ides tho&s;e al|ready mentioned, are a camp almo&s;t of a round figure at A&s;hbury-park, near King&s;ton-Li&s;le. A large camp of a quadrangular form, and &s;ingle works, a mile above Wantage. Great numbers of Roman coins, lamps, &amp;c. have been di&s;covered on St. Leonard's-hill near Wind&s;or. A large camp at Ea&s;t Hemp&s;ted, in Wind&s;or-fore&s;t, called Cae&s;ar's camp. At Laurence-Waltham &s;everal Roman coins, e&s;pecially of the ea&s;tern emperors, have been dug up, and from the bricks and other ruins, it is &s;uppo&s;ed there was a Roman fort there. Cherbury ca&s;tle, within two miles of Denchworth, an orbicular rampart, treble ditched, &s;aid to have been the ca&s;tle of the Dani&s;h king Canute. Ick|leton-way, part of Icknild-&s;treet, which may be traced to Strateley. Tombs and &s;tatues of an extraordinary &s;ize, about four miles ea&s;t from Ea&s;t Il&s;ley, which the country people think were made for giants; but the antiquaries &s;ay for the family of la Beche, who had a ca&s;tle here. Above White|hor&s;e-hill a camp very large, but with &s;ingle works: and at about two furlongs di&s;tance, a barrow called Dragon-hill, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the tumulus of Uther Pendragon.</P>

<HEAD>BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>This county, which derives its name from its &s;ituation amid&s;t the three kingdoms of the Ea&s;t, We&s;t, and South Saxons, is bounded on the we&s;t by Buckingham&s;hire, from which it is &s;eparated by the little river Coln and the &s;hire ditch; on the north by Hertford&s;hire; on the ea&s;t by the river Lea, which parts it from E&s;&s;ex; and on the &s;outh by the Thames, which divides it from Surry. It
<PB N="160" REF="1640">
is but of &s;mall extent. in length not exceeding twenty-one miles, in breadth fifteen, and in cir|cumference eighty; but, by rea&s;on of the cities of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter, and the numerous large villages in their neighbourhood, it is by far the mo&s;t populous and wealthy in England. The whole of it lies in the dioce&s;e of London, and is divided into &s;ix hundreds, two liberties, and &s;eventy-three pari&s;hes, which, be&s;ides London and We&s;tmin&s;ter, contain five market-towns. There are &s;everal royal parks in it, and a great many chapels of ea&s;e. The &s;heriffs are not appointed by the king, but cho&s;en by the liverymen of London.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>As the &s;oil is gravelly, and exceedingly well cul|tivated, in con&s;equence of the great number of inhabitants, the air is very pure and whole&s;ome. The great quantities of rich manure produced by &s;uch multitudes of people and cattle, has &s;o im|proved and enriched the lands, that they are ex|tremely fruitful in vegetables of all kinds. In the neighbourhood of London there is little or no corn, the land being employed either for feeding cows, rai&s;ing hay, or as garden grounds.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>London, the &s;eat and capital of the Briti&s;h em|pire, has been &s;o fully and &s;o often de&s;cribed, that it would be altogether &s;uperfiuous to enter into a minute account of it: we &s;hall therefore content our&s;elves with a very brief and general de&s;cription,</P>
<P>As to the etymology of the name it is uncertain, and therefore &s;hall not detain us. This city is in|ferior to few or none in re&s;pect of extent, wealth,
<PB N="161" REF="1650">
and populou&s;ne&s;s; but in re&s;pect of trade, in|du&s;try, politene&s;s, learning, and ingenuity, it at lea&s;t equals, if not exceeds, all the other cities of the world. It is &s;ituated upon a declivity, and on a gravelly &s;oil, along the north &s;ide of the Thames, where the river forms a kind of cre&s;cent. Of the part which lies within the walls, and is properly called the city, the extent is not great; but reckoning from Hydepark-corner to Poplar, the length is about &s;even miles and a half, and the breadth from the &s;tones-end at Newington-Butts in Surry, to Jeffry's alms-hou&s;es, in King&s;land road in Mid|dle&s;ex, upwards of three miles: hence the cir|cumference of the whole is almo&s;t eighteen miles. It appears to have been founded between the reigns of Julius Cae&s;ar and Nero, but by whom is uncertain; for we are told by Tacitus, that it was a place of great trade in Nero's time. From that period it has been continually increa&s;ing, tho' with many interruptions from enemies and fires, e&s;pecially that in the reign of Charles II. Under the Romans it was neither a municipium nor colony, but only a prefecture, and on that ac|count termed Oppedum by Tacitus; yet it was even then the capital of the i&s;land. It was fir&s;t walled about with hewn &s;tone and Briti&s;h bricks by Con&s;tantine the Great, at the reque&s;t of Helena his mother, and the walls formed an oblong &s;quare, in compa&s;s about three miles, with &s;even principal gates. The &s;ame emperor made it a bi&s;hop's &s;ee; for it appears that the bi&s;hop of London was at the council of Arles in the year 314: he al&s;o &s;et|tled a mint in it, as is plain from &s;ome of his coins. The city afterwards took the name of Augu&s;ta; but whether from Helena Augu&s;ta, the mother of Con&s;tantine, or from the Legio Secunda Au|gu&s;ta, is uncertain. It did not, however, long enjoy that lofty name, being again di&s;tingui&s;hed
<PB N="162" REF="1660">
by the more antient one of London. After the departure of the Romans, the Saxons got po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of and plundered it; but when they embraced Chri&s;tianity, it ro&s;e again with a new and greater lu&s;tre: for Aethelbert, king of Kent, built a church dedicated to St. Paul, which, by improvements and additions at &s;everal times, became very large and magnificent, and was not quite fini&s;hed till about the year 1312. This church, after &s;everal reparations, was at la&s;t intirely con&s;umed in that dreadful conflagration which happened in 1666. In the Saxon and Dani&s;h wars the city &s;uffered greatly, having been often &s;acked, plundered, and de&s;troyed; but from the conque&s;t till 1666, it had not felt any very &s;ignal calamity, tho' many fires had happened, the hou&s;es being then mo&s;tly of wood. What hath befallen it &s;ince that time to the pre&s;ent, is &s;o well known, that it is needle&s;s to relate particulars. Within the walls are nine|ty-&s;even pari&s;hes, and &s;eventeen without. The number of inhabitants is computed at &s;even hun|dred and twenty thou&s;and. The city is divided into twenty-&s;ix wards, over each of which an alder|man pre&s;ides, who, with the chief magi&s;trate, called the lord-mayor, who is al&s;o an alderman, and has the charge of a ward, the two &s;heriffs, recorder, chamberlain, town-clerk, and two hundred and thirty-&s;ix common-council men, have the govern|ment of the city. The roads leading to it are very good; and it is plentifully &s;upplied with fuel, wa|ter, and provi&s;ions of all &s;orts. The principal &s;treets, &s;ince the late improvements, are very neat, clean, well paved, and lighted. Its charitable foun|dations for the relief of the poor in all the various di&s;tre&s;&s;es to which they can be liable, are no le&s;s the object of the admiration than applau&s;e of &s;trangers. The immen&s;e traffic and corre&s;pon|dence carried on by the merchants and trade&s;men
<PB N="163" REF="1670">
of this city, whether &s;ingly, or by companies, contributes in an extraordinary degree both to its own flouri&s;hing condition, and that of the whole nation. Some idea of its exten&s;ive commerce may be formed by the number of &s;hips in the Thames, who&s;e ma&s;ts appear like a fore&s;t, as well as by the duties paid on merchandize at the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, which &s;o far back as the year 1728 amounted to up|wards of two millions eight hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling; and by the incredible &s;ums of money rai&s;ed in it upon the credit of government, during the emergencies of war. The &s;urprizing wealth and populou&s;ne&s;s of London will further appear from a general e&s;timate of the following articles of pro|vi&s;ions con&s;umed in the cour&s;e of one year within the city and &s;uburbs of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter.</P>

The &s;ocieties and in&s;titutions for advancing reli|gion both at home and abroad, good manners, arts, &s;ciences, commerce, and manufactures, the &s;tudy of the laws, and of antiquities, claim like|wi&s;e our particular admiration and applau&s;e.</P>
<P>The government of the city of London, as already ob&s;erved, is ve&s;ted in the lord-mayor, al|dermen, &s;heriffs, recorder, chamberlain, and the common-council. The lord-mayor is cho&s;en on Michaelmas-day by the liverymen out of tho&s;e aldermen who have &s;erved the office of &s;heriff, but have not yet been mayors; the liverymen gene|rally return to the court of aldermen the two &s;eniors below the chair, of whom they chu&s;e one. He is &s;worn in at Guildhall on the fe&s;tival of St. Simon and St. Jude, October 28; and on Nov. 9, he goes to We&s;tmin&s;ter by water in great pomp, and is &s;worn in before the barons of the exchequer. He returns by water again, attended by the city companies in their barges, to Guildhall, where a magnificent entertainment is prepared, which the lord-chancellor, judges, foreign amba&s;&s;adors, mi|ni&s;ters of &s;tate, and many of the nobility, gene|rally honour with their pre&s;ence, and &s;ometimes even the king, queen, and princes of the blood. His juri&s;diction extends not only over the city and part of the &s;uburbs, but al&s;o over the river from the mouth of the Medway to Staines bridge. When he appears abroad, he wears a &s;carlet or purple robe with a gold chain, and is attended in his coach and &s;ix by a great many officers. Du|ring his mayoralty he re&s;ides at the man&s;ion-hou&s;e, which is richly furni&s;hed, and in which he keeps open table. If a lord-mayor refu&s;es to &s;erve after he is cho&s;en, he is liable to be fined.</P>
<P>The aldermen, who are twenty-&s;ix in number, pre&s;ide over the &s;everal wards, by whom they are cho&s;en. They are &s;uch for life, unle&s;s they chu&s;e to re&s;ign. The lord-mayor and aldermen have a great
<PB N="165" REF="1690">
&s;hare in the legi&s;lative, and almo&s;t the whole exe|cutive power in the city, and by them mo&s;t of the city officers are appointed. All that are above the chair are ju&s;tices of the peace, and the three elde&s;t below the chair. Each of them has one or two deputies to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the management of the affairs of the ward.</P>
<P>The two &s;heriffs are cho&s;en annually on Mid|&s;ummer-day by the liverymen. At Michaelmas they are &s;worn and enter upon their office. Each of them has an under-&s;heriff and other officers &s;ub|ordinate to them, When cho&s;en, they mu&s;t either &s;erve or pay a fine of five hundred pounds to the city, unle&s;s he will &s;wear him&s;elf not worth fifteen thou&s;and pounds. No alderman can be lord|mayor till he has &s;erved the office of &s;heriff.</P>
<P>The recorder and chamberlain are the next two chief officers and magi&s;trates in the city. The former is appointed by the lord-mayor and alder|men, and the latter cho&s;en by the liverymen, and both for life. Other officers who hold their places for life are the bridge-ma&s;ters, auditors of accompts, and ale-conners; but the&s;e are cho&s;en by the liverymen.</P>
<P>The court of common-council con&s;i&s;ts of the lord-mayor, aldermen, and common-council-men, cho&s;en by the hou&s;e-keepers in each ward. Bye|laws for the city are made by this court, and com|mittees for various purpo&s;es appointed.</P>
<P>There are many courts of ju&s;tice held in the city before one or more of the above named magi&s;trates; as the court of hu&s;tings, before the lord-mayor, aldermen, and recorder, in which the four members of parliament for the city are cho&s;en by the liverymen; the lord-mayor's court; the &s;heriffs courts; chamberlain's court; orphan's court, before the lord-mayor and aldermen once a year; court of con&s;cience, before two aldermen and four commoners, each of which has its par|ticular

department. Other a&s;&s;emblies are held in each ward, as wardmotes for chu&s;ing the officers and &s;ettling the affairs of the ward; and hall|motes, held at the halls of the re&s;pective compa|nies, for regulating matters relating to their trade.</P>
<P>With regard to the trade&s;men and mechanics, they are divided into companies, incorporated either by charters from kings, by pre&s;cription, or by act of parliament or common-council. Mo&s;t of the&s;e have halls, and a certain number of live|rymen, who pay a particular fine at their admi&s;&s;ion; and all of them have their different privileges and officers, di&s;tributing various &s;ums to their poor, and in other acts of charity. For further particulars, we refer the reader to the hi&s;tories of London; and to our general account of the commerce of the nation for what regards the trad|ing and monied companies.</P>
<P>As to the &s;hipping, it appeared from the gene|ral regi&s;ter kept at the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, that there were in the year 1732, one thou&s;and, four hun|dred, and &s;eventeen &s;hips belonging to the port of London, the crews of which amounted to twenty-one thou&s;and, &s;even hundred, and ninety-&s;even. Further, it appeared, that in the year 1727, eight thou&s;and, eight hundred, and eighty nine &s;hips, foreign or Briti&s;h, had arrived at London, and the number is thought to exceed that &s;ometimes con|&s;iderably. Betwixt London-bridge and Blackwall are a great number of docks, wet and dry, and yards for laying up, repairing, and building &s;hips, lighters, hoys, &amp;c. be&s;ides the great numbers of the two la&s;t that are built above bridge. The offices for en&s;uring &s;hips, goods, and merchan|dize from hazards by &s;ea, and for lending money on bottomree, are the Royal Exchange and Lon|don in&s;urance. There are others for en&s;uring hou&s;es and goods from lo&s;s and damage by fire, be&s;ides tho&s;e for en&s;uring lives.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="1710">
The militia of London&punc; con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ix regi|ments, each of which is divided into eight com|panies, making in all &s;even thou&s;and two hun|dred men, together with two regiments com|manded by the lieutenant of the Tower, and the artillery company, which, added to the others, make the whole amount to above ten thou&s;and men, including officers and drums. The officers are the lord-mayor, aldermen, and other principal citizens, who have their commi&s;&s;ions from the king.</P>
<P>With regard to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical government, the bi&s;hop of London takes place next to the arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury and York; but his revenue is not equal to that of Durham and Winche&s;ter. His dioce&s;e comprehends not only Middle&s;ex, E&s;&s;ex, and a part of Hereford&s;hire, but al&s;o the plantations. Several pari&s;hes having been erected &s;ince the fire in 1666, there are now only &s;ixty-two parochial churches, and of the&s;e &s;everal are pe|culiars. Their revenue, at a medium, is about one hundred and fifty pounds a year, be&s;ides the par&s;onage-hou&s;e and &s;urplice-fees.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the immen&s;e con&s;umption, this city is plentifully &s;upplied with provi&s;ions. The markets, be&s;ides Smithfield, for live cattle, and Leadenhall, for butchers meat, &amp;c. are Ho|ney lane, Newgate, and Fleet-markets for fle&s;h, fi&s;h, herbs, and fruits; Billing&s;gate and Fi&s;h|&s;treet-hill, for fi&s;h only; the three cranes in Queen|&s;treet, for apples and other fruit; Bear-key and Queenhithe, for corn, malt, and meal; and at Billing&s;gate, every morning, on a broad place at the head of the dock, called Roomland, mo&s;t of the coals con&s;umed in and about the city are bought and &s;old. With regard to water, both this city and We&s;tmin&s;ter are extremely well &s;up|plied from the Thames, or the New River brought
<PB N="168" REF="1720">
from Ware in Hertford&s;hire, and conveyed by pipes into every hou&s;e at a moderate expence.</P>
<P>It is proper to ob&s;erve here, that great altera|tions and improvements have been made lately, both with re&s;pect to the &s;treets in London and We&s;tmin&s;ter, mo&s;t of which have been new paved with &s;tone brought from Scotland, and in the Scotch manner. The &s;ign-po&s;ts have been taken down, or placed again&s;t the walls of the hou&s;es. A fine new bridge with elliptical arches, planned by that ingenious architect Mr. Mylne, is almo&s;t fini&s;hed at Black-friars; Fleet-ditch is arched over; a fine &s;treet is to be opened from the bridge, thro' Fleet-market, into the fields north of the city; and the &s;hore of the Thames, above and below the bridge next the city, is to be embanked, all in pur&s;uance of late acts of parliament.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid thus much in general of this great city, we will now give &s;ome account of the mo&s;t remarkable places in each ward.</P>
<P>Bridgeward takes its name from the bridge called London-bridge, which was fir&s;t of wood; but that being burnt down in the reign of king Stephen, another was built of &s;tone, which was not fini&s;hed till the tenth of king John, and &s;uffered much by a fire four years after. It had, till lately, a row of hou&s;es on each &s;ide, and was a very noble bridge for the time in which it was built; but the hou&s;es have been pulled down, and the whole &s;o much altered and improved, that it looks now as if it was quite new. Under the fir&s;t, &s;econd, and fourth arches, on the north &s;ide, are machines worked by the tides in the river, by which a con&s;iderable part of the city is &s;upplied with water. As this ward contains the whole bo|rough of Southwark, which lies in Surry, we &s;hall take notice of the other remarkable places in it under that county.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="1730">
Tower-ward derives its name from the Tower of London, as it is commonly called, which is of great extent, and very antient: it has a broad and deep moat running round it, and a &s;trong wall, on which a great many cannon may be mounted, by which it commands both the city and river; and be&s;ides the&s;e, there is a large battery of cannon oppo&s;ite to it, on the bank of the river. In this tower, our kings &s;ometimes formerly re&s;ided. Now the crown-jewels, the board of ordnance, a mint for coinage of money, a prodigious magazine of arms and artillery, a grand hor&s;e-armoury, and the archives of the na|tion, are kept in it. Without the walls is a place for lions, tygers, and other wild bea&s;ts. There are &s;everal hamlets belonging to the tower, who&s;e train-bands, amounting to about four hundred men, are obliged, when required, to do duty in it. In this ward is the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, a &s;pacious building with two wings: that called the long|room, is fifteen feet high, and runs the whole length of the building, which is one hundred and eighty-nine feet. Here the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;it, with their officers and clerks; and though the bu|&s;ine&s;s is immen&s;e, the cu&s;toms amounting to above two millions per annum, yet is it tran&s;acted with as much order and regularity as the common af|fairs of a merchant's counting-hou&s;e, built &s;aid the cu&s;toms of the port of London make two thirds of tho&s;e of all England. A little to the north of London-bridge, &s;tands a &s;tately pillar, called the Monument, erected very near the &s;pot where the great fire broke out in 1666, built of Portland &s;tone, and of the Dorick order, fifteen feet diameter, and two hundred and two feet high from the ground. The pede&s;tal, which is forty feet high, and twenty &s;quare, is adorned with cu|rious ba&s;s-reliefs. Within it is a winding &s;tair|ca&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting of three hundred and forty-five
<PB N="170" REF="1740">
&s;teps, and from the top is a noble pro&s;pect over the city.</P>
<P>Lime&s;treet-ward. In this ward is Leadenhall, the greate&s;t market, perhaps, in Europe, for but|chers meat, meal, and other provi&s;ions, leather, raw hides, wool, Colche&s;ter baize, &amp;c. the meal, wool, leather, and Colche&s;ter baize, are &s;old in the hall. It is remarkable, that though the ward runs through &s;everal pari&s;hes, there is no church or whole &s;treet in it: but, be&s;ides Leadenhall and the market, it contains the India-hou&s;e, erected by the company in 1726, which, though &s;pacious, is not at all &s;uited to the great figure the company makes at pre&s;ent in the trading world. It contains large warehou&s;es and rooms for the u&s;e of the directors and clerks, with a &s;pa|cious hall and court-yard for the reception of tho&s;e who attend on the company on court-days, which are every Wedne&s;day.</P>
<P>Broad-&s;treet-ward contains Gre&s;ham-college, founded by Sir Thomas Gre&s;ham in queen Eli|zabeth's time, for reading lectures on the &s;even liberal &s;ciences. By the will of the founder, the profe&s;&s;ors have each fifty pounds a year out of the rent of the Royal Exchange, with lodgings in the college; but &s;ince the in&s;titution of the Royal So|ciety, the&s;e lectures are in a manner de&s;erted, the profe&s;&s;ors having &s;eldom above three or four auditors, and the&s;e of the mo&s;t ordinary people. This building has been lately purcha&s;ed, in order to erect a &s;pacious exci&s;e-office. The bank of England, that repo&s;itory of immen&s;e wealth, &s;tands al&s;o in this ward. It was founded in the year 1732, in Threadneedle-&s;treet, and is now a very large and &s;tately fabric, having lately received great additions and improvements. In the hall, which is &s;eventy-nine feet in length and forty in breadth, is an elegant marble &s;tatue of king William III. their founder, with an in&s;crip|tion.
<PB N="171" REF="1750">
The ca&s;h is pre&s;erved in large vaults, that have &s;trong walls and iron gates. On the north &s;ide, towards Bartholomew-lane, is the accomp|tants office, which is &s;ixty feet long and twenty-eight feet broad; and on the room fronting the gate, the transfer office is kept. Waggons loaded with gold and &s;ilver bullion are often &s;een in the court-yard. In this ward are al&s;o &s;everal pari&s;h churches, with Carpenters-hall, Drapers-hall, Merchant-Taylors-hall, Pinners-hall, the South-Sea-hou&s;e, and the Pay-office. In the South-Sea-hou&s;e all the affairs of that company are tran&s;acted. In the Pay-office all the &s;tores for the u&s;e of the navy are paid for, and al&s;o the wages of the &s;ailors in his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Cornhill-ward; in which is &s;ituated the Royal Exchange, one of the large&s;t and fine&s;t of the kind in the world. The old one, built by Sir Thomas Gre&s;ham, having been de&s;troyed by the great fire in 1666, the foundation of the pre&s;ent &s;tructure was laid in 1667, and fini&s;hed in 1669. It is an oblong &s;quare of Portland &s;tone, and co&s;t &s;ixty-&s;ix thou&s;and pounds. There are arcades all round, paved with black and white marble, to which the merchants may retire from the &s;un and rain. The quadrangle within is one hundred and forty-four feet long, and one hundred and &s;eventeen broad. All round on the in&s;ide are niches, in mo&s;t of which are &s;tatues of the kings and queens of England, and in the centre of the area, that of Charles II. in a Ro|man habit. There are two gates, one on the &s;outh and another on the north &s;ide; and on the &s;outh &s;ide is a clock with chimes. A kind of gallery runs round the four &s;ides of the building, in which were formerly a great number of &s;hops, that are now de&s;erted. At pre&s;ent one &s;ide of it is employed as auction rooms for furniture; and in other apartments above &s;tairs, are the Royal Ex|change
<PB N="172" REF="1760">
a&s;&s;urance office, &amp;c. and in the vaults are the pepper warehou&s;es of the Ea&s;t-India company. All the niches above the piazzas are filled except four; but of the twenty-eight below only two are filled, one with the &s;tatue of Sir Thomas Gre&s;ham, and the other with that of Sir John Bernard, who is perhaps the only citizen who ever had the honour of having his &s;tatue erected in his life-time, mere|ly on account of his merit. All the &s;tatues were painted and gilt by a voluntary &s;ub&s;cription in the year 1754. In the area, on the in&s;ide of the ex|change, merchants meet every day at twelve at noon; and a prodigious concour&s;e of traders of all nations continue there till two, in order to tran&s;act bu&s;ine&s;s; but &s;oon after that hour the gates are &s;hut, and not opened again till four. For the readier di&s;patch of bu&s;ine&s;s, all the different na|tions and cla&s;&s;es of merchants have their &s;eparate walks. The churches in this ward are tho&s;e of St. Michael and St. Peter.</P>
<P>Walbrook-ward is remarkable for the man&s;ion|hou&s;e, built for the re&s;idence of the lord-mayor, dur|ing his mayoralty. It &s;tands where Stocks-market was kept formerly, and is a large and magnificent &s;tructure, worthy of the fir&s;t magi&s;trate of &s;o great a city. On digging for the foundation, the ground was found &s;o full of &s;prings, that there was a ne|ce&s;&s;ity for erecting it on piles. It is built of Port|land &s;tone, and adorned with a grand portico and pediment in the front. The apartments are very noble, e&s;pecially the Egyptian-hall, de&s;igned for public entertainments; but it has the misfortune to be &s;o crowded with hou&s;es, e&s;pecially on the &s;ides, that the rooms are dark. The pediment is adorned with a very noble piece in bas-relief, re|pre&s;enting the dignity and opulence of the city of London. In Cannon-&s;treet in this ward is that re|markable &s;tone, called London-&s;tone. It has been
<PB N="173" REF="1770">
there ever &s;ince the time of Ethel&s;tan, king of the We&s;t-Saxons; but why, or by whom, &s;et up is uncertain. In this ward is al&s;o the fine church of St. Stephen's Walbrook, Salter's-hall, and St. Swithin's-church.</P>
<P>Dowgate-ward. In Suffolk-lane, and the pari&s;h of St. Laurence Pountney in this ward, is Mer|chant-Taylors &s;chool, founded by that company in 1561. It has convenient apartments for the ma&s;ters and u&s;hers; and forty-&s;ix fellow&s;hips in St. John's-college in Oxford were appropriated to its &s;cholars by Sir Thomas White, the founder of that college. The &s;chool con&s;i&s;ts of eight forms, in which near three hundred boys have their edu|cation; of whom, according to the con&s;titutions of the company, one hundred are taught gratis, an hundred more at five &s;hillings, and fifty at two &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence a quarter. There are &s;eve|ral public examinations of the &s;cholars in a year, e&s;pecially on the 11th of June, when the vacant fellow&s;hips in St. John's college are filled up out of the &s;cholars of the upper-form. The head|ma&s;ter receives from the company a &s;alary of ninety pounds &s;ix &s;hillings per annum, and thirty &s;hil|lings for water, be&s;ides the quarterage from the &s;cholars, which renders his &s;alary very con&s;idera|ble. The fir&s;t u&s;her has thirty pounds a year, and the two la&s;t twenty-five pounds, and all of them have proper apartments. In this ward are al&s;o the pari&s;h church of Allhallows the great; to|gether with Plumbers-hall, Watermens-hall, Join|ers-hall, Innholders-hall, Skinners-hall, Tallow|chandlers-hall, and the Steel-yard.</P>
<P>Cordwainers &s;treet-ward is noted for the &s;tately church, called Bow-church, from the arches or bows with which its &s;teeple is adorned, and from which the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court, &s;tiled the Court of Arches, took its name, that court having
<PB N="174" REF="1780">
formerly been held there. The great bell of this church being heard all over London and its neigh|bourhood, it is &s;aid of one born in or about the city, that he was born within the &s;ound of Bow|bell. The pre&s;ent church was built after the fire in 1666, in which the former was de&s;troyed. The &s;teeple is much admired both for the de&s;ign and execution. Sir Chri&s;topher Wren was the architect. It has all the five orders in it, placed as they are u&s;ually expre&s;&s;ed. Tho' the dragon on the top of the &s;pire is ten feet long, and pro|portionably bulky, yet it is turned by the lea&s;t wind. There is an incident in relation to the &s;teeple of the old church worth mentioning: in 1196 it was taken and fortified by one Fitz-O&s;bert, a traitor, who, being &s;moaked out of it, was hanged, with nine of his a&s;&s;ociates, in Smithfield. The other churches in this ward are tho&s;e of St. Antholen and St. Mary Aldermary.</P>
<P>Cheap&s;ide-ward. Guildhall, or the town-hou&s;e of London, for holding the courts, and tran&s;act|ing the bu&s;ine&s;s of the city, &s;tands in this ward. It was begun in 1411, and fini&s;hed in 1431. Being much damaged by the fire in 1666, it was &s;oon after repaired and beautified. The great hall is one hundred and fifty-three feet in length, near fifty broad, and fifty-five feet high; and not to mention the figures of the giants, which are rather a deformity, is adorned with the city-arms, king's|arms, the arms of the twenty-four companies, tho&s;e of Edward the Confe&s;&s;or, and of England and France quartered together, the figure of Mo&s;es with the two tables of the Decalogue, the pic|ture of the abovementioned Edward and his queen, of king William and Mary, queen Anne, king George I. and II. and queen Caroline, their pre&s;ent maje&s;ties, and lord-chancellor Camden. Between the columns are tho&s;e of eighteen judges. The hall will hold near &s;even thou&s;and people for the
<PB N="175" REF="1790">
election of magi&s;trates and members of parliament. Be&s;ides the hall, it contains the lord-mayor's, and many other courts, the council-chambers, a great many offices, kitchens, pri&s;ons, &amp;c. Many of the colours and &s;tandards taken from the French at the battle of Ramellies, and pre&s;ented to the city by queen Anne, are likewi&s;e &s;tuck up in the hall. In this ward are al&s;o the pari&s;h churches of St. Mildred in the Poultry and St. Mary's Cole|church, Grocers-hall, Mercers-hall, and the Poultry-Compter.</P>
<P>Ba&s;&s;i&s;haw, or Ba&s;inghall-ward, takes one of its names from the hall now called Black|well-hall, but antiently Ba&s;inghall. It is a &s;quare building, with a court in the middle, &s;urrounded with warehou&s;es, where is a weekly-market for all the broad and narrow woollen cloths brought out of the country. Each piece of cloth pays one penny for pitching, and a half-penny per week re&s;ting. The profits, which are &s;aid to amount to eleven thou&s;and pounds per annum, are applied towards the &s;upport of Chri&s;t's-ho&s;pital, the go|vernors whereof have the whole management of the&s;e warehou&s;es. In this ward are al&s;o Coopers-hall, Ma&s;ons-hall, Weavers-hall, and Ba&s;&s;i&s;haw|church.</P>
<P>Cripple-gate-ward. In this ward is Sion college, built and appropriated to the u&s;e of the London clergy, in pur&s;uance of the will of Dr. Thomas White, vicar of St. Dun&s;tan's in the We&s;t, who al&s;o ordained that a &s;ermon &s;hould be preached be|fore them quarterly in Latin, and that they &s;hould afterwards have a good dinner. In 1664 they were incorporated by the name of the pre&s;ident and fel|lows of Sion-college. Here is a hand&s;ome hall, lodgings for the pre&s;ident, and chambers for the &s;tudents, together with a public library, and an alms-hou&s;e for twenty poor men and women, who
<PB N="176" REF="1800">
have each a room and between five and &s;ix pounds a year. In this ward are al&s;o the pari&s;h churches of St. Giles's, Cripplegate, St. Alphage, St. Al|ban's, Wood &s;treet, St. Michael's, Wood-&s;treet, and St. Mary's, Aldermanbury, Lamb's chapel, Dr. William's library, and the halls of the haber|da&s;hers, waxchandlers, plai&s;terers, brewers, cur|riers, bowyers, and loriners companies.</P>
<P>Farringdon-ward-within boa&s;ts of having within it that noble, beautiful, and &s;tupendous pile the cathedral of St. Paul, which takes up &s;ix acres of ground, is four hundred and &s;ixty-three feet from ea&s;t to we&s;t between the walls, two hundred and twenty-eight from north to &s;outh in the cro&s;s-i&s;le between the walls, one hundred and one from north to &s;outh in the nave between the walls, two hundred and fifteen from the pave|ment to the top of the cupola, three hundred and forty-four from the pavement to the top of the cro&s;s, and ninety from the pavement to the highe&s;t part of the arched roofing in the nave and choir. It was near forty years in building, was de&s;igned by Sir Chri&s;topher Wren, and co&s;t in the whole upwards of a million &s;terling. There are three grand porticoes, &s;upported by &s;tately columns, on the north, &s;outh, and we&s;t &s;ides. The nave and choir are paved with marble, and the altar with porphyry finely poli&s;hed. The dome is painted by Sir James Thornhill, with the hi&s;tory of St. Paul's conver&s;ion, and has on its vertex a neat balcony, and above that a beautiful &s;tone lan|thorn, near &s;eventy feet high, with a ball and a fine gilt cro&s;s at top. The church is built of Portland &s;tone, in form of a cro&s;s, in imitation of St. Peter's at Rome; and the expence of it was de|frayed by a duty on coals. On the ea&s;t &s;ide of the cathedral is the famous &s;chool called St. Paul's &s;chool, founded by Dr. John Collet, dean of St.
<PB N="177" REF="1810">
Paul's, in 1509, and endowed with hand&s;ome &s;tipends for a ma&s;ter, &s;ub-ma&s;ter, and u&s;her, to teach one hundred and fifty-three poor children of any county of England, or any nation. The ma|&s;ter, wardens, and a&s;&s;i&s;tants of the mercer's com|pany, are the governors of the &s;chool, and ad|mit the ma&s;ters and &s;cholars; &s;ome of whom, when they go to the univer&s;ity, have exhibitions for &s;even years, unle&s;s provided for &s;ooner. The upper-ma&s;ter has three hundred pounds a-year, be&s;ides the advantage of additional &s;cholars and boarders, by which he generally makes about two hundred pounds a-year more; the &s;econd ma&s;ter has two hundred and fifty pounds, and the third ninety pounds a-year. In Warwick-lane in this ward is the college of phy&s;icians, a &s;tately build|ing, tho' badly &s;ituated. It has &s;everal grand apartments, particularly the hall, committee-room, another where the members meet once a quarter, be&s;ides the library, di&s;pen&s;atory, theatre, preparing-room, and garrets to dry herbs; and is adorned with pictures, &s;culptures, &s;tatues, and bu&s;ts, particularly tho&s;e of king Charles II. Sir John Cutler, and doctor Harvey. In the hall two of the fellows meet twice a week, to di&s;pen&s;e advice and medicines to the poor gratis. The college con&s;i&s;ts of a pre&s;ident, cen&s;ors, fellows, candidates, ho|norary fellows, and licentiates, incorporated by charters from &s;everal kings, and ve&s;ted with &s;undry powers, privileges, and immunities; in con&s;e|quence of which they are not obliged to bear, or provide arms, or to &s;erve on juries. They may take &s;ix bodies a-year, executed at Tyburn, for the pur|po&s;es of di&s;&s;ection; and none but &s;uch as they li|cence, can legally practi&s;e phy&s;ic within London, or &s;even miles round it. They have a good li|brary, particularly of books relating to their own profe&s;&s;ion. Adjoining to Chri&s;t-church, in New|gate-&s;treet,
<PB N="178" REF="1820">
is the noble charity called Chri&s;t's-ho&s;|pital, a mo&s;t &s;pacious &s;tructure, founded by Ed|ward VI. for the poor children of both &s;exes of de|cayed citizens; of whom about one thou&s;and are ge|nerally maintained, clothed, and in&s;tructed, either in the ho&s;pital here, or in two hou&s;es at Ware and Hertford dependant upon it. In 1673, a mathe|matical-&s;chool was founded by Charles II. and en|dowed with three hundred and &s;eventy pounds a-year, and, in 1694, a writing &s;chool was erected by Sir John Moor, knight and alderman. The other &s;chools are a grammar-&s;chool, a &s;chool for the girls, who learn reading and needle-work; and there hath been lately added a ma&s;ter to teach the boys drawing. Of the boys, tho&s;e of the mo&s;t pro|mi&s;ing genius, after being &s;even or eight years on the foundation, are &s;ent to the univer&s;ity, &s;ome to &s;ea, and others are put out apprentices, with a &s;uit|able &s;um. They are dre&s;&s;ed in blue, whence they are called Blue-coat boys, and the ho&s;pital, Blue|coat ho&s;pital. There are three hundred governors, who appoint the officers of the ho&s;pital, and admit the children. It is a plea&s;ing &s;ight to behold the children at &s;upper on a Sunday evening in the hall. There are eight wards for the children's beds, that of the girls being &s;eparated from the re&s;t; and there is al&s;o a ward for the &s;ick. Each of the ma|&s;ters have one hundred pounds a-year, be&s;ides an additional &s;alary of twenty pounds allowed the grammer - ma&s;ter for catechi&s;ing the boys, his u&s;her has fifty pounds a-year: in &s;hort, twelve or thirteen hundred pounds a-year are expended in &s;alaries to the officers, clerks, and &s;ervants; and the &s;um di&s;bur&s;ed for the &s;upport of the ho&s;pital, amounts to between eleven and twelve thou&s;and pounds, for defraying of which the ho&s;pital has a great e&s;tate in lands and hou&s;es, be&s;ides the re|venue ari&s;ing from licen&s;ing the city carts, and

The other remarkable places in this ward are Chri&s;t's-church in Newgate &s;treet, St. Veda&s;t's in Fo&s;ter-lane, St. Martin's, Ludgate, and St. Martin's, Friday - &s;treet; Stationers-hall, Apothecaries-hall, Sadlers-hall, Embroiderers-hall, and Scots-hall: the la&s;t belonging to a corpora|tion for the relief of poor, &s;ick, aged, and reduced Scot&s;men and women. They al&s;o employ and in|&s;truct poor Scotti&s;h orphans, bury the dead, and give money to &s;uch as are di&s;po&s;ed to return to Scotland. The &s;ums di&s;tributed by this &s;ociety a|mount to about &s;ix hundred pounds a-year.</P>
<P>Ca&s;tle-Baynard-ward contains Doctor's-Com|mons, where the judges and lawyers belong|ing to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical and admiralty courts live in a collegiate way. Here are al&s;o offices, in which wills are depo&s;ited and &s;earched, and a court of faculties and di&s;pen&s;ations. Cau&s;es are likewi&s;e tried in this place by the court of admiralty, and by that of delegates. The epithet of commons is given to it, from the civilians commoning together, as in other colleges. The cau&s;es of which the ci|vil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical law do, or may take cogni|zance, are bla&s;phemy, apo&s;tacy from Chri&s;tianity, here&s;y, ordinations, in&s;titutions of clerks to bene|fices, celebration of divine &s;ervice, matrimony, divorces, ba&s;tardy, tythes, oblations, obventions, mortuaries, delapidations, reparation of churches, probate of wills, admini&s;trations, &s;imony, ince&s;t, fornication, adultery, &s;olicitation of cha&s;tity, pen|&s;ions, procurations, commutation of penance, right of pews, and others of the like kind. The prac|ti&s;ers in the&s;e courts are of two &s;orts, advocates and proctors. The advocates are &s;uch as have taken the degree of doctor of the civil law, and are re|tained as coun&s;ellors. The judges and advocates, if of Oxford, wear in court &s;carlet robes, and hoods lined with taffata; but if of Cambridge, white
<PB N="180" REF="1840">
minever, and round black velvet caps. The proctors, who are the attornies in the&s;e courts, wear black robes, and hoods lined with fur. Their library contains a great number of books of all &s;orts, e&s;pecially on civil law and hi&s;tory; and it mu&s;t be continually increa&s;ing, as every bi&s;hop, at his con&s;ecration, gives, at lea&s;t, twenty pounds, and &s;ome fifty pounds, towards purcha&s;ing books. Hard by, on St. Bennet's-hill, is the col|lege of heralds, incorporated by Richard III. It con&s;i&s;ts of the earl-mar&s;hal, or his deputy, three kings at arms, Garter, Clarencieux, and Norroy, &s;ix heralds, four pur&s;uivants, and eight proctors. In the college is a good library of books of heral|dry and antiquities, and the records of the coats of arms of all the names and families in England. All cau&s;es and differences relating to arms, atchieve|ments, and titles, are al&s;o heard here. In this ward are al&s;o &s;everal churches.</P>
<P>Farringdon-ward-without. In this ward are the two Temples, or inns for the &s;tudy and practice of the common law; Serjeants-inn, for the u&s;e of the judges and &s;erjeants; and &s;ix inns of Chan|cery, in which attornies are chiefly bred, viz. Clif|ford's-inn and New-inn belonging to the Temples; Staple's-inn and Bernard's-inn to Gray's-inn; and Furnival's-inn and Travy's-inn to Lincoln's-inn. The Temples are very neat, divided into &s;everal courts, having each their hall and library, and very plea&s;ant walks and gardens. In the trea&s;ury|chamber of the Middle-Temple is pre&s;erved a great quantity of armour, which belonged to the Knights-Templars, con&s;i&s;ting of helmets, brea&s;t and back-pieces, together with &s;everal pikes, a halbert, and two very beautiful &s;hields, with iron &s;pikes in their centres, &s;ix inches in diame|ter, and each above twenty pounds weight. They are curiou&s;ly engraved, and one of them
<PB N="181" REF="1850">
richly inlaid with gold: the in&s;ides are lined with leather &s;tuffed, the edges being adorned with &s;ilk fringe, and broad leathern bells are fixed to them for the bearer to &s;ling them upon their &s;houlders. Antiently at commons in the hall of the Inner-Temple, their bread &s;erved in&s;tead of plates, and they had no other drinking ve&s;&s;els than wooden cups; but at pre&s;ent they are allowed trenchers for their meat, and coar&s;e green earthen pots for their liquor. However, tho' the cu&s;tom of u&s;ing mean ve&s;&s;els &s;till prevails, yet there are few who fare better. All the members of the &s;ociety who have chambers are obliged to be in commons a fortnight every term, for which they pay about ten &s;hillings a week. Sixteen of the&s;e terms, with a regular cour&s;e of &s;tudy, qualifies a &s;tudent for the bar. The expences of admi&s;&s;ion, with other di&s;|bur&s;ements, amount to four pounds and two|pence; but in the Middle-Temple the charge of admi&s;&s;ion is five pounds, and the time to qualify a &s;tudent for the bar is twenty-eight terms. The chief officer of both hou&s;es is a trea&s;urer, who is annually elected from among the benchers, and who&s;e office is to admit &s;tudents, to a&s;&s;ign them their chambers, and to receive and pay all the ca&s;h belonging to the &s;ociety. An a&s;&s;embly, wherein the affairs of the &s;ociety are treated, is commonly held twice every term. The library in Garden - court, in the Middle-Temple, is open almo&s;t the whole year from morning to night. There is a church which &s;erves both &s;ocieties, and is a &s;tately Gothic &s;tructure, with many curi|ous monuments, &s;ome of them of knights-tem|plars. To it belongs a divine, commonly called ma&s;ter of the Temple, and a reader, with hand&s;ome &s;tipends: the ma&s;ter has al&s;o a hou&s;e and garden adjoining to the church. Formerly there was a fixed lecturer for Sundays in the afternoon, who had
<PB N="182" REF="1860">
eighty pounds a-year from each &s;ociety, convenient lodging, and his diet at the benchers table; but of late the lecture is carried on by various preachers appointed and paid by the trea&s;urers of the two hou&s;es. The other places of any note in this ward are, the Se&s;&s;ions-hou&s;e in the Old-Bailey, in which criminal cau&s;es, ari&s;ing in the city of London and county of Middle&s;ex, are tried before the lord mayor, recorder, and &s;ome of the judges, eight times a year. The Fleet-pri&s;on, allotted for the confinement of debtors from any part of the king|dom, and for &s;uch as are guilty of a contempt of the court of Chancery and King's-bench: it hath been a very convenient pri&s;on, but is now old and decayed. There is an area inclo&s;ed by high walls, in which the pri&s;oners divert them|&s;elves, together with a kitchen, and a coffee-hou&s;e. If any of the debtors can give &s;ecurity to the war|den, that he &s;hall be forth-coming, he may take a hou&s;e or lodging, and walk abroad any where within the rules, extending to one &s;ide of Lud|gate-hill, the Old-Bailey, and Fleet-lane. The chapel of the Rolls in Chancery-lane, in which the modern rolls and records of the nation are kept; when the&s;e grow too bulky, they are re|moved to the Tower. Within the liberty of the Rolls the city hath no authority. Bridewell is both an ho&s;pital and hou&s;e of correction, into which a royal palace, that formerly &s;tood here, was converted by Fdward VI. In the ho&s;pital are lodged twenty decayed trade&s;men, with about one hundred apprentices, who, when they have &s;erved their time, have their freedom, and ten pounds to &s;et them up. The&s;e youths, who are cloathed in blue-doublets and white-hats, are under particu|lar regulations, di&s;tingui&s;hing them&s;elves at all dangerous fires, by the dexterity with which they work an excellent fire-engine belonging to the
<PB N="183" REF="1870">
ho&s;pital, and the expedition and regularity with which they &s;upply it with water. In the hou&s;e of correction, &s;trumpets and other di&s;orderly per|&s;ons are &s;et to hard labour, corrected, or di&s;charged, as the governors think proper. Hard by is St. Bride's church, a &s;tately fabric, with a mo&s;t beau|tiful &s;pire of great height. St. Dun&s;tan's church, remarkable for a curious clock. Ely hou&s;e, over again&s;t St. Andrew's church, Holborn. This has been the city palace of the bi&s;hops of Ely for near five hundred years. St. Bartholomew's ho&s;pital, for the cure of the poor, &s;ick, and lame, from all parts of the kingdom was refounded by Henry VIII. out of an old infirmary and priory, and en|dowed with five hundred marks a year; to which the citizens covenanted to add as much for the relief of one hundred lame and infirm patients: but the revenues of the ho&s;pital are now &s;o much increa&s;ed, that the annual expence amounts to about ten thou&s;and pounds, and the number of patients in the ho&s;pital and locks to about &s;ix hundred, be&s;ides out-patients, officers, and &s;er|vants. The building is equally magnificent, ex|ten&s;ive, and commodious. Pity it is that &s;o noble and humane a foundation &s;hould want any thing to render it perfect, and that every &s;ick per&s;on who is admitted, except &s;uch as have &s;uffered by accidents, as the fracture or di&s;location of a bone, &s;hould be obliged to depo&s;it, or give &s;ecurity for the payment of a guinea, in ca&s;e of death, by which &s;ome of the poore&s;t and mo&s;t mi&s;erable ob|jects are excluded; which is al&s;o the ca&s;e of &s;everal of the other ho&s;pitals of this city. The governors are about three hundred, be&s;ides the lord mayor and aldermen. Contiguous to this ho&s;pital, on the north-&s;ide, is Smithfield, noted for its fair and weekly markets on Monday and Friday, the greate&s;t in England for all &s;orts of live cattle. In
<PB N="184" REF="1880">
the reign of the bloody popi&s;h queen Mary, it was &s;tained with the blood of many prote&s;tant martyrs. The la&s;t public edifice of this ward which we &s;hall mention, is Surgeon's hall in the Old Bailey, an elegant modern building, with a noble theatre for the purpo&s;es of anatomy. In this ward is al&s;o a narrow-&s;treet near Smithfield, called Cloth-fair, becau&s;e a fair for cloth was antiently kept in it, in which &s;everal eminent woollen-drapers &s;till live.</P>
<P>Coleman &s;treet-ward is di&s;tingui&s;hed by that &s;tately fabric called Bethlehem-ho&s;pital for the reception of lunatics. It is five hundred and forty feet long and forty broad, and is divided into a great number of cells, in which the unhappy patients, who are generally above two hundred, are taken care of without any expence to their friends, except cloaths, and burial when they die. Two hand&s;ome wings have been lately added for &s;uch lunatics as are incurable. The governors are the &s;ame as tho&s;e of Bridewell, and are mo&s;tly &s;ub&s;tantial citizens, with a pre&s;ident, who is ge|nerally an alderman. The galleries of the ho&s;pi|tal are divided in the middle by two iron grates, by which means all the men are placed at one end of the hou&s;e, and all the women at the other. St. Luke's ho&s;pital for lunatics is an improvement on that of Bethlehem: it is &s;ituated on the north &s;ide of the road, above Upper-Moorfields, in St. Luke's pari&s;h, and is &s;upported by private &s;ub&s;cription. In this ward are al&s;o Founders-hall, Armourers and Braziers-hall, and the Exci&s;e-office. In the la&s;t the commi&s;&s;ioners, who have each a &s;alary of one thou&s;and pounds a-year, receive the produce of the exci&s;e of beer, ale, and other liquors; of coffee, tea, and chocolate; of malt, hops, &s;oap, &s;tarch, can|dles, paper, calicoes, gold and &s;ilver wire, vellum, parchment, hides, and &s;kins, collected all over England, which they pay into the Exchequer.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="1890">
Having now gone thro' the &s;everal wards which contain any thing remarkable, we &s;hall only men|tion the remainder, viz. Aldgate, Alder&s;gate, Bread-&s;treet, Bi&s;hop&s;gate, Billing&s;gate, Candle|wick, Langbourn, Port&s;oken, Queenhithe, and Vintry. The city had formerly eight gates, of which &s;ix are now pulled down, Ludgate, Bi&s;hop&s;gate, Moorgate, Aldgate, Alder&s;gate, Crip|plegate. Tho&s;e that remain are Newgate and Temple-Bar, which la&s;t is the boundary of the city liberties on that &s;ide. Newgate is the county gaol for debtors, and a pri&s;on for the criminals both of London and Middle&s;ex.</P>
<P>We&s;tmin&s;ter. This city had its name from the &s;ituation of its abbey, antiently called a min&s;ter, in re&s;pect of that of St. Paul. That part proper|ly called the city of We&s;tmin&s;ter, comprehending the pari&s;hes of St. John and St. Margaret, was once an i&s;land formed by the Thames, called Thorney I&s;land, from the thorns with which it was over-run, and the abbey that &s;tood in it, Thorney-abbey. The liberties of We&s;tmin&s;ter contain the &s;everal pari&s;hes of St. Martin in the Fields, St. James, St. Anne, St. Paul, Covent-garden, St. Mary le Strand, St. Clement, Danes, $$ George, Hanover-&s;quare, and the precinct of the Savoy. The government, both of the city and liberties, is under the juri&s;diction of the dean and chapter of We&s;tmin&s;ter, in civil as well as eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, and their authority extends to the precinct of St. Martin le Grand, by New|gate-&s;treet, and in &s;ome towns of E&s;&s;ex, that are exempted from the juri&s;diction of the bi&s;hop of London and the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury; but the management of the civil part has, ever &s;ince the reformation, been in the hands of laymen, elected from time to time, and confirmed by the dean and chapter. The chief of the&s;e laymen are the high-&s;teward, the deputy-&s;teward, and the
<PB N="186" REF="1900">
high-bailiff, who hold their offices for life. There are al&s;o &s;ixteen burge&s;&s;es and their a&s;&s;i&s;tants, out of which are elected two head-burge&s;&s;es, one for the city, and the other for the liberties. Another officer is the high-con&s;table, who has all the other con&s;tables under his direction.</P>
<P>We now proceed to give a &s;hort account of the mo&s;t remarkable places in the pari&s;hes both of the city and liberties.</P>
<P>St. Margaret's pari&s;h. The places mo&s;t worthy our notice in this pari&s;h are, fir&s;t, the church, which is a large and elegant &s;tructure: it was fir&s;t founded by Edward the Confe&s;&s;or, but has been often rebuilt and repaired from that time to the year 1735, in which it was beautifully repaired at the expence of five thou&s;and pounds given by the parliament, being the church to which the hou&s;e of commons repair to hear &s;ermons upon the na|tional holidays; there is a particular &s;eat for the &s;peaker. Secondly, St. James's park, of which, at lea&s;t, the &s;outh &s;ide is &s;ituated in it, and there|fore may be de&s;cribed here. This park is near a mile and a half in circumference; on all &s;ides of it are very beautiful walks, and in the centre, ex|tending nearly the whole length of the park from ea&s;t to we&s;t, is a fine canal. On the &s;outh $Word$, near the ea&s;t end, is a wilderne&s;s; at the &s;ame $Word$ is the parade, where the hor&s;e and foot-guard$ rendezvous and perform their exerci&s;es. Front|ing the parade, to the &s;outh, &s;tands the trea&s;ure, a large ma&s;&s;y building of Portland &s;tone, contain|ing halls, apartments, and offices, for the various branches of bu&s;ine&s;s tran&s;acted by the commi&s;&s;ion|ers for executing the office of lord-high-trea&s;urer of England; and here a committee of the privy|council &s;it occa&s;ionally to hear appeals from the plantations. Here al&s;o is a &s;tately building lately erected by the government oppo&s;ite to Whitehall, called the Hor&s;e-Guards, becau&s;e &s;ome of them
<PB N="187" REF="1910">
daily mount guard there. Thirdly, Privy-garden. This was the garden belonging to Whitehall pa|lace before it was burnt down; but now it is quite open, and on &s;ome parts of it hou&s;es have been built by &s;everal noblemen, who have obtained grants of it for that purpo&s;e from the crown. Fourthly, the Almery or Ambry, to the &s;outh of Tothill-&s;treet, where the alms of the abbey is &s;aid to have been di&s;tributed formerly; and here the fir&s;t printing-pre&s;s u&s;ed in England was &s;et up in 1471, by the abbot of We&s;tmin&s;ter, and managed by Caxton, who brought it from Hol|land. Fifthly, the Sanctuary; &s;o was the abbey|yard formerly called, becau&s;e neither debtors could be arre&s;ted, nor criminals apprehended in it, but both bid defiance to ju&s;tice, as they do &s;till in popi&s;h countries; but this &s;candalous privilege was taken away at the reformation. Sixthly, the abbey-church of St. Peter. A church was fir&s;t built here by Sebert, king of the Ea&s;t Saxons, and dedicated to St. Peter. That having been de&s;troyed by the Danes, another was founded by bi&s;hop Dun&s;tan. Afterwards a far more magnificent church and a mona&s;tery were built by Edward the Confe&s;&s;or. But the pre&s;ent lofty fabric was erected by Henry III. and was fifty years in build|ing. Henry VII. afterwards added that mo&s;t cu|rious chapel, which &s;till goes by his name, for a burial place for him&s;elf and his family. Leland calls it the miracle of the world. The fir&s;t &s;tone of it was laid in January 1502, and the whole charge of it amounted to fourteen thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, a very great &s;um in tho&s;e days. It con|tains his own magnificent monument of &s;olid bra&s;s gilt, and a number of others belonging to kings and great men, very &s;plendid and noble. In the church al&s;o great numbers of eminent men, both in church and &s;tate, commanders by &s;ea and land, philo&s;o|phers, poets, &amp;c. are buried, or at lea&s;t have mo|numents.
<PB N="188" REF="1920">
In it our kings are not only buried, but crowned, with great pomp and &s;olemnity. In the ninth of queen Ann, four thou&s;and a year, out of the coal duty, was granted by parliament for keeping it in repair. The revenue of the abbey, in the popi&s;h times, was near four thou&s;and pounds, equal in value now to twenty thou&s;and. It was al&s;o extremely rich in plate, jewels, and ve&s;tments. In Dort's Hi&s;tory of the Antiquities of We&s;tmin|&s;ter, we are told that it had large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in two hundreds, &s;ixteen manors, &s;eventeen hamlets, ninety-&s;even cities, towns, and villages. Queen Elizabeth, at her acce&s;&s;ion, turned out the monks and erected a college, con&s;i&s;ting of a dean, twelve prebends, and forty &s;cholars. In the ea&s;t cloi&s;ter of the abbey there is a library of about &s;ix thou|&s;and books, belonging to the dean and chapter. Seventhly, the King's &s;chool, near to the abbey-church, on the &s;outh &s;ide, at fir&s;t called the queen's &s;chool, as having been founded by queen Elizabeth, for a head-ma&s;ter, &s;econd ma&s;|ter, and forty &s;cholars. The ma&s;ters have hand|&s;ome allowances, and the &s;cholars their edu|cation, diet, and lodging, and a gown once a year. Be&s;ides tho&s;e on the foundation, great numbers of gentlemen's &s;ons are now educated here, making in the whole about four hun|dred; &s;o that there are not only the two ma&s;ters, but likewi&s;e five u&s;hers. Of tho&s;e &s;cholars that are fit for the univer&s;ity, a certain number are elected annually by the dean of Chri&s;t-church, Oxford, and the ma&s;ter of Trinity-college, Cam|bridge, alternately. In the former of the&s;e col|leges they have a competent maintenance for life, and in the latter, till they are capable of provid|ing for them&s;elves. Eighthly, We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, in which the coronation fea&s;t is kept, and the courts of Chancery, King's-bench, Common|pleas, and Exchequer are held, was fir&s;t built
<PB N="189" REF="1930">
by William Rufus, and afterwards repaired by archbi&s;hop Becket: it was repaired a &s;econd time, or rebuilt by Richard II. Though it is two hun|dred and twenty-eight feet in length, &s;ixty-&s;ix in breadth, and ninety in height, yet it has not a &s;ingle pillar in it, but is &s;upported by buttre&s;&s;es. On the ea&s;t &s;ide of the gate, are the exchequer offices, whence all the public money is received and di&s;bur&s;ed. This hall is al&s;o u&s;ed for the trial of peers and others, upon an impeachment of the commons. A great number of colours and &s;tan|dards taken from the French at the battle of Hock|&s;tet, are &s;tuck up in it. Ninthly, St. Stephen's chapel, near the &s;outh end of the hall: it belonged antiently to a college of canons, but is now the place where the hou&s;e of com|mons hold their a&s;&s;emblies, for which pur|po&s;e it has been u&s;ed ever &s;ince the di&s;&s;olution of the mona&s;teries. It is a large commodious room, with benches a&s;cending like tho&s;e in a theatre, &s;ufficient for the accommodation of &s;ix hundred gentlemen. It has al&s;o convenient apart|ments about it for &s;everal purpo&s;es; and galleries in which &s;trangers are &s;ometimes permitted to &s;it and hear the debates. Betwixt the hou&s;e of com|mons and that of lords, are the painted-chamber and court of reque&s;ts; in the former, conferences betwixt the hou&s;es are held; and in the latter, &s;uch as have bu&s;ine&s;s in either hou&s;e attend. Tenthly, the hou&s;e of lords. This is an oblong room, le&s;s than the hou&s;e of commons, and hung with fine old tape&s;try, in which is repre&s;ented the de|feat of the Spani&s;h armada. In it is a throne for the king, when he comes to the parliament, with &s;eats for the prince of Wales, and other princes of the blood royal; for the archbi&s;hops and bi&s;hops; the temporal peers, according to their ranks; for peers under age, and &s;ons of peers. The lord-chancellor,
<PB N="190" REF="1940">
keeper, and the judges, ma&s;ter of the rolls, and ma&s;ters of chancery, when pre&s;ent, &s;it on woolpacks, to put them in mind of the im|portance of the woollen manufacture to the na|tion. Eleventhly, We&s;tmin&s;ter-bridge. This is a noble bridge over the Thames, from New Pa|lace-yard We&s;tmin&s;ter, to Stangate in Surrey, begun in the year 1736, and built at the public expence, con&s;i&s;ting of thirteen arches, of which the centre one is very large. At top there is a noble &s;tone balu&s;trade on each &s;ide, with re|ce&s;&s;es, covered with half domes, at certain di&s;|tances all along. On each &s;ide is al&s;o a broad foot|path, with a road betwixt, large enough for three carriages to go a-brea&s;t. At night the bridge is well lighted by lamps placed along the balu&s;trades. The expence of erecting it amounted to above three hundred and eighty-nine thou&s;and pounds. Twelfthly, Whitehall, a magnificent palace built by cardinal Wol&s;ey, upon who&s;e death it came to the crown. It was greatly enlarged and beautified by Henry VIII. who removed hither from Bridewell, where he had re&s;ided after his pa|lace at We&s;tmin&s;ter was burnt down. The addi|tions made by Henry took up that &s;pace where are now the trea&s;ury, offices of trade and planta|tions, of one of the &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, and privy|council, be&s;ides dwelling-hou&s;es. But this palace was entirely de&s;troyed by fire in the reign of king William, &s;oon after the revolution, except the banqueting-hou&s;e, which was added by James I. and is a very noble fabric, planned by Inigo Jones. There is one very &s;tately room in it, now u&s;ed for a chapel, from one of the windows of which king Charles I. was led to the &s;caffold. The cieling of it is finely painted by Rubens. Here are kept the office of one of the &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, the board of green-cloth, and the lottery-office.
<PB N="191" REF="1950">
Before this palace was con&s;umed by fire, it was reckoned the large&s;t in the world. While Henry was carrying on his improvements, he al&s;o built St. James's, and enclo&s;ed the park of that name for the embelli&s;hment of both.</P>
<P>The pari&s;h of St. John. There is nothing re|markable in this pari&s;h, be&s;ides what hath been already mentioned, but the church, which is a very heavy building, with two porticoes, and four &s;tone towers and pinacles on the corners on the out&s;ide.</P>
<P>We proceed now to treat of the pari&s;hes in the liberties of We&s;tmin&s;ter, and &s;hall begin with that of</P>
<P>St. Martin's in the Fields. The church of this pari&s;h had its name from being &s;ituated at fir&s;t in an open field, though the neighbourhood is now one of the mo&s;t populous &s;pots in London. The pre&s;ent church is very large and beautiful, has a fine &s;teeple, &s;pire, and ring of bells, a noble organ, altar-piece, and pulpit. The portico at the we&s;t end is very grand and lofty. The whole of the church is &s;aid to have co&s;t upwards of thirty thou&s;and pounds. The pari&s;h was taken out of St. Margaret's, We&s;tmin&s;ter; and though tho&s;e of St. Paul, Covent-garden, St. Anne, St. James, and St. George, Hanover-&s;quare, have been taken out of it, yet it is &s;till very large, and the rectory one of the be&s;t in England. The other places worth mentioning in this pari&s;h are, fir&s;t, Charing-cro&s;s, &s;o called from the cro&s;s erected by Edward I. to his beloved queen Eleanor in the village that then lay about it, called Cha|ring. In place of the cro&s;s, which was almo&s;t de&s;troyed in the civil war, was erected the pre|&s;ent eque&s;trian &s;tatue of Charles I. after the re|&s;toration. Secondly, Scotland-yard, &s;o called from a palace that &s;tood here antiently, belonging to
<PB N="192" REF="1960">
the kings of Scotland, who, while they held any dominions in England, were obliged to come and do homage for them to the kings of this country. Here are now the war-office and board of works; but of the palace there are no remains. Thirdly, the admiralty-office. This is a ma&s;&s;y &s;tone &s;truc|ture, containing, be&s;ides the hall and other rooms, apartments for the &s;even lords of the admiralty, who have the whole management of the royal navy under the king. The clum&s;ine&s;s of the architecture is now happily concealed by an ele|gant &s;creen, in form of an arcade, at the en|trance, contrived by Mr. Adams, the architect. Fourthly, St. Martin's &s;chool and library. Dr. Tenni&s;on, an eminent divine, and afterwards arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury, but then only rector of this pari&s;h, erected both the&s;e in the reign of James II. Fifthly, the Mews. Here the king's hawks were once kept, but now the place &s;o called con&s;i&s;ts of two large courts, &s;eparated by a range of &s;tables, in which the king's hor&s;es &s;tand. In the courts are coach-hou&s;es and lodg|ings for the grooms, footmen, and coachmen, under the ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e. Sixthly, Marlbo|rough-hou&s;e. This is a plain brick building, be|longing to the dukes of Marlborough. It &s;tands plea&s;antly, being &s;eparated from the park only by a &s;mall garden, and on the other &s;ide from Pall|mall by a court. The apartments are elegant, well furni&s;hed, and adorned with paintings. Seventhly, Carleton-hou&s;e. Here the prince&s;s dowager of Wales, his maje&s;ty's mother, u&s;ually re&s;ides, during the winter &s;ea&s;on. It has a garden behind it, towards the park, and a large court before it, towards Pall-mall, and is now a very ele|gant and commodious man&s;ion, &s;ince its late im|provements and alterations. In the &s;ame &s;treet, a commodious hou&s;e has been built for his late royal
<PB N="193" REF="1970">
highne&s;s the duke of York, having a fine view into the park. Eighthly, St. James's palace. This palace, as we ob&s;erved before, was built by Henry VIII. Before the di&s;&s;olution it was an ho&s;pital for leprous maidens, to whom, upon their &s;urrender of it, Henry granted pen&s;ions for life. It con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal courts, and has one good range of &s;tate-rooms; though, upon the whole, it makes a very contemptible appearance as a royal palace. It has, however, a very neat chapel for the u&s;e of the royal family, which is exempted from all epi&s;copal juri&s;diction, and &s;ub|ject only to the dean, under whom, for the &s;ervice of it, are a &s;ubdean, forty-eight chaplains, twelve gentlemen of the chapel, two organi&s;ts, ten chil|dren, a &s;erjeant, a yeoman, and a groom of the ve&s;try. There is al&s;o a lord-almoner, for the di&s;tribution of his maje&s;ty's alms. In this and the queen's palace the royal family now re&s;ide during the winter. Ninthly, the Queen's-palace. This was called Buck|ingham-hou&s;e, till it was purcha&s;ed by his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty, and named the Queen's-palace. The &s;ituation is very agreeable, at the we&s;t end of St. James's-park, of which it has a full view from the front, and commands a pro&s;pect of the gardens and country behind. The gardens have been much enlarged &s;ince it was purcha&s;ed, and &s;everal im|provements and alterations made in the hou&s;e, which is adorned with &s;ome good pictures. On the &s;outh &s;ide of the gardens a &s;tately riding hou&s;e hath been built for his maje&s;ty's u&s;e. The palace it&s;elf is a plain brick building in form of an oblong &s;quare, with a flat roof, and offices on each &s;ide, joined to the body of the hou&s;e by open corri|dores, betwixt which is a large area, with a ba&s;on in the middle, and a gate of iron curiou&s;ly wrought towards the park, from which, on each &s;ide, runs a dwarf - wall, balu&s;traded a-top with iron to the
<PB N="194" REF="1980">
offices. Tenthly, the queen's library, &s;tanding in the Upper St. James's-park, near the palace, was built and furni&s;hed with books by the late queen Caroline. Eleventhly, Northumberland-hou&s;e, a noble antient palace, built round a quadrangle, with gardens and walks down to the Thames. It is very richly furni&s;hed, and adorned with many fine pictures. It belonged antiently to the Percys, earls of Northumberland; then to the duke of Somer&s;et, upon his marrying the heire&s;s of that family; and now to the duke of Northumberland, to which title, after that of earl, Sir Hugh Smith&s;on hath been advanced &s;ince his marriage with the late duke of Somer&s;et's elde&s;t daughter. Be&s;ides the&s;e places, which are the mo&s;t remarkable, there are, in this pari&s;h, &s;everal chapels, a work-hou&s;e, play-hou&s;e, tennis-court, alms-hou&s;es, cold-baths, bagnios, charity-&s;chools, a part of Leice&s;ter &s;quare, and the Hay-market.</P>
<P>St. James's-pari&s;h, which was taken out of that of St. Martin's in the Fields. The mo&s;t remarkable places in it are, fir&s;t, the church, which co&s;t &s;even thou&s;and pounds, has a lofty &s;teeple, and an arched roof, &s;upported with pillars of the Corinthian or|der, and adorned with fret - work. It was made parochial in the year 1685, &s;ince which time, as the audience is polite, and the revenue good, it hath had many eminent preachers. Secondly, St. James's-&s;quare, which is pretty large, has fine hou&s;es on all &s;ides, inhabited mo&s;tly by the nobi|lity, and is well paved, with a noble ba&s;on in the centre, &s;urrounded with a palli&s;ade. Thirdly, De|von&s;hire-hou&s;e in Piccadilly was formerly a noble hou&s;e, built by Inigo Jones, in which the prince&s;s Ann re&s;ided before her acce&s;&s;ion; but that having been burnt down in 1733, the pre&s;ent magnifi|cent hou&s;e was erected in the room of it. Fourthly, Burlington-hou&s;e is a very noble fabric, with a large area, or court, on each &s;ide of which are the offices,
<PB N="195" REF="1990">
and towards the &s;treet a high wall, having three gates, two le&s;&s;er ones at each end, and a grand en|trance in the middle. Fifthly, Berkeley-&s;quare, containing three acres, has been lately laid out and enclo&s;ed with iron rails in an elegant ta&s;te, and is &s;urrounded with hand&s;ome hou&s;es; particularly, on the &s;outh-&s;ide, there is a mo&s;t magnificient man|&s;ion belonging to lord Shelburne. Sixthly, At the bottom of the Hay-market on the we&s;t-&s;ide is the Opera-hou&s;e; and on the other &s;ide of the &s;treet a little theatre, well contrived and deco|rated for the repre&s;entation of dramatic entertain|ments. There are a great number of elegant hou&s;es in this pari&s;h belonging to per&s;ons of di&s;tinc|tion, and &s;everal charity-&s;chools, meeting-hou&s;es, markets, and chapels of ea&s;e.</P>
<P>St. George's, Hanover-&s;quare. In this pari&s;h, be&s;ides the church, a &s;tately edifice, and one of the fifty new churches, the mo&s;t remarkable places are the following: fir&s;t, Hanover &s;quare, which, tho' not very large, is agreeable, having hand&s;ome hou&s;es all round, and an area of about two acres laid out in near gravel walks. Secondly, Caven|di&s;h-&s;quare, adorned with a number of elegant hou&s;es, near which is a hand&s;ome chapel erected by the duke of Portland. Thirdly, Gro&s;venor-&s;quare, having an area of five acres, in which is a plea&s;ant garden, with an eque&s;trian &s;tatue of king George I. finely gilt in the centre. In this pari&s;h are al&s;o the infirmary at Hyde-park corner, &s;everal chapels of ea&s;e, a work-hou&s;e, a charity-&s;chool, and a market.</P>
<P>St. A$n's, We&s;tmin&s;ter. In this pari&s;h are Soho and a part of Leice&s;ter-&s;quares. The former is well built, and has beautiful walks railed in, and planted with trees; in the mid&s;t of which is a fountain, and a &s;tatue of Charles II in armour. The latter takes up between two and three acres, the greate&s;t part of which is inclo&s;ed, and laid out in plea&s;ant walks, with an eque&s;trian &s;tatue of
<PB N="196" REF="2000">
George II. gilt, in the centre. On the north &s;ide is Leice&s;ter-hou&s;e, the re&s;idence of his pre&s;ent ma|je&s;ty when prince of Wales. In this pari&s;h live more French refugees, or their de&s;cendants, than in any other in England.</P>
<P>St. Paul's, Covent-Garden. That &s;pace now called Covent or Common-Garden was antiently a real garden belonging to the monks of We&s;t|min&s;ter, and for that rea&s;on called Convent-Gar|den. In 1552 it was given by Edward VI. to John, earl of Bedford, one of who&s;e de&s;cendants built the church for the u&s;e of his tenants, which in 1645 was made parochial. It was de&s;igned by Inigo Jones, and tho' plain, is accounted elegant, having a noble portico on the ea&s;t &s;ide, where the poll is taken for members for the city and liberty of We&s;tmin&s;ter. The &s;quare, on the we&s;t &s;ide of which the church &s;tands, has a column in the middle, with &s;un-dials on all &s;ides at the top, &s;tately hou&s;es with arcades on the north and ea&s;t, a fine play-hou&s;e in the north-ea&s;t corner, and in the area is kept a market, the be&s;t in Eng|land, for all kinds of fruit, garden &s;tuff, and green and dried herbs.</P>
<P>St. Mary le Strand, one of the fifty new churches, is not large, but very beautiful, tho' rather over|charged with &s;culpture. On the we&s;t is a &s;tately portico, with a dome, &s;upported by &s;everal pillars. The pari&s;h, before the erection of the church, was in the precinct of the Savoy. The mo&s;t remark|able buildings are, fir&s;t, Somer&s;et-hou&s;e, a palace built by the duke of Somer&s;et, uncle to Edward VI. which con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal courts, and, no doubt, was a magnificent &s;tructure for the times in which it was built, but makes no grand appearance now. Charles II. made a noble addition to it, which, with the back parts of the palace, command a beautiful view of the gardens and river. The gar|dens are adorned with &s;hady-walks, and there are
<PB N="197" REF="2010">
&s;ome &s;tatues both in it and about the hou&s;e. As none of the royal family have re&s;ided here for a long time, officers belonging to the court, and others, are permitted to lodge in it. Secondly, the Savoy, which was antiently a hou&s;e built by Peter earl of Savoy, from whom it derived its name. Afterwards there was a magnificent palace, be|longing to the dukes of Lanca&s;ter, which was de&s;troyed by Wat Tyler and his Kenti&s;h rebels. Henry VII. built and endowed an ho&s;pital in place of it, which Edward VI. &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and gave the greater part of its revenues to his ho&s;pitals of Bride|well, St. Thomas, and Chri&s;t-church: but queen Mary revived the former e&s;tabli&s;hment, which was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed once more by queen Elizabeth, and the revenue re&s;tored to the ho&s;pitals. Here are now a great many private hou&s;es, a pri&s;on for de&s;erters and other offenders, barracks for the guards and recruits, and chapels for the French and German prote&s;tants. It is a liberty of it&s;elf, independent of the dean and chapter of We&s;t|min&s;ter, or rather a part of that now called the Dutchy Liberty, extending from Temple-Bar to Cecil-&s;treet in the Strand.</P>
<P>St. Clement's-Danes is &s;aid to have had the epi|thet of Danes from a church, or caemetery, that antiently &s;tood in it belonging to that nation. The church is one of the mo&s;t beautiful in town, was de&s;igned by Sir Chri&s;topher Wren, and built at the expence of the pari&s;hioners in 1682. The mo&s;t noted places in the pari&s;h are, fir&s;t, Clement's|inn, which has its name from the church, and is one of the inns of Chancery belonging to the Inner-Temple: it con&s;i&s;ts of a hall and &s;everal courts. Secondly, New-inn, belonging to the Mid|dle-Temple, has a hand&s;ome little garden, and is well built. Thirdly, Lyon's-inn, which belongs to the Inner-Temple, and has been long in the
<PB N="198" REF="2020">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the practitioners of the law. Fourth|ly, Exeter-Exchange is a large building oppo&s;ite the Savoy, where Exeter-hou&s;e formerly &s;tood. The upper floor is occupied chiefly as a ware|hou&s;e, and the lower, formerly by milliners, but now by glovers, dealers in toys, books, mu&s;ical in&s;truments, and prints. Fifthly, Clare-market, which had its name from the Newca&s;tle family, its proprietors, and is well &s;upplied with provi&s;ions of all &s;orts.</P>
<P>St. Martin's le Grand, tho' in the heart of the city of London, is, as we ob&s;erved above, &s;ub|ject to that of We&s;tmin&s;ter, the deputy-&s;teward of which holds a court in it weekly, and for who&s;e members the inhabitants of the precinct vote.</P>
<P>We now proceed to de&s;cribe the mo&s;t remarkable places in the &s;everal pari&s;hes in the &s;uburbs and without the liberties both of London and We&s;t|min&s;ter, taking them as they lie from we&s;t to ea&s;t.</P>
<P>St. Giles in the Fields. In antient times here was an ho&s;pital for lepers, founded by Maud, wife to Henry I. where, it is &s;aid, the pri&s;oners going to Tyburn were pre&s;ented with a bowl of ale, to refre&s;h them before they were executed. The pre&s;ent church was built betwixt the years 1730 and 1734. The pari&s;h was very large, till St. George's Bloom&s;bury was taken out of it. It &s;till contains one of the large&s;t and hand&s;ome&s;t &s;quares in Europe, namely, Lincoln's-inn fields, in which the hou&s;es are very fine, e&s;pecially on the we&s;t &s;ide, and the area has a large ba&s;on of water in the centre, and is &s;urrounded with an iron palli&s;ade on a dwarf-wall.</P>
<P>St. George's, Bloom&s;bury, was taken out of the pari&s;h of St. Giles, and its church, which &s;tands &s;outh and north, and has the figure of George I. at the top of its lofty &s;pire, is one of the fifty new ones. Here was antiently a village called Bloom&s;bury,
<PB N="199" REF="2030">
from which the pari&s;h and &s;quare derive their names. The &s;quare contains about three acres, and is very beautiful. In this pari&s;h is that mag|nificent palace called Montague-hou&s;e, which be|longed to the late duke of Montague, but has been lately purcha&s;ed by the parliament for a re|po&s;itory of the Cottonian library, Harlean manu|&s;cripts, major Edward's library, and Sir Hans Sloane's immen&s;e and curious collection of books, manu&s;cripts, and rarities, which are now the pro|perty of the public, and called the Briti&s;h Mu|&s;eum. In con&s;ideration of its great utility, his maje&s;ty has al&s;o been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to add thereto the libraries of books and manu&s;cripts collected by the &s;everal kings of England. Sir Hans Sloane's collection co&s;t twenty thou&s;and pounds, lord Oxford's manu&s;cripts ten thou&s;and pounds, the hou&s;e and gardens ten thou&s;and pounds, and all other conveniences for placing the whole fifteen thou&s;and pounds, be&s;ides a large &s;um placed in the funds to &s;upply &s;alaries for the officers, &amp;c. A catalogue of this noble Mu|&s;eum is written in thirty-eight volumes in folio and eight in quarto. Rules and &s;tatutes al&s;o, with re&s;pect to the u&s;e of it, have been drawn up by the tru&s;tees, and printed. A little to the ea&s;t of the Mu&s;eum is Bedford-hou&s;e, a very elegant &s;pacious &s;tructure, with its front to|wards the &s;quare, from which it is &s;eparated by a noble wall and gates, inclo&s;ing a fine area. Be|hind it has a beautiful garden, and a pro&s;pect of the fields. In this pari&s;h there is al&s;o a hand&s;ome mar|ket, rebuilt &s;ome years ago by the duke of Bedford.</P>
<P>St. George's, Queen-&s;quare, was taken out of St. Andrew's, Holbourn, and its church is ano|ther of the fifty new ones. The mo&s;t remarkable places in it are, fir&s;t, its &s;quare, which is a very fine one, but open on the north to the fields.
<PB N="200" REF="2040">
&s;econdly, the ho&s;pital in Lamb's Conduit fields, for the maintenance of expo&s;ed and de&s;erted young children, called the Foundling-ho&s;pital, which is a very large and magnificent &s;tructure. In this ho&s;pital a great number of expo&s;ed and de&s;erted children are maintained and in&s;tructed; the boys being fitted for agriculture and the &s;ea-&s;ervice, and the girls for u&s;eful &s;ervants for &s;uch proper per&s;ons as may apply for them. By act of parlia|ment, the males are not to continue in the hou&s;e after they have attained the age of twenty-four, nor the females after twenty-one. Such as have not had the &s;mall-pox are inoculated at three years of age, in a proper place out of the ho&s;pital. For &s;ome time all were admitted that were brought, not exceeding two months old; but now only &s;uch as draw white balls. Thirdly, Powis-hou&s;e, in Or|mond-&s;treet, had its name from the la&s;t duke of Powis, by whom both it and the late duke of New|ca&s;tle's hou&s;e in Lincoln's-inn-fields were built; but the pre&s;ent &s;tructure is &s;aid to have been erected at the expence of Lewis XIV. of France, the former having been burnt down while his am|ba&s;&s;ador re&s;ided in it. Fourthly, Red-lion-&s;quare, which is &s;mall, but very neat, with an obeli&s;k in the centre. Be&s;ides the&s;e places, in this neigh|bourhood are two conduits, called the Devil's and Lambs Conduits; the former of which &s;upplies Chri&s;t's-ho&s;pital with water, St. John's-church, as it is called, tho' it is no more than a chapel of ea&s;e to St. Andrew's Holborn, and the two great inns of court called Gray's and Lincoln's-inns.</P>
<P>Gray's-inn is in the pari&s;h of St. Andrew's Hol|born, but not within the liberties of the city, and therefore was not mentioned in our de&s;crip|tion of the mo&s;t remarkable places in it. It an|tiently belonged to the family of the Grays of Wilton, whence it had its name; afterwards
<PB N="201" REF="2050">
to the &s;tudents of the law, and &s;ince then to the monks of Shene near Richmond, who lea&s;ed it to the &s;ociety for a &s;mall rent, which has been paid to the crown &s;ince the di&s;&s;olution, when Henry VIII. granted it in fee-farm to the &s;ociety upon that condition. It con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal courts, inhabited by barri&s;ters and &s;tudents of the law, and al&s;o by &s;uch gentlemen of independent fortunes, as chu&s;e this place for the &s;ake of an agreeeable re|tirement, or the plea&s;ure of the walks, which is likewi&s;e the ca&s;e of mo&s;t of the other inns of court. Here is a large hall, a chapel, and a library, well furni&s;hed with law and other books. Behind it is a very noble garden, with gravel and terras|walks, well planted and &s;haded with trees. The &s;ociety can boa&s;t of having in the li&s;t of its mem|bers tho&s;e two eminent men, Sir Nicholas Bacon, lord-keeper of the great-&s;eal, and Sir Francis, lord Verulam, and lord-high-chancellor of Eng|land; the latter of whom was more elevated above other men by his genius, learning, and know|ledge of nature, than by his rank and office. The members of the hou&s;e are to be in commons a fortnight every term, for which they pay &s;ixteen &s;hillings. The other great inn, viz. Lincoln's, is partly in the pari&s;h of St. Giles's, partly in that of St. Clement's, and partly in the liberty of the Rolls. It is very large, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal courts, which have been erected at different periods of time. The chapel is very beautiful, and much admired for its painted windows. On the north|&s;ide are gardens, in which is a fine terras extend|ing the whole length of the garden, and com|manding a pro&s;pect of Lincoln's-inn fields, be&s;ides walks &s;haded with trees, and embelli&s;hed with fountains and &s;tatues. The charge of admi&s;&s;ion into this hou&s;e, including fees, amounts to five pounds, and every &s;tudent after &s;tudying there
<PB N="202" REF="2060">
&s;even years, is admitted to the bar. The mem|bers are obliged to be a fortnight in commons every term.</P>
<P>St. James's, Clerkenwell. The church of this pari&s;h is part of one that belonged to a priory which &s;tood here antiently. It had the epithet of Clerkenwell from the pari&s;h clerks of London coming hither formerly, once a-year, to repre&s;ent portions of &s;cripture, in the dramatic way, before the lord-mayor, aldermen, and &s;ome of the nobi|lity, at a noted fountain near the lower end of the green. Near this, where now is St. John's-&s;quare, was formerly an ho&s;pital belonging to the knights of St. John of Jeru&s;alem, or Knights-Ho&s;pitallers, &s;o called from their having an ho&s;pital at Jeru&s;alem for the accommodation of pilgrims, and other Chri&s;tians. This was their chief &s;eat in England. Both they, and the Knights-Templars, tho' ori|ginally poor and humble, flouri&s;hed to &s;uch a degree, that the former had nineteen thou&s;and lord&s;hips in Chri&s;tendom, and the latter nine thou&s;and; the prior of the former being reckoned the fir&s;t baron of Eng|land. The yearly revenues of their ho&s;pitals at the di&s;&s;olution amounted to three thou&s;and four hun|dred pounds; a &s;um equal to five times as much now. In this pari&s;h is Hicks's-hall, which had its name from Sir Bapti&s;t Hicks, a mercer and ju&s;tice of the peace, who built it at his own expence, and in which are held the &s;e&s;&s;ions of the ju&s;tices of the peace for Middle&s;ex. Here al&s;o the grand-jury meet eight times a-year, to find the bills of indict|ment on which criminals are afterwards tried at the Old-Bailey. As the water-works of the New-River company are in this pari&s;h, it will not be improper to give a brief account of that great undertaking, for &s;upplying the city with good and whole&s;ome water. It was fir&s;t &s;et on foot by the citizens of London in the reign of James I. but
<PB N="203" REF="2070">
they growing weary of it, in con&s;equence of the expence, it was next undertaken by Sir Hugh Middleton, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the king, who cut a canal, from Ware to I&s;lington, for forty miles, bringing it over vallies in &s;ome places, and thro' mountains in others. King Charles I. relinqui&s;hed his moiety to Sir Hugh, upon condition that five hundred pounds a-year, fee-farm rent, &s;hould be paid out of the future profits to the crown. The &s;tock and profits were divided into &s;eventy-two &s;hares, each of which is valued at above five thou&s;and guineas, the number of hou&s;es &s;upplied by it with water being now very great, and continually increa&s;ing. The proprietors were incorporated by James I. and the affairs of the company are managed by a governor, deputy-governor, trea&s;urer, and twen|ty-&s;ix directors, who have under them &s;everal clerks, collectors, paviours, turncocks, pipe-borers, be&s;ides &s;urveyors to &s;ee the river &s;coured once a-year, and fourteen walkers between Ware and London, to &s;ee that no damage be done to it, nor any thing thrown in to infect the water. Be|&s;ides the great plea&s;ure, convenience, health, and cleanline&s;s private families derive from this un|dertaking, the advantage of a &s;upply of water in every &s;treet, for extingui&s;hing fires, is apparent to every one. Likewi&s;e in this pari&s;h is the noble ho&s;pital, called the Charter-hou&s;e, becau&s;e it was antiently a mona&s;tery belonging to the Chartreux, or Carthu&s;ians. After the di&s;&s;olution, it pa&s;&s;ed thro' &s;everal hands, till at la&s;t in the reign of James I. it was purcha&s;ed of the earl of Suffolk by Thomas Sutton, of Ca&s;tle-Camps, in the coun|ty of Cambridge, who converted it into an ho&s;|pital, which he liberally endowed, for the main|tenance of eighty poor brothers, who are to be decayed gentlemen or merchants, or &s;uperannuated &s;oldiers by &s;ea or land, not under fifty years of

age; but &s;oldiers maimed in the wars may, in regard of their misfortune, be admitted ten years &s;ooner. All the&s;e, be&s;ides a gown each, diet, and lodging, are allowed &s;even pounds a-year. He further endowed it for the maintenance and education of forty boys, now increa&s;ed to forty-four, in con&s;equence of the improvement of the rents. The&s;e are admitted between the years of ten and fifteen, and continue in the ho&s;pital eight; at the expiration of which, tho&s;e that have a capa|city for learning are tran&s;planted to the univer&s;ities, where twenty nine now are con&s;tantly maintained, with an allowance of twenty pounds per annum for eight years, after which many of them are provided for in the church, there being nine livings in the gift of the governors, to which they have the preference. Tho&s;e of a le&s;s promi&s;ing genius in cla&s;&s;ical learning are put out appren|tices, and the hou&s;e gives forty pounds with each. The governors are the king, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, two bi&s;hops, twelve noblemen, of whom the king pre&s;ents two both of the pen|&s;ioners and &s;cholars, and the re&s;t one each in their turns. Under the&s;e are a ma&s;ter or governor, a preacher, two &s;choolma&s;ters, a phy&s;ician, regi&s;|ter, receiver, trea&s;urer, manciple, &s;teward, and auditor, liberally provided for in the hou&s;e. The purcha&s;e of the hou&s;e co&s;t Mr. Sutton thirteen thou&s;and pounds; the building and fitting up of the ho&s;pital &s;even thou&s;and pounds more; and the rents of the fifteen manors, and other lands, with which he endowed it, amounted at fir&s;t to four thou&s;and five hundred pounds, and now to upwards of &s;ix thou&s;and pounds per annum. He lies bu|ried in the chapel under a magnificent monument of white and black marble, which co&s;t fifteen hun|dred pounds. Be&s;ides the money and e&s;tates ex|pended upon, and left to the ho&s;pital, he be|queathed

fifteen thou&s;and pounds in legacies to his relations and friends.</P>
<P>St. Luke's pari&s;h was taken out of St. Giles's Cripplegate, and the church is one of the fifty new ones. The places worth our no|tice in it are the&s;e; fir&s;t, the Artillery-ground. This is a field to the north of Chi&s;well-&s;treet, for the Artillery company, and trained bands of Lon|don to perform their exerci&s;es in, with a building in the middle for a magazine of arms. Secondly, Old-&s;treet, a part of the Roman military way, that went by London from the we&s;t to the ea&s;tern part of the kingdom. Thirdly, Tindal's, or the Di&s;&s;enters burying ground, &s;o called be|cau&s;e one Tindal took a lea&s;e of the ground, and converted it into a burial-place for the di&s;&s;enters. Fourth, Mountmill, at the end of Go&s;well-&s;treet, was one of the forts erected by the parlia|ment in 1643, for the defence of London. It was afterwards called the Mount, and upon a wind-mill being erected upon it, Mount-mill. Fifth, Playhou&s;e-yard, between Whitecro&s;s-&s;treet and Golden-lane. Here was antiently a play-hou&s;e, and, as it appears, another in Barbican; nor is this to be wondered at, as many of the no|bility formerly lived hereabouts. By the pe&s;t-hou&s;e, in this pari&s;h, is an ho&s;pital in which above two hundred poor French prote&s;tants are main|tained, one half of them and more by the revenue of the hou&s;e, and the re&s;t by their friends at nine pounds a year each: the governors of it are in|corporated. Near this is St. Luke's ho&s;pital for lunatics, which we have mentioned before. In this pari&s;h are al&s;o &s;everal alms hou&s;es, a free|&s;chool, the city common-hunt hou&s;e, and a ken|nel for hounds.</P>
<P>St. Leonard's Shoreditch. This is a very large pari&s;h, which took its name, not from Jane Shore,
<PB N="206" REF="2100">
concubine to Edward IV. but from Sir John Sord, or Soreditch, lord of the manor in the reign of Edward III. The foundation of the pre&s;ent church, which is very beautiful, and has a very lofty &s;teeple, was laid in the year 1736. The places of chief note in the pari&s;h are the&s;e; fir&s;t, A&s;ke's ho&s;pital, in the hamlet of Hoxton, built by the company of haberda&s;hers, execu|tors of Robert A&s;ke, e&s;quire, one of their mem|bers, who left them thirty thou&s;and pounds for that purpo&s;e, and for the relief of twenty poor men, members of the company, who mu&s;t be &s;ingle, and have each three pounds a year, lodg|ing, firing, diet, and a gown once in two years. He further ordained, that twenty boys, the &s;ons of decayed freemen of the company, &s;hould be educated and maintained. Their ma&s;ter has forty pounds and a hou&s;e, and reads prayers twice a day. The building, which has more the air of a palace than an alms-hou&s;e, co&s;t twelve thou&s;and pounds. Secondly, Ironmongers-ho&s;pital, or Jef|fries alms-hou&s;es. This ho&s;pital &s;tands in King&s;|land road, a little out of town, and is an excellent model for an alms hou&s;e, being only two &s;tories high, of brick, without ornament, but neat, and the chapel in the middle. In it, erected by the ironmongers in 1713, pur&s;uant to the will of Sir Robert Jeffries, who was a member of that com|pany, and lord-mayor of London, fifty-&s;ix poor men of the &s;ame company, not under fifty-&s;ix years of age, have a room, part of a cellar, &s;ix pounds a year, and a gown. If any of them have a wife, &s;he may live with him, and if &s;he &s;urvives him, be cho&s;en in his room. Thirdly, the Weavers-alms-hou&s;es in Old-&s;treet, in which twelve weavers wi|dows have each twenty-four bu&s;hels of coals, twenty &s;hillings a year, and a gown every &s;e|cond year. Fourthly, Fuller's alms-hou&s;es,
<PB N="207" REF="2110">
in which twelve poor widows of Shoreditch pari&s;h have four pounds a year and a &s;ack of coals. Fifthly, Walter's alms hou&s;es in the &s;ame &s;treet. In the&s;e, eight poor widows have five &s;hillings a month each, and half a chaldron of coals yearly. Sixthly, Badger's alms-hou&s;es at Hox|ton, in which &s;ix poor men have twenty &s;hillings a year for them&s;elves and wives. Seventhly, Burn's alms-hou&s;es in King&s;land-road, con&s;i&s;ting of twelve rooms, in each of which a poor freeman of the frame-work-knitters company, or his widow, has his proportion of eighty pounds a year. Har|war's alms-hou&s;es in the &s;ame road, in which twelve &s;ingle men and women, put in one half by the drapers company, and the other by the pari&s;h of Shoreditch, have &s;ix &s;hillings a month, and half a chaldron of coals each yearly. In Norton-Falgate liberty, which belongs to the dean and chapter of St. Paul's, and lies between Bi|&s;hop&s;gate-&s;treet-bars and Shoreditch, is an alms-hou&s;e, in which &s;ix poor members of the weavers company, have each eight pounds, a chaldron of coals, and a dozen and half of candles yearly.</P>
<P>The pari&s;h of Chri&s;t-church, Spitalfields. The church is one of the fifty new ones, and is reckoned one of the mo&s;t magnificent pari&s;h churches in Lon|don. The inhabitants, of which the greater part are French, or of French extraction, are employed chiefly in the &s;ilk manufacture. The pari&s;h was taken out of St. Dun&s;tan's Stepney. From the urns with a&s;hes, human bones, and other Roman antiquities, that have been dug up here, the&s;e fields would &s;eem to have been a burial-place of the Romans. They were afterwards called Lolle&s;|worth-fields, as we learn from Stow, and after that Spitalfields, from St. Mary's Spital, in the neighbourhood. The French have a charity|&s;chool in the&s;e fields, in which all the poor chil|dren
<PB N="208" REF="2120">
of that nation are taught to read, write, and cypher gratis, at certain hours of the day, and two alms-hou&s;es, in one of which near three hun|dred poor families have a pan of broth, half a pound of meat, and a pound of bread, from two to &s;ix times a week, according to their circum|&s;tances; the charity requires five hundred a year to &s;upport it. In the other, forty-five poor men and women have two &s;hillings and three pence, and a bu&s;hel of coals a week, and apparel every other year. In an alms-hou&s;e belonging to the dyers, near Spitalfields, &s;ix poor widows have thirty &s;hillings a year.</P>
<P>St. Mary's Whitechapel. The church of this pari&s;h was &s;o called, as it is thought, from its be|ing formerly a chapel of ea&s;e to Stepney, and the whitene&s;s of its walls. In Wellclo&s;e, or Marine &s;quare, in this pari&s;h, is the Dani&s;h chapel, and in Ro&s;emary-lane is Rag-fair, in which old cloaths, to a great amount, are bought and &s;old. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there is a market for hay, and carca&s;es of &s;heep; and not many ago was a playhou&s;e in Goodman's-fields, for the amu&s;ement of the inha|bitants of Wapping and its environs. To con|clude, there are al&s;o two free-&s;chools, two alms-hou&s;es, a court of record, a pri&s;on, work-hou&s;e, and cold bath.</P>
<P>St. Catharine's by the Tower. This pari&s;h is chiefly remarkable for an ho&s;pital and chantry founded in the popi&s;h times with great privileges and immunities; the former by Maud, wife of king Stephen, but endowed and augmented by Eleanor, relict of Henry III. and Eleanor, wife of Edward I. for a ma&s;ter, three brethren, chap|lains, &s;ix poor clerks, and ten poor women; the latter by Philippa, wife to Edward III. The ma&s;ter delivered up the charter to queen Eliza|beth, to be cancelled; but &s;he granted them an|other,
<PB N="209" REF="2130">
by which mo&s;t of their privileges and re|venues were continued to them. In con&s;equence of this there is &s;till a ma&s;ter, but he is not an eccle|&s;ia&s;tic as formerly; three brethren, u&s;ually &s;ome eminent clergymen, who preach by turns; three &s;i&s;ters, and ten bead&s;women, among whom the endowment is divided. The precinct is &s;till a di&s;|tinct liberty, having its proper judge, court, and pri&s;on; and without an order from the board of Green-cloth, no per&s;on can be arre&s;ted in it. The church is &s;ubject to the bi&s;hop of London. In this pari&s;h is a place called Hangman's-gains, which is a &s;trange corruption of Hammes and Gui&s;nes, the names of two towns in Picardy, whence, upon their being taken by the French, many of the inhabitants came and &s;ettled here.</P>
<P>St. John's, Wapping, was taken out of St. Mary's, White-chapel. It is inhabited chiefly by &s;ea-faring people, or &s;uch as deal in naval &s;tores. It can claim a third of all the gifts and legacies left to St. Mary's, White-chapel, and al&s;o of the rents of the hou&s;es belonging to that pari&s;h, with a &s;ixth of the money collected at the &s;acrament. In this pari&s;h is Execution-dock, where pirates are executed, another dock, and a yard for &s;hip|building.</P>
<P>St. Paul's, Shadwell, was taken out of Stepney, deriving its name from a &s;pring under the &s;outh-wall of the church. In Sun-tavern-fields, where gra|vel, which is now taken out of the river, u&s;ed formerly to be dug for balla&s;t, and conveyed thro' the lanes, &s;till from thence called Old and New-gravel-lanes, coffins and urns, &amp;c. were found in 1615: whence, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, there was for|merly a Roman caemetery. In this pari&s;h is al&s;o a medicinal-&s;pring, and a dock for building &s;hips.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="2140">
St. George's in the Ea&s;t is one of the fifty new churches, and the pari&s;h was formerly a part of that of Stepney. The mo&s;t remarkable founda|tion in it is Raine's ho&s;pital in Fowden-fields. Forty-eight girls, taken out of the pari&s;h-&s;chool, which was al&s;o endowed by Mr. Raine with a per|petual annuity of &s;ixty pounds, are taught to read, write, &s;ew, and hou&s;ewifry, and after being three years upon the foundation, are put out appren|tices. For the&s;e purpo&s;es he endowed the ho&s;pital with a perpetual annuity of two hundred and forty pounds, be&s;ides four thou&s;and four hundred pounds South-&s;ea annuities, to be laid out in a purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>St. Ann's, Limehou&s;e, is one of the fifty new churches, &s;aid to have had its name from the limes that formerly grew thereabouts. In the pari&s;h are two docks for &s;hip-building; and the inhabitants, both of it and the two la&s;t mentioned pari&s;hes, are chiefly &s;ea-faring people and their dependants.</P>
<P>St. Dun&s;tan's, Stepney. Tho' &s;everal pari&s;hes, as we have already ob&s;erved, have been taken out of this, it is &s;till very large, and contains mo&s;t of the Tower-hamlets, viz. Bednal-green, Mile-end, Poplar, and Ratcliff, be&s;ides the village of Step|ney. There are none of the&s;e without one or two alms-hou&s;es; but at Mile-end are many, as the drapers, &s;kinners, vintners, judge Fuller's, Fi&s;h|er's, Bancroft's, and the Trinity-hou&s;e; of which, the two la&s;t merit a more particular de&s;cription. In Bancroft's alms-hou&s;e, which was erected in 1735 by the drapers company, in pur&s;uance of the will of Francis Bancroft, who had been one of the lord-mayor's officers, and left twenty-&s;even thou|&s;and pounds in tru&s;t to the above company, for building and endowing it, twenty-four poor alms|men have eight pounds a-piece, and half a chal|dron of coals yearly, with a gown of bays every
<PB N="211" REF="2150">
third year; and one hundred poor boys are cloath|ed and taught, with four pounds to bind them ap|prentices; but if they go to &s;ervice, they have only two pounds ten &s;hillings to buy cloaths. The two &s;chool-ma&s;ters have thirty pounds a year and a hou&s;e each: be&s;ides what is allowed for books, paper, pens, and ink, twenty pounds a-year are allotted to &s;upply the ma&s;ter and &s;chool with coals and candles. Both alms-men and boys are obliged to be pre&s;ent at two &s;ermons, for which he left money, to be preached at St. Helen's or St. Michael's, Cornhill. Trinity-ho&s;pital, a very beautiful building, was erected in 1695 by the corporation of the Trinity, con&s;i&s;ting of a ma&s;ter, four wardens, eight a&s;&s;i&s;tants, eighteen elder brethren, and an unlimited number of younger brethren, for twenty-eight decayed or antient &s;eamen, or their widows, who have &s;ixteen &s;hil|lings every month, twenty &s;hillings a-year for coals, and a gown every &s;econd year. Be&s;ides this, ari&s;ing from the money of the balla&s;t-office, light-hou&s;es, buoys, beacons, &amp;c. belonging to them by act of parliament, the benefactions of well di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons, e&s;tates purcha&s;ed or received, they an|nually afford relief to at lea&s;t three thou&s;and poor mariners, their widows, or orphans. They had their fir&s;t charter from Henry VIII. which has been &s;everal times confirmed and extended &s;ince. Their powers and privileges are, 1&s;t, To examine the ma&s;ters of his maje&s;ty's &s;hips. 2d, To lay five pounds fine upon aliens who &s;erve aboard mer|chants &s;hips without their licen&s;e, and to puni&s;h &s;eamen for mutiny and de&s;ertion in the merchants &s;ervice. 3d, To appoint pilots for conducting &s;hips in and out of the Thames, and to lay fifty pounds fine upon them and the ma&s;ters, who act without being authorized by them. 4th, To &s;et|tle the rates of pilotage, and erect light-hou&s;es and

&s;ea-marks on the coa&s;t. 5th, To licen&s;e poor &s;ea|men, not freemen, to row on the Thames for their &s;upport, when their &s;ervice is not wanted at &s;ea. 6th, To hear and determine the complaints of officers and &s;eamen in the merchants &s;ervice; but an appeal lies from their decrees to the court of admiralty. 7th, In con&s;ideration of the increa&s;e of their poor, to purcha&s;e e&s;tates in mortmain to the amount of five hundred pounds, and to receive the benefactions of well di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons to the like amount clear of reprizes. Every ma&s;ter or mate, who is expert in navigation, may be ad|mitted into the fraternity as a younger brother. The hamlet of Poplar in this pari&s;h is &s;o called from the trees of that kind, with which it formerly abounded. That called Poplar-mar&s;h, or the I&s;le of Dogs, from the hounds kept in it when the court re&s;ided at Greenwich, is reckoned the riche&s;t pa&s;ture in England, and the &s;heep and cattle fed there the large&s;t. It is not in reality an i&s;land, but a penin&s;ula, being joined to the land on the north-&s;ide. Blackwall, in this pari&s;h, contains &s;everal yards and docks, and a &s;afe harbour for the large&s;t &s;hips. Ratcliff is &s;aid to take its name from a red cliff that was antiently there. In this pari&s;h is a German and Portugue&s;e-Jews burial-ground, and an annual fair at Mile end. In each of the hamlets is a chapel of ea&s;e to the mother-church at Stepney, and di&s;&s;enters meeting-hou&s;es all over the pari&s;h.</P>
<P>St. John's, Hackney, contains, be&s;ides the village properly called Hackney, the hamlets of Dal&s;ton and Shakelwell on the we&s;t, Clapton on the north, and Hummerton on the ea&s;t, which are inhabited mo&s;tly by merchants and citizens of London.</P>

Holloways, three &s;ides of Newington-Green, and part of King&s;land, The church, which was not many years ago rebuilt, is a prebend of St. Paul's, but &s;ubject in eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters to the archdeacon of London. In this pari&s;h is Canonbury-hou&s;e, on a beautiful eminence, once the man&s;ion-hou&s;e of a manor belonging to the canons of St. Bartho|lomew, in Smithfield, but now divided into tene|ments, and let out, many people from London taking lodgings in it, on account of its fine &s;itua|tion, air, and pro&s;pect. On the we&s;t &s;ide of I&s;ling|ton is that noble re&s;ervoir, whence the water, con|veyed by the channel already mentioned from Ware in Hertford&s;hire, is received, and from which, and another re&s;ervoir a little higher, it is di&s;tributed by pipes all over the town. In a field beyond the White-conduit-hou&s;e, called Six-acre-field, are the remains of a Roman camp, &s;uppo&s;ed to be made by the Roman general Suetonius, after he quitted London, and before he defeated the Britons un|der Boadicea. Near I&s;lington al&s;o is a &s;pring of chalybeate-water, called New Tunbridge-wells, for drinking of which each per&s;on pays three-pence; and a hou&s;e of entertainment, called Sadler's-wells, where during the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on people are amu&s;ed with rope-dancing, tumbling, pantomime enter|tainments, &amp;c.</P>

<P>St. Mary-le-Bonne, or rather Borne, took its name from a church built here in the fifteenth century, in place of one at Tyburn, and dedicated to the Virgin-Mary, with the epither of Borne, from a bourn or brook near it. The city was for|merly
<PB N="214" REF="2180">
&s;upplied with water from this brook by nine conduits; but in 1703, when it was plentifully &s;upplied with better from the New-River, this was demi&s;ed for &s;even hundred pounds a-year, for the term of forty-three years. Over the ci&s;terns, at the foot of the bridge, was formerly a banquet-hou&s;e, in which the lord-mayor and aldermen, and their ladies, u&s;ed to have entertainments; but it was taken down in 1737. Tho' antiently there was a manor, village, and church, that bore the name of Tyburn, yet the only place that retains it at pre&s;ent is the &s;pot where the felons are exe|cuted. This village is now almo&s;t joined to the metropolis, by the new buildings on that &s;ide. Here is a place of public entertainment, with a plea&s;ant garden, and a band of vocal and in&s;tru|mental mu&s;ic, in imitation of Vauxhall. At a little di&s;tance, towards the north, lies Paddington, a pretty little rural village.</P>
<P>Hamp&s;tead, a village, lying to the north-ea&s;t of the former, upon the brow of a hill, whence there is a mo&s;t delightful pro&s;pect of London, the Thames, and the country along its banks on both &s;ides. The heath has &s;omething very wild and agreeable. Here is a fine a&s;&s;embly and long-room; and not many years ago a very hand&s;ome chapel was erected by the contributions of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>Highgate. This village has its name from an high gate, where toll was paid to the bi&s;hop of London, when the road from Gray's-inn to Bar|net was turned thro' his lands. In the neighbour|ing pari&s;h of Horn&s;ey, to which, and that of Pancras, the church of Highgate is only a chapel of ea&s;e, at a place called Mu&s;well-hill, from a well there, was a chapel in the popi&s;h times, &s;tiled Our Lady of Mu&s;well, much vi&s;ited by the &s;uper|&s;titious, in con&s;equence of &s;ome miraculous cures pretended to be wrought by the water.</P>

Ken&s;ington. Here is a palace, which was pur|cha&s;ed of the earl of Nottingham by king Wil|liam, and, with its gardens, hath been greatly improved &s;ince by queen Anne and queen Caro|line. This palace has &s;ome elegant apartments, richly furni&s;hed, and adorned with original paint|ings. The gardens are very large, and laid out with excellent ta&s;te, as di&s;playing every where a noble &s;implicity and grandeur. The grand ba&s;on of water in the centre, and the Serpentine river, are great ornaments. The &s;pacious walks and lawns greatly contribute likewi&s;e to its embelli&s;h|ment. The air of the gravel-pits in the neigh|bourhood is much extolled; and &s;o is the &s;itua|tion of Holland-hou&s;e, a little to the we&s;t of it. On the &s;outh &s;ide of it lies Hyde-park, of great extent, and very beautiful, being planted with a va&s;t number and variety of tall &s;tately trees, finely di&s;po&s;ed and adorned with a grand piece of water in the centre, called the Serpentine-river, a re&s;ervoir near Gro&s;venor-gate, a grove towards the top, &s;ome fine &s;prings, and herds of deer. The nobility and gentry take the air here on hor&s;eback, or in coaches; and in the &s;ummer &s;ea|&s;on there are frequent reviews, at which his ma|je&s;ty is often pre&s;ent. At the corner of it, next We&s;tmin&s;ter, is St. George's-ho&s;pital, for the &s;ick and lame, which was fir&s;t opened in 1734. It has about three hundred governors, is &s;upported by voluntary &s;ub&s;criptions, and &s;o well managed and attended, that it is a very u&s;eful charity.</P>
<P>Chel&s;ea is a plea&s;ant and populous village upon the banks of the Thames, inhabited mo&s;tly by Londoners who have retired from bu&s;ine&s;s; but it is chiefly noted for three particulars: 1&s;t, Its ho&s;pital for lame, &s;ick, and &s;uperannuated &s;ol|diers. 2d, The apothecaries phy&s;ic - garden. 3d, Its porcelain manufacture. The ho&s;pital was
<PB N="216" REF="2200">
begun by Charles II. continued by James II. and fini&s;hed by William and Mary. The building con&s;i&s;ts of three &s;ides of a quadrangle, in which are apartments for betwixt four and five hundred &s;oldiers, officers civil and military, and &s;ervants, with a chapel, hall, &amp;c. The pen&s;ioners wear an uniform of red, lined with blue, and are provided with wa&s;hing, firing, diet, and lodging, and a day's pay every week. The out-pen&s;ioners &s;ome|times amount to ten thou&s;and, having each four|pence a-day for their maintenance. To defray the charge of all the&s;e, the army pays poundage, and a day's pay is &s;topped out from every officer and &s;oldier yearly. The apothecaries - garden contains all the different &s;pecies of medicinal plants hitherto di&s;covered, with a building, in which is a greenhou&s;e, apartments for the meeting of the company, and others for drying &s;eeds and plants, under the care of the celebrated Mr. Miller, the fir&s;t of his profe&s;&s;ion in Europe. The porcelain manufacture was carried on to great perfection at Chel&s;ea, but at pre&s;ent it &s;eems at a &s;tand. Near this village is Ranelagh-hou&s;e, an elegant rotun|da, erected for the entertainment of the public, with mu&s;ic and &s;inging. On one &s;ide is the orche&s;tra, and there are forty-eight boxes round it in a dou|ble row. It is &s;o &s;pacious, &s;o finely illuminated, painted, and gilded, and when filled, exhibits &s;uch a number of gentlemen and ladies in rich and &s;plendid dre&s;&s;es, that a &s;pectator is &s;truck in an ex|traordinary manner upon his fir&s;t entering it, and apt to fancy him&s;elf in an enchanted palace. The gardens are laid out in gravel walks, having a canal and ba&s;on, and are illuminated with a great num|ber of lamps.</P>

Hammer&s;mith is a pretty neat village, four miles from London, on the banks of the Thames, and he great we&s;tern-road.</P>
<P>Ea&s;t and We&s;t Acton are two villages which have their names from the oaks that grew about them formerly. At Ea&s;t-Acton are medicinal &s;prings, which were formerly much frequented. The latter has nothing remarkable in it unle&s;s it be the church.</P>
<P>Fulham has a wooden bridge over the Thames to Putney, at which not only hor&s;es and carriages, but al&s;o foot pa&s;&s;engers pay toll. In this village is a palace belonging to the bi&s;hop of London.</P>
<P>Che&s;wic, or Chi&s;wic, &s;tands plea&s;antly on the Thames, &s;ix miles from Hyde-park corner. It is chiefly noted for a &s;mall hou&s;e belonging to the late earl of Burlington, an elegant piece of archi|tecture, &s;eemingly built as the model of a larger palace. It is decorated with &s;ome valuable paint|ings, and the gardens are very agreeably laid out, and ornamented with bu&s;ts and &s;tatues.</P>
<P>Great and Little Ealing form one of the plea|&s;ante&s;t villages in the county. Among the many fine &s;eats in the pari&s;h, the chief is Gunner&s;bury-hou&s;e, lately purcha&s;ed by the prince&s;s Amelia. It &s;tands on an eminence between the two great we&s;tern roads, and was built by Mr. Webb, &s;on-in-law to the celebrated Inigo Jones. From a portico in the back front of the hou&s;e, there is a mo&s;t delightful pro&s;pect of London, Surry, and both banks of the Thames for &s;everal miles.</P>
<P>Brentford has its name from the little river Brent, on which it is &s;ituated, near where it falls into the Thames. Standing clo&s;e to the Thames, it &s;ends a great deal of corn to London by water, and &s;ome by land. It is al&s;o a great thoroughfare on the we&s;tern road. In a place on the north-&s;ide, called the Butts, the poll for knights of the &s;hire

On the we&s;t &s;ide, by the Thames, &s;tands Sion-hou&s;e a very noble &s;eat of the duke of Northumberland's. It had its name from a nunnery erected by Hen. V. and called Sion, from the holy mount of that name. In the neighbourhood is al&s;o O&s;terley-hou&s;e, built by Sir Thomas Gre&s;ham, founder of the Royal-Exchange, and afterwards was the &s;ea$ of Sir William Waller, the parliament-general, and of Dr. Barebones.</P>
<P>Uxbridge is noted for the treaty between king Charles I. and the parliament, and is a great tho|roughfare on the Oxford-road. Tho' in the pari&s;h of great Hillingdon, it has magi&s;trates of its own, namely, two bailiffs, two con&s;tables, and four tything-men, or head-boroughs. It gives title of earl to the family of Paget, and drives a con&s;idera|ble trade in meal &s;ent to London.</P>
<P>Hampton-Court. Here is a palace plea&s;antly &s;itu|ated on the Thames between two parks, and has fine gardens. It was built by cardinal Wol&s;ey, with all the magnificence known in that age; and afterwards &s;o much enlarged and embelli&s;hed by Henry VIII. that Grotius &s;ays, A traveller, after having &s;een all the mo&s;t magnificent palaces in the world, upon the &s;ight of this, would be apt to exclaim, <HI>Ibi reges, hic habitare deos:</HI> i. e. That princes there, but here the gods did dwell. Not only the palace, but al&s;o the parks and gardens have been greatly improved &s;ince by Charles I. Oliver Cromwell, who made it his &s;ummer re&s;i|dence, and in particular by king William and Mary, queen Anne, and George I. yet it is now again neglected, his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty having made choice of Richmond for his &s;ummer-retreat.

fine inimitable pieces of Raphael Urbin, called the Cartoons, that were brought hither by king William, have been lately removed to the queen's palace at We&s;tmin&s;ter. For the&s;e Carroons the late French king is &s;aid to have offered one hun|dred thou&s;and pounds. It is not &s;aying too much, when we affirm that the palace, parks, and gardens, have every embelli&s;hment that can &s;erve to render them inchanting and delightful. The village, from which the palace takes its name, is pretty well built, and agreeable.</P>
<P>Staines is plea&s;antly &s;ituated upon the Thames, and derives its name from a &s;tone that was antient|ly &s;et up here, to mark the extent of the city of London's juri&s;diction upon the river. It is a pretty good town, has a wooden bridge over the river, and is governed by two con&s;tables and four head|boroughs, appointed by the king's &s;teward, be|cau&s;e the honour or manor belongs to the crown.</P>
<P>Harrow on the Hill, which &s;tanding high, the church upon it, with its lofty &s;teeple, is &s;een at a great di&s;tance.

<P>Enfield is a very pretty market-town, &s;tands clo&s;e to the chace on the ea&s;t &s;ide, and is almo&s;t &s;urrounded by the New-river. Its name was ori|ginally $$nfin or Infin, from its &s;ituation in fenny or moori&s;h ground; but now, in&s;tead of fens, there are fine corn-fields all around, except where the chace lies. Over again&s;t the church is a large old hou&s;e, &s;aid to have been a royal palace in queen Elizabeth's time. The chace, which is a part of the dutchy of Lanca&s;ter, and has been an|nexed to it ever &s;ince Henry IV. married a daugh|ter and coheir of the la&s;t of the Bohuns, is of great extent, over-run with trees and thickets, and has a good lodge for the ranger. When king James I. who took great delight in hunting, re&s;ided at Theo|balds in the neighbourhood, it was full of game, deer, and timber; but it has undergone great changes &s;ince that time.</P>
<P>Southgate. At the &s;outh-gate of the chace is a very beautiful village, called from thence South-gate. It &s;tands on a ri&s;ing ground, and enjoys a remarkably fine air.</P>
<P>Tottenham &s;tands on one of the great northern roads. In this place is a cro&s;s, once very high, and thence called Tottenham-high-cro&s;s. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been built in con&s;equence of an order of the church of Rome, to erect cro&s;&s;es in the mo&s;t frequented places of every pari&s;h, and to have been only repaired, embelli&s;hed, or rai&s;ed higher by Edward I. when the corp&s;e of his queen re&s;ted here, in its way to London. Betwixt Tot|tenham and London, upon the &s;ame road, lies Stoke-Newington, a large hand&s;ome village.</P>
<P>Bromley and Bow by Stratford are villages &s;eated on the confines of the county towards E&s;&s;ex. The fir&s;t had its name from the broom that formerly

grew about it, and had antiently a mona&s;tery, on the &s;ide of which now &s;tands the manor-hou&s;e, called Bromley-hall. The church is the lord of the manor's donative, and the pari&s;h very &s;mall. The other village has its name from the arches of the bridge built over the Lea by order of Maud, wife to Henry I. and daughter of Mal|colm Canmore, king of Scotland, who had been in danger of being drowned as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the river at Oldford in the neighbourhood. It is noted for dying &s;carlet; and the church, which was before a chapel of ea&s;e to Stepney, has been many years made parochial. There are &s;everal other villages in this county, as I&s;leworth, Edmonton, Par&s;on's|green, Finchley, &amp;c. &s;ome of which, tho' only called villages, are equal to large towns <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Be&s;ides the charitable foundations already de&s;cribed, there are &s;ome others in and a|bout London lately e&s;tabli&s;hed, which we &s;hall ju&s;t mention here, not having room to de|&s;cribe them particularly: the&s;e are the London - ho&s;pital in Whitechapel-road, the Magda|len-hou&s;e for the reception of penitent pro&s;titutes, in Good-man's-fields, the Lying-in-ho&s;pital Alder&s;gate - &s;treet, the Small-pox ho&s;pital near Pancras, the Middle&s;ex-ho&s;pi|tal in Marybone - fields, the Lying-in-ho&s;pital in Brown|low - &s;treet, Long - acre, and the Lock-ho&s;pital, Hyde-park|corner.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>This county is bounded on the we&s;t by Berk|&s;hire and Hamp&s;hire, on the &s;outh by Su&s;&s;ex, on
<PB N="224" REF="2280">
the ea&s;t by Kent, on the north by Middle&s;ex, from which it is parted by the Thames, whence it had the name of Suth-rey, from the Saxons, i. e. the country on the &s;outh &s;ide the river. It is thirty-four miles in length from ea&s;t to we&s;t, twenty-one in breadth from north to &s;outh, and one hundred and twelve in circumference. It contains thirteen hundreds, one hundred and forty pari&s;hes, of which thirty-five are vicarages, eleven market-towns, four hundred and fifty villages, five hun|dred and ninety-two thou&s;and acres, and about one hundred and &s;eventy thou&s;and inhabitants. The members &s;ent from it to parliament are fourteen, of which two are &s;ent by each of the following boroughs, viz. Southwark, Bleechingley, Rye|gate, Guildford, Gatton, Ha&s;lemere, which we &s;hall de&s;cribe in order, and two for the county.</P>

<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, PRODUCE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>The air of this county towards the middle, con|&s;i&s;ting mo&s;tly of hills and heath, is &s;harp, but pure and whole&s;ome. About the &s;kirts, where it is more level, and the &s;oil richer, the air is milder, but &s;till &s;alubrious. In the middle parts the &s;oil is barren enough in general; but towards the ex|tremities, and where the country is open and champaign, it is fruitful in gra&s;s and corn, parti|cularly on the &s;outh-&s;ide in Holm&s;dale, in which meadows, woods, and corn-fields, are agreeably intermixed. The &s;oil is al&s;o very fertile along the Thames, e&s;pecially towards London, where it greatly contributes to maintain plenty in the Lon|don markets. It has &s;everal rivers, abounding with fi&s;h, the chief of which are the Wye, the Mole, and the Wandle. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is of great benefit to the county, being navigable from Weybridge to the Thames, and thereby &s;upply|ing
<PB N="225" REF="2290">
many parts of it with nece&s;&s;aries of all &s;orts. The Mole is &s;o called, becau&s;e it runs about two miles under ground, entering at a place named the Swallows, at the bottom of Boxhill, and emerging again, as is commonly thought, at Leatherhead. The chief articles of commerce produced in the county are corn, boxwood, wal|nuts, and fullers-earth, which is &s;old at a groat a bu&s;hel.</P>

<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Southwark had its name from its &s;ituation in re&s;pect of London, from which it is &s;eparated only by the bridge. It contains &s;ix pari&s;hes, viz. St. Olave, St. John at Hor&s;leydown, St. Saviour, vulgarly called St. Mary Overey, St. George, St. Thomas, and Chri&s;t-church. The other pari&s;hes in the bills of mortality in Surrey are, St. Mary's, at Lambeth, St. Mary Magdalen, Bermond&s;ey, St. Mary's, Newington, and St. Mary's, Rother|hithe. All the&s;e lie along the river, from Vaux|hall to Deptford, for the &s;pace of about &s;even miles. The Borough, as it is commonly called, in wealth, populou&s;ne&s;s, and extent, is inferior to few cities. It was purcha&s;ed of king Edward VI. for &s;ix hundred and forty-&s;even pounds, two &s;hillings, and one penny, by the mayor, commonalty, and citizens of London, and immediately erected into a ward, under the name of Bridgward without; of con&s;equence, its inhabitants became intitled to all the laws and privileges of the city of London, and the lord-mayor of London to the authority and rights of a ju&s;tice of peace and e&s;cheator within the borough and precincts. It is governed, under the lord mayor and aldermen of the ward, by a &s;teward and bailiff. But be&s;ides the pur|cha&s;e-money mentioned above, a further &s;um of five hundred marks was afterwards paid by the city
<PB N="226" REF="2300">
to the crown, in con&s;ideration of the grant. It had formerly a noble mona&s;tery of Benedictines, called Bermond&s;ey, be&s;ides a priory, and two palaces, one built by Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk, and another belonging to the bi&s;hops of Winche&s;|ter. It is divided into two parts, the Borough-li|berty, and the clink or manor of Southwark. In each of the&s;e is a court of record for debts, dama|ges, and tre&s;pa&s;&s;es. In that for the Borough-li|berty, the lord-mayor's &s;teward is judge, the li|berty being under his juri&s;diction. In that for the clink, the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter's &s;teward and bailiff are judges, it being under the juri&s;diction of that &s;ee. In both divi&s;ions are al&s;o held court|leets, and to each there belongs a pri&s;on. As to the military government of Southwark, there is a lord-lieutenant, and eleven deputy-lieutenants, who have under them a regiment of &s;ix companies of one hundred and fifty men each.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now ju&s;t mention the mo&s;t remarka|ble places in the &s;everal pari&s;hes abovemention|ed, beginning with</P>
<P>St. Saviour's. The church of this pari&s;h, vul|garly called St. Mary Overy, from its dedication to the virgin Mary, and &s;ituation over the Ree or river, in re&s;pect of London, is a &s;tately Gothic &s;tructure, in the form of a cathedral. What is remarkable with regard to this church is, that it was granted, together with the tithes, to the church|wardens and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors for ever, to provide two chaplains at their plea&s;ure, who are neither pre&s;ent|ed nor endowed. In this pari&s;h is, fir&s;t, the &s;e&s;&s;ions|hou&s;e on St. Margaret's-hill, on the &s;outh-&s;ide of which, in a niche, &s;tands the &s;tatue of James II. in his royal robes, holding a &s;ceptre. Secondly, the Talbot inn, where, by an in&s;cription on the main beam, it appears that Sir Jeffery Chaucer and twenty-nine pilgrims, in their way to Canter|bury,
<PB N="227" REF="2310">
lodged in the year 1383. Its &s;ign was an|tiently a tabard, that is, a coat without &s;leeves, whence certain &s;cholars in Queen's-college, Ox|fords, are &s;till called tabarders, from their hav|ing formerly worn that habit. Thirdly, here was antiently the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter's pa|lace and park; and on the bank-&s;ide were public &s;tews licen&s;ed by the bi&s;hop, under certain regu|lations, confirmed by act of parliament: whence the lewd women were called Winche&s;ter gee&s;e. Fourthly, the pri&s;on of the clink is in this pari&s;h, a foundery, and a machine for rai&s;ing water, to &s;up|ply the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t-Church pari&s;h belonged to St. Saviour's, till &s;eparated from it in 1670. Here was antiently two bear-gardens, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the fir&s;t erected near London, and now there is a gla&s;s-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>St. George's pari&s;h. Where the church of this pa|ri&s;h now &s;tands, was formerly that of the abbey of Bermond&s;ey. Here is a place that formerly claimed the privilege of protection from arre&s;ts, called the Mint, becau&s;e there was once a coinage of money in it; but this pretended privilege was aboli&s;hed by act of parliament in the reign of king William. Here is al&s;o the King's-Bench pri&s;on, who&s;e rules are of con&s;iderable extent, and which is properly a place of confinement in all ca&s;es triable in the court of King's Bench. It is in fact a neat little town, in St. George's fields, &s;urrounded by high walls, which include a piece of ground in which the pri&s;oners exerci&s;e them&s;elves in a variety of diver&s;ions. The Mar&s;hal&s;ea-court and pri&s;on are likewi&s;e in this pari&s;h. Of the court the knight mar&s;hal is pre&s;ident, and his &s;teward judge. Actions for debt, damages, and tre&s;pa&s;&s;es ten miles round Whitehall, excepting London, are cognizable here. It was originally intended
<PB N="228" REF="2320">
for the cognizance of cau&s;es between the king's dome&s;tics. The pri&s;on is the county and admi|ralty gaol, as well as of the court. The White Lyon pri&s;on, or county-bridewell, is likewi&s;e in this pari&s;h, where are alms-hou&s;es under the di|rection of the fi&s;hmongers company of London, be&s;ides &s;everal others.</P>
<P>St. Olave's pari&s;h. In this pari&s;h is a free-&s;chool founded by queen Elizabeth, and many wharfs for &s;hipping and landing goods. Here was an|tiently the city-re&s;idence of the abbot of Canter|bury, and al&s;o that of the abbot of Battle, in Su&s;&s;ex, from whom the bridge called Battle-bridge took its name, as the place named the Maze did from the wilderne&s;s in his garden.</P>
<P>St. John's, Hor&s;ley-down, is taken out of St. Olave's, and the church is one of the fifty new ones. The pari&s;h is &s;aid to have had its name from its be|ing a field formerly, where hor&s;es grazed. Here too was once the artillery-ground and hou&s;e belonging to the trained-bands of Southwark.</P>
<P>St. Thomas's. The church of this pari&s;h was fir&s;t intended for the ho&s;pital of St. Thomas, but afterwards made parochial, and a chapel erected in the ho&s;pital for the u&s;e of the patients. The ho&s;pitals of St. Thomas and Guy, both in this pa|ri&s;h, are two noble foundations. St. Thomas's for the cure of the &s;ick, lame, and infirm, was founded by Edward VI. but the pre&s;ent &s;truc|ture, which is very large and commodious, con|&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal courts, was built in 1693 and 1732, and now it takes in &s;uch a number of pa|tients, that the annual di&s;bur&s;ements amount to near eight thou&s;and pounds. The num|ber of patients in and out of the ho&s;pital are ge|nerally betwixt &s;ix and &s;even hundred. There are nineteen wards, and four hundred and &s;eventy-four beds, the utmo&s;t care being taken of the
<PB N="229" REF="2330">
patients. Be&s;ides the lord-mayor and aldermen, there are upwards of two hundred governors. At a little di&s;tance from this ho&s;pital is Guy's, one of the noble&s;t private charities perhaps in the world. The founder, Mr. Guy, a book&s;eller in London, left two hundred and thirty-eight thou|&s;and pounds for building and endowing it. The building con&s;i&s;ts of two &s;pacious &s;quares, with twelve wards, and four hundred and thirty-five beds. In 1738, there were four hundred and &s;ix patients, be|&s;ides out-patients; and the expences of the hou&s;e in 1737, amounted to &s;even thou&s;and nine hundred and &s;eventy-eight pounds, fourteen &s;hillings, and one penny. The ho&s;pital takes in incurables, as well as others.</P>
<P>St. Mary's Newington, or Newton. The vil|lage called Newington Butts, in this pari&s;h, had the epithet of butts, from the butts at which they u&s;ed to &s;hoot formerly, to acquire a dexterity in archery, before the invention of fire-arms. It hath been much improved and enlarged of late, as have mo&s;t of the other villages about London. At the corner of Kent-&s;treet is the Lock-ho&s;pital, belonging to St. Bartholomew's in London, and employed chiefly for the cure of venereal patients. Of the two alms-hou&s;es in the pari&s;h, that be|longing to the fi&s;hmongers is a very large, hand|&s;ome, convenient &s;tructure, con&s;i&s;ting of three courts. At Kennington was antiently a royal man|&s;ion, and on its common is now a place for the execution of criminals.</P>
<P>St. Mary's, Lambeth, is a large pari&s;h, about &s;even miles in circumference, divided into four liberties and eight precincts. The archbi&s;hops of Canterbury have long had a palace here, which is a very &s;tately venerable pile, con&s;i&s;ting of a tower on the north-&s;ide, called the Lollards tower, be|cau&s;e the&s;e people u&s;ed formerly to be impri&s;oned
<PB N="230" REF="2340">
in it, as the king's adherents were during the civil wars, a chapel, guard-room, hall, gallery, library, and cloy&s;ters, be&s;ides the archbi&s;hop's apartments. The north part is very antient; a part of it was built by cardinal Pole, and the whole repaired by archbi&s;hop Juxon. There is a piece of ground in this pari&s;h, now built upon, called Pedlar's|acre, given by a pedlar, on condition that his and his dog's pictures &s;hould be perpetually pre|&s;erved in the church in painted gla&s;s. Through Lambeth-mar&s;h and St. George's fields, runs the canal that was made by Canute, to turn off the cour&s;e of the Thames, and bring his fleet of &s;mall ve&s;&s;els to the we&s;t &s;ide of London-bridge. Oppo|&s;ite to Somer&s;et-hou&s;e, in this pari&s;h, were for|merly Cuper's-gardens, laid out in agreeable walks, with a pretty temple for the accommodation of a band of mu&s;ic, to entertain the company that vi|&s;ited them in the &s;ummer evenings. But the pub|lic gardens in this pari&s;h, called Vauxhall-gardens, are perhaps the fine&s;t of the kind in Europe. They are laid out in the mo&s;t elegant ta&s;te, and every object con&s;pires to ravi&s;h the beholder; &s;uch as the &s;hady walks and groves, the ruins, &s;tatues, pavilions, all heightened and &s;et off with the charms of mu&s;ic, vocal and in&s;trumental, and the &s;olemn &s;hade of lofty trees; the whole &s;cene animated by the glare of an infinite number of lamps, di&s;per&s;ed &s;o as to produce the greate&s;t wonder and delight. Near Vauxhall-turnpike, in this pari&s;h, are the remains of a Roman fort or entrenchment, and of another at the corner of St. George's fields, near the Ducking-pond, where urns, coins, and te&s;&s;elated pavements have been frequently found. A Roman military way likewi&s;e extended from the Hor&s;e-ferry to Vauxhall, from thence to the Ducking-pond,
<PB N="231" REF="2350">
thence acro&s;s St. George's fields to the windmill, thence to the end of Kent-&s;treet, where was a &s;tone fortre&s;s, and thence to the Grange, near Bermond&s;ey-&s;treet, where was another; &s;o that lines and forts &s;eem to have run round from the Thames at Lambeth to Deptford. It was at Lambeth, that the Dani&s;h king Canute breathed his la&s;t in the mid&s;t of his cups. In this pari&s;h are gla&s;s-hou&s;es and potteries; and at the Dog and Duck by St. George's fields, is a mineral water, which is &s;aid to give relief in the &s;curvy and many other ca&s;es.</P>
<P>St. Mary's, Rotherhithe, vulgarly called Red|riff, is inhabited chiefly by &s;ea-faring people and watermen, has three docks for &s;hip-build|ing, a copperas work, a corn-mill belonging to the king, and a free-&s;chool for the education of eight mariners &s;ons.</P>
<P>St. Mary Magdalen's, Bermond&s;ey. In this pa|ri&s;h was antiently the &s;tately abbey called Ber|mond&s;ey, from whence to the Thames went a wa|ter-cour&s;e that &s;till remains, but is not now naviga|ble, as it was formerly. Here is now a dock called St. Saviour's.</P>
<P>Having given &s;ome account of Southwark and the neighbouring pari&s;hes, we now proceed to treat of the other parliamentary boroughs.</P>
<P>Guildford, &s;tanding on the river Wye, which is navigable from thence to the Thames, is by &s;ome called the county-town, becau&s;e the elec|tions for knights of the &s;hire are always held in it, and often the a&s;&s;izes. Here certain lands were an|tiently held by the tenure of maintaining the king's laundre&s;&s;es, called, in the Latin of tho&s;e times, meretrices, whence &s;ome writers have &s;aid that it was for maintaining the king's mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. It is a corporation, governed by a mayor, recorder,
<PB N="232" REF="2360">
&s;even aldermen, and &s;ixteen bailiffs, and has always &s;ent members to parliament. It has two churches, a free-&s;chool founded by king Edward VI. a hand&s;ome alms-hou&s;e endowed by George Abbot, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, called Trinity-ho&s;pital, and two charity-&s;chools. With regard to its trade, its market is one of the greate&s;t in England for corn, a great part of which, as well as of that bought at Farnham, is ground in the mills upon the river, and &s;ent in meal to London. Thither al&s;o, by the &s;ame conveyance, is &s;ent a great deal of timber, brought not from the neighbourhood only, but al&s;o from Su&s;&s;ex. Here and all around, was formerly a great manu|facture of cloth, which is now incon&s;iderable. On the top of a hill, near the town, is the gallows, &s;o that the executions may be ea&s;ily &s;een from the town. The wheat in the neighbourhood, having a red &s;talk, is very good, and bears a high price. A battle is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been fought here, where the two hillocks, called Robin-hood's butts &s;tand, in which &s;ome of the chiefs &s;lain in the en|gagement are thought to be buried. The town gives the title of earl to the family of North; it has very good inns, being on the road to Port&s;|mouth and Chiche&s;ter.</P>
<P>Blechingley is a &s;mall, but antient town, and a borough by pre&s;cription, yet has no market. It is &s;ituated on the &s;ide of Holms&s;dale, on a hill, whence there is a very exten&s;ive pro&s;pect, and has a hand&s;ome church, a free-&s;chool for twenty poor children, and antiently had a ca&s;tle. The manor belongs to the family of Clayton, at who&s;e court-leet the bailiff, who is the returning officer, is annually cho&s;en.</P>
<P>Rhiegate or Ryegate: by the name of this bo|rough is meant the channel of a river. It &s;tands in the vale of Holme&s;dale, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to
<PB N="233" REF="2370">
derive its name from the holm-trees with which it abounds, as well as with chalk, fullers-earth, and medicinal plants. It had antiently a ca&s;tle, of which there yet remains a vault, capable of holding five hundred per&s;ons, in which, it is &s;aid, the barons held their meetings when they took up arms again&s;t king John. There was al&s;o a priory here formerly. In a vault, under the church, are many monuments of the Howards, earls of Nottingham. In the neighbourhood is a very fine &s;eat called Flankford. It is a borough by pre&s;cription, and governed like the former.</P>
<P>Gatton is another borough by pre&s;cription. Tho' it is now a mean village, it was formerly a large town. It is governed by a con&s;table, who returns its members, and is cho&s;en at the court-leet of the lord of the manor. From the coins and other Roman antiquities found here, it is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been one of their &s;tations.</P>
<P>Ha&s;lemere is a paltry place, but a borough by pre&s;cription, and its con&s;titution the &s;ame as the former. It is &s;uppo&s;ed, and with &s;ome probabi|lity, to have had a different &s;ituation, and to have been much more con&s;iderable formerly than it is now.</P>
<P>We come now to de&s;cribe the other towns, &s;ome of which, tho' not parliamentary, are of much more note than mo&s;t of tho&s;e that are, particularly</P>
<P>King&s;ton, which took its name from having been the re&s;idence of many of the Saxon kings, &s;ome of whom were crowned here. Over the Thames at this place is a wooden bridge of twen|ty arches, and here the &s;ummer a&s;&s;izes are gene|rally held. In this town was antiently a hou&s;e of Richard Nevil, earl of Warwick, who, from his depo&s;ing and &s;etting up Henry VI. and Edward IV. was called the King-maker. Combe Nevil,
<PB N="234" REF="2380">
at a little di&s;tance to the &s;outh, was another &s;eat of the &s;ame nobleman. Medals and coins of &s;e|veral Roman emperors are often found about it and the town; and ea&s;t from it, upon a gra|velly-hill, was a burying-place of the Romans. There are &s;everal &s;prings in the neighbour|hood, whence water is conveyed in leaden pipes under the Thames to Hampton-Court. From another &s;pring in a cellar, near the town, flows a brook, which has a bridge over it at King&s;ton. Oppo&s;ite to Combe is a royal-park, one of the large&s;t in England, being eleven miles round. In the mid&s;t of it is a mount, called King Henry's, whence there is a mo&s;t exten&s;ive pro&s;pect. King|&s;ton is a large town, has a good market for corn, a free-&s;chool erected and endowed by queen Elizabeth, an alms-hou&s;e founded by alderman Cleave of London, and a &s;pacious church, with eight bells, in which the pictures of Athel|&s;tan, Etheldred I. and II. Edwin, and Edward the Martyr, who were crowned here, and of king John, who gave the town its fir&s;t charter, are pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>Peter&s;ham is a very plea&s;ant village. It was heretofore &s;o privileged from arre&s;ts, that no offi|cer dur&s;t bring an arre&s;ted per&s;on thro', much le&s;s arre&s;t one in it. The earl of Harrington, to whom it gives the title of vi&s;count, as it formerly did of baron to the duke of Lauderdale, in the reign of Charles II. has a fine &s;eat here, on the very &s;pot where the earl of Roche&s;ter's-hou&s;e for|merly &s;tood.</P>
<P>Richmond. The fir&s;t royal palace built here was by Edward III. but that was levelled with the ground by Richard II. for grief that he had lo&s;t his queen there. Another erected by Henry V. was burnt down by an accidental fire in 1500.
<PB N="235" REF="2390">
The pre&s;ent &s;tructure was built by Hen. VII. and its name changed from Sheen to Richmond, of which place he had been earl before he came to the throne; but both the hou&s;e and gardens have been greatly improved &s;ince, particularly by his late maje&s;ty and queen Caroline, the former of whom pur|cha&s;ed the hou&s;es on Kew-Green, where his pre|&s;ent maje&s;ty, when prince of Wales, u&s;ed to re|&s;ide in &s;ummer. It is &s;till the &s;ummer-re&s;idence of her royal highne&s;s the prince&s;s-dowager of Wales. Of late years a con&s;iderable extent of ground has been taken into the gardens of Kew, which are agreeably laid out in lawns, walks, and groves, imbelli&s;hed with temples, alcoves, and a very lofty brick tower in the Chine&s;e &s;tile of archi|tecture. On Kew-Green there is a great number of elegant country hou&s;es belonging to the royal family, and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, now rendered the more agreeable and commodious by the new bridge built over the Thames at this place. The palace of Richmond, which is but an incon&s;iderable building, in re&s;pect of air and &s;ituation, yields to few, if any, and is adorned with &s;ome good paintings. The grand terras of the garden, which overlooks the river, is admired by all foreigners. The town extends a full mile up the hill from the Thames, &s;kirted and inter|mingled with gardens. The &s;ummit of Rich|mond-hill affords a mo&s;t inchanting pro&s;pect of towns, villages, bridges, woods, groves, gardens, fields, and an incredible number of delightful villas along the banks of the river Thames, which winds with a &s;erpentine cour&s;e through this delicious vale from King&s;ton to London. The tide, before the building of We&s;tmin&s;ter-bridge, u&s;ed to ri&s;e as high as this town, but now falls &s;hort of it. On the top of the hill is an alms-hou&s;e for ten poor widows, founded by Duppa, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, in the
<PB N="236" REF="2400">
reign of Charles II. in di&s;charge of a vow he had made.</P>
<P>Wand&s;worth, Batter&s;ea, Putney, and Wimbleton are four very hand&s;ome villages, plea&s;antly &s;i|tuated. Many rich citizens and gentlemen have &s;eats about them, e&s;pecially on Putney|common. Batter&s;ea gives the title of baron to lord vi&s;count Bolingbroke. Wand&s;worth has its name from the river Wandle, which there falls into the Thames, and has a bridge over it. It has a manufacture of bra&s;s-plates, kettles, &s;killets, and frying-pans; and a great many dyers live in the town.</P>
<P>Dulwich is remarkable for its college, founded in 1619 by Mr. Alleyn, who has been a player, for a ma&s;ter and warden, who were always to be of his own name, and bachelors; four fellows, of whom three were to be divines, and the other an organi&s;t; &s;ix poor men, and as many poor women, with a &s;chool for the education of twelve boys. Tho&s;e who have a ta&s;te for the country will be much plea&s;ed with the rural &s;implicity of Norwood, thro' which there is an agreeable walk from the public-hou&s;e called the Green-man, to the top of the hill, from whence there is a mag|nificent pro&s;pect of London. On the farther &s;ide of this hill are the medicinal wells of Sydenham, the name of another village in the neighbour|hood.</P>
<P>Stretham. The only thing for which this place de&s;erves to be mentioned is its medicinal &s;prings, di&s;covered in 1660.</P>
<P>Ep&s;om is a village noted for its numerous mine|ral waters. The &s;itutation is extremely plea&s;ant, dry, and healthy, in the neighbourhood of Ban&s;ted|downs; for which rea&s;on many gentlemen and merchants have &s;eats about it. But none of the&s;e are comparable to that at the end of the town
<PB N="237" REF="2410">
called Durdan's, belonging to the earl of Guild|ford. In the neighbourhood there was once a magnificent royal palace, called Non&s;uch, built by Henry VIII. but pulled down in the reign of Charles II. Its purging waters are not &s;o much frequented as they u&s;ed to be. On the neighbour|ing downs are hor&s;e-races in May, which occa&s;ion a great re&s;ort of company.</P>
<P>Farnham is &s;aid to take its name from the ferns growing about it. It was given by Aethelbald, king of the We&s;t Saxons, to the bi&s;hop and con|gregation of Winche&s;ter; and &s;ince that time the bi&s;hop hath generally re&s;ided here in &s;ummer in the ca&s;tle, which was built in a noble &s;ituation by Henry of Blois, brother of king Stephen, and bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter. The cloathing trade was once very con&s;iderable here, though little or nothing of it is left now: but, till within the&s;e few years, here was one of the greate&s;t wheat-markets in England. One day with another, two hundred and fifty loads of wheat u&s;ed to be &s;old here; and the toll, at a medium, amounted to two hundred pounds a-year: but the market and meal trade have declined greatly &s;ince the people about Chiche&s;ter and Southampton began to &s;end their wheat in meal to London by &s;ea. This place is al&s;o noted for its hop-gardens, in which it is &s;aid between three and four hundred acres are employ|ed. Not only this town, but all the other market|towns in the county, had either fifty pounds a-year for ever in land, or one thou&s;and pounds in money, and every other pari&s;h almo&s;t &s;ix or eight pounds yearly, left them by one Smith, who had been a &s;ilver-&s;mith in London, but afterwards went a begging, and was called Dog-Smith, from a dog that always followed him. Mitcham was expre&s;ly excluded from his bounty, becau&s;e he had been whipt out of it as a common vagrant.
<PB N="238" REF="2420">
This town is large and populous, and governed by bailiffs and burge&s;&s;es under the bi&s;hop of Win|che&s;ter.</P>
<P>Godalming, who&s;e name &s;ignifies Goda, or Go|diva's alms, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been given by her to &s;ome religious hou&s;e, is a corporation, and its chief magi&s;trate a warden, cho&s;en annually. The cloth manufacture, e&s;pecially that of ker&s;eys, both mixed and blue, flouri&s;hes here more than in any other part of the county. It is &s;aid to have been antiently a bi&s;hop's &s;ee, the revenues of which were afterwards conferred on the dean of Sarum. In the pari&s;h is the manor of Catte&s;hall, or Gate&s;|hill, which was annexed to the honourable office of ma&s;ter of the king's-concubines. The town is noted for its fuel, which is peat, for the be&s;t brown paper made in its mills upon the river Lodden, and for liquorice and carrots. The river Wye has been lately made navigable from Guild|ford to this town.</P>
<P>Woking is a private country town out of any great road, and is therefore little heard of. Here are the remains of a royal hou&s;e, in which the old counte&s;s of Richmond, mother to Henry VII. re&s;ided. In this and other church-yards, where the &s;oil is a light red &s;and, a kind of plant, about the thickne&s;s of a bullru&s;h, with a head like that of a&s;paragus, which ri&s;es almo&s;t to the &s;urface, but never above it, is found in the graves, while the fle&s;h of a corp&s;e remains uncon&s;umed, after which it dies away; the out&s;ide of it is black, but the in&s;ide red.</P>
<P>Bag&s;hot. Here was formerly a royal hou&s;e and park, to which king James and king Charles I. often repaired for the &s;ake of hunting. The town has good inns. The heath is a barren de&s;art of great extent, over-run with furze; but, by &s;ome late trials, the &s;oil is found capable of improve|ment.
<PB N="239" REF="2430">
In &s;ome parts it is beautified with clumps of fir and beech, planted by his late royal highne&s;s William, duke of Cumberland.</P>
<P>Egham is &s;ituated on the Thames over-again&s;t Staines, and has &s;ome good inns, be&s;ides alms-hou&s;es and charity-&s;chools well endowed. In the field to the north of the town, called Rumney, Running, and Council mead, the great charter which laid the foundation of the Engli&s;h liberties, was &s;igned by king John. In that which is now the par&s;onage-hou&s;e lived Sir John Denham, au|thor of that celebrated poem called Cowper's-hill.</P>
<P>Chert&s;ey. Hither Cowley, the famous poet, retired from the &s;ervility and dependence, the &s;plendid farce and in&s;ignificant pomp of a court, to the health, quiet, and freedom of a country life. This town and hundred has a bailiff appointed by the exchequer, independent of the high-&s;heriff. At Coway-&s;takes, near this place, Julius Cae&s;ar pa&s;&s;ed the Thames. The town has a hand&s;ome free-&s;chool.</P>
<P>Croydon, antiently Cradiden, is &s;ituated upon the edge of Ban&s;ted-downs, and is large and hand|&s;ome. Here is a palace of the archbi&s;hops of Canterbury, now much neglected, and an ho&s;pi|tal erected and endowed by archbi&s;hop Whitgift, for a warden and twenty-eight poor men and wo|men, with a &s;chool for ten boys and ten girls. In the church, which is one of the fine&s;t of the county, are many remarkable monuments, particularly tho&s;e of Dr. Grindall and archbi&s;hop Sheldon. A great deal of charcoal is made here, and a great quantity of oats, oatmeal, wheat, and barley, &s;old in the market and carried to London.</P>
<P>Ban&s;ted is a village noted for giving name to tho&s;e beautiful downs that extend under different appellations for thirty miles, from Croydon to Farnham, and are covered with a fine carpet of
<PB N="240" REF="2440">
&s;hort gra&s;s, perfumed with thyme and juniper. The air of them is very pure and plea&s;ant, the mutton &s;mall, but &s;weet, and the pro&s;pect very exten&s;ive and agreeable.</P>
<P>Darking &s;tands on a rock of &s;oft &s;andy &s;tone, in which are dug many convenient cellars; and it has a good market for meat, wheat, fi&s;h, poultry, and e&s;pecially fat gee&s;e and capons, brought hither from Hor&s;ham in Su&s;&s;ex, about which great num|bers of them are bred and fattened. The great Roman cau&s;eway, called Store-&s;treet, made of flints and pebbles, from &s;even to ten yards broad, and near a yard and a half deep, pa&s;&s;es through the church-yard, and may be traced a great way. In this manor, if the cu&s;tomary tenant dies inte&s;|tate, his younge&s;t &s;on or brother &s;ucceeds to the e&s;tate. From Box-hill, in the neighbourhood, &s;o called from the great quantities of that wood grow|ing upon it, is a mo&s;t enchanting pro&s;pect, e&s;peci|ally to the &s;outh.</P>
<P>Okeley has its name from the oaks grow|ing about it, where a remarkable cu&s;tom has pre|vailed, time immemorial, of planting ro&s;e-bu&s;hes upon the graves, e&s;pecially of the young of both &s;exes by their &s;urviving relations or lovers. Here was formerly a ca&s;tle in this town, and a bloody battle was fought near it between king Ethelwolf and the Danes. In the pari&s;h adjoining is a very high hill, called Lith-hill, whence, in a clear day, is one of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive pro&s;pects in Europe, tak|ing in a circumference of two hundred and &s;ixty miles, including all Surrey and Su&s;&s;ex, part of Kent, E&s;&s;ex, Middle&s;ex, Hertford&s;hire, Buckingham|&s;hire, Oxford&s;hire, Berk&s;hire beyond Wind&s;or|ca&s;tle, Hamp&s;hire, and, as it is believed, Wilt&s;hire.</P>

<P>Be&s;ides the antiquities already mentioned, there are, fir&s;t, a camp of twelve acres in the pari&s;h of Walton upon Thames, which Dr. Gib&s;on thinks took its name from the vallum. Secondly, an|other large camp near Darking, containing about ten acres, with double deep trenches. Thirdly, a perfect Roman way on Letherhead-downs, in the road from London to Darking. Fourthly, two &s;quare Roman camps on the tops of two hills at &s;ome di&s;tance from Beddington. Fifthly, a cir|cular fortification, called Ben&s;bury, near Wim|bleton, where Ceaulin, king of the We&s;t Saxons, defeated Aethelbert, king of Kent. Sixthly, the plain ve&s;tiges of a large town at Effingham, a &s;mall village not far from Letherhead. Seventhly, the platform of a Roman temple, five miles ea&s;t of Guildford. Eighthly, the &s;keleton of a man nine feet three inches long, found in the church|yard at Wotton. Ninthly, a pa&s;&s;age a furlong in length, dug through the bottom of a hill, &s;ome|thing like that near Naples, only that it does not go quite through, near Aldbury, five miles ea&s;t of Guildford. It was intended as a way to a &s;eat of the duke of Norfolk, but the original de&s;ign was fru&s;trated by a rock at the &s;outh end; however, it is &s;till pre&s;erved as a curio&s;ity.

<HEAD>BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>The name of this county is, with great probabi|lity, &s;uppo&s;ed to be derived from &s;ome word in the antient language of the Gauls, &s;ignifying a corner, in which it is actually &s;ituated, and by which name it was di&s;tingui&s;hed by all the antient geographers; e&s;pecially as many other places of the like &s;ituation have names &s;omewhat &s;imilar; and the French expre&s;s a corner by the word canton, which being derived neither from the German nor Latin, mu&s;t from the Galic or Celtic, the modern French being compo&s;ed of the&s;e three. It has the Downs on the ea&s;t, Surrey on the we&s;t, Middle&s;ex and E&s;&s;ex on the north, from both which it is di|vided by the Thames, and the Engli&s;h channel and Su&s;&s;ex on the &s;outh and &s;outh-we&s;t. It is divided into five lathes, and the&s;e into &s;ixty-eight hun|dreds extending in length fifty-&s;ix miles, in breadth thirty, and in circumference one hundred and &s;ixty-&s;ix, within which it contains one million two hundred and forty-eight thou&s;and acres, four hundred and eight pari&s;hes, one hundred and &s;ixty-three of which are vicarages, two cities,
<PB N="244" REF="2480">
thirty large towns, eleven hundred and eighty vil|lages, and two hundred and twenty thou&s;and in|habitants. The county &s;ends eighteen members to parliament, viz. two knights for the &s;hires, four members for the cities of Canterbury and Roche&s;ter, four for the towns of Maid&s;tone and Queenborough, and eight for the Cinque-ports, Dover, Sandwich, Hythe, and Romney.</P>

<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>In different parts of the county there is a con|&s;iderable difference in the air. Upon the banks of the Thames, the &s;ea coa&s;t, and Romney-mar&s;h, it is agui&s;h, e&s;pecially to &s;trangers, but in the re&s;t of the county pure and plea&s;ant enough. Hence in the ea&s;t part towards the Downs and Thames, there is &s;aid to be health without wealth; in the Weald, wealth without health; but in the middle and towards London, both health and wealth. The county produces a great variety of valuable articles, and of many of the&s;e, not only enough for its own con&s;umption, but al&s;o a large &s;uperfluity for its neighbours. It abounds in par|ticular with hops and fruit, e&s;pecially cherries and pippins, woods of oak, beech, birch, and che&s;|nuts; cattle, e&s;pecially about Romney-mar&s;h, where the bullocks are large, and the pa&s;ture very luxuriant; mines of iron, pits of chalk and marle, fields of corn, woad, madder, flax, &s;aint|foin, and &s;amphire. Nor is it de&s;titute of &s;heep, deer, rabbits, &s;ea or river fi&s;h, with the la&s;t of which it is &s;upplied from the Thames, Medway, Darent, and Stour.</P>

given it by the Romans, and Durobernia by Bede, which are thought to be derived from Durwhem, &s;ignifying a rapid &s;tream, &s;uch as the Stour, on which it &s;tands, is. The Britons called it Caer-Kent, i. e. the City of Kent, but its pre&s;ent Engli&s;h name is of the &s;ame import, derived from the Saxon. Modern writers in Latin call it Cantuaria. Its great antiquity appears not only from Anto|ninus's Itinerary, but from the military way which has been di&s;covered here, and the cau&s;eways leading to Dover and Lymme, be&s;ides the coins and other curio&s;ities found about it. The archie|pi&s;copal and metropolitical dignity &s;eems to have been &s;ettled here very early, about the beginning of the ninth century, if not &s;ooner; and to prevent its being removed, an anathema was decreed again&s;t any who &s;hould attempt it. After that the city flouri&s;hed greatly, though it &s;uffered in common with other towns during the Dani&s;h inva&s;ions, and at other times by the ca&s;ualties of fires. The city was given intirely to the bi&s;hops by William Rufus, and was held in the utmo&s;t veneration in the popi&s;h times, e&s;pecially after the murder of Becket in the reign of Henry II. to who&s;e &s;hrine &s;o great was the re&s;ort, and &s;o rich the offerings, that Era&s;mus, who was an eye-witne&s;s of its wealth, &s;ays the whole church and chapel in which he was interred glittered with jewels; and at the di&s;&s;olution, the plate and jewels filled two great che&s;ts, each of which required eight &s;trong men to carry out. The cathedral was granted by Ethelbert, king of Kent, upon his conver&s;ion, to Au&s;tin the monk, together with his palace, and the royalty of the city and its territories. This Au&s;tin founded a mona&s;tery for monks, called from him Augu&s;tin. After the cathedral had been &s;everal times de&s;troyed by fire and rebuilt, the pre&s;ent was begun about the year 1174, and augmented and embelli&s;hed
<PB N="246" REF="2510">
by the &s;ucceeding archbi&s;hops, till it was com|pleted in the reign of Henry V. It is a noble Go|thic pile, and before the reformation had thirty|&s;even altars. A great many kings, princes, car|dinals, and archbi&s;hops are buried in it. At the di&s;&s;olution, Henry VIII. &s;eized all the revenues both of the church and mona&s;tery, except what he al|lotted for the maintenance of a dean, twelve pre|bendaries, and &s;ix preachers, whom he e&s;tabli&s;hed in place of the monks. Be&s;ides the cathedral and other churches, as well as a mona&s;tery, the city had antiently a ca&s;tle on the &s;outh-&s;ide, and &s;trong walls, with towers, a ditch, and rampart: it had al&s;o a mint and an exchange. As to its government, it &s;eems to have been intirely &s;ubject to the arch|bi&s;hop, both in &s;pirituals and temporals, at lea&s;t from the time that William Rufus gave it &s;olely to bi&s;hop An&s;elm, till the reformation. It is now a county of it&s;elf, and the corporation con&s;i&s;ts of a mayor, recorder, twelve aldermen, a &s;heriff, twenty-four common-council-men, a mace-bearer, &s;word-bearer, and four &s;erjeants at mace. Every Monday a court is held at Guildhall for civil and criminal cau&s;es; and every other Tue&s;day for the government of the city. With re&s;pect to its pre|&s;ent condition, here are at pre&s;ent no le&s;s than two or three thou&s;and French prote&s;tants em|ployed in the &s;ilk manufacture. Be&s;ides the cathe|dral, it contains fifteen pari&s;h churches, &s;even ho&s;pitals, a free-&s;chool, a hou&s;e of correction, a gaol for criminals, and a &s;umptuous conduit for &s;upplying the inhabitants with water. It con&s;i&s;ts of four &s;treets, di&s;po&s;ed in the form of a cro&s;s, and divided into &s;ix wards, which are about three miles in circumference. It is &s;urrounded on all hands with hop-grounds much to its advantage, and is famed for its excellent brawn. Whoever would be more particularly informed with re&s;pect

<P>Roche&s;ter is an antient city and the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop. Its pre&s;ent name is derived from the Saxon. Tho&s;e by which it was known antiently were, Duro-brus, Duro-brivae, Duro-provae or Duro-brovae, Duro-brovis or Duro-breves, Roibis, and Roffa. It had once a very &s;trong ca&s;tle, built by William the Conqueror. Aethelbert, king of Kent, founded a church in it, and made it an epi&s;co|pal &s;ee. To its cathedral now belong a dean and &s;ix prebendaries. The ca&s;tle, with all its rights and &s;ervices, was granted by James I. to Sir An|thony Weldon, of Swan&s;comb, and his po&s;terity, to whom it has proved a valuable acqui&s;ition; for, upon a certain day, all the tenants of the lands that hold of it by the tenure called ca&s;tle-guard, are obliged to come and pay their quit-rents, or have them doubled for every tide of the Medway which they are ab&s;ent, according to the cu&s;tom of the manor. Here is a very hand&s;ome bridge of twenty-one arches, built in the reign of Henry IV. for the maintenance of which certain lands were granted in the reign of Ri|chard III. and queen Elizabeth. The military way called Watling-&s;treet, pa&s;&s;es through it, com|ing from Blackheath, and extending to Dover. In different parts of the town, there are &s;till &s;ome re|mains of the old wall. Here is a hand&s;ome town|hou&s;e, a mathematical &s;chool founded by Sir Jo|&s;eph William&s;on, plenipotentiary at the treaty of Ry&s;wick, an alms-hou&s;e founded by Mr. Richard Watts, and endowed with &s;ixty pounds a year, and a hand&s;ome charity-&s;chool. There is an oy&s;|ter-fi&s;hery in the Medway, &s;ubject to the magi&s;tracy of the city, who hold a court on that account,
<PB N="248" REF="2530">
called the admiralty-court. Every one who has &s;erved &s;even years apprentice&s;hip to a dredger|man, and obtained a licence from the court, for which he pays &s;ix &s;hillings and eight pence yearly, has a right to fi&s;h. The court has authority to appoint the time when oy&s;ters are to be taken, the quantity to be taken, the places where they are to be taken, and to puni&s;h offenders, and &s;uch as pre&s;ume to fi&s;h without being duly qualified. The city con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of one broad ill-built &s;treet, and is governed by a mayor, recorder, twelve aldermen, of whom the mayor is one, twelve common-council-men, a town-clerk, three &s;erjeants at mace, and a water-bailiff. It has given the title of earl to &s;everal families, but la&s;t to that of Hyde, de&s;cended from the earl of Clarendon. The &s;ee is the mo&s;t antient one in England next to that of Canterbury.</P>
<P>Maid&s;tone is generally &s;tiled the county-town, the a&s;&s;izes being mo&s;tly, and the other courts always, held here. The knights of the &s;hire al&s;o are cho&s;en, and one of the public gaols, with the &s;tandard of weights and mea&s;ures by act of par|liament, are kept in it. Mr. Cambden thinks it is the Roman &s;tation Vagniacum, upon the river Va|ga, or Medway. The Britons called it Caer-Med|way, or Megwag, and the Saxons Medweg&s;tone, from which the pre&s;ent name &s;eems derived. It has been a con&s;iderable town ever &s;ince the time of the Romans, having been much favoured by the archbi&s;hops of Canterbury, who&s;e peculiar the pa|ri&s;h is, and &s;erved by their curate. There were once two colleges, and a palace built by them here; and the fine &s;tone bridge little inferior to that of Roche&s;ter, was erected by them. Edward VI. made it a mayor-town; queen Mary disfranchi&s;ed it for its adherence to Sir Thomas Wyat, who was lord of the manor, but queen Elizabeth incorporated it again. It is governed at pre|&s;ent
<PB N="249" REF="2540">
by a mayor, recorder, twelve a&s;&s;i&s;tants, call|ed jurats, and twenty - four commoners. The earls of Winchel&s;ea are lords of the manor, it having been granted to their progenetrix, the lady of Sir Moyle Finch, by James I. with the title of vi&s;counte&s;s Maid&s;tone. It is a large popu|lous plea&s;ant town, trading chiefly in hops and linen thread, of which, and likewi&s;e timber, wheat, apples, cherries, a &s;ort of paving-&s;tone, very durable, and white &s;and, it &s;ends great quan|tities to London, the Medway being navigable hi|ther by barges and hoys of fifty or &s;ixty tons. The London market is al&s;o &s;upplied from hence with Kenti&s;h bullocks from the weald of Kent, which begins not far from the town. The adjacent country is extremely fertile and beautiful, full of villages and gentlemen's &s;eats.</P>
<P>Old-Rumney, or Romeney, was formerly called Romenal, and from its name is thought to have been a work of the Romans. It was a con&s;idera|ble place, till the reign of Edward I. when its harbour was de&s;erted by the &s;ea, &s;ince which pe|riod it has been decaying. New-Rumney, which is one of the Cinque-ports, and with its members Old - Romney, Dangemar&s;h, A&s;ward&s;tone, and Broomhill, is bound, by the con&s;titution of the&s;e ports, to fit out five&s;hips of war. The town is hand|&s;ome and plea&s;antly &s;ituated upon a gravelly-hill. Here the two great meetings for all the Cinque|ports, called Ge&s;ling, are held yearly. The ma|gi&s;trates of the town were once called barons, but are now &s;tiled a mayor and jurats. Its chief trade is grazing cattle in the mar&s;h, which, according to Cambden, is fourteen miles long and eight broad, and, it is probable, was once covered by the &s;ea. Tho' the air is unwhole&s;ome, yet the &s;oil is very rich, and the pa&s;ture &s;o luxuriant, that the &s;heep and bullocks fed here are reckoned the large&s;t in
<PB N="250" REF="2550">
England, and &s;o numerous, that they contribute greatly to the &s;upplying the London markets. It contains forty-four thou&s;and acres, two towns, and nineteen pari&s;hes, which, in order to promote the draining, &s;ettling, and cultivating, were encor|porated by Edward IV. by the name of the bailiff, jurats, and commonalty of Rumney-mar&s;h, and had great privileges and immunities be&s;towed upon them, &s;uch as &s;carce any other corporation in Eng|land enjoys. Laws al&s;o are e&s;tabli&s;hed among them, called the &s;tatutes of Sewers, by which all the low grounds from the i&s;le of Thanet to Peven&s;ey in Su&s;&s;ex are governed. In this, as in mo&s;t other mar&s;hes, great trees are often found under ground.</P>
<P>Hythe is another of the Cinque-ports. Its name, in the Saxon, &s;ignifies a port, tho' it now hardly de&s;erves the name, being choaked up in a great mea&s;ure with &s;and. It took its ri&s;e from We&s;t-Hythe, and that from Limme, both which fell &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to decay, upon the &s;ea retiring from them. It was incorporated by queen Elizabeth by the name of a mayor, jurats, and commonalty. Here are two ho&s;pitals, and antiently there were five churches, but now only one; under which, in a vault, is a huge pile of gigantic human &s;kulls and bones, &s;aid to have been tho&s;e of Danes &s;lain in a battle near the town.</P>
<P>Dover is called Dubris in the Itinerary. Its pre&s;ent name is thought to be derived from the Briti&s;h Dufyrrha, &s;ignifying a &s;teep place. It is al&s;o one of the Cinque-ports, and was bound for|merly to find twenty-one &s;hips for the wars, when it had a large convenient harbour, of which little remains. What it is chiefly noted for now is, its being the &s;tation of the packet-boats for France and Flanders, and the port where pa&s;&s;engers com|monly take &s;hipping for France, the channel being narrowe&s;t at this place. On a hill, or rather rock,
<PB N="251" REF="2560">
on the right-hand, overlooking the &s;ea, &s;tands Dover-ca&s;tle, &s;o large that it looks like a little city. It is thought to have been fir&s;t built by the Romans, by whom, when the empire began to decline, a company of Tungrians was placed here in garri&s;on, a part of who&s;e arms were tho&s;e mira|culous arrows formerly &s;hewn in the ca&s;tle. From that time &s;carce any notice was taken of it or the town, till a little before the conque&s;t, when it was look|ed upon as the key of England. After the con|que&s;t, large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were a&s;&s;igned by the Con|queror to his nobles in Kent, upon condition that they &s;hould repair to its defence with a certain number of men, whenever there was occa&s;ion; but in&s;tead of this they afterwards paid a &s;tipulated &s;um of money. It is too high to hurt or annoy any &s;hip at &s;ea, and could not &s;tand a &s;iege now half a day. In it is a well &s;ixty fathom deep, the work of Julius Cae&s;ar, and now called Wat|&s;on's cellar, whence the water is drawn by a wheel. There is al&s;o an old church, &s;aid to have been erected by Lucius, the fir&s;t chri&s;tian king of Bri|tain, which is a very great curio&s;ity, and a Ro|man pharos or watch-tower. The royal palace, chapel, and offices, appear from their ruins to have been exceeding grand. Upon another rock over again&s;t it are the remains of an antient building called Briden&s;tone, and &s;uppo&s;ed to have been a watch-tower to direct &s;ailors by night-lights. In this town the lord-warden of the Cinque-ports is now &s;worn, the courts held, and mo&s;t of the bu&s;i|ne&s;s relating to the Cinque-ports in general tran&s;|acted. Here is al&s;o a cu&s;tom-hou&s;e and victualling-office. The &s;ituation of the town is very romantic, in a valley between lofty cliffs. It is governed by a mayor and jurats, and was incorporated in Edward the Confe&s;&s;or's time. Its members are Folk&s;tone, Fever&s;ham, St. John's, St. Peter's,
<PB N="252" REF="2570">
Birchington, King&s;down, and Ring&s;wold. The town was antiently walled, had nine gates, and &s;even churches, five of which have been de&s;troyed. Tho' great &s;ums of money were expended upon the harbour in Henry VIII. queen Elizabeth, and king William's reigns, yet it will now admit only &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, and that only at high-water. Each of the twenty-one wards, into which the town was antiently divided, had a licen&s;ed packet-boat: and in the reign of Richard II. the fare was, for a &s;ingle per&s;on in &s;ummer, &s;ix-pence, in winter one &s;hilling; for a hor&s;e in &s;ummer one &s;hilling and &s;ix-pence, and in winter two &s;hillings. It now gives the title of duke to the family of Douglas in Scotland.</P>
<P>Sandwich is another of the Cinque-ports, who&s;e members are Fordwick, Deal, Warmar, Ram&s;|gate, Stonar, Sar, and Brightling&s;ey. It &s;tands at the bottom of a bay, near the mouth of the Stour, was formerly walled, and one of the chief ports of England, being obliged to &s;end five &s;hips for the king's wars, armed and equipped with twenty men each, which they were to maintain fifteen days, and after that by the king. The Pro|tus Rutupen&s;is, or Statio Rutupece, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;tood near this &s;pot, whence the Romans u&s;ed to &s;ail to the continent, and where they fir&s;t landed. It is &s;aid to have paid formerly forty pounds, and forty thou&s;and herrings to the archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury, yearly. Here Canute the Dane &s;lit the no&s;es, and cut off the hands of the Engli&s;h ho&s;tages. The town is governed by a mayor, jurats, and common|council, has three churches, as many ho&s;pitals, a free-&s;chool, whence two &s;cholars have exhibi|tions in Lincoln-college, Oxford, a good cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, and key; but the harbour is &s;o choaked up, that it will admit none but &s;mall ve&s;&s;els. There is a manufacture of cloth in the town; but their
<PB N="253" REF="2580">
chief trade is in &s;hipping and malting. It gives the title of earl to the family of Montague.</P>
<P>Queenborough was built by Edward III. and called Queenborough in honour of his queen. He made it a corporation by the name of mayor and ju|rats, be&s;towed a great many privileges upon it, and &s;ecured it with a ca&s;tle: yet it is now but a poor mean place, its inhabitants being mo&s;tly fi&s;her|men, tho' &s;till a corporation, and &s;ends mem|bers to parliament. It &s;tands on the we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land of Sheppey.</P>
<P>This i&s;land, formed by the &s;ea and the river Medway, the two mouths of which are called the Ea&s;t and We&s;t-Swale, is twenty miles in compa&s;s, and took its name from the great flocks of &s;heep con&s;tantly fed upon it. This i&s;land la|bours under a &s;earcity of wood and fre&s;h water, but is fruitful in corn. All over the i&s;land are tumuli or barrows, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been rai&s;ed over Dani&s;h officers, it having been long infe&s;ted by the&s;e people. The u&s;ual pa&s;&s;age from here to Kent, is at King's-ferry, where people are wafted over by means of a rope extended acro&s;s the river, and &s;ecured at both ends. No toll is paid except on Sundays and certain holidays, the expence of which, a cau&s;eway leading to it, and a wall to keep out the &s;ea, being all defrayed by a trifling tax, that the landholders of the i&s;le impo&s;e upon them&s;elves, at the rate of a penny for an acre of fre&s;h land, and another for every ten of &s;alt-mar&s;h-land. The i&s;le is much vi&s;ited by botani&s;ts, on account of the great number of marine plants that grow in the mar&s;hes. In this i&s;land, at the mouth of the Med|way, &s;tands Sheerne&s;s-fort, a &s;trong and regular fortification, built by Charles II. to defend the river, and prevent &s;uch a di&s;a&s;ter as happened in
<PB N="254" REF="2590">
1667, when the Dutch &s;ailed up the Medway, and committed &s;uch deva&s;tation. The town is a neat little place, where is a yard and dock for building and repairing fifth and &s;ixth rates, frigates, and yachts. The river from hence to Roche&s;ter is very broad and deep, and makes a very noble &s;afe harbour for the large&s;t men of war. On both &s;hores of the Medway al&s;o, for further &s;e|curity, are two ca&s;tles, called Upnor and Gilling|ham, both well &s;upplied with guns.</P>
<P>Chatham, which is a continuation of Roche&s;ter, was founded by Charles II. after the Dutch-war, and has been ever &s;ince a celebrated &s;tation of the royal navy. Here is every requi&s;ite for building, repairing, rigging, cleaning, and laying up &s;hips of war; as docks, yards, launches, forges, founde|ries, warehou&s;es, and &s;torehou&s;es, in which there are &s;uch immen&s;e quantities of naval &s;tores, and di&s;po&s;ed in &s;uch order, as is really amazing. Two commi&s;&s;ioners, and other officers, con&s;tantly re&s;ide here, to take care of the &s;tores and works, and give nece&s;&s;ary orders. As the public buildings are &s;ur|pri&s;ingly large and &s;tately, &s;o are the private hou&s;es in general very neat and commodious. The town gives title of earl to the late right honourable William Pitt, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>. The charity, called the Che&s;t, for the relief of wounded and di&s;abled &s;eamen, was e&s;tabli&s;hed after the defeat of the Spani&s;h ar|mada, in the reign of queen Elizabeth, by Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Hawkins, who en|gaged the &s;eamen then in the queen's &s;ervice to allow a &s;mall portion of their pay for that pur|po&s;e; and this, having been approved of by the go|vernment, has been continued ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>Stroud &s;tands on the other &s;ide the river, clo&s;e to Roche&s;ter-bridge, and with Chatham and Ro|che&s;ter form almo&s;t one continued town. It was
<PB N="255" REF="2600">
a manor formerly belonging to the Knights-Tem|plars, to whom Henry III. granted it.</P>
<P>Lewi&s;ham is only a village, yet often men|tioned in hi&s;tory on account of &s;ome memorable incidents. In this place, in the reign of Charles II. an alms-hou&s;e, and two free-&s;chools, one for Engli&s;h, and the other for Latin, with a mainte|nance for &s;ome of the &s;cholars at the univer&s;ity, were founded by Abraham Colf, mini&s;ter of the pari&s;h, who appointed the leather-&s;ellers company in London governors of them.</P>
<P>At Bromley is a palace of the bi&s;hops of Roche&s;ter, to whom, in the year 700, king Edgar gave the manor; and here, in the reign of Charles II. Warner, bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, founded an ho&s;pi|tal for twenty poor widows of clergymen, to whom he allowed twenty pounds a-year, and fifty pounds to a chaplain.</P>
<P>Eltham had formerly a royal palace, which, &s;uch are the changes and revolutions that time brings about, is now a barn belonging to a farmer in the village. It &s;eems to have been very large and magnificent, with &s;pacious gardens, and a broad deep moat running round it. Edward II. generally re&s;ided here, and his queen was deli|vered of a &s;on at this place, called John of El|tham. The crown-lands are now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sir John Shaw, baronet. It is a neat village, a con&s;iderable thoroughfare, and gives title of earl to his royal highne&s;s the prince of Wales.</P>
<P>Sevenoak, or Sennock, is &s;aid to have had its name from &s;even oaks of extraordinary height that grew there formerly. Sir Humphry Stafford was defeated near this place by Jack Cade and his fol|lowers, in the reign of Hen. VI. and here Sir William Sevenoake, who is &s;aid to have been a foundling, &s;upported and educated by a charitable per&s;on of
<PB N="256" REF="2610">
the town, from which he had his name, but ro&s;e afterwards to be lord-mayor of London, founded, out of gratitude, a &s;chool and ho&s;pital. The town is governed by a warden and a&s;&s;i&s;tants, and &s;tands on the river Darent.</P>
<P>Dartford is a contraction of Darentford, the town being &s;ituated upon the Darent, which is navigable for barges, and has &s;everal paper, powder, and other mills on it. The fir&s;t mill for making paper, and al&s;o for &s;litting iron bars to make wire, was erected on the river by Sir John Spelman, in the reign of Charles II. At this place the rebellion rai&s;ed by Wat Tyler and Jack Straw, in the time of Richard II. began; and here Edward III. built a nunnery, which Henry VIII. converted into a palace. The town is a great thoroughfare on the road to Dover and Can|terbury, and has a good market for corn. Upon a little river that falls into the Darent below this town, &s;tands St. Mary's-Cray, Paul's-Cray, Foot's-Cray, North-Cray, and Crayford, all which de|rive their name from the river, which was an|tiently called Creece, but now Crouch. At Crayford the Britons were totally defeated by Hengi&s;t the Saxon; in con&s;equence of which victory he found|ed the kingdom of Kent. In the heath and fields in the neighbourhood of the &s;ame place are many caves, narrow at top and wide at the bottom, in which the Saxons &s;ecreted their wives, children, and effects, when at war with the Britons.</P>
<P>Tunbridge has its name from the bridge over the Tun, one of the branches of the Medway. Here was antiently a ca&s;tle built by Richard de Clare, who had the manor in lieu of Briony in Normandy, of which his grandfather Godfrey, a natural &s;on of Richard I. duke of Normandy, had been earl. But the earls of Glouce&s;ter, his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors,
<PB N="257" REF="2620">
held it afterwards of the archbi&s;hops of Canterbury. A free-&s;chool was erected here by Sir Andrew Judd, a native of the place; and cer|tain lands and tenements &s;ettled on it by act of parliament, in the reign of queen Elizabeth. From hence the earls of Rochford derive the title of vi&s;count. In the pari&s;h, only four miles from the town, are the &s;o much celebrated wells, who&s;e waters are very efficacious in cold chronical di&s;ea&s;es, weak nerves, and bad dige&s;tion. They are much frequented in the months of June, July, and Au|gu&s;t, both for health and plea&s;ure. At the prin|cipal well are paved walks, of which one is co|vered for the mu&s;ic to play, and the company to walk in, in wet weather, be&s;ides the long-rooms, &s;hops, coffee-rooms, gardens, bowling greens, a chapel, and market. There are balls four times a week; and it is ob&s;erved that they who have no|thing to do any where el&s;e, are the bu&s;ie&s;t here. The air of the place is exceeding good, and pro|vi&s;ions, whether butchers-meat, fi&s;h, wild or tame fowl, in great plenty and perfection. The company divert them&s;elves with walking, dancing, bowling, card-playing, raffling, tea-drinking, dre&s;&s;ing, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Lenham is thought by Cambden to be the Durolenum or Durolevum of Antoninus. In the church is the tomb of Robert Thomp&s;on, e&s;quire, the grandchild of Mary Honeywood, who, as appears from the epitaph, had three hun|dred and &s;ixty-&s;even children, lawfully de&s;cended from her, &s;ixteen of her own body, one hundred and fourteen grand-children, two hundred and twenty-eight in the third generation, and nine in the fourth.</P>
<P>Sittingbourn lies in the lathe of Scray. Being a con&s;iderable thoroughfare, it has &s;everal inns, of which the Red Lion is remarkable for an enter|tainment
<PB N="258" REF="2630">
given in it to Henry V. when he re|turned from France, which, though then counted an elegant one, co&s;t only nine &s;hillings and nine|pence, wine being at one penny a pint, and other things proportionably cheap. Teynham, in this neighbourhood, gives the title of baron to a de|&s;cendant of Sir John Roper, who was the fir&s;t man in the county that proclaimed James I. and on that account was created baron of Teyn|ham.</P>
<P>Wye &s;tands on the Stour, which is navigable hitherfor barges. At this place Edward II. kept his Chri&s;tmas before his coronation, and after he had buried his father, the manor then belonging to the crown; and here Kemp, archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury, built a collegiate church, the lands of which are now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the earl of Win|chel&s;ea, who is lord of the royal manor of Wye. The lady Thornhill, to erect and endow a charity-&s;chool, left two thou&s;and five hundred pounds.</P>
<P>A&s;hford. The manor of this town belonged antiently to the dean and canons of We&s;tmin&s;ter. It &s;tands on the road from London to Hythe, is governed by a mayor, and has a court of record once in three weeks, for all actions of debt or da|mages, not exceeding twenty marks. It has al&s;o a free grammar-&s;chool, and a market every Tue&s;|day fortnight.</P>
<P>Dimchurch. By a &s;tatute of Edward III. the corporation of Rumney-mar&s;h are to meet here fifteen days after Michaelmas, to &s;ettle all diffe|rences, enforce the execution of the mar&s;h-laws, and enact new ones for the general intere&s;t and be|nefit of the community. Here al&s;o the courts for the lathe, and the records of Rumney-mar&s;h, are kept.</P>
<P>Folk&s;tone is a member of the Cinque-port of Dover, and by the coins and other antiquities
<PB N="259" REF="2640">
found about it, appears to be antient. It had for|merly a watch-tower upon a hill, &s;till called Ca&s;tle-hill, a fort built in 1068, the ruins of which are &s;till vi&s;ible, as well as a nunnery. The town is in|corporated by the name of mayor, jurats, and com|monalty, has a harbour for &s;mall &s;hips, and the inha|bitants, who are mo&s;tly fi&s;hermen, are employed, in the different &s;ea&s;ons, in catching mackarel for London, and herrings for the merchants of Yar|mouth and Leo&s;toff. There are about three hundred fi&s;hing-boats or &s;macks belonging to it. In this town the celebrated Dr. Harvey, who di&s;covered the circulation of the blood, was born; and here Sir Eliab Harvey endowed a charity-&s;chool.</P>
<P>Sandgate-ca&s;tle &s;tands a little to the &s;outh of Folk&s;tone, upon the &s;ea-&s;hore. It was built by Henry VIII. at the expence of five thou&s;and pounds. There are now a few guns mounted on it to protect the harbour and fi&s;hermen of Folke|&s;tone.</P>
<P>The head-lands upon this coa&s;t, called the South and North Foreland, are the two mo&s;t ea&s;|terly points of Kent, and the bay between them is called the Downs. This would be a very dangerous road for &s;hips, were it not pretty well &s;heltered by two head-lands and the Goodwin-&s;ands, which run for about three leagues parallel to the &s;hore, and at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from it: yet &s;hips are &s;till expo&s;ed to great danger in hard gales at &s;outh-ea&s;t, ea&s;t-by-north, or ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Tenterden is an antient town, governed by a mayor and jurats. It has a free-&s;chool, but is mo&s;t remarkable for the lofty &s;teeple of its church, which, it is pretended, was by accident the cau&s;e of the Goodwin-&s;ands: for the abbot of St. Au|gu&s;tin, near Canterbury, who was rector of the pari&s;h, being &s;o intent upon the building this
<PB N="260" REF="2650">
&s;teeple, as to neglect the wall by which that tract of land, now called the Goodwin-&s;ands, was guarded from the &s;ea, it was &s;o overflowed, that it could never afterwards be recovered.</P>
<P>Deal. Julius Cae&s;ar, who landed here in his de&s;cent upon Britain, calls it Dola. On each &s;ide the town is a ca&s;tle built by Henry VIII. to com|mand the road, viz. Sandown on the north, and Wilmar on the &s;outh. It is now a hand&s;ome thriving town, in con&s;equence of the great re&s;ort of &s;eamen to it from the Downs: be&s;ides, it carries on &s;ome foreign trade, and mo&s;t &s;hips bound to or from London &s;top at it, either to take in fre&s;h provi&s;ions, receive or di&s;patch letters from and to their owners and merchants, or &s;et pa&s;&s;engers on &s;hore.</P>
<P>Margate, otherwi&s;e called St. John's, is a mem|ber of the town and port of Dover. Here king William frequently landed in his return from the continent, as pa&s;&s;engers do &s;till when the wind does not &s;erve for the Thames. It has a good bay for ve&s;&s;els to ride in, and a large pier, maintained by a duty on all goods &s;hipped or landed there, whence a great deal of corn, chiefly the pro|duce of the i&s;land, is exported. It was, till of late, a poor place, inhabited chiefly by fi&s;hermen and mariners; but has been for &s;ome time &s;o much frequented for bathing in the &s;ea, either for health or plea&s;ure, that its condition is much altered for the better; for here are now &s;everal bathing-rooms, a parade, a&s;&s;embly-room, playhou&s;e, and &s;ome good inns. Two phy&s;icians u&s;ually re&s;ide in it during the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on. Hoys go regularly once a week between London and Margate, and pa&s;&s;engers pay half a crown, be&s;ides a trifle for their baggage. Near this town is the North Foreland and a light-hou&s;e, on the top of which a fire is kept blazing all night, for the direction of
<PB N="261" REF="2660">
mariners. Here was fought a bloody battle be|twixt the Danes and Saxons about the year 853, in the reign of Ethelwolf. On the field of battle are &s;till two barrows, the tombs, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed, of &s;ome of the Dani&s;h officers. This town is &s;itu|ated in the i&s;le of Thanet, formed by the &s;ea and the river Want&s;um, which is eight miles in length, four in breadth, and very fruitful in corn and gra&s;s. When Vortigern, the Briti&s;h king, &s;ent for the Saxons to a&s;&s;i&s;t him again&s;t the Scots and Picts, he gave them this i&s;le; and here the Danes fir&s;t landed and began their depredations. Though there are fifteen or &s;ixteen hundred fa|milies upon the i&s;land, it is &s;aid there is hardly a gentleman's hou&s;e in it. At the North Foreland, on the north ea&s;t of it, the mouth of the Thames on this &s;ide begins, as it does on the other at the Na&s;e in E&s;&s;ex. The principal place is Ram&s;|gate, where a noble pier is now building; and where the inhabitants pretend that Julius Cae&s;ar fir&s;t landed: whence its true name, as they alledge, is Roman&s;gate.</P>
<P>Fever&s;ham is a very antient town; for in a char|ter of king Kenulf's, anno 802, it is called the King's little town. In the reign of king Athel|&s;tan, anno 903, a great council was held in it, and &s;everal laws enacted. Here was al&s;o a mitred abbey erected by king Stephen, in which he, with Maud his queen, and Eu&s;tace his &s;on, was bu|ried. It now belongs to the marquis of Rocking|ham. The town is a corporation by the name of the mayor, jurats, and commonalty. It lies upon a creek of the Ea&s;t Swale, navigable for hoys and lighters; and the country about it is exceeding fruitful, e&s;pecially in apples and cherries. The principal bu&s;ine&s;s of the town is fi&s;hing for oy&s;ters, of which the Dutch take great quantities, to the amount of two or three thou&s;and pounds yearly,
<PB N="262" REF="2670">
be&s;ides what they di&s;po&s;e of at home: but this trade is attended with a great di&s;advantage, prodigi|ous quantities of wine, coffee, tea, brandy, and pep|per, being brought over by the Dutch from France and Holland, which are run by the fi&s;hermen, and a part exchanged for wool. It was here that James II. was &s;topped when he was going to France, af|ter the prince of Orange had landed; and the ge|neral of his army, a brother of the family of Du|ras, in France, had the title of earl from this town.</P>
<P>Milton, or Middleton, has its name from its be|ing &s;ituated in the middle of the county, between the Downs and Deptford, and is particularly fa|mous for its delicate oy&s;ters. It is a large town &s;ituated among the creeks of the Ea&s;t Swale, and has a good market for corn and fruit. The ma|nor belongs to the earl of Pembroke. The kings of Kent had a palace here antiently, which was burnt down by earl Goodwin, in Edward the Con|fe&s;&s;or's time. The town has a harbour for barges, and is governed by a port-reve, who &s;upervi&s;es all the weights and mea&s;ures of the hundred. Not far from the town are the remains of a fortification erected by king Alfred, called Bernard-ca&s;tle, and of another by Ha&s;tings the pirate, called Ca&s;tle-ruff.</P>
<P>Grave&s;end is a noted town upon the Thames, oppo&s;ite Tilbury-fort, in E&s;&s;ex. It was plun|dered and burnt in the reign of Richard II. by the French and Spaniards; on which account Ri|chard, at the reque&s;t of the abbot of St. Mary le Grace, on Tower-hill, to whom he had granted a manor there called Parrocks, ve&s;ted it with the &s;ole privilege of carrying pa&s;&s;engers from thence to London by water. The town is &s;urrounded with garden-grounds, which are noted for the excel|lent a&s;paragus they produce. All outward-bound
<PB N="263" REF="2680">
&s;hips are obliged to come to an anchor here, till they have been vi&s;ited and examined by the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers; and here they generally take in provi&s;ions. The place thrives a-pace, in con&s;e|quence of its being continually crowded with &s;ea|men belonging to the &s;hipping riding at anchor before it. Here is a blockhou&s;e well mounted with cannon to command the &s;hips and river. Milton and Grave&s;end are a corporation by the name of mayor, jurats, and inhabitants of both towns. The fare in the tilt-boat is now nine-pence a-head, and one &s;hilling in the wherry. The former mu&s;t not take in above forty pa&s;&s;engers, and the latter no more than ten. Both at Billing&s;gate and Grave&s;end, a bell is rung for fifteen minutes at high-water, by night and day, to give notice to the tilt-boats and wherries to put off. Coaches al&s;o ply at Grave&s;end to carry pa&s;&s;engers to Roche&s;ter. Here is a very hand&s;ome charitable foundation, Mr. Henry Pinnock, having, in 1624, given two dwelling-hou&s;es, and a hou&s;e for a ma&s;ter-weaver to employ the poor; and a good e&s;tate is al&s;o &s;ettled for the repairs. Swan&s;comb, near Grave&s;|end, is &s;aid to have derived its name from Swain, king of Denmark, he having encamped there al|ter landing from the Thames.</P>
<P>Woolwich is almo&s;t entirely made up of docks, yards, and &s;torehou&s;es, with the hou&s;es of the of|ficers belonging to them and the ordnance. There are immen&s;e &s;tores of timber, plank, ma&s;ts, pitch, tar, &amp;c. for the u&s;e of the royal navy. There is al&s;o a &s;pacious rope-walk for making ca|bles and cordage; and in the lower part of the town is the gun-yard or warren, where is a prodi|gious magazine of artillery, mortars, bomb-&s;hells, carca&s;es, granadoes, &amp;c. The Thames is here &s;o broad and deep, that the large&s;t men of war may ride with &s;afety even at low-water. At this
<PB N="264" REF="2690">
place is an academy, in which young gentlemen are taught navigation, gunnery, and fortification, and thereby qualified to make able engineers, and officers in the navy.</P>
<P>Greenwich is very plea&s;antly &s;ituated upon the bank of the Thames. In this town was formerly a royal palace, built by Humphrey, duke of Glou|ce&s;ter, enlarged by Henry VII. and completed by Henry VIII. who often re&s;ided there, as did queen Mary and queen Elizabeth, who were al&s;o born in it; and it was here Edward VI. died. Near the town is a park planted and walled in by Charles II. with a hill in the middle, whence there is a noble pro&s;pect of London, the Thames, and &s;hipping; al&s;o a royal ob&s;ervatory furni&s;hed with a complete &s;et of in&s;truments for a&s;tronomi|cal ob&s;ervations. But the glory of Greenwich is the ho&s;pital for di&s;abled and &s;uperannuated &s;eamen, their widows, and children. It is a very noble &s;tructure, the wing next London being part of the palace that king Charles II. intended to have erected, and which co&s;t him thirty-&s;ix thou&s;and pounds, being finely adorned with all the deco|rations of painting, &s;culpture, and architecture. About two thou&s;and old di&s;abled &s;eamen are main|tained in it. The nur&s;es, who mu&s;t be &s;eamen's widows, have ten pounds a year, and &s;uch as at|tend the infirmary, two &s;hillings a week more. Be&s;ides private benefactions to the amount of about &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds, the parliament, in the year 1732, &s;ettled the earl of Derwentwater's e&s;tate up|on the ho&s;pital to the yearly value of &s;ix thou&s;and pounds. The hall of the ho&s;pital is finely painted by Sir James Thornhill. All &s;trangers who &s;ee it pay two pence each, and this income is applied to the &s;upport of the mathematical &s;chool for the &s;ons of &s;ailors. For the better &s;upport of this ho&s;pital,
<PB N="265" REF="2700">
every &s;eaman in the royal navy, and in the mer|chants &s;ervice, pays &s;ixpence a month, &s;topped out of their pay, and delivered in at the &s;ixpenny receivers office on Tower-hill: on which account a &s;eaman, who can produce an authentic certificate of his being di&s;abled and rendered unfit for &s;ervice, by defending any &s;hip belonging to his maje&s;ty's Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, or in taking any &s;hip from the enemy, may be admitted into this ho&s;pital, and receive the &s;ame benefit from it, as if he had been in his maje&s;ty's immediate &s;ervice. Be&s;ides the &s;eamen and widows mentioned above, about one hundred boys, the &s;ons of &s;eamen, are in|&s;tructed in navigation, and bred up for the &s;er|vice of the royal navy; but there are no out-pen|&s;ioners, as at Chel&s;ea. Each of the mariners has a weekly allowance of bread, beef, mutton, pea&s;e, chee&s;e, butter, and beer, and one &s;hilling a week tobacco-money. The tobacco-money of the boat-&s;wains is two &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence a week each; that of their mates one &s;hilling and &s;ixpence; and that of the other officers in proportion to their rank. Each common pen&s;ioner al&s;o, once in two years, has a &s;uit of blue cloaths, a hat, three pair of &s;tockings, two pair of &s;hoes, five neck|cloths, three &s;hirts, and two night-caps. The principal officers of the hou&s;e are a governor, lieu|tenant-governor, trea&s;urer, three captains, &s;ix lieu|tenants, two chaplains, a phy&s;ician and &s;urgeon, a clerk of the checque, and an auditor, who have hand&s;ome &s;alaries. In this town are al&s;o two charity-&s;chools, the one endowed with four hun|dred pounds a year, for twenty boys, of which the drapers company of London are managers, and the other with ninety-five pounds a year, for twenty-eight boys under the care of the vicar, church-wardens, and over&s;eers. In the reign of James I. the earl of Northampton, brother to the duke
<PB N="266" REF="2710">
of Norfolk, founded and endowed an ho&s;pital for twenty old decayed hou&s;ekeepers, which is commonly called the duke of Norfolk's college, and committed to the care of the mercers com|pany in London. Many of the inhabitants of the town are per&s;ons of note and fa&s;hion, who have &s;erved abroad in our fleets and armies. The pro|fits of the market belong to this ho&s;pital, who&s;e governors have the direction of it. It is remark|able, that the fir&s;t ho&s;pital that was founded by an Engli&s;h prote&s;tant, was here in 1560, by Mr. Lambard, author of the Perambulation of Kent, for twenty poor. Blackheath, in the neigh|bourhood of this town, has been the &s;cene not only of many robberies, but the rendezvous of many rebel armies: for here, in the reign of Ri|chard II. Wat Tyler drew up a hundred thou&s;and men, Jack Cade encamped on it in that of Henry VI. and in Henry VII's time, two thou&s;and Cor|ni&s;h rebeis were defeated. On the &s;outh &s;ide of the heath &s;tands Morden-college, founded by Sir John Morden, baronet, for the reception of hone&s;t old merchants, not under &s;ixty years of age, who have twenty pounds a year each. The num|ber of pen&s;ioners was intended to be forty, which the hou&s;e will accommodate; but at pre&s;ent there are not quite &s;o many. It is under the direc|tion of &s;even Turkey merchants, who fill up the vacancies that happen among the pen&s;ioners. The college has a chaplain, who reads prayers twice a-day, and preaches twice on Sunday, for which he has &s;ixty pounds a-year. Adjoining to the college is a burial-place for the pen|&s;ioners.</P>
<P>Charlton, a plea&s;ant village on the north-&s;ide of the heath, noted for a fair, which is of a very &s;ingular nature, called Horn-fair: for on St. Luke's-day, on which it is held, a great mob, in
<PB N="267" REF="2720">
con&s;equence of a printed &s;ummons di&s;per&s;ed thro' town and country &s;ome days before, a&s;&s;emble at a place called Cuckold's-point, beyond Rother|hithe, whence they march in proce&s;&s;ion with horns on their heads thro' Deptford and Greenwich to Charlton, where the fair is kept, in which the chief articles for &s;ale are different &s;orts of wares made of horn. It u&s;ed formerly to be a &s;cene of the mo&s;t unbounded licentiou&s;ne&s;s and ob&s;cenity; but of late it hath been reduced to a little more order and decency. Tradition gives this account of its origin: King John, while he was hunting hereabouts, having been &s;eparated from his at|tendants, &s;tepped into a cottage, where he found only a woman, with who&s;e beauty being capti|vated, he prevailed upon her to gratify his pa&s;&s;ion, tho' &s;he was married; but having been &s;urpri&s;ed in the mid&s;t of his amorous tran&s;ports by the hu&s;|band, the king di&s;covered him&s;elf, and pacified his rage by pre&s;ents, a grant of the hamlet, and all the land from thence to Cuckold's-point; and the hu&s;band, to perpetuate the memory of this adven|ture, by which he was &s;uch a gainer, and which, no doubt, greatly flattered both his own and his wife's vanity, e&s;tabli&s;hed, with the king con&s;ent, a fair for horns upon the &s;pot.</P>
<P>Deptford is the la&s;t town of the county towards London. It had its name from a deep ford over the river Raven&s;bourn, where the bridge now &s;tands. It is a large populous town, containing about one thou&s;and hou&s;es, and is the &s;eat of the corporation, guild, or brotherhood of the mariners of England, e&s;tabli&s;hed in the reign of Henry VIII. called Trinity-hou&s;e of Deptford|&s;trond, of which we gave &s;ome account already in our de&s;cription of Stepney-pari&s;h in Middle&s;ex. There are two ho&s;pitals, the one con&s;i&s;ting of
<PB N="268" REF="2730">
thirty-eight, and the other of twenty-one hou&s;es, for decayed pilots, ma&s;ters of &s;hips, and their widows, in which the men are allowed twenty &s;hillings, and the women &s;ixteen &s;hillings per month. But this town is chiefly di&s;tingui&s;hed by its noble dock and yard, which, like the others we have already de&s;cribed, are furni&s;hed with all the conveniences and &s;tores requi&s;ite for building, equipping, repairing, and laying up &s;hips of war. The town is now enlarged to &s;uch a degree, that it is, in a manner, joined to Rotherhithe. The yard, with the &s;tore-hou&s;es, docks, and officers hou&s;es, take up a con&s;iderable part of the town. The royal yachts are generally kept here; and near the dock is the &s;eat of Sir John Evelyn, called Say's-court, where Peter the Great, czar of Mu&s;covy, re&s;ided, while he attended the yard, to complete his knowledge in the practical part of naval architecture.</P>

<P>The antiquities of Kent, be&s;ides tho&s;e already mentioned, are a fortification on the river Ra|ven&s;bourn, not far from Lewi&s;ham, inclo&s;ed with triple rampires and ditches of a va&s;t height and depth, and near two miles in circuit, which is &s;up|po&s;ed to have been a work of the Romans. A pavement of &s;hell, or &s;hell-like &s;tones, of the conchite &s;ort, di&s;covered near Hunton on the Medway, in the year 1683. Keeth-coty-hou&s;e, a monument of huge &s;tones near Aylesford, &s;up|po&s;ed to be the tomb of Catigern the Briton, who was killed here in a battle with the Saxons. At Gillingham, near Roche&s;ter, &s;ix hundred Nor|man gentlemen, who came in the retinue of the princes Edward and Alfred, were ma&s;&s;acred by

earl Godwin. Gad's-hill, near Grave&s;end, is noted for the pranks played there by Henry V. when prince of Wales. Great variety of Roman coins have been found at Reculver, the antient Regalbium, near Canterbury. In the year 1738 a number of broad pieces was found by a farmer at Tun&s;tal near Sittingbourn, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been buried there in the civil wars. At Cran|brook, fifteen miles from Maid&s;tone, the woollen manufacture was fir&s;t introduced into England by &s;ome Flemings, whom Edward III. had invited over for that purpo&s;e. Richborough, or Stonar, near Sandwich, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the antient Rutupiae, a famous city and port of the Romans. At Richborough are &s;till &s;ome remains of walls, and a tower. Before Sandwich gates are two Ro|man tumuli, and &s;ix Celtic ones on the &s;ea-&s;hore. Between Sandwich and Richborough are the re|mains of an amphitheatre of turf, on an emi|nence.</P>

<HEAD>BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>This county is bounded by the Engli&s;h chan|nel on the &s;outh; St. George's channel on the we&s;t; the Bri&s;tol channel on the north; and the river Tamar &s;eparates it on the ea&s;t from Devon|&s;hire. Its name is &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome to be com|pounded of Carn, &s;ignifying a rock in the Briti&s;h, and Gauls or Waules, the name that the Saxons gave the Britons; but others think it derived from the Latin cornu, or the Briti&s;h kern, which &s;ig|nifies a horn, on account of its running out into the &s;ea, &s;omewhat in the form of a horn. It is &s;eventy miles in length, forty in breadth where broade&s;t, and not five in the narrowe&s;t part. Its cir|cumference is computed at one hundred and fifty miles, being divided into nine hundreds, in which are one hundred &s;ixty-one pari&s;hes, twenty-one parliamentary boroughs, twenty-&s;even market-towns, between twelve and thirteen hundred vil|lages, nine hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and acres, and one hundred and twenty-&s;ix thou&s;and inhabitants.</P>

<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The air of this county is &s;harp, but healthy. High and &s;udden winds are more common in this than in other counties. The &s;pring al&s;o and harve&s;t are ob&s;erved to be more backward, and the &s;ummers and winters more tempe|rate. It is a very rocky mountainous country, but the mountains are rich in metals, e&s;pe|cially tin. The valleys are very plea&s;ant and fer|tile, and yield plenty both of corn and pa&s;ture. The lands near the &s;ea-coa&s;t are manured and fer|tilized
<PB N="273" REF="2780">
with &s;ea-weed, and a kind of &s;and, formed by particles of broken &s;hells, as they are da&s;hed again&s;t each other by the &s;ea. This county abounds in mines of tin and lead, moor-&s;tones, lapis calami|naris for making bra&s;s, Corni&s;h diamonds, and a yellow ore, called mundick; whence copper and lapis calaminaris are extracted. Cattle of all &s;orts are &s;maller here than in any other parts of Eng|land; and the wool of the &s;heep, which are mo&s;tly without horns, is very fine, and the fle&s;h, both of them and the black cattle, extremely delicate. The county is well &s;upplied with fi&s;h from the &s;ea and rivers; but of the &s;ea-fi&s;h the mo&s;t noted and profitable is the pilchard, of which prodigious quantities are caught from July to November, and cured and exported, e&s;pecially to Spain. It is &s;aid that a million have been &s;ometimes taken at a draught. Excellent cod are al&s;o caught upon the coa&s;t. The pilchards are not gutted, as is u&s;ual with other &s;orts of fi&s;h, the entrails being the fatte&s;t part, and e&s;teemed the mo&s;t delicate. Here is al&s;o great plenty of &s;ea and land fowl, both wild and tame. The Corni&s;h chough is a kind of crow, with a red bill and feet: it breeds on the coa&s;t between the Lizard and Land's-end.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Of the TIN-MINES.</HEAD>
<P>The tin dug from the&s;e mines, after the ore is re|duced to powder by mills and wa&s;hed, is melted into pigs of three or four hundred weight, with the owner's name &s;tamped upon them. There are five towns, Le&s;kard, Le&s;twithel, Truro, Hel&s;ton, and Penzance, where the tin is a&s;&s;ayed and marked at Mid&s;ummer and Michaelmas, or Lady-day and Chri&s;tmas, with the &s;eal of the dutchy of Cornwall. When it is thus marked, and the duty of four &s;hillings for every hundred weight paid, the tin|ner
<PB N="274" REF="2790">
may di&s;po&s;e of it as he plea&s;es; only the king or duke of Cornwall are to have the preference, if they chu&s;e to be purcha&s;ers. The cau&s;es ari&s;ing among the tinners are tried by juries return|ed by the mayors of the &s;tannary or coinage-towns, before the lord-warden or his deputy. In con&s;ide|ration of their paying &s;o high a duty for the coin|age of their tin, for in Devon&s;hire they pay only eight-pence for the hundred weight, and as a re|ward for their loyalty, and to encourage them in their application to the laborious, dangerous, and di&s;mal bu&s;ine&s;s of mining, they have had many privileges be&s;towed upon them by our kings, and by the earls and dukes of Cornwall. The natives are remarkable for their &s;trength and acti|vity, as well as their dexterity in wre&s;tling, in which exerci&s;e the Corni&s;h hug is highly extolled.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>CONSTITUTION.</HEAD>
<P>Ever &s;ince Edward III. created his elde&s;t &s;on duke of Cornwall, the elde&s;t &s;ons of the kings of England have enjoyed that title; and have royal prerogatives and privileges in the duchy, &s;uch as the nomination of its &s;heriff, a right to the duty on tin, wrecks, cu&s;toms, &amp;c. Tho' this county is much inferior to &s;ome others in point of populou&s;|ne&s;s and wealth, particularly York&s;hire and Mid|dle&s;ex, yet it &s;ends a far greater number of mem|bers to parliament, viz. forty-four, which is near|ly equal to the number &s;ent from North-Britain, and double that &s;ent from Wales. This great di&s;proportion, &s;o dangerous to the con&s;titution, is attributed to the partiality of our monarchs, on account of the great revenue they received from it, or to the intere&s;t of its antient dukes. The bo|roughs which &s;end members to parliament, and of which there are &s;even or eight &s;o incon&s;iderable
<PB N="275" REF="2800">
as to have no church, are as follow: Lance&s;|ton, Le&s;kard, Le&s;twithiel, Truro, Bodmin, Hel|&s;ton, Salta&s;h, Camelford, We&s;tlow, Ea&s;tlow, Gram|pound, Penryn, Tregony, Bo&s;&s;iney, St. Ives, Fowey, St. Germans, St. Michaels, Newport, St. Maws, and Kellington. Each of the&s;e &s;ends two mem|bers, which, with the two knights for the &s;hire, make forty-four.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Lance&s;ton is a populous trading town, the chief of the county, as well as the mo&s;t antient. Here the members for the county are always cho&s;en; and here, and at Bodmin, the a&s;&s;izes are held by turns. The manor is held in fee-farm of the prince of Wales, and the town governed by a mayor, recorder, and eight aldermen. There is a free-&s;chool in it, founded and endowed by queen Elizabeth.</P>
<P>Le&s;kard is large and well built, has &s;everal manufactures of leather, and enjoys almo&s;t as great a trade as any town in the county. It has al&s;o a large church, a hand&s;ome town-hall, a free-&s;chool, a curious conduit, and was incorporated by queen Elizabeth, by the &s;tile of mayor and bur|ge&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Le&s;twithiel &s;tands on the river Tay, which is now &s;o choaked up with &s;and, that &s;hips come no farther than Fowey, which is at the mouth of it. This town, however, &s;till retains the bu&s;helage of corn, coals, &s;alt, and malt, in Fowey, and the anchorage in its harbour. The weights and mea|&s;ures, and the common gaol for the whole &s;tannary, together with the county courts, are kept here. The church of this town, and that of Hel&s;ton, are the only places of wor&s;hip in the whole coun|ty that have &s;pires. The corporation con&s;i&s;ts of
<PB N="276" REF="2810">
&s;even capital burge&s;&s;es, of whom one is mayor, and &s;eventeen common-council-men. The town is well built, and has a woollen-manufacture.</P>
<P>Truro is a con&s;iderable town, and as well built as any in the county. It is governed by a mayor, who is al&s;o mayor of Falmouth, four aldermen, twenty capital burge&s;&s;es, and a recorder. At the election of the mayor, &s;ix-pence is paid for every hou&s;e in the town to the lord of the manor, by way of acknowledgment; but the corporation has a right to the keyage of all goods laden or un|laden at the port of Falmouth. Great quantities of copper ore are found in the mountains between this and St. Michaels; in &s;hipping off which and tin mo&s;t of the trade of the town con&s;i&s;ts. The inhabitants are noted for the elegance of their dre&s;s, and genteel manner of living.</P>
<P>Bodmin was once the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, the re|mains of who&s;e palace, and likewi&s;e of a friary and priory, are &s;till to be &s;een. The town extends about a mile in length, between two hills, and is governed by a mayor, twelve aldermen, out of whom the mayor is cho&s;en, twenty-four common-council-men, and a town clerk. On Holgaver|moor, in the neighbourhood, a prodigious num|ber of people a&s;&s;emble every year about the mid|dle of July, for &s;port and pa&s;time; when, among other diver&s;ions, there are mock trials before a per|&s;on called the mayor of Halgover. This is the only &s;taple-town in the county, having a good market for corn and meat, and a pri&s;on for debtors.</P>
<P>Hel&s;ton con&s;i&s;ts of four &s;treets in the form of a cro&s;s, and is a large populous place, near the mouth of a little river called Cober, where the tin &s;hips often take in their lading. The &s;pire of the church is &s;o high, that it &s;erves for a &s;ea-mark. The town is governed by a mayor and four aldermen, who are to be of the common-council, and to
<PB N="277" REF="2820">
chu&s;e twenty-four a&s;&s;i&s;tants. It enjoys &s;everal privileges, in particular that of holding &s;e&s;&s;ions of the peace for the town.</P>
<P>Salta&s;h. There is a ferry from hence to Ply|mouth, which is only a league di&s;tant. Here is al&s;o a church, free-&s;chool, and market, and a great trade in malt and beer. The town is go|verned by a mayor and &s;ix aldermen, who are &s;tiled the council of the borough, and may chu&s;e a recorder. It has con&s;iderable privileges, as a court of admiralty, coroner's inque&s;t, anchorage of foreign &s;hipping, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Camelford is a &s;mall town and corporation, &s;tanding near the river Camelford, who&s;e arms are a camel pa&s;&s;ant over a ford.</P>
<P>Portpigham has al&s;o the name of We&s;tlow, from its &s;ituation on the we&s;t &s;ide of the river Low, op|po&s;ite to Ea&s;tlow, on the other &s;ide. The river has a &s;tone-bridge over it, and is navigable for ve&s;&s;els of a hundred tons. The trade of the town, which is but &s;mall, is chiefly in pilchards, and the corporation con&s;i&s;ts of a mayor and twelve bur|ge&s;&s;es, out of whom the mayor is cho&s;en, and who together have a power to elect a &s;teward.</P>
<P>Ea&s;tlow is a more con&s;iderable place than We&s;t|low, and is governed by a mayor and eight capi|tal burge&s;&s;es, of whom one is always the mayor, and a recorder cho&s;en by the mayor and burge&s;&s;es. Here is a chapel of ea&s;e to the mother-church of St. Martin's, and a &s;mall battery of cannon.</P>
<P>Grampound is a corporation, tho' it con&s;i&s;ts but of one &s;treet, and has many privileges, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing two fairs, and a market, exempted from toll thro' all Cornwall, view of frank-pledge, a&s;&s;ize of bread and beer, the property of &s;everal mills and lands, &amp;c. It &s;tands almo&s;t in the centre of the county, upon the river Falle, over which it has a bridge.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="2830">
Penryn is a neat town, adorned with gardens and orchards, and an arm of the &s;ea on each &s;ide. This town has a &s;hare in the pilchard and New|foundland-fi&s;heries, and &s;ome con&s;iderable mer|chants inhabit it. Here is a good cu&s;tom-hou&s;e and key, with a free-&s;chool founded by queen Elizabeth, a pri&s;on, and a guildhall. The mayor and two of the aldermen are ju&s;tices of the peace; and the corporation has a power to try felons, with an office of record every three weeks.</P>
<P>Tregony &s;tands on a river which is navigable by boats. It was incorporated by James I. and had antiently a ca&s;tle, which is now gone to de|cay. Its chief manufacture is &s;erge; and the an|tient, and now noble, family of the Bo&s;cawens are lords of the manor.</P>
<P>Bo&s;&s;iney, or Tintagel, had antiently a ca&s;tle, e&s;teemed one of the wonders of the county, as &s;tanding on two rocks, one on the land, and the other on the &s;ea, joined by a draw-bridge. Here king Arthur is &s;aid to have been born, and to have been killed in a battle near Camelford. All that have free-land in the borough, and live in the pari&s;h, are freemen, and have votes in the election of its members and magi&s;trates.</P>
<P>St. Ives. Before the harbour was choaked up with &s;and, this town drove a con&s;iderable trade in pilchards and Corni&s;h &s;lates. Here is a &s;pacious church, and a grammar-&s;chool, founded by Charles I. and at no great di&s;tance are &s;ome cop|per mines. From Madern-hills, betwixt this and the Land's-end, is a noble pro&s;pect of both chan|nels, and of the ocean. The town is governed by a mayor, eleven aldermen, and twelve bur|ge&s;&s;es, with a recorder, town-clerk, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Fowey, or Foy, is a large town upon the Eng|li&s;h channel, and its trade is very con&s;iderable, e&s;pecially in pilchards. In antient times it di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
<PB N="279" REF="2840">
it&s;elf greatly by &s;ea; for it is &s;aid to have had once &s;ixty &s;ail of large &s;hips belonging to it, to have triumphed at different times over all the Cinque-ports, and to have taken &s;everal French men of war. There was once a tower on each &s;ide the river on which the town &s;tands, for its defence, the ruins of which are &s;till vi&s;ible. The corporation con&s;i&s;ts of a mayor, recorder, eight aldermen, a town-clerk, and two a&s;&s;i&s;tants: and the mayor, for the time being, and the next year after, together with the &s;enior alderman, is a ju&s;tice of the peace.</P>
<P>St. Germans, tho' once an epi&s;copal &s;ee, which was tran&s;lated hither from Bodmin, and from thence afterwards to Exeter, is now but a mean hamlet, governed by a portreve, or mayor, who is al&s;o bailiff, and may make any hou&s;e in the vil|lage the pri&s;on of tho&s;e whom he arre&s;ts. The ruins of the epi&s;copal palace are &s;till vi&s;ible in the neighbourhood. The pari&s;h is the large&s;t in Cornwall, and contains &s;eventeen villages, and a great many gentlemen's &s;eats.</P>
<P>St. Michaels is an antient borough, tho' now but a mean hamlet, governed by a portreve cho&s;en out of the &s;ix chief tenants of the manor, by a jury of the principal inhabitants.</P>
<P>Newport, lying in the &s;ame pari&s;h as Launce&s;ton, is neither a corporation nor borough; but its elections are managed, and its members returned, by two per&s;ons, called Vianders, cho&s;en yearly at the court-leet of the lord of the manor.</P>
<P>St. Maws. The inhabitants of this town, which con&s;i&s;ts of one &s;treet fronting the &s;ea, live chiefly by fi&s;hing. The ca&s;tle here, and Pen|dennis ca&s;tle, oppo&s;ite to it, were both built by Henry VIII. for the defence of Falmouth haven.</P>
<P>Kellinton is a con&s;iderable town, both for wealth and number of inhabitants. Its chief
<PB N="280" REF="2850">
&s;upport is a woollen manufacture; and it is go|verned by a portreve, who is cho&s;en yearly by the burge&s;&s;es at the court-leet of the lord of the manor. Whoever has lived a twelvemonth in the borough, is qualified to be admitted a burge&s;s.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the parliamentary boroughs, the fol|lowing places de&s;erve to be mentioned, viz.</P>
<P>Falmouth is by far the mo&s;t wealthy and po|pulous, and has the mo&s;t trade of any in the county. Its harbour, in which the whole royal navy may ride in &s;afety, is, as we ob&s;erved already, defended by two ca&s;tles, with garri&s;ons. Here is the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e for mo&s;t of the towns in the county, and the &s;tation for the packet-boats to Portugal and the We&s;t-Indies. Its &s;hare in the pilchard fi&s;hery, and trade to Portugal, are al&s;o very con&s;iderable. It is governed by a mayor and aldermen, and gives title of vi&s;count to the family of Bo&s;cawen.</P>
<P>Penzance, which is the farthe&s;t we&s;t of any town in England, and within ten miles of the Land's|end, is well built and populous. Veins of lead, tin, and copper, are plainly di&s;tingui&s;hable here at low-water, running into the &s;ea. Near this town lies Mount's-bay, which is a very &s;afe har|bour again&s;t the &s;outh-winds. It has its name from a high rock in it, called the Corni&s;h-mount, or St. Michael's-mount, there being a fort on it, with a chapel dedicated to that archangel.</P>
<P>St. Neots. The only circum&s;tance for which this place is worth mentioning, are the paintings in the gla&s;s windows of the church, relating to &s;ome particular traditions of the Jews. It is pro|bable the inhabitants had the&s;e from the Jews them&s;elves, who traded hither for tin.</P>
<P>Pad&s;tow is very conveniently &s;eated for trading to Ireland. Its name is a contraction of Petrock|&s;tow, from one Petrocus, a Briti&s;h &s;aint; and its
<PB N="281" REF="2860">
chief trade is in herrings, which come up the channel in October, and in &s;late-tiles.</P>
<P>New-i&s;land, in its neighbourhood, is noted for camphire and &s;ea-fowl.</P>
<P>Wadbridge is another market-town, which takes its name from a large &s;tone bridge over the river Camel, &s;ome of the arches of which are &s;aid to have been founded upon woolpacks, on account of the quick-&s;and at the bottom of the river.</P>
<P>Redruth is a con&s;iderable market-town between St. Ives and Truro, much re&s;orted to by the tin|ners.</P>

<HEAD>Of the SCILLY ISLES.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e i&s;lands, called by the Greeks Ca&s;&s;iterides, are reckoned part of Cornwall. They are about one hundred and forty in number, and about thirty miles from the Land's - end. Some are overflowed at high-tides, but mo&s;t of them are high and rocky. Several are very fruitful both in corn and pa&s;ture, particularly St. Mary's, which is the large&s;t, being nine miles in circumfe|rence, with a harbour and ca&s;tle. Scilly, from which all the re&s;t are named, was once accounted the mo&s;t con&s;iderable. Many abound with rabbits, &s;wans, cranes, and herons. Formerly they were famous for tin mines; but of the&s;e there are now no ve&s;tiges. The inhabitants have plenty of fi&s;h, as well as milk and cattle. Notwith&s;tanding the light-hou&s;es kept here, &s;hips in dark nights and hard gales, or by mi&s;reckoning, are in danger of being driven on &s;hore, and beat to pieces; and the&s;e i&s;les have actually been fatal to many ve&s;&s;els, by being &s;ituated &s;o much in the way of &s;hips bound from the channel to the &s;outhward, or from the &s;outhward to the channel. But how|ever the merchant and &s;ailor may &s;uffer, the inha|bitants are often great gainers by &s;hipwrecks; for in &s;tormy weather great trea&s;ure is often driven on &s;hore. Dr. Halley &s;ays the true latitude of the Lizard is forty-nine degrees fifty minutes; and that the variation of the compa&s;s ever &s;ince the year 1657, has been con&s;iderably we&s;terly: he therefore recommends it to all ma&s;ters of &s;hips, that they &s;teer two watches ea&s;t-by-&s;outh, for one ea&s;t, which will exactly keep them parallel; as al|&s;o that they come out of the &s;ea on a parallel not more northerly than forty-nine degrees, forty mi|nutes, which will bring them clear by the Lizard.</P>

<P>This county is bounded on the &s;outh by the Engli&s;h channel; by the Bri&s;tol channel on the north; on the ea&s;t it has Somer&s;et&s;hire, and on the we&s;t Corn|wall, from which it is divided by the river Tamar. It extends in length &s;ixty-nine miles, in breadth &s;ixty-&s;ix, and two hundred in circumference, being divided into thirty-three hundreds, in which are twelve boroughs that &s;end members to parliament, forty market-towns, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and thirty-three villages, and three hundred and forty thou&s;and inhabitants.

<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The air, both on the hills and in the vallies, is healthy, though much &s;harper on the former than in the latter. The &s;oil is various; in the we&s;tern parts of the county it is coar&s;e and moori&s;h, and bad for &s;heep, though proper for black cattle, of which here are bred great numbers. In the northern parts, the dry &s;oil and downs are well adapted to &s;heep, with numerous flocks of which they are covered. Tolerable crops of corn are al&s;o rai&s;ed there when the land is well manured. The &s;oil of the re&s;t of the county is rich and fertile, both in corn and pa&s;ture, yielding al&s;o, in &s;ome places, plenty of marle for manuring it. In other places, where there is a &s;carcity of manure, they improve the land with a&s;hes, produced by paring

off and burning the &s;urface. Abundance of ex|cellent rough cyder is made in &s;ome parts of the county; and formerly there was a great deal of tin dug out of it, tho' now very little. In this county are al&s;o found veins of load&s;tone, and quarries of &s;late and &s;tone for building, of which con&s;iderable quantities are exported. Its principal manufactures are woollens of &s;everal &s;orts, and bone-lace. It has mineral waters at Cleave, Ta|vi&s;tock, Lamerton, Lifton, &amp;c. Its chief rivers are Tamar, Tave, Lad, Ock, Tame, Touridge, Ex, and Dart. There were antiently a great many boroughs in this county which &s;ent members to parliament; but the only towns now repre&s;ented are the&s;e: Exeter city, Totne&s;s, Plymouth, Oke|hampton, Barn&s;taple, Plympton, Honiton, Tavi|&s;tock, A&s;hburton, Dartmouth, Beeral&s;ton, and Tiverton.</P>

<P>Exeter is called I&s;ca by Ptolemy, and by An|toninus I&s;ca Danmoniorum. The pre&s;ent name is a contraction of Exce&s;ter, that is, a city upon the Ex. Edward the Confe&s;&s;or transferred the bi&s;hop's &s;ee hither from Crediton, and it had &s;o many mona|&s;teries formerly, that it was called Monkton. The city is now large, populous, and wealthy, with gates, walls, and &s;uburbs: the circumference of the whole is about two miles, being well &s;upplied with water, brought in pipes from the neighbourhood. It con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of four &s;treets, which meet in the centre of the town. In a part of the old ca&s;tle, called Rougemount, from the red &s;oil on which it &s;tands, are held the a&s;&s;izes, quarter-&s;e&s;&s;ions, and county-courts. This ca&s;tle is &s;aid to have been antiently the re&s;idence of the We&s;t Saxon kings, and after them of the earls and dukes of Corn|wall.

Here is a noble cathedral dedicated to St. Peter, three hundred and ninety feet long, and &s;eventy-four broad; and notwith&s;tanding it was four hundred years in building, yet looks as uniform as if built by one architect. In the Clo&s;e about it are the hou&s;es of the dean and chapter. It has an organ &s;o large, that the greate&s;t pipe is fifteen inches diameter. Be&s;ides this, there are a great many churches and chapels, meeting-hou&s;es, ho&s;pitals, alms-hou&s;es, charity-&s;chools, and pri&s;ons. There is al&s;o a work hou&s;e, and a county-infirmary, three hun|dred feet in length, of which the fir&s;t &s;tone was laid in 1741. This city is a county of it&s;elf, governed by a mayor, twenty-four aldermen, a recorder, cham|berlain, &s;heriff, town-clerk, &s;word-bearer, and four &s;tewards. When they go to church on publick occa|&s;ions, they are attended by four &s;erjeants at mace, and four &s;taff-bearers. The magi&s;trates and free|men, who are about twelve hundred, chu&s;e the members of parliament. The magi&s;trates have exten&s;ive powers with re&s;pect to the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, both in civil and criminal cau&s;es. For|merly the &s;ea flowed up to the city walls, and &s;hips loaded and unloaded at the water-gate; but the navigation of the river was afterwards &s;o ob&s;tructed by the weers made in it by Hugh Courtney, earl of Devon, that the merchants brought their goods from Top&s;ham by land. A channel, however, hath been &s;ince cut thro' the dams, and ve&s;&s;els of one hundred and fifty tons now come up to the key. There is a prodigious woollen manufacture in this city of &s;erges, perpetuanas, long-ells, drug|gets, and ker&s;eys. A &s;erge-market is kept weekly in South-gate-&s;treet, in which goods to the amount of &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds are &s;ometimes &s;old in a week. Roman coins have been often dug up here, and the city hath been frequently be&s;ieged, taken, plundered, and burnt; and that, for the mo&s;t part,
<PB N="288" REF="2940">
in con&s;equence of its loyalty to its &s;overeigns, for which it hath been greatly applauded. It gives title of earl to a branch of the noble family of Cecil. Near this city is the pari&s;h of Heavy|tree, &s;o called from the gallows erected for the execution of malefactors. Mrs. Tuckfield, who&s;e hu&s;band had been &s;heriff of the county in the reign of Edward VI. purcha&s;ed a piece of ground for their burial, and left money to buy them &s;hrouds. Sir Thomas Bodley, founder of the Bodleian library, and lord chancellor King, were both born in this city.</P>
<P>Totne&s;s, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of one broad &s;treet, three quarters of a mile long, had formerly a ca&s;tle and walls, of which &s;ome remains are &s;till vi&s;ible. Here the famous fo&s;&s;e-way began, and extended to Lincoln. This is the mo&s;t antient borough in the county, tho' it was not made a corporation till the reign of king John. It has a fine church, a town-hall, free-&s;chool, and a &s;tately bridge over the Dart. The method of taking &s;almon-peel here is extremely diverting: a &s;paniel trained up to the &s;port, drives them into a &s;hove-net, by which means they will &s;ometimes catch thirty at a time, which, tho' &s;even|teen or twenty inches long, are &s;old for two-pence a piece.</P>
<P>Plymouth was antiently only a fi&s;hing village, but is now the large&s;t town in the county next to Exeter. For this great change it is indebted to its port, one of the &s;afe&s;t in England, and capa|ble of containing one thou&s;and &s;ail. The town and harbour are defended by &s;everal forts, and a &s;trong citadel, erected by Charles II. mounting near' three hundred guns. Here are docks, wet and dry, with all other conveniences and nece&s;&s;a|ries requi&s;ite for building and repairing &s;hips, and is as complete an ar&s;enal as any belonging to the government.

They have al&s;o a right to the toll of the markets, of the corn, yarn, &amp;c. the profits of the mills, and the revenues of the &s;hambles. The town is well &s;upplied with water, which was brought from a place &s;even miles di&s;tant, at the ex|pence of Sir Francis Drake, who was a native of the &s;hire; as were al&s;o Sir John and Sir Richard Hawkins, the three greate&s;t &s;ailors of the age. Here are two hand&s;ome pari&s;h churches, a cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, four ho&s;pitals, a workhou&s;e, and charity-&s;chool. The inhabitants drive a con&s;iderable trade to the Streights and We&s;t-Indies, and have a &s;hare of the pilchard fi&s;hery. On the Eddy&s;tone rock, at the entrance of the bay, is a curious light-hou&s;e, erect|ed by the corporation of Trinity-hou&s;e. Around the dock, which is about two &s;hort miles from Plymouth, the buildings have multiplied &s;o much as to form a pretty town of con&s;iderable extent.</P>
<P>Okehampton, &s;tanding at the mouth of the Oke, from which it takes its name, is governed by a mayor, eight capital burge&s;&s;es, and as many a&s;|&s;i&s;tants, a recorder, ju&s;tice, and town-clerk. It is a con&s;iderable thoroughfare, has a manufacture of &s;erge; and the eight principal members of the corporation have a right to the toll of its fairs and markets.</P>
<P>Barn&s;taple. The name of this town is com|pounded of bar, which in the Briti&s;h &s;ignifies the mouth of a river, it being &s;ituated at the mouth of the Taw, and &s;taple, implying in the Saxon tongue a place of trade. It had formerly a ca&s;tle, great privileges, and a con&s;iderable traffic, part of which was transferred to Biddiford, when its har|bour became &s;o &s;hallow, as not to admit any but &s;mall ve&s;&s;els. However, its trade &s;till exceeds that
<PB N="290" REF="2970">
of Biddiford. It is plea&s;antly &s;ituated among hills, the &s;treets are clean and well paved, and gives title to one of the archdeaconries of the dioce&s;e of Exeter, which are four in all, viz. Exeter, Barn|&s;taple, Totne&s;s, and Cornwall, and is noted for fine ale. The corporation con&s;i&s;ts of a mayor, twenty-four capital burge&s;&s;es, of whom two are aldermen, a high-&s;teward, recorder, deputy-re|corder, and other officers.</P>
<P>Plympton takes its name from the river Plym, tho' it is above a mile from it, and is called Plymp|ton-Maurice, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from Plympton-Mary, which is only half a mile di&s;tant. The town con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of two &s;treets, has a well en|dowed free-&s;chool, had formerly a ca&s;tle be|longing to the earls of Devon, and is governed by a mayor, recorder, eight principal inhabitants, a bailiff, and town-clerk.</P>

It is an antient borough by pre&s;cription, and governed by a portreve, cho&s;en at the court-leet of the lord of the manor.

<P>Tavi&s;tock derives its name from the Tave, on the banks of which it &s;tands. Here was antiently a &s;tately abbey, and a &s;chool, where the old Saxon tongue was taught.

Here is a harbour in which five hundred &s;ail may ride in &s;afety, defended by &s;everal ca&s;tles, forts, and blockhou&s;es: be&s;ides a chain, upon occa&s;ion, may be laid acro&s;s the river's mouth. The trade of the town is very con&s;iderable, particularly in fi&s;h from Newfoundland. The inhabitants like|wi&s;e trade with Portugal and the plantations, and have a large &s;hare in the pilchard fi&s;hery. The corporation, which con&s;i&s;ts of a mayor, twelve ma&s;ters, twelve common-council-men, a recorder, two bailiffs, a town-clerk, and high-&s;teward, have a power to make freemen, to hold a court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, and water-bailiffwick-court, and are lords of the manor and royalty of Toun&s;tall. The town gives the title of earl to the family of Legge. At a village called Brixham, near this town, is a remarkable well, called Laywell, which ebbs and flows every hour five or &s;ix inches, and &s;ometimes bub|bles up like a boiling pot, yet does not appear to have any communication with the &s;ea.

<P>Axmin&s;ter. When Athel&s;tan defeated the Danes at Brunaburg, in the neighbourhood of this town, he founded a min&s;ter, and college of prie&s;ts, to pray for the &s;ouls of tho&s;e that were &s;lain in the engagement. This min&s;ter being &s;ituated upon the Axe, the town that afterwards grew up there, acquired the name of Axmin&s;ter. It carries on a little trade in ker&s;eys, druggets, and other articles of the woollen manufacture. In the hundred to which this town gives name, at A&s;h, in the pari&s;h of Mo&s;bury, was born that great and illu&s;trious general, John, duke of Marlborough.</P>
<P>Comb-Martin lies a little to the ea&s;t of Ilfra|comb. Its neighbourhood is noted for producing the be&s;t hemp in the county.

<P>Lundy-i&s;land, three miles long, and two broad, is &s;o encompa&s;&s;ed with rocks, as to be acce&s;&s;ible only in one place; and even there the entrance is &s;o narrow, that two men can hardly go abrea&s;t.

<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>This county is plea&s;antly diver&s;ified with hills and valleys, and the air of both is healthy. It has an exten&s;ive &s;ea-coa&s;t, along which the air is e&s;teemed whole&s;ome; is very fruitful in corn and pa&s;ture, the downs feeding an incredible num|ber of &s;heep, and the lower grounds yielding rich pa&s;ture for black cattle. It produces a great deal of wool and woollen-cloth, hemp, flax, and linen, and is al&s;o well provided with materials for building and fuel, having quarries of excellent &s;tone at Portland and Purbeck, with &s;tore of wood in Black-more-fore&s;t. Nor does it abound le&s;s with wild

<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Dorche&s;ter, the county-town, is very antient, for here the Romans had one of their principal &s;tations; and a mile off is a camp with five trenches, enclo&s;ing ten acres, now called Maiden-ca&s;tle, which is a mo&s;t noble piece of antiquity. The town, called by Antoninus Dorovernia, is &s;ituated upon the river Frome, and con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of three &s;pacious &s;treets, which terminate towards the centre. There are few towns in England better paved and built. Here are three churches, a town-hall, &s;hire-hall, a free-&s;chool, three alms-hou&s;es, and the county-gaol. The a&s;&s;izes and quarter-&s;e&s;&s;ions are held in this town, and the knights of the &s;hire are elected. It is noted for its excellent beer, and for the va&s;t number of &s;heep fed upon the neigh|bouring downs, which generally have two lambs at a time; and, on that account, are much valued all over England. The woollen manufacture and the malt-trade are much declined in this town; but its markets and fairs are well frequented, and the toll of both is ve&s;ted in the corporation, which holds the manor as a fee-farm rent from the crown.
<PB N="299" REF="3060">
Some remains of the old Roman walls, and Iken|ing-&s;treet, are &s;till de&s;cernible; and, in the neigh|bourhood, the ruins of an amphitheatre, where, as well as in other places about the town, Roman coins are often found, which they call Dorn money.</P>
<P>Lyme-Regis, or Kings-Lyme, is a &s;ea-port at the mouth of the Lyme, from which it derives its name. The harbour and key are inferior to none in England, but very chargeable. The town has great privileges granted by &s;everal kings, as a court of hu&s;tings, freedom from tolls, la&s;tage, &amp;c. The corporation con&s;i&s;ts of a mayor, a recorder, fifteen capital burge&s;&s;es, two of whom, with the mayor, are ju&s;tices, and a town-clerk. Its trade was formerly &s;o great, that the cu&s;toms, in &s;ome years, amounted to &s;ixteen thou&s;and pounds. The harbour, called the Cobb, lies about a quarter of a mile from the town; and there are &s;ome guns planted at proper places for the defence both of it and the town. The merchants here have &s;ome &s;hare in the pilchard fi&s;hery. The Bermudas or Summer i&s;lands took their name from Sir George Summers, a native of this town, and its repre&s;en|tative in parliament in the reign of James I. and it was at this place the unfortunate duke of Mon|mouth landed in 1685.</P>
<P>Bridport, or Burport, is a great thoroughfare, and had once a con&s;iderable trade, now greatly declined. It was, in particular, noted for its hemp and hempen manufactures; but, though there is &s;till a great deal of that commodity rai&s;ed in the neighbourhood, yet the trade is very much decayed. The corporation, who are lords of the borough under the king, and pay a &s;mall quit-rent into the exchequer, con&s;i&s;ts of two bailiffs, fifteen capital burge&s;&s;es, a recorder, and town-clerk.
<PB N="300" REF="3070">
By their charter they have all fines, a power to hold lands and tenements, and other privi|leges.</P>
<P>Weymouth, deriving its name from its &s;ituation at the mouth of the river Wey, is a very neat agreeable town, though it lies low. Melcombe-Regis, which &s;tands on the oppo&s;ite bank of the river, makes with it but one corporation, which &s;ends as many members to parliament as London; every voter having, as in the capital, the privilege of polling for four per&s;ons. The corporation con|&s;i&s;ts of a mayor, recorder, two bailiffs, twenty-four capital burge&s;&s;es; and every mayor is an al|derman for life. Here is a cu&s;tom-hou&s;e and good key, but little trade, unle&s;s what is clande&s;tine. Their fair trade is chiefly in wine, and fi&s;h brought from Newfoundland. The town gives title of vi&s;count to the family of Thynne.</P>
<P>Melcombe-Regis, as we ob&s;erved before, makes but one corporation with Weymouth, being &s;ituated upon the oppo&s;ite bank of the river, and joined to it by a bridge. The&s;e towns were united into one corporation in the reign of James I. Mel|combe has four tolerable &s;treets, and is the mo&s;t thriving and populous of the two; yet the port, which is &s;aid to be the mo&s;t frequented in the county, and is defended by two ca&s;tles, goes by the name of Weymouth.</P>
<P>Over again&s;t the&s;e towns lies what is called the i&s;le of Portland, though it is in reality a penin|&s;ula, about &s;even miles round, and but thinly in|habited; for though it yields plenty of corn and pa&s;ture for &s;heep, yet wood and other fewel is &s;o &s;carce, that the inhabitants are forced to burn cow-dung dried in the &s;un. Its lofty rocks render it inacce&s;&s;ible on all &s;ides except towards the north, where is a &s;trong ca&s;tle called Portland-ca&s;tle; and on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore another, called Sands-foot.
<PB N="301" REF="3080">
The &s;ea betwixt, on account of the &s;trong current, is called Portland-race, and is very dangerous; but there are two lights to guide the mariner. From the ea&s;t end of the i&s;land runs a bank of gravel and pebbles, near &s;even miles in length, ca&s;t up by the &s;ea, at a little di&s;tance from the &s;hore, and called Che&s;il-bank. In the narrow &s;ea between, are &s;everal thou&s;and &s;wans belonging to the family of Horner. This i&s;land is remarkable for its quarries of fine white free-&s;tone, of which great quantities are exported; and gives title of duke to the family of Bentinck, of Dutch extraction. The inhabi|tants were famous &s;lingers of old. Among the &s;ea-weeds here is often found <HI>i&s;idis placamon,</HI> i. e. I&s;is's hair, which is a &s;ort of &s;hrub produced by the &s;ea, not unlike coral; it has no leaves, and when cut, changes colour, growing black, hard, and brittle.</P>
<P>Wareham. Here was antiently a ca&s;tle and a noted harbour; in con&s;equence of which it be|came a large place, and had &s;eventeen churches, which are now reduced to three, all &s;erved by one mini&s;ter; for he preaches in the large&s;t the &s;um|mer half year, and in the other two by turns in winter. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to have ri&s;en on the decay of Stowborough, a &s;mall village in the neighbour|hood, which was once governed by a mayor, but now by a bailiff. The royalty of the town was ve&s;ted by general Erle in the corporation for ever, to put poor children out apprentices. The toll of the market al&s;o belongs to the corporation, which con&s;i&s;ts of a mayor, recorder, town-clerk, &s;ix ca|pital burge&s;&s;es, twelve common-council-men, and their a&s;&s;i&s;tants. The mayor is coroner not only of the town, but of the i&s;les of Purbeck and Bran&s;|key. The chief dependence of the place is now upon the fine tobacco-pipe clay dug out of a hill in the neighbourhood.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="3090">
Corfe-ca&s;tle &s;tands in that &s;pot which is called the I&s;le of Purbeck, though it is in reality only a penin&s;ula. It took its name from a very &s;trong ca&s;tle, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been built by king Edgar; and had many privileges, &s;uch as an ex|emption from toll, arre&s;ts, &s;uit, or &s;ervice with|out the borough, granted fir&s;t by queen Eliza|beth, and confirmed by Charles II. The ca&s;tle, which was demoli&s;hed in the civil wars, appears to have been exceedingly &s;trong and large, the ruins being near half a mile in circumference. The lord of this manor is, by inheritance, lieutenant of the i&s;le, appoints all officers, determines by his bailiffs and deputies all actions, and is admiral of the coa&s;t. This i&s;le is about ten miles long and &s;ix over; and is full of heaths, woods, and fore&s;ts, abounding with deer. It is noted for its fine &s;tone quarries and marble, of both which, e&s;pecially the former, great quantities are exported.</P>
<P>Pool is &s;urrounded every way with water, except to the north, where it is joined to the continent; and took its name from the bay below it, which, in a calm, looks like a &s;tanding water or pool. The decay of Wareham, and the act of parliament in the reign of Henry VI. transferring the franchi&s;es of Melcombe hither, contributed greatly to its growth and increa&s;e. It is now one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable ports in the we&s;t of England; and, in particular, has a large &s;hare in the Newfound|land fi&s;hery: but its trade, as well as that of other towns on the coa&s;t, has &s;uffered much by the high duties laid on French goods. The corpora|tion con&s;i&s;ts of a mayor, alderman, bailiffs, and burge&s;&s;es. The mayor is admiral and e&s;cheator within the town and liberty, and clerk of the mar|ket. The town has divers other privileges granted by queen Elizabeth. Great quantities of Pur|beck &s;tone, of pickled oy&s;ters, and other fi&s;h,
<PB N="303" REF="3100">
and of corn, pea&s;e, and beans, are exported from hence.</P>
<P>Shafte&s;bury is pretty large, hand&s;ome, and po|pulous, &s;tands upon a hill, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been built by Alfred about the year 880. Here was antiently a famous mona&s;tery, be&s;ides ten churches. Water is &s;o &s;carce in it, that the in|habitants have been obliged to dig pits to &s;ave rain water, there being but two &s;prings in the whole town, and the&s;e the property of private per&s;ons. It was incorporated by queen Eliza|beth and king Charles II. and is governed by a mayor, twelve aldermen, bailiffs, and common|council. From this town Sir Anthony A&s;hley Cooper took the title of earl in the twenty-fourth of Charles II.</P>
<P>The&s;e are all the parliamentary boroughs: of the other towns the mo&s;t con&s;iderable are,</P>
<P>Blandford, an antient borough, governed by two bailiffs, cho&s;en out of the capital burge&s;&s;es, or aldermen. It hath been twice almo&s;t entirely de&s;troyed by fire, fir&s;t in queen Elizabeth's time, and again in the year 1731; but it hath been &s;ince rebuilt more beautiful than before, and gives the title of marquis to the duke of Marlborough. The town is chiefly employed in the manufacture of cloth, and malting. The adjoining downs of Burford are extremely plea&s;ant, and full of coun|try &s;eats.</P>
<P>Winburn. Here is a collegiate church, a very noble edifice, one hundred and eighty feet in length, with a choir of &s;inging men and boys. Antiently there was al&s;o a min&s;ter or mona&s;tery. The market for black cattle begins on Good-Friday, and la&s;ts &s;everal weeks. There is a well endowed free-&s;chool in the town, and a manufacture of &s;tockings; but the inhabitants, in general, are poor.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="3110">
Sherburn is a large town, and very antient. The number of its inhabitants is computed at ten thou&s;and It was long an epi&s;copal &s;ee, having had a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of twenty-five bi&s;hops; but this &s;ee was removed in the eleventh century to Sali&s;|bury. The county went along with the &s;ee, till Henry VIII. made it a &s;eparate dioce&s;e, under the bi&s;hop of Bri&s;tol. The chief manufactures of the town are buttons, bone-lace, and haberda&s;hery wares. The antient cathedral and abbey church, which is now parochial, is a mo&s;t magnificent &s;tructure, and, be&s;ides other monuments, has tho&s;e of the Saxon kings Ethelbald and Ethel|bert. Here is a free-&s;chool, a fine alms-hou&s;e, and antiently there was a ca&s;tle in that part of the town &s;till called Ca&s;tle-town.</P>

<P>Be&s;ides tho&s;e already taken notice of, there were three other famous abbies in this county, viz. tho&s;e of Abbot&s;bury, Middleton, and Brindon. Middleton-abbey was founded by king Athel&s;tan, by way of atonement for taking away both the life and crown of his brother Edwin. The manor of Bren&s;ton, near Blandford, was antiently held in grand &s;erjeanty by this odd tenure, viz. by finding a man to go before the king's army for forty days when he &s;hould make war in Scotland, &s;ome records &s;ay in Wales, bare-headed and bare|footed, in his &s;hirt and linen drawers, holding in one hand a bow without a &s;tring, and in the other an arrow without feathers.

<P>The air of this county is very pure and plea&s;ant, e&s;pecially upon the downs, on which va&s;t flocks of &s;heep are kept and bred. In the champain part of the county, where it is clear of wood, the &s;oil is very fertile, producing plenty of all &s;orts of grain. The county is extremely well wooded and watered; for be&s;ides many woods on private e&s;tates, in which there are va&s;t quantities of well grown tim|ber, there is the New-fore&s;t of great extent be|longing to the crown, well &s;tored with venerable oaks. In the&s;e woods and fore&s;ts, great num|bers of hogs run at large, and feed on the acorns; and hence it is, that the Hamp&s;hire bacon &s;o far excels that of mo&s;t other counties. With re&s;pect to water, it has the rivers Avon, Anton, Arle, Te&s;t, Stowre, and Itchin, be&s;ides many rivulets, all a|bounding in fi&s;h, e&s;pecially trout.

<P>Winche&s;ter, the capital, is a very antient city; for it is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been built &s;everal cen|turies before Chri&s;t. The Romans called it Venta Belgarum, the Britons Caer Givent, and the Saxons Wittancea&s;ter, whence came the pre&s;ent name. It &s;tands upon the river Itchin, in a bot|tom &s;urrounded with chalky-hills, and is generally allowed to have been a con&s;iderable place in the time of the Romans. Some of the fir&s;t converts to Chri&s;tianity are &s;uppo&s;ed to have lived here. In the ca&s;tle, near the we&s;t-gate, many of the Saxon kings antiently kept their court. In the hall, where the a&s;&s;izes are kept, is &s;hewn a round table of one piece of wood, which, it is pretended, is above twelve hundred years old, and was that at which king Arthur, with his knights, u&s;ed to carou&s;e: but Cambden &s;ays, it plainly ap|pears to be of a much more modern date. There is an in&s;cription in Saxon characters upon it, which is now illegible, &s;aid to be the names of his twenty-four knights. The cathedral was founded by Kenegulfe, a king of the Mercians; but there were many Chri&s;tians, and places for their wor&s;hip here, long before that period. Kine|wal, or Kenwalchius, the &s;on of Kenegulfe, tran&s;|lated the &s;ee of Sherburn hither, and made Wina, a Frenchman, the fir&s;t bi&s;hop; who, falling after|wards under the di&s;plea&s;ure of Kinewal, purcha&s;ed the &s;ee of London of Wulphire, king of Mer|cia, and is reckoned the fir&s;t &s;imoniacal bi&s;hop in England. Here Egbert I. &s;ole monarch of England, was crowned; and not long after Swithin, one of the bi&s;hops of this &s;ee, was canonized.
<PB N="308" REF="3150">
We are told by the monki&s;h writers, that near this town a &s;ingle combat was fought between Colbrand, a Dani&s;h giant, and Guy, earl of Warwick. An|other of the bi&s;hops of this &s;ee was Denewulf, whom Alfred preferred to it, tho' he had been a &s;wine-herd, after he had acquired a &s;ufficient &s;tock of learning, as a reward for having concealed him from the Danes. A mona&s;tery was built here by Edward the Elder, and richly endowed by him and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. Edward the Confe&s;&s;or was crowned in this place by Ed&s;ius, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. At that time Alwyn was bi&s;hop of this &s;ee; but was confined to a mona&s;tery on &s;u&s;pi|cion of a criminal corre&s;pondence with queen Emma; from which he was di&s;charged upon the queen's clearing her&s;elf by ordeal. By way of thank&s;giving to St. Swithin for her deliverance, the queen gave nine manors to his church. Wal|kelin, the next bi&s;hop, laid the foundation of the pre&s;ent cathedral. William the Conqueror kept his court here; and at this place he beheaded Waltheof, the great Saxon earl of Northumber|land. He not only confined for life in the ca&s;tle, but put out the eyes of Ederic, another Saxon earl, becau&s;e he had delivered up the ca&s;tle of York to Edgar Atheling. Giffard, the next bi&s;hop, to terminate the quarrels between the monks of the old and new min&s;ters, removed the latter to Hyde, in this neighbourhood, where he had built an abbey for their reception. His &s;ucce&s;&s;or was Henry of Blois, brother to king Stephen, who reduced the empre&s;s Maud to &s;uch &s;traits in this city and ca&s;tle, that &s;he cau&s;ed a report to be &s;pread of her death, and was carried out in a coffin. The bi&s;hop, after his return, founded and endowed the ho&s;pital of St. Cro&s;s, about a mile to the &s;outh of this city, and built the bi&s;hop's palace called Wolve&s;ey. Here Henry
<PB N="309" REF="3160">
II. held a parliament, and was crowned with his queen. When Godfrey Lucy, &s;on to Richard, lord chief ju&s;tice of England, and governor of the ca&s;tle, was bi&s;hop, Richard II. granted a charter, with very ample privileges, to the citizens. King John re&s;ided in this city; and his &s;on Henry III. was born there. Peter de la Roche, another of its bi&s;hops, was lord chief ju&s;tice, and governor of the kingdom, in the minority of Henry III. In his time Henry the Lion, duke of Bavaria, with his duche&s;s Matilda, daughter of Henry II. re|&s;ided at Winche&s;ter, where their &s;on William, duke of Bavaria, was born. Henry III. kept his Chri&s;tmas here in 1239, when Raleigh was bi&s;hop. When the barons ro&s;e, the city was taken, and all the Jews in the town put to the &s;word; but the earl of Leice&s;ter, who&s;e &s;on had taken it, being &s;lain, it was recovered by the king. After the murder of Edward II. his uncle, Edmund Plan|tagenet, was beheaded at the ca&s;tle-gate of this city. <Q>William Edendon, bi&s;hop of this &s;ee, being elected archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, refu&s;ed it, &s;aying, &startq;If Canterbury is the higher rack, Win|che&s;ter is the better manger.&endq;</Q> This bi&s;hop, who had been trea&s;urer of England, was buried in an alaba&s;ter tomb on the &s;outh-&s;ide of the entrance into the choir. He was &s;ucceeded by the famous Wil|liam of Wickham, &s;o denominated from a village near this place, who became prime mini&s;ter to Edw. III. He procured a charter, by which this city was made a &s;taple for wool; and founded a college called St. Mary's, which he endowed with a liberal main|tenance for a warden, ten fellows, two ma&s;ters, &s;e|venty &s;cholars, three chaplains, three clerks, an or|gani&s;t, and &s;ixteen chori&s;ters, to which he granted great privileges. The college con&s;i&s;ts of two courts, in which are lodgings for the ma&s;ters and &s;cholars, &amp;c. a large hall, chapel, &s;chools, and a library. After a certain time of continuance in the &s;chool, the &s;cho|lars,
<PB N="310" REF="3170">
if they chu&s;e to pro&s;ecute their &s;tudies, have exhibitions for that purpo&s;e in New-college, Ox|ford, which was al&s;o founded by Wickham. The &s;ame prelate built al&s;o the nave of the church, and obtained the offices of chancellor to the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and prelate of the garter, to be an|nexed to this &s;ee. <Q>Be&s;ides the&s;e donations, he ex|pended twenty thou&s;and marks in the repair of hou&s;es, mended the highways from hence to London, built &s;everal free-&s;chools and ho&s;pitals both in this county and Surry, all which have his coat of arms on them, with this motto, &startq;Manners make the man.&endq;</Q> Henry IV. was married in this city; and Henry V. gave audience in it to the French amba&s;&s;adors who came to implore peace. The bi&s;hop at that time was Henry de Beaufort, uncle to the king, who was thrice chancellor of the king|dom, a cardinal, and general of the pope's forces again&s;t the Bohemians. He founded an ho&s;pital here, left legacies to all the cathedrals of England, and lies buried in a fine tomb in the church, in which he is repre&s;ented in his cardinal's robes and hat. Arthur, elde&s;t &s;on of Henry VII. was born in this city in 1486. Waynfleet, bi&s;hop of this &s;ee, founded Magdalen college in Oxford. One of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, Richard Fo&s;&s;e, collected the bones of Kengulfe, Kinulphus, Egbert, Edmund, Canute, queen Emma, William Rufus, and his brother Richard, which had been di&s;per&s;ed in the civil wars, depo&s;ited them in leaden che&s;ts, and interred them at the foot of the great wall of the choir. In 1554 queen Mary was married in this city to Philip of Spain, and the chair u&s;ed on that occa|&s;ion is &s;till pre&s;erved. In her reign the per&s;ecuting Gardiner was bi&s;hop of this &s;ee. One of his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors was Cooper, author of the The&s;aurus, which bears his name. Mr. Tru&s;&s;el, who continued Daniel's Hi&s;tory of England, wrote a Hi&s;tory of all its bi&s;hops and bi&s;hoprics, a particular de&s;cription
<PB N="311" REF="3180">
of this city, and the occurrences therein, with the origin of cities in general, was bred at Winche&s;ter &s;chool. Morley, who was bi&s;hop of this &s;ee after the Re&s;toration, built a new epi&s;copal palace, and a college for ten mini&s;ters widows, which he en|dowed with a good revenue. In his time, a palace was began, and almo&s;t fini&s;hed here by Ch. II, which is now going to ruins. In the mona&s;tery at Hyde was a cro&s;s, the gift of Canute the Dane, which co&s;t him one year's revenue of all England. When the monks were ejected out of the other convent dedicated to the Holy Trinity, they were &s;ucceed|ed by a dean and twelve prebendaries. The cathe|dral is a large pile, and has a venerable look, but is not very elegant. Be&s;ides the tombs, there are many curious pieces of workman&s;hip in it, the chief of which are, 1&s;t, The font, erected in the time of the Saxons. 2d, Copper &s;tatues of James I. and Charles I. 3d, The bi&s;hop's throne. 4th, The &s;talls' of the dean and prebendaries. 5th, The a&s;cent to the choir and altar. 6th, The pavement, in|laid with marble of diver&s;e colours, in various figures. 7th, The altar-piece, reckoned the noble&s;t in England. 8th, The paintings in the windows, e&s;pecially the great ea&s;t window. At the ho&s;pital of the Holy Cro&s;s mentioned above, every travel|ler that knocks at the door may claim a manchet of white bread and a cup of beer, of which a great quantity is provided every day for that purpo&s;e. This ho&s;pital was intended for the maintenance of a ma&s;ter and thirty pen&s;ioners, but only fourteen are now maintained in it; and the ma&s;ter enjoys a revenue of eight hundred pounds a year. This city is about a mile and a half in compa&s;s, and almo&s;t &s;urrrounded with a wall of flint, has &s;ix gates, large &s;uburbs, broad clean &s;treets; but the private hou&s;es are, in general, but ordinary, many of them being very old. The city is inter&s;per&s;ed with
<PB N="312" REF="3190">
a great many gardens, which contribute to its beau|ty and healthine&s;s. There is a great deal of good company in the city and neighbourhood, and many clergymen, but little trade or manufacture. Many other public edifices, be&s;ides tho&s;e we have men|tioned, adorn this city, particularly an infirmary, an ho&s;pital called St. John's, and the guildhall. The corporation con&s;i&s;ts of a mayor, high-&s;tewad, recor|der, aldermen, two coroners, two bailiffs, twenty|four common-council-men, a town-clerk, four con|&s;tables, and four &s;erjeants at mace, and the city gives title of marquis to the duke of Bolton. A Roman highway leads from hence to Alton, and went formerly, as it is thought, from thence to London. The charming downs in the neigh|bourhood contribute greatly to the health and plea&s;ure of the inhabitants. The river Itchin is navigable for barges from hence to Southampton.</P>
<P>Southampton &s;tands between two rivers at the bottom of a bay, called Southampton water, which is &s;o deep, that it will carry &s;hips of five hundred tons up to the town. Great quantities of timber are brought down both the rivers to this town, whence it is conveyed to Port&s;mouth. A little to the ea&s;t, where St. Mary's hamlet is now &s;ituated, &s;tood antiently the Roman town Clau&s;entum, the ruins of which are &s;till vi&s;ible; and Roman coins are often found about it. This town was afterwards called Hamtun, and was plundered and burnt by the French in the reign of Edward III. but an|other &s;oon aro&s;e in the place where the pre|&s;ent Southampton &s;tands, which Richard II. &s;ur|rounded with walls, building al&s;o a ca&s;tle for the defence of it and the harbour. The wall con&s;i&s;ts of tho&s;e little white &s;hells that grow on the backs of oy&s;ters Here Henry V. mu&s;tered his army before his fir&s;t expedition to France; and here Philippa, wife to Edward III. founded an ho&s;pi|tal, called God's-hou&s;e; and Henry VII. a mona&s;|tery.

The town has one of the longe&s;t and broade&s;t &s;treets in England, and a very fine key. Its trade &s;eems to have been more con&s;iderable for|merly than it is at pre&s;ent. Mo&s;t of that carried on now is with Jer&s;ey and Guern&s;ey, be&s;ides which, there is a little with France and Portugal for wine, and to Newfoundland for fi&s;h. The town was made a corporation by Henry II. and king John; and a county of it&s;elf by Henry VI. and a fort, called the tower, on which &s;ome cannon are mounted, was erected by Henry VIII. near the key. The town had its la&s;t charter from Charles II. Here is a cu&s;tom-hou&s;e and a collector, with a free-&s;chool. The mayor of the town is admiral of the coa&s;t from South-&s;ea to Hur&s;t-ca&s;tle. The a&s;&s;izes for the county are u&s;ually held here.</P>
<P>Port&s;mouth is the chief harbour and &s;tation of the royal navy, and the key of England. It &s;tands at the entrance of a creek, in the i&s;le of Port&s;ey, which is about fourteen miles in compa&s;s, &s;ur|rounded at high tides by the &s;ea, and joined to the continent by a bridge. There was formerly a town nearer the bottom of the creek, where Ve&s;|pa&s;ian is &s;aid to have landed, called by Ptolemy, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, i. e. the great harbour; and by our ance&s;tors Portperes and Portche&s;ter; but the &s;ea retiring from it, the inhabitants removed to the &s;pot on which Port&s;mouth now &s;tands. The town was a place of &s;ome note in the reign of Richard II. for the inhabitants then fitted out a &s;mall fleet, with which they defeated the French. Two forts were built at the entrance of the harbour by Edward IV. and Henry VII. placed a garri&s;on in it; queen Fliza|beth made great additions to the fortifications, which have been &s;o improved and augmented &s;ince, that it is almo&s;t impregnable. Here are all the materials and conveniencies for building, re|pairing, rigging, arming, victualling, and com|pletely equipping &s;hips of all rates, from the lea&s;t
<PB N="314" REF="3220">
to the greate&s;t: it is amazing to &s;ee the immen&s;e quantities of military and naval &s;tores. The num|ber of men employed in the yard, is never le&s;s than a thou&s;and. In &s;hort, the docks and yards, with dwelling-hou&s;es for the commi&s;&s;ioner and all the &s;ubordinate officers and ma&s;ter-workmen, appear like a di&s;tinct town. Here king Charles II. met the infanta of Portugal, whom he had e&s;pou&s;ed. Though the &s;ituation of the town is low and agui&s;h, the &s;treets dirty, provi&s;ions, lodgings, and fuel dear, fre&s;h water &s;carce; yet, &s;o great is the re&s;ort of &s;oldiers and &s;eamen, e&s;pecially in time of war, that the inns and taverns are perpetually crouded. A &s;ufficient number of troops are kept in garri&s;on, which is con&s;iderably augmented in war-time. A commi&s;&s;ioner pre&s;ides over the yard, a governor or deputy-governor over the garri&s;on; and a mayor, aldermen, and burge&s;&s;es over the town, under the governor. Here is a noble ar|&s;enal; and a thou&s;and &s;ail of &s;hips may ride &s;afe in the harbour, the mouth of which is &s;ecured on the Go&s;port &s;ide, by four forts, and a platform of twenty great guns level with the water; and on the other &s;ide by South-&s;ea ca&s;tle. As Port&s;mouth does not admit of any enlargement of buildings, a &s;ort of &s;uburb has been lately begun on the ad|joining heath, which increa&s;es &s;o fa&s;t, that it bids fair &s;oon to out&s;trip the town it&s;elf, both in num|ber of inhabitants and beauty of buildings. In the dock-yard is a royal academy of much the &s;ame nature as that of Woolwich. In July, 1760, a mo&s;t dreadful fire broke out in the dock-yard, &s;uppo&s;ed to be occa&s;ioned by lightning, in which were con|&s;umed prodigious quantities of naval &s;tores of all kinds, to an immen&s;e value.</P>
<P>Go&s;port is a large town of great trade. Here &s;trangers who vi&s;it Port&s;mouth generally lodge, and mo&s;t of the &s;ailors wives live. It is &s;ituated in re&s;pect of Port&s;mouth, much in the &s;ame manner as South|wark
<PB N="315" REF="3230">
to London, only there is no bridge betwixt the former; but boats are continually pa&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Five miles from hence lies Southwick, where was the &s;eat of colonel Norton, who made that extraordinary will, by which he left a per&s;onal e&s;tate of &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds, and a real one of &s;ix thou&s;and pounds a year to the poor, hungry, thir&s;ty, naked, &s;ick, wounded, pri&s;oners, and &s;trangers, to the end of the world. But upon ex|amination, it carried &s;uch &s;trong marks of in&s;anity, that it was &s;et a&s;ide. The &s;ituation of the hou&s;e is low and wet; but the park ri&s;es from the hou&s;e to the highe&s;t point of Port&s;down, whence there is one of the fine&s;t and mo&s;t exten&s;ive pro&s;pects in England, taking in the South-downs, Port&s;mouth|town and harbour, the I&s;le of Wight, and a great extent of &s;ea to the &s;outh-ea&s;t. Along this coa&s;t, &s;alt is made of the &s;ea-water, which at fir&s;t is of a pale green, but by boiling turns to a pure white.</P>
<P>Petersfield is a pretty large town on the road from London to Port&s;mouth. By virtue of a charter from queen Elizabeth, and others of an earlier date, it is a corporation, by the &s;tile of mayor, burge&s;&s;es, and commonalty; yet the mayor is now cho&s;en at the court-leet of the lord of the manor.</P>
<P>Stockbridge, though a borough by pre&s;cription, and a great thoroughfare, is but a poor mean place. It was repre&s;ented in parliament by Sir Richard Steele, when he was expelled the hou&s;e in queen Anne's reign. The knight is &s;aid to have made u&s;e of a very diverting expedient to carry his election: at an entertainment he made for the electors and their wives, he &s;tuck an apple full of guineas, and declared it &s;hould be the prize of that man, who&s;e wife &s;hould be fir&s;t brought to-bed after that day nine months. The women were &s;o
<PB N="316" REF="3240">
plea&s;ed with the fancy, that they all engaged their hu&s;bands to vote for Sir Richard; and he was ac|cordingly returned. The town is governed by a bailiff, con&s;table, and &s;erjeants. The bailiff is the returning officer, and commonly an inn-keeper, or the dependent of one. Wheelwrights and car|penters make a great part of the inhabitants of the town, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Brige or Brage of Antoninus.</P>
<P>Near this town are three villages of the name of Wallop, the Upper, Middle, and Nether; and a river on which the villages &s;tand. We mention them here only on account of their giv|ing name and title of baron to the antient and ho|nourable family of the earl of Port&s;mouth, one of who&s;e ance&s;tors, in 1513, fitted out &s;ome &s;hips, with which he burnt twenty-one towns in Nor|mandy, and all the French &s;hips in the ports of Naples and Tripoly, by way of repri&s;al for piracies committed on the Engli&s;h by that nation.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t-church took its name from its church, which was antiently collegiate, and dedicated to the holy Trinity; but Ralph Hammond, bi&s;hop of Durham, who had been dean of it, changed the name of Trinity to that of Chri&s;t, when he rebuilt it. From its &s;tanding between two rivers, the Avon and Stour, near their conflux, it had at fir&s;t the name of Twinambourne. It is a large popu|lous borough, and had antiently a ca&s;tle built by Richard de Redvers, earl of Devon&s;hire, in the time of Henry I. The Avon was made navigable from hence to Sali&s;bury, about the year 1680. The manufactures of the town are chiefly &s;ilk|&s;tockings and gloves. Though its foreign trade is incon&s;iderable, it is well furni&s;hed with officers of the cu&s;toms. On the town's &s;eal is the figure of Baldwin de Revers, from whom it had its fir&s;t pri|vileges,
<PB N="317" REF="3250">
and who lived in the time of king Ste|phen.</P>
<P>Lymington is a &s;ea-port town at the entrance of the bay of Southampton, and is a corporation by pre&s;cription, con&s;i&s;ting of a mayor, aldermen, and burge&s;&s;es. The mayor is cho&s;en by the burge&s;&s;es, and &s;worn in at the court of the lord of the manor. A great quantity of &s;alt is made here, and mo&s;t of that which is u&s;ed in the &s;outhern parts, is brought from hence, either by land or water. The &s;alt is &s;aid to be exceeding good for pre&s;erving fle&s;h. Merchant-&s;hips and &s;mall craft are built at this town, the &s;ituation of which is healthy and plea|&s;ant, as it &s;tands on a hill, and commands a pro&s;pect of the &s;ea and the I&s;le of Wight. It gives title of vi&s;count to Wallop, earl of Port&s;mouth.</P>
<P>Hur&s;t-ca&s;tle, which was built by Henry VIII. for the defence of New-fore&s;t, &s;tands at the extre|mity of a neck of land, whence is the &s;horte&s;t pa&s;|&s;age to the I&s;le of Wight. It is mounted with cannon, and has a &s;mall garri&s;on. Hither king Charles I. was brought from the I&s;le of Wight, and confined three weeks. The place is &s;o un|healthy, that the garri&s;on is often obliged to &s;hift its quarters. This, with Cal&s;hot-ca&s;tle, a little more to the ea&s;t, and tho&s;e of St. Andrew's and Netley, command the &s;ea all along this coa&s;t, and perfectly &s;ecure the entrance of the bay of Southampton.</P>
<P>Whitchurch is but a mean town, though it has a great road lying through it, and a manufacture of &s;halloons, &s;erges, and other articles of the woollen manufacture. The mayor is cho&s;en annu|ally at the court of the dean and chapter of Win|che&s;ter, who are lords of the manor. Its &s;itua|tion on the edge of the fore&s;t of Chute, makes it very plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>Andover, a large hand&s;ome town, and a great thoroughfare, &s;tanding plea&s;antly on the &s;ide of
<PB N="318" REF="3260">
the downs on the river Aude, was made a corpora|tion by queen Elizabeth, but had its fir&s;t charter from king John. Here was antiently a college of Benedictine monks; and now there is a free-&s;chool, charity-&s;chool, and ho&s;pital, with a great manufacture of &s;halloons and malt. In the neigh|bourhood, at a poor mean village, called Weyhill, is one of the greate&s;t fairs in England for hops, chee&s;e, and &s;heep.</P>
<P>As the other parliamentary boroughs are &s;ituated in the I&s;le of Wight, we &s;hall forbear de&s;cribing them till we come to that i&s;le; and proceed to the other remarkable places of the county upon the continent.</P>
<P>Ringwood &s;tands on the river Avon, and is a large thriving place, in con&s;equence of its manu|factures of druggets, narrow cloths, &s;tockings, and leather; be&s;ides which it has a good market for corn and cattle. Near this place, the duke of Monmouth was found in a ditch, covered with fern, after the battle of Sedgemoor.</P>
<P>Rum&s;ey is a pretty large antient town, plea&s;antly &s;ituated. It had formerly a mona&s;tery of monks, which was afterwards converted into a nunnery; and of which Mary, only daughter of king Ste|phen, was &s;ome time abbe&s;s. Matthew of Al&s;ace, &s;on to the earl of Flanders, privately conveyed away this lady, who was a nun, and married her; but after he had two children by her, was fain to &s;end her back. In the old church here, king Ed|ward and his &s;on Afred, were interred. This town is a corporation, has a manufacture of cloth, and was the birth-place of Sir William Petty, ance&s;tor of the earls of Shelburne.</P>
<P>Arlesford is governed by a bailiff and eight burge&s;&s;es, and has a good market for &s;heep. It was burnt down in 1610, but hath been &s;ince re|built in a better manner. Part of the Roman high|way,

which pa&s;&s;es by this town towards London, &s;erves for the head of a pond or little lake near the town.</P>
<P>Ba&s;ing&s;toke is very antient, large, populous, and a great thoroughfare. This town has a market, much frequented, for corn of all &s;orts; and a great quantity of malt is made in it. Here, in 871, the Danes defeated king Etheldred. The manufactures of druggets, &s;halloons, and other woollen &s;tuffs, have been carried on here lately with great &s;ucce&s;s. The town is a corporation; and be&s;ides a church, has a very hand&s;ome chapel built by the fir&s;t lord Sandys, and a free-&s;chool. In the neighbourhood &s;tood old Ba&s;ing-hou&s;e, a fa|mous fortre&s;s in the time of the civil wars. The marquis of Winche&s;ter, ance&s;tor of the duke of Bolton, with a re&s;olute band of veterans, bid de|fiance in it for a long time to the parliament|forces; but at la&s;t it was taken by &s;torm by Crom|well, and burnt to the ground.

<HEAD>BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>This i&s;land was by the antient Britons called Guith, which &s;ignifies a &s;eparation, or land &s;epa|rated from the continent, whence the Romans formed Vecta, Vectus, and Vecte&s;is; and, as the Germans always change the V into a W, the Ro|man name was converted into Wecta, Wect, and at la&s;t into Wight. It &s;tretches along a part of the Hamp&s;hire coa&s;t, to which county it belongs, and from which it is divided by a very narrow channel, e&s;pecially that part oppo&s;ite to Hur&s;t-ca&s;tle. This channel was antiently called Solent, and is re|markable for the violence and rapidity of its tides. The i&s;le is of an oval form, its length from ea&s;t to we&s;t is twenty miles, its greate&s;t breadth twelve, and its circumference &s;ixty. The mo&s;t ea&s;terly point is oppo&s;ite to Port&s;mouth, and the mo&s;t we&s;terly to Chri&s;t-church. It is encompa&s;&s;ed with rocks, of which the mo&s;t noted are the Needles, the Shingles, the Brambles, and the Mixen; the la&s;t are &s;o called from their filth, the word in the
<PB N="322" REF="3300">
Saxon &s;ignifying a dunghill, as the needles are &s;o denominated from their &s;harpne&s;s. The &s;ea breaks &s;o far into the i&s;land on the north &s;ide, that it is al|mo&s;t divided into two; and that part which lies to the ea&s;t of the inlet is actually called Binbridge; and that to the we&s;t, Fre&s;hwater i&s;le. It lies in the dioce&s;e of Winche&s;ter, contains fifty-two pa|ri&s;hes, four market towns, of which three &s;end members to parliament, viz. Newport, Yarmouth, and Newton, four ca&s;tles, and near thirty thou&s;and inhabitants. They have a well-di&s;ciplined militia of their own, be&s;ides which three thou&s;and of the Hamp&s;hire, and two thou&s;and of the Wilt|&s;hire militia, are obliged to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in ca&s;e of need. Where the i&s;land is acce&s;&s;ible, which is but in few places, there are ca&s;tles built for its defence; and in time of war, beacons are &s;et up to give notice of the approach of an enemy.</P>

<P>The Romans &s;ubdued it about the year 45; after them it was &s;ubject to the We&s;t Saxons till the
<PB N="323" REF="3310">
year 650, when it was reduced by the Mercians, but recovered afterwards by the We&s;t Saxons. In 1012 king Ethelred pa&s;&s;ed the winter here, when he was expelled his kingdom by Swain, king of Denmark; and in the &s;pring went over to Nor|mandy. To&s;ti, Harold's brother, plundered it with the help of &s;ome Flemi&s;h pirates. Its fir&s;t lord, after the Conque&s;t, was William Fitzo&s;born. His &s;on having forfeited it by trea&s;on, it was given by Edward I. to Richard de Redvers, earl of Devon, in who&s;e family it continued, till it was &s;old to Henry I. for &s;ix thou&s;and marks; after which the lord&s;hip of the i&s;le remained in the crown two hundred years. A family, called from it de In&s;ula, or L'I&s;le, has long been eminent both here and upon the continent. King Richard II. granted it to the duke of York and his heirs; as did Henry VI. to Philippa, duche&s;s of York, for life, in lieu of a portion, and the rever&s;ion to Humphrey, duke of Glouce&s;ter, who, dying with|out i&s;&s;ue, the &s;ame Henry made his favourite, Henry de Beauchamp, king of Wight, and of Jer&s;ey and Guern&s;ey. He dying without i&s;&s;ue, Edward IV. made Richard, lord Woodville, his father-in-law, lord of the i&s;le of Wight, in who&s;e family it continued, till Henry VII. granted it for life to Sir Reginaldo Bray, on condition of paying three hundred and eight pounds yearly to the crown. The French have often attempted to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, but without &s;ucce&s;s, particularly in the reign of Richard II. and in tho&s;e of Henry IV. and VIII. The only circum&s;tance &s;ince that period worth mentioning in regard to this i&s;land, is the im|pri&s;onment of Charles I. in Cari&s;brooke-ca&s;tle, during eight months, when colonel Hammond was governor; and the reaty carried on between this king, and the commi&s;&s;ioners of the par|liament.

<P>Newport was antiently called Medena and Novus Burgus de Meden; whence the adjacent country, to the ea&s;t and we&s;t, is &s;till called Ea&s;t and We&s;t Meden. It was a borough by pre&s;cription, with the title of bailiffs and burge&s;&s;es, till king James I. incorporated it by charter. The town is large and populous, clean and well-built. It &s;tands on a river, which falls into the &s;ea at Cowes, and is navigable from thence by barges. It did not &s;end members to parliament till the reign of queen Elizabeth. The town has been much improved of late in beauty, extent, trade, and convenience; and is at pre&s;ent a very flouri&s;hing place. The church, though a large building, is only a chapel of ea&s;e to Cari&s;brooke, which is now but a &s;mall village on a lofty eminence, about a mile from Newport, though formerly a con&s;iderable town. The ca&s;tle is very antient, having been fir&s;t built by Whitgar, to whom Cerdic, the We&s;t Saxon king, gave it. Its antiquity, curio&s;ities, and ex|ten&s;ive pro&s;pect, render it well worth the attention of a traveller. Alexander Ro&s;s, who continued Sir Walter Raleigh's Hi&s;tory, and is burle&s;qued in Hudibras, was vicar of this village.</P>
<P>Yarmouth, which, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the other of that name in Norfolk, is called South Yarmouth, &s;tands on a creek on the north &s;ide of the i&s;land. It is a corporation, has hand&s;ome hou&s;es, built mo&s;tly of free-&s;tone, and a ca&s;tle with a garri&s;on.</P>

<P>Cowes is the name of two towns at the mouth of the river, but on oppo&s;ite &s;ides. We&s;t Cowes has a ca&s;tle with a garri&s;on, and is a very flouri&s;h|ing town. At Ea&s;t Cowes ve&s;&s;els of con&s;iderable burthen are built.

<HEAD>JERSEY,</HEAD>
<P>Lying four leagues from the neare&s;t part of Normandy, and twenty-five from the neare&s;t coa&s;t of England, was called by the Romans Cae&s;area, from which the modern name has been formed; Jer being a contraction of Cae&s;ar, and Ey &s;ignify|ing an i&s;land. It is in length about twelve miles, breadth where wide&s;t about &s;ix, and thirty in circumference. A great part of it is &s;urrounded by rocks and &s;helves, often fatal to mariners. The cliffs on the north &s;ide are very high, but the &s;outh is much lower, and almo&s;t level with the water. Both the hilly and low grounds are very fertile, producing all manner of trees, roots, and herbs, e&s;pecially apple-trees; but no corn enough to &s;up|ply the inhabitants. This want of corn is attributed chiefly to their laying out too much of their land in orchards; for there is no place in the world of the &s;ame extent, which produces &s;o much cyder. The hills are &s;o thick planted with trees, that the i&s;land looks at a di&s;tance like a fore&s;t. As mo&s;t of the&s;e are fruit trees, and the i&s;land produces nei|ther coal nor peat, there is a want of wood for fuel; in&s;tead of which the poor people are forced to dry and burn a &s;ea-weed, called Vraic, which is thrown up by the &s;ea in great quantities upon the beach, rocks, and little i&s;les, that &s;urround the great one. They not only u&s;e it for fuel but to manure their ground, either when reduced to a&s;hes, or in its natural &s;tate. The i&s;le is extremely well watered, having &s;prings even upon the highe&s;t hills. There is a tract of land which has been rendered quite u&s;ele&s;s by the &s;and thrown upon it by the we&s;t winds, which are &s;ometimes very boi&s;terous. Here is plenty of cattle and &s;heep, hor&s;es, hares, and rabbits. The &s;heep are &s;mall,
<PB N="328" REF="3360">
as well as the black cattle; but the wool of the for|mer, and the fle&s;h of both, is very fine. The &s;heep have &s;ometimes &s;ix horns. There is al&s;o great plenty of fowl, wild and tame, e&s;pecially &s;ea-fowl. Among the latter are &s;oland gee&s;e and barnacles; and among the former partridges, which have feathers of various colours, and are extremely beautiful. Be&s;ides the &s;everal kinds of fi&s;h caught upon the Engli&s;h coa&s;t, they have &s;ome peculiar to their own. The reverend Mr. Talle, who was rector of a pari&s;h here in king William's time, tells us that there is a fi&s;h &s;een about the i&s;le, with teats like a woman's, called a mermaid. The in|habitants u&s;e no malt liquors; cyder, wine, and brandy, being very plentiful and cheap. The butter is very good, and the honey excellent. The fields are inclo&s;ed with mounds of earth, &s;ix, eight, or ten feet high, and proportionably thick. The air of the i&s;land is very healthy, and the winters are milder, but more windy than in Eng|land. Tho&s;e of the inhabitants, who are tempe|rate, live to a great age; but luxury being more prevalent here than formerly, has brought in di&s;tempers unknown to their ance&s;tors. The hou&s;es in the i&s;land are generally of &s;tone, of which there is great plenty. There is one &s;ort called montmado &s;tone, which is of a reddi&s;h white, and may be cut and &s;haped like Portland &s;tone. Another &s;ort u&s;ed by them is of a blui&s;h white, brought from the French i&s;land Chau&s;e, and is of a fine grain; but they have their lime and &s;late either from France or England. They carry on a very con&s;iderable trade not only with France and England, but al&s;o with Spain, and &s;end &s;ometimes near thirty &s;ail of &s;hips to Newfoundland. The chief manufacture of the i&s;land is &s;tockings, of which a va&s;t number is knit here by the women and children. A great part of the wool they u&s;e
<PB N="329" REF="3370">
comes from England; two thou&s;and tods, uncomb|ed, being allowed them by act of parliament. As e&s;tates, both real and per&s;onal, are equally divided among &s;ons and daughters, there are few great ones; but as no taxes are paid upon home con|&s;umption, and the nece&s;&s;aries of life in general are cheap, a &s;mall e&s;tate is of more value here than in mo&s;t other places. The language generally &s;poken is French; but there are few people of fa&s;hion that cannot &s;peak Engli&s;h too. The prin|cipal families are of Norman extraction, with a few Welch and Engli&s;h. Gentlemen po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of manors are addre&s;&s;ed, as in France, by the name of their &s;eigneuries.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t there was but one governor for all tho&s;e i&s;les, who appointed the bailiffs; but &s;ince Henry VII. Jer&s;ey has had a di&s;tinct governor, and the bailiffs have been appointed by the crown. The governor is continued during the plea&s;ure of the &s;overeign, and is allowed the whole revenue of the i&s;land for the &s;upport of his dignity, except a &s;mall deduction for the &s;alaries and fees of the civil officers. The governor is ve&s;ted with the whole military power, and the bailiff and jurats with the civil and judicial, under certain limita|tions. The governor, with the concurrence of two jurats, may arre&s;t and impri&s;on any man on &s;u&s;picion of trea&s;on. No inhabitant can go out of the i&s;land, nor foreigner &s;ettle in it, without his knowledge and con&s;ent. No convention of e&s;tates can be held, nor, in &s;hort, any thing of impor|tance tran&s;acted, without his con&s;ent. All the ca&s;tles and garri&s;ons, together with militia, are en|tirely under his command. The principal fortre&s;s is Elizabeth ca&s;tle, where the lieutenant-governor re&s;ides, for the chief governor is generally ab&s;ent. The militia con&s;i&s;ts of two troops of hor&s;e, and five regiments of foot, with a train of twenty-five
<PB N="330" REF="3380">
bra&s;s field pieces. At every place round the i&s;land acce&s;&s;ible to an enemy, are guard-hou&s;es, with batteries of cannon. The bailiff and twelve jurats are cho&s;en by the people, by whom they are commonly &s;tiled ju&s;ticiers, but have no &s;alary. The bailiff has the di&s;po&s;al of all the places of the officers belonging to the high-court of ju&s;tice, ex|cept that of the attorney-general. He pre&s;ides in the court, pronounces &s;entence, and upon an equal divi&s;ion of the bench, has the ca&s;ting vote. The jurats are his a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. This court takes cognizance of all cau&s;es ari&s;ing within the i&s;land, trea&s;on excepted; but in civil cau&s;es an appeal lies to the privy council; and in ca&s;e of murder, where malice prepen&s;e does not appear evident to the court, they mu&s;t not proceed to &s;entence, till the fact is laid before his maje&s;ty, and his plea&s;ure is known. Seven of the jurats con&s;titute a court, and the terms are only three. There is another called a con&s;table, who is one of the chief per&s;ons of his pari&s;h, and his office generally triennial. He repre&s;ents his pari&s;h in the convention of e&s;tates, and pre&s;ides in every pari&s;h a&s;&s;embly for &s;ecular affairs; but in matters relating to the church, the mini&s;ter is pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;embly called the convention of e&s;tates of his maje&s;ty's i&s;land of Jer&s;ey, is compo&s;ed of the jurats, clergy, and con&s;tables. It is not deemed a convention, unle&s;s &s;even are pre&s;ent from each of the three bodies; nor can it be called without the con&s;ent of the magi&s;trates and governor, the latter of whom has a negative voice. This a&s;&s;em|bly naturalizes foreigners, rai&s;es &s;upplies for the public &s;ervice, &s;tates and audits the accounts of pub|lic receipts and expences, determines differences about the di&s;po&s;al and management of the church trea&s;ury, examines all propo&s;als and &s;chemes for the public benefit, appoints deputies to &s;olicit the

affairs of the i&s;land at the king's court, makes or|dinances again&s;t the profaners of the Lord's day, bla&s;phemers, common-&s;wearers, drunkards, and riotous and di&s;orderly per&s;ons. The inhabitants enjoy many valuable privileges, having been de|clared by &s;everal royal charters a free people, to be treated not as aliens and foreigners, but as na|tive Engli&s;hmen, throughout the king's dominions, and exempted, as a peculiar of the crown, from all taxes impo&s;ed by parliament.</P>
<P>The i&s;land is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been fir&s;t con|verted to Chri&s;tianity by St. Magloire, a Briton, who quitted a bi&s;hopric to turn evangeli&s;t. In the popi&s;h times, be&s;ides the &s;tately abbey of St. Hilier, &s;ituated where now is the lower ward of Elizabeth's-ca&s;tle, there were four priories, twelve pari&s;h churches, which &s;till remain, and above twenty chapels, &s;ome of which are now in ruins. At the reformation many prote&s;tant mini&s;ters fled thither from per&s;ecution in France, and entirely overturned popery. As for the eccle&s;ia&s;tical go|vernment, it is &s;ubject to the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;|ter, who&s;e commi&s;&s;ary, called a dean, in conjunc|tion with any two or three of the rectors, holds a &s;piritual court, from which an appeal lies to the bi&s;hop, or, if that &s;ee is vacant, to the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. Here are no pluralities; and tho' the tythes and &s;urplice fees are incon&s;iderable, the glebes are good, and the par&s;onage-hou&s;es kept in con&s;tant repair by the re&s;pective pari&s;hes. There are two grammar-&s;chools pretty well endowed, and &s;o &s;ituated as to &s;uffice for the whole i&s;land, which are under the direction of the dean and mini&s;ters. The churches are large Gothic &s;tructures, with lofty &s;pires and arched &s;tone-roofs, which are covered with &s;late, laid in a bed of &s;trong mortar. The highways in the i&s;land are kept in good order, and there are &s;urveyors in each tithing to take

<P>The pari&s;h of St. Owen's is remarkable for be|ing a royal fief, and for many hundred years the e&s;tate of the noble family of Carteret. This fa|mily, of which the chief branch is now ennobled by the title of earl of Granville, is very eminent in this i&s;land, and has been for many ages. They took their name from the lord&s;hip of Carteret in Normandy, which belonged to the family, till they lo&s;t it by their adherence to the kings of England, when Normandy was reunited to the crown of France in 1204. They have a great e&s;tate in this i&s;land, and the whole i&s;le of Sark, paying only fifty &s;hillings a-year out of it to the crown, of which it is held in capite. St. Ouen, who was archbi&s;hop of Rouen four hundred years before the conque&s;t, is &s;aid to have been of this family, and they have &s;ometimes been called by his name. They have many times di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in the defence or recovery of this i&s;land from the French; as they did in behalf of king Charles I. again&s;t the parliament. They have at all times bore a great &s;way in it, and generally have had a &s;hare in the government, in quality either of governors, or deputy-governors, com|manders of the forts and ca&s;tles, bailiffs, and jurats.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides a great number of villages and hamlets, there are two towns, viz. St. Hilier and St. Aubin. St. Hilier is the capital of the i&s;land, and con&s;i&s;ts of about four hundred hou&s;es. Its &s;ituation is both plea&s;ant and commodious, its &s;treets are broad
<PB N="333" REF="3410">
and well paved; and its market being the only one of the i&s;land, is re&s;orted to by people of all ranks, from every part. It has a good harbour, a capacious church, a fine corn-market, and &s;ham|bles, and is well &s;upplied with water. In &s;hort, it &s;carce wants any thing either nece&s;&s;ary or conve|nient. It took its name from Hilerius, a holy man and a hermit, who was &s;lain by the Normans, at their fir&s;t inva&s;ion of the&s;e parts.</P>
<P>St. Aubin is about three miles from Hilier. The inhabitants are mo&s;tly merchants and ma&s;ters of &s;hips, who &s;ettled there for the &s;ake of its port, the be&s;t in the i&s;land. Here is a fort mounted with cannon, clo&s;e to the harbour. This town is not half &s;o large as St. Hilier, but as neat. There is a hand&s;ome chapel in the town, and a church at &s;ome di&s;tance from it. It gives name to the bay, on which both it and St. Hilier &s;tand, and in the middle of which is St. Hilier's i&s;le, with Eliza|beth's ca&s;tle, one of the &s;tronge&s;t in the king's dominions.</P>
<P>As the government, laws, religion, language, and privileges of the other i&s;lands are the &s;ame with tho&s;e of Jer&s;ey, we &s;hall not have occa&s;ion to dwell upon them.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>GUERNSEY</HEAD>
<P>Is called Sarnia by Antoninus, and lies about twenty miles from Jer&s;ey, to which it is not comparable either for extent or fruitfulne&s;s. But this is not owing to the &s;oil's being le&s;s fertile, but to its not being &s;o well cultivated; for the indu&s;try of the inhabitants is applied more to commerce than agriculture: yet they have corn enough for their own con&s;umption, as well as cattle. It is ra|ther better fortified by nature than that of Jer&s;ey, and is well &s;upplied with fi&s;h, not only from the
<PB N="334" REF="3420">
&s;ea, but al&s;o from a large lake. The air is very healthy, and the &s;oil of &s;uch a nature, that no vene|mous creature will live in it. Here is a better har|bour than any in Jer&s;ey, defended by a very &s;trong fort. It is full of gardens and orchards, and has cyder in great plenty. Their language is French as well as their extraction, their fuel &s;ea-weed, or coal from England, and the drink of the better &s;ort French wine, which is as cheap as beer in England. That beautiful flower, called the Lilium Sarnien&s;e, is a native of this place; and here are found tho&s;e &s;harp &s;tones called Emerils, with which lapidaries poli&s;h diamonds, and glaziers cut their gla&s;s.</P>
<P>The fine harbour abovementioned is almo&s;t at the extremity of the i&s;land ea&s;t-ward. It is a &s;paci|ous bay capable of receiving large &s;hips, which may get to &s;ea from it with any wind. On this bay &s;tands the tower of St. Peter, where is a very noble pier, con&s;i&s;ting of va&s;t &s;tones laid clo&s;e together with much art and regularity. It is upwards of four hundred years &s;ince it was erected, and it bids fair to la&s;t for many ages. It is not only a &s;e|curity to the &s;hipping; but the top being laid with large &s;mooth flags, guarded with parapets, and of great length and breadth, is the ordinary walk of the inhabitants, commanding a mo&s;t delightful pro|&s;pect of the &s;ea, and the neighbouring i&s;lands. The governor generally re&s;ides in Ca&s;tle-Cornet at the mouth of the haven, and has all the ca&s;tles and garri&s;ons of the i&s;land under his command. The town is well &s;upplied with provi&s;ions, e&s;pecially fi&s;h, and carries on a great trade. Guern&s;ey is not &s;o populous, nor &s;o well wooded as Jer&s;ey, but they both agree in their productions, their original &s;ettle|ment, and their temporal and &s;piritual government. The Liturgy of the church of England is now &s;o univer&s;ally received, that there is not one congre|gation of di&s;&s;enters in the whole i&s;land. In the reign
<PB N="335" REF="3430">
of queen Mary, the genius of the Roman catholic religion di&s;covered it&s;elf here in a memorable in|&s;tance. Three women, the mother and two daugh|ters, were charged with here&s;y, for adhering to the reformed religion, and condemned to be burnt. One of them, named Perotine Ma&s;&s;ey, being big with child, the infant dropped from her womb into the fire, from which it was &s;natched alive, but after|wards ordered to be burnt with the a&s;hes of its mother. This i&s;le gives title of baron to the earl of Ailesford, and contains eight pari&s;hes.</P>

<HEAD>ALDERNEY.</HEAD>
<P>This i&s;le is about eight miles in compa&s;s, healthy and fruitful, both in corn and pa&s;ture, and is &s;eparated from France only by a narrow &s;ea or &s;treight called by the French, Les Ras de Blanchart, and by us, the Race of Alderney. In &s;tormy weather it is a dangerous pa&s;&s;age, but otherwi&s;e &s;afe enough. This i&s;land is an appendage of Guern&s;ey, and has but one &s;mall harbour. The inhabitants are in number about a thou&s;and, and live altogether in one town for their greater &s;afety. To the we&s;t lie tho&s;e dangerous Rocks, called the Ca&s;quets, extending about three leagues, on which the &s;ons of Henry I. were ca&s;t away in their pa&s;&s;age from Nor|mandy. It is &s;aid, that there is a common field of five hundred acres, which has not lain fallow the&s;e hundred years. The e&s;tates are divided equally among all the children here as in Jer&s;ey. Here al&s;o is a bailiff and other officers, from whom there lies an appeal to the courts of Guern&s;ey.</P>

There are only two pa&s;&s;ages or a&s;cents to it, and of the&s;e only one is practicable for carriages, being defended by two pieces of cannon. It is governed by a bailiff and other officers; but capi|tal offenders are tried at Guern&s;ey.</P>

<HEAD>BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>This county, deriving its name from its &s;ituation in re&s;pect of the other Saxons, and called Su&s;&s;ex, i. e. the country of the South Saxons, has Hamp&s;hire on the we&s;t, the Briti&s;h channel on the &s;outh, Surry on the north, and Kent on the ea&s;t. Its length is &s;ixty-five miles, its breadth twenty-nine, and its circumference one hundred and &s;eventy. It is divided into &s;ix rapes, and the&s;e into &s;ixty-five hundreds, in which are three hundred and twelve pari&s;hes, of which one hun|dred and twenty-three are vicarages, one city, eighteen market-towns, one thou&s;and and &s;ixty villages and hamlets, and about one hundred and twenty thou&s;and &s;ouls. It has few good ports tho' it lies along the channel for &s;ixty-five miles, which is its greate&s;t length, the coa&s;t being en|cumbered in many places with rocks; and where it is more open, &s;uch quantities of &s;and are thrown upon it by the &s;outh-we&s;t winds, and the harbours &s;o choaked up, that they will not admit ve&s;&s;els of any great draught or burden. The county is well watered by the rivers Arun, Adar, Ou&s;e, Rother,
<PB N="337" REF="3450">
Lavant, Cuckmeer, A&s;hburn, and Aften, by which it is well &s;upplied with fi&s;h, as well as from the &s;ea. Hence different places of the country are famed for different &s;orts of fi&s;h, as the Arun for mullets, which enter it from the &s;ea in &s;um|mer in &s;hoals, and by feeding upon a particular kind of herb, become extremely delicious, Chiche&s;ter for lob&s;ters, Sel&s;ey for cockles, Amberley for trout, Pulborough for eels, Rye for herrings, and the county in general for carp. It is remarkable that all the rivers abovementioned ri&s;e and fall into the &s;ea within the county.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The air, as well as the &s;oil, is various in dif|ferent parts of the county. Upon the coa&s;t the air is agui&s;h, upon the hills and downs plea&s;ant and whole&s;ome; but &s;omewhat moi&s;t and foggy in the valleys, the &s;oil being deep and rich, and the vegetation in &s;ummer very vigorous. The downs in &s;ome places are very fertile in corn and gra&s;s, in others they feed great flocks of &s;heep, who&s;e fle&s;h and wool are very fine; but of the latter no incon&s;iderable quantity is clande&s;|tinely exported to France. In the Weald and the vallies, the roads are very deep, e&s;pecially in winter. In the north quarter are many woods, and &s;ome fore&s;ts in other places; whence the king's yards are &s;upplied with the large&s;t and be&s;t timber in England, be&s;ide what is made into charcoal and con&s;umed in the iron works; for, on the ea&s;t-&s;ide, is plenty of iron ore, with furnaces, forges, and mills for manufacturing it. The gunpowder of this county is &s;aid to excel that of any other. Tho&s;e delicious birds called Wheat-ears are bred in this &s;hire: they are no bigger than a lark, but almo&s;t an entire lump of fat. That part now called
<PB N="338" REF="3460">
the Wild or Weald of Su&s;&s;ex was anciently a mere de&s;ert for hogs and deer, of great extent, taking in a part of Kent and Surrey, and was called Anderida Silva, Coid Andred, and Andrad&s;wald, from Ande|rida, an adjoining city. This county is in the home|circuit and dioce&s;e of Chiche&s;ter, giving title of earl to the family of Yelverton, and &s;ends twenty-eight members to parliament, viz. two for the county, two for the city of Chiche&s;ter, and two for each of the following towns, Hor&s;ham, Lewis, Bramber, Ea&s;t-Grin&s;tead, Midhur&s;t, Shoreham, Steyning, Arundel, Ha&s;tings, Rye, Winchel&s;ea, and Seaford; of which the four la&s;t are Cinque|ports.</P>

<HEAD>CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Chiche&s;ter, the capital, &s;tanding on the rivulet La|vant, in a plain, was the royal &s;eat and capital of the South Saxons, having been built by Ci&s;&s;a, one of their kings, and called Ci&s;&s;a Cea&s;ter or City. After the conque&s;t it was given to Roger de Mont|gomery, when bi&s;hop Stigand removed his &s;ee to it from Sel&s;ey. Both the city and cathedral were burnt down in the reign of Richard I. but re&s;tored by its bi&s;hop Selfrid or Saffred. The cathedral is not a large, but neat church, has a fine &s;pire, and is dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Its chapter con|&s;i&s;ts of a dean, thirty prebendaries, two archdeacons, a trea&s;urer, chancellor, chaunter, and twelve vicars choral. Many of the ornaments of the church were de&s;troyed in the civil wars: but the bi&s;hop's palace hath been lately rebuilt. The city is neat and com|pact, having four &s;treets an&s;wering to the four cardinal points, with four gates, and &s;urrounded by an old wall. It has a &s;tately cro&s;s in the market place; but the publick buildings are not extraordinary. Antiently there was a Franci&s;can convent here, and a ca&s;tle be|longing
<PB N="339" REF="3470">
to the earls of Arundel. It is a city and county of it&s;elf, the government being ve&s;ted in a mayor, recorder, aldermen, common-council with|out limitation, and four ju&s;tices of the peace, cho&s;en out of the aldermen. The mayor is attended by four &s;erjeants at mace and a crier, and is bal|lotted by the aldermen and common council, who nominate two per&s;ons. The principal manufactures of the town are malt and needles. The fine&s;t lob|&s;ters in England are bred in the Lavant. Its Saturdays market is noted for fi&s;h, wheat, barley, malt, and oats; and every Wedne&s;day fortnight there is a great market for cattle. At Deal key is a &s;mall harbour, where ve&s;&s;els come in and go out at high water, loaded with wheat, timber, coals, &amp;c. for Lon|don and ports on the coa&s;t. It is worth ob&s;erving, that the Lavant, unlike mo&s;t other rivers, is very low in winter, but in &s;ummer often overflows its banks. There is a delightful pro&s;pect from this city of the &s;ea and neighbouring country.</P>
<P>Hor&s;ham has its name from Hor&s;a, brother to Hengi&s;t the Saxon. Being one of the large&s;t towns of the county, the a&s;&s;izes are often held in it; and here is the county gaol, a very fine church, and free|&s;chool. There is a quarrey of very good &s;tone either for tiling or flooring in its neighbourhood; and its weekly market is well &s;upplied with provi&s;ions of all kinds, e&s;pecially poultry. The manor be|longed antiently to the dukes of Norfolk; but, being forfeited, was given to the ance&s;tor of the earls Delawar. It is a borough by pre&s;crip|tion, and is governed by two bailiffs, who are cho&s;en yearly by a jury, at the court-leet of the lord of the manor. The jury return four per&s;ons to the &s;teward, and he nominates two out of the four for the en&s;uing year. The members of parliament are cho&s;en by the bailiffs and burgage-holders.</P>
<P>Midhur&s;t derives its name from its having been antiently &s;urrounded with a wood. It is plea&s;antly

&s;ituated upon a hill, at the bottom of which runs the Arun; and, being a borough by pre&s;cription, is governed by a bailiff, cho&s;en annually by a jury at the court-leet of the lord of the manor. The Romans called it Midae. Tratton, in its neigh|bourhood, was the birth place of Otway the poet.</P>
<P>Lewis &s;tands upon a ri&s;ing ground at &s;ome di&s;tance from the &s;ea, and, for extent and po|pulou&s;ne&s;s, is one of the chief towns in the county. Here was formerly a ca&s;tle, and near it a priory for Cluniac monks, both of which were built, and the latter endowed, by William Warren, earl of Surry, and dedicated to St. Pancras. In the time of the Saxons there was a mint here. Afterwards in the reign of Henry III. a bloody battle was fought in its neighbourhood between the king and the barons, on which the king, tho' he gained &s;ome advantage at fir&s;t, was in the end entirely defeated. The town is hand&s;ome, with large &s;uburbs, and is plea&s;antly &s;ituated upon the edge of the South-downs. It is an antient borough by pre&s;cription, and is governed by con&s;tables cho&s;en yearly and alternately at the court-leet of three lords, viz. the duke of Dor&s;et, the duke of Nor|folk, and the lord Abergavenny. It drives a great trade, and goods are brought to the town in boats and barges from a port eight miles off on the river Ou&s;e. On this river is a con&s;iderable iron manufacture; and from a windmill near the town, is one of the fine&s;t pro&s;pects in the world.</P>
<P>Steyning, or Stening, is a poor &s;mall town, but a borough by pre&s;cription. The chief magi&s;trate is the con&s;table, who pre&s;ides over and deter|mines in elections of members of parliament. It was antiently a large town, and had a priory of black canons, afterwards converted into a college for a dean and &s;ecular canons. Here are &s;everal good fairs, particularly at Michaelmas, and a free
<PB N="341" REF="3490">
&s;chool founded by one Mr. Holland, a trade&s;man of the town. The ance&s;tors of earl Delawar ob|tained this manor al&s;o upon the attainder of John de Mowbray, duke of Norfolk. The land about the town is &s;o fruitful, that an acre often pro|duces thirty or forty bu&s;hels of wheat, and fifty of barley, and lets at a great price. As the pa&s;ture of the downs is particularly excellent for &s;heep, &s;o the mutton is extremely delicious. A charity of twenty-four pounds a year to this, and twenty-three other pari&s;hes, was given above one hundred years ago by Sir Barrick Hiltman; but, being limited to ninety-nine years, it is now expired.</P>
<P>Shoreham, Old and New, &s;tand upon the Adur, at the mouth of which was antiently the Portus Adurni, a good harbour, till it was barred up in a great mea&s;ure by &s;and-banks. It was here Ella, the Saxon, landed an army, with which he drove the Britons into the Weald, then a fore&s;t, and founded the kingdom of the South Saxons. This manor, al&s;o being forfeited by the duke of Norfolk, was given to the ance&s;tor of earl Delawar. New Shoreham is a populous place, governed by con|&s;tables, and has a good harbour, which has been lately greatly improved; but the old town is dwindled into a poor village. Here, on account of the plenty and cheapne&s;s of timber in the neighbouring country, and the conveniency of the river to bring it down, many artificers and trade&s;men in the &s;hip-building bu&s;ine&s;s are &s;ettled.</P>
<P>Ea&s;t-Grin&s;tead the Le&s;s has the epithet of Ea&s;t, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from We&s;t Grin&s;tead, a manor in the rape of Bramber, and of the Le&s;s, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the market-town of that name in this county. Here is an ho&s;pital built in the reign of James I. for thirty-one poor people, and endowed with three hundred and thirty pounds a year, by
<PB N="342" REF="3500">
the earl of Dor&s;et, who&s;e de&s;cendants, now dukes, are lords of the manor. Be&s;ides others, it has a great fair in November for Welch runts, fat hogs, and other cattle. It is a borough by pre|&s;cription; and the bailiff, who is the chief magi&s;|trate, and returning officer, is cho&s;en by a jury of burgage-holders at the duke of Dor&s;et's court-leet.</P>
<P>Bramber, or Bramborough cum Botolph. This borough and manor, which antiently belonged to the Brai&s;es, and after them to the Mowbrays, dukes of Norfolk, is now the e&s;tate of earl Delawar, who likewi&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the other manors that pertained to that family. Here was antiently a ca&s;tle, the ruins of which are &s;till vi&s;ible. Bram|ber and Steyning were repre&s;ented in parliament by the &s;ame members, till new Edward IV. but &s;ince that time they have had &s;eparate members. It is a borough by pre&s;cription, but a very poor one, and is governed by con&s;tables cho&s;en yearly by a jury at the court-leet of the lord of the ma|nor.</P>
<P>Arundel, famous for its excellent mullets, &s;eems to take its name from the river Arun, by which it &s;tands, upon the declivity of a hill, near the top of which is that famous ca&s;tle, which, in the Saxon times, is &s;aid to have been a mile in compa&s;s, and is now one of the duke of Norfolk's &s;eats. To this ca&s;tle is in&s;eparably annexed the manor, and al&s;o the title and dignity of earl; for in Henry VI's time, it was declared by act of parliament, that all who had been or &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the ca&s;tle and honour were, and &s;hould be, by vir|tue thereof, earls of Arundel. Formerly the fa|mily of Fitz-Alan, but now the dukes of Nor|folk, as lords of the manor and ca&s;tle, are earls of Arundel. The town is a borough by pre&s;crip|tion, governed by a mayor, twelve burge&s;&s;es, a &s;teward, and other inferior officers. The majority
<PB N="343" REF="3510">
of the inhabitants, paying &s;cot and lot, chu&s;e the mayor yearly at the court-leet of the lord of the manor. In the church are &s;everal monuments of the antient earls. The harbour was formerly a very good one, till it was choaked up with &s;and; but an act of parliament was pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome years ago for re&s;toring it.</P>
<P>Ha&s;tings, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to derive its name from Ha&s;tings, a Dani&s;h pirate, is the chief of the Cinque-ports, and, with its members, Winchel|&s;ea, Rye, &amp;c. was bound to find twenty-one &s;hips for any naval expedition; on which account, as well as the other ports, it enjoyed ample privileges and immunities. The &s;hips were not only to be com|pletely equipped, but manned each with twenty-one men well armed, who were to be maintained by the re&s;pective ports fifteen days, after which the king was obliged to keep them, if he had any further occa&s;ion for their &s;ervice. Notice was to be given to the &s;everal ports forty days before the &s;hips were wanted. The ports were at fir&s;t but five, and therefore called Cinque-ports, viz. Ha&s;tings, Dover, Hythe, Romney, and Sandwich, to which Winchel&s;ea and Rye were afterwards added as principals, and &s;ome other &s;mall towns as members. The lord-warden of the&s;e ports is always a no|bleman, and has the authority of admiral and chancellor within his juri&s;diction, be&s;ides other privileges. Their repre&s;entatives in parliament have the title of barons, who &s;upport the canopy at the king's coronation, and have a table &s;pread for them on the king's right-hand. Here, in the reign of Athel&s;tan, was a mint; and William the Conqueror mu&s;tered his army, after he had landed at Peven&s;ey, and burnt his fleet. This town had formerly a ca&s;tle, the ruins of which are &s;till vi&s;ible. Here is no harbour, but only an open
<PB N="344" REF="3520">
beach. The town is exempted from toll, and go|verned by a mayor and jurats, who have authority to judge in capital cau&s;es. Its members are Pe|ven&s;ey, Seaforth, Bulliver, Heath, Hidney, Beak&s;|burn, and Granger. The earls of Huntington have both their name and title of baron from it. A great quantity of the be&s;t fi&s;h caught here are &s;ent to London by land-carriage.</P>
<P>Rye, another of the Cinque-ports, is plea&s;antly &s;ituated at the extremity of the county towards Kent, on the &s;ide of a hill, and has a delightful pro&s;pect of the &s;ea, by which, and the river Ro|ther, it is almo&s;t &s;urrounded at high-water. The harbour is &s;o choaked up, that it will hardly admit the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;&s;els. A great quantity and variety of fi&s;h are caught here in their &s;ea&s;ons, particularly herrings and mackarel, and conveyed to London. Here is a free-&s;chool, and a con&s;iderable trade in hops, wool, timber, kettles, cannon, &amp;c. which are ca&s;t at the iron-works in the neighbourhood. It is a corporation by pre&s;cription, governed by a mayor and twelve jurats, and is well &s;upplied with water by leaden pipes from the neighbouring hills. Tenterden is its only member.</P>
<P>Winchel&s;ea is the third Cinque-port in this county. The &s;ea &s;wallowed up the old town, and retired from the new before it was quite fini&s;hed, in con&s;equence of which it is now &s;o decayed, that gra&s;s grows in the &s;treets. It appears to have been once a very large and hand&s;ome town, divided into thirty-two &s;quares, with three pari&s;h churches. Such al&s;o the old town &s;eems to have been, which &s;tood at the di&s;tance of two or three miles. Near the new was a ca&s;tle, now quite decay|ed, built by Henry VIII. In St. Leonard's, one of its three antient churches, was the &s;tatue of that &s;aint, the patron of the town, with a moveable vane in his hand, which being placed
<PB N="345" REF="3530">
again&s;t any particular quarter, they imagined would make the wind blow from thence.

<P>Battel had its name from the deci&s;ive battle here fought betwixt William the Conqueror and Ha|rold, for the crown of England. After the bat|tle, the conqueror erected an abbey on the &s;pot where it was fought, which he dedicated to St. Martin, and called Battle-abbey, ordering ma&s;s to be &s;aid for the &s;ouls of all that fell in the conflict, and be&s;towing great revenues and privi|leges upon it. Part of the charter run thus: "If any thief, murderer, or per&s;on guilty of any crime, fly for fear of death and come to the church,

let him have no harm, but be freely di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. Be it lawful al&s;o for the abbot of the &s;ame church to deliver from the gallows any thief or robber what&s;oever, if he chance to come by at the exe|cution." In a &s;hort time hou&s;es began to be built about the abbey, and this was the origin of the town of Battel. Nothing now remains of the abbey, though it was a mile in compa&s;s, and, no doubt, very magnificent, except the gate-hou&s;e, which is u&s;ed for the &s;e&s;&s;ions and other public meetings. The town has a harbour for barges; and the be&s;t gunpowder, perhaps in Europe, is made here. On a hill, near the town, formerly called Standard-hill, but now Beacon-hill, William the Conqueror &s;et up his &s;tandard of defiance be|fore the engagement.</P>
<P>Brighthelm&s;tone &s;tands fifty miles from Lon|don, and its &s;ituation is extremely plea&s;ant, being &s;urrounded on one &s;ide by the &s;ea, and on the others by beautiful pa&s;tures, or corn-fields, beyond which are charming downs, where va&s;t flocks of &s;heep, remarkable for their fine wool, are fed. This town has been much frequented lately for the &s;ake of bathing in the &s;ea, and drink|ing its water, for which every convenience and accommodation that can be wi&s;hed for, have been provided. The air is remarkably pure and &s;alubrious; le&s;s rain falls here than in any other part of England, and as there is no river or brook of any con&s;equence in the neighbourhood, the &s;ea|water is &s;trong and genuine, without mixture to weaken its efficacy. From hence Charles II. made his e&s;cape to France, having wandered about in the mo&s;t imminent danger &s;everal weeks after the battle of Worce&s;ter. Here barks and other &s;mall craft are built for the merchants of London, &amp;c. and the fi&s;hermen let them&s;elves out for the &s;ea|&s;on, to catch herrings for the people of Yar|mouth.

<HEAD>ANTIENT STATE, DIVISION, and GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<P>WALES, which was antiently of greater extent than it is at pre&s;ent, and com|prehended all the country beyond the Severn, that is, be&s;ides the twelve counties included in it at pre&s;ent, tho&s;e of Hereford&s;hire and Mon|mouth&s;hire, which now are reckoned a part of England, was then inhabited by three different tribes of the Britons, namely, the Silures, the Dimetae, and the Ordovices. The Romans were never able to &s;ubdue them, till the reign of Ve&s;pa&s;ian, when they were reduced by Julius Frontinus, who placed garri&s;ons in their country to keep them in awe. Tho' the Saxons made them|&s;elves ma&s;ters of all England, they never could get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Wales, except the counties of Monmouth&s;hire and Hereford&s;hire, formerly a part of Wales. About the year 870, Roderic, king of Wales, divided it among his three &s;ons:
<PB N="350" REF="3580">
and the names of the&s;e divi&s;ions were Demetia, or South-Wales; Pove&s;ia, or Powis-Land; and Venedotia, or North-Wales. Another divi&s;ion is mentioned afterwards in the Records, viz. North-Wales, South-Wales, and We&s;t-Wales, the la&s;t comprehending the counties of Monmouth and Hereford. The country derived the name of Wales, and the inhabitants that of Wel&s;h, from the Saxons, who, by tho&s;e terms, denote a coun|try and people to which they are &s;trangers; for the Wel&s;h, in their own language, call their country Cymry, and their language Cymraeg. They continued under their own princes and laws from the abovementioned period, and were never en|tirely &s;ubjected to the crown of England, till the reign of Edward I. when Llewellin ap Gryffith, prince of Wales, lo&s;t both his life and dominions. Edward, the better to &s;ecure his conque&s;t, and to reconcile the Wel&s;h to a foreign yoke, &s;ent his queen to lye-in at Caernarvon, where &s;he was delivered of a prince; to whom the Wel&s;h, on that account, the more readily &s;ubmitted. Ever &s;ince that time the elde&s;t &s;ons of the kings of Eng|land have commonly been created princes of Wales, and, as &s;uch, enjoy certain revenues from that country. But tho' Wales, from that time, was &s;ubject to the crown of England, yet it was not united and incorporated with it till the 27th of Henry VIII. when, by act of parliament, the go|vernment of it was modelled according to the Engli&s;h form; all laws, cu&s;toms, and tenures, con|trary to tho&s;e of England, being abrogated, and the inhabitants admitted to a participation of all the Engli&s;h liberties and privileges, particularly that of &s;ending members to parliament, viz. a knight for every &s;hire, and a burge&s;s for every &s;hire-town, except Merioneth. By other acts
<PB N="351" REF="3590">
made afterwards, the country was divided into four circuits, and two ju&s;tices were appointed for each, containing three counties; but at pre&s;ent there are only two circuits and four judges, two for each. In fine, the government here, both civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical, is now the &s;ame as that of England.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>CHARACTER and LANGUAGE.</HEAD>
<P>As to the character of the Wel&s;h, they are &s;aid to be a brave, ho&s;pitable people; and tho' very jealous of affronts, pa&s;&s;ionate, and ha&s;ty, yet are ea&s;ily reconciled. The common people look with a &s;u&s;picious eye on &s;trangers, and bear an here|ditary grudge to the Engli&s;h nation, by whom their ance&s;tors were expelled from the fine&s;t parts of the i&s;land. The gentlemen are apt to value them&s;elves upon the antiquity of their families, and with &s;ome rea&s;on, as they can generally trace them much higher than the inhabitants of mo&s;t other countries.</P>
<P>All the better &s;ort, both in town and country, can &s;peak Engli&s;h, e&s;pecially in the counties bor|dering upon England. The common people, in general, only &s;peak their own language, which is the antient Briti&s;h, and not only differs entirely from the Engli&s;h, but has very little affi|nity with any of the we&s;tern tongues, unle&s;s we &s;hould except the Galic, Er&s;e, or Iri&s;h. It is &s;aid to be a dialect of the antient Celtic or Gome|rian, and in many re&s;pects to re&s;emble the He|brew. Mo&s;t of the clergy are natives of the country, and under&s;tand Engli&s;h &s;o well, that they could exerci&s;e their functions in any part of Britain. The public wor&s;hip, however, is as often performed in Wel&s;h as in Engli&s;h, ex|cepting in the towns, where the latter is the pre|vailing language; nay there, even mo&s;t of the

meaner &s;ort under&s;tand it. No country perhaps in Europe, Scotland excepted, &s;ends abroad &s;o great a number of &s;cholars, in proportion to its extent; for there is hardly a town in Wales with|out a free-&s;chool. The ignorance which formerly prevailed among the poorer &s;ort, e&s;pecially the colliers, is now in a great mea&s;ure removed by the circulating &s;chools, and other laudable mea&s;ures, employed by the worthy Society for propagating Chri&s;tian knowledge. By the circulating &s;chools are meant certain &s;chool-ma&s;ters, who travel from one place to another, in&s;tructing both old and young in reading, praying, and the principles of our mo&s;t holy religion. In the year 1749, the number of the&s;e &s;chool-ma&s;ters amount|ed to one hundred and forty-two, and the per&s;ons in&s;tructed by them to &s;eventy-two thou&s;and two hundred and &s;ixty-four. The&s;e u&s;eful in&s;titutions depend on the liberality of well-di&s;po&s;ed people. The &s;ociety for promoting Chri&s;tian knowledge lay out con&s;iderable &s;ums in printing good books for the u&s;e of the Wel&s;h. The inhabitants, who are computed at about three hundred thou&s;and, are not, in general, wealthy, tho' the land tax of Wales brings in forty-three thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-two pounds.</P>

The place where it ri&s;es, is enclo&s;ed in the form of a bath, about twelve feet long by &s;ix or &s;even wide, over which has been built by the monks of former ages, a mo&s;t curious and venerable Gothic &s;tructure, in honour of the &s;aint who fir&s;t be&s;towed her bene|diction on the &s;pring. It is an excellent cold bath, and when it proves &s;erviceable as &s;uch, its &s;itua|tion, under &s;uch a venerable &s;uper&s;tructure, is a circum&s;tance &s;ufficient to po&s;&s;e&s;s the minds of the &s;uper&s;titious and credulous with the belief of a &s;upernatural cure.

The &s;oil is but poor upon the hills, though they produce pa&s;ture &s;ufficient to feed numerous flocks of &s;heep and goats; but in the vallies the &s;oil is rich, and yields plenty of corn and pa&s;|ture for black cattle.

The town is a corporation, con&s;i&s;ting of a mayor, aldermen, a coroner, two bailiffs, and thirteen common-coun|cil-men, has a hand&s;ome church, a gaol for the county, and a public hall, in which the town and county bu&s;ine&s;s is tran&s;acted, and the a&s;&s;izes held.

to Ireland, to which, and other places, it ex|ports a great deal of lead. This town gives title of earl to the noble family of Brudenel, now advanced to that of duke of Montagu. The member return|ed to parliament is cho&s;en by this and four other boroughs jointly. In 1727, the town and pari&s;h paid only twenty-two pounds &s;ix &s;hillings and eight|pence towards the land-tax, when it was at four &s;hillings in the pound. Cardigan bay is a large gulph of the &s;ea, the mouth of it extending from Cardi|gan point to Bar&s;ey-i&s;land, about twelve leagues. Ships bound to or from Ireland often take &s;helter here in &s;tre&s;s of weather, and there is good riding in &s;everal parts of it, according to the winds; but the only tolerable haven is that called Traeth haven, lying in a branch of it named Pullhelly|bay.</P>

<P>The air of Pembroke&s;hire, con&s;idering its &s;itu|ation, is good; but it is in general better the farther from the &s;ea. As there are but few moun|tains, the &s;oil is generally fruitful, e&s;pecially on the &s;ea coa&s;ts; nor are its mountains altogether unprofitable, but produce pa&s;ture &s;ufficient to main|tain great numbers of &s;heep and goats.

The inhabitants of this county make a very plea&s;ant durable fire of culm, which is the du&s;t of coal made up into balls, with a third part of mud. The county is well watered by the rivers Clethy, Dougledye, Cled|hew, and Teive, which la&s;t parts it from Cardi|gan&s;hire.

<P>Pembroke is the county-town, and &s;tands on a creek of Milford-haven, over which it has two hand&s;ome bridges. It had antiently a ca&s;tle, in which Hen. VII. was born, and was &s;urrounded with walls; but both are now gone to decay. The town is a corporation, and gives title of earl to the noble family of Herbert, as well as Montgomery. It is the large&s;t town next to Caermarthen in Wales, as well as the mo&s;t wealthy; and its trade is &s;o con&s;iderable, that it employs near two hundred &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els on its own account. There are two churches and a cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, and the &s;ea at every tide flows up to its walls.</P>
<P>Milford-haven is one of the fine&s;t harbours in Europe, and the be&s;t in the three kingdoms. It lies on the north-&s;ide near the mouth of the Bri&s;tol channel, and is very large, &s;afe, and deep. There is no danger nor difficulty in going in or out with the tide, or almo&s;t any wind. If a &s;hip comes in without a cable or anchor, &s;he may run a&s;hore on the ooze, and there lie &s;afe till &s;he is refitted, and in an hour's time &s;he may get out of the harbour into the open &s;ea. It lies extremely convenient

Here was antiently a priory and a ca&s;tle, the town being &s;trongly walled. It is now a corporation and county of it&s;elf, governed by a mayor and aldermen, who compo&s;e a common|council, a &s;heriff, town-clerk, two bailiffs, and other inferior officers. The mayor is admiral, coroner, e&s;cheator, and clerk of the markets with|in the liberties of the town. Here is the county gaol, and here the a&s;&s;izes are kept.

Both the town and promontory had their names from Dewi, or David, who was archbi&s;hop of Caerleon, but tran&s;lated the archi|epi&s;copal dignity hither in king Arthur's days. This &s;ame David gave ri&s;e to the cu&s;tom &s;till ob|&s;erved by the Wel&s;h, of wearing a leak in their

It appears to have been antiently a con&s;iderable city; but afterwards &s;uffered &s;o much by the lo&s;s of the archiepi&s;copal dignity, and by the ravages of Saxons, Danes, and pirates, that it was at la&s;t quite reduced, and is now almo&s;t de&s;erted, tho' &s;till the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, who has a palace and cathedral, which is a vene|rable old building.

From the promontory in a clear day, Ireland may be &s;een very di&s;tinct, being only forty miles di&s;tant. A little off the extremity of the promontory or head are tho&s;e rocks, infamous for &s;hipwrecks, called the Bi&s;hop and his clerks. Great flights of birds of various kinds re&s;ort to them in the &s;pring to breed. Among the&s;e are the puffins and tho&s;e called Harry - birds, which breed in holes like rabbits, and are taken with nets. Others lay and hatch their eggs on the bare rocks. It is remark|able,

<P>In the pari&s;h of Lhan Newydh, or New Church, near Caermarthen, is a &s;tone pillar with this in|&s;cription: <HI>&s;epulchrum Severini filii Severi.</HI> This pa|ri&s;h is noted for having been the re&s;idence of the ance&s;tors of Oliver Cromwell. His great-grand|father was Morgan Williams, e&s;quire, of this pari&s;h, who marrying a &s;i&s;ter of Thomas Crom|well, earl of E&s;&s;ex, had by her Sir Richard Wil|liams, who changed his name to Cromwell, and was the great grandfather of the Protector.</P>
<P>At a place called Brony Scawen, in Lhan Boy|dy pari&s;h, above two hundred coins, all of &s;ilver, and &s;ome of the mo&s;t antient ever found in Britain, were di&s;covered in 1692, by two &s;hepherd boys in two leaden boxes, very near the &s;urface of the ground, at the entry of a &s;pacious camp called Y Gaer. This camp is of an oval form, about three hundred paces in circumference, with a rampire between two and three yards in height, and a tumulus or barrow on each &s;ide of it.</P>
<P>Near Caermarthen, towards the ea&s;t, may be &s;een the ruins of Ka&s;telk Karreg, which was &s;ituated on a &s;teep inacce&s;&s;ible rock; and al&s;o &s;e|veral va&s;t caverns, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been copper|mines of the Romans.

about one hundred and &s;ixteen, containing five hundred and forty thou&s;and acres, fifty-eight thou&s;and inhabitants, ten hundreds, as many mar|ket-towns, and eighteen pari&s;hes.

Its commodities are black cattle, &s;heep, coals, lead, fi&s;h, and butter. The chief rivers of this county, which altogether amount to &s;ixteen, are the Rhymney or Remney, the Taff, the Ogmore, the Avon, the Cledaugh, and the Tavye.</P>

<P>Cardiff, the capital, the Briti&s;h name of which is Caer-Dyeth, &s;tands on the Tavye or Taff, about four miles from its mouth, where there is a good harbour; but only &s;mall ve&s;&s;els come up to the town. In the reign of William Ru|fus, one Fitz-Harmon; a Norman, got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this town and county, having been invit|ed to its a&s;&s;i&s;tance by Ju&s;tin ap Gwyrgant, who had revolted from his own prince; but after
<PB N="388" REF="3960">
Fitz-Harmon had defeated Rhys ap Tewdwr, prince of Wales, he di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Ju&s;tin ap Gwyr|gant, and divided the country among his followers. The town is pretty large, has &s;everal fairs for corn, cattle, &s;heep, hor&s;es, and &s;wine, and plentiful mar|kets. Here is a &s;trong, &s;tately, &s;pacious ca&s;tle, in which the a&s;&s;izes are held, and the audit for the e&s;tate of the earl of Pembroke. The town has a good trade, e&s;pecially with Bri&s;tol, and is governed by the con&s;table of the ca&s;tle, who is the earl of Pembroke, or his deputy, two bailiffs, who hold a court of record every fortnight, and are ju&s;tices of the peace, twelve aldermen, as many ca|pital burge&s;&s;es, a &s;teward, town-clerk, &amp;c. It is &s;aid to be the mo&s;t beautiful town in all South Wales, &s;tanding in a level fruitful &s;oil, and encom|pa&s;&s;ed, at a little di&s;tance, with plea&s;ant hills. Ro|bert Curtho&s;e died a pri&s;oner in the ca&s;tle of Cardiff anno 1134, after having had his eyes put out by his brother. In this, as in mo&s;t other towns, were antiently &s;everal convents.</P>
<P>Llandaff is a bi&s;hop's &s;ee, the dioce&s;e of which comprehends one hundred and &s;eventy-&s;even pa|ri&s;hes. Its cathedral, a &s;tately &s;tructure, was fir&s;t built by the Gallic bi&s;hops Germanus and Lupus, when they came over to &s;uppre&s;s the Pelagian he|re&s;y, and dedicated to St. Talio; but the pre&s;ent edifice was erected by bi&s;hop Urban near &s;even hundred years ago. This, though a very antient bi&s;hopric, is extremely poor, a circum&s;tance owing to one of its bi&s;hops, who is &s;aid to have alienated part of its revenues in the reign of Henry VIII. The city is very mean, &s;ituated in a bottom at the mouth of the Taff, as its Wel&s;h name part|ly intimates; for it &s;ignifies a church upon the Taff. At a little di&s;tance from hence is a &s;mall i&s;land, called Barry from St. Baruch, who lies bu|ried there, which gave both name and origin to
<PB N="389" REF="3970">
the family of the earl of Barrymore in Ireland, once proprietors of it. At Worm&s;head point, a good way farther to the we&s;t, is a &s;mall clift or crevice in the ground, into which, if a handful of du&s;t or &s;and is thrown, it will be blown back into the air; and if a per&s;on lies down, and lays his ear to it, he will hear di&s;tinctly a hollow noi&s;e like that of a prodigious large pair of bellows, occa&s;ioned by the reciprocal motion of the &s;ea, under the arched and rocky hollow of the headland.</P>
<P>Cowbridge &s;tands on the river Ewenny, not far from its mouth. From a &s;tone bridge over this river, it is called by the Wel&s;h Pontvaen. It has a harbour for boats, and a good market for corn, cattle, and &s;heep. The chief magi&s;trate is a bailiff cho&s;en annually, and &s;worn into his office by the earl of Pembroke's deputy-con&s;table of the neigh|bouring ca&s;tle of St. Quintin.</P>
<P>At Newton, in this neighbourhood, is a very particular &s;ort of fountain, which, at high water, is very low, but at ebb is full to the brim, tho' it never overflows. The&s;e effects are &s;uppo&s;ed to be occa&s;ioned by the air, which at full &s;ea not having vent, &s;tops the &s;ources of the &s;pring, but at low water finds a pa&s;&s;age, and no longer con|fines it. Not far from hence is Boverton, &s;up|po&s;ed to be the Bovium of Antoninus.</P>
<P>Neath, in Briti&s;h Nedh, is a pretty large old town on a river of the &s;ame name, over which it has a &s;tone bridge. The trade of the place con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in the exportation of coals, which are found in great plenty in the neighbouring hills. It is governed by a portreve, cho&s;en annually and &s;worn in by the deputy-con&s;table of the ca&s;tle. Betwixt this and Cardiff is a large bay called Cardiff-bay; and on the other &s;ide of the river are the ruins of a &s;tately abbey, and a very antient

It is a large well built town, has an exceeding good harbour, and a great trade, e&s;pecially in coals and culm, of which there are inexhau&s;tible pits in the neighbourhood. It is governed by a portreve, and its markets are well &s;upplied. The country betwixt the rivers Neath and Lochor is called Gowerland, and is divided into ea&s;t and we&s;t, in the former of which &s;tands this town.</P>

<P>About four miles from the Rhymny, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the county, is Caerphili-ca&s;tle, which, from its magnitude and admirable &s;tructure, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been a Roman garri&s;on, and is probably the noble&s;t ruin of antient architecture now remaining in Britain; for it exceeds all the mo&s;t noted ca&s;tles in England in &s;ize, that of Wind|&s;or excepted.

<HEAD>BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS i&s;land was di&s;tingui&s;hed antiently by &s;everal appellations, as Mona, Monoeda, Mo|nabia, Menavia, Eubonia, Manaw, &amp;c. but its pre&s;ent name is probably derived from the Saxon Mang, &s;ignifying among, as lying in St. George's channel, between the kingdoms of England, Scot|land, and Ireland, and nearly at an equal di&s;tance from all three. Its length from north to &s;outh is about thirty miles, its breadth from eight to fif|teen, and the latitude of the middle of the i&s;land is 54 deg. 16 min. north.</P>

<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>That the air is pure and whole&s;ome appears to a demon&s;tration from the longevity of the inhabi|tants. The winters are longer and more &s;evere than on the continent of England, and the &s;um|mers &s;horter and cooler; but the weather is le&s;s vari|able in both &s;ea&s;ons. High winds, indeed, are more common than in England, but rains much le&s;s &s;o. In the northern parts, where the chief mountains lie, the &s;oil is barren, heathy, and gravelly; but towards the &s;outh, it is very good, yielding wheat, barley, oats, rye, flax, hemp, roots, and pul&s;e. A ridge of mountains runs almo&s;t the whole length of the i&s;land, which though very bleak, yet furni&s;hes the inhabitants with plenty
<PB N="402" REF="4100">
of excellent water, with peat and turf for fuel; and the vallies that lie among them afford good pa&s;ture, corn, and hay. The i&s;land breeds abun|dance of black cattle, which are &s;maller than tho&s;e of England, as are mo&s;t of the other animals com|mon to the two countries. The gentry have good hor&s;es both for draught and &s;addle; be&s;ides which, there is a &s;mall &s;ort bred in the moun|tains, very &s;wift and hardy. There are no badgers, foxes, otters, pole-cats, moles, hedge|hogs, or &s;nakes on the i&s;land, or any other noxi|ous animals; and till &s;ome &s;pawn was brought over from Ireland, there were no frogs. In the mountains great numbers of hogs and &s;heep are bred, of both which the meat is &s;aid to be excel|lent. They run wild, and are never hou&s;ed. Of the &s;heep, &s;ome are of a buff colour, who&s;e wool is tolerably fine, and makes a pretty colour with|out any dye. Here is an airy of eagles, and &s;everal of a mottled kind of hawks. Hence it was, that Henry IV. when he granted it to Sir John Stanley, and his heirs, obliged them, in lieu of all other &s;ervices, to pre&s;ent him and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors with a ca&s;t of falcons on the day of their coronation. On the &s;outh coa&s;t there is a &s;mall i&s;land, called the Calf of Man, about three miles in circumference, &s;eparated from the i&s;le of Man by a narrow channel. About the rocks of this little i&s;le an incredible number of all &s;orts of &s;ea fowl breed. At this place are al&s;o found bar|nacles, or claik-gee&s;e, and puffins, which breed in rabbit-holes, and of who&s;e young, when they begin to fly, about the middle of Augu&s;t, not le&s;s than four or five thou&s;and are hunted and taken. They are almo&s;t one lump of fat. Some pickle them with wine, &s;pice, and other ingre|dients, and &s;end them abroad as pre&s;ents; but the greate&s;t part are con&s;umed at home. There
<PB N="403" REF="4110">
are no coal mines in the i&s;land; but &s;ome of iron, lead, and copper, though not wrought. It abounds in marble, &s;late, &s;tone, and other materials for building, together with lime-&s;tone, of which and marle great quantities are u&s;ed in manuring the ground.</P>

This i&s;land, till lately, might have been ju&s;tly called a magazine, or warehou&s;e, for &s;mugglers; for as there was little or no cu&s;tom paid, wine and brandy from France, rum from the We&s;t Indies, callicoes, teas, and other Ea&s;t India goods, from Holland, Denmark, and Sweden, were landed here, laid up in warehou&s;es, and afterwards run in &s;mall boats into Ireland, England, and Scotland: but &s;ince the royalty of the i&s;land hath been purcha&s;ed by the government of the duke of Athol, who was lord of it, that pernicious &s;muggling - bu&s;ine&s;s hath been almo&s;t totally &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.

<HEAD>HISTORY, GOVERNMENT, and CONSTITUTION.</HEAD>
<P>The i&s;land was fir&s;t inhabited by the Britons, and then by the Scots. Afterwards the Norwe|gians
<PB N="404" REF="4120">
di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Scots of it and the we&s;tern i&s;les, and appointed governors of them, who ge|nerally re&s;ided in the I&s;le of Man, and took the title of King of Man and the I&s;les. This royalty continued till 1266, when Magnus, king of Norway, &s;urrendered it to Alexander III. of Scot|land, for four thou&s;and marks, to be paid in four years, and an hundred marks yearly: but at la&s;t, about the latter end of Edward I. or beginning of Edward II's. reign, it fell into the hands of the Engli&s;h, and has ever &s;ince continued under their juri&s;diction. It had &s;everal lords before Henry IV. granted it, with the patronage of the bi&s;hopric, to Sir John Stanley and his heirs. Upon the death of the la&s;t lord Derby, without i&s;&s;ue male, it devolved to the duke of Athol, who had mar|ried his &s;i&s;ter; but hath been lately re-annexed to the crown by purcha&s;e, to which there is now a governor and garri&s;on appointed by the king, with officers of the cu&s;toms, &amp;c. As the king is now in place of the lord, he has the &s;ame rights, powers, and prerogatives, &s;uch as giving the final a&s;&s;ent to all laws; the power of pardoning offen|ders; of changing the &s;entence of death into ban|i&s;hment; of appointing and di&s;placing the gover|nor and officers, civil and military, with a right to all forfeitures for trea&s;on, felony, &s;uicide; to ten &s;hillings out of every boat which takes above ten mae&s;e of herrings, every mae&s;e being five hundred, &amp;c. be&s;ides the rents, fines, and &s;ervices, to which all landed e&s;tates are &s;ubject. The governor re&s;ides at Ca&s;tle-town, where he has a hand&s;ome hou&s;e, &s;alary, and other conveniences befitting his &s;tation. He is to take care that all officers, civil and military, do their duty. To him, as chancellor, there lies an appeal in matters of right and wrong, and from him to the king in council. The form of the governor's oath was antiently &s;omewhat &s;ingu|lar.
<PB N="405" REF="4130">
<Q>He &s;wore to do right betwixt the lord and his people, &startq;as uprightly as the &s;taff (the en&s;ign of his authority) now &s;tood in his hand,&endq; that it might be a con&s;tant monitor to him of the obli|gations he lies under.</Q> Formerly the temporal judges, called deem&s;ters, determined cau&s;es ac|cording to their con&s;ciences or be&s;t judgment, having no written laws, and the&s;e deci&s;ions were called brea&s;t-laws; but afterwards the&s;e judges were ordered to write down all deci&s;ions in intri|cated and important matters, that they might &s;erve as precedents and rules in future determina|tions; and that their judgments might be the more conformable to equity, they were enjoined to take the advice of the council, and twenty-four keys of the i&s;land, before they pronounced them. The &s;u|preme court, or a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates of the i&s;land, called the tinwald, from ting, a court of ju&s;tice, and wald, fenced, is held on a hill near the middle of the i&s;land in the open air. This a&s;&s;embly con&s;i&s;ts of the governor, officers &s;piri|tual and temporal, deem&s;ters, and the twenty-four keys, and is held once a-year. Here any per&s;on has a right to pre&s;ent any uncommon grie|vance, and to have his complaint heard and redre&s;&s;ed in the face of the whole country. In this court al&s;o all new laws are to be publi&s;hed after they have been agreed to by the governor, council, deem&s;ters, and the twenty-four keys, and have obtained the royal a&s;&s;ent. The council con&s;i&s;ts of the gover|nor, bi&s;hop, archdeacon, the two vicars-general, the receiver-general, the comptroller, the bailiff, and the attorney-general. The twenty-four keys, &s;o called, it is &s;aid from unlocking, as it were, or &s;olving the difficulties of the law, repre&s;ent the commons in making all new laws, and a&s;&s;i&s;t the deem&s;ters in interpreting them, and deciding all difficult ca&s;es. The two deem&s;ters are the temporal judges,
<PB N="406" REF="4140">
both in civil and criminal cau&s;es; but matters of &s;mall moment they determine at their hou&s;es. <Q>The deem&s;ter's oath is pretty &s;ingular: he &s;wears to do ju&s;tice &startq;as equally between man and man, as the herring bone lies between the two &s;ides;&endq; that their daily food, as that fi&s;h was antiently, might put them in mind of the &s;olemn engagements they had entered into.</Q> The i&s;land, with regard to its civil concerns, is divided into &s;ix &s;headings, each of which has its coroner, who, in the name of the &s;heriff, is entru&s;ted with the peace of his di&s;trict, &s;e|cures criminals, and brings them to ju&s;tice. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there is a moar and captain for every pari&s;h. The moars, who are changed yearly, are the king's bailiffs, and are an&s;werable for the rents in their re&s;pective divi&s;ions; and the captains have the care of the militia or train-bands.</P>

<HEAD>RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>The religion and wor&s;hip of the inhabitants are the &s;ame as the members of the church of England, Chri&s;tianity was fir&s;t planted here by St. Patrick a|bout the year 440. The cathedral is dedicated to St. Germain, who was the fir&s;t bi&s;hop of the i&s;le. About the beginning of the eleventh century, when the Norwegians had made a conque&s;t of this and the we&s;tern i&s;les, the &s;ee of Sodor, con|taining mo&s;t of tho&s;e i&s;lands, was united to that of Man, and &s;o continued till finally an|nexed to the crown of England, about the end of the reign of Edward I. when, notwith&s;tand|ing the bi&s;hopric was now confined to the i&s;le, the bi&s;hops &s;till continue to &s;tile them&s;elves of Sodor and Man. The cathedral &s;tands in the i&s;le of Peele; but the bi&s;hop re&s;ides in the village of Balrury, in Kirkmichael pari&s;h, where he has a good palace, chapel, and gardens. Since the
<PB N="407" REF="4150">
late purcha&s;e, the king has the nomination of the bi&s;hop, who is &s;ubject to the juri&s;diction of the archbi&s;hop of York. He has no &s;eat in parlia|ment; but has privileges &s;uperior to tho&s;e of mo&s;t other bi&s;hops in his own dioce&s;e, and &s;its uppermo&s;t in the lower hou&s;e of convocation. The eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal courts are held by the bi&s;hop, either in per&s;on, or by his vicars-general; or by the archdeacon in per&s;on, or by his official. There are &s;eventeen pari&s;h churches and four chapels in the four market-towns. All the livings, which are now pretty good, in con&s;equence of certain augmen|tations procured by the worthy Dr. I&s;aac Barrow, (who was bi&s;hop of Man, in the reign of Charles II.) except four, and the archdeaconry, were in the gift of the lord of the i&s;le, and now in the king's. Eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;cipline is here maintained very &s;trictly according to the canons; and the better to &s;ecure it, the bi&s;hop calls a convocation of his clergy, at lea&s;t once a-year, in order to enquire how the di&s;cipline of the church has been ob&s;erved, and to make &s;uch con&s;titutions as are nece&s;&s;ary for its better government. In all the courts of this i&s;land, eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil, both men and wo|men, who are natives of the i&s;land, u&s;ually plead their own cau&s;es. Strangers being unacquainted with the laws and language, are forced to employ others to &s;peak for them: and as it is not long &s;ince there were any attornies, law-&s;uits in con&s;equence were determined without much charge. There are no papi&s;ts natives of the i&s;land, nor di&s;&s;enters of any other denomination, except a few quakers.</P>
<P>If a bi&s;hop's tenant is found guilty of a capital crime, (for which he may be tried in the bi&s;hop's court, and by a jury of his tenants) he forfeits his lands to the bi&s;hop, but his per&s;on and moveables are at the king's di&s;po&s;al.</P>

<HEAD>MANNERS and CUSTOMS of the INHABITANTS.</HEAD>
<P>The number of the inhabitants is about twenty thou&s;and. They are a very quiet, orderly &s;ort of people, charitable to the poor, courteous to &s;trangers, and very tenacious of their antient laws, liberties, and tenures. Antiently the women ne|ver &s;tirred abroad without their winding &s;heets, to put them in mind of their mortality; and when a female was &s;entenced to die for any heinous crime, &s;he was &s;ewed up in a &s;ack, and thrown from a rock into the &s;ea. The better &s;ort have good &s;ub&s;tantial hou&s;es of &s;tone, covered with &s;late; but tho&s;e of the poorer people are thatched, which they &s;ecure again&s;t the winds by a net made of ropes of &s;traw. They improve their lands with lime, &s;ea-weed, or by folding their cattle and &s;heep in little enclo&s;ures of turf; the &s;paces within which are &s;o enriched by their dung and urine, that they yield very good crops of corn. The common bread of the country is made of oatmeal, as in Scotland and Lanca&s;hire. If there is no &s;ons, the elde&s;t daughter inherits the lands and tenements, tho'there be more children. The wives, at their deaths, may di&s;po&s;e of one half of the goods, moveable and immoveable, notwith|&s;tanding their hu&s;bands are alive, except in the &s;ix
<PB N="409" REF="4170">
northern pari&s;hes, where they can only di&s;po&s;e of a third, if they have had children. The women of the &s;outh are &s;aid to have obtained this &s;uperior pri|vilege for a&s;&s;i&s;ting their hu&s;bands in a day of battle. A widow has one half of her hu&s;band's real e&s;tate, if &s;he be his fir&s;t wife, and one quarter if &s;he be the &s;econd or third; but if any widow mar|ries or mi&s;carries, &s;he lo&s;es her widow-right in her hu&s;band's e&s;tate. A child got before marriage &s;hall inherit, provided the marriage follows within a-year or two, and the woman has never been de|famed with regard to any other man. The executors of &s;piritual men have a right to the years profits, if they live till after twelve o'clock on Ea&s;ter-day. If a &s;ingle woman pro&s;ecutes a &s;ingle man for a rape, and he is found guilty, the deem&s;ter de|livers to the woman a rope, a &s;word, and a ring, and &s;he has it in her choice to have him hanged or beheaded, or to &s;ave his life by marrying him. If any man gets a farmer's daughter with child, he mu&s;t either marry her, or endow her with &s;uch a portion as her father would have given her. No man can alienate his e&s;tate, without the con&s;ent of the governor and other officers. When any per&s;on is to be &s;ummoned before a magi&s;trate, he makes a mark upon a &s;late, generally the initials of the per&s;on's name. This is given to the proper officer with two-pence, who &s;hews it to the per&s;on to be &s;ummoned, with the time when he is to appear, and at who&s;e &s;uit. If he refu&s;es to obey, he is fined or committed to pri&s;on, till he gives bond to obey and pay co&s;ts. It is worthy ob&s;ervation here, as &s;omething &s;ingular, that the clergy of this i&s;land, in &s;peaking or writing to them, are dignified like our knights and baronets with the title of Sir prefixed to their Chri&s;tian names.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>Its NAME.</HEAD>
<P>THE antient names of this i&s;land were Hi|bernia, Juverna, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, Ierna, together with Iris, Iverdhon, and Ireland, which are all derived, according to Cambden, from Erin, the name by which it is known in the language of the antient natives. There are other derivations; but they &s;eem more forced and farther fetched. As to the name Erin, Cambden thinks it is derived from the Iri&s;h word Hiere, &s;ignifying the we&s;t, or a tract or country we&s;tward; &s;uch being the &s;ituation of Ireland in re&s;pect of England and the continent of Europe. This country was al&s;o formerly &s;tiled Scotia, or Scotland, and the in|habitants Scots.</P>

<HEAD>BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>Ireland is &s;ituated between the 5th and 10th de|grees of we&s;t longitude, and between the 51&s;t and
<PB N="413" REF="4210">
56th north latitude. The longe&s;t day in the &s;outh parts is &s;ixteen hours and a half, and in the north &s;eventeen hours and a quarter. It has the Deuca|lidonian &s;ea on the north and north-ea&s;t; the At|lantic ocean on the we&s;t; the Iri&s;h channel or &s;ea, commonly called St. George's channel, on the ea&s;t, dividing it from part of Scotland and England; and on the &s;outh the mouth of St. George's chan|nel, called &s;ometimes the Virgivian &s;ea. It is about twenty-three miles di&s;tant from Port Pa|trick in the county of Galway, in Scotland; about one hundred and fifty from Park-gate, near We&s;t-Che&s;ter; about &s;eventy from Holyhead, in An|gle&s;ey; as many from St. David's, in Pembroke|&s;hire; and from Bri&s;tol about two hundred. The number of inhabitants is computed at two millions five hundred thou&s;and. It extends about three hundred miles in length where longe&s;t, and one hundred and fifty in breadth where broade&s;t. Its circumference is reckoned at one thou&s;and four hundred miles, and its &s;uperficial contents at eleven millions &s;ixty-&s;even thou&s;and &s;even hundred and twelve Iri&s;h, or &s;eventeen millions nine hundred and twenty-&s;even thou&s;and eight hundred and &s;ixty-four Engli&s;h acres.

<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>Before the mar&s;hes were drained, and many of the woods cut down, the air was very damp, thick, and foggy, and apt to occa&s;ion fluxes and rheums, e&s;pecially among &s;trangers; but now it is reckon|ed, in general, pure and healthful, tho' &s;till in|ferior, in that re&s;pect, to the &s;outh of Eng|land, the &s;oil not being near &s;o well drained or cultivated: however, it is at lea&s;t equally mild
<PB N="414" REF="4220">
and temperate, neither the heat of &s;ummer nor the cold of winter being ever very violent; and wind, clouds, and rain, much more common than fro&s;t and &s;now. The air is now continually growing better, as the indu&s;try of the inhabitants increa&s;es, and the remaining bogs and fenny grounds are drained. The coolne&s;s of it however in &s;ummer is attended with this di&s;advantage, that the corn and fruits are not &s;o &s;oon nor &s;o thorough|ly ripened as in England. Again&s;t the moi&s;ture of the air, and its ill effects, the lower &s;ort of people endeavour to defend them&s;elves by the copious u&s;e of u&s;quebaugh. It is &s;aid no ve|nomous creatures, as &s;nakes, toads, &s;piders, nor moles, will live here, and that the wood of the fore&s;ts breeds no worms. The &s;oil of Ireland is abundantly fruitful both in corn and gra&s;s, e&s;|pecially the latter; in con&s;equence of which an infinite number of &s;heep and black cattle are bred particularly in the province of Connaught; and beef makes a very con&s;iderable article in their exports. The meadows yield the fine&s;t gra&s;s for hay, of which va&s;t quantities are made, or rather &s;poiled, to fodder their black cattle, &s;heep, and hor&s;es, in winter. Few countries produce finer grain than what grows in the well cul|tivated parts of Ireland. Tho' many bogs have been drained, yet numbers &s;till remain. They are of &s;everal &s;orts. Some are covered with gra&s;s, &s;ome with reeds and ru&s;hes, and &s;ome with little &s;hrubs, inter&s;per&s;ed with water. Some yield plenty of very good turf. In others, called red bogs, large fir and other trees are often found. There are but few woods now in this country.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;I make no doubt, &s;ays an ingenious gentle|man that lately vi&s;ited Ireland, but there is as much wood and timber growing in the county of
<PB N="415" REF="4230">
Kent, as in the whole kingdom of Ireland.&endq;</Q> The northern and ea&s;tern counties are the be&s;t culti|vated and enclo&s;ed, the mo&s;t fertile, populous, flouri&s;hing, and indu&s;trious. Grazing, e&s;pecially of black cattle, is the chief employment of the pea&s;ants all over Ireland, except in the province of Ul&s;ter, where the linen manufactory is the prin|cipal object. The great ob&s;tacle to the pro&s;perity and improvement of the kingdom is the extreme poverty and oppre&s;&s;ion of the common people. The produce of the kingdom, either in corn or cattle, is not above two thirds at mo&s;t of what by good cultivation it might yield. The high-roads, throughout the &s;outhern and we&s;tern parts, are lined with beggars, who live in huts or cabbins without chimnies, or any covering capable of de|fending the wretched inhabitants from the cold, wind, and rain. <Q>&startq;It is a &s;candal, &s;ays the &s;ame ju|dicious traveller, to the proprietors of this fertile country, that there is not the greate&s;t plenty of good corn and hay in it; but &s;ome of the be&s;t land in the king's dominions is &s;uffered to be torn in pieces, and cultivated in the vile&s;t manner, by a &s;et of abject mi&s;erable occupiers, who are ab&s;o|lutely no better than &s;laves to the de&s;picably lazy and oppre&s;&s;ive &s;ubordinate landlords.&endq;</Q> No country in the world abounds more with beautiful lakes, or loughs, as they are called there, e&s;pecially in the provinces of Ul&s;ter and Connaught. They are divided into fre&s;h water and &s;alt water lakes. Of the fre&s;h water lakes, the large&s;t are Lough-Neagh, lying between the counties of Armagh, Tyrone, Londonderry, Antrim, and Down; and Lough-Erne, which runs through the whole county of Fermanagh from the &s;outh-ea&s;t to the north-we&s;t: but the mo&s;t beautiful in the whole kingdom is the lake of Killarny, in the county of Kerry. Of the &s;alt lakes, arms, or in|lets
<PB N="416" REF="4240">
of the &s;ea, the principal are Strongford-lake, in the county of Down, Lough-Swilly, in that of Donnegal, and Lough-Foyle, in that of Derry. Though they have good coal-pits in &s;ome places, yet the principal fuel of the country is turf; but mo&s;t of the towns upon the coa&s;t are &s;upplied with coal from England or Scotland. The commodities that Ireland furni&s;hes for exportation are principally the&s;e, cattle, hides, tallow, butter, chee&s;e, honey, wax, wool, and woollen cloth, &s;almon, herrings, coar&s;e rugs, friezes, ratteens, camlets, timber, pipe-&s;taves, hemp, and linen cloth in great quantities, the &s;oil be|ing very proper for flax and hemp, of both which a great deal is rai&s;ed, e&s;pecially in the northern parts. The inhabitants have hitherto applied them&s;elves almo&s;t wholly to the breeding of cattle; but the parliament of Ireland hath of late di&s;tin|gui&s;hed it&s;elf by its attention to the true intere&s;ts of their country, and by the vigorous and patriotic mea&s;ures it hath taken to promote agriculture, trade, population, and police, and to bani&s;h ig|norance, popery, and &s;uper&s;tition. England reap great advantages from its commerce with Ireland, &s;upplying it with almo&s;t all &s;orts of goods, linen, woollen &s;tuffs, and provi&s;ions excepted. The Iri&s;h formerly exported woollen &s;tuffs to Spain and Holland; but the trade of England &s;uffering, as the former could &s;ell their goods much cheaper, this trade was prohibited by parliament: however, to make them amends, great encouragement is given to the linen manufacture, which they are al|lowed to import into England, together with raw wool, and, in time of &s;carcity, provi&s;ions. The roads in this kingdom are generally tolerably good for riding, running &s;ometimes ten or fifteen miles in a &s;trait line; but they are not equal to the Engli&s;h for a carriage. Turnpikes are e&s;tabli&s;hed
<PB N="41" REF="4250">
on all the principal roads, and the inns are tolerable; but few are provided with good hay or litter for hor&s;es. They have a variety of game, excellent hawks, and hor&s;es that are noted for their ea&s;y pacing. There are no wolves now, unle&s;s on the wild unfrequented mountains, where they have been heard to howl in hard winters. Bees abound in this i&s;land, and a great deal of honey is made by them not only in hives, but al&s;o in trunks of trees, and caverns of the earth. Vines are common enough, but the heat of the cli|mate is &s;eldom &s;ufficient to bring the grapes to maturity. The principal rivers of Ireland are the Shannon, Barrow, Neor, Suir, Bann, Lee, Liffy, and Boyne. The Shannon, which gives title of earl to a branch of the family of Boyle, is a very noble river, larger than any in England, but not navigable above fifty miles, on account of a ridge of rocks &s;outh of Killaloe running quite acro&s;s it, and &s;topping all navigation further up. It runs from north to &s;outh upwards of three hundred Engli&s;h miles, &s;preading it&s;elf into many large and beautiful lakes of different extent, from five to ten and fifteen miles, abounding with &s;almon, pike, &amp;c. of a very large &s;ize; and &s;ome of the lakes are adorned with fertile and beautiful i&s;lands. The Lee ri&s;es in the county of Cork, below which city it falls into the &s;ea, after an ea&s;terly cour&s;e for about twenty-&s;ix miles. The Liffy ri&s;es in the county of Wicklow, and falls into the Iri&s;h &s;ea below Dublin. The Boyne, remarkable for the victory gained on its banks by king William III. over king James II. and his adherents, ri&s;es in the King's county, and falls into the &s;ea at Drogheda. The Barrow, Neor, and Suir, have their &s;ources in different branches of one and the &s;ame mountain, namely Slieu-Bloom, and fall, after having united their &s;treams, into the &s;ea at Hook-point, at the mouth of the haven of
<PB N="418" REF="4260">
Waterford. The Bann, famous for a pearl fi&s;hery, but much more for that of &s;almon, ri&s;es in the county of Down, and falls into Lough-Neagh, in the county of Armagh. Here are a great num|ber of fair, &s;pacious, and commodious harbours, the chief of which are Waterford-haven, Carling|ford-haven, Strangford-haven, the bay of Car|rickfergus, on the ea&s;t; Lough-Foyle and Lough-Swilly, Ship-haven, Killybegs-harbour, Donne|gal-haven, on the north; Galway-haven, the mouth of the Shannon, Swerwick or St. Mary|wick-haven, Dingle-bay, on the we&s;t; Kimare-bay, or river, Bantry-bay, Dunmanus-bay, Bal|timore-bay, Ca&s;tle-haven, Glendore-haven, King|fale-haven, and Cork-haven, on the &s;outh and &s;outh-ea&s;t. The&s;e are the principal unbarred havens. There are al&s;o a great many barred havens, &s;ome of which have been much improved by acts of parliament, particularly that of Dublin. Tho' Ireland cannot be called a mountainous country, yet are there &s;everal lofty chains, as well as &s;ingle mountains in the kingdom. Three words in the Iri&s;h expre&s;s the different degrees of their elevation, namely, Knock, Slieve, and Bein. Among the la&s;t, or highe&s;t &s;ort, are the mountains of Car|lingford; the Curlieus, which &s;eparate the coun|ties of Sligoe, Ro&s;common, and Connaught; tho&s;e in the county of Donnegal, about Lough-Swilly; the Mangerton mountains in the county of Kerry; Croagh-Patrick, in the county of Mayo, from whence, as fabulous tradition relates, St. Patrick drove all &s;erpents and venomous creatures into the &s;ea; the Gualty mountains in the county of Tip|perary; Slieu-bloom, called by &s;ome writers the Blandine mountains, celebrated by the immortal Spencer in his Fairy Queen, running thro' part of the King and Queen's counties, and part of the county of Tipperary; the Brandon mountains in the

county of Kerry, to the ea&s;t of Smerwick-bay; Slieu|galen, in the county of Tyrone; the mountains of Wicklow, particularly the Sugar-loaf-hill; the mountains of Mourne and Iveagh, in the county of Down, reckoned among the highe&s;t in the king|dom, particularly that called Slein-Donard, which is &s;aid to be one thou&s;and and fifty-&s;ix yards in perpendicular heighth, and many others, &s;everal of which contain veins of iron, lead, copper, mi|nerals, coals, quarries of &s;tone, &s;late, and marble. The chief capes or head-lands are, Fair-head, or Fair-foreland, Cape-horn, and Telen-head on the north; Slime-head, or Sline-head, Loop-head, or Cape-lain, and Cape-Dor&s;es on the we&s;t; Mi&s;&s;en|head, Cape-Courcey, or the Old-head of King&s;ale on the &s;outh; Ardmore-head, Arklow-head, Wick|low-head, Bray-head, Hoath-head, and St. John's Foreland on the ea&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>TRADE.</HEAD>
<P>We have already mentioned the commodities of Ireland, by which, and its natural &s;ituation, ex|tended coa&s;ts, harbours, bays, and rivers, commo|dious for navigation, we may perceive how well it is formed and furni&s;hed for an exten&s;ive traffic: but the Engli&s;h, from a principle of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, and to prevent the ruin of their own commerce, have thought proper to re&s;train and di&s;courage that of Ireland in &s;ome articles, particularly with regard to wool and woollen goods; for wool and bay-yarn are allowed to be exported only to England: yet from a thir&s;t of gain, all hazards are run to &s;end them by &s;tealth into other countries, to the great detriment of the Engli&s;h woollen ma|nufactures. The chief manufacture of Ireland, and the principal branch of its commerce, con|&s;i&s;ts in linnen cloth, yarn, lawns, and cambricks,
<PB N="420" REF="4280">
which are the principal &s;ources of whatever wealth there is in that country. Be&s;ides, they export con|&s;iderable quantities of butter, tallow, leather, bar|relled beef and pork, and herrings. Ship-build|ing is no incon&s;iderable branch of bu&s;ine&s;s, and employs a great many hands. In good years they export a great deal of corn to Portugal; but when their crops fail, they have recour&s;e to England for &s;upplies. Be&s;ides the wool and yarn brought to England, and clande&s;tinely exported, together with woollen manufactures, their home con&s;ump|tion is &s;o entirely &s;upplied thereby, that not a &s;ingle article of that kind is wanted from abroad. The chief articles of their importation are wine, brandy, tobacco, &s;pices, hops, coals, copper, block tin, lead, We&s;t-India commodities, mercery, grocery, and haberda&s;hery goods, and of the&s;e the greater part comes from England. But all their cloaths, equipages, furniture, and many of their &s;ilks, are made at home. By a late compu|tation, the prote&s;tants are not above one-&s;ixth part of the inhabitants. The papi&s;ts are mo&s;tly employed in country-work, as tilling the land; and rai&s;ing cattle; and the prote&s;tants, Engli&s;h, and Scots, are generally embarked in trade and manufactures. The pre&s;ent revenue of Ireland is e&s;timated at about half a million. The country &s;uffers greatly by remittances to the ab&s;entees, both in England and abroad; for there are &s;everal regiments of Iri&s;h in the &s;ervice of France and Spain, be&s;ides many officers of their nation in the armies of different powers of Europe: a way of life to which they are inclined, partly by their martial di&s;po&s;ition, and partly by the di&s;courage|ments to which their religion &s;ubjects them in Ireland.</P>

<HEAD>RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>Chri&s;tianity &s;eems to have been fir&s;t planted here by Palladius in the fifth century, but more fully by his &s;ucce&s;&s;or St. Patrick, who is &s;aid to have been born in Clyde&s;dale in Scotland. The i&s;land is commonly called by the antient hi&s;to|rians In&s;ula Sanctorum, as having produced more &s;aints, martyrs, and confe&s;&s;ors, than any other nation in the world. St. Patrick appears to have come hither about the year 432, to have retired in 465, and to have died in 492. The e&s;tabli&s;hed religion at pre&s;ent is the &s;ame as in England, both in doctrine and di&s;cipline; and the government of the church is under four archbi&s;hops, viz. of Armagh, who is primate of all Ireland, of Dublin, who is &s;tiled primate of Ireland, of Ca&s;hell, and Tuam. The&s;e archbi&s;hops have under them twenty &s;uffra|gan bi&s;hops, who&s;e &s;ees are generally well endowed, viz. the fir&s;t eight, the &s;econd three, the third five, and the la&s;t four. Ireland has only one uni|ver&s;ity, namely, that of Dublin, which is wholly devoted to the church of England; but the num|ber of &s;tudents fall far &s;hort of either of the two Engli&s;h univer&s;ities.</P>

<HEAD>CIVIL GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>

The king &s;ends a viceroy, who, at different periods, hath been &s;tiled cu&s;tos, or keeper, ju&s;ticiary, warden, procurator, &s;ene&s;chal, con&s;table, ju&s;tice, ju&s;tice's|deputy, and lieutenant, and who comes as near the grandeur and maje&s;ty of a king, both in au|thority and &s;tate, as any viceroy in Chri&s;tendom. To a&s;&s;i&s;t him on all occa&s;ions, he has a privy coun|cil,
<PB N="422" REF="4300">
compo&s;ed of the officers of &s;tate, and &s;uch others as his maje&s;ty is plea&s;ed to appoint. The parliament is called, prorogued, and di&s;&s;olved, at the plea&s;ure of the &s;overeign. During former reigns, the &s;ame parliament continued till the death of the king: but by a late act, a new parliament is to be cho&s;en every eight years. The &s;everal orders and degrees of the people and nobility, are much the &s;ame here as in England; as are al&s;o the courts of ju&s;tice, their terms, and man|ner of proceeding, a&s;&s;izes, ju&s;tices of the peace, &amp;c. The i&s;land is divided into four provinces, namely, Mun&s;ter, Lein&s;ter, Connaught, and Ul&s;ter; and the&s;e again into five circuits, containing thirty-two counties, of which Tipperary is a palatinate, and that of Dublin is not comprehended in any of the five circuits.

They had the eleventh part of all the fines in criminal ca&s;es, which brought them in a good income; the greate&s;t crimes, as murder, rapes, and rob|beries, being then only puni&s;hed in that manner. The Iri&s;h laws and cu&s;toms prevailed over a great part of the kingdom, till the whole was reduced by queen Elizabeth, and modelled according to the Engli&s;h con&s;titution by king James I. The common law of England, together with their own &s;tatutes and acts of parliament, is now the rule both in the courts at Dublin, and all tho&s;e &s;ubordinate to them.</P>

<P>Be&s;ides the univer&s;ity of Dublin, of which we &s;hall give an account when we de&s;cribe that city, and a great number of free-&s;chools erected in different parts of the kingdom, both by public and private munificence, there are many Eng|li&s;h prote&s;tant working-&s;chools, erected by a &s;o|ciety incorporated by a charter pa&s;&s;ed for that pur|po&s;e, than which a more effectual method could not have been contrived for the in&s;truction of the poor popi&s;h natives of Ireland in the principles of real chri&s;tianity, and for inuring them to indu&s;try, labour, and obedience to their &s;overeign. Of the&s;e &s;chools there are now a great number filled
<PB N="424" REF="4320">
with children, who are not only maintained with all nece&s;&s;aries, brought up to labour and indu&s;try, and in&s;tructed in the duties of true religion, but, when qualified, are put out apprentices to prote&s;tant ma&s;ters: after their apprentice&s;hips are expired, a portion of five pounds is given to him or her who marries a prote&s;tant with the appro|bation of the committee of fifteen. There is al&s;o in Dublin a charter-nur&s;ery, where children &s;ent up from the country in rags are cloathed, fed, taught, and attended by a ma&s;ter, mi&s;tre&s;s, and nur&s;e, from whence they are tran&s;planted to coun|try-&s;chools as occa&s;ion offers. The free-&s;chools in Ireland amounted in the year 1748, to one hundred and &s;ixty-eight, in which were educated three thou|&s;and and &s;ix children, exclu&s;ive of thirty prote&s;tant working-&s;chools, in which eight hundred and eighty-five children were fed, cloathed, and taught gratis.</P>

<HEAD>Of the IRISH BARDS or POETS.</HEAD>
<P>Antiently the bards were very numerous in Ireland. Their bu&s;ine&s;s was chiefly to tran&s;mit to po&s;terity the heroic and memorable actions of fa|mous men. The romantic tales contained in their ballads, p&s;alters, chronicles, and traditions, concerning their antient heroes, would fill a great number of volumes. The number of the&s;e bards, which amounted at one time to near a third part of the nation, with their de&s;tructive privileges and great idlene&s;s, rendering them at la&s;t a public nui|&s;ance, a convention was held at Dromceat, expre&s;s|ly for removing it: when a reform was actually effected, and by degrees, as the country became more enlightened and indu&s;trious, a change of manners and cu&s;toms took place; and the bards, as an in&s;titution or order of men in the &s;tate, in the end entirely di&s;appeared.</P>

<HEAD>CHARACTER of the INHABITANTS.</HEAD>
<P>The Iri&s;h of the pre&s;ent generation are a medley of the de&s;cendants of the antient, or, as they have been u&s;ually called, wild Iri&s;h, and of the Engli&s;h emigrants. As to the de&s;cendants of the antient Iri&s;h, who&s;e names generally begin with Mae or O, tho&s;e on the ea&s;t and we&s;t coa&s;ts &s;eem to be of a different origin. The inhabitants of the ea&s;t and north coa&s;ts, who probably came origi|nally from Britain, and into Britain from Gaul, are of a &s;quat &s;et &s;tature, with &s;hort broad faces, thick lips, hollow eyes, and no&s;es turned up; whereas tho&s;e on the we&s;tern coa&s;t &s;eem, to be de|&s;cended from a colony of Spaniards, whom they re&s;emble in their per&s;ons, being tall and &s;lender, finely limbed, with grave and &s;edate countenances, long eye-brows, and lank dark hair. But though the&s;e di&s;tinctions are now in a great mea&s;ure worn out by intermarriages with one another and the Engli&s;h, &s;ince the conque&s;t of Ireland by Henry II. yet they are &s;till di&s;cernible. The language of the antient Iri&s;h &s;eems to be a mixture of the old Briti&s;h and the Cantabrian or Spani&s;h; but it is now in a manner lo&s;t, or under&s;tood by few, except of the poorer &s;ort. With re&s;pect to their character, the native Iri&s;h &s;eem to have degenerated from their ance&s;tors in valour and learning, being ignorant, &s;uper&s;titious, and credulous, in con&s;e|quence of their blind &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their popi&s;h prie&s;ts. Impatient of abu&s;e and injury, they are implacable and violent in all their affections; but quick of apprehen&s;ion, con&s;tant in love, courteous to &s;trangers, and patient of hard&s;hips. In the &s;ervice of foreign princes they are di&s;tingui&s;hed by their courage and fidelity; though not remarkable
<PB N="426" REF="4340">
for their bravery at home. The mu&s;ic they admire mo&s;t is that of the harp and bagpipe. The &s;urnames, e&s;pecially of the better &s;ort, have generally an O or Mac, which &s;ignifies &s;on, placed before them. The Iri&s;h, at pre&s;ent, are &s;aid to be much given to drinking; and, in general, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a no|tion that they cannot lay any claim to the character of being polite, unle&s;s they lay it down as a maxim in entertaining &s;trangers never to &s;uffer them to depart from their hou&s;e &s;ober: but we mu&s;t do them the ju&s;tice to own, that this notion is com|mon to them with &s;ome other European nations, who value them&s;elves much upon their politene&s;s. Thus does a fal&s;e ta&s;te, joined to a ridiculous va|nity and o&s;tentation, u&s;urp the &s;acred name of friend&s;hip and ho&s;pitality: indeed, among the more &s;en&s;ible part of the natives of Ireland, &s;uch no|tions and practices are ju&s;tly de&s;pi&s;ed and ex|ploded. The inhabitants are very far from be|ing what they have been too often repre&s;ented by tho&s;e who had never an opportunity of know|ing their real character, but were blinded with prejudice. Whoever vi&s;its Ireland will find as great a proportion of genius, civility, and under|&s;tanding, even in the very lowe&s;t cla&s;s of the na|tives, as in mo&s;t other countries. A late traveller repre&s;ents their common people, tho&s;e e&s;pecially of the Roman catholic per&s;ua&s;ion, as labouring under the greate&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion, poverty, and &s;la|very, being fleeced, or rather flead, by their hard-hearted prie&s;ts and landlords. He &s;ays, if there are any wild Iri&s;h remaining, it is in the province of Connaught, the common people there having the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e of law and government of any in Ire|land, except their tyrannic landlords, who, in a literal &s;en&s;e, are ab&s;olute &s;overeigns over their re|&s;pective towns and clans. Engli&s;h is the uiver&s;al
<PB N="427" REF="4350">
language of Ireland among people of any fortune, and very few of the lowe&s;t cla&s;s are to be met with who cannot &s;peak it: many of them &s;peak both Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h equally well. At the inns, tho' they are far from making the appearance of tho&s;e in England, yet the traveller will generally meet with civil u&s;age, with good provi&s;ions, and for him&s;elf clean decent lodging; but, for want of good hay and litter, the ca&s;e will be far otherwi&s;e with his hor&s;e. "The people of Ireland, &s;ays the gentleman we hinted at above, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of any fortune, are genteel, &s;prightly, &s;en|&s;ible, &s;ociable, and generally well affected to the Engli&s;h, from whom their dre&s;s, fa&s;hions, and diver&s;ions are taken. The Engli&s;hman that can drink will find them as ho&s;pitable as any people in Europe; if he can drink like an Iri&s;hman, he will be heartily welcome to eat like an Engli&s;h|man." But though he cannot help inveighing again&s;t their fal&s;e notions of ho&s;pitality, he allows that there is a native &s;prightline&s;s and &s;ociability, a genero&s;ity and frankne&s;s in their general man|ner, that is con&s;picuous and engaging, and which cannot fail of recommending them to &s;trangers.</P>

<HEAD>CURIOSITIES.</HEAD>
<P>An exemption from &s;erpents and other veno|mous creatures, a favour granted by providence to few other parts of the habitable globe, if we ex|cept the i&s;lands of Crete and Yvica, hath been al|ready mentioned. Ireland indeed has &s;piders and newts, but not poi&s;onous. The vulgar Iri&s;h, and many of the learned, are &s;o weak as to a&s;cribe this exemption to a miracle wrought by St. Patrick, notwith&s;tanding Solinus, who lived &s;ome centu|ries before him, mentions this property as a circum&s;tance well known in his time. Another
<PB N="428" REF="4360">
curio&s;ity, as they may well be reckoned, tho' the breed is now almo&s;t extinct, are the Iri&s;h wolf dogs. They are large and &s;trong, and of a fine &s;hape. Pre&s;ents of them have been often made to princes and other great men, and highly valued. The go&s;hawks and ger-falcons may be al&s;o mentioned under this head, as they are e&s;teemed the be&s;t in the world. The ger-falcons, the large&s;t bird of the falcon kind, approaching the &s;ize of a vulture, and of the greate&s;t &s;trength next the eagle, as they are but rarely to be met with, &s;o they excel all other hawks in beauty. Formerly there was a large fowl, called the cock of the wood, in Ire|land. It equalled a peacock in &s;ize; but the &s;pe|cies, both of them and the moo&s;e-deer, who&s;e horns have been often di&s;covered under ground in bogs, are now extinct. Other curio&s;ities in Ireland are the many beautiful lakes and inlets of the &s;ea, abounding in fi&s;h and inter&s;per&s;ed with i&s;lands, embelli&s;hed with a variety of &s;hrubs and trees; the glyns or deep narrow vallies among the mountains, who&s;e &s;ides are adorned with woods, and the bottoms watered with chry&s;tal &s;treams; the many wonderful cataracts, falls, or &s;almon|leaps, as they are called, from the &s;almon, which in the &s;ea&s;on of the year for &s;pawning, are conti|nually leaping over them; that &s;urprizing phe|nomenon, in the county of Antrim, called the Giants-cau&s;eway; and, la&s;tly, the bogs, which &s;upply the country with very good fuel, and are &s;ome of them of great extent. This fuel &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t of rotten wood, or the roots of the heath, converted into a kind of black combu&s;tible &s;pongy mud or &s;ub&s;tance, which when dug, or cut out of the bog, in oblong pieces and dried, make very good firing. Thus much in general of the natural curio&s;ities of Ireland, for which, perhaps, no country in the world is more
<PB N="429" REF="4370">
remarkable. Of antiquities and artificial curio&s;i|ties, the number is not great. The mo&s;t worthy of note are the tall &s;lender towers built of lime and &s;tone, and di&s;per&s;ed thro' various parts of the kingdom. Some of the mo&s;t remarkable curio&s;i|ties we &s;hall treat of at large in the counties where they are found. We now proceed to a more particular de&s;cription of the &s;everal provinces of Ireland, and the counties contained in each, be|ginning with Ul&s;ter, in the north.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The PROVINCE of ULSTER.</HEAD>
<P>This province, which is called in Latin Ulto|nia, in Iri&s;h Cui Guilly, and gives title of earl to the dukes of York of the royal family, has the Atlantic ocean on the we&s;t; St. George's channel and the Iri&s;h &s;ea on the ea&s;t; the Deucalidonean ocean on the north; and on the &s;outh and &s;outh-we&s;t, the provinces of Lein&s;ter and Connaught. Its greate&s;t length is near one hundred and twenty miles, its breadth about one hundred, and its circumference, including the windings and turn|ings, four hundred and &s;ixty, containing nine counties, fifty-eight market-towns and boroughs, one archbi&s;hopric, &s;ix bi&s;hoprics, and two hun|dred and fourteen pari&s;hes. Ul&s;ter abounds in lakes and rivers, which &s;upply it with variety of fine fi&s;h, e&s;pecially &s;almon, be&s;ides what it has from the &s;ea, with which a great part of it is bounded. The &s;outhern parts of it are rich, fer|tile, well cultivated, and enclo&s;ed; but the greater part of the northern is open and mountainous. The towns of this province are, in general, the neate&s;t and be&s;t built of any in Ireland, as well as the farm-hou&s;es, which, in mo&s;t parts of the kingdom, are con&s;tructed of no better materials than clay and &s;traw. The inhabitants of Ul&s;ter are al&s;o more like the Engli&s;h in their manner and
<PB N="430" REF="4380">
dialect, than tho&s;e of the other three provinces: for as it includes within it&s;elf the whole, or by far the greater part of the linen manufactory, the be&s;t branch of trade in the kingdom, they have con&s;e|quently the greate&s;t intercour&s;e with England. An Engli&s;hman in &s;ome parts of it, indeed, will imagine him&s;elf, from the &s;imilarity of their lan|guage and manners, in his own country. The Scots that came and &s;ettled in Britain under Fergus are &s;aid to have been tran&s;planted from hence. This province had antiently petty kings of its own. It was fir&s;t &s;ubjected to the Engli&s;h in the reign of Hen|ry II. by John Courcy, the fir&s;t who bore the title of earl of Ul&s;ter; but it afterwards threw off the yoke, and was never entirely reduced till the reign of James I. when great numbers of Scots, by his encouragement, went and &s;ettled in it. Of the&s;e, mo&s;t of the pre&s;ent inhabitants are the de&s;cendants. This province was the fir&s;t and principal &s;cene of the bloody ma&s;&s;acre in 1641. The counties con|tained in it are, Donnegal, Londonderry, Antrim, Tyrone, Fermanagh, Cavan, Monaghan, Ar|magh, and Down.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The county of DONNEGAL, or TYRCONNEL.</HEAD>
<P>This county has the &s;ea on the north and we&s;t, the bay of Donnegal and the county of Ferma|nagh on the &s;outh, the counties of Londonderry, Tyrone, and part of Fermanagh on the ea&s;t. Its greate&s;t length from &s;outh-ea&s;t to north-we&s;t is &s;ixty-four miles, and its breadth thirty-five, be|ing well peopled and cultivated. The air is good, and the &s;oil, in general, fertile, the boggy grounds having of late been much drained and improved by &s;hells brought from the &s;ea-&s;hore, and &s;pread upon them as manure. It contains five baronies, and about &s;ix hundred and thirty thou&s;and acres, abounds with harbours, and now gives title of
<PB N="431" REF="4390">
earl to a family of Engli&s;h extraction, of the name of Carpenter, but antiently to the O Don|nels and Talbots. It &s;ends to parliament two members for the &s;hire, and two for each of the following boroughs, viz. St. John&s;town, Don|negal, Bally&s;hannon, Killibegs, and Lifford.</P>
<P>Donnegal, which gives name to the county, and the title of earl to a family of the name of Chi|che&s;ter, &s;tands on a great bay, full of good har|bours, yet has not much trade. It is true, there are &s;uch &s;helves in the mouth of the bay, that it requires an expert pilot.</P>
<P>St. John&s;town is a &s;mall town on the river Foyle, to the north-we&s;t of Derry.</P>
<P>Bally&s;hannon &s;tands on the river that i&s;&s;ues from Lough-Erne, not far from its mouth. It has a harbour and &s;ome trade, and is pretty well inha|bited. At a fall near it is a &s;almon-fi&s;hery, the property of lord Donnegal, which lets for &s;ixteen hundred pounds per annum.</P>
<P>Lifford, which &s;tands on the river Foyle, tho' a &s;mall place, is the &s;hire-town, and gives the title of baron to earl Fitzwilliams.</P>
<P>Killybegs &s;tands on a fine bay, and has a good harbour, but little trade.</P>
<P>Raphoe, though a poor place, is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, and has a free-&s;chool, with a &s;tately ca&s;tle for the re&s;idence of the bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>Laterkenny, Rathmetton, Buncranagh, and Rathmullen, are all &s;mall places. The la&s;t has a &s;mall harbour on the &s;ea-coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;alt-water lake, or rather arm of the &s;ea, called Lough-Swilly, runs eighteen miles up into this county, and is about five miles broad at its mouth. A thou&s;and &s;ail might ride in it with &s;afety. There are many villages and gentlemen's &s;eats on its banks, but no town or trade of any con&s;equence. In &s;hort, all the north-we&s;t part of
<PB N="432" REF="4400">
Ireland is full of lakes, bays, and harbours, but, for want of trade, very little known or frequented. Two of the mo&s;t remarkable fre&s;h-water lakes in this county are Lough-Derg and Lough-Fin, the former of which contains an i&s;land, in which was antiently a cell or cave much frequented by the Ro|man Catholics, both natives and foreigners, who came hither in pilgrimage, and to do penance. Here the friars made their deluded votaries believe, that, for the conviction of unbelievers, St. Pa|trick had, by his prayers, obtained of God that purgatory &s;hould be vi&s;ible. But to prevent their di&s;covering the cheat, they made them watch and fa&s;t &s;o rigorou&s;ly, by way of preparation, before they were &s;uffered to enter it, and told them &s;uch horrid &s;tories, that their brains were in a manner turn|ed; in con&s;equence of which they actually fancied they &s;aw the pains of purgatory. In king James I's time, &s;ome gentlemen, being &s;ent to inquire into this matter, found that it was a little vault hewed out of a rock, capable of containing &s;ix or eight per&s;ons, and quite dark when the door was &s;hut. Upon the report made by the&s;e gentlemen, the friars were ordered to quit the i&s;land, their hou&s;es were demoli&s;hed, and the cell laid open, as it has remained ever &s;ince.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>LONDONDERRY, or COLERAIN.</HEAD>
<P>This county is bounded on the &s;outh and &s;outh-we&s;t by the county of Tyrone; by Antrim on the ea&s;t, from which it is parted by the river Bann; by Donnegal on the we&s;t; and that county and the Deucalidonean ocean on the north. Its greate&s;t length is about thirty-&s;ix miles, its breadth thirty, containing about two hundred and fifty-one thou&s;and five hundred and ten acres. The bogs and heaths of this county are manured with &s;ea|&s;hells,
<PB N="433" REF="4410">
as tho&s;e of Donnegal. Like that too it is pretty champain, and not unfruitful. It is par|ticularly noted for a very clear river, called the Bann, abounding with &s;almon, a fi&s;h &s;aid to delight in limpid &s;treams. This river, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from a le&s;&s;er of the &s;ame name, is called the Greater or Lower Bann. In order to cultivate, &s;ettle, and civilize this county, king James I. granted it, by letters patent to a &s;ociety, by the name of the governor and a&s;&s;i&s;tants at London of the new plan|tation of Ul&s;ter in the realm of Ireland. It con|tains &s;ix baronies, and, be&s;ides the two knights of the &s;hire, &s;ends to parliament two members for the city of Londonderry, and two each for Cole|rain, and Newton-Limavady, or Lamnevady.</P>
<P>Londonderry, or Derry, the capital of the county, and the fee of a bi&s;hop, &s;tands at the bottom of Lough-Foyle. This city has a very good port, to which &s;hips of the greate&s;t burden have acce&s;s, and a con&s;iderable trade. It will be ever famous for the gallantry and per&s;everance with which it defended it&s;elf in three memorable &s;ieges, in defiance of the greate&s;t hard&s;hips and di&s;couragements, namely, 1&s;t, In 1641, when the rebels could not reduce it either by fraud or force. 2dly, In 1649, when it was be&s;ieged by the lord Ardes, and reduced almo&s;t to extremity by famine, till at la&s;t relieved by troops &s;ent from Eng|land. 3dly, When it held out again&s;t the French and Iri&s;h from the 7th of December, 1688, to the la&s;t day of July, 1689, though it was neither well fortified, nor provided with a garri&s;on or &s;tores of provi&s;ion and ammunition, and hardly any at|tempt made to relieve it during &s;o long a time: Tho' the city is twenty miles up the river, yet very large &s;hips can come up to the key, where there is four or five fathoms of water. It is now well fortified with a &s;trong wall, be&s;ides outworks;
<PB N="434" REF="4420">
and along the banks of the river are &s;everal ca&s;tles and a fort. This city is of no great antiquity, having been built and planted in the reign of James I. by a colony &s;ent by the &s;ociety abovementioned. The trade of the town is very con&s;iderable, having not only a large &s;hare in the herring-fi&s;hery, but &s;ending &s;hips al&s;o to the We&s;t-Indies, New-Eng|land, and Newfoundland, for which they are &s;o ad|vantageou&s;ly &s;ituated, that a ve&s;&s;el bound from thence to America often arrive there before a Lon|don &s;hip can get clear of the &s;oundings, or arrive in the latitude of Londonderry. Tho' there are a great many &s;hallows in Lough Foyle, which &s;erves it in&s;tead of a road, yet they are ea&s;ily avoided, as there are deep channels between them. Tho&s;e points called Emi&s;tone, Ru&s;terhull, or Caldy-head, which lie a little to the we&s;t of the mouth of the harbour, are counted the mo&s;t northerly of Ireland, lying in lat. 55&deg; 20&prime;. The inhabitants of this city are a mo&s;t all prote&s;tants. <Q>It gives title of earl and baron to a branch of the family of Pitt. A late traveller &s;ays, &startq;Derry is, perhaps, the cleane&s;t, be&s;t built, and mo&s;t beautifully &s;ituated town in Ireland; and excepting Cork as conve|nient as any for commerce, foreign and dome&s;tic, and, but for the re&s;trictions on the trade of Ire|land, would in a few years become a flouri&s;hing and wealthy city.&endq;</Q> The lake almo&s;t &s;urrounds it, and the whole ground-plot both of it and its liber|ties belongs to the twelve great companies of London. Great quantities of &s;almon, &s;alted and barrelled, are exported from hence to America.</P>
<P>Colerain is a hand&s;ome walled town, &s;tanding near the mouth of the Great Bann. It would pro|bably be a place of good trade, if the river, by being confined within a narrow channel, was not &s;o extremely rapid, that it is difficult for ve&s;&s;els, even with the help of the tide, to &s;tem the current;
<PB N="435" REF="4430">
be&s;ides, &s;hips of burden cannot get in at all. Here, however, is a very valuable &s;almon fi&s;hery; one in particular belonging to the city of London, which lets for fifteen hundred pounds a-year. Be|fore the building of Londonderry, the county took its name from this town, which gives title of bar&ocirc;n to a family of the &s;urname of Hanger.</P>
<P>Newton-Limavaddy is a thriving market-town on a river called Ree-water, near Lough-Foyle.</P>
<P>Magherafelt, and Ballinderry, are &s;mall incon|&s;iderable places.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ANTRIM.</HEAD>
<P>This is the mo&s;t northern county of Ireland, and is bounded by that of Down on the &s;outh-ea&s;t, that of Londonderry on the we&s;t, from which it is &s;eparated by the river Bann, part of Armagh on the &s;outh, St. George's channel on the ea&s;t, and the Deucalidonian - ocean on the north. Its greate&s;t length is about forty-&s;ix miles, its greate&s;t breadth about twenty-&s;even, and the number of acres it contains, plantation mea&s;ure, are computed at three hundred and eighty-three thou|&s;and. Tho' the county is much incumbered with bogs and mar&s;hes, yet it enjoys a pretty good air, and is well peopled, chiefly with prote&s;tants. Where it is free from bogs the &s;oil is fruitful. It &s;ends two members for the &s;hire, and two for each of the following towns, viz. Li&s;burn, Belfa&s;t, Antrim, and Randal&s;town.</P>
<P>Belfa&s;t is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable town in all this part of Ireland for extent, wealth, trade, and number of inhabitants. The harbour below the town is commodious, and has a good depth of water. A great trade is carried on from hence to Scotland, particularly to Gla&s;gow; and mo&s;t of the inhabitants, both of the town and the neigh|bouring
<PB N="436" REF="4440">
country, are of Scotch extraction, and of the pre&s;byterian religion. Three miles from hence is a very beautiful &s;eat belonging to&mdash;Hill, e&s;quire.</P>
<P>Li&s;burn is a &s;mall town, &s;eated on a river called Lagen-water, which falls into Carrickfergus-bay. It gives the title of vi&s;count to the right honoura|ble Wilmot Vaughan, one of the lords of trade and plantation.</P>
<P>Antrim, which gives name to the county, and the title of earl to the antient family of M'Donnel, is a con&s;iderable town, plea&s;antly &s;ituated on a branch of Lough-Neagh, called the Six-mile-water, on which it has a harbour for boats.</P>
<P>Randal&s;town, tho' a parliamentary borough, is a place of little note.</P>
<P>Carrickfergus, or Knockfergus, that is the Rock of Fergus, &s;o called from Fergus I. king of Scotland, who, after quelling a rebellion here, was ca&s;t away in the bay in his return to Scotland, is a populous town, walled and fortified, with an excellent harbour, and defended by a ca&s;tle on a high rock. In the road before the town there is depth enough of water for large &s;hips; but &s;mall ve&s;&s;els only can come up to the pier. Here the a&s;&s;izes and quarter-&s;e&s;&s;ions are kept both for the county at large, and for the town and its liber|ties, which are a di&s;tinct county; and there is a gaol here for both. Tho' it has not the privilege of &s;ending members to parliament, yet it is a cor|poration, and has a good market.</P>

<P>Bu&s;h &s;tands on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, and near it is that re|markable natural curio&s;ity, called the Giant's cau&s;e|way, which is perhaps unexceptionably one of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ingular natural curio&s;ities in the known world; for it is, indeed, the only exhibition of the kind that was yet ever met with in the creation. The principal, or grand cau&s;eway, for there are &s;everal le&s;s con&s;iderable and &s;cattered fragments of &s;imilar workman&s;hip, con&s;i&s;ts of a mo&s;t irregular arrangement of many hundred thou|&s;ands of columns of a black kind of rock, hard as marble: almo&s;t all of them are of a pentagonal figure, but &s;o clo&s;ely and compactly &s;ituated on their &s;ides, though perfectly di&s;tinct from top to bottom, that &s;carce any thing can be introduced between them. The columns are of an unequal height and breadth, &s;ome of the highe&s;t, vi&s;ible
<PB N="438" REF="4460">
above the &s;urface of the &s;trand, and at the foot of the impending angular precipice, may be about twenty feet; they do not exceed this height, at lea&s;t none of the principal arrangement. How deep they are fixed in the &s;trand was never yet di&s;covered. This grand arrange|ment extends nearly two hundred yards, vi|&s;ible at low water, how far beyond is uncer|tain; from its declining appearance, however, at low water, it is probable, it does not extend under water to a di&s;tance any thing equal to what is &s;een above. The breadth of the principal cau&s;eway, which runs out in one continued range of columns is, in general, from twenty to thirty feet, at one place or two it may be nearly forty for a few yards. In this account are excluded the broken and &s;cattered pieces of the &s;ame kind of con&s;truction, that are detached from the &s;ides of the grand cau&s;eway, as they do not appear to to have ever been contiguous to the principal arrangement, though they have frequently been taken into the width; which has been the cau&s;e of &s;uch wild and di&s;&s;imilar repre&s;entations of this cau&s;eway, which different accounts have exhi|bited. The highe&s;t part of this cau&s;eway is the nar|rowe&s;t at the very foot of the impending cliff, from whence the whole projects, where for four or five yards, it is not above ten or fifteen feet wide. The columns of this narrow part incline from a perpendicular a little to the we&s;tward, and form a &s;lope on their tops, by the very unequal height of the columns on the two &s;ides, by which an a&s;cent is made at the foot of the cliff, from the head of one column to the next above, gradatim, to the top of the great cau&s;eway, which, at the di&s;tance of half a dozen yards from the cliff, ob|tains a perpendicular po&s;ition, and lowering in its general height, widens to about twenty or between
<PB N="439" REF="4470">
twenty and thirty feet, and for one hundred yards nearly is always above water. The tops of the co|lumns for this length being nearly of an equal height, they form a grand and &s;ingular parade, that may be ea&s;ily walked on, rather inclining to the water's edge. But from high water-mark, as it is perpetually wa&s;hed by the beating &s;urges on every return of the tide, the platform lowers con|&s;iderably, and becomes more and more uneven, &s;o as not to be walked on but with the greate&s;t care. At the di&s;tance of one hundred and fifty yards from the cliff, it turns a little to the ea&s;t for twenty or thirty yards, and then &s;inks into the &s;ea. Thus far we have traced the general figure and outlines only of this mo&s;t &s;ingular phaenome|non; we will now point out the circum&s;tances that are particularly curious and extraordinary in this cau&s;eway, which are, the figure of the columns, their con&s;truction, and clo&s;e combination with each other; together with the general di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;everal phaenomena of this kind about the place. The figure of the&s;e columns is almo&s;t un|exceptionably pentagonal, or compo&s;ed of five &s;ides, there are but very few of any other figure introduced; &s;ome few there are of three, four, and &s;ix &s;ides, but the generality of them are five &s;ided, and the &s;pectator mu&s;t look very nicely to find any of a different con&s;truction: yet what is very extraordinary, and particularly curious, there are not two columns in ten thou&s;and to be found, that either have their &s;ides equal among them&s;elves, or who&s;e figures are alike. Nor is the compo&s;ition of the&s;e columns or pillars le&s;s de&s;erving the atten|tion of the curious &s;pectator. They are not of one &s;olid &s;tone in an upright po&s;ition, but com|po&s;ed of &s;everal &s;hort lengths, curiou&s;ly joined, not with flat &s;urfaces, but articulated into each other, like ball and &s;ocket, or like the joints in the
<PB N="440" REF="4480">
vertebrae of &s;ome of the larger kind of fi&s;h, the one end at the joint having a cavity, into which the convex end of the oppo&s;ite is exactly fitted. This is not vi&s;ible, but by disjoining the two &s;tones. The depth of the concavity or convexi|ty is generally about three or four inches. And what is &s;till farther remarkable of the joint, the convexity, and the corre&s;pondent concavity, is not conformed to the external angular figure of the column, but exactly round, and as large as the &s;ize or diameter of the column will admit; and, con&s;equently, as the angles of the&s;e columns are, in general, extremely unequal, the circular edges of the joint is &s;eldom coincident with more than two or three &s;ides of the pentagonal, and from the edge of the circular part of the joint to the exterior &s;ides and angles they are quite plain. It is &s;till farther very remarkable, likewi&s;e, that the articulations of the&s;e joints are frequently inverted; in &s;ome the concavity is upwards, in others the rever&s;e. This occa&s;ions that variety and mixture of concavities and convexities on the tops of the columns, which is ob&s;ervable throughout the platform of this cau&s;eway, yet without any di&s;co|verable de&s;ign or regularity with re&s;pect to the number of either. The length, al&s;o, of the&s;e par|ticular &s;tones, from joint to joint, is various; in general, they are from eighteen to twenty-four inches long, and, for the mo&s;t part, longer toward the bottom of the columns than nearer the top, and the articulation of the joints &s;omething deeper. The &s;ize, or diameter, likewi&s;e, of the columns is as different as their length and figure; in general, they are from fifteen to twenty inches in diameter. There are really no traces of uniformity or de&s;ign di&s;covered throughout the whole combination, except in the form of the joint, which is invariably by an articulation of the convex into the concave
<PB N="441" REF="4490">
of the piece next above or below it; nor are there any traces of a fini&s;hing in any part, either in height, length, or breadth of this curious cau&s;e|way. If there is here and there a &s;mooth top to any of the columns above water, there are others ju&s;t by, of equal height, that are more or le&s;s convex or concave, which &s;hew them to have been joined to pieces that have been wa&s;hed, or by other means taken off. And undoubtedly tho&s;e parts that are always above water have, from time to time, been made as even as might be; and the remaining &s;urfaces of the joints mu&s;t na|turally have been worn &s;moother by the con&s;tant friction of weather and walking, than where the &s;ea, at every tide, is beating upon it and conti|nually removing &s;ome of the upper &s;tones and ex|po&s;ing fre&s;h joints. And, farther, as the&s;e co|lumns pre&s;erve their diameters, from top to bottom, in all the exterior ones, which have two or three &s;ides expo&s;ed to view, the &s;ame may, with rea&s;on, be inferred of the interior columns, who&s;e tops only are vi&s;ible. Yet what is very extraordinary, and equally curious in this phaenomenon is, that notwith&s;tanding the univer&s;al di&s;&s;imilitude of the columns, both as to their figure and diameter, and though perfectly di&s;tinct from top to bottom, yet is the whole arrangement &s;o clo&s;ely combined at all points, that hardly a knife can be introduced between them either on the &s;ides or angles. And it is really a mo&s;t curious piece of entertainment to examine the clo&s;e contexture and nice in&s;ertion of &s;uch an infinite variety of angular figures as are exhibited on the &s;urface of this grand parade. From the infinite di&s;&s;imilarity of the figure of the&s;e columns, this will appear a mo&s;t &s;urprizing cir|cum&s;tance to the curious &s;pectator, and would in|cline him to believe it a work of human art, were it not, on the other hand, inconceivable that the
<PB N="442" REF="4500">
wit or invention of man &s;hould con&s;truct and com|bine &s;uch an infinite number of columns, which &s;hould have a general apparent likene&s;s, and yet be &s;o univer&s;aily di&s;&s;imilar in their figure as that, from the minute&s;t examination, not two in ten or twenty thou&s;and &s;hould be found, who&s;e angles and &s;ides are equal among them&s;elves, or of the one column to tho&s;e of the other. That it is the work of nature there can be no doubt to an atten|tive &s;pectator, who carefully &s;urveys the general form and &s;ituation, with the infinitely various figu|ration of the &s;everal parts of this cau&s;eway. There are no traces of regularity or de&s;ign in the out-lines of this curious phaenomenon; which, including the broken and detached pieces of the &s;ame kind of workman&s;hip, are extremely &s;cattered and con|fu&s;ed, and, whatever they might originally, do not, at pre&s;ent, appear to have any connection with the grand or principal cau&s;eway, as to any &s;uppo&s;able de&s;ign or u&s;e in its fir&s;t con&s;truction, and as little de&s;ign can be inferred from the figure or &s;ituation of the &s;everal con&s;tituent parts. The whole exhibition is, indeed, extremely con|fu&s;ed, di&s;uniform, and de&s;titute of every appear|ance of u&s;e or de&s;ign in its original con&s;truction. But what, beyond di&s;pute, determines its original to have been from nature is, that the very cliffs, at a great di&s;tance from the cau&s;eway, e&s;pecially in the bay to the ea&s;tward, exhibit, at many places, the &s;ame kind of columns, figured and jointed in all re&s;pects like tho&s;e of the grand cau&s;e|way; &s;ome of them are &s;een near to the top of the cliff, which in general, in the&s;e bays to the ea&s;t and we&s;t of the cau&s;eway, is near three hun|dred feet in height; others again are &s;een about midway, and at different elevations from the &s;trand. A very con&s;iderable expo&s;ure of them is
<PB N="443" REF="4510">
&s;een in the very bottom of the bay to the ea&s;tward, near a hundred rods from the cau&s;eway, where the earth has evidently fallen away from them upon the &s;trand, and exhibits a mo&s;t curious arrange|ment of many of the&s;e pentagonal columns, in a perpendicular po&s;ition, &s;upporting, in appearance, a cliff of different &s;trata of earth, clay, rock, &amp;c. to the height of one hundred and fifty feet or more, above. Some of the&s;e columns are between thirty and forty feet high, from the top of the &s;loping bank below them; and, being longe&s;t in the mid|dle of the arrangement, &s;hortening on either hand in view, they have obtained the appellation of organs, from a rude likene&s;s, indeed, in this par|ticular to the exterior or frontal tubes of that in|&s;trument; and as there are very few broken pieces on the &s;trand near it, it is probable that the out|&s;ide range of columns that now appears, is really the original exterior line, to the &s;eaward, of this collection. But how far they extend internally into the bowels of the encumbent cliff, may be worthy the examination of any curious gentleman in the neighbourhood, by running an arch or cavern on one or both &s;ides, to trace the internal &s;cope of this particular arrangement, which may be about thirty feet wide, and is compo&s;ed of the loftie&s;t co|lumns of any that are found in, or about, the cau&s;eway. The very &s;ub&s;tance, indeed, of that part of the cliff which projects to a point, between the two bays on the ea&s;t and we&s;t of the cau&s;eway, &s;eems compo&s;ed of this kind of materials; for be|&s;ides the many pieces that are &s;een on the &s;ides of the cliff that circulate to the bottom of the bays, particularly the ea&s;tern &s;ide, there is, at the very point of the cliff, and ju&s;t above the narrow and highe&s;t part of the cau&s;eway, a long collection of them &s;een, who&s;e heads or tops ju&s;t appearing without the &s;loping bank, plainly &s;hew them to
<PB N="444" REF="4520">
be in an oblique po&s;ition, and about halfway be|tween the perpendicular and horizontal. The heads of the&s;e, likewi&s;e, are of mixt &s;urfaces, convex and concave, and the columns evidently appear to have been removed from their original upright, to their pre&s;ent inclining or oblique po|&s;ition, by the &s;inking or falling of the cliff; nor do I make any doubt, that the whole cau&s;eway, that runs out from thence to the &s;ea was, ori|ginally, concealed in the very bowels of a &s;uper|encumbent cliff, that, by degrees, has fallen off it; and the loo&s;er earth being wa&s;hed away, has left this more fixed and mo&s;t curious columnal combination expo&s;ed to view, and which will pro|bably remain for ages a monument of the &s;uperior and exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip of nature. The circum&s;tance of its being the only phaenome|non of the kind that has yet been di&s;covered, is no di&s;proof of its natural origin; or it is an equal pre&s;umption again&s;t its being the work of human art. For neither art nor nature, perhaps, in any part of the known world, has exhibited a con&s;truction like it. That there is nothing of the &s;ame kind to be met with, makes this, in|deed, the more extraordinary, and the more ju&s;t|ly de&s;erving the notice and admiration of the cu|rious; but nothing can be inferred from thence alone as to its origin. The romantic &s;uppo&s;ition of its having been a cau&s;eway from Ireland to Scot|land is ridiculous and ab&s;urd at fir&s;t view. The neare&s;t coa&s;t of Scotland to this place is at lea&s;t thirty miles: if any u&s;e or de&s;ign of this kind can be imagined ever to have taken place, it mu&s;t have been to &s;ome i&s;land not far from the &s;hore, which the &s;ea has &s;wallowed up. But the gene|ral form and con&s;truction of the &s;everal parts is at the utmo&s;t di&s;tance from favouring &s;uch a &s;uppo|&s;ition. Nor is the ridiculous opinion that is met
<PB N="445" REF="4530">
with in &s;ome of the old natural hi&s;tories of this kingdom le&s;s ab&s;urd, on a compari&s;on that is made of this to Stonehenge on Sali&s;bury-plain, that this, as well as that, may have been originally a Druid temple, or &s;ome antient place of wor&s;hip; for there is no more likene&s;s in the compari&s;on than would be found between two of the mo&s;t di&s;&s;imilar productions of art or nature. Into &s;uch ridiculous fancies will men &s;uffer them&s;elves to be led who have never &s;een the originals of which they pretend to give a de&s;cription; but implicity write from the authority of others, equally with them&s;elves, unacquainted with them. The truth is, that from the mo&s;t exact &s;urvey, and the mi|nute&s;t examination, of this mo&s;t &s;ingular and cu|rious phaenomenon, the total ab&s;ence of every ap|pearance of de&s;ign or u&s;e that can be di&s;covered, it may ju&s;tly be looked upon as a lu&s;us naturae: if there are any exhibitions in nature that may be called &s;uch, this is &s;uper-eminently one of them. With re&s;pect to the manner of its original produc|tion, it &s;hould &s;eem to be a rocky concre&s;&s;ence or vegetation, of a &s;imilar natural proce&s;s with many &s;parry or lapidar productions that are found in &s;ome parts both of England and Ireland. This, however, I &s;peak with diffidence, and &s;ubmit to the judgment of more curious naturali&s;ts. That &s;tones of many, and perhaps of all, kinds do really grow from a le&s;&s;er to a larger &s;ize, is, at this time, a well known truth. Whether the&s;e have en|crea&s;ed in their magnitude &s;ince the memory of man, there have been no ob&s;ervations made by any gentleman in the country: though &s;uch ea&s;ily might have been made, with re&s;pect to any particular pillar or column, a little de|tached from the re&s;t. But, indeed, whether they grew to this &s;urprizing and mo&s;t &s;ingular form and connection with each other, by any na|tural
<PB N="446" REF="4540">
vegetative proce&s;s, or were originally brought into it at once by the omnipotent fiat of nature, is, at this time, and probably ever will be, an ab&s;o|lutely indi&s;coverable &s;ecret. The &s;ingularity, however, as well as figure of the phaenomenon, is very extraordinary, that there &s;hould never, in any part of the world, be any production of a &s;imi|lar kind to this yet di&s;covered, not even in Ireland it&s;elf, is a circum&s;tance, indeed, amazing, and that very ju&s;tly places this at the head of natural curio&s;ities.</P>

<P>Lough-Neagh, on which this town &s;tands, is the large&s;t lake in Ireland, over&s;preading near one hundred thou&s;and acres of land; but it is not di|ver&s;ified and adorned with i&s;lands and woods like Lough-Earne. Being the receptacle of &s;everal rivers and brooks, and having but a narrow out-let into the &s;ea thro' the Lower Bann, it generally ri&s;es in the winter &s;ea&s;on eight or ten feet above its level, &s;ometimes overflowing the low grounds on its coa&s;t. The waters of the lake are &s;aid to have a petrifying virtue, and to cure evils, ulcers, and running &s;ores.

It is thirty-eight miles long, twenty four broad, contains eight baronies, and about two hundred and twenty-four thou&s;and eight hundred and &s;even acres. A great part of it is taken up with bogs, and that prodigi|ous lake called Lough-Earne, which is near twenty miles in length, and in &s;ome places fourteen in breadth, being diver&s;ified with upwards of three hundred i&s;lands, mo&s;t of them well wooded, inhabited, and covered with cattle.

It contains &s;even baronies and two hundred and &s;eventy-four thou&s;and eight hundred acres, &s;ends &s;ix members to parliament, viz. two for the county, and two each for the boroughs of Cavan and Belturbet; and gives the title of earl to the family of Lambert. The air is not unhealthy, tho' there is much boggy ground in &s;ome places. The greater part however is well cultivated and inhabited.</P>
<P>Cavan is the county-town. In 1690 a great part of it was burnt down, with all the forage of the rebels; and colonel Wor&s;eley, at the head of the Inni&s;killin men and one thou&s;and regulars, de|feated four thou&s;and, under the duke of Berwick.</P>

It is in length thirty-two miles, in breadth &s;even|teen, and is divided into five baronies, containing about one hundred and &s;eventy thou&s;and &s;ix hun|dred and twenty acres. Both the air and &s;oil are good, e&s;pecially the latter, which is &s;aid to be the riche&s;t in Ireland; only there is a certain tract in it called the Fewes, that is, hilly and barren. The members it &s;ends to parliament are &s;ix, viz.
<PB N="452" REF="4600">
two for the city of Armagh, two for the county, and two for the borough of Charlemont.</P>
<P>Armagh, &s;tanding near the river Kalin, gives name to the county, and is the &s;ee of the primate of all Ireland. It is &s;aid to have been founded by St. Patrick in the fifth century; and in 1142, it was con&s;tituted an archbi&s;hopric, together with Dublin, Ca&s;hel, and Tuam, by cardinal Papyreo, with the con&s;ent of the king, dukes, bi&s;hops, abbots, and &s;tates of Ireland. This Papyreo was &s;ent into Ireland by pope Eugenius, to reform the abu&s;es that had crept into the church-di&s;cipline of that country. Here was antiently a famous mo|na&s;tery built by St. Columba, or Columbanus, about the year 610. This town was fir&s;t &s;ub|jected to the Engli&s;h by John de Courcy; but af|terwards entirely de&s;troyed by Tir Cen, or O Neal, in queen Elizabeth's time. However, it was after|wards recovered, rebuilt, and garri&s;oned by the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>Charlemont took its name from a fort or mount built by Charles Blount, lord Mountjoy, and from him called Charlemont. It &s;tands on the river Blackwater, near the borders of Tyrone, and gives the title of earl and vi&s;count to the family of Caul|field.</P>
<P>Portadown, Portendown, or Portnadown, is a &s;mall place upon the Bann, over which it has a bridge.</P>
<P>Lurgan is one of the prettie&s;t market-towns of the north of Ireland. It &s;tands near Lough-Neagh, and much re&s;embles one of our &s;pacious thoroughfare - towns in the high roads near the capital. From the &s;imilarity of its ge|neral figure, of the language, manners, and di&s;|po&s;itions of its inhabitants to tho&s;e of the Eng|li&s;h, it hath for many years acquired the name of Little England.

<HEAD>DOWN.</HEAD>
<P>The county of Down is bounded on the north by the county of Antrim; on the we&s;t by the county of Armagh; and on the ea&s;t and &s;outh by St. George's channel. It is fruitful and populous, enjoying a good air. The length of the county is about forty|four Engli&s;h miles, and the breadth upwards of thirty. It is divided into &s;even baronies, contain|ing &s;eventy-two pari&s;hes, and about five hundred and fifty-eight thou&s;and two hundred and eighty|nine thou&s;and Engli&s;h acres. Be&s;ides the two members for the county, two are &s;ent to parlia|ment for each of the following towns, viz. Down-Patrick, Newry, Newton, Killeagh, Bangor, and Hill&s;borough.</P>
<P>Down-Patrick is a very antient-town and a bi|&s;hop's &s;ee, erected about the end of the fifth cen|tury by St. Patrick, and now united to Connor. In the antient cathedral, of which the ruins are &s;till vi&s;ible near the town, it is pretended that St. Patrick, St. Bridget, and St. Columb were buried. It is al&s;o &s;aid that Magnus, king of Norway, was interred near it, having been &s;lain by the Iri&s;h, when he landed to take a view of the country, before
<PB N="454" REF="4620">
he di&s;embarked his forces. Be&s;ides the cathedral, there were four religious hou&s;es here antiently, and the prior had a &s;eat in parliament. The town &s;tands on the lake of Strangford, which abounds with &s;al|mon, mullet, and other fi&s;h, is the re&s;ort of &s;wans and various kinds of water-fowl, and contains many plea&s;ant i&s;lands. Here are &s;everal hand&s;ome public buildings, as the church, the &s;e&s;&s;ions-hou&s;e, two alms-hou&s;es, two &s;chools, a market-hou&s;e, and barracks for a troop of hor&s;e. Not far from the town are the ruins of a mona&s;tery founded by St. Patrick for ca|nons regular, about the middle of the fifth century; and in an i&s;le, oppo&s;ite the cathedral, are the ruins of the Inch-abbey, i. e. the abbey in the i&s;land, founded by John de Courcy about the year 1180, and &s;upplied with Ci&s;tercian monks from Furne&s;s in Lanca&s;hire. About a mile from the town is St. Patrick's well, to which great numbers of &s;u|per&s;titious people flock at certain times; &s;ome to perform penance, others in hopes of relief in va|rious di&s;orders, by drinking or wa&s;hing in the wa|ter, which is &s;aid to have been ble&s;&s;ed by St. Pa|trick. The linen manufacture flouri&s;hes about this town, which gives title of vi&s;count to the family of Dawney.</P>
<P>Newry &s;tands near a river of the &s;ame name, over which it has two bridges, and was founded in the reign of queen Elizabeth by Nicholas Bag|nal, mar&s;hal of Ireland. But long before that period, there was an abbey of Ci&s;tercian monks here. Of its antient ca&s;tle there are &s;till &s;ome re|mains. The town was twice de&s;troyed by the Iri&s;h rebels, fir&s;t in 1641, and again in 1689; but hath &s;o well recovered it&s;elf &s;ince, as to be counted at pre&s;ent the large&s;t and mo&s;t trading town of the county, for which happy change it is principally indebted to the linen manufacture. The canal for inland navigation, which terminates
<PB N="455" REF="4630">
in the river here, is another great advantage to it. The town is a great thoroughfare, tho' &s;urrounded with hills and mountains, except to the north, where the canal runs. A garri&s;on is con&s;tantly kept in this place.</P>
<P>Newton &s;tands at the north end of the lake of Strangford. It had antiently a convent of Domi|nican friars; but is remarkable at pre&s;ent for its fine diaper and quarries of free-&s;tone.</P>
<P>Killeleagh is &s;ituated al&s;o upon the lake of Strangford, of which it has an agreeable pro&s;pect. It had the honour to give birth to that great natu|rali&s;t and phy&s;ician Sir Hans Sloane. There is a hand&s;ome church, a ca&s;tle, barracks for a troop of dragoons, a bridge over a little river that runs by the town, and a &s;afe commodious harbour, formed by a little bay at the lower end of it. The linen manufacture al&s;o flouri&s;hes in this borough. It is governed by a provo&s;t, who, with twelve burge&s;&s;es, chu&s;e the members of parliament.</P>
<P>Bangor contains between two and three hun|dred hou&s;es, and has a con&s;iderable manufacture for linen yarn. It &s;tands on Carrickfergus-bay, and is governed by a provo&s;t and twelve burge&s;&s;es, who chu&s;e the members of parliament. Here are &s;till &s;een the ruins of a very antient abbey. Duke Schomberg landed with the forces under his com|mand at this town in 1689. The fir&s;t church of &s;tonein the province of Ul&s;ter is &s;aid to have been erected here.</P>
<P>Hill&s;borough gives the title of earl and vi&s;count to the family of Hill, from whom it derives its name. It is &s;ituated on a dry gravelly &s;oil, and governed by a &s;overeign, as the chief magi&s;trate is called, and twelve burge&s;&s;es, who elect the repre|&s;entatives in parliament.</P>
<P>The other places worth mentioning, be&s;ides the parliamentary boroughs, are</P>
<P><PB N="456" REF="4640">
Ro&s;s-Trevor, which though but a &s;mall place, on the north-&s;ide of Carlingford-haven, yet has a good key, within a few yards of which &s;hips may ride at anchor. It has al&s;o a &s;alt-hou&s;e, and a pottery of the fine potters-clay found near Car|rickfergus, of which large quantities are exported.</P>
<P>Briansford, or Tullimore, gives title of baron to the earl of Charleville. Here are two deer|parks finely wooded and watered, belonging to the earl of Clanbra&s;&s;il, where the goat-whey drinkers, in the &s;pring and &s;ummer, find both health and amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>Rathfryland, or Rathon-I&s;land, is built on a hill, and &s;hews the ruins of a ca&s;tle, antiently the man&s;ion-hou&s;e of Macginnis, lord Eveagh; but the town now belongs to&mdash;Magil, e&s;quire, is a great thoroughfare between Newry and Down-Patrick, and one of the greate&s;t markets for linen in the county.</P>
<P>Dundrum, where are the remains of a &s;trong ca&s;tle that belonged formerly to the above-men|tioned Macginnis. The bay, which takes its name from this place, is &s;pacious, and abounds in fi&s;h, particularly trout and flat fi&s;h; but it is dangerous for &s;hipping.</P>
<P>Killogh, or Port St. Anne, where are barracks for two troops of dragoons, a prote&s;tant working-&s;chool, &s;alt-works, and a commodious key and ba&s;on for &s;hips of good burden. Its trade is con&s;iderable, e&s;pecially in exporting barley. The point or head near this town, called by Ptolemy, I&s;&s;anium, and now St. John's Foreland, is the mo&s;t ea&s;tern part of the kingdom.</P>
<P>Ardgla&s;s, before the reign of queen Eliza|beth, was the mo&s;t noted place for trade in Ul&s;ter, and is &s;aid al&s;o to have been formerly a parliamen|tary borough; but the privilege of &s;ending mem|bers to parliament is lo&s;t, and Killogh hath got all its trade. The greate&s;t part of the town, with a good
<PB N="457" REF="4650">
e&s;tate in the neighbourhood, belongs to the duke of Lein&s;ter. The right honourable lord-vi&s;count Barrington takes the title of baron from hence.</P>
<P>Strangford is a &s;mall but antient town, &s;itu|ated on the river or lake of Strangford, tho' it is in reality an arm of the &s;ea. This town gives title of vi&s;count to the family of Smyth; and takes its name from the rapidity of the tides, which is &s;o great here, both at flood and ebb, that it carries boats at the rate of &s;ix knots or miles in an hour. The lake, or arm of the &s;ea, is about &s;even|teen miles long, and four broad at a medium, and abounds with variety of fi&s;h, as ba&s;s, mullet, whiting, large &s;ea-trouts, oy&s;ters, lob&s;ters, &s;hrimps, &amp;c. There is a rock in the middle of the mouth or entrance of the lake dangerous to &s;uch as are unacquainted with it, even in calm weather, on account of the rapidity of the current; but there is a broad pa&s;|&s;age and deep water on either &s;ide. The town is &s;ituated on the &s;outh-we&s;t &s;ide, about a league from the bar or entrance, and belongs to the duke of Lein&s;ter.</P>
<P>The lake of Strangford contains upwards of &s;ixty i&s;lands. On the we&s;t &s;ide of it is a group of &s;mall i&s;lands called the Scattheric i&s;lands, &s;ome of which are noted for fattening and re&s;toring di&s;tem|pered hor&s;es; many of them are &s;tocked with rab|bits, while others have a great re&s;ort of &s;wans to them, and of various kinds of fowl, &s;uch as wild gee&s;e, great flights of barnacles, &s;weet and well flavoured ducks, gold-heads, wigeon, teal, and four or five &s;orts of divers. A great deal of &s;ea-weed is burnt into kelp on the i&s;lands, and a flat &s;toney coa&s;t &s;urrounding the lake, by which a num|ber of hands are employed.</P>
<P>Portaferry is a town of &s;ome trade in the barony of Ards, oppo&s;ite to Strangford, between which the communication is kept up by a ferry-boat.</P>

<P>Ballynahinch, or Maghedrol, is a great tho|roughfare. Here, and the neighbouring country, the linen manufacture is carried on very &s;ucce&s;s|fully. Tho' the &s;oil about the town is but coar&s;e, yet it produces good oats, flax, and potatoes. As the papi&s;ts are numerous in this part of the country, the &s;ociety for promoting Engli&s;h pro|te&s;tant working-&s;chools have &s;ettled one in this place, for the education of poor popi&s;h children in the prote&s;tant religion.</P>
<P>Dromore is a market-town and bi&s;hopric, found|ed by St. Coleman in the &s;ixth century; but there are no revenues for the maintenance of a choir. Here is the dioce&s;e-&s;chool, and an Eng|li&s;h prote&s;tant-&s;chool, where poor children are in|&s;tructed in the prote&s;tant religion, &s;et to work, and &s;ome of them cloathed. The bi&s;hop has an e&s;tate near the town, and a tolerable cathedral in it. At the ea&s;t-end of it is a Dani&s;h mount or fortification, very large, defended with broad ramparts, trenches, battlements, and parapets. The linen manfacture flouri&s;hes in this place, which &s;tands on one &s;ide of the river Logan.</P>

About this place the linen manufacture thrives exceedingly, every farmer having &s;ome &s;hare in it. Marle-pits have been opened here, and many other parts of the county.</P>
<P>Waring's-town is a village belonging to&mdash;Waring, e&s;quire, in which al&s;o the linen manu|facture is carried on with &s;ucce&s;s. Here is another Dani&s;h mount, which, when opened in 1681, was found a &s;epulchre.</P>
<P>Banbridge, about which are many bleach-yards, the water of the river Bann, on which the village &s;tands, and from which and the bridge over it, it takes its name, being accounted very proper for that purpo&s;e. Here are held the greate&s;t fairs in the kingdom for linen-cloth.</P>
<P>Loughbrickland has its name from a lough in the neighbourhood. The turnpike road from Dublin to Belfa&s;t and Antrim pa&s;&s;es by it.

The&s;e mountains are com|mons to the whole county, and afford pa&s;ture to great numbers of cattle, with quarries of mill-&s;tone, and a great variety of plants, &s;hrubs, and me|dicinal herbs, on which, as the goats principally feed, their milk and whey is thereby rendered &s;o nouri&s;hing and re&s;torative, that numbers of con|&s;umptive, valetudinary people come hither by the advice of their phy&s;icians to drink it.</P>
<P>In the river Bann is a pearl fi&s;hery, which for|merly turned to &s;ome account; but at pre&s;ent to very little, few of the mu&s;cles that contain the pearls being now found, and tho&s;e only in &s;mooth deep water.

The pearl is found at the &s;maller end of the &s;hell, be|tween the two films that line it, at the extremity of the gut, and without the body of the fi&s;h. In this county is a &s;ociety incorporated by James II. by the &s;tile and title of the governor and freemen of the corporation of hor&s;e-breeders, in the coun|ty of Down. The de&s;ign of this &s;ociety being to promote and improve the breed of hor&s;es, many of the nobility and gentry, e&s;pecially of this county, have been members of it, and even &s;ome of the chief governors. The gold medal worn by the governor and freemen has on one &s;ide a mare, with a foal &s;ucking her, and this motto, En equis patrum virtus.

Lein&s;ter in general is very well cultivated, enjoys a good air and &s;oil, and abounds in corn, cattle, fi&s;h, and fowl. Its principal rivers are the Boyne, Barrow, Liffy, Nuer, Slane, or Urrin, and the May, of which the fir&s;t is famous for the victory obtained on its banks by king William over king James, and gives title of vi&s;count to a family of the name of Hamilton.

<P>Dundalk is the &s;hire town, and has a good mar|ket, but an indifferent harbour. It is very &s;trong both by nature and art. In 1649 the re|bels quitted it after Oliver Cromwell had &s;tormed Drogheda; and in 1689, it was abandoned by the popi&s;h garri&s;on, at the approach of duke Schomberg. Near this town, Edward Bruce, the brother of Robert king of Scots, was cut off, with eight thou&s;and two hundred of his men.</P>
<P>Drogheda &s;tands near the mouth of the Boyne, on a bay of its own name, twenty miles from Dub|lin, and is the chief town of the county. The harbour here is good, tho' the entrance is &s;ome|what difficult; and there is a pretty bri&s;k trade, e&s;pecially to the north of England, for which it is very conveniently &s;ituated. Among other com|modities, they bring from England a great quan|tity of coals, not only for the u&s;e of the town, but of the country around, conveying them to a great di&s;tance by means of the Boyne, which divides the town into two parts, and has a bridge over it. Several privileges were granted to this place by Edward II. in particular that of a mint; and in 1365 an academy was erected here, with as ample privileges as the univer&s;ity of Oxford; but for want of proper &s;upport, it came to nothing. Drogheda made a gallant defence in 1641 under lord Moor and Sir Henry Tichburn; but was at la&s;t taken by the duke of Ormond and lord Inchikin. When Cromwell took it by &s;torm in 1649, he put the whole garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of four thou&s;and men, to the &s;word. King James's garri&s;on &s;urrendered it to king William immediately after the battle at the Boyne. From this town the family of Moor derive the title of earl.</P>

Kildare on the we&s;t; and the Iri&s;h &s;ea, or St. George's channel, on the ea&s;t. It is about twenty-&s;ix miles in length from north to &s;outh, and fif|teen from ea&s;t to we&s;t. This county, excepting a mountainous tract in the &s;outh part of it, is very populous and fertile, abounding with all the nece&s;&s;aries of life, but wood, in lieu of which they burn turf and &s;ea coal. It far exceeds any other part of the kingdom, not only in populou&s;|ne&s;s, culture, trade, and wealth, but politene&s;s, elegance, ingenuity, and every &s;pecies of refine|ment and improvement. It contains &s;ix baronies, viz. Rathdown, Newca&s;tle, Ca&s;tleknoc, Cowloc, Balrodry, and Nethercro&s;s; &s;ending to parlia|ment two knights for the &s;hire, four members for Dublin and its univer&s;ity, and two a piece for the boroughs of Swords and Newca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The city of Dublin, the capital of the kingdom, is &s;ituated on the river Liffy, near the bottom of a beautiful bay, to which it gives name, and which is three or four miles wide at its entrance, and &s;even or eight deep, with hills and promontories on either hand. It is a large, populous, and, for the greater part, a well built city; not much em|belli&s;hed, indeed, with grand or magnificent build|ings: a few, however, there are, of which the college or univer&s;ity, the parliament hou&s;es, the King's, the Lying-in ho&s;pital, and Swift's for lu|natics, with the duke of Lein&s;ter's-hou&s;e, are the principal. The churches in general make but a very indifferent figure as to their architecture; and are almo&s;t entirely de&s;titute of monumental ornaments. The two hou&s;es of parliament are infinitely &s;uperior, in point of grandeur and magnificence, to tho&s;e of We&s;tmin&s;ter. The hou&s;e of lords is, perhaps, as elegant a room as any in Great Britain or Ire|land. The college-library, from the number of
<PB N="468" REF="4770">
volumes it contains, the magnificence and neat|ne&s;s of the rooms, and the convenient di&s;po|&s;ition of the books and de&s;ks for the u&s;e of the &s;tudents, is well worthy attention. The ca&s;tle, as it is called, from one once &s;ituated there, of which, at pre&s;ent, there are very few remains, is the re&s;idence of the lord-lieutenant when in Ire|land; but has very little of grandeur in its external appearance be&s;ides the large &s;quare and court|yard which it enclo&s;es. Some of the rooms, however, are large and elegant. The whole ex|tent of the city of Dublin is about one-third of London, including We&s;tmin&s;ter and South|wark; and one fourth, at lea&s;t, of the whole has been built within the&s;e forty years. Tho&s;e parts of the town that have been added &s;ince that time are &s;ub&s;tantially built, and the &s;treets, in general, well laid out, e&s;pecially on the north-&s;ide of the river, where the mo&s;t con&s;iderable addi|tions have been made within the term above-mentioned. There are on this &s;ide many &s;pacious and regular &s;treets, particularly Sackville-&s;treet, in the north-ea&s;t part of the town, which, with &s;ome alterations and improvements, would have been one of the fine&s;t, perhaps, in Europe. The mo&s;t elegant and be&s;t fini&s;hed piece of architecture in Dublin is the Lying - in ho&s;pital. The view of Dublin from the top of any of their towers is the mo&s;t beautiful, perhaps, of any large city in the king's dominions, in a &s;imilar point of view, from the neatne&s;s of the blue &s;lating with which the hou&s;es are univer&s;ally covered. The bay below the city to the ea&s;t, with the adjacent country, adds greatly to the beauty of the pro&s;pect. The river Liffy, which runs thro' almo&s;t the centre of the city, from we&s;t to ea&s;t, and contributes much to its health, is but a &s;mall river, about one
<PB N="469" REF="4780">
fifth as wide as the Thames at London, con&s;e|quently cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed capable of bringing up to the town &s;hips of above one hundred and fifty or two hundred tons burden. Over this river there are five bridges, of which that called E&s;&s;ex bridge is well built, &s;pacious, and elegant. As a fine exchange is intended to be erected in this city, premiums have been lately offered and adverti&s;ed for the three be&s;t plans. There are two elegant theatres here, in which plays are acted as in Lon|don, be&s;ides a third, which has been &s;hut for &s;e|veral years. The old hou&s;e in Smock-alley, tho' not &s;o large as the new in Crow-&s;treet, is one of the be&s;t con&s;tructed theatres, both for the audience and the actors, that can be imagined. Here are &s;ummer entertainments too, in imitation of tho&s;e of London. Adjoining to the Lying - in ho&s;|pital, and belonging to it, is a large &s;quare piece of ground inclo&s;ed, and three &s;ides out of four very prettily laid out in walks, plantations of &s;hrubs, trees, &amp;c. and on the fourth &s;tands the ho&s;pital, On the &s;ide of the green, op|po&s;ite the ho&s;pital, the ground being much higher, is formed into a fine hanging bank, with a &s;lope of near thirty feet, on the top of which is laid out a grand terrace-walk, commanding a fine view of the ho&s;pital. On the upper &s;ide of this terrace, and nearly encompa&s;&s;ed by the groves and &s;hrubberies, is built a very pretty orche&s;tra. This garden, the mo&s;t agreeable about Dublin, is much frequented in the fine &s;ummer evenings by the genteel company of the city: and though not &s;o generally calculated for a mu&s;ical entertainment as the garden of Vaux|hall, near London, yet there are &s;ome walks in it where the mu&s;ic has a finer effect than in many of the other. The greate&s;t defect of this large and po|pulous
<PB N="470" REF="4790">
city is the almo&s;t total want of good inns for the accommodation of &s;trangers and travellers. There are not above two or three that are barely tolerable. Dublin is the &s;ee of an archbi&s;hop, who has a hand&s;ome cathedral, and a chapter con&s;i&s;ting of a dean, chanter, chancellor, trea|&s;urer, two archdeacons, and twenty-two preben|daries. Here is a &s;ociety, called the Dublin &s;o|ciety, which hath been of infinite benefit to the kingdom by di&s;tributing premiums, to a very con&s;iderable amount, yearly, for encouraging and promoting hu&s;bandry, and other u&s;eful arts and manufactures. The chief magi&s;trate, or mayor of Dublin, as in London, bears the title of lord during his mayoralty. Every year the lord-mayor and twenty-four companies perambulate the city and its liberties. The provi&s;ions of this city are gene|rally good, and at a rea&s;onable price, liquors e&s;pe|cially. The be&s;t &s;pirits may be had at half the price they &s;ell for in London. Their wine is chiefly claret, the common price of which is two &s;hillings; and the be&s;t that the town affords, may be had for two &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence the bottle. The rates of hackney coaches and chairs are fixed here, as in London, for the different di&s;tances, or &s;et - downs, as they are called. But here are two &s;orts of carriages peculiar to the place. The one is called a noddy, which is nothing more than an old ca&s;t-off one hor&s;e chai&s;e, or chair, with a kind of &s;tool fixed upon the &s;hafts, ju&s;t before the &s;eat, on which the driver &s;its ju&s;t over the rump of the hor&s;e, and drives you from one part of the town to ano|ther, at &s;tated rates, for a &s;et-down. Tho' it is neither a very &s;afe nor ea&s;y vehicle, yet it is conveni|ent for &s;ingle per&s;ons, the fare being not much more than half that of a coach; and they will go to any
<PB N="471" REF="4800">
part of the kingdom on the terms you can agree. The other is called a chai&s;e-marine, and is little el&s;e than a common car with one hor&s;e. They are u&s;ed throughout the kingdom for the conveyance of people on parties of plea&s;ure, genteel and ungenteel, and for the carriage of goods and merchandize of every kind, hay, &s;traw, corn, dung, turf, &amp;c. When u&s;ed for parties of plea&s;ure, a mat is laid on the le|vel part for the commonalty; and, for the genteeler &s;ort, a bed is put on this. The inhabitants of Dublin pretend to &s;peak Engli&s;h better than tho&s;e of Lon|don, and have even the ridiculous vanity to arro|gate to them&s;elves a higher degree of politene&s;s and gentility, and a more refined ta&s;te. The number of the inhabitants of this city is computed at about three hundred thou&s;and, and gives the title of earl to his royal highne&s;s the duke of Cum|berland. The environs of the city are very plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>About &s;even miles from it, on the Li&s;&s;y, is Lei&s;lip, one of the plea&s;ante&s;t villages in Ireland. There are &s;everal &s;eats of the fir&s;t families in the kingdom about this village; in particular, a very beautiful one belonging to the archbi&s;hop of Ar|magh, the gardens of which are extremely de|lightful, lying on a declivity along the &s;ide of the river, very &s;teep to the edge of the water, and &s;kirted from top to bottom with trees of various kinds, where the roaring of a fall at the height of &s;ixty or &s;eventy feet above it has a very agreeable effect, together with &s;everal vi&s;tas in the wood ter|minating on the fall or river.

<P>This county has that of Wexford on the &s;outh; that of Dublin and part of Kildare on the north; St. George's channel or the ea&s;t; and Kildare and Catherlogh counties on the we&s;t. Its length, where longe&s;t, is thirty-&s;ix miles, and its greate&s;t breadth twenty-eight. It is divided into &s;ix baro|nies. There are &s;ome pretty high mountains in this county, in one of which there is a cop|per-mine, wrought at the expence of &s;ome Engli&s;h gentlemen. The lowlands are pretty well inhabited, enclo&s;ed, and cultivated, the &s;oil being good and the air whole&s;ome. From the mountains in this county, one may &s;ee, in a clear day, very di&s;tinctly the mountains of Snowdown in North Wales. In the Wicklow mountains, are al&s;o &s;ome of tho&s;e deep dark vallies called glyns, very beautiful and picture&s;que, together with &s;ome grand and a&s;toni&s;hing water-falls. Among the former, the dark glyn and the glyn of the mountains, are particularly remarkable. "The dark glyn, &s;ays the author of the Hibernia Curio|&s;a, is much vi&s;ited in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on by the gentry from Dublin, and mo&s;t of the people of fortune that come to this city. It is equal, if not

&s;uperior, to any of the kind in the kingdom, one of the deepe&s;t, and at the &s;ame time, the narrowe&s;t, and mo&s;t orriguous vallies I remember to have &s;een. The &s;ides of the hills which &s;kirt it, adorned with trees to the very tops, and intermixed with rocky precipices, together with the murmuring of a little river at the bottom, that winds its way thro' this intricate valley over numberle&s;s little breaks and falls, that add greatly to the beauty of the &s;cene, render it altogether a mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;ummer recreation. The clo&s;ene&s;s of the lofty &s;hading hills on the &s;ides, at the &s;ame time that it affords a mo&s;t delightful cool retreat from the heat of the &s;un, throws a kind of gloomy &s;olemnity on the bottom of this deep valley; and from this cir|cum&s;tance it is very properly called the dark glyn. It is rather a deep cha&s;m than a valley, extending about a mile, through a lofty range of hills. At the very bottom of the glyn is a way cut out by the &s;ide of the &s;tream, and adapted to the gloomy retirement of the place, where the lover, the poet, or philo&s;opher, may wander with every circum&s;tance, every &s;cene about him, calculated to warm his imagination, or produce the mo&s;t &s;e|rious reflections. The glyn of the mountains in this neighbourhood is a more open and &s;pacious valley, but immen&s;ely deep, and &s;kirted on either hand with the mo&s;t enormous a&s;toni&s;hing moun|tains, covered for the mo&s;t part with trees from their bottoms to the very tops, pre&s;enting a pro&s;pect of the mo&s;t horrible impending rocks. The bottom of the valley is ju&s;t wide enough for a road and a river that runs through it. There is &s;omething inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;triking, beautiful, grand, and awful in this &s;cene." The&s;e glyns are not far from Power&s;court, a mo&s;t beautiful &s;eat, fourteen miles from Dublin, belonging and giving the ti|tle of vi&s;count to the family of Wingfield. Near

this charming &s;eat is one of the mo&s;t beautiful wa|ter-falls in the world, called the Fall of Power&s;|court, which, from the peculiarity of its &s;ituation, its prodigious height and &s;ingular beauty, well de&s;erves the notice of every traveller. It is pro|duced by a &s;mall river ari&s;ing from &s;prings and rains collected on the plains or &s;hallow vallies, on the top of an adjacent range of mountains, and falls at lea&s;t three hundred feet, of which two hun|dred are vi&s;ible on the plain below. The only time to &s;ee this mo&s;t beautiful and a&s;toni&s;hing wa|ter-fall in its highe&s;t perfection is immediately after heavy rains on the mountains above. No de&s;cription can then convey an adequate idea of the beauty and grandeur of the &s;cene, or the tran&s;port of the &s;pectator. The trees which grow from the bottom to the top of the hill, on the &s;ides of this prodigious water-fall, are an inexpre&s;&s;ible addition to its charms. The whole &s;cenery in|deed, above and below, is the mo&s;t extraordinary and entertaining of its kind that can be conceived. At lord Power&s;court's delicious &s;eat mentioned above, is a large grove of the arbutus or &s;traw|berry-tree, one of the mo&s;t beautiful ever-greens, perhaps, that our climate produces, having, at the &s;ame time, bloom, green, and ripe fruit on its branches; but it has not tho&s;e ornaments through|out the year, as, without &s;ufficient foundation, has been a&s;&s;erted. The fruit, by the natives in the neighbourhood, is called the cane-apple; when ripe it is in &s;hape much like the wood-&s;trawberry, but nearly as large as the garden-&s;trawberry, of a fine &s;carlet colour, and hangs in beautiful clu&s;ters among the branches: the ta&s;te, however, is in&s;i|pid. This county &s;ends ten members to parlia|ment, viz. two for the &s;hire, and two for each of the&s;e boroughs, Wicklow, Baltingla&s;s, Cary&s;|fort, and Ble&s;&s;ington.</P>
<P><PB N="479" REF="4880">
Wicklow gives name to the county, and is its capital. This town is noted for the be&s;t ale in Ireland. It has barracks for three companies of foot, and a kind of ca&s;tle and haven at the mouth of the river Leitrim; but mo&s;t of its trade con&s;i&s;ts in carrying provi&s;ions in &s;mall ve&s;&s;els to Dublin. It gives the title of baron to lord Maynard.</P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ington is a &s;mall town on the Liffy, giving the title of earl to a branch of the family of Stew|art. About two miles from it are three ca&s;tles on the Liffy.</P>
<P>Baltingla&s;s is a &s;mall town, &s;tanding on the river Urrin, and gives the title of baron to the family of Stratford.</P>
<P>Carysfort al&s;o is a &s;mall place, giving the title of baron to the family of Proby.</P>
<P>Arklow contains barracks for two companies of foot; it is a pretty town near the &s;ea, and at the mouth of a river, called by Ptolemy, Ovaca: for|merly it had a ca&s;tle belonging to the dukes of Ormond, who, among other titles of honour, &s;tiled them&s;elves lords of Arklow.</P>
<P>Dunlaven, though a &s;mall town, has a good market.</P>
<P>At Windgate is a remarkable heap of &s;tones, generally &s;uppo&s;ed to be a &s;epulchral monument.</P>
<P>Rathdrum, Bray, and Carnew, are all &s;mall places.</P>

<HEAD>CARLOW, CATHERLOGH, or CATHERLOUGH.</HEAD>
<P>This county has part of Kildare and Wicklow on the north; Wexford on the &s;outh; part of Wicklow and Wexford on the ea&s;t; and part of Queen's county and Kilkenny on the we&s;t. It is about twenty-eight miles from north to &s;outh, about eighteen from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and contains
<PB N="480" REF="4890">
five baronies, lying mo&s;tly between the rivers Barrow and Slane, which divide it from the coun|ties of Kilkenny and Wexford. This county, which enjoys a fruitful &s;oil and whole&s;ome air, &s;ends &s;ix members to parliament, viz. two for the &s;hire, and two each for the boroughs of Cather|logh and Old Leighlin.</P>
<P>Catherlogh, the county town, &s;tands on the Barrow, and contains barracks for a troop of hor&s;e, with an antient ca&s;tle. It gives the title of earl to a family of the &s;urname of Knight.</P>
<P>Old Leighlin, Laughlen, or Laughlin, was for|merly a bi&s;hop's &s;ee, now annexed to the bi&s;hop|ric of Fernes. At Leighlin bridge, a mile &s;outh of Old Leighlin, on the river Barrow, was antiently a commandery of the Knights Templars. Below Leighlin bridge, before it arrives at Ro&s;s, the Bar|row is joined by the Neor, from whence they both continue a &s;outherly cour&s;e under the name of the river of Ro&s;s, &s;outh of which, being increa&s;ed by the Sure, they are all three lo&s;t in the &s;ea at Hook-point, which lies at the mouth of the haven of Waterford.</P>
<P>Tullagh, or Tullo, &s;tands on the river Slane, is pretty well built, and has a good market.</P>
<P>Hacket's town, Bagnal's town, and Clonegal, are all &s;mall places.</P>
