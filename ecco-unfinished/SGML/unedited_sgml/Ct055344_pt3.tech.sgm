<HEAD>CHAP. LXXIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine arrives at the gari&s;on, where he re|ceives
the la&s;t admonitions of Commodore Trun|nion,
who next day re&s;igns his breath, and is
buried according to his own directions. Some
gentlemen in the country make a fruitle&s;s attempt
to accommodate matters betwixt Mr. Gamaliel
Pickle and his elde&s;t &s;on.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT four o'clock in the morning our
hero arrived at the gari&s;on, where he
found his generous uncle in extremity,
$apported in bed, by Julia on one &s;ide, and lieu|tenant
Hatchway on the other; while Mr. Jolter
admini&s;tered &s;piritual con&s;olation to his &s;oul, and
<PB N="2" REF="7">
between whiles comforted Mrs. Trunnion, who,
with her maid, &s;at by the fire, weeping with
great decorum; the phy&s;ician having ju&s;t taken
his la&s;t &s;ee, and retired, after pronouncing the
fatal progno&s;tic, in which he anxiou&s;ly wi&s;hed
he might not be mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>Though the commodore's &s;peech was inter|rupted
by a violent hiccup, he &s;till retained the
u&s;e of his &s;en&s;es; and when Peregrine approach|ed,
&s;tretched out his hand with manife&s;t &s;igns of
&s;atisfaction. The young gentleman, who&s;e heart
overflowed with gratitude and affection, could
not behold &s;uch a &s;pectacle, unmoved. He en|deavoured
to conceal his tenderne&s;s, which in
the wildne&s;s of his youth, and in the pride of
his di&s;po&s;ition, he con&s;idered as a derogation from
his manhood; but, in &s;pite of all his endeavours,
the tears gu&s;hed from his eyes, while he ki&s;&s;ed
the old man's hand; and he was &s;o utterly di&s;|concerted
by his grief, that when he attempted
to &s;peak, his tongue denied its office: &s;o that
the commodore, perceiving his di&s;order, made a
la&s;t effort of &s;trength, and con&s;oled him in the&s;e
words: &ldquo;Swab the &s;pray from your bow&s;prit,
my good lad, and coil up your &s;pirits. You mu&s;t
not let the top-li&s;ts of your heart give way, be|cau&s;e
you &s;ee me ready to go down at the&s;e years;
many a better man has foundered before he has
made half my way; tho&s; I tru&s;t, by the mercy
of God, I &s;hall be &s;ure in port in a very few
gla&s;&s;es, and fa&s;t moored in a mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed $$|ding:
for my good friend Jolter hath overhaul$$
the journal of my &s;ins; and by the ob&s;ervatio$$
he hath taken of the &s;tate of my &s;oul, I hope $
&s;hall happily conclude my voyage, and be brough
up in the latitude of heaven. Here has been a
<PB N="3" REF="8">
doctor that wanted to &s;tow me chock-full of phy|&s;ic;
but, when a man's hour is come, what &s;ig|nifies
his taking his departure with a 'pothecary's
&s;hop in his hold? Tho&s;e fellows come along
&s;ide of dying men, like the me&s;&s;engers of the ad|miralty
with &s;ailing orders: but, I told him as
how I could &s;lip my cable without his direction
or a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and &s;o he hauled off in dudgeon.
Th$s cur&s;ed hiccup (damnation &s;eize it) makes
&s;uch a rippling in the current of my &s;peech, that
mayhap you don't under&s;tand what I &s;ay. Now,
while the &s;ucker of my wind pump will go, I
would willingly mention a few things, which I
hope you will &s;et down in the log-book of your
remembrance, when I am &s;tiff, d'ye &s;ee. There's
your aunt &s;itting whimpering by the fire, I de&s;ire
you will keep her tight, warm, and ea&s;y in her
old age; &s;he's an hone&s;t heart in her own way,
and tho&s; &s;he goes a little crank and humour&s;om$$
by being often over-&s;towed with Nantz and re|ligion,
&s;he has been a faithful &s;hip-mate to me,
and I dare &s;ay never turned in with another man,
&s;ince we fir&s;t embarked in the &s;ame bottom.
Jack Hatchway, you know the trim of her as
well as e'er a man in England, and I believe &s;he
has a kindne&s;s for you; whereby, if you two
will grapple in the way of matrimony, when I
am gone, I do &s;uppo&s;e, that my god&s;on, for love
of me, will allow you to live in the gari&s;on all
the days of your life.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Peregrine a&s;&s;ured him, he would with plea|&s;ure
comply with any reque&s;t he &s;hould make, in
behalf of two per&s;ons whom he e&s;teemed &s;o
much; and the lieutenant, with a waggi&s;h &s;neer,
which even the gravity of the &s;ituation could not
prevent, thanked them both for their good will,
<PB N="4" REF="9">
telling the commodore, he was obliged to him
for his friend&s;hip, in &s;eeking to promote him to
the command of a ve&s;&s;el which he him&s;elf had
wore out in the &s;ervice: that notwith&s;tanding,
he &s;hould be content to take charge of her, tho'
he could not help being &s;hy of coming after &s;uch
an able navigator.</P>
<P>Trunnion, exhau&s;ted as he was, &s;miled at this
&s;ally, and a ter &s;ome pau&s;e, re&s;umed his admo|nitions
in this manner: &ldquo;I need not talk of
Pipes, becau&s;e I know you will do for him, without
my recommendation; the fellow has failed with
me in many a hard gale, and I'll warrant him as
&s;tout a &s;eaman as ever &s;et face to the weather:
but I hope you will take care of the re&s;t of my
crew, and not di&s;rate them after I am dead, in
favour of new followers. As for that young wo|man,
Ned Gauntlet's daughter, I am informed
as how &s;he is an excellent wench, and has a re|&s;pect
for you; whereby, if you run her on board
in an unlawful way, I leave my cur&s;e upon you,
and tru&s;t you will never pro&s;per in the voyage of
life: but, I believe you are more of an hone&s;t
man, than to behave &s;o much like a pitate. I
beg of all love, you wool take care of your con|&s;titution,
and beware of running &s;oul of harlots,
who are no better than &s;o many mermaids, that
&s;it upon rocks in the &s;ea, and hang out a fair
face for the de&s;truction of pa&s;&s;engers; tho&s; I mu&s;t
&s;ay, for my own part, I never met with any of
tho&s;e &s;weet &s;ingers, and yet I have gone to &s;ea
for the &s;pace of thirty years. But, how&s;omever,
&s;teer your cour&s;e clear of all &s;uch brim&s;tone
bitches; &s;hun going to law as you would &s;hun
the devil, and look upon all attornies as devour|ing
&s;harks, or ravenous fi&s;h of prey. As &s;oon
<PB N="5" REF="10">
as the breath is out of my body, let minute guns
be fired, till I am &s;afe under ground: I would
al&s;o be buried in the red jacket I had on, when
I boarded and took the <HI>Renummy.</HI> Let my pi|&s;tols,
cutla&s;s, and pocket-compa&s;s be laid in the
coffin along with me. Let me be carried to the
grave by my own men, dre&s;&s;ed in the black caps
and white &s;hirts which my barge's crew were
wont to wear; and they mu&s;t keep a good look|out,
that none of your pilfering rap&s;callions may
come and heave me up again, for the lucre of
what they can get, until my carca&s;e is belayed by
a tomb-&s;tone. As for the motto, or what you
call it, I leave that to you and Mr. Jolter, who
are &s;cholars; but I do de&s;ire, that it may not be
ingraved in the Greek or Latin lingos, and much
le&s;s in the French, which I abominate, but in
plain Engli&s;h, that when the angel comes to pipe
<HI>all hands</HI> at the great day, he may know that I
am a Briti&s;h man, and &s;peak to me in my mother
tongue. And now I have no more to &s;ay, but
God in heav$n have mercy upon my &s;oul, and
&s;end you all $word$ weather, where&s;oever you are
bound.&rdquo; So &s;aying, he regarded every indivi|dual
around him with a lock of complacency,
and clo&s;ing his eye, compo&s;ed him&s;elf to re&s;t,
while the whole audience (Pipes him&s;elf not ex|cepted)
were melted with &s;orrow; and Mrs.
Trunnion con&s;ented to quit the room, that &s;he
might not be expo&s;ed to the un&s;peakable angui&s;h
of &s;eeing him expire.</P>
<P>His la&s;t moments, however, were not &s;o near
as they imagined; he began to do&s;e, and enjoyed
&s;mall intervals of ea&s;e, till next day in the after|noon;
during which remi&s;&s;ions, he was heard
to pour forth many pious ejaculations, expre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="6" REF="11">
his hope, that, for all the heavy cargo of his &s;ins,
he &s;hould be able to &s;urmount the foothook|&s;hrouds
of de&s;pair, and get alo&s;t to the cro&s;s-trees
of God's good favour. At la&s;t, his voice &s;unk
&s;o low, as not to be di&s;tingui&s;hed; and having
lain about an hour, almo&s;t without any percep|tible
&s;igns of life, he gave up the gho&s;t, with a
groan which anounced his decea&s;e.</P>
<P>Julia was no &s;ooner certified of this melan|choly
event, than &s;he ran to her aunt's chamber,
weeping aloud; and immediately a very decent
concert was performed by the good widow and
her attendants. Peregrine and Hatchway re|tired
till the corp&s;e &s;hould be laid out; and Pipes
having &s;urveyed the body, with a face of rueful
attention, &ldquo;Well fare thy &s;oul! old Haw&s;er
Trunnion, (&s;aid he) man and boy I have known
thee the&s;e five and thirty years, and &s;ure a truer
heart never broke bi&s;cuit. Many a hard gale
ha&s;t thou weathered; but now thy &s;pells are all
over, and thy hull fairly laid up. A better com|mander
I'd never de&s;ire to &s;erve; and who knows
but I may help to &s;et up thy &s;tanding rigging in an|other
world?&rdquo;</P>
<P>All the &s;ervants of the hou&s;e were affected with
the lo&s;s of their old ma&s;ter, and the poor people
in the neighbourhood a&s;&s;embled at the gate, and
by repeated howlings expre&s;&s;ed their &s;orrow for
the death of their charitable benefactor. Pere|grine,
though he felt every thing which love and
gratitude could in&s;pire on this occa&s;ion, was not
&s;o much overwhelmed with affliction, as to be
incapable of taking the management of the fa|mily
into his own hands. He gave directions
about the funeral with great di&s;cretion, after
having paid the compliments of condolance to
<PB N="7" REF="12">
his aunt, whom he con&s;oled with the a&s;&s;urance
of his inviolable e&s;teem and affection. He or|dered
&s;uits of mourning to be made for every
per&s;on in the gari&s;on, and invited all the neigh|bouring
gentlemen to the burial, not even ex|cepting
his father and brother Gam, who did not,
however, honour the ceremony with their pre|&s;ence;
nor was his mother humane enough to
vi&s;it her &s;i&s;ter-in-law in her di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>In the method of interment, the commodore's
injunctions were obeyed to a tittle; and at the
&s;ame time our hero made a donation of fifty
pounds to the poor of the pari&s;h, as a benefac|tion
which his uncle had forgot to bequeath.</P>
<P>Having performed the&s;e ob&s;equies with the mo&s;t
pious punctuality, he examined the will, to
which there was no addition &s;ince it had been fir&s;t
executed, adju&s;ted the payment of all the legacies,
and being &s;ole executor, took an account of the
e&s;tate to which he had &s;ucceeded, and which,
after all deductions, amounted to thirty thou&s;and
pounds. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a fortune, of
which he was ab&s;olute ma&s;ter, did not at all con|tribute
to the humiliation of his &s;pirit, but in|&s;pired
him with new ideas of grandeur and mag|nificence,
and elevated his hope to the highe&s;t
pinnacle of expectation.</P>
<P>His dome&s;tic affairs being &s;ettled, he was vi|&s;ited
by almo&s;t all the gentlemen of the county,
who came to pay their compliments of congra|tulation,
on his acce&s;&s;ion to the e&s;tate; and &s;ome
of them offered their good offices towards a re|conciliation
betwixt his father and him, induced
by the general dete&s;tation which was entertained
for his brother Gam, who was by this time
looked upon by his neighbours as a prodigy of
<PB N="8" REF="13">
in&s;olence and malice. Our young &s;quire thanked
them for their kind propo&s;al, which he accepted;
and old Gamaliel, at their intreaties, &s;eemed
very well di&s;po&s;ed to an accommodation: but,
as he would not venture to declare him&s;elf, before
he had con&s;ulted his wife, that favourable di&s;po|&s;ition
was rendered altogether ineffectual, by the
in&s;tigations of that implacable woman; and our
hero re&s;igned all expectation of being reunited
to his father's hou&s;e. His brother, as u&s;ual, took
all opportunities of injuring his character, by
fal&s;e a&s;per&s;ions and &s;tories mi&s;repre&s;ented, in or|der
to prejudice his reputation: nor was his &s;i&s;ter
Julia &s;uffered to enjoy her good fortune in peace.
Had he undergone &s;uch per&s;ecution from an alien
to his blood, the world would have heard of his
revenge; but, notwith&s;tanding his indignation,
he was too much tinctured by the prejudices of
con&s;anguinity, to lift his arm in judgment again&s;t
the &s;on of his own parents; and this con&s;idera|tion
abridged the term of his re&s;idence at the ga|ri&s;on,
where he had propo&s;ed to &s;tay for &s;ome
months.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="80" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. LXXX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The young gentleman having &s;ettled his dome&s;tic af|fairs,
arrives in London, and &s;ets up a gay
equipage. He me$ts with Emilia, and is in|troduced
to her uncle.</HEAD>
<P>HIS aunt, at the earne&s;t &s;olicitation of Julia
and her hu&s;band, took up her quarters at
the hou&s;e of that affectionate kin&s;woman, who
made it her chief &s;tudy to comfort and cheri&s;h
the di&s;con&s;olate widow; and Jolter, in expecta|tion
<PB N="9" REF="14">
of the living, which was not yet vacant, re|mained
in gari&s;on, in quality of land-&s;teward
upon our hero's country-e&s;tate. As for the lieu|tenant,
our young gentleman communed with
him, in a &s;erious manner, about the commo|dore's
propo&s;al of his taking Mrs. Trunnion to
wife; and Jack, being quite tired of the &s;olitary
&s;ituation of a batchelor, which nothing but the
company of his old commander could have en|abled
him to &s;upport &s;o long, far from di&s;cover|ing
aver&s;ion to the match, ob&s;erved with an arch
&s;mile, that it was not the fir&s;t time he had com|manded
a ve&s;&s;el in the ab&s;ence of Captain Trun|nion;
and therefore, if the widow was willing,
he would chearfully &s;tand by her helm, and, as
he hoped the duty would not be of long conti|nuance,
do his endeavour to &s;teer her &s;afe into
the port, where the commodore might come on
board, and take charge of her again.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this declaration, it was de|termined
that Mr. Hatchway &s;hould make his
addre&s;&s;es to Mrs. Trunnion, as &s;oon as decency
would permit her to receive them; and Mr. Clo|ver
and his wife promi&s;ed to exert their influence
in his behalf. Mean while, Jack was de&s;ired to
live at the ca&s;tle as u&s;ual, and a&s;&s;ured, that it
&s;hould be put wholly in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as &s;oon as
he &s;hould be able to accompli&s;h this matrimonial
&s;cheme.</P>
<P>When Peregrine had &s;ettled all the&s;e points to
his own &s;atisfaction, he took leave of all his
friends, and repairing to the great city, purcha&s;ed
a new chariot and hor&s;es, put Pipes and another
lacquey into rich liveries, took elegant lodgings
in Pall-mall, and made a mo&s;t remarkable ap|pearance
among people of fa&s;hion. It was owing
<PB N="10" REF="15">
to this equipage, and the gaiety of his per&s;onal
deportment, that common fame, which is al|ways
a common liar, repre&s;ented him as a young
gentleman who had ju&s;t &s;ucceeded to an e&s;tate of
five thou&s;and pounds <HI>per annum,</HI> by the death of
an uncle; that he was intitled to an equal fortune
at the decea&s;e of his own father, exclu&s;ive of
two con&s;iderable jointure$, which would devolve
upon him, at the demi&s;e of his mother and aunt.
This report (fal&s;e and ridiculous as it was) he
could not find in his heart to contradict; not but
that he was &s;orry to find him&s;elf &s;o mi&s;repre|&s;ented:
but his vanity would not allow him to
take any &s;tep that might dimini&s;h his importance
in the opinion of tho&s;e who courted his ac|quaintance,
on the &s;uppo&s;ition that his circum|&s;tances
were actually as affluent as they were &s;aid
to be. Nay, &s;o much was he infatuated by this
weakne&s;s, that he re&s;olved to encourage the de|ception,
by living up to the report; and ac|cordingly,
engaged in the mo&s;t expen&s;ive parties
of plea&s;ure; believing, that before his pre&s;ent
finances &s;hould be exhau&s;ted, his fortune would
be effectually made, by the per&s;onal accompli&s;h|ments
he &s;hould have occa&s;ion to di&s;play to the
beau monde, in the cour&s;e of his extravagance.
In a word, vanity and pride were the ruling foibles
of our adventurer, who imagined him&s;elf &s;uffi|ciently
qualified to retrieve his fortune in various
&s;hapes, long before he could have any idea of
want or difficulty. He thought he &s;hould have
it in his power, at any time, to make prize of a
rich heire&s;s, or opulent widow; his ambition had
already a&s;pired to the heart of a young hand&s;ome
duche&s;s dowager, to who&s;e acquaintance he had
found means to be introduced: or, &s;hould matri|mony
<PB N="11" REF="16">
chance to be un&s;uitable to his inclinations,
he never doubted, that by the intere&s;t he might
acquire among the nobility, he &s;hould be favoured
with &s;ome lucrative po&s;t, that would amply re|compen&s;e
him for the liberality of his di&s;po&s;ition.
There are many young men, who entertain the
&s;ame expectations, with half the rea&s;on he had to
be &s;o pre&s;umptuous.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e chimerical calculations,
his pa&s;&s;ion for Emilia did not &s;ub&s;ide; but, on
the contrary, began to rage to &s;uch an inflam|mation
of de&s;ire, that her idea interfered with
every other reflection, and ab&s;olutely di&s;abled him
from pro&s;ecuting the other lofty &s;chemes which
his imagination had projected. He therefore laid
down the hone&s;t re&s;olution of vi&s;iting her in all the
&s;plendor of his &s;ituation, in order to practi&s;e upon
her virtue with all his art and addre&s;s, to the ut|mo&s;t
extent of his influence and fortune. Nay,
&s;o effectually had his guilty pa&s;&s;ion ab&s;orb'd his
principles of honour, con&s;cience, humanity, and
regard for the commodore's la&s;t words, that he
was ba&s;e enough to rejoice at the ab&s;ence of his
friend Godfrey, who being then with his regi|ment
in Ireland, could not dive into his purpo&s;e,
or take mea&s;ures for fru&s;trating his vicious
de&s;ign.</P>
<P>Fraught with the&s;e heroic &s;entiments, he de|termined
to &s;et out for Su&s;&s;ex in his chariot and
&s;ix, attended by his valet de chambre and two
footmen; and as he was now &s;en&s;ible, that in his
la&s;t e&s;&s;ay he had mi&s;taken his cue, he determined
to change his battery, and &s;ap the fortre&s;s, by
the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, &s;oft, and in&s;inuating beha|viour.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="17">
On the evening that preceded this purpo&s;ed
expedition, he went into one of the boxes at the
play-hou&s;e, as u&s;ual, to &s;hew him&s;elf to the la|dies;
and in reconnoitring the company through
a gla&s;s, (for no other rea&s;on, but becau&s;e it was
fa&s;hionable to be purblind) perceived his mi&s;tre&s;s
very plainly dre&s;&s;ed, in one of the &s;eats above the
&s;tage, talking to another young woman of a very
homely appearance. Though his heart beat the
alarm with the utmo&s;t impatience at &s;ight of his
Emilia, he was for &s;ome minutes deterred from
obeying the impul&s;e of his love, by the pre&s;ence
of &s;ome ladies of fa&s;hion, who, he feared, would
think the wor&s;e of him, &s;hould they &s;ee him
make his compliments in public to a per&s;on of
her figure. Nor would the violence of his incli|nation
have &s;o far prevailed over his pride, as to
lead him thither, had not he recollected, that his
quality-friends would look upon her as &s;ome hand|&s;ome
Abigail, with whom he had an affair of gal|lantry,
and of con&s;equence gave him credit for
the intrigue.</P>
<P>Encouraged by this &s;ugge&s;tion, he complied
with the dictates of love, and &s;lew to the place
where his charmer &s;at. His air and dre&s;s were
&s;o remarkable, that it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible he
&s;hould have e&s;caped the eyes of a curious ob|&s;erver,
e&s;pecially as he had cho&s;en a time for
coming in, when his entrance could not fail to
attract the notice of the &s;pectators; I mean, when
the whole hou&s;e was hu&s;hed in attention to the
performance on the &s;tage. Emilia, therefore,
had perceived him at his fir&s;t approach; &s;he found
her&s;elf di&s;covered by the direction of his gla&s;s,
and gue&s;&s;ing his intention by his abrupt retreat
from the box, &s;ummoned all her fortitude to her
<PB N="13" REF="18">
aid, and prepared for his reception. He advanced
to her with an air of eagerne&s;s and joy, tempered
with mode&s;ty and re&s;pect, and expre&s;&s;ed his &s;a|tisfaction
at &s;eeing her, with a &s;eeming reverence
of regard. Though &s;he was extremely well plea&s;ed
at this unexpected behaviour, &s;he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the
emotions of her heart, and an&s;wered his compli|ments
with affected ea&s;e and unconcern, &s;uch as
might denote the good humour of a per&s;on who
meets by accident with an indifferent acquaint|ance.
After having certified him&s;elf of her own
good health, he very kindly inquired about her
mother and Mi&s;s Sophy, gave her to under&s;tand,
that he had lately been favoured with a letter
from Godfrey, and that he had actually intended
to &s;et out next morning on a vi&s;it to Mrs. Gaunt|let,
which (now that he was &s;o happy as to meet
with her) he would po&s;tpone, until he &s;hould
have the plea&s;ure of attending her to the coun|try.
After having thanked him for his polite in|tention,
&s;he told him, that her mother was ex|pected
in town in a few days, and that &s;he her|&s;elf
had come to London &s;ome weeks ago, to
give her attendance upon her aunt, who had
been dangerou&s;ly ill, but was now pretty well
recovered.</P>
<P>Although the conver&s;ation of cour&s;e turned
upon general topics, during the entertainment,
he took all opportunities of being particular with
his eyes, through which he conveyed a thou&s;and
tender prote&s;tations. She &s;aw, and inwardly re|joiced
at the humility of his looks; but, far from
rewarding it with one approving glance, &s;he in|du&s;triou&s;ly
avoided this ocular intercour&s;e, and
rather coquetted with a young gentleman that
ogled her from the oppo&s;ite box. Peregrine's
<PB N="14" REF="19">
penetration ea&s;ily detected her &s;entiments, and
he was nettled at her di&s;&s;imulation, which &s;erv|ed
to confirm him in his unwarrantable de&s;igns
upon her per&s;on. He per&s;i&s;ted in his a&s;&s;iduities
with indefatigable per&s;everance; when the play
was concluded, handed her and her companion to
an hackney-coach, and with difficulty was per|mitted
to e&s;cort them to the hou&s;e of Emilia's
uncle, to whom our hero was introduced by the
young lady, as an intimate friend of her brother
Godfrey.</P>
<P>The old gentleman, who was no &s;tranger to
the nature of Peregrine's connexion with his
&s;i&s;ter's family, prevailed upon him to &s;tay &s;upper,
and &s;eemed particularly well plea&s;ed with his con|ver&s;ation
and deportment, which, by help of his
natural &s;agacity, he wonderfully adapted to the
humour of his entertainer. After &s;upper, when
the ladies were withdrawn, and the citizen called
for his pipe, our &s;ly adventurer followed his ex|ample;
and though he abhorred the plant, &s;moak|ed
with an air of infinite &s;atisfaction, and expa|tiated
upon the virtues of tobacco, as if he had
been deeply concerned in the Virginia trade. In
the progre&s;s of the di&s;cour&s;e, he con&s;ulted the
merchant's di&s;po&s;ition; and the national debt
coming upon the carpet, held forth upon the
funds like a profe&s;&s;ed broker. When the alder|man
complained of the re&s;trictions and di&s;cou|ragement
of trade, his gue&s;t inveighed again&s;t
exorbitant duties, with the nature of which he
&s;eemed as well acquainted as any commi&s;&s;ioner
of the cu&s;toms; &s;o that the uncle was a&s;toni&s;hed
at the extent of his knowledge, and expre&s;&s;ed
his &s;urprize, that a gay young gentleman, like
him, &s;hould have found either lei&s;ure or inclina|tion
<PB N="15" REF="20">
to con&s;ider &s;ubjects &s;o foreign to the fa&s;hion|able
amu&s;ements of youth.</P>
<P>Pickle laid hold on this opportunity to tell
him, that he was de&s;cended from a race of mer|chants;
and that, early in life, he had made it
his bu&s;ine&s;s to in&s;truct him&s;elf in the different
branches of trade, which he not only &s;tudied as
his family-profe&s;&s;ion, but al&s;o as the &s;ource of
all our national riches and power. He then
launched out in prai&s;e of commerce, and the pro|moters
thereof; and, by way of contra&s;t, em|ployed
all his ridicule, in drawing &s;uch ludicrous
pictures of the manners and education of what is
called high life, that the trader's &s;ides were &s;haken
by laughter, even to the danger of his life; and
he looked upon our adventurer as a miracle of
&s;obriety and good &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Having thus ingratiated him&s;elf with the uncle,
Peregrine took his leave, and next day in the
forenoon vi&s;ited the niece in his chariot, after
&s;he had been admoni&s;hed by her kin&s;man to be|have
with circum&s;pection, and cautioned again&s;t
neglecting or di&s;couraging the addre&s;&s;es of &s;uch a
valuable admirer.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LXXXI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He pro&s;ecutes his de&s;ign upon Emilia with great art
and per&s;everance.</HEAD>
<P>OUR adventurer, having by his hypocri&s;y
obtained free acce&s;s to his mi&s;tre&s;s, began
the &s;iege, by profe&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t &s;incere contri|tion
for his former levity, and imploring her for|givene&s;s
with &s;uch earne&s;t &s;upplication, that,
<PB N="16" REF="21">
guarded as &s;he was again&s;t his flattering arts, &s;he
began to believe his prote&s;tations, which were
even accompanied with tears, and abated a good
deal of that &s;everity and di&s;tance &s;he had pro|po&s;ed
to maintain, during this interview. She
would not, however, favour him with the lea&s;t
acknowledgment of a mutual pa&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e, in
the mid&s;t of his vows of eternal con&s;tancy and
truth, he did not mention one &s;yllable of wed|lock,
though he was now intirely ma&s;ter of his
own conduct; and this con&s;ideration created a
doubt, which fortified her again&s;t all his attacks:
yet, what her di&s;cretion would have concealed,
was di&s;covered by her eyes, which, in &s;pite of all
her endeavours, breathed forth complacency and
love. For, her inclination was flattered by her
own &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, which imputed her admirer's
&s;ilence, in that particular, to the hurry and per|turbation
of his &s;pirits, and per&s;uaded her, that
he could not po&s;&s;ibly regard her with any other
than honourable intentions.</P>
<P>The in&s;idious lover exulted in the tenderne&s;s
of her looks, from which he pre&s;aged a compleat
victory: but, that he might not over-&s;hoot him|&s;elf
by his own precipitation, he would not run
the ri&s;k of declaring him&s;elf, until her heart
&s;hould be &s;o far entangled within his &s;nares, as
that neither the &s;ugge&s;tions of honour, prudence,
or pride &s;hould be able to di&s;engage it. Armed
with this re&s;olution, he re&s;trained the impatience
of his temper within the limits of the mo&s;t deli|cate
deportment; and after having &s;olicited and
obtained permi&s;&s;ion to attend her to the next
opera, took her by the hand, and pre&s;&s;ing it to
his lips in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful manner, went
away, leaving her in a mo&s;t whim&s;ical &s;tate of
<PB N="17" REF="22">
&s;u&s;pence, checquered with an intere&s;ting vici&s;&s;i|tude
of hope and fear.</P>
<P>On the appointed day, he appeared again about
five o'clock in the afternoon, and found her na|tive
charms &s;o much improved by the advantages
of dre&s;s, that he was tran&s;ported with admiration
and delight; and while he conducted her to the
Hay market, could &s;carce bridle the impetuo&s;ity
of his pa&s;&s;ion, &s;o as to ob&s;erve the forbearing
maxims he had adopted. When &s;he entered the
pit, he had abundance of food for the gratifica|tion
of his vanity; for, in a moment, &s;he eclip&s;ed
all the female part of the audience, each indi|vidual
allowing in her own heart, that the &s;tranger
was by far the hand&s;ome&s;t woman there pre&s;ent,
except her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Here it was that our hero enjoyed a double
triumph; he was vain of this opportunity to en|hance
his reputation for gallantry among the la|dies
of fa&s;hion, who knew him, and proud of
an occa&s;ion to di&s;play his quality-acquaintance to
Emilia, that &s;he might entertain the greater idea
of the conque&s;t &s;he had made, and pay the more
deference to his importance in the &s;equel of his
addre&s;&s;es. That he might profit as much as po&s;|&s;ible
by this &s;ituation, he went up and acco&s;ted
every per&s;on in the pit, with whom he ever had
the lea&s;t communication, whi&s;pered and laughed
with an affected air of familiarity, and even
bowed at a di&s;tance to &s;ome of the nobility, on
the &s;lender foundation of having &s;tood near them
at court, or pre&s;ented them with a pinch of Rap|pee
at White's chocolate-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This ridiculous o&s;tentation, though now pract|ised
with a view of promoting his de&s;ign, was
a weakne&s;s that, in &s;ome degree, infected the
<PB N="18" REF="23">
whole of his behaviour; for nothing gave him
&s;o much joy in conver&s;ation, as an opportunity
of giving the company to under&s;tand, how
well he was with per&s;ons of di&s;tingui&s;hed rank
and character: he would often (for example)
ob&s;erve, as it were occa&s;ionally, that the duke
of G&mdash;was one of the be&s;t natured men in
the world, and illu&s;trate his a&s;&s;ertion by &s;ome in|&s;tance
of his affability, in which he him&s;elf was
concerned: then, by an abrupt tran&s;ition, he
would repeat &s;ome repartee of lady T&mdash;, and
mention a certain <HI>bon mot</HI> of the earl of C&mdash;,
which was uttered in his hearing.</P>
<P>Abundance of young men, in this manner,
make free with the names, though they have never
had acce&s;s to the per&s;ons of the nobility: but,
this was not the ca&s;e with Peregrine, who, in
con&s;ideration of his appearance and &s;uppo&s;ed for|tune,
together with the advantage of his intro|duction,
was by this time freely admitted to the
tables of the great.</P>
<P>In his return with Emilia from the opera,
though he &s;till maintained the mo&s;t &s;crupulous
decorum in his behaviour, he plied her with the
mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate expre&s;&s;ions of love, &s;queezed her
hand with great &s;ervency, prote&s;ted that his whole
&s;oul was ingro&s;&s;ed by her idea, and that he could
not exi&s;t independent of her favour. Plea&s;ed as
&s;he was with his warm and pathetic addre&s;&s;es, to|gether
with the re&s;pectful manner of his making
love, &s;he yet had prudence and re&s;olution &s;uffi|cient
to contain her tenderne&s;s, which was ready
to run over; being fortified again&s;t his arts, by
reflecting, that if his aim was honourable, it was
now his bu&s;ine&s;s to declare it. On this con&s;ide|ration,
&s;he refu&s;ed to make any &s;erious reply to
<PB N="19" REF="24">
his earne&s;t expo&s;tulations, but affected to receive
them as the undetermined effu&s;ions of gallantry
and good breeding.</P>
<P>This fictitious gaiety and good humour, though
it baffled his hope of extorting from her an ac|knowledgment
of which he might have taken
immediate advantage, neverthele&s;s encouraged
him to ob&s;erve, (as the chariot pa&s;&s;ed along the
Strand) that the night was far advanced; that
&s;upper would certainly be over, before they could
reach her uncle's hou&s;e; and to propo&s;e, that he
&s;hould wait upon her to &s;ome place, where they
might be accommodated with a flight refre&s;hment.
She was offended at the freedom of this propo&s;al,
which, however, &s;he treated as a joke, thank|ing
him for his courteous offer, and a&s;&s;uring him,
that when &s;he &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed for a tavern-treat,
he alone &s;hould have the opportunity of be&s;tow|ing
it.</P>
<P>Her kin&s;man being engaged with company abroad,
and her aunt retired to re&s;t, he had the good for|tune
to enjoy a <HI>t&eacute;te a t&ocirc;te</HI> with her during a whole
hour, which he employed with &s;uch con&s;ummate
&s;kill, that her caution was almo&s;t overcome. He
not only affailed her with the artillery of &s;ighs,
vows, prayers and tears, but even pawned his
honour in behalf of his love. He &s;wore with
many imprecations, that although her heart were
&s;urrendered to him at di&s;cretion, there was a
principle within him, which would never allow
him to injure &s;uch innocence and beauty; and
the tran&s;ports of his pa&s;&s;ion had, upon this occa|&s;ion,
&s;o far over&s;hot his purpo&s;e, that if &s;he had
demanded an explanation, while he was thus agi|tated,
he would have engaged him&s;elf to her
wi&s;h by &s;uch ties, as he could not po&s;&s;ibly break,
<PB N="20" REF="25">
with any regard to his reputation. But, from
&s;uch expo&s;tulation, &s;he was deterred partly by
pride, and partly by the dread of finding her&s;elf
mi&s;taken in &s;uch an intere&s;ting conjecture. She
therefore enjoyed the pre&s;ent flattering appearance
of her fate, was prevailed upon to accept the
jewels which he had purcha&s;ed with part of his
winning at Bath, and with the mo&s;t inchanting
conde&s;cen&s;ion &s;ubmitted to a warm embrace,
when he took his leave, after having obtained
permi&s;&s;ion to vi&s;it her, as often as his inclination
and convenience would permit.</P>
<P>In his return to his own lodgings, he was
buoyed up with his &s;ucce&s;s to an extravagance
of hope, already congratulated him&s;elf upon his
triumph over Emilia's virtue, and began to pro|ject
future conque&s;ts among the mo&s;t dignified
characters of the female &s;ex. But his attention
was not at all di&s;&s;ipated by the&s;e vain reflections;
he re&s;olved to concentrate the whole exertion of
his &s;oul upon the execution of his pre&s;ent plan,
de&s;i&s;ted, in the mean time, from all other &s;chemes
of plea&s;ure, intere&s;t and ambition, and took
lodgings in the city, for the more commodious
accompli&s;hment of his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>While our lover's imagination was thus agree|ably
regaled, his mi&s;tre&s;s did not enjoy her ex|pectations,
without the intervention of doubts
and anxiety. His &s;ilence touching the final aim
of his addre&s;&s;es was a my&s;tery on which &s;he was
afraid of exerci&s;ing her &s;agacity; and her uncle
tormented her with inquiries into the circum|&s;tances
of Peregrine's profe&s;&s;ions and deportment.
Rather than give this relation the lea&s;t cau&s;e of
&s;u&s;picion, which mu&s;t have cut off all intercour&s;e
betwixt her and her admirer, &s;he &s;aid every thing
<PB N="21" REF="26">
which &s;he thought would &s;atisfy his care and con|cern
for her welfare; and in con&s;equence of &s;uch
repre&s;entation, &s;he enjoyed, without re&s;erve, the

the whole &s;cene di&s;played at once, to the admi|ration
of Emilia, who&s;e expectation was infi|nitely
&s;urpa&s;&s;ed by this exhibition. Our gallant
having conducted her through all the different
apartments, and de&s;cribed the oeconomy of the
place, led her into the circle, and, in their turn,
they danced &s;everal minuets; then going to the &s;ide|board,
he prevailed upon her to eat &s;ome &s;weet-meets
and drink a gla&s;s of Champagne; and,
after a &s;econd review of the company, they en|gaged
in country-dances, at which exerci&s;e they
continued, until our adventurer concluded, that
his partner's blood was &s;ufficiently warmed for
the pro&s;ecution of his de&s;ign. On this &s;uppo&s;i|tion,
which was built upon her declaring, that
&s;he was thir&s;ty and fatigued, he per&s;uaded her to
take a little refre&s;hment and repo&s;e; and for that
purpo&s;e, handed her down &s;tairs into the eating-room,
where having &s;eated her on the floor, he
pre&s;ented her with a gla&s;s of wine and water;
and as &s;he complained of being faint, enriched
the draught with &s;ome drops of a certain elixir,
which he recommended as a mo&s;t excellent re|&s;torative,
though it was no other than a &s;timu|lating
tincture, which he had treacherou&s;ly pro|vided
for the occa&s;ion. Having &s;wallowed this
potion, by which her &s;pirits were manife&s;tly ex|hilerated,
&s;he ate a &s;lice of $am with the wing of
a cold pullet, and concluded the meal with a
gla&s;s of Burgundy, which &s;he drank at the earne&s;t
intreaty of her admirer. The&s;e extraordinary
cordials co-operating with the ferment of her
blood, which was heated by violent motion,
could not fail to affect the con&s;titution of a deli|cate
young creature, who was naturally &s;prightly
and volatile. Her eyes began to &s;parkle with un|u&s;ual
<PB N="24" REF="29">
fire and vivacity, a thou&s;and brilliant &s;allies
of wit e&s;caped her, and every ma&s;k that acco&s;ted
her, underwent &s;ome &s;marting repartee.</P>
<P>Peregrine, overjoyed at the &s;ucce&s;s of his ad|mini&s;tration,
propo&s;ed that they &s;hould re&s;ume
their places at the country-dances, with a view
to promote and a&s;&s;i&s;t the efficacy of his elixir;
and when he thought her di&s;po&s;ition was properly
adapted for the theme, began to ply her with all
the elocution of love. In order to elevate his
own &s;pirits to that pitch of re&s;olution which his
&s;cheme required, he drank two whole bottles of
Burgundy, which inflamed his pa&s;&s;ion to &s;uch a
degree, that he found him&s;elf capable of under|taking
and perpetrating any &s;cheme for the grati|fication
of his de&s;ire.</P>
<P>Emilia, warmed by &s;o many concurring in|centives,
in &s;avour of the man &s;he loved, abated
con&s;iderably of her wonted re&s;erve, li&s;tened to
his prote&s;tations with undi&s;&s;embled plea&s;ure, and
in the confidence of her &s;atisfaction, even owned
him ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of her affections. Ravi&s;hed
with this confe&s;&s;ion, he now deemed him&s;elf on
the brink of reaping the delicious fruits of his art
and a&s;&s;iduity; and the morning being already
pretty far advanced, a&s;&s;ented with rapture to the
fir&s;t propo&s;al &s;he made of retiring to her lodgings.
The blinds of the chariot being pulled up, he
took advantage of the favourable &s;ituation of her
thoughts; and on pretence of being whim&s;ical,
in con&s;equence of the wine he had &s;wallowed,
cla&s;ped her in his arms, and imprinted a thou|&s;and
ki&s;&s;es on her pouting lips, a freedom which
the pardoned as the privilege of intoxication.
While he thus indulged him&s;elf with impunity,
the carriage halted, and Pipes opening the door,
<PB N="25" REF="30">
his ma&s;ter handed her into the pa&s;&s;age, before &s;he
perceived that it was not her uncle's hou&s;e, at
which they had alighted.</P>
<P>Alarmed at this di&s;covery, &s;he with &s;ome con|fu&s;ion
de&s;ired to know his rea&s;on for conducting
her to a &s;trange place at the&s;e hours: but he
made no reply, until he had led her into an apart|ment,
when he gave her to under&s;tand, that as
her uncle's family mu&s;t be di&s;turbed by her going
thither &s;o late in the night, and the &s;treets near
Temple-bar were infe&s;ted by a multitude of rob|bers
and cut-throats, he had ordered his coach|man
to halt at this hou&s;e, which was kept by a
relation of his, a mighty good &s;ort of a gentle|woman,
who was proud of an opportunity to
accommodate a per&s;on for whom he was known
to entertain &s;uch tenderne&s;s and e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Emilia had too much penetration to be im|po&s;ed
upon by this plau&s;ible pretext: in &s;pite of
her partiality for Peregrine, which had never been
inflamed to &s;uch a pitch of complacency before,
&s;he comprehended his whole plan in a twinkling;
and though her blood boiled with indignation,
thanked him, with an affected air of &s;erenity, for
his kind concern, and expre&s;&s;ed her obligation to
his cou&s;in; but, at the &s;ame time, in&s;i&s;ted upon
going home, le&s;t her ab&s;ence &s;hould terrify her
uncle and aunt, who &s;he knew would not retire
to re&s;t, till her return.</P>
<P>He urged her, with a thou&s;and remon&s;trances,
to con&s;ult her own ea&s;e and &s;afety, promi&s;ing to
&s;end Pipes into the city, for the &s;atisfaction of her
relations: but finding her ob&s;tinately deaf to his
intreaties, he a&s;&s;ured her, that he would in a few
minutes comply with her reque&s;t; and, in the
mean time, begg'd &s;he would fortify her&s;elf again&s;t
<PB N="26" REF="31">
the cold with a cordial, which he poured out in
her pre&s;ence, and which (now that her &s;u&s;pi|cion
was arou&s;ed) &s;he refu&s;ed to ta&s;te, notwith|&s;tanding
all his importunities. He then fell upon
his knees before her, and the tears gu&s;hing from his
eyes, &s;wore that his pa&s;&s;ion was wound up to &s;uch
a pitch of impatience, that he could no longer live
upon the un&s;ub&s;tantial food of expectation; and
that, if &s;he would not vouch&s;afe to crown his happi|ne&s;s,
he would forthwith &s;acrifice him&s;elf to her di&s;|dain.
Such an abrupt addre&s;s, accompanied with
all the &s;ymptoms of frantic agitation, could not
fail to perplex and affright the gentle Emilia,
who, after &s;ome recollection, replied with a re|&s;olute
tone, that &s;he could not &s;ee what rea&s;on
he had to complain of her re&s;erve, which &s;he was
not at liberty to lay intirely a&s;ide, until he &s;hould
have avowed his intentions in form, and ob|tained
the &s;anction of tho&s;e whom it was her duty
to obey. &ldquo;Divine creature! (cried he, &s;eizing
her hand, and pre&s;&s;ing it to his lips) it is from
you alone I hope for that conde&s;cen&s;ion, which
would overwhelm me with tran&s;ports of cele&s;tial
bli&s;s. The &s;entiments of parents are &s;ordid, &s;illy,
and confined; &s;eek not then to &s;ubject my pa&s;|&s;ion
to &s;uch low re&s;trictions as were calculated
for the purpo&s;es of common life. My love is too
delicate and refined, to wear tho&s;e vulgar &s;etters,
which &s;erve only to de&s;troy the merit of volun|tary
affection, and to upbraid a man ince&s;&s;antly
with the articles of compul&s;ion, under which he
lies. My dear angel! &s;pare me the mortification
of being compelled to love you, and reign &s;ole
empre&s;s of my heart and fortune. I will not af|front
you &s;o much as to talk of &s;ettlements; my
<PB N="27" REF="32">
all is at your di&s;po&s;al. In this pocket-pook are
notes to the amount of two thou&s;and pounds;
do me the plea&s;ure to accept of them; to-morrow
I will lay ten thou&s;and more in your lap. In
a word, you &s;hall be mi&s;tre&s;s of my whole e&s;tate,
and I &s;hall think my&s;elf happy in living dependent
on your bounty!&rdquo;</P>
<P>Heavens! what were the emotions of the vir|tuous,
the &s;en&s;ible, the delicate, the tender Emi|lia's
heart, when &s;he heard this in&s;olent declara|tion
from the mouth of a man, whom &s;he had
honoured with her affection and e&s;teem! It was
not &s;imply horror, grief, or indignation that &s;he
felt, in con&s;equence of this unworthy treatment,
but the united pangs of all together, which pro|duced
a &s;ort of hy&s;teric laugh, while &s;he told
him, that &s;he could not help admiring his gene|ro&s;ity.</P>
<P>Deceived by this convul&s;ion, and the ironical
compliment that attended it, the lover thought
he had already made great progre&s;s in his opera|tions,
and that it was now his bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;torm
the fort by a vigorous a&s;&s;ault, that he might &s;pare
her the confu&s;ion of yielding without re&s;i&s;tance.
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by this vain &s;ugge&s;tion, he &s;tarted up,
and folding her in his arms, began to obey the
furious dictates of his unruly and ungenerous de|fire;
upon which, with an air of cool determi|nation,
&s;he demanded a parley; and when, upon
her repeated reque&s;t, he granted it, addre&s;&s;ed her|&s;elf
to him in the&s;e words, while her eyes gleam|ed
with all the dignity of the mo&s;t awful re&s;ent|ment.
&ldquo;Sir, I &s;corn to upbraid you with a re|petition
of your former vows and prote&s;tations,
nor will I recapitulate the little arts you have
practi&s;ed to en&s;nare my heart; becau&s;e, though
<PB N="28" REF="33">
by dint of the mo&s;t per&s;idious di&s;&s;imulation, you
have found means to deceive my opinion, your
utmo&s;t efforts have never been able to lull the vi|gilance
of my conduct, or to engage my affec|tion
beyond the power of di&s;carding you without
a tear, whenever my honour &s;hould demand &s;uch
a &s;acrifice. Sir, you are unworthy of my con|cern
or regret, and the &s;igh that now &s;truggles
from my brea&s;t, is the re&s;ult of &s;orrow, for my
own want of di&s;cernment. As for your pre&s;ent
attempt upon my cha&s;tity, I de&s;pi&s;e your power,
as I dete&s;t your intention. Though, under the
ma&s;k of the mo&s;t delecate re&s;pect, you have de|coyed
me from the immediate protection of my
friends, and contrived other impious &s;tratagems
to ruin my peace and reputation, I con&s;ide too
much in my own innocence, and the authority
of the law, to admit one thought of fear, much
le&s;s to &s;ink under the horror of this &s;hocking &s;i|tuation,
into which I have been &s;educed. Sir,
your behaviour on this occa&s;ion, is in all re&s;pects
low and contemptible: for, ruffian as you are,
you dur&s;t not harbour one thought of executing
your execrable &s;cheme, while you knew my bro|ther
was near enough to prevent, or revenge the
in&s;ult; &s;o that you mu&s;t not only be a treacherous
villain, but al&s;o a mo&s;t de&s;picable coward.&rdquo;
Having expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf in th$$ manner, with a
mo&s;t maje&s;tic &s;everity of a&s;pect, &s;he opened the
door, and walked down &s;tairs with &s;urpri&s;ing re|&s;olution,
committed her&s;elf to the care of a
watchman, who accommodated her with a hack|ney-chair,
in which &s;he was &s;a&s;ely conveyed to
her uncle's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mean while, the lover was &s;o confounded and
$ver-awed, by the&s;e cutting reproaches, and her
<PB N="29" REF="34">
animated behaviour, that all his re&s;olution for|&s;ook
him, and he found him&s;elf not only inca|pable
of ob&s;tructing her retreat, but even of ut|tering
one &s;yllable to deprecate her wrath, or ex|tenuate
the guilt of his own conduct. The na|ture
of his di&s;appointment, and the keen remor&s;e
that &s;eized him, when he reflected upon the di&s;|honourable
predicament in which his character
&s;tood with Emilia, rai&s;ed &s;uch perturbation in
his mind, that his &s;ilence was &s;ucceeded by a vio|lent
fit of di&s;traction, during which he raved like
a Bedlamite, and acted a thou&s;and extravagancies,
which convinced the people of the hou&s;e, (a cer|tain
bagnio) that he had actually lo&s;t his wits.
Pipes, with great concern, adopted the &s;ame opi|nion;
and, being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the waiters, hin|dered
him, by main force, from running out and
pur&s;uing the fair fugitive, whom, in his delirium,
he alternately cur&s;ed and commended, with hor|rid
imprecations, and lavi&s;h applau&s;e. His faith|ful
valet, having waited two whole hours, in hope
of &s;eeing this gu&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion overblown, and per|ceiving
that the paroxy&s;m &s;eemed rather to in|crea&s;e,
very prudently &s;ent for a phy&s;ician of his
ma&s;ter's acquaintance, who having con&s;idered the
circum&s;tances and &s;ymptoms of the di&s;order, di|rected,
that he &s;hould be plentifully blooded,
without lo&s;s of time, and pre&s;cribed a draught to
compo&s;e the tumult of his &s;pirits. The&s;e orders
being punctually performed, he grew more calm
and tractable, recovered his reflection &s;o far, as
to be a&s;hamed of the exta&s;y he had undergone,
&s;uffered him&s;elf quietly to be undre&s;&s;ed, and put
to bed, where the fatigue occa&s;ioned by his exer|ci&s;e
at the ma&s;querade, co-operated with the pre|&s;ent
di&s;&s;ipation of his &s;pirits to lull him in a pro|found

found &s;leep, which greatly tended to the pre&s;er|vation
of his intellects: not that he found him|&s;elf
in a &s;tate of perfect tranquillity, when he
waked about noon; the remembrance of what
had pa&s;&s;ed overwhelmed him with mortification.
Emilia's invectives &s;till &s;ounded in his ears; and
while he deeply re&s;ented her di&s;dain, he could
not help admiring her &s;pirit, and in his heart did
homage to her charms.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He endeavours to reconcile him&s;elf to his mi&s;tre&s;s,

<P>IN this &s;tate of divi&s;ion, he went home to his

He no &s;ooner perceived that the &s;uper&s;cription
was in Emilia's hand-writing, than he gue&s;&s;ed the
nature of the contents; and opening the &s;eal
with di&s;ordered eagerne&s;s, found the jewels he
had given to her, inclo&s;ed in a billet couched in
the&s;e words.</P>
<P>&ldquo;THAT I may have no cau&s;e to reproach
my&s;elf with having retained the lea&s;t me|morial
of a wretch whom I equally de&s;pi&s;e and
abhor, I take this opportunity of re&s;toring the&s;e
<PB N="31" REF="36">
ineffectual in&s;truments of his infamous de&s;ign
upon the honour of Emilia.&rdquo;</P>
<P>His chagrin was &s;o much galled and inflamed
by the bitterne&s;s of this contemptuous me&s;&s;age,
that he gnawed his fingers, till the blood ran over
his nails, and even wept with vexation. Some|times
he vowed revenge again&s;t her haughty vir|tue,
and reviled him&s;elf for his precipitate decla|ration,
before his &s;cheme was brought to matu|rity;
then he would con&s;ider her behaviour with
reverence and regard, and bow before the irre|&s;i&s;tible
power of her attractions. In &s;hort, his
brea&s;t was torn by conflicting pa&s;&s;ions; love,
&s;hame, and remor&s;e contended with vanity, am|bition,
and revenge; and the &s;uperiority was &s;till
doubtful, when head&s;trong de&s;ire interpo&s;ed, and
decided in favour of an attempt towards a recon|ciliation
with the offended fair.</P>
<P>Impelled by this motive, he &s;et out in the af|ternoon
for the hou&s;e of her uncle, not without
hopes of that tender enjoyment, which never
fails to attend an accommodation betwixt two lo|vers
of ta&s;te and &s;en&s;ibility. Though the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of his tre&s;pa&s;s encumbered him with an
air of awkward confu&s;ion, he was too confident
of his own qualifications and addre&s;s to de&s;pair of
forgivene&s;s; and by that time he arrived at the
citizen's gate, he had conned a very artful and
pathetic harangue, which he propo&s;ed to utter
in his own behalf, laying the blame of his conduct
on the impetuo&s;ity of his pa&s;&s;ion, incen&s;ed by the
Burgundy, which he had too liberally drank:
but he did not meet with an opportunity to avail
him&s;elf of this preparation. Emilia, &s;u&s;pecting that
he would take &s;ome &s;tep of this kind to retrieve
<PB N="32" REF="37">
her favour, had gone abroad on pretence of vi|&s;iting,
after having &s;ignified to her kin&s;man, her
re&s;olution to avoid the company of Peregrine, on
account of &s;ome ambiguities which (&s;he &s;aid)
were la&s;t night remarkable in his demeanour, at
the ma&s;querade. She cho&s;e to in&s;inuate her &s;u&s;|picions
in the&s;e hints, rather than give an expli|cit
detail of the young man's di&s;honourable con|trivance,
which might have kindled the re&s;ent|ment
of the family to &s;ome dangerous pitch of
animo&s;ity and revenge.</P>
<P>Our adventurer, finding him&s;elf baffled in his
expectation of &s;eeing her, inquired for the old
gentleman, with whom he thought he had in|fluence
enough to make his apology good, in ca&s;e
he &s;hould find him prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the young la|dy's
information. But here too he was di&s;ap|pointed;
the uncle had gone to dine in the coun|try,
and his wife was indi&s;po&s;ed; &s;o that he had
no pretext for &s;taying in the hou&s;e, till the return
of his charmer. Being, however, fruitful of ex|pedients,
he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his chariot, and took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of a room in a tavern, the windows of
which fronted the merchant's gate; and there
he propo&s;ed to watch until he &s;hould &s;ee her ap|proach.
This &s;cheme he put in practice with
indefatigable patience, though it was not attend|ed
with the expected &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Emilia, who&s;e caution was equally vigilant and
commendable, fore&s;eeing that &s;he might be ex|po&s;ed
to the fertility of his invention, came home
by a private pa&s;&s;age, and entered by a po&s;tern,
which was altogether unknown to her admirer;
and her uncle did not arrive, until it was &s;o late,
that he could not with any decency demand a
conference.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="38">
Next morning, he did not fail to pre&s;ent him|&s;elf
at the door, and his mi&s;tre&s;s being denied by
her own expre&s;s direction, in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;eeing
the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, who received him with
&s;uch coldne&s;s of civility, as plainly gave him to
under&s;tand, that he was acquainted with the di&s;|plea&s;ure
of his niece. He therefore, with an air
of candour, told the citizen, he could ea&s;ily per|ceive,
by his behaviour, that he was the confi|dant
of Mi&s;s Emily, of whom he was come to
a&s;k pardon for the offence he had given; and did
not doubt, if he could be admitted to her pre|&s;ence,
that he &s;hould be able to convince her,
that he had not erred intentionally, or at lea&s;t
propo&s;e &s;uch reparation, as would effectually
atone for his fault.</P>
<P>To this remon&s;trance the merchant, without
any ceremony or circumlocution, an&s;wered, that
though he was ignorant of the nature of his of|fence,
he was very certain, that it mu&s;t have
been &s;omething very flagrant, that could irritate
his niece to &s;uch a degree, again&s;t a per&s;on for
whom &s;he had formerly a mo&s;t particular regard.
He owned, &s;he had declared her intention to re|nounce
his acquaintance for ever, and, doubtle&s;s,
&s;he had good rea&s;on for &s;o doing; neither would
he undertake to promote an accommodation, un|le&s;s
he would give him full power to treat on the
&s;core of matrimony, which he &s;uppo&s;ed would be
the only means of evincing his own &s;incerity, and
obtaining Emilia's forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P>Peregrine's pride was kindled by this blunt de|claration,
which he could not help con&s;idering as
the re&s;ult of a &s;cheme concerted betwixt the
young lady and her uncle, in order to take the ad|vantage
of his heat. He therefore replied, with
<PB N="34" REF="39">
manife&s;t &s;igns of di&s;gu&s;t, that he did not appre|hend
there was any occa&s;ion for a mediator to
reconcile the difference betwixt Emilia and him;
and that all he de&s;ired, was an opportunity of
pleading in his own behalf.</P>
<P>The citizen frankly told him, that as his niece
had expre&s;&s;ed an earne&s;t de&s;ire of avoiding his
company, he would not put the lea&s;t con&s;traint
upon her inclination; and in the mean time gave
him to know, that he was particularly engaged.</P>
<P>Our hero glowing with indignation at this &s;u|percilious
treatment; &ldquo;I was in the wrong (&s;aid
he) to look for good manners, &s;o far on this &s;ide
of Temple-bar: but, you mu&s;t give me leave to
tell you, Sir, that unle&s;s I am favoured with an
interview with Mi&s;s Gauntlet, I &s;hall conclude,
that you have actually laid a con&s;traint upon her
inclination, for &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter purpo&s;es of your
own.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir, (replied the old gentleman) you
are welcome to make what conclu&s;ions &s;hall &s;eem
good unto your own imagination; but, pray be
&s;o good as to allow me the privilege of being
ma&s;ter in my own hou&s;e.&rdquo; So &s;aying, he very
complai&s;antly &s;hewed him to the door; and our
lover, being diffident of his own temper, as well
as afraid of being u&s;ed with greater indignity, in
a place where his per&s;onal prowe&s;s would only
&s;erve to heighten his di&s;grace, quitted the hou&s;e
in a tran&s;port of rage which he could not wholly
&s;uppre&s;s, telling the landlord, that if his age did
not protect him, he would have cha&s;ti&s;ed him for
his in&s;olent behaviour.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He projects a violent &s;cheme, in con&s;equence of
which he is involved in a mo&s;t fatiguing adven|ture,
which greatly tends towards the augmenta|tion
of his chagrin.</HEAD>
<P>THUS debarred of per&s;onal communication
with his mi&s;tre&s;s, he e&s;&s;ayed to retrieve her
good graces by the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and pathetic
letters, which he conveyed by divers artifices to
her peru&s;al; but reaping no manner of benefit
from the&s;e endeavours, his pa&s;&s;ion acquired a de|gree
of impatience, little inferior to downright
frenzy; and he determined to run every ri&s;k of
life, fortune, and reputation, rather than de&s;i&s;t
from his unju&s;tifiable pur&s;uit. Indeed his re&s;ent|ment
was now as deeply concerned as his love,
and each of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions equally turbulent and
loud in demanding gratification. He kept centi|nels
continually in pay, to give him notice of her
outgoings, in expectation of finding &s;ome oppor|tunity
to carry her off; but her circum&s;pection
entirely fru&s;trated this de&s;ign; for &s;he &s;u&s;pected
every thing of that &s;ort from a di&s;po&s;ition like
his, and regulated her motions accordingly.</P>
<P>Baffied by her prudence and penetration, he
altered his plan, and, on pretence of being called
to his country-hou&s;e by &s;ome affair of importance,
he departed from London, and taking lodgings at
a farmer's hou&s;e, that &s;tood near the road through
which &s;he mu&s;t have nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;&s;ed, in her
return to her mother, concealed him&s;elf from all
intercour&s;e, except with his valet de chambre
and Pipes, who had orders to &s;cour the country,
<PB N="36" REF="41">
and reconnoitre every hor&s;e, coach, or carriage,
that &s;hould appear on that high way, with a view
of intercepting his Amanda in her pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>He had waited in this ambu&s;cade a whole week,
when his valet gave him notice, that he and his
fellow-&s;cout had di&s;covered a chai&s;e and &s;ix, dri|ving
at full &s;peed towards them; upon which,
they had flapped their hats over their eyes, &s;o as
that they might not be known, in ca&s;e they
&s;hould be &s;een, and concealed them&s;elves behind
a hedge, from whence they could perceive in the
carriage, as it pa&s;&s;ed, a young man plainly dre&s;&s;ed,
with a lady in a ma&s;k, of the exact &s;ize, &s;hape, and
air of Emilia; and that Pipes followed them at a
di&s;tance, while he rode back to communicate this
piece of intelligence.</P>
<P>Peregrine would &s;carce allow him time to con|clude
his information; he ran down to the &s;table,
where his hor&s;e was kept ready &s;addled for the
purpo&s;e, and never doubting that the lady in
que&s;tion was his mi&s;tre&s;s, attended by one of her
uncle's clerks, mounted immediately, and rode
full gallop after the chai&s;e, which (when he had
proceeded about two miles) he under&s;tood from
Pipes, had put up at a neighbouring inn. Though
his inclination prompted him to enter her apart|ment
without farther delay, he &s;uffered him&s;elf
to be di&s;&s;uaded from taking &s;uch a precipitate
&s;tep, by his privy coun&s;ellor, who ob&s;erved, that
it would be impracticable to execute his purpo&s;e
of conveying her again&s;t her will from a public
inn, that &s;tood in the mid&s;t of a populous village,
which would infallibly ri&s;e in her defence; and
advi&s;ed him to lie in wait for the chai&s;e, in &s;ome
remote and private part of the road, where they
might accompli&s;h their aim without difficulty or
<PB N="37" REF="42">
danger. In con&s;equence of this admonition, our
adventurer ordered Pipes to reconnoitre the inn,
that &s;he might not e&s;cape another way, while he
and the valet, in order to avoid being &s;een, took
a circuit by an unfrequented path, and placed
them&s;elves in ambu&s;h, on a &s;pot which they cho&s;e
for the &s;cene of their atchievement. Here they
tarried a full hour, without &s;eeing the carriage,
or heating from their centinel; &s;o that the youth,
unable to exert his patience one moment longer,
le&s;t the foreigner in his &s;tation, and rode back to
his faithful lacquey, who a&s;&s;ured him, that the
travellers had not yet have up their anchor, or
proceeded on their voyage.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this intimation, Pickle began
to entertain &s;uch alarming &s;u&s;picions, that he
could not refrain from advancing to the gate,
and inquiring for the company which had lately
arrived in a chai&s;e and &s;ix. The inn-keeper,
who was not at all plea&s;ed with the behaviour of
tho&s;e pa&s;&s;engers, did not think proper to ob&s;erve
the in&s;tructions he had received; on the con|t$ary,
he plainly told him, that the chai&s;e did not
halt, but only entered at one door, and went
out at the other, with a view to deceive tho&s;e
who pur&s;ued it, as he gue&s;&s;ed from the words of
the gentleman, who had earne&s;tly de&s;ired, that
his route might be concealed from any per&s;on who
&s;hould inquire about their motions. &ldquo;As for
my own peart, mea&s;ter, (continued this chari|table
publican) I believes as $ow they are no
better than they &s;hould be, el&s;e they wouldn't be
in &s;uch a deadly fear of being overtaken. Me|thinks,
(&s;aid I) when I &s;aw them in &s;uch a
woundy pother to be gone, oddsheartikins! this
mu&s;t be &s;ome Lundon prentice running away with
<PB N="38" REF="43">
this mea&s;ter's daughter, as &s;ure as I'm a living
&s;oul. But, be he who will, &s;artain it is, a$
has nothing of the gentleman about en; for,
tho&s; a axed &s;uch a &s;avour, a never once put hand
in pocket, or &s;aid, &ldquo;Dog, will you drink?&rdquo;
How&s;omever, that don't argufy in reverence of
his being in a hurry; and a man may be &s;ome|times
a little too judgmatical in his conjunctures.&rdquo;
In all probability, this loquacious landlord would
have &s;erved the travellers effectually, had Pere|grine
heard him to an end; but this impetuous
youth, far from li&s;tening to the &s;equel of his ob|&s;ervations,
interrupted him in the beginning of
his career, by a&s;king eagerly, which road they
followed; and having received the inn-keeper;
directions, clapp'd &s;purs to his hor&s;e, command|ing
Pipes to make the valet acquainted with his
cour&s;e, that they might attend him with all ima|ginable
di&s;patch.</P>
<P>By the publican's account of their conduct,
his former opinion was fully confirmed; he plied
his &s;teed to the height of his mettle, and &s;o much
was his imagination ingro&s;&s;ed by the pro&s;pect of
having Emilia in his power, that he did not per|ceive
the road on which he travelled, was quite
different from that which led to the habitation of
Mrs. Gauntlet. The valet de chambre was at
utter &s;tranger to that part of the country; an$
as for Mr. Pipes, &s;uch con&s;iderations were alto|gether
foreign to the oeconomy of his reflection.</P>
<P>Ten long miles had our hero rode, when hi$
eyes were ble&s;&s;ed with the fight of the chai&s;e a&s;|cending
an hill, at the di&s;tance of a good league$
upon which, he doubled his diligence in &s;uch:
manner, that he gained upon the carriage eve$
minute, and at length approached &s;o near to i$
<PB N="39" REF="44">
that he could di&s;cern the lady and her conductor,
with their heads thru&s;t out at the windows, look|ing
back, and &s;peaking to the driver alternately,
as if they earne&s;tly be&s;ought him to augment the
&s;peed of his cattle.</P>
<P>Being thus, as it were, in fight of port, while
he cro&s;&s;ed the road, his hor&s;e happened to plunge
into a cart-rut, with &s;uch violence, that he was
thrown &s;everal yards over his head; and the
bea&s;t's &s;houlder being &s;lipt by the fall, he found
him&s;elf di&s;abled from plucking the fruit, which
was almo&s;t within his reach; for he had left his
&s;ervants at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance behind him;
and although they had been at his back, and &s;up|plied
him with another hor&s;e, they were &s;o in|differently
mounted, that he could not rea&s;onably
expect to overtake the flyers, who profited &s;o
much by this di&s;a&s;ter, that the chai&s;e vani&s;hed in
a moment.</P>
<P>It may be ea&s;ily conceived, how a young man
of his di&s;po&s;ition pa&s;&s;ed his time, in this tanta|lizing
&s;ituation. He ejaculated with great fer|vency,
but his prayers were not the effects of re|&s;ignation.
He ran back on foot with incredible
&s;peed, in order to meet his valet, whom he un|hor&s;ed
in a twinkling; and taking his &s;eat, be|gan
to exerci&s;e his whip and &s;purs, after having
ordered the Swi&s;s to follow him on the other
gelding, and commit the lame hunter to the care
of Pipes.</P>
<P>Matters being adju&s;ted in this manner, our
adventurer pro&s;ecuted the race with all his might;
and having made &s;ome progre&s;s, was informed
by a countryman, that the chai&s;e had &s;truck off
into another road, and, according to his judg|ment,
was by that time about three miles ahead;
<PB N="40" REF="45">
though, in all probability, the hor&s;es would not
be able to hold out much longer, becau&s;e they
&s;eemed to be quite &s;pent when they pa&s;&s;ed his
door. Encouraged by this intimation, Peregrine
pu&s;hed on with great alacrity; though he could
not regain fight of the de&s;ired object, till the
clouds of night began to deepen, and even then
he enjoyed nothing more than a tran&s;ient glimp&s;e;
for the carriage was no &s;ooner &s;een, than &s;hroud|ed
again from his view. The&s;e vexatious cir|cum&s;tances
animated his endeavours, while they
irritated his chagrin; and in &s;hort, he continued
his pur&s;uit till the night was far advanced, and
him&s;elf &s;o uncertain about the object of his care,
that he entered a &s;olitary inn, with a view of ob|taining
&s;ome intelligence, and to his infinite joy,
perceived the chai&s;e &s;tanding by it&s;elf, and the
hor&s;es panting in the yard. In full confidence
of his having arrived at la&s;t at the goal of all his
wi&s;hes, he alighted in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, and running
up to the coachman, with a pi&s;tol in his hand,
commanded him, in an imperious tone, to con|duct
him to the lady's chamber, on pain of death.
The driver, affrighted at this menacing addre&s;s,
prote&s;ted with great humility, that he did not know
whither his fare had retired; for that he him&s;elf
was paid and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from this &s;ervice, becau&s;e he
would not undertake to drive them all night cro&s;s
the country, without &s;topping to refre&s;h his hor&s;es:
but he promi&s;ed to go in que&s;t of the waiter, who
would &s;hew him to their apartment. He was ac|cordingly
detached on that errand, while our
hero &s;tood centinel at the gate, till the arrival
of his valet de chamb$e, who joining him by ac|cident,
before the coachman returned, relieved
him in his watch; and then the young gentle|man,
<PB N="41" REF="46">
man, exa&s;perated at his me&s;&s;enger's delay, ru&s;hed
with fury in his eyes from room to room, de|nouncing
vengeance upon the whole family; but
he did not meet with one living &s;oul, until he en|rered
the garret, where he found the landlord and
his wife in bed. This chicken-hearted couple,
by the light of a ru&s;h-candle that burned on the
hearth, &s;eeing a &s;tranger bur&s;t into the chamber,
in &s;uch a terrible attitude, were &s;eized with con|&s;ternation;
and exalting their voices, in a mo&s;t
$$mentable &s;train, begg'd for the pa&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t,
that he would &s;pare their lives, and take all
they had.</P>
<P>Peregrine, gue&s;&s;ing from this exclamation, and
the circum&s;tance of their being abed, that they
mi&s;took him for a robber, and were ignorant of
that which he wanted to know, di&s;pelled their
terror, by making them acquainted with the cau&s;e
of his vi&s;it, and de&s;ired the hu&s;band to get up
with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t and
attend him in his &s;earch.</P>
<P>Thus reinforced, he rummaged every corner
of the inn, and at la&s;t finding the o&s;tler in the
&s;table, was by him informed, (to his un&s;peak|able
mortification) that the gentleman and lady
who arrived in the chai&s;e, had immediately hired
po$t-hor&s;es for a certain village at the di&s;tance of
fifteen miles, and departed without halting for
the lea&s;t refre&s;hment. Our adventurer, mad
with his di&s;appointment, mounted his hor&s;e in an
in$eant, and, with his attendant, took the &s;ame
road, with fall determination to die, rather than
de&s;i&s;t from the pro&s;ecution of his de&s;ign. He
had, by this time, rodeupwards of thirty miles &s;ince
three o'clock in the afternoon; &s;o that the hor&s;es
were almo&s;t quite jaded, and travelled this &s;tage
<PB N="42" REF="47">
&s;o &s;lowly, that it was morning before they reached
the place of their de&s;tination, where, far from
finding the fugitives, he under&s;tood, that no &s;uch
per&s;ons as he de&s;cribed had pa&s;&s;ed that way, and
that, in all likelihood, they had taken a quite
contrary direction, while, in order to mi&s;lead him
in his pur&s;uit, they had amu&s;ed the ho&s;tler with a
fal&s;e route. This conjecture was &s;trengthned,
by his perceiving (now for the fir&s;t time) that
he had deviated a con&s;iderable way from the road,
through which they mu&s;t have journeyed, in or|der
to arrive at the place of her mother's re&s;i|dence;
and the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions utterly deprived him
of the &s;mall remains of recollection, which he
had hitherto retained. His eyes rolled about,
witne&s;&s;ing rage and di&s;traction; he foamed at the
mouth, &s;tamped upon the ground with great vio|lence,
uttered incoherent imprecations again&s;t
him&s;elf and all mankind, and would have &s;allied
forth again he knew not whither, upon the &s;ame
hor&s;e, which he had already almo&s;t killed with
fatigue, had not his confident found means to
quiet the tumult of his thoughts, and recal his
reflection, by repre&s;enting the condition of the
poor animals, and advi&s;ing him to hire fre&s;h
hor&s;es, and ride po&s;t acro&s;s the country, to the
village in the neighbourhood of Mrs. Gauntlet's
habitation, where they &s;hould infallibly intercept
the daughter, provided they could get the &s;tart
of her upon the road.</P>
<P>Peregrine not only reli&s;hed, but forthwith
acted in conformity with this good coun&s;el. His
own hor&s;es were committed to the charge of the
landlord, with directions for Pipes, in ca&s;e he$
&s;hould come thither in que&s;t of his ma&s;ter; and
a couple of &s;tout geldings being prepared, he and
<PB N="43" REF="48">
his valet took the road again, &s;teering their cour&s;e
according to the motions of the po&s;t-boy, who
undertook to be their guide. They had almo&s;t
fini&s;hed the fir&s;t &s;tage, when they de&s;cried a
po&s;t-chai&s;e ju&s;t halting at the inn where they pro|po&s;ed
to change hor&s;es; upon which, our adven|turer,
glowing with a mo&s;t intere&s;ting pre&s;age,
put his bea&s;t to the full &s;peed, and approached
near enough to di&s;tingui&s;h, (as the travellers
quitted the carriage) that he had at la&s;t come up
with the very individual per&s;ons whom he had
pur&s;ued &s;o long.</P>
<P>Flu&s;hed with the di&s;covery, he galloped into
the yard &s;o &s;uddenly, that the lady and her con|ductor
&s;carce had time to &s;hut them&s;elves up in
a chamber, to which they retreated with great
precipitation; &s;o that the pur&s;uer was now cer|tain
of having hou&s;ed his prey. That he might,
however, leave nothing to fortune, he placed
him&s;elf upon the &s;tair, by which they had a&s;cended
to the apartment, and &s;ent up his compliments to
the young lady, de&s;iring the favour of being ad|mitted
to her pre&s;ence, otherwi&s;e he &s;hould he
obliged to wave all ceremony, and take that li|berty
which $he would not give. The &s;ervant
having conveyed this me&s;&s;age through the key|hole,
returned with an an&s;wer, importing, that
&s;he would adhere to the re&s;olution &s;he had taken,
and peri&s;h rather than comply with his will.
Our a$venturer, without &s;taying to make any
rejoinder to this reply, ran up &s;tairs, and thun|dering
at the door for entrance, was given to un|der&s;tand
by the nymph's attendant, that a blun|derbu&s;s
was ready primed for his reception, and
that he would do well to &s;pare him the nece&s;&s;ity
of &s;hedding blood, in defence of a per&s;on who
<PB N="44" REF="49">
had put her&s;elf under his protection. &ldquo;All the
laws of the land (&s;aid he) cannot now untie the
knots by which we are bound together; and
therefore I will guard her as my own property;
&s;o that you had better de&s;i&s;t from your fruitle&s;s
attempt, and thereby con&s;ult your own &s;afety:
for, by the God that made me! I will di&s;charge
my piece upon you, as &s;oon as you &s;et your no&s;e
within the door; and your blood be upon your
own head.&rdquo; The&s;e menaces from a citizen's
clerk, would have been &s;ufficient motives for
Pickle to &s;torm the breach, although they had
not been reinforced by that declaration, which
informed him of Emilia's having be&s;towed her&s;elf
in marriage upon &s;uch a contemptible rival. This
&s;ole con&s;ideration added wings to his impetuo&s;ity,
and he applied his foot to the door with &s;uch irre|&s;i&s;tible
force, as bur&s;ted it open in an in&s;tant, en|tering
at the &s;ame time with a pi&s;tol ready cock'd
in his hand. His antagoni&s;t, in&s;tead of firing
his blunderbu&s;s, when he &s;aw him approach,
&s;tarted back, with evident &s;igns of &s;urprize and
con&s;ternation, exclaiming, &ldquo;Lord Je&s;us! Sir,
you are not the man! and, without doubt, are
under &s;ome mi&s;take with regard to us.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Before Peregrine had time to an&s;wer this &s;alu|tation,
the lady hearing it, advanced to him,
and pulling off a ma&s;k, di&s;covered a face which
he had never &s;een before. The Gorgon's head,
according to the fables of antiquity, never had a
more initantan$ous or petrifying effect, than that
which this countenance produced upon the a&s;to|ni&s;hed
youth. His eyes were fixed upon this un|known
object, as if they had been attracted by
the power of inchantment, his feet &s;eemed $$|vetted
to the ground, and after having &s;tood mo|tionle&s;s
<PB N="45" REF="50">
for the &s;pace of a few minutes, he dropped
down in an apoplexy of di&s;appointment and de|&s;pair.
The Swi&s;s, who had followed him, &s;ee|ing
his ma&s;ter in this condition, lifted him up,
and laying him upon a bed in the next room, let
him blood immediately, without he&s;itation, be|ing
always provided with a ca&s;e of lancets, again&s;t
all accidents on the road. To this fore&s;ight our
hero, in all probability, was indebted for his life.
By virtue of a very copious evacuation, he re|covered
the u&s;e of his &s;en&s;es; but the complica|tion
of fatigues, and violent tran&s;ports which he
had undergone, brewed up a dangerous fever in
his blood; and a phy&s;ician being called from the
next market-town, &s;everal days elap&s;ed before
he would an&s;wer for his life.</P>

<P>AT length, however, his con&s;titution over|came
his di&s;ea&s;e, though not before it had
in a great mea&s;ure tamed the fury of his di&s;po|&s;ition,
and brought him to a &s;erious con&s;ideration
of his conduct. In this humiliation of his &s;pirits,
he reflected with &s;hame and remor&s;e upon his
treachery to the $air, the innocent Emilia; he
remembered his former &s;entiments in her $avour,
as well as the injunctions of his dying uncle; he
recollected his intimacy with her brother, again&s;t
which he had &s;o ba&s;ely &s;inned; and revolving all
the circum&s;tances of her conduct, found it &s;o
commendable, &s;pirited, and $word$ that he deemed
her an object of &s;ufficient dignity to merit his ho|nourable
<PB N="46" REF="51">
addre&s;&s;es, even though his duty had not
been concerned in the deci&s;ion: but, obligated as
he was, to make reparation to a worthy family,
which he had &s;o gro&s;ly injured, he thought he
could not manife&s;t his reformation too &s;oon; and,
whenever he found him&s;elf able to hold the pen,
wrote a letter to Mrs. Gauntlet, wherein he ac|knowledged,
with many expre&s;&s;ions of &s;orrow and
contrition, that he had acted a part altogether
unbecoming a man of honour, and &s;hould never
enjoy the lea&s;t tranquillity of mind, until he
&s;hould have merited her forgivene&s;s. He pro|te&s;ted,
that although his happine&s;s intirely de|pended
upon the determination of Emilia, he
would even renounce all hope of being ble&s;&s;ed
with her favour, if &s;he could point out any other
method of making reparation to that amiable
young lady, but by laying his heart and fortune
at her feet, and &s;ubmitting him&s;elf to her plea|&s;ure
during the remaining part of his life. He
conjured her, therefore, in the mo&s;t pathetic
manner, to pardon him, in con&s;ideration of his
&s;incere repentance, and u&s;e her maternal influence
with her daughter, &s;o as that he might be per|mitted
to wait upon her with a wedding-ring, as
&s;oon as his health would allow him to undertake
the journey.</P>
<P>This explanation being di&s;patched by Pipes,
who had, by this time, found his ma&s;ter, the
young gentleman inquired about the couple whom
he had &s;o unfortunately par&s;ued, and under&s;tood
from his valet de chambre, who learn'd the &s;tory
from their own mouths, that the lady was the
only daughter of a rich Jew, and her attendant
no other than his apprentice, who had converted
her to chri&s;tianity, and married her at the &s;ame
<PB N="47" REF="52">
time; that this &s;ecret having taken air, the old
I&s;raelite had contrived a &s;cheme to &s;eparate them
for ever; and they being apprized of his inten|tion,
had found means to elope from his hou&s;e,
with a view of &s;heltering them&s;elves in France,
until the affair could be made up: that &s;eeing
three men ride after them with &s;uch eagerne&s;s
and &s;peed, they never doubted that the pur&s;uers
were her father, accompanied by &s;ome friends or
dome&s;tics, and on that &s;uppo&s;ition had fled with
the utmo&s;t di&s;patch and trepidation, until they
had found them&s;elves happily undeceived, at that

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>&ldquo;SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received the favour of yours, and am glad,
for your own &s;ake, that you have attained a
due &s;en&s;e and conviction of your unkind and un|chri&s;tian
behaviour to poor Emy. I thank God,
none of my children were ever &s;o in&s;ulted before.
Give me leave to tell you, Sir, my daughter was
no up&s;tart, without friends or education, but a
young lady as well bred, and better born, than
mo&s;t private gentlewomen in the kingdom: and
therefore, though you had no e&s;teem for her per|&s;on,
you ought to have paid &s;ome regard to her
<PB N="48" REF="53">
family, which (no di&s;paragement to you, Sir) is
more honourable than your own. As for your
propo&s;al, Mi&s;s Gauntlet will not hear of it, be|ing,
that &s;he thinks her honour will not allow her
to li&s;ten to any terms of reconciliation; and &s;he
is not yet &s;o de&s;titute, as to embrace an offer to
which &s;he has the lea&s;t objection. In the mean
time, &s;he is &s;o much indi&s;po&s;ed, that &s;he cannot
po&s;&s;ibly &s;ee company; &s;o I beg you will not take
the trouble of making a fruitle&s;s journey to this
place. Perhaps your future conduct may de&s;erve
her forgivene&s;s; and really, as I am concerned
for your happine&s;s, which (you a&s;&s;ure me) de|pends
upon her conde&s;cen&s;ion, I wi&s;h with all my
heart it may; and am (notwith&s;tanding all that
has happened)</P>

</LETTER>
<P>From this epi&s;tle, and the information of his
me&s;&s;enger, our hero learn'd, that his mi&s;tre&s;s
had actually profited by his wild-goo&s;e-chace, &s;o
as to make a &s;afe retreat to her mother's hou&s;e
and, though &s;orry to hear of her indi&s;po&s;ition, he
was al&s;o piqued at her implacability, as well as
at &s;ome &s;tately paragraphs of the letter, in which
(he thought) the good lady had con&s;ulted her own
vanity rather than her good &s;en&s;e. The&s;e motives
of re&s;entment helped him to bear his di&s;appoint|ment
like a philo&s;opher, e&s;pecially as he had
now quieted his con&s;cience, in proffering to re|dre&s;s
the injury he had done; and, moreover,
found him&s;elf, with regard to his love, in a calm
&s;tate of hope and re&s;ignation.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="54">
A &s;ea&s;onable fit of illne&s;s is an excellent me|dicine
for the turbulence of pa&s;&s;ion. Such a re|formation
had the fever produced in the oeconomy
of his thoughts, that he moralized like an apo&s;tle,
and projected &s;everal prudential &s;chemes for his
future conduct.</P>
<P>In the mean time, as &s;oon as his health was
&s;ufficiently re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, he took a trip to the
gari&s;on, in order to vi&s;it his friends; and learn'd
from Hatchway's own mouth, that he had broke
the ice of court&s;hip to his aunt, and that his ad|dre&s;&s;es
were now fairly afloat; though when he
fir&s;t declared him&s;elf to the widow, after &s;he had
been duly prepared for the occa&s;ion, by her niece
and the re&s;t of her friends, &s;he had received his
propo&s;al with a becoming re&s;erve, and piou&s;ly
wept at the remembrance of her hu&s;band, ob|&s;erving,
that &s;he &s;hould never meet with his
follow.</P>
<P>Peregrine promoted the lieutenant's &s;uit with
all his influence; and all Mrs. Trunnion's ob|jections
to the match being &s;urmounted, it was
determined, that the day of marriage &s;hould be
put off for three months, that her reputation
might not &s;uffer by a precipitate engagement.
His next care was to give orders for erecting a
plain marble monument to the memory of his
uncle, on which the following in&s;cription, com|po&s;ed
by the bridegroom, actually appeared in
golden letters.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LXXXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He returns to London, and meets with Cadwal|lader,
who entertains him with a curious dia|logue.</HEAD>
<P>THE young gentleman having performed
the&s;e la&s;t offices, in honour of his decea&s;ed
benefactor, and pre&s;ented Mr. Jolter to the long|expected
living, which at this time happened to
be vacant, returned to London, and re&s;umed his
former gaiety: not that he was able to &s;hake
Emilia from his thoughts, or even to remember
her without violent emotions; for, as he reco|vered
his vigour, his former impatience recurred,
and therefore he re&s;olved to plunge him&s;elf head|long
into &s;ome intrigue, that might engage his
pa&s;&s;ions, and amu&s;e his imagination.</P>
<P>A man of his accompli&s;hments could not fail
to meet with a variety of &s;ubjects, on which his
gallantry would have been properly exerci&s;ed;
and this abundance di&s;tracted his choice, which
at any time was apt to be influenced by caprice
and whim. I have already ob&s;erved, that he had
lifted his view, through a matrimonial per&s;pec|tive,
as high as a lady of the fir&s;t quality and di|&s;tinction;
and now, that he was refu&s;ed by Mi&s;s
Gauntlet, and enjoyed a little re&s;pite from the
ag$nies of that flame which her charms had
kindled in his heart, he renewed his a&s;&s;iduities to
her grace; and, though he dur&s;t not yet ri&s;k an
explanation, enjoyed the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing him|&s;elf
&s;o well received in quality of a particular ac|quaintance,
that he flattered him&s;elf with the be|lief
of his having made &s;ome progre&s;s in her
<PB N="52" REF="57">
heart; and was confirmed in this conceited no|tion,
by the a&s;&s;urances of her woman, whom, by
liberal large&s;&s;es, he retained in his intere&s;t, be|cau&s;e
&s;he found means to per&s;uade him, that &s;he
was in the confidence of her lady. But, not|with&s;tanding
this encouragement, and the &s;an|guine
&s;ugge&s;tions of his own vanity, he dreaded
the thoughts of expo&s;ing him&s;elf to her ridicule
and re&s;entment, by a premature declaration, and
determined to po&s;tpone his addre&s;&s;es, until he
&s;hould be more certified of the probability of &s;uc|ceeding
in his attempt.</P>
<P>While he remained in this he&s;itation and &s;u&s;|pence,
he was one morning very agreeably &s;ur|prized
with the appearance of his friend Crabtree,
who, by the permi&s;&s;ion of Pipes, to whom he
was well known, entered his chamber before he
was awake, and, by a violent &s;hake of the
&s;houlder, di&s;engaged him from the arms of &s;leep.
The fir&s;t compliments having mutually pa&s;&s;ed,
Cadwallader gave him to under&s;tand, that he had
arrived in town over-night in the &s;tage-coach
from Bath, and entertained him with &s;uch a lu|dicrous
account of his fellow-travellers, that Pe|regrine,
for the fir&s;t time &s;ince their parting, in|dulged
him&s;elf in mirth, even to the hazard of
&s;uffocation.</P>
<P>This relation was confined to a curious dia|logue
that pa&s;&s;ed betwixt a woollen-draper and
his wi$e, who were his only companions during
the be&s;t part of the journey. The lady laboured
under a Diabetes, in con&s;equence of having u&s;ed
the waters injudiciou&s;ly for another complaint;
and, that &s;he might not be an impediment to the
carriage, by ordering it to halt, as often as &s;he
&s;hould have occa&s;ion to di&s;embogue, &s;he had pro|vided
<PB N="53" REF="58">
her&s;elf with a leathern convenience, which
her hu&s;band carried in the pocket of his great
coat, conveying it privately to her, when &s;he
found her&s;elf nece&s;&s;itated to u&s;e it; and after|wards,
taking the opportunity to empty it out at
the window, when the Mi&s;anthrope's head chanced
to be turned another way.</P>
<P>As this couple embarked with Crabtree, in the
full per&s;ua&s;ion of his being utterly bereft of the
&s;en&s;e of hearing, they kept no &s;ort of re&s;erve in
their conver&s;ation; and at la&s;t fairly quarrelled,
on account of the good man's want of alertne&s;s,
in handing the commodity, when his help-mate's
occa&s;ions were &s;o extremely pre&s;&s;ing, that her
flood-gates gave way, before &s;he was prepared for
the irruption. Smarting with this di&s;agreeable
circum&s;tance, &ldquo;Odds plague! you nincompoop,
(cried &s;he) you have fumbled &s;o long about the
pot, that I have drenched my&s;elf all over. I
wi&s;h to God you had received the &s;tream in your
mouth.&rdquo; &ldquo;I thank you for your good-will, my
dear, (an&s;wered the patient hu&s;band) you would
promote me to the honour of being a pi&s;&s;ing-po&s;t.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I'm &s;ure, (retorted his yoke-fellow, &s;natching
the uten&s;il from his hand) you are fit for no other
po&s;t; and, accordingly, &s;uffer your&s;elf to be pi&s;s'd
upon by every body. Witne&s;s your pitiful beha|viour
at the E. O. table, when that officer bul|lied
you out of twenty guineas, which you wan't
obliged to pay.&rdquo; &ldquo;There you happen to be
wide of the matter, (&s;aid the draper) the whole
company gave it again&s;t me, as a fair bett; be|&s;ides,
the captain threatened to cut my throat,
and I did not choo&s;e to give him that trouble.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Cut your throat! (exclaimed the virago) I
would a dur&s;t: you had a good action again&s;t him
<PB N="54" REF="59">
for putting you in fear of your life. But you are
a poor tool, good for nothing but &s;quandering
away my money. If you had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;pirit
enough to follow my advice, you might have been
a deputy of the ward, by this time. But, all
your care is to &s;it among your companions of the
garden, and &s;ing bunting-&s;ongs, till you get drunk,
leaving your trade at &s;ixes and &s;evens, and your
family to go to the dogs.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The hu&s;band (pacific as he was) being nettled
at the&s;e in&s;inuations, frankly told her, that his
affairs had never pro&s;pered, &s;ince &s;he had per|&s;uaded
him to &s;wear a book-debt again&s;t a gen|tleman's
executor, after he had been paid by the
decea&s;ed. Upon which, her eyes lightened with
fury, and &s;he called him a mean-&s;pirited &s;orry
fellow, for upbraiding her, a weak woman, with
what &s;he had done for his own good. &ldquo;Sirrah,
(&s;aid &s;he) I &s;uppo&s;e you would be ba&s;e enough
to turn evidence again&s;t me, if you thought you
could get any thing by the information, though
that was the only thing you ever did for your
poor family. Who is to provide for my children,
if their father don't?&rdquo; &ldquo;And I wi&s;h from my
heart their father would provide for them.&rdquo; (&s;aid
the hu&s;band, irritated by the epithets &s;he had ut|tered.)
&ldquo;An't you their father, Mr. Wi&s;eacre,
(cried the aggre&s;&s;or:) Ha'n't I brought you five
as fine babes as any in the pari&s;h?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, yes,
(replied the other) you have brought me &s;everal
very fine children, that mu&s;t be allowed; but,
whether or not they are of my begetting, is a
que&s;tion that I am not quite &s;o clear about.&rdquo;
&ldquo;How, fellor! (replied the wife) do you doubt
my vartue?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, not I, (an&s;wered the
&s;hopkeeper) I have no doubts about the matter.
<PB N="55" REF="60">
It is a long time &s;ince &s;urgeon C&mdash;a&s;&s;ured me,
that he would &s;uckle upon his thumb all the chil|dren
I &s;hould ever beget; and I have other con|vincing
rea&s;ons to &s;upport his opinion.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The&s;e la&s;t words had &s;carce proceeded from his
mouth, when his &s;weet-blooded &s;pou&s;e, leaving
her duty and obedience on the left hand, and for|getting
that &s;he was &s;ubject to the eye of any un|concerned
&s;pectator, lifted up the machine &s;he
had ju&s;t repleni&s;hed, and made &s;uch application
with it to the forehead of her hu&s;band, as pre&s;&s;ed
the two &s;ides of it together, by which means,
the contents were &s;quirted out in a full &s;tream,
that played upon the vi&s;age of the a&s;toni&s;hed
Mi&s;anthrope; and, not &s;atisfied with the ven|geance
&s;he had taken, &s;he quitted her weapon,
and a&s;&s;aulted him with tooth and nail, exclaim|ing
all the time, &ldquo;Ah! you pitiful cuckoldy
&s;crub, have you the impudence to own to my
face, that you married a woman of my character,
when you knew your own infirmities? You
had a ba&s;e de&s;ign upon my fortune, you &s;lave,
although you was &s;en&s;ible that you could never
de&s;erve it. But, I'll be revenged of you, if
there be a man to be had for love or money.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Thus, far from attempting to clear her&s;elf
from the imputation implied in her hu&s;band's
words, &s;he con&s;trued his declaration into an ac|knowledgment
of the ill u&s;age &s;he had &s;uffered;
and while &s;he trumpeted her own wrongs, with
great vociferation, exerci&s;ed her claws with &s;uch
rancour and agility, that the poor draper was
fain to roar aloud for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and as Cadwal|lader
had no inclination to interpo&s;e, he would,
in all probability, have met with the fate of Or|pheus,
had not his cries reached the ears of the

partly by threats, and partly by intreaties, put an

<P>CRabtree having rehear&s;ed this adventure, in
&s;uch a peculiarity of manner, as added in|finite
ridicule to every circum&s;tance, and re|peated
every &s;candalous report which had circu|lated
at the Bath, after Peregrine's departure,

in all appearance had no rea&s;on to complain of

of her &s;entiments: and therefore, he
begg'd leave to depend upon the intelligence of
his friend Cadwallader, who, he knew, was ad|mitted
to her parties.</P>
<P>The Mi&s;an hrope, before he would promi&s;e his

matrimony? and our adventurer (who gue&s;&s;ed
the meaning of his que&s;tion) replaying in the ne|gative,
he undertook the office of reconnoitring
her inclination, prote&s;ting at the &s;ame time, that
he would never concern him&s;elf in any &s;cheme,
that did not tend to the di&s;grace and deception of
ail the &s;ex. On the&s;e conditions, he e&s;pou&s;ed
the intere&s;t of our hero, and a plan was imme|diately
concerted, in con&s;equence of which they
met by accident at her grace's table; and Pickle
<PB N="57" REF="62">
having &s;tayed all the fore-part of the evening,
and &s;at out all the company, except the Mi&s;an|thrope
and a certain widow-lady, who was &s;aid
to be in the &s;ecrets of my lady duche&s;s, went
away, on pretence of an indi&s;pen&s;ible engage|ment,
that Crabtree might have a proper oppor|tunity
of making him the &s;ubject of conver|&s;ation.</P>
<P>Accordingly, he had &s;carce quitted the apart|ment,
when this Cynic attending him to the
door, with a look of moro&s;e di&s;dain, &ldquo;Were I
an ab&s;olute prince, (&s;aid he) and that fellow one
of my &s;ubjects, I would order him to be cloath'd
in &s;ack cloth, and he &s;hould drive my a&s;&s;es to
water, that his lofty &s;pirit might be lowered to
the level of his de&s;erts. The pride of a peacock
is dewnright &s;elf-denial, when compared with
the vanity of that coxcomb, which was naturally
arrogant, but is now rendered altogether into|lerable
by the reputation he acquired at Bath,
for kicking a bully, outwitting a club of raw
&s;harpers, and divers other pranks, in the execu|tion
of which he was more lucky than wi&s;e. But
nothing has contributed &s;o much to the increa&s;e
of his in&s;olence and &s;elf-conceit, as the favour he
found among the ladies. Ay, the ladies, Madam,
I care $ot who knows it: the lad$es, who (to
their honour be it &s;poken) never &s;ail to patronize
foppery and folly, provided they &s;olicit their en|couragement.
And yet, this dog was not on the
footing of tho&s;e hermaphroditical animals, who
may be reckoned among the number of waiting-women,
who air your &s;hifts, comb your lap|dogs,
examine your no&s;es with magnifying gla&s;&s;es,
in order to &s;queeze out the worms, clean your
teeth-bru&s;hes, &s;weeten your handkerchiefs,
<PB N="58" REF="63">
and &s;often wa&s;te paper for your occa&s;ions. This
fellow Pickle was entertained for more important
purpo&s;es; his turn of duty never came till all
tho&s;e lapwings were gone to roo&s;t; then he
&s;caled windows, leaped over garden-walls, and
was let in by Mrs. Betty, in the dark. Nay,
the magi&s;trates of Bath complimented him with
the freedom of the corporation, merely becau&s;e,
through his means, the waters had gained extra|ordinary
credit; for every female of a tolerable
appearance, that went thither on account of her
&s;terility, got the better of her complaint, during
his re&s;idence at the Bath: and now, the fellow
thinks no woman can with&s;tand his addre&s;&s;es.
He had not been here three minutes, when I
could perceive with half an eye, that he had
marked out your grace for a conque&s;t; I mean
in an honourable way; though the ra&s;cal has im|pudence
enough to attempt any thing.&rdquo; $word$
&s;aying, he fixed his eyes upon the duche&s;s, wh$
(while her face glowed with indignation) turning
to her confidant, expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf in the&s;e words.
&ldquo;Upon my life! I believe there is actually &s;ome
truth in what this old ruffian &s;ays; I have my&s;elf
ob&s;erved that young fellow eying me with a very
particular &s;tare.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is not to be at all won|dered
at, (&s;aid her friend) that a youth of his
complexion &s;hould be &s;en&s;ible to the charms $word$
your grace; but I dare &s;ay, he would not pre|&s;ume
to entertain any, but the mo&s;t honourable
and re&s;pectful &s;entiments.&rdquo; &ldquo;Re&s;pectful &s;enti|ments!
(cried my lady, with a look of ineffable
di&s;dain) if I thought the fellow had a&s;&s;urance
enough to think of me in any &s;hape, I prote&s;t $word$
would fo$$$d him my hou&s;e. Upon my honour
&s;uch in&s;tances of audacity &s;hould induce per&s;ons
<PB N="59" REF="64">
of quality to keep your &s;mall gentry at a greater
di&s;tance; for they are very apt to grow impu|dent,
upon the lea&s;t countenance or encourage|ment.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Cadwallader, &s;atisfied with this declaration,
changed the &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e, and next day
communicated his di&s;covery to his friend Pickle,
who, upon this occa&s;ion, felt the mo&s;t &s;tinging
&s;en&s;ations of mortifying pride, and re&s;olved to
quit his pro&s;pect with a good grace. Nor did the
execution of this &s;elf-denying &s;cheme co&s;t him
one moment's unea&s;ine&s;s; for his heart had never
been intere&s;ted in the pur&s;uit, and his vanity tri|umphed
in the thoughts of manife&s;ting his in|difference.
Accordingly, the very next time he
vi&s;ited her grace, his behaviour was remarkably
frank, &s;prightly, and di&s;engaged; and the &s;ubject
of love being artfully introduced by the widow,
who had been directed to &s;ound his inclinations,
he rallied the pa&s;&s;ion with great ea&s;e and &s;everity,
and made no &s;cruple of declaring him&s;elf heart|whole.</P>
<P>Though the duche&s;s had re&s;ented his &s;uppo&s;ed
affection, &s;he was now offended at his in&s;en&s;i|bility,
and even &s;ignified her di&s;gu&s;t, by ob|&s;erving,
that perhaps his attention to his own
qualifications &s;creened him from the impre&s;&s;ion
of all other objects.</P>
<P>While he enjoyed this &s;arca&s;m, the meaning
of which he could plainly di&s;cern, the company
was joined by a certain virtuo&s;o, who had gained
free acce&s;s to all the great families of the land,
by his notable talent of go&s;&s;ipping and buffoonery.
He was now in the &s;eventy-fifth year of his age;
his birth was &s;o ob&s;cure, that he &s;carce knew his
father's name, his education &s;uitable to the dig|nity
<PB N="60" REF="65">
of his de&s;cent, his character publickly branded
with homicide, profligacy, and breach of tru&s;t;
yet this man, by the happy inheritance of im|pregnable
effrontery, and a lucky pro&s;titution of
all principle, in rendering him&s;elf &s;ub&s;ervient to
the appetites of the great, had attained to an in|dependency
of fortune, as well as to &s;uch a par|ticular
&s;hare of favour among the quality, that
although he was well known to have pimped for
three generations of the nobility, there was not a
lady of fa&s;hion in the kingdom, who &s;crupled to
admit him to her toilette, or even to be &s;quired
by him, in any public place of entertainment.
Not but that this &s;age was occa&s;ionally u&s;eful to
his fellow-creatures, by the&s;e connexions with
people of fortune; for, he often undertook to
&s;olicite charity in behalf of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed objects, with
a view of embezzling one half of the benefac|tions.
It was an errand of this kind that now
brought him to the hou&s;e of her grace.</P>
<P>After having &s;at a few minutes, he told the
company, that he would favour them with a very
proper opportunity to extend their benevolence,
for the relief of a poor gentlewoman, who was
reduced to the mo&s;t abject mi&s;ery, by the death
of her hu&s;band, and ju&s;t delivered of a couple
of fine boys. They, moreover, under&s;tood from
his information, that this object was daughter of
a good family, who had renounced her, in con|&s;equence
of her marrying an en&s;ign without a
fortune; and even ob&s;tructed his promotion with
all their influence and power; a circum&s;tance of
barbarity, which had made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion
upon his mind, as di&s;ordered his brain, and drove
him to de&s;pair, in a fit of which he had made
<PB N="61" REF="66">
away with him&s;elf, leaving his wife then big with
child, to all the horrors of indigence and grief.</P>
<P>Various were the critici&s;ms on this pathetic
picture, which the old man drew with great ex|pre&s;&s;ion.
My lady duche&s;s concluded, that &s;he
mu&s;t be a creature void of all feeling and re|flection,
who could &s;urvive &s;uch aggravated mi|&s;ery;
therefore, did not de&s;erve to be relieved,
except in the character of a common beggar;
and was generous enough to offer a recommen|dation,
by which &s;he would be admitted into an
infirmary, to which her grace was a &s;ub&s;criber;
at the &s;ame time, advi&s;ing the &s;ollicitor to &s;end
the twins to the Foundling-ho&s;pital, where they
would be carefully nur&s;ed and brought up, &s;o as
to become u&s;eful members of the commonwealth.
Another lady, with all due deference to the opi|nion
of the duche&s;s, was free enough to blame
the genero&s;ity of her grace, which would only
&s;erve to encourage children in their di&s;obedience
to their parents, and might be the means not only
of prolonging the di&s;tre&s;s of the wretched crea|ture,
but al&s;o of ruining the con&s;titution of &s;ome
young heir, perhaps the hope of a great family;
for, &s;he did &s;uppo&s;e that madam, when her month
&s;hould be up, and her brats di&s;po&s;ed of, would
&s;pread her attractions to the public, (provided
&s;he could profit by her per&s;on) and, in the u&s;ual
way, make a regular progre&s;s from St. James's
to Drury-lane. She apprehended, for the&s;e rea|&s;ons,
that their compa&s;&s;ion would be mo&s;t effec|tually
&s;hewn, in leaving her to peri&s;h in her pre|&s;ent
nece&s;&s;ity; and that the old gentleman would
be unpardonable, &s;hould he per&s;i&s;t in his endea|vours
to relieve her. A third member of this
tender-hearted &s;ociety, after having a&s;ked if the
<PB N="62" REF="67">
young woman was hand&s;ome? and been an&s;wered
in the negative, allowed, that there was
a great deal of rea&s;on in what had been &s;aid
by the honourable per&s;on who had &s;poke la&s;t
neverthele&s;s, &s;he humbly conceived, her &s;entence
would admit of &s;ome mitigation. &ldquo;Let the
bantlings (&s;aid &s;he) be &s;ent to the ho&s;pital, ac|cording
to the advice of her grace, and a &s;mall
collection be made for the pre&s;ent &s;upport of the
mother; and when her health is recovered,
will take her into my family, in quality of a
upper-&s;ervant, or medium between me and $word$
woman; for, upon my life! I can't endure to
chide, or give directions to a creature, who is
in point of birth and education, but one degree
above the vulgar.&rdquo;</P>
<P>This propo&s;al met with univer&s;al approbation$
The duche&s;s (to her immortal honour) began
the contribution with a crown; &s;o that the $word$
of the company were obliged to re&s;trict their $
berality to half the &s;um, that her grace might $word$
be affronted; and the propo&s;er demanding $word$
poor woman's name and place of abode, the $word$
mediator could not help giving her lady&s;hip
verbal direction, though he was extremely mo$|tified
(on more accounts than one) to find $word$
an i&s;&s;ue to his &s;olicitation.</P>
<P>Peregrine, who, <HI>though humorous as winter
had a tear for pity, and an hand open as $word$
for melting charity,</HI> was &s;hocked at the nature are
re&s;ult of this ungenerous con&s;ultation. He con|tributed
his half-crown, however; and retir$$$
from the company, betook him&s;elf to the lodging
of the forlorn lady in the &s;traw, according to the
direction he had heard. Upon inquiry, he un|der&s;tood,
that &s;he was then vi&s;ited by &s;ome cha$|ritable
<PB N="63" REF="68">
gentlewoman, who had &s;ent for a nur&s;e,
and waited the return of the me&s;&s;enger; and he
&s;ent up his re&s;pects, de&s;iring he might be per|mitted
to &s;ee her, on pretence of having been in|timate
with her late hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Though the poor woman had never heard of
his name, &s;he did not think proper to deny his
reque&s;t; and he was conducted to a paultry
chamber in the third &s;tory, where he found this
unhappy widow &s;itting up in a truckle-bed, and
&s;ockling one of her infants, with the mo&s;t pi|teous
expre&s;&s;ion of angui&s;h in her features, which
were naturally regular and &s;weet, while the
other was fondled on the knee of a per&s;on, who&s;e
attention was &s;o much ingro&s;&s;ed by her little
charge, that for the pre&s;ent &s;he could mind no|thing
el&s;e: and it was not till after the fir&s;t com|pliments
pa&s;&s;ed betwixt the haple&s;s mother and
cat adventurer, that he perceived the &s;tranger's
countenance, which in&s;pired him with the highe&s;t
e&s;teem and admiration. He beheld all the graces
of elegance and beauty, breathing &s;entiment and
beneficence, and &s;oftened into the mo&s;t inchant|ing
tenderne&s;s of weeping &s;ympathy: and when
he declared the cau&s;e of his vi&s;it, which was no
other than the de&s;ire of befriending the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed
lady, to whom he pre&s;ented a bank-note for
twenty pounds, he was favoured with &s;uch a
look of complacency by this amiable phantom,
who might have been ju&s;tly taken for an angel
mini&s;tering to the nece&s;&s;ities of mortals, that his
whole &s;oul was tran&s;ported with love and vene|ration.
Nor was this prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion dimini&s;hed by
the information of the widow, who, after having
$word$ her gratitude in a flood of tears, told
him, that the unknown object of his e&s;teem was
<PB N="64" REF="69">
a per&s;on of honour, who having heard by acci|dent
of her deplorable &s;ituation, had immediately
obeyed the dictates of her humanity, and com$
in per&s;on to relieve her di&s;tre&s;s; that &s;he had $word$
only generou&s;ly &s;upplied her with money for pre|&s;ent
&s;u&s;tenance, but al&s;o undertaken to provide$
nur&s;e for her babes, and even promi&s;ed to favour her
with protection, &s;hould &s;he &s;urvive her pre&s;ent me|lancholy
&s;ituation. To the&s;e articles of intelli|gence
&s;he added, that the name of her benefactre$
was the celebrated lady&mdash;, to who&s;e character
the youth was no &s;tranger, though he had never
&s;een her per&s;on before. The killing edge of her
charms was a little blunted by the accidents of
time and fortune; but no man of ta&s;te and ima|gination,
who&s;e nerves were not quite chille$
with the fro&s;t of age, could, even at that time
look upon her with impunity: and as Peregrine
&s;aw her attractions heightened by the tender of|fice
in which &s;he was engaged, he was &s;mitted
with her beauty, and &s;o ravi&s;hed with her com|pa&s;&s;ion,
that he could not &s;uppre&s;s his emotions
but applauded her benevolence with all the warmth
of enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>Her lady&s;hip received his compliments with
great politene&s;s and affability; and the occa&s;ion
on which they met being equally intere&s;ting to
both, an acquaintance commenced between them
and they concerted mea&s;ures for the benefit $
the widow and her two children, one of whom
our hero be&s;poke for his own god&s;on; for Pick$$
was not &s;o ob&s;cure in the beau monde, but that $word$
&s;ame had reached the ears of this lady, wh$
therefore, did not di&s;courage his advances toward
her friend&s;hip and e&s;teem.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="70">
All the particulars relating to their charge being
adju&s;ted, he attended her lady&s;hip to her own
hou&s;e; and, by her conver&s;ation, had the plea|&s;ure
of finding her under&s;tanding &s;uitable to her
other accompli&s;hments. Nor had &s;he any rea&s;on
to think, that our hero's qualifications had been
exaggerated by common report.</P>
<P>One of their adopted children died before it was
baptized; &s;o that their care concentered in the
other, for whom they &s;tood &s;pon&s;ors; and un|der&s;tanding
that the old agent was become trou|ble&s;ome
in his vi&s;its to the mother, to whom he
now began to admini&s;ter &s;uch coun&s;el as &s;hocked
the delicacy of her virtue, they removed her into
another lodging, where &s;he would not be ex|po&s;ed
to his machinations; and in le&s;s than a
month, our hero learn'd from a nobleman of his
acquaintance, that the hoary pandar had actually
engaged to procure for him, this poor afflicted
gentlewoman; and being fru&s;trated in his inten|tion,
&s;ub&s;tituted in her room a nymph from the
purlieus of Covent-garden, that made his lord|&s;hip
&s;mart &s;everely for the favours &s;he be&s;towed.</P>
<P>Mean while, Peregrine cultivated his new ac|quaintance
with all his art and affiduity, pre|&s;uming,
from the circum&s;tance of her reputation
and fate, as well as on the &s;trength of his own
merit, that, in time, he &s;hould be able to indulge
that pa&s;&s;ion which had begun to glow within his
brea&s;t.</P>
<P>As her lady&s;hip had undergone a va&s;t variety of
fortune and adventure, which he had heard in|di&s;tinctly
related, with numberle&s;s errors and mi&s;|repre&s;entations,
he was no &s;ooner intitled, by
the familiarity of communication, to a&s;k &s;uch a
favour, than he earne&s;tly intreated her to enter|tain
<PB N="66" REF="71">
him with the particulars of her &s;tory; and,
by dint of importunity, &s;he was at length pre|vailed

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The memoirs of a lady of quality.</HEAD>
<P>BY the circum&s;tances of the &s;tory which I am
going to relate, you will be convinced of
my candour, while you are informed of my in|di&s;cretion;
and be enabled, I hope, to perceive,
that how&s;oever my head may have erred, my
heart hath always been uncorrupted, and that I
have been unhappy, <HI>becau&s;e I loved, and was a
woman.</HI></P>
<P>I believe I need not ob&s;erve, that I was the
only child of a man of good fortune, who in|dulged
me, in my infancy, with all the tender|ne&s;s
of paternal affection; and when I was &s;ix
years old, &s;ent me to a private &s;chool, where I
&s;tayed till my age was doubled, and became &s;uch
a favourite, that I was (even in the&s;e early days
carried to all the places of public diver&s;ion, the
court it&s;elf not excepted; an indulgence that flat|tered
my love of plea&s;ure, to which I was natu|rally
addicted, and encouraged tho&s;e ideas of va$$|nity
and ambition, which &s;pring up &s;o early $word$
the human mind.</P>
<P>I was lively and good-natured, my imagination
apt to run riot, my heart liberal and di&s;intere&s;ted
though I was &s;o ob&s;tinately attached to my own
opinions, that I could not well brook contra|diction;
and in the whole of my di&s;po&s;ition, re|&s;embled
<PB N="67" REF="72">
that of Henry the fifth, as de&s;cribed by
Shake&s;pear.</P>
<P>In my thirteenth year I went to Bath, where
I was fir&s;t introduced into the world as a wo|man,
having been intitled to that privilege by
my per&s;on, which was remarkably tall for my
years; and there my fancy was quite captivated
by the variety of diver&s;ions in which I was con|tinually
engaged: not that the parties were alto|gether
new to me, but becau&s;e I now found my|&s;elf
con&s;idered as a per&s;on of con&s;equence, and
&s;urrounded by a croud of admirers, who courted
my acquaintance, and fed my vanity with prai&s;e
and adulation. In &s;hort, whether or not I de|&s;erved
their encomiums, I leave the world to
judge; but my per&s;on was commended, and my
talent in dancing met with univer&s;al applau&s;e.
No wonder then, that every thing appeared joy|ous
to a young creature, who was &s;o void of ex|perience
and di&s;&s;imulation, that &s;he believed every
body's heart as &s;incere as her own, and every ob|ject
&s;uch as it appeared to be.</P>
<P>Among the &s;wains who &s;ighed, or pretended
to &s;igh for me, were two that bore a pretty equal
&s;hare of my favour; (it was too &s;uperficial to de|&s;erve
the name of love.) One of the&s;e was a for|ward
youth of &s;ixteen, extremely hand&s;ome,
lively, and impudent, who attended in quality
of page upon the prince&s;s Amelia, who &s;pent
that &s;ea&s;on at the Bath; the other was a Scotch
nobleman turned of thirty, who was graced with
a red ribbon, and danced particularly well, two
qualifications of great weight with a girl of my
age, who&s;e heart was not deeply intere&s;ted in the
cau&s;e. Neverthele&s;s, the page prevailed over
this formidable rival; though our amour went
<PB N="68" REF="73">
no farther than a little flirting, and cea&s;ed in|tirely
when I left the place.</P>
<P>Next year, however, I revi&s;ited this agreeable
&s;cene, and pa&s;&s;ed my time in the &s;ame circle of
amu&s;ements; in which, indeed, each &s;ea&s;on at
Bath is exactly re&s;embled by that which &s;ucceeds,
allowing for the difference of company, which is
continually varying. There I met with the &s;ame
incen&s;e, and again had my favourite, who was
a North Briton, and captain of foot, near forty
years of age, and a little lame, an impediment
which I did not di&s;cover, until it was pointed out
by &s;ome of my companions, who rallied me upon
my choice. He was always chearful, and very
amorous, had a good countenance and an ex|cellent
under&s;tanding, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a great deal of
art, and would have per&s;uaded me to marry him,
had I not been re&s;trained by the authority of my
father, who&s;e con&s;ent was not to be obtained in
favour of a man of his fortune.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, many propo&s;als of marriage
were made to my parents; but, as they came
from people whom I did not like, I rejected them
all, being determined to refu&s;e every man who
did not make his addre&s;&s;es to my&s;elf in per&s;on,
becau&s;e I had no notion of marrying for any
thing but love.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e formal propo&s;ers was a Scotti&s;h
earl, who&s;e preten&s;ions were broke off by &s;ome
difference about &s;ettlements; and the &s;on of an
Engli&s;h baron, with whom my father was in
treaty, when he carried me to town, on a vi&s;it
to a young lady, with whom I had been intimate
from my infancy. She was ju&s;t delivered of her
fir&s;t &s;on, for whom we &s;tood &s;pon&s;ors; &s;o that
this occa&s;ion detained us a whole month, during
<PB N="69" REF="74">
which, I went to a ball at court on the queen's
birth-day, and there, for the fir&s;t time, felt what
love and beauty were.</P>
<P>The &s;econd &s;on of duke&mdash;, who had
ju&s;t returned from his travels, was dancing with
the prince&s;s royal, when a young lady came and
de&s;ired me to go and &s;ee a &s;tranger, whom all the
world admired: upon which, I followed her into
the circle, and ob&s;erved this object of admira|tion.
He was dre&s;&s;ed in a coat of white cloth,
faced with blue &s;attin embroidered with &s;ilver, of
the &s;ame piece with his wai&s;tcoat; his fine hair
hung down his back in ringlets below his wai&s;t,
and his hat was laced with &s;ilver, and garni&s;hed
with a white feather; but his per&s;on beggared all
de&s;cription. He was tall and graceful, neither
corpulent nor meagre, his limbs finely propor|tioned,
his countenance open and maje&s;tic, his
eyes full of &s;weetne&s;s and vivacity, his teeth re|gular,
and his pouting lips of the complexion of
the dama&s;k ro&s;e. In &s;hort, he was formed for
love, and in&s;pired it wherever he appeared; nor
was he a niggard of his talents, but liberally re|turned
it; at lea&s;t what pa&s;&s;ed for &s;uch: for he
had a flow of gallantry, for which many ladies
of this land can vouch from their own expe|rience:
but he exclaimed again&s;t marriage, be|cau&s;e
he had, as yet, met with no woman, to
who&s;e charms he would &s;urrender his liberty,
though a prince&s;s of France, and a lady of the
&s;ame rank in&mdash;, were &s;aid to be, at that
time, enamoured of his per&s;on.</P>
<P>I went home, totally ingro&s;&s;ed by his idea,
flattering my&s;elf, that he had ob&s;erved me with
&s;ome attention; for I was young and new, and
<PB N="70" REF="75">
had the good fortune to attract the notice and
approbation of the queen her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Next day, being at the opera, I was agreeably
&s;urpri&s;ed with the appearance of this amiable
&s;tranger, who no &s;ooner &s;aw me enter, than he
approached &s;o near to the place where I &s;at, that
I overheard what he &s;aid to his companions;
and was &s;o happy as to find my&s;elf the &s;ubject of
his di&s;cour&s;e, which abounded with rapturous
expre&s;&s;ions of love and admiration.</P>
<P>I could not li&s;ten to the&s;e tran&s;ports without
emotion; my colour changed, my heart throbbed
with unu&s;ual violence, and mine eyes betrayed
my inclinations in &s;undry favourable glances,
which he &s;eemed to interpret aright, though he
could not then avail him&s;elf of his &s;ucce&s;s, &s;o far
as to communicate his &s;entiments by &s;peech, be|cau&s;e
we were &s;trangers to each other.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed that night in the mo&s;t anxious &s;u&s;pence,
and &s;everal days elap&s;ed, before I &s;aw him again.
At length, however, being at court on a ball|night,
and determined again&s;t dancing, I per|ceived
him among the croud, and, to my un|&s;peakable
joy, &s;aw him advance with my lord
P&mdash;, who introduced him to my acquaintance.
He &s;oon found means to alter my re&s;olution; and
I conde&s;cended to be his partner all the evening;
during which, he declared his pa&s;&s;ion in the mo&s;t
tender and per&s;ua&s;ive terms that real love could
dictate, or fruitful imagination invent.</P>
<P>I believed his prote&s;tations, becau&s;e I wi&s;hed
them true, and was an unexperienced girl of fif|teen.
I complied with his earne&s;t reque&s;t of
being permitted to vi&s;it me, and even invited
him to breakfa&s;t next morning; &s;o that you may
imagine (I &s;peak to tho&s;e that feel) I $word$ not,
<PB N="71" REF="76">
that night, enjoy much repo&s;e. Such was the
hurry and flutter of my &s;pirits, that I ro&s;e at &s;ix
to receive him at ten. I dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in a new
pink &s;attin-gown and my be&s;t laced night-cloaths,
and was &s;o animated by the occa&s;ion, that if
ever I de&s;erved a compliment upon my looks, it
was my due at this meeting.</P>
<P>The wi&s;hed-for moment came, that brought
my lover to my view: I was overwhelmed with
joy, mode&s;ty, and fear of I knew not what.
We &s;at down to breakfa&s;t, but did not eat. He
renewed his addre&s;&s;es with irre&s;i&s;tible eloquence,
and pre&s;&s;ed me to accept of his hand, without
farther he&s;itation: but, to &s;uch a precipitate &s;tep,
I objected, as a mea&s;ure repugnant to decency,
as well as to that duty which I owed to my fa|ther,
whom I tenderly loved.</P>
<P>Though I with&s;tood this premature propo&s;al,
I did not attempt to di&s;gui&s;e the &s;ituation of my
thoughts; and thus commenced a tender corre|&s;pondence,
which was maintained by letters while
I remained in the country, and carried on (when
I was in town) by private interviews, twice or
thrice a week, at the hou&s;e of my milliner, where
&s;uch endearments pa&s;&s;ed as refined and happy lo|vers
know, and others can only gue&s;s. Truth
and innocence prevailed on my &s;ide, while his
heart was fraught with &s;incerity and love. Such
frequent intercour&s;e created an intimacy which
I began to think dangerous, and therefore yielded
to his repeated de&s;ire, that we might be united
for ever: nay, I re&s;olved to avoid him, until the
day &s;hould be fixed, and very innocently (though
not very wi&s;ely) told him my rea&s;on for this
determination, which was no other than a
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my incapacity to refu&s;e him
<PB N="72" REF="77">
any thing he &s;hould demand as a te&s;timony of my
love.</P>
<P>The time was accordingly appointed, at the
di&s;tance of a few days, during which I intended
to have implored my father's con&s;ent, though I
had but faint hopes of obtaining it: but, he was
by &s;ome means or other apprized of our de&s;ign,
before I could prevail upon my&s;elf to make him
acquainted with our purpo&s;e. I had danced with
my lover at the Ridotto on the preceding even|ing,
and there, perhaps, our eyes betrayed us.
Certain it is, &s;everal of lord W&mdash;m's relations,
who di&s;approved of the match, came up and ral|lied
him on his pa&s;&s;ion; lord S&mdash;k in particu|lar,
u&s;ed this remarkable expre&s;&s;ion, &ldquo;Nephew,
as much love as you plea&s;e, but no matri|mony.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Next day, the prie&s;t being prepared, and the
bridegroom waiting for me at the appointed place,
in all the tran&s;ports of impatient expectation, I
was, without any previous warning, carried into
the country by my father, who took no notice
of the intelligence he had received, but decoyed
me into the coach, on pretence of taking the
air; and when we had proceeded as far as Turn|ham$green,
gave me to under&s;tand, that he
would dine in that place.</P>
<P>There was no remedy: I was obliged to bear
my di&s;appointment, though with an aching heart,
and followed him up &s;tairs into an apartment,
where he told me he was minutely informed of
my matrimonial &s;cheme. I did not attempt to
di&s;gui&s;e the truth, but a&s;&s;ured him, while the
tears gu&s;hed from my eyes, that my want of
courage alone had hindered me from making him
privy to my pa&s;&s;ion; though I owned, I &s;hould
<PB N="73" REF="78">
have married lord W&mdash;m, even though he
had di&s;approved of my choice. I reminded him
of the unea&s;y life I led at home, and frankly ac|knowledged,
that I loved my admirer too well
to live without him; though if he wou'd favour
me with his con&s;ent, I would defer my intention,
and punctually ob&s;erve any day he &s;hould fix for
our nuptials. Mean while, I begged he would
permit me to &s;end a me&s;&s;age to lord W&mdash;m,
who was waiting in expectation of my coming,
and might (without &s;uch notice) imagine I was
playing the jilt. He granted this la&s;t reque&s;t;
in con&s;equence of which, I &s;ent a letter to my lo|ver,
who, when he received it, had almo&s;t fainted
away, believing that I &s;hould be locked up in the
country, and &s;natched for ever from his arms.
Tortured with the&s;e apprehen&s;ions, he changed
cloaths immediately, and taking hor&s;e, re&s;olved
to follow me whither&s;oever we &s;hould go.</P>
<P>After dinner, we proceeded as far as Brent|ford,
where we lay, intending to be at my fa|ther's
country-hou&s;e next night; and my admirer
putting up at the &s;ame inn, practi&s;ed every expe|dient
his invention could &s;ugge&s;t, to procure an
interview; but all his endeavours were un&s;ucce&s;&s;|ful,
becau&s;e I, who little dream'd of his being
&s;o near, had gone to bed upon our fir&s;t arrival,
overwhelmed with affliction and tears.</P>
<P>In the morning I threw my&s;elf at my father's
feet, and conjured him by all the ties of paternal
affection, to indulge me with an opportunity of
&s;eeing my admirer once more, before I &s;hould be
conveyed from his wi&s;hes. The melancholy
condition in which I preferred this &s;upplication,
melted the tender heart of my parent, who yielded
<PB N="74" REF="79">
to my &s;olicitation, and carried me back to town,
for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Lord W&mdash;m, who had watched our mo|tions,
and arrived at his own lodgings, before
we alighted at my father's hou&s;e, obeyed my
&s;ummons on the in&s;tant, and appeared before me
like an angel. Our faculties were, for &s;ome mi|nutes,
&s;u&s;pended by a conflict of grief and joy.
At length, I recovered the u&s;e of &s;peech, and
gave him to under&s;tand, that I was come to
town, in order to take my leave of him, by the
permi&s;&s;ion of my father, whom I had promi&s;ed
to attend into the country next day, before he
would con&s;ent to my return; the chief cau&s;e and
pretence of which, was my earne&s;t de&s;ire to con|vince
him, that I was not to blame for the di&s;|appointment
he had &s;uffered, and that I &s;hould
&s;ee him again in a month, when the nuptial knot
&s;hould be tied in &s;pite of all oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>My lover, who was better acquainted with the
world, had well nigh run di&s;tracted with this in|formation.
He &s;wore he would not leave me,
until I &s;hould promi&s;e to meet and marry him next
day; or, if I refu&s;ed to grant that reque&s;t, he
would immediately leave the kingdom, to which
he would never more return; and before his de|parture,
&s;acrifice lord H&mdash;B&mdash;, &s;on to the duke
of S. A&mdash;, who was the only per&s;on upon earth
who could have betraved us to my father, be|cau&s;e
he alone was tru&s;ted with the &s;ecret of our
intended marriage, and had actually undertaken
to give me away; an office which he afterwards
declined. Lord W&mdash;m al&s;o affirmed, that
my father decoyed me into the country, with a
view of cooping me up, and $eque&s;ting me $$|tirely
from his view and corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="80">
In vain I pleaded my father's well-known ten|derne&s;s,
and u&s;ed all the arguments I could re|collect
to divert him from his revenge upon lord
H&mdash;. He was deaf to all my repre&s;entations,
and nothing, I found, would prevail upon him
to &s;uppre&s;s his re&s;entment, but a po&s;itive promi&s;e
to comply with his former de&s;ire. I told him, I
would hazard every thing to make him happy;
but could not, with any regard to my duty, take
&s;uch a &s;tep, without the knowledge of my pa|rent;
or, if I were &s;o inclined, it would be im|practicable
to elude his vigilance and &s;u&s;picion.
However, he employed &s;uch pathetic remon|&s;trances,
and retained &s;uch a powerful advocate
within my own brea&s;t, that before we parted, I
a&s;&s;ured him, my whole power &s;hould be exerted
for his &s;atisfaction; and he &s;ignified his re&s;olution
of &s;itting up all night, in expectation of &s;eeing
me at his lodgings.</P>
<P>He had no &s;ooner retired, than I went into
the next room, and de&s;ired my father to fix a
day for the marriage; in which ca&s;e, I would
cheatfully wait upon him into the country;
whereas, &s;hould he deny my reque&s;t, on pretence
of &s;taying for the con&s;ent of my lover's relations,
which was very uncertain, I would &s;eize the fir&s;t
opportunity of marrying lord W&mdash;m, co&s;t
what it would. He con&s;ented to the match, but
would not appoint a day for the ceremony, which
he propo&s;ed to defer until all parties &s;hould be
agreed; and &s;uch a favourable cri&s;is, I feared,
would never happen.</P>
<P>I therefore re&s;olved within my&s;elf to gratify
my lover's expectation, by eloping, if po&s;&s;ible,
that very night; though the execution of this
plan was extremely difficult, becau&s;e my fa$$er
<PB N="76" REF="81">
was upon the alarm, and my own maid, who
was my bedfellow, altogether in his intere&s;t.
Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e con&s;iderations, I found
means to engage one of the hou&s;e-maids in my
behalf, who be&s;poke an hackney-coach, to be
kept in waiting all night; and to bed I went with
my Abigail, whom (as I had not clo&s;ed an eye)
I waked about five in the morning, and &s;ent to
pack up &s;ome things for our intended journey.</P>
<P>While &s;he was thus employed, I got up, and
huddled on my cloaths, &s;tanding upon my pil|low,
le&s;t my father, who lay in the chamber be|low,
&s;hould hear me afoot, and &s;u&s;pect my de|&s;ign.</P>
<P>Having dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf with great di&s;patch and
di&s;order, I flounced down &s;tairs, &s;talking as hea|vily
as I could tread, that he might mi&s;take me
for one of the &s;ervants; and my confederate open|ing
the door, I &s;allied out into the &s;treet, though
I knew not which way to turn, and, to my un|&s;peakable
mortification, neither coach nor chair
appeared.</P>
<P>Having travelled on foot a good way, in hope
of finding a convenience; and being not only di&s;|appointed
in that particular, but al&s;o bewildered
in my peregrination, I began to be exceedingly
alarmed with the apprehen&s;ion of being met by
&s;ome per&s;on who might know me; becau&s;e, in
that ca&s;e, my de&s;ign would undoubtedly have
been di&s;covered, from every circum&s;tance of my
appearance at that time of day; for I had put
on the very cloaths which I had pulled off over
night, &s;o that my dre&s;s was altogether odd and
peculiar: my &s;hoes were very fine, and over a
large hoop I wore a pink &s;attin quilted petticoat
trimmed with &s;ilver, which was partly covered
<PB N="77" REF="82">
by a white dimity night-gown, a full quarter of
a yard too &s;hort: my handkerchief and apron
were hurried on without pinning; my night-cap
could not contain my hair, which hung about
my ears in great di&s;order, and my countenance
denoted a mixture of hope and fear, joy and
&s;hame.</P>
<P>In this dilemma, I made my addre&s;&s;es to that
honourable member of &s;ociety a &s;hoe-black, whom
I earne&s;tly intreated to provide me with a coach
or chair, promi&s;ing to reward him liberally for
his trouble: but he having the misfortune to be
lame, was unable to keep up with my pace; &s;o
that, by his advice and direction, I went into the
fir&s;t public-hou&s;e I found open, where I &s;tayed
&s;ome time, in the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation, among
a crew of wretches whom I thought proper to
bribe for their civility, not without the terror of
being &s;tripped. At length, however, my me&s;|&s;enger
returned with a chair, of which I took
immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and fearing that, by this
time, my family would be alarmed, and &s;end di|rectly
to lord W&mdash;m's lodgings, I ordered my|&s;elf
to be carried thither backwards, that &s;o I
might pa&s;s undi&s;covered.</P>
<P>This &s;tratagem &s;ucceeded according to my
wi&s;h; I ran up &s;tairs, in a &s;tate of trepidation,
to my faithful lover, who called an hackney|coach,
in which we went to church and were
married.</P>
<P>His fears were then all over, but mine recurred
with double aggravation: I dreaded the &s;ight of
my father, and &s;hared all the &s;orrow he &s;uffered on
account of my undutiful behaviour: for I loved
him with &s;uch piety of affection, that I would
have endured every other &s;pecies of di&s;tre&s;s, rather
<PB N="78" REF="83">
than have given him the lea&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s: but
love (where he reigns in full empire) is altoge|ther
irre&s;i&s;tible, &s;urmounts every difficulty, and
&s;wallows up all other con&s;iderations. This was
the ca&s;e with me; and now the irrevocable &s;tep
was taken, my fir&s;t care was to avoid his &s;ight.
With this view, I begged that lord W&mdash;m
would think of &s;ome remote place in the coun|try,
to which we might retire for the pre&s;ent;
and he forthwith conducted me to an hou&s;e on
Blackheath, where we were very civilly received
by a laughter-loving dame, who &s;eemed to mi|&s;take
me for one of her own &s;i&s;terhood.</P>
<P>I no &s;ooner perceived her opinion, than I de|&s;ired
lord W&mdash;m to undeceive her; upon
which &s;he was made acquainted with the predica|ment
in which I &s;tood, and &s;hewed us into a pri|vate
room, where I called for pen and paper, and
wrote an apology to my father, for having acted
contrary to his will, in &s;o important a concern.</P>
<P>This ta&s;k being performed, the bridegroom
gave me to under&s;tand, that there was a nece&s;&s;ity
for our being bedded immediately, in order to
render the marriage binding, le&s;t my father &s;hould
di&s;cover and part us before con&s;ummation. I
pleaded hard for a re&s;pite till the evening, ob|jecting
to the indecency of going to bed before
noon; but he found means to invalidate all my
arguments, and to convince me, that it was now
my duty to obey. Rather than hazard the im|putation
of being ob&s;tinate and refractory on the
fir&s;t day of my probation, I &s;uffered my&s;elf to be
led into a chamber, which was darkened by my
expre&s;s &s;tipulation, that my &s;hame and confu&s;ion
might be the better concealed, and yielded to the
<PB N="79" REF="84">
privilege of a dear hu&s;band, who loved me to
adoration.</P>
<P>About five o'clock in the afternoon we were
called to dinner, which we had ordered to be
ready at four; but &s;uch a paultry care had been
forgot, amid&s;t the tran&s;ports of our mutual bli&s;s.
We got up, however, and when we came down
&s;tairs, I was a&s;hamed to &s;ee the light of day, or
meet the eyes of my beloved lord. I ate little,
&s;aid le&s;s, was happy, though overwhelmed with
confu&s;ion, underwent a thou&s;and agitations, &s;ome
of which were painful, but by far the greater
part belonged to rapture and delight; we were
imparadi&s;ed in the gratification of our mutual
wi&s;hes, and felt all that love can be&s;tow, and &s;en|&s;ibility
enjoy.</P>
<P>In the twilight, we returned to lord W&mdash;m's
lodgings in town, where I received a letter from
my father, importing, that he would never &s;ee
me again. But there was one circum&s;tance in his
manner of writing, from which I conceived an
happy pre&s;age of his future indulgence. He had
begun with his u&s;ual appellation of <HI>Dear Fanny,</HI>
which, though it was expunged to make way for
the word <HI>Madam,</HI> encouraged me to hope that
his paternal fondne&s;s was not yet extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>At &s;upper, we were vi&s;ited by lord W&mdash;m's
younge&s;t &s;i&s;ter, who laughed at us for our incon|&s;iderate
match, though, &s;he owned, &s;he envied
our happine&s;s, and offered me the u&s;e of her
cloaths, until I could retrieve my own. She
was a woman of a great deal of humour, plain
but genteel, civil, friendly, and perfectly well|bred.
She favoured us with her company till the
night was pretty far advanced, and did not take
her leave till we retired to our apartment.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="85">
As our lodgings were not &s;pacious or magni|ficent,
we re&s;olved to &s;ee little company; but
this re&s;olution was fru&s;trated by the numerous ac|quaintance
of lord W&mdash;m, who let in half the
town; &s;o that I ran the gauntlet for a whole
week among a &s;et of wits, who always delight
in teazing a young creature of any note, when
&s;he happens to make &s;uch a &s;tolen match. Among
tho&s;e that vi&s;ited us upon this occa&s;ion, was my
lord's younger brother, who was at that time in
keeping with a rich heire&s;s of ma&s;culine memory,
and took that opportunity of making a parade
with his equipage, which was indeed very mag|nificent,
but altogether di&s;regarded by us, who&s;e
happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ted in the opulence of mutual
love.</P>
<P>This ceremony of receiving vi&s;its being per|formed,
we went to wait on his mother the du|che&s;s
of H&mdash;, who hearing I was an heire&s;s,
readily forgave her &s;on for marrying without her
knowledge and con&s;ent, and favoured us with a
very cordial reception; in&s;omuch that, for &s;everal
months, we dined almo&s;t con&s;tantly at her table;
and I mu&s;t own, I always found her unaltered in
her civility and affection, contrary to her general
character, which was haughty and capricious.
She was undoubtedly a woman of great &s;pirit
and under&s;tanding, but &s;ubject to an infirmity
which very much impairs and di&s;gui&s;es every other
qualification.</P>
<P>In about three weeks after our marriage, I was
&s;o happy as to obtain the forgivene&s;s of my fa|ther,
to who&s;e hou&s;e we repaired, in order to pay
our re&s;pects and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. At &s;ight of me he
wept; nor did I behold his tears unmoved: my
heart was over-charged with tenderne&s;s and &s;or|row,
<PB N="81" REF="86">
for having offended &s;uch an indulgent pa|rent;
&s;o that I mingled my tears with his, while
my dear hu&s;band, who&s;e &s;oul was of the &s;ofte&s;t
and gentle&s;t mould, melted with &s;ympathy at the
affecting &s;cene.</P>
<P>Being thus reconciled to my father, we at|tended
him into the country, where we were re|ceived
by my mother, who was a &s;en&s;ible good
woman, though not &s;u&s;ceptible of love, and there|fore
le&s;s apt to excu&s;e a weakne&s;s, to which &s;he
was an utter &s;tranger. This was likewi&s;e the
ca&s;e with an uncle, from whom I had great ex|pectations.
He was a plain good-natured man,
and treated us with great courte&s;y; though his
notions, in point of love, were not exactly con|formable
to ours. Neverthele&s;s, I was, and
&s;eemed to be &s;o happy in my choice, that my fa|mily
not only became &s;atisfied with the match,
but exceedingly fond of lord W&mdash;m.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort &s;tay with them in the country,
we returned to London, in order to be introduced
at court, and then &s;et out for the North, on a
vi&s;it to my brother-in-law the duke of H&mdash;,
who had, by a letter to lord W&mdash;m, invited
us to his habitation. My father accordingly
equipped us with hor&s;es and money; for our own
finances were extremely &s;lender, con&s;i&s;ting only
of a &s;mall pen&s;ion allowed by his grace, upon
whom the brothers were intirely dependent, the
father having died &s;uddenly, before &s;uitable pro|vi&s;ion
could be made for his younger children.</P>
<P>When I took my leave of my relations, bid|ding
adieu to my paternal home, and found my|&s;elf
launching into a world of care and trouble,
though the voyage on which I had embarked was
altogether voluntary, and my companion the per|&s;on
<PB N="82" REF="87">
on whom I doated to di&s;traction, I could not
help feeling &s;ome melancholy &s;en&s;ations, which,
however, in a little time, gave way to a train of
more agreeable ideas. I was vi&s;ited in town by
almo&s;t all the women of fa&s;hion, many of whom,
I perceived, envied me the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a man
who had made &s;trange havock among their hearts,
and &s;ome of them knew the value of his favour.
One in particular endeavoured to cultivate my
friend&s;hip with &s;ingular marks of regard; but I
thought proper to di&s;courage her advances, by
keeping within the bounds of bare civility; and
indeed, to none of them was I lavi&s;h of my com|plai&s;ance;
for I dedicated my whole time to the
object of my affection, who engro&s;&s;ed my wi&s;hes
to &s;uch a degree, that although I was never jea|lous
(becau&s;e I had no rea&s;on to be &s;o) I envied
the happine&s;s of every woman whom he chanced
at any time to hand into a coach.</P>
<P>The duche&s;s of&mdash;, who was newly
married to the earl of P&mdash;, a particular friend
of lord W&mdash;m's, carried me to court, and
pre&s;ented me to the queen, who expre&s;&s;ed her ap|probation
of my per&s;on in very particular terms,
and ob&s;erved the &s;atisfaction that appeared in my
countenance with marks of admiration; de&s;iring
her ladies to take notice, how little happine&s;s de|pended
upon wealth, &s;ince there was more joy
in my face than in all her court be&s;ide.</P>
<P>Such a declaration could not fail to overwhelm
me with blu&s;hes, which her maje&s;ty &s;eemed to
behold with plea&s;ure; for &s;he frequently repeated
the remark, and &s;hewed me to all the foreigners
of di&s;tinction, with many gracious expre&s;&s;ions of
favour. She wi&s;hed lord W&mdash;m happine&s;s in|&s;tead
of joy, and was plea&s;ed to promi&s;e, that &s;he
<PB N="83" REF="88">
would provide for her pretty beggars: and poor
enough we certainly were in every article but
love. Neverthele&s;s, we felt no nece&s;&s;ities, but
pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ummer in a variety of plea&s;ures and
parties, the greate&s;t part of which were planned
by lord W&mdash;m's &s;i&s;ter and another lady, who
was at that time mi&s;tre&s;s to the prime mini&s;ter.
The fir&s;t was a wit, but homely in her per&s;on;
the other, a woman of great beauty and ma&s;cu|line
under&s;tanding; and a particular friend&s;hip
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them, though they were both
lovers of power and admiration.</P>
<P>This lady, who &s;at at the helm, was ex|tremely
elegant as well as expen&s;ive in her diver|&s;ions,
in many of which we bore a &s;hare; parti|cularly
in her parties upon the water, which
were contrived in all the magnificence of ta&s;te.
In the cour&s;e of the&s;e amu&s;ements, a trifling cir|cum&s;tance
occurred, which I &s;hall relate as an
in&s;tance of that jealous &s;en&s;ibility which charac|teri&s;ed
lord W&mdash;'s di&s;po&s;ition. A large com|pany
of ladies and gentlemen having agreed to
dine at Vauxhall, and &s;up at Marblehall, where
we propo&s;ed to conclude the evening with a
dance, one barge being in&s;ufficient to contain the
whole company, we were divided by lots; in
con&s;equence of which, my hu&s;band and I were
parted. This &s;eparation was equally mortifying
to us both, who, though married, were &s;till lo|vers;
and my chagrin was increa&s;ed, when I
perceived that I was doomed to &s;it by Sir W&mdash;
Y&mdash;, a man of profe&s;&s;ed gallantry: for, al|though
lord W&mdash;m had, before his marriage,
made his addre&s;&s;es to every woman he &s;aw, I
knew very well he did not de&s;ire that any per|&s;on
&s;hould make love to his wife.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="89">
That I might not therefore give umbrage,
by talking to this gallant, I conver&s;ed with a
Scotch nobleman, who, according to common
report, had formerly &s;ighed among my ad|mirers:
by the&s;e means, in &s;eeking to avoid one
error, I unwittingly plunged my&s;elf into a
greater; and di&s;obliged Lord W&mdash;m &s;o much,
that he could not conceal his di&s;plea&s;ure; nay,
&s;o deeply was he offended at my conduct, that
in the evening, when the ball began, he would
&s;carce deign to take me by the hand in the cour&s;e
of dancing, and darted &s;uch unkind looks as
pierced me to the very &s;oul; and what augment|ed
my concern, was my ignorance of the tre&s;pa&s;s
I had committed. I was tortured with a thou|&s;and
unea&s;y reflections; I began to fear that I
had mi&s;taken his temper, and given my heart to
a man who was tired of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; tho' I re|&s;olved
to bear without complaining the misfor|tune
I had entailed upon my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I &s;eized the fir&s;t opportunity of &s;peaking to
him, and thereby di&s;covered the cau&s;e of his
chagrin; but, as there was no time for expo&s;tu|lation,
the mi&s;under&s;tanding continued on his
&s;ide, with &s;uch evident marks of unea&s;ine&s;s, that
every individual of the company made up to
me, and inquired about the cau&s;e of his di&s;order;
&s;o that I was fain to amu&s;e their concern, by
&s;aying that he had been ill the day before, and
dancing did not agree with his con&s;titution. So
much was he incen&s;ed by this unhappy circum|&s;tance
of my conduct, which was void of all in|tention
to offend him, that he determined to be
revenged of me, for my indi&s;cretion, and at &s;up|per,
chancing to &s;it between two very hand&s;ome
ladies, (one of whom is lately dead, and the o|ther,
<PB N="85" REF="90">
at pre&s;ent, my neighbour in the country)
he affected an air of gaiety, and openly coquetted
with them both.</P>
<P>This was not the only puni&s;hment he inflicted
on his innocent wife. In the cour&s;e of our en|tertainment,
we engaged in &s;ome &s;imple diver|&s;ion,
in con&s;equence of which, the gentlemen
were ordered to &s;alute the ladies; when Lord
W&mdash;m, in performing this command, unkind|ly
neglected me in my turn; and I had occa&s;ion
for all my di&s;cretion and pride, to conceal from
the company the agonies I felt at this mark of
indifference and di&s;re&s;pect. However, I obtained
the victory over my&s;elf, and pretended to laugh
at his hu&s;band-like behaviour, while the tears
&s;tood in my eyes, and my heart &s;welled even to
bur&s;ting.</P>
<P>We broke up about five, after having &s;pent
the mo&s;t tedious evening I had ever known; and
this offended lover went to bed in a &s;tate of &s;ullen
&s;ilence and di&s;gu&s;t. Whatever de&s;ire I had to
come to an explanation, I thought my&s;elf &s;o
much aggrieved by his unrea&s;onable prejudice,
that I could not prevail upon my&s;elf to demand a
conterence, till after his fir&s;t nap, when my pride
giving way to my tenderne&s;s, I cla&s;ped him in
my arms, though he pretended to di&s;courage
the&s;e advances of my love: I a&s;ked how he could
be &s;o unju&s;t as to take umbrage at my civility to
a man whom, he knew, I had refu&s;ed for his
&s;ake. I chid him for his barbarous endeavours
to awake my jealou&s;y, and u&s;ed &s;uch irre|&s;i&s;tible
arguments in my own vindication, that
he was convinced of my innocence, &s;ealed my
acqu$ttal with a kind embrace, and we mutually
<PB N="86" REF="91">
enjoyed the &s;oft tran&s;ports of a fond reconci|liation.</P>
<P>Never was pa&s;&s;ion more eager, delicate, or
unre&s;erved, than that which glowed within our
brea&s;ts. Far from being cloyed with the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of each other, our raptures &s;eemed to in|crea&s;e
with the term of our union. When we
were parted, though but for a few hours, by the
nece&s;&s;ary avocations of life, we were unhappy
during that brief &s;eparation, and met again, like
lovers who knew no joy but in one another's
pre&s;ence. How many delicious evenings did we
&s;pend together, in our own little apartment, after
we had ordered the candles to be taken away,
that we might enjoy the agreeable reflection of the
moon, in a fine &s;ummer's evening. Such a mil$$
and &s;olemn &s;cene naturally di&s;po&s;es the mind to
peace and benevolence; but when improved with
the conver&s;ation of the man one loves, it fills the
imagination with ideas of ineffable delight! For
my own part, I can &s;afely &s;ay, my heart was $word$
wholly ingro&s;&s;ed by my hu&s;band, that I never
took plea&s;ure in any diver&s;ion, where he was
not per&s;onally concerned; nor was I ever guilty
of one thought repugnant to my duty and my
love.</P>
<P>In the autumn we &s;et out for the north, and
were met on the road by the duke and twenty
gentlemen, who conducted us to H&mdash;n, where
we lived in all imaginable &s;plendor. His grace, $word$
that time, maintained above an hundred &s;ervants
with a band of mu&s;ic, which always performes
at dinner, kept open table, and was vi&s;ited by a
great deal of company. The oeconomy of his
hou&s;e was &s;uperintended by his elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, a
beautiful young lady of an amiable temper, with
<PB N="87" REF="92">
whom I &s;oon contracted an intimate friend&s;hip&punc;
She and the duke u&s;ed to rally me upon my &s;ond|ne&s;s
for lord W&mdash;m, who was a &s;ort of an
humouri&s;t, and apt to be in a pet, in which ca&s;e
he would leave the company, and go to bed by
&s;even o'clock in the evening. On the&s;e occa&s;ions
I always di&s;appeared, giving up every con&s;idera|tion
to that of plea&s;ing my hu&s;band, notwith&s;tand|ing
the ridicule of his relations, who taxed me
with having &s;poiled him with too much indul|gence.
But how could I expre&s;s too much
tenderne&s;s and conde&s;cen&s;ion for a man, who
doated upon me to &s;uch exce&s;s, that when bu&s;i|ne&s;s
obliged him to leave me, he always &s;natched
the fir&s;t opportunity to return, and often rode
through darkne&s;s, &s;torms and tempe&s;ts to my
arms.</P>
<P>Having &s;tayed about &s;even months in this
place, I found my&s;elf in a fair way of being a
mother; and that I might be near my own re|lations,
in &s;uch an intere&s;ting &s;ituation, I and my
dear companion departed from H&mdash;n, not with|out
great reluctance; for I was fond of the Scots
in general, who treated me with great ho&s;pitality
and re&s;pect; and to this day, they pay me the
compliment of &s;aying, I was one of the be&s;t
wives in that country, which is &s;o ju&s;tly cele|brated
for good women.</P>
<P>Lord W&mdash;m having attended me to my fa|ther's
hou&s;e, was obliged to return to Scotland,
to &s;upport his intere&s;t in being elected member
of parliament; &s;o that he took his leave of me,
with a full re&s;olution of &s;eeing me again, before
the time of my lying-inn; and all the comfort I
enjoyed in his ab&s;ence, was the peru&s;al of his
$word$ which I punctually received, together
<PB N="88" REF="93">
with tho&s;e of his &s;i&s;ter, who, from time to time,
favoured me with a&s;&s;urances of his con&s;tancy and
devotion. Indeed the&s;e te&s;timonials were nece&s;|&s;ary
to one of my di&s;po&s;ition; for I was none of
tho&s;e who could be contented with half an heart.
I could not even &s;pare one complacent look to any
other woman, but expected the undivided homage
of his love. Had I been di&s;appointed in this ex|pectation,
I &s;hould (though a wife) have re|belled
or died.</P>
<P>Mean while, my parents treated me with great
tenderne&s;s, intending that lord W&mdash;m &s;hould
be &s;ettled in a hou&s;e of his own, and accommo|dated
with my fortune; and his expectations from
the queen were very &s;anguine, when I was ta|ken
ill, and delivered of a dead child: an event
which affected me &s;o much, that when I under|&s;tood
the extent of my misfortune, my heart
throbbed with &s;uch violence, that my brea&s;t
could &s;carce contain it; and my anxiety being ag|gravated
by the ab&s;ence of my lord, produced a
dangerous fever, of which he was no &s;ooner ap|prized
by letter, than he came po&s;t from Scot|land;
but before his arrival, I was &s;uppo&s;ed to be
in a fair way.</P>
<P>During this journey, he was tortured with
all that terrible &s;u&s;pence which prevails in the
minds of tho&s;e who are in danger of lo&s;ing that
which is mo&s;t dear to them; and when he en|tered
the hou&s;e, was &s;o much overwhelmed with
apprehen&s;ion, that he dur&s;t not inquire about the
&s;tate of my health.</P>
<P>As for my part, I never clo&s;ed an eye from
the time on which I expected his return; and
when I heard his voice, threw open my curtains,
and &s;at up in the bed to receive him, though at
<PB N="89" REF="94">
the hazard of my life. He ran towards me with
all the eagerne&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion, and cla&s;p'd me in his
arms; he kneeled by my bed-&s;ide, ki&s;&s;ed my hand
a thou&s;and times, and wept with tran&s;ports of
tenderne&s;s and joy. In &s;hort, this meeting was
&s;o pathetic, as to overcome my enfeebled con&s;ti|tution;
and we were parted by tho&s;e who were
wi&s;er than our&s;elves, and &s;aw that nothing was
&s;o proper for us as a little repo&s;e.</P>
<P>But how &s;hall I relate the deplorable tran&s;ition
from envied happine&s;s to exce&s;s of mi&s;ery, which I
now &s;u&s;tained! My month was hardly up, when my
dear hu&s;band was taken ill: perhaps the fatigue of
body as well as mind, which he had undergone on
my account, occa&s;ioned a fatal ferment in his blood,
and his health fell a &s;acrifice to his love. Phy&s;i|cians
were called from London; but alas! they
brought no hopes of his recovery. By their ad|vice,
he was removed to town, for the con|venience
of being punctually attended. Every
moment was too precious to be thrown away;
he was therefore immediately put into the coach,
though the day was far &s;pent; and I, though ex|ceedingly
weak, accompanied him in the journey,
which was performed by the light of flambeaus,
and rendered un&s;peakably &s;hocking, by the di&s;mal
apprehen&s;ion of lo&s;ing him every moment.</P>
<P>At length, however, we arrived at our lodgings
in Pall-mall, where I lay by him on the floor,
and attended the i&s;&s;ue of his di&s;temper, in all the
agonies of horror and de&s;pair. In a little time
his malady &s;ettled upon his brain, and in his deli|rium,
he uttered &s;uch dreadful exclamations, as
were &s;ufficient to pierce the mo&s;t &s;avage heart.
What effect then mu&s;t they have had on mine,
which was fraught with every &s;entiment of the
<PB N="90" REF="95">
mo&s;t melting affection! It was not a common
grief that took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my &s;oul; I felt all
the aggravation of the mo&s;t acute di&s;tre&s;s. I
&s;ometimes ran down to the &s;treet in a fit of di|&s;traction:
I &s;ent for the doctors every minute:
I wearied heaven with my prayers; even now
my heart akes at the remembrance of what I &s;uf|fered,
and I cannot without trembling proceed
with the woeful &s;tory.</P>
<P>After having lain in&s;en&s;ible &s;ome days, he re|covered
the u&s;e of &s;peech, and called upon my
name, which he had a thou&s;and times repeated,
while he was bereft of rea&s;on. All hopes of has
life were now relinqui&s;hed, and I was led to
bed-&s;ide to receive his la&s;t adieu, being direct$$$
to &s;ummon all my fortitude, and &s;uppre&s;s my &s;or|row,
that he might not be di&s;turbed by my agi|tation.
I collected all my re&s;olution to &s;upport
the in this affecting &s;cene: I &s;aw my dear lord $word$
extremity; the beauties of his youth were all $word$
cayed, yet his eyes, though languid, retained un|&s;peakable
&s;weetne&s;s and expre&s;&s;ion. He felt his
end approaching, put forth his hand, and within
look full of complacency and benevolence, ut|tered
&s;uch a tender tale&mdash;Good heaven! how
had I de&s;erved &s;uch accumulated affliction! the
bare remembrance of which now melts me in$|tears.
Human nature could not undergo my &s;|tuation,
without &s;uffering an exta&s;y of grief! $
cla&s;ped him in my arms, and ki&s;&s;ed him a thou|&s;and
times, with the mo&s;t violent emotions $word$
woe: but I was torn from his embrace, and in
little time he was ravi&s;hed for ever from m$
view.</P>
<P>On that fatal morning, which put a period $word$
has life, I &s;aw the duche&s;s of L&mdash;approach $word$
<PB N="91" REF="96">
bed, and, from her appearance, concluded that
he was no more; yet I begg'd &s;he would not
confirm the unhappy pre&s;age, by announcing his
death; and &s;he accordingly pre&s;erved the mo&s;t
emphatic &s;ilence. I got up, and trod &s;oftly over
his head, as if I had been afraid of interrupting
his repo&s;e. Alas! he was no longer &s;en&s;ible of
&s;uch di&s;turbance. I was &s;eized with a &s;tupifica|tion
of &s;orrow: I threw up the window, and
looking around, thought the &s;un &s;hone with the
mo&s;t di&s;mal a&s;pect; every thing was &s;olitary,
chearle&s;s, and replete with horror.</P>
<P>In this condition I was, by the direction of
my friend, conveyed to her hou&s;e, where my fa|culties
were &s;o overpowered by the load of an|gui&s;h
which oppre&s;&s;ed me, that I know not what
pa&s;&s;ed during the fir&s;t days of my unhappy wi|dowhood:
this only I know, the kind duche&s;s
treated me with all imaginable care and compa&s;|&s;ion,
and carried me to her country-hou&s;e,
where I &s;tayed &s;ome months; during which, &s;he
endeavoured to comfort me with all the amu&s;e|ments
&s;he could invent, and laid me under &s;uch
obligations, as &s;hall never be era&s;ed from my re|membrance:
yet, notwith&s;tanding all her care
and concern, I was, by my exce&s;s of grief,
plunged into a langui&s;hing di&s;temper, for which
my phy&s;icians advi&s;ed me to drink the Bath
waters.</P>
<P>In compliance with this pre&s;cription, I went
thither towards the end of &s;ummer, and found
&s;ome benefit by adhering to their directions;
though I &s;eldom went abroad, except when I vi|&s;ited
my &s;i&s;ter-in-law, who was there with the
prince&s;s; and upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, I never failed
to attract the notice of the company, who were
<PB N="92" REF="97">
&s;truck with the appearance of &s;uch a young crea|ture
in weeds. Nor was I free from the per&s;ecu|tion
of profe&s;&s;ed admirers; but being dead to $word$
joy, I was deaf to the voice of adulation.</P>
<P>About Chri&s;tmas, I repaired to my father's
hou&s;e, where my &s;orrows were revived by every
object that recalled the idea of my dear lamented
lord. But the&s;e melancholy reflections I was ob|liged
to bear, becau&s;e I had no other home or ha|bitation,
being le&s;t an unprovided widow, altoge|ther
dependant on the affection of my own family.</P>
<P>During this winter, divers overtures were made
to my father, by people who demanded me in
marriage; but my heart was not yet &s;ufficiently
weaned from my former pa&s;&s;ion, to admit the
thoughts of another ma&s;ter. Among tho&s;e the$
pre&s;ented their propo&s;als, was a certain young
nobleman, who upon the fir&s;t news of $word$
W&mdash;m's death, came po&s;t from Paris, in or|der
to declare his pa&s;&s;ion. He made his fir&s;t ap|pearance
in a hired chariot and &s;ix, accompanies
by a big fat fellow, whom (as I afterwards
learn'd) he had engaged to &s;ound his prai&s;es, with
the promi&s;e of a thou&s;and pounds, in lieu $word$
which he paid him with forty. Whether it was
with a view of &s;creening him&s;elf from the col$$
or of making a comfortable medium in ca&s;e of
being overturned, and falling under his weight$
companion, I know not; but certain it is, th$$
carriage was &s;tuffed with hay, in &s;uch a manner
that when he arrived, the &s;ervants were at &s;ome
pains in rummaging and removing it, before they
could come at their ma&s;ter, or help him to alight
When he was lifted out of the chariot, he ex|hibited
a very ludicrous figure to the view: $word$
was a thin, meagre, &s;hivering creature, of a lo$
<PB N="93" REF="98">
&s;tature, with little black eyes, a long no&s;e, &s;al|low
complexion, and pitted with the &s;mall pox,
dre&s;&s;ed in a coat of light brown frize, lined with
pink-coloured &s;hag, a mon&s;trous &s;olitaire and
bag, and (if I remember aright) a pair of huge
jack-boots. In a word, his whole appearance
was &s;o little calculated for in&s;piring love, that I
had (on the &s;trength of &s;eeing him once before
at Oxford) &s;et him down as the la&s;t man on
earth, whom I would chu&s;e to wed; and I will
venture to affirm, that he was, in every parti|cular,
the very rever&s;e of my late hu&s;band.</P>
<P>As my father was not at home, he &s;tayed but
one evening, and left his errand with my mother,
to whom he was as di&s;agreeable as to my&s;elf; &s;o
that his propo&s;al was ab&s;olutely rejected; and
I heard no more of him during the &s;pace of
three whole months, at the expiration of which,
I went to town, where this mortifying figure
pre&s;ented it&s;elf again, and renewed his &s;uit, of|fering
&s;uch advantageous terms of &s;ettlement,
that my father began to reli&s;h the match, and
warmly recommended it to my con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Lord W&mdash;m's relations advi&s;ed me to embrace
the opportunity of making my&s;elf independent;
all my acquaintance plied me with with argu|ments
to the &s;ame purpo&s;e: I was unea&s;y at
home, and indifferent to all mankind. I weighed
the motives with the objections, and with reluc|tance
yielded to the importunity of my friends.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this determination, the little
gentleman was permitted to vi&s;it me; and the
manner of his addre&s;s did not at all alter the
opinion I had conceived of his character and un|der&s;tanding.
I was even &s;hocked at the pro&s;pect
of marrying a man whom I could not love; and,
<PB N="94" REF="99">
in order to di&s;burthen my own con&s;cience, took
an opportunity of telling him one evening, as
we &s;at oppo&s;ite to each other, that it was not in
my power to command my affection, and there|fore
he could not expect the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my
heart, lord W&mdash;m's indulgence having &s;poiled
me for a wife. Neverthele&s;s, I would endeavour
to contract a friend&s;hip for him, which would in|tirely
depend upon his own behaviour.</P>
<P>To this declaration he replied (to my great
&s;urprize) that he did not de&s;ire me to love him,
my friend&s;hip was &s;ufficient; and next day,
repeated this &s;trange in&s;tance of moderation in a
letter, which I communicated to my &s;i&s;ter, who
laughed heartily at the contents, and per&s;uaded
me, that &s;ince I could love no man, he was the
propere&s;t per&s;on to be my hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Accordingly, the wedding cloaths and equipage
being prepared, the day&mdash;<HI>the fatal day was fixed!</HI>
on the morning of which, I went to the hou&s;e of
my brother-in-law duke H&mdash;, who loved me
tenderly, and took my leave of the family; a
family which I &s;hall always remember with love,
honour, and e&s;teem. His grace received me in
the mo&s;t affectionate manner, &s;aying at parting,
&ldquo;Lady W&mdash;m, if he does not u&s;e you well,
I will take you back again.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The bridegroom and I met at Ox&mdash;chapel,
where the ceremony was performed by the bi&s;hop
of W&mdash;, in pre&s;ence of his mother, my fa|ther,
and another lady; and the nuptial knot
being tied, we &s;et out for my father's hou&s;e in
the country, and proceeded full twenty miles on
car journey, before my lord opened his mouth;
my though$s having been all that time employed
on &s;omething quite foreign to my pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion;
<PB N="95" REF="100">
for I was then but a giddy girl of eighteen.
At length my father broke &s;ilence, and clapping
his lord&s;hip on the &s;houlder, told him he was but
a dull bridegroom; upon which, my lord gave
him to under&s;tand, that he was out of &s;pirits.
This dejection continued all the day, notwith|&s;tanding
the refre&s;hment of a plentiful dinner,
which he ate upon the road; and in the evening we
arrived at the place of de&s;tination, where we were
kindly received by my mother, though &s;he had
no liking to the match; and after &s;upper, we re|tired
to our apartment.</P>
<P>It was here that I had occa&s;ion to perceive the
mo&s;t di&s;agreeable contra&s;t between my pre&s;ent
help-mate and my former lord: in&s;tead of flying to
my arms with all the eagerne&s;s of love and rap|ture,
this manly repre&s;entative &s;at moping in a
corner, like a criminal on execution-day, and
owned he was a&s;hamed to bed a woman, who&s;e
hand he had &s;carce ever touched.</P>
<P>I could not help being affected with this pu&s;ilani|mous
behaviour: I remembered lord W&mdash;m,
while I &s;urveyed the object before me, and made
&s;uch a compari&s;on as filled me with horror and
di&s;gu&s;t: nay, to &s;uch a degree did my aver&s;ion
to this phantom prevail, that I began to &s;weat
with angui&s;h at the thought of being &s;ubjected to
his plea&s;ure: and when, after a long he&s;itation,
he vertured to approach me, I trembled as if I
had been expo&s;ed to the embraces of a rattle|&s;nake.
Nor did the efforts of his love dimini&s;h
this antipathy; his attempts were like the pawings
of an imp, &s;ent from hell to teize and torment
&s;ome guilty wretch, &s;uch as are exhibited in
&s;ome dramatic performance, which I never &s;ee
acted, without remembering my wedding-night.
<PB N="96" REF="101">
By &s;uch &s;hadowy, un&s;ub&s;tantial, vexatious beha|viour,
was I tantalized, and robb'd of my re|po&s;e;
and early next morning I got up, with a
mo&s;t &s;overeign contempt for my bedfellow, who
indulged him&s;elf in bed till eleven.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed a few days in this place, I went
home with him to his hou&s;e at Twickenham;
and &s;oon after we were pre&s;ented at court, when
the queen was plea&s;ed to &s;ay to my lord's mo|ther,
&s;he did not doubt that we &s;hould be an hap|py
couple, for I had been a good wife to my for|mer
husband.</P>
<P>Whatever deficiencies I had to complain of in
my new &s;pou&s;e, he was not wanting in point of
liberality: I was pre&s;ented with a very fine cha|riot
&s;tudded with &s;ilver nails, and &s;uch a profu|&s;ion
of jewels as furni&s;hed a joke to &s;ome of my
acquaintance, who ob&s;erved that I was formerly
queen of hearts, but now metamorpho&s;ed into
the queen of diamonds. This uncommon &s;plen|dour
attracted the eyes and envy of my competi|tors,
who were the more implacable in their re|&s;entments,
becau&s;e, notwith&s;tanding my mar|riage,
I was as much as ever followed by the men
of gallantry and plea&s;ure, among whom it is a
con&s;tant maxim, that a woman never with-holds
her affections from her husband, without an in|tention
to be&s;tow them &s;omewhere el&s;e. I never
appeared without a train of admirers, and my
hou&s;e in the country was always crouded with
gay young men of quality.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e who cultivated my good graces
with the greate&s;t &s;kill and a&s;&s;iduity, were the earl
C&mdash;, and Mr. S&mdash;, brother to lord F&mdash;.
The former of whom, in the cour&s;e of his ad|dre&s;&s;es,
treated me with an entertainment of &s;ur|pri&s;ing
<PB N="97" REF="102">
magnificence, di&s;po&s;ed into a dinner, &s;up|per,
and ball; to which I, at his de&s;ire, invited
eleven ladies, whom he paired with the like num|ber
of his own &s;ex: &s;o that the whole company
amounted to twenty-four. We were regaled
with a mo&s;t elegant dinner, in an apartment
which was altogether &s;uperb, and &s;erved by
gentlemen only, no livery-&s;ervant being permit|ed
to come within the door. In the afternoon
we embarked in two &s;plendid barges, being at|tended
by a band of mu&s;ick, in a third; and en|joyed
a delightful evening upon the river, till the
twilight, when we returned, and began the ball,
which was conducted with &s;uch order and ta&s;te,
that mirth and good humour prevailed, and no
di&s;&s;atis&s;action appeared, except in the countenance
of one old maid, &s;ince married to a &s;on of the
duke of&mdash;, who, tho' &s;he would not refu&s;e to
partake of &s;uch an agreeable entertainment, was
di&s;plea&s;ed that I &s;hould have the honour of invit|ing
her. O baleful Envy! thou &s;elf-tormenting
fiend! How do'&s;t thou predominate in all a&s;&s;em|blies,
from the grand gala of a court to the meet|ing
of &s;imple pea&s;ants at their harve&s;t-home! Nor
is the prevalence of this &s;ordid pa&s;&s;ion to be won|dered
at, if we con&s;ider the weakne&s;s, pride, and
vanity of our &s;ex. The pre&s;ence of one favourite
man &s;hall poi&s;on the enjoyment of a whole com|pany,
and produce the mo&s;t rancorous enmity
betwixt the clo&s;e&s;t friends.</P>
<P>I danced with the ma&s;ter of the ball, who em|ployed
all the artillery of his eloquence in making
love; yet I did not li&s;ten to his addre&s;&s;es, for he
was not to my ta&s;te, tho' he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an agree|able
per&s;on, and a good acquired under&s;tanding;
but he was utterly ignorant of that gentle prevail|ing
<PB N="98" REF="103">
art which I afterwards experienced in Mr.
S&mdash;, and which was the only method he could
have &s;ucce&s;sfully practi&s;ed, in &s;educing a young
woman like me, born with &s;entiments of ho|nour,
and trained up in the paths of religion and
virtue. He was, indeed, ab&s;olutely ma&s;ter of
tho&s;e in&s;inuating qualifications which few wo|men
of pa&s;&s;ion and &s;en&s;ibility can re&s;i&s;t; and had
a per&s;on every way adapted for profiting by the&s;e
in&s;idious talents. He was well acquainted with
the human heart, con&s;cious of his own power and
capacity, and exerci&s;ed the&s;e endowments with
unwearied per&s;everance. He was tall and thin,
which was perfectly agreeable to my ta&s;te, with
large blue eloquent eyes, good teeth, and a long
head turned to gallantry. His behaviour was the
&s;tandard of politene&s;s, and all his advances were
conducted with the mo&s;t profound re&s;pect; which
is the mo&s;t effectual expedient a man can u&s;e
again&s;t us, if he can find means to per&s;uade us,
that it proceeds from the exce&s;s and delicacy of
his pa&s;&s;ion. It is no other than a &s;ilent compli|ment,
by which our accompli&s;hments are con|tinually
&s;lattered, and plea&s;es in proportion to the
&s;uppo&s;ed under&s;tanding of him who pays it.</P>
<P>By the&s;e arts and advantages this con&s;ummate
politician in love began by degrees to &s;ap the
foundations of my conjugal faith; he &s;tole imper|ceptibly
into my affection, and, by dint of oppor|tunity,
which he well knew how to improve,
triumphed, at la&s;t, over all his rivals.</P>
<P>Nor was he the only per&s;on that di&s;puted
my heart with Earl C&mdash;, who was al&s;o rivaled
by lord C&mdash;H&mdash;, a Scotchman, who had been
an intimate and relation of my former husband.
This gentleman I would have preferred to mo&s;t
<PB N="99" REF="104">
of his competitors, and I coqueted with him for
&s;ome time: but this amour was interrupted by
his going to Ireland; upon which occa&s;ion, under|&s;tanding
that he was but indifferently provided
with money, I made him a pre&s;ent of a gold
&s;nuff-box, in which was inclo&s;ed a bank-note; a
trifling mark of my e&s;teem, which he afterwards
ju&s;tified by the mo&s;t grateful, friendly, and gen|teel,
behaviour; and as we corre&s;ponded by let|ters,
I frankly told him, that Mr. S&mdash;had &s;tept
in, and won the palm from all the re&s;t of my ad|mirers.</P>
<P>This new favourite's mothers and &s;i&s;ters, who
lived in the neighbourhood, were my con&s;tant
companions; and, in con&s;equence of this inti|macy,
he never let a day pa&s;s without paying his
re&s;pects to me in per&s;on; nay, &s;o ingenious was
he in contriving the means of promoting his &s;uit,
that whether I rode or walked, went abroad or
&s;tayed at home, he was always of cour&s;e one of the
party: &s;o that his de&s;ign &s;eemed to ingro&s;s his whole
vigilance and attention. Thus he &s;tudied my di&s;|po&s;ition,
and e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf in my good opi|nion,
at the &s;ame time. He found my heart
was &s;u&s;ceptible of every tender impre&s;&s;ion, and
&s;aw that I was not free from the vanity of youth;
he had already acquired my friend&s;hip and e&s;teem,
from which he knew there was a &s;hort and ea&s;y
tran&s;ition to love; and by his penetration choo&s;ing
proper &s;ea&s;ons for the theme, urged it with &s;uch
pathetic vows and artful adulation, as well
might captivate a young woman of my complexion
and inexperience, and circum&s;tanced as I was,
with a hu&s;band whom I had &s;uch rea&s;on to de|&s;pi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="105">
Tho' he thus made an in&s;en&s;ible progre&s;s in
my heart, he did not find my virtue an ea&s;y con|que&s;t;
and I my&s;elf was ignorant of the advantage
he had gained, with regard to my inclinations,
until I was convinced of his &s;ucce&s;s by an alarm
of jealou&s;y which I one day felt, at &s;eeing him
engaged in conver&s;ation with another lady. I
forthwith recognized this &s;ymptom of love, with
which I had been formerly acquainted, and
trembled at the di&s;covery of my own weakne&s;s,
I underwent a &s;trange agitation and mixture of
contrary &s;en&s;ations: I was plea&s;ed with the pa&s;|&s;ion,
yet a&s;hamed of avowing it even to my own
mind. The rights of a hu&s;band (tho' mine was
but a nominal one) occurred to my reflexion,
and virtue, mode&s;ty and honour forbad me to
cheri&s;h the guilty flame.</P>
<P>While I encouraged the&s;e laudable &s;cruples,
and re&s;olved to &s;acrifice my love to duty and re|putation,
my lord was almo&s;t every day employ|ed
in riding po&s;t to my father, with complaints of
my conduct, which was hitherto irreproachable;
tho' the greate&s;t grievance which he pretended to
have &s;uffered, was my refu&s;ing to comply with
his de&s;ire, when he intreated me to lie a whole
hour every morning, with my neck uncovered,
that by gazing he might quiet the perturbation of
his &s;pirits. From this reque&s;t you may judge of
the man, as well as of the regard I mu&s;t enter|tain
for his character and di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>During the whole &s;ummer I was be&s;ieged by
my artful undoer, and in the autumn &s;et out
with my lord for Bath, where, by rea&s;on of the
intimacy that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between our families, we
lived in the &s;ame hou&s;e with my lover and his
&s;i&s;ter, who, with another agreeable young lady,
<PB N="101" REF="106">
accompanied us in this expedition. By this time
Mr. S&mdash;had extorted from me a confe&s;&s;ion of a
mutual flame, tho' I a&s;&s;ured him that it &s;hould
never induce me to give up the valuable po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions
of an un&s;potted character, and a con&s;cience
void of offence. I offered him all the enjoy|ment
he could reap from an unre&s;erved inter|cour&s;e
of &s;ouls, ab&s;tracted from any &s;en&s;ual con|&s;ideration;
and he eagerly embraced the Plato|nic
propo&s;al, becau&s;e he had &s;agacity enough to
fore&s;ee the i&s;&s;ue of &s;uch chimerical contracts, and
knew me too well to think he could accompli&s;h
his purpo&s;e without &s;eeming to acquie&s;ce in my
own terms, and cultivating my tenderne&s;s under
the &s;pecious pretext.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this agreement we took all
opportunities of &s;eeing each other in private; and
the&s;e interviews were &s;pent in mutual prote&s;ta|tions
of di&s;intere&s;ted love. This corre&s;pondence,
tho' dangerous, was (on my &s;ide) equally inno|cent
and endearing; and many happy hours we
pa&s;s'd, before my &s;entiments were di&s;covered.
At length my lover was taken ill, and then my
pa&s;&s;ion bur&s;t out beyond the power of conceal|ment;
my grief and anxiety became &s;o con&s;pi|caous
in my countenance, and my behaviour was
&s;o indi&s;creet, that every body in the hou&s;e per|ceived
the &s;ituation of my thoughts, and blamed
my conduct accordingly.</P>
<P>Certain it is I was extremely imprudent, tho'
intentionally innocent. I have lain whole nights
by my lord, who teized and tormented me for
that which neither I could give nor he could take,
and ruminated on the fatal con&s;equence of this
unhappy flame, until I was worked into a fever
of di&s;quiet. I &s;aw there was no &s;afety but in
<PB N="102" REF="107">
flight, and often determined to bani&s;h my&s;elf for
ever from the &s;ight of this dangerous intruder.
But my re&s;olution always failed at the approach
of day, and my de&s;ire of &s;eeing him as con&s;tant|ly
recurred. So far was I from per&s;i&s;ting in &s;uch
commendable determinations, that, on the eve of
our departure from Bath, I felt the keene&s;t pangs
of &s;orrow at our approaching &s;eparation; and as
we could not enjoy our private interviews at my
hou&s;e in town, I promi&s;ed to vi&s;it him at his own
apartments, after he had &s;worn by all that's &s;a|cred,
that he would take no &s;ini&s;ter advantage of
my conde&s;cen&s;ion, by pre&s;uming upon the op|portunities
I &s;hould give.</P>
<P>He kept his word; for he &s;aw I tru&s;ted to it
with fear and trembling, and perceived that my
apprehen&s;ion was not affected, but the natural
concern of a young creature, di&s;tracted between
love and duty, whom, had he alarmed, he never
would have &s;een within his doors again. In&s;tead
of pre&s;&s;ing me with &s;ollicitations in favour of his
pa&s;&s;ion, he was more than ever re&s;pectful and
complai&s;ant; &s;o that I found my&s;elf di&s;engaged
of all re&s;traint, conducted the conver&s;ation,
&s;hortened and repeated my vi&s;its, at my own
plea&s;ure, till, at la&s;t, I became &s;o accu&s;tomed to
this communication, that his hou&s;e was as fami|liar
to me as my own.</P>
<P>Having in this manner &s;ecured him&s;elf in my
confidence, he re&s;umed the favourite topic of
love, and warming my imagination by gradual
advances on the &s;ubject, my heart began to pant;
and when he &s;aw me thus, he &s;natched the favou|rable
occa&s;ion to practi&s;e all his eloquence and
art. I could not re&s;i&s;t his energy, nor even fly
from the temptation that a&s;&s;ailed me, until he
<PB N="103" REF="108">
had obtained a promi&s;e that he &s;hould, at our
next meeting, reap the fruits of his tedious ex|pectation.
Upon this condition I was permitted
to retire, and ble&s;&s;ed heaven for my e&s;cape,
fully determined to continue in the path of virtue
I had hitherto trod, and &s;tifle the criminal flame,
by which my peace and reputation were endan|gered.
But his idea, which reigned within my
heart, without controul, &s;oon ba&s;&s;ied all tho&s;e
prudent &s;ugge&s;tions.</P>
<P>I &s;aw him again; and he reminded me of my
promi&s;e, which I endeavoured to evade with affect|ed
plea&s;antry; upon which he manife&s;ted the ut|mo&s;t
di&s;plea&s;ure and chagrin, &s;hedding &s;ome cro|codile
tears, and upbraiding me with levity and
indifference. He ob&s;erved, that he had &s;ollicited
my favour for ten long months, without inter|mi&s;&s;ion,
and imagined I had held out &s;o long
on virtuous motives only; but now he could
plainly perceive that his want of &s;ucce&s;s had been
owing to my want of affection; and that all my
profe&s;&s;ions were in&s;incere: in a word, he per|&s;uaded
me, that his remon&s;trances were ju&s;t and
rea&s;onable. I could not &s;ee the affliction of a man
I loved, when I knew it was in my power to re|move
it; and rather than forfeit his opinion of
my &s;incerity and love, I con&s;ented to his wi&s;h.
My heart now flutters at the remembrance of the
dear, tho' fatal indi&s;cretion; yet I reflect with|out
remor&s;e, and even remember it with plea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>If I could not avoid the cen&s;ure of the world,
I was re&s;olved to bear it without repining; and
&s;ure the guilt (if there was any in my conduct)
was but venial; for I con&s;idered my&s;elf as a per|&s;on
ab&s;olved of all matrimonial ties, by the in|&s;ignificance
<PB N="104" REF="109">
of lord&mdash;, who, tho' a nominal
hu&s;band, was, in fact, a mere non entity. I
therefore contracted a new engagement with my
lover, to which I re&s;olved to adhere with the
mo&s;t &s;crupulous fidelity, without the lea&s;t inten|tion
of injuring my lord or his relations; for had
our mutual pa&s;&s;ion produced any vi&s;ible effects, I
would immediately have renounced and aban|doned
my hu&s;band for ever, that the fruit of my
love for Mr. S&mdash;might not have inherited, to
the detriment of the right heir. This was my
determination, which I thought ju&s;t, if not pru|dent;
and for which I have incurred the imputa|tion
of folly, in the opinion of this wi&s;e and ho|ne&s;t
generation, by who&s;e example and advice I
have, &s;ince that time, been a little reformed in
point of prudentials, tho' I &s;till retain a &s;trong
tendency to return to my primitive way of think|ing.</P>
<P>When I quitted Mr. S&mdash;, after the &s;acrifice
I had made, and returned to my own bed, it
may perhaps be &s;uppo&s;ed that I &s;lept but little.
True: I was kept awake by the joyful impa|tience
of revi&s;iting my lover. Indeed I neglect|ed
no opportunity of flying to his arms: when
lord&mdash;was in the country we enjoyed each
other's company without interruption, but when
he re&s;ided in town our corre&s;pondence was li|mited
to &s;tolen interviews, which were un&s;peak|ably
delicious, as genuine love pre&s;ided at the en|tertainment.</P>
<P>Such was my happine&s;s, in the cour&s;e of this
tender communication, that to this day I remem|ber
it with plea&s;ure, tho' it has co&s;t me dear in
the &s;equel, and was at that time enjoyed at a
con&s;iderable expence; for I devoted my&s;elf &s;o in|tirely
<PB N="105" REF="110">
to my lover, who was de&s;irous of en|gro&s;&s;ing
my time and thoughts, that my ac|quaintance,
which was very numerous, ju&s;tly ac|cu&s;ed
me of neglect, and of con&s;equence cooled
in their friend&s;hips: but I was <HI>all for love, or the
world well lo&s;t.</HI> And were the &s;ame opportunity
to offer, I would act the &s;ame conduct over
again.</P>
<P>Some there are who po&s;&s;ibly may wonder how
I could love twice with &s;uch violence of affection:
but all &s;uch ob&s;ervers mu&s;t be unacquainted with
the human heart. Mine was naturally adapted
for the tender pa&s;&s;ions, and had been &s;o fortunate,
&s;o cheri&s;hed, in its fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, that it felt
with joy the &s;ame &s;en&s;ations revive, when in|fluenced
by the &s;ame engaging qualifications.
Certain it is I loved the &s;econd time as well as the
fir&s;t, and better was impo&s;&s;ible. I gave up my
all for both: fortune and my father's favour for
the one; reputation, friends, and fortune for the
other. Yet, notwith&s;tanding this intimate con|nexion,
I did not relinqui&s;h the world all at
once; on the contrary I &s;till appeared at court,
and attracted the notice and approbation of my
royal patrone&s;s; I danced with the p&mdash;of W&mdash;;
a circum&s;tance which &s;o nearly affected Mr. S&mdash;,
who was pre&s;ent, that, in order to manife&s;t his
re&s;entment, he cho&s;e the uglie&s;t woman in the
ball for his partner; and I no &s;ooner perceived his
unea&s;ine&s;s than I gave over, with a view of ap|pea&s;ing
his di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Without repeating particular circum&s;tances,
let it &s;uffice to &s;ay, our mutual pa&s;&s;ion was a
perfect copy of that which had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between
me and dear lord W&mdash;m. It was jealous,
melting and delicate, and checquered with little
<PB N="106" REF="111">
accidents, which &s;erve to animate and maintain
the flame, in its fir&s;t ardency of rapture. When
my lover was &s;ick, I attended and nur&s;ed him
with indefatigable tenderne&s;s and care; and dur|ing
an indi&s;po&s;ition which I caught in the per|formance
of this agreeable office, he di&s;charged
the obligation with all the warmth of &s;ympathy
and love.</P>
<P>It was, however, judged nece&s;&s;ary by the
phy&s;icians, that I &s;hould u&s;e the Bath-waters for
the recovery of my health; and I &s;et out for that
place, glad of a pretence to be ab&s;ent from lord
&mdash;, with whom I lived on very unhappy terms.
He had, about nine months after our marriage,
de&s;ired that we might &s;leep in &s;eparate beds, and
gave a very whim&s;ical rea&s;on for this propo&s;al.
He &s;aid, the immen&s;ity of his love deprived him
of the power of gratification, and that &s;ome
commerce with an object, to which his heart was
not attached, might, by dimini&s;hing the tran&s;ports
of his &s;pirits, recompo&s;e his nerves, and enable
him to enjoy the fruits of his good fortune.</P>
<P>You may be &s;ure I made no objections to this
plan, which was immediately put in execution.
He made his addre&s;&s;es to a nymph of Drury-lane,
who&s;e name (as he told me) was Mrs. Rock.
She made &s;hift to extract &s;ome money from her
patient; but his infirmity was beyond the power
of her art; though &s;he made &s;ome mi&s;chief be|tween
us; and I communicated my &s;u&s;picion to
duke H&mdash;, who intended to have expo&s;tu|lated
with her upon the &s;ubject; but &s;he got inti|mation
of his de&s;ign, and &s;aved him the trouble,
by a precipitate retreat.</P>
<P>After my return from the Bath, where Mr. $word$
and I had lived happily, until we were interrupted
<PB N="107" REF="112">
by the arrival of my hu&s;band, his lord&s;hip ex|pre&s;&s;ed
an inclination to be my bedfellow again;
but in this particular I de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed: for
though I would not be the fir&s;t to propo&s;e the &s;e|paration,
which, though u&s;ual in other countries,
is contrary to the cu&s;tom of England, being un|willing
to furni&s;h the lea&s;t handle for cen&s;ure,
as my character was &s;till unblemi&s;hed; yet, when
the propo&s;al came from him&s;elf, I thought my&s;elf
intitled to refu&s;e a re-union, to which I accord|ingly
objected.</P>
<P>This oppo&s;ition produced a quarrel, which ro&s;e
to a &s;tate of perpetual animo&s;ity; &s;o that we be|gan
to talk of parting. My lord reli&s;hed the ex|pedient,
agreeing to add three hundred pounds a
year to my pin-money, which (by the bye) was
never paid; and I renounced all &s;tate and gran|deur,
to live in a &s;mall hou&s;e that I hired at Ca&s;e|horton,
where I pa&s;&s;ed my time for two months,
in the mo&s;t agreeable retirement, with my dear
lover, till I was di&s;turbed by the intru&s;ion of my
lord, who mole&s;ted me with vi&s;its and &s;olicita|tions
to return, pretending that he had changed
his mind, and in&s;i&s;ting upon my compliance with
his de&s;ire.</P>
<P>I exhau&s;ted my invention in endeavours to
evade his reque&s;t; but he per&s;ecuted me without
cea&s;ing: &s;o that I was fain to capitulate, on con|dition
that we &s;hould immediately &s;et out for
France; and that he &s;hould not pre&s;ume to ap|proach
my bed, till our arrival at Cal$is. We ac|cordingly
departed for that kingdom; and, far
from infringing the la&s;t article of our treaty, his
lord&s;hip did not in&s;i&s;t upon his privilege, before
we reached the capital of France.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="113">
Mean while, I began to feel the effect of my
pa&s;&s;ion in a very intere&s;ting manner, and com|municated
my di&s;covery to the dear author of it,
who would not leave me in &s;uch an affecting &s;i|tuation,
but took the fir&s;t opportunity of follow|ing
us to France.</P>
<P>In our road to Paris, we &s;topp'd to vi&s;it Chan|tilly,
a magnificent Chateau belonging to the
prince of Cond&eacute;, and there met by accident with
&s;ome Engli&s;h noblemen, to whom I was known.
The prince and his &s;i&s;ters invited me very politely
into the gallery where they &s;at. They comple|mented
me on my per&s;on, and &s;eemed to admire
my dre&s;s, which was altogether new to them,
being a blue Engli&s;h riding-habit trimmed with
gold, and an hat with a feather. They were
particularly well plea&s;ed with my hair, which
hung down to my wai&s;t, and pre&s;&s;ed me to &s;tay
a fortnight at their hou&s;e; an invitation which I
was very much mortified at being obliged to re|fu&s;e,
becau&s;e my lord did not under&s;tand the
French language. I was inchanted with the
place and the company, the women being amiable
and the men polite; nor were they &s;trangers to
my name and &s;tory; for Mr. S&mdash;calling at
the &s;ame place a few days after, they rallied him
on my account.</P>
<P>When we arrived at Paris, the fir&s;t thing I
did was to metamorpho&s;e my&s;elf into a French
woman. I cut off my hair, hid a very good
complexion of my own with <HI>Rouge,</HI> reconcile$
my&s;elf to powder, which I had never u&s;ed before,
put on a robe with a large hoop, and went to
the <HI>Thuilleries,</HI> full of &s;pirits and joy; for at that
time every thing con&s;pired to make me happy: $
had health, youth and beauty, love, vanity $word$
<PB N="109" REF="114">
affluence, and found my&s;elf &s;urrounded with di|ver&s;ions,
which were gay, new and agreeable.
My appearance drew upon me the eyes of the
whole company, who con&s;idered me as a &s;tranger,
but not a foreigner, &s;o compleatly was I equipped
in the fa&s;hion of the French; and when they un|der&s;tood
who I was, they applauded my per&s;on
with the mo&s;t lavi&s;h encomiums, according to
their known politene&s;s.</P>
<P>After having made a circuit round all the pub|lic
places of entertainment in Paris, I was intro|duced
into company, by an Engli&s;h family re|&s;iding
in that city; and, among others, became
acquainted with a French lady, who&s;e charms
were remarkably attractive. The duke of K&mdash;
was her admirer; but &s;he lived in reputation
with her mother and an agreeable &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e
lover was the prince of C&mdash;, (for almo&s;t every
lady in France has her <HI>Amant.</HI>)</P>
<P>With this charming woman, who&s;e name was
Madam De la T&mdash;, I often made parties of
plea&s;ure. The duke, Mr. S&mdash;, &s;he and I,
u&s;ed to meet in the Bois de Boulogne, which is
a plea&s;ant wood at a &s;mall di&s;tance from Paris,
whither the company repairs, in the &s;ummer|&s;ea&s;on,
for the benefit of the air; and after hav|ing
amu&s;ed our&s;elves among the groves, em|barked
in his grace's equipage, which was ex|tremely
elegant, being a cala&s;h drawn by &s;ix
fine long-tailed greys, adorned with ribbons in
the French ta&s;te; and thus we were conducted
to a little inchanted, or at lea&s;t inchanting palace,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the duke, at one end of the town.
The lower apartment, appropriated to me, was
furni&s;hed with yellow and &s;ilver, the bed &s;ur|rounded
with looking gla&s;&s;es, and the door opened
<PB N="110" REF="115">
into a garden, laid out in a cradle-walk, and in|tervening
parterres of ro&s;es and other flowers.
Above &s;tairs my female companion lodged, in a
chamber furni&s;hed with chintz. We &s;upped all
together in the &s;aloon, which, though &s;mall, was
perfectly elegant. The company was always
good-humoured, the conver&s;ation &s;prightly and
joyous, and the &s;cene, though often repeated,
&s;till delightful and entertaining.</P>
<P>At other times, Mr. S&mdash;and I u&s;ed to pa&s;s
our evenings at the palace of the prince of C&mdash;,
which his highne&s;s lent us for our accommoda|tion.
The apartments opened into the gardens
of the Luxembourg, and were, in point of mag|nificence,
&s;uitable to the owner. Thither I u&s;ed
to repair in a flaming equipage, on pretence of
vi&s;iting, and &s;pent the be&s;t part of the night with
him, who was dearer to me than all the princes
in the world.</P>
<P>While I was happily engaged in the&s;e ravi&s;hing
parties, my little lord was employed in efforts to
recover his health by re&s;toratives, and I know not
what; for he &s;till lamented the enfeebling effects
of his pa&s;&s;ion, and complained, that he loved me
more like an angel than a woman, though he
&s;trove to govern his affection according to the
doctrines of the chri&s;tian religion, as he regu|lated
his life by the maxims of Charles the twelfth
of Sweden. The meaning of this declaration I
could never learn; and indeed, I have been often
tempted to believe he had no meaning at all.</P>
<P>Be that as it will, I found my &s;ize vi&s;ibly in|crea&s;ing,
and my &s;ituation extremely unea&s;y, on
account of the perpetual wrangling which pre|vailed
betwixt us, in con&s;equence of his de&s;iring
to &s;leep with me again, after we had parted beds
<PB N="111" REF="116">
for the &s;econd time: and, that I might be no
longer expo&s;ed to &s;uch di&s;agreeable per&s;ecution, I
re&s;olved to leave him, though at the hazard of
my life.</P>
<P>Thus determined, I went to the Briti&s;h em|ba&s;&s;ador
in an hackney coach; and, in order to
di&s;gui&s;e my youth, which might have prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
him again&s;t my judgment, muffled my&s;elf up in
a black hood, which (as he &s;aid) in&s;tead of lending
an air of gravity to my countenance, added a wild|ne&s;s
to my looks, which was far from being di&s;|agreeable.
He had been agallant man in his youth,
and even then, though well &s;tricken in years,
was not in&s;en&s;ible to the power of beauty. This
di&s;po&s;ition, perhaps, rendered him more favour|able
to my cau&s;e, though he at fir&s;t advi&s;ed me to
return to my hu&s;band; but finding me ob&s;tinate, he
undertook to &s;erve me in my own way, and pro|cure
a protection from the French king, by virtue
of which, I could live at Paris unmole&s;ted by my
lord. Neverthele&s;s, he advi&s;ed me (if I was de|termined
to leave him) to make the be&s;t of my
way to England, and &s;ue for a divorce.</P>
<P>I reli&s;hed his opinion, and concealed my&s;elf
about three days in Paris, during which I bor|rowed
&s;ome linen; for, as it was impo&s;&s;ible to
convey any thing out of my own hou&s;e without
&s;u&s;picion, I had neither cloaths for my accom|modation,
nor a &s;ervant to wait on me.</P>
<P>In this &s;olitary condition I took the road to
Flanders, after I had put my lord upon a wrong
&s;cent, by writing a letter to him, dated at Calais,
and travelled through an unknown country, with|out
any other attendant than the po&s;tilion, being
&s;ubjected to this inconvenience by the laws of
France, which are &s;o &s;evere in &s;ome particulars,
<PB N="112" REF="117">
that if any per&s;on had been apprehended with
me, he would have &s;uffered death, for going
off with a man's wife; though any man might
go to bed with the &s;ame woman, without fear or
incurring any legal puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>I proceeded night and day without intermi&s;|&s;ion,
that I might the &s;ooner reach Flanders,
where I knew I &s;hould be &s;afe; and as the nights
were exce&s;&s;ively cold, I was fain to wrap my&s;elf
up in flannel, which I bought for the purpo&s;e,
as I had no cloaths to keep me warm, and tra|velled
in an open chai&s;e. While we pa&s;&s;ed
through dreary woods, quite remote from the ha|bitations
of men, I was not without apprehen|&s;ion
of being &s;tripped and murthered by the po|&s;tilion;
and, in all probability, owed my &s;afety to
the indigence of my appearance, which might
al&s;o protect me in two mi&s;erable places where I
was obliged to lie, before I got out of the terr|tories
of France: for, as I could not reach the
great towns where I intended to lodge, I was
under the nece&s;&s;ity of putting up at little wretched
hovels, where no provi&s;ion was to be had, but
&s;our brown bread and &s;ourer chee&s;e; and every
thing &s;eemed to denote the dens of de&s;pair and a$|&s;a&s;&s;ination.</P>
<P>I made &s;hift, however, to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on this fare,
uncomfortable as it was, confided in the meanne$s
of my equipage for the &s;ecurity of my per&s;on;
and at length arriving at Bru&s;&s;els, fixed my quar|ters
in the Hotel de Flandre (&s;o well known to the
Engli&s;h &s;ince) where I thought my&s;elf extremely
happy in the accompli&s;hment of my flight.</P>
<P>I had not been full two days in this place,
when I was ble&s;&s;ed with the &s;ight of my lovers
and having concerted mea&s;ures for proceeding $
<PB N="113" REF="118">
England, I hired a tall fine Liegeoi&s;e for a maid;
and &s;etting out for O&s;tend, we embarked in a
ve&s;&s;el, in which Mr. S&mdash;had be&s;poke our pa&s;|&s;age.
Our voyage was &s;hort and pro&s;perous, and
the time mo&s;t agreeably &s;pent in the company of
my dear partner, who was a mo&s;t engaging man
in all re&s;pects, as I dare &s;ay my lady O&mdash;has
&s;ince found him.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;umed a fictitious name, took private lodg|ings
in Poland-&s;treet, retained lawyers, and com|menced
a &s;uit for &s;eparation again&s;t my lord. I
communicated the rea&s;ons of my elopement to
my father, who was &s;hocked and &s;urpri&s;ed at my
conduct, which he condemned with expre&s;&s;ions
of &s;orrow and re&s;entment. But the &s;tep was ta|ken;
nor did I repent of what I had done, ex|cept
on his account.</P>
<P>In the morning after my arrival at London, I
waited upon the lord-chief-ju&s;tice, to whom I
complained of the u&s;age I had received from my
lord, who&s;e temper was teazing, tire&s;ome, and
intolerably capricious. His behaviour was a &s;trange
compound of madne&s;s and folly, &s;ea&s;oned with a
&s;mall proportion of &s;en&s;e: no wonder then that
I who am hot and ha&s;ty, &s;hould be wretched,
under the per&s;ection of &s;uch a perver&s;e hu|mouri&s;t,
who u&s;ed to terrify me, and &s;cold at
me the whole night without intermi&s;&s;ion, and
&s;hake my pillow from time to time, that I might
not &s;leep, while he tormented me with his di&s;|agreeable
expo&s;tulations. I have been often
frightened almo&s;t out of my &s;en&s;es, at &s;eeing
him convul&s;ed by the mo&s;t unrea&s;onable pa&s;|&s;ion;
and chagrined to the highe&s;t degree of
di&s;gu&s;t, to find (by repeated ob&s;ervation) his di&s;|po&s;ition
&s;o prepo&s;terous, that his &s;atisfaction and
<PB N="114" REF="119">
di&s;plea&s;ure never depended upon the cau&s;e he had
to be &s;atisfied or di&s;obliged; but, on the con|trary,
when he had mo&s;t rea&s;on to be plea&s;ed, he
was always mo&s;t di&s;contented, and very often in
good humour, when he had rea&s;on enough for
vexation.</P>
<P>While I lived in Poland-&s;treet, I was engaged
with lawyers, and &s;o often vi&s;ited by my father,
that I could not dedicate my whole time, as
u&s;ual, to my lover; nor was it convenient that
he &s;hould be &s;een in my company: he therefore
took a &s;mall hou&s;e at Camberwell, whither I
went as often as I had an opportunity; and main|tained
the corre&s;pondence with &s;uch eagerne&s;s and
indu&s;try, that although I was &s;ix months gone
with child, I have often, by my&s;elf, &s;et out for
his habitation, in an hackney-coach, at eleven
o'clock at night, and returned by &s;ix in the morn|ing,
that I might be in my own bed, when my
father came to &s;ee me; for I concealed my amout,
as well as the effects of it, from his knowledge,
and frequently took water from the Bridge, that
my motions might not be di&s;covered. Nothing
but the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate love could have &s;up|ported
my &s;pirits under &s;uch vici&s;&s;itudes of fi|tigue,
or enabled my admirer to &s;pend whole
days by him&s;elf, in &s;uch a &s;olitary retirement.</P>
<P>By this time, my lord was arrived in England
and employed in di&s;covering the place of my re|treat;
&s;o that I lived in continual alarm, and
provided my&s;elf with a &s;peaking-trumpet, which
&s;tood by my bed &s;ide, to be u&s;ed in calling &s;o
a&s;i&s;tance, in ca&s;e my pur&s;uer &s;hould make $
attack upon my lodgings.</P>
<P>This &s;ituation being extremely uncomfortable
I had no &s;ooner begun my proce&s;s again&s;t him
<PB N="115" REF="120">
than I put my&s;elf intirely under the protection of
Mr. S&mdash;, who conducted me to the hou&s;e of a
friend of his who lived in the country, where I
was &s;ecure from the attempts of my hu&s;band.</P>
<P>The world had now given me up, and I had
renounced the world with the mo&s;t perfect re|&s;ignation.
I weighed in my own brea&s;t what I
&s;hould lo&s;e in point of character, with what I
&s;uffered in my peace at home, and found, that
my reputation was not to be pre&s;erved, except at
the expence of my quiet, (for his lord&s;hip was
not di&s;po&s;ed to make me ea&s;y, had I been never
&s;o di&s;creet.) I therefore determined to give up a
&s;aw ceremonial vi&s;its, and empty profe&s;&s;ions, for
the more &s;ub&s;tantial enjoyments of life.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed our time very agreeably, in various
amu&s;ements, with this friend of Mr. S&mdash;, until
the term of my reckoning was almo&s;t expired,
then returned to London, and took lodgings in
Southampton &s;treet, where I began to make pre|parations
for the approaching occa&s;ion. Here I
propo&s;ed to live with the utmo&s;t circum&s;pection.
I di&s;gui&s;ed my name, &s;aw nobody but my lawyer
and lover, and never approached the window,
le&s;t I &s;hould be di&s;covered by accident.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e precautions, my French
maid, whom I had &s;ent for &s;ome of my cloaths,
was dogged in her return, and next morning my
lord took my lodgings by &s;torm. Had he gi|ven
the a&s;&s;ault in his own per&s;on only, I make
no doubt but he would have &s;uffered a repul&s;e,
from the oppo&s;ition of the Ligeoi&s;e, who made
all the re&s;i&s;tance in her power, but was obliged
to give way to &s;uperior number.</P>
<P>I was at that time abed, and hearing an un|u&s;ual
noi&s;e below, rung my bell, in order to
<PB N="116" REF="121">
know the cau&s;e of &s;uch di&s;turbance. I drew my
curtain at the &s;ame time, and who &s;hould I &s;ee
entering my chamber but his lord&s;hip, attended
by a con&s;table, and the &s;ootman who had detected
my retreat!</P>
<P>Such an unexpected vi&s;it could not fail to affect
me with &s;urprize and con&s;ternation: however, $
&s;ummoned all my fortitude to my aid, and per|ceiving
the fellows were about to open my window-&s;hutters
de&s;ired their principal to order them down|&s;tairs.
He readily complied with my reque&s;t, and
&s;itting down by my bed-&s;ide, told me with an a$$
of triumph, that he had found me at la&s;t; and $
frankly owned, that I was heartily &s;orry for his
&s;ucce&s;s. In&s;tead of upbraiding me with me
e&s;cape, he proceeded to entertain me with all the
news in town, and gave me a minute detail of
every thing which had happened to him &s;ince our
parting; among other articles of intelligence,
giving me to under&s;tand, that he had cha'lenged
Mr. S&mdash;, who had refu&s;ed to fight him, and
was in di&s;grace with the prince of W&mdash;$word$
that account.</P>
<P>But here his lord&s;hip did not &s;trictly adhere to
the naked truth: he had indeed, before our de|parture
for the country, gone to my lover, and
in&s;i&s;ted upon having &s;atisfaction in Hyde-park,
two days from the date of his demand, and at
three o'clock in the afternoon; S&mdash;believing
him in earne&s;t, accepted the invitation; thou$$t
he ob&s;erved, that the&s;e affairs could not be di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed
too &s;oon, and wi&s;hed the time of meeting
might be at an earlier hour. But his lord&s;hip
did not choo&s;e to alter the circum&s;tances of has
fir&s;t propo&s;al; and when he went away, &s;aid $word$
<PB N="117" REF="122">
&s;hould expect him at the appointed time and
place, if it did not rain.</P>
<P>His antagoni&s;t gave me an account of the con|ver&s;ation,
when I a&s;&s;ured him the whole bu&s;ine&s;s
would end in &s;moke. Accordingly, my lord &s;ent
him a letter on Monday, de&s;iring that the a&s;&s;ig|nation
might be de&s;erred till Thur&s;day, that he
might have time to &s;ettle his affairs, and pay S&mdash;
an hundred pounds, which he had formerly bor|rowed
of him. When Thur&s;day came, he was
favoured with another epi&s;tle, importing, that
the challenger had changed his mind, and would
&s;eek &s;atisifaction at law. Thus ended that heroic
exploit, which his lord&s;hip now boa&s;ted of with
&s;uch arrogant mi&s;repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he regaled me with the&s;e intere&s;ting par|ticulars,
I was contriving a &s;cheme to &s;ru&s;trate
the di&s;covery he had made; &s;o that I did not con|tradict
his a&s;&s;ertions, but told him, that if he
would go down &s;tairs, I would ri&s;e and come to
breakfa&s;t. He con&s;ented to this propo&s;al with
great chearfulne&s;s; and I own, I was not a little
&s;urprized to find him, at this fir&s;t interview, in
as good humour, as if nothing had happened to
interrupt the felicity of our matrimonial union.</P>
<P>It co&s;t me &s;ome invention to conceal my con|dition
from his notice, being now within a week
of the expected cri&s;is: but I knew I had to do
with a man of no great penetration, and &s;uc|ceeded
in my attempt accordingly. We break|fa&s;ted
with great harmony, and I invited him to
dinner, after having prevailed upon him to &s;end
away his myrmidons, whom, neverthele&s;s, he
ordered to return at eleven o'clock at night.
We conver&s;ed together with great gaiety and
mirth; and when I rallied him for vi&s;iting me in
<PB N="118" REF="123">
&s;uch a di&s;habille, he &s;tood a tiptoe to view him|&s;elf
in the gla&s;s; and owning I was in the right,
&s;aid he would go and dre&s;s him&s;elf before dinner.</P>
<P>He accordingly went away, charging my maid
to give him entrance at his return; and he was
no &s;ooner gone than I wrote to Mr. S&mdash;. giv|ing
him an account of what had happened; then,
without having determined upon any certain
plan, huddled on my cloaths, muffled my&s;elf up,
and calling a chair, went to the next tavern,
where I &s;tayed no longer than was &s;ufficient to
change my vehicle; and, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of
the drawers, who could not conceive the mean|ing
of my perturbation, proceeded to a &s;hop in
the neighbourhood, where I di&s;mi&s;&s;ed my &s;econd
chair, and procured an hackney coach, in which
I repaired to the lodgings of my lawyer, whom I
could tru&s;t. Having made him acquainted with
the circum&s;tances of my di&s;tre&s;s, and con&s;ulted
him about a proper place of retreat, after &s;ome
recollection he directed me to a little hou&s;e in a
court, to which, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of my lover,
my woman and cloaths were &s;afely conveyed that
&s;ame evening.</P>
<P>My lord, however, came to dinner, accord|ing
to invitation, and did not &s;eem at all alarmed
when my maid told him I was gone, but &s;tepped
to my lawyer, to know if he thought I &s;hould re|turn;
and upon his an&s;wering in the affirmative,
and advi&s;ing his lord&s;hip to go back in the mean
time, and eat the dinner I had provided, he very
deliberately took his advice, made a very hearty
meal, drank his bottle of wine, and, as I did not
return, according to his expectation, withdrew,
in order to con&s;ult his a&s;&s;ociates.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="124">
This motion of his furni&s;hed my woman with
an opportunity of making her retreat; and when
he returned at night, the coa&s;t was clear, and he
found no body in the hou&s;e but a porter, who
had been left to take care of the furniture. He
was &s;o enraged at this di&s;appointment, that he
made a furious noi&s;e, which rai&s;ed the whole
neighbourhood, reinforced his crew with the au|thority
of a ju&s;tice of the peace, tarried in the
&s;treet till three o'clock in the morning, di&s;charg|ed
a lodging he had hired at a barber's &s;hop, op|po&s;ite
to the hou&s;e from which I had e&s;caped, and
retired with the comfortable reflexion of having
done every thing which man could do to retrieve
me.</P>
<P>The hurry of &s;pirits, and &s;urprize I had un|dergone
in effecting this retreat, produced &s;uch a
di&s;order in my con&s;titution, that I began to fear
I &s;hould be delivered before I could be provided
with nece&s;&s;aries for the occa&s;ion. I &s;ignified my
apprehen&s;ion to Mr. S&mdash;, who with infinite
care and concern endeavoured to find a more
convenient place; and, after all his inquiries,
was obliged to fix upon a paultry apartment in the
city, tho' his tenderne&s;s was extremely &s;hocked
at the nece&s;&s;ity of choo&s;ing it. However, there
was no remedy, nor time to be lo&s;t: to this mi|&s;erable
habitation I was carried in an hackney
$word$; and, tho' extremely ill, bore my fate
with &s;pirit and re&s;ignation, in te&s;timony of my
&s;incere and indelible attachment to my lover,
for who&s;e ea&s;e and plea&s;ure I could have &s;uffered
every inconvenience, and even &s;acrificed my
life.</P>
<P>Immed$ ately after I had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my
wretch apartment, I was con&s;trained by $word$
<PB N="120" REF="125">
di&s;po&s;ition to go to bed, and &s;end for the nece&s;|&s;ary
help; and in a few hours a living pledge of
my love and indi&s;cretion &s;aw the light, tho' the
terrors and fatigue I had undergone had affected
this little innocent &s;o &s;everely, that it &s;carce di&s;|covered
any vi&s;ible &s;igns of life.</P>
<P>My grief at this misfortune was inexpre&s;&s;ible:
I forthwith di&s;patched a me&s;&s;age to the dear, the
anxious father, who flew to my arms, and &s;hared
my &s;orrow, with all the gentlene&s;s of love and
parental fondne&s;s; yet our fears were happily
di&s;appointed by the recovery of our infant daugh|ter,
who was committed to the charge of a nur&s;e
in the neighbourhood; &s;o that I could every day
be &s;atisfied in my inquiries about her health.
Thus I continued a whole fortnight, in a &s;tate
of happine&s;s and tranquillity, being ble&s;&s;ed with the
conver&s;ation and tender offices of my admirer,
who&s;e love and attention I wholly ingro&s;&s;ed. In
a word, he gave up all bu&s;ine&s;s and amu&s;ement,
and concentred all his care and a&s;&s;iduity in mi|ni&s;tring
to my ea&s;e and &s;atisfaction. And &s;ure I
had no cau&s;e to regret what I had &s;uffered on his
account.</P>
<P>But this my agreeable &s;ituation was one day
di&s;turbed by a mo&s;t alarming accident, by which
my life was drawn into imminent danger. The
room under my bed-chamber took fire; I imme|diately
&s;melled it, and &s;aw the people about me
in the utmo&s;t perplexity and con&s;ternation, tho'
they would not own the true cau&s;e of their con|fu&s;ion,
left my health &s;hould &s;uffer in the fright.
Neverthele&s;s I was &s;o calm in my inquiries, that
they ventured to tell me my &s;u&s;picion was but too
ju&s;t: upon which I gave &s;uch directions as I
thought would &s;ecure me from catching cold, in
<PB N="121" REF="126">
ca&s;e there &s;hould be a nece&s;&s;ity for removing me;
but the fire being happily extingui&s;hed, I e&s;caped
that ceremony, which might have co&s;t me my
life. Indeed it was &s;urpri&s;ing, that the agitation
of my &s;pirits did not produce &s;ome fatal effect up|on
my con&s;titution; and I looked upon my deli|verance
as the protection of a particular provi|dence.</P>
<P>Tho' I e&s;caped the hazard of a &s;udden remo|val,
I $ound it was high time to change my lodg|ings,
becau&s;e the neighbours ru&s;hing into the
hou&s;e, upon the alarm of fire, had di&s;covered
my &s;ituation, though they were ignorant of
my name; and I did not think my&s;elf &s;afe, in
being the &s;ubject of their conjectures. Mr. S&mdash;
therefore procured another apartment, with bet|ter
accommodation, to which I was carried, as
&s;oon as my health would admit of my removal;
and &s;oon after my lord wrote to me, by the
hands of my lawyer, earne&s;tly intreating me to
drop my pro&s;ecution, and come home. But I
would not comply with his reque&s;t; and nothing
was farther from my intention than the de&s;ire of
receiving any favours at his hands.</P>
<P>Thus repul&s;ed, he &s;et on foot a mo&s;t accurate
&s;earch for my per&s;on; in the cour&s;e of which he
is &s;aid to have detected &s;everal ladies and young
girls, who had rea&s;ons for keeping them&s;elves
concealed; and had like to have been very &s;e|verely
handled for his impertinent curio&s;ity. Be|ing
un&s;ucce&s;sful in all his attempts, he entered
into treaty with one Sir R&mdash;H&mdash;, a per&s;on of a
very indifferent character, who undertook to fur|ni&s;h
him with an infallible expedient to di&s;cover
the place of my abode, if he would gratify him
with a bond for a thou&s;and pounds; which be|ing
executed accordingly, this worthy knight ad|verti&s;ed
<PB N="122" REF="127">
me and my maid in the public papers,
offering one hundred pounds as a reward to any
per&s;on who &s;hould di&s;clo&s;e the place of our re|tirement.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the paper fell into my hands I was
again involved in perplexity; and being afraid of
&s;taying in town, re&s;olved, with the concurrence
of my lover, to accept of an invitation I had re|ceived
from the duke of K&mdash;, who had by this
time arrived in England, with that lady whom
I have already mentioned, as one of our parties
at Paris. Having vi&s;ited my little in&s;ant, I next
day &s;et out for the duke's country-&s;eat, which is
a mo&s;t elegant <HI>chateau,</HI> and &s;tands in a charming
&s;ituation: Mr. S&mdash;followed in a few days; we
met with a very cordial reception; his grace
was civil and good-natured, lived nobly and
loved plea&s;ure; Madam la T&mdash;was formed to
plea&s;e: there was always a great deal of good
company in the hou&s;e; &s;o that we pa&s;&s;ed our
time agreeably in playing at billiards and cards,
hunting, walking, reading and conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>But my terms of happine&s;s were generally of
&s;hort duration. In the mid&s;t of all this felicity
I was overtaken by a mo&s;t &s;evere affliction, in the
death of my dear haple&s;s infant, who had in|gro&s;&s;ed
a greater &s;hare of my tenderne&s;s than per|haps
I even &s;hould have paid to the offspring of a
legitimate contract, becau&s;e the circum&s;tance of
her birth would have been an un&s;urmountable
misfortune to her thro' the whole cour&s;e of her
life, and rendered her ab&s;olutely dependent on
my love and protection.</P>
<P>While I &s;till lamented the untimely fate of
this fair blo&s;&s;om, lord&mdash;came down, and de|manded
me as his wife; but the &s;uit which I then
<PB N="123" REF="128">
maintained again&s;t him deprived him, for the pre|&s;ent,
of an husband's right; and therefore the
duke would not deliver me into his hands.</P>
<P>In &s;ix months he repeated his vi&s;it and de|mand;
and an agreement was patched up, in
con&s;equence of which I con&s;ented to live in the
&s;ame hou&s;e with him, on condition that he
&s;hould never de&s;ire to &s;leep with me, or take any
other mea&s;ure to di&s;turb my peace; otherwi&s;e I
&s;hould be at liberty to leave him again, and in|titled
to the provi&s;ion of a &s;eparate maintenance.
To the&s;e articles I a&s;&s;ented, by the advice of my
lawyers, with a view of obtaining the payment
of my pin-money, which I had never received
&s;ince our parting, but &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on the &s;ale of my
jewels, which were very con&s;iderable, and had
been pre&s;ented to me with full power of aliena|tion.
As to my lover, he had no fortune to &s;up|port
me; and for that rea&s;on I was &s;crupulou&s;ly
cautious of augmenting his expence.</P>
<P>We had now enjoyed each other's company
for three years, during which our mutual pa&s;&s;ion
had &s;uffered no abatement, nor had my happi|ne&s;s
been mixed with any con&s;iderable allay, ex|cept
that late &s;troke of providence which I have
already mentioned, and the reflexion of the &s;or|row
that my conduct had intailed upon my dear
father, whom I loved beyond expre&s;&s;ion, and
whom nothing could have compelled me to di&s;|oblige
but a more powerful flame, that prevailed
over every other con&s;ideration. As I was now
forced to break off this inchanting corre&s;pondence,
it is not to be doubted that our parting co&s;t us the
mo&s;t acute &s;en&s;ations of grief and di&s;appointment.
However, there was no remedy: I tore my&s;elf
from his arms, took my leave of the family, after
<PB N="124" REF="129">
having acknowledged my obligations to the duke,
and &s;et out for the place of rendezvous, where I
was met by my lord, attended by a &s;teward whom
he had lately engaged, and who was one chief
cau&s;e of our future &s;eparations. My lord having
quitted his hou&s;e in town, conducted me to his
lodgings in Pall-Mall, and in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;leeping
with me the fir&s;t night; but I refu&s;ed to grati$y
his de&s;ire, on the authority of our agreement.</P>
<P>This di&s;pute produced a quarrel, in con&s;e|quence
of which I attempted to leave the hou&s;e;
and he endeavouring to prevent my retreat, I
fairly locked him in, ran down &s;tairs, and calling
a hackney coach, made the be&s;t of my way into
the city, to my father's lodgings, where I lay,
the family being in town, tho' he him&s;elf was in
the country. I wrote to him immediately, and
when he came to London, declared my intention
of &s;eparating from my lord, with which, &s;eeing
me ob&s;tinate and determined, he at length ac|quie&s;ced,
and a formal &s;eparation accordingly en|&s;ued,
which at that time I thought binding and
immutable.</P>
<P>I was now &s;heltered under the wings of an in|dulgent
father, who had taken me into favour
again, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that my commerce
with Mr. S&mdash;was ab&s;olutely at an end. Never|thele&s;s,
tho' we had &s;eparated, in all appearance,
for ever, we had previou&s;ly agreed to maintain
our corre&s;pondence in private interviews, which
&s;hould e&s;cape the notice of the world, with
which I was again obliged to keep &s;ome mea|&s;ures.</P>
<P>Our parting at the duke of K&mdash;'s hou&s;e in the
country was attended with all the genuine marks
of &s;incere and reciprocal affection, and I lived in
<PB N="125" REF="130">
$he &s;weet hope of &s;eeing him again, in all the
tran&s;port of his former pa&s;&s;ion, when my lawyer,
who received my letters, brought me a billet one
night, ju&s;t as I had gone to bed. Seeing the &s;u|per&s;cription
of S&mdash;'s hand-writing, I opened it
with all the impatience of an ab&s;ent lover; but
how &s;hall I de&s;cribe the a&s;toni&s;hment and con|&s;ternation
with which I was &s;eized, when I pe|ru&s;ed
the contents! In&s;tead of the mo&s;t tender
$ows and prote&s;tations, this fatal epi&s;tle began
with, <HI>Madam, the be&s;t thing you can do is to re|turn
to your father;</HI> or &s;ome cold and killing
expre&s;&s;ion, to that effect.</P>
<P>Heaven and earth! what did I feel at this dire
conjancture! The light for&s;ook my eyes, a cold
&s;weat bedewed my limbs, and I was overwhelm|ed
with &s;uch a torrent of &s;orrow and &s;urprize,
that every body pre&s;ent believed I would have
died under the violent agitation. They endea|voured
to &s;upport my &s;pirits with repeated draughts
of &s;trong liquor, which had no &s;en&s;ible effect up|on
my con&s;titution, tho' for eight whole years I
had drank nothing &s;tronger than water; and I
mu&s;t have infallibly peri&s;hed in the fir&s;t exta&s;y of
my grief, had it not made its way in a fit of tears
and exclamation, in which I continued all night,
to the amazement of the family, whom my con|dition
had alarmed, and rai&s;ed from their repo&s;e.
My father was the only per&s;on who gue&s;&s;ed the
cau&s;e of my affliction; he &s;aid he was &s;ure I had
received &s;ome ill u&s;age in a letter or me&s;&s;age from
that ra&s;cal S&mdash;(&s;o he termed him in the bitter|ne&s;s,
of pa&s;&s;ion).</P>
<P>At mention of that name my agony redoubled
to &s;uch a degree, that all who were pre&s;ent wept
$word$ of my deplorable condition. My poor
<PB N="126" REF="131">
father &s;hed a flood of tears, and conjured me to tell
him the cau&s;e of my di&s;quiet: upon which, rather
than confe&s;s the truth, I amu&s;ed his concern,
by pretending that my lover was ill. The whole
family having &s;tayed by me till I was a little more
compo&s;ed, left me to the care of my maid, who
put me into bed about &s;ix in the morning; but I
enjoyed no re&s;t: I revolved every circum&s;tance
of my conduct, endeavouring to find out the
cau&s;e of this fatal change in S&mdash;'s di&s;po&s;ition; and
as I could recollect nothing which could ju&s;tly
give offence, concluded that &s;ome malicious per|&s;ons
had abu&s;ed his ears with &s;tories to my pre|judice.</P>
<P>With this conjecture I got up, and &s;ent my
lawyer to him with a letter, wherein I in&s;i&s;ted
upon &s;eeing him, that I might have an opportu|nity
of ju&s;tifying my&s;elf in per&s;on; a ta&s;k which
would be ea&s;ily performed, as I had never offend|ed,
but in loving too well. I waited with the
mo&s;t anxious impatience for the return of my
me&s;&s;enger, who brought me an an&s;wer couched
in the colde&s;t terms of civility which indifference
could dictate; acknowledging, however, that he
had nothing to lay to my charge, but that it was
for the good of us both we &s;hould part.&mdash;He
ought to have reflected on that before, not after
I had &s;acrificed my all for his love! I was well
nigh di&s;tracted by this confirmation of his incon|&s;tancy;
and I wonder to this day how I retained
the u&s;e of rea&s;on, under &s;uch circum&s;tances of
horror and de&s;pair! My grief laid a&s;ide all de|corum
and re&s;traint; I told my father that S&mdash;
was dying, and that I would vi&s;it him with all
expedition.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="132">
Startled at the propo&s;al, this careful parent de|mon&s;trated
the fatal con&s;equence of &s;uch an un|guarded
&s;tep, reminded me of the difficulty with
which he had prevailed upon my mother and
uncle to forgive my former imprudence, ob&s;erv|ed
that his intention was to carry me into the
country next day, in order to effect a perfect re|conciliation;
but now I was on the brink of forfeit|ing
all preten&s;ions to their regard, by committing
another fatal error, which could not po&s;&s;ibly be
retrieved; and that for his part, whatever pangs
it might co&s;t him, he was re&s;olved to bani&s;h me
from his &s;ight for ever.</P>
<P>While he uttered this declaration the tears
$word$ down his cheeks, and he &s;eemed over|whelmed
with the keene&s;t &s;orrow and mortifica|tion;
&s;o it may be ea&s;ily conceived what were
the impre&s;&s;ions of my grief, reinforced with the
affliction of a father whom I dearly loved, and
the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of being the cau&s;e of all his di&s;|quiet!
I was &s;truck dumb with remor&s;e and
woe; and when I recovered the u&s;e of &s;peech, I
$word$ him how &s;en&s;ible I was of his great goodne&s;s
and humanity, and owned how little I de&s;erved
his favour and affection; that the &s;en&s;e of my
own unworthine&s;s was one cau&s;e of my pre&s;ent
di&s;traction; for &s;uch was the condition of my
fate, that I mu&s;t either &s;ee S&mdash;or die. I &s;aid,
tho' I could not expect his forgivene&s;s, I was
$word$ worthy of his compa&s;&s;ion; that nothing
but the mo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible pa&s;&s;ion could have mi&s;led
me at fir&s;t from my duty, or tempted me to incur
the lea&s;t degree of his di&s;plea&s;ure; that the &s;ame
fatal influence &s;till prevailed, and would, in all
probability, continue to the grave, which was
the only abode in which I hoped for peace.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="133">
While I expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in this manner, my
dear good father wept with the mo&s;t tender &s;ym|pathy,
and &s;aying I might do as I plea&s;ed, for he
had done with me, quitted the room, leaving me
to the cruel &s;en&s;ations of my own heart, which
almo&s;t bur&s;ted with angui&s;h, upbraiding me with
a fault which I could not help committing.</P>
<P>I immediately hired a chariot and fix, and
would have &s;et out by my&s;elf, had not my fa|ther's
affection, which all my errors could not
efface, provided an attendant. He &s;aw me quite
delirious and de&s;perate; and therefore engaged a
relation of my own to accompany and take care
of me in this ra&s;h expedition.</P>
<P>During this journey, which la&s;ted two days, I
felt no remi&s;&s;ion of grief and anxiety, but under|went
the mo&s;t intolerable &s;orrow and &s;u&s;pen&s;e:
at la&s;t we arrived at a little hou&s;e called the Hut,
on Sali&s;bury plain, where, in the mo&s;t frantie
agitation, I wrote a letter to S&mdash;, de&s;cribing the
mi&s;erable condition to which I was reduced by
his unkindne&s;s, and de&s;iring to &s;ee him, with the
mo&s;t earne&s;t &s;ollicitations.</P>
<P>This billet I committed to the care of my at|tendant,
and laid &s;trong injunctions upon him to
tell Mr. S&mdash;, my injuries were &s;o great, and
my de&s;pair &s;o violent, that if he did not favour
me with a vi&s;it, I would go to him, though at his
&s;i&s;ter's hou&s;e, where he then was.</P>
<P>He received my me&s;&s;age with great coldne&s;s,
and told my friend, that if I would return to
London, without in&s;i&s;ting upon the interview I
demanded, he would in a little time follow me to
town, and every thing &s;hould be amicably ad|ju&s;ted.
But when the me&s;&s;enger a&s;&s;ured him,
that I was too much tran&s;ported with grief, to
<PB N="129" REF="134">
hear of &s;uch a propo&s;al, he con&s;ented to meet
me in the middle of Sali&s;bury-plain, that we
might avoid all ob&s;ervation: and though I was
little able to walk, I &s;et out on foot for the place
of a&s;&s;ignation, my companion following at a &s;mall
di&s;tance.</P>
<P>When I &s;aw him leading his hor&s;e down the
hill, I collected all my fortitude, and advanced
to him with all the &s;peed I could exert; but when
I made an effort to &s;peak, my tongue denied its
office; and &s;o lively was the expre&s;&s;ion of $word$
forrow in my countenance, that his
heart hard as it was) melted at &s;ight of my &s;uf|ferings,
which he well knew proceeded from the
&s;incerity of my love. At length I recovered the
u&s;e of &s;peech, enough to tell him, that I was
come to take my leave; and when I would have
proceeded, my voice failed me again: but, after
a con&s;iderable pau&s;e, I found means, with great
difficulty, to let him know how &s;en&s;ible I was of
my own incapacity to retrieve his lo&s;t affections;
but that I was willing (if po&s;&s;ible) to retain his
e&s;teem, of which, could I be a&s;&s;ured, I would
endeavour to compo&s;e my&s;elf; that I was deter|mined
to leave the kingdom, becau&s;e I could not
bear the &s;ight of tho&s;e places where we had been
&s;o happy in our mutual love; and that, till my
departure, I hoped he would vi&s;it me &s;ometimes,
that I might, by degrees, wean my&s;elf from his
company; for, I &s;hould not be able to &s;urvive the
&s;hock of being deprived of him all at once.</P>
<P>This addre&s;s may &s;eem very humble to an un|concerned
ob&s;erver; but love will tame the
proude&s;t di&s;po&s;ition, as plainly appeared in my
ca&s;e; for I had naturally as much &s;pirit, or more,
$word$ the generality of people have, Mr. S&mdash;
<PB N="130" REF="135">
was &s;o much confounded at the manner of my
behaviour, that he &s;carce knew what an&s;wer to
make; for (as he afterwards owned) he ex|pected
to hear him&s;elf upbraided; but he was not
proof again&s;t my tenderne&s;s. After &s;ome he&s;ita|tion,
he &s;aid he never meant to for&s;ake me in|tirely,
that his affection was &s;till unimpaired, and
that he would follow me directly to London. I
impo&s;ed upon my&s;elf, and believed what he &s;aid,
becau&s;e I could not bear to think of parting with
him for ever, and returned to town in a more
tranquil &s;tate of mind than that in which I had
left my father, though my heart was far from
being at ea&s;e; my fears being ingenious enough
to fore&s;ee, that I &s;hould never be able to overcome
his indifference.</P>
<P>I took lodgings in Mount-&s;treet, and my maid
having di&s;po&s;ed of her&s;elf in marriage, hired an|other,
who &s;upplied her place very much to my
&s;atisfaction; &s;he was a good girl, had a particular
attachment to me, and for many years, during
which &s;he lived in my &s;ervice, was indefatigably
a&s;&s;iduous in contributing to my ea&s;e, or rather,
in alleviating my affliction: for, though S&mdash;
came up to town according to promi&s;e, and re|newed
a &s;ort of corre&s;pondence with me for the
&s;pace of five months, his complai&s;ance would ex|tend
no farther; and he gave me to under&s;tand,
that he had determined to go abroad with Mr.
V&mdash;, whom he accordingly accompanied in his
envoy&s;hip to D&mdash;n.</P>
<P>I under&s;tood the real cau&s;e of this expedition,
which, notwith&s;tanding his oaths and prote&s;ta|tions
of unabated love and regard, I con&s;trued
into a palpable mark of di&s;like and di&s;re&s;pect; no$
could the repeated a&s;&s;urances I received from him
<PB N="131" REF="136">
in letters, mitigate the angui&s;h and mortification
that preyed upon my heart. I therefore gave up
all hopes of recovering the happine&s;s I had lo&s;t:
I told him, on the eve of his departure, that he
might exerci&s;e his gallantry a great while, before he
would meet with my fellow, in point of &s;incerity
and love; for I would rather have been a &s;ervant
in his hou&s;e, with the privilege of &s;eeing him,
than the queen of England, debarred of that
plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>When he took his leave, and went down &s;tairs,
I &s;hrunk at every &s;tep he made, as if a new
wound had been inflicted upon me; and when I
heard the door &s;hut behind him, my heart died
within me. (I had the &s;atisfaction to hear af|terwards,
he lamented the lo&s;s of me prodi|giou&s;ly,
and that he had never been &s;o happy
&s;ince.) I &s;at down to write a letter, in which
I forgave his indifference, becau&s;e I knew
the affections are altogether involuntary, and
wi&s;hed him all the happine&s;s he de&s;erved. I then
walked up and down the room in the mo&s;t re&s;t|le&s;s
anxiety, was put to bed by my maid, ro&s;e at
$word$, mounted my hor&s;e, and rode forty miles, in
order to fatigue my&s;elf, that I might, next night,
enjoy &s;ome repo&s;e. This exerci&s;e I daily under|went
for months together; and when it did not
an&s;wer my purpo&s;e, I u&s;ed to walk round Hyde|park
in the evening, when the place was qui e
&s;olitary, and unvi&s;ited by any other human crea|ture.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this melancholy perambula|tion,
I was one day acco&s;ted by a very great
man, who, after the fir&s;t &s;alutation, a&s;ked whe|ther
or not my intercour&s;e with S&mdash;was at a&s;|end;
and if I had any allowance from my hu&s;|band?
<PB N="132" REF="137">
To the fir&s;t of the&s;e que&s;tions I replied
in the affirmative; and to the la&s;t an&s;wered, that
my lord did not allow me a great deal; indeed I
might have truly &s;aid, nothing at all: but I was
too proud to own my indigence. He then ex|pre&s;&s;ed
his wonder, how one like me, who had
been u&s;ed to &s;plendor and affluence from my
cradle, could make &s;hift to live in my pre&s;ent
narrow circum&s;tances; and when I told him that
I could make a very good &s;hift, &s;o I had peace,
he &s;eemed to lament my &s;ituation, and very
kindly invited me to &s;up with his wife, at his
hou&s;e. I accepted the invitation, without any
apprehen&s;ion of the con&s;equence; and when I
went to the place, was introduced into an apart|ment,
magnificently lighted up (I &s;uppo&s;e) for
my reception.</P>
<P>After I had &s;tayed alone for &s;ome time in this
my&s;terious &s;ituation, without &s;eeing a living
&s;oul, my inviter appeared, and &s;aid, he hoped I
would not take it ami&s;s, that he and I were to
&s;up by our&s;elves, as he had &s;omething to &s;ay,
which could not be &s;o properly communicated
before company or &s;ervants. I then, for the
fir&s;t time, perceived his drift, to my no &s;mall
&s;urprize and indignation; and with evident marks
of di&s;plea&s;ure told him, I was &s;ure he had no|thing
to propo&s;e that would be agreeable to my
inclination, and that I would immediately leave
the hou&s;e. Upon which, he gave me to under|&s;tand,
that I could not po&s;&s;ibly retire, becau&s;e
he had &s;ent away my chair, and all his &s;ervants
were di&s;po&s;ed to obey his orders.</P>
<P>Incen&s;ed at this declaration, which I con&s;idered
as an in&s;ult, I an&s;wered with an air of re&s;olu|tion,
it was very well; I de&s;pi&s;ed his contrivance,
<PB N="133" REF="138">
and was afraid of nobody. Seeing me thus
alarmed, he a&s;&s;ured me I had no rea&s;on to be
afraid; that he had loved me long, and could
find no other opportunity of declaring his pa&s;&s;ion.
He &s;aid, the Q&mdash;had told him, that lord C&mdash;
had renewed his addre&s;&s;es to me; and as he un|der&s;tood
from my own mouth, my corre&s;pon|dence
with S&mdash;was ab&s;olutely broke off, he
thought him&s;elf as well intitled as another to my
regard. In conclu&s;ion, he told me, that I might
command his pur&s;e, and that he had power
enough to bring me into the world again with
<HI>$clat.</HI> To the&s;e advances I replied, that he was
very much mi&s;taken in his opinion of my cha|racter,
if he imagined I was to be won by any
temptations of fortune, and very frankly de|clared,
that I would rather give my&s;elf to a foot|man,
than &s;ell my&s;elf to a prince.</P>
<P>Supper being &s;erved, we &s;at down together;
but I would neither eat nor drink any thing,
except a little bread and water; for I was an odd
whim&s;ical girl; and it came into my head, that
$he might, perhaps, have mixed &s;omething in the
victuals or wine, which would alter my way of
thinking. In &s;hort, finding him&s;elf ba&s;&s;led in
all his endeavours, he permitted me, about twelve
o'clock, to depart in peace, and gave up his &s;uit,
as a de&s;perate cau&s;e.</P>
<P>This uncomfortable life did I lead for a whole
twelvemonth, without feeling the lea&s;t abatement
of my melancholy; and finding my&s;elf worn to
a &s;keleton, I re&s;umed my former re&s;olution of
trying to profit by change of place, and actually
went abroad with no other attendant but my wo|man,
and the utmo&s;t indifference for life. My
Intention was to have gone to the South of
<PB N="134" REF="139">
France, where I thought I could have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted
on the little I had left, which amounted to five
hundred pounds, until the i&s;&s;ue of my law-&s;uit,
by which I hoped to obtain &s;ome provi&s;ion from
my lord; and, without all doubt, my expecta|tion
would have been an&s;wered, had I put this
my plan in execution: but being at Paris, from
whence I purpo&s;ed to &s;et forward in a few days, I
&s;ent to Mr. K&mdash;, who had been formerly
intimate with my father, and &s;hewn me many ci|vilities
during my fir&s;t re&s;idence in France.</P>
<P>This gentleman favoured me with a vi&s;it, and
when I made him acquainted with my &s;cheme,
di&s;&s;uaded me from it, as an uncomfortable deter|mination,
and advi&s;ed me to &s;tay at Paris, where,
with good oeconomy, I could live as cheap as in any
other place, and enjoy the conver&s;ation and coun|tenance
of my friends, among which number re|declared
him&s;elf one of the mo&s;t faithful; a&s;&s;uring
me, that I &s;hould be always welcome to his table,
and want for nothing; and promi&s;ing to recom|mend
me as a lodger to a friend of his, with
whom I would live in a frugal and decent man|ner;
and that, as the woman was well known
and e&s;teemed by all the Engli&s;h company in Paris,
it would be the mo&s;t reputable &s;tep I could take,
(con&s;idering my youth and &s;ituation) to lodge
with a creditable per&s;on, who could an&s;wer for
my conduct. Thus per&s;uaded, I very &s;imply
followed his advice; I &s;ay &s;imply, becau&s;e, not|with&s;tanding
his repre&s;entations, I &s;oon found my
money melt away, without any pro&s;pect of
fre&s;h &s;upply. In lieu of this, however, I pa&s;&s;ed
my time very agreeably in &s;everal English
and &s;ome French families, where, in a $word$
<PB N="135" REF="140">
time, I became quite intimate, &s;aw a great deal
of company, and was treated with the utmo&s;t
politene&s;s and regard; yet, in the mid&s;t of the&s;e
plea&s;ures, many a melancholy &s;igh would ri&s;e at
the remembrance of my beloved S&mdash;, whom
for &s;everal years I could not recollect without
emotion; but time, company, amu&s;ements, and
change of place, in a great mea&s;ure di&s;&s;ipated
the&s;e ideas, and enabled me to bear my fate with
patience and re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>On my la&s;t arrival at Paris, I was &s;urrounded
by a croud of profe&s;&s;ed admirers, who &s;ighed and
flattered in the u&s;ual forms; but, be&s;ides that my
heart was not yet in a condition to contract new
engagements, I was prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed again&s;t them all,
by &s;uppo&s;ing that they pre&s;umed upon the know|ledge
of my indi&s;cretion with S&mdash;; and
therefore rejected their addre&s;&s;es with dete&s;tation
and di&s;dain: for, as I have already ob&s;erved, I
was not to be won, but by the appearance of
e&s;teem and the mo&s;t re&s;pectful carriage; and
though, by a fal&s;e &s;tep, I had, in my own opi|nion,
forfeited my title to the one, I was re&s;olved
to di&s;courage the advances of any man who &s;eemed
d$ficient in the other.</P>
<P>In this manner, my lovers were, one by one,
repul&s;ed, almo&s;t as &s;oon as they pre&s;ented them|&s;elves,
and I pre&s;erved the independance of my
heart, until I became acquainted with a certain
peer, whom I often &s;aw at the hou&s;e of Mrs.
P&mdash;, an Engli&s;h lady then re&s;ident at Paris.
This young nobleman profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf deeply
cram u&s;ed of me, in a &s;tile &s;o different from that
of my other admirers, that I heard $word$
were without di&s;gu&s;t; and though my inclinations
$word$ &s;till free, could not find in my heart to
$$$countenance his addre&s;&s;es, which were pre|ferred
<PB N="136" REF="141">
with the mo&s;t engaging mode&s;ty, di&s;in|tere&s;tedne&s;s
and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>By the&s;e never-failing arts, he gradually con|quered
my indifference, and gained the preference
in my e&s;teem from lord C&mdash;y and the prince
of C&mdash;, who were at that time his rivals.
But what contributed (more than any con&s;idera|tion)
to his &s;ucce&s;s, was his declaring openly,
that he would marry me without he&s;itation, as
&s;oon as I could obtain a divorce from my pre&s;ent
hu&s;band, which, in all probability, might have
been ea&s;ily procured; for before I left England,
lord&mdash;had offered me five thou&s;and pounds,
if I would con&s;ent to &s;uch a mutual relea&s;e, that
he might be at liberty to e&s;pou&s;e one Mi&s;s W&mdash;
of Kent, to whom be then made love upon ho|nourable
terms: but I was fool enough to refu&s;e
his propo&s;al, by the advice of S&mdash;: and whe|ther
or not his lord&s;hip finding it impracticable to
wed his new mi&s;tre&s;s, began to make love upon
another footing, I know not; but certain it is,
the mother forbad him the hou&s;e, a circum&s;tance
which he took &s;o heinou&s;ly ill, that he appealed
to the world in a public adverti&s;ement, begin|ning
with, <HI>Whereas, for &s;ome time, I have pa&s;|&s;ionatcly
loved Mi&s;s</HI> W&mdash;, <HI>and upon my $word$
complying with the mother's propo&s;als, they have
earned me out of doors; this is to ju&s;tify,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>This declaration, &s;igned with his name, was
actually printed in a number of detached adver|ti&s;ements,
which he ordered to be di&s;tributed to
the public; and afterwards, being convinced by
&s;ome of his friends, that he had done a very filly
thing, he recalled them at half a guinea apiece.
A copy of one of them was &s;ent to me at Paris,
and I believe my father has now one of the or|ginals
in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. After this wi&s;e vindica|tion
<PB N="137" REF="142">
of his conduct, he made an attempt to carry
off the lady from church, by force of arms; but
&s;he was re&s;ecued by the neighbours, headed by her
brother who being an attorney, had like to have
made his lord&s;hip &s;mart &s;everely for this explort.</P>
<P>Mean while, my new admirer had made &s;ome
progre&s;s in my heart; and my finances being $word$,
I was reduced to the alternative of $word$
to lord&mdash;again, or accepting earl
B&mdash;$s love. When my affairs were brought
to that i&s;&s;ue, I made no he&s;itation in my choice,
putting my&s;elf under the protection of a man of
honour, whom I e&s;teemed, rather than &s;uffer
every &s;ort of mortification, from a per&s;on who
was the object of my abhorrence and contempt.
From a mi&s;taken pride, I cho&s;e to live in lord
B&mdash;k's hou&s;e, rather than be maintained at his
expence in any other place. We &s;pent &s;everal
months agreeably in balls and other diver&s;ions, vi|&s;ited
lord B&mdash;k, who lived at the di&s;tance of a few
kagues from Paris, and &s;taved &s;ome days at $word$
$word$ where the entertainment was, in all re&s;pect,
delightful, elegant, and refined. Their habitation
was the rendezvous of the be&s;t company in
France; and lady B&mdash;k maintained the &s;ame &s;u|periority
in her own &s;ex, for which her lord is
&s;o ju&s;tly di&s;tingui&s;hed among the men.</P>
<P>About Chri&s;tmas we &s;et out for England, ac|companied
by a little North Briton, who lived
with lord B&mdash;as his companion, and did not
at all approve of our corre&s;pondence; whether
out of real friend&s;hip for his patron, or appre|hen&s;ion
that in time I might &s;uper&s;ede his own
influence with my lord, I &s;hall not pretend to
determine. Be that as it will, the fro&s;t was &s;o
&s;evere, that we were detained ten days at Calais,
before we could get out of the harbour; and
<PB N="133" REF="143">
during that time, I reflected &s;eriou&s;ly on what
my new lover had propo&s;ed: as he was very
young, and unacquainted with the world, I
thought my &s;tory might have e&s;caped him; and
therefore determined to give him a faithful detail
of the whole, that he might not have any thing
to reproach me with in the &s;equel; be&s;ides, I did
not think it hone&s;t to engage him to do more
for me than he might afterwards, perhaps, think
I was worth. Accordingly, I communicated to
him every particular of my life; and the narra|tion,
far from altering his &s;entiments, rather
confirmed his good opinion, by exhibiting an
undoubted proof of my frankne&s;s and &s;incerity.
In &s;hort, he behaved with &s;uch genero&s;ity, as
made an ab&s;olute conque&s;t of my heart: but my
love was of a different kind from that which had
formerly reigned within my brea&s;t, being founded
upon the warme&s;t gratitude and e&s;teem, exclu|&s;ive
of any other con&s;ideration, though his per&s;on
was very agreeable, and his addre&s;s engaging.</P>
<P>When we arrived in England, I went directly
to his country-&s;eat, about twelve miles from
London, where he &s;oon joined me, and we
lived &s;ome time in perfect retirement, his relations
being greatly alarmed with the apprehen&s;ion that
lord&mdash;would bring an action again&s;t him;
though he him&s;elf de&s;ired nothing more, and
lived &s;o ea&s;ily under that expectation, that they
&s;oon laid a&s;ide their fears on his account.</P>
<P>We were vi&s;ited by Mr. H&mdash;B&mdash;, a re|lation
of my lord, and one Mr. R&mdash;of the
guards, who, with the little Scotch gentleman
and my lover, made an agreeable &s;et, among
whom I enjoyed hunting, and all manner of
country diver&s;ions. As to Mr. H&mdash;B&mdash;
<PB N="139" REF="144">
if ever there was perfection in one man, it cen|tered
in him; or at lea&s;t, he, of all the men I
ever knew, approached neare&s;t to that idea which
I had conceived of a perfect character. He was
both good and great, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an uncommon
genius and the be&s;t of hearts. Mr. R&mdash;was a
very &s;ociable man, had a good per&s;on and culti|vated
under&s;tanding; and my lord was exce&s;&s;ively
good humoured; &s;o that, with &s;uch companions,
no place could be dull or in&s;ipid: for my own
part, I conducted the family; and as I endea|voured
to plea&s;e and make every body hap|py,
I had the good fortune to &s;ucceed. Mr. B&mdash;
told me, that before he &s;aw me, he heard I was
a f$ol; but finding (as he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay)
that I had been egregiou&s;ly mi&s;repre&s;ented, he
courted my friend&s;hip, and a corre&s;pondence com|menced
between us: indeed, it was impo&s;&s;ible
for any per&s;on to know him, without entertain|ing
the utmo&s;t e&s;teem and veneration for his
virtue.</P>
<P>After I had lived &s;ome time in this agreeable
retreat, my husband began to make a bu&s;tle: he
&s;ent a me&s;&s;age, demanding me from lord B&mdash;;
then came in per&s;on, with his night-cap in his
pocket, intending to have &s;tayed all night, had
he been a&s;ked, and attended by a relation, whom
he a&s;&s;ured that I was very fond of him, and de|tained
by force from his arms.</P>
<P>Finding him&s;elf di&s;appointed in his expecta|tions,
he commenced a law-&s;uit again&s;t lord B&mdash;,
though not for a divorce, as we de&s;ired, but
with a view to reclaim me as his lawful wife.
His lawyers, however, attempted to prove cri|minal
conver&s;ation, in hopes of extorting money
from my lover; but their endeavours were alto|gether
<PB N="140" REF="145">
fruitle&s;s; for no &s;ervant of lord B&mdash;'s
or mine, could with ju&s;tice &s;ay, we were ever
&s;een to tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t mode&s;ty and decorum; &s;o
that the plaintiff was non&s;uited.</P>
<P>While this cau&s;e was depending, all my lo|ver's
friends expre&s;&s;ed fear and concern for the
i&s;&s;ue, while he him&s;elf behaved with the utmo&s;t
re&s;olution, and gave me &s;uch convincing proofs
of a &s;trong and &s;teady affection, as augmented
my gratitude, and rivetted the ties of my love,
which was unblemi&s;hed, faithful and &s;incere.</P>
<P>Soon after this event, I was &s;eized with a vio|lent
fit of illne&s;s, in which I was vi&s;ited by my
father, and attended by two phy&s;icians, one of
whom de&s;paried of my life, and took his leave
accordingly; but Dr. S&mdash;, who was the other,
$word$ in his attendance, and, in all human
appearance, &s;aved my life; a circum&s;tance by
which he acquired a great &s;hare of reputation:
yet, notwith&s;tanding all his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I was con|fined
to my bed for ten weeks; during which,
lord B&mdash;'s grief was immoderate, his care and
genero&s;ity unlimited. Whil&s;t I lay in this ex|tremity,
Mr. S&mdash;, penetrated by my melan|choly
condition, which revived his tenderne&s;s,
begg'd leave to be admitted to my pre&s;ence; and
lord B&mdash;would have complied with his re|que&s;t,
had I not been judged too weak to beat
the &s;hock of &s;uch an interview. My con&s;titu|tion,
however, agreeably di&s;appointed their fears;
and the fever had no &s;ooner left me, than I was
removed to a hunting &s;eat belonging to my lover,
from whence, after I had recovered my &s;trength,
we went to B&mdash;Ca&s;tle, where we kept open
hou&s;e: and while we remained at this place, lord
B&mdash;received a letter from lord&mdash;, $word$
<PB N="141" REF="146">
in November, challenging him to &s;ingle combat
in May, upon the frontiers of France and Flan|ders.
This defiance was &s;ent in con&s;equence of
what had pa&s;&s;ed betwixt them long before my in|di&s;po&s;ition,
at a meeting in a certain tavern, where
they quarrelled, and in the fray my lover threw
his antagoni&s;t under the table. I coun&s;elled him
to take no notice of this rhodomontade, which I
knew was void of all intention of performance;
and he was wi&s;e enough to follow my advice;
re&s;olved, however, &s;hould the me&s;&s;age be re|peated,
to take the challenger at his word.</P>
<P>Having re&s;ided &s;ome time in this place, we re|turned
to the other country-hou&s;e which we had
kit, where lord B&mdash;addicted him&s;elf &s;o much
to hunting, and other male diver&s;ions, that I be|gan
to think he neglected me, and apprized him
of my &s;u&s;picion; a&s;&s;uring him, at the &s;ame time,
that I would leave him as &s;oon as my opinion
&s;hould be confirmed.</P>
<P>This declaration had no effect upon his beha|viour,
which became &s;o remarkably cold, that
$word$ Mr. R&mdash;, who lived with us, imagined
that his affection was palpably dimini&s;hed. When
&s;went to town, I was u&s;ually attended by his
cou&s;in, or this gentleman, or both, but &s;eldom
favoured with his company; nay, when I repair|ed
to Bath, for the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of my health,
he permitted me to go alone; &s;o that I was quite
per&s;uaded of his indifference; and yet, I was mi&s;|taken
in my opinion: but, I had been &s;poiled by
the behaviour of my fir&s;t husband, and Mr. S&mdash;,
$word$ never quitted me for the &s;ake of any a|mu&s;ement,
and often re&s;i&s;ted the calls of the mo&s;t
$word$ bu&s;ine&s;s, rather than part from me, tho'
but for a few hours. I thought every man who
<PB N="142" REF="147">
loved me truly, would act in the &s;ame manner;
and whether I am right or wrong in my conjec|tures,
I leave wi&s;er ca&s;ui&s;ts to judge. Certain it
is, &s;uch &s;acrifice and devotion is the mo&s;t plea&s;ing
proof of an admirer's pa&s;&s;ion; and <HI>Voyez $word$
plus &s;ouvent, &amp; ne m&eacute; donnez rien,</HI> is one of my
favourite maxims. A man may give money, be|cau&s;e
he is profu&s;e; he may be violently fond, be|cau&s;e
he is of a &s;anguine con&s;titution; but if he
gives me his time, he gives me an unque&s;tionable
proof of my being in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his heart.</P>
<P>My appearance at Bath, without the company
of lord B&mdash;, occa&s;ioned a general &s;urprize, and
encouraged the men to pe&s;ter me with addre&s;&s;es;
every new admirer endeavouring to advance his
&s;uit, by demon&s;trating the unkind and di&s;re&s;pect|ful
behaviour of his lord&s;hip. Indeed, this was
the mo&s;t effectual &s;tring they could touch: my
pride and re&s;entment were alarmed, and I was
weak enough to li&s;ten to one man, who had like
to have in&s;inuated him&s;elf into my inclinations.
He was tall and large boned, with white hair, in|clining
to what is called &s;andy, and had the repu|tation
of being hand&s;ome, tho' I think he &s;carce
de&s;erved that epithet. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a large for|tune,
loved mi&s;chief, and &s;tuck at nothing for the
accompli&s;hment of his de&s;igns; one of his chief
plea&s;ures, being that of &s;etting any two lovers at
variance. He employed his addre&s;s upon me with
great a&s;&s;iduity, and knew &s;o well how to manage
my re&s;entment, that I was plea&s;ed with his man|ner,
heard his vows without di&s;gu&s;t, and, in a
word, promi&s;ed to deliberate with my&s;elf upon
his propo&s;als, and give him an account of my
determination in writing.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="148">
Thus re&s;olved, I went to lord B&mdash;, in Wilt|&s;hire,
whither I was followed by this pretender to
my heart, who vi&s;ited us on the footing of an ac|quaintance;
but when I reflected on what I had
done, I condemned my own conduct, as indi&s;|creet,
though nothing deci&s;ive had pa&s;&s;ed between
us, and began to hate him in proportion to the
&s;elf-conviction I felt; perceiving that I had in|volved
my&s;elf in a difficulty from which I &s;hould
not be ea&s;ily di&s;engaged. For the pre&s;ent, how|ever,
I found means to po&s;tpone my declaration;
he admitted my excu&s;e, and I returned to Lon|don
with lord B&mdash;, who was again &s;ummoned
to the field by his former challenger.</P>
<P>H&mdash;d&mdash;n, governor, coun&s;ellor, and &s;teward
to this little hero, came to lord B&mdash;with a ver|bal
me&s;&s;age, importing, that his lord&s;hip had
changed his mind about going to Flanders, but
expected to meet him, on &s;uch a day and hour,
in the burying-ground near Red-lion-&s;quare.
Lord B&mdash;accepted the challenge, and gave me
an account of what had pa&s;&s;ed; but he had been
anticipated by the me&s;&s;enger, who had already
tried to alarm my fears, from the con&s;ideration of
the con&s;equence, that I might take &s;ome mea&s;ures
to prevent their meeting. But I perceived his
drift, and told him plainly that lord&mdash;had
no intention to ri&s;que his per&s;on, tho' he endea|voured
with all his might to per&s;uade me, that his
principal was de&s;perate and determined. I knew
my little husband too well, to think he would
bring matters to any dangerous i&s;&s;ue, and was ap|prehen&s;ive
of nothing but &s;oul play, from the vil|lainy
of H&mdash;n, with which I was equally well
acquainted. Indeed I &s;ignified my doubts on that
&s;core to Mr. H&mdash;, who would have attended
<PB N="144" REF="149">
his kin&s;man to the field, had he not thought he
might be liable to cen&s;ure, if any thing &s;hould
happen to lord B&mdash;, becau&s;e he him&s;elf was
heir at law: for that rea&s;on, he judiciou&s;ly de|clined
being per&s;onally concerned; and we pitched
upon the earl of A&mdash;, his lord&s;hip's uncle, who
willingly undertook the office.</P>
<P>At the appointed time they went to the place
of rendezvous, where they had not waited long
when the challenger appeared, in a new pink &s;a|tin
wai&s;tcoat, which he had put on for the oc|ca&s;&s;ion,
with his &s;word under his arm, and his
&s;teward by him, leaving, in an hackney coach,
at &s;ome di&s;tance, a &s;urgeon whom he had pro|vided
for the care of his per&s;on. Thus equipped,
he advanced to his antagoni&s;t, and de&s;ired him to
choo&s;e his ground; upon which lord B&mdash;told
him, that if he mu&s;t fall, it was not material
which grave he &s;hould tumble over.</P>
<P>Our little hero finding him &s;o joco&s;e and de|termined,
turned to lord A&mdash;, and de&s;ired to
&s;peak with him, that he might di&s;burden his con|&s;cience
before they &s;hould begin the work of
death. They accordingly went a&s;ide; and he
gave him to under&s;tand, that his motive for
fighting was lord B&mdash;'s detaining his wife from
him, by compul&s;ion. The earl of A&mdash;a&s;&s;ured
him, he was egregiou&s;ly mi&s;taken in his con|jecture;
that his nephew u&s;ed no force or uncue
influence, to keep me in his hou&s;e; but it could
not be expected that he would turn me out or
doors.</P>
<P>This explanation was altogether &s;atisfactory
to lord&mdash;, who &s;aid he was far from being to
unrea&s;onable as to expect lord B&mdash;would com|mit
&s;uch a breach of ho&s;pitality; and all he de|&s;ired
<PB N="145" REF="150">
was, that his wife &s;hould be left to her own
inclinations. Upon the&s;e articles peace was con|cluded,
and they parted without blood&s;hed. At lea&s;t
the&s;e are the particulars of the &s;tory, as they were
related by lord A&mdash;, with whom I laugh'd
heartily at the adventure; for I never doubted
that the challenger would find &s;ome expedient to
prevent the duel, tho' I wondered how he mu&s;|tered
up re&s;olution enough to carry it &s;o far.</P>
<P>That he might not, however, give us any
more trouble, we re&s;olved to go and enjoy our|&s;elves
in France, whither I went by my&s;elf, in
hopes of being &s;oon joined by my lover, who was
obliged to &s;tay &s;ome time longer in England, to
&s;ettle his affairs. He was &s;o much affected at our
parting (tho' but for a few weeks) that he was
mo&s;t di&s;tracted; and this affliction renewed my
renderne&s;s for him, becau&s;e it was an undoubted
proof of his love. I wrote to him every po&s;t
from France; and, as I had no &s;ecrets, de&s;ired
$m to take care of all the letters that &s;hould
come to his hou&s;e, directed to me, after my parture
from England.</P>
<P>This was an unfortunate office for him, in the
$$$cution of which he chanced to open a letter
from Sir T&mdash;A&mdash;, with whom (as I have al|ready
ob&s;erved) I had &s;ome corre&s;pondence at
Path. I had, according to my promi&s;e, given
the gentleman a deci&s;ive an&s;wer, importing, that
$word$ determined to remain in my pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion,
but as lord B&mdash;was ignorant of my &s;enti|ments
in that particular, and perceived from the
better that &s;omething extraordinary had pa&s;&s;ed be|tween
us, and that I was earne&s;tly &s;ollicited to
have him, he was &s;eized with the utmo&s;t con&s;ter|$ation
and concern; and having previou&s;ly ob|tained
<PB N="146" REF="151">
the king's leave to go abroad, &s;et out that
very night for France, leaving his affairs in the
greate&s;t confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Sir T&mdash;A&mdash;hearing I was gone, without
under&s;tanding the cau&s;e of my departure, took
the &s;ame rout, and both arrived at Dover next
day. They heard of each other's motions:
each bribed the ma&s;ter of a packet-boat to tran&s;|port
him with expedition; but that depending
upon the wind, both reached Calais at the &s;ame
time, tho' in different ve&s;&s;els. Sir T&mdash;&s;ent his
valet de chambre, po&s;t, with a letter, intreating
me to accompany him into Italy, where he
would make me mi&s;tre&s;s of his whole fortune, and
to &s;et out directly for that country, that he might
not lo&s;e me by the arrival of lord B&mdash;, promi&s;ing
to join me on the road, if I would con&s;ent to
make him happy. I &s;ent his me&s;&s;enger back with
an an&s;wer, wherein I expre&s;&s;ed &s;urprize at his
propo&s;als, after having &s;ignified my re&s;olution to
him before I left England; and he was &s;carce
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, when I received another letter from
lord B&mdash;, be&s;eeching me to meet him at Cler|mont,
upon the road from Calais; and conjuring
me to avoid the &s;ight of his rival, &s;hould he get
the &s;tart of him in travelling. This, however,
was not likely to be the ca&s;e, as lord B&mdash;rode
po&s;t, and the other was, by his corpulence,
obliged to travel in a chai&s;e; yet, that I might
not increa&s;e his anxiety, I left Paris immediately
on the receit of his me&s;&s;age, and met him at the
appointed place, where he received me with all
the agitation of joy and fear, and a&s;ked if I had
ever encouraged Sir T&mdash;A&mdash;in his addre&s;&s;es. I
very candidly told him the whole tran&s;action, at
which he was incen&s;ed; but his indignation was
<PB N="147" REF="152">
&s;oon appea&s;ed, when I profe&s;&s;ed my penitence,
and a&s;&s;ured him, that I had totally rejected his
rival. Not that I approve of my behaviour to
Sir T&mdash;who (I own) was ill u&s;ed in this affair;
but &s;urely it was more excu&s;able to halt here, than
proceed farther in my indi&s;cretion.</P>
<P>My lover being &s;atisfied with my declaration,
we went together to Paris, being attended by
the Scotchman whom I have already mentioned,
tho' I believe he was not over and above well
plea&s;ed to &s;ee matters thus amicably compro|mi&s;ed.
The furious knight followed us to the
capital; in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;eeing me in per&s;on; told
this North Briton, that I was actually engaged
to him; wrote every hour, and railed at my per|&s;idious
conduct. I took no notice of the&s;e deli|rious
tran&s;ports, which were al&s;o di&s;regarded by
lord B&mdash;, till one night he was exa&s;perated by
the in&s;inuations of Mr. C&mdash;, who, I believe, in|flamed
his jealou&s;y, by hinting a &s;u&s;picion that I
was really in love with his rival. What pa&s;&s;ed
betwixt them I know not, but he &s;ent for me
from the opera, by a phy&s;ician of Paris, who was
a &s;ort of go-between among us all, and who told
me, that if I did not come home on the in&s;tant,
a deal would be fought on my account.</P>
<P>I was very much &s;hocked at this information;
but by being u&s;ed to alarms from the behaviour
of lord&mdash;, I had acquired a pretty good &s;hare of
re&s;olution, and with great compo&s;ure entered the
room where lord B&mdash;was, with his companion,
whom I immediately ordered to withdraw. I
then gave his lord&s;hip to under&s;tand, that I was
unformed of what had pa&s;&s;ed, and thought my|&s;elf
&s;o much injured by the per&s;on who had ju&s;t
<PB N="148" REF="153">
quitted the apartment, that I would no longer
live under the &s;ame roof with him.</P>
<P>Lord B&mdash;raved like a bedlamite, taxing me
with want of candour and affection; but I ea&s;ily
ju&s;tified my own integrity, and gave him &s;uch a&s;|&s;urances
of my love, that his jealou&s;y &s;ub&s;idee,
and his &s;pirits were recompo&s;ed. Neverthele&s;s
I in&s;i&s;ted upon his di&s;mi&s;&s;ing Mr. C&mdash;, on pain
of my leaving the hou&s;e, as I could not help
thinking he had u&s;ed his endeavours to prejudice
me in the opinion of my lord. If his conduct
was the re&s;ult of friend&s;hip for his patron, he
certainly acted the part of an hone&s;t and tru&s;ty
adherent. But I could not ea&s;ily forgive him,
becau&s;e, a few weeks before, he had, by my in|tere&s;t,
obtained a con&s;iderable addition to his al|lowance;
and even after the &s;teps he had taken
to di&s;oblige me, I was not &s;o much his enemy
but that I prevailed upon lord B&mdash;to double his
&s;alary, that his leaving the family might be no
detriment to his fortune.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip having complied with my de|mand,
this gentleman, after having &s;tayed three
days in the hou&s;e, to prepare for his departure,
during which I would not &s;uffer him to be ad|mitted
into my pre&s;ence, made his retreat with a
fine young girl who was my companion; and I
have never &s;een him &s;ince that time.</P>
<P>Sir T&mdash;&s;till continued furious, and would not
take a denial, except from my own mouth; up|on
which, with the approbation of lord B&mdash;, I
indulged him with an interview. He entered
the apartment with a &s;tern countenance, and told
me I had us'd him $ll. I pleaded guilty to the
charge, and begg'd his pardon accordingly. I
attempted to rea&s;on the ca&s;e with him, but he
<PB N="149" REF="154">
would hear no arguments except his own, and
even tried to intimidate me with threats; which
provoked me to &s;uch a degree, that I defied his
vengeance, telling him that I feared nothing but
the reproach of my own con&s;cience; that tho' I
had acted a &s;imple part, he dur&s;t not &s;ay there
was any thing criminal in my conduct; and
that, from his pre&s;ent frantic and unju&s;t beha|viour,
I thought my&s;elf happy in having e&s;caped
him. He &s;wore I was the mo&s;t inflexible of all
creatures, a&s;ked if nothing would move me?
and when I an&s;wered, &startq;Nothing,&endq; took his
$eave, and never afterwards per&s;ecuted me with
$word$ addre&s;&s;es; tho' I have heard he was vain and
$word$ enough to boa&s;t of favours, which, upon my
honour, he never received, as he him&s;elf, at one
time, owned to doctor Cantwell at Paris.</P>
<P>While he underwent all this frenzy and di|&s;traction
upon my account, he was loved
with the &s;ame violence of pa&s;&s;ion by a certain
Scotch lady of quality, who, when he followed
me to France, pur&s;ued him thither with the
&s;ame eagerne&s;s and expedition; and, far from
being jealous of me as a rival, us'd to come to
my hou&s;e, implore my good offices with the ob|ject
of her love, and laying her&s;elf on the floor at
full length, before the fire, weep and cry like a
per&s;on $ere&s;t of her &s;en&s;es. She bitterly com|plained,
that he had never obliged her but once;
and begg'd, with the mo&s;t earne&s;t &s;upplications,
that I would give her an opportunity of &s;eeing
him at my hou&s;e. But I thought proper to
avoid her company, as &s;oon as I perceived her
intention.</P>
<P>We continued at Paris for &s;ome time, during
$word$ I contracted an acquaintance with the
<PB N="150" REF="155">
&s;i&s;ter of madam la T&mdash;. She was the &s;uppo&s;ed
mi&s;tre&s;s of the prince of C&mdash;, endowed with a
great &s;hare of under&s;tanding, and loved plea&s;ure
to exce&s;s, tho' &s;he maintained her reputation on
a re&s;pectable footing, by living with her hu&s;band
and mother. This lady, perceiving that I had
in&s;pired her lover with a pa&s;&s;ion, which gave me
unea&s;ine&s;s on her account, actually practi&s;ed all
her eloquence and art, in per&s;uading me to li&s;ten
to his love; for it was a maxim with her, to
plea&s;e him at any rate. I was &s;hocked at her
indelicate complai&s;ance, and rejected the propo|&s;al,
as repugnant to my pre&s;ent engagement,
which I held as &s;acred as any nuptial tie, and
much more binding than a forced or unnatural
marriage.</P>
<P>Upon our return to England we lived in great
harmony and peace; and nothing was wanting to
my happine&s;s, but the one thing to me mo&s;t need|ful;
I mean the inchanting tenderne&s;s and de|lightful
enthu&s;ia&s;m of love. Lord B&mdash;'s heart (I
believe) felt the &s;oft impre&s;&s;ions; and, for my
own part, I loved him with the mo&s;t faithful af|fection.
It is not enough to &s;ay I wi&s;hed him
well; I had the mo&s;t delicate, the mo&s;t genuine
e&s;teem for his virtue, I had an intimate regard and
anxiety for his intere&s;t, and felt for him as if he
had been my own &s;on: but &s;till there was a va|cancy
in my heart; there was not that fervour,
that tran&s;port, that ec&s;ta&s;y of pa&s;&s;ion which I had
formerly known; my bo&s;om was not filled with
the little deity; I could not help recalling to my
remembrance the fond, the ravi&s;hing moments
had pa&s;&s;ed with S&mdash;; and had I under&s;tood the
conditions of life, tho&s;e plea&s;ures were happdy
exchanged for my pre&s;ent &s;ituation, becau&s;e, if
<PB N="151" REF="156">
I was now deprived of tho&s;e rapturous enjoy|ments,
I was al&s;o exempted from the cares and
anxiety that attended them; but I was generally
extravagant in my notions of happine&s;s, and
therefore con&s;trued my pre&s;ent tranquillity into
an in&s;ipid languor and &s;tagnation of life.</P>
<P>While I remained in this inactivity of &s;enti|ment,
lord&mdash;having received a very con&s;i|derable
addition to his fortune, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to
me, promi&s;ing, that if I would leave lord B&mdash;,
he would make me a pre&s;ent of an hou&s;e and
furniture, where I &s;hould live at my ea&s;e, with|out
being expo&s;ed to his vi&s;its, except when I
&s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to receive them. This pro|po&s;al
he made, in con&s;equence of what I had
always declared, namely, that if he had not re|duced
me to the nece&s;&s;ity of putting my&s;elf under
the protection of &s;ome per&s;on or other, by de|priving
me of any other means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, I
&s;hould never have given the world the lea&s;t cau&s;e
to &s;candalize my reputation; and that I would
withdraw my&s;elf from my pre&s;ent dependance,
as &s;oon as he &s;hould enable me to live by my&s;elf.
I was therefore re&s;olved to be as good as my
word, and accepted his offer, on condition that
I &s;hould be wholly at my own di&s;po&s;al, and that
he &s;hould never enter my door but as a vi&s;itant
or common friend.</P>
<P>The&s;e articles being &s;anctioned by his word
and honour (the value of which I did not then
know) an hou&s;e was furni&s;hed according to my
directions; and I &s;ignified my intention to lord
B&mdash;, who con&s;ented to my removal, with this
pro$$&s;o, that I &s;hould continue to &s;ee him. I
wrote al&s;o to his relation Mr. B&mdash;, who, in his
an&s;wer, ob&s;erved, that it was too late to advi&s;e
<PB N="152" REF="157">
when I was actually determined. All my friends
and acquaintance approved of the &s;cheme, tho' it
was one of the mo&s;t unju&s;tifiable &s;teps I had ever
taken, being a real act of ingratitude to my be|nefactor;
which I &s;oon did, and always &s;hall re|gret
and condemn. So little is the world quali|fied
to judge of private affairs!</P>
<P>When the time of our parting drew near, lord
B&mdash;became gloomy and di&s;contented, and even
intreated me to po&s;tpone my re&s;olution; but I
told him, that now every thing was prepared for
my reception, I could not retract without in|curring
the imputation of folly and extravagance.
On the very day of my departure Mr. B&mdash;en|deavoured,
with all the arguments he could &s;ug|ge&s;t,
to di&s;&s;uade me from my purpo&s;e; and I
made u&s;e of the &s;ame an&s;wer which had &s;atisfied
his friend. Finding me determined upon re|moving,
he bur&s;t out into a flood of tears, ex|claiming,
&startq;By G&mdash;d, if lord B&mdash;can bear
it, I can't.&endq; I was thunder&s;truck at this ex|pre&s;&s;ion;
for tho' I had been told that Mr. B&mdash;
was in love with me, I gave no credit to the re|port,
becau&s;e he had never declared his pa&s;&s;ion,
and this was the fir&s;t hint of it that ever e&s;caped
him in my hearing. I was therefore &s;o much
amazed at the circum&s;tance of this abrupt expla|nation,
that I could make no an&s;wer; but hav|ing
taken my leave, went away, ruminating on
the unfore&s;een event.</P>
<P>Lord B&mdash;(as I was informed) &s;poke not a
word that whole night, and took my leaving him
&s;o much to heart, that two years clap&s;ed before
he got the better of his grief. This intelligence
I afterwards received from his own mouth, and
a&s;ked his forgivene&s;s for my unkind retreat, tho'
<PB N="153" REF="158">
I &s;hall never be able to obtain my own. As for
Mr. B&mdash;, he was overwhelmed with &s;orrow, and
made &s;uch efforts to &s;uppre&s;s his concern, as had
well nigh co&s;t him his life. Dr. S&mdash;was called
to him in the middle of the night, and found him
almo&s;t &s;uffocated. He &s;oon gue&s;&s;ed the cau&s;e,
when he under&s;tood that I had left the hou&s;e:
&s;o that I my&s;elf was the only per&s;on concerned
who was utterly ignorant of his affection; for I
&s;olemnly declare he never gave me the lea&s;t rea|&s;on
to &s;u&s;pect it while I lived with his relation,
becau&s;e he had too much honour to entertain a
thought of &s;upplanting his friend, and too good
an opinion of me to believe he &s;hould have &s;uc|ceeded
in the attempt. Tho' my love for lord B&mdash;
was not &s;o tender and intere&s;ting as the pa&s;&s;ion I
had felt for S&mdash;, my fidelity was inviolable,
and I never harboured the mo&s;t di&s;tant thought
of any other per&s;on, till after I had re&s;olved to
leave him, when (I own) I afforded &s;ome &s;mall
encouragement to the addre&s;&s;es of a new admirer,
by telling him, that I &s;hould, in a little time, be
my own mi&s;tre&s;s, tho' I was not now at my own
di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P>I enjoyed my new hou&s;e as a little paradi&s;e:
it was accommodated with all &s;orts of conve|niences;
every thing was new, and therefore
plea&s;ing, and the whole ab&s;olutely at my com|mand.
I had the company of a relation, a very
good woman, with whom I lived in the mo&s;t
$word$ manner; was vi&s;ited by the be&s;t people
in town. I mean the&s;e of the male &s;ex, the la|dies
having long ago for&s;aken me;) I frequented
all reputable places of publick entertainment, and
had a concert at home once a week: &s;o that my
$word$ on in happine&s;s and quiet, till all my
<PB N="154" REF="159">
&s;weets were imbittered by the vexatious behaviour
of my hu&s;band, who began to importune me
again to live with him; and by the increa&s;ing
anxiety of lord B&mdash;, who (tho' I &s;till admitted
his vi&s;its) plainly perceived that I wanted to re|linqui&s;h
his corre&s;pondence. This di&s;covery
rai&s;ed &s;uch tempe&s;ts of jealou&s;y and de&s;pair with|in
his brea&s;t, that he kept me in continual
alarms: he &s;ent me&s;&s;ages to me every hour, &s;ign|ed
his letters with his own blood, raved like a
man in an ec&s;ta&s;y of madne&s;s, railed at my in|gratitude,
and prai&s;ed my conduct, by turns;
offered to &s;acrifice every thing for my love, to
leave the kingdom forthwith, and live with me
for ever in any part of the world where I &s;hould
choo&s;e to re&s;ide.</P>
<P>The&s;e were generous and tempting propo&s;als;
but I was be&s;et with coun&s;ellors who were not to|tally
di&s;intere&s;ted, and who di&s;&s;uaded me from
embracing the proffers of my lover, on pretence
that lord&mdash;would be highly injured by my
compliance. I li&s;tened to their advice, and har|dened
my heart again&s;t lord B&mdash;'s &s;orrow and &s;o|licitations.
My behaviour on this occa&s;ion is al|together
unaccountable; this was the only time
that ever I was a &s;lave to admonition. The con|dition
of lord B&mdash;would have melted any heart
but mine, and yet mine was one of the mo&s;t &s;en|&s;ible:
he employed his cou&s;in as an advocate with
me, till that gentleman actually refu&s;ed the office,
telling him candidly, that his own inclination,
were too much engaged, to permit him to per|form
the ta&s;k with fidelity and truth. He ac|cordingly
re&s;olved to avoid my pre&s;ence, until my
lord and I &s;hould come to &s;ome final determina|tion,
which was greatly retarded by the per&s;eve|rance
<PB N="155" REF="160">
of his lord&s;hip, who would not re&s;ign his
hopes even when I pretended that another man
had engaged my heart, but &s;aid, that in time my
affection might return.</P>
<P>Our corre&s;pondence, however, gradually wore
off; upon which Mr. B&mdash;renewed his vi&s;its, and
many agreeable and happy hours we pa&s;&s;ed toge|ther.
Not that he, or any other per&s;on whom I
now &s;aw, &s;ucceeded to the privilege of a fortu|nate
lover: I knew he loved me to madne&s;s; but
I would not gratify his pa&s;&s;ion any other way than
by the mo&s;t profound e&s;teem and veneration for
his virtues, which were altogether amiable and
&s;ublime; and I would here draw his character
minutely, but it wou'd take up too much time to
&s;et forth his merits; the only man living of my
acquaintance who re&s;embles him is lord F&mdash;, of
whom I &s;hall &s;peak in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>About this time, I underwent a very inter|e&s;ting
change in the &s;ituation of my heart. I had
&s;ent a me&s;&s;age to my old lover S&mdash;, de&s;iring he
would allow my picture, which was in his po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion,
to be copied; and he now tran&s;mitted it to
me by my lawyer, whom he directed to a&s;k, if I
intended to be at the next ma&s;querade. This
curio&s;ity had a &s;trange effect upon my &s;pirits;
my heart fluttered at the que&s;tion, and my imagi|nation
glowed with a thou&s;and fond pre&s;ages. I
an&s;wered in the affirmative, and we met by acci|dent
at the ball. I could not behold him without
emotion; when he acco&s;ted me, his well-known
v$$ce made my heart vibrate, like a mu&s;ical chord,
w$$n its uni&s;on is &s;truck. All the ideas of our
p$$t love, which the lap&s;e of time and ab&s;ence
had en$eebled and $ulled a&s;leep, now awoke, and
were rein&s;p$red by his appearance; &s;o that h$s
<PB N="156" REF="161">
artful excu&s;es were ea&s;ily admitted: I forgave
him all that I had &s;uffered on his account, becau&s;e
he was the natural lord of my affection; and our
former corre&s;pondence was renewed.</P>
<P>I thought my&s;elf in a new world of bli&s;s, in
con&s;equence of this reconciliation, the raptures
of which continued unimpaired for the &s;pace of
four months, during which time he was fonder of
me, if po&s;&s;ible, than before, repeated his promi&s;e of
marriage, if we &s;hould ever have it in our power;
a&s;&s;ured me he had never been happy &s;ince he left
me; that he believed no woman had ever loved
like me: and indeed, to have a notion of my
pa&s;&s;ion for that man, you mu&s;t fir&s;t have loved as
I did: but, through a &s;trange caprice, I broke
off the corre&s;pondence, out of apprehen&s;ion that
he would for&s;ake me again. From his pa&s;t con|duct,
I dreaded what might happen; and the re|membrance
of what I had undergone by his in|con&s;tancy,
filled my imagination with &s;uch hor|ror,
that I could not endure the &s;hocking pro&s;pect,
and prematurely plunged my&s;elf into the danger,
rather than endure the terrors of expectation. In
con&s;equence of this de&s;ertion, I received a letter
from him, acknowledging that he was rightly &s;erv|ed,
but that it gave him inexpre&s;&s;ible concern.</P>
<P>Mean while, lord&mdash;continued to act in
the character of a fiend, tormenting me with
his nau&s;eous importunities: he prevailed upon
the duke of L&mdash;to employ his influence in
per&s;uading me to live with him; a&s;&s;uring his
grace, that I had actually promi&s;ed to give him
that proof of my obedience, and that I would
come home the &s;ooner for being pre&s;&s;ed to com|pliance
by a per&s;on of his rank and character.
Induced by the&s;e repre&s;entations, the duke ho|noured
<PB N="157" REF="162">
me with a vi&s;it; and in the cour&s;e of his
exhortations I under&s;tood how he had been thus
mi&s;informed: upon which I &s;ent for lord&mdash;,
and in his pre&s;ence convicted him of the fal&s;hood,
by communicating to his grace the articles of our
la&s;t agreement, which he did not think proper to
deny; and the duke being undeceived, declared
that he would not have given me the trouble of
vindicating my&s;elf, had he not been mi&s;led by
the in&s;incerity of my lord.</P>
<P>Baffled in this attempt, he engaged Mr. H&mdash;
V&mdash;, and afterwards my own father, in the &s;ame
ta&s;k; and tho' I &s;till adhered to my fir&s;t re&s;olu|tion,
per&s;i&s;ted with &s;uch ob&s;tinacy in his endea|vours
to make me unhappy, that I determined to
leave the kingdom; and accordingly, after I
had &s;pent the evening with him at Ranelagh, I
went away about two o'clock in the morning,
leaving my companion, with directions to re|&s;tore
to my lord his hou&s;e, furniture, plate, and
every thing he had given me &s;ince our la&s;t ac|commodation;
&s;o far was I, upon this occa&s;ion,
or at any other time of my life, from embezzling
any part of his fortune. My friend followed my
in&s;tructions mo&s;t punctually; and his lord&s;hip
knows, and will acknowledge, the truth of this
a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>Thus have I explained the true cau&s;e of my
fir&s;t expedition to Flanders, whither the world
was good-natured enough to &s;ay I followed Mr.
B&mdash;and the whole army, which happened to
be&s;ent abroad that &s;ummer. Before my departure
I likewi&s;e tran&s;mitted to lord B&mdash;the dre&s;&s;ing|place,
china, and a very con&s;iderable &s;ettlement,
of which he had been generous enough to make
me a pre&s;ent. This was an in&s;tance of my in|tegrity,
<PB N="158" REF="163">
which I thought due to a man who had
laid me under great obligations; and tho' I have
lived to be refu&s;ed a &s;mall &s;um both by him and
S&mdash;, I do not repent of my di&s;intere&s;ted beha|viour;
and all the revenge I harbour again&s;t the
la&s;t of the&s;e lovers, is the de&s;ire of having it in
my power to do him good.</P>
<P>I now found my&s;elf adrift in the world again,
and very richly de&s;erved the hard&s;hips of my con|dition,
for my indi&s;cretion in leaving lord B&mdash;,
and in tru&s;ting to the word of lord&mdash;, with|out
&s;ome farther &s;ecurity; but I have dearly paid
for my imprudence. The more I &s;aw into the
character of this man whom de&s;tiny hath ap|pointed
my &s;courge, the more was I determined
to avoid his fellow&s;hip and communication; for
he and I are, in point of di&s;po&s;ition, as oppo&s;ite
as any two principles in nature. In the fir&s;t place,
he is one of the mo&s;t un&s;ocial beings that ever
exi&s;ted; when I was plea&s;ed and happy he was
always out of temper, but if he could find means
to overca&s;t and cloud my mirth, tho' never &s;o
innocent, he then di&s;covered the &s;igns of un|common
&s;atisfaction and content, becau&s;e, by
this di&s;agreeable temper, he bani&s;hed all com|pany
from his hou&s;e. He is extremely weak of
under&s;tanding, tho' he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a good &s;hare of
low cunning, which has &s;o egregiou&s;ly impo&s;ed
upon &s;ome people, that they have actually be|lieved
him a good-natured ea&s;y creature, and
blamed me becau&s;e I did not manage him to bet|ter
purpo&s;e; but, upon further acquaintance,
they have always found him ob&s;tinate as a mule,
and capricious as a monkey. Not that he is ut|terly
void of all commendable qualities: he is
punctual in paying his debts, liberal when in
<PB N="159" REF="164">
good humour, and would be well bred, were he
not &s;ubject to fits of ab&s;ence, during which he is
altogether unconver&s;able; but he is proud, natu|rally
&s;u&s;picious, jealous, equally with and with|out
cau&s;e, never made a friend, and is an utter
&s;tranger to the joys of intimacy; in &s;hort, he
hangs like a damp upon &s;ociety, and may be pro|perly
called <HI>Kill-joy,</HI> an epithet which he has
ju&s;tly acquired. He honours me with con&s;tant
profe&s;&s;ions of love, but his conduct is &s;o oppo&s;ite
to my &s;entiments of that pa&s;&s;ion, as to have been
the prime &s;ource of all my misfortunes and af|fliction;
and I have often wi&s;hed my&s;elf the
object of his hate, in hopes of profiting by a
change in his behaviour.</P>
<P>Indeed, he has not been able to make me more
unhappy than, I believe, he is in his own mind;
for he is literally a &s;elf-tormentor, who never
enjoyed one gleam of &s;atisfaction, except at the
expence of another's quiet; and yet with this (I
had almo&s;t called it diabolical) quality, he ex|pects
that I &s;hould cheri&s;h him with all the ten|derne&s;s
of affection; and after he has been at
pains to incur my aver&s;ion, puni&s;hes my di&s;gu&s;t,
by contriving &s;chemes to mortify and perplex
me, which have often &s;ucceeded &s;o effectually,
as to endanger my life and con&s;titution; for I
have been fretted and frighted into &s;undry fits of
illne&s;s, and then I own I have experienced his
care and concern.</P>
<P>Over and above the oddities I have mentioned,
he is &s;o un&s;teady in his oeconomy, that he is al|ways
new modelling his affairs, and exhau&s;ting
his fortune, by laying out ten pounds, in order to
&s;ave a &s;hilling; he inquires into the character of a
&s;ervant after he has lived two years in his family,
<PB N="160" REF="165">
and is &s;o ridiculou&s;ly &s;tocked with vanity and &s;elf|conceit,
that notwith&s;tanding my a&s;&s;urance be|fore,
and the whole &s;eries of my conduct &s;ince
our marriage, which ought to have convinced
him of my di&s;like, he is &s;till per&s;uaded, that at
bottom, I mu&s;t admire and be enamoured of his
agreeable per&s;on and accompli&s;hments, and that
I would not fail to manife&s;t my love, were I not
&s;pirited up again&s;t him by his own relations.
Perhaps it might be their intere&s;t to foment the
mi&s;under&s;tanding betwixt us; but really, they
give them&s;elves no trouble about our affairs;
and, &s;o far as I know them, are a very good
&s;ort of people. On the whole, I think I may
with ju&s;tice pronounce my precious yoke-fellow a
trifling, teazing, in&s;ufferable, incon&s;i&s;tent creature.</P>
<P>With the little money which remained of what
I had received from his lord&s;hip, for hou&s;ekeep|ing,
I tran&s;ported my&s;elf to Flanders, and ar|rived
in Ghent, a few days after our troops were
quartered in that city, which was &s;o much
crowded with the&s;e new vi&s;itants, that I &s;hould
have found it impracticable to procure a lodging,
had I not been accommodated by lord R&mdash;B&mdash;,
the duke of A&mdash;'s younge&s;t brother, who very
politely gave me up his own. Here I &s;aw my
friend Mr. B&mdash;, who was overjoyed at my
arrival, though jealous of every man of his ac|quaintance;
for he loved me with all the ardour
of pa&s;&s;ion, and I regarded him with all the per|fection
of friend&s;hip, which, had he lived, in time
might have produced love; but it never did. Not|with&s;tanding
his earne&s;t &s;olicitations to the con|trary,
I &s;tayed but a week in Ghent, from whence
I proceeded to Bru&s;&s;els, and fixed my abode in
the Hotel de Flandre, among an agreeable &s;et of
<PB N="161" REF="166">
gentlemen and ladies, with whom I &s;pent my
time very chearfully. There being a &s;ort of
court in this city, it was frequented by all the
officers, who could obtain permi&s;&s;ion to go thi|ther;
and the place in general was gay and agree|able.
I was introduced to the be&s;t families, and
very happy in my acquaintance; for the ladies
were polite, good tempered, and obliging, and
treated me with the utmo&s;t ho&s;pitality and re|&s;pect.
Among others, I contracted a friend&s;hip
with Madam la comte&s;&s;e de C&mdash;, and her
two daughters, who were very amiable young la|dies;
and became intimate with the prince&s;s
C&mdash;and counte&s;s W&mdash;, lady of the bed|chamber
to the queen of Hungary, and a great
favourite of the governor Mon&s;ieur D'H&mdash;,
in who&s;e hou&s;e &s;he lived with his wife, who was
al&s;o a lady of a very engaging di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Soon after I had fixed my habitation in Bru&s;|&s;els,
the company at our Hotel was increa&s;ed by
three officers, who profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves my ad|mirers,
and came from Ghent, with a view of
&s;oliciting my love. This triumvirate con&s;i&s;ted
of the Scotch earl of&mdash;, lord R&mdash;M&mdash;, and
another young officer: the fir&s;t was a man of a
very genteel figure and amorous complexion,
danced well, and had a great deal of good hu|mour,
with a mixture of vanity and &s;elf-conceit.
The &s;econd had a good face, though a clum&s;y
per&s;on, and a very &s;weet di&s;po&s;ition, very much
adapted for the &s;entimental pa&s;&s;ion of love: and
the third (Mr. W&mdash;by name) was tall, thin,
and well-bred, with a great &s;tock of good na|ture
and vivacity. The&s;e adventurers began their
addre&s;&s;es in general acts of gallantry, that com|prehended
&s;everal of my female friends, with
<PB N="162" REF="167">
whom we u&s;ed to engage in parties of plea&s;ure,
both in the city and the <HI>environs,</HI> which are ex|tremely
agreeable; and when they thought they
had taken the preliminary &s;teps of &s;ecuring them|&s;elves
in my good opinion and e&s;teem, they
agreed to go on without farther delay, and that
lord&mdash;&s;hould make the fir&s;t attack upon my
heart.</P>
<P>He accordingly laid &s;iege to me, with &s;uch
warmth and a&s;&s;iduity, that I believe he deceived
him&s;elf, and began to think he was actually in
love; though at bottom, he felt no impul&s;e that
de&s;erved the &s;acred name. Though I di&s;cou|raged
him in the beginning, he per&s;ecuted me
with his addre&s;&s;es; he always &s;at by me at din|ner,
and imparted a thou&s;and trifles in continual
whi&s;pers, which attracted the notice of the com|pany
&s;o much, that I began to fear his behaviour
would give ri&s;e to &s;ome report to my prejudice;
and therefore avoided him with the utmo&s;t cau|tion.
Notwith&s;tanding all my care, however,
he found means one night, while my maid, who
lay in my room, went down &s;tairs, to get into
my chamber after I was abed: upon which, I
&s;tarted up, and told him, that if he &s;hould ap|proach
me, I would alarm the hou&s;e; for I never
wanted courage and re&s;olution. Perceiving my
di&s;plea&s;ure, he kneeled by the bed-&s;ide, begg'd I
would have pity on his &s;ufferings, and &s;wore I
&s;hould have <HI>carte blanche</HI> to the utmo&s;t extent of
his fortune. To the&s;e propo&s;als I made no other
reply, but that of prote&s;ting I would never &s;peak
to him again, if he did not quit my apartment
that moment; upon which, he thought proper
to withdraw; and I never afterwards gave him
an opportunity of &s;peaking to me on the &s;ame
<PB N="163" REF="168">
&s;ubject: &s;o that, in a few weeks, he &s;eparated
him&s;elf from our &s;ociety; though the ladies of
Bru&s;&s;els con&s;idered him as my lover, becau&s;e, of
all the other officers, he was their greate&s;t fa|vourite.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip being thus repul&s;ed, Mr. W&mdash;
took the field, and a&s;&s;ailed my heart in a very
different manner. He &s;aid, he knew not how
to make love, but was a man of honour, would
keep the &s;ecret, and &s;o forth. To this cavalier
addre&s;s I an&s;wered, that I was not angry, as I
otherwi&s;e &s;hould have been at his blunt declara|tion,
becau&s;e I found, by his own confe&s;&s;ion, he
did not know what was due to the &s;ex; and my
unhappy &s;ituation in &s;ome &s;hape excu&s;ed him for
a liberty, which he would not have dream'd of
taking, had not my misfortunes encouraged his
pre&s;umption. But I would deal with him in
his own way; and far from a&s;&s;uming the prude,
frankly a&s;&s;ured him, that he was not at all to my
ta&s;te, hoping he would con&s;ider my di&s;like as a
&s;ufficient rea&s;on to reject his love.</P>
<P>Lord R&mdash;began to feel the &s;ymptoms of a
genuine pa&s;&s;ion, which he carefully cheri&s;hed in
&s;ilence, being naturally diffident and ba&s;hful;
but, by the very means he u&s;ed to conceal it from
my ob&s;ervation, I plainly di&s;cerned the &s;ituation
of his heart, and was not at all di&s;plea&s;ed at the
progre&s;s I had made in his inclinations. Mean
while, he cultivated my acquaintance with great
a&s;&s;iduity and re&s;pect, attended me in all my ex|cur&s;ions,
and particularly in an expedition to
An$werp, with two other gentlemen, where, in
downright <HI>gaiet&egrave; de coeur,</HI> we &s;at for our pic|tures,
which were drawn in one piece; one of the
partie being repre&s;ented in the dre&s;s of an hu&s;&s;ar,
<PB N="164" REF="169">
and another in that of a running footman. This
incident I mention, becau&s;e the performance,
which is now in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, gave birth to a
thou&s;and groundle&s;s reports, that circulated in
England at our expence.</P>
<P>It was immediately after this jaunt, that lord
R&mdash;began to di&s;clo&s;e his pa&s;&s;ion; though he,
at the &s;ame time, &s;tarted &s;uch objections as
&s;eemed well $igh to extingui&s;h his hopes, la|menting,
that even if he &s;hould have the hap|pine&s;s
to engage my affections, his fortune was
too incon&s;iderable to &s;upport us again&s;t the efforts
of lord&mdash;, &s;hould he attempt to interrupt our
felicity; and that he him&s;elf was obliged to fol|l$w
the motions of the army. In &s;hort, he
&s;eemed to con&s;ider my felicity more than his
own, and behaved with &s;uch delicacy, as gra|dually
made an impre&s;&s;ion on my heart; &s;o
that when we parted, we agreed to renew our
corre&s;pondence in England.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e agreeable amu&s;ements,
which I enjoyed in almo&s;t all the different towns
of Flanders, I happened to be at Ghent one day,
&s;itting among a good deal of company, in one of
their Hotels, when a po&s;t-chai&s;e &s;topped at the
gate; upon which we went to the windows to
&s;atisfy our curio&s;ity, when who &s;hould &s;tep out
of the convenience, but my little in&s;ignificant
lord. I no &s;ooner announced him to the company,
than all the gentlemen a&s;ked whether they &s;hould
&s;tay and protect me, or withdraw; and when I
a&s;&s;ured them, that their protection was not ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
one and all of them retired; though lord
R&mdash;M&mdash;went no farther than the par|lour
below, being determined to &s;creen me
again&s;t all violence and compul&s;ion. I &s;ent a
<PB N="165" REF="170">
me&s;&s;age to my lord, de&s;iring him to walk up into
my apartment; but although his &s;ole errand was
to &s;ee and carry me off, he would not venture to
accept of my invitation, till he had demanded me
in form, from the governor of the place.</P>
<P>That gentleman being altogether a &s;tranger to
his per&s;on and character, referred him to the
commanding officer of the Engli&s;h troops, who
was a man of humour, and upon his lord&s;hip's
application, pretended to doubt his identity; ob|&s;erving,
that he had always heard lord&mdash;re|pre&s;ented
as a jolly corpulent man. He gave
him to under&s;tand, however, that even granting,
him to be the per&s;on, I was by no means &s;ubject
to military law, unle&s;s he could prove, that I had
ever inli&s;ted in his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Thus di&s;appointed in his endeavours, he re|turned
to the inn, and, with much per&s;ua&s;ion,
tru&s;ted him&s;elf in my dining-room, after having
&s;tationed his attendant at the door, in ca&s;e of ac|cidents.
When I a&s;ked, what had procured me
the honour of this vi&s;it; he told me, his bu&s;ine&s;s
and intention were to carry me home; and this
declaration produced a conference, in which I
argued the ca&s;e with him; and matters were ac|commodated
for the pre&s;ent, by my promi&s;ing to
be in England &s;ome time in September, on con|dition
that he would permit me to live by my|&s;elf,
as before, and immediately order the arrears
of my pin-money to be paid. He a&s;&s;ented to
every thing I propo&s;ed, returned in peace to his
own country, and the deficiencies of my allow|ance
were made good; while I returned to Bru&s;|&s;els,
where I &s;tayed until my departure for Eng|land,
which I regulated in &s;uch a manner as was
con&s;i&s;tent with my engagement.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="171">
I took lodgings in Pall-mall, and &s;ending for
my lord, convinced him of my punctuality, and
put him in mind of his promi&s;e; when, to my
utter a&s;toni&s;hment and confu&s;ion, he owned, that
his promi&s;e was no more than a decoy to bring
me over, and that I mu&s;t lay my account with
living in his hou&s;e, like a dutiful and obedient
wife. I heard him with the indignation &s;uch
treatment de&s;erved, upbraided him with his per|fidious
dealing, which I told him would have de|termined
me again&s;t cohabitation with him, had
I not been already re&s;olved: and being de&s;titute
of all re&s;ource, repaired to Bath, where I after|wards
met with Mr. D&mdash;and Mr. R&mdash;,
two gentlemen who had been my fellow-pa&s;&s;en|gers
in the yacht from Flanders, and treated me
with great friend&s;hip and politene&s;s, without ei|ther
talking or thinking of love.</P>
<P>With the&s;e gentlemen, who were as idle as
my&s;elf, I went to the jubilee at Pre&s;ton, which
was no other than a great number of people a&s;|&s;embled
in a &s;mall town extremely ill accommo|dated,
to partake of diver&s;ions that were bad
imitations of plays, concerts, and ma&s;querades.
If the world &s;hould place to the account of my
indi&s;cretion, my travelling in this manner, with
gentlemen to whom I had no particular attach|ment;
let it al&s;o be con&s;idered, as an alleviation,
that I always lived in terror of my lord, and con|&s;equently
was often obliged to &s;hift my quarters;
&s;o that my finances being extremely &s;lender, I
&s;tood the more in need of a&s;&s;i&s;tance and protec|tion.
I was, be&s;ides, young, incon&s;iderate, and
&s;o &s;imple, as to &s;uppo&s;e the figure of an ugly
man would always &s;ecure me from cen&s;ure on
his account: neither did I ever dream of any
<PB N="167" REF="172">
man's addre&s;&s;es, until he made an actual declara|tion
of his love.</P>
<P>Upon my return to Bath, I was again har|ra&s;&s;ed
by lord&mdash;, who came thither accom|panied
by my father, whom I was very glad to
&s;ee, though he importuned me to comply with
my hu&s;band's de&s;ire, and for the future keep
mea&s;ures with the world. This remon&s;trance
about living with my lord, which he con&s;tantly
repeated, was the only in&s;tance of his unkindne&s;s
which I ever felt. But all his admonitions were
not of force &s;ufficient to &s;hake my re&s;olution in
that particular; though the debate continued &s;o
late, that I told his lord&s;hip, it was high time to
retire, for I could not accommodate him with a
bed. He then gave me to under&s;tand, that he
would &s;tay where he was; upon which my fa|ther
took his leave, on pretence of looking out
for a lodging to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The little gentleman being now left <HI>t&ecirc;te a t&eacute;te</HI>
with me, began to di&s;cover &s;ome &s;igns of appre|hen&s;ion
in his looks; but mu&s;tering up all his re|&s;olution,
he went to the door, called up three of
his &s;ervants, whom he placed as centinels upon
the &s;tair, and flung him&s;elf in my elbow-chair,
where he re&s;igned him&s;elf to re&s;t. Intending to
go to bed, I thought it was but ju&s;t and decent
that I &s;hould &s;creen my&s;elf from the intru&s;ion of
his footmen, and with that view bolted the door.
Lord&mdash;hearing him&s;elf locked in, &s;tarted up
in the utmo&s;t terror and con&s;ternation, kicked
the door with his heel, and &s;creamed aloud, as if
he had been in the hands of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. My fa|ther,
who had not yet quitted the hou&s;e, hearing
the&s;e outcries, ran up &s;tairs again, and coming
through my bed-chamber, into the dining-room
<PB N="168" REF="173">
where we were, found me almo&s;t &s;uffocated with
laughter, and his heroic &s;on-in-law &s;taring like
one who had lo&s;t his wits, with his hair &s;tanding
on end.</P>
<P>When my father a&s;ked the meaning of his
exclamations, he told him with all the &s;ymptoms
of di&s;may, that I had lock'd him in, and he did
not under&s;tand &s;uch u&s;age: but I explained the
whole my&s;tery, by &s;aying, I had bolted the door,
becau&s;e I did not like the company of his &s;er|vants,
and could not imagine the cau&s;e of his
$word$, unle&s;s he thought I de&s;igned to ravi&s;h
him; an in&s;ult, than which nothing was farther
from my intention. My father him&s;elf could
&s;carce refrain from laughing at his ridiculous fear;
but &s;eeing him in great confu&s;ion, took pity on
his condition, and carried him off to his own
lodgings, after I had given my word, that I
would not attempt to e&s;cape, but give him au|dience
next morning. I accordingly kept my
promi&s;e, and found means to per&s;uade them to
leave me at my own di&s;cretion. Next day, I
was ra$$$ed upon the &s;tratagem I had contrived to
frighten lord&mdash;; and a thou&s;and idle &s;tories
were told about this adventure, which happened
literally as I have related it.</P>
<P>From Bath I betook my&s;elf to a &s;mall hou&s;e
near Lincoln, which I hired of the d&mdash;of
A&mdash;, becau&s;e a country life &s;uited be&s;t with
my income, which was no more than four hun|dred
pounds a year, and that not well paid.
I continued &s;ome months in this retirement, and
&s;a$ no company, except lord R&mdash;M&mdash;,
who lived in the neighbourhood, and vi&s;ited me
twice; till finding my&s;elf indi&s;po&s;ed, I was ob|l$ged
to remove to London, and took lodgings
<PB N="169" REF="174">
in Maddox-&s;treet, where my gari&s;on was taken
by &s;torm, by my lord and his &s;teward, rein|forced
by Mr. L&mdash;V&mdash;, (who, as my lord
told me, had a &s;ub&s;idy of five and twenty pounds,
before he would take the field) and a couple of
hardy footmen. This formidable band ru&s;hed
into my apartment, laid violent hands upon me,
dragged me down &s;tairs, without gloves or a
cloak, and thru&s;ting me into a coach that &s;tood
at the door, conveyed me to my lord's lodgings
in Glouce&s;ter-&s;treet.</P>
<P>Upon this occa&s;ion, his lord&s;hip courageou&s;ly
drew his &s;word upon my woman, who attempted
to defend me from his in&s;ults, and, in all proba|bility,
would have intimidated him from pro|ceeding;
for he looked pale and agha&s;t, his knees
knocked together, and he breathed thick and
hard, with his no&s;trils dilated, as if he had &s;een
a gho&s;t. But he was encouraged by his merce|nary
a&s;&s;ociate, who, for the five and twenty
pounds, &s;tood by him in the day of trouble, and
&s;pirited him on to this gallant enterprize.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this exploit, I was cooped
up in a paultry apartment in Glouce&s;ter-&s;treet,
where I was clo&s;e be&s;et by his lord&s;hip, and his
worthy &s;teward Mr. H&mdash;, with a &s;et of &s;er|vants
that were the creatures of this fellow, of
whom lord&mdash;him&s;elf &s;tood in awe; &s;o that
I could not help thinking my&s;elf in Newgate,
among thieves and ruffians: and to &s;uch a degree
did my terror prevail, that I actually believed I
was in danger of being poi&s;oned, and would not
receive any &s;u&s;tenance, except from the hands of
one harmle&s;s-looking fellow, a foreigner, who
was my lord's valet de chambre. I will not pre|tend
to &s;ay my fears were ju&s;t; but &s;uch was my
<PB N="170" REF="175">
opinion of H&mdash;n, that I never doubted he would
put me out of the way, if he thought my life in|terfered
with his intere&s;t.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd day of my impri&s;onment, I was
vi&s;ited by the duke of L&mdash;, a friend of my
lord, who found me &s;itting upon a trunk, in a poor
little dining-room filled with lumber, and lighted
with two bits of tallow-candle, which had been
left over night. He perceived in my counte|nance
a mixture of rage, indignation, terror and
de&s;pair: he compa&s;&s;ionated my &s;ufferings, though
he could not alleviate my di&s;tre&s;s, any other way
than by interceding with my tyrant to mitigate my
oppre&s;&s;ion. Neverthele&s;s, I remained eleven days
in this comfortable &s;ituation: I was watched like
a criminal all day, and one of the &s;ervants
walked from one room to another all night, in
the nature of a patrole; while my lord, who lay
in the chamber above me, got out of bed, and
tripp'd to the window, at the &s;ound of every
coach that chanced to pa&s;s through the &s;treet.
H&mdash;n, who was con&s;ummate in the arts of a
$$cophant, began to court my favour, by con|doling
my affliction, and a&s;&s;uring me, that the
only method by which I could regain my liberty,
was a chearful compliance with the humour of
my lord. I was fully convinced of the truth of
this ob&s;ervation; and though my temper is alto|gether
aver&s;e to di&s;&s;imulation, attempted to affect
an air of &s;erenity and re&s;ignation. But this di&s;|gui&s;e,
I $word$, would not an&s;wer my purpo&s;e; and
therefore I had recour&s;e to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of my
maid, who was permitted to attend me in my
confinement. With her I frequently con&s;ulted
about the means of accompli&s;hing my e&s;cape;
and, in con&s;equence of our deliberations, &s;he di|rected
<PB N="171" REF="176">
a coach and fix to be ready at a certain
part of the town, and to wait for me three days
in the &s;ame place, in ca&s;e I could not come before
the expiration of that term.</P>
<P>This previous mea&s;ure being taken according
to my in&s;tructions, the next nece&s;&s;ary &s;tep was to
elude the vigilance of my guard: and in this
manner did I effectuate my purpo&s;e. Being, by
this time, indulged in the liberty of going out
in the coach, for the benefit of the air, attended
by two footmen, who had orders to watch all my
motions, I made u&s;e of this privilege one fore|noon,
when lord&mdash;expected &s;ome company
to dinner, and bad the coachman drive to the
lodgings of a man who wrote with his mouth,
intending to give my &s;pies the &s;lip, on pretence
of &s;eeing this curio&s;ity: but they were too alert
in their duty to be thus outwitted, and followed
me up &s;tairs into the very apartment.</P>
<P>Di&s;appointed in this hope, I revolved another
&s;cheme, which was attended with &s;ucce&s;s: I
bought &s;ome olives at an oil-&s;hop; and telling the
&s;ervants I would proceed to St. James's gate, and
take a turn in the park, broke one of the bottles
by the way, complained of the misfortune when
I was &s;et down, and de&s;ired that my coach might
be cleaned before my return. While my atten|dants
were employed in this office, I tripp'd
acro&s;s the parade to the hor&s;e-guards, and chanced
to meet with an acquaintance in the park, who
&s;aid, he &s;aw by my countenance, that I was up|on
&s;ome expedition. I owned his &s;uppo&s;ition was
ju&s;t; but, as I had not time to relate particulars,
I quickened my pace, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a
hackney-coach, in which I proceeded to the ve|hicle
which I had appointed to be in waiting.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="177">
While I thus compa&s;&s;ed my e&s;cape, there was
nothing but perplexity and confu&s;ion at home;
dinner was delayed till &s;ix o'clock; my lord ran
half over the town in que&s;t of his equipage,
which at la&s;t returned, with an account of my
elopement. My maid was brought to the que|&s;tion,
and grievou&s;ly threatened; but (like all
the women I ever had) remained un&s;haken in her
fidelity. In the mean time, I travelled night and
day towards my retreat in Lincoln&s;hire, of which
his lord&s;hip had not, as yet, got the lea&s;t intelli|gence;
and as my coachman was but an unex|perienced
driver, I was obliged to make u&s;e of
my own &s;kill in that exerci&s;e, and direct his en|deavours
the whole way, without venturing to
go to bed, or take the lea&s;t repo&s;e, until I reached
my own habitation, where I lived in peace and
tranquillity for the &s;pace of &s;ix weeks, when I
was alarmed by one of my lord's myrmidons,
who came into the neighbourhood, blu&s;tering
and &s;wcaing, that he would carry me off, e$|t$er
dead or alive.</P>
<P>It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that I was perfectly
ea&s;y, when I was made acquainted with his pur|po&s;e
and declaration, as my whole family $word$
of no more th$n a couple of women and one
footman. $word$ &s;ummoned up my cou|$$$e,
which had been often tried, and never f$r|$ook
me in the day of danger; and &s;ent him
word, th$t if $$er he &s;hould pre&s;ume to approach
my hou&s;$, I would order $word$ to be &s;hot, without
cer$mony. The fellow did not choo&s;e to put me
to the $word$, and returned to town without his
$word$. But as th$ place of my above was new
di&s;covered, I $word$ my account w$th having a vi$t
from his employer: I therefore planted &s;pies upo$
<PB N="173" REF="178">
$word$ road, with a promi&s;e of reward to him who
&s;hould bring me the fir&s;t intelligence of his
$$d&s;hip's approach.</P>
<P>Accordingly, I was one morning apprized of
$word$ coming; and mounting hor&s;e immediately,
with my woman and valet, away we rode, in
defiance of winter, and in two days got through
the wilds of Lincoln&s;hire and hundreds of E&s;&s;ex,
cro&s;&s;ed the river at Tilbury, breakfa&s;ted at Chat|ham,
by the help of a guide and moon-light, ar|$$ved
at Dover the &s;ame evening, and embarked
$word$ C$l$is, in which place I found my&s;elf next day
$word$ two o'clock in the afternoon; and being hear|$ly
tired with my journey, betook my&s;elf to
$word$. My maid, who was not able to travel with
&s;uch expedition, followed me at an ea&s;ier pace;
and the footman was &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed at my per&s;e|verance,
that he could not help a&s;king upon the
road, if ever I was weary in my life. Certain it
is, my &s;pirits and re&s;olution have enabled me to
undergo fatigues that are almo&s;t incredible. From
Calais I went to Bru&s;&s;els, where I again &s;et up
my $e&s;t in private lodgings; was again per|fectly
well received by the fa&s;hionable people of
that place; and, by the intere&s;t of my friends,
obtained the queen of Hungary's protection again&s;t
the per&s;ecution of my hu&s;band, while I &s;hould re|&s;ide
in the Au&s;trian Netherlands.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ecured, I lived uncen&s;ured, conver&s;ing
$word$ the Engli&s;h company, with which this city
$word$, but &s;pent the mo&s;t agreeable part
$word$ my time with the counte&s;s of Calemberg, in
who&s;e hou&s;e I generally dined and &s;upped; and I
al&s;o contracted an intimacy with the prince&s;s of
Chemay, who was a great favourite with Madam
D'H$arach, the governor's lady.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="179">
I had not been long in this happy &s;ituation,
when I was di&s;turbed by the arrival of lord&mdash;,
who demanded me of the governor; but finding
me &s;heltered from his power, he &s;et out for Vi|enna;
and, in con&s;equence of his repre&s;entations,
&s;trengthened with the duke of N&mdash;'s name, my
protection was withdrawn. But, before this ap|plication,
he had gone to the camp, and addre&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf to my lord Stair, who was my parti|cular
friend, and ally by my fir&s;t marriage, de|&s;iring
he would compel me to return to his hou&s;e,
His lord&s;hip told him, that I was in no &s;hape &s;ub|ject
to his command; but invited him to dinner,
with a view of diverting him&s;elf and company, at
the expence of his gue&s;t. In the evening, he
was plied with &s;o many bumpers to my health,
that he became intoxicated, and extremely ob|&s;treperous,
in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;eeing lord Stair, after
he was retired to re&s;t, and quarrelled with lord
D&mdash;, who being a tall, large, raw-boned
Scotchman, could have &s;wallowed him at one
mouthful; but he thought he might venture to
challenge him, in hopes of being put under ar|re&s;t
by the general: though he reckoned without
his ho&s;t; lord Stair knew his di&s;po|&s;ition, and,
in order to puni&s;h his pre&s;umption, winked at the
affair. The challenger, finding him&s;elf mi&s;taken
in his conjecture, got up early in the morning,
and went off po&s;t for Vienna: and lord Stair de|&s;ired
a certain man of quality to make me a vi&s;it,
and give me an account of his behaviour.</P>
<P>Being now deprived of my protection and p$n|money,
which my generous hu&s;band would no long|er
pay, I was reduced to great difficulty and di&s;tre&s;s.
The duche&s;s D'Aremberg, lord G&mdash;, and many
other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, interceded in my be|half
<PB N="175" REF="180">
with his maje&s;ty, who was then abroad;
but he refu&s;ed to interpo&s;e between man and
wife. The counte&s;s of Calemberg wrote a letter to
my father, in which &s;he repre&s;ented my uncom|fortable
&s;ituation, and undertook to an&s;wer for
my conduct, in ca&s;e he would allow me a &s;mall
annuity, on which I could live independant of
lord&mdash;, who, by all accounts, was a wretch
with whom I could never enjoy the lea&s;t happi|ne&s;s
or quiet; otherwi&s;e, &s;he would be the fir&s;t to
advi&s;e me to an accommodation. She gave him
to under&s;tand, that her character was neither
doubtful nor ob&s;cure; and that if my conduct
there had not been irreproachable, &s;he &s;hould not
have taken me under her protection: that as I
propo&s;ed to board in a convent, a &s;mall &s;um
would an&s;wer my occa&s;ions; but, if that &s;hould
be denied, I would actually go to &s;ervice, or take
&s;ome other de&s;perate &s;tep, to avoid the man who
was my bane and aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>To this kind remon&s;trance my father an&s;wer|ed,
that his fortune would not allow him to a&s;&s;i&s;t
me; he had now a young family; and that I
ought, at all events, to return to my hu&s;band.
By this time, &s;uch was the extremity of my cir|cum&s;tances,
that I was forced to pawn my
cloaths, and every trifling trinket in my po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion,
and even to de&s;cend &s;o far as to &s;ollicit Mr.
S&mdash;for a loan of fifty pounds, which he refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>Thus was I de&s;erted, in my di&s;tre&s;s, by two
per&s;ons, to whom, in the &s;ea&s;on of my affluence,
my pur&s;e had been always open. Nothing &s;o
effectually &s;ubdues a &s;pirit unu&s;ed to &s;upplicate, as
want: repul&s;ed in this manner, I had recour&s;e to
lord B&mdash;, who was al&s;o (it &s;eems) unable to relieve
<PB N="176" REF="181">
my nece&s;&s;ities. This mortification I de&s;erved at
his hands, tho' he had once put it in my power
to be above all &s;uch paultry demands; and I
&s;hould not have been compelled to the di&s;agree|able
ta&s;k of troubling my friends, had not I vo|luntarily
re&s;igned what he formerly gave me.
As to the other gentleman to whom I addre&s;&s;ed
my&s;elf, on this occa&s;ion, I think he might have
&s;hewn more regard to my application, not only
for the rea&s;ons already mentioned, but because
he knew me too well to be ignorant of what I
mu&s;t have &s;uffered, in conde&s;cending to make
&s;uch a reque&s;t.</P>
<P>Several officers, who gue&s;s'd my adver&s;ity,
generou&s;ly offered to &s;upply me with money; but
I could not bring my&s;elf to make u&s;e of their
friend&s;hip, or even to own my di&s;tre&s;s, except
to one per&s;on, of whom I borrowed a &s;mall &s;$m.
To crown my misfortunes, I was taken very
ill, at a time when there was no other way of
avoiding the clutches of my per&s;ecutor, but by a
precipitate flight. In this emergency, I appl$$$
to a worthy gentleman of Bru&s;&s;els, a very $word$
friend of mine, but no lover. I &s;ay no $word$
becau&s;e every man is &s;uppo&s;ed to act in that c$$$|city
who befriends a young woman in $word$
This generous Fleming &s;et out with me, in the
night, from Bru&s;&s;els, and conducted me to the
frontiers of France. Being very much indi&s;po&s;ed
both in mind and body when I was obliged to
undertake this expedition, I &s;hould, in all proba|bility,
have &s;unk under the fitigue of travelling,
had not my &s;pirits been kept up by the conversa|tion
of my companion, who was a man of $word$
and con&s;equence, and undertook to manage
<PB N="177" REF="182">
my affairs in &s;uch a manner as would enable me
to re e&s;tabli&s;h my re&s;idence in the place I had
left. He was young and active, attended me
with the utmo&s;t care and a&s;&s;iduity, and left no|thing
undone which he thought would contribute
to my ea&s;e and &s;atisfaction. I believe his friend|&s;hip
for me was a little tinctured with another
pa&s;&s;ion; but he was married, and lived very well
with his wife, who was al&s;o my friend; &s;o that
he k$ew I would never think of him in the light
of a lover.</P>
<P>Upon our arrival at Valenciennes, he accom|modated
me with a little money (for a little was
all I would take) and returned to his own city,
after we had &s;ettled a corre&s;pondence by letters.
I was detained a day or two in this place by my
$nd &s;po&s;ition, which increa&s;ed; but neverthele&s;s
proceeded to Paris, to make intere&s;t for a pro|tection
from the king of France, which that
monarch graciou&s;ly accorded me, in three days
after my fir&s;t application; and his mini&s;ter &s;ent
orders to all the governors and intendants of the
province towns, to protect me again&s;t the efforts
of lord&mdash;, in whatever place I &s;hould choo&s;e
to re&s;ide.</P>
<P>Having returned my thanks at Ver&s;ailles for
this favour, and tarried a few days at Paris,
which was a place altogether un&s;uitable to the
low ebb of my fortune, I repaired to Li&s;le, where
I intended to fix my habitation; and there my
di&s;order recurred with &s;uch violence, that I was
obl$ged to &s;end for a phy&s;ician, who &s;eemed to
$word$ been a di&s;ciple of Sangrado; for he &s;carce
$word$ drop of blood in my body, and yet I found
$span$. Indeed I was &s;o
$word$ exhau&s;ted by the&s;e $word$, and my
<PB N="178" REF="183">
con&s;titution &s;o much impaired by fatigue and per|turbation
of mind, that I had no other hope of
recovering but that of reaching England, and
putting my&s;elf under the direction of a phy&s;ician
on who&s;e ability I could depend.</P>
<P>With this doubtful pro&s;pect, therefore, I de|termined
to attempt a return to my native air,
and actually departed from Li&s;le, in &s;uch a me|lancholy
enfeebled condition, that I had almo&s;t
fainted when I was put into the coach. But be|fore
I re&s;olved upon this journey I was reduced
to the utmo&s;t exigence of fortune; &s;o that I
could &s;carce afford to buy provi&s;ions, had it been
in my power to eat, and &s;hould not have been
able to defray my travelling expences, had I not
been generou&s;ly befriended by lord R&mdash;M&mdash;
who (I am &s;ure) would have done any thing for
my ea&s;e and accommodation, tho' he has un|ju&s;tly
incurred the imputation of being par&s;imo|nious,
and I had no rea&s;on to expect any &s;uch
favour at his hands.</P>
<P>In this deplorable &s;tate of health I was convey|ed
to Calais, being all the way (as it were) in
the arms of death, without having &s;wallowed the
lea&s;t &s;u&s;tenance on the road; and &s;o much was
my indi&s;po&s;ition augmented by the fatigue of the
journey, that I &s;wooned when I was brought in|to
the inn, and had almo&s;t expired before I could
receive the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance or advice: however,
my &s;pirits were a little revived by &s;ome bread and
wine, which I took at the per&s;ua&s;ion of a French
&s;urgeon, who chancing to pa&s;s by the door, was
called up to my relief; and having &s;ent my &s;er|vant
to Bru&s;&s;els to take care of my cloaths, em|barked
in the packet-boat, and by that time we
arrived at Dover, was almo&s;t in extremity.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="184">
Here I found a return coach, in which I was
carried to London, and was put to bed in the hou&s;e
at which we put up, more dead than alive. The
people of the inn &s;ent for an apothecary, who ad|mini&s;tred
&s;ome cordial that recalled me to life;
and when I recovered the u&s;e of &s;peech, I told
I am who I was, and de&s;ired him to wait upon
Dr. S&mdash;and inform him of my &s;ituation. A
young girl who was niece to the landlord's wife,
&s;eeing $$e unattended, made a tender of her &s;er|vice
to me, and I accepted the offer, as well as
a lodging in the apothecary's hou&s;e, to which
I was conveyed as &s;oon as my &s;trength would ad|$$t
of my removal; and there was vi&s;ited by my
$$$$cian, who was &s;hocked to find me in &s;uch a
$word$ condition: however, having con&s;idered
$word$, he perceived that my indi&s;po&s;ition $word$
from the calamities I had undergone,
$word$ encouraged me with the hope of a &s;peedy
$word$, provided I could be kept ea&s;y and undi&s;|$word$.</P>
<P>I was accordingly tended with all imaginable
$word$ my lord's name being never mentioned in
$word$ $earing, becau&s;e I con&s;idered him as the fatal
$$nce of all my misfortunes; and in a month I
$word$ my health, by the great &s;kill and ten|$$$$$
of my doctor, who now finding me
$word$ enough to encounter fre&s;h troubles, en|$word$
to per&s;uade me, that it would be my
$word$ &s;$$p to return to my husband, whom, at
$span$ he had often occa&s;ion to &s;ee. But I
$span$, commenced a new $span$
and took a &s;mall hou&s;e in St.
$word$ Square.</P>
<P>$word$ at this time, my woman retumed from
$word$, but without my cl$at$s, which were
<PB N="180" REF="185">
detained on account of the money I owed in that
place; and a&s;king her di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from m$ &s;ervice,
&s;et up &s;hop for her&s;elf. I had not lived many
weeks in my new habitation, when my per&s;ecutor
renewed his attempts to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of
my per&s;on; but I had learn'd from experience,
to redouble my vigilance, and he was fru&s;trated
in all his endeavours. I was again happy in the
conver&s;ation of my former acquaintance, and vi|&s;ited
by a great number of gentlemen, mo&s;t|ly
per&s;ons of probity and &s;en&s;e, who culti|vated
my friend&s;hip, without any other motive
of attachment. Not that I was un&s;olicited on
the article of love; that was a theme on which I
never wanted orators; and could I have pre|vailed
upon my&s;elf to profit by the advances that
were made, I might have managed my opportu|nities,
&s;o as to have &s;et fortune at defiance for the
future. But I was none of tho&s;e oeconomi&s;ts,
who can &s;acrifice their hearts to intere&s;ted con|&s;iderations.</P>
<P>One evening, while I was conver&s;ing with
three or four of my friends, my lawyer came in,
and told me he had &s;omething of con&s;equence to
impart: upon which, all the gentlemen but one
went away; and he gave me to under&s;tand, that
my &s;uit would immediately come to trial; and
though he hoped the be&s;t, the i&s;&s;ue was uncer|tain:
that if it &s;hould be given again&s;t me, the
deci&s;ion would in&s;pire my lord with fre&s;h &s;pirits
to di&s;turb my peace; and therefore it would be
convenient for me to retire, until the affair &s;hould
be brought to a determination.</P>
<P>I was very much di&s;concerted at this inte$$$|gence;
and the gentleman who &s;tayed percei$$$,
my concern, a&s;$ed what I intended to &s;o, $word$
<PB N="181" REF="186">
he could &s;erve me in any &s;hape, and de&s;ired to
know whither I propo&s;ed to retreat. I affected
to laugh, and an&s;wered, &startq;To a garret I be|lieve.&endq;
To this over-&s;trained raillery he replied,
that if I &s;hould, his friend&s;hip and regard would
find the way to my apartment; and I had no
rea&s;on to doubt the &s;incerity of his declaration.
We con&s;ulted about the mea&s;ures I &s;hould take,
and I determined to remove into the country,
where I was &s;oon favoured with a letter from
him, wherein he expre&s;&s;ed the infinite plea&s;ure
he had, in being able to a&s;&s;ure me, that my &s;uit
had been &s;ucce&s;sful, and that I might appear again
with great &s;afety.</P>
<P>Accordingly, I returned to town in his coach
and &s;ix, which he had &s;ent for my convenience,
and the &s;ame evening went with him to the ma&s;que|ra$e,
where we pa&s;&s;ed the night very agreeably,
his &s;pirits, as well as mine, being elevated to a
joyous pitch, by the happy event of my proce&s;s.
This gentleman was a per&s;on of great honour,
wroth and good nature; he loved me extremely,
but did not care that I &s;hould know the extent of
his pa&s;&s;ion: on the contrary, he endeavoured to
per&s;uade me, he had laid it down as a maxim,
that no woman &s;hould ever have power enough
over his heart, to give him the lea&s;t pain or di&s;|quiet.
In &s;hort, he had made a progre&s;s in my
affection, and to his genero&s;ity was I indebted
for my &s;ub&s;i&s;tence two whole years; during
which, he was continually profe&s;&s;ing this philo|&s;ophic
indifference, while, at the &s;ame time, he
was giving me daily a&s;&s;urances of his friend&s;hip
and e&s;teem, and treating me with ince&s;&s;ant marks
of the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate love: &s;o that I concluded
<PB N="182" REF="187">
his intention was cold, though his temper was
warm; and con&s;idering my&s;elf as an incumbrance
upon his fortune, I redoubled my endeavours to
obtain a &s;eparate maintenance from my lord, and
removed from St. James's Square to lodgings at
Ken&s;ington, where I had not long enjoyed my|&s;elf
in tranquillity, before it was interrupted by
a very unexpected vi&s;it.</P>
<P>While I was bu&s;y one day dre&s;&s;ing in my
dining-room, I found his lord&s;hip at my elbow,
before I was aware of his approach, although his
coach was at the door, and the hou&s;e already in
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his &s;ervants. He acco&s;ted me
in the u&s;ual &s;tile, as if we had parted the night
before; and I an&s;wered him with an appearance
of the &s;ame carele&s;s familiarity, de&s;iring him to
&s;it down, while I retreated to my chamber,
lock'd the door, and fairly went to bed; being,
perhaps, the fir&s;t woman who went thither for
protection from the in&s;ults of a man. Here then
I immured my&s;elf with my faithful Ahigail; and
my lord finding me &s;ecured, knocked at the door,
and through the key-hole begg'd to be admitted;
a&s;&s;uring me, that all he wanted was a conference.
I de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed, though I believed his a&s;|&s;urance;
but I had no inclination to conver&s;e
with him, becau&s;e I knew from experience the
nature of his conver&s;ation, which was &s;o di&s;agree|able
and tormenting, that I wou'd have exchanged
it at any time for a good beating, and thought
my&s;elf a gainer by the bargain. However, he
per&s;i&s;ted in his importunities to &s;uch a degree,
that I a&s;&s;ented to his propo&s;al, on condition that
the duke of L&mdash;&s;hould be pre&s;ent at the in|terview;
and he immediately &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to
his grace, while I in peace ate my breakfa&s;t,
<PB N="183" REF="188">
conveyed in a ba&s;ket, which was hoi&s;ted up to
the window of my bed-chamber.</P>
<P>The duke was &s;o kind as to come at my lord's
reque&s;t, and before I would open the door, gave
me his word, that I &s;hould be protected from all
violence and compul&s;ion. Thus a&s;&s;ured, they
were permitted to enter; and my little gentle|man
&s;itting down by the bed-&s;ide, began to re|peat
the old hackneyed arguments he had for|merly
u&s;ed, with the view of inducing me to
live with him; and I, on my &s;ide, repeated my
former objections, or pretended to li&s;ten to his
repre&s;entations, while my imagination was em|ployed
in contriving the means of effecting an
e&s;cape, as the duke ea&s;ily perceived by my coun|tenance.</P>
<P>Finding all his remon&s;trances ineffectual, he
quitted the chamber, and left his cau&s;e to the
eloquence of his grace, who &s;at with me a whole
half hour, without exerting him&s;elf much in be|half
of his client, becau&s;e he knew I was alto|gether
ob&s;tinate, and determined on that &s;core;
but joked upon the behaviour of his lord|&s;hip,
who (though jealous of mo&s;t people) had
left him alone with me in my bed-chamber, ob|&s;erving,
that he mu&s;t either have great confi|dence
in his virtue, or a very bad opinion of him
afterwi&s;e. In &s;hort, I found means to defer the
catgorical an&s;wer till next day, and invited the
duke and his lord&s;hip to dine with me to-morrow.
My wife yoke-fellow &s;eemed to doubt the &s;in|cerity
of this invitation, and was very much di&s;|po&s;ed
to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my fort: but, by the
p$$$a&s;ions of his grace, and the advice of H&mdash;n,
who was his chief coun&s;ellor and back, he was
<PB N="184" REF="189">
prevailed upon to take my word, and for the pre|&s;ent
left me.</P>
<P>They were no &s;ooner retired, than I ro&s;e with
great expedition, pack'd up my cloaths, and took
&s;helter in E&s;&s;ex for the fir&s;t time. Next day,
my lord and his noble friend came to dinner, ac|cording
to appointment; and being informed of
my e&s;cape by my woman, whom I had left in the
hou&s;e, his lord&s;hip di&s;covered &s;ome &s;igns of di&s;|content,
and in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;eeing my papers;
upon which, my maid produced a parcel of bills
which I owed to different people. Notwith|&s;tanding
this di&s;appointment, he &s;at down to
what was provided for dinner, and with great de|liberation
ate up a leg of lamb, the be&s;t part of
a fowl, and &s;omething el&s;e, which I do not now
remember; and then very peaceably went away,
giving my maid an opportunity of following me
to the place of my retreat.</P>
<P>My intention was to have &s;ought refuge, as
formerly, in another country; but I was pre|vented
from putting my de&s;ign in execution by a
fit of illne&s;s, during which I was vi&s;ited by my
phy&s;ician and &s;ome of my own relations, parti|cularly
a di&s;tant cou&s;in of mine, whom my lord had
engaged in his intere&s;ts, by promi&s;ing to recom|pence
her amply, if &s;he could per&s;uade me to
comply with his de&s;ire. In this office &s;he was a&s;|&s;i&s;ted
by the doctor, who was my friend, and a
man of &s;en&s;e, for whom I have the mo&s;t perfect
e&s;teem, though he and I have often differed in
point of opinion. In a word, I was expo&s;ed to
the ince&s;&s;ant importunities of all my acquaintance,
which, added to the de&s;perate circum&s;tances of
my fortune, compelled me to embrace the terms
<PB N="185" REF="190">
that were offered, and I again returned to the
dome&s;tic duties of a wife.</P>
<P>I was conducted to my lord's hou&s;e by an old
friend of mine, a gentleman turned of fifty, of
admirable parts and under&s;tanding; he was a
plea&s;ing companion, chearful and humane, and
had acquired a great &s;hare of my e&s;teem and re|&s;pect.
In a word, his advice had great weight in
my deliberations, becau&s;e it &s;eemed to be the re|&s;ult
of experience and di&s;intere&s;ted friend&s;hip.
Without all doubt, he had an unfeigned concern
for my welfare; but, being an admirable poli|tician,
his &s;cheme was to make my intere&s;t coin|cide
with his own inclinations; for I had un|wittingly
made an innovation upon his heart;
and as he thought I &s;hould hardly favour his
pa&s;&s;ion, while I was at liberty to conver&s;e with
the re&s;t of my admirers, he coun&s;elled me to
&s;arrender that freedom, well knowing that my
lord would be ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to bani&s;h all his ri|va's
from the hou&s;e; in which ca&s;e, he did not
doubt of his being able to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into
my affections; becau&s;e he laid it down as an
eternal truth, that if any two per&s;ons of different
&s;exes were obliged to live together in a de&s;art,
where they would be excluded from all other
human intercour&s;e, they would naturally and in|evitably
contract an inclination for each other.</P>
<P>How ju&s;t this hypothe&s;is may be, I leave to
the determination of the curious; though, if I
may be allowed to judge from my own di&s;po&s;i|tion,
a couple &s;o &s;ituated would be apt to im|bibe
mutual di&s;gu&s;ts, from the nature and ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of their union; unle&s;s their a&s;&s;ociation
was at fir&s;t the effect of reciprocal affection and
e&s;teem. Be this as it will, I honour the gentle|man
<PB N="186" REF="191">
man for his plan, which was ingeniou&s;ly con|trived,
and artfully conducted: but I happened
to have too much addre&s;s for him in the &s;equel,
cunning as he was, though at fir&s;t I did not per|ceive
his drift; and his lord&s;hip was much le&s;s
likely to comprehend his meaning.</P>
<P>Immediately after this new accommodation, I
was carried to a country-hou&s;e belonging to my
lord, and was &s;imple enough to venture my&s;elf
(unattended by any &s;ervant on who&s;e integrity I
could depend) in the hands of his lord&s;hip and
H&mdash;n, who&s;e villainy I always dreaded; th$
at this time my apprehen&s;ions were con&s;i|derably
increa&s;ed, by recollecting, that it was
not his intere&s;t to let me live in the hou&s;e, le$t
his conduct &s;hould be inquired into; and by re|membering,
that the very hou&s;e to which we
were going, had been twice burnt down in a
very &s;hort &s;pace of time, not without &s;u&s;picion
of his having been the incendiary, on account of
&s;ome box of writings, which was lo&s;t in the con|flagration.
True it is, this imputation was never
made good; and perhaps he was altogether inno|cent
of the charge, which neverthele&s;s affected
my &s;pirits in &s;uch a manner, as rendered me the
mo&s;t mi&s;erable of all mortals; and in this terror
did I remain, till my con&s;ternation was weakened
by the arrival of Mr. Bal&mdash;, a good natured
worthy man, whom my lord had invited to his
hou&s;e, and I thought would not &s;ee me ill u&s;ed;
and in a few weeks, we were joined by Dr. S&mdash;
and his lady, who vi&s;ited us according to their
promi&s;e; and it was re&s;olved that we &s;hould &s;et
out for Tunbridge, on a partie of plea&s;ure, and
at our return examine H&mdash;n's accounts.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="192">
This la&s;t part of our &s;cheme was not all re|li&s;hed
by our worthy &s;teward, who, therefore,
determined to overturn our whole plan, and &s;uc|ceeded
accordingly. My lord, all of a &s;udden,
declared him&s;elf again&s;t the jaunt we had pro|jected,
and in&s;i&s;ted upon my &s;taying at home,
without a&s;&s;igning any rea&s;on for this peremptory
behaviour; his countenance became cloudy, and
for the &s;pace of three days he did not open his
mouth.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, he one night entered my bed-cham|bet,
to which he now had free acce&s;s, with his
&s;word under his arm, and, if I remember aright,
it was ready drawn. I could not help taking no|tice
of this alarming circum&s;tance, which &s;hocked
me the more, as it happened immediately after a
gloomy fit of di&s;content. However, I &s;eemed
to overlook the incident, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ing my maid,
went to bed; becau&s;e I was a&s;hamed to ac|knowledge,
even to my own heart, any dread of
a per&s;on whom I de&s;pi&s;ed &s;o much. However,
the &s;trength of my con&s;titution was not equal to
the fortitude of my mind: I was taken ill, and
the &s;ervants were obliged to be called up; while
my lord him&s;elf, terrified at my &s;ituation, ran up
&s;tai$s to Mrs. S&mdash;, who was in bed, told her,
with evident perturbation of &s;pirits, that I was
very much indi&s;po&s;ed, and &s;aid, he believed I
was frightened by his entering my chamber with
his &s;word in hand.</P>
<P>This lady was &s;o &s;tartled at his information,
that &s;he ran into my apartment half-naked, and
as &s;he went down &s;tairs, a&s;ked what rea&s;on could
induce him to have carried his &s;word with him?
Upon which he gave her to under&s;tand, that his
intention was to kill the bats. I believe and
<PB N="188" REF="193">
hope he had no other de&s;ign than that of intimi|dating
me, but when the $word$ happened, I was
of a different opinion. Mrs. S&mdash;having put on
her cloaths, &s;at up all night by my bed-&s;ide, and
was &s;o good as to a&s;&s;ure me, that &s;he would not
leave me, until I &s;hould be &s;afely delivered from
the apprehen&s;ions that &s;urrounded me in this
hou&s;e, to which &s;he and the doctor had been the
principal cau&s;e of my coming; for my lord had
haunted and importuned them ince&s;&s;antly on this
&s;ubject, prote&s;ting that he loved me with the
mo&s;t inviolable affection; and all he de&s;ired was,
that I would &s;it at his table, manage his family,
and &s;hare his fortune. By the&s;e profe&s;&s;ion, ut|tered
with an air of hone&s;ty and good-nature, he
had impo&s;ed him&s;elf upon them, for the be&s;t
tempered creature upon earth; and they u&s;ed
all their influence with me to take him into fa|vour.
This hath been the ca&s;e with a great
many people, who had but a &s;uperficial know|le$ge
of his di&s;po&s;ition; but, in the cour&s;e of
their acquaintance, they have never failed to di&s;|cern
and acknowledge their mi&s;take.</P>
<P>The doctor, on his return from Tunbridge,
to which place he had made a trip by him&s;elf,
found me ill a-$ed, and the whole family in con|fu&s;ion:
&s;urprized and concerned at this di&s;order,
he entered into expo&s;tulation with my lord, who
owned, that the cau&s;e of his di&s;plea&s;ure and di&s;|quiet
was no other than jealou&s;y: H&mdash;had in|formed
him, that I had been &s;een to walk out
with Mr. Bal&mdash;in a morning; and that our cor|re&s;pondence
had been ob&s;erved with many addi|tional
circum&s;tances, which were ab&s;olutely fal&s;e
and groundle&s;s. This imputation was no &s;ooner
under&s;tood, than it was re&s;olved that the accu&s;er
<PB N="189" REF="194">
&s;hould be examined, in pre&s;ence of us all. He
accordingly appeared, exceedingly drunk, tho'
it was morning, and repeated the articles of the
charge, as an information he had received from
a man who came from town to hang the bells,
and was long ago returned to London.</P>
<P>This was an in&s;tance of his cunning and ad|dre&s;s,
which did not for&s;ake him even in his
hours of intoxication. Had he fixed the calumny
on any one of the &s;ervants, he would have been
confronted and detected in his fal&s;hood. Never|thele&s;s,
tho' he could not be legally convicted, it
plainly appeared that he was the author of this
defamation, which incen&s;ed Mr. Bal&mdash;to &s;uch a
degree, that he could &s;carce be with held from
puni&s;hing him on the &s;pot, by manual cha&s;ti&s;e|ment.
However, he was prevailed upon to ab|&s;tain
from &s;uch immediate vengeance, as a &s;tep
unworthy of his character; and the affair was
brought to this i&s;&s;ue, that his lord&s;hip &s;hould ei|ther
part with me or Mr. H&mdash;; for I was fully
determined again&s;t living under the &s;ame roof
with &s;uch an incendiary.</P>
<P>This alternative being propo&s;ed, my lord di&s;|mi&s;s'd
his &s;teward, and we returned to town with
the doctor and Mrs. S&mdash;;for I had imbibed &s;uch
horror and aver&s;ion for this country &s;eat (tho' one
of the plea&s;ante&s;t in England) that I could not
bear to live in it. We therefore removed to an
hou&s;e in Bond-&s;treet, where, according to the
advice of my friends, I exerted my whole power
and complai&s;ance, in endeavours to keep my
hu&s;band in good humour; but was &s;o un&s;ucce&s;s|$$$
in my attempts, that if ever he was wor&s;e
tempered, more capricious, or intolerable, at
one time than at another, this was the &s;ea&s;on in
<PB N="190" REF="195">
which his ill-humour predominated to the mo&s;t
rancorous degree. I was &s;carce ever permitted
to &s;tir abroad, &s;aw no-body at home but my old
male-friend whom I have mentioned above, and
the doctor with his lady, from who&s;e conver&s;a|tion
al&s;o I was at la&s;t excluded.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, I contrived to &s;teal a meeting,
now and then, with my late benefactor, for whom
I entertained a great &s;hare of affection, exclu&s;ive
of that gratitude which was due to his genero&s;ity.
It was not his fault that I compromi&s;ed matters
with my lord; for he was as free of his pur&s;e as
I was unwilling to u&s;e it. It would, therefore,
have been unfriendly, unkind, and ungrateful in
me (now that I was in affluence) to avoid all in|tercour&s;e
with a man who had &s;upported me in
adver&s;ity.&mdash;I think people cannot be too &s;hy and
&s;crupulous in receiving favours; but once they
are conferred, they ought never to forget the
obligation: and I was never more concerned at
any incident of my life, than at hearing that this
gentleman did not receive a letter, in which I
acknowledged the la&s;t proof of his friend&s;hip and
liberality which I had occa&s;ion to u&s;e, becau&s;e I
have &s;ince learned, that he &s;u&s;pected me of ne|glect.</P>
<P>But, to return to my &s;ituation in Bond-&s;treet,
I bore it as well as I could for the &s;pace of three
months, during which I lived in the mid&s;t of
&s;pies who were employed to watch my conduct;
and underwent every mortification that malice,
power, and folly could inflict. Nay, &s;o ridiculous,
&s;o unrea&s;onable was my tyrant in his &s;pleen,
that he declared he would even be jealous of He$|digger,
if there was no other man to incur his
&s;u&s;picion: he expected that I &s;hould &s;pend my
whole time with him, <HI>t&eacute;te a t&eacute;te;</HI> and when I
<PB N="191" REF="196">
&s;acrificed my enjoyment to the&s;e comfortable
parties, he never failed to lay hold on &s;ome inno|cent
expre&s;&s;ion of mine, which he made the
foundation of a quarrel; and when I &s;trove to
avoid the&s;e di&s;agreeable mi&s;interpretations, by
reading or writing, he ince&s;&s;antly teized and tor|mented
me with the imputation of being peevi&s;h,
$ullen and re&s;erved.</P>
<P>Harra&s;&s;ed by this in&s;ufferable behaviour, I
communicated my ca&s;e to Dr. S&mdash;and his lady,
intimating that I neither could nor would expo&s;e
my&s;elf any longer to &s;uch u&s;age. The doctor
exhorted me to bear my fate with patience, and
Mrs. S&mdash;was &s;ilent on the &s;ubject; &s;o that I &s;till
he&s;itated between &s;taying and going, when the
doctor being one night at &s;upper, happened to
have &s;ome words with my lord, who was &s;o vio|lently
tran&s;ported with pa&s;&s;ion, that I was ac|tually
afraid of going to bed with him; and next
morning when he waked, there was &s;uch an ex|pre&s;&s;ion
of frantic wildne&s;s in his countenance,
that I imagined he was actually di&s;tracted.</P>
<P>This alarming circum&s;tance confirmed me in
my re&s;olution of decamping; and I accordingly
moved my quarters to an hou&s;e in Sackville|&s;treet,
where I had lodged when I was a widow;
and when I was &s;ettled, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the
duke of L&mdash;, de&s;iring he would make my lord
acquainted with the place of my abode, my rea|&s;ons
for removing, and my intention to defend
my&s;elf again&s;t all his attempts. The fir&s;t night
of this &s;eparation I went to bed by my&s;elf, with
as much plea&s;ure as a man could do in going to
bed to his mi&s;tre&s;s, whom he had long &s;olicited
in vain. So rejoiced was I to be delivered from
my obnoxious bedfellow!</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="197">
I had not long changed my lodgings, which
I did to Brook-&s;treet, and enjoyed the &s;weets of
my e&s;cape, when I was importuned to return, by
a new &s;teward whom my lord had engaged in the
room of H&mdash;n. This gentleman, who bore a
very fair character, made &s;uch judicious repre|&s;entations,
and behaved &s;o candidly in the di&s;|charge
of his function, that I agreed he &s;hould
act as umpire in the difference between us; and
once more a reconciliation was effected, tho' his
lord&s;hip began to be di&s;&s;atisfied even before the
execution of our agreement, in con&s;equence of
which he attended me to Bath, whither I went
for the benefit of my health, which was not a
little impaired.</P>
<P>This accommodation had a &s;urpri&s;ing effect
upon my lover, who, notwith&s;tanding his re|peated
declarations, that no woman &s;hould ever
gain &s;uch an a&s;cendency over his heart, as to be
able to give him pain, &s;uffered all the agonies of
di&s;appointed love, when he now found him&s;elf
deprived of the opportunities of &s;eeing me, and
behaved very differently from what he had ima|gined
he &s;hould: his words and actions were de&s;|perate;
one of his expre&s;&s;ions to me was, &startq;It
is like twi&s;ting my heart-&s;trings, and tearing
it out of my body.&endq; And I &s;hould never have
done it, had I thoug$t he would have &s;uffered;
but I prote&s;t I believed him when he &s;aid other|wi&s;e
&s;o much, that it was the occa&s;ion of my giv|ing
him up; and it was now too late to re|tract.</P>
<P>In our expedition to the Bath I was ac|companied
by a very agreeable young lady,
with whom I pa&s;'d my time very happily, amid
the diver&s;ions of the place, which &s;$r$ened
<PB N="193" REF="198">
me, in a good mea&s;ure, from the vexatious &s;o|ciety
of my hopeful partner. From this place
we repaired to his &s;eat in the country, where we
&s;pent a few months, and thence returned again
to our hou&s;e in Bond-&s;treet. Here, while I was
confined to my bed by illne&s;s, it was &s;uppo&s;ed
my indi&s;po&s;ition was no other than a private ly|ing
in, tho' I was under the roof with my lord,
and attended by his &s;ervants.</P>
<P>While my di&s;temper continued, my lord (to
do him ju&s;tice) behaved with all imaginable ten|derne&s;s
and care; and his concern on the&s;e occa|&s;ions
I have already mentioned, as a &s;trange in|con&s;i&s;tency
in his di&s;po&s;ition. If his actions were
at all accountable, I &s;hould think he took pains
to fret me into a fever fir&s;t, in order to manife&s;t
his love and humanity afterwards. When I re|covered
my &s;trength and &s;pirits, I went abroad,
&s;aw company, and &s;hould have been ea&s;y, had he
been contented; but as my &s;atisfaction increa&s;ed,
his good humour decayed, and he hani&s;hed, from
his hou&s;e, one by one, all the people who&s;e con|ver&s;ation
could have made my life agreeable.</P>
<P>I often expo&s;tulated with him upon this malig|nant
behaviour, prote&s;ting my de&s;ire of living
peaceably with him; and begging he would not
lay me under the nece&s;&s;ity of changing my mea|&s;ures.
He was deaf to all my remon&s;trances,
(tho' I warned him more than once of the event)
per&s;i&s;ted in his maxims of per&s;ecution; and, after
$epeated quarrels, I again left his hou&s;e, fully de|termined
to &s;uffer all &s;orts of extremity, rather
than &s;ubject my&s;elf to the tyranny of his di&s;po|&s;ition.</P>
<P>This year was productive of one fatal event,
which I felt with the utmo&s;t &s;en&s;ibility of &s;orrow,
<PB N="194" REF="199">
and &s;hall always remember with regret: I mean
the death of Mr. B&mdash;, with whom I had con|&s;tantly
maintained an intimate corre&s;pondence
&s;ince the fir&s;t commencement of our acquaint|ance.
He was one of the mo&s;t valuable m$n, and
promi&s;ed to be one of the brighte&s;t ornaments that
this or any other age had produced. I enjoyed
his friend&s;hip, without re&s;erve; and &s;uch was the
confidence he repo&s;ed in my integrity, from long
experience of my truth, that he often &s;aid he
would believe my bare a&s;&s;ertion, even tho' it
&s;hould contradict the evidence of his own &s;en&s;es,
The&s;e being the terms upon which we lived, it is
not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that I bore the lo&s;s of him
without repining: indeed my grief was un&s;peak|able;
and tho' the edge of it be now &s;moothed
by the lenient hand of time, I &s;hall never cea&s;e
to cheri&s;h his memory with the mo&s;t tender re|membrance.</P>
<P>During the la&s;t period of my living with my
lord, I had agreed to the expediency of obtain|ing
an act of parliament, which would enable
him to pay his debts; on which occa&s;ion there
was a nece&s;&s;ity for cancelling a deed that &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ed
between us, relating to a &s;eparate mainte|nance;
to which, on certain provi&s;os, I was in|titled:
and this was to be &s;et a&s;ide, &s;o far as it
interfered with the above mentioned &s;cheme,
while the re&s;t of it &s;hould remain in force. When
this affair was about to be tran&s;acted, my lord
very generou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted upon my concurrence, in
annulling the whole &s;ettlement; and when I re|fu&s;ed
to comply with this demand, becau&s;e this
was the &s;ole re&s;ource I had again&s;t his ill u&s;age, he
would not proceed in the execution of his plan,
tho' by dropping it he hurt no-body but him&s;elf;
<PB N="195" REF="200">
and accu&s;ed me of having receded from my word,
after I had drawn him into a con&s;iderable ex|pence.</P>
<P>This imputation of breaking my word, which
I defy the wh$le world to prove I ever did, in|cen&s;ed
me the more, as I my&s;elf had propo&s;ed the
&s;cheme for his &s;ervice, altho' I knew the accom|pli&s;hment
of it would endanger the validity of
my own &s;ettlement; and my indignation was
&s;till more augmented by the behaviour of Mr.
G&mdash;, who had always profe&s;&s;ed a regard for my
intere&s;t, and upon my la&s;t accommodation with
my lord, undertaken to effect a reconciliation be|tween
my father and me: but when he was que|&s;tioned
about the particulars of this difference,
and de&s;ired to declare whether his lord&s;hip or I
was to blame, he declined the office of arbitra|tor,
refu&s;ed to be explicit on the &s;ubject, and by
certain &s;hrewd hums and ha's &s;ignified his di&s;ap|probation
of my conduct; and yet this very man,
when I imparted to him, in confidence, my in|tention
of making another retreat, and frankly
$$$ed his opinion of my de&s;ign, &s;eemed to $word$
in the ju&s;tice of it, in the&s;e remarkable
words: &startq;Madam, if I thought, or had hopes
of my lord's growing better, I would down
on my knees, to de&s;ire you to &s;tay; but as I
have not, I &s;ay nothing.&endq;</P>
<P>If he connived at my conduct in this particu|lar,
why &s;hould he di&s;approve of it, when all I
a&s;ked was but common ju&s;tice? But he was a de|pendent;
and therefore I excu&s;e his phlegmatic
not to call it unfriendly) behaviour. Indeed he
could not be too cautious of giving offence to his
$$rd&s;hip, who &s;ometimes made him $eel the $f|fects
of that wrath which other people had
<PB N="196" REF="201">
kindled; particularly, in con&s;equence of a &s;mall
adventure which happened about this very period
of time.</P>
<P>A very agreeable, &s;prightly, good-natured
young man, a near relation of my lord, hap|pening
to be at our hou&s;e one evening, when
there was a fire in the neighbourhood, we agreed
to go and &s;up at a tavern, <HI>en famille;</HI> and hav|ing
&s;pent the evening with great mirth and good
humour, this young gentleman, who was natu|rally
facetious, in taking his leave, &s;aluted us all
round. My lord, who had before entertained
&s;ome jealou&s;y of his kin&s;man, was very much
provoked by this trifling incident, but very pru|dently
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed his di&s;plea&s;ure till he returned to
his own hou&s;e, where his rage co-operating with
the Champagne he had drank, inflamed him to
&s;uch a degree of re&s;olution, that he &s;prung upon
the innocent G&mdash;n, and collared him with great
fury, though he was altogether unconcerned in
the cau&s;e of his indignation.</P>
<P>This extravagant and frantic behaviour, added
to the other grievances under which I laboured,
ha&s;tened my re&s;olution of leaving him; and he
to this day blames his relation, as the immediate
cau&s;e of my e&s;cape, whereas he ought to place it
to the account of his own madne&s;s and indi&s;cre|tion.
When I retired to Park-&s;treet, he c$u|tioned
all my trade&s;men (not even excepting my
baker) again&s;t giving me credit, a&s;&s;uring them
that he would not pay any debts I &s;hould con|tract;
and the difficulties to which I was re|duced,
in con&s;equence of this charitable declara|tion,
together with the reflection of what I had
&s;uffered, and might underg$, from the c$price
and barbarity of his di&s;po&s;ition, affected my
<PB N="197" REF="202">
health &s;o much, that I was taken again ill, and
my life thought in danger.</P>
<P>My con&s;titution, however, got the better of
my di&s;temper, and I was ordered into the coun|try
by my phy&s;icians, for the benefit of the air;
&s;o that I found my&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of keep|ing
two hou&s;es, when I was little able to &s;upport
one, and &s;et up my chariot, becau&s;e I could
not defray the expence of an hackney coach; for
I had as much credit given me as I a&s;k'd for, not|with&s;tanding
my lord's orders to the contrary.</P>
<P>Having recruited my &s;pirits in the country, I
returned to town, and was vi&s;ited by my friends,
who never for&s;ook me in adver&s;ity, and in the
&s;ummer removed to an hou&s;e in E&s;&s;ex, where I
lived a few months in great tranquillity, unmo|le&s;ted
by my tyrant, who &s;ometimes gave me a
whole year's re&s;pite. Here I u&s;ed to ride and
drive by turns (as my humour dictated) with
hor&s;es which were lent me; and I had the com|pany
of my lover, and another gentleman, who
was a very agreeable companion, and of &s;ingu|lar
&s;ervice to me in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, my lord having received intelligence
of the place of my abode, and his tormenting hu|mour
recurring, he &s;et out for my habitation,
and in the morning appeared in his coach and
&s;ix, attended by Mr. G&mdash;n, and another per&s;on,
whom he had engaged for the purpo&s;e, with &s;e|veral
dome&s;ticks armed. I immediately &s;hut up
my doors at his approach, and refu&s;ed him admit|tance,
which he endeavoured to obtain by a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
of prayers and threats; but I was deaf to
both, and re&s;olved to hold out to the la&s;t. See|ing
me determined, he began his attack, and his
&s;ervants actually forced their way into the hou&s;e;
<PB N="198" REF="203">
upon which I retreated up &s;tairs, and fortified
my&s;elf in an apartment, which the a&s;&s;ailants
&s;tormed with &s;uch fury, that the door began to
give way, and I retired into another room.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I remained in this po&s;t, Mr. G&mdash;n
demanded a parley, in which he begg'd I would
favour my lord with an interview, otherwi&s;e he
knew not what would be the con&s;equence. To
this remon&s;trance I replied, that I was not di&s;|po&s;ed
to comply with his reque&s;t; and that
though their de&s;ign &s;hould be murder, I was not
at all a$raid of death. Upon this declaration they
renewed their attacks, which they carried on
with indifferent &s;ucce&s;s till the afternoon, when
my lord (as if he had been at play) &s;ent a formal
me&s;&s;age to me, de&s;iring that all ho&s;tilities &s;hould
cea&s;e, till after both parties &s;hould have dined.
At the &s;ame time, my own &s;ervants came for in|&s;tructions;
and I ordered them to let him have
every thing which he &s;hould call for, as far as the
hou&s;e would afford.</P>
<P>He did not fail to make u&s;e of this permi&s;&s;ion;
but, &s;itting down with his companions, ate up
my dinner without he&s;itation, after he had paid
me the compliment, or de&s;iring to know what he
&s;hould &s;end up to my apartment. Far from hav|ing
any &s;tomach to partake of his meal, I &s;at $word$|tary
upon my bed, in a &s;tate of melancholy ex|pectation,
having fa&s;tened the door of the o$t|ward
room for my &s;ecurity, while I kept my
chamber open for the convenience of air, the
weather being exce&s;&s;ively hot.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip having indulged his appetite, re|&s;umed
his attempt, and all of a &s;udden I heard a
noi&s;e in the next room; upon which I &s;tarted up,
and perceiving that he had got into my anti|chamber,
<PB N="199" REF="204">
by the help of a bench that &s;tood un|der
the window, I flung to the door of my room,
which I locked with great expedition, and open|ing
another that communicated with the &s;tair|ca&s;e,
ran out of the hou&s;e, through a croud of
more than an hundred people, whom this fray
had gathered together.</P>
<P>Being univer&s;ally beloved in the neighbour|hood,
and re&s;pected by my lord's &s;ervants, I
pa&s;&s;ed among them untouched, and took refuge
in a neighbouring cottage; while his lord&s;hip
bawled and roared for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, being afraid to
c$me out as he had got in. Without waiting
for his deliberations, I changed cloaths with the
poor woman who had given me &s;helter, and in
$er clue apron and &s;traw-hat sallied out into the
fields, intending to &s;eek protection at the hou&s;e
of a gentleman not far off, though I was utterly
ignorant of the road that led to it. However, it
was my good fortune to meet with a farmer, who
undertook to conduct me to the place; otherwi&s;e
I &s;hould have mi&s;&s;ed my way, and, in all proba|bility,
lain in the fields; for, by this time, it
was eight o'clock at night.</P>
<P>Under the direction of this guide, I traver&s;ed
$$dges and ditches, (for I would not venture to
navel in the highway, le&s;t I &s;hould fall into the
han's of my pur&s;uer) and after I had actually
tum$led in the mire, and walked &s;ix or &s;even long
$word$ by the help of a good &s;pirit, which never
$word$ me on &s;uch occa&s;ions, I arrived at the
place, and rung the bell at the garden-gate for
admittance. Seeing my figure, which was very
unc$uth, together with my draggled condition,
they denied me entrance; but when they under|&s;tood
who I was, immediately opened the door,
<PB N="200" REF="205">
and I was ho&s;pitably entertained, after having
been the &s;ubject of mirth, on account of my
dre&s;s and adventure.</P>
<P>Next day I returned, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
my hou&s;e again, where I re&s;umed my former
amu&s;ements, which I enjoyed in quiet, for the
&s;pace of a whole month, waiting with re&s;ignation
for the i&s;&s;ue of my law-&s;uit; when one after|noon,
I was apprized of his lord&s;hip's approach,
by one of my &s;pies, whom I always employed to
reconnoitre the road; and &s;o fortunate was I in
the choice of the&s;e &s;couts, that I never was be|trayed
by one of them, though they were often
bribed for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I no &s;ooner received this intelligence, than I
ordered my hor&s;e to be &s;addled, and mounting,
rode out of &s;ight immediately, directing my
cour&s;e a different way from the London road. I
had not long proceeded in this tract, when my
career was all of a &s;udden &s;topp'd by a five-b$r
gate, which, after &s;ome he&s;itation, I re&s;olved to
leap (my hor&s;e being an old hunter) if I &s;hould
find my&s;elf pur&s;ued. However, with much dif|ficulty
I made &s;hift to open it, and arrived in
&s;afety at the hou&s;e of my very good friend Mr.
G&mdash;, who being a ju&s;tice of the peace, had
promi&s;ed me his protection, if it &s;hould be
wanted.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ecured for the pre&s;ent, I &s;ent out &s;pies
to bring information of his lord&s;hip's proceedings,
and under&s;tood that he had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
my hou&s;e, turned my &s;ervants adrift, and made
him&s;elf ma&s;ter of all my moveables, cloaths and
papers. As for the papers, they were of no con|&s;equence,
but of cloaths I had a good &s;tock; and
when I had rea&s;on to believe that he did not in|tend
to relinqui&s;h his conque&s;t, I thought it was
<PB N="201" REF="206">
high time for me to remove to a greater di&s;tance
from his quarters. Accordingly, two days after
my e&s;cape, I &s;et out at eleven o'clock at night,
in a chariot and four, which I borrowed of my
friend, attended by a footman, who was a &s;tout
fellow and well armed, I my&s;elf being provided
with a brace of good pi&s;tols, which I was fully
determined to u&s;e, again&s;t any per&s;on who &s;hould
pre&s;ume to lay violent hands upon me, except
my lord, for whom a le&s;s morral weapon would
have &s;ufficed, &s;uch as a bodkin or a tinder-box.
Nothing could be farther from my intention, than
the de&s;ire of hurting any living creature, much
le&s;s my hu&s;band; my de&s;ign was only to defend
my&s;elf from cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion, which I
knew, by fatal experience, would infallibly be
my lot, &s;hould he get me into his power: and I
thought I had as good a right to pre&s;erve my
happine&s;s, as that which every individual has to
pre&s;erve his life, e&s;pecially again&s;t a &s;et of ruf|fians,
who were engaged to rob me of it, for a
little dirty lucre.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of our journey, the footman
came up, and told me I was dogg'd; upon which
I looked out, and &s;eeing a man riding by the
chariot-&s;ide, pre&s;ented one of my pi&s;tols out at
the window, and pre&s;erved that po&s;ture of de|fence,
until he thought proper to retreat, and
rid me of the fears that attended his company.
I arrived in town, and changing my equipage,
hired an open chai&s;e, in which (though I was al|mo&s;t
&s;tarved with cold) I travelled to Reading,
which I reached by ten next morning; and from
thence proceeded farther in the country, with a
$$ew of taking refuge with Mrs. C&mdash;, who
was my particular friend. Here I &s;hould have
<PB N="202" REF="207">
found &s;helter, though my lord had been before|hand
with me, and endeavoured to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s her
again&s;t my conduct, had not the hou&s;e been
crouded with company, among whom I could
not po&s;&s;ibly have been concealed, e&s;pecially from
her brother, who was an intimate friend of my
per&s;ecutor.</P>
<P>Things being thus &s;ituated, I enjoyed but a
very &s;hort interview with her, in which her &s;or|row
and perplexity on my account appeared with
great expre&s;&s;ion in her countenance; and though
it was not in her power to afford me the relief I
expected, &s;he, in the mo&s;t genteel manner, &s;ent
after me a &s;mall &s;um of money, thinking that,
con&s;idering the hurry in which I left my hou&s;e, I
might have occa&s;ion for it on the road. I was
by this time benumbed with cold, fatigued with
travelling, and almo&s;t fretted to death by my di&s;|appointment.
However, this was no time to in|dulge
de&s;pondence; &s;ince no body could, or
would, a&s;&s;i&s;t me, I &s;tood the more in need of
my own re&s;olution and pre&s;ence of mind. After
&s;ome deliberation, I &s;teered my cour&s;e back to
London; and being unwilling to return by the
&s;ame road in which I came, as well as impatient
to be at the end of my journey, I cho&s;e the Bag|&s;hot
way, and ventured to cro&s;s the heath by
moon-light.</P>
<P>Here I was attacked by a foot-pad armed with
a broad-&s;word, who came up, and demanded my
money. My &s;tock amounted to twelve guineas;
and I fore&s;aw, that &s;hould I be &s;tripp'd of the
whole &s;um, I could not travel without di&s;covering
who I was, and, con&s;equently, running the ri&s;k
of being detected by my pur&s;uer. On the&s;e con|&s;iderations,
I gave the fellow three guineas and
<PB N="203" REF="208">
&s;ome &s;ilver; with which he was &s;o far from being
&s;atisfied, that he threatened to &s;earch me for
m$re: but I ordered the coachman to proceed,
and by good fortune e&s;caped that ceremony;
though I was under &s;ome apprehen&s;ion of being
overtaken with a pi&s;tol-bullet in my flight, and
therefore held down my head in the chai&s;e, in
$$itation of &s;ome great men, who are &s;aid to
have ducked in the &s;ame manner, in the day of
battle.</P>
<P>My fears happened to be di&s;appointed: I lay
at an inn upon the road, and next day arrived in
town, in the utmo&s;t difficulty and di&s;tre&s;s; for I
knew not where to fix my habitation, and was
de&s;titute of all means of &s;upport. In this di|lemma,
I applied to my lawyer, who recom|mended
me to the hou&s;e of a trade&s;man in We&s;t|min&s;ter,
where I lodged and boarded, upon cre|dit,
with my faithful Abigail, (whom I &s;hall di|&s;tingui&s;h
by the name of Mrs. S&mdash;r) for the
&s;pace of ten weeks, during which I &s;aw nobody,
and never once &s;tirred abroad.</P>
<P>While I was thus harra&s;&s;ed out of all enjoy|ment
of life, and reduced to the utmo&s;t indi|gence,
by the cruelty of my per&s;ecut$r, who had
even &s;tr$pp'd me of my wearing apparel, I made
a conque&s;t of lord D&mdash;, a nobleman who is
now dead, and therefore I &s;hall &s;ay little of his
character, which is perfectly well known: this
only will I ob&s;erve, that, next to my own ty|rant,
he was the only per&s;on of whom I had the
greate&s;t abhorrence. Neverthele&s;s, when the&s;e
two came in competition, I preferred the offers
of this new lover, which were very con&s;iderable;
and as an a&s;ylum was the chief thing I wanted,
agreed to follow $$m to his country-&s;eat, whither
<PB N="204" REF="209">
I actually &s;ent my cloaths, which I had purcha&s;ed
upon credit.</P>
<P>However, upon mature deliberation, I changed
my mind, and &s;ignified my re&s;olution in a letter,
de&s;iring at the &s;ame time, that my baggage might
be &s;ent back. In con&s;equence of this me&s;&s;age, I
expected a vi&s;it from him, in all the rage of in|dignation
and di&s;appointment, and gave orders,
that he &s;hould not be admitted into my hou&s;e:
yet, notwith&s;tanding this precaution, he found
means to procure entrance; and one of the fir&s;t
objects that I &s;aw, next morning, in my bed|chamber,
was my lover, armed with his hor&s;e|whip,
again&s;t which (from the knowledge of the
man) I did not think my&s;elf altogether &s;ecure;
though I was not much alarmed, becau&s;e I be|lieved
my&s;elf &s;uperior to him in point of bravery,
&s;hould the wor&s;t come to the wor&s;t: but, con|trary
to my expectation, and his u&s;ual behaviour
to our &s;ex, he acco&s;ted me very politely, and
began to expo&s;tulate upon the contents of my
letter. I freely told him, that I had ra&s;hly a&s;|&s;ented
to his propo&s;al, for my own convenience
only; that when I reflected on what I had done,
I thought it ungenerous in me to live with him
upon the&s;e terms; and that, as I did not like
him, and could not di&s;&s;emble, &s;uch a corre&s;pon|dence
could never tend to the &s;atisfaction of ei|ther.
He allowed the inference was ju&s;t, though
he was very much chagrined at my previous pro|ceeding:
he relinqui&s;hed his claim, re&s;tored my
cloaths, and never afterwards upbraided me with
my conduct in this affair; though he at one time
owned, that he &s;till loved me, and ever &s;hould,
becau&s;e I had u&s;ed him ill; a declaration that
&s;trongly marks the peculiarity of his character.
<PB N="205" REF="210">
As for my own part, I own that my behaviour on
this occa&s;ion, is no other way excu&s;able, than
on account of the mi&s;erable perplexity of my cir|cum&s;tances,
which were often &s;o calamitous,
that I wonder I have not been compelled to take
&s;uch &s;teps, as would have rendered my conduct
much more exceptionable than it really is.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, all my hopes were bla&s;ted by the i&s;&s;ue
of my &s;uit, which was determined in favour of
my lord. Even then I refu&s;ed to yield; on the
contrary, coming out of retirement, I took lodg|ings
in Suffolk-&s;treet, and &s;et my tyrant at de|fiance.
But, being unwilling to tru&s;t my doors
to the care of other people, I took an hou&s;e in
Conduit-&s;treet; and no &s;ooner appeared in the
world again, than I was &s;urrounded by divers
and &s;undry &s;orts of admirers. I believe I received
the incen&s;e and addre&s;&s;es of all kinds under the
&s;un, except that &s;ort which was mo&s;t to my
liking, a man capable of contracting and in|&s;paing
a mutual attachment; but &s;uch a one is
equally rare and ine&s;timable: not but that I own
my&s;elf greatly obliged to all tho&s;e who cultivated
my good graces, though they were very little be|holden
to me; for, where I did not really love, I
could never profe&s;s that pa&s;&s;ion: that &s;ort of di&s;&s;i|mulation
is a &s;lavery that no hone&s;t nature will un|dergo.
Except one worthy young man whom I
&s;ometimes &s;aw, they were a &s;trange medley of
in&s;ignificant beings; one was in&s;ipid, another
ridiculou&s;ly affected, a third void of all education,
a fourth altogether incon&s;i&s;tent; and in &s;hort, I
found as many trifling characters among the men,
as ever I ob&s;erved in my own &s;ex. Some of them
I endeavoured to bring over to my maxims,
whole they attempted to make a pro&s;ely t$ of me;
<PB N="206" REF="211">
but finding the ta&s;k impracticable on both &s;ides,
we very wi&s;ely dropt each other.</P>
<P>At length, however, I was ble&s;&s;ed with the ac|quaintance
of one nobleman, who is, perhaps,
the fir&s;t character in England, in point of ho|nour,
integrity, wit, &s;en&s;e and benevolence:
when I have thus di&s;tingui&s;hed him, I need
&s;carce mention lord&mdash;. This great, this
good man, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es every accompli&s;hment re|qui&s;ite
to in&s;pire admiration, love and e&s;teem.
With infinitely more merit than almo&s;t ever fell
to one man's &s;hare, he manife&s;ts &s;uch diffidence
of his own qualifications, as cannot fail to pre|po&s;&s;e&s;s
every company in his favour. He &s;eems
to ob&s;erve nothing, yet &s;ees every thing; his
manner of telling a &s;tory, and making trifles ele|gant,
is peculiar to him&s;elf; and though he has a
thou&s;and oddities, they &s;erve only to make him
more agreeable. After what I have &s;aid, it may
be &s;uppo&s;ed that I was enamoured of his per&s;on:
but this was not the ca&s;e; love is altogether ca|pricious
and fanciful; yet I admire, honour, and
e&s;teem him to the highe&s;t degree; and when I
ob&s;erve, that his character re&s;embled that of my
dear departed friend Mr. B&mdash;; or rather, that
Mr. B&mdash;, had he lived, would have re&s;embled
lord&mdash;, I pay the highe&s;t compliment I
can conceive both to the living and the dead.</P>
<P>In this nobleman's friend&s;hip and conver&s;ation
I thought my&s;elf happy; though I was, as u&s;ual,
expo&s;ed to the indefatigable efforts of my lord,
who, one day, while I was favoured with the
company of this generous friend, appeared at my
door in his coach, attended by another gentle|man,
who demanded entrance, with an air of
authority. A very hone&s;t footman, who had
<PB N="207" REF="212">
been long in my &s;ervice, ran up &s;tairs in the ut|mo&s;t
con&s;ternation, and gave me an account of
what had happened below. Upon which, I told
him he had nothing to an&s;wer for, and ordered
him to keep the door fa&s;t &s;hut again&s;t all oppo&s;i|tion:
though I was &s;o much affected with this
unexpected a&s;&s;ault, that lord&mdash;&s;aid, he
w$s never more &s;urprized and &s;hocked in his life,
than at the horror which appeared in my coun|tenance,
when I &s;aw the coach &s;top at my door.</P>
<P>My little hero being refu&s;ed admittance, went
away, threatening to return &s;peedily with a re|inforcement;
and during this interval, I provided
my&s;elf with a &s;oldier, whom I placed centinel at
the door within&s;ide, to guard me from the danger
of &s;uch a&s;&s;aults for the future. My lord, true to
$word$ promi&s;e, marched back with his auxiliaries,
r$nforced with a con&s;table, and repeated his de|mand
of being admitted; and my &s;oldier open|ing
the &s;a&s;h, in order to an&s;wer him according
to my directions, he no &s;ooner perceived the red
$word$ than he was &s;eized with &s;uch a pannic, that
he in&s;tantly fled with great precipitation; and
when he recounted the adventure, like Fal&s;taff in
the $word$ multiplied my guard into a whole sile
o$ ma&s;queteers. He al&s;o made shift to di&s;cover
the gentleman, who had been &s;o kind as to lend
me one of his company, and complained of him
to the duke of N&mdash;, in hopes of &s;eeing him
$roke for this mi&s;demeanour; but in that expec|$word$
he was luckily di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>$word$ that in England I &s;hould never en|$word$
$word$, but be continually &s;ubject to tho&s;e
$word$ and di&s;quiets which had already impaired
my health and &s;pirits, I re&s;olved to repair again
$word$, my be&s;t refuge and &s;ure retreat from
<PB N="208" REF="213">
the per&s;ecution of my tyrant. Yet, before I
took this &s;tep, I endeavoured, by the adv$ce of
my friends, to conceal my&s;elf near Windsor;
but was in a little time di&s;covered by my lord,
and hunted out of my lurking place, accordingly.
I then removed to Chel&s;ea, where I &s;uffered in|conceivable
unea&s;ine&s;s and agitation of m$nd,
from the nature of my &s;ituation, my tranquil$ity
being thus ince&s;&s;antly invaded by a man who
could not be &s;atisfied with me, and yet could not
live without me: &s;o that, though I was very
much indi&s;po&s;ed, I &s;et out for France, by the
way of the Hague, as the war had &s;hut up all
other communication, having no other attendant
but my woman S&mdash;r, who, though &s;he dreaded
the &s;ea, and was upon the brink of matrimony,
would not quit me in &s;uch a calamitous condition,
until I was joined by my footman and other
maid, whom I ordered to follow me with the
baggage. But, before my departure, I &s;ent a
me&s;&s;age to lord&mdash;, demanding my cloaths,
which he had &s;eized in E&s;&s;ex; and he refu&s;ing to
deliver them, I was obliged to equip my&s;elf anew,
upon credit.</P>
<P>I was &s;upplied with money for my journey by
my good friend L&mdash;; and after a &s;hort and
plea&s;ant pa&s;&s;age, arrived at the Hague, where I
&s;tayed two months, and parted with S&mdash;r, on
whom I &s;ettled an annuity of five and twenty
pounds, payable out of the provi&s;ion which I had
or might obtain from my hu&s;band. The &s;ame
allowance had I prevailed upon lord B&mdash;to
grant to another maid, who attended me while
I lived in his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I did not much reli&s;h the people in Holland,
becau&s;e they &s;eemed entirely devoted to &s;elf-in|tere&s;t,
<PB N="209" REF="214">
without any ta&s;te for plea&s;ure or polite|ne&s;s;
a &s;pecies of di&s;po&s;ition that could not be
very agreeable to me, who always de&s;pi&s;ed mo|ney,
had an unbounded benevolence of heart,
and loved plea&s;ure beyond every other con&s;idera|tion.
When I &s;ay plea&s;ure, I would not be un|der&s;tood
to mean &s;en&s;uality, which con&s;titutes
the &s;upreme happine&s;s of tho&s;e only, who are
void of &s;entiment and imagination. Neverthe|le&s;s,
I received &s;ome civilities in this place; and
among the re&s;t, the reputation of having for my
lever the king of P&mdash;'s mini&s;ter, who was young
and airy, and vi&s;ited me often; circum&s;tances that
were &s;ufficient to lay me under the imputation of
an amour, which I frequently incurred, without
having given the lea&s;t cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>Having taken leave of my Dutch friends, I
departed from the Hague, in company with an
Engli&s;hwoman, whom I had cho&s;e for that pur|po&s;e,
and arrived at Antwerp, with much diffi|culty
and danger, the highway being infe&s;ted
with robbers. After having repo&s;ed my&s;elf a few
da$s in this city, I hired a coach for my&s;elf, and
&s;et out, with my companion, for Bru&s;&s;els; but,
before we reached Mechlin, our vehicle was at|tacked
by two hu&s;&s;ars, who, with their sabres
drawn, obliged the coachman to drive into a
wood near the road. I at fir&s;t imagined they
wanted to examine o$r pa&s;&s;ports, bat was &s;oon
too well convinced of their de&s;ign; and though
very much &s;hocked at the di&s;covery, found re&s;o|lution
enough to &s;uppre&s;s my concern, &s;o that it
&s;hould not aggravate the terrors of the young
woman, who had almo&s;t died with apprehen&s;ion.
I even encouraged her to hope for the be&s;t; and
addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to the robbers in French, begg'd
in the mo&s;t &s;uppliant manner, that they would
<PB N="210" REF="215">
&s;pare our lives; upon which, one of them, who
was a little fellow, a&s;&s;ured me in the &s;ame lan|guage,
that we had nothing to fear for our
per&s;ons.</P>
<P>When we were conveyed in a &s;tate of dreadful
&s;u&s;pence about three quarters of a mile into the
wood, the ruffians came into the coach, and tak|ing
my keys, which I kept ready in my hand
for them, opened three large trunks, that con|tained
my baggage, and emptying them of every
thing but my hoops and a few books, packed up
their booty in a cloth; then robbing me of my
money and jewels, even to my &s;hoe-buckles and
&s;leeve-buttons, took my footman's laced hat,
and gave it, by way of gratification, to a pea&s;ant,
who came from behind the bu&s;hes, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted
them in packing.</P>
<P>This affair being di&s;patched, they ordered us
to return to the road, by a different way from
that in which we were carried into the wood;
and mounting their hor&s;es, rode off with the
plunder, though not before the little fellow, who
was the lea&s;t ferocious of the two, had come and
&s;haken me by the hand, wi&s;hing us a good jour|ney;
a compliment which I heartily returned,
being extremely well plea&s;ed at the retreat of two
&s;uch companions, who had detained us a whole
half hour; during which, notwith&s;tanding the
a&s;&s;urance I had received, I was in continual ap|prehen&s;ion
of &s;eeing their operation conclude
with the murder of us all; for I &s;uppo&s;ed they
were of that gang, who had &s;ome time before
murthered a French officer, and u&s;ed a lady ex|tremely
ill, after having rifled her of all &s;he had.</P>
<P>Having thus undergone pillage, and being re|duced
to the extremity of indigence in a foreign
<PB N="211" REF="216">
land, it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that my reflections
were very comfortable; and yet, though I &s;u|&s;tained
the whole damage, I was the only per&s;on
in the company who bore the accident with any
re&s;olution and pre&s;ence of mind. My coachman
and valet &s;eemed quite petrified with sear; and it
was not, till I had repeated my directions, that
the former drove farther into the wood, and took
the fir&s;t turning to the right, in order to re+gain
the road, according to the command of the
robbers, which I did not choo&s;e to di&s;obey.</P>
<P>This misfortune I &s;uffered by the mi&s;informa|tion
I received at Antwerp, where I would have
provided my&s;elf with an e&s;cort, had I not been
a&s;&s;ured, that there was not the lea&s;t occa&s;ion to
put my&s;elf to &s;uch extraordinary expence: and
indeed, the robbers took the only half hour in
which they could have had an opportunity of
plundering us; for we no &s;ooner returned into
the Highway, than we met with the French ar|tillery
coming from Bru&s;&s;els, which was a &s;ecu|rity
to us, during the re&s;t of our journey. We
were afterwards informed at a &s;mall village, that
there was actually a large gang of de&s;erters, who
harboured in that wood, from which they made
excur&s;ions in the neighbourhood, and kept the
pea&s;ants in continual alarms.</P>
<P>Having proceeded a little way, we were &s;topp'd
by the artillery cro&s;&s;ing a bridge; and as the
train was very long, mu&s;t have been detained til$
night, had not a &s;oldier informed me, that if I
would take the trouble to come out of my coach,
and apply to the commandant, he would order
them to halt, and allow me to pa&s;s. I took the
man's advice, and was by him conducted, with
much difficulty, through the croud to &s;ome of|ficers,
<PB N="212" REF="217">
who &s;eemed &s;carce to de&s;erve the name;
for, when I &s;ignified my reque&s;t, they neither
ro&s;e up, nor de&s;ired me to &s;it down; but lo$$ing
in their chairs, with one leg &s;tretched out, a&s;ked,
with an air of di&s;re&s;pectful raillery, where I was
going; and when I an&s;wered, &startq;To Paris;&endq; de|&s;ired
to know what I would do there.</P>
<P>I, who am naturally civil where I am civilly
u&s;ed, and &s;aucy enough where I think my&s;elf
treated with di&s;regard, was very much piqued at
their in&s;olent and unmannerly behaviour, and be|gan
to reply to their impertinent que&s;tions, very
abruptly; &s;o that a very tart dialogue would have
en&s;ued, had not the conver&s;ation been interrupted
by a tall, thin, genteel young French nobleman,
an officer in the army, who chancing to come in,
a&s;ked with great politene&s;s, what I would plea&s;e
to have. I then repeated my de&s;ire, and pro|duced
my pa&s;&s;ports, by which he learn'd who I
was. He immediately gave orders, that my
coach &s;hould pa&s;s; and afterwards vi&s;ited me at
Paris, having obtained my permi&s;&s;ion, and taken
my addre&s;s at parting; while the others, under|&s;tanding
my name and quality, a&s;ked pardon for
their impolite carriage, which they told me was
owing to the repre&s;entation of the &s;oldier, who
gave them to under&s;tand, that I was a &s;trolling
actre&s;s.</P>
<P>I could not help laughing heartily at this mi|&s;take,
which might have proceeded from the cir|cum&s;tances
of my appearance, my footman hav|ing
been obliged to change hats with the pea&s;ant,
and my&s;elf being without buckles in my &s;hoes,
and buttons in my riding-&s;hirt, while my counte|nance
&s;till retained marks of the fear and confu|&s;ion
I had undergone. After all, perhaps the fel|low
<PB N="213" REF="218">
was a droll, and wanted to entertain him|&s;elf
at my expence.</P>
<P>The day was &s;o far con&s;umed in the&s;e adven|tures,
that I was obliged to take up my lodging
at Mechlin, where I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to the in|tendant,
giving him an account of the di&s;a&s;ter I
had met with, and de&s;iring I might have credit
at the inn, as our whole company could not rai&s;e
the value of a &s;ix-pence. This gentleman, tho'
a provincial, was polite in his way, and not only
granted my reque&s;t, but invited me to lodge at
his own hou&s;e. I accordingly gave him my com|pany
at &s;upper, but did not choo&s;e to &s;leep in his
quarters, becau&s;e he appeared to be what the
French call <HI>un vieux debauch&eacute;.</HI></P>
<P>Next day, he &s;ent a trumpet to the general,
with a detail of my misfortune, in hopes of re|trieving
what I had lo&s;t; but, notwith&s;tanding
all po&s;&s;ible &s;earch, I was fain to put up with my
damage, which, in linen, laces, cloaths and bau|bles,
amounted to upwards of &s;even hundred
pounds: a lo&s;s which never deprived me of one
moment's re&s;t; for though I lodged at a mi&s;e|rable
$word$, and lay in a paultry bed, I &s;lept as
&s;$und as if nothing extraordinary had happened,
after I had written to London and Paris, direct|ing
that the payment of my bills of credit might
be &s;topp'd. Indeed, I know but of two misfor|tunes
in life, capable of depre&s;&s;ing my &s;pirits,
namely, the lo&s;s of health and friends; all others
may be prevented, or endured. The articles of
that calamity, which I chiefly regretted, were a
picture of lord W&mdash;m, and &s;ome inimitable
letters from Mr. B&mdash;.</P>
<P>From Mechlin I proceeded to Bru&s;&s;els, where
being known, I got credit for &s;ome nece&s;&s;aries,
<PB N="214" REF="219">
and borrowed twenty guineas, to defray the ex|pence
of my journey to Paris. Having con&s;ulted
with my friends, about the &s;afe&s;t method of tra|velling
through Flanders, I was per&s;uaded to
take places in the public Voiture; and accord|ingly
departed, not without fears of finding one
part of the country as much infe&s;ted with robbers
as another. Nor were the&s;e apprehen&s;ions a&s;|&s;uaged
by the conver&s;ation of my fellow-travellers,
who being of the lower &s;ort of people, that de|light
in exaggerating dangers, entertained me all
the way, with an account of all the robberies
and murders which had been committed on that
road, with many additional circum&s;tances of their
own invention.</P>
<P>After having been two days expo&s;ed to this
comfortable conver&s;ation, among very di&s;agree|able
company, which is certainly one of the mo&s;t
di&s;agreeable &s;ituations in life, I arrived at Li&s;le,
where, thinking the dangerous part of the jour|ney
was now pa&s;t, I hired a po&s;t-chai&s;e, and in
two days more reached Paris, without any farther
mol$&s;tation.</P>
<P>Upon my arrival in this capital, I was imme|diately
vi&s;ited by my old acquaintances, who
hearing my di&s;a&s;ter, offered me their cloaths, and
in&s;i&s;ted upon my wearing them, until I could be
otherwi&s;e provided. They likewi&s;e engaged me
$word$ parties, with a view of amu&s;ing my imagina|tion,
that I might not grow melancholy in re|flecting
upon my lo&s;s; and de&s;ired me to repeat
the particulars of my &s;tory forty times over, ex|pre&s;&s;ing
great &s;urprize at our not being mur|thered,
or ravi&s;hed at lea&s;t. As for this la&s;t &s;p$|$word$
of outrage, the fear of it never once entered
my he$d, otherwi&s;e I &s;hould have been more
<PB N="215" REF="220">
&s;hocked and alarmed than I really was: but it
&s;eems this was the chief circum&s;tance of my
companion's apprehen&s;ion; and I cannot help ob|&s;erving,
that an homely woman is always more
apt to entertain tho&s;e fears, than one who&s;e per|&s;on
expo&s;es her to much more imminent danger.
However, I now learned, that the ri&s;k I ran was
much greater than I imagined it to be, tho&s;e ruf|fians
being familiarized to rape as well as murder.</P>
<P>Soon after my appearance in Paris, I was fa|voured
with the addre&s;&s;es of &s;everal French lo|vers;
but I never had any ta&s;te for foreigners, or
indeed for any amu&s;ement of that kind, except
&s;uch as were likely to be la&s;ting, and &s;ettled upon
a more agreeable footing than that of common
gallantry. When I deviated from this principle,
my conduct was the effect of compul&s;ion, and
theref$re I was never ea&s;y under it, having been
reduced to the alternative of two evils, the lea&s;t
of which I was obliged to choo&s;e, as a man leaps
into the &s;ea, in order to e&s;cape from a &s;hip that is
on fire.</P>
<P>Though I rejected their love, I did not refu&s;e
their company and conver&s;ation; and though my
health was con&s;iderably impaired by the &s;hock I
received in my la&s;t adventure, which was con|&s;iderably
greater than I at fir&s;t imagined, and af|fected
my companion &s;o much, that &s;he did not
recover her &s;pirits, till &s;he returned to England:
I &s;ay, though I was for &s;ome time a valetudina|rian,
I enjoyed my&s;elf in great tranquillity for the
&s;pace of ten months, during which I was vi&s;ited
by Engli&s;h, Scotch, and French, of all parties and
per&s;ua&s;ions; for plea&s;ure is of no faction, and
that was the chief object of my pur&s;uit; neither
was I &s;o ambitious of being a politician, as to
<PB N="216" REF="221">
employ my time and thoughts upon &s;ubjects
which I did not under&s;tand. I had admirers of
all &s;ides, and &s;hould have &s;pent my time very
much to my liking, had not I felt my funds &s;en|&s;ibly
dimini&s;h, without any pro&s;pect of their being
repaired; $or I had been obliged to lay out a great
part of the &s;um allotted for my &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, in
&s;upplying my companion, my &s;ervant and my&s;elf
with nece&s;&s;aries, in lieu of tho&s;e which we had
lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Having before mine eyes the uncomfortable
pro&s;pect of wanting money in a &s;trange place, I
found my&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of returning to
England, where I had more re&s;ources than I could
po&s;&s;ibly have among foreigners; and with that
view wrote to lord&mdash;'s agents, de&s;iring that I
might be enabled to di&s;charge my obligations at
Paris, by the payment of my pin-money. Thus
a negotiation commenced, and his lord&s;hip pro|mi&s;ed
to remit money for the clearance of my
Paris debts, which amounted to four hundred
pounds: but he would not advance one farthing
more, though I gave him to under&s;tand, that
while he protracted the agreement, I mu&s;t inevi|tably
be adding to my incumbrances, and that I
&s;hould be as effectually detained by a debt of
twenty pounds, as if I owed a thou&s;and. Not|with&s;tanding
all my repre&s;entation, he would
not part with one &s;hilling over the neat &s;um which
I had at fir&s;t &s;tipulated; &s;o that all my mea&s;ures
were rendered abortive, and I found it altogether
impracticable to execute tho&s;e re&s;olutions I had
formed in his favour.</P>
<P>Thus did he, for a meer trifle, embarra&s;s the
woman $o whom he profe&s;&s;es the mo&s;t unlimited
love, and who&s;e principles he pretends to hold in
<PB N="217" REF="222">
the utmo&s;t veneration. Indeed his confidence in
my integrity is not without foundation; for many
wives, with one half of my provocation, would
have ruined him to all intents and purpo&s;es;
whereas, notwith&s;tanding all the extraordinary
expences, to which I have been expo&s;ed by his
continual per&s;ecution, he never paid a &s;hilling on
my account, except one thou&s;and pounds, ex|clu&s;ive
of the &s;mall allowance which was my
due. In a word, &s;o much time elap&s;ed before
my lord could prevail upon him&s;elf to advance
the bare four hundred, that I was involved in
fre&s;h difficulties, from which I found it impo&s;&s;ible
to extricate my&s;elf: and though I had occa&s;ion
to write a letter to my benefactor lord&mdash;, in
which I expre&s;&s;ed my acknowledgment for pa&s;t
favours, I could not venture to &s;ollicit m$re;
even when I was encouraged by a very obliging
an&s;wer, wherein he declared, that the good qua|lities
of my mind and heart, would bind him to
me in friend&s;hip for ever.</P>
<P>While I ruminated on my uncomfortable &s;itua|tion,
which would neither permit me to return
to England, nor to &s;tay much longer where I
was, a young Engli&s;hman of immen&s;e fortune
took Paris in his way from Italy, accompanied
by a mo&s;t agreeable Scotchman of very good
&s;en&s;e and great vivacity. It was my good or ill
fortune to become acquainted with the&s;e gentle|m$n,
who having &s;een me at the opera, expre&s;&s;ed
a de&s;ire of being known to me, and accordingly
favoured me with a vi&s;it one afternoon, when the
bri&s;k North Briton ingro&s;&s;ed the whole conver&s;a|tion;
while the other &s;eemed fearful and diffident
even to a degree of ba&s;hfulne&s;s, through which,
however, I could di&s;cern a delicate &s;en&s;ibility
<PB N="218" REF="223">
and uncommon under&s;tanding: there was in his
per&s;on (which was very agreeable) as well as in
his behaviour, a certain <HI>naivet&egrave;</HI> that was very
plea&s;ing; and at this fir&s;t interview, we reli&s;hed
each other's company &s;o well, that a &s;ort of inti|macy
immediately commenced, and was car|ried
on in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of parties of plea&s;ure, in
the cour&s;e of which I found him fraught with all
the tenderne&s;s and &s;entiment that render the
heart &s;u&s;ceptible of the mo&s;t refined love; a di&s;|po&s;ition
that immediately made me partial to him,
while it &s;ubjected his own heart to all the violent
impre&s;&s;ions of a pa&s;&s;ion, which I little imagined
our corre&s;pondence would have produced.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, I was far from being di&s;plea&s;ed
with my conque&s;t, becau&s;e his per&s;on and qualifi|cations,
as well as his manner of addre&s;s, were
very much to my liking, and recommended him
in a particular manner to my affection. Indeed,
he made a greater progre&s;s in my heart than I
my&s;elf &s;u&s;pected; for there was &s;omething con|genial
in our &s;ouls, which from our fir&s;t meeting
I believe had attracted us (unknown to our&s;elves)
under the notions of friend&s;hip and regard, and
now di&s;clo&s;ed it&s;elf in the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate love.</P>
<P>I li$tened to his addre&s;&s;es, and we were truly
happy. His attachment was the quinte&s;&s;ence of
tenderne&s;s and &s;incerity, while his genero&s;ity
knew no bound. Not contented with having
paid twelve hundred pounds on my account, $n
the &s;pace of one fortnight, he would have loaded
me with pre&s;ent after pre&s;ent, had not I ab&s;o|lutely
re u&s;ed to accept &s;uch expen&s;ive marks of
his munificence. I was even morti$ied at tho&s;e
in&s;tances of his liberality, which my &s;ituation
$word$ me to receive, left, being but little
<PB N="219" REF="224">
acquainted with my di&s;po&s;ition, he &s;hould &s;u&s;pect
me of being intere&s;ted in my love, and judge
my conduct by the malicious reports of common
&s;ame, which (he afterwards owned) had at fir&s;t
obtained &s;uch credit with him, that he believed
our mutual attachment would not be of long du|ration.
But, in this particular, he was &s;oon unde|ceived:
his heart, though naturally adapted for
the melting pa&s;&s;ion, had hitherto e&s;caped un|touched
by all the ladies of Italy and France;
and therefore the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions were the more
deeply fixed. As he was unpracti&s;ed in the ways
of common gallantry and deceit, the &s;triking
&s;implicity in his character was the more likely to
engage the heart of one who knew the perfidy
of the world, and de&s;pi&s;ed all the farce and bom|ba&s;t
of fa&s;hionable profe&s;&s;ion, which I had always
con&s;idered as the phra&s;e of vanity and o&s;tenta|tion,
rather than the genuine language of love.
Be&s;ides, gratitude had a con&s;iderable &s;hare in aug|menting
my affection, which manife&s;ted it&s;elf in
&s;uch a warm, cordial, artle&s;s manner, as in|crea&s;ed
his e&s;teem, and rivetted his attachment;
for he could ea&s;ily perceive, from the whole te|nour
of my conduct, that my brea&s;t was an utter
&s;tranger to cra&s;t and di&s;&s;imulation: yet I was at
fir&s;t fearful of contracting any engagement with
him, becau&s;e, being younger than me, he might
be the more apt to change, and the world might
be malicious enough to &s;uppo&s;e I had practi&s;ed
upon his inexperience; but, con&s;cious of my
own integrity, I &s;$t &s;$$nder at defiance, tru&s;ting
to my own behaviour, and his natural probity,
for the continuance of his love. Though we
$word$ not l$ve together in the &s;ame hou&s;e, the
greate&s;t part of our time was &s;pent in each other's
<PB N="220" REF="225">
company; we dined and &s;upped at the &s;ame ta|ble,
frequented public places, went upon parties
to the country, and never parted, but for a few
hours in the night, which we pa&s;&s;ed in the utmo&s;t
impatience to meet again.</P>
<P>In this agreeable manner did the days roll on,
when my felicity was interrupted by a fit of jea|lou&s;y
with which I happened to be &s;eized, I had
contracted an acquaintance with a young married
lady, who, though her per&s;onal attractions were
but &s;lender, was, upon the whole, an agreeable,
chearful, good-natured companion, with a little
da&s;h of the coquette in her compo&s;ition. This
woman being in very indigent circum&s;tances, oc|ca&s;ioned
by &s;ome lo&s;&s;es her hu&s;band had &s;u&s;tained,
no &s;ooner had an opportunity of &s;eeing and con|ver&s;ing
with my lover, than &s;he formed the de|&s;ign
of making a conque&s;t of him. I &s;hould
have forgiven her for this &s;cheme, whatever
pangs it might have co&s;t $word$ $word$ I believed it
the effect of real pa&s;&s;ion; $ut I knew her too
well, to &s;uppo&s;e her heart was $word$ of
love, and accordingly $word$ it. In the execu|tion
of her plan, &s;he $word$ nothing which
&s;he thought capable $word$ his attention.
She took al$ $$portunities of $word$ near him at
table, og$ed him in the mo&s;t palpable manner,
directed her whole $word$ to him, trod upon
his toes; nay, I be$i$ve, &s;queezed his $and.
My bl$od $word$ at her though my pride, for
&s;$me time, $word$ me to conceal my un$a&s;ine&s;s:
till at length $span$ became &s;o arrogant
and gro&s;s, that I couldn$ l$$ger &s;uppre&s;s my in|dignation,
and one day told my lover, that I
would immediately renounce his corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="226">
He was greatly alarmed at this unexpected de|claration;
and when he under&s;tood the cau&s;e of
it, a&s;&s;ured me, that for the future he would ne|ver
exchange one word with her. Satisfied with
this mark of his &s;incerity and regard, I relea&s;ed
him $rom this promi&s;e, which he could not po&s;|&s;ibly
keep, while &s;he and I lived upon any terms;
and we continued to vi&s;it each other as u&s;ual,
though &s;he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in her endeavours to
$ival me in his affection, and contracted an inti|macy
with his companion, who &s;eemed to enter|tain
a pa&s;&s;ion for her, that &s;he might have the
more frequent opportunities of being among us;
for &s;he had no objection again&s;t favouring the
addre&s;&s;es of both. One evening, I remember,
we &s;et out in my coach for the opera; and in the
way, this inamorata was &s;o bu&s;y with her feet,
that I was incen&s;ed at her behaviour; and when
we arrived at the place, refu&s;ed to alight; but, &s;et|ting
them down, declared my intention of return|ing
home immediately. She was &s;o much plea&s;ed
with this intimation, that &s;he could not conceal the
joy &s;he felt at the thoughts of conver&s;ing with
him, uninterrupted by my pre&s;ence; an oppor|tunity
with which I had never favoured her be|f$re.
This open exultation increa&s;ed my anger
and anxiety: I went home; but, being &s;till tor|tured
with the reflection of having left them to|gether,
adju&s;ted my&s;elf in the gla&s;s, though I
was too angry to take notice of my own figure,
and without farther delay returned to the opera.</P>
<P>Having inquired for the box in which they &s;at,
I took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one that fronted them, and
reconnoitring them, without being perceived,
had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing him removed to as
great a di&s;tance from her as the place would per|mit,
<PB N="222" REF="227">
and his head turned another way. Com|po&s;ed
by this examination, I joined them with|out
further &s;cruple, when my young gentleman
expre&s;&s;ed great joy at my appearance, and told
me he was determined to have left the entertain|ment,
and come in que&s;t of me, had not I re|turned
at that in&s;tant.</P>
<P>In our way homewards, my rival repeated her
u&s;ual hints, and with her large hoop almo&s;t over|&s;hadowed
my lover from my view: upon which
my jealou&s;y and wrath recurred with &s;uch vio|lence,
that I pulled the &s;tring, as a &s;ignal for the
coachman to &s;top, with a view of getting out,
and going home afoot; a &s;tep which would have
afforded a new &s;pectacle to the people of Paris,
But I reflected, in a moment, upon the folly of
&s;uch a re&s;olution, and &s;oon recollected my&s;elf,
by calling my pride to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I deter|mined,
however, that &s;he &s;hould act no more
&s;cenes of this kind in my pre&s;ence, and that &s;ame
night in&s;i&s;ted upon my lover's dropping all inter|cour&s;e
and connexion with this tormentor. He
very chearfully complied with my de&s;ire, and was
even glad of an occa&s;ion to break off his acquaint|ance
with a per&s;on about whom I had plagued
him &s;o much.</P>
<P>Thus was I freed from the per&s;ecution of one
of tho&s;e creatures, who, tho' of little con&s;e|quence
in them&s;elves, are yet the pe&s;ts of &s;o|ciety,
and find means to de&s;troy that harmony
which reigns between two lovers, by the intru|&s;ion
of a loo&s;e appetite, void of all &s;en&s;ibility and
di&s;cretion: having no feeling them&s;elves, they
cannot &s;ympathize with that of other people, and
do mi&s;chief out of meer wantonne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="228">
My lover being obliged to go to England, had
&s;$ttled me in a genteel hou&s;e in Paris, with a
view of returning when his affairs &s;hould be ad|ju&s;ted;
but when the time of his departure ap|proached,
he began to be unea&s;y at the pro&s;pect
of &s;eparation, and, in order to alleviate his
anxiety, de&s;ired me to accompany him to Ca|lais,
where we &s;tayed together three or four
days, during which the dread of parting became
more and more inten&s;e: &s;o that we determined
upon my following him into England, by the
fir&s;t opportunity, where I &s;hould live altogether
<HI>incog,</HI> that I might be concealed from the inqui|ries
and attempts of my lord. Even after this
re&s;olution was fixed, we parted with all the ago|nies
of lovers who de&s;pair of ever meeting again;
and the wind blowing very high after he had im|barked,
increa&s;ed my fears. But by the return
or the packet-boat, I was ble&s;&s;ed with the report
of his being &s;afe arrived in England, and had the
&s;atisfaction of peru&s;ing his letters by every po&s;t.</P>
<P>My admirer being thus detached from me, my
thoughts were intirely employed in concerting
&s;ome private method of conveying my&s;elf to him.
As I would not tru&s;t my&s;elf in the common
packet, for fear of being di&s;covered, after hav|ing
revolved divers &s;chemes, I determined to tran&s;|port
my&s;elf in one of the Dutch fi&s;hing-boats,
tho' I knew the pa&s;&s;age would be hazardous;
but, in a ca&s;e of &s;uch intere&s;ting concern, I over|looked
all danger and inconvenience. Before I
put this re&s;olution in practice, I was &s;o fortunate
as to hear of a &s;mall Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el that arrived at
Calais with a pri&s;oner of war, in which I em|barked
with my companion, and another lady,
who lived with me for &s;ome time afterwards;
<PB N="224" REF="229">
and when we came on board, di&s;covered that the
&s;hip was no other than a light collier, and that
her whole company amounted to no more than
three men. Neverthele&s;s, tho' the &s;ea was to
rough, and the weather &s;o unpromi&s;ing, that no
other boat would venture to put to &s;ea. we &s;et
&s;ail, and between two &s;torms, in about three
hours arrived in &s;afety at Dover.</P>
<P>From hence my fir&s;t companion went to her
friends, in the &s;tage coach, while the other lady
and I hired an open po&s;t-chai&s;e (tho' it &s;nowed
very hard) and without any accident performed
our journey to London, where I met with my
lover, who flew to my arms in all the tran&s;ports
of impatient joy; and, doubtle&s;s, I de&s;erved his
affection, for the hard&s;hips, perils, and difficul|ties
I had undergone to be with him; for I never
&s;crupled to undertake any thing practicable, in
order to demon&s;trate the &s;incerity of what I pro|fe&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of our plan, I a&s;&s;umed a ficti|tious
name, and never appeared in publick, be|ing
fully &s;atisfied and happy in the company and
conver&s;ation of the man I loved; and when he
went into the country, contented my&s;elf with
his corre&s;pondence, which he punctually main|ta$ned,
in a &s;eries of letters equally, &s;en&s;ible, &s;in|ce$e
and affectionate.</P>
<P>Upon his return to town for the remainder of
the &s;ea&s;on, he devoted the greate&s;t part of his
time to our mutual enjoyment; left me with re|luctance,
when he was called away by indi&s;pen|&s;ible
bu&s;ine&s;s, and the civility which was due to his
acquaintance, and very &s;eldom went to any place of
publick ent$rtainment, becau&s;e I could not accom|pany
and &s;hare with him in the diver&s;ion: nay,
<PB N="225" REF="230">
&s;o much did I ingro&s;s his attention, that one even|ing,
after he had been teized into an agreement
of meeting &s;ome friends at a play, he went thi|ther
preci&s;ely at the appointed hour, and as they
did not arrive punctually at the very minute, he re|turned
to me immediately, as much rejoiced at his
e&s;cape as if he had met with &s;ome &s;ignal deliverance.
Nor was his con&s;tancy inferior to the ardour of
his love: we went once together to a ball in the
Hay-market, where, in the mid&s;t of a thou&s;and
fine women, who&s;e charms were inhanced by the
peculiarity of the dre&s;&s;es they wore, he remained
unthaken, un&s;educed, pre&s;erving his attachment
for me, in &s;pite of all temptation.</P>
<P>In the &s;ummer he provided me with a hou&s;e in
the neighbourhood of his own; but the accom|modations
being bad, and that country affording
no other place fit for my re&s;idence, he brought
me home to his own &s;eat, and by that &s;tep rai&s;ed
an univer&s;al clamour, tho' I &s;aw no company,
and led &s;uch a &s;olitary life, that nothing but ex|ce&s;&s;ive
love could have &s;upported my &s;pirits: not
but that he gave me as much of his time as he
could po&s;&s;ibly &s;pare from the nece&s;&s;ary duties of
paying and receiving vi&s;its, together with the
avocations of hunting, and other country amu&s;e|ments,
which I could not partake. Formerly,
indeed, I u&s;ed to hunt and &s;hoot, but I had left
off both; &s;o that I was now reduced to the alter|native
of reading and walking by my&s;elf: but,
<HI>Love made up for all deficiencies to me, who think
nothing el&s;e worth the living for!&mdash;Had I been
$word$ with a partner for l$fe, who could have
$word$ &s;incerely, and in&s;pired me with a mutual
$$$me, I would have a&s;ked no more of fate. Inte|re&s;t
and ambition have no &s;hare in my compo&s;ition;
<PB N="226" REF="231">
love which is plea&s;ure, or plea&s;ure which is love,
makes up the whole. A heart &s;o di&s;po&s;ed cannot be
devoid of other good qualities; it mu&s;t be &s;ubject to
the impre&s;&s;ions of humanity and benevolence, and
enemy to nothing but it&s;elf.</HI> This you will give me
leave to affirm, in ju&s;tice to my&s;elf, as I have
frankly owned my failings and mi&s;conduct.</P>
<P>Towards the end of &s;ummer my heart was a
little alarmed by a report that prevailed, of my
lover's being actually engaged in a treaty of mar|riage:
however, I gave little credit to this ru|mour,
till I was obliged to go to town about
bu&s;ine&s;s, and there I heard the &s;ame information
confidently affirmed. Tho' I &s;till con&s;idered it
as a vague &s;urmi&s;e, I wrote to him an account of
what I had heard; and in his an&s;wer, which is
&s;till in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he a&s;&s;ured me, with re|peated
vows and prote&s;tations, that the report
was altogether fal&s;e. Satisfied with this declara|tion,
I returned to his hou&s;e; and tho' the tale
was ince&s;&s;antly thundered in my ears, &s;till be|lieved
it void of all foundation, till my &s;u&s;picion
was awaked by a very incon&s;iderable circum|&s;tance.</P>
<P>One day, on his return from hunting, I per|ceived
he had a very fine pair of Dre&s;den ruffles
on his &s;hirt, which I could not &s;uppo&s;e he would
wear at &s;uch a ru&s;tic exerci&s;e; and therefore my
fears immediately took the alarm. When I
que&s;tioned him about this particular of his dre&s;s,
his colour changed; and tho' he attempted to
$lude my &s;u&s;picion, by imputing it to a mi&s;take
of his &s;ervant, I could not re&s;t &s;atisfied with this
account of the matter, but inquired into the
truth with &s;uch eagerne&s;s and penetration, that
he could not deny he had been to make a vi&s;it;
<PB N="227" REF="232">
and, by degrees, I even extorted from him a con|fe&s;&s;ion,
that he had engaged him&s;elf farther than
he ought to have proceeded, without making me
acquainted with his de&s;ign, tho' he endeavoured
to excu&s;e his conduct, and pacify my di&s;plea&s;ure,
by &s;aying that the affair would not be brought to
bear for a great while, and perhaps might never
come to a determination: but he was in great
confu&s;ion, and indeed hardly knew what he
&s;aid.</P>
<P>I would have quitted his hou&s;e that moment,
had not he, before-hand, obtained a promi&s;e that
I would take no ra&s;h re&s;olution of that kind, and
put it out of my power to procure any method of
conveyance by which I could make my retreat.
I gave no vent to reproaches, and only upbraid|ed
him with his having permitted me to return
in ignorance to the country, after I was once
fairly gone: upon which he &s;wore that he could
not bear the thoughts of parting with me. This
declaration was a my&s;tery at that time, but I
have been &s;ince &s;o fully &s;atisfied of his rea&s;ons
for his conduct, that I heartily acquit him of all
inju&s;tice to me. And indeed, it is my &s;incere
opinion, that if ever young man de&s;erved to be
happy, he is certainly intitled to that privi|lege;
and, if I may be allowed to judge, has
an heart &s;u&s;ceptible of the mo&s;t refined enjoy|ment.</P>
<P>The violence of the grief and con&s;ternation
which I &s;uffered from this &s;troke, having a little
&s;ub&s;ided, I deliberated with my&s;elf about the
mea&s;ures I &s;hould take, and determined to leave
$word$ hou&s;e &s;ome day when he &s;hould be abroad. I
<PB N="228" REF="233">
was encouraged in this re&s;olution by the advice of
our Scotch friend, who came about this time
from London, on a vi&s;it to his fellow-traveller:
we thought &s;uch an abrupt departure would be
le&s;s &s;hocking than to &s;tay and take a formal leave
of my lover, who&s;e heart was of &s;uch a delicate
frame, that after I told him I &s;hould one day
withdraw my&s;elf, in his ab&s;ence, he never came
home from the chace, or any other avocation,
without trembling with apprehen&s;ion that I had
e&s;caped.</P>
<P>After he had been &s;ome time accu&s;tomed to
the&s;e fears by my previous intimation, I at length
decamped, in good earne&s;t, tho' my heart aked
upon the occa&s;ion, becau&s;e I left him loving and
beloved; for his affection was evident, notwith|&s;tanding
the &s;tep he had taken, by the advice and
importunity of all his relations, who laid a di&s;|agreeable
re&s;traint upon his inclinations, while
they con&s;ulted his intere&s;t in every other parti|cular.</P>
<P>While I halted in the next great town, until
I could be &s;upplied with fre&s;h hor&s;es, I was vi&s;ited
by a gentleman who had been formerly intimate
with my lover; but a breach had happened in
their friend&s;hip, and he now came to complain
of the treatment he had received. Perceiving
that I was not in a humour to li&s;ten to his &s;tory,
he &s;hifted the conver&s;ation to my own, and ob|&s;erved,
that I had been extremely ill u&s;ed. I
told him I was of a different opinion: that it
was not only ju&s;t, but expedient, that a young
man of Mr.&mdash;'s fortune &s;hould think of
making &s;ome alliance to &s;trengthen and &s;upport
<PB N="229" REF="234">
the intere&s;t of his family; and that I had no|thing
to accu&s;e him of but his letting me remain
&s;o long in ignorance of his intention. He then
gave me to under&s;tand, that I was &s;till ignorant
of a great part of the ill u&s;age I had received, af|firming,
that while I lived in his hou&s;e, he had
amu&s;ed him&s;elf with all the common women in
that town, to &s;ome of whom this gentleman
had per&s;onally introduced him.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, I could not believe this imputation;
but he &s;upported his a&s;&s;ertions with &s;o many con|vincing
circum&s;tances, that I could no longer
doubt the truth of them; and I felt &s;o much re|&s;entment,
that my love vani&s;hed immediately
into air. In&s;tead of proceeding in my journey to
London, I went back a con&s;iderable way, and
&s;ent a me&s;&s;age, de&s;iring to &s;ee him in a little
hou&s;e, about mid way between his own habita|tion
and the town from whence I came. He
obeyed my &s;ummons, and appeared at the place
appointed, where I reproached him with great
bitterne&s;s. He pleaded guilty to the charge, &s;o
far as acknowledging that he had corre&s;ponded
with other women lately, in order to get the bet|ter
of his affection for me, but the experiment
had failed, and he found that he &s;hould be for
ever mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>I did not look upon this candid confe&s;&s;ion as a
&s;ufficient atonement for his pa&s;t di&s;&s;imulation,
and, in the &s;harpne&s;s of my revenge, demanded
a &s;ettlement, which he peremptorily refu&s;ed; &s;o
that, for the pre&s;ent, we held each other in the
utmo&s;t contempt. Indeed, I afterwards de&s;pi&s;ed
my&s;elf for my conde&s;cen&s;ion, which was owing
to the advice of my companion, &s;upported and
inflamed by the &s;pirit of re&s;entment. Neverthe|le&s;s,
<PB N="230" REF="235">
he begged that I would return to his hou&s;e,
or &s;tay all night where I was; but I was deaf to
his intreaties, and, after a great deal of ironi|cal
civility on my &s;ide, I took my leave, and
went away; yet, before I &s;et out, I looked back,
and &s;aw him on hor&s;eback, with &s;uch an air of
&s;implicity and truth, as called up a profound &s;igh,
notwith&s;tanding all that had pa&s;&s;ed in our con|ver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Upon my arrival in London, I took lodgings
in Leice&s;ter-Fields, and an&s;wered a letter which
I had &s;ome months before received from my lord;
telling him, that I would go home to him, with|out
&s;tipulating for any terms, to try what effect
my confidence would have upon his genero&s;ity.
He readily embraced the offer, and took an hou&s;e
in St. James's &s;treet, where I propo&s;ed to com|ply
with his humour in every thing that was
con&s;i&s;tent with my own peace and tranquil|lity.</P>
<P>Mean while, my lover pa&s;&s;ed his time very
di&s;agreeably in the country, with his friend, of
whom (it &s;eems) he had conceived &s;ome jealou&s;y,
which was increa&s;ed by a letter I wrote to that
gentleman, till he was made acquainted with the
contents, which he read over forty times; and
then his pa&s;&s;ion breaking out with more violence
than ever, he not only expre&s;&s;ed his feeling, in
an epi&s;tle which I immediately received, but
when he came to town, &s;uffered &s;uch agonies of
de&s;pair as I had never &s;een before, except in lord
B&mdash;. It was then in my power to have taken
ample revenge upon him, as well as upon my
in&s;olent rival, who had in&s;i&s;ted upon my leaving
his hou&s;e, in a very abrupt manner, tho' he ab|&s;olutely
refu&s;ed to gratify her malice; for he was
<PB N="231" REF="236">
now di&s;po&s;ed to do any thing for my &s;atisfaction:
but I knew his worth, and had too much regard
for his reputation to advi&s;e him to act incon|&s;i&s;tent
with his honour.</P>
<P>About this time, many tender meetings and
&s;orrowful partings happened between us, till the
marriage-knot was tied, when he &s;ent me a
bank-note for a thou&s;and pounds, by way of &s;pe|cimen
(as he called it) of his friend&s;hip, and of
what he would do for me, &s;hould I ever want
his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. This mark of his genero&s;ity I re|ceived
in a mo&s;t tender billet, which I &s;hall never
part with, together with his picture &s;et in dia|monds.</P>
<P>I now employed my thoughts in keeping mea|&s;ures
with my lord; we lay in the &s;ame apart|ment,
and for the fir&s;t four or five months I nei|ther
dined nor &s;upped abroad, above twice; and
then he knew where I was, and approved of my
company. But all this complacency and cir|cum&s;pection
had no effect upon his temper,
which remained as capricious and di&s;&s;ati&s;fied as
ever. Nay, to &s;uch a provoking degree did this
unhappy humour prevail, that one day, in the
pre&s;ence of his lawyer, he harrangued upon my
mi&s;conduct &s;ince our la&s;t re-union; and very
freely affirmed, that every &s;tep I had taken was
diametrically oppo&s;ite to his will.</P>
<P>Con&s;cious of the pains I had been at to plea&s;e
him, I was &s;o incen&s;ed at the&s;e unju&s;t invectives,
that &s;tarting up, I told him he was a little dirty
fellow; and would have left the hou&s;e imme|d$ately,
had not his lawyer, and others who
were in the next room, interpo&s;ed, and by dint
of argument and importunity diverted me from
my purpo&s;e. By the bye, I have been informed
<PB N="232" REF="237">
by a per&s;on of rank, that my lord di&s;covered ex|actly
the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition in his father's life-time,
and only changes the &s;ubject of his complaint
from the word <HI>father</HI> to that of <HI>wife.</HI> Indeed
he takes all opportunities of plaguing my dear
parent, as he has ju&s;t &s;agacity enough to know,
that this is the mo&s;t effectual way he can take
to di&s;tre&s;s me.</P>
<P>After repeated trials, I have given up all hopes
of making him happy, or of finding my&s;elf ea&s;y
in my &s;ituation; and live with him at pre&s;ent to
avoid a greater inconvenience. Not that his ill|nature
is all the grievance of which I complain:
exclu&s;ive of the per&s;onal di&s;gu&s;t I entertain for
him, his folly is of that &s;pecies which di&s;obliges
rather than diverts, and his vanity and affecta|tion
altogether intolerable; for he actually be|lieves
him&s;elf, or at lea&s;t would impo&s;e him&s;elf
upon mankind, as a pattern in gallantry and
ta&s;te; and, in point of bu&s;ine&s;s, a per&s;on of in|finite
&s;agacity and penetration: but the mo&s;t ri|diculous
part of his character is his pretended ta|lent
for politics, in which he &s;o deeply concerns
him&s;elf, that he has di&s;mi&s;&s;ed many a good &s;er|vant,
becau&s;e he &s;u&s;pected him of having wrong
connexions; a theme upon which he has often
quarrelled with me, even almo&s;t to parting, ac|cu&s;ing
me of holding corre&s;pondence with the
earls of B&mdash;and C&mdash;, and Mr. H&mdash;V&mdash;tho' I
never had the lea&s;t acquaintance with any of the&s;e
gentlemen, except the earl of C&mdash;, to whom I
have not &s;poke for the&s;e ten years pa&s;t.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I have often been at a lo&s;s to know,
whether he was more mad or malicious in tho&s;e
&s;its of enthu&s;ia&s;m, wherein he &s;eemed tran&s;port|ed
with zeal for the commonwealth, and tor|mented
<PB N="233" REF="238">
me with his admonitions, out of all
temper and patience. At length, however, I
contrived an expedient which freed me from
the&s;e trouble&s;ome expo&s;tulations, and &s;ilenced
him effectually on the &s;core of politicks. This
was no other than an open avowal of being con|nected
with all tho&s;e people whom I have nam|ed.
Indeed, I knew him too well to believe
there was any thing &s;olid in his intention or pro|fe&s;&s;ions,
even when he carried them &s;o far as to
demand a private audience of the K&mdash;, in order
to communicate a &s;cheme for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the re|bellion;
and that being denied, &s;ollicited the
duke of D&mdash;'s intere&s;t, for permi&s;&s;ion to rai&s;e
and head a regiment of Kenti&s;h &s;mugglers: nay,
to &s;uch a pitch did his loyalty &s;oar, that he pur|cha&s;ed
a firelock of particular mechani&s;m, cal|culated
for the &s;afety of the bearer, in ca&s;e he
had been placed centinel at his maje&s;ty's door;
and kept his hor&s;es ready capari&s;oned, with a
view of attending his &s;overeign to the field. Not|with&s;tanding
all the&s;e pompous preparations, had
he been put to the proof, he would have in&s;al|libly
crept out of his engagements, thro' &s;ome
&s;neaking eva&s;ion, his imagination being very fer|tile
in &s;uch &s;aving pretences. Yet he will talk
&s;ometimes &s;o &s;ervently, and even &s;en&s;ibly, on
the &s;ubject, that a &s;tranger would mi&s;take him
for a man of under&s;tanding, and determined zeal
for the good of his country.</P>
<P>Since my la&s;t return to his hou&s;e, that act of
parliament pa&s;&s;ed, by which he was enabled to
pay his debts, and among the re&s;t, a thou&s;and
pounds of my contracting, the only burden of
that kind I ever intailed upon him, exclu&s;ive of
my pin-money, which was never regularly paid;
<PB N="234" REF="239">
nor would he have been &s;ubject to this, had he
not, by his per&s;ecution and pur&s;uit, expo&s;ed me
to an extraordinary expence. I have al&s;o had it
in my power to reward &s;ome of my faithful Abi|gails;
in particular, to relieve from extreme di|&s;tre&s;s
that maid to whom (as I have already ob|&s;erved)
lord B&mdash;granted an annuity, which &s;he
had &s;old: &s;o that &s;he was reduced to the mo&s;t
$bject poverty, and I found her in a di&s;mal hole,
with two infants, peri&s;hing for want; a &s;pectacle
which drew tears from my eyes, and indeed
could not but make a deep impre&s;&s;ion upon an
heart like mine, which the mi&s;ery of my fellow-creatures
never failed to melt.</P>
<P>Nor did I, upon this occa&s;ion, forget the at|tachment
and fidelity of my other woman Mrs.
S&mdash;, who hearing I was robbed in my pa&s;&s;age
thro' Flanders, had generou&s;ly relinqui&s;hed the
allowance I had &s;ettled upon her at parting. The
exerci&s;e of &s;uch acts of humanity and benevo|lence,
and the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing my dear and
tender parent often, in &s;ome mea&s;ure alleviate
the chagrin to which I am &s;ubject, from the di&s;|agreeable
di&s;po&s;ition of my lord, who, con&s;i&s;tent
with his former incon&s;i&s;tency, upon our la&s;t re|conciliation
chearfully agreed to a propo&s;al I
made of having concerts in the hou&s;e, and even
approved of the &s;cheme with marks of particular
&s;atisfaction: but before one half of the winter
was expired, he found means to bani&s;h all the
company, beginning with lord R&mdash;B&mdash;, who,
as he walked up &s;tairs one evening, was &s;topped
by a &s;ootman, who plainly told him he had or|ders
to &s;ay to him in particular, that his lord&s;hip
was not at home: yet the very next day perceiv|ing
that nobleman and me walking together in
the park, he joined us with an air of alacrity, as
<PB N="235" REF="240">
if no &s;uch thing had happened, and even be|haved
to lord R&mdash;with the mo&s;t &s;awning
complai&s;ance. His deportment was equally ab|&s;urd
and impertinent to the re&s;t of our friends,
who for&s;ook us gradually, being tired of main|taining
any friendly communication with &s;uch a
di&s;agreeable compo&s;ition of ignorance and arro|gance.
For my own part, I look upon him as
utterly incorrigible; and as fate hath &s;ubjected
me to his power, endeavour to make the bitter
draught go down, by detaching my&s;elf, as much
as po&s;&s;ible, from the &s;uppo&s;ition that there is any
&s;uch exi&s;tence upon earth. Indeed, if I had not
fatal experience of the contrary, I &s;hould be apt
to believe that &s;uch a character is not to be found
among the &s;ons of men; becau&s;e his conduct is
altogether unaccountable by the known rules
and maxims of life, and falls intirely under the
poet's ob&s;ervation, when he &s;ays.</P>
<LG>
<L>Tis true, no meaning puzzles more than wit.</L>
</LG>
<P>Her lady&s;hip having thus concluded her &s;tory,
to the entertainment of the company, and the
admiration of Peregrine, who expre&s;&s;ed his a&s;to|ni&s;hment
at the variety of adventure &s;he had un|dergone,
which was &s;uch as he thou$ht &s;ufficient
to de&s;troy the mo&s;t hardy and robu&s;t con&s;titution,
and therefore infinitely more than enough to
overwhelm one of her delicate frame; one of the
gentlemen pre&s;ent, roundly taxed her with want
of candour, in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing &s;ome circum&s;tances of
her life, which he thought e&s;&s;ential in the con&s;i|deration
of her character.</P>
<P>She reddened at this peremptory charge, which
had an evident effect upon the countenances of
the whole audience, when the accu&s;er proceeded
<PB N="236" REF="241">
to explain his imputation, by ob&s;erving, that, in
the cour&s;e of her narration, &s;he had omitted to
mention a thou&s;and acts of uncommon charity,
of which he him&s;elf knew her to b$ guilty; that
she had concealed a great many advantageous
propo&s;als of marriage, which &s;he might have
accepted, before &s;he was engaged; that &s;he
had not &s;poke one word of her fir&s;t hu&s;band's
debts, which, to his certain knowledge, &s;he had
paid out of her own privy pur&s;e, after her &s;econd
marriage, and on that account received the
thanks of lord W&mdash;'s elder brother, who,
though he had undertaken to di&s;charge them, de|layed
the execution of his purpo&s;e longer than
&s;he thought they &s;hould remain unpaid: and that,
in relating her inducements for leaving Mr. S&mdash;,
(whether out of forgetfulne&s;s, or from tender|ne&s;s
to a lover once &s;o dear to her, he would not
pretend to &s;ay) &s;he had omitted a very cogent
motive for her own conduct; for as he had fir&s;t
courted her favour in her ri&s;ing fortune, and left
her in its decline, &s;he could not avoid reflecting,
that, after this precipitate re-engagement, when
the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of their meeting were over,
he would again act the &s;ame conduct, as &s;oon as
her tranquillity &s;hould be di&s;turbed by the per&s;e|cution
of her lord.</P>
<P>The company were agreeably undeceived by
this explanation; which her lady&s;hip acknow|ledged
in very polite terms, as a compliment
equally genteel and unexpected: and our hero,
after having te&s;tified the &s;en&s;e he had of her
$omplai&s;ance and conde&s;cen&s;ion, in regaling him
with &s;uch a mark of her confidence and e&s;teem,
took his leave, and went home in a &s;tate of
confu&s;ion and perplexity; for, from the cir|cum&s;tances
of the tale he had heard, he plainly
<PB N="237" REF="242">
perceived, that her lady&s;hip's heart was too de|licate
to receive &s;uch incen&s;e, as he, in the ca|pacity
of an admirer, could at pre&s;ent pay; be|cau&s;e,
though he had in &s;ome mea&s;ure abridged
the empire of Emilia in his own brea&s;t, it was
not in his power to re&s;train it &s;o effectually, but
that it would interfere with any other &s;overeign
whom his thoughts &s;hould adopt: and, unle&s;s
lady&mdash;could ingro&s;s his whole love, time
and attention, he fore&s;aw, that it would be
impo&s;&s;ible for him to &s;upport the pa&s;&s;ion which
he might have the good fortune to in&s;pire. He
was, moreover, deterred from declaring his love,
by the fate of her former admirers, who &s;eemed
to have been wound up to a degree of enthu|&s;ia&s;m,
that looked more like the effect of in|chantment,
than the in&s;piration of human at|tractions;
an exta&s;y of pa&s;&s;ion which he dur&s;t
not venture to undergo; therefore re&s;olved to
combat with the impre&s;&s;ions he had already re|ceived,
and, if po&s;&s;ible, cultivate her friend&s;hip
without &s;oliciting her affection: but, before he
could fix upon this determination, he de&s;ired to
know the predicament in which he &s;tood in her
opinion; and by the intelligence of Crabtree, ob|tained
in the u&s;ual manner, under&s;tood that her
&s;entiments of him were very favourable, though
without the lea&s;t tincture of love. He would have
been tran&s;ported with joy, had her thoughts of
him been of a more tender texture; though his
rea&s;on was better plea&s;ed with the information he
received; in con&s;equence of which, he mu&s;tered
up the ideas of his fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;et them in
oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e of this new and dangerous at|tachment;
by which means, he kept the balance
<HI>in equilibrio,</HI> and his bo&s;om tolerably quiet.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LXXXIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine amu&s;es his imagination, by &s;light incur|&s;ions
upon the territory of vice and folly; reforms
a back-&s;liding brother, and &s;ends a celebrated
&s;harper into exile.</HEAD>
<P>HIS heart being thus, as it were, &s;u&s;pended
between two objects that le&s;&s;ened the force
of each other's attraction, he took this op|portunity
of enjoying &s;ome re&s;pite, and for the
pre&s;ent detached his &s;entiments from both; re|&s;olving
to indulge him&s;elf in the exerci&s;e of that
practical &s;ative, which was &s;o agreeable and pe|culiar
to his di&s;po&s;ition. In this laudable determi|nation
he was confirmed by the repeated &s;ugge|&s;tions
of his friend Cadwallader, who taxed him
with letting his talents ru&s;t in indolence, and &s;ti|mulated
his natural vivacity, with a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
fre&s;h di&s;coveries in the world of &s;candal.</P>
<P>Thus reinforced, they took the field, and per|formed
various exploits, to the mortification,
a&s;toni&s;hment and di&s;may of all tho&s;e coxcombs,
whether male or female, &s;ierce or feeble, in&s;olent
or tame, that hang like tatters on the &s;kirts of
gallantry, and bring the fa&s;hion into di&s;grace.
As I might tre&s;pa&s;s upon the patience of the rea|der,
in giving a minute det$$l of each adventure
of this kind which they atchieved, I &s;hall content
my&s;elf with relating two only, to which indeed
all the re&s;t bore &s;$me re&s;emblance.</P>
<P>Peregrine's intelligencer, who (as we have al|ready
ob&s;erved) was a privileged per&s;on in all
parties, happened one morning to breakfa&s;t with
a fort of a great man, who, with a large &s;tock
<PB N="239" REF="244">
of timorous &s;uper&s;tition and exterior piety, had
at bottom a &s;pice of carnality, which all his re|ligion
could not extingui&s;h. Among the re&s;t of
his dependants, there was a certain favourite,
who by the mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous attention to his hu|mour,
in a cour&s;e of artful flattery and &s;ervile
complai&s;ance, had in&s;inuated him&s;elf &s;o far into
his confidence and e&s;teem, that he now acted in
the capacity of his coun&s;ellor and director, both
in his &s;piritual and temporal concerns.</P>
<P>This cunning para&s;ite having di&s;covered his
patron's infirmity, began to be afraid, that in the
in&s;tigations of the fle&s;h, he might be tempted to
employ &s;ome other agent for the gratification of
his appetite: and fore&s;eeing that any mini&s;ter of
this kind would infallibly prove a dangerous rival
to him, in the good graces of his ma&s;ter, he re|&s;olved
to anticipate the misfortune, and, with his
other offices, monopolize the functions of a Mer|cury,
for which his talents were perfectly well
adapted. But this was not the whole of his ta&s;k;
he knew there were certain qualms and &s;cruples
of con&s;cience to be removed, as well as other
motives of &s;hyne&s;s and di&s;tru&s;t, which he dur&s;t
not leave to the operation of his friend's own de|&s;ires,
le&s;t he &s;hould choo&s;e &s;ome other confident;
he therefore ob&s;erved the different &s;ea&s;ons of his
con&s;titution, and culled the proper opportunities
of expre&s;&s;ing a relaxation in his &s;entiments of cha|&s;tity;
which being gratefully received, he pro|ceeded
in the work of conver&s;ion, already half
effected by his patron's own pa&s;&s;ions; and in
conclu&s;ion, &s;ound a willing dame to quench this
fire that &s;corched his vitals. He had overnight
obtained her con&s;ent, and the particulars of their
meeting were adju&s;ted, in pre&s;ence of Cadwal|lader,
<PB N="240" REF="245">
who gave his a&s;&s;ociate to under&s;tand that,
with a view of keeping the rendezvous &s;ecret
and my&s;terious, as well as of &s;aving the lovers
that mutual confu&s;ion which the light mu&s;t have
produced, the &s;cene of their interview was laid
in a &s;ummer-hou&s;e, that &s;tood at the end of his
garden, to which the lady and her conductor
would be admitted in the dark, through a back-door
that &s;hould be left open for the purpo&s;e.
Peregrine being made acquainted with the&s;e par|ticulars,
together with the hour of a&s;&s;ignation,
ordered Pipes to purcha&s;e a live calf, and carried
it in a &s;ack, about the twilight, to the back|garden-door,
which our hero entered without he|&s;itation,
di&s;po&s;ing him&s;elf and his attendants in a
dark alcove immediately under the &s;ummer-hou&s;e,
where (without di&s;engaging the animal from its
covering) he be&s;meared its front with liquid
pho&s;phorus, and directed Tom to unveil, and
pre&s;ent it to the company at their approach,
while he him&s;elf ab&s;conded behind a pillar, from
whence he could view the entertainment. They
had continued a whole hour in this &s;ituation,
when they perceived by &s;tar-light, three per&s;ons
enter the po&s;tern, and advance towards the place
where they lay; upon which, Pipes began to di&s;|entangle
his charge, that he might be ready to
play it off at the proper time; but, as he was not
very expert in this bu&s;ine&s;s, the calf finding it&s;elf
di&s;engaged from its confinement, &s;prung all of a
&s;udden out of his hands, and running directly for|wards,
encountered tho&s;e that approached, and
as it pa&s;&s;ed them, uttered a loud <HI>Baa.</HI></P>
<P>The gallant, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions were exalted to a
pitch of enthu&s;ia&s;m, as &s;u&s;ceptible of religious
horror as of love, &s;eeing &s;uch an apparition, when
<PB N="241" REF="246">
he was at the point of indulging a criminal appe|tite,
and hearing the dreadful cry, accompanied
with the terrible word <HI>damnation,</HI> which Pipes,
in his peculiar tone, exclaimed from the alcove,
when the animal made its e&s;cape; he was &s;eized
with con&s;ternation and remor&s;e, and falling upon
his face, lay in all the agonies of terror, believing
him&s;elf warned by a particular me&s;&s;age from
above. His tru&s;ty &s;quire, who was not quite &s;o
vi&s;ionary, recollecting him&s;elf from the &s;urprize
he had &s;uffered at the fir&s;t appearance of &s;uch a
glaring phaenomenon, which had al&s;o &s;uch an ef|fect
upon the lady, that &s;he ran out into the
fields, &s;creaming all the way: I &s;ay, he no &s;ooner
recovered the faculty of reflection, which this ac|cident
had for &s;ome minutes taken away, than
he ob&s;erved his patron's pro&s;tration; and gue&s;&s;ing
the condition of his thoughts, re&s;olved to profit
by his &s;agacity. He accordingly laid him&s;elf
gently down upon the cold walk, and lay very
quietly, till the lover, having in a faultring voice
called thrice upon his name, without being fa|voured
with an an&s;wer, rai&s;ed him&s;elf up, and
coming to the &s;pot, &s;hook him by the arm; upon
which he &s;eemed to wake from his trance, and in
a mo&s;t penitent tone pronounced a very pious
ejaculation, which confirmed the opinion of his
principal, who a&s;ked him with fear and trembling,
if he had heard the voice and &s;een the light. Be|ing
an excellent actor, he replied with all the
marks of amazement, that he was &s;truck blind
with a gu&s;h of light, far exceeding that of the
&s;un at noon, and his ears appalled with a voice,
like the found of many waters, denouncing dam|nation
to tho&s;e who obey the lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="247">
The converted lover, though he was not &s;en|&s;ible
of &s;uch extraordinary circum&s;tances of vi&s;i|tation,
implicitely believed every tittle of his ac|count,
imputing the difference of his own per|ception
to the weakne&s;s of his organs, which
were &s;ooner di&s;turbed than tho&s;e of his purveyor.
He therefore propo&s;ed, that they &s;hould adjourn
to the chamber which had been de&s;tined for the
&s;cene of his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and with &s;orrow and
contrition a&s;k pardon of heaven for his intended
offence, acknowledging at the &s;ame time, the
&s;ea&s;onable and &s;alutary interpo&s;ition of providence.
This duty was accordingly performed, after they
had &s;earched in vain for the nymph, who (the
&s;quire &s;eemed to think) was conveyed by &s;ome &s;u|pernatural
means from the garden; for he &s;aid,
as he lay intranced upon the ground, he heard a
rattling like the chariots of Aminadab, and the
&s;hrieks of the young woman gradually &s;inking in
a di&s;tant cadence, as if &s;he had been tran&s;ported
through the air.</P>
<P>As this pair of penitents walked up &s;tairs to
the &s;ummer-hou&s;e, the patron, in an exta&s;y
of faith, pronounced, &startq;After this tremen|dous
&s;cene, who can be &s;o incredulous, &s;o
dead to all conviction, as to doubt the miracle
of the loaves and fi&s;hes, or the amazing cir|cum&s;tances
that attended the conver&s;ion of St.
Paul?&endq; While they were employed in the ex|erci&s;e
of their devotion, our hero and his atten|dant
retired by the back-door, which opened in|to
the fields; and while Pipes went in pur&s;uit of
his calf, which had taken &s;helter under the wall,
his ma&s;ter proceeded forwards to the place from
whence he had come, where he had agreed to
meet Cadwallader, and communicate the &s;ucce&s;s
<PB N="243" REF="248">
of his enterprize, with which he was perfectly
well plea&s;ed. In cro&s;&s;ing the field that lay be|twixt
him and that part of the town for which
he was bound, he chanced to pa&s;s by a heap of
wood, upon which he perceived a woman, tole|rably
well dre&s;&s;ed, sitting, and holding a &s;mel|ling-bottle
to her no&s;e. He immediately gue&s;&s;ed
her to be the lady whom he had interrupted in
her a&s;&s;ignation; and thinking it was incumbent
upon him to make &s;ome atonement for the in|jury
he had done, he acco&s;ted her with great po|litene&s;s
and re&s;pect, telling her, he pre&s;umed,
from her being in &s;uch a &s;olitary place, at &s;uch an
hour, that &s;he had met with &s;ome mi&s;fortune;
and that, if &s;he would put her&s;elf under his pro|tection,
he would defend her from any farther
in&s;ult.</P>
<P>His conjecture was right; this was the indi|vidual
inamorata who had fled from the garden,
and who was &s;o terrified at the vi&s;ion, the mean|ing
of which &s;he could not comprehend, that
&s;he found her&s;elf unable to proceed farther home|wards,
and &s;at down on a log of wood, to enjoy
a little pau&s;e of re&s;t, and endeavour to recollect
her di&s;&s;ipated &s;pirits. She had not yet got the
better of her apprehen&s;ion, which was rather in|crea&s;ed
by the darkne&s;s of the night and the lone|line&s;s
of the place; &s;o that &s;he, without &s;cruple,
emb$aced the offer of a per&s;on who behaved with
&s;$ch gentle addre&s;s: and as &s;he was enervated by
f$ar, &s;he carefully &s;upported her in walking, with
his arm round her wai&s;t, encouraging her all the
way with a&s;&s;urances of &s;afety, and expre&s;&s;ing his
curio&s;ity to know the adventure, in con&s;equence
of which &s;he had occa&s;ion for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. She
&s;poke very little during her pa&s;&s;age through the
<PB N="244" REF="249">
field, becau&s;e, notwith&s;tanding his profe&s;&s;ions and
appearance, he was &s;till a &s;tranger; and therefore
&s;he could not be altogether ea&s;y, while &s;he
thought her&s;elf ab&s;olutely in his power: but,
when they entered the town, and mingled with
the concour&s;e of people that pa&s;s and repa&s;s
through all the &s;treets of this metropolis, her dif|fidence
intirely vani&s;hed, and her conver&s;ation
became altogether unre&s;erved.</P>
<P>The remembrance of what had di&s;compo&s;ed
her &s;o much in the garden, now afforded &s;ubject
for her mirth; and when her conductor &s;till re|peated
his de&s;ire of information, &s;he could not help
laughing heartily, at the circum&s;tances which his
que&s;tions recalled. Encouraged by this mani|fe&s;tation
of good humour, he ob&s;erved, that as
her &s;pirits were exhau&s;ted by the fatigue and di&s;|quite
&s;he had undergone, it would be impo&s;&s;ible
for her to walk much farther, and begg'd &s;he
would &s;tep with him into the next tavern, where
they might &s;end for an hackney-coach or chair,
in which &s;he would be conveyed to her own lodg|ing.
After much intreaty, &s;he con&s;ented to his
propo&s;al; and he had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee, that &s;he
was a very hand&s;ome young woman, about the
age of eighteen.</P>
<P>The joy he felt at this di&s;covery lightened in
his eyes; nor was &s;he able to conceal a certain
alacrity and &s;atisfaction that appeared in her
countenance, when &s;he obtained a di&s;tinct view
of her protector's per&s;on. In &s;hort, &s;he was pre|vailed
upon to drink a gla&s;s of wine; and Pere|grine
pre&s;uming upon his knowledge of her ad|venture,
began to make love with great vehe|mence.
At fir&s;t, &s;he pretended to take offence
at his pre&s;umption; but, perceiving from certain
<PB N="245" REF="250">
in&s;inuations which he artfully dropp'd, that he
was better acquainted with her character than
&s;he had imagined, her &s;hyne&s;s gradually wore off,
and they &s;oon came to a &s;atisfactory explanation;
in the beginning of which, he frankly unravelled
the whole my&s;tery of the apparition: a di&s;covery
which had almo&s;t proved fatal to her, from the
violence of mirth it produced; and &s;he as can|didly
di&s;clo&s;ed her own private hi&s;tory. She told
him, that her lover's honourable agent had for|merly
lived in the hou&s;e of her mother, who
being a poor widow, &s;upported her family by
letting lodgings; that he had, by the opportu|nities
of familiarity and friend&s;hip, employed
his arts upon her, and actually debauched
this girl, when &s;he was no more than fifteen years
of age; that upon the remon&s;trances of her mo|ther,
who detected their corre&s;pondence, by
perceiving &s;he was with child, he had quitted
the hou&s;e, with an ab&s;olute refu&s;al to provide for
her; &s;o that &s;he was obliged to &s;ue him for the
maintenance of the infant, and reduced to the
nece&s;&s;ity of receiving gallants in private; though
&s;he had always managed her occupation in &s;uch
a manner, as to pre&s;erve her character un&s;u&s;|pected
in the neighbourhood: and la&s;tly, that
her fir&s;t &s;educer had lately renewed his corre&s;pon|dence,
by dint of pre&s;ents and apologies, and
procured her as a virgin for his patron, who
had promi&s;ed to &s;ettle &s;ome &s;mall provi&s;ion upon
her for life.</P>
<P>Peregrine com$orted her for her di&s;appoint|ment,
by reciting what he had overheard of the
conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed in the garden, after &s;he
made her elopement; from whence he inferred,
that her intere&s;t would &s;uffer no prejudice from
<PB N="246" REF="251">
that interruption; becau&s;e, in all probability,
her intended lover's fle&s;h would &s;oon get the better
of the &s;pirit again, in &s;pite of a thou&s;and appa|ritions;
in which ca&s;e, he would again have re|cour&s;e
to her compliance; or, &s;hould his &s;uper|&s;tition
prevail, he would look upon him&s;elf as in
duty and con&s;cience bound, to enable her, by a
&s;uita ble &s;ettlement, to with&s;tand &s;uch temptations
for the future.</P>
<P>She &s;eemed to concur with his opinion, and
was perfectly &s;atisfied with that expectation,
while our hero was more and more engaged by
her ea&s;y and agreeable deportment. Her conver|&s;ation
was that of a gay libertine, who had a
good &s;hare of &s;en&s;e and imagination, which, with
a natural vivacity, &s;he employed in accommo|dating
her&s;elf to the humour of her gallant: but
his ears were not di&s;gu&s;ted with the nau&s;eous ri|baldry
and vulgar execrations which characteri&s;e
the di&s;cour&s;e of tho&s;e nymphs, who&s;e temporary
endearments are &s;olicited by the di&s;tingui&s;hing
youth of this refined age. In a word&punc; this acci|dental
meeting was productive of very agreeable
con&s;equences to both; and an intimacy of inter|cour&s;e
immediately commenced, the re&s;ult of
which was, her promi&s;ing to re&s;erve her favours
for him alone, till farther notice, and to enter
into no mea&s;ures with the vi&s;ionary, but &s;uch as
he &s;hould know and approve.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed the evening with this new ac|quaintance,
and informed him&s;elf of the particu|lars
nece&s;&s;ary to be known, for the &s;upport of the
corre&s;pondence they had e&s;tabli&s;hed, he favoured
her with &s;ome marks of his bounty, and repaired
to the lodgings of his friend Crabtree, who was
&s;o much incen&s;ed at his breach of punctuality,
<PB N="247" REF="252">
that he ordered him&s;elf to be denied; and when
the young gentleman forced his entrance into his
chamber, <HI>vi &amp; armis,</HI> would not open his mouth;
but a&s;&s;uming the mo&s;t grim contraction of his
countenance, &s;at in &s;ullen &s;ilence, till the circum|&s;tances
of the adventure, which his a&s;&s;ociate knew
how to relate to the greate&s;t advantage, gradually
unbended his features to an involuntary &s;mile,
which &s;oon dilated into an unre&s;trained laugh,
a&s;&s;uring Peregrine of his forgivene&s;s and appro|bation:
for though (as I have already ob&s;erved)
this Mi&s;anthrope had gained an ab&s;olute a&s;cen|dency
over the mu&s;cles of his face, and, when
under the eye of the world, could laugh inward|ly,
without betraying the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of mirth,
this &s;elf-denial was not exerted without pains;
and therefore he, in private, indemnified him&s;elf
for the trouble he was at, in pre&s;erving that in|flexible
gravity in public.</P>
<P>Next day in the evening, our adventurer vi|&s;ited
his fair Phillis, and under&s;tood that &s;he had
a me&s;&s;age from the new convert, exhorting her
to repentance and reformation, and promi&s;ing to
&s;upport her in her laudable endeavours, as &s;oon as
&s;he &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to begin the great work.
At the &s;ame time, his tru&s;ty me&s;&s;enger had talked
of his patron's conver&s;ion in the mo&s;t ludicrous
terms, accounted for the apparition, by affirm|ing,
that it was no other than a dog, with a
paper-lanthorn hanging to his neck, equipped in
that manner by &s;ome prentices for their diver&s;ion;
that he had been thrown over the wall, with a
view to frighten the &s;ervants of the family; and
not liking his quarters, no &s;ooner perceived the
garden-door opened, than he naturally ran to|wards
it, in order to make his e&s;cape. He like|wi&s;e
<PB N="248" REF="253">
frankly owned, that he had, with a view to
his own intere&s;t, encouraged his lord and ma&s;ter
in his &s;uper&s;titious fears, and even coun&s;elled him
to execute, in the cour&s;e of his penitence, a plan
which he had formerly laid, of commencing au|thor,
and e&s;pou&s;ing in print the cau&s;e of miracles,
again&s;t the children of perver&s;ene&s;s and incredu|lity:
and in conclu&s;ion, this faithful advi&s;er had
made &s;trong love on his own &s;core, propo&s;ing to
maintain a corre&s;pondence with her, for which
&s;he would be amply recompenced by the bounty
of his patron, whom he undertook to deceive
with a &s;eigned account of her repentance.</P>
<P>The wench, having an aver&s;ion to the cha|racter
of this para&s;ite, whom &s;he had too great
rea&s;on to know, in&s;tead of embracing his pro|po&s;al
with chearfulne&s;s and alacrity, told him
with an affected air of &s;everity, that how&s;oever
his heart might be hardened again&s;t the warnings
of heaven, &s;he had the internal comfort to find
her own brea&s;t touched with a due &s;en&s;e of her
unworthine&s;s, and would, by the ble&s;&s;ing of pro|vidence,
imitate the &s;alutary example of his good
friend, to whom &s;he intended to write an account
of her inward workings, which &s;he hoped were
no other than the motions of the &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Mr. Mercury hearing this unexpected decla|ration,
which was delivered with a face of pious
re&s;olution, immediately availed him&s;elf of that
hypocri&s;y, which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed to &s;uch a con&s;um|mate
degree; and after having prote&s;ted with
great earne&s;tne&s;s, that what he had &s;aid, was ut|tered
with a view to try whether or not &s;he was
intirely mortified to all the l$&s;ts of the fle&s;h, he
applauded her determination with the mo&s;t lofty
encomiums, and admoni&s;hed her to per&s;everance,
<PB N="249" REF="254">
in an enthu&s;ia&s;tic harangue; during which, the
tears actually gu&s;hed from his eyes, and his looks
adopted a &s;ort of wildne&s;s and extatic &s;tare, as if
he had been really tran&s;ported.</P>
<P>Though &s;he &s;aw through the di&s;gui&s;e, &s;he
&s;eemed convinced of his &s;incerity; as a confir|mation
of which, he gave her his pur&s;e, and
took his leave, a&s;&s;uring her that &s;he &s;hould never
want, &s;o long as &s;he could retain grace enough
to per&s;i&s;t in the happy work &s;he had &s;o righteou&s;ly
begun. Peregrine approved of her behaviour,
and having in&s;tructed her with regard to her fu|ture
conduct, returned to his auxiliary and intel|ligencer,
with whom he concerted another &s;tra|tagem,
to be practi&s;ed upon a certain &s;he-game&s;ter
of fa&s;hion, and a French adventurer, who, under
the title of count, &s;upported with invincible ef|frontery,
and a large &s;tock of &s;ine&s;&s;e, had found
means to introduce him&s;elf among the quality,
from many of whom he had extracted large &s;ums
of money at play. Among tho&s;e whom he laid
under contribution, was this lady, who with all
the inclination of a rank &s;harper, had fallen a &s;a|crifice
to his &s;uperior talents, and become his
debtor for five hundred pounds, which &s;he could
not pay without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her hu&s;band,
whom &s;he did not think proper to inform of the
lo&s;s. She had for &s;ome days evaded the demands
of her creditor, by divers &s;pecious pretences,
which, however, were &s;oon exhau&s;ted; and he
grew &s;o di&s;agreeably importunate, as to threaten
an application to her lord, if &s;he would not di&s;|charge
the debt immediately.</P>
<P>The lady being a latitudinarian in her prin|ciples,
and reduced to great perplexity by the&s;e
menaces, could think of no other expedient to
<PB N="250" REF="255">
extricate her&s;elf, than that of practi&s;ing upon
the foreigner's heart, which &s;he accordingly a&s;|&s;ailed
with all the arts of coquetry, reinforced
by a very agreeable per&s;on, to which &s;he had
been often indebted for &s;undry fortunate events.
Neverthele&s;s, in all probability &s;he would have
found the count impregnable, had not he, at
this cri&s;is, luckily met with &s;uch a flow of &s;uc|ce&s;s,
as elevated his fancy, and opened his heart
to amorous impre&s;&s;ions. In this &s;tate of exulta|tion
did he fir&s;t perceive, or at lea&s;t acknowledge
the attractions of his debtor, to whom he, in a
billet, declared his pa&s;&s;ion, and frankly propo&s;ed
the alternative, which it was her &s;ole aim to pro|cure.</P>
<P>After the nece&s;&s;ary &s;cruples of decent reluc|tance,
the affair was compromi&s;ed, in the hear|ing
of Cadwallader, who reported to his a&s;&s;o|ciate,
that &s;he had given the count an a&s;&s;ignation
at the hou&s;e of a di&s;creet matron, who, under
the denomination of a milliner, kept commo|dious
apartments for interviews of this kind.</P>
<P>Peregrine, who was not unknown to this
prie&s;te&s;s of love, no &s;ooner received this intelli|gence,
than he went and be&s;poke one of her
chambers, contiguous to that which the foreigner
had cho&s;en for his accommodation; and &s;ome
time before the hour of their appointment, took
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, accompanied by Crabtree, whom
he had dre&s;&s;ed in woman's apparel, becau&s;e the
Mi&s;anthrope would not run the ri&s;que of being
ob&s;erved <HI>in propria per&s;ona.</HI></P>
<P>The lovers, true to their contract, met pre|ci&s;ely
at the hour; the lady having di&s;gui&s;ed
her&s;elf in an ordinary di&s;habille, with a capuchin,
the hood of which effectually concealed her
<PB N="251" REF="256">
countenance; and the door of their apartment
being &s;hut, the count found him&s;elf on the brink
of enjoying his good fortune, when all of a &s;ud|den,
Peregrine, placing him&s;elf at the door, pro|nounced
aloud, in the very voice and manner of
her lord, whom he per&s;onally knew, &startq;Stand
firm upon your po&s;t, Mr. Con&s;table, and take
care that none &s;hall pa&s;s, while I break open the
door, and make &s;ure of the delinquent; for now
I think her lady&s;hip is fairly caught.&endq;</P>
<P>This exclamation produced an in&s;tantaneous
effect in the chamber: the count, terrified at the
pro&s;pect of immediate death or pro&s;ecution, ran
directly to the window, and throwing up the
&s;a&s;h, would have made his exit into the &s;treet,
without ceremony; but my lady, who never
doubted that her hu&s;band was at the door, had
recour&s;e to that pre&s;ence of mind, which never
for&s;ook her upon &s;uch occa&s;ions; and &s;eizing her
gallant by the collar, exalted her voice, crying,
&startq;Rape! Murder! Rape! Ah villain! do you
attempt my virtue? Are the&s;e the laces you in|vited
me to come and &s;ee? Ah, you bea&s;tly
mon&s;ter! Help, good people, help!&endq;</P>
<P>The noi&s;e of the&s;e outcries, (in con&s;equence
of which Pickle immediately retreated to his
den) alarmed the whole family. The landlady,
who&s;e reputation was at &s;take, ran up &s;tairs, ac|companied
by two chairmen, who waited for
my lady below; and the door being bur&s;t open
by her directions, they found her lady&s;hip in a
violent agitation, holding fa&s;t by the count, who
&s;tood without his perriwig, &s;haking from head
to foot, in all the agony of horror and di&s;may&punc;
My lady, finding her&s;elf delivered from the at|tempts
of this ravi&s;her, &s;unk down upon the
<PB N="252" REF="257">
couch in a &s;woon; and while the matron of the
hou&s;e admini&s;tered to her no&s;trils, the chairmen
&s;ecured the poor gallant, who&s;e faculties were
actually &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the exta&s;y of his fear.</P>
<P>The lady having a little recollected her &s;pirits,
and looking around, without perceiving her hu&s;|band,
concluded that he was &s;atisfied of her in|nocence,
by the artifice of her behaviour, and
omitted to &s;hew him&s;elf, that &s;he might not be
&s;hocked at his appearance. On this &s;uppo&s;ition,
&s;he renewed her clamour again&s;t the count, whom
&s;he reviled with the epithets of perfidious wretch,
and abominable ruffian; and expre&s;&s;ed her doubts
about the hone&s;ty of the hou&s;e, to which (&s;he
&s;aid) he had decoyed her, on pretence of &s;hewing
&s;ome laces of a new pattern, that the milliner had
received from abroad.</P>
<P>The landlady was no &s;tranger to her per&s;on
or character, and therefore had never doubted
the truth of the count's information, when he
made her privy to the nature of this interview;
but her lady&s;hip's pre&s;ent behaviour, (the true
cau&s;e of which &s;he did not know) intirely al|tered
her opinion; and &s;he now believed, that
the count intended to have made her hou&s;e the
&s;cene of a rape in good earne&s;t. This &s;ugge&s;tion
dive&s;ted her of all regard for her cu&s;tomer,
again&s;t whom &s;he exclaimed with great viru|lence,
as a per&s;on who had endeavoured to in|tail
the cur&s;e of infamy upon her hou&s;e; and
a&s;&s;ured the plaintiff, that he had hired the apart|ment
for a young lady, whom he pretended to
have privately e&s;pou&s;ed, without the con&s;ent of
her parents, from who&s;e inquiries he had rea&s;ons
to conceal the place of her abode.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="258">
The rueful foreigner, baited with their joint
invectives, and more than half di&s;tracted with
the terrors of an Engli&s;h jury, never dream'd of
attempting to vindicate him&s;elf from the imputa|tion
he had incurred; becau&s;e he imagined the
whole affair was the re&s;ult of a con&s;piracy again&s;t
his life and fortune; but falling upon his knees
before his accu&s;er, in the mo&s;t &s;uppliant manner,
implored her pardon, which he offered to ac|knowledge
by a pre&s;ent of a thou&s;and pounds.
Had the&s;e terms been &s;ea&s;onably propo&s;ed, mat|ters
would &s;oon have been brought to an accom|modation;
but &s;he could not decently enter into
a treaty with him, in pre&s;ence of &s;uch witne&s;&s;es;
and be&s;ides, &s;he believed her&s;elf &s;till under the
in&s;pection of her hu&s;band. She therefore rejected
his proffer with di&s;dain, ob&s;erving, that his guilt
was of &s;uch a nature, as to preclude all hopes of
forgivene&s;s; and ordered the chairmen to take
charge of his per&s;on, until he &s;hould be taken in|to
cu&s;tody by an officer properly authorized.</P>
<P>Having given the&s;e directions, at which the
poor pri&s;oner wrung his hands in horror and de|&s;pair,
&s;he withdrew with the matron into another
room, in expectation of being vi&s;ited by her hu&s;|band;
and after having waited &s;ome time with
manife&s;t impatience, could not forbear a&s;king if
there were any other lodgers in the hou&s;e: when
the landlady replied in the negative, &s;he began to
&s;ift her with a variety of que&s;tions, in the cour&s;e
of which &s;he learn'd, that not a &s;oul had entered
the hou&s;e after her own arrival; and then con|jectured,
that the voice &s;he had mi&s;taken for
her hu&s;band's, mu&s;t have been part of a con|ver&s;ation
that pa&s;&s;ed in the next hou&s;e, from
which &s;he was &s;eparated by a thin party-wall.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="259">
This di&s;covery morti&s;ied her in one re&s;pect,
and pla&s;erd her in another; &s;he was chagrined at
the di&s;agreeable interruption, becau&s;e it laid her
under the nece&s;&s;ity of expo&s;ing her character to
the inquiries of tho&s;e whom her cries had brought
to her affitance; though &s;he was at the &s;ame
time very well &s;atisfied to find that her lord was
ignorant of the adventure, and that it was now
in her power to be revenged upon the count, for
the &s;everity of his behaviour, when he acted in
the capacity of her creditor. She therefore re&s;|olved
to extrot a &s;um of money from him, by
way6 for compo&s;ition; and, under pretence of
hu&s;hing up an affair, which might (otherwi&s;e)
give &s;candal an opportunity to be free with her
reputation, &s;ignified to her ho&s;tel&s;a, a de&s;ire of
&s;eeing matters compromi&s;ed.
The prudent miliner applauded her modera|tion,
by which, &s;he fore&s;aw that her own cha|racter
would e&s;cape cen&s;ure; and being favoured
with her lady&s;hip's confidence, went out imme|diately,
in order to communicate her propo&s;als to
the pri&s;oner; but while the&s;e deliberations were
upon the carpet, he had employed his rhetyoric to
&s;ucce&s;sfully upon his guard, that they were pre|valed
upon to &s;et him at liberty, and make their
own retreat, at the &s;ame time. So that her la|dy&s;ship's
&s;cheme proved abortive, and &s;he was fain
to retire to her own hou&s;e, meditating further
vengeance upon the fugitive, who did not think
proper to &s;tand the brunt of her indignation; but
cecamped that night for his native country, in
which he happley &s;ecured his retreat, fully per|&s;uaded,
that his run had been planned by a pow|erful
confederacy in England, of which my lady
who the chief in&s;trument.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="260">
Mean while, our young gentleman and his
tutor enjoyed the con&s;ternation and perplexity
which they had produced, as an whole&s;ome cha|&s;ti&s;ement
be&s;towed upon a profligate virago, lo&s;t
to all &s;en&s;e of oeconomy and decorum, and a ju&s;t
puni&s;hment inflicted upon an infamous adven|turer,
who not only pillaged, but al&s;o di&s;graced
the company by whom he was care&s;&s;ed. It was
in con&s;equence of this adventure, that Peregrine
conceived a very ludicrous project, the execution
of which furni&s;hed entertainment and admiration
to all the fa&s;hionable people in town. The ap|pearance
of Cadwallader in a female dre&s;s, was &s;o
uncouth and preternatural, that the good mil|liner,
who chanced to be favoured with a glimp&s;e
of him, as he went up &s;tairs with his &s;uppo&s;ed
gallant, was not only a&s;toni&s;hed, but affrighted
at the peculiarity of his countenance; and not|with&s;tanding
her well-tried di&s;cretion, which had
never permitted her curio&s;ity to exceed the
bounds of complai&s;ance, &s;he could not forbear
calling her &s;on Pickle into another room, after
her lady&s;hip's retreat; and a&s;king with manife&s;t
marks of confu&s;ion and di&s;quiet, if the per&s;on
whom he had brought into her hou&s;e, was really
and <HI>bona &s;ide</HI> a woman and a chri&s;tian; at the
&s;ame time, expre&s;&s;ing her &s;u&s;picion, from the
de&s;po&s;ition of his companion's wrinkles, and the
bri&s;tles that appeared upon her chin, that &s;he
was no better than a witch or a conjurer, whom
he had employed to embroil and expo&s;e her cu|&s;tomers
by the art of &s;orcery, for which &s;he
prayed God would forgive him. &startq;Certain I
am (&s;aid &s;he) the count and my lady went into
the chamber with the di&s;po&s;ition of two lambs,
$word$ in the twinkling of an eye, (Lord have
<PB N="256" REF="261">
mercy upon us!) there was nothing to be heard
but di&s;cord and de&s;peration! Ah! Mr. Pickle,
Mr. Pickle! it was for no charitable end, that
you was &s;o anxious to occupy the next room. I
thought there was &s;omething unnatural in the
ca&s;e, when I &s;aw you lead up that old beldame
with the beard. You have ruined the reputation
of my hou&s;e, Mr. Pickle. My good friends the
counte&s;s of Peppermar&s;h, lady Tickletoe, and
Mrs. Riggle, will never enter my doors again.
I &s;hall be deprived of getting an hone&s;t liveli|hood;
and all by the cruelty of one that I loved
as well as if I had been the mother that bore
him. O that ever I was born to &s;ee this unlucky
day!&endq; The&s;e words &s;he accompanied with &s;un|dry
&s;obs, and a few <HI>extempore</HI> tears, the nature
of which he perfectly under&s;tood; and therefore
pre&s;cribed a cordial which in a moment &s;et her

giving re&s;pon&s;es in the character of a profe&s;&s;ed
<PB N="257" REF="262">
conjurer, to be per&s;onated by the old Mi&s;an|thrope,
who&s;e a&s;pect was extremely well calcu|lated
for the purpo&s;e. The plan was imme|diately
adju&s;ted in all its parts; an apartment
hired in an hou&s;e accommodated with a public
&s;tair; &s;o that people might have free ingre&s;s and
egre&s;s, without being expo&s;ed to ob&s;ervation;
and this tenement being furni&s;hed with the appa|ratus
of a magician, &s;uch as globes, tele&s;copes,
a magic $$nthorn, a &s;keleton, a dried monkey,
together with the &s;kins of an alligator, otter and
&s;nake, the conjurer him&s;elf took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his
ca&s;tle, after having di&s;tributed printed adverti&s;e|ments,
containing the particulars of his under|taking.</P>
<P>The&s;e bills &s;oon operated according to the wi&s;h
of the projectors. As the price of the oracle
was fixed at half a guine$, the public naturally
concluded, that the author was no common for|tune-teller;
and the very next day, Peregrine
found &s;ome ladies of his quality-acquaintance, in|fected
with the de&s;ire of making an experiment
upon the &s;kill of this new conjurer, who pretended
to be ju&s;t arrived from the Mogul's empire,
where he had learned the art from a Brachman
philo&s;opher. Our young gentleman affected to
talk of the preten&s;ions of this &s;age with ridicule
and contempt, and with &s;eeming reluctance, un|dertook
to attend them to his apartment, ob|&s;erving,
that it would be a very ea&s;y matter to
detect the fellow's ignorance, and no more than
common ju&s;tice to cha&s;ti&s;e him for his pre&s;ump|tion.
Though he could ea&s;ily perceive a great
fund of credulity in the company, they affected
to e&s;pou&s;e his opinion, and under the notion
of a frolic, agreed, that one particular lady
<PB N="258" REF="263">
&s;hould endeavour to ba&s;&s;le his art, by appearing
before him in the dre&s;s of her woman, who
&s;hould, at the &s;ame time, per&s;onate her mi&s;tre&s;s,
and be treated as &s;uch by our adventurer, who
promi&s;ed to &s;quire them to the place. The&s;e
mea&s;ures being concerted, and the appointment
fixed for the next audience-day, Peregrine fur|ni&s;hed
his friend with the nece&s;&s;ary information;
and when the hour of a&s;&s;ignation arrived, con|ducted
his cha$ge to this oraculous &s;eer.</P>
<P>They were admitted by our hero's valet d$
chambre, who&s;e vi&s;age being naturally meagre
and &s;warthy, was adorned with artificial whi&s;kers;
&s;o that he became the Per&s;ian dre&s;s which he
were, and &s;eemed a very proper ma&s;ter of the
ceremonies to an oriental Necromancer. Having
cro&s;&s;ed his arms upon his brea&s;t, with an incli|nation
of the head, he &s;talked in &s;olemn &s;ilence
before them into the Penetralia of the temple,
where they &s;ound the conjurer &s;itting at a table,
provided with pen, ink and paper, divers books
and mathematical in&s;truments, and a long white
wand lying acro&s;s the whole. He was habited
in a black grown and fur-cap, and his countenance,
over and above a double proportion of philo&s;ophic
gravity which he had a&s;&s;umed for the occa&s;ion,
was improved by a thick beard white as &s;now,
that reached to his middle, and upon each &s;houlder
&s;at a prodigious large black cat which had been
tutored for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Such a figure, which would have &s;tartled Pe|regrine
him&s;elf, had not be been concerned in
the my&s;tery, could not fail to make an impre&s;&s;ion
upon the&s;e whom he accompanied. The ficti|tious
chambermaid, in &s;pite of all her natural
pertne&s;s and vivacity, changed colour when &s;he
<PB N="259" REF="264">
entered the room, and the pretended lady, who&s;e
intellects were not quite &s;o enlightened, began to
tremble in every joint, and ejaculate petitions to
heaven for her &s;afety. Their conductor ad|vancing
to the table, pre&s;ented his offering, and
pointing to the <HI>&s;uivante,</HI> told him, that lady de|&s;ired
to know what would be her $word$ in point
of marriage. The philo&s;opher, without lifting
up his eyes to view the per&s;on in who&s;e behalf he
was con&s;ulted, turned his ear to one of the &s;able
familiars that purred upon his &s;houlder, and
taking up the pen, wrote upon a detached &s;lip of
paper the&s;e words, which Peregrine, at the de|&s;ire
of the ladies, repeated aloud, &startq;Her de&s;tiny
will, in a great mea&s;ure, depend upon what hap|pened
to her about nine o'clock in the morning,
on the third day of la&s;t December.&endq;</P>
<P>This &s;entence was no &s;ooner pronounced, than
the counterfeit lady uttered a fearful &s;cream, and
ran out into the antichamber, exclaiming, &startq;Chri&s;t
have mercy upon us! Sure he is the devil incar|nate!&endq;
Her mi&s;tre&s;s, who followed her with
great con&s;ternation, in&s;i&s;ted upon knowing the
tran&s;action to which the re&s;pon&s;e alluded; and
Mrs. Abigail, after &s;ome recollection, gave her
to under&s;tand, that &s;he had an admirer, who, on
the very hour and day mentioned by the cunning
man, had addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to her in a &s;erious pro|po&s;al
of marriage. This explanation, however,
was more ingenious than candid; for the admirer
was no other than the identical Mr. Pickle him|&s;elf,
who was a meer dragon among the chamber|maids,
and, in his previous information com|municated
to his a&s;&s;ociate, had given an account
of this a&s;&s;ignation, with which he had been fa|voured
by the dam&s;el in que&s;tion.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="265">
Our hero &s;eeing his company very much af|fected
with this circum&s;tance of the wizzard's art,
which had almo&s;t frighted both mi&s;tre&s;s and maid
into hy&s;teric fits, pretended to laugh them out of
their fears, by ob&s;erving that there was nothing
extraordinary in this in&s;tance of his knowledge,
which might have been acquired by &s;ome of tho&s;e
&s;ecret emi&s;&s;aries whom &s;uch impo&s;tors are obliged
to employ for intelligence, or imparted by the
lover him&s;elf, who had, perhaps, come to con|&s;ult
him about the &s;ucce&s;s of his amour. En|couraged
by this ob&s;ervation, or rather prompted
by an in&s;atiable curio&s;ity, which was proof
again&s;t all &s;ort of apprehen&s;ion, the di&s;gui&s;ed lady
returned to the magician's own apartment, and
a&s;&s;uming the air of a pert chambermaid, &startq;Mr.
Conjurer (&s;aid &s;he) now you have &s;atisfied my
mi&s;tre&s;s, will you be &s;o good as to tell me, if
ever I &s;hall be married?&endq; The &s;age, without the
lea&s;t he&s;itation, favoured her with an an&s;wer, in
the following words: &startq;You cannot be married
before you are a widow; and whether or not
that will ever be the ca&s;e, is a que&s;tion which my
art cannot re&s;olve, becau&s;e my foreknowledge ex|ceeds
not the term of thirty years.&endq;</P>
<P>This reply, which at once cut her off from
the plea&s;ing pro&s;pect of &s;eeing her&s;elf independent
in the enjoyment of youth and fortune, in a mo|ment
clouded her a&s;pect; all her good humour
was overca&s;t, and &s;he went away, without fur|ther
inquiry, muttering, in the rancour of her
$hagrin, that he was a Silly impertinent fellow,
and a meer quack in his profe&s;&s;ion. Notwith|&s;tanding
the prejudice of this re&s;entment, her
$onviction &s;oon recurred; and when the report of
his an&s;wer$ was made to tho&s;e confederates by
<PB N="261" REF="266">
whom &s;he had been deputed to make trial of his
&s;kill, they were univer&s;ally per&s;uaded that his art
was altogether &s;upernatural, tho' each affected
to treat it with contempt, re&s;olving, in her own
brea&s;t, to have recour&s;e to him in private.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the maid, tho' laid under
the mo&s;t peremptory injunctions of &s;ecrecy, was
&s;o full of the circum&s;tance which related to her
own conduct, that &s;he extolled his pre&s;cience, in
whi&s;pers to all her acquaintance, a&s;&s;uring them,
that he had told her all the particulars of her life;
&s;o that his $ame was almo&s;t in&s;tantaneo&s;ly con|veyed,
thro' a thou&s;and different channels, to all
parts of the town; and the very next time he a&s;|&s;umed
the chair, his doors were be&s;ieged by cu|rious
people of all &s;ects and denominations.</P>
<P>Being an old practitioner in this art, Cadwal|laner
knew it would be impo&s;&s;ible for him to &s;up|port
his reputation in the promi&s;cuous exerci&s;e of
fortune-telling, becau&s;e every per&s;on that &s;hould
come to con&s;ult him would expect a &s;ample of his
&s;kill, relating to things pa&s;t; and it could not be
&s;uppo&s;ed, that he was acquainted with the private
concerns of every individual who might apply to
him for that purpo&s;e: he therefore ordered his
mini&s;ter, whom he di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of
Hadgi Rourk, to &s;ignify to all tho&s;e who de|manded
entrance, that his price was half a guinea;
and that all &s;uch as were not di&s;po&s;ed to gratify him
with that con&s;ideration would do well to leave the
pa&s;&s;age free for the re&s;t.</P>
<P>This declaration &s;ucceeded to his wi&s;h; for
this congregation con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of footmen,
chambermaids, prentices, and the lower cla&s;s of
trade&s;men, who could not afford to purcha&s;e
pre&s;cience at &s;uch a price; &s;o that, after fruitl$&s;s
<PB N="262" REF="267">
offers of &s;hillings and half crowns, they dropped
off one by one, and left the field open for cu&s;|tomers
of an higher rank.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t per&s;on of this &s;pecies who appeared
was dre&s;&s;ed like the wife of a &s;ub&s;tantial trade&s;|man;
but this di&s;gui&s;e could not &s;creen her from
the penetration of the conjurer, who at fir&s;t &s;ight
knew her to be one of the ladies of who&s;e coming
he had been apprized by Peregrine, on the &s;up|po&s;ition
that their curio&s;ity was rather inflamed
than allayed by the intelligence they had receiv|ed
from his fir&s;t client. This lady approached
the philo&s;opher with that intrepidity of counte|nance
&s;o con&s;picuous in matrons of her dignified
&s;phere, and in a &s;oft voice, a&s;ked with a &s;imper,
of what complexion her next child would be?
The necromancer, who was perfectly well ac|quainted
with her private hi&s;tory, forthwith de|livered
his re&s;pon&s;e in the following que&s;tion,
written in the u&s;ual form, &startq;How long has Pom|pey
the black been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from your lady&s;hip's
&s;ervice?&endq;</P>
<P>Endued as &s;he was with a great &s;hare of that
fortitude which is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appellation
of effrontery, her face exhibited &s;ome &s;igns of
&s;hame and confu&s;ion at the receit of this oracu|lar
interrogation, by which &s;he was convinced of
his extraordinary intelligence; and acco&s;ting him
in a very &s;erious tone, &startq;Doctor (&s;aid &s;he) I per|ceive
you are a per&s;on of great abilities in the art
you profe&s;s; and therefore, without pretending
to di&s;&s;emble, I will own you have touched the
true &s;tring of my apprehen&s;ions. I am per&s;uaded
I need not be more particular in my inquiries.
Here is a pur&s;e of money; take it, and deliver
me from a mo&s;t alarming and unea&s;y &s;u&s;pence.&endq;
So &s;aying, &s;he depo&s;ited her offering upon the
<PB N="263" REF="268">
table, and waited for his an&s;wer with a face of
fearful expectation, while he was employed in
writing this &s;entence for her peru&s;al: &startq;Tho' I
&s;ee into the womb of time, the pro&s;pect is not
perfectly di&s;tinct; the &s;eeds of future events lie
mingled and confu&s;ed: &s;o that I am under the
nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;&s;i&s;ting my divination in &s;ome ca&s;es,
by analogy and human intelligence; and cannot
po&s;&s;ibly &s;atisfy your pre&s;ent doubts, unle&s;s you
will conde&s;cend to make me privy to all tho&s;e
occurrences which you think might have inter|fered
with the cau&s;e of your apprehen&s;ion.&endq;</P>
<P>The lady having read the declaration, affected
a &s;mall emotion of &s;hyne&s;s and repugnance, and
&s;eating her&s;elf upon a &s;ettee, after having cau|tiou&s;ly
informed her&s;elf of the privacy of the
apartment, gave &s;uch a detail of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
h$r lovers, as amazed while it entertained the ne|cromancer,
as well as his friend Pickle, who
from a clo&s;et in which he had concealed him&s;elf,
overheard every &s;yllable of her confe&s;&s;ion. Cad|wallader
li&s;tened to her &s;tory with a look of in|finite
importance and &s;agacity, and after a &s;hort
pau&s;e told her, that he would not pretend to give
a categorical an&s;wer, until he &s;hould have deli|berated
maturely upon the various circum&s;tances
of the aff$$r; but if &s;he would take the trouble of
honouring him with another vi&s;it on his next
public day, he hoped he &s;hould be able to give
her full &s;atisfaction. Con&s;cious of the importance
of her d$$bts, &s;$e could not help commending
his caution, and took her leave, with a promi&s;e
of returning at the appointed time; then the
conjurer being joined by his a&s;&s;ociate, they gave
a loo&s;e to their $word$, which having indulged,
they began to concert mea&s;ures for $word$ $word$

di&s;graceful puni&s;hment on the &s;hamele&s;s and in&s;a|tiate
termagant who had &s;o impudently avowed
her own pro&s;titution.</P>
<P>They were interrupted, however, in their
conference, by the arrival of a new gue&s;t, who
being announced by Hadgi, our hero retreated to
his lurking-place, and Cadwallader re&s;umed his
my&s;terious appearance. This new client, tho'
&s;he hid her face in a ma&s;k, could not conceal her|&s;elf
from the knowledge of the conjurer, who by
her voice recognized her to be an unmarried
lady of his own acquaintance. She had, within
a &s;mall compa&s;s of time, made her&s;elf remark|able
for two adventures, which had not at all
&s;ucceeded to her expectation: being very much
addicted to play, &s;he had, at a certain route, in|dulged
that pa&s;&s;ion to &s;uch exce&s;s, as not only got
the better of her ju&s;tice, but al&s;o of her circum|&s;pection;
&s;o that &s;he was unfortunately detected
in her endeavours to appropriate to her&s;elf what
was not lawfully her due. This &s;mall &s;lip was
attended with another indi&s;cretion, which had
likewi&s;e an unlucky effect upon her reputation.
She had been favoured with the addre&s;&s;es of one
of tho&s;e hopeful heirs who &s;warm and &s;wagger
about town, under the denomination of Bucks;
and in the confidence of his honour con&s;ented to
be one of a partie that made an excur&s;ion as far as
Wind&s;or, thinking her&s;elf &s;ecured from &s;candal by
the company of another young lady, who had
al&s;o conde&s;cended to tru&s;t her per&s;on to the pro|tection
of her admirer. The two gallants, in
the cour&s;e of this expedition, were &s;aid to u&s;e the
mo&s;t perfidious means to intoxicate the pa&s;&s;ions
of their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, by mixing drugs with their
<PB N="265" REF="270">
wine, which inflamed their con&s;titutions to &s;uch
a degree, that they fell an ea&s;y &s;acrifice to the
appetites of their conductors, who, upon their
return to town, were &s;o ba&s;e and inhuman as to
boa&s;t among their companions of the exploit they
had atchieved. Thus the &s;tory was circulated,
with a thou&s;and additional circum&s;tances to the
prejudice of the &s;ufferers, one of whom had
thought proper to withdraw into the country, un|til
the &s;candal rai&s;ed at her expence &s;hould &s;ub|&s;ide;
while the other, who was not &s;o ea&s;ily put
out of countenance, re&s;olved to outface the re|port,
as a treacherous a&s;per&s;ion, invented by her
lover as an excu&s;e for his own incon&s;tancy; and
actually appeared in public, as u&s;ual, till &s;he
found her&s;elf neglected by the greate&s;t part of her
acquaintance.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this di&s;grace, which &s;he
knew not wh$ther to impute to the card affair,
or to the la&s;t <HI>faux pas</HI> &s;he had committed, &s;he
now came to con&s;ult the conjurer, and &s;ignified
her errand, by a&s;king whether the cau&s;e of her
pre&s;ent di&s;quiet was of the town or country?
Cadwallader at once perceiving her allu&s;ion, an|&s;wered
her que&s;tion in the&s;e terms. &startq;This hone&s;t
world will forgive a young game&s;ter for indi&s;cretion
at play, but a favour granted to a blabbing cox|comb
is an unpardonable offence.&endq; This repon&s;e
&s;he received with equal a&s;toni&s;hment and cha|gri$;
and, fully convinced of the necromancer's
om$i&s;cience, implored his advice touching the
retrieval of her reputation: upon which he coun|&s;elled
her to wed with the fir&s;t opportunity;
and &s;he &s;eemed &s;o well plea&s;ed with his admoni|tion,
that &s;he gratified him with a double fee, and
dropping a low curt'&s;y, retired.</P>

Our undertakers now thought it high time to
&s;ilence the oracle for the day, and Hadgi was ac|cordingly

<HEAD>CHAP. XCI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine and his friend Cadwallader proceed in
the exerci&s;e of the my&s;t$ry of fortune-telling, in
the cour&s;e of which they atchieve various adven|tures.</HEAD>
<P>THESE preliminaries being adju&s;ted, our
hero forthwith repaired to a card a&s;&s;embly,
which was frequented by &s;ome of the mo&s;t not|able
go&s;&s;ips in town, and having artfully turned
the conver&s;ation upon the &s;ubject of the fortune-teller,
who&s;e talents he pretended to ridic$le, in|cen&s;ed
their itch of knowing &s;ecrets to &s;uch a de|gree
of impatience, that their curio&s;ity became
flagrant, and he took it for granted$ that all or
&s;ome of them would vi&s;it Albuma$$ on his very
fir&s;t vi&s;iting-day. While Peregrine was thus en|gaged,
his a&s;&s;ociate made his appearance in ano|ther
convocation of fa&s;hionable people, where
he &s;oon had the plea&s;ure of hearing the conjurer
brought upon the carpet by an elderly gentlewo|man,
<PB N="267" REF="272">
remarkable for her inqui&s;itive di&s;po&s;ition,
who addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to Cadwallader, a&s;ked, by
the help of the finger-alphabet, if he knew any
thing of the magician that made &s;uch a noi&s;e in
town? The mi&s;anthrope an&s;wered as u&s;ual, in
a &s;urly tone, &startq;By your que&s;tion you mu&s;t either
take me for a pimp or an ideot. What, in the
name of non&s;en&s;e, &s;hould I know of &s;uch a ra&s;|cal,
unle&s;s I were to court his acquaintance with
a view to fea&s;t my own &s;pleen, in &s;eeing him fool
the whole nation out of their money? Tho', I
&s;uppo&s;e, his chief profits ari&s;e from his practice,
in quality of pander. All fortune-tellers are
bawds, and for that rea&s;on are &s;o much followed
by people of fa&s;hion. This fellow (I warrant)
has got &s;undry convenient apartments for the be|nefit
of procreation; for it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed
that tho&s;e who vi&s;it him on the pretence of con|&s;ulting
his &s;upernatural art, can be &s;uch fools,
&s;uch drivelers, as to believe that he can actually
progno&s;ticate future events.&endq;</P>
<P>The company, according to his expectation,
imputed his remarks to the rancour of his di&s;po|&s;ition,
which could not bear to think that any
per&s;on upon earth was wi&s;er than him&s;elf; and
his ears were regaled with a thou&s;and in&s;tances of
the conjurer's wonderful pre&s;cience, for which
he was altogether indebted to fiction. Some of
the&s;e &s;pecimens being communicated to him, by
way of appeal to his opinion, &startq;They are (&s;aid
he) meer phantoms of ignorance and credulity,
&s;welled up in the repetition, like tho&s;e un&s;ub|&s;tantial
bubbles which the boys blow up in &s;oap|&s;uds
with a tobacco pipe. And this will ever be
the ca&s;e in the propagation of all extraordinary
intelligence: the imagination naturally magnifies
<PB N="270" REF="273">
$dant &s;eeing him very much irritated, po&s;itively
denied that he had mentioned a brace; one in|deed
(&s;aid he) I own I took notice of, upon the
authority of your own phy&s;ician, who gave me
an account of it this morning.&endq; &startq;By the Lord!
(cried the &s;ufferer in a rage which he could no
longer contain) that ra&s;cal has been &s;uborned by
my rival, to &s;lander my character in this man|ner;
but I'll be revenged, if there be either law
or equity in England.&endq; He had &s;carce pro|nounced
the&s;e words, when the doctor happened
to enter the room; when his exa&s;perated patient
li$ting up his cane, &startq;Sirrah (&s;aid he) if I live,
I'll make that black crow the blacke&s;t circum|&s;tance
of thy whole life and conver&s;ation.&endq; The
phy&s;ician, confounded at this addre&s;s, a&s;&s;ured
him that he was utterly ignorant of his meaning,
and when the other gentleman explained it, ab|&s;olutely
denied the charge, affirming he had &s;aid
no more than that he had vomited a quantity of
&s;omething as black as a crow. The landlord of
the hou&s;e acknowledged that he might have been
mi&s;taken; and thus the whole my&s;tery was ex|plained.&endq;</P>
<P>The company &s;eemed to reli&s;h the &s;tory of the
three black crows, which they con&s;idered as an
impromptu of Cadwallader's own invention; but,
granting it to be true, they unanimou&s;ly declared
that it could have no weight in invalidating the
te&s;timony of divers per&s;ons of honour, who had
been witne&s;&s;es of the magician's &s;upernatural
&s;kill. On the next day of con&s;ultation, the ne|cromancer
being in the chair, and his friend be|hind
the curtain, the outward door was &s;carce
opened, when a female vi&s;itant flounced in, and
di&s;covered to the magician the features of one of
<PB N="271" REF="274">
tho&s;e inqui&s;itive ladies, who&s;e curio&s;ity, he knew,
his confederate had arou&s;ed, in the manner above
de&s;cribed. She addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to him with a
familiar air, ob&s;erving, that &s;he had heard much
of his great knowledge, and was come to be a
witne&s;s of his art, which &s;he de&s;ired him to di&s;|play,
in declaring what he knew to be her ruling
pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Cadwallader, who was no &s;tranger to her di&s;|po&s;ition,
a&s;&s;umed the pen without he&s;itation, and
f$rni&s;hed her with an an&s;wer, importing, that
the love of money predominated, and &s;candal
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the next place in her heart. Far from
being offended at his freedom, &s;he commended
his frankne&s;s with a &s;mile; and, &s;atisfied of his
uncomm$n talents, expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of being
better acquainted with his per&s;on: nay, &s;he
began to catechi&s;e him, upon the private hi&s;tory
of dive$s great families, in which he happened
to be well ver&s;ed; and he, in a my&s;terious man|ner,
dropt &s;uch artful hints of his knowledge,
that &s;he was amazed at his capacity, and actually
a&s;ked if his art was communicable. The con|jurer
replied in the affirmative; but, at the &s;ame
time, gave her to under&s;tand, that it was attain|able
by tho&s;e only who were pure and undefiled
in point of cha&s;tity and honour; or &s;uch as, by
a long cour&s;e of penitence, had weaned them|&s;elves
from all attachments to the fle&s;h. She not
only di&s;approved, but &s;eemed to doubt the truth
of this a&s;&s;ertion; telling him, with a look of
di&s;dain, that his art was not worth having, if one
could not u&s;e it for the benefit of one's plea&s;ure:
&s;he had even penetration enough to take notice
of an incon&s;i&s;tency in what he had advanced;
and asked, why he him&s;elf exerci&s;ed his know|ledge
<PB N="272" REF="275">
for hire, if he was &s;o much detached from
all worldly concerns. &startq;Come, come, doctor,
added &s;he, you are in the right to be cautious
again&s;t impertinent curio&s;ity; but, perhaps, I
may make it worth your while to be communi|cative.&endq;</P>
<P>The&s;e overtures were interrupted by a rap at
the door, &s;ignifying the approach of another
client; upon which the lady inquired for his
private pa&s;&s;age, thro' which &s;he might retire,
without the ri&s;que of being &s;een: and when &s;he
under&s;tood he was deficient in that convenience,
&s;he withdrew into an empty room, adjoining to
the audience-chamber, in order to conceal her&s;elf
from the ob&s;ervation of the new-comer. This
was no other than the inamorata, who came by
appointment to receive the &s;olution of her doubts:
and the Mi&s;anthrope, glad of an opportunity to
expo&s;e her to the cen&s;ure of &s;uch an indefatigable
mini&s;ter of &s;ame as the per&s;on, who (he knew)
would li&s;ten from the next apartment; laid her
under the nece&s;&s;ity of refre&s;hing his remembrance
with a recapitulation of her former confe&s;&s;ion,
which was almo&s;t fini&s;hed, when &s;he was alarmed
by a noi&s;e at the door, occa&s;ioned by two gentle|men
who attempted to enter by force.</P>
<P>Terrified at this uproar, which di&s;concerted
the magician him&s;elf, &s;he ran for &s;helter into the
place which was pre-occupied by the other lady,
who, hearing this di&s;turbance, had clo&s;ed the
window-&s;hutters, that &s;he might have the better
chance of remaining unknown. Here they en|&s;conced
them&s;elves, in the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation,
while the necromancer, after &s;ome recollection,
ordered Hadgi to open the door, and admit the
rioters, who (he hoped) would be over-awed by
<PB N="273" REF="276">
the authority of his appearance. The janitor
had no &s;ooner obeyed his in&s;tructions, than in
ru&s;hed a young libertine, who had been for &s;ome
time upon the town, together with his tutor,
who was a worn-out debauchee, well known to
the magician. They were both in that degree of
intoxication nece&s;&s;ary to prepare &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions
for what they commonly call frolicks, and the
&s;ober part of mankind feel to be extravagant out|rages
again&s;t the laws of their country, and the
peace of their fellow-&s;ubjects. Having &s;taggered
up to the table, the &s;enior, who undertook to be
&s;poke&s;man, &s;aluted Cadwallader with &startq;How
do'&s;t do, old Capricorn? Thou &s;eem'&s;t to be a
mo&s;t venerable pimp, and, I doubt not, ha&s;t
abundance of di&s;cretion. Here is this young
whorema&s;ter (a true chip of the old venereal
block his father) and my&s;elf, come for a comfort|able
ca&s;t of thy function. I don't mean that
&s;tale pretence of conjuring: damn futurity; let
us live for the pre&s;ent, old Haly. Conjure me
up a couple of hale wenches, and, I warrant,
we &s;hall get into the magic circle in a twinkling.
What &s;a$s Galileo? What &s;ays the reverend
Brahe? Here is a pur&s;e, you pimp: hark, how it
chinks! This is &s;weeter than the mu&s;ick of the
&s;pheres.&endq;</P>
<P>Our necromancer, perplexed at this rencoun|ter,
made no reply; but taking up his wand,
waved it around his head in a very my&s;terious
motion, with a view of intimidating the&s;e for|ward
vi&s;itants, who, far from being awed by
this &s;ort of evolution, became more and more ob|&s;treperous,
and even threatened to pull h$m by
the beard, if he would not immediately comply
with their de&s;ire. Had he called his a&s;&s;ociate, or
<PB N="274" REF="277">
even Hadgi, to his aid, he knew he could have
&s;oon calmed their turbulence; but, being unwil|ling
to run the ri&s;que of a di&s;covery, or even of
a riot, he bethought him&s;elf of cha&s;ti&s;ing their
in&s;olence in another manner that would be le&s;s
hazardous, and rather more effectual. In con|&s;equence
of this &s;ugge&s;tion, he pointed his wand
towards the door of the apartment in which the
ladies had taken &s;anctuary; and the two rakes,
under&s;tanding the hint, ru&s;hed in without he&s;i|tation.</P>
<P>The females finding their place of retreat
taken by a&s;&s;ault, ran about the room in great
con&s;ternation, and were immediately taken pri|&s;oners
by the a&s;&s;ailants, who pulling them to|wards
the windows, opened the &s;hutters at the
&s;ame in&s;tant of time, when (&s;trange to tell!) one
of the heroes di&s;covered, in the prize he had made,
the very wife of his bo&s;om; and his companion
perceived that he had &s;tumbled in the dark upon
his own mother. Their mutual a&s;toni&s;hment
was un&s;peakable at this eclairci&s;&s;ement, which
produced an univer&s;al &s;ilence for the &s;pace of &s;e|veral
minutes; and during this pau&s;e the ladies
having recollected them&s;elves, an expo&s;tulation
was begun by the elder of the two, who roundly
took her &s;on to task for his di&s;orderly life, which
laid her under the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity of watch|ing
his motions, and detecting him in &s;uch an
infamous place.</P>
<P>While the careful mother thus exerci&s;ed her
talent for reprehen&s;ion, the hopeful young gen|tleman,
with an hand in each fob, &s;tood whi&s;tling
an opera-tune, without &s;eeming to pay the mo&s;t
profound regard to his parent's reproof: and the
other lady, in imitation of &s;uch a con&s;ummate
<PB N="275" REF="278">
pattern, began to open upon her hu&s;band, whom
&s;he bitterly reproached with his loo&s;ene&s;s and in|temperance,
demanding to know what he had to
alledge in alleviation of his pre&s;ent mi&s;conduct.
The &s;urprize occa&s;ioned by &s;uch an unexpected
meeting had already in a great mea&s;ure de&s;troyed
the effects of the wine he had &s;o plentifully drank,
and the fir&s;t u&s;e he made of his recovered &s;obriety,
was to revolve within him&s;elf the motives that
could po&s;&s;ibly induce his wife to give him the
rendezvous in this manner. As he had good
rea&s;on to believe &s;he was utterly void of jealou&s;y,
he naturally placed this rencontre to the account
of another pa&s;&s;ion; and his chagrin was not at
all impaired by the effrontery with which &s;he now
pre&s;umed to reprimand him. He li&s;tened to her,
therefore, with a grave, or rather grim a&s;pect;
and to the que&s;tion with which &s;he concluded her
rebuke, an&s;wered with great compo&s;ure, &startq;All
that I have to alledge, madam, is that the bawd
has committed a mi&s;take, in con&s;equence of
which we are both di&s;appointed: and &s;o, ladies,
your humble &s;ervant.&endq; So &s;aying, he retired
with manife&s;t confu&s;ion in his looks; and as he
pa&s;&s;ed through the audience-chamber, eying the
conjurer a&s;kance, pronounced the epithet of <HI>pre|cious
ra&s;cal,</HI> with great empha&s;is. Mean while,
the junior, like a dutiful child, handed his
mamma to her chair; and the other client, after
having reviled the necromancer, becau&s;e he could
not fore&s;ee this event, went away in a &s;tate of
mortification.</P>
<P>The coa&s;t being clear, Peregrine came forth
from his den, and congratulated his friend upon
the peaceable i&s;&s;ue of the adventure which he had
overheard: but, that he might not be expo&s;ed
<PB N="276" REF="279">
to &s;uch inconvenience for the future, they re|&s;olved,
that a grate &s;hould be fixed in the middle
of the outward door, through which the conjurer
him&s;elf &s;hould reconnoitre all the vi&s;itants, before
their admi&s;&s;ion; &s;o that, to tho&s;e who&s;e appear|ance
he &s;hould not like, Hadgi &s;hould, without
opening, give notice, that his ma&s;ter was en|gaged.
By this expedient too, they provided
again&s;t tho&s;e difficulties which Cadwallader mu&s;t
have encountered, in giving &s;atisfaction to &s;tran|gers,
whom he did not know; for the original
intention of the founders was to confine the prac|tice
of their art to people of fa&s;hion only, mo&s;t
of whom were per&s;onally known to the counter|feit
magician and his coadjutor.</P>
<P>Indeed, the&s;e a&s;&s;ociates, Cadwallader in par|ticular,
notwith&s;tanding his boa&s;ted in$ight into
the characters of life, never imagined that his
pretended &s;kill would be con&s;ulted by any but the
weaker-minded of the female &s;ex, incited by that
&s;pirit of curio&s;ity which he knew was implanted
in their nature: but, in the cour&s;e of his practice,
he found him&s;elf cultivated in his preternatural
capacity, by people of all &s;exes, complexions,
and degrees of reputation, and had occa&s;ion to
ob&s;erve, that when the pa&s;&s;ions are concerned,
how&s;oever cool, cautious and deliberate, the di&s;|po&s;ition
may otherwi&s;e be, there is nothing &s;o
idle, frivolous, or ab&s;urd, to which they will not
apply for encouragement and gratification. The
la&s;t occurrence, according to the hopes and ex|pectation
of the confederates, was whi&s;pered
about by the ladies concerned, in &s;uch a manner,
that the whole affair was, in a few days, the uni|ver&s;al
topic of di&s;cour&s;e, in which it was retailed
with numberle&s;s embeli&s;hments, invented by the
<PB N="277" REF="280">
parties them&s;elves, who had long indulged a pique
at each other, and took this opportunity of en|joying
their revenge.</P>
<P>The&s;e incidents, while they regaled the &s;pleen,
at the &s;ame time augmented the renown of the
conjurer, who was de&s;cribed on both &s;ides as a
very extraordinary per&s;on in his way; and the
alteration in his door was no &s;ooner performed,
than he had occa&s;ion to avail him&s;elf of it, again&s;t
the intru&s;ion of a great many, with whom he
would have found it very difficult to &s;upport the
&s;ame he had acquired.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e who appeared at his grate, he
perceived a certain clergyman, whom he had long
known an humble attendant on the great, and
with &s;ome the reputed mini&s;ter of their plea&s;ures&punc;
This Levite had di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf in a great&punc; coat
boots, and dre&s;s quite foreign to the habit worn
by tho&s;e of his function; and being admitted, at|tempted
to impo&s;e him&s;elf as a country &s;quire
upon the conjurer, who calling him by his name,
de&s;ired him to &s;it down. This reception corre&s;|ponding
with the report he had heard, touching
our magician's art, the doctor &s;aid he would lay
a&s;ide all di&s;&s;imulation; and after having profe&s;&s;ed
an implicit belief, that his &s;upernatural know|ledge
did not proceed from any communication
with evil &s;pirits, but was the immediate gift of
heaven, he declared the intention of his coming
was to inquire into the health of a good friend
and brother of his, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a certain living
in the country, which he named; and, as he
was old and infirm, to know what &s;pace of time
was allotted to him in this frail &s;tate of mortality,
that he might have the melancholy &s;atisfaction of
<PB N="278" REF="281">
attending him in his la&s;t moments, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting
him in his preparations for eternity.</P>
<P>The conjurer, who at once perceived the pur|port
of this que&s;tion, after a &s;olemn pau&s;e, dur|ing
which he &s;eemed ab&s;orpt in contemplation,
delivered this re&s;pon&s;e to his con&s;ulter, &startq;Tho' I
fore&s;ee &s;ome occurrences, I do not pretend to be
omni&s;cient. I know not to what age that cler|gyman's
life will extend, but &s;o far I can pene|trate
into the womb of time, as to di&s;ce$$, that
the incumbent will &s;urvive his intended &s;ucce&s;|&s;or.&endq;
This dreadful &s;entence in a moment ba|ni&s;hed
the blood from the face of the appalled
con&s;ulter, who hearing his own doom pronounc|ed,
began to tremble in every joint; he li&s;ted up
his eyes in the agony of fear, and &s;aying, &startq;The
will of God be done,&endq; withdrew in &s;ilent de&s;pon|dence,
his teeth chattering with terror and di&s;inay.</P>
<P>This client was &s;ucceeded by an old man
about the age of &s;eventy-five, who b$$ng re|&s;olved
to purcha&s;e a lea&s;e, de&s;ired to be deter|mined
in the term of years by the necromancer's
advice, ob&s;erving, that as he had no children of
his own body, and had no regard for his heirs at
law, the purcha&s;e would be made with a view to
his own convenience only; and therefore, con|&s;idering
his age, he him&s;elf he&s;itated in the pe|riod
of the lea&s;e, between thirty and three&s;core
years.</P>
<P>The conjurer, upon due deliberation, ad|vi&s;ed
him to double the la&s;t &s;pecified term, be|cau&s;e
he di&s;tingui&s;hed in his features &s;omething
portending extreme old age and &s;econd childhood,
and he ought to provide for that &s;tate of incapa|city,
which otherwi&s;e would be attended with
infinite mi&s;ery and affliction. The &s;uperannuat|ed
<PB N="297" REF="282">
wretch, thunder&s;truck with this prediction,
held up his hands, and, in the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of
his apprehen&s;ion, exclaimed, &startq;Lord have mercy
upon me! I have not wherewithal to purcha&s;e
&s;uch a long lea&s;e, and I have long outlived all
my friends; what then mu&s;t become of me, &s;in|ner
that I am, one hundred and twenty years
hence!&endq; Cadwallader (who enjoyed his terror)
under pretence of alleviating his concern, told
him, that what he had progno&s;ticated did not de|prive
him of the means which he and every per|&s;on
had in their power, to curtail a life of mis|fortune;
and the old gentleman went away,
&s;eemingly comforted with the a&s;&s;urance, that it
would always be in his power to employ an hal|ter
for his own deliverance.</P>
<P>Soon after the retreat of this elder, the magi|cian
was vi&s;ited by one of tho&s;e worthies known
among the Romans by the appellation of <HI>Here|dipetes,</HI>
who had ama&s;&s;ed a large fortune by a
clo&s;e attention to the immediate wants and
weakne&s;s of raw unexperienced heirs. This ho|nourable
u&s;urer had &s;old an annuity upon the life
of a young &s;pendthri&s;t, being thereto induced by
the affirmation of his phy&s;ician, who had a&s;&s;ured
him his patient's con&s;titution was &s;o rotten, that
he could not live one year to an end: he had, ne|verthele&s;s,
made &s;hi$t to weather eighteen months,
$word$ now &s;eemed more vigorous and healthy than
he had ever been known; for he was &s;uppo&s;ed
to have nouri&s;hed an hereditary pox from his
$word$. Alarmed at this alteration, the &s;ellor
$word$ to con&s;ult Cadwallader not only about the
$word$ of the ann$it$nt, but al&s;o concerning the
$word$ of his health at the time of his purcha&s;ing
$word$ $word$, purpo&s;ing to &s;ue the phy&s;ician for
<PB N="280" REF="283">
fal&s;e intelligence, &s;hould the conjurer declare
that the young man was &s;ound, when the doc|tor
pronounced him di&s;ea&s;ed. But this was a
piece of &s;atisfaction he did not obtain from the
Mi&s;anthrope, who, in order to puni&s;h his &s;ordid
di&s;po&s;ition, gave him to under&s;tand, that the
phy&s;ician had told him the truth, and nothing
but the truth; and that the young gentleman was
in a fair way of attaining a comfortable old age.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That is to &s;ay (cried the client, in the impatience
of his mortification at this an&s;wer) bating acci|dents;
for, thank God, the annuitant does not
lead the mo&s;t regular l$fe: be&s;ides, I am credibly
informed he is choleric and ra&s;h; &s;o that he may
be concerned in a duel: then there are &s;uch
things as riots in the &s;treet, in which a rake's
$word$ may be ca&s;ually cracked; he may be over|turned
in a coach, over&s;et in the river, thrown
from a vicious hor&s;e, overtaken with a cold, en|dangered
by a &s;ur&s;eit; but what I place my chief
confidence in, is an hearty pox, a di&s;temper
which hath been fatal to his whole family. Not
but that the i&s;&s;ue of all the&s;e things is uncertain;
and expedients might be found, which would
more effectually an&s;wer the purpo&s;e. I know
they have arts in India, by which a man can &s;e|cure
his own intere&s;t, in the &s;alutation of a
friendly &s;hake by the hand; and I don't doubt
that you who have lived in that country, are
ma&s;ter of the &s;ecret. To be &s;ure, if you was in|cl$ned
to communicate &s;uch a no&s;trum, there are
abundance of people who would purcha&s;e it, at
a very high price.&endq;</P>
<P>Cadwallader under&s;tood this in&s;inuation, and
was tempted to amu&s;e him in &s;uch a manner as
would tend to his di&s;grace and confu&s;ion; but, con|&s;idering
<PB N="281" REF="284">
that the ca&s;e was of too criminal a nature
to be tampered with, he with&s;tood his de&s;ire of
puni&s;hing this rapacious cormorant any other
way than by telling him, he would not impart
th$t &s;ecret for his whole fortune ten times doubled;
&s;o that the u&s;urer retired, very much di&s;&s;atisfied
with the i&s;&s;ue of his con&s;ultation.</P>
<P>The next per&s;on who pre&s;ented him&s;elf at this
altar of intelligence, was an author, who recom|mended
him&s;elf to a gratis advice, by ob&s;erving
that a prophet and poet were known by the &s;ame
appellation among the antients; and that, at this
day, both the one and the other &s;poke by in&s;pi|ration.
The conjurer refu&s;ed to own this affini|ty,
which, he &s;aid, formerly &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, becau&s;e
both &s;pecies of the <HI>Vates</HI> were the children of
fiction; but as he him&s;elf did not fall under that
predicament, he begged leave to di&s;own all con|nexion
with the family of the poets; and the
poor author would have been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed without
his errand, tho' he offered to leave an ode as &s;e|curity
for the magician's &s;ee, to be paid from the
profits of his fir&s;t third night, had not Cadwalla|der's
curio&s;ity prompted him to know the &s;ubject
of this gentleman's inquiry. He therefore told
him, that in con&s;ideration of his genius, he
would for once &s;atisfy him, without a fee; and
de&s;ired him to &s;pec$fy the doubts in which he
wi&s;hed to be re&s;olved.</P>
<P>The &s;on of Parna&s;&s;us, glad of this conde&s;cen|&s;ion,
for which he thanked the necromancer,
gave him to under&s;tand, that he had &s;ome time
before pre&s;ented a play in manu&s;cript to a cer|tain
great man, at the head of ta&s;te, who had not
only read and approved the performance, but
al&s;o undertaken to introduce and &s;upport it on
<PB N="282" REF="285">
the &s;tage; that he (the author) was a&s;&s;ured by
this patron, that the play was already (in con&s;e|quence
of his recommendation) accepted by one
of the managers, who had faithfully promi&s;ed to
bring it to light; but that, when he waited on
this &s;ame manager, to know when he intended
to put his production into rehear&s;al, the man de|clared
he had never &s;een or heard of the piece:
&startq;Now, Mr. Conjurer (&s;aid he) I want to
know whether or not my play has been pre&s;ent|ed,
and if I have any &s;ort of chance of &s;eeing it
acted this winter?</P>
<P>Cadwallader, who had, in his younger days,
&s;ported among the theatrical mu&s;es, began to lo&s;e
his temp$r at this que&s;tion, which recalled the
remembr$nce of his own di&s;appointments; and
di&s;patched the author with an abrupt an&s;wer, im|porting,
that the affairs of the &s;tage were alto|gether
without the &s;phere of his d$vination, being
intirely regulated by the daemons of di&s;&s;imulation,
ignorance, and caprice.</P>
<P>It would be an endle&s;s ta&s;k to recount every
individual re&s;pon&s;e which our magician delivered,
in the cour&s;e of his conjuration. He was con|&s;ulted
in all ca&s;es of law, phy&s;ic, and trade, over
and above the ordinary &s;ubjects of marriage and
fornication; his advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance were &s;olli|cited
by &s;harpers who de&s;ired to po&s;&s;e&s;s an in&s;al|lible
method of cheating, unperceived; by for|tune-hunters
who wanted to make prize of wi|dows
and heire&s;&s;es; by debauchees who were
di&s;po&s;ed to lye with other men's wives; by cox|combs
who longed for the death of their fathers;
by wenches with child, who wi&s;hed them&s;elves
rid of their burthens; by merchants who had in|&s;ured
above value, and thir&s;ted after the news of
<PB N="283" REF="286">
a wreck; by under-writers who prayed for the
gift of pre&s;cience, that they might venture mo|ney
upon &s;uch &s;hips only, as &s;hould perform the
voyage in &s;afety; by Jews who wanted to fore|&s;ee
the fluctuations of &s;tock; by u&s;urers who ad|vance
money upon undecided cau&s;es; by clients
who were dubious of the hone&s;ty of their coun|cil:
in &s;hort, all matters of uncertain i&s;&s;ue were
appealed to this tribunal; and, in point of calcu|lation,
<HI>De Moivre</HI> was utterly neglected.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XCII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The conjurer and his a&s;&s;ociate execute a plan of ven|geance
again&s;t certain infidels who pretend to de$|pi&s;e
their art; and Peregrine atchieves an ad|venture
with a young nobleman.</HEAD>
<P>BY the&s;e means, the whole variety of cha|racter
undi&s;gui&s;ed, pa&s;&s;ed as it were in re|view
before the confederates, who, by divers in|genious
contrivances, puni&s;hed the mo&s;t flagrant
offenders with as much &s;everity as the nature of
their plan would allow. At length, they pro|jected
a &s;cheme for cha&s;ti&s;ing a number of their
own acquaintance, who had all along profe&s;&s;ed
the utmo&s;t contempt for the talents of this con|jurer,
which they endeavoured to ridicule in all
companies, where his &s;urpri&s;ing art was the &s;ub|ject
of di&s;cour&s;e; not that they had &s;en&s;e and di&s;|cernment
enough to perceive the ab&s;urdity of his
preten&s;ions, but affected a &s;ingularity of opinion,
with a view of in&s;ulting the inferior under&s;tandings
of tho&s;e who were deceived by &s;uch an idle im|po&s;tor.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="287">
Peregrine indeed, for obvious rea&s;ons, had al|ways
e&s;pou&s;ed their judgment in this ca&s;e, and
joined them in reviling the public character of
his friend; but he knew how far the capacities of
tho&s;e virtuo&s;i extended, and had frequently caught
them in the fact of recounting their exploits
again&s;t the conjurer, which were the productions
of their own invention only. On the&s;e con&s;ide|rations,
his wrath was kindled again&s;t them, and
he accordingly concerted mea&s;ures with his coad|$$tor,
for over$helming them with confu&s;ion and
di&s;may.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, a report was &s;pread by his
emi&s;&s;aries, that the magician had undertaken to
entertain the view with the appearance of any
per&s;on whom his cu&s;tomers &s;hould de&s;ire to &s;ee,
whether dead, or at the di&s;tance of a thou&s;and
leagues. This extraordinary propo&s;al chancing
to be the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation, in a place where
mo&s;t of tho&s;e infidels were a&s;&s;embled, they talked
of it in the u&s;ual &s;til$, and &s;ome of them &s;wore,
the fellow ought to be pillory'd for his pre|&s;umption.</P>
<P>Our hero &s;eizing this favourable opportunity,
acquie&s;ced in their remarks, and ob&s;erved with
great vehemence, that it would be a meritorious
action to put the ra&s;cal to the proof, and then
$o&s;s him in a blanket for non-performance. They
were wonderfully plea&s;ed with this &s;ugge&s;tion,
and forthwith determined to try the experiment;
though, as they under&s;tood the apparition would
be produced to one only at a time, they could
not immediately agree in the choice of the per&s;on
who &s;hould &s;tand the fir&s;t brunt of the magician's
&s;kill. While each of them &s;everally excu&s;ed
him&s;elf from this preference on various pretences,
<PB N="285" REF="288">
Peregrine readily undertook the po&s;t, expre&s;&s;ing
great confidence of the conjurer's incapacity to
give him the lea&s;t cau&s;e of apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>This point being &s;ettled, they detached one of
their number to Crabtree, in order to be&s;peak
and adju&s;t the hours and terms of the operation,
which he in&s;i&s;ted upon performing at his own
apartment, where every thing was prepared for
the occa&s;ion. At the appointed time, they went
thither in a body, to the number of &s;even, in full
expectation of detecting the impo&s;tor; and were
received with &s;uch gloomy formality, as &s;eemed
to have an effect upon the countenances of &s;ome
among them; though they were encouraged by
the vivacity of Pickle, who affected a double
&s;hare of petulance, for the more effectual ac|compli&s;hment
of his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Cadwallader made no reply to the interroga|tions
they uttered, in the levity of their in&s;olence,
at their fir&s;t entrance, but ordered Hadgi to con|duct
them through the next room, that they
might &s;ee there was no previous apparatus to af|$right
their deputy with objects foreign to his un|dertaking.
They found nothing but a couple of
wax-tapers burning on a table that &s;tood with a
chair by it, in the middle of the apartment, and
returned to the audience-chamber, leaving Pere|grine
by him&s;elf, to encounter the phantom of
that per&s;on, whom they &s;hould (without his
knowledge) de&s;ire the magician to conjure up to
his view.</P>
<P>All the doors being &s;hut, and the company
&s;eated, a profound &s;ilence en&s;ued, together with
a face of dreadful expectation, encouraged by
the blue flame of the candles, which were tipt
with &s;ulphur for that purpo&s;e, and heightened by
<PB N="286" REF="289">
the di&s;mal &s;ound of a large bell, which Hadgi
tolled in the anti-chamber. Cadwallader having
thus practi&s;ed upon their ignorance and fear, de|&s;ired
them to name the per&s;on to be produced;
and after &s;ome whi&s;pers among them&s;elves, one
of them took the pen, and writing the name of
commodore Trunnion upon a &s;lip of paper, put
it into the hands of the magician, who ro&s;e from
his &s;eat, and opening the door of his clo&s;et, di&s;|played
to their view a &s;cull, with thigh-bones
cro&s;&s;ed upon a table covered with black cloth.</P>
<P>This melancholy &s;pectacle made a remarkable
impre&s;&s;ion upon the imaginations of the com|pany,
already prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the previous cere|mony;
and they began to &s;urvey one another
with looks of con&s;ternation, while Cadwallader
&s;hutting him&s;elf in the clo&s;et, that was contiguous
to the chamber in which his friend Peregrin$ was
&s;tationed, thru&s;t the label with his uncle's name
through a &s;mall chink in the partition, according
to agreement, muttering all the time a &s;ort of
gibberi&s;h, that increa&s;ed the pannic of his au|dience;
then returning to his chair, the knell
was knolled again, and Pickle called aloud,
&startq;Damn your mummery, why don't you di&s;|$$$$?&endq;</P>
<P>This was a &s;ignal to Crabtree, who thus cer|$$fied
of his having received the paper, &s;tood up
and waved his wand in the figure of an S. The
motion being thrice performed, their ears were all
of a &s;udden invaded by a terrible noi&s;e in the next
room, accompanied with the voice of Peregrine,
who exclaimed in a tone of horror and amaze|ment,
&startq;Guard me, heaven! my uncle Trun|nion!&endq;
This ejaculation ha$ &s;uch an effect up|on
the hearers, that two of them &s;wooned with
<PB N="287" REF="290">
fear, a third fell upon his knees, and prayed
aloud, while the other three, in a tran&s;port of
di&s;may and di&s;traction, bur&s;t open the door, and
ru&s;hed into the haunted chamber, where they
found the table and chair overturned, and Pere|guine
extended (in all appearance) without &s;en&s;e
or motion, upon the floor.</P>
<P>They immediately began to cha&s;e his temples&punc;
and the fir&s;t &s;ymptom of his recovery, which
they perceived, was an hollow groan; after which,
he pronounced the&s;e words: &startq;Merciful powers!
if I live, I &s;aw the commodore with his black
patch, in the very cloaths he wore at my &s;i&s;ter's
wedding.&endq; This declaration compleated their
a&s;toni&s;hment and terror; they ob&s;erved a wild|ne&s;s
in his looks, which he &s;eemed to bend on
&s;omething concealed from their view; and were
infected by his appearance to &s;uch a pitch of &s;u|per&s;tition,
that it would have been an ea&s;y matter
to per&s;uade them, that the chair and table were
apparitions of their forefathers. However, they
conducted Peregrine into the council chamber,
where the conjurer and Hadgi were employed in
mini&s;tring to tho&s;e who had fainted: and the pa|tients
having retrieved the u&s;e of their faculties,
Cadwallader a&s;&s;uming a double portion of &s;everity
in his a&s;pect a&s;ked if they were not a&s;hamed of
their former incredulity; declaring, that he was
ready to give them more convincing proofs of his
art upon the &s;pot, and would immediately recal
th$ee g$$rations of their progenitors from the
dead, if they were di&s;po&s;ed to reli&s;h &s;uch com|pany.
Then turning to one of them, who&s;e
great grandfather had been hanged, &startq;Are you
($word$ he) am$$$$ous of &s;eeing the fir&s;t remarkable
$word$ of your family? Say the word; and
he &s;hall appear.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="291">
This youth, who had been the mo&s;t in&s;olent
and ob&s;treperous of the whole &s;ociety, and was
now depre&s;&s;ed with the &s;ame proportion of fear,
alarmed at the propo&s;al, a&s;&s;ured the magician, he
had no curio&s;ity of that &s;ort remaining; and that,
what he had already &s;een, would (he hoped)
have a good effect upon his future life and con|ver&s;ation.
Every one of the&s;e heroes made an
acknowledgment and profe&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame kind,
&s;ome of which were attended with tears; and
Hadgi having provided chairs for the whole com|pany,
they depa$ted exceedingly cre&s;t$ fallen; and
two of the number actually &s;ickened with the
agitation they had undergone, while our hero and
his a&s;&s;ociate made them&s;elves merry with the &s;uc|ce&s;s
of their enterprise.</P>
<P>But this &s;cheme of fortune telling did not en|gre&s;s
his whole attention; he &s;till continued to
maintain his appearance in the $eau monde; and
as his expence far exceeded his income, &s;trove to
contract intimacies with people of intere&s;t and
power: he &s;hewed him&s;elf regularly at court,
paid his re&s;pects to them in all places of public di|ver&s;ion,
and frequently entered into their parties,
either of plea&s;ure or cards. In the cour&s;e of this
cultivation, he happened one evening, at a cer|tain
chocolate-hou&s;e, to overlook a match at
piquet, in which he perceived a couple of &s;harpers
making prey of a young nobleman, who had nei|ther
temper nor &s;kill &s;ufficient to cope with &s;uch
antagoni$$s.</P>
<P>Our hero being a profe&s;&s;ed enemy to all
knights of indu&s;try, could not bear to &s;ee them
cheat in pu$lick with &s;uch in&s;olent audacity; and
therefore, under pretence of communicating &s;ome
bu&s;ine&s;s of importance, he begg'd the favour of
<PB N="289" REF="292">
&s;peaking to the young gentleman in another cor|ner
of the room, and in a friendly manner cau|tioned
him again&s;t the arts of his opponents.
This hot-headed repre&s;entative, far from thinking
or owning him&s;elf obliged to Pickle for his good
coun&s;el, looked upon the advice as an in&s;ult upon
his under&s;tanding; and replied with an air of fe|rocious
di&s;plea&s;ure, that he knew how to take
care of his own concerns, and would not &s;uffer
either him or them to bubble him out of one
&s;hilling.</P>
<P>Peregrine, offended at the a&s;&s;ociation, as well
as at the ingratitude and &s;olly of this conceited
coxcomb, expre&s;&s;ed his re&s;entment, by telling
him, that he expected at lea&s;t an acknowledge|ment
for his candid intention; but he found his
intellects too much warped by his vanity, to per|ceive
his own want of capacity and experience,
In&s;tantned by this reproof, the young nobleman
challenged him to play for five hundred pounds,
with many opprobrious, or at lea&s;t contemptuous
terms of defiance, which provoked our hero to
accept the propo&s;el; and after the other had di&s;|engaged
him&s;elf from the old rooks, who were
extremely mortified at the interruption, the two
young champions &s;at down, and fortune acting
with uncommon impartiality, Pickle, by the &s;upe|ri$rity
of his talents, in two hours won to the
amount of as many thou&s;and pounds, for which
he was obliged to take his antagoni&s;t's no$e, the
&s;harpers having previou&s;ly &s;ecured his ready money.</P>
<P>Frantic with his lo&s;s, the ra&s;h young man
would have continued the game, and doubled
flakes every time; &s;o that Peregrine might have
increa&s;ed his acqui&s;ition to ten times the &s;um he
had gained; but he thought he had already &s;uffi|ciently
<PB N="290" REF="293">
cha&s;tifed the pre&s;umption of the chal|lenger,
and was unwilling to impower fortune to
ravi&s;h from him the frui$s of his &s;ucce&s;s: he
therefore declined my lord's propo&s;al, unle&s;s he
would play for ready money; and his lord&s;hip
having in vain tried his credit among the com|pany,
our adventurer withdrew, leaving him in
an exta&s;y of rage and di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>As the in&s;olence of his behaviour had increa&s;ed
with his ill luck, and he had given vent to divers
expre&s;&s;ions, which Peregrine took ami&s;s, our
young gentleman re&s;olved to augment his puni&s;h|ment,
by teazing him with demands which could
not, he knew, be immediately &s;atisfied; and
next day, &s;ent Pipes to his father's hou&s;e with the
note, which was drawn payable upon demand.
The debtor, who had gone to bed half di&s;tracted
with his misfortune, finding him&s;elf waked with
&s;uch a di&s;agreeable dun, l$&s;t all patience, cur&s;ed
Pickle, threatened his me&s;&s;enger, bla&s;phemed
with horrible execrations, and made &s;uch a noi&s;e,
as reached the ears of his father, who ordering
his &s;on to be called into his pre&s;ence, examined
him about the cau&s;e of that uproar, which had
di&s;turbed the whole family. The young gentle|man,
after having e&s;&s;ayed to amu&s;e him with
&s;undry equivocations, which &s;erved only to in|crea&s;e
his &s;u$picion, and de&s;ire of knowing the
truth, acknowledged that he had lo&s;t &s;ome mo|ney
overnight at cards, to a gam$&s;ter, who had
been &s;o impertinent as to &s;end a me&s;&s;age, de|manding
it that morning, though he had told the
fellow, it would not &s;u$t him to pay it imme|diately.
The $ather, who was a man of honour,
repro$ched him with gre$t &s;everity $or his pro&s;li|gate
behaviour in general, and this &s;eandalous
<PB N="291" REF="294">
debt in particular, which he believed to be &s;ome
trifle, and giving him a bank note for five hun|dred
pounds, commanded him to go and di&s;|charge
it, without lo&s;s of time. This well-prin|cipled
heir took the money, but in&s;tead of waiting
upon his creditor, he forthwith repaired to the
gaming-hou&s;e, in hopes of retrieving his lo&s;s;
and before he ro&s;e from the table, &s;aw his note
mortgaged for &s;even eighths of its value.</P>
<P>Mean while, Pickle, incen&s;ed at the treatment
which his &s;ervant had received, and informed of
his lord&s;hip's &s;econd lo&s;s, which aggravated his
re&s;entment, determined to pre&s;erve no medium;
and taking out a writ that &s;ame day, put it im|mediately
in execution upon the body of his
debtor, ju&s;t as he &s;tepp'd into his chair, at the
door of White's Chocolate-hou&s;e. The pri|&s;oner
being naturally fierce and haughty, at|tempted
to draw upon the bailiffs, who di&s;armed
him in a twinkling; and this effort &s;erved only
to heighten his di&s;grace, which was witne&s;&s;ed by a
thou&s;and people, mo&s;t of whom laughed very hear|tily,
at the adventure of a lord's being arre&s;ted.</P>
<P>Such a public tran&s;action could not long e&s;cape
the knowledge of his father, who (that very day)
had the &s;atisfaction to hear that his &s;on was in a
&s;punging-hou&s;e. In con&s;equence of this informa|tion
he &s;ent his &s;teward to learn the particulars of
the arre&s;t, and was equally offended, &s;urprized,
and concerned, when he under&s;tood the nature
of the debt, which he imagined his &s;on had al|ready
di&s;charged. Unwilling to pay &s;uch a con|&s;iderable
&s;um for a &s;pendthri&s;t, whom he had but
too much indulged, and who in le&s;s than one
week might involve him&s;elf in &s;uch another dif|ficulty,
the old gentleman wrote a letter to Pe|regrine,
<PB N="292" REF="295">
repre&s;enting what a hard&s;hip it would be
upon him to forfeit &s;uch &s;ums by the indi&s;cretion
of a &s;on, who&s;e engagements he was not bound
to fulfil, and de&s;iring &s;ome mitigation in his de|mand,
as it was not a debt contracted for value
received, but incurred without &s;ubjecting him
to the lea&s;t damage or inconvenience.</P>
<P>Our adventurer no &s;ooner received this letter,
than he went in per&s;on to wait upon the author,
to whom he, in a candid manner, related the
particular circum&s;tances of the match, together
with the ingratitude and audacity of his &s;on, which
he owned had &s;timulated him to &s;uch mea&s;ures as
he, otherwi&s;e, would have &s;corned to take. The
nobleman acknowledged, that the revenge was
hardly adequate to the provocation, and con|demned
the conduct of his &s;on with &s;uch ju&s;tice
and integrity, as di&s;armed Peregrine of his re|&s;entment,
and di&s;po&s;ed him to give an undoubted
proof of his own di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, which he im|mediately
exhibited, by producing the note, and
tearing it to pieces, after having a&s;&s;ured his lord|&s;hip,
that the writ &s;hould be withdrawn, and the
pri&s;oner di&s;charged before night.</P>
<P>The earl, who perfectly well under&s;tood the
value of money, and was no &s;tranger to the cha|racters
of mankind, &s;tood amazed at this &s;acrifice
which Pickle prote&s;ted was offered by his e&s;teem
for his lord&s;hip; and after having complimented
him upon his genero&s;ity, in a very uncommon
&s;train of encomium, begg'd the favour of his ac|quaintance,
and in&s;i&s;ted upon his dining wi$h him
next day. The youth, proud of having met
with &s;uch an opportunity to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf,
in le&s;s than an hour performed every article of his
promi&s;e; and in the morning was vi&s;ited by the
<PB N="293" REF="296">
debtor, who came, by the expre&s;s order of his
father, to thank him for the obligation under
which he was laid, and a&s;k pardon for the offence
he had given.</P>
<P>This conde&s;cen&s;ion was very glorious for our
hero, who graciou&s;ly received his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion,
and accompanied him to dinner, where he was
care&s;&s;ed by the old earl with marks of particular
affection and e&s;teem. Nor was his gratitude con|$$$ed
to exterior civility; he offered him the u&s;e
of his intere&s;t at court, which was very power|ful,
and repeated his de&s;ire of &s;erving him &s;o
pre&s;&s;ingly, that Peregrine thought he could not
di&s;pen&s;e with the opportunity of a&s;&s;i&s;ting his ab|&s;ent
friend God$rey, in who&s;e behalf he begg'd
the influence of his lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>The earl, plea&s;ed with this reque&s;t, which
was another proof of the young gentleman's be|nevolence,
&s;aid, he would not fail to pay the ut|mo&s;t
regard to his recommendation; and in &s;ix
weeks a captain$s commi&s;&s;ion was actually &s;igned
for the brother of Emilia, who was very agreeably
&s;urprized at the intimation he received from the
war-office, though he was utterly ignorant of the
canal through which he obtained that promotion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XCIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine is celebrated as a wit and patron, and
proceeds to entertain him&s;elf at the expence of
whom it did concern.</HEAD>
<P>IN the mean time, Peregrine flouri&s;hed in the
gay &s;cenes of life, and (as I have already
ob&s;erved) had divers opportunities of profiting in
the way of marriage, had not his ambition been
<PB N="294" REF="297">
a little too inordinate, and his heart &s;till bia&s;&s;ed
by a pa&s;&s;ion, which all the levity of youth could
not balance, nor all the pride of vanity overcome.
Nor was our hero unmarked in the world of let|ters
and ta&s;te: he had &s;ignalized him&s;elf in &s;e|veral
poetical productions, by which he had ac|quired
a good &s;hare of reputation; not that the
pieces were &s;uch as ought to have done much ho|nour
to his genius; but any tolerable perfor|mance
from a per&s;on of his figure and &s;uppo&s;ed
fortune, will always be con&s;idered, by the bulk of
readers, as an in&s;tance of a&s;toni&s;hing capacity;
though the very &s;ame production, u&s;hered into
the world with the name of an author in le&s;s
affluent circum&s;tances, would be ju&s;tly di&s;regarded
and de&s;pi&s;ed; &s;o much is the opinion of mo&s;t peo|ple
influenced and over-awed by ridiculous con|&s;iderations.</P>
<P>Be this as it will, our young gentleman was no
&s;ooner di&s;tingui&s;hed as an author, than he was
marked out as a patron, by all the &s;tarving retainers
to poetry: he was &s;olemnized in odes, celebrated
in epigrams, and fed with the milk of &s;oft dedica|tion.
His vanity even reli&s;hed this incen&s;e; a$d
though his rea&s;on could not help de&s;pi&s;ing tho&s;e
that offered it, not one of them was &s;ent away,
unowned by his muni$icence. He began to think
him&s;elf, in good earne&s;t, that &s;uperior genius
which their flattery had de&s;cribed; he cultivated
acquaintance with the wits of fa&s;hion, and even
compo&s;ed in &s;ecret a number of <HI>b$ns mots,</HI> which
he uttered in company as the impromptu's of his
imagination. In this practice indeed, he imitated
&s;ome of the mo&s;t renowned geniu&s;es of the age,
who (if the truth were known) have l$boured in
&s;ecret, with the &s;weat of their brows, for many a
<PB N="295" REF="298">
repartee which they have vended as the imme|diate
production of fancy and expre&s;&s;ion. He was
&s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in this exerci&s;e of his talents, that
his &s;ame actually came in competition with that of
a great man, who had long &s;at at the helm of
wit; and in a dialogue that once happened be|tween
them, on the &s;ubject of a cork-&s;crew,
wherein the altercation was di&s;charged (according
to Bayes) &s;lap for &s;lap, da&s;h for da&s;h, our hero
was judged to have the better of his lord&s;hip, by
&s;ome of the minor &s;atellites, that commonly &s;ur|round
and reflect the rays of &s;uch mighty lumi|naries.</P>
<P>In a word, he dipped him&s;elf &s;o far in the&s;e li|terary
amu&s;ements, that he took the management
of the pit into his direction, putting him&s;elf at
the head of tho&s;e critics who call them&s;elves the
town; and in that capacity cha&s;ti&s;ed &s;everal play|ers,
who had been rendered in&s;olent and refrac|tory
by unmerited &s;ucce&s;s. As for the new pro|ductions
of the &s;tage, though generally un&s;pirited
and in&s;ipid, they always enjoyed the benefit of his
influence and protection; becau&s;e he never di&s;liked
the performance &s;o much as he &s;ympathized with
the poor author, who &s;tood behind the &s;cenes in
the mo&s;t dreadful &s;u&s;pence, trembling, as it were,
on the very brink of damnation: yet, though he
extended his genero&s;ity and compa&s;&s;ion to the
humble and needy, he never let &s;lip one oppor|tunity
of mortifying villainy and arrogance. Had
the executive power of the legi&s;lature been ve&s;ted
in him, he would have doubtle&s;s devi&s;ed &s;trange
&s;pecies of puni&s;hment for all offenders again&s;t hu|manity
and decorum; but, re&s;tricted as he was,
he employed his invention in &s;ubjecting them to
the ridicule and contempt of their fellow &s;ubjects.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="299">
It was with that view he &s;et on foot the &s;cheme
of conjuration, which was &s;till happily carried on,
and made u&s;e of the intelligence of his friend
Cadwallader; though he &s;ometimes converted this
advantage to the purpo&s;es of gallantry, being (as
the reader may have perceived) of a very amorous
complexion. He not only acted the re$ormer, or
rather the ca&s;tigator, in the fa&s;hionable world, but
al&s;o exerci&s;ed his talents among the inferior cla&s;s
of people, who chanced to incur his di$&s;pl$ a&s;ure.</P>
<P>Being one day in&s;ulted by a couple of chair|men,
who demanded more than their fare, he
took particular notice of their number; and next
day, Pipes, being dre&s;&s;ed in one of his old &s;uits,
went by his direction to a coffee-hou&s;e near their
&s;tand, after he had loaded him&s;elf with an addi|tional
weight, amounting to an hundred pounds
at lea&s;t; and calling the &s;ame individual partners
who had affronted his ma&s;ter, he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of their chair, and ordered them to carry him to
a place at the di&s;tance of two long miles. The
burthen was &s;o extraordinary, that when they at|tempted
to take him up, they imag$ ned the ve|hicle
was detained by &s;ome crack or crevice of the
pavement, and one of them actually went to di&s;en|gage
it; but finding it clear, he began a &s;ong of
imprecations upon his fare, who he &s;wore had got
a back&s;ide of block-tin; but, being obliged to ac|compli&s;h
his undertaking, he bent his &s;houlders
once more to the lead, bidding his comrade lift
fair and be damn'd. The ta&s;k was not performed
in &s;ilence; while they &s;taggered along, he cur&s;ed
in a &s;train peculiar to him&s;elf, and in vain ende$|voured
to provoke the patient Pipes with oppro|brious
language, hoping that he would either di&s;|mi&s;s
them from his &s;ervice, or be &s;o incen&s;ed at
<PB N="297" REF="300">
his abu&s;e, as to proceed to manual cha&s;ti&s;ement;
in which ca&s;e, the fellow would have an oppor|tunity
of gratifying his choler upon the author of
his pre&s;ent grievance. Finding, however, that
the gentleman bore his reproaches with the mo&s;t
philo&s;ophic indifference, he lo&s;t all patience; and
being re&s;trained, by the fear of the law, from an
a&s;&s;ault upon his fare, he turned the &s;tream of his
indignation upon his own partner, who, he al|ledged,
did not bear his &s;hare of the burthen.
This imputation created a di&s;pute, which was
maintained on both &s;ides with &s;uch virulence of
obloquy, as produced a quarrel, and mutual de|fiance
to &s;ingle combat, on the &s;pot.</P>
<P>The chair was accordingly &s;et down, without
ceremony, the antagoni&s;ts &s;tripped them&s;elves in
a moment; and a fierce battle en&s;uing, Peregrine,
who followed at a di&s;tance, enjoyed the plea&s;ure
of &s;eeing them both beaten almo&s;t to jelly, be|fore
the conte&s;t was determined. As for Pipes,
he &s;at &s;till, and viewed the engagement with great
compo&s;ure; and perceiving his carriers di&s;abled
by their mutual prowe&s;s and per&s;everance, opened
the chair, and very de$iberately walked home to
his ma&s;ter's lodging, where he di&s;incumbered him|&s;elf
of his load.</P>
<P>A few days after the atchievement of this ex|ploit,
one of our hero's friends, who lodged at
the hou&s;e of an old peevi&s;h puritanical widow,
that kept an ho&s;ier's &s;hop, was obl$g$d to quit
his apartment at a minute's warning, becau&s;e he
had &s;candal$zed the hou&s;e, by treating a female
co$&s;in at &s;upper over-night. On this occa&s;ion, a
great deal of &s;harp repartee had pa&s;&s;ed between
him and his landlady, who not only &s;ubjected him
to infinite inconvenience, from &s;uch a precipitate
<PB N="298" REF="301">
removal, but had likewi&s;e given her tongue &s;uch
di&s;agreeable liberties, at his expence, that he
vowed revenge, and now &s;ollicited the advice and
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his friend. Pickle having inquired
into the character of the delinquent, who was
hated by her neighbours, for her in&s;olent and
fretful di&s;po&s;ition, undertook the cau&s;e of his com|panion,
to whom he dictated the following adver|ti&s;ement,
which was immediately in&s;erted in one
of the news-papers: &startq;Any per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a
male black cat, with white feet, and a b$$$y tail,
not exceeding the age of two or three years, will
find a purcha&s;er, by carrying it to the &s;ign of the
kid near St. James's.&endq;</P>
<P>The projector and his a&s;&s;ociate having obtained
the promi&s;e of the publi&s;her, that this intimation
&s;hould appear next day, went early in the morn|ing
to a public hou&s;e, and occupying a room,
the windows of which fronted the ho&s;ier's door,
&s;at with joyful expectation to &s;ee the effect of
their &s;cheme, which &s;oon yielded them all the &s;a|tisfaction
they could de&s;ire. The &s;hop was no
&s;ooner opened, than it was &s;urrounded by a great
number of the Cannaille, who having heard the
adverti&s;ement read in ale-hou&s;es, came (each with
a cat under his arm) in hopes of making an ad|vantageous
bargain; for though many of them
were too incon&s;iderable to produce &s;uch an ani|mal
of their own property, they had made free
with the fir&s;t cats they could pick up, and every
one repair$d with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch to the ap|pointed
place, with a view of fore&s;ta$$ing the
market; &s;o that, in di&s;puting the precedence, the
whole crew went to loggerheads about the door,
to the utter a&s;toni&s;hment of the &s;hopkeeper, who
could not conceive the meaning of &s;uch a congre|g$tion.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="302">
Neverthele&s;s, &s;he began to harangue them in
her u&s;ual &s;tile, which was not the milde&s;t &s;ort of
expo&s;tulation; and one of the multitude, who
found means to detach him&s;elf from the general
uproar and confu&s;ion, told her, he had brought
a cat, which, he &s;uppo&s;ed, would an&s;wer the
marks of her adverti&s;ement. &startq;Here, (&s;aid he,
pre&s;enting the creature) look at him, mi&s;tre&s;s;
I'll be damn'd if you ever &s;aw a finer boar in
your life. Do but mind his tu$$$s and his ta$l;
his tail is for all the world like a &s;quirrel's, and
yet he's no more than a kitten; I'm the &s;on of a
bitch, if he's a day more than &s;ix months old.&endq;
This addre&s;s, while it compleated her amaze|ment,
ki$dled her rage to &s;uch a degre$, that &s;he
&s;pit in his $ace, calling him a cat, and a rat, and
a ra&s;cal; and &s;hutting the hatch, threatened the
whole a&s;&s;embly with Br$dewell and impri&s;onment,
if they would not immediately di&s;per&s;e. Her de|clamation
was &s;o &s;hr$ll, as to command the at|tention
of the whole audience, who finding their
hopes fru&s;trated, and hearing them&s;elves &s;o bit|terly
reviled, put an end to their own jars, and
held a momentary conference; in con&s;equence of
which, one of them was deputed to a&s;k, whether
or not &s;he had adverti&s;ed for a black cat. This
que&s;tion being an&s;wered in the negative, with a
&s;tring of reproachful epithets, the interrogator ap|proaching
the do$r, &startq;Why, ye bitch of B$bel$
(&s;aid he) if you won't give m$ney for my ca$,
you &s;hall have him for love.&endq; With tho&s;e words
he threw it into the &s;hop, and retired; while his
brethren, in obedience to this &s;ignal, lifted up
their hands as one man, and like &s;oldiers at the
word of command, di&s;charged about forty cats at
the &s;ame in&s;tant of time, upon the con$$$$$d
<PB N="300" REF="303">
ho&s;ier, who finding her&s;elf overwhelmed by &s;uch
a number of animals, which &s;he looked upon as
&s;o many fiends &s;ent to torment her, ran agha&s;t into
the &s;treet with di&s;mal outcries, imploring the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance
of her neighbours, who (as well as our
confederates) enjoyed her di&s;tre&s;s; and after hav|ing
indulged their animo&s;ity, contributed their aid,
in ridding her of &s;uch a dangerous annoyance.</P>
<P>The next mi&s;chievous plan that entered our
hero's imagination, was &s;ugge&s;ted by two adver|ti&s;ements
publi&s;hed in the &s;ame paper, by per&s;ons
who wanted to borrow certain &s;ums of money,
for which they promi&s;ed to give undeniable &s;ecu|rity.
Peregrine, from the &s;tile and manner of
both, concluded they were written by attornies,
a &s;pecies of people for whom he entertained his
uncle's aver&s;ion: and in order to amu&s;e him&s;elf,
and &s;ome of his friends, with their di&s;appoint|ment,
he wrote a letter &s;igned A. B. to each ad|verti&s;er,
according to the addre&s;s &s;pecified in the
news-paper, importing, that if he would come
with his writings, to a certain coffee-hou&s;e near
the Temple, preci&s;ely at &s;ix o'clock in the even|ing,
he would find a per&s;on &s;itting in the right-hand
box, next to the window, who would be
glad to treat with him about the &s;ubject of his ad|verti&s;ement,
and, &s;hould his &s;ecurity be liked,
would accommodate him with the &s;um which he
wanted to rai&s;e. Before the hour of this double
appointment, Pickle with his friend Cadwallader,
and a few more gentlemen, to whom he had
thought proper to communicate the plan, went to
the coffee-hou&s;e, and &s;eated them&s;elves near the
place that was de&s;tined for their meeting.</P>
<P>The hope of getting money had &s;uch an evident
effect upon their punctuality, that one of them
<PB N="301" REF="304">
arrived a con&s;iderable time before the hour; and
having reconnoitred the room, took his &s;tation
according to the direction he had received, fixing
his eye upon a clock that &s;tood before him, and
a&s;king of the bar-keeper if it was not too &s;low. He
had not remained in this po&s;ture many minutes,
when he was joined by a &s;trange figure, that
waddled into the room, with a bundle of papers in
his bo&s;om, and the &s;weat running over his no&s;e.
Seeing a man in the box to which he had been
directed, he took it for granted he was the lender;
and as &s;oon as he could recover his breath, which
was almo&s;t exhau&s;ted by the di&s;patch he had made,
&startq;Sir, (&s;aid he) I pre&s;ume you are the gentleman
I was to meet, about that loan.&endq;&mdash;Here he
was interrupted by the other, who eagerly re|plied,
&startq;A. B. Sir, I &s;uppo&s;e.&endq; &startq;The &s;ame,
(cried the la&s;t comer) I was afraid I &s;hould be
too late; for I was detained beyond my expecta|tion,
by a nobleman in the other end of the
town, that wants to mortgage a &s;mall trifle of his
e&s;tate, about a thou&s;and a year; and my watch
happens to be in the hands of the maker, having
met with an accident a few nights ago, which &s;et
it a&s;leep. But how&s;omever, there's no time lo&s;t,
and I hope this affair will be tran&s;acted to the &s;a|tisfaction
of us both. For my own part, I love
to do good offices my&s;elf, and therefore I expect
nothing but what is fair and hone&s;t of other
people.&endq;</P>
<P>His new friend was exceedingly comforted by
this declarati$n, which he con&s;idered as a happy
omen of his &s;ucce&s;s; and the hope of fingering
the ca&s;h operated vi&s;ibly in his countenance,
while he expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction at meeting with
a per&s;on of &s;uch candour and humanity. &startq;The
<PB N="302" REF="305">
plea&s;ure (&s;aid he) of dealing with an ea&s;y con&s;cien|tious
man, is, in my opinion, &s;uperior to that of
touching all the money upon earth; for what joy
can be compared with what a generous mind
feels, in bef$iending its fellow-creatures? I was
never &s;o happy in my life, as at one time, in
lending five hundred pounds to a worthy gentleman
in di&s;tre&s;s, without in&s;i&s;ting upon rigid &s;ecurity.
Sir, one may ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h an upright man by
his countenance; for example now, I think I
could take your word for ten thou&s;and pounds.&endq;
The other with great joy prote&s;ted, that he was
right in his conjecture, and returned the compli|ment
a thou&s;and fold: by which means, the ex|pectation
of both was wound up to a very inter|e&s;ting
pitch; and both, at the &s;ame in&s;tant, be|gan
to produce their papers, in the un$ying of
which, their hands &s;hook with tran&s;ports of ea|gerne&s;s
and impatience; while their eyes were &s;o
intent upon their work, that they did not per|ceive
the occupation of each other.</P>
<P>At length, one of them, ha$ing got the &s;tart
of the other, and unrolled &s;everal &s;kins of mu&s;ty
$ar$hment, directed his view to the employment
of his friend; and &s;eeing him fumbling at his
bundle, a&s;ked if that was a blank bond and con|veyance,
which he had brought along with him.
The other, without lifting up his eyes, or de|&s;i&s;ting
from his endeavours to loo&s;e the knot,
which by this time he had applied to his teeth,
an&s;wered this que&s;tion in the negative, ob&s;erving,
that the papers in his hand were the &s;ecurity which
he propo&s;ed to give for the money.</P>
<P>This reply converted the looks of the inquirer
into a &s;tare of infini$e &s;tolidity, accompanied with
the word, <HI>Anan!</HI> which he pronounced in a t$ne
<PB N="303" REF="306">
of fear and a&s;toni&s;hment. The other, alarmed
at this note, ca&s;t his eyes towards the &s;uppo&s;ed
lender, and was in a moment infected by his a&s;|pect.
All the exultation of hope that &s;parkled in
their eyes, was now &s;ucceeded by di&s;appointment
and di&s;may; and while they gazed ruefully at
each other, their features were gradually elon|gated,
like the tran&s;ient curls of a Middle-row
periwig.</P>
<P>This emphatic &s;ilence was, however, broke
by the la&s;t comer, who, in a faultering accent,
de&s;ired the other to recollect the contents of his
letter. &startq;Of your letter!&endq; cried the fir&s;t, putting
into his hand the adverti&s;ement he had received
from Pickle; which he had no &s;ooner peru&s;ed,
than he produced his own, for the &s;atisfaction of
the other party: &s;o that another gloomy pau&s;e
en&s;ued, at the end of which, each uttered a pro|found
&s;igh, or rather groan, and ri&s;ing up, &s;neak'd
off, without farther communication; he who
&s;eemed to be the mo&s;t afflicted of the two, taking
his departure, with an exclamation of &startq;Hum|bugged,
egad!&endq;</P>
<P>Such were the amu&s;ements of our hero, tho'
they did not engro&s;s his whole time, &s;ome part
of which was dedicated to nocturnal riots and re|vels,
among a &s;et of young noblemen, who had
denounced war again&s;t temperance, oeconomy,
and common &s;en&s;e, and were indeed the devoted
&s;ons of tumult, wa&s;te, and prodigality. Not
that Peregr$$e reli&s;hed tho&s;e &s;cenes, which were
a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ab&s;urd extravagance, devoid of a$$
true &s;pirit, ta&s;te, or enjoyment: but his vanity
prompted him to mingle with tho&s;e who were
intitled the choice &s;pirits of the age; and his di&s;|po&s;ition
was &s;o pliable, as to ad$pt it&s;elf ea&s;ily to
<PB N="204" REF="307">
the mea&s;ures of his company, where he had not
influence enough to act in the capacity of director.
Their rendezvous was at a certain tavern, which
might be properly &s;tiled the temple of exce&s;s,
where they left the choice of their fare to the
di&s;cretion of the landlord, that they might &s;ave
them&s;elves the pains of exerci&s;ing their own rea|&s;on;
and, in order to avoid the trouble of ad|ju&s;ting
the bill, ordered the waiter to declare how
much every individual mu&s;t pay, without &s;peci|fying
the articles of the charge; and this propor|tion
generally amounted to two guineas <HI>per</HI> head
for each dinner and &s;upper, and frequently ex|ceeded
that &s;um; of which the landlord dur&s;t
not abate, without running the ri&s;que of having
his no&s;e &s;lit for his moderation.</P>
<P>But this was a puny expence, compared with
that which they often incurred, by the damage
done to the furniture and &s;ervants, in the mad|ne&s;s
of their intoxication, as well as the lo&s;s they
&s;u&s;tained at hazard, an amu&s;ement to which all
of them had recour&s;e, in the progre&s;s of their
debauches. This elegant diver&s;ion was intro|duced,
encouraged, and promoted by a crew of
rapacious &s;harpers, who had made them&s;elves ne|ce&s;&s;ary
companions to this hopeful generation,
by the talents of pimping and buffoonery: and
though they were univer&s;ally known, even by
tho&s;e they preyed upon, to have no other means
of earning their livelihood, than the mo&s;t in|famous
and fraudulent practices, they were ca|re&s;&s;ed
and cou$ted by the&s;e infatuated dupes, when
a man of honour, who would not join in their
exce&s;&s;es, would have been treated with the ut|mo&s;t
indignity and contempt.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="308">
Though Peregrine, in his heart, dete&s;ted tho&s;e
abandoned cour&s;es, and was a profe&s;&s;ed enemy to
the whole &s;ociety of game&s;ters, whom he con|&s;idered,
and always treated as the foes of human
kind, he was in&s;en&s;ibly accu&s;tomed to licentious
riot, and even led imperceptibly into play by
tho&s;e cormorants, who are no le&s;s dangerous in
the art of cheating, than by their con&s;ummate
&s;kill in working upon the pa&s;&s;ions of unwary
youth. They are, for the mo&s;t part, naturally
cool, phlegmatic and cra$ty, and by a long habit
of di&s;&s;imulation, have gained an ab&s;olute domi|nion
over the ha&s;ty pa&s;&s;ions of the heart; &s;o that
they engage with manife&s;t advantage over the im|patience
and impetuo&s;ity of a warm, unde&s;igning
temper, like that of our young gentleman, who,
when he was heated with wine, mi&s;led by ex|ample,
invited on one hand, and defied on the
other, forgot all his maxims of caution and &s;o|briety,
and plunging into the reigning folly of
the place, had frequent occa&s;ions to moralize in the
morning, upon the lo&s;s of the preceding night.</P>
<P>The&s;e penitential reflections were attended with
many laudable re&s;olutions of profiting by the ex|pence
which he had &s;o dearly purcha&s;ed; but he
was one of tho&s;e philo&s;ophers, who always put
off, till another day, the commencement of their
reformation.</P>
