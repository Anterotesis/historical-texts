<SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM obliged to your lord&s;hip for your commu|nication of the heads of Mr. Gr&mdash;r's bill. I had received it in an earlier &s;tage of it's progre&s;s, from Mr. Br-gh-ll; and I am &s;till in that gentleman's debt, as I have not made him the proper return for the favour he has done me. Bu&s;ine&s;s, to which I was more immediately called, and in which my &s;enti|ments had the weight of one vote, occupied me every moment, &s;ince I received his letter. This fir&s;t morning, which I can call my own, I give with great chearfulne&s;s to the &s;ubject, on which your lord&s;hip has done me the honour of de&s;iring my opinion. I have read the heads of the bill,
<PB N="4" REF="3">
with the amendments. Your lord&s;hip is too well acquainted with men, and with affairs, to ima|gine that any true judgment can be formed on the value of a great mea&s;ure of policy, from the pe|ru&s;al of a piece of paper. At pre&s;ent I am much in the dark, with regard to the &s;tate of the country, which the intended law is to be applied to. It is not ea&s;y for me to determine whether or no it was wi&s;e (for the &s;ake of expunging the black letter of laws, which, menacing as they were in the language, were every day fading into di&s;u&s;e) &s;olemnly to re|affirm the principles, and to re-enact the provi&s;ions of a code of &s;tatutes, by which you are totally ex|cluded from THE PRIVILEGES OF THE COMMON-WEALTH, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, from the mo&s;t material of the civil profe&s;&s;ions, from the army, and even from education, where alone, edu|cation is to be had. Whether this &s;cheme of indul|gence, grounded at once on contempt and jealou&s;y, has a tendency gradually to produce &s;omething better and more liberal, I cannot tell, for want of having the actual map of the country. If this &s;hould be the ca&s;e, it was right in you to accept it, &s;uch as it is. But if this &s;hould be one of the experiments, which have &s;ometimes been made, before the tem|per of the nation was ripe for a real reformation, I think it may po&s;&s;ibly have ill effects, by di&s;po&s;ing the penal matter in a more &s;y&s;tematic order, and there|by fixing a permanent bar again&s;t any thing that is truly &s;ub&s;tantial. The whole merit or demerit of the mea&s;ure depends upon the plans and di&s;po&s;itions of
<PB N="5" REF="4">
tho&s;e by whom the act was made, concurring with the general temper of the prote&s;tants of Ireland, and their aptitude to admit in time of &s;ome part of that equality, without which you never can be FELLOW CITIZENS.&mdash;Of all this I am wholly ignorant. All my corre&s;pondence with men of public importance, in Ireland, has for &s;ome time totally cea&s;ed. On the fir&s;t bill for the relief of the Roman Catholics of Ireland, I was, without any call of mine, con&s;ulted both on your &s;ide of the water and on this. On the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, I have not heard a word from any man in office; and know as little of the intentions of the Briti&s;h govern|ment, as I know of the temper of the Iri&s;h parlia|ment. Your lord&s;hip mentions that oppo&s;ition is expected from the archbi&s;hop of C&mdash;ll. If I am rightly informed, he has obtained that high and lu|crative office under the crown, by the credit of his uncle, Mr. E&mdash;who has him&s;elf an high and tolerably profitable office under the king, and has been for many years con&s;tantly in &s;uch offices; and, I am told, looks to the peerage. Oppo&s;ition, too, is hinted from other per&s;ons, who hold great places and have multiplied great emoluments under government. I do not find that any oppo&s;ition was made by the principal per&s;ons, of the minority in the hou&s;e of Commons, or that any is apprehended from them in the hou&s;e of Lords. The whole of the difficulty &s;eems to lie with the principal men in government under who&s;e protection this bill is &s;uppo&s;ed to be brought in. This violent oppo&s;ition and cordial
<PB N="6" REF="5">
&s;upport, coming from one and the &s;ame quarter, appears to me &s;omething my&s;terious, and hin|ders me from being able to make any clear judg|ment of the merit of the pre&s;ent mea&s;ure, as com|pared with the actual &s;tate of the country, and the general views of government, without which one can &s;ay nothing that may not be very erroneous.</P>
<P>To look at the Bill, in the ab&s;tract, it is neither more or le&s;s than a renewed act of UNIVERSAL, UNMITIGATED, INDISPENSABLE, EXCEPTION|LESS DISQUALIFICATION.</P>
<P>One would imagine, that a Bill, inflicting &s;uch a multitude of incapacities, had followed on the heels of a conque&s;t, made by a very fierce ene|my, under the impre&s;&s;ion of recent animo&s;ity and re&s;entment. No man, on reading that bill, could imagine he was reading an act of amne&s;ty and in|dulgence, following a recital of the good behaviour of tho&s;e who are the objects of it; which recital &s;tood at the head of the bill, as it was fir&s;t intro|duced: but, I &s;uppo&s;e for its incongruity with the body of the piece, was afterwards omitted.&mdash;This I &s;ay on memory. It however &s;till recites the oath, and that catholics ought to be con&s;idered as good and loyal &s;ubjects to his maje&s;ty, his crown and government. Then follows an univer&s;al exclu&s;ion of tho&s;e GOOD and LOYAL &s;ubjects from every (even the lowe&s;t) office of tru&s;t and profit; from any vote at an election; from any privilege in a town corporate; from being even a freeman of &s;uch corporations; from &s;erving on grand juries; from
<PB N="7" REF="6">
a vote at a ve&s;try; from having a gun in his hou&s;e, from being a Barri&s;ter, Attorney, or Solicitor, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>This has &s;urely a much more the air of a Table of pro&s;cription, than an act of grace. What mu&s;t we &s;uppo&s;e the laws, concerning tho&s;e good &s;ubjects, to have been, of which this is a relaxation? I know well that there is a cant current, about the difference between an exclu&s;ion from employments even to the mo&s;t rigorous extent, and an exclu&s;ion from the natural benefits ari&s;ing from a man's own indu&s;try. I allow, that under &s;ome circum&s;tances, the differ|ence is very material in point of ju&s;tice, and that there are con&s;iderations which may render it advi&s;eable for a wi&s;e government to keep the leading parts of every branch, of civil and military admini&s;tration in hands of the be&s;t tru&s;t: But a total exclu&s;ion from the common-wealth is a very different thing. When a govern|ment &s;ub&s;i&s;ts (as governments formerly did) on an e&s;tate of its own, with but few and incon&s;iderable revenues drawn from the &s;ubject, then the few of|ficers which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, were naturally at the di&s;po|&s;al of tho&s;e who paid the &s;alaries out of their own pockets, and there an exclu&s;ive preference could hardly merit the name of pro&s;cription: almo&s;t the whole produce of a man's indu&s;try remained in his own pur&s;e to maintain his family. When a very great portion of the labour of individuals goes to the &s;tate, and is by the &s;tate again refunded to indi|viduals, thro' the medium of offices, and in
<PB N="8" REF="7">
this circuitous progre&s;s from the public to the private fund, indemnifies the families from whom it is taken, an equitable balance between the go|vernment and the &s;ubject is e&s;tabli&s;hed. But if a great body of the people who contribute to this &s;tate lottery, are excluded from all the prizes, the &s;topping the circulation with regard to them, may be a mo&s;t cruel hard&s;hip, amounting in effect to be|ing double and treble taxed, and will be felt as &s;uch to the very quick by all the families high and low of tho&s;e hundreds of thou&s;ands, who are deni|ed their chance in the returned fruits of their own indu&s;try. This is the thing meant by tho&s;e who look upon the public revenue only as a &s;poil; and will naturally wi&s;h to have as few as po&s;&s;ible concerned in the divi&s;ion of the booty. If a &s;tate &s;hould be &s;o unhappy as to think it cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without &s;uch a barbarous pro&s;cription, the per&s;ons &s;o pro&s;cribed ought to be indemnified by the remi&s;&s;ion of a large part of their taxes, by an immunity from the offices of public burden, and by an exemption from being pre&s;&s;ed into any military or naval &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Common &s;en&s;e and common ju&s;tice dictate this at lea&s;t, as &s;ome &s;ort of compen&s;ation for their &s;lavery. How many families are incapable of ex|i&s;ting, if the little offices of the revenue, and lit|tle military commi&s;&s;ions are denied them? To deny them at home, and to make the happine&s;s of acquiring &s;ome of them &s;omewhere el&s;e, felony, or high trea&s;on, is a piece of cruelty, in which till very lately I did not &s;uppo&s;e this age capable of per&s;i&s;ting. Formerly a &s;imilarity of religion
<PB N="9" REF="8">
made a &s;ort of country for a man in &s;ome quarter or other. A refugee for religion was a protected character. Now, the reception is cold indeed: and therefore as the a&s;ylum abroad is de&s;troyed, the hard&s;hip at home is doubled. This hard&s;hip is the more intolerable becau&s;e the profe&s;&s;ions are &s;hut up. The church is &s;o of cour&s;e. Much is to be &s;aid on that &s;ubject, in regard to them, and to the prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters. But that is a chapter by it&s;elf. I am &s;ure I wi&s;h well to that church, and think it's mini&s;ters among the very be&s;t citizens of your country. However &s;uch as it is, a great walk in life is forbidden ground to &s;eventeen hundred thou|&s;and of the inhabitants of Ireland. Why are they ex|cluded from the law? Do not they expend money in their &s;uits? Why may not they indemnify them|&s;elves, by profiting, in the per&s;ons of &s;ome, for the lo&s;&s;es incurred by others? Why may not they have per&s;ons of confidence, whom they may, if they plea&s;e, employ in the agency of their affairs? The exclu&s;ion from the law, from grand juries, from &s;heriff|&s;hips, and under&s;heriffships, as well as from free|dom in any corporation, may &s;ubject them to dreadful hard&s;hips, as it may exclude them wholly from all that is beneficial, and expo&s;e them to all that is mi&s;chievous in a trial by jury. This was manife&s;tly within my own ob&s;ervation, for I was three times in Ireland from the year 1760 to the year 1767, where I had &s;ufficient means of information, concerning the inhuman proceedings (among which were many cruel murders, be&s;ides an infinity
<PB N="10" REF="9">
of outrages and oppre&s;&s;ions, unknown before in a civilized age) which prevailed during that period in con&s;equence of a pretended con|&s;piracy among roman catholics again&s;t the king's government, I could dilate upon the mi&s;|chiefs that may happen, from tho&s;e which have hap|pened, upon this head of di&s;qualification, if it were at all nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>THE head of exclu&s;ion from votes for members of parliament is clo&s;ely connected with the former. When you ca&s;t your eye ou the &s;tatute book, you will &s;ee that no catholic, even in the ferocjous act of queen Anne, was di&s;abled from voting, on account of his religion. The only conditions re|quired for that privilege, were the oaths of allegi|ance and adjuration&mdash;both oaths relative to a civil concern. Parliament has &s;ince added another oath of the &s;ame kind: and yet an hou&s;e of commons adding to the &s;ecurities of government, in propor|tion as its danger is confe&s;&s;edly le&s;&s;ened, and profe&s;|&s;ing both confidence and indulgence, in effect takes away the privilege left by an act full of jealou&s;y, and profe&s;&s;ing per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>The taking away of a vote is the taking away the &s;hield which the &s;ubject has, not only again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ion of power, but that wor&s;t of all op|pre&s;&s;ions, the per&s;ecution of private &s;ociety, and private manners. No candidate for parliamentary influence is obliged to the lea&s;t attention towards them, either in cities or counties. On the contrary, if they &s;hould become obnoxious to any bigotted or malignant people among&s;t whom
<PB N="11" REF="10">
they live, it will become the intere&s;t of tho&s;e who court popular favour, to u&s;e the numberle&s;s means which always re&s;ide in magi&s;tra|cy and influence, to oppre&s;s them. The proceed|ings in a certain county in Mun&s;ter, during the un|fortunate period I have mentioned, read a &s;trong lec|ture on the cruelty of depriving men of that &s;hield, on account of their &s;peculative opinions. The prote&s;|tants of Ireland feel well and naturally on the hard|&s;hip of being bound by laws in the enacting of which they do not directly or indirectly vote. The bounds of the&s;e matters are nice, and hard to be &s;ettled in theory, and perhaps they have been pu&s;hed too far. But how they can avoid the nece&s;|&s;ary application in the ca&s;e of others towards them, I know not.</P>
<P>It is true, the words of this act do not create a di&s;ability; but they clearly and evidently &s;uppo&s;e it. There are few catholic freeholders to take the benefit of the privilege, if they were permitted to partake it; but the manner in which this very right in freeholders at large is defended, is not on the idea that they do really and truly repre&s;ent the people; but that all people being capable of obtaining free|holds, all tho&s;e, who, by their indu&s;try and &s;obrie|ty merit this privilege, have the means of arriving at votes. It is the &s;ame with the corporations.</P>
<P>The laws again&s;t foreign education are clearly the very wor&s;t part of the old code. Be&s;ides your laiety, you have the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of about 4000 cler|gymen to provide for. The&s;e having no lucrative
<PB N="12" REF="11">
thing in pro&s;pect, are taken very much out of the lower orders of the people. At home, they have no means what&s;oever provided for their at|taining a clerical education, or indecd any educa|tion at all. When I was in Paris, about &s;even years ago, I looked at every thing, and lived with every kind of people, as well as my time admitted. I &s;aw there the Iri&s;h college of the Lombard, which &s;eemed to me a very good place of education, under excellent orders and regulations, and under the government of a very prudent and learned man [the late Dr. Kelly]. This college was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an annual fixed revenue of more than a thou&s;and pounds a year; the greate&s;t part of which had ari&s;en from the legacies and benefactions of per&s;ons educated in that college, and who had obtained promotions in France, from whence they made this grateful return. One in particular I remember, to the amount of ten thou&s;and livers, annually, as it is recorded on the donor's monument in their chapel.</P>
<P>It has been the cu&s;tom of poor per&s;ons in Ireland, to pick up &s;uch knowledge, of the latin tongue as, under the general di&s;couragements, and occa&s;ional pur&s;uits of magi&s;tracy, they were able to acquire; and receiving orders then at home, were &s;ent abroad to obtain a clerical education. By officiating in petty chaplain&s;hips, and performing, now and then, cer|tain offices of religion for &s;mall gratuities, they received the means of maintaining them&s;elves, un|til they were able to compleat their education.
<PB N="13" REF="12">
Through &s;uch difficulties and di&s;couragements, many of them have arrived at a very con&s;iderable proficiency, &s;o as to be marked and di&s;tingui&s;hed abroad, who afterwards, by being &s;unk in the mo&s;t abject poverty, de&s;pi&s;ed and ill-treated by the higher orders among prote&s;tants, and not much better e&s;teemed or treated, even by the few per|&s;ons of fortune of their own per&s;ua&s;ion; and con|tracting the habits and ways of thinking of the poor and uneducated, among whom they were obliged to live, in a few years retained little or no traces of the talents and acquirements, which di&s;tingui&s;h|ed them in the early period of their lives. Can we, with ju&s;tice, cut them off from the u&s;e of places of education, founded, for the greater part, from the economy of poverty and exile, without pro|viding &s;omething that is equivalent at home?</P>
<P>Whil&s;t this re&s;traint of foreign and dome&s;tic edu|cation was part of an horrible and impious &s;y&s;tem of &s;ervitude, the members were well fitted to the body. To render men patient, under a deprivation of all the rights of human nature, every thing which could give them a knowledge or feeling of tho&s;e rights was rationally forbidden. To render humanity fit to be in&s;ulted, it was fit that it &s;hould be degraded. But when we pro|fe&s;s to re&s;tore men to the capacity for pro|perty, it is equally irrational and unju&s;t to deny them the power of improving their minds as well as their fortunes. Indeed, I have ever thought the prohibition of the means of improving our rational nature, to be the wor&s;t &s;pecies of tyranny that the
<PB N="14" REF="13">
in&s;olence and perver&s;ene&s;s of mankind ever dared to exerci&s;e. This goes to all men, in all &s;ituations, to whom education can be denied.</P>
<P>Your lord&s;hip mentions a propo&s;al which came from my friend the Provo&s;t, who&s;e benevolence and enlarged &s;pirit I am perfectly convinced of; which is, the propo&s;al of erecting a few &s;izer&s;hips in the college, for the education (I &s;uppo&s;e) of roman catholic clergymen. He certainly meant it well; but, coming from &s;uch a man as he is, it is a &s;trong in&s;tance of the danger of &s;uffering any de&s;cription of men to fall into entire contempt&mdash;The charities intended for them are not perceived to be fre&s;h in&s;ults; and the true nature of their wants and nece&s;&s;ities being unknown, remedies, wholly un&s;uitable to the nature of their complaint are provided for them. It is to feed a &s;ick Gentoo with beef broth, and foment his wounds with bran|dy. If the other parts of the univer&s;ity were open to them, as well on the foundation as otherwi&s;e, the offering of &s;izer&s;hips would be a proportioned part of a <HI>general</HI> kindne&s;s. But when every thing <HI>liberal</HI> is withheld, and only that which is <HI>&s;ervile</HI> is permitted, it is ea&s;y to conceive upon what foot|ing they mu&s;t be in &s;uch a place.</P>
<P>Mr. Hutchin&s;on mu&s;t well know the regard and honour I have for him; and he cannot think my di&s;&s;enting from him in this particular, ari&s;es from a di&s;regard of his opinion: it only &s;hews that I think he has lived in Ireland: to have any re|&s;pect for the character and per&s;on of a popi&s;h prie&s;t there&mdash;oh! 'tis an uphill work indeed But until we come to re&s;pect what &s;tands in a re|&s;pectable
<PB N="15" REF="14">
light with others, we are very deficient in the temper which qualifies us to make any laws and regulations about them. It even di&s;qualifies us from being charitable to them with any effect or judgment.</P>
<P>When we are to provide for the education of any body of men, we ought &s;eriou&s;ly to con|&s;ider the particular functions they are to perform in life. A Roman catholic clergyman is the mini|&s;ter of a very ritual religion: and by his pro|fe&s;&s;ion, &s;ubject to many re&s;traints. His life is a life full of &s;trict ob&s;ervances, and his duties, of a labo|rious nature towards him&s;elf, and of the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible tru&s;t towards others. The duty of Confe&s;|&s;ion alone is &s;ufficient to &s;et in the &s;tronge&s;t light the nece&s;&s;ity of his having an appropriated mode of edu|cation. The theological opinions and peculiar Rites of one religion never can be proper lytaught in univer&s;ities, founded for the purpo&s;es and on the principles of another, which in many points is directly oppo&s;ite. If a Roman catholic clergyman, intended for celibacy, and the function of Confe&s;&s;i|on, is not &s;trictly bred in a &s;eminary where the&s;e things are re&s;pected, inculcated and enforced, as &s;acred, and not made the &s;ubject of deri&s;ion and obloquy, he will be ill fitted for the former, and the latter will be indeed in his hands a terrible in|&s;trument.</P>
<P>There is a great re&s;emblance between the whole frame and con&s;titution of the Greek and Latin churches. The &s;ecular clergy in the former, by
<PB N="16" REF="15">
being married, living under little re&s;traint, and having no particular education &s;uited to their function, are univer&s;ally fallen into &s;uch contempt, that they are never permitted to a&s;pire to the dignities of their own church. It is not held re&s;|pectful to call them papas, their true and ancient appellation but tho&s;e who wi&s;h to addre&s;s them with civility, always call them hieromonachi. In con|&s;equence of this di&s;re&s;pect, which I venture to &s;ay, in &s;uch a church mu&s;t be the con&s;equence of a &s;e|cular life, a very great degeneracy from reputable chri&s;tian manners has taken place throughout that great number of the chri&s;tian church.</P>
<P>It was &s;o with the Latin church, before the re|&s;traint on marriage. Even that re&s;traint gave ri&s;e to the greate&s;t di&s;order before the council of Trent, which together with the emulation rai&s;ed, and the good examples given by the reformed churches, wherever they were in view of each other, has brought on that happy amendment, which we &s;ee in the Latin communion, both at home and abroad.</P>
<P>The council of Trent has wi&s;ely introduced the di|&s;cipline of &s;eminaries, by which prie&s;ts are not tru&s;ted for a clerical in&s;titution, even to the &s;evere di&s;ci|pline of their colleges; but after they pa&s;s through them, are frequently, if not the greater part, ob|liged to pa&s;s through peculiar methods, having their particular ritual function in view. It is in a great mea&s;ure to this, and to &s;imilar methods u&s;ed in foreign education, that the Roman catholic clergy of Ireland, mi&s;erably provided for, living among low and ill-regulated people, without any
<PB N="17" REF="16">
di&s;cipline of &s;ufficient force to &s;ecure good manners, been hindered from becoming an intolerable nui|&s;ance to the country, in&s;tead of being, as I conceive they generally are, a very great &s;ervice to it.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ters of prote&s;tant churches require a different mode of education, more liberal and more fit for the ordinary intercour&s;e of life, and having little hold on the minds of people by external cere|monies, and extraordinary ob&s;ervances, or &s;eparate habits of living, they make up the deficiency by cultivating their minds with all kinds of ornamental learning, which the liberal provi&s;ion made in Eng|land and Ireland for the parochial clergy, and the comparative lightne&s;s of parochial duties enables the greater part of them in &s;ome con&s;iderable degree to accompli&s;h; to &s;ay nothing of the ample church preferments, with little or no duties annexed.</P>
<P>This learning, which I believe to be pretty gene|ral, together with an higher &s;ituation, and more cha&s;tened by the opinion of mankind, forms a &s;uf|ficient &s;ecurity for their morals, and their &s;u&s;taining their clerical character with dignity. It is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that all the&s;e things are, how|ever, collateral to their function, and that except in preaching, which may be and is &s;upplied, and often be&s;t &s;upplied, out of printed books, little el&s;e is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for a prote&s;tant mini&s;ter, than to be able to read the Engli&s;h language; I mean for the exerci&s;e of his function, not to the &s;ecurity of his admi&s;&s;ion. But a popi&s;h par&s;on in Ireland may do very well without any con&s;iderable cla&s;&s;ical erudition, or any
<PB N="18" REF="17">
proficiency in pure or mixed mathematics, or any knowledge of civil hi&s;tory. Even if they &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e acqui&s;itions, as at fir&s;t many of them do, they &s;oon lo&s;e them in the painful cour&s;e of pro|fe&s;&s;ional and parochial duties: but they mu&s;t have all the knowledge, and what is to them more important than the knowledge, the di&s;cipline nece&s;&s;ary to tho&s;e duties. All modes of education, conducted by tho&s;e who&s;e minds are ca&s;t in another mould, as I may &s;ay, and who&s;e original ways of thinking are formed upon the rever&s;e pattern, mu&s;t be to them not only u&s;ele&s;s, but mi&s;chievous. Ju&s;t as I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e the education in a popi&s;h eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal &s;eminary would be ill fitted for a prote&s;tant cler|gyman. Here it would be much more &s;o; as, in the ca&s;e of the fir&s;t, it only requires to reject: in the other little for his purpo&s;e is to be acquired.</P>
<P>All this, my lord, I know very well, will pa&s;s for nothing with tho&s;e who wi&s;h that the popi&s;h clergy &s;hould be illiterate, and in a &s;ituation to produce contempt and dete&s;tation. Their minds are wholly taken up with party &s;quabbles, and I have neither lei&s;ure nor inclination to apply any part of what I have to &s;ay, to tho&s;e who never think of religion, or of the commonwealth, in any other light, than as they tend to the prevalence of &s;ome faction in either. I &s;peak on a &s;uppo&s;ition, that there is a di&s;po&s;ition to take the &s;tate in the condition in which it is &s;ound, and to improve it in that &s;tate to the be&s;t advantage. Hitherto, the plan for the government
<PB N="19" REF="18">
of Ireland has been, to &s;acrifice the civil pro&s;perity of the nation to its religious improvement. But if peo|ple in power there, are at length come to entertain other ideas, they will con&s;ider the good order, deco|rum, virtue, and morality of every de&s;cription of men among them, as of infinitely greater impor|tance, than the &s;truggle (for it is nothing better) to change tho&s;e de&s;criptions by means which put to hazard, objects, which, in my poor opinion, are of more importance to religion and to the &s;tate, than all the polemical matter which has been agitated among men from the beginning of the world to this hour.</P>
<P>On this idea, an education fitted to each order and divi&s;ion of men, &s;uch as they are found, will be thought an affair rather to be encouraged than di&s;countenanced: and until in&s;titutions at home, &s;uitable to the occa&s;ions and nece&s;&s;ities of the peo|ple, and which are armed, as they are abroad, with authority to coerce the young men to be formed in them, by a &s;trict and &s;evere di&s;cipline,&mdash;the means they have, at pre&s;ent, of a cheap and effec|tual education in other countries, &s;hould not conti|nue to be prohibited by penalties and modes of in|qui&s;ition, not fit to be mentioned to ears that are or|ganized to the cha&s;te &s;ounds of equity and ju&s;tice. Be|fore I had written thus far, I heard of a &s;cheme of giving to the Ca&s;tle the patronage of the pre&s;iding members of the catholic clergy. At fir&s;t I could &s;carcely credit it: for I believe it is the fir&s;t time
<PB N="20" REF="19">
that the pre&s;entation of other people's alms has been de&s;ired in any country. If the &s;tate provides a &s;uitable maintenance and temporality for tho&s;e governing members, and clergy under them, I &s;hould think the project, however improper in other re&s;pects, to be by no means unju&s;t. But to deprive a poor people, who maintain a &s;econd &s;et of clergy, out of the mi&s;erable remains of what is left after taxing and tything&mdash;to deprive them of the di&s;po&s;ition of their own charities among their own communion, would, in my opinion, be an intolera|ble hard&s;hip. Never were the members of one re|ligious &s;ect fit to appoint the pa&s;tors to another. Tho&s;e who have no regard for their welfare, re|putation, or internal quiet, will not appoint &s;uch are as proper. The Seraglio of Con&s;tantinople is as equitable as we are, whether catholics or prote&s;|tants: and where their own &s;ect is concerned, full as religious. But the &s;port which they make of the mi&s;erable dignities of the Greek church, the little factions of the Haram, to which they make them &s;ub&s;ervient, the continual &s;ale to which they expo&s;e and re-expo&s;e the &s;ame dignity, and by which they &s;queeze all the inferior orders of the clergy, is (for I have had particular means of being acquaint|ed with it) nearly equal to all the other oppre&s;&s;i|ons together, exerci&s;ed by mu&s;&s;ulmen over the unhappy members of the Oriental church. It is a great deal to &s;uppo&s;e that even the pre&s;ent Ca&s;tle would nominate bi&s;hops for the roman church of Ire|land with a religious regard for its welfare. Perhaps they cannot, perhaps they dare not do it.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20">
But &s;uppo&s;e them as well inclined as I know that I am, to do them all kind of ju&s;tice, I declare I would not, if it were in my power, take it on my&s;elf, I know I ought not to do it. I belong to another community, and it would be intolerable u&s;urpation in me to affect &s;uch authority, where I conferred no benefit, or even if I did confer (as in &s;ome degree the Seraglio does) temporal advantages. But, allowing that the pre&s;ent Ca&s;tle finds it&s;elf fit to admini&s;ter the government of a church which they folemnly for&s;wear, and for&s;wear with very hard words and many evil epithets, and that as often as they qualify them&s;elves for the power which is to give this very patronage, or to give any thing el&s;e that they de&s;ire; yet they cannot in&s;ure them&s;elves that a man like the late lord Che&s;terfield will not &s;ucceed to them. This man, while he was duping the cre|dulity of papi&s;ts with fine words in private, and commending their good behaviour during a rebel|lion in Great Britain, (as it well de&s;erved to be commended and rewarded) was capable of urging penal laws again&s;t them in a &s;peech from the throne, and &s;timulating with provocatives the wearried and half-exhau&s;ted bigotry of the then Parliament of Ireland. They &s;et to work, but they were at a lo&s;s what to do; for they had already almo&s;t gone through every contrivance which could wa&s;te the vi|gour of their country: but, after much &s;truggle, they produced a child of their old age, the &s;hocking and
<PB N="22" REF="21">
unnatural act about marriages, which tended to fi|ni&s;h the &s;cheme for making the people not only two di&s;tinct parties for ever, but keeping them as two di&s;tinct &s;pecies in the &s;ame land. Mr. G&mdash;r's humanity was &s;hocked at it, as one of the wor&s;t parts of that truly barbarous &s;y&s;tem, if one could well &s;ettle the preference, where almo&s;t all the parts were outrages on the rights of humanity, and the law of nature.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e an athei&s;t, playing the part of a bigot, &s;hould be in power again in that country, do you believe that he would faithfully and religiou&s;ly admini&s;ter the tru&s;t of appointing pa&s;tors to a church, which, wanting every other &s;upport, &s;tands in tenfold need of mini&s;ters who will be dear to the people committed to their charge, and who will exerci&s;e a really paternal authority among&s;t them? But if the &s;uperior power was always in a di&s;po&s;ition to di&s;pen&s;e con&s;cientiou&s;ly, and like an upright tru&s;tee and guardian of the&s;e rights which he holds for tho&s;e with whom he is at variance, has he the capacity and means of doing it? How can the Lord Lieutenant form the lea&s;t judgment of their merits, &s;o as to di&s;cern which of popi&s;h prie&s;ts is fit to be made a bi&s;hop? It cannot be: the idea is ridiculous.&mdash;He will hand them over to Lords Lieu|tenant of counties, ju&s;tices of the peace, and other per&s;ons, who, for the purpo&s;e of vexing and turn|ing to deri&s;ion this mi&s;erable people, will pick out the wor&s;t and mo&s;t obnoxious they can find among&s;t
<PB N="23" REF="22">
the clergy, to &s;et over the re&s;t. Whoever is com|plainant again&s;t his brother, will be con&s;idered as per&s;ecuted: whoever is cen&s;ured by his &s;uperior, will be looked upon as oppre&s;&s;ed: whoever is care|le&s;s in his opinions, and loo&s;e in his morals, will be called a liberal man, and will be &s;uppo&s;ed to have incurred hatred, becau&s;e he was not a bigot. Informers, tale-bearers, perver&s;e and ob&s;tinate men, flatterers, who turn their back upon their flock, and court the prote&s;tant gentlemen of the country, will be the objects of preferment. And then I run no ri&s;k in foretelling, that whatever order, quiet, and morality you have in the country, will be lo&s;t. A popi&s;h clergy, who are not re&s;trained by the mo&s;t au&s;tere &s;ubordination, will become a nui&s;ance, a real public grievance of the heavie&s;t kind, in any country that entertains them: and in|&s;tead of the great benefit which Ireland does, and has long derived from them, if they are educated with|out any idea of di&s;cipline and obedience, and then put under bi&s;hops, who do not owe their &s;tation to their good opinion, and whom they cannot re&s;pect, that nation will &s;ee di&s;orders, of which, bad as things are, it has yet no idea. I do not &s;ay this as thinking the leading men in Ireland would exerci&s;e this tru&s;t wor&s;e than others. Not at all. No man, no &s;et of men living are fit to admini&s;ter the affairs or regulate the interior economy of a church to which they are enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="23">
As to Government, if I might recommend a pru|dent caution to them,&mdash;it would be, to innovate as little as po&s;&s;ible, upon &s;peculation, in e&s;tabli&s;hments, from which, as they &s;tand, they experience no ma|terial inconvenience to the repo&s;e of the country,<HI>&mdash;quieta non movere&mdash;</HI> I could &s;ay a great deal more; but I am tired: and am afraid your Lord|&s;hip is tired too. I have not &s;at to this letter a &s;in|gle quarter of an hour without interruption. It has grown long, and probably contains many repetiti|ons, from my total want of lei&s;ure to dige&s;t and con&s;olidate my thoughts: and as to my expre&s;&s;ions, I could wi&s;h to be able perhaps to mea&s;ure them more exactly. But my intentions are fair, and I certainly mean to offend nobody.</P>
<P>Thinking over this matter more maturely, I &s;ee no rea&s;on for altering my opinion in any part. The act, as far as it goes, is good undoubtedly. It a|mounts, I think, very nearly to a toleration, with re|&s;pect to religious ceremonies, but it puts a new bolt on civil rights, and rivets it, I am afraid, to the old one in &s;uch a manner, that neither, I fear, will be ea|&s;ily loo&s;ened. What I could have wi&s;hed would be, to &s;ee the civil advantages take the lead; the other, I conceive, would follow (in a manner) of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>For what I have ob&s;erved, it is pride, arrogance, and a &s;pirit of domination, and not a bigotted &s;pirit of religion, that has cau&s;ed and kept up tho&s;e oppre&s;&s;ive &s;tatutes. I am &s;ure I have known
<PB N="25" REF="24">
tho&s;e who have oppre&s;&s;ed papi&s;ts in their civil rights, exceedingly indulgent to them in their religious ceremonies, and who wi&s;hed them to con|tinue, in order to furni&s;h pretences for oppre&s;&s;ion, and who never &s;aw a man by converting e&s;cape out of their power, but with grudging and regret. I have known men, to whom I am not uncharitable in &s;aying, (though they are dead,) that they would become papi&s;ts in order to oppre&s;s prote&s;tants; if, being prote&s;tants, it was not in their power to op|pre&s;s papi&s;ts. It is inju&s;tice, and not a mi&s;taken con&s;cience, that has been the principle of per&s;ecu|tion, at lea&s;t as far as it has fallen under my ob&s;er|vation. However, as I began, &s;o I end. I do not know the map of the country. Mr. G&mdash;r, who conducts this great and difficult work, and tho&s;e who &s;upport him, are better judges of the bu&s;ine&s;s than I can pretend to be, who have not &s;et my foot in Ireland, tho&s;e &s;ixteen years. I have been given to under&s;tand, that I am not con&s;idered as a friend to that country: and I know that pains have been taken to le&s;&s;en the credit that I might have had there.</P>
<P>I am &s;o convinced of the weak|ne&s;s of interfering in any bu&s;ine&s;s without the opini|on of the people in who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s I interfere, that I do not know how to acquit my&s;elf, of what I have now done.&mdash;I have the honour to be, with high re|gard and e&s;teem,</P>
