<BIBL>MACBETH.</BIBL></Q>
<P>EMILY was &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed, on
the following day, to find that Annette
heard of Madame Montoni's confine|ment
in the chamber over the portal, as
well as of her purpo&s;ed vi&s;it there, on
the approaching night. That the cir|cum&s;tance,
which Barnardine had &s;o &s;o|lemnly
enjoined her to conceal, he had
him&s;elf told to &s;o indi&s;creet an hearer as
Annette, appeared very improbable, though
he had now charged her with a me&s;&s;age,
<PB N="2" REF="4">
concerning the intended interview. He
reque&s;ted, that Emily would meet him,
unattended, on the terrace, at a little after
midnight, when he him&s;elf would lead her
to the place he had promi&s;ed; a propo&s;al,
from which &s;he immediately &s;hrunk, for a
thou&s;and vague fears darted athwart her
mind, &s;uch as had tormented her on the
preceding night, and which &s;he neither
knew how to tru&s;t, or to di&s;mi&s;s. It fre|quently
occurred to her, that Barnardine
might have deceived her, concerning Ma|dame
Montoni, who&s;e murderer, perhaps,
he really was; and that he had deceived
her by order of Montoni, the more ea&s;ily
to draw her into &s;ome of the de&s;perate
de&s;igns of the latter. The terrible &s;u&s;|picion,
that Madame Montoni no longer
lived, thus came, accompanied by one
not le&s;s dreadful for her&s;elf. Unle&s;s the
crime, by which the aunt had &s;uffered, was
in&s;tigated merely by re&s;entment, uncon|nected
with profit, a motive, upon which
Montoni did not appear very likely to act,
<PB N="3" REF="5">
its object mu&s;t be unattained, till the niece
was al&s;o dead, to whom Montoni knew
that his wife's e&s;tates mu&s;t de&s;cend. Emily
remembered the words, which had in|formed
her, that the conte&s;ted e&s;tates in
France would devolve to her, if Madame
Montoni died, without con&s;igning them to
her hu&s;band, and the former ob&s;tinate per&s;e|verance
of her aunt made it too probable,
that &s;he had, to the la&s;t, withheld them.
At this in&s;tant, recollecting Barnardine's
manner, on the preceding night, &s;he
now believed, what &s;he had then fancied,
that it expre&s;&s;ed malignant triumph. She
&s;huddered at the recollection, which con|firmed
her fears, and determined not to
meet him on the terrace. Soon after, &s;he
was inclined to con&s;ider the&s;e &s;u&s;picions as
the extravagant exaggerations of a timid
and hara&s;&s;ed mind, and could not believe
Montoni liable to &s;uch prepo&s;terous de|pravity
as that of de&s;troying, from one
motive, his wife and her niece. She
blamed her&s;elf for &s;uffering her romantic
<PB N="4" REF="6">
imagination to carry her &s;o far beyond the
bounds of probability, and determined to
endeavour to check its rapid flights, le&s;t
they &s;hould &s;ometimes extend into mad|ne&s;s
Still, however, &s;he &s;hrunk from the
thought of meeting Barnardine, on the
terrace, at midnight; and &s;till the wi&s;h to
be relieved from this terrible &s;u&s;pen&s;e,
concerning her aunt, to &s;ee her, and to
&s;ooth her &s;ufferings, made her he&s;itate
what to do,</P>
<P>&startq;Yet how is it po&s;&s;ible, Annette, I
can pa&s;s to the terrace at that hour?&endq; &s;aid
&s;he, recollecting her&s;elf, &startq;the &s;entinels
will &s;top me, and Signor Montoni will
hear of the affair.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O ma'm&s;elle! that is well thought of,&endq;
replied Annette. &startq;That is what Barnar|dine
told me about. He gave me this
key, and bade me &s;ay it unlocks the door
at the end of the vaulted gallery, that
opens near the end of the ea&s;t rampart, &s;o
that you need not pa&s;s any of the men
in watch. He bade me &s;ay, too, that his
<PB N="5" REF="7">
rea&s;on for reque&s;ting you to come to the
terrace was, becau&s;e he could take you to
the place you wane to go to, without
opening the great doors of the hall, which
grate &s;o heavily.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily's &s;pirits were &s;omewhat calmed
by this explanation, which &s;eemed to be
hone&s;tly given to Annette. &startq;But why
did he de&s;ire I would come alone, An|nette?&endq;
&s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>&startq;Why that was what I a&s;ked him my|&s;elf,
ma'am&s;elle. Says I, Why is my young
lady to come alone?&mdash;Surely I may come
with her!&mdash;What harm can Ido? But he
&s;aid &startq;No&mdash;no&mdash;I tell you not,&endq; in his gruff
way. Nay, &s;ays I, I have been tru&s;ted in
as great affairs as this,. I warrant, and it's
a hard matter if I can't keep a &s;ecret now.
Still he would &s;ay nothing but&mdash;&startq;No&mdash;no&mdash;no.&endq;
Well, &s;ays I, if you will only tru&s;t
me, I will tell you a great &s;ecret, that was
told me a month ago, and I have never
opened my lips about it yet&mdash;&s;o you need,
not be afraid of telling me. But all would
<PB N="6" REF="8">
not do. Then, ma'am&s;elle, I went &s;o far
as to offer him a beautiful new &s;equin,
that Ludovico gave me for a keep-&s;ake,
and I would not have parted with it for
all St. Marco's Place; but even that would
not do! Now what can be the rea&s;on of
this? But I know, you know, ma'am, who
you are going to &s;ee.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Pray did Barnardine tell you this?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He! No, ma'am&s;elle, that he did not.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily enquired who did, but Annette
&s;hewed, that &s;he <HI>could</HI> keep a &s;ecret.</P>
<P>During the remainder of the day, Emily's
mind was agitated with doubts and fears
and contrary determinations, on the &s;ub|ject
of meeting this Barnardine on the
rampart, and &s;ubmitting her&s;elf to his gui|dance,
&s;he &s;carcely knew whither. Pity
for her aunt and anxiety for her&s;elf alter|nately
&s;wayed her determination, and night
came, before &s;he had decided upon her
conduct. She heard the ca&s;tle clock &s;trike
eleven&mdash;twelve&mdash;and yet her mind wavered.
The time, however, was now come, when
<PB N="7" REF="9">
&s;he could he&s;itate no longer: and then the
intere&s;t &s;he felt for her aunt overcame
other con&s;iderations, and, bidding Annette
follow her to the outer door of the vaulted
gallery, and there a wait her return, &s;he
de&s;cended from her chamber. The ca&s;tle
was perfectly &s;till, and the great hall, where
&s;o lately &s;he had witne&s;&s;ed a &s;cene of
dreadful. contention, now returned only
the whi&s;pering foot&s;teps of the two &s;olitary
figures gliding fearfully between the pillars,
and gleamed only to the feeble lamp they
carried. Emily, deceived by the long &s;ha|dows
of the pillars and by the catching
lights between, often &s;topped, imagining
&s;he &s;aw &s;ome per&s;on, moving in the di&s;tant
ob&s;curity of the per&s;pective; and, as &s;he
pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e pillars, &s;he feared to turn her
eyes toward them, almo&s;t expecting to &s;ee a
figure &s;tart out from behind their broad
&s;haft. She reached, however, the vaulted
gallery, without interruption, but unclo&s;ed
its outer door with a trembling hand, and,
charging Annette not to quit it and to
keep it a little open, that &s;he might be
<PB N="8" REF="10">
heard if &s;he called, &s;he delivered to her
the lamp, which &s;he did not dare to take
her&s;elf because&s;e of the men on watch, and,
alone, &s;tepped out upon the dark terrace.
Every thing was &s;o &s;till, that &s;he feared,
le&s;t her own light &s;teps &s;hould be heard
by the di&s;tant &s;entinels, and &s;he walked
cautiou&s;ly towards the &s;pot, where &s;he had
before met Barnardine, li&s;tening for a
&s;ound, and looking onward through the
gloom in &s;earch of him. At length, &s;he
was &s;tartled by a deep voice, that &s;poke
near her, and &s;he pau&s;ed, uncertain whether
it was his, till it &s;poke again, and &s;he then
recognized the hollow tones of Barnardine,
who had been punctual to the moment,
and was at the appointed place, re&s;ting on
the rampart wall. After chiding her for
not coming &s;ooner, and &s;aying, that he
had been waiting nearly half an hour, he
de&s;ired Emily, who made no reply, to
follow him to the door, through which he
had entered the terrace.</P>
<P>While he unlocked it, &s;he looked back
to that &s;he had left, and, ob&s;erving the
<PB N="9" REF="11">
rays of the lamp &s;tream through a &s;mall
opening, was certain, that Annette was
&s;lill there. But her remote &s;ituation could
little befriend Emily, after &s;he had quitted
the terrace; and, when Barnardine un|clo&s;ed
the gate, the di&s;mal a&s;pect of the
pa&s;&s;age beyond, &s;hewn by a torch burning
on the pavement, made her &s;hrink from
following him alone, and &s;he refu&s;ed to go,
unle&s;s Annette might accompany her.
This, However, Barnardine ab&s;olutely re|fu&s;ed
to permit, mingling at the &s;ame
time with his refu&s;al &s;uch artful circum|&s;tances
to heighten the pity and curio&s;ity
of Emily towards her aunt; that, &s;he, at
length, con&s;ented to follow him alone to
the portal.</P>
<P>He then took up the torch, and led her
along the pa&s;&s;age, at the extremity of
which he unlocked another door, whence
they de&s;cended, a few &s;teps, into a chapel,
which, as Barnardine held up the torch to
light her, Ernily ob&s;erved to be in ruins,
and &s;he immediately rccolledled a former
<PB N="10" REF="12">
conver&s;ation of Annette, concerning it,
with very unplea&s;ant emotions. She
looked fearfully on the almo&s;t roofle&s;s walls,
green with damps, and on the gothic
points of the windows, where the ivy and
the briony had long &s;upplied the place of
gla&s;s, and ran mantling among the broken
capitals of &s;ome columns, that had once
&s;upported the roof. Barnardine &s;tumbled
over the broken pavement, and his voice,
as he uttered a &s;udden oath, was returned
in hollow echoes, that made it more ter|rific.
Emily's heart &s;unk; but &s;he &s;till
followed him, and he turned out of what
had been the principal ai&s;le of the chapel.
&startq;Down the&s;e &s;teps, lady,&endq; &s;aid Barnardine,
as he de&s;cended a flight, which appeared
to lead into the vaults; but Emily pau&s;ed
on the top, and demanded, in a tremulous
tone, whither he was conducting her,</P>
<P>&startq;To the portal,&endq; &s;aid Barnardine.</P>
<P>&startq;Cannot we go through the chapel to
the portal?&endq; &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>&startq;No, Signora, that leads to the inner
<PB N="11" REF="13">
court, which I don't choo&s;e to unlock.
This way, and we &s;hall reach the outer
court pre&s;ently,&endq;</P>
<P>Emily &s;till he&s;itated; fearing not only
to go on, but, &s;ince &s;he had gone thus far,
to irritate Bamardine by refu&s;ing to. go
further.</P>
<P>&startq;Come, lady,&endq; &s;aid the man, who had
nearly reached the bottom of the flight,
&startq;make a little ha&s;te; I cannot wait here all night.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Whither do the&s;e &s;teps lead?&endq; &s;aid
Emily, yet, pau&s;ing.</P>
<P>&startq;To the portal,&endq; repeated Barnardine,
in an angry tone, &startq;I will wait no longer.&endq;
As he &s;aid this, he moved on with the
light, and Emily, fearing to provoke him
by further delay, reluctantly followed.
From the &s;teps, they proceeded through
a pa&s;&s;age, adjoining the vaults, the walls
of which were dropping with unwhole&s;ome
dews, and the vapours, that crept along
the ground, made the torch burn &s;o dimly,
that Emily expected every moment to &s;ee
<PB N="12" REF="14">
it extingui&s;hed, and Barnardine could
&s;carcely find his way. As they advanced,
the&s;e vapours thickened, and Barnardine,
believing the torch was expiring, &s;lopped
for a moment to trim it. As he then re&s;ted
again&s;t a pair of iron gates, that opened
from the pa&s;&s;age, Emily &s;aw, by uncertain
fla&s;hes of light, the vaults beyond, and,
near her, heaps of earth, that &s;eemed to
&s;urround an open grave. Such an object,
in &s;uch a &s;cene, would, at any time, have
di&s;turbed her; but now &s;he was &s;hocked
by an in&s;tantaneous pre&s;entiment, that
this was the grave of her unfortunate aunt,
and that the treacherous Barnardine was
leading her&s;elf to de&s;truction. The ob|&s;cure
and terrible place, to which he had
conducted her, &s;eemed to ju&s;lify the
thought; it was a place &s;uited for murder,
a receptacle for the dead, where a deed of
horror might be committed, and no ve&s;tige
appear to proclaim it. Emily was &s;o
overwhelmed with terror, that for a mo|ment,
&s;he was unable to determine what
<PB N="13" REF="15">
conduct to pur&s;ue. She then con&s;idered,
that it would be vain to attempt an e&s;cape
from Barnardine, by flight, &s;ince the
length and the intricacy of the way &s;he
had pa&s;&s;ed, would &s;oon enable him to over|take
her, who was unacquainted with the
turnings, and who&s;e feeblene&s;s would not
&s;uffer her to run long with &s;wiftne&s;s. She
feared equally to irritate him by a di&s;clo|&s;ure
of her &s;u&s;picions, which a refu&s;al to
accompany him further certainly would
do; and, &s;ince &s;he was already as much
in his power as it was po&s;&s;ible &s;he could
be, if &s;he proceeded, &s;he at length, deter|mined
to &s;uppre&s;s, as far as &s;he could, the
appearance of apprehen&s;ion, and to follow
&s;ilently whither he de&s;igned to lead her.
Pale with horror and anxiety, &s;he now
waited till Barnardine had trimmed the
torch, and, as her &s;ight glanced again
upon the grave, &s;he could not forbear en|quiring,
for whom it was prepared. He
took his eyes from the torch, and fixed
them upon her face without &s;peaking. She
<PB N="14" REF="16">
faintly repeated the que&s;tion, but the
man, &s;haking the torch, pa&s;&s;ed on; and
&s;he followed, trembling, to a &s;econd flight
of &s;teps, having a&s;cended Which, a door
delivered them into the fir&s;t court of the
ca&s;tle. As they cro&s;&s;ed it, the light &s;hew|ed
the high black walls around them,
fringed with long gra&s;s and dank weeds,
that found a &s;canty &s;oil among the
mouldering &s;tones; the heavy buttre&s;&s;es,
with, here and there between them, a
narrow grate, that admitted a freer circu|lation
of air to the court, the ma&s;&s;y iron
gates, that led to the ca&s;tle, who&s;e clu&s;|tering
turrets appeared above, and, oppo|&s;ite
the huge towers and arch of the portal
it&s;elf. In this &s;cene the large, uncouth
per&s;on of Barnardine, bearing the torch,
formed a characteri&s;tic figure. This Bar|nardine
was wrapt in a long dark cloak,
which &s;carcely allowed the kind; of half|boots,
or &s;andals, that were laced upon his
legs, to appear, and &s;hewed only the point
of a broad-&s;word, which he u&s;ually wore,
<PB N="15" REF="17">
&s;lung in a belt acro&s;s his &s;houlders. On
his head was a heavy flat velvet cap, &s;ome|what
re&s;embling a turban, in which was a
&s;hort feather; the vi&s;age beneath it &s;hewed
&s;trong features, and a countenance fur|rowed
with the lines of cunning and dark|ened
by habitual di&s;content.</P>
<P>The view of the court, however, reani|mated
Emily, who, as &s;he cro&s;&s;ed &s;ilently
towards the portal, began to hope, that
her own fears, and not the treachery of
Barnardine, had deceived her. She look|ed
ainxiou&s;ly up at the fir&s;t ca&s;ement, that
appeared above the lo&s;ty arch of the port|cullis;
but it was dark, and &s;he enquired,
whether it belonged to the chamber, where
Madame Montoni was confined. Emily
&s;poke low, and Barnardine, perhaps, did
not hear her que&s;tion, for he returned no
an&s;wer; and they, &s;oon after, entered the
po&s;tern door of the gate-way, which
brought them to the foot of a narrow
&s;tairca&s;e, that wound up one of the towers.</P>
<P>&startq;Up this &s;tair-ca&s;e the Signora lies,&endq;
&s;aid Barnardine.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="18">
&startq;Lies!&endq; repeated Emily faintly, as
&s;he began to a&s;cend.</P>
<P>&startq; She lies in, the upper chamber,&endq; &s;aid
Barnardine.</P>
<P>As they pa&s;&s;ed up, the wind, which
poured, through the narrow cavities in the
wall, made the torch flare, and it threw
a &s;tronger gleam upon the grim and &s;allow
countenance of Barnardine, and di&s;covered
more fully the de&s;olation of the place&mdash;the
rough &s;tone walls, the &s;piral &s;tairs,
black with age, and a &s;uit of antient ar|mour,
with an iron vi&s;or, that, hung upon
the walls, and, appeared a trophy of &s;ome former victory.</P>
<P>Having reached a landing-place, &startq;You
may wait here, lady,&endq; &s;aid he, applying a
key to the door of a chamber, &startq;while I
go up, and tell the Signora you are
coming.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That ceremony is unnece&s;&s;ary,&endq; re|plied
Emily, &startq;my aunt will rejoice to
&s;ee me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am not &s;o &s;ure of that&endq; &s;aid Barn|ardine,
<PB N="17" REF="19">
pointing to the room he had opened:
&startq;Come in here, lady, while I &s;tep up.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily, &s;urpri&s;ed and &s;omewhat &s;hocked,
did not dare to oppo&s;e him further, but,
as he was turning away with the torch,
de&s;ired he would not leave her in dark|ne&s;s.
He looked around, and, ob&s;erving
a tripod lamp, that &s;tood on the &s;tairs,
lighted and gave it to Emily, who &s;tepped
forward into a large old chamber, and he
clo&s;ed the door. As &s;he li&s;tened anxiou&s;ly
to his departing &s;teps, &s;he thought he de|&s;cended,
in&s;tead of a&s;cending, the &s;tairs; but
the gu&s;ts of wind, that whi&s;tled round the
portal, would not allow her to hear di&s;|tinctly
any other &s;ound. Still, however,
&s;he li&s;tened,' and, perceiving no &s;tep in
the room above, where he had affirmed
Madame Montoni to be, her anxiety in|crea&s;ed
though &s;he con&s;idered, that the
thickne&s;s of the floor in this &s;trong build|ing
might prevent any &s;ound reaching her
from the upper chamber. The next mo|ment,
in a pau&s;e of the wind, &s;he di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
<PB N="18" REF="20">
Barnardine's &s;tep descending to
the court, and then thought &s;he heard his
voice, but, the ri&s;ing gu&s;t again over|coming
other &s;ounds, Emily, to be certain
on this point, moved &s;oftly to the door,
which, on attempting to open it, &s;he di&s;|covered
was fa&s;tened. All the horrid ap|prehen&s;ions,
that had lately a&s;&s;ailed her,
returned at this in&s;tant with redoubled
force, and no longer appeared like the ex|aggerations
of a timid &s;pirit, but &s;eemed.
to have been &s;ent to warn her of her fate.
She now did not doubt, that Madame
Montoni had been murdered, perhaps in
this very chamber; or that &s;he her&s;elf was
brought hither for the &s;ame purpo&s;e The
countenance, the manners and the recol|lected
words of Barnardine, when he had
&s;poken of her aunt, confirmed her wor&s;t
fears. For &s;ome moments, &s;he was inca|pable
of con&s;idering of any means, by
which &s;he might attempt an e&s;cape. Still
&s;he li&s;tened, but heard foot&s;teps neither on
the &s;tairs, or in the room above; &s;he
<PB N="19" REF="21">
thought, however, that &s;he again dl&s;tin|gui&s;hed
Barnardine's voice below, and
went to a grated window, that opened
upon the court, to enquire further. Here,
&s;he plainly heard his hoar&s;e accents, min|gling
with the bla&s;t, that &s;wept by, but
they were lo&s;t again &s;o quickly, that their
meaning could not be interpreted; and
then the light of a torch, which &s;eemed to
i&s;&s;ue from the portal below, fla&s;hed acro&s;s
the court, and the long &s;hadow of a man,
who was under the arch-way, appeared
upon the pavement. Emily, from the huge|ne&s;s
of this &s;udden portrait, concluded it
to be that of Barnardine; but other deep
tones, which pa&s;&s;ed in the wind, &s;oon con|vinced
her he was not alone, and that his
companion was not a per&s;on very liable to
pity.</P>
<P>When her &s;pirits had overcome the fir&s;t
&s;hock of her &s;ituation, &s;he held up the
lamp to examine, if the chamber afforded
a po&s;&s;ibility of an e&s;cape. It was a &s;pa|cious
room, who&s;e walls, wain&s;coted with
<PB N="20" REF="22">
rough oak, &s;hewed no ca&s;ement but the
grated one, which Emily had left, and no
other door than that, by which &s;he had
entered. The feeble rays of the lamp,
however, did not allow her to &s;ee at once
its full extent; &s;he perceived no furniture,
except, indeed, an iron chair, fa&s;tened in
the centre of the chamber, immediately
over which depending on a chain from
the cieling, hung an iron ring. Having
gazed upon, the&s;e, for &s;ome time, with
wonder and horror, &s;he next ob&s;erved
iron bars below, made for the purpo&s;e of
confining the feet, and on the arms of the
chair were rings of the &s;ame metal. As
&s;he continued to. &s;urvey them, me con|cluded,
that they were in&s;truments of tor|ture,
and. it &s;truck her, that &s;ome poor
wretch had once been fa&s;tened in this chair,
and had there been &s;tarved to death. She
was chilled by the thought; but, what was
her agony, when, in the next moment, it
occurred to her, that her aunt might have
been one of the&s;e victims, and that &s;he
<PB N="21" REF="23">
her&s;elf might be the next! An acute
pain &s;eized her head, &s;he was &s;carcely able
to hold the lamp, and, looking round for
&s;upport, was &s;eating her&s;elf, uncon&s;ciou&s;ly,
in the iron chair it&s;elf; but &s;uddenly per|ceiving
where &s;he was, &s;he &s;tarted from it
in horror, and &s;prung towards a remote
end of the room. Here again &s;he looked
round for a &s;eat to &s;u&s;tain her, and per|ceived
only a dark curtain, which, de|&s;cending
from the cieling to the floor, was
drawn along the whole &s;ide of the chamber.
Ill as &s;he was, the appearance of this cur|tain
&s;truck her, and &s;he pau&s;ed to gaze
upon it, in wonder and apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>It &s;eemed to conceal a rece&s;s of the
chamber; &s;he wi&s;hed, yet dreaded, to
lift it, and to di&s;cover what it veiled:
twice &s;he was withheld by a recollection
of the terrible &s;pectacle her daring hand
had formerly unveiled in an apartment of
the ca&s;tle, till, &s;uddenly conjecturing,
that it concealed the body of her murdered
aunt, &s;he &s;eized it, in a fit of de&s;peration,
<PB N="22" REF="24">
and drew it a&s;ide. Beyond, appeared a
corp&s;e, &s;tretched on a kind of low couch,
which was crim&s;oned with human blood,
as was the floor beneath. The features,
deformed by death, were gha&s;tly and hor|rible,
and more than one livid wound ap|peared
in the face. Emily, bending over
the body, gazed, for a moment, with an
eager, frenzied eye; but, in the next, the
lamp dropped from her hand, and &s;he
fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s at the foot of the couch.</P>
<P>When her &s;en&s;es returned, &s;he found
her&s;elf &s;urrounded by men, among whom
was Barnardine, who were lifting her from
the floor, and then bore her along the
chamber. She was &s;en&s;ible of what pa&s;&s;ed,
but the extreme languor of her &s;pirits did
not permit her to &s;peak, or move, or
even to feel any di&s;tinct fear. They car|ried
her down the &s;tair-ca&s;e, by which &s;he
had a&s;cended; when, having reached the
arch-way, they &s;topped, and one of the
men, taking the torch from Barnardine,
opened a &s;mall door, that was cut in the
<PB N="23" REF="25">
great gate, and, as he &s;tepped out upon
the road, the light he bore &s;hewed &s;everal
men on hor&s;eback, in waiting. Whether
it was the fre&s;hne&s;s of the air, that revived
Emily, or that the objects &s;he now &s;aw
rou&s;ed the &s;pirit of alarm, &s;he &s;uddenly
&s;poke, and made an ineffectual effort to
di&s;engage her&s;elf from the gra&s;p of the
ruffians, who held her.</P>
<P>Barnardine, meanwhile, called loudly
for the torch, while di&s;tant voices an&s;wered,
and &s;everal per&s;ons approached, and, in the
&s;ame in&s;tant, a light &s;la&s;hed upon the
court of the ca&s;tle. Again he vociferated
for the torch and the men hurried Emily
through the gate. At a &s;hort di&s;tance,
under the &s;helter of the ca&s;tle walls, &s;he
perceived the fellow, who had taken the
light from, the porter, holding it to a man,
bu&s;ily employed in altering the &s;addle of
a hor&s;e, round which were &s;everal hor&s;e|men,
looking on, who&s;e har&s;h features re|ceived
the full glare of the torch; while the
broken ground beneath them, the oppo|&s;ite
<PB N="24" REF="26">
walls, with the tufted &s;hrubs, that
overhung their &s;ummits, and an embattled
watch-tower above, were reddened with
the gleam, which, fading gradually away,
left the remoter ramparts and the woods
below to the ob&s;curity of night.</P>
<P>&startq;What do you wa&s;te time for, there?&endq;
&s;aid Barnardine with an oath, as he ap|proached
the hor&s;emen. &startq;Di&s;patch&mdash;di&s;patch.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The &s;addle will be ready in a mi|nute,&endq;
replied the man who was buckling
it, at whom Barnardine now &s;wore again,
for his negligence, and Emily, calling
feebly for help, was hurried towards the
hor&s;es, while the ruffians di&s;puted on
which to place her, the one de&s;igned for
her not being ready. At this moment
a clu&s;ter of lights i&s;&s;ued from the great
gates, and &s;he immediately heard the &s;hrill
voice of Annette above tho&s;e of &s;everal
other per&s;ons, who advanced. In the
&s;ame moment, &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed Montoni
and Cavigni, followed by a number of
<PB N="25" REF="27">
ruffian-faced fellows, to whom &s;he no
longer looked with terror, but with hope,
for, at this in&s;tant, &s;he did not tremble at the
thought of any dangers, that might await
her within the ca&s;tle, whence &s;o lately,
and &s;o anxious&s;ly &s;he had wi&s;hed to e&s;cape.
Tho&s;e, which threatened her: from without,
had engro&s;&s;ed all her apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>A &s;hort conte&s;t en&s;ued between the
parties, in which that of Montoni, how|ever,
were pre&s;ently victors, and the
hor&s;emen, perceiving that numbers were
again&s;t them, and being, perhaps, not
very warmly intere&s;ted in the affair
they had undertaken, galloped off, while
Barnardine had run far enough to be lo&s;t
in the darken&s;s, and Emily was led back
into the ca&s;tle. As &s;he re- pa&s;&s;ed the
courts, the remembrance of what &s;he had
&s;een in the portal-chamber came, with all
its horror, to her mind; and when, &s;oon
after, &s;he heard the gate clo&s;e, that &s;hut
her once more within the ca&s;tle walls, &s;he
&s;huddered for her&s;elf, and, almo&s;t forgetting
<PB N="26" REF="28">
the danger &s;he had e&s;caped, could
&s;carcely think, that any thing le&s;s precious
than liberty and peace was to be found
beyond them.</P>
<P>Montoni ordered Emily to await him in
the cedar parlour, whither he &s;oon follow|ed,
and then &s;ternly que&s;tioned her on
this my&s;terious affair. Though &s;he now
viewed him with horror, as the murderer
of her aunt, and &s;carcely knew what &s;he
&s;aid in reply to his impatient enquiries,
her an&s;wers and her manner convinced
him, that &s;he had not taken a voluntary
part in the late &s;cheme, and he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
her upon the appearance of his &s;ervants,
whom he had ordered to attend, that he
might enquire further into the affair, and
di&s;cover tho&s;e, who bad been accomplices
in it.</P>
<P>Emily had been &s;ome time in her apart|ment,
before the tumult of her mind al|lowed
her to remember &s;everal of the
pa&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances. Then, again, the
dead form, which the curtain in the por|tal-chamber
<PB N="27" REF="29">
had di&s;clo&s;ed, came to her
fancy, and &s;he uttered a groan, which
terrified Annette the more, as Emily for|bore
to &s;atisfy her curio&s;ity, on the &s;ub|ject
of it, for &s;he feared to tru&s;t her with
&s;o fatal a &s;ecret, le&s;t her indi&s;cretion
&s;hould call down the immediate vengeance
of Montoni on her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Thus compelled to bear within her own.
mind the whole horror of the &s;ecret, that
oppre&s;&s;ed it, her reason &s;eemed to totter
under the intolerable weight. She often
fixed a wild and vacant look on Annette,
and, when &s;he &s;poke, either did not hear
her, or an&s;wered from the purpo&s;e. Long
fits of ab&s;traction &s;ucceeded; Annette
&s;poke repeatedly, but her voice &s;eemed
not to make any impre&s;&s;ion on the &s;en&s;e
of the long agitated Emily, who &s;at fixed
and &s;ilent, except that, now and then, &s;he
heaved a heavy &s;igh, but without tears.</P>
<P>Terrified at her condition, Annette, at
length, left the room, to inform Montoni
of it, who had ju&s;t di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his &s;ervants,
<PB N="28" REF="30">
without having made any di&s;coveries on
the &s;ubject of his enquiry. The wild de|&s;cription,
which this girl now gave of
Emily, induced him to follow her imme|diately
to the chamber.</P>
<P>At the &s;ound of his voice, Emily
turned her eyes, and a gleam of recol|lection
&s;eemed to &s;hoot athwart her mind,
for &s;he immediately ro&s;e from her &s;eat, and
moved &s;lowly to a remote part of the
room. He &s;poke to her in accents &s;ome|what
&s;oftened from their u&s;ual har&s;hne&s;s,
but &s;he regarded him with a kind of half
curious., half terrified look, and an&s;wered
only &startq;yes,&endq; to whatever he &s;aid. Her
mind &s;till &s;eemed to retain no other im|pre&s;&s;ion,
than that of fear.</P>
<P>Of this di&s;order Annette could give no
explanation, and Montoni, having at|tempted,
for &s;ome time, to per&s;uade
Emily to talk, retired, after ordering An|nette
to remain with her, during the
night, and to inform him, in the morning,
of her condition.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="31">
When he was gone, Emily again came
forward, and a&s;ked who it was, that had
been there to di&s;turb her. Annette &s;aid it
was the Signor&mdash;Signor Montoni. Emily
repeated the name after her, &s;everal times
as if &s;he did not recollect it, and then &s;ud|denly
groaned, and relap&s;ed into ab&s;trac|tion.</P>
<P>With &s;ome difficulty, Annette led her
to the bed, which Emily examined with
an eager, frenzied eye, before &s;he lay
down, and then, pointing, turned with
&s;huddering emotion, to Annette, who, now
more terrified, went towards the door,
that &s;he might bring one of the female
&s;ervants to pa&s;s the night with them; but
Emily, ob&s;erving her going, called her by
name, and then in the naturally &s;oft and
plaintive tone of her voice, begged, that
&s;he, too, would not for&s;ake her.&mdash;&startq;For
&s;ince my father died,&endq; added &s;he, &s;ighing,
&startq;every body for&s;akes me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Your father, ma'am&s;elle!&endq; &s;aid An|nette,
&startq;he was dead before you knew me.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="32">
&startq;He was, indeed!&endq; rejoined Emily,
and her tears began to flow. She now wept
&s;ilently and $ong, after which, becoming
quite calm, &s;he at length &s;unk to &s;leep, An|nette
having had di&s;cretion enough not to
interrupt her tears. This girl, as affection|ate
as &s;he was &s;imple, lo&s;t in the&s;e moments
all her former fears of remaining in the
chamber, and watched alone by Emily,
during the whole night.</P>

<P>EMILY's mind was refre&s;hed by &s;leep.
On waking in the morning, &s;he looked
with &s;urpri&s;e on Annette, who fat &s;leeping
in a chair be&s;ide the bed, and then en|deavoured
to recollect her&s;elf; but the
circum&s;tances of the preceding night were
&s;wept from her memory, which &s;eemed to
retain no trace of what had pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;he
was &s;till gazing with &s;urpri&s;e on Annette,
when the latter awoke.</P>
<P>&startq;O dear ma'am&s;elle! do you know
me?&endq; cried &s;he</P>
<P>&startq;Know you! Certainly,&endq; replied Emi|ly,
<PB N="32" REF="34">
&startq;you are Annette; but why are you
&s;itting by me thus?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O you have been very ill, ma'am&s;elle,
&mdash;very ill indeed! and I am fure I
thought&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This is very &s;trange!&endq; &s;aid Emily, &s;till
trying to recollect the pa&s;t.&mdash;&startq;But I think
I do remember, that my fancy has been
haunted by frightful dreams. Good God!
&s;he added, &s;uddenly &s;tarting&mdash;&startq;&s;urely it
was nothing more than a dream!&endq;</P>
<P>She fixed a terrified look upon Annertte,
who, intending to quiet her, &s;aid &startq;Yes,

but it is all over now.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;She <HI>is</HI> murdered, then!&endq; &s;aid Emily
in an inward voice, and &s;huddering in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly.
Annette &s;creamed; for,
being ignorant of the circum&s;tance to
which Emily referred, &s;he attributed her
manner to a di&s;ordered fancy; but, when
&s;he had explained to what her own &s;peech
alluded, Emily, recollecting the attempt
that had been made to carry her off, a&s;ked
<PB N="33" REF="35">
if the contriver of it had been di&s;cover|ed
Annette replied, that he had not,
though he might ea&s;ily be gue&s;&s;ed at; and
then told Emily &s;he might thank her for
her deliverance, who, endeavouring to
command the emotion, which the remem|brance
of her aunt had occa&s;ioned, appeared
calmly to li&s;ten to Annette, though, in
truth, &s;he heard &s;carcely a word that was
&s;aid.</P>
<P>&startq;And &s;o, ma'am&s;elle,&endq; continued the
latter, &startq;I was determined to be even with
Barnardine for refu&s;ing to tell me the &s;e|cret,
by finding it out my&s;elf; &s;o I watch|ed
you, on the terrace, and, as &s;oon as
he had opened the door at the end, I &s;tole
out from the ca&s;tle, to try to follow you;
for, &s;ays I, I am &s;ure no good can be plan|ned,
or why all this &s;ecrecy? So, &s;ure
enough, he had not bolted the door after
him, and, when I opened it, I &s;aw, by the
glimmer of the torch, at the other end of
the pa&s;&s;&s;age, which way you were go|ing.
I followed the light, at a di&s;tance,
<PB N="34" REF="36">
till you came to the vaults of the chapel,
and there I was afraid to go further, for
I had heard &s;trange things about the&s;e
vaults. But then, again, I was afraid to go
back, all in darken&s;s, by my&s;elf; &s;o by the
time Barnardine had trimmed the light, I
had re&s;olved to follow you, and I did &s;o,
till you came to the great court, and there
I was afraid he would &s;ee me; &s;o I &s;topped
at the door again, and watched you acro&s;s
to the gates, and, when you was gone up
the &s;tairs, I whipt after. There, as I &s;tood
under the gate-way, I heard hor&s;es' feet
without, and &s;everal men talking; and I
heard them &s;wearing at Barnardine for not
bringing you out, and ju&s;t then he had
like to have caught me, for he came down
the &s;tairs again, and I had hardly time to
get out of his way. But I had heard enough
of his &s;ecret now, and I determined to be
even with him, and to &s;ave you, too,
ma'am&s;elle, for I gue&s;&s;ed it to be &s;ome new
&s;cheme of Count Morano, though he was
gone away. I ran into the ca&s;tle, but I
<PB N="35" REF="37">
had hard work to find my way through
the pa&s;&s;age under the chapel, and what is
very &s;trange, I quite forgot to look for
the gho&s;ts they had told me about, though
I would not go into that place again by
my&s;elf for all the world! Luckily the Sig|nor
and Signor Cavigni were up, &s;o we
had &s;oon a train at our heels, &s;ufficient to
frighten that Barnardine and his rogues,
all together.</P>
<P>Annette cea&s;ed to &s;peak, but, Enriily &s;till
appeared to li&s;ten. At length &s;he &s;aid,
&s;uddenly, &startq;I think 1 will go to him my|&s;elf;
&mdash;where is he?&endq;</P>
<P>Annette a&s;ked who was meant.</P>
<P>&startq;Signor Montoni,&endq; replied Emily,
&startq;I would &s;peak with him;&endq; and Annette,
now remembering the order he had given,
on the preceding night, re&s;pecting her
young lady, ro&s;e, and &s;aid &s;he would &s;eek
him her&s;elf.</P>
<P>This hone&s;t girl's &s;u&s;picions of Count
Morano were perfectly ju&s;t; Emily, too,
when &s;he thought on the &s;cheme, had at|tributed
<PB N="36" REF="38">
it to him; and Montoni, who had
not a doubt on this &s;ubject, al&s;o, began
to believe, that it was by the direction of
Morano, that poi&s;on had formerly been
mingled with his wine.</P>
<P>The profe&s;&s;ions of repentance, which
Morano had made to Emily, under the
angui&s;h of his wound, were &s;incere at the
moment lie offered them; but he had
mi&s;taken the &s;ubject of his &s;orrow, for,
while he thought he was condemning the
cruelty of his late de&s;ign, he was lament|ing
only the &s;tate of &s;uffering, to which
it had reduced him. As the&s;e &s;uffer|ings
abated, his former views revived,
till, his health being re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, he
again found him&s;elf ready for enterpri&s;e
and difficulty. The porter of the ca&s;tle,
who had &s;erved him, on a former occa&s;ion,
willingly accepted a &s;econd bribe; and,
having concerted the means of drawing
Emily to the gates, Morano publicly left
the hamlet, whither he had been carried
after the affray, and withdrew with his
<PB N="37" REF="39">
people to another at &s;everal miles di&s;tance.
From thence, on a night agreed upon by
Barnardine, who had di&s;covered from
the thoughtle&s;s prattle of Annette, the
mo&s;t probabe means of decoying Emily,
the Count &s;ent back his &s;ervants to the
ca&s;tle, while he awaited her arrival at
the hamlet, with an intention of carrying
her immediately to Venice. How this,
his &s;econd &s;cheme, was fru&s;trated, has
already appeared; but the violent, and
various pa&s;&s;ions with which this Italian
lover was now agitated, on his return to
that city, can only be imagined.</P>
<P>Annette having made her report to
Mantoni of Emily's health and of her
reque&s;t to &s;ee him, he replied, that &s;he
might attend him in the cedar room, in
about an hour. It was on the &s;ubject, that
pre&s;&s;ed &s;o heavily on her mind, that Emily
wi&s;hed to &s;peak to him, yet &s;he did not
di&s;tinctly know what good purpo&s;e this
could an&s;wer, and &s;ometimes &s;he even re|coiled
in horror from the expectation of
<PB N="38" REF="40">
his pre&s;ence. She wi&s;hed, al&s;o, to peti|tion,
though &s;he &s;carcely dared to believe
the reque&s;t would be granted, that he
would permit her, &s;ince her aunt was no
more, to return to her native country.</P>
<P>As the moment of interview approached,
her agitation increa&s;ed &s;o much, that &s;he
almo&s;t re&s;olved to excu&s;e her&s;elf under
what could &s;carcely be called a pretence
of illne&s;s; and, when &s;he con&s;idered what
could be &s;aid, either concerning her&s;elf, or
the fate of her aunt, &s;he was equally hope|le&s;s
as to the event of her entreaty, and
terrified as to its effect upon the vengeful
&s;pirit of Montoni. Yet, to pretend igno|rance
of her death, appeared, in &s;ome de|gree,
to be &s;haring its criminality, and,
indeed, this event was the only ground,
on which Emily could re&s;t her petition
for leaving Udolpho.</P>
<P>While her thoughts thus wavered, a
me&s;&s;age was brought, importing, that mon|toni
could not &s;ee her, till the next day;
and her &s;pirits were then relieved, for_a
<PB N="39" REF="41">
moment, from an almo&s;t intolerable weight
of apprehen&s;ion. Annette &s;aid, &s;he fancied
the Chevaliers were going out to the wars
again, for the court-yard was filled with
hor&s;es, and &s;he heard, that the re&s;t of the
party, who went out before, were expected
at the ca&s;tle. &startq;And I heard one of the
&s;oldiers, too,&endq; added &s;he, &startq;&s;ay to his
comrade, that he would warrant they'd
bring home a rare deal of booty.&mdash;So,
thinks I, if the Signor can, with a &s;afe
con&s;cience, &s;end his people out a-robbing&mdash;why
it is no bu&s;ine&s;s of mine. I only
wi&s;h I was once &s;afe out of this ca&s;tle;
and, if it had not been for poor Ludovico's
&s;ake, I would have let Count Morano's
people run away with us both, for it
would have been &s;erving you a good turn,
ma'am&s;elle, as well as my&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>Annette might have continued thus
talking for hours for any interruption
&s;he would have received from Emily, who
was &s;ilent, inattentive, ab&s;orbed in thought,
and pa&s;&s;ed the whole of this day in a kind
<PB N="40" REF="42">
of &s;olemn tranquillity, &s;uch as is often the
re&s;ult of faculties over&s;trained by &s;uffer|ing.</P>
<P>When night returned, Emily recol|lected
the my&s;terious &s;trains of mu&s;ic, that
&s;he had lately heard, in which &s;he &s;till felt
&s;ome degree of intere&s;t, and of which &s;he
hoped to hear again the &s;oothing &s;weet|ne&s;s.
The influence of &s;upper&s;tition now
gained on the weaken&s;s of her long-ha|ra&s;&s;ed
mind; &s;he looked, with enthu&s;ia&s;tic
expectation, to the guardian &s;pirit of her fa|ther,
and, having di&s;mi&s;ed Annette for the
night, determined to watch alone for their
return. It was not yet, however, near the
time when &s;he had heard the mu&s;ic on a
former night, and anxious to call off her
thoughts from di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ubjects, &s;he &s;at
down with one of the few books, that &s;he
had brought from France; but her mind,
refu&s;ing controul, became re&s;tle&s;s and
agitated, and &s;he went often to the ca&s;e|ment
to li&s;ten for a &s;ound. Once, &s;he
thought &s;he heard a voice, but then, every
<PB N="41" REF="43">
thing without the ca&s;ement remaining &s;till,
&s;he concluded, that her fancy had deceived her.</P>
<P>Thus pa&s;&s;ed the time, till twelve
o'clock, &s;oon after which the di&s;tant
&s;ounds, that murmured through the ca&s;tle,
cea&s;ed, and &s;leep &s;eemed to reign over all.
Emily then &s;eated her&s;elf at the ca&s;ement,
where &s;he was &s;oon recalled from the re|verie,
into which &s;he &s;unk, by very un|u&s;ual
&s;ounds, not of mu&s;ic, but like the
low mourning of &s;ome per&s;on in diftre&s;s.
As &s;he li&s;tened, her heart faltered in terror.
and &s;he became convinced, that the former
&s;ound was more than imaginary. Still,
at intervals, &s;he heard a kind of feeble
lamentation, and &s;ought to di&s;cover whence
it came. There were &s;everal rooms under|neath,
adjoining the rampart, which had
been long &s;hut up, and, as the &s;ound
probably ro&s;e from one of the&s;e, &s;he lean|ed
from the ca&s;ement to ob&s;erve, whether
any light was vi&s;ible there. the cham|bers,
as far as &s;he could perceive, were
<PB N="42" REF="44">
quite dark, but, at a little di&s;tance, on the
rampart below, &s;he thought &s;he &s;aw &s;ome|thing
moving.</P>
<P>The faint twilight, which the &s;tars &s;hed,
did not enable her to di&s;tingui&s;h what it
was; but &s;he judged it to be a &s;entinel,
on watch, and &s;he removed her light to a
remote part of the chamber, that &s;he
might e&s;cape notice, during her further
ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The &s;ame object &s;till appeared. Pre|&s;ently,
it advanced along the rampart,
towards her window, and &s;he then diftin|gui&s;hed
&s;omething like a human form,
but the &s;ilcnce, with which it moved, con|vinced
her it was no &s;entinel. As it drew
near, &s;he he&s;itated whether to retire; a
thrilling curio&s;ity inclined her to &s;tay, but
a dread of &s;he &s;carcely knew what warned
her to withdraw.</P>
<P>While &s;he pau&s;ed, the figure came op|po&s;ite
to her ca&s;ement, and was &s;tationary.
Every thing remained quiet; &s;he had not
heard even a foot-fall; and the &s;olemnity
<PB N="43" REF="45">
of this &s;ilence, with the my&s;terious form
&s;he &s;aw, &s;ubdued her &s;pirits, &s;o that &s;he
was moving from the ca&s;ement, when,
on a &s;udden, &s;he ob&s;erved the figure &s;tart
away,. and glide down the rampart, after
which it was &s;oon lo&s;t in the ob&s;curity of
night. Emily continued to gaze, for
&s;ome time, on the way it had pa&s;&s;ed, and
then retired within her chamber, mu&s;ing
on this &s;trange circum&s;tance, and &s;carcely
doubting, that &s;he had witne&s;&s;ed a &s;upper|natural
appearance.</P>
<P>When her &s;pirits recovered compo&s;ure,
&s;he looked round for &s;ome other explana|tion.
Remembering what &s;he had heard
of the daring enterpri&s;es of Montoni, it
occurred to her, that &s;he had ju&s;t &s;een
&s;ome unhappy per&s;on, who, having been
plundered by his banditti, was brought
hither a captive; and that the mu&s;ic &s;he
had formerly heard, came from him. Yet,
if they had plundered him, it &s;till appeared
improbable, that they &s;hould have brought
him to the ca&s;tle, and it was al&s;o more con|&s;i&s;tent
<PB N="44" REF="46">
with the manners of banditti to
murder tho&s;e they rob, than to make them
pri&s;oners. But what, more than any
other circum&s;tance, contradicted the &s;up|po&s;ition,
that it was a pri&s;oner was that
it wandered on the terrrace, without a
guard a con&s;ideration, which made her
di&s;mi&s;s immediately her fir&s;t &s;urmi&s;e.</P>
<P>Afterwards, &s;he was inclined to believe,
that Count Morano had obtained ad|mittance
into the ca&s;tle; but &s;he &s;oon re|collected
the difficulties and dangers,
that mu&s;t have oppo&s;ed &s;uch an enterpri&s;e,
and that, if he had &s;o far &s;ucceeded, to
come alone and in &s;ilence to her ca&s;ement
at midnight was not the conduct he
would have adopted, particularly &s;ince
the private &s;tair-ca&s;e, communicating with
her apartment, was known to him; neither
would he have uttered the di&s;mal &s;ounds
&s;he had heard.</P>
<P>Another &s;ugge&s;tion repre&s;ented, that
this might be &s;ome per&s;on, who had de|&s;igns
<PB N="45" REF="47">
upon the ca&s;tle; but the mournful
&s;ounds de&s;troyed, al&s;o, that probability.
Thus, enquiry only perplexed her. Who,
or what, it could be that haunted this
lonely hour, complaining in &s;uch doleful
accents and in &s;uch &s;weet mu&s;ic (for &s;he
was &s;till inclined to believe, that the former
&s;trains and the late appearance were con|nected,)
&s;he had no means of a&s;certaining;
and imagination again a&s;&s;umed her em|pire,
and rou&s;ed the my&s;teries of &s;upper|&s;tition.</P>
<P>She determined, however, to watch on
the following night, when her doubts
might, perhaps, be cleared up; and &s;he,
almo&s;t re&s;olved to adder&s;s the figure, if it
&s;hould appear again.</P>

<P>ON the following day, Montoni &s;ent
a &s;econd excu&s;e to Emily, who was &s;ur|pri&s;ed
at the circum&s;tance. &startq;This is
very &s;trange!&endq; &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf. &startq;His
con&s;cience tells him, the purport of my
vi&s;it, and he defers it, to avoid an expla|nation,&endq;
She now almo&s;t re&s;olved to
throw her&s;elf in his way, but terror check|ed
the intention, and this day pa&s;&s;ed, as
the preceding one, with Emily, except
that a degree of awful expectation, con|cerning
the approaching night, now &s;ome|what
di&s;turbed the dreadful calmne&s;s that
had pervaded her mind.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="49">
Towards evening, the &s;econd part of
the band, which had made the fir&s;t ex|cur&s;ion
among the mountains, returned
to the ca&s;tle, where, as they entered the
courts, Emily, in her remote chamber,
heard their loud &s;houts and &s;trains of ex|ultation,
like the orgies of furies over &s;ome
horrid &s;acrifice. She even feared they
were about to commit &s;ome barbarous
deed; a conjecture from which, however
Annette &s;oon relieved her, by telling,
that the people were only exulting over
the plunder they had brought with them.
This circum&s;tance &s;till further confirmed
her in the belief, that Montoni had really
commenced to be a captain of banditti, and
meant to retrieve his broken fortunes by
the plunder of travellers! Indeed, when
&s;he considered all. the circum&s;tances of his
&s;ituation&mdash;in an armed, and almo&s;t in|acce&s;&s;ible
ca&s;tle, retired far among the
rece&s;&s;es of wild and &s;olitary mountains,
along who&s;e di&s;tant &s;kirts were &s;cattered
towns, and cities, whither wealthy travel|lers
<PB N="48" REF="50">
were continually pa&s;&s;ing&mdash;this appeared
to be the &s;ituation of all others mo&s;t &s;uited
for the &s;ucce&s;s of &s;chemes of rapine, and
&s;he yielded to the &s;trange thought, that
Montoni vas become a captain of robbers.
His character al&s;o, unprincipled, daunt|le&s;s,
cruel and enterpri&s;ing, &s;eemed to fit
him for the &s;ituation. Delighting in the
tumult and in the &s;truggles of life he was
equally a &s;tranger to pity and to fear; his
very courage was a &s;ort of animal ferocity;
not the noble impul&s;e of a principle, &s;uch as
in&s;pirits the mind again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;or,
in the cau&s;e of the oppre&s;&s;ed; but a con|&s;titutional
hardine&s;s of nerve, that cannot
feel, and that, therefore, cannot fear.</P>
<P>Emily's &s;uppo&s;ition, however natural,
was in part erroneous, for &s;he was a &s;tranger
to the &s;tate of this country and to the
circum&s;tances, under which its frequent
wars were partly conducted. The reve|nues
of the many &s;tates of Italy being, at
that time, in&s;ufficient to the &s;upport of
&s;tanding armies, even during the &s;hort
<PB N="49" REF="51">
periods, which the turbulent habits both
of the governments and the people permit|ted
to pa&s;s in peace, an order of men aro&s;e
not known in our age, and but faintly de|&s;cribed
in the hi&s;tory of their own. Of the
&s;oldiers, di&s;banded at the end of every war,
few returned to the &s;a&s;e, but unpro&s;itable
occupations, then u&s;ual in peace. Some|times
they pa&s;&s;ed into other countries, and
mingled with armies, which &s;till kept the
field. Sometimes they formed them&s;elves
into bands of robbers and occupied
remote fortre&s;&s;es, where their de&s;perate
character, the weakne&s;s of the govern|ments
which they offended, and the
certainty, that they could be recalled to
the armies, when their, pre&s;ence &s;hould be
again wanted, prevented them from being
much pur&s;ued by the civil power; and,
&s;ometimes, they attached them&s;elves to the
fortunes of a popular chief by whom they
were led into the &s;ervice of any &s;tate, which
could &s;ettle with. him the price of their va|lour
From this latter practice aro&s;e their
<PB N="50" REF="52">
name&mdash;<HI>condo$ieri;</HI> a term formidable all
over Italy, for a period, which concluded
in the earlier part of the &s;eventeen$ cen|tury,
but of which it is not &s;o ea&s;y to a&s;certain
the commencement.</P>
<P>Conte&s;ts between the &s;maller &s;tates were
then, for the mo&s;t part, affairs of enter|prize
alone, and the probabilities of &s;ucce&s;s
were e&s;timated, not from the &s;kill
but from the per&s;onal courage of the ge|neral,
and the &s;oldiers. The ability
which was nece&s;&s;ary to the-conduct of te|dious
operations, was little valued. It
was enough to know how a party might
be led towards their enemies, with the
greate&s;t &s;ecre&s;y, or conducthed from them
in the compacte&s;t order. The officer was
to precipitate him&s;elf into a &s;icuation,
where, but for his example, the &s;oldiers
might not have ventured; and, as the op|po&s;ed
parties knew little of each other's
&s;trength, the event of, the day was fre|quently
determined by the boldne&s;s of
the fir&s;t movements. In &s;uch &s;ervices the
<PB N="51" REF="53">
<HI>Condottieri</HI> were eminent, and in the&s;e, where
plunder always followed &s;ucce&s;s, their cha|racters
acquired a mixture of intrepidity
and profligacy, which awed even tho&s;e
whom they &s;ervcd.</P>
<P>When they were not thus engaged,
their chief had u&s;ually his own &s;oitre&s;s, in
which, or in its neighbourhood, they en|joyed
an irk&s;ome re&s;t and, though their
wants were, at one time, partly &s;upplied
from the property of the inhabitants, the
lavi&s;h distribution of their plunder at
others, prevented them from being ob|noxious;
and the pea&s;ants of &s;uch di&s;tricts
gradually &s;hared the character of their
warlike vi&s;itors. The neighbouring go|vernments
&s;ometimes p&s;ofe&s;&s;ed, but &s;el|dom
endeavoured, to &s;uppre&s;s the&s;e mili|tary
communities; both becau&s;e it was
difficult to do &s;o, and becau&s;e a di&s;gui&s;ed
protection of them en&s;ured, for the &s;er|vice
of their wars, a body of men, who
could not otherwi&s;e be &s;o cheaply main|tained
or &s;o per&s;ectly qualified. The
<PB N="52" REF="54">
commanders &s;ometimes even relied &s;o far
upon this policy of the &s;everal powers,
as to frequent their capitals; and Mon|toni,
having met them in the gaming par|ties
of Venice and Padua, conceived a de|&s;ire
to emulate their characters, before his
ruined fortunes tempted him to adopt their
practices. It was for the arrangement of
his pre&s;ent plan of life, that the midnight
councils were held at his man&s;ion in Ve|nice,
and at which Or&s;ino and &s;ome
other members of the pre&s;ent community then
a&s;&s;i&s;ted with &s;ugge&s;tions, which they had
&s;ince executed with the wreck of their
fortunes.</P>
<P>On the return of night, Emily re&s;umed
her &s;tation at the ca&s;ement. There was
now a moon; and, as it ro&s;e over the
tu&s;ted woods, its yellow light &s;erved to
&s;hew the lonely terrace and the &s;urround|ing
objects, more di&s;tinctly, than the twi|light
of the &s;tars had done, and promi&s;ed
Emily to a&s;&s;i&s;t her ob&s;ervations, &s;hould
the my&s;terious form return. On this &s;ub|ject,
<PB N="53" REF="55">
&s;he again wavered in corrjecture, and
he&s;itated whether to &s;peak to the figure, to
which a &s;lrong and almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible in|tere&s;t
urged her; but terror, at intervals,
made her reluctant to do &s;o.</P>
<P>&startq;If this is a per&s;on who has de&s;igns
upon the ca&s;tle,&endq; &s;aid &s;he,-&startq;my curio&s;ity
may prove fatal to me; yet the rny&s;te|rious
mu&s;ic, and the lamentations I heard,
mu&s;t &s;urely have proceeded from him:
if &s;o, he cannot be an enemy.&endq;</P>
<P>She then thought of her unfortunate
aunt, and, &s;huddering wich grief and horror,
the &s;ugge&s;tions of imagination &s;eized hermind with all the force of truth, and &s;he be|lieved,
that the form &s;he had &s;een was &s;u|pernatural.
She trembled, breathed with
difficulty, an icy coldne&s;s touched her
cheeks, and her fears for a while over|came
her judgment. Her re&s;olution now
for&s;ook her, and &s;he determined, if the
figure &s;hould appear, not to &s;peak to it.</P>
<P>Thus the time passed, as &s;he &s;at at her
ca&s;ement, awed by expectation, and by
<PB N="54" REF="56">
the gloom and &s;tillne&s;s of midnight; for
&s;he &s;aw ob&s;eurely in the moon-light only
the mountains and woods, a clu&s;ter of
towers, that &s;ormed the we&s;t angle of the
ca&s;tle, and the terrace below; and heard
$o &s;ound, except, now and then, the
$onely watch-word, pa&s;&s;ed by the centinels
on duty, and afterwards the &s;leps of the
men who came to relieve guard, and whom
&s;he knew at a di&s;tance. on the rampart by
their pikes, that glittered in the moon|beam,
and then, by the few &s;hort words,
in. which they hailed their fellows of the
night. Emily retired within her chamber,
while they ps&s;&s;ed the ca&s;ement. When
&s;he returned to it, all was again quiet. It
was now very late, she was wearied with
watching, and began to doubt the reality
of what &s;he had &s;een on the preceding
night; but &s;he &s;till lingered at the window,
for her mind was too perturbed to admit
of &s;leep. The moon &s;hone with a clear
lu&s;tre, that afforded her a complete view
of the terrace; but &s;he &s;aw only a &s;olitary
ccntinel, pacing at one. end of it and, at
<PB N="55" REF="57">
length, tired with expectation, &s;he with|drew
to &s;eek re&s;t.</P>
<P>Such, however, was the impre&s;&s;ion, left
on her mind by the mu&s;ic, and the com|plaining
&s;he had formerly heard, as well as
by the figure, which &s;he fancied &s;he had
&s;een, that &s;he determined to repeat the
watch, on the following night.</P>
<P>Montoni, on the next day, took no
notice of Emily's appointed vi&s;it, but &s;he,
more anxious than before to &s;ee him, &s;ent
Annette to enquire, at what hour he would
admit her. He mentioned eleven o'clock,
and Emily was punctual to the moment;
at which &s;he called up all her fortitude to
&s;upport the &s;hock of his pre&s;ence and the
dread&s;ul recollections it enforced. He
was with &s;everal of his officers, in the cedar|room
on ob&s;erving whom &s;he pau&s;ed; and her
agitation increa&s;ed, while he con|tinned
to conver&s;e with them, apparently
not ob&s;erving her, till &s;ome of his officers,
turning round, &s;aw Emily, and uttered an
exclamation. She was ha&s;tily retiring,
<PB N="56" REF="58">
when Montoni's voice arre&s;ted her, and,
in a faultering accent,&s;he &s;aid,&mdash;&startq;I would
peak with you, Signor Montoni, if you are
at lei&s;ure.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The&s;e are my friends,&endq; he replied,
&startq;whatever you would fay&endq;, they may
heir&endq;</P>
<P>Emily, Without replying, turned from
the rude gaze of the cheva$irs, and Mon|toni
then followed her to the hall, whence
he led her to a &s;mall room, of which he
&s;hut the door with violence As &s;he
looked on his dark countenance, &s;he again
thought &s;he &s;aw the murderer of her aunt;
and her mind was &s;o convul&s;ed with horror,
that &s;he had not power to recal thought
enough to explain the purport of her vi&s;it;
and to tru&s;t her&s;elf with the mention of
Madame Montoni was more than &s;he
dared.</P>
<P>Montoni at length impatiently enquired
what &s;he had to &s;ay? &startq;1 have no time
for trifling,&endq; he added, &startq;my moments
are important.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="59">
Emily then told him, that &s;he wi&s;hed to
return to France, and came to beg, that
he would permit her to do &s;o.&mdash;But when,
he looked &s;urpri&s;ed, and enquired for the
motive of the reque&s;t, &s;he he&s;itated, be|came
paler than before, trembled, and had
nearly &s;unk at his feet. He ob&s;erved her
emotion, with apparent indifference, and
interrupted the &s;ilerice by telling her, he
mu&s;t be gone. Emily, however, recalled
her &s;pirits &s;uffciently to enable her to re|peat
her reque&s;t. And, when Montoni
ab&s;olutely re&s;u&s;ed it, her &s;lumbering mind
was rou&s;ed.</P>
<P>&startq;I can no longer remain here with pro|priety,
fir,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &startq;and I may be al|lowed
to a&s;k, by what right you detain
me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is my will that you remain here,&endq;
&s;aid Montoni, laying his hand on the door
to go;&startq;let that &s;uffice you.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily, con&s;idering that &s;he had no ap|peal
from this will, forbore to di&s;pute his
right, and made a feeble effort to per&s;uade
<PB N="58" REF="60">
him to be ju&s;t. &startq;while my aunt lived,
fir,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, in a tremulous voice, &startq;my
re&s;idence here was not improper; but now,
that &s;he is no more, I may &s;urely be per|mitted
to depart. My &s;tay cannot bene|fit
you, &s;ir, and will only di&s;tre&s;s me,&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Who told you, that Madam Montoni
was dead?&endq; &s;aid Montoni, with an inqui|fitive
eye. Emily he&s;itated, for nobody
had told her &s;o, and &s;he did not dare to
avow the having &s;een that &s;pectacle in the
portal-chamber, which had compelled her
to the belief.</P>
<P>&startq;Who told you &s;o?&endq; he repeated, more|&s;ternly.</P>
<P>&startq;Alas! I know it too well,&endq; replied
Emily: &startq;&s;pare me on this terrible &s;ub|ject!&endq;</P>
<P>She fat down on a bench to &s;upport
her&s;elf.</P>
<P>&startq;If you with to fee her,&endq; &s;aid Montoni,
&startq;you may; &s;he lies in the ea&s;t turret.</P>
<P>He now left the room, without awaiting
her reply, and returned to the cedar cham|ber,
<PB N="59" REF="61">
ber, where &s;uch of the chevaliers as had
not before &s;een Emily, began to rally him,
on the di&s;covery they had made; but Mon|toni
did not appear di&s;poled to bear this
mirth, and they changed the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Having talked with the &s;ubtle Or&s;ino,
on the plan of an excur&s;ion, which he
meditated for a &s;uture day, his friend ad|vifed,
that they &s;ould lie in wait for the
enemy, which Verezzi impetuou&s;ly op|pofed,
reproached Or&s;ino with want of
&s;pirit, and &s;wore, that, if Montoni would
let him lead on fifty men, he would con|quer
all that &s;hould oppo&s;e him.</P>
<P>Or&s;ino &s;miled contemptuously;Mon|toni
&s;miled too, but he al&s;o li&s;bened. Ve|rezzi
then proceeded with vehement decla|mation
and a&s;ertion, till he was &s;topped
by an argument of Or&s;ino, which he knew
not how to an&s;wer better than by invective.
His &s;ierce &s;pirit dete&s;ted the cunning cau|tion
of Or&s;ino, whom he con&s;tantly op|pofed,
and who&s;e inveterate, though &s;ilent,
hatred he had long ago incurred. And
<PB N="60" REF="62">
Montoni was a calm ob&s;erver of both,
who&s;e different qualifications he knew,
and how to bend their oppo&s;ite character
to the perfection of his own de&s;igns. But
Verezzi, in the heat of oppo&s;icion, now
did not &s;cruple to accu&s;e Or&s;ino of cow|ardice,
at which the countenance of the
latter, while he made no reply, was over|&s;pread
with a livid palene&s;s; and Mon|toni,
who watched his lurking eye, &s;aw
him put his hand ha&s;tily into his bo&s;orn.
But Verezzi, who&s;e face, glowing with
crim&s;on, formed a &s;triking contra&s;t to the
complexion of Or&s;ino, remarked not the
action, and continued boldly declaiming
again&s;t cowards to Cavigni,. who was &s;lily
laughing at his vehemence, and at the
&s;ilent mortification of Or&s;ino, when the
latter, retiring a few &s;teps behind, drew
forth, a &s;tilletto to &s;tab his adver&s;ary in: the
$back. Montoni arre&s;ted his half-extended
arm, and, with a &s;igni&s;icant look, made
him return the poinard into his bo&s;om,
un&s;een by all except him&s;elf; for mo&s;t of
<PB N="61" REF="63">
the party were di&s;puting at a di&s;tant win|dow,
on the &s;ituation of a dell where they meant
to form an ambu&s;cade.</P>
<P>When$ Verezzi had turned round, the
deadly hatred, expre&s;&s;ed on the features of
his opponent, raifing, for the fir&s;t time, a
&s;u&s;picion of his intention, he laid his
hand on his &s;word, and then, &s;eerning to
recollect him&s;elf, &s;trode up to Montoni.</P>
<P>&startq;Signor,&endq; &s;aid he, with a &s;ignificant
look at Or&s;ino, &startq;we are not a band of a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;ins;
if you have bu&s;ine&s;s for brave men
employ me on this expedition: you &s;hall
have the laft drop of my blood; if you
have only work for cowards&mdash;keep him,&endq;
pointing to Or&s;ino, &startq;and let me quit
Udolpho.&endq;</P>
<P>Or&s;ino, &s;till more incen&s;ed, again drew
forth his &s;tilletto, and ru&s;hed towards Ve|rezzi,
who, at the fame in&s;tant, advanced
with his &s;word, when Montoni and the re&s;t
of the party interfered and eparated them.</P>
<P>&startq;This is the conduct of a boy,&endq; &s;aid
<PB N="62" REF="64">
Montoni to Verezzi, &startq;not of a man: be
more moderate in your &s;peech.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Moderation is the virtue of cowards,&endq;
retorted Verezzi; &startq;they are moderate
in every thting&mdash;but in fear.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I accept your words,&endq; raid Montoni,
turning upon him with a fierce and haughty
look, and drawing his &s;word out of the
$cabbard.</P>
<P>&startq;With all my heart,&endq; cried Verezzi,
&startq;though I did not mean them for you.&endq;</P>
<P>He directed a pa&s;s at Montoni; and,
while they fought, the villain Or&s;ino made
another attempt to &s;tab Verezzi, and was
again prevented.</P>
<P>The combatants were, at length, &s;epa|rated;
and, after a very long and violent
di&s;pute, reconciled. Montoni then left
the room with Or&s;ino, whom he detained in
private con&s;ultation for a con&s;iderable time.</P>
<P>Emily, meanwhile, &s;tunned by the la&s;t
words of Montoni, forgot, for the moment,
his declaration, that &s;he &s;hould continue in
<PB N="63" REF="65">
the ca&s;tle, while &s;he thought of her unfor|tunate
aunt, who, he had &s;aid, was laid in
the ea&s;t turret. In &s;uffering the remains
of his wife to lie thus long unburied, there
appeared a degree of brutality more &s;hock|ing
than &s;he had &s;upected even Montoni could practi&s;e</P>
<P>After a long &s;truggle, &s;he determined to
accept his permi&s;&s;ion to vi&s;it the turret,
and to take a la&s;t look of her ill-fated aunt:
with which de&s;ign &s;he returned to her
chamber, and, while &s;he waited for An|nette
to accompany her, endeavoured to
acquire fortitude &s;ufficient to &s;upport her
through the approaching &s;eene; for,
though &s;he trembled to encounter it, &s;he
knew that to remember the performance of
this la&s;t act of duty would hereafter afford
her con&s;oling &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Annette came, and Emily mentioned
her purpo&s;e, frorn whieh the former en|deavoured
to di&s;&s;uade her, though without
effect, and Annette was, with much difficulty,
prevailed upon to acconapany
<PB N="64" REF="66">
her to the turret; but no con&s;ideration
could make her promi&s;e to enter the cham|ber
of death.</P>
<P>They now le&s;t the corridor, and, having
reached the foot of the &s;tair-ca&s;e, which
Emily had formerly a&s;cended, Annette
declared &s;he would go no further, and
Emily proceeded alone. When &s;he &s;aw
the track of blood, which &s;he had before
job&s;erved, her &s;pirits fainted, and, being
compelled to re&s;t on the &s;tairs, &s;he almo&s;t
determined to proceed no further. The
pau&s;e of a few moments re&s;tored her re&s;olu|tion,
and &s;he went on.</P>
<P>As &s;he drew near the landings|place,
upon which the upper chamber opened,
&s;he remembered, that the door was formerly
fa&s;tened, and apprehended, that it might
&s;till be &s;o. In this expectation, however,
&s;he was mi&s;taken; for the door opened
at once, into a du&s;ky and &s;ilent chamber,
round which &s;he fearfully looked, and
then &s;lowly advanced, when a hollow voice
&s;poke. Emily, who was unable to &s;peak,
<PB N="65" REF="67">
or to move from the &s;pot, uttered no found
of terror. The voice &s;poke again; and,
then, thinking that it re&s;embled that of Ma|dame
Montoni, Emily's &s;pirits were in&s;tantly
rou&s;ed; &s;he ru&s;hed towards a bed, that
&s;tood in a remote part of the room, and
drew a&s;ide the curtains Within, appeared
a pale and emaciated face. She &s;tarted
back, then again advanced, &s;huddered as
&s;he took up the &s;keleton hand, that lay
&s;tretched upon the quilt; then let it drop,
and then viewed the face with a long, un|fettled
gaze. It was that of Madam Mon|toni,
though &s;o changed by illne&s;s, that the
re&s;emblance of what it had been, could
&s;carcely be traced in what it now appeared.
She was &s;till alive, and, rai&s;ing her heavy
eyes, &s;he turned them on her niece.</P>
<P>&startq;Where have you been &s;o long?&endq; &s;aid
&s;he, in the &s;ame hollow tone, &startq;I thought
you had for&s;aken me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Do you indeed live,&endq; &s;aid Emily, at
length, &startq;or is this but a terrible appari|tion?&endq;
She received no an&s;wer, and again
<PB N="66" REF="68">
&s;he &s;natched up the hand. &startq;This is &s;ub|&s;tance,&endq;
&s;he exclaimed, &startq;but it is cold&mdash;cold
as marble!&endq; She let it fall &startq;O,
if you really live, &s;peak!&endq; &s;aid Emily, in a
voice of de&s;peration, &startq;that I may not
lo&s;e my &s;en&s;es&mdash;&s;ay you know me!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I do live,&endq; replied Madame Montoni,
&startq; but&mdash;I feel that I am about to die.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily cla&s;ped the hand &s;he held, more
eagerly, and groaned. They were both
&s;ilent for &s;ome moments. Then Emily
endeavoured to &s;oo ther her, and, enquired&punc;
what had reduced her to this pre&s;ent de|plorable
&s;tate.</P>
<P>Montoni, when he removed her to the
turret under the improbable &s;u&s;picion of
having attempted his life, had ordered the
men employed on the occa&s;ion, to ob&s;erve
a &s;trict &s;ecrecy concerning her. To this
be was influenced by a double motive.
He meant to debar her from the comfort of
Emily's vi&s;its, and to &s;ecure an opportunity
of privately di&s;patching her, &s;hould any
new circum&s;tances occur to confirm the
<PB N="67" REF="69">
pre&s;ent &s;ugge&s;tions of his &s;u&s;peting mind.
His con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the hatred he de&s;erved
it was natural enough &s;hould at fir&s;t lead
him to attribute to her the attempt that
had been made upon his life; and, though
there was no other rea&s;on to believe that
&s;he was concerned in that atrocious de&s;ign,
his &s;u&s;picions remained; he continued to
confine her in the turret, under a &s;trict
guard; and, without pity or remor&s;e, had
&s;uffered her to lie, forlorn and neglected,
under a raging fever, till it had reduced
to the pre&s;ent &s;tate.</P>
<P>The track of blood, which Emily had
&s;een on the &s;tairs, had flowed from the un|bound
wound of one of the men employed
to carry Madame Montoni, and which he
had received in the late affray. At night
the&s;e men, having contented them&s;elves
with &s;ecuring the door of their pri&s;oner's
room, had retired from guard; and then
it was, that Emily, at the time of her fir&s;t
enquiry, had found the turret &s;o &s;ilent and
de&s;erted.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="70">
When &s;he had attempted to open the
door of the chamber, her aunt was &s;leep|ing,
and this occa&s;ioned the &s;ilence, which
had contributed to delude her into a belief
that &s;he was no more; yet had her terror
permitted her to per&s;evere longer in the
call, &s;he would probably have awakened
Madame Montoni, and have been &s;pared
much &s;uffering. The &s;pectacle in the
portal-chamber, which afterwards con|firmed
Emily's horrible &s;u&s;picion, was the
corp&s;e of a man, who had fallen in the af|fray,
and the &s;ame which had been borne
into the &s;ervants' hall, where &s;he took re|fuge
from the tumult. This man had lin|gered
under his wounds for &s;ome days;
and, &s;oon after his death, his body had
been removed on the couch, on which he
died, for interment in the vault beneath
the chapel, through which Emily and Bar|nardine
had pa&s;&s;ed to the chamber.</P>
<P>Emily, after a&s;king Madame Montoni a
thou&s;and questions concerning her&s;elf, le&s;t
her, and &s;ought Montoni; for the more
<PB N="69" REF="71">
&s;olemn intere&s;t &s;he felt for her aunt, made
her now regardle&s;s of the re&s;entment her
remon&s;trances might draw upon her&s;elf,
and of the improbability of his granting
what &s;he meant to entreat.</P>
<P>&startq;Madame Montoni is now dying, fir,&endq;
&s;aid Emily, as &s;oon as the &s;aw him&mdash;&startq;Your
re&s;entment, &s;urely will not pur&s;ue her to
the la&s;t moment! Suffer her to be removed
from that forlorn room to her own apart|ment,
and to have nece&s;&s;ary comforts ad|mini&s;tcred.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Of what &s;ervice will that be, if &s;he is
dying?&endq;: &s;aid Montoni, with apparent in|difference.</P>
<P>&startq;The &s;ervice, at lea&s;t, of &s;aving you,
&s;ir, from a few of tho&s;e pangs of con&s;cience
you mu&s;t &s;uffer, when you &s;hall be in the
&s;ame &s;ituation,&endq; &s;aid Emily, with impru|dent
indignation, of which Montoni &s;oon
made her &s;en&s;ible, by commanding her to
quit his pre&s;ence. Then, forgetting her re|&s;entment,
and impre&s;&s;ed only by compa&s;&s;ion
for the piteous &s;tate of her aunt, dying
<PB N="70" REF="72">
Without &s;uccour, &s;he &s;ubmitted to humble
her&s;elf to Montoni, and to adopt every
per&s;ua&s;ive means, that might reduce him to
relent towards his wife.</P>
<P>For a con&s;iderable time he was proof
again&s;t all &s;he &s;aid, and all &s;he looked;
but at length the divinity of pity, beam|ing
in Emily's eyes, &s;eemed to touch his
heart. He turned away, a&s;hamed of his
better feelings, half fallen and half relent|ing;
but finally con&s;ented, that his wife
&s;hould be removed to her own apartment,
and that Emily &s;hould attend her. Dread|ing
equally, that this relief might arrive too
late, and that Montoni might retract his
conceffion, Emily &s;carcely &s;taid to thank
him for it, but a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Annette, &s;he
quickly prepared Madame Montoni's bed,
and they carried her a cordial, that might
enable her feeble frame to &s;u&s;tain the fa|tigue
of a removal.</P>
<P>Madame was &s;carcely arrived in her
own apartment, when an order was given
by her hu&s;band, that &s;he &s;hould remain in
<PB N="71" REF="73">
the turret; but Emily, thank&s;ul that &s;he
had made &s;uch di&s;patch, ha&s;tened to inform
him of it, as well as that a &s;econd removal
would in&s;tantly prove fatal, and he suffered
his wife to continue where &s;he was.</P>
<P>During this day, Emily never left
Madame Montoni, except to prepare
&s;uch little nouri&s;hing things as &s;he
judged nece&s;&s;ary to &s;u&s;tain her, and which
Madame Montoni received with quiet ac|quie&s;cence,
though &s;he feemed &s;en&s;ible
that they could not &s;ave her from approach|ing
di&s;&s;olution, and &s;carcely appeared to
wi&s;h. for life. Emily meanwhile watched
over her with the mo&s;t tender &s;olicitude,
no longer &s;eeing her imperious aunt in
the poor object before her, but the sister of
her late beloved father, in a &s;ituation
that called for all her compa&s;&s;ion and
kindne&s;s. When night came, &s;he deter|mined
to &s;it up with her aunt, but this the
latter po&s;itively forbade, commanding her
to retire to re&s;t, and Annette alone to re|main
in her chamber. Re&s;t was, indeed,
<PB N="72" REF="74">
nece&s;&s;ary to Emily, who&s;e &s;pirits and
frame were equally wearied by the occur|rences
and exertions of the day; but &s;he
would not leave Madame Montoni, till
after the turn of midnight, a period then
thought fo critical by the phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>Soon after twelve, having enjoined
Annette to be wake&s;ul, and to call her,
&s;hould any change appear for the wor&s;e,
Emily &s;orrowfully bade Madame Montoni
good night, and withdrew to her cham|ber.
Her &s;pirits were more than u&s;ually
depre&s;&s;ed by the piteous condition of her
aunt, who&s;e recovery &s;he &s;carcely dared to
expect. To her own misfortunes &s;he &s;aw
no period, inclo&s;ed as &s;he was, in a re|mote
ca&s;tle, beyond the reach of any
friends, had &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch, and be|yond
the pity even of &s;trangers; while
&s;he knew her&s;elf to be in the power of a
man capable, of any action, which his in|tere&s;t,
or his ambition, might &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>Occupied by melancholy reflections and
<PB N="73" REF="75">
by anticipations as fad, &s;he did not retire
immediately to re&s;t, but leaned thought|fully
on her open ca&s;ement. The &s;cene
before her of woods and mountains, re|po&s;ing
in the moon-light, formed a re|gretted
contra&s;t with the &s;tate of her mind;
but the lonely murmur of the&s;e woods, and
the view of this &s;leeping land&s;cape, gra|dually
&s;oothed her emotions and &s;o&s;tened
her to tears.</P>
<P>She continued to weep, for &s;ome time,
lo&s;t to every thing, but to a gentle &s;en00e of
her misfortunes. When &s;he, at length,
took the handkerchief from her eyes, &s;he
perceived, before her, on the terrace
below, the figure &s;he had formerly ob|&s;erved,
which &s;tood fixed and &s;ilent im|mediately
oppo&s;ite to her ca&s;ement. On
perceiving it, &s;he &s;tarted back, and terror
for &s;ome time overcame curio&s;ity;&mdash;at
length, &s;he returned to the ca&s;ement, and
&s;till the figure was before it, which &s;he
now compelled her&s;elf to ob&s;erve, but was
utterly unable to &s;peak, as &s;he had for|merly
intended. The moon &s;hone with
<PB N="74" REF="76">
a clear light, and it was, perhaps, the
agitation of her mind, that prevented her
di&s;tingui&s;hing, with any degree of accuracy,
the form before her. It was &s;till &s;tation|ary,
and &s;he began to doubt, whether it
was really animated.</P>
<P>Her &s;cattered thoughts were now &s;o far
returned as to remind her, that her light ex|po&s;ed
her to dangerous ob&s;ervation, and &s;he
was &s;tepping back to remove it, when &s;he
perceived the figure move, and then wave
what &s;eemed to be its arm, as if to beckon
her; and, while &s;he gazed, fixed in fear,
it repeated the action. She now attempted
to &s;peak, but the words died on her lips,
and &s;he went from the ca&s;ement to remove
her light; as &s;he was doing which, &s;he
heard, from without, a faint groan. Li&s;ten|ing
but not daring to return, &s;he pre|&s;ently
heard it repeated.</P>
<P>&startq;Good God!&mdash;what can this mean!&endq;
&s;aid he.</P>
<P>Again &s;he li&s;tened, but the &s;ound came
no more; and, after along interval of
&s;ilence, &s;he recovered courage enough to
<PB N="75" REF="77">
go to the ca&s;ement, when &s;he again few
the &s;ame appearance! It beckoned again,
and again uttered a low found.</P>
<P>&startq;That groan was &s;urely human!&endq; &s;aid
&s;he. &startq;I <HI>will</HI> &s;peak.&endq; &startq;Who is it,&endq;
cried Emily in a faint voice, &startq;that wan|ders
at this late hour?&endq;</P>
<P>The figure rai&s;ed its head but &s;uddenly
&s;tarted away, and glided down the terrace.
She watched it, for a long while, pa&s;&s;ing
&s;wi&s;tly in the moon-light, but heard no
foot&s;lep, till a &s;enrinel from the other ex|tremity
of the rampart walked &s;lowly along.
The man &s;lopped under her window, and,
looking up, called her by name. She
was retiring precipitately, but, a &s;econd
&s;mmons inducing her to reply, the &s;ol|dier
then re&s;pect&s;ully a&s;ked if the had
&s;een any thing pa&s;s. On her an&s;wering
that &s;he had; he &s;aid no more, but walked
away down the terrace, Emily following
him with her eyes, till he was loft in the
di&s;tance. But, as he was on guard, &s;he
knew he could not go beyond the rampart,
<PB N="76" REF="78">
and, therefore, re&s;olved to await his re|turn.</P>
<P>Soon after, his voice was heard, at a
di&s;tance, calling loudly; and then a voice
&s;till more di&s;tant an&s;wered, and, in the
next moment, the watch-word was given,
and pa&s;&s;ed along the terrace. As the
&s;oldiers moved ha&s;tily under the ca&s;ement,
&s;he called to enquire what had happened,
but they pa&s;&s;ed without regarding her.</P>
<P>Emily's thoughts returning to the figure
&s;he had &s;een, &startq;It cannot be a per&s;on,
who has de&s;igns upon the, ca&s;tle,&endq; &s;aid
&s;he; &startq;&s;uch an one would conduct him&s;elf
very differently. He would not venture
where &s;entinels were on watch, nor fix
him&s;elf oppo&s;ite to a window, where he
perceived he mu&s;t be ob&s;erved; much
le&s;s would he beckon, or utter a &s;ound of
complaint. Yet it cannot be a pri&s;oner,
for how could he obtain the opportunity
to wander thus?&endq;</P>
<P>If &s;he had been &s;ubject to vanity,&s;he
might have &s;uppo&s;ed this figure to be fome
<PB N="77" REF="79">
inhabitant of the ca&s;tle, who wandered un|der
her ca&s;ement in the hope of feeing her,
and of being allowed to declare his ad|migration;
but this opinion never occurred,
to Emily, and, if it had, &s;he would have
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed it as improbable, on con&s;idering,
that, when, the opportunity of &s;peaking had
occurred, it had been &s;uffered to pa&s;s in
&s;ilence; and that, even at the moment in.
which &s;he had &s;poken, the form had ab|ruptly
quitted the place.</P>
<P>While the mu&s;ed, two &s;entinels walked
up the rampart in earne&s;t conver&s;ation, of
which &s;he caught a few words, and learned
from the&s;e, that one of their comrades
had fallen down &s;en&s;ele&s;s. Soon after,
three other &s;oldiers appeared &s;lowly ad|vancing
from the bottom, of the terrace,
but &s;he heard only a low voice, that came
at intervals. As they drew near, &s;he per|ceived
this to be the voice of him, who
walked in the middle, apparently &s;upported
by his comrades; and &s;he again, called to

when enquiring what had happened.
the found of her voice, they &s;topped,
and looked up, while &s;he repeated her que&s;|tion,
and was told, that Roberto, their
fellow of the watch, had been &s;eized with
a &s;it, and that his cry, as he fell, had
cau&s;ed a fal&s;e alarm.</P>
<P>&startq;Is he &s;ubject to fits?&endq; &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, Signora,&endq; replied Roberto; &startq;but
if 1 had not, what I &s;aw was enough to
have frightened the Pope himself.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What was it?&endq; enquired Emily, trembling.</P>
<P>&startq;I cannot tell what it was, lady, or
what I &s;aw, or how it vani&s;ied,&endq; replied
the &s;oldier who &s;eemed to &s;hudder at the
recollection.</P>
<P>&startq;Was it the per&s;on, whom you followed
down the rampart, that has occa&s;ioned
you this alarm?&endq; &s;aid Emily, endeavour|ing
to conceal her own.</P>

<P>&startq;Launcelot need not talk of that,&endq;
replied Seba&s;tian, &startq;let him remember
how he &s;tood trembling, and unable to
give the <HI>word,</HI> till the man was gone. If
the man had not come &s;o &s;ilently upon us,
I would have feized him, and &s;oon made
him tell who he was.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What man?&endq; enquired Emily.</P>
<P>&startq;It was no man, lady,&endq; &s;aid Launce|lot,
who &s;tood by, &startq;but the devil him|self
as my comrade fays. What man
who does not live in the castle, could
get within the walls at midnight? Why,
I might ju&s;t. as well' pretend$ to march to
Venice, and' get among all the Senators,
when they are coun&s;elling; and I warrant
I Should have more chance of getting out
<PB N="80" REF="82">
again alive, than any fellow, that we
should catch within the gates after dark.
So I think I have proved plainly enough,
that this can be nobody that lives out of
the ca&s;tle; and now I will, prove, that it
can be no nobody that lives in the ca&s;tle
&mdash;for, if he did&mdash;why &s;hould he be afraid
to be &s;een? So after this, I hope nobody
will pretend to tell me it was anybody.
No, I &s;ay again, by holy Pope.! it was
the devil, and Seba&s;ian, there, knows this
is not the fir&s;t time we have &s;een him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;When did you &s;ee the figure, then,
before?&endq; &s;aid Emily half &s;miling, who,
though &s;he thought the conver&s;ation &s;ome|what
too much, &s;elt, an intere&s;t, which
would not permit her to conclude it.</P>
<P>&startq;About a week ago, lady,&endq; &s;aid Seba&s;|tian,
taking up the &s;lory,&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And where?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;On the rampart, lady, higher up,&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Did you pur&s;ue it, that it &s;led?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, Signora. Launcelot and I were
on watch together, and every thing was
<PB N="81" REF="83">
&s;o &s;till, you might have heard a mou&s;e
&s;tir, when, &s;uddenly, Launcelot &s;ays&mdash;Se|ba&s;tian!
do you &s;ee nothing? I turned my
head a little to the left, as it might be&mdash;thus
No, &s;ays I Hu&s;h! &s;aid Launce|lot,
&mdash;look yonder&mdash;ju&s;t by the la&s;t cannon
on the rampart! I looked, and then
thought I did &s;ee &s;omething move; but
there being no light, but what the &s;tars
gave, I could not be certain. We &s;tood
quite &s;ilent, to watch it, and pre&s;ently &s;aw
&s;omething pa&s;s along the ca&s;tle wall ju&s;t
oppo&s;ite to us!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why did not you &s;eize it, then?&endq; cried
a &s;oldier, who had &s;carcely &s;poken till now.</P>
<P>&startq;Aye, why did you not &s;eize it?&endq; &s;aid
Roberto.</P>
<P>&startq;You &s;hould have been there to have
done that,&endq; replied Seba&s;tian. &startq;You
would have been, bold enough to have
taken it by the throat, though it had been
the devil him&s;elf; we could not take &s;uch
a liberty, perhaps becau&s;e we are not so
well acquainted with him, as you are.
But, as I was &s;aying, it &s;tole by us &s;o
<PB N="82" REF="84">
quickly that we had not time to get rid
of our &s;urprise, before it was gone. Then,
we knew it was in vain to follow. We
kept con&s;tant watch all that night, but
we &s;aw it no more. Next morning, we
told &s;ome of our Comrades,. who were on
duty on other parts of the ramparts,
what we had &s;een; but they had &s;een
nothing, and laughed at us, and it was
not till to-night, that the &s;ame figure walked
again,&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Where did you lo&s;e it, friend?&endq; &s;aid
Emily to Roberto.</P>
<P>&startq;When 1, le&s;$ you, lady,&endq; replied the
man &startq;you might &s;ee me go down the
rampart, but it was not till I reached the
ea&s;t terrace, that I saw any thing. Then,
the moon &s;hining. bright, I &s;aw &s;omething
like a &s;dow &s;litting before me, as it
were, at &s;ome di&s;tance. I &s;topped, when
I turned the corner of the ea&s;t tower,
where I had &s;een this figure not a moment
before,&mdash;but it was gone! As I &s;tood,
looking through the old arch, which leads
to the ea&s;t rampart, and where I am &s;ure
<PB N="83" REF="85">
it had pa&s;&s;ed, I heard, all of a &s;udden,
&s;uch a found!&mdash;It was not like a groan,
or a cry, or a &s;hout, or any thing I ever
heard in my, life. I heard it only once,
and that was enough for me; for I know
nothing that happened after, till I found
my comrades, here, about me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Come,&endq; &s;aid Seba&s;tian, let us go to
our po&s;ts&mdash;the moon is &s;etting. Good
night, lady!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Aye, let us go,&endq; rejoined Roberto.
Good nig$it, lady.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Good$night; the holy mother guard
you!&endq; faid Emily, as &s;he clo&s;ed her ca&s;e|ment
and retired to reflect upon the &s;trange
circum&s;tance that had ju&s;t occurred, con|necting
which with what had happened on
former nights, &s;he endeavoured to derive
from the whole &s;omething more po&s;itive,
than conjecture. But her imagination
was inflamed, while her judgment was not
enlightened, and the terrors of &s;uper&s;tition.
again pervaded her mind.</P>

<Q><L>&mdash;&startq;There is one within,</L>

<L>Recounts mo&s;t horrid &s;ights, &s;een by the watch.&endq;</L>
<BIBL>JULIUS CAESAR.</BIBL></Q>
<P>IN the morning, Emily found Madame
Montoni nearly in the fame condition, as
on the preceding night; &s;he had &s;lept lit|tle,
and that little had not refre&s;hed her;
&s;he &s;miled on her niece, and &s;eemed cheered
by her pre&s;ence, but &s;poke only a few
words, and never named Montoni, who,
however, &s;oon after entered the room. His
wife, when &s;he under&s;tood that he was
there, appeared much agitated, but was en|tirely
filent, till Emily ro&s;e from a chair at
the bed-&s;ide, when &s;he begged, in a &s;ee|ble
voice, that &s;he would not leave her.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="87">
The vi&s;it of Montoni was not to &s;ooth
his wife whom he knew to be dying, or
to con&s;ble, or to a&s;k her forgivene&s;s, but to
make a la&s;t effort to procure that &s;ignature,
which would transfer her e&s;tates in Lan|guedoc,
after her death, to him rather than
to Emily. This was a &s;cene, that exhi|bited,
on his part, his u&s;ual inhumanity,
and, on that of Madame montoni, a per|fevering
&s;pirit, contending with a feeble
frame; while Emily repeatedly declared
to him her willingne&s;s to re&s;ign all claim
to tho&s;e e&s;tates, rather than that the la&s;t
hours of her aunt &s;hould be di&s;turbed by
contention. Montoni, however, did not
leave the room, till his wife, exhau&s;ted by
the obtinate di&s;pute, had fainted, and &s;he
lay &s;o long in&s;en&s;ible, that Emily began
to fear that the &s;park of life was extin|gui&s;hed.
At length, she revived, and, look|ing
feebly up at her niece, who&s;e tears were
falling over her, made an effort to &s;peak,
but her words were unintelligible, and
Emily again apprehended &s;he was dying.
<PB N="86" REF="88">
Afterwards, however, &s;he recovered her
&s;peech, and, being &s;omewhat re&s;tored by a
cordial, conver&s;ed for a con&s;iderable time,
on the &s;ubject of' her e&s;tates In France,
with clearne&s;s and preci&s;ion. She directed
her niece where to find &s;ome papers relative
to them, which &s;he had hitherto concealed
From the &s;earch of Montoni, and earne&s;tly
charged her never to &s;uffer the&s;e papers to
e&s;cape her.</P>
<P>Soon after this conver&s;ation, Madame
Montoni &s;unk into a do&s;e, and continued
&s;lumbering, till evening, when &s;he. &s;eemed
better than &s;he had been &s;ince her removal
from the turret Emily never left her, for
a moment, till, long after midnight, and
even then would not have quitted the room,
had not. her aunt entreated, that &s;he would
retire to re&s;t. She then obeyed, the more
willingly, becau&s;e her patient appeared
&s;omewhat recruited by &s;leep; and, giving
Annette the &s;ame injunction, as on the
preceding night, &s;he withdrew$ to$her own
apartment. But her &s;pirits were wake&s;ul
<PB N="87" REF="89">
and agitated, and, finding it impo&s;&s;ible to
&s;leep, &s;he determined to watch, once more,
for the my&s;terious appearance, that had &s;o
much intere&s;ted and alarmed, her.</P>
<P>It was now the &s;econd watch of the
night, and&punc; about the time when the figure
had before appeared. Emily $ heard the
pa&s;ing &s;teps of the &s;entinels, on the ram|part,
as they changed guard; and, when all
was again &s;ilent, &s;he took her &s;tation at the
ca&s;ement, leaving her lamp in a remote
part of the chamber, that &s;he might e&s;cape
notice, from without. The moon gave a
faint and uncertain light, for heavy vapours
&s;urrounded it, and, often rolling over the
di&s;k, left the &s;cene below in total dark|ne&s;s
It was- in one of the&s;e moments of
ob&s;curity, that &s;he ob&s;erved a &s;mall and
lambent flame, moving at &s;ome di&s;tance on
the terrace. While &s;he gazed, it di&s;ap|peared,
and, the moon again emerging
from the lurid and heavy thunder clouds,
&s;he turned her attention to the heavens,
where the vivid lightnings darted from
<PB N="88" REF="90">
claud to cloud, and $a&s;hed &s;ilently on the
woods below. She loved to catch, in the
momentary gleam, the gloomy land&s;cape.
Sometimes, a cloud opened its light upon
a di&s;tant mountain, and, while the &s;udden
&s;plentdout illumined all its rece&s;&s;es of
rock and wood, the re&s;t of the &s;cene re|mained
in deep &s;hadow; at others, partial
features of the ca&s;tle were revealed by the
glimp&s;e&mdash;the antient arch leading to the
ea&s;t rampart, the turret above, or the for|tifications
beyond; and then, perhaps, the
whole edi&s;ice with all its towers, its dark
ma&s;&s;y walls and pointed ca&s;ements would
appear, and vani&s;h in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>Emily, looking again upon the rampart,
perceived the &s;lame &s;he had &s;een before;
it moved onward; and, &s;oon after, &s;he
thought &s;he heard a foot&s;tep. The light
appeared and di&s;appeared frequently, while,
as &s;he watched, it glided under her cafe|ments,
and, at the fame n&s;tant, &s;he was
certain, that a foot&s;tep pa&s;&s;ed, but the
darkne&s;s did not permit her to di&s;tingui&s;h
<PB N="89" REF="91">
any object except the flame. It moved
away, and then, by a gleam of lightning,
&s;he perceived &s;ome per&s;on on the terrace.
All the anxieties of the preceding night re|turned.
This per&s;on advanced, and the play|ing
flame alternately appeared and vani&s;hed.
Emily wi&s;hed to &s;peak, to end her doubts,
whether this figure were human or &s;uper|natural;
but her courage failed as often
as &s;he attempted utterance, till the light
moved again under the ca&s;ement, and &s;he
faintly demanded, who pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>&startq;A. friend,&endq; replied a voice.</P>
<P>&startq;What friend?&endq; &s;aid Emily, somewhat
encouraged, &startq;who are you, and what is that light you carry?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am Anthonio, one of the Signor's
&s;oldiers,&endq; replied the voice.</P>
<P>&startq;And what is that tapering light you
bear?&endq; &s;aid Emily, &startq;See how it darts up|wards,&mdash;and now it vani&s;hes!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This light, lady,&endq; &s;aid the &s;oldier,
&startq;has appeared to-night as you &s;ee it, on
the point of my lance, ever &s;ince I have
<PB N="90" REF="92">
been on watch; but what it means I can
not tell.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This is very &s;trange!&endq; &s;aid. Emily.</P>
<P>&startq;My fellow-guard,&endq; continued the man,
&startq;has the &s;ame flame on his arms; he &s;ays
he has &s;ometimes &s;een it before. I never
did; I am but lately come to the ca&s;tle,
for I have not been, long a &s;oldier.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq; How does your comrade account for
it?&endq; &s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>&startq;He says it is an omen, lady, and
bodes no good.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And what harm can it bode?&endq; rejoin|ed
Emily.</P>
<P>&startq;He knows not &s;o much as that, lady.&endq;</P>
<P>Whether Emily was alarmed by this
omen, or not, &s;he certainly was relieved
from much terror by di&s;covering this man
to be only a &s;oldier on duty, and it imme|diately
occurred to her, that it might be
he, who had occa&s;ioned &s;o much alarm on
the preceding night. There were, how|ever,
&s;ome circum&s;tances, that &s;till required
explanation. As far as &s;he could judge
<PB N="91" REF="93">
by the faint moon-light, that had a&s;&s;i&s;ted
her ob&s;ervation, the figure &s;he had &s;een did
not re&s;emble this man either in &s;hape or
&s;ize; be&s;ides, &s;he-was certain it had carried
no arms. The &s;ilence of its &s;teps, if &s;teps
it had, the moaning &s;ounds, too, which it
had uttered, and its &s;trange di&s;appearance,
were circum&s;tances of my&s;terious import,
that did not apply, with probability, to a
&s;oldier engaged in the duty of his guard.</P>
<P>She now enquired of the &s;entinel, whe|ther
he had &s;een any per&s;on be&s;ides his fel|low
watch, walking on the terrace, about
midnight; and then briefly related what
&s;he had her&s;elf ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>&startq;I was not on guard that night, lady,&endq;
replied the man, &startq;but I heard of what
happened. There are among&s;t us, who
believe &s;trange things. Strange &s;tories,
too, have long been told of this ca&s;tle, but
it is no bu&s;ine&s;s of mine to repeat them;
and, for my part, I have no rea&s;on to com|plain;
our Chief does nobly by us.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="94">
&startq;I commend your prudence,&endq; &s;aid
Emily, &startq;Good night, and accept this
from me,&endq; &s;he added, throwing him a &s;mall
piece of coin, and then clofing the ca&s;e|ment
to put an end to the di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>When he was gone, &s;he opened it again,
li&s;tened with a gloomy plea&s;ure to the di&s;|tant
thunder, that began to murmur among
the mountains, and watched the arrowy
lightnings, which broke over the remoter
&s;cene. The pealing thunder rolled on|ward,
and then, reverbed by the mountains,
other thunder &s;eemed to an&s;wer from the
opposite horizon; while the accumulating
clouds, entirely concealing the moon, a&s;|&s;umed
a red &s;ulphureous tinge, that fore|told
a violent &s;torm.</P>
<P>Emily remained at her ca&s;ement, till the
vivid lightning, that now, every in&s;tant,
revealed the wide horizon and the land|&s;cape
below, made it no longer &s;afe to do
&s;o, and &s;he went to her couch; but, unable
to compo&s;e her mind to &s;leep, &s;till li&s;tened
<PB N="93" REF="95">
in &s;ilent awe to the tremendous &s;ounds,
that &s;eemed to &s;hake the ca&s;tle to its foun|dation.</P>
<P>She had continued thus for a con&s;idera|ble
time, when, amid&s;t the uproar of the
&s;torm, &s;he thought &s;he heard a voice, and,
railing her&s;elf to li&s;ten, &s;aw the chamber
door open, and Annette enter with a coun|tenance
of wild affright.</P>
<P>&startq;She is dying, ma'am&s;elle, my lady is
dying!&endq; &s;aid &s;he</P>
<P>Emily &s;tarted up, and ran to Madame
Montoni's room. &startq;When &s;he entered, her
aunt appeared to have fainted, for &s;he was
quite &s;till, and in&s;en&s;ible; and Emily with
a &s;trength of. mind, that refu&s;ed to yield to
grief, while any duty required her activity,
applied every means that &s;eemed likely to
re&s;tore. her. But the la&s;t &s;truggle was
over&mdash;&s;he was gone, for ever.</P>
<P>When Emily's perceived, that all her ef|forts
were ine&s;&s;ectual, &s;he interrogated the
terrified Annette, and learned, that Ma|dame
Montoni had fallen into a doze, &s;oon
<PB N="94" REF="96">
after Emily's departure, in which &s;he had
continued, until a few minutes before, her
death.</P>
<P>&startq;I wondered, ma'am&s;elle,&endq; &s;aid Annette,
&startq;what was the rea&s;on my lady did not
&s;eem frightened at the thunder, when I
was &s;o terrified, and I went often to the
bed to &s;peak to her, but &s;he appeared to be
a&s;leep; till pre&s;ently I heard a &s;trange
noi&s;e, and, on going to her, &s;aw &s;he was
dying.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily, at this recital, &s;hed tears. She
had no doubt but that the violent change
in the air, which the tempe&s;t produced,
had effected this fatal one, on the exhau&s;t|ed
frame of Madame Montoni.</P>
<P>After &s;ome deliberation, &s;he determined
that Montoni &s;hould not be informed of
this event till the morning, for &s;he con&s;i|dered,
that he might,; perhaps, utter &s;ome
inhuman expre&s;&s;ions,, &s;uch as in the pre|&s;ent
temper of her &s;pirits &s;he could not
bear. With Annette alone, therefore,
whom &s;he encouraged by her own exam|ple,
<PB N="95" REF="97">
&s;he performed &s;ome of the la&s;t &s;olemn
offices for the dead, and compelled her&s;elf
to watch during the night, by the body of
her decea&s;ed aunt. During this &s;olemn
period, rendered more awful by the tre|mendous
&s;torm that &s;hook the air, &s;he fre|quently
addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to Heaven for
&s;upport and protection, and her pious
prayers, we may believe, were accepted of
the God, that giveth comfort.</P>

<P>WHEN Montoni was informed of the
death of his wife, and con&s;idered that &s;he
had died without giving him the &s;ignature
&s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the accompli&s;hment of his
wi&s;hes, no &s;en&s;e of decency re&s;trained the
expre&s;&s;ion of his re&s;entment. Emily anx|iou&s;ly
avoided his pre&s;ence, and watched,
during two days and two nights, with lit|tle
intermi&s;&s;ion, by the corp&s;e of her late
aunt. Her mind deeply impre&s;&s;ed with
the unhappy fate of this object, &s;he forgot
all her faults, her unju&s;t and imperious con|duct
to her&s;elf; and, remembering only
<PB N="97" REF="99">
her &s;ufferings, thought of her only with,
tender compaffion. Sometimes, however,
&s;he could not avoid mu&s;ing upon the &s;trange
infatuation that had proved &s;o fatal to her
aunt, and had involved her&s;elf in a laby|rinth
of misfortune, from which &s;he &s;aw no
means of e&s;caping,&mdash;the marriage with
Montoni. But, when &s;he con&s;idered this
circum&s;tance, it was &startq;more in &s;orrow than
in anger,&endq;&mdash;more for the purpo&s;e of in|dulging
lamentation, than reproach.</P>
<P>In her pious cares &s;he was not di&s;turbed
by Montoni, who not only- avoided the
chamber, where the remains of his wife
were laid, but that part of the ca&s;tle ad|joining
to it, as if he had apprehended a
contagion in death. He &s;eeme. d to have
given no orders re&s;pecting the funeral, and
Emily began to fear he meant to offer a
new in&s;ult to the memory of Madame
Montoni; but from this apprehen&s;ion &s;he
was relieved, when, on the evening of the
&s;econd day, Annette informed her, that
the interment was to take place that night.
<PB N="98" REF="100">
She knew, that Montoni would not attend;
and it was &s;o very grievous to her to think
that the remains of her unfortunate aunt
would pa&s;s to the grave without one rela|tive,
or friend to pay them the la&s;t decent
rites, that &s;he determined to be deterred by
no con&s;ederations for her&s;elf, from ob&s;erv|ing
this duty. She would otherwi&s;e have
&s;hrunk from the circum&s;tance of following
them to the cold vault, to which they were
to be carried by men, who&s;e air and coun|tenances
&s;eemed to &s;tamp them for mur|derers,
at the midnight hour of &s;ilence and
privacy, which Montoni had cho&s;en for
committing, if pp&s;&s;ible, to oblivion the re|liques
of a woman, whom his har&s;h con|duct
had, at lea&s;t, contributed to de&s;troy.</P>
<P>Emily, &s;huddering with emotions of hor|ror
and grief, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Annette, pre|pared
the corp&s;e for interment; and, hav|ing
wrapt it in cerements, and covered it-with
a winding-&s;heet, they watched be&s;ide
it, till pa&s;t midnight, when they heard
the approaching footsteps. of the men, who
<PB N="99" REF="101">
were to lay it in its earthy'bed. It was
with difficulty, that Emily, overcame her
emotion, when, the door of the chamber
being thrown open, their gloomy counte|nances
were &s;een by the glare of the torch
they carried, and two of them, without
&s;peaking, lifted the body on their &s;houlders,
while the third preceding them with the
light, de&s;cended through the ca&s;tle towards
the grave, which was in the lower vault
of the chapel within the ca&s;tle walls.</P>
<P>They had to cro&s;s two courts, towards
the ea&s;t wing of the ca&s;tle, which, adjoin|ing
the chapel, was, like it, in ruins: but
the &s;ilence and gloom of the&s;e courts had
now little power over Emily's mind, oc|cupied
as it was, with more mournful
ideas; and &s;he &s;carcely heard the low and
di&s;mal hooting of the night-birds, that
roo&s;ted among the ivyed battlements of
the ruin, or perceived the &s;till flittings of
the bat, which frequently cro&s;&s;ed her way.
But, when, having entered the chapel,
and pa&s;&s;ed between the mouldering pillars of
<PB N="100" REF="102">
the ai&s;les, the bearers &s;topped at a flight of
&s;teps, that led down to a low arched door,
and, their comrade having de&s;cended to un|lock
it, &s;he &s;aw imperfectly the gloomy
aby&s;s beyond;&mdash;faw the corp&s;e of her aunt
carried down the&s;e &s;teps, and the ruffian|like
figure, that &s;tood with a torch at the
bottom to receive it&mdash;all her fortitude was
lo&s;t in emotions of inexpre&s;&s;ible grief and
terror. She turned to lean upon Annette,
who was cold and trembling like her&s;elf,
and &s;he lingered &s;o long on the &s;ummit of
the &s;light, that the gleam of the torch be|gan
to die away on the pillars of the cha|pel,
and the men were almo&s;t beyond her
view. Then, the gloom around her
awakening other fears, and a &s;en&s;e of' what
&s;he con&s;idered to be her duty overcoming
her reluctance, &s;he de&s;cended to the vaults,
following the echo of foot&s;teps and the
faint ray, that pierced the darkne&s;s, till
the har&s;h grating of a di&s;tant door, that
was opened to receive the corp&s;e, again ap|palled
her.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="103">
After the pau&s;e of a moment, &s;he went on,
and, as &s;he entered the vaults, &s;aw between
the arches, at &s;ome di&s;tance, the men lay
down the body near the edge of an open
grave, where &s;tood another of Montoni's
men and a prie&s;t, whom &s;he did not ob|&s;erve,
till he began the burial &s;ervice then,
lifting her eyes from the ground, &s;he &s;aw
the venerable figure of the friar, and heard
him in a low voice, equally &s;olemn and af|fecting,
perform the &s;ervice for the dead.
At the moment, in which they let down
the body into the earth, the &s;cene was &s;uch
as only the dark pencil of a Domenichino,
perhaps, could have done ju&s;tice to.
The fierce features and wild dre&s;s of the <HI>con|dottieri,</HI>
bending with their torches over the
grave, into which the corp&s;e was $&s;cend|ing,
were contra&s;ted by the venerable figure
of the monk, wrapt in long-black gar|ments,
his cowl thrown back from his pale
face, on which the light gleaming &s;trongly
&s;hewed the lines of affliction &s;oftened by
piety, and. the few grey locks, which time
<PB N="102" REF="104">
had &s;pared on his temples: while, be&s;ide
him, &s;tood the &s;ofter form of Emily, who
leaned for &s;upport upon Annette; her face
half averted, and &s;haded by a thin veil,
that fell over her figure; and her mild and
beautiful countenance fixed in grief &s;o &s;o|lemn
as admitted not of tears, while &s;he
thus &s;aw committed untimely to the earth
her la&s;t relative and friend. The gleams,
thrown between the arches of the vaults,
where, here and there, the broken ground
marked the &s;pots in which other bodies
had been recently interred, and the general
ob&s;curity beyond were circum&s;tances, that
alone would have led on the imagination
of a &s;pectator to &s;cenes more horrible, than
even that which was pictured at the grave
of the mi&s;guided and unfortunate Madame
Montoni.</P>
<P>When the &s;ervice was over, the friar re|garded
Emily with attention and &s;urpri&s;e,
and looked as if he wi&s;hed to &s;peak to her,
but was re&s;trained by the pre&s;ence of the
condottieri, who, as they now led the way
<PB N="103" REF="105">
to the courts, amu&s;ed them&s;elves with jokes
upon his holy order, which he endured in
&s;ilence demanding only to be conducted
&s;afely to his convent, and to which Emily
li&s;tened with concern and even horror.
When they reached the court, the monk
gave her his ble&s;&s;ing, and, after a lingering
look of pity, turned away to the portal,
whither one of the men carried a torch;
while Annette, lighting another, preceded
Emily to her apartment. The appearance
of the friar and the expre&s;&s;ion of tender
compa&s;&s;ion, with which he had regarded
her, had intere&s;ted Emily, who, though it
was at her earne&s;t &s;upplication, that Mon|toni
had con&s;ented to allow a prie&s;t to per|form
the la&s;t rites for his decea&s;ed wife,
knew nothing concerning this per&s;on, till
Annette now informed her, that, he belong|ed
to a mona&s;tery, &s;ituated among the
mountains at a few miles di&s;tance. The
Superior, who regarded Montoni and his
a&s;&s;ociates, not only with aver&s;ion, but with
terror, had probably feared to offend him
<PB N="104" REF="106">
by refu&s;ing his reque&s;t, and had, therefore,
ordered a monk to officiate at the funeral,
who, with the meek &s;pirit of a chri&s;tian,
had overcome his reluctance to enter the
walls of &s;uch a ca&s;tle, by the wi&s;h of per|forming
what he con&s;idered to be his duty,
and, as the chapel was built on con&s;e|crated
ground, had not objected to commit
to it the remains of the late unhappy Ma|dame
Montoni.</P>
<P>Several days pa&s;&s;ed with Emily in total
&s;eclu&s;ion, and in a &s;tate of mind partaking
both of terror for her&s;elf, and grief for the
departed. She, at length, determined to
make other efforts to per&s;uade Montoni to
permit her return to France. Why he
&s;hould wi&s;h to detain her, &s;he could &s;carce|ly
dare to conjecture; but it was too cer|tain
that he did &s;o, and the ab&s;olute refu&s;al
he had formerly given to her departure al|lowed
her little hope, that he would now
con&s;ent to it. But the horror, which his
pre&s;ence in&s;pired, made her defer, from day
to day, the mention of this &s;ubject; and
<PB N="105" REF="107">
at la&s;t &s;he was awakened from her inacti|vity
only by a me&s;&s;age from him, de&s;iring
her attendance at a certain hour. She be|gan
to hope he meant to re&s;ign, now that
her aunt was no more, the authority he had
u&s;urped over her; till &s;he recollected, that
the e&s;tates, which had occa&s;ioned &s;o much
contention, were now hers, and &s;he then
feared Montoni was about to employ &s;ome
&s;tratagem for obtaining them, and that he
would detain her his pri&s;oner, till he &s;uc|ceeded.
This thought, in&s;tead of over|coming
her with de&s;pondency, rou&s;ed all
the latent powers of her fortitude into ac|tion;
and the property, which &s;he would
willingly have re$$gned to &s;ecure the peace
of her aunt, &s;he re&s;olved, that no common
&s;ufferings of her own &s;hould ever compel
her to give to Montoni. For Valancourt's
&s;ake al&s;o &s;he determined to pre&s;erve the&s;e
e&s;tates, &s;ince they would afford that com|petency,
by which &s;he hoped to &s;ecure the
comfort of their future lives. As &s;he
thought of this, &s;he indulged the tendernne&s;s
<PB N="106" REF="108">
of tears, and anticipated the delight of that
moment, when, with affectionate genera|&s;ity,
&s;he might tell him they were his own.
She &s;aw the &s;mile, that lighted up his fea|tures
&mdash;the affectionate regard, which &s;poke
at once his joy and thanks; and, at this
in&s;tant, &s;he believed &s;he could brave any
&s;uffering, which the evil &s;pirit of Montoni
might be preparing for her. Remembering
then, for the fir&s;t time &s;ince her aunt's
death, the papers relative to the e&s;tates in
que&s;tion, &s;he determined to &s;earch for them,
as &s;oon as her interview with Montoni was
over.</P>
<P>With the&s;e re&s;olutions &s;he met him at
the appointed time, and waited to hear his
intention before &s;he renewed her reque&s;t.
With him were Or&s;ino and another of|ficer,
and both were &s;tanding near a table,
covered with papers, which he appeared to
be examining.</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;ent for you, Emily,&endq; &s;aid Montoni,
rai&s;ing his head, &startq;that you might be a
witne&s;s in &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s, which I am tran&s;|acting
<PB N="107" REF="109">
with my friend Or&s;ino. All that
is required of you will be to &s;ign your
name to this paper:&endq; he then took one up,
hurried unintelligibly over &s;ome lines, and;
laying it before her on the table, offered
her a pen. She took it, and was going to
write&mdash;when the de&s;ign of Montoni came
upon her mind like a flahm of lightning;
&s;he trembled, let the pen fall, and re|fu&s;ed
to &s;ign what &s;he had not read. Mon|toni
affected to laugh at her &s;cruples, and,
taking up the paper, again pretended to
read;but Emily, who &s;till trembled on
perceiving her danger, and was a&s;toni&s;hed,
that her own credulity had &s;o nearly be|trayed
her, po&s;itively refu&s;ed to &s;ign any
paper whatever. Montoni, for &s;ome time,
per&s;evered in affecting to ridicule this re|fu&s;al;
but, when he perceived by her &s;teady
per&s;everance, that &s;he under&s;tood his de|&s;ign,
he changed his manner, and bade her
follow him to another room. There he
told her, that he had been willing to &s;pare
him&s;elf and her the trouble of u&s;ele&s;s con|te&s;t,
<PB N="108" REF="110">
in an affair, where his will was ju&s;tice,
and where &s;he &s;hould find it law; and had,
therefore, endeavoured to per&s;uade, rather
than to compel, her to the practice of her
duty.</P>
<P>&startq;I, as the hu&s;band of the late Signora
Montoni,&endq; he added, &startq;am the heir of all
&s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; the e&s;tates, therefore, which
&s;he refu&s;ed to me in her life-time, can no
longer be withheld, and, for your own fake,
I would undeceive you, re&s;pecting a fooli&s;h
a&s;&s;ertion &s;he once made to you in my hear|ng
&mdash;that the&s;e e&s;tates would be yours, if
&s;he died without re&s;igning them to me.
She knew at that moment, &s;he had no
power to withhold them from me, after
her decea&s;e; and I think, you have more
&s;en&s;e, than to provoke my re&s;entment by
advancing an unju&s;t claim. I am not in
the habit of flattering, and you will, there|fore,
receive, as &s;incere, the prai&s;e I be&s;tow,
when I &s;ay, that you po&s;&s;e&s;s an under|&s;tanding
&s;uperior to that of your &s;ex; and
that you have none of tho&s;e contemptible
<PB N="109" REF="111">
foibles, that frequently mark the female
character&mdash;&s;uch as avarice and the love
of power, which latter makes women de|light
to contradict and to tea&s;e, when they
cannot conquer. If I under&s;tand your di&s;|po&s;ition
and your mind, you hold in &s;ove|reign
contempt the&s;e common failings of
your &s;ex.&endq;</P>
<P>Montoni pau&s;ed; and Emily remained
&s;ilent and expecting; for &s;he knew him
too well, to believe he would conde&s;cend
to &s;uch flattery, unle&s;s he thought it would
promote his own intere&s;t and, though he
had forborne to name vanity among the
foibles of women, it was evident, that he
con&s;idered it to be a predominant one,
&s;ince he de&s;igned to &s;acrifice to hers the
character and under&s;tanding of her whole
&s;ex.</P>
<P>&startq;Judging as I do,&endq; re&s;umed Montoni,
&startq;I cannot believe you will oppo&s;e, where
you know you cannot conquer, or, indeed,
that you would wi&s;h to conquer, or be
avaricious of any property, when you have
<PB N="110" REF="112">
not ju&s;tice on your &s;ide. I think it proper,
however, to acquaint you with the alterna|tive.
If you have a ju&s;t opinion of the
&s;ubject in que&s;tion, you &s;hall be allowed a
&s;afe conveyance to France, within a &s;hort
period; but, if you are &s;ounhappy as to
be mi&s;led by the late a&s;&s;ertion of the Sig|nora,
you &s;hall remain my pri&s;oner, till
you are convinced of your error.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily calmly &s;aid,</P>
<P>&startq;I am not &s;o ignorant, Signor, of the
laws on this &s;ubject, as to be misled by the
a&s;&s;ertion of any per&s;on. The law, in the
pre&s;ent in&s;tance, gives me the e&s;tates in
que&s;tion, and my own hand &s;hall never
betray my right.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have been mi&s;taken in my opinion
of you, it appears,&endq; rejoined Montoni,
&s;ternly. &startq;You &s;peak boldly, and pre|&s;umptuou&s;ly,
upon a &s;ubject, which you do
not under&s;tand. For once, I am willing
to pardon the conceit of ignorance; the
weakne&s;s of your &s;ex, too, from which,
it &s;eems, you are not exempt, claims &s;ome
<PB N="111" REF="113">
allowance; but, if you per&s;i&s;t in this &s;train
&mdash;you have every thing to fear from my
ju&s;tice.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;From your ju&s;tice, Signor,&endq; rejoined
Emily, &startq;I have nothing to fear&mdash;I have
only to hope.&endq;</P>
<P>Montoni looked at her with vexation,
and &s;eemed con&s;idering what to &s;ay.&startq;I
find that you are weak enough,&endq; he re&s;um|ed,
&startq;to credit the idle a&s;&s;ertion I alluded
to! For your own &s;ake I lament this; as
to me, it is of little con&s;equence. Y our
credulity can puni&s;h only your&s;elf; and I
mu&s;t pity the weakne&s;s of mind, which
leads you to &s;o much &s;uffering as you are
compelling me to prepare for you.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You may find, perhaps, Signor,&endq; &s;aid
Emily, with mild dignity, &startq;that the
&s;trength of my mind is equal to the ju&s;tice
of my cau&s;e; and that I can endure with
fortitude, when it is in re&s;i&s;tance of op|pre&s;&s;ion.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You &s;peak like a heroine,&endq; &s;aid Mon|toni,
<PB N="112" REF="114">
contemptuou&s;ly; &startq;we &s;hall &s;ee
whether you can &s;uffer like one.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily was &s;ilent, and. he left the room.</P>
<P>'Recollecting, that it was for Valancourt's
fake &s;he had thus re&s;i&s;ted, &s;he now &s;miled
complacently upon the threatened fufferings, and retired to the &s;pot, which her aunt had
pointed out as the repo&s;itory of the papers,
relative to the e&s;tates, where &s;he found
them as de&s;cribed; and, &s;ince &s;he knew of
no better place of concealment, than this,
returned them, without examining their
contents, being fearful of di&s;covery, while
&s;he &s;hould attempt a peru&s;al.</P>
<P>To her own &s;olitary chamber &s;he once
more returned, and there thought again
of the late conver&s;ation with Montoni, and
of the evil $span$ might expect from oppo&s;i|tion
to h$ will. But his power did not
appear$ terrible to her imagination, as it
was wont to do$$$ a &s;acred pride was in her
heart, that taught it to &s;well again&s;t the
pre&s;&s;ure of inju&s;tice, and almo&s;t to glory in
<PB N="113" REF="115">
the quiet &s;ufferance of ills, in a cau&s;e, which
had al&s;o the intere&s;t of Valancourt for its
object. For the fir&s;t time, &s;he felt the full
extent of her own &s;uperiority to Montoni,
and de&s;pi&s;ed the authority, which, till now,
&s;he had only feared.</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;at mu&s;ing, a peal of laughter
ro&s;e from the terrace, and, on going to the
ca&s;ement, &s;he &s;aw, with inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;ur|pri&s;e,
three ladies, dre&s;&s;ed in the gala habit
of Venice, walking with &s;everal gentlemen
below. She gazed in an a&s;toni&s;hment
that made her remain at the window, re|gardle&s;s
of being ob&s;erved, till the group
pa&s;&s;ed under it; and, one of the &s;trangers
looking up, &s;he perceived the features of
Signora Livona, with who&s;e manners &s;he
had been &s;o much charmed, the day after
her arrival at Venice, and who had been
there introduced at the table of Montoni.
This di&s;covery occa&s;ioned her an emotion
of doubtful joy; for it was matter of joy and
comfort to know, that a per&s;on, of a mind
&s;o gentle, as that of Signora Livona &s;eem|ed
<PB N="114" REF="116">
to be, was near her; yet there was
&s;omething &s;o extraordinary in her being at
this ca&s;tle, circum&s;tanced as it now was,
and evidently, by the gaiety of her air, wi$h
her own con&s;ent, that a very painful &s;ur|mi&s;e
aro&s;e, concerning her character. But
the thought was &s;o &s;hocking to Emily,
who&s;e affection the fa&s;cinating manners of
the Signora had won, and appeared &s;o im|probable,
when &s;he remembered the&s;e
manners, that &s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed it almo&s;t in|&s;tantly.</P>
<P>On Annette's appearance, however, &s;he
enquired, concerning the&s;e &s;trangers; and
the former was as eager to tell, as Emily
was to learn.</P>
<P>&startq;They are ju&s;t come, ma'am&s;elle,&endq; &s;aid
Annette, &startq;with two Signors from Venice,
and I was glad to &s;ee &s;uch Chri&s;tian faces
once again.&mdash;But what can they mean by
coming here? They mu&s;t &s;urely be &s;tark
mad to come freely to &s;uch a place as this!
Yet they do come freely, for they &s;eem
merry enough, I am &s;ure.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="117">
&startq;They were taken pri&s;oners, perhaps?&endq;
&s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>&startq;Taken pri&s;oners!&endq; exclaimed An|nette;
&startq;no, indeed, ma'am&s;elle, not they&punc;
I remember one of them very well at Ve|pice:
&s;he came two or three times, to the
Signor's, you know, ma'am&s;elle, and it was
&s;aid, but I did not believe a word of it&mdash;it
was &s;aida that the Signor liked her better
than he &s;hould do. Then why, &s;ays I,
bring her to my lady? Very true, &s;aid
Ludovico; but he looked as if he knew
more, too.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily de&s;ired Annette would endeavour
to learn who the&s;e ladies were, as well as all
&s;he could concerning them; and &s;he then
changed the &s;ubject, and &s;poke of di&s;tant
France.</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, ma'am&s;elle! we &s;hall never &s;ee it
more!&endq; &s;aid Annette, almo&s;t weeping.&mdash;
&startq;I mu&s;t come on my travels, for&s;ooth!&endq;</P>
<P>Emily tried to &s;ooth and to cheer her,
with a hope, in which &s;he &s;carcely her&s;elf
indulged.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="118">
&startq;How&mdash;how, ma'am&s;elle, could you
leave France, and leave Mon&s;. Valancourt,
too?&endq; &s;aid Annette, &s;obbing. &startq;I&mdash;I&mdash;am
&s;ure, if Ludovico had been in France, I
would never have left it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why do you lament quitting France,
then?&endq; &s;aid Emily, trying to &s;mile, &startq;&s;ince,
if you had remained there, you would not
have found Ludovico.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, ma'am&s;elle! I only wi&s;h I was out
of this frightful ca&s;tle, &s;erving you in
France, and I would care about nothing
el&s;e!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Thank you, my good Annette, for
your affectionate regard; the time&punc; will
come, I hope, when you may remember
the expre&s;&s;ion of that wi&s;h with plea&s;ure.&endq;</P>
<P>Annette departed on her bu&s;ine&s;s, and
Emily &s;ought to lo&s;e the &s;en&s;e of her own
cares, in the vi&s;ionary &s;cenes of the poet;
but &s;he had again to lament the irre&s;i&s;tible
force of circum&s;tances over the ta&s;te and
powers of the mind; and that it requires
a &s;pirit at ea&s;e to be &s;en&s;ible even to the
<PB N="117" REF="119">
ab&s;tract plea&s;ures of pure intellect. The
enthu&s;ia&s;m of genius, with all its pictured
&s;cenes, now appeared cold, and dim.
As &s;he mu&s;ed upon the book before her,
&s;he involuntarily exclaimed, &startq;Are the&s;e,
indeed, the pa&s;&s;ages, that have &s;o often
given me exqui&s;ite delight? Where did the
charm exi&s;t?&mdash;Was it in my mind, or in
the imagination of the poet? It lived in
each,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, pau&s;ing. &startq;But the fire of
the poet is vain, if the mind of his reader
is not tempered like his own, however it
may be inferior to his in power.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily would have pur&s;ued this train of
thinking, becau&s;e it relieved her from
more painful reflection, but &s;he found
again, that thought cannot always be con|trolled
by will; and hers returned to the
con&s;ideration of her own &s;ituation.</P>
<P>In the evening, not choo&s;ing to venture
down to the rarnparts, where &s;he would be
expo&s;ed to the rude gaze of Montoni's a&s;|&s;ociates,
&s;he walked for air in the gallery,
adjoining her chamber; on reaching the
<PB N="118" REF="120">
further end of which &s;he heard di&s;tant
&s;ounds of merriment and laughter. If was
the wild uproar of riot, not the cheering
gaiety of tempered mirth; and &s;eemed to
come from that part of the ca&s;tle, where
Montonj u&s;ually was. Such &s;ounds, at this
time, when her aunt had been &s;o few days
dead, particularly &s;hocked her, con&s;i&s;tent
as they were with the late conduct of
Montoni.</P>
<P>As &s;he li&s;tened, &s;he thought &s;he di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
female voices mingling with the
laughter, and this confirmed her wor&s;t
&s;urmi&s;e, concerning the character of Sig|nora
Livona and her companions. It was
evident, that they had not been brought
$ither by compul&s;ion; and &s;he beheld
her&s;elf in the remote wilds of the Apennine,
&s;urrounded by men, whom &s;he con&s;idered
to be little le&s;s than r$ffians, and their
wor&s;t a&s;&s;ociates, amid &s;cenes of vice, $rom
which her &s;oul recoiled in horror. It was
at this moment, when the &s;cenes of the pre|&s;ent
and the future opened to her imagina|tion,
<PB N="119" REF="121">
that the image of Valancourt failed in
its influence, and her re&s;olution &s;hook with
dread. She thought &s;he under&s;tood all the
horrors, which Montoni was preparing for
her, and &s;hrunk from an encounter with
&s;uch remor&s;ele&s;s vengeance, as he could in|flict.
The di&s;puted e&s;tates &s;he now almo&s;t
determined to yield at once, whenever he
&s;hould again call upon her, that &s;he might
regain &s;afety and freedom; but then, the re|membrance
of Valancourt&punc; would &s;teal to
her heart, and plunge her into the di&s;trac|tions
of doubt.</P>
<P>She continued walking in the gallery,
till evening threw its melancholy twilight
through the painted ca&s;ements, and deep|ened
the gloom of the oak wain&s;coting
around her; while the di&s;tant per&s;pective
of the corridor was &s;o much ob&s;cured, as
to be di&s;cernible only by the glimmering
window, that terminated it.</P>
<P>Along the vaulted halls and pa&s;&s;ages be|low,
peals of laughter echoed faintly, at
intervals, to this remote part of the ca&s;tle,
<PB N="120" REF="122">
and &s;eemed to render the &s;ucceeding &s;till|ne&s;s
more dreary. Emily, however, un|willing
to return to her more forlorn cham|ber,
whither Annette was not yet come,
&s;till paced the gallery. As &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the
door of the apartment, where &s;he had once
dared to lift the veil, which di&s;covered to
her a &s;pectacle &s;o horrible, that &s;he had
never after remembered it, but with emo|tions
of inde&s;cribable awe, this remem|brance
&s;uddenly recurred. It now brought
with it reflections more terrible, than it had
yet done, which the late conduct of Mon|toni
occa&s;ioned; and, ha&s;tening to quit the
gallery, While &s;he had power to do &s;o, &s;he
heard a &s;udden &s;tep behind her.&mdash;It might
be that of Annette; but, turning fearfully
to look, &s;he &s;aw, through the gloom, a tall
figure following her, and all the horrors of
that chamber ru&s;hed upon her mind. In
the next moment, &s;he found her&s;elf cla&s;ped
in the arms of &s;ome per&s;on, and heard a
deep voice murmur in her ear.</P>
<P>When &s;he had power to &s;peak, or to di&s;|tingui&s;h
<PB N="121" REF="123">
articulated &s;ounds, &s;he demanded
who detained her.</P>
<P>&startq;It is I,&endq; replied the voice&mdash;&startq;Why are
you thus alarmed?&endq;</P>
<P>She looked on the face of the per&s;on
who &s;poke, but the feeble light, that
gleamed through the high ca&s;ement at the
end of the gallery, did not permit her to
di&s;tingui&s;h the features.</P>
<P>&startq;Whoever you are,&endq; &s;aid Emily, in a
trembling voice, &startq;for heaven's &s;ake let
me go!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My charming Emily,&endq; &s;aid the man,
&startq;why will you &s;hut your&s;elf up in this
ob&s;cure place, when there is &s;o much
gaiety below? Return with me to the
cedar parlour, where you will be the faire&s;t
ornament of the party;&mdash;you &s;hall not re|pent
the exchange.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily di&s;dained to reply, and &s;till en|deavoured
to liberate her&s;elf.</P>
<P>&startq;Promi&s;e, that you will come,&endq; he
continued, &startq;and I will relea&s;e you imme|diately;
<PB N="122" REF="124">
but fir&s;t give me a reward for &s;o
doing.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Who are you?&endq; demanded&punc; Emily, in
a tone of mingled terror and indignation,
while &s;he &s;till &s;truggled for liberty&mdash;&startq;who
are you, that have, the cruelty thus to in|&s;ult
me?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why&punc; call me cruel?&endq; &s;aid the man,
&startq;I would remove you from this dreary
&s;olitude to a merry party below. Do you
not know me?&endq;</P>
<P>Emily now faintly remembered, that he
was one of the officers who were with Mon|toni
when &s;he attended him in the morn|ing.
&startq;I thank you for the kindne&s;s of
your intention,&endq; &s;he replied, without ap|pearing
to under&s;tand him, &startq;but I wi&s;h
for nothing &s;o much as that you would
leave me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Charming Emily!&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;give up
this fooli&s;h whim for &s;olitude, and come
with me to the company, and eclip&s;e the
beauties, who make part of it; you, only,
<PB N="123" REF="125">
are worthy of my love.&endq; He attempted
to ki&s;s; her hand, but the &s;trong impul&s;e of
her indignation gave her power to liberate
her&s;elf, and &s;he fled towards the chamber.
She clo&s;ed the door, before he reached it,
having &s;ecured which, &s;he &s;unk in a chair,
overcome by terror and by the exertion
&s;he had made, while &s;he heard his voice,
and his attempts to open the door, without
having the power to rai&s;e her&s;elf. At
length, &s;he perceived him depart, and had
remained, li&s;tening, for a con&s;iderable time,
and was &s;omewhat revived by not hearing
any &s;ound, when &s;uddenly &s;he remembered
the door of the private &s;tair-ca&s;e, and: that
he might enter that way, &s;ince it was fa&s;t|ened
only on the other &s;ide. She then em|ployed
her&s;elf in endeavouring to &s;ecure
it, in the manner &s;he had formerly done.
It appeared&punc; to her, that Montoni had al|ready
commenced his &s;cheme of vengeance,
by withdrawing from her his protection,
and &s;he repented of the ra&s;hne&s;s, that had
made her brave the power of &s;uch a man.
<PB N="124" REF="126">
To retain the e&s;tates &s;eemed to be now ut|terly
Impo&s;&s;ible, and to pre&s;erve her life,
perhaps her honour, &s;he re&s;olved, if &s;he
&s;hould e&s;cape the horrors of this night, to
give up all claims to the e&s;tates, on the
morrow, provided Montoni would &s;uffer
her to depart from Udolpho.</P>
<P>When &s;he had come to this deci&s;ion,
her mind became more compo&s;ed, though
&s;he &s;till anxiou&s;ly li&s;tened, and often &s;tarted
at ideal &s;ounds, that appeared to i&s;&s;ue
from the &s;tair-ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Having &s;at in darkne&s;s for &s;ome hours,
during all which time Annette did not ap|pear,
&s;he began to have &s;erious apprehen|&s;ions
for her; bu, not daring to venture
down into the ca&s;tle, was compelled to re|main
in uncertainty, as to the cau&s;e of this
unu&s;ual ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>Emily often &s;tole to the &s;tair-ca&s;e door,
to li&s;ten if any &s;tep approached, but &s;till no
&s;ound alarmed her: determining, however,
to watch, during the night, &s;he once more
re&s;ted on her dark and de&s;olate couch,
<PB N="125" REF="127">
and bathed the pillow with innocent tears.
She thought of her decea&s;ed parents and
then of the ab&s;ent Valancourt, and fre|quently
called upon their names; for the
profound &s;tillne&s;s that now reigned, was
propitious to the mu&s;ing &s;orrow of her
mind.</P>
<P>&startq;While &s;he thus remained, her ear &s;ud|denly
caught the notes of di&s;tant mu&s;ic, to
which &s;he li&s;tened attentively, and, &s;oon
perceiving this to be the in&s;trument &s;he
had formerly heard at midnight, &s;he ro&s;e,
and &s;tepped &s;oftly to 'the ca&s;ement, to
which the &s;ounds appeared to come from
a lower room.</P>
<P>In a few moments, their &s;oft melody
was accompanied by a voice &s;o full of
pathos, that it evidently &s;ang not of ima|ginary
&s;orrows. Its &s;weet and peculiar
tones &s;he thought &s;he had &s;omewhere heard
before yet, if this was not fancy, it was,
at mo&s;t, a very faint recollection. It &s;tole
over her mind, amid&s;t the angui&s;h of
her pre&s;ent &s;uffering, like a cele&s;tial &s;train,
<PB N="126" REF="128">
&s;oothing, and re-a&s;&s;uring her;&mdash;&startq;Plea|&s;ant
as the gale of &s;pring, that fighs
on the hunter's ear, when he awakens from
dreams of joy, and has heard the mu&s;ic of
the &s;pirits of the hill* ossian.&endq;</P>
<P>But her emotion can &s;carcely be imagin|ed,
when &s;he heard &s;ung, with the ta&s;te and
&s;implicity of true feeling, one of the po|pular
airs of her native province, to which
&s;he had &s;o often li&s;tened with delight,
when a child, and which &s;he had &s;o of|ten
heard her father repeat! To this well|known
&s;ong, never, till now, heard but in
her native country, her heart melted, while
the memory of pa&s;t times returned. The
plea&s;ant, peaceful &s;cenes of Ga&s;cony, the
tenderne&s;s and goodne&s;s of her parents, the
ta&s;te and &s;implicity of her former life&mdash;all
ro&s;e to her fancy, and formed a picture,
&s;o &s;weet and glowing, &s;o &s;trikingly con|tra&s;ted
with the &s;cenes, the characters and
the dangers, which now &s;urrounded her&mdash;
that her mind could not bear to pau&s;e up|on
<PB N="127" REF="129">
the retro&s;pect, and &s;hrunk at the acute|ne&s;s
of its own &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>Her &s;ighs were deep and convul&s;ed; &s;he
could no longer li&s;ten to the &s;train, that
had &s;o often charmed her to tranquillity,
and &s;he withdrew from the ca&s;ement to a
remote part of the chamber. But &s;he was
not yet beyond the reach of the mu&s;ic;
&s;he heard the mea&s;ure change, and the
&s;ucceeding air called her again to the win|dow,
for &s;he immediately recollected it to
be the &s;ame &s;he had formerly heard in the
fi&s;hing-hou&s;e in Ga&s;cony. A&s;&s;i&s;ted, per|haps;
by the my&s;tery, which had then ac|companied
this &s;train, it had made &s;o deep
an impre&s;&s;ion her memory, that &s;he had
never &s;ince entirely forgotten it; and the
manner, in which it was now &s;ung, con|vinced
her, however unaccountable
the circum&s;tance appeared, that this was the
&s;ame voice &s;he had then heard. Surpri&s;e
&s;oon yielded to other emotions; a thought
darted, like lightning, upon her mind,
which di&s;covered a train of hopes, that re|vived
<PB N="128" REF="130">
all her &s;pirits. Yet the&s;e hopes were
&s;o new, &s;o unexpected, &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing, that
&s;he did not dare to tru&s;t, though &s;he could
not re&s;olve to di&s;courage them. She &s;at
down by the ca&s;ement, breathle&s;s, and
overcome with the alternate emotions of
hope and fear; then ro&s;e again, leaned
from the window, that &s;he might catch a
nearer &s;ound, li&s;tened, now doubting and
then believing, &s;oftly exclaimed the name
of Valancourt, and then &s;unk again into
the chair. Yes, it was po&s;&s;ible, that Va|lancourt
was near her, and &s;he recollected
circum&s;tances, which induced her to be|lieve
it was his voice &s;he had ju&s;t heard.
She remembered he had more than once
&s;aid that the fi&s;hing-hou&s;e, where &s;he had
formerly li&s;tened to this voice and air, and
where &s;he had &s;een pencilled &s;onnets, ad|dre&s;&s;ed
to her&s;elf, had been his favourite
haunt, before he had been made known to
her; there, too, &s;he had her&s;elf unexpect|edly
met him. It appeared, from the&s;e
circum&s;tances, more than probable, that he
<PB N="129" REF="131">
was the mu&s;ician, who had formerly charm|ed
her attention, and the author of the
lines, which had expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch tender ad|miration;
&mdash;who el&s;e, indeed, could it be?
She was unable, at that $ime, to $orm a
conjecture, as to the writer, but, &s;ince her
acquaintance with Valancourt, whenever
he had mentioned the. fi&s;hing-hou&s;e to
have been known to him, &s;he had not
&s;crupled to believe that he was the author
of the &s;onnets.</P>
<P>As the&s;e con&s;iderations pa&s;&s;ed over her
mind, joy, fear and tenderne&s;s contended
at her heart; &s;he leaned again from the
ca&s;ement to, catch the &s;ounds, which might
confirm, or de&s;troy her hope, though &s;he
did not recollect to have ever heard him
&s;ing; but the voice, and the. in&s;trument,
now cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>She con&s;idered for a moment whether &s;he
&s;hould venture to &s;peak: then, not choo&s;|ing,
le&s;t it &s;hould&punc; be he, to mention his
name, and yet too rnuch intere&s;ted to ne|glect
the opportunity of enquiring, &s;he
<PB N="130" REF="132">
called from the ca&s;ement, &startq;Is that &s;ong
from Ga&s;cony?&endq; Her anxious attention
was not cheered by any reply; every thing
remained &s;ilent. Her impatience increa&s;|ing
with her fears, &s;he repeated the que&s;|tion;
but &s;till no &s;ound was heard, except
the $ighings of the wind among the battle|ments
above; and &s;he endeavoured to con|&s;ole
her&s;elf with a belief, that the &s;tranger,
whoever he, was&punc; had retired, before &s;he
had &s;pokcn, beyond the reach of her
voice, which, it appeared certain, had
Valancourt heard and recognized, he
would in&s;tantly have replied to. Pre&s;ent|ly,
however, &s;he con&s;idered, hat a-motive
of prudence, and not an accidental remo|val,
might occa&s;ion his &s;ilence; but the
&s;urmi&s;e, that led to this reflection, &s;ud|denly
changed her hope and joy to terror
and grief; for, if Valancourt were in the
ca&s;tle, it was too probable, that he was
here a pri&s;oner, taken with &s;ome of his
countrymen, many of whom were at that
time engaged in the wars of Italy, or in|tercepted
<PB N="131" REF="133">
in &s;ame attempt to reach her.
Had he even recollected Emily's voice,
he would have feared, in the&s;e circum|&s;tances,
to reply to it, in the pre&s;ence of
the men, who guarded his pri&s;on.</P>
<P>What &s;o lately &s;he had eagerly hoped
&s;he now believed &s;he dreaded;&mdash;dreaded
to know, that Valancourt was near her;
and, while &s;he was anxious to be relieved
from her apprehen&s;ion for his &s;afety, &s;he
&s;till was uncon&s;cious, that a hope of &s;oon
&s;eeing him, &s;truggled with the fear.</P>
<P>She remained li&s;tening at the ca&s;ement,
till the air began to fre&s;hen, and one high
mountain in the ea&s;t to glimmer with the
morning; when, wearied with anxiety,
&s;he retired to her couch, where &s;he found
it utterly impo&s;&s;ible to &s;leep, for joy, ten|derne&s;s,
doubt and apprehen&s;ion, di&s;tract|ed
her during the whole night. Now &s;he
ro&s;e from the couch, and opened the ca&s;e|ment
to li&s;ten; then &s;he would pace the
room with impatient &s;teps, and, at length,
return with de&s;pondence to her pillow.
<PB N="132" REF="134">
Never did hours appear to move &s;o hea|vily,
as tho&s;e of this anxious night; after;
which &s;he hoped that Annette might ap|pear,
and conclude her pre&s;ent &s;tate of torturing &s;u&s;pen&s;e.</P>

&startq;Aye, I &s;aid &s;o, I told him &s;o; but it

<P>&startq;Locked you&punc; up!&endq; &s;aid Emily, with
di&s;plea&s;ure, &startq;Why do you permit Lu|dovico

<P>&startq;Holy Saints!&endq; exclaimed Annette,
&startq;how can I help it! If he will lock the

how am I to get out,, unle&s;s I jump through

<P>&startq;What, were they di&s;puting, then?&endq;

<P>&startq;No, ma'am&s;elle, not fighting, but al|mo&s;t
<PB N="135" REF="137">
as good, for I believe there was not
one of the Signors &s;ober; and what is
more, not one of tho&s;e fine ladies &s;ober,

that all tho&s;e fine &s;ilks and fine veils,&mdash;

Annette, what is to become of you, if you

all the&s;e drunken, Signors?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O! &s;ays I, for that matter, I only
want to go to my young lady's chamber,
and I have only to go, you know, along
the vaulted pa&s;&s;age and acro&s;s the great
hall and up the marble &s;lair-cafe and along
the north gallery and through the we&s;t
wing of the ca&s;tle, and I am in the corri|dor

&s;carcely recovered of one wound, &s;hall I
put my&s;elf in the way of getting another?
for if any of the cavaliers meet you, they

<P>&startq;Yes, he did indeed, ma'am&s;elle, not|with&s;tanding
all I could &s;ay to the contrary;
and Catarina and I and he &s;taid there all

not &s;o vexed, for there came Signer. Ve|rezzi
<PB N="137" REF="139">
roaring along the pa&s;&s;age, like a
mad bull, and he mi&s;took Ludovico's hall,
for old Carlo's; &s;o he tried to bur&s;t open
the door, and called out for more wine,
for that he had drunk all the fla&s;ks dry,
and was dying of thir&s;t. So we were all
as &s;till as night, that he might &s;uppo&s;e
there was nobody in the room; but the
Signor was as cunning as the be&s;t of us,
and kept calling out at the door, &startq;Come
&s;orth, my antient hero!&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;here
is no enemy at the gate, that you need
hide your&s;elf&punc; come forth, my valorous

opened his door, and he came with a fla&s;k
in his hand; for, as &s;oon as the Signor &s;aw
him, he was as $ame as could be, and fol|lowed
him away as naturally as a dog does
a butcher, with, a piece of meat in his ba&s;|ket.
All this I &s;aw through the key-hole.
Well, Annette, &s;aid Ludovico, jeeringly,
&s;hall I let you out now? O no, &s;ays I,
I would not&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;I have &s;ome que&s;tions to a&s;k you on

<P>&startq;I was not in the way, ma'am&s;elle, re|plied
Annette &startq;when the fir&s;t party came
in from the mountains, and the la&s;t party
is not come back yet, &s;o I don't know,
whether there are any pri&s;oners; but it is
expected back to-night, or to-morrow,
and I &s;hall know then, Perhaps</P>
<P>Emily enquired if &s;he had ever heard
the &s;ervants talk of pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>&startq;Ah ma'am&s;elle!&endq; &s;aid Annette archly,
&startq;now I dare &s;ay you are thinking of
Mon&s;ieur Valancourt, and that he may
have come among the armies, which, they
&s;ay, are come from our country, to fight
again&s;t this &s;tate, and that he has met with
&s;ome of <HI>cur</HI> people, and is taken captive.
O Lord! how glad I &s;hould be, if it was &s;o!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Woul'd you, indeed, be glad?&endq; &s;aid
Emily, in a tone of mournful reproach.</P>
<P>&startq;To be &s;ure I &s;hould, ma'am,&endq; replied
<PB N="139" REF="141">
Annette,&endq; and would not you be glad too,
to &s;ee Signor Valancourt? I don't know
any chevalier I like better, I have a very
great regard for the Signor, truly.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Your regard for him cannot be doubt|ed&endq;
&s;aid Emily, &startq;&s;ince you wi&s;h to &s;ee
him a pri&s;oner.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why no, ma'am&s;elle, not a pri&s;oner
either; but one mu&s;t be glad to &s;ee him,
you know. And it was only the other
night I dreamt&mdash;I dreamt I &s;aw him drive
into the ca&s;tle-yard all in a coach and &s;ix,
and dre&s;&s;ed out, with a laced coat and a
&s;word, like a lord as he is.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily could not forbear &s;miling at An|nette's
ideas of &startq;Valancourt, and repeated
her enquiry, whether &s;he had heard the
&s;ervants talk of pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>&startq;No, ma'am&s;elle,&endq; replied &s;he,&startq;never;
and lately they have done nothing but
talk of the apparition, that has been walk|ing
about of a night on the ramparts, and
that frightened the&punc;&s;entinels into fits. It
came among them like a fla&s;h of fire, they
<PB N="140" REF="142">
&s;ay, and they all fell down in a row, till
they came to them&s;elves again; and then
it was gone, and nothing to be &s;een but
the old ca&s;tle walls; &s;o they helped one
another up again as fa&s;t as they could.
You would not believe, ma'am&s;elle, though
I &s;hewed you the very cannon, where it
u&s;ed to appear.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And are you, indeed, &s;o &s;imple, An|nette,&endq;
&s;aid Emily, &s;miling-at this curious
exaggeration of the circum&s;tance &s;he had
witne&s;&s;ed, &startq;as to credit the&s;e &s;tories?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Credit them, ma'am&s;elle! why all the
world could not per&s;uade me out of them.
Roberto and Seba&s;tian and half a dozen
more of them went into fits! To be &s;ure,
there was no occa&s;ion for that; I &s;aid, my|&s;elf,
there was no need of that, for, &s;ays
I, when the enemy comes, what a pretty
figure they will cut, if they are to fall
down in fits, all of a row! The enemy won't
be &s;o civil, perhaps, as to walk off, like
the gho&s;t, and leave them to help one
another up, but will fall to, cutting and
<PB N="141" REF="143">
&s;la&s;hing, till he makes them all ri&s;e up
dead men. No, no, &s;ays I, there is rea&s;on
in all things: though I might have fallen
down in a fit, that was no rule for them,
being, becau&s;e it is no bu&s;ine&s;s of mine
to look gruff and fight battles.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily endeavoured to correct the &s;u|per&s;titious
weakne&s;s of Annette, though
&s;he could not entirely &s;ubdue her own;
to which the latter only replied, &startq;Nay,
ma'am&s;elle, you will believe nothing; you
are almo&s;t as bad as the Signor him&s;elf,
who was in a great pa&s;&s;ion when they told
him of what had happened, and &s;wore
that the fir&s;t man, who repeated &s;uch non|&s;en&s;e,
&s;ould be thrown into the dungeon
under the ea&s;t turret. This was a hard
puni&s;hment too, for only talking non|&s;en&s;e,
as he called it, but I dare &s;ay he
had other rea&s;ons for calling it &s;o, than
you have, ma'am&endq;</P>
<P>Emily looked di&s;plea&s;ed, and made no
reply. As &s;he mu&s;ed upon the recollected
appearance, which had lately &s;o much
<PB N="142" REF="144">
alarmed her, and con&s;idered the circum|&s;tances
of the figure having &s;tationed it&s;elf
oppo&s;ite to her ca&s;ement, &s;he was for a
moment inclined to believe it was Valan|court,
whom &s;he had &s;een. Yet, if it was
he, why did&punc; he not &s;peak to her, when he
had. the, opportunity of doing &s;o&mdash;and, if
he was a pri&s;oner in the ca&s;tle, and he
could be here in no other character, how
could he obtain the means of walking
abroad on the rampart? Thus &s;he was
utterly unabtle to decide&punc; whether the
mu&s;ician and the form &s;he had ob&s;erved,
were the &s;ame, or, if they were whether
this was Valancourt. She, however, de|&s;ired,
that Annette would endeavour to
learn whether any pri&s;oners were in the
ca&s;tle, and al&s;o, their names.</P>
<P>&startq;O dear, ma'am&s;elle!&endq; &s;aid Annette,
&startq;I forget to tell you what you bade mea&s;k
about, the ladies, as they call them&s;elves,
who are lately come to Udolpho. Why
that Signora Livona, that the Signor
brought to &s;ee my late lady at Venice, is
<PB N="143" REF="145">
his mi&s;tre&s;s now, and was little better
then, I dare &s;ay. And Ludovico &s;ays
(but pray be &s;ecret, ma'am) that his <HI>Ex|cellenza</HI>
introduced her only to impo&s;e
upon the world, that had begun to make
free with her character. So when people
&s;aw my! lady notice her, they thought what
they had heard mu&s;t be &s;candal. The
other two are the mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of Signor Ve|rezzi
and Signor Bertolini; and Signor
Montoni invited them all to the ca&s;tle;
and &s;o, ye&s;terday, he gave a great enter|tainment;
and there they were, all drinking
Tu&s;cany wine and all &s;orts, and laughing
and &s;inging, till they made the ca&s;tle ring
again. But I thought they were di&s;mal
&s;ounds, &s;o &s;oon after my poor lady's death
too; and they, brought to my mind what
&s;he would have thought, if &s;he had heard
them&mdash;but &s;he cannot hear them now,
poor &s;oul! &s;aid I.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily turned away to conceal her emo|tion,
and then de&s;ired Annette to&punc; go, and
make enquiry, concerning the pri&s;oners,
<PB N="144" REF="146">
that might be in the ca&s;tle, but conjured
her to do it with caution, and on no ac|count
to mention her name, or that of
Mon&s;ieur Valancourt.</P>
<P>&startq;Now I think of it, ma'am&s;elle,&endq; &s;aid
Annette, &startq;I do believe there are pri&s;on|ers,
for I overheard one of the Signor's
men, ye&s;terday, in the &s;ervants hall, talk|ing
&s;omething about ran&s;oms,&punc; and &s;aying
what a fine thing it was for his <HI>sExcellenza</HI>
to catch up men, and they were as good
booty as any other, becau&s;e of the ran&s;oms.
And the other man was grumbling, and
&s;aying it was fine enough for the Signor,
but none &s;o fine for his &s;oldiers, becau&s;e,
&s;aid he, we don't go &s;hares there.&endq;</P>
<P>This information heightened&punc; Emily's
impatience to know more, and Annette
immediately departed on her enquiry.</P>
<P>The late re&s;olution of Emily to re&s;ign
her e&s;tates to Montoni, now gave way to
new con&s;iderations; the po&s;&s;ibility, that
Valancourt was near her, revived her for|titude
and &s;he determined to brave the
<PB N="145" REF="147">
threatened vengeance, at lea&s;t, till &s;he
could be a&s;&s;ured whether he was really in
the ca&s;tle. She was in this temper of
mind, when t&s;e received a me&s;&s;age from
Montoni, requiring her attendance in the
cedar parlour, which &s;he obeyed with
trembling, and, on 'her way thi$her, en|deavoured
to animate her fortitude with
the idea of Valancourt.</P>
<P>Montoni was alone. &startq;I &s;ent for you,&endq;
&s;aid he, &startq;to give you another opportunity
of retracting your late mi&s;taken-a&s;&s;ertions
concerning the Languedoc e&s;tates. I will
conde&s;cend to advi&s;e, where I may com|mand.
&mdash;If you are really deluded by an
opinion, that you have any $ight to the&s;e
e&s;tates, at lea&s;t, do not per&s;i&s;t in the error
&mdash;an error, which you may perceive, too
late, has been fatal to you. Dare my re|&s;entment
$o further, but &s;ign the papers.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If I have no right in the&s;e e&s;tates, &s;ir,&endq;
&s;aid Emily, &startq;of what &s;ervice can it be to
you, that I &s;hould &s;ign any papers, con|cerning
them? If the lands are yours by
<PB N="146" REF="148">
law, you certainly may po&s;&s;e&s;s them, with|out
my interference, or my con&s;ent.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I will have no more argument,&endq; &s;aid
Montoni, with a look that made her trem|ble.
&startq;What had I but trouble to expect,
when I conde&s;cended to rea&s;on with a baby!
But I will be trifled with no longer: let
the&punc; recollection of your aunt's &s;ufferings,
in con&s;equence of her folly and ob&s;tinacy,
teach you a le&s;&s;on.&mdash;Sign the papers.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily's re&s;olution was for a moment
awed:&mdash;&s;he &s;hrunk at the recollections he
revived, and from the vengeance he threat|ened;
but then, the image of Valancourt,
who &s;o long had loved her, and who was
now,&punc; perhaps, &s;o near her, came to her
heart, and, together with the &s;trong feelings
of indignation, with which &s;he had always,
from her infancy, regarded an act of in|ju&s;tice,
in&s;pired her with a noble, though
imprudent, courage.</P>
<P>&startq;Sign the papers,&endq; &s;aid Montoni,
more impatiently than before.</P>
<P>&startq;Never, &s;ir,&endq; replied Emily; &startq;that re|que&s;t
<PB N="147" REF="149">
would have proved to me the in|ju&s;tice of your claim,
had I even been ig|norant
of my right.&endq;</P>
<P>Montoni turned pale with anger,
while his quivering lip and lurking eye
made her almo&s;t repent the boldne&s;s of her
&s;peech.</P>
<P>&startq;Then all my vengeance falls upon you,&endq;
he exclaimed, with an horrible oath. &startq;And
think not it &s;hall be delayed. Neither the
e&s;tates in Languedoc, or Ga&s;cony, &s;hall be
yours; you have dared to que&s;tion my
right,&mdash;now dare to que&s;tion my power.
I have a puni&s;hment which you think not
of; it is terrible! This night&mdash;this very
night&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;This night!&endq; repeated another voice.</P>
<P>Montoni pau&s;ed, and turned half round,
but, &s;eeming to recollect him&s;elf, he pro|ceeded
in a lower tone.</P>
<P>&startq;You have lately &s;een one terrible ex|ample
of ob&s;tinacy and folly; yet this, it appears,
has not been &s;ufficient to deter
<PB N="148" REF="150">
you.&mdash;I could tell you of others&mdash;I could
make you tremble at the bare recital.&endq;</P>
<P>He was interrupted by a groan, which
&s;eemed to ri&s;e from underneath the cham|ber
they were in; and, as he threw a glance
round it, impatience and rage &s;la&s;hed from
his eyes, yet &s;omething like a &s;hade of fear
pa&s;&s;ed over his countenance. Emily &s;at
down in a chair, near the door, for the va|rious
emotions &s;he had &s;uffered, now almo&s;t
overcame her; but Montoni pau&s;ed
&s;carcely an in&s;tant, and, commanding his
features, re&s;umed his di&s;cour&s;e in a lower,
yet &s;terner voice.</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;ay, I could give you other in&s;tances
of my power and of my character, which
it &s;eems you do not under&s;tand, or you
would not defy me.&mdash;I could tell you,
that, when once my re&s;olution is taken&mdash;
but I am talking to a baby. Let me, how|ever,
repeat, that terrible as are the exam|ples
I could recite, the recital could not now
benefit you; for, though, your re|pentance
<PB N="149" REF="151">
pentance would put an immediate end to
oppo&s;ition, it would not now appea&s;e my
indignation.&mdash;I will have vengeance as well
as ju&s;tice.&endq;</P>
<P>Another groan filled the pau&s;e which
Montoni made.</P>
<P>&startq;Leave the room in&s;tantly!&endq; &s;aid he,
&s;eeming not to notice this &s;trange occur|rence.
Without power to implore his
pity, &s;he ro&s;e to go, but found that &s;he
could not &s;upport her&s;elf; awe and terror
overcame her, and &s;he &s;unk again into
the chair.</P>
<P>&startq;Quit my pre&s;ence!&endq; cried Montoni,
&startq;This affectation of fear ill becomes the
heroine who has ju&s;t dared to brave my in|dignation.</P>
<P>&startq;Did you hear nothing, Signor?&endq; &s;aid
Emily, trembling, and &s;till unable to leave
the room.</P>
<P>&startq;I heard my own voice,&endq; rejoined
Montoni, &s;ternly.</P>
<P>&startq;And nothing el&s;e?&endq; &s;aid Emily,
<PB N="150" REF="152">
&s;peaking with difficulty.&mdash;&startq;There again!
Do you hear nothing now?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Obey my order,&endq; repeated Montoni.
&startq;And for the&s;e fool's tricks&mdash;I will &s;oon
di&s;cover by whom they are practi&s;ed.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily again ro&s;e, and exerted her&s;elf to
the utmo&s;t to leave the room, while Mon|toni
followed her; but, in&s;tead of calling
aloud to his &s;ervants to &s;earch the chamber,
as he had formerly done on a &s;imilar oc|currence,
pa&s;ted to the ramparts.</P>
<P>As, in her way to the corridor, &s;he re&s;ted
for a moment at an open ca&s;ement,
Emily &s;aw a party of Montoni's troops
winding down a di&s;tant mountain, whom
&s;he noticed no further, than as they brought
to her mind the wretched pri&s;oners they
were, perhaps, bringing to the ca&s;tle. At
length, having reached her apartment, &s;he
threw her&s;elf upon the couch, overcome
with rhe new horrors of her &s;ituation. Her
thoughts lo&s;t in tumult and perplexity,
&s;he could neither repent of, or approve, her
<PB N="151" REF="153">
late conduct; &s;he could only remember,
that &s;he was in the power of a man, who
had no principle of action&mdash;but his will;
and the a&s;toni&s;hment and terrors of &s;uper|&s;tition,
which had, for a moment, &s;o &s;trongly
af&s;ailed her, now yielded to tho&s;e of
rea&s;on.</P>
<P>She was, at length, rou&s;ed from the re|verie,
which engaged her, by a confu&s;ion of
di&s;tant voices, and a clattering of hoofs,
that &s;eemed to come, on the wind, from the
courts. A &s;udden hope, that &s;ome good,
was approaching, &s;eized her mind, till &s;he
remembered the troops &s;he had ob&s;erved
from, the ca&s;ement, and concluded this to
be the party, which Annette had &s;aid were
expected at Udolpho.</P>
<P>Soon after, &s;he heard voices faintly from
the halls, and the noife of hor&s;es' feet &s;unk
away in the wind; &s;ilence en&s;ued. Emily
li&s;tened anxiou&s;ly for Annette's &s;tep in the
corridor, but a pau&s;e of total &s;tillne&s;s conti|nued,
till again the ca&s;tle &s;eemed to be all
tumult and confu&s;ion. She heard the echoes
<PB N="152" REF="154">
of many foot&s;teps, pa&s;&s;ing to and fro in the
halls and avenues below, and then bu&s;y
tongues were loud on the rampart. Hav|ing
hurried to her ca&s;ement, &s;he perceived
Montoni, with &s;ome of his officers, leaning
on the walls, and pointing from them;
while &s;everal &s;oldiers were employed at
the further end of the rampart about &s;ome
cannon; and &s;he continued to ob&s;erve
them, carele&s;s of the pa&s;&s;ing time.</P>
<P>Annette at length appeared, but brought
no intelligence of Valancourt, &startq;For, ma'am|&s;elle,&endq;
&s;aid &s;he,&startq;all the people pretend to
know nothing about any pri&s;oners. But
here is a fine piece of bu&s;ine&s;s! The re&s;t
of the party are ju&s;t arrived, ma'am; they
came &s;campering in as if they would have
broken their necks; one &s;carcely knew
whether the man, or his hor&s;e would get
within the gates fir&s;t. And they have
brought word&mdash;and &s;uch news! they have
brought word, that a party of the enemy,
as they call them, are coming towards the
ca&s;tle; &s;o we &s;hall have all the officers of,
<PB N="153" REF="155">
ju&s;tice, I &s;uppo&s;e, be&s;ieging it! all tho&s;e
terrible-looking fellows one u&s;ed to &s;ee at
Venice.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Thank God! exclaimed Emily, fer|vently,
&startq;there is yet a hope left for me,
then!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What mean you ma'am&s;elle? Do
you wi&s;h to fall into the hands of tho&s;e
&s;ad-looking men! Why I u&s;ed to &s;hudder
as I pa&s;&s;ed them, and &s;hould have gue&s;&s;ed
what they were, if Ludovico had not told
me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;We cannot be in wor&s;e hands than at
pre&s;ent,&endq; replied Emily, unguardedly;
&startq;but what rea&s;on have you to &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e
are officers of ju&s;tice?&endq;</P>
<P>Why <HI>our</HI> people, ma'am, are all in
&s;uch a fright, and a fu&s;s; and I don't know
any thing but the fear of ju&s;tice, that could
make them &s;o. I u&s;ed to think nothing on
earth could flu&s;ter them, unle&s;s, indeed, it
was a gho&s;t, or &s;o; but now, &s;ome of them
are for hiding down in the vaults under the
ca&s;tle; but you mu&s;t not tell the Signor
<PB N="154" REF="156">
this, ma'am&s;elle, and I overheard two of
them talking&mdash;Holy Mother! what
makes you look &s;o &s;ad, ma'am&s;elle? You
don't hear what I &s;ay!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, I do, Annette; pray proceed.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, ma'am&s;elle, all the ca&s;tle is in
&s;uch hurly-burly. Some of the men are
loading the cannon, and &s;ome are examin|ing
the great gates, and the walls all round,
and are hammering and patching up, ju&s;t
as if all tho&s;e repairs had never been made,
that were &s;o long about. But what is to
become of me and you, ma'am&s;elle, and
Ludovico? O! when I hear the &s;ound of
the cannon, I &s;hall die with fright. If I
could but catch the great. gate open for one
minute, I would be even with it for &s;hut|ting
me within the&s;e walls &s;o long!&mdash;it
&s;hould never &s;ee me again.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily caught the latter words of An|nette.
&endq;O! if you could find it open,
but for one moment!&endq; &s;he exclaimed&endq; my
peace might yet. be &s;aved!&endq; The heavy
groan &s;he uttered, and the wildne&s;s of her
<PB N="155" REF="157">
look, terrified Annette, &s;till more than her
words; who entreated Emily to explain
the meaning of them, to whom it &s;uddenly
occurred, that Ludovico might be of &s;ome
&s;ervice, if there &s;hould be a po&s;&s;ibility of
e&s;cape, and who repeated the &s;ub&s;tance of
what had pa&s;&s;ed between Montoni and
her&s;elf, but conjured her to mention this
to no per&s;on. except to Ludovico.&endq; It
may, perhaps, be in his power,&endq; &s;he added,
&endq;to effect our e&s;cape. Go to him, An|nette,
tell him what I have to apprehend,
and what I have already &s;uffered; but en|treat
him to be &s;ecret, and to lo&s;e no time
in attempting to relea&s;e us. If he is wil|ling
to undertake this he &s;hall be amply
rewarded. I cannot &s;peak with him my|&s;elf,
for we might be ob&s;erved and then
effectual care would be taken to prevent
our flight. But be quick, Annette, and,
above all, be di&s;creet&mdash;I will await your
return in this apartment.&endq;</P>
<P>The girl, who&s;e hone&s;t heart had been
much aflfected by the recital, was now as
<PB N="156" REF="158">
eager to obey, as Emily was to employ
her, and &s;he immediately quitted the
room.</P>
<P>Emily's &s;urpri&s;e increa&s;ed, as &s;he reflected
upon Annette's intelligence.&endq;Alas!&endq;
&s;aid &s;he,&endq; what can the officers of ju&s;tice
do again&s;t an armed ca&s;tle? the&s;e cannot
be &s;uch&endq; Upon further con&s;ideration,
however, &s;he concluded, that, Montoni's
bands having plundered the country round,
the inhabitants had taken arms, and were
coming with the officers of police and a
party of &s;oldiers, to force their way into
the ca&s;tle.&endq; But they know not,&endq; thought
&s;he,&endq; its &s;trength, or the armed numbers
within it. Alas! except from flight, I
have nothing to hope!&endq;</P>
<P>Montoni, though not preci&s;ely what
Emily apprehended him to be&mdash;a captain
of banditti&mdash;had employed his troops in
enterpri&s;es not le&s;s daring, or le&s;s atrocious,
than &s;uch a character would have under|taken.
They had not only pillaged, when|ever
opportunity offered, the helple&s;s
<PB N="157" REF="159">
traveller, but had attacked, and plundered
the villas of &s;everal per&s;ons, which, being
&s;ituated among the &s;olitary rece&s;&s;es of the
mountains, were totally unprepared for re-&s;i&s;tance.
In the&s;e expeditions the com|manders
of the party did not appear, and
the men, partly di&s;gui&s;ed, had &s;ometimes
been mi&s;taken for common robbers, and,
at others, for bands of the foreign enemy,
who, at that period, invaded the country.
But, though they had already pillaged &s;eve|ral
man&s;ions, and brought home con&s;ider|able
trea&s;ures, they had ventured to ap|proach
only one ca&s;tle, in the attack of
which they were a&s;&s;i&s;ted by other troops of
their own order; from this however, they
were vigorou&s;ly repul&s;ed, and pur&s;ued by
&s;ome of the foreign enemy, who were in
league with the be&s;ieged. Montoni's troops
fled precipitately towards Udolpho, but were
&s;o clo&s;ely tracked aver the mountains, that,
when they reached one of the heights: in
the neighbourhood of. the ca&s;tle, and
looked back upon the road, they perceived
<PB N="158" REF="160">
the enemy winding among the cliffs be|low,
and at not more than a league di&s;tant.
Upon this di&s;covery, they ha&s;tened forward
with increa&s;ed &s;peed, to prepare Montoni
for the enemy; and it was their arrival,
which had thrown the ca&s;tle into &s;uch con|fu&s;ion
and tumult.</P>
<P>As Emily awaited anxiou&s;ly &s;ome in|formation
from below, &s;he now &s;aw from her
ca&s;ements a body of troops pour over the
neighbouring heights; and, though. An|nette
had been gone a very &s;hort time, and
had a difficult and dangerous bu&s;ine&s;s to
accompli&s;h, her impatience for intelligence
became painful: &s;he li&s;tened; opened
her door; and often went out upon the
corridor to meet her.</P>
<P>At length, &s;he heard a foot&s;tep approach
her chamber; and, on opening the door,
&s;aw, not Annette but old Carlo! New
fears ru&s;heod upon her mind. He &s;aid he
came from the Signor, who had ordered
him to inform her, that me mu&s;t be ready
to depart from Udolpho immediately, for
<PB N="159" REF="161">
that the ca&s;tle was about to be be&s;ieged;
and that mules were preparing to convey
her, with her guides, to a place of &s;afety.</P>
<P>&endq;Of &s;afety!&endq; exclaimed Emily, thought|le&s;sly;
has, then, the Signor &s;o much
con&s;ideration for me?&endq;</P>
<P>Carlo looked upon the ground, and
made no reply. A thou&s;and oppo&s;ite emo|tions
agitated Emily, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, as &s;he
li&s;tened to old Carlo; tho&s;e of joy, grief,
di&s;tru&s;t and apprehen&s;ion, appeared, and
vani&s;hed from her mind, with the quick|ne&s;s
of lightning. One moment, it &s;eemed
impo&s;&s;ible, that Montoni could take this
mea&s;ure merely for her pre&s;ervation; and
&s;o very &s;trange was his &s;ending her from
the ca&s;tle at all, that &s;he could attribute
it only to the de&s;ign of carrying into exe|cution
the new &s;cherne of vengeance, with
which he had menaced her. In the next
in&s;tant, it appeared &s;o de&s;irable to quit the
ca&s;tle, under any circum&s;tances, that &s;he
could not but rejoice in the pro&s;pect, be|lieving
that change mu&s;t be for the better,
<PB N="160" REF="162">
till &s;he remembered the probability of Va|lancourt
being detained in it, when &s;orrow
and regret u&s;urped hermind, and &s;he wi&s;h|ed,
much more fervently than &s;he had yet
done, that it might not be his voice which
&s;he had heard.</P>
<P>Carlo having reminded her, that &s;he had
no time to lo&s;e, for that the enemy were
within &s;ight of the ca&s;tle, Emily entreated
him to inform her whither &s;he was to go; and,
after &s;ome he&s;itation, he &s;aid he had re|ceived
no orders to tell; but, on her repeat|ing
the que&s;tion, replied, that he believed
&s;he was to be carried into Tu&s;cany.</P>
<P>&endq;To Tu&s;cany!&endq; exclaimed Emily&mdash;
&endq;and why thither?&endq;</P>
<P>Carlo an&s;wered, that he knew nothing
further, than that &s;he was to be lodged in
a cottage on the. borders of Tu&s;cany, at
the feet of the Apennines&mdash;&endq;Not a day's
journey di&s;tant,&endq;' &s;aid he.</P>
<P>Emily now di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him; add, with
trembling hands, prepared the &s;mall pack|age,
that &s;he meant to take with her; while
<PB N="161" REF="163">
&s;he was employed about which Annette
returned.</P>
<P>&endq;O ma'am&s;elle!&endq;&s;aid &s;he,&endq; nothing can
be done! Ludovico &s;ays the new porter
is more watchful even than Barnardine
was, and we might as well throw our&s;elves
in the way of a dragon, as in his. Ludo|vico
is almo&s;t as broken-hearted as you
are, ma'am, on my account, he &s;ays, and
I am &s;ure I &s;hall never live to hear the
cannon fire twice!&endq;</P>
<P>She now began to weep, but revived,
upon hearing of what had ju&s;t occurred,
and entreated Emily to take her with her</P>
<P>&endq;That I will do mo&s;t willingly,&endq; replied
Emily,&endq; if Signor Montoni permits it;&endq;
to which Annette made no reply, but ran
out of the room, and immediately &s;ought
Montoni, who was on the terrace, &s;urrounded
by his officers, where &s;he began her peti|tion.
He &s;harply bade her go into the
ca&s;tle, and ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed her reque&s;t.
Annette, However, not only pleaded for
her&s;elf, but;for Ludovico; and Montoni
<PB N="162" REF="164">
had ordered &s;ome of his men to take her
from his pre&s;ence, before &s;he would retire.</P>
<P>In an agony of di&s;appointment,&s;he re|turned
to Emily, who foreboded little good
towards her&s;elf, from this refu&s;al to An|nette,
and who, &s;oon after, received a &s;um|mons
to repair to the great court, where
the mules, with her guides, were in wait|ing.
Emily here tried in vain to &s;ooth
the weeping Annette, who per&s;i&s;ted in
&s;aying, that &s;hc &s;hould never &s;ee her dear
young lady again; a fear, which. her mi&s;|tre&s;s
&s;ecretly thought too well ju&s;tified, but
which &s;he endeavoured to re&s;train, while,
with apparent compo&s;ure, &s;he bade this
affectionate &s;ervant farewell. Annette,
however, followed to the courts, which
were now thronged with people, bu&s;y in
preparation for the enemy; and, having
&s;een her mount her mule and depart, with
her attendants, through the portal, turned
into the ca&s;tle and wept again.</P>
<P>Emily, meanwhile, as &s;he looked back
upon the gloomy courts of the ca&s;tle, no
<PB N="163" REF="165">
longer &s;ilent as when &s;he had fir&s;t entered
them, but re&s;ounding with the noi&s;e of
preparation for their defence, as well as
crowded with &s;oldiers and workmen, hur|rying
to and fro; and, when &s;he pa&s;&s;ed
once more under the huge portcullis,
which had formerly &s;truck her with terror
and di&s;may; and, looking round, &s;aw no
walls to confine her &s;teps&mdash;felt, in &s;pite of
anticipation, the &s;udden joy of a pri&s;oner,
who unexpectedly finds him&s;elf at liberty.
This emotion would not &s;uffer. her now to
look impartially on the dangers that await|ed
her without; on mountains infe&s;ted by
ho&s;tile parties, who &s;eized every opportu|nity
for plunder; and on a journey com|menced
under the guidance of men, who&s;e
countenances certainly did not &s;peak fa|vourably
of their di&s;po&s;itions. In the pre|&s;ent
moments, &s;he could only rejoice, that
&s;he was liberated from tho&s;e walls, which,
&s;he had entered with &s;uch di&s;mal forebod|ings;
and, remembering the &s;uper&s;titious
pre&s;entiment, which had then &s;eized her,
<PB N="164" REF="166">
&s;he could now &s;mile at the impre&s;&s;ion it
had made upon her mind.</P>
<P>As &s;he gazed, with the&s;e emotions, up|on
the turrets of the ca&s;tle, ri&s;ing high over
the woods, among which &s;he wound, the
&s;tranger, whom &s;he believed to be con|fined
there, returned to her remembrance,
and anxiety and apprehen&s;ion, left he
&s;hould be Valancourt, again pa&s;&s;ed like a
cloud upon her joy. She recollected eve|ry
circum&s;tance, concerning this unknown
per&s;on, &s;ince the night, when &s;he had fir&s;t
heard him play the &s;ong of her native pro|vince;
&mdash;circum&s;tances, which &s;he, had &s;o
often recollected, and compared before,
without extracting from them any thing
like conviction, and which &s;till only
prompted her to believe, that Valancourt
was a pri&s;oner at Udolpho. It was po&s;&s;i|ble,
however, that the men, who were
her conductors, might afford her infor|mation,
on this &s;ubject; but, fearing $to
que&s;tion them immediately, left they &s;hould
be unwilling to di&s;cover any circum&s;tance
<PB N="165" REF="167">
to her in the pre&s;ence of each other, &s;he
watched for an opportunity of &s;peaking
with them &s;eparately.</P>
<P>Soon after, a trumpet echoed faintly
from a di&s;tance; the guides &s;topped, and
looked toward the quarter whence it came,
but the thick woods, which &s;urrounded
them, excluding all view of the country
beyond, one of the men rode on to the
point of an eminence, that afforded a
more exten&s;ive pro&s;pect, to ob&s;erve how
near the enemy, who&s;e trumpet he gue&s;&s;ed
this to be, were advanced; the other,
meanwhile, remained with Emily, and to
him &s;he put &s;ome que&s;tions, concerning
the &s;tranger at Udolpho. Ugo, for this
was his name, &s;aid, that there were &s;eve|ral
pri&s;oners in the ca&s;tle, but he neither
recollected their per&s;ons, or the preci&s;e
time of their arrival, and could therefore
give her no information. There was a
&s;urline&s;s in his manner, as he &s;poke, that
made it probable he would not have &s;ati&s;|fied
<PB N="166" REF="168">
her enquiries, even if he could have
done &s;o.</P>
<P>Having a&s;ked him what pri&s;oners had
been taken, about the time, as nearly as
&s;he could remember, when &s;he had fir&s;t
heard the mu&s;ic,&endq; All that week,&endq; &s;aid
Ugo,&endq; I was out with a party, upon the
mountains, and knew nothing of what was
doing at the ca&s;tle. We had enough up|on
our hands, we had warm work of it.&endq;</P>
<P>Bertrand, the other man, being now
returned, Emily enquired no further, and,
when he had related to his companion
what he had &s;een, they travelled on in
deep &s;ilence; while Emily often caught, be|tween
the opening woods, partial glimp&s;es
of the ca&s;tle above&mdash;the we&s;t towers, who&s;e
battlements were now crowded with archers'
and the ramparts below, where &s;oldiers
were &s;een hurrying along, or bu&s;y upon
the walls, preparing the cannon.</P>
<P>Having emerged from the woods, they
wound along the valley in an oppo&s;ite di|rection
<PB N="167" REF="169">
to that, from whence the enemy
were approaching. Emily had now a full
view of Udolpho, with its gray walls,
towers and terraces, high over-topping the
precipices and the dark woods, and glitter|ing
partially with the arms of the <HI>condot|tieri,</HI>
as the &s;un's rays, &s;treaming through
an autumnal cloud, glanced upon a part
of the edifice, who&s;e remaining features
&s;tood in darkened maje&s;ty. She continued
to gaze, through her tears, upon walls
that, perhaps, con&s;ined Valancourt, and
which now, as the cloud floated away,
were lighted up with &s;udden &s;plendour,
and then, as &s;uddenly were &s;hrouded in
gloom; while the pa&s;&s;ing gleam fell on
the wood-tops below, and heightened the
fir&s;t tints of autumn, that had begun to
&s;teal upon the foliage. The winding
mountains, at length, &s;hut Udolpho from
her view, and &s;he turned, with mournful
reluctance, to other objects. The melan|choly
&s;ighing of the wind among the pines,
that waved high over the &s;teeps, and the
<PB N="168" REF="170">
di&s;tant thunder of a torrent a&s;&s;i&s;ted her
mu&s;ings, and con&s;pired with the wild
&s;cenery around, to diffu&s;e over her mind
emotions &s;olemn, yet not unplea&s;ing, but
which were &s;oon interrupted by the di&s;tant
roar of cannon, echoing among the moun|tains.
The &s;ounds rolled along the wind,
and were repeated in &s;aint and fainter re|verberation,
till they &s;unk in &s;ullen mur|murs.
This was a &s;ignal, that the enemy
had reached the ca&s;tle, and fear for Valan|court
again tormented Emily. She turned
her anxious eyes towards that part of the
country, where the edifice &s;tood, but the
intervening heights concealed it from her
view; &s;till, however, &s;he &s;aw the tall
head of a mountain, which immediately
fronted her late chamber, and on this &s;he
fixed her gaze, as if it could have told her
of all that was pa&s;&s;ing in the &s;cene it over|looked.
the guides twice reminded, her,
that &s;he was lo&s;ing time and that they had
far to go, before &s;he could turn from this
intere&s;ting object, and, even when &s;he
<PB N="169" REF="171">
again moved onward, &s;he often &s;ent a look
back, till only its blue point, brightening
in a gleam of &s;un&s;hine, appeared peeping
over other mountains.</P>
<P>The &s;ound of the cannon affected Ugo,
as the bla&s;t of the trumpet does the war|hore;
it called forth all the fire of his na|ture;
he was impatient to be in the mid&s;t
of the fight, and uttered frequent execra|tions
again&s;t Montoni for having &s;ent him
to a di&s;tance. The feelings of his com|rade
&s;eemed to be very oppo&s;ite, and
adapted rather to the cruelties, than to the
dangers of war.</P>
<P>Emily a&s;ked frequent que&s;tions, con|cerning
the place of her de&s;tination, but
could only learn, that &s;he was going to a
cottage in Tu&s;cany; and, whenever &s;he
mentioned the &s;ubject, &s;he fancied &s;he
perceived, in the countenances of the&s;e
men, an expre&s;&s;ion of malice and cunning,
that alarmed her.</P>
<P>It was afternoon, when they had left the
ca&s;tle. During &s;everal hours, they travel|led
<PB N="170" REF="172">
through regions of profound &s;olitude,
where no bleat of &s;heep, or tark of watch|dog,
broke on &s;ilence, and they were now
too far off to heat even the faint thunder
of the cannon. Towards evening, they
wound down precipices, black with fore&s;ts
of cypre&s;s, pine and cedar, into a glen fo
&s;avage and &s;ecluded, that, if Solitude ever
had local habitation, this might have been
&startq;her place of deare&s;t re&s;idence.&endq; To
Emily it appeared a &s;pot exactly &s;uited
for the retreat of banditti, and, in her ima|gination,
&s;he already &s;aw them lurking un|der
the brow of &s;ome projecting rock
whence their &s;hadows, lengthened by the
&s;etting &s;un, &s;tretched acro&s;s the road, and
warned the traveller of his danger. She
&s;huddered at the idea, and, looking at
her conductors, to ob&s;erve whether they
were armed, thought &s;he &s;aw in them the
banditti &s;he dreaded!</P>
<P>It was in this glen, that they propo&s;ed
to alight, &startq;For,&endq; &s;aid Ugo,&endq; night will
come on pre&s;ently, and then the wolves
<PB N="171" REF="173">
Will make it dangerous to &s;top. This
was a new &s;ubject of alarm to Emily, but
inferior to what &s;he &s;uffered from the
thought of being left in the&s;e wilds, at
midnight, with two &s;uch men as her pre|&s;ent
conductors, Dark and dreadful hints
of what might be Montoni's purpo&s;e in
&s;ending her hither, came to her mind.
She endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade the menfrom
&s;topping, and enquired, with anxiety, how
far they had yet to go.</P>
<P>&startq;Many leagues yet,&endq; replied Bertrand.
&startq;As for you, Signora, you may do as
you plea&s;e about eating, but for us, we
will make a hearty &s;upper, while we can.
We &s;hall have need of it, I warrant, be|fore
we fini&s;h our journey. The &s;un's go|ing
down apace; let us alight under that
rock, yonder.&endq;</P>
<P>His comrade affented, and, turning the
mules out of the road, they advanced to|wards
a cliff, overhung with cedars Emi|ly
following in trembling &s;ilence. They
lifted her from her mule, and, having
<PB N="172" REF="174">
&s;eated them&s;elves on the gra&s;s, at the foot
of the rocks, drew &s;ome homely fare from
a wallet, of which Emily tried to eat a lit|tle,
the better to di&s;gui&s;e her apprehen|&s;ions.</P>
<P>The fun was now &s;unk behind the high
mountains in the we&s;t, upon which a pur|ple
haze began to &s;pread, and the gloom
of twilight to draw over the &s;urrounding
objects. To the low and &s;ullen murmur of
the breeze, pa&s;&s;ing among the woods, &s;he
no longer li&s;tened with any degree of plea|&s;ure,
for it con&s;pired with the wildne&s;s of
the &s;cene and the evening hour, to depre&s;s
her &s;pirits.</P>
<P>Su&s;pen&s;e had &s;o much increa&s;ed her
anxiety, as to the pri&s;oner at Udolpho,
that, finding it impracticable to &s;peak
alone with Bertrand, on that &s;ubject, &s;he
renewed, her que&s;tions in the pre&s;ence of
Ugo; but he either was, or pretended to
be entirely ignorant, concerning the &s;tran|ger.
When he had di&s;m&s;&s;ed the que&s;tion,
he talked with Ugo on &s;ome &s;ubject, which
<PB N="173" REF="175">
led to the mention of Signor Or&s;ino and
of the affair that had bani&s;hed him from
Venice; re&s;pec&s;ting which Emily had ven|tured
to a&s;k. a few que&s;tions. Ugo ap|peared
to be well acquainted, with the
circum&s;tances of that tragical event, and
related &s;ome minute particulars, that both
&s;hocked and &s;urpri&s;ed her, for it appeared
very extraordinary how &s;uch particulars
could be known to any, but to per&s;ons,
pre&s;ent when the affa&s;&s;ination was com|mitted.</P>
<P>&endq;He was of rank,&endq; &s;aid Bertrand,&endq; or
the State would not have troubled it&s;elf to
enquire after his affa&s;&s;ins. The Signor has
been lucky hitherto; this is not the fir&s;t
affair of the kind he has had upon his
hands; and to be &s;ure, when a gentleman
has no other way of getting redre&s;s&mdash;why
he mu&s;t take this.&endq;</P>
<P>&endq;Aye,&endq; &s;aid Ugo,&endq; and why is not
this as good as another? This is the way
to have ju&s;tice done at once, without more
ado. If you go to law, your mu&s;t &s;tay till
<PB N="174" REF="176">
the judges plea&s;e, and may lo&s;e your cau&s;e,
at la&s;t. Why the be&s;t way, then, is to
make &s;ure of your right, while you can,
and execute ju&s;tice your&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>&endq;Yes, yes,&endq; rejoined Bertrand,&endq; if you
wait till ju&s;tice is done you&mdash;you may &s;tay
long enough. Why if I want a friend of
mine properly &s;erved, how am I to get
my revenge? Ten to one they will tell me
he is in the right, and I am in the wrong.
Or, if a fellow has got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of proper|ty,
which I think ought to be mine, why I
may wait, till I &s;tarve, perhaps, before
the law will give it me, and then, after
all, the judge may &s;ay&mdash;the e&s;tate is his.
What is to be done then?&mdash;Why the ca&s;e
is plain enough, I mu&s;t take it at la&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily's horror at this conver&s;ation was
heightened by a &s;u&s;picion, that the latter
part of it was pointed again&s;t her&s;elf, and
that the&s;e men had been commi&s;&s;ioned by
Montoni to execute a &s;imilar kind of <HI>ju&s;|tice,</HI>
in his cau&s;e.</P>
<P>&endq;But I was &s;peaking of Signor Or&s;ino,&endq;
<PB N="175" REF="177">
re&s;umed Bertrand,&endq; he is one of tho&s;e, who
love to do ju&s;tice at once. I remember,
about ten years ago, the Signor had a
quarrel with a cavaliero of Milan. The
&s;tory was told me then, and it is &s;till fre&s;h
in my head. They quarrelled about a
lady, that the Signor liked, and &s;he was
perver&s;e enough to pre&s;er the gentleman,
of Milan, and even carried her whim&s;o
far as to marry him. This provoked the
Signor, as well it might, for he had tried
to talk rea&s;on to her a long while, and u&s;ed
to &s;end people to &s;erenade her, under her
windows, of a night; and u&s;ed to make
ver&s;es about hex and, would &s;wear &s;he was
the hand&s;ome&s;t lady in Milan&mdash;But all
would not do&mdash;nothing would bring her
to rea&s;on; and, as I &s;aid, &s;he went &s;o far
at la&s;t, as to marry this other cavaliero.
This made the Sign&s;r wrath, with a ven|geance;
he re&s;olved to be even with her
though, and he watched his opportunity,
and did not wait long, for, &s;oon after the
marriage, they &s;et out for Padua, nothing
<PB N="176" REF="178">
doubting, I warrant, of what was prepar|ing
for them. The cavaliero thought, to
be &s;ure, he was to be called to no account,
but was to go off triumphant; but he was
&s;oon made to know another &s;ort of &s;tory.&endq;</P>
<P>&endq;What then, the lady had promi&s;ed to
have Signor Or&s;ino.&endq; &s;aid Ugo.</P>
<P>&endq;Promi&s;ed! No,&endq; replied Bertrand,
&endq;&s;he had not wit enough even to tell him
&s;he liked him, as I heard, but the contra|ry,
for &s;he u&s;ed to &s;ay, from the fir&s;t, &s;he
never meant to have him. And this was
what provoked the Signor, &s;o, and with
good rea&s;on, for, who likes to be told that
he is di&s;agreeable? and this was &s;aying as
good. It was enough to tell him this; &s;he
need not have gone, and married another.&endq;</P>
<P>&endq;What, &s;he married, then, on pur|po&s;e
to plague the Signor? &s;aid Ugo.</P>
<P>&endq;I don't know as for that,&endq; replied Ber|trand,
&endq;they &s;aid, indeed, that &s;he had had
a regard for the other gentleman a great
while; but that is nothing to the purpo&s;e,
&s;he &s;hould not have married him, and then
<PB N="177" REF="179">
the Signor would not have been &s;o much
provoked. She might have expected what
was to follow; it was not to be &s;uppo&s;ed
he would bear her ill u&s;age tamely, and
&s;he might thank her&s;elf for what happened.
But, as I &s;aid, they &s;et out for Padua, &s;he
and her hu&s;band, and the road lay over
&s;ome barren mountains like the&s;e. This
suited the Signo$'s purpo&s;e well. He
watched the time of their departure, and
&s;ent his men after them, with directions
what to do. They kept their di&s;tance, till
they &s;aw their opportunity, and this did
not happen, till the &s;econd day's journey,
when, the gentleman having &s;ent his &s;er|vants
forward to the next town, may be,
to have hor&s;es in readine&s;s, the Signor's
men quickened their pace, and overtook
the carriage, in a hollow, between two
mountains, where the woods prevented the
&s;ervants from &s;eeing what pa&s;&s;ed, though
they were then not far off. When we
came up, we fired our trombomi, but
mi&s;&s;ed</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="180">
Emily turned pale, at the&s;e words, and
then hoped &s;he had mi&s;taken them; while
Bertrand proceeded:</P>
<P>&endq;The gentleman fired again, but he
was &s;oon made to alight, and it was as he
turned to call his people, that he was
&s;truck. It was the mo&s;t dexterous feat you
ever &s;aw&mdash;he was &s;truck in the back with
three &s;tillettos at once. He fell, and was
di&s;patched in a minute; but the lady e&s;|caped,
for the &s;ervants had heard the firing,
and came up before &s;he could be taken
care of. 'Bertrand' &s;aid the Signor, when
$is men returned&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&endq;Bertrand!&endq; exclaimed Emily, pale
with horror, on whom not a &s;yllable of this
narrative had been lo&s;t.</P>
<P>&endq;Bertrand, did I &s;ay?&endq; rejoined the man,
with &s;ome confu&s;ion&mdash;&endq; No, Giovanni
But I have forgot where I was;&mdash;Ber|trand
&endq;&s;aid the Signor.&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&endq;Bertrand, again!&endq; &s;aid Emily, in a
faltering voice,&endq; Why do you repeat
that name?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="181">
Bertrand &s;wore.&endq; What &s;ignifies it,&endq; he
proceeded,&endq; what the man was called&mdash;
Bertrand, or Giovanni&mdash;or Roberto? it's
all one for that. You have put me out
twice with that&mdash;que&s;tion. 'Bertrand,
or Giovanni&mdash;or what you will 'Ber|trand,
&s;aid the Signor, 'if your comrades
had done their duty, as well as you, I
&s;hould not have lo&s;t the lady. Go, my
hone&s;t fellow, and the happy with this.'
He gave him a pur&s;e of gold&mdash;and little
enough too, con&s;idering the &s;ervice he had
done him.&endq;</P>
<P>&endq;Aye, aye,&endq; &s;aid Ugo, &endq;little enough
&mdash;little enough.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily now breathed with difficulty, and
could &s;carcely &s;upport her&s;elf. When fir&s;t &s;he
&s;aw the&s;e men, their appearance and their
connection with. Montoni had been &s;uffi|cient
to- impre&s;s her with di&s;tru&s;t but
now, when one of them had betrayed
him&s;elf to be a murderer, and &s;he &s;aw her|&s;elf,
at the approach of night, under his
guidance, among wild and &s;olitary moun|tains,
<PB N="180" REF="182">
and going &s;he &s;carcely knew whither,
the mo&s;t agonizing terror &s;eized her, which
was the le&s;s &s;upportable from the nece&s;&s;ity
&s;he found her&s;elf under of concealing all
&s;ymptoms of it from her companions.
Reflecting on the character and the me|naces
of Montoni, it appeared not impro|bable,
that he had delivered her to them,
for the purpo&s;e of having her murdered,
and of thus &s;ecuring to him&s;elf, without
further oppo&s;ition, or delay, the e&s;tates,
for which he had &s;o long and &s;o. de&s;perately
contended. Yet, if this was his de&s;ign,
there appeared no nece&s;&s;ity for &s;ending
her to &s;uch a di&s;tance from the ca&s;tle; for,
if any dread of di&s;covery had made him
unwilling to perpetrate the deed there, a
much nearer place might have &s;ufficed
for the purpo&s;e of concealment. The&s;e
con&s;iderations, however, did not imme|diately
occur to Emily, with whom &s;o
many circum&s;tances con&s;pired. to rou&s;e
terror, that &s;he had no power to oppo&s;e it,
or to enquire coolly into its grounds; and,
<PB N="181" REF="183">
if &s;he had done &s;o, &s;till there were many
appearances which: would too well have
ju&s;tified her mo&s;t terrible apprehen&s;ions.
She did not now dare to &s;peak to her con|ductors,
at the &s;ound of who&s;e voices &s;he
trembled; and when, now and then, &s;he
&s;tole a glance at them their countenances,
&s;een imperfectly through the gloom of
evening, &s;erved to confirm her fears.</P>
<P>The fun had now been &s;et &s;ome time;
heavy clouds, who&s;e lower &s;kirts were
tinged with &s;ulphureous crim&s;on, lingered
in the we&s;t, and threw a reddi&s;h tint upon
the pine fore&s;ts,. which &s;ent forth a &s;olemn
&s;ound, as the breeze rolled over them.
The hollow moan &s;truck upon Emily's
heart, and &s;erved to render more gloomy
and terrific every object around her,&mdash;
the mountains, &s;haded in twilight&mdash;the
gleaming torrent, hoar&s;ely roaring&mdash;the
black fore&s;ts, and the deep glen, broken
into rocky rece&s;&s;es, high over&s;hadowed by
cypre&s;s and &s;ycamore and winding into
long ob&s;curityv To this glen, Emily, as
<PB N="182" REF="184">
&s;he &s;ent forth her anxious eye, thought
there was no end; no hamlet, or even
cottage, was &s;een, and &s;till no di&s;tant bark
of watch-dog, or even faint, far-off halloo
came on the wind. In a tremulous, voice,
&s;he now ventured to remind the guides, that
it was growing late, and to a&s;k, again how
far they had to go: but they were too
much occupied by their own di&s;cour&s;e to
attend to her que&s;tion, which &s;he forbore
to repeat, left it &s;hould provoke a &s;urly
an&s;wer. Having, however, &s;oon after, fi|nished
their &s;upper, the men, collected the
fragments into their wallet, and proceed|ed
along, this winding glen, in gloomy
&s;ilence; while Emily again mu&s;ed upon
her own &s;ituation, and concerning the mo|tives
of Montoni for involving her in it.
That it was for &s;ome evil purpo&s;e towards
her&s;elf, &s;he could not doubt; and it &s;eemed,
that, if he did not intend to de&s;troy her,
with a view of immediately &s;eizing her
e&s;tates, he meant to re&s;erve her a-while
in concealment, for &s;ome more terrible de|&s;ign,
<PB N="183" REF="185">
for one that might equally gratify his
avarice and &s;till more his deep revenfe.
At this moment, remembering Signor
Brochio and his behaviour in the corridor,
a few preceding nights, the latter &s;uppo|&s;ition
horrible as it was, &s;trengthened in her belief.
Yet, why romove her from the
ca&s;tle, where deeds of darkne&s;s had, &s;he
feared, been often executed with &s;ecrecy?
&mdash;from chambers, perhaps
<Q>With many a foul, and midnight murder &s;tain'd&endq;</Q></P>
<P>The dread of what &s;he might be going
to encounter was now &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that it
&s;ometimes threatened her &s;en&s;es; and,
often as &s;he-went &s;he thought of her late
father and, of al1 he would have &s;uffered,
could he have fore&s;een the &s;trange and
dreadful events of her future life; and
how anxiou&s;ly he would have avoided that
fatal confidence, which committed his
daughter to the care of a woman &s;o weak
as was Madame Montoni. So romantic
<PB N="184" REF="186">
and improbable, indeed, did her pre&s;ent
&s;ituation appear to Emily her&s;elf, particu|larly
when &s;he compared it with the repo&s;e
and beauty of her early days, that there
were moments, when &s;he could almo&s;t have
believed her&s;elf the victim of frightful
vi&s;ions, glaring upon a di&s;ordered fancy.</P>
<P>Re&s;trained by the pre&s;ence of her guides
from expre&s;&s;ing her terrors, their acutene&s;s
was, at length, lo&s;t in gloomy de&s;pair.
The dreadful view of what might await
her hereafter rendered her almo&s;t indiffer|ent
to the &s;urrounding dangers. She now
looked, with little emotion, on the wild
dingles, and the gloomy road and moun|tains,
whofe outlines only were di&s;tingui&s;h|able
through the du&s;k;&mdash;objects, which but
lately had affected her &s;pirits &s;o much, as
to awaken horrid views of the future, and
to tinge the&s;e with their own gloom</P>
<P>It was now &s;o nearly dark, that the tra|vellers,
who proceeded only by the &s;lowe&s;t
pace, could, &s;carcely di&s;cern their way.
The clouds, which &s;eemed charged with
<PB N="185" REF="187">
thunder, pa&s;&s;ed &s;lowly along the heavens,
&s;hevving, at intervals, the trembling &s;tars;
while the groves of cypre&s;s and &s;ycamore,
that overhung the rocks, waved high in
the breeze, as it &s;wept over the glen, and
then ru&s;hed among the di&s;tant woods.
Emily &s;hivered as it pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>&endq;Where is the torch?&endq; &s;aid Ugo, &endq;It
grows dark.&endq;</P>
<P>&endq;Not &s;o dark yet,&endq; replied Bertrand,
&endq;but we may find our way, and 'tis be&s;t
not light the torch, before we can help,
for it may betray us, if any &s;truggling
party of the enemy is abroad&endq;</P>
<P>Ugo muttered &s;omething, which Emily
did not under&s;tand, and they proceeded
in darkne&s;s, while &s;he almo&s;t wi&s;hed, that
the enemy might di&s;cover them; for
from change there was &s;omething to hope,
&s;ince &s;he could &s;carcely imagine any &s;itu|ation
more dreadful than her pre&s;ent one.</P>
<P>As they moved &s;lowly along, her atten|tion
was &s;urpri&s;ed by a thin tapering flame,
that appeared, by fits at the point of the
<PB N="186" REF="188">
pike, which Bertrand carried, re&s;embling
what &s;he had ob&s;erved on the lance of the
&s;entinel, the night Madame Montoni died,
and which he had &s;aid was an omen. The
event immediately following it appeared to
ju&s;tify the a&s;&s;ertion, and a &s;uper&s;titious
impre&s;&s;ion had remained on Emily's mind,
which the pre&s;ent appearance confirmed.
She thought it was an omen of her own
fate, and watched it &s;ucce&s;&s;ively vani&s;h
and return, in gloomy &s;ilence, which was
at length, interrupted by Bertrand.</P>
<P>&endq;Let us light the torch&endq; &s;aid he, &endq;and
get under &s;helter of the woods;&mdash;a &s;torm
is coming on&mdash;look at my lance.&endq;</P>
<P>He held it forth, with the flame tapering
at its point<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See the A$bc Berthelon on Electricity.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>&endq;Aye,&endq; &s;aid Ugo, &endq;you are not one of
tho&s;e, that believe in omens: we have
left cowards at the ca&s;tle, who would turn
pale at &s;uch a-&s;ight. I have often &s;een it
before a thunder &s;torm, it is an omen of
<PB N="187" REF="189">
that, and one is coming now, &s;ure enoug$
The clouds fla&s;h fa&s;t already.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily was relieved by this conver&s;ation
from &s;ome of the terrors of &s;uper&s;tition,
but tho&s;e of rea&s;on increa&s;ed, as, waiting
while Ugo &s;earched for a flint, to &s;trike
fire, &s;he watched the pale lightning glearn
over the woods they were about to enter,
and illumine the har&s;h countenances of
her companions. Ugo could not find a
flint, and Bertrand became impatient, for
the thunder &s;ounded hollowly at a di&s;tance,
and the lightning was more frequent
Sometimes, it revealed the nearer rece&s;&s;es
of the woods, or, di&s;playing &s;ome opening
in their &s;ummits, illumined the ground be|neath
with partial &s;plendour, the thick fo|liage
of the trees pre&s;erving the &s;urround|ing
&s;cene in deep &s;hadow.</P>
<P>At length, Ugo found a flint, and the
torch was lighted. The men then di&s;|mounted,
and having a&s;&s;i&s;ted Emily, led
the mules towards the woods, that &s;kirted
the glen, on the left, over broken ground,
frequently interrupted with bru&s;h-wood
<PB N="188" REF="190">
and wild plants, which &s;he was often obliged
to make a circuit to avoid.</P>
<P>She could not approach the&s;e woods
without experiencing keener &s;en&s;e of her
danger. Their deep &s;ilence, except when
the wind &s;wept among their branches, and
impenetrable glooms &s;hewn partially by
the &s;udden fla&s;h, and then, by the red
glare of the torch, which &s;erved only to
make &endq;darkne&s;s vi&s;ible,&endq; were circum|&s;tances,
that contributed to renew all her
mo&s;t terrible apprehen&s;ions; &s;he thought,
too, that, at this moment, the countenances
of her conductors di&s;played more than
their u&s;ual fiercene&s;s, mingled with a kind
of lurking exultation, which they &s;eemed
endeavouring to di&s;gui&s;e. To her af|frighted
fancy it occurred, that they were
leading her into the&s;e woods to complete
the will of Montoni by her murder. The
horrid &s;ugge&s;tion called a groan from her
heart, which &s;urpri&s;ed her companions,
who turned round quickly towards her,
and &s;he demanded why they led her thither,
<PB N="189" REF="191">
be&s;eeching them to continue their way
along the open glen, which &s;he repre&s;ented
to be le&s;s dangerous than the woods, in a
thunder &s;torm.</P>
<P>&endq;No, no,&endq; &s;aid Bertrand, &endq;we know
be&s;t where the danger lies. See how the
clouds open over our heads. Be&s;ides, we
can glide under cover of the woods with
le&s;s hazard of being &s;een, &s;hould any of
the enemy be wandering this way. By
holy St. Peter and all the re&s;t of them,
I've as &s;tout a heart as the be&s;t, as many a
poor devil could tell, if he were alive
again&mdash;but what can we do again&s;t num|bers?</P>
<P>&endq;What are you whining about?&endq; &s;aid
Ugo, contempruou&s;ly,&startq;who fears num|bers!
Let them come, though they were as
many, as the Signor's ca&s;tle could hold; I
would &s;hew the knaves what fighting is.
For you&mdash;I would lay you quietly in a
dry ditch, where you might peep out, and
&s;ee me put the rogues to flight.&mdash;Who
talks of fear!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="192">
Bertrand replied, with an horrible oaih
that he did not$ike $ch je&s;ting, and a
violent altercation enfued, which was, at
length, &s;ilenced by the thunder, who&s;e deep
volley was heard afar, rolling onward till
it bur&s;t over their heads in &s;ounds, that
&s;eemed to &s;hake the earth to its centre.
The ru&s;&s;ians pau&s;ed, and looked upon each
other. Between the boles of the trees, the
blue lightning fla&s;hed and quivered along
the ground, while, as Emily looked under
the boughs, the mountains beyond fre|quently
appeared to be clothed in livid
flame. At this moment perhaps, &s;he felt
le&s;s fear of the &s;torm, than did either of her
companions, for other terrors occupied her
mind.</P>
<P>The men now re&s;ted under an enor|mous
che&s;nut-tree, and fixed their pikes in
the ground, at &s;ome di&s;tance, on the iron
points of which Emily repeatedly ob&s;erved
the lightning play, and then glide down
them into the earth.</P>
<P>&endq;I would we were well in the Signor's
<PB N="191" REF="193">
ca&s;tle!&endq; &s;aid Bertrand, &endq;I know not why he
&s;hould &s;end us on this bu&s;ine&s;s. Hark!
how it rattles, above, there! I could almo&s;t
find in my heart to turn prie&s;t, and pray.
Ugo, ha&s;t got a ro&s;ary?&endq;</P>
<P>&endq;No,&endq; replied Ugo, &endq;I leave it to cow|ards
like thee, to carry ro&s;aries&mdash;I, carry a
&s;word.&endq;</P>
<P>&endq;And much good may it do thee in
fighting again&s;t the &s;torm!&endq; &s;aid Bertrand.</P>
<P>Another peal, which was reverberated in
tremendous echoes among the mountains,
&s;ilenced them for a moment. As it rolled
away, Ugo propo&s;ed going on. &endq;We are
only lo&s;ing time here,&endq; &s;aid he, &endq;for the
thick boughs of the woods will &s;helter us as
well as this che&s;nut-tree.&endq;</P>
<P>They again led the mules forward, be|tween
the boles of the trees, and over path|le&s;s
gra&s;s, that concealed their high knotted
roots. The ri&s;ing wind was now heard
contending with the thunder, as it ru&s;hed
&s;uriou&s;ly among the branches above, and
brightened the red flame of the torch
<PB N="192" REF="194">
which threw a &s;tronger light forward among
the woods, and &s;hewed their gloomy re|ce&s;&s;es
to be &s;uitable re&s;orts for the wolves,
of which Ugo had formerly &s;poken.</P>
<P>At length, the &s;trength of the wind
&s;eemed to drive the &s;torm before it, for the
thunder rolled away into di&s;tance, and was
only faintly heard. After travelling through
the woods for nearly an hour, during
which the elements &s;eemed to have returned
to repo&s;e, the travellers, gradually a&s;cend|ing
from the glen, &s;ound them&s;elves upon
the open brow of a mountain, with a wide
valley, extending in mi&s;ty moon-light, at
their feet, and above, the blue &s;ky, trem|bling
through the few thin clouds, that
lingered after the &s;torm, and were &s;inking
&s;lowly to the verge of the horizon.</P>
<P>Emily's &s;pirits, now that &s;he had quitted
the woods, began to revive; for &s;he con|&s;idered,
that, if the&s;e men had received an
order to de&s;troy her, they would probably
have executed their barbarous purpo&s;e in
the &s;olitary wild, from whence they had ju&s;t
<PB N="193" REF="195">
emerged, where the deed would have been
&s;hrouded from every human eye. Rea&s;&s;ured
by this, reflction, and by the quiet de|meanour
of her guides, Emily, as they
proceeded &s;ilently, in a kind of &s;heep
track, that wound along the &s;$irts of
the woods, which a&s;cended on the right,
could not &s;urvey the &s;leeping beauty of
the vale, to which they were declining,
without a momentary &s;en&s;ation of plea&s;ure.
It &s;eemed varied with woods, pa&s;tures, and
&s;loping grounds, and was &s;creened to the
north and the ea&s;t by an amphitheatre
of the Apennines, who&s;e outline on the ho|rizon
was here broken into varied and ele|gant
forms; to the we&s;t and the &s;outh, the
land&s;cape extended indi&s;tinctly into the
lowlands of Tu&s;cany.</P>
<P>&endq;There is the &s;ea yonder,&endq; &s;aid Bertrand,
as if he had known that Emily was exa|mining
the twilight view, &endq;yonder in the
we&s;t, though we cannot &s;ee it.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily-already perceived a change in the
climate, from that of the wild and moun|tainous
tract &s;he had left; and, as &s;he con|tinued
<PB N="194" REF="196">
de&s;cending, the air became perfumed
by the breath of a thou&s;and namele&s;s flow|ers
among the gra&s;s, called forth by the late
rain. So &s;oothingly beautiful was the
&s;cene around her, and &s;o &s;trikingly con|tra&s;ted
to the gloomy grandeur of tho&s;e,
to which &s;he had long been confined,
and to the manners of the people, who
moved among them, that &s;he could almo&s;t
have fancied her&s;elf again at La Vall&eacute;e,
and, wondering why Montoni had &s;ent
her hither, could &s;carcely believe, that he
had &s;elected &s;o enchanting a &s;pot for any
cruel de&s;ign. It was, however, probably
not the &s;pot, but the per&s;ons, who happen|ed
to inhabit it, and to who&s;e care he could
&s;afely commit the execution of his plans,
whatever they might be, that had deter|mined
his choice.</P>
<P>She now ventured again to enquire,
whether they were near the place of their
de&s;tination, and was an&s;wered by Ugo, that
they had not far to go. &endq;Only to the
wood of che&s;nuts in the valley yonder,
<PB N="195" REF="197">
&s;aid he, &endq;there, by the brook, that &s;parkles
with the moon I wi&s;h I was once at re&s;t
there, with a fla&s;k of good wine, and a
&s;lice of Tu&s;cany bacon.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily's &s;pirits revived, when &s;he heard,
that the journey was &s;o nearly concluded,
and &s;aw the wood of che&s;nuts in an open
part of the vale, on the margin of the
&s;tream.</P>
<P>In a-&s;hort time, they reached the entrance
of the wood, and perceived, between the
twinkling leaves, a light, &s;treaming from a
di&s;tant cottage window. They proceeded
along the edge of the brook to where the
trees, crowding over it; excluded the moon|beams,
but a long line of light, from the
cottage above, was &s;een on its dark tremulous
&s;urface. Bertrand now &s;tepped on
fir&s;t, and Emily heard him knock, and call
loudly at the door. As &s;he reached it, the
&s;mall upper ca&s;ement, where the light ap|peared,
was unclo&s;ed by a man, who, having
enquired what they wanted, immediately
de&s;cended, let them into a neat ru&s;tic cor,
<PB N="196" REF="198">
and called up his wife to &s;et refre&s;hments
before the travellers. As this man con|ver&s;ed,
rather apart, with Bertrand, Emily
anxiou&s;ly &s;urveyed him. He was a tall,
but not robu&s;t, pea&s;ant, of a fallow com|plexion,
and had a &s;hrewd and cunning
eye; his countenance was not of a charac|ter
to win the ready confidence of youth,
and there was nothing in his manner, that
might conciliate a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>Ugo called impatiently for &s;upper, and
in a tone as if he knew his authority here

hour ago,&endq; &s;aid the pea&s;ant, &endq;for I have
had Signor Montoni's letter the&s;e three
hours and I and my wife had given you
up, and gone to bed. How did you fare
in the &s;torm?&endq;</P>
<P>Ill enough,&endq; replied Ugo, &endq;ill enough,
and we are like to fare ill enough here, too,
unle&s;s you will make more ha&s;te. Get us
more wine, and let us &s;ee what you have
to eat.&endq;</P>
<P>The pea&s;ant placed before them all, that
<PB N="197" REF="199">
his cottage afforded&mdash;ham, wine, figs, and
grapes of &s;uch fize and flavour, as Emily
had &s;eldom ta&s;ted.</P>
<P>After saking refre&s;hment, &s;he was &s;hewn
by the pea&s;ant's wife to her little bed cham|ber,
where &s;he a&s;ked &s;ome que&s;tions con|cerning
Montoni, to which the woman,
who&s;e name was Dorina, gave re&s;erved an|&s;wers,
pretending ignorance of his <HI>Excel-lenza's</HI>

but acknowledging that her hu&s;band had
been apprized of the circum&s;tance. Per|ceiving,
that &s;he could obtain no intelli|gence

di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Dorina, and retired to repo&s;e;but
all the bu&s;y &s;cenes of the pa&s;t and the anti|cipated

<P>WHEN Emily, in the morning, open|ed
her ca&s;ement, &s;he was &s;urpri&s;ed to ob&s;erve
the beauties, that &s;urrounded it. The
cottage was nearly embowered in the woods,
which were chiefly of che&s;nut, intermixed
with &s;ome cypre&s;s, larch and &s;ycamore.
Beneath the dark and &s;preading branches
appeared, to the north, and to the ea&s;t,
the woody Apennines, ri&s;ing in maje&s;tic
amphitheatre, not black with pines, as &s;he
had been accu&s;tomed to &s;ee them, but their
<PB N="199" REF="201">
loftie&s;t &s;ummits crowned with antient fo|re&s;ts
of che&s;nut, oak, and oriental plane,
now animated with the rich tints of au|tumn,
and which &s;wept downward to the
valley uninterruptedly, except where &s;ome
bold rocky promontory looked out from
among the foliage, and caught the pa&s;&s;ing
gleam. Vineyards &s;tretched along the feet
of the mountains, where the elegant villas
of the Tu&s;can nobility frequently adorned
the &s;cene, and overlooked &s;lopes clothed
with groves of olive, mulberry, orange and
lemon The plain, to which the&s;e declined,
was coloured with the riches of cultivation,
who&s;e mingled hues were mellowed into
harmony by an Italian &s;un Vines, their
purple clu&s;ters blu&s;hing between the ru&s;|&s;et
foliage, hung in luxuriant fe&s;toons from
the branches of &s;tandard fig and cherry
trees, while pa&s;tures of verdure, &s;uch as
$mily had &s;eldom &s;een in I$aly, enriched
the banks of a &s;tream that, after de&s;cending
from the mountains, wound along the land|$cape,
which it reflected, to a bay of the
<PB N="200" REF="202">
&s;ea. There, far in the we&s;t, the waters,
fading into the &s;ky, a&s;&s;umed a tint of the
fainte&s;t purple, and the line of &s;eparation
between them was, now and then, di&s;$rn|ible
only by the progre&s;s of a sail, brighten|ed
with the &s;un-beam, along the horizon.</P>
<P>The cottage, which was &s;haded by the
woods from the inten&s;er rays of the &s;un,
and was open only to his evening light,
was covered entirely with vines, fig- trees
and je&s;&s;amine, who&s;e flowers &s;urpai&s;&s;ed in
&s;ize and fragrance any that Emily had &s;een.
The&s;e and ripening clu&s;ters of grapes hung
round her little ca&s;ement. The turf, that
grew $der the woods, was inlaid with a
variety of wild flowers and perfumed herbs,
and, on the oppo&s;ite margin of the &s;tream,
who&s;e current diffu&s;ed fre&s;hne&s;s beneath
the &s;hades, ro&s;e a grove of lemon and
orange trees. This, though nearly oppo|&s;ite
to Emily's window, did not interrupt
her pro&s;pect, but rather heightened, by
its dark verdure, the effect of the per&s;pec|tive;
and to her this &s;pot was a bower of
<PB N="201" REF="203">
&s;weets, who&s;e charms communicated im|perceptibly
to her mind &s;o <HI>mewhat</HI> of their
own &s;erenity</P>
<P>She was &s;oon &s;ummoned to breakfa&s;t.
by the pea&s;ant's daughter, a girl about &s;e|venteen,
of a plea&s;ant countenance, which,
Emily was glad to ob&s;erve, &s;eemed ani|mated
with the pure affections of nature,
though the others, that &s;urrounded her,
expre&s;&s;ed, more or le&s;s, the wor&s;t quali|ties
&mdash;cruelty, ferocity cunning and dupli|city;
of the latter &s;tyle of countenance,
e&s;pecially, were tho&s;e of the pea&s;ant and
his wife. Maddelina &s;poke little, but
what &s;he &s;aid was in a &s;oft voice, and with
an air of mode&s;ty and complacency, that
intere&s;ted Emily, who breakfa&s;ted at a &s;e|parate
table with Dorina, while Ugo and
Bertrand were taking a repa&s;t of Tu&s;cany
bacon and wine with their ho&s;t, near the
cottage door; when they had fini&s;hed which,
Ugo, ri&s;ing ha&s;tily, enquired for his mule,
and Emily learned that he was to return to
Udolpho, while Bertrand remained at the
<PB N="202" REF="204">
cottage; a cicum&s;tance, Which, though it
did not &s;urpri&s;e, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed her.</P>
<P>When Ugo was departed, Emily pro|po&s;fed to walk in the neighbouring woods;
but, on being told, that &s;he mu&s;t not quit
the cottage, without having Bertrand for
her attendant, &s;he withdrew to her own
room. There, as her eyes &s;ettled on the
towering Apennines, &s;he recollected the ter|rific
&s;cenery they had exhibited and the
horrors &s;he had &s;uffered, on the preceding
night, particularly at the moment when
Bertrand had betrayed him&s;elf to be an a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;in;
and the&s;e remembrances awakened
a train of images, which, &s;ince they ab|&s;tracted
her from a con&s;ideration of her own
&s;ituation, &s;he pur&s;ued for &s;ome time, and
then arranged in the following lines; plea&s;ed
to have di&s;covered any innocent means, by
which &s;he could beguile an hour of mi&s;|fortune.</P>

Preferring the &s;olitude of her room to the
company of the per&s;ons below &s;tairs, Emily
dined above, and Maddelina was &s;uffered to
attend her, from who&s;e &s;imple conver&s;ation
&s;he learned, that the pea&s;ant and his wife
were old inhabitants of this cottage, which
had been purcha&s;ed for them by Montoni,
in reward of &s;ome &s;ervice, rendered him,
many years before, by Marco, to whom
Carlo, the &s;teward at the ca&s;tle, was
nearly related. &startq;So many years ago, Signora,&endq;
added Maddelina, &startq;that I know nothing
about it; but my father did the Signer a
great good, for my mother has often &s;aid
to him, this cottage was the lea&s;t he ought
to have had.&endq;</P>
<P>To the mention of this circum&s;tance
Emily li&s;tened with a painful intere&s;t, &s;ince
it appeared to give a frightful colour to
the character of Marco, who&s;e &s;ervice,
thus rewarded by Montoni, &s;he could
&s;$arcely doubt had been criminal; and, if
&s;o, had too much rea&s;on to believe, that &s;he had been committed into his hands for &s;ome de&s;perate purpo&s;e. &startq;Did you ever hear
<PB N="205" REF="207">
how many years it is,&endq; &s;aid Emily, who
was con&s;idering of Signora Laurentini's
di&s;appearance from Udolpho, &startq;&s;ince your
father performed the &s;ervices you &s;poke
of?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It was a little before he came to live at
the cottage, Signora,&endq; replied Maddelina,
&startq;and that is about eighteen years ago.&endq;</P>
<P>This was near the period, when Signora
Laurentini had been &s;aid to di&s;appear, and
it occurred to Emily, that Marco had af|&s;i&s;ted
in that my&s;terious affair, and, per|haps,
had been employed in a murder!
This horrible &s;ugge&s;tion fixed her in &s;uch
profound reverie, that Maddelina quitted
the room, unperceived by her, and &s;he re|mained
unconfcious of all around her,
for a con&s;iderable time. Tears, at length,
came to her relief, after indulging which,
her &s;pirits becoming calmer, &s;he cea&s;ed to
tremble at a view of evils, that might ne|ver
arrive; and had &s;ufficient re&s;olution
to endeavour to withdraw her thoughts
from the contemplation of her own in|tere&s;ts.
Remembering the few books,
<PB N="206" REF="208">
which even in the hurry of her departure
from Udolpho &s;he had put into her little
package, &s;he &s;at down with one of them
at her plea&s;ant ca&s;ement, whence her eyes
often wandered from the page to the land|&s;cape,
who&s;e beauty gradually &s;oothed her
mind into gentle melancholy.</P>
<P>Here, &s;he remained alone, till evening,
and &s;aw the &s;un de&s;cend the we&s;ter$ sky, throw all his pomp of light and &s;hadow
upon the mountains, and gleam upon the
di&s;tant ocean and the &s;tealing &s;ails, as he
&s;unk amid&s;t the waves. Then, at the mu&s;|ing
hour of twilight, her &s;oftened thoughts
returned to Valancourt; &s;he again recol|lected
every circum&s;tance, connected with
the midnight mu&s;ic, and all that might a&s;|&s;i&s;t her conjecture, concerning his
impri&s;on|ment
at the ca&s;tle, and, becoming con|firmed
in the &s;uppo&s;ition, that it was his
voice &s;he had heard there, &s;he looked back
to that gloomy abode with emotions of grief
and momentary regret</P>
<P>Refre&s;hed by the cool and fragrant air,
<PB N="207" REF="209">
and her &s;pirits &s;oothed to a &s;tate of gentle
melancholy by the &s;tilly murmur of the
brook below and of the woods around, &s;he lingered at her ca&s;ement long after the &s;un
had &s;et, watching the valley &s;inking into
ob&s;curity, till only the grand outline of the
&s;urrounding mountains, &s;hadowed upon
the horizon, remained vi&s;ible. But a clear
moon-light, that &s;ucceeded, gave to the
land&s;cape, what time gives to the &s;cenes
of pa&s;t life, when it &s;oftens all their har&s;h|er
features, and throws over the whole
the mellowing &s;hade of di&s;tant contempla|tion.
The &s;cenes of La Vall&eacute;e, in the early morn of her
life, when &s;he was protected
and beloved by parents equally loved, ap|peared
in Emily's memory tenderly beau|tiful,
like the pro&s;pect before her, and
awakened mournful compari&s;ons Un|willing
to encounter the coar&s;e behaviour
of the pea&s;ant's wife, &s;he remained
&s;upper|le&s;s in her room, while &s;he wept
again over her forlorn and perilous &s;ituation, a
review of which entirely overcame the &s;mall re|mains
<PB N="208" REF="210">
of her fortitude, and, reducing her
to temporary de&s;pondence, &s;he wi&s;hed to
be relea&s;ed from this heavy load of life, that
had &s;o long oppre&s;&s;ed her, and prayed to
Heaven to take her, in its mercy, to her
parents.</P>
<P>Wearied with weeping, &s;he, at length,
lay down on her mattre&s;s, and &s;unk to
&s;leep, but was &s;oon awakened by a knock|ing
at her chamber door, and, &s;tarting up
in terror, &s;he heard a voice calling her.
The image of Bertrand, with a &s;tilletto in
his hand, appeared to her alarmed fancy,
and &s;he neither opened the door, or an|&s;wered, but li&s;tened in profound &s;ilence, till, the voice repeating her name in the
&s;ame low tone, &s;he demanded who called.
&startq;It is I, Signora,&endq; replied the voice, which
&s;he now di&s;tingui&s;hed to be Maddelina's,
&startq;pray open the door. Don't be frighten|ed,
it is I&endq;.</P>
<P>&startq;And what brings you here &s;o late,
Maddelina?&endq; &s;aid Emily, as &s;he let her in
&startq;Hu&s;h! Signora, for heaven's &s;ake hu&s;h!
<PB N="209" REF="211">
&mdash;if we are overheard I &s;hall never be for|given.
My father and mother and Ber|trand
are all gone to bed,&endq; continued
Maddelina, as &s;he gently &s;hut the door,
and crept forward, &startq;and I have brought
you &s;ome &s;upper, for you had none, you
know, Signora, below &s;tairs Here are
&s;ome grapes and figs and half a cup of wine.&endq;
Emily thanked her, but expre&s;&s;ed
apprehen&s;ion left this kindne&s;s &s;hould draw
upon her the re&s;entment of Dorina, when
&s;he perceived the fruit was gone. &startq;Take it
back, therefore, Maddelina,&endq; added Emily,
&startq;I &s;hall &s;uffer much le&s;s from the
want of
it, than I &s;hould do, if this act of good|nature
was to &s;ubject you to your mother's
di&s;plea&s;ure.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O Signora! there is no danger of that,&endq;
replied Maddelina, &startq;my mother cannot
mi&s;s the fruit, for I &s;aved it from my own
$upper. You will make me very unhappy,
if you refu&s;e to take it, Signora.&endq; Emily
was &s;o much affected by this in&s;tance of
the good girl's genero&s;ity, that &s;he remained
<PB N="210" REF="212">
for &s;ome time unable to reply, and Mad|delina
watched her in &s;ilence, till, mi&s;tak|ing
the cau&s;e of her emotion, &s;he &s;aid, &startq;Do
not weep &s;o, Signora! My mother, to be
&s;ure, is a little cro&s;s, &s;ometimes, but then
it is &s;oon over,&mdash;&s;o don't take it &s;o much
to heart. She often &s;colds me, too, but then
I have learned to bear it, and, when &s;he has
done, if I can but &s;teal out into the
woods, and play upon my &s;ticcado, I for|get
it all directly.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily, &s;miling through her tears, told
Maddelina, that &s;he was a good girl, and then
accepted her offering. She wi&s;hed
anxiou&s;ly to know, whether Bertrand and
Dorina had &s;poken of Montoni, or of his
de&s;igns, concerning her&s;elf, in the pre&s;ence
of Maddelina, but di&s;dained to tempt the
innocent girl to a conduct &s;o mean, as that
of betraying the private conver&s;ation of her
parents. When &s;he was departing, Emily
reque&s;ted, that &s;he would come to her
room as often as &s;he dared, without offend|ing
her mother, and Maddelina, after pro|mi&s;ing,
<PB N="211" REF="213">
that &s;he would do &s;o, &s;tole &s;oftly
back gain to her own chamber</P>
<P>Thus &s;everal days pa&s;&s;ed, during
which Emily remained in her own room, Mad|delina
attending her only at her repa&s;t,
who&s;e gentle countenance and manners
&s;oothed her more than any circum&s;tance
&s;he had known for many months. Of her
plea&s;ant embowered chamber &s;he now be|came
fond, and began to experience in it
tho&s;e feelings of &s;ecurity, which we natu|rally
attach to home. In this interval al&s;o,
her mind, having been undi&s;turbed by
any new circum&s;tance of di&s;gu&s;t, or alarm,
recovered its tone &s;ufficiently to permit her
the enjoyment of her books, among which
&s;he found &s;ome unfini&s;hed &s;ketches of
land|&s;capes, &s;everal blank &s;heets of paper,
with her drawing in&s;truments, and &s;he was
thus enabled to amu&s;e her&s;elf with &s;electing
&s;ome of the lovely features of the pro&s;pect,
that her window commanded, and com|bining
them in &s;cenes, to which her ta&s;te|ful
fancy gave a la&s;t grace. In the&s;e little
<PB N="212" REF="214">
&s;ketches &s;he generally placed intere&s;ting
groups, characteri&s;tic of the &s;cenery they
animated, and often contrived to tell,
with per&s;picuity, &s;ome &s;imple and affect|ing
&s;tory, when, as a tear fell over the
pictured griefs, which her imagination
drew, &s;he would forget, for a moment,
her real &s;ufferings. Thus innocently &s;he
beguiled the heavy hours of misfortune,
and, with meek patience, awai$d the
events of futurity.</P>
<P>A beautiful evening, that had &s;ucceeded
to a &s;ultry day, at length induced Emily to
walk, though &s;he knew that Bertrand mu&s;t
attend her, and, with Maddelina for her
companion, &s;he left the cottage, followed
by Bertrand, who allowed her to choo&s;e
her own way. The hour was cool and
&s;ilent, and &s;he could not look upon the
country around her, without delight. How
lovely, too, appeared the brilliant blue,
that coloured all the upper region of the
air, and, thence fading downward, was
lo&s;t in the &s;affron glow of the horizon!
<PB N="213" REF="215">
Nor $s $o were the varied &s;hades and
warm colouring of the Apennines, as the
evening &s;un threw his &s;lanting rays athwart
their broken &s;urface. Emily followed the
cour&s;e of the &s;tream, under the &s;hades,
that overhung its gra&s;&s;y margin. On the
oppo&s;ite banks, the pa&s;tures were animated
with herds of cattle of a beautiful cream|colour;
and, beyond, were groves of le|mon
and orange, with fruit glowing on the
branches, frequent almo&s;t as the leaves,
which partly concealed it. She pur&s;ued
her way towards the &s;ea, which reflected
the warm glow of &s;un-&s;et, while the cliffs,
that ro&s;e over its edge, were tinted with
the la&s;t rays. The valley was terminated
on the right by a lofty promontory, who&s;e
&s;ummit, impending over the waves, was
crowned with a ruined tower, now &s;erving
for the purpo&s;e of a beacon, who&s;e &s;hat|tered
battlements and the extended wings
of &s;ome &s;ea-fowl, that circled near it, were
&s;till illumined by the upward beams of the
&s;un, though his di&s;k was now &s;unk beneath
<PB N="214" REF="216">
the horizon; while the lower part of the
ruin, the cliff on which it &s;tood and the
waves at its foot, were &s;haded with the
fir&s;t tints of twilight.</P>
<P>Having reached this headland, Emily
gazed with &s;olemn plea&s;ure on the cliffs,
that extended on either hand along the
&s;e|que&s;tered &s;hores, &s;ome crowned with
groves of pine, and others exhibiting only barren
precipices of a grayi&s;h marble, except
where the crags were tufted with myrtle
and other aromatic &s;hrubs. The &s;ea &s;lept
in a perfect calm; its waves, dying in
murmurs on the &s;hores, flowed with the
gentle&s;t undulation, while its clear &s;urface
reflected in &s;oftened beauty the vermeil
tints of the we&s;t. Emily, as &s;he looked
upon the ocean, thought of France and
of pa&s;t times, and &s;he wi&s;hed, Oh! how
ardently, and vainly&mdash;wi&s;hed! that its
waves would bear her to her di&s;tant, na|tive
home!</P>
<P>&startq;Ah! that ve&s;&s;el,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &startq;that ve&s;&s;el, which glides along &s;o &s;tately, with
<PB N="215" REF="217">
its tall &s;ails reflected in the water, is, per|haps,
bound for France! Happy&mdash;happy
bark!&endq; She continued to gaze upon it,
with warm emotion, till the gray of twi|light
ob&s;cured the di$tance, and veiled it
from her view. The melancholy &s;ound of
the waves at her feet a&s;&s;i&s;ted the tender|ne&s;s, that occa&s;ioned her tears, and
this was the only &s;ound, that broke upon the
hour, till, having followed the windings

voices pa&s;&s;ed her on the air. She pau&s;ed
a moment, wi&s;hing to hear more, yet fear|ing
to be &s;een, and, for the fir&s;t time, looked
back to Ber$and, as her protector, who
was following, at a &s;hort di&s;tance, in com|pany
with &s;ome other per&s;on. Rea&s;&s;ured
by this circum&s;tance, &s;he advanced to|wards
the &s;ounds, which &s;eemed to ari&s;e
from behind a high promontory, that
projected athwart the beach There was
now a &s;udden pau&s;e in the mu&s;ic, and then
one female voice was heard to &s;ing in a
kind of chant Emily quickened her

&s;teps, and, winding round the rock, &s;aw
within the &s;weeping bay, beyond, which
was hung with woods from the borders of
the beach to the very &s;ummit of the cliffs,
two groups of pea&s;ants, one &s;eated beneath
the &s;hades, and the other &s;tanding on the
edge of the &s;ea, round the girl,&startq;who was
&s;inging, and who held in her hand a chap|let
of flowers, which &s;he &s;eemed about to
drop into the waves</P>
<P>Emily, li&s;tening with &s;urpri&s;e and atten|tion,
di&s;tingui&s;hed the following
invocation delivered in the pure and elegant
tongue of Tu&s;cany and accompanied by a few pa&s;|toral
in&s;truments.</P>

<L>O nymph! who loves to float on the green wave,</L>

<P>The la&s;t words being repeated by the
&s;urrounding group, the garland of flowers
was thrown into the waves, and the chorus,
&s;inking gradually into a chant, died away
in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>&startq;What can this mean, Maddelina?&endq; &s;aid
Emily, awakening from the plea&s;ing trance,
into which the mu&s;ie had lulled her.
&startq;This is the eve of a fe&s;tival, Signora,&endq;
replied Maddelina; &startq;and the pea&s;ants then
amu&s;e them&s;elves with all kinds of &s;ports.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But they talked of a &s;ea-nymph,&endq; &s;aid
Emily: &startq;how came the&s;e good people to
think of a &s;ea-nymph&endq;?</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="220">
&startq;O, Signora,&endq; rejoined Maddelina, mi&s;|taking
the rea&s;on of Emily's &s;urpri&s;e, &startq;no|body
<HI>believes</HI> in &s;uch things, but our old
&s;ongs tell of them, and, when we are at
our &s;ports, we &s;ometimes &s;ing to them,
and throw garlands into the &s;ea.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily had been early taught to vene|rate
Florence as the &s;eat of literature and
of the fine arts; but, that its ta&s;te for cla&s;|&s;ic
&s;tory &s;hould de&s;cend to the pea&s;ants of
the country, occa&s;ioned her both &s;urpri&s;e
and admiration. The Arcadian air of the
girls next attracted her attention. Their
dre&s;s was a very &s;hort full petticoat of light
green, with a boddice of white &s;ilk; the
&s;leeves loo&s;e, and tied up at the &s;houlders
with ribbons and bunches of flowers. Their
hair, falling in ringlets on their necks,
was al&s;o ornamented with flowers, and with
a &s;mall &s;traw hat, which, &s;et rather back|ward
and on one &s;ide of the head, gave an
expre&s;&s;ion of gaiety and &s;martne&s;s to the
whole figure. When the &s;ong had con|cluded,
&s;everal of the&s;e girls approached
<PB N="219" REF="221">
Emily, and, inviting her to &s;it down
among them, offered her, and Maddelina,
whom they knew, grapes and figs.</P>
<P>Emily accepted their courte&s;y, much
plea&s;ed with the gentlene&s;s and grace of
their manners, which appeared to be per|fectly
natural to them: and when Bertrand,
&s;oon after, approached, and was ha&s;tily
drawing her away, a pea&s;ant, holding up
a fla&s;k, invited him to drink; a tempta|tion,
which Bertrand was &s;eldom very va|liant
in re&s;i&s;ting.</P>
<P>&startq;Let the young lady join in the dance,
my friend, &endq;&s;aid the pea&s;ant,&startq; while we
empty this fla&s;k. They are going to begin
directly. Strike up! my lads, &s;trike up
your tambourines and merry flutes!&endq;</P>
<P>They &s;ounded gaily; and the younger
pea&s;ants formed them&s;elves into a circle,
which Emily would readily have joined, had
her &s;pirits been in uni&s;on with their, mirth.
Maddelina, however, tripped it lightly, and
Emily, as &s;he looked on the happy group,
lo&s;t the &s;en&s;e of her misfortunes in that of
<PB N="220" REF="222">
a benevolent plea&s;ure. But the pen&s;ive
melancholy of her mind returned, as &s;he
&s;at rather apart from the company, li&s;tening
to the mellow mu&s;ic, which the breeze &s;oft|ened
as it, bore it away, and watching the
moon, &s;tealing its tremulous light over the
waves and on the woody &s;ummits of the
cliffs, that wound along the&s;e Tu&s;can
&s;hores.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Bertrand was &s;o well plea&s;ed
with his fir&s;t fla&s;k, that he very willingly
commenced the attack of a &s;econd, and it
was late before Emily, not without &s;ome
apprehen&s;ion, returned to the cottage.</P>
<P>After this evening, &s;he frequently walked
with Maddelina, but was never unattended
by Bertrand; and her mind became by
degrees as tranquil as the circum&s;tances of
her $ituation would permit. The quiet, in
which &s;he was &s;uffered to live, encouraged
her to hope, that &s;he was not &s;ent hither
with an evil de&s;ign; and, had it not ap|peared
probable, that Valancourt was at
this $ime an inhabitant of Udolpho, &s;he
<PB N="221" REF="223">
would have wi&s;hed to remain at the cot|tage,
till an opportunity &s;hould offer of
returning to her native country. But,
concerning Montoni's motive for &s;ending
her into Tu&s;cany, &s;he was more than ever
perplexed, nor could &s;he believe that any
con&s;ideration for her &s;afety had influenced
him on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>She had been &s;ome time at the cottage,
before &s;he recollected, that, in the hurry
of leaving Udolpho, &s;he had forgotten the
papers committed to her by her late aunt,
relative to the Languedoc e&s;tates; but,
though this remembrance occa&s;ioned her
much unea&s;ine&s;s, &s;he had &s;ome hope,
that, in the ob&s;cure place, where they were de|po&s;ited,
they would e&s;cape the detection
of Montoni.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<Q><L>&startq;My tongue hath but a heavier tale to &s;ay.</L>
<L>I play the torturer, by &s;mall and &s;mall,</L>
<L>To lengthen out the wor&s;t that mu&s;t be &s;poken.&endq;</L>
<BIBL>RlCHARD II.</BIBL></Q>
<P>We now return, for a moment, to
Venice, where Count Morano was &s;uffer|ing
under an accumulation of misfortunes.
Soon after his arrival in that city, he had
been arre&s;ted by order of the Senate, and,
without knowing of what he was &s;u&s;pected,
was conveyed to a place of confinement,
whither the mo&s;t &s;trenuous enquiries of his
friends had been unable to trace him.
Who the enemy was, that had occa&s;ioned
him this calamity, he had not been able
to gue&s;s, unle&s;s, indeed, it was Montoni,
on whom his &s;u&s;picions re&s;ted, and not
only with much apparent probability, but
with ju&s;tice.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="225">
In the affair of the poi&s;oned cup, Mon|toni
had$ &s;u&s;pected Morano; but, being
unable to obtain the degree of proof,
which was nece&s;&s;ary to convict him of a
guilty intention he had recour&s;e to means
of other revenge, than he could hope to
obtain by pro&s;ecution. He employed a
per&s;on, in whom he believed he might
confide, to drop a letter of accu&s;ation into
the <HI>Denunzie &s;ecrete,</HI> or lions' mouths,
which are fixed in a gallery of the Doge's
palace, as receptacles for anonymous infor|mation,
concerning per&s;ons, who may be
di&s;affected towards the &s;tate. As, on the&s;e
occa&s;ions, the accu&s;er is not confronted with
the accu&s;ed, a man may fal&s;ely impeach his
enemy, and accompli&s;h an unju&s;t revenge,
without fear of puni&s;hment, or detection.
That Montoni &s;hould have recour&s;e to
the&s;e diabolical means of ruining a per&s;on,
whom he &s;u&s;pected of having attempted
his life, is not in the lea&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing. In
the letter, which he had employed as the
in&s;trument of his revenge, he accu&s;ed
<PB N="224" REF="226">
Morano'of de&s;igns again&s;t the &s;tat$, which
he attempted to prove, with all the plau|&s;ible
&s;implicity of which he was ma&s;ters;
and the &s;enate, with whom a &s;u&s;picion was,
at that time, almo&s;t equal to a proof, ar|re&s;ted
the Count, in con&s;equence of this
accu&s;ation; and, without even hinting to
him his crime, threw him into one of
tho&s;e &s;ecret pri&s;ons, which were the terror
of the Venetians, and in which per&s;ons
often langui&s;hed, and &s;ometimes died,
without being di&s;covered by their friends.</P>
<P>Morano had incurred the per&s;onal re|&s;entment
of many m$mbers of the &s;tate;
his habits of life had rendered him obnoxi|ous
to &s;ome; and his ambition, and the
bold rival&s;hip, which he di&s;covered, on
&s;everal public occa&s;ions,&mdash;to others; and
it was not to be expected, that mercy
would &s;often the rigour of a law, which
was to be di&s;pen&s;ed from the hands of his
enemies</P>
<P>Montoni, meantime, was be&s;et by dan|gers
of another kind His ca&s;tle was b|&s;ieged
<PB N="225" REF="227">
by troops, who &s;eemed willing to
dare every thing, and to &s;uffer patiently
any hard&s;hips in pur&s;uit of victory. The
&s;trength of the fortre&s;s, however, with&s;tood
their attack, and this, with the vigorous
defence of the garri&s;on and the &s;carcity
of provi&s;ion on the&s;e wild mountains, &s;oon
compelled the a&s;&s;ailants to rai&s;e the &s;iege.</P>
<P>When Udolpho was once more left to
the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Montoni, he di&s;|patched
Ugo into Tu&s;cany for Emily,
whom he had &s;ent from con&s;iderations of
her per&s;onal &s;afety, to a place of greater
&s;ecurity, than a ca&s;tle, which was, at that
time, liable to be overrun by his ene|mies.
Tranquillity being once more re|&s;tored
to Udolpho, he was impatient to
&s;ecure her again under his roof, and had
commi&s;&s;ioned Ugo to a&s;&s;i&s;t Bertrand in
guarding her back to the ca&s;tle. Thus
compelled to return, Emily bade the kind
Maddelina farewell, with regret, and, af|ter
about a fortnight's &s;tay in Tu&s;cany,
where &s;he had experienced an interval of
<PB N="226" REF="228">
quiet, which was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to
&s;u&s;tain her long-hara&s;&s;ed &s;pirits, began once
more to a&s;cend the Apennines, from who&s;e
heights &s;he gave a long and &s;orrowful look
to the beautiful country, that extended at
their feet, and to the di&s;tant Mediterranean,
who&s;e waves &s;he had &s;o often wi&s;hed would
bear her back to France. The di&s;tre&s;s &s;he
felt, on her return towards the place of her
former &s;ufferings, was, however, &s;oftened
by a conjecture, that Valancourt was there,
and &s;he found &s;ome degree of comfort in
the thought of being near him, notwith|&s;tanding
the con&s;ideration, that he was pro|bably
a pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>It was noon, when &s;he had left the cot|tage,
and the evening was clo&s;ed, long before
&s;he came within the neighbourhood of
Udolpho. There was a moon, but $it
&s;hone only at intervals, for the night was
cloudy, and, lighted by the torch, Which
Ugo carried, the travellers paced &s;ilently
along, Emily mu&s;ing on her &s;ituation, and
Bertrand and Ugo anticipating the comforts
<PB N="227" REF="229">
of a fla&s;k of wine and a good fire, for they
had perceived for &s;ome time the difference
between the warm climate of the lowlands
of Tu&s;cany and the nipping air of the&s;e
upper regions. Emily was, at length,
rou&s;ed from her reverie by the far-off
&s;ound of the ca&s;tle clock, to which &s;he li&s;ten|ed
not without &s;ome degree of awe, as it rolled
away on the breeze. Another and another
note &s;ucceeded, and died in &s;ullen mur|mur
among the mountains:&mdash;to her mourn|ful
imagination it &s;eemed a knell mea&s;uring
out &s;ome fateful period for her.</P>
<P>&startq;Aye, there is the old clock, &endq; &s;aid Ber|trand,
&startq;there he is &s;till; the cannon
have not &s;ilenced him!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No,&endq; an&s;wered Ugo, &startq;he crowed as
loud as the be&s;t of them in the mid&s;t of it
all. There he was roaring out in the
hotte&s;t fire 1 have &s;een this many a day!
I &s;aid that &s;ome of them would have a
hit at the old fellow, but he e&s;caped, and
the tower too.&endq;</P>
<P>The road winding round the ba&s;e of a
<PB N="228" REF="230">
mountain, they now came within view of
the ca&s;tle, which was &s;hewn in the per&s;pec|tive
of the valley by a gleam of moon|&s;hine,
and then vani&s;hed in &s;hade; while
even a tran&s;ient view of it had awakened
the poignancy of Emily's feelings. Its
ma&s;&s;y and gloomy walls gave her terri|ble
ideas of impri&s;onment and &s;uffering:
yet, as &s;he advanced, &s;ome degree of hope
mingled with her terror; for, though this
was certainly the re&s;idence of Montoni,
it was po&s;&s;ibly, al&s;o, that of Valancourt, and
&s;he could not approach a place, where he
might be, without experiencing &s;omewhat
of the joy of hope.</P>
<P>They continued to wind along the val|ley,
and, &s;oon after, &s;he &s;aw again the
old walls and moon-light towers, ri&s;ing
over the woods: the &s;trong rays ena|bled
her, al&s;o, to perceive the ravages,
which the &s;iege had made,&mdash;with the
broken walls, and &s;hattered battlements,
for they were now at the foot of the &s;teep,
on which Udolpho &s;tood Ma&s;&s;y frag|ments
<PB N="229" REF="231">
had rolled down among the woods,
through which the travellers now began to
a&s;cend, and there mingled with the loo&s;e
earth, and pieces of rock they had brought
with them. The woods, too, had &s;uffered
much from the batteries above, for here
the enemy had endeavoured to &s;creen them|&s;elves
from the fire of the ramparts. Many
noble trees were levelled with the ground,
and others, to a wide extent, were entirely
&s;tripped of their upper branches. &startq;We
had better di&s;mount,&endq; &s;aid Ugo, &startq;and
lead the mules up the hill, or we &s;hall get
into &s;ome of the holes, which the balls
have left. Here are plenty of them. Give
me the torch,&endq; continued Ugo, after they
had di&s;mounted, &startq;and take care you
don't &s;tumble over any thing, that lies in
your way, for the ground is not yet cleared
of the enemy,&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How!&endq; exclaimed Emily.&startq; are any of the enemy here, then?&endq;
&startq;Nay, I don't know for that, now,&endq; he
<PB N="230" REF="232">
replied, &startq;but when I came away I &s;aw
one or two of them lying under the trees$&endq;</P>
<P>As they proceeded, the torch threw a
gloomy light upon the ground, and far
among the rece&s;&s;es of the woods, and
Emily feared to look forward, left &s;ome
object of horror &s;hould meet her eye.
The path was often &s;trewn with broken
heads of arrows, and with &s;hattered re|mains
of armour, &s;uch as at that period
was mingled with the lighter dre&s;s of the
$oldiers. &startq;Bring the light hither,&endq; &s;aid
Bertrand, &startq;I have &s;tumbled over &s;ome|thing,
that rattles loud enough.&endq; Ugo
holding up the torch, they perceived a
&s;teel brea&s;t- plate on the ground, which
Bertrand raif&s;ed, and they &s;aw, that it was
pierced through, and that the lining was
entirely covered with blood; but upon
Emily's earne&s;t entreaties, that they would
proceed, Bertrand, uttering &s;ome joke up|on
the unfortunate per&s;on, to whom it had
belonged, threw it hard upon the ground,
and$they pa&s;&s;ed on.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="233">
At every &s;tep &s;he took, Emily feared to
&s;ee &s;ome ve&s;tige of death. Coming &s;oon
after to an opening in the woods, Bertrand
&s;topped to &s;urvey the ground, which was
encumbered with ma&s;&s;y trunks and branches
of the trees, that had &s;o lately adorned it,
and &s;eemed to have been a &s;pot particu|larly
fatal to the be&s;iegers; for it was evident
from the de&s;truction of the trees, that
here the hotte&s;t fire of the garri&s;on had
been directed. As Ugo held again forth
the torch, &s;teel glittered between the fallen
trees; the ground beneath was covered
with broken arms, and with the torn ve&s;t|ments
of &s;oldiers, who&s;e mangled forms
Emily almo&s;t expected to &s;ee; and &s;he
again entreated her companions to pro|ceed,
who were, however, too intent in
their examination, to regard her, and &s;he
turned her eyes frem this de&s;olated &s;cene
to the ca&s;tle above, where &s;he ob&s;erved
lights gliding along the ramparts. Pre|&s;ently,
the ca&s;tle clock &s;truck twelve, and
<PB N="232" REF="234">
then a trumpet &s;ounded, of which Emily
enquired the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>&startq;O! they are only changing watch,&endq;
replied Ugo. &startq;I do not remember this
trumpet,&endq; &s;aid Emily, &startq;it is a new cu&s;|tom.&endq;
&startq;It is only an old one revived,
lady; we always u&s;e it in time of war.
We have &s;ounded it, at midnight, ever
&s;ince the place was be&s;ieged.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Hark!&endq;&s;aid Emily, as the trumpet
founded again; and, in the next moment,
&s;he heard a faint cla&s;h of arms, and then
the watch-word pa&s;&s;ed along the terrace
above, and was an&s;wered from a di&s;tant
part of the ca&s;tle; after which all was again
&s;till. She complained of cold, and begged
to go on. &startq;Pre&s;ently, lady,&endq; &s;aid Ber|trand,
turning over &s;ome broken arms
with the pike he u&s;ually carried. &startq;What
have we here?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Hark!&endq; cried Emily, &startq;what noi&s;e was
that?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What noi&s;e was it?&endq; &s;aid Ugo, &s;tart|ing
up and li&s;tening.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="235">
&startq;Hu&s;h!&endq; repeated Emily &startq;It &s;urely
came from the ramparts above.&endq; and, on
looking up, they perceived a light moving
along the walls, while, in the next in&s;tant,
the breeze &s;welling, the voice &s;ounded
louder than before.</P>
<P>&startq;Who goes yonder?&endq; cried a &s;entinel
of the ca&s;tle. &startq;Speak, or it will be wor&s;e
for you.&endq; Bertrand uttered a &s;hout of joy.
&startq;Hah! my brave comrade, is it you?&endq;
&s;aid he, and he blew a &s;hrill whi&s;tle, which
&s;ignal was an&s;wer$d by another from the
&s;oldier on watch; and the party, then
pa&s;&s;ing forward, &s;oon after emerged from
the woods upon the broken road, that led
immediately to the ca&s;tle gates, and Emily
&s;aw, with renewed terror, the whole of
that &s;tupendous &s;tructure. &startq;Alas!&endq; &s;aid
&s;he to her&s;elf, &startq;I am going again into my
pri&s;on!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Here has, been warm work, by St.
Marco!&endq;cried Bertrand, waving the torch
over the ground; the balls have torn up
the earth here, with a vengeance.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="236">
&startq;Aye,&endq; replied Ugo, &startq;they were fired
from that redoubt, yonder, and rare exe|cution
they did. The enemy made a fu|rious
attack upon the great gates; but
they might have gue&s;&s;ed they could never
carry it there; for, be&s;ides the cannon from
the walls, our archers, on the two roun$
towers, &s;howered down upon them at &s;uch
a rate, that, by holy Peter! there was no
&s;tanding it. I never &s;aw a better &s;ight in
my life; I laughed, till my &s;ides aked, to
&s;ee how the knaves &s;campered Bertrand,
my good fellow, thou &s;hould&s;t have been
among them; I warrant thou would&s;t
have won the race!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Hah! you are at your old tricks
again,&endq; &s;aid Bertrand in a &s;urly tone. &startq;It
is well for thee thou art &s;o near the ca&s;tle;
thou knowe&s;t I have killed my man before
now&endq; Ugo replied only by a laugh, and
then gave &s;ome further account of the &s;iege,
to which as Emily li&s;tened, &s;he was &s;truck by the &s;trong contra&s;t of the pre&s;ent &s;cene
<PB N="235" REF="237">
with that which had &s;o lately been acted
here.</P>
<P>The mingled uproar of cannon, drums,
and trumpets, the groans of the conquered,
and the &s;houts of the conquerors were now
&s;unk into a &s;ilence &s;o profound, that it
&s;eemed as if death had triumphed alike
over the vanquished and the victor. The
&s;hattered condition of one of the towers of the
great gates by no means confirmed the
<HI>valiant</HI> account ju&s;t given by Ugo of the
&s;campering party, who, it was evident, had
not only made a &s;tand, but had done much
mi&s;chief before they took to flight; for this
tower appeared, as far as Emily could
judge by the dim moon-light that fell
upon it, to be laid open, and the battle|ments
were nearly demoli&s;hed. While &s;he
gazed, a light glimmered through one of the lower
loop-holes, and di&s;appeared; but,
in the next moment, &s;he perceived through
the broken wall, a &s;oldier, with a lamp, a&s;|cending
the narrow &s;tair-ca&s;e, that wound
within the tower, and, remembering that
<PB N="236" REF="238">
it was the &s;ame &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed up, on the
night; when Barnardine had deluded her
with a promi&s;e of &s;eeing Madame Montoni,
fancy gave her &s;omewhat of the terror &s;he
had then &s;uffered She was now very
near the gates, over which the &s;oldier
having opened the door of the portal-chamber,
the lamp he carried gave her a
du&s;ky view of that terrible apartment,
and &s;he almo&s;t &s;unk under the recollected
horrors of the moment, when &s;he had
drawn a&s;ide the curtain, and di&s;covered the
object it was meant to conceal</P>
<P>&startq;Perhaps, &startq;&s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, &startq;it is
now u&s;ed for a &s;imilar purpo&s;e; perhaps
that &s;oldier goes, at this dead hour, to
watch over the corp&s;e of his friend!&endq; The
little remaines of her fortitude now gave
way to the united force of remembered and
anticipated horrors, for the melancholy fate
of Madame Montoni appeared to foretell
her own She con&s;idered, that, though
the Languedoc e&s;tates, if &s;he relinqui&s;hed
them, would &s;atisfy Montoni's avarice,
<PB N="237" REF="239">
they might not appea&s;e his vengeance,
which was &s;eldom pacified but by a terri|ble
&s;acrifice; and &s;he even thought, that,
were &s;he to re&s;ign them, the fear of ju&s;tice
might urge him either to detain her a pri|&s;oner,
or to take away her life</P>
<P>They were now arrived at the gates,
where Bertrand, ob&s;erving the light glim|mer
through a &s;mall ca&s;ement of the
portal-chamber, called aloud; and the
&s;oldier, looking out, demanded who was
there &startq;Here, I have brought you a
pri&s;oner,&endq; &s;aid Ugo, &startq;open the gate, and
let us in.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Tell me fir&s;t who it is, that demands
entrance,&endq;replied the &s;oldier. &startq;What!
my old comrade,' cried Ugo, &startq;don't you
know me? not know Ugo? I have brought
home a pri&s;oner here, bound hand and foot
&mdash;a fellow, who has been drinking Tu&s;cany
wine, while we here have been fighting.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You will not re&s;t till you meet with your
match,&startq;&s;aid Bertrand &s;ullenly &startq;Hah! my
<PB N="238" REF="240">
comrade, is it you?&startq;&s;aid the &s;oldier&mdash;&startq;I'll
be with, you directly.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily pre&s;ently heard his &s;teps de&s;cend|ing
the &s;tairs within, and then the heavy
chain fall, and the bolts undraw of a &s;mall po&s;tern door, which he opened to admit
the party. He held the lamp low, to
&s;hew the &s;tep of the gate, and &s;he found
her&s;elf once more beneath the gloomy arch,
and heard the door clo&s;e, that &s;eemed to
&s;hut her from the world for ever. In the
next moment, &s;he was in the fir&s;t court of
the ca&s;tle, where she &s;urveyed the &s;pacious
and &s;olitary area, with a kind of calm de|&s;pair;
while the dead hour of the night,
the gothic gloom of the &s;urrounding build|ings,
and the hollow and imperfect echoes,
which they returned, as Ugo and the &s;ol|dier
conver&s;ed together, a&s;&s;i&s;ted to increa&s;e
the melancholy forebodings of her heart.
Pa&s;&s;ing on to the &s;econd court, a di&s;tant
&s;ound broke feebly on the &s;ilence, and gra|dually
&s;welling louder, as they advanced,</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="241">
Emily di&s;tingui&s;hed voices of revelry and
laughter, but they were to her far other
than sounds of joy. &startq;Why, you have
got &s;ome Tu&s;canywine among you, <HI>here,</HI>&endq;
&s;aid Bertrand, &startq;if one may judge by the
uproar that is going forward. Ugo has taken a larger &s;hare of that than of fight|ing,
I'II be &s;worn. Who is carou&s;ing at
this late hour?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;His <HI>Excellenza</HI> and the Signors,&endq; replied
the &s;oldier: &startq;it is-a$-&s;ign you are a
&s;tranger at the ca&s;tle, or you would not
need to a&s;k the que&s;tion. They are brave
&s;pirits, that do without &s;leep&mdash;they gene|rally
pa&s;s the night in good cheer; would
that we, who keep the watch, had a little
of it! It is cold work, pacing the ramparts
&s;o many hours of the night, if one has no
good liquor to warm one's heart.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Courage, my lad, courage ought to
warm your heart&endq; &s;aid Ugo. &startq;Courage!&endq;
replied the &s;oldier &s;harply, with a menacing
air, which Ugo perceiving, prevented his
&s;aying more, by returning to the &s;ubject of
<PB N="240" REF="242">
the carou&s;al. &startq;This is a new cu&s;tom,&endq;
&s;aid he; &startq;when I left the ca&s;tle, the Sig|nors
u&s;ed to &s;it up coun&s;elling.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Aye, and for that matter, carou&s;ing
too,&endq; replied Ugo, &startq;but, &s;ince the &s;iege,
they have done nothing but make merry:
and if I was they, I would &s;ettle accounts
with my&s;elf, for all my hard fighting,
the &s;ame way&endq;</P>
<P>They had now cro&s;&s;ed the &s;econd court,
and reached the hall door, when the &s;ol|dier,
bidding them good night, ha&s;tened
back to his po&s;t; and, while they waited
for admittance, Emily con&s;idered how &s;he
might avoid &s;eeing Montoni, and retire un|noticed
to her former apartment, for &s;he
&s;hrunk from the thought of encountering
either him, or any of his party, at this
hour. The uproar within the ca&s;tle was
now &s;o loud, that$ though Ugo knocked re|peatedly
at the hall door, he was not heard
by any of the &s;ervants, a circum&s;tance,
which increa&s;ed Emily's alarm, while it al|lowed
her time to deliberate on the means
<PB N="241" REF="243">
of retiring unob&s;erved; for, though &s;he
might, perhaps, pa&s;s up the great &s;tair|ca&s;e
un&s;een, it was impo&s;&s;ible &s;he could find the
way to her chamber, without a light, the
difficulty of procuring which, and the
danger of wandering about the ca&s;tle,
without one, immediately &s;truck her.
Bertrand had only a torch, and &s;he knew,
that the &s;ervants never brought a taper to
the door, for the hall was &s;uffciently light|ed
by the large tripod lamp, which hung in
the vaulted roof, and, while &s;he &s;hould
wait till Annette could bring a taper,
Montoni, or &s;ome of his companions, might
di&s;cover her</P>
<P>The door was now opened by Carlo; and
Emily, having reque&s;ted him to &s;end An|nette
immediately with a light to the great
gallery, where &s;he determined to await her,
pa&s;&s;ed on with ha&s;ty &s;teps towards the &s;tair|ca&s;e;
while Bertrand and Ugo, with the
torch, followed old Carlo to the &s;ervants'
hall, impatient for &s;upper and the warm
blaze of a wood fire. Emily, lighted only by
<PB N="242" REF="244">
the feeble rays, which the lamp above
threw between the arches of this exten&s;ive
hall, endeavoured to find her way to the
&s;tair|ca&s;e, now hid in ob&s;curity; while
the &s;houts of merriment, that bur&s;t from a
remote apartment, &s;erved, by heightening
her terror, to increa&s;e her perplexity, and
&s;he expected, every in&s;tant, to &s;ee the door
of that room open, and Montoni and his
companions i&s;&s;ue forth. Having, at length,
reached the &s;tair|ca&s;e, and found her way
to the top, &s;he &s;eated her&s;elf on the la&s;t
&s;tair, to await the arrival of Annette; for
the profound darkne&s;s of the gallery de|terred
her from proceeding farther, and,
while &s;he li&s;tened for her foot&s;tep, &s;he heard
only di&s;tant &s;ounds of revelry, which ro&s;e
in fullen echoes from among the arcades
below Once &s;he thought &s;he heard a low
&s;ound from the dark gallery behind her;
and, turning her eyes, fancied &s;he &s;aw
&s;omething luminous move in it; and,
&s;ince &s;he could not, at this moment, &s;ub|due
the weakne&s;s that cau&s;ed her fears, &s;he
<PB N="243" REF="245">
quitted her &s;eat, and crept &s;oftly down a
few &s;lairs lower.</P>
<P>Annette not yet appearing, Emily now
concluded, that &s;he was gone to bed, and
that nobody cho&s;e to call her up; and the
pro&s;pect, that pre&s;ented it&s;elf, of pa&s;&s;ing the
night in darkne&s;s, in this place, or in &s;ome
other equally forlorn (for &s;he knew it would
be impracticable to find her way through
the intricacies of the galleries to her cham|ber),
drew tears of mingled terror and
de&s;pondency from her eyes</P>
<P>While thus &s;he &s;at, &s;he fancied &s;he heard
again an odd &s;ound from the gallery, and,
&s;he li&s;tened, &s;carcely daring to breathe, but
the increa&s;ing voices below overcame every
other &s;ound. Soon after, &s;he heard Mon|toni
and his companions bur&s;t into the
hall, who &s;poke, as if they were much in|toxicated,
and &s;eemed to be advancing
towards the &s;tair|ca&s;e. She now remem|bered,
that they mu&s;t come this way to their
chamber, and, forgetting all the terrors of
the gallery, hurried towards it with an in|tention
<PB N="244" REF="246">
of &s;ecreting her&s;elf in &s;ome of the
pa&s;&s;ages, that opened beyond, and of en|deavouring,
when the Signors were retired,
to find her way to her own room, or to that
of Annette, which was in a remote part of
the ca&s;tle</P>
<P>With extended arms, &s;he crept along the
gallery, &s;till hearing the voices of per&s;ons
below, who &s;eemed to &s;top in conver&s;ation
at the foot of the &s;tair|ca&s;e, and then
pau&s;ing for a moment to li&s;ten, half fear|ful
of going further into the darkne&s;s of
the gallery, where &s;he &s;till imagined, from
the noi&s;e &s;he had heard, that &s;ome per&s;on
was lurking, &startq;They are a lready inform|ed
of my arrival,&endq;&s;aid &s;he, &startq;and Montoni
is coming him&s;elf to &s;eek me! In the pre|&s;ent
&s;tate of his mind, his purpo&s;e mu&s;t be
de&s;perate&endq;Then, recollecting the &s;cene, that
had pa&s;&s;ed in the corridor, on the night pre|ceding
her departure from the ca&s;tle, &startq;O
Valancourt!&endq;&s;aid &s;he, &startq;I mu&s;t then re|&s;ign
you for ever To brave any longer
the inju&s;tice of Montoni, would not be
<PB N="245" REF="247">
fortitude, but ra&s;hne&s;s.&endq;Still the voices
below did not draw nearer, but they be|came
louder, and &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed tho&s;e
of Verezzi and Bertolini above the re&s;t,
while the few words &s;he caught made her
li&s;ten more anxiou&s;ly for others. The
conver&s;ation &s;eemed to concern her&s;elf;
and, having ventured to &s;tep a few paces
nearer to the &s;tair-ca&s;e, &s;he di&s;covered, that
they were di&s;puting about her, each &s;eem|ing
to claim &s;ome former promi&s;e of Mon|toni,
who appeared, at fir&s;t, inclined to
appea&s;e and to per&s;uade them to return to
their wine, but afterwards to be weary of
the di&s;pute, and, &s;aying that he left them
to &s;ettle it as they could, was returning
with the re&s;t of the party to the apartment
he had ju&s;t quitted. Verezzi then &s;topped
him &startq;Where is &s;he? Signor,&endq;&s;aid he, in
a voice of impatience:&endq; tell us where &s;he
is.&endq; &startq;I have already told you that I do
not know,&startq;replied Montoni, who &s;eemed
to be &s;omewhat overcome with wine; but
&s;he is mo&s;t probably gone to her apart|ment.&endq;
<PB N="246" REF="248">
Verezzi and Bertolini now de&s;i&s;ted
from the irenquiries, and &s;prang to the &s;tair-ca&s;e
together, while Emily, who, during this
di&s;cour&s;e, had trembled fo exce&s;&s;ively,
that &s;he had with difficulty &s;upported her|&s;elf,
&s;eemed in&s;pired with new &s;trength,
the moment &s;he heard the &s;ound of their
&s;teps, and ran along the gallery, dark as it
was, with the $leetne&s;s of a fawn But,
long before &s;he reached its extremity, the
light, which Verezzi carried, fla&s;hed
upon the walls; both appeared, and, in|ftantly
perceiving Emily, pur&s;ued her.
At this moment, Bertolini, who&s;e, &s;teps,
though &s;wift, were not &s;teady, and who&s;e
impatience overcame what little caution
he had hitherto u&s;ed, &s;tumbled, and fell at
his length. The lamp fell with him, and
was pre&s;ently expiring on the floor; but
Verezzi, regardle&s;s of &s;aving it, &s;eized the
advantage this accident gave him over his ri|val,
and followed Emily, to whom, however,
the light had &s;hown one of the pa&s;&s;ages that
branched from the gallery, and &s;he in&s;tantly
<PB N="247" REF="249">
turned into it. Verezzi could ju&s;t di&s;cern
the way &s;he had taken, and this he pur&s;ued;
but the &s;ound of her &s;teps &s;oon &s;unk in
di&s;tance, while he, le&s;s acquainted with the
pa&s;&s;age, was obliged to proceed through the
dark, with caution, le&s;t he &s;hould fall down
a flight of &s;teps, &s;uch as in this exten&s;ive
old ca&s;tle frequently terminated an ave|nue.
This pa&s;&s;age at length brought
Emily to the corridor, into which her own
chamber. opened, and, not hearing any
foot&s;tep, &s;he pau&s;ed to take breath, and
con&s;ider what was the &s;afe&s;t de&s;ign to be
adopted. She had followed this pa&s;&s;age,
merely becau&s;e it was the fir&s;t that appear|ed,
and now that &s;he had reached the end
of it, was as perplexed as before. Whither
to go, or how further to find her way in the
dark, &s;he knew not; &s;he was aware only
that &s;he mu&s;t not &s;eek her apartment, for
there &s;he would certainly be &s;ought, and
her danger increa&s;ed every in&s;tant, while
&s;he remained near it Her &s;pirits and her
breath, however, were &s;o much exhausted,
<PB N="248" REF="250">
that &s;she was compelled to re&s;st, for a few
minutes, at the end of the pa&s;&s;sage, and
&s;till &s;he heard no &s;teps approaching As
thus &s;he &s;tood, light glimmered under an
oppo&s;ite door of the gallery, and, from its
&s;ituation, &s;he knew, that it was the door of
that my&s;terious chamber, where &s;he had
made a di&s;covery &s;o &s;hocking, that &s;he
never remembered it but with the utmo&s;t
horror That there &s;hould be light in this
chamber, and at this hour, excited her
&s;trong &s;urpri&s;e, and &s;he felt a momentary
terror concerning it, which did not permit
her to look again, for her &s;pirits were now
in &s;uch a &s;tate of weakne&s;s, that &s;he almo&s;t
expected to &s;ee the door &s;lowly open,
and &s;ome horrible object appear at it.
Still &s;he li&s;tened for a &s;tep along the pa&s;&s;age,
and looked up it, where, not a ray of light
appearing, &s;he concluded, that Verezzi
had gone back for the lamp; and, be|lieving
that he would &s;hortiy be there, &s;he
again con&s;idered which way &s;he &s;hould go,
<PB N="249" REF="251">
or rather which way &s;he could find in the
dark.</P>
<P>A &s;aint ray &s;till glimmered under the oppo&s;ite door, but &s;o great, and, perhaps,
&s;o ju&s;t was her horror of that chamber,
that &s;he would not again have tempted its
&s;ecrets, though &s;he had been certain of ob|taining
the light &s;o important to her &s;afety.
She was &s;till breathing with difficulty, and
re&s;ting at the end of the pa&s;&s;age, when &s;he
heard a ru&s;tling &s;ound, and then a low
voice, &s;o very near her, that it &s;eemed
clo&s;e to her ear; but &s;he. had pre&s;ence of
mind to check her emotions, and to re|main
quite &s;till; in the next moment, &s;$e
perceived it to be the voice of Verezzi,
who did not appear to know, that &s;he was
there, but to have &s;poken to him&s;elf.
&startq;The air is fre&s;her here,&endq; &s;aid he: this
&s;hould be the corridor.&endq; Perhaps, he was
one of tho&s;e heroes, who&s;e courage can
defy an enemy better than darkne&s;s, and
he tried to rally his &s;pirits with the &s;ound
of his own voice. However this might be,
<PB N="250" REF="252">
he turned to the right, and proceeded,
with the &s;ame &s;tealing &s;teps, towards
Emily's apartment, apparently forgetting,
that, in darkne&s;s, &s;he could ea&s;ily elude
his &s;earch, even in her chamber; and,
like an intoxicated per&s;on, he followed
pertinaciou&s;ly the one idea, that had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
his imagination.</P>
<P>The moment &s;be heard his &s;teps &s;teal
$way, &s;he left her &s;tation and moved &s;oft|ly
to the other end of the corridor, deter|mined
to tru&s;t again to chance, and to
quit it by the fir&s;t avenue &s;he could find;
but, before &s;he could effect this, light
broke upon the walls of the gallery, and,
looking back, &s;he &s;aw Verezzi cro&s;&s;ing
it towards her chamber. She now glided
into a, pa&s;&s;age, that opened on. the left,
without, as &s;he thought, being perceived;
but, in the next in&s;tant, another light,
glimmering at the further end of this pa&s;|&s;age,
threw her into new terror. While
&s;he &s;topped and he&s;itated which way to go,
the pau&s;e allowed her to perceive, that it
<PB N="251" REF="253">
was Annette, who advanced, and &s;he hur|ried
to meet her: but her imprudence
again alarmed Emily, on perceiving whom,
&s;he bur&s;t into, a &s;cream of joy, and it was
&s;ome minutes, before &s;he could be pre|vailed
with to be &s;ilent, or to relea&s;e her
mi&s;tre&s;s from the ardent cla&s;p, in which &s;he
held her. When, at length, Emily made
Annette comprehend her danger, they
hurried towards Annette's room which
was in a di&s;tant part of the ca&s;tle. No ap|prehen&s;ions,
however, could yet &s;ilence
the latter. &startq;Oh dear ma'am&s;elle,&endq; &s;aid
&s;he, as they pa&s;&s;ed along, &startq;what a terrified
time have I had of it! Oh! I thought I
&s;hould have died an hundred times! I ne|ver
thought I &s;hould live to &s;ee you again!
and 1, never was &s;o glad to &s;ee any body in
my whole life, as I am to &s;ee you now.&endq;
&startq;Hark!&endq; cried Emily, we are pur|&s;ued;
that was the echo of &s;teps!&endq;&startq;No,
ma* am&s;elle,&endq; &s;aid Annette, &startq;it was only
the echo of a door &s;hutting; &s;ound runs
along the&s;e vaulted pa&s;&s;ages$ &s;o, that one
<PB N="252" REF="254">
is continually deceived by it; if one does
but &s;peak, or cough, it makes a noi&s;e as
loud as a cannon.&endq; &startq;Then there is the
greater nece&s;&s;ity for us to be &s;ilent,&endq; &s;aid
Emily: &startq;pr'ythee &s;ay no more, till we
reach your chamber.&endq; Here, at length,
they arrived, without interruption, and,
Annette having fa&s;tened the door., Emily
&s;at down on her little bed, to recover
breath and compo&s;ure. To her enquiry,
whether Valancourt was among the pri&s;on|ers
in the ca&s;tle, Annette replied, that
&s;he had not been able to hear, but that &s;he
knew there were &s;everal per&s;ons confined.
She then proceeded, in her tedious way,
to give an account of the &s;iege, or rather
a detail of her terrors and various &s;uffer|ings,
during the attack.. &startq;But,&endq; added
&s;he, &startq;when I heard the &s;houts of victory
from the ramparts, I thought we were all
taken, and gave my&s;elf up for lo&s;t, in&s;tead
of which, <HI>we</HI> had driven the enemy$away.
I went then to the north gallery, and &s;aw
a great many of them &s;campering away
<PB N="253" REF="255">
among the mountains; but the rampart
walls were all in ruins, as one may &s;ay,
and there was a di&s;mal fight to &s;ee down
among the woods below, where the poor
fellows were lying in heaps, but were
carried off pre&s;ently by their comrades.
While the &s;iege was going on, the Signor
was here, and there, and every where,, at
the &s;ame time, as Ludovico told me, for
he would not let me &s;ee any thing hardly,
and locked me up, as he has often done
before, in a room in the middle of the cat|tle,
and u&s;ed to bring me food, and come
and talk with me as often as he could; and
I mu&s;t &s;ay, if it had not been for Ludovico,
I &s;hould have died outright.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, Annette,&endq; &s;aid Emily, &startq;and
how have affairs gone on, &s;ince the &s;iege?&endq;</P>
<P>O! &s;ad hurly burly doings, ma'am|&s;elle,&endq;
replied Annette; &startq;the Signors
have done nothing but &s;it and drink and
game, ever &s;ince. They &s;it up, all night,
and play among them&s;elves, for all tho&s;e
riches and fine things, they brought in,
<PB N="254" REF="256">
&s;ome time &s;ince, when they u&s;ed to go out
a-robbing, or as good, for days together;
and then they have dreadful quarrels
about, who lo&s;es, and who wins. That
fierce Signor Verezzi is always lo&s;ing, as
they tell me, and Signor Or&s;ino wins from
him, and this makes him very wroth, and
they have had &s;everal hard &s;et-to's about it.
Then, all tho&s;e fine ladies are at the ca&s;tle
&s;till; and I declare I am frighted, when|ever
I meet any of them in the pa&s;&s;ages.&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Surely, Annette,&endq; &s;aid Emily &s;tart|ing,
&startq;I heard a noi&s;e: li&s;ten,&endq; After a
long pau&s;e, No, ma'am&s;elle,&endq; &s;aid
Annette, &startq;it was only the wind in the
gallery; I often hear it, when it &s;hakes
the old doors, at the other end. But
won't you go to bed, ma'am&s;elle? you
&s;urely will not &s;it up &s;tarving, all night.&endq;
Emily now laid her&s;elf down on the mat|tre&s;s,
and de&s;ired. Annette to leave the
lamp burning on the hearth; having done
which, the latter placed her&s;elf be&s;ide
Emily, who, however, was not &s;uffered
<PB N="255" REF="257">
to &s;leep, for &s;he again thought &s;he heard;
a noi&s;e from the pa&s;&s;age; and Annette was
again trying to convince her, that it was
only the wind, when foot&s;teps were dif|tinctly
heard near the door. Annette was
now &s;tarting from the bed, but Emily
prevailed with her to remain there, and:
li&s;tened with her in a &s;tate of terrible expec|tation.
The &s;teps &s;till loitered at the door,
when pre&s;ently an attempt was made on
the lock, and, in the next in&s;tant, a voice
called. &startq;For heaven's &s;ake, Annette,
do not an&s;wer,&endq; &s;aid Emily &s;oftly, &startq;re|main
quite &s;till; but I fear we mu&s;t extin|gui&s;h
the lamp, or its glare will betray
us.&endq; &startq;Holy Virgin!&endq; exclaimed An|nette,
forgetting her di&s;cretion, &startq;I would
not be in darkne&s;s now for the whole
world.&endq; While &s;he &s;poke, the voice be|came
louder than before, and repeated
Annette's name; &startq;Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin!&endq; cried
&s;he &s;uddenly, &startq;it is only Ludovico,&endq;
She ro&s;e to open the door, but Emily pre|vented
her, till they &s;hould be more cer|tain,
<PB N="256" REF="258">
that it was he alone; with whom
Annette,$ at length, talked for &s;ome time,
and learned, that he was come to enquire
after her&s;elf, whom he had let out of her
room to go to Emily, and that he was now
returned to lock her in again. Emily,
fearful of being overheard, if they con|ver&s;ed
any longer through the door, con|&s;ented
that it &s;hould be opened, and a young man
appeared, who&s;e open coun|tenance
confirmed the. favourable opinion
of him, which his care of Annette had al|ready
prompted her to form. She en|treated
his protection, &s;ould Verezzi
make this requi&s;ite; and Ludovico offered
to pa&s;s the night in an old chamber, ad|joining,
that opened from the gallery, and,
on the fir&s;t alarm, to come to their de|fence.</P>
<P>Emily was much &s;oothed by this pro|po&s;al;
and Ludovico, having lighted his
lamp, went to his &s;tation, while &s;he, once
more, endeavoured to repo&s;e on her
mat|tre&s;s. But a variety of intere&s;ts
pre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="257" REF="259">
upon her attention, and prevented &s;leep.
She thought much on what Ann&eacute;tte had
told her of the di&s;&s;olute manners of Mon|toni
and his a&s;&s;ociates, and more of his
pre&s;ent conduct towards her&s;elf, and of
the danger, from which &s;he had ju&s;t e&s;|caped.
From the view of her pre&s;ent &s;itu|ation
&s;he &s;hrunk, as from a new picture of
terror. She &s;aw her&s;elf in a ca&s;tle, inha|bited
by vice and violence, &s;eated beyond
the reach of law, or ju&s;tice, and in the
power of a man, who&s;e per&s;everance was
equal to every occa&s;ion, and in whom pa&s;|&s;ions,
of which revenge was not the weak|e&s;t,
entirely &s;upplied the place of principles.
She was compelled, once more, to ac|knowledge,
that it would be folly, and
not fortitude, any longer to dare his
power; and, re&s;igning all hopes of future
happine&s;s with Valancourt, &s;he deter|mined,
that, on the following morning,
&s;he would compromi&s;e with Montoni,
and give up her e&s;tates, on condition,
that he would permit her immediate return
to France. Such con&s;iderations kept her
<PB N="258" REF="260">
waking for many hours; but, the night
pa&s;&s;ed, without further alarm from Verezzi.</P>
<P>On the next morning, Emily had a
long conver&s;ation with Ludovico, in which
&s;he heard circum&s;tances concerning the
ca&s;tle, and received hints of the de&s;igns
of Montoni, that con&s;iderably increased
her alarms. On expre&s;&s;ing her &s;urpri&s;e, that Ludovico, who &s;eemed to be &s;o &s;en|&s;ible
of the evils of his &s;ituation, &s;hould
continue in it, he informed her, that it
was not his intention to do &s;o, and &s;he
then ventured to a&s;k him, if he would
a&s;&s;i&s;t her to e&s;cape from the ca&s;tle. Lu|dovico
a&s;&s;ured her of his readine&s;s to at|tempt
this, but &s;trongly repre&s;ented the
difficulty of the enterpri&s;e, and the cer|tain
de&s;truction which mu&s;t en&s;ue, &s;hould Montoni overtake them, before they had
pa&s;&s;ed the mountains; he, however, pro|mi&s;ed
to be watchful of every circum|&s;tance,
that might contribute to the &s;uc|ce&s;s
of the attempt, and to think upon
&s;ome plan of departure.</P>
<P>Emily now confided to him the name of
<PB N="259" REF="261">
Valancourt, and begged he would enquire
for &s;uch a per&s;on among the pri&s;oners in
the ca&s;tle; for the &s;aint hope, which this
conver&s;ation awakened, made her now re|cede
from her re&s;olution of an immediate
compromi&s;e wich Montoni. She deter|mined,
if po&s;&s;ible, to delay this, till &s;he
heard further from Ludovico, and, if his
de&s;igns were found to be impracticable, to
re&s;ign the e&s;tates at once. Her thoughts
were on this &s;ubject, when Montoni, who
was now recovered from the intoxication
of the preceding night, &s;ent for her, and
&s;he immediately obeyed the &s;ummons.
He was alone. &startq;I find,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;that
you were not in your chamber, laft night;
where were you?&endq; Emily related to him
&s;ome circum&s;tances of her alarm, and
entreated his protection from a repeti|tion
of them. &startq;You know the terms of
my protection,&endq; &s;aid he; &startq;if you really
value this, you will &s;ecure it.&endq; His open
declaration, that he would only condition|ally
protect her, while &s;he remained a pri|&s;oner
<PB N="260" REF="262">
in the ca&s;tle, &s;hewed Emily the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of an immediate compliance with
his terms; but &s;he fir&s;t demanded, whe|ther
he would permit her immediately to
depart, if &s;he gave up her claim to the
contected e&s;tates. In a very &s;olemn man|ner
he then a&s;&s;ured her, that he would,
and immediately laid before her a paper,
which was to transfer the right of tho&s;e e&s;tates to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>She was, for a con&s;iderable time, un|able
to &s;ign it, and her heart was torn with
contending intere&s;ts, for &s;he was about to re|&s;ign
the happine&s;s of all her future years-the
hope, which had &s;u&s;tained her in &s;o
many hours of adver&s;ity.</P>
<P>After hearing from Montoni a recapitu|lation
of the conditions of her compliance,
and a remon&s;trance, that his time was va|luable,
&s;he put her hand to the paper;
when &s;he had done which, &s;he fell back in
her chair, but &s;oon recovered, and de|&s;ired,
that he would give orders for her
departure, and that he would allow An|nette
<PB N="261" REF="263">
to accompany her. Montoni &s;miled.
&startq;It was nece&s;&s;ary to deceive you,&endq; &s;aid
he, there was no other way of making
you act rea&s;onably; you &s;shall go, but
it mu&s;t not be at pre&s;ent. I mu&s;t fir&s;t
&s;ecure the&s;e e&s;tates by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: when
that is done, you may return to France if
you will.&endq;</P>
<P>The deliberate villany, with which he
violated the &s;olemn engagement he had
ju&s;t entered into, &s;hocked Emily as much,
as the certainty, that &s;he had made a fruit|le&s;s
&s;acrifice, and mu&s;t &s;till remain his
pri&s;oner. She had no words to expre&s;s
what &s;he felt, and knew, that it would
have been usele&s;s, if &s;he had. As &s;he
looked piteou&s;ly at Montoni, he turned
away, and at the &s;ame time de&s;ired &s;he
would withdraw to her apartment; but,
unable to leave the room, &s;he &s;at down in
a chair near the door, and &s;ighed heavily.
She had neither words nor tears,</P>
<P>&startq;Why will you indulge this childi&s;h
grief?&endq; &s;aid he. &startq;Endeavour to &s;trengthen
<PB N="262" REF="264">
your mind, to bear patiently what cannot
now be avoided; you have no real evil to
lament; be patient, and you will be &s;ent
back to France. At pre&s;ent retire to your
apartment.'</P>
<P>I dare not go, &s;ir,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &startq;where
I &s;hall be liable to the intru&s;ion of Signor Verezzi.&endq;
&startq;Have I not promi&s;ed to
protect you?&endq; &s;aid Montoni, &startq;You have
promi&s;ed, &s;ir,&endq;-replied Emily, after
&s;ome he&s;itation. &startq;And is not my pro|mi&s;e
&s;ufficient?&endq; added he &s;ternly. &startq;You
will recollect your former promi&s;e, Signor,&endq;
&s;aid Emily, trembling, &startq;and may de|termine
for me, whether I ought to rely
upon this.&endq; &startq;Will you provoke me to
declare to you, that I will not protect you
then?&endq; &s;aid Montoni, in a tone of haughty
di&s;plea&s;ure. &startq;If that will &s;atisfy you, I
will do it immediately. Withdraw to your
Chamber, before I retract my promi&s;e;
you have nothing to fear there.&endq; Emily
left the room, and moved &s;lowly into$ the
hall; where the fear of meeting Verezzi,
<PB N="263" REF="265">
or Bertolini, made her quicken her &s;teps,
though &s;he could &s;carcely &s;upport her&s;elf;
and &s;oon after &s;he reached once more her
own apartment. Having looked fearfully
round her, to examine if any per&s;on was
there, and having &s;earched every part of
it, &s;he fa&s;tened the door, and &s;at down by
one of the ca&s;ements. Here, while &s;he
looked out for &s;ome hope to &s;upport her
fainting &s;pirits, which had been &s;o long
hara&s;&s;ed and oppre&s;&s;ed, that, if &s;he had
not now &s;truggled much again&s;t misfor|tune,
they would have left her, perhaps,
for ever, &s;he endeavoured to believe, that
Montoni did really intend to permit her return to
France as &s;oon as he had &s;ecured
her property, and that he would, in the
mean time, protect her from in&s;ult; but
her chief hope re&s;ted with Ludovico, who,
&s;he doubted not, would be zealous in her
cau&s;e, though he &s;eemed almo&s;t to de&s;pair
of &s;ucce&s;s in it. One circum&s;tance, how|ever,
&s;he had to rejoice in. Her prud|ence,
or rather her fears, had &s;aved her
<PB N="264" REF="266">
from mentioning the name of Valancourt
to Montoni, which &s;hhe was &s;everal times
on the point of doing, before &s;he &s;igned
the paper, and of &s;tipulating for his re|lea&s;e,
if he &s;hould be really a pri&s;oner in
the ca&s;tle. Had &s;he done this, Montoni's
jealous fears would now probably have
loaded Valancourt with new &s;everities, and
have &s;ugge&s;ted the advantage of holding
him a captive for life.</P>
<P>Thus pa&s;&s;ed the melancholy day, as &s;he
had before pa&s;&s;ed many in this &s;ame cham|ber.
When night drew on, &s;he would
have withdrawn her&s;elf to Annette's bed,
had not a particular intere&s;t inclined her
to remain in this chamber, in &s;pite of her
fears; for, when the ca&s;tle &s;hould be &s;till,
and the cu&s;tomary hour arrived, &s;he de|termined
to watch for the mu&s;ic, which
&s;he had formerly heard. Though its
&s;ounds might not enable her po&s;itively to
determine, whether Valancourt was there,
they would perhaps &s;trengthen her opi|nion
that he was, and impart the comfort,
<PB N="265" REF="267">
&s;o nece&s;&s;ary to her pre&s;ent &s;upport.&mdash;But,
on the other hand, if all &s;hould be &s;ilent&mdash;!
&mdash;She hardly dared to &s;uffer her thoughts
to glance that way, but waited, with im|patient
expectation, the approaching hour.</P>
<P>The night was &s;tormy; the battlements
of the ca&s;tle appeared to rock in the wind,
and, at intervals, long groans &s;eemed to
pa&s;s on the air, &s;uch as tho&s;e, which often
deceive the melancholy mind, in tempe&s;ts,
and amid&s; &s;cenes of de&s;olation. Emily
heard, as formerly, the &s;entinels pa&s;s along
the terrace to their po&s;ts, and, looking out
from her ca&s;ement, ob&s;erved, that the
watch was doubled; a precaution, which
appeared nece&s;&s;ary enough, when &s;he threw
her eyes on the walls, and &s;aw their &s;hat|tered
condition. The well-known &s;ounds of the
&s;oldiers' march, and of their di&s;tant
voices, which pa&s;&s;ed her in the wind, and
were lo&s;t again, recalled to her memory
the melancholy &s;en&s;ations &s;he had &s;uffered,
when &s;he formerly heard the &s;ame &s;ounds;
and occa&s;ioned almo&s;t involuntary com|pari&s;ons
<PB N="266" REF="268">
between her pre&s;ent, and her late
&s;ituation. But this was no &s;ubject for con|gratulation,
and &s;he wi&s;ely checked the
courfe of her thoughts, while, as the hour
was not yet come, in which &s;he had been
accu&s;tomed to hear the rnu&s;ic, &s;he clo&s;ed
the ca&s;ement, and endeavoured to await it
in patience. The door of the &s;tair-ca&s;e
&s;he tried to &s;ecure, as u&s;ual, with &s;ome
of the furniture of the room; but this ex|pedient
her fears now repre&s;ented to her to
be very inadequate to the power and per|&s;everance
of Verezzi; and &s;he often looked
at a large and heavy che&s;t, that &s;tood in
the chamber, with wi&s;hes that &s;he andAn|nette
had &s;trength enough to move it.
While &s;he blamed the long &s;tay of this
girl, who was &s;till with Ludovico and &s;ome
other of the &s;ervants, &s;he trimmed her
wood fire, to make the room appear le&s;s
de&s;olate, and &s;at down be&s;ide it with a
book, which her eyes peru&s;ed, while her
thoughts wandered to Valancourt, and her
own misfortunes. As &s;he &s;at thus, &s;he
<PB N="267" REF="269">
thought, in a pau&s;e of the wind, &s;he di&s;|tingui&s;hed
mu&s;ic, and went to the ca&s;e|ment
to li&s;ten, but the loud &s;well of the
gu&s;t overcame every other &s;ound. When
the wind &s;unk again, &s;he heard di&s;tinctly,
in the deep pau&s;e that &s;ucceeded, the
&s;weet &s;trings of a lute; but again the ri&s;ing
tempe&s;t bore away the notes, and again
was &s;ucceeded by a &s;olemn pau&s;e. Emily,
trembling with hope and fear, opened her
ca&s;ement to li&s;ten, and to try whether her
own voice could be heard by the mu&s;ician;
for to endure any longer this &s;tate of tor|turing
&s;u&s;pen&s;e concerning Valancourt,
&s;eemed to be utterly impo&s;&s;ible. There
was a kind of breathle&s;s &s;tillne&s;s in the
chambers, that permitted her to di&s;tingui&s;h
from below the tender notes of the very
lute &s;he had formerly heard, and with it,
a plaintive voice, made &s;weeter by the low
ru&s;tling &s;ound, that now began to creep
along the wood-tops, till it was lo&s;t in the
ri&s;ing wind. Their tall heads then began
to wave, while, through a fore&s;t of pine,
<PB N="268" REF="270">
On the left, the wind, groaning heavily,
rolled onward over the woods below, bend|ing
them almo&s;t to their roots; and, as
the long-re&s;ounding gale &s;wept away,
other woods, on the right, feemed to an|&s;wer
the &startq;loud lament;&endq; then, others,
further &s;till, &s;oftened it into a murmur,
that died into &s;ilence. Emily li&s;tened, with
mingled awe and expectation, hope and
fear; and again the melting &s;weetne&s;s of
the lute was heard, and the &s;ame &s;olemn|breathing
voice. Convinced that the&s;e
came from an apartment underneath, &s;he
leaned far out of her window, that &s;he
might di&s;cover whether any light was
there; but the ca&s;ements below, as well
as tho&s;e above, were &s;unk &s;o deep in the
thick walls of the ca&s;tle, that &s;he could
not &s;ee them, or even the faint ray, that
probably glimmered through their bars.
She then ventured to call; but the wind
bore her voice to the other end of the
terrace, and then the mu&s;ic was heard as
before, in the pau&s;e of the gu&s;t. Suddenly,
<PB N="269" REF="271">
&s;he thought &s;he heard a noi&s;e in her cham|ber,
and &s;he drew her&s;elf within the ca&s;ement;
but, in a moment after, di&s;tingui&s;h|ing
Annette's voice at the door, &s;he con|cluded
it was her &s;he had heard before,
and &s;he let her in. &startq;Move &s;oftly, An|nette,
to the ca&s;ement,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &startq;and
li&s;ten with me; the mu&s;ic is returned.&endq;
They were &s;ilent till, the, mea&s;ure chang|ing,
Annette exclaimed, &startq;Holy Virgin!
I know that &s;ong well; it is a French
&s;ong, one of the &s;avourite &s;ongs of my dear
country.&endq; This was the ballad Emily had
heard on a former night, thought not the
one &s;he had fir&s;t li&s;tened to from the fi&s;h|ing-hou&s;e
in Ga&s;cony. &startq;O! it is a
Frenchman, that &s;ings,&endq; &s;aid Annette: &startq;it
mu&s;t be Mon&s;ieur Valancourt.&endq; &startq;Hark!
Annette, do not &s;peak &s;o loud,&endq; &s;aid
Emily, &startq;we may be overheard,&endq; &startq;What!
by the Chevalier?&endq; &s;aid Annette. &startq;No,&endq;
replied Emily mournfully, &startq;but by &s;ome|body,
who may report us to the Signor.
What rea&s;on have you to think it is Mon&s;ieur
<PB N="270" REF="272">
Valancourt, who &s;ings? But hark!
now the voice &s;wells louder! Do you re|collect
tho&s;e tones? I fear to tru&s;t my
own judgment.&endq; &startq;I never happened to
hear the Chevalier &s;ing, Mademoi&s;elle,&endq;
replied Annette, who, as Emily was di&s;appointed
to perceive, had no &s;tronger
rea&s;on for concluding this to be Valan.
court, than that the mu&s;ician mu&s;t be a
Frenchman. Soon after, &s;he heard the
&s;ong of the fi&s;hing-hou&s;e, and di&s;tingui&s;hed
her own name, which was repeated &s;o di&s;|tinctly,
that Annette had heard it al&s;o.
She trembled, &s;unk, into a chair by the
window, and Annette called aloud, &startq;Mon|&s;ieur
Valancourt! Mon&s;ieur Valancourt&endq;
while Emily endeavoured to check her,
but &s;he repeated the call more loudly than
before, and the lute and the voice &s;udden|ly
&s;topped. Emily li&s;tened, for &s;ome time,
in a &s;tate of intolerable &s;u&s;pen&s;e; but, no
an&s;wer being returned, &startq;It does not &s;ig|nify,
mademoi&s;elle,&endq; &s;aid Annette; &startq;it is
the Chevalier, and I will &s;peak to him.&endq;
<PB N="271" REF="273">
&startq;No, Annette,&endq; &s;aid Emily, &startq;I think I
will &s;peak my&s;elf; if it is he, he will
know my voice, and &s;peak again.&endq; &startq;Who
is it,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &startq;that &s;ings at this late
hour?&endq;</P>
<P>A long &s;ilence en&s;ued, and, having re|peated
the que&s;tion, &s;he perceived &s;ome
faint accents, mingling in the bla&s;t, that
&s;wept by; but the &s;ounds were &s;o di&s;tant,
and pa&s;&s;ed &s;o &s;uddenly, that &s;he could
&s;carcely hear them, much le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;h
the words they uttered, or recogni&s;e the
voice. After another pau&s;e, Emily called
again; and again they heard a voice, but
as faintly as before; and they perceived,
that there were other circum&s;tances, be|&s;ides
the &s;trength, and direction of the
wind, to contend with; for the great depth,
at which the ca&s;ements were &s;ixed in the
ca&s;tle walls, contributed, &s;till more than
the di&s;tance, to prevent articulated &s;ounds
from being under&s;tood, though general
ones were ea&s;ily heard. Emily, however,
ventured to believe, from the circum&s;tance
<PB N="272" REF="274">
of her voice alone having been an&s;wered,
that the &s;tranger was Valancourt, as well
as that he knew her, and &s;he gave her&s;elf
up to &s;peechle&s;s joy. Annette, however,
was not &s;peechle&s;s.&mdash;She renewed her calls,
but received no an&s;wer; and Emily,
fearing, that a further attempt, which cer|tainly
was, at pre&s;ent, highly, dangerous,
might expo&s;e them to the guards of the
ca&s;tle, while it could not perhaps termi|nate
her &s;u&s;pen&s;e, in&s;i&s;ted on Annette's
dropping the enquiry for this night; though
&s;he determined her&s;elf to que&s;tion Ludo|vico,
on the &s;ubject, in the morning, more
urgently than &s;he had yet done. She was
now enabled to &s;ay, that the &s;tranger,
whom &s;he had formerly heard, was &s;till in
the ca&s;tle, and to direct Ludovico to that
part of it, in which he was confined.</P>
<P>Emily, attended by Annette, continued
at the ca&s;ement, for &s;ome time; but all re|mained
&s;till; they heard neither lute or
voice again, and Emily was now as much
oppre&s;&s;ed by anxious joy, as &s;he lately
<PB N="273" REF="275">
was by a &s;en&s;e of her misfortunes. With
ha&s;ty &s;teps &s;he paced the room, now half
calling on Valancourt's name, then &s;ud|denly
&s;topping, and now going to the
ca&s;ement and li&s;tening, where, however,
&s;he heard nothing but the&s;olemn waving
of the woods. Sometimes her impatience
to &s;peak to Ludovico prompted her to
&s;end Annette to call him; but a &s;en&s;e
of the impropriety of this at midnight re|&s;trained
her. Annette, meanwhile, as im|patient
as her mi&s;tre&s;s, went as often to
the ca&s;ement to li&s;ten, and returned almo&s;t
as much, di&s;appointed. She, at length,
mentioned Signor Verezzi, and her fear,
le&s;t he &s;hould enter the chamber by the
&s;tcairca&s;e door. &startq;But the night is now
almo&s;t pa&s;t, mademoi&s;elle.&endq; &s;aid &s;he, re|collecting
her&s;elf: &startq;there is the morning
light, beginning to peep over tho&s;e moun|tains
yonder in the ea&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily had forgotten, till this moment,
that &s;uch a per&s;on exi&s;ted as Verezzi, and
all the danger that had appeared to threaten
<PB N="274" REF="276">
her; but the mention of his name renewed
her alarm, and &s;he remembered the old
che&s;t, that &s;he had wi&s;hed to place again&s;t
the door, which &s;he now, with Annette,
attempted to move, but it was &s;o heavy,
that they could not lift it from the floor,
&startq;What is in this great old che&s;t, made|moi&s;elle,&endq;
&s;aid Annette, &startq;that makes it
&s;o weighty?&endq; Emily having replied, &startq;that
&s;he found it in the chamber, when &s;he fir&s;t
came to the ca&s;tle, and had never examined
it,&endq;&mdash;&startq;Then I will, ma'am&s;elle,&endq; &s;aid
Annette, and &s;he tried to lift the lid; but
this was held by a lock, for which &s;he had
no key, and which, indeed, appeared, from
its peculiar con&s;truction, to open with a
&s;pring. The morning now glimmered
through the ca&s;ements, and the wind had
&s;unk into a calm. Emily looked out upon
the du&s;ky woods, and on the twilight
mountains, ju&s;t &s;tealing on the eye, and
&s;aw the whole &s;cene, after the &s;torm, lying
in profound &s;tillne&s;s, the woods motion|e&s;s,
and the clouds above, through which
<PB N="275" REF="277">
the dawn trembled, &s;carcely appearing to
move along the heavens. One &s;oldier was
pacing the terrace beneath, with mea&s;ured
&s;teps; and two, more di&s;tant, were &s;unk
a&s;leep on the walls, wearied with the
night's watch. Having inhaled, for a
while, the pure &s;pirit of the air, and of
vegetation, which the late rains had called
forth; and having li&s;tened, once more,
for a note of mu&s;ic, &s;he now clo&s;ed the
ca&s;ement, and retired to re&s;t.</P>

<P>SEVERAL of her &s;ucceeding days pa&s;&s;ed
in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, for Ludovico could only learn
from the &s;oldiers, that there was a pri&s;oner
in the apartment, de&s;cribed to him by
Emily, and that he was a Frenchman,
whom they had taken in one of their &s;kir|mi&s;hes,
with a party of his countrymen.
During this interval, Emily e&s;caped the
per&s;ecutions of Bertolini, and Verezizi, by
confining her&s;elf to her apartment; except
that &s;omething, in an evening, &s;he ven|tured
<PB N="277" REF="279">
to walk, in the adjoining corridor.
Montoni appeared to re&s;pect his la&s;t pro|mi&s;e,
though he had prophaned his fir&s;t;
for to his protection only could &s;he attri|bute
her pre&s;ent repo&s;e; and in this &s;he
was now &s;o &s;ecure, that &s;he did not wi&s;h to
leave the ca&s;tle, till &s;he could obtain &s;ome
certainty concerning Valancourt; for which
&s;he waited, indeed, without any &s;acrifice of
her own comfort, &s;ince no circum&s;tance
had occurred to make her e&s;cape pro|bable.</P>
<P>On the fourth day, Ludovico informed
her, that he had hopes of being admitted to
the pre&s;ence of the pri&s;oner; it being the
turn of a &s;oldier, with whom he had been
for &s;ome time familiar, to attend him on
the following night. He was not deceived
in his hope; for, under pretence of car|rying
in a pitcher of water, he entered the
pri&s;on, though, his prudence having pre|vented
him from telling the &s;entinel the
real motive of his vi&s;it, he was obliged to
<PB N="278" REF="280">
make his conference with the pri&s;oner a
very &s;hort One.</P>
<P>Emily awaited the re&s;ult in her own
apartment, Ludovico having promi&s;ed to
accompany Annette to the corridor, in the
evening; where, after &s;everal hours impa|tiently
counted, he arrived. Emily, having
then uttered the name of Valancourt, could
articulate no more, but he&s;itated in trem|bling
expectation. &startq;The Chevalier would
not entru&s;t me with his name, Signora,&endq;
replied Ludovico; &startq;but, when I ju&s;t
mentioned yours, he &s;eemed overwhelmed
with joy, though he was not &s;o much &s;ur|pri&s;ed
as I expected.&endq; &startq;Does he then
remember me?&endq; &s;he exclaimed.</P>
<P>&startq;O! it is Mon&s; Valancourt,&endq; &s;aid Annette,
and looked impatiently at Ludovico, who
under&s;tood her look, and replied to Emily:
&startq;Yes, lady, the Chevalier does, indeed, re|member
you, and, I am &s;ure, has a very
great regard for you, and I made bold to
&s;ay you had for him. He then enquired
<PB N="279" REF="281">
how you came to know he was in the ca&s;tle,
and whether you ordered me to &s;peak to him.
The fir&s;t que&s;tion 1 could not an&s;wer, but
the &s;econd I did; and then he went off into
his ec&s;ta&s;ies again. I was afraid his joy
would have betrayed him to the &s;entinel
at the door.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But how does he look, Luclovico?&endq; in|terrupted
Emily:&endq; is he not melancholy
and ill with this long confinement?&endq;&mdash;
&startq;Why, as to melancholy, I &s;aw no &s;ymp|tom
of that, lady, while I was with him,
for he &s;eemed in the fine&s;t &s;pirits I ever
&s;aw any body in, in all my life. His
countenance was all joy, and, if one may
judge from that, he was very-well; but
I did not a&s;k him.&endq; &startq;Did he &s;end me
no me&s;&s;age?&endq; &s;aid Emily. &startq;O yes, Sig|nora,
and &s;omething be&s;ides,&endq; replied Lu|dovico,
who &s;earched his pockets. &startq;Sure|ly,
I have not lo&s;t it,&endq; added he. &startq;The
Chevalier &s;aid, he would have written, ma|dam,
if he had had pen and ink; and was
going to have &s;ent a very long me&s;&s;age,
<PB N="280" REF="282">
when the &s;entinel entered the room, but
not before he had given me this.&endq; Lu|dovico
then drew forth a miniature from
his bo&s;om, which Emily received with a
trembling hand, and perceived to be a
portrait of her&s;elf&mdash;the very picture, which
her mother had lo&s;t &s;o &s;trangely in the
fi&s;hing-hou&s;e at La Vall$e.</P>
<P>Tears of mingled joy and tenderne&s;s
flowed to her eyes, while Ludovico pro|ceeded&mdash;&startq;Tell
your lady, &s;aid the
Chevalier, as he gave me the picture, that
this has been my companion, and only &s;o|lace
in all my misfortunes. Tell her, that
I have worn it next my heart, and that I
&s;end it her as the pledge of an affection,
which can never die; that I would not
part with it, but to her, for the wealth of
worlds, and that I now part with it, only
in the hope of &s;oon receiving it from her
hands. Tell her'&mdash;Ju&s;t then, Signora,
the &s;entinel came in, and the Chevalier
&s;aid no more; but he had before a&s;ked
me to contrive an interview for him with
<PB N="281" REF="283">
you; and when I told him, how little hope
I had of prevailing with the guard to a&s;&s;i&s;t
me, he &s;aid, that was not, perhaps, of
&s;o much con&s;equence as I imagined, and
bade me contrive to bring back your an|&s;wer,
and he would inform me of more
than he cho&s;e to do then. So this, I think,
lady, is the whole of what pa&s;&s;ed.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How, Ludovico, &s;hall I reward you
for your zeal' &startq;&s;aid Emily:&endq; but, in|deed,
I do not now po&s;&s;e&s;s the means.
When can you &s;ee the Chevalier again?&endq;
&startq;That is uncertain, Signora,&endq; replied he.
&startq;It depends upon who &s;tands guard next:
there are not more than one or two among
them, from whom I would dare to a&s;k ad|mittance
to the pri&s;on-chamber.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I need not bid you remember, Lu|dovico,&endq;
re&s;umed Emily, &startq;how very
much intere&s;ted I am in your &s;eeing the
Chevalier &s;oon; and, when you do &s;o, tell
him, that I have received the picture, and,
with the &s;entiments he wi&s;hed. Tell him
I have &s;uffered much, and &s;till fuffer&endq;&mdash;
<PB N="282" REF="284">
She pau&s;ed. &startq;But &s;hall I tell him you
will &s;ee him, lady?&endq; &s;aid Ludovico.
&startq;Mo&s;t certainly I will,&endq; replied Emily.
&startq;But when, Signora, and where?&endq; &startq;That
mu&s;t depend upon circum&s;tances,&endq; return|ed
Emily. &startq;The place, and the hour,
mu&s;t be regulated$ by his opportunities.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As to the place, mademoi&s;elle,&endq; &s;aid
Annette, &startq;there is no other place in the
ca&s;tle, be&s;ides this corridor, where <HI>we</HI> can
&s;ee him in &s;afety, you know; and, as for
the hour,&mdash;it mu&s;t be when all the Signors
are a&s;leep, if that ever happens!&endq; &startq;You
may mention the&s;e circum&s;tances to the
Chevalier, Ludovico,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, checking
the flippancy of Annette, &startq;and leave them
to his judgment and opportunity. Tell
him, my heart is unchanged. But, above
all, let him &s;ee you again as &s;oon as po&s;|&s;ible; and, Ludovico, 1 think it is need|le&s;s
to tell you 1 &s;hall very anxiou&s;ly look
for you.&endq; Having then wi&s;hed her good
night, Ludovico de&s;cended the &s;tairca&s;e,
and Emily retired to re&s;t, but not to &s;leep,
<PB N="283" REF="285">
for joy now rendered her as wakeful, as &s;he
had ever been from grief. Montoni and
his ca&s;tle had all vani&s;hed from her mind,
like the frightful vi&s;ion of a necromancer,
and &s;he wandered, once more, in fairy
&s;cenes of unfading happine&s;s:
<Q><L>&mdash;&startq;As when, beneath the beam</L>
<L>Of &s;ummer moons, the di&s;tant woods among,</L>
<L>Or by &s;ome flood, all &s;ilver'd with the gleam,</L>
<L>The &s;oft embodied Fay$ thro' airy portals &s;tream,&endq;</L></Q></P>
<P>A week elap&s;ed, before Ludovico again
vi&s;ited the pri&s;on; for the &s;entinels, during
that period, were men, in whom he could
not confide, and he feared to awaken cu|rio&s;ity,
by a&s;king to &s;ee their pri&s;oner. In
this interval, he communicated to Emily
terrific reports of what was pa&s;&s;ing in the
ca&s;tle; of riots, quarrels, and of carou&s;als
more alarming than either; while from
&s;ome circum&s;tances, which he mentioned,
&s;he not only doubted, whether Montoni
meant ever to relea&s;e her, but greatly
feared, that he had de&s;igns, concerning
<PB N="284" REF="286">
her,&mdash;&s;uch as &s;he had formerly dreaded.
Her name was frequently mentioned in the
conver&s;ations, which Bertolini and Verezzi
held together, and, at tho&s;e times, they
were frequently in contention. Montoni
had lo&s;t large &s;ums to Verezzi, &s;o that
there was a dreadful po&s;&s;ibility of his de&s;igning
her to be a &s;ub&s;titute for the debt;
but, as &s;he was ignorant, that he had for|merly
encouraged the hopes of Bertolini
al&s;o, concerning her&s;elf, after the latter
had done him &s;ome &s;ignal &s;ervice, &s;he knew
not how to account for the&s;e contentions
between Bertolini and Verezzi. The cau&s;e
of them, however, appeared to be of little
con&s;equence, for &s;he thought &s;he &s;aw de|&s;truction
approaching; in many forms, and
her entreaties to Ludovico to contrive an
E&s;cape and to &s;ee the pri&s;oner again, were
more urgent than ever.</P>
<P>At length, he informed her, that he had
again vi&s;i$ed the Chevalier, who had di|rected
him to confide in the guard of the
pri&s;on, from whom he had already re|ceived
<PB N="285" REF="287">
&s;ome in&s;tances of kindne&s;s, and
who had promi&s;ed to permit his going into
the ca&s;tle for half an hour, on the en|&s;uing
night, when Montoni and his com|panions
&s;hould be engaged at their carou|&s;als.
&startq;This was kind, to be &s;ure,&endq; added
Ludovico: &startq;but Seba&s;tian knows he runs
no ri&s;que in letting the Chevalier out, for,
if he can get beyond the bars and iron
doors of the ca&s;tle, he mu&s;t be cunning
indeed. But the Chevalier de&s;ired me,
Signora, to go to you immediately, and
to beg you would allow him to vi&s;it you,
this night, if it was only for a moment,
for that he could no longer live under the
&s;ame roof, without &s;eeing you; the hour,
he &s;ald, he could not mention, for it mu&s;t
depend on circum&s;tances (ju&s;t as you &s;aid,
Signora); and the place he de&s;ired you
would appoint, as knowing which was be&s;t
for your own &s;afety.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily was now &s;o much agitated by the
near pro&s;pect of meeting Valancourt, that
it was &s;ome time, before &s;he could give
<PB N="286" REF="288">
any an&s;wer to Ludovico, or con&s;ider of the
place of meeting; when &s;he did, &s;he &s;aw
none, that promi&s;ed &s;o much &s;ecurity, as
the corridor, near her own apartment,
which &s;he was checked from leaving, by
the apprehen&s;ion of meeting any of Mon|toni's
gue&s;ts, on their way to their rooms;
and &s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the &s;cruples, which deli|cacy
oppo&s;ed, now that a &s;erious danger
was to be avoided by encountering them.
It was &s;ettled, therefore, that the Cheva|lier
&s;hould meet her in the corridor, at
that hour of the night, which Ludovico,
who was to be upon the watch, &s;hould
judge &s;afe&s;t: and Emily, as may be ima|gined,
pa&s;&s;ed this interval in a tumult of
hope and joy, anxiety and impatience.
Never, &s;ince her re&s;idence in the ca&s;tle,
had &s;he watched, with &s;o much plea&s;ure,
the &s;un &s;et behind the mountains, and twilight
&s;hade, and darkne&s;s veil the &s;ccne,
as on this evening. She counted the notes
of the great clock, and li&s;tened to the &s;teps
of the &s;entinels, as they changed the watch,
<PB N="287" REF="289">
only to rejoice, that another hour was gone.
&startq;O, Valancourt!&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &startq;after all I
have &s;uffered; after our long, long &s;epa|ration,
when I thought I &s;hould never&mdash;
never &s;ee you more&mdash;we are &s;till to meet
again! O! I have endured grief, and
anxiety, and terror, and let me, then, not
&s;ink beneath this joy!&endq; The&s;e were mo|ments,
when it was impo&s;&s;ible for her to
feel emotions of regret, or melancholy, for
any ordinary intere&s;ts;&mdash;even the reflec|tion,
that &s;he had re&s;igned the e&s;tates, which
would have been a provi&s;ion for her&s;elf
and Valancourt for life, threw only a light
and tran&s;ient &s;hade upon her &s;pirits. The
idea of Valancourt, and that &s;he &s;hould &s;ee
him &s;o &s;oon, alone occupied her heart.</P>
<P>At length the clock &s;truck twelve; &s;he
opened the door to li&s;ten, if any noi&s;e was
in the ca&s;tle, and heard only di&s;tant &s;houts
of riot and laughter, echoed feebly along
the gallery. She gue&s;&s;ed, that the Signor
and his gue&s;ts were at the banquet. &startq;They
are now engaged for the night,&endq; &s;aid &s;he
<PB N="288" REF="290">
and Valancourt will &s;oon be here.&endq;
Having &s;oftly clo&s;ed the door, &s;he paced
the room with impatient &s;teps, and often
went to the ca&s;ement to li&s;ten for the lute;
but all was &s;ilent, and, her agitation every
moment increa&s;ing, &s;he was at length
unable to &s;upport her&s;elf, and &s;at down
by the window. Annette, whom &s;he de|tained,
was, in the meantime, as loquacious
as u&s;ual; but Emily heard &s;carcely any
thing &s;he &s;aid, and having at length ri&s;en to
the ca&s;ement, &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed the chords
of the lute, &s;truck with an expre&s;&s;ive hand,
and then the voice, &s;he had formerly li&s;tened
to, accompanied it.
<Q><L>&startq;Now ri&s;ing love they fann'd, now plea&s;ing dole</L>
<L>They breath'd in tender mu&s;ings through the heart;</L>
<L>And now a graver, &s;acred &s;train they &s;tole,</L>
<L>As when &s;eraphic hands an hymn impart!&endq;</L></Q></P>
<P>Emily wept in doubtful joy and tender|ne&s;s;
and, when the &s;train cea&s;ed &s;he con|&s;idered
it as a &s;ignal, that Valancourt was
about to leave the pri&s;on. Soon after, &s;he
<PB N="289" REF="291">
heard &s;teps in the corridor;&mdash;they were
the light, quick &s;teps of hope; &s;he could
&s;carcely &s;upport her&s;elf, as they approach|ed,
but opening the door of the apart|ment,
&s;he advanced to meet Valancourt,
and, in the next moment, &s;unk in the
arms of a&s;tranger. His voice&mdash;his coun|tenance
in&s;tantly convinced her, and &s;he
fainted away.</P>
<P>On reviving, &s;he found her&s;elf &s;upport|ed
by the &s;tranger, who was watching over
her recovery, with a countenance of inef|fable
tenderne&s;s and anxiety. She had no
&s;pirits for reply, or enquiry; &s;he a&s;ked no
que&s;tions, but bur&s;t into tears, and di&s;engaged
herfelf from his arms; when the ex|pre&s;&s;ion
of his countenance changed to &s;ur|pri&s;e
and di&s;appointment, and he turned
to Ludovico, for an explanation; Annette
&s;oon gave the information, which Ludo|vico
could not. &startq;O, &s;ir!&endq; &s;aid &s;he, in a
voice, interrupted with &s;obs; &startq;O, &s;ir!
you are not the other Chevalier. We ex|pccted
Mon$ieur Valancourt, but you are
<PB N="290" REF="292">
not he! O Ludovico! how could you de|ceive
us &s;o? my poor lady will never re|cover
it&mdash;never!&endq; The &s;tranger, who now
appeared much agitated, attempted to
&s;peak, but his words faltered; and then
&s;triking his hand again&s;t his forehead, as
if in &s;udden de&s;pair, he walked abruptly
to the other end of the corridor.</P>
<P>Suddenly, Annette dried her tears, and
&s;poke to Ludovico. &startq;But, perhaps,&endq;
&s;aid &s;he, &startq;after all, the other Chevalier is
not this: perhaps the Chevalier Valan|court
is &s;till below.&endq; Emily rai&s;ed her
head. &startq;No,&endq; replied Ludovico, &startq;Mon|&s;ieur
Valancourt never was below, if this
gentleman is not he.&endq; &startq;If you, &s;ir,&endq;
&s;aid Ludovico, addre&s;&s;ing the &s;tranger,
would but have had the goodne&s;s to tru&s;t
me with your name, this mi&s;take had been
avoided.&endq; &startq;Mo&s;t true,&endq; replied the &s;tran|ger,
&s;peaking in broken Italian, &startq;but
it was of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to me,
that my name &s;hould be concealed from
Montoni. Madam,&endq; added he then, addre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="291" REF="293">
Emily in French, &startq;will you per|mit
me to apologize for the pain I have
occa&s;ioned you, and to explain to you
alone my name, and the circum&s;tance,
which has led me into this error? I am of
France;&mdash;I am your countryman;&mdash;we
are met in a foreign land.&endq; Emily tried
to compo&s;e her &s;pirits; yet &s;he he&s;itated to
grant his reque&s;t. At length, de&s;iring,
that Ludovico would wait on the &s;tair-ca&s;e,
and detaining Annette, &s;he told the
&s;tranger, that her woman under&s;tood very
little Italian, and begged he would
com|municate
what he wi&s;hed to &s;ay, in that
language.&mdash;Having withdrawn to a di&s;tant
part of the corridor, he &s;aid, with a long|drawn
&s;igh, &startq;You, madam, are no &s;tranger
to me, though I am &s;o unhappy as to be
unknown to you.&mdash;My name is Du Pont;
I am of France, of Ga&s;cony, your native
province, and have long admired,&mdash;and,
why &s;hould I affect to di&s;gui&s;e it?&mdash;have
long loved you.&endq; He pau&s;ed, but, in the
next moment, proceeded. &startq;My family,
<PB N="292" REF="294">
madam, is probably not unknown to you,
for we lived within a few miles of L$
Vall$e, and I have, &s;ometimes, had the
happine&s;s of meeting you, on vi&s;its in
the neighbourhood. I will not offend you
by repeating how much you intere&s;ted me;
how much I loved to wander in the &s;cenes
you frequented; how often I vi&s;ited your
favourite fi&s;hing-hou&s;e, and lamented the
circum&s;tance, which, at that time, for|bade
me to reveal my pa&s;&s;ion. I will not
explain how I &s;urrendered to temptation,
and became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a trea&s;ure, which
was to me ine&s;timable; a trea&s;ure, which
I committed to your me&s;&s;enger, a few days
ago, with expectations very different from
my pre&s;ent ones. I will &s;ay nothing of
the&s;e circum&s;tances, for I know they will
avail me little; let me only &s;upplicate from
you forgivene&s;s, and the picture, which I
&s;o unwarily returned. Your genero&s;ity
will pardon the theft, and re&s;tore the
prize. My crime has been my puni&s;h|ment;
for the portrait I &s;tole has contri|buted
<PB N="293" REF="295">
to nouri&s;h a pa&s;&s;ion, which mu&s;t &s;till
be my torment.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily now interrupted him. &startq;I think,
&s;ir, I may leave it to your integrity to de|termine,
whether, after what has ju&s;t ap|peared,
concerning mon&s;. Valancourt, I
ought to return the picture. I think you
will acknowledge, that this would not be
genero&s;ity; and you will allow me to add,
that it would be doing my&s;elf an inju&s;tice.
I mu&s;t con&s;ider my&s;elf honoured by your
good opinion, but&mdash;and &s;he he&s;itated,
&mdash;&startq;the mi&s;take of this evening makes it
unnece&s;&s;ary for me to &s;ay more.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It does, madam,&mdash;alas! it does!&endq;
&s;aid the &s;tranger, who, after a long pau&s;e,
proceeded.&mdash;&startq;But you will allow me to
&s;hew my di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, though not my
love, and will accept the &s;ervices I offer.
Yet, alas $ what &s;ervices can. I offer? I am
myfelf a pri&s;oner, a &s;ufferer, like you. But,
dear as liberty is to me, I would not &s;eek
it through half the hazards I would en|counter
to deliver you from this rece&s;s of
<PB N="294" REF="296">
vice. Accept the offered &s;ervlces of a
friend; do not refu&s;e me the reward of
having, at lea$t, attempted to de&s;erve your
thanks.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You de&s;erve them already, &s;ir,&endq; &s;aid
Emily; &startq;the wi&s;h de&s;erves my warme&s;t
thanks. But you will excu&s;e me for re|minding
you of the danger you incur by
prolonging this interview. It will be a
great con&s;olation to me to remember, whe|ther
your friendly attempts to relea&s;e me
&s;ucceed or not, that 1 have a countryman,
who would &s;o generou&s;ly protect me.&endq;&mdash;
Mon&s;ieur Du Pont took her hand, which
&s;he but feebly attempted to withdraw, and
pre&s;&s;ed it re&s;pectfully to his lips. &startq;Al|low
me to breathe another &s;ervent &s;igh for
your happine&s;s,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;and to ap|plaud
my&s;elf for an affection, which 1 can|not
conquer.&endq; As he &s;aid this, Emily
heard a noi&s;e from her apartment, and,
turning round, &s;aw the door from the &s;tair-ca&s;e
open, and a man ru&s;h into her cham|ber,
&startq;I will teach you to conquer it,&endq;
<PB N="295" REF="297">
cried he, as he advanced into the corridor,
and drew a &s;tiletco, which he aimed at
Do Pont, who was unarmed, but who,
&s;tepping back, avoided the blow, and
then &s;prung upon Verezzi, from whom
he wrenched the &s;tiletto. While they
&s;truggled in each other's gra&s;p, Emily,
followed by Annette, ran further into the
corridor, calling on Ludovico, who was,
however, gone from the &s;tair-ca&s;e, and, as
&s;he advanced, terrified and uncertain what
to do, a di&s;tant noi&s;e, that &s;eemed to ari&s;e
from the hall, reminded her of the danger
&s;he was incurring; and, &s;ending Annette
forward in &s;earch of Ludovico, &s;he re|turned
to the &s;pot where Du Pont and
Verezzi were &s;till &s;truggling for victory.
It was her own cau&s;e which was to be
decided with that of the former, who&s;e
conduct, independently of this circum&s;tance,
would, however, have intere&s;ted her in his
&s;ucce&s;s, even had &s;he not di&s;liked and
dreaded Verezzi. She threw her&s;elf in a
chair, and &s;upplicated them to de&s;i&s;t from
<PB N="296" REF="298">
further violence, till, at length, Du Pont
forced Verezzi to the floor, where he lay
&s;tunned by the violence of his fall; and
&s;he then entreated Du Pont to e&s;cape from
the room, before Montoni, or his party,
&s;bould appear; but he &s;till refu&s;ed to leave
her unprotected; and, while Emily, now
more terrified for him, than for her&s;elf,
enforced the entreaty, they heard &s;teps
a&s;cending the private &s;tair-ca&s;e.</P>
<P>&startq;O you ard lo&s;t!&endq; cried &s;he, &startq;the&s;e
are Montoni's people.&endq; Du Pont made
no reply, but &s;upported Emily, while, with
a &s;teady, though eager, countenance, he
awaited their appearance, and, in the next
moment, Ludovico, alone, mounted the
landing-place. Throwing an ha&s;ty glance
round the chamber, &startq;Follow me,&endq; &s;aid
he, &startq;as you value your lives; we have
not an in&s;tant to lo&s;e!&endq;</P>
<P>Emily enquired what had occurred, and
whither they were to go?</P>
<P>&startq;I cannot &s;tay to tell you now, Sig|nora;&endq;
replied Ludovico: &startq;fly! fly!&endq;
<PB N="297" REF="299">
She immediately followed him, accom|panied
by Mon&s; Du Pont, down the &s;tair-ca&s;e,
and along a vaulted pa&s;&s;age, when
&s;uddenly &s;he recollected Annette, and en|quired
for her. &startq;She awaits us further
on, Signora,&endq; faid Ludovico, almo&s;t
breathle&s;s with ha&s;te; &startq;the gates were
open, a moment &s;ince, to a party ju&s;t come
in from the mountains: they will be &s;hut,
I fear, before we can reach them! Through
this door, Signora,&endq; added Ludovico, hold|ing
down the lamp, &startq;take care, here are
two &s;teps.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily followed, trembling &s;till more, than
before &s;he had under&s;tood, that her e&s;cape
from the ca&s;tle depended upon the pre&s;ent
moment; while Du Pont &s;upported her,
and endeavoured, as they pa&s;&s;ed along, to
cheer her &s;pirits.</P>
<P>&startq;Speak low, Signor,&endq; &s;aid Ludovico,
the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages &s;end echoes all round the
ca&s;tle.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Take care of the light, cried Emily,
<PB N="298" REF="300">
you go &s;o fa&s;t, that the air will extin|gui&s;h
it.&endq;</P>
<P>Ludovico now opened another door,
where they found Annette, and the party
then de&s;cended a &s;hort flight of &s;teps into
a pa&s;&s;age, which, Ludovico &s;aid, led round
the inner court of the ca&s;tle, and opened
into the outer one. As they advanced,
confu&s;ed and tumultuous &s;ounds, that
&s;eemed to come from the inner court,
alarmed Emily. &startq;Nay, Signora,&endq; &s;aid
Ludovico, &startq;our only hope is in that tu|mult;
while the Signer's people are bu&s;ied
about the men, who are ju&s;t arrived, we
may, perhaps, pa&s;s unnoticed through the
gates. But hu&s;h!&endq; he added, as they
approached the &s;mall door, that opened
into the outer court, &startq;if you will remain
here a moment, I will go to &s;ee whether the
gates are open, and any body is in the way.
Pray extingui&s;h the light, Signor, if you
hear me talking,&endq; continued Ludovico,
delivering the lamp to Du Pont,&endq; and
remain quite &s;till.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="301">
Saying this, he &s;tepped out upon the
court, and they clo&s;ed the door, li&s;tening
anxiou&s;ly to his departing &s;teps. No voice,
however, was heard in the court, which he
was cro&s;&s;ing, though a confu&s;ion. of many
voices yet i&s;&s;ued from the inner one. &startq;We
&s;hall &s;oon be beyond the walls,&startq;&s;aid Du
Pont &s;o&s;tly to Emily, &startq;&s;upport your&s;elf
a little longer, Madam, and all will be
well.&endq;</P>
<P>But &s;oon they heard Ludovico &s;peak|ing;
loud, and the voice al&s;o of &s;ome other
per&s;on, and Du Pont immediately extin|gui&s;hed
the lamp. &startq;Ah! it is too late!&endq;
exclaimed Emily, &startq;what is to become of
us?' They li&s;tened again, and then per|ceived,
that Ludovico was talking with a
&s;entinel, who&s;e voices were heard al&s;o by
Emily's favourite dog, that had followed
her from the chamber, and now barked
loudly. &startq;This dog will betray us!&endq;&s;aid
Du Pont, &startq;I will hold him.&startq;&startq;I fear
he has already betrayed us!&endq;replied
Emily. Du Pont, however, caught him
<PB N="300" REF="302">
up, and, again li&s;tening to what was going
on without, they heard Ludovico &s;ay,
&startq;I'll watch the gates the while.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Stay a minute,&endq;replied the &s;entinel,
&startq;and you need not have the trouble, for
the hor&s;es will be &s;ent round to the outer
&s;tables, then the gates will be &s;hut, and I
can leave my po&s;t.&endq;&startq;I don't mind the
trouble, comrade.&startq;&s;aid Ludovico, &startq;you
will do &s;uch another good turn for me,
&s;ome time. Go&mdash;go, and fetch the wine;
the rogues, that are ju&s;t come in, will
drink it all el&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;oldier he&s;itated, and then called
aloud to the people in the &s;econd court, to
know why they did not &s;end out the
hor&s;es, that the gates might be &s;hut; but
they were too much engaged, to attend to
him, even if they had heard his voice.</P>
<P>&startq;Aye&mdash;aye,&endq; &s;aid Ludovico, &startq;they
know better than that; they are &s;haring it
all among them; if you wait till the hor&s;es
come out, you mu&s;t wait till the wine is
drunk. I have had my &s;hare already, but,
<PB N="301" REF="303">
&s;ince you do not care about yours, I &s;ee
no rea&s;on why I &s;hould not have that too.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Hold, hold, not &s;o fa&s;t,&endq;cried the
&s;entinel, &startq;do watch then, for a moment; I'll be with you pre&s;ently.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Don't hurry your&s;elf,&endq;&s;aid Ludovico,
coolly, &startq;I have kept guard before now.
But you may leave me your<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">A kind of blunderbufs.</NOTE> trombone,
that, if the ca&s;tle &s;hould be attacked, you
know, I may be able to defend the pa&s;s
like a hero.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;There, my good fellow,&endq;returned the
&s;oldier, &startq;there, take it&mdash;it has &s;een &s;er|vice,
though it could do little in defend|ing
the ca&s;tle. I'll tell you a good &s;tory,
though, about this &s;ame trombone.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You'll tell it better when you have
had the wine,&endq;&s;aid Ludovico. &startq;There!
they are coming out from the court al|ready.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I'll have the wine, though,&endq;&s;aid the
&s;entinel, running off. &startq;I won't keep you
a minute.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="304">
&startq;Take your time, I am in no ha&s;te,&endq;
replied Ludovico, who was already hurry|ing
acro&s;s the court, when the &s;oldier came
back. &startq;Whither &s;o fa&s;t, friend&mdash;whither
&s;o fa&s;t?&endq;&s;aid the latter. &startq;What! is this
the way you keep watch? I mu&s;t &s;tand to
my po&s;t my&s;elf, I &s;ee.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Aye, well,&endq;replied Ludovico, &startq;you
have &s;aved me the trouble of following
you further, for I wanted to tell you, if
you have a mind to drink the Tu&s;cany
wine, you mu&s;t go to Seba$tian, he is deal|ing
it out; the other that Federico has, is
not worth having. But you are not likely
to have any, I &s;ee, for they are all coming
out.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;By St. Peter! &s;o they are,&endq;&s;aid the
&s;oldier, and again ran off, while Ludo|vico,
once more at liberty, ha&s;tened to the
door of the pa&s;&s;age, where Emily was &s;ink|ing
under the anxiety this long di&s;cour&s;e
had occa&s;ioned; but, on his telling them
the court was clear, they followed him to
the gates, without waiting another in&s;tant,
<PB N="303" REF="305">
yet not before he had &s;eized two hor&s;es,
that had &s;trayed from the &s;econd court,
and were picking a &s;canty meal among the
gra&s;s, which grew between the pavement
of the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>They pa&s;&s;ed, without interruption, the
dreadful gates, and took the road that led
down among the woods, Emily, Mon&s;ieur
Du Pont and Annette on foot, and Lu|dovico,
who was mounted on one hor&s;e,
leading the other. Having reached them,
they &s;topped, while Emily and Annette
were placed on hor&s;eback with their two
protectors, when, Ludovico leading the
way, they &s;et off as fa&s;t as the broken road,
and the feeble light, which a ri&s;ing moon
threw among the foliage, would permit.</P>
<P>Emily was &s;o much a&s;toni&s;hed by this
&s;udden departure, that &s;he &s;carcely dared
to believe her&s;elf awake; and &s;he yet much
doubted whether this adventure would ter|minate
in e&s;cape,&mdash;a doubt, which had too
much probability to ju&s;tify it; for, before
they quitted the woods, they heard &s;houts
<PB N="304" REF="306">
in the wind, and, on emerging from them,
&s;aw lights moving quickly near the ca&s;tle
above. Du Pont whipped his hor&s;e, and
with &s;ome difficulty compelled him to go
fa&s;ter.</P>
<P>&startq;Ah! poor bea&s;t,&endq;&s;aid Ludovico, &startq;he
is weary enough;&mdash;he has been out all
day; but, Signor, we mu&s;t fly for it, now;
for yonder are the lights coming this way.&endq;</P>
<P>Having given his own hor&s;e a la&s;h,
they now both &s;et off on a full gallop; and,
when they again looked back, the lights
were &s;o di&s;tant as &s;carcely to be di&s;cerned,
and the voices were &s;unk into &s;ilence. The
travellers then abated their pace, and, con|&s;ulting
whither they &s;hould direct their
cour&s;e, it was determined they &s;hould de|&s;cend into Tu&s;cany, and endeavour to
reach the Mediterranean, where they could
readily embark for France. Thither Du
Pont meant to attend Emily, if he &s;hould
learn, that the regiment he had accom|panied
into Italy, was returned to his na|tive
country.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="307">
They were now in the road, which Emily
had travelled with Ugo and Bertrand;
but Ludovico, who was the only one of
the party, acquainted with the pa&s;&s;es of
the&s;e mountains, &s;aid, that, a little further
on, a bye-road, branching from this, would
lead them down into Tu&s;cany with very
little difficulty; and that, at a few leagues
di&s;tance, was a &s;mall town, where nece&s;&s;a|ries
could be procured for their journey.</P>
<P>&startq;But, I hope,&endq;added he,&startq;we &s;hall
meet with no &s;traggling parties of banditti;
&s;ome of them are abroad, I know. How|ever,
I have got a good trombone, which
will be of &s;ome &s;ervice, if we should en|counter
any of tho&s;e brave &s;pirits. You
have no arms, Signor?&startq;&endq;Yes,&endq;replied
Du Pont, &startq;I have the villain's &s;tiletto,
who would have &s;tabbed me&mdash;but let us
rejoice in our e&s;cape from Udolpho, nor
torment our&s;elves with looking out for
dangers, that may neve$ arrive.&endq;</P>
<P>The moon was now ri&s;en high over the
woods, that hung upon the &s;ides of the
<PB N="306" REF="308">
narrow glen, through which they wander|ed,
and afforded them light &s;ufficient to di&s;|tingui&s;h
their way, and to avoid the loo&s;e
and broken &s;tones, that frequently cro&s;&s;ed
it. They now travelled lei&s;urely, and in
pro&s;ound &s;ilence; for they had &s;carcely yet
recovered from the a&s;toni&s;hment, into which
this &s;uddcn e&s;cape had thrown them.&mdash;
Emily's rnind, e&s;pecially, was &s;unk, after
the various emotions it had &s;uffered, into a
kind of mu&s;ing &s;tillne&s;s, which the repo&s;|ing
beauty of the &s;urrounding &s;cene and
the creeping murmur of the night-breeze
among the foliage above contributed to
prolong. She thought of Valancourt and
of France, with hope, and &s;he would have
thought of them with joy, had not the fir&s;t
events of this evening hara&s;&s;ed her &s;pirits
too much, to permit her now to feel &s;o
lively a &s;en&s;ation. Meanwhile, Emily was
alone the object of Du Pont's melancholy
consideration; yet, with the de&s;pondency
he &s;uffered, as he rnu&s;ed on his recent di&s;|appointment,
was mingled a &s;weet plea|&s;ure,
<PB N="307" REF="309">
occa&s;ioned by her pre&s;ence, though
they did not now exchange a &s;ingle word.
Annette thought of this wonderful e&s;cape,
of the bu&s;tle in which Montoni and his
people mu&s;t be, now that their &s;light was
di&s;covered; of her native country, whither
&s;he hoped &s;he was returning, and of her
marriage with Ludovico, to which there
no longer appeared any impediment, for
poverty &s;he did not con&s;ider &s;uch. Ludo|vico,
on his part, congratulated him&s;elf,
on having re&s;cued his Annette and <HI>Signor$</HI>
Emily from the danger, that had &s;urround|ed
them; on his own liberation from peo|ple,
who&s;e manners he had long dete&s;ted;
on the freedom he had given to Mo$&s;ieur
Du Pont; on his pro&s;pect of happine&s;s
with the object of his affections, and not a
little on the addre&s;s, with which he had de|ceived
the &s;entinel, and conducted the
whole of this affair.</P>
<P>Thus variou&s;ly engaged in thought, the
travellers pa&s;&s;ed on &s;ilently, for above an
hour, a que&s;tion only being, now and then,
<PB N="308" REF="310">
a&s;ked by Du Pont, concerning the road,
or a remark uttered by Annette, re&s;pect|ing
objects, &s;een imperfectly in the twi|light.
At length, lights were perceived
twinkling on the &s;ide of a mountain, and
Ludovico had no doubt, that they pro|ceeded
from the town he had mentioned,
while his companions, &s;atisfied by this
a&s;&s;urance, &s;unk again into &s;ilence. Annette
was the fir&s;t who interrupted this. &startq;Holy
Peter!&endq;&s;aid &s;he, &startq;What &s;hall we do
for money on our journey? for I know
neither I, or my lady, have a &s;ingle &s;equin;
the Signor took care of that!&endq;</P>
<P>This remark produced a &s;erious enquiry,
which ended in as &s;erious an embarra&s;&s;|ment,
for Du Pont had been rifled of
nearly all his money, when he was taken
pri&s;oner; the remainder he had given to
the &s;entinel, who had enabled him occa|sionally
to leave his pri&s;on-chamber;
and Ludovico, who had for &s;ome time found
a difficulty, in procuring any part of the
wages due to him, had now &s;carcely ca&s;h
<PB N="309" REF="311">
&s;ufficient to procure nece&s;&s;ary refreshment
at the fir&s;t town, in which they &s;hould ar|rive.</P>
<P>Their poverty was the more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing,
&s;ince it would detain them among the
mountains, where, even in a town, they
could &s;carcely con&s;ider them&s;elves &s;afe
from Montoni. The travellers, however,
had only to proceed and dare the future;
and they continued their way through
lonely wilds and du&s;ky vallies, where the
overhanging foliage now admitted, and
then excluded the moon-light;&mdash;wilds &s;o
de&s;olate, that they appeared, on the fir&s;t
glance, as if no human being had ever trode
them before. Even the road, in which the
party were, did but &s;lightly contradict this
error, for the high gra&s;s and other luxu|riant
vegetation, with which it was over|grown,
told how very &s;eldom the foot of a
traveller had pa&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P>At length, from a di&s;tance, was heard
the faint tinkling of a &s;heep-bell; and,
&s;oon after, the bleat of flocks, and the party
<PB N="310" REF="312">
then knew, that they were near &s;ome human
habitation, for the light, which Ludovico
had fancied to proceed from a town, had
long been concealed by intervening moun|tains.
Cheered by this hope, they quickened
their pace along the narrow pa&s;s they were
winding, and it opened upon one of tho&s;e
pa&s;toral vallies of the Apennines, which
might be painted for a &s;cene of Arcadia,
and who&s;e beauty and &s;implicity are finely
contra&s;ted by the grandeur of the &s;now-topt mountains above.</P>
<P>The morning light, now glimmering in
the horizon, &s;hewed faintly, at a little di&s;|tance,
upon the brow of a hill, which
&s;eemed to peep from &startq;under the opening
eye-lids of the morn,&endq;the town they were
in &s;earch of, and which they &s;oon after
reached. It was not without &s;ome diffi|culty,
that they there found a hou&s;e,
which could afford &s;helter for them&s;elves
and their hor&s;es; and Emily de&s;ired they
might not re&s;t longer than was ncce&s;&s;ary
for refre&s;hment. Her appearance excited
<PB N="311" REF="313">
&s;ome &s;urpri&s;e; for &s;he was without a hat,
having had time only to throw on her veil
before &s;he left the ca&s;tle, a circum&s;tance,
that compelled her to regret again the want
of money, without which it was impo&s;&s;ible
to procure this nece&s;&s;ary article of dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Ludovico, on examining his pur&s;e, found
it even in&s;ufficient to &s;upply pre&s;ent re|fre&s;hment,
and Du Pont, at length, ven|tured
to inform the landlord, whose coun|tenance
was &s;imple and hone&s;t, of their ex|act
&s;ituation, and reque&s;ted, that he would
a&s;&s;i&s;t them to pur&s;ue their journey; a pur|po&s;e,
which he promi&s;ed to comply with,
as far as he was able, when he learned that
they were pri&s;oners e&s;caping from Montoni,
whom he had too much rea&s;on to hate.
But, though he consented to lend them fre&s;h
hor&s;es to carry them to the next town, he
was too poor him&s;elf to tru&s;t them with
money, and they were again lamenting
their poverty, when Ludovico, who had
been with his tired hor&s;es to the hovel,
which &s;erved for a &s;table, entered the
<PB N="312" REF="314">
room, half frantic with joy, in which his
auditors &s;oon participated. On removing
the &s;addle from one of the hor&s;es, he had
found beneath it a &s;mall bag, containing,
no doubt, the booty of one of the <HI>condot|tieri,</HI>
who had returned from a plundering
excur&s;ion, ju&s;t before Ludovico left the
ca&s;tle, and who&s;e hor&s;e having &s;trayed
from the inner court, while his ma&s;ter was
engaged in drinking, had brought away
the trea&s;ure, which the ruffian had con|&s;idered
the reward of his exploit.</P>
<P>On counting over this, Du Pont found,
that it would be more than &s;ufficient to
carry them all to France, where he now
determined to accompany Emily,
whether he &s;hould obtain intelligence of his regi|ment,
or not; for, though he had as
much confidence in the integrity of Ludo|vico,
as his &s;mall knowledge of him al|lowed,
he could not endure the thought
of committing her to his care for the voy|age;
nor, perhaps, had he resolution
enough to deny him&s;elf the dangerous
<PB N="313" REF="315">
plea&s;ure, which he might derive from her
pre&s;ence</P>
<P>He now con&s;ulted them, concerning the
&s;ea-port, to which they &s;hould direct their
way, and Ludovico, better informed of the
geography of the country, &s;aid, that Leg|horn
was the neare&s;t port of con&s;equence,
which Du Pont knew al&s;o to be the mo&s;t
likely of any in Italy to a&s;&s;i&s;t their plan,
&s;ince from thence ve&s;&s;els of all nations
were continually departing. Thither, there|fore,
it was determined, that they &s;hould
proceed.</P>
<P>Emily, having purcha&s;ed a little &s;traw
hat, &s;uch as was worn by the pea&s;ant
girls of Tu&s;cany, and &s;ome other little
nece&s;&s;ary equipments for the journey, and
the travellers, having exchanged their tired
hor&s;es for others better able to carry them,
re-commenced their joyous way, as the
&s;un was ri&s;ing over the mountains, and,
after travelling through this romantic coun|try,
for &s;everal hours, began to de&s;cend
into the vale of Arno. And here Emily
<PB N="314" REF="316">
beheld all the charms of &s;ylvan and pa&s;to|ral
land&s;cape united, adorned with the ele|gant
villas of the Florentine nobles, and
diver&s;ified. with the various riches of cul|tivation.
How vivid the &s;hrubs, that em|bowered
the &s;lopes, with the woods, that
&s;tretched amphitheatrically along the moun|tains!
and, above all, how elegant the out|line
of the&s;e waving Apennines, now &s;oft|ening
from the wildne&s;s, which their interior
regions exhibited! At a di&s;tance, in the ea&s;t,
Emily di&s;covered Florence, with its towers
ri&s;ing on the brilliant horizon, and its lux|uriant
plain, &s;preading to the feet of the
Apennines, &s;peckled with gardens and magnificent
villas, or coloured with groves
of orange and lemon, with vines, corn,
and plantations of olives and mulberry;
while, to the we&s;t, the vale opened to the
waters of the Mediterranean, &s;o di&s;tant,
that they were known only by a bluei&s;h
line, that appeared upon the horizon, and
by the light marine vapour, which ju&s;t
&s;tained the aether above.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="317">
With a full heart, Emily hailed the
waves, that were to bear her back to her
native country, the remembrance of which,
however, brought with It a pang; for
&s;he had there no home to receive, no pa|rents
to welcome her, but was going, like
a forlorn pilgrim, to weep over the &s;ad
&s;pot, where he, who <HI>was</HI> her father, lay
interred. Nor were her &s;pirits cheered,
when &s;he con&s;idered how long It would
probably be before &s;he &s;hould &s;ee Valan|court,
who might be &s;tationed with his re|giment
in a di&s;tant part of France, and that,
when they did meet, it would be
only to lament the &s;ucce&s;sful villany of
Montoni; yet, &s;till &s;he would have felt in
expre&s;&s;ible delight at the thought of being
once more in the &s;ame country with Valan|court,
had it even been certain, that &s;he
could not &s;ee him.</P>
<P>The inten&s;e heat, for it was now noon,
obliged the travellers to look out for a
&s;hady rece&s;s, where they might re&s;t, for a
few hours, and the neighbouring thickets,
<PB N="316" REF="318">
abounding with wild grapes, ra&s;pberries,
and figs, promi&s;ed them grateful refre&s;h|ment.
Soon after, they turned from the
road into a grove, who&s;e thick foliage
entirely excluded the &s;un-beams, and
where a &s;pring, gu&s;hing from the rock,
gave coolne&s;s to the air; and, having
alighted and turned the hor&s;es to graze,
Annette and Ludovico ran to gather fruit
from the &s;urrounding thickets, of which
they &s;oon returned with an abundance. The
travellers, &s;eated under the &s;hade of a pine
and cypre&s;s grove and on turf, enriched
with &s;uch a profu&s;ion of fragrant flowers,
as Emily had &s;carcely ever &s;een, even
among the Pyreneacute;es, took their &s;imple
repa&s;t, and viewed, with new delight,
beneath the dark umbrage of gigantic
pines, the glowing land&s;cape &s;tretching
to the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Emily and Du Pont gradually became
thoughtful and &s;ilent; but Annette was all
joy and loquacity, aud Ludovico was gay,
without forgetting the re&s;pectful di&s;tance,
<PB N="317" REF="319">
which was due to his companions. The
repa&s;t being over, Du Pont recommend|ed
Emily to endeavour to &s;leep, during
the&s;e &s;ultry hours, and, de&s;iring the &s;er|vants
would do the &s;ame, &s;aid he would
watch the while; but Ludovico wi&s;hed
to &s;pare him this trouble; and Emily
and Annette, wearied with travelling, tried
to repo&s;e, while he &s;tood guard with his
trombone.</P>
<P>When Emily refre&s;hed by &s;lumber,
awoke, &s;he found, the &s;entinel a&s;leep on
his po&s;t and Du Pont awake, but lo&s;t in
melancholy thought. As the &s;un was yet
too high to allow them to continue their
journey, and as it was nece&s;&s;ary, that Lu|dovico
after the toils and trouble he had
&s;uffered, &s;hould fini&s;h his &s;leep, Emily
took this opportunity of enquiring by what
accident Du Pont became Montoni's pri|&s;oner,
and he, plea&s;ed with the intere&s;t
this enquiry expre&s;&s;ed and with the excu&s;e
it gave him for talking to her of him&s;elf,
immediately an&s;wered her curio&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="320">
&startq;I came into Italy, madam,&endq;&s;aid Du Pont,
&startq;In the &s;ervice of my country. In an
adventure among the mountains our party,
engaging with the bands of Montoni, was
routed, and I, with a few of my comrades,
was taken pri&s;oner. When they told me,
who&s;e captive I was, the name of Montoni
&s;truck me, for I remembered, that Madame
Cheron, your aunt, had married an Italian
of that name, and that you had accompa|nied
them into Italy. It was not, how|ever,
till &s;ome time after, that I became
convinced this was the &s;ame Montoni, or
learned that you, madam, was under the
&s;ame roof with my&s;elf. I will not pain
you by de&s;cribing what were my emotions
upon this di&s;covery, which I owed to a
&s;entinel, whom I had &s;o far won to my
intere&s;t, that he granted me many indul|gences,
one of which was very important
to me, and &s;omewhat dangerous to him|&s;elf;
but he per&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing to con|vey
any. letter, or notice of my &s;ituation
to you, for he ju&s;tly dreaded a di&s;co|very
<PB N="319" REF="321">
and the con&s;equent vengeance of
Montoni. He however enabled me to
&s;ee you more than once. You are &s;ur|pri&s;ed,
madam, and I will explain my|&s;elf.
My health and &s;pirits &s;uffered ex|tremely
from want of air and exerci&s;e, and,
at length, I gained &s;o far upon the pity, or
the avarice of the man, that he gave me
the means of walking on the terrace.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily now li&s;tened, with very anxious
attention, to the narrative of Du Pont, who
proceeded:</P>
<P>&startq;In granting this indulgence, he knew,
that he had nothing to apprehend from a
chance of my e&s;caping from a ca&s;tle, which
was vigilantly guarded, and the neare&s;t ter|race
of which ro&s;e over a perpendicular rock;
he &s;hewed me al&s;o,&endq;continued Du Pont,
&startq;a door concealed in the cedar wain&s;cot
of the apartment where I was confined,
which he inctru&s;ted me how to open;
and which, leading into a pa&s;&s;age, formed
within the thicken&s;s of the wall, that ex|tended
far along the ca&s;tle, finally opened
<PB N="320" REF="322">
in an ob&s;cure corner of the ea&s;tern rampart.
I have &s;ince been informed, that there are
many pa&s;&s;ages of the &s;ame kind concealed
within the prodigious walls of that edifice,
and which were, undoubtedly, contrived
for the purpo&s;e of facilitating e&s;capes in
time of war. Through this avenue, at
the dead of night, I often &s;tole to the ter|race,
where I walked with the utmo&s;t cau|tion,
left my &s;teps &s;hould betray me to the
&s;entinels on duty in di&s;tant parts; for this
end of it, being guarded by high build|ings,
was not watched by &s;oldiers. In
one of the&s;e midnight wanderings, I &s;aw
light in a ca&s;ement that overlooked the
rampart, and which, I ob&s;erved, was im|mediately
over my pri&s;on-chamber. It
occurred to me, that you might be in that
apartment, and, with the hope of &s;eeing
you, I placed my&s;elf oppo&s;ite to the win|dow.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily remembering the figure that
had formerly appeared on the terrace, and
which had occa&s;ioned her &s;o much anxiety,
<PB N="321" REF="323">
exclaimed, &startq;It was? you then, Mon&s;ieur
Du Pont, who occa&s;ioned me much fool|i&s;h
terror; my &s;pirits were, at chat time,
&s;o much weakened by long &s;uffering, that
they took alarm at every hint.&endq;Du Pont,
after lamenting, that he had occa&s;ioned
her any apprehen&s;ion, added, &startq;As I
re&s;ted on the wall, oppo&s;ite to your ca&s;e|ment,
the con&s;ideration of your melan|choly
&s;ituation and of my own called
from me involuntary &s;ounds of lamentar|tion,
which drew you, I fancy, to the
ca&s;ement; I &s;aw there a per&s;on, whom I
believed to be you. O! I will &s;ay no|thing
of my emotion at that moment; I
wi&s;hed to &s;peak, but prudence re&s;trained
me, till the di&s;tant foot-&s;tep of a &s;entinel
compelled me &s;uddenly to quit my &s;ta|tion.</P>
<P>&startq;It was &s;ome time, before I had ano|ther
opportunity of walking, for I could
only leave my pri&s;on, when it happened
to be the turn of one man to guard me;
meanwhile I became convinced from &s;ome
<PB N="322" REF="324">
circum&s;tances related by him, that your
apartment was over mine, and, when
again I ventured forth, I returned to your
ca&s;ement, where again I &s;aw you, but
without daring to &s;peak. I waved my
hand, and you &s;uddenly di&s;appeared; then
it was, that I forgot my prudence, and
yielded to lamentation; again you ap|peared
&mdash;you &s;poke&mdash;I heard the well|known
accent of your voice! and, at that
moment, my di&s;cretion would have for|&s;aken
me again, had I not heard al&s;o the
approaching &s;teps of a &s;oldier, when I in|$tantly
quitted the place, though not be|fore
the man had &s;een me. He followed
down the terrace and gained &s;o fa&s;t upon
me, that I was compelled to make u&s;e of
a &s;tratagem, ridiculous enough, to &s;ave
my&s;elf. I had heard of the &s;upper&s;tition of
many of the&s;e men, and I uttered a &s;trange
noi&s;e, with a hope, that my pur&s;uer would
im&s;take it for &s;omething &s;upernatural, and
de&s;i&s;t from pur&s;uit. Luckily for my&s;elf
I &s;ucceeded; the man, it &s;eems, was &s;ob|ject
<PB N="323" REF="325">
to fits, and the terror he &s;uffered threw
him into one, by which accident I &s;ecured
my retreat. A &s;en&s;e of the danger I had
e&s;caped, and the increa&s;ed watchfulne&s;s,
which my appearance had occa&s;ioned a|mong
the &s;entinels, deterred me ever after
from walking on the terrace; but, in the
&s;tillne&s;s of night, I frequently beguiled my|&s;elf
with an old lute, procured for me by
a &s;oldier, which I &s;ometimes accompanied
with my voice, and &s;ometimes, I will ac|knowledge,
with a hope of making my&s;elf
heard by you; but it was only a few even|ings
ago, that this hope was an&s;wered. I
then thought I heard a voice in the wind,
calling me; yet, even then I feared to re|ply,
le&s;t the &s;entinel at the pri&s;on door
&s;hould hear me. Was I right, madam, in
this conjecture&mdash;was it you who &s;poke?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes,&startq;&s;aid Emily&endq; with an involun|tary
&s;igh, &startq;you was right indeed.&endq;</P>
<P>Du Pont, ob&s;erving the painful emo|tions,
which this que&s;tion revived, now
changed the &s;ubject &startq;In one of my ex|cur&s;ions
<PB N="324" REF="326">
through the pa&s;&s;age, which I have
mentioned, I overheard a Singular conver|&s;ation,&endq;
&s;aid he.
&startq;In the pa&s;&s;age!&endq;&s;aid Emily, with
&s;urpri&s;e.
&startq;I heard it in the pa&s;&s;age,&endq;&s;aid Du
Pont, &startq;but it proceeded from an apart|ment,
adjoining the wall, within which the
pa&s;&s;age wound, and the &s;hell of the wall
was there &s;o thin, and was al&s;o &s;omewhat decayed, that I could di&s;tinctly hear every
word, &s;poken on the other &s;ide. It happened
that Montoni and his companions were a&s;|&s;embled
in the room, and Montoni began
to relate the extraordinary hi&s;tory of the
lady, his predece&s;&s;or, in the ca&s;tle. He
did, indeed, mention &s;ome very &s;urpri&s;ing
circum&s;tances, and whether they were
&s;trictly true, his con&s;cience mu&s;t decide; I
fear it will determine again&s;t him. But
you, madam, have doubtle&s;s heard the re|port,
which he de&s;igns &s;hould circulate,
on the &s;ubject of that lady's my&s;terious
fate.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="327">
&startq;I have, &s;ir,&endq;replied Emily, &startq;and I perceive, that you doubt it,&endq;
&startq;I doubted it before the period I am
&s;peaking of,&endq;rejoined Du Pont;&mdash;&startq;but
&s;ome circum&s;tances, mentioned by Mon|toni,
greatly contributed to my &s;u&s;picions.
The account I then heard, almo&s;t con|vinced
me, that he was a murderer. I
trembled for you;&mdash;the more &s;o that I had
heard the gue&s;ts mention your name in a
manner, that threatened your repo&s;e; and,
knowing, that the mo&s;t impious men are
often the mo&s;t &s;uper&s;titious, I determined
to try whether I could not awaken their
con&s;ciences, and awe them from the com|mi&s;&s;ion.
of the crime I dreaded. I li&s;tened
clo&s;ely to Montoni, and, in the mo&s;t &s;trik|ing
pa&s;&s;ages of his &s;tory, I joined my voice,
and repeated his la&s;t words, in a di&s;gui&s;ed
and hollow tone.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But was you not afraid of being di&s;covered?&endq;&s;aid Emily.</P>
<P>&startq;I was not,&endq;replied Du Pont; &startq;for
I knew, that, if Montoni had been ac|quainted
<PB N="326" REF="328">
with the &s;ecret of this pa&s;&s;age, he
would not have confined me in the apart|ment,
to which it led, I knew al&s;o, from
better authority, that he was ignorant of it.
The party, for some time, appeared inat|tentive
to my voice; but, at length, were &s;o
much alarmed, that they quitted the
apartment; and, having heard Montoni
order his &s;ervants to &s;earch it, I returned
to my pri&s;on, which was very di&s;tant from
this part of the pa&s;&s;age.&endq;&startq;I remember
perfectly to have heard of the conver&s;ation
you mention,&endq; &s;aid Emily; &startq;it &s;pread a
general alarm among Montoni's people,
and I will own I was weak enough to par|take
of it&endq;</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur Du Pont and Emily thus
continued to conver&s;e of Montoni, and
then of France, and of the plan of their
voyage; when Emily told him, that it
was her inten$n to retire to a convent in
Languedoc, where &s;he had been formerly
treated with much kindne&s;s, and from
thence to write to her relation Mon&s;ieur
<PB N="327" REF="329">
Que&s;nel, and inform him of her conduct.
There, &s;he de&s;igned to wait, till La Vall$e
&s;hould again be her own, whither &s;he
hoped her income would &s;ome time per|mit
her to return; for Du Pont now taught
her to expect, that the e&s;tate, of which
Montoni had attempted to defraud her,
was not irrecoverably lo&s;t, and he again
congratulated her on her e&s;cape from Mon|toni,
who, he had not a doubt, meant to
have detained her for life. The po&s;&s;ibility
of recovering her aunt's e&s;tates for Valan|court
and her&s;elf lighted up a joy in
Emily's heart, &s;uch as &s;he had not known
for many months; but &s;he endeavoured to
conceal this from Mon&s;ieur Du Pont, left
it &s;hould lead him to a painful remem|brance
of his rival.</P>
<P>they continued to conver&s;e, till the
&s;un was declining in the we&s;t, when
Du Pont awoke Ludovico, and they
&s;et forward on their journey. Gradually
defcending the lower &s;lopes of the valley,
they reached the Arno, and wound along
<PB N="328" REF="330">
its pa&s;toral margin, for many miles, de|lighted
with the &s;cenery around them, and
with the remembrances, which its cla&s;&s;ic
waves revived. At a di&s;tance, they heard
the gay &s;ong of the pea&s;ants among the
vineyards, and ob&s;erved the &s;etting &s;un
tint the waves with yellow lu&s;tre, and twi|light
draw a du&s;ky purple over the moun|tains,
which, at length, deepened into
night. Then the <HI>lucciola,</HI> the fire-fly of
Tu&s;cany, was &s;een to fla&s;h its &s;udden &s;parks
among the foliage, while the <HI>cicala,</HI> with
its &s;hrill note, became more clamorous
than, even during the noon-day heat, lov|ing
be&s;t the hour when the English beetle,
with le&s;s offen&s;ive &s;ound,
<Q><L>&mdash;&startq;winds</L>
<L>His &s;mall but &s;ullen horn,</L>
<L>As oft he ri&s;es, mid&s;t the twilight path,</L>
<L>Again&s;t the pilgrim bron in heedle&s;s hum<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Collins.</NOTE>.&endq;</L></Q></P>
<P>The travellers cro&s;&s;ed the Arno by
moon-light, at a ferry, and learning, that
Pi&s;a was di&s;tant only a few miles down the
<PB N="329" REF="331">
river, they wi&s;hed to have proceeded thi|ther
in a boat, but, as none could be pro|cured,
they &s;et out on their wearied hor&s;es
for that city. As they approached it, the
vale expandedinto a plain, variegated
with vineyards, corn, olives and mulberry
groves; but it was late, before they reached
its gates, where Emily was &s;urpri&s;ed to
hear the bu&s;y &s;ound of &s;oot&s;teps and the
tones of mu&s;ical in&s;truments, as well as to
&s;ee the lively groups, that filled the &s;treets,
and &s;he almo&s;t fancied her&s;elf again at
Venice; but here was no moon-light &s;ea&mdash;
no gay gondolas, da&s;hing the waves,&mdash;no
<HI>Palladian</HI> palaces, to throw enchantment
over the fancy and lead it into the wilds
of fairy &s;tory. The Arno rolled through
the town, but no mu&s;ic trembled from bal|conies
over its waters; it gave only the
bu&s;y voices of &s;ailors on board ve&s;&s;els ju&s;t
arrived from the Mediterranean; the me|lancholy
heaving of the anchor, and the
&s;hrill boat&s;wain's whi&s;tle;&mdash;&s;ounds, which, &s;ince that period, have there &s;unk almo&s;t
<PB N="330" REF="332">
into &s;ilence. They then &s;erved to remind
Du Pont, that it was probable he might
hear of a ve&s;&s;el, &s;ailing &s;oon to France from
this port, and thus be &s;pared the trouble of
going to Leghorn. As &s;oon as Emily had reached
the inn, he went therefore to the
quay, to make his enquiries; but, after all
the endeavours of him&s;elf and Ludovico,
they could hear of no bark, de&s;tined im|mediately
for France, and the travellers re|turned
to their re&s;ting-place. Here al&s;o, Du
Pont endeavoured to learn where his regi|ment
then lay, but could acquire no inform|ation
concerning it. The travellers retired
early to re&s;t, after the fatigues of this day;
and, on the following, ro&s;e early, and, without
pau&s;ing to view the celebrated antiquities
of the place, or the wonders of its hang|ing
tower, pur&s;ued their journey in the
cooler hours, through a charming country,
rich with wine, and corn and oil. The
Apennines, no longer awful, or even grand,
here &s;oftened into the beauty of &s;ylvan and
pa&s;toral land&s;cape; and Emily, as &s;he de|&s;cended
<PB N="331" REF="333">
them, looked down delighted on
Leghorn, and its &s;pacious bay, filled with
ve&s;&s;els, and crowned with the&s;e beautiful hills.</P>
<P>She was no le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed and amu&s;ed,
on entering this town, to find it crowded
with per&s;ons in the dre&s;&s;es of all nations;
a &s;cene, which reminded her of a Venetian
ma&s;querade, &s;uch as &s;he had witne&s;&s;ed at the time of the Carnival; but here, was
bu&s;tle, without gaiety, and noi&s;e in&s;tead
of mu&s;ic, while elegance was to be looked
for only in the waving outlines of the &s;ur|rounding
hills.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur Du Pont, immediately on
their arrival, went down to the quay, where
he heard of &s;everal French ve&s;&s;els, and of
one, that was to fail, in a few days, for
Mar&s;eilles, from whence another ve&s;&s;el
could be procured, without difficulty, to
take them acro&s;s the gulf of Lyons towards
Narbonne, on the coa&s;t not many leagues
from which city he under&s;tood the convent
was &s;eated, to which Emily wi&s;hed to retire.
<PB N="332" REF="334">
He, therefore, immediately engaged with
the captain to take them to Mar&s;eilles, and
Emily was delighted to hear, that her pa&s;|&s;age
to France was &s;ecured. Her mind
was now relieved from the terror of pur&s;uit,
and the plea&s;ing hope of &s;oon &s;eeing
her native country&mdash;that country which
held Valancourt, re&s;tored to her &s;pirits a
degree of cheerfulne&s;s, &s;uch as &s;he had
&s;carcely known, &s;ince the death of her fa|ther.
At Leghorn al&s;o, Du Pont heard of
his regiment, and that it had embarked
for France; a circumstance, which gave
him great &s;atisfaction, for he could now
accompany Emily thither, without re|proach
ot his con&s;cience, or apprehen&s;ion
of di&s;plea&s;ure from his commander. Dur|ing
the&s;e days, he &s;crupulou&s;ly forbore to
di&s;tre&s;s her by a mention of his pa&s;&s;ion,
and &s;he was compelled to e&s;teem and pity,
though &s;he could not love, him. He en|deavoured
to amu&s;e her by &s;hewing the
environs of the town, and they often walk|ed
together on the &s;ea-&s;hore, and on the
<PB N="333" REF="335">
bu&s;y quays, where Emily was frequently
intere&s;ted by the arrival and departure of
ve&s;&s;els, participating in the joy of meeting
friends, and, &s;ometimes, &s;hedding a &s;ympa|thetic
tear to the &s;orrow of tho&s;e, that were
&s;eparating. It was after having witne&s;&s;ed
a &s;cene of the latter kind, that &s;he arranged
the following &s;tanzas:</P>

<P>WE now return to Languedoc and to
the mention of Count De Villefort, the
nobleman, who &s;ucceeded to an e&s;tate of
the Marquis De Villeroi, &s;ituated near the
mona&s;tery of Sr. Claire. It may be re|collected,
that this chateau was uninha|bited,
when St. Aubert and his daughter
were in the neighbourhood, and that the
former was much affected on di&s;covering
him&s;elf to be &s;o near Chateau-le-Blanc,
a place, concerning which the good old
La Voi&s;in afterwards dropped &s;ome hints,
that had alarmed Emily's curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>It was in the year 1584, the beginning
of that, in which St. Aubert died, that
Francis Beauveau, Count De Villefort,
<PB N="337" REF="339">
came into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the man&s;ion and
exten&s;ive domain called Chateau-le-Blanc,
&s;ituated in the province of Languedoc, on the &s;hore of the Mediterranean, This
e&s;tate, which, during &s;ome centuries, had
belonged to his family, now de&s;cended to
him, on the decea&s;e of his relative, the
Marquis De Villeroi, who had been lat|terly
a man of re&s;erved manners and au&s;|tere
character; circum&s;tances, which, to|gether
with the duties of his profe&s;&s;ion,
that often called him into the field, had
prevented any degree of intimacy with his
cou&s;in, the Count De Villefort. For many
years, they had known little of each other, and the Count received the fir&s;t intelli|gence
of his death, which happened in a
di&s;tant part of France, together with the in&s;truments, that gave him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the domain Chateau-le-BIanc; but it was
not till the following year, that he deter|mined
to vi&s;it that e&s;tate, when he de&s;ign|ed
to pa&s;s the autumn there. The &s;cenes
of Chateau-le-Blanc often came to his
<PB N="338" REF="340">
remembrance, heightened by the touches,
which a warm imagination gives to the
recollection of early plea&s;ures; for many
years before, in the life-time of the Mar-chione&s;s, and at that age when the mind
is particularly &s;en&s;ible to impre&s;&s;ions of
gaiety and delight, he had once vi&s;ited this
&s;pot, and, though he had pa&s;&s;ed a long
intervening period amid&s;t the vexations
and tumults of public affairs, which too
frequently corrode the heart, and vitiate
the ta&s;te, the &s;hades of Languedoc and
the grandeur of its di&s;tant &s;cenery had
never been remembered by him with in|difference.</P>
<P>During many years, the chateau had been
abandoned by the late Marquis, and, being
inhabited only by an old &s;teward and his
wife, had been &s;uffered to fall much into
decay. To &s;uperintend the repairs, that
would be requi&s;ite to make it a comfort|able
re&s;idence, had been a principal mo|tive
with the Count for pa&s;&s;ing the autum|nal
months in Languedoc; and neither
<PB N="339" REF="341">
the remon&s;trances, or the tears of the Coun|te&s;s,
for, on urgent occa&s;ions, &s;he could
weep, were powerful enough to overcome
his determination. She prepared, there|fore,
to obey the command, which &s;he
could not conquer, and to re&s;ign the gay a&s;&s;emblies of Paris,&mdash;where her beauty was
generally unrivalled and won the applau&s;e,
to which her wit had but feeble claim&mdash;
for the twilight canopy of woods, the
lonely grandeur of mountains and the &s;o|lemnity
of gothic halls and of long, long
galleries, which echoed only the &s;olitary
&s;tep of a dome&s;tic, or the mea&s;ured clink,
that a&s;cended from the great clock&mdash;the
ancient monitor of the hall below. From
the&s;e melancholy expectations &s;he endea|voured
to relieve her &s;pirits by recollect|ing
all that &s;he had ever heard, concern|ing
the joyous vintage of the plains of
Languedoc; but there, alas! no airy
forms would bound to the gay melody of
Pari&s;ian dances, and a view of the ru&s;tic
$word$ of pea&s;ants could afford little
<PB N="340" REF="342">
plea&s;ure to a heart, in which even the feel|ings
of ordinary benevolence had long
&s;ince decayed under the corruptions of
luxury.</P>
<P>The Count had a &s;on and a daughter,
the children of a former marriage, who,
he de&s;igned, &s;hould accompany him to
the &s;outh. of France; Henri, who was in
his twentieth year, was in the French &s;er|vice;
and Blanche, who was not yet eigh|teen,
had been hitherto confined to the
convent, where &s;he had been placed imme|diately
on her father's &s;econd marriage.
The pre&s;ent Counte&s;s, who had neither
&s;ufficient ability, or inclination, to &s;uper|intend
the education of her daughter-in-law,
had advi&s;ed this &s;tep, and the dread
of &s;uperior beauty had &s;ince urged her
to employ every art, that might prevail
on the Count to prolong the period of
Blanche's &s;eclu&s;ion; it was, therefore, with
extreme mortification, that &s;he now un|der&s;tood
he would no longer &s;ubmit on
this &s;ubject, yet it afforded her &s;ome con|&s;olation
<PB N="341" REF="343">
to con&s;ider, that, though the Lady
Blanche would emerge from her convent,
the &s;hades of the country would, for &s;ome
time, veil her beauty from the public eye.</P>
<P>On the morning, which commenced
the journey, the po&s;tillions &s;topped at the
convent, by the Count's order, to take up
Blanche, who&s;e heart beat with delight,
at the pro&s;pect of novelty and freedom
now before her. As the time of her de|parture
drew nigh, her impatience had
increa&s;ed, and the la&s;t night, during
which &s;he counted every note of every
hour, had appeared the mo&s;t tedious of
any &s;he had ever known. The morning
light, at length, dawned; the matin-bell
rang; &s;he heard the nuns de&s;cending
from their chambers, and &s;he &s;tarted from
a &s;leeple&s;s pillow to welcome the day,
which was to emancipate her from the
&s;everities of a cloi&s;ter, and introduce her
to a world, where plea&s;ure was ever &s;mil|ing,
and goodne&s;s ever ble&s;&s;ed&mdash;where,
in &s;hort, nothing but plea&s;ure and good|ne&s;s
<PB N="342" REF="344">
reigned! When the bell of the great gate
rang, and the &s;ound was followed by
that of carriage wheels, &s;he ran, with a
palpitating heart, to her lattice, and, per|ceiving
her father's carriage in the court
below, danced, with airy &s;teps, along the
gallery, where &s;he was met by a nun with
a &s;ummons from the abbe&s;s. In the next
moment, &s;he was in the parlour, and in
the pre&s;ence of the Counte&s;s who now
appeared to her as an angel, that was to
lead her into happine&s;s. But the emotions
of the Counte&s;s, on beholding her, were
not in uni&s;on with tho&s;e of Blanche, who
had never appeared &s;o lovely as at this mo|ment,
when her countenance, animated
by the lightning &s;mile of joy, glowed
with the beauty of happy innocence.</P>
<P>After conver&s;ing for a few minutes with
the abbe&s;s, the Counte&s;s ro&s;e to go. This
was the moment, which Blanche had an|ticipated
with &s;uch eager expectation, the
&s;ummit from which &s;he looked down upon
the fairy-land of happine&s;s, and &s;urveyed,
<PB N="343" REF="345">
all its enchantment; was it a moment,
then, for tears of regret? Yet it was &s;o.
She turned, with an altered and dejected
countenance, to her young companions,
who were come to bid her farewell, and
wept! Even my lady abbe&s;s, &s;o &s;tately
and &s;o &s;olemn, &s;he &s;aluted with a degree
of &s;orrow, which, an hour before, &s;he
would have believed it impo&s;&s;ible to feel,
and which may be accounted for by con|&s;idering
how reluctantly we all part, even with
unplea&s;ing objects, when the &s;epa|ration
is con&s;ciou&s;ly for ever. Again, &s;he
ki&s;&s;ed the poor nuns and then followed the
Counte&s;s from that &s;pot with tears, which
&s;he expected to leave only with &s;miles.</P>
<P>But the pre&s;ence of her father and the
variety of objects, on the road, &s;oon en|gaged
her attention, and di&s;&s;ipated the
&s;hade, which tender regret had thrown
upon her &s;pirits. Inattentive to a conver|&s;ation,
which was pa&s;&s;ing between the
Counte&s;s and a Mademoi&s;elle Bearn, her
friend, Blanche &s;at, lo&s;t in plea&s;ing reverie,
<PB N="344" REF="346">
as &s;he watched the clouds floating &s;ilently
along the blue expan&s;e, now veiling the
&s;un and &s;tretching their &s;hadows along the
di&s;tant &s;cene, and then di&s;clo&s;ing all his
brightne&s;s. The journey continued to
give Blanche inexpre&s;&s;ible delight, for
new &s;cenes of nature were every in&s;tant
opening to her view, and her fancy be|came
&s;tored with gay and beautiful ima|gery.</P>
<P>It was on the evening of the &s;eventh day,
that the travellers came within view of
Chateau-le-Blanc, the romantic beauty of
who&s;e &s;ituation &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed the ima|gination
of Blanche, who ob&s;erved, with
&s;ublime a&s;toni&s;hment, the Pyrenean moun|tains,
which, had been &s;een only at a di&s;|tance
during the day, now ri&s;ing within
a few leagues, with their wild cliffs and
immen&s;e precipices, which the evening
clouds, floating round them, now di&s;|clo&s;ed,
and again veiled. The &s;etting
rays, that tinged their &s;nowy &s;ummits
with a ro&s;eate hue, touched their lower
<PB N="345" REF="347">
points with various colouring, while the
bluei&s;h tint, that pervaded their &s;hadowy
rece&s;&s;es, gave the &s;trength of contra&s;t to
the &s;plendour of light. The plains of Lan|guedoc,
blu&s;hing with the purple vine and
diversified with groves of mulberry, al|mond
and olives, &s;pread far to the north
and the ea&s;t; to the &s;outh, appeared the
Mediterranean, clear as cry&s;tal, and blue as
the heavens it reflected, bearing on its bo|&s;om
ve&s;&s;els, who&s;e white fails caught the
fun-beams,, and gave animation to the
&s;cene. On a high promontory, wa&s;hed
by the waters of the Mediterranean, flood
her father's man&s;ion, almo&s;t &s;ecluded from
the eye by woods of intermingled pine,
oak and che&s;nut, which crowned the emi|nence,,
and &s;loped towards the plains, on
one &s;ide; while, on the other, they ex|tended
to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance along
the &s;ea-&s;hores.</P>
<P>As Blanche drew nearer, the gothic
features of this antient man&s;ion &s;ucce&s;&s;ively
appeared&mdash;fir&s;t an embattled turret, ri&s;ing
<PB N="346" REF="348">
above the trees&mdash;then the broken arch of
an immen&s;e gate-way, retiring beyond
them; and &s;he almo&s;t fancied her&s;elf ap|proaching
a ca&s;tle, &s;uch as is often cele|brated
in early &s;tory, where the knights
look out from the battlements on &s;ome
champion below, who, clothed in black
armour, comes, with his companions, to
re&s;cue the fair lady of his love from the
oppre&s;&s;ion of his rival; a &s;ort of legends,
to which &s;he had once or twice obtain|ed
acce&s;s in the library of her convent,
that, like many others, belonging to the
monks, was &s;tored with the&s;e reliques of
romantic fiction.</P>
<P>The carriages &s;lopped at a gate, which
led into the domain of the chateau, but
which, was now fa&s;tened; and the great
bell, that had formerly &s;erved to an|nounce
the arrival of &s;trangers, having
long &s;ince fallen from its &s;tation, a &s;ervant
climbed over a, ruined part of the adjoining
wall, to give notice to tho&s;e within of the
arrival of their loid.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="349">
As Blanche leaned from the coach win|dow,
&s;he re&s;igned her&s;elf to the &s;weet and
gentle emotions, which the hour and the
&s;cenery awakened. The &s;un had now left
the earth, and twilight began to darken the
mountains; while the di&s;tant waters, re|flecting
the blu&s;h that &s;till glowed in the
we&s;t, appeared like a line of light, &s;kirt|ing
the horizon. The low murmur of
waves, breaking on the &s;hore, came in
the breeze, and, now and then, the me|lancholy
da&s;hing of oars was feebly heard
from a di&s;tance. She was &s;$ffered to in|dulge
her pen&s;ive mood, for the thoughts
of the re&s;t of the party were &s;ilently en|gaged
upon the &s;ubjects of their &s;everal
intere&s;ts. Meanwhile, the Counte&s;s, re|flecting,
with regret, upon the gay parties
&s;he had left at Paris, &s;urveyed, with di&s;|gu&s;t,
what &s;he thought the gloomy woods
and &s;olitary wildne&s;s of the &s;cene; and,
&s;hrinking from the pro&s;pect of being &s;hut
up in an old ca&s;tle, was prepared to meet
every object with di&s;plea&s;ure. The feel|ings
<PB N="348" REF="350">
of Henri were &s;omewhat &s;imilar to
tho&s;e of the Counte&s;s; he gave a mourn|ful
&s;igh to the delights of the capital, and
to the remembrance of a lady, who, he
believed, had engaged his affections, and
who had certainly fa&s;cinated his imagina|tion;
but the &s;urrounding country, and
the mode of life, on which he was enter|ing,
had, for him, at lea&s;t, the charm of
novelty, and his regret was &s;oftened by
the gay expectations of youth.</P>
<P>The gates being at length unbarred, the
carriage moved &s;lowly on, under &s;preading
che&s;nuts, that almo&s;t excluded the remains
of day, following what had been formerly
a road, but which now, overgrown with
luxuriant vegetation, could be traced only
by the boundary, formed by trees, on ei|ther
&s;ide, and which wound for near half a
mile among the woods, before it reached
the chateau. This was the very avenue
that St. Auhert and Emily had formerly
entered, on their fir&s;t arrival in the neigh|bourhood
with the hope of finding a hou&s;e,
<PB N="349" REF="351">
that would receive them, for the night,
and had &s;o abruptly quitted, on perceiving
the wildne&s;s of the place, and a figure,
which the po&s;tillion had fancied was a
robber.</P>
<P>&startq;What a di&s;mal place is this!&endq; ex|claimed
the Counte&s;s, as the carriage pene|trated
the deeper rece&s; &s;es of the woods.
&startq;Surely, my lord, you do not mean to
pa&s;s all the autumn in this barbarous &s;pot!
One ought to bring hither a cup of the
waters of Lethe, that the remembrance of
plea&s;anter &s;cenes may not heighten, at
lea&s;t, the natural drearine&s;s of the&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;hall be governed by circum&s;tances,

<P>The carriage now &s;topped at the cha|teau,
where, at the door of the great hall,
appeared the old &s;teward and the Pari&s;ian
&s;ervants, who had been &s;ent to prepare the
chateau, waiting to receive their lord.
Lady Blanche now perceived, that the edi|fice
was not built entirely in the gothic
<PB N="350" REF="352">
&s;tyle, but that it had additions of a more
modern date; the large and gloomy hall,
however, into which &s;he now entered, was
entirely gothic, and &s;umptuous tape&s;try,
which it was now too dark to di&s;tingui&s;h,
hung upon the walls, and depictured &s;cenes
from &s;ome of the antient Provencal ro|man&ccedil;es.
A va&s;t gothic window, embroi|dered
with <HI>clematis</HI> and eglantine, that a&s;|cended
to the &s;outh, led the eye, now that
the ca&s;ements were thrown open, through
this verdant &s;hade, over a &s;loping lawn,
to the tops of dark woods, that hung upon
the brow of the promontory. Beyond, ap|peared
the waters of the Mediterranean,
&s;tretching far to the &s;outh, and to the ea&s;t,
where they were lo&s;t in the horizon; while,
to the north-ea&s;t, they were bounded by
the luxuriant &s;hores of Languedoc and
Provence, enriched with wood, and gay
with vines and &s;loping pa&s;tures; and, to
the &s;outh-we&s;t, by the maje&s;tic Pyren$es,
now fading from the eye, beneath the gra|dual
gloom.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="353">
Blanche, as &s;he cro&s;&s;ed the hall, &s;topped
a moment to ob&s;erve this lovely pro&s;pect,
which the evening twilight ob&s;cured, yet
did not conceal. But &s;he was quickly
awakened from the complacent delight,
which this &s;cene had diffu&s;ed upon her
mind, by the Counte&s;s, who, di&s;contented
with every object around, and impatient
for refreshment and repo&s;e, ha&s;tened for|ward
to a large parlour, who&s;e cedar
wain&s;cot, narrow, pointed ca&s;ements, and
dark ceiling of carved cypre&s;s wood, gave
it an a&s;pect of peculiar gloom, which the
dingy green velvet of the chairs and
co$ches, fringed with tarni&s;hed gold, had
once been de&s;igned to enliven.</P>
<P>While the Counte&s;s enquired for refre&s;h|ment,
the Count, attended by his &s;on,
went to look over-&s;bme part of the chateau,
and Lady Blanche reluctantly remained to
witne&s;s the di&s;content and ill-humour of
her &s;tep-mother.</P>
<P>&startq;How long have you lived in this de|&s;olate
place?&endq; &s;aid her lady&s;hip, to the old
<PB N="352" REF="354">
hou&s;e-keeper, who came to pay her duty.
&startq;Above twenty years, your lady&s;hip,
on the next fea&s;t of St. Jerome.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How happened it, that you have lived
here &s;o long, and almo&s;t alone, too? I un|der&s;tood,
that the chateau, had been &s;hut
up for &s;ome years?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, madam, it was for many years
after my late lord, the Count, went to
the wars; but it is above twenty years,
&s;ince I and my hu&s;band came into his &s;er|vice.
The place is &s;o. large, and has of
late been &s;o lonely, that we were lo&s;t in it,
and, after &s;ome time, we went to live
in a cottage at the end of the woods, near
&s;ome of the tenants, and came to look af|ter
the chateau, every now and then.
When my lord returned to France from
the wars, he took a di&s;like to the place,
and never came to live here again, and &s;o
he was &s;atisfied with our remaining at the
cottage. Alas&mdash;alas! how the chateau is
changed from what it once was! What
delight my late lady u&s;ed to take in it! I
<PB N="353" REF="355">
well remember when &s;he came here a bride,
and how fine it was. Now, it has been ne|glected
&s;o long, and is gone into &s;uch de|cay!
I &s;hall never &s;ee tho&s;e days again!&endq;</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s appearing to be &s;omewhat
offended by the thoughtle&s;s &s;implicity, with
which the old woman regretted former
times, Doroth&eacute;e added&mdash;&startq;But the chateau
will now be inhabited, and cheerful again;
not all the world could tempt me to live
in it alone.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, the experiment will not be
made, I believe,&endq; &s;aid the Counte&s;s, di&s;|plea&s;ed
that her own &s;ilence had been un|able
to awe the loquacity of this ru&s;tic
old hou&s;ekeeper, now &s;pared from further
attendance by the entrance of the Count,
who &s;aid he had been viewing part of the
chateau, and found, that it would require
con&s;iderable repairs and &s;ome alterations,
before it would be perfectly comfortable,
as a place of re&s;idence. &startq;I am &s;orry to
hear it, my lord,&endq; replied the Counte&s;s.
&startq;And why &s;orry, madam?&endq; Becau&s;e
<PB N="354" REF="356">
the place will ill repay your trouble; and
were it even a paradi&s;e, it would be in&s;uf|ferable
at &s;uch a di&s;tance from Paris.&endq;</P>
<P>The Count made no reply, but walked
abruptly to a window. &startq;There are win|dows,
my lord, but they neither admit en|tertainment,
or light; they &s;hew only a
&s;cene of &s;avage nature.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am at a lo&s;s, madam,&endq; &s;aid the
Count, &startq;to conjecture what you mean by
&s;avage nature. Do tho&s;e plains, or tho&s;e
woods, or that fine expan&s;e of water, de|&s;erve
the name?&endq;
&startq;Tho&s;e mountains certainly do, my
lord,&endq; rejoined the Counte&s;s, pointing to
the Pyren&eacute;es, &startq;and this chateau, though
not a work of rude nature, is, to my ta&s;te,
at lea&s;t, one of &s;avage art.&endq; The Count
coloured highly. &startq;This place, madam,
was the work of my ance&s;tors.&endq; &s;aid he,
&startq;and you mu&s;t allow me to &s;ay, that your
pre&s;ent conver&s;ation di&s;covers neither good
ta&s;te, or good manners.&endq; Blanche, now
&s;hocked at an altercation, which appeared
<PB N="355" REF="357">
to be increa&s;ing to a &s;erious di&s;agreement,
ro&s;e to leave the room, when her mother's
woman entered it; and the Counte&s;s, im|mediately
de&s;iring to be &s;hewn to her own
apartment, withdrew, attended by Made|moi&s;elle
Bearn.</P>
<P>Lady Blanche, it being not yet dark,
took this opportunity of exploring new
&s;cenes, and, leaving the parlour, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed
from the hall into a wide gallery, who&s;e
walls were decorated by marble pila&s;ters,
which &s;upported an arched roof, compo&s;ed
of a rich mo&s;aic work. Through a di&s;|tant
window, that &s;eemed to terminate the
gallery, were &s;een the purple clouds of
evening and a land&s;cape, who&s;e features,
thinly veiled in twilight, no longer ap|peared
di&s;tinctly, but, blended into one
grand ma&s;s, &s;tretched to the horizon, co|loured
only with a tint of &s;olemn grey.</P>
<P>The gallery terminated in a &s;aloon, to
which the window &s;he had &s;een through an
open door, belonged; but the increasing
du&s;k permitted her only an imperfect view
<PB N="356" REF="358">
of this apartment, which &s;eemed to be
magnificent and of modern architecture;
though it had been either &s;uffered to fall
into decay, or had never been properly
fini&s;hed. The windows, which were nu|merous
and large, de&s;cended low, and af|forded
a very extensive, and what Blanche's
fancy repre&s;ented to be, a very lovely
pro&s;pect; and &s;he &s;tood for &s;ome time,
$urveying the grey ob&s;cu$i$y, and depic|turing
imaginary woods and mountains,
vallies and rivers, on this &s;cene of night;
her &s;olemn &s;en&s;ations rather a&s;&s;i&s;ted, than
interrupted, by the di&s;tant bark of a watch|dog,
and by the breeze, as it trembled
upon the light foliage of the &s;hrubs. Now
and then, appeared for a moment, among
the woods, a cottage light; and, at length,
was heard, afar off, the evening bell of a
convent, dying on the air. When &s;he
withdrew her thoughts from the&s;e &s;ubjects
of fanciful delight, the gloom and &s;ilence
of the &s;aloon &s;omewhat awed her; and,
having &s;ought the door of the gallery, and
<PB N="357" REF="359">
pur&s;ued, for a con&s;iderable time, a dark
pa&s;&s;age, &s;he came to a hall, but one to|tally
different from that &s;he had formerly
&s;een. By the twilight, admitted through
an open portico, &s;he could ju&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h
this apartment to be of very light and. airy
architecture, and that it was paved with
white marble, pillars of which &s;upported
the roof, that ro&s;e into arches built in the
Moori&s;h &s;tyle. While Blanche &s;tood on
the &s;teps of this portico, the moon ro&s;e
over the &s;ea, and gradually di&s;clo&s;ed, in
partial light, the beauties of the eminence,
on which &s;he &s;tood, whence a lawn, now
rude and overgrown with high gra&s;s, &s;loped
to the woods, that, almo&s;t &s;urrounding
the chateau, extended in a grand &s;weep
down the &s;outhern &s;ides of the promontory
to the very margin of the ocean. Beyond
the woods, on the north-&s;ide, appeared a
long tract of the plains of Languedoc;
and, to the ea&s;t, the land&s;cape &s;he had be|fore
dimly &s;een, with the towers of a mo|na&s;tery,
illumined by the moon, ri&s;ing over
dark groves.</P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="360">
The &s;oft and &s;hadowy tint, that over|&s;pread
the &s;cene, the waves, undulating in
the moon-light, and their low and mea|&s;ured
murmurs on the beach, were circum|&s;tances,
that united to elevate the unac|cu&s;tomed
mind of Blanche to enthu&s;ia&s;im.</P>
<P>&startq;And have I lived in this glorious
world fo long,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &endq;and never till
now beheld &s;uch a pro&s;pect&mdash;never expe|rienced
the&s;e delights! Every pea&s;ant girl,
on my father's domain, has viewed from
her infancy the face of nature; has ranged,
at liberty, her romantic wilds, while I
have been &s;hut in a cloi&s;ter from the
view of the&s;e beautiful appearances, which
were de&s;igned to enchant all eyes, and
awaken all hearts. How can the poor
nuns and. friars feel the full fervour of de|votion,
if they never &s;ee the &s;un ri&s;e,
or &s;et? Never, till this evening, did I
know what true devotion is; for, never
before did I &s;ee the &s;un &s;ink below the
va&s;t earth! To-morrow, for the fir&s;t time
in my life, I will &s;ee it ri&s;e. O who
<PB N="359" REF="361">
would live in Paris, to look upon black
walls and dirty &s;treets, when, in the coun|try,
they might gaze on the blue heavens,
and all the green earth!&endq;</P>
<P>This enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;oliloquy was inter|rupted
by a ru&s;tling noi&s;e in the hall; and,
while the loneline&s;s of the place made her
&s;en&s;ible to fear, &s;he thought &s;he perceived
&s;omething moving between the pillars.
For a moment, &s;he continued &s;ilently ob|&s;erving it,
till, a&s;hamed of her ridiculous
apprehen&s;ions, &s;he recollected courage
enough to demand who was there. &startq;O
my young lady, is it you?&endq; &s;aid the old
hou&s;ekeeper, who was come to &s;hut the
windows, &startq;I am glad it is you.&endq; The
manner, in which &s;he &s;poke this, with a
faint breath, rather &s;urpri&s;ecl Blanche, who
&s;aid, &startq;You &s;eemed frightened, Doroth&eacute;e,
what is the matter?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, not frightened, ma'am&s;elle,&endq; re|plied
Doroth&eacute;e, he&s;itating and trying to
appear compo&s;ed, &startq;but I am old, and&mdash;
a little matter, &s;tartles me.&endq; The Lady
<PB N="360" REF="362">
Blanche &s;miled at the di&s;tinction. &startq;I am
glad, that my lord the Count is come to
live at the chateau, ma'am&s;elle,&endq; continued
Doroth$e, &startq;for it has been many a year
de&s;erred, and dreary enough; now, the
place will look a little as it u&s;ed to do,
when my poor lady was alive.&endq; Blanche
enquired how long it was, &s;ince the Mar|chione&s;s
died? &startq;Alas! my lady, &endq;re|plied
Dorotheacute;e, &startq;&s;o long&mdash;that I have
cea&s;ed to count the years! The place, to
my mind, has mourned ever &s;ince, and I
am &s;ure my lord's va&s;&s;als have! But you
have lo&s;t your&s;elf, ma'am&s;elle,&mdash;&s;hall I
&s;hew you to the other &s;ide of the cha|teau?&endq;</P>
<P>Blanche enquired how long this part of
the edifice had been built. &startq;Soon after
my lord's marriage, ma'am,&endq; replied Do|roth&eacute;e.
&startq;The place was large enough
without this addition, for many rooms of
the old building were even then never
made u&s;e of, and my lord had a princely
hou&s;ehold too; but he thought the antient
<PB N="361" REF="363">
man&s;ion gloomy, and gloomy enough it
is!&endq; Lady Blanche now, de&s;ired to be
&s;hewn to the inhabited part of the cha|teau;
and, as the pa&s;&s;ages were entirely
dark, Doroth&eacute;e conducted her along the
edge of the lawn to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the
edi&s;ice, where, a door opening into the
great hall, &s;he was met by Mademoi&s;elle
Bearn. &startq;Where have you been &s;o long?&endq;
&s;aid &s;he, &startq;I had begun to think &s;ome
wonderful adventure had befallen you, and
that the giant of this enchanted ca&s;tle, or
the gho&s;t, which, no doubt, haunts it, had
conveyed you through a trap-door into
&s;ome &s;ubterranean vault, whence you was
never to return.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No,&endq; replied Blanche, laughingly,
&startq;you &s;eem to love adventures &s;o well, that
I leave them for you to achieve.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, I am willing to achieve them,
provided I am allowed to de&s;cribe them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My dear Mademoi&s;elle Bearn,&endq; &s;aid
Henri, as he met her at the door of the
<PB N="362" REF="364">
parlour, &startq;no gho&s;t of the&s;e days would
be &s;o &s;avage as to impo&s;e &s;ilence on you.
Our gho&s;ts are more civilized than to con|demn
a lady to a purgatory &s;everer even,
than their own, be it what it may.&endq;</P>
<P>Mademoi&s;elle Bearn replied only by a
laugh; and, the Count now entering the
room, &s;upper was &s;erved, during which
he &s;poke little, frequently appeared to
be ab&s;tracted from the company, and
more than once remarked, that the place
was greatly altered, &s;ince he had la&s;t &s;een
it. &startq;Many years have intervened &s;ince
that period,&endq; &s;aid he; &startq;and, though the
grand features of the &s;cenery admit of
no change, they impre&s;s me with &s;en&s;a|tions
very different from tho&s;e I formerly
experienced.&endq;</P>
<P>?&startq;Did the&s;e &s;cenes, &s;ir,&endq; &s;aid Blanche,
&startq;ever appear more lovely, than they do
now? To me this &s;eems hardly po&s;&s;ible.&endq;
The Count, regarding her with a melan|choly
&s;mile, &s;aid, &startq;They once were as
<PB N="363" REF="365">
delightful to me, as they are now to you;
the land&s;cape is not changed, but time has
changed me; from my mind the illu&s;ion,
which gave &s;pirit to the colouring of na|ture,
is fading fa&s;t! If you live, my dear
Blanche, to re$vi&s;it this &s;pot, at the di&s;|tance
of many years, you will, perhaps,
remember and under&s;tand the feelings of
your father.&endq;</P>
<P>Lady Blanche, affected by the&s;e words,
remained &s;ilent; &s;he looked forward to the
period, which the Count anticipated, and
con&s;idering, that he, who now &s;poke,
would then probably be no more, her
eyes, bent to the ground, were filled with
tears. She gave her hand to her father,
who, &s;miling affectionately, ro&s;e from his
chair, and went to a window to conceal
his emotion.</P>
<P>The fatigues of the day made the party
&s;eparate at an early hour, when Blanche
retired through a long oak gallery to her
chamber, who&s;e &s;pacious and lofty walls,
<PB N="364" REF="366">
high antiquated ca&s;ements, and, what was
the effect of the&s;e., its gloomy air, did not
reconcile her to its remote &s;ituation, in
this antient building. The furniture, al&s;o,
was of antient date; the bed was of blue
dama&s;k, trimmed with tarni&s;hed gold lace,
and its lofty te&s;ter ro&s;e in the form of a
canopy, whence the curtains de&s;cended,
like tho&s;e of &s;uch tents as are &s;ometimes
repre&s;ented in old pictures, and, indeed,
much re&s;embling tho&s;e, exhibited on the
faded tape&s;try, with which the chamber
was hung. To Blanche, every object here
was matter of curio&s;ity; and, taking the
light from her woman to examine the
tape&s;try, &s;he perceived, that it repre&s;ented
&s;cenes from the wars of Troy, though the
almo&s;t colourle&s;s wor&s;ted now mocked the
glowing actions they once had painted.
She laughed at the ludicrous ab&s;urdity &s;he
ob&s;erved, till, recollecting, that the hands,
which had wove it, were, like the poet
who&s;e thoughts of fire they had attempted
<PB N="365" REF="367">
to expre&s;s, long &s;ince mouldered into du&s;t,
a train of melancholy ideas pa&s;&s;ed over her
mind, and &s;he almo&s;t wept.</P>
<P>Having given her woman a &s;trict in|junction
to awaken her, before &s;un-ri&s;e,
&s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her; and then, to di&s;&s;ipate
the gloom, which reflection had ca&s;t upon
her &s;pirits, opened one of the high ca&s;e|ments,
and was again cheered by the face
of living nature. The &s;hadowy earth,
the air, and ocean&mdash;all was &s;till. Along
the deep &s;erene of the heavens, a few
light clo$ds floated &s;lowly, through who&s;e
&s;kirts the &s;tars now &s;eemed to tremble,
and now to emerge with purer &s;plendour.
Blanche's thoughts aro&s;e involuntarily to
the Great Author of the &s;ublime objects
&s;he contemplated, and &s;he breathed a
prayer of finer devotion, than any &s;he had
ever uttered beneath the vaulted roof of
a cloi&s;ter. At this ca&s;ement, &s;he remained
till the glooms of midnight were &s;tretched
over the pro&s;pect. She then retired to
<PB N="366" REF="368">
her pillow, and, &startq;with gay vi&s;ions of to|morrow,&endq;
to tho&s;e &s;weet &s;lumbers, which
health and happy innocence only know.</P>
<Q>&startq;To-morrow $o &s;re&s;h woods and pa&s;tures new.&endq;</Q>

<P>BLANCHE's &s;lumbers continued, till
long after the hour, which &s;he had &s;o im|patiently
anticipated, for her woman, fa|tigued
with travelling, did not call her,
till breakfa&s;t was nearly ready. Her di&s;|appointment,
however, was in&s;tantly for|gotten,
when, on opening the ca&s;ement,
&s;he &s;aw, on one hand, the wide &s;ea &s;park|ling
in the morning rays, with its &s;tealing
&s;ails and glancing oars; and, on the other,
the fre&s;h woods, the plains far-&s;tretching
and the blue mountains, all glowing with
the &s;plendour of day.</P>
<P>As &s;he in&s;pired the pure breeze, health
<PB N="368" REF="370">
&s;pread a deeper blu&s;h upon her counte|nance,
and plea&s;ure danced in her eyes.
&startq;Who could fir&s;t invent convents!&endq;
&s;aid &s;he, &startq;and who could fir&s;t per&s;uade
people to go into them? and to make re|ligion
a pretence, too, where all that
&s;hould in&s;pire it, is &s;o carefully &s;hut out!
God is be&s;t plea&s;ed with the homage of a
grateful heart, and, when we view his
glories, we feel mo&s;t grateful. I never
felt &s;o much devotion, during the many
dull years I was in the convent, as. I have
done in the few hours, that I have been
here, where I need only look on all around
me&mdash;to adore God in my inmo&s;t heart!&endq;</P>
<P>Saying this, &s;he left the window, bound|ed
along the gallery, and, in the next mo|ment,
was in the breakfa&s;t$room, where
the Count was already &s;eated. The cheer|fulne&s;s
of a bright &s;un&s;hine had di&s;per&s;ed
the melancholy glooms of his reflections,
a plea&s;ant &s;mile was on his countenance,
and he &s;poke in an enlivening voice to
Blanche, who&s;e heart echoed back the
<PB N="369" REF="371">
tones. Henri and, &s;oon after, the Coun|te&s;s
with Mademoi&s;elle Bearn appeared,
and the whole party &s;eemed to acknow|ledge
the influence of the &s;cene, even the
Counte&s;s was &s;o much re-animated as to
receive the civilities of her hu&s;band with
complacency, and but once forgot her
good-humour, which was when &s;he a&s;ked
whether they had any neighbours, who
were likely to make <HI>this barbarous &s;pot</HI>
more tolerable, and whether the Count
believed it po&s;&s;ible for her to exi&s;t here,
without &s;ome amu&s;ement?&endq;</P>
<P>Soon after breakfa&s;t the party di&s;per&s;ed;
the Count, ordering his &s;teward to attend
him in the library, went to &s;urvey the con|dition
of his premi&s;es, and to vi&s;it &s;ome of
his tenants; Henri ha&s;tened with alacrity
to the &s;hore to examine a boat, that was to
bear them on a little vovage in the evening
and to &s;uperintend the adju&s;tment of a &s;ilk
awning; while the Counte&s;s, attended by
Mademoi&s;elle Bearn, retired to an apart|ment
on the modern &s;ide of the chateau,
<PB N="370" REF="372">
which was fitted up with airy elegance;
and, as the windows opened upon balco|nies,
that fronted the &s;ea, &s;he was there
&s;aved from a view of the <HI>horrid</HI> Pyren&eacute;es.
Here, while &s;he reclined on a &s;ofa, and,
ca&s;ting her languid eyes over the ocean,
which appearrd beyond the wood-tops,
indulged in the luxuries of <HI>ennui,</HI> her com|panion.
read aloud a &s;entimental novel,
on &s;ome fa&s;hionable &s;y&s;tem of philo&s;ophy,
for the Counte&s;s was her&s;elf &s;omewhat of a
<HI>philo&s;opher,</HI> e&s;pecially as to <HI>infidelity,</HI> and
among a certain circle her opinions were
waited for with impatience, and received as
doctrines.</P>
<P>The Lady Blanche, meanwhile, ha&s;tened to
indulge, amid&s;t the wild wood-walks around
the chateau, her new enthu&s;ia&s;m, where,
as &s;he wandered under the &s;hades, her gay
&s;pirits gradually yielded to pen&s;ive com|placency.
Now, &s;he moved with &s;olemn
&s;teps, beneath the gloom of thickly inter|woven
branches, where the fre&s;h dew &s;till
hung upon every flower, that peeped from
<PB N="371" REF="373">
among the gra&s;s; and now tripped &s;por|tively
along the path, on which the &s;un|beams
darted and the checquered foliage
trembled&mdash;where the tender greens of the
beech, the acacia and the mountain$a&s;h,
mingling with the &s;olemn tints of the
cedar, the pine and cypre&s;s, exhibited as
fine a contra&s;t of colouring, as the maje&s;tic
oak and oriental plane did of form, to the
feathery lightne&s;s of the cork tree and the
waving grace of the poplar.</P>
<P>Having reached a ru&s;tic &s;eat, within a
deep rece&s;s of the woods, &s;he re&s;ted awhile,
and, as her eyes caught, through a di&s;tant
opening, a glimp&s;e of the blue waters of the
Mediterranean, with the white &s;ail, gliding
on its bo&s;om, or of the broad mountain,
glowing beneath the mid-day &s;un, her
mind experienced &s;omewhat of that exqui|&s;ite
delight, which awakens the fancy, and
leads to poetry. The hum of bees alone
broke the &s;tillne&s;s around her, as, with
other in$ects of various hues, they &s;ported
gaily in the &s;hade, or &s;ipped &s;weets from
<PB N="372" REF="374">
the fre&s;h flowers; and, while Blanche
watched a butter-fly, flitting from bud to
bud, &s;he indulged her&s;elf in imagining
the plea&s;ures of its &s;hort day, till &s;he had com|po&s;ed
the following &s;tanzas.</P>

When Lady Blanche returned to the cha|teau,
in&s;tead of going to the apartment of
the Counte&s;s, &s;he amu&s;ed her&s;elf with wan|dering
over that part of the edifice, which
&s;he had not yet examined, of which the
mo&s;t antient fir&s;t attracted her curio&s;ity;
for, though what &s;he had &s;een of the mo|dern
was gay and elegant, there was &s;ome|thing
in the former more intere&s;ting to her
imagination. Having pa&s;&s;ed up the great
&s;tair-ca&s;e, and through the oak gallery, &s;he
entered upon a long &s;uite of chambers,
who&s;e walls were either hung with tape&s;try,
or wain&s;coted with cedar, the furniture of
which looked almo&s;t as antient as the rooms
them&s;elves; the &s;pacious fire-places, where
no mark of &s;ocial cheer remained, pre|&s;ented
an image of cold de&s;olation; and
the whole &s;uite had &s;o much the air of
neglect and de&s;ertion, that it &s;eemed, as if
the venerable per&s;ons, who&s;e portraits hung
upon the walls, had been the la&s;t to inha|bit
them.</P>
<P>On leaving the&s;e rooms, &s;he found her|&s;elf
<PB N="376" REF="378">
in another gallery, one end of which
was terminated by a back &s;tair-ca&s;e, and
the other by a door, that &s;eemed to com|municate
with the north-&s;ide of the cha|teau,
but which being fa&s;tened, &s;he de|&s;cended
the &s;tair-ca&s;e, and, opening a door
in the wall, a few &s;teps down, found her|&s;elf
in a &s;mall &s;quare room, that formed
part of the we&s;t turret of the ca&s;tle. Three
windows pre&s;ented each a &s;eparate and
beautiful pro&s;pect; that to the north, over|looking
Languedoc; another to the we&s;t,
the hills a&s;cending towards the Pyren&eacute;s,
who&s;e awful &s;ummits crowned the land|&s;cape;
and a third, fronting the &s;outh, gave
the Mediterranean, and a part of the wild
&s;hores of Rou&s;illon, to the eye.</P>
<P>Having left the turret, and de&s;cended
the narrow &s;tair-ca&s;e, &s;he found her&s;elf in
a du&s;ky pa&s;&s;age, where &s;he wandered, un|able
to find her way, till impatience yield|ed
to apprehen&s;ion, and &s;he called for a&s;|&s;i&s;tance.
Pre&s;ently &s;teps approached, and
light glimmered through a door at the
<PB N="377" REF="379">
other extremity of the pa&s;&s;age, which was
opened with caution by &s;ome per&s;on, who
did not venture beyond it, and whom
Blanche ob&s;erved in &s;ilence, till the door
was clo&s;ing, when &s;he called aloud, and,
ha&s;tening towards it, perceived the old
hou&s;ekeeper.</P>
<P>&startq;Dear ma'am&s;elle! is it you?&endq; &s;aid
Doroth&eacute;e, &startq;How could you find your
way hither?&endq; Had Blanche been le&s;s oc|cupied
by her own fears, &s;he would pro|bably
have ob&s;erved the &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions
of terror and &s;urpri&s;e on Doroth$e's conn|tenance,
who now led her through a long
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of pa&s;&s;ages and rooms, that
looked as if they had been uninhabited
for a century, till they reached that ap|propriated
to the hou&s;ekeeper, where Do|roth$e
entreated &s;he would &s;it down and
take refre&s;hment. Blanche accepted the
&s;weet meats, offered to her, mentioned her
di&s;covery of the plea&s;ant turret, and her
wi&s;h to appropriate it to her own u&s;e.
Whether Doroth&eacute;e's ta&s;te was not &s;o &s;en|&s;ible
<PB N="378" REF="380">
to the beauties of land&s;cape as her
young lady's, or that the con&s;tant view of
lovely &s;cenery had deadened it, &s;he for|bore
to prai&s;e the &s;ubject of Blanche's en|thu&s;ia&s;m,
which, however, her &s;ilence did
not repre&s;s. To Lady Blanche's enquiry,
of whither the door &s;he had found fa&s;tened
at the end of the gallery led, &s;he replied,
that it opened to a &s;uite of rooms, which
had not been entered, during many years,
&startq;For,&endq; added &s;he, &startq;my late lady died
in one of them, and I could never find in
my heart to go into them &s;ince.&endq;</P>
<P>Blanche, though &s;he wi&s;hed to &s;ee the&s;e chambers, forbore, on ob&s;erving that Do|roth&eacute;e's
eyes were filled with tears, to a&s;k
her to unlock them, and, &s;oon after, went
to dre&s;s for dinner, at which the whole
party met in good &s;pirits and good hu|mour,
except the Counte&s;s, who&s;e vacant
mind, overcome by the languor of idle|ne&s;s,
would neither &s;uffer her to be happy
her&s;elf, or to contribute to the happine&s;s
of others. Mademoi&s;elle Bearm, attempt|ing
<PB N="379" REF="381">
to be witty, directed her <HI>badinage</HI>
again&s;t Henri, who an&s;wered, becau&s;e
he could not well avoid it, rather than
from any inclination to notice her, who&s;e
liveline&s;s &s;ometimes amu&s;ed, but who&s;e
conceit and in&s;en&s;ibility often di&s;gu&s;ted
him.</P>
<P>The cheerfulne&s;s, with which Blanche
rejoined the party, vani&s;hed, on her
reaching the margin of the &s;ea; &s;he gazed
with apprehen&s;ion upon the immen&s;e ex|pan&s;e
of waters, which, at a di&s;tance, &s;he
had beheld only with delight and a&s;to|ni&s;hment,
and it was by a &s;trong effort,
that &s;he &s;o far overcame her fears as to fol|low
her father into the boat.</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;ilently &s;urveyed the va&s;t hori|zon,
bending round the di&s;tant verge of
the ocean, an emotion of &s;ublime&s;t rap|ture
&s;truggled to overcome a &s;en&s;e of per|&s;onal
danger. A light breeze played on
the water, and on the &s;ilk awning of the
boat, and waved the foliage of the reced|ing
<PB N="380" REF="382">
woods, that crowned the cliffs, for
many miles, and which the Count &s;ur|veyed
with the pride of con&s;cious property,
as well as with the eye of ta&s;te.</P>
<P>At &s;ome di&s;tance, among the&s;e woods,
&s;tood a pavilion, which had once been the
&s;cene of &s;ocial gaiety, and which its &s;itua|tion$
&s;till made one of romantic beauty.
Thither, the Count had ordered coffee and
other refre&s;hment to be carried, and thi|ther
the &s;ailors now &s;teered their cour&s;e,
following the windings of the &s;hore round
many a woody promontory and circling
bay; while the pen&s;ive tones of horns and
other wind in&s;truments, played by the at|tendants
in a di&s;tant boat, echoeda mong
the rocks, and died along the waves.
Blanche had now &s;ubdued her fears; a
delightful tranquillity &s;tole over her mind,
and held her in &s;ilence; and &s;he was too
happy even to remember the convent, or
her former &s;orrows, as &s;ubjects of com|pari&s;on
with her pre&s;ent felicity.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="383">
The Counte&s;s felt le&s;sunhappy than &s;he
had done, &s;ince the moment of her leav|ing
Paris; for her mind was now under
&s;ome degree of re&s;traint; &s;he feared to in|dulge
its wayward humours, and even
wi&s;hed to recover the Count's good opi|nion.
On his family, and on the &s;urround|ing
&s;cene, he looked with tempered plea|&s;ure
and benevolent &s;atisfaction, while his
&s;on exhibited the gay &s;pirits of youth, an|ticipating
new delights, and regretle&s;s of
tho&s;e, that were pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>After near an hour's rowing, the party
landed, and a&s;cended a little path, over|grown
with vegetation. At a little di&s;tance
from the point of the eminence, within the
&s;hadowy rece&s;s of the woods, appeared the
pavilion, which Blanche perceived, as &s;he
caught a glimp&s;e of its portico between
the trees, to be built of variegated marble.
As &s;he followed the Counte&s;s, &s;he often,
turned her eyes with rapture towards the
ocean, &s;een beneath the dark foliage, far
below, and from thence upon the deep
<PB N="382" REF="384">
woods, who&s;e &s;ilence and impenetrable
gloom awakened emotions more &s;olemn,
but &s;carcely le&s;s delightful</P>
<P>The pavilion had been prepared, as far
as was po&s;&s;ible, on a very &s;hort notice, for
the reception of its vi&s;itors; but the faded
colours of its painted walls and ceiling,
and the decayed drapery of its once mag|nificent
furniture, declared how long it
had been neglected, and abandoned to
the empire of the changing &s;ea&s;ons. While
the party partook of a collation of fruit
and coffee, the horns, placed in a di&s;tant
part of the woods, where an echo &s;weetened
and prolonged their melancholy tones,
broke &s;oftly on the &s;tillne&s;s of the &s;cene.
This &s;pot &s;eemed to attract even the admi|ration
of the Counte&s;s, or, perhaps, it was
merely the plea&s;ure of planning furniture
and decorations, that made her dwell &s;o
long on the nece&s;&s;ity of repairing and
adorning it; while the Count, never hap|pier
than when he &s;aw her mind engaged
by natural and &s;imple objects, acquie&s;ced
<PB N="383" REF="385">
in all her de&s;igns, concerning the pavilion.
The paintings on the walls and coved
ceiling were to be renewed, the canopies
and &s;ofas were to be of light green da|ma&s;k;
marble &s;tatues of wood-nymphs,
bearing on their heads ba&s;kets of living
flowers, were to adorn the rece&s;&s;es between
the windows, which, de&s;cending to the
ground, were to admit to every part of
the room, and it was of octagonal form,
the various land&s;cape. One window open|ed
upon a romantic glade, where the eye
roved among woody rece&s;&s;es, and the &s;cene
was bounded only by a lengthened pomp
of groves; from another, the woods reced|ing
di&s;clo&s;ed the di&s;tant &s;ummits of the
Pyren&eacute;es; a third fronted an avenue, be|yond
which the grey towers of Chateau|te-Blanc,
and a picture$que part of its ruin
were &s;een partially among the foliage;
while a fourth gave, between the trees, a
glimp&s;e of the green pa&s;tures and villages,
that diver&s;ify the banks of the Aude. The
Mediterranean, with the bold cliffs, that
<PB N="384" REF="386">
overlooked its &s;hores, were the grand ob|jects
of a fifth window, and the others
gave, in different points of view, the wild
&s;cenery of the woods.</P>
<P>After wandering, for &s;ome time, in the&s;e,
the party returned to the &s;hore and em|barked;
and, the beauty of the evening
tempting them to extend their excur&s;ion,
they proceeded further up the bay. A
dead calm had &s;ucceeded the light breeze,
that wafted them, hither, and the men took
to their oars. Around, the waters were
&s;pread into one va&s;t expan&s;e of poli&s;hed
mirror, reflecting the grey cliffs and fea|thery
woods, that over-hung its &s;urface, the
glow of the we&s;tern horizon and the dark
clouds, that came &s;lowly from the ea&s;t.
Blanche loved to &s;ee the dipping oars im|print
the water, and to watch the &s;pread|ing
circles they left, which gave a tremu|lous
motion to the reflected land&s;cape,
without de&s;troying the harmony of its
features.</P>
<P>Above the darkne&s;s of the woods, her
<PB N="385" REF="387">
eye now caught a clu&s;ter of high towers,
touched with the &s;plendour of the &s;etting
rays; and, &s;oon after, the horns being then,
&s;ilent, &s;he heard the faint &s;well of choral
voices from a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>&startq;What voices are tho&s;e, upon the air?&endq;
&s;aid the Count, looking round, and li&s;ten|ing;
but the &s;train had cea&s;ed. &startq;It &s;eem|ed
to be a ve&s;per-hymn, which I have often
heard in my convent,&endq; &s;aid Blanche.</P>
<P>&startq;We are near the mona&s;tery, then,&endq;
ob&s;erved the Count; and, the boat &s;oon
after doubling a lofty head-land, the mo|na&s;tery
of St. Claire appeared, &s;eated near the margin of the &s;ea, where the cliffs,
&s;uddenly &s;inking, formed a low &s;hore with|in
a &s;mall bay, almo&s;t encircled with
woods, among which partial features of the
edifice were &s;een;&mdash;the great gate and
gothic window of the hall, the cloi&s;ters
and the &s;ide of a chapel more remote;
while a venerable arch, which had once
led to a part of the fabric, now demoli&s;hed,
&s;tood a maje&s;tic ruin detached from the
<PB N="386" REF="388">
main building, beyond which appeared a
grand per&s;pective of the woods. On the
grey walls, the mo&s;s had fa&s;tened, and,
round the pointed windows of the chapel,
the ivy and the briony hung in many a
fanta&s;tic wreath.</P>
<P>All without was &s;ilent and for&s;aken;
but, while Blanche gazed with admiration
on this venerable pile, who&s;e effect was
heightened by the &s;trong lights and &s;ha|dows
thrown athwart it by a cloudy &s;un|&s;et,
a &s;ound of many voices, &s;lowly chant|ing,
aro&s;e from within. The Count bade
his men re&s;t on their oars. The monks
were &s;inging the hymn of ve&s;pers, and
&s;ome female voices mingled with the &s;train,
which, ro&s;e by &s;oft degrees, till the high
organ and the choral &s;ounds&s;welled into
full and &s;olemn harmony. The &s;train,
&s;oon after, dropped into &s;udden &s;ilence, and
was renewed in a low and &s;till more &s;o|lemn
key, till, at length, the holy chorus
died away, and was heard no more.&mdash;
Blanche &s;ighed, tears trembled in her eyes,
<PB N="387" REF="389">
and her thoughts &s;eemed wafted with the
founds to heaven. While a rapt &s;tillne&s;s
prevailed in the boat, a train of friars, and
then of nuns, veiled in white, i&s;&s;ued from
the cloi&s;ters, and pa&s;&s;ed, under the &s;hade
of the woods, to the main body of the edi|fice.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s was the fir&s;t of her party
to awaken from this pau&s;e of &s;ilence.</P>
<P>&startq;The&s;e di&s;mal hymns and friars make
one quite melancholy,&endq; &s;aid &s;he; &startq;twi|light
is coming on; pray let us return, or
it will be dark before we get home.&endq;</P>
<P>The Count, looking up, now perceived,
that the twilight of evening was anticipated
by an approaching &s;torm. In the ea&s;t a
tempe&s;t was collecting; a heavy gloom
came on, oppo&s;ing and contra&s;ting the
glowing &s;plendour of the &s;etting &s;un. The
clamorous &s;ea-fowl &s;kimmed in &s;leet cir|cles
upon the &s;urface of the &s;ea, dipping
their light pinions in the wave, as they fled
away in &s;earch of &s;helter. The boatmen
pulled hard at their oars; but the thunder,
<PB N="388" REF="390">
that now muttered at a di&s;tance, and the
heavy drops, that began to dimple the water,
made the Count determine to put back to
the mona&s;tery for &s;helter, and the cour&s;e
of the boat was immediately changed. As
the clouds approached the we&s;t, their lurid
darkne&s;s changed to a deep ruddy glow,
which, by reflection, &s;eemed to fire the
tops of the woods and the &s;hattered towers
of the mona&s;tery.</P>
<P>The appearance of the heavens alarmed
the Counte&s;s and Mademoi&s;elle Bearn,
who&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of apprehen&s;ion di&s;tre&s;&s;ed
the Count, and perplexed his men; while
Blanche continued &s;ilent, now agitated
with fear, and now with admiration, as
&s;he viewed the grandeur of the clouds,
and their effect on the &s;cenery, and li&s;tened
to the long, long peals of thunder, that
rolled through the air.</P>
<P>The boat having reached the lawn be|fore
the mona&s;tery, the Count &s;ent a &s;er|vant
to announce his arrival, and to en|treat
&s;helter of the Superior, who, &s;oon
<PB N="389" REF="391">
after, appeared at the great gate, attended
by &s;everal monks, while the &s;ervant return|ed
with a me&s;&s;age, expre&s;&s;ive at once of
ho&s;pitality and pride, but of pride di&s;|gui&s;ed
in &s;ubmi&s;&s;iton. The party imme|diately
di&s;embarked, and, having ha&s;tily
cro&s;&s;ed the lawn&mdash;for the &s;hower was now
heavy&mdash;were received at the gate by the Su|perior,
who, as they entered, &s;tretched forth
his hands and gave his ble&s;&s;ing; and they
pa&s;&s;ed into the great hall, where-the lady
abbe&s;s waited, attended by &s;everal nuns,
clothed, like her&s;elf, in black, and veiled in
white. The veil of the abbe&s;s was, how|ever,
thrown half back, and di&s;covered a
countenance, who&s;e cha&s;te dignity was
&s;weetened by the &s;inite of welcome, with
which &s;he addre&s;&s;ed the Counte&s;s, whom
&s;he led, with Blanche and Mademoi&s;elle
Bearn, into the convent parlour, while the
Count and Henri were conducted by the
Superior to the refectory.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s, fatigued and di&s;content|ed,
received the politene&s;s of the abbe&s;s
<PB N="390" REF="392">
with carele&s;s haughtine&s;s, and had follow|ed
her, with indolent &s;teps, to the parlour,
over which the painted ca&s;ements and wain|&s;cot
of larch-wood threw, at all times, a
melancholy &s;hade, and where the gloom of
evening now loured almo&s;t to darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>While the lady abbe&s;s ordered refre&s;h|ment,
and conver&s;ed with the Counte&s;s,
Blanche withdrew to a window, the lower
panes of which, being without painting, al|lowed
her to ob&s;erve the progre&s;s of the
&s;torm over the Mediterranean, who&s;e dark
waves, that had &s;o lately &s;lept, now came
boldly &s;welling, in long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, to the
&s;hore, where they bur&s;t in white foam, and
threw up a high &s;pray over the rocks. A
red &s;ulphureous tint over&s;pread the long
line of clouds, that hung above the we&s;tern
horizon, beneath who&s;e dark &s;kirts the &s;un
looking out, illumined the di&s;tant &s;hores
of Languedoc, as well as the tufted &s;um|mits
of the nearer woods, and &s;hed a par|tial
gleam on the we|tern
waves. The re&s;t of the &s;cene was in deep gloom, ex|cept
<PB N="391" REF="393">
where a &s;un-beam, darting between
the clouds, glanced on the white wings
of the &s;ea-fowl, that circled high among
them, or touched the &s;welling &s;ail of a
ve&s;&s;el, which was &s;een labouring an the
&s;torm. Blanche, for &s;ome time, anxiou&s;ly
watched the progre&s;s of the bark, as it
threw the waves in foam around it, and, as
the lightnings fla&s;hed, looked to the open|ing
heavens, with many a &s;igh for the fate
of the poor mariners.</P>
<P>The &s;un, at length, &s;et, and the heavy
clouds, which had long impended, drop|ped
over the &s;plendour of his cour&s;e; the
ve&s;&s;el, however, was yet dimly &s;een, and
Blanche continued to ob&s;erve it, till the
quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of fla&s;hes, lighting up
the gloom of the whole horizon, warned
her to retire from the window, and &s;he
joined the Abbe&s;s, who, having exhau&s;ted
all her topics of conver&s;ation with the
Counte&s;s, had now lei&s;ure to notice her.</P>
<P>But their di&s;cour&s;e was interrupted by
tremendous peals of thunder; and the
<PB N="392" REF="394">
bell of the mona&s;tery &s;oon after ringing out,
&s;ummoned the inhabitants to prayer. As
Blanche pa&s;&s;ed the windows, &s;he gave ano|ther
look to the ocean, where, by the mo|mentary
fla&s;h, that illumined the va&s;t body
of the waters, &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed the ve&s;&s;el
&s;he had ob&s;erved before, amid&s;t a &s;ea of
foam, breaking the billows, the ma&s;t now
bowing to the waves, and then ri&s;ing high
in air.</P>
<P>She &s;ighed fervently as &s;he gazed, and
then followed the Lady Abbe&s;s and the
Counte&s;s to the chapel. Meanwhile, &s;ome of
the Count's &s;ervants, having gone by land
to the chateau for carriages, returned &s;oon
after ve&s;pers had concluded, when, the
&s;torm being &s;omewhat abated, the Count
and his family returned home. Blanche
was &s;urpri&s;ed to di&s;cover how much the
windings of the &s;hore had deceived her,
concerning the di&s;tance of the chateau from
the mona&s;tery, who&s;e ve&s;per bell &s;he had
heard, on the preceding evening, from
the windows of the we&s;t &s;aloon, and who&s;e
<PB N="393" REF="395">
towers &s;he would al&s;o have &s;een from
thence, had not twilight veiled them.</P>
<P>On their arrival at the chateau, the
Counte&s;s, affecting more fatigue, than &s;he
really felt, withdrew to her apartment, and
the Count, with his daughter and Henri,
went to&punc; the &s;upper-room, where they had
not been long, when they heard, in a
pau&s;e of the gu&s;t, a firing of guns, which,
the Count under&s;tanding to be &s;ignals of
di&s;tre&s;s from &s;ome ve&s;&s;el in the &s;torm,
went to a window, that opened towards
the Mediterranean, to ob&s;erve further;
but the &s;ea was now involved in utter dark|ne&s;s,
and the loud howlings of the tempe&s;t
had again overcome every other &s;ound.
Blanche, remembering the bark, which
&s;he had before &s;een, now joined her father,
with trembling anxiety. In a few mo|ments,
the report of guns was again borne
along the wind, and as &s;uddenly wafted
away; a tremendous bur&s;t of thunder, fol|lowed
and, in the fla&s;h, that had preceded
it, and which &s;eemed to quiver over the
<PB N="394" REF="396">
Whole &s;urface of the waters, a ve&s;&s;el was
di&s;covered, to&s;&s;ing amid&s;t the white foam
of the waves at &s;ome ci&s;tance from the
&s;hore. Impenetrable darkne&s;s again in|volved
the &s;cene, but &s;oon a &s;econd fla&s;h
&s;hewed the bark, with one &s;ail unfurled,
driving towards the coa&s;t. Blanche hung
upon her father's arm, with looks full of
the agony of united terror and pity, which
were unnece&s;&s;ary to awaken the heart of the
Count, who gazed upon the &s;ea with a pi|teous
expre&s;&s;ion, and, perceiving, that no
boat could live in the &s;torm, forbore to
&s;end one; but he gave orders to his people
to carry torches out upon the cliffs, hoping
they might prove a kind of beacon to the
ve&s;&s;el, or, at lea&s;t, warn the crew of the
rocks they were approaching. While
Henri went out todirect on what part of
the cliffs the lights &s;hould appear, Blanche
remained, with her father, at the window,
catching, every now and then, as the
lightnings fla&s;hed, a glimp&s;e of the ve&s;&s;el;
and &s;he &s;oon &s;aw, with reviving hope, the
<PB N="395" REF="397">
torches flaming on the blackne&s;s of night,
and, as they waved over the cliffs, ca&s;ting
a red gleam on the ga&s;ping billows. When
the firing of guns was repeated, the torches
were to&s;&s;ed high in the air, as if an&s;wer|ing
the &s;ignal, and the firing was then
redoubled; but, though the wind bore
the &s;ound away, &s;he fancied, as the light|nings
glanced, that the ve&s;&s;el was much
nearer the &s;hore.</P>
<P>The Count's &s;ervants were now &s;een,
running to and fro, on the rocks; &s;ome
venturing almo&s;t to the point of the crags,
and bending over, held out their torches
fa&s;tened to long poles; while others, who&s;e
&s;teps could be traced only by the cour&s;e of
the lights, de&s;cended the &s;teep and dange|rous
path, that wound to the margin of
the &s;ea, and, with loud halloos, hailed the
mariners, who&s;e &s;hrill whi&s;tle, and then
feeble voices, were heard, at intervals,
mingling with the &s;torm. Sudden &s;houts
from the people on the rocks increa&s;ed the
anxiety of Blanche to an almo&s;t intolerable
degree: but her &s;u&s;pen&s;e, concerning the
<PB N="396" REF="398">
fate of the mariners, was &s;oon over, when
Henri, running breathle&s;s into the room,
told that the ve&s;&s;el was anchored in the bay
below, but in &s;o &s;hattered a condition,
that it was feared &s;he would part before
the crew could di&s;embark. The Count
immediately gave orders for his own boats
to a&s;&s;i&s;t in bringing them to &s;hore, and
that &s;uch of the&s;e unfortunate &s;trangers as
could not be accommodated in the ad|jacent
hamlet &s;hould be entertained at the
chateau. Among the latter, were Emily
St. Aubert, Mon&s;ieur Du Pont, Ludovico
and Annette, who, having embarked at
Leghorn and reached Mar&s;eilles, were
from thence cro&s;&s;ing the Gulf of Lyons,
when this &s;torm overtook them. They
were received by the Count with his u&s;ual
benignity, who, though Emily wi&s;hed to
have proceeded immediately to the mona&s;|tery
of St. Claire, would not allow her to
leave the chateau, that night; and, indeed,
the terror and fatigue &s;he had &s;uffered
would, &s;carcely have permitted her to go
farther.</P>
<P><PB N="397" REF="399">
In Mon&s;ieur Du Pont the Count di&s;co|vered
an old acquaintance, and much joy
and congratulation pa&s;&s;ed between them,
after which Emily was introduced by name
to the Count's family, who&s;e ho&s;pitable
benevolence di&s;&s;ipated the little embar|ra&s;&s;ment,
which her &s;ituation had occa|&s;ioned
her, and the party were &s;oon &s;eatecl
at the &s;upper-table. The unaffected kind|ne&s;s
of Blanche and the lively joy &s;he ex|pre&s;&s;ed
on the e&s;cape of the &s;trangers, for
whom her pity had been &s;o much intere&s;ted,
gradually revived Emily's languid &s;pirits;
and Du Pont, relieved from his terrors for
her and for him&s;elf, felt the full contra&s;t,
between his late &s;ituation on a dark and tre|mendous
ocean, and his pre&s;ent one, in a
cheerful man&s;ion, where he was &s;urround|ed
with plenty, elegance and &s;miles of
welcome.</P>
<P>Annette, meanwhile, in the &s;ervants'hall,
was telling of all the dangers &s;he had
encountered, and congratulating her&s;elf &s;o
heartily upon her own and Ludovico's escape,
<PB N="398" REF="400">
and on her pre&s;ent comforts, that
&s;he often made all that part of the chateau
ring with merriment and laughter. Ludo|vico's
&s;pirits were as gay as her own, but
he had di&s;cretion enough to re&s;train them,
and tried to check hers, though in vain,
till her laughter, at length, a&s;cended to
<HI>my lady's</HI> chamber, who &s;ent to enquire
what occa&s;ioned &s;o much uproar in the
chateau, and to command &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Emily withdrew early to &s;eek the repo&s;e
&s;he &s;o much required, but her pillow was
long a &s;leeple&s;s one. On this her return
to her native country, many intere&s;ting
remembrances were awakened; all the
events and &s;ufferings &s;he had experienced,
&s;ince &s;he quitted it, came in long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
to her fancy, and were cha&s;ed only by
the image of Valancourt, with whom to
believe her&s;elf once more in the &s;ame land,
after they had been &s;o long, and &s;o di&s;|tantly
&s;eparated, gave her emotions of inde|&s;cribable
joy, but which afterwards yielded
to anxiety and apprehen&s;ion, when &s;he
<PB N="399" REF="401">
con&s;idered the long period, that had
elap&s;ed, &s;ince any letter had pa&s;&s;ed be|tween
them, and how much might have
happened in this interval to affect her fu|ture
peace. But the thought, that Valan|court
might be now no more, or, if living,
might have forgotten her, was &s;o very ter|rible
to her heart, that &s;he would &s;carcely
&s;uffer her&s;elf to pau&s;e upon the po&s;&s;ibility.
She determined to inform him, on the
following day, of her arrival in France,
which it was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible he could
know but by a letter from her&s;elf, and,
after &s;oothing her &s;pirits with the hope of
&s;oon hearing, that he was well, and un|changed
in his affections, &s;he, at length,
&s;unk to repo&s;e.</P>

<Q><L>&startq;Oft woo'd the gleam of Cynthia, &s;ilver-bright,</L>

<P>THE Lady Blanche was &s;o much in|tere&s;ted
for Emily, that, upon hearing &s;he
was going to re&s;ide in the neighbouring
convent, &s;he reque&s;ted the Count would
invite her to lengthen her &s;tay at the cha|teau.
&startq;And you know, my dear &s;ir,&endq;
added Blanche, how delighted I &s;hall
be with &s;uch a companion; for, at pre|&s;ent,
I have no friend to walk, or to read
with, &s;ince Mademoi&s;elle Bearn is my
mamma's friend only.&endq;</P>
<P>The Count &s;miled at the youthful &s;im|plicity,
with which his daughter yielded to
fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions; and, though he cho&s;e to
warn her of their danger, he &s;ilently ap|plauded
the benevolence, that could thus
readily expand in confidence to a &s;tranger.
<PB N="401" REF="403">
He had ob&s;erved Emily, with attention,
on the preceding evening, and was as
much plea&s;ed with her, as it was po&s;&s;ible
he could be with any per&s;on, on &s;o &s;hort
an acquaintance. The mention, made of
her by Mon&s;. Du Pont, had al&s;o given
him a favourable impre&s;&s;ion of Emily;
but, extremely cautious as to tho&s;e, whom
he introduced to the intimacy of his daugh|ter,
he determined, on hearing that the
former was no &s;tranger at the convent of
St. Claire, to vi&s;it the abbe&s;s, and, if her
account corre&s;ponded with his wi&s;h, to in|vite
Emily to pa&s;s &s;ome time at the cha|teau.
On this &s;ubject, he was influenced
by a con&s;ideration of the Lady Blanche's
welfare, &s;till more than by either a wi&s;h
to oblige her, or to befriend the orphan
Emily, for whom, however, he felt con&s;i|derably
interested.</P>
<P>On the following morning, Emily was
too much fatigued to appear; but Mon&s;.
Du &startq;Pont was at the breakfa&s;t- table, when
the Count entered the room, who pre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="402" REF="404">
him, as his former acquaintance, and the
&s;on of a very old friend, to prolong his
&s;tay at the chateau; an invitation, which
Du Pont willingly accepted, &s;ince it would
allow him to be near Emily; and, though
he was not con&s;cious of encouraging a hope,
that &s;he would ever return his affection,
he had not fortitude enough to attempt, at
pre&s;ent, to overcome it.</P>
<P>Emily, when &s;he was &s;omewhat reco|vered,
wandered with her new friend over
the grounds belonging to the chateau, as
much delighted with the &s;urrounding views,
as Blanche, in the benevolence of her
heart, had wi&s;hed; from thence &s;he per|ceived,
beyond the woods, the towers of
the mona&s;tery, and remarked, that it was
to this convent &s;he designed to go.</P>
<P>&startq;Ah!&endq; &s;aid Blanche with &s;urpri&s;e,
&startq;I. am but ju&s;t relea&s;ed from a con|vent,
and would you go into one? If
you could know what plea&s;ure I feel in
wandering here, at liberty,&mdash;and in &s;eeing
the &s;ky and the fields, and the woods all
<PB N="403" REF="405">
round me, I think you would not.&endq;
Emily, &s;miling at the warmth, with which
the Lady Blanche &s;poke, ob&s;erved, that
&s;he did not mean to confine her&s;elf to a
convent for life.</P>
<P>&startq;No, you may not intend it now,&endq;
&s;aid Blanche; &startq;but you do not know to
what the nuns may per&s;uade you to con|&s;ent:
I know how kind they will appear,
and how happy, for I have &s;een too much
of their art.&endq;</P>
<P>When they returned to the chateau,
Lady Blanche conducted Emily to her
favourite turret, and from thence they
rambled through the ancient chambers,
which Blanche had vi&s;ited before. Emily
was amu&s;ed by ob&s;erving the &s;tructure of
the&s;e apartments, and the fa&s;hion of their
old but &s;til1 magnificent furniture, and by
comparing them with tho&s;e of the ca&s;tle
of Udolpho, which were yet more antique
and grote&s;que. She was al&s;o intere&s;ted b
Doroth&eacute;e the hou&s;e-keeper, who attended&punc;
who&s;e appearance was almo&s;t as an|ntique
<PB N="404" REF="406">
as the objects around her, and who
&s;eemed no le&s;s intere&s;ted by Emily, on
whom &s;he frequently gazed with &s;o much
$leep attention, as &s;carcely to hear what
was &s;aid to her.</P>
<P>While Emily looked from one of the
ca&s;ements, &s;he perceived, with &s;urpri&s;e,
&s;ome objects, that were familiar to her me|mory;
&mdash;the fields and woods, with the
gleaming brook, which &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed with
La Voi&s;in, one evening, &s;oon after the
death of Mon&s;ieur Sr. Aubert, in her way
from the mona&s;tery to her cottage; and
&s;he now knew this to be the chateau, which
he had then avoided, and concerning which
he had dropped &s;ome remarkable hints.</P>
<P>Shocked by this di&s;covery, yet &s;carcely
knowing why, &s;he mu&s;ed for &s;ome time in
&s;ilence, and remembered the emotion,
which her father had betrayed on finding
himself &s;o near this man&s;ion, and &s;ome
other circum&s;tances of his conduct, that
now greatly intere&s;ted her. The mu&s;ic,
too, which &s;he had formerly heard, and,
<PB N="405" REF="407">
re&s;pecting which La Voi&s;in had given &s;uch
an odd account, occurred to her, and, de|&s;irous
of knowing more concerning it,
&s;he a&s;ked Doroth&eacute;e whether it returned at mid|night,
as u&s;ual, and whether the mu&s;ician
had yet been di&s;covered.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, ma'am&s;elle,&endq; replied Doroth&eacute;e,
&startq;that mu&s;ic is &s;till heard, but the mu&s;i|cian
has never been found out, nor ever
will, I believe; though there are &s;ome
people, who can gue&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Indeed!&endq; &s;aid Emily, &startq;then why do
they not pur&s;ue the enquiry?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, young lady! enquiry enough has
been made&mdash;but who can pur&s;ue a &s;pirit?&endq;</P>
<P>Emily &s;miled, and, remembering how
lately &s;he had &s;uffered her&s;elf to be led
away by &s;uper&s;tition, determined now to
re&s;i&s;t its contagion; yet, in &s;pight of her
efforts, &s;he felt awe mingle with her curio|&s;ity,
on this &s;ubject; and Blanche, who
had hitherto li&s;tened in &s;ilence, now en|quired
what this mu&s;ic was, and how long
it had been heard.</P>
<P><PB N="406" REF="408">
&startq;Ever &s;ince the death of my lady,

&s;eriou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>&startq;I have heard that mu&s;ic almo&s;t ever

<P>&startq;Do, pray, tell them, then,&endq; &s;aid Lady
Blanche, now more in earne&s;t than in je&s;t.</P>
<P>&startq;I am much intere&s;ted, for I have heard
&s;i&s;ter Henriette, and &s;i&s;ter Sophie, in the
convent, tell of &s;uch &s;trange appearances,
which they them&s;elves had witne&s;&s;ed!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You never heard, my lady, I &s;uppo&s;e,
what made us leave the chateau, and go
and live in a cottage,&endq; &s;aid Doroth&eacute;e.
&startq;Never!&endq; replied Blanche with impatience.</P>
<P>&startq;Nor the rea&s;on, that my lord, the
Marquis&endq;&mdash;Doroth&eacute;e checked her&s;elf, he|&s;itated,
and then endeavoured to change
the topic; but the curio&s;ity of Blanche
was too much awakened to &s;uffer the &s;ub|ject
<PB N="407" REF="409">
thus ea&s;ily to e&s;cape her, and &s;he
pre&s;&s;ed the old hou&s;e-keeper to proceed
with her account, upon whom, however,
no entreaties could prevail; and it was
evident, that &s;he was alarmed for the im|prudence,
into which &s;he had already be|trayed
her&s;elf.</P>
<P>&startq;I perceive,&endq; &s;aid Emily, &s;miling,
that all old man&s;ions are haunted; I am
lately come from a place of wonders; but
unluckily, &s;ince I left it, I have heard al|mo&s;t
all of them explained.&endq;</P>
<P>Blanche was &s;ilent; Doroth&eacute;e looked
grave, and &s;ighed; and Emily felt her&s;elf
&s;till inclined to believe more of the won|derful,
than &s;he cho&s;e to acknowledge.
Ju&s;t then, &s;he remembered the &s;pectacle
&s;he had witne&s;&s;ed in a chamber of Udolpho,
and, by an odd kind of coincidence, the
alarming words, that had accidentally met
her eye in the MS. papers, which &s;he had
de&s;troyed, in obedience to the command
of her father; and &s;he &s;huddered at the
meaning they &s;eemed to impart, almo&s;t as
<PB N="408" REF="410">
much as at the horrible appearance, di&s;|clo&s;ed
by the black veil.</P>
<P>The Lady Blanche, meanwhile, unable
to prevail with Doroth&eacute;e to explain the
&s;ubject of her late hints, had de&s;ired, on
reaching the door, that terminated the gal|lery,
and which &s;he found fa&s;tened on
the preceding day, to &s;ee the &s;uite of rooms
beyond. &startq;Dear young lady,&endq; &s;aid the
hou&s;ekeeper, &endq; I have told you my rea&s;on
for not opening them; I have never &s;een
them, &s;ince my dear lady died; and it
would go hard with me to &s;ee them now.
Pray, madam, do not a&s;k me again &endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Certainly 1 will not,&endq; replied Blanche,
&startq;if that is really your objection.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Alas! it is,&endq; &s;aid the old woman:
we all loved her well, and I &s;hall always
grieve for her. Time runs round! it is
now many years, &s;ince &s;he died; but I re|member
every thing, that happened then,
as if it was but ye&s;terday. Many things,
that have-pa&s;&s;ed of late years, are gone
quite from my memory, while tho&s;e &s;o
<PB N="409" REF="411">
long ago, I can &s;ee as if in a gla&s;s.&endq; She
pau&s;ed, but afterwards, as they walked up
the gallery, added of Emily, &startq;This young
lady &s;ometimes brings the late Marchione&s;s
to my mind; I can remember, when &s;he
looked ju&s;t as blooming, and very like her,
when &s;he &s;miles. Poor lady! how gay
&s;he was, when &s;he fir&s;t came to the cha|teau!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And was &s;he not gay, afterwards?&endq;
&s;aid Blanche.</P>
<P>Doroth&eacute;e &s;hook her head; and Emily
ob&s;erved her, with eyes &s;trongly expre&s;|&s;ive
of the intere&s;t &s;he now felt. &startq;Let
us &s;it down in this window,&endq; &s;aid the Lady
Blanche, on reaching the oppo&s;ite end of
the gall&egrave;ry: &startq;and pray, Doroth&eacute;e, if it is
not painful to you, tell us &s;omething more
about the Marchione&s;s. I &s;hould like to
look into the gla&s;s you &s;poke of ju&s;t now,
and &s;ee a few of the circum&s;tances, which
you &s;ay often pa&s;s over it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, my lady,&endq; replied Doroth&eacute;e;
&startq;if you knew as much as I do, you would
<PB N="410" REF="412">
not, for you would find there a di&s;mal
train of them; I often wi&s;h I could &s;hut
them out, but they will ri&s;e to my mind.
I &s;ee my dear lady on her death-bed,&mdash;her
very look,&mdash;and remember all &s;he &s;aid&mdash;it
was a terrible, &s;cene!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why was it &s;o terrible?&endq; &s;aid Emily
with emotion.</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, dear young lady! is not death
always terrible?&endq; replied Doroth&eacute;e.</P>
<P>To &s;ome further enquiries of Blanche
Doroth$e was &s;ilent; and Emily, ob&s;erving
the tears in her eyes, forbore to urge the
&s;ubject, and endeavoured to withdraw the
attention of her young friend to &s;ome ob|ject
in the gardens, where the Count, with
the Counte&s;s and Mon&s;ieur Du Pont, ap|pearing,
they went down to join them.</P>
<P>When he perceived Emily, he advanced
to meet her, and pre&s;ented her to the
Counteis, in a manner &s;o benign, that it
recalled mo&s;t powerfully to her mind the
idea of her late father, and &s;he felt more
gratitude to him, than embarra&s;&s;ment to|wards
<PB N="411" REF="413">
the Counte&s;s, who, however, receiv|ed
her with one of tho&s;e fa&s;cinating &s;miles,
which her caprice &s;ometimes allowed her
to a&s;&s;ume, and which were now the re&s;ult
of a conver&s;ation the Count had held with
her, concerning Emily. Whatever this
might be, or whatever had pa&s;&s;ed in his
conver&s;ation with the lady abbe&s;s, whom
he had ju&s;t vi&s;ited, e&s;teem and kindne&s;s
were &s;trongly apparent in his manner,
when he addre&s;&s;ed Emily, who experienced
that &s;weet emotion, which ari&s;es from the
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the approbation
of the good; for to the Count's worth &s;he
had been inclined to yield her confidence
almo&s;t from the fir&s;t moment, in which &s;he
had &s;een him.</P>
<P>Before &s;he could fini&s;h her acknowledg|ments
for the ho&s;pitality &s;he had received,
and mention, her de&s;ign of going imme|diately
to the convent, &s;he was interrupted
by an invitation to lengthen her &s;tay at the
chateau, which was pre&s;&s;ed by the Count and the
with, an appearance of
<PB N="412" REF="414">
&s;uch friendly &s;incerity, that, though &s;he
much wi&s;hed to &s;ee her old friends at the
mona&s;tery, and to &s;igh, once more, over
her father's grave, &s;he con&s;ented to remain
a few days at the chateau.</P>
<P>To the abbe&s;s, however, &s;he immedi|ately
wrote, mentioning her arrival in
Languedoc and her wi&s;h to be received
into the convent, as a boarder; &s;he al&s;o
&s;ent letters to Mon&s;ieur Que&s;nel and to
Valancourt, whom &s;he merely informed of
her arrival in France; and, as &s;he knew
not where the latter might be &s;tationed,
&s;he directed her letter to his brother's &s;eat
in Ga&s;cony.'</P>
<P>In the evening, Lady Blanche and Monf.
Du Pont walked with Emily to the cottage
of La Voifin, which &s;he had now a melan|choly
plea&s;ure in approaching, for time
had &s;oftened her grief for the lo&s;s of St.
Aubert, though it could not annihilate it,
and &s;he felt a &s;oothing &s;adne&s;s in indulg|ing
the recollections, which this &s;cene re|called.
La Voi&s;in was &s;till living, and
<PB N="413" REF="415">
&s;eemed to enjoy, as much as formerly, the
tranquil evening of a blamele&s;s life. He
was &s;itting at the door of his cottage,
watching &s;ome of his grand-children, play|ing
on the gra&s;s before him, and, now and
then, with a laugh, or a commendation,
encouraging their &s;ports. He immediately
recollected Emily, whom he was much
plea&s;ed to &s;ee, and &s;he was as rejoiced
to hear, that he had not lo&s;t one of his fa|mily,
&s;ince her departure.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, ma'am&s;elle,&endq; &s;aid the old man,
&startq;we all live merrily together &s;till, thank
God! and I believe there is not a happier
family to be found in Languedoc, than
ours.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily did not tru&s;t her&s;elf in the cham|ber,
where St. Aubert died; and, after
half an hour's conver&s;ation with La Voi&s;in
and his. family, &s;he left the cottage.</P>
<P>During the&s;e the fir&s;t days of her &s;tay at
Chateau; le-Blanc, &s;he was often affected,
by ob&s;erving the deep, but &s;ilent melan|choly,
which, at times, &s;tole over Du Pont;
<PB N="414" REF="416">
and Emily pitying the &s;elf-delu&s;ion, which
di&s;arrned him of the will to depart, de|termined
to withdraw her&s;elf as &s;oon as the
re&s;pect &s;he owed the Count and Gounte&s;s
De Ville&s;ort would permit. The dejection
of his friend &s;oon alarmed the anxiety of
the Count, to whom Du Pont, at length,
confided the &s;ecret of his hopele&s;s affec|tion,
which, however, the former could
only cormmi&s;erate, though he &s;ecretly de|termined
to befriend his &s;uit, if an oppor|tunity
of doing &s;o &s;hould ever occur. Con|fidering
the dangerous &s;ituation of Du
Pont, he but feebly oppo&s;ed his intention
of leaving Chateau-le-Blanc, on the fol|lowing
day, but drew from him a promi&s;e
of a longer vi&s;it, when he could return
with &s;afety to his peace. Emily her&s;elf,
though &s;he could not encourage his affec|tion,
e&s;teemed him both for the many vir|tues
he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and for the &s;ervices &s;he
had received from him; and it was not without tender emotions of gratitude and
pity, that the now &s;aw him depart for his
<PB N="415" REF="417">
famiy &s;eat in Ga&s;cony; while he took
leave of her with a countenance &s;o expre&s;|&s;ive
of love and grief, as to intere&s;t the
Count more warmly in his. cau&s;e than be|fore.
In a few days, Emily al&s;o left the cha|teau,
but not before the Count and Coun|te&s;s
had received her promi&s;e to repeat her
vi&s;it very &s;oon; and &s;he was welcomed by
the abbe&s;s, with the &s;ame maternal kindne&s;s
&s;he had formerly experienced, and by the
nuns, with much expre&s;&s;ion of regard. The
well-known &s;cenes of the convent occa|&s;ioned
her many melancholy recollections, but with the&s;e were mingled-others, that
in&s;pired gratitude for having e&s;caped the
various dangers, that had pur&s;ued her,
&s;ince &s;he quitted it, and for the good,
which &s;he yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and, though &s;he
once more wept over her father's grave,
with tears of tender affection, her grief was
&s;o&s;tened from its former acutene&s;s.</P>
<P>Some time after her return to the monat|&s;tery,
<PB N="416" REF="418">
&s;he received a letter from her uncle,
Monf. Que&s;nel, in an&s;wer to information
that &s;he had arrived in France, and to
her enquiries, concerning &s;uch of her af|fairs
as he had undertaken to conduct dur|ing
her ab&s;ence, e&s;pecially as to the period
for which La Vall&eacute;e had been let, whither
it was her with to return, if it &s;hould ap|pear,
that her income would permit her to
do &s;o. The reply of Monf. Que&s;nel was
cold and formal, as &s;he expected, expre&s;&s;|ing
neither concern for, the evils &s;he &s;u&s;fered,
nor-plea&s;ure, that &s;he was now re|moved
from them; nor did he allow the
opportunity to pa&s;s, of reproving her for her rejection of Count Morano, whom he
affected &s;till to believe a man of honour
and fortune; nor of vehemently declaim|ing
again&s;t Montoni, to whom he had al|ways,
till now, felt him&s;elf to be inferior.
On Emily's pecuniary concerns, he was not
very explicit; he informed her, however, that the term, for which La Vall&eacute;e liad
<PB N="417" REF="419">
been engaged, was nearly expired; but, without inviting her to his own hou&s;e, added, that her circum&s;tances would by no means allow her to re&s;ide there, and ear|neftly
advi&s;ed her to remain, for the pre|&s;ent,
in the convent of St. Claire.</P>
<P>To her enquiries, re&s;pecting poor old There&s;a, her late father's &s;ervant, he gave
no an&s;wer. In the po&s;t&s;cript to his letter, Mon&s;ieur Que&s;nel mentioned M. Motte|ville,
in who&s;e hands the late St. Aubert had placed the chief of his per&s;onal pro|perty,
as being likely to arrange his affairs nearly to the &s;atisfaction of his creditors,
and that Emily would recover much more
of her fortune, than &s;he had formerly rea|&s;on to expect. The letter al&s;o inclo&s;ed to
Emily an order upon a merchant at Nar|bonne,
for a &s;mall &s;um of money.</P>
<P>The tranquillity of the mona&s;tery, and the liberty &s;he was &s;uffered to enjoy, in
wandering among the woods and &s;hores of
this delightful province, gradually re&s;tored
<PB N="418" REF="420">
her &s;pirits to their natural tone, except
that anxiety would &s;ometimes intrude,
concerning Valancourt, as the time ap|proached,
when it was po&s;&s;ible that &s;he
might receive an an&s;wer to her letter.</P>

<P>THE Lady Blanche, meanwhile, who
was left much alone, became impatient
for the company of her new friend, whom
&s;he wi&s;hed to ob&s;erve &s;haring in the de|light
&s;he received from the beautiful &s;cen|ery
around. She had now no per&s;on, to
whom &s;he could expre&s;s her admiration
and coommunicate her plea&s;ures, no eye,
that &s;parkled to her &s;mile, or countenance,
that reflected her happine&s;s; and &s;he be|came
&s;piritle&s;s and pen&s;ive. The Count,
ob&s;erving her di&s;&s;ati&s;faction readily yield|ed
to her entreaties, and reminded Emily
of her promi&s;ed vi&s;it but the &s;ilence of
<PB N="420" REF="422">
Valancourt, which was now prolonged far
beyond the period, when a letter might
have arrived from E&s;tuviere, oppre&s;&s;ed
Emily with &s;evere anxiety, and, rendering
her aver&s;e to &s;ociety, &s;he would willingly
have deferred her acceptance of this invi|tation,
till her &s;pirits &s;hould be relieved.
The Count and his family, however, pre&s;|&s;ed
to &s;ee her; and, as the circum&s;tances,
that prompted her wi&s;h for &s;olitude, could
not be explained, there was an appearance
of caprice in her refu&s;al, which &s;he could
not per&s;evere in, without offending the
friends, who&s;e e&s;teem &s;he valued. At
length, therefore, &s;he returned upon a &s;e|cond
vi&s;it to Chateau-le-Blanc. Here the
friendly manner of Count De Villefort en|couraged
Emily to mention to him her &s;itu|ation,
re&s;pecting the e&s;tates of her late
aunt, and to con&s;ult him on the means of
recovering them. He had little doubt,
that the law would decide in her favour,
and, advi&s;ing her to apply to it, offered
fir&s;t to write to an advocate at Avignon,
<PB N="421" REF="423">
on who&s;e opinion he thought he could
rely. His kindne&s;s was gratefully accepted by Emily, who, &s;oothed by the courte&s;y &s;he
daily experienced, would have been once
more happy, could &s;he have been a&s;&s;ured
of Valancourt's welfare and unaltered af|fection.
She had now been above a week
at the chateau, without receiving intelli|gence
of him, and, though &s;he knew, that,
if he was ab&s;ent from his brother's re&s;idence,
it was &s;carcely probable her letter had yet
reached him, &s;he could not forbear to ad|mit
doubts and fears, that de&s;troyed her
peace. Again &s;he would con&s;ider of all,
that might have happened in the long pe|riod,
&s;ince her fir&s;t &s;eclu&s;ion at Udolpho,
and her mind was &s;ometimes &s;o over|whelmed
with an apprehen&s;ion, that Va|lancourt
was no more, or that he lived no
longer for her, that the company even of
Blanche became intolerably oppre&s;&s;ive, and
&s;he would &s;it alone in herapartment for hours together, when the engagements of the fami|ly
allowed her to do &s;o, without incivility.</P>
<P><PB N="422" REF="424">
In one of the&s;e &s;olitary hours; &s;he un|locked
a little box, which contained &s;ome letters of Valarncourt, with &s;ome drawings
&s;he had Sketched, during her &s;tay in Tuf|cany,
the latter of which were no longer
intere&s;ting to her; but, in the letters, &s;he
now, with melancholy indulgence, meant
to retrace the tenderne&s;s, that had &s;o often
&s;oothed her, and rendered her, for a mo|ment,
in&s;en&s;ible of the di&s;tance, which fe|parated
her from the writer. But their
effect was now changed; the affection they
expre&s;&s;ed appealed, &s;o forcibly to her heart,
when &s;he con&s;idered that it had, perhaps,
yielded to the powers of time and ab&s;ence,
and even the view of the hand-writing re|called
&s;o many painful recollections, that
&s;he found her&s;elf unable to go through
the fir&s;t &s;he had opened, and &s;at mu&s;ing,
with her cheek re&s;ting on her arm, and
tears &s;tealing from her eyes, when old
Doroth&eacute;e entered the room to inform her, that dinner would be ready, an hour be|fore
the u&s;ual time. Emily &s;tarted on per|ceiving
<PB N="423" REF="425">
her, and ha&s;tily put up the pa|pers,
but not before Doroth&eacute;e, had ob|&s;erved
both her agitation and her tears.</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, ma'am&s;elle!&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &startq;you,
who are &s;o young,&mdash;have you rea&s;on for
&s;orrow?&endq;</P>
<P>Emily tried to &s;mile, but was unable to
&s;peak.</P>
<P>&startq;Alas! dear young lady, when you
come to my age, you will not weep at
tri&s;les; and &s;urely you have nothing &s;eri|ous,
to grieve you.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, Doroth&eacute;e, nothing of any con&s;e|quence,&endq;
replied Emily. Doroth&eacute;e, now
&s;tooping to pick up &s;omething, that had
dropped from among the papers, &s;udden|ly
exclaimed, &startq;Holy Mary! what is it
I &s;ee?&endq; and then, trembling, &s;at down in
a chair, that &s;tood by the table.</P>
<P>&startq;What is it you do &s;ee?&endq; &s;aid Emily,
alarmed by her manner, and looking round
the room.</P>
<P>&startq;It is her&s;elf,&endq; &s;aid Doroth&eacute;e, &startq;her very
<PB N="424" REF="426">
&s;elf! ju&s;t as &s;he looked a little before &s;he died!&endq;</P>
<P>Emily, &s;till more alarmed, began how
to &s;ear, that Doroth&eacute;e was &s;eized with &s;ud|den
phren&s;y, but entreated her to explain her&s;elf.</P>
<P>&startq;That picture!' &s;aid &s;he, &endq;where
did you find it, lady? it is my ble&s;&s;ed
mi&s;tre&s;s; her&s;elf!&endq;</P>
<P>She laid, on the table the miniature,
which Emily had long ago found among
the papers her father had enjoined her to
de&s;troy, and over which &s;he had once
&s;een him &s;hed &s;uch tender and affecting
tears; and, recollecting all the various
circum&s;tances of his conduct, that had
long perplexed her, her emotions in|crea&s;ed
to an exce&s;s, which deprived her
of all power to a&s;k the questions &s;he trem|bled
to have an&s;wered, and &s;he could
only enquire, whether Doroth&eacute;e was cer|tain
the picture re&s;embled the late Mar|chione&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="425" REF="427">
&startq;O, ma'am&s;elle! &s;aid &s;he, how came
it to &s;trike me &s;o, the in&s;tant I &s;aw it, if it
was not my lady's likene&s;s? Ah!&endq; added
&s;he, taking up the miniature, &startq;the&s;e are
her own blue eyes&mdash;looking &s;o &s;weet and &s;o mild; and there is her very? look, &s;uch
as I have often &s;een it, when &s;he had &s;at
thinking for a long while, and then, the
tears would often &s;teal down her cheeks&mdash;
but &s;he never would complain! It was
that look &s;o meek, as it were, and re&s;ign|ed,
that u&s;ed to break my heart and make
me love her &s;o!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Doroth&eacute;e!&endq; &s;aid Emily &s;olemnly, I
am intere&s;ted in the cau&s;e of that grief,
more &s;o, perhaps, than you may imagine;
and I entreat, that you will no longer re|fu&s;e
to indulge my curio&s;ity;&mdash;it is not a
common one.&endq;</P>
<P>As Emily &s;aid this, &s;he remembered the
papers, with which the picture had been
found, and had &s;carcely a doubt, that
they had concerned the Marchione&s;s de
Villeroi; but with this &s;uppo&s;ition came a
<PB N="426" REF="428">
scruple, whether &s;he ought to enquire
further on a &s;ubject, which might prove
to be the &s;ame, that her father had &s;o
carefully endeavoured to conceal. Her
curio&s;ity, concerning the Marchione&s;s,
powerful as it was, it is probable &s;he would
now have re&s;i&s;ted, as &s;he had formerly
done, on unwarily ob&s;erving the few ter|rible
words in the papers, which had never &s;ince been era&s;ed from her memory, had
&s;he been certain that the hi&s;tory of that
lady was the &s;ubject of tho&s;e papers, or,
that &s;uch &s;imple particulars only as it was
probable Doroth&eacute;e could relate were in|cluded
in her father's command. What
was known to her could be no &s;ecret to
many other per&s;ons; and, &s;ince-it appear|ed
very unlikely, that St. Aubert &s;hould
attempt to conceal what Emily might
learn by ordinary means, &s;he at length
Concluded, that, if the papers had related to
the &s;tory of the Marchione&s;s, it was not
tho&s;e circum&s;tances of it, which Doroth&eacute;e
could di&s;clo&s;e, that he had thought &s;uf|ficiently
<PB N="427" REF="429">
&s;iciently important to wi&s;h to have con|cealed.
She, therefore, no longer he&s;itated
to make the enquiries, that might lead to
the gratification of her curio&s;ty.</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, ma'am&s;elle!&endq; &s;aid Doroth&eacute;e, &endq; it
is a &s;ad &s;tory, and cannot be told now:
but what am I &s;aying? I never will tell it.
Many years have pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ince it happen|ed
and I never loved to talk of the Mar|chioine&s;s
to any body, but my hu&s;band.
He lived in the family, at that time, as
well as my&s;elf, and he knew many particu|lars
from me, which nobody el&s;e did; for
I was about the per&s;on of my lady in her
la&s;t illne&s;s, and &s;aw and heard as much,
or more than my lord him&s;elf. Sweet
&s;aint! how patient &s;he was! When &s;he
died, I thought I could have died with
her!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Doroth&eacute;e,&endq; &s;aid Emily. interrupting
her, what you &s;hall tell, you may de|pend
upon it, &s;hall never be di&s;clo&s;ed by
me. 1 have, I repeat it, particular rea|&s;ons
for-wi&s;hing to be informed on this

in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, never to men|tion
what you &s;hall with me to conceal&endq;</P>
<P>Doroth&eacute;e &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed at the ear|ne&s;tne&s;s
of Emily's manner, and, after
regarding her for &s;ome moments, in &s;ilence,
&s;aid, &startq;Young lady! that look of yours
pleads for you&mdash;it is &s;o like my dear mi&s;|tre&s;s's,
that I can almo&s;t fancy I &s;ee her
before me; if you were her daughter, you
could not remind me of her more. But
dinner will be ready&mdash;had you not better
go down?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You will fir&s;t promi&s;e to grant my
reque&s;t,&endq; &s;aid Emily</P>
<P>&startq;And ought not you fir&s;t to tell me,
ma'am&s;elle, how this picture fell into your
hands, and the rea&s;ons you &s;ay you have
for curio&s;ity about my lady?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, no, Doroth&eacute;e, replied Emily,
recollecting her&s;elf, &startq;I have al&s;o particu|lar
rea&s;ons for ob&s;erving &s;ilence, on the&s;e
&s;ubjects, at lea&s;t, till I know further; and,
remember, I do not promi&s;e ever to &s;peak
<PB N="429" REF="431">
upon them; therefore, do not let me in|duce
you to &s;atisfy my curio&s;ity, from an
expectation, that I &s;hall gratify yours;
What I may judge proper to conceal, does
not concern my&s;elf alone, or I &s;hould have
le&s;s &s;cruple in revealing it: let a confi|dence
in my honour alone per&s;uade you to
di&s;clo&s;e what I reque&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, lady!&endq; replied Doroth&eacute;e, after
a long pau&s;e, during which her eyes were
fixed upon Emily, &startq;you &s;eem &s;o much
intere&s;ted,&mdash;and this picture and that face
of yours make me think you have &s;ome
rea&s;on to be &s;o,&mdash;that I will tru&s;t you&mdash;
and tell &s;ome things, that I never told before
to any body, but my hu&s;band, though there
are people, who have &s;u&s;pected as much.
I will tell you the particulars of my lady's
death, too, and &s;ome of my own &s;ulp&s;|cions;
but you mu&s;t fir&s;t promi&s;e me by
all the &s;aints&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>Emily, interrupting her, &s;olemnly pro|mi&s;ed
never to reveal what &s;hould be con|fided
to her, without Doroth&eacute;e's con&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="430" REF="432">
&startq;But there is the horn, ma'am&s;elle,
&s;ounding for dinner,&endq; &s;aid Doroth&eacute;e; &startq;I
mu&s;t be gone.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;When &s;hall I &s;ee you again?&endq; enquired
Emily.</P>
<P>Doroth&eacute;e muled, and then replied,
&startq;Why, madam, it may make people
curious, if it is known I am &s;o much in
your apartment, and- that I hould be forry for; &s;o I will come when I am lea&s;t likely
to be ob&s;erved. I have little lei&s;ure in the
day, and I &s;hall have a good deal to &s;ay
Co, if you plea&s;e, ma'am, I will come, when
the family are all in bed.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That will &s;uit me very well,&endq; replied
Emily: &startq;Remember, then, to-night&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Aye, that is well remembered,&endq; &s;aid
Doroth&eacute;e, &startq;I fear 1 cannot come to|night,
madam, for there will be the
dance of the vintage, and it will be late,
before the &s;ervants go to re&s;t; for, when
they once &s;et. in to dance, they will keep it
up, in the cool of the air, till morning;
at lea&s;t, it u&s;ed to be&s;o in my time.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="431" REF="433">
&startq;Ah! is it the dance of the vintage?&endq;
&s;aid Emily, with a deep &s;igh, remember|ing,
that it was on the evening of this
fe&s;tival, in the preceding year, that St.
Aubert and her&s;elf had arrived in the
neighbourhood of Chateau-le-Blanc. She
pau&s;ed a moment, overcome by the &s;ud|den
recollection, and then, recovering her|&s;elf,
added&mdash;&startq;But this dance is in the
open woods; you, therefore, will not be
wanted, and can ea&s;ily come to me.&endq;</P>
<P>Doroth&eacute;e replied, that &s;he had been ac|cu&s;tomed
to be pre&s;ent at the dance of the
vintage, and &s;he did not wi&s;h to be ab&s;ent
now; &startq;but if I can get away, madam, I
will,&endq; &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>Emily then ha&s;tened to the dining-room,
where the Count conducted him&s;elf with
the courte&s;y, which is in&s;eparable from
true dignity, and of which the Counte&s;s
frequently practi&s;ed little, though her-man|ner
to Emily was an exception to her u&s;ual
habit. But, if &s;he retained few of the or|namental
virtues, The cheri&s;hed other qua|lities,
<PB N="432" REF="434">
which &s;he &s;eemed to con&s;ider invalu|able.
She had di&s;mi&s; &s;ed the graceof mo|de&s;ty,
but then &s;he knew perfectly well
how to manage the &s;tare of a&s; &s;urance; her
manners had little of the tempered &s;weet|ne&s;s,
which is nece&s;&s;ary to render the fe|male
character intere&s;ting, but &s;he could
occa&s;ionally throw into them an affectation
of &s;pirits, which &s;eemed to triumph over
every per&s;on, who approached her. In the
country, however, &s;he generally affected
an elegant languor, that per&s;uaded her al|mo&s;t
to faint, when her favourite read to
her a &s;tory of fictitious &s;orrow; but her coun|tenance
&s;uffered no change, when living ob|jects
of di&s;tre&s;s &s;olicited her charity, and
her heart beat with no tran&s;port to the
thought of giving them in&s;tant relief;&mdash;&s;he
was a &s;tranger to the highe&s;t luxury, of
which, perhaps, the human mind can be
&s;en&s;ible, for her benevolence had never yet
called &s;miles upon the face of mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>In the evening, the Count, with all his
Family, except the Counte&s;s and Mademoi|&s;elle
<PB N="433" REF="435">
Bearn, went to the woods to witne&s;s the
fe&s;tivity of the pea&s;ants. The &s;cene was
in a glade, where the trees, opening, form|ed
a circle round the turf they highly over|&s;hadowed;
between their branches, vines,
loaded with ripe clu&s;ters, were hung in
gay fe&s;toons; and, beneath, were tables,
with fruit, wine, chee&s;e and other rural
fare,&mdash;and &s;eats for the Count and his fa|mily.
At a little di&s;tance, were benches
for the elder pea&s;ants, few of whom, how|ever,
could forbear to join the jocund dance,
which began &s;oon after &s;un-&s;et, when &s;eve|ral
of &s;ixty tripped it with almo&s;t as much
glee and airy lightne&s;s, as tho&s;e of &s;ixteen.</P>
<P>The mu&s;icians, who &s;at carele&s;ly on the
gra&s;s, at the foot of a tree, &s;eemed in|&s;pired
by the found of their own in&s;tru|ments,
which were chiefly flutes and a
kind of long guitar. Behind &s;tood a
boy, flouri&s;hing a tamborine, and dancing
a &s;olo, except that, as he &s;ometimes gaily
to&s;&s;ed the in&s;trument, he tripped among
the other dancers, when his antic ge&s;tures
<PB N="434" REF="436">
called forth a broader laugh, and heighten|ed
the ru&s;tic &s;pirit of the &s;cene.
The Count was highly delighted with
the happine&s;s he witne&s;&s;ed, to which his
bounty had largely contributed, and the
Lady Blanche joined the dance with a
young gentleman of her father's party.
Du Pont reque&s;ted Emily's hand, but her
&s;pirits were too much depre&s;&s;ed, to permit
her to engage in the pre&s;ent fe&s;tivity, which
called to her remembrance that of the pre|ceding
year, when St. Aubert was living,
and of the melancholy &s;cenes, which, had
immediately followed it.</P>
<P>Overcome by the&s;e recollections, &s;he, at
length, left the &s;pot, and walked &s;lowly
into the woods, where the &s;oftened mu&s;ic,
floating at a di&s;tance, &s;oothed her melan|choly
mind. The moon threw a mellow
light among the foliage; the air was balmy
and cool, and Emily, lo&s;t in thought,
&s;trolled on, without ob&s;erving whither, till
&s;he perceived the &s;ounds &s;inking afar off,
and an awful &s;tillne&s;s round her, except
<PB N="435" REF="437">
that, &s;ometimes, the nightingale beguiled
the &s;ilence with
<Q>&startq;Liquid notes,'that clo&s;e the eye of day.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>At length, &s;he found her&s;elf near the
avenue, which, on the night of her father's
arrival, Michael had attempted to pa&s;s in
&s;trarch of a hou&s;e, which was &s;till nearly as
wild and de&s;olate as it had then appeared;
for the Count had been &s;o much engaged
in directing other improvements, that he
had neglected to give orders, concerning
this exten&s;ive approach, and the road was
yet broken, and the trees overloaded with
their own luxuriance.</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;tood &s;urveying it, and remem|bering
the emotions, which &s;he had for|merly
&s;uffered there, &s;he &s;uddenly recol|lected
the figure, that had been &s;een &s;teal|ing
among the trees, and which had re|turned
no an&s;wer to Michael's repeated
calls; and &s;he experienced &s;omewhat of
the fear, that had then a&s;&s;ailed her, for it
did not appear improbable, that the&s;e deep
<PB N="436" REF="438">
woods were occa&s;ionally the haunt of ban|ditti.
She, therefore, turned back, and
was ha&s;tily pur&s;uing her way to the dancers,
when &s;he heard &s;teps approaching from the
avenue; and, being &s;till beyond the call
of the pea&s;ants on the green, for &s;he could
neither hear their voices, or their mu&s;ic,
&s;he quickened her pace; but the per&s;ons
following gained fa&s;t upon her, and, at
length, di&s;tingui&s;hing the voice of Henri,
&s;he walked lei&s;urely, till he came up. He
expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e at meeting her &s;o
far from the company; and, on her &s;ay|ing,
that the plea&s;ant moon-light had be|guiled
her to walk farther than &s;lie in|tended,
an exclamation bur&s;t from the
lips of his companion, and &s;lie thought &s;he
heard Valancourt &s;peak! It was, indeed,
he! and the meeting was &s;uch as may be
imagined, between per&s;ons &s;o affectionate,
and &s;o long Separated as they had been.</P>
<P>In the joy of the&s;e moments, Emily
forgot all her pa&s;t &s;ufferings, and Valan|court
&s;eemed to have forgotten, that any
<PB N="437" REF="439">
per&s;on but Emily exi&s;ted; while $word$
was a &s;ilent and a&s;toni&s;hed &s;pectator of the
&s;cene.</P>
<P>Valancourt a&s;ked a thou&s;and que&s;tions,
concerning her&s;elf and Montoni, which
there was now no time to an&s;wer; but &s;he
learned, that her letter had been forwarded
to him, at Paris, which he had previously
quitted, and was returning to Ga&s;cony, whither the letter al&s;o returned, which, at
length, informed him of Emily's arrival,
and on the receipt of which he had im|mediately
&s;et out for Languedoc. On reaching the mona&s;tery, whence &s;he had dated her letter, he found, to his extreme
di&s;appointment, that the gates were already
clo&s;ed for the night; and believing, that
he &s;hould not &s;ee Emily, till the morrow,
he was returning to his little inn, with the
intention of writing to her, when he was
overtaken by Henri, with whom he had
been intimate at Paris, and was led to her,
whom he was &s;ecretly lamenting that he
&s;hould not &s;ee, till the following day.</P>
<P><PB N="438" REF="440">
Emily, with Valancourt and Henri, now
returned to the green, where the latter pre|tented
Valancourt to the Count, who, &s;he
fancied, received him with le&s;s than his
u&s;ual benignity, though it appeared, that
they were nor &s;trangers to each other.
He was invited, however, to partake of the
diver&s;ions of the evening; and, when he
had paid his re&s;pects to the Count, and
while the dancers continued their fe&s;tivity,
he &s;eated him&s;elf by Emily, and conver&s;ed,
without con&s;traint. The lights, which were
hung among the trees, under which they
&s;at, allowed her a more perfect view of
the countenance &s;he had &s;o frequently in
ab&s;ence endeavoured to recollect and &s;he
perceived, with &s;ome regret, that it was
not &s;he &s;ame as when la&s;t &s;he &s;aw it.
There was all its wonted intelligence and
fire; but it had lost much of the &s;impli|city,
and &s;omewhat of the open benevo|lence,
that u&s;ed to characteri&s;e it. Still,
however, it was an intere&s;ting counte|nance;
but Emily thought &s;he perceived,
<PB N="439" REF="441">
at intervals, anxiety contract, and me|lancholy
&s;ix the features of Valancourt;
&s;ometimes, too, he fell into a momen|tary
mu&s;ing, and then appeared anxious
to di&s;&s;ipate thought; while, at others,
as he fixed his eyes on Emily, a kind of
&s;udden di&s;traction &s;eemed to cro&s;s his
mind. In her he perceived the &s;ame good|ne&s;s
and beautiful&s; implicity, that had
charmed him, on their fir&s;t acquaintance.
The bloom of her countenance was &s;ome|what
faded, but all its &s;weetne&s;s remained,
and it was rendered more interesting, than
ever, by the faint expre&s;&s;ion of melancholy,
that &s;ometimes mingled with her &s;mile.</P>
<P>At his reque&s;t, &s;he related the mo&s;t im|portant
circum&s;tances, that had occurred
to her, &s;ince &s;he left France, and emotions
of pity and indignation alternately pre|vailed
in his mind, when he heard how
much &s;he had &s;uffered from the villany of
Montoni. More than once, when &s;he was
&s;peaking of his conduct, of which the
guilt was rather &s;&s;tened, than exaggerated,
<PB N="440" REF="442">
by her repre&s;entation, he &s;tarted from his
&s;eat; and walked away, apparently over|come
as much by &s;elf accu&s;ation as by re|&s;entment.
Her &s;ufferings alone were men|tioned
in the few words, which he could
addre&s;s to her, and he li&s;tened not to the
account, which &s;he was careful to give as
di&s;tinctly as po&s;&s;ible, of the pre&s;ent lo&s;s of
Madame Montoni's e&s;tates, and of the lit|tle
rea&s;on there was to expect their re&s;to|ration.
At length, Valancourt remained
lo&s;t in thought, and then &s;ome &s;ecret cau&s;e
&s;eemed to overcome him with angui&s;h.
Again he abruptly left her. When he
returned, &s;he perceived, that he had been
weeping, and tenderly begged, that he
would compo&s;e him&s;elf. &startq;My &s;ufferings
are all pa&s;&s;ed now,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &startq;for I have
e&s;caped from the tyranny of Montoni, and
I &s;ee you well&mdash;let me al&s;o &s;ee you happy.&endq;</P>
<P>Valancourt was more agitated, than be|fore.
&startq;I am unworthy of you, Emily,&endq;
&s;aid he, &startq;I am unworthy of you;&endq;&mdash;
words, by his manner of uttering which
<PB N="441" REF="443">
Emily was then more &s;hocked than by their
import. She fixed on him a mournful and
enquiring eye. &startq;Do not look thus on
me,&endq; &s;aid he, turning away and pre&s;&s;ing
her hand; &startq;I cannot bear tho&s;e looks.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I would a&s;k,&endq; &s;aid Emily, in a gentle,
but agitated voice, &startq;the meaning of your
words; but I perceive, that the que&s;tion
would di&s;tre&s;s you now. Let us talk on
other &s;ubjects. To-morrow, perhaps, you
may be more compo&s;ed. Ob&s;erve tho&s;e
moon light woods, and the towers, which
appear ob&s;curely in the per&s;pective. You
u&s;ed to be a great admirer of land&s;cape,
and I have heard you &s;ay, that the faculty
of deriving con&s;olation, under misfortune,
from the &s;ublime pro&s;pects, which neither
oppre&s;&s;ion, or poverty with-hold from us,
was the peculiar ble&s;&s;ing of the innocent.&endq;
Valancourt was deeply affected.
&startq;Yes,&endq; replied he, &startq;I had once a ta&s;te for inno|cent
and elegant delights&mdash;I had once an
uncorrupted heart.&endq; Then, checking him|self,
<PB N="442" REF="444">
he added, &startq;Do you remember our
journey together in the Pyren&eacute;es?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Can I forget it?&endq; &s;aid Emily.&mdash;
&startq;Would that I could!&endq; he replied;&mdash;
&startq;that was the happie&s;t period of my life.
I then loved, with enthu&s;ia&s;m, whatever
was truly great, or good.&endq; It was &s;ome
time before Emily could repre&s;s her tears,
and try to command her emotions. &startq;If you
wi&s;h to forget that journey,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &startq;it
mu&s;t certainly be my wi&s;h to forget it
al&s;o.&endq; She pau&s;ed, and then added, &endq; You
make me very unea&s;y; but this is not the
time for further enquiry;&mdash;yet, how can I
&startq;bear to believe, even for a moment, that
you are le&s;s worthy of my e&s;teem than
formerly? I have &s;till &s;ufficient confidence
in your candour, to believe, that, when I
&s;hall a&s;k for an explanation, you will give
it me.&startq;&mdash;&startq;Yes,&endq; &s;aid Valancourt, &startq;yes,
Emily: I have not yet lo&s;t my candour:
if I had, I could better have di&s;gui&s;ed my
emotions, on learning what were your &s;uf|ferings
<PB N="443" REF="445">
&mdash;your virtues,&mdash;while I&mdash;I&mdash;but $
will &s;ay no more. I did not mean to have
&s;aid even &s;o much&mdash;I have been &s;urpri&s;ed
into the &s;elf-accu&s;ation. Tell me, Emily,
that you will not forget that journey&mdash;will
not wi&s;h to forget it, and I will be calm.
1 would not lo&s;e the remembrance of it
for the whole earth,&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How contradictory is this!&endq; &s;aid
Emily;&mdash;&startq;but we may be over-heard.
My recollection, of it &s;hall depend upon
yours; I will endeavour to forget, or to
recoilect it, as you may do. Let us join
the Count.&mdash;&startq;Tell me, fir&s;t, &s;aid Valan|oourt.&endq;
that you forgive the unea&s;ine&s;s I
have occa&s;ioned you, this evening, and that
you will &s;till love me.&mdash;&startq;I &s;incerely for|give
you, replied Emily.&endq; You be&s;t
know whether I &s;hall continue to love you,
for you know whether you de&s;erve my
e&s;teem. At pre&s;ent, I will believe that
you do. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay,&endq; added
&s;he, ob&s;erving his dejection, &startq;how much
pain it would give me to believe other|wife.
<PB N="444" REF="446">
&mdash;The young lady, who approaches,
is the Count's daughter.&endq;</P>
<P>Valancourt and Emily now joined the
Lady Blanche; and the party, &s;oon after,
&s;at down with the Count, his &s;on, and the
Chevalier Du Pont, at a banquet, &s;pread
under a gay awoing, beneath the trees.
At the table al&s;o were &s;eated &s;everal of the
mo&s;t venerable of the Count's tenants, and
it was a fe&s;tive repa&s;t to all but Valancourt
and Emily. When the Count retired to
the chateau, he did not invite Valan court
to accompany him, who, therefore, took
leave of Emily, and retired to his &s;olitary
inn for the night: meanwhile, &s;he &s;oon
withdrew to her own apartment, where &s;he
mu&s;ed, with deep anxiety and concern, on
his behaviour, and on the Count's recep|tion
of him. Her attention was thus &s;o
wholly engaged, that ihe forgot Doroth&s;e
and her appointment,: till morning was
far advanced, when, knowing that the
good old Woman would not come, &s;he re|tired,
for a few hours, to repo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="445" REF="447">
On the following day, when the Count
had accidentally joined Emily in one of
the walks, they talked of the fe&s;tival of
the preceding evening, and this led him
to a mention of Valancourt. &startq;That is a
young man of talents,&endq; &s;aid he; &startq;you
were formerly acquainted with him, I per|ceive.&endq;
Emily &s;aid, that &s;he was. &startq;He
was introduced to me, at Paris,&endq; &s;aid the
Count, &startq;and I was much plea&s;ed with
him, on our fir&s;t acquaintance.&endq; He pau&s;|ed,
and Emily trembled, between the de|&s;ire
of hearing more and the fear of &s;hew|ing
the Count, that &s;he felt an intere&s;t on
the &s;ubject. &startq;May I ask,&endq; &s;aid he, at
length, &startq;how long you have known Mon|&s;ieur
Valancourt?&mdash;&startq;Will you allow me
to a&s;k your rea&s;on for the que&s;tion, &s;ir?&endq; &s;aid &s;he; &startq;and I will an&s;wer it immedi|ately,&mdash;Certainly,&endq;
&s;aid the Count,
&startq;that is but ju&s;t. I will tell you my rea|&s;on.
I cannot but perceive, that Mon&s;ieur
Valancourt admires you; in that, how|ever,
there is nothing extraordinary; every
<PB N="446" REF="448">
per&s;on, who &s;ees you, mu&s;t do the &s;ame,
I am above u&s;ing common-place compli|ments;
I; &s;peak with &s;incerity. What I
fear, is, that he is a favoured admirer.&endq;&mdash;
&mdash;&startq;Why do you fear it, &s;ir?&endq; &s;aid Emily,
endeavouring to conceal her emotion.&mdash;
&startq;Becau&s;e,&endq; replied the Count, &startq;I think
him not worthy of your favour.&endq; Emily,
greatly agitated, entreated further explana|tion.
&startq;I will give it,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;if you
will believe; that nothing but a &s;trong in|tere&s;t
in your welfare could induce me to
hazard that affertion.&endq;&mdash;&startq;I mu&s;t believe
&s;o, &s;ir,&endq; replied Emily.</P>
<P>&startq;But let us re&s;t under the&s;e trees,&endq; &s;aid
the Count, ob&s;erving the palene&s;s of her
countenance; &startq;here is a &s;eat&mdash;you are
fatigued.&endq; They &s;at down, and the Count
proceeded. &startq;Many young ladies, cir|cum&s;tanced
as you are, would think my
conduct, on this occa&s;ion;' and on &s;o &s;hort
an acquaintance, impertinent, in&s;tead of
friendly; from what I have ob&s;erved of
your temper and under&s;tanding, I do not
<PB N="447" REF="449">
fear &s;uch a return from you. Our ac|quaintance
has been &s;hort, but long
enough to make me e&s;teem you, and feel a
lively intere&s;t in your happine&s;s. You de|&s;erve
to be very happy, and I tru&s;t that
you will be &s;o.&endq; Emily &s;ighed &s;oftly, and
bowed her thanks. The Count pau&s;ed
again. &startq;I am unpleasantly circum&s;tanced,&endq;
&s;aid he; &startq;but an opportunity of rendering
you important &s;ervice &s;hall overcome infe|rior
con&s;lderations. Will you inform me
of the manner of your fir&s;t acquaintance
with the Chevalier Valancourt, if the &s;ub|ject
is not too painful?&endq;</P>
<P>Emily briefly related the accident of
their meeting in the pre&s;ence of her father,
and then &s;o earne&s;tly entreated the Count
not to he&s;itate in declaring what he knew,
that he perceived the violent emotion,
again&s;t which &s;he was contending, and,
regarding her with a look of tender com|pa&s;&s;ion,
con&s;idered how he might commu|nicate
his information with lea&s;t pain to his
anxious auditor.</P>
<P><PB N="448" REF="450">
&startq;The Chevalier and my &s;on&endq; &s;aid he,
&startq;were introduced to each other, at the
table of a brother officer, at who&s;e hou&s;e I
al&s;o met him, and invited him to my own,
whenever he &s;hould be di&s;engaged. I did not
then know, that he had formed an acquaint|ance
with a &s;et of men, a di&s;grace to their
&s;pecies, who live by plunder and pa&s;s their
lives in continual debauchery. I knew &s;everal
of the Chevalier's family, re&s;ident at Paris,
and con&s;idered them as &s;ufficient pledges
for his introduction to my own. But you
are ill; I will leave the &s;ubject.&endq;&mdash;&startq;No,
&s;ir,&startq;&s;aid Emily, &startq;I beg you will proceed:
I am only di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.&endq;&mdash;&startq; Only!&endq; &s;aid the
Count, with empha&s;is; &startq;however, I will
proceed. I &s;oon learned, that the&s;e, his
a&s;&s;ociates, had drawn him into a cour&s;e of
di&s;&s;ipation, from which he appeared to
have neither the power, nor the inclina|tion,
to extricate him&s;elf. He lo&s;t large
&s;ums at the gaming table; he became in|&s;atuated
with play; and was ruined. I
&s;poke tenderly of this to his friends, who
<PB N="449" REF="451">
a&s;&s;ured me, that they had remon&s;trated
with him, till they were weary. I after|wards
learned, that, in con&s;ideration of his
talents for play, which were generally &s;uc|ce&s;sful,
when unoppo&s;ed by the tricks of
villany,&mdash;that in con&s;ideracion of the&s;e, the
party had initiated him into the &s;ecrets of
their trade, and allotted him a &s;hare of their
profits.&startq;&endq; Impo&s;&s;ible!&endq; &s;aid Emily &s;ud|denly;
&startq;but&mdash;pardon me, &s;ir, I &s;carcely
know what I &s;ay; allow for the di&s;tre&s;s of
my mind. I mu&s;t, indeed, I mu&s;t be|lieve,
that you have not been truly in|formed.
The Chevalier had, doubtle&s;s,
enemies, who mi&s;repre&s;ented him.&endq;&mdash;&startq; I
&s;hould be mo&s;t happy to believe &s;o,&endq; replied
the Count, &startq;but I cannot. Nothing &s;hort
of conviction, and a regard for your hap|pine&s;s,
could have urged me to repeat the&s;e
unplea&s;ant reports.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily was &s;ilent. She recollected Va|lancourt's
&s;ayings, on the preceding even|ing,
which di&s;covered the pangs of &s;elf|reproach,
and &s;eemed to confirm all that
<PB N="450" REF="452">
the Count bad related. Yet &s;he had not
fortitude enough to dare conviction. Her
heart was overwhelmed with angui&s;h at the
mere &s;u&s;picion of his guilt, and &s;he could
not endure a belief of it. After a long
&s;ilence, the Count &s;aid, &startq;I perceive, and
can allow for, your want of conviction.
It is nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould give &s;ome proof of
what I have a&s;&s;erted; but this I cannot
do, without &s;ubjecting one, who is very
dear to me, to danger.&endq;&mdash;&startq; What is the
danger you apprehend, &s;ir?&endq; &s;aid Emily;
&startq;if I can prevent it, you may &s;afely. con|&s;ide
in my honour.&endq;&mdash;&startq; On your honour
I am certain I can rely,&endq; &s;aid the Count;
&startq;but can 1 tru&s;t your fortitude? Do you
think you can re&s;i&s;t the &s;olicitation of a
favoured admirer, when he pleads, in affliction,
for the name of one who has
robbed him of a bie&s;&s;ing?&endq;&mdash;&startq;&s;hall not
be expo&s;ed to &s;uch a temptation &s;ir,&startq;&s;aid
Emily, with mode&s;t pride,&endq; for I cannot
favour one, whom I mu&s;t no longer 'e&s;teem.
I, hovrever, readily give my word.&endq; Tears,
<PB N="451" REF="453">
in the mean time, contradicted her fir&s;t
a&s;&s;ertion; and &s;he felt, that time and effort
only could eradicate an affection, which
had been formed on virtuous e&s;teem, and
cheri&s;hed by habit and difficulty.</P>
<P>&startq;I will tru&s;t you then,&endq; &s;aid the Count,
&startq;for conviction is nece&s;&s;ary to your peace,
and cannot, I perceive, be obtained, with|out
this confidence. My &s;on has too often
been an eye-witne&s;s of the Chevalier's ill|conduct;
he was very near being drawn
in by it; he was, indeed, drawn in to the
commi&s;&s;ion of many follies, but I re&s;cued
him from guilt and de&s;truction. Judge
then, Mademoi&s;elle St. Aubert, whether a
father, who had nearly lo&s;t his only &s;on by
the example of the Chevalier, has not,
from conviction, rea&s;on to warn tho&s;e,
whom he e&s;teems, again&s;t tru&s;ting their
happine&s;s in &s;uch hands. I have my&s;elf
&s;een the Chevalier engaged in deep play
with men, whom I almo&s;t &s;huddered to
look upon. If you &s;till doubt, I will refer
you to my &s;on.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="452" REF="454">
&startq;I mu&s;t not doubt what you have your|&s;elf
witne&s;&s;ed,&endq; replied Emily, &s;inking
with grief, &startq;or what you a&s;&s;ert. But the
Chevalier has, perhaps, been drawn only
into a tran&s;ient folly, which he may never
repeat. If you had known the ju&s;tne&s;&s; of
his former principles, you would allow for
my pre&s;ent incredulity.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Alas!&endq; ob&s;erved the Count, &startq;it is
difficult to believe that, which will make us
wretched. But I will not &s;ooth you by
flattering and fal&s;e hopes. We all Know
how fa&s;cinating the vice of gaming is, and
how difficult it i&s; is, also, to conquer habit;
the Chevalier might, perhaps, reform for
a while, but he would &s;oon relap&s;e into
di&s;&s;ipation&mdash;for I fear, not only the bonds
of habit would be powerful, but that his
morals are corrupted. And&mdash;why &s;hould
I conceal from you, that play is not his
only vice? he appears to have a ta&s;te for
every vicious plea&s;ure.&endq;</P>
<P>The Count he&s;itated and pau&s;ed; while
Emily endeavoured to &s;upport her&s;elf, as,
<PB N="453" REF="455">
with increa&s;ing perturbation, &s;he expected
what he might further &s;ay. A long pau&s;e
of &s;ilence en&s;ued, during which he was
vi&s;ibly agitated; at length, he &s;aid, It
Would be a cruel delicacy, that could pre|vail
with me to be &s;ilent&mdash;and I will in|form
you, that the Chevalier's extrava|gance
has brought him twice into the pri|&s;ons
of Paris, from whence he was la&s;t
extricated, as I was told upon authority,
which I cannot doubt, by a well-known
Pari&s;ian Counte&s;s, with whom he continued
to re&s;ide, when I left Paris.&endq;</P>
<P>He pau&s;ed again; and, looking at
Emily, perceived her countenance change,
and that &s;he was falling from &s;he &s;eat;
he caught her, but &s;he had fainted,
and he called loudly for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. They
were, however, beyond the hearing of his
&s;ervants at the chateau, and he feared to
leave her while he went thither for a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance,
yet knew not how otherwise to ob|tain
it; till a fountain at no great di&s;tance
caught his eye, and he endeavoured to
<PB N="454" REF="456">
&s;upport Emily again&s;t the tree, under which
&s;he had been &s;itting, while he went thi|ther
for water. But, again he was per|plexed,
for he had nothing near him, in
which water could be brought; but while,
with increa&s;ed anxiety, he watched her,
he thought he perceived in her counte|nance
&s;ymptons of returning life.</P>
<P>It was long, however, before &s;hereviv|ed,
and &s;he then found her&s;elf &s;upported&mdash;
not by the Count, but by Valancourt, who
was observing her with looks of earne&s;t ap|prehen&s;ion,
and who now &s;poke to her in
a tone, tremulous with his anxiety. At the
&s;ound of his well-known voice, the rai&s;ed
her eyes, but pre&s;ently clo&s;ed them, and a
faintne&s;s again came over her.</P>
<P>The Count, with a look &s;omewhat &s;tern,
waved him to withdraw; but he only &s;ighed
heavily, and called on the name of Emily,
as he again held the water, that had been
brought, to her lips. On the Count's re|peating
his action, and accompanying it
with words, Valancourt an&s;wered him with
<PB N="455" REF="457">
a look of deep re&s;entment, and refu&s;ed to
leave the place, till &s;he &s;hould revive, or
to re&s;ign her for a moment to the care of
any per&s;on. In the next in&s;tant, his con|&s;cience
Teemed to inform him of what had been the &s;ubject of the Count's con|ver&s;ation
with Emily, and indignation
fla&s;lied in his eyes; but it was quickly re|pre&s;&s;ed,
and &s;ucceeded by an expre&s;&s;ion of
&s;crious angui&s;h, that induced the Count to
regard him with more pity than re&s;entment,
and the view of which &s;o much affected
Emily, when &s;he again revived, that &s;he
yielded to the weakne&s;s of tears. But &s;he
&s;oon re&s;trained them, and, exerting her re&s;olution
to appear recovered, &s;he ro&s;e, thanked the Count and Henri, with whom
Valancourt had entered the garden, for their
care, and moved towards the chateau, without noticing Valancourt, who, heart|&s;truck
by her manner, exclaimed in a low
voice&mdash;&startq;Good God! how have I de&s;erved
this?&mdash;what has been &s;aid, to occa&s;ion this
change?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="456" REF="458">
Emily, without replying, but with in|crea&s;ed
emotion, quickened her &s;teps.
&startq;What has thus di&s;ordered you, Emily?
&s;aid he, as he &s;till walked by her &s;ide:
give me a few moments' conver&s;ation,
I entreat you;&mdash;I am very mi&s;erable!&endq;</P>
<P>Though this was &s;poken in a low voice,
it was overheard by the Count, who im|mediately
replied, that Mademoi&s;elle St.
Aubert was then too much indi&s;po&s;ed, to
attend to any conver&s;ation, but that he
would venture to promi&s;e &s;he would &s;ee
Mon&s;ieur Valancourt on the morrow, if &s;he was better.</P>
<P>Valancourt's cheek was crim&s;oned: he
looked haughtily at the Count, and then
at Emily, with &s;ucce&s;&s;ive expre&s;&s;ions of
&s;urpri&s;e, grief and &s;upplication, which she
could neither mi&s;under&s;tand, or re&s;i&s;t, and
&s;he &s;aid languidly&mdash;I &s;hall be better
tomorrow, and if you wi&s;h to accept the
Count's permi&s;&s;ion, I will &s;ee you then.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;See me!&endq; exclaimed Valancourt, as
he threw a glance of mingled pride and
<PB N="457" REF="459">
re&s;entment upon the Count; and then,
&s;eeming to recollect him&s;elf, he added&mdash;
&startq;But I will come, madam; I will accept
the Count's permi&s;&s;ion.&endq;</P>
<P>When they reached the door of the cha|teau,
he lingered a moment, for his re|&s;entment
was now fled; and then, with a
look &s;o expre&s;&s;ive of tenderne&s;s and grief,
that Emily's heart was not proof again&s;t
it, he bade her good morning, and, bow|ing
&s;lightly to the Count, di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>Emily withdrew to her own apartment,
under &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ion of heart as &s;he had
&s;eldom known, when &s;he endeavoured to
recollect all that the Count had told, to
examine the probability of the circum|&s;tances
he him&s;elf believed, and to con&s;i|der
of her future conduct towards Valan|court.
But, when &s;he attempted to think,
her mind refu&s;ed controul, and &s;he could
only feel that &s;he was mi&s;erable. One mo|ment,
&s;he &s;unk under the conviction, that
Valancourt was no longer the &s;ame, whom
had &s;o tenderly loved, the idea of
<PB N="458" REF="460">
whom had hitherto &s;upported her under
affliction, and cheered her with the hope
of happier days,&mdash;but a fallen a worth|le&s;s
character, whom &s;he mu&s;t teach her|&s;elf
to de&s;pi&s;e&mdash;if &s;he could not forget. Then, unable to endure this terrible &s;up|po&s;ition,
&s;he rejected it, and di&s;dained to
believe him capable of conduct, &s;uch as
the Count had de&s;cribed, to whom &s;he
believed he had been mi&s;repre&s;eneed by
&s;ome artful enemy; and there were mo|ments,
when &s;he even ventured to doubt
the integrity of the Count him&s;elf, and to
&s;u&s;pect, that he was influenced by &s;ome
&s;elfi&s;h motive, to break her connection with
Valancourt. But this was the error of an
in&s;tant, only; the Count's character, which
&s;he had heard &s;poken of by Du Pont and
many other per&s;ons, and had her&s;elf ob|&s;erved,
enabled her to judge, and forbade
the &s;uppo&s;ition; had her confidence, in|deed,
been le&s;s, there appeared to be no
temptation to betray him into conduct &s;o
treacherous, and &s;o cruel. Nor did reflec|tion
<PB N="459" REF="461">
&s;uffer her to pre&s;erve the hope, that
Va$ancourt had been mi&s;repre&s;ented to the
Count, who had &s;aid, that he &s;poke chief|ly
from his own ob&s;ervation, and from his
&s;on's experience. She mu&s;t part from Va|lancourt,
therefore, for ever&mdash;for what of
either happine&s;s or tranquillity could &s;he
expert with a man, who&s;e ta&s;tes were! de|generated
into low inclinations, and to
whom vice was become habitual? whom
&s;he mu&s;t no longer e&s;teem, though the re|membrance
of what he once was, and the
long habit of loving him, would render
it very difficult for her to de&s;pi&s;e him.</P>
<P>&startq;O Valancourt!&endq; &s;he would exclaim,
&startq;having been &s;eparated &s;o long&mdash;do we
meet, only to be mi&s;erable&mdash;only to part
for ever?&endq;</P>
<P>Amid&s;t all the tumult of her mind, &s;he
remembered pertinaciou&s;ly the &s;eeming
candour and &s;implicity of his conduct, on
the preceding night; and, had &s;he dared
to tru&s;t her own-heart, it would have led
her to hope much from this. Still &s;he
<PB N="460" REF="462">
could not re&s;olve to di&s;mi&s;s him for ever,
without obtaining further proof of his ill
conduct; yet &s;he &s;aw no probability of pro|curing
it, if, indeed, proof more po&s;itive
was po&s;&s;ible. Something, however, it was
nece&s;&s;ary to decide upon, and the almo&s;t
determined to be guided in her opinion
&s;olely by the manner, with which Valan|court
&s;hould receive her hints concerning
his late conduct.</P>
<P>Thus pa&s;&s;ed the hours till dinner-time,
when Emily, Struggling again&s;t the pre&s;|&s;ure
of her grief, dried her tears, and
joined the family at table, where the Count
pre&s;erved towards her the mo&s;t delicate at|tention;
but the Counte&s;s and Mademoi|&s;elle
Bearn, having looked, for a moment,
with &s;urpri&s;e, on her dejected countenance,
began, as u&s;ual, to talk of tri&s;les, while
the eyes of Lady Blanche a&s;ked much of
her friend, who could only reply by a
mournful &s;mile.</P>
<P>Emily withdrew as &s;oon after dinner as
po&s;&s;ible, and was followed by the Lady
<PB N="461" REF="463">
Blanche, who&s;e anxious enquiries, how|ever,
&s;he found her&s;elf quite unequal to
an&s;wer, and whom &s;he entreated to &s;pare
her on the &s;ubject of her di&s;tre&s;s. To
conver&s;e on any topic, was now, indeed,
&s;o extremely painful to her, that &s;he &s;oon
gave up the attempt, and Blanche le&s;t
her, with pity of the &s;orrow, which &s;he
perceived &s;he had no power to a&s;&s;uage.</P>
<P>Emily &s;ecretly determined to go to her
convent in a day or two; for company, e&s;|pecially
that of the Counte&s;s and Made|moi&s;elle
Bearn, was intolerable to her, in
the pre&s;ent &s;tate of her &s;pirits; and, in
the retirement of the convent, as well as the
kindne&s;s of the abbe&s;s, &s;he hoped to reco|ver
the command of her mind, and to
teach it re&s;ignation to the event, which, &s;he
too plainly perceived, was approaching.</P>
<P>To have lo&s;t Valancourt by death, or to
have &s;een him married to a rival, would,
&s;he thought, have given her le&s;s angui&s;h,
than a conviction of his unworthine&s;s,
which mu&s;t terminate in mi&s;ery to him&s;elf,
<PB N="462" REF="464">
and which robbed her even of the &s;olitary
image her heart &s;o long had cheri&s;hed.
The&s;e painful reflections were interrupted,
for a moment, by a note from Valancourt,
written in evident di&s;traction of mind, en|treating,
that &s;he would permit him to &s;ee
her on the approaching evening, in&s;tead of
the following morning; a reque&s;t, which
occa&s;ioned her &s;o much agitation, that &s;he
was unable to an&s;wer it. She wi&s;hed to
&s;ee him, and to terminate her pre&s;ent &s;tate
of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, yet &s;hrunk from the interview,
and, incapable of deciding for her&s;elf, &s;he,
at length, &s;ent to beg a few moments'
conver&s;ation with the Count in his library, where &s;he delivered to him the note, and
reque&s;ted his advice. After reading it, he,
&s;aid, that, if &s;he believed her&s;elf well
enough to &s;upport the interview, his opi|nion
was, that, for the relief of both
parties, it ought to take place, that even|ing.</P>
<P>&startq;His affection for you is, undoubtedly,
A very &s;incere one,&endq; added the Count;
<PB N="463" REF="465">
&startq;and he appears &s;o much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and
you, my amiable friend, are &s;o ill at ca&s;e
&mdash;that the &s;ooner the affair is decided, the
better.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily replied, therefore, to Valancourt,
that &s;he would &s;ee him, and then exerted
her&s;elf in endeavours to attain fortitude
and compo&s;ure, to bear her through the
approaching &s;cene&mdash;a &s;cene &s;o afflictingly
the rever&s;e of any, to which &s;he had look|ed
forward!</P>
