<P>This Vacuum is the half Hour im|mediately preceding Dinner; when Di|amonds &s;cratch Sa&s;h-windows, or deco|rate Drinking-gla&s;&s;es; when Plates are turn'd round upon Forks, and the In&s;ide of <HI>French</HI> Roles moulded into Geome|trical Trapeziums.</P>

<HEAD>TO TRISTRAM SHANDY, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE World waits with Im|patience for your coming in|to it. I can't &s;ay, that if I &s;ee you here, I &s;hall take you by the Hand, and heartily congratulate your Arrival. You'll enter upon a very trouble&s;ome Po&s;t; every one will a&s;k you Que&s;tions.&mdash;Pray, Mr. <HI>Tri|&s;tram,</HI> What do you mean by the black Plate?&mdash;<HI>Shandy,</HI> Who are tho&s;e A&s;teri&s;ks de&s;ign'd for?&mdash;Do, dear Creature, inform we what's become of the Widow <HI>Wadham?</HI>&mdash;With many more as pertinent In|terrogatories.</P>
<P>Such is the cu&s;tomary Tribute Curio&s;ity exacts from every living
<PB N="ii" REF="6">Writer, when Fame has &s;tamp'd the Sterling Mark of Merit upon his Undertakings.</P>
<P>Great is the Di&s;appointment to the Genius, who&s;e Works are not under&s;tood; or, what is wor&s;e, mi&s;|under&s;tood.&mdash;Often it will happen, Per&s;ons &s;hall be plea&s;ed, or di&s;plea|&s;ed, with an Author; not becau&s;e they <HI>do</HI> under&s;tand him, but only becau&s;e they fancy &s;o.&mdash;For Ex|ample,&mdash;I board at pre&s;ent with a di&s;tant Relation of mine, a very good old Woman, a little too much given to Methodi&s;m indeed, as mo&s;t old Women are. La&s;t Night, hear|ing me read Part of <HI>Milton</HI>'s <HI>Pa|radi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> &s;he appear'd delighted with it, often interrupting me, &s;ay|ing,&mdash;Child, the&s;e are lofty Words,&mdash;fine Writing indeed;&mdash;the Man that made the Book was no Fool, I promi&s;e you:&mdash;A good Chri&s;tian I warrant him: But when I repeated that Line in <HI>Santan</HI>'s Speech,&mdash;<HI>Better to reign in Hell, than &s;erve in Heaven.</HI>
<PB N="iii" REF="7">Dear Mr. <HI>Tri&s;tram!</HI> Had you &s;een what a Pa&s;&s;ion my Aunt was in, you wou'd have ble&s;s'd your&s;elf.&mdash;Had Dr. <HI>Slop</HI> &s;een her, he wou'd have cro&s;s'd him&s;elf:&mdash;Had your Uncle &s;een her, he wou'd have fortified him&s;elf. She da&s;h'd her Knitting to the Ground, flung the Book up|on the Fire, and call'd me&mdash;no Scho|lia&s;t, Annotator, Emendator, Ex|planator, Commentator, or Inter|polator; was evermore malicious, abu&s;ive, or exa&s;perating. She &s;eem'd black in the Face, like a half-&s;trang|led Turkey Cock. When &s;he bid me get out of <HI>her</HI> Hou&s;e.&mdash;Oh! Sir, the Fear of not eating has va&s;t Force.&mdash;I gave up the Poet,&mdash;and by way of Atonement, read to her Mr. <HI>Whitfield</HI>'s Journal and Journey.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome People who can write, and &s;ome People who can read; and People upon People who pretend to both, yet can do neither. Now, Sir, as you can both
<PB N="iv" REF="8">write and read,&mdash;ay,&mdash;and as it &s;hou'd be; pray put &s;ome Notes to your next Edition, for Notes &s;et a Book off, as Lace does a Coat; a rare ornamental Edging: They are aga|rical Stiptics, which &s;top an Author from running to Wa&s;te, after an Excre&s;cence is critically amputated. They are the only Sheathings a Genius can u&s;e, to prevent Com|mentator's Maggots from impairing his Works, by eating it away with rotten Interpretations.</P>
<P>I dined la&s;t Week at Sir <HI>Goutly Scutcheon</HI>'s,&mdash;at his own Table; for Authors are not always oblig'd to fill their Bellies in the Steward's Room. The Di&s;cour&s;e was about your Life and Opinions.&mdash;Sir <HI>Gouty,</HI> after he had &s;hut his Pick-tooth-ca&s;e, &s;ipp'd up his Heel-tap, and pu&s;h'd by the Fruit Offals,&mdash;thus ob&s;erv'd; I wonder when we &s;hall have any more of <HI>Shandy</HI> printed? That Fellow's a devili&s;h keen Wri|ter; its clear to me, in his &s;ub|&s;equent
<PB N="v" REF="9">&s;equent Books, he'll be pretty &s;evere upon our mini&s;terial Mi&s;car|riages.</P>
<P><HI>Then thus her Lady&s;hip.</HI> He's an immen&s;e odd Mortal, &s;omehow &s;o exce&s;&s;ively out of the Way.&mdash;That Story of winding up the Clock, is &s;o droll. I wi&s;h, my Dear, you wou'd invite him to take a Dinner with us: Very likely, as he writes you know, he may want one. I mu&s;t know the particular People he points at; for I take it to be &s;ome|thing in the Nature of the <HI>Atalantis.</HI> As to Aunt <HI>Dinah,</HI> and the Coach|man, I'm po&s;itive I know the Par|ties.</P>
<P><HI>Replication of the Baronet.</HI> I can pretty well account for the Hints in the fir&s;t Volume. As to the Se|cond,&mdash;turning it over to look for the Index, I &s;aw &s;omething like a Sermon at the End.&mdash;Now that is the Fault of all the&s;e Memoir Wri|ters, they cannot help being dull
<PB N="vi" REF="10">now and then.&mdash;Indeed I ran over the fir&s;t Paragraph of the Sermon, expecting he might open as droll upon the Par&s;ons, as he had upon the Lawyers:&mdash;But quite contrary,&mdash;it was a long Di&s;cour&s;e about Con&s;cience, and&mdash;I was &s;oon &s;ick of it.</P>
<P>Pray, Sir <HI>Scutcheon,</HI> what does he mean by Hobby-hor&s;es?</P>
<P>Child, that's a Joke upon Gen|tlemen Jockies.</P>
<P>Who is meant by the Midwife, pray?</P>
<P>Oh, Mr. <HI>Pitt,</HI> a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf; and Yorick is put for <HI>Garrick;</HI> and the Fight with the ten Stars, means the Mob that broke his Windows about the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Fe&s;tival: As to the Extract from <HI>Shandy</HI>'s Mother's Set|tlement, it's a Pun upon the Mar|riage Act; and all that Work about
<PB N="vii" REF="11">Chri&s;tian Names, is only a Touch again&s;t Anabapti&s;m.</P>
<P>But the old Uncle now; who is he? Why does he talk &s;o much about Fortifications and Be&s;ieging?</P>
<P>A'nt we at War now? A'nt our Fleets going out upon a &s;ecret Ex|pedition? So do the old Fellow and <HI>Trim,</HI> they are to have a Siege in private, upon the Bowling-green: It's covered with tall Hedges, and thick-&s;et Shrubs;&mdash;that's Bu&s;h-fighting, as the <HI>Indians</HI> do&mdash;<HI>Brad|dock</HI>'s Affair.</P>
<P>A full-wigg'd Figure, who had been &s;melling to a Piece of burn'd Cork, while this Conver&s;ation was circulating,&mdash;lifted up his Head &s;ud|denly,&mdash;alarm'd by the Bottle being pu&s;h'd clo&s;e to his Forehead.&mdash;As he fill'd his Bumper, thus he held forth;&mdash;<HI>Repugnantibus omnibus,</HI> I declare this&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;<HI>Tri&s;tram,</HI> to be a Piece of Profanene&s;s,&mdash;but the Pre&s;s
<PB N="viii" REF="12">groans with Profanity;&mdash;good Books are made wa&s;te Paper of, and the <HI>Reviewers,</HI> gilt and letter'd, <HI>O Tempora, o Mores.</HI></P>
<P>Have you read the two Volumes?</P>
<P>No, Sir, God forbid; for as St. <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> repented, becau&s;e that he had read <HI>Virgil;</HI> yea, confe&s;s'd it was a Sin, and humbled him&s;elf accord|ingly, even &s;o &s;hou'd <HI>I</HI> account it <HI>my</HI> Self, was <HI>I</HI> to read &s;uch Impie|ties,&mdash;I have heard enough of it:&mdash;There's a Sermon in it,&mdash;and how is that Sermon introduc'd;&mdash;it fall|eth to the Ground,&mdash;falls out from a Book of Fortification too.&mdash;Well may it be &s;aid&mdash;Religion thou ha&s;t lo&s;t thy Bulwarks:&mdash;And then to be read by a Corporal; Why mu&s;t a Corporal read it?</P>
<P><HI>The Baronet for the la&s;t Time.</HI> It does not &s;ignify an Apple-paring, who reads it. I like a Book well
<PB N="ix" REF="13">enough, ju&s;t to amu&s;e, to kill Time, when one has no Company, and it rains,&mdash;or&mdash;a Book then is the Thing. That makes me always have them at Hand; you &s;ee the Gla&s;s-ca&s;e is full of them; and as they are &s;o elegantly ornamented, they make a very pretty Show thro' the Sa&s;hes. But the Books them|&s;elves are very entertaining; they are the <HI>Gentleman,</HI> and <HI>London Ma|gazines;</HI>&mdash;I chu&s;e them becau&s;e we may leave off when we plea&s;e, and begin any where el&s;e, without trou|bling our Memory.&mdash;I a&s;&s;ure you <HI>Magazines</HI> are very u&s;eful. There's <HI>Bella</HI> &s;tudies the Sciences by them; &s;he is now but 14, yet by their Help, &s;he has gone thro' A&s;tronomy, and the Doctrine of Comets, and is now a va&s;t way in natural Philo&s;ophy; and I don't doubt, very &s;oon, but &s;he'll be able to practice Experimental.&mdash;But we've had enough about Books.&mdash;The Weather's fine,&mdash;the Sun is gone on t'other Side the Hou&s;e.&mdash;
<PB N="x" REF="14"><HI>John,</HI> bring Pipes and Tobacco upon the Bowling-green.</P>
<P>This, Sir, was all I cou'd collect that Vi&s;it. Now, altho' they were great People, and rich People, and fine People, and &s;poke very fa&s;t, and very loud, and very often all together; I'm not po&s;itive they ex|plain'd you properly. But for that, to be certain, we mu&s;t wait, until you are plea&s;ed to honour us with your Exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Whenever you think fit to be vi|&s;ible, Sir, I &s;hall be proud to drink with you, to our better Acquain|tance; and I promi&s;e to &s;hew you as great an Oddity, as ever any of the <HI>Shandean</HI> Race exhibited; as much the Sport of Fortune, and one who has made as much Sport too.</P>
<P>I hope the Readers of <HI>Tom Fool</HI> (if he has any Readers) will not find Fault with the en&s;uing Work, until they have found out its Mean|ing.
<PB N="xi" REF="15">&mdash;But when will that be, Mr. <HI>Fool?</HI>&mdash;Don't be in too much Hurry, good Reader.&mdash;Do you think we can get to <HI>Cambridge</HI> to Night?&mdash;Yes, Gentlemen, if you don't make &s;o much Ha&s;te.

<P>And now once more, and for aye, to Mr. <HI>Tri&s;tram Shandy.</HI> You may be &s;urpri&s;ed, Sir, that I &s;hou'd ad|dre&s;s my&s;elf to you; it &s;eems as if I wou'd follow the Examples of Quacks, who, to vend their mi&s;era|ble Compo&s;itions, fix &s;ome famous Name to the Top of their Bills; or that I had no other way to rai&s;e the

<P>This was not <HI>altogether</HI> the Ca&s;e; no, Sir, I addre&s;s'd my&s;elf to you, from the Anti-&s;imilarity of our pre|&s;ent Conditions: Many People are in a Hurry to have you born; many People are in Ha&s;te to have me bu|ried.

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF TOM FOOL.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>_VARIOUS are the Opinions of Authors, concerning the Origin of this Family. Some &s;uppo&s;e it derived from a Ba&s;tard of the <HI>Phrygian Tho|gorma,</HI> as <HI>Vo&s;&s;ius, Cau&s;abon,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Others relate it was an adopted Child, Son to the Wet-nur&s;e of <HI>A&s;cenez</HI> the <HI>Ar|menian,</HI> who founded the Kingdom of <HI>Thrace,</HI> and was the fir&s;t Monarch, as
<PB N="2" REF="18"><HI>Gronovius</HI> reports, who kept Fools about him for State; ju&s;t as the Fa&s;hion is now to keep Women of the Town for Shew.</P>
<P>The <HI>Italians</HI> think us a Nation of Fools; but that Opinion aro&s;e from the Ingratitude of their Eunuchs and Fid|dle-players; who, after getting ten or fifteen Thou&s;and Pounds here, in about &s;ix or &s;even Years time, return to their own Country, build them&s;elves fine Hou&s;es, and over the Street-door, or Porch, they all put up this In&s;cription: ANG. STUL, AED. That is; THE FOLLY OF THE ENGLISH PEOPLE ERECTED THIS BUILDING.</P>
<P>Now the Multitude of <HI>French</HI> People who live among us, in the different Avo|cations of Cooks, Governe&s;&s;es, Pimps, Hair-cutters, Prie&s;ts, Spies, Dancing-ma&s;ters and Card-players, dare not openly call us Fools; but they make u&s;e of a Term equally deriding. They call an <HI>Engli&s;hman, Jack o Roa&s;t Beef,</HI> which &s;ignifies, in their Language, <HI>Jack an Apes;</HI> for they receive it as an uncontro|verted Point of Belief, that no Per&s;ons, but Fools, would feed upon roa&s;t Beef; or, that feeding upon roa&s;t Beef, makes us all &s;o.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="19">
<P>Indeed there are &s;everal Branches of the Fools among us; it is the mo&s;t pro|lific Family exi&s;ting. Nature making amends for the Deficiency of Head, by a Superabundancy in other Parts.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain what Kingdom the Family of the Fools mo&s;t properly appertains to; like the Origin of the venereal Di&s;ea&s;e, each Country gives it to the next; therefore I am of the &s;ame Opinion with <HI>Cambden</HI> and Sir <HI>William Dugdale,</HI> who a&s;&s;ert, that the Title, Fool, or <HI>la Foole,</HI> is like Cuckold, and <HI>Homo,</HI> a Name common to all Men.</P>
<P>The Hero of this Hi&s;tory was Son to Sir <HI>Philpot Fool;</HI> a Gentleman de&s;cended from the amorous <HI>la Fools.</HI> He had a va&s;t E&s;tate, and did a va&s;t deal of Good; for he kept open Hou&s;e every Election, and never &s;at down to Dinner without &s;ome of the neighbouring Gentry or Clergy taking a Bit and a Bottle with him. It is ill Breeding not to drink with your Friends; therefore Sir <HI>Philpot</HI> making a Point of it (being the be&s;t bred Man in the World) his Friends were al|ways drunk with him.</P>
<P>To this Day they tell many merry Stories of the mad Pranks played at his Hou&s;e; and there is to be &s;een at the Par&s;onage, the true Portraits of him and
<PB N="4" REF="20">his Companions, with an In&s;cription un|der each, denoting the Accompli&s;h|ments wherein they excelled; and for which they were tran&s;mitted down fa|mous to Po&s;terity.</P>
<P><HI>Imprimis.</HI> The Baronet; he once drank 22 Pints of Milk-punch before Break|fa&s;t; and could carry a red-hot Poker round the Room betwixt his Teeth.</P>
<P N="2">2d. Was Par&s;on <HI>Squab,</HI> a &s;ix Bottle Man, and the be&s;t Player at Buzz in &s;even Counties.</P>
<P N="3">3d. Was 'Squire <HI>Squelch,</HI> the great Brandy-drinker. He could bite an Inch of Tobacca-pipe into 32 regular Pieces.</P>
<P N="4">4th. Was Mr. <HI>Stale,</HI> the <HI>October</HI> Man. He could &s;tand three Minutes upon one Leg on a Quart Bottle.</P>
<P N="5">5th. Was <HI>Tom Tartar,</HI> the Whetter. He could &s;ay the Belief backwards.</P>
<P>The la&s;t was <HI>George Jolly,</HI> the Half-pinter; who could chalk under-leg far|ther than any Man in the North of <HI>En|gland.</HI> There never was &s;uch a Set to|gether before, nor &s;ince. They were as famous as <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great; <HI>Black-beard,</HI> the Pirate: <HI>Lewis</HI> the Fourteenth, or the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Wire-dancer.</P>
<P>When <HI>Tom</HI> was big enough to go to School, Sir <HI>Philpot</HI> determined to make Choice of a Ma&s;ter for him; but not by
<PB N="5" REF="21">any Per&s;on's Recommendation. No, he knew the World: was not to be hum|med; People will be partial to their Friends, and puff them off, therefore he would him&s;elf judge of their Merits. But the Gout would not then permit him to conver&s;e with any of them, <HI>viva voce;</HI> and he was at a Lo&s;s where to meet with any living Schoolma&s;ter's Works worth looking into. For, upon my Ho|nour (ob&s;erved the Baronet) their put|ting together &s;pelling Books, Dictiona|ries, numerical Pieces, electrical Ob&s;erva|tions, and Aenigmas in the Lady's Di|ary, makes me &s;ick. There is not one of them can pen a good Adverti&s;ement. The calling for the News-papers, he &s;wore his Son &s;hould be &s;ent to that Ma&s;ter who&s;e Stile was the mo&s;t cla&s;&s;i|cal. After a little Search, he met with one beginning thus. <Q>Juveniles inducted &startq;through all the Rudiments, Theo|rems, &endq;Corollaries, Syllogi&s;ms, Po&s;|tulatas</Q>&mdash;Ay, ay, this will do, this will do, Sir <HI>Philpot</HI> cried out; and ringing the Bell, ordered two Hor&s;es to be &s;addled immediately, and his Son was &s;ent that Day to be educated under the Au|thor of the above-mentioned Paragraph.</P>
<P><HI>Tom,</HI> by the Openne&s;s of his Di&s;po&s;i|tion, became the Butt of the whole
<PB N="6" REF="22">School. The elder Scholars availed them&s;elves of his Simplicity; when he had Money, they borrowed it; when he had a Pre&s;ent, they &s;hared it: He &s;oon acquired the Nick-name of good-natur'd <HI>Tom.</HI> Ju&s;t as People in high and low Life characteri&s;e their Friends, by the Appellations of &s;tuttering <HI>Sam,</HI> limping <HI>Joe,</HI> deaf <HI>Harry, Bob</HI> the Au|thor, or Scholar <HI>Will.</HI> For Perfections, or Imperfections, are equally Objects of Contempt and Ridicule. No Wonder, then, that <HI>Tom's</HI> Nick-name grew into a Proverb; and hence we can account for the Synonomy between the Terms of Fool, and good-natur'd Fellow.</P>
<P><HI>Tom Fool</HI>'s Mi&s;tre&s;s hated him, be|cau&s;e he was a better Scholar than her Nephew. Be&s;ides, he would never clean her Cloggs, which the other Boys were always &s;triving to do; then the Boarders u&s;ed to get to Bed to the Maid Servants, and <HI>Tom</HI> would not; &s;o the Girls hated him. He led a &s;ad Life among them; though the be&s;t Boy in the School, he was u&s;ed as the greate&s;t Delinquent; &s;o true it is, what that great Metaphy&s;i|cian, <HI>Virgilius Maro,</HI> has ob&s;erved, that one Man may &s;teal a Hor&s;e &s;afer than another &s;quint over a Hedge-row.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>THERE lived near the Place an old Woman, Ginger-bread Seller to the junior School-boys; to her <HI>Tom Fool</HI> went one Morning very melan|choly, and when &s;he enquired what made him &s;o ca&s;t down; he replied, <Q>&startq;Indeed, Dame, I am not well u&s;ed; every Body at our Hou&s;e takes again&s;t me, and yet I always do my Ta&s;k; and there are a great many Gentle|mens Sons at our School, be&s;ides me, and they never mind their Books; only <HI>Tom Fool,</HI> and only <HI>Tom Fool</HI> is &endq;ill u&s;ed for it; Is not that very hard?</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Indeed, it is (an&s;wered the old Wo|man) but don't cry, you'll make a &endq;better Man than the be&s;t of them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Lord, Dame, what &s;ignifies what Sort of a Man I make? If my Papa had but left me a Fortune; I a'nt &s;uch a Fool, neither, I know that. (Thus <HI>Tom</HI> went on) Why, it was but Ye&s;terday you &s;aw tho&s;e two Gentle|men all over Lace, that got us half a Holiday. For all they looked &s;o fine, and my Ma&s;ter and our U&s;her made them &s;o many Bows; why, they could neither of them read <HI>Era&s;mus.</HI> I &s;aw
<PB N="8" REF="24">them both look over one that lay in <HI>Billy Birch</HI>'s Place; and one &s;aid to the other (&s;wearing a great Oath) Prithee, <HI>Jack,</HI> What Book is this? You came from College &s;ince me, and you know I never &s;tudied any Cla&s;&s;ics, but <HI>Bacchus</HI> and <HI>Venus;</HI> and, indeed, Dame, they are not Books, but a Heathen God and Godde&s;s; then the other made An&s;wer, turning over a Leaf or two, This, this, this, is an intimate Acquaintance of mine; dear <HI>Cicero,</HI> many an Hour have I &s;pent with him: Ay, ay, this is his Oration again&s;t <HI>Hippoplanus,</HI> one of the Triumvirate. Now you mu&s;t know, Dame, this was only a Story in <HI>Era&s;mus,</HI> about a Hor&s;e Jockey; but they knew no better; for the other cur&s;ing him&s;elf (for they cur&s;ed and &s;wore at every Word) Well, &s;ays he, <HI>Jack,</HI> its a Wonder to me, how you can remember &s;o much; for, I don't think, all the Time we were at <HI>Queen</HI>'s together, you went to Bed one Night &s;ober, except the Month we lodged at the Surgeon's. So I told my Ma|&s;ter and our U&s;her about this, and they huffed me, and &s;aid I was a Fool; and then they met the two Gentlemen again, and made them a
<PB N="9" REF="25">great many more Bows; and told their Honours (as they called them) that their Honours were great Scho|lars. But I don't believe, either of their Honours know what Part of &endq;Speech <HI>Bonitas</HI> is.</Q></P>

<P><Q>&startq;Say, Dame, I was &s;ent for up into the Parlour, and my Ma&s;ter's Wife began upon me, So Mr. Critic, the&s;e Gentlemen were not Scholars good enough for you? Indeed, Madam, I &s;aid&mdash;but &s;he would not let me go on, but &s;tamping her Foot, and look|ing as red in the Face, as if &s;he had ju&s;t dre&s;&s;ed Dinner; What, &s;ays &s;he, am I to be interrupted by &s;uch an in|&s;ignificant Thing as thee art? A Ho|liday? Yes, &s;o you &s;hall have one. My Dear, I in&s;i&s;t upon his being locked up in the Wood-room this Moment, till Bed-time. Don't you think, Mr. <HI>Minus</HI> (&s;peaking to our U&s;her) that he de&s;erves it? Why, really (&s;ays he) the Boy has incurred a &s;ingular Puni&s;hment, in Re&s;pect,
<PB N="10" REF="26">that his Crime is duplex or bifold; (I remember the very Words, Dame) it was a Piece of Prophanene&s;s, for a &s;notty-no&s;ed Urchin like him, to depreciate the Erudition of either the honourable Mr. <HI>William,</HI> or his Honour, Sir <HI>Thomas.</HI> Why, Ma|dam, they have the Right of Pre&s;en|tation to Livings of 1200 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> <HI>per &endq;Annum.</HI></Q></P>

<P><HI>Tom</HI> was as good as his Word, for he immediately went to Mr. <HI>Frivil,</HI> the Philo&s;ophical Lecturer, who had main|tained <HI>Tom</HI> at School after the Decea&s;e of Sir <HI>Philpot.</HI> Mr. <HI>Frivil</HI> was Keeper of the Cockle-&s;hells to Lady Dowager <HI>Grotto;</HI> and, on <HI>Tom Fool</HI>'s coming to him, he made him his Fungus gatherer.</P>

<P>ON <HI>Sunday</HI> Evening, ju&s;t as Lady <HI>Grott</HI> was &s;et down to the Bragg Table, a Me&s;&s;enger came to inform her, that Sir <HI>Ta&s;ty,</HI> her Son and Heir, was arrived in <HI>London</HI> from his Travels, and propo&s;ed being down at the Hall in about three Weeks. Immediately Orders were given for his Reception; every Per&s;on in the Family was full of Expectations to &s;ee what a fine Gentleman Ma&s;ter was grown; as great Expectations had been rai&s;ed about him in <HI>London,</HI> before his Arrival there. The noted Pimps had prepared new Faces for him; the Garn|blers made Preparations for him; the tip-top Women of the Town prepared them&s;elves for him, and the Surgeons were in Expectation when he &s;hould be prepared for them.</P>
<P>After the 'Baronet had properly run through all the Ta&s;te Emoluments, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;ub&s;cribing to Mr. <HI>Pond</HI> and the Opera, Hazard, Critici&s;ing, Pitting, Challeng|ing, Turtle-eating, beating the Rounds, Keeping, Bagnios and Injections, he ar|rived at his Birth-place. The Bells rung, the Ale was given away, the Clergy dined, the Gentry danced, and, accord|ing
<PB N="13" REF="29">to the News-Papers, the Evening concluded, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>In a few Days after Sir <HI>Ta&s;ty</HI>'s Ar|rival, Mi&s;s &s;poke to her Brother in Prai&s;e of <HI>Tom</HI>'s Diligence; the Baronet ordered him to be called up, and liking his An&s;wers, made him immediately his Cockchafer Feeder.</P>
<P><HI>Tom</HI> &s;oon grew to be the be&s;t Feeder in the Country; his Chafers would &s;pin longe&s;t, and he was very remarkable for one particular Sort; they were the din|gey-blue-brindled Gingers; and herein I mu&s;t di&s;&s;ent from the learned <HI>Bootle|rius,</HI> tho' he was often a Witne&s;s of their Copulations (as him&s;elf ob&s;erves) yet he mu&s;t be mi&s;taken, when he a&s;&s;erts the Nutmeg-grey-pyeball-flea-bitten-bra&s;s-wings to be the be&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Tom</HI>'s Way of trying a new Sort was thus; as &s;oon as he found a Ne&s;t, he took one of the full-grown Ones, and &s;ticking a Hook through it's Tail, hung it with its Head downwards, and then began to prick it with a Pin; now if the Chafer &s;pun till it was dead, it was a good Ne&s;t, and <HI>Tom</HI> kept the whole Brood to do the &s;ame; but if it would not &s;pin till it was dead, but die Dung|hill, bleed to Death without turning, then <HI>Tom</HI> took them (by his Honour's
<PB N="14" REF="30">Order) and threw them into the Hog|&s;ty, for the Pigs to devour.</P>
<P>One Day, as <HI>Tom</HI> was Chafer-hunt|ing, he found under a &s;hady Hedge, a young Woman &s;eemingly very faint, and by her two Children, the elde&s;t not above two Years of Age.</P>
<P>She made her Ca&s;e known to him; upon the In&s;tant he ran to a Farm-hou&s;e ju&s;t by, got his Coat-lap full of Victuals, and a Jug of Beer in his Hand, down he &s;at, and dined with the poor half-fa|mi&s;hed Travellers.</P>
<P>After <HI>Tom</HI> had cagged up his Chafers, Mr. <HI>Vo&s;s</HI> came by; People of his Cloth are very curious; he demanded to know what <HI>Tom</HI> was after. Young <HI>Fool</HI> ex|plained to him what his Bu&s;ine&s;s was of Cock-chafering, which made Mr. <HI>Vo&s;s,</HI> lifting up his Hands and Eyes, thus de|liver him&s;elf.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Is it po&s;&s;ible? Can Men delight in &s;uch excruciating Amu&s;ements? O Animals of Infelicity! O ye hard of Heart, ye Time de&s;troying Inqui&s;i|tors! Do the&s;e Reptile we torture, wrong us? Are they able to cope with us? Should we not rather a&s;&s;i&s;t the Weak? Does not our holy Religion teach us? Mu&s;t not we cheri&s;h the
<PB N="15" REF="31">Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed? Are we not commanded &endq;to relieve the Wretched?</Q></P>
<P>After the Gentleman had fini&s;hed his Declamation, young <HI>Fool</HI> addre&s;&s;ed him in Behalf of the poor Woman and her two Infants; begging the Vicar to give her Half-a-Crown. Mr. <HI>Vo&s;s</HI> reddened at the In&s;olence of the Demand; but then reflecting who &s;poke it, and for whom it was &s;poke, his Re&s;entment &s;ub|&s;ided into Contempt; and darting a Sneer as he &s;ide-long glanced his Eyes on &s;uch low-life Objects, he &s;purred on his Hor&s;e, calling out, Oh Fool! Fool! <HI>Tom Fool,</HI> indeed.</P>
<P><HI>Tom</HI> conducted the poor Woman to the Town, where his Ma&s;ter, Sir <HI>Ta&s;ty,</HI> kept his Chafers. On the Road &s;he told him that was the Place of her Nativity; for <HI>Tom</HI> had not minutely enquired into her Story; becau&s;e, as Mr. <HI>Metaphor,</HI> his Schoolma&s;ter, ob&s;erved, repeating Di&s;|tre&s;&s;es, is only chewing the Cud of Mis|fortunes. Away walked <HI>Tom</HI> with the two Children, that their Mother might come on the fa&s;ter; and leaving the Fa|mily in the Public Hou&s;e he twirled his Chafers at, he ran up Town to make a Collection for them, telling every one he a&s;ked, how happy he thought him|&s;elf,
<PB N="16" REF="32">to be out that Day, or el&s;e the poor Babes might have been &s;tarved.</P>
<P>He got Money, more or le&s;s, from every one he petitioned, he was &s;o be|loved; the Town's-folks all declared, it was out of Regard to him, that they gave the Money; as to the Beggar-Wench and her Brats, they were no|thing to them, neither did they care what became of them; which is, in|deed, a prudent and proper Way of Thinking; and the only Way I know of, to prevent the Pre&s;ervation of tho&s;e Swarms of Indigents, which, at pre|&s;ent, infe&s;t the more happy Inhabitants of this Metropolis; and, I humbly move, that the Clergy, Gentry, and Men of Learning, will, hereafter, be as &s;tre|nuous in their Endeavours to cancel all Symptoms of Pity among their Ac|quaintance, Dependants and Menials, as they have been to bani&s;h the Remains of Wit and Humour. So &s;hall we &s;oon arrive at that noble Ferocity, which was &s;o con&s;picuous in the Sentiments and Be|haviours of our great great Grandfa|thers, the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals</HI></P>

<P>For Ma&s;ter <HI>Billy Thrumm</HI> being ju&s;t out of his Time, his Mamma was re|&s;olved to have a Rout to celebrate his Freedom; and her Spou&s;e, Mr. <HI>Church|warden,</HI> dealing in Rabbit Skins, and the Warehou&s;e at that Time being empty, &s;he in&s;i&s;ted upon having the Card-tables &s;pread there; becau&s;e, &s;he &s;aid, <HI>it was a &s;weetfuller Place, than where Madam.</HI> Hip&s;hott <HI>the Over&s;eer's Wife kept her's; for all Madam</HI> Hip&s;hott <HI>'s Vi&s;itors played at Cards in the Place where Mr.</HI> Hip&s;hott <HI>made his Candles, and it &s;melt wor&s;erer nor A&s;i&s;ettiti.</HI></P>
<P>With a becoming Dignity Mrs. <HI>Flims</HI> &s;tepped from the Po&s;t Chariot; and with equal Grace Madam <HI>Thrumm</HI> re|ceived her at the Shop-door, u&s;hered her along Side the Counter, kicked the empty Butter Firkins out of the Way, &s;colded her Apprentice for not removing

I could not be &s;o ill-bred to deny our Sex|ton's Wife, &s;o I went; it was but two Doors off, and I intended to rate the Hu&s;&s;y for her Imporance, to bring her Ba&s;tards upon my Hu&s;band's Pari&s;h; but, indeed, when I came to &s;ee the Children, they looked pretty enough to be of an hone&s;t Man's getting; and then

Why, it was but t'other Day, our Shepherd was &s;tanding again&s;t our Pantry Window with his Wife, as he calls her; and &s;he had the Confidence to give him a Ki&s;s, and told him &s;he loved him; as if &s;uch Animals as &s;he could love, or was made to love; or had any Bu&s;ine&s;s with what belonged to their

When they found <HI>Tom Fool</HI> rejoicing, as before-mentioned, him they added to their Party, and be|hind them marched the Beadle, &s;ent by the Churchwarden to know what Ne|ce&s;&s;aries the Children wanted; and Ma|dam <HI>Thrum</HI> was ordered by her Hu&s;|band to wait upon the young Lady;&mdash;but alas, whatever Authority he might have in the Ve&s;try,&mdash;at Home, like other great Men, he doff'd his Habile|ments of Power. As &s;oon as he had or|dered her to go and wait upon Mi&s;s <HI>Bonville,</HI> to know her Commands, a &s;udden Scowl gloomed over Madam <HI>Thrum</HI>'s Face; &s;he knit her Brows, &s;he clapped her Palms together;&mdash;he knew the Symptoms, and he &s;hunned the Storm; unboxing his large buckled Wig and be&s;t Beaver, he took his Ivory-headed Cane from behind the Counter,
<PB N="29" REF="45">and, with the Tranquility of Farmer <HI>Cincinatus,</HI> went to Mi&s;s <HI>Bonville</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>After the Vi&s;it was paid, Mr. Over|&s;eer took <HI>Tom Fool</HI> home with him to Dinner; Madam <HI>Hip&s;hott</HI> received young <HI>Fool</HI> with the utmo&s;t Complai&s;ance; for this Lady had conceived an Inclination for him, not fitting for the Mode&s;ty of Hi&s;torians to relate. After the Cloth was rumpled away, the Lady of the Fea&s;t brought a large Bowl of Punch upon the Table, in which &s;he had in|fu&s;ed a more than ordinary Quantity of Spirits; de&s;igning, by the Strength of the Potation, to prevent her Hu&s;band from ob&s;erving what might pa&s;s be|tween her and <HI>Tom Fool.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Over&s;eer complained of the Li|quor, it was too &s;trong, he &s;wore; but Madam <HI>Hip&s;hott</HI> in&s;i&s;ting on it, that it was no &s;tronger than common, he was forced to &s;wallow his Bumper and be quiet.</P>
<P>Young <HI>Fool,</HI> who never drank any Thing but Water, was blamed by the Over&s;eer, for being a Milk-&s;op; and Mr. <HI>Hip&s;hott</HI> declared, he would make <HI>Tom</HI> drink now, he'd enter him, he'd &s;hew him what it was to be an hone&s;t Fellow.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="46">
<P>His Spou&s;e &s;tood up in Defence of her <HI>Adonis;</HI> prote&s;ting, &s;he'd drink for him; depending upon her own Strength, by which not only her&s;elf, but too many of her Sex.&mdash;O Ladies, Ladies, let me beg of you hereafter not to rely too much on the Potency of your own ab&s;olute Sovereignties; like her confiding, like her, perhaps, you'll fall; prone on the Floor &s;he dropped acro&s;s her &s;peechle&s;s Hu&s;band's Carca&s;e inanimated. Thus you may have &s;een in a Block-maker's Yard, two wooden Figures de&s;igned for Heads of Ships, tumbled one thwart t'other; lifele&s;s and ill-&s;haped.</P>

<P>MR. <HI>Vo&s;s,</HI> who had lately met with <HI>Tom Fool,</HI> as before related, this Day dined at the Baronet's.

<P>This may be looked on as a &s;trange Recommendation by tho&s;e odd People who don't under&s;tand the World. But Mr. <HI>Vo&s;s</HI> was right, Who would lo&s;e a good Living, for Want of looking af|ter it? Strangers entered for <HI>Olympic</HI> Prizes, and therefore&mdash;but as there is Variation between ancient and modern Honour, &s;o there is between ancient and modern Preferment.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Vo&s;s</HI> li&s;tened with the utmo&s;t &s;eem|ing Attention to Mi&s;s <HI>Fa&s;h,</HI> while &s;he related <HI>Tom</HI>'s Humanity to Mi&s;s <HI>Bon|ville.</HI> Finding what a Favorite <HI>Tom</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="48">was in the Family; he extolled the Be|nevolence of the young Man's Di&s;po&s;i|tion; prote&s;ting, that the Youth had an angelic Mind. For Ladies (continued Mr. <HI>Vo&s;s</HI>) Charity, Charity, is the ine&s;|timable Attribute of the human Spe|cie.&mdash;Action ineffable.&mdash;The all irradi|ating Sun benevolates his Bounties uni|ver&s;al.

<P>Then don't let us lo&s;e a Moment (his Honour replied) drink about, the Wo|men have all given their Sentiments&mdash;Come here's&mdash;Mi&s;s <HI>Fa&s;h</HI> gave a Shriek, to prevent her Brother's going on, clap|ping her Hands to her Head, cried out, for Heaven's Sake, dear Brother, don't be rude&mdash;I know what you are going to &s;ay; but pray let us be out of the Hear|ing on't fir&s;t.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Ta&s;ty.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, go and &s;end my Groom in with the two Pointers he brought Home

<P>Why, then, Sir, you are a very knowing Fellow, for I am one of the be&s;t Shots in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Baronet then clapped Mr. <HI>Vo&s;s</HI> on the Thigh, &s;hook him heartily by the Hand, &s;wore he was a damn'd hone&s;t Fellow, quite the Thing, and carried him to &s;ee his Chafers. Mr. <HI>Vo&s;s</HI> lifted up his Eyes and Hands in Admiration of the young Baronet's great Talents; and gra&s;ping Sir <HI>Ta&s;ty</HI>'s Hand, cried out, <HI>Go on, Sir, pur&s;ue thus the Study of Na|ture; delicately, minutely enter into her Predicaments, by the Analy&s;is of Creation's &s;malle&s;t Productions; 'twas by the&s;e, and other as noble Searches, Re&s;earches and In|ve&s;tigations, that our Royal Society has gained &s;o great a Character, has made &s;uch
<PB N="34" REF="50">ample Di&s;coveries, and has &s;o greatly bene|fitted our Country. Their Enquiries are univer&s;al; and yet I wonder they never cri|tically con&s;idered, if a Man might, or might not &s;pecifically creep into a Bottle; and how long any Lady from</HI> Elizabeth Canning<HI>'s Example may hold out. But, I beg Par|don, Sir</HI> Ta&s;ty, <HI>for this Digre&s;&s;ion, and mu&s;t &s;ay to you, as</HI> Pau&s;anias <HI>did to the younger</HI> Cyrus <HI>upon a &s;imilar Occa&s;ion, wonderful is your Strength of Soul, which makes you impervious to the Fa&s;cination of Delights; encircled with Plea&s;ures, as you are, yet you can attend to &s;uch improving Exerci&s;es, and thus blend the Naturali&s;t with the fine Gentleman.</HI></P>
<P>A Servant then brought them a Sum|mons from the Tea-table; as they en|tered, they found <HI>Tom Fool</HI> relating to the Ladies, what Effect her Lady&s;hip's Letter had among the Pari&s;h Officers.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>IT was Club-night, and Mr. Church|warden, the Chairman, had provid|ed en elegant Supper for the Society, of Tripe and Cow-heels; But how were they to be dre&s;&s;ed? Boiled, or fryed? This Que&s;tion occa&s;ioned much Di&s;&s;en|tion; the evil Spirit Party entered among them with all it's infernal Con|comitants, Oppo&s;ition, Abu&s;e, Envy, Uproar, and much Swearing. But the Landlady's Daughter ob&s;erving, if &s;ome was boiled, and &s;ome was fryed, all might be plea&s;ed.&mdash;It was agreed to; the Members &s;hook Hands, and &s;at down to Supper with great Satisfaction.</P>
<P>The Meal over, and the Pipes filled, the mute Taciturnity incircling Clouds of Smoak &s;ailed round the Room; but Mr. <HI>Ru&s;t,</HI> the Nail-&s;eller, happening to break his Pipe, ju&s;t as he was in the Marrow of it, de&s;troyed the Tranqui|lity all the Club was enjoying, by &s;wearing at the Pipe-makers; &s;aying, <HI>I wonder, &s;o I do, &s;ince they have made Acts of Parliaments for every Thing el&s;e, why there was not one to make Tobacco-pipes &s;tronger; it's a Hard&s;hip upon the Subject they are not &s;o.</HI></P>
<PB N="38" REF="54">
<P>Mr. <HI>Thyll,</HI> as he &s;hovelled up the Cinders, turning his Head half-round to the Right, &s;cowled at him; replying, <HI>What, you are one of your Acts of Par|liament-men, are you? Pray, what Occa|&s;ion is there for any Acts of Parliament? There's your Turnpikes and your Broad-wheels very pretty Acts indeed. I have been a Carrier now this forty Years, I wanted to Turnpikes, nor Broad wheels, neither.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Derivate,</HI> the Schoolma&s;ter, ob|&s;erved, as he was chu&s;ing a clean Pipe; <HI>that, as for Turnpikes, he &s;eldom, for his Part, went abroad; &s;o it was nothing to him, if not one Turnpike was to be erected all over</HI> England. <HI>But,</HI> added he (as he &s;tirred the Punch about) <HI>Broad-wheels are ab&s;olutely and e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary for the Good of the whole Nation, &s;ince no Waggon could now overturn as before, and &s;poil the Goods, as I was &s;erved, having a Ca&s;k of Burton Ale &s;taved, within two Miles of my own Hou&s;e, by the Waggon's over&s;etting, occa&s;ioned by the Want of Broad-wheels.</HI></P>
<P>The Landlord reaching over for the Snuffers, declared, he did not believe that Turnpikes did half &s;o much Harm as Po&s;tchai&s;es. <HI>But they &s;tudy all the Ways they can, to ruin</HI> Old England.
<PB N="39" REF="55"><HI>Our Elections come but once in &s;even Years, unle&s;s occa&s;ioned by a Death, or &s;o; and then it's Odds, if there's an Oppo&s;ition. Now, if we had annual Parliaments, and proper Oppo&s;itions, we mought &s;ay, our Gentlefolks then do Things for the Good of their Country.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Chairman, awakened by the Fall of a Gla&s;s, &s;tared round at his Com|panions, and hearing the Landlord's la&s;t Words; replied, <HI>Good of one's Coun|try; yes, to be &s;ure, catch them at that; no, no, they are all for the Good of the Town; but, come, drink about. I'll give you a Toa&s;t; here's fewer Taxes, and no Placemen; may our Officers by Land and by Sea &s;erve us for nothing; and every Lord in the Land take a Town's 'Prentice.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now you talk of Elections</HI> (Mr. <HI>Lee,</HI> the Soap-boiler ob&s;erved) <HI>Pray, when are our Members to &s;end us the new Bills? But that's Pari&s;h Bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ay, ay, and Pari&s;h Bu&s;ine&s;s is every Body's Bu&s;ine&s;s; and every Body's Bu&s;ine&s;s is no Body's Bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI> This, Mr. <HI>Swill,</HI> &s;tarting up, declared; but, in his Hurry, beat Mr. <HI>Goo&s;e</HI>'s Pipe into his Mouth with one Elbow, and with the other, da&s;hed a Gla&s;s again&s;t Mr. <HI>Flax</HI>'s Teeth, which the quiet Hemp-dre&s;&s;er had ju&s;t rai&s;ed to his Head, in Honour of Mr.

<P><HI>Selfi&s;h People,</HI> replied Mr. <HI>Goo&s;e</HI> (&s;pit|ting out the Fragments of a broken Pipe) <HI>Pray, did'nt you, Mr.</HI> Swill, <HI>put down a new Pump, la&s;t Year, in the School-yard? And did not you new-lead all the Church-windows, becau&s;e you was Churchwarden, and becau&s;e you was Plumber and Glazier?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Yes, I did,</HI> an&s;wered Mr. <HI>Swill,</HI> and, &s;eizing his Bumper, wi&s;hed the Gla&s;s might never go through him, if he did not behave in that, as much for the Good of his Country, as e'er a Man among them all; <HI>For does not all our Pari&s;h fetch Water at that Pump? And is not every Body to receive Benefit by the Church-windows.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Townclerk,</HI> his Brother-in-Law, gave his Opinion next; that, according to my Lord <HI>Cooke</HI> upon <HI>Littleton,</HI> every Man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a Right within him&s;elf, a Kind of Feoffment, or Covert Baton, by which he is entitled to lay, or lie out, Part or Parts of Money, collected by

<P>Fir&s;t went Mr. Churchwarden and Chairman, &s;upported on his Right by a Crutch-headed Stick; and on his Left by the Shoulder of a Stage Coachman, preceded by the Po&s;tilion, bearing the Stable Lanthorn.</P>
<P>Then followed the re&s;t of the Mem|bers, two by two, Arm-link'd in Arm, all but Mr. <HI>Derivate</HI> the School-ma&s;ter; he brought up the Rear; or, to &s;peak more properly, was brought up in the Rear, by his two Bearers, Sir <HI>Ta&s;ty</HI>'s Whipper-in, and little <HI>Sam</HI> the Boot-catcher.

<P><HI>TOM,</HI> the Tap&s;ter, who had been di&s;patched from the main Body of the Club, to &s;ee how the Ladies went on, before a Bumper had gone round, returned affrighted; telling his Ma&s;ter, the Gentlefolks were all fighting; and he heard his Mi&s;tre&s;s &s;cream mo&s;t di&s;|mally. Away went the Landlord, Mr. <HI>Dulter,</HI> to his Wife's A&s;&s;i&s;tance; the re&s;t of the Hu&s;band's following, all but the di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate School-ma&s;ter; it was beneath a Philo&s;opher, he &s;aid, to mind Quarrels; therefore he would keep Cen|try over the Punch-bowl.</P>
<P>The Noi&s;e of the Combatants directed the Gentlemen to the Place of Battle. Mr. <HI>Dulter,</HI> the Publican, was the fir&s;t who entered; as he &s;traddled over the fallen Carca&s;e of Mrs. <HI>Flims,</HI> (who lay parallel to the Thre&s;hold) a Pair of bra&s;s Snuffers violently met his No&s;e, flung from the fair Fi&s;t of the elde&s;t Mi&s;s <HI>Lee.</HI></P>
<P>The Townclerk, who clo&s;e followed Mr. <HI>Dulter,</HI> tripped up the Steps, over Lady <HI>Grott</HI>'s Woman, and tumbling into the Room, pitched his Head (like a battering Ram) again&s;t the Small of the Landlord's Back. The Shock would have &s;ent Mr. <HI>Dulter</HI> to the

<P>A Shriek at that Moment from Mrs. <HI>Swill,</HI> hurried her Spou&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t her; but met in Midway Madam Townclerk, forcible was the Shock that each receiv|ed, Brea&s;t to Brea&s;t, Face to Face &mdash; Backward, brui&s;ed, out of Breath, and &s;peechle&s;s fell the Townclerk's Wife; while <HI>Swill</HI> pur&s;ued his Way. But now the down-fallen Madam <HI>Thrum</HI> &s;eized him by the Ankle; the &s;udden Gripe (like Orchard-robber, caught in Fox|trap) brought him to the Ground; and as he fell, he caught Hold of Madam <HI>Goo&s;e</HI>'s <HI>French</HI> Pocket-hole; the Poplin
<PB N="44" REF="60">Sack and upper Petticoat gave Way, down he tumbled, rending as he &s;unk; while the &s;uffering Lady appeared all on one Side uncloathed (except her Skele|ton Hoop.) She looked like the un|planked Side of a Ship's Stern, with her Ribs all bare.</P>
<P>Madam <HI>Goo&s;e</HI> frantic with the Affront, (like <HI>Hecuba</HI> at the Siege of <HI>Troy</HI>) &s;eized on the fir&s;t Man next her, Mr. <HI>Thrill;</HI> &s;he tore his Chitterlin, kicked his Shins, &s;pit in his Face; he all the While re|treating Back, till he came to the Spot where Madam Townclerk was over|thrown. She was then endeavouring to rai&s;e her&s;elf up, by the Help of her Hands out-&s;pread on the Floor; but ju&s;t then Mr. <HI>Thrill</HI>'s Heel cru&s;hing her Fingers, &s;he fixed her Teeth fa&s;t in the Calf of his Leg; the &s;udden Smart made him raving mad; he fell upon Mrs. <HI>Goo&s;e,</HI> over&s;et the Soap-boiler's Daughter; gave Mrs. <HI>Inkle</HI> a black Eye, and &s;truck every one in his Reach; when &s;ouze o'er his Face a Di&s;h of hot buttered Applepye was &s;ent from the Sideboard by Mrs. <HI>In|kle;</HI> the &s;calding Catapla&s;m &s;tuck to his Features; he roared, he called for Help, he flung his Arms about, and blinded as he was, Mr. <HI>Dulter</HI> ju&s;t then pa&s;&s;ing by him with a large Kettle of boiling
<PB N="45" REF="61">Water, which he had taken off the Fire to prevent Mi&s;chief, Mr. <HI>Thrill</HI> &s;eized the Publican by the hind-part of his Coat-Collar; backwards they both fell; the cover, by the &s;udden Jerk, came off; and the &s;treaming Liquor, &s;pla&s;h|ed, &s;prayed and &s;calded all the inter|mingled Combatants.</P>
<P>The parboiled Gentlemen and Ladies, frighted to Death, as they felt the bli&s;|tering Liquor, left off at once; and af|ter &s;ome Moments recovering their Sen&s;es, rejoicing to find them&s;elves alive, they &s;hook Hands round, agreed to for|get and to forgive, picked up the Over|thrown, and adjourned into the Dwelling-hou&s;e to refre&s;h and refit them&s;elves. There they &s;aw all at his Length &s;tretched out, the much inebriated School-ma|&s;ter; after he was left to him&s;elf, he fell a&s;leep; and dreaming, being hot at Heart, that the Hou&s;e was on Fire, &s;eized the Punch-bowl, by way of Bucket, and da&s;hed it again&s;t the Wain|&s;cot; with the Swing, down he came to the Ground, and there he lay 'mid&s;t Puddles of Punch, and &s;hining Frag|ments of blue and white China.

<P>NOW let me beg of all my Readers, gentle and &s;imple, and all &s;im|ple Gentlefolks, to ob&s;erve, that Gam|ing is one of the &s;even deadly Sins, to all beneath Right Honourables; for it is well known noble Folks never &s;in, un|le&s;s they wave their Privileges &mdash; but to go on with this Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Madam Churchwarden's Vi&s;itants had for &s;everal Hours maintained that be|coming Behavour, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary at the polite&s;t Card-tables. The Conver&s;ation, pertinent to the Evening's Entertainment, was pre&s;erved with an unaffected Free|dom.&mdash;For In&s;tance&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Pray, how came you to be &s;ix? &mdash; Play away&mdash;We are two by Honours&mdash;No, but you a'ant&mdash;You hold a foul Card, Mi&s;s&mdash;I pa&s;s elde&s;t&mdash;Can you one &mdash;Your bea&s;ted, Madam&mdash;Forty-four for Point&mdash;I &s;tand&mdash; Not good&mdash;Three by Cards&mdash;Fi&s;h and Mats &mdash; Pair Royal of Aces&mdash;Call a Card&mdash;King of Hearts &mdash; Spades is Trumps&mdash; Spadille &s;peak&mdash;Who&s;e to deal&mdash;Play a Trump&mdash; We've &s;aved our Lurch&mdash;Highe&s;t and Jack &mdash;Our Game, a Guinea&mdash;Who brags next &mdash;Change Seats,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>

<P>In the Mid&s;t of this agreeable Chat, a Revoke was made by Madam <HI>Thrum,</HI> which threw that Whi&s;t-table into &s;ome Confu&s;ion; and ju&s;t then at the Bragg-table, there happened a Di&s;pute about a leaden Shilling, which no Per&s;on would own; but it was judged to be one of Mrs. Churchwarden's Counters, for her Hu&s;band had taken &s;everal leaden Shil|lings in his Grocery Bu&s;ine&s;s, and nailed them to his Counter; but after his Spou&s;e &s;et up her Rout, &s;he had the Nails drawn, the bad Money bru&s;hed up, and adding three white Metal Tops of Buttons from her Hu&s;band's working Frock, <HI>complicated</HI> (as &s;he &s;aid) one Set of Counters. Twelve <HI>Birmingham</HI> Half|pence, well &s;cowered, made a &s;econd Dozen. The &s;ame Quantity of King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Farthings made the third. Her Brother, the Tinman, made her a Pre|&s;ent of half a Gro&s;s of Fi&s;hes made by his 'Prentice. Thus the Quadrille and Picquet Tables were equipped; but where &s;he played her&s;elf, the Markers &s;he u&s;ed were more valuable; for her Hu&s;band was not only a Grocer and Churchwarden, but al&s;o an Antiquarian; from his Collection &s;he had picked out a Set of his mo&s;t valuable Pieces to &s;core with; <HI>viz.</HI> a Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Shilling,
<PB N="48" REF="64">and <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI>'s Breeches, a <HI>Hol|land</HI> Doit, a King <HI>William</HI>'s and Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Silver Three-pence, two Six-Sti|ver Pieces, a Dollar, a Bra&s;s <HI>Jacobas,</HI> a <HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> Shilling, a Ticket for the King's Road, a Piece of Eight, and an old round Thing of Copper, all honey|comb'd with Ru&s;t, which her Spou&s;e called his <HI>Notho.</HI> But the&s;e &s;he only u&s;ed at public Times, &s;uch as A&s;&s;emblies in the Race Week, the Ball-Night at an Election, and her own Rout.</P>
<P>The leaden Shilling being &s;entenced, as before-mentioned, it was di&s;patched from Mrs. Townclerk, with her Compliments to Madam <HI>Thrum,</HI> and begged her Ho|nour would change it. Now the Me&s;|&s;age being delivered in the critical Mi|nute, when the Revoke was fixed upon her; Is it to be wondered at, that &s;he could not keep her Temper? She did not; but replying, with a &s;hrill Voice, <HI>&s;ome People were in a mighty Hurry for their Money, &s;he was not running away; and that &s;he'd have Madam</HI> Kenting <HI>to know, &s;he knew what good Money was, and had as much on't, thank God, as her Neighbours.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thank God? no, no, thank the Jury,</HI> (retorted Mrs. <HI>Kenting</HI>) <HI>for giving your Hu&s;band five Hundred Pounds Damages,
<PB N="49" REF="65">when you and the Squire were catched in Bed together.</HI></P>
<P>Truth is not to be told at all Times. Mrs. <HI>Thrum</HI> ro&s;e up at the Reproach, all red with Revenge; over&s;etting a Pi|quet Table as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed, the Corner of which fell upon a Leg of Mi&s;s <HI>Fiddy</HI>'s Lapdog, who &s;hook the Air with his Shrieks; but the Churchwarden's Lady crouded on regardle&s;s, and &s;tretching her&s;elf forwards over the Table, &s;pit full in Madam Townclerk's Face; &s;aying, <HI>take that, Huzzy.</HI> The Lady returned the In&s;ult by a blazing Candle, which &s;inged as it &s;tuck, between the &s;mitched Brows of Madam Churchwarden. High in Wrath Mrs. <HI>Kenting</HI> followed her Blow, and da&s;hed the Candle&s;tick in Madam <HI>Thrum</HI>'s Face; who, with bleeding No&s;e, fell backwards on the Floor, murmuring out, Murder! Mur|der!</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>All&s;pice,</HI> who was at the Side-table, eating &s;ome cold Sirloin, &s;eeing her Si&s;ter-in-Law's Di&s;tre&s;s, flung a half picked Bone of Beef at Mrs. <HI>Kenting;</HI> but it his Mi&s;s <HI>Fiddy</HI>'s Forehead, as &s;he was dre&s;&s;ing her Lap-dog's Brui&s;e; the &s;udden Shock made her drop the Puppy, and run bellowing with Hands held up towards the Door; but in her Way &s;he
<PB N="50" REF="66">over&s;et the Shop-boy, who had a large Cu&s;tard in his Hands, Part of which fal|ling on Mi&s;s <HI>Hannah Lee</HI>'s Negligee, &s;o provoked the Soap-boiler's Daughter, that &s;natching up the Dozen of <HI>Birming|ham</HI>'s, &s;he volleyed them at the Head of the unfortunate Mi&s;s <HI>Fiddy;</HI> but they mi&s;&s;ed the young Lady, and Ma|dam <HI>Dulter,</HI> the Publican's Wife, re|ceived a Brui&s;e with &s;ome of the Half|pence over the Wedding-ring Finger, ju&s;t as &s;he was opening her Snuff-box; and as &s;he ro&s;e up at the Stroke, a Pewter Plate &s;kimmed from the Side-board by Mrs. <HI>All&s;pice,</HI> met her full on the Mouth; with hideous Cru&s;h her thee be&s;t Fore|teeth &s;unk on the Floor, Victims to the Pewter Plates &s;uperior Weight of Me|tal. Now the Battle became general; Pompoons, Gawze, Aprons, Double Ruffles, Pa&s;te Ear-rings and Cambrick Tuckers &s;pread the Floor; all were em|ployed in tearing, &s;hrieking, &s;cratching, biting, kicking, crying, &s;pitting; all, except my Lady <HI>Grott</HI>'s Woman; &s;he had &s;ome Time before &s;unk &s;upine a-cro&s;s the Door-way, immer&s;ed in Drink and Sleep; &s;he heeded not the Battle, like the Cabin-boy on the Round-top, re|gardle&s;s &s;lumbered out the Storm.

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<P>FOR &s;ome Days after the Combat abovementioned, neither the Mem|bers of the Club, nor the Members of the Rout, went abroad. Mr. <HI>Thrill</HI>'s Leg was under the Surgeon's Hands; Mi&s;s <HI>Fiddy</HI>'s Dog under the Farriers: Mrs. <HI>Dulter</HI> was a&s;hamed to &s;hew her Face; and Mi&s;s <HI>Lee</HI>'s Sack was gone to be dyed; all the Effects of Gaming&mdash; But we &s;hall leave philo&s;ophizing, and en|quire into the Truth of Mrs. <HI>Flim</HI>'s Re|port concerning Mi&s;s <HI>Fa&s;h,</HI> and her Fondne&s;s for <HI>Tom Fool.</HI></P>
<P>Violently &s;he admired him; the Symp|toms too plainly appeared.&mdash;Lo&s;s of Ap|petite&mdash;Want of Sleep&mdash;An uncommon Fondne&s;s for Solitude, when he was not at the Hall; and an Abhorrence of Cards. Which la&s;t <HI>Sappho</HI> calls the mo&s;t inveterate Diagno&s;tic.</P>
<P>Poor young Lady, how was her Mind divided, between plea&s;ing her Fancy, and Honour, and Reputation, and a charm|ing Fellow, and Coaches and &s;ix, and Child-bed Linnen; &s;he &s;truggled va&s;tly; but it was ea&s;y to gue&s;s who would prove the be&s;t Wre&s;tler. Pride, indeed, held her up &s;ome Time; and Fear kept her
<PB N="53" REF="69">a little upon her Legs; but Love, at la&s;t, Love got the better.&mdash;Love, the mo&s;t powerful of the Pa&s;&s;ions, like Death, like Drunkenne&s;s, or a hot Spring Tide, Love is an univer&s;al Leveller.</P>
<P>At this Time <HI>Tom</HI> was with her Bro|ther at a great Twirling Match; but &s;he re&s;olved, as &s;oon as young <HI>Fool</HI> returned, to break her Mind by Letter to him.</P>
<P>At this Meeting all the principal Folks of the Country were a&s;&s;embled; among whom Mr. <HI>Yea&s;t</HI> cut no incon&s;i|derable Figure; he was looked upon to be the proude&s;t Man in the World, and indeed he had Rea&s;ons for it; he was re|lated to a noble Family, had a great E&s;|tate of his own, be&s;ides a large Cathedral Income; he was a Humori&s;t, for he kept two Men in Labourers Pay, who&s;e whole Bu&s;ine&s;s con&s;i&s;ted in driving poor People, Neighbours, as well as Strangers, from his Pales, Stables and Outhou&s;es. Lea&s;t (as he &s;aid) the Wretches &s;hould bring &s;ome infectious Di&s;temper into his Fa|mily. Yet this was not done out of Co|vetou&s;ne&s;s, for he once &s;pent ten Thou|&s;and Pounds at an Election, to &s;upport an Oppo&s;ition; becau&s;e the old Member had contradicted him at the Quarter Se&s;|&s;ions. This Gentleman threatened to cane <HI>Tom Fool,</HI> for challenging a Chafer
<PB N="54" REF="70">Mr. <HI>Yea&s;t</HI>'s Man had pitted; <HI>Tom</HI> in&s;i&s;t|ing on it to be Sir <HI>Ta&s;ty</HI>'s Breed.</P>
<P>The young Baronet, every Evening when the Twirling was over, u&s;ed to re|turn to Town to vi&s;it Mi&s;s <HI>Bonville,</HI> and left <HI>Tom</HI> there. Mr. <HI>Yea&s;t</HI> found young <HI>Fool</HI> in a Parlour of the Inn by him&s;elf; upon which, reddening with Rage, and clubbing his Whip, he called out, <HI>Sir|rah, you Ra&s;cal, down on your Knees and a&s;k me Pardon, for that audacious Lie you told To-day, about my Chafers, or I'll break every Bone in your Skin, you Bougre.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tom,</HI> not being u&s;ed to &s;uch Threats, replied cooly, <HI>What Right have you to break my Bones, Sir? What Right, you Scoundrel? What Right? Shall &s;uch Scums of the Earth, as you, a&s;k me what Right?</HI> Mr. <HI>Yea&s;t</HI> could &s;ay no more; he was choaked with Pa&s;&s;ion; black in the Face he looked like a half-&s;trangled Turkey Cock; and like that angry Animal, he flew at <HI>Tom Fool,</HI> aiming a Blow with his heavy handled Whip. <HI>Tom</HI> nimbly avoided the Stroke; Mr. <HI>Yea&s;t</HI> over|reaching him&s;elf, fell down, Face fore|mo&s;t, &s;triking his Forehead again&s;t the Edge of a two-ear'd Pewter Uten&s;il, which happened to be placed Wai&s;tband high on two Brackets, in the Corner of the Room where he fell.</P>
<PB N="55" REF="71">
<P><HI>Tom</HI> turning round, re&s;olved not to be beat tamely, and &s;eized the Whip. The Pain of his Forehead, and Fear of <HI>Fool,</HI> who &s;eemed determined to exer|ci&s;e the new gained Weapon, made Mr. <HI>Yea&s;t</HI> roar out for Help; the Servants ru&s;hed in, picked up this very proud Man, and put him to Bed. All the Time he was undre&s;&s;ing, he vowed Re|venge again&s;t poor <HI>Tom;</HI> and that as God &s;hould &s;pare his Life, he never would leave him, till he got him tran|&s;ported to the wor&s;t of his Maje&s;ty's Plantations.</P>
<P>Bearing Malice is not one of the thirty-nine Articles, to be &s;ure.&mdash;But, alas, who can help it? We are not all of us, as every body ought to be. Sin and Folly are two very leading Fa&s;hions, and many People appear in each, not out of weak or bad Minds, but merely out of Politene&s;s; becau&s;e they wont put their Friends and Acquaintance out of Countenance.</P>
<P>Next Day Mr. <HI>Yea&s;t</HI> had <HI>Tom</HI> brought up before the Company, and in&s;i&s;ted on the Baronet's di&s;charging that Scoun|drel. <HI>I am no Scoundrel</HI> (interrupted <HI>Tom</HI>) <HI>God made me, as well as you, Sir.</HI> &mdash;Hu&s;h, <HI>Tom (replied his Patron)</HI> you talk like a Pre&s;byterian, Child. What
<PB N="56" REF="72">has my Servant done to you, Mr. <HI>Yea&s;t?</HI> &mdash;Now the Reader mu&s;t be informed, that Sir <HI>Ta&s;ty</HI> had been told the Truth by the Servants who picked Mr. <HI>Yea&s;t</HI> up; therefore the young Baronet made a Je&s;t of what Mr. <HI>Yea&s;t</HI> told him, of <HI>Tom</HI>'s throwing him down, and otherwi&s;e maletreating him; but Sir <HI>Ta&s;ty</HI> &s;mile|ing, made the proud Man very unea&s;y; and he told <HI>Tom</HI>'s Ma&s;ter, he thought it no laughing Matter, and in&s;i&s;ted upon Satisfaction.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Ta&s;ty</HI> was ju&s;t returned from his Travels; and we all know, if there is nothing el&s;e to be taught abroad, you are &s;ure of being tutored in Punctilios.</P>
<P>Punctilios are all in all aboard. The Baronet was hurt, to think any Man dare demand Satisfaction of him; he aro&s;e, and giving Mr. <HI>Yea&s;t</HI> the Look con|temptuous, cried out, <HI>You &s;hall have Sa|tisfaction; I'm not to be called upon twice for that&mdash;I have not made the Grand Tour for nothing, 'pon onner.</HI> Tom, <HI>fetch me down my Pi&s;tols.</HI></P>
<P>But at that Moment Mr. <HI>Yea&s;t</HI> caught Hold of <HI>Tom,</HI> and with much He&s;ita|tion, tho' very mildly, de&s;ired Mr. <HI>Fool</HI> to &s;tay; for (as he wi&s;ely ob&s;erved) <HI>What Occa&s;ion have your Ma&s;ter and I to murder one another in cold Blood?</HI> As he
<PB N="57" REF="73">&s;poke, his Knees trembled, cold Drops of Sweat &s;tood on his Face, his Lips turned livid, his clammy Tongue &s;tuck to his parched Palate; all fevered with Fear, he then addre&s;&s;ed Sir <HI>Ta&s;ty, If I have &s;aid any Thing, Sir</HI> Ta&s;ty, <HI>to offend you, I a&s;k your Pardon; I might be too ra&s;h&mdash;You may be too ra&s;h&mdash;Pi&s;tols? I don't fear dying, to be &s;ure; becau&s;e it is a Debt we mu&s;t all pay; but to &s;hoot one another, as if we were De&s;erters?</HI>&mdash;That is bad enough <HI>(replied a Gentleman)</HI> come, let's forget and forgive; come, <HI>Ta&s;ty,</HI> don't be queer now, &s;hake Hands with Orthodoxy, for once be reconciled to Religion.</P>
<P>The young Baronet bowed, &s;miled, and &s;tretched out his Hand. Mr. <HI>Yea&s;t</HI>'s met it amicably; the Daemon of Di&s;cord was drowned in a half-pint Bumper; and the choice Spirit, good Fellow&s;hip, again pre&s;ided over the Society.</P>

<P><HI>TOM Fool</HI> won his Match, and his Ma&s;ter took him Home in the Po&s;t Chariot. After they had gone a|bout ten Miles, the Baronet woke by a &s;udden Jolt, and rubbing his Eyes, a&s;ked <HI>Tom</HI> what he had been thinking about.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Fool.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Thinking, Sir?&mdash;Indeed, I had &s;ome very odd Thoughts come into my Head ju&s;t now. Pray, Sir, if you and Mr. <HI>Yea&s;t</HI> had killed one another, with Pi&s;tols Ye&s;terday, what Satisfaction would that have been to either of ye?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Ta&s;ty.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Satisfaction? No, <HI>Tom,</HI> you mi&s;take. Not according to the vulgar Meaning of the Word Satisfaction, I grant you; but you mu&s;t know, that every Thing has two Meanings, a Gentleman's Mean|ing, and a Mechanic's.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Ta&s;ty.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, <HI>Tom,</HI> as to that&mdash;It's Ta&s;te&mdash;and a Man of Honour, Family, and Fa&s;hion, is only to con&s;ider that.</P>

<P>Oh, as to that, <HI>Tom,</HI> I &s;hall always &s;peak plain to you.

<P>Undoubtedly, <HI>Tom,</HI> when 'tis for your Advantage, or for my Intere&s;t. But, <HI>Tom,</HI> there is a great Difference between &s;uch People as you, and me; for In|&s;tance now, &s;uppo&s;e you promi&s;e a Girl

<P>NIGHT is the Sabbath of human Kind; Midnight therefore is high Holiday.&mdash;Oft at this witching Time of Night, the Mind-tainted fair One ex|pects her dear Undoer.&mdash;Thus it was&mdash;We are &s;orry to &s;ay it;&mdash;But thus it was with Mi&s;s <HI>Fa&s;h.</HI>&mdash;She was in Bed&mdash;Li&s;|tening impatiently to each Beat of her Repeater.

<P>Her Chamber-door gently opening, &s;he rai&s;ed her Head, looking like <HI>Eve</HI> in the nuptal Bower, and &s;weetly whi&s;|pered, <HI>My dear Tom Fool, is it you?</HI></P>
<P>No, Madam, it is not <HI>Tom Fool,</HI> nor am I to be made a Fool of&mdash;<HI>a Voice im|mediately an&s;wered;</HI> and on the In&s;tant, her Brother, Sir <HI>Ta&s;ty,</HI> pre&s;ented him&s;elf before her. Shame, Grief, Anger, Fear, Pride, and Di&s;appointment prevented her Reply; pale, mute, and motionle&s;s &s;he lay, like the Effigy of Beauty in monu|mental Marble. Thus her Brother went
<PB N="62" REF="78">on. <HI>So it was</HI> Tom Fool <HI>you expected? I know it; he told me &s;o him&s;elf.</HI> She then gave a Shriek, which brought her Maid into the Bed-chamber; Mi&s;s bur&s;t|ing into Tears, begged her Brother to withdraw, till &s;he had put on her Night-cloaths. Sir <HI>Ta&s;ty</HI> obeyed, and by a Sign from the Maid, &s;ecreted him&s;elf in <HI>Betty</HI>'s Bed-room.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Fa&s;h</HI> huddling on her Cloaths in an Agony, which I hope no fair Lady may feel for the future, flew into her Mama's Apartment; and &s;obbing, beg|ged, for God's Sake, that <HI>Tom Fool</HI> might be turned away that very Mo|ment.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Grotto,</HI> the fonde&s;t of all Mo|thers, without a&s;king any more Que&s;|tions, gave an Order for <HI>Tom</HI>'s in&s;tant Di&s;charge, much to the Grief of all the other Servants; between one and two that Morning, <HI>Tom</HI> was turned out of Doors.&mdash;Poor Fellow, he never once complained. All he &s;aid, was, <HI>he thanked God, he had not done any Thing to de&s;erve &s;uch Treatment.</HI>&mdash;Then he walked into a Poddock, clo&s;e to the Garden, and as it was Moon&s;hine and warm Weather, he fini&s;hed his Nap under a new-made Hay|&s;tack.</P>
<PB N="63" REF="79">
<P>The Baronet unju&s;tly accu&s;ed <HI>Tom Fool;</HI> that young Fellow had not opened his Lips to any one Per&s;on con|cerning this A&s;&s;ignation; but Sir <HI>Ta&s;ty</HI> told her &s;o for the Joke's Sake, only to hum her a little.</P>

<P>We may therefore be certain, from his Manner of Rea&s;oning, he was not &s;u&s;picious of his Si&s;ter.&mdash;It was by mere Accident he that Night blundered into Mi&s;s <HI>Fa&s;h</HI>'s Apartment.</P>

<P>AT the Bottom of a new-made Stack, cut like an inverted Cone, with an Arm-full of Hay for his Pil|low, poor <HI>Tom</HI> lay &s;leeping; the mild beaming Moon brightening every Object around him.</P>
<P>The di&s;tant Steeples, Turrets, and Slate-topped Hou&s;es &s;eemed &s;ilvered&mdash;beneath the Hedges Gloom, the Glow|worms glimmered thro' the leafy Trees; the whi&s;pering Wind rocked the little Birds to Re&s;t, that were perched on the Velvet-budding Branches; the Dew|moi&s;tened Gra&s;s gli&s;tened, as if thick &s;own with Pearl; the bleating Ewes, and baaing Lambs lay by him; and, on an up-hill Land, at Di&s;tance, with Legs bent underneath them, chewing the Cud, the lowing Herds were re&s;ted; while mid&s;t the Reeds a ripling Rivulet &s;hin|ing, &s;lowly rolled over the Water-po|li&s;hed Pebbles; and the unclouded Arch of Heaven, &s;tudded with Stars, cano|pied the Land&s;kape.</P>
<P>Twilight &s;oon brought on Day; the Cock began to clap his Wings, kawing Rooks for&s;ook their Elms, the Face of Earth fre&s;h opened to the Sun.&mdash;<HI>But
<PB N="70" REF="86">what is all this De&s;cription for?</HI> (Thus intelligent Readers may cry out) But to &s;top all future Fault-finders, the Tran|&s;criber a&s;&s;ures them, it was wrote for,&mdash;for&mdash;for the Sake of De&s;cription.</P>
<P><HI>Tom Fool,</HI> awoke by the Birds, made the be&s;t of his Way to Town, to col|lect his Debts, and then re&s;olved to go to <HI>London,</HI> and look after his Relations; and find out the Rea&s;on why his Father di&s;inherited him.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Per&s;on <HI>Tom</HI> went to, was a Publican, to whom he had lent ten Pounds; had always twirled his Chafers there, and recommended him to Sir <HI>Ta&s;ty</HI> to have the Baronet's Cu&s;tom; and which, upon <HI>Tom</HI>'s &s;peaking, the Publican obtained.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not take upon me to de&s;cribe the &s;udden Change of Voice, Sentiment and Countenance, with which the Ale|&s;eller was marked, upon hearing of <HI>Tom</HI>'s Di&s;grace from his own Mouth. Every Per&s;on who meets with Misfortunes, is &s;ure of meeting with &s;uch Subjects.</P>
<P>Indeed, <HI>Tom (thus the Inn-keeper opened)</HI> you have done &s;ome very bad Thing at his Honour's, or el&s;e &s;uch good Folks, as the Gentry at the Hall are, would never have turned you away, at once &s;o, without a Character. For
<PB N="71" REF="87">my Part, I &s;hall be glad to &s;ee you, if you can make it up with his Honour, but not el&s;e; becau&s;e, if his Honour &s;hould know, I &s;hould harbour you, why, he might never put his Hor&s;es up here again.</P>
<P><HI>Tom</HI> looked a little &s;urprized, but was too much of a Fool to fly in a Pa&s;&s;ion. He a&s;ked the Publican, mildly, for the ten Pounds; the other denied he owed him any. Young <HI>Fool</HI> had been &s;o &s;illy, as not to take a Note for the Money; for he was &s;o very fooli&s;h, as to &s;uppo&s;e Mankind hone&s;t, through Principle; and was weak enough to believe, that tho&s;e School-boy Terms, Integrity, Gra|titude, Friend&s;hip, public Spirit, Libe|rality and Fidelity; (Words that he had often made Themes upon) were real Qualities, and inherent among the hu|man Species. With Indignation he left his abandoned Ho&s;t, and went to others, whom he had formerly obliged with ready Money, but never before a&s;ked them for it; for he thought, as indeed every Fool will, that Mankind, being influenced by the Examples of their Bet|ters, to behave as well as they can, con|&s;equently they would pay him as &s;oon as they were able.</P>
<PB N="72" REF="88">
<P>Yet not a &s;ingle Shilling could he get; it was all over with him; he was not now his Honour's, Sir <HI>Ta&s;ty</HI>'s, Favourite; no, he was only <HI>Tom Fool</HI> out of Place, &s;o what &s;ignified paying him, he could never lend them again, therefore they had better keep what they had got.&mdash;In this Manner, we &s;uppo&s;e, they rea&s;oned; for altho' we can't &s;ee &s;o far into every Man's Head, as <HI>De&s;cartes</HI> did, we have often attended Lectures upon the human Heart, and to our Sorrow, we declare, that the Generality of two-footed Exi&s;|tencies, vulgarly called Barons of the Creation, have very &s;eldom noble Blood, ebbing or flowing within any of their Ventricles.</P>
<P>The Reception <HI>Tom</HI> met with made him unea&s;y. The greate&s;t Ideot that ever was born, mu&s;t have been &s;hocked at &s;uch Behaviour, (By Ideots, I don't mean tho&s;e unhappy Objects, who&s;e de|fective Organs make them May-games to the &s;ounder-formed Part of the World. I mean, it would have &s;hocked that Society of Men, who are nick|named Ideots by their Wives, their Bro|thers, their Friends, their Partners, Ma|&s;ters, and kept Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es.)</P>
<P><HI>Tom</HI> &s;et him&s;elf upon a Bench in the new Walk, and there the Fool began to
<PB N="73" REF="89">cry; not that he was frightened at a Pro&s;pect of his own wretched Circum|&s;tances.&mdash;No; but &s;orry for the Villainy of Men; and a &s;elf Compari&s;on, to think how he had been cheated.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Bonville</HI> happened ju&s;t then to be walking in the &s;ame Place, ruminating upon the Adventure of Mi&s;s <HI>Fa&s;h,</HI> and young <HI>Fool;</HI> for Sir <HI>Ta&s;ty</HI> had breakfa&s;t|ed with her; and told her a long Story about his Si&s;ter's Weakne&s;s. When Mi&s;s <HI>Bonville</HI> came to the Bench where <HI>Tom</HI> &s;at, &s;he knew him at once; &s;he &s;eated her&s;elf by him, and &s;eeing him afflicted, very compa&s;&s;ionately took him by the Hand, told him, &s;he knew what ail'd him, and in&s;i&s;ted on his going Home with her.</P>
<P><HI>Tom</HI> could not at fir&s;t recollect her; for as Sir <HI>Ta&s;ty</HI>'s Family had &s;ent her &s;e|veral good Things, and the Baronet had fallen in Love with her, &s;he was very elegantly dre&s;&s;ed; when he found out who &s;he was, he was &s;o overjoyed to &s;ee &s;uch an Alteration in her for the better, that he forgot all his own Cro&s;&s;es, and went Home with her, with as much Joy, as if he had been the Baronet him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Bonville</HI> could not get a Syllable concerning Mi&s;s <HI>Fa&s;h</HI> out of <HI>Tom Fool,</HI>
<PB N="74" REF="90">until &s;he told him, that Sir <HI>Ta&s;ty,</HI> no longer ago than that Morning, &s;wore to her, that he caught <HI>Tom</HI> and his Si&s;ter in Bed together. <HI>No, indeed, Ma|dam,</HI> (<HI>Tom</HI> cried out, eagerly interrupt|ing her) <HI>no, Madam, as I hope for Salva|tion, I had never an Intimacy with Mi&s;s</HI> Fa&s;h; <HI>indeed, I never had&mdash;I love her dearly&mdash;dearly, indeed, I love her; but it is a Love of E&s;teem, of Re&s;pect, I wi&s;h her happy, I would die to make her &s;o.</HI></P>
<P>Either the Manner in which <HI>Tom</HI> &s;poke this, or a grateful Remembrance of <HI>Tom</HI>'s former good Nature; that Moment upon Mi&s;s <HI>Bonville,</HI> a &s;udden Thrill &s;hot thro' her Bo&s;om, her Eyes &s;wam with Tender|ne&s;s; &s;he &s;eized young <HI>Fool</HI>'s Hand, and in a Tone, which is properly the Food of Love; &s;he murmured, O <HI>Tom Fool,</HI> you may make any Women happy.</P>
<P><HI>Tom,</HI> tho' a Fool, was not in&s;en&s;ible; he was gently giving Way to the agree|able Pre&s;&s;ure; but recollecting that he ought to clear up Mi&s;s <HI>Fa&s;h</HI>'s Reputation, he ki&s;&s;ed Mi&s;s <HI>Bonville</HI>'s Hand, and begged her Permi&s;&s;ion to relate the Affair with Sir <HI>Ta&s;ty</HI>'s Si&s;ter, as it really happened; Mi&s;s told him, &s;he &s;hould be glad to hear it; upon which <HI>Tom</HI> imme|diately related what, if the Reader plea&s;es, he may read in the next Chapter.</P>

<P>MAdam, my Father was a Baronet, whom, indeed, I have never &s;een &s;ince I went to School; he died about three years ago, and for what Rea&s;on, I know not, cut me off with a Shilling.

<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I believe Mi&s;s <HI>Fa&s;h</HI> had a Sort of Friend&s;hip for me; and her Manner of Behaviour to me, when &s;he took me to walk out with her, made me wi&s;h my&s;elf to be in proper Circum|&s;tances, that I dared to have taken No|tice of it.&mdash;But, as I was&mdash;I knew it would be ba&s;e in me, to &s;eem to under|&s;tand her&mdash;For I love her, Madam&mdash;And could I entice her to do any Thing beneath her Rank, which &s;he mu&s;t have done, had &s;he carried on a Corre&s;pon|dence with her Brother's Servant.</P>

<P>Oh, how did &s;he lament her Misfor|tune, and cur&s;e the Tediou&s;ne&s;s of Law|yers; for, as &s;he ob&s;erved, had I been but in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my two Hundred a Year, then I &s;hould not have been in &s;uch Awe and Fear of this Fop <HI>Ta&s;ty,</HI> nor been forced to have hurried away that fine &s;pirited Fellow, <HI>Tom Fool,</HI> like a Thief.

<P>THE News of <HI>Tom</HI>'s Di&s;grace quick|ly was &s;pread over the Town; but when the Women came to be certain he might have had Mi&s;s <HI>Fa&s;h,</HI> if he would, and that it was only his Fault, that &s;he was not ruined; they mobbed him, and hi&s;s'd him, called him <HI>Molly</HI>&mdash;Nay, we don't know what Lengths they might have proceeded, had not my Lady <HI>Grott</HI>'s Po&s;t Chariot broke through the Throng, and &s;omebody in it called up|on <HI>Tom Fool;</HI> it was my Lady's Wo|man, who came to Town on Purpo&s;e to find him.</P>
<P>She had longed, wi&s;hed, to have &s;ome &s;ecret Conver&s;ation with young <HI>Fool;</HI> but knowing Mi&s;s <HI>Fa&s;h</HI>'s Inclinations were al&s;o bent that Way, as <HI>Mark An|thony</HI> did, when <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> kept <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> &s;he could only &s;igh in &s;ecret.</P>
<P>But as &s;oon as the News of <HI>Tom's</HI> Di&s;mi&s;|&s;ion reached her, &s;he borrowed the Chariot, re&s;olving to find him out; which &s;he did very critically, re&s;cuing him out of the Hands of an irritated Mob, and conveyed him to the <HI>George.</HI>&mdash;She ordered the Hor&s;es to be put up, enquired of <HI>Tom</HI> what he would eat, be&s;poke a broiled
<PB N="83" REF="99">Fowl and Mu&s;hroom, bid the Po&s;til|lion get &s;ome Ale, ordered a Bottle of <HI>Madeira;</HI> and then &s;at her&s;elf down, panting for Want of Breath; lamenting how &s;tupid Servants were in Public-Hou&s;es, that they mu&s;t be told &s;o many Times what they &s;hould bring.</P>
<P>Then, directing her&s;elf to young <HI>Fool,</HI> &s;he a&s;ked him, if he was not in a great Quandary, now he had lo&s;t his Place, and was without a Character.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Tom.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P><HI>No, Madam, I &s;hall now make the be&s;t of my Way to</HI> London, <HI>and &s;ee after my Relations.</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs. Flimms.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That will be very dutifully done, in|deed, Mr. <HI>Thomas;</HI> but I'll tell you what, Child, I would not have you go to <HI>London,</HI> as yet, becau&s;e, as why &mdash; I in|tend going up to <HI>London</HI> my&s;elf, &s;hortly, and we'll go together.</P>
<P><HI>Tom</HI> bowed, and thanked her&mdash;<HI>when &s;he thus went on</HI>&mdash;Till I go to <HI>London,</HI> Mr. <HI>Fool,</HI> I would have you go and &s;tay with my Brother; he is Butler to Mr. <HI>Invoyce,</HI> the rich Merchant. I'll give you a Letter To-day, and you &s;hall &s;et off with it in the Morning. I won't be many Weeks after you, for I &s;corn to
<PB N="84" REF="100">&s;tay in a Family where they have u&s;ed you &s;o ill.</P>
<P>Young <HI>Fool</HI> hoped, he told her, &s;he would not lo&s;e &s;o good a Place, as La|dy <HI>Grott</HI>'s, upon his Account.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs. Flimms.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Don't you mind that,</HI> Tom, <HI>nor don't be ca&s;t down.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Fool.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am not ca&s;t down, Madam, I have done no Harm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs. Flimms.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, <HI>Tom,</HI> but it's more out of your Goodne&s;s, than our Mi&s;s's Mo|de&s;ty.&mdash;Mi&s;s&mdash;yes, yes, &s;he'll be any Body's Mi&s;s &s;hortly&mdash;a pretty Piece of Work, truly, to turn a poor Lad out of Doors at Midnight.&mdash;Well, thank God, I don't value Service of a Row of Pins. If I a'nt &s;o hand&s;ome as Mi&s;s <HI>Fa&s;h,</HI> what then, I am a more hone&s;ter Woman; and if you like me, <HI>Tom,</HI> as well as I like you, why, when I come away from my Place, I'll make you my Hu&s;band.</P>
<P><HI>Tom</HI> replied, he was very much oblig|ed to her, to be &s;ure; and that it was great Good-nature in her, to take &s;o much Notice of him, and that he would never forget it, but &s;erve her by Night and by Day. The Reply plea&s;ed Mrs. <HI>Flimms,</HI> &s;he wrote him the Letter imme|diately; and as &s;he gave it him, he
<PB N="85" REF="101">thanked her, and very gallantly ki&s;&s;ed her Hand; this &s;he returned, by &s;alut|ing his Lips, and pre&s;&s;ing him clo&s;e to her; her Arms about his Wai&s;t, her Eyes&mdash;But the abrupt Entrance of young <HI>Blood,</HI> prevented any farther Pro|ceedings on either Side.</P>
<P>Young <HI>Blood</HI> was a Neighbour of Sir <HI>Ta&s;ty</HI>'s, and an Admirer of Mi&s;s <HI>Fa&s;h</HI>&mdash;not with an Intent to marry her&mdash;but ju&s;t to have an Affair with her; or at lea&s;t, to be &s;o intimate in the Family, that it might &s;eem as if he had. For this Rea|&s;on, her Brother and he were as great as two Gamblers. He had heard of <HI>Tom</HI>'s Ca&s;e, and being told by the Drawer, that he was in the Hou&s;e along with Lady Dowager's Woman, he opened the Door upon them (true Politene&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in Freedom) called for a clean Gla&s;s, &s;at him&s;elf down, a&s;ked Mrs. <HI>Flimms</HI> how &s;he did; and then thus addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to <HI>Tom.</HI></P>

<P>So, my Lad, What's all this Hub|bub about you and <HI>Bett Fa&s;h?</HI> If you did get to Bed to her, &s;o much the bet|ter; I honour you for it, you are a Fel|low of Spirit.</P>

<P>Don't deny it, neither, <HI>Tom,</HI>&mdash;don't hum us&mdash;for if a Man an't a&s;hamed of lying with a Woman, Why &s;hould he be a&s;hamed of telling it?</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Flimms</HI> here interrupted, a&s;&s;uring the Squire, that upon her Honour, it was no &s;uch Thing. Tom Fool <HI>is a likely Fellow to be &s;ure, and the be&s;t Lady in the Land, for that Matter, might like him&mdash;&s;he ob&s;erved.</HI></P>

<P>No, indeed, Sir, my Duty, my Con|&s;cience, my Religion forbid me.</P>

<P>You ha'nt your Name for nothing. You are <HI>Tom Fool,</HI> indeed.&mdash;Your Reli|gion forbids you?&mdash;What the Devil Re|ligion are you of?&mdash;A Papi&s;t?&mdash;For I am &s;ure, our Par&s;ons don't forbid us getting to Bed to a pretty Girl, they do it them&s;elves.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Tom Fool.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir, may I be &s;o bold to a&s;k your Opinion of Honour?&mdash;Don't take it ill, Sir&mdash;I only do it for Information Sake&mdash;Pray, Sir, in what does Honour con&s;i&s;t?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Blood.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, in every Thing&mdash;But, pray, do you mean a Gentleman's Honour, or a Lady's?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Tom Fool.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I thought they had been the &s;ame, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Blood.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, damned different; for now, in the fir&s;t Place, a Man of Honour mu&s;t never give up any Thing.&mdash;Now, as to a Lady, &s;he, you know, may do as &s;he plea&s;es; and then a Man of Ho|nour mu&s;t be quite the Thing too.&mdash; Now the Lady's Honour is another
<PB N="88" REF="104">Thing.&mdash;Becau&s;e, if &s;uppo&s;ing you was to be a Man of Honour, as well as me, why, then if I'am affronted, or &s;uppo&s;ing that any Lady &s;hould let a&mdash;In &s;hort, a Man of Honour is every Thing, and he who is not a Man of Honour, is no|thing at all, and not worth keeping Company with.&mdash;So here's to you&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<P>During this Argument, Mrs. <HI>Flimms</HI> had been very attentive, as to the Man|ner, more than the Matter of it. <HI>Tom Fool</HI>'s pa&s;&s;ive Deportment, his downca&s;t Look, mild Tone of Voice, and calm Face, made her think he was not well.</P>
<P>But Squire <HI>Blood</HI>'s Vociferation, clench|ing his Fi&s;t, hitting it again&s;t the Wain|&s;cot, and firmly &s;tamping acro&s;s the Room, gave an Alarm to her Sen&s;ibi|lities. The many Bumpers &s;he had drank a&s;&s;i&s;ting her Ideas, &s;he &s;ighed, &s;he wi&s;hed, &s;he longed; nay, &s;he, re&s;olved to have a <HI>tete a tete</HI> Conver&s;ation with the Squire; not that &s;he intended to di&s;|card <HI>Tom;</HI> but, ju&s;t as other Ladies have done before her, &s;he fancied the Gen|tleman. &mdash;Therefore looking at her Watch, &s;he de&s;ired Mr. <HI>Fool</HI> to have the Chai&s;e grea&s;ed, and begged he'd &s;tand by, and &s;ee it done, and have the Hor&s;es put too. As &s;oon as <HI>Tom</HI> left the Room, &s;he turned to young <HI>Blood,</HI> &s;impering,
<PB N="89" REF="105">and li&s;ped out, I wonder how you could talk &s;o wickedly to <HI>Tom,</HI> Sir, about get|ting to Bed to a Woman?&mdash;Dear Heart, you are enough to corrupt a Saint; in|deed, I &s;hould be afraid to be tru&s;ted long alone with you.</P>
<P><HI>Blood,</HI> to whom all Women were alike (as a Man in a Fever never ta&s;tes the Liquor he &s;wallows) &s;eized Mrs. <HI>Flimms</HI> by the Wri&s;t, and gave her three or four Ki&s;&s;es out of Fun, which &s;he took by way of Frolic.&mdash;But, &s;ure, her unlucky Planet ruled that Day, for <HI>Tom</HI>'s Re|turn broke off all farther Parley.</P>
<P>Young <HI>Fool</HI> informed Mrs. <HI>Flimms,</HI> that <HI>Ned,</HI> the Whipper-in, was come from the Hall, for her to go Home im|mediately; and that the O&s;tler had al|ready grea&s;ed the Wheels, and the Hor&s;es were put to.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t all learn to bear Misfor|tunes.&mdash;She replied, <HI>Servants had better be Slaves; but, thank God, it would not be long &s;o.</HI> She charged <HI>Tom</HI> to &s;et off with the Letter directly; then &s;eated her|&s;elf in the Chariot, and leaning out of the Window, told Squire <HI>Blood,</HI> if he had a Mind to hear how Things went at their Hou&s;e, there was Room by her; but he, like all other very impudent Fel|lows, who are always ba&s;hful out of
<PB N="90" REF="106">Sea&s;on, declined the Proffer;&mdash;Thanked her, but &s;aid, he mu&s;t wait for a Friend, made his Bow, and retreated into the Parlour. Mrs. <HI>Flimms</HI> nodded not in Return, but pulled up the Gla&s;s, and &s;ullenly threw her&s;elf back, bidding the Boy go on to the Hall, where we'll &s;et her down, and ju&s;t &s;ee her &s;afe into the Cordial Clo&s;et, and there leave her, con|&s;oling her&s;elf with the never-failing No&s;|trum for all Di&s;appointments.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII.</HEAD>
<P>EXcu&s;e me, Reader, if I don't parti|culari&s;e the Method in which young <HI>Fool</HI> travelled; for in Writing, as in Painting, &s;ome Things are to be left to the Conoi&s;&s;eur's Imagination. After a little Enquiry, our Hero arrived at the Gentleman's, to whom Mrs. <HI>Flimms</HI>'s Brother was Butler.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Ephraim Invoyce</HI> was born upon <HI>Dowgate hill, An. Dom.</HI> 1698; his Fa|ther was a wealthy Corn-chandler; young <HI>Ephraim</HI> married again&s;t his Pa|rents Con&s;ent, and had only a hundred Pounds left him at the old Man's De|cea&s;e, which happened &s;oon after.</P>
<P>With this Money, the fond Couple kept a Cyder-cellar; and Mrs. <HI>Invoyce</HI> being a very fine Figure, had many Ad|mirers. She, as well as her Hu&s;band, had di&s;obliged her Relations by her ha&s;ty Wedding &mdash; But Love, to them, was before all the Riches in the World.&mdash; This they often declared.&mdash;However, Mr. <HI>Invoyce</HI> had not been a Hu&s;band a|bove a Year, before he began to reflect upon the Folly of Love and Honour; and finding there was nothing like turn|ing the Penny, he determined, &s;ince
<PB N="92" REF="108">his Wife had lo&s;t him one Fortune, &s;he &s;hould get him another; &s;he was now in her Bloom, and every Body prai&s;ed her.</P>
<P>He &s;oon made her &s;en&s;ible, how much it was for both their Intere&s;ts, that &s;he &s;hould give &s;ome of her Lovers En|couragement, and that it was proper to make Men pay for their Court&s;hip; and that &s;he would not be the wor&s;e, and as how their Betters did it.</P>
<P>The Duty of a Wife is to obey; Mrs. <HI>Invoyce</HI> became very dutiful; her Spou&s;e increa&s;ed in Wealth, he &s;at up a Tavern, caught her in Bed with a rich <HI>Jew,</HI> by Agreement; recovered &s;wingeing Da|mages, left off the Wintner's Bu&s;ine&s;s, and turned Wine-merchant.</P>
<P>His Lady dying, he married the Wi|dow <HI>Eld,</HI> from <HI>Paul</HI>'s Wharf; &s;he died of a Surfeit, in about a Month after Con&s;ummation, and left him all her For|tune, which was upwards of 20,000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>Madam <HI>Lyme,</HI> the <HI>We&s;t Indian</HI> Relict, he made his Addre&s;&s;es to. She was im|men&s;ely rich, and con&s;ented to give him her Hand; but they had not been wed above two Years, before he was again left a di&s;con&s;olate Widower; his Lady having been overturned in the Chariot, as &s;he was going to <HI>Billing&s;gate</HI> to buy &s;ome Fi&s;h for an Entertainment they
<PB N="93" REF="109">were to have the next Day. Her Enemies &s;ay, that &s;he was &s;omewhat intoxicated before &s;he fell; but be that as it may be, &s;he never &s;poke after they picked her up. But to do Mr. <HI>Invoyce</HI> Ju&s;tice, he cau&s;ed her to lie in State, and buried her with all imaginable Splendor.</P>
<P>By Trade and Matrimony <HI>Ephraim</HI> had ama&s;&s;ed a va&s;t Sum of Money; he therefore re&s;olved to retire from Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and live genteel for the Remain|der of his Life; and as he was now re&s;olved not to marry for Money, but for Honour; he took to him&s;elf Lady <HI>Title</HI>'s Daughter, a beautiful young Lady, with all the Accompli&s;h|ments to render the married State hap|py. She was the mo&s;t notable Creature exi&s;ting, either at bidding in an Auction Room, or doing the Duties of her own Card Table; and then, &s;uch a Memory. &mdash;She had all <HI>Hoyle</HI> by Heart.&mdash;She was pa&s;&s;ionately fond of Mu&s;ic, and would not mi&s;s a Concert for the Uni|ver&s;e; add to all this, &s;he had travelled, and might ju&s;tly be called an improved Lady. She &s;oon brought Mr. <HI>Invoyce</HI> in|to her Way of Thinking, and he entered into the very Spirit of Improvement.</P>
<P>When <HI>Tom</HI> arrived there, every Thing around &s;eemed to be marked for
<PB N="94" REF="110">improving, or had been improved. Mr. <HI>Invoyce,</HI> to &s;ave Charges, had bought a Gentleman's Hou&s;e, which he new-fronted with a va&s;t Heap of Stones piled upon one another, with &s;everal Air Holes at regular Di&s;tances; the Building indenting, and then bulging, as if the Plan of it had been &s;ketched from the irriguous Windings of the Snake in <HI>Orpheus.</HI> To this was given the Name of <HI>New Hall;</HI> it was notched all along the Top by way of Battlements; then it was buttriced, and as properly turreted with &s;everal pyramidical and &s;everal cylindrical Ornaments; which made it a compleat Thing, and might be &s;een a great Way off.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Runic</HI> was the Architect.</P>
<P>Each End of this was bricked up to the Battlements, and that Brick-work was balu&s;trated and pila&s;tered, and <HI>Ve|netian</HI> windowed. Full South (or what was called the Garden Front) this ele|gant Structure &s;hone to the Sun, all plai&s;tered and painted, partly in the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and partly in the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Man|ner; SAN CONTOUR did the Bru&s;h|work.</P>
<P>The Gardens, Canals, Grottos, Ca|taracts, Ha-has, Hermitages, Serpen|tines, Temples and Pagodas, were laid
<PB N="95" REF="111">out by Mynheer <HI>Zigg Zagg,</HI> principal De&s;igner, whom Sir <HI>Ta&s;ty</HI>'s Father had formerly brought over from <HI>Switzerland.</HI> He was recommended by Lady <HI>Grotto,</HI> on the earne&s;t Reque&s;t of Lady <HI>Title,</HI> that Mr. <HI>Invoyce</HI> might have a right Notion of Things; and that the Gar|dens might be made Places fit for Peo|ple of Fa&s;hion to put their Feet in.</P>
<P>But altho' Mr. <HI>Invoyce</HI>'s Lady had an E&s;teem for Mr. <HI>Zigg Zagg</HI>'s Ta&s;te and Genius, yet, as &s;he had travelled her|&s;elf, &s;he in&s;i&s;ted now and then upon hav|ing a Hint of her own executed; and ju&s;t as <HI>Tom Fool</HI> came up to the De&s;igner to &s;alute him (for they were Acquaint|ance) the <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> had received a puzzling Order from my Lady, for &s;he would have twelve new <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Bridges gone about, from De&s;igns that &s;he had copied from Fan-mounts.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Zigg Zagg</HI> was at a Lo&s;s where to put them; he had already cut up a fine Piece of Meadow Ground, to make a crooked Trench, which they called a Serpentine River; but that Piece of Water was to have two Pagodas, a Man|darin Barge, and three floating I&s;lands in it. He concluded to dig a Ditch for them, where the Wall-fruit grew; for it
<PB N="96" REF="112">was the Ta&s;te at pre&s;ent to have every Thing forced; therefore tho&s;e Trees were u&s;ele&s;s; from the &s;ame Principle, the Brewery was turned into a Hot-bed for Pines; and the Cherry Orchard and Kitch|en Garden into a Lake for a <HI>Venetian</HI> Gondola.</P>
<P>When <HI>Tom Fool</HI> came among&s;t all the&s;e Preparations, he could not make half of them out&mdash;But as he was a Fool, it's not to be wondered at. Yet I mu&s;t &s;peak &s;o much in Favour of <HI>Tom</HI>'s Un|der&s;tanding, that it would have puzzled a Man of Sen&s;e, if he had not a quite right Notion of Things, to tell what the People at this Place were doing.</P>
<P>Piled like Stacks of Billet-wood were Heaps of Tree Roots, grubbed up to make Hermitages. Near them were &s;e|veral Waggon Loads of <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Railings, and Pali&s;adoes for Temples, Pig&s;ties, Chicken-coops, Triumphal Arches and Dog-kennels; Gryphons, Unicorns, Mer|maids, &s;kaiting <HI>Dutchmen,</HI> dancing Sai|lors and piping Satyrs lay in Ranks, rea|dy to be put up where they could find Room for them.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Zigg Zagg</HI> was &s;haking <HI>Tom</HI> by the Hand, when a Me&s;&s;age came to him from my Lady; who was then with her Hu&s;band in a Di&s;pute, which Mr. <HI>Invoyce</HI>
<PB N="97" REF="113">at la&s;t was forced to give up. The Ca&s;e was this. When her Lady&s;hip's Spou&s;e, hone&s;t <HI>Ephraim,</HI> as he was called in the City, fir&s;t got this Hou&s;e, he decorated with <HI>Stucco,</HI> and mock <HI>India</HI> Paper, the large&s;t Room in it; and which had formerly been a Library-place; there|fore he de&s;igned it for the &s;ame U&s;e again, and had long ago &s;ent Dimen&s;ions of the Shelves to his Book&s;eller in <HI>Lon|don,</HI> to furni&s;h it accordingly; but when the Books arrived, and my Lady was called in to give her Opinion concerning the placing of the Volumes, &s;he began to like the Room &s;o well, now it was fini&s;hed, that &s;he told her Spou&s;e, it would be &s;tupid to employ &s;o pretty a Room as that was now, to &s;uch an out-o-the-way Purpo&s;e, as to put Books in it.&mdash;Books!&mdash;I &s;hall die, my Dear&mdash;Mr. <HI>Invoyce,</HI> it's horridly provoking in you, to think of &s;uch a Thing; pray, let all this learned Lumber be put in the haunt|ed Garret, the Book-ca&s;es you may make Cock-pens of; but, as to the Room, po&s;itively, I &s;hall &s;eize on that, to keep my A&s;&s;emblies in; and accord|ingly ordered Mr. <HI>Zigg Zagg</HI> to attend her immediately, to help her to orna|ment it.</P>
<PB N="98" REF="114">
<P>It was this Me&s;&s;age made him leave Mr. <HI>Fool</HI> &s;omewhat abruptly; and as Mr. <HI>Zigg Zagg</HI> knew the Butler was out, he de&s;ired <HI>Tom</HI> ju&s;t to &s;tep acro&s;s a Couple of Clo&s;es to the Sexton's Hou&s;e, and agree with him for five Cart Loads of Ivy, to fringe &s;ome Pieces of Walls; the Re|mains of three Farm Hou&s;es, that my Lady had pull'd down, to make a rui|nous Pro&s;pect, and al&s;o begg'd Mr. <HI>Fool</HI> to look about for &s;ome broken Pieces of Tomb-&s;tones, that were pretty much Mo&s;s-grown, becau&s;e he wanted them to face a Piece of new Antiquity. <HI>Tom</HI> left the Letter of Mrs. <HI>Flimms</HI> with Mr. <HI>Zigg Zagg,</HI> and her Brother coming Home, before <HI>Tom</HI> returned, the Epi&s;tle was given to him, the Contents of which were as follows.</P>

But it is the Fortune of many a young Gentleman in <HI>London,</HI> to be &s;poil'd by keeping low-lift Company, So he was, for he got among a Parcel of your queer ones, and they made him read outlandi&s;h Books, till he &s;tudied &s;o much, that they crack'd his Brains, &s;o he gave
<PB N="106" REF="122">away his Hounds, &s;old off his Town|hou&s;e, turn'd away a fine Girl he kept, as hone&s;t a Wench &s;he was as ever Man went to bed to; and he grew quite &s;tu|pid, liv'd entirely in the Country, and never went a &s;porting, but his Hou&s;e was crowded with this Mr. <HI>Threadbare,</HI> and that Mr. <HI>Ragged,</HI> and this was a Genos, and that was a one thing, and t'other another, all as poor as Dog-hor&s;es&mdash;the Devil a clever Fellow was there a|mong them all, but a one-ey'd Captain, and he, and our Par&s;on, u&s;ed to play at Back-Gammon together; &s;o when the old Soldier won, he u&s;ed to tip me a Twelver; but I got not a Grigg from the re&s;t; and the&s;e Fellows I was to &s;ad|dle my Ma&s;ter's Hor&s;es for,&mdash;no,&mdash;but I wou'd'nt tho'.</P>

<P><HI>TOM Fool,</HI> by his A&s;&s;iduity, his Ge|nero&s;ity, his Readine&s;s to do every Servant a good Turn, and excu&s;e any Mi&s;take they might have commited; the Mildne&s;s of his Deportment, his Quickne&s;s of Apprehen&s;ion, Alertne&s;s, and Obedience, gain'd him a general E&s;teem throughout the Family. Mr. <HI>Invoyce</HI>'s elde&s;t Daughter, declared him to be the genteele&s;t, handye&s;t, neate&s;t, Creature, &s;he ever knew.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Invoyce</HI>'s Lady prote&s;ted &s;he thought him too good for a Livery. His &s;econd Daughter, who, never before <HI>Tom</HI>'s coming into the Family, cou'd bear to take any thing out of a Man's Hand, vowed he was a charming Animal; and this was a great Thing for her to &s;ay, who&s;e whole Life was &s;pent among &s;hock Dogs, Squirrels, Monkeys, Parrots, Tabby Cats, and Guinea Pigs. The younge&s;t Si&s;ter al&s;o, who, before he came, u&s;ed to ride &s;traddling upon bare|back'd Hor&s;es, &s;pla&s;h about in the Boats, and had a fine Foot for Hop&s;cotch, now began to bear a Cap on, left off Hollow|ing, and made a Curt&s;y when &s;he came into the Dining-Room. And one Day
<PB N="108" REF="124">&s;he a&s;k'd her Papa, <HI>how Tom Fool (&s;o good a Servant as he was) came to leave his la&s;t Place.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Invoyce</HI> ob&s;erved, that was true, he never heard how it came about; but order'd the Butler to meet him imme|diately in the Lapland Summer-hou&s;e; and there he enquired, how <HI>Tom</HI> came to leave Sir <HI>Ta&s;ty</HI>'s.</P>
<P>The Butler, in the Warmth of his Heart, and as he thought to recommend <HI>Tom,</HI> gave his Ma&s;ter the Letter his Si&s;ter had wrote to him. This Letter Mr. <HI>In|voyce</HI> read at Dinner, highly prai&s;ing <HI>Tom</HI>'s Mode&s;ty; but in that he was not &s;econded. The Ladies all took again&s;t him, they wou'd not believe it, they &s;aid; as to Mi&s;s <HI>Fa&s;h</HI>'s liking <HI>Tom,</HI> her Lady|&s;hip ob&s;erv'd it was not unlikely; but as to his refu&s;ing her, Oh, my God! I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t on that to be fal&s;e: <HI>And &s;o &s;ay I, Papa,</HI> and &s;o &s;aid all. Ju&s;t then a vi&s;iting Lady arriv'd; who was no &s;ooner &s;eated, than &s;he confirm'd the Contents of the Letter. Ob&s;erving, at the &s;ame Time, &s;he was va&s;tly &s;urprized, they had not heard of it before. But my Lady made An&s;wer, they were &s;o taken up with Improvements, that they had not Time to enquire after News.&mdash;But as to <HI>Tom Fool</HI>'s Affair, it was &s;ome|thing
<PB N="109" REF="125">thing &s;o out of the way,&mdash;pon onner, I &s;hall never think &s;o well of the Fellow as I have done.&mdash;<HI>Think, Mama, I can't bear the Sight of him,</HI> (reply'd his young Lady) the Prude wonder'd what Men were made of. And Mi&s;s <HI>Hop&s;cotch</HI> threat|ned to tear his Eyes out.&mdash;The Vi&s;itant declared he was but a Fool.&mdash;That they granted; but yet they ob&s;erved, he ought to have kept the Thing &s;ecret.&mdash;Secret he &s;hould have kept it.&mdash;Clamour began to rai&s;e her Voice; and for all that Mr. <HI>Invoyce</HI> cou'd alledge in his Behalf, the Ladies in&s;i&s;ted on <HI>Tom Fool</HI>'s being di&s;charged that Evening.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as this Re&s;olution was told him, he left the Hall with Indignation; and &s;et forward for <HI>London</HI> immediately, without informing any Per&s;on of the Rout he intended to take. It was by this Hurry, that the vi&s;iting Lady lo&s;t him, who&s;e &s;ole Errand indeed was upon his Account.&mdash;For Mi&s;s <HI>Fa&s;h.</HI>&mdash;But let me not anticipate the Reader's Curio&s;ity; it's time enough to &s;peak about that young.

<P>Mr. <HI>Murphy Magragh,</HI> from the Queen's County, &s;ix Feet and one Inch high, of thirty-four Years of Age, hear|ing of the great Fortune Mi&s;s <HI>Fa&s;h</HI> wou'd be, came Po&s;t down, a few Days after <HI>Tom</HI>'s Bani&s;hment, to offer her his Hand, as a Gentleman ought, in lawful Wedlock.</P>
<P>But determined, fir&s;t to make him&s;elf acquainted with the upper Servants; by which Means, as he very wi&s;ely judged, he &s;hou'd &s;oon know as much about the young Lady, as the be&s;t of them.</P>
<P>By the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Landlady at the <HI>George,</HI> he din'd in a Day, or two, with Mrs. <HI>Flimms;</HI> and as he was a Man, who, in open Day-light cou'd &s;ee as far as another, he &s;oon perceiv'd &s;he lov'd to take a drink; the whole After|noon he dedicated his Attendance upon her. At la&s;t a lucky Thought came in|to his Head, which was, that if he cou'd make her &s;en&s;ible, what &s;ort of a Man him&s;elf was, &s;he might tell it her Mi&s;|tre&s;s; and then&mdash;O let him alone for Scheming&mdash;He redoubled his Attacks, &s;ung her &s;everal Songs, gave her &s;everal Ki&s;&s;es; and before the Fays, and Fairies, left their Gra&s;s-green Circle, &s;he yeild|ed&mdash;unable
<PB N="111" REF="127">to bear the Weight of two &s;uch potent Oppo&s;itions&mdash;De&s;ire, and Drink.&mdash;She yeilded&mdash;All that Hu&s;bands hold dear, all that the mighty make a Bu&s;tle about,&mdash;the Boa&s;t of the Proud;&mdash;the poor man's precious Property.</P>
<P><HI>Some Men have &s;uch a way with them</HI>&mdash;Mr. <HI>Macgragh</HI> was one of tho&s;e Sort of Men, as Mrs. <HI>Flimms</HI> confe&s;&s;ed, after every Thing was over.&mdash;As he was cer|tain he had fix'd her his Friend;&mdash;Poli|tician like, he opened his whole De&s;ign to her; told her, he came down ju&s;t to make a Match on't, betwixt him&s;elf and the young Lady, or the old Lady; for he wou'd'nt &s;tand upon Trifles about that at all, at all.</P>
<P>But Mrs. <HI>Flimms,</HI> &s;omething more &s;ly, than her Paramour (like a cunning Law|yer, not being willing to lo&s;e a good Client) told him, that Lady <HI>Grotto</HI> lo&s;t her Jointure the Day of her &s;econd Marriage. <HI>I'm off then,</HI> reply'd Mr. <HI>Macgragh.</HI>&mdash;And as to Mi&s;s&mdash;Mrs. <HI>Flimms</HI> declared, upon her Honour, &s;he was uncommattable; for my dear Mr. <HI>Macgraw,</HI> all her Dependance is upon her Brother Sir <HI>Ta&s;ty</HI>'s Good-will.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Flimms,</HI> after this Information, gave him &s;ome Hints of her own Con&s;e|quence, in re&s;pect to Wealth; and this

<P>Ju&s;t at &s;un-ri&s;ing, he enter'd upon <HI>Houn&s;low-heath;</HI> where, but the Even|ing before, a Highwayman had robb'd a Collector of the Exci&s;e; but the Thief being clo&s;ely pur&s;u'd, (at the Clo&s;e of the Day) dropp'd a 100 Pound Bag, and made his E&s;cape. This lay there unper|ceived; and as <HI>Tom</HI> was travelling, be|ing the earlie&s;t Pa&s;&s;enger, he &s;et his Foot upon it.</P>
<P>After he had opened it, he was un|determined what to do with it.

<PB N="115" REF="131">
<P>But prudent as his Re&s;olution was, he failed in it. Goading Nece&s;&s;ity arre&s;ted him; fa&s;ting, walking, and very faint, he took a &s;ingle Guinea out of the Bag, to get him&s;elf &s;ome Refre&s;hment; but re&s;olv'd to re&s;tore it, as &s;oon as ever he found his Relations.</P>

<P><HI>Jack Nankeen</HI> &s;aid, he ought to have brought him into the City.&mdash;<HI>Bob Long-&s;tick</HI> &s;wore, he &s;hou'd have carried him into <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall.</HI>&mdash;Or Suppo&s;e, &s;ays <HI>Tom Ta&s;&s;ell,</HI> the Author had &s;ent him to College.&mdash;Thus did the Gentlemen ani|madvert upon the Manu&s;cript.&mdash;After they had all given their Opinions, the Per&s;on who had been reading, with a very di&s;tinct Pronunciation, went on with the Hi&s;tory as follows.</P>
<P>Young <HI>Fool</HI> happened in the <HI>Mall</HI> to be behind two Men, who were very earne&s;t in their Talk, and he cou'd not help hearing one &s;ay to the other.&mdash;<HI>I am a Fool, I own it; yes, yes, I do belong to that Family.

<PB N="120" REF="136">
<P>They were come to the End of the <HI>Mall;</HI> and, after making an Apology for his Abruptne&s;s, <HI>Tom</HI> begg'd to &s;peak a Word with the Gentleman in the Bra&s;s|button'd Coat. Young <HI>Fool</HI> told him, that by his Di&s;cour&s;e, he over-heard, he was in Di&s;tre&s;s. I beg therefore (thus <HI>Tom</HI> went on) that you'll give me Leave to offer you my A&s;&s;i&s;tance.

<P><HI>That they did not u&s;ually drink with Strangers; but that he &s;eem'd &s;o much of a Gentleman, they wou'd wait upon him at that Hou&s;e there out of the Gate. Tom</HI> bowed, and went forwards; and the two Friends, immediately began to Scheme what they cou'd make of this Pigeon; for be it known to you, Reader, tho' &s;orry I am to bring you into &s;uch Com|pany; but the Livery-man's Friend was a profe&s;&s;ed Gambler.</P>
<P>What Name he had given him by his Godfather's; or, whether he had any Godfathers, remains a Doubt to this Day. His Mother was deliver'd of him in <HI>Bridewell,</HI> and from thence he was pro|perly brought up as a Link-boy, by the name of <HI>Young Glimm.</HI> This he afterwards
<PB N="121" REF="137">dre&s;&s;ed up as Captain <HI>Glimm,</HI> Squire <HI>Glimm,</HI> or Gentleman <HI>Glimm,</HI> from car|rying a Link; or, indeed, while he did carry a Link, he was very well practi&s;|ed in the Dexterity of Pocket-pick|ing; then he was a Bye-battle Boy; then a Bailey's Follower; from thence Waiter at a Bawdy-hou&s;e; from thence he went into the Country, for &s;ome Years, carrying on the various Trades, of drawing &s;ham Notes, pricking at the Belt, and Partner at an E O Table.

<P>They &s;oon came to <HI>Tom Fool;</HI> and after a Gla&s;s had gone round, Sir <HI>Phil|pot</HI>'s Son very ingenuou&s;ly told them the Rea&s;on he a&s;ked the Gentleman to drink with him. <HI>That he was come up to Lon|don on Purpo&s;e to find his Relations; and I heard, Sir</HI> (addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Footman) <HI>you call your&s;elf a Fool.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t beg your Pardon there, Sir (an&s;wered the Valet) I a'ant quite a Fool neither; tho' I have done &s;omething that I de&s;erve to be call'd &s;o for.</P>

<PB N="126" REF="142">fell on them with his Stick, for daring to &s;end any Man to him, to call him Fool. The Battle began to be warm, which brought the Landlord and <HI>Tom</HI> into the Room. <HI>Glimm</HI> ju&s;t then made a blow at the hone&s;t Fellow's Head; but he ducking, avoided his Fi&s;t, which fell heavily on the Innkeeper's right Cheek; the Force turn'd him half round; he ran down Stairs, crying out Murder, Murder, for a Con&s;table; luckily there was one in the Hou&s;e; who, after being a&s;&s;ur'd by every Body, there was no Fire-arms above, charged all the People in the Hou&s;e to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, Wo|men, as well as Men, and then up Stairs he went, in the King's Name.</P>
<P>But there was no Occa&s;ion for a Staff Officer, all was quiet; Mr. <HI>Toa&s;t</HI> was &s;eated in an Arm Chair, quite out of Breath; and in the oppo&s;ite Corner &s;tood <HI>Tom Fool,</HI> Centry over the two fallen Friends; and on his Shoulder, Mu&s;quet like, he re&s;ted a Poker, which he had twi&s;ted out of the Gamblers Hands.</P>
<P>It's odd how Things come to pa&s;s: A Gentleman, whom Curio&s;ity had handed up Stairs, no &s;ooner fixed his Eyes upon <HI>Glimm,</HI> but he charged the Con&s;table with him, for robbing him of

<P>Immediately every one in the Room, except the Valet, and <HI>Tom Fool,</HI> &s;eiz'd upon the Gambler; Landlord, Con&s;ta|ble, Drawer, Boot-ketcher, O&s;tler, and Travellers, as Bigots croud round a ho|ly Man, eager to touch his Garment, the poor Culprit, &s;urrounded like a &s;ul|len Ox in <HI>Smithfield,</HI> was lugg'd, pu&s;h|ed, pull'd, dragg'd, to Ju&s;tice; the out of Place Footman &s;neak'd away, leaving (according to all the &s;elf Laws in being) his Friend in Di&s;tre&s;s, lea&s;t he &s;hould be a&s;k'd to do &s;omething for him.</P>

<P>TOM FOOL's Behaviour exci|ted every Debtor's Curio&s;ity.&mdash; <HI>Such a hand&s;ome, well-dre&s;s'd Figure, and to have neither Woman nor Lawyer come after him!&mdash;Be&s;ides&mdash;he has not drank one Dram &s;ince he came among us.&mdash;He mu&s;t be &s;ome very extraordinary Per&s;on;&mdash;but who?</HI> They begg'd <HI>Jack Junior,</HI> who was the Gentleman of the Goal, to invite him to Supper, ju&s;t to pump him a little.</P>
<P><HI>Tom</HI> came, and a Propo&s;al was made, that each Per&s;on pre&s;ent, &s;hould relate the material Occurrences of his Life; and by what Accident, Misfortune, or Villainy, he was dragg'd to, and detain'd in that melancholy Receptacle.</P>
<P><HI>Junior</HI> approv'd the Motion, but begg'd to be excus'd from repeating his own Life, becau&s;e Mr. <HI>Mackendroch</HI> had methodi&s;ed it for the Pre&s;s, but he wou'd lend it that young Gentleman in the Morning, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to <HI>Tom Fool;</HI> for (continued he) I find, by his Conver&s;ation, he's a Scholar, and he'll give me his Opinion of it.&mdash;<HI>Tom</HI> blu&s;h'd and bow'd.</P>
<P>But that has no Occa&s;ion to &s;top us, a young Fellow ob&s;erved, who &s;at next to
<PB N="135" REF="153"><HI>Tom Fool.</HI> I believe my Life, if it was long enough, is as well worth Printing, as e'er a <HI>Pamela</HI> of 'em all.&mdash;You &s;hall be Judges, Gentlemen, whether I have not more Rea&s;on to complain of ill For|tune than any one Man under the Copes of Heaven.</P>
<P>Altho' the Per&s;on, who went for my Father, was but a Button-mould-maker; (<HI>Thus began</HI> Phill Poplin) I might be a greater Man's Son; for all the World knows he &s;ued a Gentleman for Crimi|nality of Conver&s;ation, and recover'd large Damages, ju&s;t as my Mother was brought to bed of me.</P>
<P>Some Folks wou'd have had him got a Divorce; but he told them, that tho' it was a &s;ure Thing, that my Mama had wrong'd his Bed at fir&s;t; but as the Law had given him proper Satisfaction, he did not think that he was wrong'd at all.</P>
<P>Yet he had as nice Notions as any body el&s;e; but he &s;aid, Honour was only fit for Gentlemen; and, for his Part, as he was a Trade&s;man, he mu&s;t have &s;omething more &s;ub&s;tantial to go to Market with.</P>
<P>My Mother and he were very happy afterwards; and I don't believe, except
<PB N="136" REF="154">to pay off a Play Debt or &s;o, &s;he was ever guilty again.</P>
<P>She play'd very deep indeed, &s;o was forc'd to admit, now and then, of an Intrigue, to make both Ends meet in Hou&s;e-keeping: But then &s;he went twice a Day to the Tabernacle in <HI>Moor-fields,</HI> and put her Behaviour, as a Ca&s;e of Con&s;cience, to one of the Teachers there.</P>
<P>After having thoroughly convinced him, that &s;he only &s;uffered Embraces merely to pre&s;erve the Peace of her Hu&s;|band's Mind, and not for the Sake of &s;atisfying any corrupt Pa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Thus he comforted her: For as I went with her, and &s;he made me take it all down in &s;hort Hand, I can repeat it <HI>Verbatum.</HI></P>
<P>"<HI>Child,</HI></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The Body is no more than a Bot|tle, that contains the Liquor of Life, and the Soul is the Spirit: And as we are divided into the Elect, and the Select; &s;o are we &s;ubdivided by Faith &endq;and Grace.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Now Faith is even as a fine Pickle, it prevents the Mind from being cor|rupted; and Grace is al&s;o as a fine Pre|&s;erve, candied by the Sweetmeats of the Enlightened. Therefore, when
<PB N="137" REF="155">we have drawn off the Mind from the impure Dregs of corporeal Con&s;an|guinities, heed not what happeneth to your outward Form;&mdash;For your Soul is &s;heath'd from the Worm of Sin, by the new Birth. So whatever you &s;uffer in Matter, you are unde|filed &endq;in Spirit.</Q>&mdash;(So indeed I be|lieve &s;he was) and &s;he received Rege|neration accordingly.</P>
<P>My Mama took care of my Edu|cation her&s;elf; and I will venture to &s;ay, that when I was but fourteen Years of Age, I was the be&s;t Scholar in the City, and was qualified to conver&s;e with the be&s;t Company in <HI>England;</HI> for I could &s;ing three <HI>French</HI> Songs, had all <HI>Alex|ander</HI> the Great, and <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Ovid's Epi&s;tles by Heart: And there was ne're a Duke or Lord that had married for ten Years la&s;t pa&s;t, but I knew into what Family, and cou'd repeat their Relations Names, as well as if I had been bred and born in the Univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>Then I went into <HI>Cornwall</HI> to be a La|dy's Page: Her Hu&s;band's Brother had been Lord Mayor of the City of <HI>London,</HI> &s;o &s;he took State upon her.</P>
<P>Mine was a pure ea&s;y Place, I only held up her Gown Tail, when &s;he went to Church; always call'd her my Lady,
<PB N="138" REF="156">read the New's-papers to her, and fed the Cats.</P>
<P>She died in four Years afterwards, and left me 200 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> I brought it up to <HI>Lon|don,</HI> and gave it my Mother. She was become a Widow, and liv'd very gen|teely upon telling Fortunes in Coffee-cups. You'd be amazed to &s;ee the fine Folks we had come to our Hou&s;e, in Chairs, Chariots, and Hackney Coaches.</P>
<P>To fini&s;h my Education, I went into <HI>Hart-Street,</HI> where they teach grown Gentlemen to dance; and did a Minuet and Lovre very well in a Week's Time, as my Ma&s;ter told me. Then my Mo|ther bought me &s;everal Coats and Wai&s;t|coats, all laced, as good as new; and told me, if I minded my Hits, I might carry off a Lady of Fortune.</P>
<P>I made my Appearance at Noon in the <HI>Park,</HI> and at Night in one of the Boxes in <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> Play-hou&s;e. I wou'd have gone to <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> indeed, but they were full. All the People in the Pit &s;tared at me; and if there had been any Ladies in the Boxes, I &s;hould have been as much look'd at by them: But I don't know how it is, People of Fa&s;hion won't go to the new Hou&s;e, they have got &s;uch an odd Notion, that there is
<PB N="139" REF="157">not a Set of a good Actors at one Hou&s;e, as at t'other.&mdash;It's a very unfair Way of judging I am &s;ure; for Mr. <HI>Rich</HI> gives his People as much Salary, and as many good Parts, as they do theirs at the other Hou&s;e: But as I have heard &s;everal of the <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> Actors &s;ay.&mdash;<HI>It's all a Party Affair.</HI></P>
<P>For a whole Week after I had appear'd in Public, we took in the News Papers, too &s;ee if no Lady had put in an Adverti&s;e|ment, about a young Gentleman in White and Blue, and Silver:&mdash;But my Time was not come, every Dog has his Day you know.</P>
<P>In the Club I u&s;ed at the Gentleman and Porter, we toa&s;ted all the fine La|dies of Quality: For the Set of Bucks there had been great with mo&s;t of them.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e great Ladies are ea&s;ily comat|table; it's only walking in the <HI>Park</HI> till they fix their Eyes upon you, and they'll &s;end their Footman to dog you Home; or el&s;e &s;itting down by them at the Ma&s;|querade, and chattering a-bit, and they'll take you to the Hummums, and in the Morning give you a Gold repeating Watch, a Diamond Ring, and a Pur&s;e of Gold.</P>
<P>For <HI>Tom Pirch,</HI> the Watch-maker's Son; <HI>Will Tippett,</HI> the Habit-maker,
<PB N="140" REF="158">and <HI>Ned Vampit,</HI> of <HI>Cranbourn-Alley;</HI> all had been &s;erv'd &s;o, as they told me them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>This made me long to be taken into Keeping, by &s;ome Woman of Quality; &mdash;tho' my Mama was again&s;t it, be|cau&s;e &s;he &s;aid I was inclinable to a Con|&s;umption; and I had then, as I have now, a little Touch of the A&s;thma.&mdash;So I mu&s;t beg Leave to re&s;t here a little.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXV.</HEAD>
<P>WALKING one Day in the <HI>Park,</HI> I &s;aw <HI>Tippet</HI> take his Leave of a very fine Lady: She had a Silk Furbe|low on; her Buckles &s;parkled, long broad Ribbons hung down her Hat; &s;he had the fine&s;t Complexion in the World, her Cheeks were as red as Vermillion; and &s;he darted her Eyes about, ju&s;t like Clock-work.</P>
<P>This I judged to be one of <HI>Will</HI>'s Women of Quality: So after he was out of Sight, I &s;idled up to her, and walked by her: She &s;miled at me very often. I wou'd have &s;aid &s;omething to her, but my Heart fail'd me: At la&s;t &s;he &s;aid, you &s;eem to know me, Sir; upon which (for I had my Speech ready) I reply'd, I had often before, at a Di&s;tance, ador'd her; but Fortune, till that Moment, had never been &s;o propitious, as to permit me the extatic Tran&s;port of telling her &s;o:&mdash;She &s;aid, pon her onner, &s;he did not under&s;tand me. I an&s;wered her again, and &s;he me; and &s;he kept walking till we came to <HI>Buckingham-Gate;</HI> &s;he complain'd &s;he was tired, and I prevail'd on her to &s;tep to the Inn there, and eat a Naples Bi&s;ket.</P>
<PB N="142" REF="160">
<P>Well, Gentlemen, you may believe me, or not; but what I tell you is Truth, and I'll take my Oath on't. I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash; there enjoy'd her.&mdash;I cannot tell you, what I thought of my&s;elf then, or of her afterwards: When &s;he axt me to lend her a Guinea,&mdash;I was in Amaze.&mdash;I told her, as &s;oon as I cou'd come to my&s;elf;&mdash;that I imagin'd &s;uch young Ladies as &s;he gave Gentlemen Money, not took any:&mdash;Upon which, &s;he &s;wore a great Oath, da&s;hed a Gla&s;s of Wine in my Face, &s;eiz'd me by the Shirt Collar, and tore it out of the Gathers; &s;aying&mdash; <HI>What, you Pimp, do you want to turn Pet|ticoat Pen&s;ioner.</HI> Then &s;he &s;natch'd my Sword.&mdash;Nay, I thought &s;he wou'd have &s;tuck me with it, for &s;he half drew it; but I gave her a Moidore, and Half-a-Crown for Coach-hire; &s;o we drank, and were Friends.</P>
<P>This Accident made me very careful of engaging in another Intrigue;&mdash;as I was at a Lo&s;s how to pick the Good from the Bad: For you know, Gentlemen, they Dre&s;s as much alike, as can be; but whether that is the Women of Fa&s;hion's, or the Women of the Town's Fault, I cannot tell</P>
<P>Some few Days after, a Gentleman of my Mother's Acquaintance, took her
<PB N="143" REF="161">and me into the Pit at <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> Hou&s;e; and ju&s;t before the Play began, into the right-hand Stage Box came the fine Mi&s;s <HI>Demirep.</HI>&mdash;My Mother whi&s;|per'd me her Name; told me that was my Mark, and bid me begin Ogling.&mdash; I watch'd her Eyes;&mdash;&s;he threw them about at Random: I cou'd not meet them, tho' I had made mine Water with Straining, till after the fir&s;t Act was over. When &s;he perceiv'd me, I began to langui&s;h indeed, and with great Suc|ce&s;s: For tho' Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> acted that Night, &s;he was always looking at me, except when he was upon the Stage.</P>
<P>I got out before her, as my Mother bid me, waited at the Box Doors, &s;aw her get into her Chair. I bow'd to her. She &s;aw me thro' her Gla&s;&s;es, and return'd it.&mdash;Away &s;he went, &s;wing, &s;wang.&mdash;I followed,&mdash;tho' I &s;poiled a new Pair of white Silk Stockings by it; for it was wet Weather, and &s;he liv'd as far as <HI>Gro&s;|venor-Street.</HI>&mdash;I &s;aw her hous'd, I went backward and forward, by her Door, for two Hours after; but I fancy &s;he did not know I was there, becau&s;e I cou'd not keep up with her Chairmen.</P>
<P>Next Day, about Noon, I walk'd by her Hou&s;e again, upon the Pavement, on t'other Side of the Way. She &s;aw
<PB N="144" REF="162">me, and threw up the Sa&s;h; I made her a Bow, and walk'd off toward the <HI>Park;</HI> but &s;he did'nt come into the Mall that Day, for it fell a Raining.</P>
<P>Next Day I went again; &s;he was up one Pair of Stairs, and another fine La|dy with her. And I did not de&s;pair, after my being acquainted with Mi&s;s <HI>Demirep,</HI> to have that young Lady too, and &s;o have two Strings to my Bow. Up went the Sa&s;h again; but as I was looking at them, not minding my Feet, I fell over a Chair Pole; my Sword was entangled in my Coat Skirts, and my Hands all in the Mud; and the Mob Hollowed &s;o, I was ready to die with Vexation. When I was pick'd up, and had recover'd my&s;elf, the Sa&s;h was down, the Ladies gone, but the Street Door was open, and a Servant beckon'd me to him, and &s;lily gave me a Paper, all ty'd like a true Lover's Knot, and in it was,</P>

<P>It was a very melancholy Spot. How|ever, I hired a Couple of Men to guard me, and away I went to the Place of A&s;&s;ignation. The Night was very tem|pe&s;tuous; we never &s;aw ne'er a Soul 'till pa&s;t one o'Clock. Then her Servant came, who made an Excu&s;e for his La|dy: That &s;he was unexpectedly en|gaged, but wou'd be there is le&s;s than two Hours. I &s;taid there 'till pa&s;t Three, almo&s;t peri&s;h'd with Cold and Rain. The People I hired, wou'd not &s;tay any longer without Drink;&mdash;The Watchman wou'd not fetch it: And I wou'd not let them leave me there alone; &s;o we all three went to a Night-Cellar.</P>
<P>In the Interim, to &s;ee that Providence &s;hou'd contrive it &s;o, Mi&s;s <HI>Demirep</HI> came by in her Chariot: Vex'd to be &s;ure &s;he was, but &s;till, what won't a Lady in love forgive; &s;he order'd me to be there at the &s;ame Hour, in three Nights Time.</P>
<P>I went Home to my Mother's, to go to Bed; but &s;he and the Gentleman, who had treated us at the Play, and a young Lady &s;he had &s;tole for him by Fortune|telling, were all &s;et forward for <HI>France</HI> together, my Money and all, as &s;he told me in a Latter &s;he left for me. To add

<P>The&s;e Things, you'll &s;ay, wou'd have turn'd &s;ome Folks Brain; but I knew Mi&s;s <HI>Demirep</HI> had Watches enough, and as for Money,&mdash;&s;he had enough of that too.</P>
<P>I call'd next Day at the Gentleman and Porter, told our Club my good Luck, &s;hewed them Mi&s;s <HI>Demirep</HI>'s Let|ter. They bid me take Care of my&s;elf, for <HI>Tippet</HI> was then keeping his Bed, up|on Account of a Gentleman, who heard him mention a great Lady's Name, and &s;ay he had danc'd, and drank Tea with her. When the Gentleman came to ex|amine him, as the Devil wou'd have it, <HI>Tom</HI> cou'd not tell if &s;he was a black Woman, or a fair One, or &s;hort, or tall. So he got &s;uch a Beating, the Surgeon &s;ays, he never will be his own Man again.</P>
<P>But now, Gentlemen, judge if my Ca&s;e is not the harde&s;t in the whole World; for in&s;tead of being able to meet Mi&s;s <HI>Demirep,</HI> I was taken ill at Tea-time, of &s;omething like the &s;potted Fe|ver: Whether that impudent Woman at <HI>Buckingham-Gate,</HI> that I drank with, gave me any Poi&s;on in my Gla&s;s, when
<PB N="147" REF="167">we drank Friends, I can't tell;&mdash;but I was forc'd to keep my Room nine Weeks, all in Flannels, and to make away with my Cloaths; and after I was well the Doctor &s;ent me here for not paying him.</P>
<P>There was &s;omething &s;o very perti|nent in <HI>Junior</HI>'s Remarks upon the fore|going Narration; that altho' the tran|&s;criber re&s;olv'd not to &s;uffer one &s;erious Sentence to be introduc'd into this Per|formance, he can't help for once, and only once, to alter his Method.</P>

Not knowing properly how to di&s;po&s;e of her Babe, &s;he recommended it to Providence on the Church-wardens Thre&s;hold. Pro|vidence pre&s;erv'd the Infant, the Over|&s;eers took Charge of it, and the Innocent was neither Overlaid, Starved, Blinded, or Lamed.

<P>When the Boy cou'd go alone, he was hired by a Beggar-woman; from thence convey'd to a Gang of Gyp&s;ies: With them he &s;troled, until the Age of Six|teen. Then a Clergyman, (before whom he was brought, for making too free with a Cock at <HI>Shrove-tide;</HI>) in Hopes to

<P>Among this Common-wealth of Men|dicants, the fair <HI>Renegada</HI> was brought to Bed of a Son.</P>
<P>After the young Lady was out of her Straw, a Committee was appointed to name the Child; but the Father pro|te&s;ted again&s;t that Motion; for as he had no Name him&s;elf, why &s;hould his Son? <HI>For you know</HI> (directing his Di&s;|cour&s;e to the Queen of the A&s;&s;embly) Yes, I do know, reply'd the wrinkled Regi&s;ter of Times long pa&s;t.

<P>The exce&s;&s;ive Fondne&s;s which <HI>Junior</HI>'s Mother was guilty of towards her fir&s;t|born, almo&s;t ruin'd the child; In&s;tead of &s;uffering him to be brought up in the <HI>Lacedemonian</HI> Manner; a Manner in which all true Gyp&s;ies are con&s;tituted, &s;he kept him in clean Linnen, wa&s;h'd his Face with Lemon-juice, to take the Tan off, and wou'd not let him walk bare|foot for the World.&mdash;As to practi&s;ing Cards and Dice, and the Dexterity of each, &s;he was not again&s;t; becau&s;e, as &s;he &s;aid by and by, he wou'd be in high Life, &s;he hop'd, and therefore it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary he &s;hou'd know how to behave him&s;elf.

As to the re&s;t of the Actors, and Actre&s;&s;es, they were billeted away to boil Tea-kettles with.</P>
<P><HI>Junior,</HI> and the Lady of the Show, prepar'd for <HI>London;</HI> but on the fir&s;t Evening of their Journey, a recruiting Serjeant, who had formerly been ac|quainted with the Party <HI>Junior</HI> was e&s;|corting, join'd them. When old Friends meet, they have always &s;omething par|ticular to &s;ay to one another; but that Conver&s;ation was po&s;tpon'd 'till <HI>Junior</HI> &s;hou'd be a&s;leep; and then Slip-&s;hod,
<PB N="160" REF="180">with only her under Petticoat on, &s;oftly crept to the Military's Apartment.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner did <HI>Junior</HI> perceive her leave the Bed (for he had overheard the A|greement, and therefore counterfeited Sleep) but Jealou&s;y, foul-feeding Fiend, took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Brea&s;t, Bo&s;om, and Stomach; thence &s;ublimating to his Head, it there met the Daemon Drunkenne&s;s, al|ready Tenant of the pineal Gland, the Soul's chief Seat. He aro&s;e all Uproar; and huddling on his Cloaths, he rumpled up in his Arms, Gown, Stays, Stockings, Apron, and quilted Petticoat, the Apparel belonging to his fair Incon&s;tant, and vow'd with a loud Vow, he wou'd &s;a|crifice them to his Re&s;entment in the Kitchen Fire.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t a the Moment he was hurrying down the Stair-ca&s;e of the Inn, to put his fatal Re&s;olves in Execution, one of the Quorum was hobbling up to Bed; the Chambermaid, with a long Candle in her Hand, and a Pan of Coals under her Arm, preceded his Wor&s;hip; and <HI>Will</HI> the Waiter brought up the Rear, with a large <HI>China</HI> Ba&s;on full of Sack Whey.</P>
<P>Blinded by Revenge, <HI>Junior</HI> broke the Cavalcade, by beating down the Maid; back on the Ju&s;tice &s;he fell; the burn|ing
<PB N="161" REF="181">Coals came all over his Honour, and his Honour all into the Sack Whey.</P>
<P>The Perpetrator of this Fact dropp'd the Bundle, de&s;tin'd to the Flames; and crawling over the fallen Carca&s;&s;es, made his E&s;cape into the Yard. The Darkne&s;s of the Night a&s;&s;i&s;ting, he eluded his Pur|&s;uers, by &s;ecreting him&s;elf in the Boot of a Stage Coach.</P>
<P>Before the taper Fingers of Mi&s;s Morning had lifted up the Portcullis of the Ecliptic, the O&s;tler unbolted the Gates of the Inn, to expedite &s;ome <HI>Scotch</HI> Merchants. <HI>Junior</HI> took that Opportu|nity, unperceiv'd, crept from his Lurk|ing-place, and followed the <HI>North Briti&s;h</HI> Dealers.</P>
<P>He &s;topp'd at the Turnpike, re&s;olving to wait there, 'till Mr. <HI>Dill</HI> the Serjeant came up, and demand Satisfaction; <HI>Junior</HI> being determined not to &s;uffer &s;uch an Indignity to be ca&s;t upon his Honour.</P>
<P>For Honour is the innate Principle of choice Spirits; it acts upon Mankind, as In&s;tinct in&s;tigates all other Animals: It is like a good Complexion, any body may wear it: It is like the Philo&s;opher's Stone, it brings great Riches by Tran&s;|mutation; it is like a Maidenhead, often &s;old over and over; it is a Waterman's

<P>Very true indeed, Mr. <HI>Punch,</HI> reply'd a Voice out of the Pit, and in&s;tantly upro&s;e an aldermanic Figure, tottering; and clamber'd upon one of the Benches, which were only Bits of Deals, laid on old Chairs, and empty Butter-firkins.</P>
<P>He bow'd his bu&s;hy Bob; cough'd, &s;pit, and began; <Q>Ladies, and Gentle|men, &startq;I wou'd not offer to &s;peak before &s;o &s;elect a Company as this, had I not been honour'd in <HI>London,</HI> with At|tention; not only at the <HI>Robin Hood,</HI> but Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI>'s that was; but al&s;o at &s;everal Club-meetings, where the Good of my Country has been more &endq;immediately concern'd.</Q></P>

<P><Q>&startq;As for me, Gentlemen, I am a Taylor, and I have bred up my Son to my own Bu&s;ine&s;s; for I am not one of tho&s;e Fathers, who would'n't have their Children take after their Parents Mea|&s;ures. No, my Son is a Taylor, and I hope his Son's Sons will be the &s;ame, that the Trade may be pre|&s;erv'd by a Remnant of our Family. But the Ca&s;e is this: My Son has work'd Night and Day to fini&s;h a Suit (for a great, what do you call um, Actor) expecting to get much Reputation; the Cloaths being to be looked at by &s;o many Poeple, in the Boxes and Pit; for to be well dre&s;s'd is half the Battle, and the Audience will naturally a&s;k, who made that Suit?&mdash;But all on a &s;udden, Mr. what's his Name won't play, and &s;o the Town's di&s;appointed of &s;eeing a &endq;fine Dre&s;s.</Q></P>

<P><Q>&startq;If this was &s;ettled in <HI>London,</HI> it wou'd &s;oon become a Fa&s;hion in the Country; and as Mr. <HI>Punch</HI> ob&s;erves, &s;ince the Theatres have copied &s;everal of their Entertainments from his Puppet-&s;how, it won't be any Di&s;grace to Mr. <HI>Punch,</HI> to take on Fa&s;hion &endq;from the Play-hou&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Ma&s;k,</HI> tired with his Harangue, that In&s;tant hit him in the Forehead with half an Orange; the Fright made him reel, and not being &s;olidly &s;up|ported, he fell down on a <HI>London</HI> Rider's Head, who had lean'd forwards to &s;a|lute a young Woman on the Bench be|fore him.</P>
<P>The Gallant's Face came flat again&s;t the Girl's Stomach; down &s;he fell be|tween the Seats, almo&s;t breathle&s;s, un|derneath Mr. <HI>Twi&s;t</HI> the Orator.</P>

<P>Thus it is recorded, the Tunny and Sword-fi&s;h attack the Whale.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Ma&s;k</HI> had heard there were half a Score Recruits drinking at the next Door; to them &s;he &s;ent five Shillings, and In&s;tructions for their Behaviour; and ju&s;t as the People began to call again for King <HI>Pepin,</HI> the&s;e young Soldiers run upon the Stage; crying out, King <HI>George</HI> for ever, and no <HI>Jacobites,</HI> nor King <HI>Pepin</HI>'s neither.</P>
<P>This affronted the Pit People, and they began to pelt the military Folks.</P>
<P>The Recruits, not having any Wea|pons, &s;eiz'd the Puppets, and volley'd them among the Audience.</P>

White as the Dai&s;y was her Skin, blue as the Violet her Eyes, a &s;ettled Langui&s;h was &s;pread on her Face, which awaken'd the tendere&s;t Sen&s;ations in her Admirers.</P>
<P>The Delicacy of her Form, and her languid Air, made an indelible Im|pre&s;&s;ion on the &s;oft, the Feminine-like Figure of Sir <HI>Paily Tin&s;y,</HI> from the <HI>We&s;t Indies;</HI> he look'd like his Sugar Canes, tall, thin, &s;hining, and &s;allow.</P>
<PB N="206" REF="226">
<P>Such a Parity in Complexion begat a Sympathy, a&mdash;or a De&s;ire&mdash;or a&mdash;they wi&s;h'd to be acquainted, and luckily meeting at a Milliner's, an Appoint|ment was made, and they drank Tea in Mrs. *** fir&s;t Floor.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Paily,</HI> at that Interview, di&s;co|ver'd the mo&s;t pure, the mo&s;t perfect, and mo&s;t innocent Pa&s;&s;ion: He play'd with her Locks, as they curl'd in her Neck; combed them out twenty Times, &s;aluted the Tips of her Fingers, knelt down, and adored her Feet; and made her a Pre&s;ent of a new Receipt to make cold Cream.</P>
<P><HI>Matilda</HI> was everjoy'd at &s;o tender, &s;o delicate a Lover; and in&s;tantly made him her Platonic: He too was in Rap|tures, to find a Lady, who, like him, de|&s;pis'd the rude Concatenation of coar&s;e ma&s;culine Embraces.</P>
<P>As Sir <HI>Paily</HI> took his Leave, he pre|&s;ented her with an extreme neat Pair of Tablets; out of which, as &s;he opened them, dropp'd a Paper. She &s;natch'd it up, expecting to &s;ee, on the Top, <HI>upon Sight; &mdash; or, I promi&s;e to pay;</HI> but when &s;he r$$d an Addre&s;s to the too love$y <HI>Mr $word$,</HI> on her drinking the Wa$$rs. &s;he &s;$$iled, bit her Lip, folded the P$$try up, like a Thread-paper;
<PB N="207" REF="227">and, without examining the Merit of the Ver&s;es, to&s;s'd them into the Fire; call'd for a Chair, and at her Si&s;ter's &s;he met <HI>Junior,</HI> who was come to pay <HI>Batilda</HI> his fir&s;t Vi&s;it.</P>
<P><HI>Junior</HI> had been long acquainted with the Si&s;ter Heroins. And after <HI>Matilda</HI> had related the Reception &s;he met with from Sir <HI>Tin&s;y,</HI> they laid a Scheme a|gain&s;t the Knight (ju&s;t for a Laugh) which they put in Practice next Day.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Paily,</HI> according to Appointment, was &s;eated on a Couch, with <HI>Matilda;</HI> and had ju&s;t unfolded his &s;trong-&s;cented Cambric Handkerchief; which he put round the Lady's Neck, fearing, as he ob&s;erved to her, &s;he might catch Cold, &s;ince he &s;aw &s;he had only a Sattin Wrapper on; and the Wind was &s;o high, out of Doors, it might blow in, through the Crevices of the Sa&s;hes, upon the Pit of her Stomach. Ju&s;t then <HI>Batilda</HI> came running up Stairs, out of Breath; and, opening the Door, cry'd out affrighed, Oh, <HI>Matty, Matty,</HI> we are ruined, here's my Brother.&mdash;That very Moment in ru&s;h'd <HI>Junior,</HI> with his drawn Sword, and down with a Shriek &s;unk <HI>Matilda.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Paily</HI> dropp'd as in&s;tantaneou&s;ly; the &s;udden Blaze of the Sword Blade
<PB N="208" REF="228">frightened him into a real Fit, and he fainted on the Floor; as a Lilly bows his Head to the Earth, puffed down by a Gu&s;t of Wind.</P>
<P><HI>Junior</HI> hurried away <HI>Matilda;</HI> but it was above an Hour before the other Si&s;ter cou'd bring the Baronet to him|&s;elf, or per&s;uade him he was not hurt: He begg'd to be convey'd Home with Safety; and that <HI>Batilda</HI> wou'd e&s;cort him. His Fright was &s;o great, he ne|ver once enquired after <HI>Matilda,</HI> till he was &s;afe in his own Bed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Batilda</HI> told him, their Brother was a Sea Officer, of a very revengeful Di&s;po&s;ition; and exaggerated, or indeed invented &s;uch Stories of his Behaviour, that Sir <HI>Paily,</HI> to make Friends with <HI>Matilda</HI>'s Family, and per&s;erve his own Life, executed a Deed of Gift, wherein he made his whole <HI>York&s;hire</HI> E&s;tate, left him by his elder Brother, chargeable with an Annuity of 200 <ABBR>l.</ABBR><HI>per Annum</HI> to Mi&s;s <HI>Matilda;</HI> and made her Si&s;ter a Pre&s;ent of a fine Service of Plate; and was then convey'd out of Town, in a Hor&s;e Litter.</P>

<P>Oh!

<P>About a Month ago, I was with Lady <HI>Beltre,</HI> in the Stage Box, at <HI>Garrick</HI>'s, to &s;ee him do <HI>Benedict;</HI>&mdash;I doat upon his <HI>Benedict.</HI>&mdash;After the fir&s;t Act was over, Lady <HI>Kitty</HI> twitch'd me by the Sleeve, and begg'd me ju&s;t to give a Glance at a Figure in the Pit, clo&s;e under us, who had been ogling me for the la&s;t ten Mi|nutes. I &s;tar'd at the Wretch; but as &s;oon as he &s;aw me ob&s;erve him, he gave
<PB N="214" REF="234">&s;uch a Look, I have been &s;ick of all Eye-language ever &s;ince. Such a Langui&s;h, as if &s;omebody was treading upon his Feet, and he was fainting away with the Agony. Then he &s;eem'd to &s;igh, and &s;imper'd, and bow'd. I a&s;k'd <HI>Kitty,</HI> if &s;he did not think he was a Lunatic: She begg'd I wou'd carry it on a little; you know what an enticing Devil &s;he is, as there's no denying her any Thing.&mdash;Therefore, as Mr. <HI>Bays</HI> &s;ays, I gave him Fla&s;h for Fla&s;h; that, by the Time the Curtain dropp'd, we had look'd our&s;elves into a very intimate Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Between Play and Entertainment, he was mounted upon the Pit Seats, that I might have a full View of his Per&s;on; and &s;uch a Per&s;on!&mdash;I cou'd compare him to nothing but a Boy Jockey, who had been violently wa&s;ting him&s;elf; he look'd &s;o &s;mall, and &s;o &s;allow, as fit for a Lover, as I am to make a Chairman.</P>
<P>He was dre&s;s'd, ta&s;tele&s;s and taw|dry; &s;omewhat between Footman and Fop; a little Cuff to his Coat, trimm'd with a little Edging; a little Cape to his Wai&s;tcoat, his Wai&s;tcoat ju&s;t reaching to his Watch String.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as I was &s;ettled in my Chair, I &s;aw the Thing again, bowing to the Gla&s;&s;es. He look'd &s;o pale, and &s;o pi|tiful,
<PB N="215" REF="235">had I not &s;een him before, I &s;hou'd have taken him for &s;omebody a&s;king Charity.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Beltre</HI> &s;upp'd with me that Night, and we chatted above an Hour, about the Audacity of tho&s;e Breeches Wearers, who a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves the Name of Intriguers.</P>
<P>She vow'd, this Conque&s;t of mine was worth twenty Plays; that he look'd too tender to be incon&s;tant; hoped the Affair wou'd la&s;t till <HI>Scarborough</HI> Sea&s;on; and then it &s;hou'd be fairly copied out, and &s;ent to one of the Circulating Li|brary Shops; and it wou'd make a very pretty Book; and it &s;hou'd be called <HI>The Cobweb; or, Love in a Wink; or, &s;ome other Curio&s;ity-rai&s;ing Title.</HI></P>
<P>Next Morning &s;he called on me, to go to <HI>Langford</HI>'s; and as &s;he &s;tood at the Sa&s;h, cry'd out, <Q><HI>Behold, my Lord, look &startq;&endq;where it comes again;</HI></Q> and, indeed, on the oppo&s;ite Pavement, &s;tood the Ogler.&mdash;The next Day it came again, I did not care to joke any longer with the poor Devil. But &s;he conjured me to give her Leave a little; for if &s;uch In&s;olence was not curbed, &s;he &s;aid, we &s;hou'd &s;hortly have every City Prentice come into St. <HI>James</HI>'s Pari&s;h, &s;erenading.</P>
<PB N="216" REF="236">
<P>As I flung up the Sa&s;h, the Wretch attempted to make me a Bow, but fell over the Chairmens Poles; and I was obliged to leave the Window, that he might not di&s;cover my Laughing.</P>
<P>That wicked Devil, Lady <HI>Kitty,</HI> made him an Appointment, under <HI>Bedford-hou&s;e Wall,</HI> that Night at Twelve: We went to <HI>Ke&s;k</HI>'s Rout; and, returning about Four, <HI>Beltre</HI> begged me to drive round the Square, as it had been a ter|rible Night; only to &s;ee what Sort of a Figure a drench'd Lover was, when alive.</P>
<P>The Watchman told us, the Gentle|man was ju&s;t gone off his Po&s;t, to dry him&s;elf; we left Word for him, not to catch Cold, and be there that Night Se'nnight, at the &s;ame Hour&mdash;but he came no more.&mdash;<HI>His Courage was cool'd</HI>&mdash;and I wou'd advi&s;e all Ladies, who are teiz'd by Impertinents, to pre&s;cribe to their Tormentors&mdash;a cold Night, and a &s;oaking Shower; it will damp all &s;uch Animals De&s;ires.</P>

But &mdash;Beauty, is not more the Ladies Pro|perty, than Pre&s;ence of Mind.&mdash;She ad|dre&s;s'd her&s;elf immediately to Mynheer, thus: Sir, I am &s;urpriz'd, after not hearing from you for four Po&s;ts, you &s;hou'd &s;o abruptly &s;end for me, without previous Notice; and an Accident has happen'd to me here, as I wrote you word to <HI>London,</HI>&mdash;but receiv'd no An|&s;wer; which reduc'd me to &s;uch Straights, that if it had not been for this Gentle|man, <HI>(pointing to Mr. I&s;rael)</HI> I don't know how I cou'd either have &s;taid here, or left the Place with Honour:&mdash;But I am con&s;cious, nay convinc'd, that your pretended Regard for me is Selfi&s;hne&s;s; for contrary to your Promi&s;e, you have expos'd our Intimacy, to this Gentle|man: But when once a Man forfeits his Honour with me,&mdash;I &s;hall acknowledge him no more to be my Friend.&mdash;Then
<PB N="223" REF="243">with a becoming Haughtine&s;s, turn'd her&s;elf round, and &s;lapp'd the Door after her, with &s;uch a Force, that made the Sa&s;hes rattle in their Frames. After &s;he was gone, for &s;ome Moments, the Brace of Rivals &s;tood &s;taring at each other. Mr. <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> with a Shrug, arming both his No&s;trils with Rappee; and Mynheer at the &s;ame Time drinking off a Tumb|ler of Wine.&mdash;Then,&mdash;O <HI>Mars, Bellona,</HI> with <HI>Moloch Carthaginian</HI> Babe-burner&mdash; attend, teach me to paint what Mi&s;chief might have happen'd.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Junior</HI> was in the next Room, waiting with Impatience to hear how the Affair wou'd fini&s;h: When, much to his Surprize, it terminated in a very friendly Charter-party, without a Blow &s;truck, or an ill Word given.</P>
<P>For it happen'd, Indigo at that Time was ri&s;ing, and Mr. <HI>Ben I&s;rael</HI> had 300 Barrels by him. This Mynheer knew, &mdash;therefore came to the following Com|promi&s;e. They were to go equal Sharers in the Indigo, and Mr. <HI>I&s;rael</HI> was to have 3/14 of <HI>Batilda.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as <HI>Junior</HI> heard the Agree|ment, he ha&s;ten'd to the Si&s;ters Apart|ment, to acquaint them with it; then told them Mi&s;s <HI>Ma&s;k</HI>'s De&s;ign on the
<PB N="224" REF="244"><HI>Jew,</HI> with the Scheme he had laid to de|&s;troy the Intrigue.</P>
<P>In le&s;s than an Hour after, <HI>Batilda</HI> receiv'd a very pre&s;&s;ing Billet from Mynheer, with a very hand&s;ome Apo|logy, <HI>viz.</HI> a Draught for fifty Pounds: She honour'd the Bill, and had a Chair call'd in&s;tantly.</P>
<P>The Sun next Morning had been &s;ome|time &s;ettled in his Coach-box;&mdash;but we have had Sun enough,&mdash;at lea&s;t, I don't find many People mind it now-a-Days, except Butter-factors, Poets, and Hay|makers, &mdash; we &s;hall &s;ay no more about it; but come to that remarkable Evening, when Mi&s;s <HI>Ma&s;k,</HI> and Mr. <HI>I&s;|rael,</HI> met at the Lodging <HI>Junior</HI> pro|vided for them.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as the Di&s;ciple of <HI>Aaron</HI> flopp'd into Bed,&mdash;and the Lady with circling Arms;&mdash;that very In&s;tant, Squire <HI>Sin|gleten</HI> loudly thunder'd at the Door,&mdash; &s;wearing and threatning,&mdash;the fright|ned Gallant, tumbled out of Bed, as the Door was bur&s;t open, and &s;crambled up another Pair of Stairs, in his Shirt, which led into a Garret; the Door of which he bolted after him, and then made his Way very nimbly out upon the Leads; &s;uch Agility is be&s;tow'd by Fear. The Squire
<PB N="225" REF="245">flew after him, and the Lady leap'd out of Bed, when the Rivals left the Room; bolted the Door they had hur|ried out of, and then examined Mr. <HI>I&s;rael</HI>'s wearing Apparel. After &s;he had &s;erv'd her&s;elf, with what Part of the Spoil &s;he thought proper, went Home, as ea&s;y, as if &s;he was but ju&s;t come from the Pump-room.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>Singleten</HI> bawl'd him&s;elf hoar&s;e, before he cou'd be releas'd; for Mr. <HI>I&s;rael</HI> had bolted him out, and Mi&s;s lock'd him in; &s;o that he was im|mur'd, upon a dark Stair-ca&s;e, till <HI>Ju|nior,</HI> with <HI>Matilda,</HI> who came by <HI>acci|dentally,</HI> deliver'd him from his Confine|ment.</P>
<P>Along the Gutter of the Leads, the affrighted <HI>Hebrew</HI> kept crawling, till a friendly Ca&s;ement, that was open'd, &s;eem'd to promi&s;e him a favourable Shel|ter: He crept in, and &s;tood &s;hivering, &mdash;afflicted with what the Phy&s;ico-learned call a complex Trepidation,&mdash; an Ague Fit, and the Fear of Death.</P>
<P>Naked as he was, down he &s;quatted on an old Trunk; the only Piece of Fur|niture belonging to the Room.</P>
<P>Now, as this happen'd to be <HI>Sunday</HI> Evening, there was a Rout in the fir&s;t Floor of the Hou&s;e, where Mr. <HI>I&s;rael</HI>
<PB N="226" REF="246">had &s;ecreted him&s;elf: And the Servants, who had mo&s;t of them more Religion than their Betters, were in the Kitchen, talking about Witches, Apparitions, <HI>Bett Canning,</HI> and the Comet.</P>
<P>But my Lord's Butler, who had been making him&s;elf, and Friends merry, with his Ma&s;ter's <HI>Madeira,</HI> came in and un&s;ettled all their Opinions. For as he &s;et up for a very fine Gentleman, he con&s;equently ridicul'd all Belief: Upon which <HI>Ned,</HI> my Lady <HI>Langui&s;h</HI>'s Foot|man, ob&s;erv'd, that there was a Garret, in the very Hou&s;e they were then in, haunted; and if Mr. <HI>William,</HI> and Sir <HI>Thomas</HI>'s Gentleman, and Lord <HI>Robert</HI>'s, wou'd go up with him, to be Witne&s;&s;es he did fair, he'd lay the Butler a Dozen of Beer;&mdash;that he wou'd carry up the Butler's Hat, and put it into an old Trunk, which &s;tood in that Room, and leave a Candle burning by it, and that he, the Butler, did not go up by him|&s;elf, and bring his Hat down again, for all his making &s;o much Game about going to Church.</P>
<P>The Wager was accepted; and ju&s;t before Mr. <HI>I&s;rael</HI> came in, the Hat had been hid in the Trunk, and the Candle left burning on the middle of the Floor; and as the di&s;appointed <HI>Hebrew</HI> had
<PB N="227" REF="247">&s;eated him&s;elf on the Trunk, up came the Butler to fetch his Hat. As he o|pen'd the Door, he &s;aw a Thing all in White. Struck with the Sight, he gra&s;p'd the Door Edge fa&s;t with one Hand, and with the other cover'd his Eyes; &s;aying, <HI>In the Name of the Father, who,&mdash;who, &mdash;who are you? If there's any body in the Room, &s;peak.</HI> The Severity of the Night had put it out of the Power of <HI>Ben I&s;rael</HI> to be articulate. In&s;tead of replying, his Teeth only chatter'd in his Head.&mdash; <HI>What! Do you gna&s;h your Teeth at me, me, me, me?</HI> Stutter'd out the Servant. <HI>I never did any Harm in my Life. I never committed Murder.</HI> The <HI>Jew</HI> advanc'd towards him; the Butler retreated back|wards, and down Stairs he fell, rowling, roaring. Mr. <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> barefoot, padding &s;oftly after him.</P>
<P>Into the Card-room bur&s;t the Butler; crying out, <HI>The Devil, the Devil's a coming.</HI> The Card Company &s;tarted up all at once, and run to the Door; tho&s;e behind, pre&s;&s;ing upon the fore|mo&s;t, till the Landing-place was crowd|ed with the very be&s;t Company.&mdash; But as &s;oon as Mr. <HI>I&s;rael</HI> &s;tood in View; what &s;hrieking, &s;hrinking, hiding, and hurrying, to return into the Room: But the Door-way was wedg'd up by Sir
<PB N="228" REF="248"><HI>Pur&s;y Pimple,</HI> who was running out, as Sir <HI>Squelchy Squab</HI> was ru&s;hing in; their Bellies meeting in Midway, they &s;trove to &s;queeze by each other, but were fa&s;t fix'd, jamm'd like <HI>Milos</HI> Fi&s;ts between the Timbers.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Jew</HI> de&s;cended lower, the Noi&s;e became greater: Helter-&s;kelter hurried the affrighted Rout.&mdash;Mothers beat down their Daughters; Wives over|&s;et their Hu&s;bands; Beaux broke their Shins over the Banni&s;ters, and fine La|dies tumbled Top&s;y-turvy,&mdash;like <HI>Quixote</HI> amid&s;t the Sheep, or like a Swimmer in a turbulent Sea, or like a Hare over Furze-bu&s;hes. So Mr. <HI>I&s;rael</HI> &s;crambled, crawl'd, and clamber'd, till he found a fall'n Roquelau, which he wrapp'd him|&s;elf about with, and &s;ecretly crept Home.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as Mr. <HI>Fool</HI> had read to this Line, Mr. <HI>Mackendroch</HI> enter'd his A|partment, and with much Apology, de|&s;ir'd the Return of Mr. <HI>Junior</HI>'s Adven|tures;&mdash;for that Gentleman had made up his Affairs, and the Manu&s;cript was to be put into his Creditors Hands, as Part of their Security.</P>

<P>AN Act of In&s;olvency gave <HI>Tom</HI> his Di&s;charge: Ragged as he was, he &s;at out for the Country, re&s;olving to get Employment in Hu&s;bandry. But, poor Fellow, when he a&s;k'd for Work, they enquired, where he came from? When he told them; they an&s;wered, they would have nothing to &s;ay to a Jail Bird; and if he begg'd, he was threatened with the Whipping Po&s;t.</P>
<P>But as it happened to be Blackberry-time with them, and Spring Water in a|bundance (which few People deny'd him) he travelled three Days. On the fourth, he came up to an old grey-headed Man; who was wringing his Hands, and cry|ing bitterly. <HI>Tom</HI> very kindly enquired what was the Matter with him? Upon which, as well as Tears would give him Leave, the poor old Man told him he was blind, and had been &s;o for many Years; but by the Help of a Dog, he had got a good Living, and a&s;k'd Cha|rity. But now, Sir, I mu&s;t &s;tarve, I mu&s;t &s;tarve, now &mdash; my poor Dog is hang'd.</P>

<P>Mad, no, no, no, but tho&s;e that kill'd him were. I'll tell you, Sir, a|bout four Miles off there is a great Inn; the Gentry u&s;e it, as they go to <HI>Tunbridge.</HI> I went there To-day, Sir, to get a little broken Victuals; it was the Heat of the Day, and I fell a&s;leep: In the mean Time, Sir, the Waiters &s;tole away my Dog, my poor Dog; methinks I hear him now. They &s;tole him, Sir, ju&s;t to plea&s;e a Couple of rich Gentlemen; Bloods, as I heard them call'd. They hung my poor Dog over the Sign Po&s;t; his Shrieks waked me; but I could neither help him, nor my|&s;elf. I kneel'd to 'em, I pray'd, I cry'd, but I was only laugh'd at. One of them, as I was upon my Knees, poured a Pail of Water upon my Head; then they both &s;wore, they did not know which cut the mo&s;t droll Figure, I or my Dog.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>Tom,</HI> who&s;e Heart was divided be|tween Re&s;entment and Compa&s;&s;ion, prof|fered to lead the old Man; and imme|diately they &s;et forward, next Day at Noon, clo&s;e to a running Water, on a ri&s;ing green Spot, over&s;haded by &s;ome
<PB N="231" REF="251">wide &s;preading Oaks, that grew in the Hedge-row. At a Di&s;tance from the dirty Road, as they &s;at down to cool them&s;elves, <HI>Tom</HI> de&s;ired his Partner to tell him how he became blind.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;My Father was a Gardener, and brought me up to his own Bu&s;ine&s;s; but willing that I &s;hould improve my|&s;elf, he &s;ent me to an Acquaintance of his, of the &s;ame Bu&s;ine&s;s near <HI>London.</HI> Now, tho' I &s;ay it, few People of my Years (for I was, Sir, but Seventeen then) &s;trove harder for Knowledge than I did: I lov'd Work, and u&s;ed to buy or borrow every Book I could, concerning Plants and Gar|dening.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;God help me, I can't read now. But my Ma&s;ter and I could not a|gree; for he was a Man who loved his Plea&s;ures mightily, and kept the be&s;t Sort of Company, as he call'd it, in <HI>London</HI> at the Taverns; and in the Country at Hor&s;e-race Times. To be &s;ure I have &s;een very great Gentlemen come, and take him out with them; for he cou'd &s;ing very well, and tell a Heap of comical Sto|ries, and had always &s;omething to &s;ay for him&s;elf; yet he and I cou'd not agree. He laugh'd at me for
<PB N="232" REF="252">going to Church, and for reading the New Te&s;tament; and wou'd endea|vour to di&s;pute with me about it; but for all he was my Ma&s;ter in other Re|&s;pects, he was but a weak Arguer; &s;till he wou'd endeavour to laugh me out of my Religion; now I us'd to &endq;wonder at that, and tell him &s;o.</Q></P>

<P><Q>&startq;I went to work at <HI>Fulham;</HI> and over-again&s;t our Grounds, there liv'd a fine young Lady; &s;he had a Cha|riot,
<PB N="233" REF="253">and two Footmen; People &s;aid, indeed, &s;he was but a kept Mi&s;tre&s;s; that was none of my Bu&s;ine&s;s: She always paid us very generou&s;ly, and was a &s;pecial Cu&s;tomer. She us'd to walk in a Morning among us, when we were at Work, with a very gen|teel young Woman; one of the pret|tie&s;t &endq;Girls I ever &s;aw in my Life.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I lik'd this young Woman very much; &s;he was a Clergyman's Daugh|ter, and had been brought up very well, tho' &s;he was but a Servant then; I can't &s;ay &s;he was a Servant neither, for &endq;Mi&s;s <HI>Elms</HI> kept her as her Companion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;One day I broke my Mind to her; and after a Week, or two, &s;he gave me her Con&s;ent to be my Wife; pro|vided, that Mi&s;s <HI>Elms</HI> wou'd not be again&s;t it.&mdash;Now to &s;ee &s;ome La|dies Tempers, how fanta&s;tical they are&mdash;Mi&s;s <HI>Elms</HI> wou'd not give her Con&s;ent, till &s;he had &s;ome Talk with me, &s;he &s;aid. I waited upon her; and tho' I am &s;ure, when &s;he walk'd in our Gardens, if I had offer'd to touch her Hand, &s;he wou'd have &s;et me in the Stocks; yet now &s;he was mad, if I may &s;o call it, that I &s;hou'd fall in Love with her Maid, and &s;he by; and &s;he told, me &s;he in&s;i&s;ted,&mdash;
<PB N="234" REF="254">but Company coming in, &s;he di&s;|mi&s;s'd me; gave me a Guinea; and told me, to bring her a Carnation &endq;To-morrow at Twelve o'Clock.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I told Mi&s;s <HI>Wilt</HI> the Subject of what Mi&s;s <HI>Elms</HI> &s;aid. My Girl fell into Tears, and told me I &s;hou'd leave her; but I made her a &s;olemn Vow I wou'd not. She was not &s;atisfied; but made Mi&s;s <HI>Elms</HI>'s Gentleman jealous, as &s;he has often confe&s;s'd to me &s;ince: He found Mi&s;s <HI>Elms</HI> and me together, but as harmle&s;s as Si&s;|ter and Brother. However, he took me to Ta&s;k about it. I told him, I courted Mi&s;s <HI>Wilt,</HI> his Lady's Wait|ing-maid: He cou'd not believe it at fir&s;t; but to convince him, we were married at his Expence; and he gave us a Sum of Money, and &s;ent us down into the Country, according to &endq;both our De&s;ires.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I cho&s;e to go to the Pari&s;h where I was born, and there rented a Piece of Land. My Wife and I liv'd very happy together; we had two fine Children; Lord, how proud we were of them; how did we exult on tho&s;e fine Blo&s;&s;oms, as I may call them, of our own rai&s;ing; but we were wrong; we found it; for my poor Boy, who
<PB N="235" REF="255">was then twelve Years of Age, was &s;ent to the Squire's, our Landlord, with &s;ome Cherries; it was hot Wea|ther, the poor Boy was dry, and begged &s;ome &s;mall Beer. My Land|lord being within Hearing, pour'd a Bottle of old Beer into the Can, and gave it him: He was dry, he drank mo&s;t of it, it &s;oon got into his Head, he &s;ung, and danc'd, and played &s;e|veral mad Pranks; but this was fine Fun for the Squire, and &s;ome Vi&s;i|tors he had;&mdash;(ju&s;t &s;uch Brutes as hang'd my poor Dog)&mdash;to keep my poor Boy in Spirits, they pour'd &s;e|veral Drams down his Throat: Till at la&s;t, foaming at the Mouth, he tumbled upon the Floor; from whence he was carried into the Sta|ble, &endq;where in an Hour's Time he died.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;This Misfortune almo&s;t turned my poor Wife's Brain, and made me lit|tle better than a crazy Man; but the Squire, to make us Amends, gave us Money, &s;ent his Doctor to attend my dear Wife; nay, and his Si&s;ter came, and took her out in his Chariot, three Times a Week, to take the Air. In re|turn for the&s;e Civilities my Wife, who had a very grateful Heart, and willing that our Daughter, who was now
<PB N="236" REF="256">ju&s;t turn'd Fourteen, and a very lovely Girl, &s;hou'd &s;ee the world, let this Squire's Si&s;ter have her, as Mi&s;s <HI>Elms</HI> had my Wife for a Com|panion.&endq;</Q></P>

In Winter the Family went up to <HI>London,</HI> and we had &s;everal Letters, and little Pre&s;ents from my Daughter at fir&s;t; but in half a Year &s;he left off writing, and we never heard from her after|wards, till &s;he was in the Lock Ho&s;|pital. From thence &s;he &s;ent us Word, the Squire had got her with Child, and upon the Di&s;covery, his Si&s;ter turn'd her out of Doors. The Bro|ther &s;upported her till &s;he was deliver|ed, and then left her to the wide World; and about &s;even Months af|terwards, &s;he came into that Ho&s;pi|tal.&mdash;She begged for our Ble&s;&s;ing, and Forgivene&s;s; and in a Week after &endq;that died very penitent.</Q>&mdash;<HI>Oh my Daughter! my Daughter! I can't help crying, young Man &mdash; I can't help it.

Formerly the Per|&s;on who had the cleare&s;t Pipe was &s;ure to be cho&s;e.</P>
<P>One Man got it, only by giving the Church-wardens two Dozen of Franks.</P>
<P>Another, crammed all the Children with gilded Gingerbread, for four or five Days, before the Time of Chu&s;ing; and then they made &s;uch a Noi&s;e at Home, that their Parents, for Peace Sake, &s;poke ju&s;t as the Children wou'd have them.</P>
<P>One Man got it, by bringing down a <HI>Barbary</HI> Hor&s;e, and let him &s;erve the principle Peoples Mares <HI>gratis.</HI></P>
<PB N="241" REF="263">
<P>Another gain'd it, by Jappanning all the Farmers Wives <HI>Sunday</HI>'s Pumps, with the famous new-invented Liquid.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or had a Brother, who was a Dragoon, and he brought the mi|litary Man down to back his Preten&s;ions. The Soldier's Appearance &s;cared half the Country, to &s;ee his cro&s;s Buff Belts, his bright-barrell'd Carbine, his large-handled Sword, and his Cloak rowl'd up like a Collar of Brawn: And he hinted, that if his Brother had not the Place, he &s;hou'd &s;tay a Month, or two, among them; but the Place was given to his Brother at once, upon Condition that the Hor&s;e and Arms &s;hou'd appear there no more.</P>
<P>As the Village had been badly &s;erv'd, for a long Time pa&s;t, it was determin'd by a Majority at the Ve&s;try, that every Body &s;hou'd give their Opinion, without Fear or Favour.</P>
<P>The Morning <HI>Tom Fool,</HI> and his Part|ner came there, was the Time appointed to try the Merits of each Whi&s;tler. All the People of the Village were a&s;|&s;embled; a large Ring was made, and the &s;everal Performers were waiting in the Tythe Barn.</P>
<P>Silence was call'd out three Times, by the Beadle; and then upro&s;e one of
<PB N="242" REF="264">the olde&s;t Farmers in the Village, and thus deliver'd him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Neighbours, Fellow-farmers, Friends, and Engli&s;hmen; allow me to congra|tulate ye, on the Intent of this Day's Meeting. I rejoice to have liv'd to this Time, to &s;ee my Countrymen at Liber|ty, to &s;peak as they ought to do, without being bia&s;s'd, by either mean Tempta|tions, or mighty Threatnings. This Day we are met, to &s;peak as we think; and not to &s;ay, yes, or no, ju&s;t as the Market goes.</P>
<P>Let me beg you'll this Day act agree|ably to the Intention of this Meeting. Con&s;ider how our Crops have &s;uffer'd, by our former Whi&s;tlers. Have we not had &s;ome, who promi&s;ing faithfully to &s;erve us, yet have &s;old our Crops as they grew: But for that, only your&s;elves are to be blam'd; for as they might lay out all they had to buy the Place, they were right to make the Place get what it co&s;t them. Do ye not Neighbours chu&s;e a Man that has a &s;weet Tooth; for we know by Experience, when &s;ometimes we have had a diligent and &s;hrill Whi&s;t|ler, yet he has been tempted by Sweet|meats; and in&s;tead of Whi&s;tling, when the Pigeons have got into the Corn, he
<PB N="243" REF="265">has had his Mouth full of Sugar-plumbs, and cou'd not utter a &s;ingle Note.</P>
<P>Let not a Gentleman's Servant be your Whi&s;tler; for you may depend on't, they'll oblige the great Families, in Hopes of being provided for after Harve&s;t-time.</P>
<P>Chu&s;e not a Whi&s;tler that's fond of Sporting; he, in&s;tead of watching the Grain, will get to Cob-&s;tone under a Hedge, or at Nine-men's-morrice, or el&s;e leave the Fields, and run a Squirrel-hunting;&mdash;but the Day begins to wa&s;te, I'll keep you no longer from your Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, but may Providence direct you for the be&s;t.</P>
<P>The Whi&s;tlers enter'd, but not one of them came up to the Pari&s;hioners Ex|pectations. At la&s;t, <HI>Tom Fool,</HI> who had overheard all that had been &s;aid and performed, as he &s;tood at the Back of the Ring, gave &s;o &s;hrill a Whi&s;tle, he pierced their Ears, and they all turn'd their Heads, to know where the Sound came from.</P>
<P>He was plac'd in the Ring, where he exhibited &s;o much to their Satisfactions, and in the Account he gave of him&s;elf, was &s;o mode&s;t, that they cho&s;e him Whi&s;tler on the Spot: But this Office <HI>Tom</HI> wou'd not accept of, unle&s;s he might have Liberty he told them, to take Care
<PB N="244" REF="266">of that old Man, he had brought with him.</P>
<P>This Humanity gave the Pari&s;h a good Opinion of <HI>Tom</HI>'s Principles; they made a Collection for young <HI>Fool</HI>'s blind Friend on the Spot. <HI>Tom</HI> was &s;hown to a Ho|vel, where he might always retire to in tempe&s;tuous Weather: And he that Day got the old Man &s;ettled, and the next he enter'd upon his Office; in which he ac|quitted him&s;elf to the entire Satisfaction of the Inhabitants.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>IT is incredible, what an Alteration the Pari&s;hioners found in their Com|mon, by harve&s;t Time; not a Bird dared to &s;ettle among them. Nay, <HI>Tom Fool</HI> put up all Sorts of Traps, to de|&s;troy Vermin; and he was always either Whi&s;tling, or Weeding, or driving &s;tray'd Cattle off.</P>
<P>Within three Miles where <HI>Tom</HI> kept Watch, liv'd Lady <HI>Green&s;y.</HI> She kept the large&s;t Dove-coat in the Country. After <HI>Tom</HI> had been &s;ome Time in his Po&s;t, &s;he ob&s;erv'd her Pigeons kept more at Home than u&s;ual; they did not &s;eem inclinable to &s;tir out of the Yard, as if they dreaded the Kite. She enquir'd among the Servants what cou'd be the Meaning of this: They told her Lady|&s;hip, the new Whi&s;tler had &s;car'd them off; and he was &s;uch a cro&s;s Curr, he wou'd neither let Birds, nor Bea&s;ts, come near him.</P>
<P>She order'd her Po&s;tillion to go and thra&s;h the Fellow; but <HI>Tom</HI> thra&s;h'd the Po&s;tillion: She then order'd her Maids, as they went to and from milking, to
<PB N="246" REF="268">decoy him to walk with them; and &s;he promis'd that Girl that cou'd get him away from his Po&s;t a new Gown, de&s;igning then to accu&s;e him to the Pari&s;h for Negligence, and get one of her own People put in his Place.</P>
<P><HI>Tom</HI> indeed wou'd chat with the Girls, but never &s;tir from his Po&s;t. Lady <HI>Green&s;y</HI> was piqued; it was now high Harve&s;t, and fine picking for her Pige|ons; &s;he therefore &s;ent two Half-crowns to <HI>Tom</HI> to drink her Health; and in re|turn, only begg'd he'd let her Pigeons feed ju&s;t five Minutes. <HI>Tom</HI> &s;ent the Money back, and hop'd her Lady&s;hip wou'd excu&s;e him; but if &s;he'd give him a Crown a-piece for every Pigeon, he wou'd not do it.</P>
<P><HI>Will,</HI> the Game-keeper, brought <HI>Tom</HI>'s An&s;wer back; and according to Cu&s;tom inform'd his Fellow-&s;ervants of it, be|fore he deliver'd his Me&s;&s;age to the Lady. As &s;oon as they head it, they &s;et up &s;uch a Shout; bawling out, a Fool! a Fool! a Fool indeed. The Cry was heard by Lady <HI>Green&s;y,</HI> who happen'd at that Time to be in the Library, li&s;tning to her Chaplain's Definition of a Fool, or Ideot.</P>
<PB N="247" REF="269">
<P>Hearing the Word Fool repeated &s;o plain and forcibly, &s;he begg'd Mr. Rec|tor wou'd ha&s;ten into the Hall, for Heaven's Sake, and enquire if they really had got a Fool among them; for a Fool, &s;he told the Chaplain, of all Creatures, was what &s;he mo&s;t long'd to be acquaint|ed with.</P>
<P>Down Stairs he de&s;cended, promi&s;ing her Lady&s;hip, that he wou'd demand a categorical Rea&s;on, for the in&s;tantaneous Vociferation of her Lady&s;hip's Dome|&s;ticks. To amu&s;e her&s;elf till his Return, &s;he retired into her Cordial Clo&s;et.</P>
<P>To amu&s;e the Reader, during the mo|mentous Ce&s;&s;ation of this active Hi&s;|tory, he &s;hall be inform'd who Lady <HI>Green&s;y</HI> was, and the Rea&s;on of her extra|ordinary Curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>Her maiden Name was <HI>Trolly,</HI> and &s;he was taken from Boarding-&s;chool at fourteen Years of Age, to be married to Alderman <HI>Chedder,</HI> the great Chee&s;e Factor, Aetat. 59. He was a very in|dulgent Hu&s;band to her, but yet &s;he begg'd &s;everal Times, before they had been married a Twelvemonth, to be car|ried to the Boarding-&s;chool again.</P>
<P>To amu&s;e her, he took her to his E&s;tate in <HI>Wales,</HI> and there &s;he diverted
<PB N="248" REF="270">her&s;elf with catching Butterflies, build|ing Baby-hou&s;es, and playing at Battle|dore and Shuttlecock.</P>
<P>Her Spou&s;e left off Trade entirely, and liv'd wholly with his young Wife: But want of Employment, or Change of Air, or <HI>Welch</HI> Ale, or catching Cold, or &s;omething or another, (for Phy&s;icians are not always clear in their account|ing for the Origin of Di&s;tempers) he grew drop&s;ical, and died in three Years after his Marriage; leaving Ma|dam <HI>Chedder,</HI> a young, hand&s;ome, weal|thy Widow.</P>
<P>At her return to <HI>London,</HI> &s;he grew pen&s;ive; often &s;ighing, for fear &s;he &s;hou'd be oblig'd to leave all her Riches to Strangers. She wi&s;h'd &s;he had a Child of her own, but was determined not to marry in a Hurry; &s;uch Stories &s;he had heard of Fortune-hunters. But then, to have one without marrying? The Sin, and the Shame of that.&mdash;It happen'd &s;oon after her return to <HI>London,</HI> that &s;he took particular Notice, at a City Fea&s;t, of a Gentleman, who was a very jolly, hone&s;t Fellow. He &s;ung &s;everal Songs, told &s;everal Stories, play'd a great many Tricks, and was indeed the Life, Soul, and Fiddle of the Company.</P>
<PB N="249" REF="271">
<P>That Evening an Appointment was made, and &s;he con&s;ented to come in cog. and breakfa&s;t with him the next Day.</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible among jolly Fellows, to keep any thing good to them&s;elves. That very Night, he found out a Set of his Particulars, to whom he communi|cated his good Fortune.</P>
<P>Bumpers went about to his Succe&s;s; he drank her Health, in half a Dozen half Pints; and about Seven in the Morning, the Chairman, by the Help of his Servant, dragg'd him up Stairs: And he was laid acro&s;s the Bed, in that State of Stupefaction, &s;pecified un|der the Article, dead Drunk.&mdash;</P>
<P>Madam <HI>Chedder</HI> lay awake mo&s;t Part of the Night, reflecting on the agree|able Tete a Tete &s;he &s;hou'd enjoy next Morning; and having, as &s;he was or|der'd, been call'd up at Seven; and put|ting on one of her Servant's Gowns and Cloaks, ha&s;ted to the Rende&s;vous.</P>
<P>But judge her Surpri&s;e, when &s;he &s;aw her <HI>Adonis,</HI> with his Cloaths half torn off his Back, his Face and Hands cover'd with Mud, his Stockings about his Heels, his Cheeks brui&s;ed, Lips cut, and no Sign of Life in him, but what a
<PB N="250" REF="272">deep Snore, now and then i&s;&s;uing from his unclean No&s;trils, indicated.</P>
<P>Piqued to Death &s;he left him, deter|mined within her&s;elf to de&s;pi&s;e all Man|kind.</P>
<P>But Sir <HI>Pan&s;y Green&s;y,</HI> the Week fol|lowing, prevented her from being deter|minate in her Re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Green&s;y</HI> was really a fine Gentle|man, delicate in his Dre&s;s, delicate in his Complection, delicate in his Speech; in a Word, he was immen&s;ely delicate. He was ju&s;t return'd from the grand Tour; and all his Acquaintance, Depen|dants, and Tutors, pronounced him a fini&s;h'd Character. When Madam <HI>Ched|der</HI> gave him her Hand, he was ju&s;t turned twenty-&s;even Years of Age. But the Debaucheries of <HI>London, Leghorn, Paris,</HI> &amp;c. had rendered the Baronet impotent. The Wedding indeed was celebrated with the utmo&s;t Magnificence, wou'd we cou'd &s;ay it was &s;olemnis'd, as much to the Satisfaction of the Lady&mdash;no&mdash;his Title &s;he wedded, his Title only &s;he en|joyed. At his Decea&s;e, which happen|ed in about eighteen Months, after her being nominally married to him, (as &s;he u&s;ed to call it) &s;he retired into the Country, an ab&s;olute Man-hater; like
<PB N="251" REF="273">an innocent Countryman, who, having been trick'd by one, or two, of the peddling <HI>Jews,</HI> &s;wears the whole <HI>Hebrew</HI> Nation are Cheats.</P>
<P>The very Evening before <HI>Tom</HI> had the two half Crowns &s;ent him, &s;he had been at a neighbouring Lady's Hou&s;e, upon a Chri&s;tening Vi&s;it. It is com|mon, when Ship-ma&s;ters meet together, to talk about Sailing; when Players get together they &s;peak Tragedy Speeches; and when Go&s;&s;ips pu&s;h the Cawdle-bowl about, the Conver&s;ation is always on the Occa&s;ion that brought them together.</P>
<P>At this Convivial, Lady <HI>Green&s;y</HI> heard two elderly Ladies expatiate upon Ideots and Fools; and what &s;urprizing Crea|tures they were; and told &s;uch Stories of them, as to their own Knowledge, they prote&s;ted were true; that my Lady <HI>Green&s;y</HI> vowed a Secret, but fervent Vow, that if Money cou'd purcha&s;e a Fool, &s;he wou'd not be without one. It was on that Subject &s;he was que&s;tioning her Chaplain, when her Servants open'd in full Cry, as before-mentioned.</P>
<P>Upon the Chaplain's Return, &s;he de|manded eagerly, <HI>Is there a Fool below?</HI></P>
<P><HI>"Not identically my Lady"</HI> (the good Man replied) <HI>the Clamour among the Me|nials
<PB N="252" REF="274">aro&s;e from the Folly of that poor Crea|ture, who is hired by the Pari&s;h, as a Scare-crow. He has &s;ent back the Money your Lady&s;hip ordered&mdash;Yet let me &s;up|plicate your Lady&s;hip, not to take it in Di&s;|dain.</HI></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but Mr. Rector, is he really a Fool? An Ideot?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rector.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Does he not de&s;pi&s;e Money? Has he not refu&s;ed your Lady&s;hip's Pre&s;ent? But let me deprecate your Anger, be not accelerate in your Revenge upon &s;uch a Reptile.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But yet, Sir, you have not convinced me, that he is really a Fool.</P>

<P>If your Lady&s;hip will permit me, I will ab&s;tractedly demon&s;trate, that he is an Ideot; and thus I form my Syl|logi&s;m.&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<P>Lady <HI>Green&s;y</HI> wou'd not attend the Con&s;equence; but, ordering the Game|keeper to attend her, &s;he was re&s;olved to
<PB N="253" REF="275">be &s;atisfied, by talking to the Fellow her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. Rector proffer'd his Service to attend her, but &s;he politely refu&s;ed him; hinting, at the &s;ame Time, that his Pre|&s;ence might be more nece&s;&s;ary, in look|ing after the Haunch of Veni&s;on.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXX.</HEAD>
<P>LADY <HI>Green&s;y</HI> &s;oon met with <HI>Tom Fool;</HI>&mdash;&s;hee a&s;ked him &s;everal Que&s;|tions, and very critically &s;urveyed his Figure. She liked his Replies immen&s;e|ly, and va&s;tly admired his Complection. Then &s;he began to enquire very particu|larly into <HI>Tom Fool</HI>'s bringing up; and &s;ent the Game-keeper back, with Or|ders not to have Dinner &s;erved up till Four o'Clock.</P>
<P>But as &s;he was conver&s;ing with <HI>Tom,</HI> the Sky began to lour, the Rain fell, the Wind blew, and Black and all Black look'd the South Horizon.</P>
<P>She was forced to retreat into the Ho|vel for Shelter; and young <HI>Fool</HI> with her.</P>
<P>Thus we read, in a Book of the Ro|man Hi&s;tory, how <HI>Aeneas</HI> Captain of a Privateer, and Widow <HI>Dido,</HI> the Bridle|cutter, &s;ecreted them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The Turret Clock &s;truck Four, the Sauces were pour'd out, and the Fi&s;h drain'd, the Veni&s;on Paper &s;corch'd, the Cook &s;wearing, the Chaplain fretting, her Lady&s;hip's Servants di&s;patched &s;e|veral Ways, to &s;ee that no Mi&s;chief had befallen her.</P>
<P>But in the mid&s;t of this Di&s;traction, Lady <HI>Green&s;y</HI> appeared in Sight, walking
<PB N="255" REF="277">coolly up the Terrace, leading <HI>Tom Fool</HI> in her Hand; and immediately ordered the Steward to dre&s;s <HI>Tom Fool</HI> in &s;ome of her late Hu&s;hand's Cloaths, and let him and Dinner be brought up together.</P>
<P>With what Remarks this was execu|ted by the Servants, is beneath the Dig|nity of an Hi&s;torian to relate.&mdash;But when Mr. <HI>Fool</HI> appear'd in her Lady&s;hip's Sight, clean and fine dre&s;s'd, &s;he cou'd not help turning to her Woman, and, in a half Whi&s;per, break out,&mdash;<HI>Su&s;an, pon Onner he's an Angel.</HI> The Chaplain was ordered to attend, and marry her and young <HI>Fool</HI> immediately.</P>
<P>The good Man was under great Sur|prize, he had entertain'd &s;ome di&s;tant Hopes, of being inducted into that Pre|ferment him&s;elf; but it was over; &s;he was deaf to Expo&s;tulations.&mdash;She wou'd be obey'd; and the Wedding was that Night celebrated.</P>
<P>Her Lady&s;hip's Opinion concerning Mankind (as <HI>Su&s;an</HI> a Day or two after|wards pre&s;umed to enquire) was alter'd; the Lady very graciou&s;ly acknowledg'd; but yet to her Dying-day &s;he in&s;i&s;ted on it; <HI>That no Man was worth marrying but a Fool.</HI></P>
