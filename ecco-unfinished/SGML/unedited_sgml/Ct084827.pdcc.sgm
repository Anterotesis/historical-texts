<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN fir&s;t I began the fol|lowing <HI>Poem,</HI> I was &s;o far from thinking of the Pre&s;s; that I aimed no farther than to de|&s;cribe, and that for my own Diver|&s;ion only, The <HI>Monomachie,</HI> or <HI>Sin|gle Combat,</HI> between the <HI>Giant</HI> and the <HI>Stripling,</HI> great <HI>Goliah</HI> and lit|tle <HI>David</HI>.</P>
<P>After I had, in &s;uch Sort as it is, performed that, I was drawn on, in|&s;en&s;ibly as it were, to &s;et forth the <HI>Noble Friend&s;hip,</HI> which, upon the great <HI>Atchievement</HI> of <HI>David</HI>'s, was
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
contracted between <HI>Prince Jonathan</HI> and <HI>Him:</HI> with the <HI>Effects</HI> of both, the <HI>Advancement</HI> of <HI>David</HI> to <HI>Places</HI> of <HI>Honour, Tru&s;t</HI> and <HI>Power,</HI> and his <HI>brave di&s;charge</HI> thereof, in the <HI>Service</HI> of his <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Country</HI>. Which, as it gained him the great <HI>Love</HI> of the <HI>People,</HI> &s;o it procur'd him the high <HI>Di&s;plea&s;ure</HI> of the <HI>King:</HI> and, as Con&s;equent thereof, the <HI>Trou|bles</HI> he afterwards went through.</P>
<P>Having attended him &s;o far in his <HI>Pro&s;perity</HI> and <HI>Greatne&s;s,</HI> I could not find in my Heart, methought, to leave him in his <HI>Adver&s;ity</HI> and <HI>de|pre&s;&s;ed State:</HI> but accompanying him through his <HI>Sufferings</HI> under <HI>Saul,</HI> I waited on him, till I had &s;een him fairly &s;ettled on the Throne of <HI>I&s;rael</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4">There again I made a Stand, as willing to have made that the <HI>Bound</HI> of my <HI>Undertaking</HI>. But after I had paus'd awhile, look'd back, and view'd the Steps I had taken; ob|&s;erv'd from what a <HI>low Beginning,</HI> through what extream <HI>Difficulties</HI> and <HI>Hard&s;hips,</HI> to what a <HI>towring Pitch</HI> of <HI>Height</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> our <HI>Hero</HI> was advanced: and con&s;idered al&s;o, how &s;oon this Great and Mighty <HI>Mo|narch,</HI> this Excellent <HI>Man, through a &s;uddain</HI> Temptation <HI>of</HI> Lu&s;t, ex|cited by the alluring Bait <HI>of</HI> Beauty, fell into tho&s;e gro&s;s and hainous Sins of <HI>Adultery</HI> and <HI>Murther;</HI> I could not forbear to <HI>di&s;play</HI> that Part of his <HI>Life</HI> al&s;o, as fore&s;eeing there might &s;ome u&s;eful <HI>Remarks</HI> be made thereon, which might be of Service
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
to <HI>caution</HI> others. Wherefore, run|ning ha&s;tily over the former Part of his Reign, and but lightly touching, in a general way, his <HI>Wars</HI> and <HI>Mar|tial Enterprizes;</HI> I entred, as dire|ctly as I well could, upon the <HI>foul Story</HI> of <HI>fair BATH-SHEBA:</HI> and, as con&s;equent thereof, the contrived Death <HI>of her</HI> abu&s;ed Husband, the <HI>brave</HI> and <HI>valiant URIAH</HI>. Which, with the <HI>better Account</HI> of <HI>David</HI>'s eminent <HI>Sorrow</HI> for it, <HI>Repentance</HI> of it, <HI>Recovery</HI> from it, and <HI>Re&s;to|ration</HI> to the <HI>Favour</HI> of <HI>God</HI> again, clo&s;es the <HI>Third Book</HI>.</P>
<P>There, indeed, I was forc'd to make another <HI>Stop;</HI> which I thought would have proved a <HI>full Stop:</HI> for it la&s;t|ed more than <HI>Twenty Years</HI>. The
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
<HI>Poem</HI> was begun, and &s;o far carried on (Excepting only the <HI>Fir&s;t Chap|ter</HI> of the <HI>Fir&s;t Book)</HI> in the Year <HI>1688.</HI> When <HI>The Prince of Orange</HI> landing, and the <HI>Nation</HI> being in <HI>Arms;</HI> the <HI>Noi&s;e</HI> of <HI>Guns,</HI> and <HI>Sounds</HI> of <HI>Drums</HI> and <HI>Trumpets</HI> &s;o affrighted, and di&s;turbed my <HI>peace|ful Mu&s;e,</HI> that both <HI>She,</HI> for a while, for &s;ook me, and <HI>I</HI> thereupon the Work. Save that, upon a <HI>Review,</HI> &s;ome time after, ob&s;erving how abruptly <HI>David</HI> was brought in: that he might not look like one of the <HI>Knights Errand</HI> of Old, ru&s;hing into a <HI>Fray</HI> with his <HI>Beavor</HI> down, that none could know either who he was, or whence he came, I added the <HI>Fir&s;t Chapter;</HI> thereby beginning the <HI>Story</HI> a little
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
higher, that I might introduce my <HI>Hero</HI> with &s;omewhat the more Ad|vantage.</P>
<P>There it re&s;ted, without any Pro|&s;pect of its ever going further, until the last Winter. When, having le&s;s <HI>Health,</HI> and more <HI>Lei&s;ure,</HI> than at &s;ome times before; I took it up, for an <HI>Entertainment,</HI> to make &s;ome <HI>un|ea&s;ie Hours</HI> pa&s;s &s;omewhat le&s;s unea|&s;ily over. And after I had read it through, con&s;idering with my &s;elf, that if, after my Death, being found amongst my loo&s;e Papers, it &s;hould be committed to the <HI>Pre&s;s;</HI> it could pa&s;s for, at be&s;t but an <HI>imperfect,</HI> or <HI>unfini&s;h'd Piece:</HI> I found an In|clination of Mind, to carry on the <HI>Story,</HI> if I could, to the <HI>End</HI> of
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
<HI>David</HI>'s <HI>Life</HI>. Wherefore giving a kind <HI>Invitation</HI> to my <HI>gentle Mu&s;e</HI> to return (who, by &s;ome &s;hort <HI>Vi&s;its,</HI> on <HI>particular</HI> Occa&s;ions, in the <HI>Interval,</HI> had given me &s;ome Ground to hope, &s;he had not quite abandoned me) I entred again upon the <HI>Subject,</HI> where I had left off; and by Degrees went through it, till I had brought my <HI>warlike Hero</HI> to his <HI>peaceful Grave</HI>.</P>
<P>After it was fini&s;hed, deliberating about the <HI>Publi&s;hing</HI> of it; as whe|ther to <HI>Publi&s;h</HI> it <HI>my &s;elf,</HI> or leave it, as a <HI>Po&s;thume,</HI> to be <HI>publi&s;hed</HI> (if thought fit) by &s;ome <HI>kind</HI> Hand, after my Death: the <HI>Rea&s;ons,</HI> which turn'd the <HI>Ballance</HI> for <HI>pre&s;ent Print|ing</HI> were; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> that, at pre&s;ent the <HI>Pre&s;s</HI> is open: which po&s;&s;ibly may
<PB N="x" REF="9">
hereafter be &s;hut. And <HI>Secondly,</HI> That if, upon the <HI>Publication</HI> of it, <HI>MOMUS</HI> &s;hould <HI>Carp</HI> (which he is but too apt to do, even where there is le&s;s Occa&s;ion for it) I might be at hand, ready my &s;elf to <HI>An&s;wer</HI> his <HI>Cavils;</HI> who, if any Cau&s;e be given for them, gave it: though a&s;&s;uredly without any Intention &s;o to do.</P>
<P>Till I had wholly fini&s;hed, and tran&s;cribed al&s;o, this <HI>Poem;</HI> I had not had the Opportunity of peru&s;ing the Learned <HI>COWLEY</HI>'s <HI>DAVIDEIS;</HI> though I had heard of it, and, I think, had once a tran&s;ient Sight of it, before I began this. Since I have read it through, with my be&s;t Attention: and am very well pleas'd, that I had not read it before: le&s;t his great
<PB N="xi" REF="10">
<HI>Name,</HI> high <HI>Stile,</HI> and lofty <HI>Fancy</HI> &s;hould have led me, though unawares, into an <HI>api&s;h Imitation</HI> of them; which doubtle&s;s would have look'd very <HI>odly,</HI> and <HI>ill</HI> in me, how <HI>admi|rable</HI> &s;oever in him.</P>
<P>His Aim and mine differ widely: the <HI>Method</HI> of each no le&s;s. <HI>He</HI> wrote for the <HI>Learned;</HI> and tho&s;e too of the <HI>Upper Form:</HI> and his <HI>Flights</HI> are an&s;werable. <HI>I</HI> write for common <HI>Readers;</HI> in a Stile familiar, and ea&s;ie to be under&s;tood by &s;uch. <HI>His</HI> would have needed (if he had not ad|ded it) a large <HI>Paraphra&s;e</HI> upon it; to <HI>Explain</HI> the many <HI>difficult Pa&s;&s;ages</HI> in it. <HI>Mine,</HI> as it has none, will not, I hope, need any.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="11">I have the &s;ame <HI>Aim</HI> in this, the &s;ame <HI>Inducement</HI> to it, as I had in writing the <HI>Sacred Hi&s;tory</HI> of both the <HI>Old</HI> and the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> viz. To invite, and endeavour to draw all, the <HI>Youth</HI> e&s;pecially, of either <HI>Sex,</HI> to improve their <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Studies;</HI> by imploying both in reading <HI>better Books,</HI> written on <HI>better Subjects,</HI> than <HI>too many</HI> of them <HI>too often</HI> do.</P>
<P>I am not &s;o wholly a <HI>Stranger</HI> to the <HI>Writings</HI> of the mo&s;t <HI>Celebrated Poets,</HI> as well <HI>Antient</HI> as <HI>Modern,</HI> as not to know, that the great <HI>Em|belli&s;hments</HI> of their <HI>Poems</HI> con&s;i&s;t mo&s;tly in their <HI>extravagant,</HI> and al|mo&s;t <HI>boundle&s;s Fancies; Amazing,</HI> and even <HI>Dazeling Flights; Luxu|rious Inventions; Wild Hyper|ble's;

<P>In a Word, I am not &s;o <HI>vain to &s;eek</HI> Applau&s;e: I don't expect to be commended.

I don't affect the <HI>Title</HI> of <HI>Poet</HI>. Let 'em call me, in that re|&s;pect, what they plea&s;e.

not. <HI>I</HI> am more <HI>mode&s;t,</HI> than to ex|pect Admi&s;&s;ion amongst the <HI>be&s;t</HI> Po|ets: and yet think it a little below me to be Ranked with the <HI>very wor&s;t Nec Suffaenus &s;um, nec in&s;cribe Praxitelem</HI>.
