<LG>
<L>OUR bard and I were ju&s;t about to fight,</L>
<L>When he con&s;ented you &s;hould &s;et us right.</L>
<L>He &s;ays "he's nervous&mdash;nought can cool his fever,</L>
<L>"The town won't bear &s;uch trivial &s;cenes for ever.</L>
<L>"The times are chang'd&mdash;&s;ententious draughts they quaff,</L>
<L>"And all is non&s;en&s;e now that makes them laugh.</L>
<L>"Morals from Seneca have gain'd $he day,</L>
<L>"And poor Joe Miller's je&s;ts have died away.</L>
<L>"What then becomes of him, &s;ince Joe's no more?</L>
<L>"He never dealt in &s;entimental lore.</L>
<L>"In modern novels tortur'd virtue's fame,</L>
<L>"Or "from the &s;ame" wrote letters "to the &s;ame."</L>
<L>"Would that he had!&mdash;fine words gain approbation;</L>
<L>"But if you laugh not&mdash;where's our Speculation?"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My an&s;wer was&mdash;" Sir Criticize may &s;wear,</L>
<L>"You ought not to be pleas'd, when mo&s;t you are.</L>
<L>"Say, that's ob&s;cure!&mdash;he under&s;tands not, this&mdash;</L>
<L>"But pray&mdash;is that the author's fault or his?</L>
<L>"May call that pantomime in which a &s;cene,</L>
<L>"Too much embelli&s;h'd by a chair or &s;kreen&mdash;</L>
<L>"For ah! how oft when hackney'd logic tires,</L>
<L>"Would Ranger's ladder rou&s;e your latent fires?</L>
<L>"And one broad laugh rais'd by &s;atyric Foote,</L>
<L>"Has done more good than noveli&s;t e'er wrote.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The comic mu&s;e was born to la&s;h mankind,</L>
<L>Not by fal&s;e &s;entiment debauch the mind.</L>
<L>What villain trembles at grave Plato's name?</L>
<L>But Horace' &s;atyr laughs him into &s;hame!</L>
<L>Lecture the proud&mdash;will preaching make them humble?</L>
<L>No&mdash;but lampoon them and their pride will tumble!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All this I told our bard, but &s;till he &s;igh'd,</L>
<L>Still urg'd his former doctrines, mine denied&mdash;</L>
<L>At length he &s;aid that you &s;hould &s;ettle all,</L>
<L>And by your &s;entence, he mu&s;t &s;tand or fall!</L>

<SPEAKER>CECILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>SO, nobody being near, I'll make u&s;e of the at|tendant's key, and for the &s;econd time conver&s;e with my dear Emmeline. We were ye&s;terday in|terrupted by Sir Frederick, and I had only time to &s;ay a few words to my old friend and &s;chool-fellow, but now&mdash;how! Sir Frederick again!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Sir</HI> FREDERICK FAINTLY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cecil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I beg I may not be thus con&s;tantly di&s;turb'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Fred.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Di&s;turb'd! I would reque&s;t the &s;ame favour, Mi&s;s Cecilia, but that nothing on earth ever di&s;turbs me; and indeed nothing ever plea&s;es me&mdash;I'm in a perfect &s;tate of happy <HI>nonchalance</HI>&mdash;I fancy though we're both on the &s;ame errand&mdash;that door, heh?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cecil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I told you ye&s;terday, &s;ir, I know nothing about that door.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Fred.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, for &s;hame!&mdash;what! do you pre|tend not to know that it leads to that part of the
<PB N="2" REF="5">hou&s;e where Emmeline is lock'd up? come, come, Mi&s;s&mdash;you remember I caught you bribing the at|tendant to lend you the key&mdash; <STAGE><HI>(Cecilia walks about in agitation)</HI></STAGE> now why be affronted? nothing ever affronts me&mdash;no, if you were a man, and cho&s;e to &s;ay I had cau&s;ed all Emmeline's &s;ufferings&mdash;that I had behaved like a ra&s;cal to her&mdash;then &s;end me a challenge&mdash;then cane&mdash;then kick me&mdash;why, I &s;houldn't be affronted&mdash;no, I've too much good breeding and good temper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cecil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Very likely, &s;ir; but as a vi&s;itor at Mr. Project's hou&s;e here in the country, I pry into no family &s;ecrets&mdash;if I did, I believe the &s;tory of this young lady&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Fred.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, poor girl! &s;he and all her large fortune had been mine if &s;he hadn't&mdash;you under|&s;tand &mdash;love touch'd her brain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cecil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How do you mean, &s;ir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Fred.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, that's the cau&s;e of her pre&s;ent confinement: to be &s;ure &s;he has lately recovered her &s;en&s;es&mdash;indeed is quite re&s;tored; but her guar|dian and phy&s;ician think her entering too &s;uddenly on the world again might occa&s;ion a relap&s;e&mdash;there|fore &s;he is kept quiet and clo&s;e in that part of the hou&s;e&mdash;Would you believe it, ma'am, &s;he preferr'd another man to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cecil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! and who could be &s;o accompli&s;h'd as to out-rival a lover like &s;ir Frederick?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Fred.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A cou&s;in of hers, one Captain Arable, who&s;e father, being aver&s;e to the match, &s;ent him to Gibraltar, where ever &s;ince&mdash;</P>

<STAGE><HI>Enter a</HI> Servant.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Serv.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, Lady Project de&s;ires to &s;ee you imme|diately.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cecil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There now&mdash;you need not be mortified&mdash;
<PB N="3" REF="6">there's your equivalent: I'm &s;ure her lady&s;hip pre|fers you to another man, even to her hu&s;band.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Fred.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>She does, &s;o &s;hew me to her. Mi&s;s, if you &s;hould get a peep at Emmeline, tell her as I'm always in love in the country&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cecil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>In the country! Why not in London?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Fred.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, that depends on the part of the town I'm in&mdash;I con&s;tantly adapt my&s;elf, and in every &s;treet I'm a different man&mdash;for in&s;tance now: in the Temple I'm a lawyer; in St. James's &s;treet a lounger; in St. George's church I'm a married man; in Doctors' Commons a bachelor; Guildhall gives me an appetite: the Alley makes me waddle; in the Squares I'm not worth a farthing; and in Lombard &s;treet I've as many plumbs as a banker&mdash; So tell Emmeline I &s;till love her and will &s;till be her hu&s;band.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Exit.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cecil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Now then for my charming reclu&s;e&mdash; <STAGE><HI>(Opens a door in flat.)</HI></STAGE> Emmeline, it is your friend Cecilia!</P>
<STAGE><HI>She leads in</HI> Emmeline.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Emme.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, forgive me, 'tis &s;o long &s;ince I have &s;een a friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cecil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Come, as we were interrupted ye&s;terday, pray &s;it down and proceed with your &s;tory: the little I have heard makes me anxious to hear more&mdash; <STAGE><HI>(They &s;it.)</HI></STAGE>&mdash;now, my &s;weet friend, proceed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Emme.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I will when I am able&mdash;Fir&s;t then, did you ever hear the name of Edward Ara&mdash;? you &s;ee my weakne&s;s; I have not power to proceed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cecil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, nay; unbo&s;om your feelings: pray go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Emme.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I will, I will&mdash;the name of Edward Arable &mdash;it is enough to &s;ay we lov'd and were divided&mdash; My father cho&s;e Sir Frederick for my hu&s;band, and on the morn of our intended marriage, they fal&s;ely told me Edward was no more. What was to
<PB N="4" REF="7">be done? my lover dead! about to be united to his rival! my health long worn by grief and di&s;|appointment! Oh my friend! I had not &s;trength to combat again&s;t &s;uch complicated mi&s;ery: a fever feiz'd me; my harra&s;s'd brain was heated to deli|rium, and merciful forgetfulne&s;s gave me that com|fort, my friends and father had denied me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cecil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Emmeline! and during your malady your father died.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Emme.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>He did, bequeathing me his whole for|tune in ca&s;e of recovery, and appointing Mr. Project my guardian. Now mark what follows: two months ago the phy&s;ician, who had the care of me, proclaim'd my health re&s;tor'd, and I came to this hou&s;e in the full hope of taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my for|tune, and &s;haring it with the man who be&s;t de&s;erves it&mdash;but what is the rever&s;e? I am confin'd to tho&s;e rooms; not &s;uffer'd to be &s;een or &s;poken to; my letters intercepted and de&s;troy'd, and when I a&s;k the rea&s;on for all this, they &s;ay, <Q>Your health's pre|carious, &startq;it requires peace and quiet, and if you mix too &s;uddenly with the world the joy may &endq;occa&s;ion a relap&s;e</Q>&mdash;the joy! What joy, my friend? What plea&s;ure can there be in mixing with that world that hitherto has only robbed me of my &s;en&s;es, and thwarted me in my affections?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cecil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>True, Emmeline; and now I &s;ee the mo|tive for your guardian's conduct&mdash;He is an enter-prizing man&mdash;has involv'd your fortune in his &s;chemes; and at pre&s;ent not being able to give you a fair account, he keeps you clo&s;e, till by &s;ome lucky &s;peculation he is enabled to repay you&mdash;but is there no way to extricate you? no means of e&s;caping?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Emme.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>None; impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cecil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have contrived to unlock one door in your
<PB N="5" REF="8">room, you &s;ee; why can't I get the key of the other?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Emme.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e it leads to a pagoda that adjoins the hou&s;e, and which has not been opened &s;ince my confinement. Oh Cecilia! is it not hard to wake as from a long and frightful dream, and find all true? no cheering friend to di&s;&s;ipate your terrors? nay, even he who&s;e very &s;miles would clear the clouds around me! he to be ab&s;ent! he not near to &s;oothe me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cecil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>He knows not of your recovery&mdash;your let|ters have not reach'd him, el&s;e&mdash;hu&s;h! &s;ome|body's coming! <STAGE><HI>(Looks out.)</HI></STAGE> it is your guardian! I cannot leave you &s;o un&s;atisfied&mdash;let me go with you&mdash;we'll plan &s;ome letters that may recal his &s;en|&s;ibility&mdash;his heart was once humane; and had he not ruin'd him&s;elf by living beyond his income&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Emme.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! there's the fountain of all modern evil! when once a man exceeds the limits of his fortune, the barrier of honour as well as prudence is thrown down&mdash;money is borrowed never to be re|pai&mdash;friends are dup'd and become enemies&mdash;the gaming table is flown to as a la&s;t effort&mdash;till imper|ceptibly, &s;tep by &s;tep, the mind, originally virtuous, becomes de&s;perate, harden'd, and unprincipled! and for the&s;e errors I am doom'd to &s;uffer! but he's here&mdash;Oh my father! why was I left to be the &s;a|crifice of another's di&s;&s;ipation and extravagance?</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Project.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you, go directly to Port&s;mouth; take my own carriage and hor&s;es, and, when the packet arrives from the Ea&s;t Indies, a&s;k for Mr.
<PB N="6" REF="9">Tanjore, and give him this letter&mdash;&s;top, let me read it once more.&mdash;</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>&startq;<HI>My dear Cou&s;in,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>My hou&s;e in town is magnificently fitted up to receive you&mdash;to my hou&s;e in the country I have added two wings, built in the ea&s;tern &s;tyle to make it more worthy your acceptance; my carriage, hor&s;es, and &s;ervants are waiting to conduct you to London; and I have got a &endq;bride for you, young, beautiful, and rich."</P>
</LETTER>
<P>There, that will plea&s;e the young Nabob: to be &s;ure it was unlucky my &s;hutting my doors again&s;t him before he went to India, but the&s;e attentions, and bringing his &s;i&s;ter Cecilia to my hou&s;e, will remove former prejudices, and make it a mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful &s;peculation&mdash;there, di&s;patch.</P>

<P>Then by marrying him to my ward Em|meline, I &s;hall prevent any overhawling of accounts, and if I keep her clo&s;e till he arrives&mdash;here comes my wife in a rage at my refu&s;ing her money this morning&mdash;the mi&s;erly &s;pendthrifts! to be &s;aving farthings in the comforts and nece&s;&s;aries of life, and wa&s;ting hundreds in luxuries and &s;uperfluities.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady Pro.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So, Mr. Project, how dare you refu&s;e me money when I conde&s;cend to &s;end for it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Project.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e 'tis time to grow prudent, madam. Wait the event of my &s;peculations before you let folly and extravagance again undo us.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="7" REF="10">
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady Pro.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Extravagance!&mdash;Sir, 'tis your &s;pecula|tions that have undone us&mdash;haven't they all fail'd?&mdash;didn't the fir&s;t wi&s;e bubble bur&s;t into air?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Project.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The fir&s;t, madam!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady Pro.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: didn't you give two thou&s;and pounds for a picture gallery? think the pictures all originals? call it the A&s;iatic A&s;iphu&s;icon, and &s;ay you &s;hould make a fortune by its exhibition?&mdash;very well, &s;ir, and didn't the famous picture that you advertis'd, as "the celebrated champion of England, by Rembrant," turn out to be nothing more than an old &s;ign of St. George and the Dragon, blown down from an alehou&s;e in Leadenhall Market? wasn't the boa&s;ted beech tree, by Claude Lorraine, daub'd out a week before by a gla&s;ier's boy, in Cheap-&s;ide?&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Project.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, no Madam. Be&s;ides if it was, didn't the &s;peculation on bark make me ample amends? didn't I, by the monopoly of that medi|cine, di&s;po&s;e of it at my own price?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady Pro.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No: for the doctors and apothecaries, finding they could get no profit by it, &s;wore bark was unwhole&s;ome phy&s;ic, and nobody took it.&mdash;Then didn't you run up &s;o many new hou&s;es at Paddington that many of them were built without &s;tair ca&s;es; and by the time one part was fini&s;h'd, didn't another fall all to pieces?&mdash;wasn't&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Project.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds! have you done, ma'am?&mdash;I &s;ay it is your fal&s;e oeconomy that has hurt my fortune: &s;aving trifles and &s;quandering thou&s;ands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady Pro.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Squandering!&mdash;What, &s;ir, do you pretend I don't con&s;ult cheapne&s;s?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Project.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: but how, madam? you will lame my be&s;t hor&s;es by &s;ending them to a cheap black|&s;mith, and then give a hundred pounds for a ham|mercloth&mdash;you will quarrel with your maid for
<PB N="8" REF="11">burning two candles in&s;tead of one; and the &s;ame night lo&s;e a thou&s;and pounds at faro&mdash;and, an&s;wer me fairly, that you might u&s;e otto of ro&s;es in&s;tead of lavender, haven't you &s;ent me to bed &s;upperle&s;s for a whole month?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady Pro.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well: and what then, &s;ir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Project.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then you &s;tint the &s;ervants in meat and drink, only to dre&s;s them with bags and no&s;egays&mdash;and once when you gave one hundred and fifty pounds for a curricle, didn't you want me to drive two miles over impa&s;&s;able roads, only to avoid paying a turnpike?&mdash;another time when you and your favourite Sir Frederick&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady Pro.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There he always &s;trikes me dumb&mdash;Oh! if I could recriminate! <STAGE><HI>(a&s;ide.)</HI></STAGE> Well, &s;ir: what of Sir Frederick? I'm &s;ure there's no impropriety in our intimacy: we are never t&ecirc;te a t&ecirc;te&mdash;At the theatre, the opera, all public places, my grand|mother is always pre&s;ent; and if ever Sir Frede|rick ki&s;t the tip of my finger, the old lady &s;aw it&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Project.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That's impo&s;&s;ible: for the old lady's as blind as Cupid.&mdash;However, it isn't our intere&s;t to quarrel; and if my &s;chemes on the Alderman and the Nabob turn out as I expect, you &s;hall have what money you de&s;ire&mdash;come, &s;hake hands,&mdash;and now walk with me towards Aldgate farm, and I'll explain to you all my plans.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady Pro.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Aldgate farm! there again! pray, &s;ir, to whom do you owe the power you have over the Alderman? By who&s;e means is that lump of agri|culture become an annuity to you?&mdash;have not my charms lur'd him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Project.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>To be &s;ure: he too has a blindne&s;s; and by his own affectation of intrigue, and your flattering his vanity&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady Pro.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>He is become &s;o attach'd to the wife,
<PB N="9" REF="12">that the hu&s;band may &s;peculate him out of all his property. Well, &s;ir, &s;ince you confe&s;s the obligation, I'll walk with you, and &s;ee how this curious gentle|man farmer goes on. Saturday is the day, I think, the ru&s;tick comes from London.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Project.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It is: and as u&s;ual he only comes to paint his outhou&s;es and neglect his land.&mdash;The farm is mine, and he thinks I &s;hall give him a long lea&s;e; but when I find he has fini&s;h'd his improvements, I'll let it over his head.&mdash;Oh, Eliza! this is the age for &s;peculation&mdash;People love delu&s;ion&mdash;ay, &s;o much that the more you dupe them, the better they like you, and while a rich citizen &s;hall propo&s;e a fair &s;cheme which nobody adopts, a da&s;hing we&s;t-end of the town gentleman &s;hall &s;tart a vi&s;ionary one, and, hey! pre&s;to!&mdash;every body meets him in full cry&mdash;This is my plan, and &s;o the Nabob and the gentle|man farmer &s;hall find it.</P>

<P>Profit! a&s;k my bailiff about that. The

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Emme.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, I cannot, &s;ir; but very likely it re&s;ults from the &s;atisfaction of having done a gene|rous action, and the emotion is new, becau&s;e like too many others, you have perhaps &s;acrific'd your time and happine&s;s at the &s;hrine of fa&s;hion.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Lady Pro.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Impo&s;&s;ible!&mdash;The only mode of &s;ettling my hu&s;band's affairs, is by Sir Frederick's marrying Emmeline; and therefore as my pride will not &s;uffer him to remain in pri&s;on, and the living there is too expen&s;ive, I &s;hall make the Alderman &s;ign this agreement which binds him in a penalty of ten thou&s;and pounds&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Tanjore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Make him &s;ign this agreement&mdash;make him renew Emmeline's malady&mdash;break his &s;on's heart&mdash;&s;eparate&mdash;cur&s;e it! what's the u&s;e of win|ning, when money will not purcha&s;e even momentary gratification?

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Tanjore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I hope &s;o. It's an old attachment. He's a worthy fellow, and next to being a Nabob my&s;elf, I &s;hould like to be brother to one.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady Pro.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Come, Sir Frederick; I believe we'd better retire: only I beg leave to ob&s;erve, that if any body defames my character, I &s;hall pro&s;ecute them notwith&s;tanding the expences of the law. I'll have my reputation ju&s;tified if it co&s;ts me five pounds. Come, &s;ir.</P>

<P>Edward, forget and forgive my boy. Though Project has hurt Emmeline's fortune, there's enough left, to make you live happy&mdash;if not,

<P>Yes; I cock'd the knave, bu$ $word$ all the Spani&s;h&mdash;hang it! I'm half tir'd of gaming, and if I won ten thou&s;and a year, I don't think I could tell how to &s;pend it?</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Tanjore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Couldn't you? then take a wife, Jack, and &s;he'll tell you how to &s;pend it&mdash;enter into the &s;chool of matrimony, Mr. Batchelor of Arts, and there fini&s;h your education.&mdash;Cecily here, has &s;et you an example: haven't you&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cecilia.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have from two motives: fir&s;t becau&s;e Mr. Henry Tanjore has long won my affections, and &s;econdly becau&s;e he means to give affluence to his name&s;ake. My dear brother, you may now return to India and live in a palace in reality; for a third of my hu&s;band's rupees and pagodas are at your di&s;po&s;al.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Tanjore. (&s;haking his head.)</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Hereafter perhaps it may find one like Emmeline's.&mdash;Till then, I &s;hall pur&s;ue a plan, which had Project follow'd, he had now been happy&mdash;that is, not to wa&s;te a fortune in di&s;&s;ipation, and try to retrieve it, by fal&s;e and unju&s;t Speculation.</P>
