<HEAD>REMARKS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>SUch was the Strength of a Strugling Party in this Nation,
that it cannot be expected they &s;hould go off of the Stage
of Action without making various Efforts, to retrieve
their Expiring Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>And 'tis a peculiar Happine&s;s to the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;h't
Peace of this Government, to &s;ee the Oppo&s;ers of the Publick
Good, thus brought to the la&s;t Extremities.</P>
<P>Envy, (like the dying Pangs of a &s;trong Man) is known by
its particular Efforts; the Convul&s;ions Expiring Nature falls
into, when the fatal Parting is in view, are &s;o particular, that
you may know the approaching Separation is near, by the pro|per
Symptoms of Death upon the Patient.</P>
<P>Thus the Struggles of the Party, in this Kingdom, have ma|nife&s;t
Tokens and Symptoms upon them of the approaching
Death of their Cau&s;e; They are de&s;cended to Railing,
in&s;tead of Argument; to Prevarications in Fact, to reproaching
Vertue, to defaming Merit, to &s;earching for Crimes, and ac|cu&s;ing
the Innocent, to Sugge&s;tion, Surmi&s;e, Mi&s;-con&s;truction,
pretended Fore-bodings, prophe&s;ying Evil Tidings, canting
Exclamations, and all the little and low Steps that have the
lea&s;t Pro&s;pect, tho' not of Bettering their own Cau&s;e, yet of
Dividing, Blackening, and Throwing Dirt upon tho&s;e who&s;e
Vertues they hate, becau&s;e they envy their Glory.</P>
<P>Time was, this Party made Attempts that had &s;ome Air of
Vigour, and of which there was &s;ome rea&s;on to be Apprehen|&s;ive;
and in &s;uch Ca&s;es the Nation was really, and indeed, ju&s;t|ly
allarm'd at them, and took Care with Needful Caution, to
prevent their Mi&s;chievous De&s;igns; and tho' they were indeed
treated like Children, or Mad-men, <HI>for whom we retain a Re&s;pect,
tho' they would mi&s;chief us,</HI> and their Hands were only tyed
<PB N="2" REF="4">
from Harm, without giving them the Per&s;onal Mortifications
they had de&s;erv'd; yet it was thought likewi&s;e proper to re|move
them from all Power of doing Ill, by taking the edg'd
Tools and wicked Weapons out of their Hands, &s;uch as Legi&s;la|tion,
Mini&s;try, Commands, Commi&s;&s;ions, Tru&s;ts, Sallaries,
di&s;po&s;al of Offices, and the like.</P>
<P>While they had the&s;e Things in their Hands, the Lunacy of
their Heads made them Dangerous People; and it was
too much in their Power, to make Experiments, tack
Per&s;ecution Laws, betray Councils, di&s;appoint Expeditions, re|tard
Preparations, erect Parties, influence Governours, infringe
Liberties, invade Properties, and a thou&s;and other things pe|culiar
to the Principle of their Party, to Divide this Nation, Ex|po&s;e
us to fatal Di&s;&s;entions at Home, and at la&s;t deliver us up to
Potent Enemies Abroad.</P>
<P>But now the Power of doing the&s;e Mi&s;chiefs is taken from
them, and they are remov'd at a due Di&s;tance from Action,
the Nation has a double Satisfaction; one, to &s;ee 'tis out of
their Power to Effect tho&s;e publick and fatal Di&s;orders they had
in their De&s;ign; and the other, to &s;ee them di&s;cover plainly
what was in their very Nature, and what they would have
Executed by the weak Self-de&s;troying Efforts of an Impotent
Ungovern'd Rage.</P>
<P>Now, like the Dog that bites the Stone, becau&s;e he cannot
reach the Hand that throws it, they act all the mo&s;t weak, fool|i&s;h,
and ab&s;urd Parts, that Di&s;traction and De&s;peration can
Dictate.</P>
<P>I could enumerate abundance of the&s;e Unaccountable Expre&s;|&s;ions
of the pre&s;ent Frenzy of the Party, &s;uch as High-Church
Memorials, Inflammation-Sermons, Coffee-hou&s;e-Declamations,
Noble P&mdash;r's Speeches, H-&mdash;of C-&mdash;Tower-Excur&s;ions,
and the like: All which, were I to di&s;cu&s;s the Particulars, I
would freely appeal to the Gentlemen them&s;elves, whether
they have not &s;en&s;ibly &s;unk their own Cau&s;e, weaken'd the
very Opinions of their own Admirers, di&s;courag'd their Friends,
driven Numbers of wavering Auxiliar Converts from them,
and by Con&s;equence, confirm'd the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment of Par|ty-Peace
in the Nation, at the Expence of all their Hopes,
Pro&s;pects, and Expectations.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5">
And as a further Demon&s;tration of the &s;en&s;ible Decay of
the Numbers, Intere&s;ts, and Hopes of the Party, we find them,
now de&s;cend yet lower; and cloathing them&s;elves in various
Shapes, they &s;toop to act in Ma&s;querade, and Counterfeit that
Hone&s;ty they would Overthrow; and even in this, they have
the Happine&s;s to make &s;uch mi&s;erable Cha&s;ma's and Spaces in
their Scenes, that the De&s;ign lies Naked to Common View, and
he mu&s;t be unaccountably blind, that cannot &s;ee through the
thin Covering of this fooli&s;h, and mo&s;t ridiculous Di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e there were &s;ome People who could not under|&s;tand
<HI>the Shorte&s;t Way with the Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> and who&s;e Judgments
are too often hood-wink't with light Out&s;ides, that (like the
Old Woman, <HI>That could &s;ee the Needle, but could not &s;ee the
Barn</HI>) overlook Things at Hand, and &s;ee Things Remote:
The Author of this, hopes they will not take it ami&s;s, if he at|tempts
to Expo&s;e the Nudities of the pre&s;ent Undertakings, and
tell the World who they are, and with what De&s;ign, that
amu&s;e the Age with fal&s;e Lights, the <HI>Igni fatui,</HI> of Abortive
Envy, and Defeated Malice.</P>
<P>If pur&s;uing this De&s;ign, brings me to con&s;ider more particu|larly
&s;ome Per&s;ons and Things which too ju&s;tly merit their
Place among the Di&s;turbers of the Nation's Peace, let &s;uch as
think them&s;elves touch'd, blame their own Guilt. I &s;hall a|void
Per&s;onal Reflections as much as po&s;&s;ible; but Truth being
the only Thing capable of Effecting this Nece&s;&s;ary Underta|king,
it mu&s;t be &s;poken out; and if its Plainne&s;s affects any
Body, the rea&s;on of it will be found among them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It would be endle&s;s to enter upon the many little Steps, ta|ken
by tho&s;e I am talking of, to rai&s;e Du&s;t in the Eyes of the
People, again&s;t their Benefactors; I &s;hall therefore fix my Di&s;|cour&s;e
upon a late Extraordinary Pamphlet, Entituled, <HI>A Let|ter
to the Author of the Memorial of the State of</HI> England.</P>
<P>To u&s;her this Book into the World, it was nece&s;&s;ary to find
&s;uch a Thing, of which <HI>Hudibras</HI> gives a very &s;ignificant De|&s;cription.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;a Tool</L>
<L>Which Wi&s;e Men work with, call'd a F&mdash;.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6">
To find out this, requir'd &s;ome Art; for to have brought one
of their own Party upon the Stage, had been only calling a
Spade, a Spade, and been Memorial the <HI>&s;econd,</HI> the &s;ame Thing
over again; but it was nece&s;&s;ary, the Man &s;hould not only talk
like a Whig, but <HI>be a Whig,</HI> at lea&s;t one that had pa&s;t for &s;uch,
and who&s;e Di&s;gui&s;e was not yet thrown off.</P>
<P>This was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that the Di&s;&s;enters might be
effectually cheated, amus'd, and wheedl'd, to fall in with the
Thing, give it their good Word; and, as &s;ome Men are al|ways
to be found that love Calumny, &s;hould give a better
Reception to it in the World.</P>
<P>To forward this, it was indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread abroad, that it
was wrote by a Di&s;&s;enter; the Book was &s;ecretly handed about
among &s;ome of our unhappily, and too ignorantly prejudic'd
Friends, and the Delu&s;ion &s;pread a great way.</P>
<P>At la&s;t it came out, and appeared to be wrote by a Clergy|man
of the Ch. of <HI>England,</HI> and as &s;uch I am to con&s;ider it.</P>
<P>The Book (<HI>to give a &s;hort De&s;cription of it</HI>) is <HI>Another Shorte&s;t
Way with the Di&s;&s;enters;</HI> a Papi&s;t &s;et up for a-Patriot, a Devil
in the Di&s;gui&s;e of a Whig, a High-Church-man Ma&s;queraded
into a <HI>Williamite;</HI> and the Cloven Foot appears &s;o Naked, that
he cannot tax me with want of Charity in my Opinion; for who
can re&s;i&s;t Demon&s;tration?</P>
<P>I allow, in &s;ome parts of it, the Colours are lively enough,
and &s;ome, even of the Wi&s;er, may be deceiv'd; and I &s;hall not
be wanting to do him Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>There was a Book wrote &s;ome Months &s;ince, Entituled, <HI>A
Memorial of the State of</HI> England, <HI>in an&s;wer to the Memorial of
the Church.</HI> I &s;hall not trouble this Tract with my Opinion of its
Performance; I believe it was hone&s;tly meant; if it had a
&s;oft Place in it, or any imperfect, or ill-manag'd Part, 'twas
under that Head, where he takes upon him, to defend the
pre&s;ent Mini&s;try, by making Reflections on &s;ome Gentlemen
that Manag'd in King <HI>William's</HI> Time.</P>
<P>That this gives the Author of this Pamphlet a good Handle,
and &s;ome Advantage, I am very free to own; but whether he
makes a ju&s;t U&s;e of it, will come under the Cognizance of the
En&s;uing Sheets.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7">
Without doubt, this Mi&s;take of the Author of <HI>The State-Memorial,</HI>
put it into our Author's Head, to Per&s;onate the
Whig, and make a Scheme, which without que&s;tion in its fir&s;t
Pro&s;pect, pleas'd the Contriver very well; for on the foot of
this Project, he fancies he has bid fair for a Three-fold Divi|&s;ion.</P>
<P>1.
To divide the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try from the la&s;t, and break
the good Corre&s;pondance between the Gentlemen Managing
under King <HI>William,</HI> and tho&s;e to whom Her Maje&s;ty has com|mitted
the publick Affairs; as if acting from the &s;ame General
Principles of publick Good, they mu&s;t differ, becau&s;e the Per|&s;ons
and Circum&s;tances, under which they acted, do not exact|ly
chime.</P>
<P>2. To divide the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try from one another, bend|ing
the Stre&s;s of their Forces again&s;t one part, and leaving o|thers
untouch'd, that if po&s;&s;ible, they might &s;eem to render
one Culpable, and the other Innocent; and prompt the Inno|cent
to &s;eparate from the Guilty, to avoid the Cenfure.</P>
<P>3. To divide between the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try and the People,
and fill the Nation with Jealou&s;ies and Di&s;like of tho&s;e, who
hazard their All to &s;erve them, to fill the Nation with Reflections
upon their be&s;t Endeavours, throw Dirt at their Per&s;ons, and
&s;ugge&s;t Evil De&s;igns, even from the Be&s;t and Uprighte&s;t Pro|ceedings
in the World.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e De&s;igns, has the only proper Advantage
the Author wanted, <HI>viz.</HI> to cover him with the pretended Vi|zor
of a Whig; and 'tis as apparent, that all the fine &s;oft
Things he &s;ays of the Gentlemen he would be thought to de|fend,
are meerly Ironical, at lea&s;t in his De&s;ign; as 'tis certain,
tho&s;e Gentlemen need no Defence of their Actions from any
thing, which the pre&s;ent Methods of the Government, or Mi|ni&s;try,
lays upon them.</P>
<P>As to the Mi&s;taken Politicks of the Author of <HI>the State-Me|morial,</HI>
I &s;hall leave the two Authors to defend them&s;elves as
well as they can, and proceed a little to di&s;&s;ect the Hypocrite
in this before me, and thro' his Weak Coverings, to di&s;cover
what's apparently hidden under his Sheep's Cloathing.</P>
<P>He begins his Epi&s;tle, to the Author of <HI>the State-Memorial,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="8">
with a &s;eeming Complement, upon the fir&s;t Three Parts of his
Book, and tells him 'tis Unan&s;werable; &s;o di&s;tinct, &s;o &s;olid, &s;o
clo&s;e, that 'tis without Exception, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and yet, even in this
very fir&s;t Paragraph, di&s;covers him&s;elf in one of the Keene&s;t
Satyrs of all his Book, <HI>viz.</HI> very Civilly calling him <HI>Coxcomb,</HI>
that had not &s;aid one Word but what had been &s;aid before,
had borrow'd all his Arguments from other People that had
Treated on the &s;ame Subject; and &s;o his whole Book, and all
its Unan&s;werable, Unexceptionable Beauties, were not one
Word to the Purpo&s;e, and left the Age not a jot the Wi&s;er.</P>
<Q>&startq;Nor do I E&s;teem it the le&s;s, becau&s;e the Argument is Ex|hau&s;ted,
and thereby Di&s;cu&s;s'd before, by &s;everal
Able Hands. <HI>p. 1. l.</HI> 8.&endq;</Q>
<P>This is all <HI>Sarca&s;tick;</HI> and to &s;ay he does not E&s;teem it the
le&s;s, <HI>is be&s;towing the Favour,</HI> as if he had &s;aid, <HI>Nor, Sir, do I
E&s;teem it the le&s;s,</HI> tho' I ought to do &s;o, <HI>&s;ince you have &s;aid no|thing,
but what Wi&s;er Men have &s;aid before you.</HI></P>
<P>Ob&s;erve next, how he comes to di&s;cour&s;e of Per&s;ecution, and
when he would pretend to explode it; he ju&s;tifies it from the
very Example quoted by his Adver&s;ary, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q>&startq;I will not deny, but that &s;omething might rea&s;onably have
been &s;aid for Per&s;ecution of Di&s;&s;enters in the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Com|mon-wealth,
and among Turks and Heathens, who&s;e
main Points of Religion con&s;i&s;ted in the <HI>Opera operata</HI> of
External Ceremonies, and Bodily Performances, which,
as to the Matter and Manner of them, were laid down
and in&s;tituted in expre&s;s, po&s;itive and intelligible Terms:
But to talk of Per&s;ecution in a Religion which con&s;i&s;ts of
My&s;teries and Duties which are to be believ'd, and per|form'd
altogether in a mental and &s;piritual Manner, and
which the Infliction of Corporal Puni&s;hments can in no
manner influence o$ amend, mu&s;t needs be the mo&s;t mon|&s;trous
and ab&s;urd Conceit that ever enter'd into the
Minds of &s;uch, who have the Priviledge of Think|ing.&endq;</Q>
<P>Now 'tis apparent, that the Per&s;ecution of Di&s;&s;enters here
pretended to be argued again&s;t, <HI>is not</HI> for that part of Religion
which <HI>con&s;i&s;ts of My&s;teries and Duties, which are to be believ'd
<PB N="7" REF="9">
and perform'd altogether in a mental and &s;piritual Manner, p.</HI> 1. but
for tho&s;e Things which, <HI>as he &s;ays,</HI> con&s;i&s;t in <HI>the opera operata
of External Ceremonies, and Bodily Performances,</HI> ibid. and for
the&s;e, he owns it proper to per&s;ecute: So that this is fairly an
Attempt, under the Colour of Exploding Per&s;ecution in gene|ral,
to ju&s;tfy it in particular; and to me, &s;eems a plain In&s;inu|ation,
that it is Lawful to Per&s;ecute Di&s;&s;enters, who differ a|bout
the <HI>opera operata</HI> of External Ceremonies, but not the Pa|pi&s;ts,
who differ in My&s;teries and Duties, to be perform'd in a
mental and &s;piritual Manner.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be very loth to be tax'd here with a Breach of Cha|rity,
in charging this &s;eeming Whig, with Advocating for the
Papi&s;ts; but I hope the following Particulars will clear me of
that Scandal; wherein I think it will appear, without Po&s;&s;ibili|ty
of Di&s;pute, That either this Author is <HI>a Papi&s;t</HI> in his Heart,
or one of tho&s;e Exceeding Charitable Church-men, who have
lately taken up that very Modern Chri&s;tian Principle, That
<HI>they had rather be Papi&s;ts, than Di&s;&s;enters;</HI> or if not, he &s;incere|ly
Advocates for the Papi&s;t, in order to Conceal him&s;elf as a
Whig; the <HI>My&s;tery</HI> of which is <HI>wholly Mental,</HI> as he notes of Re|ligion,
and pa&s;t my Under&s;tanding to unfold.</P>
<P>To make out this Charge, I appeal to his next Argument a|gain&s;t
Per&s;ecution; wherein, taking what he &s;ays for granted,
he proves the Church of <HI>England</HI> ought to be per&s;ecuted by the
Papi&s;ts, and the Di&s;&s;enters by the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as plain,
as that two and three makes five. See <HI>p. 2. l.</HI> 7.</P>
<Q>&startq;Toleration therefore is a Claim which all Chri&s;tians may
demand as a Natural and Common Right, unle&s;s it be
tho&s;e that refu&s;e the &s;ame Ju&s;tice to their Fellow-Crea|tures;
for it is evident, that &s;uch Per&s;ons ought to be
Excluded from it; as tho&s;e who will not &s;uffer others to
live, forfeit the Title to their own Lives.&endq;</Q>
<P>Now the next five Pages of the Book are wholly taken up,
in proving, That both the Di&s;&s;enters to the Church of <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
and the Church of <HI>England</HI> to the Papi&s;ts, did, when in
their Power, deny Toleration to others; and what can be more
Natural, than to argue from thence, that both ought to be ex|cluded
from it them&s;elves? And which he very naturally does to
<PB N="8" REF="10">
my Hand, where he owns it his Opinion, they ought to be per&s;e|cuted,
eve$$n &s;o many Words, <HI>p. 2. l. 2, 3, He that per&s;ecutes
for Opinion, let him &s;uffer for Opinion.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true, the Author draws another Inference, which &s;till,
as he thinks, carrys on the Mask, but too poorly to hide the
former De&s;ign: His Inference is <HI>P.</HI> 2. That the whole Con|tention
in <HI>England</HI> is about Places and Pen&s;ions, and that the
Clamours of promoting the Intere&s;t of the Church, have had
no other Ultimate Con&s;equence the&s;e twenty Years.</P>
<P>Now tho' this may be partly too true in Fact, yet I cannot
&s;ee how this Relative belongs to the other Antecedent, how this
Conclu&s;ion can be drawn from the other Premi&s;es; which, to
my Apprehen&s;ion, are as remote as <HI>Mahomet</HI> and <HI>Jupiter.</HI></P>
<P>But the other Argument, I think, &s;tands fairly prov'd in his
Book, and of which I draw this &s;hort Ab&s;tract from his own
Words.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Per&s;ons who refu&s;e Toleration to others, ought to be Excluded
from it them&s;elves. <HI>Letter, p. 2. l.</HI> 9.</P>
<P>But the Di&s;&s;enters, when uppermo&s;t, prov'd mo&s;t Furious in their
Per&s;ecutions, and would Exerci&s;e the &s;ame, or wor&s;e Cruelties, <HI>&amp;c.
Letter, p. 3. l.</HI> 10, 17, 21.</P>
<P>But the C. of <HI>E.</HI> in the Days of <HI>Ed.</HI> 6. burnt an Anabapti&s;t,
Heretick, and <HI>Cranmer</HI> pre&s;s'd the King to Sign the Warrant.
<HI>p. 5. l.</HI> 21.</P>
<P><HI>Ergo,</HI> Neither the <HI>Di&s;&s;enter,</HI> nor the <HI>Church of England</HI> de|&s;erve,
but ought to be Excluded from Toleration.</P>
<P>If this be not fair arguing from the Premi&s;es here laid down,
I am content to &s;ubmit, and when fairly refuted, will ask
Pardon.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, <HI>if it be,</HI> I refer the Principles of my
Antagoni&s;t, who pretends him&s;elf a <HI>Whig,</HI> to the Judgment of
every Impartial Reader.</P>
<P>His <HI>Reflections</HI> all along, upon the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and
upon Arch-bi&s;hop <HI>Cranmer</HI>'s Con&s;tancy, which he &s;ays, was
quite different at his Death, from that of a <HI>Socinian,</HI> that was
al&s;o burnt in K. <HI>Edward</HI>'s Days, farther explain the Man; and
it cannot but rai&s;e the Wonder of any Man, to &s;ee a Man cloath'd
with the Office and Honour of a Ch. of <HI>England</HI> Mini&s;ter, fir&s;t
<PB N="9" REF="11">
defend the Papi&s;ts, then call the <HI>Socinian</HI> a good Chri&s;tian, then
plead for Per&s;ecuting the Di&s;&s;enter, and at la&s;t expo&s;e the Na|kedne&s;s
of the C. of <HI>England</HI> it &s;elf, and upbraid that very
Church <HI>He is a Mini&s;ter of,</HI> with burning an Anabapti&s;t imme|diately
after &s;he was her &s;elf deliver'd from the Fire and Fag|got
of Popi&s;h Per&s;ecution; a Thing, however true and ju&s;tly
to be cen&s;ur'd, he &s;hould have been one of the la&s;t Men to have
brought to Remembrance; and no Hi&s;tory, but the <HI>Roman</HI>
Account of that Day, ever reflected upon the Conduct of that
Ble&s;&s;ed Martyr in his la&s;t Moments; the burning of his right
Hand, in Dete&s;tation of his &s;inful Compliance with them, be|ing
never di&s;puted, no, not by his Enemies.</P>
<P>I could give another Demon&s;tration of the Principle of this
Author, from a farther Excur&s;ion of his <HI>meer Self, p. 5. l.</HI> 6, 7,
8; where, <HI>the E&s;&s;ay at Catholick Communion,</HI> a Book lately
wrote by a known Papi&s;t, is plainly Reviv'd, and a Tolerati|on
of Popery demanded as a piece of Ju&s;tice of the Di&s;&s;enters,
being the &s;ame Thing lately recommended to the Di&s;&s;enters by
Mr. <HI>Toland,</HI> as follows.</P>
<Q>And I think, at this time, it would tend very much to their Honour, as
well as Benefit (&s;peaking to the Di&s;&s;enters) to approve of an &V;niver&s;al
Toleration of all manner of Opinions that are meerly religious, and
re&s;pect Con&s;cience only.</Q>
<P>I think I have &s;aid enough to unmask our Author as to his
Religion. I &s;hall proceed now, to examine his Politicks; and
I think, he will di&s;cover him&s;elf more plainly here than before.</P>
<P>I am not very much concern'd to debate, whether the Au|thor
of the <HI>State Memorial</HI> has given him the Advantage he

gain'd a great deal of Honour for their Endeavours, to pre&s;erve to us
the Prote&s;tant Religion, together with our Rights and Liberties, entire;
when others, who have &s;ucceeded them in the &s;ame Po&s;ts, have done all
that lay in their Power, to root up the very Foundation of Property and
true Religion.</Q>
<P>If he means the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try, he cannot be right, be|cau&s;e

<Q>I would not be thought to detract from the good Qualifications of any,
whom Her Maje&s;ty has thought fit to Employ in the Admini&s;tration
of Affairs.</Q>
<P>I omit interrupting him in his <HI>Panegyrick upon the Reign and
Mini&s;try of King William;</HI> tho' his De&s;ign of Embroiling the
Gentlement of that Time, with tho&s;e of this Reign, which he
treats with the Scandalous Term of <HI>Con&s;pirators, p.</HI> 11. a Ca|lumny
not worth enquiring into, is very Con&s;picuous.</P>
<P>Nor &s;hall I examine here, the already Thorowly-debated
Point of Disbanding the Army; neither is it material, &s;ince 'tis
very po&s;&s;ible, that two Per&s;ons may act in differing Mea&s;ures
from the &s;ame hone&s;t Principle of the Publick Good.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e In&s;tances, 'tis plain, are reviv'd, not &s;o much
to defend the Mini&s;try of tho&s;e Gentlemen, who&s;e Actions
need none of his Oratory to defend them, as to render odious
the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try, upon whom he all along pretends to thro'
the Burthen of every Di&s;appointment in the la&s;t Reign, fre|quently
treats them as Traytors to the Publick, and <HI>Con&s;piring
again&s;t the Welfare and Happine&s;s of their Country,</HI> p. 10. l. 22.
p. 12. l. 30.</P>
<P>And I cannot but ob&s;erve here, that in the la&s;t of the&s;e re|cited
Places, he brings a mo&s;t Notable Proof of the&s;e Gentle|men
that are now in the Mini&s;try, con&s;piring again&s;t the Safe|ty
of the Common-wealth in the la&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> That the&s;e Gentle|men
brought in the Bill, <HI>for Regulating Tryals in Ca&s;es of
Trea&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>The weighty Rea&s;on he gives for this Charge, is very Re|markable,
<HI>viz.</HI> They hop'd they might carry on their Contri|vances
and Machinations with greater Succe&s;s and Security.</P>
<P>Now, certainly the&s;e were the fir&s;t Men, who, re&s;olving to
be Traytors, promoted Laws to procure fair Tryals; Men of
Guilt &s;eldom move, to have the Proceedings againdt them Re|gulated;
and that this Occult Project was true, is very uncer|tain,
and the Sugge&s;tion very pre&s;umptive, as it is really ve|ry
improbable.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="13">
A Judgment of Common Charity would rather conclude
that a Care of Po&s;terity, lea&s;t being &s;worn into Plots they were
innocent of, they &s;hould be hurry'd out of their Lives upon
&s;light Evidence, Innuendoes, and &s;ugge&s;ted Crimes, mov'd their
propo&s;ing &s;uch a Law; and the Proof, that none of the&s;e Con|&s;pirators,
as he vilely calls them, have ever &s;ince had occa&s;ion
of tho&s;e Laws, ought, one would think, to have guarded their
Repuration from &s;uch a &s;candalous <HI>Innuendo.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is this Author le&s;s <HI>Sarca&s;tick,</HI> even upon the Gentlemen
he would defend, and thereby plainly &s;hows, how all along he
mingles the Gall with the Liquid; when applauding their op|po&s;ing
this Law, he tells us, <HI>p.</HI> 13, it was <HI>their Zeal for the
Safety of the King;</HI> as if tho&s;e Gentlemen, or the King Him|&s;elf
either, drove at the Royal Safety, by the little Illegal Pra|cti&s;es
of the Law, by which &s;o many had been hurry'd out of
the World, in the former Reigns, and were afraid to give Cri|minals
Fair and Regulated Tryals for their Lives.</P>
<P>Thus, fir&s;t, he Charges Hone&s;t Gentlemen, oppo&s;ing a good
Law, with de&s;ign to pre&s;erve the King, and the&s;e Gentlemen,
bringing in this Good Law, with de&s;ign to betray him.</P>
<P>The Malice of this is &s;o gro&s;s, and the Covering &s;o thin; that,
I think, I need &s;ay no more to Expo&s;e it; and the Breach he
would fain make here, can never take Effect, becau&s;e all Men
know, that Law did take Effect; the King was not betray'd
by it; Traytors and A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inators were brought to condign
Puni&s;hment by Fair and Legal Proce&s;s; and without doubt,
Trea&s;on will be as well puni&s;h't by fair Proceedings, as by
Tricks and Advantages of Law, &s;ince we always find tho&s;e
Advantages us'd more again&s;t Innocent Men, than Guilty.</P>
<P>Fair Proof lies harde&s;t upon Men of Guilt; 'tis when Evil
Governments have a Mind to hook Men into Snares, that they
frame Points, make Con&s;tructive Judgments, and hurry Men
out of the World by Imperfect Methods.</P>
<P>Such as the&s;e, neither the King, nor that Mini&s;try, could
be capable of de&s;iring; it was below His Maje&s;ty to de&s;ire it;
they were &s;ome of the very Tyrannies he came hither to Abo|li&s;h$;
and no Man, Acting under His Maje&s;ty, could be &s;up|po&s;ed
to have &s;uch De&s;igns.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="14">
But 'tis &s;till more Ridiculous, that Men &s;hould pu&s;h at Laws,
for fair, legal, and unbya&s;s'd Ju&s;tice, that expected to Merit,
being brought upon the Stage of that Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>But &s;uch are the Shifts and Difficulties, thro' which our Au|thor
mu&s;t bring his Charge again&s;t the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try; and
&s;uch wrethed Arguments he is driven to, to prove the&s;e Gen|tlemen
Con&s;pirators; becau&s;e when they were to be taken,
they de&s;ir'd to be try'd fairly, it &s;eem'd rather to be, that
they apprehended they &s;hould be, one time or other, thus bar|barou&s;ly
us'd; and therefore re&s;olv'd to proceed &s;o, that when|ever
it happen'd, they might have fair Play for their Lives.</P>
<P>From this he goes on to the Ca&s;e of the Gentlemen, who
&s;till &s;uffer under the Su&s;pen&s;ion of the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act, which
I cannot but under&s;tand, to be meant as a Satyr upon the
King, and upon the Management of that Time: At the &s;ame
time that he is pretending to defend it, if he would have it be
otherwi&s;e under&s;tood, what need of his repeating, that it was
never done before, but in favour to the King.</P>
<P>As if he had &s;aid, that &s;u&s;pending of the Law was done in
favour of &s;o extraordinary a Per&s;on as King <HI>William.</HI> In what
was King <HI>William</HI> extraordinary as to this Ca&s;e, but in this
that he declar'd again&s;t Di&s;pen&s;ing Power, which was after|wards
practi&s;ed the fir&s;t time upon his particular account.</P>
<P>Now had this Gentleman gone on to tell us on who&s;e ac|count,
and at who&s;e motion this Su&s;pen&s;ion was continued,
even after the King who was that only Per&s;on concern'd was
dead, he might have clear'd up the matter and &s;hown us
&s;ome People that were willing to pre&s;erve the Example, who
can never be reproach'd with too much re&s;pect for King
<HI>William.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;u&s;pending this Law therefore out of a tender regard to
the Safety of this Prince, mu&s;t be a Banter, &s;ince 'tis &s;u&s;pended
&s;till, and the Per&s;ons kept confin'd to this day, how ju&s;tly I will
not determine, tho' that Prince has been dead &s;o many Years.</P>
<P>I &s;hall trace him no farther thro' the&s;e Parts, in which
he keeps up the Panegyrick iu Ma&s;querade; I freely joyn
with him in Recording the Memory of tho&s;e Gentlemen,
who&s;e peculiar Glory it is, that they are &s;o true to the Ge|neral

Good of their Native Country, and &s;o &s;atisfied of its

el&s;e in &s;ome Peoples De&s;igns, than barely &s;triving to

<P>From the&s;e Matters our Author de&s;cends to the Stage of
Publick Action, where you have him entirely di&s;cover'd and
the Mask thrown off, the whole De&s;ign appears naked, and
he &s;hews him&s;elf one of the New-modell'd Party, who are
Erecting a third Sort of Divi&s;ion in <HI>England</HI> as we &s;aw late|ly
in <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>The Queen has made U&s;e of but two Sorts of Men in the
Admini&s;tration, and this New Party pretends to like none of
them; and to bring their De&s;igns to a Head, the Founda|tion
is laid in Defamations, Decrying the be&s;t Actions and
Branding the be&s;t Endeavours to &s;erve our Country, and the&s;e
rallied together are all thrown upon the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>All Men that have their Eyes in their Heads, &s;ee plainly the
pre&s;ent De&s;ign is to run upon the Mini&s;try with Clamour
and Raillery, to throw Dirt at them and their Actions by
all po&s;&s;ible Methods of Rudene&s;s and Indecency, Pamphlets,
Speeches and Opprobrious Terms, and the Author of this
has made, <HI>I think,</HI> the Tenth E&s;&s;ay that Way, I mean in
Publick; and I think, I need not go back to Speeches, Vin|dication
of Speeches, Memorials, Sermons, and the various
Sub&s;equent Libells of the la&s;t three Months to enumerate
the re&s;t.</P>
<P>But for the pre&s;ent Gentleman he has indeed by a pecu|liar
Method of his own, thrown off the Vail of good Lan|guage
from his Stile, and falls upon them with an un-re|&s;train'd
Fury, his Arguments are all Po&s;itives, and the Con|&s;truction,
Meer Calling Rogue and Ra&s;cal without any to|lerable
Colour either of Rea&s;on or Argument.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t he begins, P. 17. with the Queen, he tells you,
<HI>He has &s;ome Rea&s;on to hope the War may terminate to our Ho|nour:</HI>

<PB N="10" REF="16">
<HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI> in Her <HI>Gracious</HI> and <HI>Glorious</HI> Speech has in a

<P>I am not willing to &s;train any Man's Meaning, and con|demn
him for thinking, but all People ought to have Sence
enough to &s;ee when they are banter'd; as to his Epithet
of <HI>Glorious</HI> to a Speech, I &s;hall &s;ay little to it, but tell you
a Story; I have heard of a Brave Hone&s;t Fi&s;herman of <HI>Pool</HI>
who when for more Courage than Brains, he was advanc'd,
to the Command of a Man of War, &s;aluted the Admiral al|ways
with the Title of Your <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Glory;</HI> Now he
that concludes any Thing from hence, but that either the
Admiral was banter'd, or the Captain a Blockhead, mu&s;t
&s;ee further into it than I; and the poor Captain was call'd
<HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> for it as long as he liv'd: 'Tis plain we
mu&s;t not call our Author Blockhead: what follows is as plain,
when he tells us of <HI>a Glorious Speech,</HI> I think, I under|der&s;tand
him right, and he wou'd have it pa&s;s for a Glo|rious
Banter, as to the <HI>Manners of it</HI> I leave that to the
Author: The Words following add &s;omething to the Ju|&s;tice
of this Opinion here, The Queen <HI>has in a Manner a&s;|&s;ur'd
us</HI> (&s;ays he P, 17.) or after a Fa&s;hion. -&mdash;Now if
we wou'd examine Her Maje&s;ty's Speech, I think 'tis plain
the Rea&s;ons are laid down, why the Queen thought the
Pro&s;pect laid before Her People hopeful and promi&s;ing;
and therefore to &s;ay <HI>It was A&s;&s;uring them IN A MANNER,</HI>
can be nothing bnt putting a Je&s;t upon the Queen, which

<Q>I have &s;ome Rea&s;on to hope, but much more to wi&s;h that the Pre&s;ent
War may in a &s;hort Time terminate to our Honour and Happine&s;s,

<P>Here you have a very brief Acknowledgment of my

which we have nothing &s;ubjoin'd; it being, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> true, that

<P>And &s;hall I enquire of this Gentleman &s;ome Particulars

<HI>no where &s;hewn</HI> but at <HI>Blenheim?</HI> Had this Author &s;aid, <HI>more
particularly &s;hewn at the Battle of Blenheim,</HI> he might have been
excus'd; but 'tis plain, this is &s;poken with an Empha&s;is at
the &s;ame time, detracting from the Merit of his former, and
other Actions.</P>
<P>Without doubt, the Anticedents to that Glorious Relative,
had as much, of both the Courage and Conduct of the Duke
in them, as the Action it &s;elf; the fir&s;t concerting that pro|digious
March, the amu&s;ing the <HI>French</HI> with the Uncertainty,
where the Storm would fall, and &s;o preventing their

the Pa&s;&s;ing by the Strong Encampment of the <HI>French</HI> and

<HI>Schellemberg,</HI> a Place that had been 14 Several Times A&s;&s;ault|ed

Man in <HI>Germany</HI> ever came nearer, than this Second, both in
Courage and Succe&s;s; and I make no Difficulty to &s;ay, That
the Attack at <HI>Schellenberg,</HI> as it fir&s;t gave the Enemy a Ta&s;te
of what they were to Expect, as it was an Attack upon the
Flower of their Troops, and in an Impregnable Po&s;t of Ad|vantage,
the Courage and Conduct of the Duke was more
Con&s;picuous in that Action, than in the Fight at <HI>Blenhiem,</HI> tho'
the Con&s;equence and Glory of the la&s;t reach'd farther; for
Actions are not always Truly Great in their Con&s;equences,
that are &s;o in their Management.</P>
<P>From this In&s;tance, I crave leave, previous to this Author's
Clamour, to ask, Whether the General Conduct of the War,
(let particular Actions &s;peak for them&s;elves) does not Confirm
the Conduct, and con&s;equently the Glory of the Duke of <HI>Marl|borough,</HI>
beyond all the little Reproaches of Cavilling and
Detracting Men, who Envy and Malign the Honours, the
whole World pays to his Merit?</P>
<P>To explain what I mean by this, I de&s;ire all con&s;idering Peo|ple
to examine, how the State of the War appears? How the
whole Form of its Management has receiv'd a General Turn
in <HI>Europe,</HI> by the Conduct of this One Man we would defame?</P>
<P>King <HI>William</HI>'s Glory no Man will di&s;pute, and even
his Enemies acknowledge; yet almo&s;t all his Reign, even
back to the fir&s;t of the&s;e Wars <HI>France</HI> gave Mea&s;ures to all
<HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Generals was to keep their Eyes up|on
the Motions of the <HI>French,</HI> the Secrecy and Celerity of
their Actions were the ju&s;t Subject of our Watchfulne&s;s and
Admiration, and you were to be &s;trong or weak here or
there, as they were expected to make their Efforts; the Con|federates
follow'd, but <HI>France</HI> always led.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="19">
Was the Seat of the War to be in <HI>Ireland?</HI> It was becau&s;e the

you.</P>
<P>In the beginning of this War, he &s;eiz'd every Appendice of

the 4th Part of the Way to March, they found the <HI>French</HI> up|on
the Banks of the <HI>Adige,</HI> and po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the Strong Pa&s;s at
<HI>Roveredo</HI> before them; and had the <HI>Germans</HI> been Commanded
by any Man but Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> (whom no Difficulty could
re&s;i&s;t) perhaps they had never got into <HI>Italy</HI> at all.</P>
<P>The King, who was as good a Judge of the Men, fit to car|ry
on the War, as of the War it &s;elf, recommended this Ge|neral,
and gave him that Character which his Grace has Effe|ctually
made good: And now, let any Man but view the Face
of the War, in the Management of this General.</P>
<P>You are no more concern'd, to enquire what Steps the <HI>French</HI>
take; but you have turn'd the Tables, and they take their
Mea&s;ures from you; you are not to examine into their Coun|cils,
or follow their Motions, <HI>B&V;T THEY YO&V;RS;</HI> the Secre|cy
or Celerity of their Motions, does not now alarm you &s;o
much as it us'd to do; for they are oblig'd now to wait as you
us'd to do, to &s;ee where the Gathering Cluds of their Enemies
will break.</P>
<P>The Effects of this are plain; you have divided their For|ces
in &s;o many Parts, they cannot get into the Field before you,
and &s;ecure their Summer's Work before-hand, and &s;o cut you
out the Labour of a Campaign, before you get into the Field;
but you lead them into the Field, as well as tell them, where
it &s;hall be; you are there before them, and they follow you to
Action, not knowing where to begin. The Advantages of
this Turn of Affairs, are too many for any Man that is not
wilfully blind, not to &s;ee them.</P>
<P>This gave you the Victory at <HI>Blenheim,</HI> while the <HI>French</HI>

their Lines; your Conque&s;ts in <HI>Al&s;ace</HI> &s;ummon 'em to the Up|per

to <HI>Valentia;</HI> fre&s;h Inva&s;ions &s;ummons 'em back to <HI>Anda|lu&s;ia,</HI>
and the Frontiers of <HI>Portugal:</HI> And thus you harra&s;s 'em
with various Scenes of Action, that formerly made the Seat of
War, where they pleas'd to be the Aggre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>Now you carry the War into their own Country, which
they always (till now) carry'd on in yours; they expect you
on the Frontiers of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and find you in <HI>Catalonia;</HI> and
they mu&s;t Traver&s;e whole <HI>Spain,</HI> to wait for you on the Fron|tiers
of the Kingdom of <HI>Arragon.</HI></P>

<P>I come next to exaamine the Little and Forg'd Allegations

that &s;ome People think, are &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify their being un|grateful
to the Deliverers of their Country; and here let us &s;ee
with what Indu&s;try Trifles are magnify'd; and Defect of Sub|&s;tance,
&s;upply'd with Forgery, Surmi&s;e and unfair Sugge&s;tion:
To &s;uch Exigence, was the Author of this Calumny reduc'd,
that he makes no Scruple to intrench upon his own Morals,
and &s;upply his De&s;ign with Slander and Fal&s;hood?</P>
<P>I am &s;orry a Man of his Cloath &s;hould forget, that <HI>Truth is
a Moral Vertue,</HI> which no hone&s;t Man can for&s;ake, and all Men
of Honour think them&s;elves bound to act by; and that when
he advanc'd what is &s;o obvious to every Man's Under&s;tanding,
he could not but expect to be an&s;wer'd to his Di&s;advantage;
and that the Project being detected, would infallibly fix &s;uch
a Scandal on his Sincerity, that no Man who regarded his Cha|racter,
could be ea&s;y under.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing this Man of Politicks goes upon, is to Re|proach
a Noble Peer, in his Speech in the Hou&s;e of Lords,
which he calls an <HI>Anniver&s;ary,</HI> with ignorantly laying the Blame
of our Mi&s;carriage la&s;t Year on our Confederates, which this
Gentleman will remove from them, to the Duke of <HI>Marl|borough.</HI></P>
<P>As to his Quotation of my Lord <HI>H&mdash;&s;hams,</HI> I leave him
to his Lord&s;hip's Re&s;entments; but his fixing the Matter on
the Duke, is infinitely ab&s;urd; as will appear in the Particu|lars
following.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="22">
<HI>1&s;t.</HI> He reckons up a Great Number of Misfortunes that hap|pen'd

<Q><P>That the <HI>French,</HI> who were broken, and di&s;tracted in their Mea&s;ures, have
thereupon re-a&s;&s;um'd their Courage, aud have had the Confidence to

Agents have been this Winter carrying on among the Northern Princes,
and the Mea&s;ures that have been concerted in tho&s;e Parts to break the
Confederacy, by rai&s;ing Di&s;putes and Quarrels among them&s;elves, and
&s;o nece&s;&s;itating them to withdraw their Troops from the Common Ser|vice,
is, as they &s;ay, owing to the &s;ame Mi&s;management.</P>
<P>The Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Lubec,</HI> the Difference between the States of <HI>Holland</HI>
and the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> and that Prince's De&s;ign of &s;ending Succour
to the <HI>Swede;</HI> the In&s;urrections in <HI>Bavaria,</HI> the Succe&s;s of the <HI>Male-contents</HI>
in <HI>Hungary,</HI> and the Straits and Difficulties of Prince <HI>Eu|gene,</HI>
are all put by the&s;e People to the &s;ame Score.</P></Q>
<P>2. He lays all this to the Duke's Charge, in his Retreat from
the <HI>Mo&s;elle;</HI> as follows.</P>
<Q><P>None of which would, or could have happen'd, if we had &s;tuck to our fir&s;t

Flight from the <HI>Mo&s;elle,</HI> towards the <HI>Mae&s;e</HI> and <HI>Sambre.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And, to prove this was the Duke's particular Fault, he tells us,

That part of the <HI>German</HI> Army had actually join'd us, and the re&s;t
were marching towards us with all Convenient Expedition, and that
they were never known to be earlier in the Field than at that time;
That we our &s;elves were able to have kept our Ground as lea&s;t again&s;t
the <HI>French</HI> Army, till the re&s;t had come up, and that we had plentiful
Magazines at <HI>Treves</HI> to &s;upply us, which made our De&s;ertion &s;o much
the more &V;naccountable.</P>
<P><HI>And all this is confirm'd,</HI> (1.) Becau&s;e the Dyet of the Empire found
no fault in Prince <HI>Lewis</HI>'s Conduct, but immediately made him <HI>Gene|rali&s;&s;imo</HI>
of all their Forces; and (2.) Becau&s;e afterwards when <HI>Mar|&s;hall

<P><PB N="21" REF="23">
Before I go on with this Rap&s;ody of a Charge, which he
brings in as a Di&s;cour&s;e of other Peoples, let me con&s;ider how
faintly he brings him&s;elf in, oppo&s;ing the&s;e Allegations; and
as he that de&s;ends an Argument Ill, gives it up; let me tell
this Gentleman, what he might have &s;aid to contradict the&s;e
Sugge&s;tions, if they had not been of his own contriving, and
how ea&s;ily have confuted them.</P>
<P><HI>1&s;t.</HI> His Innumeration of the Di&s;advantages of the la&s;t
Campaign are wrong &s;tated, fal&s;e in Fact, or maliciou&s;ly
&s;train'd, to &s;erve the turn of Slander, for which they are; tho'
very weakly calculated.</P>
<P><HI>1&s;t.</HI> It appears the <HI>French</HI> were not broken, and di&s;tracted
in their Mea&s;ures, but &s;ettl'd, ready, and &s;edately re&s;olv'd
what to do; and this appears, in that they never offer'd to
make Detachments from the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> where they had fix'd
their Mea&s;ures: It appears they knew the <HI>Germans</HI> were not in
a Condition to hurt them, and that on the other hand, they
were in a Condition to expect the wor&s;t the Duke's Forces
could do without them; of which more pre&s;ently.</P>
<P><HI>2d.</HI> The De&s;igns and Negotiations of the <HI>French</HI> to break the
Confederacy, by rai&s;ing Di&s;putes, and obliging the Northern
Princes to withdraw their Troops, are &s;o far an Argument a|gain&s;t,
that they rai&s;e the Glory of the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI>
on a double Account; Fir&s;t, In that, if they had conceiv'd
Hopes of them from the Di&s;appointment on the <HI>Mo&s;elle,</HI> the
Advantage did not prove &s;ufficient to enable them to fini&s;h
tho&s;e De&s;igns: Secondly, The Conduct of the Duke, &s;ince the
Campaign, to the Honour of his Wi&s;dom, as the other is of
his Courage, has not only prevented their effecting tho&s;e De|&s;igns,
but remov'd the very Cau&s;es of them, in di&s;&s;olving all
the pretended Di&s;putes and Quarrels, and E&s;tabli&s;hing a Good
Under&s;tanding among tho&s;e Northern Princes, to the utter
di&s;appointing the Expectations of a Party here, who, we &s;ee,
lye ready to TACK every Cro&s;s Event, to the Sugge&s;tions of
Mi&s;-conduct.</P>
<P>Putting the Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Lubeck,</HI> the In&s;urrection of <HI>Bavaria,</HI>
and the Succe&s;s in <HI>Hungary</HI> to the &s;ame Account, are Ab&s;ur|dities
<PB N="22" REF="24">
too gro&s;s to need a Reply, and as they have all receiv'd
a Cheque &s;ince, are of no Moment: The Affair of <HI>Lubeck</HI>
happen'd upon the Mortality of a Per&s;on, which, as no Body
could fore&s;ee, &s;o the &s;ame Di&s;pute would have follow'd when|ever
it had happen'd. The In&s;urrection of <HI>Bavaria</HI> was long
before concerted; but if it was ha&s;ten'd by this, it was an
Admirable Piece of Service, to delude them into a Precipitati|on
of their Affairs, and to form that Revolt in <HI>December,</HI> when
they were certain to be immediately &s;urrounded with all the
Forces of the Empire; which, if they had done in <HI>July</HI> be|fore,
or delay'd to the Summer following, might have unra|vel'd
all the Chain of Succe&s;&s;es of the preceeding Campaign,
been fatal to the Confederacy, and made the Victory at <HI>Blen|heim</HI>
of no Effect to us. As to the Succe&s;s of the <HI>Hungarians</HI>
this la&s;t Campaign, I &s;uppo&s;e the Author had not had an Ac|count
of them, and &s;poke by gue&s;s, he never el&s;e would have
call'd Prince <HI>Ragotsky</HI>'s being beaten at <HI>Scibo,</HI> and lo&s;ing all his
Footing in <HI>Tran&s;ilvania,</HI> any thing like Succe&s;s&mdash;but we mu&s;t
bear with a great deal of &s;uch incoherent Arguing, before we
have done with a General Detractor from Univer&s;al Merit.&mdash;</P>
<P>As to the Differences between the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> and the
<HI>States of Holland,</HI> and that King &s;ending Troops to a&s;&s;i&s;t the
<HI>Swede,</HI> they appear meer <HI>Chimera's,</HI> coin'd at <HI>Sutton,</HI> forg'd in
a di&s;temper'd Head, full of a New Party-Frenzy, which &s;erve
only as Embelli&s;hments to eke out his Cau&s;e, and I leave them
as Fictions, that by the Con&s;equence of Things, contradict
them&s;elves, and need no Reply.</P>
<P>Now let us &s;ee his Logick.&mdash;&startq;None of which (&s;ays he) could
have happen'd,&endq; if we had &s;tuck to our fir&s;t Scheme. Mon&s;trous
Ab&s;urdity! what not the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Lubeck</HI> dye, and the <HI>Hol|&s;teineer</HI>'s
Di&s;pute with the <HI>Dane</HI> about the Succe&s;&s;ion? What
not the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> claim his Part in the E&s;tate of the late
King <HI>William?</HI> Not the <HI>French</HI> Intrigue with the Northern
Princes, nor the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> have continu'd in Arms? for Suc|ce&s;s
they have had none: None of all the&s;e Things have hap|pen'd,
if the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> had &s;tood his Ground on the
<HI>Mo&s;elle!</HI> this is very &s;trange, and if form'd into an Argument,
would hang very ill together.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="25">
But to come to the next Branch of his Argument, there I
&s;hall tell him with a little more Rea&s;on, not what would not
have happen'd, but really what would. As <HI>1&s;t. Leige,</HI> and its
whole Principality had been lo&s;t, <HI>Mae&s;trich't</HI> be&s;ieg'd, and by
Con&s;equence taken, the Dutch Frontiers in&s;ulted, and at the
Mercy of 60000 Men, with no Army to defend it; for all the
In&s;antry Mon&s;ieur <HI>Averquerque</HI> had, would not have been &s;uf|ficient
to have Garri&s;on'd their Frontiers: Indeed the Diffe|rence
between the <HI>Pru&s;&s;ian</HI> and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and &s;ending Troops
to joyn the <HI>Swede,</HI> might have been prevented, for they would
both have had other Work; the one, to defend his Dutchy of
<HI>Cleve;</HI> and the other, to take Care of the Capitals of their
Provinces.</P>
<P>And this leads me, to put the Ca&s;e in a true Light, which
will unriddle all this My&s;tery, and expo&s;e the wretched Poli|ticks
of the&s;e Men.</P>
<P>The Que&s;tion is not, Whether the <HI>Germans</HI> were a coming, or
no? Or, Whether Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> was too backward? but did
they join in the Numbers concerted? Supply'd for Action,
and Time enough to enable the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> as his
Grace had concerted, to pu&s;h the <HI>French</HI> with Advantage, and
to force them to alter their Mea&s;ures on the <HI>Maes,</HI> and &s;end
Detachment to the <HI>Mo&s;elle,</HI> or to enable his Grace to have
made &s;uch Detachments as &s;hould have made Mon&s;ieur <HI>Au|verquerque</HI>
a Match for the Duke of <HI>Bavaria?</HI></P>
<P>It this was not done, 'tis nothing to us where the Fault
lay as to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e; but 'tis plain, the Retreat does
not lye at the Duke of <HI>Marborough</HI>'s Door, any more than
the Palatine General's abandoning <HI>Treves,</HI> and Burning the
Magazine can be laid to his Charge, which I doubt not,
had he been at his Grace's Di&s;po&s;e &s;hould have co&s;t him
his Head.</P>
<P>But &s;ays this Wi&s;e State&s;man, he might have &s;tood his
Ground in Spight of the Mare&s;chal <HI>Villars</HI> with that Army
he had; Excellent Politicks! who doubts it? And had his
Grace been touch't with <HI>French</HI> Coun&s;els, as is afterwards
horridly &s;ugge&s;ted, he had certainly &s;tood his Ground; and
<PB N="24" REF="26">
from the little Knowledge I have of the <HI>French</HI> King's Sa|gacity,
that Prudent Monarch would have given him Four
Millions of Livres to gratifie the <HI>Root of all Evil, with
which this Gentleman reproaches him,</HI> on Condition to have &s;taid
on the <HI>Mo&s;elle;</HI> and my Rea&s;on is &s;hort.</P>
<P>1. Becau&s;e he would have rais'd trebble that Sum in
Contributious upon the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Pru&s;&s;ian</HI> in the mean Time,
be&s;ides perhaps penetrating into the Bowels of their Coun|try,
and bidding fair for their De&s;truction; for my Part in a
fair State of the Succe&s;&s;es, that Army might have made on
the <HI>Dutch,</HI> with no Army in the Field to oppo&s;e them, for that
would have been the Ca&s;e; I would have compounded with
them for <HI>Mae&s;trich</HI> aud <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> and whether the Conque&s;t
of the la&s;t would have given them Leave to have &s;pread their
Troops by way of Contribution; I leave to the Inhabitants
of <HI>&V;trecht</HI> one Way, and <HI>Overy&s;&s;el</HI> another Way to determine.</P>
<P>Here had been fine Work indeed, and &s;uch as I doubt
not, our Gentlemen would have been very well pleas'd with,
and the <HI>Dutch</HI> them&s;elves &s;oon &s;aw this, as is plain by the
pre&s;&s;ing In&s;tances they made to his Grace to countermarch
and come to &s;ave them.</P>
<P>Now from this let us come to the Ju&s;tice of Things, The
Duke has to his Grace's Immortal Honour, and to the Ho|nour
of his Country, the Command of the <HI>Dutch</HI> as well as
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army, he is <HI>their</HI> General as well as <HI>our</HI> General; would
it have been rea&s;onable when the <HI>Dutch</HI> found them&s;elves inva|ded
by a powerful Enemy, and &s;end to their own General
to bring their own Troops to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, that he &s;hould
refu&s;e to come; would not every General Officer under him,
that had in a Council of War voted to have refus'd, been
a Traytor to his Country? Was it not their Duty and
his Duty, to take Care of that Country that paid and em|ploy'd
them; and who&s;e Servants they were? What wretched
Prie&s;t's Policy is this, that would have had the Duke &s;tood
his Ground, tho' in no Condition; for Want of the <HI>Ger|mans</HI>
A&s;&s;i&s;tance to act Offen&s;ively, and &s;uffer the <HI>Dutch</HI> to be
ruin'd and over-run, while he commanded their Army that
&s;hould defend them.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="27">
Farther, for the Rea&s;on of the Ca&s;e, who was it fit the
Duke &s;hould Expo&s;e? The <HI>Germans</HI> who had expos'd him, and
who were not in a Condition, for want of Supplys to act; or,
the <HI>Dutch</HI> who had done their Part Honourably, parted
with their Army from Home, to joyn in concerted Mea&s;ures
with their Confederates, had March'd 160 Miles, and
fac'd the Enemy, before the other were in Condition to ap|pear.</P>
<P>Had our Author offer'd the&s;e Rea&s;ons to his pretended Ob|jections,
he would have clear'd him&s;elf of being the Ob|jector,
forming the Cavil fir&s;t; and then pretending not
to know what to &s;ay to it; nor could he have been tax'd with
&s;uch Folly, as to pretend to be &s;urpriz'd with an Objections, which
every Boy of ten Years old, that has but read the Account of
the&s;e Things, might have an&s;wer'd.</P>
<P>The Que&s;tion is not here about Prince <HI>Lewis</HI>'s Con|duct;
I &s;ee no Rea&s;on to object again&s;t that Prince, or why the
Diet of the Empire &s;hould not declare him <HI>Generali&s;&s;imo;</HI> the
after Conduct of that Prince clears him of all Su&s;picion of Cor|re&s;pondence
with the Enemy; whether Affairs on that &s;ide
would not have been mended &s;ooner, if that Honour had been
confer'd &s;ooner, I will not determine; but all this, let it lay
the Mi&s;carriage where it will, &s;erves but to a&s;&s;i&s;t in clearing
up the Conduct of the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> which indeed re|quires
this Vindication, more to Expo&s;e the Empty and Weak
Efforts of an Expiring Party to renew their Cau&s;e, than to
open any Body's Eyes to the Cleanne&s;s of his Character, which
is approv'd by the Confe&s;&s;ion of his wor&s;t Enemies abroad, and
the Univer&s;al Applau&s;e of all the Confederacy.</P>
<P>We have now four Pages &s;pent in a mo&s;t Labour'd Slander
upon the Duke, in the Action of <HI>Overy&s;che,</HI> wherein this Gen|tleman
taking quite different Steps from my Lord <HI>H&mdash;&s;ham,</HI>
and with much more Malice, would in&s;inuate that the Duke had
really no Intent to Fight the <HI>French</HI> at all, but to bring the
Army on pretence of Fighting, to &s;ome &s;uch Exigence as
&s;hould make the <HI>Dutch</HI> Deputies refu&s;e to Fight, give the Duke
Cau&s;e to complain, and open the Door to a large, or more un|limited
Command in the Army.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="28">
Now tho' this is a far-fetch't, unprov'd and improbable
Sugge&s;tion, yet the following Clau&s;e is &s;o horrid, that no|thing
but a Spirit of Envy and Detraction can po&s;&s;ibly form
in the Thoughts; <HI>viz.</HI> That his Grace &s;hould covet this
Command in the Army, with a De&s;ign to enable him and
countenance him, in making an advantagious Bargain with
<HI>France,</HI> by felling them a Peace, to the inconceivable Lo&s;s
and Detriment of his own Country and the Confederates.</P>
<P>This black Sugge&s;tion is &s;o directly of the Devil, and &s;o
maliciou&s;ly inferr'd, that not the wor&s;t Enemy his Grace ever
yet had, nor the be&s;t Advocates for this Cau&s;e ever yet had Gall
enough to invent, or Front enogh to advance to the World;
and I cannot but think, 'tis Vindication enough to the Duke of
<HI>Marlborough</HI> to expo&s;e this Horrid Slander to the World.</P>
<P>To tell us, a General, who having but the la&s;t Year been
tru&s;ted with the Power of the whole Confederacy, and
commanded ab&s;olutely two of the Greate&s;t Men in the
World, Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden</HI> and Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> of <HI>Savoy;</HI>
that commanded the United Armies of the <HI>Empire, England,
Holland, Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>He&s;&s;ia,</HI> that having an Uncontroul'd
Power, exercis'd that Power with the Utmo&s;t Fidelity, Va|lour

of &s;uch Conduct and Faithfulne&s;s, be in one Year de&s;cended
to the Meane&s;s of a Mercenary Traytor, that &s;eeks an Ab|&s;olute
Command to &s;ell his Country to the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>What horrid In&s;inuations are the&s;e! Now let us &s;ee their Sup|port:
No Wonder he that form'd &s;uch a Slander breaks in upon
his Truth to uphold it, and flies to a Refuge of L&mdash;s to make
it out.</P>
<P>To make this probable, the Duke is tax'd with being in
Private with his Pri&s;oner Mon&s;ieur <HI>D' Alegre,</HI> and with
great Intimacy with <HI>Don Pedro De Ronquillo</HI> the <HI>Spaniard.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall only &s;ay to the&s;e, <HI>1&s;t.</HI> That neither of the&s;e Things
are prov'd. And, <HI>2dly.</HI> That I am credibly inform'd <HI>both
are fal&s;e,</HI> and that his Grace never admitted the lea&s;t Pri|vacy
with either of the&s;e Per&s;ons, or ever di&s;cour&s;ed them
without &s;uch Witne&s;&s;es pre$ent, as are more than &s;ufficient

the&s;e; and <HI>if this be &s;o,</HI> as I have good Rea&s;on to believe,
The Wi&s;dom and Prudence of the Duke is very con&s;picu|ous,
in &s;o happily Guarding him&s;elf again&s;t the Private and
Clande&s;tine Attempts of Invincible Prejudice.</P>
<P>But what can &s;ecure Men of Vertue and Character from

and Incon&s;i&s;tency of which, is a Demon&s;tration
of their inveterate, but ill-concerted Spleen.</P>
<P>No General, like his Grace the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> has
been &s;o much for pu&s;hing the <HI>French</HI> to fight, as <HI>the Only
Way to deal with them,</HI> and to bring the War to a Speedy
Conclu&s;ion; and to charge a General with <HI>Protracting the
War,</HI> that is always for Fighting, is ju&s;t Arguing from Contra|ries,
and Choo&s;ing a Rea&s;on <HI>for it,</HI> that was the only Rea|&s;on
<HI>again&s;t it;</HI> but to &s;uch Methods they will always be
driven who attempt to oppo&s;e Demon&s;trations, and to ec|clip&s;e
the Glory that by a Channel of great Actions is illu|&s;trated
&s;o many Ways, as makes it impo&s;&s;ible to be &s;ully'd
by Slander and Reproach.</P>
<P>But we cannot end here, his Grace is charg'd in &s;o many

Now we find this Gentleman removing his Attack, and the next

there never &s;hall be a Ca&s;e, where a Man in &s;uch a De&s;ign &s;hall have
<HI>nothing to &s;ay;</HI> whether to his own purpo&s;e, or to his Adver&s;arys;
and I cannot but ob&s;erve here, how naturally the very Methods
he has taken to blacken this Gentleman, if he could, even by his own

for him in &s;uch a Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Charge again&s;t this Gentleman is, that <HI>the Memorial took
no Notice of him</HI> from whence this Author advances, that they were
&s;ure of his Friend&s;hip, and he mu&s;t, one time or other, be of a Party
with them, becau&s;e they had not di&s;oblig'd him.</P>
<P>This is both a Barbarous, and a Ridiculous way of Arguing; it

&s;aid nothing, <HI>they had nothing to &s;ay;</HI> &s;ince that warm Libel mi&s;s'd no
Body they could form any thing again&s;t, tho' much higher and lower
than this Gentleman.</P>
<P>Had he happen'd to &s;ay, they car'd not to bring to Remem|brance,
the Man, who having out-&s;hot them in their own Bow, had
pu&s;h'd them upon tho&s;e Follies and Extravagances, which at the &s;ame
time that they ruin'd their Cau&s;e, expos'd their Politicks, turn'd 'em
off the Stage, and made Fools of 'em too.</P>
<P>Had he happen'd to &s;ay, that Great State&s;-man handed them
on to their Occa&s;ional Bills, Tackings, Dangerous Experiments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
and &s;eeing beyond their Reach, drove them like <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Fool,
to the Correction of the Stocks, and made their Fu$y their De|&s;truction?</P>
<P>The&s;e
had been fairer Sugge&s;tions for their &s;aying nothing of him in
the Memorial, than any this Author makes, and may be &s;ubjoyn'd to a
great many more, which are as u&s;eful in the Con&s;equence as the Moral.</P>
<P>Why el&s;e do the&s;e Gentlemen complain of being betray'd, and that
he has betray'd both Partys; that he has not betray'd the Whigs, the
Con&s;equence, and his pre&s;ent Services demon&s;trate; but pray Gen|tlemen
what did he betray you in?</P>
<P>Was it, that when he had prevail'd upon you to do your Duty, <HI>viz.</HI>
to recognize the Rites of the People, which you comply'd with, not
by Inclination, but as you thought it was an in&s;ulting your Prince;
when you afterwards addre&s;s'd the Queen to extend Her Prerogative,
he would not follow;&mdash;Was it, that when you thought him your
own, and expected him to joyn in betraying your Country, invading
the Rights of the People, and per&s;ecuting the Di&s;&s;enters, he refus'd
you? If the&s;e are the Betrayings of the Party, we are content; if not,
it had been infinitely obliging, as well as ju&s;t, if this Gentleman had
told us in what he betray'd them.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="33">
As to the other Party, how are they betray'd? We find him in the
Mini&s;try and the Di&s;&s;enters &s;afe, their Toleration &s;ecur'd, their Li|berties
unbroken, and the whole Party ea&s;y; how are they betray'd?</P>
<P>But he has betray'd tho&s;e Per&s;ons that tru&s;ted him with their Complaints,
again&s;t &s;ome of the Chief Mini&s;ters, by his Faint and Partial Attacks.</P>
<P>This is a Dark Saying, <HI>1st.</HI> It remains unprov'd, that their Com|plaints
would bear more warm Attacks, for weak and trifling Accu|&s;ations
are no Novelties in this Age; and if all Men are betray'd,
who&s;e frivolous Charges are not vigorou&s;ly pu&s;h'd on, according to
the warmth of their own mi&s;guided Pa&s;&s;ions? All wi&s;e Men mu&s;t be|tray
&s;ome people of every Party.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Extreams he hated of every &s;ide, and &s;o I come to my
Author again.</P>
<P>This Gentleman <HI>always hated the Extreams of all Partys,</HI> and there|fore
&s;ays our Author, is <HI>extreamly hated of all Partys.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>And &s;o &s;hall every Man be hated that oppo&s;es the Extreams of Par|tys,
and yet the&s;e <HI>Extreams of all Partys</HI> are the only Things dange|rous
to this Nation's Pro&s;perity; the High-flying mad Men of the
Age hate this Gentleman no doubt of it, and &s;o they do every wi&s;e
and hone&s;t Men be&s;ides; and a wi&s;e Man <HI>would be hated by &s;uch;</HI> for to
what end can a Man de&s;ire to be valu'd by the Enemies of his Country?</P>
<P>This therefore, that our Author de&s;igns as a Satyr upon this Gen|tleman,
is really the Greate&s;t Panegyrick upon his Conduct that could
have been made; and no Man that will pur&s;ue the Intere&s;t of <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
unbya&s;s'd by Partys, but &s;hall in their turn be hated, cen&s;ur'd
and abandon'd by all Partys.</P>
<P>Had Mr. <HI>Stephens</HI> de&s;cended to Particulars with this Gentleman,
and told the World when any thing for the publick Good, for
the Peoples Liberties, for the National Intere&s;t, was oppo&s;ed by
him, then it indeed might have been needful to have examin'd his
Character, in order to vindicate him; but if every Law for the
publick Good, if Tolerations, if Acts of Securities, Abjurations,
and Settlements, if Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, if Recognition of Rights
of the People, if all the&s;e have had his Affirmatives, if all your
Dangerous Experiments, Occa&s;ional Bills, Tackings, <HI>&amp;c,</HI> owe their
De&s;truction to his Conduct, I would have all Men of Conduct

their Friends among their Enemies.</P>

The Noble Union of your Actions being built on a Truth of
De&s;ign, will never &s;hake with the fruitle&s;s Gu&s;t of Party-Storms:
This Nation will never let &s;uch Men fall under the
Feet of Envy, who&s;e true and &s;ucce&s;sful Endeavours are con|&s;tantly
aim'd at the Publick Safety.</P>
<P><HI>Henry.</HI> the III<HI>d.</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> when bani&s;h'd by the Rebellious
Pari&s;ians, and treated in a mo&s;t Villainous Manner by the
Clergy, and the Rabble, he &s;ent to the K. of <HI>Navarr,</HI> to come
to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance; at their fir&s;t Enterview expre&s;s'd him&s;elf
with great Concern at the barbarous U&s;age he met with, par|ticularly
from the Clergy, to whom he had been e&s;pecially ob|liging;
The K. of <HI>Navarr</HI> reply'd, <HI>Sir, Be not concern'd, let
us March; your Maje&s;ty has nothing to do but to Conquer.</HI></P>
<P>Pardon the Allu&s;ion; your Honours have nothing to do, but
to pur&s;ue the happy Mea&s;ures you have taken to reduce the E|nemy;
do but conquer, all the&s;e Things will dye of them&s;elves;
Malice will run her &s;elf out of Breath, if the&s;e Men could &s;our
your Tempers, and turn your Re&s;olutions, cool your Zeal, and
le&s;&s;en your Affections for the Publick Good, and for the Safety
of Her Maje&s;ty's Intere&s;t; they would have their End, and
would quickly find other Malecontents to Callum$iate you,
and call you Con&s;pirators again&s;t your Country.</P>
<P>It is therefore with a pardonable Pre&s;umption, an humble
Author ventures to &s;ay, All good Men are humble Sollicitors
to your Honours, that you would neither be di&s;courag'd or pro|vok'd
by the&s;e Sons of Ingratitude, that nothing may remove
you from the &s;teady Re&s;olutions you have hitherto pur&s;u'd, for
the Glory of our Soveraign, the Safety of the Prote&s;tant Religi|on,
the Pro&s;perity of our Commerce, and the Liberty of
<HI>England.</HI></P>
