<HEAD>LESSONS
FOR CHILDREN,
OF THREE YEARS OLD.</HEAD>
<P>CHARLES, what a cle|ver
thing it is to read!
A little while ago, you know,
you could only read little
<PB N="4" REF="3">
words; and you were forced
to &s;pell them c&mdash;a&mdash;t, cat;
d&mdash;o&mdash;g, dog. Now you can
read pretty &s;tories, and I am
going to write you &s;ome.</P>
<P>Do you know why you
are better than Pufs? Pu&s;s
can play as well as you; and
Pu&s;s can drink milk, and lie
upon the carpet; and &s;he
<PB N="5" REF="4">
can run as fa&s;t as you, and
fa&s;ter too, a great deal; and
&s;he can climb trees better;
and &s;he can catch mice,
which you cannot do. But
can Pu&s;s talk? No. Can
Pu&s;s read? No. Then that
is the rea&s;on why you are
better than Pu&s;s&mdash;becau&s;e
<PB N="6" REF="5">
you can talk and read. Can
Pierrot, your dog, read?
No. Will you teach him?
Take the pin and point to
the words. No&mdash;he will not
learn. I never &s;aw a little
dog or cat learn to read.
But little boys can learn. If
you do not learn, Charles,
you are not good for half as
<PB N="7" REF="6">
much as a Pu&s;s. You had
better be drowned.</P>
<P>What a clock is it,
Charles? it is twelve o'clock.
It is noon. Come in the
garden then. Now where is
the &s;un? Turn your face to|wards
him. Look at the &s;un.
<PB N="8" REF="7">
That is South; always when
it is twelve o'clock, and
you look at the &s;un, your
face is towards the South.
Now turn to your left hand.
Look forwards. That is
Ea&s;t. In the morning, when
it is going to be light, you
mu&s;t look ju&s;t there, and
pre&s;ently you will &s;ee the
<PB N="9" REF="8">
&s;un get up. Always in the
morning look there for the
&s;un; for the &s;un ri&s;es in the
Ea&s;t. Now turn your back
to the &s;un. Look &s;traight
forwards. That is North.
Now turn to your left hand.
Look forwards. That is
We&s;t. When you have had
your &s;upper, and it is going
<PB N="10" REF="9">
to be night, look for the &s;un
ju&s;t there. He is always
there when he goes to bed;
for the &s;un &s;ets in the We&s;t.
North, South, Ea&s;t, We&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">
The wind blows. Which
way does the wind blow?
Take out your handkerchief.
Throw it up. The wind
blows it this way. The
wind comes from the north.
The wind is north. It is a
<PB N="12" REF="11">
cold wind. The wind was
we&s;t ye&s;terday, then it was
warm.</P>
<P>Rain comes from the
clouds. Look, there are
black clouds. How fa&s;t they
move along! Now they
have hid the &s;un. They
<PB N="13" REF="12">
have covered up the &s;un,
ju&s;t as you cover up your
face when you throw a hand|kerchief
over it. There is
a little bit of blue &s;ky &s;till.
Now there is no blue &s;ky at
all: it is all black with the
clouds. It is very dark,
like night. It will rain &s;oon.
<PB N="14" REF="13">
Now it begins. What large
drops! The ducks are very
glad, but the little birds are
not glad; they go and &s;hel|ter
them&s;elves under the
trees. Now the rain is over.
It was only a &s;hower. Now
the flowers &s;mell &s;weet, and
the &s;un &s;hines, and the little
birds &s;ing again, and it is
<PB N="15" REF="14">
not &s;o hot as it was before
it rained.</P>
<P>We will drink tea out of
doors. Bring the tea-things.
Come, fetch your hat. It
is very plea&s;ant. But here
is no table. What mu&s;t we
do? O, here is a large round
<PB N="16" REF="15">
&s;tump of a tree, it will do
very well for a table. But we
have no chairs. Here is a
&s;eat of turf, and a bank al|mo&s;t
covered with violets;
we &s;hall &s;it here, and you
and Billy may lie on the
carpet. The carpet is in
the parlour. Yes, there is a
carpet in the parlour, but
<PB N="17" REF="16">
there is a carpet here too.
What is it? The gra&s;s is
the carpet out of doors.
Pretty green &s;oft carpet! and
it is very large, for it &s;preads
every where, over all the
fields, and over all the mea|dows:
and it is very plea|&s;ant
for the &s;heep and the
<PB N="18" REF="17">
lambs to lie down upon. I
do not know what they
would do without it, for
they have no feather bed to
&s;leep upon.</P>
<P>It is a plea&s;ant evening.
Come hither, Charles, look
at the &s;un. The &s;un is in
<PB N="19" REF="18">
the We&s;t. Yes, becau&s;e he
is going to &s;et. How pretty
the &s;un looks! We can
look at him now; he is not
&s;o bright as he was at dinner|time,
when he was up high
in the &s;ky. And how beau|tiful
the clouds are! There
are crim&s;on clouds, and
purple and gold-coloured
<PB N="20" REF="19">
clouds. Now the &s;un is go|ing
down down a great pace.
Now we can &s;ee only half
of him. Now we cannot
&s;ee him at all. Farewell, &s;un!
till to morrow morning.</P>
<P>But now, Charles, turn
your face the other way,
to the Ea&s;t. What is it
that &s;hines &s;o behind the
<PB N="21" REF="20">
trees? Is it a fire? No,
it is the moon. It is very
large; and how red it is!
like blood. The moon is
round now, becau&s;e it is full
moon; but it will not be
&s;o round tomorrow night;
it will lo&s;e a little bit: and
the next night it will lo&s;e a
little bit more; and more
<PB N="22" REF="21">
the next night; and &s;o on,
till it is like your bow when
it is bent: and it will not be
&s;een till after you are in bed:
and it will grow le&s;s and le&s;s,
till in a fortnight there will
be no moon at all. Then,
after that, there will be a
new moon; and you will
&s;ee it in the afternoon; and
<PB N="23" REF="22">
it will be very very thin at
fir&s;t, but it will grow rounder
and bigger every day, till at
la&s;t, in another fortnight, it
will be a full moon again like
this, and you will &s;ee it ri&s;e
again behind the trees.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="23">
Do you know what rai|&s;ins
are? They are grapes
dried a great deal. Grapes,
you know, grow upon vines;
but rai&s;ins are made of larg|er
grapes than tho&s;e upon
the vine in the garden: they
come from a great way off.
Do you know what &s;ugar
<PB N="25" REF="24">
comes from? Sugar comes
from a cane like a walking|&s;tick,
that grows in the
ground; they &s;queeze the
juice out, and boil it a great
deal, and that makes &s;ugar.
And what is tea? Tea is a
leaf that grows upon a &s;hrub,
and that is dried a great deal.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="25">
Charles wants &s;ome bread
and butter&mdash;But the bread
is not baked. Then bid
Chri&s;topher Clump heat his
oven and bake it&mdash;But the
loaf is not kneaded. Then
bid little Margery take the
dough and knead it&mdash;But the
<PB N="27" REF="26">
&s;lour is not ground. Then
take it to the mill, and bid
Roger the miller grind it
&mdash;But the corn is not thre&s;h|ed.
Then bid John Dobbins
take his flail and thre&s;h it&mdash;But
the corn is not reaped.
Then bid Dick Clodpole
take his &s;ickle and cut it&mdash;
But the wheat is not &s;own.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="27">
Then bid Farmer Diggory
take the &s;eed and &s;ow it&mdash;
But the field is not ploughed.
Then bid Ralph Wi&s;eacre
take the hor&s;es and plough
it&mdash;But the plough is not
made. Then go to Hum|phrey
Hiccory the carpenter,
and bid him make one&mdash;But
there is never a plough-&s;hare.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="28">
Then bid Firebra&s;s the &s;mith
go to his anvil and beat one.
&mdash;But we have no butter.
Then go to market, Su&s;an,
and buy &s;ome. But the but|ter
is not churned. Then
take your churn, Dolly, and
churn &s;ome&mdash;But the cow
is not milked. Then take
your pail, Cicely, and milk
<PB N="30" REF="29">
it&mdash;Now, Betty, pray &s;pread
Charles a &s;lice of bread and
butter.</P>
<P>Charles, do not you re|member
the caterpillar we
put into a paper box, with
&s;ome mulberry leaves for it
to eat? Let us go and look
<PB N="31" REF="30">
at it. It is gone&mdash;here is no
caterpillar&mdash;there is &s;ome|thing
in the box; what is
it? I do not know. It is
a little ball of yellow &s;tuff.
Let us cut it open, perhaps
we may find the caterpillar.
No, here is nothing but a
&s;trange little grub, and it is
dead, I believe, for it does
<PB N="32" REF="31">
not move. Pinch it gently
by the tail. Now it &s;tirs:
it is not dead quite. Charles,
this grub is your caterpillar;
it is indeed. That yellow
&s;tuff is &s;ilk. The caterpillar
&s;pun all that &s;ilk, and cover|ed
it&s;elf up with it; and then
it was turned into this grub.
Take it, and lay it in the
<PB N="33" REF="32">
&s;un; we will come and look
at it again to morrow morn|ing
&mdash;Well, this is very &s;ur|pri&s;ing!
here is no grub at
all to be found. Did not we
put it on this &s;heet of paper
la&s;t night? Yes we did.
And no body has been in
the room to meddle with it?
No, no body at all has been
<PB N="34" REF="33">
in the room. Is there no|thing
upon the &s;heet of pa|per?
Yes, here is a white
butterfly. I wonder how it
came here; for the windows
are &s;hut. Perhaps the grub
is turned into a butterfly.
It is, indeed; and look, here
is the empty &s;hell of the
grub. Here is where the
<PB N="35" REF="34">
butterfly came out. But the
butterfly is too big; this
&s;hell could not hold him.
Yes, it did, becau&s;e his
wings were folded up, and
he lay very &s;nug. It is the
&s;ame, I a&s;&s;ure you, Charles;
all the pretty butterflies that
you &s;ee flying about were
<PB N="36" REF="35">
caterpillars once, and crawl|ed
on the ground.</P>
<P>Charles, you mu&s;t not go
out into the fields by your|&s;elf,
nor without leave.
You are a very little boy,
you know; and if you were
to venture out by your&s;elf
you would be lo&s;t; then you
<PB N="37" REF="36">
would cry, and night would
come, and it would be dark,
and you could not find your
way home, and you would
have no bed; you would be
forced to lie down in the
fields upon the wet cold
gra&s;s, and perhaps you would
die, and that would be a
&s;ad tale to tell.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="37">
I will tell you a &s;tory a|bout
a lamb. There was
once a Shepherd, who had
a great many &s;heep and lambs.
He took a great deal of care
of them, and gave them
&s;weet fre&s;h gra&s;s to eat, and
clear water to drink; and if
they were &s;ick he was very
good to them; and when
<PB N="39" REF="38">
they climbed up a &s;teep hill
and the lambs were tired, he
u&s;ed to carry them in his
arms; and when they were
all eating their &s;uppers in the
field he u&s;ed to &s;it upon a
&s;tile, and play them a tune,
and &s;ing to them; and &s;o
they were the happie&s;t &s;heep
and lambs in the whole world.
<PB N="40" REF="39">
But every night this Shep|herd
u&s;ed to pen them up
in a fold. Do you know
what a &s;heep-fold is? Well,
I will tell you. It is a place
like the court; but in&s;tead
of pales there are hurdles,
which are made of &s;ticks that
will bend, &s;uch as o&s;ier twigs;
and they are twi&s;ted and
<PB N="41" REF="40">
made very fa&s;t, &s;o that no|thing
can creep in, and no|thing
can get out. Well, and
&s;o every night when it grew
dark and cold, the Shepherd
called all his flock, &s;heep
and lambs, together, and
drove them into the fold,
and penned them up, and
there they lay as &s;nug and
<PB N="42" REF="41">
warm and comfortable as
could be, and nothing could
get in to hurt them, and the
dogs lay round on the out|&s;ide
to guard them, and to
bark if any body came near;
and in the morning the Shep|herd
unpenned the fold, and
let them all out again.</P>
<P>Now they were all very
<PB N="43" REF="42">
happy, as I told you, and
loved the Shepherd dearly,
that was &s;o good to them&mdash;all
except one fooli&s;h little
lamb. And this lamb did
not like to be &s;hut up every
night in the fold; and &s;he
came to her mother, who
was a wi&s;e old &s;heep, and
&s;aid to her, I wonder why
<PB N="44" REF="43">
we are &s;hut up &s;o every night!
the dogs are not &s;hut up,
and why &s;hould we be &s;hut
up? I think it is very hard,
and I will get away if I can,
I am re&s;olved, for I like to
run about where I plea&s;e,
and I think it is very plea|&s;ant
in the woods by moon|light&mdash;Then
the old &s;heep
<PB N="45" REF="44">
&s;aid to her, you are very &s;illy,
you little lamb, you had
better &s;tay in the fold. The
Shepherd is &s;o good to us
that we &s;hould always do as he
bids us; and if you wander
about by your&s;elf, I dare &s;ay
you will come to &s;ome harm.
I dare &s;ay not, &s;aid the little
lamb; and &s;o when the even|ing
<PB N="46" REF="45">
came, and the Shepherd
called them all to come into
the fold, &s;he would not come,
but crept &s;lily under a hedge
and hid her&s;elf; and when
the re&s;t of the lambs were
all in the fold and fa&s;t a&s;leep,
&s;he came out, and jumped,
and fri&s;ked, and danced a|bout;
and &s;he got out of
<PB N="47" REF="46">
the field, and got into a
fore&s;t full of trees, and a very
fierce wolf came ru&s;hing out
of a cave and howled very
loud. Then the &s;illy lamb
wi&s;hed &s;he had been &s;hut up
in the fold; but the fold
was a great way off&mdash;and the
wolf &s;aw her, and &s;eized
her, and carried her away to
<PB N="48" REF="47">
a di&s;mal dark den, all cover|ed
with bones and blood;
and there the wolf had two
cubs, and the wolf &s;aid to
them, Here, I have brought
you a young fat lamb&mdash;and
&s;o the cubs took her, and
growled over her a little
while, and then tore her to
pieces, and eat her up.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="48">
Gold is of a deep yellow
colour. It is very pretty
and bright. It is exceeding
heavy; heavier than any
thing el&s;e. Men dig it out
of the ground. Shall I take
my &s;pade and get &s;ome? No,
there is none in the fields
<PB N="50" REF="49">
hereabouts: It comes from
a great way off; and it lies
deeper a great deal than you
could dig with a &s;pade.
Guineas are made of gold;
and half guineas. This watch
is gold; and the looking
gla&s;s frame, and the picture
frames are gilt with gold.
Here is &s;ome leaf gold. What
<PB N="51" REF="50">
is leaf gold? It is gold beat
very thin; thinner than
leaves or paper.</P>
<P>Silver is white and &s;hining.
The &s;poons are &s;ilver; and
the waiter is &s;ilver; and
crowns, and half crowns,
and &s;hillings, and &s;ixpences
are made of &s;ilver. Silver
<PB N="52" REF="51">
comes from a great way off
too.</P>
<P>Copper is red. The ket|tles
and pots are made of
copper; and bra&s;s is made
of copper. Bra&s;s is bright
and yellow like gold almo&s;t.
This &s;auce-pan is made of
bra&s;s; and the locks upon the
door, and this candle&s;tick.
<PB N="53" REF="52">
What is this green upon the
&s;auce-pan? It is ru&s;ty; the
green is verdigris; it would
kill you, if you were to eat it.</P>
<P>Iron is very hard. It is
not pretty, but I do not
know what we &s;hould do
without it, for it makes us
a great many things. Go
and a&s;k the cook whether
<PB N="54" REF="53">
&s;he can roa&s;t her meat with|out
a &s;pit. Well, what does
&s;he &s;ay? She &s;ays &s;he can|not.
But the &s;pit is made
of iron; and &s;o are the tongs,
and the poker, and &s;hovel.
Go and a&s;k Dobbin if he can
plough without the plough|&s;hare.
Well, what does he
&s;ay? He &s;ays No, he can|not.
<PB N="55" REF="54">
But the plough-&s;hare
is made of iron. Will iron
melt in the fire? Put the
poker in and try. Well, is
it melted? No; but it is
red hot, and &s;oft; it will
bend. But I will tell you,
Charles; Iron will melt in
a very very hot fire when it
has been in a great while;
<PB N="56" REF="55">
then it will melt. Come,
let us go to the &s;mith's &s;hop.
What is he doing? He has
a forge: he blows the fire
with a great pair of bellows
to make the iron hot. Now
it is hot. Now he takes it
out with the tongs, and puts
it upon the anvil. Now he
beats it with a hammer.
<PB N="57" REF="56">
How hard he works! The
&s;parks fly about: pretty
bright &s;parks! What is the
black&s;mith making? he is
making nails, and hor&s;e &s;hoes,
and a great many things.</P>
<P>Steel is made of iron. Steel
is very bright, and &s;harp,
and hard. Knives and &s;ci&s;|&s;ars
are made of &s;teel.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="57">
Lead is &s;oft and very
heavy. Here is a piece: lift
it. There is lead in the ca&s;e|ment;
and the &s;pout is lead,
and the ci&s;tern is lead, and
bullets are made of lead.
Will lead melt in the fire?
Try: put &s;ome on the &s;ho|vel:
hold it over the fire.
Now it is all melted. Pour
<PB N="59" REF="58">
it into this ba&s;on of water.
How it hi&s;&s;es! What pretty
things it has made!</P>
<P>Tin is white and &s;oft. It
is bright too. The cani&s;ters,
and the dripping pan, and
the reflector are all covered
with tin.</P>
<P>Quick&s;ilver is very bright
like &s;ilver; and it is very
<PB N="60" REF="59">
heavy. See how it runs about!
You cannot catch it. You
cannot pick it up. There is
quick&s;ilver in the barometer.</P>
<P>Gold, Silver, Copper, Iron,
Lead, Tin, Quick&s;ilver.
One, two, three, four, five,
&s;ix, &s;even&mdash;What? Metals.
They are all dug out of the
ground.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="60">
Marble is dug out of the
ground. It is very hard:
you cannot cut it with a
knife; but the &s;tone cutter
can cut it. There is white
marble, and black, and
green, and red, and yellow
marble. The chimney piece
<PB N="62" REF="61">
is made of marble, and the
monument in the church.</P>
<P>Stones come out of the
ground, and flints. Here
are two flints: they are very
hard: &s;trike them both toge|ther.
Ah! here is fire; here
are &s;parks. Gravel is dug
out of gravel pits. They
put it into carts, and then
<PB N="63" REF="62">
make gravel walks with it,
or el&s;e mend the roads with
it. Chalk and fuller's earth
are dug out of the ground.
Coals come out of the ground.
Men dig great deep pits, and
&s;o they go down into them,
and get the coal with pick|axes,
and bring it up. Tho&s;e
men are colliers: they are
<PB N="64" REF="63">
very black, but I do not
know how we &s;hould do for
coals to make fires without
them. A great many things
come out of the ground;
&s;ure it is very deep! Yes,
it is very deep. If you were
to dig a hundred years, you
would never come to the
bottom, it is &s;o deep.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="64">
Charles, here is a ring $or
you to play with. See how
it &s;parkles! Hold it again&s;t
the &s;un. I &s;ee all colours
in it. What is this bright
&s;hining &s;tone? It is a
diamond. It is very hard;
you may write upon the gla&s;s
with it. A Ruby is red;
bright crim&s;on red. An
<PB N="66" REF="65">
Emerald is green. A Topaz
is yellow. A Saphire is
blue. The Amethy&s;t is
purple. The Garnet is red.
The Beryl is light green.
All the&s;e are dug out of the
earth. They are called jew|els
&mdash;precious &s;tones. And
here is a white round bead,
which is very pretty; it is
<PB N="67" REF="66">
in an ear-ring. What is it?
It is a pearl. And does that

No, it comes out of the &s;ea.
Pearls are found in oy&s;ter-&s;hells.</P>
<P>Will &s;tones melt in the
fire? No.</P>
<P>Does gla&s;s come out of
the ground? No. People
<PB N="68" REF="67">
make gla&s;s in a gla&s;s-hou&s;e.
They have great fires burning
all day and all night. You
&s;hall go to a gla&s;s-hou&s;e &s;ome
day and &s;ee them make it.</P>
<P>A tree has a root that goes
under the ground a great
way. The roots are like
<PB N="69" REF="68">
its legs: the tree could not
&s;tand without it. Then the
tree has a trunk; a large,
thick, &s;trait trunk. That
is its body. Then the tree
has branches. Tho&s;e are
like arms. They &s;pread out
very far. Then there are
boughs; and upon the
boughs, leaves and blo&s;&s;oms.
<PB N="70" REF="69">
Here is a blo&s;&s;om upon the
apple-tree. Will the blo&s;|&s;om
be always upon the tree?
No, it will fall off &s;oon:
perhaps it will fall off to
night. But then do you
know what comes in&s;tead of
the blo&s;&s;om? What? The
fruit. After the apple blo&s;|&s;oms,
there will be apples.
<PB N="71" REF="70">
Then if the blo&s;&s;om falls
off to night, &s;hall I come
here and get an apple to
morrow? No, you mu&s;t
have patience: there will
not be ripe apples a great
while yet. There will be
fir&s;t a little little thing hard|ly
bigger than a pin's head.
That will &s;well, and grow
<PB N="72" REF="71">
bigger every day, and harder,
till at la&s;t it will come to be
a great apple. But you
mu&s;t not eat it yet; you
mu&s;t let it hang till the &s;un
has made it red, and till you
can pull it off ea&s;ily. Now
it is ripe: it is as red as your
cheeks. Now gather it and
eat it.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="72">
Has a flower a root too?
Yes: here is a cow&s;lip; we
will pull it up. See, here
are roots like &s;trings; here
is the &s;tem of the cow&s;lip;
here is the foot-&s;talk; here
is the flower-cup; here are
the leaves of the flower; and
a pretty flower it is: fine
<PB N="74" REF="73">
yellow with crim&s;on &s;pots.
Here are the &s;eeds. If the
&s;eeds are put in the ground,
when they are ripe, another
flower will grow up.</P>

The Lion lives in a den.
He is very &s;trong. He has
a great deal of thick yellow
hair about his neck. That
is his mane. He has very
&s;harp claws; they would
tear you to pieces. Look
<PB N="78" REF="77">
at him. He is very angry.
See, he la&s;hes his &s;ides with
his tail: his eyes &s;parkle like
fire. He roars: how loud
he roars! It is very terrible.
He &s;hows his &s;harp teeth.
His tongue is very rough.
The Lion &s;leeps all day in
his den. When it is night,
he comes out, and prowls
<PB N="79" REF="78">
about to find &s;omething to
eat. He eats Cows, and
&s;heep, and hor&s;es; and he
would eat you too, if you
were within his reach. The
Lione&s;s has no mane. She
is like a great dog. Any
body would be afraid of a
Lion if he was to come.
Yes, any body would be
<PB N="80" REF="79">
afraid of a Lion, Charles:
but you need not be afraid
of dogs, they are good crea|tures.
I will tell you a
&s;tory.</P>
<P>There was once a little
boy, who was a &s;ad coward.
He was afraid of every thing
almo&s;t. He was afraid of
the two little kids, Nanny
<PB N="81" REF="80">
and Billy, when they came
and put their no&s;es through
the pales of the court; and
he would not pluck Billy
by the beard. What a &s;illy
little boy he was! Pray
what was his name? Nay,
indeed, I &s;hall not tell you
his name, for I am a&s;hamed
<PB N="82" REF="81">
of him. Well, he was very
much afraid of dogs too:
he always cried if a dog
barked, and ran away, and
took hold of his mamma's
apron like a baby. What a
fooli&s;h fellow he was! for
dogs do not hurt, you know;
they love little boys, and
play with them. Did you
<PB N="83" REF="82">
ever &s;ee a dog eat up a little
boy? No, never, I dare
&s;ay. Well; &s;o this &s;imple
little boy was walking by
him&s;elf one day, and a pret|ty
black dog came out of a
hou&s;e, and &s;aid Bow, wow;
bow, wow; and came to
the little boy, and jumped
upon him, and wanted to
<PB N="84" REF="83">
play with him; but the
little boy ran away. The
dog ran after him, and cried
louder, Bow, bow, wow;
but he only meant to &s;ay,
Goodmorrow, how do you
do? but this little boy was
&s;adly frightened, and ran
away as fa&s;t as ever he could,
without looking before him,
<PB N="85" REF="84">
and he tumbled into a very
dirty ditch, and there he lay
crying at the bottom of the
ditch, for he could not get
out: and I believe he would
have lain there all day, but
the dog was &s;o good-natured,
that he went to the hou&s;e
where the little boy lived&punc;
<PB N="86" REF="85">
on purpo&s;e to tell them
where he was. So when he
came to the hou&s;e, he
&s;cratched at the door, and
&s;aid, Bow wow; for he
could not &s;peak any plainer.
So they opened the door.</P>
<P>What do you want, you
black dog? we do not know
you. Then the dog went
<PB N="87" REF="86">
to Ralph the $ervant, and
pulled him by the coat, and
pulled him till he brought
him to the ditch; and the
dog and Ralph together got
the little boy out of the
ditch; but he was all over
mud, and quite wet, and
every body laughed at him
becau&s;e he was a coward.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="87">
Now Charles, my pen is
tired, I cannot write any
more at pre&s;ent, but if you
are a good boy perhaps I
may write you &s;ome more
&s;tories another time. Farewell.</P>
